<h2>Unintended  Consequences</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>Urd blinked as she looked around the devastation.  What had happened?<p>
  She hadn’t left  her room for the last several days, sulking while trying to come to grips with  the encounter she’d had with Hild, and wishing she wasn’t stuck with this damn  assignment.  Belldandy had tried coaxing  her out with sweets, and even Skuld had tried to cheer her up, but nothing  could drag her out of the black mood she had sunk into.  She hadn’t even been able to get a good drunk  on; she’d drained all the sake the first day and Belldandy wouldn’t buy her any  more, so she’d just sat in her room sober and hating her life.  <p>
  But something  had finally prompted her out of her funk, a nagging sense of something ... <em>missing.</em>   It had been growing for the last couple of days, and she’d spent several  hours this morning trying to narrow down what it might be, and eventually, she  had come looking for Mara.  Regardless of  how strange the demoness had been acting lately, or how frightening she had  been since the Terrible Master had possessed Urd, something had told the  goddess that Mara <em>needed</em> her.<p>
  No matter how  she had fought it, that sense wouldn’t go away.   It had nagged at her, pushed her out of her room, and finally had driven  her to the apartment complex where Mara made her lair.  There had been no answer, but all her senses  screamed at her as to the residuals of power within.  It had taken her all of three seconds to pick  the door with a credit card.<p>
  Now, surveying  the ruins of what had once been an apartment, she wondered if she had come too  late.  At a guess, this had happened days  ago.  She looked at the scorch marks on  everything, and the two wooden spikes embedded in the wall, trails of blood  dried under them…<p>
  So much blood.<p>
  She touched the  dried stain cautiously, and shuddered at the torrent of pain that clung to the  blood and the sure knowledge that it was Mara’s.  What could have done this to a Demon First  Class?  She looked around again, sure  whatever it had been was gone, but on edge.   If it could kill a demon…<p>
  A faint groan  came from the bedroom.  Urd blinked, then  pushed on the badly scarred door.<p>
  A soft golden  glow came from the bed, but Urd couldn’t make out what, or who, was on it.  She started to move forward, then stopped as  light poured from a magical circle on the floor.  The golden glow flared brightly for a second  as a pair of burning eyes floated above the circle, seeming to stare right  through her.  Urd took a step back as the  eyes closed and the circle faded.  She  recognized the signature on the ward, though she’d never seen anything like it  before.  What was the Dragon up to?<p>
  Another groan  drew her attention back to the bed, and she tried to step forward again, cautiously  touching her toe to the edge of the circle.   This time, it raised no protest and she crossed into the ward.<p>
  Instantly, she  felt the world outside fade from her senses, the ward sealing even her goddess  powers.  She staggered for a second as  she felt herself cut off, but concern for the still figure in the bed overrode  her wariness.  She knelt next to the  still form of Mara and brushed the hair back from the demoness’ face.<p>
  She breathed a  sigh of relief as she reassured herself that Mara was alive, the silent dread  that had driven her here fading.   Regardless of how Mara had been acting, they had once been friends.  They had grown up together, and played  together, inseparable to the point many had thought they were twins, but Urd’s  decision to become a goddess had driven a wedge between them, one that had  widened over the years as Mara had risen to become her nemesis.  Urd had at first been confused by the change  in Mara, then resentful, but she’d never been able to bring herself to hate her  one time best friend, no matter how angry she had gotten at the demoness for  disrupting her life or trying to mess with Belldandy and Keiichi.<p>
  She examined the  sleeping form more thoroughly, and her breath drew in as she noted one very  minor, but very significant change about Mara’s face.<p>
  Mara’s demon  marks had changed.  The scarlet split v  and paired triangles on her cheeks had vanished, to be replaced by golden  teardrop shaped designs noticeable against her pale skin only by the reflected  light of the sun peeking through the window.   Urd blinked at the curved teardrops, noting they looked almost like…<p>
  Claws?<p>
  Mara tossed  again and moaned slightly, then her eyes fluttered open.  As she focused on Urd, she smiled  weakly.  “Urd?” she said softly, just  barely loud enough to hear.  “He said you  would come.  He promised me you would be  here when I woke.”<p>
  Urd blinked, but  nodded.  “Yes Mara.  I’m here.”   She knelt by the bed.<p>
  Mara’s hand  shakily rose and touched Urd’s.  “I-I’m  sorry.  I never wanted Ragnarok.  Hild - Hild clouded my mind.”  She coughed weakly.  “She clouded my mind with hate.”<p>
  Years seemed to  roll back as all Urd could feel was concern for an old friend.  She couldn’t even feel the demonic aura Mara  had developed over the years.  “Don’t try  to talk Mara.  You’re weak.  Let me take you back to Morisato’s.  Bell  and I can help you get better.”<p>
  “Never hated  you, Urd.  Never…”<p>
  Urd nodded.  “I know Mara.   Rest.  You need to get  better.”  She reached out to stroke the  demoness’s hair.  “Go back to sleep for  now.  I’ll get Keiichi.”<p>
  The demoness  nodded.  “He said you’d come.”  She smiled.   “He promised.”<p>
  Her voice faded  as her eyes closed again and she drifted back to sleep.  Urd sat back on her heels as she contemplated  the demoness’ words.  Legend had been  talking to Mara?  And promised the  demoness that <em>she</em> was coming?  What was going on?  More and more she was starting to feel like a  pawn being played in some vast chess game, and she didn’t like the feeling.<p>
  Whatever was up,  Mara wasn’t the psycho she’d been lately.   And she was weak and injured.  She  looked down at the hand that was still holding hers, and shuddered at signs  that they’d been healed from being pierced.   Had Hild done this to her?  Had  her mom tortured Mara?  Because she  wasn’t hindering Urd enough?  Or because  Mara’s creature had killed Zhu Shu?  <p>
  She wished she  had the answers.<p>
  Gently, she  extracted her hand and went to the window, looking down to where Keiichi was  patiently waiting by his bike.  “Yo!  Morisato!  I need a hand up here.”  He looked up at where she had her head poked  out and waved before heading towards the building.<p>
  He was up a few  minutes later, blinking at the rubble.   “What happened here?  She blow  herself up?”  He kicked a burned pillow  out of the way.<p>
  Urd gave him a  dirty look.  “No.  I think she was attacked by my mom.  She’s been healed by someone, the Dragon, I  think, but she’s too weak to take care of herself.  We need to get her back to Bell.”<p>
  Keiichi did a  double take.  “Whoa.  She’s a demon, Urd.  And our biggest headache!  Even <em>you</em> said she’s been acting crazy.”<p>
  “She’s hurt,  Keiichi.”  Urd said, pleading.  “And I think she’s back to normal.  I can’t leave her here.  What if my mom comes back!  She’s defenseless!”<p>
  Keiichi looked  at the blood on the wall and the uncharacteristic desperation in Urd’s eyes and  nodded, “Okay.  I think there’s room for  you both in the side car, but you’re going to have her on your lap.”<p>
  Urd let out a  sigh of relief.  “That’s fine.  Let’s just get her out of here.”  She looked around the apartment nervously and  wiped her hands on her skirt.  She led  him into the bedroom, noting that the ward had already faded.  <p>
  As Keiichi  looked at Mara, he noted her extremely wan appearance and shook his head.  Then he blinked several times, sure his eyes  were playing tricks on him.<p>
  “Hey, what  happened to her markings?”<p>
  “I don’t  know.”  Urd confessed.  “This is how I found her.”  She lifted the sheets to slide Mara out of  bed then dropped them again.  “Oh,  cripes.  She’s naked.”<p>
  Keiichi  shrugged.  “Just wrap her up in the  blanket.  I’ll come back to grab some  clothes for her.”<p>
  Urd grimaced,  but nodded.  She put her hand on Mara’s  shoulder and gently shook her.<p>
  “Mara?  We need to move you.  We’re going to take you to Belldandy.”<p>
  Mara’s eyes  fluttered open and focused on Urd again.   “You’re really here?”  she  whispered, smiling.  “I thought it had to  be a dream.”<p>
  “No Mara, I’m  here.  But we need to move you.  We can’t carry you.  You have to stand.”<p>
  The demoness  smiled dreamily and nodded.  She did her  best to help Urd and Keiichi as they managed to get her on her feet and down  the hall to the elevator.  Mara pouted as  they waited for the car to go down.  “I’m  sorry.” she told Urd, trying to focus. “I feel so drifty.”<p>
  “It’s okay,  Mara.  You lost a lot of blood.” Urd said,  doing her best to hold up her side of the demoness<p>
  Getting her into  the side car with Urd was even trickier, but finally, the goddess had Mara  arranged on her lap so that Keiichi could drive without having a wreck.  Mara giggled softly as they pulled out of the  lot.<p>
  “He said you’d  come for me.”  she whispered, so softly Urd barely caught it over the sound of the  engine.  Her next words were lost to the  wind as they merged with traffic.<p>
  But Urd still  looked down at the demoness in shock at what she thought she’d heard.  As Mara laid her head on Urd’s shoulder and  fell asleep again, Urd blinked.<p>
  Then she passed  it off as a trick of the wind.  There was  no way Mara could have said, “I love you.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kasumi came in  from shopping and stopped as her rabbit ears twitched at a faint noise.  She put the groceries down and listened.<p>
  Was that… water?<p>
  Yes.  It was the sound of someone bathing.  She looked out the kitchen window over to the  bathing room as the sound came again.<p>
  Curious.  Soun and Genma had taken Sandal out to a  local gaming parlor, so the house should have been empty.<p>
  She quietly  crept down the hall past the dining room and approached the furo door, rolling  pin in hand.  As her hand touched the  door, there was a sound of the water bucket falling over.<p>
  She slid open  the door to find a wet and bedraggled kitten on the floor, looking up at her  curiously.  The overturned water bucket  was lying next to her.  <p>
  “China?  Whatever happened?”<p>
  The kitten  meowed, as if to say “I got wet!”<p>
  Kasumi  laughed.  “You poor thing.  Here let me get you dried off.”  She picked up the wet kitten and stepped  towards the towel draped over a hook by the tub.  Noting the strange fact that the furo was  full of fresh, steamy water, she failed to see the bar of soap, and with a  “Whoops!”  and a yowl from China, she  pitched forward into the tub.<p>
  She rose up out  of the water and wiped it out of her eyes to find herself face to nipple with a  full breast.  Her gaze rose to meet the  violet eyes of a very worried Amazon.<p>
  “Shan Pu?”<p>
  “Please not be  angry.  Great Grandmother say must do to  cure Ranma of cat fear, and learn more about Ai Ren!”<p>
  Kasumi blinked,  noting the sudden absence of China.  “Oh my.”   She wrung out her hair as she stood.   “Did she curse you just to do this?”<p>
  “No.  Shan Pu be cursed many years now.  Since thirteen.”  She frowned.   “Musk who attack village.  Shan Pu  meet before.  Make fall in spring.  Part why cousin hate so much.”  She sighed.   “Is why so upset when find Ranma fear cat.  Do not want Ai Ren run from Shan Pu.  Run from Shan Pu enough already.” she  finished sadly.<p>
  Kasumi wrung out  her skirt as she nodded.  “I understand,  dear.  But are you sure this is the <em>best</em> way?”  She finally gave up wringing the water out  and began undressing.  Nothing in the  groceries would spoil, and she’d been intending to get a bath before dinner  anyway.  “Akane is really happy with  having a pet.  I don’t know how she’ll  take finding out it’s you.  She’s not  always the most rational or forgiving person.”   Hanging her wet clothes from a nearby hook in the washing area, she  settled into the water across from Shan Pu.   “I mean, I know I told you that you need to work on being subtle, but  not outright deception.”<p>
  Shan Pu hung her  head.  “Great Grandmother say must need  learn more about Ai Ren.  She say be pet  for while so be close to Ai Ren, not be pushed away like have been.  Learn how make Akane and Ranma love like Shan  Pu love.  Learn how win heart.”  <p>
  Kasumi  sighed.  “I’m sorry she’s like that, Shan  Pu.  But you were a little bit of a surprise  for all of us.” she paused, reflecting, “Then again, so was Ranma.  Father neglected to tell us about him until  he was on our doorstep.”  She sighed  again.  “Plus, there’s the fact my last  advice led to the pair of you destroying the dojo.”  She laid her head back against the tub.  “Oh dear.   I don’t know, Shan Pu.  Your  grandmother could be right.  I guess for  now I will keep your secret.  But please,  don’t do anything to abuse Akane’s trust while you’re a cat.”<p>
  Shan Pu  nodded.   “Shan Pu try very hard.  Not even  sleep in Akane bed.  Sleep under so not  even hear words she say in sleep.”<p>
  Kasumi smiled at  her.  “Very well.  I will keep quiet and help if I can.  Just be careful.”<p>
  The Amazon  nodded enthusiastically.  “Shan Pu try  very hard,” she said again.<p>
  Kasumi  smiled.  “Good.”  A sudden thought hit her.  “Oh my… were you listening to Akane and I  talking yesterday?”<p>
  Shan Pu colored  as she hung her head.  “Shan Pu in  basket.  Could not help but hear.”<p>
  Kasumi  frowned.  “You <em>really</em> should try to avoid that in the future, dear.  It’s not polite to eavesdrop.  Still I suppose it can’t be helped.”<p>
  Shan Pu shook  her head.  “Shan Pu not do on purpose,  but did listen to Ai Ren.  Why Akane no  wish have babies?  Is not proper way show  love for husband?”<p>
  Kasumi sighed.  “I suppose for your village, that is the way,  but we have changed here in Japan.  We don’t have to have lots of children in the  hopes that a few will survive.  Father is  unusual in that he has the three of us.   One or two children is more common these days.  And Akane wants to be more than just a  mother.”  Kasumi leaned back as she let  the warm water soak into her bones.  “Our  mother used to be a martial artist, and was well on her way to being one of the  best.  When she met Father, they fought  like cats and dogs, but she could never defeat him.”<p>
  Shan Pu nodded  “Is best way.  Strong man insure strong  children.”<p>
  Kasumi  smiled.  “I suppose that’s true.  Anyway, eventually Mother fell in love, and I  was conceived.  That was the last bit of  scandal my mother allowed my father to engage in.  They were wed and I was born… and Mother had  to give up being a martial artist to take care of me.”<p>
  Shan Pu  blinked.  “Why?”<p>
  “Because taking  care of me and Father was too demanding to allow her the same kind of time and  dedication to martial arts she had previously.    And she insisted on stability for the family.  She insisted that she and Father could not  live as wanderers anymore.  Father  returned home and took over the school from Grandfather, and Mother learned how  to be a mother from grandmother.  By the  time our grandparents died, Nabiki had been born, and mother had settled into  being a housewife.  She still practiced  in the mornings with Father, but I always got the sense she’d felt like she  lost something.”  Kasumi traced circles  on the top of the water as she stared off into the distance.  “I tried as hard as I could to help around  the house, and take the burden off of her, but I never understood until later  what it was that she missed.  I never  realized how much she had given up until she died, and I was helping to raise  Akane.  She is so much like Mother at  times it’s scary.  Father always used to  brag that he had tamed a shrew in Mother, and Akane’s drive and temper came  from her.”<p>
  Shan Pu giggled  as she rubbed the back of her head.   “Shan Pu have felt Akane’s anger.   Is not worried.  Shan Pu proud  Akane is such strong warrior.  But being  mother does not mean is not warrior.”<p>
  “Do the women of  your village share the responsibility for raising children?”  Kasumi asked.<p>
  Shan Pu  nodded.  “Men mainly do housework and  watch over young ones, but all village help.”<p>
  Kasumi  nodded.  “In Japan, only the family helps, and <em>men</em> are generally off earning money to  support the family.  The school was  Fathers’ job, but when Mother died, he just kind of fell apart.  If it hadn’t been for the money Mother had  put back, and Nabiki’s gift for managing it, we would have lost our home years  ago.”<p>
  Shan Pu gave her  a horrified look.  Finally she blinked  and shook her head.  “Japanese very  strange.  Understand now why Akane not  want children right away.”<p>
  Kasumi  nodded.  “We don’t have the same ways as  your village, Shan Pu.  And it is hard  for a woman in Japan  with children to be anything but a housewife.   It’s what’s expected.”<p>
  Shan Pu nodded.  “Is same for men in village.  Not think Ranma be good househusband.”<p>
  Kasumi  giggled.  “No, I can’t see Ranma in that  role.”<p>
  Shan Pu  nodded.  “Shan Pu will think on  this.  She want make many babies for  family, but things not like at village.   May be best to wait.  Akane want  us three be family first.  Shan Pu  devoutly wish for this as well.  When  Shan Pu, Akane and Ranma <em>all</em> decide is time, then Shan Pu give many  babies.”<p>
  Kasumi gave her  a warm smile.  “That sounds like a very  wise plan, Shan-chan.”<p>
  Shan Pu blinked,  then smiled.  “Shan-chan.  Will need get used to, but like.  Very happy Kasumi will be sister as well.”<p>
  Kasumi  laughed.  “I’m hearing that from a lot of  people these days.”</p>

<p>The warehouse  was old and rickety, like the dock.  Tao-Ching  looked it over and grinned.  According to  his source, Herb’s boat would be here by dusk.  <p>
  The Prince had  done a good job of seeking unobtrusive entry to Japan, having hired a private  luxury yacht last night to take him across to Tokyo.   His only mistake had been paying in gold.   The yacht’s captain had no choice but to try  and fence the metals, since had he tried to sell it under normal channels, the  PRC would have been sniffing around trying to find out how he had come across  such a large cache of antique coinage.   Attempting to avoid the PRC had forced the captain to contact a Japanese  “merchant”, whose connections reported directly to Tokyo.   As a “favor” to Tao-Ching, the yacht crew had been replaced while Herb  slept and he had boarded it this morning unaware that the crew was under orders  to bring him directly to this old, disused Hibiki warehouse in Chiba.   Further arrangements had been made to ensure the docks were empty for a  half mile around.  Five million American  dollars could buy a lot with the Yakuza.   Twenty million all told, if you took into account hiring the mercenaries  of Area 88 to blow up the Musk fortress.   Almost his entire profits for the last six months.<p>
  Tao-Ching felt  the scar along his side and smiled.  A  small price to pay for revenge.  Mint and  Lime had already paid with their lives for his humiliation at their hands.  They should have made sure he was dead.  This time, he wouldn’t give Herb a chance to  use his fancy chi techniques and throw him over a cliff.  That had cost Shan Pu a lifetime cursed to be  a cat and him six months healing from being impaled on a bamboo pole.  Herb had a lot to answer for…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“I can’t believe  you asked her to introduce you to VENUS!”   Ayeka screamed, causing Kyoko to wince.<p>
  Ai looked at her  coolly, leaning back in the hot tub she’d arranged to have installed in the  cheerleaders dressing room.  She  stretched her arms out along the side, lifting her breasts to just above the  waterline as she got comfortable.  She  gave the raven haired cheerleader a slow examination, making the naked girl  feel like her skin was being flayed, and Ayeka resisted the urge to cover  herself.  Finally, Ai spoke.<p>
  “Yes,” Ai said  icily. “We talked about the Senshi.  I  needed information on exactly how involved with them she is.  The last thing I want is to beat her down  only to have to fight five super powered magical girls.  It’s called intelligence gathering.”  Ai shook her head at Ayeka’s failure to see  the obvious.  She should have avoided  mentioning asking for Sailor Venus’ autograph.<p>
  “It looked more  like flirting!”  Ayeka said, crossing her  arms under her breasts as she cocked one hip in annoyance.  “And most of the school thinks so too!”<p>
  Ai sighed,  wishing Ayeka’s eagerness to be her pet wasn’t part of a massive inferiority  complex that made the girl a great submissive, but incredibly insecure.  “Enough Ayeka.  Attractive as Zhu Shu is, until this matter  of challenge is settled, she’s off limits.”<p>
  Ayeka wouldn’t  be mollified.  “Attractive!  What does that little Chinese bitch have that  I don’t!” she screamed, lifting her arms and turning to display her lithe  figure.  <p>
  Ai shook her  head.  Telling the girl to shave had been  a mistake.  Nice as she looked bare,  Ayeka had obviously taken it as an attempt on Ai’s part to make her substitute  for Zhu Shu.  It hadn’t been.  She’d just discovered she liked the look, and  had made Ayeka her first experiment, trying to decide if she was going to have  the entire squad shave.  In the tall  girl’s mind, it had been far more significant.<p>
  “She does have  bigger breasts.” Kyoko added helpfully from where she was busy massaging Kaede’s  legs.  The redheaded girl was watching  the fight with an air of “enough already”, supporting herself on her arms as  she lay on the massage table, her legs spread to let Kyoko rub muscles sore  from practice.  She looked down at the other  girl’s comment and rolled her eyes with an amused smile.<p>
  Ayeka glared at  the chestnut-haired girl, her hands rising into a strangulation grip as she  almost advanced on the kawaii brunette.  <p>
  Ai waved her  off.  “I said <em>enough!</em>  Seriously Ayeka,  you’re acting like you’re <em>jealous.</em>  You’ve never raised a fuss like this over  anyone else I was looking at as a play toy.   You’ve been just as eager to play with them as I was.”<p>
  Megumi looked  over from where she was filing her nails on the other side of the hot tub.  “No one else you’ve played with could fight  us to a draw.” she said, matter of factly.   She examined her perfect nails and dropped the file on the side of the  tub as she stretched out, her toes casually finding a soft and furry  target.  “Akane doesn’t count because you  weren’t ever interested in her.  She’s  always been too much of a tomboy for you.   You like your women feminine, and your guys masculine.” she finished,  her toe stroking up and down gently.  Ai  spread her legs slightly but didn’t react otherwise.<p>
  “She certainly  isn’t acting that way as much since Zhu Shu started living with the  Tendos.”  Kyoko added.  “She’s nowhere near as violent.”  She sighed.   “Which makes Kuno give her googly eyes worse than ever.”  She stopped rubbing Kaede’s thigh as she frowned.<p>
  Kaede looked  down at Kyoko over the mute evidence that she was no more a natural red-head  than Ai was blonde, and rolled her eyes.   “Why you care that Kuno chases her is beyond me.”<p>
  Kyoko gave a  pretty little pout.  “Well, I <em>don’t</em> really.  I used to, but then I met Ai.”  She gazed at the oblivious blonde  adoringly.  “But he’s only done that  since he came to Furinkan.  He always  used to chase <em>me</em> when we were in junior  high and I sort of miss it.  It was fun  making him run around in circles.”<p>
  “And I remember  him being just as obnoxious about it.”  Kaede  shook her head.  “And you playing hard to  get just made him worse.  Now he assumes  every girl is doing it.  It’s one thing  to be chased for being desirable, but that boy is like a dog who can’t tell  who’s in heat and tries to hump everyone.”   She fluttered her eyes at the brunette and looked down  meaningfully.  Kyoko blushed as she  started rubbing again<p>
  Ayeka  growled.  “And all of that is beside the  point!”  She turned to Ai.  “When are we going to challenge that bitch  again!”<p>
  “When I can find  some way to cancel out those ki attacks!”   Ai exclaimed.  “As good as we are,  none of us know any ki based attacks that sophisticated.  We need some way to counteract those.”  Ai rubbed her temples, tired of the  argument.  She laid her head back against  the tub’s soft side as she felt Megumi’s toe begin making small circles.<p>
  “We could always  insult Ayeka until she explodes.”  Kaede suggested,  to a glare from the dark haired girl that the red-head ignored.   “It worked against your sister’s school.”<p>
  “Mariko’s squad  got cocky.  She needed to be reminded who  the real master of combat cheerleading was in the Konjou family.”  Ai said with a frown.  She reached down to tap Kaede’s foot  away.  “And Ayeka is uncontrollable when  she’s berserk.  It’s like she wants to  rip people’s throats out with her teeth and drink their blood.” Ai said as she  rose from the tub and began drying off.<p>
  The dark haired  girl glared at all of them, her eyes flashing red as the faintest hint of an  orange aura shimmering around her.  “Keep  it up and you’ll find out just how uncontrollable I am!”<p>
  “Calm down  Ayeka.  We <em>will</em> redeem ourselves against Zhu Shu.  As soon as <em>I</em> feel we are ready.” Ai said as she picked up her bra and started  dressing.  “You all did well in practice  today.  I just need to figure out how to  even things up in our favor, and we’ll teach the entire school who’s still the  best.”<p>
  The rest of the  squad nodded, except for Ayeka, who fumed still.  “I won’t wait forever Ai!”<p>
  Ai fixed her  with an icy glare that dissipated Ayeka’s aura.   “You will wait until I say or I will do something far worse than punish  you.”  She made very sure Ayeka met her  eyes.  “I’ll stop.”<p>
  The cowed girl  nodded as Ai turned and left, her yellow skirt flaring as she stalked out of  the room.  Kaede’s eyes followed her  before turning back to Ayeka.  “Stop  pouting.  Ai’s never let us down  yet.  She’s right.  You’re acting like you’re jealous.  Ai’s had plenty of other girls and guys and  you’ve never acted like this.”  She  looked down at Kyoko and smiled, shifting her hips.<p>
  Ayeka looked at  her.  “Why shouldn’t I be jealous, you  damn succubus?  That fucking dragon has  all the guys in school drooling over her, and half the girls!  And ever since she’s come, Ai’s barely even  looked at me!”  She looked down at  herself, running a hand along her flat stomach and over her freshly shaved  pubis, then sighing as she sat on the edge of the tub.<p>
  “Zhu Shu’s not  even interested in any of them, Ayeka.   Haven’t you realized she’s barely noticed anyone other than Akane or  Ranma?” Kaede said.  “I don’t think you  need worry about Ai ditching <em>us</em> for  the little tramp.”  She lay back on the  table, her hands behind her head as she hooked one foot behind Kyoko and pulled  her closer, smiling as the brunette knelt.<p>
  “Besides,” Megumi  added, coming up beside the tall raven-haired girl and rising out of the tub to  press against Ayeka’s back, her pale skin cool despite the water’s heat.  Her arms encircled Ayeka’s neck as she  nuzzled the raven haired girl’s neck then murmured in her ear “We all know how  obsessive she gets over anyone challenging her martial arts prowess.  Or any other prowess she has.  She’ll figure out how to counter those ki  attacks, and then, perhaps, we’ll turn Zhu Shu into our personal pet.”  Megumi’s finger traced lazily down Ayeka’s  breast bone.  “Once she’s been broken in,  she’ll make a fine addition to the squad, just like you were, Ayeka.  Just like we <em>all </em>were.”<p>
  “Exactly.”  Kaede added.   “Think about how much fun that will be.    Just like it was breaking in Kyoko here.” She reached down to stroke the  curly chestnut hair of the other girl.<p>
  Kyoko nodded,  too polite to speak with her mouth full.   The motion caused Kaede to gasp as her back arched and she moaned  softly.<p>
  Megumi watched  for a few seconds before concentrating on Ayeka.  “Just watch,” She purred in Ayeka’s ear as  she held out her wrist before Ayeka.  “Ai  will find some way to handle Zhu Shu. ”<p>
  Ayeka nodded, her  finger tracing along the throbbing vein in the blonde’s wrist before she gently  cupped Megumi’s arm in her hands…   “Alright, but if that wench makes a move on our Ai, I’m gonna kill her.”  She lowered her mouth and bit gently as Megumi  moaned in pleasure.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma looked  around the dojo, then down at her watch.   “Okay, so where are the girls?”<p>
  Akane shrugged,  the motion making her rabbit ears sway.   “I don’t know.  Zhu Shu said they  were going to come by and to give them their lessons this week.  I don’t know where they are.”  Her ears twitched towards the house.  “Hang on, Kasumi’s calling.”<p>
  Ranma blinked,  not having heard a thing.  “Okay.”<p>
  Akane was back a  few minutes later.  “Kasumi said Mrs.  Tsukino called to let us know the girls apparently went to Hong Kong with her  husband. He had to cover a story on a festival or something and they went as  part of a school cultural project.”  Her  frown showed annoyance.<p>
  “Oh, man.  Zhu Shu’s gonna kill em.”  Ranma shook her head. <p>
  Akane stepped up  behind her and picked up Ranma’s long braid, idly playing with it.  “Especially after she made them swear they’d  stay here until she had a chance to scout it out.”<p>
  “Oh, I take it  you heard the girls went to Hong Kong?”<p>
  They both turned  to see Luna coming into the dojo.  Ranma let  out a yelp and backed up to the far side of the dojo in one leap, Akane  fortunately having let go of her braid.   “She talked!” the terrified red-head squeaked.<p>
  Luna gave Ranma  a curious look.  “Usagi said you knew  about the Senshi.”<p>
  Akane  laughed.  “Ranma does.  We forgot to tell him you talk though, and he  has a phobia of cats.”<p>
  Luna gave Ranma  a curious look.  “Oh.  I’ll be quick then.  Sorry I’m late.  It’s ever such a long walk on foot.  The girls tricked us and took off.  We don’t know what’s going on, but they’re  okay so far as we’ve been monitoring.  I  just came to let you know that we felt a major surge of Silver Millennium  energy a few days ago, when you went to China.  Artemis and I are sure it came from Zhu Shu.”<p>
  Akane  nodded.  “We were attacked at the Amazon  village.”  She pointed to her rabbit  ears.  “These are a remnant.”<p>
  “Oh my.  I thought they were a headband.  Usagi has a pair just like those.”<p>
  “Well, these are  real.  Zhu Shu saved the village.  Shan Pu said that she had run to Jusenkyo for  water from the spring of drowned girl to turn everyone back from being  bunnies.”  She turned to show the fluffy  pink and white tuft poking out the top of her pants.  “We’re no longer rabbits, but as you can see,  there are still some issues.  I was in  the village square when Zhu Shu got back, and she just appeared on the dais in  a small explosion of light.”<p>
  Luna  blinked.  “Oh?  Interesting.   It takes all five of the girls joining powers to teleport.”<p>
  “She collapsed  afterwards, exhausted.” Akane said.  “The  elders say she overused her chi severely.”<p>
  Luna  nodded.  “Well, I just wanted to let you  know what was going on.  Artemis is  waiting outside and it’s a long walk back.”<p>
  “Why’s he  outside?”<p>
  “Said he smelled  a strange cat.”<p>
  “Oh, that’s China.  She’s mine.   Shan Pu gave her to me.”<p>
  Luna looked over  at the still cowering Ranma.  “And he’s  afraid of cats?”<p>
  “We’re hoping  repeat exposure will help him overcome the phobia.”<p>
  “Ah.  Well, I suppose that’s all to the good.  Anything I can do to help?”<p>
  “Don’t really  know.  Right now I guess not.”<p>
  “Well, at least  now we know why he had a fit the first day I came with Usagi.”  She tilted her head at the unmoving  girl.  “Good luck with the phobia,  Ranma!”<p>
  “Gah!”  was the red-head’s response.<p>
  Akane sauntered  over to the smaller girl as Luna nosed back out the dojo door.  “Well, it looks like we’re stuck with no  class to train.  Care to spar?”<p>
  Ranma’s eyes  stayed glued to the door until Luna’s tail disappeared, then let out a  sigh.  “Dammit, I did it again!”<p>
  Akane tugged the  smaller girl away from the wall and rubbed her shoulders.  “It’s going to take time Ranma.  You did very well.  Especially considering that we didn’t warn  you about her speaking.”<p>
  “I hate  this.  I used to like cats!”<p>
  “Give it  time.  No-one but you expects results  overnight.”  She stepped back and gave  the red-head a mischievous look as she untied her gi top.  “Now, are you going to spar with me, or not?”<p>
  Ranma watched as  Akane removed her gi, admiring the curves her body was developing, and smiling  as Akane’s bunny tail came fully into view.   Akane noticed her watching and gave her rear a shake.  “So, do I have a nice tail?”<p>
  Ranma gulped  hard.  “Umm…”<p>
  Akane laughed as  she reached behind her back and pulled her swords.  Ranma barely had time to blink as she blurred  towards her, Akane’s long braid whipping into a loud crack as she moved.  She stopped behind Ranma, her breasts pressed  against the red-head’s back and her arms encircling the other girl, swords once  more put away.  Ranma turned her head to  give the grinning girl a raised eyebrow.  <p>
  “What was that  about?” she asked, prompting Akane to giggle.<p>
  Then, Ranma’s gi  fell off, the garment sliced neatly into pieces.   <p>
  “I wanted you  naked.” Akane explained with a quirked eyebrow.  <p>
  Ranma gave her  the evil eye.  “You could have asked.”<p>
  “It’s more fun  this way.”  Akane smiled.  “Besides, it gives me a chance to let my  hands wander.” she added as her hands began to do just that, one hand moving  up, the other down.<p>
  Ranma blushed.  “Um, are you feeling okay?  I mean, Kodachi wasn’t even in school today,  so I don’t think she slipped you something.”  <p>
  “I’m horny.  It’s a natural thing for most people,  Ranma.  Especially people in love.”  Akane murmured as her fingers began playing  with Ranma’s curls.  “I’ve been horny  since we left China,  and this is the first time I’ve been able to express it.”<p>
  Ranma gasped as  Akane’s fingers found their target.  “Ah,  okay.  It’s just your usually so- so-“<p>
  “Sexless?” Akane  teased.  “I thought I broke you of that  idea.”  She tossed her head so her braid  wrapped around them both, pulling Ranma closer.<p>
  “Ah… yeah… um…  well… I…   just never expected you to be so forward.”  She leaned back against Akane as the dark  haired girl’s fingers began provoking the responses Akane sought.<p>
  “So? I want to  make out like bunnies.  I…”  Akane stopped and blinked.  “Oh my god.” she said, her lips right next to  Ranma’s ears.  “That’s <em>exactly</em> what I want to do.”  Her ears twitched.  “I’ve wanted to drag you off and play with  you ever since I got cursed.”<p>
  The red-head  blinked.  “Huh?”<p>
  “Since I got  cursed, whenever I’m not doing something, I’ve been daydreaming about having  sex.  With you, with Shan Pu, even Zhu  Shu.  Gods, I’ve been fantasizing about  just about everyone,” She nuzzled Ranma’s ear.   “And getting hornier and hornier.”<p>
  Ranma  blinked.  “Everyone?”<p>
  Akane pulled her  head back and gave the red-head a sour look.   “Get <em>over</em> yourself.  Like you haven’t done it too.  I <em>have</em> noticed your tendency to let your eyes wonder towards pretty girls.”<p>
  Ranma  blushed.  “Okay, okay.”<p>
  “Besides, the  only people I’d actually <em>do</em> something  with are you, and eventually Shan Pu.”   She leaned back in to start nuzzling again.  “I love you, and I never meant to hurt you.”<p>
  Ranma  smiled.  “I know.  I’m sorry.   Just have a hard time accepting that you really find <em>me</em> desirable.”<p>
  Akane blinked.  She leaned forward to look at Ranma’s face.   “Jeez.  I should have known the  overbearing ego had a hidden insecurity problem.”<p>
  “Hey, I ain’t  insecure!” Ranma protested<p>
  Akane  giggled.  “Of course you are.  When it comes to me anyway.  I think it’s cute.”  She hugged Ranma tighter for a second, then  her hands resumed their explorations again.   “Anyway, I wonder if being a bunny girl has side effects, like an increased  sex drive.”<p>
  Ranma sighed  softly as Akane’s fingers slid deeper.   “Umm… I dunno.  Maybe.  I ain’t complaining.”<p>
  Akane nipped him  lightly on the neck.  “Of course  not.  You’re the one being  molested.”  She grabbed Ranma’s hand with  her unoccupied one and guided it.  “A  fact that I expect you to correct immediately.”<p>
  Ranma smiled as  her fingers complied.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki growled  as she closed the cell phone.  Tao-Ching  still wasn’t answering.  And after she’d  gone and spent so much effort buying clothes!<p>
  She looked down  at the pair of stiletto heeled platforms she had bought, and sighed.  All dressed up and no place to go.  Stepping in front of the mirror, she examined  the deep v front dress she’d bought, the neckline plunging down so far that  she’d had to shave, and the lower hem barely hiding the fact she’d dispensed  with underwear too.  The back of the  dress actually plunged below her tail, leaving the soft brown puff of fur  fluffed out behind her.   The black heels  accented the ensemble, the open toes showing off her candy apple red nail  polish, and the extra two inches of height from the platforms and the seven  inch heels would have brought her almost level with Tao-Ching.  The daringness of the outfit had left her  feeling incredibly sexy.<p>
  A shame Tao-Ching  couldn’t see it.  She lifted the dress to  look at the small tuft of fur she’d left as a teaser and pouted.  She’d so looked forward to driving the  furball crazy with tantalizing glimpses until he couldn’t take it anymore, then  letting him take the dress off of her for a little fun.<p>
  She sighed again  and headed down to the kitchen to tell Kasumi she wasn’t going out after  all.  Pausing at the kitchen door, Nabiki  blinked, then gave a slow smile.<p>
  “Umm… Kasumi?”<p>
  Kasumi smiled at  Nabiki.  “Yes?”<p>
  “Um… you <em>did </em>realize you weren’t wearing anything  but that apron, right?”  Nabiki took  advantage of the fact to admire Kasumi’s excellent curves.<p>
  Kasumi blushed  prettily, but didn’t seem too bothered by Nabiki’s appraising looks.  “Oh my.   I was… well… I took a break for a few minutes.  If you must know, I was fantasizing and  didn’t want to mess up my clothes.  I was  so caught up in my daydream I didn’t notice I hadn’t gotten re-dressed.”  She took in Nabiki’s clothes.  “That’s a new look for you.”<p>
  Nabiki thought  about it, looking down at herself.   “You’re right.”  She looked  around.  “Good thing Genma and Sandal  aren’t here.  I’m practically giving a  free show, too.”  She shrugged.  “Though they’d probably run for the hills in  terror if they were.  The Ice Princess on  the prowl.”<p>
  Kasumi laughed,  the motions making her breasts bounce rather enticingly.  Nabiki licked her lips, feeling a sudden urge  to nibble.<p>
  “Mr. Saotome is  currently rather… occupied, with Mrs. Saotome.” Kasumi confessed.  “She actually dragged Mr. Saotome into his  room.”  Kasumi nodded out at the  dojo.  “And if I’m interpreting the  noises coming from over there correctly, I believe Akane is entertaining  herself with Ranma-chan.”<p>
  “Ranma-chan?”  Nabiki grinned.  “How cute.   I can’t wait to call him that.”<p>
  “Her.  We really need to treat Ranma as a girl when  he’s female.  After all she’s not going  to get rid of the curse any more than we are.” Kasumi said brightly.  She played with one of her ears, pulling it  down to toy with idly.  “We’re bunny  girls for life.”<p>
  Nabiki  nodded.  Then did a double take.  “Hey, wait a minute.”<p>
  Kasumi  nodded.  “You didn’t realize being a  bunny girl was throwing your sex drive into high gear.”  She smiled.   “Yes.  I noticed that  earlier.  I was going to warn you before  you went out.”  She looked down at  herself and gave Nabiki an amused grin.   “And as you can see I got distracted.”<p>
  Nabiki  laughed.  “So I see.  Nice to see you’re normal in that regard  too.”<p>
  Kasumi blushed  again.  “Well, I <em>am</em> human, Nabiki.  I’m just  not usually so… <em>blatant </em>about  it.”  She turned to finish draining the  sink from washing, her pale brown tail accenting her pear shaped rear.<p>
  Nabiki licked  her lips absently thinking about how nice a closer inspection would be.  She shifted her hips.  “Well, hopefully, if Tao-Ching isn’t home, he  got some lead on where Herb is so we can get this damn lock broken.”<p>
  Kasumi nodded as  she wiped her hands on the apron.  “Well,  I should definitely get dressed before anyone comes in.”<p>
  Nabiki gave her  a evil grin.  “Want some ‘help’?”<p>
  Kasumi raised an  eyebrow.  “Nabiki!”<p>
  Nabiki  shrugged.  “Hey, I’m incredibly horny,”  she admitted unapologetically.  “And <em>you</em> were the one to kiss Zhu Shu.  And is currently running around naked!  Can <em>I</em> help it if the entire Tendo family has the trait of being at least <em>curious </em>about lesbianism?” She stepped  into the kitchen with a teasing whirl, showing the dress off in full.  “Just watching you at the moment has made me  want to lay you back on the table and have you for a snack.”<p>
  Kasumi wrung her  hands.  “Oh my.  I can’t say I’m not tempted,” she admitted,  unable to hide the signs of that temptation behind her thin apron.  “But I know it’s just the effects of being a  bunny girl.  Besides we’re sisters.”<p>
  Nabiki  laughed.  “Don’t give me that.  I heard you talking to Akane about geisha  stuff.”  She stepped up to Kasumi and  backed her against the counter.  “Did it  ever occur to you that I might be interested too?” she asked, reaching around  Kasumi to grab the ties to her apron and pulling them loose as she stepped  back, drawing the apron up to reveal Kasumi’s curly locks, as impeccably  trimmed as always.<p>
  “But Nabiki,  Akane and I aren’t doing any thing like what you’re suggesting.” Kasumi  protested, gently tugging her apron out of Nabiki’s hands.<p>
  Nabiki laughed  and hiked her skirt to reveal what she wasn’t wearing underneath.  “Does this tell you how horny I am?”<p>
  Kasumi blushed  prettily.  “Yes, but we’d probably regret  it later.”<p>
  “Now you’re  rationalizing.”  Nabiki sing-songed.  She continued pulling the dress off and  tossed it on the table as she sat down on it with her legs spread.  “Now, I wanted Tao-Ching tonight, but he’s  not available, nor has he actually even asked me to be his girlfriend yet, or  out on a date, and I am getting rather tired of waiting.”  She casually traced down the joint of her  thigh, drawing Kasumi’s eyes to her mostly shaven state as she smiled  languidly.  “And in retrospect, he’s not  as safe to play with as you are.  Akane  is playing with Ranma, and even <em>Genma</em> is getting some.”  She batted her eyes  playfully at her sister.  “Now I <em>could</em> just go and find some random  individual to play with, I suppose.  But  then I’d never be absolutely sure they wouldn’t use this little weakness I’ve  acquired to blackmail me, and there’s always the possibility I’d get pregnant…”<p>
  Kasumi’s apron  sailed past her sister’s head as she smiled indulgently.  “You’re terrible.  I just want you to know that.” she said as  she turned and sashayed out of the kitchen.<p>
  Nabiki just  smiled as she sauntered out after Kasumi.   “Of course I am, but you love me anyway.”<p>
  “True… but that  doesn’t mean I’m going to say yes.”<p>
  “You haven’t  said no either.”  Nabiki said as they  headed up the stairs<p>
  Kasumi just  laughed.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>China watched the two girls disappearing up the stairs and  laughed internally.  She really hadn’t  meant to spy, having just come down to beg some milk from Kasumi and catching  the show between Nabiki and her sister.   She didn’t think Kasumi was actually going to give in to Nabiki,  considering she’d seen the mischievous look in the older girl’s eye as she’d  taken off her apron, but she wasn’t sure why the older girl was being so  resistant.  Must be another of those  weird notions these Japanese had.<p>
  It was amusing  watching some of the antics her Japanese sisters went through about something  as simple as sex.  Sex was a natural  expression of love, whether it was between sisters or mates.  Amazons kept it simple.  Sex for fun was fine between fertility  periods; procreation was reserved for marriage.   Sex with a sister was always for fun, regardless of whether they were  blood or not.  Really, how else was  anyone to learn the proper ways to stimulate a partner without practice?  She’d been surprised that all Zhu Shu’s  training had been rote memorization, and that she had never been trained to  read her body’s own signs of when she was fertile, though she had been trained  in herbal techniques to control conception.   She’d remedied at least that much during their two months hunting Ranma,  teaching Zhu Shu how to note the various signs of the feminine cycle.<p>
  Still, judging  from the little exchange between Kasumi and Nabiki, and Akane’s concerns about  playing with Ranma as a male, it looked like she would need to educate her new  sisters and Ai Ren as well.  Some of  these outlander customs were just too silly. <p>
  She nosed the  refrigerator door open and stood on her hindquarters to reach the bowl of milk  Kasumi had promised her she’d leave and drank.   Thirst satisfied, she returned to contemplating, realizing she also  needed to let Kasumi know about the lecture her great-grandmother had given her  about avoiding being in her cursed form as she approached her fertile phase, as  the animals instinct’s could become strong enough to overcome her rationality.  The Tendo girls were unprepared for anything  like this, and were locked in cursed form.   And, like most women who shared living spaces, their periods were  probably fairly close to each other.   This increase in their sexual appetites was probably going to get worse  as their periods drew closer, though hopefully, being only <em>half</em> rabbit would mitigate it somewhat.  She’d learned the hard way exactly how  overpowering that instinct was in the animal form, and was glad Ke Lun had been  nearby with hot water.  As it was, she  still had a problem with attracting felines when she was on her cycle, even in  human form, and went to great lengths to avoid cold water those three days.<p>
  Luckily, that  had just passed, and she had most of a month left.  Ke Lun would be in Japan long before then and she’d be  able to just avoid being China  during the danger period.<p>
  She wandered  over to the dojo and climbed up to the sill of one of the high windows, her  sharp ears and nose having caught the evidence of loveplay within.  She arranged herself on the ledge, watching  as her two beloved fiancées played with each other, wishing she could join  in.  Comforting herself with the hope  she’d learn enough about Akane and Ranma to win their hearts, she laid her head  down on her paws to study what her fiancées seemed to enjoy most, for future  reference.  </p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In another part  of Tokyo, Ai  was rummaging through the dusty shelves of a curio shop, indulging in her  secret vice, antique jewelry.  She had  quite a collection of rings and brooches, and one could never tell when one  might find something nice in a little shop like this.  She had sighted the shop when she’d been on  her way home from school, and grumbling about her squad complaining and the way  Ayeka had been bitching about her talking to the Chinese girl instead of  fighting her.  If it hadn’t been for the  fact that Ayeka really was such a <em>good</em> sub…<p>
  She sighed.  The problem was, she did want to beat Zhu  Shu, but she wanted to do it more to save face for the cheerleading squad than  out of pure animosity.  As aggravating as  losing to her had been, she had to admit that Zhu Shu had fought fairly, and  had been graceful enough to call it a draw, when she could have possibly  won.  Zhu Shu had been tired, but Ai  hadn’t been certain the metamorphosing girl hadn’t had another trick to pull  out of her bag, and with the rest of her squad down, Ai had lost a lot of the  mobility she counted on in a fight.  She  still had to be defeated, but Ai couldn’t make herself hate Zhu Shu like she did  most of her rivals.  And it wasn’t because  she was attracted to the Chinese girl, regardless of what Ayeka thought.  Beyond making her a pet, Ai had absolutely no  romantic interest.  Not in Zhu Shu anyway…<p>
  She had to find  away to soundly beat Zhu Shu, to humiliate her like the squad had been, so that  there was no question of who the ruling beauties of Furinkan were in the mind  of the students, while still leaving a means for her to talk the Chinese girl  into introducing her to Sailor Venus!   Then she’d be able to tell the incredibly lovely blonde Senshi how much  she worshipped her from afar… and Sailor Venus would…<p>
  “Humm.  I sense a spirit searching for answers.”  A voice said from next to her, disrupting her  fantasy.  Ai turned to see the shop  keeper, a wizened old man of indeterminate race.  “You seek to best a rival?”<p>
  Ai nodded.  “How did you know?”<p>
  The old man  laughed.  “You get to be my age dearie,  it’s a lot of been there, done that.   You’re looking, but not at what your hands are touching.  Deep in thought.”<p>
  Ai raised her  eyebrow.  “Yeah, so?”<p>
  “I might have  something that can help.”  He waved at  the back of the store.  “Come, let me  show you my real stock, not this useless trash I keep out here for the common  herd.<p>
  Curious, Ai  moved in the direction indicated.  The  old man took her to a small room behind a curtain, and turned on the lights.  Ai stopped and blinked.<p>
  The walls were  filled with shelves containing a vast array of knick knacks ranging from  grotesque to indescribably lovely.   Rings, mirrors, daggers, shrunken heads, and other less identifiable  items, crowded the various displays, and the very air felt strange, like it was  filled with static electricity just below the level of lightning.<p>
  The old man  crackled.  “Here, my dear, you will find  a means for what you seek.”  <p>
  Ai looked at the  disarray.  “In here?  How?”<p>
  “Magic.  I have charms for all sorts of things.”<p>
  Ai blinked, then  grinned.  “That would be rather  appropriate.  My ‘rival’ uses magic.  She turns into a dragon girl.”<p>
  “A dragon, you  say?”  The shopkeeper chuckled.  “I’ve always appreciated a fine piece of  tail, though I prefer kitsune myself.”<p>
  Ai sniffed.  “What am I, a side of beef?”<p>
  “Not at all. Not  at all.” the shop keeper chuckled.  “But  I never molest customers, however much I might want to.  Bad for business.”<p>
  Ai nodded,  mollified.  “So what do you have that can  help me beat her, without actually permanently hurting her?”<p>
  The old man  rummaged the shelves for a few moments before emerging with a flask.  “This.   Dragons are very magical.  This is  the juice of a rare berry that affects only dragons.  It will disrupt her magic, and cause it to  fluctuate wildly.  She will be unable to  use her powers for a time.  But be aware,  its effect is short term.  A matter of  fifteen to twenty minutes, then she will experience a surge that she will not  be able to control.  Then it will leave  her weak and intoxicated.”<p>
  Ai raised an  eyebrow.  “I see.  Will it harm her?”<p>
  “No more than  you drinking an entire bottle of sake, sweet cheeks.  It’ll leave her with a huge hangover.  It’s not called Dragon Wine for nothing.”<p>
  Ai’s eyes  glittered.  “That will be perfect.  Imagine her trying to fight me drunk.”<p>
  “Make sure you  give it to her in her true form.  It  won’t work otherwise.  If she’s human  when you give it to her there will be no effect.”<p>
  Ai nodded.  “That can be arranged.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Tao-Ching  watched as the yacht pulled up at a slow pace and a lone figure jumped to the  dock.  His eyes narrowed as the yacht  bounced off the pier and veered off into the night.  He studied the figure on the dock.  <p>
  The figure  turned.  “You may as well show yourself,  assassin.  I can sense your  presence.  You do not wish to anger me,  as your friends aboard yon boat found out.”<p>
  Tao-Ching didn’t  move from the shadows.  “Saves me some  money paying them then.  Long time no  see, Herb.”<p>
  The cloaked  figure turned more fully.  “Your voice is  familiar, assassin.”<p>
  “Yours is a bit  higher pitched.  Mint’s words make sense  now, ‘princess’.”<p>
  The figure  lashed out, a line of explosions crossing the dock to shatter the crate Tao-Ching  had been behind, but he’d already moved.   His last encounter with Herb had taught him the value of not being seen  until he was ready to strike.<p>
  “You are quick,  assassin, but you cannot hide forever.  I <em>will</em> kill you.” Herb said.<p>
  “You make a lot  of threats, Herb.  Last time you swore  you’d douse me in Nannichuan and lock me as a woman for your amusement.  I see the worm has turned.”<p>
  The figure  reached up and lowered its hood, revealing Herb’s face.  Tao-Ching blinked.  Other than Herb’s hair coloring, she could  have been a twin of Zhu Shu’s cursed form.   Herb finished drawing off the cloak, revealing the dragon scale armor  she had always favored.<p>
  “Yes, I do  indeed find myself in an unpleasant situation, Tao-Ching.  But I am still more than a match for an orphan  castoff that the Amazons took pity on.”<p>
  “I have found my  family name, Herb.  But it seems you have  lost yours.  You were a fool to join with  the Scorpion.”<p>
  Herb turned  further, her eyes probing the darkness trying to find Tao-Ching’s hiding  place.  “The Scorpion have their  uses.  When I have retrieved the <em>Kaisufuu</em>, I will dispense with them.”<p>
  “It’s much too  late for that Herb.  They have already  dispensed with the Musk.  I slew Lime not  four days ago when he dared to assault the Amazons.  Mint died two days after, sacrificed by your  ally to keep us from questioning him.   You are the last, Herb.  When I  kill you, the Musk will be gone.”<p>
  Herb lashed out  again, destroying a large pile of crates.   “You will pay for this murder, Tao-Ching.”<p>
  Tao-Ching laughed  from another shadow.  “Murder?  You dare accuse <em>me</em> of murder?  Your assault  left twenty Amazon warriors dead, and half the rest of the village cursed.  Ripping out Lime’s throat with my teeth has  barely even begun to repay the debts you owe, Herb.”<p>
  Herb lifted off  the dock as the air swirled around her.   “So, have you brought more Amazons to their deaths in a futile attempt  to best me?  Even as a woman, I am far  your better!”  The wind lashed out,  destroying all the crates between the dock and the warehouse wall.<p>
  The warehouse  groaned as the explosion shattered the wall as well, leaving a huge cloud of  dust.  The wind grabbed it and blew it  away, leaving Herb a clear view of the devastation, but no sign of Tao-Ching.<p>
  “Your fortress  looked a lot like that as it slid down the mountain.” Tao-Ching’s voice mocked  from the depths of the warehouse.  “It  was very pretty how it fell apart.”<p>
  Herb began to  glow.  “I will slay you and every single  Amazon who ever drew breath for this outrage Tao-Ching!”  The glowing wind tore the warehouse apart.<p>
  “I’ve heard your  threats before, Herb.  Like your attacks,  they’re full of flash and fury, but you keep missing the target.”<p>
  “Coward!  Face me!”   Herb screamed.  “Fight me like a  man!”<p>
  There was the  sound of a metallic click.  “I see you’ve  misunderstood the situation Herb.  This  isn’t a <em>fight</em>…”<p>
  A red pinprick  of light touched Herb’s temple and she started to turn as Tao-Ching  continued.  <p>
  <em>“…It’s an execution.</em>”<p>
  Tao-Ching’s  finger tightened on the trigger of the AK-47, and the first three round burst  of steel-jacketed armor-piercing rounds left the muzzle of the machine gun,  propelled by high velocity charges.   Blood sprayed from Herb’s temple as she was twisted around in the air,  and the object she had clutched so tightly in her hand flew away to clatter  across the dock.  A second round of  bullets flew, striking Herb in the shoulder.   The glowing wind around her flickered out as the bullet’s impact threw  the dragon princess through the air like a rag doll.  She crashed into the waters of the bay and  floated face down, blood staining the water around her before she slid beneath  the waters of the bay, pulled under by the weight of her armor.  <p>
  Tao-Ching stood  on the dock, grimly watching as Herb sank, waiting nearly ten minutes as fins  circled the red water before lowering the weapon and putting the safety back  on.  Finally sure Herb wasn’t going to  re-surface, he walked over to the object Herb had dropped, picking up the  narrow bucket and fishing the ladle out from under the boards it had wedged  into.  He held up the bucket and laid the  ladle across the handle like Lo Shen had advised him, and smiled as a beam of  light shone off into the darkness.  With  a smile, he took the bucket to his Humvee.   With a guide like this, there was no way he’d get lost!  He’d have the <em>Kaisufuu</em> back to the Tendos before morning!</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>As the lights of  the Humvee faded into the night, silence reigned across the devastation.  Hours passed before finally the scavengers  came out.  Dark shapes combed the  wreckage pulling out whatever valuables could be found, before scurrying into  the darkness again.  One of the  scavengers looked up as a faint noise came to his ears.  He motioned to one of the others and they  moved off in the direction of the noise.   After several minutes of searching, they found the source. <p>
  Under the dock,  tossed carelessly by the tide, was a naked girl.  Blood was clotted from a bruised cut on her  temple, a long line that creased her skull just above her ear.  Another obvious bullet wound pieced her left  shoulder blade, the wound far cleaner than any the men had ever seen.    She was pale from blood loss, and  unconscious, but didn’t seem to be in danger of dying immediately.  The first scavenger grinned.  “Well.   This is a pretty happenstance.”<p>
  The other  nodded.  “Indeed.  He’ll pay nicely for a beauty like this.”<p>
  “Truly.  But we certainly can’t deliver her untested  can we?” The first said as he used his foot to roll the girl over and spread  her legs to reveal her virginity.<p>
  “Absolutely  not.” the second grinned nastily.  “Let  me get the rope.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Several days  passed without word from Tao-Ching, and Nabiki was starting to get worried. <p>
  And even  hornier.  Despite teasing her, Kasumi had  so far been unbeddable, and she was getting enormously frustrated.  She’d tried everything she could think of,  including outright begging, and all her older sister had promised her so far  was that if she was still that interested once the curse was unlocked, she <em>might</em> consider it.  Nabiki had been amazed by the iron will her  sister hid under that calm, smiling exterior.   She knew Kasumi was feeling the same effects of being a bunny girl that  Nabiki was, and was good naturedly putting up with them far better than either  of her sisters… or even Nodoka.  Both of  the Saotome men had been wandering around in a happy daze half the time, and  even though she knew Akane was making sure that Ranma was female when they were  playing, the fact that her younger sister, who had finally discovered sex, was  out doing Nabiki annoyed her.  So far,  she’d managed to maintain a modicum of control at school, though it took almost  every ounce of willpower she had, but it kept getting worse.  Tao-Ching needed to show up before she lost  total control of herself!<p>
  It had become obvious  that Kasumi’s theory about her animal instincts getting worse as she came  closer and closer to her period was correct, but it didn’t make it easier to  deal with.  She still had a few days to  go before her period, and the drive to mate was getting unbearable.  It was rare that anyone perked her interest  enough for her to feel attracted to anything but their wallet, and she wasn’t  used to having her mind wander constantly back to sex.  It was getting harder and harder not to look  at everyone around her as a potential partner.   Her reputation as an Ice Queen was already in peril with Tao-Ching  chasing her, but if he didn’t get back soon, she’d end up with a reputation as  a slut worse than Ai!<p>
  Of course if she  seduced Ai…<p>
  She sighed.  Maybe if she told Kasumi she was  contemplating such drastic measures, Kasumi would relent and give her a little  relief.  It was far more than frustrating  hearing Akane and Ranma in the next room, and even with the fiber optic camera  she’d drilled through the wall, she just wasn’t satisfying herself.  She couldn’t figure out how her older sister  was managing to deal with it so well.   Kasumi had specifically avoided Doctor Tofu, and Ryouga hadn’t been around,  and while she might have suspected Zhu Shu was helping… Zhu Shu wasn’t back  from Hong Kong, or Nabiki would have long since dragged her into a bed.  And it wasn’t that Kasumi wasn’t feeling it  too.  Being a bunny girl had heightened  more than just Nabiki’s hearing, and some smells were impossible to hide from  her nose.  She knew she was getting  Kasumi aroused, sometimes very highly, but her elder sister would just smile,  tease her back a little, then gently worm her way out of the situation without  giving in.  That one concession from Kasumi  was the farthest she’d gotten so far!   And if it weren’t for the fact that Akane had Ranma…<p>
  Ooooooh, when  she got this curse unlocked, she was going to seduce Kasumi just on  principle!!!  It was totally unfair that  she was being left here as horny as a rabbit in heat while both her sisters  were finding ways to satisfy their own urges!<p>
  The thought was  broken off before it could lead into the inevitable fantasy that would have  followed by the sound of a vehicle pulling up outside.  Nabiki ran downstairs and threw open the door  to see a weary, battered, and bruised Tao-Ching coming up the short walk from  an equally bruised and battered Humvee.   She paid no attention to the muck as she threw herself on top of him,  actually knocking the solid man down despite his larger mass.<p>
  “<em>WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?</em>”  Nabiki yelled.  “Oh, never mind where you’ve been!”  She grabbed him by the collar, straddling his  lap as she half lifted him from the ground.   “Are you ever going to actually ask me out officially?”  She drew his face close to look into his  eyes.  “Are you going to be my  boyfriend?”  She shook him.  “And if the answer’s yes, <em>DO YOU HAVE A CONDOM?”</em><p>
  Tao-Ching  blinked, and calmly smiled, unaffected by the shaking.  “Nice to see you too, Nabi-chan.”<p>
  “<em>DON’T CALL ME NABI-CHAN!</em>  You have left me here for days with a  rabbit’s sex-drive!  <em>DON’T GRIN LIKE THAT!”</em><p>
  Tao-Ching gave  her a long looking over, taking in the extremely short skirt and top she was  wearing, as well as the evidence she wasn’t wearing anything under them.  Nabiki felt the reaction under her and knew  he liked the look.  Finally, he held up  an old brass kettle.  “Will <em>this</em> help?”<p>
  Nabiki looked at  the kettle and blinked.  “Is… is that  it?”<p>
  Tao-Ching tipped  the kettle over and a stream of hot water poured on Nabiki.  Instantly, she felt a twist as her rabbit  ears and tail vanished.<p>
  Along with the  overwhelming urge to… well… you know.<p>
  Nabiki sighed in  relief.  “Gods.  Thank you.   You have no idea how maddening being a bunny girl is.”  She released his collar and sat back,  realizing the change hadn’t apparently dimmed her appeal to Tao-Ching.<p>
  He shifted his  hips under her.  “I turn into a smilodon,  Nabiki.  I do have <em>some</em> idea.  I can smell a  feline in heat for miles.”<p>
  A cleared throat  caught their attentions and they both looked to the house.  Soun was standing there with his arms  crossed, Kasumi peeking over his shoulder.   Soun was giving them a hard look, and Nabiki slowly realized what he was  looking at so sternly.<p>
  In the process  of knocking Tao-Ching over, Nabiki’s really short skirt had ridden up even  further, and the fact that she was sans undergarment was extremely  obvious.  She blushed as Soun took out a  cigarette and lit it, taking a long drag.<p>
  Finally, he  spoke.  “Well, young man.  I think I need to ask what your intentions  are towards my daughter, since it seems she’s made her intentions towards <em>you</em> rather clear.”<p>
  Nabiki rolled  off Tao-Ching and pulled her skirt down.   “Umm.”<p>
  Tao-Ching waved  her to silence as he stood and bowed.   “My intentions are the same as they have been since I first met her,  Soun-sama.  I intend to woo her and win  her heart, and eventually to win her hand.”<p>
  Nabiki blinked  at him in shock.<p>
  “I see.”  Soun said, taking another long drag on his  cigarette.  “Very well, I approve the  engagement.  It’s a suitable one for  Nabiki, as you come from a fine family, and Akane has accepted her familial  duties to the School.”  He took  Tao-Ching’s hand and pumped it.  “Welcome  to the family, son.”<p>
  Nabiki’s stared  at her father in even more shock.  They  were deciding on this <em>FOR</em> her? “Hey...  But... What...” she sputtered.<p>
  Tao-Ching  grinned.  “You’ve been waiting to do that  since I got you drunk to tell you about Shan Pu, haven’t you.”<p>
  Soun puffed his  cigarette, not saying a word.<p>
  “<em>DADDY!!!!!</em>”  Nabiki yelled.  Soun gave her a calm glance.<p>
  “Yes, daughter?”<p>
  “You can’t just  engage me like this!”<p>
  Akane poked her  head around the door.  “Why not?  It’s what happened to me.”<p>
  “But, but,  but...” <p>
  “Nabiki, you  asked him if he had a condom, and you were sitting on top of him, giving every  indication you wanted to indulge in certain activities that should only occur  between a wedded, or at the very least, an <em>engaged </em>couple.  That certainly tells me you  wanted to marry him.”  Soun tossed the  stump of his cigarette into an empty flowerpot, earning a sigh from  Kasumi.  “Now, I try to be a modern and  liberal father, Nabiki, but there are proprieties that <em>must</em> be observed.  At least  I’m now certain that one of my daughters will be in something approaching a  normal relationship.  Now kiss him for  pity’s sake and drag him upstairs.  I’m  not getting any younger, you know.”<p>
  Nabiki raised  her eyes to heaven.  “Am I the only one  in this family who’s sane?”  <p>
  “So far, I  haven’t seen anyone who matches that description.” another voice broke in.  <p>
  Tao-Ching  straightened like he’d been shot.<p>
  The rest of the  group looked over at the woman who was casually leaned against the Humvee,  dressed in a simple Amazon style tunic and breeches.  She was fairly tall, and whip thin, with long  hair tied into a crest that rose above her head, and fell almost to her feet in  a cascade that shifted through various shades of magenta.  She was holding a long shaft topped by a  massive blade, kind of like a naginata, but the sword blade was almost eighteen  inches wide and nearly four feet long, making the over all weapon nearly ten  feet in length.  Nabiki hazily recalled  seeing one in a museum and the name she recalled was guan dao. Despite its  size, the woman carried it like it weighed nothing.  <p>
  Tao-Ching turned  slowly.<p>
  “Mother?”  he whispered.<p>
  The woman  smiled, her soft expression a warm contrast to the obvious shock and dread on  Tao-Ching’s face.  “Long time no see,  Son.  I hear you’ve been a bad boy.  Lo Shen sent me to collect you, and the <em>Kaisufuu</em>.” she said lightly.<p>
  “Oh shit.”  Tao-Ching groaned.<p>
  The woman moved  in a blur, bopping Tao-Ching on the head with her guan dao.  “What did I teach you about cursing!” she  asked, the amused lilt still in her voice.<p>
  Tao-Ching rubbed  his skull.  “Alright, okay.  I’m sorry.   I went after the <em>Kaisufuu</em> alone because I wanted to get it for Nabiki and her family.  I was afraid if I told Lo Shen first, she’d  demand I bring the <em>Chisuitton</em> back to  the village and that would take forever.   I’ve seen the elders work, Mother.   They’d have debated for days on who would need to be sent to retrieve  this.”  He shook the kettle.<p>
  “That was not  for you to decide, Son.  I have been sent  to bring you back to the Council.  Don’t  make me have to tie you up and spank you.”<p>
  Nabiki decided  the most disturbing thing about the woman was the air of ineffable good cheer,  like she would smile as she was cutting your head off.<p>
  “Alright.  I submit, mother.  You know I can’t beat you.” Tao-Ching raised  his hands in surrender. “I don’t even have my sword on me.”<p>
  “It is good that  you submit, my son, but foolish of you to wander around weaponless. But we  shall speak of that later.”  She turned  to look at Nabiki.  “So, my son has  chosen you as a mate?”  She stepped  around the younger girl, looking her up and down.  Nabiki got the impression that the woman was  highly amused by the short skirt and halter top.  “Well, she has a nice body, but she’s not a  warrior is she?”<p>
  Nabiki let out a  “Hey!” in protest as Tao-Ching smiled.   “Actually, she is Mother.  A  warrior of the mind and intellect.  In  our first battle, she bested me in fair combat, mind to mind.  Rather easily I might add.”<p>
  “So what’s this  business about engagement?  You should  have begged her to be your wife already.”<p>
  Nabiki  gulped.  “Oh my.  You mean those rules apply to the men too?”<p>
  Tao-Ching  smiled.  “Yes, but you didn’t know, and I  wasn’t about to try and force them on you, regardless.”  he turned back to the Amazon.  “This is Japan, mother.  I can’t apply all the Amazon laws to modern  life.”<p>
  The Amazon  raised her eyebrow, the dark violet blending into her pinkish lavender  hair.  “Since when, son?”<p>
  Tao-Ching  sighed.  “Since I’m a legal citizen of Japan.  I don’t have the diplomatic immunity you  have.  Bribes only go so far.  I can’t just insist Nabiki marry me because  she beat me in a deal.  And besides, I  want her to have a chance to make her own fortune, so she won’t feel like I’m  richer than she is anymore.”<p>
  Nabiki blinked  at him while the Amazon nodded approvingly.   “At least you haven’t succumbed to these foolish outlander notions of  female inferiority.  I’d have had to beat  you senseless.”<p>
  “Mother!”  Tao-Ching rolled his eyes.  “I may not be living in the Amazon village  these days but I haven’t lost my senses.”<p>
  She ignored him  as she stepped around to face Soun.  “So,  you are the father of my new daughter-in-law?    I am Rin Se, daughter of Lat Her.   Mother to this mannerless lout.”<p>
  Soun  blinked.  “Um… Pleased to meet you.”<p>
  “Is Tao-Ching in  trouble?”  Kasumi asked.  “He did get the kettle, after all.”<p>
  Rin Se  shrugged.  “I don’t know.  Lo Shen was hopping mad when she ordered me  to retrieve my son.  He’s always been  trouble ever since I found him.  Makes me  wonder sometimes why I adopted him.” She gave Tao-Ching a fond smile.<p>
  “Because you  could never be bothered with any of the Amazon men, mother, only the women.  It was either adoption or nothing.”  Tao-Ching said with an air of something said  a million times.<p>
  “Paugh,  weaklings all.  I brought Tao-Ching up to  be a real man, almost the equal of a woman.   Not a shy retiring man like most males.”   Rin Se said dismissively, patting Tao-Ching on the head proudly.<p>
  “Well, that  explains most of the arrogance.”  Akane  muttered. <p>
  Nabiki poured  water from the kettle over her head, far more than was necessary to unlock her  curse.  “You’re one to speak.”<p>
  Akane glared at  her as she moved on to Kasumi.  A few  seconds later all the Tendo girls were back to normal.  Kasumi took the kettle back to the kitchen to  fill a bottle with the water to unlock Nodoka and for emergency purposes before  returning the kettle to the Amazon.<p>
  “Is Tao-Ching  going to be punished for bringing this to us first?”  Nabiki asked finally.<p>
  Rin Se gave  Tao-Ching a mock stern glance. “I don’t know.   I suspect that to gain the <em>Chisuitton</em> he had to kill Herb…”<p>
  Tao-Ching  shrugged.  “He deserved death.  The Warleader was going to kill him anyway.”<p>
  “This, as my son  is not an accomplished enough fighter to meet him in a fair fight, means he has  likely acted dishonorably and ambushed the Prince.”  For the first time, Rin Se’s smile turned  into a small frown<p>
  “Princess.”  Tao-Ching noted.<p>
  “Ah.  Still, you were ordered to report to Lo Shen  and instead took matters into your own hands.   None of the Elders have much tolerance for that.  I’m sorry, Son, but you brought this on  yourself.”  Rin Se shook her head.  <p>
  “Yes, Mother.”<p>
  “What will  happen to him?”  Nabiki asked worriedly,  visions of executions running around her head.<p>
  “The usual.  An impossible quest.  Righting some great wrong in repayment for  his transgression.  Slaying a demon.  Rescuing a princess.  Something no sane person would ever attempt,  or something no-one can succeed at doing.”   Rin Se shrugged.  “Still, he’s a  male.  They’ll go easier on him than they  would a Warrior.  Don’t worry  daughter-in-law.  They’ll leave enough of  him to make sure I have grandchildren.”<p>
  “Mother!”  Tao-Ching said exasperatedly.<p>
  “What?  Your mate’s father is correct.  We’re not getting any younger.”<p>
  Tao-Ching shook  his head.  Stepping up to Nabiki, he  reached out and took her hand, raising it to his lips.  “Don’t worry Nabi-chan.  I’ll be back.   If they were really all that mad, they’d have sent a whole troop instead  of just my mother.  Whatever punishment  they set, it was still worth it to repay Herb for the debt he owed Shan Pu for  her curse, and for nearly killing me.   And if they punish me for bringing you the <em>Kaisufuu</em> first, well that was worth it too, considering the  greeting I got.”<p>
  Nabiki  smiled.  “Don’t get used to that.  I wasn’t entirely myself.”  She blushed.   “I’m not a full time bunny girl anymore.”<p>
  “I’ll see about  that.”  Tao-Ching said with a grin.  “You’re way too cute with those ears.”<p>
  He turned back  to the Humvee to leave, only to have his mother push him towards the passenger  door.  “What, you think I trust <em>you</em> not to get us lost?  Lo Shen said with all haste.”<p>
  Tao-Ching rolled  his eyes before giving a “what can you do” shrug and climbing in the  Humvee.  Nabiki watched as they drove  off, hoping he wouldn’t be gone too long.<p>
  Then she did a  double take.<p>
  <em>Shan Pu’s curse?</em></p>
