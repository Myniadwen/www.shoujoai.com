<a href="../crossover/1honor-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Kiyone nervously adjusted her Major&#39;s insignia, then
reached down to tidy up her uniform. The black haired
young woman was still getting used to wearing the
Manticore uniform, designed so different from her old
Galaxy Police one, but she was adapting slowly but
surely. She left her quarters and went out into the
halls on the fleet drydock, floating high above
Manticore, where the latest designs of vessels were
being constructed and tested.

&quot;It&#39;s good to have you aboard, Kiyone,&quot; Washu looked
up from where she stood in the command center that
Kiyone had entered a few moments later, her lips
curling up in an honest smile of welcome.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Kiyone nodded, fighting the urge to salute.
Over the months that she had been with Manticore she
had learned a lot, including the odd way Ryouko
worked. Washu had no official rank, but she had her
lover Yume were probably Ryouko&#39;s closest advisors,
ministers in all but name.

Washu looked amused, &quot;Remember, just call me Washu.&quot;
She smirked as she drawled, &quot;Or little Washu, if you
like.&quot;

Kiyone just let that one go. &quot;Has there been any word
on Nagi?&quot; she asked seriously.

The amusement on Washu&#39;s face largely went away at
that point. &quot;No, not yet,&quot; she said intently, &quot;it&#39;s
been three weeks since she went to Jurai and not a
word.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Kiyone made a face.

Thinks had been rapidly going down hill with Jurai for
several months now, but this was a new low. Ryouko had
begun to expand the Manticore Empire against several
hostile neighbors, ultimately ending up on the edge of
Jurai space. She had planned to open up diplomatic
talks with Jurai at that point, but the Emperor had
not only refused to talk to them, he had ordered his
vessels to move against Manticore&#39;s forces.

Sending Nagi in as a diplomatic envoy was Ryouko&#39;s
last hope to resolve things semi-peacefully, but it
looked like it wasn&#39;t going too well. The border
between Jurai and Manticore was swiftly becoming a
battleline, with Admiral Harrington out there keeping
an eye on things along with the best of their fleet.

&quot;Minagi is having fits, as you can imagine,&quot; Washu
said grimly. She shook herself, &quot;The only good news is
that the diplomatic push with the nonaligned powers is
going well.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Kiyone said a bit wryly. If felt odd at
times, being in the position that she was in. Her
experience with the GP along with the amount of travel
she had done had swiftly lead to her becoming one of
Ryouko&#39;s inner circle, advising the Empress on many
diplomatic matters, and she was quickly rising in rank
in the fleet as well.

&quot;I know that you feel conflicted in all this,&quot; Washu
added quietly as the staff that ran the command center
hurried around them, &quot;but I think you know first hand
that the Galaxy Police aren&#39;t on the side of the
angels in all this.&quot;

&quot;Especially how blatantly the GP has chosen to climb
into bed with Jurai,&quot; Kiyone conceded, thinking of the
Galaxy Police presence on the Jurai side of the
battlelines, &quot;but I still have friends over there,
even if I think the organization itself stinks.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Washu nodded, the little redhead
smiling wryly. &quot;If it helps any the Science Academy
has come down publicly on Jurai&#39;s side,&quot; she added
seriously, &quot;putting Yume and myself in a similar
position to yours.&quot;

&quot;Not fun,&quot; Kiyone was about to say something more when
an officer spoke up.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Nicole spoke up, the pink haired new recruit
sitting at sensors, &quot;there&#39;s an unidentified hyper
signature out on the edge of the solar system.&quot; The
young man worked the controls with confidence, &quot;It&#39;s
civilian, not Jurai or Manticore.&quot;

&quot;Assuming they have military grade sensors, how long
until they get into range to scan the docks?&quot; Kiyone
ordered crisply.

&quot;If it&#39;s Jurai or Galaxy Police tech, probably half an
hour,&quot; Washu answered crisply. She looked up at
Kiyone, &quot;You think they&#39;re trying to see what we&#39;re
building out here?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve kept the Light Armored Craft and the Carriers
for them a secret up till now,&quot; Kiyone shrugged, &quot;I&#39;d
like to keep it a secret if we can.&quot; She narrowed her
eyes in thought, considering the situation, &quot;Why don&#39;t
we send a ship out to meet them, far enough away to
keep them from scanning us? We can always use the old
customs inspection excuse.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need my permission,&quot; Washu tossed her a
smile, &quot;but I agree with you.&quot;

Kiyone left a commander in charge as she left the
bridge, hurrying down the halls towards the docks. She
made herself ignore the view outside the armored
windows, though she was tempted to slow down to study
the ships that were in construction just outside.

The Manticore system drydock was one of the busiest in
the Empire and home to some of the most vital projects
under the protection of Home Fleet. The new LAC
Carriers were swiftly coming together, construction
crews hauling metal segments together to assemble the
massive, blocky craft. Along with standard shipboard
weapons each would carry a wing of eight LACs, the
nimble, very lethal craft a deadly surprise to any
enemy.

&#39;At least we&#39;re hoping to keep it a surprise,&#39; Kiyone
thought to herself as she reached the docks. Several
light cruisers were moored to the heavy dock, intended
for possible defense of the station as well as to
transport crew. She keyed the airlock and stepped into
zero gravity, sliding across the connection tube to
the waiting ship.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; the lieutenant saluted as she stepped onto
the deck, the dusky skinned young man looking a bit
nervous.

&quot;Let the bridge know I&#39;m coming Roger,&quot; Kiyone said
crisply as she strode by.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Roger saluted again before hitting the
internal communications system.

A few moments later and Kiyone stepped off the lift
onto the bridge, smiling slightly as she saw the crew
busily preparing to move out. The captain turned to
smile, the brown haired woman throwing a crisp salute,
&quot;Welcome aboard, Major Kiyone.&quot;

&quot;Captain Tita,&quot; Kiyone returned the young lady&#39;s
salute. A recent arrival to the Fleet Captain Tita had
started out as just a ocean going captain on a small
colony world before getting caught up in Manticore&#39;s
diplomatic efforts and an attempted murder. Once the
dust settled Tita and her crew were offered a chance
to join up, and after some debate they agreed.

&quot;Nicole over at Drydock passed us over the sensor
readings,&quot; Tita reported with a merry twinkle in her
eyes that showed that she really enjoyed her work,
&quot;we&#39;ve already got a least-time intercept plotted and
ready to go.&quot;

&quot;Well done,&quot; Kiyone murmured with a smile, &quot;let&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;Balboa,&quot; Tita turned to her tanned, blonde haired
executive officer, &quot;execute course, start us up at 200
gravities.&quot; She keyed the communicator for
engineering, &quot;Mikhail, we&#39;re on the move.&quot;

The gravely voice of the old engineer reminded Kiyone
of many engineers she had met, crusty men who were
more comfortable with their engines than with most
human beings. &quot;You&#39;ll have full power as needed,&quot;
Mikhail rumbled out, &quot;and the lazy yard crew had
completed the weapons upgrade as promised.&quot;

&quot;Weapons upgrade?&quot; Kiyone asked as the ship rumbled
just slightly, disconnecting from the station and
moving out into the blackness of space.

Tita smiled slightly, &quot;Washu&#39;s committed to bringing
cruisers up to par with larger ships in energy arms,
at least.&quot; The vessel accelerated through the void,
stars streaming by the viewport as they raced to the
intercept point.

&quot;Can we scan the vessel yet?&quot; Kiyone asked crisply.

Balboa was frowning slightly, &quot;It&#39;s a private boat,
but an older class of ship.&quot; He paused, &quot;Unarmed,
according to scans, but it carries a Galaxy Police
insignia.&quot;

Tita looked over to Kiyone as they slowed, the ship
coming to a halt a cautious distance away. &quot;Do you
want to hail them, or should I?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Considering the GP doesn&#39;t like me very much right
now,&quot; Kiyone answered her wryly, &quot;you probably should
do it.&quot;

&quot;Galaxy Police vessel,&quot; Tita said formally, &quot;this is
Captain Tita of the Manticoran cruiser Cha Cha Maru
II, please identify yourself and state your
intentions.&quot;

The view screen fuzzed with static, then the very
messy interior of the ship appeared. &quot;Oh, where&#39;s that
video feed,&quot; the familiar voice asked. The view
shifted a bit, then a cheerful looking blonde
appeared, her dusky skin oddly suiting her warm
expression.

&quot;Mihoshi?&quot; Kiyone blurted out in surprise.

Mihoshi beamed, pushing her blonde hair back from her
face. &quot;Kiyone, I&#39;ve been looking all over for you,&quot;
she said cheerfully.

&quot;Friend of yours?&quot; Tita had to ask, her voice tinged
with amusement.

Kiyone was sweatdroping, but she couldn&#39;t help the
smile that stretched her face. &quot;An old friend of
mine,&quot; she admitted. &quot;We&#39;d better let her dock,&quot; she
advised, &quot;and find out what&#39;s going on.&quot;

A few moment&#39;s later Kiyone and Tita were waiting by
the docking hatch, the larger vessel floating beside
the GP patrol boat. Tita looked up at her
thoughtfully, &quot;You know, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you
smile like that before, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Kiyone felt herself blush a bit, &quot;I have to admit,
I&#39;ve missed her.&quot;

There was a soft chime from the hatch, indicating that
the connection tube was pressurized and ready to go.
Tita activated the switch, the door opening up as she
continued, &quot;Well, as long as there&#39;s no problems, I
don&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;Kiyone!&quot;

&quot;Ooof!&quot; Kiyone hit the ground underneath the happy
blonde, the other woman having flung herself through
the hatch and right atop Kiyone. Kiyone felt her
cheeks going bright red as Mihoshi snuggled happily
then sighed, &quot;Hello, Mihoshi.&quot;</pre>
