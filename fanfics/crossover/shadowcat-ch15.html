<h1>Shadowcat: Read or Die! (part 15 of 21)</h1>

<a href="../crossover/shadowcat-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>The room was dark as the brown haired figure waited,
eyes closed and seemingly at peace with the world.
Black sheathed her from head to toe, black pants,
shirt, boots and gloves, even a mask covering her
face.

Without moving she softly ordered, &quot;Begin.&quot;

Nancy Mukahari, or at least a very good copy, raced
from the darkness, machine gun blazing, but the woman
disappeared. The purple haired woman looked around
wildly only to stiffen as the shuriken stabbed into
her body without warning. She scrambled to pull free
the blades but the poison was too powerful, her body
going sluggish then finally still.

Not waiting for a signal Gennai Hiraga raced forward,
the energy blade glowing in his hands. Black hair tied
back he moved gracefully, attacking without warning
but the lady was too fast for him. Stepping forward
unexpectedly she jabbed into his throat, blood
spraying even as the warrior dropped to the ground,
choking. A swift strike into his electrical backpack
then leaping away and the room was lit up with an
violent explosion.

A crash and the grasshopper tore through the wall, the
older man piloting it looking faintly amused. Insect
pincers snapped shut where she had been standing but
she rolled clear, tossing a wave of throwing blades
and shedding green blood onto the floor. Fabre cried
out angrily only to be cut off as a throwing star
plunged right into his eye. His body split like a
cocoon, a different form emerging but she was ready,
striking him down again and again.

Mr. Sinister emerged from the shadows, white skin
almost glowing in the darkness as he clapped his hands
softly. &quot;Are you satisfied?&quot; he asked curiously, eyes
glowing a faint red.

The woman pulled her mask off, her brown hair falling
around her shoulders as the clone of Katherine Pryde
smiled in unholy satisfaction. &quot;This shell may very
well do,&quot; the martial artist known as &#39;Ogun finally
said.

&quot;I do wish you hadn&#39;t had to kill the three clones,&quot;
Mr. Sinister frowned slightly, &quot;it takes so long to
grow new ones.&quot;

&quot;I needed a real test,&quot; &#39;Ogun replied, &quot;to be sure
what I could and couldn&#39;t do.&quot; She smiled coldly, &quot;And
I think I&#39;m ready for the task ahead of me.&quot;

Mr. Sinister smiled, but there was nothing at all
pleasant in the expression. &quot;To acquire the remaining
genetic information the Library holds,&quot; he purred,
&quot;and to kill Gentleman.&quot;

In another part of the city Kitty Pryde yawned
tiredly, stretching out on the lumpy couch as the
morning sun came in the windows of Yomiko Readman&#39;s
book strewn apartment. Last night had been a busy one,
shaking down informants from both Kitty and Drake&#39;s
contacts, but they hadn&#39;t made much more progress on
tracking the Ijin.

&quot;So you&#39;re still here?&quot; the faintly amused voice
asked.

Looking over the back of the couch Kitty saw Nenene
Sumerigawa quietly making her way through the piles of
books that nearly littered the room. She set down a
bag lunch with a post-it note on it reminding Yomiko
to eat, then smiled at Kitty wryly. The younger girl
had intelligence in those eyes, along with a bit of
understandable wariness.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; Kitty answered quietly, aware that
Yomiko was still sleeping. She got up, glad that the
oversized T-shirt she had on as a nightie covered
everything, and followed the girl out onto the roof.
It was a cloudy day, but still comfortable enough for
her to be partially undressed.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Nenene looked at her with a wry smile.
&quot;You&#39;re a morning person,&quot; she noted, &quot;unlike
Yomiko-sensei.&quot;

Kitty chuckled to herself softly in agreement. Yomiko
really didn&#39;t handle mornings very well, usually
needing several minutes just to get her brain working
properly, not to mention dealing with other people.
Staying here the past few days Kitty had quickly
learned just to leave Yomiko alone until she finished
waking up.

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Kitty conceded, &quot;though it looks like
you have that quality, too.&quot;

Nenene shook her head, &quot;Not exactly, I just make sure
to finish waking up before I come over here to
Yomiko&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Yomiko&#39;s a lucky woman to have someone like you
around to help take care of her,&quot; Kitty said honestly.

Nenene actually blushed faintly, looking out over the
city around them. &quot;And what do you think of Yomiko?&quot;
she asked softly.

Kitty felt her cheeks color faintly and had to fight
to control her emotions. &quot;I like her a lot,&quot; she
conceded, &quot;I think we could become good friends.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; Nenene gave her a scolding
look.

&#39;I didn&#39;t think that would work,&#39; Kitty thought wryly.
&quot;I&#39;m not in love with her, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re
asking,&quot; she said firmly.

&quot;Good,&quot; Nenene murmured.

&#39;But I could get there,&#39; Kitty added silently, &#39;very,
very easily.&#39;

&quot;Why do I seem to find you two out here all the time?&quot;
Yomiko asked. They turned around to see her blinking
at them owlishly, still looking half asleep. She
absent-mindedly clutched one of her many books in her
hand, oddly reminding Kitty of someone holding a teddy
bear.

&quot;Because we wanted to talk and were trying not to wake
you,&quot; Kitty said with a fond smile, wondering if
Yomiko realized how cute she looked in her rumpled
dress, bits of her hair standing up from how she had
slept.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Yomiko nodded, swaying slightly.

Nenene took charge almost automatically, stepping
forward to take Yomiko&#39;s arm. &quot;Come on Sensei,&quot; she
said as she led the older woman inside, &quot;let&#39;s get you
dressed.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Yomiko said with sleepy good-naturedness.

Kitty had to smile as she looked out over the
rooftops, trying not to indicate that she knew they
were being watched. The person was based on a rooftop
quite a few buildings away, and as far as Kitty could
tell they were professional, using the building&#39;s
structures to stay out of direct line of sight. If
there hadn&#39;t been a flash of light off glass, she
didn&#39;t think she would have spotted them.

&#39;So are they Ijin,&#39; Kitty wondered, &#39;or from one of
the intelligence agencies? Or even a representative of
the Library, keeping an eye on Yomiko and I?&#39;

&quot;Kitty-san,&quot; Nenene called out from inside a few
moments later, &quot;tea&#39;s on.&quot;

&quot;Coming,&quot; Kitty answered as she turned to walk inside,
making a mental note to tell the Library about the
surveillance, just in case.

Nenene had sat Yomiko sitting down on the book
cluttered bed, a cup of tea in front of her while a
similar cup waited for Kitty by the couch.
&quot;Kitty-san,&quot; a much more wakeful Yomiko beamed, &quot;did
you want to get changed?&quot;

&quot;Nah,&quot; Kitty sat on the couch, grabbing a pair of
hastily discarded pants and swiftly pulling them on.
&quot;So what&#39;s on the schedule for today?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I have a substitute teaching job scheduled,&quot; Yomiko
answered her apologetically, &quot;so I guess you&#39;re on
your own.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess I&#39;ll check in with our friends,&quot; Kitty
took a drink of her tea, &quot;and see if I ca find
something to read at the library.&quot;


Nenene gave Yomiko a fond look as she wryly remarked,
&quot;I hope you&#39;re not into books as much as sensei is.&quot;

Kitty had to smile, &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone is into
books as much as Yomiko is.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Yomiko protested cutely.

Out on the rooftops two figures watched the apartment,
using the shadows and the fixtures on the roof to
conceal their presence. Amelia frowned, brown hair
falling into her matching eyes as she said, &quot;I&#39;m
beginning to wonder if following them is a waste of
time.&quot;

Yukio-cat smiled, her black fur giving her a sleek
kind of beauty, &quot;Patience, I still think this is our
best chance to find the Library.&quot; She looked over at
Amelia thoughtfully, &quot;You seem somewhat more skittish,
today.&quot;

Amelia&#39;s face was grim as she sighed, &quot;You know what
&#39;Ogun has done?&quot;

Something flickered in Yukio-cat&#39;s eyes, a flash of
something like fear. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said coldly.

&quot;I know that we&#39;re just clones,&quot; Amelia said to her
seriously, &quot;and that we&#39;re disposable, but still...&quot;
The tall woman shook her head, &quot;Our fellows shouldn&#39;t
have to been slaughtered merely for &#39;Ogun&#39;s practice.&quot;

&quot;We serve as needed,&quot; Yukio said seriously. She looked
at Amelia curiously, &quot;And what do you think you could
do about it, anyway?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Amelia answered honestly, her pilot&#39;s
gear flapping gently in the breeze, &quot;but I&#39;m beginning
to think we should at least do something.&quot;</pre>
