&#147;WHY DIDN&#146;T I KILL HER?!?&#148;

&#147;Why didn&#146;t I just kill her?&#148; The giant cat was pacing in her room, 
irritated, her long sandy tail furiously lashing back and forth. &#147;It&#146;d 
been easy, she was at my entire mercy!&#148; In frustration, she flopped back 
on the bed. &#147;Everything was fine. I set up the brawl and the fall of the 
chandelier as a diversion, and it perfectly worked. She was completely 
defenseless when I approached her! I could have broken her neck anytime! 
No witness, clean work!&#148;

The giant golden cat kicked her boots off, lied down and crossed her 
arms behind its head. &#147;So why did I just stood there? What was I doing, 
flirting with her like that?&#148; Slitted blue eyes closed, the picture of a 
young ogress forming behind them. Her vivid imagination was set free 
ever since she had held the sweet ogress in her arms. They would live in 
her own castle, close to the sea. Michiru would stroke her while they 
would spend a quiet evening close to the fireplace. The ogress would 
cook them the fishes or mices she would catch for her. The cat was sure 
Michiru was a great cook. They would explore their territory together. 
They would share her king size basket. They would play with a wool ball 
together. They would clean each other...

She sighed. &#145;When I was close to her, all I could think about was her 
petting me behind my ears and scratching my tummy, and me, rubbing 
myself against her...&#148; The giant cat was startled by her own loud and 
steady purr.

Her eyes widened in disbelief. &#147;What the f...! I&#146;m not in heat or 
anything!&#148; Worse, since she had laid her eyes on the lovely ogress, she 
hadn&#146;t thought even once about all the pussy and even human women who 
were chasing her around. She usually quite enjoyed it, but now, 
everything seemed different. She jumped back on her feet and began to 
pace in the room again. &#147;What&#146;s happening? She must have bewitched me! 
Yes, it must be her secret power! Many ogres have a secret power, the 
last I killed could transform himself in any animal!&#148; She stopped 
abruptly, cupping her chin in one of her paws. &#147;I&#146;ll have to check this, 
if she really has a charm spell on her, it might make things quite 
difficult for me. It didn&#146;t seem to work with the humans in the inn, but 
it&#146;s maybe stronger on animals...&#148;

She thought a bit more about her problem, then, suddenly, a large smile 
split up her face. She put her boots and her hat back on, opened the 
window, jumped on the roof opposite to it and disappeared in the 
night...

--------------------------------------------------------------

Michiru felt rather frustrated. The provisions she had bought this 
morning wouldn&#146;t fit in the backpack Makoto had supplied her. She didn&#146;t 
understand why, it was huge and there was almost nothing inside. Only a 
few clothes and shoes (you never know what kind of weather you&#146;ll have, 
and what if you&#146;re invited to dance or something?), one or two make-up 
kits (absolutely necessary), soap and shampoo, a bottle or two of an 
enchanting perfume she had found in the market (she&#146;d have to come back, 
the market was really lovely), some tiny pieces of jewelry... Nothing, 
really! Finally, with a grunt, she shoved it inside and quickly strapped 
the lid before the content could explode outward. She then tied a covert 
and her violin case on top of it and turned to the others to find that 
Makoto and Ami were already ready to go with much more reasonable 
backpacks and that Donkey Pelt was quivering under the weight of her own 
one.

&#147;I&#146;m all set. You guys are sure you want to come with us? It could be 
dangerous!&#148;

&#147;No worries! I&#146;ve always dreamt to join a quest! My cousin Naru and her 
husband can take care of the inn for a while.&#148;

&#147;And since the villagers are so healthy, they certainly won&#146;t miss me.&#148; 
Ami sacarstically added.

Michiru smiled. &#147;Thank you.&#148; Her face became dreamy. &#147;I just wish I 
could have met the puss in boots from last night again...&#148;

&#147;You must have dreamt. Giant cats wearing boots don&#146;t exist...&#148; reasoned 
Donkey Pelt.

&#147;And even if it did, my inn is the only one miles around... Not to 
mention the best... It would have stopped here and taken a room. I 
couldn&#146;t have missed it.&#148; Added Makoto.

Ami seemed quite worried. &#147;I don&#146;t know...&#148; She said thoughtfully.

The other three looked at her expectantly.

The dwarf blushed when she caught the other staring at her. &#147;Back when I 
was still at the mine, I had heard rumors of a talking cat wearing 
boots. It was said to be the lord of a nearby country which it had 
received from its prince for its good service... I don&#146;t know much and I 
have no evidence of it, but they said that the cat was a master of 
trickery and an assassin. I&#146;ve heard it killed many people before it 
became lord, even a ogre...&#148; She looked back at Michiru worriedly. &#147;It 
has maybe be sent after you...&#148;

Michiru had a glazed expression on her face. Now that Ami had talked 
about it, she did remember this story. It had happened to one of her far 
cousins. At the time, nobody in the ogrean society had given credit to 
the tale. He was one of the most powerful ogres in the region. That a 
simple cat would be able to defeat him was simply unthinkable! Everyone 
had assumed that he had finally ran away with his mistress, a 
half-tuna/half-whale mermaid. However, if her savior was truly her 
cousin&#146;s assassin...

She shook her head. She could recall all too vividly the intoxicating 
warmth surrounding her when the giant cat was embracing her so 
protectively. &#145;I think it was a female...&#146; She thought absentmindedly. 
Her mind was more preoccupied by the lean muscles under the so soft, 
golden fur. And how she had sank in these two beautiful blue pools that 
were its eyes. She couldn&#146;t even stop herself blushing when she 
remembered how the vibrations of its purr made her feel... Hell, she had 
even heard the characteristic love-at-the-first-sight background music! 
If that wasn&#146;t indication enough, what was? Yes, she was definitely 
charmed this time...

No! If it was her cousin&#146;s murderer, she&#146;d have to avenge him! He was 
certainly not the most loveable ogre in the world, but he was still 
family! She couldn&#146;t allow herself to indulge in what was probably only 
a mere infatuation with a complete stranger!

Of course, if all of this was just a misunderstanding... Everything was 
possible... She wondered if its, or her, if the cat was indeed female, 
tongue was as raspy as any other cat&#146;s...

She snapped out of it when she finally realized that Donkey Pelt was 
loudly clapping her hands in front of her face. She blinked several 
time. &#147;Yes, Donkey Pelt? What do you want?&#148;

&#147;Geez, girl, you completely spaced out! I was about to ask Makoto to try 
and slap you awake! And why were you blushing so hard anyway?&#148;

Michiru was now so red that no one would have believed that she was an 
ogress. &#147;Err... It&#146;s getting late, shall we go? We&#146;ll still have a long 
way ahead of us and I&#146;d like to be back home by the end of the week!&#148; 
With that, she flung her backpack on her shoulder and hastily made her 
way to the door.

She had just stepped outside when a barrel full of stinking pieces of 
fishes fell on her.

She was in such a state of shock that she didn&#146;t react, even when Makoto 
gently took the barrel away. She was staring blankly straight ahead, her 
fist spasmodicaly clenching and unclenching themselves, muttering 
something unintelligible. She did react though, when she heard 
hysterical mewls coming from a street nearby. Lots of mewls. Lots, lots 
of mewls! Then she saw them. Hundreds of starved cats purposefully 
charging her, drool sliding down their chin. Their eyes clearly said 
that she was on their menu. Her feet didn&#146;t wait for her brain to 
process the information and hurried in the opposite direction.

(AN: Does anyone remember the music of the Benny Hill show, when Benny 
Hill was invariably purchased by a furious mob at the end of the show? 
No? Maybe I&#146;m already too old...) She ran through, around and even under 
the village several times, the cats in hot pursuit behind her, which in 
turn were followed by her three friends. She also created a few new 
doors and many villagers were surprised in their intimacy. Several 
chicken discovered that under certain circumstances they were indeed 
able to fly and enjoyed a long- wished freedom before being eaten by 
foxes. And even more dogs would need professional help for the rest of 
their life...

The cats eventually got tired of running after her and began to fight 
each other for the fish pieces she had lost in her flight. And so she 
was in the town center, panting heavily when Donkey Pelt and the others 
finally joined her. Unknown to them, a stylishly clothed feline figure 
had witnessed the whole ordeal from a roof. &#147;Hum, the test wasn&#146;t very 
concluding. Maybe I shoul...&#148;

BAM!!!

Something violently hit the puss in boots in the back, sending it 
crashing down the roof in the central place, close to our heroines&#146;s 
group.

Michiru, Donkey Pelt, Ami and Makoto quickly looked up when they heard 
the cry of pain and the impact of a golden and black figure a few meters 
away from them. The ogress&#146;s eyes widened when she recognised who it was 
and she ran to her, her friends on her heels. Her eyes watered when she 
saw that the giant cat was unconscious. Beside her, Ami was already at 
work.

&#147;What happened?&#148; She asked no one in particular.
