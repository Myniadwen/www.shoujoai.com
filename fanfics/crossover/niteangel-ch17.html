<a href="../crossover/niteangel-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>A HOTEL PENTHOUSE, ROANAPUR...

Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent laid on the bed, her burned-out eyes tightly 
bandaged, but it didn&#39;t ease her suffering much. Although unnecessary, 
the dusky vampire was panting heavily, the burning pain because of the 
infusion of holy water Natasha Radinov injected within her wracked her 
body. Occasionally, her body would tighten-up and convulse as a new, 
painful spasm would hit, Rally doing everything within her power to 
prevent from screaming. The one good news was that, at least the 
blotchiness on her skin had faded.

Standing over the ailing vampire, Rally&#39;s father, Deepak Vincent, used a 
scalpel to cut into his palm. &quot;Irene,&quot; he said firmly, holding the cut 
hand over her, &quot;open your mouth!&quot; Soon, a small stream of blood dripped 
into the vampire&#39;s open mouth, and then afterward Rally groped around 
for his hand, finally licking the wound when she found it.

Taking note that his wound had healed-up, Vincent gently caressed his 
daughter&#39;s cheek with his hand. &quot;Feel any better?&quot; he asked.

It took a while before Rally could answer. &quot;A little... thanks, Dad.&quot; 
Indeed she seemed to be more comfortable than before, her breathing 
easing up.

The surroundings the two were in just happened to be in one of the 
bedrooms of a very posh penthouse at the hotel they were staying in, 
Rally no longer in the sleazy room they were put-up in previously. 
Vincent then got up and said, &quot;Look, I&#39;ll leave you alone for a bit. If 
you need anything, don&#39;t be too afraid to shout out.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; But as Vincent made his way to the door, Rally asked, &quot;Dad?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Irene?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m a bit scared, not being able to see and all that.&quot;

Vincent could only look sympathetically at her. &quot;I know, Irene. You just 
rest now.&quot; He then walked out of the room.

As he made his way to the living room, the others inside the two-bedroom 
suite - Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, Balalaika, Moria 
Hedgley, Pip Bernadotte, William Collins, Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah, as 
well as Rock, Dutch, Benny and Revy, all looked at him. Only Seras 
Victoria, who was looking out the window, didn&#39;t turn around. &quot;So far, 
she&#39;s more comfortable than an hour ago. All we have to do is hope her 
regeneration abilities kick in soon.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Collins said. &quot;I&#39;m telling you, I&#39;ve never seen Rally so 
fucked-over in my life! How in the world did something like this happen 
to her, I thought vampires were immune to such things!&quot;

&quot;Well I have the culprit right here,&quot; the Hellsing leader said, holding 
up a small plastic bottle.

&quot;Hey be careful with that!&quot; Collins blurted, almost panicking. &quot;There 
could be acid in there!&quot;

Sir Integra just sighed. &quot;I appreciate your concern, Agent Collins, but 
Rally could not be harmed by acid at all... which this is not!&quot; She 
tossed the bottle to Collins. &quot;Go ahead... see what it is.&quot;

Looking doubtful, Collins opened the cap and sniffed the contents. When 
he found no noxious odors, he gingerly place a drop on the top of his 
hand. Feeling no pain, he took a taste. &quot;Hey wait of minute... this is 
just water!&quot; he said. &quot;Something like what happened to Rally couldn&#39;t be 
done with water!&quot;

&quot;True, if it was normal water, but this is HOLY water we&#39;re talking 
about,&quot; Sir Integra explained. &quot;True vampires are vulnerable to all 
forms of blessed implements.&quot;

Collins now took a new look at the bottle, realizing the depth of the 
meaning. &quot;So it&#39;s holy water then.&quot;

&quot;I have a bad feeling I know where Bloody Pierce had obtained a 
substantial quantity of holy water,&quot; Balalaika said, turning around to 
face the others. &quot;It&#39;s well-known she has a friend in Sister Yolanda of 
the Church of Violence. Clearly, she may have gotten it there.&quot;

Sir Integra nodded. &quot;Unfortunately, since that facility is also a Roman 
Catholic Church, there is no way the Hellsing Organization can confront 
them, not without the Iscariot Organization knowing about it and 
interfering.&quot;

&quot;Oh for crying out loud,&quot; Revy bellowed, bored with the talk, &quot;let&#39;s not 
concentrate on the Rip-Off Church right now! That bitch Natasha Radinov 
got that fucking chip and is possibly on her way off this shitty 
island!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d thank you to watch your language in Sir Integra&#39;s presence if I 
were you!&quot; Moria growled as she went to answer the door, for which the 
doorbell had sounded.

&quot;Screw you!&quot; Revy shot back at the maid. &quot;Who knows, maybe she&#39;s already 
out of the country by now!&quot;

&quot;Somehow I would find that highly doubtful, Rebecca,&quot; a new voice said. 
Everyone turned around to see three men, escorted by Moria, enter the 
apartment. All three were Chinese, but two of them were overly cautious, 
obviously guards of the third, a man who appeared to be in his late 40&#39;s 
to early 50&#39;s, who had hair that matched his black suit and wore dark 
sunglasses. &quot;If Radinov did, then I would&#39;ve heard about it. I have a 
sizeable watch at the bridge to the mainland, as well as the harbor. 
She&#39;ll find it very difficult to leave otherwise.&quot;

Balalaika turned to this newcomer and smiled. &quot;Ah, you&#39;ve finally come, 
Mr. Chang,&quot; she said. &quot;I see you have gotten my message about our guests 
from England. Well I for one am thankful you had taken the proper 
precautions.&quot;

&quot;The pleasure is mine, Balalaika,&quot; Chang replied. Then he turned his 
attention to Sir Integra, and smiled as well. &quot;So I finally get a chance 
to meet you, Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing. I must say, you&#39;re 
more than what I&#39;ve heard from in the past.&quot;

Sir Integra just glowered at the newcomer. &quot;Obviously you are a Triad 
leader,&quot; she said, eyeing him steelily. &quot;And just what do you mean by 
that observation?&quot; she said suspiciously. That comment caused Chang&#39;s 
men to take up defensive postures, hands reaching for concealed guns.

&quot;Take it easy guys, she isn&#39;t doing any harm,&quot; the Triad leader said 
calmly, causing his men to relax. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about the reception Sir 
Integra, but my men tend to be a bit on the paranoid side. As for your 
question, I think I better show you this first.&quot; Chang then reached 
inside his coat pocket and produced a picture. &quot;This was taken when I 
was about eight. It&#39;s of my father and his guest. It&#39;s a little faded, 
but I think this should clear things up a bit.&quot; He then handed it to the 
Hellsing leader, &quot;I&#39;m the one on the Chinese man&#39;s shoulders.&quot;

Still eyeing Chang suspiciously, Sir Integra looked at the photo he 
offered - and her eyes widened in shock! &quot;Father?&quot; she gasped. Indeed, 
the guest portrayed on the photo&#39;s image was that of Sir Arthur 
Hellsing, Sir Integra&#39;s father and previous head of the Hellsing 
Organization.

&quot;Now you see what I mean,&quot; Chang said. &quot;My father met yours over forty 
years ago in Hong Kong, when it was still a British colony. Granted, Sir 
Arthur didn&#39;t exactly approve of how Dad conducted his business; I did 
inherit it after all - but he was also appreciative that a person in his 
position DID have access to information about vampires and the like that 
wasn&#39;t available using legitimate channels! Dad even knew this and 
willingly helped Sir Arthur in protecting the colony. You could say that 
the Hong Kong office was, during my father&#39;s time, the Hellsing 
Organization&#39;s unofficial Southeast Asia branch.&quot;

&quot;So you say,&quot; Sir Integra mused, handing the photo back. She then looked 
up to Chang and asked, &quot;Is there any way of verifying the information 
you have disclosed?&quot;

&quot;If you wish, you can contact either Walter or Alucard,&quot; he offered. 
&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll confirm everything I&#39;ve told you.&quot;

Sir Integra took this information in and said, &quot;I might do just that, as 
well as informing them about Rally&#39;s condition.&quot;

&quot;I will also try to inform the police department here to be extra 
diligent in locating Bloody Pierce,&quot; Balalaika offer. &quot;I know Chief 
Watsup doesn&#39;t trust many of the criminal organizations here - but I 
will stress the crisis you are facing.&quot;

Sir Integra nodded, even though she had little faith than to trust a 
police department which was possibly under the thumb of criminals. &quot;Very 
well,&quot; she finally said, &quot;I will leave the details to locating Radinov 
to you two. Meanwhile, I will contact Walter in London to verify what 
Mr. Chang has disclosed.&quot; The two crimelords nodded and started their 
way out of the penthouse.

&quot;Miss Balalaika?&quot; Moira called out in perfect Russian.

The Russian woman turned, totally surprised at the maid&#39;s grasp of her 
native language, &quot;Da, Miss Hedgley?&quot;, repeating in the same.

&quot;I would also like to thank you for transferring us from those tawdry 
rooms to this lovely penthouse,&quot; the maid said, still talking in 
Russian.

&quot;Well it was the very least I could do, young lady,&quot; Balalaika said. &quot;In 
a way, it was partly my inattention to the situation going on here that 
you and your friends had gotten such sub-standard accommodations here.&quot;

Moria looked confused. &quot;I don&#39;t quite follow,&quot; she said.

&quot;Well, I had found out recently, through some quite reliable sources, 
that the now-former manager of this hotel had, for quite some time, had 
reserved an entire story of this hotel for the exclusive use of friends 
and family, all without paying. I had only discovered that fact when the 
incoming receipts of this hotel didn&#39;t quite match the occupancy rates,&quot; 
Balalaika explained.

&quot;I see. So what has happened to this manager?&quot; Moria asked.

&quot;I made sure his severance was quite adequate if you like to know. Now 
if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to be going.&quot; Balalaika then accompanied 
Chang and his bodyguards down the private access elevator.

Collins, as it happened, was listening in on this conversation, knowing 
Russian. Leaning over to Vincent, he mumbled in a low voice, &quot;Wanna bet 
that manager is somewhere on this island with a bullet in his head, 
Deepak?&quot;

&quot;I think you would win that bet, Bill,&quot; Vincent answered in an equal 
tone, having understanding the conversation.

THE STREETS OF ROANAPUR, A FEW MINUTES LATER...

&quot;I... don&#39;t think I quite follow, ma&#39;am?&quot; Chief Watsup said over his 
cellphone near his squad car.

&quot;I repeat, have your patrols doubled! It is imperative that Bloody 
Pierce must NOT leave this island!&quot; Balalaika&#39;s voice repeated over the 
other end. &quot;She has in her position a device that could cause great 
harm, not only to this island, but the very world if it were to get 
out!&quot;

&quot;But my resources are being stretched to the limit!&quot; the chief 
countered. &quot;I can&#39;t possibly put that many men on the streets!&quot;

&quot;I am supplementing the membership of the Desantniki to aid your men as 
well. Do not worry, chief. I and Mr. Chang will see to it that you and 
your department will be duly compensated for any inconveniences you may 
suffer,&quot; the Russian said.

Watsup sighed. &quot;Okay, if you think that might help, I&#39;ll even stay 
myself. Thanks for your time, Miss Balalaika.&quot; He then switched off the 
cellphone and leaned on the top of the car. &#39;Shit,&#39; he thought, &#39;it 
looks like I&#39;m going to have to cancel my tee time for tomorrow. 
However, if the danger is as great as Balalaika is eluding to, then I 
think a missed golf game is worth it.&#39; Stretching, he managed to get 
himself back into the squad car and continued his patrol.

All through the island all that night, the presence of the Roanapur 
Police Department, as well as members of the Desantniki, was felt 
throughout, from the darkest backstreet to the harbor area. This 
activity was particularly noticed by Hueng, who had his wharfside shop 
thoroughly searched by Balalaika&#39;s men. Once they had left, though, he 
frantically got on his cellphone and dialed the last number called. 
&quot;Natasha,&quot; he hissed, &quot;you wouldn&#39;t believe what is happening! I&#39;ve had 
some of that fry-faced bitch&#39;s men rummaging through my shop looking for 
you! Have you made it off the island?&quot;

THE OVERLAND BRIDGE...

&quot;Nyet, Hueng,&quot; Natasha Radinov replied. &quot;It seems that several of 
Chang&#39;s men are guarding the bridge off the island, as well as the shore 
beyond! I could easily take them on, but the guards are spaced so that 
even if I took out one of the posts, the others would raise the alarm!&quot; 
Indeed, in five places across the span of the bridge, posts of three or 
four men stood guard over the bridge, all of them linked to each other 
by hand-held radios and heavy machine guns. There were also patrols 
along the banks of the mainland, either by car or boat, at various 
times.

&quot;I don&#39;t like this!&quot; Hueng replied on the other end. &quot;What are you going 
to do?&quot;

&quot;What else can I do? Between the police, Chang and Balalaika, I&#39;m 
more-or-less boxed-in! It looks like we may have to wait it out for a 
bit!&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Hueng said. &quot;I&#39;ll see if I can find someplace safe where you can 
hide.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m very grateful for the help. I&#39;ll call you later.&quot; As she 
switched-off the cellphone. Radinov couldn&#39;t help to notice the wound 
she still had on her right hand. &#39;Very strange... the wound seems to be 
healing slower that what I&#39;m used to,&#39; she thought to herself. &#39;I wonder 
if the bullets that other vampire shot had some property that I don&#39;t 
know about. In the meantime, I had better contact my employers to see if 
they can provide me with transportation off the island!&#39;

THE HOTEL PENTHOUSE...

Seras was startled slightly when she felt Sir Integra&#39;s hand fall on her 
shoulder. &quot;It will be almost dawn soon,&quot; the Hellsing leader said. &quot;I 
suggest that you get yourself some rest. We&#39;ve got more than enough 
people to look after Rally.&quot;

The Draculina was silent for a time before saying in a depressed voice, 
&quot;I&#39;ve let Rally down.&quot;

&quot;Pardon?&quot; Sir Integra asked.

&quot;I am her master. It was my duty to protect her and I failed her in that 
part.&quot; Finally turning around, Sir Integra noticed a single bloody tear 
streaming down Seras&#39; cheek. &quot;I should&#39;ve been there for her when she 
went after Radinov instead of fighting the ghouls.&quot; She started sobbing, 
&quot;Now she&#39;s hurt and blinded... and it&#39;s entirely my fault!&quot;

&quot;Seras, do not trouble yourself over Rally&#39;s woes,&quot; the Hellsing leader 
said, using a tissue to clean the Draculina&#39;s face. &quot;I would guess that 
she would not want to hear of you so distressed over her. And I am 
certain she would not want you to neglect yourself.&quot; She then hugged 
Seras, &quot;Now I suggest you get yourself a blood ration and get yourself 
settled down. I still have to contact London.&quot;

&quot;Alright.&quot; She then went to the kitchen and reached for a unit of blood 
that Balalaika had generously stocked inside the refrigerator. While 
drinking it, she happened to pass near the room where Rally was 
convalescing, and noticed that her servant was still in agony, while 
Moria was changing the bandages over her eyes. &#39;I might be able to 
rest,&#39; she thought glumly, &#39;but Rally is in no state to.&#39;

&quot;Mignonette?&quot; Pip asked, noticing Seras&#39; mood, &quot;Are you feeling 
alright?&quot;

Seras just sighed. &quot;Leave me along, Pip... please?&quot; She then walked 
away. The mercenary could only shake his head sadly.

LONDON, THE HELLSING MANSION, SIR INTEGRA&#39;S OFFICE...

&quot;Dear God that is DREADFUL news!&quot; Walter C. Dolnez, the Hellsing butler 
and former trashman, gasped upon hearing the news of what happened to 
Rally. Next to him, Alucard stood grim-faced, the No-Life King&#39;s arms 
folded. &quot;Do you have any prognosis about Miss Vincent&#39;s recovery?&quot;

&quot;It will be slow-going, but I am confident she will recover, Walter,&quot; 
Sir Integra replied over the phone. &quot;But I would like to know if there 
is any truth about my father and the father of the Triad leader Mr. 
Chang?&quot;

&quot;Quite so,&quot; the butler said. &quot;In fact, Mr. Chang&#39;s father was a very 
valuable ally to the Hellsing Organization in the Asian area. Of course, 
Sir Arthur did not share in any of the Triad&#39;s illegal activities, that 
part your father made clear.&quot;

&quot;How fortunate,&quot; Sir Integra said. &quot;Well, at least my conscience will be 
clear about the matter. I know Hong Kong is no longer British, but I 
believe I might restart the relationship my father had in the past. It 
could be very valuable.&quot;

&quot;There is one thing I need to know, my master,&quot; Alucard added, &quot;How long 
do you intend to allow your friend to suffer needlessly?&quot;

There was an uncomfortable silence before Sir Integra replied, &quot;I 
realize what you are implying to, Alucard. I do not wish to see Rally 
suffer any more than needed, but we have to wait until the holy water 
within her body has run its course.&quot;

&quot;Sir Integra, there IS a way to expedite the process!&quot; the red-clad 
nosferatu said, &quot;If you&#39;ll just consider that method...&quot;

&quot;Alucard, I am aware of what you are saying, but I will only fall-back 
on that method as a last resort!&quot; the Hellsing leader replied rather 
loudly. &quot;Do I make myself clear?&quot;

Alucard stewed for a while, before replying quiet pleasantly, &quot;Very 
clear, my master.&quot;

&quot;Good. Now I do not want to have to repeat myself on this! I will keep 
you to appraised on the situation as it warrants. Goodbye.&quot; Then the 
connection broke off.

&quot;This is galling!&quot; Alucard growled. &quot;She is only causing Rally Vincent 
to endure needless pain just to satisfy her pride!&quot;

&quot;Alucard, please try to control yourself,&quot; the old butler said. &quot;I 
realize your concern for a fellow vampire, but the fact is that, even 
when she was a human, Miss Vincent suffered through a lot of pain, 
mostly through her former profession as a bounty hunter. She is much 
tougher than she appears.&quot; He then placed a hand on the No-Life King&#39;s 
shoulders and added, &quot;Besides Friend, much of it has to do with Miss 
Vincent&#39;s character. I mean, I do not believe she wished to be pushed 
into a situation she might later regret.&quot;

It took a while, but Alucard nodded in agreement. &quot;I believe you may be 
right, Walter,&quot; he said, smiling. &quot;After all, Rally is not one who 
wishes to cause anyone harm for her own sake.&quot;

&quot;That is true,&quot; Walter said. &quot;So, I best be getting to my rounds. I will 
be seeing you.&quot;

&quot;And you the same,&quot; Alucard added. But as the old butler left, he could 
only feel concerned about Rally. &#39;But no matter what you or my master 
wishes,&#39; he thought grimly to himself, &#39;I suspect that it may come to 
that point.&#39;

ROANAPUR, THE HOTEL PENTHOUSE, RALLY&#39;S BEDROOM...

&quot;There,&quot; Moria said pleasantly as she secured the bandage wrap around 
Rally&#39;s eyes, &quot;all done. I must admit, it&#39;s improving there.&quot; She then 
looked over to Rally as she gathered up the used bandages. Her breathing 
seemed to be easing, but she still looked to be in pain. &quot;Feeling any 
better?&quot;

&quot;A little... I guess,&quot; Rally muttered. &quot;Moria, could you give it to me 
straight? How bad is it, my injuries?&quot;

Moria took a little time to compose herself. &quot;Still a bit nasty, I&#39;m 
afraid,&quot; she said, &quot;although the skin in and around your eye sockets 
seems to have healed, that must be something.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, just as I thought,&quot; Rally said, who then suddenly arched her back 
as a new spasm hit. &quot;OH CRAP... CRAP... CRAP... CRAP!!&quot; she gasped, then 
she fell back, again breathing hard.

&quot;RALLY, ARE YOU ALRIGHT!?&quot; Moria cried-out, seeing what happened.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine. It&#39;s... it&#39;s just the holy water&#39;s way of 
telling me it&#39;s still there, that&#39;s all,&quot; Rally gasped.

&quot;Humph... you&#39;re a bit humorous, despite the situation,&quot; Moria laughed 
humorlessly.

Rally just nodded, then added, &quot;By the way... how&#39;s Master?&quot;

&quot;To tell you the truth... she&#39;s taking it quite hard,&quot; Moria observed. 
&quot;Seras has been blaming herself all night for what had happened to you, 
thinking she should&#39;ve been there.&quot;

&quot;She shouldn&#39;t put all the blame on herself,&quot; Rally said, sitting up 
slightly. &quot;It was my fault that I followed Radinov into that clearing 
without any backup. You&#39;d think that after many years of bounty hunting 
I would&#39;ve learned any better. I swear at times Roy might have been 
right about me: I tend to jump the gun without thinking things through.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not so certain about that. You do seem to have a good head on 
your shoulders, that much is true.&quot; Moria soon found herself yawning 
loudly.

&quot;Geez Moria,&quot; Rally said, &quot;it sounds like you need to get yourself to 
bed.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I think I&#39;d better or else I might keel-over the next time I 
change your bandages.&quot; Moria then gathered up the first-aid supplies and 
cleaned-up. &quot;All the same, don&#39;t be afraid to ask for anything, Rally.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll remember - ouch - that,&quot; Rally said, wincing as she laid back 
down.

However, Moira hesitated a bit. &quot;There is one question I would like to 
ask.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Rally replied.

&quot;Rally... what exactly does, &#39;H.L.S.&#39; means?&quot; the maid asked.

&quot;Huh?&quot; If Rally had her eyes, they would&#39;ve been wide from that 
question. &quot;Just what the hell do you mean by that? Where did you hear of 
it?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Moria began, feeling embarrassed, &quot;earlier, when you asked for 
the shower gel, while I was looking for it I happened to glance upon a 
pair of white thong panties. And there, silk-screened on the front of 
them in pink was the letters &#39;H.L.S.&#39;. I was wondering what it mean.&quot;

&quot;Oh crap,&quot; Rally grumbled, &quot;Master would&#39;ve packed THOSE!&quot; She then 
explained, &quot;Some time ago, Master happened to see those on this website 
and thought...&quot; she winced slightly, &quot;... that it would be cute if she 
got me a few pairs, which she did! She&#39;s been trying to get me to wear 
them since, but I&#39;ve been too embarrassed to do so!&quot;

&quot;But Rally...&quot; Moira implored.

&quot;Later, please?&quot; mumbled the dusky vampire. &quot;Right now, I just want to 
rest and try to kick this holy water.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; the maid said in a disappointed sigh, departing. But as 
soon as Moria left the room, she happened to see Revy leaning next to 
the door. Giving the mercenary a disgusted look, she walked past her.

Revy just shrugged as she glanced over to Rally&#39;s room. &quot;She gutting it 
out, I&#39;ve got to admit,&quot; she finally said to the maid.

&quot;Why should you care?&quot; Moria huffed. &quot;Not long ago, you&#39;ve wanted to 
steal her gun - even willing to kill her to do it!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but that was before that bitch Radinov up and tortured the hell 
out of her,&quot; countered Revy. Taking a careful look at the maid, she 
added, &quot;Look, it&#39;s obvious I&#39;m no angel, but I&#39;m not like that Russian 
assassin. When I kill, I make sure it&#39;s finished quickly: no pain, no 
agony. Radinov only did what she did to Rally just because she wanted to 
hear her scream. I hate bitches and bastards like that!&quot; She then walked 
over to Moria and further added, &quot;What I really admire is the way you&#39;ve 
kicked my ass back at the Yellow Flag.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;There&#39;s not many 
people who can do that and still live!&quot;

&quot;You deserved it,&quot; Moria growled, &quot;you and that toilet mouth of yours! I 
mean really - I have never seen such a wanton disregard for the Queen&#39;s 
English that I have seen in you! Isn&#39;t there anything you can say 
without adding an expletive every third word?&quot; She sighed and added, 
&quot;It&#39;s bad enough that Rally&#39;s master Seras is so out of sorts about this 
than to hear you.&quot;

&quot;Seras?&quot; Revy quipped, then she remembered. &quot;Oh, you mean that blonde 
with the big tits?&quot;

Moria spun around and angrily confronted Revy. &quot;See, that&#39;s what I&#39;m 
talking about!&quot; she hissed. &quot;You simply cannot make a statement without 
making it sound so sleazy! Why can&#39;t you, for once, have a civil 
conversation in your life?&quot;

&quot;Shit, I was just telling the truth, that&#39;s all.&quot; Revy then pointed to 
Moria rather ample bust and added, &quot;By the way, your tits are just as 
big as that blonde&#39;s.&quot;

It took all the will Moria had not to pound Revy into the floor, instead 
she covered her chest, blushing furiously as she did. &quot;OH WILL YOU 
PLEASE STOP THAT!?&quot; she pleaded. &quot;It was bad enough I was teased all 
through my school years because of my bust size, I don&#39;t need to hear 
about it from you! I pleaded with Grandfather if I could have a breast 
reduction operation but he wouldn&#39;t hear nothing of it! He said I should 
be grateful I was so blessed by God for it!&quot;

&quot;Maybe you should listen to him?&quot; Revy offered.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Moria seemed dumb-founded.

&quot;Look, many girls your age would kill their dog just to have a body like 
yours,&quot; Revy said. &quot;Sure they&#39;re big - but at least hers and your bodies 
are well-proportioned, so they look nice without being gross.&quot; She then 
added, &quot;Believe me, I&#39;ve seen streetwalkers and porn stars on the Lower 
East Side who had boob jobs that looked so fucking bad they looked as if 
they were from another world... not to mention those mad ass-kicking 
skills you have to teach them a lesson about teasing you.&quot;

&quot;Uh... I appreciate the praise, but not important right now,&quot; Moria 
mumbled, uncomfortable with the turn of this conversation. &quot;I&#39;m just 
concerned about Rally&#39;s well-being.&quot;

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Revy smirked, looking slyly at the flustered maid. &quot;I&#39;ve 
seen the way you&#39;re looking at her.&quot; She stirred the pot further, &quot;Look, 
I wouldn&#39;t blame you if you wanted to fuck that vampire then and there - 
well, at least until she&#39;s healed that is.&quot;

&quot;Please, don&#39;t say that?&quot; Moria asked morosely.

&quot;Say what?&quot;

Now Moria was really uncomfortable. &quot;You know... that... word!&quot;

Revy grinned further. &quot;What word EXACTLY?&quot; she said. However, when she 
only got an embarrassed silence, she figured she might help her out. 
&quot;Look, sit down before you faint,&quot; she said, pointing to the seat next 
to her. Moria reluctantly complied, although it was doubtful anyone 
might hear; everyone else, including the Lagoon Company, had gotten 
themselves asleep.

&quot;Listen, words are just words to me,&quot; Revy began, &quot;the only difference 
is how they are used. You criticize me mostly because the way the 
context I use is. Sure it&#39;s got a lot of negative feelings, but it could 
be a turn-on if it&#39;s just between lovers.&quot;

&quot;But it so wrong,&quot; Moira said, sounding a little sleepy.

&quot;Who knows? Granted you&#39;re one for proper English and I&#39;m one for 
creative cussing... but when you&#39;re with someone you love, it doesn&#39;t 
really matter,&quot; Revy added. &quot;Besides, I&#39;ve heard that dirty talk could 
actually make a night in the sack a good thing - just you, your lover 
and the four walls, nobody else.&quot; She then snorted to herself, &quot;See, I 
knew watching all those women&#39;s&#39; shows weren&#39;t such a waste! What do you 
think?&quot; she asked, turning around - only to find Moria deeply asleep.

&quot;Humph - so fucking tired, she fell asleep during my speech,&quot; Revy 
grumbled. She got up and covered the maid up with a casually-strewn 
blanket. &quot;Oh well, better hit the sack myself before Rock bitches about 
me dozing off during...&quot;

&quot;YYYEEEEEEEAAAAAAAUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!!&quot;

Everyone bolted from whatever sleep they had in raced to the source of 
the scream - Rally&#39;s room. The vampire was thrashing about, trying to 
claw at her own skin. &quot;OH GOD... OH GOD, PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!! 
AAAAAAUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHHH!!&quot;

&quot;WHAT&#39;S HAPPENING!?&quot; Sir Integra demanded, tying her robe as she entered 
the room.

Moria, as well as a recently-roused Seras, raced to both sides of the 
thrashing vampire, trying to calm her. &quot;ANOTHER SPASM... A BAD ONE!!&quot; 
the maid said, taking one of Rally&#39;s hands into hers.

&quot;Rally, I&#39;m here!&quot; Seras added, taking the other hand.

Rally took a few quick breaths, then tensed and gritted her teeth hard, 
fighting another scream. At the same time, she squeezed her hands just 
as hard. Seras just looked at her lover, bloody tears streaming from her 
face. However, Moira had a painful grimace on her face, and could only 
squeeze harder in order to keep Rally from accidentally crushing her 
hand.

Then as soon as it began, the spasm passed. Rally collapsed on her bed, 
finally passing out from the pain. &quot;OH NO!!&quot; Rock gasped. &quot;SHE&#39;S... 
SHE&#39;S NOT BREATHING!!, noticing the lack of breathing on Rally&#39;s part.

&quot;I would not worry too much, Mr. Okajima. Vampires are not living 
beings, and do not require breathing, nor have a discernable heartbeat,&quot; 
the Hellsing leader said. &quot;At least the silver lining from this incident 
is now she will be able to rest.&quot; Then she noticed her maid and saw the 
look of pain on Moria&#39;s face. &quot;Oh my.&quot;

As soon as Rally&#39;s grip on her hand was relaxed, Moria was able to pry 
her own hand from the vampire&#39;s. &quot;Miss Hedgley, are you alright?&quot; Sir 
Integra asked, noticing that the maid was gingerly clutching her right 
hand.

&quot;I... I think so, let me check.&quot; Moria then flexed her hand, only to 
wince when she did. &quot;OW!!&quot;

Cleaning her face, Seras looked at her friend. &#39;No... not Moria, too?&#39; 
she thought to herself.

&quot;Rally might have broken that hand of yours!&quot; the Hellsing leader said. 
&quot;I had better contact Balalaika to find out the location of a reasonably 
reliable hospital!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do you one better!&quot; Dutch offered. &quot;Rock, you better take this 
young lady to where we go whenever Revy gets herself hurt!&quot; He turned to 
the Hellsing leader, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, they&#39;re very good! I&#39;ll even pick-up 
the tab for you!&quot;

&quot;My thanks, sir,&quot; Moria offered as the former salaryman escorted her to 
the elevator.

However, Seras could only watch as the two left. She then went outside, 
trying to clear her head. The problem was, the more she thought about 
the situation, the angrier she became. &#39;That bloody bitch Radinov... she 
hurt and blinded Rally... and now as a result, Moira ends up hurt as 
well!&#39; As she thought, her grip on the guard rail around the deck 
tightened, causing a sizeable impression within the metal. &#39;That settles 
it! For Rally&#39;s sake and for Moria&#39;s sake... I&#39;m going to end this, one 
way or the other!&#39; Making up her mind, she stormed off, the impressions 
of her hands still visible on the guard rail.

FOUR HOURS LATER...

It had been some time since the spasm, but Rally finally woke up - only 
to wince again. &quot;Shit,&quot; she grumbled, &quot;even with that rest, I&#39;m still in 
pain.&quot; Her nose, however, caught a rather pungent scent, not normally 
discernable to human nostrils. &quot;Okay Revy,&quot; she said loudly, &quot;I know 
your in my room! What do you want?&quot;

Upon hearing the dusky vampire&#39;s voice, Revy had roused herself from the 
sleep she took while sitting against the wall. &quot;How do you know it&#39;s 
me?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Oh please, just because I&#39;m blind right - ouch - now, it doesn&#39;t mean 
my senses are dead as well!&quot; Rally said. &quot;I could smell your smokers&#39; 
breath clear as day!&quot;

Revy looked impressed. &quot;Nice to know. How are you feeling? Everyone was 
on edge that last spasm you had.&quot;

&quot;A little better, but I still hurt as hell!&quot; Rally sat up slightly and 
added, &quot;As soon as I get my eyes back, I&#39;m going to go looking for that 
Radinov and let her know how she worried everyone around here!&quot;

&quot;Now that sounds like the Rally Vincent I&#39;ve heard stories about,&quot; the 
brown-haired girl smirked, &quot;ready to cause shit to some dumb fuck that 
does her wrong.&quot;

&quot;Sheesh! You make it sound like I&#39;m pretty heartless!&quot; Rally said.

Revy simply shrugged as she walked over to a table, where she 
gathered-up Rally&#39;s CZ-75 lying there and walked over to the vampire&#39;s 
side. &quot;It wasn&#39;t me that started it; I just hear what&#39;s been already 
repeated,&quot; she said. &quot;Meanwhile, I better give you a little something.&quot; 
She then guided Rally&#39;s hand, where she placed the gun into it.

&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; the dusky vampire said, &quot;I thought you wanted my gun.&quot;

&quot;Hey, a girl can change her mind, can&#39;t she?&quot; Revy chuckled. &quot;Now don&#39;t 
worry it&#39;s unloaded, just in case you get one of those fucking monster 
spasms again.&quot;

&quot;So what am I - ouch - going to do with it?&quot;

Revy knew Rally hadn&#39;t regenerated her eyes, but stared at them all the 
same. &quot;Think of this as therapy,&quot; she said. &quot;Imagine that you&#39;ve got 
that Radinov bitch in your sights. Then you take aim and splatter her 
brains onto the pavement. Now I know you don&#39;t like to kill, but since 
you already killed that bitch before, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much of an 
issue.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Rally mused, her hand caressing her treasured gun.

&quot;Thought you might,&quot; Revy said, stretching. &quot;Now if you don&#39;t mind, I 
think the others should be up, so I better go in and annoy them a bit.&quot;

&quot;Hey wait - before you do, I&#39;ve got something to ask.&quot;

&quot;Okay - shoot, what do you need to know?&quot; asked Revy.

Rally thought for a moment of how to place the words. &quot;Have you ever 
heard of a place called Arisugawa&#39;s Locket?&quot;

Revy shook her head, &quot;Naw. Why did you ask?&quot;

&quot;Oh nothing,&quot; Rally dismissed, &quot;just something I was curious about.&quot; She 
then thought, &#39;At least she&#39;s not the Revy I heard about there.&#39; Then 
she said, &quot;But if you go there, do me a favor - when the bartender asks 
for your guns, don&#39;t make a scene about it and do it; she&#39;ll get them 
back to you.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah,&quot; Revy muttered, wondering why she said that.

DOWNSTAIRS...

&quot;Man, it was a good thing there wasn&#39;t anything seriously wrong with 
that hand,&quot; Rock said as he and Moria headed for the elevator.

&quot;Indeed, nothing more than a minor stress fracture,&quot; the maid said in 
perfect Japanese, looking at her bandaged hand. &quot;All the same, as soon 
as I get back to England, I better have Dr. Trevelyan look at it anyway, 
just to be sure.&quot;

Rock nodded as he called for the car. He then turned to Moria and added, 
&quot;You know, I&#39;m a bit fascinated about your grasp of languages. From what 
I&#39;ve seen, you addressed Balalaika in Russian, me in Japanese, and when 
that Filipino doctor looked at your hand, you spoke to him in Tagalog.&quot;

&quot;Well what can I say?&quot; replied Moria. &quot;I&#39;ve always this interest in 
language since I was a little girl. By the time I was five, I had 
already learned French, Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese. Now my fluency is 
up to at least 15 languages. My grandfather - god bless his soul - would 
get a little annoyed whenever I would bring home a new language phrase 
manual from the bookstore, but then would later would be happy that I&#39;ve 
learned a new way of speaking as a result.&quot;

The door chime ringed, and the two entered the private car. &quot;You know,&quot; 
Rock said as the doors closed, &quot;I&#39;ve noticed that you&#39;re pretty 
talented, not only in language but in martial arts. I wonder why you 
didn&#39;t follow your grandfather into the service?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s rather difficult, Okajima-san,&quot; Moria said, a profound look coming 
over her face. &quot;I suppose that I don&#39;t really have the discipline for a 
life in the military. As for my fighting skills - well - it was my dear 
grandfather didn&#39;t want me to ever be a victim.&quot;

&quot;A victim?&quot; Rock repeated.

Moria nodded. &quot;A victim of some &#39;gay-bashing&#39; attack on London&#39;s 
streets, there&#39;s a lot of it in the West End these days.&quot;

&quot;You - a lesbian?&quot; Rock gasped.

&quot;Odd, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Moria said with a smile. Rock nodded. &quot;Not all lesbians 
are masculine butches anyway. Just look at Rally and Seras to prove my 
point. Strange though, I found out about my homosexuality while I was in 
school. One day, out of sheer petulance, one of the girls of the school 
snuck-up from behind and groped my breasts.&quot;

She took a breath before continuing. &quot;While she was squeezing them the 
way she was, I found her touch - well - rather arousing. After that, 
whenever I would be changing for gym class, I would often find myself 
staring at the other girls while they were changing, often fantasizing 
on how I would seduce each and every one of them. I never did touch 
them, though.&quot; She paused to wipe away a tear. &quot;I thought I was 
defective, and was so distraught I had confessed to Grandfather the 
whole thing.&quot; She then smiled, &quot;He understood everything I was going 
through, although he didn&#39;t exactly approve, but Grandfather - Peter 
Farguson was his name - also said that I would face others who didn&#39;t 
share in his tolerance. He insisted that I take self-defense classes 
almost the next day. He also insisted I take up marksmanship as well.&quot;

&quot;You were very lucky to have such a family you had,&quot; Rock said, thinking 
about his own disconnect with his family. &quot;What exactly happened to your 
grandfather, if I might ask?&quot;

Moria&#39;s face seemed to falter. &quot;A cruel deception committed both by a 
traitor within the Knights of the Round Table - and a vampire named 
Incognito. I&#39;d rather not discuss the exact details of that incident. 
All I can say is that my grandfather&#39;s character and reputation were 
called to question as a result and couldn&#39;t defend both since he was 
deceased. It was only because of the intervention of the Queen that 
both, along with the Hellsing Organization, were restored, Okajima-san.&quot;

&quot;Then I won&#39;t ask any further, and please you can call me &#39;Rock&#39;,&quot; the 
former salaryman chuckled. &quot;I had my fill of honorifics back when I 
worked for Asahi, and besides everybody else here calls me that.&quot;

&quot;I mean to ask you one thing - why in the world would you leave a 
perfectly legitimate job for one which you have to put-up with a 
violent, vulgar woman like Revy?&quot; asked Moria.

Rock&#39;s features hardened. &quot;For one thing, I found out that the disc my 
bosses were having me transport had plans for nuclear weapons and sent a 
company of mercenaries to get rid of the Lagoon Company, me included in 
order to save their own butts and expense accounts.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Moria said as the doors opened, leading to the penthouse 
entrance. &quot;You would think that a country that has been a victim of 
nuclear weapons would think better of that.&quot;

&quot;Agreed. Besides, even if I stayed in Asahi, I would&#39;ve been a candidate 
for karoshi anyway,&quot; Rock shrugged. &quot;And as for Revy, I wouldn&#39;t worry 
too much about her. Granted, she can be loud, pushy and greedy, but if I 
lived the life she did, it would be understandable.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;ll just keep that in mind, Oka... I mean, Rock,&quot; Moria corrected 
herself.

ANOTHER PART OF THE ISLAND...

&quot;But Major, I must implore you, I need transportation off this island!&quot; 
Radinov demanded over her phone. &quot;Somehow the crimelords of this island 
have joined forces with the police and are now looking for me! I feel 
that, since I was able to obtain your chip, you should at least give me 
the proper means to escape this place!&quot;

&quot;And I appreciate you all your help, Frauline Radinov,&quot; the Major calmly 
answered on the other end, &quot;but I am afraid that all of Millennium&#39;s 
resources are currently allocated to our upcoming var. But don&#39;t vorry, 
I&#39;m certain you vill effect your escape. I vill see you later.&quot; He then 
hung up.

Radinov, however, glared angrily at the phone. &quot;Damned Nazi pig!&quot; she 
snarled under her breath. &quot;He concerned only with his precious war that 
he couldn&#39;t even spare a little help for someone that did him a favor!&quot; 
Then quite suddenly, the phone rang. &quot;WHAT!?&quot; she snapped as she 
answered.

&quot;Natasha, calm down!&quot; Hueng&#39;s voice said. &quot;I just wanted to see how you 
were doing?&quot;

Radinov sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, old friend,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyway, have you 
found any way to evade the patrols?&quot;

&quot;None yet,&quot; he sighed.

&quot;I see. Well, continue monitoring and let me know if anything changes.&quot; 
Radinov then switched off the phone.

HUENG&#39;S SHOP...

A look of worry was on Hueng&#39;s face. &quot;She&#39;s getting anxious,&quot; he said to 
himself. &quot;Balalaika and Chang has gotten her boxed-in and she&#39;s showing 
it. How can I help her?&quot; He remembered the time he first met Radinov; he 
had been bullied by his former boss. For the first time in her life, she 
had felt pity on someone, and killed that crimelord.

To help her new-found friend out, she sought out her long-time client, 
the Italian Verrocchio, and helped Hueng to establish his own business - 
which he also used as a front for Verrocchio&#39;s fencing operations. All 
during that time, Hueng had gotten a reputation of being a savvy 
businessman, as well as someone who knew how to keep quiet.

That all changed when Balalaika had moved into Roanapur, and almost 
immedietly began to edge Verrocchio out of his prime smuggling routes. 
It gotten even worst when Chang had established his own operations on 
the island from Hong Kong - and was even allying with Balalaika in many 
ventures. Out of desperation - and in the hopes of consolidating his 
operations, the Italian had made the decision to hire the Vampire Twins, 
Hansel and Gretel, to kill them. However, the two proved to be 
pathological killers, and Verrocchio was killed because of their urges.

Ever since then, with the loss of his patron, and Verrocchio&#39;s successor 
Dago proving to be interested in ONLY his business, Hueng&#39;s fortunes had 
taken a turn for the worst, gaining the nickname &#39;Hard-Luck&#39; Hueng by 
many of those seeing to get even with him.

But Radinov, despite an extended absence, was one friend he could count 
on, and he so wanted to return the favor. Looking on the walls of his 
now-ransacked shop, he happened to notices an object hanging from the 
wall - an iron spear with a brass tip. Deciding quickly, he grabbed it 
off the wall and took-off for where he told Radinov to hide.

RADINOV&#39;S LOCALE...

Thankfully, there was no full moon, so Radinov was able to step outside 
the hut Hueng found for her. As she watched the stars overhead, she 
began to seriously consider what her employers may have for her future. 
Surely the Major had reassured her that she wouldn&#39;t have anymore 
obligations. But then again, she did remember from history that Hitler 
had sought-out and got a non-aggression pact with Mother Russia, only to 
have that pact broken as a result of Operation Barbarossa in 1940. &#39;Can 
I REALLY trust a bunch of Nazis? I had better keep an eye on them in the 
future once this is over,&#39; she thought to herself. Finally getting tired 
of looking at stars, she decided to return to the hut.

&quot;It took a while, but I&#39;ve finally found you, Natasha Radinov!&quot; a voice 
- female and British in tone - called out from behind. Startled, Radinov 
turned around. Seras was standing behind her, wearing her yellow 
Hellsing uniform. The look on the Draculina&#39;s face showed it all, mostly 
anger. &quot;You&#39;re going to pay for what you did to Rally!&quot;

Radinov smirked at this new interloper. &quot;Oh my,&quot; she slyly said, &quot;it 
looks like my enemies are now sending children against me. How 
charming!&quot;

&quot;That will be enough!&quot; Seras snapped. &quot;Are you going to fight me or are 
you just going to act snide?&quot;

&quot;It depends, little girl,&quot; Radinov said. &quot;Just who exactly are you?&quot;

&quot;My name is Seras Victoria, of the house of Dracul,&quot; Seras replied in a 
low voice, &quot;former servant to Vlad II Dracula and master to Rally 
Vincent.&quot;

&quot;Oh... so you&#39;re the one to blame for what befell Rally Vincent?&quot; 
Radinov smirked, choosing here words carefully - not to avoid a fight, 
but to goad Seras into acting rashly. &quot;I must admit, I never thought I 
would be facing someone who was the very cause of her downfall.&quot;

Seras felt her blood boiling, mostly because she felt Radinov was 
hitting too close to the mark. &quot;I WAS NOT THE ONE WHO SHOT RALLY FULL OF 
HOLY WATER, NOR THE ONE WHO BLINDED HER WITH IT!!&quot; she yelled.

&quot;True, all of it true,&quot; Radinov added. &quot;But then again, it was through 
you that Rally had inherited all her defects.&quot; She produced a bottle of 
holy water and dripped a few drops on her now-healed hand. When there 
was no effect, she flicked several drops at Seras, some of them hitting 
and sizzling when they hit her bare arm. &quot;See... you are burned by just 
a few drops,&quot; Radinov continued to smirk, seeing the rage in Seras&#39; 
face. &quot;When it comes down to it, the fact is that it was YOU that 
brought on Rally Vincent&#39;s misfortune - by passing on the defects to her 
body. YOU were the one that hurt her, not me!&quot;

That did it! With bloody tears streaming from her face, an enraged and 
screaming Seras launched out against Radinov, determined to tear her 
apart!
