<h1>Night Angels (part 5 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/niteangel-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE 1 &#150; &quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket&quot;, and the character usage thereof, 
is the creation of Shanejayell. I&#39;m just borrowing the concept for this 
fic &#150; which is going to be an INTERESTING one. Total guest character 
list (either appearing or just mentioned) will follow at the end of the 
fic.

AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE 2 &#150; During the encounter at Arisugawa&#39;s Locket, I&#39;ve 
decided on a way to distinguish the two Rally Vincents. Unless otherwise 
noted, the vampire Rally will be known as &#39;Rally V&#39;, while the human one 
will be referred to as &#39;Rally H&#39;. Hopefully, that&#39;ll end any confusion 
between the two.

Thus said... ON WITH THE FIC!

XXX

&quot;Now... let me understand this,&quot; Seras Victoria said to Juri Arisugawa, 
who was seated at the table with herself, the two versions of Irene 
&quot;Rally&quot; Vincent, and Misty Brown, &quot;you say that you have no way of 
controlling where this... club&#39;s location is at any given time? And 
these two,&quot; she pointed to Rally H and Misty Brown, who were seated next 
to each other, &quot;are from an entirely different reality than me and my 
Rally?&quot;

Juri nodded, absently rotating her glass of colored ginger ale as she 
added, &quot;Not only that, it seems that this place can exist at several 
locations at the same time. And please, whatever you do, if you even 
happen to meet Washu one of these days, I would ask you NOT to have HER 
explain it! Believe me, I tried one day and nearly died from boredom 
from her lecture on the subject of dimensional variations and quantum 
anomalies!&quot;

While taking in this information, Rally V simply sipped the glass of 
O-negative blood that was offered to her and her master by this 
interesting woman, all the while looking at Misty and her lover. &#39;So 
this Misty is not from where I came from,&#39; she thought to herself. 
&#39;Interesting... but it&#39;s still unsettling.&#39; She then noted how closely 
Misty sat to Rally H, causing the vampire to wonder what would have 
happened if she had not heard of the Hellsing Organization. &#39;I could be 
looking at what could&#39;ve been my life right now... if I hadn&#39;t become a 
vampire.&#39;

&quot;And it&#39;s not JUST other realities in this time, Seras,&quot; Juri added. &quot;We 
seem to get many customers from other eras in time &#150; even other planets, 
from what I&#39;ve seen.&quot; The orange-haired woman then indicated to the 
various women patrons of Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. Many of them wore outfits 
from the distant past, and a few from different futuristic eras. &quot;But 
whatever or wherever they came from, there is one rule they abide with &#150; 
that this place is neutral territory, and whatever quarrel they may have 
on the outside, they leave it at the door, come in and enjoy 
themselves.&quot;

Rally V then decided to speak. &quot;That&#39;s interesting. And speaking of 
interesting,&quot; she indicated to her glass, &quot;I&#39;ve noticed that this blood 
tasted fresh. Does this mean you serve other vampires here as well? And 
where do you get the blood to serve them?&quot;

&quot;Yes we do. Just because some of our patrons are vampires, it doesn&#39;t 
mean we discriminate against them,&quot; Juri answered. &quot;And if you&#39;re 
wondering about the blood, that is donated freely from various sources. 
Now don&#39;t worry about anyone being harmed, they&#39;re told up-front how the 
blood will be distributed.&quot; She then looked above the patrons and 
noticed a dark brown-haired woman carrying what appeared to be several 
receipts and other paperwork beckoning her. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I 
believe my financial advisor, Nakibi, is trying to nail me down on 
figuring out last month&#39;s profits, so I&#39;ll be leaving you four to 
yourselves.&quot; Juri then picked up her drink and left the table.

&quot;Well, at least we can tell Integra that there&#39;s no shady business going 
on here, Master,&quot; Rally V remarked, seeing Juri head to the bar, where 
she was met by Nakibi.

&quot;No doubt,&quot; Seras added, then turned her attention to Rally H and Misty. 
&quot;Look, me and my fledgling would like to apologize for that little 
misunderstanding before Miss Arisugawa interceded.&quot;

&quot;Hey, no problem,&quot; the dusky skinned bounty hunter answered. &quot;And 
please, she likes to be called &#39;Juri&#39;. She&#39;s not really that formal.&quot;

&quot;Good for business, knowing the owner on a &#39;first-name basis,&quot; Misty 
added, smiling. She then turned to the vampires, which caused Rally V to 
slightly flinch, and said, &quot;So tell me, how do you like this place?&quot;

XXX

Juri made her way to the bar, afterwhich she set down her glass and let 
out a big sigh of relief. Nakibi Tendo, in the meantime, walked-up next 
to her after she got a look at the table she visited. &quot;I can understand 
why you had to duck-out of the office after Hitomi called,&quot; she began, 
setting down her paperwork. &quot;Believe me, Juri, if I ever found myself 
looking at another &#39;me&#39;, I too would feel a little out-of it.&quot; She then 
pointed to her papers and added, &quot;Oh, and don&#39;t worry about all this, I 
just wanted to show you some of the figures before I went to the bank 
with it.&quot;

&quot;Thanks a lot,&quot; Juri mumbled, slightly smiling.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t mention it,&quot; Nakibi added. &quot;Being the peacemaker works for 
you, especially how you were able to settle that little dispute last 
month or I would&#39;ve had to deal with repair costs in this paperwork.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not why I opened this place, Nakibi,&quot; Juri grumbled. &quot;And as for 
that &#39;little incident&#39; last month,&quot; she then looked at Ryoko, &quot;it would 
have been nothing if you hadn&#39;t been too combative.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I was only enforcing the rules, nothing more,&quot; the cyan-haired 
girl said in her defense, &quot;It wasn&#39;t my fault she got into a huff about 
it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Juri,&quot; Minagi, Ryoko&#39;s twin said, noticing the conversation. &quot;It 
was a good thing you were there at the time or else things would&#39;ve 
gotten really hairy.&quot;

&quot;Well it&#39;s nice to know, but I don&#39;t want to be reminded about that 
again. I already got Setsuna worried to death because of it. Rehashing 
it will only make it worse,&quot; said Juri.

&quot;I hate to say this, Juri,&quot; Nakibi put in, &quot;but if those two vampires 
did get into it, the situation would&#39;ve been ten or even a hundred times 
worse than that.&quot;

&quot;I know that,&quot; Juri moaned, rubbing her temples. &quot;It was only fortunate 
that those two were willing to listen to reason first.&quot;

&quot;And now look at them now,&quot; Ryoko added, pointing to them. &quot;They&#39;re 
acting like they&#39;ve known each other for years.&quot;

Juri did look, a small smile crossing her face. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if Setsuna 
is going to believe what happened tonight. In fact, I STILL don&#39;t 
believe it myself.&quot;

&quot;Tell you what,&quot; Nakibi remarked, &quot;if Setsuna finds it hard to believe, 
I&#39;ll back you up all the way telling her.&quot; Juri gave her a &#39;thumbs-up&#39; 
in confirmation.

XXX

&quot;...And then,&quot; Rally H continued to tell her counterpart and her master, 
&quot;there was the time last month when Revy nearly got herself and her date 
thrown-out for not abiding by the club&#39;s rules.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Misty added, &quot;it was their first time here, so I wouldn&#39;t 
blame them for the misunderstanding.&quot;

&quot;You said it, Misty,&quot; Rally H said.

&quot;What was it that caused the whole thing in the first place,&quot; asked 
Rally V, curious.

&quot;Oh... Revy wouldn&#39;t hand in her guns to Ryoko at the bar before being 
served,&quot; Misty answered.

&quot;It would&#39;ve been so bad... until that tattooed jerk mentioned the 
&#39;cold, dead fingers&#39; bit when Ryoko asked for her guns. Then Ryoko got 
really angry and threatened to stuff her ass into a black hole, if she 
knew where to find one,&quot; Rally H also observed. &quot;I nearly went for my 
guns myself... then I remembered I left them at the bar! Luckily, Juri 
was on the floor at the time, and she and Revy&#39;s date were able to 
defuse the situation before any shots were fired.&quot; She leaned back and 
added, &quot;You know, Balalaika may be a ruthless crimelord on Roanapur, but 
she knew how to reassure Revy that those chrome-plated beauties of hers 
would get back into her hands when they left.&quot;

Misty nodded in agreement, &quot;And Balalaika&#39;s a very beautiful woman as 
well, even with those scars on her face.&quot;

Seras smiled, hearing the tale the two humans related about their 
experiences at Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. Then she glanced over to her 
fledgling and became concerned about Rally V&#39;s unease around Misty. 
&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;we&#39;ve heard a lot about your adventures at this 
place, but how did you discover this place to begin with?&quot;

Before an answer could be given, another voice called-out from behind 
the two vampires, &quot;Uh... excuse me,&quot; a meek-sounding voice said. 
Everyone turned to face a young woman wearing a costume with two shades 
of purple. Even though the black-haired girl was quite pretty, Seras and 
Rally V couldn&#39;t help to see that she was unusually pale, as if she was 
ill. &quot;I was wondering if I would... uhhhh...&quot; Suddenly, a small trail of 
blood dripped from the girl&#39;s mouth as her eyes rolled-up her head, then 
she collapsed to the floor, apparently not breathing.

&quot;OH NO!!!&quot; Seras gasped.

Rally V was equally shocked. &quot;DID... DID THAT GIRL JUST DIE!?!?&quot; she 
managed to say.

&quot;Oh hi, Hyatt,&quot; Rally H said, not seemingly surprised at her collapse. 
&quot;I think I&#39;ll forgoe my usual pizza and garlic bread and have a 
ham-and-swiss on a hoagie roll, whole-grain chips, a kosher spear, and 
Misty will have her usual. And tell Sasami it&#39;s no hurry.&quot;

&quot;WHAT THE BLOODY HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT!?!&quot; Seras angrily said, 
glaring at Rally H. &quot;THIS GIRL HAS DIED AND ALL YOU DO IS...&quot;

&quot;Thank you, I&#39;ll get your order to the kitchen right away,&quot; Hyatt&#39;s 
voice weakly said from the floor. Both Seras and Rally V looked in shock 
as Hyatt managed to slither among the throng of women and to the 
kitchen. Then their attention turned back to Rally H and Misty, the look 
of shock still on their faces.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, Hyatt is always dying like that,&quot; Misty giggled. &quot;She&#39;s 
actually a very good worker, along with her lover Excel.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah,&quot; Rally V mumbled, the shock wearing off. &quot;Boy, this place 
is one big surprise after another.&quot;

&quot;Want to know another surprise?&quot; Rally H added. &quot;At one time, Goldie was 
a regular here as well. She was a good customer, too... until she 
started selling that Kerasine of hers inside, which caused Juri to ban 
her for life.&quot; She paused before continuing, &quot;From what I heard from 
Juri later, Goldie tried to strong-arm herself back in a couple of 
months later, using one of her girls as the &#39;willing hostage&#39;, before a 
girl named Ichigo distracted her long enough so that Cybersix could 
disarm Goldie and the girl.&quot;

&quot;Cybersix?&quot; Seras asked.

&quot;The usual doorwoman,&quot; Misty answered. &quot;But from what we&#39;ve heard, this 
week, she had to stay in Meridian because of some trouble there, so 
Ramna filled-in for this week.&quot;

&quot;That must have been the girl Pip ran into last night,&quot; Rally V said, 
then turned to her counterpart and added, &quot;So you&#39;re still having 
trouble with Goldie.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, yes,&quot; Rally H sighed. &quot;How about you?&quot;

&quot;She was a problem... but not anymore. She&#39;s dead.&quot;

&quot;Are you certain she is?&quot; Rally H asked. &quot;I&#39;ve did everything to get rid 
of her, but she keeps coming back.&quot;

&quot;Oh believe me,&quot; the dusky-skinned vampire said as she leaned on the 
table, &quot;she&#39;s dead. I made sure of that myself.&quot; After she said that, 
Rally V smiled... which showed-off one of her fangs.

Both Rally H and Misty looked a little startled about Rally V&#39;s 
almost-nonchalant display. &quot;Well then,&quot; Rally H managed to say after 
recovering, &quot;if... you say that your Goldie&#39;s dead, then I believe you.&quot; 
She then added mentally, &#39;Although you do have a somewhat creepy way of 
showing it!&#39;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; another voice called from behind. The girls turn to see 
another girl, dressed in what appeared to be a black maid&#39;s uniform, 
standing behind them with a tray. &quot;I know you said it was no hurry, but 
Sasami had a lot of the items you ordered on-hand, so she was able to 
get your order out sooner.&quot;

Both Rally V and Seras looked at the smiling black-haired maid. She 
seemed normal enough, but there was... something odd both of them sensed 
about her. &#39;It&#39;s weird, Master,&#39; the dusky vampire thought. &#39;It&#39;s almost 
like... she isn&#39;t human.&#39;

&#39;I&#39;ve noticed it, too, Rally,&#39; Seras added. &#39;This place seems to attract 
the most unusual people.&#39;

&quot;Oh thanks, Mahoro,&quot; Misty said, helping the blue-eyed maid with the 
food she and Rally H ordered. Misty had an order of baked chicken, 
steamed vegetables and buttered noodles, and Rally H her sandwich order.

Rally H then noticed the vampires&#39; attention to Mahoro Ando, as the maid 
left the table. &quot;Before you ask,&quot; she began, &quot;yes, she&#39;s an android. In 
fact, Juri told us she used to be a battle android before coming here. 
Alpha&#39;s another one, but it&#39;s her day-off.&quot;

Seras returned her attention to the two humans. &quot;How do you two get used 
to this place, with all the different types of people who come here?&quot;

&quot;The only way we can,&quot; Misty offered. &quot;Besides, we&#39;re all women here, so 
it&#39;s no big deal.&quot;

&quot;Which goes back to your earlier question, how I discovered this place,&quot; 
Rally H added. &quot;I got a call from Misty one day to meet her here. To 
tell the truth, I was a little surprised that this was an all-female bar 
&#150; and was even more surprised when one of the patrons tried to pick me 
up.&quot;

&quot;I still think Lady Une&#39;s kicking herself by letting you go,&quot; Misty 
laughed.

&quot;You said it, Misty,&quot; Rally H in turn laughed. &quot;Anyway, I was a little 
curious why Misty here asked me to come her... then I found out she 
loved me.&quot;

&quot;She... loved you?&quot; Rally V gulped, thinking about what may have 
happened with her.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Misty said, leaning close to Rally H. &quot;At first, Rally was a 
little hesitant about entering into a relationship, so we decided to 
take it one day at a time. After a few months of this, she finally 
admitted that she was in love with me as well, and we&#39;ve been together 
since.&quot; She turned around and kissed Rally H delicately on the lips, 
which the dark-skinned bounty hunter done in turn.

A few of the clientele around them noticed this, and gave the two a 
small cheer, although one girl &#150; a redhead with blue eyes and dressed in 
a skimpy cowgirl outfit, turned away from her date, a white haired girl 
with red eyes, and playfully chirped up, &quot;C&#39;mon you two, why don&#39;t you 
get one of the rooms upstairs and do that?&quot;

Misty turned around to the girl, smiled and said back, &quot;None of your 
business, Meg. Why don&#39;t you and Jo get back to your drinks?&quot;

Rally V&#39;s eyebrows raised slightly. &quot;Uh... what exactly did she mean 
by... rooms upstairs?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Well... since there are still quite a bit of homophobic types hanging 
around,&quot; Rally H began, &quot;Juri had a few rooms built upstairs for nightly 
or hourly rent. That way, if any of the girls and their dates are 
feeling,&quot; she blushed, &quot;a little intimate, then that&#39;s where they go. In 
fact, we thought we would give May a break and spend the night here. 
She&#39;s been complaining of late, mostly on how loud me and Misty are.&quot;

&quot;She should be the one to complain,&quot; added Misty, &quot;the way she and Kenny 
go at it when he comes over.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s for certain, Misty,&quot; Rally H finished. &quot;I&#39;ll be headed for the 
bar and find out from Ryoko about a nightly rental. Be back in a bit.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m going to go outside to make the report to Sir Integra,&quot; said 
Seras, getting up from her seat. &quot;Rally,&quot; she told Rally V, &quot;you stay 
here with Misty until we get back.&quot;

&quot;What? B-but Master...&quot; the dusky vampire stammered.

&quot;Rally... just stay,&quot; Seras said firmly, eye her fledgling decidedly.

Suddenly, Rally V felt her insides clenching. It wasn&#39;t painful... but 
it was uncomfortable, to say the least. &quot;Yes... Master,&quot; she said 
dejectedly.

Looking a little sorrowful for having to discipline Rally V in such a 
way, Seras knelt down, cleared her mind and thought, &#39;Don&#39;t worry, it 
won&#39;t take long. Just to be on the safe side, I&#39;ll ask Juri to accompany 
me to explain to Sir Integra about her establishment.&#39;

&#39;Okay, Master. It&#39;s just that...&#39; Rally V began, but Seras cut her off 
and headed to the bar to talk to Juri. &quot;Dammit,&quot; she whispered to 
herself, &quot;I wonder if Alucard taught her that little trick she did. It 
wasn&#39;t very comfortable, that&#39;s for certain.&quot; Sighing, she slumped down 
on the table and absently watched the other patrons.

&quot;Rally... is something wrong?&quot; Misty&#39;s voice piped up, catching the 
vampire&#39;s attention.

&quot;Huh? Oh... it&#39;s nothing really,&quot; Rally V said, finally looking at 
Misty. &quot;Sorry about earlier. It&#39;s just that... well... I didn&#39;t expect 
to see you here... well, what I mean is...&quot; She thought about what she 
said next. &quot;I thought you were the Misty from MY reality.&quot;

&quot;Oh I already know that,&quot; Misty giggled. Then her expression got 
serious. &quot;I was just wondering about your reaction, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Well... yesterday, I got a letter from the Misty from where I live,&quot; 
began Rally V. &quot;She had left Chicago abruptly when Goldie returned and 
was not present when...&quot; she took a deep breath, clearly unnecessary, 
&quot;when I was turned. She&#39;s due at the Hellsing mansion tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;And you think she doesn&#39;t know you&#39;re a vampire now?&quot; asked Misty.

Rally V shrugged. &quot;She didn&#39;t say. All I got was her saying that she 
wanted to talk to me when she got there. To tell the truth... I&#39;m not 
sure how to approach this, Misty. Will she understand... or...&quot;

&quot;Okay, stop right there!&quot; Misty interrupted. &quot;Look, even if my Rally was 
turned into a vampire herself, I wouldn&#39;t care one way or the other! 
Rally, listen to me on this... I&#39;ve done a lot of wrong things in my 
life... many of them I now regret, and if it weren&#39;t for my Rally, I 
would&#39;ve possibly ended-up in prison... or dead!&quot; She then reached out 
for Rally V&#39;s hand and clenched it tight. &quot;Even though this hand I&#39;m 
holding right now is as cold as death and has no heartbeat, I know that 
the same Rally I know is still in there! And if the Misty in your 
reality were here, I believe she would feel the same!&quot;

Rally V looked at Misty, a look of surprise on her face. &quot;You... really 
believe that&#39;s true, Misty?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I know that it&#39;s true! Rally, don&#39;t be afraid about facing her, for I&#39;m 
certain she&#39;s going to say the same things I&#39;ve told you right now,&quot; 
Misty added, patting Rally V&#39;s hand.

&quot;Thanks, Misty... I think I might do that,&quot; Rally V said, smiling.

While this was going on, Rally H looked back from her negotiations for 
the room to see the two. &quot;I kinda figured that Seras had this in mind 
when she insisted that her Rally stay with Misty,&quot; she said, smiling. 
&quot;From the way my vampire counterpart was acting, I&#39;m guessing that she 
has to face her Misty soon. Couldn&#39;t blame her, though.&quot;

Ryoko also looked at the two. &quot;From what I&#39;ve heard from the two, I 
think Misty&#39;s helping her with her problem.&quot;

Rally H looked back at the cyan-haired barkeeper. &quot;Guess having those 
ears of yours is handy,&quot; she replied, indicating to Ryoko&#39;s rather 
sizable ears.

&quot;Hey, they&#39;re helpful,&quot; Ryoko said, shrugging.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Rally H was silent for a good three seconds before saying, 
&quot;Y&#39;know... before coming here, I&#39;ve been thinking about something I&#39;ve 
been putting off for a few months... and seeing myself as a vampire has 
got me seriously thinking about doing it tonight!&quot;

&quot;Hey, I&#39;d go for it if I were you,&quot; Ryoko offered.

OUTSIDE...

&quot;...And that&#39;s the story, Sir Integra,&quot; Juri said on the cellphone that 
Seras had lent the orange-haired bar owner. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if we&#39;ve caused 
you any concern.&quot;

&quot;That is alright, Miss Arisugawa. I am glad that your bar&#39;s presence had 
no hostile intentions, that is all,&quot; the voice of Sir Integra Fairbrook 
Wingates Hellsing replied. &quot;As for that... little incident yesterday, I 
would like to offer my apologies as well. It was a poor choice on my 
part for selecting men for the job.&quot;

&quot;I hope Ramna didn&#39;t hurt them too much,&quot; Juri added. &quot;She was only 
enforcing the bar&#39;s policies... and please, call me Juri.&quot;

&quot;Nothing that a few bandages and bed rest would not accomplish,&quot; Sir 
Integra answered. &quot;They are good soldiers, but can be a bit impulsive at 
times.&quot; She thought a while before adding, &quot;And I wouldn&#39;t call you 
anything less... Juri.&quot;

As the conversation continued, Seras leaned against the building, with 
Ramna Saotome looking on. The Draculina turned back to the red-headed 
martial artist and said, &quot;You know, you really gave Pip and the Wild 
Geese a good thrashing last night.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about that,&quot; Ramna offered, her blue eyes twinkling. &quot;But 
they were trying to force their way through and I was just doing my job, 
that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;But you DID impress Pip with your work, from what I&#39;ve heard from him,&quot; 
Seras added with a smile, then offered, &quot;If you like, you might want to 
join the Wild Geese yourself. I&#39;m certain he wouldn&#39;t mind having a girl 
on the unit, but you&#39;ll have to put up with his perverted antics as a 
result.&quot;

Ramna thought for a moment. &quot;Tempting,&quot; she said, &quot;but I think I&#39;ll stay 
where I am right now. Besides, if Akane ever found out that this Pip was 
trying to pick me up in this form, I think she&#39;ll come over to your 
reality and do even more than I did.&quot; She thought some more, &quot;Or she 
might try to cook for them. That would cause even WORST damage!&quot;

Seras expression then changed to confusion as she asked Ramna, &quot;Excuse 
me, but what exactly do you mean by &#39;this form&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just say... it&#39;s complicated,&quot; Ramna answered, feeling a bit 
uneasy. &quot;Besides, I&#39;ll possibly tell you later... if you and your lover 
ever decide to come back again.&quot;

Seras was about to press for more information when Juri got her 
attention. &quot;Oh Seras,&quot; she began, handing the phone, &quot;I think Sir 
Integra wishes to talk to you.&quot;

&quot;Oh thank you,&quot; the Draculina said, taking the phone from Juri. &quot;Yes, 
Sir Integra? What do you want?&quot; she replied to the phone.

&quot;Nothing much,&quot; the Hellsing leader said, &quot;just thanking you for your 
help, that is all. However, there is a... small problem I would like to 
address.&quot;

&quot;A small problem?&quot; Seras echoed.

It took a while before Sir Integra answered, &quot;Yes... and I fear you and 
your fledgling will not like the answer.&quot;

Seras looked uncomfortable. &quot;Is it something we need to return to the 
mansion for?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Well... it&#39;s a bit complicated, so I better explain,&quot; Sir Integra began 
over the receiver.

INSIDE THE LOCKET...

&quot;YOU&#39;VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!?!&quot; Rally H exclaimed, surprised. &quot;YOUR MAY 
AND KENNY... MARRIED!?!?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Rally V answered, taking a sip of her blood. &quot;After Dad sold the 
shop to Roy, May and Kenny decided to tie the knot afterward. The two 
gone into the demolition business and had a bit of success with it. It 
was during their honeymoon trip in Beijing when they got me a present... 
a stuffed panda wearing a Chicago Cubs uniform,&quot; she laughed.

&quot;Naturally,&quot; Misty added, tipping her drink.

&quot;So, my counterpart,&quot; Rally V smirked, &quot;what are you and Misty planning 
for your future?&quot;

Rally H briefly looked up in the air. &quot;You know... I do have 
something... but it&#39;ll have to wait until we can make sure everyone 
won&#39;t duck-out all of a sudden.&quot;

&quot;But if you have anything to surprise me,&quot; Misty added, leaning close, 
&quot;I can be sure I&#39;ll be happy with it!&quot; All three of them laughed, a 
comfort to those who were concerned about what would happen an hour ago.

It was at that point when Seras had returned, a look of concern on her 
face. &quot;Rally,&quot; she began tursly, &quot;we have a problem.&quot;

&quot;A problem?&quot; Rally V repeated, standing up while wearing an alarmed look 
on her face. &quot;What is it, Master... some FREAK on the loose and Integra 
needs us to contain it?&quot;

&quot;Nothing like that,&quot; Seras dismissed. &quot;It&#39;s just that... there&#39;s been a 
slight problem concerning our return. It seems that the people 
calculating the tides on the Thames... miscalculated slightly.&quot;

&quot;How slightly?&quot; the dusky vampire said, looking as if she wasn&#39;t going 
to like the answer.

&quot;Well... we crossed when the tide was about to rise. It&#39;s high tide 
right now, and we can&#39;t cross again without suffering any ill effects,&quot; 
Seras said. &quot;So it looks like we&#39;re going to have to find some sort of 
shelter until the tide recedes... at 5:00 PM tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just great,&quot; Rally V groaned, her shoulders slumping. &quot;And just 
as I was looking forward to seeing my Misty tomorrow.&quot; Then sighing, she 
added, &quot;Well, at least we got our soil packs in the trunk of my car in 
case something like this happens, but I really don&#39;t know if any of the 
hotels around here will be able to take us in.&quot; Then her face lit up, 
&quot;Wait a minute &#150; Misty told me that this place has rooms available, so 
all we have to do is get one for the better part of tomorrow!&quot;

&quot;Why that&#39;s perfect!&quot; Seras beamed. &quot;I&#39;ll go outside and get the packs, 
you make the arrangements for the rooms!&quot;

&quot;Hang on, willya Seras,&quot; Rally H added. &quot;I&#39;ve got to see Hitomi about 
something.&quot; She turned to Misty and said, &quot;It won&#39;t take too long &#150; I 
promise.&quot;

The three soon left the table, with Misty wondering what secret her 
Rally had. &quot;Left alone again,&quot; she mumbled.

Seras, after telling Ramna that she was going to return, made her way to 
the Cobra, keys in her hand, and opened the trunk. But before she could 
extract the packs inside, a familiar voice called out to her. &quot;Miss 
Victoria?&quot;

The Draculina looked up from the trunk. &quot;Walter?&quot; she gasped. She then 
sees Walter C. Dolnez walking towards her, holding what appears to be a 
small case. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

The old butler walked up to Seras, case in hand, and said, &quot;Well, when 
we got word of the tide miscalculation, Sir Integra thought that you and 
Miss Vincent should have a change of clothes while you wait for the tide 
to recede.&quot; He handed the case to the young vampire, &quot;Inside, there are 
a few toiletries, as well as your uniform and a spare outfit for Miss 
Vincent. I trust you were able to contact Sir Integra about your status, 
from what I am able to witness.&quot;

&quot;We have, and don&#39;t worry about me and Rally finding shelter for the 
daylight hours.&quot; Seras thumbed over at the Locket and added, &quot;Seems they 
have a few rooms for rent, so we&#39;ll stay here until tomorrow. You will 
be able to explain this to Misty when she arrives tomorrow?&quot;

Walter nodded, &quot;Indeed we shall.&quot; He then looked over at the door of the 
Locket and saw Ramna, &quot;Thankfully, I will not have to face that little 
lady. The result could have been very ugly.&quot;

Seras also looked back. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t like to see you 
hurt by her.&quot;

Walter then walked away, but not before saying ominously, &quot;Oh I assure 
you I will not be harmed. I was actually worried about HER condition 
after facing me.&quot;

&quot;Uhhh... yeah,&quot; Seras weakly said, absently waving Walter goodbye.

It was a few minutes before everyone returned to the table with Misty. 
Rally V was able to get a room for herself and Seras and had the keys in 
her pocket. However, just as everyone was situated, Rally H got up. 
&quot;Misty,&quot; she began, her dusky skin looking as pale as Rally V&#39;s, 
&quot;there&#39;s been... something I&#39;ve been thinking about but haven&#39;t thought 
of doing it... until tonight. And when I do, you can understand why I&#39;ve 
been avoiding Becky these last couple months.&quot;

&quot;Uh... what are you talking about, Rally?&quot; the former catburgler asked, 
taken somewhat aback.

Rally H then walked next to Misty&#39;s chair, then dropped to one knee in 
front of her. The patrons of the Locket, who were busy with their own 
concerns, dancing and kareoke, took notice and the place grew silent. 
&quot;Misty,&quot; Rally H began, producing a small case, &quot;for the last few 
months, you were the one light that I have in this life... and I&#39;ve been 
avoiding this for all these months. But after seeing her,&quot; nodding to 
Rally V, her voice cracking, &quot;it got me thinking about how uncertain 
life can be... so...&quot; she opened the case, revealing a simple diamond 
ring, &quot;I was wondering... if you&#39;ll allow me to be a part of your 
life... forever.&quot;

Misty&#39;s eyes grew wide, seeing the ring. Then realizing what Rally H was 
asking, tears started streaming from those eyes. Smiling, she tried, but 
without success, to sound clear as she said, &quot;Oh Rally... YES, I 
WILL!!!&quot; She then fiercely hugged Rally H, afterwhich the dusky-skinned 
bounty hunter placed the ring around her finger, all to the wild 
applause of those gathered.

Seras happened to glance over to Rally V, and noticed her fledgling was 
smiling as well, a single bloody tear falling from her eye. &#39;You&#39;re not 
uncomfortable about this?&#39; she asked mentally.

Rally V looked over to Seras and replied, &#39;No Master. In fact... I&#39;m 
happy for the both of them! And after talking to this Misty, I think I 
can find the courage to talk to my Misty.&quot;

All that Seras did was nod and smile.</pre>
