<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 16 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/evatech-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Gendo Ikari paused as he feverishly worked on the
controls of the latest series of Evangelion prototype,
his short black hair falling into his eyes. &quot;You want
me to lecture the pilots on the basics of the
Evangelion technology?&quot; he asked.

Maya Ibuki nodded firmly, for a moment wishing that
Ritsuko could be down there instead of her. &quot;Yes,
sir,&quot; she confirmed, &quot;I believe that Commander Ritsuko
is worried that the pilots are attempting to maintain
their own EVAs, possibly even modifying them.&quot;

&quot;A dangerous idea,&quot; Gendo looked up, his glasses
gleaming, &quot;considering the effects of raw Protoculture
or the Instrumentality components,&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve adopted the enemy&#39;s word for the power cores,&quot;
Maya blinked, &quot;Protoculture?&quot;

&quot;It seems workable, for a word,&quot; Gendo replied
thoughtfully. His labcoat swirled around his legs as
he thought, &quot;All right, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Maya sighed in relief.

&quot;... but I want Shinji, Asuka and Rei there.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Maya looked at Gendo curiously.

Gendo beamed, &quot;So that I can impress them with my
utter brilliance!&quot;

Maya sweatdropped. &#39;Yup, Gendo is really creeping me
out,&#39; she sighed. &quot;All right, we&#39;ll get the meeting
organized in a few days,&quot; she said then all but fled
the room.

A few days later in a conference room of the SDF-1 a
group of impatient pilots sat around, looking rather
bored. &quot;So why are we here again?&quot; Asuka asked, her
orange hair pulled back in a simple but comfortable
ponytail.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Rei answered calmly, her light blue
hair falling into her red eyes as she continued on,
&quot;but I have noticed that almost everyone in this room
has been known to repair systems on their Evangelion
fighters.&quot;

&quot;But I haven&#39;t....&quot; Shinji protested.

&quot;Not me,&quot; Asuka paused as she felt both her wingmen&#39;s
eyes resting on her doubtfully and modified what she
was going to say, &quot;well, not lately, anyway.&quot;

&quot;You are aware it&#39;s against the rules, right?&quot; Shinji
reminded her.

&quot;Of course she knows,&quot; Rei defended Asuka firmly, a
faint blush coloring her cheeks, &quot;she just wants to
have a hands-on knowledge of her EVA.&quot;

Asuka reached out to cover Rei&#39;s hand with her own,
&quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s so sweet,&quot; Hikari sighed from behind them, the
brown haired girl&#39;s hair tied back in it&#39;s usual twin
ponytails.

&quot;Disappointed a few of the single pilots,&quot; Toji
admitted as he casually tried to take a look down the
front of Asuka&#39;s top.

Hikari hit him on the back of the head, &quot;Idiot.&quot;

Aida shook his head mournfully as he sighed, &quot;I wonder
if any of the single men can talk them into
threesomes?&quot;

&quot;Asuka would murder you,&quot; Toji told him seriously.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Aida grinned, &quot;but what a way to go!&quot;

&quot;Idiots,&quot; Hikari sighed again, but she was smiling
slightly.

Maya cleared her throat at the front of the room, the
boyish looking officer announcing, &quot;Gendo Ikari is
here to speak with you.&quot;

Right on cue Gendo burst from the side door, running
inside with his long white lab coat flapping around
his thin body. He stopped by the podium and pushed his
round glasses up smoothly as he said intensely, &quot;Good
afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.&quot; He looked around
then waved spontaneously as he cheerfully called out,
&quot;Hi, Shinji!&quot;

Shinji slumped a bit in his chair, feeling deeply
embarrassed. &quot;Hi, Dad,&quot; he mumbled.

Gendo beamed then instantly went back into serious
mode as he addressed the room, &quot;All right, who can
tell me the origin of the Evangelion?&quot;

There was a moment of dead silence in the room, each
of the pilots waiting for someone else to answer.
Finally Rei raised her hand with a sigh, &quot;I know,
sir.&quot;

Gendo gave her a wry smile, &quot;As we both know.&quot; He
looked around, then just like a school teacher he
instantly narrowed in on the pilot who least wanted to
be called upon and asked, &quot;Toji, would you care to
give it a try?&quot;

The gangly young pilot groaned softly, Toji rising to
his feet reluctantly. &quot;Sir,&quot; he nodded formally, &quot;from
what I understand the Evangelion technology was
developed from the study of the technology of this
ship, which crashed to earth on New Year&#39;s Eve 2000.&quot;

Gendo smiled approvingly, &quot;Simplistic but correct.&quot; He
began to pace restlessly, &quot;The arrival of this ship
was well timed, interrupting a period of dangerous
military adventurism, but what we discovered inside
brought on new problems.&quot;

&quot;A race of alien giants,&quot; Asuka spoke up, &quot;who&#39;s own
records confirmed they were interested only in
conquest.&quot;

&quot;Correct,&quot; Gendo agreed, &quot;we still don&#39;t know what the
race of aliens call themselves or where they come
from, but their military technology was unmatched. The
United Nations established NERV to study and repair
the ship we eventually dubbed the Super Dimensional
Fortress One.&quot;

&quot;Assuming we&#39;ll have a SDF-2 and so on?&quot; Aida offered
hopefully.

&quot;I believe that&#39;s the plan,&quot; Maya nodded.

&quot;What&#39;s this I hear about you and Ritsuko getting
married?&quot; a pilot called from the back row.

&quot;Uhm, I...&quot; Maya&#39;s face went bright red.

Gendo cleared his throat, &quot;Getting back on topic... we
studied tissue samples from the aliens, and using that
along with experimental technologies we crafted the
first Evangelion.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re saying the EVAs are organic?&quot; Hikari asked
disbelievingly.

&quot;Only the core,&quot; Gendo crisply explained, &quot;what we&#39;re
now calling Protoculture, a word provided by our new
adversaries.&quot;

&quot;Protoculture that is surrounded and monitored by
Instrumentality,&quot; Maya added, &quot;that channels the
unique Protoculture energies to the rest of Evangelion
and allows for the transformation from EVA to fighter
mode.&quot;

&quot;So why shouldn&#39;t we repair and maintain our EVAs?&quot;
Shinji asked, knowing that he was practically feeding
his father a straight line.

Gendo flashed a smile for his son then went serious.
&quot;Accidental exposure to Protoculture has unpredictable
effects,&quot; he took off his glasses a moment to reveal
unearthly looking silver eyes, &quot;as you can see.&quot; He
looked regretful, &quot;In the case of my former lab
assistant a more complete change happened, though why
we do not know.&quot;

Rei Ayanami stiffened slightly as he talked, then
seemed to relax a bit when she wasn&#39;t mentioned by
name. Not that her story wasn&#39;t known by most of the
crew anyway, but that didn&#39;t mean she really wanted to
go into it again, either.

&quot;So,&quot; Gendo looked around eagerly, &quot;are they any other
questions?&quot;

There was a moment of silence then Aida piped up,
&quot;Maya, are you going to be entering in the Miss
Macross contest?&quot;

&quot;Ah, I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s really relevant,&quot; Maya
stuttered cutely.

&quot;How about any of the other bridge crew?&quot; another
voice called.

&quot;I don&#39;t really know,&quot; Maya blinked.

&quot;Idiots,&quot; Hikari growled.
