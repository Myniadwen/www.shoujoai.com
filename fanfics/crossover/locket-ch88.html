<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 88 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/locket-ch87.html">Back to Part 87</a><pre>The sixteen year old reddish-brown haired young woman hurried home, her 
heart racing joyfully. &quot;I&#39;m home!&quot; Nanoha Takamachi called out, her long 
ponytail bouncing against her back as she hurried in, taking off her 
shoes at the door.

&quot;Welcome home,&quot; her sister Miyuki called, her short brown hair giving 
her a almost boyishly handsome look. &quot;Is today the big day?&quot; she asked.

Nanoha blushed slightly, &quot;Yes, we&#39;re meeting there later this evening.&quot; 
She walked over, giving her sister a concerned look, &quot;Are mom and dad 
still okay with this?&quot;

Miyuki smiled back comfortingly, &quot;Trust me, they&#39;re fine. It was really 
less of a surprise than when you revealed your magic to them.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Nanoha turned and hurried up the stairs, &quot;Then I&#39;d better 
start getting ready.&quot;

Part of Nanoha was tempted to dress in a variation on what she had first 
worn when they met, but she decided on something a bit more mature. She 
picked out a nice white skirt and matching jacket, wearing a rose shirt 
under that. After a moment&#39;s hesitation she picked up Raging Heart on 
it&#39;s special chain and hung it around her neck. She didn&#39;t expect to 
need it, but she wanted to be ready.

&quot;When should I tell them you&#39;ll be back?&quot; Miyuki asked, smiling as 
Nanoha hurried back down stairs.

Nanoha paused at the door as she slipped a set of dress shoes on. &quot;Not 
till later,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;ll phone if I&#39;m really late.&quot;

&quot;Have fun,&quot; Miyuki nodded as Nanoha left. Quietly she murmured to 
herself, &quot;Looks like my little sister is all grown up.&quot;

Meanwhile, the nightclub Arisugawa&#39;s Locket was already jumping. A line 
up of young women waited , talking together and gathering together in 
the spring chill. Signum Needes looked cool and composed in a simple 
pants and jacket combo, her pink hair flowing down over her shoulders in 
a ponytail. Beside her Shamal smiled in her long dress, her blonde hair 
framing kind eyes as she talked to Ishida, the other woman casually 
standing close by. Not far away Hayate Yagami and Vita talked, both 
young women laughing softly.

&quot;I still find it hard to accept,&quot; Ishida admitted, &quot;thought learning 
about the magic explained a great deal.&quot; She gave all of them a scolding 
look, &quot;Like why medicine wouldn&#39;t help Hayate.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not all their fault,&quot; Hayate spoke up, her brown hair falling into 
her eyes, &quot;they didn&#39;t know my illness was caused by the book.&quot;

Shamal put her hand on Ishida&#39;s shoulder as she smiled warmly, &quot;And if 
it hadn&#39;t been for that we&#39;d never have met.&quot;

Ishida blushed even as Vita rolled her eyes. &quot;Mushy stuff,&quot; the little 
girl muttered, shaking her head as her red braid bounced. &quot;Too bad 
Zafira can&#39;t come,&quot; she added.

&quot;I understand men are forbidden here,&quot; Signum noted coolly. Around her 
neck her sword amulet dangled, much like the ones her comrades Shamal 
and Vita had.

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to this,&quot; Hayate agreed, a smile teasing her lips. 
There was a interesting aura between her and her three knights, a sense 
of tenderness and caring.

A redheaded woman stood by the door, checking Ids with a cheerful smile. 
Midori Sugiura nodded to the group of them, looking them over. She 
frowned at Hayate and Vita, &quot;Can I see your Ids?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m immortal,&quot; Vita muttered with a sigh, &quot;and I&#39;ll get carded 
forever.&quot;

Hayate nodded to Midori, &quot;I&#39;m underage, but I&#39;m being escorted by my 
friends.&quot; Wryly she added, &quot;I&#39;m sure they have no intention of letting 
me drink.&quot;

&quot;You may be our master,&quot; Shamal noted with a smile, &quot;but drinking is 
very bad for someone your age.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Ishida agreed.

&quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Alpha smiled, the green haired coffee 
shop owner having taken up greeting duties that day.

Meanwhile, in a apartment in another part of Tokyo a blonde haired woman 
fretted as she turned in front of the mirror. &quot;Does this look good, 
Bardiche?&quot; Fate Testarossa Harlaown asked, looking as her black pants 
and jacket, all trimmed in gold.

&quot;You look fine, Sir,&quot; Bardiche answered with his usual formality, the 
triangle shaped device sitting on the dresser.

&quot;Yes, you do,&quot; the other woman&#39;s voice noted, her voice kind. Fate 
turned to see Lindy Harlaown looking at her with a slight smile, the 
green haired woman adding, &quot;I came up to remind you it&#39;s nearly time to 
go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Mother&quot; Fate said as she picked up Bardiche and put it in a 
inner pocket of her jacket.

Lindy walked over to put a comforting hand on her shoulder as she said, 
&quot;You really don&#39;t need to be nervous, Fate.&quot;

Fate gave her adopted mother a sad smile, &quot;After Nanoha got hurt, I 
realized I needed to let her know how I feel.&quot; She sighed, &quot;But this is 
our first date....&quot;

Lindy surprised her with a hug, then let her go. &quot;She loves you,&quot; she 
told Fate firmly, &quot;it&#39;ll be all right.&quot;

Fate blushed then she hugged Lindy back. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said then 
turned to the door, &quot;and I&#39;d better get going.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Lindy called as Fate activated Bardiche and soared off into 
the evening sky.

Nanoha smiled as she hurried up to the bar, coming up behind another of 
her friends. Suzuka Tsukimura turned, her purple hair shining as she 
hugged Nanaho and said, &quot;I thought you&#39;d never get here.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nanaho chuckled, &quot;I tried to hurry but I didn&#39;t want to use 
magic to get here.&quot; She looked a bit nervous, &quot;Is Fate here?&quot;

Suzuka looked up, her eyes widening, &quot;I think that&#39;s her now.&quot;

Shimmering gold wings glowed on Fate&#39;s boots as she descended from the 
sky, her expression rather sheepish. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said as she landed, 
the wings disappearing and Bardiche&#39;s scythe mode reverting to a amulet.

&quot;I thought we weren&#39;t going to use magic,&quot; Nanoha scolded even as she 
rushed to hug Fate close to her.

Fate let her arms wrap around Nanoha, holding her close tenderly even as 
she felt the love she carried for her well up. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she repeated 
with a lopsided smile.

Suzuka laughed softly as she said, &quot;You two are making a scene.&quot; She 
smiled as she gently added, &quot;Can we please head inside?&quot;

&quot;Lets,&quot; Nanoha agreed, keeping a arm around Fate.

Within the bar women chatted and danced happily, swaying to the pounding 
beat of the music. Off to one side the library was filled with people 
reading and talking, while up at the bar women vied for the attention of 
the bartenders and posed prettily for each other.

Hitomi smiled as the brown haired part time waitress lead the three to 
the table their friends were at. &quot;I hope you&#39;ll have a good time,&quot; she 
said warmly, &quot;just signal a waitress if you need anything.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Fate nodded happily.

&quot;Suzuka,&quot; Hayate cried as she looked up happily, getting up to draw the 
other woman close. They kissed a bit shyly under the other&#39;s gazes, then 
Suzuka drew her close, kissing her a bit more eagerly.

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you,&quot; Suzuka sighed happily as they finally parted.

Hayate blushed a bit, her gaze tender and loving. &quot;I&#39;m sorry my work has 
been keeping me away,&quot; she apologized as they all sat down.

Suzuka put her hand over Hayate&#39;s, squeezing it softly. &quot;I understand, 
Hayate, believe me,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;It&#39;s hard to believe this started from a few library meetings,&quot; Signum 
noted as they greeted their friends.

&quot;Thanks for saving us a table,&quot; Nanoha said, sitting down beside Fate on 
one end, the couple of Shamal and Ishida, Vita and Signum then Hayate 
and Suzuka.

They talked happily and ate eagerly, drinking cautiously and taking 
turns to get up and go out on the dance floor. Shamal and Ishida swayed 
together gracefully while Suzuka and Hayate danced more energetically. 
Surprisingly Signum was approached by several ladies and danced, even as 
Vita scowled in her seat.

&quot;More food?&quot; Mahoro asked, the black haired android dressed in a typical 
black and white maid&#39;s uniform. &quot;Drink refills?&quot;

&quot;Not for me,&quot; Nanoha said as she got up, offering Fate her hand.

Fate got up, the two walking out to the dance floor. &quot;Nanoha,&quot; Fate 
murmured as they slow danced. She swallowed, summoning her courage, 
&quot;I&#39;ve wanted to sat this to you for a long time... I love you.&quot;

Nanoha let her head rest on Fate&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I&#39;ve loved you almost as 
long as I&#39;ve known you, fate.&quot;

&quot;Will you.... be with me? Forever?&quot; Fate asked as she looked down at 
Nanoha.

&quot;Always,&quot; Nanoha agreed, kissing her again, tenderly.
