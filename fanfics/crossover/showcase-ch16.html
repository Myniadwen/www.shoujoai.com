Artemis smiled as the tall, brown haired warrior stood
by one of the great buildings on Paradise Island,
looking up to the sky patiently. Her toga like garb
swirled around her legs, her body athletic and strong.
As the figure descended from the blue sky she called,
&#147;Welcome home, Donna Troy.&#148;

Donna Troy, the sister of Diana and former princess of
the island touched down beside her gracefully, her
short black hair swirling around her face. Her own
expression was somewhat more grave as she said, &#147;I&#146;m
sorry it&#146;s business that brings me home now.&#148;

Artemis held up a hand, &#147;You don&#146;t need to explain,
the United Nations has already issued an appeal for
all nations to offer assistance in this current
crisis.&#148;

&#147;Thank Athena,&#148; Donna sighed. She wore street clothes,
a T-shirt and jeans along with a plain blue jacket and
leather boots, a combination that looked quite good on
the slim young woman. &#147;I have information for you,&#148;
Donna added, reaching into her coat and drawing out
several documents.

&#147;Then it&#146;s best we shared it,&#148; Artemis said. They
walked into the building together as she added, &#147;Nice
clothes.&#148;

Donna blushed faintly, knowing that residents of the
island disapproved of modern clothes. &#147;Things were
sufficiently urgent that it seemed a waste to change,&#148;
she admitted.

Artemis raised her eyebrows as they strode the halls
of the roman style villa then out into a larger room.
&#147;When Circe talked to the American ambassador it
didn&#146;t come across as quite so urgent,&#148; she said with
a frown.

&#147;Bruce is doing his best to hammer the urgency of this
into the President,&#148; Donna made a face, &#147;but some
officials in his administration think that this is all
a stunt of some kind.&#148;

&#147;Even with their own telescopes showing that Warworld
is coming?&#148; Artemis sounded surprised anyone could be
so blind.

&#147;Politics,&#148; Donna shrugged in explanation as they
moved through a second chamber. &#147;Oh,&#148; she remembered
something else important, &#147;Bruce privately told me he
knows about Harley and Ivy being offered citizenship
on the island.&#148;

Artemis grimaced a bit, &#147;How angry is he?&#148;

&#147;Not that bad, actually,&#148; Donna mused, &#147;I think he&#146;s
happier having both of them here so that the Amazons
can keep them out of trouble.&#148;

&#147;Easier said than done,&#148; Artemis chuckled softly as
they reached a inner door. &#147;I called our war council
together when I heard you were coming, that
includes...&#148;

&#147;Circe,&#148; Donna nodded, &#147;it&#146;s all right, Artemis. We
buried the hatchet long ago.&#148;

&#147;Good enough,&#148; and Athena pushed open the door.

Conversation around the table barely stopped as the
women standing there noted the two women&#146;s arrival.
Liri Lee bent over a table studying world maps, the
former time traveler&#146;s cyborg body gleaming beneath
her robes. Circe was talking to Ivy and Harley, the
purple haired sorceress&#146; expression faintly amused.
Lady Marvel&#146;s brown hair looked beautiful as the red
and gold clad figure smiled in welcome. Finally Donna
saw a figure who made her catch her breath, Raven
Azarath, the black haired woman looking up with a shy
smile hello. All of these women had made Paradise
their home over the years, and in return for that
hospitality they offered their help in times of need.

&#145;Which this certainly is now,&#146; Donna admitted.

&#147;Welcome back, Troia,&#148; Circe said with a slightly
remote smile on her face.

&#147;How&#146;s your daughter?&#148; Donna asked, knowing from past
experience that was a perfect way to charm the other
woman.

Circe chuckled, &#147;Lyta has her first girlfriend, it
seems.&#148;

&#147;That must be fun,&#148; Donna joined in the fond laughter.

&#147;All right everyone,&#148; Athena said crisply, &#147;Donna&#146;s
arrived with more information for our informal
alliance.&#148;

Taking out the documents she had obtained Donna moved
to lay them out on the table. &#147;The latest hard data
the Justice League has,&#148; she said, &#147;along with the
D.E.O., Checkmate and other agencies. We&#146;ve also
tossed in our best guesses as to what we might expect,
based on prior encounters with alien species.&#148;

&#147;Summary?&#148; Liri Lee asked thoughtfully, bending over
to study the papers intently.

&#147;Warworld arrives in a week or so,&#148; Donna said
frankly, &#147;and armed to the teeth with alien weapons.
They have Thangar, Khund and other species as foot
soldiers, and data collected from the first wave of
alien refuges implies that they have a race leading
them that is at least Superman-classed in power.&#148;

&#147;We have fighters that can match Superman, too,&#148; Ivy
nodded to Lady Marvel, the redheaded plant mistress
sticking close to Harley&#146;s side.

&#147;Thank you,&#148; Lady Marvel said warmly, &#147;but we of the
Marvel Family have always had magic to help, too.&#148;

&#147;Any luck getting Shazam himself involved?&#148; Artemis
asked.

&#147;He won&#146;t intervene in mortal matters, not any more,&#148;
Marvel shook her head regretfully.

&#147;So why are Red an&#146; I here?&#148; Harley asked curiously,
chewing gum.

&#147;I asked for you to be here,&#148; Artemis smiled, &#147;because
I&#146;m hoping you two and Circe can put out a call to
arms in the criminal underworld.&#148;

&#147;Seriously?&#148; Ivy blinked, looking intrigued.

&#147;It... might be worth pursuing,&#148; Circe admitted after
a moment. &#147;I know at least some criminals won&#146;t care,
but the majority are at least interested in self
preservation. We can rally them using their own self
interest.&#148;

Donna looked up to see Raven giving her a searching
look, then the black haired woman quietly slipped out
of the room. Making an instant decision Donna turned
to the group, &#147;I&#146;ll leave you to go over the data for
awhile... I need some air.&#148; With that she moved off
confidently, slipping out the door to the meditation
space maintained outside.

Standing amid the greenery Raven&#146;s black cloak swirled
around her legs, her simple blue jumpsuit hugging her
slim form. She looked between nineteen and twenty five
but in truth was ageless, much like Donna herself.
&#147;Donna?&#148; she sounded surprised.

&#147;Are you all right?&#148; Donna asked as she moved over to
Raven&#146;s side.

&#147;I should be asking you that,&#148; Raven reached out to
gently touch Donna&#146;s arm, &#147;you must be so worried
about your sister.&#148;

&#147;You picked up on that with your empathy?&#148; Donna asked
softly.

&#147;No,&#148; Raven squeezed comfortingly, &#147;because I know
you.&#148;

&#147;Thank you,&#148; Donna sighed happily. They stood there in
comfortable silence for a long moment, a slight blush
coloring Donna&#146;s cheeks. &#147;And how about you?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine,&#148; Raven reassured her warmly, &#147;I didn&#146;t mean
to worry you.&#148; She paused a moment, &#147;I didn&#146;t mean to
intrude, but I felt such a spike of... joy when you
entered the room. Who did that to you?&#148;

Donna bit down a moment of stark terror. &#145;Thank god
she can&#146;t read minds,&#146; Donna thought as she answered,
&#147;Just glad to see a old friend.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m glad to have you here, too, no matter the
circumstances,&#148; Raven said as she put her head on
Donna&#146;s shoulder. &#145;Playing dumb about her feelings is
getting harder than I thought,&#146; Raven mused, &#145;I hope
she decides to tell me soon.&#146;

To be continued...

Notes: As a long time fan of the Titans I should note
there&#146;s only a tiny degree of subtext between the two
of them. They clearly are quite good friends, but
romance has eluded them for the time being. Artemis,
Harley and Ivy were all featured in my last Paradise
Island chapter, and I mentioned Circe being ambassador
of the island earlier, too.</pre>
