<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Murder&quot; cried Angelica &quot; murder and treason.&quot; 

The castle panicked. They dumped their party as they went to the second 
chamber; Marth king of Hyrule laid bleeding gallons of blood on the 
floor. Rage gasped in disgrace. 

&quot; Get forensics and scientists in&quot; Rage roared &quot; a murder as bloody as 
this. Find the culprit and publicly slaughter it &quot; 

Then Shelito Paz walked in with even worse news 

&quot; Angelica&quot; Paz announced, &quot; I&#39;m sorry but your son Garnet and his 
friend Shyst Winstrate has been sliced in half&quot; 

Angelica broke down in tears Roy her remaining son on her right side. 
Zelda walked normally around the castle then was stunned to see every 
one bow at her. Then over their shoulders she noticed her brother dead 
by a bloody death. 

&quot; I am Queen of Hyrule&quot; Zelda whispered, &quot; I will not be crowned as 
queen,&quot; Zelda shed a tear &quot; until the murderer of my brother is caught.&quot; 

&quot; Make way, make way,&quot; cried the voices of the police as pieces of the 
press came in.
