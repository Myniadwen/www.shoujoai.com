<h1>Jetiendo (part 28 of 38)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>Kari was outside with Misty, they only been friends for a few weeks but 
it felt like forever could it be that she was homosexual, like her 
brother, it was the perfect opportunity to have an affair, She knew she 
didn&#39;t want TK anymore she wanted Misty, was she or wasn&#39;t she a 
lesbian? She didn&#39;t know. But she talked as a best friend would. Misty 
had a pregnancy test in her hand; Kari and Misty told virtually 
everything to each over,

&quot;Better to be safe than sorry,&quot; Misty whispered,

Kari stood their at a froze, she may be a lesbian, or bisexual, pregnant 
no way! But she acted normally

&quot;I&#39;ll check later&quot; Kari replied, &quot;I will this time&quot; Kari fell into tears 
looking at the 16 year old weirdly,

&quot;Kari,&quot; Misty said softly as she hugged her &quot;what&#39;s wrong&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m scared&quot; Kari whispered, &quot;you know when TK slapped me across the 
face, &quot; thinking of the first thing that came into her mind &quot;I&#39;m worried 
what else he might do to me&quot; that is only part of the story I don&#39;t love 
TK anymore I love you misty but I cant say it on Christmas, any way my 
brother Tai is in love with Matt it might hurt him.

&quot;Why did you get back with him in the first place?&quot; Misty asked, what 
the bloody hell am I doing I&#39;m turning into a lesbian, she&#39;s straight 
for god&#39;s sake

&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; Kari said &quot;I thought he was just effected by alcohol and 
got drunk but then I noticed, he&#39;s not that sweet guy people know him as 
now I ...&quot; Kari was just about to confess her feelings to Misty,

&quot;Kari its Christmas day worry about this on boxing day&quot; Misty smiled at 
her as she dried her tears and ran away. I didn&#39;t want to hear that, I 
think I already know what it is,

Kari watched her than spotted her brother and rushed to her in her usual 
happy mode

Kari looked at her gutted brother, Matt and him had split up now. As 
they walked in the deserted street of Jetiendo, Misty sat on the bench, 
Kari burst out of her pocket looking for a fiver,

&quot;Tai, here&#39;s a fiver&quot; Kari said giving the fiver to him, &quot;go and spend 
it on your own&quot;

&quot;Ok&quot; Tai said, as he snatched the fiver from her and left, Kari sat next 
to Misty, Kari took out the pregnancy test, the lights where blue, the 
impossible news had arrived she was pregnant. Misty turned around as 
Kari stuck her head down.

&quot; Kari...&quot; Misty said to her trying to find the problem, the blue lights 
said it all, &quot;sorry u really thought you wasn&#39;t pregnant,&quot; Misty let her 
feelings get he better of her she tried to hug Kari, instead it was a 
kiss using tongue. Misty stopped ashamed of what she&#39;s done, the best 
five seconds of her life turned into the worst Christmas of her life. 
Kari grabbed her by the top and kissed her with obsession. They where 
both speechless they where both turned into lesbians,

&quot;That felt good,&quot; Kari whispered as her head rested on her back. &quot;I 
thought I was straight until now&quot; Misty whispered, &quot; Actually I had a 
huge crush on you,&quot;

&quot; I had a super crush on you&quot; Kari breathed.

&quot;What ya gonna do about TK?&quot;

&quot;Keep it quiet to him&quot; Kari whistled, &quot;After the baby&#39;s born.&quot;

&quot;Who ya gonna tell about our lesbianship&quot; Misty asked hastily

&quot;No one&quot; Kari said stroking Misty&#39;s shoulders &quot;who cares if someone 
catches us I love you more than anything I don&#39;t give a shit what the 
people say.&quot;

Misty fell into another kiss, has the devil of homosexuality cast a 
spell on them? Or has the cupids accepted the facts? Either way, there 
was a long marathon of questions zoomed inside their brains giving them 
both headaches as they kiss the questions have their answers.
