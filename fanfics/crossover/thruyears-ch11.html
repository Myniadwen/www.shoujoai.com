<a href="../crossover/thruyears-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>O&#39;HARE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, COMMERCIAL TERMINAL, THE NEXT NIGHT...
 
Rally Vincent stood with her back to the tarmac at the airport&#39;s 
commercial terminal, looking forlornly at the brightly-lit sight of the 
Chicago skyline.  She had made the decision the night before to leave 
the city she loved - mostly because two days before she had died, only 
to be reborn as a vampire - and because she was a vampire, she made the 
choice to go to London rather than place her friends in danger from the 
Hellsing Organization&#39;s enemy Iscariot - and from herself.  &#39;This might 
be the last time for at least a few months I get to see this,&#39; she 
thought to herself.  &#39;Already, I&#39;m beginning to miss it.&#39;
 
&quot;Hey Rally,&quot; Roy Coleman called out from behind her.  &quot;Whatcha doing?  
Saying your last goodbyes to Chicago?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah... I guess, Roy,&quot; Rally sighed.  Looking at her old friend, her 
red eyes seemed to betray a little sadness.  &quot;It&#39;s funny, looking at the 
skyline like this... I always thought I was going to be a part of this 
city forever.&quot;  She then chuckled humorlessly, &quot;Fancy that... &#39;forever&#39; 
seems to me my state of being now... forever young, forever beautiful... 
while everyone I will ever know will be gone.  Even if I should return 
to Chicago for good in the future... nothing will be the same as I had 
left it the first time.&quot;  A single bloody tear rolled down Rally&#39;s 
cheek, quickly daubed away by Coleman.
 
&quot;Look... Rally... I don&#39;t want you to get all blubbery right now, you&#39;ll 
stain your blouse,&quot; Coleman reassured.
 
&quot;Sorry, Roy... I just can&#39;t help it.  I jumped into this... becoming a 
vampire... without thinking things through and... I&#39;m just have to 
except the facts,&quot; Rally said.
 
Coleman nodded, and then decided to change the subject.  &quot;Have you 
talked to your father yet, Rally?&quot; he asked.
 
&quot;Oh... yeah, before coming out here,&quot; answered Rally.  &quot;Integra 
beforehand told him about what had happened, so he knew what to expect.&quot;
 
&quot;And what did he say... about you as a vampire?&quot;
 
Rally looked up before answering.  &quot;Well... it wasn&#39;t exactly what he 
expected... him having a vampire for a daughter.  However, he 
understood, and he&#39;s looking forward to seeing me once he settles 
business over here... which reminds me...&quot;  She then produced a small 
laminated card and handed it to Coleman.
 
&quot;Your bounty hunting license?&quot; asked Coleman.
 
Rally nodded.  &quot;I won&#39;t be needing it anymore, since I&#39;m going to be 
working for Hellsing.  And speaking of such, what did you tell your wife 
about me leaving, Roy?&quot;
 
&quot;Nothing much,&quot; Coleman began, &quot;just that Sir Integra offered you a 
position within her business, which would offer you a bit more security 
moneywise.  I didn&#39;t give her the full story, though... didn&#39;t think she 
deserved to know the truth.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks, Roy.&quot; 
 
The two continued to look at the skyline for a few minutes before a 
familiar voice called out, &quot;Hey Rally... whatcha doin&#39;?
 
Rally and Coleman turned around to see &#39;Minnie&#39; May Hopkins and Becky 
&#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah walking up to them.  &quot;Yeah Rally,&quot; Becky asked, 
picking up from May&#39;s earlier outburst, &quot;you&#39;re not thinking of leaving 
with saying goodbye to us?&quot;
 
&quot;Please guys don&#39;t say that,&quot; Rally replied.  &quot;Right now I really like 
the word &#39;goodbye&#39;.  I&#39;ll be back to visit - I&#39;ve got Integra&#39;s word on 
it.&quot;  She then turned to Becky and added, &quot;So, is everything taken care 
of?&quot;
 
&quot;Sure thing,&quot; said Becky, adjusting her glasses.  &quot;The hard part is 
finding enough boxes to have all your guns packed.  Sir Integra&#39;s 
already made arrangements to have the smaller firearms and the Cobra 
shipped out with you tonight, with the larger pieces later on in the 
month.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks, Becky.  As soon as I get myself settled in London, I&#39;ll email 
you my address so that everybody can keep in touch,&quot; Rally said.  She 
then looked to May and added, &quot;May, Dad&#39;s going to come by and help you 
out in the shop.  It&#39;ll be for a few months before he can sell it, but 
at least it&#39;ll give you time to find another job with Kenny.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; May quipped, but then looked uncomfortable with her next 
words, &quot;Rally, I... I wish you didn&#39;t have to do this.&quot;
 
&quot;Same here, but it&#39;s for the best.  At least I can learn from Alucard 
and Seras on how to use my vampire powers more effectively, not to 
mention controlling my thirst better.&quot;  She then hugged May, careful not 
to crush her and further added, &quot;Look May, promise me one thing.&quot;
 
&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;
 
&quot;That you and Kenny get married soon.  I don&#39;t know... you might call it 
a vampire&#39;s intuition... but I&#39;ve got a feeling you and him are going to 
be a big thing in this town.&quot;
 
&quot;Right!&quot; May laughed, hugging Rally in return.
 
&quot;Excuse me, Miss Vincent,&quot; Walter C. Dolnez&#39;s voice called out from a 
distance.  Everyone tuned to see the old butler striding ever so rapidly 
on them.  &quot;I believe it is time for you to get ready.  If you could 
follow me...&quot;
&quot;Okay Walter, I&#39;m coming, just give me a few minutes,&quot; growled Rally, 
sounding a little annoyed.  Walter nodded and stood his place.  Turning 
back to her friends, she said, &quot;Looks like I better get on the plane.  
I&#39;m really going to miss you guys.&quot;
 
Then Coleman, Becky and May gave Rally a hug, which lasted for a few 
minutes.  After then broke up, Coleman then reached into the bag he had 
been carrying.  &quot;Before you go, Rally, we thought you might need this 
for the trip.&quot;
 
&quot;I wonder what it is?&quot; Rally said to herself as she took what Coleman 
handed her - an insulated container.  Looking inside, she gasped as she 
saw three transfusion packs of blood, the names &#39;Roy&#39;, &#39;Becky&#39; and &#39;May&#39; 
hand-written on them.  Looking at her friends, she saw them roll-up 
their coat sleeves as one to reveal the bandages on their arms.  &quot;You 
guys...&quot; she choked, again daubing her eyes, &quot;... you shouldn&#39;t have...&quot;
 
&quot;It was my idea,&quot; Becky said.  &quot;Rally... even if we get separated by 
time, this is one way we can all be together.  Even after the blood is 
gone, a part of us will always be with you.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Rally sniffled, excepting a new tissue from Coleman.
 
&quot;Take care, Rally,&quot; Coleman said, waving at his friend.  Becky and May 
waved in turn, and then walked away.
 
Walter made his way over to Rally.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry, Miss Vincent.  
Sir Integra has already made plans in the future for you to visit them,&quot; 
he reassured, then checked his watch and added, &quot;We had better get 
ready.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay,&quot; Rally whispered as she watched her friends walk away, then 
turned around and followed.
 
XXX
 
&quot;Welcome aboard Alitalia Flight 750, with non-stop service to Rome, 
Italy,&quot; the flight attendant said over the public address system onboard 
the Airbus jetliner taxing out of the passenger terminal onto the 
runway.  As she continued to make her pre-flight briefing to the 
passengers, Paladin Alexander Anderson casually looked out from the 
magazine he was reading to the commercial terminal, and frowned as he 
caught sight of an R.A.F. cargo jet parked there.  No doubt the Hellsing 
Organization was making its preparations to return to England - with an 
extra vampire onboard it. 
 
&#39;This is a bad sign,&#39; he thought to himself.  &#39;Hellsing&#39;s got itself 
another unholy bloodsucker within England&#39;s shores.  Section XIII will 
have to monitor this carefully.&#39;  He then smiled to himself, &#39;However... 
Ah have t&#39; admit Rally Vincent is one fighter Ah look forward t&#39; facing 
again.  Even with me holy blade within her, she never backed down or 
showed fear in the least.  And even with me blade burning in her cursed 
hand; she faced me down with it and gave me a good one!  Who knows... 
once Ah take care of Alucard, Ah might give her another go at it.&#39;
 
&quot;Excuse me, Father,&quot; the flight attendant said, drawing Anderson from 
his thoughts, &quot;but we&#39;re about to take off.  If you would buckle 
yourself in, we can proceed.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank ye, me child.  Ah&#39;ll be doin&#39; just that,&quot; Anderson pleasantly 
said, buckling himself in.  As the jet began its acceleration for take 
off, he thought to himself again, &#39;Ah&#39;ll be looking forward t&#39; our next 
battle, Rally Vincent.&#39;
 
COMMERCIAL TERMINAL, NEAR AN R.A.F. TRANSPORT...
 
&quot;Make sure that car is carefully secured,&quot; Sir Integra Fairbrook 
Wingates Hellsing called out to the men inside the cargo hold of the 
transport, where they were securing Rally&#39;s Cobra for the flight.  &quot;I do 
not want it scratched at all or you are paying for the repair!&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; one of them called back.
 
Satisfied about the progress, the Hellsing leader paced across the 
tarmac, awaiting a chance to board for home.  Then something caught her 
eye - namely Seras Victoria, who was standing near a wall.  &quot;I am amazed 
that you have not gotten ready yet,&quot; she began.  &quot;Alucard is already in 
his coffin and onboard.  I figured you have done the same.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh not yet, Sir Integra,&quot; the Draculina answered, turning around.  
&quot;There are still a few things I need to take care of before we do.&quot;  
Then standing close to the Hellsing leader, she added, &quot;I was 
wondering... are you certain it&#39;s alright... me and Rally together?&quot;
 
&quot;Of course, Seras dear,&quot; Sir Integra said warmly, giving Seras a kiss on 
the forehead.  &quot;I said it before, I love you... but my duties to Her 
Majesty preclude us engaging in any romantic interests I may have.&quot;  She 
sighed, &quot;And I believe Rally may need your help more than ever.  You and 
Alucard have to aid her if she is to survive among other humans.&quot;
 
&#39;I wouldn&#39;t worry, Seras,&#39; Alucard&#39;s voice sounded within Seras&#39; mind.  
&#39;Rally Vincent has more than enough common sense within her, so teaching 
her should be a breeze.&#39;
 
&quot;Excuse me, Integra,&quot; Seras told Sir Integra, then mentally answered, 
&#39;Thank you, Master.  But there&#39;s one think I like to ask of you.&#39;
 
&#39;And what is it?&#39;
 
Seras smiled as she composed her next message, &#39;Ever since you&#39;ve freed 
me, you haven&#39;t since then called me &#39;Police Girl&#39;.&#39;
 
&#39;I though you hated that name, Seras.&#39;
 
&#39;That was before, when I was first turned,&#39; Seras answered.  &#39;I still 
call you &#39;Master&#39;, do I?  I guess every once-in-a-while you might call 
me that... for old time&#39;s sake.&#39;
 
&#39;I guess it wouldn&#39;t hurt to do so... Police Girl,&#39; Alucard smirked, 
causing Seras to smile.  &#39;Now I suggest you attend to the business you 
waited for.&#39;
 
&#39;Right.  Later, Master.&#39;  Turning her attention back to Sir Integra, 
Seras then said, &quot;Sorry about that, Master was talking.  I was wondering 
if you might accompany me for a bit?&quot;
 
&quot;Why whatever for?&quot; Sir Integra asked.
 
&quot;I&#39;ll explain while we&#39;re on the way,&quot; Seras replied, taking Sir 
Integra&#39;s hand into her&#39;s as they proceeded to another part of the 
terminal.
 
AT THE SAME TIME...
 
&quot;W-W-W-WALTER!?!?&quot; Rally sputtered, pointing a trembling finger, &quot;WHAT 
THE HELL IS THAT?!?!?!&quot;
 
Walter was a little puzzled about Rally&#39;s reaction as he stood next to 
the huge crate.  &quot;Why this is your accommodations for the trip, Miss 
Vincent.  I was certain you were aware of this.&quot; 
 
&quot;Y-Y-YOU MEAN... I&#39;M GOING TO BE SPENDING THE ENTIRE TRIP IN A BOX!?!?&quot; 
Rally yelled.
 
&quot;Well... it was the best we could do under such short notice,&quot; Walter 
replied, a little unconcerned about Rally&#39;s outburst.  &quot;We couldn&#39;t 
obtain a coffin without having to ask any awkward questions about the 
reasons.&quot;
 
&quot;A-a coffin?&quot; groaned Rally.  
 
&quot;Please, let me explain.  It might ease your mind if you know the 
reasons.&quot;  Walter cleared his throat before he began, &quot;We will be 
traveling by air over several large bodies of water, which would include 
Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Atlantic 
Ocean, all of which can be very painful or terminal for new vampires 
like yourself.  The safest way for any vampire to travel in such 
circumstances is to sleep within a coffin with at least of a pound of 
the soil of their birthplace inside, which in your case would be 
England.&quot;
 
&quot;You mean... there&#39;s a bag of dirt inside that crate?&quot; Rally said, 
already not liking what she was hearing.  
 
Walter placed a reassuring hand on Rally&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;I know it is not 
pleasant, but even a vampire like Alucard has to abide by these 
constraints or face an uncomfortable journey.  Don&#39;t worry; I made sure 
that the crate was well-padded as not to jostle you unnecessarily.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks, Walter,&quot; Rally sighed.  &quot;You know... I was really hoping for a 
window seat, but I know you were only trying to help me out.&quot;  She 
looked inside the crate, and satisfied with what she saw, leapt inside.  
&quot;I guess I&#39;ll see you once we reach Heathrow.&quot;
 
&quot;I still have other things to do before we take off,&quot; Walter replied, 
&quot;so I might be back to make sure the lid is secured before you are 
loaded onboard.  Please try to be comfortable until then.&quot;  He then set 
the lid down.
 
Although it was totally dark inside the crate, Rally could easily make 
out the inside.  The sides were padded, and she could clearly see the 
small bag of English soil at her feet.  However, this didn&#39;t make the 
sudden feeling of loneliness she had felt go away.  &#39;Why am I feeling 
like this?&#39; she thought to herself sadly, trying to hold back the bloody 
tears that welled in her eyes.  &#39;Is this what it means to be a 
vampire... knowing that everyone you&#39;ll ever know will die, with you 
left behind?&#39;
 
Suddenly, the lid opened.  Rally was about to let some hapless 
crewmember receive a tongue-lashing for interrupting her sour mood when 
she looked up - and saw Seras and Sir Integra looking on.  &quot;Oh,&quot; she 
blundered, trying to wipe the tears from her eyes, &quot;Master, Sir Integra.  
What are you doing here?&quot;
 
&quot;Well for one thing,&quot; Seras said, &quot;you could make a little room.&quot;  
Before Rally could say anything, the Draculina jumped inside the crate 
and set herself next to Rally.  &quot;A little snug, but I think we can 
adjust.&quot;
 
&quot;Er... Master, what are you doing?&quot; Rally asked, finding herself being 
pressed against Seras&#39; breasts.  &quot;Really, I appreciate the company, but 
don&#39;t you have your own coffin to ride in?&quot;
 
&quot;Relax, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra answered.  &quot;Seras explained to me that you 
might be feeling out-of-sorts during the trip and offered to ride with 
you back to England.&quot;
 
&quot;But Integra,&quot; Rally sputtered, &quot;there&#39;s hardly any room in here for me 
and Master.  What makes you think...&quot; But before she could add any more, 
the lid closed again, this time the sound of nails being hammered was 
heard.  &quot;Great.  She had this timed right.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh I wouldn&#39;t too sour about this arrangement, Rally,&quot; Seras purred, 
maneuvering herself so that she was on top of Rally.  &quot;At least Sir 
Integra approves of us being together.&quot;  She then kissed Rally briefly 
on the lips and added, &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not just Integra that I&#39;m in love 
with.&quot;
 
Sighing, Rally had to concede with the situation and embraced her 
master.  &quot;I guess I can get used to it.&quot;  She then drew Seras into 
another, more lingering kiss.  &#39;Although,&#39; she mentally added, &#39;I don&#39;t 
think we&#39;ll have much room for sex in here.&#39;
 
&#39;I think it&#39;s a little soon for that right now,&#39; Seras added, &#39;although 
I wouldn&#39;t mind a little fondling and cuddling.&#39;  She then gently 
squeezed Rally&#39;s right breast in her left hand, causing her to moan 
sensually.
 
&#39;I think I wouldn&#39;t mind that,&#39; Rally said, returning the gesture to 
Seras.
 
Several hours later, Rally and Seras&#39; crate was finally loaded on board 
the transport, which began to taxi down the runway for the trip to 
England.  The sun was finally beginning its accent from the east when 
the jet finally took off.  
 
Inside the crate, Seras laid on top of Rally, her yellow uniform 
slightly disheveled as she slept.  Rally was already beginning to feel 
sleepy as she stroked Seras&#39; back.  &#39;I guess eternity wouldn&#39;t be bad... 
just so long as my master is here with me.  But I wonder though,&#39; she 
thought as sleep was starting to overtake her, &#39;what about... the people 
who... bought Goldie&#39;s formula.&#39;
 
AN UNKNOWN LOCATION IN BRAZIL, AT THE SAME TIME...
 
A lanky individual wearing eyeglasses with multiple lenses entered the 
office, where a rotund blond man in a white suit was seated at a desk.  
&quot;Vell, Herr Major,&quot; the individual said in a thick German accent, &quot;my 
trip is a success.  I must admit that I vas a little curious about our 
little experiment using Kerasine to better the implantation of my 
vampire chip, but the results are promising.&quot;  Opening a small 
briefcase, he produced a piece of paper.  &quot;Behold,&quot; he announced as he 
gave the Major the paper, &quot;the formula for Kerasine.&quot;
 
The Major took the time to look at the formula.  &quot;Vunderbar, Herr 
Doctor,&quot; he said, smiling.  &quot;I vould gather that you&#39;ve already studied 
the formula?&quot;
 
&quot;Da,&quot; the Doctor said.
 
&quot;Und?&quot; the Major implored.
 
The Doctor took some time to compose his words, &quot;Clearly, the process 
vould be long, and vould require many trials... but I do believe that an 
oral version of the drug IS possible.  All that I require is your 
approval to begin.&quot;
 
&quot;Very well, Herr Doctor, you may proceed.&quot;  The Major then got up from 
his desk and paced around his office, which was decorated with many 
relics from Nazi Germany in the past, then said.  &quot;Ve may have to vait a 
vhile... but it vill be vorth it, then soon ve can proceed vith the 
upcoming var... und the var after that... und the var after that.  Und 
then the next... und then the next... und then the next... und then... 
the next.&quot;
 
THE END...?
 
AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE - And so finally, this draws an end to the story... but 
you know... it really doesn&#39;t have to end.  I&#39;ve really gotten a kick of 
writing this series, and I really like to make more of them.  I&#39;m 
thinking about naming the next of these series of fics, &#39;Night Angels&#39; 
and I like to hear your ideas about future plots.
 
As for right now, I&#39;m thinking of writing an extra chapter.  What I 
would like to do is to concentrate on the day that Rally was turned, and 
what those close to her are going through as they wait for Rally to 
rise.  I got a few ideas on how to write it... but I like to hear your 
ideas.  Please email me and let me know.
 
Until we meet again... LATER!
