<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 10 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/wildhorse-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Akane awoke to find herself gagged and bound tightly, leaning against 
the wall next to her father and Mr. Saotome. Angry, she began to 
struggle against her bonds, but they proved too much for even her 
rage-fueled strength. Her anger, having failed her, slowly faded to be 
replaced by something else...grief.

Tears began to spill down her cheeks as it hit home what she had become. 
She was an abuser, far worse than a pervert, and she had abused the boy 
she had come to love because she couldn&#39;t see past her anger and 
jealousy. It surprised her that she could admit she loved Ranma so 
easily, even if only to herself.

Akane didn&#39;t know if Ranma would be coming back or not after this was 
over. If he did, the girls pursuing him would have to change if they 
wanted him. He was learning what it was like to be in a relationship 
based on affection and fun as opposed to violence and the dictates of 
honor. If any of them were to find happiness with him now, they would 
have to meet this new standard, assuming they could.

Cologne observed the girls sadly. They were all learning harsh truths. 
Shampoo had been subdued ever since she heard Ranma imply that he&#39;d 
rather forget her. The Kuonji girl was learning of her failings 
concerning the pigtailed martial artist as well. The youngest Tendo girl 
looked as though even she had begun to realize her own faults. Even the 
mercenary appeared to be considering that maybe she didn&#39;t quite know 
Ranma as well as she thought, and perhaps she had been too hasty to 
dismiss him.

Nodoka pondered what she had seen thus far. It disturbed her how much at 
ease her son was in his female form. Worse yet was how she saw him 
quivering in terror when those girls had snuggled up to him. How could 
he be manly if he reacted like that when a girl was affectionate with 
him? How could he be manly at all when he obviously enjoyed being a girl 
so much? The only comfort Nodoka could find in the situation was that he 
did at least appear to be interested in girls, even if he was terrified 
of them.

Glancing down at the family honor blade beside her, she thought about 
the contract. While it grieved her to think it, perhaps it would be 
better if he did not return. Then she would be spared having to judge 
her son as lacking and enforce the terms of the contract.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Asuka, I&#39;m telling you, this is a waste of time,&quot; Ranma tried again as 
she and Rei were dragged into yet another store in search of the perfect 
bikini. &quot;They ain&#39;t gonna let us go on that class trip to Okinawa. Think 
about it. What if an angel attacks while we&#39;re gone? Who&#39;s gonna be here 
to fight it?&quot;

&quot;Of course they&#39;re going to let us go, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka sang. &quot;We 
deserve a vacation and the class trip is a very important part of a 
Japanese school culture. Now how does this look?&quot;

Ranma sighed as Asuka held up a tiny swatch of spandex/lycra against 
herself.

&quot;Why not just go naked?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;It&#39;d be cheaper and you&#39;d still 
have almost as much covered. Right, Rei?&quot;

&quot;Your idea does have merit. Perhaps, I, too, shall do as you suggest,&quot; 
Rei said, flashing a brief, but mischievous grin.

Asuka snickered at the gaping look on Ranma&#39;s face as the girl 
sputtered.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t be such a prude, Ranma,&quot; Asuka chirped.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s different anyway,&quot; Ranma shrugged. &quot;Going from being 
called a pervert to being a prude.&quot;

&quot;Here, go try this one on,&quot; Asuka said, handing Ranma another bikini.

While this one at least wasn&#39;t a thong and had a lot more material than 
the last one Asuka had held up, the color was a big problem for Ranma.

&quot;No way,&quot; Ranma shook her head vigorously, her pigtail flying. &quot;Not a 
chance. I don&#39;t do pink. It might look good on Rei though.&quot;

&quot;Very well, I shall try it,&quot; Rei said, plucking the suit out of Asuka&#39;s 
hand and heading for the dressing room.

Asuka shrugged and went back to looking through the racks. Ranma just 
stood there rocking back and forth on her heels.

&quot;Don&#39;t just stand there, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka said a little crossly. 
&quot;You can look too, ya know?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Ranma snorted, but began looking through the racks 
herself.

Rei came out of the dressing room in the bikini that Asuka had picked 
out and walked up to them, presenting herself for judgment. Asuka made 
her turn around a few times and looked at the blue-haired girl 
appraisingly.

&quot;The cut is great,&quot; Asuka concluded, &quot;but the color is all wrong for 
you, Rei. You&#39;re so pale and this color makes you look washed out. We 
can do better.&quot; Rei nodded and headed back to the dressing room as Asuka 
turned to Ranma. &quot;Let&#39;s see what you picked out, Variable-chan.&quot;

Ranma presented her selections.

&quot;Gah! Geez, Ranma, a nun would be embarrassed to wear something that 
prudish and dowdy,&quot; Asuka said, rejecting Ranma&#39;s first three choices. 
&quot;The other two aren&#39;t bad, but your hips beg to be displayed. So not 
boy-bottoms for you!&quot; thus rejecting Ranma&#39;s remaining selections and 
sending her back to the racks grumbling.

(oO\O/Oo)

An hour later, the trio had found suits that met with Asuka&#39;s approval. 
Rei had ended up with a royal blue tankini that flattered her slender 
torso. Ranma had been talked into an emerald green bikini with high-cut 
bottoms and an under-wire top, which in her opinion displayed entirely 
too much cleavage. Asuka had chosen one with white, high-cut bottoms and 
a red and white striped racer-back, halter-style top.

Currently, they were at the &#39;reward&#39; portion of this outing; the ice 
cream shop. Not that Ranma was happy about it. It seemed that the owner 
had come up with a counter to the dreaded Anything Goes Uber-Cute Ice 
Cream Scamming Technique and not even the devastating Revised Twin 
Attack had worked for them today.

Ranma looked morosely at her piteously small and plain banana split and 
lamented about the injustice of it all. Here she was, having been 
subjected to a day of shopping and being made to model twenty different 
skimpy outfits only to find that the new counter boy with the strange 
lisp seemed impervious to their collective feminine charms. She pouted 
cutely at how wrong this all was. What good was being a cute girl if you 
couldn&#39;t scam extra treats?

&quot;Oh cheer up, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka said cheerfully. &quot;If you&#39;re gonna 
pout like that, I&#39;ll buy you another one.&quot;

&quot;You really mean it, Asuka-chan?&quot; Ranma asked in a saccharin tone, 
instantly brightening and looking up at Asuka with big, sparkling eyes.

&quot;Gah!&quot; Asuka recoiled from the sheer cuteness being directed at her, 
while Rei snickered softly. &quot;Uh...yeah, just stop with the cuteness 
before I go into insulin shock,&quot; Asuka whined.

(oO\O/Oo)

A bead of sweat appeared on Pen Pen&#39;s head as he was once again 
determined to strip Rei of her title as undisputed staring champion of 
the household. His training and concentration proved fruitless, however, 
when a nearby scream of outrage caused the hard-pressed bird to blink 
and lose the match yet again.

&quot;What do you mean we can&#39;t go?&quot; Asuka wailed. &quot;I&#39;ve been looking forward 
to going diving again for so long now! You can&#39;t do this! It&#39;s not 
fair!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Asuka, but that&#39;s just the way it is,&quot; Misato said in a 
reasonable tone. &quot;Your job is too important for any of you to be allowed 
to go on a trip that far away.&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;re on permanent stand-by?&quot; Asuka demanded loudly. &quot;Who&#39;s the 
dummkopf that decided that?&quot;

&quot;That would be me, the Operations Planning Officer,&quot; Misato said smugly.

&quot;Ranma,&quot; Asuka pleaded, &quot;tell her how messed up this is. Do something!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Asuka, I tried to warn you that this was going to happen,&quot; Ranma 
shook his head.

&quot;Yeah, but you like to tell the chain of command where to stick it when 
you don&#39;t like their ideas. So tell her,&quot; Asuka persisted.

&quot;I only do that when I think they&#39;re being morons,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;This 
time I think Misato&#39;s right.&quot; Misato shot Asuka a smug look. &quot;I know it 
doesn&#39;t happen often, and after that crap with the last angel, I&#39;m 
beginning to wonder if any of them know what the hell they&#39;re doing.&quot; 
Misato&#39;s eye developed a twitch. &quot;This time I think they&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;What? You&#39;re taking her side?&quot; Asuka shrieked. &quot;How could you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not taking anyone&#39;s side, Asuka-chan,&quot; Ranma explained placatingly. 
&quot;I&#39;m just saying, we can&#39;t fight angels if we&#39;re in Okinawa. If we don&#39;t 
fight, then everyone dies.&quot;

&quot;So they all get to have fun while we&#39;re stuck here waiting for an 
attack?&quot; Asuka demanded. &quot;Well, that sucks. It&#39;s not fair.&quot;

&quot;Trust me on this, life is rarely fair,&quot; Ranma said sagely. &quot;This is the 
price you&#39;re paying for having the glory of defending the world. 
Besides, since we won&#39;t have to go to school, think of all the training 
we can get done!&quot;

Even Rei sweat-dropped, seeing the maniacal gleam in Ranma&#39;s eyes at the 
prospect of two weeks of training. He had been training Rei in the 
mornings and evenings for a while now and Asuka had joined them after 
they killed the last angel. Rei had proven herself slightly more 
advanced than Asuka thanks to Ranma&#39;s training and she had a lot better 
pain-tolerance. However, Asuka was a lot more creative and less 
predictable than Rei so it was often a toss up in their spars as to who 
came out on top.

&quot;You can also use the time to catch up on your schoolwork and pull your 
grades up,&quot; Misato interjected. &quot;Don&#39;t think I haven&#39;t seen your report 
cards. As your guardian, I get your grades sent directly to my terminal 
and I am very disappointed with all of you...&quot;

&quot;Stuff it, Misato,&quot; Ranma interrupted. &quot;If you really want to talk about 
poor performance, we can discuss the last angel some more. I think that 
has a little more impact on the survival of the human race than whether 
we get good grades in school.&quot;

Misato gaped at Ranma, sputtering.

&quot;Ranma&#39;s right,&quot; Asuka agreed. &quot;It&#39;s not like I should even have to 
worry about going to school.&quot;

&quot;Ranma...&quot; Misato growled. &quot;What about our agreement? You said if I 
respected your abilities that you would respect my authority.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that got to do with this?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;I&#39;m exercising my authority to insist that you pull your grades up,&quot; 
Misato informed him.

Ranma blinked. Technically, she had him there. When that agreement was 
made, Ranma had just been thinking of it as applying to his job as an 
Eva pilot. He hadn&#39;t considered it could apply outside of that.

&quot;Okay, Misato, but on one condition,&quot; Ranma stipulated.

&quot;What&#39;s your condition?&quot; Misato asked. She didn&#39;t like the way Ranma 
grinned evilly.

&quot;You&#39;re going to be training with us, at least three hours a day,&quot; the 
pigtailed pilot smirked. &quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be all at once. We can 
break it down to an hour and a half in the morning and another hour and 
a half in the evening. It&#39;ll be good for you and you&#39;ll lose that beer 
gut you&#39;ve got going on there.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Misato squawked indignantly. &quot;Ranma! You can be a real JERK 
sometimes, you know that?&quot;

&quot;Well, it must run in the family,&quot; Ranma chuckled. &quot;The world&#39;s biggest 
jerk is my father, after all.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Asuka stood on the NERV gym mat in her typical aggressive stance, legs 
apart, hands on her hips, and a challenging look on her face as Misato 
flounced out of the locker room looking vaguely disgruntled. Ranma and 
Rei knelt in seiza position off to the side of the mat.

The German redhead, dressed in the workout outfit she had adopted since 
she began to train with Ranma, a pair of black and red spandex shorts 
and a black sports bra over which she wore a red t-shirt, knotted just 
below her breasts, looked over the older woman appraisingly. The leggy, 
purple-haired woman was wearing a pair of black, silk running shorts 
over a pair of purple spandex shorts. On top she was wearing a black 
sports bra under a loose midriff-baring cut off t-shirt. Her hair was 
gathered in a high ponytail while Asuka had taken a cue from Ranma and 
was wearing hers in a braid.

&quot;It&#39;s about time, Misato,&quot; the redhead said as the woman stepped on the 
mat. &quot;Variable-chan has asked me to &#39;evaluate&#39; you.&quot; The evil glint in 
Asuka&#39;s eye suggested to Misato that this wouldn&#39;t be a pleasant 
experience. Her next words confirmed it. &quot;I do have some frustrations to 
work off since I didn&#39;t get to go relax in Okinawa. Go ahead and get 
stretched out. Let me know when you&#146;re ready.&quot;

Misato wasn&#39;t intimidated. If it was Ranma, that would have been 
different, but this was Asuka. How much could the pigtailed martial 
artist have taught her in the few weeks they had been training? The 
older woman was certain she would come out on top. It wasn&#39;t like she 
was untrained or anything. However, a glance at the smirking Ranma, as 
she stretched, didn&#39;t do much for her confidence.

After Misato stretched out, she turned to face Asuka who was looking at 
her with a credible version of Ranma&#39;s cocky, amused smirk.

&quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; Misato grunted.

&quot;Okay, this is just a sparring match to see where Misato is,&quot; Ranma 
spoke. &quot;No crippling or lethal blows permitted. You will both stop 
immediately if I call for it. Other than that, anything goes. 
Understood?&quot;

&quot;Sure thing, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka chirped.

&quot;Right,&quot; Misato agreed.

&quot;Begin,&quot; Ranma called.

The echo from Ranma&#39;s voice hadn&#39;t even faded before Misato found 
herself on the defensive. Asuka was on her immediately, probing her 
defenses with punches and kicks. The older woman grunted in pain as 
Asuka landed an only partially blocked spinning back kick to her ribs. 
Moments later, Misato found herself face down on the mat, her arm 
stretched out behind her in a painful joint lock as Asuka&#39;s knee rested 
on her spine.

&quot;Geez, Misato,&quot; Ranma commented as Asuka released her. &quot;I thought you&#39;d 
do a lot better than that. Asuka took you down in what? Less than 30 
seconds? That&#39;s pretty pathetic for someone who fancies herself a 
soldier.&quot;

&quot;I underestimated her,&quot; Misato growled getting to her feet. &quot;It won&#39;t 
happen again.&quot;

&quot;Pretty confident, ain&#39;tcha,&quot; Asuka smirked. &quot;We&#39;ll just see what you 
have to say the next time you&#39;re picking yourself up off the mat.&quot;

&quot;Begin,&quot; Ranma announced.

Misato managed to last much longer that time, but inevitably, she still 
went down. By the time Ranma called a halt twenty minutes later, Misato 
felt like a punching bag. She was sweating heavily and gasping for 
breath. Her legs, arms, and torso would be sporting some impressive 
bruising by tomorrow. Her lip was split and a thin trail of blood 
dripped down her chin from where Asuka punched her in the mouth. Misato 
was just thankful she managed to raise her head so that it wasn&#39;t her 
nose that got hit.

Not that Asuka had gotten off untouched. The redhead would also be 
sporting her share of bruises and Misato had managed to put her down a 
couple of times. In contrast, though, Asuka was lightly coated with 
sweat and barely panting from the exertion. She was also smiling, unlike 
Misato.

&quot;You&#39;re right, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka chirped happily. &quot;I do feel better 
now that I&#39;ve beat on the person that ruined my diving plans.&quot;

&quot;Good, I&#39;m glad,&quot; Ranma said giving her a warm smile before turning to 
Misato, who was now bent over with her hands on her knees panting 
heavily. &quot;As for you, Misato, not bad for a juicer with only basic 
training and whose idea of strenuous exercise is wandering around NERV 
trying to figure out where she is.&quot; Misato would have growled at him if 
she had the breath to spare. &quot;Anyway, at least we&#39;ve got something to 
work with. We should have that body of yours toned and taut and your 
skill level up there in no time.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I don&#39;t think Misato likes you very much after today, Variable-chan,&quot; 
Asuka giggled as she, Ranma, and Rei relaxed in the NERV Jacuzzi.

&quot;Hey, you&#39;re the one that beat her up,&quot; Ranma grinned.

&quot;Yeah, but then you worked her like a dog doing kata afterward,&quot; Asuka 
pointed out. &quot;She looked like she wanted to crawl off and die.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll thank me for it in a few weeks when she notices how much better 
she looks and feels,&quot; Ranma chuckled.

&quot;I know I do,&quot; Asuka smiled.

&quot;Hey, what are you doing?&quot; Ranma asked, surprised.

Asuka didn&#39;t say anything as she crawled into Ranma&#39;s lap and leaned 
back against his chest. Pulling his arms around her waist, she sighed 
happily as she relaxed, letting her head rest on his shoulder nuzzling 
his.

&quot;Just relax, Handsome,&quot; Asuka said softly. &quot;Just doing a little more 
deprogramming.&quot;

Rei looked at Asuka relaxing in Ranma&#39;s arms and felt envious, but she 
knew that it wasn&#39;t possible for her to share in the closeness at the 
moment. Her time would come later after they were out of sight of NERV. 
She was surprised when she felt a hand take hers and pull it over to 
rest on Asuka&#39;s tummy under cover of the water. Ranma smiled at her 
reassuringly and suddenly Rei felt much more at ease as the trio 
continued to soak quietly in the hot tub, enjoying each other&#39;s company.

(oO\O/Oo)

Misato groaned as she sank painfully into the chair in front of 
Ritsuko&#39;s desk. Ritsuko&#39;s eyes widened as she saw Misato&#39;s swollen lip 
and the bruise developing on her mouth.

&quot;What the hell happened to you?&quot; Ritsuko asked in surprise.

&quot;Damn kids,&quot; Misato growled, causing Ritsuko&#39;s eyebrow to raise as she 
leaned forward, eager to hear this story. &quot;You sure you don&#39;t wanna take 
over as their guardian?&quot;

&quot;Not on your life,&quot; Ritsuko giggled. &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;I had to agree to let Ranma train me to get him to pull his grades up,&quot; 
Misato sighed. &quot;Asuka wasn&#39;t very happy when I told her that she 
couldn&#39;t go to Okinawa with their class. Ranma had her &#39;spar&#39; with me to 
&#39;evaluate&#39; my skill level.&quot;

&quot;In other words, he let her beat you like a drum until she felt better, 
huh?&quot; Ritsuko smirked.

Misato sneered sarcastically at her.

&quot;Yeah, it was real funny,&quot; Misato groaned. &quot;Now shut up and give me some 
of the good stuff.&quot; Ritsuko opened her desk drawer and extracted a 
bottle of painkillers, tossing them to Misato. Misato extracted two and 
swallowed them before tossing the bottle back. &quot;And then the sadistic 
little bastard made me do kata for another hour before he dismissed me.&quot;

&quot;Now that&#39;s funny,&quot; Ritsuko said with a laugh. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s good for 
you. You&#39;re not getting any younger and that bar-hopping lifestyle you 
lead will catch up to you if you don&#39;t start working out.&quot;

&quot;Gee thanks,&quot; Misato snorted sarcastically. &quot;I knew I could count on my 
best friend for support.&quot;

&quot;Now you know what the Commander feels like when Ranma is upset,&quot; 
Ritsuko pointed out.

&quot;I&#39;d just as soon not,&quot; Misato returned. &quot;The worst part is, I have to 
go back for another hour and a half session this afternoon.&quot;

&quot;Aw, you poor thing,&quot; Ritsuko said insincerely. &quot;You know, you could 
always admit defeat and let Ranma worry about his grades himself.&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot; Misato said resolutely. &quot;I&#39;ll show that little jerk he can&#39;t 
get the best of Misato Katsuragi! I&#39;ll take his training and I&#39;ll beat 
his redheaded little girlfriend down and see how he likes that!&quot;

&quot;You realize you&#39;re talking about beating up a 14 year old girl, right?&quot; 
Ritsuko asked with a large sweat-drop on her head.

&quot;Better yet, let&#39;s see how she likes it when I take her boyfriend away 
from her for a nice rubdown tonight,&quot; Misato cackled evilly.

&quot;Oh, good thinking,&quot; Ritsuko drawled. &quot;Then you can have both Asuka and 
Rei wanting to &#39;evaluate&#39; you.&quot;

&quot;Bring&#39;em on!&quot; Misato crowed. &quot;I&#39;ll whip their skanky little asses and 
take their man from them!&quot;

Ritsuko looked at the bottle of painkillers dubiously. Perhaps she 
shouldn&#39;t have given Misato something that strong. She was on duty after 
all.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Arrrgh!&quot; Ranma snarled as she sat by the pool in her new bikini doing 
her physics problems on her laptop. She longed to throw the infernal 
device into the pool and be done with it.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Variable-chan?&quot; Asuka asked coming up behind Ranma and 
putting her arms around the other girl&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;Stupid physics,&quot; Ranma pouted.

&quot;Oh, is that all?&quot; Asuka asked, her hand reaching out and tapping some 
keys on Ranma&#39;s computer. &quot;There, see? That was easy.&quot;

&quot;Maybe for you,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I ain&#39;t had that much schooling. The guy 
Pop left me with said it was a distraction from the art and only let me 
go when the local authorities made him. If it&#39;s so easy, how come your 
grades are so bad?&quot;

&quot;Because I have a hard time figuring out what the questions are asking,&quot; 
Asuka sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not that good at reading the Kanji.&quot;

&quot;Okay, that makes sense,&quot; Ranma nodded. &quot;It&#39;s not like you need to go to 
school here anyway. I know you were in college in Germany.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I graduated last year with my Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Science,&quot; 
Asuka said proudly.

&quot;Wow, you&#39;re pretty smart,&quot; Ranma smiled.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Asuka agreed. &quot;So are you.&quot;

&quot;What? Me? Nah, I ain&#39;t all that smart,&quot; Ranma disagreed.

&quot;Sure you are, Variable-chan,&quot; Asuka ruffled Ranma&#39;s hair. &quot;Uneducated 
doesn&#39;t equal stupid. I&#39;ve seen you come up with some really brilliant 
solutions to a lot of problems we&#39;ve had.&quot;

&quot;I dunno,&quot; Ranma said doubtfully. &quot;I mean most of the things I came up 
with the solutions for were pretty obvious.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why with all the brain power they have here they came up with it 
before you did, right?&quot; Asuka smirked.

&quot;I guess,&quot; Ranma agreed reluctantly.

&quot;Enough studying for now,&quot; Asuka grinned wickedly. &quot;I wanna play.&quot;

With that she grabbed Ranma and tossed her into the pool.

Rei sighed sadly as she watched the redheads chase each other around the 
pool, giggling and shrieking as they splashed and dunked each other. She 
really wanted to participate too, but the security tapes would most 
likely be seen by the Commander. She would then have to explain her 
change in behavior, which could lead to her and Ranma being separated. 
That could not be allowed to happen.

Rei&#39;s introspection was interrupted by the appearance of two redheads 
surfacing from the water in front of her.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rei?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;You look sad.&quot;

&quot;Do you wanna come play with us?&quot; Asuka asked.

&quot;I cannot,&quot; Rei said sadly. &quot;If I were to do so, Commander Ikari would 
not approve and take steps to come between us.&quot;

&quot;Aw, geez, I&#39;m sorry, Rei,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I didn&#39;t think about that. How 
about we get out of here where we can all have fun together?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s get out of here,&quot; Asuka said giving Rei a smile. &quot;Then you 
guys can explain to me what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Four hours later, the trio was back at NERV. They had been at home, 
enjoying a group snuggle, Rei taking her turn being held on Ranma&#39;s lap 
as she told the other two about how she had been raised by Gendo, when 
their phones rang to call them in. If anything, Rei&#39;s life was as bad as 
Ranma&#39;s, the only real difference being that the focus was on 
psychological abuse and conditioning rather than physical as it had been 
with Ranma.

Asuka had looked positively green as she heard about some of the 
consequences Rei had faced if she had displayed any emotion or behavior 
other than calm obedience. Ranma was faced with a pretty eye-opening 
realization. Suddenly, he knew how others viewed Genma when they were 
told about the things Genma had done to him. He had never understood why 
they were so angry, sometimes even sick, when they heard. Now he knew 
because, for the first time, Ranma truly wanted to kill a person and 
take pleasure in it as he ripped them apart bit by bit.

Instead, he just held Rei close as she told her disturbing tale while 
Asuka snuggled up to his side and held Rei&#39;s hands supportively. After 
Rei finished, Asuka decided that she would tell them her story, the 
close supportive environment they had achieved having allowed her to 
drop walls to some extent. Ranma had put his arm around Asuka&#39;s 
shoulder, still holding Rei in his lap, as Asuka told them about the 
father that abandoned her and her mother and how her mother had slowly 
gone insane before being locked in an institution with a doll that she 
talked to as if it were Asuka. Finally, Asuka told them about entering 
the room to see her mother had hung herself.

Though her eyes were brimming, Asuka didn&#39;t cry. She hadn&#39;t quite let 
her walls down that far, but one day maybe she would. Then it was 
Ranma&#39;s turn to tell his story while in the comforting embrace of the 
two girls. When it was over, they each realized that none of them had 
had it any better than the others and in the end the three of them just 
sat quietly, enjoying the closeness and the fact that they had each 
other and didn&#39;t have to be alone anymore.

It didn&#39;t really matter that each of them had held something back that 
they weren&#39;t ready to share with the others. For Rei, it was her true 
nature; for Asuka it had been the true depth of her pain; for Ranma it 
was his true origins, the fact that he was not of this world. For now, 
it was enough to know that they could each relate to the others, knowing 
that each shared the burden of a troubled, unpleasant past.

So it was three subdued teens who stood before Dr. Ritsuko Akagi as she 
briefed them on the situation. While she filled them in on what was 
going on and the plans to deal with it, Ritsuko picked up on the somber 
air around the trio. The blonde scientist wondered what could have 
happened to sap the vitality that seemed to radiate from Asuka and 
Ranma.

&quot;So do you all understand the plan?&quot; Ritsuko asked and received three 
nods. &quot;Good, Asuka, you will be the one going in. Ranma, you will be on 
the top as her backup.&quot;

&quot;What are my orders?&quot; Rei asked when they weren&#39;t forthcoming.

&quot;Rei, you will stay here just in case,&quot; Ritsuko informed her.

&quot;I understand,&quot; Rei said, her shoulders slumping a little as she looked 
down at the floor.

Her reaction wasn&#39;t lost on Ranma. As Ritsuko led Asuka off to fit her 
with her heat resistant plug suit, Ranma pulled Rei aside.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rei?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;It is nothing,&quot; Rei replied dispassionately as always.

&quot;Is it because you&#39;re not going with us?&quot; Ranma persisted. &quot;You&#39;re 
feeling left out?&quot;

&quot;I-I do not like being left behind,&quot; Rei said hesitantly. &quot;I wish to be 
there with you and Asuka. I am being foolish.&quot;

&quot;No, you&#39;re not, Rei,&quot; Ranma disagreed. &quot;I know if it was you and Asuka 
going, I&#39;d want to be there with ya. It&#39;s because you care. Nothin&#39; 
wrong with that and it ain&#39;t foolish. I promise, as soon as this is 
done, I&#39;ll come right back.&quot;

&quot;That will be acceptable,&quot; Rei nodded as they headed off to the locker 
rooms.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I&#39;m not going out there like this!&quot; Asuka wailed. &quot;This is 
embarrassing!&quot;

&quot;The suit will compress once the entry plug is pressurized,&quot; Ritsuko 
said tiredly. &quot;Now let&#39;s go. We don&#39;t have much time.&quot;

&quot;But I just can&#39;t go out there!&quot; Asuka mewled. &quot;I can&#39;t let him see me 
like this! I look like a big, red beach ball!&quot;

&quot;Let who see you like this?&quot; Ritsuko asked in a teasing tone causing 
Asuka to blush as red as her suit when she realized what she had said. 
&quot;Wait right here. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;

Ritsuko walked out of the room and quickly spotted Ranma in his plug 
suit waiting nearby. She marched up to him and grabbed his hand before 
dragging the confused pilot back the way she had come, into the girls&#39; 
locker room.

&quot;There,&quot; Ritsuko said, grinning in triumph. &quot;Now he&#39;s seen you so you 
don&#39;t have anything to worry about.&quot;

&quot;WAH? Don&#39;t look at me!&quot; Asuka wailed as she caught sight of a wide-eyed 
Ranma being dragged by Ritsuko.

&quot;Why not?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Because I look so stupid,&quot; Asuka whined.

&quot;Heh,&quot; Ranma smirked as he crossed his arms and leaned against a locker. 
&quot;Now you know how I feel when you drag me around in my girl form making 
me try on all those clothes.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s different!&quot; Asuka protested. &quot;You looked good. I just look 
like a fool.&quot;

Ranma frowned then had a moment of inspiration. He had learned a few 
things about dealing with girls since he had arrived here and he had 
gotten much better at keeping his foot out of his mouth.

&quot;Asuka-chan,&quot; Ranma said soothingly. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if that suit 
makes you look like a big red balloon. I know you&#39;re still the same cute 
girl inside it.&quot;

Well, he hadn&#39;t mastered the art of keeping his foot out of his mouth 
quite yet, but he was doing much better. Asuka&#39;s look darkened as she 
heard the first part of what he said, but unlike the girls from back 
home, she hadn&#39;t stopped listening at the first sign of something she 
didn&#39;t like. Her face softened and her cheeks bloomed a light pink as 
the second part penetrated.

&quot;You really mean it?&quot; Asuka asked. &quot;You really think I&#39;m cute?&quot;

&quot;I...uh...&quot; Ranma stammered softly, feeling his face heat up with his 
own blush and feeling really nervous all of a sudden. &quot;Yeah, beyond cute 
even. Beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Oh Ranma!&quot; Asuka said happily. &quot;Okay, I can do this. No problem.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Oh my, that was so beautiful,&quot; Kasumi said, dabbing a tear from her eye 
as Nabiki rewound the tape.

&quot;Who would have thought Ranma had it in him?&quot; Nabiki smirked.

&quot;Ran-chan always was a soft touch for a girl in distress,&quot; Ukyo pointed 
out somberly, remembering when he had told her that she was the cute 
fianc&eacute;e.

She had been crying and depressed at the time and she had grabbed on to 
his words like a lifeline. It was a bitter realization that they hadn&#39;t 
sounded nearly as sincere as the words he just said to the redhead. How 
had she gone so wrong with Ranma? In just a few short months, those two 
girls had gotten closer to and received more affection from Ranma than 
all the rest of them had in a year.

She knew the answer. Their love didn&#39;t hurt him. They didn&#146;t ask him to 
choose. They didn&#39;t throw honor in his face to try and manipulate him. 
They didn&#39;t compete over him and they never selfishly demanded his 
attention. Instead, those girls seemed content to share him, even 
supporting each other at times in being with him.

As much as Ukyo hated them for taking the man she loved, she found she 
couldn&#39;t begrudge them. She had heard their stories and they deserved 
what happiness they could find. Maybe if Ranma came back, she could take 
a lesson from them on how to earn his affection.</pre>
