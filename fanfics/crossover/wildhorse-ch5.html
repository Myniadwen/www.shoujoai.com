<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 5 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/wildhorse-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Nabiki walked along behind Akane and Ukyo on their way home from school, 
listening to them complain about the girl Rei Ayanami who appeared to be 
moving in on Ranma. Privately, Nabiki found the whole situation 
hilarious. Not only were the girls getting jealous over a fictional 
character, but said fictional character probably had a far better chance 
of gaining Ranma&#39;s affections than they did.

Suddenly, Akane stopped walking, nearly causing Nabiki to walk into her. 
Peering over Akane&#39;s shoulder, Nabiki blinked. It seemed they were about 
to add another spectator to Ranma&#39;s Odyssey.

&quot;Hiya, Auntie Saotome,&quot; Nabiki greeted. &quot;How are you today?&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon, Akane-chan, Nabiki-chan,&quot; Nodoka Saotome smiled. &quot;I was 
just on my way to visit your home to see if my husband and son were back 
yet. They&#39;re so manly to be so dedicated to their training.&quot;

Akane grimaced and glanced at Nabiki. Nabiki thought for a moment and 
nodded.

&quot;Auntie, there&#39;s something we have to tell you about Ranma,&quot; Akane said 
grimly.

&quot;Has something happened to my son?&quot; Nodoka asked with concern.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so, Auntie,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;It&#39;s going to be a long story and 
a little hard to accept, so why don&#39;t we head home first. It will also 
take some demonstrations to convince you of the truth.&quot;

An hour later, with the assistance of Cologne to prevent Genma from 
fleeing, Nodoka was informed of the whole story as far as the Tendo 
sisters knew it. Several demonstrations of the curses were made and 
Nabiki brought out her video footage of Ranma changing into &#39;Ranko&#39;. 
Needless to say, Nodoka was completely floored. She didn&#39;t know whether 
to flay the skin from Genma&#39;s body in a slow, painful fashion followed 
by a nice roll in a bed of salt, cheer for her son&#39;s manliness, or 
grieve for the fact that she might never see him again.

&quot;S-so, what you are telling me, is that my son has been b-banished to 
this apocalyptic, psycho-drama anime show and we may watch his exploits 
there, but he may n-never return?&quot; Nodoka stammered.

&quot;In a nutshell,&quot; Nabiki agreed.

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Nodoka commented.

&quot;We were just about to watch the second tape,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Won&#39;t you 
join us, Auntie?&quot;

&quot;Yes, dear, I believe I will,&quot; Nodoka said.

&quot;How wonderful,&quot; Kasumi said pleasantly. &quot;And if you like, tomorrow 
while the girls are at school, you can watch the first tape to catch 
up.&quot;

Kasumi brought out a large tray of snacks and tea for everyone and after 
Cologne struck Genma&#39;s paralysis point to keep him from eating the 
entire tray, the group settled in to watch the next tape.

(oO\O/Oo)

Misato stood before a large map pinned to the board in their on-site 
base of operations. She was briefing the two pilots in front of her on 
their mission assignment.

&quot;Ranma, since you have the best sync ratio, you will be the shooter,&quot; 
Misato said. &quot;If you don&#146;t destroy it with your first shot, Rei will 
protect you from counter-fire with this heat shield off of the Space 
Shuttle. The gun will take about 30 seconds to cool down and recharge 
for another shot. You have to be sure to replace the fuse after the 
shot.&quot;

&quot;How long will the heat shield last?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;We project it will last 17 seconds,&quot; Misato said glumly.

&quot;Which would leave Rei to block the beam with her body for the remaining 
13 seconds,&quot; Ranma concluded. &quot;Misato, I have a better suggestion.&quot;

&quot;Ranma,&quot; Misato said warningly.

&quot;You promised you&#39;d listen, Misato,&quot; Ranma reminded.

&quot;Okay, what&#39;s your suggestion?&quot; Misato sighed.

&quot;I should be the one with the shield. Rei should be the shooter,&quot; Ranma 
said, before she was interrupted by Misato.

&quot;Ranma, you&#39;re the shooter because you have the best sync ratio and you 
have the best chance of taking this thing out,&quot; Misato argued.

&quot;You didn&#39;t let me finish, Misato,&quot; Ranma chastised. &quot;Look, maybe I do 
have the best sync ratio, but I also have other abilities that would be 
better suited to the shielding position. I have a technique called the 
Soul of Ice. I didn&#39;t have time to get it up before the beam hit last 
time, but with the technique I can actively cool the shield which will 
make it last a lot longer. In addition to that, the technique will also 
make the beam take longer to damage Unit 01&#39;s armor. My ki can also help 
absorb any damage that does happen. Where as Rei might have to suffer 
the beam unprotected for 13 seconds, I might be able to sustain the 
shield for long enough for the gun to be ready to fire again.&quot;

&quot;Come on, Ranma,&quot; Misato said. &quot;You don&#39;t honestly expect me to believe 
that, do you?&quot;

Suddenly, the temperature in the room dropped sharply. Rei stepped away 
from Ranma as bitter cold radiated off her. The humidity in the air 
began to condense into a slight mist around the redheaded girl and frost 
began to form on her plug suit. Misato gaped at her.

&quot;Believe me now?&quot; Ranma asked, her breath puffing out in a cloud of 
steam.

Misato nodded dumbly and Ranma dropped the technique.

&quot;There&#39;s more,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It doesn&#39;t really matter much how long it 
takes for the gun to cycle. If I&#39;m between Rei and the target, she won&#39;t 
have a shot. That means I have to stay there as long as the angel can 
sustain its beam. That might be a lot longer than 30 seconds.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay, you made your point,&quot; Misato said. &quot;Rei, you&#39;re the 
shooter. Ranma will be the shield. Ranma, if you get killed, I&#39;m gonna 
kick your ass. Got it?&quot;

&quot;Sure, Misato,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;Nice to know someone cares. Most people 
I know would be rooting for me to get killed.&quot;

Misato stepped up and hugged the smaller girl.

&quot;Of course I care, you dope,&quot; Misato smiled. &quot;Now get your butt out 
there and get ready. Good luck.&quot;

&quot;My luck ain&#39;t never been good, Misato,&quot; Ranma laughed as she followed 
Rei out of the command post. &quot;I&#39;ll just have to depend on my skill.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma and Rei sat on the gantries beside their Evas waiting for the 
mission launch time.

&quot;Pilot Ikari?&quot; Rei inquired.

&quot;Please call me Ranma, Rei,&quot; Ranma said with a wry grin. &quot;We&#39;re friends, 
I&#39;m pretty sure, so you&#39;re allowed. What did you want?&quot;

&quot;Ranma, I wish to know why you convinced Captain Katsuragi to allow you 
to be my shield?&quot; Rei inquired. &quot;The pilot manning the shield will most 
likely die. I am more expendable than you are.&quot;

&quot;What are you on about?&quot; Ranma growled. &quot;Geez, the old geezer really 
mind-fucked you, didn&#39;t he? Let me tell you somethin&#39;, Rei, you are no 
more expendable than any other person at NERV, most especially that 
worthless scumbag that runs this show.&quot;

&quot;You are wrong,&quot; Rei said calmly. &quot;I am easily replaced.&quot;

&quot;Not to me you aren&#39;t,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;To the Old Fart, we are all easily 
replaced, but I value you, Rei. You are important to me as a friend. 
Regardless of how much more skilled I am than you, it&#39;s that very skill 
that makes me the right person for this detail. It would be a waste of 
my skills and your life for this to happen the way they initially 
planned it.&quot;

&quot;I disagree,&quot; Rei said tonelessly.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s a good thing for both of us you ain&#39;t in charge then, ain&#39;t 
it?&quot; Ranma laughed, shooting the blue-haired girl a roguish grin. &quot;You 
just concentrate on doing your thing and don&#39;t worry about me so much. 
We&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

The blue-haired girl sat silently for a few more minutes as the lights 
in the city below went out due to the power being diverted. Ranma sat 
watching her with a slight smile until Rei stood.

&quot;It is time,&quot; Rei said softly.

Ranma nodded and stood as well.

&quot;Good luck, Rei,&quot; Ranma said sincerely.

&quot;Goodbye...Ranma,&quot; Rei said morbidly.

The pair walked down the gantry and entered their Evas.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei took her position, prone behind the super-sized sniper rifle as the 
massive power capacitors being fed by all the electrical power in Japan 
began to charge up. Transformers crackled with energy as the field of 
coolant towers began to spool up to wick away the excess heat being 
produced. Rei reached up and deployed her targeting hood, drawing a bead 
on the angel.

&quot;Positron laser at 80 percent capacity and climbing,&quot; a tech reported 
over the comm. &quot;Coolant towers functioning nominally.&quot;

Rei watched the charge indicator crawl upwards as her targeting computer 
registered a target lock.

&quot;Picking up an energy buildup from the target!&quot; a tech said in an urgent 
tone.

Suddenly, Rei&#39;s sight picture was obscured, frantically she looked out 
from beneath the hood to find out what was wrong. She saw Unit 01 
standing in her line of fire, a slight mist forming around the purple 
Eva.

&quot;Ranma, please remove yourself from my line of fire,&quot; Rei got out before 
the angel fired its weapon.

The particle beam stabbed out and struck the heat shield just as Rei&#39;s 
charge indicator hit the fully charged mark.

&quot;Fire, Rei!&quot; Misato said at the same time.

&quot;I cannot,&quot; Rei declined. &quot;Ranma has stepped in front of me and is 
currently blocking the angel&#39;s particle beam.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Misato shrieked.

&quot;Sorry, Misato,&quot; Ranma said, the strain evident in her voice as she used 
the Soul of Ice to cool the rapidly heating shield. &quot;Rei wasn&#39;t going to 
get a shot off before the angel. Rei, you just be ready. You&#39;re only 
going to get one shot. As soon as this beam stops, I&#39;ll drop out of the 
line of fire. If I fall, take the shot.&quot;

&quot;Affirmative,&quot; Rei&#39;s dispassionate voice replied.

Ten seconds went by and Ranma was moving the shield to avoid letting the 
beam concentrate on one point, something that Rei didn&#39;t know if she 
would have been strong enough to do. At thirteen seconds, the shield was 
beginning to glow the faintest hint of dull red in places. At twenty 
seconds the shield was glowing bright, cherry-red all over its surface. 
At twenty-five seconds, the shield failed and Ranma began to block the 
beam with her Eva. Thirty seconds after the beam began, Ranma began 
screaming as the armor was immolated from her Eva. Three seconds after 
that, the angel&#39;s particle beam stopped. Ranma allowed Unit 01 to fall 
forward down the hill.

With her line of fire clear and a target lock established Rei took her 
shot. The Positron Laser struck the angel at the tip of one of its 
horizontal points, blasting through and punching out the other side. The 
floating octahedron crashed to the ground, belching smoke and flames. 
Before it even touched the ground Rei brought Unit 00 to its feet and 
was running over to the fallen Eva.

Once there, she ripped the entry plug hatch off the Eva&#39;s upper back and 
carefully removed the plug. Ejecting her own plug, the blue-haired girl 
ran over to Ranma&#39;s entry plug. Quickly triggering the emergency LCL 
vent, Rei popped the emergency hatch, ignoring the fact that the handles 
were burning hot.

&quot;Ranma,&quot; the inexpressive girl called. &quot;Do you require assistance? 
Ranma, please respond.&quot;

Ranma groaned and began to move gingerly.

&quot;Owwwie,&quot; Ranma moaned. &quot;I hurt.&quot;

&quot;Of course you hurt,&quot; Rei informed her. &quot;You were subjected to 
temperatures and pressures outside the human body&#39;s ability to 
withstand. Please do not do such a thing again. I-I...felt extremely 
unpleasant watching you die.&quot;

Her red eyes held an intense look in them as they met Ranma&#39;s blue ones 
for a moment before they were directed downward. Ranma reached out and 
took Rei&#39;s hand in her own.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Ranma said softly. &quot;Thanks for caring.&quot;

&quot;You are welcome, Ranma,&quot; Rei said, her face feeling strangely warm.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Ranma smiled gently. &quot;Never say goodbye. Never give death a 
foothold in your mind, until you have no other choice. I&#39;m going to take 
a little nap now. I burned through way too much ki.&quot;

The blue-haired girl nodded silently as Ranma passed out. When the 
recovery teams got there, Rei was still holding the redhead&#39;s hand.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;How is he, Ritsuko?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;As far as I can tell, there&#39;s nothing wrong with him,&quot; Ritsuko replied. 
&quot;As near as I can tell, he&#39;s in some sort of meditative sleep. Rei said 
that he mentioned that he used up most of his &#39;ki&#39; resisting the 
particle beam. I imagine that he is in a restorative cycle of some 
kind.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s been two days,&quot; Misato complained.

&quot;That eager to have your chief cook and bottle washer back?&quot; Ritsuko 
teased.

&quot;I&#39;m just concerned, that&#39;s all,&quot; Misato said. &quot;But I have to admit, 
instant ramen ain&#39;t what it used to be.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I can understand that,&quot; Ritsuko laughed. &quot;Be careful though or 
your prize will get stolen out from under you.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Misato asked curiously.

&quot;Take a look,&quot; Ritsuko smirked, gesturing to the door to Ranma&#39;s room.

Misato poked her head in and was surprised to see Rei Ayanami dressed in 
her school uniform and seated calmly beside Ranma&#39;s bed apparently doing 
homework. Pulling back, Misato gave Ritsuko a querying look.

&quot;She&#39;s been right there the whole time,&quot; Ritsuko grinned. &quot;Even arranged 
for their school work to be dropped off here. I didn&#39;t think it was 
possible but my guess is our little Rei has taken a shine to Ranma.&quot;

&quot;Well, he is a little heartbreaker,&quot; Misato giggled. &quot;And he does have a 
certain charisma and charm about him, in a crude sort of way.&quot;

&quot;Oh my, Misato, plan on entering the competition for Young Ranma&#39;s 
affections?&quot; Ritsuko teased her dark-haired friend.

&quot;I&#39;m not a cradle-robber, Ritsuko,&quot; Misato replied. &quot;What about you? You 
seem to spend an awful lot of time with him yourself.&quot;

Ritsuko laughed lightly.

&quot;I do, don&#39;t I?&quot; Ritsuko smiled. &quot;He&#39;s a fascinating young man, and easy 
on the eyes as well. But no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be throwing my hat in 
that ring. Doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t look though.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Misato giggled. &quot;I walked in on him in the bath 
once. Believe you me, he was aptly named. Wild Horse indeed.&quot;

&quot;Just once, Misato?&quot; Ritsuko smirked.

Misato grinned and waved her finger at Ritsuko.

&quot;He seems to require an awful lot of physicals,&quot; Misato observed.

&quot;His body is like a high-performance sports car,&quot; Ritsuko sniffed 
haughtily, putting it in terms Misato could understand. &quot;It requires 
constant monitoring and maintenance to keep it in top form.&quot;

&quot;Riiight,&quot; Misato laughed knowingly.

(oO\O/Oo)

Rei sat quietly, patiently studying the chapters of her science book 
she&#39;d been assigned to read. Feeling eyes on her she looked over and saw 
that Ranma was awake, silently watching her. A light blush bloomed on 
her cheeks.

&quot;Hiya, Rei,&quot; Ranma said softly, his voice a little hoarse. &quot;How long 
have I been out?&quot;

&quot;This is the third morning since we destroyed the 5th angel,&quot; Rei 
replied impassively.

&quot;Have you been here the whole time?&quot; Ranma asked, a little surprised.

&quot;I wished to monitor your recovery,&quot; Rei advised. &quot;I have also secured 
your schoolwork that you missed.&quot;

Ranma&#39;s growing smile faded at that last tidbit and he groaned.

&quot;That was...um...real sweet of you, Rei,&quot; Ranma mentioned. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You are welcome, Ranma,&quot; Rei stated. &quot;Would you like some water?&quot;

&quot;Um...sure, in a glass, so I can drink it, not on me, so I can absorb it 
through my skin,&quot; Ranma smirked.

If Ranma had not been watching for it, he would have missed Rei&#39;s lips 
twitch into a fleeting smile. She put her book aside and poured him a 
glass of water from the pitcher on the table. Ranma accepted the glass 
and quaffed it down greedily.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ranma said, handing the glass back. &quot;You know, you&#39;re really 
cute when you smile.&quot;

Rei nearly dropped the glass before setting it on the table.

&quot;You&#39;re embarrassing me,&quot; Rei said, looking away and blushing darkly.

&quot;Nothin&#39; to be embarrassed about,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It&#39;s nice. You should 
smile more often.&quot;

Still blushing, she turned to him and gave him a small smile that seemed 
to make her face light up. Ranma graced her with one of his own 
heart-stopping grins.

&quot;I-I...should go inform Dr. Akagi that you have awoken,&quot; Rei said, 
nearly fleeing from the room.

Ranma chuckled. Yes, Rei was thawing nicely. By the time Ritsuko 
returned to the room with Rei following along behind her, Ranma had 
already located the phone and called the cafeteria, ordering enough food 
to feed at least ten people.

The first of it was being brought in as Ritsuko examined him. Ritsuko 
goggled at the amount of food that was arriving.

&quot;Planning on having a party, Ranma?&quot; the blonde asked. It hit Ranma that 
Ritsuko was a lot like Nabiki, only nicer, with the way she drawled 
those teasing questions.

&quot;Nah, I used up a lot of ki. I need a lot of food to restore my 
reserves,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;But you two are welcome to join me if you 
want. I can always order more.&quot;

&quot;I might have a little bit,&quot; Ritsuko agreed, completing her exam.

&quot;So what&#39;s the verdict, Doc?&quot; Ranma joked. &quot;Is it terminal?&quot;

&quot;Not this time, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Ritsuko laughed. &quot;You&#39;ll be back in 
Misato&#39;s clutches by this afternoon. However, the next time you might 
not be so lucky.&quot;

&quot;Like I told Misato; I ain&#39;t never had no good luck. I prefer to rely on 
skill,&quot; Ranma quipped.

&quot;Well, skill is a bit more dependable than luck,&quot; Ritsuko agreed. &quot;And 
you seem to have it in spades. I think you&#39;ll be alright.&quot;

Ranma smiled as he tore into his breakfast with zeal. As he ate, Ranma 
reflected on the irony that he had to come to a fictional world and 
become involved in a life and death struggle to get a little peace and 
make a few friends. He was actually enjoying himself here. Of course it 
helped that he actually knew what was going on here, where as at home he 
was frequently clueless except for the gnawing certainty that everyone 
back home was out to make his life as hellish as possible. It didn&#39;t 
help that they all wanted opposing things from him and didn&#39;t give a 
rat&#39;s ass what he wanted, instead, blackmailing him emotionally, by 
using his sense of honor, or just plain blackmailing him.

Here he didn&#39;t have any of those conflicts. He had one goal, save the 
world, and everybody was more or less onboard with that. Not that he was 
under any illusion that things would continue on as nicely as they were. 
He knew things would get ugly toward the end, but he also knew that 
there wasn&#39;t one person in the show that had their head screwed on 
straight. He was building a rapport with the people around him and if he 
could anchor them when things got tough and began to fall apart, Ranma 
was certain there would be a much different outcome.

Finishing his meal some minutes later and feeling invigorated, Ranma 
turned his attention back to the two women.

&quot;So what&#39;s on the agenda for today, Dr Akagi?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Well, you are staying in this bed for the rest of the afternoon,&quot; the 
blonde informed him. &quot;You need the rest. I&#39;ll check you out again this 
afternoon and if everything still looks good, I&#39;ll send you home with 
Misato.&quot;

Ranma winced at the mention of Misato.

&quot;She&#39;s not too mad at me, is she?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Not that I know of,&quot; Akagi denied. &quot;She is pretty concerned about you. 
She&#39;s been down to check on you as often as she can. Once she finds out 
your awake, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if I&#39;m treating you for cracked 
ribs.&quot;

Ranma rolled his eyes at that.

&quot;Well, you just get some rest,&quot; the doctor advised. &quot;Rei, you&#39;ll make 
sure he doesn&#39;t slip off to go beat on the Commander again or something, 
won&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Doctor, I will make sure Ranma remains here and rests,&quot; Rei said 
dispassionately. &quot;He has much classwork to get caught up on so that 
should keep him occupied.&quot;

&quot;Call if you need any help,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;Otherwise, I&#39;ll see you this 
afternoon.&quot;

&quot;Affirmative,&quot; Rei said.

After the doctor left, Rei sat down and began sifting through her papers 
with mechanical precision. Finally she located the stack she was looking 
for and handed them to Ranma. Ranma sighed and took them.

&quot;Ranma?&quot; Rei spoke hesitantly.

&quot;Yeah, Rei?&quot; Ranma said, looking up and meeting her red eyes.

&quot;I wish to accept your offer,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Um...which offer?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;I wish to be your friend and I also wish for you to train me in your 
art,&quot; Rei clarified.

&quot;You&#39;re already my friend, Rei,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;As for trainin&#39;, it&#39;ll 
be a pleasure. We can start anytime you like. One thing though, how do 
you feel about moving out of the place you&#39;re in? It&#39;s kinda ratty and 
you probably shouldn&#39;t be stayin&#39; in a place where the door is fallin&#39; 
off the hinges and stuff.&quot;

&quot;That was a reinforced steel door in good working order,&quot; Rei stated. &quot;I 
inspected it myself to ensure it provided adequate security.&quot;

&quot;Oh...um...sorry about that,&quot; Ranma said sheepishly. &quot;Anyway, the point 
was I always get in some practice before school. If you lived closer to 
Misato&#39;s place then we could meet in the mornings and get in some 
trainin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s this about Rei moving?&quot; Misato asked coming in the door.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m going to be trainin&#39; her in the art,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;I was 
askin&#39; her how she felt about moving closer so we could practice 
together in the mornin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a great idea,&quot; Misato smiled. &quot;You know, I do have a spare room 
at my place still. You could move in with us, Rei. Com&#39;ere you.&quot; Misato 
grabbed Ranma in a rib-crushing hug. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re okay. Good job 
out there. Both of you did a fantastic job.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Misato,&quot; Ranma gasped. Misato ruffled his hair as she let go. 
&quot;So how about it, Rei? You up for stayin&#39; at the Katsuragi home for the 
highly inebriated?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Inebriated&#39;?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;It means &#39;drunk&#39;,&quot; Ranma said with a smirk.

&quot;I know what it means, I&#39;m just surprised you know words that big,&quot; 
Misato smirked back. &quot;You didn&#39;t strain yourself with that one did ya?&quot;

Banter complete, both of them turned to look questioningly at Rei.

&quot;That would be adequate,&quot; Rei agreed.

&quot;Then it&#39;s settled,&quot; Ranma said cheerfully. &quot;We&#39;ll stop by and get your 
stuff on the way home this afternoon.&quot;

&quot;That would be acceptable,&quot; Rei stated.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Eva Unit 01 has sustained damage to 75 percent of its armor,&quot; Ritsuko 
reported to the two men, Gendo Ikari and Kozo Fuyutsuki in Gendo&#39;s 
office. &quot;Repairs will be completed in a week.&quot;

&quot;That will be acceptable,&quot; Gendo said from his standard, diabolical 
posture.

&quot;Also, while Unit 00 sustained no damage, our testing indicates that the 
Eva&#39;s performance is far below that of the other two active Eva units,&quot; 
the bottle-blonde scientist informed them. &quot;I recommend that as soon as 
repairs are completed to Unit 01, we take Unit 00 offline for the X-mod. 
The modifications will take about two months, but they should greatly 
improve Unit 00&#39;s performance.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have the funding for that,&quot; Fuyutsuki argued. &quot;The UN has 
refused our requests for budget increases and they are funneling some of 
the funds that should have been coming to us to this new project, Jet 
Alone.&quot;

&quot;Do not worry about that,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;NERV is the only hope to defeat 
the angels and the UN will see that soon enough. As soon as Unit 01 is 
back online, begin the modifications to Unit 00. In the meantime, I will 
put more pressure on NERV Germany to release Unit 02 and its pilot to 
us. By now it&#39;s clear that the angels are only attacking here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll begin preparations,&quot; Ritsuko said and left the office.

&quot;What of our funding?&quot; Fuyutsuki asked.

&quot;It will be taken care of once the UN sees what a spectacular failure 
this rival project is,&quot; Gendo said ominously.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Misato, Rei and I are going shopping,&quot; Ranma announced. &quot;You got any 
suggestions on where the best place to look for clothes is?&quot;

Misato blinked. Ranma hated shopping for anything but food and she just 
couldn&#39;t wrap her mind around Rei as a fashion bug. This was something 
she had to be in on.

&quot;I know a few places,&quot; Misato grinned. &quot;Going out to buy your girlfriend 
a cute outfit for your date?&quot;

&quot;It ain&#39;t like that,&quot; Ranma said, blushing. &quot;Rei just needs some clothes 
that she can train in. While it&#39;s good to be able to fight in what you 
wear all the time, her options are a little limited. She only owns four 
school uniforms, two bathing suits, and her plug suit. I don&#39;t want her 
to ruin her uniforms training so we&#39;re gonna get her some workout 
clothes.&quot;

&quot;Well, lets go then,&quot; Misato grinned broadly, chugging the rest of her 
beer and splashing Ranma with some water. &quot;We can make it a girl&#39;s day 
out!&quot;

&quot;Misato...&quot; Ranma growled warningly, but was ignored.

&quot;It&#39;ll be fun!&quot; Misato said cheerfully, grabbing for her keys.

Ranma snatched them before Misato.

&quot;Okay, but I&#39;m driving,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;After all you&#39;ve been drinking 
all morning.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and?&quot; Misato demanded to know the point.

Ranma just grinned and jingled the keys before turning and heading to 
the door with Rei in tow.

&quot;Coming Misato?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Misato said, grabbing her purse and following the two 
younger girls.

Ranma drove and Misato gave directions. By the time they reached the 
mall, both of them were grinning like maniacs while Rei sat in the 
backseat looking a little frazzled, but as stoic as ever.

&quot;Almost there, Kiddo,&quot; Misato said cheerfully. &quot;In another few months, 
you&#39;ll be almost as good a driver as me. Nice parking technique too.&quot;

Rei sweat-dropped in spite of herself. Ranma had done a 180 degree 
emergency brake skid across two lanes of traffic and had come to rest 
perfectly parallel parked between two other cars.

&quot;Thanks, Misato,&quot; Ranma chirped. &quot;I had a good teacher.&quot;

Rei&#39;s sweat-drop grew as they exited the car and headed into the 
building.

&quot;Anyway, I know just where we need to go first,&quot; Misato said taking the 
lead.

Ranma and Rei followed along behind the enthusiastic older woman as she 
cut her way through the afternoon mall crowds like a woman on a mission. 
Ranma about had a coronary as she saw where Misato was heading. Misato 
looked over her shoulder and smirked at them as she entered the lingerie 
shop.

&quot;Rei, you go on with Misato,&quot; Ranma suggested. &quot;I&#39;ll just wait out here 
for you guys to...&quot;

Ranma was cut off as Misato reappeared and snagged her arm, dragging her 
in the store.

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it, Ranma, sweetie,&quot; Misato said sweetly. &quot;You 
need some stuff too. I noticed you don&#39;t ever wear a bra, even when you 
have to be in that form for a while, and you, young lady, are entirely 
too top heavy to run around without one. You at least need a sports bra 
for when you train. It&#39;ll be much more comfortable. Believe me, I know.&quot;

Misato thrust her own well-developed chest out for emphasis.

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Ranma sighed in resignation.

(oO\O/Oo)

Misato had successfully talked Ranma into buying a selection of sports 
bras in plain colors and a few additional pairs of panties, less plain 
than the ones she currently owned, but the fact that they were called 
&#39;boy-cut&#39; seemed to appeal to her. Misato also managed to coax her into 
buying a few sets of sleepwear, mostly cute flannel shorts that 
resembled boxers and matching tops much like Misato herself preferred to 
sleep in. After that, the older woman let the redhead off the hook to 
concentrate on Rei.

While Ranma was standing near the register, trying to look as 
unobtrusive as possible, Misato led Rei around the store looking at 
things.

&quot;What do you think of this, Rei?&quot; Misato asked holding up a set matching 
bra and panties made of pure, white lace. &quot;These would look really cute 
on you.&quot;

Rei contemplated the proffered items impassively.

&quot;They do not seem very durable,&quot; Rei said at last.

&quot;That&#39;s not a consideration,&quot; Misato giggled. &quot;I bet Ranma would love to 
see you in these.&quot;

&quot;Ranma would like them?&quot; Rei asked dispassionately.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Misato grinned. &quot;If Ranma saw you in this set, he&#39;d be putty 
in your hands.&quot;

Rei considered this. She had done some research in the last few days and 
she now understood that the strange effects she had been experiencing 
with Ranma were do to the fact that her body saw him as a desirable 
potential mate. He would give her strong children and he would be able 
to protect her and their offspring. She had also learned that males were 
visually stimulated to a larger degree than females. Misato was saying 
that the items she was holding would assist her in Ranma seeing her as a 
desirable potential mate. A light blush bloomed on her cheeks as she 
contemplated to where that would lead.

Misato&#39;s grin broadened as she watched the girl work through her thought 
process. She knew she had the younger girl hooked now. Rei&#39;s wardrobe 
was about to expand by several orders of magnitude. Poor Ranma wouldn&#39;t 
stand a chance.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Geez,&quot; Ranma said tiredly as they stuffed the innumerable bags into 
Misato&#39;s car. &quot;I only wanted to get Rei some work out clothes, not buy 
out the store.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be such a spoil-sport, Ranma,&quot; Misato smirked. &quot;Besides, Rei 
needed stuff to wear besides her school uniform and workout clothes. Now 
don&#39;t you think she looks cute?&quot;

Ranma looked over at Rei...again. She had a hard time not looking at the 
blue-haired girl in her new outfit. Rei was wearing a short, pale pink 
top and a pair of snug, white shorts along with a pair of strappy 
sandals on her feet. Rei blushed and looked down under Ranma&#39;s regard.

&quot;Yeah, you look really good, Rei,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;That outfit looks 
really cute on you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Ranma,&quot; Rei said softly, her blush increasing.

For Rei&#39;s part, she was having a hard time containing herself. The way 
Ranma looked at her filled her with unfamiliar feelings, good feelings. 
It was becoming extremely difficult for her to maintain her reserve. 
Gendo had taught her, by example, to always be reserved and ignore her 
emotions, but more and more, since Ranma had come, she had begun to 
wonder if Gendo&#39;s reserve was simply because he was empty inside, devoid 
of happiness and emotionally numb.

In contrast, Ranma seemed full of emotions. He wore them on his face, 
plain to everyone. He seemed so full of life and exuberance, unwilling 
to let things get the better of him. Rei doubted that she could ever be 
that open with her feelings, but she did find that part of the pleasure 
she felt around Ranma was that openness.

Thinking about this, Rei concluded that Ranma would enjoy her company 
more if she too were to become a little more open. She resolved to work 
on just that. Looking up at the pigtailed redhead, she allowed the smile 
she had found herself suppressing to bloom on her face. The happy smile 
that Ranma returned made the effort well worth it.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;My son is so manly!&quot; Nodoka sang as she whipped out her victory fans 
and did her happy dance.

The fianc&eacute;es were considerably less happy as it had become clear that 
their fianc&eacute; had officially acquired yet another girl chasing him. Worse 
yet, they couldn&#39;t do a thing to discourage her. And worst of all, he 
seemed to be responding to her.

&quot;Shampoo kill strange, husband-stealer girl,&quot; Shampoo grumbled.

&quot;How ya gonna do that, Sugar,&quot; Ukyo asked. &quot;We&#39;re losing Ranma to a 
fictional character. I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;

&quot;She can have the perverted jerk for all I care,&quot; Akane growled, her 
glowing battle aura and the way she fingered her mallet gave lie to her 
words.

&quot;Waaaah, the schools will never be joined,&quot; Soun wailed.

Nabiki just shook her head in amusement as she watched the floor show.</pre>
