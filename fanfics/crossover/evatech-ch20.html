<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 20 of 29)</h1>

<a href="../crossover/evatech-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>&quot;What are they doing, Exedore?&quot; Breetai mused, metal
gleaming off the giant&#39;s faceplate. Together the
Zentradi watched as supply ships went back and forth
to the SDF-1, even as various images from this
planet&#39;s broadcasts flickered on various screens.

&quot;They appear to be readying to leave,&quot; Exedore said
calmly, the smaller Zentradi looking up to meet his
gaze.

&quot;Which is insane,&quot; Breetai shook his head, &quot;especially
considering what it likely cost them in mecha and
troops to get here.&quot;

Exedore smiled faintly as he reminded his commander,
&quot;We are often given orders by the Masters which don&#39;t
make sense at the time.&quot; A faint shrug, &quot;It could be
that these micronians have their own version of the
masters.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Breetai made a non-committal sound from the
back of his throat. Tapping his finder restlessly he
asked, &quot;Have you made any progress with the
broadcasts?&quot;

&quot;Some, sir,&quot; Exedore conceded, &quot;we&#39;ve accessed several
battle records, a number of which are quite
disturbing.&quot;

Several films came up on various screens, including
martial arts pictures, and in most the micronians
depicted used energy as casually as a hand weapon.
Breetai frowned as he asked, &quot;Is this the effects of
Protoculture?&quot;

With a grim smile Exedore said, &quot;Unknown, sir. Nor can
I say why they have not used such skills in battle.&quot;

&quot;It would explain that devastating force wave attack
they hit us with,&quot; Breetai murmured thoughtfully,
unknowingly referring to the barrier system overload.
With a possibly grimmer look he added, &quot;And what of
Khyron?&quot;

&quot;Still in custody after his last unauthorized attack
on the SDF-1,&quot; Exedore replied.

&quot;Do they still call him the Backstabber?&quot; Breetai
asked bleakly.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Exedore nodded. &quot;What would you like to do
with him?&quot;

&quot;We need to understand this mysterious power of theirs
better, Exedore,&quot; Breetai mused. With a frown he
finally said, &quot;Release Khyron from the brig and
restore his troops to full strength. He is leading the
next assault.&quot;

&quot;Is that wise sir?&quot; Exedore dared to ask even as the
crew raced to work.

&quot;No,&quot; Breetai answered, &quot;but it may give us a better
gauge of their strength.&quot; A pause, &quot;As well as
eliminating Khyron, hopefully.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see to it,&quot; Exedore bowed.

Breetai turned back to the screen, gazing out at Zor&#39;s
ship to hide any signs of his own confusion. He had
battled against this ship for months but he felt no
closer to understanding the enigmatic beings who
crewed it. The only thing he did know was that they
had earned his respect.... that ship and it&#39;s valiant
captain that he so looked forward to meeting.


On the bridge of the SDF-1, Misato sneezed suddenly.
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said, sitting slouched in her
captain&#39;s chair as usual.

&quot;Are you coming down with a cold?&quot; Maya asked, her
short, boyishly styled brown hair falling into her
eyes.

&quot;No,&quot; Misato pulled her cap down over black hair.

&quot;Then maybe somebody&#39;s talking about you,&quot; Ritsuko
offered, the blonde typing away at one of the bridge
stations.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Misato grunted.

All around them the bridge was busy, young men and
women working away. Bridge panels were open as
modifications were made, supplies were being tallied
and the ongoing preparations for departure continued.
Despite the wind outside the ship barely rocked with
the waves, internal systems holding it steady as a
rock.

&quot;Maya, did you enter the pageant yet?&quot; Misato asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Maya sighed, &quot;but I was hoping you&#39;d change
your mind.&quot;

Misato chuckled, &quot;Well, at least you&#39;re not the only
RDF officer in the pageant.&quot;

&quot;I was a bit surprised by it being Rei Ayanami,&quot;
Ritsuko calmly noted, &quot;she just doesn&#39;t seem the type,
somehow.&quot;

&quot;My understanding is that the female pilots drew
straws to decide,&#39; Makoto said from where the young
man was working with a few of the bridge bunnies.

&quot;That, I can believe,&quot; Maya agreed.

Still slouched with her cap concealing her eyes Misato
said, &quot;I want two other events factored into the
pageant. We&#39;ll need to clear it with the shows
producers, but I don&#39;t see there being any
insurmountable problems.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

With a sigh Misato said, &quot;Right after the pageant is
when we make the announcement that we&#39;re leaving
Earth.&quot; She smiled grimly, &quot;I figure that everyone
will be in the best mood they&#39;re going to get at that
point.&quot;

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Maya nodded thoughtfully, &quot;and what&#39;s
the other thing, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to marry you two on live TV,&quot; Misato said
simply.

There was silence for a beat then both Maya and
Ritsuko blurted, &quot;What?!&quot;

Misato pushed her cap up to reveal faintly amused eyes
as she murmured, &quot;I knew you were going to say that.&quot;

&quot;But why..?&quot; Ritsuko blinked.

Misato calmly said, &quot;You two were already planning
something big, not to mention how many crew would want
to attend.&quot;

&quot;But not this big,&quot; Maya said faintly.

Ritsuko steadied her gently, &quot;You all right?&quot;

&quot;Just surprised, sempai,&quot; Maya murmured.

&quot;After I announce that the civilians can&#39;t leave
they&#39;re going to look at the RDF as monsters,&quot; Misato
sat up, pushing her cap back, &quot;even with Maya and Rei
competing. The wedding will at least remind people
that we&#39;re human beings too, and hopefully prevent
anything rash.&quot;

&quot;Way to lay the guilt on, Captain,&quot; Ritsuko put a
bitter bite into the final word.

&quot;I won&#39;t make you do this,&quot; Misato said mildly, &quot;I
have no right to order you to.&quot; Her voice hardened,
&quot;But by damned I will do everything in my power to
make sure this ship stays a functioning entity until I
ca get everyone home.&quot;

&quot;Again,&quot; Makoto added with a sigh.

Maya was surprised at the silent appeal in Misato&#39;s
eyes, then turned to meet Ritsuko&#39;s torn gaze. Taking
a deep breath she said, &quot;Give us some time to think
about it, please. This is a big step up from borrowing
the mess hall and getting married there.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Misato nodded. Choosing to change the
subject she asked, &quot;Have the volunteer replacement
pilots we asked for come aboard?&quot;

&quot;I believe the last group should be coming aboard
today,&quot; Maya said with relief, consulting a schedule
on her workstation.

&quot;Good,&quot; Misato flashed a grin, &quot;I want the new pilots
settling down with their wings as quickly as possible.
We may need them soon enough.&quot;


Out on the flight deck a group of officers left the
transport, walking into the opening where some of the
Evangelion aircraft would launch. Standing out in the
crowd was a tall, black haired young man with an oddly
serene manner to him. He paused, looking up into the
blue sky....

&quot;Yo, Kyle!&quot; a fellow pilot called.

&quot;Coming,&quot; Lynn Kyle, cousin to Lynn Minmei, hurried to
rejoin his fellows, following them into the SDF-1 and
his new home.</pre>
