<h1>The Accidental Goddess</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/roeder.html">D.F. Roeder</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Based on the story idea, New Life 1/2, by G. E. Jordan, Jr., and used with 
his kind permission. Thanks for your ongoing interest in this project.
Many thanks and deep bows to Vince Seifert for his expertise in 
networking, manga, character knowledge, and writing in general - this 
would be a much poorer work without him. [If you haven&#39;t read his The 
Taming of the Horse, you should be drawn and quartered. :)]

	-------------------------------------------

     A twittering in the bowels of the complex alerted the huntress that 
she was closing in on her prey. She stealthily moved down an aisle lined 
on both sides with innumerable computer memory banks. At the end of the 
aisle a spiral staircase led down to a powerline junction. As she reached 
the bottom of the staircase she bumped her head on the thick overhead 
conduit.
     &quot;ITEEEE... umph!&quot; She slapped her hands over her mouth, hoping 
against hope that she hadn&#39;t alerted the prey to her presence. Another 
series of twitters, much closer now, told her she&#39;d been lucky. She 
silently thanked Kami-sama that she&#39;d done those personnel file changes as 
a favor to the Goddess of Luck. She resumed her stalking, her face 
illuminated by the pulsing conduits in a random sequence of blue, green, 
and red.
     She stopped after a moment and waited. A scuffling noise brought her 
attention to a side room off the main walkway. Written in the heavenly 
script, a sign affixed to the wall next to the door proclaimed, 
&quot;Asgard-Midgard Data Uplink Relay Station - Section 43, Level 37, 
Compartment 23.&quot; She paused as she noticed the trio of prime numbers 
comprising the physical location of the relay room. Because of her 
inherently mathematical mind, she took a moment to decide whether or not 
to ignore this fact.
     Her people had a healthy respect for portents and omens, a respect 
learned through several lifetimes of experience... mostly bad. A 
significant lack of such experience during her 12 years of existence told 
her that it couldn&#39;t possibly mean anything, so she entered the room.
     She shook her head as she realized that this was one of the areas of 
the complex that was overdue for a millennial upgrade. It was dark, but 
the red in-use lights on the relay panels cast a hazy and indistinct 
illumination. The floor was littered with old cables, making navigation 
somewhat treacherous. The banks of data relays resembled nothing so much 
as oversized old-style telephone switchboards; double-ended patch cords 
connected the data lines from one plane of existence to another. She 
shuddered to be in the presence of such old technology.
     Putting those concerns aside, she scanned the room. The bright white 
coloration of her prey made it stand out like a beacon. It had obviously 
gnawed through several patch cords on the far wall and was chewing on 
another. The huntress set herself, a manic grin on her face, and began to 
edge around the room.
~~~~~~~
     &quot;What did I say you had to do for me? I mean for this?&quot; An elegantly 
beautiful teenaged woman with warm dark brown hair, cut to resemble a 
helmet, gestured smoothly at the computer in front of her and gave a wry 
grin as she glanced at her companion. Round black eyes twinkled in a face 
the color of creamed coffee.
     &quot;Hey! This was your idea! &#39;Something to pass the time,&#39; you said, 
Nabiki.&quot; The companion, another teenaged woman, huffed and puffed in 
reflexive outrage. She was also beautiful, but where the first was 
elegant, the companion was exotic. Very large almond-shaped blue eyes sat 
in a petite elfin face. Alabaster skin was set off stunningly by hair so 
red it gave new meaning to the description. Both women had figures to die 
for.
     &quot;Sorry, Ranma... or should I say &#39;Ranko&#39;? I have to keep the money 
rolling in,&quot; Tendo Nabiki smirked.
     Saotome Ranma gave Nabiki a baleful glare. &quot;Let&#39;s just get on with 
it. Okay?&quot;
     &quot;Jeez, Ranma. You could take the fun out of a bowl of ice cream.&quot;
     Nabiki turned back to her computer and waited while the Internet 
log-on finished. The assorted chirps, whistles, and blats of interfacing 
modems could be heard emanating from the machine. Her ISP main page came 
up, and Nabiki highlighted the URL navigation bar and began typing in the 
first of a series of numerical IP addresses.
     &quot;Okay. There&#39;s this person who&#39;s a friend of a friend of a person who 
still owes me big yen. This person has certain connections that allow for 
identities to be constructed. Of course, this isn&#39;t the big time, so these 
ID&#39;s won&#39;t hold up under a thorough check, but they will do in a pinch. 
Just don&#39;t get caught. If someone starts to do a check, grab your ID and 
hightail it out of there. Ne?&quot;
     Ranma began to feel a little nervous. &quot;I thought this was just for 
fun.&quot;
     Nabiki answered with just a smile as she continued to advance through 
deeper levels of the server she was currently accessing.
     A screen came up showing a number of empty database fields. &quot;Want a 
library card?&quot;
     &quot;What for?&quot;
     &quot;Good point.&quot; Nabiki squinted at the next address on her handwritten 
list. &quot;Does that first number look like a &#39;1&#39; or a &#39;2&#39; to you?&quot;
     Ranma eyeballed the scribbles. &quot;Beats me.&quot;
     &quot;Well... it looks more like a &#39;2&#39; to me.&quot; She typed 299.43.37.23 into 
the URL field. The status bar read:
  TCP/YP gateway active. Contacting uplink...
~~~~~~~
     The huntress took her weapon out of its holder and hefted it, testing 
the feel and weight. She was almost in range. Steady... Steady...
     She stepped on the plug-end of a cable, and the housing broke with an 
audible snap. The prey whirled around, then bounced off the panel and 
began to head for the entrance. Unfortunately, the huntress was already 
too close. She pressed a button, and the head of the weapon extended as 
she brought it down in an arc precisely impacting the prey on the cranium. 
Its eyes crossed, and the entire creature vanished with a &#39;pop&#39;.
     &quot;YES!! I am a GENIUS!&quot; Skuld, Norn Goddess of the Future and debugger 
extraordinaire, hopped around in glee. &quot;That was the last one. Yay! I can 
go home, now. No more bugs for me, no more bugs for me, no more...&quot; She 
wilted when she saw the damage the bug had caused, but upon closer 
inspection she decided that it wasn&#39;t so bad. All she needed to do was 
replace some patch cords.
     She gathered a few of the loose cables off the floor and walked to 
the damaged panels. Skuld smiled when she saw that although the 
chewed-through cable ends were hanging loosely, the damaged connections 
were in close enough proximity that she could easily tell which two data 
lines were supposed to connect - the cables weren&#39;t long enough to 
accommodate any other possibilities. She proceeded to repair the damage.
     When she got to the last damaged connection, she had a problem. The 
bug had managed to yank one of the cable ends out of the board. She bent 
down, picked up an undamaged cable, and stared at the board. There were 
several empty jacks, but there was no clear indication of where the plug 
had been. She peered closely at the numbers embossed in the metal over the 
empty jack holes.
     &quot;198... 213... 220... 256... 277... 299... 313... GAH! I&#39;m not 
getting anywhere. TERMINAL!&quot; A holographic computer interface materialized 
in front of the diminutive goddess. It looked similar to a laptop, but it 
was translucent and appeared intangible as it hovered in midair. Password 
blinked above an empty text field, and Skuld entered her email address. 
Remembering passwords was not one of her many talents, and she made life 
as simple as possible in that respect. Access Granted flashed up, and she 
began typing at an ungodly (or perhaps godly) speed. Soon, she had the 
history in line graph form of the past use of all the open lines on the 
panel she was repairing. None showed any use in the last 200 years, but 
subnet line 299 had a red indicator denoting a real-time current access 
attempt.
     Skuld jumped for joy, &quot;Luckeee!&quot; and quickly stepped over to put the 
new cable in place. She pulled the remaining damaged line out and plugged 
one end of the new cable into the same jack.
     Unseen by Skuld, the indicator for subnet 299 disappeared from the 
computer terminal, and the message bar next to it now read:
  Incoming Midgard access status: awaiting authentication. Relay station 
  supervisory mode in effect. Press Cancel or say &#39;No&#39; to terminate 
  connection. Press Enter or say &#39;Yes&#39; to authenticate.
     With a big grin Skuld slammed the other end of the cable into jack 
299. &quot;YES!&quot; she exclaimed in joy.
  Access approval logged: Skuld, Goddess, Category 2, Class 2, Limited.
     &quot;Terminal off!&quot; Skuld left the newly repaired patch panel and moved 
to pick up her debugging hammer. Pressing the button on the handle again, 
she watched the weapon retract into its normal size. She slipped the 
handle end into the carrier on her back and shoved it home with 
satisfaction. Images of 131 Flavors danced in her head as she left the 
relay room.
     The red in-use light for subnet data line 299 glowed.
~~~~~~~
     Ranma locked her hands behind her head and leaned back in the chair. 
&quot;What&#39;s takin&#39; so long?&quot;
     &quot;Patience. Sometimes these unnamed server addresses are buried deep 
and you have to wait to get access.&quot;
     &quot;What&#39;s a server, anyway?&quot; Ranma asked while staring at the ceiling.
     Nabiki rolled her eyes. &quot;Saotome, do you know anything about the 
modern world?&quot;
     Ranma scowled as she cracked her spine across the back of the chair. 
&quot;Excuse ME for bein&#39; on a ten-year trainin&#39; trip.&quot;
     Nabiki looked at the redhead as she continued to arch her back and 
smirked. &quot;By the way, Ranma. Nice tits.&quot;
     &quot;Thanks. I... WHAT?!&quot; Ranma sat forward with a stunned look. Nabiki 
was having a hearty laugh.
     &quot;You&#39;re too easy, WAY too easy,&quot; Nabiki chortled.
     Ranma huffed, but then grinned evilly. &quot;I seem to remember you likin&#39; 
&#39;em plenty.&quot;
     Now Nabiki looked a little stunned. &quot;Wha-WHAT?!&quot; For once, her 
ubiquitous cool slipped.
     &quot;HAHAHA! You seemed to enjoy grabbin&#39; me when I first got here. &#39;Does 
this look like a boy to you, Daddy?&#39; Squeeze, squeeze.&quot; Nabiki quickly 
found her center, but it took a little longer for the blush to recede and 
Ranma noticed. &quot;Well, well. Are you embarrassed? Or did you really enjoy 
it?&quot;
     &quot;Keep it up, Saotome. I haven&#39;t even BEGUN to dig into my hoard of 
goodies on you, yet.&quot;
     Ranma fidgeted nervously, the humor of the situation rapidly 
receding. &quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;ll have you know I... Ara?&quot;
     The screen on Nabiki&#39;s computer blacked out, and a very well done 
animated graphic began. What appeared to be a large seed sprouted and grew 
into an immense tree. Words faded into view below the tree, but it was 
written in a script Nabiki had never seen before. Before she could comment 
on the fact, the screen blacked out again and a message in mixed hiragana 
and katakana appeared.
  This terminal is not Yggdrasil direct-link compliant. Do you wish to use 
  an interface in the native language of your terminal?
     Nabiki clicked the &#39;Yes&#39; button.
     &quot;What&#39;s a Ygg..., um, a Ygg-thingy?&quot; Ranma stuttered.
     &quot;Not sure, but it seems familiar,&quot; Nabiki said.
     Another screen came up.
  Yggdrasil Personnel Database
  Please enter the name of the person for whom you are requesting a file 
  in the field below.
     Nabiki typed &#39;Saotome Ranko&#39; in the blank text box and hit ENTER.
  File not found. Please select one of the options below.
     Nabiki clicked on &#39;New File&#39;.
     A screen with database input fields appeared.
     &quot;Now we&#39;re getting somewhere,&quot; Nabiki exclaimed. Ranma&#39;s alternate 
name was already in the name field. Nabiki selected the button next to 
female, but stopped at the next blank field.
     &quot;&#39;Area of Influence&#39;?&quot; she said.
     Ranma shrugged. &quot;Martial Arts, I guess.&quot;
     Nabiki grinned wickedly as she considered a way to pay Ranma back 
somewhat for her embarrassment of a few minutes ago. She typed &#39;Sex&#39; in 
the blank field.
     &quot;HEY!&quot;
     &quot;Relax, Saotome. This has to be some kind of gag site. I mean, I&#39;ve 
never seen an official site look this slick.&quot;
     &quot;Well...&quot;
     &quot;Let&#39;s see... &#39;Category&#39;. One, two, or three?&quot;
     &quot;Uh... One!&quot;
     &quot;&#39;Class&#39;?&quot;
     &quot;One.&quot;
     &quot;&#39;Limited&#39; or &#39;Unlimited&#39;?&quot;
     &quot;&#39;Unlimited&#39;, of course. Anything goes, you know.&quot;
     Nabiki snorted. &quot;First class all the way, ne?&quot;
     &quot;Sure, and why not? With Pops around, things have always been last 
class.&quot;
     &quot;Point. &#39;Transport Medium&#39;?&quot;
     &quot;Uhhh... huh?&quot; Ranma peered at the screen.
     Nabiki hit the arrow on a drop-down box. &quot;Hmmm. Water, sunlight, 
reflective surfaces, electrical wiring... televisions? Blah, blah, 
blah.... Well, perhaps we should stay with a common theme for you.&quot; Nabiki 
selected &#39;Water&#39;.
     Ranma squirmed, but let it pass.
     &quot;&#39;Weapon&#39;?&quot;
     &quot;None.&quot;
     &quot;Not an option. See?&quot; The drop-down box didn&#39;t have a listing for 
&#39;None&#39;. &quot;There! &#39;Katana.&#39; HAHAHA! Talk about a theme!&quot;
     Ranma scowled. &quot;Having fun, Nabiki?&quot;
     &quot;Un! ...&#39;Age&#39;?&quot;
     &quot;Seventeen.&quot;
     &quot;Duh!&quot; Nabiki went on to fill in all the little personal details of 
Ranma&#39;s identification. When those fields had been completed only two 
remained. The first was a drop-down box with the caption, &#39;Affiliated 
Deity or Deities&#39;. Nabiki hit the down arrow, and she and Ranma scanned 
the selections.
     &quot;Who ARE these people?&quot; Ranma asked.
     &quot;They&#39;re mythological gods and goddesses. Ah! I remember, now. 
Yggdrasil was called the &#39;World Tree&#39; or something. It was part of Old 
Norse mythology.&quot;
     &quot;Old who?&quot;
     &quot;You know, Vikings?&quot;
     &quot;Oh... so which do I pick?&quot;
     &quot;Errr... Let&#39;s look a bit.&quot; Nabiki continued to scroll down. She 
eventually hit the Norse pantheon. One selection was titled &#39;Norns&#39;, and 
it listed three names. Nabiki&#39;s attention was drawn to a short line of 
blinking red text next to the first name.
    Also &quot;Cupid&quot; of Love. ~_^ -Urd.
     &quot;Here we go.&quot; Nabiki selected the &#39;Norns&#39;, which appeared in the 
field after the scroll list disappeared.
     &quot;Why them?&quot;
     &quot;Well... I did list you as the Goddess of Sex, and Love is close.&quot;
     Ranma scratched her belly. &quot;I don&#39;t know if we should do this,&quot; she 
said worriedly.
     &quot;Relaaax. This HAS to be a gag site, especially with all this 
mythology stuff. Ne?&quot;
     Ranma nodded. &quot;One more blank.&quot;
     The last field had the caption, &#39;Authorization&#39;. Nabiki humphed and 
studied the screen. On a hunch, she opened FILE: PROPERTIES. An inset 
screen with mountains of alphanumerical data came up. She slowly scrolled 
down, peering intently at the lines. She stopped and considered one line. 
She copied the line and canceled the screen. She pasted the information 
into the last field and hit ENTER.
     &quot;Probably won&#39;t work, but who knows?&quot;
~~~~~~~
     In another part of the Greater Tokyo metropolitan area, three young 
women and one young man sat at a table in the dining area of a Shinto 
temple grounds house. Two of the women had strange markings on their 
foreheads and cheeks, and both were incredibly beautiful. The third woman 
was cute and exuded a boundless energy evident in the rapid-fire 
conversation she was having with the young man, her brother. The young 
man, small in build but reasonably handsome, waved his hands in front of 
his sister&#39;s face.
     &quot;Megumi... Look, I... Really, they shouldn&#39;t have... Megumi... 
Megumi... MORISATO MEGUMI!&quot;
     Megumi stopped chattering and looked at her brother. &quot;Ne, Kei-chan? 
What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
     Morisato Keiichi took a deep breath and puffed. &quot;You won&#39;t let me get 
a word in edgewise, that&#39;s what&#39;s wrong.&quot;
     Megumi reached over and tweaked his cheek as the other women laughed. 
&quot;My, my! Aren&#39;t we a little temperamental today, brother?&quot;
     &quot;Sis, it&#39;s just that I have my hands full doing motorcycle 
drag-racing for the club. I don&#39;t have the time to take on funny cars. Do 
you understand?&quot; Keiichi pleaded.
     Megumi snickered. &quot;Well... I told Tamiya-sempai I would try. He seems 
to think you can do no wrong on the racetrack... any racetrack!&quot;
     Keiichi puffed up a little at the praise.
     &quot;Yeah,&quot; Urd, Norn Goddess of the Past, chimed in, &quot;unlucky in the 
bedroom, lucky on the racetrack.&quot;
     &quot;Oneesan!&quot; scolded the third woman, Belldandy, Norn Goddess of the 
Present. Belldandy and Keiichi were beet red, while Urd and Megumi 
giggled. The good-natured ribbing and conversation continued, unaware of 
anything untoward.
~~~~~~~
  Please indicate location of file subject.
     Ranma and Nabiki looked at each other and then back at the computer. 
Hesitantly, Nabiki began typing:
  Japan, Tokyo, Nerima Ward, Furinkan-cho, Tendo Dojo.
The computer digested this for a moment, and then an architectural 
schematic of the Tendo compound came up. Several blinking points were 
scattered throughout the diagram.
  Please indicate by clicking which of the detected individuals is file 
  subject.
     &quot;Creepy,&quot; Ranma muttered.
     &quot;No shit,&quot; Nabiki said. She moved the cursor over to her room, took 
her mental bearings, and placed the cursor over the blinking point 
representing Ranma. She looked at the redhead.
     &quot;Well?&quot;
     &quot;Heh, heh. Are you sure this is a gag site?&quot; Nabiki shook her head. 
Ranma fidgeted. &quot;Maybe we should forget this. This is really freakin&#39; me 
out.&quot;
     &quot;I am inclined to agree. Now, how do I... oops.&quot; Anyone familiar with 
mouse operation can tell you that even the slight weight of a finger is 
often enough to press a button. Ranma and Nabiki stared at the monitor in 
morbid fascination.
  File creation complete. Stand by for reality update.
     &quot;Uh... Nabiki? What does that mean?&quot;
     Nabiki opened her mouth to speak but abruptly closed it when the room 
began to shake. She now found something different to say. &quot;Earthquake!&quot;
     Ranma and Nabiki stumbled over the unsteady floor and stood 
underneath the doorframe to ride it out. The rumbling and shaking 
increased until they had to clap their hands over their ears. The activity 
abruptly ceased, however, and they slowly pulled their hands down.
     Ranma was the first to speak, &quot;What...,&quot; but didn&#39;t have the chance 
to finish as she was jerked off of her feet, flying through the air to 
hang suspended over the chair she had been sitting in earlier.
     &quot;Nabiki! Help-- UNGH!!&quot; Ranma arched her back as her body suddenly 
strained and stretched and a brilliant column of pure white light exploded 
into being around the floating girl. Nabiki cried out and shielded her 
eyes with her arm. The column crackled with energy for a moment and then 
dimmed to a vibrant blue. Nabiki lowered her arm to see Ranma slowly 
spinning within the column, arms out at an angle with fingers splayed and 
legs parted to shoulder width with toes pointing down. Her head was back 
as if being pulled, her mouth was open, and her sightless eyes stared up. 
Nabiki discovered that she was, for perhaps the first time in her life, 
truly terrified.
     A flash of white washed over the column and a distinct &#39;CRACK&#39; echoed 
in the very fabric of the room. Ranma&#39;s clothes disintegrated and swirls 
of misty white luminance gathered around her body. They slowly coalesced, 
resolving into an intricate robe, earrings, necklace, and fingerless 
gloves and toeless foot coverings. The clothing floated around Ranma as 
her red hair suddenly glowed and began to grow. It reached almost to her 
feet before it stopped and braided itself into one long rope. A broad and 
elaborately configured hair ribbon appeared and crowned the back of her 
head.
     When the last of the accoutrements were in place, another wash of 
white light raced around the blue column, but instead of disappearing, it 
entered the column, spinning faster as it spiraled in towards the center. 
The light swirled and collected into three distinct bands, the middle one 
larger than the others, gradually moving to encircle Ranma&#39;s head. The top 
band abruptly rushed in and touched just below Ranma&#39;s left eye, forming a 
glowing inverted triangle. The bottom band of light repeated the process 
for the right eye. The remaining band swirled for a few seconds more, and 
then rushed in to touch the center of her forehead, creating a symbol of 
two interlocking circles on a horizontal axis, half of each circle 
entwined with the other. Ranma jerked and strained even harder at the last 
contact, and a shimmering of many brilliant points of light densely 
covered the surface of her form.
     After about fifteen seconds the lights vanished and Ranma slumped 
forward, although she stayed suspended, spinning slowly. Nabiki thought 
that perhaps the event was over, but as she was about to move towards 
Ranma, a wind began to pick up in the room. The symbols on Ranma&#39;s face 
began to glow, and the interlocking circles started moving inward. Objects 
began to rise off of surfaces and collect in a rotating mass around the 
suspended girl, moving counter to her spin. When everything loose had 
joined the mass and her forehead circles had overlapped completely to 
become one solid, round mark, Ranma moaned and straightened.
     Her head fell back once again, and a single beam of intensely white 
light shot out of the glowing circle on her forehead, passing out of view 
through the ceiling. After a couple of seconds, the beam vanished, the 
whirling objects crashed to the ground, and Ranma slumped forward again. 
The forehead mark separated into its constituent circles, losing its 
brilliance. Ranma slowly drifted down until her toes were only a few 
inches from the floor, one leg slightly pulled up such that the hollow of 
one foot rested on the instep of the other. Her clothes continued to float 
around her as if she were under water.
     After several heartbeats of silence, Nabiki slowly rose and peered 
around at the mess. Familiar paths were traveled in her brain as she began 
to think about how Ranma was going to pay for this. That stopped when she 
realized Ranma hadn&#39;t actually made it to terra firma but was hovering 
over the floor. Ranma&#39;s clothes still floated around her. The material was 
of a shimmering green with water-blue-within-beige trim.
     Nabiki studied the floating woman carefully, noting and storing 
details. She had always considered Ranma&#39;s girl form to be cute, but 
something had changed. Ranma was now almost supernaturally beautiful, like 
a haunting song or a dream that one can&#39;t quite remember. Nabiki had to 
fight an urge to kneel.
     Some sixth sense kicked in and Nabiki realized she wasn&#39;t alone. 
Turning around she saw the entire household peering through the door at 
the levitating martial artist.
~~~~~~~
     The tableau in the old temple house was interrupted by a call from 
the bathroom. &quot;Tadaima! I&#39;m finally back!&quot; Skuld strode into the room. 
&quot;Did ya miss me?&quot;
     Belldandy rose to hug her younger sister, and Urd just barely managed 
to suppress a grin. &quot;Hey, squirt. What took you so long? Just a few bugs, 
ne?&quot; Urd smirked.
     Skuld rounded on her oldest sister. &quot;Just a FEW bugs?! I&#39;ll have you 
know I debugged 3,495 bugs, spread all over the system. That&#39;s what took 
so long. Think you could&#39;ve done better, Miss SysAdmin?&quot;
     Urd casually waved her hand in the air. &quot;Feh! I could&#39;a done it in 
week instead of two, squirt.&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t call me SQUIRT, you old hag!&quot;
     Urd rose from her seat. &quot;WHAT did you call me?!&quot;
     &quot;Sisters!!&quot; Urd and Skuld both quieted at Belldandy&#39;s word. She 
wasn&#39;t the oldest, but an irritated Belldandy wasn&#39;t worth experiencing. 
&quot;We&#39;re all back together again, and I don&#39;t... Oh...! What...?&quot; The three 
goddesses collapsed to the floor unconscious.
     Keiichi rushed to Belldandy while Megumi checked out Urd and Skuld. 
Keiichi patted Belldandy&#39;s face and her eyes fluttered open.
     &quot;What happened?!&quot; Keiichi asked.
     &quot;I... I don&#39;t know,&quot; Belldandy answered. The goddesses were all awake 
now and rising wearily to their feet. The phone abruptly rang in the hall.
     &quot;Guess who,&quot; Urd muttered.
     Keiichi helped Belldandy to the phone.
     &quot;Morisato residence. Hello, Kami-sama. What just happened? Yes.... 
Yes.... I see.&quot;
     Keiichi stood patiently and the rest of the household wandered over.
     &quot;Yes.... Oh, my! How did that happen? ...I see.&quot;
     To the listeners, Belldandy&#39;s always-pleasant demeanor gave nothing 
away and was beginning to irritate the oldest goddess.
     &quot;Yes, Kami-sama. I&#39;ll tell them. Thank you for calling. I love you, 
too. Bye.&quot; Belldandy hung up the phone and turned to the rest. &quot;Well, 
sisters, we have some work to do.&quot;
     Urd&#39;s patience finally ran out. &quot;Bell, what happened?!&quot;
     &quot;It seems we just added a new goddess to the ranks.&quot; Belldandy moved 
back to the living area and began to pick up tea things. The rest followed 
her like puppies.
     &quot;Okaaay,&quot; Urd said, &quot;that happens. But it usually doesn&#39;t cause the 
family to go &#39;night-night&#39;.&quot;
     &quot;Mmm. Yes, but the new addition went from mortal straight to Class I, 
Category I, Unlimited.&quot;
     The singing of crickets and a single bird call washed through the 
room, and then two goddesses simultaneously cried, &quot;WHAT?!?!&quot;
     &quot;Tha-tha-that&#39;s not possible!&quot; Skuld exclaimed. &quot;We have safeguards 
built into the Wish System to prevent it! I know, I put &#39;em there!&quot; She 
wrung her hands.
     &quot;Super Genius strikes again,&quot; Urd monotoned.
     &quot;HEY! Not my fault, bag lady!&quot; Skuld was turning purple as Urd 
snickered.
     &quot;Now, now, sisters. This wasn&#39;t processed through the Wish System. It 
came in from another direction,&quot; Belldandy said as she took the tea things 
into the kitchen.
     Urd and Skuld scratched their heads. &quot;The only Operators that have 
that have that kind of clearance are the three of us and Kami-sama,&quot; Urd 
mused. She whirled on Skuld. &quot;RRRRRAH!&quot;
     Skuld backpedaled, waving her hands in front of her face. &quot;I was here 
when it happened, right? Right?! Besides, I didn&#39;t do anything but debug 
and repair the damage they caused.&quot;
     Urd appeared slightly mollified at that.
     &quot;I hope you haven&#39;t unpacked, yet, Skuld,&quot; Belldandy called from the 
kitchen. &quot;Kami-sama wants you back for the investigation.&quot;
     Skuld was crestfallen. &quot;Awww, Oneesama! I just got home!&quot;
     &quot;This is important, Skuld.&quot; Belldandy re-entered the living room. 
&quot;You don&#39;t want to disappoint Him, do you?&quot;
     &quot;...nnnooooo...&quot; Skuld pouted. She turned and slouched back to the 
bathing room. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll see ya when I see ya.&quot;
     Belldandy turned to Urd. &quot;Sister, we have a new goddess to track 
down.&quot; Urd nodded. &quot;Have you ever been to the Tendo Dojo?&quot;
~~~~~~~
     Nobody seemed willing to enter the room, so it was left to Nabiki to 
approach the levitating Ranma. With no small amount of trepidation she 
slowly moved to within a couple of feet.
     &quot;Ranma?&quot; No response. Nabiki tentatively reached out a hand. There 
seemed to be a slight resistance in the air immediately surrounding Ranma, 
but it was negligible. Just before touching her, Nabiki pulled her hand 
back a little. Firming her resolve, she finally took hold of Ranma&#39;s hand. 
A slight tingle passed into Nabiki&#39;s fingers, and Ranma jerked awake with 
a gasp. Nabiki tried to pull away, but Ranma had her hand in a deathgrip.
     Ranma blinked her eyes a few times and then focused on Nabiki. Surges 
of desire washed through Ranma&#39;s body as she gazed at the brown-haired 
girl. Some of that feeling passed into Nabiki, and she could feel her body 
responding. Ranma leaned over and cupped Nabiki&#39;s face with her free hand, 
and Nabiki became even more aroused at the touch. Ranma gazed into her 
eyes.
     &quot;Oh, Nabiki.... You are so beautiful.&quot; Ranma slowly leaned forward, 
and Nabiki&#39;s legs began to tremble. Ranma gently kissed her, and Nabiki&#39;s 
knees buckled, but before she could hit the ground, Ranma gathered her up 
in her arms and continued her attentions. The kiss became hungry and 
desperate as mouths parted and tongues twined. Ranma massaged Nabiki&#39;s 
body where she held her.
     Ranma and Nabiki&#39;s tryst lasted for all of about five seconds, the 
strident clarion call of an unamused fianc&eacute;e breaking the spell.
     &quot;RANMA! You PERVERT!! What the HELL do you think you&#39;re doing with my 
sister!&quot; Tendo Akane, betrothed of the new goddess, suddenly found herself 
in the stratosphere of anger and well on her way to escape velocity.
     Ranma jerked her head back and blink-blinked. Nabiki lolled in her 
arms, completely lost to the world. Ranma looked at Akane. Akane glared at 
Ranma and began to stalk her way. Ranma looked down at Nabiki. Her eyes 
snapped into focus as she realized just what had occurred.
     &quot;WHAT am I DOING?!?! YAAAAAHHH!!!&quot; Fortunately, Ranma had drifted 
across the room to Nabiki&#39;s bed while she was otherwise occupied, 
responding perhaps to new and unknown instincts. Thus, when Ranma 
unceremoniously dumped the middle Tendo daughter out of her arms and began 
to buzz around the upper half of the room, Nabiki came to no harm.
     &quot;What&#39;s happening to me?! AAAAAAAAAHHHH!!&quot;
     The Tendo household, non-Tendos included, just stared as Ranma 
effortlessly defied the laws of gravity and wailed about her current state 
of affairs. The only exception was Akane. She brought out her No. 2 
MacGregor mallet and attempted to swat Ranma to the floor. Akane wasn&#39;t 
having an easy time of it, however. Ranma seemed to instinctively zip away 
just as the swing would have connected. Akane finally lost control of the 
hammer on the downstroke, and in her attempt to regain her grip, she 
unerringly guided the head straight to her left kneecap. Akane howled, 
grabbing the knee up and hopping around on her right foot. It created a 
driving counter-rhythm to the lazy swish of Ranma&#39;s robe rushing through 
the air.
     Current events caught up to the remaining two women. The shock of 
seeing Ranma flying through the air and dressed in VERY feminine clothing 
was finally too much. The last thought through Saotome Nodoka&#39;s mind 
before she fainted was, That&#39;s not very... man... ly..., and Kasumi just 
swooned (it seemed the proper thing to do at the moment). The women fell 
against each other and slid to the floor in a heap.
     The fathers, not even bothering with the ladies, beat a hasty path to 
the phone. Surprisingly, the Tendo patriarch, Soun, reached the phone 
first. He dialed and waited calmly.
     &quot;Hello? Dr. Tofu? Yes, could you come over right away? There seems to 
be a problem with Ranma. The nature of the problem? ......WAAAAAHHHHHHH! 
He&#39;s gonna fly away! The schools will never be joined, now! 
WA-WA-WAHAHAHAAAAAH!&quot;
     The Saotome patriarch, Genma, grabbed the phone away and began to 
speak. &quot;Tofu-sensei? Listen, Ranma is... Growf, growf, garooowww, growf!&quot; 
Soun&#39;s gushing tears had triggered Genma&#39;s curse, and Panda-chan began 
holding signs in front of the mouthpiece, occasionally growfing for 
emphasis.
     At the other end of the line, Ono Tofu rhythmically beat his head 
against the top of his desk. Two GROWN men. Oh, brother... He hung up, 
grabbed his black bag, and left for the Tendos&#39;.
