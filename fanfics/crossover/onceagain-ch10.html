<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 10 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/onceagain-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Tennyo Masaki smiled slightly as she strode up the
stone steps, the white haired woman looking oddly
ageless dressed in her business wear. She might be as
young as twenty or as old as forty, it was difficult
to tell from her mostly unmarked face and body. Of
course the truth would have shocked her dorm mates a
great deal.

The youthful looking Tennyo was in fact a hundred year
old half alien, her mother human while her father was
born on the planet Jurai. Raised on Earth in her youth
she had left home for Jurai, sending decades among
alien civilizations as a designer of star ships. Off
and on she had returned home, but only recently had
she decided to stay for a while.

&#39;Just like home,&#39; Tennyo thought fondly as she climbed
up the steps that were so like those at the Masaki
shrine where she had been born so long ago. If she was
going to be honest walking these stairs had been one
of the deciding factors in deciding on moving to the
Hinata Inn, that and it&#39;s convenience to her job.

&quot;Tennyo-san,&quot; a voice called out to her cheerfully as
she reached the top of the stairs. Mutsumi Otohime
smiled as she walked over to the white haired woman as
the busty woman asked, &quot;Back so soon?&quot;

&quot;Just had to go into town to check in on a client,&quot;
Tennyo explained as they casually fell into step. She
smiled slightly as she added, &quot;We can do a lot online,
but occasionally face to face meetings are a must.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Mutsumi agreed.

Tennyo smiled over at the young woman as she asked,
&quot;Is the caf&eacute; open? It occurs to me I missed
breakfast.&quot;

&quot;Come on then,&quot; Mutsumi impulsively took Tennyo&#39;s hand
as she pulled her towards the side of the inn complex,
&quot;let&#39;s get you fed.&quot;

The Hinata Caf&eacute; was beside the Inn, formerly run by
the owner&#39;s aunt before she got married. Now, it was
run by Kitsune, Mutsumi and Shinobu, and had become
very popular, in no small part to the attractive
qualities of the three ladies. Shinobu had a youthful
innocence, Mutsumi brought a motherly quality while
Kitsune seemed almost dangerously experienced. Add in
Kitsune&#39;s sharp business skills and they were doing
very well.

&quot;Yo, Tennyo,&quot; Kitsune nodded as she hurried to serve a
table of young men, &quot;you want your usual today?&quot;

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Tennyo agreed as she and Mutsumi walked
over to the front counter.

&quot;Shinobu,&quot; Kitsune called, &quot;lunch special number one!&quot;

&quot;Yes, Kitsune,&quot; Shinobu called from the kitchen. A few
moments later the younger black haired girl hurried up
with the plate, &quot;Hello, Tennyo-san.&quot;

&quot;Hi Shinobu,&quot; Tennyo smiled.

Reluctantly Mutsumi moved away as she said, &quot;I&#39;d
better get back to work.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Tennyo said as Mutsumi moved off,
receiving a bright smile in return.

Kitsune took off her apron as she said, &quot;I&#39;m on break,
okay?&quot; Receiving a affirmative from her coworkers she
sat on the seat by Tennyo&#39;s, &quot;You mind?&quot;

&quot;Be my guest,&quot; Tennyo smiled.

Getting a cup of sake from Shinobu Kitsune sipped
politely, her expression thoughtful. &quot;You&#39;ve made
quite a hit with our Mutsumi.&quot; she noted.

&quot;She&#39;s very sweet,&quot; Tennyo agreed.

Kitsune smiled wryly, &quot;But I have to say, Mutsumi
isn&#39;t too worldly. I&#39;d really hate to see her get
hurt.&quot;

Tennyo fought back a smile. &quot;I have no intention of
leading her on,&quot; she promised. A moment&#39;s hesitation,
&quot;I&#39;ve never...&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Kitsune nodded. She swirled her sake in the
glass, &quot;Mutsumi was very close to one of our former
roommates, and while she was happy for her friend&#39;s
marriage, it also left her pretty lonely. Just be
careful, all right?&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Tennyo promised.

Meanwhile, up at the Inn itself there was a smaller
meeting taking place in a room crowded by electronics.
&quot;You mean you found her?&quot; Anthy blinked, the dusky
skinned woman sitting down on the bed with a thump.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Su corrected cheerfully as the blonde
haired girl sat beside her partner in crime and
computer hacker.

Ema nodded gravely, her long brown hair flowing down
her back. &quot;I did some poking around,&quot; she said, &quot;and
tracked down several bank accounts for a &#39;Tenjou
Utena.&#39; Someone using those accounts has purchased a
plane ticket from Great Britain to Japan, and she&#39;ll
be arriving tonight.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect you two to be this quick.&quot; Anthy
noted weakly, her violet colored hair flowing around
her face.

&quot;You want the bad news?&quot; Su said.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Anthy looked at her curiously.

&quot;She&#39;s got a room booked in Tokyo, a Shinjuku hotel,&quot;
Su passed the print out over, &quot;can you get out there
in time?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Anthy said, a dangerous glitter in her eyes.

&quot;Otherwise, I can lend you the Tama-robo,&quot; Su added.

Ema paled, &quot;Not that. Kitsune gets very upset when you
do that.&quot;

Anthy smiled slightly at the girls&#39; antics as she got
up. &quot;I&#39;d better get going,&quot; she said, &quot;I need to back
a bag if I&#39;m going to Tokyo.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Su nodded.

&quot;Tell us how it goes,&quot; Ema added as Anthy left the
room and headed back to her own.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Su grabbed Ema by the hand after giving
Anthy a moment to walk off, &quot;let&#39;s go tell the
others.&quot;

&quot;But why...?&quot; Ema managed as Su dragged her off.

&quot;So we can follow her.&quot;

&quot;No way,&quot; Motoko Aoyama said seriously a short time
later, the tall black haired women crossing her arms
over her chest.

&quot;But Motoko...&quot; Su started.

&quot;It&#39;s tempting,&quot; Rei Hino admitted, still dressed in
her miko garb from her part time job at the shrine,
&quot;if only to figure out why she&#39;s so mysterious.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a bit surprised at you,&quot; Kanako admitted, the
whole group having gathered in the manager&#39;s quarters.
Privately she was even more surprised to be included,
though she supposed most of the inn&#39;s residents had
gotten over their grudges.

&quot;There&#39;s a unusual vibe I get from Anthy,&quot; Rei
admitted, &quot;not a sinister feeling, but...&quot;

&quot;Ah hem,&quot; Ami cleared her throat and Rei decided to
stop there.

&quot;Well, a little trip into Tokyo could be fun,&quot; Kitsune
tossed it, her boyish haircut giving her a impish
look.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be rude to intrude on Anthy-san&#39;s
reunion?&quot; Shinobu offered.

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Kanako agreed.

&quot;Awww,&quot; Su pouted.

&quot;I hate to agree with the Evil One,&quot; Motoko gave
Kanako a frown, &quot;but she&#39;s right. We shouldn&#39;t
intrude.&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Ema added quietly, &quot;I&#39;m sure we can get
most of the details out of her once she comes back.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Tennyo smiled slightly, &quot;good point.&quot;
