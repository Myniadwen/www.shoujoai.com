(Sasami)
The transportation system of Juraian ships - and generally most ships 
in this part of the galaxy - was, like many other things, based on 
subspace. Jurai had by far not been the first to master subspace but 
because of the Ouke no Ki, they had been by far the most successful 
and innovative. And yet, no one would probably ever, truly understand 
the entire volume of subspace. I, thanks to Tsunami, did a little 
better than most but we did not know everything. So saying that 
someone mastered subspace was a bit... excessive thinking.
Nevertheless, for most of the daily routines, constantly dealing with 
the use of subspace had become second nature to most space traveling 
races. We did not truly think about how it really works, or just how 
complex the processes involved are. Most of us grew up with it. Like 
the people on Earth used things like telephones or fax machines, only 
a selected few REALLY understanding what was behind it. Subspace 
manipulation was - to us Juraians at least who we were bonded to an 
Ouke no Ki - like riding a bicycle. We learned it once and never 
forget it.
And so, the brief disposition as space warped around us did not even 
fully register in my mind. I was too wrapped up in the kiss, currently 
shared with the older, raven-haired miko, and the harmony that had 
settled around us when this final barrier had been torn down. Crisis 
situations had a tendency to break through subconscious defenses all 
that much faster and made you aware of just how much you could lose by 
making up excuses for what your heart already knew. I needed Rei, 
desperately, more than I ever needed anyone other than Tsunami - but 
that was a whole different plane of need.
I had known for awhile now what I was feeling for the older miko but 
my past experience with Tenchi had made me... careful. That is what I 
had called it. This had been different, a part of me knew that right 
from the start, but that part had been outweighed by the hesitation of 
the rest. I had not wanted to be hurt again, ESPECIALLY because this 
was different. And so the point that we were at right now had come 
much later than it might have needed to be. Trust didn&#39;t come easy for 
us both, thus making us dance around instead of with each other far 
longer than needed.
That was okay. Maybe... No, not maybe. We both needed the time. Not 
just Rei, but I as well. To be certain. And I was now. I was certain 
and not afraid anymore of rejection. The strings that tied us together 
were too strong and too unyielding to let us stray far from each other 
now that we had been caught in them.
It took several moments for me to realize that Rei wasn&#39;t kissing me 
anymore and I was pretty sure I had to look rather stupid, eyes 
closed, lips still ready to continue the sweet contact. I would have 
been embarrassed had I not been so absolutely content. And the adoring 
smile gracing the other girl&#39;s lips was enough to warm my already 
overheated heart even more. Rei&#39;s hand lingered on my cheek, purple 
eyes focusing on mine and chaining me to their gaze. Not that I wanted 
to look anywhere else. &quot;I love you,&quot; the miko stated simply.
I leaned my head forward, nestling against her chest, content to be in 
the taller girl&#39;s arms for the moment. I felt secure. That place, that 
I had been searching for when I left Jurai, that I had wondered if it 
existed for me, it was right here, with Hino Rei. I knew that now. &quot;I 
love you, too,&quot; I replied softly. I didn&#39;t want to leave this place, 
never again. The comfort by the older girl&#39;s mere presence was 
calming, shooing away the shadows that had encircled me most of my 
life. There was no doubt that I could stay like this forever...
But there were other things to take care of.
Rei shifted slightly and I could feel her tender gaze on me leaving, 
its attention diverted albeit hesitantly. I glanced up and caught her 
taking in the scenery. Wonder reflected in those purple eyes, turned 
quickly to an overwhelming amazement and astonishment as, no doubt, 
her other senses added to the picture. It was impressive, I knew from 
experience. I still remembered the first time I met Tsunami and the 
first time I saw what a Ouke no Ki could do to subspace. The potency 
of manipulation was unchallenged by all but maybe a few life forms 
commonly known in the galaxy. And the stronger - and older - the tree, 
the stronger this potency.
&quot;What is this place?&quot; Rei asked breathlessly. For someone as sensitive 
as Rei was, the feedback all her senses were receiving had to be 
enormous. In fact, I realized that something had changed in my 
perception of Tsunami&#39;s subspace pocket as well. I wasn&#39;t entirely 
sure why that was exactly. I felt closer to Tsunami now than I had 
before. Not so much because of our impending assimilation but for a 
variety of different reasons.
The main one of course being the experiences from the battle this 
morning. There was a new understanding of the basic connection and 
dependency between Tsunami and I. For the first time I had really, 
fully realized that there was something that I contributed to this 
relationship. I had known this before, had been brought away from that 
scared perspective of thinking that I was simply assimilated into 
Tsunami, just a tool, a creation of hers. Many still thought so - one 
of the greater aspects why I decided to leave after all - and yet a 
bit of that had always been on the back of my mind. Nagging 
mercilessly.
It was ironic that it had taken Tokimi&#39;s attempt of removing me from 
the equitation before I began to comprehend my own potential for our 
bonding. Not that I wanted to say Tokimi had been responsible for 
that. Her interference just gave me the final nudge to draw the 
necessary conclusions. The process had begun much earlier and a lot of 
it I owed Rei. Through her and with her I felt more important than 
ever and she had made me more self-confident.
These short few months I had spent here on Earth had done wonders to 
me, as well as my relationship with Tsunami. When we left Jurai and 
also before that time, this place was like a sanctuary. Tranquil, 
calming... but lonely. Now, now the sounds and other impressions of 
nature all around me were more... vivid. More meaningful. Now it felt 
more like home whenever before. And I wondered how much of that was my 
own change in perception and how much Tsunami&#39;s own doing.
Anyway, the answer to that could be pondered at another point. Rei&#39;s 
attention was already diverted to a point where recreating any 
romantic atmosphere was mere wishful thinking. If this went as I 
hoped, however, the end result would certainly serve to strengthen our 
formed bond even more. I could only hope so... no, not just hope, 
steadfastly believe. Because if my belief proved to be false, all that 
I thought to know about Rei would collapse in on itself.
&quot;That is somewhat difficult to answer,&quot; I spoke eventually with a 
gentle smile, sensing the miko&#39;s growing expectation. &quot;Maybe we should 
start with the more important question surely on your mind.&quot; Which to 
guess was not entirely difficult at all, seeing as all her 
finely-honed senses would be drawn to this one, overwhelming object.
Rei did not answer right away, her gaze stayed fixed forward, focused 
on the majestic tree in the center of the subspace projection and one 
of the few things actually &#39;real&#39;... though that a very limited term 
to begin with.
I wasn&#39;t all that surprised at the eventual precision and underlying 
wonder in the words of the older girl. &quot;Is this... the World Tree?&quot;
I smiled sympathetically at the to be expected misunderstanding for 
one who did not know the entire picture... Heck, I barely grasped more 
than a part of it. &quot;Actually, this is ONE World Tree, as you put it. 
Other terms could be Life or often Mana Tree, although World Tree 
describes its best for what it is. The technical as well as 
mythological-rooted term is...&quot;
&quot;Yggdrasil,&quot; Rei finished with a sharp exhalation of breath.
I closed my eyes somberly. &quot;Hai. Don&#39;t get it confused though with the 
Norse mythology. They have the basic idea right but the actual concept 
is much more complex than either of us - including myself - is able to 
grasp.&quot;
&quot;So... We are in the center of the world?&quot; Rei asked in a disbelieving 
tone which I found once more totally understandable.
&quot;No. We are actually in Earth&#39;s orbit, inside a subspace field 
generated by this tree.&quot; As expected confusion showed on the miko&#39;s 
face and I could see the counter argument already forming in her mind. 
To avoid needless further confusion I was quick to continue and give 
the answer before the question. &quot;I never said this is Earth&#39;s 
Yggdrasil. This is Tsunami, the Yggdrasil of a distant yet rather 
important planet in this galaxy called Jurai, which - to a certain 
degree - is also my home.&quot; I looked up feeling curious and still 
wondrous purple eyes having torn away from the enchanting sight. &quot;I 
know, it&#39;s all a bit much but... I&#39;ll try and make you understand 
better, if you let me.&quot; My voice dropped a bit and I couldn&#39;t help the 
note of uncertainty that lurked at the edges of my conscious awareness 
even if it had been temporally pushed aside by the contend nature of 
this new relationship.
&quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I?&quot; Rei asked and once again I knew immediately why I 
felt so secure around the other girl. That intimate understanding that 
did not need graspable knowledge of the other but that was there 
beyond and above that simple material thinking. Not the topic of 
understanding was the deciding factor but understanding itself.
Without a further word, because there were none needed, my hand 
grasped hers and I pulled her along as I walked forward. Long had I 
thought about this after it became evident to me that this point could 
come soon. I did not wish to repeat the same mistake, the same 
misunderstanding produced when I tried to explain Tsunami and my 
relationship towards each other. I did not wish to do the same with 
Rei who was so willing to understand. And not just to try and 
understand a little...
After long thinking I had come to a rather simple solution actually 
but one which should suffice, especially for one such as Rei who had 
much more spiritual comprehension than others.
We stopped at the base of the tree and just stood there for a moment, 
hesitant. I had let go of her hand after a long time the miko 
tentatively reached out, the wish to establish some sort of contact 
with this magnificent life form tangible but also the awe and 
hesitation that came with it.
&quot;Go ahead,&quot; I encouraged softly, making Rei almost jump, so lost in 
Tsunami&#39;s presence had she already been. The raven-haired miko looked 
sideways, searching for confirmation and finding it. &quot;We want you to 
see, to know.&quot; I spoke these words with certainty and not just my own 
mind and voice. Tsunami herself had long come to approve of the other 
girl as a - if not THE - potential mate. And her opinion, or so I 
perceived now, seemed to have only grown with the events just a couple 
of hours ago.
Rei focused forward again but she closed her eyes in anticipation as 
her arm outstretched and her palm came to rest against the surface of 
the tree. Unlike other Ouke no Ki there was no key needed for Tsunami 
and I anymore. We were above such a simple tool necessary for 
communication since the bond that slowly brought us closer to 
assimilation was our own, personal key.
And so it was easy for me to mingle my awareness with that of my other 
half and, in a way, to share the same experience.

******************************

(Rei)
In my time as miko at a Shinto shrine I had touched many minds, minds 
with an awareness ranging from tiny to large. I had touched even 
more... things... in my time as a Senshi, much vaster and often darker 
than any formal training could ever prepare for. However, nothing 
compared nor prepared me for that moment that I touched the bark and 
through it the HUGE awareness of the majestic tree. The sensual 
overload was dizzying as I was pulled right into what one could hardly 
describe as the mind of tree. No mind was supposed to that complex, 
that vast, nearly unlimited in its reaches. From the little that I 
could grasp it seemed like the consciousness of the tree seemed to 
expand far above this system even, throughout the galaxy and into its 
furthest regions... and all that from its position in the orbit of 
Earth...
Those were only rudimentary impressions though. The process was too 
rushed to pick up more the one or other detail. I believed that I 
could have spent years studying this mind and would never tire of it. 
I felt not only the vastness but the beauty of this mind, the peaceful 
sense of security it emitted. Old, wise and comforting. For a moment I 
lost myself in the sensations, just feeling, just experiencing what my 
senses picked up on their own. Forgotten were the endless-seeming 
questions that had plagued my mind moments ago. The hows, whys, whats 
and so forth.
Then my spirit jolted back to reality - well, what you could call 
reality - and I noticed that what had at first been just a swirling 
vortex of colors to fast to be followed, had now stabilized into a 
semi-solid form. From other experiences I guessed that this was a 
mental image of the tree&#39;s consciousness, most likely a memory. Others 
might have been disorientated and quite spooked at finding themselves 
floating, I wasn&#39;t paying it much mind, instead focusing on the 
scenery.
A vast, barren plane lay before my eyes, stretching wide onto the 
horizon, here and there scant rock formations and the one or other 
cliff, they were to irregular to be classified as mountains. It was a 
lifeless planet. No forms of nature, no forms of light. Except for one 
- in this desolate terrain shining like a bright beacon of light. The 
very tree in which&#39;s mind I was now. Younger, but still the same. I 
could tell at once. There was no comparable life form to be found 
anywhere. There was no doubt about it.
&quot;When the Cauldron gave birth to the stars, the life as we know it 
now, we were also born.&quot; I looked to the side at the melodic, unknown 
and yet strangely familiar voice. What I saw was a figure in a long 
dress of regal design and beauty. At first glance I thought that it 
was Sasami but than I noticed that this woman was older, her blue hair 
unbound and she was radiating the same sense of security that the tree 
itself did.
My attention was drawn back to the scene as the landscape began to 
change. Soft light was flowing out from the tree and over the land, 
making it fertile wherever it went. &quot;We, who are known as the 
Yggdrasil, providing the mana, the source of life that life needs to 
exist and to grow. A planet with no mana cannot bear natural life. Of 
course we were far more than just the provider of the mana for a 
planet but most of that is not important right now. For a long time 
this was the reality. Life grew and evolved under our protective 
shields.&quot;
The scene changed, now showing a star system full of planets, all of 
them emitting a glow of some kind. I could feel the life force from 
every single one. &quot;To every star, every planet, their own tree. That 
was the law and the necessity.&quot; Suddenly several of the planets 
darkened. The glow so clearly visible before, drained away and the 
life force extinguished like a flame, their presence suddenly cold and 
simply dead.
&quot;And then there was She.&quot; The scene switched back briefly to the tree 
from the beginning, now standing on fertile ground, surrounded by a 
picture book scenery of nature. Then the image wavered and eventually 
expanded, now showing two more trees like the first one. They seemed 
almost identical and other than the distinct differences in their 
spiritual structure I couldn&#39;t tell much of a difference. Then again, 
I have never been good with plants. Makoto would have had an easier 
time pointing out differences in appearance.
&gt;From the greater interest were the three, female forms at the base of 
each tree. The middle one was the same as the one still floating at my 
side, albeit a tad bit younger seeming. That was hard to tell though 
since their features appeared to be timeless. The figure in front of 
the left tree was shorter than the other two, with spiky red hair, 
while the other one had short gray hair. A golden jewel could be seen 
on her for head and four strands of red in two pairs extended from it. 
What really pulled me in about her were the emotionless-seeming eyes. 
Cold and calculating. I had seen too many of them in this and my past 
life. They were hungry for power, for control.
&quot;We were the Three. The Three who were and still are supposed to watch 
over the other Yggdrasil. Our powers were great, our influence larger 
and far beyond the boundaries of our given stars. We were the judging, 
the enforcing and the executing aspect of the Law of Life.&quot; I glanced 
to the side at hearing the soft, mournful sigh. &quot;I do not know why or 
how she changed. Neither my sister Washu,&quot; she indicated at the 
redhead, &quot;or I understood her motives. For us spirits, who we are 
above the simplistic categorization of Good and Evil, greed, the 
thirst for power, all this was unknown to us. However, Tokimi,&quot; she 
indicated at the other woman who stood cold and aloof. &quot;She had never 
been satisfied with her role. With the passiveness. Only watching and 
protecting was not enough for her. She saw Evil spread in the world 
and believed that - since we had the power - we should do something 
about it. A noble sentiment, of course, but that had never been our 
purpose. We were part of the natural order and not above it. And so we 
refused to take any action, secure in the knowledge that doing so 
would only fuel what we would hope to extinguish.&quot;
Silence reigned for a few moments and nothing changed. The narrating 
spirit&#39;s face appeared deeply troubled by the stirred up memories. 
&quot;She didn&#39;t take it well,&quot; I stated, not needing the confirmation. The 
spirit nodded wordlessly.
&quot;Indeed not.&quot; Once again the image changed, now showing countless 
planets, their glow of life being sucked away. &quot;Against our warnings 
Tokimi started to use her power to bend the other Yggdrasil spread out 
through the galaxy to her will. Many of our kind were erased from 
existence when they resisted and Tokimi took control over their trees. 
Some she allowed to further flourish, albeit through her own means and 
imprint, others were sucked dry and their mana added to hers.&quot; The 
spirit bowed her head and one could feel the shame she felt at what 
had happened.
&quot;Is this why so few planets are inhabitable throughout the galaxy?&quot; I 
asked quietly, trying to grasp all the information I had received so 
far. Of course, I had heard about the World Tree and suspected that if 
something like that really existed on Earth, there had to be others on 
other planets. The Moon, to my knowledge never had one... And with 
this new information it made some sense. After all the atmosphere and 
the rest of the beauty of the Moon Kingdom had been created and 
sustained by the Ginzuishou.
&quot;Yes. Many have fallen to Tokimi&#39;s greed and only the strongest have 
survived and remain steadfast against her grasp... for now.&quot; The 
spirit lifted her head and once more the scene shifted. &quot;Tokimi grew 
in power and as you might expect already, we were soon not safe 
anymore from her. As she gathered more and more mana, expanding her 
influence, even the combined power of Washu and myself was struggling 
to stand up against her. We have tried of course to bring our sister 
back from the path of madness she had chosen to follow. It was 
fruitless, however, and she became more and more aggressive over 
time... until she managed to even get to us...&quot;
Now I saw the gentle blue-haired spirit - what had Sasami called her, 
Tsunami? - locked in combat with her darker sister, barely holding 
Tokimi off with a glowing energy shield that slowly crumpled until it 
lost all its power. At the verge of collapse the now defenseless 
spirit managed to release a huge burst of energy that made the other 
one recoil and shortly afterwards vanish with an angry snarl on her 
face.
&quot;With a last effort I managed to repel Tokimi, but that effort almost 
cost me my existence. It would have if not for...&quot; The image switched 
back to the outside and showed the tree on the planet again. Even to 
the untrained eye it did not look as healthy and impressive as before. 
Branches were hanging limp, some leafs were already turning a sickly 
dark shade of color. The ground around it was similarly effected. Once 
rich, green land was withering away, back to the lifeless state from 
which it originated. It made me sick just to look at. Seeing such a 
miraculous being dying was hard to endure.
That was when something unexpected happened. Just like before I 
thought it was Sasami that I saw but something told me that wasn&#39;t the 
case... even though I was hard-pressed to detect any difference. Not 
just physically but also spiritually they seemed to be identical 
twins. I shook my head, forcing myself to concentrate once more on 
what was happening. The Sasami look-alike had approached the dying 
tree, kneeling before it. &quot;Yes, if not for her. Curiously, she bore 
the same name as I. I believe that our meeting has been fated for a 
long time. A long war had just ended on her home planet, Earth.&quot; I 
started at that, looking at the spirit passively floating next to me 
and telling her story. Tsunami smiled. &quot;That has been a long time ago, 
around twenty millennia actually. What is important here is that it 
was because of her that I have survived this day. You may call it 
selfish, I - possessing now both of our individual perspective - shall 
call it fate&#39;s calling. Our essences mingled with each other, our 
individual star energy being nearly identical.&quot; The girl had one hand 
on the bark of the tree, her head bowed in deep concentration and eyes 
closed. A flare of energy emitted from her forehead briefly, too brief 
to get a better look. It almost looked like...
Suddenly the girl&#39;s body literally evaporated into burst of energy, 
her essence reduced to her spirit alone. The energy moved forward and 
was then absorbed into the tree. &quot;And so not only was I saved this day 
but through the assimilation of our individual spirits, something new 
was created. Something far greater than any of us could have ever 
imagined at this time.

******************************

(Tsunami)
It was strange speaking about myself in third person. To me the 
Tsunami of then and my present self there was no difference. But this 
way I believed it was easier to understand for the young Senshi. I did 
not wish to go into too much detail at this point. Especially about 
the war. Sasami and I had debated long about whether to reveal the 
information from Martel and all that was connected to it but with my 
vague perception of the future I had the impression that doing so 
would not be profitable in the long run.
&quot;Assimilation?&quot; Rei questioned and I smiled a little thankfully for 
the question. After all that was the root of the problem, the one 
thing many seemed to have trouble to understand. To tell the truth, I 
- that was the part of me that had once been that other girl - had not 
known what exactly I was getting into either. However, there had been 
the overwhelming feeling of belonging. That meeting twenty millennia 
ago was by far not coincidental.
&quot;Hai. Assimilation. The process of two individual souls becoming one. 
There are several different types of assimilation. Mainly those where 
one parts gets absorbed into another, or where a true balance is 
achieved, a preservation of both souls. Nothing lost, but everything 
gained.&quot; That was rather crude, of course, the actual process was far 
more complex and to say that nothing was lost and everything was 
gained was... a matter of perception. &quot;The individuals involved do not 
lose their self in the latter case. Rather they gain all that 
constitutes the other being and vice versa.&quot;
Of course, such a process did not leave you totally unchanged 
regardless of how compatible you were. Each life was different and 
merging two together you were able to retain the individual memories 
on one hand but compromises would have to be reached in your 
personality. The elemental spirit I had once been had not known much 
of mortal dealings and likewise the human had not known much about the 
spirit world. Not to mention that the soul of an Elemental and a human 
worked rather differently. Two vastly different worlds had collided 
that day and it had changed us... But not in a way where I ever felt 
that I totally lost anything of my aspects. It would be the same with 
Sasami... I just hoped Rei would understand it. Understand it better 
than Tenchi and the others had.
Seeing as the raven-haired miko was deep in thought but not further 
questioning, I decided to continue my retelling of what was 
practically my life. The memories were still so sharp and clear as if 
it had been yesterday. Dryads had another understanding of the time 
concept and even with a human&#39;s perception, millennia seemed to pass 
me by like years would to others. As helpful as it might be to have 
such vivid memories, they also made some of them even more painful.
Concentrating I called up another image from the depths of my 
recollection. One that still hurt to look at. I still remembered that 
day so clearly... Through my human part I had already known enough 
loss recently and so this one seemed even more needless than it was. 
&quot;While our sister was temporally set back, my near death had shaken 
Washu quite a bit.&quot; I closed my eyes, not needing and not wanting to 
see the images accompanying the words. &quot;It was too much for her.&quot; 
&#39;Foolish girl...&#39; &quot;She choose to give up her power and lock it away 
forever, so that Tokimi could never reach it up. She gave up her power 
and became human, with no recollection of her former life, with only 
three gems that stored her power as a last link to her past.&quot;
A gentle touch on my shoulder made me look up, however, I wasn&#39;t 
really surprised to see Sasami where. She had been there all the time, 
silent, unnoticed, listening. Pink eyes shone with understanding and 
compassion, and it was an eternally comforting sight.
&quot;A time of prosperity followed for planet Jurai,&quot; Sasami continued for 
me and I was grateful for the pause so that I could pull myself 
together. &quot;The assimilation of a Yggdrasil and a pure star seed had 
unexpected side effects. The first, as we on Jurai call them, Ouke no 
Ki was &#39;born&#39;. Not only did Tsunami receive a great expansion in her 
natural talents but she was the first and only Yggdrasil at that time 
that could produce offspring.&quot; I smiled faint but fondly at the images 
of my first children seeing the light of life.
&quot;At this time an Empire grew on Jurai that under the guidance of 
Tsunami and her children was soon to span most of our known galaxy. 
Tsunami and her children had also earned the ability to travel through 
space if properly outfitted. The incredible spiritual and subspace 
manipulation abilities that the Ouke no Ki possessed would prove to 
make them spaceships unlike any and challenged by very few others. 
Sentient ships that bond with their users, enabling the transfer of 
power between tree and partner in both directions.&quot;
&quot;Jurai soon began to expand to the stars,&quot; I continued. &quot;And a long 
time passed in which its territory expanded. It was a little more than 
700 years ago, in the reign of Emperor Azusa that a young girl was 
born who you should know very well.&quot; I smiled knowingly at Sasami and 
my other half blushed slightly. I called up the memories of Jurai 
about seven centuries ago, still vivid in both of our minds, albeit 
slightly blurred in that of my young charge. A young girl was walking 
through the Royal Palace while in the background sounds of Ryoko 
attacking could be heard. &quot;A couple of years later planet Jurai was 
attacked by a space pirate known as Ryoko. She was not truly evil... 
but that is a story for another time.&quot;
Young Sasami had now walked into the great chamber of the Ouke no Ki 
where all my children rested until a partner was found for them. &quot;To 
each of the Royal Family a tree, so it has been since the birth of the 
Juraian Empire. Sasami of House Masaki, Second Princess of Jurai had 
been of great interest to me since her birth. I had felt something 
special right away and so, for the first time ever, I took a partner 
like my children did. That day though...&quot;
I trailed off, feeling a wave of sadness wash over me, seeing the 
younger version of my other half fall down to the bottom of the 
chamber, flung of the platforms when an explosion rocked the chambers. 
There was also still the twinges of guilt. Guilt that I had not been 
able to save her that day, taking away the peaceful, normal childhood 
she should have deserved.
My voice seemed detached, even to me, as I watched Sasami&#39;s near 
lifeless form lying at the base of my tree self, her blood mingling 
with the Waters of Life and my own translucent form performing the 
only aid that I had been able to give at that moment. &quot;There was 
nothing left for me to do other than to merge with Sasami, bonding her 
life to me. I did not wish to rob her completely of her childhood 
though and so I initiated a slower process of assimilation that would 
take several years to finish.&quot;
If only it had been that simple. If only I could have predicted all 
that followed... Sometimes I wondered if it had been more merciful to 
finish the process just then and there. Nothing of her personality 
would have been lost after all... But I hadn&#39;t been able to bring 
myself to do that, a lurking fear remaining that maybe my more mature 
and greater soul would unintentionally swallow hers. I wanted to 
prepare her better for what was to come.
By doing that though, I had brought about much fear, sadness and 
misunderstanding...

******************************

(Sasami)
Being bonded like we were for such a long - well, for her it might 
have been relatively short - time, it was not hard to sense the 
feelings. I needn&#39;t even probe our link, too familiar the signs of 
guilt and misery. The gentle spirit of Jurai&#39;s patron ship never quite 
forgave herself for this incident and the years that followed, 
regardless of how foolish it was to blame herself.
I moved forward silently, taking her hand and looking up to meet the 
mirror image of my own self now not so far away in years anymore than 
it once had been. However, these eyes held something painfully old, 
countless millennia reflected in them. It always made me sad to look 
but at the same time all the more determined and assured that 
regardless of how this turn of events had come to be, it was the right 
thing. We had been made for each other, as corny as it sounded, I 
believed it to be true. Neither of us could explain, yet already now, 
drawing closer and understanding each other better, we realized that 
together we could... we WOULD be much happier.
Tsunami smiled softly, blinking away a ghostly tear... The space 
around us warped and at the next moment we were back on the physical 
plane, at the base of Tsunami&#39;s tree self. I glanced to the side and 
found Rei still unmoving, eyes closed and hand outstretched. Slowly 
purple eyes opened, a storm of conflicting emotions in them, awe, 
wonder, confusion, a thousand and one questions and for a horrible 
long moment I felt a numbing fear grip my heart that I had been wrong 
again. Despite all trust and certainty, that Rei wouldn&#39;t understand.
Then the miko slowly lowered her hand and she looked at me, her gaze 
somewhat impassive, not judging, just looking. After a few seconds - 
which felt more like an eternity - she took a step forward, her hand 
coming to rest on my cheek. The smile I was favored with lightened my 
heart but her next words nearly made me weep with joy. &quot;So,&quot; she asked 
seriously. &quot;If I get this right, in a few years when this assimilation 
is finished you are going to be what? A human dryad?&quot; Soft humor 
danced in her eyes and I couldn&#39;t decide whether to cry or laugh. And 
so I just leaned forward, melting into the embrace that came 
naturally.
I hadn&#39;t been wrong. She did understand. And it didn&#39;t matter to her. 
This had been my greatest fear... and Rei had brushed it aside with 
uncharacteristic humor. I really wanted to pound her for what but was 
simply too happy and relieved at the moment.
&quot;Is this what you have been so worried about all the time. That I 
would lose yourself in this assimilation thing.&quot; I moved my head 
slightly against her chest, attempting a nod but not really wanting to 
move, too contend in the safe haven I had found here. &quot;Silly girl,&quot; 
Rei chided, &quot;I love you. I know that now. And nothing is going to 
change that. You tell me that you&#39;ll still be the same?&quot; Again the 
barest nod. &quot;Then I believe you. I&#39;ve seen things in my life that were 
much weirder than this... well, not many, but maybe a few.&quot; She 
grinned but then turned serious again. &quot;And if you were to disappear 
one way or another, believe me, I&#39;d be there to pull you back right 
away. Because I have just found you, this incredible, mysterious 
creature who has been so persistent in opening and earning a place in 
my heart. Do you really think I&#39;d let you go that easily?&quot;
I didn&#39;t answer but snuggled a bit tighter into the older girl&#39;s 
embrace. Yes, I had found my place. The one I had set out to find upon 
leaving Jurai. I hadn&#39;t really looked, not even meant for it to 
happen... But it had happened and I wouldn&#39;t want to have it any other 
way.

******************************

(Rei)
&#39;So strong and yet so fragile,&#39; I thought with a mixture of fond- and 
sadness. How someone could go through all this emotional trauma and 
still smile at the simple joys of life, meeting each day with such 
enthusiasm as Sasami did, it was truly marvelous. I had thought I had 
had a tough childhood but somehow, comparing it to the other girl&#39;s 
tale it felt... insignificant. She had truly led an interesting life, 
that was for sure.
After a time of just holding each other, basking in the freshness and 
the soothing warmth of this new feeling, we had settled down against 
the base of Tsunami&#39;s tree self. I couldn&#39;t deny that I felt humbled 
to be allowed such a privilege but the tale I heard showed once again 
that sometimes even behind the great legends and myths a rather 
human-like story was to be found. Wonder, happiness, sadness, they 
were all close together, not even something as unique as a Yggdrasil 
was standing above it.
The atmosphere of this place, a subspace pocket as Sasami had called 
it, was contributing greatly to my efforts of soothing the other girl. 
It was hardly a wonder she was so worked up about this, being scarred 
once already.
Sasami had told me about her and her sister ending up on Earth, being 
in stasis for seven hundred years, chasing after their wayward 
half-brother - my head still kind of spun from all the family 
relations and I still couldn&#39;t quite wrap my mind around the concept 
that marriage between close family members on Jurai seemed to be 
normal...
She had told me that they had spent - despite some interruptions - a 
rather nice and happy year in Okayama, with the family their 
half-brother had founded and especially his grandson, a remarkable and 
talented boy called Tenchi. I kind of pitied the poor guy. From 
Sasami&#39;s description it sounded like he had been a totally unwanted 
girl-magnet. I doubted it was just my imagination that when Sasami was 
talking about this time, she seemed wistful, obviously very fond of 
the memory.
Things had begun to go wrong when the message of Sasami&#39;s vanished and 
assumed dead parents had reached them. They had to leave for Jurai, 
seeing as the succession of the throne was undecided and her brother 
Yosho had made his grandson his official heir, not wishing to rule 
himself. What had ensued was, as far as I understood it, a good bit of 
both political and emotional chaos.
&quot;Long peace, power and wealth have planted the seed of eventual 
destruction in the Holy Council... the seed that will eventually lead 
to most great dynasties falls,&quot; Tsunami had commented, her ghostly 
form appearing next to us. &quot;The secret about Sasami and I eventually 
came out and as predicted, fear began to spread through the royals. 
Fear for their position, fear for their personal esteem...&quot; I hadn&#39;t 
known that elemental spirits could be this emotional, but then again a 
part of her was already human, or at least human memories. Tsunami 
definitely seemed sad about this, as well as torn between anger and a 
bit of guilt.
The revelation about the special condition of their second princess 
wasn&#39;t the real problem. It was far more Tenchi&#39;s unwillingness to 
choose between any of the girls who were devoted at him, which 
included Sasami who had grown quite a bit more in the year since they 
met and was steadily continuing to do so - both her physical and 
emotional constitution. Seeing as Tenchi WAS the prime candidate for 
the throne and no one dared challenge him openly because of his 
incredible powers, the fear of the consequence should Sasami and with 
that Tsunami - their &#39;patron goddess&#39; as pretty much everyone believed 
the spirit was - became one of Tenchi&#39;s next wives making her Empress 
was tangible within the royals.
&quot;I had never wanted to rule,&quot; Tsunami had clarified, a hint of 
wistfulness. &quot;I thought I could do better when my sister, believing 
that watching, guarding and guiding would be enough. Of course, there 
is no perfect way to build and ensure an empires survival. I had been 
foolish to think that... But at this point it was already much too 
late. Maybe it would have been best to actually realize the fear that 
the Houses of Jurai had, although I believed and still do that it 
would have been far too late already. And I did not wish to betray my 
own principle. Even if the events had played out differently and 
Sasami had ended up at Tenchi&#39;s side... I would have not misused my 
power and standing to correct the flaws that I could see so clearly by 
force. I would have not been better than Tokimi...&quot;
However, Sasami never ended up with Tenchi. Why they had grown closer 
and the awkward age difference was slowly melting away, it never 
worked out.
&quot;Tenchi is just too much of a nice guy to say no to anyone, especially 
another girl,&quot; Sasami had put it and a somewhat melancholic grin 
underlining the sadness. He had obviously promised all contenders not 
to abandon anyone. Good sentiments, I suppose, but without her needing 
to tell me I could see where this was going. Love was not something 
you could just decide on, that I could say with conviction even with 
my own limited experience. Not that kind of love at least. The 
stressful year on Jurai that followed, in which a political struggle 
for both the succession line and the resulting marriage erupted, 
brought out &quot;many truths which I should have seen before&quot;, or so 
Sasami had put it. &quot;In the end, what decided for me was not that it 
became obvious that it had always been my sister and Ryoko who Tenchi 
had loved,&quot; the blue-haired girl confessed, &quot;That realization had hurt 
sure. Yet what was important was that he never really understood 
Tsunami and I. None of them did. They tried sure, and I don&#39;t even 
really blame them. However, beneath all the assurances given, all the 
kind and understanding words... I could see it sometimes in their 
eyes, Tenchi, Aeka-oneesama... That shadow of the doubt, that inkling 
fear I think they weren&#39;t even conscious aware of, that worry what 
would become of Tsunami and I when we joined.&quot;
And Sasami had been silent after that, no doubt lost in the memories. 
Tsunami had resumed the tale, telling of how they had decided to leave 
Jurai for good, a drastic measure that was supposed to rouse the 
Empire out of its stagnant state. With their Yggdrasil gone and only 
Tsunami&#39;s children left to support the planet, heavy cuts would be 
made into the organization of the royals&#39; daily life. Tsunami didn&#39;t 
say what drew them to Earth and seemed reluctant to do, so I could 
only speculate. Yet, in the end, it didn&#39;t really matter. Not right 
now anyway.
Yes, it was really no wonder that Sasami had been so secretive about 
this. A lot of the mysteries about the blue-haired princess were 
unraveling now, and yet there was still so much left to explore... and 
I looked forward to it. I really did. Listening to this bittersweet 
story, I had come to the resolution that I had to make sure Sasami 
would be as happy as possible from now on. She had already lost and 
given up so much, the least I could do for her was to try and make her 
happy. And I had to be honest about it... which I would. I wasn&#39;t like 
this Tenchi guy, nice words and half truths... When I had my mind set 
on something, I wouldn&#39;t dance around the subject. And now that I was 
certain about my feelings, I wouldn&#39;t... I couldn&#39;t let them go again.
&quot;I don&#39;t think I really loved Tenchi,&quot; Sasami pulled me out of my 
reflections of the past... what had it been? Minutes? Hours? I could 
honestly not tell. I looked down curiously at the head resting on my 
shoulder, reddish-pink eyes staring up at me with a peacefulness that 
once again reminded me of why the past couple of months since I had 
the mysterious girl for the first time and the emotional struggles in 
coming to terms with our mutual feelings were definitely worth it. 
&quot;Well, maybe I did love him,&quot; Sasami corrected, &quot;but I don&#39;t think I 
was ever in love with him. It has never been like this, what we have. 
I never felt so right about something before, not even with him.&quot; I 
couldn&#39;t help pick up the note of uncertainty, tiny, not much more 
than a whisper, and I realized that this wasn&#39;t entirely true. A part 
of her would always think back with fondness and a certain 
wistfulness, wondering how it could have been. That was alright 
though. I did not doubt the sincerity of her last words, the ones 
which were really important. This unique feeling of belonging, of 
absolute rightness, it was hard to misunderstand and I did feel it 
too.&quot;
Looking back I wanted to laugh at how silly I had been. Hurt by the 
death of my mother and the tense situation with my father, I had told 
myself that I wouldn&#39;t need love. That I was better of without it. Had 
I known then, had I really known what the world meant, I doubted I 
would have been so resolute in my decision. Sasami had shown me, the 
girl had slipped past my defenses unhindered and found her way right 
into my heart. Quite remarkable for someone of her age... Then again, 
saying that brought about a totally different question.
Sasami blinked, most likely seeing my momentary confusion. &quot;What is 
it, Rei-chan?&quot;
I laughed lightly, the sudden thought and attached question appearing 
a good bit out of context and probably much too late. I was 
nonetheless curious. &quot;Just a thought that popped in my mind. How old 
are you anyway? I would have said somewhere around fourteen or 
probably younger at first guess but now...&quot;
&quot;Depends on how you look at it,&quot; she grinned. &quot;Technically I should be 
eleven by now. Chronological, with stasis you have to add seven 
hundred more years. Physically, well, your guess was rather close 
there. I age about two years for each single one. So it should be 
around thirteen or fourteen. Spiritually, well...&quot;
I shook my head, laughing merrily. &quot;Don&#39;t bother. That would be like 
trying to estimate Pluto&#39;s age.&quot; For some reason there was a knowing 
quality to the answering smile but I shrugged it off to the fact that 
she - through Tsunami no doubt - already knew about the Senshi. Not 
that surprising if you just thought what the tree we were sitting 
under stood for. So, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the dryad and Pluto 
were on a first name basis...
The blue-haired girl sat a bit more upright, thoughtful for a moment. 
&quot;You know, I had been wondering about this. Why did you never ask 
before?&quot;
Exactly what I had been thinking and which made me laugh in the first 
place. Yet, the answer was as much simple as it was serious. &quot;Because 
it didn&#39;t matter.&quot;
Pink eyes glanced up shyly, full of wonder. &quot;Really?&quot;
I used my free hand - the other wrapped around her shoulders - to 
caress her face, drawing a tiny sigh from its owner. &quot;Really. Call it 
corny, but all that mattered to me in those last months was you. Not 
your age, or your physical appearance. Just you.&quot;
Sasami closed her eyes, a calm and happy smile forming that made me 
feel entranced by its radiance. &quot;I don&#39;t think it is corny. It&#39;s kind 
of beautiful,&quot; she admitted, eyes opening and staring right into mine. 
I was startled and at the same time humbled once again at the flood of 
emotion, unconcealed and overwhelming held within them. All directed 
towards me. It was mind-boggling on one hand and intoxicating on the 
other. I couldn&#39;t look away and I didn&#39;t want to either.
I leaned forward on impulse, lips meeting in gentle contact, each 
content to enjoy the harmony without feeling the need to go further 
and faster. This was a perfect feeling, one that I had - despite my 
resistance - searched for since my mother&#39;s death. And I had found it 
now.

THE END

Author&#39;s Note

Well, that was that. Sorry, it took awhile to get this first epilogue 
out. University life is taking a toll on my free time, and then there 
is new, exciting games to play too... Ah, oh well. Maia and I finally 
sat down the last days to wrap this up... Or more like actually write 
it (we had about a page or so before that...).
I hope I didn&#39;t trample on any hardcore Tenchi-fans feet with my 
explanations. Actually, I pretty much jumped over the actual canon 
events since for the purpose of this story they are rather low of 
interest. Remember when you read this that I did change a bit... or 
more liked added here and there... to suit the purpose of the 
Continuum. If someone doesn&#39;t like it, go find yourself a pure Tenchi 
fic, there are enough out there (and I have seen others whose grasp on 
the facts in the TM-verse are even more horrible and twisted... not 
that I think mine are horrible and twisted but some could think 
that... and I&#39;m rambling I better stop now.)
Not much too add. For all who hoped to get a good summary of the TM 
OVA, go look somewhere else (I actually have a few good links for 
those who need summaries). The position TM takes in the SL-verse is 
mostly tied to Sasami/Tsunami. Tenchi-tachi will have some measure of 
appearance later in the second main arc but their importance isn&#39;t 
ranking quite so high. What I tried here was to give you (and Rei of 
course) an understanding about Sasami and Tsunami&#39;s history as 
portrayed/hinted at in canon (OVA Novels (summaries)) and my own 
version of tying them in with the other elements, mainly the story 
about Yggdrasils, the first assimilation etc. That is my own product, 
so don&#39;t confuse it as canon.

With that out of the way, I hope I actually get on with the main story 
at some point... Or at the very least the interlude. *sighs* I&#39;ll do 
the other two epilogues eventually, maybe even the second if I have 
time these days but they are not so enormously important for the main 
arc. As you can probably guess the other two epilogues are about 
Kagome/Sango as well as Hitomi and Mizuki respectively, explaining 
their back story. Because that is what these epilogues are for. 
Wrapping things up and providing a bit of background information.

Have nice holidays everyone... assuming you&#39;ll get this before them. 
And don&#39;t forget to leave feedback.

Ja ne, yours
