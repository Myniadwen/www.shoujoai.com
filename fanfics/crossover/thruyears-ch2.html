<a href="../crossover/thruyears-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>GUNSHOP &#39;GUNSMITH CATS&#39;, THE NEXT DAY...
 
Rally Vincent slid the sign on the door to &#39;open&#39; and unlocked the door.  
It was a particularly sunny day, which made her feel good... despite 
owing a friend a lot of money.  Hopefully some criminal will feel 
desperate enough and try to jump bail or she would find someone on her 
&#39;hot list&#39;.  But for now she concentrated on the shop, her secondary 
source of income.
 
She looked around at the displays, which she cleaned before opening up, 
and was satisfied of the cleanliness, then went into the back room.
 
&quot;Minnie&quot; May Hopkins was there, going over the latest inventory and tax 
forms from the previous week... something they were careful of since an 
&#39;incident&#39; some time ago.  &quot;Let&#39;s face it, Rally,&quot; she began as her 
friend came in, &quot;we can&#39;t avoid paying Becky forever.  After all, she 
has helped us out on a lot of our cases.&quot;
 
&quot;I know, May, I know,&quot; the dusky-skinned gunsmith glumly said as she put 
on her work apron, &quot;but until we get that money from the bondsman, she&#39;s 
going to have to wait us out.&quot;   Changing the subject, Rally asked her 
young friend, &quot;By the way, have that shipment of new shotguns came in 
yet?  I can&#39;t wait to get a jump on hunting season.&quot;
 
&quot;About an hour ago,&quot; May answered.  &quot;After I&#39;m through with this, I&#39;ll 
enter the registration numbers of the guns into the database.&quot;
 
Rally smiled at May&#39;s answer.  &quot;Thanks.  It&#39;s a good thing I have you to 
get ahead on things, otherwise we&#39;d be in a lot of trouble, not to 
mention we&#39;ll never be able to pay Becky,&quot; she laughed.  Just then, the 
light at the door blinked, indicating a possible customer inside the 
shop.  &quot;Better hang on to that thought, May.  Looks like we got somebody 
in the shop.&quot;
 
Rally then left the back room... mindful to keep an eye on where she 
stashed the various backup guns she had hidden under the counters in 
case this customer was actually a front-man for a hold-up.  There was 
one individual inside, with long pale blonde hair and wearing a business 
suit.  The figure&#39;s back was turned to Rally, so she thought to let the 
possible customer know her presence.  &quot;Oh good morning,&quot; she began.  
&quot;What can I do for you today?&quot;
 
&quot;You can start by saying &#39;hello&#39;, Rally,&quot; came a British-sounding female 
voice, which caught Rally off-guard.  The figure turned around to reveal 
a somewhat plain, but beautiful woman in glasses.  &quot;It has been a long 
time.  You have grown-up well, old friend,&quot; she said, smiling.
 
It took Rally a few tense seconds to try to figure out this strange 
woman and why she knew her.  Then a look of recognition came over her 
features.  &quot;I-I-Integra?&quot; she stammered.  &quot;I-is that you?&quot;
 
&quot;Well nowadays I go by the name Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates 
Hellsing... but yes, it is me, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra answered, turning 
around fully.
 
Almost immedietly, Rally raced the distance between the two and gave her 
old friend a hug.  &quot;Oh wow!&quot; she exclaimed, laughing, &quot;I didn&#39;t think 
you would remember me!  Well... when Roy mentioned you when he told me 
about that incident with &quot;Bruiser&quot; Delany, I never thought it would be 
you!&quot;
 
&quot;Roy?&quot; Sir Integra quipped.  &quot;Ah... I believe you are referring to Lt. 
Coleman.  I did not think that you and the lieutenant would be friends.&quot;
 
&quot;Well... yeah Roy and I and his wife are old friends,&quot; Rally absently 
mentioned, scratching the back of her head.  &quot;Anyway, what brings you 
here to the States?&quot;
 
All of a sudden, Sir Integra&#39;s face looked as though it was a deer in 
the headlights.  Thinking quickly, she said, &quot;Well... I had business 
over here, so I arrived here yesterday.  You do remember that chemical 
spill at Joliet?  I was involved in that, but have to stay over a few 
days more.&quot;
 
&quot;Well... yeah, of course I do?&quot; Rally answered.  However, she studied 
Sir Integra&#39;s face and thought to herself, &#39;She&#39;s not telling me 
everything.  What is it she&#39;s holding back?&#39;
 
&quot;Rally?&quot; May&#39;s voice came from the back room&#39;s door, a mass of papers in 
her hands.  &quot;I need to find out more about...&quot;  She then up and saw the 
two women.  &quot;Rally, who&#39;s that?&quot; she asked.
 
&quot;Oh May,&quot; Rally blundered, &quot;how rude of me.  This is the person I told 
you about yesterday.&quot;  She indicated to Sir Integra.  &quot;May, this is Sir 
Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing... you know, my old friend.  
Integra,&quot; she added, pointing to May, &quot;this is May Hopkins.  She&#39;s also 
a friend of mine, and she helps me out here.&quot;
 
&quot;Wow!&quot; May exclaimed, racing to the two.  &quot;When Rally told us about 
you... well... I could hardly believe that she knew somebody like you!&quot;  
She then turned to Rally and whispered, &quot;And you said she wouldn&#39;t 
remember you when Becky made that suggestion!  Boy how wrong were you!&quot;
 
&quot;MAY!?!? WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE SO RUDE!?!?&quot; Rally exploded.
 
Sir Integra cleared her throat.  &quot;Excuse me, Rally,&quot; she said, &quot;but have 
I caught you in an awkward moment?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh... no you haven&#39;t, Integra,&quot; Rally sputtered, taking May aside, 
&quot;could you give a moment?&quot;  Moving to another part of the shop, she 
angrily whispered to her friend, &quot;Dammit, why the hell did you make that 
remark, May?  This is already as awkward as it is!&quot;
 
&quot;Uh... sorry, Rally,&quot; May answered.  
 
Her anger moving away, Rally took a big sigh and said, &quot;Well... I&#39;m 
sorry that I yelled at you like that.  It&#39;s just that... it was so 
clumsy, that&#39;s all.&quot;  Glancing over at Sir Integra, she added, &quot;Look... 
why don&#39;t you keep an eye on the shop?  I&#39;m going out to see if I can 
get reacquainted with Integra for a while.&quot;  May nodded, then Rally took 
off her apron and said to Sir Integra, &quot;I&#39;m going to get my coat and 
cellphone, Integra.  How about we go out for a bit?&quot;
 
&quot;Are you certain it is alright, Rally?&quot; Sir Integra asked.  &quot;You&#39;ve just 
opened up.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Rally said.  &quot;May&#39;s capable of running the shop herself.&quot;
 
Sir Integra just nodded as Rally disappeared into the backroom, then 
reappeared with her coat on.  As she was getting it on, however, Sir 
Integra noticed that Rally was wearing a shoulder holster... with an 
automatic pistol inside it.  Not noticing, Rally turned to her friend 
and called out, &quot;See you in a few hours, May.&quot;
 
&quot;See you later, Rally,&quot; May answered back, giving Rally a wave.
 
The two women - Rally and Sir Integra - exited the shop, where Walter C. 
Dolnez was patiently waiting outside near a Rolls-Royce.  &quot;Walter?&quot; 
Rally gasped, seeing him, &quot;You&#39;re still around?&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed I am,&quot; the old butler answered.  &quot;It is very nice to see you 
again, Miss Vincent.&quot;  He then turned to Sir Integra and asked, &quot;Where 
do you two wish to go, ma&#39;am?&quot;
 
Before the dark-skinned blonde could answer, Rally tapped her shoulder.  
&quot;Before you answer,&quot; she began, &quot;I want to show you something, Integra.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?&quot; Sir Integra said, her right eyebrow raising.  &quot;Pardon us for a 
second, will you Walter?&quot;
 
Walter nodded, afterwhich Rally led Sir Integra to the alleyway, where 
Rally&#39;s car - a blue1967 Ford Mustang Shelby Cobra GT-500 - was parked.  
&quot;What do you think?&quot; Rally asked, her blue eyes twinkling.  &quot;Done a lot 
of the custom work myself on it, but I&#39;m pretty proud of it.  Of course, 
I assume you have better cars than this back in England... possibly 
another Rolls or a Bentley... maybe even a Jaguar .&quot;
 
Sir Integra smiled, looking at the car.  &quot;Quite true, I have a few very 
good motorcars back home,&quot; she finally said.  &quot;However, they are nothing 
compared to this classic you have.&quot;  She then looked at Rally and asked, 
&quot;Rally, you would not mind it much if I rode along with you, do you?&quot;
 
Rally smiled.  &quot;Why of course,&quot; she answered.  &quot;But what about your 
car?&quot;
 
&quot;I will ask Walter to drive it back to the Embassy extension compound,&quot; 
Sir Integra offered.  &quot;You can drop me off there once we are through.&quot;  
She then asked, &quot;You do know where it is?&quot;
 
&quot;No,&quot; Rally said, shrugging, &quot;but I&#39;m certain you can give me 
directions.&quot;
 
&quot;Very well,&quot; Sir Integra said.
 
After giving Walter instructions, Sir Integra joined Rally inside her 
car.  After both of them buckled up, Rally started the engine... for 
which the throaty sound gave the rather dignified woman next to her a 
start.  &quot;Ready?&quot; Rally asked.
 
&quot;As ready as I am,&quot; Sir Integra confirmed, already wondering why she 
excepted her friend&#39;s offer.
 
&quot;Okay, let&#39;s go!&quot; Rally called out, putting the transmission into gear, 
releasing the clutch as she roared out of the alley.  At first, Sir 
Integra began franticly looking for a hand-hold, noticing how fast Rally 
got out of the alley, but then settled down as Rally quickly assumed a 
safe speed limit.
 
&quot;I sincerely hope Miss Vincent is a more cautious driver that she 
appears to be,&quot; Walter sighed, watching the two depart as he got into 
the Rolls-Royce.
 
+ + +
 
It was sometime later the two were inside a small, yet tasteful bistro, 
where both of them ordered lunch... with Rally paying.  Sir Integra had 
a simple roast beef sandwich on white and a cup of hot tea, while Rally 
ordered a ham-and-swiss half-sub with multi-grain chips and a diet cola.  
In-between bitefulls, the two indulged in mostly small-talk, but Rally 
had noticed that Sir Integra had avoided answering certain parts of her 
past, but didn&#39;t press the subject, figuring it was something that was 
secret.
 
The subject of their discussion soon moved to Rally&#39;s life.  &quot;So let me 
understand this,&quot; Sir Integra began, &quot;the gunshop is only a secondary 
occupation and you are a &#39;licensed recovery agent&#39; by trade?&quot;
 
&quot;Yup,&quot; Rally answered after swallowing a sip of her drink.  &quot;What I do 
is go after criminals that had skipped-out on their bail and bring them 
back to stand trial.  I then get paid a portion of the bond that was 
posted.  The job description is good, but it doesn&#39;t have the panic 
potential of &#39;bounty hunter&#39;, though.  It does have its share of danger, 
though... if that little problem I had with Natasha Radinov is any 
indication.&quot;
 
&quot;I would imagine, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra replied, recognizing the name of 
the infamous assassin.  She then looked at a sign posted on the wall, 
sighed and added, &quot;It is too bad that this establishment has a &#39;no 
smoking&#39; rule.  I could really use a smoke to relax a bit.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?&quot; Rally answered.  &quot;Well, I&#39;m a non-smoker myself, but I don&#39;t 
mind people lighting up a cigarette every once-in-a-while.  I only allow 
smoking in the backroom.&quot;
 
&quot;That is considerate of you, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra said, then added, &quot;But 
I would wonder if you would say the same thing for cigars.&quot;
 
Rally&#39;s eyes widened, catching on.  &quot;You... smoke cigars?  No offense, 
Integra, but I can&#39;t see you as the cigar-smoking person,&quot; she added, 
mildly surprised.
 
&quot;None taken,&quot; the blonde replied, chuckling.  She then got out of her 
chair and added, &quot;Well, I should be returning to the compound soon.  
I&#39;ve got a lot of work to do.&quot;  
 
&quot;No kidding,&quot; Rally said, also rising.  &quot;After I drop you off, I better 
go back to the shop and check on May.&quot;  The two then walked out of the 
bistro, Rally continuing to talk, &quot;She tends to get a little irritated 
when I&#39;m gone for a long time and...&quot;  However, before she could 
continue, she took a look across the street, an intense look on her 
face.
 
Sir Integra noticed Rally&#39;s mood.  &quot;Excuse me Rally, but is something 
wrong?&quot;  
 
Rally didn&#39;t answer, instead drawing her gun - a CZ-75 - and began to 
race across the street... with Sir Integra following close behind.
 
They didn&#39;t go far.  A skinny, rather scruffy-looking fellow was leaning 
against a building, not doing nothing in particular.  &quot;Hello, Alfie,&quot; 
Rally&#39;s voice came from behind him.  
 
Alfie flinched, then started to bolt away... but the sound of Rally 
cocking the hammer of  her gun made him freeze.  &quot;Smart move,&quot; Rally 
said, still aiming at Alfie from behind.  Too bad it wasn&#39;t smart 
enough, for he tried to throw a punch at her, but she ducked back, 
elbowed the back of his head and swept his legs.  
 
&quot;Okay, I stand corrected,&quot; Rally added sarcastically as she knelt 
against his back, &quot;You&#39;re NOT too smart.&quot;
 
&quot;What the fuck are you doing?&quot; Alfie barked back.  &quot;I didn&#39;t do 
anything!&quot;
 
&quot;Oh really, Alfie?&quot; Rally countered.  &quot;Let&#39;s see... breaking-and-entry, 
grand larceny, receiving stolen items... not to mention failure to 
appear in court for all those charges... doesn&#39;t sound like nothing to 
me.&quot;
 
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just fuck-off and die?&quot; Alfie growled.
 
Rally simply smiled and added, &quot;Sorry... but I don&#39;t do requests.&quot;
 
Sir Integra simply looked on, while Rally produced a pair of zip-cuffs 
and restrained the felon.  &quot;Interesting,&quot; she finally said, smiling.  
&quot;Even while relaxing, you still find time for work.&quot; 
 
&quot;Just dumb luck, I guess,&quot; Rally shrugged, &quot;Being at the right place at 
the right time, that&#39;s all.&quot;  She then hoisted Alfie up on his feet.  
But as he did, a bag fell out of his shirt pocked... and inside were 
several injection vials.
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; Rally mumbled as she quickly gathered up the bag.  But when she 
looked at the contents of the bag, her mood suddenly shifted... from 
extreme surprise to blind rage!  Slamming Alfie against the wall, she 
grabbed him roughly by his shirt collar and angrily yelled in his face, 
&quot;ALRIGHT, ASSHOLE!  I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE HELL YOU GOT THIS!!!&quot;, 
holding the bag in his face. 
 
&quot;Wha-what are you talking about?&quot; Alfie whimpered - and got the barrel 
of Rally&#39;s gun jammed tightly under his jaw after she dropped the bag.
 
&quot;DON&#39;T PLAY DUMB WITH ME, ALFIE!!&quot; Rally snarled, looking as if she 
wanted to pull the trigger.  &quot;I WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE HELL YOU GOT THIS 
AND I WANT IT NOW!!!&quot;
 
Suddenly fearing for his life, Alfie blurted out, &quot;LOOK MISS, I GOT THAT 
BAG FROM A STRANGE GUY THREE NIGHTS AGO!  HE TOLD ME TO HAND IT OUT TO 
SOME PEOPLE, THEN GET THEIR ADDRESSES!!  I SWEAR TO YOU, THAT&#39;S ALL!!!  
DON&#39;T SHOOT ME!!!&quot;
 
&quot;RALLY!&quot; Sir Integra yelled out, surprised by her friend&#39;s sudden change 
of  mood.  &quot;WHAT IN THE NAME OF GOD HAS GOTTEN INTO YOU??&quot;
 
Almost as quickly as she heard Sir Integra, Rally came to her senses.  
Withdrawing her gun from the crook but maintaining eye contact, she 
reached for her cellphone and hit the speed dial.  When she got the dial 
tone, she quickly switched to speaker, where everyone heard, &quot;Coleman 
here.&quot;
 
&quot;Roy, it&#39;s me Rally!&quot; she answered crisply.
 
Coleman&#39;s voice had a note of concern.  &quot;Rally... is something wrong?&quot;
 
&quot;I caught a bail-jumper near the Sunlight Bistro,&quot; Rally began, &quot;but 
what I found on him I didn&#39;t like!  Could you get over here and pick him 
up?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m on my way, Rally,&quot; Coleman answered then hung up.
 
During this conversation, Sir Integra happened to get a look at the bag 
Rally held.  &#39;Those vials,&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;They are the very 
same as the vial Alucard discovered last night.&#39;
 
+ + +
 
A few minutes later, several squad cars had showed up, where several 
policemen took Alfie into custody... and Coleman was giving Rally an 
impromptu lecture on the finer parts of street interrogations... 
whatever she wanted to listen or not.  &quot;I&#39;m serious, Rally!&quot; he scolded, 
glaring angrily at her, &quot;You can&#39;t go around getting information by 
threatening a suspect with a gun like that!  You&#39;re lucky someone was 
there to stop you, because I sure as hell don&#39;t like the idea of hauling 
your ass off to jail for murder!&quot;
 
&quot;I know, Roy.  I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rally moaned, &quot;But when I saw this on him... 
I sort of lost it.&quot;  She then handed him the bag.  &quot;Alfie was told to 
push Kerasine on a few unsuspecting people, but that guy doesn&#39;t know 
who.&quot;
 
&quot;Kerasine,&quot; Coleman muttered, recognizing the vials.  &quot;And when there 
Kerasine...&quot;
 
&quot;...Then it&#39;s a sure bet Goldie&#39;s not too far behind,&quot; Rally finished.  
&quot;It&#39;s a good thing Misty&#39;s no longer in town... otherwise there would be 
too many targets for that bitch to get to just to get me.&quot;
 
Coleman nodded, adding, &quot;I&#39;ll get an A.P.B. out on Goldie A.S.A.P..&quot;  He 
then leaned over to Rally and added in a stern voice, &quot;I don&#39;t have to 
tell you not to go gunning for Goldie herself.  She&#39;s too smart to leave 
herself out of the open.&quot;
 
&quot;I got it, Roy,&quot; Rally answered, &quot;but I&#39;ve got to get my friend here 
back to the British extension compound.&quot;
 
Coleman then noticed Sir Integra, who was standing nearby... and 
listening carefully to the conversation without their noticing.  &quot;Oh... 
Sir Hellsing, I was hoping I could talk to you.  I&#39;m sorry about that 
little problem with Captain Delany yesterday.&quot;
 
&quot;There is no need to apologize, Lt. Coleman,&quot; Sir Integra answered.  &quot;I 
am certain you have the problem at hand.  And now if you will excuse me, 
I would like Rally here to take me back.&quot;  Coleman did not object, and 
soon the two women took off in Rally&#39;s car.
 
THE BRITISH EMBASSY EXTENSION COMPOUND, AT SUNSET...
 
&quot;I have gotten the confirmation from Agent Lewis about the compound that 
Alucard reported,&quot; Walter said, holding several printouts in his hand.  
&quot;The substance presented was indeed the compound Kerasine.&quot;
 
Sir Integra simply sat at the desk, a cigar smoldering in her hand.  She 
noted that the sun had slipped over the horizon... which usually meant 
the appearance of the two vampires of the Royal Order of Protestant 
Knights Hellsing... Alucard and Seras Victoria.  &quot;So what are the 
particulars of this drug, Walter?&quot; she muttered, apparently in deep 
thought.
 
&quot;Sir Integra... I believe it would be best if the others arrived as well 
before we proceeded,&quot; Walter pointed out.  And as if to punctuate his 
observation, Alucard chose that moment to appear out of thin air, as he 
usually does.  
 
The No-Life King looked at his master... who clearly didn&#39;t seem to be 
in the mood for his usual mind-games.  &quot;Well,&quot; Alucard began, &quot;you seem 
in one of your moods again, Sir Integra.&quot;  He then smiled and added, &quot;I 
sincerely hope it wasn&#39;t something Walter had said.  I know he has a 
sense of humor, but it&#39;s no need to get medieval on him.&quot;  Walter just 
rolled his eyes, but said nothing.
 
&quot;Very funny, Alucard,&quot; Sir Integra grumbled.  Noticing one person was 
missing, she added, &quot;By the way... where in the world is your 
fledgling?&quot;
 
As if on-cue, Seras showed up.  However, she didn&#39;t open the door.  
Rather, she had phased through the door, albeit not too well.  &quot;Sorry 
about being late, Sir Integra,&quot; the Draculina began, finally 
materializing inside, &quot;but Master has been wanting me to practice more 
of my powers.&quot;  She then looked at Sir Integra, blushed and added, 
&quot;Please... don&#39;t be mad at me.&quot;
 
&quot;I am not, Captain Victoria,&quot; Sir Integra said, noticing Seras&#39; blush.  
She then began to wonder why a vampire would react like that, but 
decided not to ask.  &quot;Actually, you&#39;re doing very well.  Anyway... 
Walter, please continue with your report.&quot; 
 
Walter nodded, then began.  &quot;Like I told Sir Integra,&quot; he said, 
&quot;Kerasine... or &#39;Powerball&#39;  as it&#39;s known on the streets, is a powerful 
synthetic narcotic, cheaply manufactured and distributed in quantity, 
primarily in this area of the country.  The one characteristic of this 
drug is that, depending on the dosage, it can mimic the effects of 
several other illicit drugs; the smallest amount can simulate cocaine, 
while the largest can bring about the effects of lysergic acid 
diethylamide, commonly referred to as L.S.D..&quot;  He cleared his voice as 
he continued, &quot;However, regardless of the dosage, there is one 
particularly nasty side-effect... it renders the user susceptible to 
suggestion, much like hypnosis.&quot;
 
Alucard frowned hearing this.  &quot;So this is how they plan to work,&quot; he 
growled.
 
Seras looked confused.  &quot;What are you talking about, Master?&quot; she asked.
 
&quot;Think about it, Police Girl,&quot; Alucard growled.  &quot;If this drug were to 
get out in the open market, there could be thousands of willing subjects 
to the FREAK chip we discovered in Joliet.&quot;
 
&quot;I... see,&quot; Seras said, nodding. 
 
Sir Integra&#39;s brow furrowed.  &quot;This is monstrous,&quot; she said, &quot;using a 
drug to force others to renounce their humanity and become these 
FREAKs.&quot;  Looking up to Walter, she added, &quot;So what about this... Goldie 
that I heard Rally mention.&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; Seras mumbled.  &#39;Who is this... Rally?&#39; she thought to herself, 
feeling a stab of jealousy.  Alucard briefly glanced at her.
 
&quot;Let me show you all on the plasma monitor,&quot; Walter said, oblivious to 
Seras&#39; reaction.  He punched several commands on the laptop on Sir 
Integra&#39;s desk, which activated a plasma monitor on the wall.  A picture 
of a woman with strawberry-blonde hair show up, along with a D.E.A. 
file.  &quot;Goldie Muso, alias &quot;Iron Goldie&quot;, currently believed to be the 
head of the Muso crime family, which has it&#39;s origins in Sicily.  Her 
specialty is psychopharmacology, and has created a number of has been 
called &quot;designer drugs... which includes, sadly enough, Kerasine.  She 
is also an excellent hand-to-hand fighter and strategist.&quot;
 
&quot;So she is responsible,&quot; Sir Integra mused.  &quot;Still, that doesn&#39;t 
explain Rally&#39;s reaction to her.&quot;
 
&quot;I believe I have more, which could explain that,&quot; answered Walter, then 
produced on the monitor a side-by-side showing of Goldie&#39;s picture next 
to Rally&#39;s.  Seras let out a small growl, but nobody - except Alucard - 
noticed.  &quot;It seems that Goldie is also a lesbian that has a controlling 
personality, and has been known to surround herself with teenaged girls, 
all of them Kerasine-induced as assassins.  &quot;She and Miss Vincent had 
clashed from time-to-time... with Goldie proclaiming that one day, she 
will be able to break Miss Vincent&#39;s will and make her Goldie&#39;s personal 
slave... both in servitude and sexually.&quot;
 
&quot;That woman is a monster,&quot; Sir Integra growled.
 
&quot;There&#39;s more,&quot; Walter added.  &quot;It seems during their last meeting, 
Goldie was able to use Kerasine to enslave Miss Vincent&#39;s father as 
well... using him as her personal assassin.&quot;
 
Sir Integra finally decided she heard enough and motioned Walter to 
stop.  &quot;Personally, I would like to see this woman stopped, not only for 
the harm she&#39;s causing the general populace with this drug, but also 
what this drug might cause when the FREAK chip is used as well.  
Unfortunately, we are only guests in this country and do not have any 
jurisdiction to act.&quot;
 
&quot;Then I suggest we wait her out,&quot; Alucard added, smirking.  &quot;This Goldie 
is obviously get paid... and very well.  And greed is a very powerful 
emotion.&quot; 
 
Sir Integra nodded.  &quot;Very well.  It may be a long time before we see 
results... but it may be worth the wait.&quot;  She got up and passed Seras - 
afterwhich she blushed - and said, &quot;I will contact Agent Lewis and see 
if he could find out more about Miss Muso.  Dismissed.&quot; 
 
Seras departed first, her face unreadable.  She only went a few yards 
from the office when Alucard appeared in front of her.  &quot;You&#39;re a little 
quiet, Police Girl,&quot; he smirked.  &quot;Would you like to talk about it?&quot;
 
Seras had a confused look on her face.  &quot;Sorry... but talk about what, 
Master?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh... some odd stuff, nothing special,&quot; Alucard remarked, &quot;especially 
your reaction to seeing Sir Integra&#39;s friend.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, Master,&quot; replied Seras a bit 
too defensively.
 
&quot;Me and Walter saw how you reacted,&quot; the No-Life King countered, &quot;how 
your jealously showed itself.&quot;  His voice then softened, &quot;Both of us 
know of your infatuation with Sir Integra; it is very evident on the way 
she complimented you on your progress with your powers, not to mention 
when you disposed of that FREAK the other night.&quot;
 
The young vampire was silent for a few minutes.  &quot;I guess it does show,&quot; 
she finally said.  &quot;To tell you the truth, Master... I... I think I love 
Sir Integra.&quot;
 
&quot;Then why do you not tell her?  Surely she&#39;ll understand,&quot; Alucard 
offered.
 
&quot;It&#39;s just that...&quot; Seras struggled for the right words, &quot;I&#39;m not sure 
she&#39;ll except me.  She&#39;s very dedicated to the Anglican Church as it is, 
so I don&#39;t think her faith would allow it.  And even if she did,&quot; 
several bloody tears showed themselves on her face, &quot;I don&#39;t think 
she&#39;ll accept a vampire as a lover.  I&#39;m so afraid that she&#39;ll reject 
me.&quot;  She then hugged Alucard tightly, sobbing. 
 
Alucard felt a little uncomfortable, having to comfort his fledgling, 
but he swallowed his pride and replied, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry too much, 
Police Girl.  Give her time... who knows, you might be surprised by the 
results.  Now I suggest you get yourself cleaned up.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes... I&#39;ll do that, Master,&quot; Seras sniffled, then proceeded to the 
nearest bathroom to clean her soiled face.  Alucard simply sighed, 
wondering how he became a counselor.

&quot;Walter?&quot; Sir Integra asked, taking a break from her paperwork.  &quot;I 
wonder if I should have told Rally the truth.&quot;
 
The old butler looked over.  &quot;I do not believe I follow you, Sir 
Integra,&quot; he answered.
 
&quot;I am talking about if I should have told Rally what I really do... 
about the Hellsing Organization.  She was entirely truthful about her 
past and what she did, but when she asked me the same, I found myself 
being evasive.  God and Her Majesty knows I want to protect Rally from 
whatever danger she may encounter if she knew... but I wonder if it is 
the right way.&quot;
 
Walter bent over to Sir Integra and answered, &quot;It is not my place to be 
your advisor in such matters, Sir Integra... I simply do your bidding, 
that is all.  However, if you do choose to let Miss Vincent share in the 
truth, I will support you as always.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you, Walter,&quot; Sir Integra sighed.  &quot;Perhaps I shall... but 
gradually, to allow her time to absorb the gravity of the revelation... 
and I believe I know how to accomplish it.&quot;
 
THE RECTORY OF A LOCAL CATHOLIC CHURCH, THE NEXT DAY...
 
&quot;Thank you, Father,&quot; Captain Kevin Delany said to the priest as he left 
the office, &quot;I think I will do just that.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that, Kevin,&quot; the elderly priest said, shaking his 
hand.  &quot;To take up the department&#39;s suggestion of anger management 
counseling is the first step in finally moving on after your wife&#39;s 
death.&quot;
 
&quot;Glad to hear,&quot; Delany said.  &quot;Ever since Gladys died, I was constantly 
letting my anger get the best of me and yesterday was the topper.  If I 
followed through with attacking them... I have an idea that my career 
with the department, along with my pension, would be a thing of the 
past.&quot;  Changing the subject, he asked the priest, &quot;By the way, with 
that problem that came up with you... I&#39;ll have you in my prayers, 
Father.&quot;
 
The priest looked sadly as he answered, &quot;These days, Kevin... that&#39;s all 
I have left is prayer.  Well, I won&#39;t be keeping you.  I&#39;ll see you this 
Sunday.&quot;
 
&quot;You too, Father,&quot; Delany said.  The detective then left the rectory 
building and started to his car when he nearly ran into a young nun, who 
was carrying a sizeable load.  &quot;Oh excuse me, Sister,&quot; he blundered, &quot;I 
didn&#39;t notice you were coming.&quot;
 
The nun, who appeared to be Japanese in nationality, straightened her 
load, smiled and replied, &quot;Oh that&#39;s okay.  I should&#39;ve been more 
careful in carrying these donated items.&quot;  She then changed the subject, 
&quot;So... you&#39;ve been to see the priest?  I&#39;ve just got here and don&#39;t know 
many people here.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, this parish has a lot of good people,&quot; Delany began, &quot;and I&#39;m 
certain some good friends here, Sister... er... I haven&#39;t got your 
name.&quot;
 
&quot;Takagi,&quot; the nun replied, smiling.  &quot;Sister Yumiko Takagi.  And yes, 
I&#39;ll try to make friends while I&#39;m here.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay,&quot; Delany said, heading for his car while Yumiko carried her load 
in another direction.  &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;
 
Yumiko waved goodbye, then proceeded to the local thrift store with the 
donations.  As soon as she did, however, she had ducked into an alley.  
After going a short distance, she found a secluded area, where standing 
hidden in the shadows was another woman, blonde and dressed in the 
manner of a Catholic priest.  &quot;So,&quot; the woman said in a heavily-accented 
German voice, &quot;it is set for tonight.&quot;
 
&quot;I see, Heinkel,&quot; Yumiko replied, albeit in a sad voice.
 
&quot;Yumiko,&quot; the woman - Heinkel Wolfe - said, her tone sympathetic, &quot;I 
know you don&#39;t vant to do it... but it has to be done.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Yumiko sighed, taking off her glasses.
 
***
 
It was ten in the evening when the priest had left the rectory and 
headed home.  His mind was heavy with worry and shame that evening.  For 
over thirty years he had to fight his hidden urges... and losing.  
During this time, whenever talk came of an alter boy being abused in a 
church he served at, he would be quickly and quietly moved to a new 
parish... where no matter how he tried, no matter how much he prayed, he 
would find himself succumbing to his unholy urges.
 
So involved with his thoughts was the priest that he almost failed to 
notice the figure in front of him.  &quot;Guten Tag, Father,&quot; the figure, a 
female addressed him.
 
&quot;Er... Miss?&quot; the priest blundered.  &quot;Is there... something you want?&quot;
 
&quot;Ja... your life, Father,&quot; the figure, Heinkel Wolfe said, stepping out 
of the shadows.  &quot;Your life as payment for the crimes of your perverted 
past... and justice for all your victims!&quot;  Wolfe produced a gun, which 
she aimed at the priest.
 
Turning back in a panic, the priest fled in the opposite direction, back 
to the rectory... or anyplace with a phone.  He would&#39;ve gone farther... 
if his legs were not suddenly cut-off at the knees.  Falling face-first, 
the priest managed to pull himself upright to face his assailant, but 
was surprised to see Sister Yumiko, a katana in her hand.  Yumiko also 
didn&#39;t look the same.  She was smiling... but it was not the warm, kind 
smile he was fond of.  This smile had a cruel, sadistic smirk to it, and 
her eyes, which didn&#39;t have her glasses, were wide and wild.  &quot;S-Sister 
Yumiko?&quot; he whimpered, seeing her partner walking behind her.
 
&quot;Sorry Father,&quot; the nun smirked, drawing back her blade, &quot;Yumiko&#39;s taken 
a nap for now.  You can call me... Yumie!&quot;  
 
The priest didn&#39;t have time to scream, his head cleanly cleft from his 
body.  The job done, Yumie shook the blood from the blade before 
replacing it in the scabbard and turned to Heinkel.  &quot;Boy, that was a 
boring job,&quot; she grumbled.  &quot;I would&#39;ve liked to see him at least beg 
for his life before loping off that pervert&#39;s head.&quot;
 
Heinkel shook her head and sighed, &quot;Sometimes Yumie, I think you enjoy 
killing way too much!  No wonder Yumiko doesn&#39;t like to wake you up.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, yeah, whatever,&quot; Yumie replied, &quot;let&#39;s just hope Archbishop 
Maxwell&#39;s got a more interesting job ahead of us.&quot;
 
As if on cue, a cellphone rang, which Heinkel took out and answered.  
&quot;Ja?  Ja, Archbishop, the deed is done.  Ja?  Ja?  Ja?&quot;  A pause.  &quot;I 
see.  Vell, ve vill be vaiting at the airport for his arrival.  Danke.&quot;  
She then switched off the phone, turned to Yumie and said, &quot;Vell, it 
seems that your vish has been granted, Yumie.  A patron for the 
archbishop&#39;s has told him of an individual that may have gotten too 
close to someone that Iscariot doesn&#39;t like.&quot;
 
&quot;And we&#39;re going to kill this individual?&quot; Yumie asked, somewhat 
eagerly.
 
&quot;Not so fast,&quot; Heinkel countered, which disappointed her partner.  &quot;The 
archbishop has sent the agent that vill take care of the job.  Ve simply 
have to confirm his arrival, then ve return to the Vatican.&quot;
 
&quot;Humph!&quot; snorted Yumie, who cast one last look at the priest&#39;s body.  
&quot;Possibly another milk run the archbishop wants us to run.  And Yumiko 
was starting to get to like Chicago.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Heinkel said as the two walked away. 
 
TO BE CONTINUED...
 
Author&#39;s note:  Yeah, I know, the ending&#39;s rushed and generally sucked.  
But I thought the chapter needed to get out soon, so I raced right 
through it.  I usually take my time with such things.
