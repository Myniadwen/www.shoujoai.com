<a href="../crossover/bshbreload-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The silver haired woman strode down the halls of the stately mansion, 
nodding recognition to those she passed. Her gray business suit hugged 
her body, the cross that she wore gleaming like her glasses. She 
stopped, &quot;Walter, I don&#39;t want to be disturbed again.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Integra-sama,&quot; Walter stepped from the shadows, executing a 
half bow in acknowledgment. His monocle gleamed as he straightened up 
before adding, &quot;Should I have dinner for two sent up later?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Integra flashed a smile before going into the nearby room.

The bedroom was quiet, and Integra locked the door behind her with a 
soft click. She strode across the stone floor, soles clicking, and 
smiled slightly as she approached the bed in the center of the large 
bedchamber. Satin sheets glowed in the dim light, the soft rose of the 
cloth contrasting sharply with the dusky skinned figure who lay atop 
them.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe that you left me like this!&quot;

Integra chuckled softly, &quot;It was an urgent meeting, Anthy.&quot;

Anthy growled, struggling against her bonds. She was nude, her violet 
hair framing her face, her slim arms bound over her head in silver 
handcuffs. Integra&#39;s eyes moved down to Anthy&#39;s round breasts, the 
darker nipples hard with excitement, a familiar scent filling the air.

&quot;Untie me,&quot; Anthy said quietly, a faint blush touching her cheeks.

Integra reached out gently, her skin pale against Anthy&#39;s darker shades 
as she traced her lips with a finger. She gently slid her hand down over 
the throat and to her chest, cupping a breast to feel the hard nipple 
poke against her skin.

&quot;You&#39;re lips may say no,&quot; Integra said softly, &quot;but your body says yes.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s cheeks went red, looking away from Integra uncomfortably. 
Integra chuckled as she stepped back, loosening her tie first to lay it 
on a dresser. Her coat slid off slim shoulders, revealing a white shirt 
and the shape of perky breasts. Shoes and socks were kicked off, Integra 
turning to slide her pants down, Anthy gasping softly in surprise.

&quot;Like them?&quot; Integra asked as she turned, the tiniest of black panties 
clinging to her curves. She flashed a smile as she undid her shirt, &quot;I 
wore them just for you.&quot;

&quot;You look lovely,&quot; Anthy breathed as Integra undid her shirt buttons, 
stalking towards the bed like a huntress seeking her prey. Her shirt 
dropped to the floor, her white breasts small but upthrust, nipples hard 
from excitement.

&quot;As do you,&quot; Integra climbed on the bed, crouching over Anthy&#39;s bound 
form. &quot;I should do this to you more often,&quot; she purred, &quot;chains suit 
you.&quot;

&quot;Integra,&quot; Anthy&#39;s voice was husky with want.

Integra swiftly bent forward, pressing her lips suddenly to Anthy&#39;s 
lips. She wound her hands in that violet colored mane, kissing with 
passionate intensity that Anthy eagerly returned. She slid down eagerly, 
lips finding those breasts that she often longed for, weighing them in 
her hands as Anthy loudly gasped in pleasure.

&quot;You look most beautiful,&quot; Integra slid her lips free from Anthy&#39;s 
breasts almost reluctantly, &quot;taken by this desire, you know.&quot;

All Anthy could do was moan her desire, her objections overruled by the 
wet heat spreading through her body. &quot;Please,&quot; she found herself saying, 
though she hadn&#39;t even intended to speak.

Integra slid down silently, watching with amusement mixed with desire as 
she saw Anthy spreading her legs, The sweet sent rose up and Integra let 
her fingers slide across the cure of that belly, dipping down below the 
purple haired triangle into wet heat.

&quot;Ahh!&quot; Anthy squealed, softly, hips bucking upward involuntarily. 
Wickedly Integra pulled her fingers back, keeping the barest contact on 
that sensitive flesh. &quot;Please!&quot; Anthy repeated.

Integra looked up at her, glasses gleaming as she met Anthy&#39;s desperate 
eyes. &quot;Beg,&quot; she said softly, keeping her touch delicate, &quot;beg for it.&quot;

Anthy&#39;s breasts heaved, her wide eyes meeting Integra&#39;s as they lay 
there on the bed in the moment of near silence. &quot;Please,&quot; she murmured, 
a second of hesitation before she continued on, &quot;please... mistress, let 
me come.&quot;

Integra smiled, teeth gleaming as she simply said, &quot;Of course.&quot;

A white hand rested on a dusky belly, stroking the skin as Integra 
gently slid first two fingers inside, three, then four. Anthy&#39;s eyes 
widened, &quot;You aren&#39;t going to....&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Integra cooed, carefully working her thumb into the wet velvet 
of the moaning girl&#39;s body. She slowly closed her hand into a fist, 
meeting her lover&#39;s eyes as she prepared. Anthy simply moaned, eyes 
cloudy with her desire and Integra chuckled wickedly.

&quot;Fuck me,&quot; Anthy hissed, savoring the coarse words

&quot;Of course,&quot; Integra drew her elbow back, working her arm like a piston 
and Anthy cried out in pure pleasure!

Walter paused in front of the door, listening to the sounds coming 
within, carefully balancing a food laden tray. He was about to knock 
when he lowered his hand, chuckling softly. &quot;I think I&#39;ll bring this 
back later,&quot; he murmured, carrying it off.

Sometime later the two women lay on the bed together, Integra gently 
holding Anthy close to her. The gleaming handcuffs had been cast aside 
some time ago, both women&#39;s bodies glowing with sweat and sexual 
satisfaction. Integra brought the cigar to her blips, drawing deep 
before carefully blowing the smoke away from her lover.

&quot;I almost expected you to use the safeword,&quot; Integra finally murmured, 
her breasts still aching pleasantly from Anthy&#39;s hungry mouth.

&quot;I nearly did,&quot; Anthy admitted, &quot;when you told be to beg.&quot; She looked 
up, smiling slightly as she said, &quot;You always seem to push me to my 
limits, Integra.&quot;

Integra just laughed softly. &quot;You surprised me, too,&quot; she said, her face 
near Anthy&#39;s, &quot;when you asked me to fuck you.&quot;

Anthy actually blushed as she said, &quot;It just slipped out.&quot; She let her 
hand slide down Integra&#39;s front, eventually cupping her panty covered 
mound, stroking gently through the wet cloth. &quot;I wish you&#39;d let me 
return the favor,&quot; she said.

Integra smiled a bit sadly, &quot;You know I can&#39;t, and you know why.&quot; The 
two of them lay there comfortably, the afterglow filling them both as 
they took some time to caught their breaths. &quot;Do you want something to 
eat?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I think I heard Walter knock earlier,&quot; Anthy admitted.

&quot;Wonder what he heard?&quot; Integra mused, reaching over for the bedside 
phone. She pressed a single button, her voice businesslike as she 
ordered two dinners be sent up to her room. The knock on the door came 
seconds later, and Integra rose to answer it.

&quot;You&#39;d better put a robe on,&quot; Anthy murmured, eyes studying Integra&#39;s 
slim form hungrily, &quot;or you might ruin your reputation.&quot;

Integra smiled slightly, cigar still clenched in her teeth as she pulled 
a black robe on. &quot;You should talk to Walter about it sometime,&quot; she 
calmly said as she went to the door, &quot;I&#39;ve had a reputation for years.&quot;

Integra collected the food and carried it back to the bed, the two 
settling down to eat. They fed each other using their fingers, licking 
any remaining crumbs away. Finally Anthy lay back with a soft sigh, &quot;Oh, 
that was good.&quot;

&quot;Yes it was,&quot; Integra agreed softly. She looked over at Anthy intently, 
her expression oddly blank then she said, &quot;You&#39;re leaving, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Anthy sighed quietly, sitting up with her back up against the headboard. 
&quot;I have to,&quot; she agreed, &quot;we&#39;ve finally gotten word of my brother.&quot;

Integra nodded, &quot;I suppose you won&#39;t let me send a team with you?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my responsibility,&quot; Anthy looked over at Integra fondly, &quot;he&#39;s my 
blood, no matter what sort of monster he&#39;s become.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll miss you, you know,&quot; Integra sighed, &quot;but I won&#39;t stop you, 
either.&quot; Anthy moved to get off the bed and she tried to stop her, &quot;Do 
you have to...?&quot;

Anthy looked back with a sad smile, &quot;I think it&#39;s better this way.&quot; With 
that she walked over to her neatly piled clothes, pulling a robe on and 
silently leaving with them.

Integra puffed out a breath in a sigh, then reached for the bedside 
phone. &quot;I want Anthy kept under surveillance on her trip to Japan,&quot; she 
ordered crisply, &quot;and a jet readied for immediate take off. If I need to 
go there, I want it ready.&quot;

Integra put the phone down, getting up out of her bed and striding over 
to her bathroom. The shower revived her a little, and she pulled on 
fresh clothes, quickly restoring her normal remote look. Integra opened 
her bedroom door, stopping only a moment to look back at the tangled 
sheets on the bed, then she was off.
