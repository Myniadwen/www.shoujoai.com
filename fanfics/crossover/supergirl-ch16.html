<a href="../crossover/supergirl-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>        &quot;May I say that I&#39;ve been quite impressed by what I&#39;ve heard of 
your exploits as Steel,&quot; Dinah smiled slightly, the tough older blonde 
looking her over coolly.

        &quot;I doubt they match the adventures of the Black Canary,&quot; B-ko 
answered calmly, &quot;but I hope to be able to measure up one day.&quot;

        Dinah met her eyes, clearly trying to intimidate the blue haired 
woman young who was looking back at her. After a moment she smiled a bit 
more naturally, &quot;You don&#39;t scare easily.&quot;

        &quot;Mom!&quot; Helena blurted.

        B-ko reached over to keep Helena from getting up out of her 
chair. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she smiled at the black haired woman, &quot;I&#39;m glad 
that your mothers worry enough about you to make sure your girlfriend is 
worthy of you.&quot;

        Barbara had to smile as she walked back into the living room, 
the braces on her legs clicking. &quot;I think she&#39;s got you there,&quot; she said 
to both Dinah and Helena as she sat down a tray of filled glasses. The 
redhead looked over at B-ko with a impish little grin and asked, &quot;So 
what sort of teammate is Helena, anyway?&quot;

        B-ko looked over at Helena before smiling gently, &quot;She&#39;s been a 
good one to me.&quot;

        Helena got up from the couch, &quot;I hate to leave you alone to face 
the inquisition, but I want to get changed before we go out for our 
night on the town.&quot;

        Only joking a little B-ko said, &quot;Hurry back, please.&quot;

        Barbara smiled gently at B-ko as Helena was leaving the room, 
&quot;It&#39;s all right, we won&#39;t grill you too badly.&quot;

        &quot;There actually was something I wanted to ask,&quot; B-ko admitted a 
bit uncomfortably.

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Dinah raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;Helena has mentioned her mother once or twice,&quot; B-ko said 
quietly, &quot;but the circumstances never seemed right to ask her.&quot; She 
frowned, &quot;I suppose I could have asked Oracle, but...&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not that big a secret, most of the information&#39;s public 
knowledge,&quot; Barbara admitted. She leaned forward to quietly say, &quot;Helena 
is a third generation superhero. Her mother was the daughter of 
Nightwing and his lover Starfire, who called herself Nightstar.&quot;

        &quot;I remember hearing the name,&quot; B-ko quietly admitted, &quot;but 
didn&#39;t she drop out of sight about fifteen years ago?&quot;

        &quot;Nightstar had fallen in love with Batman&#39;s illegitimate son, 
Ibn Al Xu&#39;ffasch or as Bruce called him, Thomas Wayne. The boy had been 
raised by the League of Assassins, groomed to be the successor of Ra&#39;s 
al Ghul, but he rebelled once he discovered his true heritage. He and 
Nightstar met, and they fell in love,&quot; Dinah said grimly.

        B-ko had the sinking feeling that there wasn&#39;t going to be a 
happy ending to all this. &quot;So what happened?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;The League decided that if they couldn&#39;t have Ibn, then no one 
would, so they arranged for his murder,&quot; Barbara took up the story 
softly. &quot;Nightstar gave birth to Helena a few months later, but she 
refused to have anything to do with the child. The last I heard, she 
left Earth completely to be with her mother&#39;s people,&quot; she explained.

        &quot;Batman and Nightwing were both mourning for their children in 
different ways,&quot; Dinah related quietly, &quot;so Babs and I ended up deciding 
to take Helena in.&quot;

        &quot;Something that I&#39;m eternally grateful for,&quot; Helena came back 
in, dressed in a simple but elegant black dress that went well with her 
dark hair.

        &quot;How much did you hear?&quot; B-ko looked up, worried that she might 
see anger in the young woman&#39;s eyes.

        &quot;Most of it,&quot; Helena was smiling a bit sadly. &quot;To be honest, I&#39;m 
glad you asked them about her,&quot; she admitted, &quot;I&#39;m usually a lot less 
nice talking about dear old mom.&quot;

        &quot;I can&#39;t blame you for that,&quot; B-ko took her hand in her own, 
thinking back to her own mother&#39;s actions, &quot;she did abandon you.&quot;

        Helena brought B-ko&#39;s hand to her lips, breathing in her scent 
before gently kissing the back. &quot;I couldn&#39;t agree more,&quot; she tossed a 
look at her two adopted mothers, &quot;though some people think I should just 
forgive and forget.&quot;

        &quot;I wouldn&#39;t go quite that far,&quot; Barbara chided her gently, &quot;but 
you should at least understand the reasons behind her actions, Helena.&quot;

        &quot;I do understand why she did it,&quot; Helena said quietly, the 
slightest tremor in her voice, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t make her actions any 
less contemptible.&quot;

        Not liking where this discussion was going B-ko tried to change 
the subject, &quot;What happened to the League of Assassins? Because I rather 
doubt that the Batman or Nightwing would let them get away with doing 
that.&quot;

        Dinah smiled a cold, dangerous smile, &quot;No one&#39;s quite sure. 
Batman and Nightwing dropped out of sight for a few weeks, and I think 
they went looking for them. I don&#39;t know what the two did, but no one&#39;s 
heard of the League since.&quot;

        Barbara&#39;s expression was rather sad as she added, &quot;And Bruce 
hasn&#39;t worn the Batman uniform since then.&quot;

        Helena&#39;s sighed slightly, &quot;I know all of this is interesting, 
but all I came for was to get changed.&quot; She smiled at her two Moms, 
&quot;Would you mind if I grab B-ko and get going?&quot;

        Dinah smirked, &quot;All right, and maybe I&#39;ll grab Babs for a bit 
while you&#39;re gone.&quot;

        Barbara blushed fiercely.

        Helena colored a bit as she and B-ko left the comfortable little 
apartment. &quot;You know, I think I like your moms,&quot; B-ko said cheerfully.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad they&#39;re the ones who raised me,&quot; Helena agreed. She 
shook her head, &quot;I still can&#39;t believe she said that, though. Too much 
information!&quot;

        &quot;I hope I&#39;ve got that king of vigor when I get older,&quot; B-ko 
chuckled softly.

        &quot;It&#39;s got it&#39;s downside,&quot; a smirking Helena remarked as the two 
of them stepped into an elevator, smoothly descending to the ground 
floor.

        &quot;Oh?&quot; B-ko raised an eyebrow while they walked into the lobby.

        Quietly Helena continued, &quot;I went out on patrol once, but it 
ended up being a pretty quiet night, so I went back home early.&quot; She 
lead the way outside, where she waved for a taxi, &quot;Guess they thought 
that I was going to be gone for awhile longer, because the two of them 
were getting pretty busy on the living room couch when I walked in.&quot;

        B-ko just had to laugh softly. With a grin she asked, &quot;So what 
did you do?&quot;

        &quot;I left very, very quietly,&quot; Helena chuckled, &quot;then went out to 
Gotham park and hung out with Dryad a while. When I finally went home I 
made sure to give them plenty of warning, too.&quot;

        &quot;Too bad I don&#39;t have any embarrassing parent stories,&quot; B-ko 
admitted as a Taxi coasted to a stop in front of them. Helena quite 
gentlemanly helped her in, then followed behind. &quot;My father was more 
likely to be making out with a secretary at work,&quot; she admitted.

        Helena made a face, &quot;Ick.&quot; She looked over at B-ko curiously, 
&quot;So what was it like meeting with your mother?&quot;

        &quot;Odd,&quot; B-ko admitted as they sat back in the seat to talk.

To be continued...

Authors Notes: Nightstar, as well as Ibn Al Xu&#39;ffasch were introduced in 
the comic series Kingdom Come. Ibn&#39;s mother was Talia, the daughter of 
Ra&#39;s Al Ghul, who put the child up for adoption after she had a romantic 
moment with Batman. Bruce believed that she had miscarried, a fact that 
Talia let him believe.</pre>
