<h1>St Manga School (part 5 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/stmanga-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Mr Edmund Blackadder, head of the history department in St Manga School 
had walked into his own classroom. Most of the students that he loved to 
hate were in the classroom. None of them looked particularly happy in 
the lesson, neither was he, but he enjoyed bullying them sometimes. His 
classroom was rather dark, due to the fact that he always preferred the 
darkness over the light. The room was rather plain, boring and 
miserable; just the way he liked it.

&quot;You had a cover lesson with Mr Baldric yesterday,&quot; Mr Blackadder 
announced searching through some paper works. &quot;Can anybody tell me, what 
you did in the previous lesson?&quot; The class remained silent, apart Ino 
was giggling with another girl next to her. &quot;Perhaps you can tell me 
Ino,&quot; He requested boldly he then faced the girl. &quot;Or maybe you Tent!&quot; 
Both girls gave him a nasty look.

&quot;Her name is Tenten,&quot; Ino corrected the teacher, &quot;Not Tent.&quot;

&quot;Tent - Tenten whatever,&quot; Blackadder replied. &quot;You&#39;re name is Tent in 
this classroom, that will just make things easier.&quot;

&quot;That just makes you a bully.&quot; Ino confirmed angrily. Blackadder marched 
towards Ino, he didn&#39;t seem angry, but not really calm either.

&quot;The more you shout out,&quot; Blackadder whispered in a sly manner. &quot;The 
more time you waste, on what could have been your education.&quot; He walked 
around the classroom resting paper work on his chest. &quot;Sasuke is not in 
again.&quot; He pointed out. &quot;The little skiving brat,&quot; Blackadder had 
muttered behind his breath, though Naruto overheard him.

&quot;Sasuke&#39;s not a brat!&quot; Naruto pointed out almost as angry as Ino and 
Tenten. &quot;He&#39;s been really ill lately.&quot;

&quot;Ah Naruto,&quot; Blackadder said cheerfully raising his hands in the air. 
&quot;The clown of the class pissed off! The student that every teacher loves 
to hate.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re the teacher that every student loves to hate!&quot; Naruto 
answered back sounding really mad.

&quot;So I guess we&#39;re even.&quot; Blackadder smiled. &quot;Students hate me, teachers 
hate you. I guess it&#39;s all equal. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t do fair.&quot; 
Blackadder grabbed onto his pencil case and aimed to the top right 
corner of the class and tossed it carelessly. The pencil case had 
slammed onto the back of Hinata Hyuga&#39;s head behind her sapphire hair 
locks. &quot;What a goal!&quot; Blackadder grinned.

&quot;You&#39;re an asshole!&quot; Naruto snapped holding onto his bag with the 
intention of packing. &quot;What the fuck did you do that for?&quot;

&quot;Why thank you Naruto,&quot; Blackadder replied standing in a proud and 
non-remorseful stance. &quot;The official retard of the class, with the mind 
of a disabled person and the brain of a five year old. As for that timid 
trash named Hinata, I simply threw your pencil case at her head, so she 
will be awake in the lesson and will hopefully speak.&quot;

&quot;Insult her like that again,&quot; Naruto warned Blackadder, &quot;I will 
seriously knock you out!&quot;

&quot;You give me no choice, but to report you to the principle.&quot; Blackadder 
announced calmly.

&quot;Whatever,&quot; Naruto replied quickly walking over to Hinata and collecting 
his pencil case, &quot;I&#39;ve got detention with Granny Tsunade anyway, won&#39;t 
make such a difference!&quot; Blackadder was aware that Naruto was about to 
walk out of the classroom. He silently breathed a sigh of relief, 
walking away from Naruto quietly waiting for the right time to speak.

&quot;If you&#39;re going to walk out of my classroom,&quot; Blackadder sneered as he 
marched slowly to his whiteboard. &quot;Take Hinata with you.&quot;

Naruto harshly opened the door as he evilly glared at Blackadder. 
Blackadder grinned without any sign of remorse as he watched Naruto grab 
Hinata&#39;s hand gently. Blackadder decided to open the door for both of 
them. &quot;Sometime this week would be delightful,&quot; He commented 
sarcastically.

&quot;Shut up you stupid bastard!&quot; Naruto spat back as he stormed out of the 
classroom. Hinata quickly followed him after closing the door after her.

&quot;Good riddance,&quot; Blackadder muttered. &quot;Hate them two. One&#39;s too loud; 
the other&#39;s too quiet. They&#39;d make an interesting couple. Needless to 
say, their children would be retarded.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so horrible!&quot; Kari shouted out looking angrier than she would 
normally be. &quot;Neither of them are retards! The only retard in this one 
is you. Why do you have to be so cruel to us all the time?&quot;

&quot;It is the way of life Kari,&quot; Blackadder replied appearing sincere and 
evil at the same time. &quot;Life is not fair, and the truth is painful like 
anal rape caused by an elephant with needles stuck into you and being 
stung by a million wasps. Something you all need to learn.&quot;

&quot;Mankey!&quot; Davis let out, in a distained way. &quot;I do not want to imagine 
that,&quot; Davis whispered to himself pulling his face in sheer disgust.

&quot;The only thing he can teach us is how to bully people.&quot; Kari muttered 
to Davis. &quot;I mean, it&#39;s every lesson, he picks on students. Too much 
bullying in this school.&quot; She pointed out. &quot;Most of it&#39;s from him.&quot; She 
banged her desk loudly on the table. &quot;He is so pissing me off. Naruto 
was smart walking out of this class.&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re walking out I&#39;ll join you.&quot; Davis told her. They both looked 
at Blackadder who was staring at the pair of them as though he was 
waiting for them.

&quot;Now we&#39;ve had some drama,&quot; Blackadder announced. &quot;Let&#39;s get back to 
history. Turn to page one hundred and sixty nine in your books and write 
some notes while you&#39;re at it.&quot; He sat down at his desk and noticed Ino 
was sitting there, arms crossed with her textbook firmly shut. &quot;That 
includes you Ino,&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I should any work in this lesson today.&quot; Ino replied 
softly.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Cause you&#39;re a bully.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Blackadder sighed angrily. &quot;The blonde bimbo has replaced the 
clown of the class.&quot; He looked around the students whilst pointing at 
Ino. He and Ino had found themselves in a staring contest. She was 
finding it diffulcult not to laugh, whilst he was finding it hard to 
keep his anger in control. She watched Blackadder&#39;s fist start to shake 
pretty violently as his teeth gritted.

&quot;Calm down dear,&quot; Ino smiled. &quot;It&#39;s only a commercial!&quot; Ino and Tenten 
bursted out with high pitched giggles, the rest of the class quickly 
joined in. Blackadder stood up and spied Ino with a disgusting glare, 
after ten seconds of glaring he finally decided to flip, marching in 
explosion to Ino&#39;s desk then banging his fist sharply onto his table.

&quot;For goodness sake Ino, get on with your work!&quot; Demanded Blackadder 
loudly.&quot;...otherwise, there will be Hell to pay.&quot;

&quot;I am not listening to anything you say.&quot; Ino replied calmly, whilst 
crossing her arms tighter. &quot;Until you say that you&#39;re a loser and that 
you&#39;re going to apologise for being mean.&quot;

&quot;Shut up you bimbo!&quot; Blackadder snapped leaning back on his chair.

&quot;You know Naruto&#39;s so gonna get you for this,&quot; Sakura pointed out. &quot;If 
Sasuke was here, he&#39;d give you a black eye.&quot;

&quot;Not if I get them expelled they can&#39;t.&quot; Blackadder replied in a 
confident tone. &quot;Get on with your work, or you can join them.&quot;

&quot;I think I might join them actually.&quot; Sakura said in a relieved tone 
hastily dragging her bag on the table placing her stuff in it. &quot;Anyone 
else want to join me?&quot;

The class cheered in a sigh of relief. Sakura stared into Blackadder&#39;s 
eyes, and she noticed him also grinning. &quot;Class dismissed.&quot; Blackadder 
replied as he returned to his desk and watched the History class leave. 
&quot;Last one out close the door behind you.&quot;
