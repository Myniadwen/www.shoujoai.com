<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 80 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/locket-ch79.html">Back to Part 79</a><pre>&quot;All right, Midori,&quot; Natsuki Kuga scowled, the dark
blue haired woman following as the group headed up the
back street in Fuka. &quot;What&#39;s so special about this
club, anyway?&quot;

Midori Sugiura smiled, the redhead&#39;s hair looking as
rooster like as ever as she lead the way. &quot;I&#39;m working
part time there for extra cash,&quot; she explained,
wearing her usual red shirt, jean jacket and pants,
&quot;and figured it&#39;d be right up your alley.&quot;

&quot;Oh, a tea room?&quot; Shizuru Fujino asked innocently, her
red eyes half closed as she held on to Natsuki&#39;s arm.

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Midori laughed.

&quot;It isn&#39;t one of those divergent sex clubs, is it?&quot;
Haruka Suzushiro asked, the blonde wearing a simple
green dress that hugged the younger woman&#39;s form.

&quot;Deviant, Haruka,&quot; Yukino Kikukawa corrected, blushing
faintly as the reddish brown haired girl walked beside
her.

&quot;If it is, that&#39;d be so exciting!&quot; Aoi Senoh said
excitedly, her long brown hair flowing around her. She
walked while holding Chie&#39;s arm, the two clearly a
couple, both dressed casually for a night out with
their friends.

Chie Harada grinned, her black hair cut boyishly
short. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed, &quot;maybe we&#39;ll get to see
Natsuki and Shizuru making out like they did at the
prom.&quot;

Natsuki blushed while Shizuru smirked.

&quot;It&#39;s a nice club with food, drink and dancing,&quot;
Midori laughed, &quot;I think you&#39;ll all have a good time.&quot;
She looked over at her companion, &quot;Right Yoko?&quot;

Yoko Sagisawa rolled her eyes behind her fashionable
glasses. &quot;Why are you asking me?&quot; she asked, &quot;It&#39;s the
first time I&#39;ve been there too.&quot; She looked most
unlike a school nurse in the tight pants and tube top,
but the sexy style suited her.

As they came around a corner Midori grinned, &quot;Here we
go!&quot;

The nightclub, set nearby an alley, was very busy,
with women going inside in small groups, chattering
happily. Above the door was a neon sign reading
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket, and beside it was a animated image
of a locket opening up to reveal two women in a loving
embrace.

&quot;Hey Midori!&quot; the woman watching the door waved, her
red hair shorter than Midori&#39;s and a bit brighter
colored. She was dressed in a red shirt and black
pants of Chinese design, snug fitting and kind of
sexy.

&quot;This is Ranma Saotome,&quot; Midori smiled as she
continued, &quot;a absolute letch. Watch her hands, she&#39;s
been known to pinch.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Ranma protested, &quot;it was just the one time.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Yoko asked, the older woman looking
surprisingly dangerous all of a sudden.

Ranma smiled winningly, &quot;Ah, you&#39;re her girlfriend?&quot;
She backed up a bit as she added, &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t
know, really...&quot;

Yoko eased off a bit, &quot;It had better not happen
again.&quot;

With that, the group headed inside as Ranma breathed a
sigh of relief. &#39;Remind me not to annoy her,&#39; she
mused, turning her attention to other flirting
possibilities.

&quot;Welcome back, Midori,&quot; Alpha smiled, the green haired
android taking a turn at hosting duties. She bowed to
the others, &quot;Can I take your coats or...?&quot;

Aoi clutched Chie&#39;s arm as she squealed excitedly,
&quot;She&#39;s SO cute! Can we take her home with us?&quot;

Midori laughed, &quot;I think her girlfriend would object.&quot;
She lead the way in as she added, &quot;Let&#39;s find a table,
shall we?&quot;

The inside of the bar was surprisingly large, with a
great deal of things going on. Towards the back of the
large room was a busy bar, two women serving drinks,
while to one side was a dance floor packed with people
and a kareoke stage. On the other side was a set of
tables for eating and taking, while just beside it was
a library, rows of shelves and seats waiting for the
interested.

&quot;This is the first bar I&#39;ve seen with a library,&quot;
Yukino murmured, looking with surprise at the reading
area as they sat at a large table nearby.

Haruka smiled slightly, &quot;We&#39;ll go over and take a look
later.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Haruka,&quot; Yukino smiled happily.

A waitress hurried over, her brown hair tied back in a
long braid. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Keiko,&quot; she said, &quot;what can I get
you?&quot;

&quot;A beef sandwich,&quot; Natsuki shrugged, still looking
around the bar in awe, &quot;with extra mayo.&quot;

&quot;Why am I not surprised?&quot; Shizuru murmured, smiling at
her lover fondly. Looking back at Keiko she said,
&quot;Could I have a salad? With extra green onions, too.&quot;

&quot;Yoko?&quot; Midori asked, and the doctor waved that she
could order for them both. &quot;Burgers and fries,
please,&quot; she grinned.

&quot;You act like such a teenager,&quot; Yoko growled even as
Haruka, Yukino, Chie and Aoi all gave their orders,
the waitress then hurrying off.

&quot;I am seventeen,&quot; Midori winked. Everyone groaned at
that and she pouted, &quot;I am!&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Natsuki mused, &quot;I could always hire Yamada
to hack the school database. I bet I could find out
your real age that way.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare,&quot; Midori frowned.

&quot;Bad Natsuki,&quot; Shizuru leaned close to purr into her
ear, making the other girl blush.

&quot;So,&quot; Minagi asked as the blue haired alien poured
drinks for the table, &quot;what do you think of &#39;em?&quot;

&quot;Nice kids,&quot; Keiko admitted, &quot;but I get a interesting
vibe from two of them, the blue haired girl and the
one from Kyoto.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; MInagi raised her eyebrow.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure why,&quot; Kelko added the drinks to the food
trays as she mused, &quot;but I think they&#39;re dangerous.&quot;

The food was quickly delivered, and as Midori had
promised it was as good if not better than any of the
places around Fuka. &quot;I wonder if we could kidnap the
cook and take her back with us?&quot; Chie mused as they
ate happily.

&quot;What we really should do is get Mai cooking for the
school cafeteria,&quot; Aoi pointed out. She frowned, &quot;Too
bad she couldn&#39;t come along today.&quot;

Natsuki snickered softly, &quot;She&#39;s busy.&quot; As everyone
looked at her she explained, &quot;She, Tate, Shiho, Reito
and Mikoto are all having dinner, probably with Reito
and Tate glaring suspiciously at each other, Shiho
watching Mai suspiciously and Mikoto trying to keep
them all away from her Mai.&quot;

&quot;Mai certainly is populous,&quot; Haruka noted.

&quot;That&#39;s popular,&quot; Yukino corrected. She smiled as she
took Haruka&#39;s hand then looked at the table, &quot;Could
you excuse us?&quot;

&quot;Those two look good together,&quot; Chie noted as Yukino
and Haruka walked over to the library together,
talking softly.

&quot;Take a photo,&quot; Aoi added as Chie pulled her phone
out, &quot;it&#39;d make good blackmail material if Haruka
starts getting cranky.&quot;

Midori laughed softly as she asked them, &quot;I wonder how
long it&#39;ll take Haruka to realize all the books there
are lesbian novels?&quot;

&quot;Seriously?&quot; Natsuki blinked.

&quot;Why,&quot; Shizuru asked innocently, &quot;does my Natsuki want
to borrow a few?&quot;

&quot;Shizuru!&quot; Natsuki blushed.

&quot;Come on, Chie,&quot; Aoi said after a moment, &quot;I want to
go do kareoke, and someone just quit.&quot; Chie willingly
followed as they hurried off, the rest of them gazing
after in amusement.

&quot;Is it me, or are they scarily perky?&quot; Midori mused.

Yoko sighed as she ate a french fry off Midori&#39;s
plate, &quot;If you and I weren&#39;t the supervising teachers
for the Fuka Gay Society, I&#39;d never put up with them.&quot;

Shizuru chuckled, &quot;They&#39;re charming, in a innocent
sort of way.&quot; A slow song came on and she smiled,
&quot;Natsuki, you promised me a dance.&quot;

Natsuki looked surprised, then smiled in realization.
&quot;So I did,&quot; she took Shizuru&#39;s hand and they both
headed off, disappearing into the crowds.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Midori asked.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; the waitress returned. Keiko set down the
bill for the food and asked, &quot;How will you be paying?&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Yoko chuckled, &quot;they stuck you with the bill!&quot;

&quot;Shizuru, Haruka,&quot; Midori yelled irritably, &quot;get your
rich butts back here!&quot;

&quot;Midori,&quot; Keiko scolded, &quot;keep it down.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Midori reluctantly got out her wallet as
she vowed, &quot;I&#39;m taking the cost of this meal out of
their hides later.&quot;

To be continued...

romance, once. Heh.</pre>
