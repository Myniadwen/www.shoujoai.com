<a href="../crossover/jetiendo-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>May was fast asleep; Ash woke up, the shock of today which turned around 
completely. Then the door opened Tasha; Ash&#39;s half sister came in and 
threw her purple cloak to her left arm 

&quot; I&#39;ve didn&#39;t get a chance to talk to you well&quot; Tasha whispered. 

&quot; You had to pick the middle of the night to talk to me&quot; Ash replied 

&quot; I&#39;m sorry, forgive me&quot; 

&quot; Tasha, can I ask you a question? Why do I look so ... why do I look so 
similar to Garnet?&quot; 

&quot; I don&#39;t know&quot; Tasha answered. &quot; My father and uncle Bill where twins. 
Angelica married Bill Bo after her husband died, Roy&#39;s dad. Then Garnet 
was born and then years later he went to God.&quot; 

&quot; Sorry,&quot; Ash replied &quot; what about your mom Ila?&quot; 

&quot; Ila&#39;s my step-mom&quot; Tasha replied &quot; My mother Cleanses died of 
child-birth&quot; 

&quot;Death must be a friend round here&quot; 

&quot; Death is a very known fact indeed. What about your mother?&quot; 

&quot; She&#39;s fine, I hope, She&#39;s always been missing me all the time&quot; 

&quot; Well, when my father discovered I wanted to live in the monastary he 
was devastated he visited me 24/7&quot; 

&quot; So what about the throne,&quot; Ash asked &quot; what would happen if Dad died 
which one of us will get the throne?&quot; 

&quot;I think it will be either you or Roy&quot; Tasha replied, &quot; Usually it&#39;s 
kings son or the next eldest male heir to the throne &quot; 

&quot; Well ain&#39;t I illegitimate so I won&#39;t count.&quot; 

&quot; Yeah Roy will be king then,&quot; Tasha &quot; but if he died childless as well 
I think it will go to Aunt Angelica, then it will go to me if she is 
childless.&quot; 

&quot; And after Aunt Angelica?&quot; 

&quot; One of us&quot; Tasha replied, &quot; Anyway we mustn&#39;t worry. Life expectancy 
is shooting up we&#39;ll only need to worry about that about 50 years time. 
For now Goodnight&quot; 

then Tasha the devout older sister that Ash never knew about, who was in 
love with his friend Gary walked out the door but before she left she 
said to her brother 

&quot;and another thing Satoshi&quot; Tasha said to her brother &quot;no sex before 
marriage&quot; </pre>
