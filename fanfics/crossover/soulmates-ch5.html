<h1>Soulmates (part 5 of 5)</h1>

<a href="../crossover/soulmates-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>In the pale blue light that came in through the window from the city on 
the horizon, Samus sat on a chair by her bed. With a heavy heart she 
watched over the sleeping form resting within, wondering if this was 
reality or a dream. If she climbed back into bed would she be alone 
again when she woke up in the morning? She wasn&#39;t sure why it bothered 
her so much; she&#39;d been alone her whole life, so it shouldn&#39;t be any big 
deal. But the loneliness she had experienced after knowing what it was 
like to be with someone was far worse. It was a crushing, inescapable 
feeling.  

She remembered the day that feeling began like it was yesterday even 
though it was six months prior. She had come home, not from a long job, 
but from a twenty-minuet run to get some food, only to find her tiny 
house suddenly felt much larger. Now empty, this hovel of a home was far 
too big for her alone, she felt almost lost in it. Nicole was no longer 
there. 

The only evidence she&#39;d ever been there was the note left on her pillow. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot; was all it said. And even though it hurt like nothing else 
she ever experienced, Samus wasn&#39;t surprised. Things weren&#39;t as simple 
as just declaring their love for each other. Managing a relationship 
turned out to be a difficult thing, which neither was prepared for. They 
certainly had their fair share of problems. Things were complicated by 
that fact that neither of them were home much; bounty hunting took up 
long stretches of time, especially for Samus. 

Nicole&#39;s initial concern turned out to be well founded; the type of 
people they were, while very compatible with each other, simply weren&#39;t 
compatible to living like that. Though they lasted a lot longer than 
either expected, Nicole had stuck around for five months after they 
first met, two months after they realized they loved each other. That 
was a generous period of time, Samus thought. She should feel lucky they 
had that much at least. 

Samus took a deep breath, and sighed out slowly. If this was a dream she 
didn&#39;t want to wake. She reached down and ran her hand through the 
sleeping woman&#39;s shoulder length, light-brown hair. 

&quot;You really came back to me,&quot; she whispered, half asking, half making a 
statement. Of course there was no response. 

Nicole had come back into her life just as suddenly and in a similar 
fashion to how she had left. Earlier that day, Samus headed out to 
restock on food. When she opened the front door Nicole was there again. 
Just like that.  

She stood there facing Samus, not two feet away, looking exactly the 
same as the day she left, exactly how Samus remembered her. She wouldn&#39;t 
look Samus in the eye though. And it seemed like an eternity before 
either of them spoke. 

&quot;How long have you been there?&quot; Samus asked finally. 

&quot;A while...&quot; Nicole sounded sad. &quot;I couldn&#39;t bring myself to knock,&quot; she 
said, and the silence continued for a second eternity as Samus just 
stared at her blankly. Why wouldn&#39;t she say anything? 

Nicole bit her lower lip and looked contemplatively at Samus. Why did 
she come back? What was she thinking? This was probably a mistake. 
Nicole could feel her eyes moisten... no! She wouldn&#39;t cry! She was a 
SPARTAN, she was stronger than that. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she choked out finally. 

Samus winced, then hung her head and turned around, heading back inside. 
&quot;You said that already.&quot; 

This was definitely a mistake. Nicole had to fight not to completely 
break down.  

&quot;Well... come in already,&quot; Samus said flatly. 

&quot;Uh, r-right... okay.&quot; Nicole swallowed the lump in her throat and 
walked back through the door she&#39;d walked out of six months ago. 

&quot;Want something to drink?&quot; 

&quot;Thanks...&quot; Nicole said. Samus had never heard her sound so disheartened 
before. 

She got them a couple of drinks from the refrigerator and handed one to 
Nicole. &quot;So... what have you been up to?&quot; Samus said as she sat at the 
counter.  

Nicole followed suit, sitting as well. &quot;The same... hunting. You?&quot; 

&quot;Same. You got yourself a place now?&quot; 

&quot;Uh... well... it&#39;s mostly been motels. I move around a lot.&quot; 

&quot;Oh...&quot; Samus responded and took another long pause. &quot;Where&#39;s your 
armor?&quot;  

&quot;Rented storage. It&#39;s cheaper, more secure than most places.&quot; Nicole 
said. The silence returned as Samus only stared at her again. Unable to 
take the silence she continued the meaningless conversation. &quot;I&#39;ve been 
modifying it. Making upgrades using federation technology. The shields 
are stronger now, and I improved the...&quot; she trailed off, and sighed. 
&quot;Samus, I--&quot; 

&quot;I know why you left.&quot; Samus interrupted. &quot;I might have too... This... 
domestic life just doesn&#39;t suit us.&quot;  

&quot;What?&quot; Nicole talked on top of her. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure you felt so confined here, held back, limited... maybe like 
you were dependent on me.&quot; Samus continued. 

&quot;N-no... Samus... You&#39;re wrong, that wasn&#39;t it at all,&quot; Nicole said 
shaking her head. &quot;Samus I... I worry about you. I know it&#39;s ridiculous 
but I do. I&#39;ve lost people in combat before. It&#39;s terrible, but we all 
know the risks and accept it. But....&quot; Nicole sighed and stared at her 
glass. 

&quot;I- I couldn&#39;t accept it if something happened to you,&quot; she said and 
glanced at Samus. 

Samus still only stared blankly at her. 

&quot;What we do is dangerous... so dangerous. And I know you. You- well I 
know you&#39;re a better warrior than me... but... you&#39;re reckless... You 
take unnecessary risks and endanger yourself needlessly. Every time you 
went out on a job...&quot; 

She again looked to Samus to see if she would give any sign of what she 
was feeling. Nothing. 

&quot;Sometimes... sometimes I worry so much I make myself sick. Actually, 
physically sick. Waiting here at home for days, sometimes a week, not 
knowing if you&#39;d ever come back. I couldn&#39;t take it. I&#39;m used to doing 
something about things like that. But what could I do? I could never 
follow you; I could never keep up with you. I thought if I left, if I 
distanced myself from you...&quot; 

Nicole took a deep breath. Suddenly becoming aware of how dry her mouth 
was, she took a drink from her glass. 

&quot;I was okay for a while... but I... I ended up only worrying more in the 
end... and not just about you&#39;re safety but about... you. How you... 
felt about the whole thing... and... ugh...&quot; 

Samus still stared at her, with her typically impossible to read 
expression. At least she hadn&#39;t changed any. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry--&quot; 

&quot;Stop saying that,&quot; Samus snapped. 

Nicole recoiled a bit. She swallowed the lump in her throat. &quot;You 
probably hate me now... I understand.&quot; She stood and sighed. Samus 
looked down at her glass and said nothing. Nodding, Nicole turned and 
walked away. 

&quot;I did... I did hate you...&quot; Samus said softly &quot;...for about an hour. 
Then... then I just missed you.&quot;  

Nicole turned to face her again and Samus stood from the counter.  

&quot;I missed you so badly,&quot; she continued. &quot;And I worried about you too. 
Every night I went to sleep and I couldn&#39;t hold you and know how you 
were doing, I&#39;d worry too! I&#39;d worry if you were taking care of 
yourself, did you have a place to sleep, were you earning enough to 
support yourself, were you...were you still alive... If something 
happened to you... I couldn&#39;t accept it either.&quot; 

Nicole ran up to her but stopped short of trying to hug her like she 
desperately wanted to. She wasn&#39;t sure where things stood between them, 
but Samus answered that when she hugged Nicole first. The blond let out 
a single sob as she rested her head on the other woman&#39;s shoulder.  

Nicole put her arms around the huntress and squeezed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Samus shook her head. &quot;Don&#39;t say that to me.&quot; 

&quot;But I--&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s what you said...what you wrote that day,&quot; Samus mumbled into her 
shoulder. &quot;I hate hearing those words now. It just reminds me of then.&quot; 

&quot;I... I won&#39;t then. Just... I never meant to hurt you.&quot; 

&quot;You did,&quot; Samus said sadly. 

&quot;I&#39;m s-- I feel terrible about that.&quot; 

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you just tell me all this instead of running away?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah right.&quot; Nicole huffed. &quot;How could I? How could I possibly say 
something like that? How could I tell you, the Great Samus Aran, than 
I&#39;m worried you aren&#39;t good enough and might screw up and get hurt? Who 
the hell am I to criticize you?&quot; 

&quot;The Great Samus Aran?&quot; Samus shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m not that person... 
not with you. I&#39;m just Sammy... your Sammy.&quot;  

&quot;Samus...&quot; Nicole hesitated. She wanted to apologize desperately, but 
knew she couldn&#39;t. &quot;Where do we... where do we stand? I mean, are you 
and I--&quot; 

&quot;Why did you come back?&quot; Samus cut her off. &quot;What are you expecting? 
Would you want me to change? To quit? To not be a hunter any more?&quot; 

&quot;Well...&quot; 

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t know what else to do with myself. This is all I know. And I 
can&#39;t change the way I fight. You say I&#39;m reckless, but I only do what I 
think is best; what ever I think is the best course of action. I 
wouldn&#39;t even know how to begin to change that.&quot; She pulled back to look 
Nicole in the eyes. &quot;Are you okay with all that?&quot; 

Nicole was silent for a moment before answering. &quot;I... I am,&quot; she said 
hesitantly. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want you to change who you are.&quot;  

&quot;Then stay... Stay with me. Please.&quot;  

&quot;Mmm... &quot; Nicole nodded. &quot;If I&#39;m close to you, if I can keep an eye on 
you.... well then maybe I won&#39;t worry so much.&quot; 

Samus wiped the tears from her eyes and took another long look at Nicole 
who was sleeping peacefully. She lay on her stomach with the sheets only 
half covering her. Samus observed the lines of her back change ever so 
slightly with the rise and fall of her lungs. Skin highlighted by the 
gentle blue glow form the city had an ethereal quality to it. She again 
ran her fingers through the other woman&#39;s hair. Enticed by the vision of 
beauty, she let her hand trail all the way down her back, enjoying once 
again the feel of warm skin instead of cold, empty bed sheets. She had 
missed this terribly.  

Samus climbed back into bed and snuggled up against her lover, kissed 
Nicole on the forehead and put her arm around her bare shoulders. &quot;You 
really did come back,&quot; she whispered again. This couldn&#39;t be a dream, 
her dreams were only ever nightmares, terrors from her past; she never 
had pleasant ones so this must be real.  
 
 

------ 

The two picked up where they had left off and things returned to pretty 
much normal for them. However it was about a month later, when Samus 
came home from a short stint of hunting that something was unusual. She 
landed her ship and entered the house. Calling out to Nicole didn&#39;t get 
her an answer, and she though she mustn&#39;t be home. She went in to the 
bathroom for a shower, as was her custom after coming home from a job. 
She wanted to wash off the literal and figurative filth from her work. 

When she entered the bathroom she was pounced on by Nicole, who wasted 
no time or words in making her intentions known. Their clothes hit the 
floor in a frenzy as they stumbled into the shower, limbs and tongues 
intertwined. It wasn&#39;t unusual for them to make love in the shower, 
however the level of enthusiasm and passion Nicole displayed was. She 
pinned Samus against the back wall of the shower and practically 
assaulted her with kisses and ministrations. When it was over she left 
the huntress a shaking wreck, slowly sliding down the wall until she was 
sitting, and left the room without a word having been spoken between 
them.  

Normally they were equal partners, but this time it was apparently all 
about her. Samus wasn&#39;t selfish; Nicole simply never left her a chance 
to respond. The former solider had clearly won this round. She achieved 
her objective with professional level efficiency and escaped without the 
enemy having fired a shot. 

When Samus got out of the shower Nicole was already dry and dressed, and 
had one of the huntress&#39;s outfits in hand. Nicole snatched the towel off 
of her, tossing it to the floor.  

&quot;Hurry and get dressed,&quot; she said and handed Samus half the articles of 
clothing, then started dressing her in the other half on her own. 

&quot;Why? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Samus asked cautiously as Nicole fastened her 
bra for her. 

&quot;I have something I want to show you.&quot; 

She had them board Samus&#39; ship and take off. Nicole gave her a set of 
coordinates a few light-minuets away and they were off. 

&quot;Want to tell me where we&#39;re going?&quot; Samus was now more than intrigued; 
Nicole wasn&#39;t usually one to play games like this. 

&quot;It&#39;s a surprise.&quot;  

Nicole stood behind the pilot&#39;s seat, playing with Samus&#39; hair and 
occasionally nibbling on her ear or neck. It only took them a few 
minuets to get where they were going, but when they approached their 
destination something suddenly blinded Samus. Nicole had wrapped a small 
cloth over her face so she couldn&#39;t see. 

&quot;Nicky! What are you doing!?&quot; Samus said quite alarmed. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got the controls. We won&#39;t crash.&quot; She slipped her 
hand into Samus&#39; and squeezed. &quot;You trust me, right?&quot; 

Of course she did; with her very life. It didn&#39;t need to be said; she 
only squeezed Nicole&#39;s hand back. She slouched in her chair as a wave 
relaxation washed over her. This was why she loved Nicole; no one else 
was capable of making her feel like this. 

They set down somewhere and Samus heard the alarm that signaled external 
pressurization. They must have entered an air lock. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; Nicole led her by the hand as they exited the ship through 
the top hatch. As they stood atop the ship Nicole suddenly grabbed Samus 
and lifted her up, catching her up from under her shoulders and beneath 
the knees. &quot;It not safe to jump down if you can&#39;t see,&quot; she explained. 

With her girlfriend cradled in her arms, Nicole leaped to the ground and 
started walking. Samus could hear a set of doors hiss and slide open. 

&quot;You can set me down, I can walk now,&quot; Samus complained, though she 
didn&#39;t mind it one bit. 

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Nicole hummed and gave her a kiss on the cheek &quot;I could... but 
I don&#39;t want to.&quot; 

Nicole carried her a short distance more and eventually set her on her 
feet. &quot;Sit down,&quot; she said.  

Samus felt around behind her and found there was a solid object there. 
As she sat down she asked, &quot;Can I take this off now?&quot; 

&quot;In a while.&quot; Nicole said and sat beside her. Samus could feel her hair 
being played with. &quot;First, can you guess what today is?&quot; 

&quot;Tuesday?&quot;  

&quot;Guess again...&quot; Nicole said softly, and Samus felt fingers run up the 
length of her arm. 

&quot;The eighteenth?&quot;  

&quot;Sorry...&quot; Nicole whispered in her ear, then there were lips on her 
neck.  

Samus quivered, every touch was a surprise and the sensations were 
heightened in her sightless state.  

&quot;Is it your birthday?&quot;  

&quot;That&#39;s not it.&quot;  

Her face was caressed and a thumb ran delicately across her lips. 

&quot;Is it mine?&quot; Samus asked, now completely at a loss.  

&quot;No, but I did get you a present.&quot;  

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know then.&quot;  

Nicole leaned up against Samus and put her head on her shoulder. 
&quot;Exactly one year ago today...&quot; she said as she began to remove the 
blindfold from Samus&#39; eyes. &quot;We met for the first time.&quot; Nicole drew her 
close as her eyes were uncovered. &quot;And you kissed me... just... like... 
this,&quot; she said as their lips met in one of their softest kisses since 
that day; though this one lasted far longer. 

Samus&#39; eyes were wide with surprise as she realized; Nicole was 
reenacting their first time together. She quickly melted into the 
moment, wrapping her arms around her lover. This was almost perfect; now 
if only they were... wait a minuet... Samus&#39; eyes darted from side to 
side, taking in her surroundings. Her mouth had forgotten to continue 
kissing.  

Nicole couldn&#39;t help but grin as their lips parted, realizing what Samus 
had noticed. &quot;Like it?&quot; 

&quot;This place is...&quot; 

&quot;Where we met.&quot; Nicole finished her sentence. 

They were sitting on a bench is a small park under a glass dome roof 
with a view of the stars. &quot;You... you recreated it... We&#39;re in a 
holo-room? I had no idea you could be so romantic.&quot; 

&quot;Well I&#39;m not really. I saw it in a movie,&quot; Nicole admitted. &quot;The 
blindfold, the reenactment, all of it. I just thought it would be a good 
idea to try. But this place isn&#39;t an illusion. Something much better...&quot; 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s the real thing.&quot; 

&quot;Real? This is the actual module from that station? But how did...&quot; 

&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy,&quot; Nicole explained, &quot;but I eventually tracked it down. 
Once the Federation was done examining it they were just going to scrap 
it for materials. They were going to tear it apart! But I bought it... 
it&#39;s ours now. We can come here anytime we want.&quot; 

&quot;Bought it... How did you afford this... even if it was just going to be 
scrap?&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t think I only lived out of motels these past months because 
that was all I could afford?&quot; Nicole asked. 

&quot;You were saving for this? All that time?&quot; 

&quot;I was saving, but I didn&#39;t expect to buy this. I just... I don&#39;t 
know... I couldn&#39;t bring myself to settle someplace else. My home was... 
even when we were apart, it was always with you.&quot; 

&quot;Oh... Nicole,&quot; Samus sighed. She laid her hand on Nicole&#39;s cheek and 
stared into her eyes with a soft smile. Their lips met once more, and 
Samus maneuvered Nicole on to her back so they were lying on the bench.  

&quot;We&#39;ve come a long way since then, haven&#39;t we?&quot; Samus asked, tucking a 
strand of Nicole&#39;s hair behind her ear. 

&quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; Nicole nodded. &quot;This place sure brings back those times. 
Remember?&quot; 

&quot;I can never forget.&quot; 

&quot;We were so timid and nervous with each other then,&quot; Nicole said, 
blushing as she remembered. 

&quot;That&#39;s not how I remember,&quot; Samus disputed. &quot;I was nervous... you... 
you always seem so much more confident than me.&quot; 

&quot;I was nervous too... I guess I just suppress it better. In the military 
they teach you to hide your fear during basic.&quot; Nicole said, kissing 
Samus again briefly. &quot;You never answered my question.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm?&quot; 

&quot;Do you like it? Your present?&quot; 

Samus nodded, &quot;I love it... I love you.&quot; She brought herself down on 
Nicole with renewed passion, and soon found her hands wandering of their 
own accord. Her touch was deceptively soft, Nicole never saw it coming 
when she... 

&quot;Samus!?&quot; Nicole gasped.  

The huntress smirked and let a small chuckle escape her throat. &quot;You 
thought your little sneak attack in the shower would go unanswered? I 
have a score to settle.&quot; Nicole saw that warrior&#39;s instinct flash in her 
eyes; a look she infrequently saw, a look that even scared her a little. 
&quot;You&#39;d better be prepared; I won&#39;t be taken lightly.&quot;
