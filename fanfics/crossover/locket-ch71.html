<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 71 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/locket-ch70.html">Back to Part 70</a><pre>There was the soft sound of applause as Arisugawa Juri
strode out onto stage, her long orange hair flowing
over the shoulders of her midnight black suit. The
kareoke stage of the Locket had been modified for the
meeting, with a stand set up for any papers and a
somewhat more muted spotlight than usual. Joining her
on stage was Setsuna Meiou, the black haired woman
looking good dressed in a red gown, the green tint in
her hair shimmering in the light.

&quot;Good evening, friends and comrades,&quot; Arisugawa Juri
smiled at them all as she said with amusement, &quot;it&#39;s
come to my attention that we&#39;ve been honored to be
featured recently on the God awful fanfiction forums.&quot;

Setsuna frowned, &quot;I still don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re
taking it so well.&quot;

From the crowd they heard Nabiki Tendo call out
cheerfully, &quot;Hey, any publicity is good publicity.&quot;
She stood up from her seat with a grin, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t
believe the amount of visits we&#39;ve gotten out of it.&quot;

Juri nodded, &quot;That&#39;s pretty much my attitude.&quot; She saw
a hand waving in the crowd and called on her, &quot;Yes,
Mahoro?&quot;

Mahoro got up from her chair, her black and white
maid&#39;s uniform hugging her slim body. &quot;I still don&#39;t
understand why they thought I&#39;d object to working
here,&quot; she looked confused as she pushed her black
hair back. &quot;Lesbians and Gays are a perfectly natural
part of the population, not perverted at all.&quot;

&quot;Well they are critics,&quot; Sasami pointed out, the blue
haired princess smiling with amusement, &quot;they probably
weren&#39;t aware that psychiatrists haven&#39;t considered
Lesbians to be ill or perverted for years.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so hard to keep up these days,&quot; Minagi noted,
holding her lover&#39;s hand. The taller woman pushed her
wild mane hair back, her red bodysuit clinging as she
said dryly, &quot;It might have actually required
research.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be mean,&quot; Juri smiled.

&quot;I still think you&#39;re taking this too lightly,&quot;
Setsuna said to Juri softly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right, love,&quot; Juri smirked, &quot;if it helps
we&#39;re sending over our special negotiation team to
deal with this.&quot;

&quot;Special negotiation team?&quot; Alpha blinked in
confusion, the green haired android sitting up near
the front.

&quot;Yes, I got the volunteers together myself,&quot; Nabiki
sounded very satisfied with herself as she called out,
&quot;ladies?&quot;

From the shadows Excel Excel emerged first, then
Hyatt, both of them carrying large swords and grinning
evily; Ryouko was right beside them, the space pirate
dressed in black and red battle garb, her energy blade
ready and finally Mahoro rose from her seat, producing
her wicked looking alien killing pistol from under her
maid uniform skirt.

&quot;I think they&#39;ll be able to handle things nicely,&quot;
Juri smiled impishly.

&quot;We also got a few volunteers from customers,&quot; Ryouko
said, eyes glowing with anticipation, &quot;we&#39;ll pick up
Priss, Kirika and Mireille on the way over.&quot;

&quot;Remember, whatever you do don&#39;t get caught,&quot; Nabiki
cheerfully reminded them as they headed out, eager to
go to work.

&quot;All right,&quot; Setsuna sighed happily, &quot;I think that
should do nicely.&quot;

&quot;I thought so,&quot; Juri grinned. &quot;Lets see,&quot; she checked
her notes, &quot;any suggestions for a theme party on
Easter this year?&quot;

&quot;We could always do an Easter egg hunt?&quot; May
suggested.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Sasami mused, &quot;but what if we lose some of
the eggs? I don&#39;t want to be stumbling over them weeks
later.&quot;

&quot;Eww,&quot; Minagi made a face.

&quot;Bunnies went over well last year,&quot; Nabiki offered
diplomatically.

&quot;I think we&#39;ll go with bunnies,&quot; Juri agreed, &quot;but
costumes won&#39;t be compulsory. Also, keep whatever
you&#39;re wearing tasteful.&quot;

&quot;How do you define tasteful?&quot; Cybersix asked, the
black haired, leather clad woman standing in the rear
of the group.

&quot;Something you can walk down the street in and not be
arrested for public indecency,&quot; Juri chuckled softly.

&quot;Did something happen last year?&quot; Alpha asked
curiously.

&quot;Ryouko kind of misjudged how well she had stuck the
cups of her top on,&quot; Minagi whispered to her, &quot;and at
one point she moved too fast and.. pop!&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Alpha blushed.

&quot;Wait till you see one of our big Halloween parties,&quot;
Sasami whispered to her softly, &quot;it makes bunnies look
tame.&quot;

Juri tapped something on one of her sheets of paper,
&quot;And I understand we&#39;re hosting the next meeting of
the Android Girls and the Women who love them
society?&quot;

May nodded smiling, &quot;Yes, Juri-sama. Since several
girls who are members are already on staff it seemed
fitting.&quot;

&quot;Who else is going to be there?&quot; Keiko asked her lover
curiously, her long brown braid flowing down her back.

&quot;Well,&quot; May looked thoughtful as she remembered,
&quot;there&#39;s me, Alpha and Mahoro, I understand Nuku Nuku
and Emi are coming, Anna and Uni Puma, Miyu, Silvie
and Anri, and of course all their various partners.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Sasami blinked, &quot;do we need special snacks and
drinks?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give you the list,&quot; Keiko said.

&quot;Considering the nature of the members of the group
I&#39;d like you to try to keep local property damage to a
minimum,&quot; Juri reminded them.

&quot;Yes Juri,&quot; Alpha and May said together.

Juri looked around the room, &quot;Is there any other
business to discuss?&quot;

&quot;How did an alternate version of Mamoru get in here
recently?&quot; Hitomi asked curiously, her short brown
hair framing her face.

&quot;Washu-san?&quot; Juri directed the question to her.

The redheaded genius rose, her labcoat fluttering
around her childlike form. &quot;I think the Dimension
Tuner that allows the bar to exist across multiple
dimensions mistook him for a lesbian,&quot; Washu admitted.

&quot;Eh?&quot; everyone looked at Washu in surprise.

&quot;You have to admit that he isn&#39;t the most masculine
man,&quot; Washu reminded them, &quot;I think he might even be
one of the rare breed of male lesbians.&quot; Her eyes
glittered dangerously, &quot;Maybe I can lure him down to
my lab for further research.&quot;

Juri decided to just ignore that. &quot;All right
everyone,&quot; she said briskly, &quot;lets get back to work
and I hope you all have a good week.&quot;

&quot;Very inspiring,&quot; Setsuna murmured as the group
dispersed.

Juri shrugged, &quot;Nabiki suggested I toss that in.&quot; She
smiled at her lover as she asked, &quot;Do you want to
check schedules with Haruka and Michiru? I was
thinking of taking everyone out to dinner one night.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Setsuna looked surprised, &quot;but what&#39;s the
occasion?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just feeling a bit guilty that you&#39;re all letting
me skip my turn in cooking for everyone,&quot; Juri
admitted. She grinned suddenly, &quot;Though considering my
ineptness at cooking, it&#39;s probably a mercy to all
concerned.&quot;

&quot;I thought the time you made me breakfast in bed was
nice,&quot; Setsuna defended her.

Juri laughed, &quot;Considering it was cold cereal and
milk, it was kind of hard to mess that up.&quot;

Notes: There really is a thread on Arisugawa&#39;s Locket
in the Godawful fanfiction forum, which I found quite
amusing. They seem to have some issues with the
content, more than my writing, as well as having too
many non-canon lesbians appearing. Also, in the fic
&quot;Mamoru must die&quot; the Locket appeared and Mamoru went
into the bar, made a jerk of himself and was... dealt
with. Since most guys can&#39;t even enter the bar, I
thought I should touch on why he got in.</pre>
