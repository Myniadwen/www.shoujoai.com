&quot;You wanted to see me, Sir?&quot; Roy asked as he came into Gloval&#39;s office.

&quot;Yes, please sit down, Commander,&quot; Gloval said pleasantly. Roy took a 
seat in front of Gloval&#39;s desk. &quot;Now that you are finished convalescing 
from you injuries, I would like to discuss your future duties, if any, 
with you. Assuming you do not wish to leave the military, I have an 
offer to make to you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; Roy said, curious.

&quot;With your record, you would warrant a promotion and your own ship now,&quot; 
Gloval explained. &quot;However, we are not in a position to do this. What I 
can do is offer you the position of third officer here aboard the SDF-1. 
Right away this would mean you would be responsible for coordinating the 
Veritechs in battle. In the long term, you would be learning Lisa&#39;s job 
and slowly phase into her position as she becomes unable to perform her 
duties during the course of her pregnancy. She will of course be taking 
her duties back after she recovers from giving birth to her child.

&quot;During normal times you and Claudia would stand 2nd and 3rd watches on 
the bridge,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;You would also handle any air group matters 
that don&#39;t come under the purview of Commander Saotome-Hayes as the CAG. 
What do you think, Commander?&quot;

&quot;I think it sounds good,&quot; Roy said. &quot;A lot better than being an 
instructor.&quot;

&quot;Very well then, Commander,&quot; Gloval smiled broadly. &quot;Welcome to the ship 
side of the operation. I will instruct Lisa to begin training you 
immediately.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Over the next four months, Roy took gradually took over more and more of 
Lisa&#39;s bridge duties, allowing her more free time to deal with her 
swelling tummy. The whole bridge crew doted on her when she was on the 
bridge and Ranma had become extremely attentive to her as well.

Ranma, for her part was experiencing something strange. Kasumi surmised 
it was some sort of sympathetic hormonal reaction to Lisa&#39;s pregnancy, 
but Ranma was experiencing the side effects of being pregnant herself. 
She often had the same bizarre cravings as Lisa had and the most odd 
thing was that her breasts had begun to swell and ache. Kasumi said that 
her breasts were preparing to produce breast milk to nurse a child.

While Ranma was a little less than enthused about this, Lisa was 
thrilled. She teased Ranma relentlessly about their child never having 
to go hungry with an impressive set of mammery glands like Ranma 
sported. She also cited that if the child ate like Ranma, then it would 
need all four breasts to keep it satisfied. While everyone else thought 
this was hysterical, Ranma failed to find the humor in it most of the 
time, especially once her breasts began leaking during combat maneuvers 
and forced her to begin wearing pads.

Of course, the Roses all thought this was highly amusing in the locker 
room after a mission, as Ranma disgustedly had to change the sodden 
pads.

By the time Lisa was well into her 7th month, Minmei completed her 
training and joined the bridge crew as one of the Bridge Bunnies. Sammy, 
Kim, and Vanessa welcomed their new addition as it took some of the 
strain off them. Her primary bridge duties encompassed the modular 
transformation and coordinating the damaged control crews. Minmei was 
also made the primary liaison officer to Macross City.

In her off time, she continued her recording career, though it was now 
severely curtailed. In spite of this, her popularity with the people 
onboard the SDF-1 had soared with her announcement that she was joining 
the military. She had held several concerts, which also included a 
reluctant Ranma, setup by Lisa and Gloval under the heading of Morale 
Building. The fact was that Ranma was nearly as popular as Minmei, 
performing three or four &#39;cover&#39; songs during these concerts while 
Minmei sang back up for her.

Minmei hadn&#39;t seen much of Rick since she joined up, having been busy 
with training, but she had talked to him and their relationship had 
begun to improve. Her desire to be a part of his world had touched him 
and he began to open up to her more of late.

Shortly after Minmei joined the bridge crew, Roy took over all of Lisa&#39;s 
bridge duties as it had become difficult for her to move around easily 
and she had taken to handling most of her administrative duties from her 
bed with laptop. Ranma, also, had taken to handling much of her 
administrative duties as CAG from their quarters after Gloval &#39;strongly&#39; 
suggested it. However, she refused to allow herself to be taken out of 
the patrol rotation, in spite of assurances that she wasn&#39;t needed.

Fortunately, aside from the odd harassing probes, the Zentradi fleet was 
largely quiet. Most of the probing attacks were quickly beaten back and 
things calmed down again. Everyone hoped it would remain this way 
indefinitely, but they all knew it was a faint hope at best.

(oO\O/Oo)

December 2010...

&quot;RANMA!&quot; Lisa shrieked from the bedroom. &quot;My water just broke! It&#39;s 
time!&quot;

Lisa was forced to reassess the wisdom of shrieking such information, as 
for the next ten minutes all she saw was Ranma running past the bedroom 
door on a high speed circuit of the living room in a complete panic, 
screaming &quot;It&#39;s Time, what do I do?&quot; repetitively. Lisa would have 
laughed hysterically if the contractions hadn&#39;t begun.

She gingerly levered herself out of bed and collected the suitcase that 
had been set aside for just this event. She awkwardly made her way to 
the door and waited until Ranma came by on her next circuit. Lisa thrust 
the suitcase out at head level and Ranma&#39;s face smacked into it. The 
redhead&#39;s feet ran out from under her and she remained suspended in the 
air for a couple of heartbeats before slamming to the floor flat on her 
back.

&quot;Ranma, honey, take this and meet me at the jeep,&quot; Lisa said sweetly, 
dropping the suitcase on the prone redhead&#39;s belly before heading to the 
door and the jeep that was stationed outside it.

Ranma grunted as the suitcase impacted her stomach, but she was 
immediately up and running to the door, beating the awkwardly moving 
Lisa to it and assisting her out of the cabin and into the jeep. Leaping 
behind the wheel, Ranma floored the accelerator and they charged off 
toward the hospital at a suicidal speed.

&quot;Ranma, sweetie,&quot; Lisa said calmly, &quot;I&#39;d like to make it to the hospital 
alive, please.&quot; Ranma nodded and sped up. &quot;Ranma, sweetie, THAT MEANS 
SLOW THE FUCK DOWN!&quot; Ranma slowed down, looking very sheepish. &quot;Thank 
you, honey, you&#39;re so sweet.&quot;

While Ranma concentrated on getting them to the hospital, Lisa called 
ahead and let them know to expect them and to inform Dr. Tendo and Nurse 
Saotome they were on their way. Ranma and Lisa had quickly made Kasumi 
their primary doctor when she arrived, both for her evident competence 
and the fact that she was familiar with Ranma&#39;s condition.

Nine hours later found the couple in the delivery room, Lisa laying on 
the table with her legs spread wide in the stirrups and looking quite 
bedraggled. Her hair was soaked with sweat and her face was a mask of 
pain.

&quot;Lisa, Honey, I need you to push,&quot; Kasumi said again.

Lisa squeezed Ranma&#39;s hand hard enough to crush granite and screamed as 
she pushed again. She relaxed, gasping for air as she steeled herself 
for the next effort.

&quot;Ranma!&quot; she growled at her wife.

&quot;Yeah, love?&quot; Ranma said, blotting the sweat off her face.

&quot;You&#39;re having the NEXT ONE!&quot; she screamed as she pushed again.

Ranma looked at Lisa with her eyes widened in fear, as she took in the 
fierce grimace of pain on Lisa&#39;s face and her overall state of 
exhaustion, and promptly fainted with a loud thump.

Nodoka looked around from her position over Kasumi&#39;s shoulder and 
grinned at her daughter&#39;s fate.

&quot;Okay, Honey, I can see the head,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;You&#39;re almost there. 
Give me one more big push.&quot;

Lisa screamed again and pushed with all her waning strength.

&quot;Good Job!&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;You&#39;re done!&quot; Lisa collapsed back on the 
delivery table breathing heavily while Kasumi cleaned the baby up and 
determined the sex. Glancing at Ranma&#39;s unconscious form, Kasumi smiled 
and said, &quot;Oh my, I guess she doesn&#39;t want to cut the umbilical then. 
Mrs. Saotome-Hayes, you are the proud mothers of a beautiful baby boy!&quot;

Kasumi handed the baby to Nodoka to be washed and wrapped while she 
cleaned up some. As this was happening Ranma began to come around.

&quot;Ranma,&quot; Lisa said with a tired but happy smile. &quot;We&#39;re parents. We have 
a son.&quot;

Ranma smiled brightly as she stood back up, and kissed Lisa tenderly. 
Nodoka brought the baby over and handed him to Lisa so that she could 
get her first look at her child. Seeing Lisa tenderly hold their baby 
and the look of pure adoration in her green eyes, Ranma felt 
overwhelmed. Tears ran down her face as she felt an intense burning love 
for both her wife and child well up within her.

&quot;Have you decided on a name?&quot; Nodoka asked, tears running down her own 
face as she watched the tender moment between her daughters and 
grandson.

&quot;We chose the name Yoshima,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Free Horse, son of the Wild Horse,&quot; Nodoka smiled. &quot;It&#39;s a fine name.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

The day that Lisa and Yoshima were released from the hospital, Kasumi 
lost her nurse. Nodoka turned in her resignation in favor of being a 
fulltime grandmother/nanny. They had talked about it and decided that 
this would work out best because of Ranma&#39;s and Lisa&#39;s duties and the 
uncertainty of their schedules, possibly being called to GQ at any given 
moment. This way, Nodoka would always be there to take care of Yoshima 
if they were suddenly called to action.

Ranma was able to breastfeed the baby, and for some odd reason, Yoshima 
seemed to prefer Ranma&#39;s breasts to Lisa&#39;s. Instead of being offended by 
this, Lisa found it highly amusing. She teased Ranma about their son 
preferring Ranma to her because of the size of the meal. Ranma found it 
hard to be irritated as her infant son suckled on her nipples greedily. 
Quite the opposite, she was proud that she could provide for him in this 
way.

Not that little Yoshima turned his nose up at Lisa&#39;s breast when 
offered, but he seemed to be happier feeding with Ranma. The joke 
between them was that when Yoshima fed from Lisa it was a just a snack, 
while when feeding from Ranma it was a full meal.

Thankfully, because of the excess of space aboard the SDF-1, 
construction crews had been able to add two rooms to Ranma and Lisa&#39;s 
quarters a couple of months before the delivery. One was the nursery, 
while the other was now Nodoka&#39;s room.

(oO\O/Oo)

January 2011...

Toward the fifth week after Yoshima&#39;s birth, Lisa began to get around a 
little better and Nodoka insisted that Ranma and Lisa go see Minmei&#39;s 
movie that was debuting. Lisa thought it sounded nice so they decided to 
go.

They were surprised at the turnout. It seemed like everyone was there to 
see the film. While they were standing in line to get in, Ranma was 
forced to take a double take.

There, standing about ten feet behind them in line was Bertha Stott, in 
full Dominatrix persona. The auburn haired woman, already tall, towered 
above most of the people in the line by virtue of her 6-inch, 
spike-heeled, black patent leather, thigh-high boots, polished to a high 
gloss. A brief expanse of black fishnet stockings, the lace tops of 
which could just be seen when she took a step, disappeared under a very 
tight, black leather mini-skirt. A black leather corset finished out the 
outfit. But it wasn&#39;t this that drew the most attention.

In her right hand was a riding crop. In her left was the end of a leash. 
On the other end of the leash was Lynn Kyle, crawling around on his 
hands and knees wearing a black leather harness and a pair of black 
leather shorts. Ranma had to use every ounce of her will power not to 
fall on the ground laughing at the unusual sight. She nudged Lisa and 
gestured with her head in that direction. Lisa&#39;s eyes got huge and her 
hand came up over her mouth as she tried to stifle a laugh.

&quot;Let&#39;s go check this out,&quot; Ranma said, her eyes sparkling with 
amusement.

&quot;Let&#39;s,&quot; Lisa agreed with her own smile.

They moved back in the line toward Bertha. As the neared, Kyle caught 
sight of Ranma and leaped toward her, growling, only to be brought up 
short by the leash. He strained at the restraint trying to get at Ranma 
while growling.

Suddenly there was a whizzing sound cutting through the air. Bertha 
swung the riding crop in a vicious arc that ended in a loud smack 
between Kyle&#39;s legs. Ranma swore, from the way Kyle&#39;s eyes bugged when 
the crop connected, that his balls were trying to force themselves out 
of their sockets. Kyle let out a loud yelp that sounded just like a dog 
and scrambled back to Bertha. When he reached her, he began to lick the 
toes of her boots, much like a dog would when trying to placate an owner 
that had been angered.

&quot;Forgive my dog, Lady Ranma,&quot; Bertha said imperiously. &quot;He can be so 
ill-mannered sometimes. And he had been so well behaved lately, I 
thought I&#39;d take him out for a walk and to see the new movie. Rest 
assured he will be punished for his effrontery.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Lady Bertha,&quot; Ranma grinned. &quot;So how are you enjoying your 
new pet?&quot;

&quot;His training has been quite amusing,&quot; Bertha said in a regal tone. 
&quot;Although his sub-par intelligence has given rise to many an occasions 
to discipline him.&quot;

At that moment, a large stir was caused with the arrival of the stars of 
the movie, Minmei and a Korean man with the unlikely name of Kai Pao 
Wei. Ranma had worked with them both on the movie as they had hired her 
as a martial arts consultant. Kai was a reasonable martial artist and in 
Ranma&#39;s opinion had been a great choice for the movie. Far better than 
Bertha&#39;s dog had been.

After the stars had entered the theater, they began to let the crowds 
in. Ranma and Lisa waved good-bye to Bertha and her dog as they went to 
their seats.

(oO\O/Oo)

The movie, a martial arts extravaganza entitled &quot;Small White Dragon&quot;, 
portrayed a young powerful martial artist (Kai Pao Wei) who had to fight 
off an army to save the woman he loved (Minmei) from an evil Chinese 
warlord, using extreme martial arts moves that appeared to be fanciful 
to most everyone but Ranma and a few others. Even the ki blasts, Ranma 
knew were possible, although she hadn&#39;t yet figured out how to do one. 
She was certain that she could eventually.

To one group, however, the film was horrifying. The Zentradi which were 
monitoring the signal from the SDF-1, watched the Micronian take out 
hundreds of warriors, even a group of Zentradi-sized fighters with hand 
to hand combat techniques and shocking energy projection techniques 
performed with no weapons.

They had no idea that this was a fictional story and that most 
Micronians didn&#39;t believe in such techniques, let alone perform them. 
The Zentradi believed this to be some form of battle record and believed 
it to be factual. This was particularly understandable when one 
considered that they had seen Ranma stop Dolza&#39;s fist from crushing him.

A gravely concerned, Breetai took this &quot;battle record&quot; and the recording 
of the SDF-1&#39;s barrier overload that had wiped out an entire population 
center to destroy four Zentradi destroyers, which they had no idea was 
completely accidental, and went to brief Dolza.

While this was happening, the three spies were detailing their stay 
aboard the SDF-1 to their comrades. They told of the wondrous sights 
they had seen, and the things they had heard, and even their strangely 
compelling sessions with Mistress Bertha whom they had served to earn a 
living aboard the SDF-1.

Also featured in their tale were the two Micronian females, called 
Minmei and Ranma Saotome-Hayes, who did what the Micronians called 
singing. This singing was unlike anything the Zentradi had ever heard 
and the three former spies let their comrades listen to reproductions of 
it. The Zentradi were riveted by the strange, but pleasing sounds, which 
made them feel things they had never felt before. Soon, stories of the 
wonderful Micronian way of life spread like a virus through the entire 
Zentradi task force and there began to be talk of defection to the 
SDF-1.

Dolza, having reviewed Breetai&#39;s report, developed a multi-phased plan. 
The first phase required the capture and scientifically study of the 
Micronians to attempt to discover how they used Protoculture. The next 
phase was much more final. It called for the eradication of the 
Micronians as Dolza believed, quite accurately as it happened, that 
prolonged exposure to the race would contaminate the Zentradi.

As the Zentradi fleet awaited its directive, still a third plot was 
being hatched. This time by Kyron. Kyron planned to wait for the 
opportunity when he could act without Breetai&#39;s knowledge. He would 
seize this opportunity to destroy the Micronians that had repeatedly 
humiliated him once and for all. Especially that damnable &#39;Dragon Lady&#39;.

(oO\O/Oo)

March 2011...

&quot;Commander Grant, I&#39;ve detected an incoming Zentradi attack force,&quot; 
Vanessa said urgently. &quot;It looks like a big one.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Claudia said, keying the PA. &quot;General Quarters, General 
Quarters, all hands to battle stations! Civilians should move to 
shelters and prepare for Modular Transformation!&quot;

Gloval and Roy ran onto the bridge, followed soon after by Lisa and 
Minmei. Vanessa informed them that they had a force of about thirty 
Zentradi ships coming in on attack vectors.

&quot;Scramble the fighters,&quot; Gloval ordered. &quot;Transform the ship.&quot;

&quot;Commander Fokker, deploy the Veritech Squadrons,&quot; Lisa commanded. 
&quot;Ensign Lynn, start the countdown for Modular Transformation.&quot;

&quot;Veritechs deployed and engaging Zentradi fighter screen, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Roy 
announced.

&quot;Commencing modular transformation,&quot; Minmei said a moment later.

The mighty battle fortress began to move and shift as it reconfigured 
itself.

&quot;Captain!&quot; Vanessa gasped. &quot;The large enemy vessel appears to be on a 
collision course with us and isn&#39;t slowing down.&quot;

&quot;Hard astern, Cluadia,&quot; Gloval ordered.

&quot;We can&#39;t, Sir,&quot; Vanessa said. &quot;The enemy has us surrounded!&quot;

&quot;Very well, we have no choice then,&quot; Gloval growled. &quot;Lisa, prepare for 
the Daedalus Maneuver.&quot;

&quot;Preparing for the Daedalus Maneuver,&quot; Lisa confirmed. &quot;Kim, direct the 
destroids to the bow of the Daedalus and engage the pin-point barrier 
system.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Kim acknowledge.

As the huge Zentradi ship reached the position, Lisa ordered the 
Daedalus Maneuver to begin.

(oO\O/Oo)

When the Daedalus punched through the nose of the Zentradi ship and 
dropped its boarding ramp, the Zentradi sprung their trap. The destroids 
gathered in the bow of the Daedalus were met with withering fire and 
were destroyed before they ever fired a shot. Zentradi battle pods 
quickly ran up the ramp and were aboard the SDF-1 before anyone knew 
what was happening.

They charged through the corridors, taking out internal security forces 
and leaving destruction in their wake. Unnoticed, a small group of pods 
broke off from the main force. The invaders reached Macross City and 
began to beat back the civil defense forces. Soon it was clear that the 
defenders were being overrun.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Wild Rose and Skull Squadrons,&quot; Roy&#39;s voice came over the Tac-net, 
&quot;Zentradi have boarded the ship and are destroying Macross City. We need 
you in here to shore up the civil defense. Proceed to access 
Delta-oh-niner.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Gunsight 2,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Okay, Ladies and Gentlemen, you 
heard&#39;em. Lets get in there and kick those interlopers off our ship!&quot;

Ranma led Akane and Max into the specified access point, followed by the 
other Wild Rose flights and Skull Squadron. Unfortunately, a Zentradi 
officer&#39;s pod leading an attack force also managed to slip in behind 
them before the doors closed.

Ranma entered Macross City to see a scene of devastation. Fires burned 
and many buildings were little more than piles of rubble. She shifted to 
battloid mode and started down the streets, directing her team to spread 
out and begin a sweep for invaders.

A group of battle pods leapt out in front of her and Ranma opened up on 
them with her gun. They fell quickly, smoking holes littering their 
chassis&#39;. More battle pods rushed her and met a similar fate as Ranma 
stalked through the streets.

As she approached an intersection, a large group of battle pods rushed 
by at high speed heading down the cross street. One blew up as it was 
hit with an energy blast. The source of the blast soon appeared. It was 
a Zentradi officer&#39;s pod, firing on its own people. Ranma targeted the 
pod and fired a burst of high velocity armor piercing slugs into the 
side of it, knocking the pod over.

As it stood back up, Ranma&#39;s comm screen lit up.

&quot;You!&quot; said the snide sounding Zentradi that had identified himself as 
Kyron sneered.

&quot;Hey, Blue Boy,&quot; Ranma greeted. &quot;I guess you felt the need for another 
smack down, huh?&quot;

&quot;You will not defeat me!&quot; Kyron shrieked.

He launched a spread of missiles at Ranma. Ranma used her head lasers 
and her cannon to take out five of the six and, in an incredible display 
of piloting, grabbed the other one out of the air and flung it back at 
Kyron like an oversized explosive shuriken. Kyron tried to evade but 
again his heavy beam cannon was struck and blasted off by his own 
missile.

The explosion knocked Kyron into a building. Ranma fired another burst 
from her cannon and blasted away one of Kyron&#39;s arms. She charged down 
the street as Kyron struggled to extract himself from the rubble of the 
building. Just as he managed to regain his feet, Ranma fired her lasers 
into the knee of Kyron&#39;s pod, fusing it solid. Kyron returned fire with 
his remaining arm mounted weapons, which Ranma evaded readily. Another 
burst from Ranma&#39;s cannon and the weapon pod on the remaining arm 
exploded.

Unarmed, Kyron tried to escape by firing his thrusters.

&quot;Uh uh uh,&quot; Ranma chided as she grabbed the fused leg and slammed the 
damaged pod into the ground. She used her lasers to destroy the pods 
main thrusters. &quot;You&#39;re not getting away this time, Blue Boy,&quot; Ranma 
said.

The hatch popped open on the pod and Kyron crawled out. He took his 
helmet off and threw it on the ground in frustration.

&quot;Damn you!&quot; Kyron yelled at Ranma. &quot;I will not be defeated again!&quot;

Kyron charged Ranma, knocking her gun out of her hands and attempting a 
spinning back-fist to her head. Ranma ducked the fist and planted a 
two-fisted hammer blow to Kyron&#39;s ribs, knocking him across the street 
into a building. Kyron pulled himself out of the building and charged in 
rage again...right into the hay-maker Ranma had launched.

Kyron flew back about twenty meters and landed on his back, unconscious. 
Ranma picked up her gun and walked up to Kyron. Seeing he was out cold, 
she smirked wickedly while thinking about what to do to make sure he was 
manageable. Grimacing, she raised her gun and shot him in the knee.

The pain immediately awoke the Zentradi warlord as he sat up screaming 
and clutching his knee. Ranma kicked him in the head and put him out 
again.

(oO\O/Oo)

Unknown to Ranma, she had an audience.

&quot;Magnificent,&quot; Miriya said in awe, from her vantage point behind some 
rubble. &quot;Truly a skilled and ruthless warrior, this Dragon Lady.&quot; She 
had since learned to read the Micronian language and knew from the large 
&#39;1&#39; on the Micronian mecha that this was the one Kyron had told her 
about.

She turned her attention to her true quarry, the one she had come to 
kill, who was having his own battle down the cross street. This warrior, 
too, was magnificent, though not so graceful as his commander. She 
watched as he danced through a group of battle pods that had rushed him. 
He emerged on the other side, and as the pods started to turn toward him 
again, they began exploding.

&quot;These Micronians are truly great warriors,&quot; Miriya said in wondrous 
admiration. &quot;But I will find you and kill you Wild Rose 4. I will have 
my revenge.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;So what should we do with them?&quot; Roy asked, glancing at the three 
former spies.

&quot;I say we should grant their request for political asylum,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;We can&#39;t do that without approval from the UNEDC,&quot; Maistroff protested. 
&quot;We can&#39;t trust them. They are aliens.&quot;

&quot;Who the hell cares what the UNEDC says?&quot; Ranma snarled. &quot;They banished 
us and the whole civilian population of Macross City from Earth. I say 
that means we make our own decisions.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Maistroff screeched. &quot;That...that&#39;s treason!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s treason is sending thousands of innocent civilians into harm&#39;s 
way just because you don&#39;t want to get caught in your own lies,&quot; Ranma 
snapped.

&quot;Commander Saotome-Hayes has a point,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;While I feel our 
loyalty to Earth remains, I no longer feel that this ship owes any 
loyalty to the UNEDC. They have cut us adrift and chased us off the 
Earth under threat of attack. They no longer have any say on how we 
conduct ourselves aboard this ship.&quot;

&quot;I agree,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Having talked to the defectors, I think we have a 
shot at a peaceful end to this war.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious,&quot; Maistroff said in dismay.

&quot;I am gravely serious about this,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;The United Earth 
Government has cast us out to die in an attempt to buy themselves some 
time that will not help them. All the Zentradi want is this ship. We 
have a responsibility to all the people aboard this ship to do 
everything in our power to ensure their safety. And this we will do.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s our job to fight and die to defend Earth!&quot; Maistroff said. 
&quot;Everyone knew that was a risk when the signed on!&quot;

&quot;BULLSHIT!&quot; Ranma roared. &quot;What about the 50,000 civilians that got 
dragged into this against their will, you stupid, boot-licking jackass? 
They didn&#39;t sign on for anything. They have just as much right to be 
protected as anyone on Earth does. And since the honorless pricks in 
charge would rather them die than admit they lied, it&#39;s up to us to 
ensure their safety.&quot;

&quot;How dare you speak to me this way!&quot; Maistroff shrieked. &quot;That&#39;s it! 
I&#39;ve heard enough of this seditious idiocy!&quot; Maistroff pulled his 
sidearm and pointed it at Gloval. &quot;Captain Henry Gloval, I am hereby 
relieving you of command. Lt. Colonel Mayo, take the Captain and anyone 
who resists into custody.&quot; Mayo also pulled his sidearm.

&quot;Just what in the fuck do you think you&#39;re doing, you fucking mutinous 
slime?&quot; Ranma growled. &quot;Put those sidearms away before I shove them up 
your fucking asses. Do you honestly expect anyone to listen to a 
butt-sucking toady like you?&quot;

The Zentradi and the MP&#39;s that guarded them watched all this in utter 
shock.

&quot;That&#39;s enough out of you, Commander,&quot; Maistroff snapped. &quot;You&#39;re mouth 
just bought you an extended stay in the brig.&quot;

Nobody was sure what happened, but suddenly, Maistroff&#39;s gun went flying 
across the room and he was screaming and cradling his broken wrist as 
Ranma stood in front of him. Mayo swung his sidearm to fire on Ranma, 
but Ranma delivered a thrust kick to Maistroff&#39;s chest knocking him into 
Mayo. Mayo&#39;s gun went off and the bullet struck the headrest of the 
chair right beside Lisa&#39;s head.

Ranma slowly looked at how close the bullet had come to ending Lisa&#39;s 
life and then looked back at Mayo. Her eyes flashed with a cold ice-blue 
light and her battle aura exploded from her, wreathing her in blindingly 
bright blue flames of righteous fury.

&quot;You&#39;re a fucking dead man,&quot; Ranma ground out through her fury as she 
glared at Mayo.

Suddenly, she appeared in front of the man and his gun was in her hand. 
With one hand, she crushed it to twisted metal and powered polymer. Mayo 
peed his pants and whimpered. That&#39;s all he got out before Ranma buried 
her fist in his guts and then delivered a spinning back-kick to his 
chest. Mayo flew across the room and slammed into the steel bulkhead 
with a sickening crunch.

The three Zentradi huddled on the ground jabbering in abject terror. 
They had never seen such a display of horrifying power before. It 
frightened them to the core in spite of being battle-hardened veterans. 
This beautiful Micronian redhead instilled more fear and terror in them 
than both Breetai and Dolza put together.

Ranma began to slowly stalk toward him, the flames of her battle aura 
flowing and guttering around her. She was going to kill this asshole 
painfully.

&quot;Ranma STOP!&quot; Lisa&#39;s voice cut through her rage. &quot;Ranma, please don&#39;t 
kill him. He&#39;s not worth it. I&#39;m okay. Please.&quot;

Ranma slowly looked over to Lisa, who came around the table and 
approached her.

&quot;Please, Honey,&quot; Lisa begged. &quot;I&#39;m safe. We&#39;re all safe. He can&#39;t hurt 
anyone now. Look at him.&quot;

Ranma swung her gaze back to Mayo who was lying in an unconscious 
crumpled heap at the base of the wall, blood leaking out his mouth. The 
bright blue aura flickered and guttered out. Lisa hugged the redhead.

&quot;Get these men some medical attention,&quot; Gloval ordered the MP&#39;s in the 
room. &quot;And put them under arrest on the charge of mutiny.&quot;
