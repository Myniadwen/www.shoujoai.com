<h1>Revolutionary Girl Sakura (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The brown haired girl climbed out of her bed, the moonlight streaming 
in from the nearby window. &#39;There goes another night&#39;s rest,&#39; Sakura 
thought wryly. &#39;Thank god a seventeen year old doesn&#39;t need much 
sleep.&#39; The tall, lanky girl pulled on her boy&#39;s uniform and hurried 
out the door. She followed her instincts, letting them guide her until 
she reached the haunted forest just behind the school.

The green haired man stepped from the shadows, and smiled darkly. She 
gazed up at him calmly, unsurprised. &quot;So, little card captor,&quot; he said 
coldly, &quot;you&#39;ve come to capture me?&quot;

&quot;Surrender the card,&quot; she said calmly. &quot;We don&#39;t need to fight...&quot; 
Sakura began, only to stop as he harshly laughed. He gestured, and 
another figure, a girl, stepped out, bearing two roses.

She placed a green rose in his lapel, then rather offhandedly put a 
white one on Sakura. &quot;Who are you?&quot; Sakura asked softly.

The girl gave her a jealous glare. &quot;Shinohara Wakaba.&quot; She walked over 
and placed a kiss on the taller boy&#39;s cheek, &quot;For luck, Saionji.&quot;

Sakura felt the presence before she saw her, as soft lips touched her 
cheek. A very familiar voice said, &quot;For luck, Sakura.&quot; She very slowly 
turned, only to see her pretty, dark haired roommate, Daidouji Tomoyo 
standing beside her. She shrugged, smiling at Sakura&#39;s questioning 
gaze. &quot;I wondered why my roommate was sneaking out at night all the 
time...&quot;

Sakura shook her head, deciding to ask questions later. She reached 
into her top, and pulled out the gleaming sword necklace. Sakura spoke 
softly, growing louder as she continued:

&quot;Oh Sword of Dios,

Power of magic, power of Right!

Surrender the Blade, the sword of Light!

Release!&quot;

As soon as the shining blade fully appeared in Sakura&#39;s hand, Saionji 
charged! He tried to catch her off guard, but she dodged him easily. 
They twisted and turned, jumping and leaping about in the small 
clearing, he attacking, her replying, until she finally saw an 
opening. She lunged, her blade slicing across the rose on his chest, 
and it&#39;s petals blew away from them in the cool night breeze.

Wakaba cried out in alarm, then suddenly, the shadows that enfolded 
him burst free of his body and swept towards Sakura. &quot;Shadow Card! 
Return to your power confined! Shadow!&quot; she cried, stabbing the moving 
shadows in midair. It writhed at the end of her blade, then reformed 
as a card, dropping into her hands.

Saionji wavered, then dropped into Wakaba&#39;s arms. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; 
he asked, dazed. &quot;How did I get here?&quot;

Sakura smiled, helping Wakaba pick him up. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, everything&#39;s 
going to be all right.&quot;


Sakura looked at her cheerful roommate across the breakfast table. 
Tomoyo dished up Sakura&#39;s meal, then her own, and sat down, still 
smiling. &quot;So where did you get that sword thing? And how long have you 
been catching those cards?&quot; Tomoyo asked.

&quot;I&#39;ve had the sword for a long time,&quot; Sakura said softly. &quot; &#39;We will 
meet again.&#39; was what the woman said to me, after she pulled me up and 
out of the river. She held me in her arms, so gently, and I smelled 
roses and cherry blossoms in her long, brown hair. My fingers tangled 
in her necklace, and it came free. She smiled down at me sadly, and I 
felt all floaty inside.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Tomoyo said quietly. &quot;It&#39;s almost like a fairy tale.&quot;

Sakura nodded. &quot;About the same time each year I&#39;d receive a postcard, 
with that very same scent. All of them said the same thing: &#39;I will 
see you soon.&#39; About two years ago, the card had a set of directions, 
that I followed to a bookstore. The young man at the counter gave me a 
book, but when I went back to the same place later, he and the store 
were gone.&quot;

Sakura reached into her bookbag beside her and placed a large tome on 
the table. It was finely detailed, and Tomoyo turned it over in her 
hands with an awed expression on her face. Something rattled inside, 
and with Sakura&#39;s nod, she opened it. The book was actually a box 
containing a large stack of cards, a pen that looked sort of 
sword-like, and a note.

The note read &#39;The cards freed from this book will bring great evil in 
the world unless they are captured and placed within. The sword is the 
key. Please capture them, so that you and I can meet once again.&#39; 
Written below the letter was the chant that Sakura had used in battle. 
Tomoyo gently lifted the note out, raised it to her face and smelled 
cherry blossoms and roses.

Tomoyo turned the book over again, and looked at the front and back 
patterns on the book. &quot;There&#39;s something... missing, isn&#39;t there?&quot; she 
asked, frowning.

Sakura nodded, excited. &quot;I noticed that too, Maybe something was 
supposed to help watch over the cards, too.&quot; Sakura shook her head, 
getting back to her story. &quot;Anyway, last year, I received a post card 
saying &#39;We will meet.&#39; After a bit of panic, I realized all the photos 
on the postcards fit together, forming an image of the main buildings 
of Ohtori academy. So, here I am.&quot;

&quot;Would you mind,&quot; Tomoyo said tentatively, &quot;if I come along on your 
captures? How many cards are left, anyway?&quot;

&quot;The cards hide inside of people, and the people use the card&#39;s powers 
to cause evil. I fight them in the duels, and when they lose the power 
leaves them and returns to their card forms,&quot; Sakura said softly. 
&quot;There&#39;s only a few left, but I should warn you that the captures can 
be kind of dangerous.&quot;

Tomoyo suddenly whipped out a video camera. &quot;Even better!&quot; she said 
happily. Sakura sweatdropped.

------------------------------------------------------------

As the two girls walked to classes, high above them in one of the 
windows of the observatory, a figure watched. &quot;So, how did it go last 
night, Kerberos?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Just fine!&quot; Kero answered, nodding. &quot;She captured Shadow easily 
enough. I think she&#39;s getting better at the swordsmanship stuff, too.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; the woman answered quietly. &quot;But I hope she won&#39;t need 
it.&quot;

&quot;I like her as well,&quot; a aristocratic voice from the doorway said 
quietly, &quot;but to be protector of the cards, she must prove herself 
worthy.&quot; The white haired boy walked into the room casually, his blue 
robe swirled around him, and he tucked his wings in behind him. &quot;Do 
you think she&#39;ll be ready?&quot; Yue asked.

Kaho Mitsuki looked fondly down at the two girls walking below. &quot;Oh, I 
hope so.&quot; she said quietly. </pre>
