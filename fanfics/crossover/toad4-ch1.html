<h2> Darkness Falls</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The light…</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  Memories…   Ying-Ying lying on the ground in a pool of blood, her throat cut.  The feel of a hand ripping her clothes open  as she lay paralyzed from the poison of the dart in her neck.  A shadowy figure above her holding a  knife.  Tears as she felt herself  violated.  Despair as she was turned  over, her hair jerked savagely as a bowl was placed under her and her throat  was cut as well. Then only fading sight..</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  The light coursed through her, turning her blood to  fire</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  “You will marry Sung Li, niece, and I will hear no  more about it.”</p><p>
  A wedding, her sad face as the ceremony was completed,  and she was taken away by Li.  Her cries  of pain as he forced himself on her over and over.  Her shame as she hid her bruised and  blackened face from the village.  Fear as  she felt an iron collar around her neck as she stood naked on an auction  block.  Hatred as she looked upon a  serene porcelain mask with red slashes descending from dark eyesockets.  Pain unbearable as the blade pierced her  heart…</p><p>
  <em>Flicker</em>.</p><p>
  The light burned within her, a brightness so intense  it was beyond sight…</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  Tears.  The body  of Rei burned and broken in her arms, her Sailor uniform charred as a dark  figure stood over them, laughing.</p><p>
  &lt;&lt;<em>such a  foolish girl, as if mere love could stand against chaos.  and now, you are oh so alone</em>.&gt;&gt;</p><p>
  A hand made of midnight  touched her cheek, and lifted her tear streaked face to meet a non-existent  face.</p><p>
  &lt;&lt;<em>and now,  you are mine.&gt;&gt;</em></p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  The light sang…</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  “So my little playtoy, you have decided to rebel?  But where will you go?  Who will shelter you?  So many dead by your hand.  So much destruction.  Even your darling Ukyo.  You <em>do</em> remember Ukyo… how you tortured her, how you savored her pain, how you made her  pay for turning her back on you, for failing to save you?”</p><p>
  She gasped for breath on the floor as the figure in  the baboon cloak circled her, his hand caressing a beating heart… her heart… as  she struggled to rise.</p><p>
  “Ah yes, and what about that priestess you loved as  well.  You beheaded her if I recall…  after she tried to kill you.  So many  sins, my little mouse.”</p><p>
  “You… you were controlling me, you bastard!”</p><p>
  Dark laughter came from the figure as he knelt, a  taloned hand caressing her cheek before it fell and gripped her throat.  “Controlling you?  T’was it not the darkness in your own soul  which corrupted the Shikon shard I gave you?   The anger and despair you hid so deep inside?  I may have used you, but I did not give rise  to the lust which made you rape Ukyo.”</p><p>
  His hand clenched around her heart.  “No, Zhu Shu.   It is far too late to repent.”   The fingers at her throat burned as she felt them burrow into her  neck.  “But I do thank you for slaying Kikyou  and Inuyasha. Now it is time for you to become a part of me. The power of your  black dragon blood will come in handy when I invade China and slay this upstart wizard  who has dared challenge me…”</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  The light was singing a song of power beyond power.</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  Death.   Pain.  Destruction.  Memories of lifetimes spent.  Memories of failure.  Memories of loss.</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  The light was tearing her apart…</p><p>
  <em>Flicker.</em></p><p>
  She screamed her denial with her soul and she felt  something within well up and tear.  For a  flickering second she heard the ringing crystal music within the light and  looked upon the face of infinity, and knew she was lost…</p><p>
  Then she felt a hand touch her cheek, and cool metal  brushed against her ears as she beheld a shining kindly face that smiled at her  as he gazed at her with a single azure blue eye… </p><p>
  Then the light  was fading, and she fled into the merciful darkness.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Urd picked herself up off the floor and looked around  to see Mara struggling to sit up.  Across  the dance floor Ke Lun was helping Belldandy to sit, while a bunny eared Lo  Shen was rubbing her temples and looking dazed.</p><p>
  “Wot hoppen.” she managed to say in a slurred voice.</p><p>
  Skuld crawled out from under a table, shaking her head  as she looked into what appeared to be a compact.  “Some… some sort of backlash.  I’m getting a reading like a wish  transmittal, but on its heels was some kind of massive power surge of a  magnitude I’ve never seen.  It was like a  seal was broken on someone with a lot more power than any of us could wield  even if we all worked together.”</p><p>
  Belldandy waved vaguely in the direction of Nabiki’s  office.  “I think it came from that  way.”  </p><p>
  The buzz of conversation started up again as the  revelers realized the sudden collapse of the goddesses and Lo Shen might have  been dramatic but didn’t seem serious, at least to them.   Urd managed to stand, though a bit  unsteadily, and headed towards the office, only to be met by the Senshi and  Akane.</p><p>
  “Nabiki?  Zhu  Shu?”  Akane knocked on the door again as  Urd blinked at the five girls.</p><p>
  “Did you feel it too?”</p><p>
  Akane looked at the white haired goddess, remembering  that Shan Pu had pointed her out.   “You’re Urd, right?  I… Um… We  felt something weird just now from in there.   I don’t know what it was but it made me pass out for a minute.”</p><p>
  Urd nodded.   “Yeah, open the door.”</p><p>
  “It’s locked.”</p><p>
  Belldandy had arrived and murmured at the door, which  creaked open.  Akane beat Urd inside.</p><p>
  “Huh?  It’s  empty?”</p><p>
  A moan came from behind the desk, and Urd stepped  around it quickly.  “What the hell?  Peorth?”</p><p>
  Belldandy knelt beside the unconscious goddess.  “She’s in shock I think.”</p><p>
  “But where is everyone else?”  Akane asked.</p><p>
  “Yeah, Rei and Zhu-chan and Ukyo all came in here to  see Tao-Ching give that sword to the old guy who just got here.” Usagi chimed  in.  “And I think that Samurai guy was in  here too.”</p><p>
  “My readings show that there were seven people in this  room just prior to the wish transmittal,” Skuld confirmed.  “Now there’s a massive temporal flux and  traces of that surge, but I couldn’t tell you what made it.  I’d need a remote to Yggy for more detail.”</p><p>
  Mara had poked her head in.  “So what happened?”  She blinked. “And what is Peorth doing here?”</p><p>
  Urd looked at the unconscious Goddess.  “That is what I intend to find out.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The storm broke over Muhashi domain without warning,  forming impossibly fast in a clear sky.   In a small village a few miles outside of Edo,  a miko raced to the village watchtower and looked toward the heart of the  disturbance.  Miles away, a massive  column of light pulsed, each flicker growing weaker as the clouds above spread  further from the center.  Lightning  crackled as rain began falling in sheets, obscuring the distant light.</p><p>
  The village elder had made it to the foot of the tower  and called up “Lady Kaede!  What is  happening?  What has caused this storm?”</p><p>
  “I know not!  I  cannot tell if this be an act of god or demon.   I know only that it be the result of a surge of powerful youki!”</p><p>
  “We were caught in the fields!”</p><p>
  “Get everyone into shelter!  I think not this storm shall last, but I fear  it may grow more fierce before it fades!”</p><p>
  She turned back towards the no longer visible light,  feeling as the pulses faded below her ability to sense.  “Be it good or ill, I doubt not that it will  attract more than just my attention…”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>She fled as fast as the wind would carry her, but she  couldn’t outrun the storm.  A wild gust  caught her feather and sent her tumbling, and she crashed into the forest.  Branches slammed into her, knocking the air  from her lungs and left her bruised but alive.   Her heart hammered in her chest as she took inventory.  </p><p>
  Her kimono was in shreds, but that was not  important.  She was alive.</p><p>
  Alive and <em>free</em>!</p><p>
  She laughed as her hand pressed against her naked  breast and felt the pulse of her heart.   Her <em>Heart</em>!  She had been shocked that it had been given  back, and that had nearly been her death.   Naraku knew she had betrayed him, and had sought to kill him in order to  gain her freedom, so when he had confronted her, she had expected only to  die.  Indeed, she would have…</p><p>
  Except that just as he had returned her heart, a surge  of power like she had never felt before had exploded almost overhead, and  thrown both her and Naraku head over heels.  </p><p>
  It had saved her life.   Even as she had sat in numbed shock that her heart had been returned,  she had seen Naraku’s tentacles stabbing towards her.  A second later and she would have been  pierced, her doom sealed.  She hadn’t  even tried to figure out what had happened, simply reasserted control of her  feather and fled as fast as she could</p><p>
  The rain pounded down through the forest, but it was  already lessening.  Whatever had caused  it was fading.  No doubt Naraku had  recovered.  Likely he would investigate  the source of the power surge, but it would not be long before he would be on  the hunt for her.  She was free, but she  doubted he would let her go so easily.   She needed to hide for the moment, then figure out how to escape for  good.</p><p>
  There was a step behind her, faint but audible.  In a panic she whirled, her fan coming up as  she prepared to cast a wind blade, but it wasn’t Naraku.</p><p>
  The girl was strangely dressed, wearing a tight pair  of form fitting pants and a top that clung like a second skin to her breasts  but left her shoulders free.  Her hair  hung in straggles and she was covered in bits of leaf and mud.  All Kagura could see of her face was a pair  of unnaturally red lips.  She staggered,  barely catching herself on a large, strangely shaped weapon, like an axe with a  squared blade.  A bandolier of smaller  versions of the weapon crossed her chest.</p><p>
  “H-help me…”</p><p>
  The weapon fell from her hand as she pitched forward  into the mud under the tree Kagura stood against.  She knelt, her kimono tearing further as the  branches it was caught on refused to relinquish their hold.  The girl seemed human, her pulse weak but  steady under Kagura’s fingers.</p><p>
  Then her eyes caught the edge of the tattoo under the  clinging top, and she brushed away a leaf and drew it down to see the golden  form of an imperial Chinese dragon.  The  eyes of the dragon were piercing, seeming to look right through her.</p><p>
  Curious, but there were more important things to  do.  She looked around and spotted an  overhang that looked likely to harbor a small cave along a nearby stream.  She stood and started to step towards it,  then stopped and looked down.</p><p>
  “Heh, I really am getting soft,” she said as she  stooped to pull the girl’s arm over her shoulder and dragged her towards the  cave…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Rei awoke to the fall of a leaf on her face.  She groaned and brushed it aside.  She must have left her curtains open.</p><p>
  “Kagome!  I  think she’s waking up!” a young voice called from next to her, and Rei’s eyes  snapped open.</p><p>
  She found herself looking into a young kids wide  eyes.  His red hair hung in his eyes, and  his fox ears twitched in excitement.</p><p>
  She blinked, but the ears didn’t go away.  “Oh wow, a Kitsune!”  Almost without her being aware of it her hand  rose to play with the kid’s ears.   “Cuuuuteeee!”</p><p>
  “Hey!” the kitsune giggled. “That tickles!”</p><p>
  Memory hit and she suddenly set up.  “What the hell?  I was at the club.  Where the heck am I?” She looked down to see  she was soaking wet and seemed to have fallen through a tree from the amount of  bark and leaves smeared on her dress. Her hip hurt like hell too.</p><p>
  “Muhashi domain, Sengoku era as best I can tell.” A  new voice chimed in and she turned to see a girl her age dressed in a school  uniform approaching from a nearby stream.   “I am guessing from the cocktail dress that you’re from my era  though.  You from Tokyo?”</p><p>
  Rei blinked.   “Huh?  Sengoku era?  What the hell?”  She looked around.  “Last thing I remember was being in the club  with my friends, then there was this bright light and… um… well nothing.”</p><p>
  “Humm.  I guess  that weird energy pulse was probably what brought you here then.  I’m Kagome Higurashi.  Nice to meet you.”</p><p>
  Rei took the outstretched hand. “Rei Hino, of Hikawa  shrine.”</p><p>
  As her hand touched the girls, a surge of energy  swirled between them.  Rei blinked.  “Wow.   That’s some serious spiritual power you got there.”</p><p>
  Kagome was blinking too.  “You too.   Are you a miko?”</p><p>
  Rei nodded. “My grandfather is the priest of the  shrine, and I’m the temple maiden.”  She  looked around.  “So if I got transported  here by that weird light, how did you get here?”</p><p>
  Kagome smiled.   “I come and go, really.  There’s  this well at the shrine where I live that seems to connect back and forth to  this era. I thought only Inuyasha and I could use it though.”  She turned to a pack nearby.  “I have a spare school outfit if you’d like to  change out of that cocktail dress.  It’s  a couple of days walk back to the well.”   She smiled.  “Not to mention it  would probably be better not to let Miroku see you in that dress, and I expect  that they’ll be back soon.  They went to  see if they could find the other disturbances we felt.  If you were with friends, that might be what  they were.”</p><p>
  “Miroku?”</p><p>
  “He’s a Shinto priest, but he’s also a real letch.  That dress is just way too revealing for your own good when he gets back, not  to mention your missing about half of the back of your skirt.”</p><p>
  Rei sighed and nodded. “Okay.  I can take care of myself if I have to, but  thanks for the warning.  If I have to  walk thorough woods, I certainly am not going to do it in high heels and a  ruined evening gown.  If my friends are  here too, we can discuss what we need to do to get back when they get  here.”  She took the proffered  uniform.  “So where can I change?”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki woke to the sound of wind through the  trees.  Her head hurt, and her body ached  in a dozen places.  She sat up and looked  around.</p><p>
  She was sitting in a forest, and from the look of the  branches scattered around her and the torn state of her dress, she guessed she  must have fallen from the tree above her.</p><p>
  “What the fuck?   What was that light? And where the hell am I?”</p><p>
  Her rabbit ears twitched as she heard the sound of a  footstep nearby.  She tried to cover  herself but the dress was just too shredded.   She looked around quickly and grabbed a rock, then lay back down like  she was still unconscious.</p><p>
  Through slitted eyes she saw a man dressed in the  robes of a Shinto monk step from around a tree.   He stopped when he saw her, and blinked.   Then a leer crossed his face and he stepped forward, his hand reaching  for her naked breasts.</p><p>
  The zanbatou slammed into the tree above her, just a  bare fraction of an inch from the monk’s hand.   “I wouldn’t do that if I were you, priest.  Nabi-chan is likely to brain you with that  rock if you try,” Tao-Ching said from across the clearing.</p><p>
  The monk turned and tried to look innocent. “I was  merely going to check to make sure she was alive.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching grinned.   “Of course you were.  Who could  resist a chance to fondle those incredibly sexy tits?”</p><p>
  Nabiki rolled her eyes.  “Keep it up, furball.  You might not get a chance to fondle them  yourself.”  She set up, and gave her  shredded dress a sad eye. “Plus, this dress cost a bundle, and now it’s just a  rag.”  She sighed, then shrugged.  “Screw it.   Enjoy it while you can boys.”  She  finished the last tears and tossed the dress aside.</p><p>
  The monk blinked as his face turned crimson, and a  foolish grin spread across his face as his eyes roamed up and down her body.</p><p>
  “Oh my… Umm… Could you bear my children?”</p><p>
  Nabiki gave him a sour eye.  “No.   Only children I plan to bear will belong to this lug over here.” She  jerked a thumb at Tao-Ching, who was holding out his shredded tuxedo jacket  towards her almost reluctantly.  She  looked at it’s tattered state and looked heavenward.  “Forget it loverboy.  I really don’t care if I’m naked.  I seriously doubt I have to worry about being  molested while you’re around.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching laughed as he dropped the jacket and opened  his vest to reveal the Desert Eagle.   “Nope.  Least wise not so long as  they want to stay alive.”  He grabbed the  hilt of the zanbatou and with a crack the tree splintered as he freed it. “I’d  offer the shirt, but…” He turned to reveal that most of the back of his vest  and shirt were missing.  “The tree I fell  through seems to have decided it wanted it for a snack.”</p><p>
  He turned to the newcomer. “So mister monk,” he said.  “Where the hell are we?  Last I knew we  were in Nerima ward at the party.  And I  certainly don’t remember taking a walk.”</p><p>
  The monk swallowed hard as he wrenched his eyes from  the lush curves of Nabiki’s body.  “Um…  Muhashi’s Domain actually.  My name is  Miroku, and I am a wandering monk.  I was  seeking the source of a major mystical disturbance, and I strongly suspect that  you would be it.  May I ask where Nerima  domain is?”</p><p>
  “Nerima <em>ward</em>,  Miroku.  Tokyo.”</p><p>
  Light seemed to dawn behind his eyes.  “Ah, you must be from Kagome’s homeland.  She is also from Tokyo.   That explains much.  Perhaps it  will be clearer if I tell you that you are in what she calls the Sengoku Era?”</p><p>
  Nabiki blinked.   “The Sengoku Era?  We got sent  back in time?”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching sighed.   “Okay, based on what Shan-Pu told me about when she got her wish, I’m  going to take a wild guess and say that “nurse” was a goddess granting the old  man a wish.  When he wished we could  return the sword in time to save his family, we must have ended up here.”</p><p>
  Nabiki looked at the katana Tao-Ching had shoved  through his cummerbund.  “Okay.  Then logically if we get that sword back to  the guy who it was stolen from, we’ll probably go back home.”</p><p>
  “Oh joy.  Just  how the hell are we supposed to locate a single samurai in the Sengoku era who  lost a family blade?”  He grimaced.  “And second, is it just us, or did everyone  in the room get sent back?”</p><p>
  The monk was staring at Nabiki again, seemingly  fascinated with the bunny girl’s tail.  “Um…  we felt several disturbances, and found a young black haired girl in a strange  red dress.  My companions are seeking the  other sources.  If you would care to come  with me to where we found the other girl, perhaps my friends and I may be of  some assistance.”  </p><p>
  Nabiki waved him ahead.  “Lead on.   Maybe you can provide us with a tent when we get there.  All this exhibitionism is getting me really  turned on.”</p><p>
  The monk turned crimson again as Tao-Ching chuckled.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“So who the hell are you? And why do you smell like  Sesshomaru?”</p><p>
  Tatewaki opened his eyes and found himself staring at  a white haired boy of his own age, with dog ears and fangs.  He blinked.   An Inu?  His resemblance to his  sister was remarkable.</p><p>
  “I am Tatewaki Kuno, the Blue Thunder of Furinkan High  School and samurai of the Kuno Clan.  And  may I ask who you are?”</p><p>
  The white haired guy blinked.  “Huh?   You’re awfully calm for someone woken up by a youkai.”  He shrugged.   “My name’s Inuyasha.  So why do  you smell like my brother?”  His nose  wrinkled.  “And like that place Kagome  lives too.  That nasty smoke and sulfur  stink she always reeks of when she first gets back.”</p><p>
  Tatewaki took the proffered hand up.  “I know of no Sesshomaru, save that it is the  name of an uncle I have never met. As for the rest, I could not say - and I do  not reek.”</p><p>
  Inuyasha grinned.   “Yeah, if you’re from that Tokyo  place I suppose you’re so used to it you’d never notice, like Kagome.  So are you the source of this “Mystical  Disturbance,” as Miroku called it?</p><p>
  “I have no idea.   I was last in an office in a club, then there was a bright light and now  I find myself here.”  He looked the white  haired youth up and down.  “I note from  your attire that you are a warrior such as myself, yet you openly admit to  being a youkai?”</p><p>
  “Don’t let it upset you.  I don’t prey on humans.”</p><p>
  “I see.  I will  warn you though that it is my family’s duty to defend humanity from the demons  who seek to harm them.”</p><p>
  “Sounds like my line.   Besides from the smell you must have some Inugami in you too.”</p><p>
  Tatewaki nodded. “My family’s patriarch was said to be  descended from the greatest of the Inugami youkai and the fairest of human  maidens.  He was also called  Inuyasha.  The name of Kuno was bestowed  upon us during the reign of Tokugowa.”</p><p>
  “Never heard of him.   The Damiyo of this Domain is Muhashi.”   Inuyasha pointed over his shoulder.   “We found a girl in a strange red dress about a mile or so that  way.  Sound like a friend of yours?”</p><p>
  “I believe it may.   There was a girl in the office when the light occurred who was in a red  dress.  Also a gentleman in a black  tuxedo named Tao-Ching, Nabiki Tendo, who was, I doth believe, in a black  dress, Ukyo Kuonji, also in black, and my fair Goddess, Zhu Shu, who was  wearing a red top and pants.  If they  have accompanied me to this strange locale, it is imperative that we find them  quickly.  Methinks it is doubtful they  would be as prepared to deal with youkai as I.”   His hand gripped the hilt of the katana at his waist.  “The mighty blade of my ancestors, <em>Tetsusaiga</em>, was forged to slay demons.”</p><p>
  Inuyasha blinked.   “What did you say?”  His eyes  locked on the sword in Kuno’s belt.</p><p>
  “My family’s heirloom blade, <em>Tetsusaiga</em>, was forged to slay demons.  I fear for my companions safety should they  be attacked by youkai.”</p><p>
  “That’s impossible,” Inuyasha gripped his own  sword.  “This is <em>Tetsusaiga</em>.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kagura dipped the shreds of her kimono in the stream  and ducked back into the cave.  Now that  the rain had stopped it was best to stay under cover, lest Naraku’s wasps find  her.  But now that she had better light,  she had decided to clean up the girl a little.   Something about her had been naggingly familiar, but she’d been too  covered in mud to tell what it was.</p><p>
  The girl moaned a little as she started to wipe her  face, and she murmured something too faintly to hear.  Then as the rest of the mud was wiped away, Kagura  got a good look at her features.</p><p>
  <em>What the hell?</em></p><p>
  “Kagura?  Is  that you?”</p><p>
  She whirled, her fan snapping open, but more in reflex  than alarm as she recognized the voice.</p><p>
  “Sango.  Dammit,  get out of sight.  Last thing I need is  Naraku finding me.”</p><p>
  The youkai exterminator looked around and ducked into  the cave.  “You’re the last person I  expected to see, Kagura.”</p><p>
  “Humph, I figured you would be chasing after Kohaku.”</p><p>
  “We started to but some sort of mystical explosion  occurred.  It knocked me and Kirara out  of the sky, and Kagome thinks it sent Kohaku a lot further than you intended.  She felt him passing out of range of her  senses far to the west, away from where you directed us to hunt for Mouryoumaru.”</p><p>
  Kagura surprised herself by feeling relieved.  “That is good.”</p><p>
  Sango nodded.   “I thank you for saving him from Hakudoushi.  The offer still stands to join us.  We <em>will</em> get your heart back for you.”</p><p>
  Kagura laughed.   “This morning I refused you simply because I really didn’t think you could  beat Naraku, but now I think I have no other choice but to hope you will.  I <em>have</em> my heart back, Sango.  And if that  strange storm hadn’t shown up when it did, I would be dead right now.  The only reason that bastard returned it was  to torture me even more as he killed me.”</p><p>
  Sango raised an eyebrow.  “That storm is what brought me out here.  One of the disturbances was near here  according to Kirara.”</p><p>
  “The center was right over where Naraku nearly killed  me.”  Kagura sighed. “You are being  awfully friendly to someone who has tried to kill you so many times, Sango.”</p><p>
  The other girl shrugged.  “You’ve proven that you’re not my enemy  anymore.  And you saved my brother’s  life.  I’m willing to give you a fair  chance to be a friend.”</p><p>
  “I see.  Well I  dare say your ‘disturbance’ is probably this girl here.  Maybe you can explain something for me.”</p><p>
  Sango looked as Kagura moved to reveal the unconscious  girl, and her eyes widened.</p><p>
  “Any idea why she has your face?”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>“What?”</p><p>
  “You heard me Urd.   I was on an authorized assignment.   Ano Hasai was duly registered in Yggdrasil’s database as deserving of a  wish.  His wish was that Tao-Ching could  return the family’s heirloom blade in time to save his family from the  misfortunes caused by its loss.   Yggdrasil gave a seventy percent likelihood that the companions sent  back in time with him would successfully allow Tao-Ching to not only complete  the delivery of the sword, but even gave him a fifty-five percent chance to  break the Hibiki curse while doing so.   Like it or not Urd, I was doing my job!”</p><p>
  Urd scowled at Peorth, and looked to Mara. “Fuck.”</p><p>
  Mara shrugged.   “The question Urd, was whether that was the <em>only</em> way the wish could have been granted.  Take it from me as your ex-nemesis, the  Nifelheim system will generally spit out a list of possible variants that any  given wish could take.  I had a friend  who was a sysop, and she’d slip me an occasional bit of info on the possible  options the Ultimate force might use to ensure a wish was met so I could try to  foil it.”</p><p>
  Urd nodded.   “Yeah, most Goddesses only do wish transfers, but as sysop I can look up  that same info.”  She fixed Peorth with a  dark look.  “If I was being clever, I  could probably manipulate a grantee to word a wish in a particular way if I  knew ahead of time what the possible wishes he might be likely ask for were.”</p><p>
  Peorth looked like she was grinding her teeth.  “There’s no way you could prove that Urd, no matter how pissed you might be  that my duty crossed paths with this fucked up wish you’re supposedly trying to  grant.  You’d think that since the  Ultimate Force won’t touch it, you’d get the hint.”</p><p>
  “The Ultimate Force won’t help me because that was one  of the conditions of the test, Peorth.  Dad  is going to hear about this.”</p><p>
  “He’s the one who signed my orders, Urd.” Peorth  sniffed.  “Regardless, I am done being  interrogated.  If you’re upset, take it  up with Megami-Sama.”  In a huff, she  turned to leave the office.</p><p>
  “May I ask a question, Peorth?” Belldandy interjected  before she had made it to the door.  “Do <em>you</em> have any idea what that backsurge  was?”</p><p>
  “How should I know?   I’m going to check the logs when I get back to Heaven and file a  report.  Check with the admin department  if you want to know what I find out.”</p><p>
  Belldandy sighed as the other goddess stormed  out.  “I wish I knew why she has always  seemed to hate the both of us, Urd.”</p><p>
  “She’s a stuck up bitch, Bell.”</p><p>
  Urd looked out the door, where the opening night party  was slowly breaking up, then over at the Senshi and Akane.  “I will try to find out if I can get everyone  back from the Sengoku Era, but it may take some time.”</p><p>
  The Senshi gave each other concerned looks.  Akane frowned.  “I’m really worried Miss Urd.  I can’t feel Zhu-chan at all.”</p><p>
  Urd raised an eyebrow.   “That’s funny.  A soulbond like  yours to Zhu Shu should resonate on the temporal bands and give you <em>some</em> sense of her.  I wonder if that backlash was due to her link  to the Dragon.”</p><p>
  “Indeed it was, Goddess Urd,” an unknown voice said.  They all turned to see a girl standing behind  the desk.  She was dressed in a short  cheongsam, and her long pink hair was flowing as if it was being ruffled by a  gentle breeze.</p><p>
  She was also transparent.</p><p>
  Akane blinked in shock.  “Ying-Ying?” she asked in astonishment. </p><p>
  The girl nodded.   “Ni hao Akane-chan.  I am glad to  see you still retain Zhu Shu’s memories of me.” She turned back to the white  haired goddess.  “I was sent by Legend to  deliver a message, Goddess Urd.”</p><p>
  Urd nodded.   “Must be important if he gave a ghost enough energy to appear in the  material world.”</p><p>
  “Oh, no, Goddess Urd.   I am able to be here because my love found the path to me, and through  her I have a path here as well.  Legend  sent me simply because it was convenient.   I was asked to tell you that what has occurred was arranged.  I delivered Peorth’s assignment myself.  Legend asks that you recall your conversation  with him.”</p><p>
  Urd nodded. “Ah.   So this was the event he was talking about.”</p><p>
  Ying-Ying nodded.   “I was also asked to tell the Senshi that Akane could fill in for Rei  for the time being.”</p><p>
  “What?” five voices chorused in unison.</p><p>
  Ying-Ying nodded, and drew from her back Zhu Shu’s  transformation wand.  “Sailor Mars is  needed elsewhere.  In her stead Legend  asks that you, Akane-chan, accept the role of Sailor Earth for the  duration.  Once, long ago Empress Lin Tzu  was granted this role, though it was a lesser duty to her role as Empress.  You posses the power to be a Senshi,  Akane-chan, granted to you through your link to Zhu Shu.  The Dragon asks that you accept this task for  the sake of his daughter, and the love you bear her.”</p><p>
  Akane sat down hard.   “Oh fucking awesome.”  She sighed  heavily.  “Alright, I guess.  I doubt that being a Senshi will be any more  dangerous than being Zhu Shu’s friend right now.  At least I can’t <em>recall</em> any fights you girls have had with a dragon.”</p><p>
  “Wow, Akane-chan, you fought a dragon?” Usagi  said.  “We usually get weird slime  monsters and stuff.  A dragon sounds so  cool!”</p><p>
  Makoto laughed.   “Leave it to you, Princess.  I  doubt Akane-chan was any less terrified than we are during a fight.”  She stuck out her hand to Akane.  “I for one would welcome you,  Akane-sensei.  You’re better than any of  us in straight combat, and since it seems we’ve got some new enemies in town, I  dare say we can use your help.”</p><p>
  Akane nodded and took the pen from Ying-Ying’s ghostly  hand.  “I guess you can tell the Dragon  that on Zhu Shu’s behalf I accept, Ying-Ying.”</p><p>
  The ghost gave her a hug.  “You’re going to be awesome, Akane-sama!”  Her lips met Akane’s, and the Japanese girl  felt as if her entire insides were melting and freezing in incredible ecstasy  as time stood still.  Then Ying-Ying  leaned back and giggled.  </p><p>
  “Wow.” Akane managed to say.</p><p>
  “I thought you should get to be on the <em>receiving</em> end of a chi kiss, my dear  tigress.”</p><p>
  Akane nodded in dreamy bliss.  “So <em>that’s</em> what it feels like… No wonder Shan-chan and Ranma beg for them.”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Konatsu groaned and shook her head.  </p><p>
  What the hell had happened?  She groggily turned her head and looked  around.  No, it was still this strange  cave.  She had been burning the last  remains of that damn teahouse her stepmother had forced her to work at, happy  she had finally been freed.  The gods had  finally seen fit to bless her, and after all her failed attempts to kill the  evil woman and her ugly stepsisters too!   Those damn cigars her mother smoked had  finally been the death of her. Oh what luck the kerosene she had been  collecting for years had caught fire and exploded!  She hadn’t even cared about the little man  who had stolen all of her panties just before the shop blew up!  She’d been dancing for joy when the fire  department had finally showed up, the last of her stores of kerosene used up to  ensure the entire building was ablaze.   When they had finally left after confirming the deaths of her family,  she could barely contain her joy and had re-lit the remains to enjoy the lovely  flames…</p><p>
  Then, suddenly she had woken up in this cave, and no  sooner looked around than some sort of dizzy spell had hit and she’d fainted.</p><p>
  She went to sit up, and felt an unfamiliar drag on her  chest.  She looked down.</p><p>
  And blinked.</p><p>
  Almost involuntarily her hand rose and caressed the  full, heavy breasts, bigger even than she’d ever padded her tunic out to  be.  She shuddered as her hand crossed  her nipples.</p><p>
  They were <em>real</em>.</p><p>
  Her hand slid further down, and felt only tangled  curls, and then a warm wetness.</p><p>
  Sixteen years she had wished for this, and now to be  rid of both her accursed step-family, and her shame…</p><p>
  Fifteen or so minutes later, when the hysterical  laughter finally left her gasping and sore, she collected enough of her wits to  take a good look around the cave.  She  found her clothes neatly stacked on a bench, and tucked into them was a note.</p><p>
  <em>Hot water will turn you back to your  normal sex, Cold water will restore this one. </em></p><p>
  The note was unsigned, and the handwriting  unfamiliar.  She looked at the kettle  that had been next to her clothes, and the bucket of water.  A few moments later she toweled herself off  and pouted.  Oh, if only she had been  changed forever!</p><p>
  Still, if she just avoided hot water for the most  part, she might never have to reveal her shame again.  It wasn’t like she was ever going to get to  be a wife… who would ever want a kunoichi like her any way?  One who was so ugly, and talentless?  A true kunoichi was beautiful and deadly, as  lethal as she was seductive, and she was neither.  No wonder her mother and siblings had treated  her so poorly!</p><p>
  She shook herself and reached for her clothes  morosely.  It took a few minutes to  adjust all her weapons, and reluctantly she tossed aside the pepper bags.  However, getting dressed had cheered her up a  bit.  Her bust was so large she had  barely been able to pull on her mesh undersuit, and her top was showing considerable  cleavage.  Ooooooh, she hoped she’d be  able to steal a few cute girly outfits and a mirror!  Large breasts and the proper hairstyle would  do much to make up for her other deficiencies . </p><p>
  After spending a few moments looking around, she found  that nothing else in the room seemed to be of any use to her.  And the only exit led to a strangely foggy  corridor.  </p><p>
  Her nose couldn’t pick up the scent of any poisons in  the mist, so she tied a light rope to one of the torch holders that supported  her weight, and stepped into the swirling fog.  </p><p>
  In just a few steps, she found herself standing by the  still smoldering ruins of her former home.   She turned and found her rope laying cut, only the forest behind her.</p><p>
  She shrugged.   The rumbling of her stomach seemed far more important right now.  She turned towards the road that led out of  the valley.  It was at least a three  hour’s walk to Tokyo,  and hopefully some food.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Ukyo’s eyes snapped open to see a slab of dirty rock  above her head instead of her bedroom ceiling.</p><p>
  “Oh, you’re awake.”</p><p>
  She realized she seemed to be in a cave.  Oh yeah, that bright light, and then she’d  fallen.  Crashed into a tree then dropped  into a stream just as a horrendous storm broke.   Her head still throbbed from the branch she’d hit on the way down.</p><p>
  She turned to the voice, and dimly remembered seeing  the woman who was sitting next to her.   She’d heard the sound of someone else falling out of a tree and tried to  go to the sound, but the pain in her head had been so strong.</p><p>
  “Don’t try to move too much just yet.  Sango said she thought you might have hurt  your head.  She should be back soon with  some help.”</p><p>
  “Who- who are you?”</p><p>
  “Humm?  I am  Kagura of the Wind.  Do you have a name?”</p><p>
  “Ukyo.  Ukyo Kuonji.  Where- where am I?”</p><p>
  “At the moment, a cave.  Probably still in Muhashi’s domain, though I  couldn’t tell you for certain.  I wasn’t  really paying attention to landmarks as I fled.”</p><p>
  Muhashi’s domain sounded familiar too, though she  couldn’t place it at the moment.  Her  head was clearing though, and she felt more awake.  She looked more closely at the woman, noting  the pointed ears and red irised eyes, the midnight  black hair pulled back into a short cropped pony tail.  Not to mention that she was sitting topless  and seemed utterly unconcerned by the fact.   Beyond her it looked like the storm was over and the sun was shining on  the forest across the stream.  Kagura  turned to look as well, and Ukyo saw a large burn scar on her back that looked  a lot like a spider.</p><p>
  There was a soft noise from outside the cave, then a  familiar face peeked into the cave.  </p><p>
  “Hey Ukyo.   You’re looking better than I was expecting.” Nabiki said.  Ukyo blinked as the bunny girl stepped into  the cave.  Nabiki noted the look and  laughed.  “Yeah, I <em>am</em> naked.  I fell through a  damn tree and shredded my dress all to hell.   Nobody seems to have any spare clothes just yet though.  Looks like you lost your vest too.”</p><p>
  Ukyo looked down and realized Nabiki was right, though  fortunately her tube top and form fitting pants had fared far better than  Nabiki’s evening wear.  </p><p>
  Nabiki was running her eyes up and down the other  woman’s figure.  Ukyo had been around Zhu  Shu enough to recognize that lustful look.   She shook her head.</p><p>
  “Okay, if you’re here I guess I wasn’t the only one who  got hit by that weird light.”</p><p>
  “Nope.   Tao-Ching is pretty sure we got caught up in a wish for the old man, Mr.  Hasai.  What happened is apparently  similar to what Shan-Pu told him happened when she got her wish.  We’re in the Sengoku Era.”</p><p>
  “What?”</p><p>
  “Yeah, the old guy wished we could return the sword in  time to save his family, so here we are.”   She looked over her shoulder.   “Yo, Tao-baby! Look’s like she’s okay.” She shouted.  “But there’s another hottie in here who might  appreciate a shirt.”  </p><p>
  “Just a sec, Nabi-chan.” Tao-Ching’s voice came back  from above.  “I was stripping  anyway.  No point trudging through these  woods when you can ride.”</p><p>
  A few seconds later, Tao-Ching’s tux, much the worse  for wear, was dropped to Nabiki.  She  turned to Kagura, who had been watching warily.   “It’s not much but here’s his coat.   I’m waiting for some <em>real</em> clothes.”</p><p>
  Kagura shrugged and took the proffered garment.  “Sango had said she was going to get her  friends, and that she had spare yakuta.”</p><p>
  “Yeah, we met her.   She ran across us as she was heading back, so we came here.  From what that lecherous priest said, I think  Rei was already at their camp.  Sango  kind of dragged him off with her when she found us.  I suspect she wasn’t too happy with the  drooling he was doing over me.”</p><p>
  There was some splashing, and then Tao-Ching’s huge  feline head looked around the edge of the cave.   Nabiki scratched his ears affectionately.  “You got their scent?”</p><p>
  The smilodon nodded. </p><p>
  “You better not get us lost you big lug.  We’re counting on your nose.”</p><p>
  He snarled non-committally.</p><p>
  Kagura was looking at the cat strangely.  Nabiki noted it and tilted her head at the  other woman.  “Don’t let him worry  you.  He’s just cursed to turn into a big  cat.”</p><p>
  Kagura nodded.   “So I see.  Yet I sense another  curse on him as well.  One who’s source I  know all too well.  So you have dealt  with Naraku before.”</p><p>
  Nabiki raised her eyebrow.  “Naraku, humm?  And what do you know about Naraku?”</p><p>
  Kagura’s fan slid open and she fanned herself with  it.  “That depends very much on if you  serve him or not.”</p><p>
  “Serve him?   Fuck no.  The bastard cursed the  entire Hibiki line and stole the family’s sword.”</p><p>
  The big cat rolled his eyes.  Nabiki bopped him on the ear.  “I don’t care whether you believe in the  Hibiki curse, Tao-baby.  I don’t plan to  get stuck with it when I marry you.  So,  so long as we are back here, I plan to track this Naraku asshole down and make  him break the curse.”</p><p>
  Kagura seemed to relax.  “So, you too are his enemies.”</p><p>
  Nabiki shrugged.   “I guess you can say that.”</p><p>
  Kagura smiled slightly.  </p><p>
  Nabiki turned back to Ukyo.  “You ready to ride?  At best guess all of us who were in the  office showed up here, so if Rei is at their camp, that means we still need to  find Kuno and Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded.   “Well Zhu-chan should be-” she broke off.</p><p>
  “What’s wrong?” Nabiki asked.</p><p>
  “Zhu Shu!  I- I  can’t feel her in my head!”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Inuyasha examined the transformed blade for the  dozenth time.  “This makes no sense.  How can this be <em>Tetsusaiga</em>?”</p><p>
  Kuno had yielded to the others request to examine the  blade.  “I know only that this blade has  been in my family for nearly 300 years, though much of its history was  lost.  I spent months polishing and  sharpening the blade when first my father left our home and it came into my  care.  I learned its true name but  recently, when with it I slew a demon of darkness, and it grew to that massive  size.  My Grandfather had called it the  Demon’s Fang.”</p><p>
  Inuyasha sheathed it again, the blade transforming  once more as he did so.  “I can’t doubt  that it looks like my sword, though I’ve never seen <em>Tetsusaiga</em> in it’s untransformed form looking so pretty.”  He handed Kuno back the blade and drew his  own.  “It’s always looked pretty ratty  when it’s not transformed.”</p><p>
  Kuno nodded.  “I  do recall that my blade did look much as yours when first I came into  possession of it.”</p><p>
  “I guess I am going to have to ask Totosai about  it.  It seems to be identical but there  is a very different feel to it.  I could  only get it to change to it’s base form.”</p><p>
  The blade in Inuyasha’s hand shifted in appearance,  first to red, then to what appeared to be diamond.  “I could feel the other forms, but your sword  wouldn’t obey me.”</p><p>
  Kuno drew his sword, and tried to figure out how to  make it change.  It seemed easy enough to  get it to transform into the giant blade, but that was all.</p><p>
  A roar from overhead made him look up as the blade  shifted back to it’s normal form.  A  large cat was descending, its feet flaming and twin tails lashing.  A woman and someone dressed as a monk rode  its back.  He looked to Inuyasha, and saw  that he was unconcerned.</p><p>
  “Yo, Sango, I found him!” Inuyasha called.</p><p>
  The cat landed, and the woman looked Kuno over.  “So I see.   We found a couple of other people too.   Are you Kuno?</p><p>
  Tatewaki bowed.   “Indeed fair maiden.  I am  Tatewaki Kuno, Devil Hunter and Samurai of the Kuno clan.  I am honored to make the acquaintance of such  beauty in this wilderness.”</p><p>
  Sango gave him a smile.  “Well spoken, sir, though not what I was  warned to expect by Nabiki Tendo.”</p><p>
  Kuno sighed.  “Indeed,  once I was a shameful man who passed my days in vain pursuit of beautiful  maidens.  I strive to be so no  longer.  The nobility of my line, and our  duty to stand guard against the depredations of youkai was revealed to mine  eyes but recently, and I have dedicated my life to these goals.”</p><p>
  The monk nodded.   “Noble sentiments indeed, Sir Kuno.   We came to lead you to our camp.   Only one of your companions still seems to be lost, if the list Rei Hino  gave me was correct.  Someone called Zhu  Shu.”</p><p>
  Kuno straightened.   “Nay, good monk.  If my fair  Chinese Goddess is endangered, I cannot cravenly seek the safety of thy  camp.  She must be found!” The blade in  his hands suddenly transformed again and he shouldered it.  “Such delicate beauty as hers would tempt the  foulest fiends to possess her.  I must go  to her at once!”</p><p>
  Both Sango and Miroku stared at the blade in  shock.  Inuyasha laughed.  “Worry about it later guys.  Which way is the last disturbance?”</p><p>
  “To the east,” Sango said.”</p><p>
  Inuyasha nodded.   “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Kagura couldn’t believe she was actually doing this.</p><p>
  Her feather was speeding along, Kagome and Rei behind  her while Ukyo, Shippou, and Nabiki rode Tao-Ching below.  Ukyo’s worry over Zhu Shu had driven them to  head towards the last disturbance…</p><p>
  The one that had saved her life.  The one where she had nearly been killed by  Naraku.</p><p>
  Kagome had an arrow nocked and ready while Rei fairly  crackled with power, the strange transformation she had undergone when she had  been made aware of the danger Naraku posed seemingly amplifying the strange  priestess’ powers enormously.  Nabiki was  wearing some strange form of weapon like those that had been brought by the  Dutch traders, but that Kagome had said was far more powerful than a  “flintlock” whatever that meant.  Ukyo of  course had her strange axe.</p><p>
  She hoped it would be sufficient to at least let them  escape if Naraku was still in the vicinity, and Sango had said they would send  Inuyasha towards the area too.  Maybe she <em>would</em> live out the day.</p><p>
  Her heart was hammering, a sensation she was extremely  unused to feeling.  Yet much as she  feared for her life, she had volunteered to lead them.</p><p>
  And somehow, she couldn’t help but feel that she owed  this Zhu Shu.  The disturbance caused by  her fall had been all that had saved her from Naraku.  </p><p>
  “I can feel a shard ahead!” Kagome said.  “But it’s not large enough to be the Jewel.”</p><p>
  Kagura nodded. “We are near the place where I fled  Naraku.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Inuyasha gaped at the devastation.  The forest had suddenly ended, the trees  shattered to splinters around a large crater.   Sango and Miroku joined him at the edge of the trees as he held up his  hand to stop Kuno.</p><p>
  “Careful.  I  smell Naraku.”</p><p>
  “Well, well, well.   Inuyasha.  What a pleasant  surprise.  And here I was, just hoping  that you would drop in.”</p><p>
  The air above the crater shimmered, and a white  cloaked form stepped onto the crater’s edge from nowhere.  The baboon mask seemed to smile evilly.</p><p>
  “I apologize for not being here in person, Inuyasha,  but other business has proven far more pressing. But never fear, I have  prepared a suitable welcome for you.”  A  figure in a dark cloak stepped up from the crater, the deep hood shadowing it’s  face.  </p><p>
  Inuyasha blinked.   It smelled like nothing he had ever smelled before, redolent of spices  and another, almost reptilian scent.  And  it’s hood hung strangely, as if the figure was wearing a wide helm.  Was this a new creation of Naraku?</p><p>
  “I don’t care what new monster you made Naraku.  I’ll kill it like all the others.  Just like I will kill you!”</p><p>
  Kuno stepped forward.   “Demon!  Away with you or face the  wrath of Tatewaki Kuno!”</p><p>
  An evil chuckle came from the baboon mask.  “Indeed.   From a foolish human I have little to fear.  Yet the same cannot be said of you.  Farewell Inuyasha.”</p><p>
  The figure of Naraku faded away as Inuyasha drew <em>Tetsusaiga</em>.  “Do your worst, fool!”</p><p>
  From under the figure’s hood a stream of flames shot  out to engulf Inuyasha, and even through his fire rat tunic he could feel the  heat.  He blinked in shock as the fabric  actually started to burn. Then a sixth sense for danger caused him to dodge,  narrowly avoiding getting spitted on a long curved sword.  A second sword cut towards his head, only  barely blocked in time by Kuno.  </p><p>
  There was no time for words.  He blocked and parried furiously, the figure  moving its blades so fast he never had a chance to counter attack, even though  the cloaked figure fought Kuno as well.   Miroku and Sango had to dance out of the way, never managing to get a shot  in as the two swordsmen tried to match the weaving blades of their foe.</p><p>
  Then from overhead he heard a cry of “Mars Firebird,  Attack!” and a bird of flame dove into the whirling dervish.</p><p>
  The burning figure turned to face the new threat, and  stopped.  Then the cloak burned away and  Inuyasha saw his attacker for the first time.</p><p>
  She was small, her skin a charcoal grey that seemed to  glitter like a snake’s scales, and the three horns that poked out of her jet  black hair from either side of her head were razor sharp and shone like  blackened steel.  Small wings grew from  her back and a tail lashed behind her. Her eyes were a solid black, deep pools  which seemed to suck in all the light, and from her ears hung large gold hoops  connected by fine chains with tiny bells to a series of cuffs that ran up her  ears.  The embers of her clothes still  burned about her, their heat seeming to affect her not at all.  Only the ribbons attached to her swords  remained unconsumed, the crimson cloth curling around her like writhing  serpents.</p><p>
  Kagome stood next to the girl Inuyasha remembered from  the camp, accompanied by several others, including Kagura.  But all the new people were staring at the  attacker.</p><p>
  Then the girl who had sent the firebird spoke.  </p><p>
  “Zhu Shu?”</p><p>
  In a swirl of sparks, the dragon girl disappeared.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>“There’s no doubt about it, she was the one who had  the shard.” Kagome said in answer to Ukyo’s questions.  “And it was as black as midnight.   Naraku’s controlling her.”</p><p>
  Tao-Ching growled as Nabiki softly said “Fuck.”</p><p>
  “How can we save her?” Ukyo asked flatly.</p><p>
  “If we can remove the shard…” Kagome spread her hands. </p><p>
  “As fast as she was, that isn’t going to be easy.”  Inuyasha said.  “I never even had a  chance to attack.”</p><p>
  “And Naraku might kill her at any time.” Kagura  said.  “That’s if he doesn’t send her up  against Mouryoumaru.”</p><p>
  Ukyo held up her hands, “Okay, enough.”  She pointed to Kagome.  “I met you on a train a few days ago in Tokyo, which means  there’s some way back to our time.   That’s good enough for me, but none of us knows what the fuck is going  here. Who the fuck is Naraku?  And this Mouryoumaru?  Or this ‘shard’?  And what the fuck happened to Zhu Shu!”</p><p>
  Kagome looked around at her friends, and sighed.  “Okay, bear with me.  To begin, yes, I am from Tokyo too.   There’s a well that I can pass through to get here.  I am hoping that it will work for you to get  back as well.  This is the Sengoku era,  exactly when I have no clue.  However,  fifty years ago <em>here</em>, a priestess  called Kikyou was in charge of a sacred jewel, the Shikon, or the Jewel of Four  Souls.  Ask Miroku later what that refers  to.  Anyway, she was purifying the jewel,  which is a huge repository of spiritual power.   It can make any demon more powerful just by possessing a small  shard.  Inuyasha here met Kikyou back  then and she fell in love with him, but there was this guy, Onigumo, who out of  desire for Kikyou sold his soul to a bunch of youkai.  When he did this, Naraku was born.  Naraku tricked Kikyou into sealing Inuyasha  to a tree, and killed her, trying to posses the Shikon, but Kikyou had it  burned with her when she died.”</p><p>
  Ukyo nodded.   “Okay.”</p><p>
  “I-” Kagome pointed to herself, “-am apparently the  reincarnation of Kikyou’s soul.  When I  first came here, by falling into the well, we found out that the Shikon jewel  had also reincarnated with me.  A youkai  tried to steal it, but I unsealed Inuyasha and he saved me, but right after  that, the jewel got broken.”</p><p>
  “You mean <em>YOU</em> broke it.”  Inuyasha said.</p><p>
  “<em>Whatever</em>,  it broke and scattered all over Japan.  My friends here have been trying to reclaim  it.  Unfortunately, Naraku has been  too.  He’s got most of the shard though  because Kikyou, who got brought back to life by an Oni witch, gave it to  him.  She has been fighting against him,  but for some reason she seems to want him to complete the jewel.”</p><p>
  “So why would Naraku want Zhu Shu?” Nabiki asked.</p><p>
  “Naraku seems to be having a problem with his own  heart.  He placed it into a baby and it  seems the baby is now trying to kill Naraku so that it can replace him.  Mouryoumaru is the baby’s guardian,” Kagura  supplied.  “I am also one of Naraku’s  offspring, and I was being used by the baby to try and help him grow more  powerful.  Naraku was about to kill me  for that, and for the fact that I betrayed him and tried to free myself from  his control, when your friend’s appearance saved me.  I didn’t know what had happened, I was just  running away as fast as I could.  My  guess would be considering the talents your friend displayed fighting Inuyasha,  that he will probably use her against Mouryoumaru.”</p><p>
  Rei grimaced.   “I hate to tell you this, but she was hardly showing a fraction of what  she could do.  I’d even go so far as to  say she was moving kind of slow for her.”</p><p>
  Kuno nodded.   “Tis true.  Zhu Shu can move  faster than the humming bird’s wings do flap.”</p><p>
  “That’s not the worst of it though,” Rei said. “Zhu  Shu is the last descendant of her clan, and the heir of some sort of  deity.  When she’s prepared, she’s got  the ability to absorb and redirect amazing amounts of power.  You saw how useless my firebird was against  her.  She could take on all of the Senshi  and probably beat us.”</p><p>
  Kagome tilted her head.  “Are you really Sailor Mars?”</p><p>
  Rei nodded.</p><p>
  “Wow. You guys are famous.”</p><p>
  Rei snorted.  “I  wish I had the rest of the group here.”</p><p>
  “Well, I have a couple of things I want to know,”  Inuyasha said and poked a talon at Ukyo.   “For instance, why do you look like Sango’s twin, and how the hell did  you,” his finger moved to Kuno, “happen to have a copy of <em>Tetsusaiga</em>.”</p><p>
  “I think that’s obvious, Inuyasha.” Kagome said.  “I remember thinking when I met Ukyo on the  train that she looked like Sango, and I thought she might be a descendant-”</p><p>
  A strange look came to Kagome’s face.</p><p>
  “What?” Inuyasha demanded.</p><p>
  Kagome shook her head.   “I’m not going to ask.  I’m  not!  I don’t want to know!”</p><p>
  Nabiki looked between her and Inuyasha and then shook  her head.  “I remember Lo Shen saying you  had a lot of inugami in your family line, Kuno-baby.”</p><p>
  Kuno nodded. “I admit to that with no shame.  My line was founded by the greatest of the inugami  youkai, who did bear the same name as our acquaintance Inuyasha here.”</p><p>
  Kagome looked sick.   Sango and Miroku exchanged glances.   Shippou looked puzzled.</p><p>
  “Do your family legends say anything about who his  wife was?” Nabiki asked.</p><p>
  “Only that she was a beautiful shrine maiden of  enormous spiritual power who did tame his heart.”</p><p>
  Kagome balled up her fists and punched Inuyasha.  “You- You-”    Her face went crimson in rage.  “<em>SITSITSITSITSITSITSITSITSITSIT!!!!!!</em>”</p><p>
  The Nerima crew looked on in astonishment as Inuyasha  slammed into the ground and seemed to be driven deeper with every repetition.  Then Kagome turned and fled the encampment.</p><p>
  Ukyo raised an eyebrow.  “Okay, now I know what she meant when she  said she was going to make him sit in a river till he drowned, but why would  finding out that Kuno is her great great whatever grandson make her so upset?”</p><p>
  Rei nodded, “Yeah, I mean, isn’t she a miko?  I know she lives at a shrine.”</p><p>
  Inuyasha groaned as Sango sighed.  “Kikyou is also a miko.”  She looked at Ukyo.  “So you are a descendant, humm?  Any legends about your ancestors you care to  share?”</p><p>
  Ukyo shrugged.   “The Kuonji clan is descended from a long line of youkai exterminators  is about all I know.  You’d have to ask  my great-uncle to find out any more than that.”   She stood. “However, we now know what we need to know.  It’s time to find Zhu Shu.”</p><p>
  Nabiki gasped.   Ukyo turned to look at her. “What?”</p><p>
  Nabiki pointed to her shoulder.  “I just noticed.  When did you get a copy of Zhu Shu’s tattoo?”</p><p>
  “<em>What?</em>”  Ukyo tried to look at her back and failed  miserably.</p><p>
  Kagura raised an eyebrow.  “It was on her back when I first met her.”</p><p>
  Ukyo pulled up the back of her tube top at Nabiki’s  request, and the bunny girl let out a hum of interest.  “It’s not exactly the same though.  The Dragon is the same, and the swords with  their ribbons, but the spatula has been replaced by a banner with a stylized imperial  dragon.  The staff in the center has been  replaced by a very large naginata, and the Tigress has been replaced too.  The claw is reaching for a phoenix.”  </p><p>
  Rei looked at the tattoo as well.  “That’s Lin Tzu’s banner, Nabiki.  Can you pull your pants down a little  Ukyo?  Zhu Shu’s tattoo has a set of  Senshi symbols at the base of the staff.”   Rei shook her head when Ukyo did so.   “That’s different too.  There is a  black Chinese dragon curled in a circle, but its tail is touching the throwing  star.”</p><p>
  Ukyo sighed.   “Damn it.  It seems even the  Dragon is trying to push me into loving Zhu Shu.  I like boys!”   The last sentence came out as a plaintive sigh.  “Remind me when we rescue her to have her  tell the Dragon off for me.”</p><p>
  Rei laughed.   “It won’t do any good, Ukyo.  But  for what it’s worth I’ll try to remember.   Now, does anyone know which way we should head to find this Naraku and  kill him?  Something tells me that we’re  here for a purpose and until we receive some clearer sign, rescuing Zhu-chan is  top of my list.”</p><p>
  Ukyo cracked her knuckles while Tao-Ching rumbled in  agreement.</p><p>
  Nabiki frowned.   “This may not be important, but something is nagging me.  Tao-Ching’s grandfather told me that Naraku  placed a curse on the Hibiki line, and based on what you guy’s have said, this  Naraku does nothing without a reason, nothing which does not serve him, or  protect him in some way.”</p><p>
  Miroku nodded.   “The curse he placed on my grandfather was done because he had come too  close to killing the fiend.”</p><p>
  “Then I have to wonder about the Hibiki curse.  Supposedly it was placed on them because the  entire clan sought revenge for the murder of their patriarch, and to recover <em>Burekaishi</em>, a sword created by a guy  named Totosai, who Lo Shen said made <em>Tetsusaiga</em> too.”</p><p>
  Sango shouldered her massive boomerang.  “Well, since I have no doubt that Mouryoumaru  will have moved from wherever he was hiding now that Kagura has joined us, and until  we get some clue to Naraku’s whereabouts, I suggest we go see the smith.  My village is on the way, and we can restock  and get you clothes that fit better than my spare kimonos..”</p><p>
  Nabiki jerked a thumb at the still unconscious  Inuyasha.  “Then dig loverboy out of the  dirt and let’s go find Kagome and get started.   I thought I lost Zhu-chan once, and I will be damned if I am going to  let a two bit jumped up youkai get away with taking my sister from me again!”</p>
