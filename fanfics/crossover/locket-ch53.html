<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 53 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/locket-ch52.html">Back to Part 52</a><pre>        &quot;I&#39;m just a gigolo, and everywhere I go,
        People know what part I&#39;m playing,
        Pay for every dance, selling sweet romance,
        Oh, what are they saying...&quot;

        Juri smiled, watching the blonde twins singing with great 
enthusiasm up on the heart decorated kareoke stage. The cat-ears weren&#39;t 
too odd looking, though the orange haired woman did find herself 
wondering why they were wearing those military style uniforms.

        &#39;And here comes another one,&#39; Juri noted as the shorter black 
haired young woman stalked through the crowd, her own uniform crisp and 
neat.

        &quot;I&#39;m told I need to check these in,&quot; the woman noted, taking a 
pistol from her holster, then unstrapping a baton from her side.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri smiled and offered her hand, &quot;I&#39;m Arisugawa 
Juri, the owner and operator of this club.&quot;

        &quot;Leona Ozaki,&quot; the woman shook it, &quot;and the two up on stage 
killing that song are Anna and Uni Puma, my partners.&quot;

        &quot;What can I get you?&quot; Ryouko asked, putting the weapons behind 
the bar.

        Leona looked at the cyan haired bartender and smiled slightly, 
&quot;Beer, thanks.&quot;

        &quot;Leona!&quot; One of the blondes threw her arms around the shorter 
woman, then the other grabbed her, sandwiching her between them.

        &quot;Are you gonna get us a beer, too?&quot; the other twin batted her 
eyes at Leona.

        &quot;Anna, Uni, get off of me,&quot; Leona growled out. She wiggled free 
before saying, &quot;All right, one beer each.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Minagi chuckled, moving to get two more cans of beer.

        &quot;You&#39;re twins too, cool,&quot; Anna beamed. She dropped her voice, 
&quot;Isn&#39;t Leona handsome? We&#39;ve been sharing her.&quot;

        Ryouko grinned while Minagi visibly sweatdropped. &quot;I really 
didn&#39;t need to know that,&quot; she murmured back quietly.

        &quot;Come on, you two,&quot; Leona walked off with Anna on one side, Uni 
on the other. &quot;Try to stay out of trouble, and I&#39;ll buy you dinner.&quot;

        &quot;Waii,&quot; Uni hugged Leona, nearly knocking her over.

        &quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day, everyone,&quot; Sasami beamed, the young girl 
rolling a tray full of goodies out of the kitchen. Cupcakes, chocolate 
and mini-cakes covered the tray, soon being passed out to various 
girlfriends.

        &quot;Makes me glad Ayeka and I already exchanged gifts,&quot; Ryouko 
noted with a grin.

        &quot;Minagi,&quot; Sasami held up a carefully wrapped box, her cheeks 
faintly red, &quot;this is for you.&quot;

        Minagi smiled, taking it before gently kissing Sasami, &quot;Thank 
you.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; another voice murmured from behind Juri.

        Arisugawa Juri turned around, seeing Setsuna standing there with 
a gentle smile on her face. &quot;I guess you got your gift, huh?&quot; she 
smiled.

        Setsuna laughed, her long black hair flowing around her, &quot;Oh, 
yes.&quot; Her eyes twinkled with amusement as she continued, &quot;I know have 
several teachers wondering who sent me a dozen roses and a box of 
chocolate.&quot;

        &quot;Hope I didn&#39;t get you in trouble,&quot; Juri kissed her gently.

        &quot;I&#39;m out at work,&quot; Setsuna shrugged slightly. She smirked, &quot;And 
I&#39;ve had several teacher friends ask to meet you, too.&quot;

        There was movement over by the kareoke stage, and Juri blinked 
in surprise. The young woman who was climbing up there looked like Ami 
Mizuno, but very different, too. She was dressed in a boy&#39;s school 
uniform, the black costume going well with her dark blue hair. There was 
an aura of sorrow around her, and a angry red scar ran from beneath one 
eye, across the bridge of her nose, and under the other eye.

        &quot;Is that.. Ami?&quot; Juri finally asked.

        &quot;An alternate of her, yes,&quot; Setsuna agreed softly.

        &quot;What happened to her?&quot; Juri asked softly.

        &quot;She lost so much,&quot; Setsuna said softly, &quot;and has forced herself 
to carry on.&quot; She looked over at Juri, &quot;I had best get my own 
alternate.&quot; With a few softly spoken words she became Sailor Pluto, then 
with Time staff in hand she simply disappeared.

        &quot;Tell the mothers and the babes, tell the old and the sick they 
will be safe,
        Get the young males, tell them to be brave...
        I was so concerned with saving lives
        I never saw you pull the knife!

        High on the mountains, across seven seas
        Answer the question,
        Why me.. why me?&quot;

        Ami sang in a voice that was filled with pain and loss, stilling 
conversations all across the room. She finished, sliding the microphone 
back into it&#39;s stand, her eyes glittering with unshed tears. She stepped 
down from the stage, swaying drunkenly, then stumbled forward.

        &quot;I have you,&quot; the other Setsuna caught Ami gently, cradling her 
in her arms. The expression on her face was tender, touched by the pain 
within the other woman.

        &quot;Take her home,&quot; Sailor Pluto said softly. She looked down at 
the drunken Ami with compassion, &quot;I suspect she has drank enough not to 
remember tonight.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you for calling me,&quot; Setsuna smiled wryly. The crowd 
cleared the way as they walked towards the exit, leaving into the chill 
February day.

        &quot;Poor thing,&quot; Hitomi murmured as they went by the brown haired 
greeter.

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Excel agreed, the blonde looking oddly introspective.

        &quot;Excel sempai...&quot; Hyatt limply collapsed on a nearby chair, the 
black haired girl looking up at her weakly.

        Excel perked up, &quot;Back to work! For the greater glory of 
Arisugawa!&quot;

        &quot;Ah, the benefits of a short attention span,&quot; Keiko noted as the 
two raced by, her long brown hair flowing down her back in a braid.

        &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; May chuckled softly, the brown haired cyberdoll in 
the maid&#39;s uniform smiling as they danced closely together.

        Another couple swept by, dressed in uniforms that were 
remarkably alike. Utena wore her traditional school uniform, black with 
a pink trim, but Anthy wore her mirror image. The uniform was a soft 
rose, patterned exactly like Utena&#39;s but edged in black.

        &quot;You look lovely,&quot; Utena murmured softly. A slight smile, &quot;What 
inspired the change?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not the rose bride,&quot; Anthy said, &quot;but I still possess 
certain powers and abilities. As foolish as it sounds, with power comes 
responsibility.&quot;

        &quot;You know about my fighting youma..?&quot; Utena said, a flush to her 
cheeks.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Anthy said, &quot;and I intend to fight by your side.&quot;

        Utena drew her close, the two moving gently to the sound of the 
music. &quot;Are you going to call yourself something unique?&quot; she asked 
softly.

        Anthy smiled shyly, &quot;Bara no Senshi.&quot;

        &quot;Soldier of Roses,&quot; Utena said softly. She bent her head, 
bringing their lips together in a gentle kiss, &quot;It suits you.&quot;

        &quot;You know Tony,&quot; Sylia Stingray said as she walked with her 
brown haired girlfriend to a table, &quot;this is a really odd club.&quot;

        &quot;Interesting, though,&quot; Antonia &#39;Tony&#39; Stark said with a grin. 
Her brown hair fell into her eyes as she leaned forward to kiss Sylia, 
&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s day.&quot;

        &quot;I hope you liked your chocolates,&quot; Sylia finally separated them 
reluctantly.

        &quot;Once I got past them to find the top of my desk,&quot; Tony chuckled 
softly. She smiled as she pulled something out from her pocket, &quot;My gift 
to you is somewhat smaller.&quot;

        Sylia blinked at the box in surprise, her eyes widening as Tony 
popped it open to reveal the diamond ring inside. &quot;You don&#39;t mean...&quot;

        Tony took the ring from the box, slipping it on Sylia&#39;s finger. 
A gentle smile, &quot;I&#39;m not proposing, but... I want to share the rest of 
my life with you.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; and Sylia pulled her into another kiss.
