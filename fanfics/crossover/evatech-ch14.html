<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 14 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/evatech-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>A suddenly blooming fireball signaled the destruction of yet another 
battlepod as the variable fighter Evangelion soared through the blast. 
The brown haired young woman sitting in the pilot&#39;s seat studied her 
heads up display for a moment then began to curse softly.

Hikaru Horaki scowled to herself as she radioed her wingmen to demand, 
&quot;All right guys, where are you now?&quot;

A few seconds later a blonde haired young man looked at her sheepishly 
as his face appeared on the screen, the similarly designed fighter plane 
settling in beside her as they soared across the battlefield. &quot;Sorry,&quot; 
Aida pushed his glasses up under his helmet, &quot;we got kinda hung up back 
there.&quot;

The other boy had darker brown hair and a cocky smile on his face as his 
fighter slid into place on the other side. &quot;We needed to save some of 
our fellow pilots,&quot; Toji boasted.

&quot;More like they saved us,&quot; Aida muttered.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Toji protested.

&quot;Break it up you two,&quot; Hikaru said to them firmly, &quot;we&#39;ve got work to 
do.&quot; She smiled to herself sadly as memories came to haunt her, thinking 
about how they had been ordinary schoolmates way back when. Then the war 
came to Japan, they went to a recruitment office and discovered that all 
three of them had the skills needed to be a pilot.

&quot;You all right?&quot; Aida asked her, peering at her worriedly.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Hikaru softly reassured him. There was a sudden alarm on 
their status screens and she growled softly, noting the breakthrough in 
their lines. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; she commanded them, &quot;it looks like things are 
getting lively again.&quot;

&quot;Next time let&#39;s get out here when the Angels of Death are around,&quot; Aida 
said with a slight smile, &quot;things are always quieter with them on 
patrol.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t need those three,&quot; Toji scoffed.

Hikaru didn&#39;t answer, all her attention focused on her viewscreen. 
Still, she had to admit that Aida was right, the Zentradi really didn&#39;t 
like facing the three aces known as the Angels of Death, Asuka, Rei and 
Shinji. &quot;You&#39;d better be enjoying your night off,&quot; she muttered.

The three Evangelion shifted almost as one being, the fighters swiftly 
reconfiguring into the EVA mode, semi-humanoid warriors of frightening 
power. Their railguns boomed as they fired, spent shells falling towards 
the sea far below as the three drove back an enemy asault.

On the bridge Ritsuko monitored the ongoing battle, the blonde haired 
officer&#39;s gaze intense on the screen. &quot;We&#39;re holding the fighter assault 
back with minimal losses,&quot; she reported, &quot;and several Zentradi battle 
cruisers are holding a parallel course to observe.&quot;

Misato looked like she was fast asleep, the black captain&#39;s hat she 
usually wore pulled down over her eyes as she lounded in her chair. The 
black haired woman&#39;s voice was crystal clear, however, as she crisply 
asked them, &quot;And what about the Angels?&quot;

&quot;No Angel units have been reported by the pilots,&quot; Ritsuko answered.

Maya spoke up from her tactical station before she could even be asked 
the question, &quot;While our sensors can&#39;t perfectly distinguish between the 
normal enemy units and Angels, it appears that there aren&#39;t any out 
there.&quot;

&quot;So why aren&#39;t they using them?&quot; Misato pushed herself up a bit in her 
chair to look out the viewport at the bursts of light flaring in the 
sky, each one a dying pilot.

Makoto spoke up from his station to offer a theory, &quot;Well, maybe they 
have much less of those suits than we thought?&quot;

&quot;Or they&#39;re just holding them back for somekind of final assault,&quot; 
Ritsuko said seriously.

&quot;You always say the most reassuring things,&quot; Misato said with a scowl. 
She looked thoughtful, &quot;The enemy cruisers?&quot;

Ritsuko blinked then turned back to her console, &quot;Still holding their 
distance.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s time we reminded them that we have some teeth,&quot; Misato said 
with a dangerous little smile. &quot;Ready the main gun,&quot; she commanded, 
&quot;target those cruisers.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Maya squeaked as the bridge crew set to work.

The massive starship began to shift, segments moving as different 
components were brought together to combine the systems. Looking oddly 
humanoid the SDF-1 reared up, aircraft carrier arms extended, thrusters 
from it&#39;s engine legs holding it aloft. Twin bows dropperd into place on 
the shoulders, directed towards where the cruisers observed.

&quot;Modular transformation completed,&quot; Ritsuko reported the facts crisply, 
&quot;the main gun is active and ready to fire on your command.&quot;

Between the massive bows a energy began to built. It began with a soft 
glow around each of the massive structures, then bolts of lightning 
began to dance between them. Brighter and brighter it grew, a powerful 
magnetic bottle holding the energy back.

&quot;Fighter commanders report that all Evengelion are clear of the firing 
radius,&quot; Maya said, her expression deadly serious.

&quot;Fire!&quot; Misato commanded.

Maya firmly pressed down on the big red button, the power that had been 
so carefully built up simply unleashed in a focused direction. The 
cruisers saw it coming, slowly attempting to turn but it was simply too 
late. The wave of destructive fire washed over all of them and no matter 
how good their armor was it couldn&#39;t stand against it.

&quot;Sensors confirm the destruction of all targets,&quot; Maya said softly. She 
looked shaken, the sudden destruction of the Zentradi vessels filling 
them all with a mix of awe and fear. A gentle hand was set on hers and 
Maya met Ritsuko&#39;s sympathetic gaze.

Makoto&#39;s voice was relieved as he reported, &quot;The remaining battlepods 
are pulling out, disengaging from our Evangelion fighters.&quot;

&quot;Keep us in combat mode for the next hour,&quot; Misato commanded, &quot;I don&#39;t 
want the Zentradi thinking we&#39;re just a one shot wonder.&quot;

&quot;What about the city?&quot; Ritsuko asked curiously, referring to the entire 
city that the SDF-1 carried in it&#39;s massive belly.

&quot;They&#39;re used to this sort of thing by now,&quot; Misato said optimistically 
before adding, &quot;besides, what could go wrong?&quot;

Deep within the heart of the SDF-1 Minmei sighed tiredly as the Chinese 
beauty muttered, &quot;Look at the mess you&#39;ve gotten us into.&quot;

&quot;But I didn&#39;t,&quot; Shinji started to say only to trail off with a sigh, 
looking around the pit that the three of them were trapped in. They had 
rushed for a safety zone as the ship reshaped itself but were caught up 
in moving segments until they ended up in here.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Miriya asked them, the green haired young woman looking 
around her with honest curiosity.

&quot;The ship had to transform,&quot; Shinji sighed, the brown haiored boy 
continuing on, &quot;probably to fire the main cannons.&quot;

&quot;Wonder how long we&#39;ll be stuck here?&quot; Minmei asked, looking around them 
at the massive walls disappearing into the distance.

&quot;Who knows,&quot; Shinji shrugged. He noticed Minmei shivering slightly and 
pulled his jacket off to drape it over her shoulders.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Minmei smiled up at the young man greatfully.

&#39;I will never understand these beings,&#39; Miriya thought irritably, 
feeling a uncomfortable sensation in her stomach as she watched. Finally 
she had to ask, &quot;And the cannon can not be fired without the 
transformation?&quot;

Shinji actually blushed slightly, keeping his distance from Minmei. &quot;We 
lost segments of the ship&#39;s interior during the first major space fold,&quot; 
he explained uncomfortably, &quot;the transformation is the only way to link 
the various pieces of the cannon together.&quot;

&quot;I never knew that,&quot; Minmei admitted.

&#39;And to think we wondered why they weren&#39;t using their weapons,&#39; Miriya 
thought, the Zentradi officer taking a seat against one of the walls, 
&#39;when in fact they couldn&#39;t.&#39;

&quot;Miriya&#39;s got the right idea,&quot; Shinji said as he sat down too, &quot;there&#39;s 
not much we can do until the ship reverts back to normal.&quot;

Minmei settled down beside him, the young woman snuggling in warmly 
there by Shinji. &quot;I just hate waiting here without doing anything,&quot; she 
gave Shinji a little smile.

&#39;No,&#39; Miriya thought to herself, fighting off the feeling of being 
physically ill from watching them, &#39;I will never understand these 
beings.&#39;</pre>
