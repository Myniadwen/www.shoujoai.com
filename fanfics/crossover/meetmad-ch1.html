<h1>Noir, Meet Madlax (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelsorrow.html">Angel of Sorrow</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Angel: Well, someone had to do it!

----------

Beep.

&quot;Looks like we have an assignment, Kirika,&quot; Mireille Bouquet said.

&quot;Who is it this time?&quot;

Mireille squinted, &quot;Some guy named Jean Jacques Rousseau.&quot;

Kirika paused, &quot;Uh. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong but, isn&#39;t he some writer 
from around the time of the Enlightenment?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I guess he&#39;s his great, great, great, great&#151;&quot;

Five minutes later.

&quot;&#151;great, great grandson or something. Of course, give or take a few 
great&#39;s.&quot;

The young woman made a doubting look, &quot;Okay. So, what does he do?&quot;

&quot;Well, it says here that he&#39;s from some country called Nafrece, and 
writes a lot of revealing stuff about the criminal underworld. He also 
wrote something about three books and an ancient language,&quot; she added 
nonchalantly. &quot;Obviously, a lot of crime syndicates want him dead for 
the former, and some organization called Enfant for the latter,&quot; 
Mireille clicked her mouse a couple times and continued reading the 
information to herself.

&quot;When do we leave?&quot; Kirika asked.

&quot;Tomorrow. So get your things ready.&quot;

Meanwhile...

&quot;My darling Chloe, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to send you out again,&quot; came the 
calm voice of a woman, &quot;You have to travel to Nafrece and kill the man 
named Jean Jacques Rousseau.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Altena,&quot; Chloe thought for a moment, &quot;Isn&#39;t that the name of a guy 
from the Enlightenment?&quot;

&quot;Yes he is. But this is a different man,&quot; Altena responded. There was a 
slight pause, &quot;He&#39;s a lot more handsome.&quot;

Chloe gagged a bit. She swore she heard a bit of a swoon coming out of 
her mother figure. &quot;What does he look like?&quot;

Altena passed her a picture of Jean, looking like she was about to 
faint. As Chloe gazed at it, she nearly gagged again. How could anyone 
like this guy? He was a brown-haired man who looked about 5&#39;9&quot;. He had a 
faint hint of a beard growing on a very strong looking chin. His blue 
eyes were almost as dark as the deepest oceans, and if one tried to look 
in them, they would get lost. In this particular picture Jean wore a 
very distinct smirk, which just added to his charm.

&quot;Man, he&#39;s ugly,&quot; Chloe commented.

&quot;That&#39;s &#39;cause you&#39;re not straight.&quot;

The next day...

&quot;Wow, so this is Nafrece,&quot; Kirika said, quite amazed. &quot;It&#39;s way too 
peaceful.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Maybe we should go here for our honeymo&#151;&quot; Mireille caught 
herself.

&quot;What?&quot; the Japanese girl asked.

&quot;Uh, nothing. It&#39;s nothing. Just- just nothing,&quot; The blond tried to 
explain, doing her best not to think about her fantasy. She cleared her 
throat, &quot;Let&#39;s find a place to stay.&quot; And so they started wandering the 
streets.

Soon afterwards, a very out of breath and dirty looking Chloe emerged 
from a nearby alley. The paw of a hairy creature shot out of it, 
attempting to grab anything close. It roared, nearly breaking the 
windows of buildings.

Chloe muttered, &quot;Shortcut my ass, Altena.&quot; She dusted her cloak off and 
then her bodysuit, where a paper airplane had fallen out.

My Darling Chloe,

It was a shortcut. If you hadn&#39;t taken it, you&#39;d be walking around for 
an extra three days.&#151;

&quot;At least I wouldn&#39;t be nearly eaten!&quot;

&#151;Anyway, if you look to your left, you should see the child and her 
friend searching for a place to stay. Go to them and show them the 
apartment next to that Burton mansion.

Love,

Altena

Following her instructions, Chloe spotted the two other women on her 
left. Kind of freaked out that Altena told her exactly where they were, 
she stopped to think. How the hell does she know this stuff? What, does 
she have a GPS or something? Or worldwide surveillance cameras? Chloe 
then saw a mysterious man clad in a black suit and sunglasses in another 
alleyway. Oh. She shrugged and approached Mireille and Kirika from 
behind.

Sensing a disturbance in her wide personal space, Kirika turned around 
sharply and pointed her gun. Mireille did the same and looked quite 
surprised, &quot;Chloe? What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m on the same mission as you. And&#151;ow!&quot; A paper airplane had poked her 
leg. Chloe sighed and opened it.

My Darling Chloe,

Don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re on the same mission as them. And remember: You. 
Are. Working. WITH. Them. Don&#39;t be all selfish and keep the information 
to yourself. Let them be in on this one.

Love,

Altena

P.S. Don&#39;t forget to let them stay with you! And just say to them 
exactly what this letter says.

The magenta-haired teenager sighed again and repeated Altena&#39;s words, 
&quot;Alright look. I&#39;m on the same mission as you. And I&#39;ll be working 
alongside you. I won&#39;t be selfish and keep the information to myself. 
I&#39;ll let you two be in on this one. And. Altena got us an apartment to 
stay in for the remainder of our time here.&quot;

&quot;Huh. That made things a lot easier,&quot; Mireille said as both she and 
Kirika lowered their weapons.

&quot;So, where is this apartment?&quot; Kirika asked.

&quot;Just follow me.&quot;

Angel: Hah. Ahah. I was originally going to make this only one chapter, 
but I can never seem to get it right. This story shouldn&#39;t take too 
long, though.</pre>
