<pre>(Rack)
Life of a magic dealer in Sunnydale was certainly a happy one. All 
those petty individuals and lost souls with so much power and no idea 
what to do with it. Daily dozens of clients came and wanted their 
dose to take their weak souls away from reality into a higher sphere 
and yet they stayed blind to the true bliss of it all. Receiving was 
one thing but giving and taking at the same time, the sweet taste of 
their essence, their raw power and untapped potential that was the 
real thing. Power was my game and I loved it, in a way it was my own 
addiction.
	And then there was Strawberry. Rarely before had I come 
across such vast, untapped potential, so much fire crackling under 
her skin just waiting to be released. She could be so much, she could 
shape the whole world in her hands and to her liking, she could clean 
the whole Hellmouth from any evil but herself if she wished and 
sealing it in the process. Instead she occupied herself with petty 
rituals, simply assisting the slayer and practicing a limiting 
religion. In a way she was the most naive of my customers. Strawberry 
was aware of what I was doing to her and at the same time not.
	I chuckled, knowing that she hadn&#39;t used the power I gave 
her. The strain of channeling everything out was written clearly all 
over her, body and aura. Such a waste. She had no idea how things 
really worked. What magic was all about and that if she wanted it the 
fact that it was Black Magic would mean as much as a cent in a 
mountain of gold. All was about control actually. Only if you lacked 
that magic would direct the path of your fate.
	Strawberry, however, was a mere child, a baby in the world of 
giants all around her. Her power equaled and excelled those around 
her but she didn&#39;t know what to do with it or how to properly do so. 
A pity but at the same time I had the most of it. It was like playing 
with fire. I knew if she exploded and finally turned against me I 
would be lucky to get out of here alive but as long as I kept it safe 
and in control, my own desires were met perfectly. This way...
	My thoughts were rudely interrupted and I had only a split 
second to react when I felt the nearly impenetrable shields around my 
operation base crumble like paper under fire. And that is what 
happened. Blue tongues of flame suddenly slashed through the walls 
around me as a deafening boom set free a raging inferno. Screams 
could be heard from the waiting room but I put them no mind. My 
customers were the least of my concerns now as I instantly pulled up 
a tight heat shield around me and strode to the already melted door.
	Stepping over its remains and avoiding the lashing fire all 
around me, I felt my anger rise inside of me until it was almost at 
the boiling point. Whoever dared this was going to pay. It had cost a 
lot of financial as well as magical investment to set up this place 
and would cost even more to rebuild. When I entered the waiting room, 
however, I froze, not quite certain I really saw what my eyes tried 
to tell me. The door was practically blasted to bits - not by the 
fire per se - and standing proudly and with a burning passion in her 
eyes that was more lethal than the actual flames around me was a 
person of my past and hadn&#39;t thought to ever see again. To be honest 
I had thought her long since dead. I fixed the figure with a 
disbelieving stare, taking in the red, fiery hair and flashing ruby 
eyes, the anger radiating in them and even though I managed to keep 
my cool outwardly, I was shaken and terrified to the core on the 
inside because I knew that Strawberry was a laugh compared to her...

(Tara)
The house was in a straining quiet at the moment. A few minutes ago I 
had heard hushed voices filtering upstairs, probably Xander and Anya 
demanding to be let in on the situation. Although I couldn&#39;t sense or 
hear the ex-demon anywhere. I wasn&#39;t trying though, simply 
concentrated on my unconscious mate and - with a sliver of hope - 
maybe lover again cradled in her best friends arms as we made our way 
upstairs. The part of me that was always worried over my friends well-
being wanted to at least make sure that everyone was alright and that 
Dawn wasn&#39;t too freaked by the whole thing. But my heart had set 
priorities right now. And so I had wordlessly slipped into the... our 
bed behind Willow, taking over the right to hold her.
	That was some minutes ago and the voices from downstairs had 
stopped now, basking the house in a blanket of silence that was as 
much relaxing as it was nerve-retching. After all the stress and 
strain of lending Willow power in order to sustain her spirit I was 
exhausted beyond anything I had ever experienced before. Doing 
powerful spells and being drained afterwards was one thing but this 
had been way intense. I would not have traded it though if it meant 
that Willow lived and there was now hope for a new chance. Tried as I 
might though I could not get my raging mind to calm down enough to 
get some much needed sleep.
	I had come so close to lose Willow and the thought alone 
could not be bared. I knew for a long time that I was depended on 
her, needed her as much a human being needed to breathe. That time 
apart had been torture, self-inflicted torture that might be 
understandable on a certain level but was also needless and selfish 
on another. Was independence really that important? Was the freedom 
of my mind worth leaving a part of my heart behind? I did not know 
for sure anymore? Yes, the violation was wrong, the motives selfish 
and abusive but should I not have seen through it? If I really loved 
and deserved her love should I not have stayed and pulled her through 
this? What was a little sacrifice for our love? I had no answer for 
those questions and still couldn&#39;t decide what should have been done 
and what not. Important was that we were here now, together, save, 
alive and hopefully recovering.
	Willow shook and whimpered in her sleep and I brought my arms 
more tightly around her. &quot;Tara, Buffy, no!&quot; I could feel a surge of 
power, something dark and primal and even though I knew it was an 
unconscious reaction of her essence to the illusion created by the 
nightmare, I had to resist the fear of that stained magic. I would 
not shy away anymore, Willow needed my support right now.
	&quot;Shh, it&#39;s okay, baby, I&#39;m here.&quot; She calmed down a little 
but was still tense and curled up against me in a fetal position. I 
felt the tears unbidden in my eyes but movement from the door kept my 
attention focused there. Buffy had returned upstairs and was taking 
in the scene with a sad, guilty look. From the talks of the last days 
I knew exactly what was going through her and most of the guilt came 
not from the blame on what happened to her best friend but what 
little she probably felt about it.
	Her soul is unattached, Willow&#39;s words came back with 
relentless force and I quelled the urge to look away in rising shame. 
Instead I managed to stop her already in the process of turning with 
a barely whispered but pleading: &quot;No.&quot; The Slayer turned uncertain, 
hovering in the same space for a few seconds as I tried to bring my 
message across without words. When it became clear that Buffy&#39;s 
insecurities didn&#39;t help with that at all. I called out 
softly: &quot;Stay.&quot;
	The blonde&#39;s eyes widened for the fraction of a second but I 
managed to hold her gaze until her features soften. Buffy let the 
door close behind her and without another needed word slid under the 
covers. She stayed on her side for awhile but after some time we were 
comfortably snuggled up against each other and soon sound asleep.

(Anya)
As we strode into the dealer&#39;s lair I took in anything around me 
while most of my attention was still directed at Lina. I knew she was 
from the old world, her magic use alone had been a giveaway. But this 
part had been sealed off for as long as I was a demon. Daryial&#39;s 
appearance had startled me but he could have been outside back then. 
This one though... Everything in her aura practically SMELLED liked 
home. It was an ability I hadn&#39;t really used in a millennia as well 
but one that was not so easily lost. If that wasn&#39;t enough already, 
her power was far greater than mine had ever been in my prime. And 
back then I was considered one of the strongest, human mages. A power 
and status that would certainly take some time to rebuild. Lina&#39;s 
aura though was vivid, throbbing with barely restrained power that 
could strike a lethal blow any second. Rack would stand no chance 
against that. And I think he knew it.
	&quot;Scarlet?&quot; The dealer stopped upon entering the lobby, 
obviously unaffected by the intense heat around us. I could hear the 
wonder in his voice and gathered instantly that there had, 
apparently, been history between the two. A fact that often played 
into Rack&#39;s hands as I know from dealing with his case once but this 
time I was sure that wouldn&#39;t be a comfort the dealer.
	&quot;Rack,&quot; Lina regarded him with nothing but disdain, her voice 
dripping acid. I had to shudder and was inwardly glad not be the one 
on the receiving end of her anger. She seemed so calm and collected 
dealing with Willow back then - from what little I witnessed after 
arriving late with Xander - but now it was as if someone had set free 
a wild and quite deadly animal. Emotional scars, I surmised, that 
would explain it and I was rather sure that was the case anyway. A 
lover probably, maybe lost to Rack or something differently. I had 
seen it before but let us just say that Willow wasn&#39;t the only person 
who almost lost the one important to them. And in my case 
the &quot;almost&quot; had been painfully missing...
	No, time for that now. Lina and Rack were standing opposite 
of each other, both judging the others strength and intentions. While 
the latter didn&#39;t need much interpretation, I could safely attest the 
aura of confidence around the redhead while the slightest quiver of 
fear shone through the dealer&#39;s fa&ccedil;ade. &quot;Really? Did you have to
make 
such a mess? This place costs, you know, and I&#39;m sure that we could 
have settled this petty difference otherwise. I would have even given 
you one for free...&quot; The rest of the arrogant speech intended to 
cover his own dread was cut of by a blazing arrow narrowly missing 
his head. I could not help myself but smirk.
	&quot;This has gone too far, Rack. My assigned charge was almost 
killed tonight. I despised your shady business before this already 
but now you crossed a line. Pulling an unwilling soul purposefully 
into oblivion is something I cannot just overlook. I would have just 
liked to have her away from you but it is obvious that you won&#39;t even 
give her a chance.&quot; As expected Rack was puzzled for a moment, before 
his eyes lit up and he unexpectedly chuckled . &quot;Oh, this is about 
Strawberry.&quot; A sudden laugh erupted from his throat and I really 
thought he had went insane. Maybe that wasn&#39;t far from the truth for 
almost all of his life... &quot;And you,&quot; he pointed at Lina again and 
then laughed once more, &quot;want to teach her? You can barely control 
yourself. How do you want to teach her that?&quot; Lina flung out her arm, 
palm pointed forward as a lance of power surged forward only to smash 
against an invisible barrier.
	&quot;I should have let you join your little sidekick when I had 
the chance.&quot; Rack quieted down at my voice and fixed with a bemused 
grin. &quot;Oh, Anyanka. I&#39;m hurt so little respect from a fellow...&quot; A 
Digu Volt smashed into his shield and pushed him back a few feet. &quot;I 
was never your fellow anything. I was a wish-granting vengeance 
demon. You are just a pathetic sick THING.&quot; Rack didn&#39;t seem fazed by 
that and I moved forward to further enforce my words but was held 
back by a hand suddenly blocking my path.
	I looked at Lina for a moment. Taking in that deep calm 
suddenly meeting me. There was still anger but it was shaped into a 
sharp, cold blade of lethal steel now, an almost freezing 
calculation. And I knew that whatever Rack had tried with his mocking 
and however deep it might have hurt, the effect surely was the 
opposite of what he had hoped for.
	Without a word I stepped back and silently retreated out the 
burning house. I could see Rack tense the barest bit as Lina stepped 
forward to face him. Backing away until I couldn&#39;t see them anymore I 
flew up to a low roof and waited. That wasn&#39;t actually a long 
process. Just half a minute later the ground shook in a low tremble 
and the already ruined house literally burst apart as two figures 
shot out of the flames. Both were illuminated in flaring red auras 
but where Racks was a deep, tainted crimson, Lina&#39;s was a mixture of 
ruby and scarlet with a bright fire. When the two began their deathly 
dance I made sure that I would have a defensive spell ready either 
for Lina or myself. Sunnydale was about to be the ground of a magic 
duel that could barely be compared to the fight of a Slayer with a 
Hell Goddes. And that we already had.

(Willow)
I woke with a soundless scream, my throat dry and soar. When had I 
been drinking or eating the last time? It seemed like days. Maybe it 
even was days. It was dark around me and I wasn&#39;t sure where exactly 
I was. The images of the nightmare came rushing back and only when I 
finally registered the feel of a soft, familiar body against my back 
did I relax somewhat, relief flooding through me.
	Goddess, that had been so surreal and yet I couldn&#39;t get it 
out of my head how right everything felt. Not right as in it should 
be that way but that it was that way, in fact really real... Ouch, my 
head hurt. No babbling in your head for awhile, Willow. I recalled 
that in the dream that guy I thought was distantly familiar shot down 
Buffy and Tara and there was so much blood and... I never wanted this 
too happen, would never let it happen, as long I lived...
	I was alive. The realization hit me full force and images, 
impressions from earlier came rushing back to me. Collapsing on the 
pavement of Revello Drive, near death and with the absolute certainty 
that I would indeed be dead soon. When there were Buffy and Tara. I 
had felt so loved when their energy surged through me. Safe like a 
baby in its mother&#39;s arms. The body behind me mumbled something 
incoherently and snuggled closer. A faint smile came to my lips and 
my heart leapt a little with the joy I felt that moment. She was 
there for me again. I didn&#39;t hazard any illusions that this was going 
to be an easy road, for both of us. There were a lot of negative 
emotions to sort through, a lot of consolation and amends to make. 
But I could have the relieve again that everything would turn out to 
be alright in the end. Somehow.
	I had no idea why I didn&#39;t notice it before but maybe I had 
been too focused on the nightmare and Tara but there was another body 
against mine that I couldn&#39;t quite make out. But I felt a head 
resting against my shoulder and it was strangely comforting. Years of 
sleepovers and the year as dorm mates helped to quickly identify the 
body to be Buffy&#39;s and another smile flashed briefly over my face in 
the darkness. Tara was here. Buffy was here. And we were all together 
and at peace for the moment. A rest and peace all of us deserved and 
actually needed.
	My mind wanted to wrap around the odd sleeping arrangement 
and the warmth I felt with both women on either side but my still 
rather drained and overall exhausted body was not up to it and soon I 
felt myself drifting back to sleep, relishing in the feel of my mate 
and best friend surrounding me. Completed in the odd dynamics of our 
individual relationships.
	I must have dozed of for a few minutes and while my body was 
showing no outward signs of being awake, my spirit suddenly jerked 
awake for a moment. My magic capacities might be running low, only 
sustained by Tara and Buffy&#39;s energy but I could recognize the echoes 
in the distance, loud and clear. Beside me I could feel Tara&#39;s spirit 
stir and even the Slayer reacted subconsciously. Levels of magic were 
just raised of a magnitude that were truly frightening. Black Magic 
and there was a lot of fire. Two, they were two. Was that Rack? Yes. 
And the other one seemed distantly familiar. The stranger from last 
mind made her way back through the haze of memories. They were 
fighting, it was more like a miniature war. My spirit boggled as 
particular spells clashed and mental shields slammed into place 
before it could become to overwhelming.
	I lay hovering between sleep and wake for awhile longer, 
trying to figure out what was wrong. But then the echoes quieted down 
and finally stopped in the distance, I drifted back into Morpheus&#39; 
arms, deciding that it could wait until tomorrow. Whatever happened, 
if it was dangerous for us when I would have been awake in a flash 
despite any physical protests.

(Lina)
Out of the corner of my eyes I saw Anya move away giving us the 
needed space. My gaze was fixed on the hated man in front of me and 
as anger began to fuel me from deep inside I began to 
chant. &quot;Darkness from twilight...&quot; Rack, I hated the name with a 
passion. It was when I was lost in my own addiction, though that time 
couldn&#39;t be compared at all with my new charge&#39;s. That was when he 
had found me. &quot;Crimson from blood that flows...&quot; He thought me to be 
weak and I was. Gone was the strong, confident sorceress of my youth. 
Life had betrayed me, brutally so, and I hadn&#39;t cared at that 
time. &quot;Buried in the flow of time...&quot; He took me in, amused himself 
for awhile and spat me out like Willow but as with Willow he hadn&#39;t 
gotten enough and drained me almost completely. It was then when 
Giles had found me, on the verge of death. &quot;In thy great name I 
pledge myself to darkness...&quot; Since he had moved from England shortly 
afterwards I had never been confronted with him again. Now he was 
doing the same thing again with Willow. Not over my dead body. &quot;Those 
who oppose us shall be destroyed by the power you and I posses!&quot;
	I cupped the glowing sphere of crimson and fixed Rack with a 
deathly glare. He had been bragging on about how he knew me so well 
and that I could never win against him. Well, he had only met the 
weak girl branded by tragedy, not the strong mage that had confronted 
powerful Mazoku and even slew one seventh of this world&#39;s Demon 
Lord. &quot;You know nothing about me, Rack. But you are about to find 
out; sadly it will be the last thing you experience... No wait, that 
isn&#39;t so sad after all. DRAGU SLAVE!&quot; And I let the most powerful 
spell known to everyone but me go.
	The dealer was so surprised that his half-hearted defense was 
washed away almost instantly. I knew though that he was made of 
sterner stuff when to be so easily defeated. Levitating up into the 
air I looked around carefully and was not being disappointed when 
Rack rose from the burning remains of his lair. Wiping the blood 
dripping from his bottom lip away his eyes narrowed. &quot;Alright. It 
seems that was a &#39;no&#39; to my offer.&quot; I did not even give him the 
benefit of staring at him hard. Instead I moved instantly. His eyes 
widened in surprise as I closed in quicker than he could 
react. &quot;FLARE LANCE!&quot; Rack dodged the spear formed by several fire 
arrows fused together but that was just a feint. One hand behind my 
back came suddenly shooting forward as I was almost above my 
enemy. &quot;BALUS ROD!&quot; A thin band of light crashed against his quickly 
brought up arm and proceeded to wrap around it. I tugged on the light 
whip and he was flung through the air and down on the roof of a 
building.
	I was not about to give him the time to recover. Landing on 
the roof I drew back the magic whip but got surprised when his hands 
suddenly were thrust out and a sizzling lightning bolt hit me in the 
shoulder while I tried to avoid the sudden attack. The grip on the 
spell lost, I rolled with the blow and came up half-kneeling one hand 
firmly place against the roof. &quot;DUG WAVE!&quot; The roof beneath my 
opponent exploded in a shockwave as the earth spell took effect but 
Rack was already airborne leaping back in a wide arc he came around 
with two small points of fiery lights on his hand and I immediately 
called out a Balus Wall to shield me from the two flames suddenly 
rushing for me.
	For a moment both of us halted, taking a few breaths. Not 
that I really needed it. &quot;Not bad,&quot; Rack admitted with a cockiness 
that I knew was a mask. He was scared, terrified actually, I could 
almost smell it. &quot;I know now why you always were so special to me. A 
pity we can&#39;t settle this like adults.&quot;
	&quot;Shut up, Rack. I had enough of your delusions. This town is 
not big enough for the both of us. Leave here and never EVER cross my 
path again. If not, you should bow to the crowd now because you&#39;re 
about to leave the show.&quot; Of course the unworthy idiot wasn&#39;t clever. 
Pride prevented him from following his logical mind that knew he 
couldn&#39;t win. &quot;Spare me the moral lecture, Scarlet. You are no better 
than me or Strawberry. I bet your pretty, little princess would be 
disgusted with what...&quot;
	&quot;BLAST ASH!&quot; He leapt clear of the black void dropping in on 
him like a meteor with automatic targeting, barely. His left leg got 
scarred in the process which didn&#39;t seriously stop him. However, that 
last comment had served to snap the last string keeping my own rage 
in check. How DARE he speak about Lia like that?
	Coming together in a furious exchange of spells and 
occasionally physical blows I was quickly able to drive him back, 
flung him from the roof and smashed him into another wall with a well 
placed barrage of fireballs. A red haze of rage was covering my 
vision but I didn&#39;t care as I prepared for another Dragu Slave to 
finish the offending taint from my past once and for all.
	Buried under all this anger I had forgotten the basic rule of 
surviving for a sorceress. NEVER lose control in a fight with an 
equal opponent. And as much as I hated him Rack did come close to an 
equal opponent. Not quite but most of it he made up by his knowledge 
about me. Which he just wonderfully demonstrated, driving me into a 
rage with just a few pointed comments. Thus I was totally unprepared 
for the blinding flare that hit me, making me lose control over the 
spell, almost grilling myself in the process.
	&quot;WIND SHIELD!&quot; I could actually feel when a surely lethal 
energy bolt exploded against the spiritual barrier. I glanced up and 
saw Anya standing on a nearby roof, her hand outstretched ready to 
launch another spell. Her eyes suddenly got really wide and my head 
whipped around as I felt a huge gathering of magic. It was Rack. Oh 
shit! The guy was desperate. Obviously he HAD admitted to himself 
that there was no way he could win but instead of giving up he had 
saved up all his reserves, down to the last ounce of life-force in 
his body. All of this was gathered now in a warping and hissing 
corona of blackness all around him.
	He must have taken all those hits to partially absorb some of 
my spell&#39;s power, I realized while my mind turned into a whirlwind, 
trying to find a counter. At least a dozen spells and actions were 
discarded, during which Rack was beginning to be engulfed by the vast 
blackness. By the time Anya landed next to me and was trying to get 
me away the magic dealer was complete wrapped into a cocoon of pure 
darkness. Almost like... Aha!
	&quot;YOU MAY BE STRONGER THAN I BUT YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE 
ALIVE!&quot; L-sama, do they always have to boom like this? That is more 
annoying and distracting than the actual power. &quot;You wish,&quot; I 
muttered and shoved Anya behind me. The sphere of blackness began to 
expand and I rushed forward in what must have looked like an attempt 
of suicide. Drawing on my reserves I quickly chanted the boosting 
spell to activate my blood talismans. When the first phrase of the 
incantation left my lips a thick energy beam leapt from what had once 
been a human shape.
	&quot;Oh Lord of the Darkness and Four Worlds, I beseech thy 
fragments; by all the power thou possesseth...&quot; I could have cast an 
enhanced Dragu Slave. That would have protected me along with Rack 
and Anya in the eye of the storm... That is if I have wanted the 
backlash to not only level Sunnydale but sent an earthquake along the 
west coast that would be mentioned in the history books a thousand 
years from here. Brutal and naked power was not always the answer.
	&quot;... grant the heavens&#39; wrath to my hand; unleash the sword 
of dark, freezing nothingness...&quot; The sphere of an infinite void 
bypassing even that of the dealer&#39;s aura was slowly beginning to 
shift and form into a new shape between my hands. It grew larger, 
more defined and yet not. &quot;... by our power, our combined might... &quot;A 
blade, but the edges were blurry, constantly in motion and never 
solid. &quot;... let us walk as one along the path of destruction!&quot; The 
lethal beam was almost upon me as I brought my arms up and cried out 
the final words to ignite my strongest spell save for one that I 
prayed never to be forced to cast again.
	&quot;LAGUNA BLADE!&quot;
	The last emotion that Rack, powerful wizard and shady magic 
dealer, experienced before the blade of naked chaos parted his self-
destructive attack in two and before it slashed right through the 
practically impenetrable shield of magic around him was utter 
disbelief.

(Dawn)
Everything was silent in the house as I tiptoed down the stairs to 
the kitchen. Awoken for the third time this night I had decided to 
get something to drink and maybe to eat before trying to sleep again. 
I wished I could have contributed more to this night&#39;s crisis, then I 
would probably be as spent as the girls. Worry had practically eaten 
me alive, along with the feeling of helplessness. Sometimes I really 
wished I could be more than just &quot;the kid that everyone has to 
protect&quot;. I&#39;m almost sixteen for God&#39;s sake, Buffy had been slaying 
by this time already.
	I slipped past the couch, not wanting to wake the stranger 
who had introduced himself as Daryial, a friend of Anya&#39;s though it 
disturbed me that the ex-demon knew a dragon and never had mentioned 
it... The house was becoming more and more crowded lately and Mom 
would probably get a fit when she knew how many people came and left 
on a frequent basis. Tonight room had actually become an issue. With 
the newcomer and the girl who would obviously stay as well... I had 
promptly shushed off Xander to take Buffy&#39;s room. Since she was out 
cold in Willow and Tara&#39;s bed she couldn&#39;t say anything. I suppose it 
was a magic thing or something, it better be a magic thing. I didn&#39;t 
want my sister messing up the chances of my two favorite witches 
getting back together. And just a picture of all three of them... Eww!
	&quot;Huh?&quot; The couch was empty as I noticed now. Cold too. Anya&#39;s 
friend must have been gone already, maybe to look for her and the 
other girl. Shrugging my shoulders I got myself a glass of apple 
juice and set down at the kitchen table.  I doubted sleep would come 
so easily. So maybe I should sit here for awhile, calm my mind and 
such things... As if this every works when it should.
	&quot;Hey, Dawn, can&#39;t sleep either?&quot; Xander&#39;s voice came from the 
kitchen entrance and I looked up to see him standing just there, 
looking probably as bad I did. I gave him a weak smile. &quot;Nah. Too 
much on my mind.&quot; He trotted over and got himself something to drink 
as well. &quot;Yeah, kinda gets you freaked when you have no idea what is 
going on, you know?&quot; I confirmed with a nod that I indeed knew.
	There was silence for a few moments as we quietly nibbled on 
our drinks. I glanced over cautiously and corrected my earlier 
assumption. He looked far worse than I felt or could ever look. Next 
to the confusion deep lines of worry were showing. Reaching out with 
one hand, I took one of his and squeezed briefly. &quot;I&#39;m sure Anya is 
alright. This girl seemed to know what she was doing.&quot; I wasn&#39;t even 
sure what she had been doing, only that it was some kind of magic. 
Xander looked at me and in the light of the dim kitchen lamp I could 
have sworn that a brief look of fear flickered over his face. &quot;That&#39;s 
not that I&#39;m worried about. She...&quot; He trailed off and I thought that 
was some adult stuff again, that I wasn&#39;t supposed to know. Well, I 
wouldn&#39;t be giving ground on this. &quot;What?&quot; I pressed, fixing him with 
a stare which Xander completely ignored since he was looking down.
	Finally the young man who had always been more of an actual 
friend to me when the others heaved a sigh. &quot;I was on my way here 
when some vamps attacked. If Anya hadn&#39;t flown by and practically 
scorched them I would have been meat by now.&quot; Eww, bad visual, Xand-
man... Wait a minute! &quot;What do you mean with scorched?&quot; I couldn&#39;t 
quite imagine Anya carrying a torch or something around and with 
what... &quot;Magic. Some kind of heavy, flashy lightning spell. Burnt 
them alive.&quot; Oh. &quot;Oh,&quot; I said aloud. A moment later the rest sunk in. 
Oh my god!
	I might be a teenager still but I am by no means dumb. I 
didn&#39;t have a relationship yet but got a lot of experience from 
watching those around me already. &quot;You are worried that whatever her 
sudden burst in magic means might alienate you from her.&quot; Xander 
looked up again sharply and stared at me surprised and maybe even a 
little proud, before dropping his head back down. &quot;Yes, Dawn. Exactly 
that.&quot;

(Anya)
A sharp wind whistled through the narrow alley, carrying the smell of 
burnt and charged air away. Other than the sounds of ragged breathing 
and the wind the area was bathed in creepy silence. I still stood 
where I did a minute or more ago, hands half-outstretched in a vain 
attempt to protect us from Rack&#39;s suicide attack. It had become 
unnecessary. Frighteningly unnecessary. My eyes were glued on the 
figure kneeling on the ground, the power around her was slowly 
discharging as she channeled it back to... wherever it came from. 
This hadn&#39;t be a simple spell after all. Had this even been a spell?
	L-sama, she was POWERFUL! What I had witnessed would have 
been deemed impossible for a mere human in my time. Those were powers 
that rivaled, maybe even surpassed that of a Mazoku. The spell, that 
Laguna Blade, was pure chaos. Energy taken directly from the Sea. It 
called upon the highest source of Black Magic and that alone was an 
achievement that called for the title of a Master Mage. And there I 
thought I had been good in the old days...
	Finally Lina stood up and brushed off her clothing. The thick 
cloak and typical clothing of a travelling mage seemed somewhat out 
of place in this part of the world. Lina moaned audibly and rubbed 
her temples. &quot;Haven&#39;t done that in a long time. I almost forgot how 
much that takes out of you.&quot; She looked up at me and grinned, posing 
dramatically. &quot;Impressed?&quot; I simply nodded, not trusting my voice yet.
	The sound of flapping wings snapped me out of my shocked 
state. I glanced upwards to see Daryial making his descent, morphing 
back into human form and levitating the rest into the narrow back 
alley. &quot;I see,&quot; he said with a look towards Lina, &quot;that you succeeded 
in bringing down the sorcerer.&quot; Lina rolled her eyes. &quot;As if there 
was ever any doubt about it.&quot; My friend simply smiled. &quot;Ah, but of 
course. Nothing less of the great Lina Inverse.&quot;
	&quot;Lina INVERSE?&quot; My head was spinning and wasn&#39;t able to 
process all the new information. This information sent me reeling. I 
knew about the infamous Dra-mata from my time as Anyanka. Since the 
old land was Mazoku territory I wasn&#39;t really active there but I had 
always kept a close eye on my home. And even if not. Everyone knew 
about Lina Inverse, slayer of Hellmaster Fibrizo, not to mention 
Demon Lord Dark Star and of course that one seventh of Shabranigdu... 
I should have known. There are not so many people named Lina with 
that abilities and the name was rooted in Japan I think. So, even 
less chances of a coincidence. The realization simply hadn&#39;t come. No 
wonder Rack was practically without a serious chance. The person in 
question just smiled wryly at my surprised outburst.
	&quot;Indeed, Anya. I did tell you that you had everything 
necessary to avert the prophecy already at hand.&quot; The look he 
received clearly indicated that I was not convinced, maybe a little 
more hopeful, but not convinced. &quot;Prophecy?&quot; Lina asked curiously, 
walking over to us. &quot;The Crossing,&quot; I replied curtly to which the red-
haired mage boggled. An eyebrow raised, her tone was quite 
disbelieving. &quot;Excuse me? I&#39;m not in the mood for jokes right now. I 
have a magic addict to train, there is no time for prophecies.&quot;
	&quot;I wasn&#39;t joking.&quot; Daryial&#39;s laugh bellowed through the alley 
and Lina looked stricken. &quot;You really have to work on this bluntness 
problem of yours.&quot; I swatted the dragon on the arm. &quot;That&#39;s how I am, 
can&#39;t change it.&quot; After a period of silence Lina sighed heavily and 
swinging her arms wildly around, a rant was soon spilling from her 
lips. &quot;Great. As something would ever go the easy way. You&#39;ll owe me 
for that Giles...&quot;
	I shut out her rant and turned to Daryial. &quot;So, what do we do 
now?&quot; My old friend&#39;s smile did not waver. &quot;This is in your hands. I 
have merely been a messenger and must return to my home.&quot; Blinking, I 
stared at him, my anger quickly rising. &quot;WHAT? You are leaving?!? But 
we need every help we can get! This is the ultimate thread we are 
speaking about here! You can&#39;t just go and do other things as if 
nothing is happening!&quot; As always that didn&#39;t do any good. &quot;This is 
not my fight, Sister. My kin will stand by to do their part of the 
prophecy if it ever comes to the worst but until then the fate of 
your world is in your hands.&quot; With a warm, reassuring smile - which 
failed miserably to have the desire effect - and a respectful bow to 
Lina he took of into the air and soon a golden-tinted dragon took of 
into the distance.
	Lina had been following the exchange and Daryial&#39;s departure 
with an exasperated expression and now simply rolled her 
eyes. &quot;Dragons! I tell you they are too damn lazy to do something 
themselves for a change!&quot; I could only agree.

(Buffy)
Sunlight filtered through the curtains and brushed over eyelids, 
forcing them to blink open against their will. Hmm, this feel nice. 
Nice, fluffy Willow pillow, those arms around me are nice to... Uh... 
The train of thought began to register through the haze of sleep and 
I think I had to be congratulated for staying completely still 
instead of jumping right under the ceiling. Memories slowly came 
floating back. Last night, I staked Spike - Wow! -, then there was 
Scar... Lina. And then we had found Willow near death. Lina, Tara and 
I had somehow managed to bring her back, I wasn&#39;t quite sure how.
	&quot;Willow was right when she said you are always up early.&quot; I 
turned slowly in the loose embrace and managed to spot Tara hovering 
halfway up over my best friend and smiling down at me with one her 
patent smiles that could light up a room. &quot;Feeling better?&quot; Not quite 
sure what to answer, I simply nodded. Glancing at Willow who was 
peacefully sleeping, snuggled up against Tara and in the process with 
her front brushing against me, I thought about how odd that looked. 
Not to mention what an impression that could give. My own feelings 
for the redhead were not helping the matter.
	&quot;I, um... What...?&quot; Okay, that was lame Summers. Looking up 
at Tara I was a little startled to find compassion in her blue eyes 
instead of the jealously I feared to find there. She ought to know, 
she had to know. After last night I was sure she knew what Willow 
meant to me. Did she know why I would never do anything too? Tara 
smiled gently and reached out to touch my shoulder with one hand. I 
felt strangely at peace. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. She just likes to 
snuggles. Did this even before we were together.&quot; An image of Willow 
snuggling up to a shy Tara during a harmless sleepover at her dorm 
popped into my mind and I could not help but laugh... Which in turn 
managed to wake up a grumpy Willow, who proved the point by snuggling 
closer to me since her girlfriend had pulled back a little. I must 
have blushed madly but Tara didn&#39;t give a sign that she had noticed.
	&quot;Whazzsofunny?&quot; Regaining my composure I grinned at my best 
friend. Tara was hard not to burst into giggles... and failing 
miserably. Willow did not response for several seconds and I had 
almost thought she had fallen back to sleep before raising her head 
and leveling a full-fledged Willow pout at the blonde wiccan. &quot;Oh,&quot; I 
decided to answer her incoherent question. &quot;Tara was just telling me 
that you are a notorious snuggle person.&quot; Willow froze for a moment 
and then slowly turned around to find me grinning like a Cheshire 
Cat. Of course that only served to further put Willow off. And soon 
the trademark Willow pout turned into a trademark babble that even I 
could not quite decipher.
	The main message, however, wasn&#39;t lost on us and it was Tara 
pulling Willow back into a tight embrace that helped end the 
redhead&#39;s rambling. I tried hard not to look as the blonde Wiccan 
whispered something into Willow&#39;s ear and turned her around for a 
short kiss. I could feel a tingle run up my spine. What the...? 
Whatever worries my best friend were apparently flung out of the 
window. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Buffy. Didn&#39;t mean to make you uncomfortable.&quot; I 
waved her apology off and feeling in the mood to tease for some 
reason, told her that I indeed had felt quite comfortable. Willow 
blushed at that and Tara softly smiled.
	&quot;Ok,&quot; I said seriously, calming my own nerves, especially 
with the closeness of the two women. Just harmless snuggles with your 
two favorite witches, Buffy, nothing to get... excited about. Yeah 
sure. Anyway, serious, right. &quot;So, before we break into the usual 
routine of asking if everyone is alright, I think since we are all 
still alive it is safe to assume that we came out well from last 
night, considering the circumstances. You, Willow, got yourself a 
teacher and you two are getting back together. So everything&#39;s fine.&quot; 
Maybe I was averting. Was I averting? Nah. I let my head fall back on 
the pillow satisfied with my logic.
	&quot;And you?&quot; Tara asked not scolding but very softly. Damn, I 
had been averting. &quot;Everything is fine.&quot; Didn&#39;t help that Willow 
chose that moment to gasp and huge me tightly I could feel her 
breasts pressing into my back as I tried to turn away and head to 
fight of a sudden wave of heat. &quot;Oh Goddess, Buffy, I remember. I&#39;m 
so sorry, I failed you completely. That spell must have went 
completely wrong.&quot; Hah? What was Willow talking about, I turned and 
tried to get a look at my friend&#39;s face but she kept on avoiding my 
inquiring gaze.
	&quot;Willow, what are you talking about?&quot; I was completely at a 
loss here. When Willow looked at me with tear-stained eyes I think I 
felt my heart melt and was ready to forgive her anything, whatever it 
was that she thought to have messed up. &quot;I... When you... we were 
outside and I could see you for a moment... I could see it. Your 
soul... it is...&quot;
	&quot;I know,&quot; I quietly interrupted, hugging her tightly. Tara 
did the same from the other side, stroking her fingers through red 
strands. &quot;Baby, you couldn&#39;t have known. Buffy asked me to research 
the spell because... of that and I didn&#39;t find it. I could blame 
myself as much as you for not seeing it but that won&#39;t help Buffy 
now.&quot; I smiled at the blonde wiccan, glad for her support and 
understanding. That had helped me immensely in the last months. &quot;It&#39;s 
alright, Tara. I feel a lot better already. I... He isn&#39;t a problem 
anymore anyway.&quot;
	Tara was relieved, while Willow was simply confused. &quot;Who are 
we talking about?&quot; I hesitated, not sure whether or not share this so 
soon. It was not as if anybody knew about it, other than Tara and 
Lina. But I hated lying to my friends, I still knew from past 
experience that secrets always were lifted in the worst moments. And 
I DID feel better. Just being here with Willow and Tara was lifting 
my spirits immensely. I hadn&#39;t been like this morning ever since I 
came back. Not even close. Maybe it was a side effect of the magic... 
or maybe I was just looking for excuses.
	&quot;Spike,&quot; I said flatly and flustered at the same time. We had 
sat up by now and I was looking down into my lap. &quot;Spike? What about 
Spike?&quot; I could practically see Willow looking back and forth between 
me and her girlfriend. &quot;I... I... uh...&quot; Damn, Summers, get a grip. 
This is your best friend. And this is the best chance to talk about 
those things you had since you began that horrible tryst. Taking a 
deep breath, my voice was still shaking as I answered her. &quot;I slept 
with Spike. I... I let him use me just to get some feeling inside of 
me.&quot; I spat the last words out and the more I thought about it, the 
more I realized how sick the whole thing had been.
	There was silence for a LONG time. Then, after an eternity of 
agonizing waiting, Willow uttered a single, &quot;Oh,&quot; then added, &quot;Did it 
help?&quot; Leave it to Willow to make the most unexpected common. &quot;No.&quot; I 
could feel her draw me into another hug. Dimly aware that Willow&#39;s 
arms weren&#39;t the only ones supporting the embrace, I relaxed in the 
familiar feeling of support and peace for a moment or two, before 
detangling myself from the two wiccans.
	&quot;You said he wasn&#39;t a problem anymore?&quot; Tara asked 
cautiously. &quot;Yeah, did you finally stake him. I always thought you 
wouldn&#39;t since he was defenseless,&quot; Willow added. &quot;He could hurt me,&quot; 
I said quietly, not really counting on our closeness and for my 
friend to hear. &quot;What? How? Oh, it&#39;s because of the...&quot; I stopped the 
ramble with a sigh and by giving her hand a firm squeeze. &quot;That&#39;s 
what Lina said too. I think she was in a similar situation once.&quot;
	&quot;Lina?&quot; Willow asked and I realized that she had no idea 
about her new teacher&#39;s ability since she only saw her briefly, right 
on the threshold of death. &quot;Giles sent her. I think she&#39;s sort of 
your new teacher.&quot; THAT got the redhead to blink. &quot;She is?&quot;
	&quot;You need help, Sweetie. I thought...&quot;
	&quot;You? You called, Giles?&quot; Even though I think it was 
mentioned last night, I was as surprised as Willow. Sensing that this 
was apparently turning into a magic discussion and therefore nearing 
the critical part of their breakup I decided to slip out of the bed 
and quietly give them some privacy. Neither of them seemed to notice. 
Sometimes Slayer stealth is a neat thing.

(Xander)
I wasn&#39;t worried. No really, I was not. She had after all blasted a 
vamp last night as if it was nothing. So what should I be worried 
about? &quot;I&#39;m not worried,&quot; I muttered under my breath. Dawn who was 
sitting nearby sighed exasperated. &quot;Sure, Xander. You are not 
worried.&quot; I looked at the teen strangely and then just resumed my 
walk around the living room that had the only purpose to get some 
blood running in my sleep-yearning limbs. Really. I didn&#39;t get more 
than three hours troubled sleep this night at best and Dawn wasn&#39;t 
better off. This in itself wasn&#39;t such an unusual thing for a typical 
Sunnydale crisis night but work had been hard and when I came back 
home I was ready to drop dead. I wasn&#39;t worried, I just needed some 
sleep.
	That of course was why I literally jumped out of my skin when 
I heard the front door opening and my head snapped around audibly in 
a way I was surprised not to break my neck in the process. 
Disappointed flooded through me as I only saw the redhead from last 
night poking her head inside but that was immediately changed when 
Anya followed her through the door. She seemed rather agitated about 
something and kept glancing almost in awe at the stranger. Besides 
that she seemed alright... Which of course didn&#39;t prevent me from 
checking.
	&quot;An, are you alright. You... I...&quot; Okay, maybe I was a little 
worried. Just a little bit. But I wouldn&#39;t admit that. After all I 
had to uphold certain standards for the only male present at the 
moment. My fianc&eacute;e nodded quietly and I was startled to find her 
reaching up to briefly touch my cheek. &quot;I&#39;m okay, Xander. I didn&#39;t 
even do very much.&quot; I let go of a breath I wasn&#39;t aware of 
holding. &quot;So, this Rack guy is history?&quot;
	&quot;Yes!&quot; Anya exclaimed a little too loudly for my tired senses 
and quickly launched into a praise rant that I wasn&#39;t able to proceed 
more than the basic message from. The stranger, a Lina Inverse, was 
as it seemed somewhat a legend among the demons, more like a feared 
legend. A very powerful witch... sorceress and that she was totally 
cool in Anya&#39;s opinion.
	&quot;So, why are you here?&quot; I asked Lina after Anya finally run 
out of breath. The newcomer had watched the whole thing with mild 
amusement. &quot;Your friend Tara called Giles because of Willow and I&#39;m 
sort of in his debt. So I&#39;m here to help her come to terms with her 
magic,&quot; she answered with a yawn. It seemed I wasn&#39;t the only one who 
was tired here. &quot;Come to terms with it? I thought she said she wanted 
to quit?&quot; I shuddered a little under the intense gaze suddenly 
leveled upon me. &quot;You can&#39;t just quit magic. It doesn&#39;t work that 
way. Magic means power and power comes always with a price. It can 
either demand responsibilities or consume a person.&quot;
	I nodded slowly. &quot;So, it&#39;s like The Force?&quot; I quipped, half-
joking. &quot;Exactly.&quot; Okay, one point for Xander. Score!
	&quot;You all look like hell, you know?&quot; Buffy&#39;s voice came from 
the stairs and I turned around to see the blonde slayer walking into 
the living room. Was it just me or had she adapted a certain... skip 
in her step. &quot;And you look better than ever,&quot; Dawn commented, 
obviously taking note of the same thing and promptly yawned as 
well. &quot;I feel a lot better actually. Why don&#39;t you all get a few 
hours of sleep in. I believe we have much to discuss but I&#39;m sure 
especially Lina and Anya are tired from their battle.&quot; Glancing over 
at Anya I felt a little guilty about noticing she was exhausted as 
well. Maybe she really didn&#39;t do that much as she claimed but staying 
up all night didn&#39;t go without visible signs as well.
	None of us was able to argue with Buffy&#39;s suggestion and so I 
grabbed Anya and we promptly snuggled up on the couch while Dawn 
trotted upstairs. I could see Buffy and Lina hovering at the stairs 
for a moment, quietly talking in a way that made me somewhat 
suspicious. Then the redhead went off to the phone, only to come back 
a few minutes later to follow Dawn upstairs.

(Giles)
Putting back the phone on the receiver I could not tell if my day had 
been worse before or after the phone call. The information Lina had 
given me were jumbled and you were clearly able to tell that she was 
tired. I hadn&#39;t expected things going so out of control on the night 
of her arrival already... Then again, her own youth had probably been 
as wild as mine. Willow&#39;s condition had deeply worried me and Lina&#39;s 
assurance that she was alright for the moment did not help my own 
guilt. I should really have done something earlier, Ripper or not. 
Those children had looked up to me like a father and I had always 
considered them as such. What father turned away when their kids 
needed them the most?
	I was secretly glad that Lina and Buffy apparently got along 
well and very openly glad about the demise of Rack and Spike, though 
she clearly avoided details about the latter. That was not my 
business anyway. I had hoped that Lina&#39;s own past would give her some 
clue how to deal with my Slayer&#39;s reintegration problem and from what 
I had been able to read between the lines of her short report, they 
seemed to get along well.
	Up to this point it had only been a matter of increased guilt 
and worry, mixed with a little relief. That would have not prompted 
me to reschedule my flight for the next morning to tonight. 
Mentioning of this damn prophecy did. Now I was frantically packing 
the rest of my clothes while with one hand reaching for the phone 
again. I might regret this later but I had no illusions that this 
would be anything like Glory. No, Glory was an infant compared to 
this.
	The dial tone came up a couple of times before a click could 
be heard. &quot;It&#39;s me,&quot; I answered the man on the other side. &quot;Listen, 
we have no time nor the room for trading verbal jabs. I&#39;ve just got 
off the phone with Mrs. Inverse. It seemed several hints by people 
she trusts enough with this sort of information have been dropped 
that The prophecy is in motion.&quot; A pause and a question. &quot;Yes, I am 
speaking of The Crossing.&quot; It was amusing to witness how people would 
go from being sulky to serious. I would have smiled if the situation 
hadn&#39;t been so humorless.
	&quot;I want every available text on this sent to me. And have the 
other one released. Can that be arranged?&quot; A long pause as expected. 
I was reluctant to do this without Buffy&#39;s consent but we could not 
afford taking this lightly, even if it turned out to be nothing after 
all - which I think all of us would prefer much more. &quot;Yes, Angel 
said she made remarkable progress. I think the risk is acceptable,&quot; I 
answered the other man. &quot;Alright. I am flying tonight. Be prepared... 
for the worst.&quot; With that I cut the connection and sat down on the 
bed, suddenly feeling a lot older.
	Why now? Everything over there was already so grim. They were 
in no shape to face this, not even with Lina helping. And now I had 
set the redheaded sorceress right into the middle of it. I knew she 
didn&#39;t want to do this sort of thing anymore. The temptation was 
still there, would always be and it scared me to think of what she 
was capable... of what she could be capable when leaving all 
restraints behind. This could backfire badly. However, it was done 
now and Lina was never one to back down from a challenge. She would 
face this with my kids come hell and high water. Maybe it was a good 
thing after all...
	I stood and took down an old, dusty book from the many 
shelves. Opening the ancient volume I searched for my own copy of The 
Crossing. I should be prepared when I got back to Sunnydale.

(Tara)
Goddess, that was even harder than I thought it would be. Buffy had 
slipped away quietly and I was still debating with myself whether 
this was a good or bad thing. The blonde Slayer&#39;s presence had been 
calming and relaxing at the same time. None of us had laughed so 
freely ever since Buffy dived into that vortex... probably even some 
time before that. I hadn&#39;t wanted this moment to end, yet this 
conversation had to come, both us knew that.
	Gathering my courage I lifted my head, ending the staring 
period at the bed sheets. &quot;Yes, Willow. I called Giles.&quot; That old 
stubbornness and disbelief shown through for a moment. For that brief 
fraction of time I thought she would accuse me of distrusting her 
which I didn&#39;t. I just distrusted her addiction. There was a 
difference after all.
	Quickly the surely sharp remark faded from my girlfriend&#39;s 
lips and she just dropped her gaze. &quot;Oh.&quot; After some time she added 
cautiously: &quot;Why?&quot; I think she knew as well as me that this question 
didn&#39;t need to be answered but for her sanity&#39;s sake she probably had 
to ask. &quot;Because this can&#39;t go on. Everything is not right anymore, 
for a long time actually. We all know it but are unable to do 
something. You need help, Willow, you can&#39;t fight this addiction all 
by yourself.&quot; I was proud of myself to have said that without a 
stutter. Willow didn&#39;t need insecure Tara now, she needed a strong, 
supporting partner. One that I had not been when it counted.
	&quot;And that is why you left me?&quot; The sentence was out before 
she could stop it and I could see her flinch slightly but at the same 
time a certain resolve building. The pointed sarcasm was hitting too 
close to home for my liking. &quot;N-No... Willow, I-I...&quot; Damn 
stutter. &quot;I... You can&#39;t just drop the magic, it doesn&#39;t work that 
way. You n-need to get it under control.&quot; Of course that was just the 
wrong thing to say in this situation. The redhead&#39;s head snapped up 
and even though her answer was only softly whispered, it echoed in my 
heart over and over again, threatening to shatter right there and 
then. &quot;You told me to stop.&quot;
	I inched backwards slowly, not able to face the tired and 
somewhat bitter expression on my lover&#39;s face. That was going all 
wrong. I was supposed to forgive her, be angry for a little time but 
forgive her in the end and everything would be fine. But nothing had 
been fine lately. Had it ever been? Had I ever been the person that 
Willow wanted, hadn&#39;t it always been... Stop it, Tara! This is not 
helping. Willow loves you and she needs you now. Taking a deep breath 
I tried calming my nerves but everything that came out was a choked 
sob, as tears unbidden formed in my eyes.
	&quot;Tara? Baby?&quot; I turned away from the suddenly worried tone in 
Willow&#39;s voice. A heavy pang of guilt and overwhelming sadness 
overflowed me as the picture alone on that park bench a few days ago 
came to mind. That had been the final straw to my flawed resolve. It 
had taken all my strength not to just rush over there and beg for 
forgiveness. &quot;Tara?&quot; I felt a gentle hand on my shoulder and almost 
jerked away. Willow hesitated for a moment but then moved before I 
could react. I melted into the familiar and oh so missed embrace with 
no reluctance at all.
	&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to snap at you... It&#39;s just... I am...&quot; Before 
she could finish I finally let go of the emotions and tears. Burying 
my head in the nightshirt I had somehow managed to put onto her last 
night, the words came from alone, bubbling out like a 
fountain. &quot;Goddess, Willow, I&#39;m so sorry. I know, I shouldn&#39;t have 
said that and I know I should have been strong for you. But I 
couldn&#39;t, it was just too much and... and... I saw you two days ago 
on that park bench...&quot; Willow gasped and started to say something but 
I didn&#39;t stop to let her talk. &quot;Y-You were so miserable and I just 
thought what a coward I h-had been to bolt. I&#39;m the girlfriend, I am 
supposed to be strong for you if necessary. Even when I left it tore 
my heart apart, I couldn&#39;t help t-thinking about you. And everything 
we saw each other, I cried myself to sleep these nights...&quot;
	I trailed off, looking up at my girlfriend who was struggling 
with her own feelings. Her mouth opened and closed but no sound came 
out. I know that she just wanted to do something but hesitated, 
unsure of what to do. There was an uncomfortable silence that both us 
clearly yearned to break. &quot;There is so much to talk about, so much to 
deal with and forget but...&quot; Anya and the strangers news from 
yesterday evening sprang to my mind suddenly. Would our problems 
really be insignificant compared to this? No. No, they couldn&#39;t be 
because like we were now none of us was able to face what was coming.
	&quot;Can&#39;t you just kiss me now?&quot; I asked in a tiny, almost 
inaudible noise. Willow heard though and complied. Leaning forward I 
met her halfway with my own lips and felt that strong sense of 
belonging envelope me again. Yes, there would be a lot to talk about. 
Hard feelings to work through, however, for now I was home. Right 
there I belonged. We both were.

(Xander)
The mists were thick and concealing everything outside of an 
immediate two to three feet radius from sight. The air was equally 
most, filled with the typical smell of thickness you often 
encountered on heated summer mornings just before dawn. A few trees 
could be spotted through the white and gray haze but if it was a 
forest, a park or just a few single trees was yet to be seen. The 
pronunciation lay on seen.
	I think I was dreaming although I wondered if it didn&#39;t defy 
the concept that I could tell that. However, it was either that or 
someone had brought me here and I would really pretend the dreaming 
alternative. Alone and disorientated I walked through the mists, 
tasting thick wetness on my lips time and time again. My steps were 
not purposeful but pulled into a specific direction, as if something 
was calling out to me.
	After some wandering the mists seemed to clear away, 
revealing an island of clarity in which a massive stone altar - I 
guessed - stood. It seemed heavy and as I stepped closer noted that 
it was going up to chest level. Hovering - and I mean HOVERING - over 
the altar was a single sword. A golden hilt with an emerald embedded 
in it and a gleaming blade of the lightest silver I had ever seen.
	The weapon was, said with one word, simply beautiful. There 
was a feeling as if it was actually alive, I could feel some kind of 
energy flowing even though I wasn&#39;t even sensitive for this sort of 
thing. I had seen all sorts of weapons in my &quot;career&quot; as a 
Slayerette, this one, however, awed me for some strange reason that I 
could not identify.
	Tentatively I reached out. I wasn&#39;t sure if I should even 
touch this thing. It never came to it anyway. &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; a distinctive 
female voice came from behind and I pulled my hand back as if the air 
around the sword itself was electrified. I whirled around to face the 
owner of the voice and boggled at the sight. The woman was tiny, even 
a lot smaller than Buffy. Her body though in definitely good and 
trained shape was lean and surely agile. That in itself wouldn&#39;t have 
been so unnerving if the stranger wouldn&#39;t have possessed that 
angular face and the long, pointed ears. Light violet hair gleamed in 
the dimmed light filtering through the mists and a set of the most 
enthralling and exotic eyes greeted me with a inhuman kindness. The 
pupils were perfectly white, there was not a trace of black, only a 
tint of gold or was that silver? I wasn&#39;t able to clearly tell.
	&quot;Wha...? Who? Where?&quot; I babbled out, feeling totally out of 
place and even more confused than I felt this morning before trying 
to catch up on some sleep. &quot;All very important question from which 
none of that has to concern you right now. The Why though would be 
more important.&quot; Did nobody give a straight answer anymore? What was 
it with people these days? Did they always have to be that cryptic?
	The woman - girl? - chuckled. &quot;I am merely following certain 
necessities. I am not as annoying as Xellos... I hope.&quot; Not that that 
helped ANY to clear up at least some confusion. I could vaguely make 
the connection of the name to the person who had dropped in our 
apartment.
	The elf - I assumed after all that she was one - looked 
apologetic. &quot;Your question will be answered soon, Warrior. It is, 
however, necessary to know if you are ready to face what is to come. 
You will play an important role in the upcoming struggle that will 
test your limits physically, mentally and emotional.&quot; I held up my 
hands in a frantic gesture to stop the flow of even more confusing 
information. &quot;Wait a minute? What struggle? What do I have to do with 
it? What the hell is that all about?!?&quot; I had the feeling that 
everybody knew already what was going on except me. I didn&#39;t like 
being out of the loop of things, even if I wasn&#39;t able to provide 
much to the quickly growing very powerful Scoobies.
	&quot;But you do, young warrior. Your heart is strong and you have 
the spirit of a great fighter. You WILL be of much help to your 
friends.&quot; I eyed the elf suspiciously. She hadn&#39;t answered my 
questions again. Slowly I became clearly frustrated. &quot;Are you willing 
to take the responsibilities that come with power as your friends 
have already been faced to do. I can provide you with such power and 
skill beyond your imagination. But remember power always comes with a 
price.&quot;
	At first I was always ready to jump at the chance of being 
able to help my friends. I always had felt inadequate compared to the 
Slayer and the two witches, even my fianc&eacute;e was an ex-demon who 
possessed great knowledge - and probably a lot more that I wasn&#39;t 
sure about. However, Willow&#39;s trip down the darker realms of magic 
came unbidden back to my mind as did Lina&#39;s words from this morning, 
only enforcing the stranger&#39;s warning. Still... She seemed genuine in 
her offer and I KNEW there was no evil intent whatsoever. No 
manipulating. She was giving me a choice with this...
	&quot;What will happen when I refuse?&quot; The woman stared at me 
intently for several moments, as if seeing right through me and into 
my heart. &quot;Your friends quite possible will die.&quot;
	I had no choice after all.

(Willow)
It was about an hour later that I came down the stairs. Tara was 
lightly asleep though I suspected it would not be much longer. Mostly 
silence greeted me and I spotted Xander and Anya out like a light 
snuggled together on the couch. Pausing slightly I studied them for 
awhile and took a double-take. I could almost feel the powerful and 
clearly not flawed aura of magic around her. It seemed there was more 
going on around here than I had realized. Much more. Xander turned a 
little in his sleep and there was a deep expression of worry engraved 
in his face. Suddenly there was a spike of power that made me jump.
	&quot;Willow?&quot; I spun around, ready to unleash a bolt of lightning 
from my fingertips. Buffy was standing behind me and my best friend 
took a careful step back. I breathed in deeply, my nerves had been 
almost fried and I hadn&#39;t been in a good shape with the talk with 
Tara earlier to begin with. &quot;Don&#39;t do that,&quot; I snapped, not harshly 
but irritate. The Slayer shook her head. &quot;Geez, Willow. I can 
understand that with everything going on, we all are a bit jumpy. But 
what was that all about?&quot;
	&quot;Xander just spiked?&quot; A lifted eyebrow answered me and I 
sighed, realizing that my friend hadn&#39;t understood a word. &quot;I&#39;ve 
become quite good with reading auras. That has more to do with 
experience than with magic, so I didn&#39;t do any...&quot; Buffy stopped my 
babble with a smile. &quot;Willow, you don&#39;t need to explain it to me. I 
trust you. Yes, you made a mistake, a lot of mistakes. But we all do 
them over and over again. That is only human. Hell, I can&#39;t even 
count how often I did something stupid. I trust though that you 
learned something out of this.&quot; I nodded quietly to her statement. I 
did learn something alright. And almost lost everything important in 
the process. But Buffy had made clear that she was ready to forgive 
me, whenever I was actually ready to accept it.
	&quot;Thanks, but Dawn probably won&#39;t speak a word to me ever 
again.&quot; Buffy laughed lightly to my annoyance, eliciting a pout from 
me. &quot;Yeah, laugh at the miserable Willow, will you?&quot; Reaching out 
with one hand she touched my shoulder briefly, then totally 
unexpected pulled me into a quick hug. It felt nice, almost like 
Tara... The thought startled me but I did not dare to pull away. I 
hadn&#39;t even fully admitted it to myself but I think I loved Buffy as 
much as I did Tara and I always got the feeling that the blonde 
Slayer knew it exactly. The time just never seemed right and now I 
was with Tara. A relationship that was the most wonderful thing in my 
young life.
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry about the squirt. She can be a pest sometimes 
but I think she forgave you already. She&#39;s just having a hard time 
admitting that to herself.&quot; Hopefully Buffy knew her sister as well 
as she claimed, otherwise I would probably have a hard time coming 
into the good graces of the younger Summers again. She had barely 
spoken a word in my direction ever since the accident and I tried 
avoiding being alone with her in the house. It was simply too awkward.
	&quot;So what was that about Xander being spiked? Funny choice of 
words actually.&quot; I choked back laughter and slipped out of Buffy&#39;s 
embrace to look at the couple again. &quot;First off Anya has some sort of 
heavy magic aura. We all know that her spells often are worse than 
what I did before finding Tara.&quot; I cringed briefly at one particular 
memory with that Will Be Done spell. &quot;But what I can see now clearly 
is rooted in experience. And I can safely tell you it hadn&#39;t been 
there a few days ago. Then again, she could have shielded herself...&quot;
	Nodding silently, Buffy said: &quot;She went after Lina last night 
when she got out to confront Rack. They returned just an hour ago. 
Xander and Dawn didn&#39;t get much sleep either.&quot; Understandable. Xander 
was probably worried sick and confused like hell with all what had 
been going on... Waitaminute! Confront Rack? He was... My mind jumped 
back to a brief sensation I had when waking up in the night. Goddess, 
when this Lina was THAT powerful - and I remembered seeing her aura 
yesterday - and she was here to teach me... Boy, that would be 
interesting.
	&quot;Alright, Xander,&quot; I said aloud, startling Buffy after a 
period of silence, deciding to file back the question about Rack for 
a later time. &quot;Just before you came there was a brief power spike 
around him. Nothing magical at all but something has happened to him 
and now...&quot; I narrowed my eyes. &quot;He is literally buzzing with some 
kind of untapped energy.&quot;
	To underline my words a heavy looking sword, with a green 
hilt and a long blade decided to pop into existence - along with a 
matching scabbard - and clattered to the ground making both of us 
jump this time and succeeding in waking up Xander and Anya rather 
unpleasantly.
	Slowly I began to wonder if fighting this magic problem was 
really the worst of my problems. I could practically smell a prophecy 
brewing...

------------------------------------------------------------

Well that last few scenes were written quicker than I thought. Maia 
seems to be as much on a roll here as she had been with Mistletoes in 
December... Well, I&#39;m completely at her mercy anyway, so who am I to 
complain?

Again this was a good point to end. I never really wanted to divide 
this in chapters or parts, it just makes the posting easier, So, if 
some parts in the future are longer or shorter than the previous, I 
try to make the cuts where they seem appropriate.

Before I begin with notes to this part. One or two things to clear up 
from the previous part. I have no idea about Paganism despite what 
seen in the show or read in fiction, so The Crossing is my own idea 
and does not exist anywhere to my knowledge (though I wouldn&#39;t be 
surprised if it did, you never know). Bear with me, I&#39;m not good at 
writing prophecies but I&#39;ll try my best.

I repeat myself probably but sometimes readers jump to the weirdest 
conclusion. This is NOT a Buffy/Willow or Buffy/Willow/Tara-CENTERED 
fic. Which doesn&#39;t mean that there won&#39;t be interaction and honest 
feelings between them but I intend to focus on the pairings defined 
in the header. Whatever goes beyond this will be a development in the 
story and fans of either B/W and/or B/W/T will get something later 
on. The relationships per se will stay defined though. Just to clear 
any confusion from the start about the scenes of interaction between 
the girls in this part. From the next one onward I will focus more on 
Willow and Tara reconciling and of course getting Buffy and Lina 
closer.

Since we are at the topic. Was the Willow/Tara scene any good? I 
usually don&#39;t write or particular read stories with them outside 
triad fics and I&#39;m not sure if I get them good or not. You can tell 
me if it was horrible, honestly, as long as you say what aggravated 
you. That often helps more than false praise. Not that I want to say 
I take any praise as false...

I told Sabrina (a reviewer over from ff.net/newest member of my 
group) that already. Daryial will be back, eventually. I don&#39;t invent 
characters and then drop them again. I just have to think up away to 
effectively bring him back into the plot (which I have surprising 
rather well planned out to a certain point).

Since most of this part has been adding even more secrets and 
questions, I think that was all. No, I don&#39;t answer questions about 
Lina or Anya&#39;s past or something like that. Where would be the fun, 
eh?

More of the prophecy, reestablishing and building relationship next 
time. And don&#39;t worry you won&#39;t get rid of Xellos so easily... Not 
that this would ever be possible.

Constructive criticism, death threats or any other form of feedback 
to the address in the header or simply place a review wherever you 
find this. 

Ja ne, yours
