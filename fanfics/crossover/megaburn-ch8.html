KA-THOOM!

The small private plane wobbled in the air, drifting,
then it suddenly crashed down into a deserted road on
it&#39;s approach to the Megatokyo airport. The fireball
rapidly consumed both the plane and all of it&#39;s
passengers, the flames rising higher and higher. It
had been chartered for the group of old friends, five
schoolmates and their friends from over 50 years ago
out on some impulsive reunion. The fire burned hot,
consuming the wreckage until the only way to identify
the inhabitants would be through the tiny traces of
organic material that remained.

&quot;All right Rei,&quot; the blonde said softly as the group
watched the flames from the shadows of a nearby
rooftop, &quot;I think that&#39;s enough.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Minako,&quot; and with that Rei Hino stopped her
chanting, the raven haired young woman letting her
hands drop down to her sides. She looked over at Ami
and quietly asked, &quot;Do you think that will fool
everyone?&quot;

The blue haired lady pushed her glasses up, reaching
out to take Rei&#39;s hand in her own. &quot;I think so,&quot; Ami
said, &quot;the accident was faked perfectly and the blood
we all donated will provide DNA for testing.&quot; With a
soft sigh she concluded, &quot;The world will believe we&#39;re
all dead.&quot;

Usagi looked out at the dying flames mournfully, her
long blonde hair tied back in a very atypical braid.
&quot;It&#39;s going to take awhile to get used to new names
and identities,&quot; she smiled wryly, &quot;even though we all
know it was about time.&quot;

Mamoru put his arm around her shoulders, gently
drawing her close. &quot;Does Naru know about what we&#39;re
doing?&quot; the black haired man asked.

A tear glistened on Usagi&#39;s cheek, &quot;Of course I told
her. I couldn&#39;t simply drop out of sight without at
least saying good-bye to my best friend.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ll miss her too,&quot; Mamoru admitted, knowing
that faking their deaths meant they were going to have
to avoid most of their past contacts. He quietly said,
&quot;Considering how old we were supposed to be, it&#39;s a
bit of a relief.&quot;

&quot;More than you know,&quot; Makoto agreed bleakly, the brown
haired amazon standing slightly apart from the others.

&quot;Poor kid,&quot; Natsuna Sakurada sadly commented, the much
older woman moving up to stand by Minako&#39;s side. Once
red hair was now nearly all gray, but a combination of
magic and good genes kept her vigorous and full of
life.

&quot;Thank you for doing this with us,&quot; Minako leaning up
against her lover, &quot;I know it was a sacrifice for
you.&quot;

The older woman hugged Minako close to her gently, a
slight smile on her face. &quot;I won&#39;t be parted from you,
love,&quot; Natsuna said softly, &quot;not ever.&quot;

Makoto watch them with eyes haunted by pain,
remembering her own lost love. &quot;So,&quot; Makoto smiled
grimly, &quot;what are we going to do now?&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s my cue,&quot; Setsuna Meiou emerged from
the shadows, her mane of black hair flowing down her
back as she said, &quot;I&#39;ve made the arrangements as we
discussed, Ami.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s get going,&quot; Ami said as they followed her
off the roof.

The trip to the old Shinjuku district of Tokyo was a
quiet one, only the occasional words passing between
them. Weaving through traffic expertly Setsuna kept
her silence, letting those in the back slowly come to
accept their new situation. They finally pulled in
front of an older apartment building, one that was
familiar to all of them.

&quot;Didn&#39;t Juri used to live here?&quot; Rei blinked,
remembering back when they had chipped in to help with
the moving party.

&quot;She bought it,&quot; Setsuna had pride in her voice as she
continued, &quot;Juri owns it through a couple of shell
companies, so it can&#39;t be traced back to her.&quot; From
her pocket she removed sets of keys and added, &quot;You&#39;re
welcome to stay as long as you need.&quot;

&quot;I hope everyone doesn&#39;t mind,&quot; Ami said from where
she stood nearby Rei, &quot;but when I started discussing
faking our deaths with Setsuna she suggested this.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Usagi stepped forward to hug Setsuna,
smiling warmly. Her eyes twinkled as she added, &quot;Maybe
I&#39;ll try using the disguise pen to get Mamoru into the
Locket again.&quot;

Natsuna snickered, &quot;I&#39;ll look forward to seeing that.&quot;

Mamoru tried to look dignified, but it was hard to
manage as Usagi giggled softly. Setsuna lead the seven
of them inside, passing out keys and directing them to
their rooms. After some polite talk she left them to
settle in, probably going home to her waiting lover.

&quot;It&#39;s a lovely room,&quot; Natsuna commented as she sat
down on the edge of the bed, watching her lover pacing
restlessly.

&quot;You should tell them,&quot; Minako said as she opened the
curtains, looking out at the lights of what was now
part of Megatokyo.

Natsuna got up stiffly, moving to wrap her arms around
her lover from behind. &quot;Ami knows, of course,&quot; she
said softly, &quot;but there&#39;s nothing the others could
do.&quot;

Minako shook her head, a few tears sliding down her
cheeks as she said, &quot;But Usagi or Hotaru could try to
heal you....&quot;

Natsuna squeezed slightly, then eased off. &quot;And at
best give me a few more years,&quot; she said softly into
Minako&#39;s ear. She tilted her lover&#39;s face up and
added, &quot;And to become immortal has a cost that&#39;s far
too high for me, m&#39;love.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Minako sighed.

They knew immortality would come to humanity in time,
but Setsuna had revealed that it was many centuries
away. Worse, the methods that they had available now
to extend life would slowly change the individual,
eventually transforming them into something... other
than human.

&quot;I heard from a student recently,&quot; Natsuna said with a
false sort of casualness as she stepped back, &quot;from
back when I was teaching at the police academy.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Minako made herself pick up the bait, knowing it
would make Natsuna happy.

&quot;She heard about my past connection to the adventurer
Sailor V,&quot; Natsuna drawled, &quot;and was wondering if she
could help out in a case involving corporate
espionage.&quot; With that Natsuna quietly sketched in the
details of the recent robberies, the top secret items
that were stolen from more than one Boomer
manufacturer and designer.

Minako stood there silently for a moment, but Natsuna
could tell that she was interested. Finally, &quot;Would
you mind if I went out for a few hours?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be waiting for you,&quot; Natsuna said gently.

Minako walked over to kiss her lover lingeringly, then
she walked towards the window. As she took a step she
shifted, casual clothes becoming the sailor fuku that
she wore as a uniform. Sailor Venus offered her a
smile as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll be back as soon as I can.&quot;

With that she was out the window and gone,
free-falling from the upper story to land on a nearby
roof. Trails of tears glistening on her cheeks Venus
let herself cry, glad that her lover couldn&#39;t see her
doing it. The night sounds washed over her as she
bounded between advanced buildings and older
structures, eventually reaching an industrial section.

The Re-genex facility was still roped off by security
tape, even though Boomers and others moved across the
property making needed repairs. The point where the
armored suits had broken in was still a gaping hole,
but around the structure other repairs were being
efficiently made. Still, much of the security was
partially or completely off-line, making it easy for
Sailor Venus to slip inside.

She evaded all the cameras and security with the ease
of long practice, finding the ruptured storage vault
with relative ease. Sailor Venus studied the
compartments, noting the name Ayanami with a mild sort
of alarm, remembering the mysterious EVA pilot from
over twenty years ago.

Quietly Venus slipped away, soon standing on a nearby
building as she took a moment to considered the
situation. Rei &#39;Ayanami was supposed to be part
alien,&#39; she remembered, &#39;and disappeared along with
Asuka Soryu shortly after NERV was dissolved.&#39; She
frowned, &#39;So why is a major Boomer design company
interested in her?&#39;

Moving off Sailor Venus headed to her next stop,
bounding across the city as she made her way to the
Bioware facility. Supposedly they were the major
competitor of Re-genex, and therefore had the most to
gain from a attack or sabotage at Bioware.

Breaking in was more difficult here, but Sailor Venus
had some advantages that a normal cat-burglar
wouldn&#39;t. People moved in and out of the corporate
tower and soon Venus had a target, using her disguise
mirror to copy that person perfectly. Wearing another
face and a confident manner Venus strode by the
security office then made her way inside, navigating
the halls carefully.

From the same pocket that she normally concealed her
transformation wand and other magical artifacts Venus
took a small computer out, plugging in to an available
terminal. While not anywhere near the sort of hacker
that Mercury was she did know enough to search a
system from the inside, more or less.

The name &#39;Ayanami&#39; brought up several hits, all of
which she downloaded, then Venus sent out feelers
about Re-genex. The system coughed up the files
reluctantly, asking for clearances that she quickly
worked her way around. Satisfied that she had enough
information to begin her work she detached the
computer, stowing it away carefully.

Venus turned to go, striding away when she heard.... a
gunshot. She froze there, hesitating a second, then
with a curse ran back towards the direction the shot
came from. She found a open office door, running
inside only to freeze.

The young woman lay on the ground in a slowly growing
pool of red, her grayish brown braid curled up beside
her face. &quot;Hold on,&quot; Venus picked her up, careful of
the woman&#39;s chest wound and ran, knowing that whoever
had shot her was probably still in the building.</pre>
