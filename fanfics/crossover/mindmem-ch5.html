<h1>Mindful of Memories (part 5 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/imogene.html">Imogene</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/mindmem-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Rikku drew another deep breath through the pillow as she lay face down 
on her bed. Her headache throbbed waves of pain down her neck and 
stirred in her stomach. She could hear voices talking from the bedside, 
but couldn&#39;t hear the words over the rushing pulsing sound in her ears.

&quot;Eiko did get them, I remember Uncle Cid telling me about the headaches. 
He said... the doctor couldn&#39;t do anything for it. Then they went away. 
That was just before she... got...&quot; Garnet stopped and looked up at 
Zidane.

&quot;It probably isn&#39;t the same thing. You should call a doctor anyway...I&#39;m 
going to talk with Kuja. &quot; He turned and left the room.

Yuffie sat by the bed, for the last hour she had been holding Rikku&#39;s 
hand.

&quot;Someone just do something!&quot; Yuffie felt Rikku squeeze harder, as the 
pain intensified, &quot;Why can&#39;t we just get that man in the mirror to fix 
it?&quot;

Weak!

Rikku heard that voice again, as clear as if he was talking from inside 
her head.

Ha! You always were weak. Without your precious friends to help you 
you&#39;re nothing. Even then you only held them back, made them slower, led 
them to danger and what for? You even tried to stop them from fighting. 
You nearly ruined it all. You shouldn&#39;t even be alive.

Rikku was powerless to stop the voice. She had no voice of her own. Her 
mind was like Bikanel&#39;s barren sandy desert, blown by the hot wind, 
empty and lifeless.

Now that I can do whatever I like. I can kill that girl you know. I&#39;ll 
kill her... oh, but it will be you killing her wont it.

Rikku took another breath. She was blocked out of her own mind; all she 
could do was breathe and listen and struggle to scream, to cry out... 
anything. Left stranded with no sensation, no sight or sound, she 
couldn&#39;t even tell if she was moving. She couldn&#39;t even think in words, 
just terror, curled up in a dark corner of her own mind where she&#39;d been 
banished.

So weak!

----------

&quot;No response.&quot; Harriet flicked the torch over Rikku&#39;s eyes and shook her 
head. The doctor watched over her shoulder with a sullen expression. He 
wrote some notes in a small book and looked back at the crowd watching 
from the door.

&quot;Move her from this room to somewhere more secure. Keep her in a secure 
area. Lock the doors. Make sure she doesn&#39;t leave the area. Post guards 
to her door and bar any windows. Keep guards posted 24 hours. Post 
guards to the room and keep her under surveillance. Report anything more 
to me, especially anything she says while in this trance.&quot; He put the 
notebook in his pocket and waited for a reply.

&quot;What?!&quot; Yuffie strode past the doctor and took Rikku&#39;s hand again. 
Rikku stared unblinking at the ceiling.

Garnet was quick to guess, &quot;This is something you&#39;re familiar with isn&#39;t 
it.&quot;

The doctor nodded, &quot;Just this week... two others the same. Three reports 
of the same thing from Treno... it doesn&#39;t appear to be contagious. It 
does however... pose a risk to the patient. We&#39;ve lost every one of our 
patients so far... and I don&#39;t mean by death... literally every one of 
them has gone, vanished without a clue as to where. Mostly after a 
considerable amount of violence.&quot;

&quot;Why wasn&#39;t I informed of these events?&quot; Garnet asked as the answer 
presented itself to her mind. With all that was happening it might well 
have. Reports of people getting sick and going crazy would score low on 
the list of things to report to heads of state. Especially when there 
are other things to be taken care of.

&quot;I think Eiko might have had the same thing. But she was cured. I think. 
Uncle Cid did say she was having headaches and fainting a lot.&quot; Garnet 
watched as Yuffie gently closed Rikku&#39;s eyes.

The doctor glared wide eyed at Garnet, &quot;Cured? How?&quot;

Garnet shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Zidane took care of it.&quot; She 
didn&#39;t want to mention the mirror just yet. The issue of ghosts in 
people&#39;s heads would cause panic. But if other people were getting sick 
too then...

&quot;Cured. That would be a miracle. We don&#39;t even know what it is that 
causes the sickness.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ghosts! That&#39;s what it is. Stupid dumb ghosts,&quot; Yuffie yelled at 
Rikku, &quot;Listen you ghost, you better leave my friend alone or I&#39;ll kick 
your butt good! You hear me ghost?!&quot;

&quot;The condition does create mental instability in the patient but I 
really don&#39;t think you can just blame...&quot; the doctor was cut short of 
his lecture as Garnet interrupted.

&quot;No. It really is a... like a ghost. Some kind of mind parasite. It was 
inside Eiko&#39;s mind too.&quot;

Yuffie looked up, &quot;Yeh but it was ripped out right? There must be a 
whole lot of them everywhere.&quot;

----------

Zidane looked into the mirror at Kuja. Their conversation thus far had 
been confusing at best.

&quot;And what does a mirror do?&quot; Kuja asked.

&quot;It reflects stuff.&quot; Zidane answered.

&quot;Correct.&quot;

----------

Rikku gasped and sat up. She could see Yuffie staring into her eyes but 
her view was distant like staring through the wrong end of binoculars. 
Yuffie spoke; Rikku could hear only a distant mumble.

Suffer, Rikku heard the voice say before her own mouth opened without 
her control.

&quot;Yuffie... can&#39;t you see I love you? I love you! Do you love me?&quot; Rikku 
spoke, not believing the words as they emerged. Not like this, she 
fought for control, not like this please.

Yuffie stared in silence at Rikku. Her mouth opened and closed once or 
twice.

&quot;She&#39;s in a trance, she might not be herself.&quot; The doctor stated.

&quot;She does love you, stupid child! Go on; tell her she&#39;s an idiot. Tell 
you her you don&#39;t love her!&quot; Rikku yelled.

&quot;She hardly even knows me... but I don&#39;t blame her anyway.&quot; Yuffie said 
to the ghost, her head tilted to one side, eyeing Rikku over. Was it 
lies?

&quot;Oh but she burns for you, you should feel it, she wants to touch you, 
to feel your skin, to press her lips against yours, to run her fingers 
over your soft, naked body as you lie asleep at night.&quot; Rikku stated, 
tears forming in her eyes as her own mind fought to stop herself 
talking.

&quot;Well... I am pretty hot.&quot; Yuffie mumbled. She stared at Rikku and 
wondered how the ghost knew. The image of Rikku doing any of those 
things was making her skin tingle in very personal places. Her usual 
response to the advances of suitors had always been &#39;yuck&#39;. However...

&quot;Well? Say something! Wait!&quot;

Yuffie looked up at Rikku and then down at the floor again. The words 
replayed again... &#39;wants to touch you&#39;. Yuffie stroked at her own cheek 
while she thought.

&quot;No Yuffie it wasn&#39;t me! I swear I would never hurt you I swear I 
wouldn&#39;t it wasn&#39;t me!&quot; Rikku broke free of the trance and sobbed as 
Yuffie stared with a blank unfocused stare.

&quot;Oh... so you don&#39;t then. Oh ... okay then.&quot; Yuffie shrugged, &quot;It was 
just the ghost saying that ... right?&quot;

&quot;Yes! It was just the ghost!&quot; Rikku took a few deep breaths, back in her 
body. It ached like it had been punched all night.

&quot;So you don&#39;t really love me then.&quot; Yuffie mumbled, her eyes fell to the 
floor.

&quot;...&quot; Rikku was stopped short. She looked at Yuffie, who frowned as much 
as to suggest she was ashamed at the thought but Rikku still couldn&#39;t 
say she didn&#39;t. &quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t ... I mean... we could just 
forget all of that right? I mean... you know...&quot;

Yuffie shrugged again. &quot;Sure.&quot; She heard the words again. &#39;Its not that 
I don&#39;t&#39;. A grin assaulted her face. She looked up at Rikku again, &quot;So 
you do love me?&quot; The grin spread. Her heart banged away so loud she was 
sure the room could hear it.

Rikku looked into Yuffie&#39;s eyes and couldn&#39;t bring herself to say no. 
Yuffie was smiling.

&quot;She hates you!! She thinks you&#39;re a fool!!&quot; the voice yelled from 
within.

&quot;You think I&#39;m a fool?&quot; Rikku asked, though she wasn&#39;t sure who had 
asked.

Yuffie tilted her head to one side, grinning so much she felt she might 
start laughing, &quot;Nahhhh! You&#39;re cool! I can&#39;t help it if I&#39;m a babe!&quot; 
Her stomach was twisting itself into a knot as she spoke, she wanted to 
laugh and cry and dance at once. Her hands wringing in her lap as she 
giggled and gasped for air.

&#39;She hates you!&#39; the voice almost pleaded now.

----------

&quot;What do mean by that?&quot; Zidane asked.

Kuja gave him a serious frown, &quot;Zidane. You have to let me go. I can&#39;t 
be here. The mirror is just a reflection of whoever is looking into it. 
I am here Zidane, with you, I never left. I am just your memory, twisted 
by your own thoughts.&quot;

&quot;In ... me?&quot; Zidane stood up and tried to walk. His legs failed and he 
collapsed onto the floor. He closed his eyes. &quot;I was here all along. But 
you believed in me and I could not hurt you. So I became something more 
than the other ghosts.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Zidane felt the cold floor against his cheeks. &quot;For me to stay 
would put you in danger. Please let me go.&quot;

Zidane thumped the floor with his fist. He knew all he had to do was 
accept it and he would be gone. He understood. Just a memory. Just one 
memory had made all the difference. &quot;I understand what you will lose.&quot;

&quot;You could have been...&quot; Zidane cried out. He pounded the floor with his 
fist while the hot tears ran across the floorboards. &quot;So much more. In 
real life I was not what I could have been, these are your memories. All 
I could have been, you gave to me.&quot;

----------

&quot;It&#39;s Seymour. The ghost.&quot; Rikku sighed. She sat up and took another 
deep breath, &quot;But he&#39;s dead... how is he in my head?&quot;

&quot;Kick his butt! I&#39;ll kick his butt, send him to my head!&quot; Yuffie punched 
at the air.

Garnet broke free of her stunned shock and walked to the door, &quot;I might 
go and find Zidane. He knows what this is all about.&quot; She left, giving 
Yuffie a quick puzzled glance as she did so.

&quot;Well I must say!&quot; The doctor sighed.

Harried nodded slowly. &quot;I think,&quot; she said as she twisted her apron in 
her hands, &quot;I think I might go and get us a cup of tea. Yes. That would 
be nice. A cup of tea. Yes...&quot;

&quot;Who is this guy anyway?&quot; Yuffie asked.

&quot;Just ... someone. He was... he was... evil!&quot; Rikku scowled. She shook 
her head, &quot;I don&#39;t wanna talk about him... it was a long time ago. We 
killed... well... or was he already dead?... I don&#39;t care! I just want 
him out of my head!!&quot;

&quot;So ...&quot; Yuffie wanted to ask again. Just one more time. Just to make 
sure. She looked into Rikku&#39;s frightened eyes and lost her nerve. Just a 
ghost. Who cares who Rikku loves? What does it matter? Why do I care?

Rikku lowered her head and curled up into a ball on the bed. Yuffie 
watched again, helpless, as she sobbed.

&quot;Hey ... hey... we&#39;ll kick it&#39;s butt. We will.&quot; Yuffie mumbled. She 
swallowed the tears down as they emerged. Geez I&#39;m turning into a sook 
like her now!

&quot;What are we waiting around here for!?&quot; Yuffie yelled and stood up, 
&quot;We&#39;re going to that mirror guy again and right now!! Or else!!&quot;

&quot;Young lady, I think it&#39;s best we stay here until we are told.&quot; The 
doctor stated. Yuffie flicked him off and grabbed Rikku&#39;s arm, pulling 
her up.

&quot;Come on Rikku, we&#39;ll go get the guy to fix you like he did with the 
kid. If he doesn&#39;t I&#39;ll smash his stupid mirror! Come on!&quot;

She hauled Rikku into a sitting position, &quot;Yuffie I can hardly move on 
my own.&quot; Rikku shook with effort as she tried to position her legs.

&quot;I&#39;ll carry you!&quot; Yuffie threw Rikku&#39;s arm around her shoulder and 
staggered up.

&quot;You can&#39;t carry her like that young lady!&quot; the doctor yelled.

&quot;Bugger off you old fart!&quot; Yuffie yelled back.

&quot;Well I never!&quot;

&quot;Old Coot! Don&#39;t just stand there! HELP!&quot; Yuffie ordered as she faltered 
under Rikku&#39;s awkward weight, she stumbled then fell backward as Rikku 
slid off the bed and pinned her to the ground.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Rikku cried and used what little strength she had left to 
push herself off Yuffie who lay still underneath her.

&quot;Can&#39;t you stand?&quot; Yuffie sat up and put her arm around Rikku&#39;s shoulder 
and heaved her into a sitting position once more.

&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot; Rikku took a deep breath, her muscles were jelly. She could 
tell it was Seymour&#39;s doing, his ghost was a heavy weight in her chest.

----------

Garnet pushed against the door to the storeroom, it was wide open. 
No-one was inside. The mirror reflected the other side of the room. She 
paused in front of it for a moment, contemplating the ragged young woman 
who stood before her.

&quot;Where is he?&quot; she walked back out and closed the door, bolting it shut. 
As she walked away she thought, for a moment, she heard a little voice 
that almost seemed to be chatting away aimlessly to itself in the way of 
children everywhere. 

Eiko leaned her head against the cold metal bench and pushed the little 
toy train across the clean surface. It rolled a little way forward and 
then rolled back to her finger. She sighed and pushed it again. The 
cooks worked and ordered each other around as though she weren&#39;t there 
at all. Eiko allowed herself to drift half asleep as she relaxed her 
tired mind. It was nice not to have to worry. It was nice just to be 
bored again. Every so often she flicked her eyes to the ceiling just to 
be sure. Each time she studied the cracks in the plaster with renewed 
hope that she would soon not need to check. She flicked the train again, 
daydreaming of nothing in particular. She remembered what Zidane had 
told her after she&#39;d been &#39;cured&#39;. It was just a ghost of her memory. It 
wasn&#39;t real. It had power because she believed it did. &#39;That doesn&#39;t 
make any sense anyway... if I believed the train had power it wouldn&#39;t 
just make it have power... would it?&#39; The train rolled slowly backwards 
due to the tilt of the bench. Eiko flicked it again, &#39;and what about me? 
What if I believed I had power? Or does it only work with memories? What 
about my other memories?&#39; the train rolled to the other end of the bench 
and stopped.

&quot;Eiko, it doesn&#39;t work like that.&quot; The familiar voice of Mog echoed into 
her mind.

&quot;Mog! Are you a ghost?&quot; Eiko sat up and looked about the room.

&quot;No.&quot; The voice faded. The train rolled back to Eiko.

&quot;Mog?&quot;

&quot;Mog?&quot;

&#39;Be careful Eiko&#39;.

----------

&quot;Zidane,&quot; Garnet walked out onto the balcony, &quot;there you are.&quot;

Zidane was slumped over against the balustrade.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Garnet placed a hand on his back. He was shaking. 
Garnet could see tears falling, catching the sun as they drifted down.

Zidane coughed as he tried to speak, &quot;... a proper... burial... 
proper... for ...&quot;.

Garnet leaned into his body and hugged him tight. She closed her eyes 
and sighed. For the first time she understood, truly understood why he 
believed. He had little in the way of true family. Kuja was as close as 
he was ever going to get. Garland didn&#39;t count in Zidane&#39;s mind but Kuja 
had given Zidane a glimpse of someone who never got a chance to be.

----------

Beatrix watched the airship as it docked and watched a number of people 
disembark. They wore grim faces and white coats.

&quot;It&#39;s not good news.&quot; Aldebert stated as he watched by her side.

&quot;They came back with something again. They should leave those things 
where they are.&quot; Beatrix watched a couple of the men carry a large 
wooden crate from the ship.

One of the white coats walked toward the couple. He carried a roll of 
paper under one arm.

&quot;The drawings.&quot; Beatrix stated.

&quot;The girls said it was all dead.&quot;

&quot;But still.&quot;

He stopped and placed the roll on the ground and unfurled it, the end 
just reaching the tip of Beatrix&#39;s foot. The drawing was of the whole 
island, showing in clear detail the site of the old Iifa tree. As had 
been stated, it was all dead.

&quot;All dead.&quot; He repeated.

The white coat approached.

&quot;It looks dead. Until you see it at night. And not every night mind. We 
got lucky the third night.&quot; He bent down and lifted the paper; another 
drawing underneath was black with a myriad of white streaks, like the 
roots of a tree, snaking around the island.

&quot;What...&quot; Beatrix breathed and bent down to see closer detail, it had 
been drawn from the airship, &quot;It&#39;s growing again?&quot;

&quot;Only if it&#39;s growing upside down!&quot; The white coat stated, &quot;The picture 
really doesn&#39;t show the reality. It only glowed some of the time. It 
sort of pulsated. Just a few times. Then it went dead... well... back to 
... I would assume a dormant state.&quot;

&quot;It does look like it&#39;s growing upside down...&quot; Steiner added.

&quot;We don&#39;t think it&#39;s the same thing. To be honest, we really don&#39;t 
know.&quot; The white coat picked the end of the paper up and rolled it back 
across the ground. He picked up the roll and walked back to the couple.

&quot;Shall we inform his and her majesties?&quot;

&quot;As if they need more troubles.&quot; Steiner sighed.
