<h1>Sayoko and Biko</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mguard.html">Anonymous</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Biko Daitokuji rested her hands lightly on her balcony&#39;s balustrade, 
gazing over the Daitokuji estate&#39;s large and highly manicured garden. 
It was early march and the sakura were slowly coming into bloom. Their 
faint fragrance could be detected on the chill air that lightly blew 
Biko&#39;s lavender hair and her near diaphanous nightgown.

She rested her elbows on the cool stone balustrade and held her chin 
in her hands, letting her thoughts drift away with the wind. She 
looked down towards one of the garden&#39;s many fountains and spotted her 
father talking to a tall man wearing a brown gi. The man placed a 
cigarette between his lips and Biko&#39;s father lit it.

Another business transaction, Biko thought, doesn&#39;t father care for 
anything else? Biko recognized the man as Soun Tendo, a respected 
martial arts instructor who happened to own some prime Tokyo real 
estate. Shaking her head, Biko went back into her room, closing the 
balcony&#39;s doors behind her.

She stretched languidly, and seated herself at her desk. She was 
working on yet another mecha that she was sure that bitch Eiko would 
be able to defeat almost instantly. She was almost ready to stop 
trying. Her power suit had been the best bet, and although she had 
been able to fight Eiko more effectively Biko had always been defeated 
at the end, so she decided to start making Eiko fight her mechs again, 
but all to no avail. Sighing, Biko tossed her pencil to the table.

She decided that she needed to get away from the mansion for a little 
while and try to forger about her darling Shiko and that bitch Eiko. 
She picked up her cellular phone and called one of her few friends 
Sayoko Mishima.After the phone rang six times a cotton mouthed Sayoko 
answered the phone.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Sayoko, it&#39;s Biko. I was just calling to see what you are up to 
today. I&#39;m bored stiff over here.

Biko could almost hear the gears turning inside Sayoko&#39;s head. Sayoko 
suffered from unrequited love also, so Biko felt that she could 
communicate better with Sayoko than anyone else. It didn&#39;t hurt that 
Sayoko was rich also. Although not as wealthy as Hikaru Daitokuji, 
Sayoko&#39;s father had carved out quite a niche for himself, so Biko did 
not have to worry about Sayoko fawning over her like so many others 
did.

&quot;Hi, Biko,&quot; A little life had come to Sayoko&#39;s voice when she realized 
who she was talking to, &quot;how have you been, sweetie?&quot;

&quot;Nothing has changed really. That bitch Eiko has defeated all of my 
creations and Shiko has still not chosen me over her? How about you 
and Keiichi?&quot;

There was humorless laughter on the other end of the phone. I am in 
the same boat with you, Biko; Morisato is rammed so far up Belldandy&#39;s 
ass I can see him smiling when she opens her mouth.&quot;

Biko couldn&#39;t help giggling a bit. So, would you like to spend the day 
together? It has been a while since I have seen you last, and I could 
use some of Sayoko&#39;s special loving.

More laughter. &quot;Eiko most have really gotten you down, Biko. You are 
practically begging me, and you know how much I like it when you beg!&quot;

Biko smiled wickedly. &quot;I seem to remember you begging a few times 
there also, Sayoko, You know I can dish out more than I receive.

&quot;Oh? Is that a challenge? Well, Biko, I&#39;ll be by to pick you up in two 
hours. Be waiting for me, or I might have to give you a spanking right 
then and there!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be ready. Don&#39;t you worry about that! Bye, Sayoko, I&#39;ll see you 
soon.&quot;

&quot;Bye, Biko.&quot;

After Sayoko hung up, Biko clicked off her cell phone.

Shiko, I can never put you out of my heart completely, but I can hide 
you away for a little while. Biko slipped the spaghetti straps from 
her shoulders and let her nightgown fall to the floor. Her beautiful 
body was illuminated by pale sunlight shining through her gauzy 
curtains. Humming a sad, Biko made her way to her bathroom to take a 
quick bath.

Biko closed the door to her large bathroom. One of the maids had 
already drawn a bath for her so the room was full of steam. Biko 
wrapped her long lavender tresses in a towel and sat on a short stool 
that stood in front of a low sink and a couple of washtubs made of 
pine. She filled one of the tubs with hot water and poured the water 
down her shoulders. She loved the way the hot water caressed her 
shoulders, breasts, the way it traveled down her back and between her 
buttocks. She picked up a bottle of liquid soap and squirted a bit of 
the translucent liquid on a sponge and started to clean her body. She 
first washed her neck and shoulders. The natural sponge&#39;s roughness 
felt wonderful on her milky skin. She rubbed it between her breasts, 
and then under them. Her nipples that had been as hard as pink stones 
had softened during her bathing. She completed washing her breasts and 
taught stomach, and began to bathe her long slender legs. She held 
each leg up one at a time to inspect how well she cleaned herself. 
Biko filled the washtub again with hot water and rinsed off.

She smiled when she saw how the hot bath had turned her skin the color 
of a pale pink rose. That tomboy Eiko could never compare to me. Biko 
stood and made her way to the large bathtub. She eased her way into 
the scalding hot water, cringing as she lowered her body into its 
depths. She felt her body tighten up when the water touched the tender 
skin of her vagina and anus. But after her backside touched the smooth 
stone bottom of the tub, she released a long stream of air between her 
teeth and relaxed in the tub&#39;s hot water.

Biko looked up at a digital clock on the wall. 11:20 AM. She still had 
an hour and forty minutes to get ready before Sayoko arrived. She 
decided to have a little fun before the dark haired college student&#39;s 
arrival. Biko slid her right arm back into the water and brought it to 
her left breast.

She caressed it, cradling it from below. She raised her thumb and 
index finger, and squeezed her nipple hard. A shot of pain and 
pleasure shot throughout her body. She could especially feel it in her 
womanhood. Biko glided her left hand through the water until she held 
it above her pubic area. She lowered it, and played with her dark 
lavender pubic hair. She then opened her legs a bit, and let her 
slender finger&#39;s press lightly upon her vagina&#39;s lips. She could feel 
sweat droplets pour down her face. She played with herself with two 
fingers, rubbing the tender flesh lightly, but hard enough to send 
jolts of pleasure through her body. She inserted the two fingers into 
her vagina, and pushed them in as deep as they could go. She could 
feel her heart pounding deeply within her chest, and could feel the 
blood pumping in her temples. Biko moved her fingers slowly inside 
her, but before she could reach climax she pulled them out of her. She 
lifted them out of the water and brought them to her mouth and licked 
them. Although they had been underwater, Biko could still detect her 
unique taste. She was now extraordinarily horny, but was willing to 
wait for Sayoko to get her completely off.

Looking up at the clock, Biko noticed that another fifteen minutes had 
passed. She could easily let herself fall asleep in the warm depths of 
the tub, but she had promised Sayoko that she would be ready. Biko 
also knew that Sayoko&#39;s threat was not an empty one. She had found 
herself over the dark haired girl&#39;s knee on several occasions, and it 
was a good deal more painful than just a few playful smacks.

Biko stood and her flushed pink skin gave off fine tendrils of steam. 
She pulled a large towel off a bronze hoop, and patted herself dry. 
After she finished drying herself, Biko took the towel off of her head 
and shook out her mane of lavender hair that fell just below the swell 
of her buttocks. Wrapping the fluffy towel just above her full 
breasts, Biko walked into her bedroom. She dressed quickly, putting on 
a yellow sundress, a pair of white panties, and a pair of sandals. 
Biko had never liked makeup, so she only put on a bit of light pink 
lipstick. She brushed her hair one hundred times with a tortoise shell 
hairbrush, and hurried back into the restroom to brush her teeth. 
Exiting the restroom, Biko took one last glance at herself in the 
vanity mirror.

&quot;What a knockout! Sayoko would cream her panties when she sees me if 
she ever actually wore panties. Biko laughed an evil girl laugh and 
made her way downstairs to wait for Sayoko.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Sayoko put the receiver back in its cradle and looked at the clock on 
her night table. 11:00 am the mother of pearl inlaid hands of the 
clock read. She licked her lips trying to get some moisture to form in 
her mouth. She had a long night of drinking the night before, and 
really didn&#39;t remember coming home. She looked under the covers to see 
if she was wearing any clothes. She was. She was wearing a pair of 
gray silk pajamas.

How in the world did I get into these pajamas? And how did I get home. 
Sayoko spent many a night binge drinking, but most of the time she had 
left in the company of some random guy, and he brought her home, 
unless she was horny enough to spend the night at his place. Last 
night, however, she knew that she drove herself to the bar. She had 
been intending on grabbing only a couple of drinks and maybe catching 
a late night movie, but she had found a guy there who listened without 
comment to all that she had to say so she spilt out a bit of the 
poison that had been accumulating in her heart. Well as time went on 
and the number of drinks mounted up Sayoko got very drunk, and even 
after her sympathetic ear had excused himself she continued drinking 
glass after glass of alcohol. Beyond that Sayoko couldn&#39;t remember a 
thing. It was then she noticed a glass of water sitting on top of her 
vanity. Underneath the glass there was a neatly folded piece of paper.

Sayoko picked up the glass of water and took a sip. After placing the 
water back on the vanity she picked up the folded piece of paper. 
Written in flowery script was her name. The neat kanji were obviously 
written by a girl. Sayoko felt her heart sink as she unfolded the 
paper. Her fears were confirmed: Belldandy had written the note.

Sayoko gritted her teeth the second time she read the note. Apparently 
she had called the Keiichi Morisato, and begged him to come see her at 
the bar. Keiichi being concerned rode up to the bar with Belldandy and 
his little sister Megumi. Lucky for Sayoko Megumi had been there since 
Keiichi only had a motorcycle. Belldandy wrote that they had brought 
Sayoko and that she and Megumi had helped Sayoko into her pajamas. 
Belldandy also wrote for Sayoko to be sure to drink the glass of water 
because it had a little medicine added to it to help with her 
hangover.

Sayoko downed the glass of water, and slammed it down on her vanity. 
Fuck! Not only do I make an ass of myself I have to do it in front of 
Keiichi and that cumrag Belldandy had to help me when I was too drunk 
to take care of myself. Sayoko&#39;s anger rose even more when she saw the 
clothes she wore the night before neatly folded on her desk.

After breathing in a deep breath, Sayoko released it slowly between 
her clenched teeth. She looked at herself in the vanity mirror. Her 
raven black hair was a bit tousled and there were dark rings under her 
eyes, but she still looked better than most other girls when they were 
dolled up to the hilt. Belldandy though, I bet she never has bad 
mornings, or at least that little snot Keiichi thinks so. I bet he 
can&#39;t wait to lick her asshole and tell her it tastes as sweet as it 
smells. Sayoko laughed bitterly. Well at least that stuff she mixed in 
the water got rid of my hangover.

She was glad Biko had called. It would be nice to put Keiichi and 
Belldandy out of her head for a little while without the aid of 
alcohol. She was looking forward to spending a little quality time 
with the Daitokuji girl.Sayoko smiled she could already taste Biko&#39;s 
skin and juices that welled up between the girl&#39;s legs.

Laughing, Sayoko slipped out of her pajamas, and walked towards her 
restroom her long black hair cascading in silken folds behind her. 
Nothing better to start your day than fooling around with a not so 
innocent high school girl is there? She thought while smiling 
mischievously.

After bathing, Sayoko emerged from her restroom with steam rising from 
her flushed skin. She tossed aside her towel, and opened up the top 
drawer of her dresser. She took out a very skimpy black thong and a 
lacey black bra. She eased on the thong, turned to get a look at her 
shapely behind in a full-length mirror, and smiled. She then slipped 
on her bra and fastened the clasp at the front. She moved into her 
walk in closet and pondered what blouse and skirt to wear. When she 
picked out a blouse made of dark blue silk her phone started ringing. 
She hurried out of her closet and answered it.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Miss Mishima?&quot; said a very sweet concerned voice on the other end.

&quot;Hi, Belldandy, how are you?&quot; Sayoko could almost feel the bile rising 
in her throat. Just talking to Belldandy infuriated her.

&quot;I&#39;m just calling to see if you are feeling well this morning, and to 
tell you not to worry about Megumi&#39;s shirt it came clean in the wash.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Belldandy. I am feeling fine now; I was just getting ready 
to go out for a while. That medicine you gave me seems to have done 
the trick. I do not feel sick at all.&quot;

&quot;That is wonderful! Well, Miss Mishima, I have to go now and prepare 
lunch for Keiichi and my sisters. I hope to see you soon. Bye!

&quot;Bye.&quot; After Belldandy had hung up Sayoko slammed the receiver back in 
its cradle. &quot;God damn, bitch calling me like that! Rubbing it in that 
I have fallacies unlike her! Oh, I bet she loved seeing me in a 
vulnerable state! I&#39;ll get her one of these days!&quot;

Grumbling, Sayoko went back inside her closet and put on a pair of 
black panty hose with a flower pattern. She decided that she would 
wear the dark blue silk blouse with a short black leather skirt. She 
accented the articles of clothing with a black leather belt with a 
slim silver buckle and a pair of black high heels. She moved back to 
her vanity and brushed out her gorgeous black hair until it glowed 
with an internal luster. She put on a pair of simple silver hoop 
earrings, and applied a small amount of makeup. Satisfied, she grabbed 
her purse and made her way downstairs to the garage. She had decided 
that she would drive her father&#39;s Mercedes that day.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Biko heard Sayoko pull into the driveway, but made no movement to get 
up. She listened to the sharp clicks and clacks of Sayoko&#39;s heels as 
she made her way to the front door. Sayoko ringed the doorbell, and 
Mozart&#39; s Magic Flute filled the massive Daitokuji Mansion.

Biko stood and walked leisurely over to the front door. She looked 
through the peephole at Sayoko. Sayoko had her arms folded underneath 
her breasts and had her lips twisted in consternation. Biko opened the 
door.

&quot;Hello, Sayoko, it is so nice to see you.&quot;

Sayoko&#39; s frown disappeared. She walked up to Biko and kissed the 
shorter girl on the cheek. &quot;Are you ready to go?&quot; Sayoko asked. Her 
dark sunglasses made Sayoko look like a sexy movie star or the wife of 
a high-ranking yakuza, Biko thought.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve been ready. I didn&#39;t want to start our day with my getting 
spanked. Not that I wouldn&#39;t mind on later!&quot;

Sayoko and Biko laughed together.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Biko, I am sure it will happen before the evening is 
over!&quot; Sayoko wrapped an arm around Biko&#39;s shoulders. &quot;I&#39;m starved. 
Lets go get something good to eat.

&quot;There you go again thinking with your stomach,&quot; Biko rolled her 
eyes.Sayoko let her arm slide from Biko&#39;s shoulders. She gave Biko&#39;s 
bottom a smart smack with the palm of her hand. Biko yelped more from 
surprise than from pain.

Sayoko hooked her left arm around Biko&#39;s right. &quot;You among all people 
should know that I need a full stomach to perform certain activities 
correctly.&quot;

Biko snuggled up closely to Sayoko, and kissed one of Sayoko&#39;s ear 
lobes. She then whispered, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want you anyway but at your top 
form.&quot;

&quot;Baby, you don&#39;t deserve anything less!&quot; Sayoko nuzzled her face close 
to Biko&#39;s and searched for the lavender haired girl&#39;s full lips. They 
exchanged a short but passionate kiss.

&quot;I am lucky to have a friend like you, Sayoko. You make all of my 
worries fade away.&quot;

&quot;As you do mine.&quot;

Sayoko and Biko seated themselves in Sayoko&#39;s father&#39;s Mercedes. 
Sayoko turned on the radio, and Nanase Aikawa&#39;s &quot;Bad Girls&quot; was 
playing. How appropriate they both thought. They sped away to eat at a 
restaurant that served excellent Kobe beef.

Sayoko slid the keycard into the slot and opened the door to a 
luxurious penthouse apartment. Biko entered the apartment and bent 
over to remove her sandals. Sayoko, after sliding of her heels, closed 
the door. She walked slowly over to Biko, and gave the lavender haired 
girl&#39;s bottom a smack. Biko yelped more out of surprise than from 
pain.

When Biko started to stand, Sayoko placed her right hand on Biko&#39;s 
back. &quot;I like you in that position.

&quot;Yes. Sayoko.&quot; Biko&#39;s voice shuddered with both trepidation and 
desire.

&quot;Grab your ankles.&quot; Biko did as she was told.

Sayoko pulled up Biko&#39;s sundress revealing Biko&#39;s pantied rear end. 
Sayoko eased two fingers under the elastic band, and slowly pulled 
Biko&#39;s panties down. Sayoko rubbed Biko&#39;s pale cheeks with her right 
hand, caressing and fondling the younger girl&#39;s buttocks.

&quot;Are you ready, Biko?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sayoko.&quot; Biko&#39;s voice trembled.

Sayoko put her left hand on Biko&#39;s back to hold her in place, and 
hefted her right hand. She smacked Biko&#39;s left buttock three times and 
then did the same to the left home. The sound of flesh on flesh echoed 
throughout the room. Sayoko continued this pattern, turning Biko&#39;s 
cheeks from cream white to rosy pink.

She stopped and rubbed Biko&#39;s sore cheeks. &quot;I don&#39;t think I am doing 
this well enough, Biko. Remove your sandals, and go bend over one of 
the couch&#39;s arms.&quot;

Biko removed her sandals, but when she started towards the couch 
Sayoko grabbed her elbow.

Sayoko smiled, flashing her pearly teeth. &quot;Actually, Biko there is one 
more thing that I want you to do for me. Lift your arms.&quot;

After Biko did as she was told, Sayoko walked up to her, removed the 
spaghetti straps from Biko&#39;s shoulders, and pulled her dress down. 
Sayoko walked around the lavender haired beauty, stroking various 
parts of her body. Biko&#39;s pink bottom contrasted nicely with the 
creaminess of her skin and the translucent pink of her nipples. Sayoko 
pointed to one of the couch&#39;s arms and snapped her fingers. Biko moved 
hastily over to the couch and bent over the arm, pointing her butt 
towards the roof.

&quot;Good girl,&quot; Sayoko said, unbuckling her belt. She pulled it through 
the loops of her skirt and doubled it over. She held it high and 
lashed Biko a few times with it. Welts rose on Biko&#39;s fine flesh. 
Sayoko tossed her belt to the floor when she saw Biko&#39;s shoulders 
heaving slightly and heard Biko&#39;s sobs.

Sayoko knelt before the couch, and brushed Biko&#39;s hair away from her 
face. She leaned in and kissed the weeping girl&#39;s eyelids, sucking 
away the tears. She kissed Biko sweetly on the mouth. I&#39;ll give you 
something nice now, Biko.&quot;

Sayoko stood and moved back behind Biko. She lightly touched Biko&#39;s 
sore cheeks, rubbing them ever so lightly. She enjoyed greatly the 
feel of heat rising from Biko&#39;s spanked flesh.

&quot;Spread your legs for me.&quot; Biko spread her legs as far as she could, 
revealing her moist vagina. Sayoko fell to her knees behind Biko, and 
spread the heiress of the Daitokuji Fortune with her left hand. She 
licked slightly at the tender flesh in between the swollen lips.

Biko moaned slightly.

Sayoko moved in closer and pressed her tongue in deeper. She licked 
deeply, darting her tongue inside Biko&#39;s vagina. Withdrawing her 
tongue, Sayoko inserted her index and middle finger inside of Biko and 
pushed them deeply inside the girl, She pushed them in all the way to 
her knuckles. She wiggled her fingers around a bit inside, causing 
Biko&#39;s breath to quicken. She started thrusting her fingers inside and 
out. Sayoko watched Biko&#39;s bottom sway slightly with every thrust.

&quot;Sayoko, I can&#39;t hold it back anymore! Biko spoke breathily.

&quot;Let it go!&quot;

Biko started to breath through her teeth raggedly, and when a loud 
moan was released from her lips, Sayoko pulled her fingers out of 
Biko&#39;s vagina, and plunged her face back in. Biko&#39;s love juices poured 
freely from her vagina, and Sayoko sucked up every little bit she 
could.

When Biko was breathing at a slower pace Sayoko stood, walked over and 
knelt before the couch again. She leaned over and kissed Biko 
tenderly.

&quot;Are you ready to go to bed?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I am not ready to sleep.&quot;

&quot;Did you really think I had sleep in mind?&quot;

Sayoko and Biko laughed their evil laughs together.</pre>
