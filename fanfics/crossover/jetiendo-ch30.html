birthday?&quot;

&quot;No&quot; Ash replied

&quot;Well come on you two,&quot; Tasha gasped, &quot; the guests have been waiting for 
twenty minutes&quot;

So the 3 had to scurry to the banquet hall where the previous party was 
at, he one where Daniel Radcliff beated up Sam Boyle, Where they where 
all greeted by the school trip all but Kotono was there, their banquet 
was full of food it was enough for the whole country. Davis looked at 
Ash while every one stuffed their faces, usually Ash stuffs his face, 
and he was surprised with his manners on the dinner table,

After the banquet the people from the trip went home too dress in their 
Tudor- Victorian fashion.

After the busy afternoon, they where took in a limousine to the castle 
as they all entered the great hall, the ball had started.

They all danced at the ball for a whole hour, they all had a good time, 
they all looked at the food tables after their dance, peppermint 
chocolate cakes, succulent beef, tasty chicken, fresh fruit and 
vegetables, chocolate in all different shapes and sizes, ect, all the 
foods you can think of was theirs to feast upon.

&quot; Good evening&quot; they both said

&quot; I read those chapters&quot; Jade said &quot; I like the one where Harry and 
Hermione fall in love, &quot; then Jade turned around and spotted her brother 
Jordan with an overfilled plate with pasta and another plate of ice 
cream. &quot; excuse me for one second&quot; Jade said to them two, &quot;Jordan&quot; Jade 
snapped at her brother &quot;that&#39;s too much pasta&quot;

&quot;Daniel said I can have what I WANT&quot; Jordan replied

&quot; He didn&#39;t mean pig out.&quot; Jade replied.

&quot;Shut up&quot; Jordan shouted stuffing his face with pasta and ice cream.

Meanwhile Misty and Kari where walking sensibly outside trying to blow 
their cover. As soon as they found a private place outside for the 
desperate gentle kiss, they needed.

&quot;After the ball I was thinking of going out and stay overnight at my 
room in the hotel,&quot; Misty whispered to her neck.

&quot;What&#39;s the hotel called?&quot; Kari smiled at her 15-year-old girlfriend.

&quot; Rosette&quot; Misty blessed at her.

&quot;That&#39;s a pretty name.&quot;

&quot;So should we go now&quot;?

&quot;Yeah why not? Is it far?&quot;

&quot; Just a stroll&quot;

&quot;Ok&quot;

Rosette.
