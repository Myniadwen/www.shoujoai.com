Juri blinked in surprise, seeing the big pile of gifts sitting on the 
bar. &quot;Aren&#39;t these supposed to be by the door?&quot; she asked, looking at 
the much larger stack sitting by the front door. They would be handed 
out to anybody who came in tonight, by Hitomi to start with, then by 
the other staff whenever they could find the time.

&quot;Actually, no,&quot; Nabiki smiled, &quot;those are from and to the staff.&quot;

Juri looked over and realized that, yes, they were all tagged to 
members of the staff. She began to laugh, then got her own bunch of 
gifts out to add to the pile. &quot;So, should we hand them out now?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Why not,&quot; Ryouko laughed. The staff was gathered around the bar and 
with real eagerness the Juri handed her gifts out first. Ryouko tore 
at Juri&#39;s package, then large hearts appeared in her eyes. &quot;Demon 
dance sake! I&#39;ve never been able to afford this before,&quot; she sighed.

Sasami laughed softly, quickly pulling on her gift. &quot;Kiss the cook,&quot; 
it read boldly, and the obviously custom made cartoon on it depicted a 
chibi Sasami and Minagi kissing. &quot;Thank you very much,&quot; Sasami said, 
beaming at Juri.

Minagi was blushing faintly. She carefully opened her gift, and began 
to laugh. A T-shirt, with the same image as Sasami&#39;s, saying &quot;Kiss the 
cook&#39;s girlfriend!&quot;

Excel helped Hyatt open up her gift, and both of them chuckled. It was 
a personalized first aid kit, with all the trimmings. &quot;Thank you, 
Juri,&quot; Hyatt managed weakly.

A pair of chibi Excel and Hyatt dolls lay in Excel&#39;s box, holding each 
other close. &quot;So kawaii,&quot; Excel sighed happily, crushing the dolls to 
her.

Bones slid on the high quality, padded leather gloves slowly, savoring 
the feeling. The black hared girl grinned as she said, &quot;Thanks boss.&quot; 
She cracked her knuckles once for emphasis before heading towards the 
doors.

Nabiki blinked in surprise, noticing that her gift was just a small 
card. She opened it, and her eyes grew wide, then she looked up at 
Juri with tears in her eyes. &quot;Thank you!&quot; and she threw her arms 
around Juri&#39;s neck.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Keiko asked, surprised..

&quot;An invitation from my father,&quot; Nabiki said softly, &quot;I&#39;m invited home 
for Christmas.&quot; She met Juri&#39;s eyes, &quot;I don&#39;t know how you managed 
this, but thank you.&quot;

&quot;So why&#39;s that so important?&quot; Hyatt asked Keiko quietly.

&quot;Nabiki got tossed out of the house when her father found out she was 
gay,&quot; Keiko explained equally quietly, &quot;He could accept Ranma and 
Akane together because of the curse he&#39;s under, but apparently not 
Nabiki.&quot;

Hitomi blushed furiously, quickly closing the box. She noticed the 
confused looks she was getting and explained, &quot;It&#39;s a naughty 
school-girl costume!&quot;

Juri grinned, &quot;Well, you&#39;re always wearing you old school uniform.&quot; 
She paused, adding, &quot;I&#39;m sure Milerna will like it, too.&quot;

Hitomi blushed even brighter at that.

May decided to take mercy on Hitomi, drawing everyone&#39;s attention to 
her as she gently unwrapped her own package. She smiled happily, 
holding up the crisp new maid&#39;s uniform up to her, &quot;Thank you, 
Juri-sama.&quot;

&quot;Keiko, why not open yours next,&quot; Juri suggested.

Keiko looked at her curiously, then nodded. The wrapping paper fell 
aside, then her eyes widened. The black men&#39;s suit was obviously 
tailored to her, and looked like it would fit like a glove. &quot;Thank 
you,&quot; Keiko said softly, noticing the admiring gaze May was giving 
her. &quot;Would you mind if I wear it tonight?&quot; she suddenly asked.

&quot;Go for it,&quot; Juri smiled, and both May and Keiko rushed off to get 
changed. She looked over at the others, &quot;Let&#39;s open the rest later. I 
promise to open my gift&#39;s in front of you before we all go home.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll hold you to that,&quot; Excel warned her.

They then broke up and scattered to prepare for the Christmas party. 
Excel and Hyatt made sure the tables were draped with garlands, and 
all had red and green tablecloths. &quot;Ready!&quot; Hyatt exclaimed right 
before collapsing again.

Ryouko and Minagi checked the fridge for the extra eggnog, and that 
all the mixers were ready. A teat run of the red and green colored 
beers were performed, and it tasted fine. &quot;We&#39;re ready over here, 
Juri,&quot; Minagi reported.

Nabiki stuck her head out of the karaoke room to say, &quot;The Christmas 
songs are all loaded up and ready to go.&quot;

Keiko came out into the main room, and looked quite transformed. The 
black suit was stylish, hugging her like a glove, and she had taken 
her hair out of it&#39;s ponytails. Instead, a single braid ran down her 
back, giving her a much more handsome look.

May gently took Keiko&#39;s arm, smiling at her warmly in her crisp black 
and white maid&#39;s outfit. They looked like a matched set, and certainly 
made quite the couple. &quot;Let&#39;s test out the sound system,&quot; May 
volunteered, pulling Keiko to the dance floor.

&#39;Sometimes, love can,&#39; started up, as Keiko gently led May across the 
dance floor. They swayed gently, their bodies close together, 
seemingly lost in each other&#39;s eyes. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Keiko murmured 
softly, and gently kissed May.

&quot;About time,&quot; Juri muttered softly.

Sasami stuck her head out of the kitchen, &quot;The first few turkey&#39;s are 
done!&quot; She saw the two dancing, and sighed softly, &quot;Kawaii.&quot;

Juri checked the time, then raised her voice to declare, &quot;OK, it&#39;s 
time to go!&quot; She went over and unlocked the doors, even as the others 
rushed to their places.

Haruka was the first in, Michiru just behind her. &quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; 
Michiru said, gently hugging Juri with a smile.

&quot;We can&#39;t stay all evening,&quot; Haruka said reluctantly, &quot;the Senshi&#39;s 
party is later tonight. But I wanted to be here tonight.&quot;

&quot;Good to see you,&quot; Juri grinned, even as a beaming Hitomi passed them 
their gifts. Juri felt a pang of disappointment at not seeing Setsuna 
with them, a feeling that surprised her a little. She had only met the 
elegant, beautiful woman twice, so why was she feeling like this?

&quot;Setsuna and the others will be by soon,&quot; Michiru said with a little 
smile on her face, and almost had to laugh at the look on Juri&#39;s face.

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Juri answered, trying to act casual. She saw more 
people coming, and excused herself.

&quot;Interesting, very interesting,&quot; Haruka remarked.

Juri was a bit surprised to see some newcomers, tonight of all nights. 
The one lady had long brown hair, reaching her waist, and wore a 
rather formal looking dress. She hung on the arm of a much more modern 
looking young lady with shorter, darker brown hair.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been in a place like this before, Linna,&quot; the 
long haired girl said to the other girl a bit shyly.

Linna smiled down at her comfortingly before saying, &quot;If it gets 
uncomfortable, we can always leave, Belldandy.&quot;

Priss and Urd followed in right after, and Juri suddenly realized 
where she recognized those two names from. She approached the two and 
smiled, &quot;Hello, I&#39;m Arisugawa Juri. Priss talks about you all the 
time.&quot;

Linna gave Priss a suspicious glance before saying dryly, &quot;Then you 
should probably ignore most of what she said.&quot;

Priss looked wounded, but before she could shoot back a reply, Juri 
took some gifts from the pile and started handing them out with a 
cheery, &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot;

A striking woman with silvery hair followed them in, looking around 
her thoughtfully. Priss stepped up, &quot;Sylia Stingray, meet Arisugawa 
Juri.&quot;

&quot;Charmed,&quot; Juri said, going into her most gentlemanly behavior. She 
gave the gift to Sylia with a smile, letting her fingers gently brush 
the other women&#39;s

The five moved off into the crowd, talking softly. &quot;Did you notice how 
she looked at you?&quot; Hitomi asked quietly.

&quot;She&#39;s taken,&quot; Juri said with a calm little smile.

&quot;What?&quot; Hitomi said, surprised. &quot;How do you know?&quot; she protested.

&quot;Trust me, I know,&quot; Juri said smoothly.

Asuka, Rei, Maya, Ritsuko and Misato all came in together, and soon 
Juri and the others had a bustling crowd to deal with. Misato walked 
over to the bar and grinned at Ryouko, &quot;Try to guess what I&#39;m going to 
order.&quot;

Ryouko grinned back, &quot;Beer.&quot;

Misato pouted, &quot;I guess that was too easy, huh?&quot;

Keiko got a lot of compliments, not to mention a few longing glances, 
because of her new look. &quot;Would you like to order?&quot; she asked, leading 
Maya, Ritsuko, Rei and Asuka over to one of the dining tables.

&quot;Four house specials,&quot; Ritsuko ordered, and a faint blush appeared 
across her cheeks, &quot;could we book an upstairs room for two in an hour, 
as well?&quot;

&quot;Those two are insatiable,&quot; Asuka complained quietly to Rei.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Rei smiled one of her little smiles, &quot;I was thinking 
of booking a room for us, too.&quot; Asuka blushed faintly at that.

Outside the Locket, the snow had begun coming down again. &quot;Hey, 
Sonomi, it&#39;s nice to see you,&quot; the red headed woman said as she 
watched them approach, leaning up against the wall nearest to the 
front door.

Kaho smiled at her, &quot;Good evening, Ranma.&quot; She looked a bit concerned 
as she asked her, &quot;Are you still on bouncer duty?&quot;

Ranma smiled and gave a little shrug. &quot;Until we&#39;re sure that Vegeta 
isn&#39;t going to be coming back here, we&#39;re rotating the duty,&quot; she 
explained. She had just sent Bones in for some Irish coffee, but she 
wasn&#39;t going to distract from her potential heroism.

Ranma&#39;s eyes seemed to light up when she noticed Sakura and Tomoyo 
standing there just behind Sonomi, and she thought &#39;Especially in 
front of two cute young ladies.&#39; Kaho hid a smile, while Sonomi just 
grinned at her.

&quot;Down, girl,&quot; Sonomi chuckled softly, adding, &quot;they&#39;re both taken, 
anyway.&quot; Ranma sighed out her disappointment, and Kaho chuckled 
softly. &quot;Sakura, Tomoyo,&quot; Sonomi said, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Saotome 
Ranma.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; Sakura said with a smile and little bow, 
while Tomoyo murmured her greetings as well.

&quot;Just head on inside,&quot; Ranma commented, as the winter wind whistled 
all around them, &quot;we can talk later.&quot; She pulled open the door and 
waved them all inside.

&quot;Good evening,&quot; a pretty brown hared girl in her school uniform said 
to them with a cheery smile. From a large pile right beside her she 
passed over a brightly wrapped gift to each of the surprised members 
of the party.

&quot;Hi, Hitomi,&quot; Sonomi smiled at her. She shook her gift cautiously, &quot;I 
see Juri&#39;s doing Christmas in style this year. Who went out to buy the 
presents?&quot;

&quot;We split the duty up between everybody,&quot; Hitomi explained. A little 
blush appeared on her cheeks, &quot;I suspect at least some of the gifts 
are a bit... naughty.&quot; A smile, &quot;Would you like a table, or are you 
visiting the bar first?&quot;

&quot;I think our friends need some relaxation medicine, first,&#39; Kaho said, 
smiling at Tomoyo and Sakura. &quot;We&#39;ll see you later, all right?&quot; Hitomi 
gave them a wave as they made their way through the crowd to the bar.

&quot;This place is incredible,&quot; Sakura said, looking around her in awe. It 
was packed, women filling all the tables, lined up along the long bar, 
and covering the dance floor. She carefully shielded Tomoyo from the 
crush, receiving a grateful smile.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Tomoyo said with a smile. A bit more quietly she added, &quot;I 
came here alone once before, but it was quite a while back.&quot; She 
continued softly, &quot;It was long before Sakura moved in with me.&quot;

Both Sonomi and Kaho looked at Sakura, worried about her reaction.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Sakura said, gently taking Tomoyo&#39;s hand in her own. 
&quot;I should know that a beautiful girl like you would have her share of 
suitors,&quot; and she smiled at her widely, &quot;I&#39;m just glad that I&#39;ve got 
you now.&quot;

&quot;That was so sweet,&quot; a red headed girl said, just beside them. All 
four of them startled slightly at her sudden appearance.

&quot;Asuka,&quot; her blue hared companion gently chided her, &quot;I think that was 
meant to be a private romantic moment.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, Rei,&quot; Asuka said, blushing a bit. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said 
with a little bow as Rei pulled her aside.

Sonomi and Kaho were fighting a case of giggles. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Sonomi said, 
finally breaking up laughing as Tomoyo glared at both of them.

They finally reached the bar, and in only a few seconds a woman 
literally appeared from seeming nowhere right in front of them. &quot;What 
can I get you folks?&quot; Minagi asked them all.

&quot;We&#39;ll start with some rum and eggnog, I think,&quot; Sonomi said, looking 
over at the others. She received a chorus of agreeing nods, and Minagi 
disappeared, reappearing in front of a freezer to pour them their 
drinks.

Juri smiled, noticing Sonomi and Kaho standing together at the bar. 
They had really seemed to hit it off the last time they were at the 
bar, and she was glad to see they were still together. The two young 
ladies with them were strangers to her, however.

&quot;Good evening,&quot; Juri said. The red-head turned around, and Juri 
noticed her obviously athletic grace. She looked strong willed and 
quite capable. The dark hared girl stood close by her, and it was 
obvious they were a couple. &quot;I hope you&#39;re having a good time?&quot; she 
asked them with a smile.

&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Sakura said shyly, wondering who this woman was.

&quot;Turn off the charm, Juri,&quot; Sonomi said to her with a smile, &quot;she&#39;s 
taken.&quot; She offered her hand, which Juri took wishing her, &quot;Merry 
Christmas.&quot;

&quot;All the good ones are,&quot; Juri said sadly. Tomoyo reflexedly took 
Sakura&#39;s hand, and a little smile teased at Juri&#39;s lips as she said, 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m harmless.&quot;

There was a soft snort of laughter from Minagi as she delivered the 
four drinks. Juri gave her a wounded look, and Kaho fought to hold 
back a laugh.

&quot;I think I&#39;m not going to get very much respect here tonight,&quot; Juri 
chuckled softly. &quot;I&#39;ll see you all later on tonight, maybe,&quot; she said 
with a wave over her shoulder as she went off to mingle with all the 
other guests.

Juri had to smile as she heard Sakura ask her friends, &quot;Can I be her 
when I grow up?&quot;
