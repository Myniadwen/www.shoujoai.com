<h2>Catalyst</h2>
<p>Kasumi had to douse Ranma with the kettle to get him to  stop staring blankly out the door after the vanished Zhu Shu. He blinked at  Kasumi as the taller girl handed him the tea tray. “Why don’t you take this and  share a cup of tea with Akane?” Kasumi smiled, faint color still in her cheeks.  “And I put an extra cup in case your friend comes back.”<p>
  Ranma nodded,  still too shocked to speak. He took the tray into the dining room and sat down  next to Akane, who was also staring out the door the way Zhu Shu had gone. “W-what  did she do in there?” Akane asked. “I-I heard part of your argument. Did she  say she thought I was cute?<p>
  Ranma nodded.  Akane looked at him wide-eyed, then looked down. “I-I heard what she made you  promise...”<p>
  Ranma looked  down and scratched his head. “Uh... Yeah.”<p>
  “Are... Do  you... do you really judge how I act against her?” Akane asked, looking down at  her feet.<p>
  Ranma scratched  the back of his head as he gave a sheepish grin. “Uh... I really hadn’t thought  about it like that, but I guess so. Zhu Shu’s, like, the most female girl I  know. I didn’t mean to.”<p>
  “Who <em>is</em> she, Ranma?” Akane looked up with  something pleading in her eyes.<p>
  Ranma shrugged. “I...  dunno. I would have said my best friend in the world a few minutes ago. Now...?”  he trailed off.<p>
  Now? Now maybe  she was someone he’d hurt really badly without meaning to. He felt miserable.  He wished he knew what that scene in the kitchen had been about. Was Zhu Shu <em>really</em> happy that he and Akane were  engaged? She <em>had</em> been trying to get  Ranma and Akane to stop fighting in the garden. And he had to admit that this  was the least angry he had seen Akane since that first day. But what of Zhu  Shu?<p>
  Did she <em>really</em> like girls? Or had she just tried  to pull a stunt to drive him away and hide her own heartbreak? Had she come  from China  because she thought they were more than friends? She’d said she’d taught him  because she wanted him to stay a girl. Had she meant it? <p>
  Akane was still  looking at him. He didn’t know what to say. Then, something caught his eye.<p>
  From the tree  next to the koi pond a single petal from a sakura blossom floated down to land  on the water. Then another followed it. And, like clockwork, a third. It took  him a second to tag what his subconscious was telling him.<p>
  It wasn’t a sakura  tree. That was way across the garden.<p>
  Suddenly, he  knew what he had to do. Zhu Shu was waiting for him to tell Akane about her, to  let Akane know about their friendship, and Akane was waiting for the same  thing. He nodded as he realized it was a point of honor. Akane deserved the  truth.<p>
  “Akane,” he said  quietly. “Zhu Shu is the girl who taught me all I know about <em>being</em> a female, little as that is.”  Ranma laughed ruefully. “I met her the day I was cursed. She came storming into  the Guide’s hut and wanted to know what kind of repayment Pops was going to  make to her for knocking her into a Jusenkyo pool. They went outside to talk  about it, and when they were done, Pops told me we were gonna escort her to the  next village as payment.” Ranma poured the tea for them both, surprised that  Akane was being so attentive and quite.<p>
  Sakura petals  were still falling.<p>
  Ranma continued.  “After lunch, we sparred some, and she made me feel like I was a friend, not a  rival. No one’s ever done that before... except you, that first day.” Akane  smiled behind her teacup at that. “I kinda thought she’d laugh at me when I was  helping her dry the dishes after dinner and Pops knocked over the bucket on me,  but she just made him mop it up and scolded him. Then that night, when I  started to bleed all over the place, she had not a single unkind word, and even  told Pops to go back to bed. She helped me clean up, and made a tea to help  with the cramps... but she wouldn’t allow me to change to boy again.” She  sighed. “Actually, she shamed me into staying female. I mean, if she could deal  with it, I could, right? She has to live with it all the time.”<p>
  Akane was still  drinking her tea and listening quietly. It was still so odd and un-Akane-ish.  She’d never acted like this before...<p>
  It never  occurred to him that he’d also never actually <em>talked</em> to Akane either, instead of insulting or belittling her.<p>
  Kasumi wandered  past the room with some laundry, saw the two of them, and smiled as she continued  down the hall.<p>
  “Anyway, she  lent me some female underwear and a pad, and her tea knocked me right out, and  the next thing I know, it’s dawn and I see Zhu Shu heading out the door to do  her morning kata. I thought I should go and maybe apologize to her for getting  mad at her about not letting me change, so I... uh... followed her...” Ranma  trailed off, blushing at the memory.<p>
  Akane caught the  blush. “What? Something more embarrassing than a boy having a period?!!” She  giggled. “Whatcha do, catch her naked?”<p>
  Ranma started  and blushed brighter. Akane laughed. “Oho! So I’m not the first girl you’ve  spied on!” She smiled even wider at Ranma’s confusion. “Well, I already knew  you were a letch. On with the story!”<p>
  Ranma blustered.  “Hey-“ but Akane put her finger on his lips.<p>
  “Hush! I’m only  teasing.” Further confusion was evident on Ranma’s face, so she continued, “I’m  not mad. Really. I was expecting it sooner or later, with <em>your</em> luck. Go on. I want to hear the rest.” <p>
  Ranma nodded,  still looking dubious. “Uh... yeah... well... I found Zhu Shu doing her kata by  the bathing pool out back, and... well... she was doing them nude... I-I kinda  sorta froze in shock...”<p>
  “Um hmm, I see.”  Akane poured them some fresh tea. “So. What did she look like?”<p>
  “What?” Ranma  asked shocked. “Y-you want to know what she looked like naked?” <p>
  “No, silly. What  did she look like doing her kata? I can imagine what she looks like naked!” She  giggled again at Ranma’s bewildered look.<p>
  “Uh... right!  Well... she moves like flowing water. I mean, even in slow motion she’s so  smooth that it’s like watching liquid. I’ve never seen anyone move like she  does, like every action is part of a dance. It’s so incredibly beautiful it’s  almost painful to watch. I don’t think I took a breath the entire time.” Ranma  shook himself out of the memory and hung his head. “And she made me so  incredibly jealous. Watching her, I would have sold my soul to have her grace,  her beauty...”<p>
  Akane knew <em>that</em> feeling well. It wasn’t easy having  Kasumi as an older sister... but she held her peace. Zhu Shu’s appearance had  seemed to spark something inside of Ranma that she’d never seen, and more than  anything, she didn’t want it hidden again. Not yet...<p>
  “Then I had to  breathe and I broke the spell.” Ranma sighed. “She turned and her eyes met  mine, and I saw something I’d never seen before...” Ranma sipped his tea as out  by the Koi pond, the steady fall of petals ceased. Outside the door, Kasumi  intercepted Nabiki before she could open it, then sent her father and Genma out  to get dinner. Inside the room, Ranma was staring off into space and saw none  of it.<p>
  Akane scooted  over to lean against Ranma. “So what was it you saw?”<p>
  “I... I don’t  know. I mean, I’ve fought all kinds of people, and I know a challenging look  well enough, but this was different. I mean, it was a challenging look, but it  wasn’t at the same time, ya know... It...” he trailed off, unable to find the  words. He stared fixedly at the tea tray, oblivious to the scene that had  unfolded before Akane.<p>
  The garden had  disappeared, and been replaced by a small clearing behind a primitive hut. In  that clearing stood a female Ranma, wearing only a tee shirt and underwear,  watching a nude Zhu Shu finish her forms and turn to look at him.<p>
  “Then she  laughed and asked me to come take a bath with her, and did a back flip into the  pool,” Ranma continued as Akane watched the scene playing outside, showing her  everything Ranma described about Zhu Shu’s lesson.<p>
  She really  couldn’t be angry, or even jealous. Zhu Shu had tried to do in an hour what  Akane’s mother had spent years doing before she died. She’d been direct, she’d  been blunt, and had done things that Akane would have died of embarrassment  trying, but she’d gotten her lessons across, and Ranma would never forget what  she’d taught her. She could no more be upset at Zhu Shu’s methods than she  would have been had her mother or Kasumi done the same thing. Ranma had <em>needed</em> to know what Zhu Shu had shown  him. <p>
  And as the scene  faded, she realized that that was exactly what Zhu Shu was trying to tell her.  She looked to the Chinese girl standing on a rock next to the Koi pond, a  strained and exhausted look on her face, and nodded that she understood. Zhu  Shu gave her a smile as bright as the sun, then blurred and disappeared as  Ranma continued.<p>
  “After that, we  were kinda best friends, ya know? We spent hours talking over the next five  days until we got to the next village, and... Well... I kinda got into a little  trouble and left in a hurry, so I didn’t get to say goodbye. I regretted that,  but Pop said it was where she was going anyway. I should have known better.”<p>
  “So. She was a  friend when you really needed one, huh?”<p>
  “Yeah... and  tonight, I would have done anything but made her mad. I mean, I’ve never even <em>seen</em> her upset before. She’s always been  so calm about everything. Even when she told Pop that if she wasn’t satisfied  with her payment, she would carve it out of him! And to have her go off on me  because of how I treat you?”<p>
  Akane gave him a  sidelong look, but decided to let it go this time. “Just what <em>did</em> she do in the kitchen?” <p>
  “Um... She  kissed Kasumi.”<p>
  “That’s all?  Here I thought it was something massive.”<p>
  “Umm... No. I  mean, she <em>kissed</em> Kasumi... Like in  the movies. Long romantic type kiss. A… umm… <em>deep</em> kiss.”<p>
  Just then,  Kasumi wandered past the door to the garden, whistling happily. “Oh, dinner  will be here soon. I asked Father to get takeout.” She wandered towards the  kitchen, still humming.<p>
  Akane  double-blinked after her. “Uh... And then?”<p>
  “She threatened  to steal you if I didn’t shape up.”<p>
  Akane turned  huge eyes towards Ranma. “And do you think she could?”<p>
  Ranma wouldn’t  meet her gaze. “Akane... If there is one thing I do believe about Zhu Shu, it’s  that if she is serious about liking girls, and she sets her sights on you...”  the way he trailed off told Akane all she needed to know. If it came down to  it, Ranma believed he’d already lost.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>After dinner, as  Ranma went to take a bath, Akane got Kasumi to make up an extra plate and took  it out to the tree next to the pond.<p>
  “Would you like  some sukiyaki?” she called up into the branches. Without a rustle, Zhu Shu  blurred into existence before her.<p>
  “Yes, thank you.  Zhu Shu very hungry. Revealing Mind’s Eye take much energy.”<p>
  Akane sat the  tray down on the bench and handed Zhu Shu one of the pillows she had brought,  sitting on the other herself. She took a deep breath.<p>
  “I-I wanted to  thank you.”<p>
  “Why for? Zhu  Shu only do what need done. Akane no need be jealous of Zhu Shu. Ranma make  very clear to her that he only her friend.” The Chinese girl looked Akane over.  “Zhu Shu want Akane and Ranma be happy. Make life easier.”<p>
  “Huh? I don’t  get you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked  at her critically. “Let Zhu Shu ask this. Does Akane love him?”<p>
  “That  egotistical, arrogant, self-righteous-“ She broke off as Zhu Shu’s finger  pressed her lips.<p>
  “Not ask  description. Ask if love.”<p>
  Akane looked  away. “I… don’t know.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Is  first problem.” She reached out and cupped Akane’s face in her hand and made  her look into her eyes. “Zhu Shu watch last few days. See how look when not  think Ranma see. See how much Akane hurt by thoughtless comment he make. Ranma  idiot in Way of Heart, but Zhu Shu not. Zhu Shu see that head must admit what  heart feel. Forget anger, forget insults, forget taunts. Remember kiss.  Remember feel of being snuggled to side, of laughter, of heart revealed.  Remember how felt when listen to talk. Of Ranma behind mask shows world. Ask  self if love.”<p>
  Akane couldn’t  meet her eyes any longer and turned away. Zhu Shu sighed and continued eating. “Zhu  Shu sees still much work needed.”<p>
  Silence reigned  for a long while before Akane spoke again. “W-w-were you serious?” she asked in  a small voice.<p>
  Zhu Shu debated  for a long while before nodding. “Zhu Shu on quest to find husband. Must find  husband to fulfill family duties.” She sat the empty plate back on the tray,  then knelt in front of Akane and placed her hand on Akane’s clasped ones. “Zhu  Shu <em>must</em> marry to have children. Is  last of Clan. Must bear heir. But, yes, Zhu Shu no like men.  She only like girl. Zhu Shu think maybe Ranma  could make happy, be both what Zhu Shu need <em>and</em> what she desire. Travel with to see. Ranma be good friend, but…” She shook her  head sadly. “Ranma not what Zhu Shu heart want, and he see only friend. When come  to Akane, Ranma can be fool, but Zhu Shu see truth. Akane can be jewel beyond  price, if can learn to control impulses. If Ranma too much fool to see to see  beyond surface…” She trailed off, caught between desire and family honor.<p>
  But the  wide-eyed look Akane gave her let her know she had understood the unspoken  feelings - and more, that she wasn’t repulsed by it. Zhu Shu had to look away  from her beautiful eyes. She sighed as she resumed her seat on the pillow.<p>
  If she wasn’t  constrained by family duty, she would indeed have meant the threat. But even  though she had made the threat solely for Ranma’s sake, he would be a fool not  to take it seriously. He might take what he considered his for granted, even  act as if he didn’t want it, but maybe the threat of its loss would show him  how much it really meant to him. He’d fight ever so much harder for Akane if he  thought he had some competition. Then, once he was firmly attached, it would be  time to bring Shan Pu in and introduce her to her future sister-wife…<p>
  Zhu Shu was  determined to see her friends happy, whatever it took. If Ranma wouldn’t be  happy without Akane, and Shan Pu wouldn’t be happy without Ranma, then that’s  how it had to be. Akane would eventually have to accept Shan Pu as her sister  in marriage to Ranma, whatever it took. Only time would tell if revealing her  secret shame had been worth it, if it had planted the seeds in Akane she had  hoped it would. It was so hard to read the Japanese girl through all the walls  she had built against heartache, but hopefully, the sign she thought she had  seen that Akane wouldn’t reject a female suitor instinctively was accurate. She  might call Ranma a hentai, and treat him like one, but she was too fervent in  her denials of everything, blushed too hard when Ranma inadvertently saw her in  her bra, and showed far too much outrage whenever Ranma casually showed off her  breasts following a dunking.  For all her  protestations, her aura showed all too clearly the arousal and interest she  fought so hard to deny. She didn’t understand her own feelings, and her  confusion instinctively translated into lashing out at the source of those  feelings, and the fact that both sides of Ranma’s curse generated the same  feelings just made her even more confused.   Akane had locked up her emotions long ago for some reason, and was  reluctant to let them out again, something Zhu Shu understood all too well.<p>
  She gave Akane a  sidelong look and sighed again mentally. Why couldn’t Ranma see what he had?  The beautiful tigress whose grace and elegance would come as she emerged from  her awkward adolescence and finally learned to be an adult. The woman she could  see within Akane’s aura made her feel breathless and she had to look away. <p>
  Zhu Shu gathered  up the tray while Akane sat and stared off into space, thinking. She shook her  head sadly as she headed for the dining room door, for what duty would never  allow. Perhaps Ranma wasn’t the only fool.<p>
  She bowed to  Kasumi as she entered the kitchen to return the tray. “Many thanks. Zhu Shu  honored would feed after actions. Must beg forgiveness for rudeness.”<p>
  Kasumi beamed  and bowed back. “You have no need to ask forgiveness. I did not take offense. I  agree with the intent of the action, and I am most pleased with the result,”  she said formally. She smiled wider, and said less formally, “Just give me  warning next time you kiss me so I can put down my mop!” She blushed and one  hand came up to her lips. “Oh my! I can’t believe I just said that!”<p>
  Zhu Shu wasn’t  listening. The relief she felt that Kasumi wasn’t angry with her combined with  the emotional stresses and the drain of holding her illusion so long caught up  with her, and she could no longer fight the wave of exhaustion...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kasumi caught  her as she fell and called for the others. Akane, Ranma, and Nabiki arrived to  find Kasumi cradling Zhu Shu’s head on her lap and stroking her hair.<p>
  “She’s all  right,” she told a worried Ranma. “She’s just exhausted all her ki. She just  needs sleep is all. Poor dear.” She got Ranma to pick the small girl up and  move her to the downstairs guest room before chasing everyone out so she could  tuck her in. Carefully undressing her, so as not to wake the Chinese girl,  Kasumi was surprised to note the ornate metallic gold and scarlet imperial  dragon tattoo that coiled down her back. She thought it was funny that Ranma  had not mentioned such a distinctive mark when he had described Zhu Shu to  Akane. She shrugged, if Zhu Shu wanted to tell her about it, she would. She  tucked the sheets around the exhausted girl and gathered up her few clothes to  wash.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Outside the  window, Mara watched as Kasumi closed the door to Zhu Shu’s room. “Dammit!” she  muttered. That hadn’t gone at all like she had planned! Zhu Shu was supposed to  cause trouble by telling Ranma about his other fiancée. What the hell was she  doing helping him out with this one? She rolled her eyes disgustedly. “Mortals!  You just can’t trust them!” She was about to fly off when Zhu Shu turned over  and the covers slipped off one shoulder to reveal the dragon, its eyes  seemingly watching her.<p>
  “Wha-“ Mara  stared. “I know she didn’t have that yesterday!” She considered for a long  moment, unnerved by the Dragon’s eyes upon her. “This is going to take some  research,” she said finally. With a last look at the dragon gleaming in the  moonlight, she turned and flew off.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ke Lun shook her  head sadly. “It is unfortunate, Shi. Had she been Amazon...”<p>
  Shi sighed. “She  isn’t, Ke Lun. She’s the last of the Clan. I know she’s not going to be happy  with anyone she finds, but she has no choice. Much as I disliked it, I allowed  my daughter to arrange a marriage to the only boy in the village with a pure  enough bloodline. I could have straightened Sung Li out in a year or two.”<p>
  Ke Lun shook her  head. “From what I learned of my adopted great-granddaughter, you may not have  had the time. There is a streak of despair in her that she hides well, but it  may break her before you can correct the boy.”<p>
  Shi looked away,  shadows in his eyes. “I know. I fear very much that it is my fault.”<p>
  Ke Lun raised an  eyebrow. “How so?”<p>
  Shi shook his  head. “I am not perfect, Ke Lun. I make mistakes. Zhu Shu’s aunt Wu had always  been jealous that her sister Fa had been born with the jade eyes, and would be  the heir instead of herself as eldest.  In  order to keep the two of them from constantly fighting, I sent Wu to live with  her fiancé’s parents for several years as she was growing up, not realizing  what hidebound idiots they were, or that they would imbed their prejudices so  deeply within her.  Following her  husbands death, she returned and lived with Fa and her husband until their  death, and seemed happy to be given the chance to raise Zhu Shu.  However, she dismissed the idea of Zhu Shu  being a true Daughter of the Dragon, and believed she should have only learned  the woman’s arts.  We were forever at  odds over my training Zhu Shu in the arts of the sword and ribbon, and in an  effort to keep peace, I foolishly allowed her to bully Zhu Shu about her  desires and drive the family of Fei from our village. Zhu Shu… has never been  the same since.” He sighed heavily then squared his shoulders. “Age does not  always wisdom grant. And duty must be done. What happened, happened. I must  ensure the Clan’s survival. Zhu Shu’s happiness comes second.”<p>
  Ke Lun shook her  head sadly. “You have grown colder than I remember, Shi. You were never so...  driven.”<p>
  “Perhaps if I  had been, my Clan would not have been nearly destroyed. I trusted the Musk,  trusted Clove. I couldn’t believe she would betray me so completely because I  chose Mu over her.  When the Musk came to  raze our fortress, I barely managed to get us out of the escape tunnel. I had  to kill Clove’s personal guard.”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “I  had wondered. Did you slay her?”<p>
  Shi looked at  her in surprise.  Then shook his head  slowly. “No.  She did not die by my  hands.” <p>
  Ke Lun sighed as  she shook her head, sensing that there was much Shi was not saying. “It would  have been better if you had.”<p>
  Shi nodded. “Would  that I had listened to you to begin with.”<p>
  Ke Lun shrugged.  “We cannot change the past, old friend. But maybe we can ensure a future.” <p>
  Shi was happy  enough to toast that. “Agreed.”<p>
  Ke Lun put her  tea cup down and stood to look out the pagoda window onto the village that  filled the cavern. “Still, Shi, I have to ask: if you were so determined to  keep Zhu Shu safe, why did you let her go on her quest?”<p>
  Shi stared down  into his cup for a long moment before answering. “I had no choice, Ke Lun. For  all my skill and power, I am still a man. I cannot go against the dictates of my  god. I let her go because the Dragon told me to.”<p>
  Ke Lun had no  answer for that.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Morning at the  Tendo Dojo. Ranma beating the tar out of his dad, who had a hangover. Nabiki  watching them from the dining room, figuring odds on who would go in the koi  pond first. Kasumi calling a sleepy-headed Akane down for breakfast as Ranma  did a head-dive into the pond. Soun Tendo greeting his family as if the fight  happening in the garden was beneath notice... until Ranma stepped out of the  pond and stripped his wet shirt off to wring it out, all the while yelling at  the panda and never noticing the stunned look on Soun’s face. Akane yelling at  Ranma about feminine modesty. Kasumi being the epitome of gracious calm. A  normal, typical morning.<p>
  Then Nabiki  asked how Zhu Shu was.<p>
  Genma froze, his  chopsticks halfway to his mouth.<p>
  Kasumi beamed. “Oh,  she was still sleeping when I checked. I didn’t want to wake the poor dear.”<p>
  Akane and Ranma  nodded at her, then looked at each other and blushed. They hurriedly began  shoveling food into their mouths.<p>
  Soun asked, “Who  is Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Genma tried not  to look panicked.<p>
  Kasumi turned  her smile on Soun. “Oh, she’s Ranma’s girlfriend from China.”<p>
  Ranma choked  while Genma began looking for a place to crawl into.<p>
  Soun blinked. “I  see.” He took out a cigarette, lit it and took a long puff...<p>
  The Soun demon  head fixed the pair with its bloodshot eyes. “WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?!!”<p>
  Surprisingly, it  was Akane who spoke up in the speechless pair’s defense.<p>
  “Daddy! It’s not  like that. She’s his best friend! And she’s my friend too!”<p>
  The head  blinked, then vanished. Soun looked at Akane questioningly.<p>
  “She’s his <em>friend</em>, and she came all the way from China to see  Ranma. She collapsed from exhaustion last night and Kasumi put her in the  downstairs guestroom,” Akane explained.<p>
  Soun gave the  Saotomes one last glare, then smiled. “Well, that’s alright then. It was  certainly the right thing to do. We can sort it all out later.” He went back to  his breakfast as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>As Akane and  Ranma walked to school, Akane got irritated at Ranma’s silence. “Well! Don’t  thank me or anything! It’s not like I was defending <em>you</em>! I just wanted to make sure Dad didn’t have the wrong idea  about Zhu Shu!”<p>
  Ranma walked  along the fence top and bit back his first retort. Zhu Shu would have known how  he felt without a word, but Akane was not Zhu Shu, and he had promised Zhu Shu  he would remember that. All he said was a quiet “Thank you.”<p>
  Prepared to  fight, Akane opened her mouth to yell, then stopped. “What did you say?”<p>
  Ranma looked  down. “I said thank you. You’re right. You defended me and I forgot to say  thank you.” He shook his head. “Sheesh! You try to apologize-“<p>
  “You’re welcome,”  Akane interrupted. She turned back towards school.<p>
  They walked in  silence for a while, then Ranma asked, “So. What’d you two talk about?”<p>
  Akane looked  sidelong. “Hmm?”<p>
  “You and Zhu  Shu. I saw you take a tray out before I hopped in the bath, and it was on the  floor next to Zhu Shu in the kitchen, so you had to have talked.”<p>
  Akane nodded.<p>
  “So what did you  talk about?”<p>
  “Why? Jealous?”<p>
  “Jealous? Why  would I be jealous?”<p>
  “Because your  fiancée went to talk to your oh-so-sexy lesbian best friend?”<p>
  Ranma refused to  look at her. Amused, Akane relented. “We talked about you.”<p>
  “Me?”<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  “What’d she say?”<p>
  “That you were a  fool.”<p>
  “Wha-?”<p>
  “I believe she  said that if you were such a fool as to not want me, then she would be happy to  steal me away from you.”<p>
  “I... see.” He  looked glum.<p>
  They walked in  silence for a while further.<p>
  “So, would you?”  he asked finally.<p>
  “Would I what?”<p>
  “Um... well...  you know...”<p>
  Akane arched an  eyebrow. “Date her? Over you?”<p>
  Ranma nodded,  fear in his eyes.<p>
  Akane saw it.  She could crush him utterly. His fragile ego could never put up with it. Anger,  hatred, even despair would never bow him as much as losing even his token  fiancée to the <em>girl</em> he considered the  epitome of femininity. It was the victory she’d dreamed of since he’d insulted  her breast size...<p>
  But Zhu Shu’s  words echoed in her ears. “Ask self if love...”<p>
  A lie that might  not be a lie, or a chance, however slim, that she might actually get through to  him?<p>
  Did she love  him?<p>
  Zhu Shu said her  heart already knew.<p>
  The wind  whistled through the fence Ranma walked upon, the dread in his eyes growing. <p>
  Did she love  him?<p>
  She couldn’t  answer that, but neither could she bring herself to hurt him that way. He might  be a baka and a hentai, but he was as much a victim of this crazy fiancé thing  as she was. But she wasn’t going to let him off the hook entirely. She gave him  an appraising look and said “Hmm, why don’t you actually try asking me out on a  date and we’ll see?”<p>
  Hope rose in his  eyes, burning away the dread. “Uh... Yeah. I’ll see what I can do.”<p>
  He whistled  happily as they finished walking to school, with Akane giving him sidelong  looks occasionally.<p>
  Maybe the big  lunk did care for her after all.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu woke  when Kasumi brought in the breakfast tray, and sat up in alarm. It took her a  second to realize where she must be and a further second to realize she was  nude. She scrabbled for the sheet and held it over her breasts as Kasumi laid  out the tray.<p>
  “Good morning! I  brought you breakfast since you slept right through everyone else’s,” Kasumi  beamed<p>
  Zhu Shu bowed in  the bed. “Thank you. Zhu Shu very hungry.” Her stomach growled in agreement. “Not  mean pass out. Hope was not much trouble?”<p>
  “Oh my. Not at  all.” Kasumi smiled again. “Ranma carried you here and I got you ready for bed.  I’m afraid I didn’t have any nightclothes that would fit you, but your dress is  on the little table there, along with some panties. We’re the same size there,  and I had extras.”<p>
  “Thank you.” She  leaned forward to take the teacup and heard Kasumi gasp. She froze, looking to  see what Kasumi had been startled by.<p>
  Kasumi was  looking at her back in astonishment.<p>
  “That’s very  strange. I could have sworn I saw a tattoo there last night.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.  As she picked up the tea, she willed the tattoo to reappear. <p>
  Across her back,  the dragon faded back in. She looked at Kasumi. “Is not safe always be Clan  Dragon. Has caused Zhu Shu trouble. Communists not like reminders of old  empire. Others think mean belong to Tong. Tattoo will hide self if Zhu Shu  wish.”<p>
  Kasumi looked  stricken. “Oh my, you poor dear. I’m sorry to hear that. It’s just so lovely!”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded  and swept her hair to one side as she stood to let Kasumi see all of it. “Imperial  dragon. Guardian spirit. Marked when Zhu Shu thirteen. Song family Imperial  servants. Zhu Shu train all life serve Emperor. Now Zhu Shu of age to marry.  Must find husband worthy of Imperial service, of her. Must bear Heir for Song  family,” she noted sadly. “Even though Emperor is no more. Family honor must be  maintained.”<p>
  “Oh my.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sat back  on the bed. “Zhu Shu been on quest for year. Not find husband who pass tests.”<p>
  “What tests?”  Kasumi asked.<p>
  “One. Beat Zhu  Shu in fair combat.”<p>
  “From the  respect Ranma gives you, I would assume you to be quite skilled. That would  make passing that test rather difficult.”<p>
  “Two. Must prove  love of Zhu Shu. Not just lust.”<p>
  Kasumi nodded. “That  would be the really hard one. So few people look beyond appearances.”<p>
  Zhu Shu  shrugged. “Many people want Zhu Shu body. None want Zhu Shu.”<p>
  Kasumi patted  her shoulder. “They can be so blind, no?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Why  Zhu Shu put quest on hold. Help Ranma.”<p>
  Kasumi looked  wide-eyed. “Oh my. You put your quest on hold for him?”<p>
  “Yes. Ranma like  Zhu Shu. Need friend. Ranma need someone be honest with, who not laugh, and Zhu  Shu...”<p>
  “Zhu Shu hoped  to find what she needed to fulfill family duty and her own desires at the same  time.” Kasumi finished.<p>
  “Yes,” Zhu Shu  admitted.<p>
  “But you’d give  him up for Akane?”<p>
  “No. Ranma is  friend. Will always be friend. Zhu Shu fool to think otherwise once. Ranma is  not Zhu Shu type.” A whole world of understanding passed unspoken between the  girls with that statement. Ranma was a male first, and always would be. The  understanding in Kasumi’s eyes made it easier. “Zhu Shu help because is friend.  Ranma like Akane, even if not admit to self. She same way. Zhu Shu be poor  friend if not help friends find happiness, yes no?”<p>
  Kasumi hugged  her. “Not many friends would think that way. For what it’s worth, while we’d  never work out for anything else, I’d be honored to be your friend too.”<p>
  Zhu Shu laughed.  “Zhu Shu is honored. And know Kasumi not Zhu Shu type. She not warrior.  Is most honorable Keeper of Hearth.”<p>
  Kasumi  smiled.  “Yes, I suppose I am a very  motherly type.  But that doesn’t mean I  am totally defenseless.  I can swing a  broom with the best of them!” she said with a wry grin.<p>
  The air cleared  between them, the girls laughed as only true friends can...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>After the two  girls chatted through breakfast, Zhu Shu helped Kasumi clean up while telling  her of her adventures so far, but omitting things that Kasumi didn’t need to  know yet. All she told her was that she had traveled to Japan with a  friend and was staying temporarily at a Shinto shrine, following which Kasumi  insisted she come stay at the dojo. She introduced Zhu Shu to her father, Soun,  and made arrangements for Zhu Shu to have the dojo for her training classes  with her quintet of “friends”. Zhu Shu thanked him and so charmed Soun that he  told her to think of him as her father while she was there.  Genma even volunteered to move himself and  Ranma into the downstairs guestroom to leave the upper floor to the girls,  though Zhu Shu suspected that it might have more to do with getting out of  having to climb stairs every day than anything else.  <p>
  Afterwards, she  went with Kasumi to Hikawa Shrine to get her possessions, and Zhu Shu  introduced Kasumi to Rei. Kasumi’s smile won another heart and soon she and Rei  were chatting like old friends. She helped pack up Zhu Shu’s few clothes and  promised to tell the other girls about the dojo, and arrange to get all of Zhu  Shu’s stuffed animals sent over. She was happy Zhu Shu had found her friend and  had a place to live, but Zhu Shu could see the slight wistfulness in her look  too. She kissed Rei on the cheek as she was leaving and told her that maybe she’d  let her spy on her kata again sometime. Rei blushed from her hairline down to  her top as Zhu Shu gave her a hug and made her promise to show up for lessons  on time.<p>
  “I think she  likes you,” Kasumi said to Zhu Shu as they were getting back on the subway.<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Zhu  Shu knows. Rei young and still try to find own way. Zhu Shu may be good  influence as teacher, but not wish hurt Rei. Zhu Shu may tease, but would not  take advantage of confused feelings of girl. Zhu Shu could use what taught to  make Rei think she love Zhu Shu, but would be wrong. Rei is only curious as to  what might be like with girl, but Rei must be allowed choose own path.  No matter how cute Zhu Shu think Rei is, Zhu  Shu will not chase.”<p>
  Kasumi looked at  her with a measuring gaze. “You amaze me, dear. It’s so easy to forget you’re  younger than I am. You remind me of my mother.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged  as she looked down at her feet. “Zhu Shu have been trained very long time. Must  understand people to serve. Most important, must know <em>why</em> people do what do. Cannot advise if not know what behind  actions.”<p>
  Kasumi pursed  her lips. “I see.” She looked at Zhu Shu for several minutes as the train  clattered through a tunnel, then reached out to pat Zhu Shu’s hand. “I imagine  you must be as lonely as I.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked  up in surprise.<p>
  Kasumi smiled  sadly. “I know how it feels, dear. I’ve had to be the mother to my whole family  since Mother died. Even Father hasn’t been the same. Mother’s death hit all of  us so hard. Poor Nabiki does everything she can to keep the Dojo solvent, and  hides her feelings behind a wall of indifference. Akane feels like she has to  carry the honor of the school on her shoulders and has tried to run away from  her hurt by making everything into a trial by combat. They all have so many  concerns that I just try to keep our home a pleasant place so we all have our  own safe haven. I know it makes many people think I’m just a simpleton, but it’s  all I know to do. It’s the only way I can give Akane and Nabiki the freedom to  be even as much normal teenagers as they are.” She sighed. “But it’s lonely. I  never get to go out except for shopping and occasionally to see Doctor Tofu,  but I fluster him so much he’s impossible to talk to, and I have to pretend not  to notice because he’d have a heart attack or stroke if I didn’t. He nearly  killed poor Ranma the other day when I visited.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.  She remembered Kasumi entering, but had left when Akane had. But she did  remember Ranma’s tilted head later.<p>
  Kasumi looked  out the window. “Hell, if I was any less afraid that it would almost certainly  be fatal for one of us, I’d seduce him.” She rolled her eyes. “But either he’d  accidentally break me, or he’d have an embolism. So I’m stuck with fantasies...”  She sighed again. “Maybe when Akane and Ranma are married and Nabiki has her  own place; when I don’t have to be the mother…” She shrugged resignedly.<p>
  Zhu Shu hugged  her. “Is hard, yes no?”<p>
  “Very”<p>
  “Maybe Zhu Shu  help. Zhu Shu good with house, and must practice for family.” She smiled at  Kasumi. “And Zhu Shu good at shiatsu.”<p>
  Kasumi caught  the twinkle in her eyes and laughed. “I may take you up on that, my little  mouse!”<p>
  “Ah. Is what Zhu  Shu mean. Little Mouse. Grandfather say Zhu Shu always have look like mouse who  stole cheese from trap!” Zhu Shu twitched her nose.<p>
  “He’s right.”  Kasumi smiled, the sadness gone from the back of her eyes. “I guess I’ll have  to hide all the cheese!”<p>
  “Where?” Zhu Shu  made a show of looking everywhere. Kasumi took one look at the girl bouncing  around the car looking for cheese and couldn’t help but laugh...</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ke Lun looked  back down the road to the cavern. Shi had given her much to think about. She  sighed softly as she turned and followed the trail down to the valley. He was  so different than she remembered, like he’d lost something and never found it  again. There were things he wasn’t telling her.<p>
  And so much he  had never told Zhu Shu.<p>
  It was obvious  he had grown somewhat paranoid in the centuries since the fall of Clan Dragon,  but much of the man she had once loved was still there.<p>
  It was a pity  really that he’d met and fallen for Mu. She had flirted with the idea of  marrying him for too long, unsure of her heart and too involved in trying to  undermine Clove’s efforts to win him, and had lost him to a newcomer he had met  during one of his numerous diplomatic visits to Peking. It wasn’t that Mu was a  bad wife for him - she wasn’t - she just wasn’t a warrior. She’d been the  epitome of traditional Chinese femininity, and a true beauty as well, as close  in appearance to a Daughter of the Dragon as Ke Lun had ever seen outside of  Clan Dragon’s bloodline. Ke Lun had never been jealous of her or envious of her  because she had been such a sweet and wonderful person, but it was obvious that  her loss had wounded Shi greatly. <p>
  The fact that  Zhu Shu’s appearance and personality was so much like Mu’s probably helped  explain why Shi loved her so much in the face of his self-imposed mission. <p>
  She sighed yet  again. So much would be different if she’d just killed Clove when she had the  chance. She’d known the Musk Princess was going to be trouble from the moment  she’d seen her. Spoiled, vain, and selfish to the core, the girl had taken all  of the worst qualities of her dragon mother and perfected them. Clove had taken  one look at Shi and decided that he was going to be her trophy. If only she  could have proven that Clove had been behind the attempt to poison Mu…<p>
  She’d been over  and over that for three hundred years. No point in doing it again. Shi had survived,  and Zhu Shu was her adopted great-granddaughter. The past was the past. She’d  learned that after her husband hunt for that good-for-nothing…<p>
  She sighed  again. Too many memories. Meeting Shi again had dredged up things she had  thought safely buried.<p>
  It was good Zhu  Shu had blood-bonded to Shan Pu. It would give her the chance to find someone  she could actually be happy with, maybe even Saotome. She certainly had no  reservations about Zhu Shu’s preferences, even if she agreed with Shi she had  to bear an heir. With the blood-bond added to a marriage, Shan Pu’s children  would also be Clan Dragon, and with a pureblood heir, the survival of the Clan  would be assured. Shan Pu certainly wouldn’t object, her great grand-daughter  had expressed her interest in Zhu Shu clearly enough the night Zhu Shu had  arrived, and Ke Lun had let her know she approved.  She had been certain Zhu Shu felt an  attraction to Shan Pu, and it had surprised her that Zhu Shu had sidestepped  Shan Pu’s offer. Among Amazons, an offer to take a sister-wife was the  equivalent of a marriage offer, and it was just as binding by Amazon law. Had  Zhu Shu accepted, Shi would have had no choice but to allow the marriage to  stand, as Clan Dragon had always honored the Amazon’s customs. While Zhu Shu  would have had to accept Saotome’s attentions occasionally, Shan Pu would be  happy to make up for it the rest of the time. <p>
  She smiled as  she headed home. She’d wait till Zhu Shu and Shan Pu sent another letter, and  depending on what it said, maybe she’d follow them to Japan, which was were  they said they were going in their last letter. If she convinced Zhu Shu to  accept Shan’s offer, it could solve several problems at once.<p>
  Still, she  wished she could have found out what Shi had seemed so afraid of that he had  hidden the Clan away for so long. He had known that the Amazons had avenged  Clan Dragon, but he seemed certain that the Musk had had something else driving  them beyond just Clove. She would have given anything to know what Clove had  told him during their last encounter. What was the shadowy fear Shi hid from?  Why had he allowed Zhu Shu out on her quest without her knowing of whatever  danger lurked beyond the haven of her home village? And did that shadowy fear  even still exist?<p>
  Too many  questions with no answers. Still, if whatever Shi feared still survived, wouldn’t  Zhu Shu have encountered it already in her travels across China? <p>
  Well,  speculation wasn’t getting anywhere, and Shi hadn’t been forthcoming. Perhaps  she should have told him of Zhu Shu’s curse.<p>
  She shook her  head. No. It would have only haunted him further. Far be it from her to lay any  more ghosts at Shi’s doorstep. The gods knew he had enough…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kasumi and Zhu  Shu swung through the Chinatown on their way  back. Zhu Shu hurried to the herbalist’s shop in hopes of avoiding a repeat of  the other day, but the herbalist handed her a note with the package. Puzzled  she looked at the slip of Mandarin.<p>
  “They are  watching” was all it said.<p>
  Worried, Zhu Shu  directed Kasumi to stay behind her and to hold the packages. Kasumi looked at  Zhu Shu’s eyes and nodded.<p>
  Outside the  shop, the street was empty. Zhu Shu looked around. With Kasumi along, her  options were limited; it was the street or nothing. She couldn’t carry Kasumi  to the rooftops.<p>
  Her swords  appeared from behind her back, green fire flickering along the blades as she  advanced up the street. <p>
  Her only warning  was a whistle of wind as the shuriken sliced air. She shifted to combat time  and the world slowed to a crawl. She batted the star away, part of her mind  analyzing the path even as she deflected another. Anger flared as she realized  they had been aimed to wound. Whoever it was, they wanted her alive.<p>
  Another star  flew past as three black-clad figures appeared out of the shadows. Her eyes  widened in momentary shock, then narrowed as she dodged another round of stars. <p>
  She blocked  three more, hampered by the need to ensure that none of the deflected stars  went near Kasumi. Then she heard the slow sound of a gunshot. Desperately, she  intercepted the bullet with both swords, rolling with the impact as she  realized it had not been aimed at her.<p>
  Training was all  that controlled the rage, channeled it into her chi. The slow crawl of time  came to a near halt. Still in mid-air, she screamed “Talon Sweep!” and launched  herself at the gunman. Her sword’s burning green blade swept through the gun,  then the man holding it. As the pieces slowly began to part, Zhu Shu was  already at the next assailant. She didn’t even slow as her sword sliced through  his middle, her spin carrying her second sword through the neck of the third  and last thug.<p>
  Coming to the  form’s completion behind the falling body as time slammed back to its normal  pace, Zhu Shu took a deep breath. She felt faint, too little of her chi having  returned from being drained yesterday. She turned to meet Kasumi’s worried  look. <p>
  “Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Zhu Shu tried to  take a step forward, tried to summon the speed to reach the thug who’d appeared  behind Kasumi, but her legs wouldn’t work. Even as she was falling, she heard  Kasumi’s startled yelp.<p>
  Cursing her  weakness, she struggled to stand as she heard a loud <em>thunk</em>, like something striking bone. As she lifted her head to look  over the bodies before her, she damned herself for what she expected to see.  She had failed her friend, a crime that to her was as grievous as failing her  Emperor...<p>
  But it wasn’t  Kasumi’s body lying on the ground.<p>
  Kasumi put the  rolling pin back into her purse. “I swear. People these days!”<p>
  Zhu Shu couldn’t  help but laugh.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Kasumi helped  Zhu Shu back to the subway and they quickly left the Chinatown  behind. Zhu Shu caught her breath and looked apologetically at Kasumi. “Zhu Shu  sorry endanger life and fail slay last assassin.”<p>
  Kasumi looked at  her sternly. “I won’t hear it! You did nothing of the sort! If anything, it was  the other way around. I put you in danger because you had to protect me! You  took care of the really dangerous ones! All I did was club one guy with a  knife. I <em>am</em> a <em>Tendo</em>. The day I can’t handle one maniac with a knife… why… why… I’ll  take up chainsaw juggling!” Her sudden fury ended and she looked at Zhu Shu  with a strange gleam in her eye. “And don’t think I didn’t see you stop that  bullet! I owe you my life! And for that, all I have to give you as a reward is  this.”<p>
  The entire car  grew silent as every last eye turned to see Kasumi cupping Zhu Shu’s face,  retrieving her stolen kiss with interest.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Passengers  waiting in the Nerima subway were treated to an unusual show that morning as  trains unloaded. From one car, no one exited for several seconds as Kasumi  regally walked forward to the door. Every eye was upon her as she walked and  stunned passengers cleared a path for her. At the door, an elderly gentleman  bowed her through and offered her a hand to the platform. She stepped lightly,  then turned and offered her hand to a bemused and slightly dazed Zhu Shu. She  gave a small nod of her head to the rest of the train, then, like a Queen  proceeding to take her throne, she turned and led the Mandarin girl towards the  stairs. <p>
  Behind her, the  entire coach broke out in applause.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Nabiki was  finishing her lunchtime business when one of her factors came running up waving  a photo. “Miss Nabiki! I just got this from an agent on the subways! It was  taken less than two hours ago! I got him to hold onto the negatives until you  told us what to do!”<p>
  “What <em>are</em> you going on about?” Nabiki asked,  bored. It had been an excruciatingly dull day. Ranma and Akane hadn’t fought  all day and Gosunkugi hadn’t turned in his next batch of Akane pics for selling  to Kuno. She gave her factor a sour look and reached out to snag the photo.<p>
  One look, and  all the boredom went out of her day, replaced by panic. She grabbed the factor  by the shirt. “Did anyone else get pictures of this!!!” she screamed.<p>
  “I-I-I d-d-don’t  k-k-k-now!” the factor stuttered as Nabiki shook him.<p>
  “Find out!!! I  want every last copy accounted for and the negatives in my hand by day’s end!!!  Find out everyone who was on that train! Steal the film if you have to!” She  let the pale factor go and looked at the picture again. She felt the strength  give out in her knees and she sank limply to the ground. The picture fell from  her hand to land in her skirt as she shook her head slowly.<p>
  “Akane I half  expect… Me, I’d just have a few copies made and keep the negatives…” Her eyes  turned down to the impossible photo. “But I never, ever, would have suspected  Kasumi…”</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Three people had  taken photos. It took all her CD money and selling her entire stock of Akane  pics to Kuno to get the money, but by day’s end, Nabiki had the negatives of  Kasumi’s kiss. She locked them away in her book bag and turned to get her  second shock of the day.<p>
  Ranma was  waiting for her. <p>
  “Hey, Nabiki… I…  umm… that is…”<p>
  “Spill it, Ranma.”<p>
  “Um… Would you  know where I could take Akane out on a date so she’ll have a good time?”<p>
  Two fundamental  shocks to her system in one day was one too many. Faced once more with the  impossible, her brain took the easy out.<p>
  She fainted.</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>“What did you do  to her, you jerk?!”<p>
  “Hey! I didn’t  do nuthin! I just asked her a question and she fainted!”<p>
  Akane’s eyes  narrowed. “What did you ask her?”<p>
  “Umm… It’s kinda  personal.” Ranma blushed.<p>
  “I’ll bet!”  Akane huffed. “Well, don’t just stand there like an idiot! Pick her up! We have  to take her to see Doctor Tofu.”<p>
  Ranma sighed and  bent to pick Nabiki up. As he did, a picture started to fall out of Nabiki’s  shirt pocket, but Akane caught it and poked it back in.<p>
  “Be careful! She’ll  bitch to high heaven if anything gets lost.”<p>
  Ranma sighed and  kept reminding himself that Akane was not Zhu Shu over and over.<p>
  All the way to  the doctor’s.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kasumi was  waiting outside the Doctor’s office, a slight flush on her face. “Oh my! What  happened to Nabiki?”<p>
  Akane double  blinked. “Kasumi? What are you doing here?”<p>
  Kasumi blushed. “Oh  my… um… I’m afraid I caused Zhu Shu to pull a muscle, so I brought her to the  Doctor to be checked out. I thought that after last night and, um… well, I  wanted to make sure she was okay. But what’s wrong with Nabiki?”<p>
  “Dunno,” Ranma  supplied. “She just fainted.”<p>
  “Why are you out  here instead of inside?” Akane asked.<p>
  “I thought it  might be safer. Doctor Tofu gets so distracted when I’m around.” Kasumi gave  her a glowing smile.<p>
  Akane did  another double blink. “Uh… Yeah. I’ve noticed.”<p>
  “Well you two  get Nabiki in there and make sure she’s okay!” Kasumi beamed.<p>
  As they walked  into the clinic, Ranma’s head turned to watch Kasumi. “Is it my imagination, or  is she glowing more than usual?”<p>
  Akane turned and  looked back at her sister. “Now that you mention it…”<p>
  In the  examination room, Dr Tofu was feeding an exhausted looking Zhu Shu an herbal  tea.<p>
  “You drink that  first to help your ki, and in a few minutes I’ll work on those muscle strains.”  Zhu Shu nodded as Tofu turned to Akane.<p>
  “Why hello,  Akane, Ranma. What’s happened to Nabiki?”<p>
  “Dunno, Doc. She  fainted,” Ranma said.<p>
  Tofu turned  towards another bed. “Well, bring her over here and we’ll see what’s up!” As  Ranma turned towards the other bed, the photo fell from Nabiki’s pocket and  fluttered to the floor under Zhu Shu’s bed.<p>
  Ranma put Nabiki  on the bed as Doctor Tofu said, “Zhu Shu tells me she’s a friend of yours,  Ranma.”<p>
  “Yeah, we met in  China.”<p>
  “She’s a very  nice girl. You haven’t been fighting with her, have you, Akane?”<p>
  Akane started. “Huh?  Me? No sir. She’s my friend too.”<p>
  “Ah. Well, I  could have sworn some of those pulled muscles were your trademark! Ah, well,  nothing’s wrong with Nabiki at least. Probably just mental stress!” He did something  with the sides of her head, and Nabiki’s eyes flew open. “There you are! You  just take it easy now, Nabiki! I’ve got to check on Zhu Shu.”<p>
  Nabiki sat up in  horror, one hand slapping her pocket. “Oh no!”<p>
  “What?” Akane  asked, then saw what Nabiki was reaching for. “Ranma! I told you to keep an eye  on that photo!”<p>
  “Hey! It’s not  my- ulp!” Nabiki had him by the arm in a death grip, her eyes locked on the  floor by Zhu Shu’s bed.<p>
  Ranma looked and  saw the photo. “See! There it is.”<p>
  “Ranma!” Nabiki  hissed. “If Tofu sees that picture, he’ll kill her!”<p>
  “Huh? Who?”<p>
  “Zhu Shu! Ranma,  if you value Zhu Shu’s life, <em>you can’t  let Doctor Tofu see that picture!</em>”</p>
