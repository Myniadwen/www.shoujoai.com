<h2>Reflections and  Cherry Blossoms </h2>
<p>Evening found Zhu Shu setting in the garden at the back  of the house under Akane’s window, meditating.<p>
  She had begged off teaching the Senshi today, allowing  Akane to run the girls through basic exercises and having Ranma spar with  Makoto. With Zhu Shu watching, he hadn’t showed off too much, and he’d actually  proven to be adept at teaching. The girls had been upset that Zhu Shu was too  drained to teach, and had been all for going and teaching Ai and crew a lesson,  but had desisted when Zhu Shu had assured them she could handle Ai. Still, it  had given her a chance to watch everyone more closely than she could when teaching.  After the session, she assigned a series of stretching exercises for the Senshi  to do every morning, before going to help Kasumi make dinner.<p>
  The rest of the day had proven uneventful - an unusual  situation around the Tendo house since the Saotome’s arrival - but everyone had  enjoyed the peace. Nabiki was even in a very good mood for some reason. Zhu Shu  had started to help with the dishes, only to have Kasumi shoo her out to the  garden to rest.<p>
  As Zhu Shu meditated, she concentrated on the currents  of chi through the garden, her eyes closed as she tried to feel at one with the  energy flows. She had stayed in her cursed form, feeling a need to try and  understand it better. Her dragon-girl form seemed to make her abilities with  chi much stronger, and that worried her.<p>
  The problem with her dragon-girl form was it seemed to  gradually be becoming more and more comfortable, and she was starting to lose  her mental image of herself as she was normally. More and more often, she was  having dreams where this was her normal form, and her normal form was the  curse. It was disturbing, because for all its advantages, she was beginning to  notice she seemed to have less control over this form’s emotions. Strong  emotions came too easily when she was her dragon half. The iron wall she had  spent years building was becoming harder and harder to maintain, and it scared  her a little. The way she had lost her temper immediately upon changing today  had been an indication of her loss of control. She had had to fight herself there  at the end, not only to catch her breath, but to keep herself from assaulting  Ai and dragging her off. She had been able to smell Ai’s arousal…<p>
  Hopefully, if she worked on her exercises while in  this form, it would become easier to control. It hadn’t been a difficult fight  to reign herself in, but she would feel better when she’d learned how to  compensate for this form’s stronger impulses.<p>
  An eddy in the flows warned her of Ranma’s arrival as  he jumped down from the roof and came to sit in front of her. She smiled to  herself mentally. <em>Right on time</em>.<p>
  “You never did tell me why you were angry with me  earlier,” he said by way of greeting. Zhu Shu opened one eye to look at him for  a moment before closing it and sighing.<p>
  “Zhu Shu say. Ranma not listen.”<p>
  “Well... would you please tell me again? I hate it  when you’re mad at me. I mean, I’ve come to expect nothing else from Akane,  usually, but you’ve never been mad at me before. Not like this.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sat for a long moment before replying. “Why  Ranma feel boy better than girl?”<p>
  “Well... umm... Guys are stronger. We’re better at  martial arts... stuff like that.”<p>
  “So all life Ranma think girls inferior?”<p>
  “It’s not like that. Girls are great at some stuff.  Sewing, keeping house, cooking; stuff like that.”<p>
  “Ranma sew. Ranma cook. Even see Ranma help some clean  house.”<p>
  “Yeah, but girls are better at that sort of stuff. I  only learned how to do any of that cause I had to.”<p>
  “Ah. So think girls learn for fun?”<p>
  “Uh...” Ranma scratched the back of his head as he  gave Zhu Shu a sheepish grin. “No, I guess not.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu learn because have no choice.”<p>
  “But you seem to enjoy it.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu does. Is feeling of satisfaction doing task  have to be done, if done well. Zhu Shu learn take pride in doing job well. Not  mean she want only do. Zhu Shu much happier learning martial art. Have more fun  do sword forms than ever do cleaning.”<p>
  “Oh.” Ranma sat and thought about that for a long  moment. “So... I guess you were upset because I said I wanted to protect you?”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Ranma, would have been worried if Zhu  Shu and Ai boy?”<p>
  “Heck no. I wouldn’t interfere in a personal challenge  between a couple a guys.”<p>
  “But not give Zhu Shu same respect would give boy?”<p>
  Ranma stiffened. “I respect you! You know I do!”<p>
  “No, Ranma do not. Ranma give Zhu Shu less respect  then he give Kuno. Give Akane even less.”<p>
  “How can you say that?”<p>
  “Because is true. Zhu Shu is warrior first. Ranma  respect skill. Ranma respect friendship. Ranma respect insight, but Ranma no  respect Zhu Shu warrior heart. Ranma not treat Zhu Shu as equal, as warrior,  but as servant. When say protect from Ai, say Ranma have no confidence in Zhu  Shu as warrior.”<p>
  Ranma sat and stared at the ground. “I do respect you,  Zhu Shu. I mean we sparred for that whole week and you helped me build up my  speed. But you’re not as strong as me. And no matter how fast you are, you’re  helpless without your swords and ribbons. I just don’t want to see you get  hurt. I hate seeing someone get picked on by someone stronger. If you had  gotten into real trouble with Ai, I-“<p>
  “Would allow personal challenge go without interfere.  Zhu Shu challenged, Zhu Shu accept. If Zhu Shu lose, show Zhu Shu need train  more,” Zhu Shu said firmly.<p>
  Ranma sulked. “Aw... Zhu Shu, you can’t expect me to  stand by and allow those idiot cheerleaders to beat you up!”<p>
  “Zhu Shu can and do. If Ai challenge again, Zhu Shu  answer. If lose, Ranma will not interfere. Is Zhu Shu place defend family  honor. Do not try to take away.”<p>
  Ranma sullenly glared into the pond. “It means that  much to you?”<p>
  “Does Ranma honor mean much to Ranma?”<p>
  He sighed. “Alright. I’m sorry I insulted you. I just-“<p>
  “Worry about friend. Zhu Shu understand, but Ranma  must allow Zhu Shu be warrior.”<p>
  “Alright, but if it looks like someone’s trying to  kill you or something, don’t expect me to just let them.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu would not.”<p>
  Ranma nodded. For a long time, they sat there by the  pond before Ranma spoke again. “I had something else I wanted to ask you.”<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  “How do you know if you like someone?”<p>
  Zhu Shu opened her eyes and tilted her head at him. A  slight smile played across her lips. “Zhu Shu not know how to explain.”<p>
  She reached out and scooped up a single cherry blossom  from the dozens scattered under the trees, holding the delicate bloom cupped in  her hand as her eyes lost focus. “When Zhu Shu young, she have best friend. Her  name Ying-Ying...” She held up the cherry blossom, her eyebrow raised  questioningly.<p>
  “That’s a sakura blossom. A Japanese cherry.” Ranma  said.<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Is what Ying-Ying mean. Cherry  Blossom.” She blew the flower out of her hand and watched as it spiraled down  to join it’s bretheren. “Ying-Ying and Zhu Shu do everything together. We do  chores, listen storyteller, and explore cliffs above village. When Zhu Shu not  train, she play with Ying-Ying.”<p>
  “When Zhu Shu turn twelve, she begin mature as woman.  Begin have feelings she never have before. Ying-Ying best friend, and Zhu Shu  tell her how feel, and Ying-Ying listen. We spend months talking. Discussing  feelings.”<p>
  “When thirteen, Zhu Shu realize not want live life  without Ying-Ying. Realize love. Tell Ying-Ying, and find Ying-Ying feel same,  too scared to say to Zhu Shu.  We both  share selves with each other, explore how far feelings go, and find that we  touch souls.  We exchange chi, bond  ourselves forever.”  Her eyes closed,  silent tears trickling down her cheeks.   “We think we always be together.”<p>
  Ranma started to reach out a hand but stopped when Zhu  Shu shook her head and wiped away the tears, her eyes opening as she closed off  the heartache again.<p>
  “But was not to be.   We both still considered children. Aunt find out. She punish Zhu Shu  badly. Might have killed if Grandfather not interfere. Ying-Ying family move  away. Zhu Shu feel like she dead, like heart ripped out of body even though she  still moving. She do what aunt say, learn what aunt teach. Think never feel anything  again.”<p>
  A sound of a door opening reached her ears from the  open window over head. Ranma didn’t seem to notice as he said “Man, that really  sucks. Why’d your aunt do that?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged. “Zhu Shu have duty to give heir for  Clan Dragon. Cannot make babies with girl.” She sighed softly. She heard a  slight creak as the chair by the window was occupied.  She did her best to forget those final  memories as she looked back over the happier days and how her beloved flower  had made her feel.<p>
  “When Zhu Shu with Ying-Ying, feel like was center of  world, like she make Zhu Shu fly. Knew liked her when she in all Zhu Shu’s  thoughts. Wake in morning and think of her, last thought at night of her. Every  action Zhu Shu do, she think of Ying-Ying. We fight sometimes, but no matter  what, no matter how angry, always forgive and go on.”<p>
  “But <em>how</em> did  you know you liked her?”<p>
  The intake of breath was slight, but it made Zhu Shu  smile. “Let ask this. When Zhu Shu first find Ranma, he being pulled by pigtail  to school. Watch all day, and see Ranma get hit with ball. Why Ranma get hit?”<p>
  “Uh... I had something on my mind.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Yes. Zhu Shu see Ranma not take eyes  off Akane as she play ball. So distracted by watching not see ball.”<p>
  “Hey, it wasn’t like that. Hiroshi and Daisuke were  asking me if I’d done things with Akane.”<p>
  “That why Ranma not say anything for several minute  before ball hit? Seem to Zhu Shu he only stare.”<p>
  Ranma sat and stared at the pond, and for several long  minutes all Zhu Shu’s sharp ears could hear was the thump of two hearts  beating.<p>
  “Want know why Zhu Shu decide want help Ranma with  fiancée?” she finally asked.<p>
  “I guess,” he said as the chair in the room above gave  a soft creak.<p>
  “Watching when Ranma tell Akane she cute when smile.  Ranma too busy to see look in Akane eyes. Zhu Shu not.” Ranma looked at her for  a long moment, noting the half smile she was giving him.<p>
  “I caught her smiling to herself in a mirror later,  and she threw a lamp at me,” he said sourly. “I was just wanting to make sure  she was okay. She... she’s sweet on the doctor anyway...”<p>
  “Tofu?”<p>
  “Yeah, she gets all shy when he’s around. And the  other day we were at his clinic when Kasumi arrived. Well, you saw how he is  around Kasumi. It really upset Akane. She was acting really strange.”<p>
  “And you try cheer up?”<p>
  “Yeah, it just backfired, like everything else I try  to do nice,” Ranma groused.<p>
  “Maybe should give Akane time. Just be nice.”<p>
  “I <em>was</em> trying. I was trying really hard that first day. She was so nice to me, and we  sparred and it was fun. I was really enjoying being with her. Then I found out  she hates boys, and when she walked in on me in the bath, well, it just seemed  to ruin everything. Then our idiot dads forced this engagement on us, and  Kasumi and Nabiki shoved Akane forward, and, well, it was like I was some  undesirable piece of trash and nobody wanted me, so I was being dropped on her  because she was the youngest. I could tell I wasn’t wanted. I was going to go  back to China  to find you and get this curse removed.”<p>
  “Why didn’t?”<p>
  “Well... Akane insulted me. Then whacked me over the  head with a table when I insulted her back.”<p>
  “What say?” Zhu Shu asked curiously.<p>
  “Well, she’d been going on and on about how I was a  pervert because I’d looked at her when she walked in on me, so I told her it  wasn’t a big deal for me to see a naked woman, because I turn into a girl, and  that besides, I was built better.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked at him wide-eyed. “You say what?” she  asked in disbelief.<p>
  “I said I was better built, and she hit me with a  table.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu no blame her!”<p>
  “What?”<p>
  “Ranma, women looks very important to women. You male,  you no understand. What you do almost worst insult can give. Like someone say  Ranma poor martial artist. Remember cheerleader? Zhu Shu say not pretty, she go  berserk. Only way Zhu Shu make madder, if had commented that Zhu Shu have  bigger breast.”<p>
  Ranma gave her a wide eye look. “How about commenting  on wide hips?”<p>
  “As bad. Ranma say to Akane?”<p>
  “Yeah.”<p>
  “And she <em>still</em> talk to? Think Ranma should consider.”<p>
  The creaking of the chair indicated someone was  muffling laughter. Ranma was too absorbed in moping to notice.<p>
  “Man, I’m never going to understand women.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “No worry. Zhu Shu help.”<p>
  “Thanks.” Ranma stood and stretched, his vertebra  popping as he extended, then shook himself. “Gods, what would I do without you?”<p>
  “Make mess. Is why Zhu Shu have work so hard to fix.”<p>
  Ranma scratched the back of his head as he gave a  rueful grin. “Yeah. Well, I gotta get to bed. Pop always drags me awake at dawn  to train.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu know,” the Chinese girl said with a wry grin.  “Is why does forms in dojo.”<p>
  Ranma raised an eyebrow, then blushed. “Oh...” He gave  a small chuckle. “You still do them that way?”<p>
  “Zhu Shu not have choice. No dress survive workout. Is  discovering actually like better.”<p>
  “Don’t you worry about someone seeing you?”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow. “Why? Zhu Shu not ashamed  of self. Is only problem when males bother.   Zhu Shu have bathed with males many time at village.  Only one hot spring.”<p>
  “I guess. But why does Akane jump my case about having  no feminine modesty when I’m wringing out my shirt, then?”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave him a half-smile. “No know. Japanese have  curious notions.  Very strange people  are.”<p>
  “Hey! I’m Japanese!”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “See? Prove point.”<p>
  Ranma rolled his eyes. “You and your strange sense of  humor. I can never tell when you’re joking, sometimes.” He leaned down to give  Zhu Shu a hand up. “Well. I really gotta get some sleep. See ya tomorrow.” With  a last wave, he vanished into the house.<p>
  Zhu Shu waited until he had been gone for a minute  before she raised her voice. “He really do care. Just not know how say.”<p>
  Akane leaned out the window and gave Zhu Shu a  surprised look. “You knew I was here?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked up at her and tapped her head. “When  cursed, get very sharp ears.<p>
  Akane looked at the long, pointed ears and smiled. “Absolutely.  Oh! By the way, did you realize your eyes reflect like a cat’s?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Zhu Shu have practice in cursed form.  And see in mirror.”<p>
  “Oh... well... Thank you for defending me.”<p>
  “Not do. Think overreact.”<p>
  “Huh?”<p>
  “Ranma may insult, not reason to hit with table.”<p>
  “He deserved it!”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave her a level gaze. After a few seconds,  Akane looked away.<p>
  “Okay, so maybe it was overreacting... but I was  stressed out. He’d just shown up in the bathroom, and then Dad insisted he had  to choose one of us, and Nabiki and Kasumi ganged up on me!”<p>
  “Yes. Ranma tell.”<p>
  “Oh, yeah, that’s right.” Akane frowned as she  recalled Ranma’s words. “I guess I never really thought how <em>he</em> was feeling then. Just about how put  upon <em>I </em>felt.”<p>
  “Always two sides of story.”<p>
  “I know.”<p>
  “So how does hear what Ranma feel make feel?”<p>
  “I don’t know. Confused.”<p>
  “Want talk about?”<p>
  Akane stared off at where Ranma had vanished into the  house for a long moment before shaking her head. “I think I want to think about  it first.”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “That not typical.”<p>
  Akane gave her a duplicate of Ranma’s rueful grin. “I  know. That’s why I want to think about it.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded her head in agreement, not pushing.<p>
  Akane waved. “Well, I need to finish my homework and  get to bed. See you in the morning.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu also.” She stood in the garden for a few  seconds longer as Akane pulled back inside and closed her window then walked  around to the dining room. Poking her head in the kitchen, she smiled at  Kasumi, who was sitting with a cup of tea and a magazine. “Kasumi right. Make  Ranma tell how felt first night, and Akane hear. Thank you for open window.”<p>
  Kasumi smiled. “You’re welcome, Zhu-chan. I hope it  helps them work things out a little better. Akane has been so… so… <em>impulsive</em> since Mother died. Sometimes  it takes extraordinary methods to get her to think.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu sees. Is good night. Zhu Shu see in morning.”<p>
  “Good night, dear. I filled the tub for you a few  minutes ago, and left you a tea set. Try not to fall asleep in the tub and  drown.”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Will do best.” She left the kitchen  to Kasumi’s contented smile.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>The following morning, breakfast was quieter than  normal. Ranma kept glancing at Akane, and she kept looking over at him. Both  Kasumi and Zhu Shu exchanged smiles at the behavior. It had been over twelve  hours and not a single fight. So far, so good.<p>
  After breakfast, Zhu Shu walked to school with Nabiki.  As they left the house, the Chinese girl asked, “What odds Nabiki give Zhu Shu?”<p>
  Nabiki blinked and turned to her. “You knew?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “Kasumi tell.”<p>
  “Oh. Well, I know how Ai fights, and I’ve never seen  you fight before yesterday. I actually gave odds against you. Even after the  way you dealt with Kuno, I thought Ai would win.” Nabiki shrugged. “I’ll know  better next time.”<p>
  “Cheerleaders tough. Zhu Shu not manage take out one  by one, probably beat.”<p>
  “Yeah. How’d you know to taunt Kaede that way?”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “She wear much make up. Was easy to  see vain.”<p>
  Nabiki nodded. “You’re observant too. That’s good.  And yes, Kaede is the second most vain girl  in Furinkan, topped only by her elder sister who is head of the art club.  Megumi is pretty well known for being a  tactician and pretty cool under pressure, but watch out for Ayeka.  She’s a really violent bitch when she looses  her temper, and she’s known for going berserk on people.  Kyoko really isn’t much of a threat, but  she’s a terrible flirt, and a prankster. Ai herself will probably leave you  alone for awhile, but sooner or later, she’s going to want a rematch.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shrugged. “Zhu Shu lose temper. Not fight  well. Use only Song school to fight. Zhu Shu think next time better if not.”<p>
  “Oh, you know other schools?”<p>
  “Just one. Zhu Shu learn Shiva Dance. Ribbon form.  Compliment Song school ribbon form.”<p>
  “Shiva? That’s a Hindu god, from India, isn’t  it?”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Yes. Learn from Indian Martial  Dancer.  Dance of Veils is strong defense  form.”<p>
  “That I gotta see.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave Nabiki a sidelong glance. “No, not think  Nabiki like. Nabiki not like girls like Zhu Shu like girls.”<p>
  “Huh, I don’t-“ She trailed off as understanding hit. “Oh.  One of those dances. And it’s a combat form?”<p>
  “Yes. Shiva god of Dance and Destruction.  Many dance part of full form.  Some for attack, some defend.  It compliment Song school well.”<p>
  “Ah. I’ll keep that in mind. Maybe you can demonstrate  for me some time.” Nabiki kept her face straight as the Chinese girl gave her  another sidelong look, thinking to herself, <em>the  videos of that would bring a fortune!</em> <p>
  At the school gate, Kuno was waiting.<p>
  “Ah, glorious Chinese Goddess, I would date with you!”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. “Here go again.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“So what have your travels discovered, Ke Lun?” The  Loremaster asked.<p>
  Ke Lun looked around the table at the gathered elders.  “It seems that Song Shi Wang survived the fall of the Clan’s stronghold.”<p>
  There was a murmur of surprise that ran among the  oldest of the elders present. The Loremaster raised an eyebrow. “Why did the  Weapons Master not come to us? He had to know we would hold to our oaths and  shelter the Clan.”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “Yes. I asked him that. He... did not  give a satisfactory answer. Shi has changed much from the man we knew in our  youth, Lo Shen”<p>
  “And what did you discover of the Heir?”<p>
  “Zhu Shu is the true Heir. She is the last pureblood  daughter of Lin Tzu.”<p>
  “So, she must be protected.” Lo Shen looked  thoughtful.<p>
  Ke Lun nodded. “She has been trained by Shi to defend  herself at least as well as any of our warriors, and she is with Shan Pu. I  await their next letter to advise me of where they are, and I will follow.”<p>
  “Is that wise, Matriarch? Would it not be better to  bring her home?”<p>
  Ke Lun shook her head. “I do not think so. Shi has  requested she be allowed to continue her search. I have no reason to go against  his wishes yet, but I do think Zhu Shu will need guidance to find a suitable  husband. It seems she shares in more than just Lin Tzu’s blood, she is a true  Daughter of the Dragon.  The Dragon’s  Blood has manifested within her.”<p>
  The Loremaster raised an eyebrow. “I see. That… is  unfortunate.  I suspected as much when  she seemed so reluctant to claim Ranma’s hand for herself.  It is a pity her quest will bring her only  unhappiness.”<p>
  Ke Lun steepled her fingers in front of her as she  gazed across the table. “There may be a resolution to this. I asked Zhu Shu to  accompany Shan Pu on her quest for more than just her knowledge of their  quarry. Shan Pu expressed her interest to me, and I gave her my approval to  seek Zhu Shu as a sister-wife. Zhu Shu… did not refuse, nor did she accept. If  Zhu Shu accepts Shan Pu’s affections, once they find Saotome it will provide  Zhu Shu with both what she desires in Shan Pu, while fulfilling her duty with  Saotome.”<p>
  “And as the boy is cursed to turn female, she may even  find some satisfaction with him in time.” Lo Shen nodded. “Then I agree with  you, Ke Lun. It is vital you oversee this.   Her happiness is less important than bearing an heir, but I would still  prefer not to see her miserable.”<p>
  Ke Lun the woman a sardonic grin. “I trust you’ll keep  things under control here until I return?”<p>
  The Loremaster gave her a return grin. “Of course.”  She folded her hands over her staff. “I know we have often been rivals, Ke Lun,  even as we have been friends, but this overshadows petty political bickering.  Until the matter of Clan Dragon is resolved, the Amazons will stand united  behind you. We failed our oath once. We will not do so a second time.”<p>
  “I will hold you to that, Lo Shen.” Ke Lun tapped her  fingers on the table as she debated whether she should mention her other worry,  but in the end decided the other elders needed to know. “There is more. I am concerned  about Zhu Shu’s curse.”<p>
  The Loremaster leaned forward. “You advised us that  she has a humanoid cursed form, and that it wouldn’t endanger her in a fight,  but I sensed then that there was more. Have you finally decided to share that  with us?”<p>
  “I did not at first feel it was something that truly  merited attention, yet it has nagged at me since. And I was concerned as to the  reaction it might bring. Zhu Shu’s curse seems… less random than usual.  Jusenkyo is known for the irony with which its curse strikes, seemingly always  to curse with a form that is intended to teach a lesson of some sort, though  rarely does it seem that anyone knows what that lesson is to be. In Zhu Shu’s  case, I wonder truly what that lesson is meant to be.”<p>
  “You’re talking around the point, Ke Lun,” The  Loremaster said.<p>
  Ke Lun sighed. “Zhu Shu seems to have fallen into the  worst possible spring she could have for anyone’s peace of mind, Lo Shen.  Particularly yours, mine, and Shi’s.”<p>
  “And that would be?”<p>
  “Let me just say I can verify that the daughter of  Garlic is dead… Of drowning.”<p>
  Lo Shen’s eyes widened. “Oh my.  Did Shi…”<p>
  Ke Lun shook her head.   “He will not tell me what happened between them in the end, but I am  certain that he met her the night Clan Dragon fell.  He states only that she did not die by his  hand.”<p>
  Lo Shen nodded.   “I have never been sure of her death till now.  When we could not find her body among the  dead...”<p>
  A commotion outside the elder’s hall stole their  attention a second before pounding began on the door to the village square. The  guard opened the door to inquire and a moment later allowed a runner to enter  the hall. She approached the elder’s table and knelt. “Forgive the intrusion,  Revered elders, but I have been sent with a strange message for Ke Lun.”<p>
  Ke Lun signaled for the runner to rise. “What is it,  child?”<p>
  “Our sister in Tokyo  was approached two days ago by a strange woman, and asked to deliver this  message to the Warleader.” She held forth a rolled scroll. Ke Lun unrolled it  and read the elegantly brushed symbols.<p>
  <em>To Ke Lun,  Warleader of the Joketsuzoku, Daughter of Po Shen and Guardian of Shan Pu,  Champion of the Joketsuzoku and Daughter of Par Fume, greetings.</em> <p>
  <em>I beg you to  come to Tokyo at your earliest convenience, and if at all possible within a  week of receiving this missive, to bear witness to an event of utmost  importance to the Joketsuzoku and to Shan Pu’s future happiness. At that time,  a deed shall be performed that shall enable the Joketsuzoku to lay to rest  ancient grievances against one who has wronged the Tribe, and Warleader Ke Lun.  There are further details to this need for a Witness that I do not feel should  be relegated to this missive, but must be discussed in personal conference.</em> <p>
  <em>Again, I beg  you to come to Tokyo with all haste, as the time of this event is not entirely  certain, but will occur within the fortnight.</em> <p>
  <em>Urd, Norn of  the Past, Goddess Second Class, Limited.</em> <p>
  Ke Lun raised an eyebrow at the signature. “A message  from one who claims to be a goddess. Now there’s a first.”<p>
  The Loremaster was studying the scroll. “There is a  strong sense of enchantment within the scroll. I think perhaps had you been  anywhere in the world, this scroll would have found its way to you.”<p>
  “Do you believe its author is who she says she is?  Would a goddess send a message so mundanely?”<p>
  A rumble of thunder broke the quite afternoon air as  the air within the hall shook. The hall door swung open to reveal a smoking  patch of ground just outside the door.<p>
  Ke Lun and Lo Shen hobbled over on their staffs and looked  down at the glowing symbols on the marble plaque that rested at the center of  the scorch marks on the ground. The two elders looked at one another. Lo Shen  gave Ke Lun an amused smile.<p>
  “I would say that answers your question, Warleader. My  advice would be to ‘get thee hence’ to Tokyo.”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>“Gods, how does she make it look so easy?” Usagi  whined as she rubbed the small of her back. “I’m never going to be able to do  any of those impossible contortions she’s trying to get us into!”<p>
  “Zhu-sensei is simply making us do basic exercises,  Usagi,” Makoto replied, looking out the window of the bus that was taking them  back to Juuban after their Thursday afternoon class at the Tendo dojo. “You’d  get better at them if you’d do them more often. They’re not <em>that</em> different than the ones I usually  do before my workouts, just geared more for flexibility.”<p>
  “Yes. We’re all sore, Usagi-chan. But I researched  some of the exercises last night, and according to my data, it’s very similar  to a ballerina or a gymnast’s exercises,” Ami added from where she was rubbing  sore calves. “Once we’ve gotten used to them, we can progress to the actual  dances Zhu-sensei showed us.”<p>
  “And I can’t wait to try some of her dances at a club,”  Mina chimed in. “I can just imagine how the boys will just go crazy over me!”<p>
  Only Rei stared out the window of the bus, lost in  thought as the rest of the Senshi continued their discussion. As the bus pulled  into the Ginza district of Juuban, she gave a  start as she realized someone was talking to her.<p>
  “Rei?” Usagi said again.<p>
  “What?”<p>
  “I asked you if you wanted to come with us to that new  okonomiyaki restaurant. The chef is supposed to be like drop-dead gorgeous!”<p>
  She shrugged. “Yeah, I guess.”<p>
  She followed the other Senshi to the restaurant,  proudly displaying a canopy over the door proclaiming its name to be Uc-chan’s,  and settled in at the counter. Usagi and Mina almost drooled over the young man  behind the counter as they ordered their okonomiyaki and watched as he made and  served them in under a minute. Rei sat and picked at hers until Usagi finally  asked. “What’s up, Rei? You’ve been like a total space case since we left the  dojo.”<p>
  Rei looked up. “You’re one to talk.”<p>
  “Come on. Something’s wrong. You can tell me. I’ll bet  it’s about some boy, right?” You could almost see hearts in her eyes as she put  an arm around Rei’s shoulder. “You’ve fallen desperately in love with a cute  guy and you don’t know how to tell him you love him, right?”<p>
  Rei shrugged Usagi’s arm off. “Some of us do think  about other things occasionally, Usagi! No, I’m worried about Zhu Shu, if you  must know.”<p>
  “Why? She told us that she can handle Ai on her own,  and besides, she’s like two grade levels our senior. We really can’t invade her  school and teach those cheerleaders a lesson.”<p>
  “That’s not it. I just keep thinking about the other  morning. That woman who came and told Zhu-chan where to find Ranma was an evil  spirit of some sort, and I can’t help but think that she was some sort of ill  omen. I just keep getting these weird sensations when we’re near Zhu Shu that  something evil is lurking, waiting to cause her trouble. And I know she asked  us not to tell Akane about Shampoo, or that Zhu Shu’s supposed to get Ranma  married to Shampoo, but I keep feeling that trouble’s going to come of it.”<p>
  “You worry too much, Rei. Zhu Shu knows what she’s  doing. She said the Amazon’s allow multiple wives, so all she has to do is get  Ranma and Akane to accept Shampoo as a second wife. Sounds like most guys’ wet  dream to me.”<p>
  The chef was suddenly standing across the counter from  them. Startled, the two girls looked up at the clean-shaven young man, and felt  their hearts go flutter, though from surprise or the young chef’s bishonen  looks, they couldn’t tell.<p>
  “Excuse me. Did you say Ranma?”<p>
  Usagi nodded, her eyes locked on the chef as her brain  nearly shut down at the thought that this handsome hunk was actually talking to  her!<p>
  “Ranma Saotome?”<p>
  Rei raised an eyebrow. “You know him?”<p>
  The chef gave a wry grin. “Yeah, you could say that.  Me and him go way back. Sure would like to see him again. Last time was when I  was six. Can you tell me where he’s at these days?”<p>
  “Oh, he’s going to school at Furinkan!” Usagi said  before Rei’s sharp elbow jabbed her ribs. “Ow! Whaddja do that for.”<p>
  Rei rolled her eyes then looked at the chef. “So you  knew Ranma when you were six?”<p>
  “Yeah, he used to steal okonomiyaki from my dad’s  yattai. We used to spar and hang out together. You say he’s got a fiancée?”<p>
  “Something like that.”<p>
  “I’ll have to stop by and congratulate him, the stud.  And a girlfriend on the side?”<p>
  “It’s nothing like that!” Usagi said, still rubbing  the sore spot on her ribs. She stopped at a glare from Rei. “Um. It’s  complicated.”<p>
  The chef laughed. “I’ll bet it is. I wonder if he’ll  remember me. I named this restaurant after his nickname for me.”<p>
  “Uc-chan?”<p>
  “Yeah. Ukyou Kuonji.”<p>
  Mina had finally noticed the conversation, having been  looking at a group of cute boys at the front of the restaurant. “Kuonji? Like  the okonomiyaki chain?”<p>
  “Yep. My family owns the corporation. Dad wants me to  prove I can handle the challenges of the business, so I set up my own  restaurant.”<p>
  “Wow,” Mina muttered to Usagi. “Cute <em>and</em> rich.”<p>
  “Well, I got customers to serve. Nice meeting you.  Glad to know Ran-chan’s doing well. Maybe I’ll look him up if I ever get time.”<p>
  “Yeah, sure,” Rei said. The chef waved and headed off  to a customer at the far end of the counter. Once he was out of earshot, Usagi  turned to her.<p>
  “Why’d ya elbow me like that, Rei? I was just making  conversation.”<p>
  “But we don’t know him. You shouldn’t talk about Ranma  with him.”<p>
  Mina looked puzzled. “Why not? I mean, he’s like so  cute, and they’re old friends.”<p>
  “Yeah, he’s almost as dreamy as Mamoru,” Usagi added.<p>
  Rei looked at the chef again, busy serving customers. “I  don’t know. I guess I’m just being paranoid. He <em>is</em> cute.”<p>
  “Oh, yeah. I mean, just look at that butt!” Mina  drooled.<p>
  Makoto overheard. “Yeah. He reminds me of my sempai.”<p>
  The giggles caused Ami to look up from her computer,  where she was studying for tomorrows science quiz. “What?”<p>
  That brought more giggles…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>As the Senshi departed the restaurant a half hour  later, Ukyou looked up from her grill to watch them go.<p>
  “So Ran-chan has a fiancée and a girlfriend, eh? Well  guess what, Ran-chan, you two-timing womanizer. Your days as a ladies man are  almost over. My revenge will finally be had!”<p>
  She looked down at the okonomiyaki she had made, with  the little skull face with x’s for eyes, and gave a grim smile.<p>
  Unnoticed between sauce pots behind her, a Chibi Urd  raised an eyebrow and rechecked her notes. There it was, Ukyou Kuonji: Ranma  fiancée number three. Yggdrasil had been very clear she was one of the major  threads affected by the wish. For good or ill, she had to come to Nerima and  play her part.<p>
  Urd just wished she knew what that part was supposed  to be.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon found the two youngest Tendo  sisters and their Chinese guest shopping at the Nerima mall. Zhu Shu had ripped  another dress while giving lessons, and while she had been sewing it, Akane and  Nabiki had invited her along. Thinking it would be better to try and find a stronger  dress than attempting to repair the flimsy material, she had accepted.<p>
  Zhu Shu looked at the dress in the mirror and adjusted  it across her hip, finally looking up at the sales clerk and smiling. “Zhu Shu  very happy with dress. Is first dress she find in Japan she think decent.”<p>
  The clerk gave her a cardboard smile. “Well, we do aim  to please, and all of our cheongsams are imported from China.”<p>
  “Ah. That why so good.” She checked the rest of the  small stack the clerk had brought out and was pleased to discover they were all  imports. While they were still not of the quality she was hoping for, they were  certainly far better than the ones she had currently.<p>
  “Do you like them?” Akane asked. She looked anxiously  at the Chinese girl.<p>
  Zhu Shu turned to model the gold-trimmed red silk  dress, noting the other girl’s hopeful expression. “Yes. Zhu Shu think Akane  make good suggestion of store. Thank you for bringing Zhu Shu along for  shopping.”<p>
  Nabiki looked over from where she was looking through  some business-like dresses. “Think nothing of it. I needed to get a new outfit  anyway, and Kasumi suggested we take you with us and get you some decent  dresses.” She looked at the short Mandarin dress Zhu Shu had on and whistled. “Damn.  That does look good on you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu turned to look at the back of the dress in the  three way mirror. “Yes. Zhu Shu think will do fine. And like way mirror let see  all of dress.”<p>
  “You’ve never seen a three-way mirror?” Akane said.<p>
  “No. Zhu Shu never see mirror so big at all. So much  Zhu Shu see she never see before. Sometimes confusing is.”<p>
  “What’s it like in your home village?” Akane asked.<p>
  Zhu Shu stepped back into the changing booth and  closed the door. “Is much smaller than Tokyo.  Only thirty house. Maybe hundred people in village. Magistrate have generator  and jeep. Keep radio in Communist office. Zhu Shu think like Tokyo much better, even though much  strangeness here.”<p>
  Nabiki nodded. “Yeah. I guess it would seem strange to  you. You’ve been doing fine catching up in school though.”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Is very interesting. So much Zhu Shu  never know she no know. She train serve and manage Emperor’s household, but  find so much else need learn here.” She poked her head out of the changing  booth to motion at the glass doors of the store that led into the mall’s  interior. “Like stairs that move.”<p>
  Akane smiled at the memory of Zhu Shu’s hesitance to  step on the escalator to come to this floor. “That was rather funny.”<p>
  Zhu Shu stuck her tongue out at the youngest Tendo  sister. “Maybe for Akane.”<p>
  She ducked her head back into the booth and emerged a  second later in another cheongsam, this one white with gold plum blossoms  adorning it. Akane raised an eyebrow.<p>
  “That’s absolutely fabulous, but it’s almost too thin.  You might want to get a bra for it too.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu not find one can stand. Too constricting. She  do exercises keep breast firm.”<p>
  “I was thinking more about the faint visibility  problem than how busty you are.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked down to where her nipples were just  barely detectable through the white silk. “No. Zhu Shu just need avoid get wet.”<p>
  Nabiki laughed. “I think with your curse, that’s going  to be impossible.”<p>
  “So Zhu Shu need get umbrella. Will keep Hentai Squad  from shooting with water.”<p>
  “Your umbrella against an entire arsenal of squirt  guns? That should be fun.” Nabiki said with a grin.<p>
  “So why Nabiki sell Hentai guns in first place?”<p>
  “Hey, a girl’s got to make a profit somehow.”<p>
  “Nabiki! You’re the one who sold them squirt guns? How  could you?!” Akane asked, outraged.<p>
  Zhu Shu waved it away. “Zhu Shu no mind. Get better at  dodge. Good practice.”<p>
  “Yeah, but everyone at school thinks you’re weird. And  Ai’s been spreading the story that you like girls.” Akane protested.<p>
  “So? Is true. It not stop Kuno, or half boys in school  try date. Zhu Shu get forty stuffies this week!”<p>
  “Well, at least they’re not trying to defeat you in  combat,” Nabiki said wryly, with a nod at Akane.<p>
  “Yeah, but half the girls are calling her a pervert.  And I’ve got Yuka and Sayuri asking me if the rumors are true. I don’t know  what to tell them.”<p>
  “Tell is true. Zhu Shu no care.” What was the point,  really? Once she had revealed her shame, it had been inevitable that it would  get out. She’d never told Shan Pu, but it had been obvious the Amazon had  known, and seemed interested, Rei suspected and was curious, and now the Tendo’s  knew and didn’t seem to care. She was beginning to enjoy the fact she didn’t  have to hide her preferences as much, and if those manga she had gotten from  some of the Hentai Squad were indicative of Japanese attitudes, she wasn’t too  worried about it. If anything, it seemed to show that Japanese girls could be  very active that way, though she’d managed to translate little beyond the main  characters names and the fact that Melon and Non were best friends. Maybe she  should ask Kasumi for help translating it.<p>
  Zhu Shu folded up the rest of the dresses and tried to  get the attention of the clerk, who had wandered back to her counter and was  studiously ignoring her and the other shoppers in the small clothing store. She  frowned. “How Zhu Shu get dress if clerk no sell?”<p>
  Nabiki raised an eyebrow. “Just take them to the  counter.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked. “Ah. Very different in China.  Shopkeeper try very hard sell. Clerk act like not care if buy.”<p>
  Nabiki shrugged. “She doesn’t. She gets paid whether  you buy or not.”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow. “Very strange.” She took  the dresses to the counter, Akane and Nabiki following behind her. “Zhu Shu  want buy now.”<p>
  The clerk pasted on another false smile. “Certainly.  Will that be cash or charge?”<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked. “Not understand. What charge?”<p>
  “Just give us a total, please,” Nabiki interjected.<p>
  The clerk counted up the dresses and tapped the keys  on her register. “That’ll be 19,000 yen.” she said in a bored tone.<p>
  Zhu Shu blinked, and pulled her purse from behind her  back. She pulled out a small wad of bills and started counting them.<p>
  “Wait a minute, Zhu-chan,” Nabiki said. Addressing the  clerk, she continued, “I think you forgot those dresses were on sale.”<p>
  The clerk checked her register and then the tags on  the dresses. “Okay. 17,000 yen.” she said with an equal lack of emotion.<p>
  Zhu Shu had finished counting her paper money. “Zhu  Shu only have 15,000.” She looked at the five dresses. She really didn’t want  to give any of them up.<p>
  Nabiki shrugged. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll cover the  rest. You can pay me back later.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked into her purse again. “Zhu Shu have  other money. Is Chinese.” She pulled out a large coin and held it up. “10, 000  yuan piece.”<p>
  Nabiki looked at the coin and blinked. “Um... Zhu  Shu... is that gold?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.<p>
  “How many of those do you have?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked into her bag. “Forty, fifty left.  Grandfather give Zhu Shu two hundred when leave on quest.”<p>
  “Do you have any idea how much those are worth?”<p>
  “10,000 yuan. Zhu Shu say already. Things not cost so  much in China.  Zhu Shu not have spend much for supply.”<p>
  Nabiki slid a rectangle of plastic to the clerk. “Put  it on my card.” She closed her hand over the coin in Zhu Shu’s hand. “Put those  away, Zhu-chan. We’re going to have to have a little talk about rare and  antique coinage. Then we’re going to a bank to deposit those…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>By Sunday, the temporary truce between Ranma and Akane  was showing signs of strain, but it was holding. While Akane and Ranma had  sparred with words, no actual physical violence was in the offing yet. Akane  had taken to helping Zhu Shu with her Japanese Kanji, and while they gaily conversed  on topics that ranged from manga and anime to which pop star’s music they liked  best, Akane had been reluctant to talk about Ranma.<p>
  But finally, on Sunday evening, as they were reading  the week’s Sunday Digest, Akane decided she wanted to talk.<p>
  “I’ve been thinking all week about what you asked me.”  Akane said out of the blue as they were reading the latest installment of Negima,  Akane helping Zhu Shu with the Japanese text. Zhu Shu looked up and blinked.<p>
  “Question?”<p>
  “If... if I loved him. I’ve been thinking about it. I  really don’t know the answer.” She sat up on the bed and leaned against the  wall. “I mean, in stories, it’s always this huge overwhelming feeling that just  hits, and wham, you’re in love. I just don’t know if that’s what I feel.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Zhu Shu never feel either.”<p>
  “But you’ve been in love?”<p>
  “Yes.”<p>
  Akane sighed. “He’s so aggravating! He can be so  thoughtless, and he drops insults constantly. It’s like he’s always looking for  a fight!”<p>
  “Ranma live whole life be best. Is all knows. Not know  how not compete. Panda man very bad at teach manners.”<p>
  “You once said he didn’t know ‘the way of hearts’.”<p>
  “No. He not know how be gentle. Must train.”<p>
  “And I want a knight in shining armor, who’s a perfect  gentleman.”<p>
  “Ranma not, but could be. Not know how. Try, but like  man stumble in dark.”<p>
  Akane sighed. “It’s just... he’s nice looking, but he’s  so arrogant, and to top it off, he turns into a girl. It was rather unnerving  at first.”<p>
  “What Akane think now?”<p>
  “I don’t know really. I’m used to it now.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu like he be girl. Very sexy. Body nice look  at. Like look Akane too. Ranma fuller breast, but Akane more feminine. Pretty  hips.” She gave Akane a smile. “But Ranma too male for Zhu Shu taste, even when  girl.”<p>
  Akane gave her a sidelong glance and rolled her eyes. “I’m  glad <em>someone</em> likes my hips. Ranma  just says they’re wide.”<p>
  “No. Akane just not develop curves. Concentrate on  strength, not form. Keep help with students, Akane get rounder.” She stood and  stretched, noting the long look Akane gave her and sighing mentally. Why couldn’t  Ranma see how sexy Akane was? “Think Zhu Shu look like this she if not do  forms? Work hard make body pleasing to eye.”<p>
  Akane sighed. “I’m never going to look like you, Zhu  Shu. And you’re an exception to most gymnasts with those breasts.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu let Akane know secret?”<p>
  “Sure.”<p>
  “Zhu Shu not always like her breast. Before  Grandfather figure out exercise for Zhu Shu to use keep firm, she have backache  all time. Exercise work, but make breast seem bigger. Now curse form bigger  yet. Trust Zhu Shu, not be jealous.”<p>
  “Yeah, but if I had a bust as big as yours, I’d have  every guy in school drooling.”<p>
  “Akane seem do already.”<p>
  Akane blinked. “Well, yeah. I guess. But you know what  I mean.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave her a sidelong glance. “If Zhu Shu teach  exercise, Akane get bigger.”<p>
  Akane laughed softly. “You think he’ll stop calling me  sexless then?”<p>
  Zhu Shu spread her hands. “Only time tell.” She smiled  as she went back to looking at the manga, thinking how wrong Ranma was with  that insult. “Only time tell…”<p>
  It was a start.</p>
