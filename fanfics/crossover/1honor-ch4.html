<a href="../crossover/1honor-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        Ryouko felt the tension on her bridge as the Gryphon ships 
approached their fleet, slowing as they neared the Washu&#39;s Revenge. Yuri 
tilted her head to the side, her glossy black hair flowing like water as 
she said, &quot;The Gryphon fleet is requesting communication.&quot;

        &quot;Put them on,&quot; Ryouko ordered, her mane of blue hair coursing 
wildly down her back.

        Commander Honor Harrington appeared on the screen, several 
admirals and diplomats arrayed beside her. Her face was grave, revealing 
nothing. &quot;Warlord Ryouko?&quot; the brown haired young woman in military garb 
asked.

        &#39;They&#39;re declining our offer,&#39; Ryouko thought grimly, but forced 
herself to stay calm. &quot;Yes, Commander?&quot; she asked formally.

        &quot;As I was the first one to open communications with you, it was 
felt I was the best one to deliver our Queen&#39;s response,&quot; Honor said, 
deadpan. She took a breath, a slight smile curved her lips and she said, 
&quot;We accept.&quot;

        It took a moment for it to sink in, then the bridge of the 
Washu&#39;s Revenge broke out in cheers. Ryouko felt herself grinning, glad 
to see a similar emotion on Honor&#39;s face. &quot;Manticore is honored to 
accept Gryphon into our numbers,&quot; she said with a grin.

        &quot;There&#39;s a lot of work still to do,&quot; the leader of the 
diplomats, Langtry, said, &quot;but a lot of it can be dealt with on our way 
to Basilisk. We&#39;ll send over our people while we prepare for a public 
ceremony on Basilisk itself.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Washu agreed, the redheaded scientist 
looking visibly relieved.

        &quot;Let&#39;s move out,&quot; Minagi said, Ryouko&#39;s twin moving to action. 
The scars that marked her cheeks gave her an oddly gentle look, but 
still capable and dangerous.

        &quot;I look forward to seeing you,&quot; Ryouko smiled before the Gryphon 
ship broke contact.

        It wasn&#39;t long before they met in a meeting room in the Washu&#39;s 
Revenge, discussing how the alliance between their forces could work. 
Admiral White-Haven, the silver haired senior was just finishing off his 
proposals with, &quot;... and that&#39;s our proposal.&quot;

        &quot;Empress?&quot; Ryouko blinked. &quot;You want to make me an Empress?&quot; she 
repeated, having some difficulty with accepting the idea.

        &quot;It has some merit,&quot; Washu spoke up thoughtfully, &quot;with how 
quickly Manticore&#39;s sphere of influence is growing, it&#39;s not too 
unreasonable.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s another reason as well,&quot; Honor spoke up, her voice 
soft. She smiled a bit wryly, &quot;Warlord is a rather dangerous title for a 
leader, no matter how well earned. Empress, on the other hand, is a bit 
more acceptable.&quot;

        &quot;It also gives me a greater rank than Queen,&quot; Ryouko murmured, 
&quot;helping save face with your ruler.&quot; She sighed, &quot;Guess I can live with 
it.&quot;

        &quot;Bleek,&quot; Nimitz commented cheerfully from the treecat&#39;s place on 
Honor&#39;s shoulder.

        They talked for hours, mostly Washu and Langtry, with the others 
stepping in as necessary. The final agreement would need to be ratified 
by Queen Elizabeth when they reached the planet, but the diplomats were 
confident it would be accepted.

        &quot;All right,&quot; Minagi stretched out once they finished, her 
skintight bodysuit clinging to her form as she said, &quot;who wants to eat?&quot;

        Admiral Courvosier smiled slightly as he said, &quot;I&#39;d be honored.&quot; 
The former tactics teachers spoke with members of Ryouko&#39;s staff easily 
as they filed out of the room, a bond clearly forming between the two 
groups.

        &quot;Honor,&quot; Ryouko fell into step beside her. She smiled at the 
still shy officer as she said, &quot;If you want to wait for dinner, I could 
give you a tour of the ship.&quot;

        Honor hesitated, then the brown haired young woman smiled back 
at her. &quot;Actually I&#39;d like to,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ve heard a lot about it.&quot;

        &quot;Then come on,&quot; Ryouko said, noticing the worried look that 
Washu gave her as the two slipped away. She gave her mother Washu a 
reassuring smile, but she rather thought that the woman wasn&#39;t buying 
it.

        Ryouko noticed that Honor kept her eyes open as they walked, the 
girl soaking up details of the ship around her. The few members of the 
crew they passed gave Ryouko casual waves while tossing Honor thoughtful 
looks. Dressed in various clothes of Manticore there were no uniforms 
though they all treated Ryouko with great respect.

        &#39;Guess it&#39;s been a while since I took a lady aside,&#39; Ryouko 
thought.

        &quot;Either everyone is at their posts,&quot; Honor finally commented, 
&quot;or you really are running these ships on skeleton crews.&quot;

        &quot;They&#39;re not at their posts,&quot; Ryouko sighed.

        Ryouko ducked through a hatch, the two of them entering a larger 
chamber. The far side was a window providing a wonderful view of the 
ships all around them. Off in the distance the planet of Basilisk 
turned, slowly growing larger as they approached.

        Honor took in the ships, the more primitive Gryphon ships 
alongside the powerful Manticore vessels. She rested her hand on the 
transparent alloy, then turned back to Ryouko. &quot;You know that having us 
join your forces will change things,&quot; she said.

        Ryouko flashed a smile, Honor really was sharp. &quot;Uniforms and 
all, I think,&quot; she said with a wry smile. &quot;You&#39;re people have had a 
organized military far longer than we have, adopting your systems would 
be simpler,&quot; Ryouko said.

        Honor looked a bit surprised, &quot;I thought Manticore had a 
military tradition....&quot;

        Ryouko laughed, &quot;No, we just fought each other a lot.&quot; She 
pushed her hair back, &quot;Single combat was always our focus, not group 
military action and unit organization.&quot;

        Honor&#39;s eyes widened slightly. &quot;I knew it was an achievement 
that you organized Manticore into a spacefaring world,&quot; she finally 
said, &quot;and after hearing that I&#39;m even more impressed.&quot;

        Ryouko felt her cheeks redden slightly, cursing the automatic 
reaction as she fought to get it under control. &#39;She&#39;s taken, remember,&#39; 
she reminded herself of that fact ruthlessly. Ryouko took a steadying 
breath and said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        &quot;Considering your reputation,&quot; Honor said with a slight smile on 
her face, &quot;my crewmates are going to be wondering if you are having your 
way with me.&quot;

        Ryouko had to fight back a laugh at that, a bit startled by 
Honor&#39;s boldness. &quot;Youthful indiscretions,&quot; she waved a hand with a 
smile, &quot;I was a bit wild before.&quot; She turned to Honor and raised an 
eyebrow, &quot;Worried?&quot;

        &quot;No, according to those very same stories you&#39;re honorable,&quot; 
Honor said mildly.

        Ryouko snickered softly. &quot;You know, I think I like you,&quot; she 
slapped the stunned girl on the back with a grin. &quot;You&#39;re right though, 
we&#39;d better get back to the others.&quot;

        As they navigated back towards the dining hall Honor noted, &quot;You 
seemed awfully focused on taking on Kagato when we first talked.&quot;

        Ryouko offered her hand, gently tugging honor through a low 
gravity bubble in the ship. &quot;He&#39;s holding family of mine,&quot; Ryouko 
admitted, &quot;and we&#39;re going to make him regret it.&quot;

        Honor&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;That&#39;s why your ship is called Washu&#39;s 
Revenge!&quot;

        Ryouko grinned, &quot;Got it in one.&quot;

        It took only hours to complete the voyage to the planet of 
Basilisk, The Washu&#39;s Revenge settling into a high orbit. The Gryphon 
fleet representatives went down first, then they waited for Ryouko and 
her party to arrive. All around them a full military party was ready, 
their dress uniforms gleaming and weapons polished.

        From the clouds it descended, an angular vessel made up of 
gleaming black crystal. It swept down towards them, hovering above the 
landing field as a scarlet transport sphere descended towards them. It 
touched down, revealing the three figures within it as the power 
dissipated.

        The great vessel above them dropped, murmurs of fear trailing 
off as it swiftly shrunk. In moments a small, furry cabbit sat at 
Ryouko&#39;s feet, looking around proudly. &quot;Myah!&quot; it exclaimed.

        The Queen&#39;s party moved forward, Elizabeth and her diplomats 
meeting Ryouko and her people as equals. &quot;Welcome to Basilisk, Empress 
Ryouko,&quot; Elizabeth offered her hand.

        Ryouko took it, meeting the dark skinned beauty&#39;s smile. &quot;It&#39;s 
an honor to be here, Queen Elizabeth,&quot; she replied.

        Covertly Ryouko scanned the crowd around them, noticing Honor 
was standing nearby her. Standing right beside her was a lady clearly 
related to Elizabeth, and from her stance the woman that Honor was 
interested in.

        &quot;Not bad,&quot; Minagi mused impishly, looking around with amusement.

        &quot;Hush,&quot; Washu scolded her softly.

        Later on Ryouko wondered if it had been her moment of 
distraction that gave the enemy the chance to strike, the opening that 
he needed. The officer broke out of ranks, pulling a sidearm as he cried 
out, &quot;No alien ruler!&quot;

        &quot;No!&quot; Honor moved like a shot, shoving Ryouko and the others 
backwards even as the weapon discharged loudly.

        &quot;Honor!&quot; Michelle cried out as Honor&#39;s shoulder exploded in a 
splash of blood.

        Minagi simply disappeared, she moved so fast, energy sword 
blazing as she cut down the man with a single stroke even as Ryouko ran 
over to Honor&#39;s side. &quot;Move,&quot; Washu ordered the others, kneeling down 
beside the wounded young woman.

        Nimitz&#39;s fur was all puffed up, a low growl coming from back of 
the treecat&#39;s throat as he stood guard over his human partner. Still, he 
surrendered his place to Washu, clearly aware that she meant no harm to 
Honor.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Honor asked softly, taking in the worried 
looks on the three women kneeling above her, reaching out to stroke 
Nimitz reassuringly.

        &quot;We&#39;re fine,&quot; Ryouko said as Michelle, tears streaking her face, 
all but shoved Minagi aside to kneel by Honor. &quot;And we&#39;ll make sure 
you&#39;ll be all right, too,&quot; Ryouko said as much for Michelle&#39;s sake as 
for Honor.</pre>
