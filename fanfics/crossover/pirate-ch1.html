fanfiction by <a href="../authors/vwatson.html">Vinson Watson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>After being saved by the Sailor Scouts from alien invaders, a young 
man trains in and martial arts and gunnery so one day he may join the 
Scouts. But because of his overly aggressive tactics, not to mention 
he had no super powers nor is he a girl, Gallian Vinsan is disallowed 
to join. After this he soon learns that an interplanetary criminal has 
created wristbands that emulated Sailor Mars&#39; and Sailor Moon&#39;s 
powers. With swiftness and cunning he moved to defeat the criminal and 
snatch the bands...for himself.

------------------------------------------------------------

 &quot;Whose the new boy?&quot; asked Utena. Anthy and Miki glanced at the 
unusual boy as he conversed with Kozue Kaoru, Miki&#39;s Sister, slightly 
pinning her against the lockers. Chuchu jumped from Anthy&#39;s shoulder 
onto Utena&#39;s and climbed to the top of her head so he could get a 
better look. The boy wore school colors, light blue pants but with a 
long matching trench instead of the usual jacket and a head scarf 
sporting the anarchy symbol tied around his head. Another odd thing 
about him was the collar of his shirt bared the appearance of those 
worn by sailors. His dark brown skin made him stand out even if his 
style of dress was ignored.

 &quot;I don&#39;t know but I think I should find out.&quot; said Miki.

 &quot;There&#39;s a new girl who just started here recently too I think she&#39;s 
his sister.&quot; said Utena. &quot;She&#39;s in the fencing class.&quot;

 &quot;Ali Summura. She&#39;s pretty. Is she a duelist?&quot; asked Miki.

 &quot;I don&#39;t know. She&#39;s not part of the council.&quot; The young man looked 
directly at Miki and smiled, then put his hand on Kozue&#39;s cheek in a 
sweet but questionable gesture for one whom Kozue had just met then he 
walked away. Miki came over to her.

 &quot;Who was that?&quot; he said but pretended it was of little concern.

 &quot;His name is Gallian Vinsan.&quot; said Kozue. &quot;He&#39;s beautiful.&quot;

 Miki squinted. &quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;m going to get a taco, you 
coming?&quot;

 &quot;A taco? No, not today.&quot; Kozue walked away. Miki cocked his head to 
the side surprised by this response. He looked back over at the spot 
where Utena and Anthy had been standing but they were gone.

 Gillian moved down the hall. He was a little bigger than the other 
boys at the academy. A slender young man with green hair stepped out 
of the shadows and began to walk with him. &quot;So you&#39;re the new 
student.&quot; he said.

 &quot;Saionji Kyouichi?&quot; said Gallian Vinsan without looking his way.

 &quot;You know me.&quot;

 &quot;I&#39;ve heard mention of you. The green hair&#39;s a giveaway.&quot;

 &quot;And if you were to take that scarf off would your hair not -&quot; Before 
he could finish his sentence Gillian pulled the scarf from his head 
and medium length dreadlocks fell. They were the same light blue color 
as his school uniform. &quot;Stickler for school spirit eh. That&#39;s good for 
a duelist to have.&quot;

 &quot;Who says I&#39;m a duelist. I&#39;m just a black guy with blue dreads, 
walking around unnoticed in a private academy.&quot;

 &quot;Looks like Kozue noticed you.&quot;

 &quot;I noticed her.&quot;

 &quot;What&#39;s with that weird collar. It&#39;s like some kind of -&quot;

 &quot;Sailor. I&#39;ve heard &#39;em all before, okay.&quot;

 &quot;Well if you&#39;re not a duelist why are you here?&quot;

 &quot;My school exploded a few days ago.&quot;

 &quot;Exploded?&quot;

 &quot;Long story. I know Akio. He invited me to come here to Ohtori 
Academy. Actually I never really liked the guy. He was always kinda 
freaky to me. Either way this was my only alternative or go to a 
public school. I&#39;m glad I came though. Hey you know anything about 
this chick name C-ko? She&#39;s kinda hot. Got this little braid thing 
goin&#39; on. I met her coming out of an acting class.&quot;

 &quot;Never heard of her?&quot;

 &quot;Oh well. I should be going.&quot;

 &quot;Ah. I see where you mind is. A friend of mine wanted to meet you. 
With you being an associate of Akio&#39;s my friend figured you&#39;d be a 
great candidate for student council.&quot;

 &quot;I&#39;d be charmed I&#39;m sure. But you know, I&#39;m really busy right now, 
got a lot on my mind.&quot;

 &quot;Well this...friend -&quot;

 &quot;Touga.&quot;

 &quot;Yes. He wants to meet you today after school.&quot;

 &quot;Why?&quot;

 &quot;If you&#39;ve come to duel you&#39;ll need to know the rules. There&#39;s a 
special place where he, Akio and myself will show you the way.&quot;

 &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to go to any &#39;special places&#39; with the likes of 
you three. I&#39;ve met both of them. I think they&#39;re kind of into each 
other. And you don&#39;t make me feel comfortable yourself. Thanks but no 
thanks.&quot;

 &quot;How can you say that. Akio went away on vacation but he came back 
just to meet you in person. You really should be more grateful. He 
pulled the strings for you to get in here.&quot; Gillian paused. He caught 
a glimspe of Kozue as she crammed books into a locker but didn&#39;t see 
him walk by. When Gillian and Saionji got further along Gillian asked, 
&quot;What&#39;s your take on Kozue?&quot;

 &quot;You won&#39;t have any problems getting her if that&#39;s what you mean. But 
I don&#39;t see why a guy like you wouldn&#39;t set you sights higher. Utena. 
She pretty, even though she wears a boy&#39;s uniform.&quot;

 &quot;Red spandex shorts and a school jacket. I ain&#39;t seen no boys walking 
around in that. Not that  I&#39;m looking for any but it&#39;s just the fact 
of. I&#39;ve seenthat Utena chick. She&#39;s hot for a skinny girl. You know 
us brothers like a thicker woman.&quot;

 &quot;Ah, like your sister Ali Summura. I don&#39;t know, I think she&#39;s got a 
thing for Touga.&quot;

 &quot;My sister? That what she told you?&quot;

 &quot;Just guessing.&quot;

 The sword flew from Ali&#39;s hand as Jury landed a harsh blow. &quot;The 
problem is not your technique. You simply need to concentrate. Again.&quot;

 Ali Summura kicked her sword into the air, grabbed it and moved in. 
Her strikes appeared wild but were actually quick and controlled. Jury 
blocked most of her shots but some managed to get through. As the 
girls battled the fight managed to get very heated. The boys watched 
her intensely. Suddenly in the blink of an eye the fight was over. The 
two girls had managed to crack each other&#39;s practice blade. The crowd 
roared. As the deafening cheers lowered the sound of a single clap 
could be heard as Saionji walked through the hoarde of on lookers 
applauding. Gillian shook his head at the how hard the young women 
were battling.

 &quot;Pretty rough for a practice run don&#39;tcha think.&quot; asked Saionji.

 &quot;I&#39;m the best and I want my students to be.&quot;

 &quot;Wow, and to think she promised she&#39;d show me how to use my sword.&quot; 
said Gillian. Saionji chuckled.

 &quot;That I did.&quot; said Jury. &quot;Come down here.&quot;

 &quot;Oh I&#39;m no fighter.&quot;

 &quot;That&#39;s why you must learn.&quot;

 Gillian looked at Saionji who simply shrugged. He walked down to the 
ring and picked a sword. &quot;It&#39;s not what I&#39;m used to fighting with. My 
sword is usually - bigger.&quot; Jury&#39;s expression went blank and she took 
her stance. With the agility of a cat she struck. Gillian surprised 
himself by blocking her moves almost instinctively. But because he 
used heavier swords there were points in which he over or 
underestimated and it cost him as Jury&#39;s sword whipped across him 
several times. Finally her wooden sword struck his chest.

 &quot;Had this been a real fight I would&#39;ve cut your heart out.&quot; she 
slapped him hard causing his body to nearly fly across the arena. 
Saionji noticed the impressive move and nodded with approval.   
&quot;That&#39;s for being fresh.&quot; she said. The girl&#39;s were stunned at how 
she&#39;d handled this new student.

 He climbed to his feet and noticed Ali laughing quietly. &quot;Very well.&quot; 
he said. &quot;Consider me punished.&quot;

 &quot;I think he likes being punished.&quot; said Ali.

 Gillian frowned. &quot;That&#39;s enough out of you, sister.&quot; he said. Ali 
smiled.

 Soon night fell and Utena found herself once again in the den of the 
lion known as Akio.   &quot;He&#39;s strange.&quot; said Utena. Akio sat on the 
couch and sipped wine from a crystal glass as he listened intently. 
Anthy stood by the window and seemed to assume nothing. &quot;He seems 
friendly enough.&quot; continued Utena.

 &quot;Atleast he got very friendly with Miki&#39;s sister. My best friend 
Wakaba mentioned to me that he said some things to her that were a bit 
cheeky for a man she&#39;d just met. We may have another Touga on our 
hands.&quot;

 &quot;Please understand Gillian means no harm. He has good heart and he 
like to be friendly with women.&quot;

 &quot;Friendly.&quot;

 &quot;He&#39;s not a seducer.&quot;

 &quot;And what about the new girl on the fencing team?&quot;

 &quot;Ali Summura? His sister.&quot;

 &quot;She doesn&#39;t like to talk to people.&quot;

 &quot;Not everyone is a talker now are they. Don&#39;t worry about any of 
this. You&#39;ll get old before your time and we wouldn&#39;t want that would 
we.&quot;

 Utena blushed. &quot;I have go to bed.&quot; she said.

 &quot;I hate it when you leave. We&#39;ve grown so close. You&#39;re like another 
sister to me. Anthy is my only living blood.&quot;

 &quot;Well, thank you, but I do have to wake up early.&quot;

 Utena walked toward the stairs. Anthy smiled. Utena nodded knowing 
Anthy wanted to spend time with her brother. Utena headed upstairs. 
Akio walked over to Anthy and hugged her from behind. &quot;There&#39;s nothing 
like the time a brother and sister share. Anthy smiled as the lights 
went out.

 Gillian, garbed in leather pants, combat boots a leather trench 
walked through the halls. He had washed the blue spray in color from 
his hair and wanted only to get something to eat. He heard movement 
behind him and turned to see who it was, but no one was there. He went 
a few paces but there it was again. He gave nothing the chance. He ran 
spun and flung his bag behind him then jumped into an open class room. 
He smacked the activation button on his wrist band and moved back into 
the hallway swiftly. A shadow appeared near the door and he turned to 
fire.

 &quot;So dramatic.&quot; he heard Touga say. &quot;And exactly what are you going to 
do? You could&#39;ve never hit me from way back there unless you had some 
kind of projectile weapon.&quot;

 If he only knew, thought Gillian as he deactivated the emmulator. 
&quot;What could you possibly want.&quot;

 &quot;I want to invite you to bid for the power to bring the world 
revolution. I would like to take you to a special place.&quot;

 &quot;Where you can be my special friend? I don&#39;t think so.&quot;

 Touga was slightly amused. He extended his arms. &quot;If your heart 
hasn&#39;t given up completely, you can hear this sound, running about the 
end of the world.&quot;

 &quot;What? Man what the hell are you talking about?&quot; Suddenly the sound 
of a harsh revving motor could be heard. He turned as Akio drove up in 
a shinny red drop-top sports car with Ali in the back seat. &quot;Get in.&quot; 
said Akio.

 &quot;Dude, how&#39;d you get your car in here.&quot;

 &quot;That&#39;s not a concern now.&quot;

 &quot;Dude, we&#39;re five floors up.&quot;

 &quot;It will all make sense soon.&quot; said Ali. Touga stroked the car 
lovingly then climbed in with her. They raced down the street. As 
Touga and Ali fondled each other in the back seat Gillian spoke with 
Akio. &quot;Would someone please tell me what this is all about.&quot;

 &quot;Making your fondest dreams come true.&quot;

 &quot;How so?&quot;

 &quot;With the power to make miracles the world is yours. You can be 
anything you want. Even a Sailor Scout.&quot;

 Gillian frowned. &quot;Really? Why would I want to do something like that? 
Besides, what do you know about the Sailor Scouts?&quot;

 &quot;I know you&#39;re here for a purpose. Your school didn&#39;t burn down or 
explode or whatever. You never attended Ozawa Academy. The attendence 
documents you forged were nice though. So I can only figure you had a 
plan. It&#39;s easier to get into another school when yours explodes in 
the middle of the night isn&#39;t it?&quot; Akio smiled. Gillian didn&#39;t like 
the sound of what Akio may have been implying.

 &quot;Think about this Gillian. What do you really want?&quot; asked Ali then 
she kissed Touga&#39;s chest and ran her tongue over the nipple.

 &quot;Okay.&quot; said Gillian. &quot;I&#39;ll listen to your pitch, but no foot 
massaging and no touching... me that is.&quot;

 &quot;Oh he&#39;s a pepper.&quot; said Touga.

 Akio smirked. &quot;The ends of the world I will show to you.&quot; he said as 
he flipped out of the car onto the hood and landed on his knees then 
sat back and rode as his shirt flapping in the wind.

 &quot;What the?&quot; Gillian moved to grab the wheel. Ali reached up to the 
front seat took his hand and whispered in his ear. &quot;You don&#39;t want to 
touch the car. You know how Touga touches this car.&quot;

 &quot;Ewww.&quot; said Gillian.

 &quot;Don&#39;t knock it.&quot; said Touga as he took the black rose signet ring 
Ali wore around her neck off and slid his hand up Ali&#39;s back and undid 
her bra. The car drove on. Gillian shook his head.

 The next morning Gillian found Utena in the lunchroom.

 &quot;So you&#39;re Utena.&quot; he said as he sat down by her.

 She looked up from the book she was reading. &quot;You&#39;re the new boy, 
Gillian.&quot; She extended her hand. He took it and kissed it.

 &quot;Gillian Vinsan. I was hoping I&#39;d meet you. There&#39;s some things that 
have to happen. Things that will make you mad, but understand they&#39;ll 
happen for a reason.&quot;

 &quot;What? I don&#39;t know what that means. I don&#39;t even know you.&quot;

 &quot;Oh you will.&quot; He walked away in an overly dramatic move turned and 
flung a rose sealed envelope at her like a ninja would a combat star. 
She didn&#39;t even open it.

 &quot;You too?&quot;

 &quot;A prince is one who rules. Will you rule?&#39;

 &quot;You speak in riddles.&quot;

 &quot;You should be used to it by now.&quot; Gillian put on a pair of shades. 
Even though they were inside a sudden wind seemed to rise from nowhere 
and whip his coat tail. Miki watched from the landing above and met 
Gillian on the stairs.

 &quot;Even if you win I won&#39;t let you have her. She deserves her freedom.&quot; 
he said.

 &quot;So you can date her? Okay. If I win she&#39;s yours, although you&#39;ll 
have to go through the proper procedures to get her. We&#39;ll test your 
love for her. But seeing that you don&#39;t have her now, I take it you&#39;ve 
failed before?&quot;

 Miki looked down. &quot;I want you to stay away from my sister.&quot;

 &quot;The blue haired chick? She&#39;s a cutie. I&#39;ll make a deal. If you win 
The Rose Bride from me. I&#39;ll leave your sister alone and leave this 
hellhole of academy. Hey, you do know the student council is a cult 
right? And I&#39;m sure that if I looked closely I&#39;d find evidence of 
statutory rape and ritual abuse. But I&#39;m not going to do that. You&#39;ll 
figure the rest out on your own or you&#39;ll keep swallowing the garbage 
Akio and Touga ram down your throat.&quot;

 Miki&#39;s face went red with anger. &quot;Seems like a lot of people are 
swallowing that same garbage.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

 The day passed quickly for Utena. She informed Anthy of the duel and 
they prepared. &quot;He&#39;s quick but his skills aren&#39;t nearly up to par with 
the other duelist.&quot; she said. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Utena. This will all be 
over very soon.&quot; said Anthy as they walked onto the lift.

 Anthy disappeared suddenly and reappeared as The Rose Bride. They 
rode the elevator to the arena. Gillian and Ali where in Akio&#39;s car. 
The drove in, parked got out and waited by the car.Gillian sniffed a 
rose and put it on his lapel. Utena&#39;s was already affixed. She shook 
her head.

 &quot;Why do you want to go through with this? You not even student 
Council. Who are you?&quot;

 &quot;It&#39;s the only way I can get my mack on with a hottie like The Rose 
Bride. Isn&#39;t that reason enough?&quot;

 Utena wasn&#39;t amused. &quot;There has to be more to it than that.&quot;

 &quot;Does there?&quot;

 Utena didn&#39;t want to waste any more time with his foolish 
conversation. Anthy leaned Utena over her arm and began to pull a long 
blade from her chest. &quot;Rose of the Noble Castle. Power of Dios sleeps 
within me. Heed your master and come forth. Grant me the power to 
bring the world revolution!&quot; said Utena.

 Gillian turned to Ali. &quot;That&#39;s not good. You&#39;re gonna do that to me?&quot; 
he said.

 &quot;Say the words.&quot; Ali replied.

 She rubbed her hands together with glee and grinned wickedly. Gillian 
raised a brow. Ali dipped him back. &quot;Sword of Fantasy, to my hand at 
my command! Rage of the Justice Bringers Grant me the power to bring 
wraith.&quot; shouted Gillian as Ali pulled a huge sword from his chest.

 Utena&#39;s eye became wide. &quot;It&#39;s so big he surely can&#39;t maneuver with 
it.&quot; she thought as she took in the sight of the huge weapon. Suddenly 
church bells went off all around them. She moved to attack. Gillian 
blocked the strike quickly. Utena slashed at him but he dodged. He 
lunged but she moved to the side. His sword was hard to block because 
of it&#39;s size, but it slowed him down enough making it easier to dodge. 
Utena was no joke. She wasn&#39;t the greatest fencer in the world but she 
moved like a cheetah. He would have to get her into position fast. He 
glanced over at Ali who was driving around the areana. She was 
supposed to keep an eye on Anthy, but her attention was on Touga. She 
looked upward longingly and tried to see him as he tried to stay out 
of sight but could see her through his binoculars. &quot;Okay, so I&#39;m truly 
alone in this this.&quot; Thought Gillian. Suddenly he became confused 
Anthy and Ali started to look alike. &quot;What?&quot; he said. &quot;Ali... what?&quot; 
He noticed Utena right on him and fell back to stay clear. She landed 
on top of him. &quot;And I thought you didn&#39;t like me.&quot; he said.

 She rolled off quickly and slashed at him. He lifted his sword but 
was cut on the arm. Gillian looked down. &quot;Y-you drew blood?&quot; The 
ground began to shake. Cars, all modeled after Akio&#39;s red sports car, 
rose from the ground, one jutted up right behind him and caused him to 
lose balance for a second.

 &quot;This is dangerous sport even when you&#39;re not in a real duel. You 
have some nerve. You should just leave. It&#39;s okay to give up.&quot; said 
Utena.

 &quot;But I won&#39;t lose.&quot; he said smiling. He knew the confusion was 
magically induced and would destroy him but he had to be okay. It was 
time. If his attack failed he knew this agile girl would either take 
the rose from his chest or as he feared most, run him through. He was 
unclear about her intentions or her nature. Though she seemed 
personable she was quite fearless with that sword in her hand. He 
charged her and swung for her midsection. Utena instinctively jumped 
into the air. A high powered rush of air could be heard. Then Utena 
landed in a stance ready for more, but then she paused. &quot;W-what did 
you do to me?&quot; she mumbled then felt a burning in her leg. A dart. She 
looked at his sword.

 &quot;Your sword.&quot;

 &quot;It&#39;s called the Sword of Fantasy. Some call it a gun-sword. I&#39;ve 
heard that if I struck at your midsection you&#39;d jump. I wasn&#39;t 
expecting a ten foot vertical and a fifty foot horizontal leap but 
whatever. I needed my dart to strike you as you landed.&quot;

 &quot;You cheated.&quot;

 &quot;No I didn&#39;t. The rules say I need a sword. They didn&#39;t specify. It 
was your choice to use the fencing swords. It&#39;s what all of you know. 
I&#39;ve never fenced, atleast not well. You should be falling right about 
now.&quot;

 Utena gritted her teeth and leapt at him but fell to the arena floor. 
Anthy&#39;s face froze with a look of shock as Gillian walked over and 
slashed the rose from her lapel. Every car around them sent 
luminations into the sky from their headlights. Gillian could hear a 
ringing of bells again in the distance. &quot;Get Utena in the car.&quot; said 
Gillian.

 Ali smiled and put Utena in the back seat. He nodded to Anthy. She 
walked over to him. He took her hand and led her into the front seat 
with him. Gillian got in the car and drove off.

 &quot;Can&#39;t we wait for Touga.&quot; said Ali.

 &quot;I&#39;m taking them both to my place until Utena wakes up. I don&#39;t trust 
Touga nor Akio. Something about them rubs me the wrong way.&quot;

 &quot;Oh, that&#39;s so sweet of you to drug her and then make sure she&#39;s 
protected.&quot;

 &quot;Like you protected me from Anthy?&quot; he said stroking Anthy&#39;s cheek. 
&quot;I know about you.&quot;

 &quot;Suppose they try to stop us.&quot;

 &quot;I got enough fire power to light up a football field.&quot;

 &quot;The band?&quot;

 &quot;Yep. It&#39;s like having Sailor Mars on my wrist as far as I&#39;m 
concerned.&quot; The metallic wrist band hummed when he said this.

 Akio and Touga looked down on this through binoculars. &quot;He did it.&quot; 
said a stunned Akio.

 &quot;Yes he did.&quot; said Touga. &quot;Are we going to let this victory stand?&quot;

 &quot;For now, until we better understand his motives.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

 A few days passed. Utena felt like Anthy was nothing more than a 
trophy to Gillian. He had been trotting around with her in tow. It was 
like he was showing her off. This had happened before. She tried not 
to let it get her down but soon the depression sunk in. She woke early 
from force of habit but didn&#39;t go to class and didn&#39;t eat. Instead she 
went up to one of the bedrooms on the top floor and stayed there all 
day.

 Later that night there was a rapping at the door. She didn&#39;t move. 
After a few moments it stopped. Then she felt a rush of cold air. She 
looked up as Gillian came down from the sky light and landed on top of 
her.

 &quot;Get off!&quot; she said pushing him to the ground. She was strong of will 
more than strength but it did the job. Gillian smiled.

 &quot;You weren&#39;t in class today?&quot;

 &quot;I can&#39;t believe you came here to rub it in.&quot;

 &quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot;

 &quot;Then why are you here Gillian? If that&#39;s your real name. I&#39;ll call 
you cheater.&quot;

 Gillian stood to his feet. &quot;Like you two don&#39;t cheat. Touga told me 
you were an ametuer fencer yet you consistently kicked the butts of 
people who&#39;ve trained for years and you want me to believe it&#39;s all on 
the up and up? I don&#39;t think so. You&#39;ll get Anthy back no doubt.&quot;

 &quot;Who are you? Akio says you&#39;re called &#39;The Space Pirate&#39;, whatever 
that means.&quot;

 &quot;It&#39;s a bad translation. You know, like when you get fan dubs of old 
Japanese cartoons but the dubbers are lazy and they leave out words 
and sometimes whole phrases. I&#39;m called Space Pirate Gillian, but most 
people know me as Gillian Vinsan. My actual handle is Super Soldier 
Pirate Moon.&quot;

 &quot;And that&#39;s better than the bad translation?&quot;

 Gillian sneered. &quot;Oh, you got jokes. That&#39;s why Athny&#39;s at my house 
now.&quot; Utena moved to punch him. He moved back instinctively and 
grabbed her fist. &quot;Hey, take it easy. It&#39;s a joke. Miki&#39;s set to 
challenge me next. He&#39;ll win her, for a minute. Declare his love or 
whatever and then you&#39;ll easily win her back when you defeat him.&quot;

 &quot;And you&#39;re so sure I&#39;ll defeat Miki?&quot;

 &quot;You would&#39;ve defeated me. That&#39;s why I played it smart. I&#39;m a pirate 
kid, sometimes I fight dirty.&quot;

 Utena sat back on the bed. &quot;So you want to be a prince.&quot; he said.

 &quot;Who&#39;ve you been talking to?&quot;

 &quot;The people who know you best. It&#39;s not awful. I want to be a Sailor 
Scout. If only the roles were reversed.&quot;

 &quot;But they&#39;re not. Are you trying to imply that we&#39;re somehow 
soulmates.&quot; Utena leaped on him and began to strike him with her fist. 
He flung her to the bed and pinned her down.

 &quot;Take a shower and put on your day clothes. You&#39;re not eating. We&#39;re 
going to get some food in you, goodness knows you&#39;re skinny enough. 
Then and only then I&#39;ll take you to see Anthy. She&#39;s under my 
protection.&quot; Gillian got up.

 &quot;Y-your protection.&quot;

 &quot;It&#39;s a long story. Do you know what a SOD is?&quot;

 Utena thought for a moment. &quot;No.&quot;

 &quot;A Sister Of Deception. Her name is Prizma. I know little about Anthy
