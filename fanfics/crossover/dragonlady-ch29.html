&quot;Hey, Akane,&quot; Ranma greeted as Akane walked up.

&quot;Hey, Mom,&quot; Akane said brightly.

&quot;You seem awfully cheerful,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;Happy to have Nabs here?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah, but that&#39;s not why I&#39;m so happy,&quot; Akane grinned.

&quot;Do tell,&quot; Ranma asked, glad that her friend was so happy.

&quot;I think I may have found the One,&quot; Akane broke back into a huge 
ecstatic smile.

&quot;Really?&quot; Ranma asked, excited for Akane. &quot;Who&#39;s the lucky girl? Tell me 
all about her. You know you wanna.&quot; Ranma giggled.

&quot;It&#39;s Azonia,&quot; Akane said happily. &quot;We&#39;ve been getting really close. We 
started dating while you and Lisa were in China. Our last date she even 
asked if she could &#39;press lips&#39; with me.&quot; Ranma laughed.

&quot;I&#39;m glad for you,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Azonia seems like a fantastic match for 
you. Just be careful with her. She&#39;s still pretty new to the whole 
emotional thing. You don&#39;t want to scare her off.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Akane said. &quot;I&#39;m letting her take it at her pace, letting her 
know I&#39;m willing to go as far as she wants. She&#39;s actually a really good 
kisser.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m really, really happy for you,&quot; Ranma said, hugging her. &quot;You&#39;re one 
of my best friends and you deserve to be happy.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;We have to do something about Alaska Base, Admiral,&quot; Lisa insisted. &quot;My 
father and his thugs can&#39;t be allowed to continue unchecked. Intel 
indicates that they are trying to repair the Grand Cannon. If they do 
then they will be a threat to all orbital shipping. And I doubt they 
will stop there.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Gloval said. &quot;So what do you propose?&quot;

&quot;Ranma and I have been working on a plan to go in and clean them out,&quot; 
Lisa explained. &quot;Orbital surveillance suggests they have a force of 
about 60 Veritechs and a division of destroids. The plan we came up with 
was to soften them up with an orbital bombardment, taking out the 
runways and any units currently on the ground. The next phase would be 
to go in with four squadrons of Veritechs, Wild Rose, Skull, and two 
others, and take out any remaining mechanized resistance. Once the 
surface is secure, we bring in a platoon of Marine commandos to go in 
and clear the underground facility room by room.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m assuming that Captain Saotome-Hayes would be leading this 
operation?&quot; Gloval remarked.

&quot;No, Sir,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I would be. He&#39;s my father. Maybe he&#39;ll listen to 
reason if I was there.&quot;

&quot;But Lisa,&quot; Gloval protested. &quot;You&#39;re not trained to be involved in a 
ground assault.&quot;

&quot;I can pull a trigger as well as the next person,&quot; Lisa disagreed. &quot;And 
Ranma has been teaching me her art for some time now. I&#39;m nowhere near 
her level, or that of her advanced students, but I can hold my own 
against the average soldier. Besides, Ranma will be with me. She won&#39;t 
let anything happen to me if she can help it.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Gloval conceded. &quot;You have my approval to mount the 
operation. Let me know when you have the details worked out and have set 
a time table.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir,&quot; Lisa said.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Orbital Laser Bombardment complete, Ma&#39;am,&quot; reported the Zentradi 
commander.

&quot;Thank you, Commander,&quot; Lisa acknowledged. &quot;Ranma, we&#39;re go for phase 
2.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Lisa,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Okay, boys and girls, this is it. We&#39;re 
going in. It&#39;s libel to get ugly in there so watch each other&#39;s six.&quot;

Ranma turned toward the target and led the 48 plane assault force in. As 
she approached the site, she saw that it was leveled and pockmarked with 
smoking craters. Nothing appeared to be moving. That quickly changed 
though once her Veritechs began to touch down.

Defenders began to boil out from underground entrances and soon they 
were in a massive firefight. Ranma and her flight cut through them like 
a scythe through wheat. The defending forces couldn&#39;t even begin to 
understand what they were up against. Even the non-Wild Rose squadrons 
were battled hardened and very experienced Veritech pilots. The 
defenders, while many and having a lot of hours, where unused to the 
surrealism of a pitched battle.

Still, there were many of them. Ranma fired a round from her heavy beam 
cannon at a Tomahawk that was trying to flank another member of her 
team. The heavy destroid toppled as the drive unit for its legs was 
gutted by Ranma&#39;s fire.

Then she had to throw herself to the side as a defending Veritech 
strafed the space she was standing in a moment before. It skated in on 
her, in guardian mode, and was gutted by Akane.

&quot;Thanks, Fury,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;No problem, Mom,&quot; Akane laughed.

Ranma quickly got to her feet and launched her missiles at a large 
formation of enemy mecha. The formation broke up as the missiles rained 
in around them. Charging in, Ranma took out several Defender and Phalanx 
model destroids with her beam cannons, trusting Akane to keep them from 
flanking her. Then she engaged two enemy Veritechs at once. She managed 
to destroy one&#39;s gun pod with her right beam cannon and blew the other 
ones left leg off with her left cannon. She finished it with her head 
lasers as it fell. Dodging the return laser fire from the other 
Veritech, she took out its head with another cannon shot.

Then she and Akane came under fire from a pair of Monster class 
destroids. They both took desperate evasive measures trying to avoid the 
withering fire. Before they could get a shot off at the two fire support 
mecha, the Monsters blew up. Two armored Veritechs streaked by overhead, 
having just destroyed the two problem mecha.

Max and Miriya were once again operating in perfect sync as they sliced 
through defenders. By the time it was over the pair had accounted for 
the most destroyed enemy mecha of the assault team. The other members of 
Wild Rose Squadron also proved why they were the elite squadron of the 
SDF-1. Once again, the twelve mecha accounted for the bulk of the enemy 
losses.

Faced with this unimaginable onslaught, seeing their 80+ mecha cut down 
around them, the last twenty surrendered. They climbed down from their 
mecha and were herded into a crater with two Armored Veritechs set to 
guard them. Ranma had the remaining units set up a defensive perimeter. 
Once that was done, she called in phase three.

&quot;Chimneysweep, this is Clean Sweep, perimeter secure,&quot; she called over 
the comm. &quot;You&#39;re clear to approach.&quot;

&quot;Roger, Clean Sweep, we&#39;re on our way,&quot; a man acknowledged.

About twenty minutes later, Ranma heard the thumping of rotor blades as 
the transport helos came in. Ranma and Akane had already shut down their 
Veritechs and climbed out as the helos set down. They took off toward 
the lead helo even as its doors opened and Marines poured out, setting 
up a perimeter.

Ranma and Akane leaped aboard the helo and began to remove their flight 
suits and put on winter camo BDU&#39;s and body armor. They put in earpieces 
and adjusted their boom mics before doing a fast radio check. After 
strapping on pistols, they grabbed their rifles and joined the others.

&quot;You ready for this?&quot; Lisa asked them.

The pair nodded. Ranma hung close by Lisa while Akane sidled over to 
Azonia as Lisa gave the order to enter the underground facility. The 
platoon of Marine commandos entered the facility through a destroyed 
mecha hanger door. It was deserted, but the large steel door at the end 
of the room was locked tight. The Marines blew the door and they quickly 
entered the corridor.

They made their way down the corridor and after a brief but intense 
firefight they cleared the resistance from the stairway. As they came to 
the first sublevel, two squads were sent in to clear it. The rest 
proceeded down to the next level. And so it went. As each level was 
cleared, the Marines would mine the elevator doors to prevent anyone 
from slipping back behind them and proceeded down to the next level 
beyond. Two squads remained in the stairwell at all times to prevent 
anyone from coming up at them.

They largely encountered very little resistance on the uppermost levels, 
but as they got deeper in, the resistance got stiffer. Any prisoners 
they captured were taken up to the Mecha hanger and guarded by Max and 
Miriya. Distressingly, not many prisoners were taken. The defenders had 
obviously decided to hold out to the end.

Ranma placed her hand on the doorknob that intel indicated lead into the 
Command Center. She paused, having an ill feeling. Removing her hand, 
she backed away from the door.

&quot;Sergeant Rinkin, get up here,&quot; Ranma whispered into her mic.

The Marine in question moved up beside her. &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; he asked.

&quot;I think this door is rigged,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Check it out.&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am,&quot; Rinkin said removing a drill from his pack.

He drilled a hole through the wall beside the door and put the drill 
away. Taking out a small LCD monitor with a cable and some controls 
attached, he passed the cable into the hole and watched the monitor. 
Slowly he manipulated the controls. The view first showed a view of the 
corridor beyond the door. It wasn&#146;t good. At the end of it was a 
sandbagged gun emplacement. It appeared to have a .50 caliber BMG along 
with several men with rifles waiting for them.

Rinkin moved the view to the door. Also not good. There was a claymore 
mine sitting about a foot away in front of the door. The triggering 
device was attached to the door. Any move to open it would result in the 
detonation of the mine.

&quot;Everybody, pull back up to the next level,&quot; Ranma ordered.

They moved back up and Lisa, Ranma, Akane, Azonia and the Marine 
commander, Major Kudrow put their heads together.

&quot;Okay, this is what we have,&quot; Ranma briefed. &quot;They have the door mined. 
Any move to open the door and the mine goes off. I could open the door. 
With my Bauksai Tenketsu training and my ki shielding technique, I could 
probably survive the explosion.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Lisa said narrowing her eyes, &quot;probably?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;ve never tested them out by detonating a mine in front of 
me,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;So, yeah, probably.&quot;

&quot;Not good enough,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I&#39;m not letting you take that chance.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a moot point anyway,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Even if I did survive the 
explosion and shrapnel, after that, there&#39;s about a 30 meters of 
straight corridor with a heavy machine gun and a company of men with 
rifles in a fortified position at the end of it. It&#39;d be a killing 
field.&quot;

&quot;What if we blow the door remotely,&quot; Kudrow suggested. &quot;That would set 
off the mine harmlessly. Then we could launch a couple of 40mm grenades 
down the corridor to take out the gun position.&quot;

&quot;That would cost us some people,&quot; Akane said. &quot;They&#39;d have to be in the 
line of fire to launch the grenades and you can bet with that kind of 
firepower, they&#39;d be laying it on thick.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s time we negotiated,&quot; Lisa suggested. Her eyes grew harder 
than Ranma had ever seen them. &quot;We really don&#39;t need to take them into 
custody to remove them as a threat.&quot; The others shuddered at the chilly 
tone in her voice.

(oO\O/Oo)

The remains of the Joint Chiefs sat in a conference room wearing full 
combat gear. Tension was running high as they waited. They had tracked 
the progress of the enemy as they moved methodically from level to 
level, taking out the men defending each level and then the security 
cameras. They knew it was only a matter of time before they assaulted 
this level. Grips were tightened on weapons as they each prepared to 
fight to repel the attack.

&quot;Admiral Hayes, I&#39;m getting a signal,&quot; one of the comm techs said.

&quot;Ignore it like we have all the others,&quot; Hayes said grimly.

&quot;Sir, it&#39;s your daughter,&quot; the tech said. Hayes sighed.

&quot;Very well, let&#39;s hear what the traitorous little dyke has to say,&quot; 
Hayes snarled. &quot;Put it on the screen.&quot;

&quot;This is Captain Lisa Saotome-Hayes of the RDF,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I&#39;m giving 
you this last chance to surrender peacefully. There&#39;s no way out for 
you.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll never surrender,&quot; Hayes said. &quot;You have to come in and get us. 
We&#39;ll fight to the last breath against the unlawful alien allied forces 
taking over the planet.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t seem to understand, Father,&quot; Lisa sneered. &quot;We don&#39;t HAVE to 
come in and get you. You are no longer a threat. All we HAVE to do is 
wait you out. You&#39;re trapped. Now you can either gather the scraps of 
what tattered honor you have left to you and face the charges against 
you with dignity, or you can die like rats in your dark little hole. We 
can, and will make this place your prison. Don&#39;t push me or I&#39;ll blow 
the whole facility on top of you and bury you in there for the rest of 
your despicable lives.&quot;

Donald Hayes was taken aback by the intensity of his daughter&#39;s rancor. 
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t dare,&quot; he said.

&quot;You hateful, xenophobic idiots cost the lives of half the people on 
this planet, on the very cusp of a peaceful end to the hostilities,&quot; 
Lisa snarled. &quot;You sent over 50 thousand civilians into what you 
presumed would be their deaths because you didn&#39;t want to get caught in 
a dirty little lie. You fired on the Zentradi during an honorably agreed 
to cease-fire. Your self-serving lack of honor knows no bounds. Do not 
presume to tell me what I would dare do. You are little better than 
pirates. Nobody would question me if I sealed you in the tomb of your 
choosing.&quot;

&quot;Betraying witch,&quot; Hayes growled. &quot;You&#39;re a traitor to the Earth!&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s a traitor to the Earth?&quot; Lisa asked. &quot;The people responsible for 
the deaths of half the population, or the people who managed to save the 
other half? All you can do is sit in your dark little hole and hatch 
schemes to put you back into power. Enough is enough. I demand your 
immediate surrender. Lay down your weapons and face justice or let this 
be your tomb. That&#39;s your choice.&quot;

After about a half an hour of deliberation, Hayes called back.

&quot;Okay, we&#39;re coming up,&quot; he told his daughter.

&quot;I want you and the other brass up here first. Use the stairwell,&quot; Lisa 
told him. &quot;The elevator would be...unhealthy.&quot;

&#39;When did my warm happy little girl become so cold and angry?&#39; Hayes 
caught himself wondering.

(oO\O/Oo)

Lisa looked over the 60 men who knelt on the floor with their hands 
behind their head. The Marines were stationed at various places 
throughout the room covering them.

&quot;Is this all of you?&quot; Lisa asked Hayes.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the older man said somewhat shortly.

&quot;It had better be,&quot; Lisa said grimly. &quot;Major Kudrow, I want a company to 
go down and clear the last three levels and the rest to begin escorting 
prisoners to the surface. 10 prisoners to a squad leaving five minutes 
apart.&quot;

&quot;Yes Ma&#39;am,&quot; Kudrow saluted. &quot;Aright, Parker, take your company and make 
sure things are clear. Atkins, start escorting the prisoners up.&quot;

&quot;Sir!&quot; the men acknowledged.

A twenty minutes later only the former Joint Chiefs and a few of their 
staff were left.

&quot;We&#39;ll take these up, Major,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;You and the others stay here 
in case the clearing team needs backup.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Kudrow acknowledged.

Lisa and Ranma took the lead and Akane and Azonia fell in behind the 
prisoners as they were herded up the stairwell. They had made it about 
three floors up when a muffled explosion shook the complex. Lisa was 
immediately on the comm demanding to know what happened. The remaining 
Marines sent to clear the last three levels reported there had been a 
booby-trap.

Unfortunately, Hayes used the distraction to grab her and take her 
sidearm. He held Lisa in front of him as a shield and pointed the gun at 
Ranma as she turned around to see what the commotion was. Her rifle was 
off her shoulder faster than anyone&#39;s eye could follow and Hayes found 
himself looking down the bore. Everyone was frozen as the tableau held.

&quot;Lisa, drop your rifle or I shoot her,&quot; Hayes said coolly. Lisa&#39;s rifle 
clattered to the floor and one of his cronies quickly picked it up. 
&quot;Good, now tell them to put down their weapons.&quot;

&quot;Lisa, don&#39;t do it,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;He can&#39;t hurt me. Remember the Bauksai 
Tenketsu and the barrier. He can&#39;t hurt me.&quot; Lisa noticed a faint silver 
shimmer in the air around Ranma.

&quot;Hurt you?&quot; Hayes scoffed. &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you, freak, for turning my 
daughter against me.&quot;

&quot;Father, your own dishonorable behavior turned me against you,&quot; Lisa 
hissed. &quot;Don&#39;t even think about blaming Ranma for that. It was all your 
doing.&quot;

&quot;Tell them to put down their weapons,&quot; Hayes ordered again. His crony 
positioned himself to cover Akane and Azonia.

&quot;Lisa, he&#39;s your father so it&#39;s your choice,&quot; Ranma said, the bore of 
her rifle rock steady on Hayes&#39; eye. &quot;Does the bastard live or die. I 
can take him out right now with a clean headshot, or I can take the gun 
from him and shove it up his ass sideways. Which do you prefer?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not joking here,&quot; Hayes hissed. &quot;Give the order or I shoot her.&quot;

&quot;If he shoots, execute them all,&quot; Lisa said.

Then the fecal matter hit the rotary air-moving device. One of the 
unarmed men took a step toward Akane. She jerked her muzzle toward him 
to make him think twice about it and the man with the rifle freaked out. 
He jerked his aim toward Akane and fired.

&quot;No!&quot; Azonia screamed and shoulder blocked Akane to the side. The burst 
of rifle fire tore into Azonia&#39;s arm and shoulder sending her spinning 
to the floor in a spray of blood.

At the same time, Ranma shifted her aim and ripped a burst into the man, 
killing him. Hayes saw his opening and fired the pistol at Ranma...with 
no effect. The bullets seemed to slow to nearly a halt in a flash of 
silver light as they neared the redhead. Hayes was so stunned he didn&#39;t 
know what hit him when Lisa grabbed his arm and tossed him over her 
shoulder into the wall.

At that moment, a burst of fire sounded from behind. The remaining 
unarmed men had attempted to bum rush Akane as she was stunned from the 
shoulder block and Azonia taking the hits for her. Akane&#39;s training held 
though. She opened fire on them, killing three and wounding the other 
five.

Ranma had Hayes in a wristlock with her foot on his neck and the bore of 
her rifle to his temple.

&quot;Put the gun down,&quot; Ranma growled at the man.

&quot;Go to hell,&quot; Hayes snarled and tried to bring the gun up.

&quot;You first,&quot; Ranma said, pulling the trigger.

Akane rushed to Azonia&#39;s side.

&quot;Why?&quot; Akane asked softly. &quot;Why did you take those rounds for me?&quot;

&quot;Because...&quot; Azonia said through her grimace of pain, &quot;I 
now...understand what...Miriya feels...for Max. Your life...has 
become...more important to me...than my own.&quot;

Akane let out a half laugh, half sob and leaned down to kiss Azonia 
tenderly.

&quot;I love you too,&quot; Akane whispered to her, causing Azonia to produce a 
small smile.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Are you alright, Love,&quot; Ranma asked, stepping up beside Lisa as she 
watched the prisoners and wounded being loaded into the transport helos.

&quot;Oh Ranma,&quot; Lisa said, hugging the smaller woman to her tightly. &quot;Why 
did he become such an evil, hateful bastard?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ranma said, stroking her back as Lisa began to cry. &quot;I&#39;m 
really, really sorry, Love.&quot;

&quot;You have nothing to be sorry for,&quot; Lisa said, holding her tighter.

&quot;I...I...executed him,&quot; Ranma said softly.

&quot;If you hadn&#39;t I would have, Love,&quot; Lisa said darkly. &quot;He tried to kill 
you. He tried to kill our family. He was responsible for the deaths of 
millions. He deserved what he got. We gave him a chance, but he threw it 
in our face. Please don&#39;t feel guilty over what he forced you to do.&quot;

&quot;I know, Lisa,&quot; Ranma said, her own tears starting to flow. &quot;I&#39;m just 
scared of what I&#39;m becoming. First Dolza, then you father. Am I becoming 
a ruthless assassin? An executioner? I don&#39;t think I can live with 
that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s over now, my Love,&quot; Lisa whispered to her. &quot;There&#39;s no more need 
for killing. Don&#39;t worry, Sweetie, we&#39;ll keep each other from becoming 
cynical and jaded. Let&#39;s just try to put this ugliness behind us, okay?&quot; 
Ranma nodded into her shoulder. Lisa looked over to see the transports 
taking off. &quot;Come on, Love, let&#39;s go home. Maybe we should both talk to 
Dr. Koenig when we get back.&quot;

&quot;You sure you can handle a Veritech?&quot; Ranma asked her.

&quot;I&#39;m qualified,&quot; Lisa assured her. &quot;I may not be as good as you guys, 
but it&#39;s just a short flight to Denver. It&#39;s not like I&#39;ll be flying 
combat or anything.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll be right beside you the whole way though.&quot;

&quot;Worry wart,&quot; Lisa accused as she climbed into the cockpit of Wild Rose 
2.

Akane had chosen to ride on the transport with Azonia, so Lisa was 
flying her plane back. Ranma chuckled and climbed into Wild Rose 1.

As the RDF forces left the area, Ranma sent a signal. High up in orbit, 
a Zentradi cruiser launched a single nuke. The missile traveled down 
through the atmosphere and plunged straight down the barrel of the Grand 
Cannon. It detonated deep underground and collapsed the facility, 
destroying it utterly.

(oO\O/Oo)

October 2012...

&quot;This session of the Macross Military War Bride&#39;s Club will now come to 
order,&quot; Claudia said officiously. Everyone rolled their eyes and 
giggled.

&quot;Claudia, we just all got together for lunch,&quot; Lisa grinned.

&quot;So what?&quot; Claudia grinned back. &quot;We; you, me, Ranma, Minmei, Miriya, 
were all engaged on the SDF-1 during the war. So we&#39;re like a club.&quot;

Everyone more or less agreed.

&quot;I think it&#39;s a cool idea,&quot; Minmei giggled.

&quot;Now for our first order of business...&quot; Claudia began before Ranma 
interrupted her.

&quot;Ordering lunch,&quot; Ranma supplied.

&quot;No, the first order of business is the progress on Operation: Get Ranma 
Pregnant,&quot; Claudia announced.

&quot;Eep!&quot; Ranma squeaked. If she had been drinking something it would have 
been sprayed all over the table.

&quot;Yes, Lisa, how is that going?&quot; Miriya asked, stroking her gravid belly. 
&quot;Max and I are expecting soon and I&#39;m so excited.&quot;

&quot;Mom and I haven&#39;t made much headway, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Lisa said with not a 
little disappointment. &quot;I&#39;d really like to have another and it is her 
turn. I wouldn&#39;t dream of depriving her of the experience.&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Ranma laughed nervously, &quot;I&#39;ll pass, honey. If you want another, 
I&#39;ll let you have the honors.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, that just wouldn&#39;t be right,&quot; Miriya grinned. &quot;You should both 
share the experience. It would bring you even closer. There&#39;s nothing 
like the joy and wonder of carrying a small life inside your body.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t wait,&quot; Minmei gushed. &quot;Rick and I have decided to try too, now 
that things have settled down.&quot;

&quot;Roy and I were thrilled when we found out I was pregnant a couple of 
months ago,&quot; Claudia added.

&quot;Oh please, Ranma,&quot; Lisa said, turning her ultimate weapon on the 
redhead, the big, glistening, puppy dog eyes. &quot;Please carry my child.&quot;

Ranma blushed as red as her hair.

&quot;Oh how can you resist that, Ranma?&quot; Claudia giggled.

&quot;Please? There&#39;s no more excuses,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Things are calm now and 
we can do without our star Veritech pilot for long enough. I promise, 
there&#39;s no feeling in the world like holding the child that grew inside 
you for the first time.&quot;

&quot;Except for maybe watching your wife hold the child that grew inside her 
for the first time,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;And you would deprive me of that?&quot; Lisa asked, smirking as she saw 
victory in her grasp.

&quot;You guys aren&#39;t going to let up until I do it, are you?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Nu uh,&quot; came four answers in unison from four faces with eager grins.

Ranma sighed heavily, knowing she was out of excuses. She asked herself 
if it would be that bad. Looking at Claudia and Miriya, she decided that 
it probably wouldn&#39;t be. They looked very happy. Finally, she held her 
hands up in defeat.

&quot;Okay, you win,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I guess I get to be the newest member of 
the Pregnant War Bride&#39;s Club.&quot;

Lisa squealed in feminine glee and glomped Ranma, nearly knocking her 
off the chair.

&quot;Oh thank you, Honey!&quot; Lisa gushed. &quot;You don&#39;t know how happy this makes 
me!&quot; She gave Ranma a steamy look. &quot;We&#39;ll get started right after 
lunch.&quot;

Ranma blushed deeply once again.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Do you trust me?&quot; Lisa asked, coming up to her with a silk scarf.

&quot;Implicitly,&quot; Ranma answered without hesitation.

Lisa smiled and tied the silk over Ranma&#39;s eyes, making sure she could 
see nothing. The brunette then began to slowly and sensually unclothe 
the redhead. Leading her to the bed, Lisa scooped her up and laid her 
down on the mattress. Taking an arm she secured it to the silk-lined 
cuff connected to on corner of the bed. She repeated the process with 
the other arm and each ankle until Ranma lay chained and vulnerably 
spread before her.

&quot;Comfy?&quot; Lisa purred, dragging her nails lightly across Ranma&#39;s flat 
tummy.

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Ranma said, smiling. &quot;I never knew you were so kinky.&quot;

&quot;I was talking to Bertha,&quot; Lisa giggled. &quot;She gave me a few ideas.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not going to do anything...bizarre, are you?&quot; Ranma asked, her 
lips making a worried pout.

&quot;No, Sweetie, this is just a little bondage,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;Bertha 
explained that not all parts of BDSM are about domination and 
humiliation. She explained that a person in bondage has the control 
taken from them. That frees them to focus just on what&#39;s being done to 
them. Done between two people who love each other, it allows the bound 
person to relax and enjoy what their lover is doing to them without 
feeling the need to give anything in return. So you just have to lay 
there and concentrate on the pleasure I&#39;m going to give you, okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Ranma smiled and nodded.

&quot;Good,&quot; Lisa grinned.

Lisa took out a feather and started at Ranma&#39;s wrist, dragging the 
feather lightly over her sensitive skin. Ranma shivered at the 
sensations, developing goose flesh and her nipples going instantly hard. 
Lisa lightly brushed the feather down Ranma&#39;s arms and over her 
shoulders, up her neck, along the line of her jaw and back up the other 
arm. She came back down and began to stroke the feather over Ranma&#39;s 
breasts, avoiding the areolas and nipples until each breast was stroked 
thoroughly and Ranma&#39;s engorged nipples were standing out, large, hard, 
and dark.

With the first teasing contact of the feather on her nipples, Ranma gave 
a deep sensual moan that sent a shiver down Lisa&#39;s spine. The moaning 
continued as Lisa slowly went from breast to breast, teasing Ranma&#39;s 
nipples lightly with the feather.

The feather left her breasts causing her to moan in complaint and then 
jump and giggle as it caressed her sides and across her flat, well-toned 
tummy. Ranma moaned and had a small climax as she felt Lisa&#39;s mouth and 
tongue come into play where the feather had just left. Meanwhile, the 
feather continued down and danced along the outsides of her legs before 
slowly and sensually moving upward and inward along her inner thighs.

By the time Lisa was done with the feather, Ranma&#39;s whole body was 
flushed pinkly with her arousal. The feather was removed from her skin 
and Ranma heard a buzzing sound as something smooth and vibrating was 
now caressing her sensually, following the same path as the feather. She 
squirmed and moaned as the object passed over her sensitive regions and 
jumped and giggled as it passed over her ticklish ones, working its way 
ever closer to her center.

By the time Lisa was done with this phase of Ranma&#39;s pleasurable 
torture, the redhead was begging Lisa to finish her.

&quot;You really want me to, Sweetie?&quot; Lisa asked teasingly.

&quot;Oh yes please,&quot; Ranma pleaded. &quot;I can&#39;t stand it. I&#39;m on fire.&quot;

&quot;Okay, just hold tight for just a second,&quot; Lisa said. Ranma could here 
the amusement in her tone even through her arousal-fogged mind.

The bound redhead felt Lisa&#39;s weight leave the bed. Ranma heard what 
sounded like water but was too fogged to put any significance on it. She 
didn&#39;t have time to think much because Lisa&#39;s weight returned to the bed 
as her wife climbed up between her spread limbs. She felt her lower 
region lifted up and a pillow was placed under her.

Some indeterminate amount of time and several screaming and whimpering 
releases later, Ranma lay panting, coated with a light layer of sweat in 
the aftermath of their delicious passion. It had been odd at first. 
Scary for Ranma, because she could almost swear she was being made love 
to by a man. But it had been Lisa&#39;s aura so Ranma had just put it down 
to Lisa using a life-like new toy.

Lisa had gotten out of the bed almost as soon as they were finished, but 
she soon returned to cuddle the redhead who was beginning to get cold.

&quot;Did you like that, Sweetie,&quot; Lisa asked.

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Ranma purred with contentment. &quot;That was great.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Lisa giggled as she set about removing the bonds and 
blindfold. &quot;I have a confession to make.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ranma asked, distracted by an odd feeling of something draining 
out. She put her finger in it and brought it where she could look. Her 
eyes grew big as saucers as she recognized the substance.

Lisa winced as Ranma&#39;s fearful gape snapped over to her and took on a 
betrayed expression.

&quot;Now, Honey, calm down,&quot; Lisa said, trying to sooth the obviously 
freaked out Ranma. &quot;It&#39;s not what you think.&quot;

&quot;You mean you didn&#39;t let some guy in here to take advantage of me?&quot; 
Ranma hissed.

&quot;I promise I was the only one in here with you,&quot; Lisa said firmly.

&quot;Then how do you explain this?&quot; Ranma demanded, thrusting her fluid 
coated finger in Lisa&#39;s face.

&quot;With this,&quot; Lisa said thrusting a paper packet in Ranma&#39;s face. Ranma 
took it and read the Chinese words on the packet.

&quot;Instant Nannichuan?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a temporary form of the opposite spring you fell into,&quot; Lisa 
grinned. &quot;The Amazons gave it to me and I&#39;ve been waiting for months to 
try it out. See, Honey, now we can get you pregnant the old fashioned 
way and have a lot of fun doing it.&quot; Lisa gave her a triumphant smile, 
which faded as the look of horror grew on Ranma&#39;s face.

&quot;It...it works?&quot; Ranma asked and Lisa nodded. &quot;Then that m...means I...I 
ha...had sex with a g...guy?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Ranma,&quot; Lisa said harshly to snap the redhead out of 
whatever line of thought she was going down. &quot;You had sex with me, your 
wife, the woman you love.&quot; Lisa grabbed the packet and waved it in 
Ranma&#39;s face. &quot;This is just another form of toy, another way for me to 
give you pleasure. You didn&#39;t have sex with a guy, understand?&quot;

Ranma stared at the wall for a while, her need to feel disgusted warring 
with the memory of how good it had felt and the irrefutable logic of 
Lisa&#39;s argument. After a fierce battle of emotions played out on the 
redhead&#39;s face, pleasure and logic won out. Ranma sighed.

&quot;I wish you had told me first,&quot; Ranma said at last.

&quot;I didn&#39;t want you to get hung up on the idea of having sex with a man,&quot; 
Lisa admitted. &quot;I thought this would be a better way to get past that. 
You know I would never hurt you.&quot;

&quot;I know, Lisa,&quot; Ranma said hugging her. &quot;So how was it for you? And when 
do I get to meet my &#39;husband&#39;?&quot; Ranma gave a small smirk.

&quot;It was fantastic,&quot; Lisa laughed. &quot;Very novel and something I could get 
to enjoy from time to time. I prefer the other way around though. As for 
your &#39;husband&#39;, I&#39;m afraid my husband is far more manly than yours is.&quot;

&quot;Thank god for that anyway,&quot; Ranma laughed.
