<h1>Night Angels (part 28 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/niteangel-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent let out a strangled cry as she felt the wooden 
stake go deep into her heart. As soon as Vic released it from his grasp, 
the dusky vampire fell back against a tree, whereas she slumped slowly 
to the ground.

As she fell, the mercenary had to will his heart to stop beating 
frantically within his chest. &quot;I... I can&#39;t believe I did it!&quot; Vic 
gasped, finally calming down. &quot;I thought... I was going to screw it 
up... but I did it! I&#39;ve killed that dyke vampire bitch!&quot; Then he heard 
a groaning. Startled, Vic glanced down.

Rally slowly craned her head upward. A trail of blood dripped from her 
mouth as she struggled to focus her pain-filled eyes at her assailant. 
But when they did, a look of fury came over the dusky vampire&#39;s face. 
&quot;You... you... bastard!&quot; she managed to snarl in a low voice.

Startled, Vic managed to calm himself down before smirking, &quot;So... 
you&#39;re not dead yet! Well don&#39;t worry, it won&#39;t take long... dyke! 
That&#39;s a piece of white oak that&#39;s in your fucking heart! So long as 
it&#39;s in there, you can&#39;t do anything to me!&quot; He then bent down, drawing 
an assault knife from his pack. &quot;Now all I have to do is to cut that 
fucking head of yours off and my path is clear to that pretty maid you 
had under your power!&quot;

&quot;Moria?&quot; Rally managed to say, still in pain. &quot;You fucker!&quot; she then 
growled. &quot;You... better stay away from her... or I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll do nothing, lezzie!&quot; Vic countered as he roughly forced Rally&#39;s 
neck up and prepared to decapitate her. &quot;You&#39;ve had that cute little 
maid under your thumb for so long, she&#39;s not interested in men anymore. 
I have a feeling it&#39;ll change as soon as you&#39;re gone.&quot;

&quot;I... would never do... anything like that to Moria!&quot; Rally shot back, 
straining to form every word. &quot;She... been interested in women... long 
before I came into the scene!&quot;

&quot;So says you,&quot; Vic snidely remarked as he placed the blade to Rally&#39;s 
neck. But before he could slash her throat, he heard a commotion to the 
left of him. &quot;Hmmm... sounds like Sir Integra&#39;s nearby.&quot; Putting aside 
the knife, he commented, &quot;Well, looks like your final death will have to 
wait &#39;til later.&quot; He then had a playful smile on his face as he added, 
&quot;But don&#39;t worry, I have an idea that Moria will forget you in time. Who 
knows, maybe in the future, I&#39;ll take care of that blonde bitch that you 
call &#39;Master&#39; as well!&quot; Slinging his pack over his shoulder, he made his 
way through the dense brush of the park. But as soon as he was going, 
Rally slowly began to move her right arm towards the offending stake 
within her heart, despite the immense pain it caused.

XXX

Several figures had departed a limousine that had drove up to the park 
facing the Brown Grouse public house. Greeting them, Pip Bernadotte and 
Bean Bandit then made their report to Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates 
Hellsing and Sir Hugh Islands. Nearby, Sir Shelby Penwood, Sir Reginald 
Townstead, Sir Cedric Kensington, and Walter C. Dolnez watched with 
concern as Seras Victoria and Richard Hedgley gently escorted Richard&#39;s 
daughter Moria out of the car.

The maid was in obvious distress, for it seems that she was also in a 
great deal of pain, if the way she clutched her chest was of any 
indication. &quot;Are you sure about it, Moria dear?&quot; Richard asked. &quot;You&#39;re 
certain it isn&#39;t your heart?&quot;

&quot;No Father,&quot; Moria gasped. &quot;Mr. Dolnez had already checked my pulse and 
found that it was normal. No, this pain is different - there&#39;s a memory 
with it.&quot; She took a few breaths and added, &quot;I can sense Rally&#39;s in the 
same pain as well, but what&#39;s causing it is a mystery!&quot;

The knights observed the young girl, noting her agony. &quot;Sympathetic 
pain,&quot; Sir Integra said in a low voice to her fellows. &quot;This is 
obviously a result of Moria&#39;s link with Rally. I fear that my friend has 
met with some misfortune.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Sir Penwood added. Turning to Sir Townstead, &quot;Have you found 
anything yet, Reginald?&quot;

&quot;Moria&#39;s having trouble focusing on any one thing because of the pain 
she&#39;s suffering, Shelby,&quot; Sir Townstead replied, who was accompanying 
Kenneth with the young lycanthrope.

It was at this moment that Vic appeared from the park. Deciding to play 
dumb, he called out, &quot;Hey, is anything up?&quot;

Bean took notice, but before he could say anything, Sir Integra 
called-out, &quot;We were notified through Captain Bernadotte that Rally 
Vincent is tracking the FREAK responsible for the M-5 wreck through the 
park. Have you seen her anytime in the last hour?&quot;

&quot;Uh... no, haven&#39;t seen her,&quot; Vic said, returning to the park, &quot;but if I 
find her, I&#39;ll let her know you&#39;re here, Sir Integra.&quot; He then 
disappeared into the brush.

Not liking what he heard, Bean walked-up to Sir Integra, who made her 
way to Moria, and whispered, &quot;He&#39;s lying! I saw him and Rally talking 
before they disappeared into the park! I&#39;ll see what he&#39;s really up to!&quot; 
He then followed Vic&#39;s trail, zipping-up his leather coat as he did.

&quot;What?&quot; Moria gasped, forgetting her pain. &quot;That cad&#39;s seen Rally? This 
can&#39;t be good, I&#39;ve got to find her!&quot; She then pulled herself out of the 
grasp of her father and Sir Townstead and raced into the park herself.

&quot;MORIA... WAIT!!!&quot; Seras called-out, following Moria. &quot;Sir Integra, I&#39;ll 
see what&#39;s going on! Please wait here while I&#39;m gone!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll await your word, Seras,&quot; Sir Integra answered just as the other 
knights accompanied her.

XXX

It had taken a few minutes before Moria began following a path, despite 
the pain in her chest. Although Bean had proceeded her a few seconds 
past, she had managed to pass him. It seems she had an advantage the 
courier didn&#39;t have - namely her link with Rally. Pausing, she ignored 
her pain and cleared her head.

&#39;Rally has to be close by,&#39; she thought to herself. Following a hunch, 
she took a new path through the brush.

XXX

It had taken a few minutes, but Rally had somehow managed to wrap her 
right hand around the stake. However, pulling it out was another matter, 
due to her pain. It wasn&#39;t the burning pain she would feel with 
something like holy water or Paladin Alexander Anderson&#39;s bayonets, but 
it was a crushing, heavy pain that permeated all over her body. She 
began to fancy if this was something akin to a heart attack. It was one 
of the few times she was glad she was a vampire rather than a human.

Bracing herself, Rally began to steadily pull at the stake, moving it 
out by millimeters - slowly and agonizing. Soon, she was beginning to 
see the results of her efforts; a line of blood showed how deep the 
stake went into her. Gritting her teeth, Rally continued to pull. It 
looked like if she would be successful.

Looked like, that is.

&quot;NO YOU DON&#39;T!!&quot; Vic growled, jamming his foot on the end of the stake, 
shoving it even further into Rally&#39;s heart. Her hopes dashed, the dusky 
vampire let out another strangled cry as the pain in her chest 
intensified.

XXX

&quot;AAUUUGGHHH!!!&quot; Moria coiled-up into a ball as a new explosion of pain 
hit her. It took her a few seconds to recover, but she had an idea what 
was happening. Taking a few deep breaths, she proceeded in her intended 
direction.

XXX

Vic grinned sadistically as he continued to grind his foot into the 
stake. Rally, unable to scream further, tried to fight the pain - until 
she could bear no more and passed-out as a result. After seeing her head 
go limp, Vic let-up on the pressure, then once again reached for his 
knife.

&quot;It would be easier if I had a machete to do this, then all I have to do 
is to whack this bitch&#39;s head off,&quot; the mercenary grumbled, pulling up 
Rally&#39;s head. &quot;But it would be harder to conceal it in my pack. Oh 
well,&quot; Vic added as he placed the blade against the dusky vampire&#39;s 
throat, &quot;it might be messy, but this will have to do the trick.&quot; 
Steeling himself, he began to draw the knife against Rally&#39;s skin...

When a blood-curdling scream from behind caught his attention, 
Surprised, turned to face whoever interrupted him - and was shoved to 
the ground by Moria, who began to frantically shake Rally&#39;s shoulders. 
&quot;RALLY... OH GOD, RALLY, ARE YOU ALRIGHT!?!?&quot; she shrieked, seeing no 
response. &quot;PLEASE SAY SOMETHING!!! RALLY!!! RALLYYYY!?!?&quot; Sobbing, she 
then embraced Rally, fearing the worse.

&quot;WHAT&#39;S GOING ON?? I HEARD A SCREAM AND...&quot; All of a sudden, Bean 
broke-out of the bushes, only to see what had happened. Then he caught 
sight of Vic and REALLY got upset! &quot;YOU BASTARD!!! WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY 
FRIEND!?!&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to know?&quot; was all Vic smirked as he aimed his pistol 
- and fired, striking Bean in the head.

XXX

Those who were waiting for Seras to signal them were alarmed by the 
shot. &quot;Dear lord!&quot; Sir Kensington gasped.

&quot;Agreed!&quot; Sir Integra added. &quot;I know we promised Seras we would wait, 
but this bears an immediate response!&quot; The entire group then raced to 
the source of the shot.

XXX

&quot;NOOOO!!!&quot; All this was almost too much for Moria to bear, seeing 
another person getting killed senselessly. Even though Vic didn&#39;t see 
it, the maid&#39;s eyes changed color, from emerald green to bluish-white. 
At the same time, fangs began to grow in her mouth as she glared 
hatefully at the mercenary.

&quot;Moria... don&#39;t... don&#39;t change...&quot; a voice... Rally&#39;s... whispered.

&quot;What?&quot; Abruptly, Moria&#39;s features reverted to normal. Through 
tear-stained eyes, the maid could see Rally weakly crane her head up. 
&quot;My god... I thought you were killed, just like your friend!&quot;

&quot;Got... news for... you, I&#39;m... already... d-dead,&quot; Rally managed to 
say, grinning. &quot;As for... Bean... don&#39;t... worry...&quot; She then passed-out 
again.

During this exchange, Vic&#39;s look of victory turned to surprise... mostly 
because Bean didn&#39;t fall to the ground. The much-larger man just jerked 
his head up, the bullet falling off his orange headband. &quot;You know,&quot; the 
courier growled, &quot;that hurt!&quot; He then charged after Vic, the mercenary 
shooting twice, this time into his chest - only to find it didn&#39;t stop 
him! Bean then grabbed Vic by the shoulders and head-butted him, a 
metallic &#39;clank&#39; sounding as the metal headband connected with Vic&#39;s 
forehead.

&quot;Ow... dammit!&quot; Bean grumbled, stumbling backwards. &quot;Nobody wins with a 
head-butt!&quot; He then stood there, recovering from not only from it, but 
also the bullets hitting his armored coat. &quot;Between this and the coat, 
I&#39;m going to be really bruised tomorrow!&quot; Then he turned his attention 
back to Rally. &quot;Oh man, this is bad! Do you know how to help her?&quot; said 
Bean to Moria, noticing the stake in his friend&#39;s heart.

Regaining her wits, Moria looked around. &quot;We have to find Sir Integra! 
She&#39;ll know that to do!&quot; She then looked at Bean and added, &quot;But how in 
the world did you survive those gunshots?&quot;

Before Bean could reply, several individuals broke through the brush. 
&quot;We have heard shooting!&quot; Sir Integra announced, the rest of the knights 
following her, with Seras closely behind. &quot;Is everything alright?&quot; Then 
she saw Rally. &quot;Oh dear god!&quot; she gasped, horrified. She then knelt down 
to her stricken friend.

Following Sir Integra, Pip, Seras, Walter and the knights looked in 
horror at what happened. &quot;Oh no!!!&quot; the Draculina gasped, kneeling 
besides Moria and Sir Integra. Behind the Hellsing leader, Alucard 
appeared, his arms folded as he stood hostilely glaring at the 
unconscienous Vic, who was being hoisted over Bean&#39;s shoulder.

Rally once again woke-up, seeing she was the center of attention. 
&quot;Well... looks like... I&#39;ve got everyone worried.&quot; She had managed a 
small smile as she weakly added, &quot;S-sorry... about that.&quot; She then 
grimaced hard as more pain shot through her chest.

&quot;Sir Integra, we&#39;ve got to help Rally!&quot; Moria implored, tears still 
streaming from her face. &quot;Is there any special way to get this loathsome 
stake out of her?&quot;

&quot;Only one - the stake has to be physically pulled from her!&quot; Sir Integra 
crisply said, placing a comforting hand across Rally&#39;s cheek.

&quot;It will be painful, though. Believe me, I&#39;ve had practical experience 
at it, no thanks to Sir Integra&#39;s illustrious ancestor,&quot; the No-Life 
King added, bending down. &quot;You had better brace yourself, Rally 
Vincent,&quot; he said. &quot;This will NOTbe pleasant!&quot; However, before Alucard 
could grip the stake, Moria held-out her arm.

&quot;Thank you for your offer to help, Alucard,&quot; she began, &quot;but it will 
have to be MY HAND that will help her!&quot; Once again shifting her eyes, 
she placed her right hand around the offending stake.

&quot;Are you certain this is the right idea, young lady?&quot; Sir Island asked. 
&quot;You are in considerable pain yourself.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Moria,&quot; Kenneth added, &quot;please allow Alucard to do this.&quot;

&quot;Father... I&#39;m firm about this!&quot; Moria confirmed in an unnecessarily 
loud voice. &quot;I&#39;m certain I can endure!&quot; Looking at Rally, she added, 
&quot;Best prepare, my lovely! This is going to be hard on both of us!&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Rally managed to say, nodding.

Alucard was silent for a moment. &quot;By all means, Miss Hedgley,&quot; he 
finally said, gently smiling as he rose and took his place besides Sir 
Integra.

For a few seconds, both Rally and Moria braced themselves for what 
looked like a painful experience. Seras, in the meantime, quickly 
took-up a position behind Moria, just in case the maid passed-out from 
the pain. Then, in one swift motion, Moria pulled the stake from Rally&#39;s 
chest, both girls yelping painfully as a result. Rally curled-up in a 
ball, obviously getting the worst of the pain, while Moria collapsed in 
Seras&#39; arms.

&quot;OH... CRAP!!!&quot; Rally finally managed to gasp, craning her head up. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what was worst, getting that thing shoved into me... or 
getting it pulled-out!&quot; She then settled back against the tree. &quot;You 
alright, Moria?&quot;

&quot;I... I am now,&quot; the maid gasped, relieved. &quot;The pain&#39;s gone. How about 
you?&quot;

Rally shifted around, then winced. &quot;Still hurts... but not as much.&quot; 
Then the dusky vampire caught sight of Vic, whose limp form was now upon 
Bean&#39;s shoulder. A look of murderous fury came over Rally&#39;s face as her 
eyes glowed brilliantly. &quot;Get him out of my sight, Bean!&quot; she growled. 
&quot;If I wasn&#39;t in this state, I would be tearing him to pieces right now!&quot;

&quot;I... I wouldn&#39;t blame you if you did, Rally,&quot; Bean uneasily said, not 
wishing to argue with his friend. But before he left, he presented Sir 
Integra with Vic&#39;s pack. &quot;Thought you might want to see this, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Sir Integra, intrigued with the contents, reached inside and produced 
the other stake. Seras, who was helping Moria up, couldn&#39;t help but to 
feel uncomfortable seeing the implement. &quot;That could have been meant for 
me,&quot; the Draculina observed.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Sir Integra added, also taking note. &quot;Bean, follow the guards 
back to the mansion. As soon as you arrive, hand that... this creature 
to them,&quot; she said with an obvious note of distaste. &quot;They will know 
what to do.&quot; She then turned her attention to Rally. &quot;Can you get up, 
friend?&quot; she asked.

Looking doubtful, the dusky vampire decided to make the effort. But try 
as she might, she was having trouble getting on her feet, mostly from 
the residual pain she was suffering. However, before she could voice any 
complaint, Moria stepped forward. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind Rally, I would like 
to help.&quot; Moria then concentrated briefly. Her eyes shifted from green 
to white, then she bent over and picked-up Rally and cradled her in her 
arms.

&quot;Geez Moria,&quot; Rally complained, &quot;at least give me a chance to try!&quot;

&quot;Sorry about this Rally, but it&#39;s obvious that you&#39;re currently in no 
condition to stand on your feet,&quot; the maid countered firmly. &quot;Besides,&quot; 
she added with a smile, &quot;you and Seras always managed to sweep me off my 
feet, so I figured it was only fair that I return the compliment.&quot;

A little confused, Rally exchanged looks between Moria and Seras. &quot;Don&#39;t 
look at me, Rally,&quot; the Draculina said. &quot;She&#39;s got you on this one, so I 
suggest you sit quietly and enjoy the ride.&quot;

&quot;Fine Master, fine,&quot; Rally sighed, Moria adjusting her load as she 
carried Rally from the park, Seras following behind.

The four male knights just happened to look upon this scene with 
restrained bemusement before Sir Islands began with, &quot;You know Cedric, 
Shelby, Reginald... I might not agree with this sort of homosexual 
relationship those three have... but I do believe they were meant for 
each other.&quot;

&quot;Quite so, Hugh,&quot; Sir Kensington added, smiling.

&quot;No argument here, Cedric, Hugh, Reginald,&quot; Sir Penwood further added, 
then stretching, he turned to Sir Integra and said, &quot;Well, I believe we 
can trust you to handle the morrow&#39;s affairs, Sir Integra, so I think we 
will be taking our leave of you. We will not get in your way.&quot;

&quot;If you pardon me for saying, gentlemen,&quot; Sir Townstead put in, &quot;I would 
like to be on hand when it occurs.&quot; He looked at Sir Integra and further 
said, &quot;Moria and I may not be of blood, but she is family, and I believe 
I should be present when the crisis happens and help her through it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll get no complaint from me, Reggie,&quot; Kenneth said. &quot;If you&#39;ll 
excuse us, we should be getting back, Sir Integra.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; the Hellsing leader said, but then added, &quot;Walter?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir Integra?&quot; the old butler repeated.

&quot;We have to prepare for tomorrow night,&quot; Sir Integra explained. &quot;Here is 
what I want you to tell Moria once we return...&quot;

THE SUB-BASEMENT LEVELS, A FEW MINUTES LATER...

&quot;There you go, my lovely,&quot; Moria said as she laid Rally down on the 
coffin/bed she, the dusky vampire and Seras shared, said Draculina at 
her side. &quot;You just lie here and recover.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Moria,&quot; Rally said. However, as she began settling herself 
down, she couldn&#39;t help but to wince. &quot;Ow-Ow-Ow! I&#39;ve got a bad feeling 
that because of that pissant Vic, I&#39;m going to be sore for a few 
nights!&quot;

Moria looked sympathetically upon Rally for a few seconds, then a 
seductive smile came over her face. &quot;Oh really? Well, I believe I have a 
simple solution to your problem.&quot; She then pulled back the collar of her 
maid uniform, exposing her neck. &quot;Here, the solution to what is ailing 
you, my lovely,&quot; she said. &quot;And as much as you need.&quot;

&quot;Are you certain about this?&quot; asked Rally, looking at her friend/lover 
dubiously.

&quot;Come now, Rally,&quot; Seras admonished, &quot;just because Moria is offering her 
blood for you, there&#39;s no reason to doubt her. Besides, you&#39;ll heal much 
faster if you do.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I get it,&quot; Rally chuckled as Moria laid besides her. Taking the 
maid into her embrace, the dusky vampire gingerly leaned over her. &quot;You 
did it for me before, so I guess it&#39;s no harm if you did it again.&quot;

&quot;I would do it a hundred times, maybe more... just for you and Seras, my 
lovely,&quot; Moria replied, tenderly looking at Rally. After pausing for a 
bit, the dusky vampire moved closer towards the maid&#39;s neck, fangs 
lengthening as Rally prepared to indulge upon Moria&#39;s warm essence.

Moria, for her part, sensually craned her head upwards, exposing her 
neck. As Rally closed in, she closed her green eyes as she trembled in 
ecstatic anticipation of those fangs penetrating it. Her breathing 
became huskier, and a smile seemed to part her lips as Rally&#39;s mouth 
grew near. Moria felt that she was about to climax when she felt the 
tips of the fangs touch...

... When a gentle rapping was heard at the door, ruining the moment. 
&quot;Miss Hedgley?&quot; Walter asked from the other side, &quot;If you are currently 
not busy, I wish to speak to both you and Miss Victoria.&quot;

Rally groaned inwardly. &quot;Talk about bad timing,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Couldn&#39;t 
you tell him you&#39;ll see him later?&quot;

Moria looked equally disappointed. &quot;I wish I could... but I&#39;m sorry 
Rally, Mr. Dolnez is my direct supervisor, so I cannot refuse him.&quot; 
Leaning over to the door, she called out, &quot;In a minute, Mr. Dolnez.&quot; She 
then turned her attention back to Rally and added, &quot;Hopefully it&#39;ll be 
brief, so don&#39;t worry yourself.&quot; She kissed the vampire briefly on the 
lips, &quot;Wait-up for me, dear.&quot;

Seras walked by Moria side as the maid got herself up and straightened 
herself, adding with a smile, &quot;I&#39;ve got this funny feeling that you&#39;re 
actually enjoying us feeding off you.&quot; Moria didn&#39;t reply, but smiled 
just the same.

As soon as the two exited the room, Walter, who was standing nearby, 
began with, &quot;First off Miss Hedgley, Sir Integra wanted to inform you 
that you can have the next three nights off - with pay, of course.&quot;

&quot;Three days?&quot; repeated Moria. &quot;Did I do something wrong, Mr. Dolnez?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, nothing of the sort,&quot; the butler replied. &quot;However, Sir Integra 
would like to explain the reasons why, so you should meet with her 
tomorrow.&quot; Then as an afterthought, he added, &quot;Preferably before 
sunset.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Moria said, mystified. &quot;I guess I will see you tomorrow 
night.&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot; Then turning to Seras, Walter further said, &quot;Miss Victoria, I 
would like to meet with as well.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Walter,&quot; the Draculina said, then turned to Moria. &quot;Don&#39;t wait up 
for me, Moria. I&#39;m sure this wouldn&#39;t take too long.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Moria then returned to the room.

But as soon as the door closed, Walter motioned for Seras to follow. 
Curious, she followed - and was startled to see Alucard as well. 
&quot;Forgive us for interrupting, Police Girl,&quot; the red-clad vampire began, 
&quot;one that concerns Miss Moria.&quot;

Seras took note of the seriousness on her former master&#39;s face. 
&quot;Alright, let&#39;s have it,&quot; she finally said.

XXX

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Rally asked as Moria once again settled 
herself besides the dusky vampire.

&quot;Oh, just that I&#39;ve been given the next three nights off, fully paid,&quot; 
Moria replied, loosening her collar again. &quot;Strange though. I&#39;ve noticed 
that Mr. Dolnez has this serious expression on his face as he told me 
this.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rally agreed. &quot;Did he tell you why you got the nights off?&quot;

Moria just shook her head. &quot;Only that Sir Integra would tell me about it 
in the morrow.&quot; She then deeply looked into Rally&#39;s eyes. &quot;Oh, my 
lovely... I was so scared that I was to lose you tonight. When I saw 
that loathsome stake in your heart...&quot; a tear rolled from her eye, &quot;it 
took everything in my will not to transform and tear that... that Vic 
into shreds!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t,&quot; Rally whispered, catching the tear with a finger. 
&quot;I would&#39;ve hated to see you soil those hands of yours with someone&#39;s 
blood - not that it might happen anyway.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Rally.&quot; Moria then took a breath to steady herself, then 
added with a smile, &quot;Now... what were we about to do before we were so 
rudely interrupted?&quot;

Rally smiled in turn. &quot;I think it was... this!&quot; She then bend-down over 
the maid&#39;s neck and plunged her fangs into it.

Moria gasped orgasmically, embracing her vampire lover as Rally slowly 
consumed her blood. &quot;That&#39;s it, my lovely!&quot; she huskily whispered, &quot;Take 
as much as you need - or want! You can even take it all if you like!&quot;

&#39;I don&#39;t think that&#39;ll be necessary, Moria dear,&#39; Rally mentally told 
her, not wishing to spill a drop of the warm, rich fluid issuing forth.

XXX

&quot;I see,&quot; Seras grimly said, nodding. &quot;To think Moria is going to be 
experiencing a spontaneous transformation tomorrow is terrifying at 
best.&quot;

&quot;That was why Sir Integra had given her the three nights off - which are 
the three nights of the full moon,&quot; Alucard said, &quot;so that her father 
could properly instruct her on how to fight them.&quot;

The Draculina nodded further, taking this in. &quot;And you say it&#39;ll be best 
if Kenneth and Sir Townstead are the ones to break this to her - neither 
me nor Rally?&quot;

&quot;Quite true,&quot; Walter added. &quot;After all, it should be family that would 
tell Miss Hedgley about this latest trial. However, I would be prudent 
if you should inform your apprentice about this as well - discreetly, of 
course.&quot;

&quot;That I will, Walter I&#39;d best get ready to tell Rally about this,&quot; Seras 
said. &quot;However, we would like to be there when it occurs. I have a 
feeling that Rally might be one that will be able to comfort Moria, 
should something go wrong.&quot;

&quot;Very good, Seras,&quot; Alucard added. &quot;Well, I believe we shouldn&#39;t be 
keeping you from your rest. The sun should be rising soon.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Master,&quot; the blonde vampire said. Then acknowledging the two, 
Seras then departed to her room.

&quot;And I think I should get a little rest as well,&quot; Walter said, 
stretching. &quot;It has been a long night, you know, Alucard. I might as 
well turn-in.&quot;

&quot;Then I will see you next evening, Walter,&quot; the nosferatu said, bowing 
like a gentleman before the two parted. Then strangely, almost out of a 
whim, Alucard decided to head for the Wild Geese&#39;s barracks.

Sure enough, Alucard was greeted by a sullen Pip, who was leaning 
against the wall, one of his cigarettes in his mouth. &quot;I take it that 
your suggestion to Sir Integra of placing that idiot Vic before a firing 
squad did not go well, did it?&quot;

&quot;Oui,&quot; the one-eyed Frenchman said angrily, exhaling an acrid cloud of 
smoke. &quot;Zat bastard hurt my friend Rally in zat park - almost cutting 
her head off een ze bargain!&quot;

&quot;But I suspect that Rally Vincent&#39;s welfare isn&#39;t why you&#39;re so angry?&quot; 
Alucard further smirked, knowing how he felt towards Seras. &quot;Mind if you 
tell me?&quot;

Pip looked-up at the vampire. Normally, this would terrify him but for 
some reason the mercenary was more angry than frightened. &quot;Eet&#39;s... 
eet&#39;s Mignonette, Alucard. I know I have almost no way of wooing her, 
but I still care deeply for her. And seeing her zo terribly frightened 
and horrified with what happened to Rally...&quot; he hesitated, as if to 
contain the urge to punch a hole in the wall, &quot;I just want to do 
SOMETHING to get back at him... but I don&#39;t know what!&quot;

Alucard nodded, listening. &quot;Have you suggested having Vic fed to Rally?&quot; 
he offered.

&quot;I did. Sir Integra told me zat she would ONLY do zat eef ze security of 
ze Hellsing Organization ees at risk.&quot;

&quot;She can be very stubborn about that part,&quot; Alucard drolled, nodding. 
&quot;How about if I offer you... an alternative?&quot;

Pip just looked at the vampire with his single eye, curious. &quot;Oh?&quot; he 
asked.

XXX

It was a few minutes later when Seras had returned to the room, already 
feeling the effects of the upcoming sun. Looking at the coffin/bed, she 
happened to see that Rally seemed more at ease. &quot;Feeling better?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Much, Master,&quot; the dusky vampire replied. &quot;The pain&#39;s gone and I&#39;m 
completely healed.&quot; She then looked down at a sleeping Moria, who had a 
smile on her face, two fresh puncture wounds on her neck. &quot;She&#39;s had a 
rough night tonight,&quot; Rally mused sleepily as she caressed Moria&#39;s 
cheek. &quot;From what I&#39;ve learned when I drank her blood, she was afraid I 
might have been sent to my final death.&quot; Laying down, Rally yawned as 
she added, &quot;Come to think of it... the same thing crossed my mind as 
that asshole shoved that stake in with his foot. I was so scared what 
would happen to Moria without me around to protect her.&quot;

&quot;You do tend to be rather defensive of her,&quot; mused Seras, smiling. &quot;Of 
course, since she first gave you her blood, it&#39;s understandable.&quot;

&quot;That bastard thought I was hypnotically compelling Moria to ignore men 
so that I can have her for my own,&quot; Rally added, again yawning. &quot;Even if 
I could, I would never do such a thing to her.&quot;

Seras was still smiling when she added, &quot;Well rest assured there&#39;s no 
way that&#39;s going to occur. Lycans cannot be mesmerized by a vampire, no 
matter how hard they try.&quot; Her mood then changed, &quot;Rally, there&#39;s 
something I need to tell you...&quot;

Rally yawned heavily as she interrupted, &quot;Can&#39;t this wait until sunset, 
Master? I&#39;m too tired. Geez, summer nights are WAY too short in London.&quot; 
She then mumbled sleepily as she muttered, &quot;Can&#39;t... wait... &#39;til 
winter...&quot;

&quot;I guess she had a rough night, too,&quot; Seras sighed. &quot;Sorry Rally... but 
I&#39;m afraid this cannot wait until dusk.&quot; Deciding not to fight her 
body&#39;s growing fatigue, she nestled closer to Rally, then closed the 
lid. As for Rally, she snuggled protectively near Moira, draping her arm 
around the slumbering maid...

When once again, Rally found her mind was once again in the dream world 
created by Seras. &quot;OH MAN!!!&quot; the dusky vampire exclaimed, finding 
herself AGAIN dressed in a variant of Seras&#39; yellow Hellsing miniskirt 
uniform. &quot;MASTER, DO YOU KNOW HOW ANNOYING THIS IS!?!?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Rally, but this couldn&#39;t be helped,&quot; answered Seras in a 
regretful tone, once again dressed in her old blue uniform as she 
stepped in front of her childe. &quot;Rally, this is concerning Moria but it 
cannot wait for later.&quot;

Rally groaned. &quot;I... I guess there&#39;s no fighting it, Master.&quot; She then 
sat on the bench with Seras offered, then listened carefully as her 
master made her report. &quot;Okay... I&#39;m listening.&quot;

HELLSING MANSION, BELOW THE THIRD FLOOR LANDING, BEFORE SUNSET...

&quot;Hey take it easy, Moria!&quot; Rally called-out, seeing the maid exuberantly 
climb the stair. &quot;Man, you&#39;re so full of energy tonight!&quot;

&quot;Yes, considering the amount of blood you offered Rally,&quot; Seras added. 
However, the two vampires looked at each other, each with an expression 
of worry.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, you two,&quot; Moria answered, &quot;but I really want to find-out why 
Sir Integra gave me the next three nights off.&quot; Looking at the two, she 
added, &quot;Perhaps, if she&#39;s in a good mood, we might head over to 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket to celebrate my birthday.&quot; But then she had an 
uncomfortable thought, remembering the attack by S.H.I.E.L.D. on the 
club, which she was wounded... but dismissed it all when she said, 
&quot;After all, I cannot let something like what had happened a few days 
back run my life! After all, one cannot live their lives in fear!&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah,&quot; Rally replied, a sick feeling in her gut.

&quot;We&#39;ll... see what Sir Integra says first, okay?&quot; Seras added, feeling 
equally queasy.

Moria thought about this for a bit. &quot;I would guess she might have 
something special in mind... so I&#39;ll ask first,&quot; she said, bounding up 
the stairs. Rally and Seras again looked at each other, then followed.

But as they made the landing, all three happened to see Bean standing 
outside Sir Integra&#39;s office, a grim look on his face. &quot;Rally, so you 
have a minute-or-two?&quot; he asked, not smiling.

&quot;I guess, Bean,&quot; replied a mystified Rally, who then turned to her 
companions and added, &quot;You two go on ahead. I&#39;ll find out what&#39;s going 
on.&quot; Both Seras and Moria nodded, then entered the office. As soon as 
the door was closed, the dusky vampire turned to her old friend and 
said, &quot;From the look on that face of yours, I guess this has something 
to do with last night, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Bean nodded in agreement. &quot;It&#39;s about how you reacted when I hauled that 
Vic guy out. I&#39;ve seen you mad before, but the look on your face last 
night...&quot; he took a breath and added, &quot;it was outright murderous! I&#39;ve 
never seen that look ever on your face before!&quot; He paused for a bit, &quot;Is 
this what it means of becoming a vampire, Rally?&quot;

Now Rally had to admit that Bean had carefully thought his question 
through. &quot;I guess it does,&quot; she said finally. &quot;Bean... this wasn&#39;t what 
I had in mind exactly, but it goes with the territory. Ever since 
becoming a vampire, I found myself becoming more aggressive than before 
- almost to the point of killing people! That was part of the reason I 
left Chicago... until I could learn better how to control my powers 
without killing innocent people while doing it.&quot;

The burly courier took this all in, nodding. &quot;Just what I thought you 
would say, Rally,&quot; he replied, placing a hand on Rally&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I 
had a talk with Sir Integra a while ago... and learned of some 
additional duties that were forced upon your shoulders.&quot;

&quot;You mean... being Hellsing&#39;s clean-up specialist, the person that has 
to kill people to keep the organization secret?&quot; Rally replied.

&quot;Exactly. But I also told Sir Integra that, when I take upon a 
commission, that includes a confidentiality pledge - provided that kids 
aren&#39;t harmed as a result.&quot; Bean then smiled as he added, &quot;So you don&#39;t 
have to worry about killing me, Rally. I can see you&#39;re doing a good job 
here, regarding all these phony vampires. I also told her that, if she 
needs me to take-down that FREAK that was responsible for the M-5 
accident, that she can count on me and the Buff to help.&quot;

A big smile came over Rally&#39;s face - which inadvertently displayed her 
fangs. Then she remembered, covering her mouth with her hands. Then she 
heard Bean laugh. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry about it, Rally!&quot; he crowed, 
slapping her shoulders. &quot;Just because those teeth of yours are a little 
sharper, it doesn&#39;t mean you have to hide them from me!&quot;

&quot;Then you should see me when I REALLY push my power!&quot; Rally smirked. &quot;I 
don&#39;t think Integra or Moria seen it... but when I go to FULL POWER, I 
can cause nightmares! There was only one human that seen it... but she 
was so jaded, it didn&#39;t phase her!&quot;

&quot;Oh I think I&#39;ll survive!&quot; Bean laughed.

SIR INTEGRA&#39;S OFFICE, TWO MINUTES PRIOR...

As Moria and Seras entered the office, they happened to notice that, 
alongside Sir Integra and Walter, Kenneth and Sir Townstead were there 
as well. &quot;Father, Uncle Reggie,&quot; Moria began. &quot;I didn&#39;t think you two 
would be here.&quot;

&quot;I think... the circumstances warrant it,&quot; Kenneth said warily.

Sir Integra nodded, taking note of the gradually-darkening sky outside. 
&quot;Moria, before we continue any further, I would like to take this time 
to wish you &#39;happy birthday&#39;,&quot; she said, smiling.

&quot;Why thank you, Sir Integra,&quot; Moria replied, blushing as she bowed. &quot;And 
on that note, I was wondering if it was at all possible that me, Seras 
and Rally could leave tonight for Arisugawa&#39;s Locket to celebrate?&quot;

&quot;Moria,&quot; Sir Integra began uncomfortably, &quot;Believe me, I above all 
people would enjoy seeing you enjoy this occasion,&quot; she shifted absently 
in her chair, &quot;but I am afraid that, for the next three days, it is out 
of the question.&quot;

Moria was dumbstruck; Seras already knew the reason. &quot;But... but why?&quot; 
she asked, gravely disappointed.

&quot;For that, I must let your father explain that.&quot; Sir Integra then looked 
to Kenneth and said, &quot;It is your turn now.&quot; Uncomfortably, Kenneth 
walked up to his daughter.

&quot;Father...&quot; Moria asked, seeing the look of her father&#39;s face, &quot;is... is 
there something wrong?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get to that,&quot; Kenneth mumbled. &quot;Do you recall what I had told you 
how the full moon affects us?&quot;

&quot;Why certainly,&quot; the maid said. &quot;The nights of the full moon, you said, 
is the time we are most powerful.&quot;

&quot;True, Moria.&quot; Kenneth took a deep breath before adding, &quot;However, what 
had slipped my mind was that, with that power comes a great cost. Upon 
sunset, we also undergo a spontaneous transformation, one we do not 
initiate.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Moria asked, suddenly feeling a knot in her stomach.

A tear falls from Kenneth&#39;s eye as he adds, &quot;And the form we can take is 
not the bipedal form you&#39;re now used to... but one of a huge, 
quadrapedal wolf!&quot; He now saw the distress in Moria&#39;s face. &quot;But it&#39;s 
not a transformation we cannot control. I&#39;ve been able to retain my 
human form through the course of four hundred years, so now I must teach 
you how to do this... otherwise, if you do transform, you will not be 
able to return to your human form until sunrise.&quot;

Moria just stood thunderstruck. &quot;Dear lord,&quot; she finally said. 
&quot;Father... why hadn&#39;t you told me this sooner?&quot;

&quot;Like when you found-out your werewolf heritage, I never thought it was 
necessary,&quot; Kenneth said as he tried to comfort his daughter, only to 
find her shy away. &quot;I understand you&#39;re angry with me, Moria, and I do 
not blame you. But please, let me help you tonight.! I promise we&#39;ll get 
through this together!&quot;

&quot;Please Moria,&quot; Sir Townstead added. &quot;It was not your father&#39;s intention 
to harm you in any way.&quot;

There was a tangible amount of quiet in the office before Moria spoke. 
&quot;I... I guess you never meant to deceive me Father, Uncle Reggie. It&#39;s 
just that...&quot; she trembled at the thought. &quot;Oh god... a wolf... and 
until dawn? How will I be able to cope?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Moria dear,&quot; Seras added, embracing her, &quot;Me and Rally 
will be here as well.&quot;

&quot;I... yes.&quot; All of a sudden though, Moria&#39;s head shot-up, as if she had 
heard something.

&quot;Moria?&quot; Kenneth asked. &quot;Is there anything wrong?&quot;

&quot;All of a sudden,&quot; the maid said, going to the large window behind Sir 
Integra&#39;s desk, &quot;I feel so... strange.&quot; She then looked up at the sky, 
staring at the brilliant full moon outside. Then quite suddenly, her 
eyes shifted from green to blue-white.

&quot;Moria, what is happening?&quot; Sir Integra asked, only to get silence from 
the girl. As for Moria, she happened to down to her hands - only to see 
grayish tuffs of fur sprouting from them.

&quot;It&#39;s started,&quot; Kenneth said. &quot;Moria, listen to me, try to will the 
transformation reversed! It&#39;s the only way to stop it!&quot;

Moria nodded and began to concentrate, but her mind was so clouded by 
the previous shock she was having little success. Dropping to her knees, 
she saw to her horror that her hands was beginning to stretch out on 
their own accord.

Tears of fear were streaming from Moria&#39;s eyes as she vainly tried to 
reverse the transformation. &quot;IT&#39;S... IT&#39;S NO USE, I CANNOT STOP IT!!&quot; 
she cried as her face gradually began to form a wolf-like snout. &quot;OH 
GOD!!! RALLY, HELP MEEEEE!!!&quot;
