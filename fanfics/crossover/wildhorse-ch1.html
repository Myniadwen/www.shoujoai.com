<h1>The Wild Horse Thesis (part 1 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/calamity.html">Calamity-Queen of Cordite</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I...ahem...borrowed the concept for this story from an Anime Addventure 
thread and tweaked it for my purposes. I&#39;d like to give a hat-tip to the 
writers who contributed to that thread.

Forward: For some reason, I am compelled to toss Ranma into a Sci-fi 
world and see what happens. I&#39;ve done so once again with this story. 
Please be warned, some characters are OOC with respect to how they are 
portrayed in the canon stories. I justify this as having vastly 
different interactions with the other characters. In Ranma&#39;s case, it&#39;s 
also because he is in a different world with foreknowledge of what is to 
come. If he wants to survive it, he is forced to change his ways.

A note on Asuka: I don&#39;t see Asuka as being the same as Akane. She&#39;s way 
more like Ranma; stupendously large Ego, driven to be the best, etc. She 
doesn&#39;t hate boys. The only reason (IMHO) that she treats Shinji like 
crap is because she sees him as a spineless wuss that somehow manages to 
show her up repeatedly. Ranma is definitely NOT Shinji so she will react 
differently to him.

As always, I wrote this story for my enjoyment and am sharing it with 
you for yours. If you are offended by Lesbian themes, polygamous 
relationships, minors being intimate, or harsh language, you might want 
to pass on this story. If you are a Canon Cop or an Agent Against 
Acceptance (by Ranma of her female form), you might want to pass on this 
story.

I&#39;d like to thank James R. Axelrad for his tireless cajoling and his 
generous sharing of his knowledge of the NGE movie storyline. I&#39;d also 
like to thank JohnnyG for putting up with the error riddled drafts I 
send him for editing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Hikaru Gosunkugi knelt just outside a circled pentagram. Between where 
each of the points met the outer circle, there guttered five blood-red 
candles. In the center of the circle lay a stack of video tapes on top 
of which rested a straw doll. The doll had a piece of ragged, red silk 
wrapped around its torso and if one looked closely, one could see a red 
hair and a black hair wrapped around its head. The cover on the video 
tapes read &#39;Neon Genesis Evangelion&#39;.

It had been a week since that strange, cowled figure had given him the 
spell scroll, but now the time had come to cast the spell that would 
solve all of dear, sweet Akane&#39;s problems. He began to chant the words 
of the spell while moving around and lighting the incense sticks in each 
of the small bowls of powdered spell components.

Still chanting, Gosunkugi returned to his starting point and resumed 
seiza position. As he completed his chant, each of the bowls of 
components suddenly flared into a column of intense fire. Gosunkugi felt 
occult forces drain his energy as the spell performed its purpose.

Suddenly, the fires winked out as the candles burned down to nothing, 
leaving the room cloaked in darkness. The only sound was the would-be 
mage hitting the floor as he passed out from the energy drain.

(oO\O/Oo)

It had been three days. The Tendo home was currently hosting a meeting 
of people concerned with the disappearance of one Ranma Saotome. The 
pigtailed martial artist had vanished without a trace. He hadn&#39;t gone on 
a training trip, as his pack and all of his clothes and belongings were 
still there. In fact, there was evidence that he vanished right from his 
bedding since a check of his futon revealed his typical tank top and 
boxers laying in it.

Nabiki&#39;s network had turned up nothing. The Amazon&#39;s claimed to have 
nothing to do with it, although Cologne had indicated that there was a 
taint of magic in the room. Happosai, likewise, claimed to have nothing 
to do with it, citing that he would never want to get rid of his 
Ranma-chan. Of course, Kuno claimed he had defeated the foul sorcerer 
and the cowardly cur had fled from his manly presence using his dark 
magics. Nobody gave that any credibility.

The elders and fianc&eacute;es were discussing the problem when Kasumi entered 
the room with a box that had just been delivered.

&quot;What&#39;s that, Kasumi?&quot; Nabiki asked.

&quot;Why, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;It was just delivered. It&#39;s addressed 
to the Tendo Dojo.&quot;

&quot;Well, let&#39;s see what it is,&quot; Nabiki said, taking the box and quickly 
opening it.

Inside she found several anime videotapes titled &#39;Neon Genesis 
Evangelion 1/2&#39; and a letter. Nabiki quickly opened the letter and read 
it. Her eyes narrowed as she did. Looking up at the expectant faces, she 
decided to read it out loud.

&quot;To whom it may concern,

Ranma Saotome will no longer trouble any of you again. He has been 
banished from this world in punishment for all the pain he has caused. 
If you would like to view his fate, if only for closure, watch the 
videos and delight.&quot;

&quot;There is no signature,&quot; Nabiki finished.

&quot;These items have the same taint of magic I felt in his room,&quot; Cologne 
said, examining the tapes.

&quot;Well, I suppose we should watch them,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;That might give us 
a clue as to where he is and how to get him back.&quot;

Everyone else agreed as Nabiki put the first tape into the VCR.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma stared at the picture in his hand. It was a picture of a woman 
that was beautiful enough to give his fianc&eacute;es a run for their money. 
Written on it were suggestive statements and arrows to draw attention to 
the woman&#39;s assets. She also looked very familiar.

But that wasn&#39;t what Ranma was thinking about at the moment. No, at the 
moment he was trying to wrap his brain around the fact that the last 
thing he remembered up to this point was that he had gone to bed at the 
Tendo&#39;s and now suddenly he was on a train looking at this picture. He 
was shaken out of his stasis by the intercom on the train crackling to 
life.

&quot;The next stop will be Tokyo-3 station,&quot; the canned voice said. &quot;Please 
wait until the train comes to a complete stop before gathering your 
belongings and exiting to the platform to the right. Thank you for 
traveling with us and we hope you enjoyed your trip.&quot;

&quot;Tokyo-3?&quot; Ranma mumbled in thought. &quot;This must be a dream. I&#39;m dreaming 
that I&#39;m in Evangelion. Great.&quot;

Ranma was very familiar with that anime. It was his favorite after all. 
That wasn&#39;t because he was particularly interested in mecha anime and 
stuff. It was mainly because the main character, Shinji Ikari had an 
even crappier life than Ranma. The pigtailed martial artist found it 
uplifting that someone could have it worse than him. It made his 
problems seem easier to deal with.

Still, it sure didn&#39;t feel like a dream. Everything was very detailed; 
the sights, the rocking of the train, even the smells seemed very real 
as the train ground to a halt with a screech of metal.

Ranma picked up the pack next to him and exited the train. A brief 
exploration of his belongings turned up a NERV ID card in the name of 
Ranma Ikari. The question of whether he still had his curse was answered 
by the fact that there was female underwear and feminine hygiene items 
in with his boxers and other clothes, which included a couple of gi, 
several athletic suits like the one he was currently wearing and 
thankfully no dresses.

Nodding to himself, he looked at the picture again. Knowing how the 
story went, he decided to for-go calling the number on it. There would 
be no line available anyway given the fact that there was about to be an 
angel attack. He could tell that things were following the timeline due 
to the fact that the streets were deserted.

Sure enough, a formation of attack choppers flew by overhead launching 
missiles. Soon a giant humanoid figure lurched into view, its lanky 
limbs lashing out to smack the helos out of the sky as it ignored the 
missiles and artillery fired at it.

Ranma suddenly back-flipped away as the burning wreckage of one of the 
helos slammed into the street in front of him. As the explosion knocked 
him flat, he felt the heat of the flames and the pain of the debris 
striking him, and Ranma began to seriously doubt this was a dream.

Ranma rolled away as a blue sports car came to a screeching halt, nearly 
running him over. He watched as the woman from the picture got out.

&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late,&quot; she chirped cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;m...&quot;

&quot;Captain Misato Katsuragi,&quot; Ranma interrupted, getting in the car, 
&quot;competent Tactical Operations Officer but a ditzy juicer when not in 
the middle of a battle.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Misato protested as she got back in the car.

&quot;Let&#39;s just go, Misato, before they drop that stupid N2 mine on the 
angel,&quot; Ranma said.

Misato looked at him strangely, but got the car in motion.

&quot;You are Ranma Ikari, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Misato asked hesitantly.

&quot;Yeah, I guess I am,&quot; Ranma sighed.

Misato nodded and turned back to driving like a maniac towards NERV. 
Meanwhile, Ranma began to think, something he was actually reasonably 
adept at when he chose to do so. He was thinking about whether or not he 
was stuck living out Shinji&#39;s story or if he could change things because 
of his knowledge and abilities. Recalling what was supposed to be 
happening next, he figured it would be a good time for an experiment.

Ranma looked over at the angel and sure enough, he caught sight of a 
large aircraft approaching. Looking up ahead, he grinned as he saw they 
were coming up to a short tunnel in the mountainside.

&quot;Hey, Misato, stop the car in that tunnel,&quot; Ranma instructed.

&quot;Huh? What? We have to get you back to headquarters,&quot; Misato protested.

&quot;Just do it, Misato, trust me,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Unless you want to make 57 
more payments on the junk heap this car is gonna be when it gets caught 
in the N2 blast they are about to set off.&quot;

&quot;How the hell do you know they are going to set off an N2 mine?&quot; Misato 
demanded.

&quot;&#39;Cause I saw the bomber comin&#39;, now stop the car dammit!&quot; Ranma snapped 
as they entered the tunnel.

Misato stopped the car but she wasn&#39;t buying Ranma&#39;s explanation.

&quot;How do you know they are dropping an N2 mine?&quot; Misato demanded.

Ranma laughed nervously, scratching the base of his pigtail.

&quot;Um...well...&quot; Ranma stalled, trying to come up with a believable 
excuse. &quot;W-what else would they be droppin&#39;. Nothin&#39; else has had any 
effect.&quot;

He smirked at her, proud to have navigated that pitfall. Misato gave him 
a suspicious look.

&quot;Look, we don&#39;t have time for this,&quot; she said, putting the car in gear. 
&quot;I have to get back to headquarters.&quot;

Just as she started to go, there was a bright flash followed by a huge 
blast wave seconds later. Misato gulped. Had they been out there when 
that happened the car would have been picked up and thrown, possibly 
killing them.

&quot;Alright, we can go now,&quot; Ranma said, giving her a smug look.

&quot;Well you don&#39;t have to get all cocky about it,&quot; Misato complained.

(oO\O/Oo)

Dr. Ritsuko Akagi wore a wicked little grin as she stood in the elevator 
watching Misato out of the corner of her eye. The dark-haired beauty was 
currently eyeing the Commander&#39;s son indignantly. Apparently, the boy 
had refused to take one step into the facility until Misato had Ritsuko 
paged to meet them at the parking garage. He had evidently caught wind 
of Misato&#39;s inability to navigate through the facility.

The boy, the Third Child, Ranma Ikari, was unaffected by the evil eye 
Misato was directing at him. He just stood there leaning against the 
wall of the elevator with his arms crossed over his chest and one foot 
on the wall looking very casual about the whole thing. It was all 
Ritsuko could do to keep from laughing out loud at her friend.

The blonde had known that Misato was planning on dazzling the boy by 
using her attractiveness to set his teenage hormones churning. However, 
much to Ritsuko&#39;s amusement, it seemed her plan had failed utterly and 
Ritsuko had a good idea as to why. There was a story about the Third 
Child that seemed preposterous except for it came from otherwise 
reliable sources. It was something that Ritsuko planned to confirm 
firsthand, and if it was true, something she very much wanted to study.

&quot;So, Ranma,&quot; Ritsuko said, shifting her furtive examination to the boy 
who looked more like a sixteen year-old than a fourteen year-old, &quot;I 
understand you have a rather peculiar...condition.&quot;

Her lips quirked into a smirk as she saw the boy stiffen in alarm.

&quot;Y-you might say that,&quot; Ranma said trying to recover. &#39;How the hell did 
they know about the curse?&#39;

&quot;I can&#39;t wait to see it in action,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;It sounds 
fascinating.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Ranma said sarcastically. &quot;I guess it would be if it was 
happenin&#39; to someone other than you.&quot;

&quot;Oh come now, surely it&#39;s not that bad,&quot; Ritsuko smiled.

&quot;Heh, what was I thinkin&#39;?&quot; Ranma sneered. &quot;Of course it&#39;s not that bad. 
Why, it&#39;s great fun to have people treat you like you&#39;re some kinda 
freak. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside when people practically 
run away from me as if it&#39;s contagious or somethin&#39;. But what&#39;s best of 
all is experiencin&#39; things that no guy has a right to every month. Yup, 
it&#39;s freakin&#39; wonderful. Everyone should have a &#39;condition&#39; like mine.&quot;

Ritsuko frowned a little. Perhaps she had hit on a sore spot. She could 
also tell now that Misato was burning with curiosity. As immature as her 
friend was sometimes, poor Ranma was bound to be the target of Misato&#39;s 
teasing once she found out.

&quot;Sorry, Ranma, I didn&#39;t realize,&quot; Ritsuko commented.

Ranma deflated some.

&quot;Don&#39;t sweat it, Doc,&quot; Ranma dismissed. &quot;I just get sick of people 
tellin&#39; me it&#39;s not that bad when they have no clue what I go through.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s not that bad?&quot; Misato chimed in, giving voice to her curiosity.

&quot;Forget it,&quot; Ranma snapped.

&quot;Ritsuko?&quot; Misato prompted, seeing that she wasn&#39;t going to get anything 
from Ranma.

&quot;You&#39;ll find out soon enough, I&#39;m sure, Misato,&quot; Ritsuko smirked.

Misato growled in frustration, a feeling she was becoming awfully 
familiar with since she picked up the Third Child.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;So this is the last hope of mankind, huh?&quot; Ranma asked, as he and the 
two women stood before the purple head of the Eva sitting in a pool of 
reddish fluid which Ranma knew to be LCL.

&quot;Correct,&quot; came a voice in reply.

Looking up, Ranma smirked as he saw the most evil bastard of all time 
standing in the window of a control room overlooking the cavernous 
chamber the Eva was kept in.

&quot;Oh look, it&#39;s a dick with ears,&quot; Ranma waved. &quot;How&#39;s it goin&#39;, Pop? 
Rape any children lately?&quot;

The pigtailed martial artist stifled a chuckle as Ritsuko and Misato 
goggled at him. If Ranma&#39;s comments affected him at all, he gave no 
indication of it.

&quot;Dr. Akagi, prepare Unit 01 for its new pilot, Ranma,&quot; Gendo said.

&quot;What?&quot; Misato squawked. &quot;It took Rei months to be able to sync with an 
Eva. You can&#39;t be thinking of sending Ranma out there to face the 
angel.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Misato,&quot; Ranma reassured her with a grin. &quot;He may be the 
poster child for Heartless Bastard Int&#39;l, but he&#39;s right; the angel has 
to be stopped and I&#39;m the only one available. Let&#39;s get somethin&#39; 
straight, Pop; I don&#39;t like you. I think you&#39;re an egomaniacal coward 
with a god complex and I intend to bust your balls every chance I get. 
But for now, I got a job to do and people to protect. I ain&#39;t doin&#39; this 
for you. I&#39;m doing it for those people out there.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma sat in the entry plug as it was inserted into the Eva. He was more 
than a bit curious as to what someone with his capabilities could do 
with the giant bio-mecha. He knew a lot of stuff about the Eva, but he 
realized after Misato&#39;s suspicious looks on the way to NERV that he had 
to be careful of what he revealed that he knew. If they had any inkling 
that he knew what he knew, they would try their best to make him quietly 
disappear.

&quot;Ranma, we will be flooding the entry plug with a fluid called LCL, or 
Link Connection Liquid,&quot; Dr. Akagi&#39;s voice came over the comm. &quot;The 
fluid helps to absorb impacts and oxygenates your Blood more quickly. 
Don&#39;t panic. Just breathe naturally. Your body breathed fluids for 9 
months so you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;You sure about that, Doc?&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;I mean, knowing Pop, he may 
have robbed morgues and put me together out of spare parts.&quot;

&quot;I doubt that, Ranma,&quot; Dr. Akagi replied, though Ranma could hear the 
smirk in her voice. &quot;Get ready.&quot;

Ranma sat quietly as the fluid filled the entry plug fairly quickly. As 
it covered his head, he expelled as much air from his lungs as he could 
and then took a deep breath. There was some mild discomfort as the LCL 
filled his lungs and the stuff tasted pretty bad, though not nearly as 
bad as Akane&#39;s cooking, but it performed as advertised.

&quot;Everything okay, Ranma?&quot; Dr. Akagi asked.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Ranma replied shortly.

&quot;Good,&quot; the doctor said pleasantly. &quot;We&#39;re initiating the start up 
procedures. You might feel a little disoriented but it will pass.&quot;

&quot;Gotcha,&quot; Ranma replied calmly.

Ranma could feel the various systems begin to power up. Suddenly a wave 
of vertigo passed over him as the nerve connections were made. Closing 
his eyes and concentrating he could feel a large field of ki all around 
him.

&quot;You&#39;ve reached synchronization, Ranma,&quot; Dr. Akagi said. &quot;You currently 
have a 59 percent sync ratio. Very impressive for you&#39;re first attempt.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Doc? I&#39;m going to try something,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Let me know what 
happens.&quot;

Ranma reached out with his ki and began to infuse it into the ki field 
around him using a similar technique to what Kuno and Mousse used to 
infuse their ki into their weapons. The Eva&#39;s ki began to react and soon 
they meshed with each other. Ranma began to sense the environment around 
the Eva. It wasn&#39;t quite like it was his own body; more like the senses 
were muted to an extent, but it was certainly there nonetheless.

Now what Ranma didn&#39;t know is that when the spell Gosenkugi cast created 
this world, it used the information from the anime videos and filled in 
the rest from Ranma&#39;s mind. So many of the details that were not 
specifically described in the anime were filled in according to Ranma&#39;s 
expectations. Most important of these was the fact that Ranma believed 
that if he were in the original main character&#39;s position, he could have 
made a difference in the ultimate outcome.

Thus things like Ranma being able to mesh his ki with the AT field of 
the Eva and achieving superior control of it, were simply that way 
because he expected them to be.

&quot;What did you just do?&quot; Dr. Akagi demanded. &quot;Your Sync Ratio just jumped 
up to 82 percent. That should be impossible for your first time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m using a martial arts technique,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;Once a martial 
artist gets to a certain level, he can infuse his ki into his weapons to 
make them stronger and give him better control over them, making them 
like an extension of his own body. I&#39;m using the same principle here, 
infusing my ki into the Eva.&quot;

&quot;What you are talking about isn&#39;t possible,&quot; Dr. Akagi said.

&quot;Sure, Doc, whatever you say,&quot; Ranma smirked. &quot;This is all just a dream 
and you didn&#39;t see my &#39;Sync Ratio&#39; jump up to where it is now. Anyway, 
don&#39;t we have an angel to smack down?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re moving you to the catapult now,&quot; Misato said.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Are you ready, Ranma?&quot; Misato asked after Unit 01 had been secured onto 
the catapult.

&quot;Fire away,&quot; Ranma&#39;s voice said cheerfully.

&quot;The kid&#39;s got big brass ones, doesn&#39;t he?&quot; Misato directed at her 
blonde friend.

&quot;Let&#39;s just hope he doesn&#39;t bite off more than he can chew,&quot; Ritsuko 
replied. Misato nodded.

&quot;Eva Launch!&quot; she commanded.

&quot;WHOOOO HAAAA!&quot; Ranma&#39;s voice came over the comm as the catapult shot 
him and the Eva up toward the surface.

The large monitors in the control room showed the catapult reach the 
surface and the doors open.

&quot;Okay, Ranma, we&#39;re releasing the locks. Take it easy. We just want you 
to concentrate on walking for now,&quot; Misato advised.

&quot;Heh, no problem,&quot; Ranma smirked.

Everyone gasped as the locks were released and the Eva leapt forward 
into what appeared to be some sort of martial arts stance facing the 
angel, which had paused to assess the newcomer. Its right leg was 
extended forward, left knee out to the side and bent, while its left arm 
was extended back and held high. Ranma had the Eva&#39;s progressive knife 
deployed and grasped in the Eva&#39;s right hand which was held forward and 
low.

Misato boggled at the level of control Ranma possessed. It defied logic 
how he could be so good with this being his first time piloting and Eva. 
The kid was a natural.

The angel decided that the threat had to be neutralized before it 
continued its mission and began to bum rush the purple Eva. Unit 01 
deftly sidestepped the rush, slashing the angel&#39;s torso with the prog 
knife while tripping the angel with a foot. The angel slammed down face 
first onto the street and slid into a building.

The stunned personnel in the control room watched as the purple Eva 
leapt high into the air and slammed down on the angel&#39;s back as it 
struggled to rise. The Eva shifted its grip on the prog knife and 
plunged it down into the angel&#39;s unprotected back, driving through its 
AT field and piercing its core. Its struggles ceased.

&quot;Man, that almost wasn&#39;t fair,&quot; Ranma commented. &quot;It was like fighting 
an untrained thug.&quot;

With a flourish, the prog knife was stowed and the Eva stood up. It had 
just turned to move back to the cat when the angel blew up in a violent 
explosion centered on a giant cross-shaped flash of energy. Unit 01 was 
slammed face first into a building by the blast.

&quot;Ranma!&quot; Misato yelled. &quot;Ranma, are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Owwie,&quot; came a muzzy groan over the comm. &quot;That didn&#39;t feel too good.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s okay,&quot; Ritsuko informed them. &quot;His AT field absorbed most of the 
blast. Minor damage to the Eva&#39;s armor.&quot;

&quot;Send out the recovery teams,&quot; Misato ordered.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Okay, Ranma, you can get dressed,&quot; Ritsuko allowed. &quot;I must say you are 
in very good condition. If I didn&#39;t know any better, I would say you are 
a couple years older than 14. I guess with all the training you&#39;ve done, 
your musculature has matured a little faster than normal.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Ranma shrugged.

He wasn&#39;t about to tell her he was actually 17. Besides, if he recalled 
correctly that Toji guy looked just as old as he did.

&quot;I find it fascinating that your other form is completely functional,&quot; 
Ritsuko went on. &quot;How long have you been having menses?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ranma asked in confusion.

&quot;When did you start having a period?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;Oh, well, I guess it was shortly after I got the curse,&quot; Ranma said, 
blushing. &quot;I went to change back and I couldn&#39;t. Then I started 
bleeding. I thought I had some kind of internal injuries or something 
until someone explained to me what was happening. God, I&#39;ve never been 
so embarrassed.&quot;

Ritsuko giggled.

&quot;If it makes you feel any better, Ranma, we are all embarrassed by that 
particular right of passage,&quot; she said reassuringly. &quot;It&#39;s interesting 
that while your female form seems to be...well developed, it seems a 
little closer to what one might expect of a 14 year old. Still, both 
forms are as healthy as your namesake in spite of the scarring and 
evidence of broken bones.&quot;

&quot;The life of a martial artist is fraught with peril,&quot; Ranma quoted with 
a wry grin.

&quot;I can see that,&quot; Ritsuko commented. &quot;It also has some pretty 
unbelievable pay-offs apparently. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen someone 
who was able to run twenty miles in an hour and not break a sweat.&quot;

&quot;Most people aren&#39;t stupid enough to go through the kind of training I 
was put through,&quot; Ranma quipped.

&quot;I see,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;So tell me more about this &#39;ki&#39; you say you 
use.&quot;

&quot;Heh, not much to tell really,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It&#39;s basically the life 
energy produced by all living things. With lots of training to build it 
up, you can use your will to focus it to strengthen your body, or 
increase your speed, or even infuse it into a weapon. I knew a guy that 
could focus his ki into a bokken so that he could slash through tree 
trunks like they were warm butter and another that could make cloth as 
rigid and sharp as steel.&quot;

&quot;Fascinating,&quot; Ritsuko said with a raised eyebrow. &quot;So what can you do?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not too good with the iron cloth technique, but I can infuse my ki 
into a weapon,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll look forward to seeing the extent of your abilities. That 
was some very impressive piloting you did out there today,&quot; Ritsuko 
said. &quot;Wait here and I&#39;ll have someone show you where the cafeteria is. 
I guess you&#39;re probably hungry.&quot;

The mention of food caused Ranma&#39;s stomach to roar in approval. Ritsuko 
gave him a little smile and Ranma blushed.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;The third Child certainly doesn&#39;t seem as...passive...as you had 
hoped,&quot; Sub-commander Fuyutsuki observed.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Gendo Ikari nodded from behind his steepled hands. &quot;It seems my 
fool of a cousin that I paid to take him on that training trip failed to 
break the boy. It&#39;s amazing really. The boy must have an incredibly 
strong will to have survived the insane things Cousin Genma subjected 
him too. Not even the Nekoken training or that ridiculous curse has 
managed to break the boy&#39;s spirit.&quot;

&quot;What will you do?&quot; Fuyutsuki asked. &quot;Your plans called for him to be 
weak-willed and controllable.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s of no consequence,&quot; Gendo said. &quot;Rei will do as she is told when 
the time comes. If the boy becomes a threat before then, we shall have 
to remove him. Until then he is still useful to us as a pilot.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;That was SO weird,&quot; Misato said, looking through the file Ritsuko 
handed her. &quot;The kid is one hell of a pilot, but he&#39;s got some serious 
issues.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ritsuko agreed. &quot;He&#39;s definitely a mass of contradictions. His 
intelligence and problem-solving scores are nearly off the chart, but he 
has atrocious math, science, and social skills. Probably because of the 
fact he was raised on the road most of his life with very limited 
contact with other people besides this Genma Saotome who trained him.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I can understand why the kid doesn&#39;t like the Commander after 
leaving him to be raised by that sadistic idiot Genma,&quot; Misato said, 
while leafing through the reports of Ranma&#39;s childhood. &quot;If the 
Commander knew some of this stuff was happening, why did he allow it to 
happen? I mean, some of this stuff is nothing but inhuman torture.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure the Commander has his reasons,&quot; Ritsuko said. &quot;It certainly 
seemed to pay off in Ranma&#39;s ability to pilot an Eva.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give you that,&quot; Misato allowed. &quot;The kid is amazing.&quot;

&quot;Oh, by the way, do you think you could drop him off on your way home?&quot; 
Ritsuko asked.

&quot;He&#39;s not staying with the Commander?&quot; Misato asked.

Ritsuko just raised an eyebrow and gave her a &#39;you must be joking&#39; look.

&quot;Oh, right, he hates his father,&quot; Misato said, chagrinned. &quot;So where&#39;s 
he staying?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s been assigned to an apartment in the same building as Rei&#39;s,&quot; 
Ritsuko supplied.

&quot;What? In that slum?&quot; Misato demanded. &quot;All by himself?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Is that a problem?&quot; Ritsuko asked.

&quot;Absolutely,&quot; Misato announced. &quot;He can stay with me.&quot;

&quot;Really, Misato,&quot; Ritsuko said in a teasing tone, &quot;while I admit he&#39;s 
cute, he&#39;s a 14 year old kid. I hardly think it would be appropriate for 
you to bed him.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Misato screeched. &quot;That&#39;s NOT what I had in mind! The poor kid 
has never had anyone but that worthless waste of skin, Genma to look 
after him. I just think he should see that everyone is not like that.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Ritsuko said, raising an eyebrow dubiously.

&quot;Whatever, Ritsuko,&quot; Misato dismissed. &quot;Where is he, so I can get him?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s in the cafeteria,&quot; Ritsuko smiled knowingly.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Welcome to your new home, Ranma,&quot; Misato announced cheerfully as she 
opened the door.

Ranma shot her a wry glance, knowing what he was going to see upon 
entering the condo. He walked in, but even knowing what a slob Misato 
was didn&#39;t prepare him for the experience. Sure enough, there were piles 
of empty beer cans and instant food containers strewn across the tables, 
counters, and floors. He expected that. What sent him reeling though was 
the smell.

&quot;Gah!&quot; Ranma twitched.

&quot;Sorry about the mess,&quot; Misato said apologetically. &quot;I haven&#39;t had time 
to straighten up.&quot;

Ranma looked at her incredulously. She said that as if there were just a 
few magazines not stacked up and a glass or two left out.

&quot;This place is a pig sty,&quot; Ranma proclaimed. &quot;And it reeks like the 
inside of a bar the next morning. Geez, Misato, I knew you were a slob 
but this is just disgusting.&quot;

By now, Misato&#39;s eyebrow was twitching and she was glaring at Ranma.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you somethin&#39; else too,&quot; Ranma stated. &quot;Once we get this dump 
cleaned up and habitable, don&#39;t expect me to clean up after ya all the 
time. I don&#39;t mind doing the cookin&#39; since obviously that&#39;s most likely 
the only way I&#39;d get a decent meal around here, but you&#39;re doing the 
dishes right after dinner. We can trade off cleanin&#39; the bathroom and 
cleanin&#39; the house. You take care of your own laundry. If I&#39;m gonna live 
here, I ain&#39;t gonna be your maid, got it?&quot;

Misato could only stand there with her eye twitching as the pigtailed 
boy picked up his pack and went down the hall to pick out a room.

(oO\O/Oo)

Nabiki paused the tape as the credits began to roll at the end of the 
first episode.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi remarked.

&quot;That&#39;s Ranma, alright, blunt as ever,&quot; Nabiki said in wonder. &quot;Anyone 
have any idea what this means?&quot;

&quot;It seems obvious to me that someone has used some sort of banishing 
spell to send Ranma into the world depicted on these tapes,&quot; Cologne 
said.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, but for Ranma, that makes sense,&quot; 
Nabiki agreed.

&quot;We have to get him out of there,&quot; Akane insisted.

&quot;Really, Akane, showing concern for your fianc&eacute;?&quot; Nabiki teased.

&quot;You know how Evangelion ends Nabiki,&quot; Akane said. &quot;He may be a jerk but 
even he doesn&#39;t deserve that.&quot;

&quot;You are familiar with this story?&quot; Cologne asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Akane said, Nabiki nodding. &quot;In the end everyone dies and the 
world is destroyed. That guy Gendo is manipulating everyone so he can 
play God and bring back his dead wife and he doesn&#39;t care if the whole 
human race has to die as long as he reaches his goals.&quot;

Everyone at the table except Akane and Nabiki, being the only two that 
had seen the anime, paled. Soun began wailing about the schools never 
being joined and Genma began to lament about how his dishonorable son 
was foolish enough to get caught in a spell that sent him to a world 
that slandered his own father so.

&quot;So how we get Airen back, Great Grandmother?&quot; Shampoo asked.

Everyone looked at Cologne expectantly. The matriarch sighed heavily.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Cologne said tiredly. &quot;Firstly, we have no idea what 
spell was used to send him there. Secondly, chances are we would 
probably not be able to reverse it if we did. Depending on the spell 
used, a summoning spell might work to get Son-in-law back, but the risk 
would be severe and it wouldn&#39;t be possible unless we knew what spell 
was used to begin with.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re saying there&#39;s nothing we can do?&quot; Ukyo demanded.

&quot;It is possible that after things run their course that Son-in-law will 
return to this world,&quot; Cologne said, but added, &quot;if he lives through 
it.&quot;

&quot;So all we can do is watch and hope?&quot; Nabiki asked.

&quot;What hope is there?&quot; Akane said morosely. &quot;You&#39;ve seen the anime.&quot;

&quot;But Ranma is not Shinji, Akane,&quot; Nabiki said. &quot;You saw how easily he 
handled the third angel right out of the box. Also, this was his 
favorite anime. He knows what&#39;s going on so he might be able to change 
the outcome.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe that jerk thinks LCL tastes better than my cooking,&quot; 
Akane growled, being reminded of Ranma&#39;s first time in an Eva.

&quot;The biggest problem I see is that to change things, he&#39;s going to need 
allies,&quot; Nabiki observed. &quot;And we all know how good Ranma is at making 
friends.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe Ranma-honey has a period,&quot; Ukyo remarked. &quot;I wonder who 
explained things to him?&quot;

Nabiki looked at Kasumi, who blushed.

&quot;Figures Nice-girl be the one,&quot; Shampoo said. &quot;Shampoo no like Airen 
living with purple-haired slut.&quot;

This caused nearly everyone at the table to sweat-drop and someone 
muttered something about pots and kettles being black.

&quot;He better not do anything perverted with those floozies,&quot; Akane 
declared.

&quot;Really, Akane, jealous of an anime character?&quot; Nabiki drawled. &quot;I can&#39;t 
wait for him to meet Asuka. She&#39;s a dead ringer for his girl form and 
her personality is exactly the same as his; arrogant, conceited, always 
insisting she&#39;s the best while trying to hide the fact that she&#39;s 
insecure. She&#39;s going to hate his guts.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make some tea and snacks,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Everyone can use the 
bathroom if they need to and then we can watch some more.&quot;

&quot;Good idea, Child,&quot; Cologne agreed.</pre>
