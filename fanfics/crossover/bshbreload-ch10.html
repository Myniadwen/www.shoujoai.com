<a href="../crossover/bshbreload-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Wakaba looked at the blonde in surprise, &quot;Kiryuu-san?&quot;

&quot;Call me Nanami,&quot; she corrected her as she gently
guided Anthy and Wakaba down the hallway. &quot;The student
council office should be empty now,&quot; she explained,
&quot;we can use that to talk about the vampires.&quot;

&quot;How do you know about...?&quot; Anthy frowned, her eyes
flashing.

Nanami used her key to unlock the room then ushered
them inside, re-locking it behind them. &quot;That&#39;s
better,&quot; she nodded before looking towards Anthy and
explaining, &quot;Utena-sama saved me from an attack, of
course.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Wakaba sighed in resignation. She shook
her hear, &quot;I almost wish Utena could do that
vampire-whammy on people.&quot;

&quot;Vampire-whammy?&quot; Anthy looked amused.

&quot;Tampering with people&#39;s minds,&quot; Wakaba explained, &quot;I
heard that Akio and a few others like Juri could do it
to people.&quot;

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Nanami waved that aside as she asked, &quot;why
hasn&#39;t this sort of information been spread around the
school?&quot;

&quot;Do you really think most people are going to believe
it?&quot; Wakaba countered. She sighed softly, &quot;Besides,
what can telling people do other than cause a panic?&quot;

&quot;They could protect themselves!&quot; Nanami burst out.

Anthy looked over at her with gentle sorrow as she
explained, &quot;It&#39;s not that easy, Kiryuu-san. I have
fought against vampres, and most of the traditional
&#39;defences&#39; against vampires like crosses and garlic
are just myths, nothing more. Vampires can&#39;t enter
uninvited, true, and they can die from a stake to the
heart, but that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;And sunlight,&quot; Wakaba reminded her.

&quot;A strong enough vampire can even overcome that,&quot;
Anthy said grimly.

Nanami... deflated a bit, puffing out a sigh. &quot;I&#39;m
sorry,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;I&#39;m still trying to digest
everything I&#39;ve found out recently.&quot; She walked over
to a round table, one usually used for meetings, and
sat down with a sigh. Refering to the conversatio she
had interupted earlier she asked, &quot;You were talking
about searching for a vampire?&quot;

&quot;Kiryuu-san, I can&#39;t really involve you in...&quot; Anthy
started.

&quot;I&#39;m already involved in this,&quot; Nanami answered, eyes
flashing with anger as she clearly tried to restrain
her emotions.

&quot;And that sounds very good coming from you,&quot; Wakaba
muttered, &quot;comnsidering you were threatening to bring
Kozue into this.&quot;

&quot;Kozue knows too?&quot; Nanami blinked.

&quot;Another Utena rescue,&quot; Wakaba explained.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Nanami nodded.

Anthy rubbed between her eyes, feeling a big headache
coming on. &quot;God save me from well meaning amatures,&quot;
she muttered.

Wakaba gave Anthy a wary look, &quot;You said that some
vampires can manage in daylight, so isn&#39;t it dangerous
for us to investigate where the vampires are?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not afraid,&quot; Nanami answered softly.

&quot;You should be,&quot; Anthy frowned, disturbed by a sudden
flash of memory...

London, several years ago.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re investigating this rumor,&quot;
Constance &#39;Contrary&#39; Terry said, the redhead sweeping
the street with her eyes. She walked with confidence,
the tall athlete cutting through the crowded street
easily in her comfortable clothes.

Dressed in a similar baggy sweatshirt and jeans Anthy
worked to keep up, lugging a slightly larger than
average shoulder bag. &quot;There&#39;s been several bloodless
bodies found by the Thames,&quot; she frowned, &quot;all of them
associated with this club.&quot;

&quot;Club?&quot; Contrary scoffed, &quot;You mean a brothel.&quot;

&quot;The Commander thinks it&#39;s worth while to
investigate,&quot; Anthy said firmly.

Contrary nodded slightly, her green eyes softening a
bit. The young woman had been a long time member of
the Royal Order, and had been assigned to mentor Anthy
as she was being trained. They had clashed at first,
personalities warring, but the young lady had quickly
sensed her commitment, which helped a lot.

They reached the converted brownstone, both of them
watching the nearly silent building thoughtfully. &quot;So
how would you recomend we do this?&quot; she asked Anthy
curiously, looking at her with a calculating
expression.

Anthy didn&#39;t hesitate, &quot;First, check for other exists
and access ways. If possible we go in through the
front door, generating as much chaos as we can to
disrupt their attemps to defend the building, then
find the vampires.&quot;

&quot;How are you armed?&quot; Contrary asked Anthy, though she
likely already knew the answers already. Still, as the
senior field agent she had to check.

&quot;Magnum loaded with blessed silver bullets,&quot; Anthy
replied promptly, &quot;along with several wooden stakes in
reserve.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Contrary patted the shoulder bag she
carried. She lead the way out of the corner they were
talking in as she continued to say, &quot;We&#39;ll split up
once we go inside, you get to take the upstairs and
I&#39;ll check down.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s against standard procedure...,&quot; Anthy started.

&quot;At best there&#39;s one vampire, considering how few
bodies have been found,&quot; Contrary said to her
confidently, &quot;we can handle it.&quot; She flashed a grin,
&quot;Besides we&#39;ve got radios, we can call out for help if
it&#39;s needed.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Anthy nodded reluctantly, defering to the
more experienced agent. Together they quickly
confirmed there was only one door in or out, and that
the windows on the lower level were sealed, intended
for the look of the building rather than for practical
use.

Contrary tried the front door, and finding it unlocked
they strode inside, scaning the dim inner hallway.
Drawing her pistol from the bag she checked the black
painted weapon over even as she said, &quot;The plans show
the up stairway is over there, good luck.&quot;

&quot;You too,&quot; Anthy nodded as she headed up the hall to
the stairs. She went up to the second floor and began
to open doors, checking for any signs of the vampire
or vampires.

The six rooms on the top floor each contained a
comfortable bed, decorated in a simple but stylish
short of way. Laying on the beds and sleeping so
deeply that one might think they were in comas were
lovely young women, the clean scent coming from them
telling her that they were still uncorrupted by a
vampire&#39;s touch.

On the first floor there were fewer rooms, and all of
them were empty. &#39;He&#39;s not here,&#39; she felt a stab of
worry as Anthy walked to the stairs going down, &#39;which
means the vampire is in the sub-basements just or not
here.&#39;

Just then, a cry rang out.

Swearing under her breath Anthy bolted, racig forward
down the hall... and into a scene from her nightmares.
Contrary was dead or as good as, held in the arms of a
older male vampire. He tore his mouth from her bloody
neck, fluid dripping and grinned at her.

&quot;Well, another for the party,&quot; he laughed, jeans and
t-shirt wet with blood. Another body lay slumped
nearby, drained messily much like Contrary had been.
He tossed the still weakly moaning woman aside and
fixed her with a intense gaze, &quot;You&#39;ll be easier than
her.&quot;

Part of Anthy wanted to make a speech, to condemn the
creature ahead of her... but she knew better. Without
hesitation she drew and fired, punching her first
bullet right into the startled vampires face. Part of
his skull exploded, red gore splatting the walls as
his body staggered, still vital even with the damage.
Her next two shots destroyed the heart and the vampire
dropped, a wet sack of meat.

&quot;Contrary,&quot; Anthy ran to the young woman&#39;s side,
lookig down at her in agonized horror.

&quot;Good job, newbie,&quot; Contrary managed, her skin bone
pale and eyes filled with pain.

Anthy knelt down, cradling Contrary&#39;s head in her lap
as she softly said, &quot;I&#39;ll get an ambulance, you&#39;ll be
all right.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Contrary managed, &quot;I&#39;m already contaminated. The
wound&#39;s too bad....&quot; She winced in pain, &quot;Promise me
you&#39;ll make sure I don&#39;t rise.&quot;

&quot;Constance, I can&#39;t....&quot; Anthy managed.

Contrary grabbed her hand with the last of her
strength, &quot;Promise!&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Anthy said, eyes swimming with tears,
&quot;we&#39;ll cremate your body.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Contrary slumped, her eyes drooping closed.


Back at the student council both young women looked at
her in concern. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Wakaba asked
reluctantly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Anthy said, deliberately setting the memories
aside. She looked at both young women as she added, &quot;I
was just reminded that working alone on this job is
dangerously foolish.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll let me help?&quot; Nanami asked eagerly.

&quot;If you&#39;ll agree to follow my orders,&quot; a serious Anthy
agreed, &quot;I want to do everything I can to keep you
safe.&quot;</pre>
