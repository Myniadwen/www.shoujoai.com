<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 15 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/supergirl-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>        The science lab was one of the largest sections in the 
Watchtower, a several stories tall facility filled with technology from 
several different generations of the Justice League. There were pieces 
of Thangarian equipment provided by Hawkman, Martian artifacts, 
Kryptonian robotics, New Genesis technology, and more human creations as 
well. Some of John Henry Iron&#39;s Steel gear was enshrined in one part, 
Batman&#39;s security gear in another, pieces of interface equipment 
designed by Oracle herself, and dozens of other things.

        Of course, now that B-ko had moved on in, there was an increased 
bent towards types of mecha. Several combat suits were in various states 
of assembly or dismantling, while schematics covered the bottom of one 
wall, spilled over a desk, and then spreading out onto the floor. Along 
with the various armors were robots, some quite human, some not, 
including the machine that B-ko was showing Oracle now.

        &quot;You.. finished it already?&quot; the Oracle hologram looked at the 
robot in shock.

        &quot;Not entirely finished,&quot; a smiling B-ko modestly corrected her, 
&quot;I&#39;ve just completed the core systems and started on the outer shell. We 
still have to customize the appearance and finish fitting it to your 
tastes.&quot;

        Oracle shook her head in admiration as she gazed at the robotic 
body that B-ko had built of her. Sheathed in metallic silver, it was 
human sized and proportioned, dangling from the ceiling via several 
different connecting cables. While physically appearing to be female 
it&#39;s features were only roughly sketched in, waiting further data before 
being finished off.

        &quot;It&#39;s remarkable,&quot; Oracle said softly.

        &quot;Want to try it out?&quot; B-ko offered.

        Oracle looked at her in surprise, &quot;I can?&quot;

        &quot;The wireless connection to the Watchtower mainframe&#39;s already 
been established,&quot; B-ko shrugged, &quot;you just need to activate it.&quot;

        The Oracle hologram flickered, then disappeared as the 
processing power was diverted to the new tasks. The robot&#39;s eyes 
twitched, it&#39;s limbs tensing up, then a bit jerkily the head rose, 
looking all around her curiously.

        The voice was a bit rough, but it even sounded like Oracle as 
she said, &quot;I can actually feel the air circulating against my skin. How 
did you manage that degree of sensitivity?&quot;

        &quot;By studying both the Tomorrow Woman and Amazo androids,&quot; B-ko 
admitted, &quot;though I&#39;d like to think I made some improvements on the 
technology.&quot; Oracle&#39;s new body staggered a bit, and the blue haired 
scientist reached out to grab her arm, bringing a soft gasp from her. 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked worriedly.

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Oracle tried to smile, but the artificial face 
wasn&#39;t quite able to yet, &quot;it just startled me a bit, the feeling of 
skin against my own.&quot;

        &quot;I guess it&#39;s been a long time,&quot; B-ko mused. She smiled 
slightly, &quot;Have you decided on how you want to look, yet?&quot;

        &quot;I think so,&quot; Oracle agreed. She disengaged from the robot&#39;s 
mind and it went limp once again. The hologram appeared then morphed 
slightly, taking on the appearance Barbara had possessed as a teen, 
&quot;What do you think?&quot;

        &quot;Looks pretty good,&quot; B-ko agreed, circling the auburn haired 
young woman thoughtfully. &quot;Just download a holo of this form onto my 
hard drive in here, and I should have the body ready in two or three 
days,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Oracle smiled at her happily.

        &quot;What are teammates for?&quot; B-ko grinned. She looked at her 
chronometer and visibly paled, &quot;Oh hell, I&#39;m late!&quot; She bolted right out 
of the room, leaving Oracle looking after her curiously.

        A few moments later B-ko skidded to a stop in front of the 
teleporter tubes, where a smiling Helena Wayne waited. &quot;Just in time,&quot; 
the black haired woman offered.

        &quot;I&#39;m late,&quot; B-ko bowed nervously, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Helena smiled. She hesitated, looking down at 
B- ko&#39;s slightly greasy clothes, &quot;You aren&#39;t going out like that, are 
you?&quot;

        With a smile B-ko touched a switch on her slim silver wristband 
and her greasy cover-alls shimmered, then they were gone. In it&#39;s place, 
she now wore a stylish woman&#39;s business suit in blue. &quot;Is this better?&quot; 
B-ko asked.

        &quot;How...&quot; Helena blinked, then shook her head. &quot;Never mind, I 
probably wouldn&#39;t understand the explanation anyway,&quot; she grinned. She 
looked over at B-ko, &quot;A-ko, Iris and Kyla are all in the training 
center, sparring.&quot;

        &quot;Hopefully not as roughly as A-ko and I do,&quot; B-ko smiled.

        &quot;They&#39;re the kids of the JLA,&quot; Helena grinned, &quot;of course they 
play nice.&quot;

        B-ko gave her a thoughtful look, &quot;I rather doubt that you play 
nice.&quot;

        &quot;Neither did Batman,&quot; Helena answered with a grin.

        They stepped into the teleporters together, the tubes closing 
around them to seal off any outside interference. There was a soft hum, 
a sudden sense of displacement, and the two young women reappeared on a 
rooftop in Gotham City.

        Gotham stretched out in front of them, a mass of contradictions. 
Buildings as old as the city itself rose up beside towers of glass and 
steel. Slums that were some of the worst in the country, beside fenced 
districts of the rich and powerful. It was a paradox, Gotham City, a 
place often likened to a powderkeg just about to go off.

        &quot;It&#39;s... interesting,&quot; B-ko managed.

        Helena smiled as she admitted, &quot;It does has it&#39;s charms, but you 
pretty much have to be a resident to discover them.&quot;

        &quot;Then I look forward to being educated,&quot; B-ko smiled back 
impishly. Helena led the way to a stairway, leading down into a nice 
apartment building. As they went down the hallway she asked, &quot;So where 
are we going?&quot;

        &quot;Just here,&quot; Helena was about to use her key when she noticed it 
was open. &quot;I guess they&#39;re home,&quot; she smiled back at B-ko.

        &#39;They?&#39; B-ko wondered nervously.

        The blonde who came out of the kitchen was older, but looked 
healthy and vigorous none the less. Blue eyes twinkled as she took in 
Helena and B- ko and asked, &quot;What did I tell you about bringing strange 
girls home with you?&quot;

        &quot;B-ko&#39;s not that strange,&quot; Helena said dryly. She turned back to 
B- ko, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet my adopted mother, Dinah Lance-Gordon.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s an honor to meet you,&quot; B-ko shook the offered hand, 
recognizing the woman from the JLA files as Black Canary.

        A redhead walked in after her, walking cautiously with a set of 
mechanical leg braces. &quot;And this is my other adopted mother,&quot; Helena 
smiled, &quot;Barbara Gordon-Lance.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s very nice to meet you,&quot; B-ko managed nervously as she 
silently considered the many ways she could get back at Helena for doing 
this to her without any warning.

        Very quietly Helena whispered, &quot;I didn&#39;t realize they&#39;d be 
home.&quot;

        &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; B-ko managed to quietly answer.
