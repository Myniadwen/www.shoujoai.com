<h1>The New Adventures of Supergirl (part 19 of 42)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/supergirl-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>        Once it had been Belle Reeve, a prison situated in the Louisiana 
swamps, that had been dedicated to holding the supervillains. Outside 
Gotham stood Arkham Asylum, the most mad and deranged villains contained 
in it&#39;s high walls. Iron Heights held the supercriminals of Keystone and 
Central City, the Rogues Gallery of the Flash. As the years passed many 
facilities closed, criminals were shifted around, and ultimately a new 
prison was created.

        The Fortress was a massive construction, taller than some 
skyscrapers and equipped with the most advanced restraint technologies 
available. Fifty floors tall, a mile across, and descending into the 
Earth it was the holding ground for those superhumans that chose to 
violate the law. There had never been a successful jail break there... 
but there was always a first time.

        &quot;Care to play a game, officer?&quot; the redheaded woman in gambling 
gear asked as she was lead down the row of glass fronted cells, looking 
almost like a casino girl.

        &quot;Sorry, Roulette,&quot; the young man said, &quot;your probability 
shifting powers won&#39;t work with those dampers on.&quot; He nodded to the 
wristbands she wore, gleaming silver in the artificial light.

        &quot;You can&#39;t blame a girl for trying,&quot; Roulette shrugged.

        &quot;Here we are,&quot; a glass barrier slid up silently and she was 
pushed forward into the little cell. Sounding like he gave the speech 
regularly he continued on, &quot;You&#39;ll get your meals through the wall 
compartment at six a.m., noon, and eight p.m. You get two hours 
community time out of the cells with the power dampers active around two 
p.m.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Roulette gave him a cheerful wave as he left. She 
stalked over to where a bed was set up against one wall and sat down 
with a thump. Softly, so that it could barely be heard she seemed to ask 
herself, &quot;Now what?&quot;

        The voice rang in the woman&#39;s mind, not heard so much as felt. 
&quot;Well done, little one,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice said, &quot;now you have but to 
wait.&quot;

        &quot;Who am I looking for, exactly?&quot; Roulette murmured softly.

        &quot;Metallix, Scarecrow, Vox, Obsidian and the Enchantress,&quot; the 
soft voice vibrated in her mind, &quot;to begin with.&quot;

        &quot;I thought Obsidian was purely a second stringer?&#39; Roulette 
asked.

        &quot;He possesses a connection to the old League,&quot; the voice 
explained softly, &quot;something that could make them hesitate at a critical 
moment.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Roulette agreed. She lay back on the mattress, 
tucking her arms behind her head, &quot;Hope this plan of yours works, lady. 
I don&#39;t want to serve out that sentence.&quot;

        &quot;It will,&quot; the voice answered simply, then it was gone.

        The morning went by quietly, Roulette working out in her cell 
between her meals. Two p.m. finally rolled around and the door slid up 
on her and many other cells, releasing the captives that were normally 
held within. Roulette walked out, studying the figures nearby.

        Most of the normal prisoners were dressed in the standard orange 
jumpsuits, but all the super-criminals were dressed in their distinctive 
costumes. &#39;Guess it makes us stand out a bit more,&#39; Roulette noted, &#39;so 
the guards can spot us easier.&#39; She looked around, feeling a bit of awe 
at some of the beings who were imprisoned there.

        The Cyborg shuffled by in a primitive looking robotic body, the 
being who had nearly slain Superman brought so low. There was the mad 
god called Gog, whom the entire JLA had barely been able to defeat. 
Parallax, the being composed of pure temporal energy and master of time. 
Piper, the fey madman who had slain his predecessor for the sound 
technology. They were there, and dozens of others, the best of the 
worst.

        &#39;Enough hero worship,&#39; Roulette thought, &#39;time to get to work.&#39; 
She scanned the crowd, looking for her targets, and spotted one after a 
few moments of wandering.

        The butchy looking blonde looked intense as she watched the 
crowd, a metallic circlet closed around her neck. The black clad woman 
saw Roulette approaching her and tilted her head to the side, waiting 
until she got near. There was a rasp to her voice, &quot;What do you want?&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re Vox?&quot; Roulette asked her. A slight smile teased her lips 
as she continued on, &quot;You&#39;re Allison Queen, is that right?&quot;

        A muscle jumped in Vox&#39;s neck, &quot;Don&#39;t mention that name.&quot;

        &quot;You don&#39;t like your parents very much,&quot; Roulette said quietly, 
&quot;Dinah Lance or... him. How&#39;d you like the chance to do them some real 
damage?&quot;

        &quot;In here?&quot; Vox looked around the prison block, &quot;Don&#39;t make me 
laugh.&quot;

        &quot;And if I could get you out of here?&quot; Roulette asked.

        &quot;I&#39;d kill both of them for free,&quot; Vox said with a cold little 
smile.

        &quot;I&#39;ll contact you,&quot; Roulette said simply. &#39;For a professional 
hitwoman, offering to kill her parents for free is a hell of a thing,&#39; 
she mused.

        It took until the next day for Roulette to find another one of 
her targets. It was the soft whimpers of fear that drew Roulette towards 
her, hidden away in a corner of the massive prison. The girl tried to 
dig herself deeper into the corner, soft sounds of terror coming from 
her throat as the figure dressed in medical whites gazed on 
thoughtfully.

        &quot;How on Earth did you manage to sneak in any of your fear 
chemicals?&quot; a wary Roulette asked her curiously.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t,&quot; the black haired woman flashed a smile, &quot;it seems 
this poor dear has a phobia about doctors.&quot; She turned from the girl to 
look at Roulette thoughtfully. &quot;What do you want with me,&quot; she asked, 
&quot;what do you want from the Scarecrow?&quot;

        &quot;I understand that Kestrel stopped your experiments in emotion 
manipulation in Gotham City,&quot; Roulette said softly. &quot;I&#39;m impressed with 
your research, so much so that I want to let you experiment on a much 
larger scale.&quot;

        &quot;How much larger?&quot; Scarecrow asked, the fear struck girl trying 
to crawl away. She let the child go, her gaze focused on Roulette.

        &quot;The entire country,&quot; Roulette said softly, &quot;possibly the 
world.&quot;

        Scarecrow nodded slightly. &quot;If you can get me out of this 
place,&quot; she smiled madly, &quot;as entertaining as it might be, I would be 
most interested.&quot;

        &quot;Wait and see,&quot; Roulette said.

        Obsidian was just a waste of her time, a figure clothed in 
shadows huddled fearfully in the corner of his cell. Still, there was 
something in his eyes... Roulette got the feeling that all hell would 
break loose if he was ever taken out of the influence of those power 
dampers.

        &quot;You get me out of here,&quot; Metallix had smiled, the teenaged 
woman&#39;s living metal form gleaming, &quot;and I&#39;ll do whatever you want.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t want much,&quot; Roulette said with a smile.

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Metallix looked curious.

        &quot;Just as much chaos as you can generate,&quot; Roulette laughed as 
she strode away.

        Her final stop was near the top of the Fortress, a cell set 
apart from all the others. It was partially to protect the other 
prisoners, and in part it was to protect her. The figure wore a green 
cloak that swirled around her, black hair flowing down her back.

        &quot;What do you want?&quot; the woman asked.

        &quot;Enchantress,&quot; Roulette said, &quot;or would you prefer if I call you 
Zatanna?&quot;

        &quot;Zatanna is dead,&quot; the former heroine looked at Roulette with 
dead eyes, &quot;only the Enchantress remains. Speak.&quot;

        &quot;The Justice League failed you in allowing the dark spirit to 
possess you,&quot; Roulette chose her words carefully, &quot;then betrayed you by 
locking you away here instead of seeking a cure.&quot;

        &quot;The League&#39;s sins are many,&quot; Enchantress said coldly, &quot;and I 
would make them pay for each and every one of them.&quot; A little pause, 
&quot;Sadly, we are all held here.&quot;

        &quot;That might not be a permanent condition,&quot; Roulette said. 
Silently she thought, &#39;This plan of yours had better work.&#39;

        &#39;It will, child,&#39; the woman&#39;s voice was warm, &#39;and you will be 
rewarded once we arrive.&#39;

        &quot;Your magic could tear this place down if the dampers stopped 
working, right?&quot; Roulette asked the Enchantress aloud.

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Enchantress nodded gravely.

        &quot;My power is to manipulate probabilities,&quot; Roulette smiled, 
&quot;like the chance my dampers might fail completely.&quot; She stripped her 
wristbands off, holding her hands up above her head. &quot;Or the chance 
EVERY damper in this place would fail!&quot;

        Explosions echoed in the lower levels seconds after Roulette 
acted, and Enchantress smiled coldly. She gestured, &quot;Sllaw emoc gnillaf 
nwod!

        BOOM!

        In moments where a mighty Fortress once stood.. rubble and ash 
remained. They exploded from the ruins, scattering to the four winds 
before anyone could possibly stop them. Villains, killers, thieves, they 
were all free, all ready to bring forth their own special brand of evil.

        On a rise not far from the Fortress they stood, hidden from 
prying eyes. &quot;You delivered as promised,&quot; the Scarecrow murmured, &quot;I&#39;m 
impressed.&quot;

        &quot;Not bad at all,&quot; Metallix extended finger blades, morphing her 
form happily.

        &quot;So, you have a plan?&quot; Vox asked.

        The Enchantress nodded, &quot;I&#39;m curious myself.&quot;

        &quot;I have a certain Patron who arranged my arrival in the 
Fortress,&quot; Roulette said calmly, &quot;and she&#39;s got plans for us. Like the 
destruction of the Justice League, to start with. Once we gather a few 
more recruits, of course.&quot;</pre>
