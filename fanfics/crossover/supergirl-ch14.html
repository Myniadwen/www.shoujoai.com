<a href="../crossover/supergirl-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>        A soft hum and a burst of light and sound, then there was a 
displacement of air as three figures appeared in the teleport tubes. The 
Martian Manhunter steped out first, then Green Lantern, while the Flash 
zipped around the room at high speed.

&quot;Wowthisissoneat!CouldIgoonaheadpleaseandtakealookaround,please,please?Iwont 
touchanythingIswear..&quot; Flash turned to ask J&#39;onn excitedly.

        &quot;Slow down,&quot; Green Lantern grinned at her friend. The green 
haired woman turned to the Manhunter, &quot;Sorry, she sometimes forgets she 
operates a few speeds faster than everybody else.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Flash&#39;s blush was visible even underneath her cowl.

        &#39;She reminds me of Wally West, back when I first met him,&#39; J&#39;onn 
thought. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; he smiled, &quot;and I caught the majority of what 
you said. Go on ahead to the meeting room, but be careful.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Flash waved and was gone, leaving traces of lightning 
hanging in the air.

        &quot;It&#39;s been a long time sir,&quot; Green Lantern said as the walked 
down the corridor together. &quot;I&#39;m not sure if you remember me,&quot; she used 
her ring to remove her mask, &quot;but I&#39;m Kyla Scott.&quot;

        &quot;Of course I remember,&quot; J&#39;onn smiled, &quot;you, A-ko and the others 
back when we in the JLA would take you all for summer camp.&quot;

        &quot;That, and to train us in our powers,&quot; Kyla agreed.

        Cleaning up the monitor room, D-ko paused as an odd rumble could 
be heard. &quot;EEP!&quot; the blonde squeaked as a object whizzed on by her.

        &quot;Excuse me.&quot; the red blur shouted back before disapearing.

        &quot;Oracle!&quot; D-ko cried, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

        In another part of the Watchtower there was a flicker in the 
hallway and the Oracle hologram appeared in front of them. &quot;I&#39;ve just 
been told there&#39;s a super speed object moving around the Watchtower,&quot; 
she smiled, &quot;I take it that&#39;s Flash?&quot;

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; J&#39;onn nodded to her, &quot;and I&#39;d like to introduce you to 
Ms. Kyla Scott, Earth&#39;s latest Green Lantern.&quot;

        &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Kyla squeeked nervously. &#39;She&#39;s gorgeous,&#39; 
the woman thought as she looked the redhead over, &#39;too bad she&#39;s a 
hologram.&#39;

        &quot;Nice to meet you too,&quot; Oracle smiled. She turned to J&#39;onn, 
&quot;I&#39;ve heard back from Kestrel, Supergirl and Steel, they should be here 
momentarily.&quot;

        Not long before in the city of Metropolis the three of them 
exited the elevator into the Lexcorp tower&#39;s lobby as Lena Luthor waved 
both A-ko and B-ko on ahead of her. The tall redhead in the business 
suit said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m glad you came by to visit.&quot;

        &quot;So am I,&quot; B-ko admitted. A bit more quietly, &quot;Maybe we could do 
it again sometime.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d be glad to,&quot; Lena smiled. She smiled slightly as she looked 
over at A-ko, &quot;We&#39;ll try not to lapse so much into techno-babble next 
time.&quot;

        A blushing A-ko chuckled softly, &quot;Heh, I got some good food and 
a nap.&quot; She shrugged, &quot;The trip was a success to me.&quot;

        &quot;So speaks the walking appetite,&quot; B-ko chuckled. She hesitated, 
then stepped forward to give her mother a hug, &quot;See you later.&quot;

        &quot;Soon,&quot; Lena hugged her back a bit akwardly.

        Both young women walked out the front doors and onto the street 
before they disappeared from Lena&#39;s line of sight. She stood there a 
moment, lost in her thoughts until her assistant literally popped up 
from nowhere.

        &quot;How did it go?&quot; Jessica Olsen asked cheerfully.

        &quot;Pretty good,&quot; Lena admitted as Jessica passed over a personal 
organizer. &quot;She&#39;s going to come over and see me again, at least.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s not bad at all,&quot; Jessica and Lena walked over to the 
elevator together, &quot;have you come out to her yet?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not quite ready to admit to my daughter that her Dad used 
my sexuality to blackmail me to stay away from her,&quot; Lena explained 
dryly.

        &quot;Well, considering how close she and A-ko seem to be, she&#39;d 
probably understand,&quot; Jessica offered cheerfully.

        &quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; Lena murmured softly.

        Back up on the Watchtower A-ko and B-ko stepped out of the 
teleporter together. They stopped when they heard it start up again, and 
Kestrel stepped off the platform beside them.

        &quot;How did seeing your mother go?&quot; Kestrel asked, pausing while 
both A- ko and B-ko changed into their costumes.

        &quot;Pretty well,&quot; B-ko admitted as she locked own the final semets 
of her Steel armor.

        Kestrel gave her a gentle smile, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

        &quot;And they&#39;re so alike it&#39;s almost scary,&quot; A-ko added as she 
pulled her &#39;S&#39; logo T-shirt on, &quot;the tech-talk was so thick you could 
have cut it with a knife.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m planning on going down to see her again,&quot; B-ko said as she 
and the others set off down the hallway. Looking over at Kestrel, &quot;Would 
you like to come along next time?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d be honored,&quot; Kestrel pushed back her cowl with a smile. 
&quot;Are you doing anything after we get the meeting finished?&quot; Helena Wayne 
asked.

        &quot;Some lab work is all,&quot; B-ko looked over at the dark haired 
young woman curiously.

        &quot;Once your done would you like to go out?&quot; Helena offered. She 
smiled slightly, &quot;I still haven&#39;t had a chance to show you arround 
Gotham yet.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; B-ko smiled back.

        As they neared the meeting room A-ko&#39;s enhanced hearing picked 
up the two new voices. &quot;Sounds like GL and Flash are already here,&quot; she 
warned them.

        Helena pulled her cowl back up smoothly, as B-ko activated her 
visor, darkening it slightly to obscure her face. &quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; B-ko 
nodded.

        A-ko lead the way inside the room, smiling happily as she 
recognized the Green Lantern immediately, &quot;Hi, Kyla!&quot;

        &quot;A-ko,&quot; the Flash hit her with a flying hug, &quot;it&#39;s good to see 
you again!&quot; She pulled back her hood, &quot;It&#39;s me, Iris!&quot;

        Kyla, Iris and A-ko were exchganging happy greetings as B-ko 
looked at the three of them oddly, &quot;You all know each other?&quot;

        &quot;We all used to meet over the summer holidays,&quot; A-ko grinned at 
her, &quot;the kids of the JLA. Our parents helped train us while we played 
together.&quot;

        &quot;Did you meet Kestrel back then too?&quot; B-ko asked softly.

        Kestrel shook her head, &quot;Grandpa never got involved in that 
stuff much, other than his duties as A-ko&#39;s godfather.&quot;

        Strangely, B-ko felt relieved at hearing that.

        &quot;If you&#39;re done with the hellos,&quot; J&#39;onn smiled, &quot;I&#39;d like to get 
back to the reason we invited the two of you up here: to invite you into 
joining the Justice League.&quot;

        &quot;Iris would be a good member,&quot; Kyla smiled, &quot;but I think I&#39;m a 
little too green at this, if you&#39;ll pardon the bad pun.&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t put yourself down,&quot; Iris spoke up firmly, &quot;they wouldn&#39;t 
have chosen you if you couldn&#39;t handle the job.&quot;

        &quot;Even when I knew you before you became a Green Lantern,&quot; A-ko 
said, &quot;you used Alan Scott&#39;s ring expertly. Trust me, you can do the 
job.&quot;

        Kestrel held up her hand, &quot;I&#39;m not going to push you into 
joining us. I didn&#39;t choose to put this costume on until I was sure I 
was ready.&quot; Her voice acquired a certain intensity, &quot;But once we put 
these costumes on, they carry a responsibility to help the greatest 
number of people as possible.&quot;

        Kyla was nodding thoughtfully, &quot;I guess once I put this suit on 
I accepted the responsibility.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;All right, I&#39;m 
in.&quot;

        &quot;Then so am I,&quot; Iris beamed,</pre>
