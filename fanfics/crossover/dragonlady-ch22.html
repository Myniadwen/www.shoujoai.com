&quot;Rick?&quot; Ranma said as she entered his room.

The dark-haired young man was in his bed playing with a model biplane 
that Roy had brought him to occupy his time.

&quot;Hi DL,&quot; Rick said cheerfully. &quot;Minmei came by to visit...&quot; Rick trailed 
off when he noticed the grim expression on Ranma&#39;s face.

&quot;Rick...&quot; Ranma said, coming over to the bed.

&quot;W...what&#39;s wrong, DL?&quot; Rick asked.

&quot;It&#39;s Roy,&quot; Ranma said sadly. &quot;He got shot up pretty badly. He&#39;s in ICU. 
They had to remove his spleen, a kidney, and three ribs. There was a lot 
of internal bleeding and most of his other internal organs were bruised. 
He won&#39;t be able to fly combat anymore.&quot;

&quot;Big Brother?&quot; Rick said in shock. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Rick,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I couldn&#39;t get to him in time. All I 
could to was kill the one that got him and make sure the medical team 
was waiting when he got on the ground. He kept saying he was fine, the 
macho jerk. If we had believed him he&#39;d be dead. As it was it was a 
close thing. They say he&#39;ll be okay though.&quot;

&quot;Big Brother can&#39;t fly anymore?&quot; Rick asked, still clearly in shock.

The model slipped from his hand and crashed to the floor. The little 
biplane was painted in Skull livery, making for a poignant symbolism as 
it nosed into the floor and broke into pieces. Ranma took Rick&#39;s hand 
supportively.

&quot;Not combat, or aerobatically,&quot; Ranma said sadly. &quot;Without the ribs, his 
body won&#39;t have the support necessary to endure the g-forces involved. 
I&#39;m sorry, Rick. I know how close you two are. He&#39;ll need you now, to 
help him get through this. He&#39;s a good friend to me too.&quot;

&quot;Can I see him?&quot; Rick asked.

&quot;Not until he&#39;s out of ICU,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;They said it will be a few 
days. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Rick said somberly. &quot;At least he&#39;s alive.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma said. &#39;At least,&#39; she thought, trying to imagine how she&#39;d 
feel if she wasn&#39;t able to practice her art anymore.

(oO\O/Oo)

A week later, they took Roy out of ICU and Ranma came to visit him.

&quot;Hey Roy,&quot; Ranma said cheerfully coming into the room.

&quot;Are you happy now?&quot; Roy asked weakly as Ranma stepped up to the bed. 
&quot;You should have let me die.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, where did that come from?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;They told me I couldn&#39;t fly combat anymore,&quot; Roy said, depressed. &quot;I&#39;m 
washed up, useless. I always thought I would die in combat. I&#39;d go out 
in a blaze of glory. Now, I&#39;m gonna die as some useless has-been.&quot;

&quot;Well, with that attitude you just might,&quot; Ranma said sourly. &quot;You&#39;re 
far from useless, Roy. So what if you can&#39;t fly combat anymore. There&#39;re 
other things in life besides that. There&#39;s other ways you can help fight 
the war besides in the cockpit of a Veritech.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot; Roy asked bitterly. &quot;You&#39;re a fighter pilot and a damn good 
one. Are you telling me that you would find anything else as 
fulfilling?&quot;

&quot;How about fatherhood?&quot; Ranma asked. &quot;How about being a husband? Are you 
that big of an adrenaline junky that you don&#39;t care about the woman that 
loves you? I&#39;m not saying that you don&#39;t have a right to be depressed 
over losing something as important to you as my art is to me, but there 
are other things that you can be just as dedicated to.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, like Claudia would want some washed up has-been like me,&quot; Roy 
argued.

&quot;Roy,&quot; Ranma said, &quot;don&#39;t be a jackass. You&#39;re more than just a fighter 
pilot, you know? You&#39;re a great CO, a fantastic mentor, a really great 
friend, and I&#39;m sure if you weren&#39;t a better than average lover, then 
Claudia wouldn&#39;t give you the time of day.

&quot;You once told me that you respected my courage and inner strength for 
choosing to go on with my life in spite of the major change that was 
thrust upon me. Well, guess what my friend? It&#39;s time for you to step up 
to the plate. You&#39;ve just had a major change thrust on you. You can 
either choose to make the best of it, or you can be a fucking wuss and 
let it kick your ass.&quot;

&quot;Flying is all I know,&quot; Roy said. &quot;What else am I good for? Flying 
transports? No thanks.&quot;

&quot;Bullshit Roy,&quot; Ranma denied. &quot;You know a lot of things. How about 
command of your own ship? With your career it&#39;d be yours if you wanted 
it. How about being an instructor? You&#39;d be a good one. Remember I know. 
You taught me a lot about being a fighter pilot. That&#39;s just what I can 
think of off the top of my head. I bet Claudia would have some ideas for 
you.&quot;

Roy said nothing. He just stared at the ceiling. Ranma couldn&#39;t tell if 
he was thinking over what she had said or if he was just refusing to 
argue anymore.

&quot;She loves you, Roy,&quot; Ranma said softly. &quot;We all do. Me, Lisa, Rick, but 
most of all, Claudia. Seeing you give up on yourself is tearing her 
apart.&quot; Ranma took Roy&#39;s hand and gave it a squeeze. &quot;I&#39;ve gotta go. I 
have a real hot brunette to take on a dinner date. Think about what I 
said, Roy.&quot; Ranma tried to release his hand but Roy held on to hers.

&quot;Ranma,&quot; Roy said, his voice carrying more life in it than any other 
time since she&#39;d come in. &quot;I want Rick to take over Skull. I want you 
acting CAG.&quot; Ranma nodded.

&quot;Done,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;ll inform the Captain. This means Rick and I are 
going to need you around to make sure we don&#39;t screw everything up.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess I&#39;ll have to stick around to bust your chops when either 
of you get too cocky then, won&#39;t I?&quot; Roy asked. &quot;Now there&#39;s something 
to live for.&quot;

&quot;Roy, believe me when I say that getting &#39;cocky&#39; is not one of my 
problems,&quot; Ranma joked. Roy was still grinning when she left the room.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;RANMA SAOTOME-HAYES!&quot; someone shrieked behind Ranma and Lisa as they 
strolled through the park holding hands.

Ranma whirled about just in time to get swept up into a crushing hug and 
spun around before being placed back on the ground and kissed 
thoroughly. Her eyes widened into saucers and her braid stuck straight 
out as she flapped her arms. Her amorous assailant disengaged and let 
her go. Ranma looked up to see the broadly smiling visage of one Claudia 
Grant.

&quot;I...uh...Claudia...w...what was that about?&quot; Ranma stammered.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you said to Roy to break him out of that funk he was 
in, but I owe you big time, girlfriend,&quot; Claudia practically glowed with 
joy. &quot;Not only is he acting almost not depressed anymore, but he asked 
me to marry him!&quot; Claudia swept Lisa up in a hug next and twirled her 
around.

&quot;Hey, easy on the mother to be,&quot; Ranma giggled.

&quot;Oh, yeah, sorry,&quot; Claudia set Lisa down with a sheepish grin. &quot;I&#39;m just 
so happy.&quot;

&quot;He really asked you to marry him?&quot; Lisa asked enthusiastically. &quot;And 
you said yes, of course.&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Claudia smiled brightly. &quot;And I owe it all to Ranma. Roy said he 
had a nice talk with our little redhead here and she put some things in 
perspective for him.&quot;

&quot;Well, I just pointed out some things to him and told him to quit being 
a jackass,&quot; Ranma blushed.

&quot;You didn&#39;t?&quot; Lisa asked, giggling.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I told him that he could either choose to make the 
most of this change in his life or he could be a big wuss and choose to 
let it destroy him.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you said, it was what he needed to hear,&quot; Claudia said 
gratefully. &quot;I don&#39;t know what I would have done if he had just given 
up.&quot;

&quot;Just remember, Claudia,&quot; Ranma said, &quot;he&#39;s going to have a hard time 
for a while. He has to find a new place in life and there&#39;s gonna be 
some growing pains. You need to be patient with him and support him as 
much as possible.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;I&#39;ll do whatever I need to. I love him.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;He&#39;s a great guy and I&#39;d hate to lose him.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to be a great CAG, Ranma,&quot; Claudia said.

&quot;What?&quot; Lisa asked, surprised.

&quot;Ranma didn&#39;t tell you?&quot; Claudia grinned. &quot;Roy wants her to take over 
his position as CAG and he wants Rick to lead the Skull.&quot;

&quot;No, Ranma failed to mention that,&quot; Lisa said, looking at Ranma with 
half lidded eyes. &quot;Why did you not mention that, Honey?&quot;

&quot;Um...it never came up?&quot; Ranma said nervously. &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not 
something I think of as good news. It&#39;s not as if I wanted it. I can 
never replace Roy.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;ll be just as good a CAG as Roy,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;You are 
both a lot alike as far as your leadership style.&quot;

&quot;Gee, I wonder why?&quot; Ranma grinned.

&quot;You&#39;ll do fine, Sweetie,&quot; Lisa assured her.

&quot;And it&#39;s not like Roy won&#39;t be around to mentor you,&quot; Claudia pointed 
out.

&quot;Yeah, well, I just don&#39;t know if I want all the responsibility,&quot; Ranma 
said. &quot;I only agreed to it because Roy wanted it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, and you&#39;re just a simple fighter pilot...&quot; Lisa rolled her 
eyes. &quot;Besides, would you rather have some pompous ass like Maistroff be 
the CAG?&quot; Ranma shuddered.

&quot;Well, not that we&#39;ve settled that,&quot; Claudia said. &quot;I certainly have 
started moving in some high circles. Imagine me being best friends with 
the two most powerful women on the ship. Who&#39;d have thought?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Ranma snorted.

&quot;Honey, you just don&#39;t realize it, but you and your spouse have run this 
ship for a long time now,&quot; Claudia smirked. &quot;The captain is only in 
charge because you allow it. Lisa runs the crew and Roy has made it no 
secret that you are his prot&eacute;g&eacute;. You have a lot of loyalty from the 
pilots and even the Marines. Whoever isn&#39;t loyal to one or the other is 
terrified to cross you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s us,&quot; Ranma quipped. &quot;DL2, ruling the ship with an iron fist.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;Well if it isn&#39;t the little redhead bitch,&quot; Ranma heard a voice say as 
she was walking along on her way to see her mother. She turned and saw 
who had verbally assaulted her...Lynn Kyle. Great.

&quot;What do you want, Pervert?&quot; Ranma sneered.

&quot;You ruined everything,&quot; Kyle snarled at her. He was obviously drunk. 
&quot;Minmei hates me now and my parents kicked me out of my own home. And 
now I&#39;m stuck on this goddam ship. All because of you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the one that hit Minmei, asshole,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;It seems to me 
that you need to take responsibility for your own actions.&quot;

&quot;It seems to me that I&#39;m about to kick your ass, little girl,&quot; Kyle 
smirked. &quot;You caught me by surprise before. That won&#39;t happen again.&quot;

&quot;Oh? That&#39;s interesting,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;How&#39;s the nose, by the way? Still 
sore, I bet. As much as I could use the stress relief beating the shit 
out of you would bring, I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll have to decline you offer. 
There&#39;s no honor in beating on a pathetic juicer like you. How much 
liquid backbone did it take you to challenge me anyway? You&#39;re so drunk 
you couldn&#39;t whip your way out of a wet paper bag.&quot;

Kyle took a jab at her. Ranma leaned slightly to the side and Kyle 
struck nothing but air. She leaned back to avoid a thrust kick then 
leaped over a foot sweep. Stepping out of the way of another jab, she 
then flipped backward away from the follow up high kick. By now a crowd 
was gathering to watch Kyle being humiliated.

&quot;Hi Mom,&quot; Bertha said.

Ranma looked over and gave Bertha, Natalia, Marissa, Erin, and Midori a 
smile.

&quot;Hey, Bertha, girls,&quot; Ranma said conversationally, clearly ignoring 
Kyle&#39;s attempts to hit her even while ducking and dodging them. &quot;Fancy 
meeting you here.&quot;

&quot;Ah, well, we were going out to the club,&quot; Bertha chuckled. &quot;I have to 
ask, what&#39;s with him and why don&#39;t you just put him down and be done 
with it?&quot;

&quot;Oh, this is Lynn Kyle,&quot; Ranma said casually. &quot;He&#39;s a pervert and an 
idiot. He likes to beat on girls, usually defenseless ones, but right 
now he&#39;s so drunk he managed to confuse me with the latter category. As 
to why I just don&#39;t take him out, well, there&#39;s no honor in beating up 
those so much weaker than one&#39;s self. He&#39;s just a pathetic juicer, no 
threat to me.&quot;

The truth of her words was clear as she chatted with the girls, ignoring 
Kyle while nonchalantly avoiding his continued attempts to strike her.

&quot;Likes to beat on girls, huh?&quot; Bertha said with a wicked grin.

Ranma shrugged and gestured with her head in Kyle&#39;s direction as if the 
truth was self-evident. Indeed, it was.

&quot;Would you mind if I take him off your hands?&quot; Bertha grinned evilly.

&quot;Not sure why you&#39;d want him,&quot; Ranma said, &quot;but be my guest.&quot;

Bertha grinned and nodded. She stepped in and caught Kyle&#39;s fist in her 
hand. Kyle looked perplexed and looked to see who had caught his hand. 
He looked up...and up...and up a little more until he met the eyes of 
the statuesque beauty before him.

&quot;Hey cutie,&quot; Bertha said. Kyle blinked and lowered his gaze to her 
generous cleavage.

&quot;Hey, Babe,&quot; Kyle flashed her a smile.

&quot;What do you say you forget about Little Red here and we go off and have 
some fun?&quot; Bertha suggested.

&quot;Um...sure,&quot; Kyle said glancing at Ranma. &quot;I can kick her ass anytime. 
Let&#39;s go. Your place or mine, Sweetness?&quot;

&quot;Oh mine, definitely,&quot; Bertha grinned evilly as she led him off amidst 
the giggles of the other Roses.

&quot;You know, I almost feel sorry for him,&quot; Ranma giggled. &quot;Almost.&quot;

&quot;Heh, he has it coming,&quot; Erin said. &quot;You want to join us, Mom?&quot;

&quot;Thanks, but no,&quot; Ranma declined. &quot;I&#39;m taking my mother to dinner.&quot;

&quot;Aw, that&#39;s sweet of you,&quot; Marissa said with a smile.

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen her since I was 6 years old. We have a lot of catching 
up to do and she wants to get to know her daughter,&quot; Ranma grinned.

&quot;Well, you two have fun then,&quot; Marissa said. The others waved and they 
headed off toward the club.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma knocked on the door of her mother&#39;s apartment and waited. After a 
minute, the door was opened to reveal the person in question dressed in 
an elegant traditional kimono printed with images of cherry blossom 
trees in full bloom. Her deep red hair was pinned up and her makeup was 
flawless.

&quot;Wow, Momma, you look great,&quot; Ranma said, impressed. She felt 
underdressed in her uniform.

&quot;Why thank you, Daughter,&quot; Nodoka smiled warmly. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;

&quot;If you are, Momma,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;We&#39;re going to a great place called 
the White Dragon. They have the best food in Macross.&quot;

&quot;Very good,&quot; Nodoka said and turned to lock her door.

The pair linked arms and strolled toward the restaurant.

&quot;So how are you?&quot; Nodoka asked casually. Ranma sighed.

&quot;I&#39;ve been better, Momma,&quot; Ranma admitted.

&quot;Oh? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; the older woman asked.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s just that my life has just gotten a lot more complicated,&quot; 
Ranma said. &quot;The man you and Kasumi saved the other day, Roy Fokker?&quot; 
Nodoka nodded. &quot;He is one of my best friends and my mentor. It&#39;s very 
hard on him that he can&#39;t fly anymore. I can only imagine how difficult 
it would be for me if I found out I couldn&#39;t practice the art anymore. 
He&#39;s taking it pretty hard.&quot;

&quot;I spoke with him earlier and he mentioned that you told him a few 
truths that improved his outlook,&quot; Nodoka said.

&quot;For now,&quot; Ranma said cryptically. &quot;It&#39;s not going to be easy for him to 
adjust. Especially when the rest of us are out there slugging it out 
with the Zentradi.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Nodoka said firmly. &quot;He has friends like you and Lisa 
and a fianc&eacute;e like that nice Miss Grant to help him get through it. I&#39;m 
very proud of how you handled it, Daughter. Before you spoke with him, 
it was like he was dead, but his body just didn&#39;t know it yet.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, he&#39;s been there for me enough,&quot; Ranma replied. &quot;But that&#39;s 
not the real problem.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Nodoka prompted.

&quot;The real problem is he wants me to take over as CAG,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know if I&#39;m ready for that sort of responsibility. I have a hard 
enough time dealing with losing people in my squadron without feeling 
responsible for the entire air group.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Nodoka said as they walked down the sidewalk. &quot;So do you doubt 
Commander Fokker&#39;s judgment?&quot;

&quot;No, never, why?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Well, he obviously seems to think you are the best one for the job,&quot; 
Nodoka explained. &quot;I&#39;ve spoken with him about you at some length during 
the course of my duties. He holds you in quite high regard, both 
professionally and personally.&quot; Ranma blushed slightly at the indirect 
praise.

&quot;I try my best, Momma,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;He&#39;s been a good teacher. I learned 
a lot from him and I wouldn&#39;t be where I am if it wasn&#39;t for him. 
There&#39;s still a lot of chauvinism out there in the fighter community. He 
ignored that and saw me for my abilities to the point of going out on a 
limb to get me my own command.&quot;

&quot;And it paid off for him, didn&#39;t it?&quot; Nodoka asked. &quot;I&#39;ve heard all 
about your Wild Rose squadron. You girls are very highly regarded by the 
military personnel that I&#39;ve treated. Quite a few of them say they 
wouldn&#146;t be here today if not for you and your girls.&quot;

&quot;Well, we do have one guy in the unit now,&quot; Ranma grinned. &quot;I guess he 
does tend to get overlooked in spite of the fact that he&#39;s one of our 
top pilots.&quot;

&quot;Indeed?&quot; Nodoka smiled. &quot;Life must be interesting for him, being in a 
unit full of lovely and highly skilled young women.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea,&quot; Ranma giggled. &quot;I don&#39;t know how he stands it. If 
the girls aren&#146;t teasing him, then it&#39;s the male pilots from other 
units. He just blows it off like it&#39;s no big deal. He&#39;s actually proud 
to be one of us.&quot;

&quot;Well, you are an elite unit if what I&#39;ve heard is correct,&quot; Nodoka 
said. &quot;Which brings us back to Commander Fokker&#39;s recommendation; he was 
right to give you your own command, so could it be that he&#39;s right to 
recommend you for Commander of the Air Group?&quot;

&quot;I know, Momma, but it&#39;s just that I&#39;m not very diplomatic at times,&quot; 
Ranma sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not into the whole political butt-sucking thing and 
that might hurt my ability to get things done. You should hear what I 
told the UNEDC brass. It&#39;s a wonder I wasn&#39;t thrown in the brig.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re at war, Dear,&quot; Nodoka said simply. &quot;We need men and women of 
action in command. We need people that aren&#39;t afraid to step on a few 
toes to get the job done. Sounds to me like you&#39;re exactly the person 
needed to fill Commander Fokker&#39;s shoes.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ll do the best I can,&quot; Ranma agreed. &quot;I just hope it&#39;s good 
enough.&quot;

&quot;I have faith in you, My Daughter,&quot; Nodoka smiled. &quot;I&#39;m certain you will 
be more than good enough.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Momma,&quot; Ranma gave her a warm smile. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad also,&quot; Nodoka said, hugging her daughter.

&quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Ranma said, opening the door for her mother.

&quot;Oh, hello, Ranma,&quot; Lina greeted.

&quot;Hi Lina,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet my mother, Saotome Nodoka. 
Momma this is Lynn Lina. She and her husband Max are the owners.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Saotome-san,&quot; Lina said with a deep bow of 
respect. &quot;You&#39;re daughter is not only one of our best customers, but a 
personal friend to our family. It is a great honor to meet her mother.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Lynn-san, though I can&#39;t claim any responsibility for the 
fine respected person my daughter seems to be,&quot; Nodoka said sadly. &quot;I 
have only just been reunited with her after nearly 20 years.&quot;

&quot;Oh, how sad,&quot; Lina said sympathetically. &quot;Well, let me assure you, 
Saotome-san, your daughter is a fine young woman and is highly respected 
in the community.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Lynn-san,&quot; Nodoka said sincerely. &quot;I grow more proud of her 
every day. But, please, call me Nodoka.&quot;

&quot;Certainly, Nodoka, if you call me Lina,&quot; the other woman smiled warmly.

&quot;So how&#39;s Minmei doing?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;She&#39;s currently working on a movie,&quot; Lina replied. &quot;They are 
having...problems though.&quot;

&quot;Oh? How so?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Well, it seems they cast my honorless son as the leading man and Minmei 
has refused to work with him. She told them that they could either fire 
him, or she was quitting. I say good for her.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I had another altercation with him while on the way to Momma&#39;s 
apartment,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;He was drunk and challenged me. I refused 
because it wouldn&#39;t be honorable to beat up on someone that wasn&#39;t a 
threat to you, but he attacked anyway. I just avoided him until 
someone...um...distracted him.&quot; Ranma said the last part with a smirk.

&quot;Oh, I hope you weren&#39;t hurt,&quot; Lina said, bowing her head in shame.

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;He couldn&#39;t even touch me. I get the feeling 
he&#39;ll be getting an attitude adjustment very soon though.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Lina asked curiously.

&quot;Don&#39;t ask,&quot; Ranma grinned enigmatically. &quot;Suffice it to say, he left in 
the company of a certain dominant woman I know. If anyone can, she can 
set him...er...straight.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Lina said, obviously not seeing, but willing to let it go. 
&quot;Come then, let&#39;s get you a table.&quot;

(oO\O/Oo)

May 2010...

&quot;Hey Big Brother,&quot; Rick said cheerfully as he walked into the room.

&quot;Hey Kid,&quot; Roy said. &quot;So did Ranma tell you?&quot;

&quot;About what happened to you?&quot; Rick asked. &quot;Yeah, she told me. Tough 
break. How are you holding up?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; Roy said. &quot;Did she tell you I wanted you to take over Skull 
Squadron?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I heard that,&quot; Rick said. &quot;I guess I have some pretty big shoes 
to fill.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t sweat it, you&#39;ll do fine,&quot; Roy assured him. &quot;Just listen to your 
CAG and follow her lead.&quot;

&quot;Her lead?&quot; Rick asked.

&quot;Yeah, she didn&#39;t tell you that part?&quot; Roy asked. &quot;I guess she wouldn&#39;t, 
would she? I recommended Ranma as the new CAG and Captain Gloval 
approved it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Better her than me. That&#39;s a lot of 
responsibility.&quot;

&quot;She can handle it,&quot; Roy said. &quot;I always intended to pass the reigns to 
her, but I never thought it would be this soon.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll miss you out there,&quot; Rick said. &quot;Have you thought about what you 
will do now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got some ideas,&quot; Roy said. &quot;When I get out of here, I&#39;ll probably 
do some instructing. I&#39;ve also agreed to work with Dr. Lang on some 
Veritech improvement projects.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Rick smiled. &quot;I also hear that there are some congratulations 
in order. You finally decided to quit living in sin with Lt. Commander 
Grant, I heard.&quot;

&quot;Heh, yeah, I asked and she said yes,&quot; Roy smirked. &quot;Don&#39;t know why she 
would want a washed up old has-been like me though.&quot;

&quot;Oh stop it, Big Brother...or I&#39;ll send DL in here after you,&quot; Rick said 
with a wicked grin.

&quot;No, please, anything but that,&quot; Roy said with an obviously contrived 
look of horror and waving his hands mock surrender. Rick laughed.

&quot;You know, I never thought in a million years that I&#39;d be more scared of 
facing one little redheaded girl than a squad of forty foot giants,&quot; 
Rick said, &quot;but I have to admit, that&#39;s one scary woman.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Roy agreed. &quot;But she&#39;s got a heart of gold.&quot;

&quot;And a fist of depleted Uranium,&quot; Rick snorted.

&quot;On no,&quot; Roy disagreed. &quot;It&#39;s much harder than that.&quot;

Both of them laughed merrily, though Roy did have to grimace at the pain 
the laughter caused.

Ranma, Lisa, Akane, Max, and Kasumi stood on the deck as the sun broke 
the horizon.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;What a lovely sunrise.&quot;

&quot;Enjoy it now, Sis,&quot; Akane said. &quot;Eventually the repairs with be 
complete and we&#39;ll be done taking on supplies. Then those bastards in 
charge will be running us off the planet on a rail.&quot;

&quot;Akane!&quot; Kasumi protested.

&quot;She&#39;s right, Dr. Tendo,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;We spent over a year without the 
simple pleasure of seeing a sunrise or sunset or even smelling the crisp 
morning air. And soon, we&#39;ll be ordered back in to space for who knows 
how long, if we even survive.&quot;

&quot;Still, space can be beautiful too,&quot; Max pointed out. &quot;I&#39;ll miss being 
able to walk around out here unprotected and smelling the salt air, but 
there&#39;s nothing quite like the view of the stars from space.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma agreed. &quot;There&#39;s more of them than you can ever imagine. 
Like grains of white sand scattered on a black cloth, and the planets 
were an incredible sight. Saturn had to be the most awesome sight. I 
remember flying above the rings. I didn&#39;t have much time to appreciate 
it, but I did get a few moments to enjoy the view before we engaged the 
Zentradi forces.&quot;

&quot;It would have been a much more pleasant tour of our solar system if we 
weren&#39;t fighting for our lives,&quot; Akane said. &quot;It was hard to really take 
the time to enjoy it with the threat hanging over our heads.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I can see where that might make things less pleasant,&quot; Kasumi 
admitted. &quot;But still you managed.&quot;

&quot;We got lucky,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;These Zentradi don&#39;t seem to know quite how 
to deal with us. Eventually they&#39;ll figure it out and we&#39;ll be 
finished.&quot;

&quot;Ranma, that&#39;s not a very inspiring thing to say,&quot; Lisa admonished.

&quot;It&#39;s true though,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;Those fools in command are making a 
huge mistake that&#39;s likely to cost a lot of lives, both on Earth and on 
the SDF-1. And the way they refuse to let the civilians off the ship 
pisses me off to no end.&quot;

&quot;We all feel that way,&quot; Lisa agreed. &quot;It&#39;s shameful what they have 
done.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be careful of saying such things?&quot; Kasumi asked. &quot;Isn&#39;t 
that sedition?&quot;

&quot;What are they gonna do? Kick us off the planet?&quot; Max asked wryly, which 
caused the other officers to chuckle ruefully.

&quot;Anyway, Ranma here, with her astounding skills in diplomacy, told them 
that to their faces,&quot; Lisa giggled. &quot;She told them point blank that they 
had no honor and that they made her ashamed to be a UNEDF officer.&quot;

&quot;Oh my,&quot; Kasumi said.

&quot;That&#39;s our Mom,&quot; Akane chuckled. &quot;Never afraid to call it like she sees 
it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been through too much crap to engage in platitudes with 
self-important fools,&quot; Ranma said flatly.

&quot;And that&#39;s why we love you, Mom,&quot; Akane grinned.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Max agreed.

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Ranma smiled. &quot;You guys really do care.&quot; Her tone shifted 
into her &#39;Sensei&#39; voice. &quot;Okay, you guys ready to do some Tai Chi?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sensei,&quot; was said in chorus.

&quot;Very well, take your places and let&#39;s do it,&quot; Ranma grinned.
