<a href="../crossover/deepdown-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>&quot;Just another night in Juuban&quot;

 
 
          &quot;What are the chances of this occurring?  We&#39;re probably the 
only two to survive and out of all the people and places in Japan, we 
manage to find each other.&quot;  The purple eyed girl mused mostly to 
herself as she stirred what was left of her tea.  Hotaru stared out the 
window of the caf&#130;, leaning her head against her hand and began to lose 
herself in thought.
 
          She and Makoto discussed their linkage for only short periods 
of time.  Neither was apt to give too much information and neither was 
willing to relive the worst of what happened.  At least, that was how 
the dark haired girl was thinking.  The rogue seemed stiff and short 
when she answered.  Her explanations had too many holes in them; but 
Hotaru felt too uncomfortable to pry into her behavior and simply let 
her be.
 
          &quot;Do you think they&#39;ll come after us?  It seems they&#39;ve left us 
alone till now... still...&quot; There was doubt evident in the Goth&#39;s voice 
and she silently berated herself, remembering if they hadn&#39;t come by 
now, there was definitely a reason and they were simply biding their 
time.  Her father had warned her that the &#39;Abyss&#39; (not the true name of 
the organization, just a code name they&#39;d given themselves) worked by 
their own set of rules and were very efficient about achieving their 
goals.
 
          The Abyss always saw their plans through to the end.
 
          Hotaru knew she was left alive for a reason; it was now a 
matter of waiting to find out that reason.  As for Makoto, the dark 
haired girl knew she saw the tall teen&#39;s name on that hit list and 
therefore should be dead, like the rest.
 
          &quot;Do you seek revenge?&quot;
 
          The rogue&#39;s rough voice broke Hotaru out of her thoughts.  She 
hadn&#39;t told Makoto the details of her family&#39;s murder, but she sensed 
the girl could understand, even without her having to say anything.  
What they had done to her parents was an act of mercy compared to her 
own tortures.  She often wished they would have finished the job, one 
simple shot to the temple exactly like what happened to her mother; 
instead she was forced to live on, live on with the nightmarish memories 
of those weeks.
 
          The Goth pushed away the half empty cup of tea and breathed in 
deeply, &quot;Even if I could, I wouldn&#39;t know where to begin.&quot;
 
          &quot;That&#39;s not what I asked!&quot;  Purple eyes widened in shock as 
she saw the rogue slam her fist into the table, half-shouting at her.  
Several people in the restaurant looked towards the chestnut haired girl 
with disgust for interrupting the quiet atmosphere of the late Sunday 
morning.  The air suddenly became a thickened silence so dense and 
adamantine that no one dared move for fear they&#39;d break under the weight 
of it.
 
          &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;  Makoto whispered this time, the ire still evident 
in her voice.  She threw a wad of cash on the table, Hotaru figuring the 
excess was the rogue trying to make up for the scene she&#39;d made.  
Quietly and quickly, the pale teen stood up and followed her 
upperclassman out of the caf&#130; and back onto the sidewalk.
 
          They fell into step again, the Goth noting the lengthened 
strides of her tall friend and quickening her own pace to keep up.  It 
was clear Makoto was agitated, but exactly what had set her off, the 
dark haired girl wasn&#39;t sure.  She knew it wasn&#39;t her answer, it had to 
have been something else in the other girl&#39;s thoughts; a darkness just 
like Hotaru&#39;s.
 
          &quot;So?&quot;
 
          The photographer winced at the gruffness of the rogue&#39;s voice; 
she had never seen Makoto become angry and it scared her slightly.  
Hotaru often got the vibe from the tall teen that she lived in a world 
of black and white where no such shades as grey existed; if she was 
angry, she was probably raging.
 
      It was true she hadn&#39;t known her that long, but it felt like a 
long time, like the two were old friends in a past life simply catching 
up after so many years apart.  Revenge was no doubt the first thing on 
the tomboy&#39;s mind, which made sense because just like Hotaru, she&#39;d lost 
everyone, lost the love and lost a huge part of herself.  Everything 
seemed clear now.
 
      &quot;I want revenge.&quot; Hotaru found it wasn&#39;t so hard to voice it after 
all and even felt better when she got it out of her mouth, like a good 
cleaning at the dentist.
       
      Makoto grunted in her response, kicking a stone down the sidewalk 
and watching it bounce off a trash can.  The photographer looked up to 
see the large fountain in front of the Old Town Library.
       
      &quot;Where are we going?&quot;  She knew they were nearing the edge of the 
town and beyond that was just the warehouse district-most of which had 
been abandoned.  Without warning the rogue stopped.  The pale girl 
stopped as well when she noticed and watched the tomboy curiously.  They 
were right at the edge, one could almost see the line from where Juuban 
stopped and the district began.  The road and sidewalk were cracked and 
wore down from lack of finances from the city; they only repaired to 
that edge and nothing beyond.
       
      Emerald eyes were half-lidded as they stared out into the bleak 
area.  Hotaru followed her gaze and saw nothing but trash and the sides 
of the warehouse buildings, littered with broken windows from kids 
throwing rocks at them no doubt.  She shook her black spiky hair and 
turned back towards the rogue.  There was some significance out there 
for the chestnut haired girl, but Hotaru knew not what.
       
      Makoto met her gaze this time and her features were less hardened, 
almost sympathetic as she spoke, &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s such a coincidence.  
With them, there are no coincidences.  Still, if you want revenge, then 
when the time comes, you shall have it.&quot;
       
      A truck drove by, from above a small flock of birds flew overhead, 
their chirping and cawing meaningless in such a desolate area.  Time 
crawled to an imminent halt and purple eyes darkened, watching the 
tomboy with such a ferocious gaze that she almost felt she could take 
her justice with just the snap of her fingers.  Makoto smiled, knowing 
she had seen death himself in those dark orbs.
       
      Her voice was lower now, a profound whisper emanating from the 
depths of the rogue&#39;s lungs, &quot;You will have it.&quot;
 
--------------------------------------------------
 
          Utena finally managed to drag Minako back to the living area, 
apologizing profusely to the blue haired genius for their lurid behavior 
in the hallway while successfully ignoring the laughing smirk on 
Michiru&#39;s face.  The blonde had objected, of course, but eventually gave 
in, laughing and trying to tickle her pink haired prince as they walked 
away, leaving the other two girls behind.
 
          &quot;At least Naru will be happy to see that Utena will be, for 
the time being, otherwise occupied-which gives her more alone time with 
odango.&quot;  The elegant teen looked over her shoulder to find her 
companion still blushing and looking somewhat fretful.  &quot;A penny for 
your thoughts, Ami-chan?&quot;
 
          A sigh escaped the small girl&#39;s lips and she slumped over 
slightly.  Michiru moved closer to the girl, gently placing her arm over 
Ami&#39;s narrow shoulders and then squeezing her.
 
          &quot;Makoto is a tricky one, isn&#39;t she?&quot;
 
          Baby blue eyes shot up to meet teasing aquamarines.  Ami 
regarded the elegant teen for several seconds before lowering her gaze 
allowing a faint smile to cross over her features.  Michiru was 
immediately reminded of the Mona Lisa and was equally perplexed as she 
didn&#39;t know even a hint of the slightest thought going through her good 
friend&#39;s mind.
 
          She decided to try another angle, &quot;Her kissing was just so-so 
then?&quot;
 
          This gave the aqua haired girl the reaction she was desired as 
a deep blush spread across the short girl&#39;s cheeks.  The tall girl 
chuckled as Ami pulled a small hanky out of her skirt pocket and then 
gently tore her glasses away from her face, polishing them heedlessly.  
Michiru watched the girl for another few seconds before taking pity on 
her.
 
          &quot;I apologize, you&#39;re just so easy to fluster.  I think Haruka 
is rubbing off on me,&quot; the artist smiled and patted her underclassman&#39;s 
shoulder consolingly.  &quot;But just to prepare you, though she hasn&#39;t yet 
tried tonight, Haruka will no doubt make an attempt to hassle you for 
details on last night.  Since Makoto isn&#39;t one to share or even react to 
anything we say to her, Ruka&#39;ll see you as a consolation prize.&quot;
 
          The blue haired girl smiled, replacing her rimless frames and 
the hanky to their original homes, and then met with aqua eyes as she 
spoke, &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind.&quot;
 
          Once again, Michiru could not read the small girl&#39;s face and 
wondered exactly what had gone on the previous night to make the 
normally frenetic and easily embarrassed teen become so calm and 
indifferent.
 
          &quot;Ami, you and her didn&#39;t...&quot;  The artist didn&#39;t finish her 
sentence but left the innuendo riding through the thick sound waves of 
her voice.
 
          Ami jumped and gawked at the aqua haired girl, &quot;No!&quot;  The look 
of shock on the girl&#39;s face caused Michiru to laugh again and she 
covered her face to be polite.
 
          &quot;Gomen.&quot;
 
          &quot;Hrmph.&quot;
 
          The two girls finally began to walk back towards the living 
room, side by side.  There was still a deep red covering the small 
girl&#39;s round face and the aqua haired girl contained her amusement 
inside her head.  She outwardly showed genuine sympathy towards the 
girl, patting the soft blue crop atop her head.
 
          From outside came the sounds of laughing and hooting followed 
by the short bursts of screaming from the fiery Miko.  Ami shared a 
quick look with Michiru as both of them burst out giggling.
 
          The small girl stopped, still several feet from the entrance 
to the living room.  Inside the room they could hear laughter and 
voices.  Noticing the lack of presence by her side, the aqua haired teen 
stopped walking as well, turning to give Ami a quizzical look.
 
          &quot;Michiru,&quot; Ami&#39;s eyes wouldn&#39;t meet the other girl&#39;s and 
instead, focused on a small figure of a shrine maiden pouring water into 
a bird bath that was sitting inside a hollowed out ledge in the wall.  
She shifted from foot to foot, feeling the boards beneath her feet creak 
slightly causing a frown to cover her face.
 
          &quot;Michiru, do you think Rei-chan has been acting odd lately?  I 
just... she hasn&#39;t seemed herself in the past week.&quot;
 
          An annoyed sound escaped the artist&#39;s lips, aqua eyes looking 
away from the genius and to the opposite wall which held a cloth scroll 
covered in ancient Japanese figures and writing.  There was a loud crash 
just outside the door past the living room and several feet down the 
hall from where the two girls were standing.  Michiru looked over her 
shoulder briefly, before turning back towards the scroll.
 
          &quot;I wonder if there is something going on with her.  Whatever 
it is, she&#39;s not sharing.  Quite frankly, though, I have feeling she 
should not share it.&quot;  The tall girl chewed on her lower lip, sighing 
softly before continuing, &quot;She has visions, right?&quot;
 
          Ami murmured that she did, still not looking away from the 
figure.
 
          &quot;Well, maybe she&#39;s seen something.&quot;
 
          &quot;That seems logical, but she ought to share it with... one of 
us.&quot;
 
          Michiru noted that the girl was about to say &#39;share it with 
me.&#39;  Rei was the girl&#39;s best friend, it would only seem natural that 
she would want the raven haired girl to share things with her; the older 
girl thought that she ought not to be ashamed about it.  Having had 
enough of the scroll, Michiru brought her eyes back towards the blue 
haired girl who still had not stopped gazing at the figure.
 
          &quot;Perhaps she wants to confirm it first?  Or maybe it doesn&#39;t 
apply to any of us and doesn&#39;t want to burden anyone with it, you know 
how fiercely independent she can be.&quot;  The elegant teen stopped herself 
from continuing, thinking she&#39;d better not blurt out her own opinion on 
Rei&#39;s behavior towards Ami.
 
          Baby blue eyes finally tore themselves from the small Miko, 
the worry line evident at the crease of her brow.  &quot;You&#39;re probably 
right.&quot;  She was met face to face with a smiling Michiru.
 
          &quot;If you&#39;re concerned, you should talk to her about it, I&#39;m 
sure she&#39;d share with you.&quot;  This seemed to cause a torrent of reactions 
from the small girl which confused the artist.  Ami became a mixture of 
pride, pain, and content all rolled into the twisting and contorting 
facial muscles upon her delicate, pale and round face.
 
          Before the aqua haired teen could respond though, the door 
down the hall burst open and a dark haired boy came through it falling 
to the floor with his face covered in blood.  The small girl behind her 
gasped and reflexively, Michiru moved in front of her, trying to protect 
her.
 
          Everyone inside the living room became quiet, followed by the 
sounds of footsteps with Utena sticking her head out into the hall.  She 
jumped out in front of the young man, who appeared to be unconscious at 
the moment.
 
          &quot;Haruka?!  Rei?!&quot;  The pink haired girl yelled at the open 
door when she noticed a dark figure standing outside of it.  Michiru 
wondered if the racer had merely gotten physical in trying to move all 
the unwanted guests off the property.  She peered over Utena&#39;s shoulder, 
squinting into the darkness.  
 
          Her jaw dropped when she saw who it was.  Behind her, she felt 
the blue haired girl move and saw her step beside her out of the corner 
of her eye.  Ami had her hands up to her mouth and her eyes were a 
flurry of blue snow flakes.
 
      The small girl breathed in sharply, only one word escaping her 
lips, the sound of it whisked away through a non-existing breeze as she 
exhaled.
       
      &quot;Makoto.&quot;
 
---------------------------------------------------------
 
          &quot;Konban-wa Utena-san, Michiru...&quot;  Emerald eyes rested 
comfortably on the blue haired girl, &quot;... and happy birthday, Ami.&quot;
 
          The three girls were completely silent, still gawking at the 
tomboy who was now bending down and slinging the unconscious boy&#39;s arm 
around her neck.
 
          &quot;Utena-san, would you mind giving me a hand here?&quot;  Makoto had 
the boy half way up and looked like she could easily carry him back 
outside.  The basketball player sighed, relaxing her stance and moving 
over to the chestnut haired girl, grabbing the boy&#39;s other arm and 
pulling him up.  Once they steadied him between one another, the rogue 
looked back over her shoulder, &quot;We&#39;ll be right back, so don&#39;t go 
anywhere.&quot;
 
          &quot;Utena-chan what happened out h-...&quot;  Minako stopped part way 
out into the hall when she saw the scene.  Her jaw dropped open slightly 
and it looked like she was about to comment when several other girls 
poked their heads out as well.  There were many gasps and a few actually 
looked back towards the blue haired girl, trying to gauge her reaction.
 
          It was common knowledge now that &#39;The New Transfer&#39; had a 
thing for the local genius.  Even though they were Ami&#39;s friends, they 
were still curious about the interactions between the two girls and were 
always thirsty for any new gossip.  An unconscious, bloody nosed young 
man bursting through the door of the shrine only to be shortly followed 
by Kino Makoto would definitely be the talk of the school on Tuesday.
 
          Michiru sighed heavily, relaxing her stance as Utena and 
Makoto dragged the boy back through the door.  She gave annoyed looks to 
the girls in the doorway and began to usher them back inside in the 
living room.  Minako stayed out in the hallway next to Ami, watching her 
with a worried look on her face.
 
          &quot;What do you think that was all about?&quot;  She asked the blue 
haired girl.
 
          The genius shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;
 
          Minako tapped her finger against her lips as she considered 
the implications of the rogue crashing the small girl&#39;s birthday party 
by beating up some poor sap.  From what she&#39;d observed of Makoto, this 
didn&#39;t seem like her style at all, as she had yet to become hands on 
when challenged by someone.  Her strength was her ability to create a 
fear where there was no fear, making the other person believe she held 
power and sway over him or her even if she truly didn&#39;t.
 
          &quot;You&#39;re happy to see her?&quot;  Quirking an eyebrow, Minako smiled 
as her shy friend predictably blushed.  &quot;There&#39;s no reason to be 
embarrassed, she is quite a sexy alpha wolf.&quot;  Ami became redder.  
&quot;Though, she could have planned a better entrance than that.&quot;
 
          &quot;Should I have thrown a rose at her instead?&quot;  The rogue&#39;s 
rough voice cut through the darkness and was shortly followed by the 
rogue herself, Utena in her wake looking plenty confused.
 
          The volleyball player scoffed at the notion, but then smiled 
and continued with a playful banter in her voice, &quot;It would have been 
more romantic than throwing a bloodied guy at her.  Though I must say, 
Kino-san, what you lack in creativity, you make up for in determination 
and perseverance.  What is it they say?  Actions talk about loud words.&quot;
 
          An annoyed, but amused sigh came from behind the chestnut 
haired girl.
 
          Makoto raised a chestnut eyebrow at the blonde girl and 
smirked slightly as she responded, &quot;Carpe diem, quam minimum credula 
postero.&quot;
 
          &quot;Huh?&quot; Minako&#39;s eyebrows scrunched together, her confusion all 
too evident.
 
          &quot;Seize the day and put no trust in tomorrow,&quot; Ami&#39;s quiet 
voice spoke up from behind the blonde teen causing emerald eyes to 
capture baby blues.  Makoto smiled softly, prompting a smile and blush 
from the blue haired girl.
 
          Utena brushed past the tall girl, grinning at Minako who was 
smiling back and forth between the two.  The basketball player laced her 
fingers through Minako&#39;s and had her breath taken away when dazzling 
blue eyes caught her own.  Smiling, the blonde squeezed her girlfriend&#39;s 
hand and then turned back towards the rogue.
 
          &quot;C&#39;mon in and join us, Makoto, we won&#39;t bite... much,&quot;  After 
flashing the green eyed girl her pearly white teeth, Minako dragged the 
pink haired girl back into the living room, looking back over her 
shoulder suggestively and teasingly.
 
          The rogue felt her lip rise slightly and nearly laughed, 
deciding against it at the last second and settling for a light grunt 
instead.  She eyed the small blue haired girl out of the corner of her 
eye, appreciatively taking in the dark blue skirt and the form fitting, 
slate-colored, long-sleeved top that was cut low on the neck.
 
          &quot;Are you feeling better today?&quot;
 
          Ami let out the breath she&#39;d been holding, relaxing her body 
slightly as she responded, &quot;I&#39;m doing fine.&quot;  She took a step towards 
the rogue, looking down at the floor shyly, &quot;Was all this your doing?&quot;  
Ami gestured around, referring to the chaos outside.
 
          Makoto chuckled and closed the gap between her and the blue 
haired girl, &quot;Not at all, you&#39;d be well aware if it were my handy work.&quot;
 
          The genius let out a breathless laugh, feeling a genuine smile 
cross over her face.  She believed the taller girl.
 
          &quot;And that guy?&quot;
 
          &quot;Wrong place, wrong time.&quot;  A gasp escaped Ami&#39;s lips as she 
watched the rogue pull her hand up and kiss the palm softly.
 
          She bit her lip and smiled sweetly at the tomboy, &quot;You&#39;re 
doing it, again.&quot;
 
          Gripping onto the small girl&#39;s hand, Makoto pulled her closer 
to her, &quot;Doing what?&quot;
 
          Ami felt her breath catch in her throat, &quot;Y-your split 
personalities...&quot;  She blushed as she felt herself pressed against the 
taut body of her... girlfriend?  Baby blue eyes looked downwards, a 
blush crossing the blue haired girl&#39;s face at the thought.  They hadn&#39;t 
made any official declaration, but it seemed appropriate.
 
          Emerald eyes narrowed at the genius, dancing lightly, &quot;We 
better get me in there and introduced, what do you say?&quot;
 
          The blue haired girl managed a nod and frowned deeply at the 
loss of contact from the rogue as Makoto moved away.  It was a curious 
state though, Ami thought, how much calmer she felt overall since last 
night.  And even if her heart was racing a million light years per 
second at the moment, that overall sense of peace and security still 
vibrated sincerely through her body.
 
          &quot;Ami?&quot;  The genius looked up suddenly to find the softened, 
loving gaze so naturally assembled across Makoto&#39;s softly handsome face.
 
          She smiled again and moved forward, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;</pre>
