<a href="../crossover/sillyass-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Michiru looked down at her frantic young friend fondly. &quot;So you and 
Juri are going out for dinner tomorrow night?&quot; she confirmed.

Ami was blushing furiously as she nodded. With a shaky breath she 
confessed, &quot;I&#39;ve never done this sort of thing before.&quot;

Michiru blinked, &quot;I always thought you and Makoto...&quot;

Ami shook her head no, blushing brighter.

&quot;Sit down before you faint,&quot; Michiru guided her to a chair. &quot;So what 
do you want to have happen between the two of you?&quot; she asked her 
gently. At Ami&#39;s shocked glance she continued, &quot;Do you just want to be 
friends, or something... more?&quot;

Ami was looking down at the floor as she whispered, &quot;More.&quot;

&quot;And does Juri...?&quot; Michiru asked.

Ami looked up at her shyly. &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; she said with a little 
smile, &quot;but she did say I was cute when I concentrate.&quot;

Michiru smiled, &quot;That&#39;s true.&quot; She paced thoughtfully, &quot;A dress!&quot;

&quot;Dress?&quot; Ami echoed.

&quot;I think Juri will be wearing pants when you go out, so pick one of 
your dresses out,&quot; Michiru nodded firmly. She cupped Ami&#39;s chin and 
tilted her face up slightly, &quot;Comne over before your date, and I&#39;ll do 
your make- up for you.&quot;

&quot;Make-up?&quot; Haruka walked in, looking at them curiously. &quot;Why does she 
need your help with her make-up?&quot; she asked.

&quot;She&#39;s got a date with Arisugawa,&quot; Michiru smiled.

Haruka stopped, an odd look on her face. &quot;She&#39;s going out with Juri?&quot; 
she repeated.

&quot;We have a date for tomorrow night,&quot; Ami said quietly, looked at 
Haruka worriedly.

Haruka smiled, &quot;Sorry.&quot; She looked up at Michiru, &quot;I have to go out 
for a bit.&quot; With that, she was out of the door in moments.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Ami sweatdropped.

An hour or so later and Juri was leaving the fencing hall with a 
bounce in her step. Winning her matches would have been most peoples 
guss about why, but there was another reason Juri was happy. &#39;I&#39;m 
going on a date with Ami,&#39; she thought with a grin.

Juri walked by an alcove, when two hands grabbed her and yanked her 
into the shadows. She strugled for a moment, and quickly came face to 
face with a clearly irritable Haruka.

&quot;Haruka?&quot; Juri looked at her in surprise.

&quot;What&#39;s going on between you and Ami Mizuno?&quot; Haruka asked 
dangerously, keeping a firm grip on Juri&#39;s shirt.

&quot;She asked me out on a date,&quot; Juri blinked. This was a side of Haruka 
that Juri hadn&#39;t seen before, and it was making her a bit nervous.

&quot;And what are your intentions?&quot; Haruka narrowed her eyes.

&quot;Uh.. what?&quot; Juri blinked.

Haruka abruptly let go of Juri&#39;s shirt as she said, &quot;Ami Mizuno is a 
friend of mine, Juri. She&#39;s a good hearted, sweet kid, and I don&#39;t 
want to see her be hurt.&quot;

Juri smiled at her friend tentatively, &quot;I have no intention of hurting 
her.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Haruka nodded, &quot;because if you hurt her, I&#39;ll hurt you.&quot; 
Having said her piece, Haruka turned and walked away.

&#39;Well, that was interesting,&#39; Juri thought.

The next day ran by quickly for both of them, and soon the time for 
the dinner had nearly arrived. In her dorm room Ami took a deep 
breath, looking into her mirror nervously. &#39;My hair&#39;s too short,&#39; she 
thought despairingly, the small curls tickling her neck. The make-up 
Michiru had applied was subtle, highlighting her bright blue eyes. She 
wore a white blouse, and a long blue skirt swished around her legs as 
she moved.

The door bell chimed, and Ami answered it, taking her time so as not 
to seem too eager. Juri stood there larger than life, dark slacks 
hugging her hips and long legs, a white shirt tucked into the 
waistband. Her orange hair fell in graceful curls over her shoulders 
and down her back. And a smile of pleasure was lighting up her face.

&quot;You look lovely,&quot; Juri&#39;s voice was husky.

&quot;So do you,&quot; Ami looked up at her happily.

Juri offered her arm, &quot;Shall we?&quot; Ami slid her aerm into Juri&#39;s, and 
they walked down the hallway together. They rode the elevator down and 
took a short walk out front before Juri gently helped her into the 
waiting taxi.

&quot;So where are we going?&quot; Ami asked her as they sat together in the 
back seat. Juri&#39;s hand rested on her own, bringing a shiver to the 
smaller woman.

&quot;I thought about the dining hall,&quot; Juri smiled, &quot;but it&#39;s not very 
private.&quot; She looked out at the setting Sun, the light shining on her 
face, &quot;So I&#39;ve made other arrangements.&quot;

Juri looked over at Ami cautiously, seeing the smile on her pretty 
face. Her breath had caught in her throat when Ami had answered the 
door in that dress, and the sweet smiles that Ami kept giving her were 
taking her breath away.

&quot;A surprise, I take it?&quot; Ami asked softly.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Juri chuckled.

The taxi puled up in front of a small house and Juri paid the driver 
as well as giving a generous tip. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Priss Asagiri nodded, 
&quot;just call, and I&#39;ll be back.&quot; With that, she was gone.

Ami looked over at the cottage, &quot;Who owns this?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve rented it for tonight,&quot; Juri smiled, holding the door open for 
Ami.

They walked into a perfectly set up dining room, and Juri led Ami over 
to a seat, holding the chair out for her. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ami smiled up 
at her.

&quot;I&#39;ll go check on dinner,&quot; Juri smiled down at her. She strode out iof 
the room down the hallwway, then stuck her head in the kitchen, &quot;How&#39;s 
it going?&quot;

Shampoo pushed her long purple hair back, &quot;Near ready.&quot;

Ukyo nodded her agreement, &quot;Five minutes, Arisugawa.&quot;

Shampoo looked at the boyish young woman beside her, &quot;Ukyo good cook.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not so bad yourself,&quot; Ukyo grinned.
