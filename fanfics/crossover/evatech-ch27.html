<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 27 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/evatech-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>On board the ships of Breetai&#39;s fleet, something began
to change. The soldiers monitoring the SDF-1 heard the
strange thing Micronians called music, and were moved
by it. Carefully, secretly, they copied the recordings
to show to others, who then passed them on as well.
Unseen and silently like a disease, it spread
throughout the ships... with a few notable exceptions.

&quot;What is this?&quot; Quamzin demanded, the slim Zentradi
looking violently ill as he shut down the recording
device he had taken from a officer under his command.

&quot;It&#39;s something Micronians call music,&quot; the grovelling
man managed.

&quot;Fool,&quot; Quamzin easily crushed the recording in his
hand, &quot;it&#39;s clearly a weapon, designed to weaken us.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; he started.

Smoothly drawing his pistol Quamzin aimed and fired
with cold relentlessness, sending the warrior crashing
to the floor and splattering blood on the bulkhead.
Putting his pistol away he coldly called out, &quot;Someone
clean that up.&quot;

As his soldiers rushed in to clean up the mess Quamzin
stalked back to the captain&#39;s chair even as Breetai
dronned on in the background. &quot;As of now,&quot; the silver
helmed firgure said gravely, &quot;all communications with
the main fleet are forbidden, until we more fully
understand the effects of this Micronian music.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Quamzin wondered aloud, &quot;do you think it&#39;s a
weapon too?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Breetai acknowledged, &quot;but it clearly
has done something to the officers who were exposed to
it.&quot;

&quot;So what steps can we take to preserve our crews?&quot;
another captain asked over the communications link,
Quamzin&#39;s eyes landing a moment on the bloody smear
that marked his own fallen officer.

&quot;Contain them away from other soldiers for now,&quot;
Breetai ordered.

&#39;Fool,&#39; Quamzin mused, &#39;your ship will be contaminated
before you know it. Harsh action is required to stop
this.&#39;

&quot;Also, do not listen to the music yourself,&quot; Breetai
added, &quot;it might dangerously change your ability to
reason in combat.&quot;

&#39;Really?&#39; Quamzin felt amused, &#39;I wonder if the effect
is as strong as chewing leaves from Protoculture? I
may have to try it.&#39;

&quot;And what of our infiltrator?&quot; Azonia asked, the
commander of the Angel Brigade looking on dangerously.

Breetai looked grim, &quot;Depending on the degree of her
contamination to music, we may have to abandon her.&quot;

&#39;Oooh, Azonia doesn&#39;t like hearing that,&#39; Quamzin
mused, smiling to himself slightly. Personally, he was
glad that any of the arrogant angels might be gone,
but the rest of the fleet might disagree.

Azonia hammered her hand onto her desk as she said
angrilly, &quot;That is not acceptable, Lord Breetai.&quot;

&quot;We may not have a choice,&quot; Breetai replied. He
hesitated a moment, &quot;All our attempts to communicate
with her have failed.&quot;

&#39;I wonder if dear Miriya was killed aboard Zor&#39;s
ship?&#39; Quamzin mused, &#39;Or maybe the music has driven
her mad. It would be so amusing if that were so...&#39;

&quot;Request permision to lead an assault into Zor&#39;s
ship,&quot; Azonia said seriously, &quot;we will retrieve Miriya
and discover the secrets of the ship.&quot;

&#39;Or die trying,&#39; Quamzin thought, smiling.

&quot;Denied,&quot; Breetai shook his head, &quot;the secrets of that
vessel are too important to us all to lose them in a
brute force attack. Why do you think I haven&#39;t
committed our forces to a overwhelming assault before
now?&quot;

&#39;And to think, I merely thought you lacked will,&#39;
Quamzin silently mocked him. Omce the meeting was over
Quamzin switched his screen to an outside view, gazing
at Zor&#39;s ship as it floated just beyond the blue green
planet&#39;s atmosphere.

The launch of the vessel had been quite impressive,
the massive ship rising up and away from the
Micronian&#39;s home and sweeping through the clouds into
the clean void of space. Now it waited, mocking their
ambitions as it lumbered around the planet in a low
orbit.

&quot;So,&quot; Quamzin mused to himself aloud, &quot;you are the
ones who killed my comrade, Khyron.&quot; Honestly, Quamzin
would have thought the backstabber to be unkillable,
but somehow the pilots of the humans had done it,
reducing his officers pod to wreckage. &quot;We will meet,&quot;
he murmured, &quot;and I will see you pay for it.&quot;

o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o

&quot;Ah-choo!&quot; Rei Ayanami sneezed suddenly, then the red
eyed young woman blinked a few times in confusion.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Asuka Langley asked, the redhead
reaching out to brush Rei&#39;s light blue hair from her
eyes.

&quot;Something suddenly made me sneeze,&quot; Rei looked
sheepish as she stretched out beside Asuka in the bed.
She smiled as Asuka cupped her chin, kissing her,
&quot;Aren&#39;t you affraid of catching something?&quot;

ASuka chuckled as she cuddled close to the smaller,
naked woman. &quot;By now, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re sharing
anything we may have,&quot; she noted impishly.

Rei blushed, &quot;Asuka.&quot;

Chuckling quietly Asuka rolled over on her back,
holding Rei close. &quot;In fact, I was going to
suggest...&quot; Asuka trailed off.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Rei looked up at Asuka questioningly.

Asuka actually looked a bit nervous as she asked,
&quot;What would you think of moving in together? We could
use my room or yours...&quot;

Rei surprised her by nearly crawling up Asuka to kiss
her feverdly.

&quot;You approve?&quot; Asuka asked once Rei let her go.

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Rei beamed. Blushing a bit she admitted, &quot;I
was going to ask you that, once I got up my nerve.&quot;

Asuka hugged her, chuckling, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking of
asking for a while, too.&quot; She paused, &quot;Now for the
hard part.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Rei looked at her curiously.

&quot;Who&#39;s quarters do we move into?&quot; Asuka asked mildly.

There was a moment of dead silence then Rei admitted,
&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that.&quot;

&quot;My rooms are pretty cluttered,&quot; Asuka admitted,
looking around at the disaster area they were lying
in, with clothes laying about, paperwork dumped on the
desk and items hanging off random pieces of furniture.

Rei nodded reluctantly, &quot;I like your rooms, but you do
have a lot of stuff.&quot; She frowned, &quot;I don&#39;t have so
much, but...&quot;

&quot;Your room&#39;s tiny,&quot; Asuka sighed. She looked curiously
at Rei, &quot;How come you never got your room upgraded
when you were promoted?&quot;

&quot;Never saw the point,&quot; Rei shrugged.

&quot;Well, my suit&#39;s closer to the flight deck...&quot; Asuka
mused.

Rei chuckled, &quot;But mine&#39;s closer to Macross city.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Asuka conceded.

&quot;Why not request a new room?&quot; Rei suggested after a
moment. She smiled slightly, &quot;We can request a larger
one, too.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t I think of that?&quot; Asuka chuckled softly.

Rei sighed as she cuddled close, &quot;I never fell in love
with you for your brains.&quot;

Asuka groaned, &quot;Oooh, mean.&quot;

Just then, they heard the sound of knocking on the
door. &quot;Oh no,&quot; Rei sighed.

&quot;GO AWAY,&quot; Asuka bellowed, but the knocking continued.

&quot;You&#39;d better answer it,&quot; Rei sighed, &quot;it could be
important.&quot;

&quot;It better be,&quot; Asuka scowled as she got up out of
bed, hunting around for a robe to cover up her
nakedness.

&quot;Nice butt,&quot; Rei teased as Asuka bent over to pick up
the robe&#39;s belt.

&quot;Perv,&quot; Asuka chuckled fondly. With a fierce look she
strode to the door, swinging it open as she demanded.
&quot;What is it?!&quot;

Makoto Hyuga stepped back, the slightly nerdy older
officer going pale. &quot;Ah, hello ma&#39;am...&quot; he started
nervously.

&quot;Get on with it,&quot; Asuka growled.

Looking over Asuka&#39;s shoulder he saw Rei laying in bed
and Makoto realized exactly what he&#39;d interrupted.
Blushing he stammered, &quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry!&quot;

Asuka cracked her knuckles, &quot;This had better be good.&quot;

&quot;Your friend Miriya,&quot; Makoto blurted out nervously,
&quot;is in the brig. I was requested to come get you.&quot;

&quot;Minmei&#39;s girlfriend?&quot; Rei looked curious as she
wrapped a sheet around her and joined them, &quot;Why
doesn&#39;t Minmei just bail her out?&quot;

&quot;Because Minmei&#39;s in lock up with her,&quot; Makoto
explained.

&quot;Oy,&quot; Asuka sighed.

To be continued...

Note: Quamzin is the Japanese name for Khyron. Having
foolishly killed Khyron off earlier, I needed a
similar character, so I&#39;m using his original version,
sorta. lol</pre>
