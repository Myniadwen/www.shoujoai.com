<h1>Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo (part 4 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/etercity-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The building was one of the oldest in Crystal Tokyo, and rumors 
persisted that it dated back to the twentieth century. A former 
warehouse that had been greatly converted over the years, it stood on 
the outskirts of the city. Above the door an animated hologram of a 
locket opening up to reveal a pretty girl hangs in midair, and just 
above it the words, Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.

Erica Tenoh smiled, waving to the red headed woman standing guard at 
the door, &quot;Hey, Kei, how&#39;s the Lovely Angel?&quot;

&quot;Still being repaired from our last mission,&quot; Kei shrugged, and smiled 
at Hotaru and Usagi, &quot;It&#39;s good to see you, ladies.&quot; She waved them 
in, smiling as she saw the pink haired Usagi reach out to take 
Hotaru&#39;s hand.

&quot;I wonder where Yuri is?&quot; Usagi asked Erica quietly.

&quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; the blue haired girl smiled up at the 
three of them.

&quot;Captain Ruri?&quot; Hotaru blinked, her black hair blowing around her 
gently, &quot;aren&#39;t you supposed to be up on the Nadesico-4?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got a few days leave,&quot; Ruri smiled slightly and shrugged a bit, 
&quot;and the Queen doesn&#39;t seem to mind my moonlighting.&quot;

The place was bustling as they went in, filled with women of various 
ages and types. Erica looked around as they walked towards the bar, 
noting a few natives of Jurai, a few from the Martian colonies, 
androids, aliens and even an immortal or two in the mob.

&quot;There&#39;s Sakura and Tomoyo,&quot; Usagi pointed out the two women sitting 
at one of the tables near the stairs. They looked happy, sipping their 
drinks as they talked quietly.

A tall, black haired woman stood behind the bar, giving them a smile 
as she said, &quot;Hi, my name&#39;s Mahoro, what can I get you?&quot;

&quot;Sake,&quot; both Usagi and Hotaru ordered, and Mahoro poured them both 
their first bowls of sake for good luck.

&quot;Whisky,&quot; Erica decided to try. The golden liquid was poured, and 
Erica looked at it a bit dubiously. &quot;Well, Haruka-papa likes it,&quot; she 
murmured, and took a drink. There was a long moment of silence, then 
Erica&#39;s eyes got very, very wide. She blinked watery eyes a few times, 
shaking her head and gasping.

&quot;Acquired taste?&quot; Usagi asked impishly.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Erica wheezed out.

Hotaru got up, shaking her head with a smile. &quot;Let&#39;s get a table,&quot; she 
suggested. The three found an empty spot by the dance floor, and in a 
few moments a dark haired girl arrived.

&quot;What can I get you?&quot; Yuri beamed, her long black hair reaching the 
top of her shorts. A battle bikini finished off the outfit, holding 
her fair-sized breasts in check.

&quot;Nachos and cheese,&quot; Erica smiled.

Usagi and Hotaru exchanged a glance, then Usagi smiled up at Yuri, 
&quot;Two lunches, please.&quot;

Yuri bounced off with a wave, &quot;Coming right up!&quot;

Across the bar a incredibly perky blonde was taking meal orders before 
charging across the dance floor at high speed. &quot;I&#39;ve never quite 
understood how Excel became immortal,&quot; Erica noted.

&quot;Cosmic accident,&quot; Hotaru drank her sake sparingly, &quot;apparently an 
avatar of the universe itself granted her and Hyatt eternal life by 
accident.&quot;

What looked like a mini-galaxy with female arms flew by them 
muttering, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m so embarrassed.&quot;

Everybody decided just to ignore that, and keep drinking.

Upstairs, a short way along the upper landing, there was a nicely 
decorated office. A woman with long brown hair studied a small hand 
held computer screen intently, not looking up as her door opened then 
shut.

&quot;Hello, Juri,&quot; Cyberdoll May smiled.

The tall, orange haired woman settled into one of the guest chairs, 
taking a moment to tug on her military style jacket. May looked over 
at Arisugawa Juri, taking in the relaxed smile and sense of peace that 
she seemed to carry with her. A simple golden band glinted on one 
finger, a symbol of a deep and long lasting partnership.

&quot;The place looks great, May,&quot; Juri smiled at the woman who she had 
asked to take over managing the Locket all those years ago.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; May smiled happily. She smirked slightly, &quot;How&#39;s 
Setsuna?&quot;

Juri blushed at the look she was getting from her old friend. &quot;Guess 
the roof-top story is still circulating,&quot; she sighed softly.

&quot;You have to admit,&quot; May chuckled, &quot;having a intimate moment with the 
Senshi of Time on a rooftop was not the wisest of ideas.&quot;

&quot;We got a bit carried away,&quot; Juri admitted.

May smiled, &quot;You&#39;re just lucky that the Puma sisters and Leona&#39;s last 
public exploit pushed you two off of the gossip columns.&quot; Deciding to 
be merciful she changed the subject, &quot;How are Ryouko and Ayeka doing?&quot;

&quot;Heh. Last I heard Emperor Tenchi&#39;s top diplomats were considering 
having a baby,&quot; Juri chuckled, &quot;but they can&#39;t decide who gets to 
carry the baby to term.&quot;

May had an very odd look on her face, &quot;I kind of doubt either of them 
would be all that suited to having a baby.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;ll have a chance to talk to them about it soon. They, along 
with Sasami and Minagi are coming to this big conference we&#39;re 
organizing up at the palace,&quot; Juri smiled. She grinned, &quot;I suspect 
we&#39;ll all come down and take over the Locket one night.&quot;

May smiled back, &quot;I&#39;ll look forward to that!&quot;

Juri looked more serious as she said, &quot;This isn&#39;t just a social call. 
May, do you remember a customer of the Locket named Victoria Ceres?&quot;

May looked thoughtful, then her eyes widened, &quot;The vampire?&quot; She 
leaned forward, &quot;What do you want with her?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, personally,&quot; Juri answered her with a wry smile, &quot;but Ami&#39;s 
been studying vampirism, and she thinks she might have found a partial 
cure.&quot;

&quot;The last I heard,&quot; May frowned, &quot;she was in what was Britain, but 
it&#39;s been a while.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri got up, taking a few steps towards the door. She paused 
there a moment to ask, &quot;Have you been dating?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; May answered softly.

Juri hesitated, almost as if she was weighing her words carefully, 
&quot;Keiko wouldn&#39;t want you to mourn her forever.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; May said quietly, not necessarily agreeing or disagreeing 
with Juri.

The Staff of Arisugawa&#39;s Locket: Kei and Yuri are from the original 
Dirty Pair. Ruri is from Martian Successor Nadesico. Excel and Hyatt 
are from Excel Saga. Mahoro is from Mahoromantic. And finally May is 
from Hand Maid May.
