&quot;Good morning, Lieutenant,&quot; Roy said cheerfully as Ranma entered his 
office.

&quot;Morning, Sir,&quot; Ranma said apprehensively.

&quot;Something on your mind?&quot; Roy asked her.

&quot;Sir, about last night...&quot; Ranma began.

&quot;I won&#39;t lie to you, Lieutenant, it&#39;s weird,&quot; Roy sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not sure 
how to interact with you. Male, female? I don&#39;t know. One thing I am 
sure of, your record speaks for itself. You&#39;re a solid combat pilot. 
You&#39;re not afraid to mix it up and you&#39;ve displayed courage and heroism 
under fire. You&#39;re the type of pilot I want flying with me. And one more 
thing I&#39;m sure of. I admire you greatly. Most people would have let what 
happened to you beat them, but you didn&#39;t. You sucked it up and by force 
of will and determination chose to make the most of the situation you 
found your self in. That took guts and a great deal of inner strength. 
Don&#39;t worry about it, Lieutenant. We&#39;ll find our groove as we work 
together.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Sir,&quot; Ranma said. &quot;That eases my mind a bit. And if it helps, 
you don&#39;t have to treat me any different than you would have yesterday. 
For all intents and purposes, especially professionally, I am female. It 
used to bug me when people treated me like it, but after the first 
couple of years I got used to it and accepted it. It is mostly who I am 
now.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Roy nodded. &quot;So are you ready to start learning your new 
bird?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely, Sir,&quot; Ranma grinned in anticipation.

&quot;Outstanding,&quot; Roy smiled. &quot;The VF-1 Valkyrie is like nothing you&#39;ve 
ever experienced before. It&#39;s almost 90 percent based on classified tech 
we obtained from the Visitor. With this aircraft you will be able to do 
things you can&#39;t imagine. It&#39;s powered by an all new power source that 
we barely understand even now. The level of pilot interface that can be 
achieved is so incredible that if you can manage it, you will hardly 
need controls to fly it...&quot; Roy spent the next couple of hours extolling 
the virtues and abilities of the VF-1.

&quot;An aircraft that will transform into a destriod-type mecha?&quot; Ranma said 
in wonder as Roy wound down. &quot;That&#39;s amazing.&quot;

&quot;It occurs to me that the two of you should get along pretty well, 
Lieutenant,&quot; Roy laughed. &quot;After all, you both share a transformational 
ability.&quot; Ranma snorted and rolled her eyes. Roy stood up and grabbed a 
12 inch stack of three flight manuals, dropping them in Ranma&#39;s lap. 
&quot;You need to study all those and become familiar with the systems. Now, 
would you like to see a VF-1? Currently we only have a few of the D 
models that we are using for flight trainers. The S, J, and A models are 
not expected to reach operational deployment for several months, but we 
have the D models and the simulators to get the pilots up to speed for 
when they are cleared for operations.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to see one, Sir,&quot; Ranma said, warily eyeing the thick books in 
her lap that she just knew were loaded with dry bore-me-to-tears 
technical info.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Lieutenant,&quot; Roy chuckled, seeing her looking at the 
manuals, &quot;you won&#39;t be expected to go through all that on your own. You 
have a couple more days while we wait for a few more transfers to arrive 
and then I&#39;m going to be starting the class that will make up Skull 
Squadron, my command. It wouldn&#39;t hurt to get a jump on it though.&quot;

&quot;Roger that, Sir,&quot; Ranma said in evident relief.

&quot;Let&#39;s go gawk at a Valkyrie, Saotome,&quot; Roy laughed.

(oO\O/Oo)

Ranma looked up from her contemplation of the stack of tech manuals on 
her coffee table when she heard a knock on the door. It was just after 
10 am and she had stalled studying the manuals for most of the morning. 
She had gotten up at 7 and proceeded to the mess to have breakfast. 
After that, she went to the gym and spent the better part of two hours 
in a grueling workout session which had included sparring with a couple 
of the marines she had trained with before. At 9:30, she had returned to 
her quarters and had been sitting there looking at the manuals for the 
last half hour trying to get herself in the right frame of mind to study 
them. Sighing, she rose and answered the door.

Lisa Hayes stood on the other side holding a large beach bag, dressed in 
a tank top and a pair of shorts. Ranma could see the straps of a bikini 
top underneath the tank top.

&quot;Hi, Ranma,&quot; Lisa said. &quot;I was just heading out to the beach. I know you 
have some down time before you start Veritech training classes so I 
thought I&#39;d ask if you wanted to join me?&quot;

&quot;Hi there, Lisa,&quot; Ranma said, looking from Lisa to the stack of manuals 
on the table. &quot;The beach, huh? Well, I was told to study those 
manuals...&quot;

&quot;You can always bring them with you,&quot; Lisa suggested hopefully.

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Ranma said thoughtfully. &quot;Let&#39;s see, hang out on the beach with 
my best friend, or sit in my quarters and read boring tech 
manuals...decisions, decisions...Okay, let me get changed and we&#39;ll go.&quot;

Ranma invited Lisa in to sit on the couch and disappeared into her 
bedroom. She came back out a couple of minute later in a pair of black 
BDU shorts and a baggy blue t-shirt with an F/A 18 in flight depicted on 
the back of it. Her flame red hair was gathered in a ponytail and pulled 
out the back of a hat with a similar F/A 18 on it.

&quot;You have your swimsuit on under that, right?&quot; Lisa asked when Ranma 
came in.

&quot;This is my swimsuit, Lisa,&quot; Ranma laughed.

&quot;I see I still have some work to do,&quot; Lisa said contemplatively as Ranma 
gathered the manuals and stuffed them in a gym bag.

&quot;What&#39;s that mean?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Remember what we talked about, about taking pride in yourself?&quot; Lisa 
asked.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ranma said, uncertain where this was going.

&quot;Well, you look like a reject from a grunge band,&quot; Lisa commented.

&quot;Gee, thanks, Lisa,&quot; Ranma quipped.

&quot;Well, I can see before we hit the beach we are going shopping,&quot; the 
taller woman announced. &quot;You have a fantastic body, Ranma. You should 
show it off properly.&quot;

&quot;Shopping?&quot; Ranma groaned. &quot;You mean I should wear a bikini? Sorry, 
Lisa, but I think that would attract the wrong sort of attention. I 
don&#39;t want to haveta fight off every guy on the beach that thinks he&#39;s 
god&#39;s gift, you know?&quot;

&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Lisa dismissed. &quot;Sure you might have to deflect a few 
advances, but you might also attract the right sort of attention as 
well.&quot;

&quot;Heh, like there is a right sort of attention for me, Lisa,&quot; Ranma 
sighed. &quot;You know how I feel about that. Any woman that was interested 
in me like this would be interested in a deception.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so that body is not really female?&quot; Lisa asked rhetorically.

&quot;Well, yeah, it is, you know that,&quot; Ranma admitted. &quot;But I was born a 
guy, no matter what I am now. What woman would be interested in a sex 
changing freak like me?&quot;

&quot;Some would be,&quot; Lisa sighed. &quot;But I see your point. You can&#39;t tell them 
the truth without risking your career and you don&#39;t feel like you can be 
in a relationship without them knowing the truth.&quot; Ranma nodded. &quot;You 
must be incredibly lonely.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, I have my career,&quot; Ranma replied, &quot;and I accepted long ago 
that my career would have to be enough for me.&quot;

&quot;Ranma, I...&quot; Lisa trailed off with an unreadable look on her face.

&quot;You what?&quot; Ranma prompted.

&quot;I understand,&quot; Lisa said finally. &quot;When Karl left, I dedicated myself 
to the SDF-1 program. I suppose I was hoping to get up there to Mars to 
see him again. Then he...we lost contact with Mars Base Sara. I thought 
all I had left was my career. At least I still have my friends, you and 
Claudia.&quot;

&quot;Always, Lisa,&quot; Ranma said with a smile. &quot;I&#39;ll be there for you whenever 
you need me.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Ranma,&quot; Lisa said with her own small smile. &quot;Right now I 
need you to come shopping with me for your swimsuit.&quot; Ranma groaned but 
acquiesced to the inevitable.

(oO\O/Oo)

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I let you talk me into this,&quot; Ranma said again in 
disbelief, tugging at one of the shoulder straps of her bikini top now 
worn under her tee. &quot;So where are we going anyway?&quot; Lisa giggled from 
the driver&#39;s seat of the blacked out government sedan.

&quot;You looked amazing in those bikini&#39;s we bought you,&quot; Lisa defended. 
&quot;You know you did, and you liked it or you wouldn&#39;t have bought them. 
Admit it. We are going to a hotel that has an agreement with the base 
here. They let military officers have access to their facilities, the 
pool and deck, the beach loungers, the restrooms and showers, and even 
the tiki bar.&quot;

&quot;You go there often?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;I try to go at least once a month when the weather is good,&quot; Lisa 
replied.

&quot;Once a month, huh?&quot; Ranma deadpanned. &quot;So often? How do you find the 
time?&quot;

&quot;Oh and like you are any better, Little Miss 
Hide-in-my-quarters-when-not-in-the-cockpit,&quot; Lisa shot back. Ranma 
laughed.

&quot;Touch&eacute;,&quot; Ranma conceded.

&quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Lisa grinned as they pulled into the parking lot of the 
rather luxurious hotel.

&quot;Wow, nice place,&quot; Ranma said.

&quot;It is,&quot; Lisa agreed as she shut off the car. &quot;Let&#39;s hit the beach, 
girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; Ranma said, stepping out and grabbing her gym bag full of 
manuals and beach accessories out of the backseat.

The two women headed toward the gate to the beachside of the hotel where 
there was a hotel security agent stationed to keep out non-guests. Lisa 
produced her military ID and Ranma did the same. The guard, dressed in a 
pith helmet, a crisp white shirt, black shorts, long white socks 
covering his calves, and white shoes, looked them over.

&quot;Commander, Lieutenant, it&#39;s a pleasure to have you here,&quot; the man said 
politely. &quot;You ladies enjoy yourselves.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Lisa said as they entered.

Lisa led them out on to the sundeck of the most elaborate pool Ranma had 
ever seen. It would have looked more like a lagoon than a pool if it 
weren&#39;t for the blue Marcite bottom. The long pool coiled around a 
couple of different rock islands that were beautifully landscaped with 
tropical vegetation. It had a very natural feel to it. The sundeck 
itself was bordered by immaculately manicured grass and landscaped with 
more tropical plants and ubiquitous palm trees. The beachside was 
delineated by a low wall and a shallow stream of flowing water for the 
purpose of keeping as much of the beach sand as possible off the deck 
and out of the pool. Off to one side was the mentioned tiki bar.

&quot;So do you want to head out on the beach, or set up on the deck?&quot; Lisa 
asked.

&quot;What do you usually do?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;Sometimes I do the beach, sometimes I do the deck,&quot; Lisa replied. &quot;We 
can do the deck today. It&#39;s closer to the bar anyway.&quot;

Ranma nodded and the pair found themselves a couple of vacant loungers. 
Lisa showed Ranma where to get hotel-provided towels to lay down on the 
chairs&#39; cushions. After securing and preparing their positions, Lisa 
pulled a small radio out of her bag and placed it on the low table 
between their chairs. Giving Ranma a smile she then stripped off her 
tank top leaving her upper half clad in only a bright orange bikini top 
that displayed her well-formed but modest breasts fetchingly. Turning 
away from Ranma who was seated on the edge of her chair watching Lisa, 
she proceeded to slowly take off her shorts, in the process practically 
sticking her orange high-cut bikini clad bottom in Ranma&#39;s face. Ranma, 
unable to look away, gulped and blushed as she got a great view of 
Lisa&#39;s beautiful derri&egrave;re.

&quot;Like what you see?&quot; Lisa grinned as she sent a smoky look over her 
shoulder, having paused before stepping out of her shorts.

&quot;Beautiful,&quot; Ranma said absently then turned red as a lobster as she 
realized she was caught staring at Lisa&#39;s bottom. Lisa smirked and 
finished removing her shorts.

&quot;Your turn,&quot; the taller woman chirped. Ranma gulped nervously.

&quot;Do I have to?&quot; Ranma stalled. &quot;I&#39;d feel like I was running around in my 
underwear.&quot; Lisa&#39;s reply was a half lidded glare. &quot;Oh alright,&quot; Ranma 
said after sweating under the glare for a moment.

Ranma stripped off her shirt, careful not to dislodge her hat and 
glasses. &#39;Turn about is fair play,&#39; she thought as she stood nervously 
to remove her BDU shorts. &#39;Not like it&#39;s gonna have the same effect, 
though.&#39; Ranma proceeded to give Lisa the same show that Lisa had given 
her. She nearly fell over when she glanced over her shoulder and saw 
Lisa&#39;s eyes were glued to her butt as much as her own where to Lisa&#39;s. 
Lisa grinned brightly when she saw she was caught looking.

&quot;Well, you are gorgeous, you know,&quot; Lisa giggled.

&quot;I...um...thanks,&quot; Ranma said, flustered. &quot;You too.&quot;

She stepped out of her shorts and nervously adjusted the high-cut red, 
yellow, and blue tropical floral print bikini bottom. Ranma felt 
extremely exposed and vulnerable. Her eyes darted around the deck, which 
was, perhaps, a mistake since she noticed several male eyes facing their 
way. She wanted to find a hole to crawl into.

&quot;Now lay down on your tummy,&quot; Lisa said, pulling out a bottle of 
sunscreen and distracting Ranma from her impending flight. &quot;I&#39;ll do you 
back and you can do mine.&quot;

Ranma swallowed again and mutely complied. Lisa came over and sat on the 
edge of Ranma&#39;s chair and undid the back of her bikini top.

&quot;Hey! What are you doing?&quot; Ranma hissed.

&quot;Quiet you,&quot; Lisa said, clearly amused. &quot;It&#39;s easier to put the 
sunscreen on this way. I&#39;ll put it back when I&#39;m done.&quot;

Ranma felt Lisa&#39;s hands begin to run the cool protective cream on to her 
back. The other woman&#39;s hands began to knead and massage the rigid well 
defined muscles of Ranma&#39;s back.

&quot;My goodness, you&#39;re so tense,&quot; Lisa said as she attacked a knot, 
digging into it and loosening it.

Ranma whimpered a little but began to relax and enjoy what Lisa was 
doing. She was feeling like an over-cooked noodle but she was brought 
back from her nearly asleep state when she felt Lisa&#39;s hands travel down 
her sides and rub the sides of her breasts where they were being 
squeezed out from beneath her chest. Ranma put it down to her 
imagination when the hands lingered a tad longer than necessary. The 
brunette&#39;s hands moved on though. She nearly squealed when Lisa&#39;s hands 
began to rub the lotion on to her bottom and dipped inside the edges of 
the bikini. They didn&#39;t linger here long though. Lisa then attacked the 
redhead&#39;s legs, massaging each calf muscle thoroughly before moving ever 
higher. As the brunette reached her upper thighs, Ranma began to feel a 
warm glow of heat between her legs. She felt an electric jolt run 
through her tummy as a hand inadvertently brushed across her intimate 
area. She was brought out of her daze of relaxed arousal as she felt her 
top being reconnected and her bottom patted.

&quot;My turn,&quot; Lisa said brightly.

Ranma shakily got up and noticed, to her chagrin, that her nipples were 
rock hard and visibly poking through the cups of her bikini top. 
Luckily, the print of the top camouflaged this unless someone was 
standing close to her. Glancing around, she noticed that several of the 
guys that had been sitting around the deck were now in the pool. 
Shrugging, she turned to Lisa, who was now laid out on her tummy 
awaiting Ranma&#39;s attention.

Ranma surveyed the woman before her. Lisa wasn&#39;t a martial artist, but 
she did work out regularly. While she had none of Ranma&#39;s lightly 
defined muscle mass and her curves were softer and smoother, she still 
had a trim and taut athletic figure. Her limbs were long and shapely and 
her lightly tanned skin was smooth and perfect. She could have been a 
successful model if that had been her interest.

&#39;She my best friend,&#39; Ranma reminded herself as she sat on the edge of 
Lisa&#39;s chair. &#39;I shouldn&#39;t be thinking about her like this. Besides, she 
likes guys.&#39;

Ranma&#39;s hands shook slightly as she reached out to begin applying the 
lotion. This was as intimate as she had ever been with anybody and it 
was going to be torture for her, she realized. &#39;Just a friend,&#39; Ranma 
reminded herself, attempting to suppress her attraction to the brunette.

&quot;Don&#39;t forget the strap,&quot; Lisa reminded as Ranma began to rub the lotion 
on.

Ranma swallowed several times, wanting nothing more than to just smear 
the cream on and be done with it, but she knew that wouldn&#39;t be fair to 
Lisa. She had to give as good as she got which meant taking her time and 
massaging the lotion into the brunette&#39;s skin in a slow torturous 
process. Rubbing in what she had on her hands, she deftly unhooked the 
back strap of Lisa&#39;s top and returned to the torture of caressing and 
kneading Lisa&#39;s soft skin. Trying not to think about what she was doing, 
she concentrated on turning each muscle group into relaxed putty. Lisa&#39;s 
soft moans of pleasure weren&#39;t doing her composure any good though.

Ranma skipped over Lisa&#39;s bottom and proceeded to her lower legs, 
massaging and kneading the muscles and skin as she worked her way up. 
She hesitated when she reached the woman&#39;s upper thighs.

&quot;Don&#39;t be shy,&quot; Lisa giggled as she felt the redhead hesitate. &quot;Take 
your time and finish. That feels really good.&quot; The brunette spread her 
legs a little to allow Ranma better access to her inner thighs, 
inadvertently allowing Ranma a good view of the contours at the apex of 
her legs under the bikini bottom.

Ranma wanted to sob from the sweet agony she was in. Did Lisa not 
understand how torturous this was for her?

What Ranma didn&#39;t know was that Lisa was in a similar state. The redhead 
had no clue how close she was to being thrown down and ravished. Only 
Lisa&#39;s lingering feelings for Karl and her sense of wonder at being this 
strongly attracted to another woman was keeping her in check. She had 
always felt a connection to the little redhead and felt very comfortable 
around her. She didn&#39;t feel the need to hide behind the disciplined 
fa&ccedil;ade of a military officer around Ranma. As she had felt with Karl, 
she felt free to be Lisa Hayes the young woman with Ranma, instead of 
Lisa Hayes, the scion of a hundred years of Hayes military tradition.

When Karl was in the picture, she and Ranma had been close friends. Now 
that closeness was rapidly turning into a strong attraction. Lisa 
seriously doubted her control had Ranma been in that delicious male form 
of hers. She quickly suppressed an image of her slithering over that 
strong masculine body like some kind of sensual snake. As Ranma&#39;s 
tentative feminine hands caressed her ever closer toward the source of 
pleasant heat emanating from between her legs, Lisa began to realize 
that her attraction to Ranma made very little distinction between 
Ranma&#39;s two forms. She might have been more comfortable with the idea of 
wanting Ranma in male form, but she was forced to accept the idea of 
being intimate with Ranma&#39;s female form was just as powerful and 
intriguing.

It was almost a relief for both of them when Ranma finished and 
refastened Lisa&#39;s top. Lisa sat up and began to apply the sunscreen to 
her front side. Ranma noticed that, like hers, Lisa&#39;s nipples were rock 
hard and the solid color of her top did little to hide this. Both women 
were flushed and breathing a little raggedly as they completed the 
application of the sunscreen, and neither spoke of what they were 
feeling.

&quot;I...um...need something to drink,&quot; Lisa said shakily. &quot;You watch the 
stuff and I&#39;ll go get us a couple drinks.&quot; Ranma nodded mutely and 
watched her taller friend as she moved off to the bar.

Ranma resisted the urge to slap herself as she realized she was watching 
the way Lisa&#39;s derri&egrave;re moved as she walked. Flopping down on her tummy, 
she dug out one of the manuals she had brought and proceeded to read, 
hoping the dry boring techno-babble would take her mind off of her 
inappropriate feelings for her friend. She didn&#39;t understand why she had 
suddenly allowed herself to be so captivated by the beautiful brunette. 
She didn&#39;t even realize that she was so distracted that she had 
forgotten to be self conscious about her attire, or lack there of.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Ranma looked up from the same page she had read for the 
seventh time and still not registered a word of to see Lisa standing 
there holding out a plastic cup with some sort of frozen drink in it.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Ranma asked, taking a sniff. It smelled fruity and very 
much alcoholic.

&quot;It&#39;s a frozen Rumrunner,&quot; Lisa grinned. &quot;Be careful, it&#39;s almost all 
booze. It&#39;s good though.&quot;

Ranma took a tentative sip through the straw and grimaced a little. 
&quot;It&#39;s strong.&quot;

&quot;It is at first, but it gets better once the ice melts a little,&quot; Lisa 
explained.

&quot;It is good though,&quot; Ranma admitted.

Lisa lay down on her tummy and laid her head on her arms watching Ranma. 
&quot;So do you think they got the message?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry?&quot; Ranma asked.

&quot;The guys,&quot; she clarified with a small jerk of her head toward the men 
that were just now starting to come out of the pool.

&quot;What message?&quot; Ranma asked confused.

&quot;That we&#39;re off the market,&quot; Lisa explained. &quot;After that little show we 
put on it should be pretty clear that we&#39;re together.&quot; Ranma blinked 
once then twice.

&quot;We&#39;re together?&quot; Ranma asked growing more confused by the minute. Lisa 
blushed.

&quot;Well, yeah, we are,&quot; the brunette grinned. &quot;Probably not how they&#39;re 
thinking, though.&quot; &#39;Yet,&#39; Lisa added mentally.

Ranma felt hope die a brutal death. &quot;Oh, I see,&quot; she said. &quot;So that&#39;s 
what that massage thing was all about? Declaring we are off limits by 
leading them to believe we are a couple?&quot;

&quot;Well, a small part was,&quot; Lisa admitted. &quot;But it was mostly because I 
wanted to and I enjoyed it.&quot; She fluttered her eyelashes at Ranma and 
asked in a smoky voice, &quot;Didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re teasing me, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Ranma asked with a giggle.

&quot;Just a little,&quot; Lisa grinned and winked, surprised at herself with how 
aggressive she was being.

&quot;It&#39;s not very nice, you know,&quot; Ranma commented, turning serious.

&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; Lisa said suddenly concerned she had offended her friend.

&quot;Cause you know I like girls,&quot; Ranma explained. &quot;And who wouldn&#39;t be 
attracted to a woman as beautiful as you. Knowing the situation I&#39;m in, 
it&#39;s kinda mean to tease me. I mean I know you like guys so it&#39;s kinda 
like flaunting something in my face that I don&#39;t have a chance at.&quot;

Lisa just gave her a mysterious smile. &#39;You have no idea,&#39; Lisa thought. 
Still, she did feel more than a little guilty. It was cruel of her, she 
supposed, to tease Ranma like that when she wasn&#146;t prepared to follow 
through. &#39;Yet,&#39; she again added mentally.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lisa said after a couple minutes of silence.

&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; Ranma smiled warmly at her. &quot;It was nice to feel attractive 
to someone like you, even if it was just an illusion.&quot;

Lisa bit her lip in thought. After a few moments of inner conflict, she 
spoke, &quot;It wasn&#39;t as much of an illusion as you seem to think. I 
was...not unaffected by touching you. I&#39;m not ready to be in a romantic 
relationship with anyone just now, so maybe it was a little unfair of me 
to tease you. That said, it&#39;s only fair that you know that I do find you 
attractive. Unsurprisingly, in your male form, but I&#39;m very surprised to 
find that your female form intrigues me nearly as much. I&#39;ve never felt 
an attraction to another girl before, but after what we did a bit ago, I 
can&#39;t deny the desire I felt when touching you.&quot;

Ranma watched her for a moment. &quot;This is awkward, isn&#39;t it?&quot; the redhead 
asked finally.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be,&quot; Lisa sighed. &quot;Ranma, you&#39;re my best friend and 
I love you. I feel more comfortable around you than anyone before or 
since Karl, but I still have some unresolved feelings for him and it 
wouldn&#39;t be fair of me to be involved with anyone until I work though 
that. I thought it was only fair for you to know, since I teased you, 
that yes, I do find you very attractive and if some other fortunate 
woman hasn&#39;t managed to claim you by the time I&#39;m ready, you would be at 
the top of my list of people I could see myself with. I don&#39;t want to 
raise your expectations, or make you wait for me, I just want you to 
know that you aren&#39;t as undesirable as you seem to think you are. We&#39;re 
still best friends, no matter what, fair enough?&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Ranma agreed. &quot;And thanks, Lisa. That means a lot to me.&quot;

&quot;Just so you know,&quot; Lisa added with a mischievous grin, &quot;I don&#39;t intend 
to stop teasing you. I had too much fun doing it.&quot; Ranma laughed 
lightly.

&quot;Just be prepared to get as good as you give,&quot; Ranma smirked.

&quot;Oh? Is that a promise?&quot; Lisa asked in a sensuous tone. Ranma shot her a 
smoky look and winked.

&quot;You know it is,&quot; the redhead replied in a matching tone.

Ranma found herself having more fun that she had had in quite some time. 
She and Lisa relaxed in the sun, swam, first in the pool then in the 
ocean, drove each other to distraction with reapplications of sunscreen 
after each dip, and flirted shamelessly with each other. The fact was; 
Ranma couldn&#39;t remember a time when she had more fun or felt so free to 
be herself around another human being.

The pair alternated their drinks with water to prevent dehydration and 
so as not to get anything more than lightly buzzed. Lisa watched 
jealously as Ranma inhaled several cheese burgers prepared on the grill 
at the tiki bar for lunch while she limited herself to one grilled 
chicken sandwhich.

&quot;You&#39;re despicable, you know that Ranma?&quot; Lisa said with narrowed eyes.

&quot;Hummm?&quot; Ranma said, looking up from tearing into her fourth cheese 
burger and quirking an eyebrow in question.

&quot;You act like you haven&#39;t eaten in days,&quot; Lisa griped. &quot;And I&#39;ve seen 
starving wolves eat slower. How can you eat all that and keep that 
figure?&quot; Ranma swallowed.

&quot;Martial arts,&quot; Ranma answered. &quot;I NEED to eat this much because I burn 
so much energy when I train. If I didn&#39;t, I&#39;d look anorexic and I 
couldn&#39;t train so hard because I&#39;d run out of energy. Besides, your 
figure is just perfect, better than mine even, and you don&#39;t have to 
work at it as hard as some girls do.&quot;

&quot;Oh stop it, you,&quot; Lisa protested. &quot;You know your figure is better than 
mine. Your hips are nicer and your breasts are bigger.&quot;

&quot;My breasts might be bigger but I&#39;m disgustingly muscular for a girl,&quot; 
Ranma disagreed.

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Lisa snorted. &quot;You talk like you&#39;re all puffed up like 
some sort of body builder chick. Sure you&#39;ve got a little more tone than 
average but it just makes you more stunning.&quot;

&quot;Nope, it makes me look hard and blocky, while you look sleek and 
smooth,&quot; Ranma argued.

&quot;Oh yeah, well, let&#39;s just ask an expert,&quot; Lisa challenged. She turned 
to the bartender. &quot;Hey, Murphy, which of us had the better figure?&quot; Both 
women stood up and stepped back from the bar, each striking a pose 
worthy of a super model.

Whump! The bartender&#39;s nose geysered blood and he hit the floor 
unconscious.

&quot;I think we broke him,&quot; Ranma observed casually.

&quot;Looks that way,&quot; Lisa said, looking around and seeing several other men 
in the area laying in spreading pools of nasal blood while those that 
remained conscious held their hands over their nose. Even several of the 
women had their hands over their nose, the ones that weren&#39;t glaring 
jealously at her and Ranma anyway. &quot;I think maybe we shouldn&#39;t do that 
again.&quot;

&quot;Too dangerous,&quot; Ranma agreed.
