<h1>Neon Genesis Evangelion Meets Robotech (part 17 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../crossover/evatech-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Breetai looked out from his command bridge at the
great ship that floated off in the distance, his
expression grim as he looked at the most recent aerial
battlefield. The last attack against the SDF-1 had
been a viscous one, with a mysterious energy barrier
system being deployed to protect the great vessel and
later to destroy the attacking force

&quot;How much damage did the explosion do their population
centers?&quot; he asked his crew grimly, the silver helm
that covered part of his face gleaming, the crystal
eyepatch shining. He struck an imposing figure, even
among the warriors of his people.

&quot;Complete devastation,&quot; was the simple answer, &quot;the
shock wave entirely destroyed the region for miles
around. We never considered these Micronians could be
so ruthless, especially against just a few cruisers
and fighter wings.&quot;

Breetai nodded grimly. Commander Khyron had pressed
home his attack against Zor&#39;s ship ruthlessly,
attempting to break through the ship&#39;s defenses
without considering the immense power they faced.
Instead much of his attack force had been utterly
destroyed, and the Micronians had demonstrated yet
another dangerous ability.

&quot;Send the report to Lord Dolza on what happened,&quot;
Breetai ordered, &quot;and maintain a safe distance between
us and Zor&#39;s ship. We must consider this new ability
and what it may mean to the war.&quot; As his men raced to
obey he added, &quot;Monitor their internal transmissions,
we need to acquire any additional data we can.&quot;

&quot;We continue to have difficulty with their language,&quot;
another officer added reluctantly, &quot;ad some of our
people have found the images... disturbing.&quot;

&quot;We are Zentradi warriors,&quot; Breetai answered firmly,
&quot;we will manage.&quot;

Meanwhile, in a private meeting room in the SDF-1
Captain Misato Katsuragi looked tired, rubbing at her
eyes from her seat at the head of the table. Beside
her Maya Ibuki, Ritsuko Akagi and Gendo Ikari sat,
looking at their leader worriedly.

&quot;How much did the barrier overload cost us?&quot; Misato
asked as the black haired woman looked at each of her
officers.

Ritsuko pushed blonde hair back, her uniform now
uncharacteristically wrinkled. &quot;The sector governor
has withdrawn his permission to offload our
civilians,&quot; she said grimly, &quot;and their casualty
reports are still coming in.&quot;

&quot;God.&quot; Misato sighed before looking over at Maya.

The brown haired younger lady looked like she had been
crying, Maya&#39;s eyes red rimmed and a bit bloodshot.
&quot;We were relatively lucky, I suppose,&quot; Maya said
seriously, &quot;we only lost a few pilots when the barrier
went up.&quot;

&quot;The overload was completely unexpected,&quot; Gendo said
without prompting, the black haired scientist grave,
&quot;it was designed to safely dissipate the attacks, but
somehow it absorbed all the incoming energy until
going critical.&quot;

&quot;I think we forget that this is still alien technology
we&#39;re working with,&quot; Ritsuko looked bleak, &quot;with
unpredictable abilities.&quot;

&quot;And to think we raised the barrier to try to protect
the people around us,&quot; Misato said bitterly, &quot;the
world government won&#39;t forgive this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll order the cancellation of the Miss Macross
pageant,&quot; Maya said quietly, &quot;it&#39;s meant to start in a
few days, after all...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Misato said firmly after a moment&#39;s careful
thought, &quot;actually I think we should let them go ahead
with it.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ritsuko looked at her in surprise.

&quot;The people of the city could use a morale boost right
now,&quot; Misato said simply, &quot;not to mention the crew.&quot;

Maya looked a bit nervous as she asked them, &quot;Are you
still interested in having a member of the bridge crew
competing?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ritsuko nodded before adding, &quot;and it&#39;ll
probably be you.&quot;

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Maya squeaked.

Later that day in a larger compartment of the SDF-1
the ship&#39;s chaplain finished up his service, closing
the bible as many of the pilots rose to quietly talk
together. The fliers who had been caught up in the
barrier explosion were being honored all together, a
line of photos and names up near the front of the room
wreathed in black ribbon.

&quot;Commander Akagi and Maya don&#39;t look too good,&quot; Asuka
noted, the orange haired pilot standing with her two
wingmen.

&quot;I think Maya is the type to take this sort of thing
very personally,&quot; Shinji answered her quietly before
revealing, &quot;and I heard that Ritsuko has been running
all over the ship trying to find out what exactly went
wrong.&quot;

&quot;I just hope that Hikari doesn&#39;t run into Ritsuko,&quot;
Rei said to them softly, &quot;she&#39;s upset enough to do
something rash.&quot;

Asuka winced, her eyes seeking out Hikari Horaki in
the crowd. The young pilot stood just a little apart
from the others, her brown haired tied back in a
ponytail, her uniform bearing the same black armband
that all of them were wearing. Unlike most of them she
had lost a wingman, and her grief nearly radiated off
of her.

&quot;Does anyone know why Toji couldn&#39;t get clear?&quot; Shinji
asked quietly.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell Hikari but he was hot-dogging again,&quot;
Asuka revealed, &quot;he was fighting a group of battlepods
and disregarded the evacuation order.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s Aida taking it?&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;He&#39;s more depressed that Hikari, in some ways,&quot;
Shinji looked over at the blonde young man sitting
near Hikari, &quot;they were friends since they were kids.&quot;

&quot;I hate to admit that I&#39;m happy we were off destroying
that cruiser,&quot; Asuka said what all three of them were
thinking, &quot;or we might have been at ground zero, too.&quot;
She nervously ran a hand through her hair, &quot;We&#39;d
better go see if we can help.&quot;

The three made their way to Hikari&#39;s side, the young
woman seemingly lost in her own world. There was a
awkward moment of silence then Rei surprised them by
speaking up. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I didn&#39;t
know Toji that well, but I thought he was a good man.&quot;

&quot;He was an idiot,&quot; Hikari answered softly.

&quot;What?&quot; Asuka blinked in surprise.

Hikari wiped at her eyes weakly, &quot;He took forever to
ask me out, you know. Took him weeks and he nearly
fainted once he managed it.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t realize you two were...&quot; Shinji blinked.

A grim smile twisted Hikari&#39;s lips, &quot;We were careful,
at least as much as we could.&quot; She reached out to
touch the photo of the young man, her hand shaking
slightly, &quot;Now he&#39;s gone and none of that matters
anymore.&quot;

Asuka reached out to squeeze Hikari&#39;s shoulder in a
silent offering of support, &quot;Was there anything you
think he&#39;d want done?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m inviting the pilots out to get good and drunk in
his honor,&quot; Hikari answered with a wry smile, &quot;I think
he&#39;d have wanted it that way.&quot;

Rei noticed a figure making her way through the crown
and nudged Asuka as she softly warned, &quot;Trouble,
incoming.&quot;

Ritsuko reached them before any of the pilots could do
anything, standing in front of the visibly pale
Hikari. &quot;I... regret your loss, Horaki-san,&quot; she said
seriously.

Hikari met her eyes, tears glistening at the corners
of her eyes as she softly growled, &quot;Stuff your
regrets, commander.&quot;

&#39;Oh hell,&#39; Asuka thought weakly.

&quot;Why did this happen, damn it?&quot; Hikari demanded, &quot;How
the hell did ten of our pilots get killed by our own
barrier system?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ritsuko answered honestly, &quot;but I
intend to do everything in my power to find out, and
to make sure it never happens again.&quot;

Rei smoothly kept Hikari from striking the Commander,
grabbing the other woman&#39;s had. &quot;You might want to
go,&quot; she looked at Ritsuko then over to Hikari, &quot;that
would not be a good idea.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ritsuko quietly left.</pre>
