Introduction

January 3425 AD
Three Years After the Events of Mai Otome

Izumi was ducked behind a stairway within the frozen city, a robe 
materialized around her exhausted body. She had been running for hours, 
and flying for an hour more. Her body felt as if it was ready to give 
out then and there. The only thing keeping her moving was the basic 
instinct of self-preservation. One was never to remain stationary in a 
hostile territory, and she knew that at least three of them were 
tracking her. They were out there amongst the ruins, somewhere beyond 
her range of vision. Everything was the same dead silence that always 
held the remains of the ancient city captive. Even on a desperate 
mission to call in reinforcements, they would not leave the Otome alone.

Her support, Naomi, was the only other Otome in the region that could 
operate the vehicle they had prepared in secret. The two were, 
essentially, the only hope their people had of reaching aid. In the 
distance, she heard rumbling. Things were heating up. Those fanatics 
were probably taking the offensive against the rest of the city&#39;s Guard. 
They had to hurry. Too many of their friends had died for as long as 
they could remember. This was their first and perhaps only chance to 
change that.

Izumi moved out from her cover and ran forward, hopping over two dead 
bodies (one Otome, one civilian), and progressing towards the waiting 
aircraft. At the same time, Naomi began to sprint, taking a different 
path to the same location. Not five seconds after they began to bolt, 
three gunshots slammed into the walls behind them. They ducked low and 
continued on, not hindered in the least.

&quot;Emulator is fully charged. Activate Diadem devices in three, two, 
one...&quot;

They heard separate beeps behind them, and, knowing the worst was yet to 
come, the Otome girls ran as fast as their legs would carry them. No 
longer were they simply running to their destination, they were running 
from the enemy behind. The craft, engines already warmed up by the 
support team who had either evacuated from the hostile region or been 
exterminated, neared . They headed straight for the boarding ramp, but 
skidded to a halt when a forth enemy stood up from the top of the 
vehicle, activating her Diadem device.

She glared down at them. Her muscles tightened. The birthmark on her arm 
began to glow brilliantly. A small saber materialized in her hands. 
Izumi and Naomi leapt out of the way as she dove down, blade extended 
and ready to strike. The enemy, covered in a dark coat, lunged forward 
and swiped at Izumi, who blocked her attack with her own staff. The 
enemy countered by grabbing hold of her arm in an iron grip, and Izumi 
yelped in disgust and horror. How dare they touch her? Vile, disgusting 
women.

Naomi came to her aid by giving the enemy a swift knee to the gut, 
stunning her long enough for the two to board the ship. They slammed on 
the button to close the ramp repeatedly as the enemy recovered and her 
teammates closed in, one firing her weapons at them. All bullets missed, 
slamming into the metal of the aircraft. At last, as one of their hands 
threatened to grab hold of one of them, the ramp closed, sealing them 
off from their foe.

Izumi ran up to the cockpit, and Naomi sat down with her. Together, 
pressing a variety of buttons and switches and pulling back on the 
controls, the vessel rose off the ground and took to the skies, leaving 
the fanatic enemy behind. Onward they went, up into the clouds. Bursts 
of fire leapt up from the ground, attempting to swat the vessel down. 
They twisted and rolled out of harm&#39;s way, breaking through the 
atmosphere and into the starry void beyond. Blue shifted to black.

&quot;We&#39;re away,&quot; Naomi said after switching on her GEM&#39;s communication 
function. &quot;Activate it.&quot;

Above them was nothing much stars and shattered metal fragments left 
behind from roughly five centuries ago. But, at the heart of all that 
space junk, something sprang to life as their allies on the ground 
flipped a key switch. A burst of blue light formed in the center of a 
spherical structure, the only one to truly remain intact after all that 
time. Its companion structures lay dead and gutted.

Through that blinding blue light was their only hope. Their sisters, who 
had been taken away in order to protect the colonies, had not been heard 
from since their departure centuries ago. They knew, however, they just 
knew, that somewhere out there, their sisters were waiting for them and 
had simply lost contact after a landing gone wrong. It was something 
they had to put faith in. With the single gate recently rebuild, they 
would go to them. They would ask for aid against their mutual enemy. And 
then, they would be victorious.

The ship passed through the swirling blue mass that was the Lalande 
Gate. The universe went white and silent. Then, ten seconds later, they 
were back in the depths of space. Below them was the dark side of a blue 
world, lights on the surface guiding them in, and offering proof of 
civilization. They were still there. Surely, their sisters were still 
protecting that world.

The two Otome smiled, so very glad that their mission was not going to 
be in vain. Then, alarms sounded. The enemy, in a last ditch effort to 
exterminate them before completing the reunion.

Juliet Nao Zhang was on a routine (read: boring as all hell) scouting 
mission with Sara Gallagher and Maya Blythe, two of her teammates from 
the Five Columns unit. They had been out scouting the desert regions for 
perhaps four hours. At least it was not under the blazing sun. The 
desert at night was a much more tolerable place. Never the less, all 
that effort for a supposed report about minor hostile activity shouldn&#39;t 
have warranted the Columns being sent out, in her honest opinion. Surely 
there was some other lackey who could have been doing it.

The three were in formation flight, going slow over the terrain, 
scanning the ground for any signs of movement. Nothing but desert 
serpents and rodents. Oh, how threatening those sand rats were. She 
sighed for the umpteenth time that night. Whoever had issued the order 
for their deployment was going to pay somehow. It was probably Kruger. A 
fitting assumption, as she was the Column who gave the most orders but 
did the least to help. Nao clicked her tongue in irritation.

&quot;Bank ten degrees to port on my mark,&quot; Sara declared, flying at the 
front of their wedge formation, ever the leader. She began a countdown 
so that the other two could turn along with her. But, when she had 
gotten to the number four, she suddenly stopped.

Nao looked up from the ground, which somehow seemed more luminous all of 
a sudden, to direct her gaze at Sara, who was staring up at the sky. 
Furrowing her brows in confusion, Nao followed her stare up to the 
stars, where the source of the new light displayed itself. Two large 
meteors (or something) streaking through the sky, one just overhead.

The three came to an immediate halt, and the one that had passed above 
them slammed into the ground a few miles back. Not fast enough to 
warrant a crater or explosion. That was odd. The other one disappeared 
off to the east, closer to the mountains. Sara paused for several 
moments, shocked and locked in mental debate over what to do.

&quot;This is Column Number One,&quot; she reported into her GEM. &quot;A meteor just 
impacted the ground a few miles south of our position. Permission to 
investigate?&quot;

No sense in letting the incident two years ago replicate itself if she 
could help it. The reply from Irina, the new dispatcher, was hasty. She 
obviously thought the same thing. &quot;Go ahead and remember to keep in 
contact. Get back to me as soon as you can.&quot;

&quot;Understood.&quot; Sara switched off the line and looked to the other two. 
She waved them forward. &quot;Well, let&#39;s go. Spread out, just in case its 
something hostile.&quot;

Maya took off after her, and Nao followed suit. Well, it was better than 
flying circles over the sand, at least. When they did arrive, however, 
they were in for the surprise of a lifetime.

Izumi gently opened her eyes, and saw the floor of the cockpit. Her head 
was on fire with pain from the impact. A throbbing, crashing pulse 
invaded her mind. She gently put a hand to her forehead and groaned, 
hearing Naomi stir next to her. Then, she slowly began to realize that 
the crashing pulse was someone slamming on the side of the ship. She 
rolled over, too groggy and disoriented to stand up. Was it the enemy? 
They had made it to the colony, hadn&#39;t they?

The slamming on the side of the ship resulted in one of the bolted doors 
being peeled back by a woman with inhuman strength supplied by a 
brilliant robe not too different from their own. So that was a Z-Type, 
was it? Izumi merely stared in awe as three women peered into the vessel 
to check for survivors.

&quot;My god.&quot; One said in shock.

&quot;Hey, are you okay?&quot; A second inquired. &quot;Zhang, get Yoko on the line. We 
might need a medical evac for this.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re shitting me if you think they&#39;re from Earth. I don&#39;t care what 
the markings outside said,&quot; the redhead grumbled as she turned and 
walked away, activating her own GEM.

Izumi held up her hand towards one of them. They were indeed Otome. They 
had found their much needed ally after lifetimes of searching for what 
had happened to those who had left them behind in the aftermath of the 
uprising on Earth. The tide of their long and bitter war could finally 
turn around. They were, Izumi thought, saved.
