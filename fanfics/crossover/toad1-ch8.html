<h2>Black Rose and Thorns</h2>
<p>Dawn broke over Tokyo  like a cresting wave, illuminating the darkness in a rush.  Small eddies of light swirled into dark  alleys and over the tops of buildings as the sun rose, waking the city to  life.  At a small temple in Juuban ward,  the light spilled over the form of a sleeping Rei, caught in confusing dreams of  fire and golden eyes.  She woke with a  start, wiping the sleep from her eyes and pondering what it might mean.<p>
  Across the city, in another temple, a goddess looked  out at a lonely Shan Pu practicing her forms, a sad smile on her face for how  long it was taking her older sister to grant the poor girl’s wish.  Said sister was currently groaning with a  hangover after a night of finding out that Ke Lun could apparently drink an  infinite amount of sake.<p>
  At a vacant restaurant in Nerima, a hand turned a key  in a lock and opened the door.  Ukyou  looked around the interior and smiled.   Give her a month, and Uc-chan’s would re-open for business, and Ranma  would meet his just rewards. <p>
  Several blocks away, Ke Lun stood atop a phone pole  watching as Soun and Genma dragged a groggy voodoo priest out of the house and  into a taxi, then bounced along behind them.<p>
  In the kitchen of the dojo, a still pale Ranma sat  unmoving at the kitchen table, a puddle of congealed cocoa pooling around a  hand still clutching the fragments of a cup.<p>
  In the hall outside the kitchen, Zhu Shu sighed before  continuing to the dojo, and stripped off her robe to begin her morning kata.  It had been a mistake to mention Shan Pu.<p>
  Time ticked inexorably forward…<p>
  When Kasumi entered the kitchen for breakfast, she  uttered her trademarked “Oh, my!” then waved a hand in front of Ranma’s blank  stare.  Slow as granite, the red-heads  eyes rose to meet hers.  “Are you okay,  Ranma?”<p>
  Ranma shuddered, then seemed to unfreeze.  “Just reminded of something I’d rather not  think about.  I’ll… be okay.”  He took a deep breath and seemed to mentally  take hold of himself.  Finally, he  noticed the shattered cup.  “Sorry…”<p>
  Kasumi decided it was not the time to pry, and just  smiled.  “It’s okay, accidents happen.”<p>
  In the bathroom, Akane was brushing her hair as Nabiki  entered and did a double take.  “Hey,  Akane.  You cut your hair!”<p>
  Akane looked at her in the mirror and nodded.  “Last night.”<p>
  “Humm…  And what  brought this on?”  An amused tone was  evident in the inquiry.<p>
  Akane shrugged, making her braid chime.  “Just felt like a change.”  Akane wasn’t about to tell Nabiki the real  reason, knowing her sister would blackmail her in order to keep that knowledge  from Ranma.<p>
  “Um hmm…”  Her  tone made it plain she knew there was more, but that she’d dig it up  later.  “So what’s with the braid?”<p>
  “Zhu Shu thought it would look nice and I agreed.  She taught me how to do them.”<p>
  “Akane put in Zhu Shu hair too.”  The Chinese girl called from the tub, where  she had gone after her kata.<p>
  Nabiki stuck her head in. “Ah, but why black and red?”<p>
  Zhu held up her red and black twined braid and pointed  to the black strands “From Akane-chan.” then the red “From Ranma-chan.”<p>
  Nabiki looked at the red end of Akane’s braid.  “Nice work.”<p>
  “Thank you.”  Zhu  Shu bowed from the tub.  <p>
  “Breakfast!”   Kasumi called from the dining room.<p>
  Fifteen minutes later, they were all seated around the  table and wondering why Soun and Genma weren’t there.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Several hours later and many miles away from Nerima,  Soun, Genma, and the voodoo priest, Sandal, traipsed up the side of a hill near  Mount Fuji towards a long deserted cave, sealed by a large boulder around which  magical wards had been tied.  As they  came to the clearing around the cave and stopped, Sandal was looking wide eyed  at the boulder.<p>
  “Here.  Seal?”  Genma asked in very bad English.<p>
  “Hoo, Mon! You got no idea what you askin’ Mon!  Plenty big spirit locked in here.  Almost free.   Gonna take some puttin down and a massive seal to lock it in.  What you bury, Mon?  A big fuckin’ Demon?!”<p>
  “Master Happosai.”   Soun said nervously.  “Seal?”<p>
  Sandal nodded.  “Hey  Mon, can do, but it’s gonna take a while and I’m gonna need a lot of things to  do it proper.”<p>
  “We get.”  Genma  said, a determined look on his face.<p>
  They turned back toward the small village they’d come  up from and headed away.<p>
  As they vanished into the forest, Ke Lun dropped from  the tree she’d hidden in.  She walked  over to look at the boulder and shook her head.<p>
  “Amateurs.”  It  was a wonder it had held so long already.   Another year at most and the old devil would be on the loose again.  She cocked her ears at a faint sound, almost  on the verge of audibility.<p>
  “<em>Ppaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnnnnnnnttttttttttttttiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeessss</em>.”<p>
  She sat down on the boulder that sealed in her  ex-fiancé and contemplated what the three who had gone down the hill were  planning.  If they succeeded, then that  young goddess was correct in thinking it was a service to the Amazons.  Happosai was a very old matter of tribal  vengeance, even more so than her own personal score as a jilted bride.<p>
  But she had to smile at the irony.  Betrothing Shan Pu to the son of the old  letch’s student and allying the Tendos and the Saotomes to the Amazons for the  service of ridding them of Happosai on a more or less permanent basis was a  rather fitting vengeance for having been left to explain to her mother that her  groom had departed with the family heirlooms and the Amazon treasures, but  without her…  perhaps not as ironic as  the one she had contemplated for over a century, but suitable nonetheless.<p>
  As she leapt away cackling, a faint sound could be  heard, so low it might have been a trick of the wind.<p>
  “<em>Mmmmmmyyyyyyyy  pppppppprrrrrrrreeeeeeetttttttttttttttttiiiiiieeeeeessssss…</em>”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Time passed as it was wont to do and a passing week  found Ranma walking the Ginza looking for a snack and wondering at the  fickleness of fate and Akane Tendo.<p>
  He was still trying to figure out how the girl could  be so sweet and cuddly one minute and so violent the next.  Ever since that fight with Ryouga, she’d been  more confusing than ever.  She would  tease him, and he’d swear the five or six times he’d run into her topless or  naked hadn’t been complete accidents, but she’d been easier than ever to  annoy.  Only this afternoon Akane had  walked in on him in the bath and then had thrown him bodily from the room when  he’d asked “What happened to your hair?” in a surprised tone.<p>
  How was he supposed to know Akane would get angry over  such a simple question?  He’d just been  surprised when Akane had walked in minus the tangle of black curls she’d used  to have, that was all!  He sighed.  Maybe he just should have kept his mouth  shut.  He’d never understood why girls  shaved all their hair anyway.  The  thought of a razor down there made him cringe<p>
  Still, he had to admit Akane was looking really nice  lately.  The sessions she spent helping  Zhu Shu train her friends were starting to tone her already athletic body along  Zhu Shu’s curvy lines.  She was beginning  develop the sword dancer’s rounder figure, and when she wasn’t being angry or  tomboyish, she could be pretty cute.<p>
  Maybe Zhu Shu was teaching Akane a few of the things  that Ranma had learned by watching her.   He’d used several of Zhu Shu’s cuteness tricks to snag a few freebies as  he’d wandered the Ginza and he could attest that cuteness had it’s  advantages.  Now if Akane would only use  it more often!<p>
  He sighed. At least he wasn’t having to fight Ryouga  constantly. He was only annoying occasionally, even if he was always underfoot.  He wouldn’t stop making moon eyes at Kasumi, and she thought he was cute as a  piglet and charmingly chivalrous as a boy. Ranma couldn’t tell if she genuinely  liked the Hibiki boy or if she was just flattered at the attention and flowers,  and chocolate, and flowers, and teas, and flowers and by the way, had he  mentioned flowers? Where Ryouga had managed to find some of the wild bouquets  Ranma would rather not contemplate. He’d nearly lost a finger to that one tiger  lily with a real tiger’s head in it’s blossom, however small. At least Kasumi  had liked it; Ranma just had to walk wide of it in the garden.<p>
  He jumped up onto a fence next to a vacant lot he used  as a short cut to the Ginza, preparing to make him way home in hopes Akane was  out of the tub and that he would be able to finish his bath, but stopped at the  weird scene before him.<p>
  A very pretty female in an expensive uniform from a  private girl’s school stood surrounded by three people dressed in non-descript  gray outfits and swathed in bandages, and holding gymnastics clubs. The girl  they surrounded had jet black hair pulled into a ponytail on the side, and held  herself as if she was completely confident of her safety.<p>
  “Pardon me, but you are from Furinkan High School, are  you not?” the girl in black asked, catching Ranma’s complete attention. “Please,  no need to rush on my account.” she continued. “If I’m not mistaken, we’ll be  having our match in one week.” She smiled condescendingly.<p>
  “No more talk!” one of the swathed figures yelled. “We’ve  got you at last!”<p>
  Ranma squatted on the fence, nibbling absently on a  fried dumpling, and wondered what was up with all the bandages.<p>
  “We’re finishing you off here and now!” the last  figure screamed “Prepare to die!” They rushed the girl in black together.<p>
  Still supremely confident, the girl dropped her bag. “Forgive  me, please, if I’ve failed…” a long ribbon appeared, stretched between her  hands, “…to convey my message!!” Like a lightning fast snake the ribbon lashed  out to knock the onrushing attackers off their feet.<p>
  Ranma was impressed.<p>
  The ribbon whirled around the girl in black like a  living thing. “If I may restate it…” a sharp crack echoed as it connected with  one of the figures. “…perhaps this …or this …or this will be clearer!” Each  statement was punctuated by another lash to the prostrate and helpless forms.<p>
  Enough was enough. As the ribbon struck again, Ranma  moved.<p>
  There was a loud snap. The girl in black looked down  the taut length of her ribbon to Ranma’s hand in surprise, then raised them to  meet Ranma’s.<p>
  “Don’t cha think that’s enough?” Ranma asked casually.  “I mean, You’ve already won right?”<p>
  Half-lidded eyes took in Ranma’s casual stance, but  the girl held the ribbon taut for a long second before she replied.<p>
  “You caught that ribbon as if it were nothing.” She  shifted her stance slightly.” If you’ll forgive me, you seem no ordinary girl.”  She tugged slightly on the ribbon, but Ranma’s hand didn’t budge.<p>
  “Uh ... Yeah.” Ranma was privately amused. “I guess  you could say that!”<p>
  The other girl nodded once. “Good!” Her foot hooked  under one of the abandoned clubs. “Because I prefer not to treat girls…” She  blurred as she released the ribbon and kicked the club into her hand, attacking  even as she spoke, “…with ordinary courtesy!!”<p>
  Ranma dodged the face shot almost contemptuously and  intercepted her leading foot. The girl flew forward, but caught herself on her  hands and did a split handstand to land on her feet as Ranma pivoted to face  her.<p>
  They stared at each other a second, waiting to see  what the other planned to do, then the girl in black made a depreciating ‘Heh’  and spoke. “Well, you are… very good!”   She straightened. “Remember… I am called the Black Rose of Saint Hebereke’s  School for Girls.” A rose appeared in her hand, it’s petals as black as her  dress. “Kodachi the Black Rose.” A sly smile crossed her face as she tossed  Ranma the rose. “Please don’t forget it!” With a maniacal laugh, she bounded  off in a series of leaps worthy of Zhu Shu as Ranma stared after her.<p>
  Behind him the swathed figures began to sob heavily. “Oh,  how humiliating.”  Ranma turned and bent  down. <p>
  “Hey! What’s with the crying? Remember, you’re men!”<p>
  “That’s what you think!” Bandages were ripped away  revealing three cute faces heavily band-aided. “We’re the Furinkan High  Gymnastics team!”<p>
  Ranma stared in shock. All three girls were from his  homeroom. All of a sudden he was glad he’d not had a chance at the tub, because  none of them recognized him. He stared after them as they limped off, looking  anything but athletic, then followed them to the dojo. This was getting curioser  and curioser.<p>
  Kasumi let them upstairs to see Akane, then handed  Ranma a tea tray to take up after them. He sat down on Akane’s bed as the  leader started. <p>
  “Akane! We’ve been humiliated!”<p>
  Ranma stretched his back as Akane looked at the other  girls. “Everyone on the team injured?!” Akane asked in disbelief.<p>
  “We were ambushed!” the leader continued.<p>
  Ranma raised an eyebrow, but didn’t say a word.<p>
  “Now we’ll have to withdraw from the match!” The girl  laid it on thick, eyes dripping tears of bitterness.<p>
  “Then…” Akane pondered, “You want me… to take your  place?”<p>
  “Please Akane! There’s nothing else we can do!”  Desperation colored their voices. “You see, this next match is Rhythmic  Gymnastic Wrestling!”<p>
  That threw both Ranma and Akane for a loop. “What the  heck is that?!” Ranma asked.<p>
  “This!” A diagram was slapped in front of them showing  two female combatants attacking each other with gymnastic equipment. “The  schools champions fight with the techniques of Rhythmic Gymnastics!”<p>
  Akane stared, then said slowly “I’m still not sure I  get it… But alright. I will avenge you!”<p>
  The gym team girls clutched at her oversized sweater. “Oh!!  Thank you Akane!!”<p>
  Ranma rubbed his temples in disbelief.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Watching Akane staring at the supposed weapons of her  bout several hours and a hot bath later, he knew he’d been right.<p>
  “You shouldn’t have agreed so quick. Do you even know  how to use these things?” He idly twirled a club quickly enough to buzz.<p>
  Akane said a lot more confidently than she felt “You  just watch!”<p>
  A snort from the door drew their attention as Zhu Shu  walked in carrying Ryouga the piglet. She looked curiously around the dojo and  gave Akane an inquisitive look. “What do?”<p>
  “Akane has to fight a rhythmic gymnastics match. She’s  ‘practicing’.” Ranma said wryly.<p>
  “Hey! I can do this!” Akane protested, adding an “I  think” under her breath.<p>
  Zhu Shu sat on her knees next to Ranma and put the  piglet down with an absent pat. Ranma watched and leaned over on one elbow. “Yo,  Ryouga, looks like you’re letting the “cute piglet” routine go to your head.”<p>
  Ryouga bit him.<p>
  Ranma pried the annoyed piglet off his arm and  prepared to punch him as Zhu Shu hissed “Behave or throw both out!”<p>
  Ranma refrained from booting the piglet into orbit. “He  started it!” he huffed.<p>
  Ryouga put on an innocent look. As Zhu Shu petted him,  he gave Ranma a gloating look.<p>
  Akane interrupted before Ranma could hit him. “Now  watch this!” She did a leap, performing a split in mid-air as her clubs twirled  up in beautiful arcs…<p>
  …And landed on the far side of the dojo as she touched  down.<p>
  “Are you supposed to let them drop like that?” Ranma  asked.<p>
  Frustration colored Akane’s cheeks. “Very funny.” She  glared at the traitorous clubs then bent down. “Let’s try the ribbon.”<p>
  A few minutes later, Ranma asked “Are you supposed to  get tangled up?”<p>
  Akane forced a “Shut up!” past the ribbon wrapped  around her throat ... and the rest of her body.<p>
  Zhu Shu and Ryouga looked at each other, then the  Mandarin girl picked up the piglet and carried him outside.<p>
  Akane untangled herself and tried the hoop. She caught  it well enough, but as she tried to slide through it, she snapped it.<p>
  “Are you supposed to break the hoop?” Ranma asked from  the sidelines as Akane yelled “That does it!” and threw away the pieces in  frustration. He couldn’t resist adding “Aren’t you supposed to have just a  little bit of grace?”<p>
  Outside in the garden, Zhu Shu stood by the entrance  to the house as Ryouga emerged. “You wanted to talk to me?”<p>
  “Ryouga know what Akane do?” the small Chinese girl  asked.<p>
  “Rhythmic Gymnastics? Yeah. I know the style, but I  doubt Akane will let me teach her. She just gives me dirty looks.”<p>
  “Show Zhu Shu. Then she try get Akane to let teach.”  She hopped up on a convenient bench. “Zhu Shu know ribbon, but not other  weapon.”<p>
  Ryouga nodded. “Okay. If you know ribbon, the other  stuff isn’t too hard. The secret to Rhythmic Gymnastics is that you can’t  attack barehanded…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, Zhu Shu and Ryouga entered the dojo  to hear Akane crying “I’m a klutz! I’m a klutz! I’m a klutz!”<p>
  “Hey! What can I do about it?” Ranma said unhelpfully.<p>
  “Ranma, you always know exactly the wrong thing to  say.” Ryouga commented.<p>
  “Oh yeah? Well what should I say, Pig Brain? I don’t  know this Rhythmic Gymnastics stuff!” He crossed his arms. “You think you can  do better, be my guest!”<p>
  Ryouga’s eyes narrowed and he reached down to pick up  the ribbon Akane had dropped. It blurred into a spiral that slammed Ranma into  the wall.<p>
  Ranma glared at Ryouga murderously, his cut clothes  hanging off him.  “Why you!”<p>
  Ryouga bowed to Akane. “Zhu Shu asked me to show her  what’s involved with Rhythmic Gymnastics, since I am familiar with the  techniques. If you’ll let me, I’ll show you how to use the basic weapons, the  ball, the hoop, the clubs, and rope. Zhu Shu will teach you how to use the  ribbons. I know you don’t like me much but I can help.”<p>
  Akane’s eyes narrowed.   “What’s in it for you.”<p>
  Ranma smacked him on the back of the head.  “He just wants to score points with Kasumi  and Zhu Shu!”<p>
  Ryouga growled.   “Why you-“ His hands came up in claws as he launched himself at Ranma.<p>
  “Will you two stop acting like children!!”  Akane yelled.<p>
  Zhu Shu looked at the two boys bouncing around the  dojo with half lidded eyes.  “Zhu Shu  thought Senshi bad. Begin wonder maybe mistake.”  She sighed as she took out her swords and  began to spin.<p>
  Loud cracks echoed across the room as a swirling  tornado of cloth forced Ranma and Ryouga to opposite sides of the dojo. At the  storms center, Zhu Shu danced, her swords moving so quickly she appeared to  have six arms. The rhythmic cracks of her snapping ribbons matched the  intricate steps of the spinning dance and within their spirals, she seemed some  how obscured and hard to see. With a last snarling whirl, the dance came to the  utter stillness of a completed form and as the ribbons slowly floated down, Zhu  Shu fixed Ranma and Ryouga with a hard glare. “We here teach Akane, yes no?” <p>
  “Jeez, Zhu Shu, where did you learn that?” Ranma asked  amazed. He looked down to the tattered scraps of cloth that had once been his  shirt, then over at Ryouga, who was in a similar state.<p>
  Akane grinned. “That was wonderful! That was an  absolutely gorgeous dance!”<p>
  Zhu Shu smiled. “Um… thank you. Zhu Shu learn ‘Dance  of Veils’ from Indian Dancer.” <p>
  “You gotta teach me that!” Ranma said. “That’s a hell  of a technique.”<p>
  Zhu Shu raised an eyebrow, recalling Nabiki’s similar  remark. “Um… Not think Ranma really want Zhu Shu do that.”<p>
  Akane looked at her curiously. “Why? It’s a lovely  looking dance.”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave Akane a sidelong glance and a sultry  smile. “Zhu Shu not do full dance… Zhu Shu still have clothes on.”<p>
  Akane stared at her for a moment as that penetrated,  then her mouth rounded into an O as she blushed. “Oh… I… see…” then she looked  sidelong at the wide eyed stare Ranma was giving Zhu Shu. “Maybe you should  teach <em>me</em> that dance.”<p>
  Ryouga’s nose gushed blood as he ran out of the room.  Ranma just looked at the two girls and shook his head. “Girls…” he muttered disgustedly.<p>
  Zhu Shu and Akane broke out in wild giggles. </p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Outside in the darkness, a cloaked figure listened to  the sounds from inside the dojo and thought “So, they’ve sought help. These  Furinkan high gymnasts are bad losers.”<p>
  The cloak dropped away to reveal Kodachi in a black  leotard, holding a large mallet. “Akane Tendo…” she said around the rose in her  mouth, “…I, Kodachi, The Black Rose, will cripple you!”<p>
  She vanished into the darkness above the walls.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu sat on the dojo floor shaking her head as  Ryouga coiled his ribbon and told Akane “Enough special drilling for today.”<p>
  Akane knelt on the floor catching her breath. “Thank  you… so much.”<p>
  “You handled the ribbon very well. You’re making very  quick progress.”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed. She was glad someone thought so. She’d  tried having the returned Ryouga teach Akane the basics of ribbon so she could  observe and see where Akane needed the most help.  Unfortunately, it appeared it was everywhere.<p>
  Akane looked at Ryouga hopefully. “You really think  so, Ryouga?”<p>
  Ranma looked at her with half lidded eyes. “You don’t  really buy that stuff do you?”<p>
  So thoroughly tangled that she couldn’t move her arms,  Akane rounded on him. “You shut up!”<p>
  Ryouga looked at Zhu Shu and scratched his head puzzledly.<p>
  Zhu Shu gave him a “what can you do?” kind of shrug,  and fell back spread eagled on the floor as she sighed. “We do tomorrow. Same  time.”<p>
  Ranma untangled Akane and watched as she stormed off,  then turned to Zhu Shu. “You make it look easy. Why don’t you fight the match?”<p>
  Zhu Shu gave him the evil eye. “First. Zhu Shu not one  asked. Two. Is Chinese exchange student. Three. Is sempai. Match between lower  classes.” She looked back to the ceiling and sighed. “Or Zhu Shu would. How  Akane have such good combat skill and be so clumsy? Usagi be more coordinated,  Zhu Shu thinks.” She put her hands palm up across her eyes. “Must think. Ranma  shoo now.”<p>
  He nodded and wandered into the garden to plop down on  a stone birdhouse next to the Koi pond. It was almost bed time and he could  hear Kasumi in the kitchen prepping for breakfast. Ryouga walked out to stand  near the pond and looked towards the kitchen with a smile.<p>
  “It’s embarrassing to watch.” Ranma said to him. “And  you! Have you no shame? Flattering her like that!”<p>
  “You should be ashamed of yourself, Ranma - for your  jealousy!” He stepped into the pond.<p>
  “Who’s jealous?” He watched as Ryouga crawled out of  the pond. “What? You off to charm Kasumi into giving you a few treats again? At  least I don’t have to resort to being cute to be near Akane! What do I have to  jealous of?”<p>
  Ryouga bit him. Hard.<p>
  “Youch!” Ranma howled “That’s it, Pig! Bacon time!” He  dived for the piglet who bounced away…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane opened the door to her room with a creak. Now  that she’d taken her bath, she was really feeling the effects of the exercise  she’d been through. She flopped down on her bed and muttered “I’m exhausted.”  She rolled over and her eyes focused on a long tassel of black hair. She  followed the tassel up with her eyes to the girl in a black leotard clinging to  her ceiling. Her eyes widened as the girl cried “Prepare yourself, Akane Tendo!”  and dropped towards her with a large mallet.<p>
  Akane forced tired muscles to move as she flipped out  of the bed to land in front of the bookcase in a crouch. As the mallet impacted  the bed, she asked “Who are you?!”<p>
  The girl rolled to the edge of the bed and stood  primly, the mallet balanced easily in one hand. “I’m from St. Hebereke’s School  for Girls! Kodachi, The Black Rose!” She swung the hammer at Akane, who dodged.  “I shall be your opponent next week!” She missed again. “So… Let us both do our  best…” She tried to catch Akane with a downward blow, but missed again as Akane  dodged. “…and fight in all fairness!” the girl finished.<p>
  Now Akane was mad. “You call this…” she cried, “…in  all fairness?!” She launched a kick at Kodachi, but the girl dodged and came up  standing by the door. “It’s you, isn’t it!” Akane realized. “The one who’s been  ambushing the team!” <p>
  “Ambush?!” Kodachi actually sounded surprised. “What a  nasty way to put it.” She gave Akane a sly look. “I simply believe in fighting  in all fairness <em>before</em> the match!”<p>
  “That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever…” Akane  started, but at that moment a small black rocket slammed her door open into  Kodachi’s face. Then she was slammed back into the wall as Ranma slammed it the  rest of the way open with a cry of “Bacon! Pork Chops! Sausage!”<p>
  They bounced around the room like super balls and were  back out the door almost before Akane had a chance to react. She leaned out the  door after them and yelled “Ranma! You better not hurt him till he’s done  teaching me for the match!” The whistle of the wind warned her and she turned  to kick the mallet out of Kodachi’s hands...<p>
  They glared at each other as the mallet crashed to the  floor, then Kodachi pulled out her ribbon. “So. The rumors are true. You are  good aren’t you?” Black rose petals swirled in a blizzard as she spun her  ribbon in a spiral and she vanished from sight. “Until next time!”<p>
  “Rose petals?” Akane asked in puzzlement, but as the  petals cleared, only the fall of a single black rose answered her. Kodachi was  gone.<p>
  She stood before the open window and yelled “Who-“  Then in a quieter tone “who do you think is going to clean up this room?” she  looked around at the mess. “Kodachi, the Black Rose, I’ll repay you for this at  our match!”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Kodachi stood on the roof over Akane’s room and  contemplated her failure. She’d lost, something that hadn’t happened in so long  she’d grown contemptuous of her competitors, but this Akane Tendo could not be  so easily dismissed. She had to crush her before the match, no matter  what!  It was bad enough to have been  bested by her tonight, but to be shown unworthy in front of the entire school  would be unbearable ... No, she could not allow the world to know what a  failure she was in truth…<p>
  She began to run along the roof and away, but had  taken no more than a few steps when a small black blur flashed towards her. She  had only the time to notice that it was a baby pig before a vengeful spirit  rose before her and cried something she couldn’t make out in her surprise. Then  the brass kettle in it’s hand connected with her forehead and stunned her.<p>
  The sound of brass rang in her head as she watched the  moon arc by in slow motion. Seconds moved at a crawl as her world turned upside  down and the ground fell towards her face.<p>
  <em>How fitting,</em> she thought. <em>Slain  by a spirit for my clumsiness. An appropriate end to a life so filled with  failure. A dog’s death… A broken neck. The slow asphyxiation to follow… Mother  would have said it was just what I deserve…</em><p>
  Then her slow approach to the ground ceased as a pair  of strong arms surrounded her and bore her away from her fate. The wind made  her close her eyes as she was lifted and felt the world go right side up again,  then the voice of a god asked her “You okay?”<p>
  She opened her eyes to gaze upon her savior, and she  knew then, that somehow, karma had relented and released her from her terrible  destiny. He was beautiful. An Apollo. A Hercules. He was even more handsome  than her hated, gods favored brother, Tatewaki!<p>
  She blushed and looked away. To think that such a  beautiful man had cared enough to rescue a clumsy, ugly girl like her! She  threw her arms around his strong shoulders and cried, “I was so frightened!”<p>
  His hesitancy made her blush again.  Only a true gentleman could act so. <em>Oh, the gray dreary life of a girls school!</em> she thought. <em>I had given up hope of  finding a man to love! To think that such a wonderful encounter was awaiting  me!</em>  He couldn’t be like the others  who had taken their pleasure of her then left!   He couldn’t be!  He was the  One!  Her romantic god upon his white  steed come to bear her away to bliss!!!<p>
  “Please sir…” she prayed. “May I ask your name?”  She burned with the desire to hear his divine  voice again.<p>
  Ranma was rather nervous at the intense look the black  clad gymnast was giving him. “R-r-Ranma Saotome” he stuttered.<p>
  Kodachi smiled. He was shy! How divine! She had to  encourage him! She handed him a bouquet of roses to show her desire of him. “For  you, My Ranma!”<p>
  He took it with a surprised look, and as he took a  sniff, the aerosol can released.<p>
  Kodachi was oblivious to her own maniacal laughter as  she looked down to where Ranma had collapsed twitching in response to her “encouragement”.  “A bit of paralysis gas in the bouquet!” she explained to allow Ranma to  appreciate her aid in overcoming his shyness.<p>
  “What?!” Ranma said in shock, his body refusing to  obey his will. “Are you crazy?!”<p>
  Still so shy! Afraid to admit his love!  Kodachi marveled. she threw herself on his  manly form. “Now, My Ranma. Be brave.” She cradled his face in her hands and  the wild look in his eyes inflamed her desires to their peak. Her heart  hammered in her chest and she could barely breathe. “Take these lips of mine!”  She panted.<p>
  Then a foot caught her in the side and sent her  flying.<p>
  “Right over my bedroom yet!” Akane growled.<p>
  <em>The villainess!</em> Kodachi thought. <em>To  interrupt the consummation of true love!</em> <p>
  “Such tragic timing!” she lamented as she landed. So  close, and yet the vile girl stood over her god like a vengeful demon. <em>Oh the tragedy!</em> <p>
  But such was her fate. As always, to come so close and  to fail. Her mother was right...<p>
  No. she would prevail! The gods could not be so cruel  as to give her Ranma and take him away! This was a test! The vile wench was her  challenge to overcome.<p>
  But now was not the time. She turned to look at her  beautiful god. “My Ranma, let us meet again!” She turned and vanished into the  night.<p>
  Akane watched her go in a furious rage. “Feh.  Ridiculous!” She snarled. The bitch had not only tried to ambush her, she’d  tried to seduce her fiancée. And him! She turned to look at the still unmoving  Ranma. How could he have fallen for that innocent act! She tugged her braid in  a fury. Served him right! Letting her cling to him like that! And allowing her  to almost kiss him!  When he hadn’t even  given her a <em>real</em> kiss yet!<p>
  Almost, she shoved him off the roof and let him dash  his brains out on the rocks around the Koi pond. Almost…<p>
  She shrugged out of her house coat and dropped it over  him. “Sorry I got in the way of true love!” she turned to stomp off. “Nighty  night!”<p>
  As she disappeared, a light sound came to Ranma’s ears  and his eyes turned to see Zhu Shu looking after Akane as she crouched next to  him. “Humm… Zhu Shu think Akane jealous…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Downstairs again in her bed, Akane punched her pillow.  Kodachi, the Black Rose!!! It was unfair! She had a body to kill for, a  gracefulness Akane would give anything to posses, and she just <em>had</em> to be rich! Why did she have to have  so many advantages over a clumsy girl like herself? How could she compete? A  girl like that could have any boy she wanted! Why Ranma!?!  Even with the exercises Zhu Shu had been teaching  her, how was she ever going to develop a body like that?  Why wouldn’t he choose the sexy gymnast over  her!  He thought she was sexless!  And after she’d gone and shaved in hopes of  making him notice, in hopes that he’d find her more attractive!  Kodachi comes along and off he goes, falling  for her hook, line and sinker!<p>
  One thing was certain. Come hell or high water, there  was no way she was going to lose to her. Not in the ring… or out of it!!!<p>
  But dammit! Why’d she have to make a play for Ranma!?!<p>
  Sleep was a long time coming…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>As silence descended over the dojo once more, a black  figure detached itself from the shadows it had concealed itself in as Kodachi  moved past, and watched its quarry help Ranma down into the house.  For just a second, red eyes gleamed in the  darkness of it’s face, then vanished as it once more slipped into the dark.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Morning in Nerima after wonderful dreams.  Leaves fell slowly through the air as birds  sang joyfully, and the demoness Akane Tendo was right below her…  Her practice sword overhead primed for a  killing blow, she descended like a vengeful angel.  “Akane Tendo, prepare yourself!!” she cried  as she delivered her death stroke.<p>
  Akane caught the blade in one hand and stopped it  cold. Kodachi fumed at how easily the beast had foiled her attack, but she had  only been a target of opportunity. She glanced around for her real quarry as  Akane growled “You again! Ambushing me first thing in the morning!”<p>
  Kodachi was taken aback. The offensive cow! How dare  she! “Ambushing?!” She cried, outraged. “I was doing no such thing!” She  informed the girl of her purpose of her visit in a haughty voice. “I have  merely come to visit with Ranma!”<p>
  Berserk rage kindled in Akane’s eyes. “Oh?! Then why  don’t you go right to him!!!” With the strength of an oni, she threw Kodachi  through the air towards her god, who apparently hadn’t noticed her and was  running away. “Oh! Wait! Please!” She called after him as she landed, but he  was so preoccupied with his thoughts he didn’t hear. She ran after him as he  approached her thrice bedamned brother, then leaped over Kuno’s bokken swing to  plant his foot firmly into that oh-so-blessed-by-the-gods handsome face.<p>
  The sight warmed her heart, but she didn’t allow it to  distract her from the burning passion in her soul. As Kuno grabbed Ranma’s  shirt and they talked, she latched onto Ranma’s divine back with a contented  sigh. “Oh Ran-ma Sa-ma!”<p>
  A frozen moment passed as Ranma politely bowed his  head to Kuno to await his decision. Oh, to think that Ranma loved her so much  to approach her brother so quickly!<p>
  Kuno pondered them for a moment, then gave them both a  hearty clap. “Yes!”<p>
  Ever modest Ranma asked “Yes, what?”<p>
  A victory fan appeared in Kuno’s hand as he clasped  his soon to be brother-in-law on the back. “Yes, you have my permission to go  steady!”<p>
  In a haze of bliss, Kodachi looked into her god’s  eyes. “I am so happy!”<p>
  Then cruel fate once more made a mockery of her  happiness. “Wait a minute!” Ranma cried, his words venomous daggers to her  heart. “You can’t tell me what to do!” Oh the pain! The shame! “I have no  intention of going st-“ her sobs broke off his hateful words as once again she  could see how she had failed to live up to her dreams. Tears poured like rivers  from the pain and shame and anger at her failure… <p>
  “So!!” she cried, stepping forwards as he back  stepped. “You hate me!!”<p>
  His words stopped her. “No. No. It’s just…” he laughed  nervously. “I have a fiancée!” He placed his hands around the demoness Akane’s  shoulders. “Her. Really!”<p>
  The splintered pieces of her heart came to a crashing  stop. “F-f-f-f-f-fiancée? You?” She stared at the ugly cow with her short hair  and that ridiculous braid.<p>
  “More or less.” Akane admitted.<p>
  Understanding came. “So” she said. This demoness had  trapped Ranma into this unholy pact, and he was too noble to save himself. “How  interesting.” Her ribbon lashed out, but Akane dodged it. She had too much  space here, Kodachi realized, but in the ring, she had the advantage. A  solution to the dilemma presented itself. She smiled.<p>
  “What do you say then? Shall we wager for Ranma in the  upcoming match?” She would free her Ranma by defeating the wretched girl,  humiliating her, and defending her school all at the same time. Perfect!<p>
  “Wha-“ Ranma started to say, but he was overrun by  Akane.<p>
  “What did you say?!” she balled her fists. “Are you  insane?!”<p>
  Kuno’s hand on her shoulder stopped her. “I think it’s  a fine idea, Akane. If you wish to leave Ranma… you need only lose.”<p>
  Kodachi laughed at her brothers pitiful attempt to  help her. “She needn’t worry about that! She’ll be losing in any case!” She  wouldn’t fail this time. She <em>wouldn’t</em>!!!  She turned to her poor trapped god. How happy she would make him! “Ranma! When  this match is over…” she bit a rose stem as she blushed at the wonderful things  they would do together. “…You shall be mine!” The shock on his face at the  realization that freedom was so close made her heart nearly burst . She closed  her eyes and released the rose petal blizzard. “Farewell.” Her joy at having  outsmarted that fiendish Akane lent wings to her feet.<p>
  Staring in shock at Kodachi’s departure, Akane and  Ranma heard Kuno sigh. “Really, that girl is such a deviant.” They watched  Kodachi vanish in the distance. “But even so, Ranma Saotome, take care of my  little sister.” He gave Ranma a comradely pat on the back.<p>
  Ranma looked at Kuno in disbelief. “Huh?” He did a  double take. “Wait a second, What did you just say?”<p>
  Kuno looked at him coolly. “I said, ‘take care of my  little sister’.” He turned. “Even though I am her brother, I have to admire her  for being so wicked… so nasty… so spiteful… and so thoroughly twisted!” He  presented the bouquet of roses he was holding to Akane. “Please Akane, try not  to let her injure you.” He turned to walk away. “When Kodachi wants a man, she  doesn’t let go. She’ll surely try something evil in the match.”<p>
  He disappeared into the building as Ranma and Akane  stared.<p>
  “Ku- Kuno’s sister?” Ranma finally spoke.<p>
  Just as stunned, Akane answered. “Now that I think  about it… they’re identical!”<p>
  A low cough made them turn to see Nabiki and Zhu Shu  on the back of the smilodon. Zhu Shu looked around at the carpet of rose petals  and sighed. “Zhu Shu think Akane need go advanced training.”<p>
  Akane looked into her friend’s eyes and nodded…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>School dragged on forever with Akane fuming over  Kodachi and fighting with Ranma. Zhu Shu saw them at various times during the  day, noting the massive streak of jealousy in Akane’s aura and sighing as she  contemplated her course of action. She had to teach Akane the art of the  ribbon, and no matter how she ransacked her knowledge of techniques and herbs,  she came back to only one solution, and a potentially dangerous one at that.  The only way she could do it in time was by using the same method she had  learned it by, which raised the question of whether Akane could allow herself  to relinquish that much control of herself.<p>
  Days end finally arrived and Zhu Shu decided to give  Ranma and Akane some time alone. She meandered over the rooftops in no  particular hurry as she approached the dojo, but mid-way there, her senses  tingled and she barely had time to draw her swords and block a lightning swift  attack from a gray blur.<p>
  She blocked several more attacks with her ribbons,  shifting fully into the ribbon form as she descended to a telephone pole, more  puzzled than alarmed. The attacks were just probes, testing her defenses more  than serious attempts to harm, though her attacker was shielded against her.  She balanced on the pole as her ribbons danced, blocking the attempts of the  gray blur to penetrate her defenses. Finally, the gray streak landed and  resolved itself into the Warleader of the Amazons, Ke Lun.<p>
  Zhu Shu finished the form and put away her swords  before clasping her hands before her to bow. “Greetings Great-grandmother. I  trust my defenses have met with your approval?”<p>
  “They have, Child of the Dragon. A most interesting  use for the Dance of Veils.  Why did you  shift to that for defense?”<p>
  “Your attacks were probes.  I had no need for offense, and the Dance of  Veils is the most defensive form I know.” <p>
  “Are you schooled in the full technique?”<p>
  “I have learned the full Dance of Shiva,  Great-grandmother.” Zhu Shu admitted.<p>
  Ke Lun appraised her carefully. “I will keep that in  mind the next time I have you spar with Shan Pu. She has grown used to your  usual forms. And perhaps I should have you teach her the Dance of Veils for her  husband.  How did you come to learn  it?  It is not a part of the Song School.”<p>
  Zhu Shu blushed as her eyes darted around. Ke Lun  noted them and shook her head.<p>
  “Shan Pu is not with me, Little Mouse. I decided to  come speak with you alone.  But please, I  am curious.  The Dance of Shiva is an  Indian martial art.”<p>
  Zhu Shu turned a deep red.  “I was educated in it by an Indian Dancer,  Great Grandmother.”<p>
  Ke Lun noted the blush and raised an eyebrow.  “Among other things, I suspect.” she noted  the start and the deepening crimson and laughed.  “I am Amazon, Child, and no stranger to the  love of women for each other, or how they pleasure one another.” <p>
  Zhu Shu looked shamed face.  “I did learn much from our time together,  Great Grandmother.  She came to me in a  time of great depression on my husband quest, and helped renew my spirit.  I-I know my grandfather and aunt would not  have approved, yet I could not resist her, or the comfort she offered.”<p>
  “There is no crime in that, Little Mouse.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked down.   “I did not wish her to leave, Great Grandmother, though we both knew we  would be soon parted.  She gave the Dance  to me as a gift of remembrance for what could not be.”<p>
  “Yet you did part.   And continued on your quest.  She  aided you in a time of need.  Do not be  ashamed of that Child.  Honor her for the  caring she showed you.”<p>
  Zhu Shu’s eyes meet Ke Lun’s and she smiled at the  approval she saw there.  Then her smile  froze at Ke Lun’s next words.<p>
  “A most interesting occupation you have had of late.”  the old woman said dryly. “I have watched you for the last few days. A very  interesting way you have of fulfilling your quest to secure Ranma for Shan Pu  as her Groom.”<p>
  Zhu Shu stood very still and said nothing.  Her eyes stayed locked on the elder.<p>
  “Were I Shan Pu, I might question your methods.  Suspect you had betrayed your quest.”<p>
  There was nothing she could say in her defense. Ke Lun  had not asked a question. She hoped Ke Lun did not believe she was guilty of  betrayal. She had no chance if the elder decided to kill her, and by Amazon  law, she was an adopted sister to Shan Pu, and an Amazon herself. Her death for  betrayal would not be quick. She could gain no clue of Ke Lun’s thoughts  though. The Warleader controlled her aura too well.<p>
  Ke Lun watched her eyes for a long moment before  nodding. “Good. You believe you do right. I needed to see if that was the case.  I am not Shan Pu, great granddaughter, and once I have explained your reasons,  she will understand what your friendship means. I had underestimated your  wisdom, my child. And your devotion to your friends. I see what you are  attempting and I approve. Had you the time, you might have succeeded.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked at Ke Lun wide eyed in alarm. “Shan  Pu-!” she started, visions of her purple-haired adopted sister fighting Akane  to the death flashing through her mind.<p>
  Ke Lun held up her hand. “Calm yourself child. Shan Pu  is far from here. You need have no fear she will fight this Akane Tendo. There  now is no need. Her father and Ranma’s have performed a service to the Amazons  of such magnitude that an alliance can be forged. Shan Pu shall be engaged to  Ranma as part of this alliance, and so Amazon law can be met.  But for this to take place, the Tendos must  not object to the alliance, and the Saotomes not refuse our offer.  To do such an insult can result only in blood  feud. You know them granddaughter. Will this happen?”<p>
  Zhu Shu closed her eyes and thought.  The Tendos depended on the marriage to Ranma  to ensure that the School of Anything Goes continued.  Soun might object at first, but so long as  the marriage to Akane wasn’t jeopardized, he most likely would eventually  accept, particularly if the alternatives were explained and the benefits shown  him.  Saotome merely needed to have the  threats told to him. He was never adverse to saving his own skin.  She looked back to Ke Lun.  “They may object at first, but I believe if  it were made clear to them why they must not refuse, their objections can be  overcome.”<p>
  Ke Lun nodded.  “I  had assumed so based on their actions. They show that their own skins mean much  to them.  Can you explain this to them?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “I fear I am too much another  daughter to them.”<p>
  “I see.  Well  there is one whom we could trust in Nerima who could deliver the message, and  advise on how best to deliver it.  I will  contact him.”  She looked again at Zhu  Shu through half lidded eyes.  “And how  will Ranma and this Akane take the addition of Shan Pu as a second fiancée?”<p>
  Zhu Shu sighed.   “It will take much work, Great-grandmother, but I believe they will  accept her in the end.  Ranma has much  honor in him, as well as pride.  He is  learning to express his feelings gradually, and he is at heart a good man.  If Shan Pu is patient and loving, demanding  no changes of him, she will win him.  He  resists demands, but can be subtlety guided.   It is Akane I am worried about.   Like Ranma, she is strong willed and full of pride, and just as stubborn.  She, too, has to be won, else she will see  Shan Pu as a rival.  In this regard she  is herself at heart an Amazon.”<p>
  “But you believe it can be made to come to pass?”<p>
  “Yes.” Zhu Shu averted her eyes lest Ke Lun see too  much in them. “Akane has already learned much about herself, and I am helping  her build up her self esteem. She has suffered much since the death of her  mother and has hidden away the side of her she considered weak, believing she  had to be strong. It is not easy for her to draw it out again. I do think she  is learning that to be feminine is not always to be weak. Yet, she is still  confused in matters of the heart.  She is  in love with Ranma, though she resists admitting it, and she is only just realizing  she likes Ranma as a female as well as a man.”<p>
  Ke Lun looked at her for a long moment, her aura  unreadable, and  Zhu Shu feared she had  said too much.  “So Akane is aware of  your own preferences.”<p>
  Zhu Shu couldn’t deny it.  “Yes.”<p>
  Ke Lun turned to look out over the city, the silence  building.  Zhu Shu waited, hoping Ke Lun  had not guessed what she had not said.<p>
  Finally, the elder spoke. “And what of your own quest,  child?”<p>
  Zhu Shu had dreaded that question. “It… it is not the  time to continue it, Great-grandmother. I am not yet done with my quest to aid  Shan Pu.”<p>
  Ke Lun tried to catch her eyes, but Zhu Shu avoided  them. Ke Lun nodded. “There is that you have not said, Little Mouse.  I know you wish the love of a woman solely,  but that cannot be.  Reluctant you may  be, but your quest must be fulfilled. You are the last Dragon, my child. There  must be an heir. On this Clan and Tribe both agree.”<p>
  “I am aware of my familial duties, Great-grandmother.”  Zhu Shu answered sadly.<p>
  Ke Lun laid her hand on Zhu Shu’s shoulder. “I am  sorry you have no brother, Little Mouse. I would free you from this burden if  it could be done.” She lifted Zhu Shu’s chin to look her in the eyes. “It does  not have to be unpleasant, granddaughter. Surely there is one with whom you can  be content?”<p>
  Tears fell from the corners of Zhu Shu’s eyes as she  whispered. “One with whom I can be content?   There is no-one, Great-grandmother.   The one whom I had believed I might accept is betrothed already and soon  will be again. Yet even were he to ask I would deny him. He is my friend… I  cannot curse him with my hand… I cannot condemn him to share my fate…” She  closed her eyes to fight the tears. “I could not do that to anyone I love…”<p>
  “Will you deny yourself love child? There can never be  any good to come from that. And what of your tests? Did you set them only to  insure your failure?”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook her head. “No… I… will fulfill my duties  to one who can pass the tests… but I cannot love them back… I am cursed.”<p>
  “No child. You are no more cursed to be what you are  than any woman.  Surely you can not hate  men so much as that. There is no shame in love Zhu Shu, so long as it is true.”<p>
  “And yet my duty bars me from the love I desire.  I can feel nothing for men, Great  Grandmother.  For all my training to  please them, I feel no passion, no desire when I am with them.  Not even Ranma.”<p>
  “Duty is as heavy as a mountain, Little Mouse, yet we  must fulfill it nonetheless. To do otherwise robs us of honor.” She gently  brushed Zhu Shu’s braid back over her shoulder. “Do not despair, Little  Mouse.  I know that Shan Pu desires  you.  I gave her my permission to seek  you as a bride.  I know she would in all  ways strive to make you happy.  Were you  to accept her as your sister-wife, you would need to fulfill your duty with  Ranma only to bear an heir.  The Loremaster  can ensure that you would conceive.  You  need have no other intercourse with him as a man.”<p>
  Zhu Shu shook.  “It  would not matter, Great Grandmother.  I  could not hide my feelings from him.  I  would not hurt him that way.  I love him  as a friend too much.”<p>
  Ke Lun relented.   “I will think on this. Mayhap there will yet be a way to fulfill duty  and still bring you happiness… I would do much to see you happy, Child of the  Dragon, for the happiness you have brought to others. Do not give up hope yet…”<p>
  Zhu Shu bowed, her closed eyes fighting a losing  battle .  “Thank you, Great-grandmother.  I… will try.” she whispered.<p>
  Ke Lun kissed her on the forehead and with a faint  sound of wind was gone. Zhu Shu stood on the pole for a long while as the tears  fell like rain.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane was waiting at the door to the dojo when Zhu Shu  finally arrived, and upon seeing the Chinese girl, gave her a double take. “Zhu-chan?  What’s wrong? You’ve been crying.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “Zhu Shu be okay. Just talk with  Great-grandmother. She is worried for Zhu Shu is all.” Zhu Shu wiped her eyes. “Could  not stop tear is all. Zhu Shu give up on happiness. It seem no one else do. All  think Zhu Shu should be happy. Cannot be and fulfill duties.”<p>
  Akane hugged her at the sound of sadness in her voice.  “We care for you, Zhu-chan. We hate the trap you’re in and want to find some  way for you out of it.” She hugged her tighter. “And we’re going to!” she said  fiercely.<p>
  “Yeah!” came a five voice chorus from the doorway,  where the Juuban girls were once again eavesdropping avidly, eyes wide.<p>
  Zhu Shu essayed a sad smile at her students. “Almost,  Zhu Shu believe.”<p>
  “Believe, Zhu Shu.” Akane said. “Somehow, we’ll find  the right girl for you.”<p>
  “She likes girls?” Usagi said right before Rei bopped  her on the head and knocked her over. “Owwww! What was that for?”<p>
  “Dummy!” Rei was furious. “How blind can you be!”<p>
  “Well, I didn’t know. No-one told me.” Usagi whined as  she rubbed her head.<p>
  “Um ... Rei? I didn’t know either.” Ami said.<p>
  “I suspected, but I didn’t <em>know</em>.” Minako added.<p>
  “And how did <em>you</em> know?” Makoto asked.<p>
  Rei blushed furiously.<p>
  Zhu Shu laughed weakly. “It not matter. Zhu Shu  appreciate try cheer her up. Thank you. But is time for lesson, yes no?” She  straightened her dress and dried her eyes. “Lessons best thing for Zhu Shu now.  Help clear mind.” reasserting her iron control, she ushered the girls into the  dojo.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Zhu Shu noted Akane watching her closely through  practice, and was glad to see her trying to learn the exercises so ardently,  but unfortunately, she overreached and pulled her shoulder muscle. Zhu Shu had  her sit to the side working the muscle to keep it from stiffening until she had  finished with the Juuban girls and they were on their way home. As she worked  on Akane’s shoulder in the dojo, Akane surprised her with a question out of the  blue.<p>
  “Zhu-chan? What is it like to make love to another  girl?”  Akane asked in a quiet tone, her  eyes searching for Zhu Shu’s<p>
  Zhu Shu’s hands froze. “W-what?”<p>
  Akane turned to see her better, the towel draped over  her slipping to the floor, revealing her unclothed form. “What is it like to  make love to another girl?” she was blushing a deep red, but her eyes were  pleading.<p>
  Zhu Shu took a deep breath, then reached over to pick  up the towel and put it back over Akane’s body, her hands shaking. “That evil  thing do Zhu Shu. Ask question like that and lose towel.” She sat down across  the room and looked at her. “Why ask?”<p>
  Akane sat up, holding the towel to cover herself, much  to Zhu Shu’s relief. “I-I-I was curious… a-a-about w-w-hat it would be like  f-f-for me and R-r-r-Ranma.” Her blush deepened and spread all the way to her  towel. “I-I-I mean, I know what’s done… I-I-I’ve seen magazines. But you’re the  o-only girl I k-k-know who’s done it.”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked at her for a long time before  answering. “Zhu Shu cannot describe. Words not say what Zhu Shu mean. Can  describe actions, can describe feelings, still not come close.”<p>
  “Oh.” Akane’s voice was disappointed<p>
  Zhu Shu looked off into nothing. “Zhu Shu only have  lover twice. Both times different. Both times mean more to Zhu Shu than words  can say.” She looked back to Akane. “In this, Zhu Shu think she luckier than  most.”<p>
  Akane cocked her head. “Why?”<p>
  Zhu Shu sat quietly for a long moment before deciding  to answer “Listen girls from school, ones admit not virgin. Most say first time  not pleasant. Messy. Painful. Man not know what do, hurt girl, not care for her  pleasure. Most only do to keep boyfriend. Were pressured to do. Others feel  only way get boyfriend at all. Only few do because really want to, because feel  is sharing between two kindred souls. Not like that for Zhu Shu.”<p>
  “What was she like?”   Akane asked, her voice hesitant.   Zhu Shu took a deep breath as tears formed at the corners of her eyes.<p>
  “Ying-Ying… Cherry Blossom, was best friend in  village. We love one another for long time before do anything. She so beautiful  Zhu Shu think heart would break when see.   When first kiss, think heart burst out of chest.  Spend hours learning how to pleasure one  another. Both young, yes, and just learning and experimenting, but feelings  there.  Never feel pain when Ying-Ying  tear hymen, but blood on dress betrayed.”   She stopped for a long moment, her throat tight.  “Aunt nearly kill Zhu Shu in anger.  Ying-Ying parents decide move week later…”  Zhu Shu’s voice broke as she sobbed silently, then continued in a whisper. “Nine  month later Zhu Shu learn dead. Fall from cliff…”<p>
  “Oh, Zhu-chan…” Akane whispered.<p>
  Zhu Shu wrapped her arms around herself tightly, still  staring blindly into the past, tears streaming down her cheeks.  “Zhu Shu stop fighting family duties on day  she learn”<p>
  A rustle of cloth hitting the ground was the only  indication of Akane’s motion until she laid an arm across Zhu Shu’s shoulders. “I’m  so sorry. I… didn’t know.”<p>
  Zhu Shu closed her eyes and struggled to seal the pain  back behind the iron wall.  Finally, she  shrugged, her voice steadier. “Is old pain… Zhu Shu learn to live with long  ago.”<p>
  Akane heard the lie in her voice, and she hugged the  smaller girl to her. Zhu Shu sat there a long time, the warmth of Akane’s body  doing little to fight the chill of old angers and regrets. Finally she  continued. “Second time, Zhu Shu older, trained in many ways to please by  aunt.  Aunt make Zhu Shu learn how please  man.  Make learn how attract man’s eyes,  how seduce.  Train for years in art of  pleasing men, learn much,  yet Zhu Shu  find self student to one who know far more. She find Zhu Shu when feel only  thing Zhu Shu good for is make babies.   When Zhu Shu think no-one ever want for anything else.  Zhu Shu had quest for over half year, no find  anyone who met tests, just people want have sex with Zhu Shu.  Sarhia train Zhu Shu in art of dance, but she  also teach much about pleasure, and passion.   She show Zhu Shu she more than just body for men to use.  Give Zhu Shu courage to continue quest.  Zhu Shu learn much from her of the physical.  Will always cherish time as her student.” a faint smile came to her at the  memories of those long days with her teacher in Shiva’s Dance, the beautiful  Indian dancer she’d met in Beijing. “Zhu Shu learn from her that there can be  much pleasure for oneself in pleasing another.   Zhu Shu never forget, even when think quest failure.  Part Sarhia touch never give up hope.” She  gave Akane a look with a little of her normal sparkle returned. “Zhu Shu think  Akane do much worse than Ranma for fiancée. He have unique appreciation of the  pleasure of a woman, like Sarhia. Perhaps have taught enough that he make first  time with Akane wonderful.”<p>
  Akane rose to stand before her and give her a hand up,  then pulled Zhu Shu into an embrace, her bare body pressed against the thin  silk of Zhu Shu’s dress. “Oh, Zhu-chan… I want that first time to be with you…  I want you to teach me…” One hand rose to cup Zhu Shu’s head as she bent to  kiss her.<p>
  Zhu Shu’s hands on her shoulders stopped her. “No.”  She looked into Akane’s eyes as she took a deep breath. “Akane… please… Zhu Shu…”  She swallowed hard and concentrated on her Japanese. “I-I would like nothing better,  but I-I can’t.” She had to look away from the hurt in Akane’s eyes. “Please, if  you  not Ranma’s fiancée… I-I would have  give anything to have heard words from you. But I would not be true friend if  accepted offer. I could not play with heart like that. Ranma deserve better.  Akane deserve better… Sha-…” she caught herself just in time. “Ranma is your  fiancée. Zhu Shu know Akane care about Zhu Shu. Know Akane think she make Zhu  Shu feel better this way. Know Akane think is what she want do… But I cannot  allow… there is no honor…”<p>
  “Honor be damned” Akane whispered, tears in her eyes.<p>
  “No… Akane-chan mean too much to Zhu Shu to hurt like  that.” She held the other girl in her arms, letting her head rest on her  shoulder. “I am sorry Akane-sama.” she whispered.<p>
  “I hate you.” Akane sobbed.<p>
  “Why?” Zhu Shu asked soothingly.<p>
  “Because I don’t want you to be right…” She turned to  look into Zhu Shu’s eyes. “I wanted you to make wild passionate love to me… to…”<p>
  “Show Akane she truly desirable… show her she match up  to Kodachi Kuno.”<p>
  Akane looked away. “Damn you and your dragon eyes.”  She laughed bitterly. “I wanted to be swept away in passion… and you stand  there with your implacable will, unmoved while I crash and break around  you.  Can nothing break you?”<p>
  Zhu Shu took Akane’s hand and moved it downwards to  touch her thighs, then raised it again to let the other girl see the fluid on  her fingers. “Akane come very close… Zhu Shu go take very cold bath now.” On  unsteady legs, she turned to go.<p>
  Behind her, unseen, Akane rubbed her wet fingers  together, then slowly raised them to her lips to taste.</p>

<p>The masked Chinese wizard Mara faced was not the  person she had expected to find as the head of a clan of assassins, yet this  was the person her spell had lead her to, the person she had traced the dead  assassins in Tokyo to.  His age was  impossible to determine behind the mask, but he felt centuries old.  He was not at all what she had expected.<p>
  Then again, neither was the Hexagram she found herself  trapped in. She felt along the invisible walls around her, but they were like  iron.  She tried to dispel them, and her  eyes widened in shock when she failed. The wizard laughed.<p>
  “Your Mistress herself could not break that seal,  demon. Why not desist and tell me why you have invaded my domain.”<p>
  Mara looked at him, and reasserted control of herself.  “I believe we may have a mutual interest.”<p>
  The man steepled his fingers. “Indeed. Scorpion has  many interests, demon. Only a few involve the affairs of your realm or the  Heavens.”<p>
  Mara raised her eyebrow at the casual way the man said  that, then nodded as she sat cross-legged in midair. “This is a mortal affair  in which we may share a common cause.” She smiled evilly. “Shall we suffice it  to say we both wish this mortal harm?”<p>
  “And you cannot eliminate this ‘mortal’ yourself?”<p>
  “I am… restrained in direct action.  A goddess watches directly over this mortal,  and I am not yet ready to challenge her directly.  I wish to make her… suffer first.  She is watching me, but will not be on guard  for the actions of another mortal.”<p>
  The wizard gave her a contemptuous smile, one she  could feel even through the impassive mask.   “Ah… and what grudge do you suspect Scorpion holds against this mortal.”<p>
  Mara bristled at the smile, but controlled the anger  that demanded she slay him and everyone in the mountain fortress. “She has  slain those whom you sent to Japan to capture her.”<p>
  The man’s knuckles whitened against the arms of his  chair, but he gave no other outward sign. “Yes… The Heir.” The ice in his voice  at the end dropped the room temperature several degrees. “In truth, I cannot  say I regret their deaths. They acted against orders. Still, such an offense  cannot go unpunished. And her death or capture would do much to repay the debts  owed to Clan Dragon.”<p>
  Mara smiled back, a cold lifeless thing. “And if I  could arrange that?”<p>
  The wizard smiled just as coldly. “She is a warrior  trained equal to any ten of my best assassins. The men in Japan tried to  capture her only because they sensed she was low on chi, yet she still bested  them easily. I will not waste men uselessly.”<p>
  “Perhaps if she were unable to fight?” <p>
  The wizards eyes glittered behind his mask. “And you  believe you can arrange this?”<p>
  “Perhaps. I must investigate the possibilities, which  I cannot do from this Hexagram…”<p>
  “Agreed.” He muttered a cryptic phrase and the symbol  ceased glowing. “If you can arrange for Song Zhu Shu to be captured, we will be  in your debt, Demon. Clan Scorpion never forgets its debts.” The glitter in his  eye made sure she realized both meanings of that promise. Mara didn’t bother to  laugh at the notion this mortal could harm her, once he had served her  purposes, he’d find out how foolish it was to annoy a demon.<p>
  And the absence of that maddening Chinese girl would  make Urd’s assignment impossible. And once Urd failed, she would be right where  Mara wanted her, on the end of her leash.<p>
  “We shall see what can be arranged, wizard.  If nothing else, perhaps events can be  manipulated to lure her back to China and into a trap.  She is blood bonded to an Amazon, and likely  would feel a duty to aid them if… <em>unfortunate</em> things were to occur?”<p>
  “Indeed.”  He  looked at her over steepled fingers.  “A  promising idea.  I have several  possibilities in mind.  Return to Japan,  demon, and watch over her for the moment.” a mirror appeared in his hand and  floated over to Mara.  “Use this to keep  me updated.  I will set up the trap, and  together, we will spring it to ensnare our Little Mouse.”<p>
  Mara noted the absurd implication that the wizard considered  them equals, but tucked the mirror into a sleeve and gave him a feral grin. She  turned to go, but a last question struck her.   “By the way.  Why does she hide  that dragon tattoo she bears?”<p>
  The man laughed. “It marks her, Demon, for all the  world to see. It marks her as what even she herself does not know. It marks her  as the Heir.”<p>
  “I don’t understand.”<p>
  “No, Demon. Nor do I wish you to. It is a Clan matter.  That is all you need know.” The finality of his statement dissuaded her from  further questions. It didn’t matter anyway, so long as the Chinese girl was out  of the way.<p>
  There was still much to do. She’d drag the answers out  of him later… when she was slowly ripping his soul out of his body…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Shan Pu stood at the door to the mansion and pressed  the funny little button like she’d been told, even though it looked nothing  like a bell. A sound of chimes came from far inside, and she nodded. Now, if  she remembered her older cousin correctly, it could be awhile before he found  the door. Rin Se’s adopted son had always had the worst sense of direction. It  had worried his mother when he had disappeared for days at a time whenever sent  on simple errands, but eventually she’d gotten used to it when nothing they’d  tried had ever worked for long. When she was little, Shan Pu hadn’t minded that  he got lost so easily, he’d had an uncanny knack for showing up at the right  time to help the younger kids out of trouble. She’d been especially grateful at  thirteen when he’d shown up and rescued her from Herb, the neophyte leader of  the Musk. Nor had she forgotten how badly hurt he’d gotten doing so. He’d left  the village to find his real parents following his recovery, and Shan Pu  suspected, to find a way to get revenge on Herb, both for his injuries, and her  curse.<p>
  She sat down on the step, thinking back over her  childhood and the various little misadventures she’d gotten into with him. The  encounters with the twins from the next village over, Pin Ke and Lin Ke and  their plants… the time she’d fought that arrogant Tarou, even the one time she’d  gone for a walk with her cousin and ended up in someplace called El Dorado when  she was six. Her cousin had wandered in and out of her life like he had  wandered across the land.<p>
  Finally, she heard footsteps behind the door and  hopped up to greet him when he opened the door.<p>
  The door opened inwards to reveal a slightly feline  face that broke into a wide grin when he saw her. “Shan Pu! Little Cousin!  What brings you to Japan!” He stretched his arms out  for a hug.<p>
  Shan Pu let herself be engulfed by the much larger  figure.  “I’m on a husband quest.” she  responded as she hugged him back. “I’m getting married!”<p>
  “What?  My  little cousin?  Don’t tell me you caved  in to Mu Si?”<p>
  “Don’t be silly.   I’m getting married to a proper husband for the best of all  reasons.  He defeated me in fair combat!”  She beamed. “Isn’t it wonderful?” she sighed.<p>
  Her cousin took in the starry eyed look and shook his  head.  She had it bad. “Shan Pu.  If he beat you in a fair fight, why are you  questing?  You should have been married  on the spot!”<p>
  “Well… he was a girl at the time and I didn’t know he  was cursed, so I gave him the kiss of death.   Then his traveling companion told us the truth and we came to Japan to find  him.  We had to split up because Tokyo was so big, but now  she’s found him and Great-grandmother and Zhu Shu have worked out a plan to  settle things to overlook the fact that he already has a fiancée.”<p>
  “Whoa!   Whoa!  Whoa!  Zhu Shu?   Song Zhu Shu?”<p>
  “Yes! She’s my Blood-Sister.  She’d been living with my groom preparing  things so that when we arrive, Ranma can’t escape again.  And Great-grandmother has a plan to ensure  his family doesn’t ruin things by objecting.”<p>
  “Ranma… Saotome?”   He sat down and shook his head. “Shan Pu, he’s engaged to Akane Tendo.  How in  all the hells does Ke Lun think  she can convince them to engage him to you as well, short of wholesale  slaughter and kidnapping?  I know that’s  the normal way, but this is Japan.  Ke Lun may be a stickler for traditions, but…”<p>
  “Great-grandmother has her reasons, cousin.  She’s the Warleader, and must uphold the  traditions.”  Shan Pu looked at him  crossly.<p>
  “No matter how out of date they are?”<p>
  “Cousin!” she said in shock.  “You were raised on those traditions!”<p>
  “Humph.  A year  in the JSDF mellowed my opinions on ‘traditions’ Shan Pu.”<p>
  “Do not let great-grandmother hear you say that or she  will re-educate you in them.”<p>
  He shuddered.  “I  don’t intend to tell her.”  He stood  again.  “Anyway, little cousin.  I take it you were sent to fetch me for some  reason?”<p>
  Shan Pu nodded. “Great-grandmother will tell you what  she plans so you may advise her on how best to proceed.”<p>
  “Ke Lun?!   Listen to <em>me</em>?  What a novel idea!”<p>
  “Tao-Ching!” Shan Pu chided.<p>
  “Just kidding, little cousin.  Just kidding.   Lead on…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Honey and cinnamon.<p>
  She couldn’t get the taste of honey and cinnamon out  of her mouth or off her fingers, nor did she really want to despite the guilt  the taste brought.  She’d give anything  to take back those moments and the words she’d said to Zhu Shu.  She had never meant to hurt her friend like  that and she’d undo it if she could… and yet at the same time, she couldn’t  stop thinking about that last moment, when Zhu Shu had taken her hand and  showed her the effect she’d had on her…<p>
  Honey and cinnamon…<p>
  She’d run to her room, unable to bear the feelings of  shame at what she’d done, and the fire between her thighs.  She’d exhausted herself over the last hour  between mind numbing orgasms and bouts of crying.<p>
  How could Zhu Shu not hate her for torturing her like  that?!  She was engaged to Ranma!  Zhu Shu’s best friend!  She should have known better, should have  thought first, should have realized it was going to backfire.  All she had wanted was to make Zhu Shu feel  better, to cheer her up… to caress her and kiss her and…<p>
  She was in the middle of her eighth climax when the  door opened and Kasumi slid into the room. Too shocked to move, she lay there  with one hand cupping her breast and the other between her legs, staring  guiltily.<p>
  Kasumi tilted her head and looked her over. “She said  you’d probably be doing this or crying, but from the state of your pillow and  sheets, I’d say you’ve been doing both.<p>
  Akane sighed and blushed simultaneously as she covered  herself with her sheet. “She must hate me.”<p>
  “She said you’d say that too. She asked me to tell you  that were you not engaged to Ranma… she would have accepted.” Kasumi sat on the  edge of her bed. “She’s not upset with you Akane. She’s flattered. And she said  it boded well for Ranma.”<p>
  “But I- I…”<p>
  “Tried to seduce her and almost succeeded.” Kasumi  smiled.  “In my opinion, it might have  been a good thing if you had…”  She  rolled her eyes.  “Then again… she’d be  the one doing this right now and convinced that she had betrayed you both by  shaming the fiancée of her best friend.”   She sighed.  “I love her to death,  the dear, but she can be ever so stubborn about some things.  Then again, so can you and Ranma.  No practicality at all.”<p>
  Akane stared.   Kasumi noted the shocked look and chuckled.  “What? I’m your big sister, Akane.  You’re supposed to talk about sex and things  like that with me.”  She reached down and  poked at the damp sheet.  “Besides, who  does the laundry?  I’ve been a little  worried by the fact that I don’t have to change your sheets as often as Nabiki’s.”  She smiled.   “It’s nice to see you finally admitting to being a normal girl.”<p>
  Akane blinked repeatedly.<p>
  “But still… we really should talk about things like  contraceptives and sexually transmitted diseases, as well as techniques and…”  She looked at a beet red Akane who appeared  to be trying to crawl into the headboard.   “Oh, do calm down, Akane.  You  were just soaking your sheets thinking about sex with another girl, why are you  getting so flustered by my talking about it?”<p>
  “But- but- you’re my sister!”<p>
  “Exactly my point.”   She sighed and folded her hands in her lap.  “Akane, you never had the chance to learn any  of this from our mother.  She had a talk  with me about all this when I was much younger than you.  Mother was a very practical woman, she had to  be, to balance out Father, and she raised me to be practical too.  I try my best to be like her, and even though  mom might not have handled these things exactly like I am, well, I’ve had to  learn to be more pragmatic about things.   Raising you and Nabiki and taking care of Father demands it.  But I enjoy it too; it makes me happy to have  everything running smoothly because I feel like I’ve accomplished something  important.”<p>
  Akane sat limply against the headboard, too shocked to  do more than nod.<p>
  “And I know you admired Zhu Shu’s pragmatism about  educating Ranma in the finer points of female anatomy.”<p>
  Akane nodded again.<p>
  “So why does my pragmatism about teaching you about  sex embarrass you?”<p>
  “Umm… It’s just an attitude I’d expect from Nabiki, not  you.  Although with her, I’d expect a ton  of laughter and a lot of blackmail.”  She  shrugged.  “It’s just unexpected,  Kasumi.  I mean, yeah, I can see your  logic, but, it’s <em>you!</em>”<p>
  Kasumi laughed, a bright merry chuckle.  “Oh, my. I’m just too straight-laced, am I?”<p>
  Akane nodded furiously.  “You’re just so… so… conservative… and  traditional!”<p>
  There was a bright sparkle in Kasumi’s eye.  “Really?   Well Akane, you might be surprised about that.  Geisha training is very traditional. I may  not know everything Zhu Shu does, but I do read a lot, and I’ve studied it over  the years. Anyway… I’ve decided to give you a few lessons in the ‘traditional’  arts, like the tea ceremony and such, as well as advice about men and sex.   Zhu Shu could give you a far better education  in those arts than I, but when I asked her, she said she’d enjoy it far too  much if you were her student in those matters.”   She laughed again at the return of Akane’s beet red blush. “She also  said to tell you to be glad I’m not her aunt.   I gather her aunt was a very strict teacher.”<p>
  Akane gulped. “Geisha training? Zhu Shu’s a  geisha?  Is that what she meant?”<p>
  “She didn’t call it that, she used a Mandarin word,  but the closest match in Japanese was geisha. She said it was just another way  of serving her emperor.”  She looked  towards Zhu Shu’s room.  “From the slight  bitterness in her voice, I would take it her lessons weren’t very pleasant for  her.  Then again, knowing her preferences…”  She left the rest unsaid.  “Still, I figured that if you might be  getting sexually active, I should do my best to make sure you were safe about  it.  I know what kind of urges teenagers  get, Akane.  I went through it all myself  just a few years ago.  If I hadn’t had to  take care of you all, I’d have made even worse mistakes than I did.  Nabiki has made a couple, and if she hadn’t  been so insistent that she knew what she was getting into…”  She sighed.   “Well, she’s still stubborn and will make up her own mind.  But you, Akane; you’re my little sister, and  I don’t want you to be hurt.  There are a  lot of guys out there who will do nothing but use you - believe me.  I’ve been so worried about all the boy  problems you had at school until Ranma came along.  I was afraid that you might… well, it didn’t  happen and I’m not one for ‘what might ofs’.”   She sighed again. “I’m really starting to get jealous of you these days  Akane.  I think maybe I was far too quick  to pass Ranma off on you just because he was younger than me.  He’s not perfect, but he is a really nice  person at heart. And with Zhu Shu helping him out… He’s still got a long way to  go, but I’m starting to see what he could become.”<p>
  Akane looked at her even more shocked.<p>
  “Oh my, I’ve shocked you even further now have I?”  Kasumi giggled.<p>
  Akane nodded.   Then curled her feet up to wrap her arms around them.  “You’re jealous of me?  Over Ranma?” She smiled. “Who would have  figured.  He’s arrogant, proud, stubborn…”<p>
  “And he cares about you… and you care about him.”  Kasumi finished.<p>
  Akane blushed. “Yeah… He’s a jerk sometimes… but he’s <em>my</em> jerk.”<p>
  “I’m glad to hear that. I hope someday, I’ll find  someone like him.”<p>
  “What about Ryouga? He’s always hanging around you.”<p>
  “He’s a very nice boy too. And very chivalrous. I  haven’t made up my mind about him yet.” Kasumi admitted. “I do like older men  because it usually means they’ve matured enough to think about my feelings as  well as their own…”  She sighed  softly.  “I guess I just don’t know yet  with Ryouga.  But mainly, he is so <em>cute</em> as a little piggy!”<p>
  Akane grinned. “Sounds to me like you do like him.”<p>
  Kasumi blushed delicately. “Maybe a little.  What I really wish is that Doctor Tofu could  overcome his nervousness enough to actually ask me out.  Then I’d rattle HIS bones!”<p>
  “Oh, my.” Akane giggled softly.<p>
  Kasumi batted her foot. “You’re terrible.”<p>
  “ME! You’re the one sitting there telling me you’re  gonna teach me to be a geisha!”<p>
  “Well… it’s better to teach you than to let you learn  from mistakes… And I’m not teaching you to <em>be</em> a geisha, I’m just going to teach you a little about sex, and things to maybe  help your romance with Ranma along…” She looked at her seriously again.  “It’s not something to just gloss over. It  would cause so many problems if you came up pregnant.  And don’t bother to tell me you haven’t even  thought about it.  I’ve heard about your  little ‘accidental’ flashes.”<p>
  Akane blushed again. “Ok… yeah… I’ve thought about it ...  What it would be like with…” She blushed harder.  “Well… with him in either form really.  I guess it’d be kinda pointless to deny I’m  attracted to him as a girl too… considering.”   She looked down to the mute evidence of her fantasies.<p>
  Kasumi noted her gaze and nodded.  “There’s nothing wrong with that, Akane.  You’re in a unique situation.  I’ve had my share of fantasies along those  lines too.”<p>
  Akane looked at her wide eyed.  “You?”<p>
  “This from a sister who suspects I’ve slept with Zhu  Shu… Yes. I’ve fantasized, but on the whole, I guess I like men entirely too  much to really do anything with a woman on my own.  I love Zhu Shu as a friend, and yes… I’ve  kissed her… But we’ve never done anything else.”<p>
  Akane looked at Kasumi’s smile… still the same warm  caring smile she had trusted all her life. And yet… “You know Kasumi, before  Zhu Shu came, I could have sworn I knew you so well… Now…”<p>
  “She has a way of bringing out of people things that  are normally hidden, yes no?”<p>
  Akane laughed at Kasumi’s imitation.  “Yes yes.”   She tilted her head at Kasumi.  “If  she had asked, would you have slept with her?”<p>
  Kasumi smiled.  “That…  is something I don’t know the answer too.   I guess I will just have to wait and see if she ever asks me.  I can’t say that I’d rule out the possibility  I’d say yes.”<p>
  Akane smiled.  “At  least I’m not alone in that.”<p>
  “No.  But I am  curious about something Zhu Shu said… she said you had tried to seduce her  because you were jealous over Ranma?   What happened today to make you so jealous?”<p>
  Akane’s eyes hardened.   “That bitch sister of Kuno’s, Kodachi. It’s bad enough I have to fight  her, it’s bad enough she’s rich and graceful and pretty.  Oh no.   She just has to fall all over Ranma and he lets her! I found them on the  roof last night almost kissing!  Then she  fawns all over him in school today and wants me to wager Ranma on the match!”<p>
  Kasumi nodded.  “Oh,  my. And what did you do?”<p>
  “Well what could I do?   The whole school was watching!”<p>
  Kasumi shook her head.   “Oh, dear. Akane… you really need to learn to control your temper… I  really don’t think that Ranma’s encouraging this Kodachi, is he?”<p>
  “Well, he’s certainly not discouraging her either!”  Akane fumed.<p>
  “Akane.  What do  you want him to do?  Punch her?  From what Zhu Shu told me, he’s done almost  everything short of violence to discourage her.”<p>
  Akane glared at nothing.<p>
  “Akane, is it really even that you’re angry with  Ranma?  Or are you afraid that Kodachi  might be successful?  Are you afraid of  losing Ranma?”<p>
  Akane wouldn’t meet her gaze.<p>
  Kasumi sighed.  “Oh  well, it was worth a try.”  She got up  and straightened her skirt.  “I really  think you should think about it, Akane.   Anyway, I have to go and get dinner on the table before Ranma starts  eating the house.”  She looked over her  shoulder just before slipping out the door.   “I really do love you, Akane.  I’m  just trying to help.”<p>
  Akane hung her head. “I know Kasumi.  I’m sorry…   It’s just so hard to…”<p>
  “I know.  It’ll  come in time…”  She slipped out the door  with barely a whisper.<p>
  Akane stared after her for a long time, asking herself  over and over, what did she really feel?</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>After a rather quiet dinner, Ranma sat on a rock by  the dojo and pondered the strange tensions he’d felt in the room at  dinner.  Zhu Shu had seemed… strange,  almost as if she felt guilty about something, and Akane, when she had finally  come down, had seemed to spend more time looking at him than eating.  It was weird… he wondered what he had done  now.<p>
  A whisper of cloth made him turn to see Kasumi sit  down on the bench next to him.  He  blinked. “Hey, wasup?”<p>
  “Ranma, what happened in school today?”<p>
  “Huh.”  The  question caught him by surprise.  “Uh… nothing  much I guess… When we got to school Kuno’s crazy sister attacked Akane and  tried to glue herself to me.  And Akane  got mad when I tried to tell Kodachi I had a fiancée.  Then Kodachi challenged Akane… that if she  lost the match next week, she had to give me up too… and that idiot Kuno  encouraged her.  I can’t believe she went  along with it.  I dunno… maybe she wants  to get rid of me… I can’t make heads or tails of her. One minute she’s so… um…  well… she can be really nice you know, then bam she’s angry and I’m getting  yelled at.  At least she hasn’t hit me  for a while.  I can’t figure her  out.  And now at dinner, she looked at me  the whole meal and I couldn’t tell if she was mad at me, or what…”<p>
  “How do you feel? About her?”<p>
  “I don’t know… I mean… “ He looked down into the  water. “I- I like her… and I want her to like me… but I always seem to mess  things up… and then she’s mad at me… and half the time I don’t know what I did  wrong…”<p>
  “Have you ever told her that?  I mean, in words, just like that?”<p>
  “I- I…”  His  voice lowered to a whisper.  “I can’t…” <em>What if she laughs at me?</em> his mind said <em>what if she tells me she hates me when she’s  not mad?</em><p>
  &lt;&lt;Why not find out?&gt;&gt; a voice whispered  back… barely loud enough to hear.<p>
  “Because… I- I…”   He took a deep breath. “I-I’m afraid… she… might laugh at me.” <p>
  &lt;&lt;But what if she doesn’t?&gt;&gt;<p>
  Ranma’s breath caught as he tried to think of an  answer to that, then a noise made him raise his eyes to where Akane was  crossing the walkway to the dojo for her lesson in rhythmic gymnastics with Zhu  Shu.  Kasumi looked into his eyes as he  watched her, and nodded.  “You might be  surprised at that…”  She rose and picked  up a cloth wrapped bundle from the bench.   “I actually came to ask you a favor from Zhu Shu.  She asked me if you would guard the dojo  tonight.  Make sure no-one enters.  She said what she would be doing tonight  could be dangerous if any distractions occur.   And she gave me this to give to you.”   She handed the bundle to Ranma.<p>
  Puzzled, he slowly unwrapped the bundle, and his  breath caught.<p>
  On the silk lay Zhu Shu’s swords, minus the long  ribbons.<p>
  Ranma stood, holding the bundle reverently.  “Yes. On my honor, no-one shall pass.”  He escorted Kasumi to the dojo and bowed to  her.  “Tell Zhu Shu, her honor is safe  with me.”<p>
  Kasumi smiled.  “She  said she already knew that… but she’s not the one who you are guarding  tonight.  She said it was Akane who  needed protection…”<p>
  Ranma nodded, stroking his hair nervously.  “Uh… well… I will keep them both safe.”<p>
  With a final smile and nod, Kasumi slid the dojo door  closed.  Ranma turned and sat on the step  and placed Zhu Shu’s swords on his lap.   What could she be doing tonight that would prompt her to ensure Ranma’s  vigilance by giving him her swords?  It  meant she was placing her life in his hands.<p>
  What could she be doing?</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>From the shadows beside the dojo, a faint sigh issued  from a pair of perfect lips.  This Ranma  seemed to be a nice boy, but he seemed as shy as her darling Keiichi.  Well, at least she had planted the question  in his thoughts.  Maybe it would  eventually give him the courage he needed to admit his heart.<p>
  She smiled as he sat before the dojo and assumed  guard.  It was so obvious he cared for  Akane, and that he had an enormous heart buried beneath that rough  exterior.  If Urd succeeded in granting  Shan Pu’s wish, then the Amazon would indeed have a happy life with her Ai Ren.<p>
  Which meant she had to get busy with her part.  She turned to the dojo wall and murmured a  chant, a glowing circle of light patterned with mystical symbols forming around  her hand.  Normally, she wouldn’t do  something like this, but Urd had been adamant that something had to be done to  make a change, and faced with a choice of doing the spell, or leaving it up to  Urd’s potions, Belldandy had relented.  She  wanted her sister to succeed in her present task, and was worried that  Kami-Sama had given what was proving such a difficult case to Urd.  She had been instructed she was allowed to  aid Urd if asked, and hoped Kami-Sama wouldn’t view this as overstepping her  bounds…</p>
<p>* * * * * </p>
<p>Zhu Shu sat motionless in the center of the dojo,  meditating and cleansing her chi flows.   Before her sat a bowl of strong tea that had a pungent, spicy odor.  The vapors from the tea helped her deepen the  trance, calming the raging flows of emotion kindled earlier in the day.  She needed to be absolutely calm and centered  for what she planned to do tonight.  She  had racked her brains since yesterday night, but the only solution she could  think of that would teach Akane what she needed to learn to win her match was  this.  She had spent the last few hours  following her cold bath preparing the dojo and herself, reviewing all the  things her teacher had done when she had undergone this same process almost  nine months ago, learning a new technique in one night.<p>
  Akane could do it, she knew.  She had the training and the skill, but not  the confidence or patience, or for that matter the co-ordination at the  moment.  She had the potential, but had  never bothered to learn to be graceful.   Zhu Shu had to bypass all of that.   She had to get past Akane’s subconscious resistances and preconceptions  of what she <em>should</em> do, and get her  body and mind to learn the techniques so well they were reflexes, something  done without thought…<p>
  Akane entered, a curious look on her face, but wearing  the Indian dance outfit that Zhu Shu had left for her in her room.  She started to ask about it, but stopped when  she saw Zhu Shu dressed in a matching outfit.   When Zhu Shu didn’t move, she proceeded to the training mat, and sat  across from her in the same pose.<p>
  After Akane had settled, Zhu Shu spoke, her state of  extreme concentration perfecting her Japanese.   “You are here to learn the Dance of Shiva, and in doing, you will learn  the art of the ribbon.  We have no time  for you to learn it in any normal way, as there are only five days to your  match.  I can teach it to you tonight,  but I must first know the true answers to two questions.”<p>
  Akane nodded.  “I  will answer truthfully, sensei.” she replied formally.<p>
  “Is defeating Kodachi worth this?  You will be changed by this, you will learn  things you may not want to know.   Teaching you the Dance this way is all or nothing, to master it, you  must give up all you know, only to regain it as you absorb what you have  learned.  It may be weeks before you  recover the knowledge of the martial skills you have now.  Is <em>he</em> worth this?”<p>
  Akane thought about it for a long moment.  She had no idea that what Zhu Shu had planned  was so drastic, but…<p>
  Finally, she nodded.   “Yes.”<p>
  “Then I must ask my second question.”  She held up the bowl of tea.  “To train your body in what it must learn,  you must relinquish your will, give up thought, give up time.  You must exist only in the now.  If you drink this, you will lose all conscious  control, able to do no more than obey my commands.  You will see and hear everything, but you  will be a passenger in your own body as the dance controls you, and burns  itself into you.  There is danger in  this, for you will obey any command, even those that will result in your  death.  For two hours, you will be a  slave to anyone who commands you.”  Zhu  Shu opened her eyes to look directly into Akane’s.  “So I must ask you.  Do you trust me?”<p>
  Akane looked at the bowl, a slight hint of dread in  her eyes.  “Is it safe?”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “Ranma sits without, bearing my swords to bar all who might enter.  Kasumi sits here with the antidote if  needed.  I can make it no safer save to  seal us both in a vault.”<p>
  “Is it necessary?<p>
  “To learn the Dance in time, yes.”<p>
  Akane gulped.  She  took the bowl in both hands and closed her eyes before draining it.<p>
  Zhu Shu took the bowl from her and tossed it to  Kasumi.  At that signal, Kasumi started  the CD player and a low throbbing beat filled the room.  Zhu Shu rose, drawing Akane up with her.  “Open your eyes Akane-chan.  Move as I move, do as I do.”  She began a slow dance step, mirrored  flawlessly by Akane.<p>
  “Hear my words and remember.”  Zhu Shu started, the words said to her by  Sarhia, her teacher, coming to her lips almost unbidden. “To learn the Dance,  you must be the Dance.  Forget your fear,  forget your worry, forget your doubts and pride.  You can make no errors because the Dance  dictates your moves.  There is only  yourself, and your partner, be they rival or companion.  The Dance defines you.  You are motion, you are desire, you are  life.  You will only fail if you admit to  the possibility of failure, if you give less than your best.  You are the Dance.  Hear and remember.”  She moved into a more complex pattern as the  tempo increased.  “There is no time  during the Dance, Akane-chan.  All is  one, the future is the next step, the past is the one finished, the present is  your partner.”  In a flowing sweep, she  picked up her ribbons in a move still echoed flawlessly by Akane, the motion flowing  so smoothly that the ribbons twined about them both in a helix before settling  in to swirling patterns about them as the tempo increased again.<p>
  “There is more to the Dance than just motion.  The Dance is of the spirit as well.  To know the Dance you must release the locks  on your spirit.  Let your spirit flow,  let it rise, let it join in the Dance.   As you have abandoned your body to the Dance, so too must follow your  spirit.  Allow your spirit to flow as the  Dance wills!”  With that last command,  Zhu Shu released her own fading hold on her conscious mind and lost herself  within the Dance.  The moment she could  have stopped the training was past; from here it was all instinct and the  rapidly escalating effects of the potion they had shared.<p>
  As she relinquished her conscious mind, green tendrils  of light wisped along her ribbons as they caressed the ribbons surrounding  Akane.  After a few minutes, wisps of  blue flickered along Akane’s ribbons to twine with the green of Zhu Shu’s and a  breeze began to rise.<p>
  Kasumi watched from the sidelines as the glows from  both girls grew and the energies slowly formed globes around each other.  The tempo increased again and with a sudden  rush of glowing fire, the two were no longer mirrors, but separate parts moving  as a whole.  As they swirled into  complimentary dances, the wind in the dojo rose to a peak and streamers of blue  and green light began to merge into gold.<p>
  Entranced by the Dance, Kasumi lost track of time,  aware only of the patterns of light and motion before her.  Unnoticed, the CD stopped, but the music  continued, it’s rising tempo driving the Dancers even harder.  As the music rose to a fever pitch, a haze of  golden light swallowed the last of the streamers of green and blue, and a  soundless explosion lit the dojo.<p>
  Time ceased to exist…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Honey and Cinnamon…<p>
  Akane floated in a void, her mouth once more heavy  with the taste of honey and cinnamon, her skin on fire with a thousand  pinpricks of ice.  Energies she had never  felt before flowed through her, making her insides feel like they had melted  into liquid gold, and electric sensations jumped along her nerve pathways.  Slowly, like a glacier calving into the sea, the sensations faded and sorted  themselves into currents and flows that ran through her body and mind. <p>
  <em>Is this what Zhu Shu feels?</em> she thought  <em>Is this what it feels like to be aware of  your ki?</em><p>
  She opened her eyes to find herself staring at the  ceiling of the dojo, her sight blurred by a golden haze that seemed to fill her  head as much as her vision.  She tried to  set up, but for all of the energy flowing through her, she could not use any of  it to make her body respond.  With a  faint groan, she closed her eyes and fought with the wild floods of energy  within her.  After what seemed an eternity,  she finally tamed the raging surges and it settled into a broad placid river,  bringing with it bits and pieces of memories not her own: Faces she didn’t  recognize, names she couldn’t place.   They came in a sprinkling of images, like snowflakes that melted away  and were gone, leaving only the strongest to remain in the fore-front of her  mind.<p>
  A beautiful Chinese girl with cherry blossoms in her  pink hair to match her name, her face forever frozen in that last sad look as  she waved goodbye.  Behind the image of  her face emotions lay buried.  A grief so  strong that Akane could bear to only brush the fringes of it and another  emotion…<p>
  It wove through every hint of memory and even the  grief.  Every trace of the ghost of  memories associated with the girl bore its mark… every flash of a memory of  shared laughter, or the guilty pleasure of sneaking off to hear the stories  told by a blind old woman.  From every  memory it sprang, intertwined through   Zhu Shu’s very being and stretching beyond sight, beyond hope, in a link  that could never be broken.  Seeing it,  separate and apart from herself, Akane had no choice but to name it for what it  was, and recognize its echoes in herself.<p>
  Love.<p>
  It ran through her own memories as well; of Ranma when  he smiled, or the utterly shocked look on his face that one time in the  bath.  It had come to tinge the edge of  every memory she had of him, even the arguments, and seeing it so clearly, she  finally knew the answer to the first serious question Zhu Shu had ever  asked.  “Do you love him?”<p>
  Zhu Shu had been right.  Her heart had known all along.  It didn’t make Ranma easier to live with, or  change his irritating habits, or anything else… but that didn’t matter.  She knew… and with the knowing she realized  she had taken a step towards her own happiness.  <p>
  Carefully setting aside the memories of Zhu Shu’s lost  love, not wishing to probe them too deeply, she turned to the next strongest  memories that had somehow found their way into her head, memories of herself  and a purple haired Chinese girl sporting odango. A part of herself she couldn’t  put a finger on whispered the girls name… Shan Pu… and told her that she was…<p>
  Ranma’s Fiancée???<p>
  She tried to untangle it, but the memories of herself  and Shan Pu were intertwined and inseparable. Zhu Shu apparently thought of  both of them, equally, as Ranma’s fiancée…   Akane’s eyes snapped open again and she sat up to see a dazed Zhu Shu  supporting herself on one hand and shaking her head to clear it.  Puzzled, Akane asked, “Who is Shan Pu?”<p>
  Dazed, off guard and unprepared for the question, the  Mandarin girl answered automatically.  “Ranma’s  Amazon fiancée and my blood-sis… ter…”   As she realized what she was saying she trailed off, looking in dread at  Akane.<p>
  Kasumi, recovering her own wits nearby, gasped. “Ranma’s  fiancée?”<p>
  Glumly, Zhu Shu nodded.<p>
  Akane rubbed her temples. “Zhu-chan… when were you  going to tell me about her?” a undercurrent of anger tinted her voice.<p>
  “Zhu-chan?” Kasumi’s voice held more of a plea for a  reason to understand.<p>
  Zhu Shu sat and folded her legs under her. “Akane-sama,  Kasumi-sama, I must beg your forgiveness, but I could not tell you.”<p>
  “Why!” Akane glared. “I trusted you! Why didn’t you  tell me!”<p>
  “Please, Zhu-chan. Tell us why you kept this from us?”<p>
  “Because… because I did not have a choice. Shan Pu  gave Ranma the Kiss of Death when he defeated her.  By Amazon law she would have hunted Ranma  down and killed him, believing him female, but <em>I</em> told the Amazons about his curse.   Shan Pu gave the Kiss of Death to Ranma’s female half for defeating her  in battle, but Amazon law dictates that a <em>man</em> who beats an Amazon must marry her. Shan Pu <em>has</em> to marry Ranma, even if she has to kill his other fiancée. But when I found  Ranma, I found Akane, and saw that Ranma and Akane cared for each other,  whether they would admit it or not. If Shan Pu had come too soon, before I had  a chance to prepare things, she would have killed Akane.  Ranma would have been devastated and most  likely would have hated her. Shan Pu is my blood-sister. Ranma is my friend.  Akane has become my friend. What was I to do?   As Shan Pu’s blood-sister, I too am bound by Amazon law to see Ranma wed  to Shan Pu, but Ranma loves Akane.   Without her, he will never be happy.   I can’t let Shan Pu kill Akane, but if she doesn’t marry Ranma she will  be disgraced and would probably kill herself in shame…”  Her voice broke.  “I <em>had</em> to find a way to arrange things for both Akane and Shan Pu to marry Ranma, to  make her a sister-wife by Amazon custom… I couldn’t bear to let Shan Pu kill herself…  I already have one suicide I’m responsible for… I couldn’t bear another!” Sobs  racked her as she collapsed in tears. “It’s the only way I could make everyone  happy and no-one had to die!”<p>
  Kasumi reached out to hold her close and stroke her  hair. “Oh, you poor dear… You’ve been doing this all this time, just so you  could make <em>all</em> of your friends happy?”  She looked at Akane. “I think it’s a  wonderful thing you’ve done.”<p>
  Akane looked guilt stricken. “Zhu-chan, would Shan Pu  really kill me?<p>
  Zhu Shu’s agonized eyes gave her the answer.  Akane had to look away.  “Who- who’s suicide do you think…” her  whispered question trailed off as she realized she knew the answer even as she  asked… and why Zhu Shu would rather die than see another friend lost… the knowledge  was there in the memory of her face as she waved goodbye…<p>
  “Ying-Ying didn’t <em>fall</em>…”  she whispered.<p>
  She threw herself across the floor to hold Zhu Shu as  well, tears falling from her eyes. “I’m sorry! I didn’t know.  I never realized…”<p>
  Kasumi held both the sobbing girls until they had  quieted, stroking their hair until they cried themselves out. For long moments  they let themselves be comforted until finally Akane asked “What is Shan Pu  like?” as she rubbed her eyes.<p>
  Zhu Shu sat back on her feet and looked down at her  hands. “She’s the Amazon’s Champion.  A  very strong warrior.  She can be a  vicious enemy or a wonderful friend.  I-  I miss her very much.”<p>
  “Will… will I like her.”<p>
  “I hope so. She’s like you in a lot of ways, like  Ranma in a lot of ways, even like me in some ways. She is an Amazon.  She has a lot of honor and pride.  She’s the strongest Amazon warrior of her  generation.  Ranma’s the only person to  beat her since she turned thirteen.  She  has a very strong will, like you.”  She  looked up to meet Akane’s eyes.  “I fear  you will squabble with her worse than you and Ranma do.  She’s under no obligation to love you like  Ranma, and she won’t settle for the role of a lesser wife.  She must be first, or equal.”<p>
  “So… I have to accept her as a second wife, or she’ll  kill me?”<p>
  “It’s the Amazon way.   They are even older than Clan Dragon. Even the Communists fear them.”<p>
  “And Ranma was stupid enough to get us in this  position.”  She sighed.  “Oh well. I guess I’ll deal with her when she  shows up.  One Fiancée at a time.   I can’t say I’m thrilled at the thought of a  mystery fiancée, but-“  She smiled at Zhu  Shu. “-I <em>had</em> contemplated the idea of  sharing him.  Just not with an Amazon.”  She looked around the dark dojo.  “I guess it’s a good thing Ranma’s guarding  the door.  A fine sight we must look  huddled on the floor like this.”  She  stood and bent to kiss Kasumi on the forehead. “Thank you… for being a  wonderful big sister.”  Kasumi blushed as  Akane turned to Zhu Shu. “I- I think I know now why you said no.  You’re in love with me aren’t you?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked away.<p>
  “You’re afraid you wouldn’t be able to let me go  afterwards. I understand it now.”  She  offered her hand to the Chinese girl and helped her to her feet.  “If you want the truth, Zhu-sama…” she whispered  gazing into her eyes, “…I’m not sure I could have let go afterwards  either.  I don’t know if I could have  been able to chose between you or Ranma.   I might have ended up breaking both of your hearts if I had to  choose.  Why do you think I’ve thought about  sharing?”  She looked at the ribbons  lying on the dojo floor where they had fallen. “That’s why it got out of hand  isn’t it?  When our ki touched, neither  of us wanted to let go… we bound ourselves so close I have some of your  memories… I know now how to recognize love from your memories of it… and my  feelings for Ranma and you.”  She hugged  Zhu Shu close.  “I will find a way to  repay you for all you have given me, I will find a way to allow you the  happiness you deserve… I swear I will.   And I’ll try to accept Shan Pu.   For you.” <p>
  They shared the hug for a long moment before Akane  stepped back and turned towards the dressing room, then hesitated, looking back  at Zhu Shu.  “It’s funny, you know… you  still glow gold…”  She turned and  disappeared into the dressing room as Zhu Shu and Kasumi stared after her.<p>
  As the door slid shut, Kasumi asked.  “Glow gold?”<p>
  Zhu Shu looked at her wide eyed.  “She’s seeing my aura… chi… She’s right.  I had green chi, but now, it’s gold… so is  hers…”<p>
  “She moves like you too… so fluid, and she feels  different somehow.”<p>
  Zhu Shu buried her face in her hands.  “I am a fool. I should have seen this would  happen.  Akane’s a complete novice in chi  manipulation.  When we blended… we couldn’t  unblend… We- we’re sisters now in the same way Shan Pu is my sister.  Our chi is bonded, but where only a small  part of my chi is bonded to Shan Pu, much more has been bonded between us.  I did not expect that.  When Sarhia taught me the Dance this way,  nothing like this occurred.”<p>
  Kasumi looked after her little sister.  “I very much doubt she will mind one bit ,  Little Mouse.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded. “I certainly hope so…”</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Akane smiled as she opened the door to the dojo and  saw Ranma setting on the step, his red aura flickering faintly as he breathed.  The swords in his hand moved a bare fraction  as he tensed at the sound of the door, then relaxed as he recognized her.  “Oh.   It’s you.  You ok?  It sounded like you were pushing pretty hard  in there earlier.”<p>
  She smiled even more broadly.  He’d been curious, but had kept his  promise.  She nodded.  “I think, in many ways, I’m finer than I ever  have been before Ranma-chan.”  She looked  out over the garden and fingered her braid.   “I think I learned more tonight than I have in my entire previous life,  I certainly have a lot to think about.”   She looked up at the few stars visible through Tokyo’s light pollution and smiled.  “Have you ever noticed the stars, Ranma?”<p>
  “Yeah… out on training trips with Pops, I looked at  them all the time.  When you’re out away  from the city, you can see them fill the night sky.  Once, I stood on a mountain where all I could  see in my entire vision was the night sky.   I almost felt like if I just pushed off, I could fall into the sky…”<p>
  Akane looked at his face and saw he was looking up at  the stars as well.  The revelation  surprised her.  She’d never thought he  could be sensitive.  He caught her  looking and looked down at her.  “What?”<p>
  “Nothing… just…”   She smiled.  “Make sure Zhu Shu  and Kasumi get to the house alright.”  She started across the walkway to his puzzled  look.<p>
  Halfway across, she stopped and looked back. “Before I  go though, I think you should know two things… One.  I don’t think you truly realize what kind of  a friend Zhu Shu really is…”  She stopped  and looked at him directly. “And two.   And this one you had better remember, Ranma Saotome.”  The strange light in her eyes made him  swallow.  “I love you.”<p>
  She left him there, staring after her with no words he  could find worth saying…</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>In the deepest shadows by the dojo wall, another  guardian watched their exchange and smiled.   At least this part of Urd’s crazy plan seemed to have worked.  He looked down to the angelic face of his  most beloved Belldandy, cradled in his lap as she slept.  He tucked his Nikomi Tech jacket closer  around her shoulders as she smiled and snuggled closer.  It would be pointless to try and wake her for  several hours yet.  She always had to  sleep whenever she had created a major spell, and she had worked this one for  almost an hour and a half before passing out.   He’d ask her later what the point of those two colored balls of light,  one blue, one green, she had joined into a single ball of golden light.  She’d stared in to it for over an hour before  releasing the spell and falling asleep.   Maybe for once, her explanation of it would be something he could  understand. </p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>Ranma turned as Kasumi and Zhu Shu exited the  dojo.  “No-one came in, but Nabiki wanted  to know what the light show was.  Pop and  Mr. Tendo showed up too, with that weird voodoo guy in tow.  Wouldn’t tell me where they’d been all  week.  That Voodoo guy said there was a ‘heap  o magic’ flowing out of there, but he didn’t want anything to do with a ‘Loa’  that big, whatever that means.”  He  handed Zhu Shu back her swords.  “I have  guarded your Honor and now return it to you unshamed.”<p>
  Zhu Shu took the swords.  “I thank you for that guarding.”  She bowed.<p>
  Ranma nodded.  “What’s  up with Akane?  She was acting kind of  weird.”<p>
  Zhu Shu nodded.   “The training didn’t go exactly as I planned it.”  She looked up as the light went on in Akane’s  room.  “And truth to tell, I don’t know  yet if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. I don’t know at all…”<p>
  Ranma tilted his head at her.  “Zhu Shu, what happened to your accent?”<p>
  “What?  I can’t  help having an accent.  I would have  thought you’d be used to it by now…”<p>
  “I am… but it’s missing.”<p>
  “What?”<p>
  “He’s right.”   Kasumi added.  “It wasn’t there in  the dojo either.  You’re speaking  Japanese fluently.”<p>
  “Yeah, much better than the broken pidgin you usually  speak.”<p>
  “I’m Mandarin. I speak a proper tongue! If I have  trouble wrapping my tongue around… around…”   She broke off as she realized she had been about to punch Ranma into  next week, and that he was cringing.<p>
  “Jeez, Zhu Shu, what’s got into you?  I’d expect that from Akane, not you!”<p>
  She unballed her fist and stared at it in  astonishment.  She’d never punched  anything in her life.  All her training  and reflexes were with her swords or ribbons, and she’d been trained to channel  anger into her chi.  Her reaction to the  casual barb from Ranma was as alien to her as… as…<p>
  Akane’s ability to see auras?<p>
  She searched her emotions to try and find what had  sparked her sudden rage, and almost cried when she found it.<p>
  Didn’t he realize how much his words could hurt  her?  How could he insult her like  that?  Didn’t he realize she… <p>
  Loved him?<p>
  Memories and emotions not her own lurked inside her  head, mixed into her subconscious…<p>
  Sisters indeed… in so much more than blood.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>From his seat in the shadows, Keiichi Morisato watched  as the Chinese girl burst into tears and was lead away by the taller Japanese  one, leaving Ranma standing speechless in the garden once more.  He looked down at Belldandy’s peaceful  face.  What had she done?  He watched as Ranma entered the main house  and settled himself, leaning his head back against the wall and looking at the  stars.  He hated to see girls cry.  He hoped the end results of Urd’s scheme made  what ever had just happened worth it, that for once in her career as a goddess,  she was doing the right thing…</p>
