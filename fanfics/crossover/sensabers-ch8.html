<a href="../crossover/sensabers-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Minako Aino reported in for work as usual, waving to
friends as she went over to her station and logged in.
The blonde pushed her hair back as she slid her
earpiece on, calling up files from her absence and
swiftly scanning them for information.

&quot;No, I am not letting this go,&quot; the woman sounded
angry, and Minako looked up in time to see Usagi
Tsukino barge out of the chief&#39;s office.

Haruna Sakurada followed Usagi out, her brown hair
tied back roughly. The older woman looked clearly
furious as she said, &quot;You are not authorized to
investigate the Tomoe case, keep your nose out of it!

&quot;This whole thing stinks, ma&#39;am,&quot; Usagi answered
coldly.

Haruna gentled her voice, &quot;The case is being
investigated by the regular police, it&#39;s been taken
out of our hands.&quot; A bit more firmly she continued,
&quot;I&#39;ll put you on suspension if I have to.&quot;

Usagi stood there in the middle of the station,
meeting the chief&#39;s eyes. &quot;So how much did it cost for
Infinity to buy you?&quot; she asked bitterly.

Haruna looked ready to strike her, she was that angry.
&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; she bit out, &quot;turn in your badge and gun,
you&#39;re on suspension as of now.&quot;

In the shocked silence Usagi smoothly unclipped her
badge, handing it over with her official
identification and police issue gun. Without a word
she turned, twin streamers of blonde hair swinging and
strode away.

&quot;What are you looking at?&quot; Haruna glared around the
room at the officers. She went back to her office as
she added, &quot;Get back to work.&quot;

&#39;Well, isn&#39;t this interesting,&#39; Minako mused, turning
back to her keyboard, &#39;Usagi really pushed the boss&#39;
buttons this time.&#39; She really didn&#39;t think that
Haruna was on the take, but she was pretty certain
people above the Chief were.

A flag was on one of Minako&#39;s warning systems and she
accessed it smoothly. Someone from outside the AD
Police had tried to access confidential personnel
files along with information on their equipment and
procedures. Even more unusual was that they had
covered their tracks so well there were no sign of
who, exactly, had done it.

&#39;This is bad,&#39; Minako thought, &#39;very bad.&#39; She sorted
out what had been copied even as she fielded her
normal jobs, routing vehicles and staff to areas that
they were needed. &#39;Whoever did this got almost a
complete overview of AD Police,&#39; she noted, &#39;just the
sort of thing they&#39;d need to take the entire
organization apart.&#39;

&quot;Computer, outside line,&quot; Minako ordered softly, &quot;code
Mercury.&quot; The system dialed, scrambling the
transmission as it did, and in seconds it was picked
up. &quot;Ami?&quot; Minako asked simply.

&quot;You don&#39;t normally call from work unless it&#39;s
important,&quot; Ami Mizuno noted, and Minako could almost
imagine the woman&#39;s curious expression.

&quot;Two things,&quot; Minako said crisply as she worked, &quot;the
AD Police system was badly compromised last night, a
massive amount of vital data was stolen.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Ami murmured, her voice hushed as she quickly
realized the implications. &quot;And the other thing?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Usagi Tsukino has been suspended for trying to
investigate the supposedly closed Tomoe murder case,&quot;
Minako said, &quot;she might just be a useful person to
contact, if discretely.&quot;

&quot;Any suggestions how?&quot; Ami asked her curiously.

With some amusement Minako said, &quot;Well, according to
the department grapevine a certain singer named Rei
Hino shot Usagi down recently....&quot;



&quot;There is no way in hell,&quot; Rei said firmly, the raven
haired rocker standing in the middle of her messy
trailer.

Makoto Kino sighed and ran a hand through her brown
hair, wishing she hadn&#39;t been tapped for this. The
martial artist didn&#39;t even really know Rei that well
yet, and here she was asking the woman to go pump
Usagi for information. &quot;Officer Tsukino might have
some information we need on Saturn,&quot; she said to her
hopefully.

&quot;I doubt she knows dick,&quot; Rei said to Makoto
scornfully, thinking back to her earlier meeting with
the woman.

Makoto chuckled softly at that, she couldn&#39;t help
herself. She decided to shift tracks a moment as she
took in the disaster are all around her. The floor was
covered by dirty clothes, magazines, and over in one
corner a motorbike, complete with plastic sheeting.
&quot;Does this room always look like this?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I cleaned up a bit before you came,&quot; Rei shrugged.
She looked thoughtfully, &quot;I noticed that Ami hasn&#39;t
called me since I walked out of the meeting a few days
ago... is she that upset with me?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Makoto shrugged slightly, &quot;though
Ami is notoriously hard to read. I think something
else is keeping her pretty occupied.&quot;

&quot;Saturn and the death of Prof. Tomoe,&quot; Rei made a
face. &quot;I wonder why she can&#39;t just chalk it up as one
for the good guys and let it go?&quot; she wondered.

Makoto studied Rei a moment, debating if she should
tell her what she was about to say. &quot;Revenge isn&#39;t
Ami&#39;s only objective,&quot; she finally said, &quot;it&#39;s much
more complex than that. Her mother had certain plans,
a dream for the Bio-boomers that Ami wants to
fulfill.&quot;

&quot;Plans like?&quot; Rei blinked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know everything but peaceful coexistence
between humans and Bio-boomers, the chance for
Bio-boomers to develop free will, all that sort of
thing,&quot; Makoto shrugged.

&quot;Assuming that Ami is right about Saturn,&quot; Rei noted
as she flopped down into one chair, &quot;I&#39;d think that
Hotaru would be all for that.&quot;

A great deal more tentatively Makoto cleared off a
seat and sat down. &quot;She&#39;s killed once,&quot; she reminded
her, &quot;and there&#39;s no reason she wouldn&#39;t do it again.&quot;

Rei raised her eyebrow in surprise, &quot;I thought you
agreed with me about Tomoe&#39;s death?&quot;

&quot;I do,&quot; Makoto said simply, &quot;his death probably made
the world a better place.&quot; She took a breath, &quot;I just
don&#39;t know if I trust Saturn to stop there.&quot;

Rei considered that for a few moments before she had
to concede, &quot;Point.&quot;

Getting back to the reason Makoto came here she said,
&quot;Look, just talk to Tsukino, all right? It may be a
wild goose chase but she may know something useful.&quot;

Rei groaned but answered, &quot;I&#39;ll think about it, all
right?&quot;



Kaori Knight paused in front of the door to the
company&#39;s chief executive, taking a steadying breath,
then knocked on it firmly. &quot;Come in,&quot; the voice called
out and the redhead went inside, quietly closing the
door behind her.

Hotaru Tomoe stood by the window, gazing out at the
city that stretched out around the Infinity tower. She
was slim, the black clothes that she wore highlighting
that slimness but there was an aura of strength about
her as well. She turned to her guest and smiled, her
violet eyes meeting Kaori&#39;s and seeming to hold them
irresistibly.

&quot;Ms. Tomoe,&quot; Kaori gulped, making herself walk forward
as she asked, &quot;I received a message you wanted to see
me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve wanted to meet you for awhile,&quot; Hotaru said as
she moved around the desk to offer her hand, &quot;but I&#39;ve
been preoccupied by details left over from my father&#39;s
unfortunate accident.&quot;

Kaori shook the offered hand without hesitation as she
said, &quot;It&#39;s entirely understandable, ma&#39;am. I hope I
can be as much help to you as I was to your father.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;ll be more helpful, Kaori,&quot; Hotaru waved
her towards a seat, &quot;and I&#39;d prefer if you called me
Hotaru.&quot;

Kaori kept her surprise off her face by long practice
as she answered, &quot;Of course, Hotaru.&quot; Part of
something the other woman said registered as she
asked, &quot;What did you mean, more helpful?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m promoting you, of course,&quot; Hotaru took her seat
behind the desk, &quot;to the company&#39;s executive director
position.&quot; She gestured to files on the desk, &quot;From
what I&#39;ve read you&#39;ve been performing that role
already for my father, I&#39;m just formalizing it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; the stunned Kaori managed to
answer.

&quot;Don&#39;t thank me yet Kaori,&quot; Hotaru offered a gentle
smile, &quot;with the promotion comes more paper work and a
larger workload.&quot;

Kaori sat up straight, &quot;I think I can handle it
ma&#39;am... I mean, Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Hotaru nodded firmly, &quot;I have a vision of this
company, of what it is and one day might become and
I&#39;ll need help to accomplish that.&quot;

&quot;Just tell me how I can help,&quot; Kaori answered.

&quot;One of the first things we need to do is deal with
Ami Mizuno,&quot; Hotaru said seriously, &quot;and the
vigilantes known as the Senshi Sabers.&quot;</pre>
