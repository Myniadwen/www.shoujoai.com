&quot;Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God,&quot; Bones heard the taller, dark 
haired girl mutter nervously as her shorter, blonde haired companion 
gently pulled her along. She thought they were both good looking 
women, and any extra weight that the dark haired girl might be 
carrying was put in all the right places.

&quot;It&#39;ll be all right, Francine,&quot; the little blonde said. She seemed to 
be filled with an intense energy, and looked up to give Bones a wry 
smile. &quot;Her first time,&quot; she explained cheerfully as they went by the 
dark haired bouncer.

&quot;But Katchoo, what if somebody asks us to dance?&quot; Francine said to the 
blonde.

Katchoo smiled up at Francine as she took her arm and said 
comfortingly, &quot;We&#39;ll just tell them that we&#39;re married, OK?&quot; Under her 
breath Katchoo added, &quot;Not that I would mind that.&quot;

They left the hallway to enter a main room, and were met by a happily 
beaming young lady wearing bunny ears. &quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s 
Locket,&quot; Hitomi beamed. Along with the ears she had a cute little one 
piece swimsuit on and a fluffy tail stuck firmly on her bottom.

&quot;Uh, hello,&quot; Francine smiled back at her.

Katchoo grinned happily. The girl had to be the most non-threatening 
woman on Earth, and therefore the best person for Francine to meet. It 
was impossible to panic confronted by a cute kid in bunny ears. &quot;Are 
there any tables open?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Just by the dance floor,&quot; Hitomi shrugged, &quot;we&#39;re crowded tonight.&quot; 
She reached into a Easter basket beside her and gave them each a foil 
covered egg, &quot;Happy Easter!&quot;

Juri noticed the two women coming in, then reached up to adjust her 
own bunny ears. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I let Nabiki talk me into this,&quot; she 
muttered. She flat out refused to wear the bathing suit and tail, 
however, and had stuck with her usual casual suit.

Ryouko snickered. She wore just the bunny ears, too, while Minagi 
beside her had decided to wear the top of a tux, and a bathing suit 
underneath. &quot;It ain&#39;t that bad, Juri,&quot; she said.

Minagi pulled a watch from her suit top, &quot;I&#39;m late!&quot; Juri rolled her 
eyes, and Minagi said, &quot;I&#39;m going back to see Sasami, OK?&quot;

&quot;Knock yourself out,&quot; Ryouko waved, and Minagi walked through the back 
wall into the pantry, then onward into the kitchen.

The kitchen was bustling, cooks moving around quickly to handle 
various jobs. Ukyo and Shampoo were working together in one part, 
Mahoro was dicing vegetables in another, and three ladies were 
scrubbing dishes in the sink.

Naga, Lina, and Filla noticed her arrival, and Lina spoke up, &quot;Why do 
we have to do this?&quot;

&quot;Because you didn&#39;t pay your bar tab,&quot; Minagi said pointedly.

&quot;Minagi,&quot; Sasami cried out happily, and bounded around the corner in 
her pink bathing suit and bunny ears. She shimmered, and for a moment 
assumed the adult form of Tsunami to place a thorough kiss on the 
surprised woman.

Out in the bar a dark haired woman slow danced with her shorter brown 
haired girlfriend. The taller girl wore a simple white shirt and dark 
pants, while her companion wore a long skirt and two bands of cloth 
across her breasts.

&quot;Mill, how did you find out about this place?&quot; the taller girl asked.

Princess Mill smiled up at her sweetly, &quot;I asked Solude about it, 
Maze.&quot; She cuddled close to her, &quot;I even booked us a room upstairs 
later.&quot;

&quot;Upstairs?&quot; Maze sweatdropped, &quot;What&#39;s upstairs?&quot;

Mill didn&#39;t answer, just smiled mysteriously.

Excel and Hyatt were taking a bit of a break, standing together near 
the library. Hyatt put her hand on Excel&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Sempai?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Excel turned.

Hyatt pressed her lips to hers, gently passing melted chocolate from 
her mouth to Excel&#39;s. She pulled back and smiled, &quot;Happy Easter.&quot;

Haruka and Michiru made her way over to the bar together, a impish 
smile on Haruka&#39;s face. &quot;Too bad you didn&#39;t go for the whole outfit,&quot; 
she grinned at Juri.

&quot;Your regular orders?&quot; Ryouko asked, and with their nods she poured 
Haruka a sake and Michiru a wine cooler.

Michiru took a sip of her drink, &quot;What&#39;s going on with you and 
Setsuna?&quot; At Juri&#39;s look she added, &quot;She came home quite agitated from 
your last date.&quot;

Juri shrugged, &quot;We&#39;ve hit a bit of a roadblock.&quot; She sipped her glass 
of ginger-ale, &quot;But I think we&#39;ll work it out.&quot;

The dark haired figure slipped through the crowd, and Juri&#39;s eyes 
widened as soon as she saw her coming. Setsuna grinned at Juri&#39;s 
reaction, turning about to show off her bunny tailed swimsuit. The 
white bunny ears flopped slightly as she tipped her head and smiled, 
&quot;I borrowed a suit from Mahoro, I hope you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

It took Juri a moment to regain her composure, &quot;You look great.&quot;

Setsuna leaned forward to gently press her lips to Juri&#39;s cheek, &quot;I 
thought you&#39;d like it.&quot; She smiled impishly, &quot;You&#39;ll get your other 
Easter gift tonight.&quot;

Juri blushed redly while Haruka and Michiru smirked.

Across the bar there was a loud whap! Nabiki turned around to see who 
slipped her ass to meet a redhead&#39;s impish gaze. &quot;Ayeka,&quot; Nabiki 
frowned, rubbing at her sore bottom.

Ayeka Kisaragi smirked, &quot;Sorry, but you looked so cute in that bunny 
suit.&quot;

Nabiki straightened out her bunny ears, which had gotten a bit 
lopsided, then fixed her short dark hair. &quot;I&#39;m glad you came in 
today,&quot; she smiled.

Ayeka looked her up and down, grinning, &quot;I&#39;m glad I came in too. You 
look good in a bathing suit, my dear.&quot;

Nabiki blushed, &quot;Would you care to dance?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Ayeka pulled Nabiki over to the dance floor.

&quot;I still don&#39;t quite understand Easter,&quot; May admitted to Keiko as they 
cleared off a dining table. Like everyone else on the staff, her 
maid&#39;s uniform had the addition of the bunny ears. They actually 
worked pretty well to hold back her long brown hair, so she didn&#39;t 
mind.

Keiko adjusted her bathing suit, a bit of a blush to her cheeks, &quot;It&#39;s 
a western holiday, really. There&#39;s even been pagan festivals around 
this time of year, too.&quot; She shrugged, her long brown braid swinging, 
&quot;But personally, I just see it as an opportunity to exchange chocolate 
and snuggle with your sweetie.&quot;

May laughed softly, &quot;That&#39;s good enough for me.&quot;

Up on the karaoke stage, a brown haired young woman in a black and 
blue bodysuit was singing, &quot;All the young girls love Alice, tender 
young Alice they saved, come over and tease me, come over and please 
me, Alice, it&#39;s my turn today!&quot;

She bounced off the stage to be met by a woman with twin white streaks 
in her hair, &quot;That was great, Kitty!&quot;

Kitty grinned, &quot;You want to do a duet next, Rogue?&quot;

&quot;Maybe later,&quot; a laughing Rogue led her over to their table.

&quot;A interestring choice of song, Kitten,&quot; Ororo smiled, pushing her 
white hair back with a dark brown hand.

&quot;Well, I liked it,&quot; Raven smiled. She had resumed her natrural red 
haired and blue skinned form, and no one around them seemed to be 
startled in the least.

&quot;Do you want to go up and try it?&quot; Heather asked. The busty blonde had 
an impish smile on her face as she looked at her dark haired lover 
beside her.

&quot;It&#39;s not quite my thing,&quot; Sage murmured, her blush showing visibly on 
her pale skin.

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Kitty whispered, grabbing at Rogue&#39;s arm, &quot;that&#39;s Yomiko 
and Nancy from Read or Die! And there&#39;s Haruka and Michiru!&quot;

&quot;Take a deep breath,&quot; Rogue reminded her hyperventilating lover 
gently.

The Staff: The bar&#39;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Minagi, Sasami and Ryouko are from the series Tenchi Muyo. 
Keiko is also from Utena. Cyberdoll May is from Hand Maid May. Mahoro 
is from Mahoromatic. Bones is from www.coolcatstudio.com. Hitomi is

just the product of my out of control imagination. Back in the first 
episode of that series I had mentioned that Kitty was an anime fan, 
and saw Read or Die, so... </pre>
