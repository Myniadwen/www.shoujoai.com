	Ami led the way into the living room and sat shyly on the couch 
next to Michiru who moved over, a gesture for the rogue to sit between 
her and the blue haired girl.  All eyes were on the tall teen as she sat 
gracefully on the couch, stretching her arms along the back side of it 
behind the other occupant&#39;s heads.  Emerald eyes danced as they took in 
all the pretty girls sitting and laying in various spots across the 
room.

	Makoto took delightful note that there was not a male in sight.

	Minako cleared her throat, speaking animatedly, &quot;We have another 
guest tonight, though she is a bit late.  Everyone, officially meet Kino 
Makoto, &#39;The New Transfer&#39;.&quot;

	Utena shook her head as her new girlfriend introduced the chestnut 
haired girl, despite not having been formally introduced herself.  She 
chanced a glance at the genius, hoping that the girl was fairing well 
considering the way Makoto made her entrance.  To the pink haired girl&#39;s 
surprise, Ami was currently sporting a small smile and looked very at 
ease-compared to how tense she was earlier this evening, Utena would 
have to say she looked down right calm.

	&quot;Perhaps we should have everyone introduce themselves to Makoto, 
as I&#39;m sure she doesn&#39;t know all your names,&quot; Michiru&#39;s elegant manner 
of speech seemed to put the rest of the room at ease and Minako was the 
first on her feet.

	&quot;All right then!  I&#39;m Aino Minako, star volleyball player and soon 
to be school lead in the upcoming play the drama club is putting on!  My 
interests include idol chasing, reading up on celebrities, and sleeping!  
I&#39;m also a Libra and I love the color orange!&quot;  She flashed the emerald 
eyed girl a V-sign and an enigmatic grin, much to her companion&#39;s 
embarrassment.

	Ami blinked several times and watched Makoto out of the corner of 
her eye.  The girl didn&#39;t so much as crack a smile at the blonde&#39;s 
antics, but actually appeared as though she were absorbing and analyzing 
it.  Her demeanor was outwardly calm, but the blue haired girl sensed 
that inside she was churning and sifting through the information of her 
surroundings.

	Green eyes met up with baby blues and the rogue winked at the 
small girl, producing a blush.

	Utena was watching the interactions between the two and decided to 
take one for the team, in hopes that most in the room would not notice 
the blush across the genius&#39; cheeks.

	Not bothering to stand up, the pink haired girl stayed in her spot 
on the chair as she introduced herself, &quot;Ah, well, officially I&#39;m Tenjou 
Utena.  Er... I play basketball and am a new student at this school like 
you, Makoto-san.&quot;  She finally acknowledged the girl&#39;s eagle-eye gaze 
and nodded briefly, only to be surprised when the tall girl nodded back.

	From across the room came a loud squeal, &quot;This is sooooooo much 
fun!&quot;  Everyone looked to see the meat-ball head blonde jumping up from 
her redheaded friend&#39;s grasp.  &quot;I&#39;m Tsukino Usagi!  You can call me 
Usa-chan!  Or Bunny!  I like eating and drawing cartoons.  My favorite 
foods include onigiri, apple pie, cake, ice cream, curry, ramen, 
strawberry short cake, jello, chicken strips, hamburger, hot dogs, ice 
cream sundaes, French fries, meatloaf, potato chips, spaghetti, 
spaghetti and meatballs, garlic bread, pocky, strawberries...&quot;

	Everyone stared at the girl in awed rapture as she spouted off a 
never ending list of foods; everyone, that is... except Makoto.  The 
chestnut haired girl had settled for a view of the small girl sitting 
next to her and watched intently as the smile on her face grew larger 
and less forced the longer the meat-ball head went on.  It was obvious 
to Makoto, that out of all of Ami&#39;s friends, Tsukino was the most 
prized.

	As if sensing she was being watched, the blue haired girl cocked 
her head in the rogue&#39;s direction and felt the breath leave her lungs 
when she looked into Makoto&#39;s intense gaze.  Usagi&#39;s rambling became 
background noise as Ami lost herself in those emerald eyes.  This was 
the Kino Makoto she was familiar with, the intense and overbearing rogue 
that the genius found herself enthralled with at first glance.

	It was that overbearing nature that allowed the short teen to take 
the first step in officially introducing herself at the hospital.  Most 
people would shy away from it and wait for Makoto to approach them 
first, but Ami found herself sympathizing and understanding that 
powerful strength.  Somewhere deep inside she knew the chestnut haired 
girl would understand her initiation.

	That day in the hospital, only just the week before, actually 
seemed many, many months ago.  The genius knew the reason for that, 
though.  Ever since Makoto transferred, Ami could not help but watch her 
every move, her every glance, and take note of her every action towards 
various students.  She was obsessed with the girl; an enigma, a ball of 
yarn where each length of string was a different color and a different 
texture.  The more you unraveled that ball, the more confused you became 
by it.

	&quot;JEEZE USA-CHAN!&quot; Ami finally tore her eyes away from Makoto to 
the redheaded girl who&#39;d so charmingly interrupted her blonde friend, 
&quot;Why don&#39;t you just say what foods you don&#39;t like!  Otherwise we&#39;ll be 
here all night as you list off every food in the known universe...&quot;

	Usagi blinked several times before turning back to the tomboy, &quot;I 
don&#39;t like carrots.&quot;  She stuck out her tongue for effect.  &quot;You know, 
though, speaking of food... we should help ourselves to that cake and 
ice cream, don&#39;t you agree Mako-chan?&quot;

	The tall girl raised an eyebrow at the meatball head, &quot;You all 
haven&#39;t eaten yet?&quot;

	Minako interrupted before anyone could respond, &quot;Yeah, well, Rei 
and Haruka are outside doing the dirty work, we didn&#39;t want to start 
without them.  And Usagi-hime is fine, don&#39;t listen to her.&quot;  Her blue 
eyes gave the blonde a narrow glance, &quot;You can go two hours without 
eating, you know...&quot;

	Before Usagi could begin another set of wails, the blue haired 
girl spoke up, &quot;I don&#39;t mind if Usagi, or anyone for that matter, wants 
to start in on the cake and ice cream.  I&#39;d rather it be enjoyed and 
eaten before it become stale.&quot;  And as if on an after thought, &quot;I know 
Rei wouldn&#39;t mind, as long as you left some for her.&quot;

	&quot;Haruka wouldn&#39;t mind, either way.&quot;  Michiru added.

	Everyone began to murmur in agreement about indulging in the 
goodies waiting in the kitchen until Utena interjected her own thoughts, 
&quot;How about we at least finish introductions before gorging ourselves?&quot;

	Ami turned to Makoto, silently asking the girl what she wanted to 
do.

	The rogue smirked, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter to me.&quot;

	&quot;Introductions, then cake, how&#39;s that?  I&#39;m sure you can wait just 
a few more minutes, Usagi-hime.&quot;  The volleyball player stated, leaning 
against the pink haired girl&#39;s legs.

	The meatball head grunted, but then mumbled that she could last 
just a little bit longer as long as everyone hurried up.

	&quot;You took the most time, Usa-chan, with your listing of foods...&quot;  
The redheaded girl snarled and then waved towards the rogue, &quot;I&#39;m Naru, 
by the way...&quot;


-------------------------------------------

	

	Rei was breathing hard as she walked up the steps after having 
chased a group of girls down them just moments ago.  They&#39;d been smoking 
near the well, flicking ashes down it as they pleased and the raven 
haired girl nearly blew her stack as she screamed like an Amazon.  The 
scream frightened the girls into running and the Miko wasted no time in 
following.  Luckily for them, Rei wasn&#39;t as adept at sports and simply 
screamed even more when she couldn&#39;t catch up.

	As she neared the top, she smiled to see the place was mostly 
deserted and decided to do one last check for any stragglers that had 
gotten left behind.  The fiery teen took in a deep breath, wiping the 
sweat from her brow and began one last trudge around the shrine grounds.  
She hadn&#39;t got as far as twenty feet when lavender eyes noticed a portly 
young man step out from behind some dark bushes.

	&quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot;

	He stayed half in the shadows, but Rei could tell he was about her 
age and had a mop of dark brown hair combed neatly across his wide head.  
The boy was wearing a simple button up shirt and slacks and his most 
noticeable feature was the protruding round belly which made him look 
pregnant.

	&quot;Hino Rei-sama, I&#39;ve come to give you a message,&quot; His voice was 
surprisingly not deep at all, but not girly; to put it simply, it 
sounded like he had yet to go through puberty.  The sexy teen crossed 
her arms in front of her chest, eyeing him suspiciously.

	&quot;Fuck off, you&#39;re trespassing on this property and I&#39;ve just about 
had it with you bastards tonight.&quot;  To her annoyance, he didn&#39;t make a 
move to leave.  &quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me?  I&#39;m not fucking afraid of you and 
don&#39;t really fucking care what you have-..&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;s about Kino Makoto.&quot;

	Rei felt her eyes widen and she closed her mouth abruptly.  After 
several seconds, she narrowed her gaze at the stranger and breathed in 
sharply before replying, &quot;What about her?&quot;

	Though it was dark, the raven haired girl could almost see him 
smiling in the shadows and he reached into his back pocket, producing an 
envelope.

	&quot;This, this is evidence.  I&#39;ve already tried warning your friend, 
Mizuno Ami, but she didn&#39;t heed it.  You&#39;ll all have to listen now, now 
that I&#39;ve got proof,&quot; his voice was rapture and moving excitedly as he 
spoke to Rei.  She cringed slightly as she felt bad auras coming from 
the young man; but her curiosity and animosity towards the roguish 
tomboy was too overpowering for her to pay attention to such things.

	&quot;What&#39;s in it?&quot;  She asked warily.

	He chuckled heavily, &quot;She&#39;s a criminal, you know.  The things 
she&#39;s done and probably will continue to do... unfortunately the police 
can&#39;t pin anything on her, so she&#39;s free to roam about.  But I&#39;m against 
having her at this school.  You could blow the whistle on her with 
this.&quot;

	Rei pursed her lips and as her voice became acid as she spoke, 
&quot;Then why not do it yourself?&quot;

	This seemed to take the boy by surprise as he faltered slightly, 
&quot;I... I&#39;m too connected.  It has to come from a pure source.&quot;

	&quot;If she&#39;s a criminal, why hasn&#39;t anyone else looked into this?  
You&#39;d think with all the fights and what not, someone would have looked 
into her background...&quot;

	&quot;Juvenile records are sealed off to everyone except the police and 
the family of the particular child,&quot; he retorted.

	&quot;So how did you get it?&quot; The lavender eyed girl was now much more 
suspicious of this young man.  If he claimed to have what he had, he 
would&#39;ve been just as dirty and tainted as Kino and that would make him 
much less credible.  While on the other hand, he could be making 
something up just to get in with the popular crowd and Rei wasn&#39;t in to 
the whole idea of creating lies about people.

	As if sensing her dilemma, the chubby teen set the envelope on the 
grass and pushed it over to Rei with his foot, &quot;My means of acquiring 
such information are secret.  But please, do check the facts if you feel 
it necessary.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be more than pleased.&quot;

	&quot;What did she do, exactly?&quot; Rei asked again.

	&quot;Oh, you know, the typical preteen stuff: breaking and entering, 
assault, murder, you know,&quot; Again, though she could not see his shadowed 
face, the raven haired girl could sense the smile in his voice, making 
her stomach slightly queasy.

	&quot;I&#39;ll leave it to you, Hino Rei-sama.  You care for your friend, 
don&#39;t you?  She&#39;s chosen to ignore the facts; I hope you&#39;ll be the voice 
of reason.&quot;  The dark figure turned to leave.

	&quot;Wait!  Who are you?&quot;

	&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; He responded as he continued to disappear 
into the shadows.

	Rei stared down at the envelope next to her foot.  She wondered 
why her Ami-chan would ignore such a warning as that wasn&#39;t like the 
logical girl-unless there wasn&#39;t a warning for her to ignore.  The Miko 
hadn&#39;t heard anything about it from the blue haired genius, neither from 
Usagi or Minako.
	
	She mentally slapped herself; of course she wouldn&#39;t have heard 
anything after the outburst she&#39;d had the other day at school, no doubt 
they were refraining from bringing up anything about the rogue so as to 
not upset her.  

	The envelope seemed to stare up at her like Pandora&#39;s Box, begging 
to be opened.  Could this be the evidence she needed to back up her own 
feelings about Kino?  Those restless nights were beginning to take a 
toll on the raven haired girl and if she could only express what she 
knew, perhaps the world would fall back into the place it was before the 
aggravation known as Kino Makoto entered their lives.

	Picking up the envelope, the Miko continued to walk the grounds, 
lost in deep thought.

	From behind a statue just a short distance away, a short dark 
haired girl with deep purple eyes emerged, with a look of discontent on 
her face.

--------------------------------------

	&quot;Mako-chan, why was that boy all bloody?&quot;  Dazzling blue eyes 
watched the tall girl keenly, fishing for whatever information lie 
behind the scene from earlier.  Minako had decided to keep her voice low 
and away from the others until she could sort out exactly what had 
happened; not that it mattered because come Tuesday, the rumors would be 
worse than those of the kidnapping.

	Makoto balanced two plates in her hands as she walked down the 
hall and didn&#39;t turn around when she answered, &quot;His nose was broken.&quot;

	A laugh escaped the blonde&#39;s lips.  This sounds like the Kino 
Makoto everyone knows best, she thought presumptuously.  She followed 
the rogue into the living room whose only current occupant was Ami.  It 
was curious that not a word passed between them, but yet the girl 
somehow knew that Makoto would bring back cake and ice cream for her.

	&quot;Really, Mako-chan, stop with the smart ass answers and tell me!  
You&#39;re really not the violent type, are you?  Well, not physically 
violent... though you do have the stature to be so.  You&#39;re so 
warrior-like, tall with taut muscles and an overpowering presence.  I 
bet in your past life you were a samurai.&quot;  Minako made a chopping 
motion, &quot;Hai-ya!&quot;

	&quot;Jeeze, if I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d think you were in love 
with Makoto-san.&quot;

	Two pairs of blue eyes looked up to see the pink haired girl 
standing in the door way with only a bowl of ice cream and a quirked 
eyebrow.

	The blonde girl merely rolled her eyes at her girlfriend, &quot;Just 
because I appreciate beauty in all forms...&quot;

	Utena snorted, &quot;Translation: You&#39;re going to ogle everyone so I&#39;d 
better get used to it?&quot;

	Minako nodded enthusiastically causing Ami to smile.  Makoto sat 
next to the blue haired girl, handing her the plate with cake and ice 
cream on it.  The two share a brief glance where the genius silently 
thanked the tomboy before turning back to the other two girls.

	Baby blue eyes blinked as they surveyed the plate in her hands, 
&quot;Um... You forgot my spoon...&quot;

	Makoto shook her head, reaching into the pocket of her corduroys 
and pulling out two spoons.  &quot;Didn&#39;t want to lose them on the journey 
back.&quot;  She handed the small girl a spoon and began to dig in to the 
cake on her plate with the other spoon.

	&quot;Aww... you two are so cute together.&quot;

	Ami blushed heavily at this statement and proceeded to nibble on 
small spoonfuls on the ice cream wishing she could just leave the room.  
Seeing this, Utena poked the volleyball player and gave her an 
admonishing look, motioning towards the reddened genius.  Minako stuck 
her tongue out at the pink haired girl and turned back towards the 
&#39;cute&#39; couple.

	&quot;Mako-chan, no more deterring, did you or did you not throw that 
guy through the door?&quot;

	Emerald eyes didn&#39;t bother to look up, &quot;I did not.&quot;

	Minako sighed again, &quot;Okay, I see what you&#39;re doing.  Did you 
cause the bloody nose on him?&quot;

	&quot;Nope.&quot;

	&quot;Are you in any way related to him getting thrown through the 
door?&quot;

	&quot;Yes.&quot;

	&quot;How?&quot;

	The rogue finally looked up from her plate; her eyes were smirking 
with amusement at the blonde on the floor.  &quot;I watched it.&quot;

	&quot;You watched it?&quot;

	&quot;Yep.&quot;

	&quot;Oh... who did it then?&quot;

	Makoto shrugged, &quot;A person.&quot;

	The volleyball player growled in frustration at the short answers 
she was being given.  Above her, Utena chuckled, forcing down her desire 
to laugh at the conversation.  Ami, who still hadn&#39;t looked up from her 
plate, was smiling inwardly at her girlfriend&#39;s antics.  It still felt 
weird to the blue haired girl, referring to this rogue as her 
girlfriend, but she liked it-though she probably wouldn&#39;t share it with 
anyone, not even Makoto; she just wanted it for her own pleasure for 
now.

	The blonde girl sighed, &quot;What is the name of that person?&quot;

	&quot;Tomoe Hotaru.&quot;

	All three girls froze instantaneously at the name.  Not only had 
Minako dropped her jaw, but her spoon as well, as she gawked at the 
chestnut haired girl.  Utena simply stared; she wasn&#39;t sure if the tall 
teen was telling the truth or not.  As for Ami, the smile she was once 
feeling had now turned to a frown.  Hotaru was a good friend of hers-the 
two often discussed various books while the genius was on duty in the 
library.

	&quot;You&#39;re not serious,&quot; the pink haired girl finally voiced.

	&quot;As a heart attack,&quot; smoothly replied the rogue.

	&quot;Why did she do it?&quot; The blue haired girl&#39;s voice was soft and 
disbelieving as she stared at the tomboy.

	Emerald eyes found baby blues and Makoto smiled sadly at her small 
classmate.  &quot;Don&#39;t go thinking anything bad about her.  She was simply 
defending herself-she didn&#39;t want to be here in the first place, but I&#39;d 
dragged her along.  I told her to get going after it happened because I 
didn&#39;t want her to get in trouble.&quot;

	Minako&#39;s dazzling blue eyes became teary, &quot;You&#39;re such a good 
friend, Mako-chan.&quot;  She smiled at the tall girl.

	&quot;Mm... Well, don&#39;t tell anyone that.&quot;  The chestnut haired girl 
smirked as the blonde laughed, &quot;And everyone outside this room is to 
believe that I assaulted him, is that clear?&quot;

	Utena and Minako nodded in understanding and continued on with 
their cake and ice cream.

	Ami&#39;s eyes still hadn&#39;t left Makoto and concern was still very 
evident on her face.  She was now very curious as to what could cause 
Hotaru to hurt someone like that.  Even if she was just defending 
herself, she&#39;d never seen the photographer use that violence nor had she 
heard anything about the girl being violent. The genius decided she 
would just have to ask the Goth about it at school; she would not betray 
the girl&#39;s friendship with Makoto by violating their trust with 
questions about the incident.

	She just knew-no matter how odd it felt to rely on such 
feelings-that the tall girl would never lie to her.

	Another glow presented itself inside the blue haired girl as she 
considered the chestnut haired girl once again.  Last night she had been 
so gentle, holding the genius in her arms and whispering soothing words 
to her while Ami cried against the rogue.  It&#39;d made her reconsider the 
cold, reticent nature of the Makoto she&#39;d watched at school.

	And now, with the way she was protecting Hotaru, Ami wondered if 
the green eyed girl wasn&#39;t simply a nice and wonderful person underneath 
all the roughness.  Perhaps the true personality of Makoto desired to 
break out from the harsh one she&#39;d erected.  The tall teen turned 
towards the scrutinizing gaze of the genius and gave her one of those 
rare smiles and Ami felt nothing but warmth spread through her body.

	&quot;WHAT THE HELL IS SHE DOING HERE?!&quot;  A shout came from the 
entrance of the living room.

	Everyone looked up to see Rei standing in the door way, flames 
shooting from her lavender eyes.

	All the warmth in the blue haired girl&#39;s body shot out as though 
someone popped a balloon inside of her.
