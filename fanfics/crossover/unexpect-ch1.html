<h1>Unexpected Arrival</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../crossover/index.html">Crossovers</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There were many hard things about transferring to a
new highschool, including leaving your old friends
behind, finding your classes and... the massive
fighting. The hallway where most of the first year
home rooms were was filled with chaos as the two young
men casually fought their way up the corridor,
defeating anyone who dared come their way.

&quot;Bob, these freshmen are getting boring,&quot; the young
man with spiked up hair told his darker skinned friend
as she casually dropped a musclebound boy with a
single punch, &quot;when are they going to get serious?&quot;

Bob Makihara dropped another fighter with a spin kick
to the head, &quot;Well Nagi, we&#39;ll just have to keep
moving till we hit the seniors.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to that!&quot; Nagi Souichirou
grinned, his long black coat flapping around him.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you two taking this just a little too far?&quot;
the tall, brown haired young woman asked, her pose
surprisingly relaxed considering the situation, pretty
red rose shaped earrings glinting in each ear.

&#39;Oh no,&#39; one of the young men up the hall thought as
the two men advanced on the girl, &#39;they&#39;ll kill her!
I&#39;d better get help.&#39; With that he bolted down the
hall, hurrying through the school until he finally
reached his destination, the house of the Juken Club.

&quot;... and you&#39;re interested just for the club?&quot; the
small, purple haired girl teased the young man archly
as they st in front of the building.

&quot;O... Of course!&quot; the boy stammered, his cheeks going
red. Admittedly he admired their new member, but
purely in a chaste way. Or at least, that&#39;s what he
kept telling himself.

&quot;Sorry to interrupt your club activities,&quot; he said to
them respectfully, &quot;but could Natsume-san come
immediately? There&#39;s trouble...&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Maya Natsume said, looking intrigued.

Not long after Maya was perched on her subordinate
Takayanagi&#39;s shoulder as they hurried down the hall
towards the sounds of violence. &quot;I&#39;m surprised he
refused to come along with us,&quot; he noted.

&quot;Just following the sound of fighting should let us
find them,&quot; Maya noted as they turned a corner, both
slowing as they saw what was happening.

A young lady faced off against two men, dozens of
others unconscious around them. She nearly shimmered
with power as she dodged and weaved between blows,
then struck out with devestating force. Whoever this
girl was it quickly became obvious the two guys were
totally outmatched, she was years ahead of them at
least.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Nagi muttered, &quot;where did you...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve had some training,&quot; the young woman said to them
wryly, her long ponytail swinging as she kept a wary
eye on them both. &quot;Look guys, I didn&#39;t start this...,&quot;
she said to them, &quot;why don&#39;t we just go back to class
and forget about it?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s got to be the one causing trouble,&quot; Maya
murmured from too far away to hear them taking, &quot;look
at her!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Takayanagi agreed, stunned by a girl for the
second time today.

Maya gave him a exasperated look and leapt down,
forcing her way through the onlookers to reach the
three fighters. &quot;Hey you brats,&quot; Maya called, &quot;I can
see you&#39;re strong, but you&#39;d better stop... or I&#39;ll
feel obligated to take you on myself.&quot;

&quot;Shut up, kid,&quot; Nagi yelled as his opponent easilly
dodged a blow, &quot;I&#39;m too busy to deal with elementary
kids!&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m seventeen!&quot; Maya muttered. Shaking herself
she said briskly, &quot;Ok, if you don&#39;t like my appearance
I&#39;ll change it!&quot;

With that a most startling transformation took place!
The oddly chibi girl streched and filled out
unnaturally, shifting from a seeming child to a well
filled out, leggy beauty, stunning everyone and
drawing cheers from the boys.

&quot;Toudou Gakuen Junior, Natsumi Maya,&quot; she purred as
she held her woden practice sword at the ready, &quot;has
arrived.&quot;

&quot;Bob,&quot; Nagi blinked, &quot;what do you do when a elementary
kid transforms into a waitress from a sketchy bar?&quot;

&quot;Dunno,&quot; Bob panted as he tried to land a blow against
their mysterious earlier opponent.

&#39;Better take out the bigger threat first,&#39; Maya
thought as she swept by Nagi and Bob, going for the
girl. She swept out with her sword only to see the
girl swerve back out of the way, taking up a
unfamiliar stance. &#39;She&#39;s better than I thought,&#39; Maya
realized, surprised.

&quot;Do you get the feeling we&#39;ve just become secondary
characters?&quot; Nagi leaned up against the wall tiredly.

&quot;Kinda feels like it,&quot; Bob agreed. He gestured towards
the two girls, &quot;You want to...?&quot;

&quot;Lemme catch my breath first,&quot; Nagi winced.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Maya demanded, taking up a battle pose.

&quot;First year,&quot; the young woman mirrored her pose
unconsciously, &quot;Makoto Kino.&quot; 

&quot;Well Makoto Kino,&quot; Maya readied herself, &quot;I promised
my understudies we&#39;d go to kareoke to celebrate, so
it&#39;s time to end this.&quot; With a shocking burst of speed
she attack, blows flying like lightning as she
searched for a opening, then with a decisive swing
sent Makoto crashing through a window.

&quot;Ah,&quot; the young man who had brought them into the
fight tapped Takayanagi&#39;s shoulder tentatively, &quot;it
wasn&#39;t her that started it, it was the two guys.&quot; 

&quot;Oh crap,&quot; Maya rushed to looked out the window where
she flung Makoto, seeing that she had crashed through
the roof of a nearby building.

&quot;A girl like that,&quot; Nagi winced as she rubbed his
head, sore from a powerful blow, &quot;isn&#39;t going to be
damaged by a fall.&quot;

&quot;That isn&#39;t the problem,&quot; Maya said as she hoisted
herself over the edge of the window, &quot;that&#39;s the
showers, and my sister&#39;s in there!&quot;

Makoto Kino groaned as she shook herself, still a
little stunned by the power of the blow. She had been
a delinquent for a while, at least since her parents
had died a few years back, and in none of her fights
had she ever been hit that hard. Pushing herself up
Makoto blinked, realizing she had landed on
something... soft.

&quot;Eeep!&quot; Makoto yanked her hand up from where it had
been resting on a bare breast, a blush staining her
cheeks.

The beautiful girl stared up at Makoto with the oddest
look on her face, her long light brown hair spread out
beneath her like a blanket. Her eyes seemed to shimmer
and darken as she pushed herself up, and in a
breathless tone she asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Makoto tried to get up and away, then
was startled as her arm was grabbed by one of those
lovely hands.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; she repeated, with emphasis. 

&quot;Makoto Kino,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry for...&quot;

&quot;Makoto, my name is Aya Natsumi,&quot; the pretty girl
reached out to grasp Makoto&#39;s head gently in her
hands, &quot;will you marry me?&quot;

&quot;Wha...?&quot; Makoto had no time to form a more coherent
reply when Aya firmly pulled her into a lingering
kiss.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Maya muttered from where she had just reached
the doorway to the showers, &quot;too late.&quot;

&#39;Nooo,&#39; Takayanagi mentally whimpered as he came up
beside Maya, seeing his dream girls kissing each
other.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Nagi muttered to Bob, &quot;that&#39;s hot.&quot;

&quot;Better not say that around big sis,&quot; Bob quietly said
as he nodded towards Maya, &quot;considering what she can
do,&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nagi agreed as both men walked away, &quot;if we&#39;re
gonna dominate this school, we&#39;re going to have to
rethink our plans a bit.&quot; 

Meanwhile, Makoto managed to pull free from her new
friend. &quot;Are you crazy?&quot; she blurted, &quot;You don&#39;t even
know me.&quot;

&quot;I know everything I need to know,&quot; Aya pledged as she
wrapped her arms arounf Makoto, &quot;we&#39;re destined to be
together!&quot;

&#39;The dragon&#39;s eye power,&#39; Maya realized, &#39;seeing
Makoto must have triggered it.&#39; She paused as she
thought, &#39;Or Aya is following the old family tradition
of marrying the first person who sees her naked...&#39;

&quot;Why me?&quot; Takayanagi moaned as Aya moved in for
another kiss.

To be continued...?

Notes: Spamfic based on Tenjho Tenge crossing over
with Sailor Moon. Specifically, I&#39;m imagining Makoto
without the civilizing influence of Sailor Moon and
friends... May or may not do a part two about Aya
chasing poor Makoto around school. lol
