<h1>Birthright (part 14 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mascots/birthrite-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Mia and Arine could do nothing to stop the images from flashing before 
their eyes. It was as if vast amounts of knowledge were pouring into 
them, being fed directly into their brains out of nowhere. The amount of 
information was so immense that the girls could not understand how they 
were able to comprehend it all.

Then, the images stopped and Mia and Arine found themselves surrounded 
by pure, white light. They looked at each other in confusion. &quot;Mia? 
Where are we?&quot; Arine asked, hoping that her girlfriend might know the 
answer.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; replied Mia, just as confused as Arine.

&quot;This is the realm of your minds,&quot; an older female voice said next to 
them.

Mia and Arine turned to the direction to the voice, seeing a beautiful, 
blond-haired woman standing before them. Although Mia had no idea who 
she was, Arine recognized the woman&#39;s face instantly. &quot;Olivia...&quot; she 
murmured.

As Mia and Arine looked at Olivia, two other figures appeared on either 
side of the elf. They were Erika and Rikhard. &quot;It has finally happened,&quot; 
Rikhard mused.

&quot;The Prophecy of Awakening has been fulfilled,&quot; said Erika.

&quot;Rikhard...Erika...&quot; said Mia in stun.

&quot;The realm of our minds?&quot; Arine asked.

&quot;It&#39;s the only way that we can communicate with you now,&quot; Olivia 
explained.

&quot;Our bodies have long since ceased to live,&quot; Erika continued.

&quot;But our spirits still exist inside the Red Ruby and Blue Sapphire of 
Alvara,&quot; finished Rikhard.

&quot;That&#39;s what you did!&quot; exclaimed Mia, remembering what she saw in her 
vision of Rikhard and Erika. &quot;You fed your spirits into your corundum 
crystals just before your deaths.&quot;

&quot;We needed a way to communicate with the Legendary Elves that would 
fulfill the Prophecy of Awakening,&quot; said Olivia. &quot;And the only way to do 
that was to find vessels for our spirits until the elves found them.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Elves&#39;?&quot; Mia said, surprised that Olivia had used the plural form of 
the word.

&quot;So Mia is an elf after all!&quot; said Arine, remembering how everyone 
stopped believing that Mia was the Legendary Elf when Arine&#39;s powers 
were discovered.

&quot;Two crystals for two elves,&quot; Erika said.

&quot;As I held the Blue Sapphire of Alvara in my hand just before the Jewel 
Summoners killed me,&quot; said Olivia, &quot;my elfin abilities were amplified by 
the Sapphire&#39;s power and I was able to see farther into the future than 
I was able to before. For one brief moment, I caught a glimpse of your 
awakening, how humans and elves worked together to fulfill my father&#39;s 
prophecy, and my faith in humans was restored.&quot;

&quot;Somehow,&quot; Arine said, &quot;I didn&#39;t see that part of the vision. All I saw 
in that fraction of a second was the soldier charging toward you and 
then impaling you.&quot;

&quot;What the elves understood,&quot; Olivia continued, &quot;is that time is much 
more fluid and malleable than it seems. Even during your vision, you 
were thinking like a human, just like you were brought up. You saw the 
soldier charging at me, and all that you could think about was the fear 
of losing your grandmother. You were not yet able to comprehend the 
universe that existed in that small fraction of a second before the 
finishing blow.&quot;

&quot;I understand now,&quot; said the 18-year-old. &quot;Those images that poured into 
our heads when the Ruby and Sapphire touched. Those were all of the 
knowledge and experiences of the elves.&quot;

&quot;All of the knowledge of the elves was locked inside the Ruby and the 
Sapphire,&quot; said Rikhard.

Erika then explained, &quot;But the only person that could unlock that 
knowledge was someone that understood both the power of crystals AND the 
power of the elves.&quot;

&quot;Me,&quot; Mia realized. &quot;I&#39;m the only descendant of an elf AND a Jewel 
Summoner.&quot;

Turning to Olivia, Arine said, &quot;This is a result of the fluidity of time 
that you spoke of.&quot; Then, addressing all three of them, Arine said, 
&quot;Death was not the end for you. The very fact that you lived at all 
resulted in the births of Mia and me. The birth of the two elves.&quot;

The three spirits smiled at their children. &quot;We are so proud of you 
girls,&quot; said Erika.

&quot;Not only have you fulfilled the Prophecy of Awakening,&quot; Rikhard 
continued, &quot;but you have also discovered the subtleties of actions, 
relationships, emotions, and the mystical energies that bind them 
together and allow the people of the world to evolve.&quot;

&quot;You have given us life again,&quot; said Olivia. &quot;You know what to do, 
girls.&quot;

----------

To everyone&#39;s amazement, Arine&#39;s injuries were completely healed and she 
was standing on her own two feet. Both she and Mia were kissing, their 
arms wrapped around each other, their bodies engulfed in a bright, 
magenta glow, their hair sparkling more brilliantly than it ever had 
before. As Johan managed to climb up onto the roof, his body suddenly 
started glowing red. In the streets, the people of Zurich had come out 
of their homes to find out what all of the noise was about. At that 
moment, several members of the crowd started glowing red and blue.

----------

At the Eiffel Tower, a man explained to other people at the base, &quot;I&#39;m 
telling you, about five minutes ago, I saw a bright, white light coming 
from the east.&quot; The other people were skeptical of the man&#39;s claim. 
However, a moment later, the truth of the man&#39;s story lost all of its 
relevance as the man&#39;s body started glowing bright blue.

----------

Meanwhile, the members of the Mustanen Clan were convened around their 
large, round table. One of the clan lords explained, &quot;Lord Odin has 
informed us that Sir Johan does not wish to leave.&quot;

&quot;What is Sir Johan thinking?&quot; another clan member questioned. &quot;Does he 
not care about his clan? His uncle?&quot;

Suddenly every member that was sitting around the table started glowing 
red. Even though the light was dim, their faces were now visible from 
the red light that had suddenly filled the room.

----------

Back in the United States, Arine&#39;s father was talking to the police. He 
explained, &quot;Yesterday, I had a strange feeling that my daughter was in 
trouble. I called her at college, but she didn&#39;t pick up.&quot; The police 
asked him why he had a feeling. &quot;No,&quot; Avery responded, &quot;I don&#39;t know why 
I got that feeling, but--&quot; Before he could finish his sentence, Avery&#39;s 
body started glowing bright blue.

----------

Elsewhere, a man and wife were sitting on the bed, looking at the 
results of a pregnancy test that they had just taken. When the couple 
saw that the results were positive, large smiles appeared on their 
faces. &quot;I&#39;m pregnant.&quot; the woman said.

&quot;I&#39;m going to be a father!&quot; the man cried in joy.

Suddenly, both the man and the woman started glowing. The woman was 
glowing red and her husband was glowing blue. For a moment, they just 
stared at each other, wondering what was going on. Just a moment after 
they started glowing, the woman&#39;s abdomen started glowing magenta, as if 
the embryo in her body was glowing as well.

----------

At the same time, in a low earth orbit, the International Space Station 
was moving over the dark side of the earth, the planet a thin crescent. 
However, as one of the crewmen was looking at the window at the earth 
below, the dark side of the planet lit up with small, glowing dots of 
red and blue light.

----------

&#39;What is this?&#39; wondered Johan looking at his glowing red body. &#39;What is 
this glow? The pain is gone.&#39; He then looked at Mia and Arine before him 
and realized what was happening. &#39;Is this the true awakening of the 
elves? Is this the beginning of the new age?&#39;

As everyone stopped glowing, Mia and Arine ended their kiss and looked 
into each other&#39;s eyes, both of their faces so full of happiness and 
fulfillment. In their hand was a large piece of corundum, bright magenta 
in color. The Red Ruby of Alvara and the Blue Sapphire of Alvara had 
fused together!

Mia and Arine turned to Johan, who was staring at them in awe. &quot;It&#39;s 
happened, Johan,&quot; Mia announced. &quot;There&#39;s no need for you to fight any 
more. The two Legendary Elves have awoken and the new age has begun. The 
elfin genes that were destroying your body have been neutralized.&quot;

&quot;As much as I hate to let you go free, Johan,&quot; said Arine &quot;locking you 
up won&#39;t do any good. You won&#39;t learn anything from it, and you&#39;re no 
threat to the Jewel Summoners with two pureblooded elves looking after 
them. Revenge never got anyone anywhere.&quot;

Johan was stunned by Mia and Arine&#39;s leniency. Not knowing exactly what 
to expect, Johan started moving toward the fire escape, cautiously at 
first, but then hastily. He slid down the ladder and ran off, 
disappearing into the crowd.

----------

For the first time in days, the Jewel Summoners were able to rest. With 
Johan gone and the elves revived, they no longer had anything to fear. 
Unfortunately, they had suffered casualties. 22 of their comrades were 
killed in the attack on their headquarters, and 3 more had since died 
from their injuries. Aside from the 27 deaths resulting from Johan&#39;s 
actions, including Erika Dagomar and Pierre Doulin, everyone else seemed 
to be recovering from their physical injuries.

The best that the Jewel Summoners could do for their emotional injuries 
was to hold a memorial service for their fallen comrades. After all of 
the survivors had slept for several hours, they congregated on floor B3 
for the ceremony. None of them had ever lost more than several of their 
comrades at a time. Because this ceremony dealt with the lives of 27 
people, it took much longer than any usual ceremony.

Each Clan Leader gave the eulogies for fallen members of their clans. 
Giovanni was the first to give eulogies, followed by Alana. Fredrika 
gave eulogies for the fallen members of the Dagomar Clan; and after 
Mia&#39;s vision of Erika&#39;s life and death, after twenty years, the leader 
of the Dagomar Clan could finally give a eulogy for her daughter.

Felix was the last of the Clan Leaders to give eulogies. Many of the 
congregation, including Sam, Mia, Arine, Yvette, and Pierre&#39;s sister, 
Rosette, considered Pierre to be the most influential of all of the 
Jewel Summoners. Felix spoke of Pierre&#39;s cheerful outlook on life, how 
he had aided Sir David and Madame Julia Lancestor in finding the elves, 
and how he had bravely sacrificed himself to save Mia and Arine.

After Felix had finished, and after Rosette and Arine had paid their 
respects to Lord Pierre as well, floor B2 was transformed from a 
training facility to a ceremonial hall, filled with food and drink for 
all. The ceremony continued there, not as much for mourning as it was 
for celebrating. The Jewel Summoners had completed their mission of 
making sure that the Prophecy of Awakening came to pass and that the new 
age of the elves began. Finally, at long last, the 1500-year-old stain 
of blood on their hands had been washed away.

Even though the celebration was for all of the Jewel Summoners and their 
friends to attend, Mia, Arine, and Sam decided to talk amongst 
themselves for a moment. Sam was still confused as to the events that 
had transpired the day before. &quot;One thing I don&#39;t understand,&quot; he said 
to the two elves. &quot;What exactly happened on that rooftop?&quot;

&quot;Basically,&quot; Mia started, &quot;the Prophecy of Awakening was not entirely 
accurate. There was not one Legendary Elf, but two. When the Red Ruby 
and Blue Sapphire of Alvara came together, a surge of mystical energy 
came from the union of the two crystals.&quot;

Arine continued, &quot;Along with that mystical energy was all of the 
knowledge of the elves, allowing Mia and me to realize our powers. But 
in order to unlock the power of Alvara&#39;s crystals, they needed someone 
with the powers of both elves and Jewel Summoners.&quot;

&quot;In other words, me,&quot; said Mia. &quot;I&#39;m the child of Erika Dagomar, a Jewel 
Summoner, and Rikhard Mustanen, an elf.&quot;

&quot;With the knowledge of the elves inside us,&quot; said Arine, &quot;we knew how to 
use our powers consciously, including a special power that I have. Johan 
knew that I had this gene, but he did not know what ability that gene 
granted. That particular gene creates microscopic structures on my skin 
that allows me to transfer DNA simply by touch.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I always felt so strong when I touched Arine&#39;s skin,&quot; Mia 
explained. &quot;She was transferring her gene of biological vigor to me, and 
it was actually the elfin powers that I was receiving from Arine that 
gave me strength.&quot;

&quot;It also explains why I&#39;ve become so outgoing since I met Mia,&quot; the 
blond-haired elf said. &quot;Although personality is affected greatly by 
social and environmental factors, some people have a genetic 
predisposition toward outgoingness, or shyness, or any personality trait 
you can think of. I was receiving the genes from Mia that made her so 
expressive.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; asked Sam, &quot;if you&#39;ve been exchanging genes this whole time, why 
didn&#39;t your powers backfire like they did with Johan?&quot;

Arine explained, &quot;The genes that Johan received from me weren&#39;t 
naturally occurring within his body. The genetic transfer between Mia 
and me is completely natural.&quot;

&quot;In fact,&quot; continued the brunette, &quot;it&#39;s an important part of the elfin 
mating process. Elves mate for life, and this exchange of DNA makes it 
so that two elves become a part of one another. The love between them 
simply grows and grows and grows.&quot;

&quot;And now,&quot; said Sam, &quot;You two are pureblooded elves.&quot;

&quot;Our elfin genes were complimentary,&quot; said Arine. &quot;Mia had all of the 
elfin genes that I didn&#39;t, and I had all of the elfin genes that she 
didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;There was a bit of overlap, though,&quot; Mia said. &quot;For example, we both 
had the gene of foresight. Remember how I somehow knew that I had to 
join Arine to confront Johan even in the condition I was in?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Sam, &quot;I remember.&quot;

As the three friends were having their discussion, another one of the 
Jewel Summoners approached them. She was young, no older than Arine, 
walked with a slight limp, and possessed the same flowing, brown hair 
that Mia had. &quot;Is that Lena Dagomar?&quot; Arine said, not knowing that Lena 
had recovered enough to walk.

&quot;What are you all doing here by yourselves?&quot; the brown-haired Jewel 
Summoner asked. She had a noticeable Nordic accent.

&quot;Just talking,&quot; Mia replied.

&quot;You seem to be recovering nicely, Lena,&quot; said Sam.

Lena then turned to Mia. &quot;Mia,&quot; she said. &quot;You are Erika&#39;s daughter.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said the brunette.

&quot;That means that I&#39;m your cousin,&quot; Lena said. &quot;Erika was my father&#39;s 
sister.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Mia realized, a large smile appearing on her face. &quot;I 
guess I am your cousin.&quot;

&quot;Strange how things turned out.&quot;

&quot;Strange, but happy at the same time.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Happy.&quot; Lena and Mia then took each other in their arms. &quot;I&#39;m so 
happy that I am able to meet my cousin,&quot; Lena said.

&quot;I&#39;m happy too,&quot; said Mia.

Just then, Mia let go of Lena. She was sensing something unusual and 
Arine had sensed it as well. &quot;What is it?&quot; asked Sam, seeing the change 
in expression on the elves&#39; faces.

Mia reached into her pocket and pulled out the Great Crystal of Alvara. 
It was glowing magenta. &quot;It&#39;s Johan,&quot; Mia sensed.

&quot;What does he want now?&quot; asked Sam.

Arine took the Crystal in her hands as well and said, &quot;I think he&#39;s 
leading us somewhere.&quot;

&quot;Where?&quot; asked Lena.

Mia and Arine held the Crystal in their hands, simply letting its pull 
guide them. They rotated the Crystal until they were aiming precisely in 
the direction it was pulling them. &quot;It&#39;s pulling us east,&quot; said Arine.

&quot;Arine,&quot; Mia said with a tone of mild surprise, &quot;I think he&#39;s in Japan.&quot;

&quot;Why would Johan be in Japan?&quot; Sam wondered.

Mia replied, &quot;I think there&#39;s only one way to find out.&quot;

----------

Ever since Lord Blake had had his attack and had fallen into his coma, 
Lord Odin had been in possession of the White Sapphire of the Mustanen 
Clan. However, after Johan fled the Jewel Summoner headquarters, he 
snuck back into the hideout that the Mustanen Clan had in the outskirts 
of Zurich, where Lord Odin and several other members of the Mustanen 
Clan had taken residence in waiting for Johan to return to Finland with 
them. With Odin asleep, Johan managed to take the White Sapphire without 
anyone noticing, after which he caught a flight to Osaka, Japan.

While on the flight, Johan had used the power of the Sapphire to alert 
every descendant of the elves to his location. As the plane landed in 
Osaka the next day, Johan sensed that elfin descendants were tracking 
the Sapphire, trying to find him, wondering why Johan had alerted them 
to where he was. Johan knew he had to act quickly before his people 
found him.

Johan hiked into the deep forest of Japan. He hiked for hours, trying as 
best he could to remember the path that he had taken twenty years 
before. Finally, he arrived at the location he was trying to get to: the 
ridge at the top of the waterfall where he had caught up with Erika 
Dagomar.

As Johan looked over the edge into the mist of the waterfall, he held up 
the White Sapphire and it started glowing white as he alerted his 
trackers to his location one last time. &quot;So much pain,&quot; he said to 
himself. &quot;So much suffering. So much death because of me. I was so 
blinded by vengeance and lust for power that I didn&#39;t see what the Jewel 
Summoners were trying to do for all these years. They were trying to 
help the elves. It&#39;s a small consolation, but there is only one thing 
that I can do to repay my debt to the Jewel Summoners.&quot;

Johan turned around so that his back was to the waterfall. With the 
glowing white Sapphire still in his hand, he spread his arms out just 
like Erika had done twenty years before. As Johan started leaning 
backwards, he spoke his final words, &quot;Come and find me.&quot; Johan let 
gravity pull him off of the ridge and into the mist of the waterfall 
below.

----------

Meanwhile, Mia and Arine were using the power of the Great Crystal of 
Alvara to track the piece of corundum that Johan had used to lure them 
to Japan. Every Jewel Summoner that could use the power of spinel was 
using the red crystals&#39; power to summon flying vehicles, which they were 
using to transport themselves and the elves to where they were sensing 
the power of Johan&#39;s corundum.

It was early morning when they reached Japan; the sky had barely started 
turning blue when they arrived. The Jewel Summoners simply landed their 
vehicles in the Yodo River, changing their shapes only slightly to 
resemble boats more closely than hovercraft. With their mission 
completed, they knew that they had no reason to hide their powers from 
the general public anymore, so they were able to land down in the river 
instead of some secluded area with no people around.

&quot;Why is Johan all the way out here?&quot; Sam wondered as the Jewel Summoners 
piloted them upstream.

&quot;This place is very familiar to me,&quot; said Mia. &quot;I think this is the 
river where Erika left me right after I was born.&quot;

With that question answered, Lena continued the conversation that they 
had started back in Zurich about the elves&#39; powers. &quot;How are the elves 
immortal?&quot; she asked. &quot;Which one of you possessed that gene?&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; Mia answered, &quot;it was not one specific gene. It was in fact 
a combination of two genes that makes elves immortal. As ironic as it 
may sound, the same gene that gave me my weak heart is necessary for 
immortality.&quot;

&quot;The gene not only causes changes in structure of the ears and the 
heart,&quot; said Arine, &quot;but it also changes the structure of the pituitary 
gland, which is a gland that produces many hormones, including growth 
hormone. This deformity of the pituitary gland causes the production of 
another hormone that doesn&#39;t even have a name yet.&quot;

&quot;However,&quot; Mia continued, &quot;that hormone had no effect on my body because 
I had no cellular receptors that reacted to that hormone.&quot;

&quot;I, however, did have that cellular receptor,&quot; said Arine. &quot;It&#39;s the 
final elfin gene that Johan found in me. The gene produces a cellular 
receptor that the hormone binds to. When the receptor detects the 
presence of the hormone, it creates a chemical inside the cell that 
activates a gene that is dormant in normal humans.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a gene that creates the enzyme known as telomerase,&quot; Mia finished.

&quot;Telomerase?&quot; Lena asked.

Mia explained, &quot;Whenever cells divide, their chromosomes lose a small 
bit of the tips. These tips are composed of genetic sequences known as 
telomeres. Because telomeres decrease in length very time a cell 
divides, there eventually comes a time when the telomeres are completely 
used up and the cell can no longer divide. Eventually, the cell dies.&quot;

&quot;However,&quot; Arine said, &quot;when the telomerase gene is activated, 
telomerase is produced, which lengthens telomeres. When that happens, 
cells can divide indefinitely, and a person would only age normally 
until they reach full maturity, at which time their aging stops. That&#39;s 
why the elves are immortal. It&#39;s the activation of telomerase caused by 
the deformation of the pituitary gland and by the cellular receptor gene 
that I carry.&quot; Just then the Great Crystal of Alvara started glowing 
magenta. &quot;It&#39;s close,&quot; Arine sensed. &quot;Whatever piece of corundum Johan 
was using, it&#39;s close.&quot;

As they drew closer to the White Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan, the 
Jewel Summoners saw a dim, white light coming from the early morning 
mist. &quot;Who goes there?&quot; Alana called out.

Whoever was holding the glowing object, having been alerted to their 
presence, approached the Jewel Summoners. It was a middle-aged man with 
blond hair, followed by others, most of them with a similar complexion. 
The man was holding a white sapphire, indicating that he was an 
descendant of the elves and that knew how to use his elfin powers. 
&quot;Jewel Summoners,&quot; he said upon seeing the glowing red boats that the 
group was sitting on. &quot;I am Odin Mustanen,&quot; he explained, &quot;caretaker of 
the Mustanen Clan.&quot;

&quot;Mustanen?&quot; said Giovanni. &quot;You&#39;re a relative of Johan,&quot; the elderly 
Jewel Summoner realized.

&quot;That is why we are here,&quot; Odin said. &quot;Johan took the White Sapphire of 
the Mustanen Clan from me while I slept. He then used the Sapphire to 
draw us here.&quot;

&quot;He did the same thing with us,&quot; said Mia.

Sensing that the Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan was close, Arine used the 
Crystal of Alvara to home in on its direction. The Crystal pointed 
directly toward a large patch of Manchurian wild rice that was growing 
on the shore of the river. Arine jumped out of the boat and into the 
river and started moving toward the patch of aquatic plants. Although 
the current was strong, her elfin strength gave her the ability to move 
through it with ease. As Arine made it to the wild rice patch, she 
started digging through the growth, looking for the White Sapphire.

After a moment of digging, Arine suddenly stopped. &quot;Oh, God,&quot; she said, 
looking at something in the patch.

Both the Jewel Summoners and the Mustanens went to Arine to see what she 
had found. It was the completely motionless body of Johan Mustanen. 
&quot;He&#39;s dead...&quot; said a dismayed Odin.

&quot;Johan drowns himself in the same river that Mia was born beside,&quot; Sam 
comprehended. &quot;Why?&quot;

As Sam spoke, Mia suddenly jumped from the boat, ran to the patch of 
rice, and started digging through it furiously. &quot;Mia?&quot; Arine asked. 
&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Arine could sense that Mia was extremely agitated 
and even a little distressed.

As the brunette frantically dug up the rice, clearing the patch by feet 
at a time, she suddenly stopped dead in her tracks and stared directly 
at what she had found. She staggered and then fell backward into the 
water, her face rife with both horror and sadness. &quot;Erika...&quot; she choked 
out. Everyone looked on and saw a body in the water. Indeed, it was the 
body of Erika Dagomar.

Fredrika then stepped into the water and went to her daughter&#39;s body. 
&quot;Johan must have jumped off the same waterfall that Erika did,&quot; she 
voiced her thought process. &quot;The river&#39;s flow brought him in exactly the 
same path that Erika took. He took the White Sapphire of the Mustanen 
Clan with him so that we had a way of finding his body. And because the 
river took him down the same path as Erika, if we found his body, we 
would find Erika&#39;s body as well.&quot; Fredrika took Erika&#39;s body in her arms 
and embraced it. Shedding tears, she said in no more than a whisper, &quot;My 
daughter...&quot;

----------

After everyone had recovered from the shock of finding the bodies of 
Johan and Erika in the river, they recovered the bodies and prepared for 
transporting them back to Scandinavia. Using the power of the Great 
Crystal of Alvara to commune with Erika and Olivia just as Johan had 
used the power of the white sapphire to commune with Rikhard, Mia and 
Arine learned that they all wanted to be laid to rest alongside Rikhard. 
Erika wanted to be with her husband, and Olivia wanted to be with her 
kin. The household of the Mustanen Clan was the best place for Rikhard, 
Erika, Olivia, and Johan to be memorialized. Olivia&#39;s body had been 
sealed in the vault of the Doulin Clan after the examination of her body 
revealed that she was a pureblooded elf. All that the Doulin Clan had to 
do was transport the body from Paris, France to Ivalo, Finland.

The spirits inside the Great Crystal told Mia and Arine that the only 
way their spirits could find peace is if they were released from the 
Crystal by coming in contact with their bodies. It was the girls&#39; first 
order of business to be carried out at the ceremony that was to be held 
in Ivalo. Johan, Olivia, and Erika were placed in that order next to 
Rikhard, each one at a right angle to the last, creating a four-spoked 
star with each body as one of the spokes.

As the Jewel Summoners and Mustanens congregated by the memorial, Odin 
walked in front of the memorial to address his subjects, the White 
Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan in his hand. &quot;Today,&quot; the Finn said, &quot;we 
lay to rest four most influential people whose lives changed the course 
of history. Rikhard Mustanen, loving and caring, father of Mia Carver. 
Johan Mustanen, Rikhard&#39;s twin brother, the most devoted person I have 
ever known. Erika Dagomar, loving wife of Rikhard, the only Jewel 
Summoner to be accepted into the Mustanen Clan, mother of Mia Carver. 
Olivia, daughter of Alvara, grandmother of Arine Sylven. At long last, 
you all can be at peace.&quot;

Odin moved aside, allowing Mia and Arine to approach the memorial. Arine 
stood in between Olivia and Erika while Mia stood in between Erika and 
Rikhard. Arine held the Great Crystal of Alvara over Olivia&#39;s body, 
preparing to release her grandmother&#39;s spirit. Both the Crystal and 
Olivia&#39;s body started glowing magenta. As the glowing continued, it 
slowly changed from a shade of magenta to a shade of red. At the same 
time, the Great Crystal decreased in size. When the glowing had stopped, 
the Great Crystal of Alvara had transformed back into the Red Ruby of 
Alvara! The Blue Sapphire element of the crystal had disappeared, 
carrying Olivia&#39;s spirit with it.

Arine handed the Ruby to Mia, who held it over Erika&#39;s body. In the same 
manner as before, both the Ruby and Erika&#39;s body started glowing red. 
Again, the shade of the glow changed, this time from red to white. When 
the glowing stopped, the crystal had again decreased in size and had 
become the white sapphire that Rikhard had when he was alive.

Finally, came Rikhard. Mia held the white sapphire over his body and 
released his father&#39;s spirit just as she had released her mother&#39;s. The 
sapphire and Rikhard&#39;s body glowed white. Slowly, as the sapphire 
reduced in size, its brightness decreased as well. Finally, as the white 
sapphire dissolved into nothingness, so did its white glow and Rikhard&#39;s 
spirit.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; said Mia with a bittersweet tone of voice. &quot;Their spirits 
have been released.&quot; she then looked at the four elves before her and 
said, &quot;All of you, thank you for what you have done.&quot;

Arine then said, &quot;Even you, Johan. You helped me discover my powers. The 
Prophecy of Awakening would not have come to pass without your 
guidance.&quot; The two pureblooded elves stepped away from the memorial and 
rejoined the congregation, holding each other for comfort.

Odin stepped back in front of the memorial and announced, &quot;As most of 
you already know, Lord Blake passed away last night. It was stated in 
his will I succeed him as leader of the Mustanen Clan. And as my first 
decree as leader of the Mustanen Clan, I hereby offer a truce between 
the elves and the Jewel Summoners. Will the leaders of the Jewel 
Summoner clans please step forward?&quot; Felix Doulin, Giovanni Valentino, 
Alana Lancestor, and Fredrika Dagomar walked up to Odin. &quot;Jewel 
Summoners,&quot; the new leader of the Mustanen Clan said, &quot;I hereby declare 
your debt to the elves...fulfilled.&quot;

At Lord Odin&#39;s declaration, everyone in the congregation cheered and 
whistled. Odin shook hands with the Clan Leaders of the Jewel Summoners, 
everyone smiling at the achievement that had taken 1500 long years to 
make.

----------

After spending the night at the Mustanen Clan household, Mia, Arine, 
Yvette, and the Jewel Summoners went to the Saariselk&auml; ski resort where 
they would depart for their respective places of residence.

&quot;Yvette,&quot; said Arine, shaking the Frenchwoman&#39;s hand, &quot;it was an honor 
to meet you.&quot;

&quot;The honor is mine,&quot; said Yvette. &quot;I got to see a secret world of magic 
and elves. A world I never would have dreamed of seeing.&quot; Her face then 
turned solemn. &quot;It will take some time to come to terms with Pierre&#39;s 
death,&quot; she said. &quot;But, I am sure I will in time.&quot;

&quot;I wish you happiness in life,&quot; Mia bid Yvette her farewell. The 
brunette then turned to Fredrika and said, &quot;I am happy that I was able 
to finally learn my true origins. Thank you for all your help...&quot; Mia 
trailed off, a little embarrassed by what she was about to address 
Fredrika as. Finally, she finished her sentence, addressing the leader 
of the Dagomar Clan as, &quot;...Grandmother.&quot;

Mia and Fredrika embraced each other, happy to have met each other. &quot;Be 
sure to visit your grandmother when you have the chance,&quot; said Fredrika.

&quot;I will,&quot; replied Mia. After Mia spent a tender moment with her 
grandmother, she and Arine turned to Sam, who was standing next to Lena. 
&quot;Leaving me again, Sam?&quot; Mia asked, mocking the fear that she had felt 
of losing Sam when he had moved away to New York 8 years before.

&quot;No,&quot; the boy replied. &quot;Never again. I&#39;m just going to spend some time 
is Stockholm with the Dagomars. But I promise I&#39;ll come back for you.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Arine asked, &quot;you two are seeing each other now?&quot;

&quot;With all of my training as a Jewel Summoner,&quot; Lena explained, &quot;I didn&#39;t 
get to meet very many boys. However, now that I&#39;ve achieved the rank of 
Madame, I don&#39;t have to train all the time to become a valued member of 
the Dagomar Clan. Now I have time to do the things that really matter. 
Sam was obviously very kind to you and Mia, and I am sure he will be 
kind to me as well.&quot;

&quot;Well, Sam,&quot; said Mia with a smile on her face. &quot;It seems you got your 
beautiful, brown-haired girlfriend after all.&quot;

Sam chuckled at Mia&#39;s remark, remembering how he had been in love with 
Mia just the week before. &quot;I guess I did,&quot; he said. The four teens 
embraced each other, physically confirming the relationships that they 
had through each other by emotions, and in the case of Mia and Lena, by 
blood as well.

After they had parted, Mia and Arine joined David and Julia, who had 
recently achieved the ranks of Lord and Lady. Now able to use the power 
of spinel, they were to be the elves&#39; transport back to the United 
States.

&quot;Take care of that girl, Son,&quot; said David as he and his wife summoned a 
crystal vehicle.

&quot;I will,&quot; Sam said to his father. After Mia, Arine, David, and Julia had 
boarded the vehicle, the two Jewel Summoners piloted the vehicle up into 
the air and aimed southwest, back toward New York.

----------

Arine was reunited with her parents at Oceanside airport, and Mia was 
reunited with her adoptive parents as well. As Mr. and Mrs. Lancestor 
took their leave, the girls&#39; parents drove them back to their dorm. And 
on the way, the girls told their parents as best they could about the 
events that had transpired over the past few weeks. &quot;Fascinating,&quot; said 
Arine&#39;s father as they entered room #335 of the Oceanside Academy 
dormitory. &quot;Truly fascinating.&quot;

&quot;Do you really believe in this talk of elves and Jewel Summoners?&quot; 
Arine&#39;s mother asked him.

&quot;After all of those people all over the world glowing red and blue, 
including me,&quot; said Avery Sylven, &quot;I&#39;ll believe just about anything.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Mia&#39;s mother, &quot;these girls must be tired after their 
adventure across the world. Maybe we should let them rest?&quot;

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Mia&#39;s father said.

&quot;We&#39;ll be staying at a nearby hotel,&quot; said Avery. &quot;We&#39;ll see you 
tomorrow, okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay, Dad,&quot; Arine responded.

As the girls&#39; parents left the room, the girls slipped out of their 
shoes and threw themselves down onto Mia&#39;s bed, Arine draping her right 
arm over the brunette&#39;s body. &quot;I&#39;m so glad that you&#39;re here with me, 
Mia,&quot; the blonde said. &quot;I&#39;m so glad that you don&#39;t have to suffer from 
your weak heart any longer.&quot;

&quot;Arine...&quot; Mia said. The two girls looked into each other&#39;s eyes and Mia 
continued speaking, &quot;...are you still having those dreams about me?&quot;

Arine&#39;s eyes widened at her girlfriend&#39;s question. &quot;Mia?&quot; she asked as 
if inquiring as to whether or not the brunette was saying what Arine 
thought she was saying. Mia simply nodded. Both girls smiled lovingly at 
each other, tears of joy coming to their eyes.

Finally, with Mia&#39;s heart condition a thing of the past, Arine could do 
what she had been dreaming of ever since they had left for Zurich. Mia 
and Arine wrapped their arms around each other, kissing passionately, 
now not having to hold anything back from each other. Mia reached for 
Arine&#39;s right breast and started fondling it, causing the blonde to moan 
into her mouth.

Arine could feel her nipples press against the fabric of her shirt. Mia 
reached to the hem of Arine&#39;s shirt and pulled it off. She then 
unclasped Arine&#39;s bra, releasing the pressure that the garment was 
putting on the blonde&#39;s swollen breasts. Mia kissed Arine&#39;s bare 
breasts, eliciting small moans from the blonde&#39;s mouth. &quot;Oh, Mia,&quot; 
moaned the blonde. &quot;That feels so good.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting so long to do this,&quot; cooed Mia. Arine gasped when she 
felt Mia licking and sucking on her erect nipples.

Mia gently pushed Arine onto her back and went back to kissing her lips. 
Arine, wanting to feel Mia&#39;s warm flesh, pulled the brunette&#39;s shirt 
off, after which Mia took off her own bra, exposing her larger breasts 
to Arine. Not missing a beat, Mia went back to kissing Arine as soon as 
her slightly fuller breasts were exposed. Mia pressed herself into 
Arine, driving her own erect nipples into Arine&#39;s. Both girls moaned in 
bliss as their nipples were stimulated by the other girl&#39;s nipples. &quot;I 
love the feel of your body,&quot; the shorter girl moaned.

Mia got up from Arine&#39;s body and straddled the blonde. The brunette had 
a mischievous smile on her face that turned Arine on even more. Mia 
unbuttoned and unzipped her pants, pulling them off her legs. Mia&#39;s wet 
womanhood was just as beautiful as in Arine&#39;s dream.

As Mia went back to kissing Arine, Arine reached around the smaller 
girl&#39;s body and grasped Mia&#39;s buttocks. Mia moaned at the contact and 
then started laughing as they kissed. Mia started moving down Arine&#39;s 
body, kissing her chin, her neck, her collarbone, her cleavage. As she 
started stimulating Arine&#39;s breasts with her mouth, Mia unzipped Arine&#39;s 
pants and snuck her right hand into Arine&#39;s nether region. &quot;It&#39;s just 
like in my dream,&quot; Arine said. &quot;It was a premonition, a vision of what 
was to come.&quot; Arine moaned loudly as Mia started stimulating the 
blonde&#39;s sex.

Mia continued her way down Arine&#39;s body until her face was between 
Arine&#39;s legs. Mia took off Arine&#39;s pants, revealing the blonde&#39;s aroused 
vulva. Arine was dripping with desire. Mia looked up one more time at 
Arine&#39;s face. &quot;Are you ready, Arine?&quot; Mia asked her lover. Arine looked 
down at Mia and nodded in compliance. With Arine giving permission to 
continue, Mia took a hold on Arine&#39;s hips and brought her face down into 
Arine&#39;s mound.

&quot;Oh! Oh, Mia!&quot; Arine moaned as she felt Mia&#39;s tongue work wonders on her 
most sensitive spot. &quot;Mia,&quot; she continued moaning. &quot;It feels so good.&quot;

Mia stopped her ministrations just long enough to say to her lover, &quot;I&#39;m 
so happy we can be together like this,&quot; and then went back to pleasuring 
her lover, causing Arine to moan in bliss.

&quot;Me too,&quot; said Arine, so happy that her dreams about being able to make 
love to Mia were coming true. The blonde played with her own breasts as 
Mia licked up and down her slit. Mia slipped her tongue into the 
blonde&#39;s canal and Arine started rocking her hips to her lover&#39;s 
ministrations, shoving Mia&#39;s tongue in and out of her hole.

As Arine felt her orgasm starting to build within her, she started 
thrusting her hips into Mia&#39;s face harder. Obviously noticing Arine&#39;s 
urgency, Mia started going down on Arine faster, swirling her tongue and 
lips all around Arine&#39;s vulva. &quot;Mia,&quot; Arine pleaded, &quot;I&#39;m so close. 
Don&#39;t stop.&quot; Arine gripped the bed sheets to keep from pushing herself 
away from Mia&#39;s gifted mouth. The blonde clenched her teeth as she 
reached her peak, trying to hold back as long as possible. As soon as 
Mia&#39;s tongue started flicking Arine&#39;s erect clitoris, the blonde was 
rocked by a powerful orgasm. Her back arched and her body convulsed. Not 
wanting to hold anything back, Arine cried out in ecstasy as her orgasm 
rushed through her young body, not trying nor intending to muffle her 
orgasmic cries.

The blonde came down from her orgasm and her body went limp. She 
breathed heavily, basking in the blissful aftermath of her climax. Mia 
looked at her satisfied girlfriend and softly said to her, &quot;I love you, 
Arine. I love you so much. I&#39;m so happy that we can do this together.&quot;

Arine slowly opened her eyes to see a very happy Mia looking up at her 
lovingly. Being with Mia like this was similar to her dream in so many 
ways, but Arine noticed that there was a difference between the dream 
and reality. In the dream, neither Mia nor Arine spoke. They didn&#39;t say 
anything to each other at all. All that Arine cared about in the dream 
was the sex. In the real world, Mia and Arine had actually spoken to 
each other, expressing words of love and compassion. Sex was no longer 
all that it was about. Love was there too! The existence of any emotion 
of any kind let Arine know that this was not the dream that she had had. 
It was real! She was actually there and she was actually being intimate 
with the one person that she loved more than anything else in the world.

&quot;That felt so good, Mia,&quot; said Arine. &quot;And I want to return the favor.&quot;

Now possessing the stamina of an elf, Arine recovered quickly and was 
ready to make Mia feel good, just as she had done for Arine. The two 
girls leaned toward each other and kissed, wrapping their arms around 
each other&#39;s bodies.

Arine moved her right hand to the brunette&#39;s front and grabbed her 
lover&#39;s left breast. Mia moaned in pleasure as Arine played with her 
breast. Arine pressed herself into Mia and kissed her, slipping her 
tongue into the brunette&#39;s mouth. Mia sucked playfully at Arine&#39;s tongue 
as her hands found Arine&#39;s breasts, stroking and caressing the soft 
mounds that protruded from the blonde&#39;s chest.

Without breaking their lip-lock, Arine pushed Mia down onto the bed and 
lay on top of the shorter girl. She slid her hand between the brunette&#39;s 
legs, feeling the soft warmth of her friend&#39;s mound. She moved her 
fingers across Mia&#39;s slit, feeling how moist it was. Arine pressed her 
hand against Mia&#39;s wet folds, causing the brunette to moan loudly in 
pleasure.

&quot;I&#39;m so happy that we can finally be together like we&#39;ve always wanted,&quot; 
sighed Mia as Arine fingered her vulva. Mia and Arine rolled onto their 
sides so that Mia was lying on her left side and Arine was lying on her 
right. The two women locked their lips together again, savoring every 
sweet lick from each other&#39;s mouths. They wrapped their arms and legs 
around each other, pulling their bodies close to each other. Arine felt 
Mia&#39;s soft breasts pressing against her chest, their nipples lightly 
brushing together.

Mia turned around in Arine&#39;s arms, facing away from the blonde, allowing 
the taller girl access to her front side. Arine suckled on the side of 
Mia&#39;s neck, causing Mia to moan in delight. &quot;Mm,&quot; Mia sighed. &quot;That 
feels nice. Your body is so warm, Arine.&quot; Arine brought her right hand 
to Mia&#39;s right breast and squeezed it gently. Mia moaned in rapture as 
Arine held her nipple in between her thumb and index finger. Arine 
pulled on the erect nub with her right hand as her left hand wandered 
down Mia&#39;s body into the darkness of the brunette&#39;s nether regions. Mia 
moaned loudly as Arine started fingering her wet womanhood. Loving the 
sound of Mia&#39;s heavenly voice rife with passion, Arine dipped her 
fingers into her lover&#39;s soft folds, eliciting more aroused cries from 
the brunette&#39;s throat. &quot;Oh, Arine!&quot; Mia cried.

&quot;Mia,&quot; sighed Arine. &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful. You body is just as warm and 
soft as I imagined. I&#39;m so happy.&quot;

Mia rocked her hips desperately, driving her cleft against the palm of 
Arine&#39;s left hand. Seeing that Mia was on the verge, Arine sped up her 
ministrations, pushing her fingers deep into Mia&#39;s dripping sex. 
&quot;Arine!&quot; Mia cried as she approached her climax. The brunette moaned 
over and over again with each of Arine&#39;s thrusts into her canal. The 
pitch and volume of her moans escalated as she reached her peak.

&quot;I&#39;m so happy that I can finally make you feel good,&quot; said Arine, her 
voice so full of love. &quot;You don&#39;t have to live without pleasure ever 
again.&quot;

&quot;Arine! Arine!&quot; Mia cried over and over again as her body seized up. 
Then, Arine felt the walls of Mia&#39;s vagina crush her fingers as a 
deafening &quot;ARIIIIIINE!!!&quot; escaped from Mia&#39;s lungs. The blonde could 
feel her lover&#39;s juices flowing from her opening, covering her hand in 
warm wetness.

As the last of Mia&#39;s spasms died down and she fell limp on the bed, 
Arine simply wraped her arms around the brunette and pulled her close. 
The fact that Mia was panting heavily let Arine know that Mia&#39;s orgasm 
had NOT brought on an attack, and it filled the blonde&#39;s heart with so 
much satisfaction that she was finally able to consummate her love 
without killing her beloved.

After a moment of recovery, Mia slowly opened her eyes. Her senses 
returning to her, Mia felt that her body was wrapped in something soft, 
smooth, and warm. She realized that it was a person&#39;s body. &quot;Arine?&quot; she 
asked. The two girls looked into each other&#39;s eyes and Mia asked, &quot;Am I 
alive?&quot;

Arine smiled at Mia and, with tears of joy in her eyes, answered, &quot;Yes, 
Mia. You&#39;re alive.&quot;

Mia turned around in Arine&#39;s arms, facing her lover. Tears forming in 
the corners of her eyes as well, Mia wrapped her arms around Arine and 
kissed her passionately. They could no longer contain the intense, 
joyous emotions that filled their hearts and the tears of joy gushed 
forth from their eyes. They embraced each other tightly, holding onto 
each other as if the world was about to end. &quot;Thank you! Thank you! 
Thank you!&quot; Mia cried over and over again in between kisses.

Not wanting to part her lips with Mia&#39;s, Arine communicated to Mia 
through her thoughts alone, &#39;I love you, Mia. I&#39;ll never let you go.&#39;

&#39;I love you, Arine,&#39; Mia communicated in a similar fashion. &#39;I&#39;ll never 
let you go.&#39;

----------

As the people of the world inquired about the blue and red lights that 
had burst forth from hundreds of people, word came to them about two 
elves whose powers had awakened the dormant elfin genes in their DNA. 
Several pregnant women gave birth to children with pointed ears who 
developed unusual powers, such as empathy and ability to sense the 
future, as they grew older. By the time Mia Lancestor, daughter of 
Samual Lancestor and Lena Dagomar, was born, hundreds of pureblooded 
elfin children had been born. Many people who had seen the Jewel 
Summoners pilot their vehicles asked how they were able to use those 
powers, and the Jewel Summoners taught them about their abilities and 
how they could use similar abilities as well.

Mia and Arine, with all the time they wanted to explore the world, did 
just that. After college, they visited Japan, just as Mia had planned. 
And even after visiting Japan, they continued exploring the world.  They 
both stopped aging at the age of 22, remaining youthful for decades 
afterward. And by the time Mia and Arine wished each other Happy New 
Century on New Year&#39;s day, 2100, Arine&#39;s ears had grown the points of 
the pureblooded elves. And the love that Mia and Arine shared never 
diminished at all.</pre>
