<a href="../mascots/togetherness-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&#39;Athas flew into the library to talk a bit with Mia while Arine was 
away. Looking around, the ancient fairy became worried. Not only was the 
elf gone, but it looked like she left in haste and she took her 
shillelagh. &#39;Athas was about to look around for clues when she noticed 
the runes scattered on the coffee table. After glancing at them 
momentarily, she very quickly turned back to the window and let out a 
high-pitched whistle. A few seconds later, the squirrel from earlier had 
joined her.

&quot;Maire,&quot; the fairy said, &quot;Take a look at these stones will ye.&quot;

The animal turned and quickly looked at them, her nose sniffing at the 
rune stones and her tail twitching wildly.

&quot;Th&#39; warrior.&quot; the squirrel said out loud in human speech as she looked 
at one stone with a rune that resembled an arrow, &quot;Constraint,&quot; she said 
glancing at the vertical line intersected by an angular one, &quot;Love&quot;, she 
said referring to the image of two angles intersecting, &quot;And 
disruption.&quot; she finished as she looked at the last rune, two vertical 
lines connected by an angular one. Suddenly the creature put two and two 
together and looked back to &#39;Athas.

&quot;Her ladyship&#39;s young lass.&quot; Maire said, her voice betraying a sudden 
anxiety, &quot;She be in danger.&quot;

&quot;Aye, true enough it &#39;tis,&quot; the elder answered, &quot;And t&#39;would appear the 
missus has gone out to &#39;elp her. But she may be needin&#39; help now. Can ye 
try to find th&#39; lass?&quot;

Maire closed her eyes as her tail suddenly stuck straight up and her 
ears picked up. After a moment or two, she opened her eyes again. 
Turning away from &#39;Athas, she leapt off the table, her fur transforming 
into feathers as her form shifted into that of an eagle. As the elder 
fairy watched her fly out the window, she swallowed hard.

&quot;Go, gentle pooka.&quot; she whispered, &quot;Go, and &#39;elp th&#39; mistress and th&#39; 
wee lass.

------

&quot;You say you&#39;re a friend of hers from Ireland?&quot; Arine asked as she sat 
in her rented apartment across from Donovan O&#39;Brian, her laptop resting 
on a tray in front of her, &quot;Funny she didn&#39;t mention anything about 
you.&quot;

&quot;Well now, not so much a friend as an acquaintance.&quot; the Irishman 
corrected her, &quot;Ye see, our families go quite a ways back. And anyways, 
I very much doubt she would&#39;ve mentioned anything about me.&quot; O&#39;Brian 
said as he pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose, &quot;After all, you 
were interviewing her about a book, not about her friends and 
acquaintances from the homeland.&quot;

&quot;True enough.&quot; she said, &quot;But if you&#39;re an old acquaintance of Mia&#39;s, 
why would you seek me out? From what you said, you were looking for me 
at the publishing house of Amazing Fantasy, right?&quot;

&quot;Well, ye see,&quot; O&#39;Brian said as he rose from his seat and began to pace 
around the room, &quot;I wasn&#39;t sure, but I thought you might be interested 
in learning a bit about her from someone else as well, give yer article 
a bit more depth maybe. Also, I was on my way to visit Miss Shea when I 
lost her address. &#39;Tis an embarrassing thing to admit, but I don&#39;t know 
how to get in touch with her any more. I first went to her publisher, 
but they couldn&#39;t give out her address, and...&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Arine said as she turned to the bearded Irishman, &quot;Well Mr... 
O&#39;Brian is it? Mr. O&#39;Brian, I would dearly love to hear any stories you 
might have about Mia.&quot; she said, smiling wistfully to herself as she 
thought once again of her time in the elf&#39;s cottage, &quot;But I can&#39;t give 
out her home address to someone I just met, not without her permission.&quot;

Donovan narrowed his eyes, &quot;What?&quot; he asked, trying to hold in his 
anger.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you understand,&quot; the reporter said, &quot;Miss Shea is a very 
private woman, and while I don&#39;t want you to think I don&#39;t believe you, 
I also have to be respectful of her privacy.

&quot;I see.&quot; the Irishman murmured as he began to make his way to the 
apartment door.

&quot;If you&#39;re going to be in the city for a while though,&quot; Arine added, 
&quot;I&#39;d love to hear any stories you could share about her, and I promise 
to talk with her the next time I see her. But now if you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;m 
going to have to ask you to leave. I have an article to write, and I 
have to take a shower, so...&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m sorry it had t&#39; come to this,&quot; Donovan said as he locked the 
door. He then turned to the blonde as he held his shillelagh with both 
hands, &quot;But I&#39;m not going anywhere...&quot;

------

Mia watched the skyscrapers slowly pass by as the bus driver at last 
announced her stop. The elf was trembling, trying not to imagine the 
worst as the vehicle finally came to a stop and she rushed off with her 
shillelagh. As she began to hail a cab, something went through her. It 
was like a wave of pure fear and anxiety, and for a moment she felt 
almost faint. Catching her breath, she realized that whatever danger the 
rune stones had spoken of was now manifesting.

As a cab finally stopped for her, she got in and gave the directions to 
the hotel Arine was staying at, clutching her shillelagh tightly as she 
did so.

------

Arine felt a sudden tinge of unease at the way the Irishman&#39;s tone 
changed, &quot;Wha... Look, I&#39;m sorry, but I now have to demand you leave.&quot;

O&#39;Brian didn&#39;t answer her; instead, he raised his stick high above his 
head. Arine let out a short cry as she fell backward in her chair as the 
Irishman brought his stick down on her computer, smashing it. She landed 
hard, her back aching as she crawled away and got back to her feet.

&quot;What in the hell are you doing?&quot; she demanded as she winced from the 
pain to her back, &quot;Are you nuts?&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; O&#39;Brian growled, &quot;Her address. Give me Shea&#39;s address or...&quot;

Arine began to panic; this man in the room with her was obviously some 
sort of obsessed stalker of Mia&#39;s. She made a run for the phone to call 
for help, but Donovan reached the phone first, using his shillelagh to 
knock it against the far wall.

The blonde began to hyperventilate. Nothing like this had ever happened 
to her before, and she had no idea what to do. In desperation she ran 
for the window, hoping to escape down the fire escape. She only managed 
to open the window a crack before the Irishman&#39;s vice-like grip yanked 
her painfully away by the arm. She yelped out in pain as he flung her to 
the ground.

&quot;No...&quot; she said as she held her bruised arm, &quot;Don&#39;t, please...&quot;

&quot;Where is she?&quot; O&#39;Brian bellowed, &quot;Where is the heathen elfin whore? 
Tell me or I&#39;ll break yer bleedin&#39; arms!&quot;

The reporter was too scared to even think straight. She cowered in the 
corner of the room holding her arm as Donovan waved his stick in front 
of her. As she desperately tried to come up with some sort of a plan, 
both she and O&#39;Brian heard someone knock at the door. O&#39;Brian 
momentarily turned his attention away from the blonde as the lock to the 
door suddenly started turning by itself. A second later, it flew open as 
a brunette rushed in holding a stick looking very similar to that of the 
Irishman&#39;s.

Arine&#39;s heart soared as she saw Mia staring down the Irishman. She 
couldn&#39;t explain why, but somehow seeing her lover gave her confidence, 
and in some inexplicable way she knew she was going to be okay.

Mia looked from her beloved trembling fearfully in the corner to the 
brute standing threateningly over her, and frowned as she held her 
shillelagh in a one-handed fighting stance, wishing she was wearing a 
good pair of sneakers instead of the black pumps she had on.

&quot;Get away from her.&quot; she snarled, &quot;Now!&quot;

O&#39;Brian smirked as he looked at the brunette, &quot;Yer scarf does nothin&#39; to 
hide yer ears, ye pagan trollop.&quot; he said as he started to step away 
from the blonde, &quot;&#39;Tis you, isn&#39;t it Shea?&quot;

Mia frowned, &quot;And who might I be talking to?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Donovan,&quot; the man answered, &quot;Donovan O&#39;Brian.&quot;

&quot;O&#39;Brian!&quot; Mia said, &quot;So that&#39;s what this is all about. Your clan hasn&#39;t 
changed a bit I see. Still attacking unarmed women, eh?&quot;

&quot;Shet yer bleedin&#39; mouth!&quot; O&#39;Brian yelled, &quot;Tell me where your kin folk 
are, and...&quot;

&quot;I have no kin.&quot; Mia answered.

Donovan&#39;s face fell a bit, &quot;What?&quot; he asked incredulously, &quot;What do ye 
mean ye have no kin?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m the last Shea.&quot; The brunette answered, noticing the Irishman was 
still lingering around the fearful form of Arine. &quot;O&#39;Brian, listen to 
me.&quot; she said sternly, &quot;The feud&#39;s over. Your side won. I&#39;m the last, 
there are no more.&quot;

Donovan stared at her in disbelief as she continued.

&quot;There is no honor in killing a lone woman. Whatever has happened 
between our clans in the past, let it stay in the past. I&#39;ve no qualm 
with you or your family; I simply wish to live out my life in peace.&quot;

As Arine slowly began to stand up in the corner, Donovan stared 
emotionlessly for a long time at the elf standing before him. Slowly, he 
scowled at her.

&quot;My side won, eh?&quot; he said, &quot;Nay, as long as you or any other elf lives 
I...&quot; O&#39;Brian was cut off as a large eagle flew into the room through 
the window Arine had cracked open. She landed between the blond reporter 
and the Irishman, suddenly transforming herself into a large black goat 
as she did so, her eyes glowing yellow.

Arine gasped in shock. She looked from the thing in front of her to Mia, 
only to see the elf give her a look of reassurance.

Donovan meanwhile seemed beside himself, &quot;A pooka!&quot; he gasped as he 
suddenly crossed himself. The creature began to advance on him as he 
began to back away fearfully.

&quot;Ye&#39;ve hurt milady&#39;s wee lass.&quot; the creature hissed angrily, 
&quot;Marbhfh&#39;aisc ort!&quot;

Arine then realized that, somehow, the goat-thing was on her side. As 
she watched, O&#39;Brian began to become the fearful one.

&quot;Pater noster,&quot; the Irishman said as he reached into his pocket and 
pulled out a small Rosary, &quot;Que es in caelis...&quot; he mumbled as he backed 
away from the pooka.

&quot;M&#39;uchadh is b&#39;a ort!&quot; Maire exclaimed as she began kicking at the floor 
as if preparing to charge.

Donovan looked from the pooka to Mia, and grudgingly began to move 
toward the door.

&quot;Ye filthy heathen,&quot; he growled, &quot;Yer lucky the damned fiend showed when 
it did.&quot;

&quot;O&#39;Brian.&quot; Mia said as he reached the door, &quot;You&#39;d be surprised by just 
what kind of friends I do have. And let me warn you; this isn&#39;t 
nineteenth-century Ireland. You&#39;ve attacked a woman with a weapon in 
front of witnesses. Try anything of this sort again, and I&#39;ll have the 
authorities on you.&quot;

&quot;Authorities?&quot; the Irishman asked sarcastically, &quot;Ha! Sooner or later 
ye&#39;ll be alone, without yer pooka and without any way out, then I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Go n-ithe an cat th&#39;u,&quot; the goat shrieked, &quot;is go n-ithe an diabhal an 
cat!&quot;

All the color drained from O&#39;Brian&#39;s face. He crossed himself again as 
he glared at Maire and left. Mia quickly locked the door and rushed to 
Arine, taking her into her arms as the blonde began to cry. Maire 
changed her shape once more into that of a squirrel and scurried over.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; she asked, &quot;Is the blue-eyed fair one alright?&quot;

&quot;Aye Maire.&quot; Mia answered as she ran her hand back and forth down the 
writer&#39;s back, &quot;She&#39;s a bit shaken, but she&#39;ll be okay. You circle 
around the building and make sure that mongrel O&#39;Brien is gone, and then 
head back to the cottage.&quot;

Maire nodded, her fur once again transforming itself into feathers as 
she flew out the window. Mia watched her leave, then turned her 
attention back to Arine.

&quot;Shhh...&quot; she whispered, &quot;It&#39;s okay now. He&#39;s gone.&quot;

Arine looked into Mia&#39;s kind brown eyes, &quot;What...&quot; Arine struggled to 
articulate her words, &quot;What was all that about? My god, what...&quot;

&quot;An old family grudge going back several generations.&quot; Mia explained as 
she continued to rub the blonde&#39;s back, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I thought it was 
over long ago, and I certainly never meant for you to get involved in 
any of this.&quot; she said adding, &quot;My goodness, we&#39;ve both been crying like 
old women today, haven&#39;t we?&quot;

Arine began to chuckle in spite of herself, calming down as Mia held 
her, &quot;I knew...&quot; she began, &quot;Somehow, when I saw you storm in here, I 
knew I&#39;d be safe.&quot;

Mia smiled at that. She kissed the blonde&#39;s forehead. Arine for her part 
enjoyed the feeling of the elf&#39;s arms once again holding her close, 
especially after the ordeal she&#39;d just been through.

&quot;Oh Mia, it was awful.&quot; Arine whispered, &quot;I... That goat thing?&quot; Arine 
thought to ask, &quot;The one that turned into a bird. What was it?&quot;

&quot;She was the squirrel we were having tea with earlier.&quot; Mia answered, 
&quot;Her name&#39;s Maire, and she&#39;s a pooka.&quot;
&quot;A pooka?&quot; the blonde asked. Mia nodded her head as she stroked the 
taller young woman&#39;s back.

&quot;A solitary fairy,&quot; the brunette explained, &quot;They&#39;re changelings. I 
suppose you&#39;d say they&#39;re a sort of fairy shaman.&quot; Mia then put her 
finger under Arine&#39;s chin, tilting her head up, &quot;Are you feeling 
better?&quot;

Arine nodded, &quot;All...&quot; she began, &quot;All I wanted to do was take a shower 
and write my article, and that creep...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right now love.&quot; Mia said. Looking around the apartment, she 
asked, &quot;Where is the bathroom anyways?&quot;

&quot;Over there.&quot; Arine said, pointing to a door in the small hallway, 
&quot;But... But I don&#39;t want to be alone, not right now, I....&quot; she stopped 
when Mia put two fingers to her lips. She then began to lead her back 
towards the bathroom. She pulled Arine in, shut the door behind her, and 
began to undo the buttons on the blonde&#39;s blouse.

&quot;There, there love.&quot; Mia cooed, &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry. I&#39;ll help you 
now.&quot;

Arine was a bit surprised at first, but was grateful nonetheless that 
she wasn&#39;t alone. Slowly her anxiety began to subside as Mia removed her 
blouse like she was some sort of child incapable of undressing herself.

&quot;My computer.&quot; she mumbled as the elf unbuttoned her pants.

&quot;Don&#39;t fret.&quot; Mia said as she unzipped the reporter&#39;s fly, &quot;We were 
going to get back together tonight anyways, remember? You can write your 
article on my computer.&quot;

&quot;Mia?&quot; the blonde now asked, &quot;How did you know I was in danger?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m an elf, love.&quot; Mia said as she pulled Arine&#39;s pants down, &quot;We have 
our ways.&quot;

As Arine placed her hands on the author&#39;s shoulders and proceeded to 
step out of her trousers, she realized that she was becoming aroused by 
Mia&#39;s attention, and she breathed deeply as the elf then rose up to 
unclasp her bra. She removed the bra and went to pull Arine&#39;s panties 
off, stopping when she noticed they were a bit damp. She looked up at 
the blonde and smirked.

&quot;You&#39;re enjoying this, aren&#39;t you?&quot; she asked. Arine blushed as she 
stood naked before Mia. The elf then stood up and began to undress as 
well, removing her dress and sweater as she kicked off her shoes. She 
bent over to unhook her stockings from her garter belt when she heard an 
appreciative moan coming behind her. She chuckled a bit as she finally 
took her undergarments off and grabbed the soap, shampoo and a 
washcloth. She then gently led Arine into the shower.

Under the warm water, the blonde closed her eyes as she felt the 
washcloth in Mia&#39;s hand begin to lather up her back. Mia then turned her 
around and wrapped an arm around her waist, pulling her so that her back 
was pressed up against the brunette&#39;s chest. As the washcloth began to 
lather Arine&#39;s front, the elf&#39;s other arm held her close.

&quot;There now.&quot; Mia purred as she kissed Arine&#39;s neck, &quot;Feeling better?&quot;

Under Mia&#39;s gentle hands Arine felt all the tension release from her 
body. She managed to nod her head in response. The brunette held her 
tighter.

&quot;You&#39;re safe now, my love.&quot; she said as she tossed the washcloth behind 
her, slowly rubbing her soft hands over the reporter&#39;s front to rinse 
away the soap. She then turned Arine toward her, allowing the water to 
wash away the soap from her back. As she held Arine close, their breasts 
rubbed up against one another. Arine, unable to hold back anymore, 
pulled Mia into a kiss. They held onto each other as the water flowed 
over their naked flesh, their tongues exploring their mouths as the 
blonde ran her fingers through the elf&#39;s damp hair.

&quot;Mmmm...&quot; the elf sighed as she pulled away, &quot;Stand back just a minute 
love.&quot;

Arine pouted, but did as she was told. Mia grabbed the bottle of shampoo 
and squirted some out onto her hand. She then began to work in into the 
blonde&#39;s wet locks. Turning the reporter so that her head was once again 
under the water, she ran her fingers through her lover&#39;s hair as she 
rinsed the water out. She then turned the water off, and grabbed a towel 
for herself and Arine. As she was drying her hair, the elf felt Arine&#39;s 
hands come up from behind to rest on her breasts.

Arine heard Mia gasp out in a combination of surprise and pleasure, and 
smiled. As she held the elf close, holding her breasts in her hands as 
she gently massaged the still damp flesh in the steam-filled bathroom, 
she brought her lips up to her left ear.

&quot;You know,&quot; Arine whispered, &quot;Seeing as how my computer&#39;s broken, and 
seeing as how the evening busses won&#39;t start to leave until around five, 
that gives us two hours.&quot; she said as she began to rub Mia&#39;s nipples 
between her thumb and index fingers, &quot;What do you think we should do 
until then?&quot; she asked as she brought her lips to the elf&#39;s earlobe, 
sucking on it gently.

Mia moaned deeply as she felt her knees growing weak. She turned and 
once again brought her mouth to Arine&#39;s, the heat within her rising even 
as she brought her hands up behind the blonde&#39;s back. After several 
moments passed, Mia pulled back, taking the reporter&#39;s hand in hers as 
she led her out of the bathroom and into the other room where the bed 
was.

End Notes: There are two main types of fairies; the trooping fairies, 
who live in groups, and the solitary fairies. Among the solitary fairies 
are the cobbler fairies known as the leprechauns, the banshees, whose 
plaintive cries outside a dwelling announce the death of a family 
member, and of course the pooka, a fairy who can change their form at 
will into that of almost any animal, but who is most usually described 
in the guise of either an eagle, a black goat, or a horse with yellow 
eyes.

Americans will probably be most familiar with the pooka from the Jimmy 
Stewart comedic film Harvey, in which a pooka who&#39;s described as an 
invisible six-foot tall rabbit follows Stewart&#39;s character around 
throughout the film.

The words the pooka were uttering were all Irish curses.

&quot;Marbhfh&#39;aisc ort!&quot; is a curse which translates to &quot;A (burial) shroud on 
you.&quot;

&quot;M&#39;uchadh is b&#39;a ort!&quot; means &quot;Smothering and drowning on you.&quot;

&quot;Go n-ithe an cat th&#39;u, is go n-ithe an diabhal an cat!&quot; means &quot;May the 
cat eat you, and may the devil eat your cat!&quot;

Finally, when O&#39;Brian pulls out his Rosary, he begins to speak not in 
Irish Gaelic, but in the Latin of the Catholic Church. &quot;Pater noster que 
es in caelis&quot; translates to &quot;Our father who art in heaven.&quot;</pre>
