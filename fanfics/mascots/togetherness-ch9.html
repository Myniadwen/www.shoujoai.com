<h1>Togetherness (part 9 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mascots/togetherness-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>After Gemma and her great granddaughter left, the evening became filled 
with the music of the Irish uillian bagbipe and old folk tales told by 
Mia and the golden-haired fairy Eriu. Arine was treated to stories of 
how brave Conchobor won the kingship of Ulster, the story of the 
children of Lir who were turned into magical white swans by their evil 
stepmother, and of the ongoing war between the oak king and the holly 
king who fight for supremacy every winter and summer solstice.

Arine was spellbound by the tales, and yet at the same time was a bit 
disappointed; neither the elf nor the beautiful little fairy talked of 
the real-life conflict between the Shea and the O&#39;Brian clan. Mythic 
tales of Tir Tairrngire (the Land of Promise also known as Fairyland) 
were beautiful to listen to, but she was more interested in the here and 
now. Why was this nutcase after the woman she loved? She decided she 
would ask tonight when she and Mia were in bed.

At last, the elf noted the time and put the pipes down. As the fairy 
left, Arine and Mia both went to the bathroom to brush the garlicky 
smell of homemade spaghetti from their mouths and then headed for bed. 
The elf stripped down by the candlelight of the room and put on her 
nightshirt, looking over to see her beloved in nothing but her bra and 
panties. As the blonde turned her back to her and removed her bra to put 
her own nightshirt on, a very mischievous idea crept into Mia&#39;s head. 
She snuck up behind the reporter, and before Arine could get the 
nightshirt on the elf suddenly brought her hands under the blonde&#39;s 
arms.

Arine screamed as Mia tickled her. She turned around and began to tickle 
the writer back. Soon they both fell on the bed giggling like children 
as each fought for supremacy. In the end though, Arine grabbed Mia&#39;s 
wrists and forced her on her back, straddling her abdomen as she held 
the elf&#39;s hands above her head.

As the two women slowly stopped laughing, Mia looked into Arine&#39;s deep 
blue eyes, &quot;You have vanquished me,&quot; she said as she felt the blonde&#39;s 
breath against her face, &quot;To the victor goes the spoils. I&#39;m now your 
prisoner. So, what do you plan to do with your prize?&quot; she asked, a 
twinkle in her brown eyes.

Arine smiled as she let go of Mia&#39;s arms and moved herself off the 
brunette&#39;s abdomen so that she was now lying topless on top of her. She 
brought her lips to those of the woman she loved as she brought her 
hands to Mia&#39;s breasts. The brunette opened her mouth, and their tongues 
danced around as the blonde kept one hand on Mia&#39;s left breast while her 
other hand grabbed onto her nightshirt and began to tug it up over her 
abdomen. They broke the kiss as the elf quickly removed the article of 
clothing, revealing her beautiful breasts to Arine. Their lips met again 
as the blonde continued to give attention to Mia&#39;s soft breasts. The elf 
meanwhile reached down and grabbed a hold of the blonde&#39;s rear as she 
brought her leg up, causing Arine to find herself suddenly straddling 
Mia&#39;s thigh.

The elf noted with satisfaction that her love&#39;s body suddenly stiffened 
up in a mixture of surprise and pleasure. As she began to slowly lower 
and raise her leg against Arine&#39;s mound while pressing her down into her 
leg with her hands on her rear, the blonde moaned into her mouth. Arine 
pulled back.

&quot;N... no... fair...&quot; she gasped as she found herself grinding against 
the elf&#39;s leg, &quot;Y... aaaaah... you cheated...&quot; Mia chuckled a bit as she 
turned her over, moving her leg out of the way so she could reach her 
hand down instead.

&quot;All&#39;s fair in love and war.&quot; the elf whispered as she massaged the 
blonde&#39;s sex through her panties. As Arine released a moan of bliss the 
elf kissed her way down to her right breast. With her one hand on 
Arine&#39;s sex, Mia began to stroke the reporter&#39;s left breast as she began 
to slowly explore her right with her mouth. Arine reached down and put 
her hands behind the elf&#39;s head as she sucked on her nipple, then moved 
on to the other breast. The blonde began to breathe heavier as Mia 
continued to cup her sex in her hand.

The elf flicked at Arine&#39;s left nipple with her tongue before looking 
back up into her love&#39;s blue eyes. &quot;Mo r&#39;un,&quot; she purred as she slipped 
her hand beneath the fabric of the reporter&#39;s panties and began to 
gently circle her index finger around Arine&#39;s clitoris, &quot;You know,&quot; she 
said playfully, &quot;If you really think I&#39;m being unfair, or that I 
cheated, I could always stop. If you want me to...&quot;

&quot;Hunnngh... N... no, oh God! Oh... d... don&#39;t stop...&quot;

Mia smiled as she brought her lips back to Arine&#39;s, the smell of her 
love&#39;s arousal making her own heart quicken. Pulling away again, she 
moved down her body as she continued moving her finger agonizingly 
slowly around her love&#39;s most sensitive area. She pulled her finger away 
to kiss her through her now damp panties. She then took the fabric in 
her mouth, biting down on it as she pulled back and removed the panties 
with her teeth.

Arine watched the elf&#39;s display through half-closed eyelids. She then 
arched her back as Mia ran her tongue along her cleft, bringing her lips 
to her clit as she inserted two fingers. As Arine began bucking her hips 
in ecstasy, she could feel the elf moving her fingers along the front 
wall of her vagina as if she were looking for something.

A second later her jaw went slack and her world seemed to shatter as the 
elf found it.

Her eyes closed tightly, Arine&#39;s entire universe now consisted of 
nothing but a tongue flicking her sensitive bud and a pair of fingers 
moving back and forth across her g-spot. Her breath came out in gasps, 
and she could feel something building up within her ready to explode. 
She grit her teeth as she clung onto the bedsheets beneath her, her head 
thrashing around as she grunted and moaned in the throes of rapture. 
Finally it hit, and the blond cried out as her muscles tightened and she 
lost herself in the moment.

As her body continued to tremor, she gasped for breath. Mia continued to 
minister to her for a few moments longer in order to ease her down from 
her orgasm before removing her fingers. She licked them clean, and then 
reached down for her discarded nightshirt to use as a makeshift towel to 
gently wipe herself and her love off. She then went up and took the 
exhausted blonde in her arms, holding her tightly until her breathing 
returned to normal.

As the blonde finally caught her breath, she uttered the only thing she 
could think of, &quot;T&#39;a gr&#39;a agam duit (I love you).&quot; she then kissed the 
elf, tasting herself on her love&#39;s lips. As she felt her strength 
returning, she pulled back and smiled impishly.

&quot;That was a dirty trick.&quot; she said as she began to stroke Mia&#39;s thigh, 
&quot;You caught me off guard.&quot;

Mia smiled as the blonde began running the tips of her fingers beneath 
the elf&#39;s panties, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she offered, &quot;You&#39;re just so beautiful 
when you&#39;re in afterglow.&quot;

Arine chuckled a bit at that as she started pulling the elf&#39;s panties 
off. Once they were down, Arine turned her attention back to Mia&#39;s 
breasts. They were slightly larger than hers, and as the blonde slowly 
licked her way in concentric circles around the base of the elf&#39;s right 
breast up to her areola, she could feel Mia squirming underneath her. 
She lightly pinched the brunette&#39;s left nipple while she raked her teeth 
across her right. She then went to Mia&#39;s left breast, giving it the same 
thorough attention as the other.

Mia moaned and threw her head back as Arine then slowly licked her way 
down her abdomen, past her belly button, down to her sex. She separated 
Mia&#39;s now moist lower lips as she inserted her tongue, and quickly 
grabbed onto the elf&#39;s thighs as the brunette started to thrust her 
hips. Now it was Mia&#39;s turn to loose herself as the blonde continued to 
French kiss her sex, occasionally pulling back to give attention to her 
clitoris before going back down.

As Arine reveled in both the honey-like taste of the elf, and in the 
sounds of pleasure escaping her lover&#39;s lips, she could feel Mia&#39;s 
muscles beginning to contract as she neared orgasm. She quickly went 
once again to the brunette&#39;s clit, sucking on it and licking it as Mia 
screamed out Arine&#39;s name. A few seconds later, the elf lay panting for 
air. As the elf&#39;s body became almost limp, Arine made her way up to 
where Mia was and sat cross legged on the bed. She pulled Mia over and 
laid the brunette&#39;s head in her lap, running her fingers gently through 
her chestnut-brown hair as Mia snuggled up closer to her. As she stroked 
a few hairs back, the reporter bent down and kissed her tenderly on the 
forehead.

They stayed together for quite some time with Mia resting her head in 
the blonde&#39;s lap. The elf looked so peaceful and contented as Arine ran 
her fingers through her hair, that it took a few minutes for the 
reporter to remember that she was going to ask Mia something.

&quot;Mia?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; the elf sighed as she closed her eyes.

Arine suddenly wasn&#39;t so sure about bringing up the subject of the feud. 
And yet, she somehow felt she had to know. &quot;Darling, there&#39;s... 
something I need to ask you.&quot;

Mia noted the nervous tone in Arine&#39;s voice, &quot;Yes my love,&quot; she said in 
as reassuring a tone as possible, &quot;You know you can ask me anything.&quot;

Arine took a deep breath as she continued to stroke Mia&#39;s hair, &quot;The... 
the feud,&quot; she said, &quot;the one between your clan and the O&#39;Brian&#39;s. Mia, 
what caused it?&quot;

There was silence for several seconds before Mia finally spoke up, &quot;A 
stolen cow.&quot;

Arine was taken aback by the answer, &quot;A blood feud, started by a stolen 
cow?&quot;

&quot;It was the initial cause,&quot; Mia continued, &quot;The impetus. It was stolen 
by a Shea named Dermat, who was something of the black sheep of our 
clan, from an O&#39;Brian by the name of Ailill,&quot; Arine listened with 
interest as Mia her lover became once again Mia the storyteller, &quot;By the 
time the theft became known, the cow had already been killed by Dermat 
and his wife for its meat. The head of my clan, Fingin Shea, met with 
the owner of the O&#39;Brian farm from where it had been stolen and offered 
an eric, a fine to be paid in restitution for the theft of the cow. 
Ailill and the rest of the O&#39;Brian clan turned the eric offered down, 
instead insisting that Ailill should be given Fingin&#39;s daughter, 
Finola.&quot;

&quot;Finola, so the family stories say, was a gentle lass who had admirers 
from Ulster all the way down to Leinster. When it came to telling 
stories, she was as good as any bard had ever been, and her singing was 
on a par with the fairies. Her beauty was well spoken of by all, and she 
was as beautiful on the inside as she was outside.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Mia said as she continued with her tragic tale, &quot;To make a long 
story short, Finola was sent for by her father Fingin in order to 
restore peace between the clans. She met Ailill O&#39;Brian, and felt 
nothing. There was no love whatsoever between Finola and Ailill. The 
farmer smelled of pigs, and his heart was petty and cruel. Still, the 
beautiful elf would&#39;ve gladly gone through the marriage in order to keep 
the peace between the two clans, and in fact had agreed to a formal 
engagement ceremony. But it was then that she laid eyes on the farmer&#39;s 
sister, the beautiful Nes O&#39;Brian. And both Nes and Finola fell in 
love.&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Arine muttered, suddenly realizing where the story was going. 
Looking down at Mia&#39;s face, she could see a tear work its way down the 
elf&#39;s cheek as she remembered the tale.

&quot;On the eve of the engagement announcement, Ailill... Ailill found 
Finola and Nes in bed together. He took his sword and killed Nes, his 
own sister, right in front of Finola. He then took Finola, and... 
and...&quot; at that point the elf started to weep. Arine pulled Mia up into 
a sitting position and wrapped her arms tightly around the elf as she 
wept. She had no idea the memories would be this painful, and was about 
to tell her to let it go, when the elf once again took up her story.

&quot;She... she made it home to her father Fingin before... before she 
finally passed away, but not before telling him and the others present 
what had happened. The Shea elves retaliated of course, killing Ailill 
and all his menservants before burning his barn to the ground. The 
O&#39;Brian clan heard of this and retaliated with a raid on a group of 
elfin women and children washing their family&#39;s clothes in a stream, 
leaving not one survivor. And it went on from there...&quot;

The reporter held Mia tight as the tears continued to come, &quot;I... I&#39;m so 
sorry.&quot; Arine said, &quot;I didn&#39;t know.&quot;

Mia slowly began to calm down as she wiped the tears away from her eyes, 
&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; she said, &quot;It&#39;s just that, when I think of what that 
monster might&#39;ve done to you if I hadn&#39;t shown up when I did...&quot;

Arine put her index finger under Mia&#39;s chin and tilted her head so they 
were looking at one another, &quot;You did show up, though,&quot; she said softly, 
&quot;And if that O&#39;Brian ass hole comes back, we&#39;ll be ready next time,&quot; she 
said as she kissed the elf tenderly on her lips. Mia looked into Arine&#39;s 
eyes as she reached a hand up to affectionately stroke her cheek.

They both lay down, holding each other as sleep finally came to them.

------

Arine felt something warm on her face. She opened her eyes, only to find 
herself lying on her back, the sun shining down on her as a group of 
birds flew overhead. She slowly raised her head to look around, and 
found herself alone in a lush green island next to the shore, with a 
forest on the other side of the field she was in. She also noticed she 
was completely naked. As a gentle breeze blew around her, she got up to 
her feet.

&quot;Dia duit,&quot; a friendly voice said. Arine turned around and saw an 
adorably cute young girl who couldn&#39;t have been more than thirteen 
swimming in the ocean water, her wavy black hair rolling over her 
shoulders as she looked back at the blonde standing on the shore. When 
Arine didn&#39;t immediately reply, the youngster decided to come closer.

That&#39;s when the blonde saw her fish&#39;s tail wagging behind her.

&quot;A mermaid!&quot; she gasped. At Arine&#39;s shocked look, the young mermaid&#39;s 
face lost its joy and took on more of a concerned look. Before either 
she or Arine could get any further, a third voice was heard.

&quot;Gabh mo leithsc&#39;eal,&quot; a deep male voice said, &quot;Conas t&#39;a; t&#39;u?&quot;

Arine turned around, only to be met by a bigger shock than the mermaid. 
There was a large unicorn staring at her, its long white horn twisting 
up from its brow and the entire animal white as new fallen snow. It 
spoke to her, asking her some further questions, none of which the 
blonde was able to understand. She desperately searched her brain for 
some sort of explanation, and finally, like a distant memory of ages 
gone by, remembered being in a bed holding Mia in her arms.

&#39;A dream,&#39; Arine suddenly realized. And yet, this didn&#39;t have the feel 
of a dream, it was far too vivid. She could feel the sun overhead, the 
grass beneath her, the wind blowing past her naked flesh. The mermaid 
and the Unicorn were both so lifelike, more so than any dream might be. 
As she pondered these things, a woman&#39;s voice called out something. Both 
the unicorn and the mermaid nodded knowingly. The unicorn dashed off for 
the woods, and the mermaid&#39;s cheerful countenance was back.

&quot;Sl&#39;an agat,&quot; she said cheerfully, waving before she disappeared from 
sight under the waters of the lake. As Arine watched her disappear, she 
could hear footsteps crunching the twigs and grass behind her.

&quot;Ye&#39;ll ave t&#39; forgive them.&quot; A lovely feminine voice said behind her, 
&quot;They were just a wee bit curious, and wanted to make sure of yer 
wellbein&#39;.&quot;

Arine turned and saw a young woman in a dress that would&#39;ve been 
considered fashionable back in the nineteenth century, her red hair 
pulled up into a bun and freckles sprinkled liberally around her cheeks 
and on her nose. As she came closer, the blonde suddenly recognized her 
from the photos in the album Maire had shown her.

&quot;Katie?&quot; the blonde asked incredulously, &quot;Katie Flanagan?&quot;

The redhead smiled warmly at the naked woman before her, &quot;Aye,&quot; she 
answered as she nodded her head, &quot;&#39;Tis herself that stands here before 
ye. Come,&quot; she said, holding out a hand to the blonde, &quot;We need to 
talk.&quot;
