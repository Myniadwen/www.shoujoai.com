<a href="../mascots/birthrite-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>As Johan stood at his window, looking up at the sky, the Finn recalled 
the days of his youth. He remembered with perfect clarity the events 
that had led up to where he was that day.

----------

It had all started 20 years before. Back then, Johan was an average, 
16-year-old male. That is, average except for his elfin heritage. It was 
before he had left Finland, before he left on his journey to find the 
Legendary Elf.

Johan, more than any other member of his clan, was adamant about finding 
the elf. Because of this, he had many books pertaining to Norse 
mythology, hoping that they could give him some insight into the 
Prophecy of Awakening. It was during one of Johan&#39;s cram sessions that 
the door to his room opened.

&quot;Hello, Johan,&quot; a warm male voice said from the doorway.

Johan turned to the doorway to see a young man with silver-blond hair 
and deep blue eyes. He was about Johan&#39;s age and looked almost exactly 
like Johan, with only subtle differences in his height and facial 
structure. The only part of the boy&#39;s appearance that was unnusual was 
his pointed ears. &quot;Oh, hello Rikhard,&quot; Johan said, recognizing his 
fraternal twin brother. &quot;How was Norway?&quot;

&quot;It was fantastic,&quot; Rikhard replied. &quot;The people there were so nice. I&#39;m 
glad I went there. It gave me a chance to calm down after what happened 
to Lady Heidi.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I heard about that,&quot; said Johan. &quot;Cardiac arrest, right?&quot;

Rikhard simply nodded. The brothers became solemn. Lady Heidi was the 
leader of the Mustanen Clan before her death several days before. Many 
clan members, including Johan and Rikhard, looked up to Lady Heidi, and 
her death was felt by all.

Changing the subject, Rikhard asked his brother, &quot;What&#39;s that you&#39;re 
reading?&quot;

Glad to be off the subject of Heidi&#39;s death, Johan happily answered, 
&quot;Old Norse mythology.&quot;

&quot;Brushing up on our clan&#39;s history, huh?&quot; asked Rikhard.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Johan explained. &quot;More about the elves in general.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; said Rikhard.

&quot;Brother...&quot; Johan trailed off a bit, &quot;...do you think the Prophecy of 
Awakening will come to pass?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Rikhard replied. &quot;I hope so. Before I succumb to the 
illness that took our father&#39;s life.&quot;

&quot;I wish you didn&#39;t have to endure father&#39;s illness alone,&quot; said Johan. 
&quot;I wish that I could have inherited the disease just like you had.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, Johan,&quot; Rikhard cried. &quot;One of us needs to survive to 
pass down the Legend of Alvara. Our clan is the last remaining clan of 
the elves. If the Legendary Elf is to be born, I believe that it will be 
a child of the Mustanen Clan.&quot;

&quot;Do you think so, Rikhard?&quot; Johan asked.

&quot;I believe it to be so,&quot; replied Rikhard.

&quot;So do I, Brother,&quot; Johan said, a smile beginning to come back to his 
face. &quot;So do I.&quot; Just then, Rikhard started coughing. &quot;Rikhard,&quot; a 
concerned Johan asked, &quot;are you all right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Johan,&quot; Rikhard reassured. &quot;I&#39;m just fine.&quot;

&quot;Rikhard?&quot; a young, female voice said from the doorway.

Johan and Rikhard turned to see a young woman standing in front of them. 
She was no older than Johan, and was very beautiful. She had long, dark 
brown hair that framed a pair of light brown eyes. Instantly, Rikhard&#39;s 
eyes lit up. &quot;Oh, hello Erika,&quot; he said, almost overly enthusiastically.

&quot;Who is that?&quot; Johan asked.

&quot;Johan,&quot; said Rikhard, walking to the girl, &quot;this is my girlfriend, 
Erika Dagomar. Erika, meet my twin brother, Johan.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you, Erika,&quot; Johan said.

&quot;Nice to meet you too, Johan,&quot; Erika said with a smile on her face.

&quot;So,&quot; said Johan, curious as to who this beautiful stranger was. &quot;How 
did you guys meet?&quot;

&quot;We met in Norway,&quot; Rikhard said. &quot;I was watching the sun set in the 
fjords and Erika happened to be standing there, watching the very same 
sunset.&quot;

&quot;The moment we set eyes on each other,&quot; Erika continued, &quot;we knew that 
there was something between us. A mystical bond that brought the two of 
us together.&quot;

&quot;My heart was beating so fast,&quot; said Rikhard, &quot;that I thought I was 
going to have an attack. But thankfully, I was able to calm myself 
down.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; said Johan in a teasing manner, &quot;my twin brother has finally found 
love.&quot;

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t accuse me of taking so long,&quot; Rikhard said. &quot;You haven&#39;t had 
a girlfriend either.&quot; Johan laughed nervously at his brother&#39;s 
statement. Rikhard turned to the brunette and said, &quot;The inauguration of 
Lord Blake as the new clan lord is taking place tonight. Would you like 
to participate in the ceremony?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, I couldn&#39;t,&quot; Erika said. &quot;This is only for members of the 
Mustanen Clan, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;My dear,&quot; Rikhard said, taking Erika&#39;s hands in his, &quot;you are no less a 
member of the Mustanen Clan than I am. I am sure that our mother and 
uncle will gladly give us their blessings.&quot; Rikhard then turned to his 
brother. &quot;You will too, right Johan?&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; Johan exclaimed. &quot;You two look like a great couple.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Rikhard, &quot;I think that I should get some rest. The flight 
took its toll on me. I&#39;ll see you tonight at Uncle&#39;s ceremony, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course, Brother,&quot; said Johan. Rikhard and Erika left Johan to his 
book, most likely to Rikhard&#39;s room.

&#39;Rikhard and Erika Mustanen,&#39; Johan thought to himself. &#39;It has a nice 
ring to it.&#39; Then, Johan made a contemplative face. &#39;Still,&#39; he thought, 
&#39;that name &quot;Dagomar&quot;. I know I&#39;ve heard it somewhere before.&#39; Johan 
shook off the feeling and told himself, &#39;It&#39;s probably nothing. I&#39;ll 
give them my blessings, just like I said I would.&#39;

----------

That night, the reception room was filled with guests. Most of them had 
the blond hair and blue eyes that were indicative of Scandinavian 
heritage, and all of them were part of the Mustanen Clan. The room was 
lively with discussion and conversation. All of the guests seemed to be 
enjoying the refreshments and company.

However, as a middle-aged clan member stepped up to the front of the 
room, the idle conversations stopped and all eyes focused on the man. 
&quot;My friends. Brothers. Sisters,&quot; the man said. &quot;Thank you all for 
coming. I know that many of you are saddened by Lady Heidi&#39;s death, 
especially those that knew her. For many years, Lady Heidi led our clan. 
She made sure that the knowledge of our ancestors was taught to our 
young ones. She made sure that even with the illness that our clan 
carries, we never lost hope. It is an unfortunate irony that it was that 
same illness that took her life in the end. However, Lady Heidi&#39;s 
strength will continue to live on in all of us.&quot; The room took a moment 
of silence to honor Heidi and her life.

&quot;As stated in Lady Heidi&#39;s will,&quot; the speaker continued, &quot;when her role 
as Clan Leader ended, the task would fall upon her cousin&#39;s first son, 
Lord Blake. Lord Blake, please stand.&quot; Blake stood and started walking 
toward the front of the room. The rest of the clan members applauded as 
Blake stood next to the speaker. With the soon-to-be clan leader 
standing at the center of attention, the speaker pulled out of his 
pocket a transparent crystal. &quot;For generations,&quot; said the speaker, &quot;the 
leader of our clan has possessed this jewel. As the new leader of the 
Mustanen Clan, I present to you the White Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan. 
Use this jewel to lead our clan into the future.&quot;

The speaker held out the White Sapphire to Blake, and Blake took it. 
Holding the jewel in his hands, Blake said, &quot;As stated in Lady Heidi&#39;s 
will, I, Lord Blake, hereby succeed her as the leader of the Mustanen 
Clan. With the power of the White Sapphire, I will lead our clan into 
the future just as well as Lady Heidi has. Here&#39;s to our future. May the 
power of our ancestors guide us.&quot;

With Blake&#39;s ceremonial speech delivered, the other clan members 
applauded the completion of Blake&#39;s inauguration as the leader of the 
Mustanen Clan. As Blake stepped down from the front of the room, the 
rest of the clan members went back to their conversations and 
celebrations.

For most of the night, Johan, Rikhard, and Erika had been standing idly 
at the side of the hall. &quot;What did you think of the ceremony, Erika?&quot; 
Rikhard asked his girlfriend.

&quot;Fascinating,&quot; Erika replied. &quot;I&#39;ve never known of a white sapphire 
being passed down from one clan lord to the next.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if you would be able to understand the significance of a 
jewel to our clan,&quot; said Johan.

&quot;Actually, jewels are important to my family as well,&quot; said Erika.

&quot;Are they?&quot; asked Rikhard, fascinated by what Erika had said.

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the brunette. &quot;I know that some jewels grant people 
special abilities. And I am sure that if Lady Heidi&#39;s will stated that 
Lord Blake succeed her, that the White Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan 
grants him those powers.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised that you know of the power that exists inside jewels,&quot; 
said Johan.

&quot;I&#39;m sure families all over Scandinavia have some knowledge of it,&quot; 
Erika said. Although acting warm and fascinated by Erika, Johan secretly 
harbored strong feelings of suspicion toward his brother&#39;s new consort.

----------

After the festivities had ended and most of the clan members had left, 
Rikhard and Erika met with Lord Blake and his sister-in-law, Rikhard and 
Johan&#39;s mother. The two teenagers had news to give to the two elders. 
&quot;Mother, Uncle,&quot; Rikhard said, &quot;Erika and I are getting married.&quot;

Blake and Rikhard&#39;s mother were surprised by the sudden decision. 
&quot;Really?&quot; Blake asked.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you both a little young?&quot; Rikhard&#39;s mother said.

&quot;We know,&quot; Erika said. &quot;But, we love each other very much. We fell in 
love at first sight and we want to make the most of the time we have 
together.&quot;

&quot;I do sense the connection between you two,&quot; said Blake. &quot;And 
considering Rikhard&#39;s condition, I approve of this. Rikhard, Erika, you 
have my blessings.&quot;

Rikhard smiled and bowed his head to Blake in thanks. He then turned to 
the older woman and asked, &quot;Mother?&quot;

It took Rikhard&#39;s mother a moment to think over the situation. 
Eventually, she decided to smile and said, &quot;Rikhard, Erika, you have my 
blessings.&quot;

Both Rikhard and Erika smiled. They looked at each other, leaped into 
each other&#39;s arms and kissed, so happy that they had the blessings of 
the Mustanen Clan.

----------

Rikhard and Erika entered Johan&#39;s room to tell him of their engagement. 
However, they found Johan asleep at his desk with an open book. &quot;Just 
like Johan to fall asleep with his head in a book,&quot; Rikhard whispered to 
his fianc&eacute;.

&quot;He likes reading, does he?&quot; Erika asked.

&quot;He&#39;s very interested in the history of our clan,&quot; Rikhard replied. &quot;I 
think he&#39;s worried about me.&quot;

&quot;Because of your illness?&quot; Erika asked.

Rikhard nodded solemnly. &quot;Lady Heidi died of this illness,&quot; Rikhard 
said. &quot;Our father died of it too soon after we were conceived. But our 
mother knew that Lord Heikki would always live on inside his sons. She 
endured his death, gave birth to us, and raised us for the both of 
them.&quot;

Not wanting to dwell on the subject, Erika suggested, &quot;Do you think that 
maybe we should put Johan to bed?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s probably a good idea,&quot; Rikhard agreed. Rikhard picked up his 
brother by the shoulders and Erika picked up Johan by the legs. After 
laying Johan does on his bed, Erika and Rikhard started leaving the 
room. However, before they closed to door behind them, Rikhard said to 
his sleeping brother, &quot;I hope you will be at our wedding, Johan.&quot;

----------

Rikhard and Erika spent the next several weeks planning their wedding. 
With Erika being accepted into the Mustanen Clan, it was decided that 
the wedding would be held at the Mustanen household, in the same room 
where the clan leaders had been inaugurated.

&quot;This is amazing,&quot; said Erika as she decorated the hall. &quot;Two months 
ago, I would have never believed that I would be getting married at the 
age of sixteen.&quot;

&quot;Me neither,&quot; said Rikhard. &quot;It is pretty incredible.&quot;

&quot;So you think we&#39;re moving too fast?&quot;

&quot;Erika,&quot; Rikhard reassured, &quot;I love you more than anything. And I need 
to do things while I&#39;m still healthy enough to do them.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; said Erika. &quot;But there are still things that we don&#39;t know 
about each other.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Rikhard, &quot;we&#39;ll have the rest of our lives to learn those 
things.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Rikhard,&quot; Erika said, happy that she had met the man standing 
before her. After sharing a kiss, Erika asked, &quot;So. Where should the 
refreshments go?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Rikhard, pointing to where the food was situated at Lord 
Blake&#39;s inauguration, &quot;I was thinking of having all of the food over on 
that side of the room. Maybe one table for refreshments, another for the 
cake, and another for lunch and dinner.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re still planning on the lobster and oysters, right?&quot; asked the 
brunette.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rikhard replied, &quot;we are still planning on the lobster and 
oysters.&quot;

&quot;Do you think we should add on some caviar while we&#39;re at it?&quot; asked 
Erika.

&quot;Caviar&#39;s not a bad idea,&quot; agreed Rikhard. &quot;It can be a garnish for the 
oysters.&quot;

&quot;Nice thinking, Rick.&quot;

&quot;You want to help move the tables over to the side of the room?&quot;

&quot;Of course, my love.&quot; Rikhard and Erika started pushing one of the 
tables over to the side of the room. It was heavy, but they wanted their 
wedding to be perfect, so they decided that it was worth the effort. 
&quot;Phew,&quot; said Erika, wiping her brow after the table had been put into 
position. &quot;That was a workout. Maybe we should move the other tables 
later.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right,&quot; Rikhard agreed.

Just then, Rikhard was overcome by a voilent fit of coughing. He covered 
his mouth and fell to his knees. &quot;Rikhard,&quot; Erika cried, rushing to her 
fianc&eacute;&#39;s side, &quot;are you all right.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just fine,&quot; Rikhard said. &quot;This happens sometimes.&quot;

However, when Rikhard removed his hand from his mouth, both he and Erika 
were horrified to see blood on his hand and dripping from his mouth! 
&quot;You&#39;re not all right!&quot; Erika screamed.

&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; Rikhard said, in a state of shock.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Erika said, lifting Rikhard to his feet and draping one of 
his arms over her shoulders. &quot;Let&#39;s get you to the infirmary.&quot;

----------

Using modern medicine and whatever mystical powers they had inherited 
from their elfin ancestors, the witch doctors of the Mustanen Clan 
diagnosed Rikhard&#39;s symptom as a result of his genetic disorder, the 
same disorder that gave many of the Mustanen Clan, including Rikhard and 
Blake, their visibly pointed ears.

&quot;When Sir Rikhard pushed the table,&quot; one of the doctors said, 
&quot;considerable stress was put on his heart. Because of this, his heart 
was unable to properly pump blood away from his lungs.&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s why I started coughing up blood,&quot; Rikahrd realized.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the doctor reaffirmed.

&quot;What threat does this pose to Rikhard?&quot; asked Erika, worried about her 
fianc&eacute;&#39;s welbeing.

&quot;In most cases of this disease,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;death is caused by 
sudden cardiac arrest, resulting from an overworked heart. It seems that 
in Sir Rikhard&#39;s case, his heart is losing strength gradually over a 
long period of time. It saddens me to say this, but I would estimate 
that Sir Rikhard does not have more than ten years left.&quot;

The horrifying news of Rikhard&#39;s inevitable fate was too much for Erika 
to bear. The brunette fell to her hands and knees and broke down into 
tears. Using what strength he had regained, Rikhard managed to stand up 
and go to Erika, embracing her, trying to comfort her.

----------

It was not long before the rest of the family was told of Rikhard&#39;s 
eventual end. Although everyone was saddened by the news, Johan was the 
only one that expressed his sadness with anger. As soon as he had heard 
of his brother&#39;s fate, he retreated into his room and spent a long time 
simply pacing back and forth.

Eventually, Johan&#39;s legs became tired and he simply threw himself onto 
his bed. &#39;I can&#39;t believe it!&#39; the 16-year-old thought. &#39;Rikhard, my 
twin brother, has less than ten years to live.&#39; Johan rolled onto his 
stomach, looking at the sheets below him. &#39;If the Jewel Summoners hadn&#39;t 
destroyed out ancestors fifteen hundred years ago, we would still have 
access to the gene sequences that gave the elves strength. The strength 
to counteract this genetic defect.&#39; Suddenly, Johan had a frightening 
realization. &#39;The Jewel Summoners!&#39; he thought. &#39;Could it be...?&#39; Hoping 
to confirm his realization before it was too late, Johan jumped out of 
bed, went to his desk, and started reading the text written in his books 
of Norse mythology.

----------

The day of the wedding arrived. As leader of the clan, Lord Blake was 
chosen as the minister. All of the clan members were happy for Rikhard 
and Erika...all except for Johan. Although he hid it well, his 
suspicions about Erika were continuing to grow.

&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; said Erika and she and Rikhard entered their room. 
&quot;Man and wife.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Rikhard. &quot;Here we are indeed.&quot;

Despite the joyous occasion of their union, the celebratory atmosphere 
was simply a cover-up for the sadness that Erika and Rikhard felt. &quot;What 
are we going to do, Rikhard?&quot; asked Erika, saddened by Rikhard&#39;s 
steadily worsening condition. &quot;What are we going to do?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Erika,&quot; Rikhard said. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t stand to be without you,&quot; Erika mourned. &quot;Why did it have to be 
this way?&quot;

&quot;This gene has been passed down through my family for generations,&quot; 
Rikhard explained. &quot;We believe there was once a gene that was able to 
counteract the ill effects of this one, but it has been lost to the 
sands of time.&quot;

&quot;I just with there was something we could do to keep you alive.&quot;

&quot;I know, my darling,&quot; Rikhard said, embracing his wife. &quot;I know.&quot;

----------

Meanwhile, Johan was continuing his search for the truth, furiously 
reading through his Norse mythology books. &quot;I have to find out who the 
Dagomars are,&quot; Johan said to himself. &quot;I know I&#39;ve heard that name 
before. Brother, don&#39;t fall into the trap that our ancestors did.&quot;

----------

&quot;Rikhard,&quot; Erika cried, &quot;don&#39;t you know what you are asking?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m asking to consummate our love,&quot; Rikhard repeated himself. &quot;We do 
not have much time left, and we may not have another chance. I want to 
become one with you before we run out of time.&quot; Erika looked into her 
lap, thinking about what Rikhard was suggesting. &quot;Please, Erika.&quot;

Tears started welling in the young woman&#39;s eyes. &quot;Oh, Rikhard!&quot; she 
cried, jumping into her husband&#39;s arms. They wrapped their arms around 
one another and met in a passionate kiss.

----------

&#39;Brother won&#39;t believe me unless I give him proof of Erika&#39;s treachery,&#39; 
Johan thought as he opened his book a chapter entitled, &quot;The Jewel 
Summoners&quot;.

Johan read the text, very deliberate in reading each word, knowing that 
what he was looking for was buried in the words somewhere. Finally, 
Johan found what he was looking for. &quot;Here it is!&quot; he cried. &quot;I knew it! 
Rikhard, you must not continue with this woman!&quot; The boy picked up his 
book and exited his room.

As Johan walked down the long hallway, he could hear moaning from 
Rikhard&#39;s room. However, it did not hit him what was happening until he 
heard Erika&#39;s voice crying out from behind the door. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; said 
Johan as he made a bolt for the door. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not too late!&quot;

Johan was petrified by what he saw when he opened his brother&#39;s door. 
Both Rikhard and Erika were naked. Rikhard was lying motionless on his 
bed; Erika was sitting next to him, looking at his body. With all of his 
suspicions about Erika painfully confirmed, Johan&#39;s rage exploded from 
him. &quot;You bitch!&quot; Johan screamed at the woman before him. &quot;You people 
haven&#39;t changed in fifteen hundred years. You&#39;re still trying to 
complete your mission. Well let me tell you something, Dagomar, you will 
never destroy the elves completely! The Prophecy of Awakening will come 
to pass, I assure you! The new age of the elves will come to pass and 
you Jewel Summoners will be destroyed just like our people were 
destroyed!&quot;

Johan rushed to his brother&#39;s desk and picked up the white sapphire that 
Rikhard had frequently used as a paperweight. Using the white sapphire&#39;s 
power, Johan summoned a powerful force that threw Erika from the bed and 
onto the floor. Erika found herself lying next to her coat and she 
quickly reached into it, pulling out a golden-yellow crystal. The 
crystal had barely begun to start glowing when Johan threw another 
attack at Erika, knocking the crystal from her hand.

With the power of Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire with him, Johan chased Erika 
out of his brother&#39;s room. &quot;I&#39;ll never forgive you!&quot; the boy screamed, 
throwing attack after attack at Erika. &quot;You corrupt my brother&#39;s heart, 
then you have your way with him, knowing full well what it would do to 
him! You bitch!&quot;

Erika found the exit and ran out into the snow-covered Scandinavian 
landscape. Johan continued chasing. &quot;I&#39;m not going to let you die from 
the cold, Dagomar!&quot; he said. Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire started glowing 
white and a powerful force threw Erika backwards, toward Johan. Using 
his free hand, Johan grabbed Erika by the neck. &quot;I will be the one to 
kill you,&quot; he said, looking Erika square in the eyes. &quot;I will not grant 
you the luxury of dying from anything besides my hands.&quot;

Slowly, Johan started tightening his grip on Erika&#39;s neck. The brunette 
started chocking as her windpipe was crushed. she struggled to break 
free from Johan&#39;s grip, but she could not overcome Johan&#39;s strength. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Johan said, an evil grin coming across his face. &quot;That&#39;s it. 
Struggle all you want. Try to escape. Let me see the fear in your eyes 
as the life drains from you.&quot; Erika&#39;s eyes rolled back in her head as 
Johan continued to tighten his grip on her throat. Her struggling slowly 
became less and less violent as her strength left her. &quot;Die. Die! DIE!!&quot; 
cried Johan.

Just then, out of nowhere, a glowing red javelin flew toward Johan. His 
foresight alerting him to the danger, Johan dropped Erika and dodged out 
of the way. The boy looked in the direction that the javelin was thrown 
from and saw a band of several elderly warriors, each one of them 
holding glowing red spinel crystals.

&quot;Madame Erika!&quot; one of the Jewel Summoners cried at seeing the young 
woman lying unconscious on the snow. &quot;What have you done to Madame 
Erika, you monster?&quot; The Jewel Summoner summoned a vehicle, similar in 
design to a motorcycle, composed entirely of glowing red crystal. The 
Jewel Summoner drove the vehicle straight toward Johan, but the boy 
jumped out of the way before he was run over. As he drove by, the Jewel 
Summoner grabbed Erika and picked her up.

Seeing that Erika was being dragged to safety, Johan used the power of 
Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire and threw another attack at the Jewel Summoner. 
Before the attack hit, the Jewel Summoner took out a glowing apatite 
crystal and used the green crystals power to drag him and Erika toward 
the other Jewel Summoners. Johan&#39;s attack hit the snow where the spinel 
vehicle had disappeared.

The Jewel Summoner retreated behind the other Jewel Summoners, who were 
standing as a wall to protect Erika. Johan saw a magenta glow coming 
from behind the wall of Jewel Summoners, indicating the activation of an 
amethyst crystal.

Johan held up the white sapphire. The transparent crystal started 
glowing white as Johan prepared to fire another attack at the Jewel 
Summoners. However, one of the Jewel Summoners pulled out a crystal of 
the deepest red. The red crystal started glowing and the white sapphire 
stopped glowing. The Jewel Summoner had somehow used his crystal to 
negate the power of the sapphire! Suddenly, Johan knew what it was that 
the Jewel Summoner was holding.

In awe of the Ruby that the Jewel Summoner held, Johan was distracted 
from the other Jewel Summoners summoning more crystal vehicles. Before 
Johan could snap out of his trance, the Jewel Summoners were already too 
far ahead for him to catch up.

For a moment, Johan simply stared into the distance, watching the 
glowing red vehicles disappear into the night. As reality began to sink 
in, Johan felt his rage build up again inside him. He yelled into the 
night and fell to his knees, pounding his fists against the snow. 
&quot;Why?!&quot; Johan cried. &quot;Why? Why did it have to turn out this way? 
Brother, Rikhard, forgive me. I wasn&#39;t able to save you. I wasn&#39;t able 
to avenge you.&quot;

Just then, without the use of any of Johan&#39;s power, the transparent 
crystal in his hand started glowing. &quot;Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire?&quot; said 
Johan, looking at the sapphire in wonder. Johan concentrated on the 
sapphire, feeling the power that it possessed. &quot;Brother?&quot; Johan said. 
&quot;Your spirit is inside this crystal.&quot; Johan closed his eyes and 
attempted to commune with his brother&#39;s spirit. &quot;Brother. Speak to me. 
Guide me.&quot; The white glow of the sapphire extended to engulf Johan&#39;s 
body. The boy felt the power of the sapphire and his brother within him. 
&quot;Alvara?&quot; Johan asked. &quot;Brother, what do you mean, Alvara?&quot; Johan 
continued listening. &quot;The Ruby?&quot; he asked. The glowing of the sapphire 
stopped and Johan&#39;s eyes snapped open. &quot;Dagomar,&quot; he said, &quot;you are 
mine!&quot;

----------

For nearly a year, Johan used the power of Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire to 
track the movements of the Red Ruby of Alvara. It was in the Far East 
that Johan finally caught up to the Ruby. It was a forested area. If it 
were not for the power of Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire, Johan would have 
become lost in the woods.

&quot;Brother,&quot; Johan said as he hiked through the forest, &quot;soon I will find 
the Red Ruby. Soon, your death will be avenged.&quot;

As Johan continued hiking, he came across a small hut in the middle of 
the forest. Seeing the hut before him, he rushed to the door and burst 
in. &quot;Dagomar!&quot; he called out. &quot;Dagomar, are you in here?&quot; Johan searched 
the small structure, but found no sign of the person he was hunting. 
&quot;She must have sensed the presence of Rikhard&#39;s sapphire,&quot; Johan said to 
himself.

Johan made another search through the hut to see if he could find a 
trail if Erika had left one. It did not take Johan long to find a small 
bit of blood on the floor. He followed the trail if blood to a back door 
that Erika must have used to escape. Again, Johan trekked through the 
forest. &quot;Where are you, Dagomar?&quot; Johan asked. &quot;I know you&#39;re around 
here somewhere. I&#39;m going to find you. You can&#39;t hide from me forever, 
you Bitch.&quot;

A moment passed as Johan viewed his surroundings, looking for any sign 
of Erika&#39;s presence. Then, he heard someone coughing. The sound was 
coming from some bushes several meters away. Johan walked toward the 
bushes. However, Erika had already left. Johan again enlisted the aid of 
the white sapphire. The sapphire began glowing white and Johan followed 
its pull.

As Johan came out of the trees, he found himself on a ridge, which led 
to the top of a waterfall. On the ridge was Erika. Johan was pleased to 
see that the young woman was not in the best of health. She was wearing 
a worn-out jacket and it seemed that she had difficulty walking. She 
used a walking stick to stay standing.

As Erika struggled to get away, Johan simply walked up behind her and 
picked her up by the scruff of her worn-out coat. &quot;I found you, 
Dagomar,&quot; Johan grinned.

&quot;You don&#39;t understand, Johan,&quot; Erika said weakly. Her voice was raspy, 
as if she had trouble breathing.

&quot;Oh, I understand,&quot; Johan said, refusing to hear Erika&#39;s explanation. &quot;I 
understand that you fucked my brother, knowing that with his condition, 
it would kill him. And now, you are trying to claim that you were 
innocent and that you were simply doing what people in love do. Well I 
am not the fool that you take me for, Dagomar!&quot; still holding Erika by 
the scruff of her jacket, Johan kicked her hard in the back, knocking 
her to the ground. Erika started coughing violently, a small bit of 
blood dripping from her mouth. &quot;Well, well,&quot; said Johan. &quot;It seems that 
you were not unaffected by my strangling you ten months ago. I&#39;m glad.&quot;

&quot;Johan. Please,&quot; Erika pleaded.

&quot;I will not listen to y our lies.&quot; Johan kicked Erika again and again. 
When he felt that he had kicked Erika enough, he picked her up by her 
neck just as he had done back in Finland. &quot;Suffer, Dagomar,&quot; he said. 
&quot;You and all the Jewel Summoners will suffer for the pain that you have 
inflicted upon my kind, upon my family, upon my father, upon my 
brother!&quot;

Before Erika had choked to death, the white sapphire in Johan&#39;s hand 
began glowing. It was pulling Johan toward Erika&#39;s jacket. Johan dropped 
Erika and reached into Erika&#39;s pocket and pulled out a brilliant red 
crystal. &quot;The Red Ruby of Alvara,&quot; said Johan, amazed that he was 
actually holding the fabled jewel. &quot;I have been tracking this crystal 
all over the world with my brother&#39;s white sapphire. Ironic that such a 
powerful crystal in the hands of a Jewel Summoner was the very cause of 
that Jewel Summoners demise.&quot; As Johan was distracted by his awe of the 
Ruby, Erika had started crawling to the edge of the waterfall. &quot;Where do 
you think you&#39;re going, Dagomar?&quot; Johan asked, noticing Erika crawling 
away.

At the edge of the waterfall, Erika painfully got to her feet. &quot;I tried 
to tell you, Johan,&quot; she said. &quot;But I see that it is pointless to try to 
convince you. Since there is nothing more that I can do to help, my life 
may just as well end here. I&#39;m sorry, Johan.&quot; Erika closed her eyes and 
spread her arms out to her sides. A single tear dripped down her cheek. 
&quot;Rikhard...&quot; she said wistfully.

Then, Erika started leaning backward. &quot;No!&quot; Johan cried, seeing that 
Erika was about to fall off the edge. He ran toward her, but she had 
already fallen. Johan watched as Erika&#39;s body was engulfed by the mist 
of the waterfall. Again, Johan fell to his knees, feeling defeated. 
&quot;Curse you, Dagomar,&quot; he said softly. His next words were anything but 
soft. &quot;Damn you to hell! I was supposed to be the one to kill you! I was 
supposed to have revenge! Damn you, and all the Jewel Summoners!&quot;

Johan was taken out of his fit of rage when he noticed the Red Ruby of 
Alvara glowing. He then looked at the white sapphire to find that it was 
glowing as well. &quot;The Red Ruby of Alvara and Brother&#39;s white sapphire. 
They&#39;re calling to each other?&quot; Slowly, Johan moved the Ruby and the 
sapphire closer together. The intensity of their glowing increased. As 
the two crystals touched, a bright, red flash came from the point of 
contact. Johan had to shield his eyes with his right arm.

When the bright light had died down, there was only one crystal in 
Johan&#39;s left hand. It was the Red Ruby of Alvara, but it had increased 
in size by the white sapphire&#39;s volume. &quot;They fused together?&quot; Johan 
said in wonder. &quot;The Red Ruby must have the power to absorb the powers 
of other rubies and sapphires. This truly is the key to finding the elf! 
I guess the Jewel Summoner&#39;s aren&#39;t good for nothing after all.&quot;

Although Johan had failed in his mission to kill Erika himself, he had 
received a great consolation, the fabled Red Ruby of Alvara. Satisfied 
for the time being, Johan returned home. He spent the next 2 years 
continuing his education, biding his time until the time came for the 
Prophecy of Awakening to come to pass.

----------

As his high school education came to an end, Johan decided to continue 
journeying, hoping that the Red Ruby of Alvara would eventually lead him 
to the elf. At the age of 18, Johan found himself studying at a 
university in St. Petersburg, Russia. Johan was sitting in a lecture 
hall, waiting for class to start, when another student, several years 
older than him, sat down beside him. It was a man in his mid-twenties. 
He had brown hair, dressed formally, and had a warm, friendly smile on 
his face. &quot;Bonjour,&quot; the man said.

&quot;Bonjour to you too,&quot; said Johan, not particularly interested in 
conversing with this man.

&quot;Let me guess,&quot; the man said in a French accent. &quot;Swedish?&quot;

&quot;Finnish,&quot; Johan corrected the man.

&quot;Ah, you&#39;re a Finn,&quot; said the man, still keeping his warm, friendly air 
about him. &quot;I have friends in Finland.&quot;

&quot;Do you?&quot; Johan asked, remaining bored an uninterested.

&quot;Just trying to be friendly,&quot; said the man.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Johan, &quot;but I am in no need of friends.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on. What kind of talk is that? Let&#39;s try an introduction.&quot; 
Holding out his hand to shake, the man said, &quot;Nice to meet you. My name 
is Pierre Doulin.&quot;

&quot;Please, Mister Doulin,&quot; said Johan. &quot;I don&#39;t have time for games.&quot; As 
Johan finished his sentence, he then remembered the name &quot;Doulin&quot;. It 
was the same feeling that he had when he heard his brother mention the 
name &quot;Dagomar&quot;. This man was a Jewel Summoner! &quot;On second thought,&quot; 
Johan said, &quot;why don&#39;t I give it a try?&quot; He took Pierre&#39;s hand in his 
and said, &quot;Nice to meet you, Mister Doulin. My name is Johan Mustanen.&quot;

&quot;See?&quot; Pierre said, smiling. &quot;Doesn&#39;t it feel good to have a friend?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Johan. &quot;It does.&quot;

----------

17 years later, Johan was where he was today. &quot;I stuck by you for 
seventeen years, Pierre,&quot; he said, looking out his window at the plane 
that flew by. &quot;I even followed you to America. I could not kill you 
right away; I foresaw that you would lead me to the elf. And now that I 
have found the elf, I have no more use for you. You will die, just like 
Erika Dagomar.
