It was 6:32 pm, Eastern Time when the plane from Oceanside landed in New 
York City. Mia, Arine, Sam, and Pierre had spent more than 
five-and-a-half hours in the air. Having traveled over three time zones, 
they were beginning to feel the effects of jetlag. &quot;Ugh,&quot; said Arine. 
&quot;We are going in the wrong direction.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;East instead of west,&quot; Mia said. &quot;Our internal clocks are having 
trouble adjusting.&quot;

&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; said Sam, now understanding. &quot;It is true,&quot; he agreed. &quot;It&#39;s 
harder going east than it is going west.&quot;

As the three college students were chatting, Pierre was scanning the 
crowd. Then, he saw two people walking toward them, a man and a woman. 
Both had dark hair, which would have been pitch-black if it were not for 
a sprinkle of gray that was starting to appear at their age. Pierre 
recognized them instantly. &quot;Sir David!&quot; he called. &quot;Madame Julia! 
Bonjour!&quot;

&quot;Bonjour, Sir Pierre!&quot; the couple said in unison.

By then, Mia, Arine, and Sam had looked to see whom Pierre was calling 
to. Mia, for one, was overjoyed at seeing the middle-aged couple. 
&quot;Mister and Missus Lancestor!&quot; The brunette screamed, running to them.

&quot;Mia Carver, is that you?&quot; the woman asked.

&quot;My have you grown!&quot; said the man.

As Mia reached the two, she gripped them and pulled them into a tight 
embrace. &quot;It&#39;s great to see you guys again,&quot; she said, letting go of the 
couple to look at them face-to-face.

&quot;How long has it been,&quot; said the woman, &quot;ten years?&quot;

&quot;How are your parents, Mia?&quot; the man asked.

&quot;They&#39;re fine,&quot; replied Mia. &quot;Of course I don&#39;t see them very often 
since they&#39;re still in Vegas.&quot;

&quot;I trust you&#39;ve been taking care of her, Sam,&quot; said the woman, 
pretending to come down on the boy.

&quot;Yes, Mother,&quot; said Sam, pretending to be embarrassed by the woman. 
After a brief moment of laughter, Sam embraced his parents.

&quot;Who would have thought,&quot; said Mr. Lancestor. &quot;Mia Carver, the elf.&quot;

&quot;I was surprised as well,&quot; Sam said. &quot;Before last week, I didn&#39;t think 
that Mia&#39;s pointed ears meant anything!&quot;

After the reunion of Mia and the Lancestors, Julia noticed the 
blond-haired girl simply looking on at them. &quot;And this must be Arine 
Sylven,&quot; Mrs. Lancestor said.

Arine held out her hand toward the woman and said, &quot;Pleased to meet you, 
Missus Lancestor.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; said the woman, &quot;call me Julia.&quot; Arine and Mrs. Lancestor 
shook hands.

&quot;And you may call me David,&quot; Mr. Lancestor said, holding out his hand.

Arine shook David&#39;s hand and said, &quot;Nice to meet you, David.&quot;

After all of the introductions had been completed, Pierre piped in, 
&quot;Well, what say you we get some food? We have less than an 
hour-and-a-half until the flight to Zurich leaves.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Julia said. &quot;We probably won&#39;t have anything to 
eat until tomorrow morning.&quot;

Sam, remembering the last time he was at the New York City Airport, said 
to the brown-haired girl, &quot;They have a sushi bar nearby, Mia.&quot;

Her face lighting up, Mia cried, &quot;Sushi? Yay! I love sushi!&quot;

----------

The six companions sat down for a Japanese dinner. &quot;Mia has been 
fascinated with Japanese culture as long as anyone can remember,&quot; Julia 
explained.

&quot;I know,&quot; said Arine. &quot;She told me that her parents found her in Japan 
as a baby.&quot;

&quot;A newborn, actually,&quot; said David. &quot;Judging from her weight and level of 
development, the doctors estimated that she was no more than few days 
old when she was found.&quot;

&quot;I wonder who her real parents were,&quot; said Arine.

&quot;Not knowing her true origins,&quot; David continued, &quot;Mister and Missus 
Carver decided to give the child a Japanese name because that was where 
they found her.&quot;

&quot;I thought her name sounded Japanese,&quot; the blonde said.

&quot;Her biological parents were obviously descendants of the elves,&quot; said 
Julia. &quot;Otherwise, Mia would not have any elfin powers and she probably 
would not have had the ears either.

&quot;The ears are kind of cute...&quot; said Arine. She then looked at Mia and 
said, her voice a little lower, &quot;...but I wish they didn&#39;t come with her 
weak heart.&quot;

&quot;Her powers are beginning to awaken,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;We saw the strength 
that she showed the other night. When she completely awakens, I am sure 
that her elfin powers will give her the strength to overcome her heart 
condition.&quot;

&quot;As long as Arine is with me,&quot; said Mia, wrapping her arm around Arine&#39;s 
back, placing her hand on the blonde&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I feel like I can do 
anything.&quot; Turning to Arine, she asked, &quot;How are you enjoying your 
California Roll?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good,&quot; Arine replied. &quot;It&#39;s not like it&#39;s anything new to me. I&#39;ve 
had California Rolls before.&quot;

&quot;Well of course you have,&quot; said Mia. &quot;It&#39;s only natural to suspect that 
a girl from the West Coast has had California Rolls. Maybe you would 
like to try something a little more exotic?&quot;

&quot;What about your eel?&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot; Mia picked up a piece of her sushi order 
with her chopsticks and brought the piece in front of Arine&#39;s mouth. 
Arine opened her mouth and ate the piece of sushi that Mia had fed to 
her. &quot;How is it, Arine?&quot; the brunette asked.

Arine swallowed and said, a little surprised, &quot;It&#39;s good. It&#39;s really 
good!&quot;

&quot;Unagi has always been my favorite sushi.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll definitely order unagi the next time I go out for sushi.&quot;

As Mia and Arine chatted and ate, David whispered to Sam, &quot;How did Arine 
talk you out of going out with Mia?&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t,&quot; Sam whispered back. &quot;I was the one who told Arine to go 
out with Mia.&quot;

David was stunned by his son&#39;s response. &quot;You did WHAT?!&quot; he said as 
quietly as possible.

&quot;Mia knew me as a brother figure,&quot; Sam explained. &quot;She couldn&#39;t love me 
any other way. It was only after her attack two weeks ago that I saw it. 
And I could see in Arine&#39;s eyes that she was crazy about Mia. But she 
was too afraid to admit her love for her best friend, so I gave her a 
nudge in the right direction. And just look at them now.&quot; Sam and David 
looked at the two girls. &quot;Doesn&#39;t seeing them together just make you so 
happy?&quot;

&quot;They do look very happy together,&quot; David agreed.

&quot;Madame Julia,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I need to know. What has the Lancestor 
Clan found out about the Prophecy of Awakening?&quot;

&quot;Not much,&quot; Julie replied. &quot;What we have found suggests that there is 
some power hidden within the Red Ruby and Blue Sapphire of Alvara that 
is supposed to unlock the elf&#39;s powers.&quot;

&quot;The Ruby and Sapphire are the keys?&quot;

&quot;That is what the Lancestor Clan has been led to believe.&quot;

&quot;Why would Johan keep the Ruby from the elf?&quot; Pierre thought to himself.

&quot;&#39;Johan&#39;?&quot; Julia asked.

&quot;I&#39;ll bring it up at the meeting in Zurich,&quot; Pierre said.

----------

Meanwhile, an expedition in Scandinavia was in progress. Several Nordic 
people were trekking through the taiga forest. &quot;How much further is it?&quot; 
one of the younger hikers asked.

&quot;According to Lord Blake&#39;s findings,&quot; the leader of the expedition 
explained, &quot;it should be about fifty meters ahead.&quot;

&quot;How do we know this place really exists?&quot; another trekker asked.

&quot;If it did not exist,&quot; said the leader, &quot;the Red Ruby and Blue Sapphire 
of Alvara would not have been discovered in the first place. The Clan 
Lords and I talked for many hours about granting me the White Sapphire 
while Lord Blake is cared for.&quot;

Eventually, the hikers came out of the trees. What they found before 
them was a large, deep lake. &quot;Suit up,&quot; the leader said. The hikers 
opened up their backpacks and took out wetsuits and swim fins, which 
they then changed into. The trekkers reached back into their packs and 
took out scuba gear. They strapped the oxygen tanks onto their backs and 
fit their heads into their helmets. Through the radio system that the 
helmets had built into them, the trekkers heard their leader ask, &quot;Ready 
everyone?&quot; The rest of the team gave their leader &quot;okay&quot; signals. The 
leader had a flashlight in his right hand and in his left hand, he held 
the White Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan. With everything that the 
expedition needed, the group dove into the lake and started descending 
into the depths.

&quot;This had better not be a wild goose chase,&quot; said one of the female 
members.

&quot;This is an historical place, Madame Annika,&quot; said the leader. &quot;We are 
about to find a ceremonial ground where our ancestors held their 
meetings. The place where the Ruby and Sapphire were excavated.&quot; As the 
team searched the lakebed, the White Sapphire started glowing. &quot;The 
White Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan is directing me,&quot; the leader said. 
&quot;We&#39;re close.&quot; Directed by the pull of the White Sapphire, the leader 
aimed his flashlight to where the crystal directed him. The flashlight 
fell on a small cavity in the lakebed. &quot;This way,&quot; he said, swimming 
toward the cavity.

The cavity was just large enough to fit an average adult. The leader 
swam into the cavity and the other members of the expedition followed. 
&quot;Are you sure about this, Lord Odin?&quot; one of the members said, becoming 
apprehensive about the risk involved in such a venture.

&quot;We&#39;ve come too far to turn back now,&quot; said the leader.

&quot;It&#39;s so dark here,&quot; Annika said, also becoming nervous.

&quot;Do not worry,&quot; said Odin. &quot;The White Sapphire is guiding me.&quot;

----------

Odin and his followers emerged from a pool of water situated in a cave. 
&quot;What is this place?&quot; One of the members asked as he surfaced.

Odin took off his helmet. &quot;This must be it,&quot; he said. &quot;We found it.&quot; 
Odin stepped out of the pool and held out the White Sapphire of the 
Mustanen Clan and the crystal started glowing white. Suddenly, crystals 
in the rock-face of the cave started glowing. There were shades of red, 
blue, green, white. The entire cave lit up with all the colors of the 
rainbow. The members of the expedition could not help but stare in awe 
at the light before them. &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Odin said, feeling 
very proud about himself and his team, &quot;welcome to the sanctuary of the 
elves.&quot;

&quot;I never knew anyplace could be so beautiful,&quot; one of the members said.

&quot;All of these crystals are rubies and sapphires,&quot; Odin explained. &quot;They 
are reacting to the presence of the White Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan. 
The discovery of this place will give new hope to our people. A tie to 
the past. A way of remembering our heritage.&quot;

&quot;Look at this,&quot; said Annika at one end of the cave. The other members of 
the expedition joined Annika to see what she had found. It was a large 
chamber, an extension of the cave. Inside the chamber were all sorts of 
sculptures, gemstones, and tablets. &quot;This looks like some kind of 
repository,&quot; said Annika as the anthropologist on the team. &quot;A place 
where the elves kept their most valued treasures.&quot;

As the team looked at the artifacts, Annika picked up a stone tablet 
with ancient text carved into it. Upon looking at the text, Annika&#39;s 
eyes widened and she gasped. &quot;My god,&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;It&#39;s a manuscript 
of Alvara himself! Text written by the most powerful of all the elves.&quot;

&quot;Can you read it, Madame Annika?&quot; asked Odin.

&quot;I can try,&quot; the anthropologist said. Annika translated the ancient text 
on the tablet, &quot; Written here is the last account of Alvara, son of 
Aelfhere. It has been seven thousand and five hundred years since our 
last contact with the race of humans. But several months ago, humans 
have returned to our territory. They have sent powerful sorcerers to 
destroy our race. I believe it is because of a new religion spreading 
through the continent and that our existence threatens that religion. 
Even with the powers that the elves have been granted, we cannot hold 
off the Jewel Sorcerers&#39; raid. There is not enough ruby or sapphire in 
our part of the world to use against them. My family and I have spent 
the past two days in this cave of crystal. There were two crystals that 
were loose enough to pull from the walls, a Red Ruby and a Blue 
Sapphire. These crystals were more brilliant than any other crystals I 
had seen. I knew that their powers were great. But I was not able to use 
their power to drive the Jewel Sorcerers away.&quot;

&quot;Look at this,&quot; said one of the members as he was searching through the 
other artifacts.

&quot;What is it, Sir Ollie?&quot; asked Odin.

&quot;It appears to be some kind of decorative design,&quot; said Ollie, holding 
up a tablet made entirely of corundum. Many smaller crystals of 
different color had been carved and cemented together into one large, 
smooth tablet.

Odin observed the color scheme of the crystals that made up the tablet. 
&quot;Is there a pattern to it?&quot; he asked Ollie.

&quot;Not that I can see,&quot; Ollie replied. Odin held the White Sapphire of the 
Mustanen Clan close to the tablet and concentrated. The White Sapphire 
started glowing. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Ollie asked Odin.

&quot;I wonder if this tablet will react to the activation of the Sapphire,&quot; 
the team leader replied. A moment passed, but the tablet did not react. 
&quot;No good,&quot; Odin said as the White Sapphire stopped glowing. &quot;What on 
earth is this tablet for?&quot; he wondered to himself.

----------

Meanwhile, Johan was sitting at his computer on a travel agency&#39;s 
website, ordering a ticket to France. Johan had almost confirmed the 
trip when his phone rang. He picked up the phone and said, &quot;Johan 
Mustanen speaking.&quot;

&quot;Sir Johan,&quot; a familiar voice said on the line,&quot; hello.&quot;

&quot;Lord Odin?&quot; Johan asked.

&quot;Sir Johan,&quot; said Odin, &quot;we have fantastic news.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; Johan said, becoming more intrigued by the second.

&quot;The Alvara Expedition was a success.&quot;

Odin&#39;s last statement was what took the cake for Johan. &quot;You found the 
excavation site?&quot; said Johan, very excited about the expedition&#39;s 
success.

&quot;We found artifacts dating back to before the Jewel Summoners came,&quot; 
Odin explained.

&quot;Well this is fantastic. Finally, our young one will have visual proof 
of their heritage. Not just what their elders teach them and pointed 
ears that give them a horrible heart condition. But real evidence that 
they are of elfin descent.&quot;

Johan was broken out of his reverie when Odin said, &quot;There is one 
artifact that we found, a tablet with a decorative design on it. It was 
made completely of rubies and sapphires, carved into a smooth tablet. We 
can&#39;t determine anything about it. The colors don&#39;t appear in any kind 
of pattern. I used the White Sapphire of the Mustanen Clan--&quot;

&quot;You took Lord Blake&#39;s White Sapphire?&quot; Johan interrupted, sounding 
angered by what Odin had said.

&quot;The Clan Lords believed that it would be best to take the White 
Sapphire on the expedition and use its power to find Alvara&#39;s Cave,&quot; 
Odin explained. &quot;As I was saying, Sir Johan,&quot; the team leader continued, 
sounding irritated by Johan interrupting him, &quot;I used the White Sapphire 
of the Mustanen Clan in an attempt to activate the crystals embedded in 
the tablet. Nothing happened.&quot;

&quot;Do you think it will react to a more powerful crystal like the Red Ruby 
of Alvara?&quot; Johan asked.

&quot;That is the reason I&#39;m calling,&quot; said Odin. &quot;We want you to come back 
to Finland. Bring the Ruby and see if you can activate the tablet.&quot;

&quot;I was planning a trip to France when you called. I suppose a slight 
detour back home wouldn&#39;t hurt.&quot; Since Johan had not yet confirmed the 
flight to France, he changed his destination to Finland before he 
confirmed the itinerary.&quot;

&#39;Pierre can wait,&#39; Johan thought to himself. &#39;I must see Alvara&#39;s Cave 
for myself.&#39;

----------

Mia and Arine sat side-by-side on Arine&#39;s bed. Mia was to Arine&#39;s left 
and Arine was to Mia&#39;s right. The two girls were kissing passionately, 
their arms wrapped around each other&#39;s bodies. Arine moved her right 
hand from Mia&#39;s back around to the brunette&#39;s front and grabbed her 
lover&#39;s left breast through the fabric of her red T-shirt. Mia moaned in 
pleasure as Arine played with her breast. Mia reached for the hem of 
Arine&#39;s blue T-shirt and pulled the garment up and off of Arine, 
exposing the blonde&#39;s smaller, but perfectly shaped breasts. The shorter 
girl moved her head down and kissed the soft mounds in front of her, 
causing Arine to sigh in pleasure. However, Arine&#39;s pleasurable sighs 
turned into lustful moans as Mia started circling her tongue around the 
blonde&#39;s left nipple. She sucked the pink nubbin into her mouth and 
Arine moaned again in bliss.

Mia laughed mischievously as she pulled away from Arine just long enough 
to take off her top, exposing her own breasts to the blonde&#39;s gaze. 
Unbridled desire burning in her eyes, Arine pressed herself into Mia, 
and mashed her lips into Mia&#39;s shoving her tongue into the brunette&#39;s 
mouth. Mia sucked hungrily at Arine&#39;s tongue as her hands found Arine&#39;s 
breasts, kneading and groping the soft mounds that protruded from the 
blonde&#39;s chest.

Without breaking their lip-lock, Arine pushed Mia down onto the bed and 
lay on top of the shorter girl. She brought her right hand down to the 
top of Mia&#39;s pants and unzipped the fly. She slid her hand into the 
brunette&#39;s pants, feeling the soft warmth of her friend&#39;s mound. She 
moved her fingers across Mia&#39;s slit, feeling how moist it was. Arine 
pressed her hand against Mia&#39;s wet folds, causing the brunette to moan 
loudly in pleasure.

Desire taking over, Mia quickly unbuttoned and unzipped Arine&#39;s pants 
and started pulling them down. Arine removed herself from Mia&#39;s body 
long enough to pull her pants down and off her legs, exposing her 
completely naked body to Mia. Mia took off her pants as well, revealing 
her womanhood to the blonde. Arine lied down to Mia&#39;s left and Mia 
turned onto her side to face Arine. The two women locked their lips 
together again, savoring every sweet lick from each other&#39;s busy mouths. 
They wrapped their arms and legs around each other, pulling their bodies 
close to each other. Arine felt Mia&#39;s soft breasts pressing against her 
chest, the brunette&#39;s hard nipples digging into her flesh.

Mia turned around in Arine&#39;s arms, facing away from the blonde, allowing 
the taller girl access to her front side. As Arine suckled on the side 
of Mia&#39;s neck, she brought her right hand to Mia&#39;s right breast and 
squeezed it for all it was worth. Mia moaned in rapture as Arine held 
her nipple in between her thumb and index finger. Arine pulled on the 
erect nub with her right hand as her left hand wandered down Mia&#39;s body 
into the darkness of the brunette&#39;s nether regions. Mia moaned loudly as 
Arine started fingering her wet womanhood. Loving the sound of Mia&#39;s 
heavenly voice rife with lust, Arine dipped her fingers into her lover&#39;s 
soft folds, eliciting more aroused cries from the brunette&#39;s throat.

Mia rocked her hips madly, banging her cleft against the palm of Arine&#39;s 
left hand. Seeing that Mia was on the verge, Arine sped up her 
ministrations, ramming her fingers deep into Mia&#39;s dripping sex. The 
brunette moaned over and over again with each of Arine&#39;s thrusts into 
her canal. The pitch and volume of her moans escalated as she reached 
her peak. Arine felt the walls of Mia&#39;s vagina crush her fingers as a 
deafening cry of ecstasy escaped from Mia&#39;s lungs. The blonde could feel 
her lover&#39;s juices flowing from her opening, covering her hand in warm 
wetness as she came.

Arine&#39;s eyes hot wide open as the intensity of Mia&#39;s orgasm shook her 
out of her slumber. She found herself on the plane bound for Zurich. She 
looked to her left to see Mia sleeping peacefully in the seat next to 
her.

&quot;Arine?&quot; a voice asked from the window seat. Arine jumped at the voice 
and looked over toward the window seat to see Pierre looking at her. 
&quot;Are you all right, Arine?&quot; Pierre asked.

Still in the process of returning to reality, Arine managed to choke 
out, &quot;Yes. Yes, I&#39;m just fine, Pierre.&quot; Satisfied with Arine&#39;s response 
for the time being, Pierre simply leaned back in his seat and closed his 
eyes, trying to get as much sleep as possible before they arrived in 
Zurich.

&#39;What was that?&#39; Arine wondered. Her heart was still racing from the 
erotic, frighteningly vivid dream that she had just experienced. She 
looked at Mia&#39;s sleeping form and again felt the same feelings of lust 
and desire. Arine could feel her self-control evaporating and she knew 
that she had to distance herself from Mia before she raped the sleeping 
girl. Arine quickly unbuckled her seatbelt and retreated to the nearest 
restroom.

No sooner had Arine sat down on the toilet when her hands flew between 
her legs and started rubbing. Arine had to relieve her sexual 
frustration before she took it out on Mia. The images from the dream, 
still fresh in her mind, fueled the blonde&#39;s need for release. Arine 
rubbed her clitoris furiously, bringing herself to a mind-blowing orgasm 
in a matter of seconds. Her back arched and her body convulsed, each 
spasm accompanied by a short, soft cry. As the blonde came down from her 
orgasm, her body went limp and her torso fell forward. Arine simply hung 
on the edge of the toilet seat, catching her breath.

Arine cleaned up and walked back to her seat. Her walking was a bit 
unsteady, but she felt satisfied...for the  time being. After she had 
strapped herself in with her seat belt, Arine looked back at Mia&#39;s 
peaceful form. For the first time since they had met, Arine was unable 
to smile at seeing Mia asleep. &#39;Mia...&#39; she thought, wishing that she 
could give her girlfriend the kind of pleasure that she had felt.

----------

It was 9:44 am, European Time that the plane started its descent into 
Zurich, Switzerland. &quot;Oh, God,&quot; groaned Mia, obviously exhausted. &quot;I 
feel horrible.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure we all do,&quot; said Julia, who was sitting in the seat behind 
her.

&quot;At least you were able to sleep at all, Mia,&quot; said Sam. &quot;These 747s are 
too cramped and it was too early to sleep when we left. I didn&#39;t get any 
sleep at all!&quot;

&quot;As soon as we get to the meeting place,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;we should all 
get some rest, give our bodies some time to adjust. There are sleeping 
quarters there that will be more than sufficient.&quot;

&quot;The Clan Lords have it easy, actually living in Europe,&quot; David said, 
sitting behind Pierre. &quot;We Lancestors have our origins in England. Out 
of all the clans&#39; native countries, England is the farthest from 
Switzerland, and it&#39;s only an hour&#39;s difference. Even living on the East 
Coast doesn&#39;t help our internal clocks much.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should consider moving to Europe if another meeting comes up,&quot; 
Sam retorted. Everyone was too tired to laugh at Sam&#39;s sarcastic remark.

----------

At 9:59, a middle-aged woman with red hair waited by a limousine in the 
airport parking lot. As she scanned the people moving in and out of the 
airport, she saw six people walking toward her. She recognized the 
leader of the group as Pierre Doulin. &quot;Pierre!&quot; she called out, waving. 
&quot;Bonjour!&quot;

&quot;Bonjour, Rosette!&quot; said Pierre as they met. Pierre and Rosette lightly 
embraced each other and kissed each other&#39;s cheeks. &quot;Rosette, this is 
everyone,&quot; said Pierre, introducing the woman to the rest of the group. 
&quot;Everyone, this is my sister, Rosette.&quot;

&quot;Madame Rosette,&quot; said David, holding out his hand to the woman, &quot;Sir 
David Lancestor.&quot;

&quot;Ah yes,&quot; said Rosette, shaking David&#39;s hand, &quot;the Lancestor Clan. Nice 
to meet you, Sir David.&quot;

As David made room, Julia approached Rosette and extended her hand. 
&quot;Madame Julia Lancestor,&quot; she said, &quot;Sir David&#39;s wife.&quot;

&quot;Enchant&eacute;, Madame Julia,&quot; said Rosette, shaking Julia&#39;s hand.

&quot;Sam Lancestor,&quot; Sam introduced himself as Julia made room for him, 
&quot;David and Julia&#39;s son.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Sam,&quot; Rosette greeted him.

&quot;Mia Carver,&quot; said Mia.

Before Mia could say anything more, Rosette blurted out, &quot;The elf!&quot; The 
redheaded woman took Mia&#39;s hands in hers. &quot;I am very pleased to meet 
you, Miss Carver,&quot; said Rosette very excitedly. &quot;You do not know how 
honored we all are with your presence.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Mia said, appearing flattered.

Rosette then noticed the blonde-haired girl standing idly by, and 
released Mia&#39;s hands. &quot;And you must be Arine Sylven,&quot; said Rosette.

&quot;Yes, Madame Rosette,&quot; Arine said timidly.

Rosette held out her hand to Arine. Arine took Rosette&#39;s hand and shook 
it. &quot;Nice to meet you all,&quot; Rosette said.

&quot;And now,&quot; said Pierre just as weary as the other five travelers, &quot;if 
you don&#39;t mind, we all are in need of sleep. If we could be on our way 
as soon as possible...&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; said Rosette. With that, the six travelers and Rosette 
stepped into the back seat of the limousine. The driver drove off toward 
the meeting place.

----------

The entrance to the meeting place was a small French bakery. Rosette led 
the six travelers into the bakery. In the kitchen was a door that nobody 
except the employees and the Jewel Summoner clans knew about. Behind the 
door was an elevator that led underground. After everyone was safely in 
the elevator, Rosette pressed the button for &quot;B1&quot;. The elevator doors 
closed and the group started their journey underground.

The doors opened one floor beneath the street level. The floor that they 
were on consisted of three hallways, one leading to the left of the 
elevator, one leading right, and one leading straight ahead. Lining all 
of the hallways were doors that looked like entrances to hotel rooms. &quot;I 
will be taking my leave now,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Bonsoir.&quot; With that, Pierre 
started walking down the hall to the left.

Rosette led the other five travelers down the hall straight ahead. &quot;As 
you can expect,&quot; she said, &quot;the four Jewel Summoner clans are very 
large, so we have an entire floor reserved for residence. Sam, if your 
parents have not told you already, members of the Lancestor Clan stay in 
Quadrant C. Your parents have a room reserved for them whenever they are 
needed here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Madame Rosette,&quot; said Sam. The three Lancestors walked to 
the entrance to room C-34. David took out a key and used it to unlock 
the door.

&quot;Mia,&quot; said Rosette, &quot;since you are an honored guest in these halls, you 
can stay anywhere you like on this floor.&quot;

&quot;Anywhere as long as I can get some sleep!&quot; exclaimed the brunette.

&quot;Well,&quot; Rosette said, &quot;Sir David, Madame Julia, and Sam were the last of 
the Lancestor Clan to arrive so there are several rooms vacant in 
Quadrant C.&quot;

&quot;I suppose the room closest to Sam&#39;s,&quot; Mia said.

&quot;Very well.&quot; Rosette presented Mia with the key to room C-36. &quot;Your room 
is C-36,&quot; explained the woman, &quot;right next to Sam&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Madame Rosette,&quot; Mia said.

&quot;Thank you, Madame Rosette,&quot; Arine repeated Mia.

&quot;Sleep well, you two,&quot; said Rosette. &quot;Unless you&#39;re not up to it by 
then, the meeting will begin at eighteen hundred hours.&quot;

&quot;Six pm?&quot; asked Mia, not used to military time.

&quot;Yes, six pm,&quot; Rosette confirmed.

&quot;That should be fine,&quot; said Mia.

&quot;The meeting hall is on floor B3,&quot; Rosette said, &quot;two floors down. All 
elevators go to it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Madame Rosette,&quot; Mia and Arine said in unison. With that, 
the two friends entered their room.

&quot;Oh, boy,&quot; groaned Mia, throwing herself down on the bed on the right 
side of the room.

Arine lay down on her stomach next to Mia and draped her right arm over 
Mia&#39;s body. &quot;Sleep well, Mia,&quot; said the blonde.

&quot;Sleep well, Arine,&quot; Mia replied.

Even after they had bid each other a good sleep, Arine was restless. She 
was still troubled by the dream that she had had on the plane. Although 
she knew it was unlikely, she tried to forget about it. However, before 
she could curl up next to Mia again, Arine felt the brunette kissing her 
lips. Becoming lost in the feeling of their soft lips locking together, 
Mia and Arine wrapped their arms around each other, pulling each other 
deeper into the kiss. Mia reached for Arine&#39;s right breast and started 
fondling it, causing the blonde to moan into her mouth.

Arine could feel her nipples press against the fabric of her shirt. Mia 
reached to the hem of Arine&#39;s shirt and pulled it off, releasing the 
pressure that the garment was putting on the blonde&#39;s swollen breasts. 
Mia kissed the round globes before her, eliciting small moans from the 
blonde&#39;s mouth. Arine gasped when she felt Mia licking and sucking on 
her erect nipples.

Mia gently pushed Arine onto her back and went back to kissing her lips. 
Arine, wanting to feel Mia&#39;s warm flesh, pulled the brunette&#39;s shirt 
off. Not missing a beat, Mia went back to kissing Arine as soon as her 
slightly fuller breasts were exposed. Mia pressed herself into Arine, 
driving her own erect nipples into Arine&#39;s. Both girls moaned in bliss 
as their nipples were stimulated by the other girl&#39;s.

Mia got up from Arine&#39;s body and straddled the blonde. The brunette had 
a mischievous smile on her face that turned Arine on even more. Mia 
unbuttoned and unzipped her pants, pulling them off her legs. Mia&#39;s wet 
womanhood was just as beautiful as in Arine&#39;s dream.

As Mia went back to kissing Arine, Arine reached around the smaller 
girl&#39;s body and grasped Mia&#39;s buttocks. Mia moaned at the contact and 
then started laughing as they kissed. Mia started moving down Arine&#39;s 
body, kissing her chin, her neck, her collarbone, her cleavage. As she 
started stimulating Arine&#39;s breasts with her mouth, Mia unzipped Arine&#39;s 
pants and snuck her right hand into Arine&#39;s nether region. Arine moaned 
loudly as Mia started pleasuring her sex.

Mia continued her way down Arine&#39;s body until her face was between 
Arine&#39;s legs. Mia took off Arine&#39;s pants, revealing the blonde&#39;s aroused 
vulva, dripping with desire. Mia looked up one more time at Arine&#39;s 
face. Arine blushed with embarrassment, but showed no resistance. 
Receiving no objection from Arine, Mia took a hold on Arine&#39;s hips and 
brought her face down into Arine&#39;s mound.

Arine moaned in pleasure as she felt Mia&#39;s tongue work wonders on her 
most sensitive spot. The blonde played with her own breasts as Mia 
licked up and down her slit. Mia slipped her tongue into the blonde&#39;s 
canal and Arine started rocking her hips to her lover&#39;s ministrations, 
shoving Mia&#39;s tongue in and out of her hole.

As Arine felt her orgasm starting to build within her, she started 
thrusting her hips into Mia&#39;s face harder. Obviously noticing Arine&#39;s 
urgency, Mia started going down on Arine faster, swirling her tongue and 
lips all around Arine&#39;s vulva. Arine gripped the bed sheets to keep from 
pushing herself away from Mia&#39;s gifted mouth. The blonde clenched her 
teeth as she reached her peak, trying to hold back as long as possible. 
As soon as Mia&#39;s tongue started flicking Arine&#39;s erect clitoris, the 
blonde was rocked by a powerful orgasm. She arched her back and cried 
out in ecstasy as her orgasm rushed through her young body.

It took a minute for Arine to come back to her senses. As the blonde 
opened her eyes, she was surprised by what she saw. She found herself 
lying next Mia in the same position that they were in when they had 
entered the room. Mia was sound asleep and they were both fully clothed. 
The bedside clock read 17:35. It was 25 minutes before the meeting was 
to start.

Arine was still weak from her orgasm, so it took a lot of effort for her 
to sit up. When she got to her knees, she found that both of her legs 
were on either side of Mia&#39;s right leg. Arine looked between her legs 
and noticed that the crotch of her pants was drenched. &quot;Oh, shit!&quot; the 
blonde cried, realized that she had rubbed herself off on Mia&#39;s leg in 
her sleep. Mia murmured in her sleep. Arine froze, worried that she had 
awoken Mia. However, the blonde was relieved when Mia did not open her 
eyes. Arine quickly made her way to the adjacent bathroom to rid herself 
of the incriminating evidence.

----------

&#39;Another dream,&#39; the blonde thought to herself as she stood under the 
shower, letting the warm water calm her nerves. &#39;I don&#39;t understand,&#39; 
thought Arine. &#39;What&#39;s happening to me? I shouldn&#39;t be having these 
thoughts about Mia.&#39;

&quot;Hey, Arine,&quot; said a voice from behind the shower curtain. Arine jumped 
at the voice.

&quot;Hi, Mia,&quot; said Arine, recognizing the voice that had spoken.

&quot;Are you almost done in there?&quot; asked the brunette.

&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; Arine stammered. &quot;Almost.&quot; Arine turned the water off. 
Pulling the shower curtain back just enough to stick her head out, Arine 
asked, &quot;Mia, could you pass me a--?&quot; Arine stopped speaking dead in her 
tracks. Mia was standing before her, completely naked!

&quot;Pass you a what?&quot; Mia asked nonchalantly.

Arine&#39;s entire body turned red. She quickly closed the shower curtain 
and cried, &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry!&quot; over and over again.

Mia pulled the shower curtain open and looked Arine in the face. &quot;Sorry 
about what?&quot; the brunette asked. &quot;We&#39;ve seen each other naked before.&quot;

Arine quickly turned around, facing away from Mia. &quot;Could you pass me a 
towel, Mia?&quot; Arine asked softly.

Mia stared at her friend for a moment, trying to figure out what Arine 
was so bothered about. Without a word, Mia took a towel from the towel 
rack and handed it to Arine. Arine quickly dried herself off and then 
wrapped the towel around her body. Arine exited the bathroom, being sure 
not to lay eyes on Mia&#39;s naked form.

&#39;I can&#39;t look at Mia that way. I shouldn&#39;t,&#39; Arine told herself as she 
dressed herself in a clean set of clothes.

As Arine finished tying her shoes, Mia exited the bathroom, wrapped in a 
towel. &quot;Arine?&quot; she asked. &quot;Are you feeling all right?&quot;

Knowing that Mia had just asked a rhetorical question, Arine replied, 
&quot;Would you believe me if I said I was?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Mia said, &quot;I guess I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it right now,&quot; said the blonde, turning away 
from Mia before the brunette dropped her towel in order to get dressed.

&quot;Is there a time that you might want to tell me?&quot; asked Mia.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Arine replied. &quot;Maybe. Just not now.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Mia said, honoring her girlfriend&#39;s wishes. &quot;The meeting starts 
in a few minutes. Shall we go?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Arine. Now fully dressed, Mia picked up the room key that 
was lying on the desk next to the bed. She and Arine exited the room and 
walked to the elevator.

----------

When Mia and Arine got off the elevator at floor B3, they found 
themselves in front of a long hallway that led straight ahead. They 
walked down the hallway, which led to a door, which was probably the 
entrance to the meeting room. As they walked through the door, the two 
girls found themselves in a large, square shaped room. The room was 
filled with many people, probably from the four Jewel Summoner Clans.

It seemed that each Jewel Summoner Clan sat at a particular side of the 
room. At one of the four sides were seated Clan members with hair color 
ranging from brown to brownish-red. Mia and Arine knew that it was the 
Doulin Clan because Pierre was one of the members sitting on that side 
of the room.

At another side of the room were members with mostly blond hair, but a 
few people had darker hair. Another side had members with hair that had 
a small range between light brown and dark blond.

The fourth side of the room had members with very dark hair. What stood 
out from that side of the room was that Sam was waving to the girls. Mia 
and Arine walked toward Sam, knowing that the Lancestor Clan sat at that 
side of the room.

&quot;Rest well?&quot; Sam asked as the couple sat down beside him.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Mia sighed. &quot;I feel much better.&quot; The brunette turned to Arine 
and said, &quot;What about you, Arine?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Arine said blandly. &quot;I slept well.&quot; Mia had a worried expression 
on her face, but did not nag at Arine to tell her what was wrong.

Just then, four elderly people, one from each side of the room, rose 
from their seats. &quot;The Clan Leaders!&quot; Sam exclaimed as he saw the four 
people made their way to the center of the room.

&quot;Bonsoir, buonasera, god dag, good evening,&quot; the woman from the 
Lancestor Clan said.

&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; said the man from the Doulin Clan. &quot;For 
those of you who do not know us, I am Lord Felix of the Doulin Clan...&quot;

&quot;...I am Lord Giovanni of the Valentino Clan...&quot; said the man from the 
brown-haired clan.

&quot;...I am Lady Fredrika of the Dagomar Clan...&quot; the woman from the 
mostly-blond-haired clan said.

&quot;...And I am Lady Alana of the Lancestor Clan,&quot; said the first woman who 
had spoken.

&quot;We know that many of you have come to us from around the world,&quot; said 
Lord Giovanni. He had a very noticeable Italian accent in his voice. 
&quot;Most of you would probably prefer to be back home, enjoying your lives. 
However, we have now reached a turning point in our world&#39;s history.&quot;

With an obvious French accent, Lord Felix said, &quot;The elf has been 
found.&quot; Many of the Clan Members murmured at Felix&#39;s statement. &quot;The 
Blue Sapphire of Alvara has activated, indicating that the elf has 
awoken. However, according to Sir Pierre Doulin, the elf&#39;s powers have 
not been fully realized yet.&quot;

&quot;Fifteen centuries ago,&quot; said Lady Alana in a British accent, &quot;our 
ancestors slaughtered all of the pureblooded elves. Finally, after 
fifteen hundred years, we Jewel Summoners have a chance to make things 
right again. The Lancestor Clan has gathered information over many 
decades that leads us to believe that the Red Ruby of Alvara and the 
Blue Sapphire of Alvara are the keys to unlocking the elf&#39;s hidden 
powers.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Lady Fredrika said with a Nordic accent, &quot;the Red Ruby 
of Alvara is missing. The Dagomar Clan was charged with the duty of 
protecting the Ruby. However, twenty years ago, the Ruby was given to 
young Madame Erika Dagomar. For years we have tried to find Madame 
Erika, but have had no success.&quot;

It was at that time that Pierre stood up. &quot;Sir Pierre Doulin,&quot; said 
Felix, indicating that Pierre had permission to speak.

&quot;I know the whereabouts of the Red Ruby of Alvara,&quot; Pierre said. Again, 
the convention murmured. Pierre continued, &quot;Only recently have I 
discovered that one, Johan Mustanen, possesses the Ruby. How he attained 
possession of the Ruby, I do no know.&quot;

&quot;Can you draw any connection between this Johan Mustanen and Madame 
Erika?&quot; asked Fredrika.

&quot;Johan expressed adamant hatred for the Dagomar Clan,&quot; Pierre explained. 
&quot;When I mentioned the name &#39;Dagomar&#39; to him three days ago, he used the 
power of the Ruby against me.&quot; Touching the cast that his leg was 
wrapped in, he said, &quot;This broken leg is the result of Johan&#39;s assault.&quot;

&quot;Johan was able to use the Ruby&#39;s power?&quot; a surprised Lord Giovanni 
asked.

&quot;He is a descendant of the elves,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I believe that the 
Mustanen Clan&#39;s origins lie in the human-elf hybrids that existed nine 
thousand years ago. Somehow, the knowledge of their origins has remained 
intact through the millennia.&quot;

&quot;You say that Johan showed adamant hatred for the Dagomar Clan,&quot; said 
Felix.

&quot;Perhaps Johan encountered Madame Erika some time ago,&quot; Alana suggested 
a possibility. &quot;Erika did something to profoundly upset Johan, so he 
attacked Erika and took the Ruby from her.&quot;

An elderly man from the Dagomar Clan stood up. &quot;Lord Sven Dagomar,&quot; said 
Lady Fredrika.

&quot;I believe that I may have encountered Johan twenty years ago,&quot; the man 
said.

Pierre spun his head toward Sven, surprised by his statement. &quot;You did?&quot; 
the professor asked.

Sven asked, &quot;Does he have somewhat long, silver hair, blue eyes? About 
mid-thirties?&quot;

&quot;That sounds like Johan Mustanen to me!&quot; Pierre exclaimed.

&quot;Twenty years ago,&quot; Sven told the story, &quot;I received a message from 
Madame Erika though the pyrite crystal that I carried. The message 
conveyed that she was under attack in northern Finland. I and other 
members of the Dagomar Clan went in to rescue her. When we found Madame 
Erika, she was being attacked by a young man, who was in his mid-teens 
at the time, with long, silver hair and blue eyes. We rescued Erika, but 
she had been choked to near-asphyxiation. We used quartz crystal to help 
her recover. Madame Erika should have remained in bed for several weeks 
to recover from a respiratory infection that she contracted, but she 
insisted on fleeing. She said that Johan would not stop hunting her. She 
took the Red Ruby and fled, knowing that Johan would most likely use a 
sapphire or ruby of his own to track the Red Ruby&#39;s movements. She did 
it to protect the Dagomar Clan.&quot;

&quot;It seems that Johan caught up to Madame Erika along the way,&quot; Fredrika 
said.

&quot;Do you know how long Madame Erika had the Red Ruby of Alvara before 
Johan gained possession of it?&quot; Alana asked.

&quot;No, Lady Alana,&quot; said Sven, sitting down again.

&quot;Sir Pierre?&quot; Felix asked.

&quot;No, Lord Felix,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;I only encountered the Ruby three days 
ago.&quot; Pierre sat down.

&quot;We must retrieve the Red Ruby from Johan,&quot; Alana said. &quot;Only with the 
Ruby can the elf fully awaken.&quot;

A young woman from the Valentino Clan stood up. &quot;Madame Alessandra 
Valentino,&quot; Giovanni said.

&quot;How do you propose we retrieve the Ruby from Johan?&quot; asked the woman.

&quot;If it comes to it,&quot; said Lord Giovanni, &quot;with spinel.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be suggesting that we use force against Johan,&quot; Alessandra 
said, her voice beginning to rise. &quot;Our ancestors destroyed the elves 
fifteen hundred years ago and now we have to attack elves again?&quot;

&quot;The entire point of retrieving the Ruby is for the elves,&quot; Giovanni 
rebutted. &quot;The new age cannot begin without the ruby&#39;s power. If Johan 
cannot understand that, we must use whatever force is necessary to take 
back the Ruby of Alvara from him.&quot;

As Alessandra sat, a man from the Lancestor clan stood up. &quot;Sir Gabriel 
Lancestor,&quot; Alana said the man&#39;s name.

The man spoke, &quot;Our information to date suggests that the Red Ruby and 
Blue Sapphire of Alvara are the keys to unlocking the elf&#39;s power. Does 
anyone know exactly how that is to be accomplished?&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately no,&quot; Alana replied. &quot;More research is needed. And there 
is no way of knowing how much more research is needed.&quot;

Lord Felix then said, &quot;But the Prophecy of Awakening states that once 
the elf completely awakens, the new age of the elves will begin. The elf 
has begun to awaken, which means that the Prophecy will come to pass 
most likely within your lifetime.&quot; Gabriel sat down.

&quot;Does anyone else wish to speak?&quot; Felix asked. Nobody spoke for several 
seconds, indicating that there was nothing more for the Clan Members to 
say. &quot;Bon,&quot; Felix said. &quot;Now that our exchange of information has been 
completed, it is time to present...&quot; Gesturing toward the Lancestor 
Clan, Felix finished his sentence, &quot;...the elf.&quot; Mia rose from her seat 
next to Sam. All of the Clan Members in the room looked at Mia with awe. 
&quot;Come here, my child,&quot; said Felix, holding out his hand toward Mia. All 
eyes were on Mia as the 19-year-old walked to the center of the room. 
Felix gently touched Mia&#39;s face and then brushed her brown hair away, 
revealing the pointed ears that Mia carried. &quot;Mia Carver indeed is a 
descendant of the elves. Her pointed ears are proof of that.&quot; Felix 
looked into Mia&#39;s face and said, &quot;Mia Carver, it is you that are 
destined to bring about the new age of the elves.&quot;

Felix then reached into his pocket and pulled out a crystal that was the 
deepest blue Mia had ever seen. &quot;For fifteen hundred years,&quot; Felix told 
the story, &quot;the Doulin Clan has been charged with protecting this 
crystal. The time has come to give it back to its people. Mia Carver, I 
present to you the Blue Sapphire of Alvara. May it grant you the power 
to guide your people into the future.&quot; Felix held out the Blue Sapphire 
of Alvara to Mia and she took it. The convention applauded as the 
Sapphire was given back to the elf.

However, as quickly as the applause started, the room suddenly fell 
silent. Many of the Clan Members looked at the Sapphire with looks of 
confusion on their faces. Sam looked around the room, wondering what had 
the Clan Members so confused. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he asked Arine, hoping 
that she might have an answer.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Arine replied, just as confused as Sam.

&quot;Is something supposed to happen?&quot; Mia asked Lord Felix.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Felix said. &quot;The Sapphire should be reacting to 
your touch.&quot;

It was then that Sam&#39;s father stood. &quot;Sir David Lancestor,&quot; Alana said.

&quot;The Red Ruby of Alvara is also needed to awaken the elf&#39;s powers, is it 
not?&quot; David asked.

&quot;It is needed to awaken the elf&#39;s powers, yes,&quot; Felix replied. &quot;But we 
still should see some kind of reaction.&quot; Pierre stood up. &quot;Sir Pierre 
Doulin,&quot; said Felix.

&quot;The time has not yet come,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Mia is still discovering her 
powers. When she has learned to use them, I am sure the Blue Sapphire of 
Alvara will activate.&quot;

The four Clan Leaders turned to each other and whispered things to each 
other. After they had turned back to the convention, Felix said, &quot;We 
have no choice but to accept that possibility.&quot; Pierre and David sat 
down. &quot;Does anyone else wish to speak?&quot; Again, nobody spoke up. 
&quot;Excellent. We will reconvene tomorrow at eighteen hundred hours. There 
will be a promotion ceremony at ten hundred hours tomorrow morning. This 
hearing is adjourned.&quot;

With that, all of the Clan Members stood and started talking amongst 
themselves. Mia stepped down from the center of the room and walked to 
Arine. &quot;What do you think?&quot; the brunette asked cheerfully, holding the 
Blue Sapphire of Alvara in her hand.

&quot;It&#39;s a very beautiful crystal,&quot; said Arine, looking into the Blue 
Sapphire.

&quot;I think it would look great as a pendant,&quot; Mia said. She then asked, 
&quot;You want to hold it?&quot;

&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Arine, feeling a little overwhelmed by Mia&#39;s question, &quot;I 
couldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Mia asked. &quot;It matches your eyes perfectly.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your sapphire, Mia,&quot; Arine replied. &quot;I don&#39;t deserve something as 
important as that.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Mia asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sure.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; With that, Mia put the crystal in her pants pocket. &quot;Shall we?&quot; 
she asked, holding out her elbow toward Arine. Arine held Mia&#39;s arm in 
her hand and the two started walking back to their room.

----------

Meanwhile, the Mustanen Clan was reconvening in their meeting room in 
Finland. High-ranking Clan Members again sat around the large, round, 
dimly-lit table. &quot;Sir Johan,&quot; said Lord Odin. &quot;I trust you flight home 
was without incident?&quot;

&quot;It was, Milord,&quot; Johan replied.

&quot;Have you brought the Red Ruby of Alvara back with you?&quot; the female Clan 
Lord asked.

&quot;Yes, Milord,&quot; replied Johan.

&quot;Madame Annika,&quot; said another male Clan Lord, &quot;bring forth the tablet.&quot; 
Annika stood from her seat and passed the multi-colored crystal tablet 
into the bright light at the center of the table. &quot;Sir Johan?&quot; the Clan 
Lord said.

Johan held the Red Ruby of Alvara over the tablet. Johan tapped into the 
power of the Ruby and it started glowing red. Reacting to the power of 
the Ruby, the crystals in the tablet started glowing different colors. 
The Clan Members stared in awe at the image that the tablet revealed. 
&quot;Who is that?&quot; one of the Clan Members wondered.

Where the other Clan Members had looks of intrigue and curiosity on 
their faces, Johan&#39;s expression was one of absolute shock. &quot;Impossible!&quot; 
he cried.
