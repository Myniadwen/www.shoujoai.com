<h1>Birthright (part 10 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mascots/birthrite-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>It was a dark, brooding night. Most of the lights in Zurich were turned 
off, as if the residents of the city were hiding from Arine and Johan&#39;s 
eminent attack. Leading the way, Arine used the power of the Blue 
Sapphire of Alvara to light their path. &quot;How much farther is it?&quot; Johan 
asked, obviously anxious to take his revenge on the Jewel Summoners.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Johan,&quot; Arine assured the man. &quot;We&#39;ll be there soon 
enough.&quot;

At the French bakery, Jewel Summoners started pouring out of the secret 
elevator, ready to take in Arine upon her return. The leader of the 
retrieval team went to the door, unlocked it, and opened it. Standing in 
the doorway was a seemingly unharmed Arine Sylven. &quot;Miss Arine,&quot; said 
the team leader. &quot;Thank goodness you&#39;re all right.&quot; Arine simply stared 
at the Jewel Summoners, her expression full of malicious intent. Behind 
Arine, a tall, dark figure emerged from the darkness, his face bearing 
an evil grin.

----------

Sam, Pierre, and Yvette waited as the elevator ascended from floor B3. 
As the elevator doors opened, they saw that Felix, Giovanni, Fredrika, 
and Alana were standing in the elevator. &quot;Lady Alana,&quot; said Sam, bowing 
slightly to his Clan Leader.

&quot;Lord Felix,&quot; said Pierre, bowing as well.

&quot;Uh, bonjour,&quot; said Yvette, waving nervously. Sam, Pierre, and Yvette 
entered the elevator. The doors closed and the elevator continued its 
ascent toward ground level.

&quot;This is very fortunate,&quot; said Giovanni. &quot;We do not have to send anyone 
to retrieve the elf.&quot;

&quot;None of the Jewel Summoners have to put themselves in harm&#39;s way,&quot; 
Alana added.

Suddenly, a strange expression came across Fredrika&#39;s and Felix&#39;s faces. 
It was a look of confusion and a feeling of impending danger. &quot;Lord 
Felix?&quot; Pierre asked.

&quot;Lady Fredrika?&quot; Sam asked behind Pierre.

&quot;Something is wrong,&quot; Fredrika sensed.

&quot;It&#39;s not only the Sapphire,&quot; said Felix. &quot;There&#39;s something else.&quot;

A look of horror came across Fredrika&#39;s face as she realized what it 
was. &quot;It&#39;s the Ruby!&quot; she cried.

The elevator doors opened at ground level just as the other Jewel 
Summoners in the elevator realized the danger that they were in. Now at 
the top floor, they were straight in Johan and Arine&#39;s path! Sam cried 
out, &quot;Yvette, get down!&quot;

The Red Ruby in Johan&#39;s hand glowed red and fired a great force, 
throwing the Jewel Summoners of the retrieval team flying. Sam and the 
Clan Leaders dodged out of the way while Pierre grabbed Yvette and 
brought her out of the way before a Jewel Summoner flew headlong into 
the elevator. With Yvette out of harm&#39;s way, Pierre frantically tapped 
the &quot;Close&quot; button.

As Arine and Johan attacked and killed the rest of the retrieval team, 
Johan happened to see his old &quot;friend&quot; in the elevator. &quot;Pierre,&quot; he 
said as the doors closed. Arine made a dash for the elevator, hoping to 
press the &quot;Down&quot; button before the doors closed. However, she was too 
late. The elevator was already descending by the time she pressed the 
button. &quot;Damn it!&quot; Johan seethed as he approached Arine. &quot;They got 
away.&quot;

&quot;Not to worry,&quot; the blonde said. &quot;The elevator will come back.&quot;

Meanwhile, Giovanni pulled out an amethyst crystal to tend to the 
injured Jewel Summoner that was thrown into the elevator.

&quot;What the hell was Arine doing with Johan?&quot; Sam asked frantically.

&quot;Why would Arine turn on us?&quot; Pierre wondered with equal bewilderment.

&quot;We must warn the others,&quot; said Felix. Felix, Fredrika, and Alana pulled 
out pyrite crystals to warn the other members of their clans.

As Giovanni&#39;s amethyst stopped glowing over the injured Jewel Summoner, 
a somber expression came across his face. &quot;He&#39;s dead,&quot; Giovanni said. 
&quot;There&#39;s nothing I could do.&quot; Giovanni stood and took out his own pyrite 
crystal to warn the other members of the Valentino Clan of the attack on 
their headquarters that had just begun.

As they reached floor B1, several other Jewel Summoners joined them in 
the elevator. &quot;We got your message, Milords,&quot; one of the Jewel Summoners 
said. &quot;Everyone is evacuating to floor B4.&quot; The elevator doors closed 
and the Jewel Summoners continued their descent.

----------

Meanwhile, Johan was losing his patience. &quot;What is taking that elevator 
so damn long?&quot; he asked.

&quot;For the elevator to take this long,&quot; said Arine, &quot;it&#39;s either being 
held up or it&#39;s going to the bottom floor.&quot; Arine could sense Johan&#39;s 
frustration. &quot;I can tell you&#39;re impatient.&quot; Looking back at the 
elevator, she added, &quot;So am I.&quot; Tapping into her elfin strength, Arine 
balled her fist and knocked the elevator doors down with a single punch. 
The two elfin descendants looked down the elevator shaft. &quot;If I were 
escaping to a lower level,&quot; said Arine, &quot;what would I do with the 
elevators?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Johan suggested, &quot;If I were escaping to a lower level, I would 
do all I could to keep my pursuers from getting to me.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re holding up the elevators,&quot; Arine realized. &quot;No matter.&quot; Arine 
jumped from the ledge, grabbed on to the elevator cable, and started 
sliding down like a firefighter sliding down the pole to get to his 
vehicle. Johan jumped for the cable as well and slid down after Arine.

----------

The elevator arrived at floor B4. Sam, Pierre, Yvette, the Clan Leaders, 
and the other Jewel Summoners that they had picked up exited the 
elevator. Yvette, Pierre, and the lower-level Jewel Summoners ran down 
the corridors of floor B4 while the Clan Leaders stayed behind. Holding 
up their glowing pyrite crystals, they contacted each of the Jewel 
Summoners that were not part of the retrieval team. &quot;Good,&quot; said 
Fredrika. &quot;Everyone&#39;s out.&quot;

Giovanni, Felix, and Alana ran down the halls of floor B4 to get to the 
other three elevators. As soon as each Clan Leader was on one of the 
elevators, they all pressed the red buttons beside the doors, each one 
reading &quot;Seal Off Floors&quot;.

----------

As Arine and Johan slid down the cable, they saw a floor open up from 
the walls directly below them! As they set foot on the ground that had 
suddenly appeared, they looked up and saw a ceiling extend directly 
below the ground floor. &quot;They sealed off the floors?&quot; Johan said, 
amazed.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know they had that option,&quot; said Arine.

&quot;Where are we?&quot; the Finn asked.

&quot;We seem to be at floor B1,&quot; the blonde replied, &quot;just below ground 
level. The lowest level is B4, three floors below us.&quot;

&quot;Is there any other way down?&quot; Johan asked. Arine held the Blue Sapphire 
of Alvara in her hand and pointed it toward the ground. The Sapphire 
started glowing blue and Arine threw a powerful force toward the ground. 
When the blast dissipated, the floor was dented, but unbroken. &quot;Shit,&quot; 
Johan said. &quot;It only left a dent.&quot;

&quot;I know there&#39;s another way down,&quot; said Arine. &quot;The Jewel Summoners 
wouldn&#39;t have sealed themselves in without an escape route back to the 
surface. We just have to find that route.&quot;

----------

Sam, Yvette, and Pierre continued their way through the corridors of the 
lowest level of the compound. As they walked, they came across a small 
band of Jewel Summoners, carrying Mia. &quot;Mia!&quot; said Sam, rushing to his 
friend. Sam and Mia embraced, thankful that they were all right.

&quot;Sam,&quot; Mia asked, &quot;what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Trust me,&quot; said Sam, &quot;you don&#39;t want to know.&quot;

&quot;Please Sam,&quot; Mia demanded, &quot;I have to know. Where&#39;s Arine.&quot;

Sam had a solemn expression on his face. &quot;It seems,&quot; he explained, 
&quot;she&#39;s sided with Johan.&quot;

Mia&#39;s eyes widened with fear. &quot;What?&quot; she stammered. &quot;No. She wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Arine and Johan have already killed everyone on the ground floor,&quot; 
Pierre said. &quot;I know it&#39;s hard to believe, but Arine has turned on us!&quot;

&quot;Stop it!&quot; cried Mia hysterically. &quot;You&#39;re lying!&quot;

&quot;Mia, calm down,&quot; said Sam. The boy held Mia tightly and kept talking. 
&quot;I won&#39;t let anything happen to you. I will protect you, no matter what. 
I&#39;ll make sure you survive, even if it costs me my life.&quot;

As Sam spoke, Mia calmed down, her heart rate slowing to normal. &quot;Thank 
you, Sam,&quot; she said weakly, before collapsing. Sam grabbed Mia and kept 
her from falling to the floor.

Yvette went to Sam and helped him carry Mia. &quot;We have to get Mia to the 
Array before Johan and Arine find it,&quot; Sam said.

&quot;We can&#39;t,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;It&#39;s too dangerous. In her weakened state, Mia 
could be killed.&quot; Sam and Yvette both looked at Pierre, worried for Mia.

----------

Arine aimed the Sapphire toward the elevator doors and used the 
crystal&#39;s power to knock down the doors. Arine and Johan walked onto 
floor B1, thinking about how the Jewel Summoners would try to evacuate 
the compound. &quot;How would the Jewel Summoners escape from four floors 
below the ground?&quot; Johan wondered.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the blonde replied. &quot;They never informed me of what kind 
of escape route they had.&quot;

&quot;Could it be a tunnel of some kind? A staircase that leads to the 
outskirts of Zurich?&quot;

&quot;My senses tell me that it&#39;s something more elaborate. More likely it&#39;s 
some kind of conveyer system. Possibly involving crystals.&quot;

&quot;What kind of crystals can convey solid matter?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Arine started listing the possibilities, &quot;apatite has the power 
of location. It has the ability to pull Jewel Summoners in the direction 
that they want to go. Spinel has the ability to create physical 
manifestations. Jewel Summoners have used spinel to summon vehicles. 
Corundum can alter an object&#39;s velocity and trajectory, but only elves 
can use the power of corundum.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not entirely true,&quot; Johan said. &quot;Remember what I told you about 
Erika Dagomar and my brother?&quot; Arine nodded. &quot;Well, after she killed 
Rikhard, Erika tried to escape. She fled out of the household where 
several other members of the Dagomar clan arrived on their spinel 
vehicles. I was using my brother&#39;s white sapphire against the Jewel 
Summoners. I thought I had the upper hand, but one of the Jewel 
Summoners used the Red Ruby of Alvara to counteract the effects of 
Rikhard&#39;s sapphire. They may not know how to use the full power of 
corundum like the elves do, but they were in possession of the Red Ruby 
and Blue Sapphire of Alvara for fifteen hundred years. After fifteen 
hundred years of training, they have realized some minimal ability to 
use corundum.&quot;

&quot;Could the Jewel Summoners possibly use corundum to help escape?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps, if they knew enough about it to use it effectively.&quot;

----------

Sam and Yvette brought Mia to the emergency shelter on floor B4 and lay 
her down on one of the mattresses that they kept there. &quot;Mia should be 
fine here for the time being,&quot; said Sam. &quot;Come on. We should meet up 
with the rest of the Jewel Summoners.&quot;

As Sam and Yvette made their way to the secondary meeting room on that 
floor, Mia regained consciousness. &#39;Arine,&#39; the brunette wondered, 
&#39;Why?&#39;

----------

All of the Jewel Summoners quickly convened at the secondary meeting 
room. &quot;My friends,&quot; said Alana, &quot;the Clan Leaders and I must admit that 
we have made a critical error. We did not anticipate all things that 
could have occurred. We assumed that Arine had escaped. We were wrong.&quot;

&quot;But we do not have the time to mourn our fallen comrades,&quot; said Felix. 
&quot;Right now, we must decide whether to use the Array. We believe that 
after fifteen hundred years, we Jewel Summoners have learned enough to 
use the device effectively.&quot;

&quot;It may be painful for people sent through the Array,&quot; Fredrika 
explained. &quot;It does involve the deconstruction and reconstruction of 
matter, which makes it the most dangerous device that the Jewel 
Summoners have ever created. If we send ourselves through the Array, we 
will most likely be weakened when we emerge on the other side.&quot;

&quot;However,&quot; Giovanni continued, &quot;I do not believe we have another choice. 
The elevators are too dangerous since Arine and Johan are most likely 
waiting for us. The only other way out is through the Array. The longer 
we wait, the more time Johan and Arine have to discover the Array. If 
they learn enough about it, they may be able to use it to get to the 
lower levels. We must decide whether to use the Array to escape or to 
stay behind and fight.&quot;

Sam rose from where he was sitting. &quot;Sir Samuel Lancestor,&quot; said Alana.

&quot;We can&#39;t use the Array,&quot; the young Jewel Summoner said. &quot;Mia is 
extremely weak. She won&#39;t be able to survive a trip through the Array.&quot;

&quot;Do you have an alternative, Sir Samuel?&quot; Alana asked.

&quot;We need someone to stay with Mia to help her get back to the surface 
another way,&quot; said Sam.

Pierre then stood. &quot;Lord Pierre Doulin,&quot; Felix announced.

&quot;We should send everyone through the Array that we can,&quot; Pierre said. 
&quot;The Clan Leaders have to stay behind until the last minute anyway to 
control the Array. Once everyone else is out, the Clan Leaders can 
reactivate the elevators just long enough to get to the top with Mia. If 
your timing is perfect, you might be able to get past Johan while he is 
far away from the elevator.&quot;

&quot;It is a dangerous tactic,&quot; Fredrika said.

Alana then said, &quot;But Arine and Johan certainly would not be expecting 
it.&quot;

&quot;But what about the elf&#39;s powers?&quot; asked Felix. &quot;Now that she has 
awoken, she has the ability to sense our thoughts. Once we reactivate 
the elevators, they may be ready for us.&quot;

&quot;Leave the elf to us,&quot; said Giovanni. &quot;The Valentinos will use 
orthoclase to mask our presence. Orthoclase may only have a hardness of 
six, but with any luck, it will be enough to keep us from detection.&quot; 
Sam and Pierre sat down.

&quot;Does anyone else wish to speak?&quot; asked Fredrika. &quot;Alright,&quot; she said 
after a brief pause. &quot;Let&#39;s move! Everyone, get to the Array.&quot; With 
that, all of the Jewel Summoners stood and started making their way to 
the center of floor B4.

----------

Meanwhile, Arine and Johan were still brainstorming. As they racked 
their brains for any possibilities, Arine had an idea. &quot;I just had a 
thought,&quot; she said.

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; inquired Johan, listening intently.

&quot;I just remembered something I saw in my vision of Olivia,&quot; Arine 
explained. &quot;In order for Olivia to escape, Alvara used the Ruby and the 
Sapphire to send Olivia far away. Olivia was sent through the roof of 
Alvara&#39;s Cave and landed at least a hundred meters from where she 
emerged.&quot;

&quot;Are you saying that Olivia&#39;s body passed through the roof of the cave? 
That she passed through solid matter?&quot;

&quot;That is certainly a good possibility.&quot;

&quot;Could the Jewel Summoners have found a way to send objects through 
solid matter like Alvara did?&quot;

&quot;Maybe that&#39;s their escape route.&quot;

&quot;But they are simply humans. They cannot use that power at will. They 
must have some kind of device set up in order to harness that ability. 
Where would they set up such a device?&quot;

Just as Johan finished asking the question, there was a flash of light 
from the center of the floor. Johan and Arine looked at each other for a 
moment and then ran down the hallway that led to the center of the 
floor. They arrived at the place where the hallway intersected with 
three others, one leading left, another leading right, and the third 
leading straight ahead to the other side of the floor. It was the center 
of floor B1. &quot;Where did that flash come from?&quot; Arine wondered.

Johan then looked at the ground and noticed a complex pattern of 
different colored crystals in the very center of the floor. &quot;Arine, have 
a look at this.&quot;

Arine looked at the arrangement. The pattern was complex, with the 
crystals closest to the center of the arrangement arranged in a large 
circle. &quot;What is it?&quot; Arine asked.

&quot;It&#146;s some kind of arrangement of crystals,&quot; said Johan. &quot;It&#39;s not all 
that dissimilar from the arrangement of white sapphires in the machine 
that I used to identify your powers.&quot;

&quot;Those green crystals look like apatite,&quot; said Arine. &quot;The red ones look 
like spinel. And the others ones...&quot; Arine took a moment to try to 
identify the other crystals besides apatite and spinel.

&quot;My god,&quot; said Johan. &quot;They&#146;re corundum.&quot;

&quot;So the Jewel Summoners HAVE found out how to use corundum!&quot; Arine 
walked into the middle of the circle to inspect the arrangemet. &quot;But 
what would these crystals be doing in this kind of arrangement at the 
center of the floor?&quot; she wondered.

Just then, the crystals started glowing. A beam of white light extended 
from the floor, corresponding to the positions of the innermost 
crystals. The beam completely surrounded Arine as she looked around, 
wondering exactly what was going on. Then a bright flash came from the 
ground, flying upwards and to the ceiling. Arine cried out in pain as 
the flash went through her. As the flash subsided and the beam 
disappeared, Arine collapsed to the ground. &quot;Arine!&quot; cried Johan, 
rushing to the girl&#39;s side. &quot;Arine,&quot; he asked. &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Help me,&quot; said Arine, as if she felt like she would die from the pain 
throughout her body.

&quot;Arine, snap out of it!&quot; cried Johan. Arine opened her eyes and looked 
at the man. &quot;Please,&quot; Johan said again. &quot;Tell me what happened.&quot;

&quot;It felt like a hundred swords passing through me at the same time,&quot; was 
the best way for Arine to describe the sensation. &quot;As if hundreds of 
sharp objects impaled me through the floor and passed through me upward 
to the ceiling.&quot;

&quot;I sensed an unusual form pf mystical energy at the time of the white 
flash,&quot; Johan said. &quot;I felt mystical energies from the apatite, spinel, 
and corundum spiraling around one another. A funnel of mystical energy 
surrounded the arrangement of crystals, as if meant to convey something 
upward.&quot; It was then that Johan had a realization. &quot;This must be the 
escape device,&quot; he said. &quot;An intricate arrangement of crystals meant to 
transport people upward through the floors, through the ground, through 
solid matter up to the surface.&quot; Another beam of white light came from 
the center of the floor. After the beam stayed unchanged for several 
seconds, another bright flash came from the beam and the beam 
disappeared. &quot;Each one of those bright flashes must be a Jewel Summoner 
being sent through the conveyer,&quot; said Johan.

&quot;Be sure not to stand in the center of that arrangement when an object 
is sent through it,&quot; warned Arine. &quot;It has a disruptive effect on solid 
matter. I doubt the Jewel Summoners felt it as profoundly as I did since 
they were not completely solid when they were sent through the 
conveyer.&quot;

&quot;If the converyer can send people to the surface,&quot; Johan wondered, 
&quot;could others pass through it the other way as well?&quot; Another beam of 
light appeared. &quot;Wait here,&quot; Johan said. &quot;Regain your strength. I want 
to try something.&quot; Johan walked toward the beam and held out the Ruby. 
Johan tapped into the Ruby&#39;s power and the crystal started glowing red. 
When the bright flash came again, Johan disrupted the power of the 
corundum crystals of the arrangement, causing the Jewel Summoner in the 
conveyer to rematerialize before he passed through the ceiling. Instead, 
he was slammed against the ceiling and fell to the floor as the beam 
disappeared.

The Jewel Summoner groaned in pain and then looked up at Johan standing 
over him. &quot;Hello there,&quot; said Johan, looking down at the Jewel Summoner. 
Johan swung the Ruby around, throwing a powerful force at the Jewel 
Summoner, sending him flying away and slamming him against the edge of 
where two of the hallways intersected. &quot;If I can manipulate the corundum 
in this arrangement,&quot; Johan said, &quot;it loses some of its efficiency at it 
can&#39;t send the Jewel Summoners through the ceiling.&quot;

Arine, quickly recovering from her encounter with the conveyer, stood up 
and walked beside Johan. As the beam appeared again, Arine attempted 
what Johan ad just done. The Sapphire of Alvara glowed blue in Arine&#39;s 
hand, and another Jewel Summoner rematerialized with the bright flash, 
hitting hard against the ceiling. As the Jewel Summoner fell toward the 
ground, Arine kicked the Jewel Summoner in mid air, sending him against 
the opposite edge of the intersecting hallways. Johan and Arine smiled 
at each other, amused as if playing a game of Whack-a-Mole...with the 
Jewel Summoners as the moles.

----------

Meanwhile, in the emergency shelter, Mia had managed to sit up onto her 
knees. The brunette looked toward the ground, confused, frightened, and 
saddened by what was happening. &#39;Arine,&#39; she wondered. &#39;Why are you 
doing this? What has Johan done to you to make you turn on us?&#39;

----------

On the roof of the French bakery, the Jewel Summoners that had made it 
through the conveyer were waiting for their next comrade to 
rematerialize in front of them. &quot;Something is wrong,&quot; one of the Jewel 
Summoners said. &quot;How long has it been since the last one of us got up 
here?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s been about two minutes I think,&quot; said another Jewel Summoner.

&quot;We&#39;ve been coming in intervals of about thirty seconds,&quot; said the first 
Jewel Summoner. &quot;Why haven&#39;t any others come?&quot;

The second Jewel Summoner pulled out a pyrite crystal and used it to 
contact the Clan Leaders. At that time, the Clan Leaders were surrounded 
around a large arrangement of crystals on floor B4, about to send 
another Jewel Summoner through the Array. The crystals of the Array 
started glowing, sending off individual beams of light, which started 
spiraling around one another, reinforcing one another, climbing into a 
single pillar of white light, surrounding the female Jewel Summoner that 
was standing in the Array.

Just then, the Clan Leaders sensed something. They stood up, letting the 
power of the Array die down, and took out their pyrite crystals. The 
crystals were glowing yellow. &quot;Merde!&quot; Felix cursed.

&quot;What is it, Milords?&quot; asked the Jewel Summoner standing in the Array.

&quot;The last five that we sent through the Array haven&#39;t arrived at the 
surface,&quot; said Alana.

&quot;It seems,&quot; Giovanni realized, &quot;that Johan and Arine have found the 
Array and are disrupting the mystical energies that make the Array 
effective.&quot;

&quot;I fear they will soon discover how to use the Array and will find their 
way down here,&quot; Fredrika sighed.

&quot;Step out of the Array, Madame Chloe,&quot; Felix said. Following her Clan 
Leader&#39;s orders, the Jewel Summoner stepped out of the Array and joined 
the other Jewel Summoners gathered around it.

&quot;Options?&quot; Alana asked.

&quot;We can&#39;t use the Array,&quot; said Giovanni. &quot;We can&#39;t use the elevators. 
Maybe staying and fighting is our only option left.&quot;

&quot;Everyone,&quot; Felix commanded, &quot;stand around the Array. Prepare 
yourselves.&quot; All of the Jewel Summoners took out their spinel crystals 
and aimed them at the Array, ready to attack whomever appeared inside 
it.

----------

Meanwhile, Mia was becoming more fatalistic by the second. &#39;What&#39;s going 
to happen?&#39; she wondered. &#39;If Arine and Johan get through, we&#39;re going 
to die. If the Jewel Summoners prevail, Arine will be killed, and my 
life wouldn&#39;t matter anyway.&#39;

Mia&#39;s hands started moving about her chest and abdomen. Feeling 
completely defeated, Mia said to herself, &quot;What else can I do 
besides...?&quot; Mia did not finish her sentence. Instead, she simply 
slipped her right hand into her pants. Mia started moaning as she rubbed 
herself, imagining that Arine was the one pleasuring her.

----------

&quot;The flashes have stopped,&quot; Johan said after several moment of waiting 
for the next Jewel Summoner to be sent through the conveyer.

&quot;They must have realized that we&#39;ve found a way to stop them from 
getting to the surface,&quot; said Arine.

&quot;Good,&quot; said Johan. &quot;Now they have no way out. Let&#39;s see if we can 
figure out how to work this device.&quot;

&quot;Looking at it from here,&quot; Arine said, inspecting the arrangement of 
crystals, &quot;it looks like the corundum is used both as a propeller and a 
matter reorganizer. It partially deconstructs the person sent through 
the conveyer, fires him upward through the solid matter of the complex, 
and reconstructs the person at the surface. The spinel and apatite most 
likely aid in the conveyance. Since the Jewel Summoners still have very 
little knowledge about the power of corundum, they most likely need 
other crystals to help them use the device. The spinel probably acts to 
create a mystical barrier around the person, protecting him from the 
effects of passing through the solid matter of the floors. As for the 
apatite, it most likely helps guide the person straight to the surface, 
keeping his course from deviating.&quot;

&quot;Probably all we have to use is the corundum,&quot; Johan stated. &quot;With the 
Ruby and the Sapphire of Alvara, we should have enough power to get down 
there without the use of spinel or apatite.&quot; With that, Arine and Johan 
stepped into the center of the arrangement of crystals. They held out 
the Ruby and Sapphire of Alvara and attempted to use the conveyer. The 
Ruby glowed red and the Sapphire glowed blue. Reacting to the power of 
Alvara&#39;s crystals, the corundum in the conveyer started glowing as well. 
A beam of violet light engulfed Arine and Johan as they struggled to 
build up enough energy to activate the conveyer. A bright flash came 
from the device and the duo disappeared.

----------

Arine and Johan rematerialized at floor B2. As the beam disappeared, 
they both fell to their knees, moaning and crying in agony. &quot;Oh, dear 
God!&quot; cried Johan. How can anyone stand going through that thing?&quot; As 
Arine and Johan recovered from the jolt they had just felt, they stood 
up and examined their surroundings. &quot;Where are we now?&quot; the Finn asked.

&quot;It looks like floor B2,&quot; said Arine. On one side of the room was what 
looked like a maze, probably used to test the Jewel Summoners&#39; skills 
with apatite to guide them through the maze to the exit. On the other 
side of the room were mannequins, most likely used with the Jewel 
Summoners&#39; training with spinel. &quot;These mannequins must be for combat 
training.&quot;

Johan held out the Ruby toward one of the mannequins, throwing a great 
force toward it, chattering the figure. &quot;Not any more,&quot; he said with a 
slight smirk on his face.

----------

At floor B4, Sam was using apatite to home in on Arine and Johan, 
tracking their movements. &quot;They&#39;re on the move,&quot; said Sam. Suddenly, the 
glowing green apatite crystal that Sam was holding jerked, moving Sam&#39;s 
arm slightly downward. The lower angle of the apatite&#39;s pull could only 
mean one thing. &quot;They just made it to floor B3!&quot; cried Sam.

&quot;Prepare yourselves,&quot; said Alana. The Jewel Summoners focused all of 
their attention on the Array, waiting for Johan and Arine to appear.

----------

Mia&#39;s left had had made its way under her shirt, fondling her breasts as 
her right hand continued working under her panties. &quot;Arine,&quot; Mia moaned 
in pleasure. &quot;I love you. I love you so much Arine.&quot;

----------

The corundum crystals in the Array started glowing. &quot;Here they come!&quot; 
said Fredrika. A beam of bright, violet light shot down from the 
ceiling, landing in the center of the Array. Arine and Johan appeared in 
the circle, slightly disoriented from their final trip through the 
conveyer. The spinel crystals that the Jewel Summoners were holding 
started glowing red and giant soldiers made of glowing spinel crystal 
appeared in front of them, looking directly at Arine and Johan.

As they recovered, Johan and Arine noticed the soldiers charging at 
them. The two elfin descendants dodged out of the way and started 
throwing blasts of mystical energy at the soldiers from the Ruby and 
Sapphire. The soldiers blocked the blasts with their arms and continued 
attacking Arine and Johan.

The Jewel Summoners struggled to keep up with Arine&#39;s and Johan 
movements. &quot;Damn it!&quot; said David. &quot;Why can&#39;t we hit them? The Jewel 
Summoners destroyed all of the elves fifteen hundred years ago, why 
can&#39;t we do a thing against only two?&quot;

&quot;We never thought we would be fighting elves again,&quot; said Antonia. &quot;We 
never trained to go up against creatures so powerful.&quot;

Within the fray, Antonia&#39;s soldier charged at Johan and Johan charged at 
the soldier as well. The soldier swung its sword and Johan blocked the 
strike with the Ruby of Alvara. In one swift movement, Johan ducked 
under the sword and threw the Ruby at the soldier&#39;s torso. The Ruby, 
with a hardness of 9, pierced through the spinel armor of the solder. 
Large cracks started forming around the soldier until it eventually 
shattered. With her manifestation destroyed, Antonia&#39;s spinel crystal 
lost its power and shattered as well. Johan caught the Ruby as it fell 
from where the spinel soldier used to stand and threw a great force at 
Antonia, throwing her against the back wall of the room.

Arine was knocking down soldiers right and left by punching them to the 
ground. Arine managed to get by the soldiers to the Jewel Summoners that 
were controlling them. Arine threw her palm at one of the Jewel 
Summoners, hitting him square in the jaw with a force so great that his 
neck snapped. The soldier that the Jewel Summoner was controlling 
disappeared as the Jewel Summoner fell to the ground.

Seeing that they were losing the battle, Julia cried to her son, &quot;Run, 
Sam! Run!&quot;

&quot;Come on!&quot; said Sam, taking Yvette&#39;s hand and running down the corridor. 
Seeing them trying to escape, Arine chased after Sam and Yvette.

----------

As Sam and Yvette ran through the corridors of floor B4, Arine continued 
firing blasts of energy at them from the Sapphire of Alvara that she was 
holding. Doing their best not to be hit with an attack from the 
Sapphire, Sam and Yvette had to move quickly, ducking behind corners 
whenever they could.

However, Sam &#39;s strength was running out and he eventually tripped, 
falling to the floor and taking Yvette down with him. Arine approached 
Sam and Yvette, holding off from killing them so that she could see the 
fear in their eyes as they faced their deaths. Sam and Yvette backed up 
into a corner as Arine approached them

&quot;Arine,&quot; Sam asked. &quot;Why are you doing this? Why are you helping Johan?&quot;

&quot;I realize the truth now,&quot; Arine explained. &quot;Johan showed me what it 
meant to be an elf. He showed me the hardships that the elves have been 
made to endure. He showed me how my grandmother died! Your friends, the 
Doulins, killed Olivia just because she wouldn&#39;t give the Sapphire back 
to them, the Sapphire that she rightfully deserved as a pureblooded elf! 
You&#39;re not one of the Doulin Clan or the Dagomar Clan, so your death 
will be quick and painless.&quot;

Arine held at the Sapphire toward Sam and Yvette, intending to destroy 
them with a single attack. The Sapphire glowed blue and Sam and Yvette 
closed their eyes tightly, not wanting to watch the blast as it hit 
them. There was an evil grin on Arine&#39;s face as she built up the 
mystical energies from the Sapphire, ready to fire it at the two humans 
cowering before her.

Suddenly, an image flashed inside Arine&#39;s mind. It was only for a 
fraction of a second, but Arine could clearly see Mia on her knees on a 
mattress, her left hand under her shirt, her right hand in her pants, 
her eyes closed tightly. Arine stood motionless for a moment with a look 
of startled confusion on her face.

&quot;Arine?&quot; Sam said to himself, surprised that the 18-year-old had not 
finished them off yet.

The glazed look that had appeared in Arine&#39;s eyes the night before 
started to disappear. A tear formed in the blonde&#39;s eye as she realized 
what the meaning of her vision was. A single word then came from Arine&#39;s 
lips: &quot;Mia...&quot; Arine made a mad dash down the corridor, running as fast 
as she could, tapping into her elfin strength to make herself run 
faster.

----------

Meanwhile, Johan was still fighting the Jewel Summoners. Johan had 
struck down several Jewel Summoners. Although it was difficult to stand 
up to the power of spinel, Johan saw it as an enjoyable challenge to 
engage in. Johan faced off against the Jewel Summoners. He looked at 
them and they looked at him. Johan took a stance and aimed the Ruby at 
the Jewel Summoners. The Ruby started glowing red as Johan prepared to 
attack again.

However, the glowing of the Ruby suddenly started flickering. &quot;What?&quot; 
Johan gasped at the sudden fluctuation of the Ruby&#39;s power.

Distracted by what he was sensing, Johan almost failed to notice the 
crystal soldier charging at him. Johan dodged before the soldier struck 
his heart. However, Johan was late to dodge the soldier&#39;s sword and it 
pierced his right shoulder. Johan cried out in agony as he felt the 
sword digging into his flesh. He fired a blast of energy at the soldier, 
throwing it away from him, its sword retracting from his shoulder.

Johan grabbed his shoulder in pain as he tried to make sense of what had 
just transpired. &#39;What the hell just happened?&#39; Johan wondered. &#39;What 
did I sense just then?&#39; It was then that Johan realized that his partner 
was no longer in the room. &#39;Where&#39;s Arine?&#39; Johan held up the Ruby and 
threw a powerful force out in all directions throwing all of the Jewel 
Summoners out of his way as he rushed down the corridor that Arine had 
taken.

----------

Arine followed the direction that her senses were guiding her. Knowing 
that Mia was in critical danger, she knew that she had to get to her 
girlfriend before it was too late.

As Arine rounded the next corner, she found herself at the entrance to 
the emergency shelter. She stared in horror at the sight before her. Mia 
was squirming about on a mattress, masturbating. Her eyes were closed 
tightly and her teeth were clenched, showing that she was close to 
orgasm.

&quot;Mia!&quot; Arine cried. Time slowed to a crawl. Seconds seemed like minutes 
as Arine dropped the Sapphire and ran toward Mia.

Hearing Arine cry out her name, Mia opened her eyes and looked at the 
blond-haired girl running at her. &quot;Arine?&quot; she whimpered as tears came 
to her brown eyes. Arine leapt toward Mia. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Mia said as 
Arine flew through the air toward her.

Mia&#39;s eyes shot wide open and she gasped. A sense of disaster suddenly 
hit Arine and a look of absolute horror came cross the blonde&#39;s face. 
&quot;Oh no!&quot; said Arine, realizing that Mia&#39;s orgasm had just hit.

Mia cried out in bliss and Arine landed on top of her, embracing Mia 
tightly. As they both hit the mattress, Arine got up onto her hands and 
knees and looked down upon Mia. The brunette was unconscious, she was 
not breathing, and all of the color had left her face. &quot;Oh no,&quot; said 
Arine hysterically. &quot;Not again. Mia!&quot; Arine shook Mia frantically, 
trying to wake her up. &quot;Come on Mia, wake up!&quot; she cried. &quot;Wake up, 
Mia!&quot;

Johan rounded the corner, his shoulder still bleeding. He saw Arine on 
the mattress, screaming in a state of panic. &quot;Arine?&quot; he asked, &quot;What 
are you doing?&quot;

Arine was completely oblivious to Johan&#39;s presence. She simply kept 
screaming with tears gushing from her eyes, &quot;Mia! Please! Don&#39;t die on 
me!&quot;

Johan saw the blue crystal lying on the ground in front of him. 
Suddenly, the Finn completely forgot the searing pain in his shoulder. 
&#39;The Sapphire,&#39; he thought. &#39;It&#39;s mine!&#39;

As Johan reached for the Sapphire, it suddenly started glowing blue. 
Arine suddenly snapped up to a sitting position as she sensed something 
calling out to her. &quot;The Sapphire!&quot; she cried. Arine spun around and 
reached toward the Sapphire. Johan dove toward the Sapphire, but the 
crystal flew as if on its own out of Johan&#39;s reach and straight into 
Arine&#39;s outstretched hand! Swinging the Sapphire about, Arine threw a 
powerful force at Johan, sending him flying out of the shelter and back 
down the corridor.

With Johan temporarily out of the way, Arine turned back to Mia&#39;s 
motionless body. &#39;What am I going to do,&#39; Arine wondered desperately. 
&#39;If Mia dies, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do.&#39; Just then, Arine had an idea. 
&#39;Wait!&#39; she realized. &#39;My powers!&#39;

Arine brushed Mia&#39;s hair out of her face, allowing her to put her hands 
to Mia&#39;s cheeks, putting herself in physical contact with Mia&#39;s skin. 
&quot;Come on, Mia,&quot; said Arine. Come back to me. Live. Live! LIVE!&quot; Arine 
brought her lips to Mia&#39;s and kissed the brunette passionately, trying 
to breath life back into the smaller girl.

The Sapphire suddenly started glowing brightly. Sensing the power of the 
Sapphire, Arine looked at the blue Jewel glowing. For the first time, 
Arine saw Mia&#39;s hair sparkle brilliantly. &#39;What?&#39; the blonde wondered, 
confused about the sparkling of Mia&#39;s hair.

However, Arine quickly forgot about the grains of sand in Mia&#39;s hair as 
the color returned to Mia&#39;s face and she started breathing again. &quot;Oh, 
thank God!&quot; Arine cried, so thankful that Mia&#39;s attack was over.

Johan stood up to observe what was going on. Then, as Johan reentered 
the shelter, Arine stood up and slowly turned around. She looked at 
Johan with an expression of complete, unbridled rage. &quot;Damn you, Johan,&quot; 
she said. &quot;DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!&quot;

Arine fired a blast of energy at Johan from the Sapphire. Johan held up 
the Ruby and fired a blast of equal power back at Arine. The two blasts 
collided at the two elfin descendants fought to overcome the other&#39;s 
power. Arine and Johan struggled to overpower each other, each of them 
fueled by the deep hatred that they had.

As they poured all of the power they had into the blasts of energy that 
were battling in the center of the room, Johan happened to glance over 
at Mia. Because Arine had brushed Mia&#39;s hair out of her face, Johan saw 
the points at the end of Mia&#39;s ears. Johan&#39;s eyes widened in surprise 
and absolute astonishment. &quot;Those ears!&quot; he cried.

Having lost his concentration, Johan&#39;s mystical energies were overcome 
by Arine&#39;s and Johan was again thrown backwards into the corridor. 
Completely bewildered and not knowing what to believe any more, all that 
Johan could do was flee the scene. Arine chased after Johan, not wanting 
to let him escape.

As Johan rounded the bend, he saw the Jewel Summoners after him. &quot;Hold 
it right there, Johan,&quot; said Felix, blocking Johan&#39;s path. Not stopping 
for anything, Johan threw another powerful force from the Ruby, sending 
the Jewel Summoners flying out of his way. Johan simply ran past them 
with Arine hot on his tail. The Jewel Summoners got to their knees and 
looked on in confusion. &quot;What in God&#39;s name is going on here?&quot; wondered 
Felix.

----------

Johan made it back to where the sortie had started and he jumped into 
the Array. He held up the Ruby and it started glowing. The corundum of 
the Array reacted to the Ruby and started glowing as well. Johan 
struggled with all of his might to activate the Array so that he could 
escape from Arine&#39;s wrath.

Just as Arine entered the room, a beam of red light shot up from the 
Array, engulfing Johan. When the beam of light passed upward, 
disappearing behind the ceiling, Johan was gone. For a moment, Arine 
just stood there in astonishment. As she began to return to reality and 
realized that Johan had escaped, Arine fell to her knees, disheartened 
by failing to stop Johan.

----------

The Jewel Summoners rushed Mia to the infirmary where they connected her 
to a ventilator to restore oxygen to the unconscious girl&#39;s body. Not 
resisting at all, Arine allowed the Jewel Summoners to apprehend her, 
take the Sapphire of Alvara from her, and confine her to a prison cell.

The infirmary was filled with the moans and cries of agony from the 
Jewel Summoners that were injured in the raid. Pierre, Sam, David, 
Julia, and Yvette were appalled to the point of near-nausea as they 
observed the situation. &quot;Unthinkable that something like this would 
happen,&quot; David said.

&quot;Twenty-two of our comrades dead, thirty-four seriously injured,&quot; Julia 
disgustedly stated the statistics.

&quot;And Mia, again, fighting for her life,&quot; said Sam.

&quot;What would have caused Arine to turn on us?&quot; Yvette wondered.

Pierre explained, &quot;Arine is being kept under guard. The Blue Sapphire of 
Alvara has been returned to Lord Felix&#39;s care. And she won&#39;t be getting 
any help from Johan any time soon. But it seems that Arine was not 
acting completely of her own free will. At the last minute, Arine ran to 
Mia and tried to save her. Mia would be dead now if Arine hadn&#39;t given 
her strength. And she showed no resistance when the Jewel Summoners 
apprehended her.&quot;

&quot;But still...&quot; Sam said, looking at Mia, lying on the bed, unconscious.

----------

In her prison cell, Arine thought about the events that had transpired. 
She could not believe that she had aided in the murder of people that 
were only trying to help her. She was distraught by the fact that it was 
her fault that Mia had had another attack. Arine could sense that Mia 
was in critical condition and that the chances were slim that the 
brunette would come out of the ordeal alive.

&quot;Mia...&quot; Arine exhaled. The 18-year-old stood up and walked to the wall 
of her cell. Overcome with guilt and rage, Arine yelled and pounded the 
wall with her fist. Arine left a large dent every time her fist collided 
with it. She kept pounding against the wall, over and over again, 
leaving dent after dent, until she finally tired herself out and fell to 
her knees burying her face in her hands, crying harder than she ever 
had.</pre>
