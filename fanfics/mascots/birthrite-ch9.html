&quot;How did Johan know that Arine was the elf?&quot; David asked.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how he knew,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;What matters is that 
Johan has taken the elf captive and is now in possession of both the Red 
Ruby AND the Blue Sapphire of Alvara.&quot;

&quot;We have to rescue Arine,&quot; said Sam, standing up from his seat.

&quot;...And retrieve the Ruby and Sapphire,&quot; said Rosette, jumping to her 
feet as well.

All of the Jewel Summoners began speaking their minds, their voices 
quickly escalating into thunderous white noise. The Clan Leaders in the 
center of the meeting room looked around, astounded by their subjects 
speaking all at once.

&quot;STAI ZITTI!!!&quot; Lord Giovanni boomed. The clamoring Jewel Summoners 
turned their heads toward Giovanni, seeing the elderly Italian with a 
very angry expression on his face. They immediately stopped talking and 
sat down in their seats. &quot;You do not speak out of turn!&quot; Giovanni 
yelled. A moment passed and Giovanni regained his composure. &quot;I know you 
are worried about the situation,&quot; he said. &quot;We all are. But we gave to 
keep our feelings in check if we are to complete our mission as Jewel 
Summoners.&quot;

&quot;Lord Giovanni is right,&quot; said Alana. &quot;Only with clear mind and sound 
judgment can we bring the situation under control.&quot;

There was a pause so that the Clan Leaders could be absolutely sure that 
their subjects had calmed down. When the Jewel Summoners&#39; calmness was 
affirmed, Lady Fredrika spoke, &quot;What we must do now is think carefully 
about the situation. What do we know so far?&quot;

At that question, Sam stood up. &quot;Sir Samuel Lancestor,&quot; said Alana.

&quot;What we know,&quot; Sam answered, &quot;is that Johan Mustanen has in his 
possession the Red Ruby of Alvara, the Blue Sapphire of Alvara, and 
Arine Sylven.&quot;

&quot;What would Johan want with those things?&quot; Alana asked.

&quot;Well he obviously wants the Ruby and the Sapphire to enhance his elfin 
powers,&quot; said Sam.

&quot;What about the elf?&quot; Alana asked. &quot;What would Johan want with her?&quot;

That time, Sam did not have an answer. &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; he replied, 
sitting down.

&quot;Does anyone know?&quot; Alana asked.

Pierre stood. &quot;Lord Pierre Doulin,&quot; said Lord Felix.

&quot;When Johan attacked us in California,&quot; Pierre said, &quot;he said something 
about the future of his clan. He said that his uncle had a deadly 
illness and that the elf was the only one who could cure him.&quot;

Gabriel Lancestor then stood up. &quot;Sir Gabriel Lancestor,&quot; Alana 
announced.

&quot;Johan must be using Arine to help cure his uncle,&quot; said Gabriel. &quot;The 
Ruby and the Sapphire are the keys to unlocking the elf&#39;s power. If 
Johan used the Ruby and the Sapphire to awaken Arine&#39;s powers, she would 
have the power to heal Mustanen&#39;s uncle!&quot;

&quot;Bon, Bon,&quot; said Felix, a slight smile appearing on his face. &quot;We&#39;re 
making some progress.&quot;

Pierre then said, &quot;I do not believe that awakening Arine&#39;s powers is 
Johan&#39;s only motive.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; asked Felix.

&quot;I have witnessed first-hand Johan&#39;s hatred toward the Jewel Summoners,&quot; 
Pierre said. &quot;I cannot believe that it would be enough for him to simply 
bring about the new age of the elves.&quot;

&quot;Do you suspect that Johan is planning an attack on the Jewel 
Summoners?&quot; asked Gabriel.

&quot;It&#39;s a good bet that he is,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;The question is &#39;when?&#39;&quot;

Pierre and Gabriel both sat. As they did so, Antonia Valentino stood. 
&quot;Lady Antonia Valentino,&quot; said Giovanni.

&quot;Arine is loyal to the Jewel Summoners, is she not?&quot; Antonia asked. &quot;If 
Johan were planning an attack on us, Arine would undoubtedly use her 
powers to stop him. She is the Legendary Elf. She would have much more 
power than Johan.&quot;

&quot;Nevertheless,&quot; Fredrika said, &quot;we need a plan to retrieve Arine AND the 
Blue Sapphire and Red Ruby of Alvara. We must awaken Arine&#39;s powers!&quot;

Rosette Doulin stood up. &quot;Madame Rosette Doulin,&quot; Felix announced.

&quot;But aren&#39;t Arine&#39;s powers going to be awakened anyway?&quot; Rosette asked. 
&quot;If Johan&#39;s intentions are to awaken the elf, another descendent of the 
elves would be the best one suited for the job.&quot;

&quot;That is a good point,&quot; said Alana. &quot;The Lancestor Clan will find the 
Blue Sapphire and Red Ruby with the power of apatite. We will find 
Alvara&#39;s crystals and keep a close eye on the surrounding activity, but 
we will not intervene. We will let Johan do what he will. But as soon as 
we believe Arine is in danger, we will take him by surprise and rescue 
the elf.&quot;

----------

----------

Johan led Arine into another room. As Arine looked around, she noticed 
that the room they were in now was not nearly as bare as the last one 
they were in. In the center of the room has a table that seemed to be 
used for someone to lie down on. In the corner of the room was some kind 
of machine, consisting of a computer screen and many white sapphires 
arranged in a very intricate pattern. &quot;What is all this?&quot; the blonde 
asked.

Johan answered, &quot;This is equipment that I will use to awaken your 
powers. The Mustanen Clan never knew where the elf would show up, so we 
created machines like this all over the world. Now that the elves are no 
longer confined to the Scandinavian Peninsula like the purebloods were, 
we have found sources of corundum much more plentiful than Alvara&#39;s 
Cave.&quot; Johan gestured to the machine and said, &quot;These white sapphires 
will be used to find the gene sequences in your DNA that grant you your 
elfin powers.&quot;

&quot;What about the table?&quot; Arine asked, noticing that there were several 
steel objects corrected to it that looked as if they were meant to 
restrain a person lying down on it.

&quot;The process of awakening your powers involves injecting you with a 
hypnotic drug,&quot; Johan explained. &quot;The reasons for this are two-fold. 
Firstly, you will need to be under my control if I am to guide you to 
finding your powers. Secondly, a small part of you already knows how to 
use your powers. You have used your powers before unintentionally. The 
hypnotic effect of the drug should help you get in touch with your 
subconscious, access that part of your mind that knows how to use your 
powers. While you are under the effects of the drug, you might not be 
able to control your powers when they awaken, the effects of which could 
be very violent. The table is meant to restrain you for your safety and 
that of me and others around you.&quot;

&quot;I see&quot;

&quot;I will need a blood sample. I need to isolate the gene sequences in 
your DNA that are not found in normal humans. When you use one of your 
powers, the machine is meant to register the mystical energies that 
allow you to use that power. That is the reason for all the sapphires. 
Because it is YOUR blood that the machine reads, it will determine which 
genes are responsible for which power. Do you understand, Arine?&quot;

&quot;Perfectly,&quot; said Arine, sitting down on the table. Johan went to his 
station behind the machine and came back with a small lancing device, an 
alcohol swab, and a pack of adhesive bandages. &quot;What is that?&quot; Arine 
said, noticing the lancing device.

&quot;A blood-sampling device,&quot; the Finn replied. &quot;It is meant to puncture 
the skin and extract a sample of blood from the subject. The alcohol 
swab is used to sterilize the area where I will be taking the sample to 
make sure that the wound does not become infected. Please, hold out your 
finger.&quot; Arine was apprehensive. She had always a had a fear of needles. 
&quot;I know that the thought of puncturing your skin is unsettling. It will 
be painful, but it is necessary for the procedure to work.&quot; Although 
Arine did not extend her hand by herself, she did not resist when Johan 
took her hand in his. Johan extended Arine&#39;s index finger and rubbed it 
with the alcohol swab. He then picked up the lancing device. &quot;Are you 
ready, Arine?&quot; he asked. Reluctantly, Arine nodded. With Arine&#39;s 
approval, Johan punctured Arine&#39;s finger with the lancing device. Arine 
flinched in pain, but it was not too painful for her to handle. In a 
matter of seconds, her finger was bandaged and the pain was gone. &quot;There 
we are,&quot; said Johan. &quot;That wasn&#39;t so bad, was it?&quot;

Johan went back to his station and inserted the blood sample into a 
small slot on the side of the machine. Arine could hear the hard disk 
spinning as the machine analyzed the blood sample. After a few moments, 
six series of lines of differing thickness appeared on the computer 
screen that Johan was looking at. &quot;Come here, Arine,&quot; Johan said. Arine 
stood up and walked toward Johan&#39;s station. &quot;You see this?&quot; said Johan, 
referring to the lines on the computer screen. &quot;This is you. These are 
the gene sequences inside your body that separate you from humans. These 
are the elfin genes that you inherited from your grandmother. The only 
genes that the Mustanens have inherited from our elfin ancestors are 
foresight and the pointed ears. But there are only two generations that 
separate you from the purebloods, so you have inherited much, much more 
from the elves than my clan has. When your powers activate, the whites 
sapphires in this machine will pick up the mystical energies that you 
give off and will relate each of your powers to one of these gene 
sequences.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an impressive machine,&quot; Arine said. &quot;What are you going to do once 
you identify which gene sequences control each power?&quot;

&quot;My foresight has allowed me to see how the new age of the elves will 
begin,&quot; said Johan. &quot;It will begin with gene therapy. By injecting these 
gene sequences into the DNA of other people, they will inherit the 
powers of the elves, and will become elves themselves. Of course, there 
are only a select few that are worthy of having these powers. Most 
humans are greedy and power-hungry. Just look at what has happened in 
the past century: conflicts over territory, dictatorships in the Middle 
East, two World Wars. They would use these powers for their own agendas. 
The Mustanen Clan is the only clan of elfin descent that remembers its 
origins. Only they know what it means to be an elf, to be in tune with 
nature, to be one with the elements. They are the ones that will restore 
peace and order to the world. They will create a utopia, an Eden, where 
elves rule the land as they did fifteen centuries ago.&quot;

&quot;So once you have found which gene sequences control which power, you 
will replicate the gene sequences and inject certain genes into elfin 
descendants depending on which genes they don&#39;t have?&quot; the blonde asked.

&quot;That&#39;s exactly what I will do,&quot; Johan said, smiling. &quot;I&#39;m so happy that 
you understand what I am trying to accomplish.&quot;

There was a pause. Arine was still considering whether or not she wanted 
to go through with the procedure. Eventually, Arine said, &quot;I&#39;m ready.&quot; 
Arine walked back to the table and lied down on top of it. &quot;I&#39;m ready to 
begin the procedure.&quot;

----------

Johan closed the harness over Arine&#146;s body, making sure that she would 
be unable to move anything except her hands, feet, and head. After 
rubbing an alcohol swab over a spot on Arine&#146;s arm, Johan picked up a 
hypodermic needle filled with a yellowish fluid. &quot;Are you ready?&quot; asked 
the Finn. The blonde simply nodded. Having received Arine&#146;s approval to 
continue, Johan positioned the needle over the place on Arine&#146;s skin 
that he had just sterilized.

Arine groaned and spasmed in pain as the needle entered her flesh, the 
yellowish fluid contained within it being injected into her body. As the 
last of the drug disappeared beneath Arine&#146;s skin, Johan removed the 
needle from the girl&#146;s arm and quickly bandaged the puncture wound. 
Arine gasped in relief as the pain started to subside,

&quot;The drug should take effect in a few moments,&quot; Johan said.

&quot;I hope it&#146;s worth the pain,&quot; said Arine, still with a hint of recent 
trauma in her voice.

&quot;It&#39;s worth it,&quot; the man assured Arine. Johan went on to explain, &quot;The 
initial symptoms of the drug are weakness and inability to move 
voluntarily. You will remain conscious throughout the procedure, but 
your conscious mind will not be in control of your body movements. 
Whatever you do while under the influence will be dictated by me. You 
will be able to resist my commands just like one is able to resist 
breathing, but it will cause physical pain. So please, do not try to 
resist my commands.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; Arine assured.

Johan returned to his station at the computer screen. &quot;I will be 
monitoring the mystical energies from here,&quot; he said. As the two of them 
waited, a strange and unfamiliar feeling began to come over Arine. She 
felt weakness in her muscles, her vision started to blur, and she felt 
slightly disconnected from the physical world. &quot;Are you all right, 
Arine?&quot; Johan asked, noticing Arine&#39;s reactions.

&quot;I think...&quot; Arine said as best she could, &quot;...the drug&#39;s beginning...to 
take effect. I feel...I feel...weak. Weak all over.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re finding it difficult to control your body, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yesh,&quot; said Arine, her speech beginning to slur. Arine&#39;s eyes began to 
glaze over as her body succumbed to the hypnotic effects of the drug.

&quot;Just relax and let it come over you,&quot; Johan said in a soothing voice. 
&quot;It will be like floating in the ocean, just letting the waves rock you 
back and forth, the current carrying you where it will.&quot; Finally, 
Arine&#39;s expression turned completely blank and she simply stared out 
into space. &quot;Can you speak?&quot; Johan asked. Arine did not answer or even 
move. &quot;I guess not,&quot; Johan said, knowing that the drug had now 
completely taken effect.

Turning to the computer screen, Johan said, &quot;The first ability I will 
attempt to awaken will be your foresight.&quot; Concentrating his thoughts on 
Arine, Johan said, &quot;Think back to a time when you anticipated something 
happening. You sensed that something was going to happen. You had a 
premonition.&quot; Obeying Johan&#39;s commands, memories began floating through 
Arine&#39;s mind. Arine remembered the dream she had had on Mia&#39;s birthday. 
Again, the blonde found herself with Mia at the beach. Arine swam as 
fast as she could toward Mia as the current pulled the brunette out to 
sea.

Arine&#39;s back arched and her hair sparkled brilliantly. If it were not 
for the restraining harness, Arine&#39;s convulsions would have launched her 
off of the table. &quot;That&#39;s it, Arine,&quot; said Johan sensing a power 
emerging from deep within Arine&#39;s body. The white sapphires of the 
machine, reacting to Arine&#39;s elfin powers, started glowing white. &quot;Let 
me see that mystical energy,&quot; Johan enthused, excited by the prospect of 
the elf&#39;s powers finally awakening. The machine doing what it was 
designed to do, it analyzed the mystical energies that the sapphires 
reacted to, relating them to one of the gene sequences, which lit up on 
the computer screen. &quot;The gene of foresight...&quot; Johan mused. As the 
memory ended, Arine&#39;s body came to rest and the white sapphires stopped 
glowing.

&quot;Now why don&#39;t we try physical strength?&quot; said Johan. Again 
concentrating his thoughts on Arine, Johan said, &quot;Think back to a time 
when you were able to summon strength that you should not have had.&quot; 
Another memory bubbled to the surface of Arine&#39;s hypnotized mind. She 
remembered the time that she was at Sam&#39;s house after her premonition of 
Mia&#39;s danger. She was outside the door to Sam&#39;s room. Arine charged 
toward the door, threw herself against it, breaking the locked door open 
with one blow with her shoulder.

Again, Arine&#39;s body started spasming, another power awakening within 
her. As Arine relived the event, the room started shaking, effected by 
the ability that Arine had used. &quot;Such power,&quot; Johan said, amazed by 
Arine&#39;s use of elfin power. &quot;Could the ability of physical strength be a 
form of telekinesis?&quot; The white sapphires again glowed white and another 
gene sequence lit up on the screen. Arine&#39;s memory faded and her body 
came to rest. The room stopped shaking and the glowing of the sapphires 
stopped. &quot;That was intense, wasn&#39;t it, my dear?&quot; Johan said. &quot;You truly 
are powerful.&quot;

Moving on, Johan said, &quot;How about we try empathy next. Think back to a 
time that you sensed what someone was feeling. A time when you could 
sense someone&#39;s emotions.&quot; Arine remembered being at the Oceanside 
Academy medical facility. She was with Sam, waiting for the prognosis 
after Mia&#39;s attack. Sam had told Arine that he was trying to help. Arine 
could hear the sincerity in Sam&#39;s voice and somehow knew that he was 
telling the truth.

Once more, Arine reacted violently to her memory, tremors overtaking her 
body. The white sapphires lit up, reading Arine&#39;s mystical energies. A 
third gene sequence lit up on the screen. The memory passed and the 
glowing of the sapphires stopped. &quot;Very nice,&quot; Johan said, happy that he 
had isolated three gene sequences that governed the powers of the elves.

&quot;And now,&quot; Johan said with a dreamy tone of voice, &quot;for the most 
important gene of all, the one that can counteract the heart condition 
that my family suffers from: the gene of biological vigor.&quot; Coming out 
of his reverie, Johan turned again to the hypnotized girl on the table. 
&quot;Think back to a time when you came in physical contact with someone and 
helped them recover from an injury or illness.&quot; The memory that came to 
Arine&#39;s mind was right after Johan had attempted to abduct Mia outside 
Pierre Doulin&#39;s house. Mia was close to having an attack. Arine and Sam 
were holding Mia tightly, comforting the brunette, letting her know that 
they would not let anything happen to her.

Arine&#39;s body seized up one last time, the white sapphires reacting to 
her power. &quot;Show me your power, Arine,&quot; Johan commanded, his voice 
overflowing with enthusiasm and excitement. &quot;Show me your ability of 
healing!&quot; A fourth gene sequence lit up on the computer screen. &quot;There 
it is,&quot; Johan mused, &quot;the gene sequence that would have saved Rikhard if 
he had possessed it.&quot; Arine&#39;s body came to rest and the white sapphires 
stopped glowing. Turning to Arine, Johan said, &quot;Thank you very much, 
Arine. You did well. I am impressed.&quot; Her elfin powers no longer in use, 
Arine&#39;s hair stopped sparkling.

&quot;Hm,&quot; Johan said, looking back at the computer screen. &quot;There are two 
genes that did not light up. I will have to look into those later.&quot; 
Finished for the time being, Johan shut down the machine and walked to 
where Arine was lying. &quot;In the meantime,&quot; he said, &quot;rest well. Give your 
mind a chance to review what has happened here tonight. Rest.&quot; Arine, 
still following Johan&#39;s orders, closed her eyes and rested. &quot;It will not 
be long now, my dear.&quot;

----------

Meanwhile, in Zurich, Mia was still asleep. Yvette continued keeping an 
eye on the weakened girl while Pierre was meeting with the other Jewel 
Summoners. However, Yvette&#39;s gaze turned from Mia to the door when she 
heard a knocking. The woman went to the door and opened it to see Pierre 
standing in the doorway. &quot;Pierre,&quot; said Yvette.

&quot;Hello, Yvette,&quot; said Pierre. The middle-aged man then looked at the 
brunette in bed. &quot;Mia&#39;s still asleep,&quot; he noticed.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her, Pierre?&quot; asked Yvette. &quot;Why is she so weak?&quot;

Now that he was not convened with the other Jewel Summoners, Pierre had 
a chance to explain to Yvette the story of what was happening. &quot;You must 
have noticed Mia&#39;s pointed ears by now,&quot; said the professor. &quot;It&#39;s a 
genetic trait that gives her a weak heart. Because of her heart 
condition, she tires easily. This day has been one of the most intense 
she has ever experienced. Without Arine&#39;s powers, I do not think Mia 
will recover any time soon.&quot;

&quot;Powers?&quot; Yvette asked.

&quot;Elfin powers,&quot; replied Pierre. &quot;Both Mia and Arine are descended from 
elves that lived in Scandinavia fifteen hundred years ago. Mia inherited 
the pointed ears, and Arine inherited the elfin powers that were able to 
counteract the effects of the weak heart. All of the pureblooded elves 
were destroyed by Jewel Summoners, the ancestors of everyone that 
convened today. Ever since then, the Jewel Summoners have devoted their 
lives to fulfilling a prophecy that was made fifteen hundred years ago: 
that a legendary elf would be born and would bring about a new age of 
the elves. That flying machine that I used to bring us here from Paris 
is a physical manifestation that only high-ranking Jewel Summoners can 
summon with the power of a spinel crystal.&quot;

&quot;Elves...&quot; Yvette trailed off, finding it difficult to accept Pierre&#39;s 
story.

&quot;I know it&#146;s hard to believe,&quot;Pierre said. &quot;But I swear to you, all that 
I have said is true.&quot;

----------

Arine&#39;s head pounded as she came to her senses. She slowly opened her 
eyes and noticed that the harness that Johan had used to hold her down 
had been retracted. The blonde tried to sit up, but her body ached so 
badly that it took her several moments to do so. Arine held her head in 
her hand, groaning in pain.

&quot;Good morning, Arine,&quot; someone said, walking into the room.

Arine could barely make out Johan&#39;s form standing in front of her. 
&quot;Morning?&quot; she asked. &quot;What time is it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s after eleven AM,&quot; Johan replied. Arine closed her eyes and groaned 
in discomfort. &quot;Are you all right, Arine?&quot; asked Johan.

&quot;I have a splitting headache,&quot; the girl moaned. &quot;In fact, my whole body 
hurts. It feels like my body is being crushed.&quot;

&quot;It sounds similar to a hangover,&quot; the Finn remarked. &quot;It&#39;s probably a 
side effect of the drug I gave you last night.&quot;

&quot;Do you have any Advil nearby?&quot; Arine asked.

&quot;You should be able to cure your symptoms yourself,&quot; said Johan.

&quot;How?&quot; asked Arine.

&quot;Just relax. Concentrate. Remember what happened last night. Think about 
your ability to heal injuries and illness.&quot; Arine closed her eyes and 
thought back to the events that had transpired the night before. 
Remembering her ability to heal people, she used the ability on herself. 
&quot;How do you feel now?&quot; Johan asked after Arine opened her eyes.

&quot;Better,&quot; said the blonde, a smile coming to her face. &quot;A lot better.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Johan said, smiling as well. &quot;Tell me, Arine. What am I feeling 
right now?&quot;

&quot;How do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Can you sense my emotions?&quot;

Arine was surprised when she realized that she could. &quot;Yes,&quot; she 
answered. &quot;I think so.&quot;

&quot;What am I feeling?&quot; Johan asked.

Arine regarded Johan for a moment, scanning his thoughts. &quot;You 
feel...happy,&quot; said Arine. &quot;You enjoy the fact that I have realized my 
powers. You are...relieved about something.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m relieved that I have finally found someone that has the ability to 
cure so many of my clan from their heart condition,&quot; Johan replied.

However, Johan was slightly surprised by what Arine said next. &quot;There is 
something else. Something hidden very deep within you.&quot; Arine 
concentrated for a moment, attempting to identify the emotions that she 
was sensing from Johan. Arine then said, &quot;Sadness. Anger. Ill will.&quot;

&quot;Do you really sense those emotions from me?&quot; asked the man.

&quot;They&#39;re hidden so deep inside you,&quot; Arine explained, &quot;that you might 
know they are there. But they are.&quot; Just then, a thought occurred to 
Arine. &quot;Johan,&quot; she asked, &quot;did something bad happen to you? Possibly a 
traumatizing event sometime in your life?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Johan remembered. &quot;Something did happen to me. I had a twin 
brother named Rikhard. He had the same heart condition that so many 
members of my clan have. Twenty years ago, Rikhard met a Jewel Summoner 
by the name of Erika Dagomar. After the two of them married, Erika 
killed Rikhard by taking advantage of his heart condition and fucked 
him. She probably just wanted to have a good come and kill Rikhard at 
the same time. I followed Erika all over the world until I caught up 
with her in the Far East. I was about to kill her, but she jumped off of 
a waterfall before I had the chance.&quot;

&quot;You hate the Jewel Summoners for the death of your brother,&quot; the blonde 
realized. &quot;And you hate them for depriving you of your revenge.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s more than that,&quot; Johan stated, his voice filling with a mixture of 
anger and sadness. &quot;They destroyed my ancestors. They depleted the world 
of the one gene sequence that would have saved my brother, my father, 
all of my kinsmen that have the disorder!&quot;

It was then that Arine put her hand on Johan&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Erika Dagomar 
was just one Jewel Summoner,&quot; said Arine. &quot;I have been to their meetings 
and there were more than a hundred Jewel Summoners in that meeting room. 
If we attack them now, they&#39;ll never see us coming.&quot; Johan&#39;s expression 
changed from one of melancholy to one of delight and anticipation. 
&quot;You&#39;re happy to hear me say that, aren&#39;t you?&quot; said Arine, sensing that 
Johan was pleased by what he was hearing.

&quot;Very,&quot; answered the long-haired man. &quot;I have been anticipating this day 
for twenty years. Finally, I will have my revenge!&quot;

&quot;We will have OUR revenge,&quot; Arine corrected.

The two elfin descendants looked at one another. Johan produced the Blue 
Sapphire and Red Ruby of Alvara from his pocket and gave the Sapphire to 
Arine. Her powers now awakened, Arine could feel the power of the 
Sapphire flowing through her. She was ready to aid Johan in the 
destruction of the Jewel Summoners.

----------

That night, Lady Fredrika, Lady Alana, and a small band of Jewel 
Summoners were gathered in the meeting room, discussing their game plan 
for retrieving the Red Ruby of Alvara, the Blue Sapphire of Alvara, and 
the elf. &quot;Don&#39;t forget the plan,&quot; said Alana. &quot;Once we have found Arine, 
we watch the area for any information that we can use. We only move in 
when Arine&#39;s powers have awoken or when Arine is in danger.&quot;

&quot;We were able to sense Arine&#39;s powers when the Sapphire reacted to her 
touch in Paris,&quot; said Fredrika. &quot;If we could sense her powers from five 
hundred miles away, we will definitely be able to sense when she 
awakens.&quot; Fredrika said to her subjects, &quot;Dagomars ready?&quot;

The members of the Dagomar Clan answered, &quot;Ready!&quot;

&quot;Lancestors ready?&quot; Alana asked.

&quot;Ready!&quot; the Lancestors replied.

With the operatives ready for their reconnaissance mission, Alana held 
up an apatite crystal in an attempt to home in on the Blue Sapphire of 
Alvara. The crystal glowed green and the elderly woman concentrated on 
it.

As she used the power of apatite, a look of surprise came over Alana&#39;s 
face. &quot;Lady Alana?&quot; asked David &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;The Sapphire,&quot; Alana said. &quot;It&#146;s close.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Fredrika agreed. &quot;I can sense the Sapphire&#39;s power.&quot;

&quot;Do you sense the Ruby as well, Lady Fredrika?&quot; one of the Dagomars 
asked the clan leader.

&quot;No,&quot; Fredrika replied. &quot;Only the Sapphire.&quot;

&quot;If Johan were to attack us,&quot; Julia speculated, &quot;he would have taken 
both the Sapphire AND the Ruby.&quot;

&quot;Do you think that Arine has escaped?&quot; Alana wondered.

&quot;I did sense a lot of unusual mystical energies last night,&quot; Fredrika 
recalled. &quot;The elf must have awoken! She would have easily overpowered 
Johan if her powers have indeed awoken.&quot;

&quot;We should go and welcome her back,&quot; David suggested. &quot;We don&#39;t even 
know what condition she&#39;s in.&quot;

&quot;It would be best for her to see friendly and familiar faces when she 
returns,&quot; Julia agreed.

Fredrika decreed, &quot;Summon Lord Pierre Doulin and Sir David Lancestor. 
And if she is feeling up to it, summon Miss Mia Carver as well.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Milady,&quot; the other Jewel Summoners responded.

----------

Mia had finally woken up that afternoon. Although awake, Mia refused to 
get out of bed or talk with anybody. &quot;Won&#39;t you say something, Mia?&quot; 
Yvette pleaded. Still, Mia said nothing.

&quot;Lady Alana and Lady Fredrika are sending the Lancestors and the 
Dagomars to Arine as we speak, Mia,&quot; said Pierre, trying to raise the 
brown-haired girl&#39;s spirits. &quot;We&#39;ll have her back in no time.&quot;

Mia finally spoke, but her words were disheartening. &quot;How can they stand 
up to the power of the Ruby and Sapphire of Alvara?&quot;

Not giving up in cheering Mia up, Pierre said, &quot;The Lancestors are very 
good at finding information and the Dagomars are some of the most 
powerful of all the Jewel Summoner clans. If anyone can rescue Arine, 
it&#39;s them.&quot;

Just then, there was a frantic knocking at the door. &quot;Lord Pierre! Mia! 
Open up!&quot; Sam&#39;s voice cried from behind the door. Yvette answered the 
door to find Sam with a hysterical, but ecstatic, look on his face. 
&quot;Yvette, Pierre, Mia,&quot; Sam exclaimed. &quot;Arine has returned!&quot; Yvette 
gasped, Pierre jumped to his feet, and Mia sat up in bed. All of their 
undivided attention was focused on Sam. &quot;My parents just told me,&quot; Sam 
ranted. &quot;Lady Alana homed in on the Sapphire, it&#146;s close by! Fredrika 
didn&#39;t sense the power of the Ruby, which would have been there if Johan 
was there. It has to be Arine!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure Arine would be happy to see your face, Mia,&quot; Pierre said, 
trying to be as composed as possible.

Mia&#39;s face had suddenly brightened with large, shimmering eyes and a 
smile overflowing with indescribable happiness. &quot;Arine...&quot; Mia said, 
getting out of bed.

However, in her weakened state, Mia collapsed as soon as she set foot on 
the floor. &quot;Mia!&quot; Sam cried, rushing to the girl&#39;s side. Sam, Pierre, 
and Yvette helped Mia back into bed.

&quot;We&#39;ll greet Arine,&quot; Yvette said. &quot;We&#39;ll bring her to you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Mia in a weak, but grateful voice. With that, Pierre, 
Sam, and Yvette exited the room.

Unbeknownst to them, the only reason that Fredrika had not sensed the 
presence of the Ruby of Alvara was because its power was not being used. 
On the Swiss Plateau, Johan and Arine overlooked Zurich. Arine had used 
the power of the Sapphire to lure the Jewel Summoners out. Using her 
power of empathy, Arine could say to Johan with little doubt, &quot;I don&#39;t 
think they know you&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; the Finn said. &quot;But when we find them, my presence will be felt 
quite fully.&quot; With that, Arine and Johan started their descent into 
Zurich.
