<h1>Birthright (part 4 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mascots/birthrite-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Pierre Doulin,&quot; the figure said as it approached the stunned professor. 
&quot;You know what this is,&quot; he said, holding up the Red Ruby of Alvara, 
&quot;don&#39;t you?&quot;

Professor Peridot knew that revealing his knowledge of Jewel Summoning 
to others could be detrimental. Acting ignorant, Peridot simply replied, 
&quot;It&#39;s a ruby.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t play dumb with me...&quot; said the figure. Then, he finished his 
sentence, referring to Peridot as, &quot;...Jewel Summoner.&quot; An expression of 
surprise came over the professor&#39;s face. &quot;Yes,&quot; said the figure, seeing 
Peridot&#39;s confused expression, &quot;I know your family history. I know that 
your clan has produced some of the most gifted Jewel Summoners the world 
has ever known.

Now knowing that feigning ignorance was ineffective, Peridot asked the 
tall man, &quot;What kind of Jewel Summoner are you?&quot;

Uproarious laughter came from the man&#39;s mouth at Peridot&#39;s question. 
&quot;Jewel Summoner...&quot; he said, acting as if peridot had just spoken the 
most absurd statement he had ever heard.

Despite the man&#39;s behavior, Peridot continued trying to get information 
from the dark figure that was standing over him. &quot;The Dagomars were in 
possession of the Red Ruby of Alvara the last I heard,&quot; said Peridot. 
&quot;Are you one of the Dagomar clan?&quot;

A sharp contrast to his previous tone, the man&#39;s next spoken words were 
gushing with rage. &quot;Do not mention the name &#39;Dagomar&#39; in my presence 
again!&quot; The man swung his arm around, calling forth another powerful 
force from the Red Ruby. Peridot was thrown headlong toward the man, and 
then was met with a hard punch to the face. The man was about to hit the 
professor with another attack from the Ruby, but Peridot managed to get 
out of the way before the attack hit.

Peridot reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a green apatite 
crystal. Using apatite&#39;s power of location, he used it to home in on the 
man he was fighting, allowing the crystal to propel him toward the man. 
Peridot was in striking range of the man when suddenly, with a flash of 
light from the Ruby, the man altered Peridot&#39;s perception of time, and 
instantly appeared behind Peridot, hitting the professor with another 
attack from the Ruby. Although face-down on the ground, Peridot swung 
his leg around, attempting to trip the man. However, he saw Peridot&#39;s 
attack coming and jumped to avoid the blow, landing with one foot 
crushing Peridot&#39;s outstretched leg. The professor cried out in pain as 
he felt the bone snap where the man&#39;s foot had landed.

&quot;You obviously do not know what you are up against,&quot; the man said, 
standing over a crippled Professor Peridot. &quot;Do you know any clan of 
Jewel Summoners that can control the power of the Red Ruby of Alvara?&quot;

The truth was beginning to dawn on the professor. &quot;You&#39;re no Jewel 
Summoner,&quot; he managed to choke out. &quot;You&#39;re a descendant of the elves!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m surprised it took you that long to realize it,&quot; said the man. 
Peridot knew that he needed a different tactic. He reached into his coat 
pocket and pulled out a golden-yellow crystal. The crystal glowed yellow 
as Peridot concentrated on it. After several moments, the glowing of the 
crystal stopped. The elfin descendant was confused. &quot;And what was that 
all about? What power does pyrite have, the power of entertaining light 
shows? I suppose the Doulins are not as skilled in the art of Jewel 
Summoning as I thought. As the man finished his degrading remark, he 
kicked Peridot, sending the injured man several feet away.

----------

Mia and Arine were awoken by a loud banging on their door. &quot;Mia! Arine!&quot; 
a frantic male voice cried from the other side. &quot;It&#39;s me, Sam! Are you 
there?&quot;

&quot;Is that Sam?&quot; Arine wondered, here eyes still hazy with sleep.

&quot;What the fuck is he doing here at this time of night?&quot; Mia said, very 
cranky.

The banging on the door continued. &quot;Please! This is an emergency!&quot; Sam 
cried.

Mia groggily stood up and walked to the door, opening it to look Sam in 
the eye. &quot;Sam,&quot; she said, &quot;what the fuck is wrong with you?&quot;

&quot;Professor Peridot is in danger,&quot; Sam replied.

&quot;What?&quot; Mia asked, not fully registering what Sam had said. What Sam did 
next caused both Mia and Arine to become wide-awake. He pulled out from 
his pants pocket a glowing pyrite crystal.

----------

The tall man picked up Professor Peridot by his shirt collar. Peridot 
tried to look into the man&#39;s face, but in the dark of night and 
distracted by the pain in his body, he could not make out the man&#39;s 
features.

&quot;Pierre,&quot; he said, &quot;you know where the elf is, don&#39;t you? You know 
everything there is to know about the Prophecy of Awakening. Tell me 
where he is!&quot;

&quot;What do you want with the elf?&quot; Peridot demanded.

&quot;Our clan lord has a deadly disease,&quot; the man explained. &quot;Only the elf 
has the power to cure him.&quot; Then, the man simply dropped Pierre. &quot;You 
don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like,&quot; he said, now with a hint of sadness in his 
voice. &quot;Seeing you uncle, lying there on his bed, completely 
unresponsive. You feel so helpless, not being able to do anything to 
help him.&quot; the man&#39;s voice filled with anger again. &quot;If it weren&#39;t for 
you Jewel Summoners, Lord Blake would not have to suffer this curse upon 
him.&quot;

Unable to know who his enemy was, Peridot could not understand what the 
man&#39;s intentions were. &quot;Who are you?&quot; the professor asked.

&quot;Do you not recognize my voice, Pierre?&quot; asked the man. &quot;Maybe you do, 
but you just don&#39;t want to accept the fact that one of your oldest 
friends is causing you this pain.&quot; With the man throwing the truth in 
the professor&#39;s face, Peridot began to realize the identity of the man 
that was speaking to him. &quot;Perhaps I should shed some light on the 
subject.&quot; The Ruby of Alvara started glowing and the man held it close 
to his face, allowing the glow of the crystal to illuminate his 
features. Peridot gasped as he saw the face of his assailant, his 
terrible suspicions about the man&#39;s identity painfully confirmed.

----------

Several miles away, Mia sped down the highway in her silver convertible. 
Arine was in the back seat, reserving the front seat for Sam. Sam was 
holding in his hand a glowing, green apatite crystal to guide them to 
the professor. Mia and Arine were still a little stunned that their best 
friend had such an important role.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell us you were a Jewel Summoner?&quot; Mia asked.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you would have believed me,&quot; Sam replied.

&quot;We believed Peridot when he gave us a demonstration this afternoon,&quot; 
said Arine.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think I had a reason to reveal my powers,&quot; the boy explained. 
&quot;I never heard of the Legend of Alvara until just a few days ago. I had 
no idea that Mia could be an elf. I simply accepted her pointed ears 
without a second thought.&quot;

&quot;Just like I did,&quot; said Arine, softly.

The apatite drew Sam in a different direction. &quot;Take this exit, he 
said.&quot; Mia did as Sam directed.

----------

Peridot stared in shock at the person that was in front of him. It was 
difficult to believe who it was that was attacking him. They had met in 
Europe 20 years before. And ever since then, Pierre&#39;s closest friend was 
Professor Johan Mustanen.

&quot;You never thought that I was a descendant of the elves, did you, 
Pierre?&quot; Mustanen said.

&quot;And I only thought you knew about Norse mythology because you were 
Finnish,&quot; Peridot said, still in a state of shock. &quot;But it&#39;s more than 
that,&quot; he realized. &quot;The Legend of Alvara itself has been passed down 
through your family line!&quot;

&quot;Now you know why I stuck by you all these years,&quot; Johan said. &quot;Ever 
since I learned that you were one of the Doulin clan, I knew that you 
would be the key to finding the elf.&quot; Again, Johan picked up Pierre by 
the shirt collar.&quot; And now, I ask you one last time. Where is he? Where 
is the elf?&quot;

Just then, Johan was caught off-guard by a thick fog suddenly appearing 
around them. Confused as to the cause, he dropped Pierre. Pierre, 
knowing that help had arrived, pulled out his apatite crystal. As the 
crystal began glowing green, it pulled Peridot toward where the fog was 
emanating. When he emerged from the fog, he found himself face to face 
with Mia, Arine, and Sam. Sam was holding a glowing, blue fluorite 
crystal, which was creating the fog. &quot;Samuel,&quot; he said, relieved. &quot;You 
got my message.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir Pierre,&quot; the young man replied. Then, a bright, red light came 
from within the cloud of fog. All of the fog was blown away in one gust, 
which had emanated from a glowing ruby, held by Mustanen. Mia, Arine, 
and Sam stared in surprise at the man holding the red crystal. 
&quot;Professor Mustanen?&quot; Sam was confused.

&quot;Well,&quot; said Johan. &quot;It seems we have a Junior Summoner.&quot; It was then 
that Johan realized what Pierre had done. &quot;So that&#39;s what pyrite is. It 
has the power of communication. Pierre must have sent you a message with 
that crystal he had with him. I never knew that the Lancestors were 
Jewel Summoners as well.&quot;

&quot;What is Mustanen doing here?&quot; Arine wondered.

&quot;Remember what I told you about humans being able to use elfin powers?&quot; 
said Pierre. &quot;Johan is one such individual.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that he has in his hand?&quot; Mia wondered, looking at the crystal 
that Johan held.

&quot;Oh my God!&quot; exclaimed Sam. &quot;It&#39;s the Red Ruby of Alvara!&quot;

&quot;Ah, so you know what this is,&quot; said Johan, slightly amused by the 
18-year-old boy&#39;s knowledge. &quot;Although you are clearly a Jewel Summoner, 
I didn&#39;t think that anyone as young as you would know the Legend of 
Alvara.&quot;

&quot;The Lancestor Clan is charged with reconnaissance duty,&quot; Sam explained. 
&quot;We are taught about the legend at an early age so that we may find the 
Legendary Elf.&quot;

As he heard Sam&#39;s words, a knowing, eager smile came across Johan&#39;s 
face, &quot;Which you have found already.&quot; The others were surprised by 
Johan&#39;s statement. &quot;I can feel the elf&#39;s presence. The Red Ruby is 
searching for him.&quot; Johan held the Ruby up for a moment and started 
swiveling his head about, as if searching for something. Then his head 
stopped swiveling and he looked strait ahead. &quot;It&#39;s searching for her!&quot; 
Everyone looked in the direction that Johan was, directly at Mia! &quot;I 
have foreseen this moment, Mia Carver,&quot; said Johan, approaching the 
brunette. &quot;I knew that I would find the elf and so I have! You are the 
one that holds the key to the future of my clan. Come with me and I will 
spare your friends.&quot;

Suddenly Arine jumped in front of Johan, coming in between him and Mia. 
&quot;Back off!&quot; Arine brazenly demanded.

&quot;Or else you&#39;ll do what?&quot; asked Johan, amused by Arine&#39;s valor. &quot;You are 
not a Jewel Summoner. You do not have the mystical elfin powers that I 
sense in your friend. What do you plan to do?&quot;

&quot;I plan to protect the person I love,&quot; was Arine&#39;s reply.

&quot;You&#39;ve been reading too many romance novels, Arine Sylven,&quot; Johan 
laughed. &quot;Love alone cannot stand up to the awesome power of the Red 
Ruby of Alvara!&quot; Johan held up the Ruby, which started glowing red. &quot;Now 
you will witness the true power that crystals possess.&quot; The glowing of 
the crystal grew brighter, letting Arine know that Johan was gathering 
energy to fire at her. Arine closed her eyes, but stood her ground. 
&quot;Die!&quot; said Johan as the energy in the crystal reached its limit.

A bright red flash came from Johan&#39;s vicinity. The force was enough to 
throw Johan to the ground. However, the force had not come from the 
Ruby. It had come from a giant soldier appearing in front of Johan, 
encased in armor made of glowing red crystal. It was protecting Arine 
and Mia! &quot;A crystal soldier?&quot; Johan said, alarmed by the colossal 
soldier standing over him. Johan then turned his attention to the 
injured man that was lying on the ground next to Sam. Pierre was holding 
a glowing, red spinel crystal! &quot;You summoned this monster!&quot; Johan 
realized.

Pierre said, &quot;Even with the power of corundum, the elves could not 
defeat it.&quot;

The giant soldier took a fighting stance, ready to charge at Johan. As 
the silver-haired man stood, Pierre sent his crystal soldier after the 
Finn. Johan held up the Ruby, again gathering power. A blinding flash 
emanated from the ruby as the crystal soldier reached him. Everyone was 
caught off guard by the bright light that the Ruby of Alvara was giving 
off. When the light subsided, Johan was nowhere to be seen.

&quot;He&#39;s gone...&quot; Sam said.

Mia was still wide-eyed with panic. &quot;He--He knew I was the elf?&quot; she 
stammered.

The brunette fell to her knees, her breathing shallow and labored. 
&quot;Mia!&quot; Arine cried, grabbing Mia and holding her tight. Sam rushed to 
Mia&#39;s side as well. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mia. Mustanen&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;Arine and I are here to protect you,&quot; said Sam. &quot;You&#39;re safe now.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re both going to make sure that nothing happens to you, Mia,&quot; said 
Arine, hoping that she and Sam could help calm Mia down before her heart 
put out. &quot;I promise I won&#39;t let anyone hurt you.&quot;

Slowly but surely, Mia&#39;s heart rate slowed and her breathing returned to 
normal. Both Arine and Sam gave a deep sigh of relief, knowing that they 
had prevented Mia from having another cardiac episode. &quot;Are you all 
right, Mia?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mia said softly, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine. For a moment I thought I was 
going to have another attack. Thank you, both of you.&quot; Mia embraced both 
Sam and Arine, happy that she was still alive after the incident with 
Professor Mustanen.

However, the mood suddenly changed as Sam sensed something was wrong. He 
looked at where Johan was to see the crystal soldier disappear in front 
of his very eyes. The boy then turned to Pierre to see that he had 
fainted. &quot;Sir Pierre!&quot; Sam cried, rushing to the man&#39;s side. After 
making sure that Mia was fine, Arine followed Sam to Pierre&#39;s side. &quot;He 
must have used up too much energy by using spinel,&quot; said Sam.

&quot;He also took a beating from Mustanen,&quot; Arine added.

&quot;We have to get him to a hospital!&quot; exclaimed Sam.

Looking at Pierre&#39;s condition, Arine said, &quot;I don&#39;t think he has enough 
time to get to a hospital.&quot;

&quot;We have to try!&quot; Sam cried.

&quot;Wait,&quot; said Arine. &quot;Do you have any quartz on you?&quot;

&quot;Quartz crystal?&quot; Sam reached into Pierre&#39;s coat pockets, rummaging for 
any kind of quartz crystal. Finally, he managed to pull out a purple 
amethyst. Sam looked at the crystal in his hand, not knowing if he was 
able to use a crystal with a hardness as high as seven. He said, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know if I have the training necessary to use a crystal as powerful 
as quartz.&quot;

&quot;If you don&#39;t, Peridot is going to die!&quot; Arine cried. Knowing that he 
had no choice, Sam held the crystal over Pierre&#39;s body and concentrated 
on it. The amethyst started glowing purple as Sam used its power. The 
power of quartz was working! However, after a few moments, the glowing 
of the amethyst started flickering. Sam tried using more effort to keep 
the power of the quartz stable. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Arine asked, seeing the 
stress in Sam&#39;s facial expression.

&quot;I&#39;m only a Summoner in training,&quot; Sam choked out. &quot;I can&#39;t heal Sir 
Pierre&#39;s wounds by myself.&quot;

&quot;If I can help in any way--&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t,&quot; Sam interrupted. &quot;Only Jewel Summoners can use the power of 
quartz.

Just then, in that moment of despair, Mia somehow found in herself the 
strength to stand. The brunette staggered to her feet and started 
walking toward Pierre, each step becoming stronger and steadier. 
Although nobody was watching to notice grains of sand sparkling in Mia&#39;s 
hair, Sam did sense something unusual. Before Sam could determine what 
it was that he sensed, Mia walked up behind him and put her hand to the 
crystal that he was holding. As she did so, the flickering of the purple 
glow stopped and it turned to a steady glow that was unusually bright. 
Arine could not believe it. Mia was helping Sam use the powers locked 
inside a crystal!

Peridot began to regain consciousness. As he did, Sam and Mia used up 
all of the strength they could from using the power of quartz. The 
glowing of the amethyst stopped and Sam and Mia both collapsed to the 
ground. &quot;Mia! Sam!&quot; cried Arine.

&quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; said Sam softly. A moment later, Sam managed to sit up.

&quot;Are you all right, Mia?&quot; Arine asked.

&quot;I&#39;m tired,&quot; Mia could say in no more than a whisper.

Arine took one of Mia&#39;s hands in her own. Trying to give strength 
through their contact, Arine asked, &quot;So you think you can drive Sir 
Pierre to the campus medical center?&quot;

Mia managed to sit up. &quot;I can try,&quot; she said weakly.

Arine and Sam then helped Pierre to a sitting position. &quot;Are you all 
right, Sir Pierre?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;I think so,&quot; the middle-aged man said. Looking at Sam and Mia, he 
asked, &quot;Did you use my amethyst crystal to help me?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sam replied, still a little surprised at Mia&#39;s newfound ability. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t have enough power to use it, but somehow, Mia was able to help 
me.&quot;

&quot;It must be the mystical energies she has as an elf,&quot; Pierre suggested 
an explanation.

&quot;Can you walk, Sir Pierre?&quot; asked Arine. Pierre tried to stand, but 
blinding pain shot up and down his leg, causing him to collapse and 
groan in agony. Sam and Arine draped Pierre&#39;s arms over their shoulders 
and they helped him to the car, Pierre hobbling on his one good leg. Mia 
jumped into the driver&#39;s seat and started the engine. As Arine and Sam 
laid Pierre down in the back seat, they got in the car as well and Mia 
drove off back toward campus.

----------

As Mia, Arine, Sam, and Pierre entered the campus medical center, the 
receptionist was astounded to see the condition that the middle-aged man 
was in. &quot;My God!&quot; the receptionist cried. &quot;What happened to you?&quot;

Pierre was about to answer when Sam butted in, &quot;I think he had a bit too 
much to drink.&quot; Pierre looked at Sam, surprised by the statement. &quot;We 
were out partying,&quot; Sam continued, &quot;and he fell down a flight of 
stairs.&quot; Pierre rolled his eyes, insulted by the story that Sam was 
telling.

&quot;I&#39;ll show you to the emergency room,&quot; said the receptionist. The 
receptionist led Mia to the emergency room and Arine and Sam followed, 
carrying Pierre.

As the doctors checked Pierre&#39;s condition, the three friends waited in 
the lounge. &quot;Nice thinking there, Samuel,&quot; said Mia in a sarcastic tone.

&quot;What did you expect me to say?&quot; Sam asked, just as sharp. &quot;That he was 
beat up by an elf and then used too much energy using the power of a 
crystal against him?&quot;

&quot;We all know full well that Professor Peridot doesn&#39;t go partying with 
us!&quot;

&quot;Stop it!&quot; Arine cried. Sam and Mia turned their attention to the teller 
girl, surprised by how assertive she had been all night. &quot;This isn&#39;t the 
time to be arguing,&quot; Arine continued. &quot;Right now, we have a dangerous 
man out there, trying to capture Mia! Peridot was barely able to summon 
a crystal soldier before he passed out. What is that compared to an 
elfin descendant with the power of corundum? And the Red Ruby of Alvara 
no less!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, Arine,&quot; said Mia. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be throwing sarcastic 
remarks at each other. We all have to work together if we are to get 
through this.&quot;

&quot;This past week has been full of surprises,&quot; said Sam, partially to 
himself. &quot;First, Mia has her attack. Soon afterwards, my parents teach 
my the Legend of Alvara. Then, I find out that Mia is the elf that the 
Prophecy of Awakening speaks of. And now...&quot; Sam trailed off a moment to 
catch his breath. &quot;...now, Mustanen is the most dangerous person to us.&quot;

&quot;What I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Arine said, &quot;is what Mustanen wants with 
Mia.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t he say something about the key to the future of his clan?&quot; Mia 
asked.

&quot;What is it with all these clans, anyway?&quot; Arine wondered.

Sam explained, &quot;The clans are families and extended families that have 
survived for hundreds of years. Knowledge of the family&#39;s origins is 
passed down from generation to generation. This knowledge may include 
the Legend of Alvara, the history of the elves, or even something as 
simple as Jewel Summoning. Each clan of Jewel Summoners has been charged 
with some duty relating to the fulfillment of the Prophecy of Awakening. 
The Lancestor Clan is meant to be on the lookout for anything that could 
lead to the discovery of the elf. Aside from what happens inside my own 
clan, I don&#39;t know much.&quot;

&quot;But Peridot sent you a message with one of his crystals,&quot; Mia said,

&quot;Iron pyrite,&quot; said the boy. &quot;All of the Jewel Summoner clans are kept 
in contact through the power of pyrite. It has the power to communicate 
thoughts to other people with the crystal. Thoughts are usually not as 
coherent as words, but they can be communicated much more quickly than 
by phone. Pierre knew that I was close to you two. That&#39;s probably why 
he contacted me.&quot;

&quot;I take it you know nothing about how the elf is supposed to completely 
awaken,&quot; Arine guessed.

Sam replied, &quot;All I know is that it has something to do with the Red 
Ruby and Blue Sapphire of Alvara. Beyond that, I know nothing about the 
Prophecy of Awakening.&quot;

&quot;The Doulin Clan protects the Sapphire,&quot; Mia said, remembering what 
Pierre had told her and Arine.

Although Mia&#39;s statement was seemingly mundane, Sam suddenly became very 
interested in what Mia had said. &quot;Really?&quot; he inquired.

Before Mia could reply, a doctor exited from the emergency room. &quot;Are 
you three Pierre&#39;s friends?&quot; he asked the group.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sam replied.

&quot;Aside from a broken leg,&quot; the doctor explained Pierre&#39;s condition, 
&quot;Pierre only has a few cuts and bruises. He should be good as new in 
about eight weeks.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Doctor,&quot; said Arine.

&quot;We wants to speak with you three,&quot; the doctor said.

&quot;Us?&quot; Mia inquired.

&quot;He said that it was urgent he spoke with you.&quot;

Arine, Mia, and Sam stood up and the doctor led them to the recovery 
ward. Pierre was sitting up in bed. His leg was elevated and several 
bandages where adhered to his forehead and arms. &quot;Good, you&#39;re here,&quot; 
Pierre said as he saw the three friends enter the room.

&quot;Thank you, Doctor,&quot; said Sam. &quot;We&#39;ll take it from here.&quot; The doctor 
nodded and exited the room. The group walked to the side of Pierre&#39;s 
bed. &quot;What was it you wanted to talk to us about?&quot; Sam asked. Pierre&#39;s 
response was a good smack to the side of Sam&#39;s head. &quot;Ow! Jeez!&quot; Sam 
cried. &quot;What the hell did you do that for?!&quot;

&quot;Had too much to drink, did I?&quot; said Pierre. The three friends laughed 
nervously as Sam rubbed the bump that Pierre had raised. Becoming 
serious again, Pierre said, &quot;The Mustanen Clan should not be in 
possession of the Red Ruby of Alvara. Protection of the Ruby was the 
Dagomar Clan&#39;s duty.&quot;

&quot;How did they get a hold of the Ruby then?&quot; Sam wondered.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;We will have to meet with the clan lords, 
find out exactly what has been happening.&quot;

&quot;Meet them?&quot; Mia asked.

&quot;But all of the clan lords are in Europe,&quot; Sam said.

&quot;We have no choice, Samuel,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;Right now, we know next to 
nothing about recent events pertaining to the elves. We must go to 
Europe and convene.&quot;

&quot;How long would a trip like this take?&quot; Arine asked. &quot;My parents call me 
once a week to check up on me.&quot;

&quot;I do not believe your presence will be necessary, Arine,&quot; said Pierre.

&quot;If the Mustanen Clan comes after Mia again,&quot; said Arine, holding the 
brunette in her arms, &quot;I won&#39;t be able to protect her if I&#39;m not there.&quot;

&quot;Arine...&quot; Mia said, still surprised by her girlfriend&#39;s determination.

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t take more than a few days,&quot; Sam replied to Arine. &quot;All we 
have to do is go to Europe, meet with the clan members, then go back. No 
one will know.&quot;

&quot;The Jewel Summoners would be more than willing to bear the cost of such 
a trip,&quot; Pierre said.

&quot;My parents should be calling tomorrow,&quot; Arine said. &quot;If we leave the 
day after, we should have no problems.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;We should all get some rest. I&#39;m sorry I had to 
wake you all in the middle of the night.&quot;

&quot;We understand, Pierre,&quot; said Mia.

&quot;The medical center will discharge me tomorrow morning after they have 
done a few more tests,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;I will see if I can arrange a 
flight for the four of us.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Sir Pierre,&quot; said Sam.

&quot;Miss Carver?&quot; said the Frenchman.

&quot;Yes, Pierre?&quot; the brunette asked.

&quot;You put up with a lot tonight. You were under stress three times. 
First, you did not get a full night&#39;s sleep. Then, you were surprised 
when Johan realized you were the elf, which must have put almost enough 
stress on your heart to give you another episode. And then, you used 
even more energy to help Samuel heal my serious injuries. Yet, you were 
still able to drive me all the way to the hospital. How is that?&quot;

Mia then realized that Pierre was right. She had shown amazing strength 
that someone with her condition should not have been able to have. &quot;I&#39;m 
not sure,&quot; she replied.

Sam added, &quot;Just before Mia helped heal you, I thought I sensed 
something.&quot;

&quot;Was it a change in the mystical energies of the world?&quot; Pierre asked 
very intently.

&quot;It might have been,&quot; Sam said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t have enough 
training to know exactly what it was I sensed.&quot;

&quot;Mia&#39;s elfin powers are continuing to awaken,&quot; Pierre realized. &quot;She is 
finding the strength to handle the ill effects of her heart condition.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re still weakened, right?&quot; Arine asked the shorter girl. Mia 
simply nodded.

&quot;We could all use some rest,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;You three should go home and 
regain your strength. The next few days are bound to be strenuous.&quot;

&quot;Good night, Pierre,&quot; said Mia. &quot;Or should I say, &#39;Good morning&#39;?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll meet you all tomorrow,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;The Science Hall at 
five&#39;o&#39;clock?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; said Arine.

&quot;Rest well,&quot; the older man said.

The three friends said in unison, &quot;Will do.&quot;

----------

After driving Sam back to his house off-campus, Mia drove herself and 
Arine back to their dorm room. As she entered the room, Mia threw 
herself down on her bed, exhausted. &quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll be able to get 
up in the morning,&quot; she sighed.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, Mia,&quot; said Arine, lying down next to the 
brown-haired girl. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t worry about classes tomorrow. Let&#39;s 
just worry about getting a good night&#39;s rest.&quot;

Mia curled up next to Arine and wrapped her arms around the blonde. &quot;I 
love you so much, Arine,&quot; she said. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to ever leave my 
side.&quot;

Arine embraced Mia, comforting her frightened friend. &quot;I never will, my 
love,&quot; Arine said in a soothing tone. &quot;Never.&quot; Arine and Mia fell asleep 
in each other&#39;s comforting embrace.

----------

5:00 pm the next day. Mia, Arine, and Sam entered the science hall to 
confirm their plans with Pierre. Pierre was in the lecture hall, waiting 
for them. His leg had been put in a cast and he was using a pair of 
crutches to balance himself on his unbroken leg. &quot;Good, we&#39;re all here,&quot; 
said the professor at seeing the three friends enter.

&quot;Do we have an itinerary for our trip to Europe?&quot; Arine asked.

Sam said, &quot;Sir Pierre and my parents had a talk with the other clans 
this morning. We have arranged to leave tomorrow at ten AM. We will 
switch flights in New York, and then fly to Switzerland. As you can 
expect, my parents will be joining us.&quot;

&quot;Oh, wow,&quot; said Mia, feeling nostalgic. &quot;It&#39;ll be nice to see them again 
after all these years.&quot; Mia turned to Arine and said, &quot;Sam&#39;s parents are 
some of the nicest people I&#39;ve ever met. I didn&#39;t see them much because 
they were always away on...&quot; Mia trailed off, realizing the falsity of 
what Sam&#39;s parents had told them when they left them with Mia&#39;s parents. 
&quot;Were your parents always away on business?&quot; Mia asked her childhood 
friend.

&quot;I used to think they were,&quot; Sam replied. &quot;It was only after the move 
that they told me the truth about the origins of the Lancestor Clan. 
Just a single flight across the Atlantic would get them to Europe if a 
clan meeting was arranged.&quot;

&quot;And that is precisely what has happened,&quot; said Pierre.

&quot;What about transportation?&quot; Arine asked.

&quot;I can drive everyone to the airport,&quot; Mia volunteered.

&quot;That would be perfect,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;I will be staying at Sam&#39;s house 
until mine is rebuilt.&quot; Mention of his house&#39;s destruction reminded him 
of the assailant. &quot;What I can&#39;t understand why Johan was so aggressive 
with me.&quot;

&quot;He wanted to get to me,&quot; Mia said. &quot;He knew that you were the Jewel 
Summoner that would take him to the elf. If he could put enough pressure 
on you, you would undoubtedly call upon the services of a Jewel Summoner 
on reconnaissance duty.&quot;

&quot;But how could Johan have been so accurate in his predictions?&quot; Arine 
wondered.

&quot;He must have the ability of foresight,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;It is an ability 
that elves have been rumored to possess.&quot;

&quot;How are we going to get past such an advantage?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;From what I have been told,&quot; said Pierre, &quot;the Valentino Clan 
specializes in diversion. Perhaps they can use their abilities to block 
the Mustanen Clan&#39;s foresight.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Arine said. &quot;Or else keeping Mia safe will be difficult.&quot;

&quot;All of the clan members are on high alert,&quot; Pierre reassured. &quot;The clan 
meeting will take place in Zurich. There is a large, underground shelter 
that the clans use for their meetings. It keeps outsiders from 
obstructing our duties as Jewel Summoners.&quot;

&quot;But we can&#39;t spend our entire trip underground, can we?&quot; Mia said 
enthusiastically. &quot;This is Europe we&#39;re talking about! So many 
historical landmarks. Big Ben, the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think you should get too excited about this, Mia,&quot; Arine 
intervened. &quot;Your heart might not be able to take it.&quot;

&quot;Arine,&quot; Mia said with a hint of sadness in her voice, &quot;my weak heart is 
the reason I&#39;m so excited. Who knows the next time I&#39;ll be able to see 
Europe? I have to make the most of what little time I might have left.&quot;

There was a pause as Arine suddenly realized Mia&#39;s nature. &quot;It never 
occurred to me why you were always so outgoing, so energetic,&quot; the 
blonde said, close to tears. &quot;Now I know.&quot; Arine embraced her friend 
tightly. &quot;We&#39;ll go see the landmarks together,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Thank you, Arine,&quot; said Mia, tears in her eyes as well.

There was another pause as the two Jewel Summoners watched the 
tear-jerking scene in front of them. Even Sam was close to tears as 
well. &quot;So,&quot; he said, trying to change the subject, &quot;are we just going to 
stand here all day, soaking up sap? This is all too lovey-dovey for me.&quot; 
Sam&#39;s statement was amusing, but the most everyone could do was smile.

&quot;I have the tickets right here,&quot; Pierre said, pulling 3 plane tickets 
out of his pants pocket. Mia, Arine, and Sam took the tickets from 
Pierre. &quot;You must remember your tickets AND your passports,&quot; Pierre 
said.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Sir Pierre,&quot; Mia said. &quot;We will.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Pierre said, &quot;now that everything seems to be in order, would 
anyone mind driving me to Sam&#39;s home?&quot; The four of them laughed slightly 
and then exited the lecture hall.

----------

Mia and Arine picked up Sam and Pierre at 7:15 the next morning. After 
having breakfast at the airport, the four of them boarded Flight 103 to 
New York City. Pierre had a window seat while Mia got an isle seat. 
Arine and Sam were in between Mia and Pierre. After they had taken off, 
a stewardess came by to serve drinks. Mia and Arine ordered colas and 
Sam ordered a ginger ale while Pierre only ordered a glass of water.

As Mia, Arine, and Sam talked among themselves, Pierre simply sipped his 
water, looking thoughtfully out the window at the clouds below him. 
&#39;Johan,&#39; Pierre thought. &#39;Why have you turned against me?&#39;

Meanwhile, Johan Mustanen was at his house, watching an airplane fly 
overhead. He then looked at the Red Ruby that he held in his hand. &#39;I 
promise I will make the Jewel Summoners pay,&#39; the Finn thought to 
himself. &#39;By the Red Ruby of Alvara, I will see to it that they suffer 
for what they did to my kind. Every last Jewell Summoner will pay.&#39;</pre>
