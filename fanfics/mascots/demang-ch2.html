fanfiction by <a href="../authors/link4.html">Link48010</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mascots/demang-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Arine woke up lying in an awkward position. She looked out the window to 
her left to make sure it was morning, and then stretched. As the pushed 
her arms out she hit something heavy. She looked over to see Mia sound 
asleep with a peaceful look on her face. &quot;What&#39;s going one here,&quot; She 
said to herself. She softly moved out of bed as not to wake Mia. &quot;I 
guess she couldn&#39;t sleep in that cot in the end anyway.&quot; Arine went down 
to the kitchen to get something to eat. As she was preparing a sandwich 
with some meat, Mia came around the corner. 

&quot;Good morning,&quot; she yawned. 

&quot;It&#39;s about time you woke up,&quot; said Arine sarcastically. 

&quot;Hay, I&#39;ve been through a lot just recently,&quot; she retorted. 

&quot;Hahaha, I know, and I&#39;m just joking with you.&quot; 

&quot;So what&#39;s for breakfast?&quot; asked Mia. 

&quot;Well, here&#39;s some turkey breast, some cheese, and some bread. I don&#39;t 
know about you but I thinking sandwiches.&quot; 

As they ate breakfast Mia couldn&#39;t stop looking at Arine. For some 
reason she just couldn&#39;t take her eyes away from those deep blue eyes of 
Arine&#39;s. Before Arine could figure out why Mia spoke up. 

&quot;You have the prettiest eyes Arine.&quot; 

&quot;A... Why thank you,&quot; replied Arine, blushing heavily. 

&quot;Arine, what does &quot;Winden Sie Blatt&quot; mean?&quot; asked Mia. 

Arine looked towards at Mia with a surprised look on her face. &quot;It means 
wind blade, but how do you know that. That is ancient angelic language 
used for magic. 

&quot;I don&#39;t really know how I knew it. Anyways, any chance of getting you 
to show me some magic today. Oh and also, I was wondering what you do 
for a job, because I wanted to help you out if I could.&quot; 

The girls ventured out into Arine&#39;s back yard, which faced the ocean. 
The sand was pure white and got in Mia&#39;s sandals no matter how much she 
lifted up her feet. In the end she decided to mimic Arine and leave her 
sandals behind. The sand was perfectly clean and pleasantly warm on the 
souls of her feet. 

Arine stopped about a hundred feet from the house and faced the ocean 
where she just stood there for a few minutes. She didn&#39;t move, and as 
far as Mia could tell, not even breathing. With no notion she moved both 
arms straight out in front of her, palms pointing toward each other. She 
then pulled them back, putting her left hand over her right. Her palms 
where still towards each other like she was holding an orb or something. 
With a flash she switched her hand so the right was over the left. She 
put her arms down towards her right hip and leaned back, her hands 
hitting the sand. As she moved her hands back up to her chest, both 
hands pointing vertical, the sand seemed to be moving inside her hands. 
It was as if the sand was being blown around, but wouldn&#39;t go outside of 
her hands. &quot;Winden Sie Blatt!&quot; She half yelled. Pointing both hand 
straight out a tornado like gale emerged from her hands. It curved down 
and picked up huge amounts of sand from the beach into it&#39;s spiraling 
funnel. The tornado continued to reach out at a pace Mia could run at. 
It reached about fifty yards out before it stopped and finally fell down 
into the water. 

&quot;Oh my God. That was incredible, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it,&quot; 
exclaimed Mia. 

&quot;Well before we get to carried away I just want you to know that that 
was the best I could do. I always was naturally gifted, but I still have 
my limits. If I where to try anything bigger I could lose control and my 
life force could be engulfed by the energy needed to use the spell. That 
is the reason angel&#39;s can use spells, we can control our energy far 
better than any other living thing. We can even store energy in our 
bodies until latter, which is why I stood there for so long. This is 
also the reason that there are no solo magicians, if the magic user 
where to run to low on energy than another magician or warrior must 
defend him or her till they build that energy back up.&quot; Explained Arine. 

&quot;Okay I get it. You said that language was &quot;ancient&quot;, correct, than why 
don&#39;t you use our speech instead of learning said language?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure, I suppose only very wise magicians know that. I don&#39;t 
know, for some reason our language just simply doesn&#39;t work.&quot; 

&quot;So how much of the language do you know?&quot; 

&quot;Ich liebe sie,&quot; said Arine with a giggle. 

&quot;Cool...what dose it mean? 

&quot;...&quot; 

&quot;Arine, what does it mean?&quot; said Mia with a ticked off look on her face. 

&quot;I&#39;m not telling you, you can look it up in one of my books. If you can 
than I&#39;ll teach you much more.&quot; 

&quot;Like what?&quot; said Mia with a quizzical look. 

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know, maybe some more funny phrases.&quot; 

&quot;Ah ha, thanks for my first clue, it&#39;s a funny phrase. You said more, 
which means that the first one is a &quot;funny&quot; phrase.&quot; 

&quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t really a...&quot; Arine trailed off as Mia fumed over what 
the phrase could mean. 

The two girls slowly walked in, Mia still trailing behind Arine. Arine 
was wondering exactly how seriously Mia would take her comment. Ich 
liebe sie literally meant I love you. Arine was scared that Mia might 
take the phrase the wrong way, or not take it seriously enough. She 
might just blow it off completely. As they got inside Mia asked what 
Arine does she do for a living. 

&quot;Well, call me pampered, but not a thing. My parents send money for me 
to live by when they finish a job. I&#39;m not very needy so they still 
don&#39;t need to send much.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, you said to so... Pampered pet!&quot; Mia yelled out and burst out in 
speed through the hallway. 

&quot;Why you little...&quot; Arine yelled as she gave chase. Mia was so fast. At 
the rate she was going Arine could never catch her. 

She didn&#39;t. She found Mia sitting on her bed. 

&quot;What took you so long?&quot; Mia said sarcastically. 

&quot;Fine then, you&#39;ll get yours... RIGHT NOW!&quot; Arine yelled as she jumped 
the four feet between her and the bed, landing on Mia and grabbing her 
around her slim waist. Arine wrestled with the brunette for several 
minutes but the demon gained the upper hand and got Arine under her. Mia 
held Arine&#39;s arms at her sides with her knees and began to tickle Arine 
with her free hands. 

&quot;NO, no, no, no, stop *giggle* it *giggle*.&quot; Arine blurted out. 
&quot;Hahaha... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Only if you tell me what ich liebe sie means.&quot; 

&quot;No *giggle* way.&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s the way you want it?&quot; Said Mia adding more speed to 
her hands. 

&quot;Okay *laugh* okay,&quot; said Arine as Mia got off of her. 

Regaining her composer she said &quot;It means,&quot; said Arine pausing to build 
suspense, &quot;something true.&quot; 

&quot;Hay, that&#39;s not fair,&quot; snapped back Mia. 

&quot;You said to tell you what it means, it means something true,&quot; said the 
Angel. Mia looked at the witty angel with a frustrated look. 

&quot;Oh all right then. I&#39;ll find out what it means on my own. Now where&#39;s 
all of your books on how to read the &quot;ancient&quot; language.&quot; 

&quot;Up there,&quot; pointed Arine pointing at the top shelf of a seven-foot tall 
bookshelf. 

&quot;Now you&#39;ve got to be kidding, how the hell am I supposed to get up 
there,&quot; moaned Mia. 

&quot;There is a built in ladder on the left side of the self Mia. Now if you 
could only learn how to use your eyes,&quot; Arine laughed to herself. 
Immediately Mia got down several books from the self and started reading 
to find out what the meaning Arine&#39;s phrase was, and while Mia did this 
Arine took and nap. Using that spell this morning took more out of her 
than she had let on to believe. &quot;How did she gain the upper hand in our 
brawl so easily? She flipped me over like I was no more that a feather. 
I bet she&#39;s great in bed... No, don&#39;t think like that Arine, I need to 
wait to see what her reaction to that phrase is before I can think 
things like that yet,&quot; thought Arine to herself as she lay in bed. She 
liked Mia, and liked her more and more with every passing minute. She 
couldn&#39;t call it love, at least not yet. She looked out of her door to 
the closed study door where Mia would sooner or latter figure out that 
Arine had confessed to her. Arine knew that Mia would figure it out 
because the ancient language was fairly easy to learn. 

Unable to sleep Arine just laid there in bed, thinking, mostly about 
Mia. She was just so beautiful that Arine couldn&#39;t get her mind off of 
her. &quot;I wonder if she would like to sleep in my bed with me again,&quot; 
Arine thought. How wonderful it would be to have the beautiful Demon 
lying next to her. Holding her until morning. She looked out the window; 
it must have been about three hours since the separated. Arine was 
starting to feel lonely. It happened every second she was away from the 
girl. She could stay alone for hours without feeling this way, but know 
she couldn&#39;t stand it. She slowly sat up and got out of bed. She started 
to walk out of her room towards the study and reached out for the 
doorknob. She held the doorknob and leaned up against the door to listen 
for any sounds... She heard a tapping sound, realizing it was footsteps. 
Before she could react the door flew open, smacking her right in the 
face. She fell down with a soft thump that Mia didn&#39;t hear. 

&quot;Arine, Arine, where are you?&quot; the demon yelled out, running past Arine 
and down the hall. 

&quot;I&#39;m back here,&quot; she yelled back. 

&quot;Oh, there you are. I... What are you doing on the floor? Well anyways, 
I got two words figured out. Ich means I, and sie means you. What liebe 
means I have yet to figure out.&quot; 

Arine got up trying to ignore her stinging nose. 

&quot;Let me see what books you are using.&quot; 

They walked into the study where Arine looked through all of books that 
Mia had used. 

&quot;Well here&#39;s your Problem (No I&#39;m not copying Adam from the Myth 
Busters), you aren&#39;t using the translations book. The one right there,&quot; 
said Arine as she pointed to a book on the top shelf. &quot;That book has 
thousands of straight translations and word meanings in it. It&#39;s like a 
dictionary for two languages, and it shows the ancient language right 
next to its normal counterpart.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s nice to know, you couldn&#39;t have mentioned this earlier.&quot; 

&quot;You never asked,&quot; replied Arine in a smart ass way. 

&quot;Thanks a lot, but that&#39;s what I like about you Arine, you work like a 
machine. Unless I put in, I don&#39;t get out.&quot; 

&quot;I think I&#39;ll give you one more hour to find out what liebe means. I&#39;ll 
be in my room if you need me.&quot; 

Once again they went into different rooms. While Mia looked up the 
finally and most important word in the phrase, Arine thought about what 
she would say depending on what Mia&#39;s reaction would be. Mia came into 
the room with a strange look on her face, and Arine knew that she had 
figured out what liebe meant, love. 

&quot;Mia,&quot; was all that Arine got out before Mia came up and hugged her 
tightly. Arine forgot about what she was going to say and fell backwards 
onto the bed. They laid there for several minutes until Mia looked up 
and Arine. 

&quot;Did you really mean that?&quot; 

&quot;Of course I did, have I ever lied to you?&quot; answered Arine. 

They looked at each other for several minutes. Mia looking into Arine&#39;s 
deep soulful eyes. Mia then leaned forward, her lips meeting the blonds. 
They where so soft. The kiss started slow but soon Mia slowly used her 
tongue to slowly explore Arine&#39;s mouth. The two girls laid there for 
several minutes kissing slowly. Arine&#39;s tongue meet Mia&#39;s. Their tongues 
danced around each other for several minutes. The kiss ended though. 

&quot;Would you still like me to teach you some more of the ancient 
language?&quot; Asked Arine. 

&quot;I&#39;d like that. I&#39;d like that very much.&quot; Replied Mia, resting her face 
on Arine&#39;s chest. 

&quot;Okay this is one of my favorite songs, I just hope I&#39;m not too far of 
key,&quot; stated Arine. 

&quot;Machen Sie, mein verloren gegangener Sohn weiter; es wird Frieden 
geben, wenn Sie gemacht sind. Legen Sie Ihren m&#129;den Kopf zu ruhen; macht 
Sie weinen kein mehr nicht. Nachdem ich &#129;ber dem Ger,usch und die 
Verwirrung nur gestiegen bin, einen Blick &#129;ber hinaus diese Illusion zu 
erhalten. Ich schwang mich je h&quot;her empor, aber ich bin zu hoch 
geflogen. Obwohl meine Augen sehen k&quot;nnten, war ich noch ein blinder 
Mann. Obwohl mein Gem&#129;t denken k&quot;nnte, war ich noch ein Wahnsinnige. Ich 
h&quot;re die Stimmen, wenn ich tr,ume. Ich kann h&quot;ren, dass sie sagen: 
Machen Sie meinen verloren gegangenen Sohn weiter; es wird Frieden 
geben, wenn Sie gemacht sind. Legen Sie Ihren m&#129;den Kopf zu ruhen; macht 
Sie weinen kein mehr nicht. Geben als ein Mann mit einem Grund aus, ist 
meine Scharade das Ereignis von der Jahreszeit. Und wenn ich 
beanspruche, ein weiser Mann zu sein, bedeutet es sicherlich, dass ich 
nicht wei . Auf einer st&#129;rmischen See, Gef&#129;hle zu bewegen, ich bin wie 
ein Schiff auf dem Ozean werden herumgewerft. Ich habe einen Kurs f&#129;r 
Winde des Verm&quot;gens gesetzt, aber ich h&quot;re, dass die Stimmen sagen: 
Machen Sie, mein verloren gegangener Sohn weiter; es wird Frieden geben, 
wenn Sie gemacht sind. Legen Sie Ihren m&#129;den Kopf zu ruhen; macht Sie 
weinen kein mehr nicht. Machen Sie, Sie immer werden sich erinnern an 
weiter. Machen Sie, weiter gleicht nichts der Pracht. Jetzt Ihres Lebens 
nicht mehr leer; sicherlich Himmel wartet auf Sie. Machen Sie, mein 
verloren gegangener Sohn weiter; es wird Frieden geben, wenn Sie gemacht 
sind. Legen Sie Ihren m&#129;den Kopf zu ruhen; macht Sie weinen kein mehr 
nicht.&quot; Sung Arine. The whole time Mia was entranced by Arine&#39;s 
beautiful voice, and the way the words seemed to flow through the air. 
She wanted to hear it again but decided not to pressure Arine anymore. 

&quot;Arine, that was beautiful, what was that?&quot; Said Mia in a delicate tone. 

&quot;Thank you Mia, it was my pleasure. Mia...I...&quot; Arine stuttered. Mia put 
a finger on Arine&#39;s lips to quiet her. 

&quot;Lets just get some sleep Arine. We&#39;ll talk in the morning.&quot; 

&quot;Goodnight Mia,&quot; Arine said softly. 

&quot;Goodnight to you too Arine,&quot; replied Mia. 

Together they laid there and fell asleep, and unlike last night, they 
fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms. &quot;I wish this would never end. I feel 
so at home here. I hope we can... well I hope she loves me as much as I 
love her,&quot; thought Arine as she fell asleep, Mia in her embrace. Mia was 
tightly hugging her above her hips, her face buried in Arine&#39;s breasts. 
&quot;No one will get in my way. I will have Arine. That is a promise, a 
promise to you Arine. I&#39;ll love you in anyway I can.&quot; 

Author&#39;s notes 

Ich liebe sie is German for I love you. 

The poem that Arine sings is actually a German translation of the song 
&quot;Carry On My Wayward Son&quot;. </pre>
