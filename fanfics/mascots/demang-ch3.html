<a href="../mascots/demang-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>      For both of the two girls their dreams where very vivid that 
night. Their shared dream wasn&#39;t just about them being together; it went 
a few steps farther.

&quot;Oh Arine...&quot; Moaned Mia as Arine&#39;s hand worked its magic between her 
legs. She looked into Arine&#39;s deep blue eyes, love and compassion 
radiating from her features.

      &quot;Ich will... Ich will du... (I want you),&quot; coned Arine as she 
continued to caress Mia. For some reason able to understand the Angel 
she shouted, &quot;oh Arine, you have me, you have me! You have every inch of 
me!&quot; Mia reached her peak with huge amounts of force, her body racked by 
spasms as every nerve in her body screamed out in ecstasy. She just lay 
there for a moment to catch her breath, unable to speak. As she caught 
her breath she sat up slightly to say something but at that exact moment 
the whole room flashed black for a moment. Even after the shade moved 
over the room and the lights became visible there still seemed to be a 
lingering shadow in the room. They both looked over to their left, 
towards the door. Standing there in the middle of the room was a dark 
menacing figure. Completely black except for piercing red eyes it stood 
there looking at them.

      &quot;Hahaha,&quot; it laughed. &quot;Lesbierin,&quot; it said calmly.

      &quot;Leave us alone... Please leave us father,&quot; pleaded Mia, still out 
of breath. &quot;Why do you persist on haunting me like this, I haven&#39;t and 
now can&#39;t do anything to you.&quot;

      The figure instantly covered the distance between it and the bed, 
grabbing Arine around the mouth with an inescapable grip.

      &quot;No stop, I love her! I love her you monster!&quot; Mia shouted at the 
figure, hearing Arine scream into her mouth as her air was cut off. Mia 
struggled to pull the demon off of her love but wasn&#39;t strong enough. 
Finally out of options, she bit the monster on its arm. It screamed in 
pain and backed away, disappearing in a cloud of dark smoke. The cloud 
just floated there for a second then rushed at them.

&quot;No Arine!&quot; Mia shouted as she sat up in bed in a cold sweat. It felt so 
real. She could still taste the flesh in her mouth from when she bit 
him, and the sense of pleasure and relaxation. &#39;What is going on?&#39; She 
thought. She looked over to where Arine was supposed to be but saw 
nothing in the empty bed. 

&quot;Arine, Arine, where you?&quot; she called quietly. 

      After waiting for an answer that never came Mia started to worry. 
She got out of bed, straightening her hair out of her eyes. She slowly 
walked towards the door. On her way to the door something caught her eye 
out the window. It was Arine standing on the shore not but 50 yards from 
the house. Wondering what Arine was doing, she went downstairs and out 
the door, careful not to make any noise.

      She walked up besides Arine and suddenly knew why she was just 
standing there on a beach. The ocean was so calm but still was lively 
enough to create the sound of waves turning over as they collided with 
the soft white sand. A wave came up and rushed over Mia&#39;s feet up to her 
ankles. The water was perfectly warm. She wiggled her feet back and 
fourth to bury them in the sand farther. She looked at Arine, who was 
staring intently out to sea. The depth of the look on her face seemed to 
emanate a feeling of power and concentration. The stare was so intense 
that Mia even wondered if Arine knew she was standing there next to her.

      For over an hour Arine just stood there not making a sound and as 
far as Mia could tell not breathing. Meanwhile Mia&#39;s legs had begun to 
ache from standing so still for so long. Without any notion Arine turned 
and walked away towards the house. Mia followed about five feet behind 
her. She thought about the dream and almost said something about it 
right then, but something stopped her. There was a barrier around Arine 
tonight, she wasn&#39;t sure but for some reason she had to drop her gaze 
from the Angel in front of her. Something about Arine seemed foreboding; 
it sent chills down Mia&#39;s spine.

      Arine just laid down in bed and rolled over towards the wall to 
give Mia room to lay down as well. Mia put her arm over Arine, resting 
her hand on her stomach. The Angel gave no reaction at all, for she was 
already asleep. Mia snuggled up behind her. Mia had an odd feeling in 
her gut; it told her Arine was quite herself right now. It was strange; 
the feeling seemed to radiate from Arine. 

      Arine woke up that morning, the sun shining right in her face. 
&#145;Uhg, I&#39;ve gotta move this bed.&#39; She rolled over and saw Mia, pressed up 
against her. &#145;I can&#39;t let her sleep in late today like she usually 
does.&#39; Arine got a mischievous idea on how to wake Mia. She bent over 
and kissed Mia, keeping her from getting air because she always breathed 
out her mouth. Mia awoke and pushed Arine away.

&quot;What was that for?!&quot;

&quot;You mean you don&#39;t want me to kiss you?&quot; Said Arine slyly.

&quot;No... You can kiss me, but why did you wake me up so early?&quot;

&quot;Would you like to know?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and quit answering me with more questions. Do you ever give anyone 
a straight yes or no?&quot;

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Asked Arine.

&quot;Damn it. See there you go again,&quot; said Mia suppressing a laugh at Arine 
smart remark.

&quot;Fine, we are going to the beach this morning. If we go now it won&#39;t be 
to hot.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of which, why where you on the beach last night?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that was...&quot; Arine trailed off.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Never mind that, I&#39;ll explain it some other time.&quot;

      Arine and Mia proceeded to get dress. Mia chose a lightly made 
brown knee length shirt and a sleeveless purple tank top that Arine had 
bought her. Arine wore a cream white short sleeve v-cut shirt and a 
light skirt like Mia&#39;s but a little longer more down towards her lower 
calf. As soon as they got the beach Mia ran straight into the water. She 
continued out until the water reached her waist.

&quot;Hurry up Arine, the water is just warm enough,&quot; she yelled back toward 
the shore.

&quot;You do know that every twentieth or so wave is higher than the rest?&quot;

&quot;What about it?&quot;

      Arine simply pointed behind Mia. Mia turned around just in time to 
see a wave at shoulder height break on her. &quot;Aaaa-guh&quot; Mia yelled as 
some of the salty water splashed up into her mouth.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Mia yelled, turning around to see Arine bent over laughing. 
&quot;Humor, Hardy har har,&quot; she shot back at Arine who was holding her 
stomach from laughing so hard.

&quot;Well then, I suppose I should continue where the wave finished,&quot; said 
Arine whispering something under her breath. Behind Mia an orb of water 
floated out of the water and positioned it&#39;s self above her. It hovered 
there for a second the fell on her head, soaking her the rest of the 
way.

&quot;Aha ha ha ha,&quot; Arine cracked up laughing so hard she fell over into the 
sand.

&quot;Oh no, that&#39;s the last straw. You&#39;re not getting out of this one.&quot; Mia 
charged through the water at an incredible speed for being up to her 
waist in water. She jumped on Arine trying to wrestle her to the ground. 
The Angel wasn&#39;t going out without a fight this time however. They 
traded top/bottom positions several times but in the end Mia&#39;s demonic 
strength wouldn&#39;t be denied. She ended up on top of Arine with her hand 
on Arine&#39;s wrists, her legs on the outside of Arine&#39;s. They both where 
laughing.

&quot;Ha ha, dummkopf,&quot; said Arine.

      Soon Mia stopped laughing, and Arine stopped shortly afterwards. 
Something connected between them, their eyes drawn together. Mia&#39;s lips 
moved as if to say something.

      &quot;Kuss mich (kiss me),&quot; Arine said.

      Mia knew what it meant, Arine had said it before, and told her 
what it meant. She slowly bent over and their lips met. Mia caressed 
Arine&#39;s lips with her tongue. Arine responded with a soft moan. Their 
tongue&#39;s met and danced around with each other for what seemed like 
minutes to the girls. They had to break the kiss reluctantly for breath. 
Mia looked back at Arine, and then kissed her again. Mia let go of 
Arine&#39;s wrists and moved her hands down to her hips. As the kiss went on 
her hands crept up. Mia lifted up her body some to give her hands some 
room. He cupped Arine&#39;s breasts, softly caressing them with the tips of 
her fingers. Once again the kiss broke, but Mia&#39;s hands didn&#39;t leave 
their new favorite spot.

&quot;I love you,&quot; said Mia.

&quot;I love you too, dummkopf,&quot; replied Arine.

      Mia continued to massage and play with Arine&#39;s breasts, enjoying 
the soft sounds of pleasure coming from the Angels mouth. She just 
couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Mia got up and grabbed Arine&#39;s hand, pulling 
her up.

&quot;I want to talk to you about something inside,&quot; declared Mia, without 
her usual playful attitude in her voice. Arine didn&#39;t question Mia but 
still lead the way into the house. They walked in, Mia locking the door 
behind them.

&quot;Let&#39;s go upstairs,&quot; Mia commanded.   

      Once upstairs they went into the bedroom and sat in the bed. Mia 
had a nerves look on her face, so she grabbed and held Arine&#39;s hand. 
&#145;I&#39;m going to tell her about my dream, no matter the consequences. I 
think I&#39;ll leave out my father though,&#39; Mia thought to herself, to build 
up courage.

&quot;Arine, I had a dream last night I need to tell you about.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;The dream is about us together.&quot;

&quot;Together?&quot; Asked Arine.

&quot;We make love to each other. I don&#39;t know but it just didn&#39;t feel like a 
dream to me,&quot; answered Mia.

&quot;Damn it, I still can&#39;t control it. I&#39;m worthless,&quot; said Arine.

&quot;Control what, what are you talking about?&quot; Questioned Mia.

&quot;My telepathy, Angels have some psychic powers. We can communicate raw 
thought or feelings to each other, I never have been able to control 
mine like I should.&quot;

&quot;So what you&#39;re saying is that what I dreamt of was really your 
thoughts?&quot;

&quot;In a way. Everyone can perceive thoughts differently. My dream may not 
have been quite as intimate, but it was about my love for you.&quot;

&quot;Ok now your holding back. What do you mean by &quot;may not have been as 
intimate&quot;, you know your own thoughts. Come one now, tell the truth 
please. I need to know how you feel about me, but so you know, I liked 
the dream... very much.&quot;

&quot;The dream was... intimate,&quot; was all Arine said blushing.

&quot;And, how did you feel about it, I must know before I go crazy.&quot;

&quot;I feel the same way as you do,&quot; said Arine, blushing even stronger.

&quot;I thought so,&quot; Mia said, scooting closer to Arine. &quot;I... I want it to 
come true, so bad.&quot; This time it was Mia&#39;s turn to blush.

&quot;Mia, Ich will du.&quot; Arine half moaned as Mia brought her hand back up to 
Arine&#39;s chest.

&quot;Oh by the way Arine, I have no intention of being the subordinate one,&quot; 
said Mia in her familiar playful tone. 

Lemon!!!!!!!!! 

      Mia slipped her hands up under Arine&#39;s shirt, pulling it up over 
her breasts. She rubbed Arine&#39;s flesh softly but with enough pressure to 
cause Arine to moan. &#145;Not going to be the subordinate one huh, not if I 
have anything to say about it&#39; thought Arine. She pushed Mia off and 
quickly got on top of her. Arine kissed Mia as deeply as Mia had on the 
beach. Arine grabbed the back of Mia shirt and pulled it up. They broke 
the kiss as Arine pulled Mia&#39;s shirt above her head. Before Arine could 
go back down Mia put her hands on Arine shoulders, stopping her.

      Mia took this chance to quickly remove Arine&#39;s shirt the rest of 
the way. Arine bent back down to kiss Mia. As she did, Mia wrapped her 
arms around Arine, pulling her closer, their breasts pushing into each 
other.

&quot;Ich liebe dich, dummkopf,&quot; Arine said in a loving tone as she reached 
down to undo the tie that held Mia&#39;s skirt on. Mia showed just as much 
initiative by reaching for the tie on Arine&#39;s skirt. In a moment both 
girls where wearing only their panties. Arine pushed her leg up against 
Mia&#39;s sensitive areas, bringing soft moans from Mia. Mia reached down 
with her right hand and grabbed the back of Arine&#39;s leg, pulling it 
harder into her. Arine slowly moved her leg up and down, sliding it 
along Mia&#39;s love. Mia lost her breath.

      Mia decided she wouldn&#39;t have all the fun. She reached down and 
slipped her hand under Arine&#39;s panties, caressing the area around 
Arine&#39;s sex. Arine froze up with the stimulation Mia was causing.

&quot;I love you Arine, I want to make sure you know that&quot; Mia said. 

&quot;I know, and I love you to, very much Mia,&quot; was Arine&#39;s reply.

      Mia slipped two of her fingers in to Arine&#39;s hot sex, causing 
Arine to moan loudly. Arine continued the movement on Mia with her leg 
as Mia used her fingers. Mia reached around Arine&#39;s back with her free 
hand and pulled Arine closer to her. Arine was in so much ecstasy she 
could no longer continue rubbing Mia with her leg. Arine hit orgasm, her 
body quivering in ecstasy. After her orgasm was over she went limp of 
several seconds.

      Arine slowly recovered, but as she did she moved her hand between 
Mia&#39;s legs. She began to slowly rub Mia&#39;s clit between her index finger 
and thumb. Mia lost all feeling in her body due to the pleasure that 
Arine was bringing to her, the only thing that mattered to her now was 
this beautiful girl next to her, and the pleasure she was bringing to 
her. The dreams second part about her father was the farthest thing from 
her mind right now. Arine just wouldn&#39;t slow down. Mia could feel an 
orgasm building deep inside her. She held onto this feeling of pure 
bliss as long as she possibly could, but Arine wouldn&#39;t be denied giving 
her lover the same pleasure she had given her. Mia orgasmed with Arine 
kissing her, her moans muffled by Arine&#39;s lips. Her spasms where more 
controlled than Arine&#39;s but the pleasure the orgasm was just as great. 
Mia sighed and put her arms around her lover.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I want to go back home Arine.&quot;

&quot;I know, my parents will understand the way we both feel for eachother,&quot; 
said Arine. Both girls fell asleep not long after that. While in each 
others arms, neither held a care in the world.
Authors notes

      Due to some confusion with some earlier German translations, I&#39;ll 
try to confront them now. &quot;Sie&quot; is a common word that normally means 
she. I found a German grammer book on the Internet and it states that 
&quot;Sie&quot;, when capitalized, can also be used as a formal form of you, much 
like the -dono (comes from the word tono which means Lord) honorific 
used in Japanese or a Mr./Mrs. title in English. Please don&#39;t email me 
about bad translations, if their wrong, chances are I know it. Also Feur 
frei had a typo and is missing an &quot;e&quot; if I remember. It should be Feuer 
Frei. As for &quot;Dummkopf&quot;, that is a multipurpose word that can mean 
anything as light as dummy or idiot, to something as insulting as 
jackass. In this case it is used as more of the first.

      Btw thank you for helping me with the translations. (You know who 
you are). They shouldn&#39;t be wrong anymore, well, unless if skip a letter 
here and there. My Word Processors spell check isn&#39;t configured for 
German so if I skip a letter than it doesn&#39;t help any. As for Arine&#39;s 
mindless staring at the ocean, I was personifying myself. I was in 
Mexico during the last week of October of 06. After dinner there I would 
go out to the beach while it was dark and just stare out into the 
distance for what if found out to be almost an hour every night. The 
time I spent there was used deep thinking about things in general, or 
just enjoying the ocean. You have to be there to understand the beauty 
of the area, aside from it being about one hundred and f@%ken ten 
degrees outside.  

Here I am listening to Korn/Pink Floyd and writing shoujo-ai/yuri fan 
fiction. *Sighs* welcome to my world.  </pre>
