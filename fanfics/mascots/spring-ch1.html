<h1>Spring (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/toweringman.html">Toweringman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The ocean shimmered.

Stopping to loosen a pebble from between her foot and sandal, Arine 
looked across the blue vastness and smiled. The sea was one thing that 
gave her only happy memories. Soon the spring would have warmed the 
waters enough for her to go swimming. She grinned. Truth be told, it was 
still really cold, but that hadn&#39;t stopped her before. Floating in the 
gentle waves, swimming to the tiny scattered isles that would be warm 
from bathing in the sun, she could forget any worldly problems.

The paved road to the town would have avoided the pebbles and the 
occasional tangly seaweed, but now that the strong winter winds had 
blown away, she could find no reason to use the road. Every boulder and 
crevice in the sandstone cliffs looked so familiar even after nearly 
half a year. The drifts of seashells always moved, though, and every now 
and then she would stray to pick up a small spiral shell. She liked the 
purple ones the most, maybe because there were so few of them.

Rounding a sheer cliff, the town of Wynmere came to view. It looked as 
cozy from the coast as from the road. The whitewashed buildings with 
dark wooden paneling, few more than two stories high, gathered around 
the single church. Farmhouses and pastures dotted the rolling hills 
around the town. It was the small but thriving heart of the surrounding 
countryside, its market square bustling every day save sundays. Arine 
looked forward to picking her favourite foodstuffs from the magnificent 
array of colourful vegetables, fresh herbs and the countless different 
grains. She loved cooking almost as much as the sea, if you could 
compare the two. The villagers were familiar with her dislike for meat, 
and accepted her choice. Old Mrs. Fern always had the prettiest 
vegetables reserved for her in a separate basket, no matter how many 
times Arine told her that all of her vegetables were delicious. Today, 
she just couldn&#39;t stop smiling.

             .......

Arine weaved through the bustling market. The sun beat on her back, and 
her bag already weighed more than she had expected. It was simply 
impossible to choose what not to buy. Fresh leeks stuck out of the bag, 
and her small backpack bulged from the weight of potatoes. She would 
have a hard time deciding whether to take the road back to her house. 
Three miles in the soft sand of the shore with the weight she was 
carrying was not impossible, but she had work to do tonight. Still, she 
grinned and exclaimed at the colours and smells of the market, and 
refused to consider that she might already have all she needed. Walking 
in the throng, she exchanged greetings with other smiling people. 
Everybody seemed to be in a jolly mood on this the sunny spring day. She 
noticed some folks who had meen all but pent up at their farms all 
winter, and made it a point to chat with all of them. Most of the 
conversations started with the weather, and many were marked with a roar 
of laughter at a well-placed joke. After the long gloomy winter it was 
as if everyone had shaken off the their usual reservations. She too, she 
noticed; she usually didn&#39;t enjoy crowds all that much, but today 
everybody just felt like a long-lost friend.

Looking at the big clock in the front wall of the town hall, Arine 
smiled ruefully and started towards the side of the square. It was time 
to get back to her house, and it would have to be the road. But this was 
such a fine day that her mood wouldn&#39;t be brought down by anything. The 
sun was still high, too. In the evening she could walk to the shore to 
watch the sunset and listen to the sea birds. As she neared the edge of 
the square the throng began to open, and she adjusted the shoulder strap 
of her backpack as she walked past the clothes stalls. Glancing up to 
see that she wasn&#39;t walking into anybody, her eyes met a reddish brown 
skirt embroidered with white and purple beads, and a white flowing 
shirt. Dark chestnut hair curled over the shoulders of the girl who was 
chatting with a stall keeper. Even without the delicately pointed ears 
of the A&eacute;ann, she would have stood out in her beautiful clothing. Most 
people here liked simple linen and cotton in browns and grays, sometimes 
plain blue; only on festival days would they dress in bright colours. 
A&eacute;ann were not an uncommon sight here, since many families lived nearby, 
but Arine slowed her step to get a closer look at the girl who had her 
back turned towards her. She had chatted with the A&eacute;ann a few times, and 
it was always memorable; she had felt like she gained a small piece of 
wisdom.

Moving a bit closer to the stall, Arine tried to catch a glimpse of the 
girl&#39;s face, but she was examining a piece of lace and her dark hair 
obscured her features. Arine thought about walking by; it was not her 
habit to introduce herself to every new person she saw. Her good mood 
encouraged her to walk to the stall after all. Since the girl had caught 
her interest, she might as well say hello to her. Arine set her bag on 
the ground in front of the stall and greeted the stallkeeper, then 
looked at the slightly shorter girl beside her. The dark-haired girl 
noticed her and turned to her, the lace still in her hands. Her eyes 
were large and dark, and she wore a small smile. Under those deep eyes 
Arine suddenly forgot what she had meant to say.

&quot;Hi&quot;, the girl said, smiling.

&quot;Hi&quot;, Arine managed. She should say something, but with the girl looking 
straight into her eyes she couldn&#39;t seem to think straight. &quot;Uh, I 
haven&#39;t seen you here before.&quot; Stupid! That wasn&#39;t too polite.

&quot;Oh, I just moved here this spring. Do you live here, too?&quot;, the girl 
said with a kind smile. Whether or not she noticed Arine&#39;s stammering, 
and Arine was sure she had, she didn&#39;t look at all amused or offended.

&quot;Yes, my house is a few miles from here, on the shore. Um, my name is 
Arine. Nice to meet you.&quot; Arine breathed in with relief. There was no 
reason to feel awkward.

&quot;I&#39;m Mia. It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.&quot; Mia smiled and turned to the 
stall to pick up another piece of lace, which she wrapped around her 
neck. &quot;Do you think this one would suit me better?&quot;

Arine was taken by surprise. However much reservations she and the 
townspeople had shed on this spring day, this girl hit her with an 
openness that she hadn&#39;t prepared for. Arine looked at the dark lace 
around Mia&#39;s neck, and down at her shirt. The sleeveless white shirt 
bared the girl&#39;s shoulders and showed the top of her chest, although her 
breasts were well covered. She raised her eyes back to Mia&#39;s face. Mia 
was looking into her eyes expectantly, and Arine lowered her gaze back 
to the lace around Mia&#39;s neck, her face colouring slightly. She suddenly 
realized she might have offended the girl by studying her so openly. The 
truth was, she was beautiful. Beyond beautiful, and the lace around her 
slim neck made Arine blush.

&quot;I didn&#39;t intend it for everyday clothing, mind&quot;, Mia said, laughing. 
&quot;Please, say your honest opinion. If it&#39;s too gaudy I&#39;ll pass on it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful&quot;, Arine said, raising her eyes to Mia&#39;s and trying to 
fight the blush. It was just that people usually wore that kind of 
clothing only on special occasions, like weddings and dances. She 
couldn&#39;t imagine herself in such beautiful and revealing clothes even 
for a dance, but Mia made them look natural and comfortable. That&#39;s what 
she had always liked in the A&eacute;ann. They were at ease with themselves, 
something that she herself felt only on especially good days like today.

&quot;Really? Thank you! I think I&#39;ll take it, then&quot;, Mia said happily, 
turning to hand over the coins to the stallkeeper with a thank you. 
&quot;I&#39;ve only been here a few times, in this town&quot;, Mia said, turning from 
the stall to face the sunlight. &quot;Today, my uncle had business in 
Thierva, so I asked if I could ride the cart with him here. I like the 
market, and the people.&quot;

&quot;I come here a couple of times a week to buy food. It&#39;s a really nice 
walk from my house along the shore&quot;, Arine said, looking at Mia, who had 
taken a necklace from her pocket and was fitting the clasp behind her 
neck. Small thin bracelets in browns and reds clinked merrily on her 
wrists.

&quot;Oh! I love the sea&quot;, Mia exclaimed. &quot;I came from the inland, so this 
spring was the first time I&#39;ve seen it. It&#39;s too long a distance for me 
to walk from Falow, where my family lives. Otherwise I&#39;d love to walk 
here along the shore. Now I have to wait for my uncle to come back from 
Thierva. It might be night before he comes, but I&#39;ll just have to wait 
since I wanted to come&quot;, Mia said, smiling sweetly.

&quot;That&#39;s too bad.&quot; Arine looked at Mia, who had her eyes closed and her 
face turned to the sunlight. She liked this girl already and didn&#39;t want 
to part yet. She wondered if Mia would like to be her friend. The few 
good friends she had all lived far away, so she only met them 
occasionally. Falow was only about seven miles from where she lived, not 
too much to walk. She grimaced. The sun had her socializing much more 
than usual, but Mia was probably kind and happy to everyone. Just 
because they had a nice chat didn&#39;t mean Mia was particularly interested 
in her. She must have made lots of friends since coming to the coast. 
Maybe it was time to leave already. She&#39;d likely see Mia again here 
during the summer.

She should go, but the idea of walking back to her house by herself 
suddenly felt much lonelier than she was used to. All the bustle made 
her want to live in the town, to live with someone. Her chest felt 
tight, and she tried to think how fun it would be to cook tonight.

&quot;Mia&quot;, she started. The name felt strange on her tongue. &quot;My house is 
near the road to Falow.&quot; She swallowed. Why was this so hard? She was 
afraid that Mia would kindly decline. She would still feel awful now 
that she allowed herself the hope of making a friend. &quot;Would you like to 
walk there with me? I-I could make us supper. We can ask somebody to 
tell your uncle?&quot; There. She had said it, so why was her heart pounding? 
She hated herself for being so awkward and pessimistic, and expected Mia 
to tell her she had something else to do.

Mia looked at her with those clear, happy eyes. &quot;Really? I&#39;d love to!&quot;

Arine stared at her. &quot;Great!&quot;, she managed, smiling as well as she 
could. &quot;Do... you have anything else to take care of here?&quot;

&quot;No, I was just spending time. We can go as soon as you like.&quot;

&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll just fill my water bottle from the fountain&quot;, Arine said, 
still finding it impossible to believe she was going to walk her 
favourite route with Mia. She picked up her bag from the ground.

&quot;I&#39;ll carry that&quot;, Mia said, smiling, and extended her hand. Arine 
handed over the bag with a smile.

             .......

The waves lapped peacefully as the girls walked along the shore, talking 
about everything that came to mind. Mia had taken her shoes off and was 
walking barefoot on the sand, turning her head around to study the 
cliffs and the drifts of seashells. &quot;Do you live with your family, 
Arine?&quot;, she asked, twirling the bag she carried.

&quot;No&quot;, Arine answered. &quot;My parents live in the mountains, but they sent 
me to my aunt when I was small, because the mining town isn&#39;t a good 
place for children to grow in. I visit them every now and then.&quot; Arine 
paused, walking in silence for a while. &quot;My aunt passed away a year ago, 
so I live alone in our house now.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s so sad&quot;, Mia said, turning to look at her face. It was the first 
time she had seen Mia show a sad expression. She looked so concerned 
that Arine felt she should comfort her. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. She was really 
old, and I can manage.&quot; She felt tight in the chest again, but she 
smiled reassuringly at Mia.

Mia looked at her for a while. &quot;My real family also lives far away. It 
is our way that young people are sent to live with other families a few 
times, to see the world and to grow.&quot; Her uncle, as she called him, 
would be only a distant relative, or not even a relative at all. Still, 
all the A&eacute;ann Arine had met had been happy and content, so she didn&#39;t 
question the wisdom of their ways.

&quot;What do you do for a living?&quot;, Mia asked.

&quot;I make thread. My aunt taught me how to spin and dye, so I&#39;ve been 
continuing that. But I&#39;ve thought about studying some other profession. 
I don&#39;t know&quot;, Arine said. &quot;I haven&#39;t really decided what I want to do&quot;.

Mia smiled sweetly. &quot;Would you spin me some thread, too? I&#39;d love to 
have a shirt that&#39;s made of your thread.&quot;

Arine looked at her. She was feeling a bit light-headed from happiness. 
Mia liked her, she had to believe that now. Walking with this happy, 
cheerful girl, Arine felt warm and content. &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; She smiled at 
Mia, her eyes stinging a bit. &quot;I&#39;ll show you what kind of threads I can 
make, and you can choose the colours too.&quot;

Mia walked closer to her and took her hand. &quot;Arine...&quot; She glanced at 
Arine, then lowered her eyes. Arine was surprised to see a small blush. 
&quot;I really like you. Would you be my friend?&quot;

Arine missed a step for the wave of happiness that surged in her body. 
She stopped and turned to Mia, who looked at her with those dark clear 
eyes and an uncertain smile. &quot;Yes&quot;, she said, smiling with joy.

             .......

Her house was a medium-sized stone building with a small yard ringed 
with a low stone wall. The path beside the house ran from the road to 
the ocean shore. Low hills and straggly forest protected the house from 
the worst of the winds. Arine dug a key from her backpack and turned it 
in the creaky lock. She opened the oak door and motioned for Mia to step 
in. &quot;Welcome&quot;, she said with a smile.

They had talked about seashells and farming, of swimming and clothes, on 
the way here. Mia had listened eagerly to everything Arine had said, 
asking questions and exclaiming in wonder when Arine told her about the 
small isles that she liked to swim to. And Mia had told her about the 
village where she had lived as a child, about her life in Falow, told 
her about her own favourite places. The more Arine had come to know 
about Mia, the more she liked her, if it was possible to like her more.

Arine took off her sandals and followed Mia in. The dark-haired girl was 
admiring the kitchen. It was Arine&#39;s pride; the large stone oven and the 
assortment of pots and kettles, the blown glasses and pretty porcelain 
dishes. &quot;Are you hungry?&quot;, she asked Mia.

&quot;Yeah&quot;, Mia said with a smile.

&quot;Then let&#39;s get started with supper. Would you help me?&quot;, Arine asked.

&quot;Sure! Just tell me what to do&quot;, Mia said happily.

             .......

Arine opened the lid of the kettle and tasted. It was done. Turning, she 
saw that Mia had made the table and was smiling while setting down the 
water pitcher. Arine took thick cotton gloves and lifted the kettle to 
the table. Sliced bread and salad were already neatly laid out on 
plates, and two other pots sat next to them. The girls sat down on the 
sturdy wooden chairs, facing each other, and Arine took Mia&#39;s plate to 
hand her the sauce. She looked up to see Mia watching her with a happy 
smile. She smiled back as she gave her the plate.

The meal was delicious. The vegetables were fresh and tasty, and the 
company would have made anything taste good. Every now and then Arine 
would look up to Mia, just to see that she really was there at her 
table, eating her food with a delighted expression in her pretty eyes. 
After the meal Arine took her to the workroom to see the threads.

&quot;Wow!&quot; Mia exclaimed, her eyes shining. She went from table to table, 
feeling the different threads in her hands. &quot;What&#39;s your favourite, 
Arine?&quot;, she asked.

Arine smiled in surprise. &quot;My favourite?&quot; She looked around the room, 
then went to pick up a ball of thread. &quot;This is linen and nettle&quot;, she 
said. &quot;I like it a lot.&quot;

Mia stepped in front of her and picked the end of the thread between her 
hands. &quot;This is so soft and beautiful... Would you make me some of this? 
I&#39;ll pay for it, of course&quot;, she said with a smile.

&quot;Sure! What colour do you like?&quot;, Arine asked.

&quot;Red, like wine but a bit more brown&quot;, Mia said, blushing suddenly. &quot;I 
shouldn&#39;t be asking you to make me a special thread...&quot;

&quot;You did, and it&#39;s going to be the most fun piece of work I&#39;ve ever 
done&quot;, Arine said with a smile.

Mia looked her in the eyes. &quot;I&#39;m happy I met you today, Arine&quot;, she 
said, taking Arine&#39;s hand.

Arine smiled back at her, feeling the happiness in her entire body. 
&quot;Would you like to see the garden?&quot;, Arine asked her friend. Her friend, 
Mia. She felt warm beyond the warmth of the room.

&quot;Sure&quot;, Mia replied cheerfully, still holding her hand.

They walked in the garden for a while, Arine showing Mia her herbs and 
flowers. At the sound of a horse&#39;s hooves on the path they turned their 
heads to see a pleasant-looking A&eacute;ann sitting on a cart, waving his hand 
to them. After he stopped the horse near the stone wall, Mia introduced 
Arine to her uncle Canje, and they chatted for a while. Arine remembered 
seeing the fellow a few times before, but she had never really talked 
with him. He was nice and placid, but with a warm sense of humor. Arine 
found herself smiling so much that her cheeks hurt.

Then it was time for the two A&eacute;ann to head home. While Canje got back on 
the cart, Mia took Arine&#39;s hand and looked her in the eyes. &quot;Arine...&quot; 
She put her hands around Arine and pulled her into a hug. &quot;I&#39;m so happy 
I found you&quot;, she murmured. &quot;I want to see you again soon. Can I come 
visit you some day when my uncle comes this way?&quot;

Arine hugged her back. She felt an even deeper happiness from hugging 
the soft, warm girl. Mia&#39;s dark hair pressed against her cheek, and she 
closed her eyes. &quot;I want you to come. Any day is good.&quot;

When the cart had disappeared over the hills, Arine sighed happily and 
went back inside. She sat in the workroom and spun, and prepared some 
dyes for the following day. As the sun set she watched from the window, 
then changed into her nightshift and slipped into bed. Her head was 
filled with Mia. With the kind, dark eyes that shone with delight, with 
the sweet smile and the gentle voice, with all the things they had 
talked about. She couldn&#39;t get any sleep for a long while, but it was 
because of the soft happiness that enveloped her like a blanket.</pre>
