<h1>Togetherness (part 14 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mascots/togetherness-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Amadora knelt beside the body of her great grandmother, the matriarch 
covered in a blanket to keep her physical body warm while her astral 
self was gone. As the dark-haired beauty once more held the mirror in 
her compact up to Gemma&#39;s nose to make sure she was breathing, she 
turned to her younger cousin Gianna, &quot;Is the heat in the apartments up 
all the way?&quot; she demanded.

Gianna nodded, the younger girl was barely thirteen yet looked much 
older. &quot;Yes, the heat is up, and they&#39;re all covered in blankets. Would 
you like me to ask the others to grab the portable heaters?&quot;

Amadora looked thoughtfully at her younger cousin. While the younger 
girl had yet to be trained in any of the ways of the Strega, Amadora was 
already very near the end of her apprenticeship, thus Gianna and the 
others were looking to her to tell them what to do in the absence of the 
adults of the clan.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; she finally answered, &quot;Give them another half an hour, then 
we&#39;ll bring the heaters in.&quot; As Gianna left, Amadora looked once again 
down at her great-grandmother, &quot;Be careful,&quot; she whispered as she 
tenderly ran her fingers through the elder&#39;s thinning white hair.

------

She felt the air rushing by her, blowing her long yellow locks behind 
her. She could hear the cries of the druid Nicholas MacAulay behind her, 
and a feeling much like being in a descending elevator came over her, 
causing her to gasp sharply.

&quot;M... Momma De Luca,&quot; she asked nervously, &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot;

&quot;Shhh,&quot; the matriarch said soothingly as she held the young woman 
closer, &quot;Everything&#39;s okay, we&#39;re just descending,&quot; she explained. As 
the bound Yamanba behind them let out a series of loud curses in 
Japanese, she leaned a bit closer to the reporter&#39;s ear, &quot;How are you 
feeling?&quot;

&quot;The nausea&#39;s gone,&quot; Arine answered, &quot;And I no longer feel quite so 
weak, but I still can&#39;t see anything. Oh, and my head is killing me.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t doubt it,&quot; the Strega said sympathetically, &quot;You took quite a 
hit or two to the face it seems. Hold on.&quot;

Suddenly Arine felt herself falling at a much faster and steeper rate 
than she had been a few moments earlier. The effect was something akin 
to riding a roller coaster blindfolded. There was a quick downward 
movement, followed by a sharp left, then another downward movement 
before she could feel some sort of leveling off. As the druid continued 
his groans of pain behind her Arine heard what sounded like a door being 
flung open, followed strangely by angry growling. Afraid, she was about 
to ask Momma De Luca what was going on, when she realized they&#39;d 
stopped.

Suddenly, she felt a pair of arms wrapped around her neck in a fierce 
hug.

------

The Shea elf, surrounded by several of the wolves of the pack, waited 
anxiously for word on the condition of the owl Althor and the fairy 
&#39;Athas. In a corner of the room, O&#39;Brian crouched in fear as three of 
the wolves continued to bark out their threats at him.

As she continued to rub her sore side where Donovan had hit her with his 
shillelagh, the door to her house opened on its own. Two ghostly Strega 
flying nude upon their broomsticks swept into the room, followed closely 
by Momma De Luca and her beloved. As the rest of the Strega and their 
cargo enter the cottage, the door closed and locked itself.

Mia stood and rushed over to her, noting the swollen left eye as she did 
so. She began to weep as she hugged her partner close, closing her eyes 
as she buried her face in her shoulder. She felt Arine reach up 
tentatively, touching the side of her face.

&quot;M... Mia,&quot; the blonde asked, &quot;Mia, is it you?&quot;

The elf pulled back a bit to look at her love, &quot;Arine, what&#39;s wrong? 
Can&#39;t you see me?&quot;

Arine began to shake her head, &quot;No,&quot; she answered softly, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Wait,&quot; Gemma said, her voice authoritative as she strode forward. As 
the elf continued to hold her tenderly Arine felt Momma De Luca&#39;s cold 
astral hand come to rest upon her forehead, &quot;Diana, bella Diana!&quot; she 
called out, &quot;Che tanto bella e, buona siei, tu mi voglia...&quot;

As the Strega continued chanting out Italian, Arine&#39;s hair felt like it 
was standing on end and spots of white and red dots began to dance 
before her eyes. Soon, the dots and the darkness disappeared, and she 
saw the familiar pointed ears and earthy beauty of the woman holding 
her. &quot;Mia,&quot; she whispered as she leaned forward, their foreheads 
touching as the blonde returned the elf&#39;s embrace.

As the two lovers were reunited, one of the Strega walked over to the 
hearth carrying Maire gingerly in her hands. A wolf quickly strode 
towards the pair, his ears picking up as he noticed the injured pooka&#39;s 
leg. &quot;What happened?&quot; he asked.

&quot;That one there,&quot; she explained, pointing at the bound Yamanba with her 
elbow, &quot;She&#39;s responsible for hurting the fata.&quot;

The wolf allowed an angry snarl to escape him as he looked over to the 
Japanese witch. He then looked back to the Strega and the injured pooka.

&quot;Take her into the library,&quot; the wolf ordered, &quot;Armano is already in 
there tending to two others.&quot;

&quot;Two others?&quot; Maire asked, forgetting for the moment about her own pain 
as she focused on who else may have been hurt.

&quot;Althor and Athas,&quot; the wolf answered, &quot;The Irishman over there did it,&quot; 
he said, pointing with his nose to Donovan O&#39;Brian.

&quot;Athas and Althor, no!&quot; the pooka cried out.

&quot;Come,&quot; the Strega carrying the small shape shifter said as she carried 
her quickly into the library.

Momma De Luca meanwhile had her attention focused on the two weeping 
women holding onto one another on the floor. She smiled happily at 
seeing the two lovers reunited.

Her smile quickly faded however when she turned to face the three 
captives.

&quot;Well,&quot; she began as she placed her hands on her hips and faced O&#39;Brian, 
the druid and the Yamanba, &quot;What do you three scoundrels have to say for 
yourself?&quot; Focusing her attention on the Irishman she narrowed her eyes 
angrily as she came nearer, &quot;Speak,&quot; she ordered, &quot;Before I give you the 
evil eye!&quot;

Donovan, already scared out of his wits by talking wolves, was 
dumbstruck at the ghostly form of the naked woman angrily facing him. 
&quot;Mary, mother of God...&quot; he whispered as he sank to his knees.

Turning away from the now pathetic O&#39;Brian, she now turned her furious 
gaze upon the young man lying on the ground in a fetal position, teeth 
clenched in pain as he held his groin. &quot;And you,&quot; she scolded, &quot;A druid, 
one of the priesthood of the old ways, betraying an elf! And for what? 
How much money did it cost the Irishman to get you to turn traitor to 
the fey folk whom the druids always walked with and protected? You are 
below contempt,&quot; she spat out venomously. Nicholas MacAulay was in too 
much pain to answer; he could only groan as he lay before Mamma De 
Luca&#39;s angry stare.

Finally, she turned her attention to Yumiko the Yamanba, still bound by 
the cursed lemon peels. &quot;And you,&quot; she began, only to be interrupted by 
the Japanese witch herself.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t bother,&quot; she said sadly &quot;I already know what you are 
going to say. Unbind me.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Gemma asked incredulously, &quot;Do you take us for fools?&quot;

The Yamanba shook her head dejectedly as she met the matriarch&#39;s gaze, 
&quot;You&#39;ve won,&quot; she answered, &quot;I&#39;ve been defeated. Release me, I&#39;m no 
longer a threat to you or them,&quot; she said, motioning with her head 
towards the elf and the reporter still holding one another on the floor.

Gemma raised her eyebrow at that. Her ghostly form walked up to the 
Japanese witch and she looked deep and intently into her bloodshot eyes. 
Finally, after close to a minute and a half, she broke the silence. &quot;I 
sense no deception,&quot; she said in a low tone. &quot;Very well, but try 
anything and you&#39;ll never leave the elf&#39;s cottage.&quot;

The Yamanba nodded, and the peels fell loose from her. She slowly went 
over to the two women on the floor. As Arine and Mia looked on, the 
witch hung her head low and frowned. &quot;It was the two of you who were the 
targets and intended victims of all this,&quot; she began reluctantly, &quot;And 
it was the two of you, along with your friends and allies, who have put 
me to shame. I have lost face, and have but one option. Each of you may 
make one wish, within reason,&quot; she quickly added, emphasizing the last 
two words, &quot;And I must grant them.&quot;

Mia quickly looked from the witch to her love and back, &quot;Really?&quot; she 
asked suspiciously, &quot;This isn&#39;t some sort of a trick?&quot;

The Yamanba shook her head, &quot;No, I swear,&quot; she answered, adding &quot;I have 
no choice. It is a matter of honor.&quot;

The elf pulled back from Arine and stood up. Walking over to O&#39;Brian, 
she eyed the cruel man as she made sure to keep the wolves between her 
and him. &quot;If I call off the wolves,&quot; she began, &quot;And allowed you free 
passage out of here, would you be willing to let me and my beloved live 
in peace?&quot;

Donovan looked from the elf down to the wolves showing their teeth 
around him, &quot;O... Of course,&quot; he answered nervously as he attempted to 
smile, &quot;I... I&#39;ve learned me lesson, an&#39; I...&quot;

&quot;Bugiardo!&quot; one of the wolves snarled out, &quot;Your lying, you reek of 
falsehood.&quot;

&quot;Old woman,&quot; Mia said as she turned to face the Yamanba, &quot;I don&#39;t know 
who you are, or how you became involved with this Irish bastard, but if 
you truly have the power to grant me a wish, erase his memories so that 
he remembers nothing of Shea elves or stupid blood feuds.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Donovan asked in shock.

&quot;That I can do,&quot; the Japanese witch answered. Turning away from the elf, 
she now faced the frightened Irishman.

&quot;No!&quot; O&#39;Brian cried out. Turning angrily to Mia, he forgot himself in 
his anger. &quot;Slut!&quot; he yelled, &quot;Elfin whore! I&#39;ll get you for this, 
I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;No, you won&#39;t,&quot; the Yamanba said as she raised a bony hand, &quot;Wasueru!&quot;

Donovan O&#39;Brian opened his mouth to say something, when suddenly his 
face took on a vacant expression. His eyes rolled backwards and he 
collapsed to the floor. The witch turned from the Irishman to Mia.

&quot;His memory loss is complete,&quot; she said. &quot;When he comes to he won&#39;t even 
remember his name.&quot; she then turned to the young blonde with the black 
eye who had observed all in stunned silence, &quot;And you?&quot; she asked, &quot;What 
is your wish?

Arine thought for a moment. She thought of how much her beloved elf had 
come to mean to her in a relatively short period of time, of how tender 
her lover was, how her face lit up when she stroked her behind her cute 
pointy ears.

She then thought of Katie. Of the photo album. Of Mia trying to hide the 
sadness as she smiled bravely for the camera with her arm around her 
elderly love.

&quot;Any wish?&quot; she finally asked.

&quot;within reason, yes.&quot;

Arine turned to face Mia, &quot;I... I wish to be with Mia always,&quot; she 
answered, her eyes meeting those of her beloved elf, &quot;I wish for the 
lifespan of an elf.&quot;

Mia&#39;s eyes widened; she didn&#39;t know what to say. &quot;Arine...&quot;

&quot;Mia, I... I know about Katie,&quot; the blonde began hesitantly, &quot;And I know 
the pain you felt at losing her. And... And I love you and never want 
you to feel that pain again.&quot; As Mia&#39;s eyes began to water up once more, 
Arine turned back to the witch, &quot;Well?&quot; she asked, &quot;Can you do it?&quot;

The Yamanba surprised her and everyone else present when her wrinkled 
and withered old face broke out into a smile. &quot;Very well,&quot; the Yamanba 
said, snapping her fingers as she did so, &quot;Your wish is granted.&quot;

Arine closed her eyes, waiting for some sort of power or something to 
run through her. After a few seconds, she opened her eyes. &quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; 
she asked almost disappointedly. &quot;It&#39;s that easy? No gusts of wind or 
magic potions or loud thunder?&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, that&#39;s it,&quot; the Yamanba confirmed. &quot;You&#39;ll both be reaching 
menopause in about four hundred years. Furthermore,&quot; she added with a 
twinkle in her eyes, &quot;When the time does come, you both shall die of 
natural causes, in each other&#39;s arms.&quot;

The blonde turned to Mia, smiling in spite of her black eye as she once 
more took her elf in her arms. Gemma walked over to the Yamanba, 
crossing her arms as she allowed a smirk. &quot;That was rather generous of 
you,&quot; Momma DeLuca said, &quot;All things considered.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the Japanese Witch said with a shrug, &quot;You know, just between 
us, I never really wanted to be an evil mountain witch in the first 
place. But you know how it is; you fall in with the wrong crowd and...&quot;

&quot;Sure, sure... Say, you ever get up to Little Italy?&quot;

&quot;Well I...&quot; before the Yamanba could answer, a loud knocking could be 
heard at the front door. Arine felt Mia jump and pull away, a look of 
fear once more showing in her beautiful elf&#39;s face.

&quot;Mia,&quot; she asked quickly, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

The elf didn&#39;t answer as the knocking at the door began to grow louder. 
Mamma De Luca held up her right hand, and soon the Strega and wolves of 
the De Luca clan were gathered together in a defensive line between the 
two women and whatever was outside the door. Mia turned and glared 
angrily at the unconscious form of Donovan.

&quot;Fool!&quot; she screamed as the knocking continued to increase in intensity 
and the hinges of the door rattled, &quot;You bloody fool! You kicked over 
the salt, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

With a sinking feeling, Arine remembered the first time she and the elf 
had met, and how she had watched Mia pour salt onto the front porch. She 
also remembered why the elf said she did it.

&quot;To keep away the banshee...&quot; Arine whispered as a blood curdling scream 
was heard coming from outside the front door.

End Notes: I apologize that this story has taken so long to update. A 
lot of stuff has been going on in my private life, and it&#39;s kind of hard 
to write a romantic fantasy when your own life&#39;s down the shitter.

&quot;Diana, bella Diana! Che tanto bella e, buona siei, tu mi voglia...&quot;- 
&quot;Diana, beautiful Diana! Who art indeed as good as beautiful, I do 
implore thee aid me...
