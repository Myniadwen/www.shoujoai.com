<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nwarford.html">Nathan Warford</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mascots/birthrite-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Not having the energy to make it back to her room on floor B1, Mia slept 
in the infirmary that night. Arine had fallen asleep at Mia&#39;s side. It 
seemed that sleep was the only time that the two girlfriends were at 
peace, not having to worry about the troubles of the waking world.

Unlike Mia and Arine, there were two people that could not sleep. Sam 
and Pierre were so baffled by the situation that they could not help but 
play recent events over and over in their minds, trying to find out 
where they went wrong.

&quot;Why?&quot; Sam said softly, his voice rife with grief. &quot;Why did it have to 
happen like this?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand it at all,&quot; said Pierre, his voice just as grave. 
&quot;Arine&#39;s powers should be able to help Mia.&quot;

&quot;She has the Blue Sapphire of Alvara with her. Isn&#39;t it supposed to 
increase her elfin powers?&quot;

&quot;So we thought.&quot;

Just then, a thought came to Sam&#39;s mind. &quot;The Sapphire,&quot; he said to 
himself.

&quot;Sir Samuel?&quot; Pierre asked.

&quot;Arine has the Sapphire,&quot; Sam said, still to himself. &quot;Arine has the 
Sapphire...but not the Ruby.&quot; The young Jewel Summoner excitedly turned 
to Pierre and said, &quot;Lord Pierre. The Lancestor Clan has been led to 
believe that both the Ruby and the Sapphire are required to awaken the 
elf.&quot;

&quot;Arine&#39;s powers have awoken,&quot; said Pierre. &quot;Otherwise she wouldn&#39;t have 
been able to use her powers against us during the raid.&quot;

&quot;No, Lord Pierre. No,&quot; Sam cried. &quot;All that Johan did was teach Arine to 
use the powers that she already had inside her. She had used those 
powers even before she knew about the Legend of Alvara. All that Johan 
did was help Arine to use those powers consciously!&quot;

&quot;What are you saying?&quot;

&quot;During Lord Felix&#39;s inquiry, Arine said that she had her vision when 
she had only the Sapphire in her hands. After that, there wasn&#39;t any 
mention of the Ruby at all! What if Arine&#39;s powers are not fully 
awakened yet?&quot;

Pierre began to understand what Sam was talking about. &quot;Johan said that 
the elf held the key to the future of his clan, that his uncle had some 
kind of disease that only the elf could cure. If Arine&#39;s powers HAD 
awoken, she would have been able to do that for Mia!&quot;

His excitement growing by the second, Sam dashed over to a sleeping 
Arine and shook her by the shoulders. &quot;Arine, wake up,&quot; he gushed, doing 
his best to keep his voice low as not to awaken Mia.

&quot;What is it?&quot; said Arine, tired and now heartbroken again at remembering 
Mia&#39;s prognosis.

&quot;Arine, think back,&quot; said Sam, &quot;When Johan had you hostage, where was 
the Red Ruby of Alvara? Did Johan use the Red Ruby in any way?&quot;

Not even bothering to think about it, Arine simply said, &quot;Not that I can 
remember. What has this got to do with anything?&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s true then!&quot; Sam exclaimed.

&quot;What?&quot; said Arine, very irritated by being awoken from her peaceful 
slumber.

&quot;Your powers WAVEN&#39;T awoken!&quot;

&quot;What the fuck are you talking about?&quot; said Arine, her anger and her 
sadness rising. &quot;You saw what I did to your comrades. Now how could I 
have done that if my powers hadn&#39;t awoken?&quot;

&quot;What powers did Johan teach you how to use?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Leave me alone, Sam!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; said the boy, this time much more assertive. &quot;I can&#39;t leave you 
alone! Not when Mia&#39;s life depends on it!&quot; Mentioning Mia&#39;s name caused 
Arine to stop fuming and pay attention to Sam. &quot;I&#39;m asking you,&quot; Sam 
said. &quot;What powers did Johan teach you to use?&quot;

This time, Arine put thought into her response before answering, 
&quot;Foresight, telekinesis, empathy, and biological vigor.&quot;

&quot;How did Johan teach you to use them?&quot;

&quot;He injected me with a hypnotic drug and told me to think back to times 
when I had...&quot; Arine trailed off as a realization came over her. &quot;I had 
used those powers before,&quot; she realized. &quot;Not intentionally, but I had 
used them!&quot;

&quot;Did he use the Ruby at all?&quot; Sam asked, feeling that he was on the 
verge of a breakthrough.

Arine replied, &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so.&quot;

Sam and Arine looked at Mia&#39;s sleeping form. &quot;Then there may be hope 
after all,&quot; said Sam. Arine looked at Sam, listening intently to Sam&#39;s 
reasoning. Sam explained, &quot;Both the Ruby and the Sapphire are needed to 
awaken the elf&#39;s powers. Johan didn&#39;t use the Ruby. Your powers have not 
completely awoken yet. When they do awaken, you may have enough power to 
save Mia.&quot;

&quot;We need that Ruby,&quot; said Arine, her determination rising.

Sam then said with a pessimistic tone, &quot;That&#39;s the one thing Johan is 
not going to give up willingly.&quot;

&quot;Arine?&quot; a weak voice said.

Arine looked at the direction of the voice. &quot;Mia,&quot; said Arine, seeing 
that her girlfriend had awoken.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; asked the brunette.

&quot;We think there may still be a way to save you, Mia,&quot; said Sam.

&quot;But we need the Ruby to do it,&quot; Arine added.

&quot;How are you going to get the Ruby?&quot; Mia asked.

&quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to figure out right now,&quot; said the blonde, 
conviction overflowing in her voice. Arine and Sam walked over to 
Pierre. &quot;We need to convene,&quot; said Arine.

Also knowing that convening was the right course of action, Pierre said, 
&quot;I&#39;ll alert the Clan Leaders.&quot; Yvette was sitting in Pierre&#39;s lap while 
she slept, so Pierre needed to awaken Yvette so that he would be able to 
stand up. &quot;Yvette?&quot; he said.

&quot;Pierre?&quot; asked the woman, the man&#39;s voice waking her.

&quot;I have to meet with the other Clan Members,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;We have to 
discuss retrieving the Ruby from Johan.&quot; Yvette stood up, allowing 
Pierre to stand as well.

As Pierre and Arine were beginning to leave, Sam said to them, &quot;If you 
don&#39;t mind, I think I&#39;d like to sit this one out.&quot;

&quot;Sir Samuel?&quot; Pierre asked, surprised by Sam&#39;s wish.

&quot;If you&#39;re going after Johan,&quot; said the boy, &quot;there&#39;s not much that I 
can do. Besides, I&#39;d like to watch over Mia for a while, if that&#39;s okay 
with the Clan Leaders, that is.&quot;

Pierre thought for a moment. Eventually, he responded, &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to 
let them know.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Sam, smiling.

Arine went to Mia one last time to say, &quot;I have to go now, Mia.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; the brunette replied.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Arine assured. &quot;We&#39;ll get through this somehow.&quot; After 
giving her beloved one kiss before leaving, the blonde said, &quot;I&#39;ll be 
back soon.&quot; With that, Pierre and Arine exited the infirmary to gather 
the rest of the Jewel Summoners.

----------

Although he had fully recovered from his injuries, Johan was very 
agitated. To distract himself from his own confusion, the Finn had gone 
to a bare room at the hideout to practice his martial arts and to train 
his newfound elfin powers. The Red Ruby of Alvara was sitting on a 
plain, wooden table at one side of the room. While practicing his 
martial arts, Johan jumped to one of the walls. Now with the heightened 
senses of an elf, even though Johan spent only a fraction of a second on 
the wall, it felt more to him like several seconds. Johan jumped off of 
the wall to the ceiling and then jumped from the ceiling back to the 
ground. Looking at the table, he waved his hand just a little bit, his 
new telekinetic powers causing the table to shake. Johan clenched his 
fist and the table simply shattered into splinters. He raised his hands 
above his head and the room started shaking. After shaking the room for 
a moment, Johan simply looked at his hands, amazed by the power that he 
had gained.

&quot;Sir Johan?&quot; said a voice behind Johan, where the door to the room was. 
Without even looking behind himself, Johan jumped in the air, did a back 
flip, and landed behind the person who had spoken. Odin jumped back from 
the younger man who had just landed behind him.

Seeing the stun in Odin&#39;s face, Johan started laughing at Odin&#39;s 
surprised expression. After he had stopped laughing, Johan asked 
casually, &quot;Yes, what is it, Lord Odin?&quot;

&quot;Was that you that just made the ground shake?&quot; asked the older man.

Johan put his hands on Odin&#39;s shoulders and said with their faces inches 
apart, &quot;And I didn&#39;t even use the Ruby.&quot; Johan laughed at his new elfin 
powers, and then released his superior and walked over to the shattered 
table.

&quot;Sir Johan,&quot; said Odin as Johan put the Ruby of Alvara in his pocket, 
&quot;with you recovered, I thought we should be getting back to Finland.&quot;

&quot;Back home,&quot; Johan realized.

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Odin. &quot;Lord Blake&#39;s condition has still not improved. But 
now, you can save him. You can save your uncle, Johan!&quot;

&quot;Yes. I can, can&#39;t I?&quot; said Johan, his voice surprisingly 
unenthusiastic.

&quot;Sir Johan,&quot; Odin said, &quot;I may not have the powers that you have 
acquired, but I can still sense that something is troubling you. What is 
it?&quot;

Johan hesitated, thinking about how to tell Odin about what he had 
discovered. Eventually, the tall man answered, &quot;I have a niece.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; a surprised Odin asked.

&quot;You heard me,&quot; Johan said, turning back to the older man. &quot;I have a 
niece.&quot;

&quot;A niece? How?&quot;

&quot;My brother,&quot; Johan replied. &quot;Twenty years ago, he married that Jewel 
Summoner, Erika Dagomar.&quot;

&quot;What of it?&quot; Odin asked, remembering the events that had transpired 20 
years before.

&quot;On the night that Rikhard died,&quot; Johan explained, &quot;he inseminated Erika 
with his seed. A child was conceived and was born on October fourteenth, 
1987. Since then, the child has been found by the Jewel Summoners.&quot; 
Johan then approached Odin and said with a pleading look on his face, 
&quot;Lord Odin, you must help me. What am I to do about Mia Carver?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the problem with her?&quot; asked Odin, a hint of irritation coming 
to his voice.

&quot;She is my kin,&quot; said Johan, &quot;yet she is a Jewel Summoner. Am I to treat 
her as an uncle, or as an enemy?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Sir Johan,&quot; said Odin, &quot;but I can&#39;t answer that question. My 
only obligation is to the Mustanen Clan, not an individual Clan Member 
with the rank of Sir who has a grudge against the people who killed his 
brother. Now come. We must arrange a flight back to Finland.&quot;

As Odin turned to leave, Johan took out the Red Ruby of Alvara and aimed 
it toward Odin. A force pulled Odin backward and spun him around so that 
his face was in front of Johan&#39;s. &quot;Do not dishonor me or Rikhard ever 
again!&quot; Johan barked at Odin.

&quot;My apologies, Johan,&quot; said Odin, cowering in front of the younger man. 
Johan released Odin. Odin then said, more kindly this time, &quot;If there 
were any person that could tell you what to do about Miss Carver, it 
would be Rikhard. I doubt there&#39;s any person alive that could make that 
kind of decision. Now please. Come.&quot;

Odin exited the room. Johan looked at the Ruby in his hand for a moment. 
&quot;Only Rikhard can decide, eh?&quot; he said to himself. Johan followed Odin 
out of the room.

----------

Meanwhile, the Jewel Summoners had convened. Pierre was standing up, 
addressing his comrades. &quot;Arine mentioned nothing about Johan&#39;s use of 
the Red Ruby of Alvara while she was held in Paris. If what the 
Lancestor Clan has discovered is true, and both the Ruby and the 
Sapphire are needed, then the elf&#39;s powers are not fully awakened yet. 
We must devise a strategy for recovering the Ruby of Alvara from Johan 
Mustanen.&quot; Pierre sat down after his speech had ended.

Lady Fredrika spoke, &quot;When we inspected the Array after Johan used it to 
escape, we discovered that the floors and the ceilings were burnt all 
the way to the surface. For the Array to cause such extensive damage to 
the material of this compound, it is likely to assume that Johan 
suffered similar burns as well. Without the healing abilities of the 
elf, I don&#39;t see how he could have survived.&quot;

&quot;Which means that the Ruby must still be nearby,&quot; said Lady Alana. &quot;The 
Lancestors will conduct a sweep of the area, find out Johan&#39;s fate and 
look for anyone who may have taken the Ruby.&quot; It was then that Arine 
stood up. Because Arine had decided to sit by the Lancestor Clan, Alana 
was the one to announce, &quot;Arine Sylven.&quot;

&quot;Jewel Summoners,&quot; Arine addressed everyone in the meeting room, &quot;all I 
can say is...&quot; Arine trailed off, trying to summon the courage to speak 
her wish. She finally finished, &quot;...do everything in your power to help 
Mia. I couldn&#39;t bear to live without her.&quot; Remembering what she had done 
the other night, she continued, &quot;I know I have no right to ask this of 
you, but you must help her. I don&#39;t know why yet, but I do know that 
this is not over. I sense that there is still danger ahead and that we 
must anticipate the unexpected.&quot; Arine sat.

Alana, having seemingly warmed up to the elf, said to her, &quot;I do not 
doubt your powers, Miss Sylven.&quot; She then spoke to her subjects, 
&quot;Members of the Lancestor Clan, tread very carefully; do not let any 
stone go unturned. We must make absolutely certain that Johan is, 
indeed, dead. Because, if he is not, then it is most likely that he, or 
another member of the Mustanen Clan, is in possession of the Ruby.&quot;

----------

Back in the infirmary, while Sam watched over Mia, Yvette had decided to 
observe the Jewel Summoners that were injured in the attack the other 
night.

&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Yvette asked of one of the female Jewel Summoners.

&quot;Antonia Valentino,&quot; said the Italian woman.

&quot;What is the Valentino Clan&#39;s role in the awakening of the elf?&quot; asked 
Yvette.

&quot;We are charged with the duty of misdirection. It is the Valentino 
Clan&#39;s duty to make sure that the general public is not aware of our 
existence.&quot; She then said, somewhat irritated, &quot;And thanks to Pierre 
Doulin, outsiders such as you have discovered us!&quot;

&quot;I promise I won&#39;t tell anyone about the Jewel Summoners or their 
powers,&quot; said the Frenchwoman.

&quot;You had better not,&quot; Antonia spat. &quot;Because if you did, others would 
want to learn the secrets of our powers, and they would only distract us 
from our duties.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; said Yvette. Not wanting to deal with Antonia Valentino 
any longer, Yvette simply continued her observation of the other injured 
Jewel Summoners. As she continued, one Jewel Summoner caught her eye. 
&quot;Sam?&quot; she said, very surprised.

&quot;What is it, Yvette?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;I think there&#39;s something that you should see.&quot;

Sam turned to Mia and said, &quot;Yvette is calling me to one of the injured 
Jewel Summoners.&quot;

&quot;Go check it out,&quot; said Mia. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine here.&quot;

Sam went to the Frenchwoman and asked, &quot;What is it, Yvette?&quot;

Yvette looked as if she had seen a ghost. &quot;Look,&quot; she said, gesturing to 
the unconscious Jewel Summoner lying on the bed before her.

Sam looked at the Jewel Summoner and took on an expression no less 
perplexed than Yvette&#39;s. &quot;What in the world?&quot; he cried.

&quot;Who is she?&quot; Yvette wondered.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; said Sam. &quot;But I sure as hell want to find out!&quot; Sam 
then heard someone racked with violent coughing behind him. Sam rushed 
to Mia and said, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Having seemed to have recovered from her fit, Mia said, &quot;Yes. What is it 
that--?&quot; Just then, Mia was overcome by another fit of coughing.

&quot;You should rest,&quot; Sam said. &quot;Don&#39;t worry yourself about anything. I&#39;m 
going to make sure that you survive somehow.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Mia said. Agreeing with Sam, Mia did as he said closed her eyes.

&quot;She&#39;s asleep,&quot; Sam said as Yvette approached.

&quot;I think we should find out who that Jewel Summoner is,&quot; suggested the 
woman.

&quot;I agree,&quot; said Sam. &quot;I&#39;ll go to the meeting. I&#39;ll ask them. Do you mind 
watching over Mia while I&#39;m gone?&quot;

&quot;Do I have much of a choice?&quot; Yvette asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry that we have to leave you on watch duty, Yvette,&quot; said Sam. 
&quot;But I&#39;m sure Antonia Valentino told you why we have to keep your 
exposure to a minimum.&quot;

&quot;Yes, she told me,&quot; Yvette replied. &quot;I&#39;ll watch Mia,&quot; she conceded.

&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; said Sam. With that, Sam rushed off to inform the 
rest of the Jewel Summoners of the alarming new development.

----------

&quot;If the Ruby is in the hands of the Mustanen Clan,&quot; Lord Giovanni said 
to his subjects, &quot;then we must be very careful when retrieving it. We 
must not arouse suspicion on the part of the Mustanen Clan, or the 
general public.&quot;

&quot;Is there anything more?&quot; Felix asked the Jewel Summoners. When nobody 
responded he said, &quot;Good. The--&quot; As Felix began to speak again, he was 
interrupted by the sound of one of the doors to the meeting room 
opening. He and the other Jewel Summoners turned to see Sam enter the 
room. &quot;Sir Samuel?&quot; he asked.

&quot;There&#39;s an injured Jewel Summoner in the infirmary that we want 
identified,&quot; Sam stated.

----------

Sam led Arine and the four Clan Leaders to the infirmary and presented 
the young woman that was lying unconscious on the bed in front of 
Yvette. &quot;Who is she?&quot; Yvette asked.

Fredrika recognized the brunette lying on the bed. &quot;That&#39;s Madame Lena 
Dagomar,&quot; said the Clan Leader, &quot;my granddaughter.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you think she looks a lot like Mia?&quot; said Sam.

Fredrika gave Sam a surprised expression for a moment. She looked at 
Lena again and then looked over at Mia. &quot;Gud i himmel!&quot; Fredrika cried 
at seeing the striking resemblance.

&quot;Lady Fredrika,&quot; asked Arine. &quot;What does this mean?&quot;

Unable to think of anything better to say,&quot; Fredrika said, &quot;Lena is the 
daughter of my son, Lord Erik Dagomar.&quot;

&quot;Erik Dagomar?&quot; Pierre said.

&quot;I know what you are thinking, Lord Pierre,&quot; Fredrika said. &quot;And you are 
right. Madame Erika Dagomar was Erik&#39;s elder sister. She was my 
daughter.&quot;

Sam looked at Lena again and said, &quot;First, Erika Dagomar has dealings 
with Johan, then twenty years later we find that her brother has a 
daughter that looks like Mia.&quot; He then looked at the Clan Leaders and 
said, &quot;Coincidence?&quot;

&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Arine cried. &quot;This is NOT a coincidence, I&#39;m almost 
sure of it.&quot; turning to Fredrika, Arine asked, &quot;Lady Fredrika, when did 
the Dagomar Clan lose contact with Erika?&quot;

&quot;It was just after the Christmas of 1986,&quot; replied the Swedish woman.

&quot;&#39;Eighty-six,&quot; Arine said to herself. &quot;That&#39;s about ten months before 
Mia was born.&quot;

&quot;Do you think that there&#39;s some kind of connection between Mia and 
Johan?&quot; Yvette asked the blond-haired girl.

&quot;Back in Paris,&quot; Arine said, &quot;Johan told me about his twin brother, 
Rikhard. It seems that Rikhard and Erika were married twenty years ago. 
Rikhard had a heart condition that killed him when he had sex with 
Erika. Johan said that he caught up with Erika in the Far East. Mia&#39;s 
parents found her in Japan, and she has a heart condition just like 
Rikhard!&quot;

&quot;Rikhard Mustanen must have impregnated Erika,&quot; said Fredrika. &quot;Erika 
fled just a few days after the Dagomar Clan rescued her, she probably 
didn&#39;t know yet that she was pregnant. Ten months later, Fredrika finds 
herself in Japan, and gives birth to Mia.&quot;

&quot;My God!&quot; Sam cried. Mia is Erika Dagomar&#39;s daughter!&quot;

Pierre then added, &quot;...and Johan&#39;s niece.&quot;

----------

&quot;That&#39;s a flight for two to Helsinki,&quot; Odin spoke to the travel agent on 
the phone. &quot;Yes, from Zurich to Helsinki.&quot;

As Odin spoke with the travel agent, John concentrated on the Red Ruby 
in his hand. &quot;Brother,&quot; he spoke to the jewel that he held. &quot;I am sorry 
to awaken you again, but I am in desperate need of your guidance.&quot;

The Ruby glowed red as Johan tapped into its power. Odin noticed the red 
glow and looked at Johan. &quot;Sir Johan?&quot; he asked as the red glow of the 
Ruby engulfed Johan&#39;s body as well. As the glowing of the Ruby and Johan 
stopped, Odin asked, &quot;Sir Johan, what was that?&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t leave yet,&quot; Johan announced.

Odin then spoke into the phone, &quot;Could you hold please?&quot; Odin set the 
phone down and yelled at the tall man before him, &quot;Johan, have you lost 
your mind? We must return as soon as possible! Lord Blake needs your 
help!&quot;

&quot;I just spoke with my brother,&quot; Johan said. Odin stared blankly at 
Johan, surprised by what his subject had just said. Johan explained, 
&quot;Part of his spirit was still inside his white sapphire when he died and 
that sapphire became part of this Ruby, so Rikhard&#39;s spirit is inside 
this Ruby. I can commune with his spirit and he has told me what to do.&quot; 
After a pause, Johan spoke again, &quot;My niece needs my help. And I will 
give her my help.&quot;

----------

Sam, Yvette, and Pierre stood over Lena Dagomar, regarding the physical 
similarities that she had to Mia. &quot;How could we have missed something so 
obvious?&quot; Sam wondered.

&quot;Arrogance on the part of the Jewel Summoners,&quot; Pierre said. &quot;We thought 
we had everything all figured out. However, it just shows you that 
although powerful, we are still human. We cannot know everything there 
is to know about the universe.&quot;

As Pierre finished speaking, Sam sensed something from the other side of 
the infirmary. He saw that Arine was sitting on Mia&#39;s bed, her golden 
hair sparkling as she held Mia&#39;s hand. Sam walked over to the blonde and 
asked, &quot;Arine, what are you doing?&quot;

&quot;What I can,&quot; Arine responded. &quot;If I can extend Mia&#39;s life only by a few 
days, it&#39;ll be worth it.&quot;

&quot;I think you could use some rest,&quot; Sam suggested.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t rest,&quot; said Arine. &quot;Not until I&#39;m certain that Mia is going to 
live a full, healthy life.&quot; Knowing that it would be useless to argue 
with Arine, Sam simply nodded and started walking back to join Pierre 
and Yvette. However, it was just as Sam was beginning to leave that he 
sensed something else from Arine&#39;s general area. Arine&#39;s hair stopped 
sparkling and she looked at the Sapphire in her hand, which had started 
glowing blue. &quot;The Sapphire?&quot; Arine wondered.

&quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; asked Sam.

&quot;Someone is using corundum to lock onto the Sapphire,&quot; Arine said. She 
then said with an ominous tone of voice, &quot;He&#39;s here.&quot;

&quot;Johan,&quot; Sam said, realizing what Arine just had. &quot;I&#39;ll warn the 
others.&quot;

&quot;Wait,&quot; Arine said as Sam was starting to go off to warn Pierre of 
Johan&#39;s approach. Arine said, &quot;He&#39;s not here to fight.&quot;

&quot;What for then?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;I can&#39;t be certain,&quot; said Arine, &quot;But I think it&#39;s...to bargain.&quot;

&quot;Bargain?&quot; asked a surprised Sam.

&quot;That&#39;s what I sense. It&#39;s difficult to tell exactly what he&#39;s thinking; 
he&#39;s very closed. But I believe that he&#39;s here...to negotiate.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like the Johan we know,&quot; said Sam.

&quot;I agree,&quot; said Arine.

Sam walked over to Pierre to see that the Frenchman was holding a 
glowing yellow Pyrite crystal. &quot;Lord Pierre,&quot; said Sam.

&quot;Sam,&quot; said Felix, his voice now one of fear, &quot;Lord Felix senses the 
activation of the Ruby! Johan must have survived passing through the 
Array!&quot;

&quot;Lord Pierre,&quot; Sam tried to calm the man, &quot;Arine sensed the Ruby&#39;s 
presence as well. What&#39;s unusual is that Arine believes that Johan is 
not coming to fight, but to bargain.&quot;

&quot;Do bargain?&quot; Pierre asked. Sam nodded. &quot;That IS unusual,&quot; Pierre 
agreed. &quot;We must be very careful. For Johan to change motives so 
suddenly is too suspicious to ignore.&quot; Pierre held up his pyrite crystal 
again to send a message to Lord Felix. &quot;Should the Clan Leaders confront 
Johan?&quot; he asked Arine.

Arine concentrated for a moment, using her elfin powers to get a feel 
for the situation and come up with a course of action. &quot;No,&quot; she 
replied. &quot;That would not be wise. It would be better if it were people 
that Johan knows. Pierre, you would be the best person to go since you 
have the most experience with Johan, and you have the closest 
relationship to him too. You&#39;ve been &#39;friends&#39; for almost 20 years.&quot;

&quot;That is true,&quot; Pierre said. The pyrite crystal in Pierre&#39;s hand stopped 
glowing. &quot;The Clan Leaders have called off the offensive,&quot; he stated. 
&quot;Right now, the Jewel Summoners are completely defensive.

&quot;Good,&quot; Arine said. &quot;We don&#39;t want to threaten Johan with an attack on 
him. But just in case he changes his mind and decides to fight, I think 
I should go with you. You might not be able to stand up to him without 
an elf at your side.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Pierre said.

As Pierre and Arine were about to go to the surface to meet with Johan, 
Mia said, &quot;Arine?&quot; Arine turned to the brunette to listen to what she 
had to say. &quot;I have to go with you.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Pierre said, very surprised by Mia&#39;s statement.

&quot;Why?&quot; asked Sam. &quot;You can&#39;t go up there! It&#39;s too dangerous, especially 
in your condition!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know why,&quot; the brunette said, &quot;but I know that I have to be 
there.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; said Arine, surprised by the truth of Mia&#39;s statement. &quot;I 
sense that Mia has some role yet to play. I don&#39;t know why either, but 
she does have to come with us to meet with Johan.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot; Sam cried.

&quot;I&#39;m dead serious!&quot; Arine countered.

Arine started helping Mia out of bed. &quot;I can&#39;t let you do this!&quot; said 
Sam, running at Arine. Arine reacted to Sam&#39;s planned attack by aiming a 
glowing blue Sapphire at Sam. For fear of getting hit by a blast of 
elfin magic, Sam stopped dead in his tracks.

&quot;Please, Sam,&quot; said Arine, trying to sound composed. &quot;Trust me on this 
one.&quot; When Sam did not respond, Arine knew that Sam had given in to her 
command, and so lowered the Sapphire. &quot;Come on, Mia,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s 
go.&quot; With that, Pierre, Arine, and Mia exited the infirmary and made 
their way to the surface.

----------

As the three of them got to the roof, Pierre, Arine, and Mia saw a 
glowing, red ball of light jumping from rooftop to rooftop toward them. 
As the ball of light landed on the roof of the French bakery, they could 
clearly see that the ball of red light was in fact the Red Ruby of 
Alvara...and that it was being held by Johan Mustanen. &quot;And so,&quot; said 
the Finn, seeing the three people standing before him, &quot;we meet again.&quot;

&quot;Johan!&quot; cried Pierre in dismay. &quot;How did you recover so quickly?&quot;

&quot;Because he has the powers of the elf,&quot; Arine sensed. &quot;My powers.&quot;

&quot;You can sense the mystical energies emanating from me, can&#39;t you, 
Arine?&quot; Johan asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the blonde replied.

Johan then looked at Mia and his face took on an expression that none of 
them had seen on his face before, and expression of caring. Smiling, 
Johan said, &quot;Mia-chan.&quot;

Pierre, Arine, and Mia were all surprised by what Johan had said. &quot;What 
did you just say?&quot; Arine asked.

&quot;I said, &#39;Mia-chan,&#39;&quot; Johan replied. He then proceeded to explain, 
&quot;&#39;Chan&#39; is a Japanese honorific used to--&quot;

&quot;I know what &#39;chan&#39; means,&quot; said a very protective Arine. &quot;What right do 
you have to call her &#39;Mia-chan&#39;?!&quot;

Johan replied, &quot;You must have realized the truth by now, Arine. Mia is 
my niece.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Pierre said, &quot;you&#39;ve found out too, Johan.&quot;

&quot;I have.&quot; The Finn then turned to the brunette and said, &quot;Mia-chan, it&#39;s 
time for you to come with me.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Mia asked.

&quot;You poor girl,&quot; Johan said in a sympathetic tone. &quot;Living in this world 
for nineteen years with no ties to your true origins. You don&#39;t have to 
be alone any more, unsure about what life has in store for you. You are 
one of the Mustanen Clan. I can teach you all that you desire to know 
about me, our clan&#39;s history, even dating back to the time of the 
elves.&quot;

&quot;Oh my God,&quot; said Arine, rolling her eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t pull that crap on her, 
Johan!&quot; Arine turned to Mia and said, &quot;He did the exact same thing to 
me, he tricked me into believing him so he could convince me to join him 
to attack the Jewel Summoners.&quot; Arine turned back to Johan and said, 
&quot;You want her to join you in your quest too, Johan?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; the tall man said. &quot;This is purely to reunite her with 
her heritage.&quot;

&quot;You may want Mia to know her heritage,&quot; Arine said, &quot;but you are 
lying.&quot; Johan was mildly surprised by Arine&#39;s statement. &quot;Empathy, 
Johan,&quot; Arine explained. &quot;I can sense other people&#39;s emotions and I know 
when someone is telling the truth or not. You plan to use Mia just like 
you used me!&quot;

Johan then said, &quot;You haven&#39;t been able to save Mia, have you?&quot; Arine 
jumped as if she had just been kicked in the stomach. &quot;Simply touching 
skin isn&#39;t enough,&quot; Johan continued. &quot;Mia needs an infusion of elfin DNA 
in order to live a healthy life.&quot; Turning back to Mia, Johan said, &quot;Mia, 
I have infused myself with Arine&#39;s elfin powers. I have the technology 
to do so. I can save you, Mia. I can do for you what I did to myself.&quot;

&quot;Johan,&quot; said Arine, sensing something strange about the tall man in 
front of her. &quot;Your mystical energies. They&#39;re out of balance.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Johan asked, confused about what Arine had said.

&quot;There is something very wrong inside of you,&quot; said Arine. &quot;Those elfin 
genes that you injected into yourself, they&#39;re not naturally occurring. 
I can already sense that you&#39;re losing control. If you do the same thing 
to Mia, it will destroy her!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; said Johan. &quot;I have been 
taught about the elves my whole life. A few days ago, you had no idea 
that elves even existed. What would you know about elfin powers?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m telling you Johan,&quot; Arine cried, &quot;you are not in control of your 
powers! If your powers are not contained, they will soon begin to alter 
your body&#39;s physiology!&quot;

&quot;Mia is my family,&quot; Johan asserted, &quot;and I will have my niece properly 
taken care of!&quot; Johan aimed a glowing Red Ruby at Arine. &quot;If you try to 
rob me of all that I have left of my brother, then you will be making a 
great mistake!&quot;

Arine aimed a glowing Blue Sapphire at Johan and said, &quot;You will not 
survive for another year with those elfin genes inside of you, Johan. I 
won&#39;t let you do to Mia what you have done to yourself.&quot;

Seeing that the situation was getting out of control, Pierre held up a 
pyrite crystal, hoping to alert the other Jewel Summoners to the eminent 
danger. However, Johan saw the pyrite crystal in Pierre&#39;s hand and threw 
an attack from the Ruby at him, knocking the yellow crystal from the 
Jewel Summoner&#39;s hand. As Johan threw his first attack of the night, 
Arine fought back.

----------

Arine fired a blast of mystical energy at Johan from the Sapphire. Johan 
dodged out of the way and fired a similar attack at Arine from the Ruby. 
Arine dodged out of the way and continued running at Johan. As the 
blonde reached the Finn, they started attacking each other with their 
bare fists. However, every attack that they threw were either blocked or 
dodged by the opposing fighter.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Johan as he blocked another one of Arine&#39;s 
punches. &quot;You can&#39;t seem to land a punch on me.&quot;

Arine smiled and said, &quot;You can&#39;t seem to land an attack either, Johan.&quot; 
Arine attempted another punch and Johan jumped clear of the attack, did 
a back flip in the air, and landed on the roof of the building behind 
him. &quot;Are you running, Johan?&quot; Arine taunted,

&quot;Far from it.&quot; Johan waved the glowing Ruby around, summoning a powerful 
force that threw Arine headlong toward him. Caught off-guard by the 
mystical force, Arine could not react in time to avoid Johan&#39;s fist 
hitting her in the face, knocking her to the ground. &quot;Perhaps you didn&#39;t 
know about the amplifier gene that my family carries,&quot; said Johan. &quot;All 
of my elfin abilities are doubled with it.&quot;

&quot;Johan,&quot; Arine moaned. &quot;Please listen to me.&quot;

&quot;I will NOT listen to a friend of the Jewel Summoners!&quot; Johan barked. 
Johan fired another attack from the Ruby, but Arine rolled out of the 
way, using her momentum to cartwheel herself up onto her feet.

&quot;Stop using your powers!&quot; Arine cried. &quot;You&#39;re only quickening the 
deterioration of your body! Surely you can sense that your powers are 
taking control of you.

&quot;What I sense,&quot; said Johan, &quot;is that my powers are much more powerful 
than yours!&quot;

Johan threw another attack at Arine, throwing her back to the roof of 
the French bakery, where Mia and Pierre were still looking on. &quot;Arine!&quot; 
cried Mia as her beloved landed in front of her.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mia,&quot; Arine said as she got to her feet. &quot;I&#39;m all right.&quot;

Looking over at Johan from across the alley, Arine noticed Johan hold up 
the Ruby. Arine sensed what Johan was about to do and she held up the 
Sapphire as well. A red flash of light came from the Ruby, and Arine 
counteracted the flash with the Sapphire. When she looked at Pierre and 
Mia, Arine found that they were completely still, not even breathing. 
&quot;So Arine,&quot; Johan said, &quot;you weren&#39;t affected by my stopping of time.&quot;

&quot;I reacted to what I sensed was about to happen,&quot; said Arine.

&quot;I should keep Mia frozen in time until I have cured her of her heart 
condition,&quot; Johan said.

&quot;Johan,&quot; explained Arine, &quot;she&#39;s frozen in time only because her mind 
thinks it is. Her brain cells are still functioning normally, and with 
all of her bodily functions stopped, her brain is losing oxygen!&quot;

Arine held up the Sapphire. The Sapphire glowed blue for a moment, and 
Pierre and Mia became unfrozen. However, while Arine was distracted by 
pulling Mia and Pierre back into normal time, she was hit by another 
blast of mystical energy from the Ruby, throwing her to the next 
building over.

Johan waved the Ruby around, calling forth a force that pulled Mia 
toward him. Johan took Mia&#39;s body in his arms, to which the brunette 
screamed, &quot;No! Let me go!&quot;

Arine got to her feet and saw that Mia was struggling in Johan&#39;s arms. 
&quot;Johan! Let Mia go!&quot; Arine cried, hoping that Mia would not become 
worked up enough to bring on another cardiac episode.&quot;

&quot;Calm down, Mia,&quot; said Johan in a soothing voice. &quot;If you don&#39;t stay 
calm, you&#39;re going to have another attack. Let me take care of you. Let 
your true family take care of you like we were meant to.&quot;

Just then, the Ruby activated for no apparent reason. A flash of red 
light emanated from the Ruby, throwing Mia back towards Pierre, causing 
both of them to fall over the edge of the roof of the French bakery. 
However, before they hit the ground, Pierre pulled out a spinel crystal 
and summoned a crystal vehicle just below them to slow their descent 
until they reached the ground. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Pierre asked the 
frightened girl in his arms.

&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Mia.

Johan looked at the Ruby in confusion. &quot;What was that?&quot; he wondered.

&quot;I told you,&quot; said Arine. &quot;The elfin genes that you injected into your 
body have caused a mutation. If you had been born with those genes, you 
wouldn&#39;t be losing control of your powers like this. It will destroy you 
if your elfin genes are not neutralized.&quot;

&quot;You would have me give up these powers?&quot; said Johan.

&quot;What&#39;s more important,&quot; Arine asked, &quot;your powers or your life?&quot; Both 
Arine and Johan jumped back to the roof of the French bakery and started 
throwing punches at each other. &quot;Please, Johan!&quot; cried Arine as she 
dodged Johan&#39;s fists. &quot;This is for your own good!&quot;

As the two elfin descendants fought, they happened to aim Alvara&#39;s 
crystals at each other at the same time. Both crystals glowed, trying to 
overcome the other crystal&#39;s power.  A ball of magenta light formed in 
between the two crystals where their mystical energies collided, the 
energy building between them. Finally, the ball of magenta light 
exploded, sending both Arine and Johan flying away in opposite 
directions. As Arine flew through the air, she lost her hold on the 
Sapphire as she flew earthward.

While Johan handed safely on the roof of another building, skidding to a 
stop on both feet, Arine&#39;s body crashed into the roof of another 
building, rolling to a stop just before falling off the opposite edge. 
At the same time, Mia and Pierre rose to the roof on the spinel vehicle 
that Pierre had summoned. At seeing her beloved lying motionless at the 
far edge of the roof, Mia cried out, &quot;Arine!&quot; and ran to the 
blond-haired girl. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; the brunette asked.

Arine slowly opened her eyes and looked at the girl looking down upon 
her. &quot;Mia,&quot; she said weakly.

&quot;Can you stand?&quot; Mia asked.

Arine tried to lift herself up onto her feet, but then groaned in pain 
and collapsed again. &quot;No,&quot; Arine replied to Mia&#39;s question. &quot;I think my 
left hip is shattered, and my leg is dislocated.&quot;

Johan looked back to the roof of the French bakery and saw the blue 
crystal lying there. &quot;The Sapphire,&quot; he said to himself as he jumped 
back to the rooftop.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; said Arine as Johan picked up the Blue Sapphire.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you get it, Arine,&quot; said Johan. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter if I 
live or die. All that matters to me is avenging the destruction of the 
elves. Why do you protect the very people that destroyed your 
ancestors?&quot;

&quot;Is that all that matters to you, Johan?&quot; Arine seethed. &quot;Is revenge the 
only driving force in your life now? What about the new age of the 
elves? Doesn&#39;t that matter to you? Killing more people won&#39;t make things 
right again.&quot;

&quot;I see where you&#39;re going with this,&quot; said Johan. &quot;It&#39;s not going to 
work.&quot;

&quot;Throwing your life away won&#39;t bring back your uncle...&quot;

&quot;Shut up.&quot;

&quot;...or your father...&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot;

&quot;...or your brother!&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!!!&quot; Johan held up both the Ruby and the Sapphire in his hands, 
both of them glowing brightly as he tapped into their power. The blue 
light of the Sapphire and the red light of the Ruby fused into a bright 
magenta light at the distance that Arine and Mia were at.

&quot;This is not good,&quot; said Arine.

Just then, a gust of wind started blowing from Johan&#39;s position. &quot;What&#39;s 
happening?&quot; Mia asked, caught off guard by the wind.

&quot;Johan is feeding all of his energy into the Ruby and the Sapphire,&quot; 
said Arine. &quot;With his amplifier gene and both of Alvara&#39;s crystals, 
nothing will be able to hold back the energy he&#39;s about to throw at us.&quot; 
It was just then that Arine noticed something strange about Mia. Ever 
since they had gone shopping at the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, Mia had always worn 
a pair of diamond earrings that she had bought there. However, as the 
wind from Alvara&#39;s crystals blew Mia&#39;s hair out of the way of her 
pointed ears, Arine could clearly see that there was no earring on Mia&#39;s 
left ear. &quot;Mia?&quot; she asked. &quot;Where&#39;s your left earring?&quot;

Mia brought her hand to her left ear and felt that her earring was 
missing. She then looked around herself and said, &quot;Where&#39;s Pierre?&quot;

As Arine and Mia looked back toward Johan, they saw Pierre standing in 
front of him. He was aiming something toward Johan in his hand. It was 
the earring! &quot;Is he...?&quot; Arine trailed off.

&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Mia cried as she realized what Pierre was doing.

&quot;These girls are the key to the future of the elves, Johan,&quot; Pierre 
pleaded his case. &quot;Do not destroy them to settle the score with someone 
who is only trying to help you.&quot; Johan did not seem to react to Pierre&#39;s 
statement. &quot;Please Johan,&quot; Pierre begged, tears forming in his eyes, 
&quot;don&#39;t make me do this.&quot;

Johan and Pierre simply looked into each other&#39;s eyes for a moment. 
Johan almost seemed ready to stand down and end the feud. However, he 
instead fed all of the energy that he had gathered into the Ruby and 
Sapphire that he had in his hands. Seeing that Johan was about to fire 
all of the mystical energy that he had gathered, Pierre held up the 
earring, the crystal stud glowing bright white.

----------

Having sensed the activation of both the Ruby and the Sapphire, the 
Jewel Summoners knew that Arine and Johan had been fighting. Knowing 
that they had to help the elf in any way they could, they were boarding 
the elevators to the surface to help fight Johan. &quot;Come on! Come on!&quot; 
said Lord Giovanni as he herded the members of the Valentino Clan to the 
elevators.

&quot;Go on,&quot; Alana said, guiding the members of the Lancestor Clan to the 
elevators, &quot;protect the elf.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you do,&quot; said Lord Felix, &quot;don&#39;t let Johan--&quot; However, before 
Felix could finish his sentence, he was overcome with a strange, 
extremely strong feeling of some impending calamity.

&quot;What is that?&quot; Fredrika wondered, obviously noticing the same feeling.

All at once, all of the Jewel Summoners became disoriented by the 
upheaval of the surrounding mystical energies, many of them nearly 
losing their balance.

&quot;It&#39;s powerful,&quot; said Alana.

&quot;I&#39;ve never felt anything like it before,&quot; groaned Giovanni.

Then, Felix realized what was happening. &quot;Could it be...?!

----------

Mystical energies in the form of white light swirled around Pierre as he 
tapped into the power of the diamond earring that he held in his hand. 
As the light emanating from the earring began to envelop Pierre, the 
Frenchman looked back at the two girls staring at him in awe. Tears 
streaming down his cheeks, Pierre said to Mia and Arine, &quot;Tell 
Yvette...that I&#39;m sorry.&quot; As Pierre spoke his last words, the city of 
Zurich was engulfed by the white light of the diamond.
