<pre>Arine Lloyd sat in the train depot as she waited the forty-five minutes 
between trains. It was eleven in the morning, and she had left at two in 
the afternoon of the previous day. She hoped to arrive at her final 
destination some time around midnight if all went well.

It had seemed like a good idea at the time; go by train from Lincoln, 
Nebraska to New York to save on the cost of a plane ticket, and see the 
country. Of course, she&#39;d never tried to sleep on a train before. 
Uncomfortable didn&#39;t even begin to describe it. Her neck was sore, her 
shoulders ached, and she had maybe three hours sleep all night.

Arine&#39;s attention was currently being taken up by the couple sitting in 
the depot some twenty feet in front of her. She was fairly certain the 
man was psychotic; the woman (probably his wife) was trying to keep him 
under control as he yelled about his handheld game system not working. 
She nervously pushed some of the loose locks of her blonde hair out of 
her eyes as the man balled his hands into fists and started hitting 
himself on top of his head. She looked away from the spectacle and began 
to study the depot she found herself in. It was a building with squared 
columns reaching up towards the ceiling, the alternating brown, cream 
and light orange tiles lining the walls and columns giving the whole an 
ochre feel.

The man was continuing to hit himself on the head as he complained first 
of the game, then of how long they&#39;d been waiting for the woman&#39;s 
brother to come and pick them up. They were both middle aged, and the 
man sported five o-clock shadow while the woman&#39;s had unkempt hair. Both 
looked like they&#39;d slept in their clothes.

As she watched, the woman tried to suggest something in his ears. She 
could only guess it was about some sort of medication because he started 
yelling about how he didn&#39;t want to take &quot;it,&quot; because &quot;it&quot; made him 
&quot;sick as a motherfucker.&quot;

Arine finally decided she had enough of the dysfunctional couple. She 
put her backpack on, grabbed her carry on luggage and went outside the 
building. She had thirty-five minutes now before the last leg of her 
journey began, and outside the sun was shining in a beautiful blue sky 
without a cloud in sight. As birds flew overhead she sat beneath an oak 
tree and breathed a sigh of relief.

She still couldn&#39;t get over her luck. Fresh out of college with a 
journalism major, not only was her resume accepted by one of the dozen 
or so journals she sent it out to, but once she finally arrived in New 
York she already had an assignment waiting for her.

Of course, she had been rather hoping for something more along the lines 
of investigative reporting for a hard-hitting news journal. Instead, she 
was starting out her career for something called Astounding Fantasy, a 
magazine dedicated to science fiction and fantasy stories. And her first 
assignment was interviewing some recluse who wrote a book about elves.

Arine never understood the whole thing with elves, trolls, dragons and 
wizards sporting long pointy caps and beards down to their navels. Even 
so, she realized that if she was going to conduct this interview 
properly, she had to read the novel this Mia person wrote. She was now 
two-thirds of the way through, and hoped to be finished by the time she 
arrived at her final destination. She pulled the book out and started to 
read.

The novel was astounding to Arine; not a simple sword and sorcery tale 
at all, but a piece brimming with political intrigue and treachery that 
spanned multiple generations, it left her feeling both melancholy and 
uplifted at the same time.

After a bit, she checked her watch. She quickly placed a bookmark in the 
novel, grabbed her backpack and carry-on luggage, and headed back to the 
train depot.

....

The bookshelves along the one side of the room were filled with old 
grimoires, Arabic, Latin and Old English manuscripts, and ancient 
histories of long forgotten realms and peoples. There was also a suit of 
medieval armor, candles spread all throughout the room, a display rack 
of medieval armory, and an owl sitting freely upon a perch near an open 
window in the study. Finally, looking out of place in the room, was a 
table with a laptop on it, used by its owner for writing her stories.

The door opened, and an attractive looking young brunet came into the 
room carrying a cup of chamomile tea. Suddenly all the candles in the 
room came to life as flame sprang up from out of nowhere onto their 
wicks.

Mia Shea pushed a lock of her hair back, her fingers brushing against 
where her ear came to a point. She was a walking anachronism, and she 
knew it. Most of her elven race had either lost their heritage through 
intermarriage with humans long ago or else were killed off in wars 
fought in the dimly forgotten past. She was an elf living in the modern 
world, and as far as she was aware the last of her kind. She took a 
melancholy sip of her tea as she looked at the calendar.

Her eyes suddenly went wide.

&quot;The interview.&quot; she groaned. Tomorrow around tea-time, she had been 
scheduled by the publisher of her novel to be interviewed by someone 
from a fantasy magazine. She turned away from the calendar and went over 
to a bag hanging by a nail from one of the bookshelves. She opened the 
bag and removed the twelve small rune stones. She hoped to get the 
interview over with as soon as possible, and was curious to see how much 
of an inconvenience this interviewer would be. She went over to a table, 
cast the stones, and looked.

&quot;What the...&quot; she asked as she tilted her head in disbelief at what she 
was being told. She cast them again.

Same reading.

She cast a third time.

Again, same reading.

She stared at the stones silently for a few seconds before finally 
picking them back up and putting them away again in the bag. As she hung 
the bag back up on its nail, she turned around to see the owl watching 
her. As the animal moved its head a bit, Mia chuckled.

&quot;Well Althor,&quot; she said as she reached over and pet the bird&#39;s head, &quot;It 
looks like tomorrow may be interesting.&quot;

With that, she finished off her tea and turned to leave the study, the 
candles all going out as she left the room.

-------

Arine woke up to the sound of the buzzer at the hotel she had rented 
online before leaving Nebraska. She would begin hunting for an apartment 
later she resolved as she hopped into the shower.

After the shower she dressed as professionally as possible and headed 
over by taxi to the publishing headquarters of Astounding Fantasy. After 
a quick tour of the offices by a man with a mustache and slicked-back 
graying hair that she later found out was to be her new editor, she was 
given the address to the private home of the woman she was to interview.

After a forty-five minute bus trip that took her out of the city, she 
was dropped off at a bus terminal in a small New York town. She pulled 
her backpack off and opened it to make sure she had everything she was 
going to need, oblivious to the figure making her way over to her.

&quot;Let&#39;s see...&quot; Arine mumbled to herself, &quot;Notepad, pens, tape recorder, 
copy of The Fey of Trifalcamore...&quot;

&quot;Arine?&quot; a pleasant, almost musical voice asked, &quot;Arine Lloyd?&quot; The 
blonde looked up to see an attractive young woman with chestnut-brown 
hair smiling pleasantly at her. Her eyes were a beautiful shade of brown 
as well, and she had a warm and welcoming feel about her. She wore a 
pair of blue jeans and an Irish knit sweater. What attracted Arine&#39;s 
attention most though were the woman&#39;s ears, which came to points at the 
end. They, together with the rest of her appearance, gave the young 
woman an attractively earthy atmosphere.

&quot;Yes.&quot; The reporter finally said as she once again found her voice. &quot;Are 
you here to pick me up for Miss Shea?&quot; she asked. The brown-haired woman 
chuckled a bit at that.

&quot;I am Miss Shea. You can just call me Mia.&quot; she said in a faint Irish 
accent which, combined with her physical beauty, made Arine&#39;s heart 
flutter, &quot;Come on, my house is only a ways away from here. We can walk.&quot; 
she said as she smiled again at the blonde.

Arine simply nodded, and followed the shorter young woman. As they 
walked, the blonde tried to make sense of the situation. What was she 
thinking? She was on assignment to interview this woman, and here she 
was falling for her. She&#39;d been in a relationship with a woman before in 
college, but nothing came of it. But even with that relationship, there 
was never this sort of instant attraction she was now feeling as she 
walked next to this earthy little...

&quot;Well, here we are.&quot; Mia said, pointing to a quaint little home 
surrounded by trees. Something about the place had an almost fairy-tale 
like quality to it. As they started up the path to the porch, Arine 
turned once again to Mia.

&quot;Forgive me for saying so,&quot; she began, &quot;But aren&#39;t you somewhat young to 
be an author?&quot;

Mia turned to her with a smirk, &quot;And aren&#39;t you a bit young to be a 
reporter?&quot;

&quot;Touch&eacute;.&quot; Arine said as Mia opened the door. As the smell of spiced 
incense and wild flowers exuded from the entrance, the blond followed 
the brunet inside.</pre>
