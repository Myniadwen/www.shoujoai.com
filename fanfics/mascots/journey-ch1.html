<h1>Journey</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jpeterson.html">J. Peterson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The air was cool and crisp as the first rays of sunlight had not yet 
washed over the rolling hills of the meadowlands, and she shivered 
slightly as she untangled herself from her sleep skins and got to her 
knees to poke at the embers that remained of the fire she had lit the 
night before. The scent of moss tickled her nostrils and mixed with the 
smell of burning wood as she coaxed the fire back to life, tossing a few 
branches from the pile she had gathered onto the glowing embers. The 
morning was cold, indeed, and she eagerly pulled over her cloak, 
wrapping the blue fabric around her body for warmth.

As the crackling flames licked at her offering, she curiously examined 
the small protective circle she had placed around her resting place, and 
nodded in satisfaction at finding her belongings undisturbed. Pulling 
her satchel to her side, she searched out the two items she needed for 
her morning bath; a carved horn comb and a small leather pouch 
containing a lump of soap. Had she been home, she would also have had a 
soft skin to dry herself with, but the journey from Alabu to Lejre was a 
long one, and there was no sense in hauling more weight than absolutely 
necessary.

Setting the bag of soap on the grass beneath her feet, she sat back on 
her haunches and studied the comb in the light of the fire. The long 
teeth were testament to the size of the horn the comb had been carved 
from, and the intricate carvings that covered the narrow handhold an 
indicator of the craftsman&#39;s skill.

A smile pulled at her lips and lent a small sparkle to the blue eyes 
that had turned almost russet in the firelight. Old Regnar had carved 
combs for as long as she could remember, selling his goods to the 
traders and travelers that often came to Alabu. He had given this comb 
to her as a gift, though, and she treasured it all the more now that she 
was on her own. It was a reminder of her home, and of a dear friend she 
hoped she would get to see again before he left this world.

The song of a single blackbird broke the silence, and as others joined 
in to announce the new day, Arine broke from her musings and picked up 
the soap and, as an afterthought, a slim, pointed stick and a thin blade 
made from flint. She stood and made her way across the dew-moistened 
grass towards the chattering of a nearby stream, pulling her plain cloth 
shift tighter around her body to ward off the cool breeze. Summer was 
coming, as was evident from the fresh, green leaves on the birch trees 
that seemed to cluster at the edges of the stream, but spring still had 
enough of a hold that the early morning air was fairly snippy.

Arine halted by the edge of the stream and knelt on the moist soil that 
lined the banks. The comb and pouch were sat carefully on a large, flat 
rock that jutted out over the water, and she hefted the pointed stick in 
both hands as she peered intently into the water. Time passed as she 
held her position stoically, the stick raised and ready to strike as she 
sat at the water&#39;s edge, still as a statue until a small motion in the 
water caught her eye and she shot the weapon forward in a savage, 
precise thrust. The stick was then brought back out of the water, and 
the freshwater bass was laid on the rock next to her other belongings.

She studied the fish for a moment as she untied the small braids on 
either side of her face and laid the leather straps beside her comb, 
then nodded her head in satisfaction. It was decently sized, and should 
have enough meat to suffice for her morning meal; possibly more than 
that. While she couldn&#39;t keep any excess food around for very long since 
she had no means to prevent the meat from spoiling, it should easily be 
able to last until she felt hungry again.

With that reassuring thought, she picked up the fish and the flint blade 
and proceeded to gut and thoroughly clean her catch in the clear water. 
Once that task was accomplished, she pulled off her shift and stepped 
into the water herself. The instant prickling of icy needles made her 
wince, and after a deep, calming breath, she swiftly dunked her entire 
body into the water to quickly adjust to the lower temperature.

Effective as that method was, she couldn&#39;t quite avoid the unsteady 
exhale that trickled forth as she poked her torso back above the water, 
and she quickly retrieved the soap from the pouch and set about cleaning 
first her body, then her hair. Her shift, she idly acknowledged, could 
use a good cleaning too, but would have to wait until she was in a 
position where she could let it dry afterwards, preferably during the 
midday hours where she could rest in the shade while the clothing dried 
in the sun.

Arine quickly pulled herself out of the water as she finished, and spent 
a little while stomping her legs and clapping her arms around herself in 
order to warm up muscles cold and stiff from the icy water. Since 
pulling a dry shift over a soaked body was silly at best, she instead 
used the cloth as a makeshift satchel for her comb, soap and the two 
leather straps. The cleaned fish and the spear were held in her free 
hand as she made the short trek back to her resting spot naked, letting 
the slowly warming breeze dry her body. On this morning, she decided, 
combing her hair would definitely be better done in front of a warm 
fire.

***

The quiet of the pre-dawn surrounded her as she silently made her way 
through the forest. The well-worn leather moccasins on her feet made 
only a minimum of noise against the forest floor, and she took care to 
walk slowly through the dense thicket. Her eyes and ears were peeled as 
she neared the part of the river where the deer came to drink in the 
mornings, and she instinctively reached one hand over her shoulder to 
touch the quiver of arrows that rested snugly against her back.

Full.

Her trained gaze took in her surroundings as she flexed her other hand 
around the handle of her flatbow. The elm wood was smooth and slightly 
cool to the touch as she absently rubbed her thumb over the edge of the 
leather-covered handle, her head cocking slightly as she sought out a 
certain tree that always had an excellent view of the drinking spot. On 
locating it, she stealthily made her way over to the thick trunk and, 
after checking that the nettle fiber bowstring was securely wrapped 
around one end of the bow, fastened the carefully crafted weapon in her 
belt and started climbing.

As she climbed higher, a part of her mind noticed the increasing 
brightness of the surrounding forest, and she stubbornly increased her 
speed. She hadn&#39;t ever been less than ready when her prey arrived, and 
today certainly wasn&#39;t going to be the first time.

Finally, she made it to her preferred perch. A long, thick branch of the 
old oak stretched out towards the river; stabile enough for her to sit 
several feet from the trunk itself while remaining hidden by the 
numerous leaves. As she settled herself with her legs wrapped around the 
branch and carefully restrung her bow, her keen sense of hearing picked 
up the soft sound of hooves against the forest floor.

Good. She examined the bindings on both ends of the bow and pushed at 
the string to test the tautness. A tiny sound of satisfaction escaped 
her, and she rested one palm on the wood between her legs, leaning her 
weight on the hand as she leaned forward slightly, peering into the 
brightening sunlight with keen interest.

Knowing that her prey was most likely only moments away, she carefully 
set down her bow, letting the weapon balance across the thick branch and 
she pulled her long hair back, fastening the better part of it with a 
simple bobby pin high on the back of her head. A few, shorter strands 
still tickled the sides of her face, but the majority remained in 
position, which severely lessened the chance of it blowing into her eyes 
and ruining her aim later on.

Now, all Mia could do was wait.

A crunch in the thicket to the north of her spot caught her attention, 
and she frowned. The sound was too heavy to have been made by a deer, 
and indeed, as it continued, the dark eyes narrowed dangerously.

An intruder.

Mia&#39;s mind raced. While it wasn&#39;t exactly uncommon for Humanfolk to 
travel through this forest, most of them preferred to stay on the road 
that ran between the trees a few miles to the west. The travelers that 
strayed too far from the road, and thus too far from the patrols that 
the King sent out, were more often than not attacked by the bandits that 
used the dense woods as a hiding place.

So, was this intruder a bandit or a traveler? Prudence dictated caution, 
and Mia swallowed as she pulled an arrow from her quiver and carefully 
set her aim in the direction the sounds were coming from. She had never 
in her 19 years used her skill as a bowman against one of the Humanfolk, 
and she quietly hoped that she wouldn&#39;t have to start on a morning as 
beautiful as this one.

The leaves around her whispered softly as the breeze rustled through 
them, and she held her aim, listening intently as the sounds drew nearer 
and nearer, though she was still unable to see the intruder.

Suddenly, a shrill shriek pierced the silence, and she yelped as a large 
hawk flew directly at her, apparently having taken offense at her 
proximity to its nest. The arrow flew from fingertips suddenly slack 
with surprise, and as her world tilted upside down, she vaguely 
registered the sound of someone screaming.

Only a lifetime of living in the woods kept the young archer from 
falling to her death as she lost her balance, and she instantly 
tightened her legs around the thick branch. While her arrows fell out of 
the quiver from her upside-down position, Mia herself was able to hold 
on and hit the shrieking hawk with the end of her bow. The bird wavered 
in mid-air for a moment and then relented, flying off to a nearby tree 
and continuing to call out impudently as it watched her.

Dark eyes glared at the bird as Mia rapidly fastened the bow between her 
back and her belt and proceeded to make her way back to the ground as 
fast as she could without outright jumping.

She had hit someone. She felt a distinct shakiness course through her 
veins as she jumped off of the lowest branch and literally hit the 
ground running. The previous stealth disappeared completely from her 
movements as she let her legs carry her through the thicket at a 
surprisingly fast clip, heading for the location the scream had come 
from.

Within seconds, she came to a halt at an alarmingly still cloak-covered 
figure. One of her own arrows was jutting out from the person&#39;s 
midsection, and Mia exhaled shakily as she dropped to her knees beside 
the still form and cautiously pushed the blue cloak away to get a better 
look at her accidental victim. The face she saw was that of a Human 
female, probably not older than Mia herself was.

Mia glanced around, noting the position of the satchel the girl would 
have to have been carrying, not to mention the...

&quot;Oh, Mother.&quot; She blanched as she recognized the sturdy, brass-adorned 
distaff that lay parallel with the Human girl&#39;s body, and mentally 
kicked herself. &quot;Not only do I shoot a Human, I shoot a Human seer?&quot; Mia 
bit back a frustrated whimper as she anxiously examined the girl. A 
relieved sigh escaped her as she confirmed that the girl was very much 
alive, but had apparently fallen over when she was hit and knocked 
herself unconscious, if the blood-matted hair on the left side of her 
head was any indication.

Frantically grappling at her belt with one hand, Mia laid the other over 
the girl&#39;s stomach and studied the cloth-covered belly. The fabric was 
liberally soaked with blood, which would explain the growing pallor on 
the unconscious girl&#39;s face, and Mia knew she had to get help fast.

With that in mind, she pulled a horn from her belt and blew forcefully 
into the pointed end, creating a deep, reverberating sound that to most 
would sound much like a moose, but to her own people would be known as 
an urgent call for help. &quot;Please don&#39;t die,&quot; she muttered to the 
oblivious Human as she dropped the horn to the ground and deftly snapped 
off a good bit of the arrow, &quot;help is coming.&quot;

Chewing her lower lip nervously, the young archer proceeded to gently 
lift the fabric of the cloak free of the remaining arrow shaft. A cloth 
shift, turned a sickening color of red, lay beneath, and that as well 
was moved over the shaft and aside very gently as to not disturb the 
wound more than absolutely necessary. Blood aside, the skin beneath was 
surprisingly clean, but Mia nonetheless hissed as she got a good look at 
the wound. The arrow was imbedded a good deal past the head itself, and 
there was no way she would be able to get it loose without causing even 
more damage.

But Friil would. The old healer had helped many survive wounds as 
grievous and worse than this one, and Mia dearly hoped that the streak 
wouldn&#39;t stop now. After all, killing an ordinary Human was bad enough, 
but killing a seer, however unintentional, was as close to suicide as 
one could get. Seers were the part of the Humanfolk that were always in 
touch with the spirit realm; and much like Elven seers, Human seers, 
also known as v&ouml;lvas, were able to not only communicate with the spirit 
realm, but could also do magic on their own.

But a seer so young? Mia shifted her gaze from the wound and studied the 
youthful face curiously. From what she knew, V&ouml;lvas were old women, and 
this girl couldn&#39;t be past her 20th year. Still, the color of her cloak, 
the distaff, along with the calfskin shoes, the tinder belt and the 
pouch of what was most likely seid tools pointed in that direction, even 
if none were truly adorned in the way that she was told they would be.

She shook her head briskly. Right now, the priority was to get the girl 
healed, not speculate on her lot in life. Mia clipped a small pouch from 
her own belt and retrieved several pieces of dried white moss, which she 
pressed against the wound. The moss would not only absorb the blood, but 
also help significantly in slowing down the bleeding; a trait that made 
it the most crucial item for any of her people to carry with them, aside 
from the horn.

Hoof beats and shouts sounded in the distance, and Mia jumped to her 
feet to be seen above the thicket, waving to the three men in Elven 
clothing who, upon spotting her, swiftly turned their horses and 
thundered towards her. &quot;Mia!&quot;

The young archer smiled as she recognized her cousin, Ansten, as the 
lead rider. &quot;I&#39;m alright,&quot; she assured the anxious young man as she 
bolted off of his white steed and ran over to her. &quot;But she isn&#39;t.&quot;

Ansten looked past his cousin to the girl on the ground, and promptly 
paled noticeably. &quot;You shot a seer?&quot; His large green eyes got even 
larger as he turned them on Mia incredulously. &quot;Are you out of your 
mind?&quot;

&quot;It involved a taut bowstring, a territorial hawk and a near-fall from 
40 feet up,&quot; the young woman frowned. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to do it.&quot; She 
dropped to her knees beside the fallen girl again and resumed pressing 
on the wound. &quot;And she&#39;s not dead, but we need to get her back to Friil, 
and fast.&quot;

The dark-haired man looked at the unconscious girl and nodded. &quot;Wise 
idea, cousin.&quot; He frowned as he took in the arrow shaft jutting out from 
the exposed stomach, then turned to his companions. &quot;You two, help us 
out here, then double up for the ride back.&quot; As the men jumped from 
their horses and ran over, Ansten grabbed the bindings one had brought 
and knelt beside his cousin, efficiently securing the bandage around the 
seer&#39;s midriff to keep the white moss in place. &quot;You take Shoi&#39;s horse,&quot; 
he told the archer as he finished tying the bandages. &quot;I&#39;ll hold onto 
her.&quot;

Slightly relieved to have her cousin take charge of an ugly situation, 
Mia nodded and, after securing both her own and the girl&#39;s belongings, 
made her way over to the straw-colored stallion and mounted it. The 
horse fidgeted underneath her weight, and she took care to calm herself 
as much as possible, well aware that the animal could sense her 
uneasiness.

While she waited for her cousin to settle onto his own mount and get the 
girl positioned in front of him, Mia fastened the various items to her 
saddle; a task made slightly more difficult by the fact that her hands 
were shaking. What if the girl didn&#39;t survive? She would be responsible 
for the family that lived on, not knowing what had happened to their 
loved one.

Even worse, she had no way of finding them and passing on the news, 
since she had no idea who the girl even was.

&quot;Mia,&quot; Ansten&#39;s low voice broke through her thoughts, and she glanced 
over to see her cousin on his horse, one arm encircling the wounded 
girl&#39;s ribcage. &quot;Let&#39;s not worry until we know.&quot;

Nodding slightly, Mia took a deep breath and nudged her mount into 
motion as the others did. The animals picked up speed as their riders 
jeered them on, all anxious to get back to their home and praying that 
the hopes they placed in the old healer weren&#39;t placed in vain.

As the sound of the unconscious girl groaning in pain came to her over 
the sound of the rushing wind and the thundering hoof beats, Mia lowered 
her head and closed her eyes. &quot;Please, Mother,&quot; she whispered so quietly 
she could barely hear her own voice. &quot;Let us make it.&quot;

&quot;Let her be safe. Please.&quot; </pre>
