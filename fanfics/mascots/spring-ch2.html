<a href="../mascots/spring-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Arine woke to sunlight shining straight into her eyes. She blinked a bit 
and stretched her arms, yawning. Birds sang outside the window.

Mia.

Images of yesterday came rushing into her mind. She smiled and relaxed, 
lying with her face in the pillow and savouring the memory of the girl&#39;s 
smile. Her friend.

She felt full of energy. After changing into her work clothes she had a 
quick breakfast, then set the threads to be coloured into the big metal 
vats with the dyes and started spinning. She caught herself humming and 
whistling, and sometimes she made a mistake because she had been 
thinking more about Mia than her work. She didn&#39;t mind, though. Even if 
her head was spinning more than the wheel, she wanted to bask in the 
feeling. Tomorrow, or the day after that, she would concentrate better. 
Besides, her deft hands did a good job without much guidance from her 
head. She kept planning all kinds of things to do with her friend. What 
to make for dinner the next time she came over. Most of all, she just 
wanted to walk with Mia on the shore again and talk with her. She hadn&#39;t 
understood how much she had to talk about until Mia came into her life. 
And she wanted to listen to Mia. She was already missing Mia&#39;s voice, 
the gentle and beautiful voice that glided from high and melodic to a 
soft murmur.

She laughed at herself. Her thoughts sounded like she was in love, but 
she was just longing to have more time with her friend. She wondered if 
Mia would come tomorrow or the day after that. She must have a lot of 
work with her family, too. Arine wished it wouldn&#39;t be too long.

In the afternoon she went for a walk on the shore. She left a small note 
on the door in case Mia came, and didn&#39;t go too far. The sandstone 
cliffs were warm from the sun, and she climbed onto a high ledge to read 
a book she had taken with her. In the note she had written where she 
could be found. After a few dozen pages, she came back down and walked 
to the house. The note was still there. She hadn&#39;t really expected Mia 
to come today. Smiling, she went to the garden to do some weeding.

As the sun started to set, Arine walked to the shore again. Yesterday, 
she had planned to walk alone on the beach and watch the sunset, but she 
had forgotten about it after everything else that happened. On her waist 
was a small pouch for collecting the purple seashells. She walked in the 
direction of Falow, wondering how long it would take for her to walk 
there. Laughing to herself, she ran a bit. Yesterday felt like a 
far-away memory, and yet she could still feel Mia&#39;s hair on her cheek, 
the slim hands around Arine as the girl hugged her. There was so much 
she wanted to know about Mia. The birds called as she walked back to the 
house. She hopped over bunches of seaweed, sometimes singing a bit. 
Tonight she would get some good sleep, because Mia might come visit her 
tomorrow.

             .......

The cart rattled and banged as its wheels passed over the hardened ruts 
of the dirt path. The sun was still low, glinting into Mia&#39;s eyes from 
between the trunks of oak trees. Her uncle was singing as he drove the 
cart, and occasionally Mia joined in for the bits she remembered. She 
was sitting on top of the bales of hay loaded onto the cart, the warm 
spring breeze caressing her face and hair. Her uncle had promised to 
take her to Arine&#39;s house in exchange for helping him pack the cart. Her 
arms felt weary from lifting the heavy bales, but she didn&#39;t even notice 
it. It had been three days since she had met Arine, and every day she 
had been all but bouncing from wanting to see her again.

She tried to recall every feature of her friend in her mind. Arine&#39;s 
lovely, thoughtful eyes, as blue as the sea she loved so much. Her long 
yellow hair that flowed in the wind. The small clasp that kept the hair 
from her eyes, and the two small beaded braids. Mia wondered if it was 
all right to go in the morning, but this was the only chance she was 
going to get for the next few days. She could sit in the garden, or walk 
in the woods or the shore all day if Arine needed time to work. As long 
as she could talk with her just a little, to look into her eyes. Among 
her family and kin, she felt loved and cared for, but Arine had made her 
feel so happy that her eyes stung. Arine made her feel like nobody else 
could replace her, that every word she said was precious. She didn&#39;t 
know if it was wise to become so attached to someone after just one 
evening, but she didn&#39;t care. Moving here from the inland, she had 
parted with her friends, each of them leaving for a different family. 
Many would return to their childhome eventually, but many would not. 
Some found new places that comforted their hearts more than the woods 
they had played in as children. Mia didn&#39;t know what she would do, but 
at the moment, all she could occupy her mind with was her new friend.

The cart rolled to the paved road with a clatter. Usually, Mia would 
have felt a bit down at leaving the small forest path, but now she felt 
joyful at reaching the smoother road, since the cart would travel 
faster. She watched the landmarks, her heart beating a bit faster with 
every mile towards Arine&#39;s house. Then suddenly the path leading to the 
house was there. Her uncle stopped the cart, and Mia leaped down with a 
delighted laugh.

&quot;Have a good day, Mia&quot;, her uncle called.

&quot;You too, Canje&quot;, Mia replied, waving her hand, and started down the 
path. She wanted to run, but she made herself walk the half mile past 
the couple of farms, listening to the sounds of the birds, smelling the 
scents in the breeze. She hoped Arine wouldn&#39;t be bothered by her coming 
so early.

Topping the last hill, she saw the house in the small valley. A bit of 
smoke was coming from the chimney. Her heart soared, and she had to take 
a deep breath before starting down the hillside. Stepping in front of 
the door, she smiled and took another deep breath, smiling at her own 
excitement. Before she could become too breathless she knocked at the 
door and stepped a bit back, closing her eyes.

After a while, the lock clacked and Arine opened the door. Her beautiful 
blue eyes widened in surprise at first, then she smiled, looking into 
Mia&#39;s eyes. Mia didn&#39;t know what she should say. &quot;Hi&quot; just wouldn&#39;t 
convey any of her feelings. She opened her mouth, but even had she had 
something to say, there wouldn&#39;t have been time to say it before the 
taller girl threw her arms around Mia and pulled her into a hug. Mia&#39;s 
hands wrapped around her friend&#39;s shoulders, burying in her blonde hair. 
Laying her head onto Arine&#39;s shoulder, she felt her emotions being 
expressed better than any words could do.

Hanging there for what felt like minutes, she let herself relax and 
forget everything else. She didn&#39;t need to say anything at all, didn&#39;t 
need to plan what to do. &quot;Hi&quot;, she murmured, smiling with contentment.

&quot;Hi, Mia.&quot; Arine&#39;s voice sounded as content as she felt.

After a while, Mia raised her head to look into Arine&#39;s eyes. She hadn&#39;t 
seen them this close before. Catching her breath, she had to pull 
herself a little further away to see Arine&#39;s whole face. A smiling, 
gentle, beautiful face. &quot;I&#39;m&quot;, Mia started, her voice sounding hoarse. 
Coughing, Mia tried again with a smile. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I came so early. This 
was the only ride I could get.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind&quot;, Arine replied. &quot;I don&#39;t need to work more today.&quot;

Mia looked at her friend, feeling troubled. &quot;Arine&quot;, she said, &quot;I don&#39;t 
want to be a bother. I can take a walk on the shore, or help you with 
your work, or make dinner for us. Really.&quot;

Mia blinked as Arine laid a finger on her lips to quiet her. &quot;You don&#39;t 
believe me, do you?&quot;, Arine said with a smile. Mia felt her face 
colouring. &quot;Come&quot;, Arine said. &quot;I&#39;ll show you.&quot;

Mia followed her inside, taking off her shoes. Arine took her to the 
work room. Large baskets of newly-dyed thread were stacked in a corner. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been hard-working these last few days&quot;, Arine said, smiling. She 
took Mia&#39;s hand and looked into her eyes. &quot;Would you like to pack a 
basket of food and go walking on the shore?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; Mia wanted to hug her friend again, but she made herself 
release Arine&#39;s hand and go to the stack of baskets. Picking up a ball 
of thread, she caressed it with her fingers. It was so soft. She pressed 
it to her chest, closing her eyes.

&quot;I haven&#39;t started with your thread yet. I&#39;ll get more nettle in a few 
days&quot;, Arine said with a smile.

&quot;There&#39;s no hurry,&quot; Mia murmured as set the thread back in the basket. 
&quot;I&#39;ll make a salad&quot;, she said to Arine as they walked into the kitchen.

             .......

Mia put the last of the sandwich into her mouth. Arine made some truly 
delicious bread. Mia looked sideways at her friend, sitting beside her 
on the hillside and gazing over the blue ocean to the horizon. She just 
liked everything about Arine. As she dusted the remaining crumbs from 
her hands, the small seashells clinked in her belt pouch. She was going 
to treasure the purple and white spiral shells Arine had picked for her. 
The food basket was nearly empty, and her stomach was full and as happy 
as herself. She lowered herself onto the warm sandstone, feeling the 
heat of the sun on her face. Shading her eyes, she looked at Arine as 
her friend turned to her.

&quot;Did you have enough? There&#39;s still a few sandwiches and cookies&quot;, Arine 
asked her.

Mia simply raised her hand to caress the small braid at Arine&#39;s temple. 
Arine smiled and laid down on the stone at Mia&#39;s side, closing her eyes. 
Mia&#39;s hand sought Arine&#39;s, and she squeezed it gently, closing her own 
eyes. The waves lapped, and the wind rustled the soft dry grass around 
them. She could lay here forever with Arine.

             .......

Blackbirds sang as the girls walked the path back to Arine&#39;s house. 
Mia&#39;s uncle would come around sunset, so they still had hours. Mia&#39;s 
voice felt tender from all the talking in the sea breeze, but Arine had 
promised her herb tea as soon as they got back. Mia shifted the basket 
to her other hand, so that she could grab Arine around the waist and hug 
her a little while they walked. Arine stumbled a bit in surprise, but 
smiled and put her hand around Mia&#39;s shoulder.

Inside, Arine filled a small kettle with water and lit a fire in the 
stove. Mia sat down beside the table, taking off her socks.

&quot;What would you like?&quot;, Arine asked.

&quot;The same as you&quot;, Mia said with a smile. Anything Arine liked would be 
delicious.

After a while, they were both sprawled happily on the sofa in Arine&#39;s 
living room. Mia scanned the large bookshelf. Arine loved reading. Mia 
hadn&#39;t read many books, but she wanted to read some of Arine&#39;s 
favourites some time. Arine had her head on the other end of the sofa, 
gazing into her tea mug on the floor, stirring the tea with a spoon.

&quot;Mia&quot;, Arine said, &quot;What are you doing tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;In the morning I ride with my uncle to the town, then we help a farmer 
friend with his apple trees&quot;, Mia said. Today had been so wonderful that 
she was having a hard time remembering her usual life.

Arine was silent for a long while. &quot;Really?&quot;, she finally said with a 
smile, still looking at the mug. &quot;Would you like to stay for the night?&quot;

Mia looked at her friend, feeling a wave of happiness in her body. Arine 
turned her head to look at her.

&quot;Yes&quot;, Mia said, her throat feeling a bit tight. Smiling, she rose so 
that she could get a better look at Arine. &quot;Why are you so kind to me, 
Arine?&quot;, she said with a smile. Her eyes stung.

Arine rose too, to sit right next to Mia. &quot;Because you&#39;re the best thing 
this spring has brought me&quot;, she murmured, looking into Mia&#39;s eyes, then 
grinned. &quot;Do you like to play cards? I&#39;ll teach you a few games I&#39;m sure 
you don&#39;t know&quot;, she said.

             .......

Mia&#39;s uncle came a bit before sunset, cheerfully agreeing to pick her up 
the next morning. After good night wishes he drove the cart back the 
path, singing a rhythmic tune. Mia turned to Arine, her face shining 
with excitement.

&quot;We can still catch the sunset&quot;, she said to Arine.

They shut the door and started down the path. After a few steps Mia took 
a look at Arine&#39;s face, and they both started running so that they could 
see as much of it as possible. Mia smiled as she ran. She didn&#39;t even 
need to say much to Arine for the other girl to understand what she was 
thinking.

They reached the top of a crest to see the magnificent view. Purple and 
orange clouds bathed in the last beams of sunlight, and the sea 
glittered. Birds wheeled high in the sky. The gentle inland breeze 
brought the scent of night flowers.

&quot;It&#39;s so beautiful&quot;, Mia said. &quot;I love the sea.&quot; As the sun set they 
stood there quietly, only occasionally pointing at a flock of birds or a 
cloud.

             .......

A few stars were already on the sky when they walked back to the house, 
talking in quiet voices. As Arine opened the door, Mia felt an 
undefineable happiness in her heart. Tonight, she could imagine she was 
living here with Arine.

They ate a little and brushed their teeth in candlelight. &quot;There are two 
bedrooms&quot;, Arine said. &quot;My aunt used to sleep in the other one, but you 
can use it, it&#39;s no problem&quot;, she said, looking at Mia reassuringly.

Mia looked at her feet, feeling uncertain. She noticed she was fumbling 
her bracelets, and stopped. Raising her eyes to look at Arine, who had a 
quizzical expression, Mia tried to encourage herself to open her mouth 
and say it.

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind...&quot;, she started, looking into Arine&#39;s eyes, finding 
encouragement in the kind deep blue. &quot;I want to sleep in the same room 
with you &quot; She blushed and lowered her eyes. &quot;If you don&#39;t-&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t&quot;, Arine said gently. &quot;The bed&#39;s big enough for both of us. I&#39;ll 
get you a pillow and a nightshirt.&quot; Mia looked at her friend&#39;s eyes 
again, smiling and blushing.

After a while Arine came back from the dressroom with a big pillow and a 
white linen shirt. &quot;Are you sleepy yet?&quot;, she asked Mia.

&quot;Just a little&quot;, Mia said. &quot;But I&#39;d like to go to bed and talk.&quot; She 
couldn&#39;t help her blushing, but it was as if no normal manners applied 
to the two of them, like there was nobody else to compare to. And there 
wasn&#39;t. There was no one else like Arine. She didn&#39;t feel at all strange 
at wanting to sleep in the same bed with her friend.

Taking the soft shirt, she followed Arine into the bedroom. On the wall 
near the sturdy bed was a small shelf with a dozen books, and a writing 
table was set in front of the window. Arine sat on the bed with a laugh, 
setting the other pillow on the bed. &quot;We can make it if you don&#39;t kick 
too much in your sleep&quot;, she said, grinning.

&quot;I&#39;ll try not to&quot;, Mia said with a giggle. She felt dreamy. The whole 
day had been like a fantasy. She wanted to forget everything but this 
day and Arine, to feel nothing but the warm and cozy happiness that 
filled every part of her body.

&quot;I&#39;ll go lock the door&quot;, Arine said as she rose. &quot;Do you need anything?&quot;

&quot;No&quot;, Mia replied. The bed looked soft and warm. She took off her 
blouse, shirt and bra and pulled the nightshirt over her head. It was 
soft and smelled nice. She unbuttoned her trousers and folded them 
neatly, setting the clothes on a small wicker basket in the corner.

Arine came back with a small glass of water, and set it beside the bed. 
&quot;You took a head start&quot;, she said to Mia, &quot;But I&#39;ll let it pass since 
you are a guest. Which side do you want?&quot;

&quot;The wall&quot;, Mia said without hesitation. She hadn&#39;t even thought about 
it, but given the question, she knew she wanted to be between Arine and 
the wall. She lifted the thick blanket and slipped under it. The bed was 
as soft and comfortable as it looked, and it smelled of Arine. She 
turned and lay her head on the pillow, watching her friend unbutton her 
shirt. Arine laid the shirt on the table and unfastened the clasp of her 
bra.

Arine glanced at Mia. &quot;Hey, that&#39;s unfair&quot;, she exclaimed. &quot;You think 
you can just lie there covered and watch while I undress?&quot;, she said.

&quot;Yes&quot;, Mia said, smiling sweetly.

Arine frowned at her. &quot;I&#39;ll get you back, you know&quot;, she said and took 
off the bra, smiling. Mia let her eyes wander over Arine&#39;s shoulders and 
arms she had never seen before, her slim waist and her pretty breasts. 
She was beautiful.

&quot;That&#39;s enough&quot;, Arine told her, putting on her nightshirt. She loosened 
her trousers and tossed them onto the table, then sat on the bed next to 
Mia. &quot;You really are going to sleep there, are you?&quot;, she asked with a 
fond smile.

&quot;If you&#39;ll let me&quot;, Mia replied, snuggling the pillow.

&quot;You&#39;re so cute that I couldn&#39;t throw you out&quot;, Arine said as she slid 
under the blanket with Mia. There was less room than Mia had thought, 
but she wouldn&#39;t have loosened from the bed for anything. She looked 
into Arine&#39;s eyes. Today had been the best day of her life. She didn&#39;t 
know what exactly she felt for this beautiful yellow-haired girl. Friend 
just didn&#39;t begin to describe this feeling of understanding and 
affection. Not a sister. Not a lover. She didn&#39;t care. This feeling, 
this day was all that mattered, and she wouldn&#39;t be bothered by what 
anybody would have thought about her lying in bed with Arine.

&quot;I&#39;m happy with you&quot;, she said.

&quot;Me too&quot;, Arine said. Even though Mia had said she&#39;d like to talk in 
bed, she felt like just lying there and falling into sweet sleep beside 
her friend. Arine seemed to enjoy just looking at her, too. After a long 
while Arine said, &quot;I&#39;ll put the candle out.&quot;

&quot;Mm.&quot; Mia was already feeling half asleep, but she felt a content smile 
on her face. Arine turned to snuff the candle on the small table beside 
the bed, then snuggled back under the sheet. The starlight from the 
window made her face faintly visible, though night vision was already 
making her features more clear. Mia took Arine&#39;s hand in hers. &quot;Good 
night, Arine&quot;, she murmured, smiling.

&quot;Good night, Mia&quot;, Arine said, her voice sounding sleepy too. Closing 
her eyes, Mia let the memories of the day softly flow in her mind. Her 
hand still in Arine&#39;s, sleep soon took her.</pre>
