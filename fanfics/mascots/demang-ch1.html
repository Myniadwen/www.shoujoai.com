<pre>Are they friends? Or more than that....

&quot;This is so boring, there is absolutely nothing to do,&quot; thought Arine as 
she strolled along the sidewalk of the quiet little town she lived in. 
She usually helped people in one of the many street shops or read from 
her extensive collection of books at home, but today no one seemed to 
need any help, and the bookstore was closed. She aimlessly walked along 
not really knowing where she was going, to engrossed in her own thoughts 
to really care.

She slowly made here way out of the seaside village and into the 
surrounding woods. &quot;What to do?&quot; she thought, she never really was 
interested in boys, the bookstore was closed and she was out of new 
things to read. Not only that but her parents where gone for a week, she 
really never knew why, but she was used to being on her own anyway. She 
slowly came to a stop and became aware of the fact she had no clue where 
she was. &quot;Damn it, now where am I.&quot; She looked around and saw a tree she 
could climb. &quot;If I could climb that I can see where I am.&quot;

Climbing trees wasn&#39;t a new venture for Arine; she had climbed hundreds 
when she was younger. However, she was glad that no one was underneath 
her for the soul purpose she was wearing a skirt. She got to the top and 
got the idea of where east was, her little town a blur from the suns 
heat beating off of the roofs. Suddenly something caught her eye. 
Straight up from here a purple blur appeared from nowhere, &quot;What in the 
world is...&quot; A shape falling towards her yelling &quot;shiiiiiiit&quot; cut her 
off.

The next thing Arine knew was is that she was on the ground, the wind 
knocked out of her, and something heavy laying on top of her. She 
wiggled out and looked down, it was a girl. She had beautiful Brunette 
colored hair, not only her hair was beautiful, but so was she. 
&quot;Aaaaammm,&quot; mumbled Arine as she turned away, catching herself looking 
at the girl&#39;s breast for some reason. Suddenly the girl started to move 
slightly, she sat up and opened her eyes and looked around for a second.

She looked up at Arine and got a surprised look on her face, at the same 
time locks of her hair fell back exposing her strongly pointed ears. 
Both girls screamed simultaneously and ran away; not realizing the other 
was running away. &quot;What! A demon, ho...How did she get here, how did 
this happen.&quot; She looked around the tree slightly to see the other girl 
looking at her duck suddenly; Arine realized she was afraid of her. &quot;But 
why would she be afraid of me, I should be afraid of her.&quot; Arine slowly 
stepped out from behind the tree, &quot;Who are you?&quot; she quietly said, 
careful not to sound mean. No answer, so she said a little louder &quot;Who 
are you?&quot;

&quot;Who are you to ask for my name, Angel,&quot; said the girl with an element 
of arrogance and fright. 

&quot;Are you afraid of me?&quot; asked Arine. 

&quot;What! Of curse I&#39;m not afraid of a stupid Angel&quot; she said, still with 
that element of fright. 

&quot;Haha,&quot; giggled Arine, &quot;than why are you still hiding behind that tree?&quot;

The girl stepped out from behind the tree with a determined look on her 
face. She reminded Arine of a kind of little sister person, someone who 
is shy and flighty but tries to hid it. She seemed to have a good bit of 
energy in her though. Arine grinned.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny, Angel?&quot; 

&quot;Angel, Angel, I have a name you know.&quot; 

&quot;So, I don&#39;t know it, so to me your &quot;Angel,&quot; nothing more, nothing 
less.&quot; 

&quot;Good point,&quot; she said, &quot;My names Arine.&quot; 

&quot;So, why should I care Arine?&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you, why are you so snotty, or is it just me?&quot; 

&quot;What kind of stupid question is that, you&#39;re an angel and I&#39;m a demon, 
where not supposed to be friends.&quot; 

&quot;Says who?&quot; said Arine. 

&quot;I...I don&#39;t know, well I guess you&#39;re right, I don&#39;t see why we can&#39;t 
be friends, that is if you help me find my way back, but I warn you, any 
funny business and you&#39;ll see the kind of power an demon has. Anyhow my 
names Mia&quot; 

They started slowly walking down the path. Arine told Mia about the 
little village where they where going, what she did most of the day, and 
some of her history. Mia seemed real evasive about her past. As they 
where walking along, all of the sudden the ground cracked in a weak part 
of the path. With a deep &quot;crack&quot; sound Mia fell in, managing to grab a 
root as she fell. Arine grabbed her arm and pulled yelling, &quot;Don&#39;t let 
go!&quot;

&quot;Does it look like I plan on it!&quot; was Mia&#39;s reply. With one strong tug 
from both of them they both flew out of the hole. They landed with Mia 
on top. They both sat there panting for a few seconds before they seemed 
to realize that Mia&#39;s leg was in between Arine&#39;s, and their breast where 
mashing together. They looked at each other blushing, their faces not 
but five inches away. Mia stood up and quickly said thanks. Arine got up 
shortly afterwards and asked Mia if she was okay, a nod was all she got 
in return.

They slowly continued down the path, not saying much after falling on 
each other like that. Just before they got to the outskirts of town 
Arine stopped. &quot;Okay, we need to find some why to get you to my house 
without your ears showing. I know.&quot; She took off her skirt tie and 
loosely rapped it around Mia&#39;s head, covering her ears, making it look 
like a hood. Her skirt threatened to fall off now she was sure she could 
make it home, and the cover looked completely natural. &quot;This is kind of 
stupid, I feel like a fool,&quot; said Mia. &quot;Oh stop complaining, you look 
cute.&quot; &quot;Ok, now if anyone asks, you&#39;re my friend Amy from the next town 
alright?&quot; &quot;Got ya.&quot;

They walked in as casually as possible, sticking to the alleys as not to 
attract attention. They got about halfway to Arine&#39;s house when they 
where stopped by the book store owner, &quot;Arine, where have you been, I 
thought you where going to stop by latter.&quot; 

&quot;I was, but I got a little sidetracked, sorry.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s ok, so who&#39;s your friend here.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, this is Amy, she&#39;s a friend from the city to the north.&quot; 

&quot;Another city, I didn&#39;t know you had friends outside of town.&quot; 

&quot;Well what do you expect; to know everything about my personal life?&quot; 

&quot;I guess not, well see you latter.&quot; 

&quot;Bye.&quot; 

&quot;Phew, that was kind of close, that was the bookstore owner, a nice guy, 
but a little nosey from time to time.&quot; 

&quot;A little my foot,&quot; snickered Mia.

Soon they finally made it to Arine&#39;s house, a little white stone 
building with a wood roof, about a hundred yards from the beach. As they 
walked around inside Mia stopped. 

&quot;Kind of quaint for an angel but nice none the less.&quot; 

&quot;What, do you think, we all live in extravagant castles. Ha, not all of 
us angels are so lucky as to be born with servants willing to scrub our 
feet an our very whim.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know much about this world.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize. It&#39;s to be expected for a demon not to know much about 
angel&#39;s worlds, and I shouldn&#39;t have snapped back at you like that. I 
guess I&#39;m a little tired. Now you make yourself at home, get something 
to eat or something like that. I&#39;ll be upstairs trying to figure out how 
you got here.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks, say do you have a place where I can take a bath.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, just down that hall there.&quot;

Arine went upstairs to consult any books she had on magic or spells, 
more specifically teleportation type spells. Meanwhile Mia got into the 
bath to cool down and contemplate her situation, mainly the fall she had 
on top of Arine. At this point Mia was beginning to think of another 
possibility of why that felt good, &quot;What is wrong with me? For some 
reason I&#39;m attracted to her, but why? I still can&#39;t figure out why 
landing on her didn&#39;t feel as wrong as it should have.&quot;

Arine was looking up in her books to intently to think about anything 
other than what she was reading, &quot;I don&#39;t get it, I&#39;ve never heard of a 
spell like that one. I never did tell her that teleportation, or at 
least the ones angels sometimes use, can&#39;t move living things. If it had 
been anything like ours he would have been diced into cubes of condensed 
matter. Normally angels would use magic to reassemble inanimate objects 
but living things die when this process occurs. Hmm, I just don&#39;t get 
it. I could ask someone who is skilled in magic, but who, and not only 
that but if I asked them they would want to know why and I would have to 
introduce Mia. People skilled in magic would sense she was a demon.&quot;

&quot;You know, you really shouldn&#39;t talk to yourself like that, it&#39;s not a 
good sign.&quot; 

&quot;Sign of what, dare I ask?&quot; said Arine, still not turning away from the 
book in front of her. 

&quot;So besides what you said out loud, what did you find out?&quot; Mia said 
leaning over Arine&#39;s chair to see the book she was reading. 

&quot;A... I...found...&quot; Arine stuttered, distracted by Mia&#39;s boobs pushing 
up against her back, &quot;I really haven&#39;t found anything yet, I need some 
more time.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s ok, you said your parents where out of town for a week or so. I 
might just stay for a while.&quot; 

&quot;Wait a second, you can&#39;t just...&quot; she stopped herself before she said 
what she meant to, knowing it was impossible for the demon to stay 
elsewhere. 

&quot;You feel it to, don&#39;t you? That feeling I&#39;ve had since we meet, you&#39;ve 
got it too.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, I know exactly what you&#39;re talking about. That feeling of 
foreboding, that something terrible is going to happen. I don&#39;t know why 
but when you&#39;re around that feeling seems to lessen, but I only got it 
once I met you in the first place, I think we need to be very careful 
from now on.&quot;

Mia was sure of it now, what she felt deep in her gut was a bad feeling. 
A feeling of what could happen, and that something soon must be avoided, 
what it was though she had no idea.

&quot;Well to get off that depressing subject, where am I going to sleep.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know, I think I should show you the house then you can decide 
for yourself.&quot;

Arine showed Mia around the house, each room. Finally they came to one 
that when Mia stepped into she stopped for a second, looking around with 
a puzzled look on her face.

&quot;This room feels different from the rest, very different, but in a good 
way. It feels like its been lived in more than the rest of the house. 
Its got a nice feeling to it, I think I will sleep in here if you don&#39;t 
mind, look there&#39;s even a bed all ready for me.&quot; said Mia with a grin on 
her face. 

&quot;Odd that you should pick my room, I&#39;ll get my cot and sleep on it. 
Since you&#39;re the guest you should get the bed.&quot; bluntly put Arine. 

&quot;This is your room! Well that explains a lot, but that&#39;s okay I&#39;ll sleep 
on the cot.&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure, that cot sleeps like a rock.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s okay I need a firm bed anyhow,&quot; retorted Mia. 

&quot;It&#39;s starting to get dark anyways, I&#39;ll go get our stuff,&quot; said Arine, 
letting Mia have her way.

Arine got into the closet across the hall and pulled out the cot, 
setting it up in the middle of the room. After putting a blanket and 
pillow on it she went to the drawer. Mia examined the cot and sat on it. 
&quot;Well this is a terrible bed, and Arine was going to sleep here instead 
of on her bed. How nice of her to do that for me.&quot; 

&quot;So Arine why are your parents always gone.&quot; 

&quot;Well to tell you the truth, I never really know why. They&#39;re both very 
skilled in magic and are hired for help, usually construction or things 
like that. Not only that but I usually don&#39;t know when they&#39;re going to 
be back, but don&#39;t worry I know it won&#39;t be any time soon.&quot; 

&quot;So you&#39;re parents are magic users huh. Do you know any spells?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, a few. I can heal small wounds. Move anything but magi cite as 
long as it&#39;s not heaver than my body, and I can use some weak wind 
attack spells. The healing spells and movement spells I learned on my 
own, but the attack spells where taught to me incase I ever needed to 
defend myself. In these peaceful times I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever need them 
though,&quot; explained Arine. 

&quot;Wow! You&#39;ll have to show me what you can do tomorrow. I&#39;m curious how 
magic works since demons can&#39;t use it. The only ability that I know we 
have over you Angel&#39;s is that we can take more pain and we are 
physically stronger.&quot; 

&quot;Well, anyway here is your night shirt, its clean,&quot; Arine said as she 
handed over the shirt to Mia. 

&quot;Its clean huh, I don&#39;t really care unless it&#39;s caked in mud. It&#39;s not 
like I have to eat off of it, you know what I mean.&quot;

Arine got out of her shirt exposing her breast but facing away from Mia. 
Once she got hers on, Mia changed into hers, not bothering to turn away, 
curious to see if Arine would look. She did.

&quot;Now you owe me.&quot; Mia stated. 

Arine blushed heavily as she realized Mia had seen her staring. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean--,&quot; she was cut of by Mia shaking her head. 

&quot;Don&#39;t think anything of it Arine,&quot; said Mia.

They both lay down, waiting for sleep to embrace them into its 
comforting grip. Arine fell asleep facing Mia with a peaceful look on 
her face. Mia just watched her for several long minutes, admiring the 
carefree life she led, and thinking how lucky she was to meet this 
wonderful woman. Sleep soon engulfed her.

Mia&#39;s dreams where troubled that night. &quot;Haha,&quot; laughed a hideous voice, 
&quot;Tod zur Lesbierin,&quot; it growled. Mia recognized the voice, &quot;When will 
you leave me to my own life, Father!&quot; she shouted back at the large dark 
figure in front of her. &quot;Hahaha,&quot; he laughed again. Mia was standing 
alone on a dried charred plain; the sky was red and heavy with smoke, 
making it hard to breath. The figure raised its hand above its head, a 
fireball about the size of a basketball forming at his fingertips. He 
menacingly pointed the fire at Mia and yelled &quot;Feur frei!!!&quot; The 
fireball shot out of his hand with devastating speed. Mia was frozen 
with fear, but suddenly another figure stepped in front of her. &quot;Watch 
out Mia!&quot; yelled a familiar voice; it was Arine. She moved her hands in 
a complicated but graceful way then put one out towards the approaching 
attack, palm open. &quot;Winden Sie Blatt,&quot; she yelled, a powerful gust of 
wind shot from her outstretched hand. The gale hit the fireball about 50 
feet away and stopped it dead in its tracks.

At first it seemed Arine would be able to hold off the attack but the 
fireball once again started to gain distance. As it got about 20 feet 
away Arine screamed, then yelled, &quot;Mia he is to strong, run, get out of 
here.&quot; What can she do, here was her best friend trying to hold off her 
father, one of the most powerful demons known. Just as the fireball got 
to Arine, Mia woke up and sat up in her bed gasping for breath in a cold 
sweat. &quot;What was that? I&#39;ve never had a dream like that before.&quot; After a 
second she caught a shiver, it was freezing. She looked around to see if 
Arine was still in her bed, sighing in relief when she saw that Arine 
was sleeping safe and sound.

Mia tried to go back to sleep, but was still in shock from the vivid 
dream. &quot;Could that have been foresight, I hope not. It could be 
connected to the feeling I&#39;ve had lately, but why would my father come 
after me after he went through all the trouble of sending me here in the 
first place.&quot; It was hopeless she couldn&#39;t fall asleep feeling alone and 
scared like she was now. She looked over at Arine again. She got up and 
walked over to her.

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to get involved with my problems, but I don&#39;t want to 
leave either,&quot; she quietly said.

She noticed that there was a good two feet of free space on the bed, 
then looked back an Arine. &quot;I don&#39;t think you would mind, would you?&quot; 
She softly sat on the bed and slowly slipped under the covers, careful 
not to disturb Arine. Snuggling up to the angel she felt somehow relived 
from her troubles. Like she could just lay there and forget everything 
bad. &quot;Is this the &quot;air of tranquility&quot; that is said to follow angels 
around, or is it just the affect Arine has one me?&quot; Mia wondered as she 
once again fell into a deep sleep, this time without the troubles of 
nightmares.

End of Chapter 1

____________________Authors notes Feur frei is German for &quot;open fire&quot; or 
&quot;fire freely.&quot; Tod zur Lesbierin is German for &quot;death to the lesbian.&quot; 
&quot;Winden Sie Blatt&quot; is German for &quot;Wind Blade.&quot; The &quot;Air of Tranquility&quot; 
that Mia speaks about it the popular belief (in her world) that a 
troubled mind can be calmed by the known presence of a nearby angel. 

The reason I used German is because it&#39;s the only language I can halfway 
understand, also my language translator helps.
