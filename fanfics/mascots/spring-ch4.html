<h1>Spring (part 4 of 6)</h1>

<a href="../mascots/spring-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Birds twittered outside the window. Arine tossed aside the blanket and 
got up, still yawning as she changed into her day clothes. Judging by 
the clouds, it was going to be a wonderfully sunny day agin. She smiled 
and whistled, already planning her work in her mind.

After a good breakfast she sat in front of the spinning wheel, humming a 
cheerful tune, and took a basket of wool. She tapped her other foot 
while working, producing the fine thread at a good pace.

She had done it, hadn&#39;t she?

She could remember all of it. Squirming under the sheets in pleasure, 
touching every part of Mia in her mind. Dreaming of holding on to Mia&#39;s 
beautiful shoulders while the dark-eyed girl gently took her.

She grimaced. She had really thought it a good idea at the time. Maybe 
it had been. It was not like she would just forget something like that 
in an instant. Today, when they went walking, she could laugh and run 
with Mia, to feel the real Mia again. The confusion would pass. That she 
could enjoy the thought of making love to her just went to show the 
deepness of her affection for the girl. What was true was their 
friendship and affection, and that was what she wanted to have, not 
steamy nights of passion. She sighed in exasperation. She knew she was a 
pensive person, but this was ridiculous. She should walk to Falow and 
back with a backpack full of rocks, and see if she&#39;d get better sleep 
next night without this kind of desire-filled ventures into the depths 
of her imagination.

             .......

From the sound of the knock she knew it was Mia. Smiling, she opened the 
door to the sight of her friend in a beautiful layered white shirt and 
brown shorts. Thin bracelets, green and yellow today, jingled on the 
girl&#39;s wrists as she raised her arms to hug Arine. Arine squeezed her 
tightly, producing a delighted squeak of surprise, then released her and 
looked into her eyes.

&quot;You&#39;ve put some sort of spell on me&quot;, Arine said accusingly. &quot;I always 
knew there was something with you A&eacute;ann.&quot;

Mia giggled as she set her shoulder bag on the floor. &quot;Damn&quot;, she said 
mischievously. &quot;It was supposed to be totally unnoticeable. How did you 
find out?&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe the thoughts I&#39;m getting when I think of you&quot;, 
Arine told her earnestly.

&quot;Try me&quot;, the dark-eyed girl said, her eyes glittering with delight.

&quot;Not a chance&quot;, Arine said as she took a sip from the mug she had been 
carrying when Mia knocked.

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not fair&quot;, Mia exclaimed, then peered into Arine&#39;s eyes, 
examining them with mock seriousness. Her lips curved into a teasing 
smile. &quot;Something naughty?&quot;

Arine choked, splattering tea on the front of her shirt. Coughing, she 
set the mug on the table and wiped her mouth. &quot;Idiot&quot;, she said, then 
grabbed the laughing dark-haired girl around the waist and held her 
close to whisper in her ear.

&quot;You had better not try anything of the sort&quot;, the said to the giggling 
Mia who was vainly trying to free herself, &quot;because if I fall for you, I 
won&#39;t let you off lightly.&quot;

Mia&#39;s struggling subsided as she realized she was not going to escape 
Arine&#39;s grip. &quot;I&#39;ll have to be careful then&quot;, she said, her eyes shining 
merrily, still giggling.

Arine considered tickling the girl till she rolled on the floor begging 
for mercy. Instead she loosened her arms from around Mia and picked up 
her mug. &quot;Just so whe got that clear.&quot; She watched Mia as the girl 
started unpacking foods from the shoulder bag, feeling a bit 
heavy-hearted.

How would Mia feel if she knew everything Arine had done to her in her 
imagination last night? She had never seen her friend sad. Seeing Mia 
with tears in her beautiful dark eyes, silently looking at Arine in 
hurt, would break her heart. She felt like crying, just imagining Mia so 
injured. But she didn&#39;t know what Mia would think. This girl was so 
special, so kind, that she might just blush fiercely and give a shy but 
delighted smile at the intimate compliment.

The thought warmed Arine&#39;s mind. It felt like something Mia would do. 
Not that she could ever think of telling her. But she felt better, and 
Mia&#39;s warm presence soothed her. She walked to the workroom, then came 
back with a bundle. Mia was packing sandwiches into the basket, laying 
them side by side tightly enough to prevent them from moving around. 
Arine walked behind her, smiling with anticipation.

&quot;Mia,&quot; she said gently. She loved the sound of her name.

The dark-eyed girl turned around with a surprised look, sensing 
something in the voice. She looked at Arine&#39;s eyes, then noticed the 
bundle and gave a sound of delight.

Arine gave her the six rolls of fine thread, soft and reddish brown. 
Mia&#39;s eyes shone with happiness as she took the rolls and pressed them 
to her bosom, laying her cheek on them.

&quot;So soft&quot;, she murmured, then looked up at Arine affectionately. &quot;Thank 
you.&quot;

&quot;My pleasure&quot;, Arine said, smiling at the adorable girl. &quot;But if you 
even mention paying, I swear I&#39;ll throw you into the sea with your 
clothes on.&quot;

             .......

The crashing waves sprayed a fine mist on the girls as they walked on 
the shore. Mia twirled the basket in her hands, laughing as the tiny 
drops of salt water landed on her cheeks. The sun would dry it off in no 
time, and they were planning to go swimming anyway. Arine looked at her 
friend walking barefoot in the sand, the water rising to her ankles with 
each wave. She felt her worries fade away with the wet breeze, laughing 
almost as much as Mia.

Arriving at a point where a sandy path led between and up the hills they 
left the waterline, heading for one of their favourite spots. Higher up, 
crickets chirped in the patches of grass dotting the sand dunes. Short 
vague trails, barely noticeable, of their earlier footprints were still 
visible in places. Small pines grew in copses on the hilltops and dunes 
along the shore. Inland, larger forests alternated with fields and the 
occasional farmhouse. A magnificent view of the ocean opened from a 
large grassy dune, with a stand of trees near the top offering shade 
from the beating sun. Mia exclaimed in delight at the sight of the cool 
shade and darted into a run, her shining white shirt flowing with the 
wind. Arine laughed and broke into a run too, determined to reach the 
spot before her barefoot friend.

They reached the shade together, Mia panting from running in the sand 
with the heavy basket. She set it down and half fell on the soft sand, 
wiping sweat from her brow and grinning, then dug a water bottle from 
the basket. She took a deep drink and offered the bottle to Arine, who 
took it gratefully. After quenching her thirst, Arine set the bottle in 
the sand and glanced at her friend. Mia was looking across the dunes to 
the blue shimmering ocean with a content smile, her breathing already 
slowing to normal. She was becoming as proficient as Arine herself at 
gazing into the horizon for minutes on end. Arine smiled fondly and lay 
down on the warm sand, watching the pine braches above her gently wave 
in the breeze, relaxing every part of her body. After a while, she 
turned her eyes back to Mia. To the dark soft hair curling slightly 
around her adorable ears. Her slim neck and enticing shoulders, bared by 
the thin layered shirt. Her lips that looked as beautiful when she was 
serious as when she smiled. Her delicate chin and pretty nose. Her 
lovely eyes, such an enchanting deep brown that she would never forget 
the time when she first looked into them.

The truth was, she couldn&#39;t imagine ever finding somebody that she would 
love as much as she loved Mia. How could anyone compare to this 
adorable, kind and gentle girl, who cared for Arine just as much she she 
did for her?

But that didn&#39;t matter right now. She was happy enough to have a friend 
like Mia. She felt that last night had been a good idea after all, 
because now it didn&#39;t feel like some suppressed desire, just a fun 
little play of imagination. She blushed. It had been a bit too fun, and 
more than a little foolish. But looking at Mia, she didn&#39;t feel the same 
tension as yesterday, so it must have been for the good. She wanted to 
laugh and play with Mia, not kiss her. Seeing her nude again would be 
fun, but not too much fun like last time. She chuckled. Besides, she 
could want to hug and embrace Mia as much as she wanted. That need not 
be confused with romance. She stirred, lifting herself to move closer to 
Mia, and laid her head in Mia&#39;s lap. The dark-haired girl looked down in 
surprise, then gently stroked Arine&#39;s yellow hair.

&quot;Do you feel like taking a nap?&quot;, she asked Arine.

In the warm comfort of Mia&#39;s thighs, feeling the soft caress on her 
hair, Arine did.

Mia started singing a soft lullaby. Arine closed her eyes and curled up 
her legs, smiling as she relaxed. She had Mia right here and didn&#39;t need 
anything more. Her hand took a gentle grip on Mia&#39;s shorts as she let 
the beautiful voice carry her away.
