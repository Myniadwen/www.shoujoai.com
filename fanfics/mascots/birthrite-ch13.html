Mia and Arine held their arms in front of their faces to shield their 
eyes from the blinding white light being emanated from the diamond. As 
Johan fired the blast of mystical energy that he had been building in 
the form of a beam of magenta light, the power of the diamond seemed to 
collapse upon itself, and then exploded like a supernova. The wave of 
mystical energy from the diamond collided with the energy that Johan had 
fired, throwing it back at him. Johan cried out in pain as his body was 
hit with his own mystical energies, throwing him over to the roof of the 
next building over. As the white light faded, Mia and Arine observed the 
scene. Johan was unconscious two buildings over, both the Ruby and the 
Sapphire were lying on the roof that Johan had just been thrown from, 
and lying on the ground before the two girls was Mia&#39;s diamond earring 
alone.

&quot;Pierre,&quot; Mia choked. &quot;He...He sacrificed himself to save us.&quot;

Arine said with the same sadness that Mia felt, &quot;Diamond was the only 
crystal that could have protected us from Johan. And the only diamond 
that Pierre had available was your earring.&quot; Arine and Mia looked at 
their ground, their tears falling to the cement of the roof.

----------

As the surrounding mystical energies returned to normal, the Jewel 
Summoners came out of their disorientation and regained their balance. 
&quot;Is everyone all right?&quot; asked Alana.

Her subjects responded, &quot;Yes, Lady Alana,&quot; or &quot;Yes, Milady.&quot;

As the Jewel Summoners&#39; daze continued to lift, Giovanni regained his 
senses enough to wonder, &quot;What was that?&quot;

&quot;It was more powerful than any corundum I&#39;ve ever sensed,&quot; mentioned 
Fredrika.

Unlike the other Jewel Summoners, Felix was much more sad than he was 
confused. &quot;I believe...&quot; he said, &quot;...that it was diamond.&quot;

The other Jewel Summoners looked at Felix with a combination of 
incredulity, amazement, and fear. &quot;Are you sure, Lord Felix?&quot; asked 
Alana.

&quot;It&#39;s the only thing that could have produced a force powerful enough to 
disorient every Jewel Summoner in the area,&quot; Fredrika agreed

&quot;Lord Pierre must have had some with him...&quot; said Felix, ...&quot;and used it 
to protect Arine and Mia.&quot;

&quot;Lord Pierre,&quot; Alana said, as if speaking to her fallen comrade, &quot;I hope 
what you have done was for the best.&quot;

The Clan Leaders spent a moment in silence to mourn. After their moment 
of silence, the Clan Leaders continued moving their subjects to the 
elevators to help Arine and Mia.

----------

Mia walked to where Pierre stood before he had disappeared. She picked 
up the diamond earring at her feet and examined it with tearful eyes. 
&quot;All that power...&quot; said the brunette, &quot;...from one little diamond.&quot;

However, Mia and Arine&#39;s moment for mourning was short-lived as Arine 
noticed Johan&#39;s fingers start twitching. &quot;Mia!&quot; she called. &quot;Johan is 
coming to!&quot;

Mia looked at Johan to see that although he was not yet conscious, Johan 
was indeed stirring. &quot;What are we going to do?&quot; she wondered.

In her injured state, Arine was unable to do what needed to be done. She 
said to Mia, &quot;You have to get over there. Get both the Ruby and the 
Sapphire.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t get over there fast enough,&quot; said Mia. &quot;The only way to get 
there before Johan is to fly.&quot;

As Mia spoke, an idea came into Arine&#39;s mind. &quot;Then fly,&quot; she said.

&quot;What?&quot; asked a confused Mia.

&quot;Run as fast as you can toward Alvara&#39;s crystals,&quot; the blonde 
instructed. &quot;Even without the power of corundum, I think my telekinesis 
is still powerful enough to bring you the rest of the way to that 
building.&quot;

&quot;Run?&quot; said Mia. &quot;I don&#39;t think I can. Not without overworking my 
heart.&quot;

&quot;I think I can give you enough strength for one short dash,&quot; Arine said. 
&quot;Mia, it&#39;s the only way.&quot;

Knowing that Johan would regain consciousness any second, Mia knew that 
she had no choice but to do what Arine suggested. She backed up until 
she was standing next to the blonde. She took a sprinter&#39;s stance and 
then looked at Arine one more time. &quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; the 
brunette asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Arine encouraged. Arine and Mia reached for each other and 
held hands for a moment. Their hair sparkled as Arine used her gene of 
biological vigor to give strength to her girlfriend. Mia felt a surge of 
energy as she held Arine&#39;s hand. &quot;Now fly,&quot; said Arine. &quot;Fly!&quot;

Utilizing all of the strength that Arine had passed to her, Mia made a 
mad dash toward the other end of the roof, toward the building that the 
Ruby and the Sapphire were lying on. As she reached the edge of the 
roof, Mia jumped across the alley toward the next building over. Arine 
reached toward Mia, using her elfin powers to the best of her abilities, 
attempting to keep Mia airborne until she reached the next building.

However, Arine&#39;s telekinesis was not powerful enough to get Mia all the 
way to the next building. Mia started falling, but managed to grab the 
ledge of the roof before she fell to the pavement below. Mia pulled 
herself up to where she could see Alvara&#39;s crystals lying in front of 
her. She could also see Johan lying on the next building over, slowly 
opening his eyes. Mia struggled to get up to the roof in reach of the 
Ruby and the Sapphire.

Johan stood up and saw that Mia was reaching for the crystals. Overcome 
by the urge to get to the crystals before anyone else, Johan ran toward 
the building that Mia was hanging onto and jumped to the building.

Then, just as Johan dove for the crystals, a memory stirred inside Mia. 
It was extremely vague, but Mia somehow remembered reaching toward a red 
jewel just like she was doing now. As the memory flashed inside Mia&#39;s 
mind, the Ruby moved out of Johan&#39;s reach toward Mia&#39;s outstretched arm! 
The Ruby flew toward Mia, but Johan used the power of the Sapphire 
against her. A force both threw the Ruby away from Mia and knocked Mia 
over the edge of the building. At seeing his niece fall, Johan suddenly 
realized, &quot;Mia! What have I done?&quot; Johan ran to the edge of the roof and 
aimed the Sapphire at the falling brunette before him. He used the power 
of the Sapphire to slow Mia&#39;s descent and then pull her back up to him. 
&quot;Are you all right, Mia-chan?&quot; he asked Mia as he held her in his arms.

&quot;You almost killed me,&quot; said Mia. &quot;Don&#39;t call me Mia-chan!&quot; Her anger 
building, Mia attempted to kick Johan in the groin. However, his 
foresight alerting him to the danger, Johan jumped over Mia before her 
foot made contact. Still holding on to Mia from behind his back, Johan 
threw the brunette over his head, back to the roof of the bakery, where 
Arine was lying.

&quot;Mia!&quot; cried Arine as Mia lay beside her, unconscious.

As Arine put her hand to Mia&#39;s neck to feel her pulse, she saw the Jewel 
Summoners rise to the roof on their spinel vehicles. &quot;How is she, 
Arine?&quot; asked Lady Fredrika.

&quot;She&#39;s alive,&quot; said Arine at feeling a slight pulse. &quot;But I don&#39;t think 
she has much left in her.&quot; The blonde looked back at Johan, who was 
looking at his hands, horrified by what he had done. &quot;Look at what your 
elfin powers have done to you, Johan,&quot; Arine called to him. &quot;You&#39;re 
finding it difficult to know friend from foe. Your powers are struggling 
to break free from the confines of your body, and you can&#39;t contain 
them.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me what I can and cannot do with my powers!&quot; Johan spat. 
However, his expression suddenly changed from one of anger to one of 
confusion. &quot;What did I just say?&quot; he asked himself.

Arine saw that the Ruby had not fallen to the pavement below, but had 
landed at the far end of the roof. She turned to the Jewel Summoners and 
said, &quot;I can&#39;t get to the Red Ruby of Alvara. I need someone to bring it 
here to me. I need its power to help Mia.&quot;

&quot;Lord Sven!&quot; said Fredrika to the Jewel Summoner that was closest to the 
Ruby.

The elderly Jewel Summoner took out a spinel crystal and aimed it toward 
the Ruby. The spinel crystal glowed red, and it seemed as if the crystal 
extended itself toward the Ruby, taking the shape of an arm and a hand. 
As the glowing red hand picked up the Ruby, Johan fired a blast of 
energy from the Sapphire at Sven. The blast hit the spinel hand, 
shattering the spinel arm and Sven&#39;s spinel crystal. However, the blast 
also threw the Ruby toward Sven, who caught the red jewel and threw it 
to Arine.

Arine held the Ruby over Mia&#39;s body and held Mia&#39;s hand. As the Ruby 
glowed red, Arine&#39;s elfin powers increased and her hair started 
sparkling. &quot;Hang in there, Mia,&quot; the blonde pleaded with her unconscious 
girlfriend.

&quot;Hey, Arine,&quot; a young male voice said from in front of her. Arine looked 
to see Sam ascending on a spinel vehicle that was being piloted by 
David. The boy was holding an amethyst crystal in his hand. &quot;Need a 
hand?&quot; Sam asked.

&quot;Please,&quot; Arine cried. Sam jumped off of the vehicle onto the roof and 
ran to Mia. He held the amethyst crystal over Mia&#39;s body and it started 
glowing purple. With the healing powers of the elf and the healing 
powers of quartz, Mia&#39;s hair began sparkling just like Arine&#39;s.

As Arine and Sam were preoccupied helping Mia, the other Jewel Summoners 
advanced on Johan to keep him from getting to the Ruby. &quot;Please! Stay 
back!&quot; Johan cried. &quot;I can&#39;t control...&quot; Johan trailed off, his powers 
controlling him to attack his opponents. Johan started firing attacks 
from the Sapphire at the Jewel Summoners, and the Jewel Summoners 
summoned crystal soldiers to fight Johan.

&quot;Arine!&quot; Sam cried. &quot;It&#39;s working.&quot;

Indeed, Mia was beginning to stir. She opened her eyes slightly and 
looked at the girl with the sparkling hair. &quot;Arine?&quot; she said.

&quot;Mia,&quot; Arine said, a smile coming to her face.

As the Ruby and the amethyst stopped glowing, and as Mia&#39;s and Arine&#39;s 
hair stopped sparkling, Mia found the strength to sit up. Mia realized 
that Sam had aided Arine in reviving her. &quot;Sam,&quot; she said to her 
childhood friend, &quot;thank you.&quot;

Mia and Sam embraced, happy that Mia was alive and kicking. Just then, 
as Sam looked over Mia&#39;s shoulder at Arine, he noticed something 
strange. &quot;Arine,&quot; he said.

&quot;What is it, Sam?&quot; asked the blonde.

&quot;The Red Ruby of Alvara,&quot; Sam said. &quot;It&#39;s not reacting to you.&quot;

&quot;What&quot; Arine asked.

&quot;Didn&#39;t the Blue Sapphire react when you touched it?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right!&quot; said Arine. &quot;Why isn&#39;t the Ruby reacting like the 
Sapphire did?&quot;

&quot;Arine...&quot; said Mia, who was staring intently at the red jewel in 
Arine&#39;s hand, &quot;...give me the Ruby.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; said Arine, surprised by the mesmerized look in Mia&#39;s eyes. Mia 
slowly extended her hand toward the Ruby. Then, just like before, the 
Ruby started moving on its own toward Mia. It lifted from Arine&#39;s hand 
and flew toward Mia&#39;s. As Mia grabbed the Ruby, it suddenly glowed a 
brilliant red. Mia&#39;s hair sparkled and the red glow of the Ruby engulfed 
the brunette.

----------

As the power of the Ruby engulfed her, Mia found herself atop a cliff. 
There was a guardrail to keep people from falling off. Below the cliff 
was a body of water, which was filled with large masses of land of about 
the same height as the cliff. The sun was beginning to set over the 
fjords across the valley of water.

Leaning on the guardrail, looking out over the fjords, was a young man, 
about 16 years old. He had blue eyes and elegant, silver-blond hair, and 
was wearing earmuffs to keep his ears warm in the northern climate. He 
had a smile on his face, obviously very relaxed by the view.

As the man enjoyed the sight before him, a young woman, about his age, 
walked up next to him to look at the sun set over the fjords as well. 
The girl had brown hair and brown eyes, very similar to Mia&#39;s hair and 
eye color. &quot;Magnificent view, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked the boy.

The boy looked at the girl and was suddenly enchanted by her beauty. He 
felt his heart beating faster, but was quickly able to calm himself. 
&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; he answered, still a little red in the cheeks. For a 
moment the two teens simply smiled at each other, feeling some sort of 
mystical energy pass between them. &quot;Well, um...&quot; said the boy, trying to 
break the silence. He held out his hand toward the girl and said, &quot;I&#39;m 
Rikhard. Rikhard Mustanen.&quot;

The girl took the boy&#39;s hand and responded, &quot;Erika Dagomar.&quot; After 
Rikhard and Erika had introduced themselves, they looked back over the 
fjords, admiring the sunset. &quot;Come here often?&quot; asked Erika.

&quot;No,&quot; replied Rikhard. &quot;This is actually my first time in Norway. I live 
in Finland.&quot;

&quot;Why are you all the way out here?&quot; asked the girl.

&quot;For this,&quot; said Rikhard, looking out at the fjords again. &quot;I needed to 
go some place to relax, get away from it all. You see, the leader of my 
clan--&quot; Rikhard suddenly stopped talking and corrected himself, &quot;I mean 
my household recently died.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; said Erika, a hint of sadness appearing in her face, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to 
hear that.&quot;

&quot;She lived a long life,&quot; Rikhard said. &quot;Many of us didn&#39;t expect Lady 
Heidi to live as long as she did. You see, my family carries a rare 
genetic defect.&quot;

&quot;What kind of defect?&quot;

&quot;It creates an anomalous protein that creates two bodily deformations. 
The most obvious deformation is the existence of points at the ends of 
the ears.&quot; Erika suddenly became excited at the mention of pointed ears, 
but was able to hide her excitement. &quot;The second deformation,&quot; Rikhard 
continued, &quot;is of the heart. It causes the heart to be weaker than 
normal, making the carrier more susceptible to fatigue, and in extreme 
cases, cardiac arrest. That&#39;s how Lady Heidi died.&quot; Then, a very solemn 
look appeared on Rikhard&#39;s face. He said, &quot;I have the same disorder.&quot; 
Erika gasped at what Rikhard had just said. &quot;And so,&quot; continued the boy, 
&quot;seeing one of my household die of this disease really shook me up, 
because it reminds me of my own mortality, how likely it is that this 
disease will ultimately lead to my own death.&quot;

Erika put her hand to Rikhard chin and turned his head to look at her. 
&quot;Please, don&#39;t talk like that, Rikhard,&quot; she said. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t worry 
yourself with things like this.&quot;

A small smile appeared on Rikhard&#39;s face. &quot;I don&#39;t even know how I&#39;m 
able to talk about this at all,&quot; said the Finn. &quot;We Mustanens are very 
sensitive about this subject. It&#39;s not just the heart condition, but the 
ears as well. I doubt that many people would understand pointed ears.&quot;

&quot;Rikhard,&quot; Erika said, a hint of nervousness in her voice, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if 
it&#39;s inappropriate to ask but, do you mind if I look at your ears?&quot; Much 
to Rikhard&#39;s surprise, he did not object to showing this stranger his 
unusual physical characteristic. He lifted his earmuffs ever so slightly 
off of his ears, revealing his pointed ears to Erika. The brunette 
looked at the ears in awe, bringing her hands to the sides of Rikhard&#39;s 
face to feel them for herself, making sure that they were real. Erika&#39;s 
next statement was a little surprising to Rikhard, &quot;They&#39;re 
actually...kind of cute.&quot;

&quot;Cute?&quot; Rikhard said with an amused expression. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard that 
term applied to a disease before.&quot;

----------

Rikhard and Erika spent the rest of the afternoon talking. After the sun 
had set, they continued to talk over dinner at the restaurant at the inn 
that Erika was staying at. Erika lived in Stockholm, Sweden and was in 
Norway for the view, just like Rikhard.

Rikhard and Erika ended up talking for so long that it was almost 10:00 
pm by the time they noticed what time it was. Rikhard walked Erika back 
to the room that she was staying in. &quot;Well, this is me,&quot; said Erika as 
they approached room #104. &quot;Thank you for walking me back to my room.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my pleasure,&quot; Rikhard said. &quot;Say,&quot; said the Fin, and idea coming 
to mind, &quot;would you like to have brunch with me tomorrow? I could come 
by at say...eleven-o-clock?&quot;

Erika smiled and said, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

&quot;I would too,&quot; said Rikhard, smiling as well. &quot;Well, good night, Erika. 
Pleasant dreams.&quot;

&quot;Same to you.&quot;

Rikhard started walking away as Erika entered her room. As soon as her 
door was closed, Erika rushed to the phone and dialed home. The phone 
rang several times before someone answered. &quot;Fredrika Dagomar speaking,&quot; 
said the voice of a mature woman, noticeably tired from the late hour.

&quot;Mother,&quot; Erika said at hearing her Clan Leader&#39;s voice.

&quot;Erika, is that you?&quot; asked Fredrika.

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Fredrika asked. &quot;You sound a little worked up.&quot;

Erika explained, &quot;Milady, I met someone today. A man with pointed ears. 
I think he&#39;s a descendant of the elves.&quot;

&quot;Is this true?&quot; Fredrika asked, excitement coming to her voice as well.

&quot;What should I do?&quot; asked Erika, awaiting instructions from the leader 
of the Dagomar Clan.

&quot;Follow this man,&quot; Fredrika instructed. &quot;Find out more about him. Report 
back as the situation develops.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Milady.&quot;

&quot;Good night, Erika.&quot;

&quot;Good night, mother.&quot; Erika hung up and started getting ready for bed. 
It took Erika several hours to find sleep. Her mind raced with the image 
of Rikhard and the possibility of the Jewel Summoners&#39; mission finally 
coming to an end.

----------

Rikhard came by Erika&#39;s room at 11:00 am, just like they had agreed. He 
was wearing his earmuffs to hide his pointed ears from the general 
public After Rikhard had knocked on the door, he heard Erika&#39;s voice say 
from inside, &quot;Just a moment.&quot;

&quot;Take your time,&quot; Rikhard said.

As Rikhard waited for Erika to exit, Rikhard coughed several times. 
However, Rikhard recovered just as Erika opened the door. She had 
obviously not heard his coughs. Erika was still combing the tangles out 
of her hair as she exited. &quot;Sorry, Rikhard,&quot; she said. &quot;I overslept.&quot;

&quot;I do that all the time,&quot; said Rikhard, his smile having never left his 
face. &quot;Shall we?&quot; Rikhard extended his elbow toward Erika and she took 
the joint in her hand. The two of them proceeded to the restaurant for 
brunch.

----------

&quot;What?!&quot; Erika cried as they talked. &quot;You want me to come with you back 
to Finland?&quot;

&quot;I know it&#39;s a little sudden,&quot; Rikhard said. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if I jumped the 
gun.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what it is about you,&quot; said Erika as she looked into 
Rikhard&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve never felt this strongly for someone I just met 
the day before.&quot; Rikhard and Erika looked deep into each other&#39;s eyes. 
The same mystical energy that drew them together the day before pulled 
them together again, causing them to lean toward each other. They met at 
the center of the table, their lips touched, and they kissed each other.

After a moment, they broke this kiss and looked back into each other&#39;s 
eyes. They both were very serious, neither of them fully comprehending 
the situation. Then, Erika smiled and responded, &quot;I would love to go to 
Finland with you.&quot;

&quot;Really? You mean it?&quot; Rikhard cried, a large smile coming to his face. 
Erika nodded and they embraced each other.

----------

After spending the next few days in Norway, Rikhard and Erika hopped on 
the plane that would bring them from Bergen, Norway to Oslo, to 
Helsinki, Finland, and then north to Ivalo, where the Mustanen Clan 
lived.

As they boarded the plane, Rikhard&#39;s cell phone started ringing. He 
picked up and said, &quot;Rikhard Mustanen speaking.&quot;

&quot;Ah, Rikhard,&quot; said a friendly, older male voice. &quot;It&#39;s your uncle, Lord 
Blake.&quot;

&quot;Oh hello, Uncle,&quot; Rikhard said.

&quot;Rikhard,&quot; Blake said, &quot;I have wonderful news.&quot;

&quot;What is it, Milord?&quot; Rikhard asked.

&quot;According to Lady Heidi&#39;s will,&quot; Blake explained, &quot;I am to succeed her 
as leader of the Mustanen Clan.&quot;

&quot;Why Uncle,&quot; Rikhard cried, &quot;that IS wonderful news!&quot;

&quot;I hope you will be able to attend my inauguration as the Clan Leader at 
eight-o-clock tonight.&quot;

&quot;I should be in Ivalo by seven.&quot;

&quot;I am glad to hear it. I&#39;ll see you tonight. Safe journey, Rikhard.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Lord Blake. Good bye.&quot; As soon as Rikhard had hung up, he 
turned to his girlfriend and said excitedly, &quot;Erika, wonderful news! My 
uncle has been chosen to succeed Lady Heidi as the leader of the 
Mustanen Clan!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s wonderful, Rikhard,&quot; said the brunette. &quot;You must be very proud 
of him.&quot;

&quot;I am. And I&#39;m sure Johan is too.&quot;

&quot;Johan?&quot; Erika asked.

Rikhard replied, &quot;My fraternal twin brother.&quot;

----------

Rikhard and Erika landed in Ivalo, Finland at 6:50 pm. The Mustanen Clan 
headquarters were not far, so it did not take long for them to arrive at 
the large building that Rikhard lived in. Rikhard&#39;s uncle, Lord Blake, 
was there to greet them. Blake was wearing a set of earmuffs similar to 
Rikhard&#39;s, which indicated that just like his nephew, he had also 
inherited the pointed ears.

After Rikhard and Erika had settled in, Rikhard decided to see his 
brother before resting. a bit. As he entered his brother&#39;s room, he saw 
a young man, no older than he was, sitting at his desk, intently reading 
a book on Norse mythology. &quot;Hello, Johan,&quot; Rikhard said to the boy.

The boy turned to the doorway to see Rikhard standing in front of him. 
&quot;Oh, hello Rikhard,&quot; Johan said, recognizing his fraternal twin brother. 
&quot;How was Norway?&quot;

&quot;It was fantastic,&quot; Rikhard replied. &quot;The people there were so nice. I&#39;m 
glad I went there.&quot;

&quot;Rikhard?&quot; a young, female voice said from the doorway.

Johan and Rikhard turned to see Erika standing in front of them. 
&quot;Johan,&quot; said Rikhard, walking to the girl, &quot;this is my girlfriend, 
Erika Dagomar. Erika, meet my twin brother, Johan.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you, Erika,&quot; Johan said.

&quot;Nice to meet you too, Johan,&quot; Erika said with a smile on her face.

&quot;The inauguration of Lord Blake as the new clan lord is taking place 
tonight,&quot; Rikhard said to Erika. &quot;Would you like to participate the 
ceremony?&quot;

&quot;This is only for members of the Mustanen Clan, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Erika said.

&quot;You are no less a member of the Mustanen Clan than I am,&quot; said Rikhard. 
&quot;I am sure that our mother and uncle will gladly give us their 
blessings.&quot; Rikhard then turned to Johan and said, &quot;Well, I think that I 
should get some rest. The flight took its toll on me. I&#39;ll see you 
tonight at Uncle&#39;s ceremony, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course, Brother,&quot; said Johan. Rikhard and Erika left Johan to his 
book and went off to Rikhard&#39;s room.

----------

After the inauguration of Lord Blake as the new leader of the Mustanen 
Clan had ended and most of the clan members had left, Rikhard and Erika 
met with Lord Blake and his sister-in-law, Rikhard and Johan&#39;s mother. 
The two teenagers had news to give to the two elders. &quot;Mother, Uncle,&quot; 
Rikhard said, &quot;Erika and I are getting married.&quot;

Blake and Rikhard&#39;s mother were surprised by the sudden decision. 
&quot;Really?&quot; Blake asked.

&quot;We love each other very much,&quot; Erika explained. &quot;We fell in love at 
first sight and we want to make the most of the time we have together.&quot;

&quot;I do sense the connection between you two,&quot; said Blake. &quot;And 
considering Rikhard&#39;s condition, I approve of this. Rikhard, Erika, you 
have my blessings.&quot;

Rikhard smiled and bowed his head to Blake in thanks. He then turned to 
the older woman and asked, &quot;Mother?&quot;

It took Rikhard&#39;s mother a moment to think over the situation. 
Eventually, she decided to smile and said, &quot;Rikhard, Erika, you have my 
blessings.&quot;

Both Rikhard and Erika smiled. They looked at each other, leaped into 
each other&#39;s arms and kissed, so happy that they had the blessings of 
the Mustanen Clan.

----------

Rikhard and Erika spent the next several weeks planning their wedding. 
With Erika being accepted into the Mustanen Clan, it was decided that 
the wedding would be held at the Mustanen household, in the same room 
where the clan leaders had been inaugurated.

&quot;This is amazing,&quot; said Erika as she decorated the hall. &quot;Two months 
ago, I would have never believed that I would be getting married at the 
age of sixteen.&quot;

&quot;Me neither,&quot; said Rikhard. &quot;It is pretty incredible.&quot;

&quot;So. Where should the refreshments go?&quot; Erika asked.

&quot;Well,&quot; said Rikhard, pointing to where the food was situated at Lord 
Blake&#39;s inauguration, &quot;I was thinking of having all of the food over on 
that side of the room. Maybe one table for refreshments, another for the 
cake, and another for lunch and dinner.&quot;

Rikhard and Erika started pushing one of the tables over to the side of 
the room. It was heavy, but they wanted their wedding to be perfect, so 
they decided that it was worth the effort. &quot;Phew,&quot; said Erika, wiping 
her brow after the table had been put into position. &quot;That was a 
workout. Maybe we should move the other tables later.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right,&quot; Rikhard agreed.

Just then, Rikhard was overcome by a violent fit of coughing. He covered 
his mouth and fell to his knees. &quot;Rikhard,&quot; Erika cried, rushing to her 
fianc&eacute;&#39;s side, &quot;are you all right?&quot;

When Rikhard removed his hand from his mouth, both he and Erika were 
horrified to see blood on his hand and dripping from his mouth! &quot;What&#39;s 
happening?&quot; Rikhard said, in a state of shock.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Erika said, lifting Rikhard to his feet and draping one of 
his arms over her shoulders. &quot;Let&#39;s get you to the infirmary.&quot;

----------

Using modern medicine and whatever mystical powers they had inherited 
from their elfin ancestors, the witch doctors of the Mustanen Clan 
diagnosed Rikhard&#39;s symptom as a result of his genetic disorder, the 
same disorder that gave many of the Mustanen Clan, including Rikhard and 
Blake, their visibly pointed ears.

&quot;When Sir Rikhard pushed the table,&quot; one of the doctors said, 
&quot;considerable stress was put on his heart. Because of this, his heart 
was unable to properly pump blood away from his lungs.&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s why I started coughing up blood,&quot; Rikhard realized.

&quot;It seems that in Sir Rikhard&#39;s case,&quot; said the doctor, &quot;his heart is 
losing strength gradually over a long period of time. It saddens me to 
say this, but I would estimate that Sir Rikhard does not have more than 
ten years left.&quot;

The horrifying news of Rikhard&#39;s inevitable fate was too much for Erika 
to bear. The brunette fell to her hands and knees and broke down into 
tears. Using what strength he had regained, Rikhard managed to stand up 
and go to Erika, embracing her, trying to comfort her.

----------

The day of the wedding arrived. As leader of the clan, Lord Blake was 
chosen as the minister. All of the clan members were happy for Rikhard 
and Erika...all except for Johan. Although he hid it well, his 
suspicions about Erika were growing.

&quot;Well, here we are,&quot; said Erika as she and Rikhard entered their room. 
&quot;Man and wife.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Rikhard. &quot;Here we are indeed.&quot;

Despite the joyous occasion of their union, the celebratory atmosphere 
was simply a euphemism for the sadness that Erika and Rikhard felt. 
&quot;What are we going to do, Rikhard?&quot; asked Erika, again saddened by 
Rikhard&#39;s steadily worsening condition. &quot;What are we going to do?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Erika,&quot; Rikhard said. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t stand to be without you,&quot; Erika mourned. &quot;Why did it have to be 
this way?&quot;

&quot;This gene has been passed down through my family for generations,&quot; 
Rikhard explained. &quot;We believe there was once a gene that was able to 
counteract the ill effects of this one, but it has been lost to the 
sands of time.&quot;

&quot;I just with there was something we could do to keep you alive.&quot;

&quot;I know, my darling,&quot; Rikhard said, embracing his wife. &quot;I know.&quot; After 
holding each other for a moment, Rikhard then said, &quot;There is...one way 
for me to live on.&quot;

Erika looked at her husband and asked, &quot;What is it.&quot;

&quot;Children,&quot; Rikhard replied. Rikhard walked to his desk and picked up 
the white sapphire that he carries. &quot;I told you that our father had the 
same illness that I have,&quot; Rikhard explained. As Rikhard spoke, he used 
the power of the sapphire to transfer a small portion of his spirit 
inside it. &quot;Our mother knew,&quot; he continued, &quot;that Lord Heikki would live 
on inside his sons, and so he does, inside me and Johan.&quot; Rikhard put 
the sapphire back down on his desk and walked back to Erika&#39;s side. &quot;The 
doctor said I had ten years left at the most. That doesn&#39;t necessarily 
mean a full ten years. It could be five years, one year, maybe even a 
matter of months. This may be the only chance I have to pass on my 
lineage.&quot;

&quot;Rikhard,&quot; Erika cried, &quot;don&#39;t you know what you are asking?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m asking to consummate our love,&quot; Rikhard repeated himself. &quot;We do 
not have much time left, and we may not have another chance. I want to 
become one with you before we run out of time.&quot; Erika looked into her 
lap, thinking about what Rikhard was suggesting. &quot;Please, Erika.&quot;

Tears started welling in the young woman&#39;s eyes. &quot;Oh, Rikhard!&quot; she 
cried, jumping into her husband&#39;s arms. They wrapped their arms around 
one another and met in a passionate kiss.

----------

As Johan walked down the long hallway, he could hear moaning from 
Rikhard&#39;s room. However, it did not hit him what was happening until he 
heard Erika&#39;s voice crying out from behind the door. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; said 
Johan as he made a bolt for the door. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not too late!&quot;

Johan was petrified by what he saw when he opened his brother&#39;s door. 
Both Rikhard and Erika were naked. Rikhard was lying unconscious on his 
bed; Erika was sitting next to him, looking at his body. With all of his 
suspicions about Erika painfully confirmed, Johan&#39;s rage exploded from 
him. &quot;You bitch!&quot; Johan screamed at the woman before him. &quot;You people 
haven&#39;t changed in fifteen hundred years. You&#39;re still trying to 
complete your mission. Well let me tell you something, Dagomar, you will 
never destroy the elves completely! The Prophecy of Awakening will come 
to pass, I assure you! The new age of the elves will come to pass and 
you Jewel Summoners will be destroyed just like our people were 
destroyed!&quot;

Johan rushed to his brother&#39;s desk and picked up the white sapphire that 
Rikhard had kept with him. Using the white sapphire&#39;s power, Johan 
summoned a powerful force that threw Erika from the bed and onto the 
floor. Erika found herself lying next to her coat and she quickly 
reached into it, pulling out a pyrite crystal. Erika tried to use the 
pyrite to call other members of the Dagomar Clan to her aid. Erika 
believed that she got the message across, but Johan threw another attack 
at her, knocking the crystal from her hand before she could get a 
confirmation.

With the power of Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire with him, Johan chased Erika 
out of his brother&#39;s room. &quot;I&#39;ll never forgive you!&quot; the boy screamed, 
throwing attack after attack at Erika. &quot;You corrupt my brother&#39;s heart, 
then you have your way with him, knowing full well what it would do to 
him! You bitch!&quot;

Erika found the exit and ran out into the snow-covered Scandinavian 
landscape. Johan continued chasing. &quot;I&#39;m not going to let you die from 
the cold, Dagomar!&quot; he said. Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire started glowing 
white and a powerful force threw Erika backwards, toward Johan. Using 
his free hand, Johan grabbed Erika by the neck. &quot;I will be the one to 
kill you,&quot; he said, looking Erika square in the eyes. &quot;I will not grant 
you the luxury of dying from anything besides my hands.&quot;

Slowly, Johan started tightening his grip on Erika&#39;s neck. The brunette 
started chocking as her windpipe was crushed. she struggled to break 
free from Johan&#39;s grip, but she could not overcome Johan&#39;s strength. 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Johan said, an evil grin coming across his face. &quot;That&#39;s it. 
Struggle all you want. Try to escape. Let me see the fear in your eyes 
as the life drains from you.&quot; Erika&#39;s eyes rolled back in her head as 
Johan continued to tighten his grip on her throat. Her struggling slowly 
became less and less violent as her strength left her. &quot;Die. Die! DIE!!&quot; 
cried Johan.

Just then, out of nowhere, a glowing red javelin flew toward Johan. His 
foresight alerting his to the danger, Johan dropped Erika and dodged out 
of the way. The boy looked in the direction that the javelin was thrown 
from and saw a band of several elderly warriors, each one of them 
holding glowing red spinel crystals.

&quot;Madame Erika!&quot; Lord Sven cried at seeing the young woman lying 
unconscious on the snow. &quot;What have you done to Madame Erika, you 
monster?&quot; Sven summoned a vehicle, similar in design to a motorcycle, 
composed entirely of glowing red crystal. He drove the vehicle straight 
toward Johan, but the boy jumped out of the way before he was run over. 
As he drove by, Sven grabbed Erika and picked her up.

Seeing that Erika was being dragged to safety, Johan used the power of 
Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire and threw another attack at the Jewel Summoner. 
Before the attack hit, Sven took out a glowing apatite crystal and used 
the green crystal&#39;s power to drag him and Erika toward the other Jewel 
Summoners. Johan&#39;s attack hit the snow where the spinel vehicle had 
disappeared.

Sven retreated behind the other Jewel Summoners, who were standing as a 
wall to protect Erika. Once he and Erika were blocked off from Johan, 
Sven took out an amethyst crystal and held it over Erika&#39;s body. As the 
crystal glowed purple, the unconscious girl started breathing more 
easily.

Johan held up the white sapphire. The transparent crystal started 
glowing white as Johan prepared to fire another attack at the Jewel 
Summoners. However, one of the Jewel Summoners pulled out a crystal of 
the deepest red. The red crystal started glowing and the white sapphire 
stopped glowing. The Jewel Summoner had somehow used his crystal to 
negate the power of the sapphire! Suddenly, Johan knew what it was that 
the Jewel Summoner was holding.

In awe of the Ruby that the Jewel Summoner held, Johan was distracted 
from the other Jewel Summoners summoning more crystal vehicles. Before 
Johan could snap out of his trance, the Jewel Summoners were already too 
far ahead for him to catch up.

----------

When Erika awoke, she found herself in a warm bed, a harsh contrast to 
the snow-covered landscape that was her most recent memory. As she 
opened her eyes, the brunette recognized the setting of the infirmary at 
the Dagomar Clan household in Stockholm, Sweden. She saw several people 
watching over her. &quot;Erika!&quot; an older woman cried cried. &quot;How are you 
feeling?&quot; Erika recognized the voice as that of her mother and leader of 
the Dagomar Clan, Lady Fredrika.

&quot;Not so well,&quot; Erika said in a raspy voice. &quot;I have a slitting headache, 
and it&#39;s hard to breath.&quot;

&quot;That man chocked you to the point of near asphyxiation,&quot; said Lord 
Sven. &quot;You&#39;re experiencing symptoms of hypoxia.&quot;

&quot;Choked me?&quot; Erika asked. The girl then remembered what had happened. 
She jumped to a sitting position and cried, &quot;Johan!&quot;

As she sat up, Erika suddenly groaned in pain and collapsed again. Her 
throat hurt and she struggled to breath. &quot;Easy, Erika!&quot; said a 
brown-haired boy in his early teens. &quot;Easy!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve contracted a case of laryngitis,&quot; said one of the doctors, &quot;you 
should not exert yourself for the next few weeks.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Erika protested. &quot;I can&#39;t stay here. Johan will find me.&quot;

&quot;Johan?&quot; asked the boy. &quot;Who is Johan?&quot;

&quot;Rikhard Mustanen&#39;s brother,&quot; Erika explained. &quot;Rikhard died of cardiac 
arrest and Johan blames me for it. He will never stop hunting me.&quot; Erika 
realized, &quot;I have to get away, as far away from here as possible. If 
Johan finds me, all of you will be in danger.&quot;

&quot;Where would you go?&quot; Fredrika asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the girl replied. &quot;All I have to do is keep Johan&#39;s 
attention away from Stockholm.&quot;

&quot;How will you accomplish that?&quot; asked her mother.

Erika thought for a moment about how to keep Johan away from the 
household of the Dagomar Clan. &quot;The Red Ruby of Alvara,&quot; she answered. 
&quot;Johan saw one of my rescuers use it. He will most likely try tracking 
the Ruby with his brother&#39;s white sapphire.&quot; Looking straight at 
Fredrika, Erika said, &quot;If you give me the Ruby, I can lead Johan away 
from here, and you will be safe from him.&quot;

&quot;The Ruby?&quot; asked Sven.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Erika,&quot; said Fredrika. &quot;I can&#39;t let you have the Ruby. I was 
entrusted with its protection when Lady Kerstin died last year and I 
can&#39;t risk letting the Ruby be lost.&quot;

&quot;Please, Mother,&quot; urged Erika. &quot;It&#39;s the only way.&quot;

Fredrika thought about it for a moment. Eventually, she responded, &quot;All 
right. But please, stay in bed for at least a few more days. Give 
yourself a chance to recover some strength.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Milady,&quot; Erika said, settling back into the bed.

&quot;When will you be back?&quot; the boy asked Erika.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Erik,&quot; replied the brunette. &quot;If I do return, I will 
contact Mother and tell her.&quot;

&quot;Sister,&quot; the boy said, &quot;I hope you know what you&#39;re doing.&quot;

&quot;So do I, Brother,&quot; Erika said, closing her eyes. &quot;So do I.&quot;

----------

After several days of partially recovering from her ordeal, Erika left 
Stockholm and started her journey. As February, 1987 rolled by, Erika 
had not menstruated. It was then that she knew that she was pregnant. 
With her late husband&#39;s child inside her body, Erika knew that she had 
to do everything in her power to evade Johan until the child was born.

October came and Erika found herself in Japan. Having not fully 
recovered before fleeing Sweden, Erika had become more susceptible to 
respiratory disease, and was still suffering, even 10 months after her 
last encounter with Johan. The combination of breathing difficulty and 
the growing baby inside her womb made it difficult for the 17-year-old 
to make her way. She had acquired a walking stick to help her walk.

Erika tried her best to stay away from the cities. Johan would most 
likely suspect that in her ill condition, Erika would try to find 
lodging in nicer places where her risk of disease would be lower. 
However, Erika managed to live in deep forests, far away from the big 
cities, only going into town to buy food, water, and whatever medicinal 
herbs she could find. After the last 10 months of moving from place to 
place, living off of whatever she could find, enduring the elements, 
Erika was surprised that she had not miscarried.

It was in the late afternoon of October 13th that Erika came across an 
abandoned hut in the Japanese countryside. It was just as Erika was 
approaching the hut that she felt a sharp pain in her abdomen. She fell 
to her knees and held her stomach in pain. &quot;Now?&quot; Erika said to herself. 
She had always hoped that she would have her child in hospital, 
surrounded by friends and family. However, she was at that moment going 
into labor in the middle of nowhere, Japan.

Before her contractions became too painful for her to bear, Erika made 
her way to the hut and prepared to give birth. She laid down a towel in 
order to prevent the child from coming in contact with the floor, which 
was probably unsanitary.

Erika was in agonizing pain for the entire night. It was then that she 
wished more than anything for Rikhard to be with her to comfort her, for 
the child to have a father to look into the face of as he came into the 
world, to convince Johan to stop chasing her.

The sky was beginning to turn a dark blue as the first light of October 
14th, 1987 appeared. Erika entered the final stages of labor and she 
felt an uncontrollable urge to push. Erika bore down, pushing the baby 
out of her uterus with every contraction. However, she was overcome by a 
fit of coughing as she felt the baby&#39;s head move out. After she had 
recovered from her coughing, she could hear an infant crying. Although 
exhausted from labor, sleepless night, and difficulty breathing, Erika 
was still able to smile as it sank in that she was now a mother.

Erika wrapped the infant in the towel that she had given birth to him 
on, after which she raised the child up onto her body to clean and 
examine him. Upon examination, Erika found that the baby was, in fact, 
not a &quot;he&quot;, but a &quot;she&quot;. Erika had given birth to a girl.

Erika&#39;s initial examination showed that the baby was healthy. She was 
moving her arms and legs energetically and had a loud cry. However, as 
Erika began to recover from the pain of delivery and regained her powers 
of perception, she noticed the baby&#39;s pointed ears! &quot;Oh no,&quot; Erika said, 
&quot;No! Please God, NO!!&quot; Erika held the baby close to her body and cried, 
knowing that the child would have to endure the same disease that her 
father had, a weak heart that would make her twice as likely to die from 
cardiac arrest than of old age.

Erika raised her worn-out coat above her chest and brought the infant&#39;s 
head to her left nipple, breastfeeding her child. As the baby suckled on 
his mother&#39;s teat, Erika noticed a dull, red glow from nearby. She 
looked and noticed that the glow was coming from the pocket of her 
pants, which she had naturally removed upon entering the hut. Letting 
her child rest on her body to continue breastfeeding, Erika took her 
pants and fished into her pocket to see what it was. The object that 
Erika removed was the Red Ruby of Alvara. &quot;Johan,&quot; Erika realized. &quot;He&#39;s 
near.&quot; Erika looked at her child and wondered, &quot;What am I going to do? 
What happens if Johan finds her? I can&#39;t just leave her here.&quot;

At that moment, the infant did something very surprising. She removed 
her mouth from Erika&#39;s nipple and looked directly at the Ruby. She 
seemed entranced by it. The baby reached toward the Ruby to touch it. As 
the baby&#39;s fingers touched the Ruby, the red glow that the crystal gave 
off intensified greatly, giving off a mystical energy that Erika felt 
quite fully. &quot;The Red Ruby of Alvara is reacting to her touch!&quot; Erika 
cried. Suddenly, despite the horror that she had felt upon learning that 
her child had inherited Rikhard&#39;s illness, a large smile appeared on 
Erika&#39;s face. &quot;It&#39;s happened,&quot; she realized. &quot;The elf! I&#39;ve given birth 
to the Legendary Elf that the Prophecy of Awakening speaks of! It&#39;s 
happened! It&#39;s finally happened!&quot;

The red glow of the Ruby suddenly fluctuated as something interrupted 
its power. Erika knew that Johan was tracking the Ruby with another 
piece of corundum, most likely Rikhard&#39;s white sapphire. &quot;I can&#39;t leave 
the Ruby with the child,&quot; Erika knew, despite the fact that her child 
needed the Ruby to bring about the new age of the elves, &quot;Johan will 
find her.&quot;

Erika soon experienced a series of several small contractions, which 
resulted in the delivery of the afterbirth. Erika knew that she had to 
get away quickly before Johan got to her. Although she was still weak 
from delivering her child, Erika was still able to pick up her walking 
stick, stand up, put on her pants, and leave the hut through a back 
door. Unbeknownst to Erika, postnatal blood was dripping from the 
placenta, leaving a trail toward the back door and into the forest.

The sky was turning yellow as the sun began to rise. The blood from the 
afterbirth had since dripped away and the child&#39;s circulatory system had 
closed. As Erika trekked through the forest, she came across a river. 
With nowhere else to go and Johan quickly closing on her position, the 
brunette had no choice but to leave the baby there. Erika used a dagger 
that she carried to cut the umbilical cord, after which she threw the 
placenta into the river.

With her baby still wrapped in the towel, Erika set her down on the 
river bank. She said to the infant, as if she could understand what her 
mother was saying, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry that I can&#39;t be there to watch you 
grow, watch you find love, have children. I&#39;m sorry that I can&#39;t be 
there when you fulfill your destiny and bring about the new age of the 
elves.&quot; Her voice was filled with so much sorrow. Erika would rather die 
that leave her child all alone without her mother or her father. 
However, she knew that she had no choice. Erika took out the Red Ruby of 
Alvara and held it close to her child&#39;s face. Erika said, this time with 
intent rather than sorrow, &quot;Remember this Ruby, my child. It may be ten 
or twenty years before you see this Ruby again, but please, remember 
it.&quot; Erika kissed her child on her forehead, and then stood. The baby 
started crying, as if sensing that her mother was about to leave her. 
Erika&#39;s heart shattered as her daughter cried for her. Tears gushed from 
Erika&#39;s eyes as she turned her back and walked away.

When she was sure that she was far enough away from her child so that 
Johan would not find her, Erika took the Ruby and started concentrating 
on it. &quot;I hope this works,&quot; she said to herself. She remembered Rikhard 
transfer a portion of his spirit into his white sapphire just before he 
died. Although not a descendant of the elves like Rikhard or Johan, the 
Dagomars were among the most powerful of all the Jewel Summoners. Erika 
hoped that she was powerful enough to do what Rikhard had done. &quot;If my 
daughter ever finds the Ruby again,&quot; Erika thought, &quot;this should help 
her remember.&quot; Just then, Erika&#39;s concentration was broken by her 
coughing. &quot;I hope that was enough,&quot; she said. Erika put the Ruby into 
her coat pocket and continued wandering through the forest.

Erika came to a ridge, which overlooked the waterfall that was upstream 
of where she had left her child. Unable to move very quickly due to her 
fatigue, it did not take long for Johan to catch up with her. As Erika 
struggled to get away, Johan simply walked up behind her and picked her 
up by the scruff of her worn-out coat. &quot;I found you, Dagomar,&quot; Johan 
grinned.

&quot;You don&#39;t understand, Johan,&quot; Erika said weakly.

&quot;Oh, I understand,&quot; Johan said, refusing to hear Erika&#39;s explanation. &quot;I 
am not the fool that you take me for, Dagomar!&quot; still holding Erika by 
the scruff of her jacket, Johan kicked her hard in the back, knocking 
her to the ground. Erika started coughing violently, a small bit of 
blood dripping from her mouth. Johan kicked Erika again and again. When 
he felt that he had kicked Erika enough, he picked her up by her neck 
just as he had done back in Finland. &quot;Suffer, Dagomar,&quot; he said. &quot;You 
and all the Jewel Summoners will suffer for the pain that you have 
inflicted upon my kind, upon my family, upon my father, upon my 
brother!&quot;

Before Erika had choked to death, the white sapphire in Johan&#39;s hand 
began glowing. It was pulling Johan toward Erika&#39;s jacket. Johan dropped 
Erika and reached into Erika&#39;s pocket and pulled out the Ruby. &quot;The Red 
Ruby of Alvara,&quot; said Johan, amazed that he was actually holding the 
fabled jewel. &quot;I have been tracking this crystal all over the world with 
my brother&#39;s white sapphire.&quot;

As Johan was distracted by his awe of the Ruby, Erika crawled to the 
edge of the waterfall and painfully got to her feet. &quot;I tried to tell 
you, Johan,&quot; she said. &quot;But I see that it is pointless to try to 
convince you. Since there is nothing more that I can do to help, my life 
may just as well end here. I&#39;m sorry, Johan.&quot; Erika closed her eyes and 
spread her arms out to her sides. A single tear dripped down her cheek. 
&quot;Rikhard...&quot; she said wistfully. Erika leaned backward and let gravity 
pull her off the side of the ridge, her body being engulfed by the mist 
of the waterfall.

----------

Mia sat in stun as her vision ended and the red glow of the Ruby 
stopped. As her senses returned to her, she remembered where she was: in 
Zurich, Switzerland, upon the roof of the French bakery that housed the 
Jewel Summoner headquarters.

&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Sam cried at seeing Mia&#39;s hair sparkle and 
both the Ruby and Mia&#39;s body glow bright red for several seconds.

&#39;The Ruby reacted to Mia&#39;s touch?&#39; Johan thought to himself in awe. He 
looked at the Blue Sapphire and his hand and realized that it was 
pulling him toward Arine, not the brunette that the Ruby had reacted to. 
&#39;But the Sapphire is pulling toward Arine,&#39; he thought. &#39;Mia&#39;s Jewel 
Summoner abilities should be affecting the pull of the Sapphire toward 
her like back at Oceanside.&#39; Johan gasped as the truth hit him like a 
ton of bricks. &#39;...unless the powers that the Ruby sensed were coming 
from Mia!&#39;

&quot;I understand now,&quot; said Mia in monotone, the truth having dawned upon 
her as well. &quot;I understand everything that&#39;s happened.&quot; Coming out of 
her trancelike state, Mia stood up and looked at Johan. The vibrance 
returning to her voice, Mia called out to her uncle, &quot;Johan. I just had 
a vision. A vision just like Arine had when she touched the Sapphire for 
the first time. I was not affecting the power of the Ruby at all when 
you used it to home in on me at Oceanside. The power the Ruby was 
sensing actually was coming from me. The Ruby is for me, just like the 
Sapphire is for Arine. Give the Sapphire to Arine.&quot;

&quot;The Sapphire is pulling toward Arine,&quot; Johan said to himself still 
coming to grips with the truth that he had realized. &quot;If Mia was 
unintentionally affecting the power of Alvara&#39;s crystal, it would be 
pulling toward Mia!&quot;

Then, Arine spoke, &quot;I can sense it.&quot; Mia and the Jewel Summoners looked 
at the blonde, wondering what she was talking about. &quot;The Sapphire is 
calling to me...&quot; Arine continued. She then turned to Mia and finished 
her sentence, &quot;...just like the Ruby called out to you.&quot;

Arine reached toward Johan, trying to affect the power of the Sapphire. 
Johan felt the pull of the Sapphire intensify, as if Arine was pulling 
at it with her own hands. Johan gripped the Sapphire tightly, engaging 
in a tug-of-war with Arine. However, with the Sapphire desperately 
trying to find its way back to Arine, the power of the Sapphire 
prevailed over Johan, pulling the Finn toward Arine. Johan let go of the 
Sapphire and grabbed a hold of the ledge of the roof of the French 
bakery.

As the Sapphire flew into Arine&#39;s outstretched hand, both of Alvara&#39;s 
crystals started glowing; the Sapphire glowed bright blue and the Ruby 
glowed bright red. As the crystals started glowing, the holders of both 
the crystals, Mia and Arine, felt the crystals calling to one another. 
Mia and Arine held the crystals toward one another, the light that they 
gave off intensifying as they came closer and closer together.

As the Red Ruby and the Blue Sapphire of Alvara touched one another, a 
bright flash of magenta light came from the point of contact. The light 
was so bright that nobody could make out the silhouette of the Ruby or 
the Sapphire. Both Mia and Arine arched their backs, as if some great, 
mystical energy was shooting through them like the electricity of a 
defibrillator. Their hair sparkled brilliantly as both of their bodies 
were engulfed in a magenta glow.
