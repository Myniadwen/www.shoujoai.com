<h1>Spring (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../mascots/index.html"> Shoujo-Ai Mascots</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/toweringman.html">Toweringman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../mascots/spring-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Arine rubbed her eyes. She had been dreaming of Mia, dreaming of kissing 
her. She smiled, still half asleep, and hugged her pillow. She had woken 
up once during the night to find Mia in her arms, her soft dark hair 
against Arine&#39;s cheek. She remembered kissing her hair before she fell 
asleep again.

She felt like sleeping here with Mia for the whole day, but the bright 
daylight made her turn and twist to find a shade. She suddenly realized 
that she was rolling all across the bed and couldn&#39;t find Mia anywhere. 
She opened her eyes to look around her. Mia&#39;s blanket and pillow lay 
beside her, but the girl was not there. Arine was about to sit up when 
she felt a hand smoothe her hair. She started a bit, then relaxed, 
closing her eyes again.

&quot;I thought you were going to sleep all day,&quot; Mia&#39;s voice said. Her 
beautiful soft voice. Arine smiled.

&quot;I am going to. Come back here in my arms,&quot; she murmured lovingly, her 
eyes closed.

Mia laughed, the wooden chair creaking softly as she rose. &quot;No way,&quot; she 
said. &quot;I laid by your side for at least an hour, waiting for you to wake 
up, but it was hopeless.&quot; She sat by the bed and lay her head next to 
Arine&#39;s, smoothing Arine&#39;s hair.

&quot;Did you wake up with the sunrise?&quot;, Arine murmured.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mia said, smiling to herself. &quot;I couldn&#39;t get sleep, thinking of 
all the things I want to do with you today.&quot;

Arine turned to face Mia and took a slightly trembling breath as she 
looked into her eyes. If she was going to get so breathless right from 
the morning, this would be a long day. She lifted her hand to Mia&#39;s hair 
and caressed it, then gently stroked her ear. Mia blushed.

&quot;Now listen you,&quot; Mia said with a grin, &quot;I made breakfast for you, since 
I happened to have about half a day to spare.&quot; Arine frowned and 
considered tugging her friend&#39;s ear. Mia cleared her throat. &quot;I&#39;ll go 
make us tea and leave you to change into your clothes.&quot; She rose with a 
smile for Arine and murmured under her breath, &quot;otherwise we won&#39;t get 
to the breakfast until afternoon.&quot;

Arine watched Mia&#39;s back as the girl left the room. Her hips, too. She 
had a whole lot of things to turn around in her mind. She might never 
get all of them straightened up, but some were making good progress. She 
sat up with a small smile. It was ages since anyone had made her 
breakfast. She hummed as she pulled off her nightshirt, put on a bra and 
chose a thin linen shirt with a little emboidery.

After buttoning on a knee-length skirt she walked barefoot to the 
kitchen. Mia smiled to her as she set the teakettle on the table. She 
pulled a chair for Arine and motioned for her to sit. Arine beamed at 
her and at the array of food as she sat down. &quot;Oh, Mia&quot;, she said. &quot;It 
looks delicious.&quot;

Mia smiled, a sweet blushing smile that made Arine&#39;s head spin. &quot;You get 
special attention from me,&quot; the dark-eyed girl said softly as she 
lowered her head to Arine. Arine lifted her hand to caress Mia&#39;s hair as 
she was kissed slowly and deeply.

She opened her eyes to watch Mia&#39;s lips move away from hers, glistening 
with wetness. She felt hot. She opened her mouth and had to take a 
breath before attempting to speak. &quot;Can I have that every morning?&quot;, she 
said quietly.

&quot;Yes, you can,&quot; Mia said, opening her eyes. Arine loved her dark long 
lashes. &quot;But I&#39;m not going to make breakfast for you every morning, just 
so you know&quot;, she said mischievously.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Arine said with a smile. She didn&#39;t mind at all.

             .......

Arine sipped the last of her tea and glanced across the table at Mia. 
The dark-haired girl was sitting on the opposite chair, looking at Arine 
with a smile and gently caressing her arm with her hand.

&quot;Is it so enjoyable to watch me eat?&quot;, Arine asked. The girl looked so 
adorable just sitting there that Arine wanted to hug her.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mia said and tilted her head a bit. It was not as if Arine needed 
to ask, really. Just watching Mia eat, or comb her hair, or even read a 
book, was something Arine would enjoy too.

&quot;So,&quot; Arine said fondly, &quot;do you want to tell me about all the things 
you planned for today?&quot;

&quot;I want to go walking with you. And swim with you and have a picnic on 
the hills,&quot; Mia said without hesitation. Arine smiled. All the things 
they would do on an ordinary day.

&quot;And kiss you. And watch you change your clothes.&quot;

Arine cleared her throat, trying not to blush. &quot;Straightforward, aren&#39;t 
you?&quot;

&quot;I think you like to watch me undress too,&quot; Mia said with her eyes 
downcast, a mischievous smile on her lips. Arine rose and stepped to 
Mia. &quot;I love to,&quot; Arine said and gently smoothed her dark hair, trying 
not to blush even more at her own words. The other girl&#39;s playfulness 
was certainly catching onto her.

Yesterday morning, Arine had thought that it would be nice to walk to 
the town some day with Mia and see other people for a change. But after 
all that had happened she wanted to have Mia all to herself. Just the 
two of them, doing all the things they always did. Just... as more than 
friends now. &quot;Sounds nice, what you said,&quot; Arine said with a smile. When 
she didn&#39;t think about it, everything felt just like before. But there 
was something in the way Mia looked into her eyes that made her heart 
race and her thoughts stagger.

&quot;What is it?&quot;, Mia asked with a quizzical smile, looking up at her.

&quot;I can&#39;t think when you look at me like that,&quot; Arine murmured.

&quot;Well it&#39;s your fault for looking so beautiful,&quot; Mia said, gazing at her 
through her lashes.

Arine tried to frown with little success. Leave it to Mia to make her 
blush, even when the girl was so stunning herself. Arine was definitely 
going to get her back. After she regained some of her composure, maybe. 
&quot;You do the sandwiches, okay?&quot;, she said halfheartedly.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Mia said with a smile, still looking Arine in the eyes. There 
was so much affection in the look, so much appreciation and wanting that 
Arine could not resist her. She lowered herself to put her hands under 
Mia&#39;s arms and pulled her up at no resistance, then wrapped her arms 
around her soft, slender body. She brushed her lips gently over Mia&#39;s, 
enjoying the infinitely seducing feel of her full breasts before 
touching Mia&#39;s lips with her tongue. Mia closed her eyes and pressed her 
breasts even more firmly against Arine, placing a few small kisses on 
Arine&#39;s lips before moving on to caress Arine&#39;s tongue with hers. Arine 
let the shorter girl have her way exploring her mouth.

After a good while Mia placed a last soft kiss on Arine&#39;s lip and slowly 
opened her eyes. Arine could not get enough of that gaze. It made her 
want to kiss Mia more, even deeper and longer. She was beautiful.

&quot;I&#39;ve wanted this all night,&quot; Mia said softly. Arine loosened her arms 
around Mia and sat down on her chair, then took Mia&#39;s waist and pulled 
her gently. Mia sat down in Arine&#39;s lap, wrapping her arms around the 
yellow-haired girl again. &quot;You can wake me if you want to kiss,&quot; Arine 
said, her eyes resting in the deep chestnut brown of Mia&#39;s. She couldn&#39;t 
imagine a better reason to wake up. She ran her eyes over Mia&#39;s lips and 
the beautiful dark brown locks of hair curling over her cheeks. The girl 
looked like she desperately needed more affection. Arine buried her 
hands in Mia&#39;s hair and pulled her mouth down to hers, trying not to 
concentrate too much on the feeling of Mia&#39;s breasts above hers, of 
Mia&#39;s thighs around her waist and her hips pressed intimately against 
Arine. She was going to get too carried away even just enjoying the feel 
of Mia&#39;s kisses.

Finally Mia parted their lips and gave a sigh of pleasure, pressing her 
head on Arine&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I think I could focus on something now, for a 
while at least,&quot; she said softly, then leaned back to smile at Arine. 
&quot;Why didn&#39;t we do this sooner?&quot;

Arine laughed. The girl had such a funny way of thinking. &quot;Would you 
have wanted me to just kiss you back then at the market then?&quot;

Mia smiled sweetly. &quot;I don&#39;t know... I think I wouldn&#39;t have minded.&quot;

&quot;After a few months with you I&#39;ll start talking like that too,&quot; Arine 
said, shaking her head.

&quot;And what if you do?&quot;, Mia asked, her head tilted and her eyes 
twinkling.

&quot;You don&#39;t want to find out. Now, did you want to go walking, maybe?&quot;, 
Arine said fondly.

             .......

The day was baking hot. Mia was grateful for the fresh breeze that 
caressed her hair and made her short skirt flap. She had taken her 
sandals off to walk in the shallow water, even though she had to dash 
every now and then to dodge a bigger wave. She glanced at Arine walking 
a bit further away from the waterline, scanning the sand for pretty 
seashells. Her Arine. Mia admired her long yellow hair shining in the 
sunlight, her beautiful slim waist. She could not well understand how 
she had been able to ignore the girl&#39;s charm for so long. She twirled 
the basket behind her back and smiled, feeling like the lovestruck 
little fool she was. She suddenly squeaked as a big wave struck her 
ankles, splashing water all over her skirt. She hurriedly lifted the 
basket higher as the water rose up to her knee. Even her underwear felt 
wet. Arine laughed at her. Mia felt even more the fool, laughing and 
splashing, trying to keep even a bit of her skirt dry.

&quot;What might you be doing?&quot;, Arine yelled with a grin.

&quot;Trying to catch your attention,&quot; Mia said with a sweet smile.

&quot;Mmmm, that&#39;s a good start. Maybe if you soaked your shirt too?&quot;, Arine 
said. Mia kicked water at the taller girl.

&quot;Stop that or you&#39;ll regret it,&quot; Arine warned her.

&quot;Let&#39;s go swimming,&quot; Mia shouted. She wanted to get rid of her wet skirt 
and soak Arine.

&quot;You are already swimming as far as I can tell,&quot; the yellow-haired girl 
said, moving away from Mia&#39;s range. Mia walked to the shore, elegantly 
stepping over the crest of the next, smaller wave. She walked well away 
from the waterline and set the basket down, then unbuttoned her wet 
skirt, took it off and tossed it on the ground. She could see Arine out 
of the corner of her eye, watching her, but she deliberately did not 
look back at her, setting her eyes on the sandstone hills instead. She 
pulled her shirt over her head and lay it on the basket, then undid her 
bra with a small smile. Even though Arine had seen her do it countless 
times before, Mia felt her face colouring at the thrill of undressing. 
She dropped her bra on the basket with a small sideways glance at Arine, 
enjoying the sun on her breasts almost as much as Arine&#39;s eyes, then 
turned to face her. &quot;Too bad,&quot; she said and pulled her panties off a 
just bit more slowly than she usually would. &quot;I&#39;ll go by myself, then,&quot; 
she said with a mischievous smile, trying not to blush too fiercely.

Arine looked like she would go anywhere with Mia right then. &quot;We are 
definitely going to get you a swimsuit.&quot;

&quot;No we&#39;re not. We are going to get rid of your swimsuit,&quot; Mia said, in 
no hurry to get into the water as long as she could make Arine look at 
her like that.

&quot;I guess I could come too,&quot; Arine said lightly, walking to Mia. &quot;I feel 
like cooling down a bit.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;, Mia said playfully.

&quot;I never said I wouldn&#39;t come,&quot; Arine told her. She pulled off her shirt 
and undid her bra. Mia made no effort to hide her appreciation of the 
view. Arine took off her skirt and sandals, then looked up at Mia with 
an innocent expression and pulled her panties down. She stopped just 
before she bared anything more than a bit of beautiful blonde hair, then 
smiled at Mia and bent to take her swimsuit out of the basket. Mia 
choked on a breath she hadn&#39;t known she was holding.

&quot;What is it?&quot;, Arine asked her with a sweet smile.

&quot;That&#39;s not fair,&quot; Mia stammered. &quot;Stopping right before... Hey, you 
aren&#39;t allowed to wear a swimsuit.&quot;

&quot;Are you planning to set the ocean to the boil or something?&quot;, Arine 
asked her with a teasing smile and pulled her panties off with a 
slightly unnecessary sway of the hips. &quot;I said I wanted to cool down you 
know.&quot;

Mia couldn&#39;t say much to that. The ocean might really catch fire if the 
temperature of her ears was any indication. Watching Arine pull on her 
swimsuit was strangely captivating, too. Mia could spend the whole day 
looking at her. The feeling of her notions of beauty and sexuality 
changing in her head, of new fantasies tugging at her imagination, was 
something so new that it made her body shiver with anticipation. She 
didn&#39;t really want to think about more than looking at Arine yet, maybe 
about touching her breasts. She didn&#39;t know what would happen if she let 
her imagination wander loose.

&quot;Awww, that&#39;s so sweet,&quot; Arine said. Mia blinked.

&quot;What were you thinking about?&quot;, Arine asked her with a smile. &quot;You 
looked so cute, standing there naked and looking so deep in thought.&quot;

Mia smiled. &quot;Nothing really.&quot;

Arine frowned at her. &quot;I&#39;m getting second thoughts about coming with 
you, you&#39;re obviously planning something.&quot;

Mia grinned. &quot;If I&#39;m planning something, you can&#39;t avoid it by not 
swimming. Come on!&quot; She dashed into the water followed by Arine. Even 
now the water wasn&#39;t too warm, and the easiest way to get in was to get 
in fast. She splashed into a big wave and shuddered at the coldness as 
she took a few strokes. The waves were always biggest near the shore, 
and if you swam a little bit further they wouldn&#39;t crash over you all 
the time. Arine appeared next to her, her hair wet and her eyes shining 
with the blue of the water and the sky.

&quot;Does the water ever get warm,&quot; Mia asked, panting.

&quot;Not really. It does get a bit warmer still. But you&#39;re trying to divert 
my attention,&quot; Arine said and splashed water at Mia. Mia set her mind to 
soaking the blonde girl as thoroughly as she could, laughing and 
yelling, enjoying the hot sun and the cold water.

             .......

Mia took a bite of her sandwich, examining the small yellow flowers that 
bloomed on the grassy hilltop. The sea wind was gentler here, broken by 
the sandstone crest facing the ocean, and butterflies swirled all 
around. Mia&#39;s skirt had long since dried in the sun. She took a sip from 
her water bottle and glanced at Arine. The yellow-haired girl was lying 
on her back in the grass beside Mia, looking at the cloudless sky, her 
sandwich already gone. Mia smiled. A pair of yellow butterflies passed 
close to her face, spinning around each other playfully.

&quot;You know,&quot; Mia said, &quot;When I was little I used to wonder... how they 
knew if the other butterfly was a girl or a boy, since they look the 
same.&quot; Arine turned her head to look at her, and Mia smiled with a small 
blush. &quot;I didn&#39;t know that it doesn&#39;t really matter.&quot;

Arine gave her a surprised smile and took her hand. &quot;I love it when you 
talk like that,&quot; she said gently. &quot;Do you think of that kind of things a 
lot?&quot;

&quot;Every now and then,&quot; Mia said with her eyes downcast but holding 
Arine&#39;s hand. &quot;More after I met you.&quot; Arine caressed the back of her 
hand with her thumb, and Mia raised her eyes to see a loving smile.

&quot;You sweet thing,&quot; Arine said and closed her eyes, smiling. Mia squeezed 
her hand for a while, beaming with happiness. She was really in love 
with a girl, and it felt so natural that she could hardly remember a 
time when it would have given her second thoughts. She put the last of 
the sandwich in her mouth, watching the blue and yellow butterflies for 
a while, then dusted her hands and turned to Arine. The blue-eyed girl 
was looking at the sky with a smile. She looked so beautiful, in a white 
shirt unbuttoned to show just a bit of her breasts, lying in the grass. 
Mia lowered herself to press her body gently against Arine, then lay her 
head on Arine&#39;s shoulder and closed her eyes.

&quot;Let&#39;s rest for a while, and then I want to run,&quot; Mia said.

Arine chuckled and smoothed Mia&#39;s hair. &quot;Sure.&quot;

             .......

Mia set her fork down with a contented sigh. She had run and played with 
Arine to her heart&#39;s content, which had made them hungry as wolves, 
which had lead to them deciding to make a huge dinner as soon as they 
got back to Arine&#39;s house. Right now Mia felt like doing nothing for a 
half an hour, preferably in Arine&#39;s lap.

&quot;I&#39;d like to read for a while,&quot; Arine said with a smile and rose from 
the table.

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Mia said and went after Arine to the living room. She sat 
on the sofa while Arine chose a book from the bookshelf.

&quot;Would you like one?&quot;, Arine asked her.

&quot;No thanks,&quot; Mia said. Arine sat down at her side and Mia snuggled into 
her lap, clutching her skirt with her hand. Arine made a pleased sound 
and smoothed Mia&#39;s hair, then opened her book and set to reading, gently 
caressing Mia&#39;s hair and back with her other hand. Mia closed her eyes 
and listened to Arine&#39;s breath, enjoying the warmth and softness of her 
thighs and her gentle touch.

After a good half hour Mia started from near-sleep as Arine shifted her 
position.

&quot;The water is ready,&quot; Arine told her, smoothing her hair. Mia yawned and 
streched, half inclined to lay there like a sack so that Arine could not 
go anywhere, but she was looking forward to washing too. They had put 
fire to the water boiler before they started eating, and it would be 
ready by now. She sat up.

&quot;Would you like to come with me?&quot;, Arine asked her. &quot;Because, there&#39;s no 
reason... not to go together now, is there?&quot;, she said with a smile.

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Mia said. She hadn&#39;t really thought about it, she was so 
used to washing by herself before or after Arine. There was no reason 
not to, and she had already seen Arine naked today, if only for a small 
moment, and yet there was something really arousing in the thought. She 
rose with Arine, her heart beating a bit faster with excitement, feeling 
a bit foolish for it. They went into the bedroom to get their towels and 
change of clothes. Mia already had her own towel here, an adorable pale 
pink one with embroidered red and yellow flowers that Arine had chosen 
for her.

Mia loved the bathroom. The brown and white tiling on the floor, the 
cozy wooden stools and buckets and the reddish brown water heater whose 
paint had flaked a bit around the bottom edge. And the enameled bathtub 
sitting in a corner, big enough for a person to comfortably immerse 
herself in. Arine had told Mia that she would get to bathe in it when 
the cold autumn winds came. Something to look forward, certainly. But 
right now she could not make herself mind the bathtub much. Arine was 
pulling her clothes off and dropping them into a laundry basket, and Mia 
followed her example. Soon she was sitting naked on a low stool, waiting 
while Arine filled two large buckets from the water heater.

Arine lifted one of the buckets to Mia and gave her a piece of soap from 
the small wicker shelf hanging on the wall. Mia took the soap with a 
smile and started washing her hair. Arine sat on the other stool at her 
side.

&quot;I must have a few ounces of sand in my hair after all that playing 
around with you,&quot; Arine said with a chuckle. &quot;You&#39;re quite the happy 
little animal when you get into the mood. I wouldn&#39;t wonder if you 
decided to run around the hills naked some day.&quot;

Mia laughed out loud. As unsubtle as the description was, it did sound 
like her. &quot;And would you like that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d have to see it to know for sure,&quot; Arine said nonchalantly.

&quot;Arine,&quot; Mia said. &quot;Would you like me to wash your back?&quot; She poured 
water on her head with a wooden scoop to wash away the soap, uncertain 
how the other girl would react.

&quot;That would be lovely,&quot; Arine said with a smile.

Mia moved her stool behind her friend and started gently soaping her 
back. Arine gathered her hair over her shoulder to move it out of the 
way. Mia ran her hands over her smooth skin, down her back and up her 
sides, over her hips. Touching her like this felt all too good. She 
moved closer and pressed herself against Arine, sliding her arms gently 
around her.

&quot;Mmm, you feel nice...&quot;, Arine murmured. Mia moved her hand to softly 
circle Arine&#39;s breast with her fingers. At no sign of reluctance from 
Arine, Mia cupped her breast with her hand, gently feeling it. It was 
soft and firm, and she felt shivers of desire along her body. 
Embarrassment suddenly overwhelmed her, and she took her hand away. 
Arine turned around to face her with a gentle smile.

&quot;I...&quot;, Mia stammered, &quot;I wanted to know what they feel like...&quot; Her 
face felt red.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Arine said gently. &quot;You can touch me there.&quot; Mia smiled 
in relief, feeling more than a little embarrassed.

&quot;Would you like me to wash you too?&quot;, Arine asked her.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mia said with a smile. Part of her wanted to to continue what she 
had been doing with Arine&#39;s breasts, but right now neither of them 
seemed to know exactly what they were supposed to do next. She smiled at 
the thought. With Arine it did not matter. She set to enjoying the feel 
of Arine&#39;s hands gently washing her back.

             .......

Mia snuggled between the soft sheets with a sigh of relaxation. After 
rubbing her cheek on the pillow she turned her head to the other side. 
As much of Arine as she had seen today, she still wanted to watch her 
change.

&quot;You&#39;re too fast,&quot; Arine said. &quot;I&#39;d like to watch the display for once.&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Mia said with a playful smile.

&quot;Something really nice and slow too,&quot; Arine said.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Mia said. That would be at least as fun as watching.

Arine put out the candle, then climbed into the bed and took Mia in her 
arms.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I have you,&quot; Mia murmured, holding Arine tight. She 
found Arine&#39;s lips with hers and buried herself in the softness of her 
friend&#39;s embrace.

             .......

After the sun had set and Arine&#39;s breaths had taken on the peacefulness 
of sleep, Mia lay thinking about everything they had done today. When 
they kissed for the first time she had thought there would be no more 
wondering what the other one thought, or felt. For some things it was 
true, but... for most, she didn&#39;t know what Arine wanted and how she 
would react. There were a thousand things about their relationship that 
could only be found out by trying them. She was helplessly unsure what 
Arine read into all the playful undressing and teasing, and only vaguely 
certain what she thought about it herself.

She put her arm around Arine, careful not to wake her. Her scent of her 
hair and the soft sound of her breath made Mia shiver with happiness. 
She loved Arine, and she loved the uncertainty. Every time she found out 
something new about Arine&#39;s world and about herself was wonderful.
