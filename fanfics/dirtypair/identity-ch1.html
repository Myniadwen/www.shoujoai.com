<h1>After the Fire: Identity</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dirtypair/index.html">Dirty Pair</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrtines.html">Mr. Tines</a><br> </h2>
<pre>After absence, awareness returns. I have awoken. Just enough &#39;I&#39; that 
it can monitor itself. I know this is not the first time I have awoken 
- there is enough baggage along with this &#39;I&#39; to form concepts to talk 
about reflexive self-awareness. But an &#39;I&#39; with a nagging sense of 
incompleteness.

Proprioception data, both natural and augmented, filter up into 
consciousness. I&#39;m loosely curled up in a bed. There is some discomfort 
down my front, more diffuse across my whole torso, and also in my left 
hand, but nothing that registers as significant damage.

All this has taken milliseconds, and normal wakefulness sweeps away the 
almost ego-free moment. The first thing that comes to mind is that I 
don&#39;t have anything I simply _have_ to do - I just have to stay here, 
amuse myself and recuperate. And then that it&#39;s more than just another 
day of recuperation. _She_ will be returning - should be returning - 
today.

I wonder if I&#39;ll be able to look her in the face.

But who is this I that asks the question? Is it the same old polite 
fiction that it feels to itself like it is? Or is it a just a clever 
counterfeit? Or is it some new forged synthesis? And if the last, is 
that just the same kind of new synthesis that awakens each morning, or 
is it something stranger?

I remember... and that&#39;s where the problems begin again. I remember the 
last few days, mainly dozing, not entirely awake, knowing I&#39;d been hurt 
badly, but that the worst was over now. Reaching back further, I seek 
to reassure my sense of continuity by lighting on a few salient events 
from the past. From childhood, a memory wells up of when I was about 
ten, when I fell and scraped one leg badly. Why does that memory come 
flooding forth ahead of others to define me to myself? From a few years 
later, a row with my father about the company I was keeping at Mezuiru, 
the first time she came home with me. That one is not surprising. More 
recent still, other times I&#39;d woken up in a hospital bed, like when 
Shasti had succumbed to her five-way split personality, which my 
current situation echoes in ways I don&#39;t care to dwell upon. But in 
between, in the near past, something I don&#39;t want to remember, but 
remember almost too well.

I remember that I&#39;ve done something terrible. At least, I think it was 
me, or at least one of the strands that make up this tentative self. I 
remember the culmination of the PR drive, after talk shows (mixed), 
meet the people town hall style meetings (dubious at best) and, finally 
, attending a convention in our honour. And then memory goes into 
double vision, and all sense of self completely fails to cohere. All 
that I consistently remember is trying to kill myself, another 
externalised person, I swear, physical, occupying space, and what 
started as a cat-fight escalated into Armageddon.

Where had I found out about supernova triggering via gamma-ray laser? I 
don&#39;t remember reading or hearing about it before, but I remember 
remembering about it on one of the narratives that culminate in the 
now. Remember - though I would give anything not to - I remember doing 
just that. Does that act define this &#39;I&#39;, define it as astrocide?

I&#39;ve killed before, by design, and by accident - even if we have been 
cleared of blame in every case to date. But even if they weren&#39;t 
currently disfigured, these white hands that I can feel in front of my 
face would be stained with blood. This - this, however, was overkill, 
more even than she would do. This guilt is all mine.

I gather I succeeded. Or maybe I simply had to kill myself in self 
defense. Whichever way it is, I seem to have also managed to be absent 
from my own funeral. That&#39;s where _she_ has gone, has been. Even though 
I almost killed her - or maybe because. It&#39;s like another person&#39;s 
memory, a story I heard someone tell, and I&#39;ve confabulated the memory 
of being there, seeing, hearing everything that I&#39;d been told. I 
remember her lying curled up, stunned, looking so helpless, looking so 
... innocent? Is that a word I can validly apply to her? I remember 
looking at her through a haze of pain and more, down the barrel of a 
gun, and I could not pull the trigger. Dare I think, dare I name, what 
gave me pause; what later made me give up my self-destructive struggle 
and release her, to let her carry me away?

I lie here, feigning sleep, but inside, I&#39;m at war with myself again. 
When we are together, she is so overpowering, wild, brash, and won&#39;t 
leave me be, drags me with her on her wild escapades, when I&#39;d rather 
stay in with a glass of wine, a book or some music, and at times like 
those I feel I want never to see her again - but now when we are apart, 
I feel her absence as an ache, a craving I have to fulfill, an 
addiction I must feed. I wonder, sometimes. Those flashes of insight we 
have together, when we get angry enough - which way round is the 
causation? Or do both stem from some common cause, that makes it feel 
that we each get under the other&#39;s skin, when we are somehow combining 
forces, leaving us prone to friction together, but almost numbed when 
apart?

After all these years being together, it has become habit, the way life 
is, the sort of thing you don&#39;t analyze simply because it is the norm. 
Do I define myself in contrast to her, define myself as the quiet, shy, 
introverted one?

I&#39;m disturbed from reverie by the door opening.

&quot;Rise and shine, sleepyhead. you have a visitor waiting. she&#39;ll be 
along just as soon as you&#39;ve had your breakfast.&quot; The medic is the same 
remorselessly cheery chap, silver haired, affecting steel-rimmed 
glasses, distinguished, who described what he&#39;d had to do to me as 
&quot;Giving you a new set of giblets, my dear.&quot;

He &quot;tut-tut&quot;s and &quot;aha&quot;s to himself as he checks the readings from the 
bed - he could have done it from his office, but we get personal 
attention here - it&#39;s part of the treatment. Having read all the 
monitors, and reached a decision, he tells me nothing I didn&#39;t already 
know - that I&#39;m well enough to be discharged; or, in my case, to have 
the last bit of restorative, cosmetic, work done.

The ward mech delivers me my breakfast. I can smell things that should 
be appetizing, but I&#39;m too tense, apprehensive, struck with stage 
fright, to have an appetite. But it is fuel, and my body asserts the 
need for it, so I eat, mechanically, glad that I&#39;m not so far gone that 
the idea of eating, the smell of food, disgusts me.

What will she have to say to me, to tell me? I realise a new scope for 
disaster - they took my remains back home for burial. That means it 
will have been the first time she and my parents will have met without 
my being there to try and mediate. For a moment, I am horrified; and 
then I&#39;m just confused. I&#39;m worried about her, how she will have been 
feeling, how everyone will have reacted, what they think about me. I 
want this turmoil to be over, I want to sail out into calm waters 
again, to hit the fast-forward for 24 hours so this will only be 
memory.

I want so much to have her back again, despite all the scratchy words 
we have spoken. She is part of me - no, I am part of - no, we fit 
together as something. Without her, I am incomplete, and I fear her 
turning me away.

I realise I have finished eating, and the tray has been whisked away. 
I&#39;m wound up tight like a spring, waiting for the on-coming train of 
the future to arrive.

&quot;Uh,...Hello?&quot;

Her voice at the open door, though I&#39;ve heard no footsteps. I nearly 
scream - but I don&#39;t know what I would have screamed. &quot;I missed you 
so!&quot;, &quot;Go away! Leave me alone!&quot;, an inarticulate squeak, they all log-
jam before I can voice any of them.

&quot;K-Kei! Come, come in,&quot; I stammer, when I regain some control of my 
larynx.

I raise a weak grin as I see her - she&#39;s still using her GM pack, 
though her leg is at last out of its cast, but otherwise is in civvies. 
She&#39;s looking pretty worn, too. There&#39;s some tension she&#39;s trying to 
hide from me. I guess she must be nervous, too, though she&#39;s trying her 
usual approach of toughing it out. It&#39;s like we&#39;d never met before, and 
that frightens me. We&#39;re both being wary of the other&#39;s reaction, 
circling for position. In my deepest heart I know that we have never 
truly met before, that this is the new flesh I am wearing, and that 
fact alone might define me to her, define me as another.

&quot;Uh, hi ... I thought you&#39;d like - I thought I&#39;d show you...&quot; She&#39;s 
never good with tactful words, &quot;There&#39;s a hypercam. In the security 
system. Oh, for goodness sake, just look!&quot;

And she switches on the room holofield system, shows me a view of a 
domed city. I recognise landmarks. It is - was - my home, the home of 
my childhood memories. And in the foreground, there&#39;s a gravestone with 
my picture on it, and not even a very flattering one. I should be glad 
that it&#39;s not been vandalised, or turned into some sick sort of shrine, 
or simply buried under flowers and soft toys. But it&#39;s not that which I 
fasten on - it&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s the sort of kitsch I&#39;m certain my 
parents were behind, not the plain discreet black slab with just carved 
name, version and dates that I would have chosen for myself.

I can tell it&#39;s been days since I&#39;ve really spoken to a person. I start 
to babble about my own memorial stone, and then about how I would have 
liked to have been well enough to be there for the funeral, if that 
would not have worried people, while Kei kneels in mid-air beside me, 
listening patiently. When I run out of steam, she starts to tell me 
about the funeral, but she stumbles over her words. Normally, I 
wouldn&#39;t mark her as sentimental, but she sounds choked. I see tears 
starting in her eyes, and the tension now evident in her whole posture, 
as she speaks about how the mourners thought well of me. She&#39;s no 
longer even _trying_ to mask anything.

I feel the blood rushing to my face, as I read the sincerity in what 
she is saying. She does care, more than she says, more, I think, than 
she might admit to herself. I feel a weight lifted, a great sense of 
relief, start to tell her how grateful I am. But there is more I must 
say before we go any further.

I have to bare my self to her, literally and figuratively, even though 
I should trust her, not put her to any test. But I have to show her 
that I am not the one she remembers, that I instead am damaged goods, 
not yet renovated, covered in the graffiti that I took on in a madness 
that I can remember, but no longer comprehend. I roll back one sleeve 
of my gown, force myself to look at what I had done, show her, tell 
her.

I can feel her hovering close, almost close enough to feel the warmth 
of her body. She has not drawn away in horror or disgust. I want to 
tell her to hold me, I want to bury my face in her breasts and weep, 
but my voice won&#39;t obey me, and I am too timid to act.

I feel strong arms around me, hear her voice murmuring soft words of 
endearment as she gathers me to herself. I nuzzle down into the 
welcoming softness, and I&#39;m crying floods into her top. And I don&#39;t 
know now why I am crying, whether I&#39;m happy or sad, or just for relief 
at a burden shed at last.

&quot;Hush, hush, now, little flower,&quot; she says. I can hear her heart 
beating, strong, a measured pace. It&#39;s like I was small again, my 
mother comforting me, even the same secret name. But I can no longer 
define myself as the child of those I remember as my parents. That one, 
they buried. Perhaps these tears are also my way of mourning for that 
other me.

&quot;Hush, hush,&quot; she rocks me gently, one hand tangled in my hair, the 
other gently stroking my back, as I ride the crying fit to its end. 
Only when at last I stop sobbing, and begin to get my breathing back 
under control, she relaxes her hold, letting me look up, look into her 
face. I know I must look a frightful state, eyes bloodshot, all the 
mess associated with a good bawling. As I blink my eyes clear, I can 
see that she too has been crying - or rather, doing her level best not 
to. She has that determined set to her jaw, but there are streaks down 
from the corners of her eyes. Of course that is what she would have 
done, the way she&#39;s too stubborn to fail at things, just one of the 
things that I... Even now I can&#39;t quite bring myself to think the word.

&quot;Of course I came back, you silly,&quot; she says, her voice even huskier 
than usual, &quot;I... we...&quot; She cannot frame the sentences. But things 
have gone too far for me to want to turn back now, and I can read the 
intention that she could not utter, read it in her posture, even in the 
movements of her eyes. I have to be brave, have to say what has to be 
said here, now, in this room, before the moment passes.

&quot;I love you too, Kei. I guess I always have. I was just too scared to 
say it before.&quot;

A series of emotions - shock, delight, relief - sweep across her face, 
and I feel the tension flow away from her. She curls herself around me, 
buries her face in my hair, and howls. The arms holding me shake and 
shudder. I&#39;ve never seen her cry before, but now it comes, I am not 
surprised. She cries like she does everything else, loudly, without 
restraint. I want to hold her, comfort her, but she&#39;s clinging to me as 
if her life depended on it. All I can do is be here, but I understand 
that that is all she needs from me for the moment.

The storm passes. For a while after, she continues to cling to me, 
breathing heavily into my hair, then lifts her head again.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she says, &quot;What a mess. I&#39;m sorry. I so nearly lost you. 
I...&quot;

For a moment, I think she&#39;s about to start crying again, her voice 
fading raggedly, and then I feel her taking long deep breaths as she 
fights it. Held close, I can feel the strength in her, and it makes a 
strange thrill that swells in my chest, almost choking me. She - I - I 
cannot believe my luck, the joy I feel.

She loosens her desperate grasp, slides her hands down my arms, takes 
my hands in hers, and looks into my eyes. She looks just as much of a 
mess as I feel. She flashes me her usual defiant grin, and then looks 
serious again.

&quot;You mustn&#39;t die again, not until you can get backed up. Not now, not 
now.&quot;

There is such fierceness in her, such intensity, like something that 
had always been there, but slumbering, and has now awoken. She is like 
a lioness. If I am now her little flower, what is she to me? Is she my 
Warrior? No, not quite. Examples come to me from history, to tell me 
what this is.

&quot;Not while you are there to protect me,&quot; I promise her, &quot;my Spartan, my 
Immortal.&quot;

She nods, pauses, speaks again.

&quot;You&#39;ve always been like the big sister I never had - a bit boring and 
stick in the mud, but not in a bad way.&quot;

I&#39;m actually a few months younger than she is, but growing up on a bush 
station in the Dooloomai country on Niogi, she didn&#39;t have many female 
role models. And that last qualification, and counter-qualification, is 
just, just so her, the Kei I&#39;ve always known and, yes, loved, not that 
new, almost frightening, facet of herself that she&#39;s only just now 
shown me, that overpowers me, so I could only surrender to her.

Then she lowers her head, lowers her voice. I could never have imagined 
seeing her looking bashful, but she is.

&quot;But when I saw you... I know we&#39;ve had some close calls before, but 
now, when I thought I was going to lose you forever... Times when we&#39;ve 
been parted before, I&#39;ve known, I&#39;ve felt it here&quot; - she lets go one 
hand, slams her fist against her breastbone - &quot;I can&#39;t live without 
you. You keep me grounded, keep me from spiralling out of control. I 
never hoped...

&quot;Is it wrong, Yuri? When I saw you at the funeral, it felt like I had 
to defend what was left of my family, my... But you know how I am with 
kids, and you, me, we can&#39;t be... You aren&#39;t that much younger than me, 
damn it.&quot;

She looks up at me, uncertain.

&quot;Love me as you love me,&quot; I tell her. The word I could hardly even 
think before now comes naturally to my lips. I savour the moment, 
knowing that we are only post-human, that this intensity cannot be 
sustained. &quot;And I am yours, my love.&quot;

She reaches out one hesitant hand, strokes my cheek, then holds me to 
her again, and I put my arms around her, and we are both lying tangled 
on the bed. There is another step we could take, life asserting itself 
in the aftermath of death, but it isn&#39;t necessary, though I would for 
her. We have each other to cling to, to feel. hear, see and smell, to 
be real and comforting and present, and for the moment that is all we 
need.

As I start to drift off back into a doze, here in my love&#39;s embrace, as 
this &#39;I&#39; starts to unravel into sleep, the answer is made clear.

&#39;I&#39; am part of &#39;us&#39;.
