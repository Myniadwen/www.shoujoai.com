<h1>A Good Night</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dirtypair/index.html">Dirty Pair</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rann.html">Rann Aridorn</a><br> </h2>
<pre>I lie here, her arms around me, and it&#39;s both more than I ever dared 
hope for, and everything I ever wanted. To feel her holding me, her 
skin against mine, to feel the wetness of our passion turning cool as 
we both supposedly sleep. I may not be back to full strength, but I 
think I gave a fair account of myself. I hope I did. What if she had 
to fake it? I don&#39;t think she did... I don&#39;t think Kei would ever fake 
something like... that.

The doctors would probably be ticked off if they knew I&#39;d started 
making love to someone the day I left the hospital and how much energy 
we&#39;d put into it for... geez, what day is it, now?... but then, 
they&#39;re not the ones that thought their unrequited love had died, and 
then had samesaid love walk in and be requited. Er, or something like 
that. However that works.

Well, I *AM* staying in bed, like they told me!

But I&#39;m not sleeping, any more than I was when we were making love. I 
feel Kei&#39;s every breath rustling my hair and touching my skin, and I 
wonder... does she really love me? Is it just... pity, or duty? I 
mean, the way I was when she found me... dehydrated, starved, barely 
able to move... what if she just said it so I wouldn&#39;t die on her? Or 
&#39;cause she felt guilty?

For that matter... can I be sure I really love her? That it isn&#39;t 
guilt, or...?

When she was gone... it seemed so easy to pick out each and every 
little thing that made me love her. The whys, and hows, and every 
moment where I loved her even more. But now... with her here, so 
close... those whys and hows seem misty, they don&#39;t wanna come to me. 
And instead of just lying here, loving her as she holds me, I&#39;m 
thinking all this.

She&#39;s the first woman I&#39;ve ever been with. Was I good? Was I the first 
woman she&#39;d ever been with? Was I the first PERSON she&#39;s ever been 
with? I don&#39;t think I was. I mean, I think I may&#39;ve been the first 
woman. But maybe I wasn&#39;t. Heck, maybe she&#39;s just never been with a 
GUY.

... Am I butch, or something?

Noooo, I really don&#39;t think that&#39;s it. If either of us is the &quot;man&quot;, I 
think it&#39;d have to be Kei. Just because she&#39;s kinda, well, macho. Not 
in a BAD way, really. I think. I don&#39;t even KNOW what I think.

You know what? I don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t care about ANY of it. I love Kei, 
and Kei loves me. What more do I need to know than that?

&quot;Kei...?&quot;

&quot;Mmm...&quot; The redhead stirred slightly, her shock of blonde hair 
intermingling with the dark purple of Yuri&#39;s own hair. &quot;What is it, 
baby...?&quot;

Yuri&#39;s cheeks colored slightly. She turned her head a little to look 
over her shoulder at slitted-open green eyes. &quot;I love you, Kei. I 
really do.&quot;

A small, tired smile touched Kei&#39;s lips, and she raised her head to 
kiss Yuri&#39;s cheek. &quot;I know. I love you, too. Really. Now, you should 
actually get some sleep, like the doctors said, &#39;kay?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Kay,&quot; Yuri whispered back, letting her head rest again, snuggling 
closer back against her partner. Soon, real sleep had claimed her, a 
dreamless sleep, but not a sensationless one, for she could still feel 
Kei&#39;s warmth and presence.

Could stay awake forever an&#39; watch her sleep, I think. She just looks 
so perfect... that purple hair, that pale skin... innocent little 
face. Hell, I know what that innocent-lookin&#39; little mouth can DO, but 
the way she looks now, even I have trouble believin&#39; it. An&#39; even 
though we&#39;re both around the same height, me maybe a little shorter, 
she looks so small this way... spooned back against me, like she just 
wanted ta pull me around her an&#39; use me as a blanket.

For so long, I was afraid to even friggin&#39; look at her. Just knowin&#39; 
she was with me, it made my stomach do flipflops. I had to try an&#39; 
ignore it just to get my job done. And that made me mad. Then I 
realized that me bein&#39; mad made HER mad. Kept her at a distance. That 
hurt like hell, but it also made it easier, somehow. So I was just mad 
all the time.

I dunno... I mean, if I had handled stuff better, maybe things 
wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve gotten so bad. I mean, dammit, if I&#39;d taken a bit more 
time walkin&#39; from her front door to her bedroom... I&#39;d&#39;ve lost Yuri 
forever. I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;d&#39;ve done, then. I might&#39;ve picked 
up my snub-nose and followed her. I mean, I ain&#39;t the sort to think 
about that kinda thing, but walkin&#39; in and being just too late... an&#39; 
the only woman I ever REALLY loved, lyin&#39; there with a blaster burn in 
her? I dunno... I can&#39;t see ever goin&#39; on, after that, despite all 
that stuff I told her.

Look at &#39;er. Still beautiful, still vital... but what she went through 
still shows on &#39;er. She&#39;ll be alright now, I guess... but I never 
thought I&#39;d worry so much about someone. I mean, like I do with her. 
It makes me think of... damn, of stuff I NEVER thought I&#39;d be 
considerin&#39; in a million years. Settlin&#39; down. Maybe actually 
havin&#39;... kids. Damn, that&#39;s a fuckin&#39; scary thought! But I can&#39;t help 
but wonder...

Thank God me&#39;n&#39;Yuri are here on Earth. Out in the colonies where we 
were born, this stuff ain&#39;t encouraged. Hell, here, it&#39;s practically 
typical. And with all the cloning and stuff, we could actually HAVE 
kids. Kids! Me! Aw, hell no, there&#39;s no WAY *I&#39;M* gonna give birth! If 
we EVER decide ta do that, I gotta figure out how to get Yuri to 
handle THAT end.

I guess that&#39;s thinkin&#39; too far ahead... really, do I need any more 
than that she&#39;s right here, with me? An&#39; I&#39;m holding her, bein&#39; with 
her? Hell no. That&#39;s enough for this backwater girl.

&quot;Hey... Yuri...?&quot;

&quot;Mmm...?&quot;

&quot;You awake...?&quot;

&quot;Mmm-hmmm...&quot;

&quot;... Wanna fool around some more...?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; *giggle* &quot;Okay...&quot;

~Fin... for now ^_~
