<h1>Night Angels (part 9 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gunsmith/index.html">Gunsmith Cats</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gunsmith/niteangel-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;...And that&#39;s just about the long-and-short about it,&quot; Irene &quot;Rally&quot; 
Vincent concluded to Alucard, sitting near the old vampire. &quot;I 
blacked-out for a few seconds. The next thing I knew, my head and the 
rest of my body felt like someone stuck a power cord up my ass and 
plugged it in. I later find out from Integra that I had assaulted Master 
and tried to bite her in the neck!&quot; She set down the wine glass after 
finishing it. &quot;This is so unreal! I don&#39;t want to hurt her, but when I 
get near Master, I feel this... odd compulsion to sink my fangs into her 
neck and drink her blood! I&#39;m not certain if this is some phase or I&#39;m 
just going crazy!&quot;

The No-Life King took this all in, sitting on his throne while carefully 
listening to every word the distressed vampire had related to him. 
&quot;Interesting that you felt this sensation only in the presence of Seras 
Victoria and not around the other humans in this mansion,&quot; he said. &quot;You 
were even in very close proximity to that idiot Pip and Miss Hedgley and 
it didn&#39;t happen around them. Well, I think that it is safe to say that 
you&#39;re not a danger to the humans around here.&quot;

&quot;But why only around Master do I feel it, that&#39;s what I want to know! 
Alucard, if you know something about this, please tell me!&quot; Rally 
pleaded.

&quot;Calm yourself, Rally Vincent,&quot; Alucard said, a note of authority in his 
voice. &quot;If you are worried about harming your master Seras, I can assure 
you that it is not possible. And as for your current condition... I 
believe I might have an idea what it is.&quot;

Rally felt herself brighten up at the news. &quot;Well what are we waiting 
for?&quot; she chirped, &quot;I want to get this over with, so let&#39;s go!&quot;

&quot;Not so fast,&quot; Alucard countered as he got up from his throne, 
disappointing Rally. &quot;I still have to make my report about your 
condition to Sir Integra, then I have to discuss this with Seras before 
we can resolve this situation.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; the dark-haired vampire sputtered, but before she could say 
anything, Alucard had disappeared from sight, leaving Rally to stare 
into the space where he once stood.

However, his voice did make its appearance once more with, &quot;And by the 
way, if you&#39;re still tempted to lock yourself away, like you begged Sir 
Integra to do, I would highly reconsider it. It&#39;s just a long, hungry 
imprisonment, not to mention boring as hell.&quot;

&quot;ALUCARD!? PLEASE TELL ME WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME!!&quot; Rally pleaded, only 
to get silence in return. Finding no answer, she clenched her fists and 
shouted angrily into the air, &quot;GRRRRRR.... ALUCARD, YOU BIG FUCKING 
ASSHOLE!!&quot;

SIR INTEGRA&#39;S OFFICE, HELLSING MANSION...

&quot;Is THAT what is really wrong with Rally?&quot; Sir Integra Fairbrook 
Wingates Hellsing replied, sitting at her desk. &quot;Well, I am certain that 
she found it a relief once she heard the news,&quot; she said with a sense of 
relief. &quot;Now maybe she can calm down from all this excitement she was 
experiencing.&quot;

&quot;Oh I haven&#39;t told Rally, Sir Integra,&quot; Alucard said, standing in front 
of her desk as he made his report.

&quot;YOU HAVE NOT TOLD HER?!&quot; the Hellsing leader exploded, about to bring a 
considerable amount of wrath upon her servant.

The No-Life King held up his hand. &quot;Please, allow me a moment. If you&#39;re 
concerned about Rally experiencing another of her spells, I can assure 
you that the disciplinary burst the Police Girl gave the last time her 
should be enough to suppress any more outbursts - at least for the time 
being.&quot;

&quot;Still, the fact you have not told her what is wrong is not acceptable!&quot; 
Sir Integra countered. &quot;Just exactly WHEN are you going to do that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Alucard plainly told her. &quot;Now before you engage in another 
of your childish outbursts, I am going to brief Seras about the whole 
thing. Besides, being Rally&#39;s master, I feel it is her place to inform 
her fledgling, not me.&quot;

For a few seconds, Sir Integra just glared at Alucard, angry at the fact 
that her servant is forcing Rally to endure more anguish. However, she 
did know he was right; it must be Seras that will tell her. &quot;Very well, 
you may proceed with your plan.&quot;

Alucard grinned evilly, &quot;I knew you would see it my way,&quot; he purred.

Sir Integra just sighed, but then said, &quot;If you say so. By the way, I 
was wondering about the other matter regarding Rally.&quot;

&quot;You mean the proposal the Knights of the Round Table have in mind for 
her? I think she&#39;ll be perfect,&quot; said Alucard, still grinning. &quot;I cannot 
wait to see how she accomplishes it.&quot;

&quot;You would say that,&quot; Sir Integra answered, rather glumly. &quot;Anyway, just 
when are you going to brief Seras about the first part?&quot;

&quot;Not long, I imagine,&quot; the No-Life King said. &quot;And now, I believe we 
should be expecting Seras just about...&quot;

At that moment, the Draculina entered the office, walking though the 
doors rather than opening them. &quot;Pardon me for the intrusion, Sir 
Integra,&quot; she began, obviously wearing a new uniform top, the previous 
one torn by Rally, &quot;but Master told me he needed my presence.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I do,&quot; Alucard said. &quot;Police Girl, I believe we should take a 
walk right about now.&quot; Turning to Sir Integra, he added, &quot;I need to 
leave these premises in order to accomplish this. Is this allowable?&quot;

&quot;Of course, Alucard,&quot; the Hellsing leader said, &quot;provided I can call 
upon the both of you in case trouble occurs.&quot;

&quot;A walk?&quot; Seras quipped. &quot;But where?&quot;

The No-Life King looked up to the ceiling, then said, &quot;Oh... how about 
investigating the scene of that last ghoul attack for one. The rains are 
gone and I believe we might find some clues about the vampire that 
created them.&quot;

&quot;By all means, Alucard, you and Seras may do so, but I seriously doubt 
any will be found,&quot; Sir Integra said. As the red-clad vampire faded from 
sight, Seras saluted and turned for the door. &quot;And Seras?&quot; she added.

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; the yellow-clad vampire asked.

Sir Integra then eyed Seras closely, &quot;Alucard is going to tell some 
facts he found about what is afflicting Rally. It would be valuable if 
you listened.&quot;

The Draculina thought for a bit. &quot;I guess,&quot; she finally said. &quot;And then 
afterward, I think I better apologize for hurting her the way I did.&quot;

&quot;If you ask me, Seras,&quot; Sir Integra offered, &quot;I believe you may have 
done Rally a favor doing so.&quot; Seras just nodded as she walked out of the 
office.

OUTSIDE A TOWER FLAT, WEST LONDON, EVENING...

Legs cramping from standing too long, Elysse Morse somehow managed to 
get home with her purchases for the evening. &quot;Damned bloody grocer,&quot; she 
grumbled to herself, &quot;he could&#39;ve told that woman not to be too 
demanding about the price of that item, but no... he had to acquiesce to 
her demands and do a price check. And about how slow the other lines 
were... it&#39;s lucky there aren&#39;t any closer stores or I would&#39;ve taken my 
business elsewhere!&quot; She began to look through her billfold, &quot;At least I 
have enough money to pay Jenn, plus more for the extra time.&quot;

She was about to enter the door when a taxi drove up in front of it. 
After paying the cabbie, a young brunette woman exited the cab. &quot;Oh, 
Mrs. Morse, good evening,&quot; she said, recognizing the other woman.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you, Miss Hedgley,&quot; Elysse said, also recognizing the 
newcomer.

&quot;Oh please, it&#39;s Moria, I&#39;ve told you many times,&quot; Moria Hedgley said, 
paying the cabbie and going to the building&#39;s entrance. &quot;I see you&#39;ve 
been to the store.&quot;

&quot;More like camped-out there, if the time I spent in line is any 
indication,&quot; Elysse added irritably, entering at the same time Moria 
did. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe the number of people there with purchases 
that needed price checks. I wish they would take the time to go to a 
small market. Come to think of it, maybe I should&#39;ve done so myself,&quot; 
she remarked as she called the elevator car.

&quot;Don&#39;t give it too much thought,&quot; Moria laughed as the doors opened.

The two women entered the car, then called for the seventh floor. As the 
car made its assent, Moria decided to break the silence with, &quot;I&#39;ve 
gotten an extra day from my employer today - with pay. I guess I might 
drop by to visit you and Harold this weekend.&quot;

&quot;You seem very lucky to have such a generous boss,&quot; Elysse said.

&quot;I guess,&quot; sighed Moria, who added mentally, &#39;More like understanding, 
having to contend with a certain lesbian vampire that has taken a rather 
abnormal fancy towards me. If I ever told her who I have to work with, 
she might think I was bonkers.&#39;

Quite suddenly, though, the car stopped with a lurch, followed with the 
overhead lights going off, then the emergency lights coming on. &quot;Oh 
dear,&quot; Elysse fretted, &quot;it seems that the lift&#39;s broken down again.&quot;

Moria just shook her head, grumbling sourly, &quot;More like those idiots in 
Maintenance seems to be slacking off again, if you ask me. This is the 
fourth time this month! I swear, I have a half-of-a-mind to have the 
lease on my flat broken and move out of here!&quot;

&quot;Now don&#39;t make such a fuss,&quot; Elysse reassured, going for the emergency 
phone, &quot;I&#39;m certain it&#39;s nothing.&quot; However, when she placed her ear to 
the receiver, she made a strange face. &quot;Now that&#39;s odd,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m 
not getting a reply.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like those stupid blokes in the basement had the phone shut off 
so they won&#39;t have their damned football game on the telly interrupted 
to help us,&quot; Moria snarled. Going to her handbag, she pulled out a small 
prying bar. &quot;Might as well see if we can help ourselves.&quot;

&quot;Are you certain about this?&quot; Elysse said, looking with concern as Moria 
began to work the door. &quot;I&#39;m certain it&#39;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not leaving my fate to a bunch of idiots drunk on ale to get me out 
of a lift car,&quot; the brunette said, still working the door. &quot;It was 
something my late grandfather said: &#39;Sometimes you are the only solution 
to your problems&#39;.&quot; Moria then managed to open the door part-way, then 
peered inside. &quot;I think we may be in luck; seems we&#39;re not between 
floors. Elysse, could you help me part these doors? There seems to be 
about five centimeters of clearance between the car and the floor. We&#39;ll 
pull them apart, then I&#39;ll try to get the others open and find ourselves 
out of here.&quot;

Putting down her bag, Elysse then assisted Moria with the door. &quot;I still 
think it&#39;s nothing,&quot; she grumbled.

XXX

BOUROUGH OF ENFIELD, LONDON, EVENING...

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me, Master!&quot; Seras gasped. &quot;Is such a thing 
possible?&quot;

&quot;It is, although it is quite rare,&quot; Alucard answered, looking around in 
the alley where they had battled ghouls the previous night. &quot;It seems 
that Rally&#39;s body has decided it is time she became a free vampire, so 
it has taken upon itself to free itself.&quot;

&quot;But I thought it was up to me to determine if Rally is ready,&quot; the 
Draculina countered.

The No-Life King paused. &quot;Well, yes it is,&quot; he said. &quot;Usually, the 
master observes his or her fledgling, assesses his or her&#39;s skills, then 
through their judgment, makes the decision to do so.&quot; He then placed his 
hands in a contemplative position and added, &quot;However, there are 
certain... instances when a fledgling vampire has achieved certain 
plateaus in their education, as well as what they had learned while 
human, that their bodies seem to sense that they are ready to ascend to 
becoming true undead and then act upon it, usually without their will.&quot;

Alucard then paused again, adding, &quot;Of course, this is very rare, almost 
unknown; I only have observed several instances of this odd behavior 
personally. But from whatever I have seen, it is always very chaotic - 
fledglings often taking upon themselves securing their freedom... and in 
the process, almost destroying themselves and their masters. Seras, I 
believe that, because of her strong feelings towards you - I think the 
humans describes this as &#39;love&#39; - that Rally had restrained herself to 
the degree she had achieved, and not wishing to harm you, she had only 
acerbated the problem she faces. &quot;

&quot;That seems so odd,&quot; Seras observed. &quot;And this is what caused this in 
Rally?&quot;

&quot;I believe it so,&quot; Alucard said, looking at one particular corner. &quot;She 
had achieved the necessary skills long before her turning. In fact, I it 
is my belief that it was because she had accepted her circumstances 
better than you that had brought this about.&quot; He then looked at Seras 
and added, &quot;Incidentally, I was wondering about YOUR assessment on 
Rally&#39;s progress. Do you have anything you wish to say about it.&quot;

Seras thought for a minute. &quot;Now that you&#39;ve mentioned it, Master,&quot; she 
began, &quot;Rally has been progressing well for the last few months. I was 
contemplating asking Sir Integra about the possibility of freeing her. I 
know this is my opinion, but I would rather work with Rally as an equal, 
not as her master.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t really have to have our master&#39;s permission, Seras,&quot; the 
red-clad nosferatu quoted. &quot;I didn&#39;t ask it when I freed you back in 
Aurora.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Seras replied, scratching the back of her head. She then 
added, &quot;What about YOUR opinion, Master? Do you think Rally is ready?&quot;

&quot;I believe Rally is more than ready,&quot; Alucard declared. &quot;She has the 
mental discipline not to allow herself to go on a rampage to get her 
blood - unlike one vampire I know.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about, Master?&quot; the Draculina asked.

The pause was brief before Alucard had spoken. &quot;Sometime around three 
hundred years ago, there was this... particular vampire that was 
created. Although she had great potential, much like Rally, she lacked 
the restraint your fledgling has. You could say that, in a way, she had 
lacked the maturity to be a proper vampire.&quot;

Seras stood amazed. &quot;Did you ever fight her?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Oh, about once or twice, I&#39;m really uncertain. She always gotten away, 
though, then I wouldn&#39;t hear from her for a span of years - until she 
decides to go on a rampage.&quot; Alucard then thought for a time. &quot;Come to 
think of it,&quot; he mused, &quot;this little caper last night would be her 
trademark... but she wasn&#39;t to be found.&quot;

&quot;Do you think it might be her, this... vampire you talk about?&quot; Seras 
asked further.

&quot;Possibly,&quot; was all he said.

THE TOWER FLAT...

It took some doing, but Moria, with Elysse&#39;s help, managed to open the 
doors to the maid&#39;s floor. The car was only short of level with the 
floor about eight centimeters, so it was an easy matter that the two 
exited. &quot;Hmmm... the corridor&#39;s dark, too,&quot; Moria remarked, noticing the 
halls were only illuminated by emergency lights. &quot;Guess it must be a 
power outage that caused it.&quot;

&quot;If that&#39;s so,&quot; Elysse added, looking at an outside window, &quot;then why is 
the block, not to mention the city, still lit?&quot; Indeed as the two looked 
outside, it was evident that London was still brightly lit.

Moria was amazed. &quot;Something&#39;s off about this situation,&quot; she mumbled. 
&quot;The power is off in here, yet nobody else is.&quot; Thinking quickly, she 
strode to the other end of the hall. &quot;We better find the stairs and get 
out of here. I have a bad feeling about what&#39;s happening here.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Elysse said, only to get silence from 
Moria. However, the two only got so far before they heard an odd 
scraping sound, followed by a horrible odor. &quot;That smell,&quot; Elysse 
gasped, struggling not to vomit, &quot;it&#39;s... it&#39;s like something had died!&quot; 
Then the two caught sight of them - a group of zombie-like beings 
shambling towards them, their eyes shining with an odd purple glow. &quot;OH 
MY GOD!! WHAT... WHAT...?&quot;

&#39;They... they have to be ghouls, like Grandfather talked about!&#39; Moria 
thought, managing to keep herself calm &quot;BACK WHERE WE CAME!!&quot; she called 
out.

The two women then raced back towards the elevator, only to be caught 
in-between another group of ghouls. Thinking quickly, Moria tapped her 
panicked companion&#39;s shoulder. &quot;We better head for my flat,&quot; she said.

To her credit, Elysse didn&#39;t argue, following Moria to her apartment, 
which the two entered. After locking the door, Moria found the 
battery-powered lantern she had hidden in a nearby table. After turning 
it on and setting it down, she pointed to a sofa. &quot;Here,&quot; she said, 
&quot;we&#39;ll use that to barricade the door.&quot; Quickly, the two managed to move 
the heavy sofa in front of the door. With that done, the two found 
chairs and promptly collapsed in them.

&quot;Madness,&quot; Elysse whimpered, still running on adrenaline, &quot;this is 
madness! How in the world did those... those creatures find their way 
inside?&quot;

&quot;One wonders why,&quot; Moria answered back, then thought to herself, &#39;And 
besides, those &#39;creatures&#39; just happen to be our neighbors. I though I 
recognized Mr. Haskins from above this place as one of them.&#39; Deciding 
on her action, she made her way to the phone, only to make a face when 
she placed the receiver to her ear. &quot;Landline&#39;s out, too,&quot; she said. &quot;I 
better use the cellphone.&quot;

&quot;What good can the police do against... them?&quot; Elysse pleaded, then 
settled down. &quot;That poor child,&quot; she mumbled to herself, &quot;she must be 
mad with terror because of this. And what of Jenn - and poor Emma?&quot;

&quot;I believe I might know of someone who might help,&quot; Moria answered as 
she dialed, looking at the picture of her grandfather, Peter Farguson, 
as she did.

HELLSING MANSION, A FEW MINUTES PRIOR...

&quot;Is this information accurate, Walter?&quot; Sir Integra asked, seated at her 
desk as she reviewed a set of files.

Walter C. Dolnez, the Hellsing family butler, nodded. &quot;I had gotten this 
from Sir Townstead, as you requested,&quot; he said. &quot;It seems that, prior to 
Alucard and Miss Victoria&#39;s initial engagement of the ghouls in Enfield, 
a dispatch was made to Scotland Yard, requesting that several constables 
be dispatched to investigate a disturbance in that particular alleyway.&quot;

&quot;That is very... disturbing,&quot; the Hellsing leader said.

&quot;There is more,&quot; Walter added, placing a new file folder on the desk. 
&quot;Earlier today, there was an inquiry by one Harold Morse, a local 
government worker, asking about the whereabouts of the parents of a 
young girl.&quot;

Sir Integra looked curiously at her old friend. &quot;Are you certain, 
Walter?&quot;

&quot;Quite so. It seems that Mr. Morse and his wife were returning from an 
event put on by a family friend,&quot; the butler said. &quot;Oddly, the two were 
drawn to the location of this girl hiding among the rubbish cans in the 
alley, claiming that, and I quote, &#39;monsters had eaten her mother and 
father&#39;. Well, it stands to reason that, the &#39;monsters&#39; she spoke of, 
were the ghouls Alucard, Miss Victoria and Miss Vincent had taken on.&quot;

The pale blonde woman thought for a minute, an odd look in her ice-blue 
eyes. &quot;Something is not right here, Walter,&quot; Sir Integra finally said. 
&quot;Ghouls are naturally attracted to living tissue in order to feed 
themselves. Why in the world would they not find the girl?&quot; She looked 
up at Walter and asked, &quot;Do we know of the girl&#39;s whereabouts?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Walter replied. &quot;The Morse family is currently housing the young 
girl at their flat in west London.&quot; He then added, &quot;Coincidentally, that 
same tower flat is currently the home of one of our employees, Miss 
Hedgley.&quot;

&quot;She was Fargason&#39;s granddaughter, was she not?&quot; Sir Integra asked, 
remembering her late field commander, killed in the incident involving 
the vampire Incognito. &quot;I remember giving the girl her current 
employment after the Queen had pardoned us, mostly as a favor to him.&quot; 
Walter simply nodded.

The phone rang, bringing the two out of their reminisces. Taking note, 
Sir Integra answered it. &quot;This is Sir Integra,&quot; she answered.

&quot;Sir Integra,&quot; a woman&#39;s voice called out, &quot;I need your help!&quot;

&quot;Miss Hedgley? Is something wrong?&quot; the Hellsing leader asked.

&quot;We have trouble over in my flat!&quot; Moria&#39;s voice replied. &quot;The hallways 
outside are crawling with ghouls!&quot;

&quot;What was that, you say?&quot; Sir Integra said, alarmed.

&quot;Ghouls, a whole group of them!&quot; Moria said. &quot;I&#39;m currently barricaded 
in my apartment, but I believe there&#39;s no guarantee that it would keep 
them at bay!&quot;

&quot;Listen Miss Hedgley, whatever you do, stay there until help we get 
there, do not leave that room until help arrives! Am I understood?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I believe we&#39;ll do just that! Oh please, Sir Integra, get here 
soon!&quot; Moria pleaded.

&quot;Rest assured, I will, Miss Hedgley.&quot; Sir Integra then hung up, but kept 
the receiver in her hand. &quot;It seems like the problem we have been 
discussing has once again reared its head! That was Miss Hedgley, and it 
appears her tower flat has been invaded by ghouls!&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Walter gasped. &quot;That IS a problem. I suppose you will be 
calling back Alucard and Seras?&quot;

&quot;Already on that,&quot; Sir Integra crisply said as she dialed-up the motor 
pool. &quot;But right now, this requires an immediate response!&quot;

The speaker on the phone rang once before: &quot;Berttle here.&quot;

&quot;Have a transport warmed-up and in front of the compound in two minutes! 
Address will follow!&quot; the Hellsing leader commanded as she pressed 
another button near the phone

XXX

Red lights flashed in the Wild Geese&#39;s ready room, followed by an alarm 
klaxon blaring. Several of the mercenaries lounging around immedietly 
dropped whatever they were doing, either eating, playing cards or just 
talking, and raced for the weapons locker, where they were issued 
appropriate arms and ammunition.

Noticing the chaos around her, Rally watched the activity as she exited 
the lower levels and summized the situation. &#39;At least it&#39;ll mean I&#39;ll 
have something to do rather than mopping all night,&#39; the dusky vampire 
thought to herself as she joined the Geese outside.

In less than the two minutes ordered, an armored personnel carrier, with 
Berttle driving, was standing outside and the rear door down. Outside 
it, Pip Bernadotte was barking orders to his men, who were racing 
towards it, &quot;C&#39;mon, we haven&#39;t all night! Move it, Move it!&quot; He then 
noticed Rally also racing inside with the others. &quot;Zo mademoiselle,&quot; he 
said, &quot;joining us as well, non?&quot;

&quot;Of course, you asshole,&quot; Rally snarled, causing Pip to cringe slightly, 
remembering the bad night the vampire was having.

After getting the address, the APC made its way out of the Hellsing 
mansion, the occupants readying themselves for the coming battle. Rally 
sat next to Pip, almost alone in her thoughts - until she felt a tapping 
on her shoulder. &quot;Here, take zese&quot; Pip said, holding a portable radio 
and earpiece in his hand. &quot;I know you have telepathy, but I don&#39;t know 
if you&#39;ll be able to talk to us with it. Zese will let you communicate 
to ze rest of us.&quot; Rally just nodded, clipping the pack to her belt and 
adjusting the earpiece.

While she did this, Pip silently observed the dusky vampire. &#39;I know you 
that are suffering, mon ami,&#39; the mercenary thought sympathetically to 
himself, &#39;and believe me, if I were in ze same situation, I would 
certainly die rather than see harm done to Mignonette by my hands, as 
well as Mademoiselle Moria . All I ask is... be strong. I am certain 
that a solution to your problem will present itself soon.&#39;

The transport soon found itself at the parameter a kilometer outside the 
flat. Surrounded by police barricades, the residents that did evacuate 
when the ghouls attacked just looked as the transport was waived 
through. Rally looked outside the window, already feeling her vampiric 
blood stirring at the prospect of battle.Several of the Geese readied 
themselves as the transport stopped outside the building, then departed 
quickly as the rear door dropped. As soon as the back was emptied and 
the door secured, Berttle exited as well, grabbing his machine gun and 
ammo in the process.

A group of ghouls were waiting as well, moaning and growling upon 
sensing fresh meat leaving the vehicle. The Geese positioned themselves 
in a line about twenty meters in front of the monsters. Pip, with Rally 
next to him, took an assessment of the situation facing them. &quot;Okay 
men,&quot; he called out, &quot;whatever you do... aim carefully! If you don&#39;t, we 
could be facing hard times ahead, not to mention wasting very expensive 
ammunition!&quot; Silently acknowledging, the Geese took aim. &quot;Ready... 
FIRE!!&quot;

The Geese fired as one. However, they seemed to be having a tough time 
trying to stop the ghouls. Despite being armed with silver-alloy bullets 
that had been blessed, the ghouls continued to advance. However, in 
time, many of them did drop, which allowed the Geese to advance towards 
the building&#39;s entrance.

Rally was firing as well, Purgatory blazing as she managed to take down 
ghouls easier than the human troops. It was while this was going on that 
she heard a crackling over her headset. &quot;What?&quot; she shouted, annoyed at 
being distracted in her job.

&quot;Rally,&quot; Sir Integra&#39;s voice sounded, &quot;I need you to find your way 
inside and to the sixth floor.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a little busy right now, Integra!&quot; Rally called out. &quot;Can&#39;t this 
wait?&quot;

&quot;I do realize your situation but this is urgent!&quot; the Hellsing leader 
answered. &quot;Miss Hedgley and a companion is trapped in her flat by a 
group of ghouls and urgently needs to be rescued!&quot;

&#39;Moria!&#39; Rally thought of herself, alarmed. &quot;Okay, I&#39;m on it!&quot; she 
replied. Turning to Pip, she called out, &quot;I need to get to the sixth 
floor, but since Master isn&#39;t here, I&#39;m going to need some back-up! 
Could I spare one of your men, Pip?&quot;

&quot;Oui, you can spare ME!&quot; Pip replied. Turning to Sergio, he called out, 
&quot;You&#39;re in charge, mon ami! Just make sure zese damned ghouls don&#39;t 
advance into ze street!&quot; Sergio nodded in turn. &quot;Okay, zo how are we 
going to get past zese monsters?&quot; he asked Rally.

&quot;Oh I think I&#39;ve got an answer,&quot; she smirked, grabbing Pip by the waist. 
&quot;Just don&#39;t get any ideas while we&#39;re at it, though.&quot; Before the 
mercenary could object, the two found themselves teleporting away from 
the street.

The next thing Pip realized, the two of them had materialized on the 
sixth floor. Releasing her passenger, Rally couldn&#39;t help but notice 
that Pip seemed visibly shaken. &quot;Merde! Why... why didn&#39;t you... warn me 
zat you were... going to do zat!?&quot; the mercenary managed to say between 
gasps.

&quot;Sorry, Pip. Believe me, it was the first time I did that while carrying 
a human,&quot; Rally replied with a smile.

&quot;Eet&#39;s forgiven, zat&#39;s for certain,&quot; Pip added. &quot;Right now, I&#39;m smelling 
something, and I can tell you eet&#39;s not at all pleasant.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Rally snarled, seeing a group of ghouls pawing at a door in the 
gloom. &quot;I say we clean this mess up quickly,&quot; she added, pumping 
Purgatory.

&quot;Oui. Let&#39;s,&quot; Pip grinned, slamming a clip into his machine gun.

XXX

&quot;Oh my god, they&#39;re trying to break through!&quot; Elysse cried, backing away 
from the door.

Moria was already in front of it, brandishing an automatic pistol she 
got from her bedroom. &quot;I know that, just stay behind me!&quot; she called 
out, slamming a clip in, loading the chamber and making sure the 
safety&#39;s off.

As the sound of the ghouls made themselves louder, the young brunette 
couldn&#39;t help but to feel afraid of them. However, she steeled herself 
as she cocked the hammer and took aim at the door, ready to fire. All of 
a sudden, though, the sounds of a machine gun firing, as well as shotgun 
blasts, made themselves evident for a few seconds, then silence.

After a few seconds of this silence, a loud banging came from the door. 
&quot;MORIA!? MORIA, ARE YOU ALRIGHT!? ANSWER ME!!&quot; a frantic female voice 
called out.

Recognizing the voice, Moria raced over to one end of the sofa. &quot;Elysse, 
grab the other end of this thing and help me haul it off!&quot; she yelled.

&quot;Are you certain it&#39;s safe?&quot; the other woman asked as she grasped the 
other end. Moria didn&#39;t answer as the two moved the sofa away from the 
door. And just as quickly, the young brunette raced to the door and 
opened it, recognizing the face on the other side.

&quot;Rally Vincent,&quot; Moria said, feeling relieved. &quot;So help me, this is one 
instance I can safely say that I&#39;m glad to see you!&quot;

&quot;Glad to hear,&quot; the dusky vampire said, who then noticed that Moria was 
not alone. &quot;So, who&#39;s your friend?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Oh her? She&#39;s Elysse Morse, a neighbor of mine,&quot; answered Moria. 
&quot;Rally, is there any way you can get us out of here?&quot;

Rally suddenly felt uncomfortable. Certainly she could teleport Moria 
out of the building, but she didn&#39;t know about the other human. &quot;Well, I 
might,&quot; she pointed to Elysse, &quot;but I&#39;m not certain she can keep her 
mouth shut. Look, all I ask of you is that you and your friend stay in 
here until...&quot;

&quot;YEEEAAAAUUUGGGGHHHH!!&quot; All four individuals turned to hear an anguished 
scream of a woman around the bend.

&quot;Mon dieu!&quot; Pip exclaimed, bracing his machine gun. &quot;There&#39;s someone 
else on this floor!&quot;

&quot;Tell me something I don&#39;t know!&quot; Rally replied sarcastically, racing to 
the sound of the scream. Pip soon followed her.

However, Elysse, forgetting what Rally had said, raced out of the room, 
following the sound. &quot;Elysse... wait!&quot; Moria exclaimed, keeping her gun 
in hand as she followed.

They didn&#39;t take long until Rally and Pip found the source of the 
scream. A figure was hunched over the corpse of the female victim, 
sounds of slurping being heard. &quot;OKAY, HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!!&quot; commanded 
Rally, drawing a bead on the figure.

Said figure turned around. It looked like a teenaged girl, fangs 
flashing as she looked as if she didn&#39;t like having her dinner 
interrupted. &quot;Okay, now drop the victim and don&#39;t move, so that I can 
get a good shot at you!&quot; Rally added. However, the girl didn&#39;t seem 
inclined to obey, her blood-red eyes - the same color as Rally&#39;s - 
flashing as she prepared to defend her meal.

&quot;OH MY GOD... JENN!!&quot; Elysse screamed, having encountered the others.

&quot;What in God&#39;s name?&quot; Moria gasped, seeing the whole situation.

However, the vampire in question - Jenn Wooley - snapped out of her rage 
and recognized the two behind Rally and Pip. &quot;Mrs. Morse... Miss 
Hedgley?&quot; she gasped, getting up and starting to advance.

&quot;DON&#39;T MOVE!!&quot; Rally yelled, pumping Purgatory. &quot;You know, it&#39;s bad 
enough that FREAKs like you give the rest of us vampires a bad name, but 
having to turn an entire building into your buffet table... that&#39;s just 
low!&quot;

&quot;What... what in the world is she talking about?&quot; Elysse whimpered.

Pip turned to the two women. &quot;Zat girl&#39;s a vampire, possibly a chipped 
one,&quot; the Frenchman said. &quot;Look, eet&#39;s dangerous for you two to be 
around, zo...&quot;

&quot;Captain Bernadotte, that is ridiculous,&quot; Moria said, whispering to Pip. 
&quot;I&#39;ve known Jenn Wooley for two weeks and I can tell you she&#39;s no 
vampire.&quot;

&quot;How can you be certain, Mon Chere?&quot; Pip asked. Moria then whispered 
information into the Frenchman&#39;s ear.

In the meantime, Jenn looked around, confused. &quot;What are you all talking 
about?&quot; she whimpered. Then she got a look at the body near her. &quot;OH 
NO!! WHAT... WHAT...?&quot;

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Rally smirked, edging closer. &quot;You drank the blood 
of some of the residents here and turned them into ghouls.&quot;

&quot;But... but... I was only babysitting Angela for the Morses,&quot; pleaded 
Jenn. &quot;I fell asleep... and the next thing I knew, I&#39;m over here!&quot; She 
collapsed to her knees, crying. &quot;Oh Gram... where are you? I need your 
help!&quot;

&quot;Rally,&quot; Pip whispered, walking closer to the vampire, &quot;I think ze 
situation eez a bit more complicated than you think.&quot; Pointing to Moria, 
he added, &quot;Miss Hedgley informs me zat ze girl was out and about this 
morning when she left for work, eating toast before going to ze store.&quot;

&quot;What? But how...?&quot; Rally sputtered, but then everyone&#39;s attention was 
turned to another ghoul shambling towards them; a female, and from the 
looks of it, originally middle-aged.

Elysse immedietly recognized the ghoul. &quot;Emma!&quot; she gasped, shocked.

Jenn also identified the ghoul. &quot;Gram?&quot; she added. All of a sudden, 
images flashed in her mind; a vaguely-cognizant memory of attacking Emma 
Wooley. &quot;Oh God... what have I done?&quot;

Still confused by the various reactions, Rally decided to turn her 
attention to the ghoul approaching. &quot;I&#39;ll deal with you later, right now 
I better take care of this ghoul!&quot; she snarled, then drew her aim. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry I have to do this,&quot; Rally whispered. &quot;But don&#39;t worry... I&#39;ll end 
your agony soon.&quot; She then began to squeeze the trigger, only to find a 
hand grabbing the barrel at the last moment.

BLAM!

The next thing Rally knew, she saw Jenn&#39;s shocked face, the slug 
penetrating her heart as she pulled the barrel of Purgatory into it. 
&quot;What the...?&quot; she gasped.

Jenn coughed up a bit of blood. &quot;I had... to make it right,&quot; she gasped. 
Glancing towards, the ghoul, she managed to say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Gram. I... 
didn&#39;t...&quot;, only to collapse to the floor, her body billowing into ash. 
At the same time, the ghoul approaching also crumbled into ash, joining 
her granddaughter and the other ghouls as powdery remains.

&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; Rally said, scratching her head. &quot;She pulled my barrel 
into her and killed herself. Wait a minute... the ghoul fell apart after 
she died. That means she was a TRUE vampire, not a FREAK!&quot;

Upon hearing this, Pip went for his radio. &quot;Sergio,&quot; he called out, &quot;are 
you still fighting ghouls?&quot;

&quot;Si, Capitan,&quot; the Spaniard answered. &quot;A few of them crumbled, but we&#39;re 
still facing a whole group of them! We were able to advance into the 
building when they did, but these monsters just continue to fight!&quot;

While this discussion was going on, Elysse&#39;s head was shaking in 
disbelief with events. &quot;Vampires... here? Then that means... oh my 
god!!&quot; She then broke into a run past Rally and Pip.

The dusky vampire tried to reach out for the woman, but Elysse had 
eluded her grasp. &quot;LADY, WAIT!! IT&#39;S DANGEROUS!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;LL TRY TO STOP HER! MADAME, WAIT!!&quot; Pip called out, making pursuit.

Summoning her courage, Moria managed to walk up to Rally. &quot;I overheard 
what Pip&#39;s men said,&quot; she began. &quot;There&#39;s another vampire in there, do 
you believe?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so, Moria,&quot; added Rally. &quot;Look, the Geese are still fighting 
ghouls downstairs, so I think it&#39;s safer if you stick with me.&quot; She then 
looked at the gun Moria was holding, &quot;Can you shoot that?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Grandfather Peter taught me how,&quot; she agreed.

&quot;Good. Stick close to me. I&#39;m certain Sir Integra&#39;s already called 
Master and Alucard, so they shouldn&#39;t be long,&quot; Rally said as the two 
women followed Pip, but then thought to herself, &#39;But I hate to think 
what will happen when that sensation I had earlier hits.&#39;

XXX

&quot;Little one? Where are you?&quot; Elysse called out as she made her way to 
her flat, and nearly panicked upon seeing the shattered door. &quot;I&#39;m sorry 
I took so long! Oh God, where are you?&quot; Her calls were rewarded by 
hearing crying in a nearby closet. Acting quickly, she opened it, seeing 
the six year-old girl huddled in the closet. &quot;Oh there you are, are you 
alright?&quot;

&quot;The monsters came back and took Jenn,&quot; the girl whimpered. &quot;I thought I 
was next, but I went in here!&quot;

&quot;Well don&#39;t worry... the monsters are gone,&quot; Elysse said, hugging the 
girl. &quot;You&#39;re safe now.&quot;

Just a few seconds behind, Pip managed to find the woman, who was 
hugging the girl. He was about to speak when he caught a horrifying 
sight - the girl&#39;s expression had changed from fear to satisfaction as 
she prepared to sink her fangs into Elysse&#39;s neck! &quot;MADAM - LOOK OUT!!&quot; 
he yelled, pulling Elysse out of the girl&#39;s grasp.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Elysse said indignantly. &quot;I had just saved that 
girl and you...&quot;

&quot;That was not nice, you foolish human,&quot; a new voice said. Pip and 
Elysse&#39;s attention was turned to the girl - who&#39;s eyes now shown with 
the same orange-red gleam that Alucard and Seras had. &quot;I was about to 
another meal when you interrupted me,&quot; she said in an all-too adult 
tone, fangs displayed in a predatory smile.

&quot;Wha... wha...wha...?&quot; Elysse sputtered, shocked.

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry, now that I know that this human is here, he won&#39;t 
interrupt me... ever again!&quot; the girl snarled as she lunged towards Pip.

However, as soon as she did, the Frenchman opened fire upon the vampire 
- only to find the girl dodging the shots. Pip was about to become the 
pint-sized bloodsucker&#39;s next meal when a shotgun blast forced her to 
retreat.

&quot;So, it looks like we&#39;ve found the source of all the trouble... a 
pre-school vampire!&quot; Rally said as she pumped the spent shell out of 
Purgatory, Moria also taking aim.

And soon they found they were not alone. Alucard and Seras soon appeared 
next to them, with the Draculina standing next to her fledgling. &quot;Sorry 
about earlier, Rally,&quot; Seras began, &quot;but I&#39;ll explain later. Right now, 
let&#39;s deal with this.&quot;

&quot;Uh... yeah, Master,&quot; Rally replied, noticing that she didn&#39;t have the 
urge to attack Seras. &#39;Maybe that whole bit tonight WAS a passing 
phase,&#39; she thought to herself.

The No-Life King, however, turned his attention to the childlike 
vampire. &quot;I should have thought you were the cause of all this trouble, 
Angela!&quot; he growled. &quot;Even after three hundred years, you still have no 
sense of restraint!&quot;

Angela just smirked. &quot;Oh really?&quot; she chirped in mock surprise. &quot;And 
just what kind of judge of vampire conduct are you... Prince Vlad?&quot;

Surprised, Rally turned to Alucard. &quot;She... she knows who you really 
are!&quot; she gasped.

&quot;A long story, Rally Vincent, to be sure&quot; Alucard answered, still eyeing 
Angela poisonously.

&quot;Indeed it is,&quot; Angela said, still smirking, &quot;and I guarantee you this - 
the explanation that will follow will not be enough to save you all!&quot;
