<h1>Through the Years: Awakening (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gunsmith/index.html">Gunsmith Cats</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AUTHOR&#39;S NOTE - Whatever happens between light and darkness that 
influences events around us? And what happens when we willingly depart 
life to an existence beyond life itself? Do we vainly hold on to the 
light and hope not to be totally consumed by the darkness? Or do we lose 
ourselves, embrace the darkness and try to destroy the light?

But most of all, the greatest question is...

WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED BETWEEN PARTS EIGHT AND NINE OF &#39;THROUGH THE 
YEARS&#39;!?

For that last question, I offer this extra chapter, hoping to cover the 
time between Rally Vincent&#39;s death in the warehouse and her rise as a 
vampire later on. Believe me, this is going to be a stretch for me, so 
if I happen to drift out-of-context, please excuse me.

With that done... on with the fiction.

XXX

Firemen directed a search inside an abandoned warehouse following an 
explosion and collapse inside. Standing near the battalion chief, 
Detective Roy Coleman made a cursory explanation, hoping the story he 
was concocting is half-way believable. He was still trying to deal with 
what had happened earlier, and was thankful that Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah 
was able to drive Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent&#39;s Cobra away before the fire 
crews arrived.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad this guy was the only one there and reasonably unhurt,&quot; 
the chief said, pointing to a handcuffed Alfie, who was sitting in the 
backseat of Coleman&#39;s car. &quot;We&#39;ll take it from here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. I&#39;ll take this guy into headquarters and get out of your 
way.&quot; Coleman then got inside and buckled himself in. &quot;Alright Alfie, 
I&#39;ll make this brief,&quot; he growled, &quot;the fact that Rally was in that 
warehouse is NOT to get out to the public! You make any mention of 
this... and I&#39;ll personally feed you to Alucard! Have I made myself 
clear?&quot; he plainly said.

&quot;As crystal, Detective,&quot; Alfie replied, relaxing in the back seat. &quot;To 
be honest, I&#39;ll feel safer in the joint where Goldie won&#39;t be after me.&quot; 
He thought for a minute before adding, &quot;But I was wondering... did Rally 
make it out before the remainder of that roof came down? I didn&#39;t see 
her with you, and those strange guys that were with you already took 
off.&quot;

Coleman hesitated for a moment before answering. &quot;Uh... yeah she did. As 
for those others... the same as Rally. Understand?&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; said Alfie.

Coleman then started the car and began for the precinct, his mind still 
going over the events of earlier: they had found Rally buried under at 
least a half a ton of concrete and rebar, injured so greatly that a 
normal death was minutes away... until Seras Victoria, under the bequest 
of Rally, gave his friend ANOTHER death - the undead existence of a 
vampire.

Just before the firetrucks arrived, Seras and Rally, along with Sir 
Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, Alucard, Walter C. Dolnez and Becky 
&#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah, had left the scene. &#39;That girl vampire said Rally was 
dead, but she got to her in time,&#39; Coleman thought to himself. &#39;Strange 
thing... I didn&#39;t see Rally breathing, nor showed any signs of life. If 
she&#39;s right, I wonder what kind of &#39;life&#39; is Rally in for?&#39;

RALLY AND MAY&#39;S HOUSE, SOME MINUTES LATER...

Using the Cobra&#39;s remote, Becky was able to open the garage door and 
drive inside. As soon as the engine was shut-off and the door shut, she 
exited, followed by Seras Victoria, who sat in the back seat. &quot;So far,&quot; 
the information expert said, retrieving her laptop, &quot;nobody&#39;s followed 
us, except for Sir Integra. At least that&#39;s something.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Seras added. &quot;Have you got any keys to the house?&quot;

&quot;Why of course... Rally gave me an extra set in case I needed to get 
in... which reminds me,&quot; Becky said, &quot;Seras, could you get her?&quot;

&quot;That was the first thing on my mind, Becky,&quot; the Draculina answered, 
going to the passenger side. Seated in the front passenger seat, tightly 
wrapped in a blanket, was the dead body of Rally, her head poking out of 
it. After opening the door, Seras carefully gathered-up the lifeless 
body of the bounty hunter, cradled her gently, then closed the door. 
Nodding to the information expert, she followed her inside the house.

Just as Becky walked inside the living room, she heard the tapping on 
the door. Making her way to the front door, she unlocked and opened it. 
Standing at the entrance, Sir Integra, still dressed in her torn and 
soiled suit walked inside, followed by Walter. &quot;I trust your trip was 
uneventful,&quot; the Hellsing leader tursly said.

&quot;If you mean nobody - especially that crazy priest Anderson - followed 
us, then the answer is yes,&quot; Becky added, then noting the condition of 
Sir Integra&#39;s suit added, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you had to get dirty back there.&quot;

Sir Integra finally took note of her suit. &quot;It is nothing, Miss Farrah. 
I have other suits back at the embassy. It is Rally that I am most 
concerned with,&quot; she said. Looking around, she added, &quot;Where is Seras?&quot;

&quot;She should be behind me,&quot; Becky answered. &quot;She&#39;s getting Rally. I think 
she should be about...&quot; Then Seras showed up, Rally in her arms. &quot;Oh... 
there they are.&quot;

The Draculina noticed the two. &quot;Sir Integra, I&#39;m taking Rally upstairs 
to get her cleaned up. Is there anything I can do for you?&quot; she asked.

Sir Integra shook her head. &quot;No, not right now. You go ahead and get her 
cleaned. I will stay down here.&quot; Seras nodded.

As Seras carried the lifeless Rally upstairs, Becky turned to face Sir 
Integra and said, &quot;If there&#39;s nothing I can do right now, I think I&#39;ll 
help out Seras.&quot;

&quot;Go ahead. It will be a while before the sun sets again.&quot; Sir Integra 
then sat herself down on the sofa and situated herself.

&quot;If you would,&quot; Walter added, &quot;do you think you could obtain Miss 
Vincent&#39;s sidearm? I will see if I can clean it for her, as well as... 
well... modifying it to her new condition.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do just that, thank you,&quot; Becky said, ascending the stairs.

The two then proceed to Rally&#39;s bedroom, where Seras gently set her down 
on the bed. Wisely, Becky goes to the bathroom, where she returns with 
towels, soap, and a basin of warm water. &quot;I think I can handle it from 
here, Becky,&quot; the Draculina told the information expert as she 
re-entered the bedroom. &quot;Why don&#39;t you go downstairs and see to Sir 
Integra. She must be exhausted from the night&#39;s events.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Becky answered, taking Rally&#39;s CZ-75 as per Walter&#39;s 
instructions. &quot;Let me know if you need help.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll remember that,&quot; Seras said. After Becky left the room, she then 
proceeded to undress Rally, discarding her blooded and soiled clothing, 
taking from them a slip of paper from her coat. &#39;I bet this is 
important,&#39; she thought of herself, placing the paper in a pocket. 
Pausing briefly, she looked at the nude form lying on the bed and 
smiled. &quot;And you thought I had a beautiful body, Rally,&quot; she remarked as 
she gently caressed Rally&#39;s naked right breast, as well as slightly 
pinching the nipple, then proceeded to towel-bathe her.

This took a while, but soon Rally was cleaned. Carefully maneuvering the 
bounty hunter into the bed, Seras pulled the covers over her naked body 
until only her bare shoulders and head protruded from them. She then 
gathered the towels and basin and returned them to the bathroom. It was 
while leaving the bathroom she ran into Alucard, who was leaning against 
the wall near Rally&#39;s bedroom. &quot;Care for a little company, Seras?&quot; he 
asked.

&quot;I guess it wouldn&#39;t hurt, Master,&quot; the Draculina replied. The two then 
entered the bedroom, where Seras took-up a position besides Rally&#39;s bed 
and the nightstand, then slumped down to the floor. &quot;I hope I did the 
right thing, making her a vampire and all,&quot; she finally said. &quot;Rally 
deserved to be a human, and I&#39;m not so certain she realizes what life 
she&#39;s in for.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about it much. It was her decision to make, Seras,&quot; 
the No-Life King said, pulling-up a chair next to his former fledgling. 
&quot;There is still the matter of her kidnapped friend May to deal with. As 
for the future,&quot; he then smiled, &quot;well... I&#39;m certain you will be up to 
the task of showing her what&#39;s in store.&quot; Alucard took another look at 
Seras and added, &quot;And besides... I think she would benefit from having a 
master who will not make her regret her choice. You DO remember MY 
tutelage of you, do you?&quot;

Seras looked up and smiled wryly, &quot;You were an arrogant bastard who 
threatened, intimidated, tormented and bullied me every opportunity you 
had... but I learned a lot from it, and I&#39;m grateful about it.&quot; She 
glanced over to Rally and added, &quot;I hope I can be as good of a teacher 
to her as you were to me.&quot;

&quot;She already has the basics to start,&quot; Alucard said. &quot;We - you and I - 
will need to expand upon that.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean &#39;we&#39;, Master?&quot; Seras asked, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;Well, I have no qualms about your ability to instruct her in the finer 
points of being a vampire... but you don&#39;t think Sir Integra will solely 
rely on your teachings?&quot; Alucard smirked. &quot;She&#39;s more than likely to 
have me help you out.&quot;

Seras thought for a second, then smiled. &quot;Oh. I... guess it wouldn&#39;t 
hurt if you do, Master.&quot;

DOWNSTAIRS, AT THE SAME TIME...

Becky handed Walter Rally&#39;s CZ-75 as the butler prepared to leave for 
the English embassy extension compound. &quot;Please make sure this gets back 
to Rally,&quot; she said, &quot;I have a feeling she going need it to get May 
back.&quot;

&quot;It should not take me long, Miss Farrah,&quot; the old butler and former 
vampire slayer said. &quot;All I have to do is clean it and replace the 
trigger spring to one with a stronger pull. In the meantime, I will 
bring over a replacement suit, as well as toiletries for Sir Integra.&quot; 
He then looked over to Sir Integra, who was rubbing her temples and 
added, &quot;I will try to return at least an hour before sundown, Sir 
Integra. I trust you will be well until then?&quot;

&quot;I will, Walter,&quot; the Hellsing leader sighed.

After Walter departed, Becky picked-up her laptop, called-up an alarm 
clock program and set it to one and a half hour before sundown. &quot;There,&quot; 
she said to herself. &quot;At least we should get some rest before Rally 
wakes up.&quot; She then turned her attention to Sir Integra, mostly because 
there were still concerns she needed to address. &quot;Excuse me?&quot; she began. 
&quot;There are some things I need to talk about.&quot;

&quot;About Rally?&quot; Sir Integra said.

Becky nodded. &quot;I was wondering... how much of the old Rally will 
remain... and how much of her would change.&quot;

Sir Integra briefly looked up. &quot;In many ways, she will be the same Rally 
you have known all this time,&quot; she began. &quot;However, she will no longer 
be human. Until she is stronger, she will have to avoid the sun, silver 
and garlic or be destroyed. But of course... she will, at times, be 
consumed by an all-powerful hunger for blood, and a need to hunt for it. 
She will need to learn to control that... or else she will become more 
of a monster than a rational being. Alucard was just the same when he 
was bound to my family.&quot; A sad look then came over her eyes as she said, 
&quot;But the worst thing, she will be immortal... unaging and forever 
beautiful. She will face the prospect of seeing those she loves and 
cherishes grow old and die... her father, May, Lt. Coleman, myself... 
and you, Miss Farrah.&quot;

Becky felt dejected, knowing that Rally existence might be an unhappy 
one. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s... pretty heavy stuff,&quot; she said. Then she glanced 
over to the window. &quot;Hmm... the sun is rising,&quot; she observed, walking 
over to it. She spent a few minutes watching the sunrise. &quot;Rally always 
loved a good sunrise. Too bad it&#39;ll be a long time before she can see 
another one.&quot; Becky than stretched-out and yawned. &quot;Man, am I tired! 
I&#39;ll see if I can get some blankets and bed-in until evening. What do 
you think, Sir Integra?&quot; She got no answer. &quot;Sir Integra?&quot; Turning 
around, Becky saw that Sir Integra had fallen asleep on the couch. 
Walking over quietly, she gently took-off her glasses and set them down 
on the table, then quietly ascended the stairs.

When she got to the second floor landing, she was surprised to see 
Alucard, standing with blankets in hand. &quot;I believe you were needing 
these,&quot; he drolled, smiling a fanged smile.

&quot;Er... yeah, thanks,&quot; Becky nervously said, gingerly taking the blankets 
from the nosferatu&#39;s arms. Finding her courage, she then asked, &quot;What 
about Seras and Rally? I was wondering...&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you see for yourself, Miss Farrah?&quot; Alucard said, gently 
opening the door.

Peering through, she saw Seras asleep next to Rally, who was lying still 
on the bed. Becky couldn&#39;t help but to feel fascinated that her friend 
looked apparently unharmed, and at the same time was unnerved that she 
wasn&#39;t breathing. &quot;Is... is this normal, her not breathing?&quot; she asked 
Alucard.

&quot;It is,&quot; the No-Life King said. &quot;True vampires only need to breathe so 
that we can talk. I wouldn&#39;t worry about Rally Vincent, though... she 
may have entered a whole new world, but she will not face it alone. She 
will have the best of teachers to train her how to use her abilities, as 
well as learning how to live among humans.&quot;

&quot;Humans like me and May,&quot; Becky added ruefully. &quot;I hope Rally has the 
courage to face all that.&quot; She then looked at the blankets and said, &quot;I 
better get downstairs. You need anything?&quot;

&quot;No, Miss Farrah,&quot; Alucard replied. &quot;I&#39;ll just repair myself into the 
basement until just before sunrise.&quot; Then in an afterthought, he added, 
&quot;Oh, you might want to take several blood packets from the freezer. I&#39;m 
certain Walter will bring more.&quot;

&quot;Okay. How many?&quot;

&quot;Four, if there is that many,&quot; Alucard said. &quot;One for me and Seras... 
and two for Rally.&quot; He grinned as he said, &quot;I have a feeling that she 
might be especially hungry upon waking up.&quot;

Becky gulped hearing this. &quot;S-sure, why not?&quot; she managed to say, 
hurrying down the stairs. Setting down the blankets, she went over to 
the freezer and got out the packets of blood, placing them into the 
refrigerator. Returning to the living room, she taken one of the 
blankets and covered Sir Integra. Then finding a recliner, Becky covered 
herself with the other. &#39;Oh Rally,&#39; she thought to herself as she took 
off her glasses and settled herself for her nap, &#39;for May&#39;s sake... for 
EVERYBODY&#39;S sake... I hope you wake up with as much of the same Rally 
that we all know.&#39;

XXX

AN HOUR BEFORE SUNSET...

Other than the news of the warehouse ceiling collapse, the day around 
Chicago was rather uneventful. People went about their business like 
just any other day. As for the neighbors around Rally&#39;s house, few of 
them took note of a Rolls-Royce pulling in front of the house, followed 
by a late-model sedan. Roy Coleman exited the sedan and saw Walter leave 
the Rolls, carrying with him a fresh suit for Sir Integra and two cases, 
although rather unsteadily. &quot;Here,&quot; Coleman said, &quot;let me take those off 
your hands.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you, Lt. Coleman,&quot; the old butler said. &quot;I must admit, I am 
not exactly as young as I used to be. There was a time long ago I could 
handle such a load with ease.&quot;

&quot;Oh I wouldn&#39;t say that,&quot; Coleman said, smiling. &quot;From what Rally told 
me, you were able to handle that priest Anderson very well.&quot; Then his 
smile faded. As them walked up to the door, he sighed and added, &quot;About 
Rally... do you know what to expect when she wakes up?&quot;

&quot;It is hard to tell, Lt. Coleman,&quot; Walter replied, noting Coleman&#39;s 
concern. &quot;How one reacts to becoming a vampire varies with the 
individual. If we were to cite Miss Victoria&#39;s example, she might come 
out of this quite well, albeit quite clumsily. However,&quot; he added 
darkly, &quot;if Miss Vincent cannot handle the transition well, she may go 
insane... which could mean she would have to be destroyed quickly... 
before she kills innocents in her madness.&quot;

&quot;Well... let&#39;s all pray for the first part,&quot; Coleman remarked.

Using a key he had, Coleman opened the door. He noticed that Sir Integra 
and Becky were asleep in the living room, so he motioned Walter to enter 
quietly, which the butler did. Then the alarm Becky had set went off, 
prompting the information expert to wake up. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you, Roy,&quot; she 
said sleepily as she shut it off.

&quot;Sorry about being late, but I was going over reports on the roof 
collapse and then had to get some shuteye before coming here,&quot; Coleman 
said. Noticing that Sir Integra was also awakening, he added, &quot;Anything 
happen coming here?&quot;

The Hellsing leader yawned briefly before saying, &quot;No, we came here 
without incident.&quot; Seeing Walter, she added, &quot;So is Rally&#39;s gun ready, 
Walter?&quot;

&quot;Indeed it is,&quot; Walter said, producing the CZ-75. &quot;There wasn&#39;t much to 
do, the craftsmanship of the gun was already superb. However, I did 
craft a new spring for the trigger, taking into account the possibility 
of Miss Vincent&#39;s increased strength. I am also thinking of fabricating 
a titanium nitrate-plated barrel, noticing that she is in the habit of 
using overpressured 9mm rounds, from what I studied from the clip she 
had, and figured she might benefit from the increased strength. Perhaps 
later, I will fashion armament that might be suitable to her in the 
future, should she choose to accept.&quot; He handed the suit to Sir Integra, 
as well as an overnight bag. &quot;Here you are. I also chose to pack 
appropriate toiletries for a shower, if not a bath.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Walter.&quot; Sir Integra then turned to Becky, &quot;I was wondering 
if there was, by any chance, someplace I could at least shower here?&quot;

Becky thought for a minute. &quot;There is the downstairs guest room,&quot; she 
said. &quot;I know it has a separate bathroom, nothing fancy though.&quot;

&quot;Good. At least there will be someplace for me to shower and change,&quot; 
the Hellsing leader said. Taking the suit and toiletries, Sir Integra is 
escorted by Becky to the guest room, but not before saying, &quot;I should 
not be long. Walter, see to it that preparations are made for Rally&#39;s 
awakening.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sir Integra,&quot; the old butler answered.

&quot;Oh I made sure there were several blood packs placed in the 
refrigerator,&quot; Becky added, turning around.

&quot;Why thank you, Miss Farrah. I will attend to them immedietly,&quot; Walter 
replied as he made his way to the kitchen, with Coleman following close 
behind. As he placed the blood packs into a bowl and emptied several ice 
trays into it, he noticed Alucard materializing near him. &quot;So, another 
of your children will walk the earth soon... or more accurately a 
grandchild. Not exactly what the Hellsing Organization stands for, is it 
not? I must admit, I have destroyed quite a few in my day. I sincerely 
hope that Miss Vincent will not be one of them.&quot;

&quot;Oh I have faith that will not occur, old friend,&quot; the No-Life King 
drolled, grinning.

&quot;Well, whatever the outcome,&quot; Walter continued, &quot;we are going to have to 
consider Miss Vincent&#39;s future. I do not suppose you have any ideas?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe in planning for the future, you should know that, 
Walter,&quot; Alucard said plainly, studying the sealing runes on his gloves. 
&quot;Immortality is an illusion, sought by only the foolish and fearful. I 
had lived a long time, surviving the demise of my kingdom in Walachia to 
the Ottoman Turks, draining the lives of those I encountered for the 
past five hundred years... until I crossed paths with that damnable 
Abraham Van Helsing, which bound me to Sir Integra&#39;s line. Yes, I&#39;ve 
lived long... but even I know that I am finite. And I eagerly await my 
eventual end. My only wish is that Rally Vincent realizes this fact... 
that, even though she will still be young and beautiful, she will, as 
well as I, face her demise.&quot;

&quot;I think you are being too fatalistic, old friend,&quot; Walter said, picking 
up the tray. &quot;Well, no use forestalling this task. Might as well deliver 
Miss Vincent&#39;s first meal.&quot;

Alucard opened the door as he guided Walter towards the stairs, where 
they are greeted by Seras. &quot;You asked for me, Master?&quot; she began.

&quot;Yes, Seras, I need to talk to you about something.&quot; He allowed Walter 
to enter the room with the blood. &quot;You must realize that, upon rising, 
Rally will be facing the most dangerous part of her new life.&quot;

&quot;I do, Master.&quot;

&quot;Then you must know that, usually, this would be the time a new vampire 
is the most hungriest - which is also the time where they may go mad 
upon realizing this.&quot; Alucard made an appraising look at Seras and 
added, &quot;Fortunately, you were able to avoid that part - but there is no 
way of knowing if your fledgling will have the same luck.&quot;

&quot;What are you getting to, Master?&quot; the Draculina asked, not liking what 
he was leading to.

&quot;This may be difficult to relate, Seras,&quot; Alucard began, pulling out the 
Jackal from his coat and handing it to her former fledgling, &quot;but upon 
wakening, should Rally go mad as a result of her turning, it must fall 
upon you to end her existence quickly, least she make the humans within 
this dwelling her prey.&quot;

Seras allowed this to sink in, fingering the gunmetal-black weapon 
gingerly before stuffing it behind her under her belt. But Coleman saw 
this, saying, &quot;Now wait a minute - are you telling me is that... in case 
Rally goes crazy, she has to kill her again?&quot;

&quot;It is either that, human - or the situation will become deadly very 
quickly,&quot; Alucard countered. &quot;Now how would you remedy it?&quot;

Coleman thought for a moment. &quot;Now that you put it that way... I would 
imagine Rally would feel quite guilty if she killed people she cared 
about.&quot; He then looked at the nosferatu and added, &quot;Oh, and I would 
appreciate it if you called me Roy Coleman - or Lt. Coleman if you like. 
Being referred to simply as &#39;human&#39; seems a little impersonal.&quot;

&quot;As you wish, Lieutenant,&quot; Alucard replied. &quot;Seras, in any case, 
regardless of the outcome, I would appreciate that you return my weapon 
afterwards.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; the Draculina replied matter-of-factly. &quot;Well, I better go 
upstairs then. Rally should be getting up soon.&quot;

&quot;Do you mind if I come with you, Miss Victoria?&quot; Coleman asked. &quot;I&#39;m the 
closest thing to a family Rally has here and I like to be there when she 
awakens.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t recommend it, Lieutenant,&quot; Seras said. &quot;When Rally does 
awaken, you might be her first target.&quot;

&quot;I still like to come up,&quot; Coleman insisted. &quot;At least to she her... 
just in case...&quot;

Seras thought for a minute. &quot;Well... I guess it wouldn&#39;t hurt if you can 
see her for a brief time. But if I tell you to leave, you best do so. 
Understand?&quot;

&quot;Perfectly.&quot;

Satisfied, both Seras and Coleman ascended the stairs. In the police 
detective&#39;s mind, he was sincerely hoping that the friend he knew for 
years would awaken as more-or-less the same Rally Vincent as always, and 
not a bloodthirsty killer, and that the Draculina next to him wouldn&#39;t 
be forced to destroy her.

Seras&#39; thoughts were the same.
