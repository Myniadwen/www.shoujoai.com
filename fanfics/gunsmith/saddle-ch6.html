<h1>Back in the Saddle (part 6 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gunsmith/index.html">Gunsmith Cats</a>

<a href="../gunsmith/saddle-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Cowboy woke to the light of a streetlamp streaming through the blinds 
into her eyes. She moved stiffly, trying to get some blood flowing 
through her limbs and wasn&#146;t surprised to be rewarded with pretty 
intense pain for her efforts. Not only that, she was hungry. She 
shifted on the cot and the springs, as they always do, creaked loudly. 
Maneuvering carefully, she was able to get one leg over the edge of 
the cot, but standing would have to wait.

There was a soft knock on the door and Rally&#146;s voice. &quot;You up?&quot;

&quot;Come on in, darlin&#39;. I&#146;m awake.&quot; Cowboy blinked as the overhead light 
clicked on.

Rally stood in the door, frowning slightly. &quot;You&#146;re probably hungry.&quot;

Cowboy nodded. &quot;I&#146;m a fair cook, but there&#146;s not a whole lot of 
kitchen back here, is there?&quot; She looked at the coffee pot and 
mini-fridge questioningly.

&quot;No, not really. And I&#146;m no cook at all. Can you walk to the car? I 
know a place we can eat in peace.&quot;

&quot;Where&#146;s your little friend?&quot; Cowboy looked past Rally into the shop.

&quot;May went out for the evening.&quot;

&quot;She got herself a guy, huh?&quot; Cowboy grinned. &quot;A little thing like 
her, I&#146;m not surprised.&quot;

Rally grimaced. &quot;Yeah, well, when he&#146;s not in jail or on the run, he&#146;s 
great for her.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Cowboy said.

Rally hmphed . &quot;That&#146;s not fair- I think Ken really loves her.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Cowboy stared at the far wall. &quot;Uh, how &#145;bout you, Rall? You got 
someone to warm you up at night?&quot;

Rally smiled. &quot;Sure do.&quot; Cowboy looked surprised. Rally pulled her gun 
from her shoulder holster and gave it a kiss.

Cowboy grinned again. &quot;You know,&quot; she leaned forward confidentially, 
&quot;I think you and me are a lot alike. I can&#146;t sleep without my baby 
under my pillow and I bet you can&#146;t either.&quot;

Rally laughed. &quot;You got that right.&quot; Reholstering the CZ75, Rally came 
over and helped Cowboy up. Together they managed to limp over to the 
door.

A tedious few minutes later and Cowboy was awkwardly propped in the 
Cobra. Rally assured her that the place she was thinking of was close. 
They hit a bump in the road and Cowboy said around gritted teeth, 
&quot;Damn I sure hope so. Usually there&#146;s nothing like a little speed to 
heal me, but this is pretty tough.&quot;

Rally was as good as her word. Al&#146;s pizzeria wasn&#146;t much of a 
pizzeria, more like a bar&#133;more like a basement, really, that happened 
to have a bar in it. Rally sat Cowboy facing the door.

&quot;You&#146;re more likely to recognize anyone coming after you.&quot; Rally said 
and went up to the bar to order some of Chicago&#146;s greasiest pizza and 
worst beer. &quot;But,&quot; Rally explained. &quot;what this place lacks for in 
atmosphere and food, it makes up for in security. No one they don&#146;t 
know ever makes it in.&quot;

Cowboy nodded sagely. &quot;Nice plan. How did you get in?&quot;

Rally grinned around a slice of pizza. &quot;The first time? Through the 
front window.&quot;

&quot;Nice subtle way of making an introduction.&quot;

&quot;You should have seen the other guy.&quot; They laughed.

Cowboy rubbed her stomach and sighed. &quot;Man&#133;another of those nasty 
beers and I think I&#146;ll be ready for a ride.&quot; She glanced at Rally. 
&quot;You up to some sightseeing? I don&#146;t get out much these days, on 
account of living in near-condemned warehouses and all.&quot;

Rally shrugged. &quot;Can&#146;t go really fast, though.&quot; She sounded wistful.

&quot;Sorry. I&#146;m a total drag,&quot; Cowboy insisted on paying for dinner. For a 
drifter, Rally noted, she had plenty of cash to hand. Once again, she 
wondered exactly who this woman was.

***

&quot;Say what you will about Chicago, it is pretty at night.&quot; Cowboy was 
propped on the Cobra&#146;s hood, and Rally leaned against the bumper. The 
city sparkled in the night air, a crystal city glittering on the edge 
of the lake.

&quot;Yeah - I guess so.&quot; Rally said a little distantly. &quot;I never noticed 
it.&quot;

&quot;Of course not.&quot; Cowboy nudged her good foot into Rally&#146;s back. 
&quot;You&#146;ve only got eyes for the road.&quot; It took a few moments before she 
realized she was laughing alone. &quot;Yo. What&#146;s gotten into you? I 
thought we didn&#146;t know each other well enough to be depressing.&quot;

Rally looked back over her shoulder. &quot;I&#146;m not sure. I have a bad 
feeling. Maybe I&#146;m paranoid, but I feel like we&#146;re being watched. Can 
we get out of here?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Cowboy slid off the hood and pulled herself into the front 
seat. Rally had already started the ignition and as soon as Cowboy had 
her door closed, the Cobra sped off down the road. Rally kept one eye 
on the rear view mirror and, after a few miles, she smiled grimly.

&quot;Got him. He&#146;s seems to be in a Beemer. I hope he&#146;s had that engine 
tuned up.&quot; Rally shifted gears and laid her foot down. Cowboy rolled 
down the window and adjusted the side mirror, so she could watch the 
BMW fade into the distance.

&quot;He seems to be giving up awfully easy.&quot; Cowboy commented.

&quot;He thinks he&#146;s going to cut me off - there&#146;s some construction down 
this way.&quot; Rally shifted again and made a sharp turn onto a loading 
ramp. &quot;With luck, he&#146;ll come out a the next intersection.&quot;

Cowboy watched as the speedometer climbed. She gripped the dashboard 
tightly as she realized that the loading ramp was about to run out - 
and Rally hadn&#146;t slowed down. The lights of the BMW were just visible 
as they pulled into a cul de sac below&#133; and Rally hit the gas once 
more, forcing the car over the road below and onto the slightly lower 
ramp across the road. Pulling to the right, Rally got the Cobra off 
the ramp and smiled as Cowboy whooped.

&quot;Damnation, Rall!&quot; Cowboy was wishing she had a hat to wave as the 
Cobra spun and bucked around the construction site.

&quot;Hey, I owed you for the bike ride.&quot; Rally pulled her gun and drove 
with one hand.

&quot;Makes me almost wish I had one of these to drive myself.&quot; Cowboy 
grinned.

Rally spun around to the left and killed the lights and engine. &quot;Let&#146;s 
give &#145;em a minute. We may have lost them, but I&#146;m guessing they&#146;ll be 
a little more persistent than that.&quot;

Cowboy nodded. &quot;Probably. I stole something from them. Keaton doesn&#146;t 
seem like the kind of guy who forgives that easily.&quot;

Sure enough, several pairs of headlights became visible, reflecting 
off the building walls. Rally floored the Cobra, its wheels spun and 
they screamed out of the alleyway. Three cars turned and followed, one 
turned around and headed the way it had come in.

The next few minutes went by blindingly fast. Rally seemed to have a 
minutely detailed knowledge of the streets - but so did their 
pursuers. When they got close enough, a few shots were fired, but 
nothing more than cosmetic damage was done, until Rally turned into 
yet another of those interminable alleys. Blocking the end of the 
alley was the original BMW that had chased them. In front of the 
Beemer stood two goons. Rally cursed. Each held something that looked 
way too much like a rocket launcher for Cowboy&#146;s comfort.

&quot;Rall?&quot; Cowboy asked as she pulled her gun. &quot;Can this car climb walls? 
&#145;Cause unless the answer&#146;s yes, I think we&#146;re pretty much done for.&quot;

Rally cursed again. There wasn&#146;t room to turn the car around. She 
ducked, as a bullet shattered the front windshield. &quot;Good, that&#146;s one 
less bullet I have to waste.&quot; She turned to Cowboy, who, grey-faced 
and tight-lipped, hunched her own form down as far as she could. &quot;I&#146;m 
going to let this baby ride&#133;we&#146;re going to have to jump clear. You see 
that door behind the dumpster? You get there and we have a way out.&quot;

Cowboy nodded. 

Rally shifted the car into first, then second and counted quickly. &quot;On 
three. One, two&#133;&quot; she floored the accelerator, and slipped the engine 
into neutral a second later, &quot;three!&quot;

As the car raced towards the men ahead of them, Rally and Cowboy 
rolled out of the doors on either side of the alley. The goons with 
rocket launchers chose that moment to shoot, for which Rally forever 
thanked them. The Cobra was hit and exploded backwards in a cloud of 
shrapnel and smoke, which nicely covered their movements. The momentum 
of the rockets sent the car screaming backwards into the cars that had 
blocked them in from behind. Rally gnashed her teeth and sent up a 
fervent curse to the gods of retribution for the damage to her car, 
then slid behind the dumpster to join a panting Cowboy. 

&quot;You hanging in there?&quot; Rally said, as she shot the lock off the door, 
and edged it open with her shoulder. She cast a last look at the 
wreckage that had been her Cobra and stifled another fit of cursing. 
There&#146;d be time for that later.

&quot;Yeah, but just.&quot; Cowboy&#146;s voice was strained. She followed Rally down 
a few dark stairs, and helped the other woman to wedge the door shut 
again.

Safe for the moment, the two women stood, leaning on whatever they 
could find to hold them up. Cowboy&#146;s leg was bloodstained, and her 
face pale.

&quot;We have to get you somewhere safe.&quot; Rally said, and placed one of 
Cowboy&#146;s arms across her shoulders, helping the woman to limp across 
the floor.

&quot;How are we gonna get out of here?&quot; Cowboy asked. &quot;We&#146;re pretty well 
trapped. They&#146;ll figure out where we are soon enough.&quot;

Rally nodded. &quot;But we won&#146;t be here by then. These old warehouses are 
great - they&#146;re full of tunnels, loading passages and underground 
areas. Most of them have sewer entrances right in the basement. We&#146;ll 
be out of here before they make it past the door.&quot;

Cowboy shook her head. &quot;I&#146;m not going very far, Rall. Maybe you oughta 
leave me here.&quot;

Rally shot her a look, but said nothing. They reached the far side of 
the room where an old, ratty door that had been painted shut many 
times over, barred their path. Rally smiled grimly. &quot;Quit your whining 
and help me get this open.&quot;

Cowboy stood and stared at Rally for a moment, then her lips set in a 
thin line. She nodded.
