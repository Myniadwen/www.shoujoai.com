<a href="../gunsmith/saddle-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>The rental car pulled into the parking lot neatly. 

&quot;You sure they&#146;re here?&quot; Cowboy asked. She looked around with obvious 
distaste.

&quot;Yeah, pretty sure.&quot; Rally commented dryly.

American hotels are a lot like Americans themselves. While they differ 
in taste and quality, on the whole, they have certain things in 
common&#133;but not much. This example of the trailer trash class of hotel, 
for instance, boasted &quot;Inddor Pool and Cab e.&quot; Paving in the parking 
lot was apparently extra, however.

&quot;Nice place he takes May to.&quot;

&quot;Not his usual class, I&#146;ll admit.&quot; Rally said. &quot;I wonder why he&#146;s 
here.&quot;

The two women left the car parked well away from the office, and 
slipped around the back of the hotel. As they climbed the stairs to 
the third floor, Cowboy wondered out loud, &quot;If this isn&#146;t his usual 
kind of place, how did you know to come here?&quot;

Rally gave a short laugh. &quot;Because it&#146;s May&#146;s usual place.&quot;

They approached Room 314 with guns drawn. At the door, Rally stopped, 
one hand extended to knock. At the sounds from within, Rally colored a 
little and Cowboy laughed. Rally grimaced and knocked.

&quot;May - you&#146;ve got to three to get off Ken and we&#146;re coming in.&quot; 

Both women laughed out loud at the scuffling from within. When the 
lock was opened, Rally and Cowboy entered. Rally stepped into the 
interior past Minnie May, and pointed her gun at Ken.

&quot;Sorry, Ken. We don&#146;t have time for pleasantries.&quot; Rally could hear 
the sound of Cowboy grabbing May and holding her back.

Ken smiled up from the bed. Before he had a chance to speak, May 
interrupted.

&quot;Dammit, Rally. I won&#146;t even go into the &quot;you have no right&quot; 
speech&#133;but get your gun out my Kenny&#146;s face or I&#146;ll blow you and your 
car to pieces.&quot;

Rally didn&#146;t budge. &quot;Who is it Ken? Where and how? We don&#146;t have time 
to play games.&quot;

Ken shrugged. &quot;It&#146;s a straightforward car bombing, and one building 
demo. The car bomb is rigged to go off at about 9PM and the building 
at about 3AM tomorrow, but&#133;&quot; he paused.

&quot;But what?&quot; Rally insisted.

&quot;But,&quot; Ken said smugly, &quot;I told May all this and she was going to tell 
you tonight when she got home.&quot;

Rally shot him a dark look, then holstered her gun. Cowboy must have 
let go of May, too, because the next thing she knew, Rally had been 
slapped pretty solidly by her partner and was sitting on the floor. 
Cowboy&#146;s snicker was almost inaudible. Almost.

&quot;What is WRONG with you?&quot; May asked indignantly. &quot;Do you think you 
need to pull a gun on Ken to get him to help you?&quot;

Rally stood up, rubbing her face and her ass. &quot;Hey, he&#146;s got a job to 
do - he might not feel like he needs to report in.&quot;

Ken nodded. &quot;As a matter of fact, I didn&#146;t like this one myself, but 
in my position, I didn&#146;t feel I could say no.&quot;

May glanced at Ken, then Rally, and hmphed off to the bathroom.

Ken smiled graciously and waved Rally to a chair. Rally glanced at the 
chair and declined. She didn&#146;t like the look of the stains on the 
upholstery. 

&quot;So, who&#146;s the car bomb?&quot;

Ken nodded. &quot;That&#146;s why I didn&#146;t like the job - it&#146;s someone high up 
in the Mayor&#146;s office. The Director of City Planning, in fact.&quot;

Rally looked back at Cowboy, who stood by the window, her gun still 
drawn. Cowboy let the curtain drop and spoke, as May came into the 
room fully dressed.

&quot;We got company.&quot; Cowboy said. 

Rally looked through the window, saw three men with drawn guns and let 
the curtain back down. &quot;Well, Ken. I think they think they don&#146;t like 
the sound of you, either.&quot;

Ken laughed. &quot;Par for the course. It&#146;s okay - I have a few tricks up 
my sleeve.&quot; Turning to May he nodded. She turned and left the room 
once more. 

&quot;This room does have a fire exit, doesn&#146;t it?&quot; Rally asked. 

Ken bared his teeth. &quot;This one does, yes. May and I made it a while 
back. If you cover us up here, I think we can flank them&#133;&quot; he rose, 
ignoring the two women in the room and walked naked across the floor. 
Drawing on his clothes quickly, he said, &quot;We&#146;ll meet you at your car 
in fifteen, okay?&quot;

Rally, her eyes fixed on the window, nodded. &quot;It&#146;s the Ferrari parked 
around the right. Can&#146;t miss it. If it hasn&#146;t been jacked.&quot; She smiled 
grimly.

At the snick of a door closing behind them, Cowboy looked over her 
shoulder. There wasn&#146;t any sign of another door, but these two women 
hadn&#146;t ceased surprising her yet. She patted herself down and came up 
with two extra magazines. 

&quot;Rall, you live an interesting life, y&#39;know that?&quot;

Rally laughed. &quot;That&#146;s an old Chinese curse you know.&quot;

&quot;Everybody knows that.&quot; Cowboy said, and hefted her gun.

***

As gunfights went, thought Cowboy, that one was pretty darn boring. 
She felt so strongly about it, she went so far as to say it out loud. 
Rally looked up from where she was going through one of the six 
gunman&#39;s jackets and agreed.

&quot;Can&#39;t get good help these days, for love or money.&quot;

Cowboy dragged one of the unconscious lackeys into the room, slung his 
body on top of the other four and stood, slapping her hands 
ostentatiously.

One had been brained by the door opening; another had a broken arm 
from the door closing, and a concussion from it opening again. Cowboy 
has taken out the third with a bullet across the hand and a left hook 
to the temple...funny how people always assume you should hit the jaw.

The three below couldn&#39;t have hit a stampede of prime beef, and Rally 
and she had taken them out with nearly no major injuries. One guy 
might never shoot again, but that wasn&#39;t any great loss.

&quot;What a mess.&quot; Cowboy commented as she stared down at the pile of 
thugs.

&quot;Less than usual.&quot; Rally commented. &quot;I bet they were only the 
vanguard. What do you say to braving the lion in its den?&quot;

Cowboy looked up sharply. &quot;Keaton?&quot;

Rally bared her teeth. &quot;Yeah. You know where the guns are made?&quot;

Cowboy shook her head. &quot;Nope. I never even saw one until I saw the 
ones they tore my place up with.&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot; Rally said and handed her a card. 

Cowboy read it out loud. &quot;Yu-Genics Labs? That&#39;s just plain gross. How 
does anyone get away with a name like that?&quot;

&quot;Illiterate government employees. C&#39;mon, Ken and May are waiting for 
us.&quot;

As they locked and closed the door behind them, Cowboy grinned a 
little. &quot;Uh, Rally, I guess we should probably be pretty loud as we 
get to the car, huh?&quot;

Rally looked at the other woman with a puzzled expression, then her 
face cleared. &quot;Oh. No. They&#39;re professionals. No problem.&quot; So it was 
with some shock that she turned the corner to find her rental car 
rocking on its tires.

***

Rally grit her teeth again before answering. &quot;I am NOT annoyed, so 
stop asking!&quot;

May leaned forward and leaned on the passenger seat. &quot;I don&#39;t know, 
you seem awfully annoyed.&quot;

&quot;Just because you and Ken here wasted about half an hour...&quot; Rally 
snarled.

&quot;Waste is in the eye of the beholder,&quot; May said with a giggle. Ken 
looked pointedly out the window, trying to be invisible, while Cowboy 
did her best to not to draw Rally&#39;s wrath towards herself. She toyed 
with the pagers and cell phones they had taken off the guys back at 
the hotel.

&quot;Say, Ken...&quot; Cowboy began, hoping to distract everyone from the 
quarrel that was brewing, &quot;Can you do anything with these?&quot; She held 
up a phone and waggled it around.

&quot;Do something?&quot; Ken asked. &quot;You mean like...&quot;

&quot;Well I don&#39;t know exactly, but I was thinkin&#39; that you and the little 
lady here might be able to do something useful with them.&quot;

Rally, watching in the rearview mirror, saw Ken and May exchange 
looks. Cowboy passed them the electronics and sat back, her arms 
behind her head.

Rally glanced at her. &quot;Good idea.&quot; The tall woman nodded, but said 
nothing. She watched Ken and May ripping the electronics apart and 
discussing the various explosives they had available.

&quot;Cowboy...&quot; Rally began, then stopped. &quot;We&#39;ll get this resolved. Clear 
up Lynda&#39;s death and&#133;.&quot;

&quot;Rall,&quot; Cowboy&#39;s voice was toneless. &quot;that&#39;s the past for me. I&#39;m more 
interested in my present.&quot;

Rally found her answer sticking in her throat. She looked at Cowboy 
out of the corner of her eye. Cowboy turned and gave her a meaningful 
look. Rally, caught in that look, almost drove off the road. The car 
bouncing over the rumble strips brought her attention back to the road 
ahead.

***

It looked more like a military unit than a laboratory. Guards were 
visible, and they assumed others were not visible. Two towers covered 
front and back, although they were disguised as a clock tower and a 
viewing platform. Rally counted at least half a dozen visible guards.

Ken put his hand on Rally&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I think this is my department. 
I can&#39;t go in with you anyway...you know....&quot; Rally nodded and Ken 
continued. &quot;May can handle anything once you&#39;re inside.&quot;

Rally looked at May. &quot;You know what you have to do?&quot; The blonde 
nodded. 

&quot;Okay then. Ken, you&#39;re up.&quot;

The three women faded back as Ken stood and walked towards the guards 
at the main entrance. He asked them for directions, bummed a cigarette 
of one and took out one of the cell phones they had purloined from the 
goons at the hotel.

Ken spent about ten minutes in easy conversation with the three 
guards, then thanked them, and turned away. May, who had left to plant 
a few charges of her own, now returned. They could see Ken take a last 
puff off the cigarette and throw it to the ground, grinding it out 
with his shoe. 

&quot;That&#39;s it - ten minutes from mark.&quot; May whispered. She led the other 
women to a shaded copse, which pressed up against the electrified 
fence. A gully ran below the fence and was covered in low brush. May 
turned to the others and explained. &quot;Ken left one of the phones with 
the guards...by accident. I&#39;ve got three charges that will blow the 
electrical connection to the fence, at the same time the phone goes 
off. We&#39;ll be able to get in here. Getting out will be a whole &#39;nother 
game.&quot;

&quot;If this goes right,&quot; Rally said, &quot;it won&#39;t be an issue.&quot;

They could hear the explosion at the gate from where they crouched. 
Rally pulled out a pair of wire cutters and snipped them a little hole 
in the fence. The three women wiggled their way under the fence and 
were in. They could hear shouting, but turned away towards the loading 
dock. People in work clothes were running towards the front gate. 
Rally, May and Cowboy hunched down under a truck and watched the 
hubbub.

When the loading dock was nearly empty, Rally slipped behind one of 
the workers and pointed her gun behind his ear. &quot;Don&#39;t move. Take me 
to where your uniforms are kept.&quot; The worker went to set his clipboard 
down, but Rally hissed at him to stop. &quot;You keep your hands where I 
can see them. Now walk.&quot; The three followed the worker, until he led 
them to a utility closet. Spare uniforms were kept neatly on 
industrial shelving and Rally smiled. &quot;Good. Now face the wall.&quot; The 
worker did so and Cowboy stepped up, slammed her gun on the back of 
his head, then caught him as he sagged.

&quot;I hate this shit,&quot; she muttered as she tied the worker hand and foot. 
&quot;I feel like one of the bad guys.&quot;

&quot;Pretend you&#39;re James Bond if you have to, but get him tied up.&quot; Rally 
finished zipping up the work overalls and opened the closet door. 
&quot;Come on,&quot; she said urgently.

The three women pressed on. They followed conveniently printed signs 
for the processing plant. When they arrived, the plant appeared nearly 
deserted. A few plainclothes guards stood smoking, but there was 
little other movement. Waving May to wait, Rally and Cowboy stepped 
forward, and greeted the guards.

Rally waved vaguely at Cowboy and muttered. &quot;Uh, this lady says she 
has an appointment to see Long.&quot;

The guards looked at Cowboy, then Rally. They stood in front of the 
door waiting, until Cowboy handed over a card. The shorter of the two 
guards looked at it, passed it to the other guy, then nodded. They 
parted to let Cowboy through, but the short guard slipped in front of 
Rally and glared down at her.

&quot;Don&#146;t I know you from somewhere?&quot; He asked suspiciously.

Rally shrugged. &quot;I&#146;m new here.&quot;

&quot;When d&#146;you start?&quot; The other guard demanded. &quot;What division? Who&#146;s 
your boss?&quot;

Rally looked up and caught Cowboy&#146;s eye. She looked up and smiled 
sweetly. &quot;C&#146;mon guys &#150; don&#146;t be mean. Maybe, if you&#146;re nice to me, we 
can be friends.&quot; The two guards relaxed their arms a little, letting 
the guns hang. Rally shrugged again, letting the Duo drop into her 
hand and bringing it up to the shorter guard&#146;s chin.

The other guard turned and was met with Cowboy&#146;s pistol between the 
eyes. &quot;Now, do like the nice lady says, and you won&#146;t get hurt.&quot; 

Minutes later, the two guards were tied together in a side office. 
May, Rally and Cowboy stepped into the main processing area&#133;and 
gasped.

It was empty. Not just empty of people - devoid of any equipment, 
debris or any other sign that the plant had ever been in use. May 
groaned comically. 

&quot;Guess there&#146;s no point in me blowing anything up,&quot; she said, 
obviously disappointed. A shot rang out and the three women dove to 
the ground. There wasn&#146;t anything to use as cover. Rally ducked her 
head as another shot came way too close for comfort. 

&quot;Wrong again, May. Do it.&quot;

May grinned and pulled several grenades from her pockets. Tossing a 
few in the general direction of the shots, she cheered as they went 
off and shouts could be heard.

&quot;Let&#146;s get out of here!&quot; Rally shouted. &quot;May, cover us!&quot; Cowboy and 
Rally got off a few shots as they backed out the door through which 
they had entered. May tossed another grenade, but didn&#146;t stay to see 
it explode. The three women ran as fast as they could, retracing their 
steps. Gunshots occasionally whizzed by. Twice, Rally turned a corner 
and laid down some cover fire, once Cowboy did. 

By they time they got outside, they pretty much had given up on 
subtlety. The pursuers had more ammo and more people, but Rally and 
Cowboy placed careful shots, taking out one guard after another. At 
last the wooded copse was within sight.

Rally turned to May and said, &quot;Get out of here. Go!&quot;

May stood for a moment, then nodded. She pressed several objects into 
Rally&#146;s hand, and sprinted for the trees and the cut fence. A few 
shots were sent in her direction, but the bulk of the fire was aimed 
at the two women with guns. Rally was quickly running out of ammo. 
More guards were coming from behind and she was getting itchy to be 
out of here. She glanced at the objects in her hand. Three pagers, all 
taken from the guys at the hotel.

&quot;Cover me,&quot; Rally said and stepped out from the corner. Sliding one of 
the pagers along the floor, she stepped back behind cover before the 
stunned guards could take a shot. &quot;And again, this way.&quot; She slid 
another of the pagers down the floor, and stood next to Cowboy. &quot;On 
three &#150; we go out the window, got it? One, two&#133;&quot;

Her &quot;three&quot; disappeared into sound of explosions at both ends of the 
hall. Cowboy and Rally both shot the door out from behind them, and 
ran across the office, shot out the window in front of them and tore 
for all they were worth.

Cowboy was limping, but she kept up with Rally. &quot;What the hell did 
they do to those pagers?&quot;

Rally grinned. &quot;Neat, huh?&quot;

Cowboy grinned back, ducking as bullets came too close. &quot;Yep.&quot;

The two women hit the fence at full speed and were up and over before 
the surprised guards noted that the electricity didn&#146;t seem to be 
functioning.

As they came across the small, forested area, they could hear dogs, 
but the screech of tires drowned out the noise. Rally held her gun 
ready, but the car that came up the road was her rental. Rally and 
Cowboy piled in and Ken took off as fast as the car could move, while 
guards, led by the dogs, spilled out onto the road behind them, 
shouting and firing weapons.
