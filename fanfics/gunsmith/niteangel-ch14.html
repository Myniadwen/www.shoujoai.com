<h1>Night Angels (part 14 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gunsmith/index.html">Gunsmith Cats</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gunsmith/niteangel-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>&quot;Ugghh! What a toilet this place is!&quot; Seras Victoria grumbled in disgust 
as the jeep that carried herself, Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent, Moria Hedgley, 
and William Collins, through the streets of downtown Roanapur. Almost 
everywhere they went, they could see row after row of bars, strip joints 
and brothels, while hustlers, shop-worn prostitutes, drug pushers and 
just ordinary people who lost faith in the city wandered about. &quot;From 
the appearances, it&#39;s as if Sodom and Gomorrah had found a new home on 
Earth!&quot;

&quot;It could certainly use an A-bomb cleaning, that much I know,&quot; Rally 
observed. &quot;We&#39;ll be lucky if someone doesn&#39;t try to either grab us or 
make a proposition.&quot;

&quot;Well don&#39;t worry too much about it, girls,&quot; Collins told the vampires. 
&quot;We should be out of this portion of town pretty quick. Believe me; I 
did a little scouting around before you guys came here. The better part 
of town should be up ahead.&quot;

&quot;It remains to be seen how much &#39;better&#39; that area really is, Mr. 
Collins,&quot; Moria added.

&quot;Oh just &#39;Bill&#39;, Miss,&quot; Collins put in, &quot;you can ask Rally about that. 
I&#39;m not exactly the &#39;formal&#39; type.&quot;

&quot;You can say that again,&quot; Rally mumbled, then added, &quot;It&#39;s a good thing 
Dad went out ahead of us to the hotel.&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Collins said. &quot;He had to make sure our third person got here 
safely. Wouldn&#39;t want to see her run into trouble here.&quot;

&quot;Her?&quot; Rally wondered why Collins would offer up such a clue. Then it 
dawned on her, &quot;Oh I see,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;Well, let&#39;s not waste 
time seeing the... sights, let&#39;s get to the hotel.&quot;

Collins agreed, and pressed the jeep further into the streets. 
Presently, they left the seedier section of the city and made their way 
to one of the more fashionable hotels on the island. As the drove to the 
entrance, they noticed Deepak Vincent waving to them - and he wasn&#39;t 
alone!

&quot;Hey Rally, how you doing?&quot; Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; Farrah called out, waving 
as well. &quot;Sorry to say you had to come here.&quot; She also noticed the other 
passengers in the jeep. &quot;Nice to see you again, Seras, although I wish I 
can say the same to you, Bill.&quot;

&quot;Well I guess none of us can be as lucky,&quot; Collins grumbled as he forced 
one of his smiles.

Despite her growing fatigue, Moria noticed the exchange and said, 
&quot;Excuse me, but am I missing something?&quot;

&quot;Oh sorry,&quot; Rally stumbled. &quot;Becky, this is Moria Hedgley, a friend of 
ours from England. Moria, Becky Farrah.&quot; She then changed the subject. 
&quot;So, what brings you to the ass-end of the world, Becky?&quot;

&quot;Oh... Sir Integra,&quot; the information expert said. &quot;She called me over in 
Chicago and hired me to help you out.&quot; Her expression then became 
serious, &quot;She mentioned that there&#39;s a new FREAK chip out there... and 
it may be in the wrong hands.&quot;

&quot;No shit, Becky,&quot; Rally said grimly. &quot;We were also told that you were to 
brief us about what to expect.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Becky said. &quot;Sir Integra gave me what we knew and 
told me to find out more. And believe me, what I found over the net 
about this Lagoon Company wasn&#39;t that good.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got worse,&quot; the dusky vampire added. &quot;We got run-off the road 
coming here... and I could&#39;ve sworn the driver of that Beemer that did 
it was Natasha Radinov.&quot;

Becky&#39;s face went white. &quot;But... but that&#39;s not possible!&quot; she gasped. 
&quot;She&#39;s dead, you saw to that a couple years ago, Rally!&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know, but me and Bill know what we saw,&quot; added Rally. &quot;Becky, do 
you think you can find out anything about Radinov after I shot her?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll have to be after the briefing, Rally,&quot; said Becky. &quot;Now I suggest 
we get ourselves checked-in before someone decides to rob us in front of 
this hotel.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about that, Becky,&quot; Vincent said. &quot;The neighborhood 
around here is well-patrolled... by one of the mob syndicates that run 
this city, most likely the Russian contingent. Seems that having the 
customers robbed is bad for business.&quot;

&quot;That must be one of the few times anyone is grateful for the Russian 
Mafia,&quot; Seras put in, &quot;but I seriously wouldn&#39;t rely on them. Believe 
me, when I was a constable in England, we had to deal with a small 
Russian mob near London. From what I found out, they could give the 
Italian mob a good lesson in brutality.&quot;

&quot;Point taken, Master,&quot; Rally nodded as the group made their way in.

A SMALL CATHOLIC CHURCH ON THE MAINLAND...

Natasha Radinov picked up the steaming cup and saucer from off the 
coffee table in front of her. Gradually, she takes a sip, her eyes 
closed. &quot;Marvelous,&quot; she says. &quot;As usual, Sister Yolanda, the tea you 
serve is lovely.&quot;

&quot;I am glad you like it, Natasha,&quot; an elderly nun who sat across the 
assassin, said in a gentle voice. Dressed in a traditional habit, the 
wrinkled face held a peaceful, kind look... provided the viewer looked 
past the black eyepatch over her right eye. &quot;It has been far too long 
since your last visit. I was beginning to wonder if you had died.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Radinov began, &quot;I ran into a little... trouble on one of my 
assignments and had to take a sabbatical from my job to recover. Believe 
me, it was nothing, just the nature of the business.&quot; She then looked 
past Sister Yolanda to the individual behind them. She was dressed in a 
similar habit, younger, blonde-haired, and staring at Radinov hostilely, 
the bubble gum she was chewing loudly smacking. &quot;A new acolyte, Sister?&quot; 
she asked, still trying to read this nun&#39;s eyes through her oddly-angled 
sunglasses.


Sister Yolanda turned to the younger nun. &quot;Sister Eda,&quot; she began, &quot;I 
believe you have something to do right now. Why don&#39;t you go outside and 
see to it?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Eda grumbled, still glaring at Radinov as she left.

The assassin chuckled as the nun left. &quot;A real spitfire, I see,&quot; she 
said, &quot;although you might want to show her how to dress herself so that 
her holster doesn&#39;t show.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll see to it, Natasha.&quot; Sister Yolanda then changed the subject, 
&quot;So, what is it that you need, my child? I have a new shipment of 
firearms if you&#39;re interested.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps.&quot; Radinov then produced a small list and handed it to the 
elderly nun. &quot;I&#39;ve been already given some armament from my newest 
employer, but found he is lacking in several models that I prefer. I was 
wondering if you&#39;ll be able to supply them to me. They are paying me 
quite generously and I can give you twice the asking price if you like.&quot;

Sister Yolanda looked over the list, nodding as she did. &quot;That will be 
not necessary, Natasha. I can supply you with what you need.&quot; She then 
sighed and added, &quot;At least I can sell them to you, unlike what happened 
the past few days.&quot;

Radinov looked concerned. &quot;Trouble?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid one of the local syndicates in Roanapur has taken a dim view 
on how I run business,&quot; sighed the nun. &quot;One of the smugglers I employed 
ran into a little trouble because of them and the shipment I was sending 
was seized. One of your countrywomen, I believe.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Radinov sighed. &quot;Well, perhaps after my obligations here are 
through, I could possibly... help you out with that little problem?&quot;

Sister Yolanda looked up to the assassin. &quot;You still take heroin as 
payment?&quot; she asked.

&quot;It can be arranged as such if you like,&quot; the assassin replied.

&quot;Very well, I will consider your offer. I will give this list to one of 
the workers and see if they can fill it for you.&quot; Sister Yolanda then 
slowly stood up.

&quot;One more thing,&quot; Radinov added, helping the elderly nun up. &quot;There 
is... another item I need that is not on the list. As long as I&#39;m here, 
do you think you can supply it to me?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Sister Yolanda asked.

XXX

During this discussion, Sister Eda just glared over at the convent, 
watching as a young man dressed in priestly garb helped some of the 
workers load sacks filled with illegal drugs into a watertight 
container. &quot;I don&#39;t like this, Rico,&quot; Eda said in a low, angry voice.

&quot;Whatever for?&quot; Rico asked, still his ever-smiling self. &quot;Look, Big Sis 
and Radinov are old friends, just don&#39;t get too bent out of shape 
because of it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not listening, are you asshole!?&quot; Eda snapped back. &quot;Look, I&#39;ve 
heard stories from some of my old contacts back in the states - like how 
Radinov was killed by that bounty hunter Rally Vincent in Chicago! And 
now Radinov shows up over here? I&#39;m... I&#39;m just concerned about Sister 
Yolanda, that&#39;s all!&quot;

Rico just looked oddly at Eda. &quot;I thought you&#39;ve burned your bridges 
with the C.I.A. long ago,&quot; he said.

&quot;Look, haven&#39;t I told you not to say THAT in front of me?&quot; the blonde 
hissed. &quot;As for your question... they&#39;re still burned. I just like to 
keep informed about these things, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Try telling that to Langley - if you ever meet him again,&quot; Rico 
smirked.

Eda was about to let loose with another retort when she caught sight of 
Sister Yolanda and Radinov exiting the convent, with the elder nun 
escorting the assassin to the car. Behind them, several workers carried 
several small pieces of weaponry and handed them to Radinov. Then Sister 
Yolanda handed several small plastic bottles to her old friend. &quot;Here 
they are, just as you asked,&quot; the elderly woman said, &quot;although it is 
somewhat unusual that you would ask for such items.&quot;

Radinov just looked into the sun and replied, &quot;You don&#39;t know when 
something like that would come in handy, that&#39;s all. Well, I will get 
out of your way then.&quot; With a small hug, she reentered the BMW and drove 
off.

After the car was out of sight, Sister Yolanda made her way to Eda and 
Rico. &quot;You were pretty rude to our guest, Sister,&quot; she said.

&quot;Sorry about that, it&#39;s just...&quot; Eda just shook her head as she added, 
&quot;I&#39;m not certain. Just call it worry.&quot;

&quot;Well, try not to let it bother you,&quot; the elder nun said as the church 
bells rang. &quot;Come now, it&#39;s time for mass.&quot; Eda nodded, but she couldn&#39;t 
rid herself of that strange feeling she had in her gut.

ROANAPUR...

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me?&quot; Rally groaned, standing inside the hotel 
room. Clearly Collins hadn&#39;t checked-out the hotel&#39;s accommodations 
before paying the clerk.

The d&#130;cor of the place was - to put it lightly - tacky. The color scheme 
of the place was all in red, with red satin sheets covering the single 
canopy bed in the room. Of course, that was before she saw the manicles 
that were on the headboard and footboard. Turning to the rather 
embarrassed A.T.F. agent, she growled, &quot;Is this your idea of a joke, 
Bill? You expect me and Master to sleep in here?&quot;

&quot;I happen to agree with you, Rally!&quot; Seras added, who was a little wary 
of the mirror that was affixed to the canopy of the bed. &quot;We&#39;re not a 
bunch of tarts here! This has got to be the wet dream of some damned 
bloody S&amp;M wanker!&quot;

&quot;Hey take it easy, girls!&quot; Collins said in his defense. &quot;It was the only 
rooms left that were adjoining each other! I mean, what about your 
friend Moria? She&#39;s the one Sir Integra put in charge of you! Do you 
want her to sleep on the floor? I mean... at least she deserves some 
place to sleep!&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ve say you&#39;ve done a bloody bad job at that, you damned stupid 
Yank!&quot; Moria grumbled, storming from her room using the adjoining door. 
&quot;Mine has a swing with a hole in a rather... embarrassing position on 
the seat! That place is enough to keep me awake for a week!&quot;

&quot;AW C&#39;MON GIRLS, PLEASE!?&quot; Collins pleaded, on his knees.

Rally just threw up her hands in exasperation, then looked at Becky, who 
she knew had a somewhat-normal room. &quot;Uh... listen...&quot; she stammered to 
her, &quot;why don&#39;t we...&quot;

&quot;Forget it, Rally!&quot; the information expert cut her off. &quot;I really don&#39;t 
think I would get as much sleep if I stayed in... here. Besides,&quot; she 
looked at her friend and Seras slyly, &quot;this might come in handy for you 
two.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; Seras looked over to Vincent, who was clearly blushing at the 
gaffe and said, &quot;At least while we&#39;re here, we should get this briefing 
started, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Uh... yes, Master,&quot; Vincent said, shaking his head. &quot;It least it&#39;ll 
take our minds off the rooms for a while.&quot;

The six then gathered around a table that was in the room as Becky 
booted-up her laptop computer and accessed some of her files. &quot;Okay,&quot; 
she began, &quot;Sir Integra asked me if I could find information about that 
company that&#39;s holding the chip, the Lagoon Company. It took me a while, 
but I was able to find out some information about the &#39;employees&#39;.&quot;

A picture came up on the display, showing a bald African American. &quot;Now 
this guy is the owner of the company. There&#39;s evidence that this guy 
used to be with the U.S.M.C..&quot;

&quot;&#39;Used to&#39;?&quot; Seras asked.

&quot;Well, details are a bit sketchy, but it seems he went AWOL right after 
South Vietnam fell... and never came back. From what we&#39;ve gathered, he 
been working as a merc around these parts since. He goes by the name 
&#39;Dutch&#39;, and founded the Lagoon Company after he purchased a World War 
II-era PT boat. Named it &#39;the Black Lagoon&#39;.&quot;

Another picture came up, a blonde man with blue eyes. &quot;Now this is 
Benjamin Lieb, also known as &#39;Benny&#39;. Graduated with top honors from 
California Polytechnic University in computer programming and 
networking, was doing graduate work over at M.I.T. doing the same when 
he ran into... a little trouble.&quot;

&quot;What sort of trouble?&quot; Rally asked.

&quot;I think I can answer that, Rally,&quot; Collins said, producing a file. 
&quot;Seems Lieb ran into a little trouble involving the F.B.I. and the 
Italian mob. Would&#39;ve ended-up &#39;six-feet-under&#39; as a result.&quot;

Rally and Seras perused the file Collins set down. &quot;Talk about miserable 
luck,&quot; the Draculina said. &quot;Any wonder he survived.&quot;

&quot;Just wait until you find out who rescued him, Seras,&quot; Becky said. She 
then brought-up another picture, this time of a brown-haired woman. 
Everyone almost gasped seeing this picture, which was obviously a mug 
shot. The woman&#39;s eyes looked cold, almost as if she was eyeing the 
photographer and wishing him - and anyone viewing the picture - dead.

It was a look Rally knew well: she had gotten that same look from almost 
every bail jumper she had brought in during her days as a bounty hunter. 
&quot;Not a very friendly person, I can say this much. Any information on 
her, Becky?&quot;

Becky nodded. &quot;Rebecca Xiang, alias &quot;Revy&quot;, alias &quot;Two-Hand&quot;. Born in 
New York City, lived in the streets of Chinatown for most of her life.&quot; 
She brought up another file, &quot;The rap sheet she has from the N.Y.P.D. 
alone could carpet a small apartment. There&#39;s no telling if she had any 
criminal record anyplace else.&quot; Becky read off the record, &quot;Arrested 
many times for armed robbery, assault, assault and battery, illegally 
discharging a weapon within city limits, and is suspected in the 
commission of several unsolved murders. This is one person nobody should 
associate with.&quot;

Seras sat back, thinking about what was disclosed. &quot;Hummph... what an 
assortment we have here: a Marine deserter, a renegade hacker, and an 
obviously-remorseless killer. We&#39;ve got our work cut-out here, 
everyone.&quot;

&quot;Hey wait, I&#39;m not done yet,&quot; added Becky. &quot;There&#39;s one more I have to 
show you - and he&#39;s the real oddball of this gang.&quot; She then tapped a 
few more keystrokes and produced one more file - that of young Japanese 
man.

Everybody did a double-take. &quot;I don&#39;t get it!&quot; Collins said. &quot;This guy 
looks like some sort of dweeb!&quot;

Moria then strained to make out the file, which was written in kanji. &quot;I 
think I can read this... but it may take a while. I know Japanese, but 
reading kanji is pretty hard. Gotta remember what these characters say.&quot;

&quot;Well wait just a minute and I&#39;ll make it easier for you. I&#39;ll just run 
this through the translation program.&quot; Becky then tapped out a few 
strokes, and after a few seconds the kanji characters took on a more 
comprehensive form. &quot;This looks like an employment record: Rokuro 
Okajima, last known employer was Asahi Heavy Industrial. Graduated in 
the middle of his class at Tokyo University, and had gotten his job at 
Asahi soon afterward.&quot; Becky looked further, &quot;It seemed he only entered 
college after passing the entrance exam the second time around. And from 
what I see, his employment record isn&#39;t that impressive - just your 
average wage slave, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;I would guess his bosses back at Asahi pushed this guy around, by the 
look on his face,&quot; Rally added, taking note of the hang-dog expression 
his picture had. &quot;How in the world he end up with the others?&quot;

&quot;He was kidnapped by them, that how,&quot; Becky said, pointing to another 
passage. &quot;The details of what happened afterward are sketchy - almost as 
if someone was covering-up something, but sometime afterward Okajima 
quit Asahi and joined the Lagoon Company.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s got to be &#39;Stockholm Syndrome&#39; at its extreme,&quot; Collins 
commented, &quot;otherwise, how in the world did what appears to be a decent 
person end-up with a bunch of pirates.&quot;

&quot;I guess we&#39;ll never know,&quot; Vincent added, and noticed Moria yawning 
further. &quot;Well, I think that&#39;s a mystery for another day. From the looks 
of it, it seems that, at least for the human portion of our little 
group, it&#39;s time for bed.&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; Becky said, stretching. &quot;I&#39;ll e-mail what I have to Sir 
Integra and head off myself. I&#39;ll see what I can find about Radinov&#39;s 
disposition in the morning.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Collins put-in, also stretching. &quot;Me and Mr. Vincent will be 
down the corridor if you girls need us.&quot;

&quot;Uh... Dad, about your room...?&quot; Rally asked, hoping her dad could 
exchange rooms.

&quot;Sorry Irene,&quot; Vincent said, &quot;but I don&#39;t think the d&#130;cor of this... 
room is to my taste. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll see if we can ask the management 
for better rooms tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Rally mumbled, examining one of the manacles on the bed. &quot;This 
has got to be the most embarrassing room I ever stayed in.&quot;

Moria was too tired to even come up with a witty retort to Rally&#39;s 
observation, instead dragging herself to her own room. She simply stared 
at the bed, thankfully missing the manacles Rally and Seras&#39; room had, 
then took a doubtful look at the sex swing hanging from the ceiling. &quot;I 
just hope I don&#39;t end-up catching some social disease sleeping in this 
bloody room,&quot; she groaned.

THE LAGOON COMPANY, AT THE SAME TIME...

Dutch was busying himself studying the intelligence that Balalaika had 
supplied through her contacts, hoping against hope that the threats Sir 
Integra had made were at least empty. Nearby, Benny studied the FREAK 
chip, which was still encased in its acrylic shell, trying to fathom the 
purpose of the device. Nearby, Rock was going over business receipts, 
calculating the company&#39;s expenditures and income, and trying to balance 
both. Revy was sprawled on the couch face down, seriously bored.

&quot;Oh for crying out loud,&quot; Dutch grumbled. &quot;This can&#39;t be good.&quot;

&quot;Find something?&quot; Benny asked, his attention taken from the chip.

&quot;Yeah, Benny-boy... we might be in worse trouble than we are right now.&quot;

Rock looked up from his figures. &quot;This Sir Integra... could she 
really... send someone after us?&quot; he asked nervously.

&quot;It looks like it.&quot; Even Revy took note, standing up to give her boss 
room to sit. &quot;Sir Integra has got a lot of resources in her hands, 
that&#39;s for certain. It would be a bit foolish she&#39;d send someone after 
us, but I wouldn&#39;t put it past her.&quot; He scratched his bearded chin and 
added, &quot;She did run into a bit of trouble a couple of years back and was 
imprisoned, though. But then the Queen of England pardoned her and she 
was back doing... whatever she does.&quot;

&quot;Well, if she thinks she can push us around,&quot; Revy smirked as she 
brandished her gun, &quot;then it&#39;s safe to say it will be the last thing 
that bitch will do.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get too cocky, Revy,&quot; Dutch cautioned. &quot;Sure, she lost a lot of 
soldiers long about, but when she got back on her feet, she hired the 
Wild Geese as her army.&quot;

&quot;The Wild Geese?&quot; Benny repeated, alarmed. &quot;That can&#39;t be good.&quot;

&quot;Uh... Dutch? Just what exactly are you talking about?&quot; Rock asked.

The burly African American straighten himself up as he began. &quot;The Wild 
Geese are a group of freelance mercenaries, traveling around the world 
as soldiers-for-hire. Not many of them, mind you... but they&#39;re good, 
possibly the best in the business.&quot; Straightening his ever-present 
sunglasses, Dutch added, &quot;During my own freelance days not too long ago, 
I happened to meet-up with their leader, Pip Bernadotte. He picked-up 
the family business when he left the French Army and hasn&#39;t looked back 
since. Pip&#39;s a bit of a &#39;devil-may-care&#39; guy; suave, and a bit of a 
girl-chaser. But he looks after his men... and they look-up to him.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Rock further implored, &quot;we might have a chance with this... Pip?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t say,&quot; Dutch shrugged. &quot;We might get off of this with our skins 
intact... maybe.&quot; Rock gulped.

&quot;That&#39;s just the nature of the business, Rock,&quot; Benny added. &quot;One day 
you can be his best friend drinking at some bar, and then the next he&#39;d 
be shooting at you. Nothing personal, mind you, it just depends on who&#39;s 
signing the checks.&quot;

&quot;You got that right, Benny,&quot; Revy put in. &quot;When it comes down to it, 
Rock, a merc&#39;s a merc - fighting to put your dinner on the table. Ideals 
and politics mean nothing on them - in the end, they&#39;re just in it for 
the money.&quot;

&quot;But even a merc will have his scruples,&quot; Dutch said. &quot;When you go 
around the world fighting one conflict after another, sometimes you see 
things you don&#39;t like too much. Then you might want to add your own 
feelings to the fight.&quot; He looks at the information again, &quot;The Geese 
have been in Sir Integra&#39;s employ for some time, which meant over a year 
ago, she and a bunch of &#39;specialists&#39; - at least that&#39;s what this says - 
made a trip from England to Chicago in the states. And they came back 
one person heavier - a bounty hunter named Rally Vincent.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?&quot; Revy gasped, surprised. &quot;Rally Vincent went with her?&quot; Then a 
grin came over her face, &quot;So it was her! Well now, I just might be 
looking forward to this Hellsing bitch sending over her boys - if one of 
them happens to be Rally Vincent.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s with you now, Revy?&quot; Dutch grumbled suspiciously.

&quot;She wants this Rally&#39; gun, that&#39;s what,&quot; Rock answered in a deadpan 
fashion. &quot;Revy, there&#39;s no guarantee that the people Sir Integra might 
send is going to be Rally Vincent.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Revy countered. &quot;Listen asshole, if I were this bitch Sir 
Hellsing, I would want to send the best people I have to get back that 
chip - and that would include Rally Vincent. And Rally would want to 
have the best piece in the world for her personal arsenal, so she&#39;s 
going to bring that CZ-75 of hers!&quot; She then reclined back, &quot;Oh yeah, I 
can just see the money that gun&#39;s going to get us right now.&quot;

&quot;Yeah? Well try to remember that SHE might be the one putting your ass 
six-feet-under, not her, Two-Hand,&quot; Dutch snapped, throwing the papers 
in her face. &quot;Why don&#39;t you, for once, think these things through! We 
might have an entire army coming down our throats and you&#39;re only 
thinking about a big score? Give me a break!&quot; Dutch then left the room, 
&quot;I&#39;m going for some fresh air, and then maybe we better figure out how 
we&#39;re going to get out of this mess!&quot;

Revy just snorted, returning to her daydreaming. Benny and Rock, 
however, exchanged looks of concern.

THE HELLSING MANSION, LONDON, AT THE SAME TIME...

&quot;Walter, make sure the jet at Heathrow is on the tarmac when I arrive,&quot; 
Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing barked out. Her butler, Walter 
C. Dolnez, walked beside the leader of the Hellsing Organization, his 
pace matching hers. &quot;I will be departing just as soon as we board.&quot;

&quot;I have already done so,&quot; Walter replied, holding up a wireless 
PDA/phone. &quot;Everything has been prepared and awaiting your arrival. I 
suppose you have the data Miss Farrah e-mailed to us at hand?&quot;

&quot;I have. Not too good, I might add,&quot; Sir Integra said, then noticed that 
Alucard had stood in front of the two.

&quot;Then, if you&#39;re not going to have me accompany you,&quot; the No-Life King 
said tursly, &quot;then I insist that you have at least a few bodyguards go 
with you.&quot;

Sir Integra looked a little surprised at her vampire servant. &quot;I have 
never known you to show such concern for my well-being before, Alucard.&quot;

Alucard shrugged, displaying his fanged teeth as he said, &quot;The feelings 
I have I usually keep to myself.&quot;

&quot;In any case,&quot; Sir Integra said, &quot;I am having Captain Bernadotte 
accompanying me to Roanapur. Will that satisfy you, Vampire King?&quot;

&quot;Barely,&quot; Alucard grumbled. &quot;You would bring that French idiot on this 
trip.&quot;

&quot;I say it is adequate,&quot; Sir Integra countered. &quot;Remember, Rally and 
Seras are there as well, as well as Agent Collins and Deepak Vincent.&quot;

&quot;So Miss Vincent&#39;s father is there as well,&quot; Walter observed. &quot;How 
convenient.&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot; Turning to the two, the Hellsing leader concluded with, &quot;If 
all goes well, I should all return within the week, with the chip. I 
leave the care of England to you two.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Master,&quot; Alucard purred, &quot;we&#39;ll make sure Iscariot doesn&#39;t 
allow their dogs to poop on the lawn while you&#39;re gone.&quot;

Groaning from the joke, Sir Integra grumbled, &quot;Just protect England, 
that is all I ask.&quot; Then turning away from them, she joined Pip 
Bernadotte in a limousine, then drove off.

As the limo made its way from the estate, Sir Integra took some time to 
open her laptop in order to study the information Becky had sent her. 
She took in what was presented, making mental notes as she did. Then she 
glanced over to the mercenary next to her, who had a look of concern on 
his face. &quot;Still think my going to Roanapur is a bad idea, Captain?&quot; she 
asked.

Pip nodded. &quot;I wish you would reconsider zese, Mon Commander,&quot; he said. 
&quot;Believe me, I&#39;ve been to Roanapur before, and I can tell you zat it eet 
is no place for a lady like you.&quot; He leaned closer to Sir Integra and 
added, &quot;Zat whole place is run by ze syndicates zat have zere operations 
in ze area! Even ze police are under zere control... barely! Please, I 
beg of you, leave zese mission to Mignonette and Rally! Zey can handle 
zese alone!&quot;

&quot;That group of pirates has taken property of the Hellsing Organization 
and holding it hostage, not to mention threatening to sell it to the 
highest bidder,&quot; Sir Integra countered. &quot;I do have faith in Seras and 
Rally, but I wish to personally see to it that they realize the errors 
in their ways!&quot;

&quot;As you wish, Mon Commander,&quot; Pip sighed, leaning back into the seat.

Sir Integra looked sympathetically at the mercenary and added, &quot;I 
realize that you are only looking after my welfare, Captain. If you are 
worried about how Alucard will react if I am harmed, then rest assured, 
I left instructions to Walter to deal with him if the worst were to 
occur.&quot;

&quot;Still, zat is cold comfort,&quot; Pip added.

They sat in silence for a few minutes, with the Hellsing leader 
occasionally glancing over to Pip. &quot;Still wishing that Seras would look 
upon you with favorable eyes - despite the fact that she&#39;s a lesbian - 
and in a relationship with Rally?&quot; Sir Integra asked.

A little surprised by the question, Pip managed to answer, &quot;In fact, eet 
is IN SPITE of that fact!&quot; He centered himself before continued with, &quot;I 
am a Frenchman - ze pursuit of la amour is more zan an idle hobby - it 
is an obsession!&quot; He chose his words correctly, &quot;Mon commander, I do 
realize you have romantic feelings for Mignonette, just like Rally... 
but eet would be loath for me to just geev-up on her because she has 
feelings for you two!&quot;

&quot;I would not expect less, Captain,&quot; Sir Integra said, smiling.

ROANAPUR, AT THE SAME TIME...

&quot;Hey, where are you?&quot; a young prostitute called out near a deserted 
street. &quot;Geez,&quot; she mumbled, &quot;that john wanted to meet here, but now I 
can find him! How in the world am I...&quot; but was cut-off when she heard 
someone cry out from behind a clump of bushes at the nearby park. 
Curious, the woman crossed the road and made her way inside... and froze 
at what she saw!

Several bodies laid on the ground, obviously dead. When the prostitute 
managed to find the courage to examine the bodies, she discovered that 
every one of them had two identical puncture wounds on the neck. Making 
up her mind to contact the police, the prostitute turned around - and 
screamed in fright.

Natasha Radinov was clutching her latest victim, possibly the 
prostitute&#39;s customer, her fangs sunk into his neck. Once she finished 
her meal, she allowed the body to drop, then turned her attention to the 
woman she heard screaming. &quot;Such a sweet, young thing,&quot; she slurred, 
intoxicated the amount of blood she consumed. &quot;Too bad I cannot allow 
you to tell anybody!&quot;

The prostitute barely had time to scream when Radinov grabbed her and 
plunged her fangs into her neck.
