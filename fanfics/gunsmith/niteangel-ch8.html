<a href="../gunsmith/niteangel-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>SERAS AND RALLY&#39;S QUARTERS, HELLSING MANSION, SUB-BASEMENT LEVEL, 2AM...

There were few pleasures that the two lesbian vampires of the Hellsing 
Organization could indulge in. Currently, the two were engaged in one of 
their favorites - bathing together. Usually, whenever Seras Victoria and 
Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent bathed, they would find themselves having sex with 
each other. This time it was different... there was time to satisfy 
their lusts later.

Sitting in the bathtub that Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing had 
generously given the two, Seras and Rally relaxed, with the dusky 
vampire sitting behind her master in the warm soapy water. Occasionally, 
Rally would gently fondle Seras&#39; large breasts but nothing more. Mainly, 
she would relax her head against the blonde&#39;s back and nuzzle her neck. 
&quot;I&#39;ve got to admit, Master,&quot; Rally finally said in a low voice, kissing 
the nape of Seras&#39; neck, &quot;I was a little nervous knowing that the 
Knights were watching me scare that fucking idiot Carl into spilling the 
beans about the FREAK chip. If you ask me, I think I was a little too 
convincing about the whole thing. I believe the Knights might have 
thought I was really going to drink that asshole&#39;s blood.&quot;

&quot;But you were able to control yourself the whole time, Rally. You really 
should be proud of yourself,&quot; the Draculina added, leaning back. &quot;Don&#39;t 
forget, as long as you&#39;re my fledgling, I can see whatever you can 
see... especially the look Sir Integra had on her face when you told her 
about your little flirtings with that maid.&quot;

Rally simply chuckled, then turned Seras&#39; head around to engage in a 
deep, lingering kiss that lasted at least thirty seconds, their tongues 
playing inside their mouths. After they broke off, she smiled and said, 
&quot;You know... it&#39;s been almost a year since I became a vampire. If it 
weren&#39;t for you guiding me... especially after what had happened at 
Bath... I might not have been able to cope the way I did.&quot;

&quot;Well, Master did help me with the other things,&quot; Seras quipped.

&quot;Yeah he did... whenever he wasn&#39;t acting all high-and-mighty and all 
that shit,&quot; Rally answered, &quot;but he wasn&#39;t there to help me over the 
rough spots - like after the Bath incident. I might have committed the 
vampire version of suicide if you hadn&#39;t forced me to take another look 
at things - and I thank you for that.&quot;

&quot;I just didn&#39;t want you to waste your second chance... as well as the 
fact that I am very fond of you,&quot; Seras said, turning around in the tub 
to face Rally. Embracing her, she added, &quot;Just remember that I care for 
you deeply, as much as I care for Sir Integra.&quot;

Rally chuckled. &quot;If only we can get you two together for one night, then 
it would be complete,&quot; she said, again kissing her, both of them sinking 
into the sudsy water.

A TOWER FLAT, WEST LONDON, EARLY AFTERNOON...

&quot;She hasn&#39;t woken up yet?&quot; Harold Morse asked his wife Elysse, both of 
them watching the young brown-haired girl they rescued the night before.

&quot;Afraid not, Harold,&quot; Elysse replied, shaking her head. &quot;She&#39;s been like 
this since we gotten her home.&quot; She then accompanied her husband into 
the living room, leaving the girl in the guest room of their flat. 
&quot;Granted, she was terribly scared because of last night, but this just 
isn&#39;t natural. I beginning to wonder if something else is wrong with 
her.&quot;

&quot;Well... whatever it is,&quot; Harold added, &quot;I hope it resolves itself soon. 
I really like to know whatever happened to her parents back there.&quot; 
Quietly, the couple made their way out of the room and closed the door.

Looking out the flat&#39;s window, Elysse added, &quot;In the meantime, we better 
find out who her parents are, and if they really are alive. It might 
help her so much.&quot;

A few minutes later, Harold prepared to exit the flat, kissing his wife 
goodbye. &quot;I&#39;ll see if after work, I can inquire to the police about what 
we had reported last night,&quot; he said. &quot;I trust you&#39;ll stay with her.&quot;

&quot;Of course I will, love,&quot; Elysse replied. But then, a strange look came 
over her face. &quot;Oh my I forgot - I need to pop over to the market to get 
things for dinner later on.&quot; Then looking across the hall, at a door in 
front of theirs, she added, &quot;Thankfully, I think I might know of someone 
who could be able to watch over the girl while I do.&quot;

&quot;You mean Jenn, the girl whose now living with Mrs. Wooley?&quot; Harold 
asked, looking at the door as well. Elysse nodded in the affirmative. 
&quot;Good. I&#39;ll see you tonight, then.&quot; Harold then left for the elevator.

After the doors closed, Elysse walked across the aisle and knocked on 
the door. A woman in her early 50&#39;s then answered the door. &quot;Oh Mrs. 
Morse,&quot; the woman - Emma Wooley - replied, &quot;it&#39;s so good to see you. 
What can I do you for?&quot;

&quot;Well, for starters,&quot; Elysse began, &quot;I was wondering how your 
granddaughter Jenn is holding up since moving in with you?&quot;

Emma looked a little sad and said, &quot;She&#39;s better, but still in a bit of 
a shock. A real tragedy, my son and his wife dying in that traffic 
accident two weeks ago. Poor Jenn, I&#39;m all the family she&#39;s got left.&quot;

&quot;It is sad,&quot; Elysse added glumly. &quot;Listen, we had to take in a little 
girl last night. Seems that something similar had happened to her 
parents. I was wondering if I could talk to Jenn for a little.&quot;

&quot;Of course, dear,&quot; Emma said, then turned inside and said, &quot;Jenn... I 
was wondering if you would come to the door for a while.&quot;

&quot;Alright, Gram,&quot; a young girl&#39;s voice answered from inside. Seconds 
later, a teenaged girl, with long blonde hair and blue eyes, appeared in 
the doorway. &quot;Oh... you&#39;re Mrs. Morse! Gram&#39;s been talking a lot about 
you ever since I got here.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Elysse began. &quot;I understand you&#39;ll be attending school in London 
soon.&quot;

&quot;Sure am,&quot; Jenn answered, &quot;although it just wouldn&#39;t be the same without 
Mum and Dad around. Is there anything you want?&quot;

Elysse centered herself and began, &quot;Well, it seemed that last night, we 
came across a little girl, apparently alone in the world. My husband 
Harold is going to find out if the police can locate her parents, and I 
just found out I need to go to market later on. I was wondering if you 
would be able to watch out for her while I&#39;m gone. I think she might 
benefit from someone who has endured similar circumstances. We&#39;ll even 
pay you - &#156;10.50 for starters.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;ll be glad to,&quot; Jenn said eagerly.

&quot;Good. I&#39;ll knock on the door when I&#39;m ready. I&#39;ll see you then, Jenn,&quot; 
Elysse said.

&quot;Thank you very much, Mrs. Morse. I&#39;ll do a good job, I promise,&quot; the 
girl bubbled, waving goodbye. As soon as the door closed, Jenn leaned 
against it, eyes happily gleaming. &quot;You were right about this place, 
Gram,&quot; she told Emma. &quot;The people around here are so friendly. A shame 
Mum and Dad haven&#39;t had a chance to meet them.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t dwell too much on the past if I were you, dear,&quot; Emma wisely 
said, hugging her granddaughter. &quot;In fact, I think that this is just the 
beginning of your adventures here, Jenn.&quot;

&quot;I hope so, Gram,&quot; Jenn sighed, hugging her grandmother in turn.

SERAS AND RALLY&#39;S QUARTERS, HELLSING MANSION, SUB-BASEMENT LEVEL, EARLY 
EVENING...

The sun had yet to set over the horizon, but Rally was already awake, 
lying nude in the coffin/bed she shared with Seras. Even though the lid 
was closed, the dusky-skinned vampire could see clearly the naked form 
of her sleeping master, peaceful as she slept. Eyes looking dreamily, 
Rally gently brushed away a stray lock of Seras&#39; spiky blonde hair away 
from her eyes. &#39;Even asleep like this, she&#39;s like an angel,&#39; Rally 
thought to herself. &#39;I may live for over a thousand years, possibly most 
of it alone - but for now, I&#39;m just as happy if I can share a portion of 
it with her.&#39;

For a few minutes more, Rally continued to watch over Seras, smiling as 
she did. But soon, the smile quickly faded when an odd sensation began 
to take hold over her. All of a sudden, she could feel the fangs in her 
mouth lengthening, as if getting ready to feed - but she was not hungry! 
&#39;What the hell...&#39; was all Rally could think about as her attention was 
once again upon Seras... only this time, she was hungrily eyeing the 
Draculina&#39;s neck!

It felt as if Rally was no longer in control of her actions, as she 
found herself creeping closer to Seras as not to awaken her. Just as 
slowly, she bent over towards her master&#39;s neck, her mouth open, 
preparing to strike. But just as Rally was about to plunge her fangs 
into Seras&#39; jungular vein - she freezed, visibly forcing herself not to 
attack! &quot;No,&quot; Rally whispered, virtually willing her jaws to close, 
&quot;I... will... not... attack my master!&quot; Almost violently, she forced 
herself away from Seras, then hit the switch which controlled the lid. 
Just as soon as it opened, Rally rolled herself onto the cold stone 
floor. &quot;What... what the fuck just happened to me?&quot; she gasped, closing 
the lid. &quot;For a minute, I was about to bite Master in the neck!&quot; Finally 
acknowledging her nudity, Rally forced herself into the shower, which 
she quickly cleaned herself, dressed in her usual garb and left the 
room... before the sensation would appear again.

XXX

Walter C. Dolnez, butler for the Hellsing family, was finishing-up his 
preparations for his rounds for the night. He had already thawed the 
packets of donated blood for Seras and Rally, as well as Alucard. He had 
placed the packets on ice and was preparing to depart when he heard a 
knock on his door. &quot;Now that is sort of unusual,&quot; the old butler 
remarked to himself as he went to answer, &quot;I would rather think that Sir 
Integra would avoid this room.&quot;

Then he opened the door. &quot;Why Miss Vincent,&quot; he began, mildly surprised 
to see Rally standing in the doorway, &quot;why in the world would you be up 
so soon?&quot;

&quot;Later, Walter,&quot; Rally answered crisply. &quot;Got any blood thawed-out?&quot;

Still a bit surprised, Walter pointed-out to the cart with the supplied 
blood. Going to the cart, Rally grabbed one of the bags and drank it in 
a few seconds. Discarding the bag, she turned to the butler and asked, 
&quot;Walter, have you, in your experience of being a vampire hunter, found 
any instance of a fledgling attacking his or her master for her blood?&quot;

&quot;Hmm... not to my knowledge, Miss Vincent,&quot; the old butler replied, then 
offered, &quot;I do know that masters would allow their fledglings to feed 
upon them to free them, but not in the context which you offered. Why do 
you ask?&quot;

Sitting down at the table, Rally sighed and began, &quot;Because when I woke 
up, I suddenly found myself resisting a powerful urge to reach over and 
bite Master in the neck... and I wasn&#39;t even hungry!&quot;

&quot;I must say, that is quite unusual. I had never encountered such 
behavior in any vampire I had faced.&quot; Walter then added, &quot;Have you 
talked to either Sir Integra or Alucard about it yet?&quot;

&quot;Well, not yet to Integra,&quot; replied Rally. &quot;As for Alucard... I think I 
better do that as a last resort. I just hope that this is just a passing 
thing or some minor quirk.&quot;

&quot;One should hope so,&quot; Walter mused. &quot;Are you feeling that urge again 
while I am around?&quot;

Rally just shook her head. &quot;Thankfully, no... and even if I did, I know 
you&#39;d be able to defend yourself.&quot; Getting up and stretching, Rally made 
her way to the door. &quot;Thanks for the help anyway, Walter. I&#39;ll be 
showing myself out.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not going to scare that poor girl again, are you?&quot; Walter 
commented dryly.

&quot;Who me?&quot; the dusky vampire quipped in mock surprise. &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m 
deliberately trying to frighten her. I guess she&#39;s not used to another 
woman finding her so attractive, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Or that the woman that finds her attractive is also a vampire,&quot; the old 
butler countered as Rally left. Shaking his head, Walter sighed, &quot;These 
young people these days.&quot;

XXX

Moria Hedgley, an attractive, twenty-three year-old brunette, worked her 
way dusting the various paintings and other treasures that dotted the 
walls and corridors of the Hellsing estate. Taking note of the darkening 
skies outside the window. &#39;The sun will be down soon,&#39; the young made 
thought to herself, shaking. &#39;And then... SHE will appear! Oh why does 
she torment me so much? If it wasn&#39;t for the fact about my grandfather 
working here, I would&#39;ve left ages ago!&#39; She then noticed that her 
trembling hands had knocked-over a vase from its perch. Quick as a cat, 
she grabbed the falling pottery and replaced it.

Quickly finding a seat, Moria then sat herself down and tried to relax 
herself. &quot;Calm down, Moria you fool,&quot; she told herself, &quot;you nearly 
gotten yourself in trouble with the lady for being so clumsy!&quot; Take a 
few deep breaths, she forced herself to stop shaking. &quot;No... I&#39;m not 
going to let her rattle me so easily! It&#39;s only a few minutes left in 
the shift, then I&#39;m going back to my flat and relax until the end of the 
weekend!&quot;

&quot;Hi, Moria,&quot; a female voice called out from behind.

&quot;AAAHHHHHH!!!&quot; the girl shrieked in terror. &#39;No... it can&#39;t be... try to 
pull yourself together, you fool!&#39; she bawled herself out in her mind. 
Eyes wide in fear, Moria slowly turned her head to the right... and 
found Rally leaning against a hallway entrance.

&quot;Happy to see me?&quot; the dusky vampire quipped, smiling. Moria&#39;s eyes, 
tears of fear streaming out, only widened more.

XXX

Sensing the onset of darkness, Seras roused herself from her death-like 
sleep and reached over to the other side of the bed... only to find it 
empty. &quot;R-Rally?&quot; she mumbled, turning around to see the space usually 
occupied by her fledgling/lover was vacant. &quot;Now why in the world would 
be wake up without me?&quot;

Discreetly, she made an inquiry into Rally&#39;s mind, then smiled, &quot;Oh... 
she&#39;s with Moria again, is she?&quot; she smirked, then sighed, &quot;Oh well... 
it looks like I have to play the spoilsport again. I&#39;m going to have to 
talk to her about scaring the poor girl again... although she doesn&#39;t 
mean to.&quot; But as she got up, she caught another impression from Rally&#39;s 
mind. &quot;Something&#39;s... happened with Rally... but what?&quot;

XXX

Moria nearly screamed again when Rally embraced her from behind. 
&quot;Please,&quot; she whimpered, tears continuing to stream from her face, &quot;I so 
wish to live. Don&#39;t kill me.&quot;

&quot;Kill you?&quot; Rally asked, genuinely surprised. &quot;Now why do I want to do a 
stupid thing like that?&quot; she purred, nuzzling the back of the attractive 
maid&#39;s neck.

Moria only cringed, feeling Rally&#39;s head so close to a very vulnerable 
point. &quot;Because you&#39;re a vampire,&quot; she cried, her trembling worsening. 
&quot;You exist by drinking human blood! You wish to drink MY blood... to... 
kill me.&quot;

Now realizing that she was frightening the girl needlessly, Rally spun 
Moria around, which frightened the girl more seeing Rally&#39;s blood-red 
eyes. &quot;Believe me, Moria... I hate the thought of killing another human. 
I&#39;ll only do that if given an order from Sir Integra. And as for 
drinking your blood, I&#39;ll only do that if you offer it to me.&quot;

&quot;Why should I believe that?&quot; Moria countered, her gaze turning steeling. 
&quot;My grandfather, Peter Fargason, fought and died for this organization 
to try to obliterate your kind from the face of this earth! And I would 
gladly see you blown away and scattered into so many ashes!&quot; she further 
snarled. &quot;You insult everything he believed in his life!&quot;

Rally felt hurt. &quot;I hunt vampires, too,&quot; she added. &quot;And even if they&#39;re 
not those chipped imitations, I would never allow even a true vampire to 
hurt another human!&quot; She then embraced Moria, causing her to jump, &quot;I 
won&#39;t hurt you... you&#39;ve got to believe that.&quot;

&quot;Please... y-y-you&#39;re cold... so cold,&quot; Moria whimpered, her trembling 
worsening.

&quot;Rally, is there something wrong?&quot; Seras&#39; voice called out from behind 
Rally. Suddenly, the sensation she had experienced earlier flared-up 
again, forcing Rally to release Moria. The maid then raced out of the 
room, hiding around the bend.

&#39;Oh crap... not again?&#39; Rally thought, frantically willing her fangs not 
to lengthen - and failing. &quot;It&#39;s... really nothing, Master,&quot; she managed 
to say, noticing Seras. &quot;Just... a case of bad timing, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Are you certain?&quot; the yellow-uniformed Draculina questioned further. 
&quot;You&#39;re talking a little funny right now.&quot;

&quot;No... it&#39;s really nothing,&quot; Rally said, the urge growing stronger by 
the moment. &quot;Now please... I like to be alone now...&quot;

&#39;She wants to be... alone?&#39; Moria thought, curious at Rally&#39;s sudden 
change-of-mood. She even noticed that the dusky vampire seemed to be 
trembling - and even flinched when Seras went to touch her shoulder. 
Feeling she was intruding on a delicate moment, Moria decided to leave, 
hoping to catch Sir Integra.

&quot;Rally,&quot; Seras continued to say, &quot;don&#39;t feel ashamed about Moria. I 
really don&#39;t care about that. What I am concerned about is that you were 
not in bed with me this evening.&quot;

&quot;Believe me, Master,&quot; Rally whimpered, the sensation growing stronger by 
the second, &quot;I would like to tell you. It&#39;s just that... that...&quot; 
Abruptly, the dark-haired vampire stopped trembling, and appeared to 
relax as well.

Now Seras was concerned. &quot;Rally?&quot; she asked. She didn&#39;t answer.

Instead, Rally slowly turned around. Her face was unreadable; her eyes 
glassy, as if in a trance. &quot;Rally?&quot; Seras again asked, feeling uneasy, 
&quot;W-what&#39;s wrong? Why aren&#39;t you saying anything?&quot; Again, the dusky 
vampire didn&#39;t answer as she slowly walked in front of her master.

Abruptly, Rally grabbed Seras by the shoulders and pushed her against 
the wall, her face still expressionless. &quot;RALLY, WHAT HAS GOTTEN INTO 
YOU!?!&quot; Seras demanded, but was instead met by the high collar of her 
uniform being torn-off, then Rally lunging towards her neck - only to be 
restrained by Seras.

&quot;RALLY... STOP IT! I ORDER YOU!!!&quot; the Draculina shouted, again getting 
stony silence for her fledgling. It seem that Rally was running on 
automatic as she struggled with Seras, the fledgling&#39;s fangs edging 
closer the blonde vampire&#39;s neck.

&#39;This is madness! How can she be doing this?&#39; Seras thought frantically. 
&#39;I hope that you can forgive me for doing what I&#39;m about to do, Rally... 
but you&#39;re leaving me no choice!&#39; Summoning every iota of will power she 
had, the Draculina focused it in one single thought as she shouted, 
&quot;RALLY - STOP!!&quot;

The effect was immediate. &quot;AAAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!!&quot; the dusky vampire 
shrieked in pain as she grasped her head, stumbling backward before 
falling to the floor. Rally continued to writhe in agony, apparently 
gasping for breath.

&#39;Oh dear... I&#39;ve hit her with too much power!&#39; Seras thought in horror, 
seeing Rally suffer.

As if on cue, several members of the Wild Geese, led by Pip Bernadotte, 
came racing down the corridor and into the parlor. &quot;We heard a 
commotion,&quot; the one-eyed Frenchman began, &quot;Is there... mon dieu.&quot; Pip 
could only gape in amazement, seeing Rally in the state she was in. 
&quot;Mignonette,&quot; he continued turning to Seras, &quot;how did zese...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll explain later!&quot; Seras said breathlessly, trying to straighten her 
torn collar. &quot;I&#39;m going to find Walter! Just... just keep an eye on her, 
alright?&quot;, still in distress over what she did.

&quot;Oui,&quot; Pip answered, not believing what he was he heard or saw. As soon 
as Seras had left, he walked over to Rally, who was beginning to 
recover, and asked, &quot;What happened?&quot;

Gathering her wits, Rally could only shake her head, bloody tears 
streaming down her face. &quot;I wish... I knew, Pip,&quot; was all she said.

XXX

&quot;But could you not do something about her? Lock her away or chain her up 
at least?&quot; Moria pleaded to Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who 
was outside with the maid awaiting the taxi. &quot;She terrifies me so much!&quot;

&quot;I appreciate your concerns, Miss Hedgley,&quot; the pale blonde woman 
reassured, &quot;but the fact remains: Rally Vincent is one of my most valued 
agents, and I will not do anything to harm her.&quot; She then placed a hand 
on Moria&#39;s shoulder and added, &quot;The best that I can do is go to her and 
try to ask for her to keep her distance from you for at least a few 
days, then maybe broach your concerns the best I could.&quot;

Moria sighed discouragily. &quot;I guess that is the best that I can hope 
for,&quot; she said.

Sir Integra nodded. &quot;Look - take a few days extra off to relax if you 
like. You have earned enough so you will not lose any pay. Call me when 
you&#39;re ready to return.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you, Sir Integra,&quot; Moria said, &quot;I will do just that.&quot;

&quot;Good girl,&quot; the Hellsing leader breathed, noticing the cab coming up to 
the drive. &quot;I will ask Walter to try to cover for you while you are 
gone.&quot;

&quot;Yes... and don&#39;t worry, Sir Integra - I WILL return.&quot; Moria then 
boarded the cab, which headed its way out of the drive.

Sir Integra paused for a few moments, taking in the darkening skies some 
more. &#39;Sometimes, for the life of me,&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;I will 
never understand the values and motivations of vampires, more-or-less 
their emotions. Having to deal with Alucard is bad enough, but to 
understand your best friend... that is another matter entirely. Oh well, 
hopefully things between those two will resolve themselves in time.&#39;

With a heavy sigh, Sir Integra decided that delaying the paperwork back 
at her desk was a futile gesture and returned inside. But just as soon 
as she arrived in the mansion, she was greeted by Walter, with Seras 
behind him. &quot;Sir Integra,&quot; the butler began, &quot;I am afraid we have got a 
serious situation on our hands!&quot;

&quot;Well whatever it is,&quot; the pale blonde woman began, &quot;is it so urgent 
that...&quot; She then saw the torn collar on Seras&#39; uniform. &quot;MY GOD!!! WHAT 
HAS HAPPENED TO YOU, SERAS?!?&quot;

&quot;I am afraid that is the situation,&quot; Walter began uneasily. &quot;It seems 
that Miss Victoria was attacked some time ago... by her own fledgling.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?!&quot; gasped Sir Integra, shocked.

&quot;Earlier this evening, she had approached me with a story that she had 
averted attacking Miss Victoria in their bed,&quot; the butler added. &quot;I know 
I should have approached you with this, but at the time I did not think 
it was that urgent.&quot;

&quot;Sir Integra, please don&#39;t be cross at Rally,&quot; Seras pleaded. &quot;I don&#39;t 
believe Rally had known what she was doing when she attacked me. Her 
eyes... they were vacant, as if she were in some sort of trance.&quot;

&quot;That remains to be seen,&quot; Sir Integra snarled, alarmed that her friend 
would do such an action. &quot;Where is Rally?&quot;

&quot;Currently in the parlor,&quot; Walter answered. &quot;Pip and several of his men 
are watching her as we speak.&quot;

&quot;I am going there. Seras, see to it that your uniform is changed,&quot; Sir 
Integra said as she began briskly walking to the parlor. However, any 
anger she had before entering faded immedietly. She could see Rally 
sitting forlornly against the wall, knees drawn-up to her chest, where 
she rested her head. Silently, she motioned Pip to her side. &quot;How is 
she?&quot; she asked.

&quot;To be honest... miserable,&quot; the Frenchman said in a low voice. &quot;Believe 
me, I never seen her like zese.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Sir Integra said, nodding. &quot;Very well Captain, you and your men 
are dismissed. Continue with your training as usual.&quot;

&quot;Oui, Mon commander,&quot; Pip said, saluting.

As soon as the Wild Geese had left the parlor, Sir Integra walked beside 
Rally, then sat herself down in the same manner as her friend. &quot;Do you 
care to explain what had happened, Rally?&quot; she began.

&quot;I&#39;m not certain,&quot; Rally moaned, not meeting Sir Integra&#39;s gaze. &quot;All I 
know is that, one second I&#39;m fighting the urge to bite my master in the 
neck, the next I&#39;m rolling on the floor feeling like I had a blast 
furnace in my head. In-between, it&#39;s just a blank.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps I can fill that in for you - but I do not believe you will like 
what I have to reveal,&quot; the Hellsing leader said. &quot;It seems that, during 
the time you could not recall your actions, you had attacked Seras 
Victoria, ripped the collar from her uniform and tried to drink her 
blood.&quot;

&quot;Noooo,&quot; the dusky vampire whimpered, burying her head in shame for a 
few seconds, afterwhich she looked up to her friend and said, &quot;Integra - 
lock me away! Find the deepest, darkest cell in this place and bury me 
in it! I... I don&#39;t think I can trust myself anymore if I continue 
to...&quot;

&quot;Rally... stop that!&quot; Sir Integra said firmly. &quot;I realize the agony you 
are in right now, but it is not time for acting rash!&quot; Standing up, then 
offering Rally up, she continued. &quot;I need to know right now if you are 
currently feeling the same sensation at this moment.&quot;

&quot;Well... no, not right now,&quot; Rally said, &quot;but what if that doesn&#39;t last? 
I don&#39;t want to hurt anybody, especially my master.&quot;

&quot;Of that fact, we agree,&quot; Sir Integra added. &quot;Now listen Rally... I want 
you to go down to the lower cells and talk to Alucard.&quot; She could see 
Rally cringing upon his mention, &quot;Now I realize that he can be extremely 
irritating, but he is also one of the oldest vampires in this world. He 
may have seen this behavior before and may have some insights about it 
that we do not.&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Rally replied, &quot;when I told Walter about this about this, he 
made that same suggestion, and I told him I would consider talking to 
Alucard as a last resort.&quot;

&quot;Well, I say you have arrived at that place, Rally,&quot; the Hellsing leader 
said warmly. &quot;Very well, find out what he has to say - and by the way, I 
will have to ask you to try and go easy with Moria Hedgley. Your pursuit 
of her is wearing her nerves thin.&quot;

Rally thought for a moment. &quot;I guess I have been coming on a little 
strong around her lately. Okay, I&#39;ll go see Alucard and find out what he 
has to say, not to mention taking your advice about Moria.&quot;

&quot;I will await the results,&quot; Sir Integra said as she left the parlor.

As for Rally, she simply drawn up her jacket and said to herself, &quot;I&#39;m 
so not looking forward to this. How do I get myself into these messes?&quot; 
Taking a deep breath, she then made her way to the lower levels of the 
mansion.

A TOWER FLAT, WEST LONDON, EVENING...

The door to the Wooley&#39;s home sounded with a knocking. &quot;I&#39;ll get it, 
Gram,&quot; Jenn happily said. Opening the door, she found Elysse Morse 
waiting. &quot;It&#39;s Mrs. Morse, Gram. I&#39;ll be leaving now.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully, I won&#39;t be too long, Emma,&quot; Elysse said. &quot;I&#39;m just going to 
the market, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Okay. Now have a good time, Jenn,&quot; came Emma&#39;s answer.

&quot;I will, Gram,&quot; the teen replied as she left the flat with Elysse.

&quot;Hopefully, I won&#39;t be gone too long,&quot; the young woman said to Jenn, 
&quot;but in case I&#39;m delayed, I&#39;ll make sure you get paid for the extra 
time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay, Mrs. Morse,&quot; Jenn replied. &quot;By the way, where&#39;s the girl?&quot;

&quot;In the guest room,&quot; Elysse said. &quot;I&#39;m not certain, but I believe she 
has finally gotten up.&quot;

&quot;Sort of odd that someone would sleep during the day,&quot; the teen 
observed.

Elysse nodded in agreement. &quot;True, but I believe all the stress of the 
previous night may have exhausted the poor dear.&quot; Picking up her purse 
and gathering up her coat, she made her way to the door. &quot;Now the 
emergency numbers are near the phone just in case. I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot;

&quot;Okay, Mrs. Morse. See you soon.&quot; Jenn then closed the door behind 
Elysse. &quot;Now, I&#39;ll just check on that little girl.&quot;

Going over to the guest room, the teen gently rapped on the door. 
&quot;Y-yes?&quot; a timid voice piped up.

&quot;It just me, little one,&quot; Jenn answered. &quot;Could I come in?&quot;

&quot;Um-hmm,&quot; came the answer.

Jenn opened the door, and through the darkness made out the form of what 
appeared to be a six year-old girl, her back turned away from the door. 
The teen&#39;s hand went for the light switch, only to hear, &quot;No, please 
leave it off,&quot; still not looking.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Jenn breathed, not wishing to upset the girl. &quot;Uh... I was 
wondering, do you have a name?&quot;

After a brief pause, &quot;Angela,&quot; answered the girl.

&quot;That&#39;s a lovely name,&quot; Jenn replied. &quot;So, do you want to tell me what 
happened.&quot;

Angela paused for a minute. &quot;Monsters ate my mummy and daddy,&quot; she 
morosely said.

&#39;I guess she must&#39;ve seen burglars and they killed her mum and dad,&#39; the 
teen though, &#39;and I guess it traumatized her so much, she made of this 
story do deal with it.&#39; Sighing, Jenn offered, &quot;I guess I can understand 
how you feel. You see, I lost my mum and dad in a motorcar accident two 
months ago. I&#39;m living with my Gram now, and I&#39;m looking forward to 
going to school next term.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s sad,&quot; Angela replied, still not turning her head. &quot;What&#39;s your 
name?&quot;

Smiling, the teen replied, &quot;Jennifer Wooley, but you can call me &#39;Jenn&#39; 
if you like. Everybody else call me that.&quot;

There was another round of silence, then Angela asked, &quot;Jenn?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

Briefly turning her head but not completely around, the little girl 
asked, &quot;Could you sit next to me while you&#39;re here?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be glad to,&quot; Jenn said. &quot;But it would help if I turn on the 
lights.&quot;

&quot;No, I rather you didn&#39;t,&quot; Angela said, again turning round. &quot;The dark 
feels better.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; Jenn replied, still a little mystified as she entered the room.

HELLSING MANSION, SUB-BASEMENT LEVEL...

If the truth were to be told, Rally would prefer not to visit Alucard. 
However, in her mind and Integra&#39;s, her current problem needed to be 
solved. She couldn&#39;t go through her afterlife not being near Seras, but 
had no wish to harm her. And if Alucard had any answers to her 
predicament, she was willing to listen.

&#39;If I can find the door to the damn place, that is,&#39; she grumbled 
mentally to herself. Rally wandered the corridors of the dungeon-like 
basement, vainly trying to find a doorway. She knew that Alucard&#39;s 
quarters was in the vicinity - she could sense him - but she couldn&#39;t 
find the entrance.

After pausing to get her bearings, the dusky vampire studied her 
options. &#39;I guess I&#39;ve been going about this all wrong. Maybe Alucard&#39;s 
room DOESN&#39;T have a door. But if that&#39;s the case, how in the world am I 
going to get in?&#39; Rally cleared her mind, trying to figure out an 
answer. Then it came to her. &quot;Well, I guess if I want in, I shouldn&#39;t be 
trying to enter like a human.&quot; Thus clearing her mind, Rally faced the 
wall of her objective and walked towards - and through - it.

After she knew she was inside, what first startled Rally, once her 
vampiric eyes got used to the darkness, was the sheer size of the room, 
not to mention that it was totally devoid of any furnishings, not the 
mention the minimal decorations the walls had on them. The walls were 
made of stone, like the rest of the basement, and the only 
embellishments they had were large brass wall sconces where torches - or 
at least lighting fires - would be placed.

Then the sconces lit themselves, startling Rally. &quot;Hmmph... took you 
long enough,&quot; Alucard&#39;s voice sounded. Turning to the source of the 
voice, Rally saw the No-Life King seated on a tall throne at the far 
side of the room. &quot;Waiting around like this is a big bore,&quot; Alucard 
grumbled, &quot;so I suggest you get yourself seated so that we can get this 
over with.&quot; He indicated to a chair, which was placed near a table next 
to the throne.

&quot;Uh... yeah,&quot; Rally nodded, walking the distance between where she first 
entered the room. As she got to the chair, she noticed that there were 
two wine glasses on the table, as well as what appeared to be a bottle 
of wine.

Alucard wasted little time taking the bottle and pouring two servings 
into them. &quot;I know you have a lot on your mind, Rally Vincent,&quot; the 
nosferatu said, &quot;but it would help if you relaxed first. From what I 
learned from Sir Integra, you were involved in - shall we say, a little 
&#39;incident&#39; between yourself and your master.&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;re talking about that I attacked her, then I say you are right,&quot; 
Rally added, &quot;although my mind is still a blank about what had 
happened.&quot; She then noticed that Alucard had offered her one of the 
glasses. &quot;Are you sure...?&quot;

&quot;Oh quite sure,&quot; Alucard warmly said. &quot;Just because you are a vampire 
not, doesn&#39;t mean you cannot enjoy some of the finer things in life.&quot; 
Taking off his glasses, he added, &quot;Consider this as another lesson in 
your transition into becoming a vampire: our race can tolerate all sorts 
of liquids, be it water, wine, beers and ales - even hot chocolate if 
you like. We just have a little problem of consuming solid foods.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Rally smirked. &quot;You remember the first time I tried 
to eat a piece of bread?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes - and how you promptly vomited it up,&quot; the No-Life King 
remarked. &quot;If I recall, that was the first time you met Miss Hedgley, 
when she went to clean-up the mess.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rally answered, remembering how she needlessly frightened the 
girl. &quot;Well, enough about that - there&#39;s still that problem I have.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Alucard said. &quot;Shall we start from the beginning?&quot;

&quot;Guess that&#39;s the best place to start,&quot; Rally sighed, then took a sip of 
wine before beginning her tale.

A TOWER FLAT, WEST LONDON, EVENING...

For the first time in two months, Emma Wooley had her flat to herself. 
Without Jenn to talk to, the middle-aged woman busied herself by 
catching up with her cleaning. Occasionally, she would pause by a 
picture near her table, and would just sadly shake her head. That 
picture was of her son and his wife, with Jenn in-between them.

The night Jenn had came to live with her, Emma was still in shock from 
hearing of her parents&#39; deaths. Emma&#39;s son worked within a prominent 
company that worked closely with the British government. She clearly 
loved his wife, who worked as a kindergarten teacher. Jenn was beyond 
grief, almost inconsolable as she moved in. But it was a matter of time 
before the teen had gotten used to life without her parents.

&#39;At least Jenn plans to become a teacher, like her mother,&#39; Emma though 
to herself, remembering how the girl told her of her plans for the 
future. Wresting herself from her thoughts, Emma continued with her 
dusting... at least until she heard a scratching at her door.

&#39;Hmm... must be some cat that wants in,&#39; Emma thought. &#39;But pets are not 
allowed on these premises. Oh well, must be a stray that wandered in.&#39; 
Putting aside her cleaning rags, the woman walked over to the door. But 
when she opened it, Emma let out a loud scream.

What greeted her was the slavering jaws of fangs that went for her 
throat.
