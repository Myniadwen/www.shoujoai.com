<a href="../gunsmith/saddle-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>They stood just under a manhole, gazing up at it.

&quot;What are we waiting for?&quot; Cowboy whispered. The whisper disappeared 
into the darkness in a soft susurrus.

Rally didn&#146;t look at her. &quot;A signal.&quot;

&quot;What kind of signal?&quot; Cowboy asked.

A second later, a blast rocked the walls of the sewer, shaking both 
women. If they hadn&#146;t been holding onto to the ladder, they might well 
have fallen. The lid of the manhole popped out of its rim and lay half 
in, half out of the opening. Screams and shouts from above could be 
heard clearly. 

&quot;That kind of signal.&quot; Rally said with satisfaction. She glanced at 
the other woman. &quot;You okay to climb?&quot; Cowboy nodded. 

&quot;You bet.&quot;

Rally went first, drawing her gun as she reached the top. Poking her 
head out of the manhole, she was able to see the wreckage of what had 
been several parked cars. Men in nondescript suits ran this way and 
that. Several emergency vehicles were arriving and the scene was 
filled with chaos and smoke. Rally swung herself out of the manhole 
and helped Cowboy out. The two women ran low along a line of parked 
cars, and slipped around the corner. They stayed low, hiding among the 
trucks, when the noise of a car made them look up. 

A police cruiser pulled up too fast and stopped too abruptly. Roy 
stuck his head out the window and motioned them to hurry up. The door 
opened as they ran up and the car was in motion before the door had 
shut.

Rally and Cowboy both started to sigh with relief as the cruiser moved 
away from the scene of carnage. Turning towards the front of the car 
to thank Roy, Rally found herself staring into the barrel of a gun.

&quot;Sorry to have to do to this to you, Ms. Vincent,&quot; a smooth voice 
spoke from behind dark sunglasses, &quot;but your friend here has caused us 
quite a bit of trouble.&quot; Rally looked towards Roy and saw that his 
mouth was covered in clear tape, and that his hands were now cuffed to 
a ring in the dashboard.

Rally cursed to herself. &quot;You&#146;ve just kidnapped three innocent people 
- including a cop. Why don&#146;t you cut your losses now and let us all 
go?&quot;

Sunglasses smiled at her brightly. &quot;Four innocent people, Ms. Vincent. 
We couldn&#146;t have your little partner interfering again, could we?&quot; He 
slid his hand lasciviously into Rally&#146;s holster; brushing her breast 
both times he passed. &quot;And the others, too, please.&quot;

Rally, slowly lifted a leg and pulled the Grendel from its holster. 
She thought about May and sighed. &quot;OK, what is it you want from us?&quot; 
Sunglasses motioned once again at Rally and, reluctantly, she slipped 
the Duo from its spring.

Sunglasses laughed. &quot;Nothing at all. In fact, nothing ever again.&quot; 
Sunglasses nodded to the driver of the car and they pulled off the 
main road onto a side street.

A few minutes later, they pulled up at a deserted lot, surrounded by 
decrepit buildings. Rally and Cowboy were motioned out of the car and 
told to kneel, with their hands on their heads. They were thoroughly 
and nastily searched. When the driver had made sure that they had no 
other weapons, he pulled Rally&#146;s CZ75 and slipped back the safety.

&quot;Before you shoot me, Mr. Keaton,&quot; Rally said brightly, &quot;Can you 
answer one question?&quot;

Keaton pushed his sunglasses onto the bridge of his nose. &quot;What?&quot; he 
demanded.

&quot;Can you tell me why gasoline is leaking out of your car?&quot; Rally 
commented.

Keaton grinned. &quot;Very nice try, Ms. Vincent, but really&#133;.&quot;

The explosion was sudden, and violent. Rally, already hunched over, 
waited until the glass stopped falling and threw herself forward into 
a roll. Coming to her feet, she kicked the CZ75 out of the driver&#146;s 
hand. He grabbed at her, but he had been caught in the forehead with a 
piece of glass and the blood dripping into his eyes impeded his 
vision. 

Rally evaded his grab and kicked him hard in the groin. She moved in 
to strip him of Cowboy&#146;s gun, but a shot pushed her back. Looking up, 
she saw Keaton aiming his own gun at her forehead. Before he could 
even speak, another shot rang out and the gun seemed to jump from 
Keaton&#146;s hand. He screamed and grabbed his hand, cursing. Rally caught 
sight of Cowboy on the ground, holding the CZ75. Rally kicked the goon 
again, grabbed the SIG from his pocket and asked him, rather nicely, 
to kneel, with his hands on his head. 

Keaton stopped cursing abruptly, as Roy joined the group, rubbing his 
hand across his lips where the tape had been pulled off.

&quot;Arrest the bitch! She shot my thumb off!&quot; Keaton held the hand to his 
jacket, trying to stem the bleeding. Roy looked at the Assistant 
Director in amazement.

&quot;You&#146;re kidding, right?&quot;

Keaton cursed again, but Rally walked over and pushed the SIG into his 
temple, which shut him up pretty thoroughly.

&quot;You can come out now, May.&quot; Rally called and the young woman appeared 
from across the street.

&quot;Nice work!&quot; Rally congratulated her.

May smiled, pleased. &quot;Wasn&#146;t it? It&#146;s a new mix of nitro I&#146;ve been 
working on - small, but volatile. Did a great job on their car - I 
hope the company will reimburse them.&quot; 

Cowboy groaned as she pulled herself to her knees. Roy cuffed the 
driver, and spoke to him in low tones. They could hear sirens coming 
closer. Cowboy looked around.

&quot;Nothing personal, officer,&quot; she looked at Roy, who ignored Rally&#146;s 
snicker, &quot;but I probably should be going before your friends get 
here&#133;&quot; 

Roy glanced at her, Rally, and May, and nodded. &quot;Get the hell out of 
here before I change my mind.&quot; Locking eyes with Cowboy he said, 
&quot;Don&#146;t leave town Ms. Simms - we&#146;ll need to talk.&quot;

Cowboy nodded and the three women moved off as quickly as she could 
limp; in a few moments, they had disappeared. When the police cruisers 
arrived, Roy explained how the thug had attacked the Assistant 
Director and himself. Looking pointedly at Keaton, he asked the AD for 
his confirmation. Scowling, Keaton gave it.
