<a href="../gunsmith/saddle-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Time passes quickly when you&#146;re busy, they say, but Rally also noticed 
that time passed quickly when you&#146;re avoiding being busy.

Business was quiet; bounty hunting was out of the question, since she 
was suspended. It was too hot to do much and the store was as clean as 
she and a bottle of glass cleaner could make it. She sighed heavily 
and leaned her chin on her hands. The door signal chimed and Rally 
looked up in surprise as a tall woman walked into the store.

&quot;Cowboy!&quot; Rally came around the front of the counter, smiling.

&quot;Hey darlin&#146;. I thought it was time to see your spread.&quot; She looked 
around and nodded. &quot;Pretty spiffy.&quot; Whistling, she walked over to a 
case and nodded. &quot;Nice. You probably sell a lot of those.&quot;

&quot;The AR-15s? Yeah - they&#146;re pretty popular. Easily customizable, 
people seem to like &#145;em.&quot; Rally found herself turning away when their 
eyes met.

&quot;So,&quot; Rally stepped back to the counter, pretending not to notice the 
warmth in her cheeks, &quot;what brings you to this part of town?&quot;

&quot;Cowboy shrugged. &quot;Nothin&#146; really. I&#146;m &quot;in between jobs&quot; as they say, 
and had nothing better to do.&quot;

&quot;In between jobs?&quot; Rally asked. &quot;What is it you do?&quot;

&quot;Oh, heh,&quot; Cowboy looked a little sheepish, &quot;delivery, mostly. Nothing 
special.&quot;

The conversation lapsed in to silence.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Rally said suddenly, &quot;can I get you some coffee or something? 
Although it&#146;s kind of hot for coffee&#133;&quot; she said a little wistfully.

&quot;Actually,&quot; Cowboy came up to the counter and leaned on it, her face 
close to Rally&#146;s, &quot;I was hopin&#146; you&#146;d join me for a beer.&quot; She 
scrunched her face up in the same smile Rally knew from the photo in 
the file. &quot;You *are* legal, right?&quot;

Rally grinned. &quot;Twenty-two.&quot;

Cowboy grinned back. &quot;Sure. And my Daddy was Macarthur. Well, if you 
know a place that&#146;ll serve you, that&#146;ll do.&quot;

***

Cowboy gave an envious whistle when she saw the Cobra. Rally preened.

&quot;Helloooo kitty!&quot; Cowboy said, as she stroked the hood with a 
fingertip. &quot;This is one hell of a piece of work!&quot;

&quot;Custom job,&quot; Rally said unnecessarily. Cowboy nodded absent-mindedly. 
&quot;Get in. It&#146;s my turn to drive.&quot; Rally almost laughed out loud with 
pleasure.

***

Two beers. Not much, Rally thought. I&#146;ll have two beers and ask her 
what was up with that chase and that&#146;ll be that.

Three beers later, Rally had forgotten and remembered her plan 
something like thirty times. The two women had just arm-wrestled and 
were now hiccupping with laughter, although neither of them could have 
told anyone why. Cowboy waved the bartender over and asked for another 
round. He frowned a bit, but brought two more frosted glasses. It 
wasn&#146;t as if he hadn&#146;t seen in a thousand times already&#133;

&quot;Say, Cowboy,&quot; Rally had to remember to remember what she was going to 
say, &quot;what the hell was that chase about anyway?&quot;

&quot;Chase?&quot; Cowboy was puzzled. &quot;Oh that. Sheesh, I never apologized for 
that, did I?&quot; Rall, ole buddy, I guess you figured out that they were 
gunnin&#146; for me by now, haven&#146;t ya?&quot;

Rally nodded exaggeratedly, so Cowboy knew what she meant.

Cowboy nodded. Then nodded again. &quot;What was I sayin&#146;?&quot;

Rally barked with laughter. &quot;You were apologizing, because you almost 
got me killed on the bike.&quot;

&quot;Ain&#146;t she a sweet thing?&quot; Cowboy&#146;s attention seemed to have wandered 
again. &quot;A finer piece of metal I&#146;ve never had.&quot; The tall woman nodded 
a few times for emphasis. Grinning at Rally she asked, &quot;So, what&#146;d you 
think of her? You liked that little ride, right?&quot;

Rally&#146;s head bobbed up and down like a Chihuahua toy in the back of a 
car. &quot;Hell yeah. Now that&#146;s speed!&quot; They toasted to speed and drank.

Rally frowned&#133;there was something she wanted to know.

&#145;Right. Oh, right.&quot; Cowboy said with surprise. &quot;Right, like I said - 
I&#146;m sorry. It was all a misunderstanding. The city planners want to 
tear down my apartment building and I just got moved in and all. I 
went down there and gave them a piece of my mind. It was all a 
misunderstandin&#146;, ya see?&quot;

Rally nodded. That was it. A misunderstanding. &quot;Sure, sure - no sweat. 
But hey, thanks for the ride!&quot; They grinned at each other.

Outside the bar, Cowboy said she&#146;d walk back to her place. &quot;I got a 
snoot full - the air&#146;ll do me good.&quot;

Rally opened the Cobra door. As she moved to get in the car, she was 
pulled back with a jerk and awkwardly embraced by a gushing Cowboy. 
Off balance, Rally had to grab onto the woman to stay upright. She 
looked up to find Cowboy&#146;s blue eyes crinkled up in a smile.

&quot;Hey, Rally, you&#146;re all right.&quot; Cowboy let Rally go so suddenly that 
she stumbled back and fell into the driver&#146;s seat. She watched the 
tall woman walk off somewhat unsteadily, until she couldn&#146;t see her 
anymore.

***

Later that night, Rally lay in bed with an icepack on her head, 
moaning softly to herself. &quot;Damn you, Cowboy,&quot; she said to the room at 
large.

May entered with a tray. &quot;Here you go, Rally. Some of my mama&#146;s 
homemade hangover recipe!&quot; May was being loud and cheerful on purpose, 
Rally assumed.

May spooned some nasty herbal concoction into Rally&#146;s mouth and 
watched her solemnly as she choked on it.

Spluttering, Rally said, &quot;Your mother never made that!&quot;

May smiled brightly. &quot;Not my mother, silly - the Mama at the Purple 
Pussy. This is her recipe.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Rally lay back, the pounding in her head was letting up a 
little.

&quot;What were you thinking Rally? You never drink this much.&quot; May looked 
down at her friend.

&quot;I didn&#146;t drink this much,&quot; Rally said petulantly. &quot;Cowboy and I were 
just having a beer or two.&quot;

&quot;Cowboy, huh?&quot; May stood and picked up the tray. &quot;Rally - don&#146;t you 
think it&#146;s kind of weird - her turning up here and all?&quot;

Rally cracked an eye open. &quot;Nah. I invited her to drop by. What are 
you worried about?&quot;

May shook her head. &quot;I&#146;m not sure.&quot; She walked over to the door. &quot;You 
like her Rally, don&#146;t you?&quot; May&#146;s voice was teasing.

&quot;Sure I do. She&#146;s fun and she&#146;s a good shot - and has a nice bike&#133;&quot; 
Rally closed her eyes again, as sleep crept up on her.

&quot;That&#146;s not what I mean.&quot; May said, and closed the door behind her.

***

Rally was riding again - this time the wind hit her full in the face. 
The speed must have been incredible, because she felt like she was 
flying. Then she opened her eyes and saw the ground rushing up at her 
headlong. She closed her eyes again and screamed&#133;and woke up.

Sitting up, Rally breathed deeply until her heart stopped racing, then 
sat there in the darkness for a long time. Eventually she felt ready 
to try to sleep again. She thought about her last meeting with Cowboy, 
about how they parted. This time, when Rally looked up, Cowboy stopped 
talking and leaned down a little. Rally&#146;s hands tightened on Cowboy&#146;s 
arms as they kissed.

Rally&#146;s eyes popped open. The light of morning turned the room the 
same shade of grey she felt. Stumbling out of bed, Rally threw herself 
into the shower. The hot water felt good, like fingers that stroked 
her stiff muscles. Leaning against the wall, she let the fingers 
soothe her sore body. When she realized that the fingers belonged to a 
tall brunette, Rally turned off the hot water and braved the blast of 
cold for a solid minute. Shivering and miserable, she toweled herself 
off and went downstairs for breakfast.
