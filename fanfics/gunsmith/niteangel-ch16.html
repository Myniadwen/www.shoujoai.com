<h1>Night Angels (part 16 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gunsmith/index.html">Gunsmith Cats</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ecoldiron.html">Elwin Blain Coldiron</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gunsmith/niteangel-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>For the most part, the walk to the Yellow Flag Bar proved to be the 
perfect tonic for Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent. When she left the hotel, she 
was totally incensed at the fact that her friend, Becky &#39;the Nose&#39; 
Farrah, had been frightened out of her wits by the Lagoon Company&#39;s 
Revy. In the state of mind she was at the time she, along with Seras 
Victoria and Moria Hedgley, left for the bar, she could&#39;ve caused 
wholesale bloodshed if she wanted to!

Now, as the trio approached the bar, the dusky vampire had calmed down 
conversably, but was still fuming. &quot;Are you sure you can behave yourself 
while we&#39;re there?&quot; Seras asked, still concerned by the look of the face 
of her servant. &quot;When we left the hotel, you looked like you could&#39;ve 
taken on the whole of Iscariot by yourself!&quot;

&quot;Thanks for your concern, Master,&quot; Rally said, stopping for a time. 
&quot;Yeah, I was steamed and I&#39;m still steamed! The way Becky was trembling, 
I didn&#39;t even care who got in my way - just so long as they were dead 
afterwards!&quot;

&quot;Well thank goodness we persuaded you to walk the way to that bar rather 
than take a motor car in,&quot; added Moria.

&quot;Yeah. Look Moria, you don&#39;t have to come with us, you know,&quot; Rally 
said, a tone of concern on her voice. &quot;If Bill is right about the place, 
it could get a little rough.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate the concern but no. Sir Integra placed me in charge of you 
two&#39;s well-being and I intend to fulfill that trust.&quot; She patted the 
shoulder holster she wore, a Glock 22 in it, along with Rally and Seras, 
the Draculina toting her Sig Sauer P-210 from her police days. &quot;Besides, 
I am well-capable of taking care of myself, thank you.&quot; Moria then 
looked at Rally&#39;s face and added, &quot;By the way, I believe before we 
enter, you had best do something about those eyes of yours.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Rally asked.

&quot;The color... they changed back when you gotten mad about what happened 
to Becky,&quot; the maid said.

Then Rally got the point. &quot;Oh. Thanks for telling me, Moria.&quot; She then 
closed her eyes for two seconds, then opened them again, the orange-red 
hue of the eyes transformed to blue.

&quot;Much better,&quot; Seras said. &quot;Now I suggest we get ourselves inside and 
see what we can find out. And no direct questions, I might say. Don&#39;t 
want to be placed in a difficult situation, after all.&quot;

&quot;Gotcha, Master,&quot; Rally said, then all three girls resumed their course 
towards the bar.

However, off to the side in a clump of bushes, Natasha Radinov observed 
as the three made their way inside. &#39;So, it seems that Rally Vincent is 
interested in this bar, too,&#39; she thought to herself. &#39;I would like to 
come inside too. However, that bartender Bao is probably still mad at me 
for shooting up the bar a long time ago. But I like to see him try to 
demand payment for what happened.&#39;

The interior of the bar was just as the three expected: dark and smoky, 
and the clientele seemed to be of every disreputable type found on the 
island. There were thieves and criminals of every type exchanging 
stories over rounds of beer. At several tables, prostitutes were 
listening in to the stories, hoping to ply their trade to the regulars. 
And one thing was evident: firearms of every type were openly displayed, 
either worn on their persons, or lying on the table.

There was one thing, though, that the vampires found a relief. &quot;Good 
thing there are no mirrors in this place, otherwise we might have to 
adapt for that,&quot; Rally whispered to Seras.

&quot;If Agent Collins is correct, I suppose that mirrors would be an 
expensive luxury that the owner wouldn&#39;t be able to afford. And with all 
this firepower is see, I wouldn&#39;t blame him,&quot; Seras added.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you girls find us a table to sit while I go to the bartender 
and order drinks,&quot; Moria added. &quot;You two wouldn&#39;t mind beer, would you?&quot;

&quot;That would be perfect. If you can, see if you can get me a bitter,&quot; the 
Draculina said.

&quot;Any beer is fine with me,&quot; Rally shrugged. Smiling, Moria made her way 
to the bar.

Now Bao, the Yellow Flag&#39;s owner and principal bartender, had served 
many a woman in his career since leaving Vietnam, but this newcomer 
seemed a little off for him. &quot;Look, Miss,&quot; he began, &quot;whatever it is, I 
don&#39;t sell cocktails here! You want some, go find a hotel.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need to be rude,&quot; huffed Moria. &quot;I just wanted to order a 
round of beers for my friends over there.&quot; She pointed over to Rally and 
Seras seated at the tables.

Bao studied the seated girls, then appraised Moria. &quot;Humph, well I guess 
you&#39;re safe, even though you girls don&#39;t look like the fighting type.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Moria said. &quot;Now about the orders...&quot;

&quot;Before you do, I&#39;ll have to tell you any beers we sell aren&#39;t those 
stuffy Brit types that are served warm,&quot; Bao said.

The maid just stared at the bartender. &quot;You... don&#39;t have any bitter? My 
friend absolutly loves bitter!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, what we got is REAL beer here,&quot; griped Bao, &quot;now how about those 
orders?&quot;

Moria just rolled her eyes.

Now outside at this time, a late 1960&#39;s orange Plymouth Challenger coupe 
drove up near the entrance. As soon as it stopped and the engine died, 
the occupants of the vehicle - Dutch, Benny, Revy and Rock, exited. 
&quot;Look Dutch,&quot; the former salaryman began, &quot;I agree we&#39;ve been under a 
lot of stress lately about this Hellsing Organization that may be after 
us... and frankly I wouldn&#39;t mind going out for a bit, but I&#39;m not 
really sure that this is the right option.&quot;

&quot;Hey, who cares if it is a right option?&quot; Dutch countered. &quot;Rock, 
sometimes you just don&#39;t give a fuck about what problems come your way, 
so the best thing is to relax and put things in their proper 
perspectives.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got that right, Dutch,&quot; Benny added, again looking at the 
acrylic-encased FREAK chip before again pocketing it again. &quot;I&#39;ve got so 
many theories about how this baby&#39;s used, I&#39;m getting brain cramps just 
thinking about the brain cramps.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, so I&#39;d stop bitching if I were you, Rock,&quot; Revy agreed. &quot;Right 
now I&#39;m looking forward to beating you again when we go shot-for shot!&quot;

&quot;If I remember correctly, Revy,&quot; Rock countered, &quot;it was I who won last 
time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Dutch added, &quot;and you were spending all day the next day praying 
to the porcelain goddess.&quot;

&quot;Oh give me a break, Dutch,&quot; Revy snarled.

&quot;People, let&#39;s not start arguing again,&quot; Benny said, &quot;Let&#39;s just go 
party.&quot;

From her vantage point in the bushes, Radinov took in the sight. &quot;So it 
is THEY who have the chip,&quot; she chuckled. &quot;Well, all I have to do is 
wait until they exit the bar... and then it will be mine!&quot;

XXX

Moria had returned to the table where Rally and Seras sat, carrying 
three iced mugs and three amber bottles. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Seras, but I&#39;m 
afraid that surly bartender over there didn&#39;t have any bitter on hand - 
just lager, I&#39;m afraid. But at least I found a Filipino brand that&#39;s of 
good quality. I hope this helps.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Moria,&quot; the Draculina sighed. &quot;And I was so hoping to have some 
bitter.&quot;

&quot;Master, life - or the afterlife for that matter, isn&#39;t Burger King. 
Nobody can have it their way,&quot; Rally chuckled after she poured her beer. 
But then her attention was grabbed by the four individuals entering the 
bar. &quot;She here!&quot; she snarled under her breath, her eyes returning to 
their orange-red color.

&quot;Rally, your eyes!&quot; Moria whispered.

&quot;Okay,&quot; the dusky vampire whispered, her eyes returning to blue. &quot;Sorry 
about that, but seeing that Revy bitch come in just got me all amped.&quot;

&quot;Well remember to control your temper,&quot; Seras added. &quot;Master told us our 
mood often brings about these changes.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; Rally then noticed that the Lagoon Company wandered up to the 
bar, where Revy proceeded to buy several bottles of rum for her and 
Rock&#39;s drinking contest. &quot;Looks like they&#39;re only here for a good time. 
I think as soon as they leave, we&#39;ll follow them, but from a distance at 
least.&quot;

&quot;Good choice,&quot; Seras added. &quot;With all these criminals in this bar, it 
would be a bit of a complication if we confronted them here and now.&quot;

The women then continued to drink and make their plans for this evening. 
However, two tables behind them, a trio of rather rough men were 
whooping it up, trading stories between shots of whiskey. But one of 
them, a muscular bald man, his right thumb missing, happened to glance 
over at the girls. &quot;Holy fuck,&quot; he said, his sight mostly on Rally, &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe I&#39;m seeing this!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s up, Bert?&quot; one of his drinking companions said. &quot;You look like 
you saw someone.&quot;

&quot;That I did, Jock,&quot; Bert replied, &quot;and I couldn&#39;t be happier! Wait right 
here.&quot;

&quot;Be careful you don&#39;t get too rough, Bert,&quot; Jock said. &quot;Bao will throw 
us out if you start shooting.&quot;

Bert then got up from his chair, a gun in his left hand and sauntered 
behind Rally. &quot;Hey, how about a word?&quot;

Without turning around, Rally grumbled, &quot;Sorry, this is a private 
party.&quot; Pointing to a group of prostitutes, she added, &quot;You want action, 
go talk to those business girls there.&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T GET SMART WITH ME!!&quot; Bert bellowed, catching the attention of 
everyone - including the Lagoon Company - in the bar. &quot;I&#39;M TALKING TO 
YOU, RALLY VINCENT!!&quot;

&quot;ACK!!&quot; Now Rally recognized the voice. Slowly turning around, she got a 
good look at the fellow behind her. &quot;Bert Kampas? What the fuck are you 
doing here? I thought you were doing time in Joliet!&quot;

&quot;I was going to ask you the same question,&quot; Bert said, cocking the 
hammer on his gun. &quot;As for yours, I broke-out last week and decided to 
head out here. So if you think you&#39;re going to drag my ass all the way 
back to Chicago, you&#39;ve got another think coming!&quot; He indicated to the 
patrons of the bar, &quot;I bet everyone in this bar has a very low opinion 
to bounty hunters like you, so I wouldn&#39;t think about trying anything 
while I kill you!&quot; He held up his thumbless right hand, &quot;I&#39;m going to 
pay you back for shooting off my thumb here! Do you know what a 
pain-in-the-fucking-ass it is to learn to shoot with your left hand?&quot;

Now while Bert was ranting, Revy happened to get a good look at Rally, 
having never seen her before. With a huge toothy grin on her face, she 
made her way to the table, one of her guns in her hand.

&quot;Look Bert, you&#39;re the one who shouldn&#39;t try anything!&quot; Rally shot back. 
&quot;We may be girls, but we know how to defend ourselves.&quot; She then glanced 
over Bert&#39;s shoulder and saw Revy walking behind him, still grinning. 
&#39;Oh fuck... they&#39;ve saw us!&#39; she thought. &#39;There goes our plan to follow 
them!&#39;

Once she was settled behind the thug, Revy tapped his shoulder. &quot;Hey,&quot; 
she said in a low voice, &quot;move aside. I&#39;ve got business with this girl.&quot;

&quot;WHY DON&#39;T YOU SHOVE THE FUCK OFF!!&quot; Bert yelled, turning to face Revy, 
being a newcomer not recognizing her, &quot;MY BUSINESS COMES FIRST AND IF 
YOU THINK...&quot;

BANG!!

The next thing anyone knew, Bert was lying on the floor, a shot placed 
in his forehead. Moria, Seras and Rally stood shocked at the events, 
with the vampires fighting their thirsts at the scent of freshly-spilled 
blood.

&quot;What a fucking loser,&quot; Revy grumbled, kicking Bert&#39;s body aside. &quot;Well, 
now that this is over with, it&#39;s time we got down to business.&quot; Eying 
Rally square in the eye, she then said, &quot;So you are Rally Vincent from 
Chicago? Must admit, I was expecting someone a little tougher than what 
you look like - but then again, looks aren&#39;t everything.&quot;

Feeling her fangs retracting, Rally returned the glare. &quot;That&#39;s right. 
And you must be one of the thieves who stole property of the Hellsing 
Organization, who I work for now.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get pissy, bitch,&quot; Revy snapped, her hand tapping the chromed 
Beretta. &quot;That&#39;s a matter for later! Right now you&#39;ve got something I 
want, and I would like to have it.&quot; She glanced over at Rally&#39;s holster. 
&quot;Nice gun, by the way - CZ-75 First Edition, am I right?&quot;

Rally smiled, but still glared at the girl. &quot;You want my gun. Sorry, but 
it&#39;s not for sale. I&#39;m pretty attached to it as it is.&quot;

Revy let out a small laugh. &quot;In this world, EVERYTHING has a price. I 
want that gun, and you&#39;re going to give it to me.&quot;

&quot;And I say the only way you&#39;re getting it that you pry my dead fingers 
away from it!&quot; Rally shot back.&quot;

During this exchange, Dutch studied the two women, his thoughts on the 
Smith &amp; Wesson in his holster. &quot;Rock, Benny, on my signal, you two dive 
behind the bar,&quot; he said, remembering the armored backplate Bao put 
installed in case of gunfights.

&quot;What about you, Dutch?&quot; Rock hissed, his eyes moving between the bar 
and the two women.

&quot;Hopefully I won&#39;t get involved,&quot; Dutch said, &quot;but from the way things 
are going, that&#39;s not going to happen!&quot;

Revy grinned at Rally&#39;s retort. &quot;Somehow, that&#39;s how I expected it to 
be.&quot; She then aimed her gun at Rally, who shot out of her chair and 
reached for her holster. &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll have things your way, but don&#39;t 
expect to live through...&quot;

&quot;DAMMIT ALL TO HELL REVY, YOU&#39;RE NOT GOING TO DO THIS TO ME AGAIN!!&quot; Bao 
shouted, catching the two&#39;s attention. &quot;IF YOU&#39;RE GOING TO SHOOT-UP MY 
BAR AGAIN, THEN YOU AND DUTCH ARE GOING TO PAY ME DOUBLE TO GET IT FIXED 
UP AND RESTOCKED AGAIN!! AND THE SAME GOES FOR YOUR FRIEND THERE!!&quot;

Both Rally and Revy looked at the irate bartender, the same odd look on 
both their faces. Then looking at each other, their expressions 
unchanged, Revy offered in a deadpan voice, &quot;I&#39;ve got a better idea. Why 
don&#39;t we take this outside?&quot;

&quot;Find by me,&quot; Rally replied in the same voice. &quot;You go out first; I 
don&#39;t fancy getting shot in the back.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Revy muttered as she made her way to the door, with Rally 
following.

&#39;Rally... you&#39;re not thinking of killing her, are you?&#39; Seras asked 
telepathically.

&#39;After she scared Becky out of her wits, she would deserve it!&#39; replied 
Rally, but smiled and added, &#39;However, I think it might be a bit better 
if I can scare the piss out of her and at the same time let her know how 
Becky felt.&#39;

&quot;Oh I see,&quot; Seras said aloud as she and Moria, along with the rest of 
the Lagoon Company, made their way out. And as they left, Bao let out a 
sigh of relief, then directed several of the clientele to remove Bert&#39;s 
dead body and clean-up the blood.

Several of the bar&#39;s patrons then made their way to the door, hoping for 
a show. However, Dutch stopped by the door and called out, &quot;Now all you 
guys know better than to follow us out. This is personal business 
between those two, not a show for your entertainment. So why don&#39;t you 
get back to your drinks and we&#39;ll let you know how it turned out.&quot; There 
was a chorus of disappointed groans, but everyone eventually returned to 
their tables.

As soon as they were in the parking lot, Rally and Revy faced each 
other. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get one thing clear,&quot; the brown-haired woman 
said, &quot;I want that gun of yours and I want it now!&quot;

&quot;And I say you have to kill me first if you want to get it!&quot; countered 
Rally. &quot;So what are you going to do about it.&quot;

Revy thought for a minute. &quot;Okay, how about this?&quot; she said. &quot;We do fast 
draw. The winner gets whatever they want. The loser... dies. Got it?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got two guns,&quot; Rally said, catching sight of Revy&#39;s twin 
holsters. &quot;How am I going to know you&#39;re not going to use them instead 
of one.&quot;

Smirking, Revy secured the strap on the Beretta in her right holster. 
&quot;Satisfied?&quot;

&quot;Much.&quot; Rally then glanced over to Seras, who along with the rest of the 
Lagoon Company, was off to the side with Moria. &#39;Master, whatever you 
do, neither you nor Moria should interfere. I&#39;ve got a plan.&#39;

&#39;I trust you, Rally,&#39; Seras answered back, nodding.

For the better part of a minute, the two women stood at a distance of 
twenty feet in front of each other, hands to their sides and staring 
each other in the eye. Then Rally&#39;s right hand went for her holster, 
triggering Revy to do the same.

BANG!!

BANG!!

Rally was knocked backwards from the impact of the bullet on her head, 
flying three feet before landing on her back, gun still in hand. Revy 
just snorted her disgust as she reholstered her Berretta. &quot;Talk about 
disappointing,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I thought she would&#39;ve been a better shot 
than that! Oh well, as long as I&#39;ve won, I might as well get my prize.&quot; 
She then walked over to Rally&#39;s body and went to take her gun.

Still looking with concern, Moria&#39;s attention was grabbed when Seras 
tapped her shoulder. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about Rally,&quot; she whispered. &quot;She 
deliberately missed hitting Revy, not to mention luring her in.&quot;

&quot;Luring her in for what?&quot; the maid whispered.

Seras smiled. &quot;Oh you&#39;ll see,&quot; was all she said. Moria just nodded.

Meanwhile, the job of removing Rally&#39;s gun from her hands was proving to 
be tougher than Revy thought. &quot;Shit a god-damned brick, why the fuck is 
she still gripping that gun?&quot; She said to herself. Then she paused. 
&quot;Wait a fucking minute - she&#39;s been dead for only a few seconds and yet 
she&#39;s ice-cold! She should at least be still warm from...&quot;

WHACK!!

Revy then found herself flying backward, having been struck by Rally&#39;s 
gun hand. &quot;OW!!&quot; she growled, rubbing her jaw as the rest of the Lagoon 
Company came to her side. &quot;WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED!!&quot;

&quot;I saw it but I still don&#39;t believe it!&quot; Benny added. &quot;Her arm just 
shot-up and got Revy in the jaw!&quot;

&quot;That... that&#39;s impossible!&quot; Rock gasped. &quot;Could&#39;ve it been some reflex 
action on her part?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not certain it is!&quot; Dutch observed. &quot;Granted, I&#39;ve seen a lot of 
odd shit in my day but this is a first for me!&quot;

Then the four&#39;s attention was attracted by a cold, mocking laughter - in 
Rally&#39;s direction. Then their jaws dropped as Rally sat up from the 
ground, her eyes closed but the bullet that was in her head found itself 
being forced out and the wound healing. &quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you,&quot; she said, 
the tone of her voice almost matching Alucard&#39;s most threatening manner, 
&quot;the only way you&#39;re getting my gun is by prying my cold... dead... 
fingers from it!&quot; Rally then opened her eyes - revealing an orange-red 
glow to them.

&quot;No way... no fucking way!&quot; Revy gasped as a new sensation - fear - 
began to grip her.

&quot;Dutch - what could this mean?&quot; Rock added, breaking out in a cold 
sweat.

&quot;Holy sweet Jesus,&quot; the African American breathed, also sweating. &quot;You 
remember those twins, Hansel and Gretel?&quot; The rest of the Lagoon Company 
nodded. &quot;They were called the Vampire Twins, but compared to her, they 
were amateurs! People - I think we&#39;re looking at the genuine article 
here!&quot;

&quot;That - that girl&#39;s a vampire!?&quot; gasped Benny. &quot;But they&#39;re not supposed 
to exist?&quot;

&quot;Try telling her that!&quot; Dutch said as Rally got back on her feet. &quot;I 
suggest we get ourselves the hell out of here!&quot;

Not questioning their leader&#39;s orders, the four began to make for their 
car - only to be blocked by Seras, who in a split-second dashed 
in-between the Lagoon Company and their escape. &quot;You&#39;re not going 
anywhere!&quot; the Draculina said, her eyes also glowing.


&quot;OH SHIT!! THERE&#39;S TWO OF THEM!!&quot; Rock shouted, almost to the point of 
panic.

Finally regaining her wits, Revy scanned the area looking for an 
advantage - and found it in the form of a solitary Moria, apart from her 
friends. Moving quickly, she shot to the side, catching the lone woman 
off-guard as she grabbed her.

&quot;OH MY GOD... MORIA!!&quot; Rally tried to return to the maid&#39;s side, only to 
be stopped when Revy jammed a gun against Moria&#39;s temple.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t make a move if I were you, bloodsucker,&quot; Revy spat, holding 
Moria at bay. &quot;Oh yeah, you may be a fucking vampire, but when I&#39;ve got 
your little friend here, you can&#39;t do anything!&quot; Relaxing her guard, she 
further added, &quot;Now, we&#39;re going to continue our little business deal 
here and... BOOOOF!!&quot; Quickly, Moria jammed her right elbow into Revy&#39;s 
solar plexus, then grabbing her right arm flipped the Chinese girl over 
her shoulder, disarming her at the same time.

On her back, Revy managed to get the wind back into her, only to see a 
clearly angry Moria standing over her, cracking her knuckles. &quot;Rally, 
Seras,&quot; she said, &quot;if you don&#39;t mind, I would like an opportunity to 
teach this malcontent a lesson she&#39;ll never forget!&quot;

Still in a little shock over Moria&#39;s escape, Rally could only say, 
&quot;Uh... yeah, go ahead.&quot; She then looked over at the Lagoon Company and 
added, &quot;Me and Master will keep the others here.&quot;

Revy just looked angrily at Moria. &quot;So you&#39;re going to teach me a 
fucking lesson, you little whore? Well go ahead and try, because...&quot; She 
never finished, on account of the spinning back-kick Moria delivered to 
her jaw, sending her flying.

&quot;Your first lesson,&quot; Moria snarled, &quot;is that I&#39;m going to curb that 
vulgar mouth of yours!&quot; She then took up a defensive stance, bracing for 
the next attack.

Spitting the blood from her mouth, Revy screamed as she charged the 
brunette, but try as she might, she was having trouble connecting, the 
way Moria was dodging the blows. Revy then made a straight punch at her 
opponent&#39;s head, but Moria sided it away, at the same time grabbing it, 
twisting her wrist, and connecting with her right elbow, then kneeing 
her gut. As the Chinese girl bent down, she got the left elbow slammed 
savagely into the back of her neck.

Slow to get up, Revy shook her head, trying to get the cobwebs out of 
it. &quot;Shit,&quot; she muttered, &quot;it&#39;s like fighting that damned Roberta 
again!&quot; Looking up at the brunette, she then asked, &quot;I&#39;ve got something 
to ask... you wouldn&#39;t happen to be a maid, would you?&quot;

&quot;As a matter of fact... yes,&quot; answered Moria, although she did wonder 
about the question.

But the Lagoon Company didn&#39;t... instead they stood there slack-jawed at 
the answer. &quot;I don&#39;t believe this!&quot; Rock gasped.

&quot;You&#39;re telling me!&quot; Dutch added.

&quot;We must be cursed, guys!&quot; Benny put in. &quot;We&#39;re having Nazis, child hit 
persons, vampires and bad-ass maids coming out of the woodwork!&quot;

But Revy didn&#39;t find any amusement at the answer. &quot;Okay so you&#39;re a 
fucking maid,&quot; she snarled, &quot;whoopee-fucking doo! That&#39;s not going to 
save you from getting killed!!&quot; She then caught Moria off-guard by 
throwing a handful of dirt she managed to grab into her face. While 
struggling to clear her eyes, the brunette is pummeled in the face by 
Revy, cutting her.

But that didn&#39;t last. &quot;YOU... CHEATING BLACKGUARD!!&quot; Moria yelled, 
finding Revy&#39;s crotch with her foot. Doubling over from the pain, Revy 
found herself the recipient of a number of punches, kicks, and chops 
from a thoroughly-pissed maid. It was capped-off with a mighty 
head-butt, followed by a powerful roundhouse kick in the stomach.

Gasping for breath, Revy could only glare at Moria, who was also panting 
heavily. &quot;OKAY, THAT FUCKING SETTLES IT!!&quot; she yelled, drawing her other 
gun, &quot;I&#39;M GOING TO END THIS RIGHT...&quot;

BANG!!

&quot;OWWWW!!&quot; Revy was clutching her left hand after her gun was shot from 
it. &quot;NOW WHO THE FUCK...&quot;

&quot;That is quite enough, thank you.&quot; Everyone turned to the source of this 
new voice - Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing - whose Walther PPK 
was still smoking from disarming Revy. Also appearing was Deepak 
Vincent, also armed with his Army-issue Beretta and drawing down at the 
Lagoon Company. William Collins was there, as well as Becky, who seemed 
quite calm considering her earlier scare. &quot;Miss Hedgley, are you well?&quot; 
she asked.

&quot;Quite well... Sir Integra,&quot; Moria panted.

&quot;Frankly, I&#39;m quite surprised she was able to take her,&quot; Rally added.

Looking over the situation, Dutch was quietly reaching over to his gun - 
only to stop when he heard a bolt being pulled back from behind him. &quot;I 
wouldn&#39;t be too hasty, mon frere.&quot; Turning around, he saw Pip Bernadotte 
standing behind him, armed with a machine pistol. &quot;Allo there, Dutch. 
Nice seeing you again.&quot;

&quot;I wish the circumstances allowed me to return the compliment, Pip,&quot; 
Dutch added. &quot;You&#39;ve certainly changed. The last time I saw you, you had 
TWO eyes!&quot;

&quot;Well what can I say?&quot; Pip shrugged. &quot;Eet&#39;s ze nature of ze business 
after all.&quot;

&quot;Enough with the pleasantries,&quot; Sir Integra said, interrupting. &quot;There 
is still the business at hand - namely the return of property of the 
Hellsing Organization!&quot;

&quot;If you think we&#39;re going to fucking hand over that chip without getting 
anything for our trouble,&quot; Revy snarled, eyeing Sir Integra, &quot;then 
you&#39;re out of your tree, bitch... because I&#39;m going to...&quot; She then 
found herself back on the ground, being restrained by Moria. &quot;YOU WHORE, 
LET ME GO!!&quot;

All she got was a hard slap on the head by Moria. &quot;You watch your 
language around Sir Integra!&quot; she snapped. &quot;You should be grateful I do 
not break your miserable neck for this... or at the worst have you fed 
to Rally!&quot;

&quot;I am grateful you have such restraint, Miss Hedgley,&quot; Sir Integra wryly 
said, then she turned to Seras and added, &quot;By the way, it looks like you 
have taught her a few police take-down maneuvers.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you, Sir Integra,&quot; Seras bubbled.

Making her way to Becky, Rally said to her, &quot;I&#39;m surprised you had the 
courage to come here, considering what she did to you.&quot;

The information expert just shrugged. &quot;Can&#39;t run away from your fears 
all the time, Rally,&quot; she said. &quot;By the way, that little hypno trick you 
did with me - worked like a charm!&quot;

&quot;Well now that we have everything taken care of,&quot; Sir Integra began, 
glaring at Dutch, &quot;it is time I recovered my property! The chip - now!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not getting it, bitch - not without payment!&quot; Revy growled, only 
to get her neck painfully craned back by Moria.

&quot;Benny - hand her back the chip,&quot; Dutch sighed.

&quot;NO DUTCH, YOU CAN&#39;T DO IT!!&quot; Revy yelled.

&quot;REVY, JUST FOR ONCE LET A LITTLE COMMON SENSE RULE HERE!!&quot; countered 
Dutch, catching her off guard. &quot;IT&#39;S YOUR OWN FAULT WE&#39;RE IN THE MESS 
WE&#39;RE IN!! IT WAS YOUR GREEDY IDEA TO STEAL THAT CHIP, NOT MINE!!&quot; He 
then calmed himself down, &quot;Benny-boy, you know what to do.&quot;

&quot;Alright Dutch.&quot; Benny then produced the chip and proceeded to walk 
towards Sir Integra.

Revy, still restrained by Moria, glared poisonously at Sir Integra. 
&quot;It&#39;s only because you have all this help and those bloodsuckers that 
you&#39;re still alive here,&quot; she growled at her.

&quot;I highly doubt that is true,&quot; was all Sir Integra said.

The Hellsing leader met Benny halfway, which the tech expert then pulled 
the encased chip from his pocket. &quot;I would like to know what this chip 
is for, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; he asked. &quot;I&#39;ve studied it for some time, 
but I&#39;m drawing a blank about its use.&quot;

&quot;That is on a &#39;need-to-know&#39; basis, Mr. Lieb - and you certainly DO NOT 
need to know,&quot; Sir Integra coldly said.

Benny sighed. &quot;Very well,&quot; he said discouragily. He then extended his 
hand to her, the chip in his palm...

...When a shape suddenly shot out from the bushes, leaped into the air, 
grabbed the chip and landed twenty-five feet away. &quot;Well,&quot; Radinov said, 
the others too surprised to act, &quot;that was so easy, it&#39;s almost a 
disappointment.&quot;

For Rally, the shock wore off quickly. &quot;SO IT IS YOU, RADINOV!!&quot; she 
yelled angrily, her eyes flashing brightly.

&quot;Natasha Radinov?&quot; Sir Integra gasped. &quot;So the reports I received from 
Miss Farrah are true - you have come back from the dead!&quot;

&quot;Indeed I have!&quot; Radinov declared, &quot;and now that I&#39;ve recovered my 
employer&#39;s property, the whole world is going to find out the true 
nature of the gift I&#39;ve been bestowed!&quot;

Of course, Moria was just as surprised as everyone else by Radinov&#39;s 
appearance - so much so that she had relaxed her grip on Revy, which the 
mercenary took advantage of by throwing her off and reaching for her 
gun. But instead of Sir Integra or the maid, she placed Radinov within 
her sights, placing three quick shots at the assassin - two in her open 
chest and one in the head... and was equally surprised at the rate they 
healed. &quot;Oh fuck,&quot; she groaned, &quot;not another bloodsucker?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s impossible!&quot; Rally gasped, surprised at Revy&#39;s failure. &quot;There&#39;s 
no way a FREAK can heal from being shot!&quot;

&quot;You might call me a FREAK, Rally Vincent,&quot; Radinov shot back. &quot;I rather 
refer to myself as the future of nosferatu - in fact, the next evolution 
of them!&quot;

&quot;I doubt it,&quot; Sir Integra countered. &quot;To me, a FREAK is still a FREAK... 
a worthless imitation vampire that my organization is sworn to destroy!&quot;

&quot;What a hypocrite you are, Sir Integra. You yourself are committed to 
ridding the world of vampires and yet you employ the same creatures to 
do your bidding,&quot; Radinov scoffed. &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I shall be 
going off to my employer&#39;s property - but don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t leave you 
with nothing to do. In fact, the playmates I made for you should be 
arriving just about... now.&quot;

As if on cue, the vegetation in front of the group parted, revealing 
hideous, shambling creatures wandering towards them. &quot;Have fun 
everybody,&quot; Radinov said as she took off. &quot;Dosvidaniya!&quot;

&quot;NOT SO FAST, RADINOV!!&quot; Rally yelled, running after the assassin.

&quot;RALLY... WAIT, WE NEED YOUR HELP HERE TO COMBAT THE GHOULS!!&quot; Sir 
Integra called out.

&quot;I CAN&#39;T LET HER GET AWAY WITH THAT CHIP, INTEGRA!!&quot; Rally yelled, &quot;AS 
SOON AS I GET IT, I&#39;LL HELP YOU GUYS OUT!!&quot;

As Radinov made her way through the vegetation, she noted that Rally was 
following her. &#39;So she&#39;s going to follow me... just as I hoped!&#39; Looking 
inside her coat, she took note of the bottles she obtained from Sister 
Yolanda, as well as a hypodermic syringe she had handy.

In the meantime, everyone gathered in a group facing the shambling 
undead. &quot;Rock, Benny,&quot; Dutch called out, &quot;you guys get back to the 
Yellow Flag and take shelter! Me and Revy will handle these cast rejects 
from &#39;Night of the Living Dead&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Miss Hedgley,&quot; Sir Integra added, &quot;you and Miss Farrah accompany Mr. 
Lieb and Mr. Okajima there!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not leaving your side, Sir Integra!&quot; Moria called out, making sure 
her Glock was loaded.

&quot;Very well!&quot; Sir Integra nodded, taking note that Revy had recovered her 
other gun. &quot;People, listen to me - whatever you do, aim for the heart or 
the head of these things! We must not let these ghouls through, no 
matter what!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to tell me twice!&quot; Revy said, grinning upon seeing the 
ghouls. &quot;We&#39;re going to put these fucking compost piles out of their 
misery!&quot; And with that, she opened fire, guns in both hands blazing, 
which in turn had the others firing as well.

As the other three fled to the Yellow Flag, Becky couldn&#39;t help but 
wonder about the others. But her thoughts were diverted when Rock said, 
&quot;We can&#39;t let those guys sacrifice themselves just for our sake.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got news for you, Rock,&quot; Benny said, &quot;but I think those zombies 
got us a bit overmatched! We can&#39;t really be of any help to them!&quot;

&quot;BUT I DO KNOW OF A FEW PEOPLE WHO MIGHT!!&quot; Rock called out. &quot;ALL WE 
HAVE TO DO IS TELL THEM!!&quot;

For Rally, it was tough going slogging through tropical vegetation. She 
was more at home in an urban setting; back streets and alleys were her 
domain. The only palms she saw were either on television or in a 
conservatory. &#39;Crap,&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;maybe I should&#39;ve stayed 
with Integra and Master and fight the ghouls. But if Radinov gets away 
with that chip, there&#39;s no telling what kind of FREAKs that thing will 
spawn!&#39;

But for Radinov, she was equally at home in the jungle as well as the 
city streets. She silently chuckled at the sight of Rally stumbling 
through the foliage, clumsily pushing back fronds in a futile effort to 
locate her.

&#39;I think I&#39;ll play with her a little longer,&#39; she thought, careful to 
leave a false trail for her enemy to follow, &#39;before I spring my trap!&#39;

XXX

The group combating the ghouls found out that, while a ghoul could be 
taken down with gunfire, making sure they stayed down was another 
matter. In two minutes of firing, they were only about to stop at least 
two of about 50 ghouls. &quot;Boy, this is interesting!&quot; Collins managed to 
say, reloading his gun for another round.

&quot;Makes me wish I was back in Grenada fighting alongside the Marines 
against the Cubans!&quot; Vincent added, also firing. &quot;At least dead Cubans 
stayed dead when you shot them!&quot;

&quot;Right now,&quot; Sir Integra gasped, &quot;I would talk less and fire more! Those 
ghouls are gaining ground!&quot;

Then all of a sudden, more shots came from their side, cutting down at 
least five ghouls. Glancing over, the group then sees some of the Yellow 
Flag&#39;s patrons racing to their side, joining the battle. And Bao was 
with them, his shotgun in hand. &quot;Sort of reminds me of Saigon back in 
during Tet in &#39;68, fighting against Charlie!&quot; the bartender said to 
Dutch, which he joined.

&quot;That&#39;s strange, I didn&#39;t recall asking for your help, Bao!&quot; Dutch said, 
reloading his revolver.

&quot;You should thank Rock for that, Dutch!&quot; Bao replied, grinning. &quot;He 
burst into the bar with Benny and that girl, saying you needed help! At 
first, we couldn&#39;t believe what he said, but after we saw the situation, 
we figured we better help!&quot; He blasted a ghoul apart before adding, 
&quot;Besides, do think I&#39;d allow a bunch of stinking zombies to wreck my 
bar? There&#39;s no way in hell I can get payment from them if they did!&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you would,&quot; Dutch grinned, once again firing.

&quot;Nice to know about ze reminiscing,&quot; Pip added, &quot;but we still have a job 
to do!&quot; Dutch nodded as the group continued to blast away.

Rally found herself wandering into a clearing some distance away from 
the Yellow Flag. Anticipating a trap, she drew her gun and tightened all 
her vampiric senses, but detected nothing. &#39;I don&#39;t like this,&#39; she 
thought to herself. &#39;Normally, I can detect a FREAK from two miles away, 
but I&#39;m getting nothing from Radinov! It has to be that chip she 
snatched! She must have a similar one inside her! If that&#39;s true...&#39; 
Shuttering, she cleared her mind and continued her search.

All of a sudden, though, Rally found herself struck from behind. 
Dropping and rolling, she drew to the source of the attack but found 
nothing. &quot;ALRIGHT RADINOV, I KNOW YOU&#39;RE HERE, SO COME OUT INTO THE 
OPEN!!&quot; she yelled. Nothing. &quot;Fucking coward!&quot; she snarled. Disgusted, 
she got up to search again - only to fall to her knees when her crotch 
is savagely kicked from behind!

Falling into a fetal position, Rally could only concentrate on the pain 
- until she heard Radinov&#39;s mocking laughter above her. &quot;Really,&quot; the 
assassin laughed, &quot;it&#39;s not like you to utter such insults, Rally 
Vincent.&quot; She then grinned as she added, &quot;Like I said before, I am the 
next evolution of a vampire, while you are just the original model... 
full of defects and deficiencies!&quot;

&quot;Screw... you, Radinov!&quot; Rally managed to say, the pain in her crotch 
lessening. &quot;I... am... true undead... not some copy like you!&quot;

The grin on Radinov&#39;s face grew crueler. &quot;So you say. I can still walk 
in the daylight, eat normal foods just like a human. You&#39;re limited to 
the night and drinking blood!&quot; She then produced a small bottle from the 
sleeve of her coat as she said, &quot;And also you have another defect that I 
DON&#39;T HAVE - one that I will demonstrate right now!&quot; Aiming the bottle 
at Rally&#39;s face, she squeezed it, spraying liquid around her eyes.

&quot;AAAUUGGHH!!&quot; Rally stumbled backwards as the liquid sizzled on her skin 
- and worse, some of it splashed into her eyes, burning them. She opened 
them, but all she saw was a blur. &quot;CRAP... BURNS...&quot;

Radinov laughed, seeing Rally stumble about. &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; she 
mocked. &quot;All I did was squirt a little water on you!&quot; The grin on her 
face grew as she hissed, &quot;Holy water that is!&quot;

&#39;Holy water?&#39; Rally thought, panicking. &#39;Crap! No wonder it burns so 
bad! Feels like Anderson&#39;s knives against my face!&#39; Desperately, she 
managed to open her eyes, somehow discerning Radinov&#39;s blurry image and 
charged at it. But when she did, the assassin cruely elbowed the back of 
her neck, causing the vampire to fall to the ground.

Then Radinov produced the hypodermic and filled it with the holy water. 
&quot;I do not have any vulnerability to holy articles, while you are 
laid-low by them,&quot; she smirked. &quot;You know, I have a bit of curiosity 
about what would happen if I did this!&quot; And with that, she bent down and 
jabbed the needle into Rally.

THE GHOUL BATTLE, AROUND THE SAME TIME...

&quot;Sir Integra,&quot; Moria said, still blasting the ghouls, &quot;we&#39;re running low 
on ammunition and these ghouls are still coming!&quot;

&quot;I know! But we cannot stop, no matter what!&quot; the Hellsing leader 
declared. Indeed, the ghouls were gaining ground on the defenders, some 
of the Yellow Flag&#39;s customers actually attacked and torn apart by them 
- with some of those not consumed rising as ghouls themselves!

&quot;DAMMIT ALL TO HELL!!&quot; Bao yelled, seeing another of his patrons 
transformed. &quot;THAT WAS ONE OF MY BEST CUSTOMERS, TOO!!&quot; Turning, he 
blasted the ghoul responsible, along with mercifully ending the 
transformed&#39;s misery.

&quot;Dutch, I don&#39;t like this!&quot; Revy gasped as the group fell back further. 
&quot;We keep shooting and shooting but these fucking zombies just keep 
coming, no matter what!&quot;

&quot;Tell me something I DON&#39;T know!&quot; Dutch yelled, trying to find more 
ammo.

Pip, in the meantime, stood next to Seras, covering her as she reloaded. 
&quot;Mignonette,&quot; he said, &quot;just in case we don&#39;t make it, there&#39;s something 
I need to tell you...&quot;

&quot;Tell it to me later, we&#39;re not dead yet!&quot; the Draculina shot back, 
cocking her pistol and aimed at the ghouls...

... Only to find a massive barrage cutting-down the ghouls. Some of them 
did get up, only to get shot again. And the shooting only stopped when 
the last ghoul evaporated into ash, causing the would-be victims to 
stand and gape.

&quot;Uh... what just happened?&quot; Collins asked.

But before anyone could answer, Seras looked over to the source of the 
barrage, a patch of gloom. &quot;Sir Integra!&quot; she called-out. &quot;There&#39;s a 
large group of armed men advancing towards us!&quot; Indeed from the 
darkness, a considerable group of men, wearing army uniforms and armed 
with Russian-made submachine guns was gradually advancing towards the 
group.

Vincent, Seras, Collins, Moria and Sir Integra, as well as Bao and some 
of the surviving customers took up positions, drawing down at the 
mysterious group. Dutch and Revy, however, relaxed their guard. &quot;She 
better show up soon,&quot; the brown-haired girl whispered, &quot;otherwise 
there&#39;s going to be one big fuck-up going down.&quot; Dutch just nodded.

It didn&#39;t take long before, &quot;DESANTNIKI - STAND DOWN!!&quot; Immedietly, the 
men lowered their aim and stood at attention. Then walking from the 
darkness, Balalaika took a look at the small group. Motioning to Boris, 
who walked to her side, she said, &quot;Sergeant, secure the area and make 
sure there are no more of these horrors lurking about!&quot;

&quot;Da, Captain!&quot; Boris replied, saluting. He then barked-out orders in 
Russian and several of the Desantniki took up positions around the area.

In the meantime, Vincent was whispering in Sir Integra&#39;s ear, telling 
her what he knew. &quot;I see,&quot; she said, nodding. &quot;Well, I guess I should 
get myself acquainted with our savior here.&quot; She then stepped up to the 
Russian woman, a neutral but firm look on her face.

Balalaika, obviously impressed, decided to advance as well, smiling as 
she did. When the two women were at a distance of a meter of each other. 
&quot;So, we meet at last,&quot; she began. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to be Sir Integra 
Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, the ascendant of the legendary vampire 
hunter Abraham Van Helsing?&quot;

&quot;That I am,&quot; Sir Integra said. &quot;Well, you seem to have me at a 
disadvantage. You know me, but all I got from Mr. Vincent is that you 
are the legendary commander of the Desantniki - one of the most brutal 
divisions in the Soviet Union&#39;s Afghan campaign.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re still saying that about me,&quot; Balalaika mused. &quot;I&#39;m flattered. 
But it was war, and in war sometimes you make decisions that you must 
live with for the rest of your life. Granted, I did make terrible 
commands during that conflict, wiping-out innocent civilians because of 
a few that hurt my men. And that I will bear until my dying day.&quot;

Sir Integra took this in, nodding. &quot;That is true. You have my thanks for 
your aid, but right now we have a major crisis on our hands.&quot;

&quot;Yes, about that,&quot; Dutch put in. &quot;Sir Hellsing, just what the hell was 
that chip that Revy took in the first place - and don&#39;t give us that 
&#39;need-to-know&#39; shit!&quot;

&quot;I would like to know that, too,&quot; Benny put in, he, Rock and Becky 
returning. &quot;Dutch, Rock saw what was happening and gave us the 
all-clear.&quot;

&quot;Very well, since you have seen the results, it is only fair that you 
know.&quot; Sir Integra cleared her throat before beginning. &quot;That chip is a 
control circuit, specifically designed to create artificial vampires.&quot;

&quot;Artificial vampires?&quot; Benny queried. &quot;Is that possible?&quot;

&quot;My organization has been fighting these FREAKs as we call them for some 
time,&quot; said Sir Integra. &quot;However, this a new chip we are dealing with, 
apparently with the ability to create FREAKs from the bodies of the 
deceased and give them healing abilities. Otherwise, how else can it be 
explained about the current existence of Natasha Radinov.&quot;

A collective gasp was then heard from the membership of the Desantniki. 
Several of them began to talk among themselves - some of there voices, 
in fact, had terrified tones to them. And a few sounded as if angry.

Even Balalaika was stunned, her brow furrowing. &quot;Bloody Pierce... 
alive?&quot; she said.

Sir Integra, as well as the others, were surprised at this reaction. 
&quot;You are familiar with Radinov, I see,&quot; she mused.

&quot;The reputation of Bloody Pierce is well-known among my men,&quot; the 
Russian continued. &quot;In fact, some of them had been unfortunate victims 
of her tactics. That woman was a monster, the worst the K.G.B. had ever 
produced!&quot; Balalaika then cast her green eyes at the Hellsing leader and 
added, &quot;If you need any help in eliminating this menace, then you&#39;ll 
have my help as well!&quot;

&quot;I appreciate your aid, but at this moment, one of my agents is at this 
moment pursuing Radinov,&quot; Sir Integra said, &quot;and hopefully, we may 
expect results, just as soon...&quot;

&quot;YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHH!!&quot; The length and volume of Rally&#39;s 
scream startled everyone gather.

Seras felt her insides tightening. &quot;Oh my god... RALLY!!&quot; The Draculina 
then darted for the source of the scream. Moria, also concerned, 
followed her, along with the others.

XXX

&quot;AAAUUUGGGHHH!! OH GOD... BURNS.... YEEEEEEAAAAAUUUUGGGHHHH!!&quot; Rally was 
on the ground, quivering and shaking from the effect of the holy water 
inside her body. Several blotchy patches had appeared on her skin, with 
some of them openly smoldering.

And standing over her, Radinov was grinning. &quot;Does it burn, Rally 
Vincent?&quot; she smirked, walking over the helpless vampire. &quot;Does your 
insides feel like an inferno burning from within? Now you see the truth 
- the time of the original vampire is at an end! Compared to me you are 
weak!&quot; She savagely kicked Rally in the stomach, forcing her on her back 
while she knelt down, another bottle of holy water in her hands. &quot;Now 
what I want to hear is your pleas for mercy! She slapped Rally&#39;s face, 
&quot;GO ON... ASK ME TO SPARE YOUR MISERABLE UNLIFE!!&quot;

All she got was Rally spitting in her face. &quot;Go... fuck yourself, 
Radinov!&quot; she managed to say, the blurred image of Radinov&#39;s face 
growing clearer.

&quot;Sorry, but I don&#39;t have the proper equipment,&quot; Radinov smirked, 
unscrewing the cap from the bottle. &quot;From the look in your eyes, you 
still wish to kill me.&quot; She wiped the spittle from her face before 
saying, &quot;Well, I might as well get rid of that look right now!&quot; And then 
she slowly poured the contents of the bottle into Rally&#39;s eyes, causing 
a huge cloud of seared flesh to billow.

&quot;AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!&quot; Rally shrieked, the pain almost too much for her to 
bear. &quot;MASTER, HELP MEEEEEE!!&quot;

BANG!!

&quot;ERRRGH!!&quot; Radinov flinched as a bullet hit the top of her hand, causing 
her to drop the bottle. Turning around, she found Seras charging out of 
the underbrush, gun in hand.

&quot;GET AWAY FROM HER, YOU BITCH!!&quot; the Draculina yelled, getting off 
another shot but missing.

&quot;Damn.&quot; She could tell from the commotion behind Seras that more were 
coming. &quot;I&#39;ve got to get away from here!&quot; Getting up from the quivering 
Rally, she charged into the jungle, where several of the Desantniki made 
pursuit.

&quot;Hold on, Rally!&quot; Seras said, rolling the dusky vampire on her back, 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m here! Just hang on and...&quot; Seras&#39; eyes widened in 
horror. &quot;OH MY GOD!?&quot; she gasped.

The area where Rally&#39;s eyes were was carbonized, empty, blackened 
sockets just looked back, the eyes destroyed. Slowly, a quivering hand 
reached out for Seras&#39; face. &quot;M-Master?&quot; Rally whimpered, &quot;I-I can&#39;t 
see. Is that you?&quot;

Bloody tears streaming from her eyes, Seras held Rally close to her. 
&quot;Yes... it&#39;s me, Rally,&quot; she choked out.

&quot;It-it-it hurts... it hurts everywhere!&quot; Rally gasped, then she 
tightened up as a spasm of pain hit. &quot;AAAAUUUUGGGGGHHHH!!&quot;

Several of the group made their way to the clearing. Sir Integra looked 
aghast at Rally&#39;s condition. &quot;Dear God, no!&quot; she gasped.

Moria, who was behind Sir Integra, just held her hands over her mouth in 
shock, then quickly joined Seras in comforting Rally.

Revy, in the meantime, was numb with shock over the sight she beheld. 
Down on the ground, she happened to see Rally&#39;s CZ-75, but was reluctant 
to pick it up with what she saw next - namely the look of blind rage in 
Seras&#39; blood-stained face, a rage directed at Radinov. Noticing the 
person next to her, she whispered, &quot;Rock, why don&#39;t you give the blonde 
Rally&#39;s gun.&quot;

&quot;I thought you wanted it,&quot; Rock also whispered.

&quot;I&#39;ve changed my mind,&quot; Revy added. &quot;From the look that girl&#39;s face, I&#39;d 
probably get a worse ass-kicking that what I got with that maid.&quot; She 
then continued to look at the three, wishing all sorts of ill towards 
the cause of Rally&#39;s torment.
