<h1>Through the Years (part 10 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gunsmith/index.html">Gunsmith Cats</a>

<a href="../gunsmith/thruyears-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>GOLDIE MUSO&#39;S HIDEAWAY MANSION...
 
&quot;BOSS!!!!  ARE YOU OKAY!?!  WE HEARD A SHOT UPSTAIRS!!!&quot; one of the two 
sole male occupants of the mansion yelled out as he and his companion 
race out into the landing of the first floor.  They were surprised to 
see Goldie Muso struggling to make it downstairs, clutching her broken 
left wrist.
 
&quot;About time you two showed up!&quot; the beautiful crimelord snarled.  &quot;Look, 
I have no time to explain.  I want you two to stop Rally Vincent; I 
don&#39;t care how you do it!  Just don&#39;t let her get to me!&quot;
 
&quot;But what about the girls?  Weren&#39;t THEY supposed to protect you?&quot; the 
second thug asked.
 
Before Goldie could explain, Rally Vincent&#39;s voice called-out from the 
second story, a pleasantly sweet, yet sinister tone to it.  &quot;Yoo-hoo!  
Oh Goldie, where are you?  Aw c&#39;mon Goldie, I thought we were going to 
have dinner together... with you as the dinner!&quot;
 
Terrified, Goldie just turned to the guards as she grabbed her coat from 
a nearby closet and said, &quot;I&#39;m afraid they&#39;re a non-issue!  Just make 
sure she doesn&#39;t get to the garage!  Shoot her if you have to, just 
don&#39;t let her reach me!&quot;  Before the guards could ask for more 
information, she fled in the direction of the below-level garage.
 
The two guards looked thunderstruck at the panicked expression of their 
employer.  &quot;Geez,&quot; the first one said, &quot;she&#39;s usually so in control of 
things.  Wonder what got her so rattled?&quot;
 
&quot;I think I know what - or rather... who,&quot; the second guard said in a 
trembling voice, pointing upwards.  
 
His fellow followed the finger, where Rally, now a vampire, stood on the 
upstairs landing and looked at the men banefully with blood-red eyes.  
&quot;If you guys value your lives, then I suggest you get out of my way... 
otherwise, you&#39;re my lunch,&quot; she said coldly.
 
Without warning, the men pulled out submachine guns and began firing... 
and were alarmed as Rally easily dodged the bullets at a speed no human 
could match.  &quot;Oh well,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;I guess before I get to 
the main course, I&#39;m going to have to start with a couple of 
appetizers.&quot;  She had stopped long enough to again stare at the 
guards... this time eyeing them hungrily.
 
Trembling at the dark-haired vampire&#39;s glance, the first guard looked to 
his friend and asked, &quot;W-w-what do we do now?&quot;
 
&quot;WHO THE HELL CARES, JUST KEEP SHOOTING!!!&quot; the second yelled, firing at 
Rally.  This time, she didn&#39;t bother to dodge the bullets, allowing them 
to strike through her as she dived at the second man from the balcony - 
and sank her fangs into his neck!
 
Screaming, the first man watched in horror as Rally fed on his dying 
partner, then looked up at him after she finished.  Her lips, smiling 
evilly, were dripping with the man&#39;s blood, and her eyes had a wild look 
to them.  &quot;Y-Y-Y-YOU&#39;RE A MONSTER!!&quot; he stammered, &quot;A MONSTER!!!&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe,&quot; Rally purred, licking her bloodied lips as she dropped the body 
of the second guard and stood up, &quot;but then again... who are you?&quot; she 
said, stalking the second guard.

Goldie had a problem trying to fish the keys out of her coat pocket, 
mostly because they were in the left pocket... and it was difficult to 
grasp the coat easily, mostly because the throbbing of her left wrist 
was incredible, and her nerves were jangling from the adrenaline running 
in her veins.  Somehow, she had gotten the keys of the BMW parked in the 
garage and had opened the doors.
 
&quot;NO-NO!!!  STAY AWAY!!!  STAY AWAY!!!  YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!&quot; came a 
scream from upstairs.  Gritting her teeth in terror, Goldie dove inside 
the car, started the engine and opened the garage doors.  However, 
before she could exit, a small explosion erupted in front of her, then 
the passenger side seat shattered next to her and the right rear door 
had a hole blown in it, followed with a spray of oil and water from the 
hood, not to mention the car dying as a result.
 
Quickly getting out to examine the damage, Goldie glanced in front of 
her and saw another individual in front of the garage door - a young 
blonde-haired woman that was wearing a yellow miniskirt uniform and 
carrying what appeared to be one of the largest guns the crimelord had 
ever saw.
 
Jacking the spent shell from the breech of the Harkonnen cannon, Seras 
Victoria stared hard at Goldie as she slammed another shell in.  &quot;I 
would advise you not to leave, Miss Muso,&quot; she replied plainly, closing 
the breech.  &quot;My fledgling still wants to have a word with you!&quot;
 
Goldie studied her options.  She could head out the pedestrian exit and 
run to safety... but the staircase to the main floor was nearby, and she 
could tell Rally was coming.  Quickly, she took the door to the 
mechanical room.  It was a longer route, but it would eventually lead 
back to the main floor and a possible escape.
 
Oddly, Seras just stood and watched Goldie run into the room, smiling.  
Rally soon came into the garage; blood splattered on her turtleneck, and 
was surprised with the guest in the garage.  Pointing to the mechanical 
room, the Draculina called out, &quot;I only made sure Goldie didn&#39;t leave.  
She went that way.&quot;
 
&quot;Gee... thanks, Master,&quot; Rally replied, leaping from the door to the 
garage floor.  &quot;You sure you don&#39;t want to join me?&quot;
 
&quot;Goldie&#39;s your hunt, Rally.  You need the experience, so I better not 
interfere,&quot; Seras shrugged.  &quot;Just be sure not to lose control while you 
do it.  Oh... and while you&#39;re at it, be sure to clean up your messes 
afterwards.&quot;  
 
&quot;Will do,&quot; Rally answered back, flipping a jaunty salute as she followed 
Goldie into the bowels of the house.  Before she did, she looked at the 
wreckage of the BWM and thought to herself, &#39;Too bad about the Beemer.  
Master really screwed up one sweet ride.&#39;
 
&#39;Sorry Rally... but it couldn&#39;t be helped,&#39; Seras apologized in Rally&#39;s 
head.
 
Rally frowned.  &#39;Geez, Master... could you please not listen in on my 
thoughts?  I still like to have a few things to myself, if you don&#39;t 
mind.&#39; she grumbled in her thoughts.
 
&#39;Sorry about that, Rally.  Wait until I tell you about all the times 
that Alucard intruded on MY thoughts,&#39; Seras laughed.
 
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be a laugh,&quot; Rally grumbled out loud, but still smiling.

Upstairs, &#39;Minnie&#39; May Hopkins shuttered hearing all the gunshots and 
yelling.  Like Rally had asked her, she had disarmed the sleeping wards 
of Goldie, placing the guns in a pillowcase.  She then went into the 
adjoining room and found her street clothes and explosives (she was 
still dressed in her bunny costume).  Before she could undress, however, 
she heard the guards&#39; dying screams, and was terrified about what her 
friend was doing to them.  &quot;Please Rally,&quot; she whimpered to herself, &quot;be 
careful.  I know you&#39;re a vampire now... but I don&#39;t want you to lose 
yourself when you kill Goldie.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh I&#39;m certain Rally can control herself,&quot; Alucard&#39;s voice came from 
the darkness.  Startled, May turned around to see the No-Life King 
standing behind her.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry if I were you, Miss Hopkins.  I 
have faith that Seras will be able to keep a short leash on her, not to 
mention Rally still has a little of her human sensibilities not to go 
too far.&quot;
 
&quot;Well I hope you&#39;re right,&quot; the blonde explosive expert answered.  &quot;I 
just hate to think what could happen if Rally were to suddenly go 
berserk and start killing innocents.&quot;
 
&quot;I would think that it would be very unpleasant if that were to happen,&quot; 
Alucard said with a fiendish smile.  &quot;But she will not allow it - Rally 
Vincent has the potential to become a very powerful nosferatu, but she 
will not allow the darkness to totally consume her.&quot;  He then gathered 
May in his arms and added, &quot;In the meantime, I had best take you away 
from this place.  It has become very dangerous in this house, and you 
might get caught in the fray unintentionally, which would upset Rally 
greatly.&quot;
 
&quot;I guess,&quot; May shrugged.  Smiling, Alucard then held the girl tightly as 
the two faded from the room.

The roundabout route Goldie took through the mechanical rooms took her 
back to the main room, where she discovered several alarming things.  
First of all, the front door had been blocked by several heavy pieces of 
furniture, which would be impossible for her to move with her broken 
wrist.  But most of all, she saw several blood stains on the floor... 
but no bodies.
 
&quot;I don&#39;t understand this,&quot; Goldie managed to gasp, still in pain.  
&quot;She&#39;s killed my guards but where are the bodies?&quot;  Looking around, she 
fled into the dining room and looked into the kitchen entrance.  &quot;Of 
course... I&#39;ll go out the back way, then somehow hotwire Rally&#39;s car to 
leave.&quot;  She looked at her broken wrist, &quot;Might be a little hard with 
this... but then again, I&#39;ve managed with less.&quot;  Making her way into 
the hallway, she used her one good hand to open the door... and stumbled 
back screaming.
 
The guards were there; only thing was they were no longer human.  They 
were now hideous ghouls, eyes glowing as they reacted to what they 
perceived as food.  Running back to the dining room, Goldie tripped over 
her feet and fell to the floor, twisting her ankle.  Sitting herself up, 
she managed to scoot into a corner, where she used the only weapon at 
her disposal - the gun she somehow managed to keep - and fired a shot 
into both ghouls each.  The ghouls hesitated briefly as the shots hit, 
then proceeded towards Goldie, who could only sit in terror as they 
approached, then bent down to grab her...
 
&quot;ALRIGHT YOU TWO... DROP DEAD!!!&quot; Rally&#39;s voice snarled.  Almost at 
once, the ghouls stopped, violently convulsed, and then quickly crumbled 
into dust.  Goldie&#39;s relief at this was short-lived, mostly because she 
caught sight of Rally, who was standing behind where the ghouls stood.  
&quot;Sorry about that, Goldie,&quot; she began, walking calmly towards the 
crimelord, &quot;I should&#39;ve realized that those guys weren&#39;t virgins and 
would end up like what they were.  Don&#39;t worry... I won&#39;t let you die at 
their hands.&quot;
 
&quot;NO!!  NO!!!  STAY BACK!!! STAAAY BAAAACK!!!!&quot; Goldie shrieked, 
discharging her gun until empty at Rally, whereas the bullets simply 
went through her and instantly healed.  Seeing that none of her efforts 
could stop her, Goldie simply threw the gun at Rally, but the vampire 
caught the gun in her right hand and crushed it.  
 
&quot;Shame,&quot; Rally muttered as she dropped the crumpled gun, &quot;It was a 
really nice Beretta, too.&quot;  She then stopped and looked down at Goldie, 
who was now reduced to a shaking, crying wreck.
 
&quot;Rally... Rally,&quot; Goldie managed to sob, &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry about this 
whole mess!  I... I didn&#39;t mean for you to get hurt in that warehouse!  
I was only...&quot; but then screamed in terror as Rally grabbed her by the 
collar and forced to her feet.
 
The dark-haired vampire simply looked at the shaking Goldie coldly in 
the eye and said, &quot;I hate to say this, but I&#39;m afraid this whole thing 
has gone beyond apologies, Goldie.  My life... my HUMAN life... is over.  
Because of you, I now have to face seeing all the people in my life that 
I love and treasure age and die before my eyes... while I&#39;ll still be 
looking young and beautiful.  You think you&#39;re scared because you&#39;re 
about to die... but right now, I&#39;d give all I have just to die a human.  
Having to face eternity scares me the most.&quot;  
 
Rally then leaned close to Goldie&#39;s face, causing the crimelord to 
cringe.  &quot;I&#39;m going to give you one last gift before you die, Goldie.  
Think of it as &#39;a going-away present&#39; from the old country.&quot;  She then 
bent forward and kissed Goldie in the lips... but this was a kiss 
without passion, although she did linger in kissing her.  
 
Goldie&#39;s eyes widened in horror... she knew the meaning of this kiss, a 
Sicilian mafia tradition of assassins going back for many years.  
Through Rally&#39;s mouth, her sobbing increased, and as Rally drew back, 
tears began flowing like a torrent.  &quot;Rally... Rally, please... no... I 
don&#39;t want to die...&quot; she whimpered, slowly shaking her head.
 
All that Rally could think about, seeing what was once a cruel, 
controlling woman who only cared about ruining lives reduced to a 
sobbing, quaking mess, was the whole irony of the situation.  No longer 
smiling, the vampire looked Goldie in the eye and whispered, &quot;Goodnight, 
Goldie.&quot;  She then tilted her head slightly... and slowly bent down 
towards Goldie&#39;s neck. 
 
The minute Goldie caught a glimpse of the gleaming fangs in Rally&#39;s 
mouth, she lost all control of her emotions.  &quot;RALLY, NO-NO... 
NOOOOOOOO!!!&quot; she cried, feeling them penetrate into her jungular vein.  
She tried to push Rally off, but the later grasped her firmly, holding 
her fast.
 
Rally was in no hurry as she felt Goldie&#39;s blood rushing into her mouth.  
Unlike the guards, she took her time consuming it, savoring the warm, 
ferric taste while Goldie struggled.  She wanted Goldie to suffer, to 
die slowly and in terror - somehow it made the blood taste better.  
 
But as she was feeding, Rally began to see images in her mind - images 
of Goldie giving a mysterious man a sheet of paper - possibly the 
Kerasine formula she mentioned earlier.  The man, which resembled the 
stereotypical &#39;mad scientist&#39; from some old &quot;B&quot; movie, wore eyeglasses 
with multiple lenses, then handed Goldie an armored briefcase.  As the 
two shaked hands, Rally noticed the right hand of the man.  He wore 
gloves, but she saw that the third finger looked doubled - almost as if 
he had an extra finger on that hand.
 
For the next two minutes, Goldie continued to struggle against Rally, 
her movement growing more and feebler.  At the same time, her breathing 
became shallower and more labored, and Rally could hear her heartbeat 
gradually slowing... until all three stopped and Goldie became limp.  
Rally continued to drink until there was no more, then lifted her head 
and set Goldie&#39;s body on the floor.  Licking the remaining blood from 
her lips, she stared at the body for about ten seconds before drawing 
her CZ-75 - thankfully modified by Walter beforehand - and released the 
safety.
 
Two shots, one in the heart and one in the head, Rally had placed into 
Goldie, to assure she wouldn&#39;t rise either as a vampire or a ghoul.  
Once finished, she clicked the safety back and holstered the gun, then 
knelt down before Goldie, her face neutral of any emotion.
 
After two more minutes, Seras, her Harkonnen on her shoulders, walked in 
and stood behind her fledgling.  &quot;Any regrets?&quot; she asked, placing her 
hand on Rally&#39;s shoulder.
 
Rally just shrugged as she stood up.  &quot;No... it&#39;s just that... all this 
time, I&#39;ve dreamed of finally getting rid of Goldie once and for all.  
Now that it&#39;s done... you won&#39;t believe this, Master... but for some 
reason I feel like another part of me had just died.&quot;  She turned to 
Seras and added, &quot;Do you think that&#39;s crazy?&quot;
 
&quot;Who knows?&quot; Seras answered, giving Rally a peck on the cheek.  &quot;Maybe 
Goldie was that part that gave you a reason to fight back.  I&#39;m not 
certain if you&#39;ll find another one like her for a while... however long 
it will be.&quot;  She then smiled and added, &quot;I hope you remembered to blot 
out the memory of you and May&#39;s visit here from Goldie&#39;s girls.&quot;
 
&quot;That was the first thing that was on my mind when I put those girls to 
sleep,&quot; replied Rally.  &quot;All they&#39;ll remember is that SOMEONE came to 
the house but not remember who or that May was there as well.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s good.  Look, Rally... I&#39;ll go on ahead and let the others know 
it&#39;s done.  You take the Cobra and drive on out of here.  We&#39;ll meet at 
the designated point.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;ve got it, Master,&quot; Rally smiled.
 
As soon as Seras departed, Rally made a quick sweep of the house, taking 
care to wipe everything she touched, although it was possible that 
vampires couldn&#39;t leave fingerprints but she wanted to make sure.  Then 
taking one last look at Goldie&#39;s body, she left the house, cleaning the 
knob and rails as she did.  She then entered the Cobra and started the 
engine.  As she left the house, she thought back about the past few 
days.  &#39;Well... so ends a chapter in my old life.  Trouble is... now 
that Goldie&#39;s gone, how is my future going to shape up?  That is... if I 
got a future to look forward to.&#39;

Several minutes passed in the park where the group waited for Seras and 
Rally to return.  Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing leaned against 
the limo that she borrowed from the embassy extension,  patiently 
puffing on her cigar as she did.  Walter C. Dolnez, her friend and 
butler, also waited next to her.  &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be long now, Ma&#39;am,&quot; he 
offered.
 
&quot;I know, Walter,&quot; answered the Hellsing leader.  &quot;Alucard has already 
gave word to me of their success.  It is just that... there&#39;s Rally&#39;s 
future that we must attend to after their return.&quot;  Walter nodded in 
agreement.
 
Detective Roy Coleman then walked up to the two, closing the cell phone 
as he did.  &quot;I&#39;ve gotten a call from the precinct,&quot; he began.  
&quot;Apparently... there&#39;s been a... shall I say... an anomalous tip about a 
disturbance at or near Goldie&#39;s house.  So if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m 
going to have to attend to it.  Could you tell Rally that I&#39;m sorry and 
I couldn&#39;t be here when she gets back?&quot;
 
&quot;I am certain she will understand, Detective,&quot; Sir Integra replied.  
&quot;There is one thing I do like to know... why are you so understanding 
about Rally killing Goldie in the first place?  Normally, police do not 
approve of such... arrangements.&quot;
 
&quot;Let&#39;s face it... Goldie&#39;s been asking for it for some time, but for one 
reason or another she got away.  She&#39;s messed up Rally&#39;s life so much, I 
wouldn&#39;t blame her for doing so.  Besides,&quot; Coleman added with a smile, 
&quot;I really don&#39;t think the law applies to a dead person... and Rally IS 
dead, isn&#39;t she?&quot;
 
Sir Integra also smiled.  &quot;You have such an interesting way of 
rationalizing matters, Detective Coleman.&quot;
 
&quot;Please, just &#39;Roy&#39;, Sir Integra,&quot; Coleman said, departing, &quot;I&#39;ll see if 
I can get away from this soon.  I&#39;ll meet you at Rally&#39;s house.&quot;  Going 
up to the restroom building, he called out into the women&#39;s side, &quot;Be 
sure to lock up after you&#39;re finished, May.&quot; 
 
&quot;You&#39;ve got it, Roy,&quot; May&#39;s voice answered from inside.  As soon as 
Coleman departed, May exited the restroom, finally rid of that awful 
bunny suit and dressed in her normal clothing.  &quot;Thank goodness I&#39;m rid 
of that piece of trash!&quot; she sighed, locking the restroom door behind 
her.  &quot;As soon as I get home, I&#39;m going to throw that thing away.  Any 
word if Rally&#39;s coming, Integra?&quot; she asked.
 
Before Sir Integra could answer, Alucard appeared out of nowhere.  &quot;I 
wouldn&#39;t worry if I were you, Miss Hopkins.  We should be hearing from 
them any minute now.&quot;
 
As if on cue, Seras landed in front of the group, carrying her 
Harkonnen.  &quot;I went out ahead of Rally, Master, Sir Integra,&quot; she said, 
not sounding the least breathless.  &quot;I can tell she got out of there 
without incident.&quot;
 
&quot;I see,&quot; Sir Integra answered.  &quot;Very good, Seras.  You and your 
fledgling should be commended on ridding the world of that menace.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m not certain, Sir Integra,&quot; the Draculina replied.  &quot;From what I&#39;ve 
learned from Rally&#39;s mind when she drank Miss Muso&#39;s blood, she may have 
found another threat we may have to face.&quot;
 
Sir Integra nodded.  &quot;It must be about those who purchased the Kerasine 
formula that May had told us about.  Well, I think we may learn more 
about it once Rally returns.&quot;
 
Everyone&#39;s attention soon turns to a set of headlights illuminating in 
the distance.  Rally&#39;s Cobra soon crested the hill and stopped opposite 
of where the group was situated.  As soon as the engine shut down, Rally 
opened the door and exited the car.  &quot;Well everyone... Goldie&#39;s finally 
gone.&quot;  She then eyed Sir Integra, who was staring intently at her, and 
offered, &quot;So Integra, what is so important that we have to...&quot;
 
(THUNK)
 
Suddenly, everyone stood in shock as they stared at Rally.  From the 
dark-haired vampire perspective, the surprise was just as great as she 
looked down to stare at her right shoulder... which now had one of 
Paladin Alexander Anderson&#39;s bayonets inside it.  The shock wore off 
quickly, followed by extreme, burning pain - worse than when she was 
stabbed by Radinov - as Rally cried out while collapsing to her knees.
 
&quot;RALLY!!!&quot; May cried out as she tried to race to her friend, only to be 
restrained by Sir Integra and Becky.
 
&quot;Ye did well tryin&#39; t&#39; hold &#39;er back, Sir Integra,&quot; Anderson called out 
from the shadows ahead of Rally, causing Seras and Alucard to draw their 
weapons in that direction as the priest walked out.  &quot;All Ah have t&#39; do 
now is t&#39; plunge another blade into &#39;er cursed heart and take &#39;er &#39;ead.  
Then it&#39;ll be the end of another filthy vampire fer sure.&quot;
 
&quot;Stay away from my fledgling, Paladin Anderson!&quot; Seras challenged, 
aiming her Harkonnen at the Iscariot priest.
 
&quot;I would listen to the Draculina, Judas Priest!&quot; Alucard added, aiming 
his Jackal as well.  &quot;Rally Vincent is under our protection!  Leave 
while you still can... or suffer the consequences!&quot; 
 
Anderson just sneered at the two.  &quot;Ye still think ye can intimidate me 
with yer puny weapons, Alucard?  Don&#39;t worry... as soon as I put this 
hellborn fledgling t&#39; rest, Ah&#39;ll deal with the rest of ye stinkin&#39; 
vampires as well!&quot;  Drawing two more bayonets from his cassock sleeves, 
the priest began to whisper a prayer as he further stalked towards 
Rally, who was struggling to remove the bayonet in her shoulder, her 
hands smoldering as she touched the blessed handle.
 
Quickly, Alucard and Seras took up positions along side the fallen 
Rally.  &quot;So be it, Catholic fool,&quot; Alucard snarled, once again taking 
aim with Seras.  But just as they were about to fire, they were 
distracted by a hand quaking in the air, requesting them to stop.
 
&quot;Alucard... Master...&quot; Rally managed to say, smiling at them, &quot;I... 
appreciate the gesture... but I can fight my own battles, thank you.&quot;  
Then angrily staring bullets at Anderson with eyes glowing red, she 
forced herself to stand up, then with a great effort pulled the bayonet 
out of her shoulder with both hands.  However, she doesn&#39;t let go, 
despite the knife sizzling in her right hand.  &quot;Okay Anderson, you 
son-of-a-bitch,&quot; she snarled, &quot;you want to take me on... you&#39;ve got 
it... but for your sake, you had better bring your &quot;A&quot; game for this 
one, because you&#39;re dealing with one pissed-off vampire here!  Because 
for the last day and a half, my friend was kidnapped and held for 
ransom, I&#39;ve been buried in a ton of concrete, I&#39;ve died, then came back 
and killed the one who kidnapped my friend, and I&#39;m not going to let a 
crazed, self-righteous son-of-a-bitch like you get the best of me 
tonight!&quot;  All during Rally&#39;s tirade, everyone notices writhing black 
tendrils dancing around her, their movements increasing with the level 
of her ire.
 
&quot;R-Rally?  What are you doing?&quot; Becky whimpered, suddenly frightened by 
what was transpiring.
 
Alucard broke out in a great smile.  &quot;Magnificent!&quot; he exclaims.  &quot;Her 
first night as a vampire and already she is summoning her familiars!  
She IS going to be a very powerful vampire!&quot;
 
Indeed, the familiars did take shape around Rally... three of them in 
fact.  Two of them appeared male in shape.  But when Rally notices the 
familiars, she sees that one of them was female - and that one happened 
to look at her.  For a few seconds, Rally wondered about this one... 
then recognized her.  &quot;Goldie?&quot; she gasped.  The shadowy figure nodded.  
 
It took an instant for Rally to realize what happened... and grinned at 
this realization.  For the longest time, Goldie had sought to bend Rally 
as her slave.  But now Goldie - or rather Goldie&#39;s soul - was now a 
slave to Rally.  &quot;Love the irony,&quot; she muttered with a smile, then 
returned her attention to Anderson.
 
To the priest, this manifestation of power from such a young vampire 
only frightened him, but he stood his ground.  &quot;This is not possible,&quot; 
he gasped.  &quot;She...she&#39;s only a fledging... and yet she has called up 
devils before her.&quot;  Then Anderson&#39;s brow furrowed at Rally as he spat 
angrily, &quot;Ah see... these apparitions are that of yer victims!  Ye &#39;ave 
become a true nosferatu, Rally Vincent... a filthy, murderin&#39; midian... 
an&#39; fer that, Ah canna let a corrupted devil like ye walk this earth!&quot;
 
&quot;We&#39;ll see about that,&quot; Rally smirked, then glanced at the familiars and 
said, &quot;Rip him apart.&quot;
 
The shadowy forms then charged at Anderson, who began to slash at the 
familiars with a fury of a person fighting the unholy.  But try as he 
might, whenever he cleft a familiar in two, it would simply heal as fast 
as it was cut.  Undeterred, Anderson continued to fight, his attention 
focused on the forms assailing him - until a sudden pain in his side got 
his attention.
 
Taking advantage of the demon attack, Rally had watched the battle, 
waiting for an opening - and found it, plunging the bayonet she was 
holding into Anderson&#39;s lower torso, gripping the blade handle with both 
hands.  Surprised, Anderson looked down to see Rally&#39;s eyes, irises gone 
and blazing a brilliant gold-red, his blood dripping on her hands.  
 
Furious, Anderson kicked Rally away, where she sprawled on the ground.  
Pulling the bayonet from his body, he looked at the vampire and said, 
&quot;Well now - it seems that I&#39;ve underestimated ye, hellspawn.  Enjoy your 
victory for now, because when we meet next time, Ah will be better 
prepared t&#39; face you!  Until then!&quot;  Then a flurry of Latin-inscribed 
parchments then flew around the priest, afterwhich both parchments - and 
priest - disappear from view.  The familiars that had for a few seconds 
did battle with Anderson, then faded and returned to Rally&#39;s body, which 
sat herself up from being kicked.  
 
Then the pain in her hands hit.  &quot;OH CRAP... CRAP... CRAP... CRAP!!!&quot; 
she groaned, holding her burned hands in front of her, lapping 
Anderson&#39;s spilled blood from them.  &quot;What the hell was I thinking 
holding that damn thing in the first place?&quot; 
 
Seras raced to her fledgling&#39;s side, helping Rally up on her feet.  &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe it,&quot; she said.  &quot;I have yet to summon familiars myself, 
and yet you&#39;ve been the first to do it.&quot;
 
&quot;That was because you have yet to kill humans so that you can enslave 
their souls, Seras,&quot; Alucard grinned.  &quot;It&#39;s as simple as it comes.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks a lot, Master,&quot; Seras growled sarcastically.  Still, she could 
only admire Rally&#39;s spirit in defeating Anderson.  &quot;You did do a good 
thing, Rally,&quot; she continued, turning back to Rally.  &quot;Unfortunately, 
there&#39;s still a lot for you to learn.  From what Master told me, this is 
the most elementary skill you can develop.&quot;
 
&quot;Nice to know, Master,&quot; Rally nodded.  &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I would 
like to go home now.&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Sir Integra added, somewhat glumly, &quot;we must return to Rally&#39;s 
house... for there are a lot of things we have to discuss about your 
future, Rally.&quot;  
 
&quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; Becky added, &quot;I&#39;d like to take Rally&#39;s car back.&quot;
 
&quot;Go ahead, Becky,&quot; Rally said, walking to the limo with May, Seras, 
Walter, and Sir Integra.  Alucard then faded from view, but it was 
determined that he went ahead.  &quot;There are some things I&#39;ve got to think 
about along the way.&quot;  May then guided Rally; her hands still burned but 
rapidly healing, into the limo, then followed her friend inside.
 
GOLDIE MUSO&#39;S HOUSE, AT THE SAME TIME...
 
Captain Kevin Delany could only shake his head as he, along with other 
C.P.D. officers stood guard as Federal agents swarmed about the house.  
Near the cordon close to ambulances, Goldie&#39;s wards sat on the ground, 
weeping openly upon receiving the news of their mistress&#39;s death.  
Delany could only look at the girls sympathetically but nothing more; 
they were currently under the jurisdiction of the Federal agents, who 
were questioning them.
 
After he showed his identification to the federal agents guarding the 
premises, Coleman walked over to Delany and asked, &quot;Hey Kevin, do you 
have any idea what&#39;s going on?&quot;  He of course knew the answer, but asked 
just as well.
 
&quot;You tell me, Roy,&quot; Delany mumbled.  &quot;We got an anonymous tip about 
trouble at this house, and by the time we arrived, it was swarming with 
feds.  From what I was able to gather, it seems that Goldie Muso&#39;s luck 
finally run out - she was found dead of gunshot wounds in the kitchen.  
Odd thing, though... the feds had to go in through the garage; the front 
door was blocked, and found a car shot-up badly.&quot;
 
&quot;I see,&quot; Coleman said, wondering how Rally was able to inflict so much 
damage.  He glanced over at the girls and asked, &quot;Did they see 
anything?&quot;
 
Delany glanced over and answered, &quot;Feds won&#39;t let us near them yet.  
They claim they have jurisdiction, due to their investigating Goldie in 
the first place.  Oh, here comes one of them.&quot;
 
A single agent walked over to the two detectives after interviewing the 
girls.  He then produced his identification and began with, &quot;Spencer 
Curtis, F.B.I..  We&#39;re done with the girls here, you can have them.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you, Agent Curtis,&quot; Roy replied, producing his I.D. as well.  
&quot;Did you get anything about what had happened from the girls?&quot;
 
&quot;Nothing much, except that they did know SOMEONE had broke in, but they 
don&#39;t have the foggiest about WHO.  Must be some residual effect from 
the Kerasine they were taking,&quot; Curtis said.
 
Inwardly, Coleman breathed a sigh of relief, thankful Rally was able to 
erase their memories of her visit.  &quot;Well, if there&#39;s anything we can do 
to help out, we&#39;d be glad to,&quot; he said.
 
&quot;Well I appreciate the help, Detective Coleman,&quot; Curtis began, &quot;but I 
believe we got it well in hand.  We&#39;ll make sure we&#39;ll give the Chicago 
P.D. a complete report on what had happened and...&quot;
 
Quite suddenly, the three were distracted when the girls began shrieking 
and crying out as Goldie&#39;s body was carted out on a gurney to a waiting 
ambulance.  The agents watching the girls had their hands full trying to 
restrain them.  Curtis could only shake his head as he returned his 
attention to Coleman and Delany.  &quot;We&#39;ll turn over the girls shortly.  
You... might want to place them on suicide watch until their systems 
clean themselves out from the Kerasine.&quot;
 
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Delany said.  &quot;I wish there was more we can do for you, Agent 
Curtis,&quot; he finished up, shaking Curtis&#39; hand.
 
&quot;Just being here is enough,&quot; the G-man replied.  &quot;Well, if you&#39;ll excuse 
me, I&#39;m be getting out of your way.&quot;  He then began his way to the 
ambulance, &quot;Again, I&#39;ll see that your department gets that report.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you, Agent,&quot; Delany answered back.  He then turned to Coleman and 
said, &quot;Roy, you look a little beat.  I&#39;ll take care of things here, you 
get yourself home.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks, Kevin.  There was some place I had to go first, then I&#39;ll head 
home,&quot; said Coleman.  He then turned back to his car.
 
Agent Curtis, in the meantime, had boarded the ambulance, then looked in 
the back and muttered, &quot;I really don&#39;t like this, lying to those 
detectives back there.&quot;  He looked at the individual in the back - 
Homeland Security Agent Harold Lewis - and added, &quot;What we saw in there 
didn&#39;t look like a terrorist attack.  And Goldie - she WAS shot but 
there was no blood pool.&quot; 
 
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you about it after we get back,&quot; Lewis said.  &quot;And don&#39;t 
worry about the detectives - Coleman knows the truth but he won&#39;t tell.&quot;
 
&quot;Comforting - but how are we going to tell the rest of the department,&quot; 
countered Curtis.
 
Lewis shrugged and added, &quot;We&#39;ll give the Chicago P.D. what they really 
need to know - but not everything.  As for Goldie, we&#39;ll do a quick 
autopsy, then burn the body.&quot;
 
&quot;You guys have it all planned,&quot; Curtis grumbled.
 
&quot;I guess.  Hey Spence?&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
Lewis thought carefully as the ambulance made its way out.  &quot;What&#39;s your 
view on... vampires?&quot;
 
RALLY AND MAY&#39;S HOUSE, SOME TIME LATER...
 
It took Coleman some time to get to Rally and May&#39;s home, where everyone 
was gathered in the living room.  The addition, as well as the faces of 
May and Becky, didn&#39;t help Rally&#39;s mood at all.  Looking at Sir Integra, 
who was talking in private with Alucard and Walter, the dark-haired 
vampire couldn&#39;t help but feel nervous.  She knew she was the object of 
their conversation - how to deal with a new vampire in the world.
 
&quot;Hey relax, Rally,&quot; May whispered, who was seated at the right side of 
Rally, &quot;I&#39;m certain they&#39;ll think of something.&quot;
 
&quot;I hope so, May,&quot; Rally answered, still not convinced.  
 
Sir Integra then took her seat, which was directly in front of Rally.  
Seeing her ice-blue eyes staring at her, Rally couldn&#39;t help but flinch.  
Sir Integra may have been her friend in the past - when she was human - 
but now Rally was a vampire, which made her the enemy of Sir Integra.  
&quot;Rally,&quot; she began, &quot;you must understand that this meeting is necessary.  
After all, you are the subject, whatever you like it or not.&quot;
 
&quot;I understand, Integra,&quot; Rally said, Seras taking the left side of her.  
&quot;Let&#39;s hear it then.&quot;
 
&quot;Alright then.&quot;  Sir Integra straightened herself before starting.  &quot;I 
am afraid there is no delicate way of saying this, Rally... you are a 
vampire now.  And being a vampire makes you a threat to this world and 
everyone on it.  But I realize that you deserve to hear what options you 
have available to you.&quot;  She then took a deep breath before continuing.  
&quot;Option one - if you wish, we could end your undead existence and allow 
you the rest you denied yourself for the sake of your friend.  Alucard 
could make it as painless as possible.&quot;
 
&quot;NOW WAIT A MINUTE...&quot; May began, horrified.
 
&quot;Don&#39;t interrupt, May,&quot; snapped Rally.  &quot;Sorry Integra, but I chose this 
existence and I&#39;m not about to chicken out on it as yet... although it 
does have some merit.&quot;
 
&quot;Understandable, which leads to my second option... if you wish, we 
could leave you as you are.  I have some contacts within the 
International Red Cross that could allow you with the blood you require 
for survival.  However,&quot; Sir Integra added, &quot;because you are a vampire 
now, this option may have to... shall I say... adapt your routine around 
you.&quot;
 
&quot;That might work.  Might be easier to capture bail jumpers at night,&quot; 
Rally mused.  &quot;But if someone were to scratch themselves, it might make 
it hard for me to resist turning them into a quick meal.&quot;
 
&quot;Not to mention it would be hard to explain why you have the gunshop 
open at night,&quot; Coleman added.
 
&quot;And there is yet another disadvantage,&quot; Sir Integra put in.  &quot;There is 
still the factor that Iscariot knows of your existence.  Mark my word, 
Rally, they will not rest until you are destroyed, if not Anderson, then 
their other assassins might seek you out... which would also put your 
friends in harm&#39;s way as a result.  I have had several of my men killed 
by Iscariot agents because they were in the way of their quests.&quot;
 
Rally took her time before answering, digesting this information.  &quot;From 
what you&#39;ve told me, Integra,&quot; she finally said, &quot;it looks like Goldie 
was only the tip of the iceberg.  Because of me, my friends are going to 
be in as much danger as I am.&quot;  She shook her head glumly as she 
concluded with, &quot;The only way this is going to work is that I have to 
become a hermit if no one is going to be hurt as a result.&quot;
 
&quot;But you have not heard my THIRD option yet, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra said, 
her eyes finally showing a softness in them.  &quot;You can come and work for 
me in London, with the Hellsing Organization.  You can be a valuable 
asset to me, with your gunsmithing skills complimenting Walter&#39;s... not 
to mention being protected from Iscariot.  Besides,&quot; she indicated 
Seras, who was looking at Rally - and Sir Integra - fondly, &quot;there is 
someone here that might want you come along.&quot;
 
&quot;Not to mention myself and Seras can help you hone your new skills to 
their eventual potential,&quot; Alucard added.  &quot;You are powerful, Rally 
Vincent, but in the terms of nosferatu you are still an infant - and 
still vulnerable to those annoying blessed weapons of Iscariot.  Come 
with us, and you&#39;ll become so invincible, those weapons will be as 
insignificant as a gnat.&quot;    
 
&quot;Not to mention you will learn how to control your thirst for blood with 
their help.  Those are my options, Rally,&quot; Sir Integra concluded.  &quot;What 
happens next depends on you.&quot;
 
It was several, uncomfortable moments of silence before May spoke up.  
&quot;Rally, does this mean... you&#39;ll be leaving Chicago?&quot;
 
Rally was quiet for a minute before answering.  &quot;You heard Integra, 
didn&#39;t you.  She&#39;s right... if I stay here, I&#39;ll end up putting you, Roy 
and Becky in danger... if not from Iscariot, but from me.  When I killed 
Goldie and those guards... when I felt their warm blood filling my 
mouth... I liked its taste.  And after I was through with her... all I 
could think of for a few seconds was wanting more of it.  I don&#39;t want 
to kill you, May... I really don&#39;t.&quot;  She sighed before continuing, 
&quot;There&#39;s a lot I need to know about being a vampire... about myself, so 
Integra... I&#39;ll go with you to London.&quot;
 
May started sobbing as she hugged Rally tightly.  Rally just stroked her 
hair as she said, &quot;Aw c&#39;mon, May.  It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to be gone 
forever.  I&#39;m certain Integra would allow me to visit now-and-then... 
right, Integra?&quot;
 
&quot;I will see to it that you are allowed ample time for occasional visits, 
provided you can control yourself,&quot; Sir Integra said, smiling.  &quot;But 
Rally, I must tell you this... I expect those who work under me to work 
as hard as possible, as well as conducting yourself in a professional 
manner.  So while you are on-duty with me, I am afraid informality when 
addressing me is out of the question.  Of course, off-duty is another 
manner.  Do I make myself clear, Rally?&quot;
 
&quot;You can count on me... Sir Integra,&quot; Rally answered with one of the 
biggest smiles ever.
 
Almost as once, Coleman, May and Becky embraced Rally, with Seras 
standing by smiling.  &quot;Becky,&quot; Rally asked, &quot;I was wondering if you can 
arrange gathering my things to ship to London?&quot;
