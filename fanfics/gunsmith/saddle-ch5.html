<a href="../gunsmith/saddle-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Rally entered the shop, expecting to find May ready to ream her out, 
but to her surprise the front room was empty. The door to the back 
room opened and May came out, looking tired, but smiling.

&quot;How did it go?&quot; she asked.

Rally&#146;s eyebrow lifted suspiciously. &quot;The scooter guy got the package 
alright. How is she?&quot; She pointed her chin towards the back room.

May&#146;s face became serious. &quot;I had to call Doc in - it was worse than 
it looked and she lost a lot of blood, but she&#146;ll be okay. At least it 
was a clean shot.&quot;

Rally nodded. &quot;Look, May, I&#146;m sorry&#133;.&quot;

May shook her head. &quot;I&#146;m sorry too. You were right before&#133;I was 
jealous.&quot;

The two women looked at each other for a long moment, then looked 
away.

&quot;I&#146;m not good at trusting people&#133;&quot; May said quickly.

&quot;Forget it. We both know what we&#146;re like.&quot; Rally looked at her feet. 
&quot;Maybe you&#146;re right about Cowboy. Maybe I do trust her more than I 
should.&quot;

The silence between them lengthened. The sound of something falling to 
the floor, followed by cursing, drew their attention away from the 
awkward pause. The two women entered the back room to find Cowboy on 
the floor, gripping her leg and regaling them with a string of 
colorful phrases. Together, May and Rally got the tall woman back on 
the cot. After Cowboy was settled and May had brought her over a glass 
of water and some painkillers, Cowboy looked up at them ruefully. 

&quot;I owe you both, I guess. Thanks.&quot;

Rally shook her head and crossed her arms firmly. &quot;That&#146;s not enough 
Cowboy. You owe us more than a little half-assed thanks and no 
explanation. Why are the City Planning Department flunkies trying to 
shoot you down&#133;and what the hell was in that package?&quot;

Cowboy stared off, her brow furrowed. May joined Rally, her arms 
akimbo. &quot;I think you owe us at least that, don&#146;t you? We don&#146;t care if 
you&#146;re with the bad guys, but we need to know what you&#146;ve dragged us 
into.&quot;

Rally nodded, &quot;And you need to know that if you are one of the bad 
guys, I&#146;ll take you down, Cowboy, no hard feelings.&quot;

That seemed to pull the woman out of her reverie and she laughed, 
loudly and long. &quot;Well, at least I can reassure you Rall, and you too 
May,&quot; she nodded at the smaller woman, &quot;you won&#146;t have to take me 
down.&quot;

Rally felt herself relax a little. &quot;Then tell us what this is about 
and maybe we can help.&quot;

&quot;Have a seat then, ladies.&quot; Cowboy gestured towards the table. Rally 
and May grabbed chairs while Cowboy tossed back the pills and sipped 
from her water glass.

&quot;Wish I had something stronger than this&#133;&quot; she said wistfully. &quot;OK, 
this story starts a few years back. I was wandering around, doing some 
small-time delivery work, you know the kind?&quot; She glanced at her 
audience, who nodded. &quot;I&#146;m a drifter, but I&#146;m not stupid, you know. I 
always stayed on the outside, good freelance, that&#146;s all. I&#146;m tall, 
but I don&#146;t stand out in a crowd and that&#146;s good for a delivery 
person.

&quot;Every time an area got too hot for me, I just moved on until I ended 
up here. I was working for a local guy, small potato stuff, when I got 
an offer. Free rent, some small jobs and pocket cash. It sounded 
perfect, so I took &#145;em up on it.

&quot;A few months later, I was told to move, that a new place would be 
found for me. Unfortunately, like I said, I&#146;m not stupid. I began to 
notice a few things. Every time I made a delivery the papers the next 
day pointed out a high profile murder. After I was moved the second 
time, I noticed that the place I lived was &quot;vacated&quot; shortly after. I 
got a bit suspicious, which is a bad thing to do in my business. When 
I put two and two together, I didn&#146;t like what I saw. Property owners 
that might have gotten in the way of vacating my block were dying 
mysteriously. After one was killed, the others usually fell in line, 
but sometimes I made a second delivery&#133;and the troublemaker went away.

&quot;It started to bug me, so I &quot;borrowed&quot; one of my packages, and took a 
look inside. You&#146;re not gonna believe what I found&#133;&quot; Cowboy rubbed the 
back of her head.

&quot;Try us,&quot; Rally said evenly.

&quot;You saw the wound on my leg, right?&quot; Cowboy asked the women. &quot;What 
gun made it d&#146;you think?&quot;

Rally answered unhesitatingly. &quot;Ruger Super Redhawk, .44 Magnum ammo.&quot;

Cowboy nodded, &quot;You&#146;d think so, wouldn&#146;t you?&quot;

Rally frowned. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Cowboy closed her eyes. &quot;What would you say if I told you it was a 
Lone Eagle did it?&quot;

Rally shook her head. &quot;I&#146;d tell you you were wrong. The Lone Eagle is 
a target pistol - hunting, maybe. I&#146;d figure you knew that.&quot;

&quot;I do. And I&#146;m telling you it was a Lone Eagle, or, I should say, it 
was made to look like a Lone Eagle. But it doesn&#146;t pack wadcutters.&quot; 
She grimaced.

May slapped her hands on the table. &quot;I&#146;m sorry to interrupt this 
mutual gun-gasm thing, but can you run that by me in language a stupid 
explosives expert can understand?&quot;

Rally glanced towards her partner. &quot;When the Lone Eagle is used for 
target shooting the bullets aren&#146;t tapered, so they make a clean hole 
in the target.&quot;

May nodded. &quot;Gotcha. Please continue.&quot; She nodded towards Cowboy.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Rally said. &quot;You said it was &#145;made to look like a&#146; Lone Eagle 
- what does that mean?&quot;

&quot;I mean,&quot; Cowboy said, her brows drawn together, &quot;that the gun that 
put this hole in my leg is made of compressed paper. After the job is 
done, it can be lit with a match and destroyed. They&#146;ve got a bunch of 
styles. They chamber real ammo, and then, poof, they&#146;re gone. No 
weapon, no evidence.&quot;

Rally and May stared, mouths open.

&quot;You *are* joking, right?&quot; May asked. &quot;&#146;Cause that doesn&#146;t make any 
sense.&quot;

Cowboy shook her head and yawned. &quot;I&#146;m not joking. The guys that tried 
to hit me - no weapon, right?&quot; Rally nodded. &quot;This one too. You saw 
the scorch marks on my carpet? That was a nice little touch from my 
friends letting me know that I&#146;m not welcome back there.&quot;

&quot;Then what was in the package I delivered to your friend? One of these 
guns?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Cowboy yawned again. &quot;Sorry. No - nothing that good. It was a 
sample of the paper used, and a copy of the formula. My friend on the 
scooter is a contact for a journalist at the Tribune. She&#146;s got a 
story on these hits and I wanted her know what was up.&quot;

&quot;Is she in any danger?&quot; May wanted to know.

&quot;Probably, but she&#146;s a crime reporter - she&#146;s usually in danger. 
Mostly does governmental corruption stuff.&quot; Cowboy grinned. &quot;She&#146;s a 
hell of a crack shot herself, Rall. You&#146;d probably like her.&quot; The tall 
woman leaned back with a groan and another yawn.&quot; Sorry - these 
painkillers, y&#146;know?&quot;

&quot;One more thing before you sleep.&quot; Rally insisted. &quot;What&#146;s the 
connection between the vacations and the guns? And why did you say the 
delivery was a matter of life or death?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#146;t I make that clear?&quot; Cowboy asked. &quot;The big boss man I work 
for, Long - you&#146;ve heard of him probably.&quot;

Rally nodded. &quot;Oh sure. Small-time drugs, protection. I&#146;ve picked up a 
few of his stupider or more careless people.&quot;

Cowboy grinned. &quot;I heard about that. Anyway, Long was always little 
until recently. Seems he&#146;s recently become really good friends with 
one Paul J. Keaton.&quot;

&quot;The Deputy Commissioner of Planning and Development?&quot; May asked.

&quot;You bet, little lady.&quot; Cowboy yawned hugely. &quot;And there&#146;s a nice 
little business owner that isn&#146;t happy about a vacation of the lot 
adjacent to his. I made a drop-off yesterday. My friend wants to run 
the scoop tonight, tomorrow latest. After you dropped off that package 
an anonymous call went out to the guy who&#146;s bitchin&#146; the loudest about 
the vacation. With luck he&#146;s flying into Acapulco or somewhere far 
away for a vacation, right about now.&quot; She looked up, catching Rally&#146;s 
eye. &quot;I&#146;m tired of this little deal, you know. I don&#146;t want any more 
deaths because of me. Losers and druggies I can&#146;t feel bad for, but 
these guys are just trying to get by honestly.&quot; Her eyes closed. &quot;I&#146;m 
not helpin&#146; them anymore,&quot; she finished sleepily.

May and Rally got up from their chairs.

&quot;Sleep it off, Cowboy. Tomorrow Doc&#146;ll come back and take a look the 
leg.&quot; May shot a look at Rally, and walked to the door. &quot;I&#146;ll watch 
the shop.&quot; Without turning, May stepped into the front and closed the 
door behind her.

&quot;C&#146;mere,&quot; Cowboy waved Rally over. &quot;I&#146;m really sorry about draggin&#146; 
you into this Rall. And your friend too - she&#146;s a cute kid. What is 
she, fourteen?&quot;

&quot;Eighteen.&quot;

Cowboy looked surprised. &quot;No kidding. Hunh. Just goes to show you how 
wrong I can be.&quot; She took Rally&#146;s hand in her own and gave it a 
squeeze. &quot;I just wanted to thank you again.&quot; Pulling a little on 
Rally&#146;s arm, she closed the distance between them and gave Rally a 
quick kiss on the cheek.

Rally pulled back as if bitten, taking her hand from Cowboy&#146;s and 
clenching it at her side. &quot;Uh, look, Cowboy&#133;I&#146;m not, that is&#133;I&#146;m not 
interested in you like that.&quot;

Cowboy lay back again and grinned lopsidedly at Rally. &quot;I know. You 
just love me for my gun - and my bike.&quot;

Rally laughed a little nervously and agreed. &quot;G&#146;night Cowboy.&quot;

A muffled sound that might have been a snore or an answer emanated 
from the woman on the cot. Rally stood for a while, looking down at 
the recumbent figure, then quietly left the room.

As the door closed, the &quot;sleeping&quot; figure smiled. &quot;Yeah&#133;and my Mama&#146;s 
a rattlesnake.&quot;

***

May looked over her shoulder as Rally joined her at the front desk. 
&quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;I think she&#146;s telling the truth.&quot; Rally grabbed the gun polish and 
began working on her Grendel.

&quot;You would.&quot; May sighed. &quot;Has anyone ever told you, Rally Vincent, 
that you are a complete softy?&quot;

&quot;Am not.&quot;

&quot;Are too.&quot; May stuck her tongue out and laughed. &quot;You really are! How 
many damsels in distress are you going to save before you admit it?&quot;

&quot;Damsels in distress?&quot; Rally looked puzzled.

May made a face. &quot;Forget it.&quot; Looking around, she started to untie her 
apron. &quot;Do you mind much if I take the rest of the day off? I have to 
see a man about a horse.&quot;

Rally looked completely confused. &quot;What?&quot;

May laughed gaily. &quot;Nothing! I just wanted to give you some time alone 
with your new girlfriend.&quot;

Rally stood, her face darkening. &quot;That&#146;s not funny.&quot;

May watched her in silence, until Rally sat back down, muttering under 
her breath. &quot;Say what you like. In this field I think I have a bit 
more experience than you do.&quot;

&quot;Fine, Miss Expert. You have the rest of the day off. The evening too, 
if you want.&quot; Rally wouldn&#146;t look up as May slipped into the backroom 
and came out carrying her jacket.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry. I shouldn&#146;t tease you.&quot; May looked only a little contrite.

&quot;Is there something about her that seems particularly untrustworthy?&quot;

&quot;No, not really. She&#146;s nice. But I think she&#146;s going to hurt you - one 
way or another.&quot;

In the ensuing silence, May turned and left the shop.
