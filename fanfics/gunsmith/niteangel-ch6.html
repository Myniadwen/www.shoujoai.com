THE HELLSING MANSION, LATE AFTERNOON...

The black Rolls-Royce made a graceful circle in front of the huge house, 
then came to a stop near the entrance. Exiting the Rolls, Berttle, 
Australian member of the Wild Geese and supervisor of the motor pool, 
made his way to the driver&#39;s side rear door and opened it. &quot;There we 
are, love. I&#39;ll get your bags.&quot;

Looking around as she exited, Misty Brown stood in awe as she surveyed 
the huge mansion. &quot;Gosh,&quot; she breathed, taking in the incredible sight, 
&quot;so this is where Rally lives now.&quot;

&quot;That she does, love,&quot; Berttle replied, overhearing. &quot;Well... not in the 
main rooms, but in the sub-basement level... if you catch my meaning.&quot; 
Misty nodded as the Australian got her suitcases from the boot of the 
Rolls. &quot;Anyway, why don&#39;t we get you settled in, love. I&#39;m certain the 
lady would want to talk to you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand one thing,&quot; said Misty. &quot;I said I could get my own 
hotel room. Why did Sir Integra insist that I stay here?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Berttle began, &quot;the lady thought, since you were Sir Integra&#39;s 
friend, she figured that you deserved better, so she decided to take you 
in, love.&quot;

&quot;Well &#39;allo there, Miss,&quot; another voice called out. Both Misty and 
Berttle turned to see Pip Bernadotte, leader of the Wild Geese, stroll 
towards them. &quot;Okay Berttle, I&#39;ll take zese from here. You get yourself 
to ze motor pool and make sure ze transports are in good shape in case 
we have to roll-out tonight.&quot;

&quot;Are you certain, Captain?&quot; Berttle questioned, noticing the bandaged 
condition of his commander. &quot;You&#39;re still a little banged-up from two 
days ago.&quot;

&quot;A good soldier never gives up, no matter how many injuries he has,&quot; Pip 
countered, moving to Misty&#39;s baggage. &quot;Now Mademoiselle, if you would 
allow me, I will take zese bags to your room and...&quot; But the minute he 
want to lift the bags, Pip&#39;s face contorted into a very painful grimace, 
then abruptly set down the bags, staggered to the Rolls and leaned on 
it. &quot;MERDE!&quot; he gasped, &quot;MY... MY RIBS...&quot;, grasping his injured ribs.

&quot;Well, your subordinate DID warn you about your condition before you 
made the attempt, so I should not complain about the results,&quot; Walter C. 
Dolnez commented dryly, appearing next to Pip. &quot;I suggest you get 
yourself to your room and continue to rest for the next few days. You 
would do Sir Integra no good in your current state.&quot; Pip didn&#39;t 
complain, just nodding as he struggled to get up.

Misty just looked at all this and asked, &quot;Excuse me... but what exactly 
happened to him?&quot;

&quot;Oh, just the result of a mission gone wrong, Miss Brown,&quot; Walter 
dismissed. &quot;I would not worry too much about him, though. He&#39;ll be 
alright... provided he continues to rest.&quot; Motioning to several of the 
household staff, he made instructions to have Misty&#39;s bags taken 
upstairs. &quot;Now if you will follow me, I believe Sir Integra would like 
you to join her for High Tea.&quot;

Misty brightened. &quot;Really? I just might do that!&quot; Following the old 
butler, the former catburglar made her way inside the mansion, taking in 
the d&eacute;cor of the place.

After a few minutes of going through the hallways, the two came to a 
drawing room, where Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing was seated 
at a table, some of the staff setting out sandwiches and pastries, with 
a pot of Earl Gray tea steaming in the center. &quot;Well, nice to see you, 
Miss Brown. I am sorry that Rally cannot be present for this, she is 
currently on assignment and should return shortly,&quot; she began, &quot;Please, 
be seated. I am certain you have many questions that need answering.&quot; 
Misty nodded, then sat herself down. &quot;Thank you, Walter. That will be 
all for now.&quot; Walter bowed slightly, then made his way out.

Misty simply watched as Walter left, then turned her attention back to 
Sir Integra. The Hellsing leader had poured herself a cup of tea and was 
preparing to pour one for her guest. &quot;I must admit,&quot; Sir Integra began, 
&quot;we were caught a little off-guard about your arrival. Please forgive me 
if we seem a little rushed.&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#39;m not worried,&quot; Misty said, smiling. &quot;In fact, I&#39;m a little 
honored that you were able to fit me in so soon.&quot;

&quot;I am glad about it,&quot; Sir Integra said. &quot;However, there are a few things 
I need to know first.&quot; She then took a breath and continued, &quot;Are you 
aware about Rally Vincent&#39;s current circumstances?&quot;

&quot;I know that Rally&#39;s a vampire now,&quot; Misty said plainly. &quot;May, Becky and 
Roy told me what had happened to her... and what she did to Goldie.&quot;

&quot;Rally said you never mentioned that you already knew of that fact in 
your letter to her,&quot; Sir Integra inquired, a little surprised about her 
candor.

&quot;Well... I thought it was something one shouldn&#39;t place in the public 
mails,&quot; Misty explained. &quot;I mean... you don&#39;t really know who or what 
might be reading you mail these days.&quot;

Sir Integra nodded. &quot;Understandable.&quot;

&quot;By the way,&quot; Misty added, &quot;I noticed that there were several weak areas 
in your mansion&#39;s security and thought I should bring it up to you.&quot; She 
straightened up and added, &quot;I used to be a catburgler. When I was 
looking for a score during those days, I usually look for weaknesses in 
security to exploit while I cased the place I was going to hit. 
Nowadays, I&#39;m working for a security company now, and often used my 
skills from my former job to look for weaknesses, using a criminal&#39;s 
point-of-view.&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Sir Integra said. &quot;If you will give me a list of these 
deficiencies, I will submit them to Walter so that they can be 
addressed.&quot;

&quot;But I haven&#39;t came all this way just to give you a security 
assessment,&quot; said Misty, sounding more serious. &quot;I just want to know 
whatever would cause Rally to choose becoming a vampire in the first 
place.&quot;

&quot;Why indeed, Miss Brown,&quot; Alucard&#39;s voice came out of nowhere. Both 
Misty and Sir Integra had startled looks as the No-Life King walked 
through the wall towards them. &quot;That is a very interesting question you 
pose.&quot;

Misty nearly jumped out of her seat, her eyes wide seeing Alucard making 
such an entrance. As for Sir Integra, she did get out of her seat &#150; only 
she was red-faced with anger. &quot;DAMN IT ALL, ALUCARD!!!&quot; she yelled. &quot;I 
WARNED YOU ABOUT FRIGHTNING OUR GUEST!!!&quot;

&quot;Then how do you wish I would make my entrance, Master?&quot; Alucard suavely 
said. &quot;Certainly she had expected something more out of the ordinary 
from it.&quot;

&quot;But not to the point of scaring her!&quot; the Hellsing leader shot back.

&quot;Sir Integra... it&#39;s alright!&quot; Misty called out, defusing the hostility. 
&quot;Granted, I wasn&#39;t expecting... such an entrance, but I figured 
something like this might happen.&quot; Turning to the No-Life King, she then 
said, &quot;Mr. Alucard, I appreciate you for coming. My guess is that you, 
along with Sir Integra, are familiar with what had happened to Rally... 
and why she became a vampire.&quot;

&quot;Indeed I am, as well as my master,&quot; said Alucard, losing his arrogant 
attitude and sitting down. &quot;Miss Brown, you have to know that your 
friend Rally Vincent did not take embracing the night lightly. If she 
could have, she would&#39;ve wished to die as a human, but the circumstances 
did not allow that. She only became a vampire so that she would be able 
to save her friend May from an unfortunate fate. And please, there&#39;s no 
need to refer to me as &#39;Mr. Alucard&#39;. Just my name is enough.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough... I guess,&quot; Misty added. &quot;Well, as long as you can call me 
&#39;Misty&#39;, I&#39;ll listen to what you say.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you,&quot; Alucard answered, bowing his head while taking off his 
hat and glasses. He then looked to Sir Integra and added, &quot;Now, if I can 
have a serving of this fine tea, I believe we can have our discussion.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Sir Integra said, still unsure if having her servant vampire 
present was a good idea. He WAS behaving like a gentleman... but she 
wondered how long it was going to last.

AN UPSTAIRS ROOM AT ARISUWAGA&#39;S LOCKET, AT THE SAME TIME...

A portable alarm clock beeped incessantly as two woman, both of them 
naked and asleep, laid on a bed, various sex toys strewn on the floor. 
No longer human, Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent awoke as many vampires do &#150; 
rapidly and without hesitation. Leaning over, she switched-off the 
clock, then stretched out. Finally relaxing, she looked next to her, and 
smiled as she saw her master, Seras Victoria, still asleep.

A wicked smile came over Rally&#39;s face as she carefully worked her right 
hand into the covers under the two vampires&#39; bodies &#150; specifically, near 
Seras. She didn&#39;t want to alert her master &#150; she knew firsthand that 
vampires were ever alert, even when asleep. Quietly, Rally worked her 
dusky hand until she found her target &#150; the crotch of her master.

Her efforts were rewarded when she heard Seras gasp with surprise, 
Rally&#39;s fingers quickly slipping between the slit of the Draculina&#39;s 
sex... and the gradually hardening knob of Seras&#39; clitoris. &quot;Uhh... 
Rally,&quot; she gasped, her fledgling&#39;s fingers working their magic, &quot;we 
really... oh... don&#39;t... OHHH!!!&quot;

&quot;Have the time?&quot; Rally smirked, licking and sucking the nipple of one of 
Seras&#39; large breasts. &quot;I think we can make the time... Master.&quot; Quickly, 
she made her manipulations, Seras writhing in pleasure. Thirty seconds 
later, she was rewarded upon seeing her master&#39;s quaking release, Seras 
nearly passing out from her orgasm.

Now Seras laid on the bed, panting from her pleasure. Glancing sideways, 
she smiled as she said, &quot;That was a bit underhanded, you know that, 
Rally?&quot;

&quot;Maybe, Master,&quot; added Rally slyly, slowly licking her master&#39;s vaginal 
secretions from her fingers before kissing her master&#39;s lips deeply, 
&quot;but it felt good... didn&#39;t it?&quot;

The Draculina nodded, reveling in the taste of her sex on Rally&#39;s lips. 
&quot;Not exactly the most original way to wake someone up... but it is the 
most fun way.&quot;

&quot;Sure is.&quot; Rally looked at the alarm clock and further said, &quot;We better 
hurry... gotta leave this place in time to catch the tide.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Seras said, getting up. &quot;We better save time by showering 
together.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s the right idea?&quot; the dusky vampire asked. &quot;You know 
whenever we do that, we tend to get a little...&quot; she smiled as she 
added, &quot;playful and lose track of time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the risk we have to take,&quot; Seras answered, smiling. &quot;You got a 
better idea?&quot; Rally shook her head.

The two vampires did shower together... and like Rally predicted, she 
and Seras did indulge in brief &#150; but rewarding sex play while doing so. 
However, the two kept note on the time and managed to finish their 
shower before they got too involved in their passions.

Fifteen minutes later, both of them had dried themselves off and gotten 
dressed. Seras had finished putting on the white stockings that were 
part of her yellow uniform and was about to strap on her boots when a 
knocking came from the door. Rally, about to put on her leather jacket, 
got up from the bed to answer the door... and was a little startled with 
who was on the other side.

Standing at the door, a small cart with a covered tray with her, was 
what appeared to by a 10 year-old girl with pink eyes and hair of 
brilliant electric blue tied in two ponytails. But the thing that 
confused Rally was the creature on top of the girl&#39;s head. Quadrapedal, 
the small animal had brown fur resembling a cat&#39;s, but with long ears 
and a powder-puff tail of a rabbit. Rally was hard-pressed in trying to 
figure out if this was a stuffed doll or a live creature. It turned out 
to be the latter when the creature looked up with her yellow eyes and 
said, &quot;Meow?&quot;

&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; the girl said with a smile. &quot;Juri was wondering if you 
and your girlfriend would come down and do a little favor for her?&quot;

&quot;Uh... just a minute, Miss...&quot; Rally started. &quot;Excuse me... but... who 
exactly are you?&quot;

&quot;Oh my name is Sasami,&quot; the girl said, &quot;and this is Ryo-Ohki,&quot; 
indicating the animal.

&quot;Meow,&quot; Ryo-Ohki added, cocking her head and smiling.

&quot;Uh... okay, let me ask my master. I&#39;ll get back to you,&quot; Rally 
answered, still staring at the cabbit. Sasami simply smiled.

Walking over to Seras, who had finished putting on her boots, Rally bent 
over and said, &quot;Master, it seems our host has a favor for us and wants 
us to come down for it.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see anything wrong about it, Rally,&quot; the Draculina shrugged. 
&quot;Sure. But I&#39;m certain we&#39;ll still have plenty of time to cross the 
Thames.&quot;

&quot;I just want to be able to talk to Misty,&quot; Rally explained. &quot;Speaking of 
which,&quot; she returned to Sasami. &quot;Excuse me, but about my human 
counterpart and her Misty...&quot;

&quot;Oh they left this morning,&quot; Sasami answered. &quot;I guess the other Rally 
wanted to tell her friends about her engagement.&quot; She then wheeled the 
cart inside the room. &quot;Here, Juri thought you girls should have some 
refreshments before you leave.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Rally said, taking the cart from Sasami, &quot;we&#39;ll be down soon.&quot;

As soon as the door closed, Sasami made her way to the stairs. Standing 
at the landing, though, stood a busty brown-haired girl in a red maid&#39;s 
uniform. &quot;They should be down in a little bit, May,&quot; she told the 
cyberdoll. &quot;After that, you&#39;ll be able to clean their room.&quot;

&quot;Nice to know. Thank you, Sasami,&quot; May said cheerfully. After Sasami and 
Ryo-Ohki had left, she looked towards the room and said to herself, &quot;I 
wonder if they made a mess of the room like the others did. It&#39;s a good 
thing I&#39;m doing the cleanup and not Mahoro, otherwise she would&#39;ve 
thrown away the sex toys. She&#39;s good, and very tolerant... but a bit too 
pure-hearted for cleaning all these rooms.&quot;

Back inside the room, Rally lifted the lid on the cart, revealing two 
glasses of blood. &quot;I wonder if they got some dumb-waiter system to this 
level,&quot; she said, handing one glass to Seras. &quot;It would be pretty 
awkward for that little girl trying to carry this tray with these 
glasses.&quot;

&quot;Not to mention messy if you happen to drop it,&quot; Seras added, accepting 
the glass, with Rally nodding in agreement.

The two were silent as they consumed their blood. Then Rally broke the 
silence, &quot;Master... I was wondering about that little trick you used on 
me when you left me alone with Misty...&quot;

&quot;Just a method of discipline that Master had taught me after he freed 
me,&quot; the Draculina said. &quot;It&#39;s only effective as long as we&#39;re bonded.&quot; 
She paused before continuing, &quot;I&#39;m sorry about using it, Rally. I&#39;ll try 
to avoid using it in the future, but I cannot promise I&#39;ll never use it 
again. And one of the times it may happen,&quot; she sighed, &quot;it could be 
painful. Believe me... I know how it could feel.&quot;

Rally sided over to Seras and gave her a small peck on the cheek. &quot;I 
understand,&quot; she said in a low, kind voice. &quot;I&#39;m still new at this 
vampire thing... and if I get out-of-line, then I guess I deserve it.&quot; 
She then polished off her blood, then finished with, &quot;We better get 
going. I like to know what this favor Juri wants from us.&quot;

Seras also got up, placing her empty glass on the cart tray along with 
Rally&#39;s. &quot;I think you&#39;re impatient to see Misty,&quot; she quipped.

&quot;That too, Master,&quot; Rally chuckled.

Five minutes later, both Rally and Seras wondered WHY in the world they 
accepted Juri&#39;s invitation for her favor. The main reason was that both 
of them were sitting next to each other &#150; and they both had a similar 
device on their heads, a small yellow ball with feet and blinking eyes! 
&quot;I feel stupid,&quot; Rally grumbled, her face betraying a sour look.

&quot;Agreed. This is bloody ridiculous,&quot; growled Seras. &quot;How much longer do 
we have to have these silly things on our heads?&quot;

&quot;Patience, patience, you two,&quot; a somewhat lively voice admonished. 
&quot;Genius like mine shouldn&#39;t be hurried, after all.&quot; The source of the 
voice was what appeared to be a young girl that had long crablike bright 
red hair. She seemed to be working on what looked like a keyboard, but 
it looked like two transparent black panels. The girl looked up at the 
two vampires, her emerald green eyes twinkling and added, &quot;Who knows... 
maybe after I&#39;m done, I&#39;ll give you two a lollypop!&quot; Both Rally and 
Seras groaned aloud.

&quot;Provided you can find some that are blood-flavored, Washu,&quot; Juri 
Arisugawa commented wryly, standing at the bar along with Ryoko Hakubi, 
Minagi, and Sasami. And they were not alone &#150; Juri&#39;s newlywed wife 
Setsuna Meiou was also there, along with Haruka Tenoh and her lover 
Michiru Kaioh.

Some of the other employees of Arisugawa&#39;s Locket were there as well: 
Ramna Saotome, Hitomi Kanzaki, Hyatt, as well as Hyatt&#39;s lover Excel 
Excel, and Keiko Sonoda &#150; who was awaiting May&#39;s return, all stood in 
front of the two vampires. &quot;Wow,&quot; Excel commented, her eyes wide, &quot;you 
weren&#39;t kidding, Ha-chan! Other than the eyes, that vampire Rally is 
just like the other one!&quot; Hyatt just nodded wearily, limply sagging next 
to Excel.

&quot;I&#39;m blown away by the similarities as well,&quot; Haruka added, just as 
amazed. Michiru nodded as well.

&quot;I&#39;m just grateful you were able to prevent any trouble, Juri,&quot; Setsuna 
said, leaning next to Juri. &quot;I knew there was the risk of alike versions 
running into each other, but I never thought it would be vampires!&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;re just grateful I wasn&#39;t hurt in the whole thing, love,&quot; 
Juri commented, caressing Setsuna&#39;s cheek. Looking over to Washu Hakubi, 
who was still working at her holographic desktop, she added, &quot;How much 
longer?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know,&quot; Rally growled. &quot;I look ridiculous having 
this yellow ball on my head!&quot;

&quot;Just a minute, I&#39;m getting the final readings... now!&quot; Washu then made 
a few more calculations, then opened up a small black hole in front of 
Juri. &quot;Okay, Juri,&quot; she said, &quot;now stick you hand into that portal and 
get it.&quot;

Looking dubiously at the hole, Juri complied. After a few seconds of 
poking through it, she withdrew her hand, in it a device which looked 
like a cellphone. &quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I&#39;ll explain as soon as I clean-up here,&quot; Washu muttered, then pressed 
a button which caused the devices on Rally and Seras&#39; heads to 
disappear. The two vampires then felt the tops of their heads and were 
surprised that they were gone. &quot;Thanks for your co-operation, girls,&quot; 
the emerald-eyed genius said.

&quot;Grateful... I think,&quot; Seras said, still amazed that the embarrassing 
devices were gone.

&quot;Nice to know,&quot; quipped Washu, then turned to face Juri. &quot;Okay, now 
about that device, take a closer look at it.&quot; Juri did, then showed 
everyone an image of the Hellsing Coat of Arms on the flip-lid of the 
device. &quot;To answer what questions you may be thinking of, yes that&#39;s a 
cellphone. However, that&#39;s a very special cellphone, which will direct 
calls to these two&#39;s,&quot; thumbing to Rally and Seras, &quot;home dimension... 
and ONLY to the Hellsing Organization itself!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s nice to know,&quot; Rally added, &quot;but why would you want to make such 
a device in the first place?&quot;

&quot;To fulfill a promise I made last night,&quot; Juri said, stepping forward. 
&quot;When I was talking to Sir Integra, I found out from her about the 
problems you were having with a very specific microchip and the effects 
it causes.&quot;

&quot;Yes, the FREAK chip,&quot; Seras put in.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Juri agreed. &quot;Since this place has now appeared in your 
dimension, there stands a good chance whoever or whatever is creating 
this chip may try to use this place to distribute it from here. Last 
night, I asked Ryoko if she could ask her mother,&quot; pointing to Washu, 
&quot;if she could find a way to contact her if we find someone trying to 
push that chip here. Now that I do, I will be able to make the contact 
if that sort of thing occurs.&quot;

&quot;That sounds like a good idea,&quot; said Rally. Then remembering a bit of 
what Juri said, she made a double-take at Washu and gasped, &quot;Hey wait a 
minute &#150; she Ryoko&#39;s mother? She looks to me she&#39;s twelve!&quot;

Sasami giggled, then said, &quot;Washu&#39;s much older than she appears... and 
she&#39;s not the only one!&quot; The little girl&#39;s form then shimmered, then 
morphed into her Tsunami form, startling the vampires, and added as she 
leaned closer to Minagi, &quot;We all have our little secrets, Rally 
Vincent,&quot; her voice sounding more mature. &quot;I know this sounds 
incredible, but we all learned that our differences could help us all&quot; 
She pointed out Hitomi and added further, &quot;It was because of her 
extrasensory abilities that we were able to determine that you and your 
master were not a threat to us, and that maybe one day you could 
possibly be an ally to us.&quot;

&quot;So I wouldn&#39;t sweat it,&quot; Haruka said. &quot;You&#39;re just a unique part of 
this place, just like any of the girls that comes to have a good time.&quot;

Rally and Seras smiled. &quot;We&#39;re glad to hear that,&quot; the Draculina finally 
said. &quot;And I hope maybe you can be a help to the Hellsing Organization 
when we need it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m certain we can,&quot; Setsuna said.

&quot;Juri,&quot; Rally added, &quot;Washu said that you can use that cellphone to 
contact Integra about the FREAK chip. I was wondering if you can use it 
to contact Hellsing for other purposes?&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot; Juri asked.

&quot;Well... it&#39;s concerning my human counterpart and her Misty,&quot; said 
Rally. &quot;I was wondering... when they set a date for their wedding, if 
you can use it to let us know if we&#39;re invited to it?&quot;

Juri shrugged. &quot;Why not? It&#39;s not like I can use it ONLY for the 
instance of the FREAK chip. And I supposed I can let you know about 
other events over here.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s nice,&quot; Seras said. &quot;Well, if you won&#39;t be needing us further, I 
think me and my fledgling will be taking our leave of you.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; added Rally, &quot;my Misty should be at the Hellsing mansion by now 
and I&#39;m looking forward to meeting her.&quot;

&quot;Then I won&#39;t be keeping you from your obligations,&quot; Juri said. &quot;Rally, 
you and Seras are more than welcome to come back here when your duties 
allow.&quot;

&quot;I think we will, won&#39;t we Master?&quot; Rally ask.

Seras nodded, picking up her&#39;s and Rally&#39;s overnight bag. &quot;Why not? This 
is a good place, and all of you are very fascinating. Me and Rally would 
be honored to return.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that,&quot; Juri added. &quot;We would love to see you back. Who 
knows &#150; maybe Seras, you might meet YOUR counterpart here!&quot;

&quot;Thanks... but I think Rally&#39;s is enough for us,&quot; the Draculina laughed 
humorlessly as she and Rally waved goodbye.

The two soon found themselves outside. The sun was up, so Rally placed 
her special sunglasses on. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t blame you for not wishing to see 
your counterpart, Master,&quot; she said, placing the bag in the trunk. &quot;From 
what I&#39;ve heard, she and her Sir Integra have more of an active 
relationship that you and our Integra.&quot;

&quot;Personally, I wouldn&#39;t concern yourself with my personal life,&quot; Seras 
said, the two entering the Cobra, &quot;but I do appreciate your feelings 
nonetheless.&quot;

&quot;Well, enough about the future right now,&quot; Rally added as she hit the 
speed dial on her cellphone, &quot;let&#39;s focus on the present right now.&quot;

The phone rang twice before it picked up. &quot;Hellsing residence,&quot; the 
voice of Walter said, &quot;how can I help you?&quot;

&quot;Walter, It&#39;s Rally,&quot; the dusky vampire began. &quot;Me and Master have left 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket and are about to start heading home. Do you know if 
Misty arrived yet?&quot;

&quot;Why yes, she arrived over an hour ago,&quot; the old butler said. &quot;She, 
along with Sir Integra, are talking to Alucard while we&#39;re...&quot;

&quot;WHAT!?!? ALUCARD&#39;S WITH MISTY!?!?&quot; Rally yelled. Throwing the cellphone 
to Seras, she gunned the Cobra&#39;s engine as she tore away.

&quot;Miss Vincent? Is there something wrong?&quot; Walter&#39;s voice called out from 
the cellphone.

&quot;We&#39;ll get back to you later, Walter,&quot; Seras replied. She then switched 
off the phone, then shook Rally&#39;s shoulder. &quot;What are you doing? Slow 
down!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to let that creep Alucard frighten Misty,&quot; Rally growled 
through her teeth. Seras just shook her head. She could discipline Rally 
for her carelessness &#150; but to avoid an accident, she just found the seat 
belts and prayed that they didn&#39;t.

THE HELLSING MANSION, FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER...

The Cobra somehow managed to make it back to the mansion without either 
wrecking or the two getting pulled over. As soon as it made it to the 
motor pool, though, Rally jumped out of the driver&#39;s seat and raced into 
the mansion. Berttle, working on one of the organization&#39;s troop 
transports, managed to pull himself from under it. &quot;What&#39;s got her all 
so fired-up, love?&quot; he asked Seras.

&quot;Later,&quot; the Draculina said. &quot;Right now, I better warn Master that 
Rally&#39;s coming.&quot; She then concentrated, sending her telepathic message.

Remembering the house rules, Rally&#39;s pace slowed to a brisk pace as she 
entered the great room. &quot;Ah Miss Vincent, you are back. How was your 
trip... and where is Miss Victoria?&quot; asked Walter, who was polishing one 
of the banisters of the great staircase.

&quot;Right behind me,&quot; replied Rally, rather sharply. &quot;Where&#39;s Misty?&quot;

&quot;She is in the drawing room, along with Sir Integra and Alucard,&quot; the 
butler replied.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; was all Rally said as she hurried in the general direction of 
the drawing room. Walter just sighed as he continued with his work.

The double doors to the drawing room burst open, Rally&#39;s face a mixture 
of anger and concern. &quot;Okay, Alucard!&quot; she snarled, &quot;You better not put 
you scuzzy hands on Misty or I&#39;ll...&quot; but then stopped dead in her 
tracks.

Misty, Alucard and Sir Integra were sitting in comfortable chairs, 
apparently engaged in quiet conversation. &quot;Oh hi, Rally!&quot; Misty called 
out. &quot;Nice of you to come by!&quot;

Rally then ran to Misty&#39;s side, holding her shoulders in a show of 
concern. &quot;Are you alright, Misty? Alucard didn&#39;t hurt you or anything?&quot;

&quot;Rally?&quot; Sir Integra asked, looking confused. &quot;Why in the world would 
Alucard do anything like that?&quot;

&quot;Take it easy, Rally,&quot; Misty giggled, removing Rally&#39;s hands from her 
shoulders. &quot;Alucard was a perfect gentleman. We had High Tea when I 
arrived, during which we talked about what happened to you. But it&#39;s 
nice you were so concerned.&quot;

Now Rally&#39;s face had a look of disbelief. She stared at the No-Life 
King, who was looking at her with a look of smug self-assurance. 
&quot;Alucard... a perfect gentleman?&quot; she muttered, still looking at Alucard 
doubtfully.

&quot;Now why in the world would you doubt your friend&#39;s word, fledgling?&quot; 
drolled the nosferatu. &quot;I do have more than five hundred years of 
experience in these matters.&quot; He then got himself up, saying, &quot;I believe 
I will be going to check on Walter, see how he&#39;s faring.&quot; He then 
disappeared from view.

&quot;And I believe I have got paperwork that needs tending to,&quot; the Hellsing 
leader added, also getting up. &quot;Rally, this might be an opportunity to 
reacquaint yourself with Miss Brown, so I will be leaving you two 
alone.&quot;

&quot;I-Integra &#150; wait!&quot; Rally sputtered, but it was no use. Sir Integra had 
left both vampire and human alone. Feeling like she had a pit inside her 
stomach, Rally finally turned to Misty. &quot;I... I guess I got a lot of 
explaining to do...&quot;

&quot;Rally, don&#39;t worry,&quot; Misty began, motioning Rally to sit down, &quot;I 
already know. Before I came here, I learned what happened to you from 
May, then Roy and Becky.&quot;

&quot;So... you already knew... that I&#39;m a vampire,&quot; replied Rally in a low 
voice. &quot;Then... why did you came here?&quot;

&quot;Because I wanted to learn more of what had happened &#150; how Goldie had 
kidnapped May to get to you, how you went to rescue her,&quot; Misty then 
took a deep breath before continuing, &quot;and how you died, then became a 
vampire and killed Goldie. Rally &#150; I could never be as brave as you 
were.&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; the dusky vampire began, her head bowed, &quot;what had happened 
was that I blundered into one of Goldie&#39;s traps, and in doing so ended 
up like this for perhaps all eternity.&quot; Rally then looked up to her 
friend, a single bloody tear trailing down one eye, &quot;But I think the 
most difficult thing I&#39;m doing right now,&quot; she managed to choke out, &quot;is 
facing you. I... I feel like I screwed up what could&#39;ve been the best 
thing in my life...&quot; but then stopped when Misty blotted out the tear.

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Rally,&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;I know about Seras, too... 
and believe me, I couldn&#39;t be happier for you. Granted, I still love 
you... but to tell you the truth, I was the one to screw up, not you.&quot; 
She then settled down before continuing, &quot;I was the one who ran when 
Goldie returned, not you. You didn&#39;t care at all about her.&quot;

&quot;Gosh, Misty,&quot; Rally managed to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say. I 
mean... you know that me and Master are lovers... and you don&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;Of course I don&#39;t mind, Rally,&quot; the brown-haired girl said. &quot;You 
managed to straighten out my life, I&#39;m forever grateful for that. If it 
weren&#39;t for you, I could&#39;ve ended up in prison... or dead.&quot;

&#39;That&#39;s funny, that was exactly what the other Misty said about her 
Rally,&#39; the dusky vampire thought ironically. Standing up, Rally 
gathered up Misty in her arms and said, &quot;I&#39;m glad to hear you say that, 
Misty. Ever since I got that letter from you... my mind has been a mess 
trying to figure out what to say to you.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sorry if I worried you so much,&quot; Misty laughed. &quot;But there is 
one thing I like to do before I leave tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;And what&#39;s that?&quot; Rally asked.

&quot;May told me that, before you left with the Hellsing Organization,&quot; 
Misty started, &quot;that she, Roy and Becky gave you units of their blood.&quot; 
Rally nodded. &quot;I was wondering if I can donate a unit of blood to give 
to you?&quot;

Rally smiled. &quot;Misty... I&#39;d be honored if you would.&quot; The two then 
embraced each other, reveling in the silence between them...

...Until someone cleared their throat. Startled, and still in an 
embrace, Rally and Becky turned to the drawing room&#39;s entrance, where 
Seras was leaning on the jamb, smiling. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said slyly, 
&quot;but what exactly are your intentions towards my fledgling, Miss Brown?&quot;

&quot;Uhhh...&quot; Misty moaned, a little startled.

Rally, however, laughed. &quot;C&#39;mon, Master, stop teasing her. Oh how rude, 
I should introduce you two.&quot; She broke the embrace and turned Misty 
around. &quot;Misty, this is the person whom I call &#39;Master&#39;, Seras 
Victoria.&quot;

&quot;Pleased to meet you, Misty,&quot; Seras began, but was startled when Misty 
embraced her.

&quot;You were the one who saved Rally,&quot; said Misty, still hugging Seras. 
&quot;I&#39;m so happy you were the one who did so.&quot; A little concerned, the 
Draculina looked up to Rally, who was smiling smugly.

&quot;Uh... thank you... I think,&quot; replied Seras, feeling a little 
embarrassed. Breaking-off the embrace, she continued with, &quot;Look, why 
don&#39;t we sit down for a while. I&#39;m certain we&#39;ve got a lot to talk 
about.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; chirped Misty. Then all three of them set themselves down, where 
they engaged in a happy conversation, one that lasted until the wee 
hours of the morning.
