<pre>LONDON, PICCADILLY CIRCUS, ALL HALLOW&#39;S EVE...

All around the historic landmark of the city, there was an atmosphere of 
festivity. Citizens in all sorts of costumes milled about, either 
visiting their favorite haunts, or taking in a street show by one of the 
vagabond performers there. Yet with all the frivolity around them, it 
couldn&#39;t do anything to staunch Irene &quot;Rally&quot; Vincent&#39;s sour mood. &quot;I&#39;m 
beginning to have an idea why Alucard doesn&#39;t like this holiday much,&quot; 
she groused.

&quot;Oh not again?&quot; Moria Hedgley sighed, walking alongside Rally as well as 
Seras Victoria. All three women were not dressed in their usual Hellsing 
regalia, instead dressed in street clothes; Moria wearing jeans, a 
frilly blouse as well as a denim jacket, Seras with a black top and 
shorts with spiked collar and spiked bracelets around her wrists and 
ankles, and Rally in her usual leather jacket, jeans and white 
turtleneck, sans Hellsing patches. &quot;Rally, you&#39;ve been complaing ever 
since we&#39;ve left the mansion.&quot;

&quot;Yes, please try to enjoy yourself,&quot; the Draculina added.

&quot;I&#39;m trying, Master, but wherever I look tonight, I can&#39;t help but feel 
offended!&quot; Rally indicated to the various people in costumes - some of 
them dressed like campy vampires from cheap 1930&#39;s melodramas. &quot;When I 
was a kid, I used to enjoy seeing all this. But now that I&#39;m a vampire, 
everytime I see a bunch of cheap Dracula wannabees, all I want to do is 
to strangle whoever&#39;s wearing it!&quot;

&quot;Rally Vincent, you are being immature!&quot; Moria scolded, walking in front 
of the dusky vampire. &quot;I realize how you feel, but you have no right to 
dictate how these people choose to entertain themselves!&quot; She then took 
a breath and added, &quot;This is only once a year, so try to be more 
tolerant. After all, I find all this quite amusing.&quot;

Rally didn&#39;t say anything, instead pointing over Moria&#39;s shoulder. 
Curious, the young maid turned in the direction her friend/lover was 
indicating - and nearly choked on her words! Standing in a group were 
two men dressed as cheesy werewolves, ala Lon Chaney. It was all that 
the young woman/werewolf could do to keep her blood from boiling. 
&quot;A-hem... well,&quot; Moria began, still feeling flustered, &quot;there, of 
course, is no accounting for taste, but there&#39;s... er... no reason to 
kill anyone.&quot; Seras couldn&#39;t help but to giggle at the sight.

&quot;All the same,&quot; Rally added, &quot;there&#39;s still business to take care of 
tonight. There was a few killings around here the past week, all of them 
possibly FREAK involved. It&#39;s dollars-to-doughnuts that creep will try 
to use the holiday for his hunts.&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Seras said, nodding. &quot;We have to keep our eyes open if we&#39;re 
to find him... or her.&quot;

&quot;But where?&quot; Moria added. &quot;The streets are so crowded, there&#39;s no 
telling where the FREAK is.&quot;

All of a sudden, Rally&#39;s eyes widened, then she looked towards a side 
street. &quot;Maybe we don&#39;t have to,&quot; she said.

&quot;I take it you&#39;ve found him,&quot; the maid said, noticing Rally&#39;s reaction.

Rally nodded in agreement. &quot;From what I can tell, he&#39;s very hungry.&quot;

&quot;Then we better make sure he goes away unappeased,&quot; Seras said, her face 
grim. &quot;Moria, you still have your gun?&quot;

&quot;In my organizer,&quot; the maid said, patting the bag she had slung over her 
shoulder.

&quot;Good. Rally, you take up the point,&quot; the Draculina said. &quot;We&#39;ll follow 
behind.&quot;

&quot;Gotcha, Master.&quot; The three soon took-off into the side street, avoiding 
as many of the revelers as they could.

&quot;Oi c&#39;mon!&quot; the young lady, dressed like a zombie, moaned. &quot;Y&#39; said w&#39; 
were goin&#39; to a party, but w&#39;ve been doin&#39; nothin&#39; but walk around 
aimlessly!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve said it would be a distance, so stop bitchin&#39;!&quot; a 
young man in a clown outfit complained. For the past five minutes, he 
had led the young woman in what appeared to be a random excursion around 
Piccadilly Circus but not settling upon a final location. Finally 
getting his bearings, he motioned her to one of the side streets, one 
that was deserted. &quot;Okay, w&#39;re &#39;ere!&quot;

Almost immedietly, the girl was disappointed. &quot;Wot do you mean w&#39;re 
here? This is just a blind alley, there&#39;s nobody &#39;ere! W&#39;ere&#39;s th&#39; 
party?&quot;

&quot;Oh it&#39;s &#39;ere, love... an&#39; you&#39;re th&#39; party!&quot; Quickly, the girl turned 
around to discover her date was grinning at her with sharpened fangs! 
She tried to scream, only to have her mouth gagged by the FREAK&#39;s hand. 
&quot;Jus&#39; shut y&#39;r gob an&#39; it&#39;ll be over very quick, bitch!&quot; With that, he 
quickly leaned over to bite her throat - only to have someone tap his 
shoulder. &quot;Okay, y&#39; better &#39;ave...&quot; but his complaint was cut-off when 
his collar got grabbed and he got thrown across the alley. As soon as he 
recovered, though, he saw three women, all armed, coming after him. 
Rather than take his chances, he decided to take off deeper into the 
alleys.

&quot;He&#39;s headed into the back streets!&quot; Seras called-out, making pursuit 
with Moria following close behind her.

&quot;You guys follow him!&quot; Rally added, &quot;I&#39;ll take care of the little 
problem he&#39;s left!&quot; As soon as the two depart, the dusky vampire then 
hoists the intended victim to her feet.

&quot;OH GOD!?!?&quot; the girl gasped, seeing Rally&#39;s glowing red eyes. &quot;PLEASE, 
I DON&#39;T WANT TO DIE!!! PLEASE DON&#39;T KILL ME!!!&quot;

&quot;Calm down, willya?&quot; Rally then stared intently into the girl&#39;s eyes. 
&quot;Now here&#39;s what I want you to do... this has been an exhausting night. 
Why don&#39;t you go home and go to sleep?&quot;

Abruptly, the girl quieted down, looking sleepily into Rally&#39;s eyes. 
&quot;Come t&#39; think of it,&quot; she said drowsily, &quot;I am feeling a bit 
shagged-out.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Rally added. &quot;You&#39;re going to go home, go to sleep, and 
when you wake up tomorrow, you&#39;re not going to remember anything that 
happened tonight. Understand?&quot; The girl nodded. &quot;Good. And if you do 
remember anything, it&#39;ll be nothing but a bad dream. Now why don&#39;t you 
take off.&quot; Releasing her, the dusky vampire smiled with satisfaction as 
the girl slowly left the alley. &quot;Okay, now for the hard part.&quot; Rally 
then took of in the direction her friends/lovers went.

The FREAK, in the meantime, found himself in a dead-end alley. Cornered, 
he turned to face his assailants, Moria already transformed into her 
semi-human form. &quot;Y&#39; miserable bitches!&quot; he snarled. &quot;I was about to 
&#39;ave m&#39; lunch and y&#39; spoiled it!&quot;

&quot;It was fortunate we did,&quot; Moria snarled back, her clawed hands raised 
in preparation for attack. &quot;Loathsome sods like you deserve what you 
give out!&quot; She then charged, slashing at the artificial vampire with 
reckless abandon. For the better part of thirty seconds, the two 
clashed, slashing and parrying in turn, until the FREAK found an opening 
and charged to Moria&#39;s side, avoiding her claws in the process... only 
to get stopped by shots from Seras&#39; silenced pistol.

&quot;Tough luck, you bastard!&quot; the Draculina growled as she discharged her 
gun until the clip was empty. Taking advantage of the FREAK&#39;s 
staggering, Seras lunged forward, plunging her right arm into his chest, 
piercing his heart. The fake vampire gurgled for a bit before his body 
exploded into a bloody cloud, with the two women moving to avoid it.

&quot;Hey, didn&#39;t you save any for me?&quot; Rally called-out in a disappointed 
tone from behind, racing to meet the two.

&quot;Sorry, love,&quot; Seras replied. &quot;He was about to get away and had to act 
fast.&quot;

&quot;I really should take better care not to let more of those FREAKs pass 
me the way he did,&quot; Moria added, reverting to her purely human form.

&quot;Don&#39;t let it throw you too much,&quot; Rally chirped, embracing Moria from 
behind. &quot;At least I took care of his potential victim. Hopefully, if she 
remembers anything from tonight, it&#39;ll just look as if it was a bad 
dream.&quot; The three then left the alley and rejoined the revelry on the 
main streets. &quot;Well, at least we can tell Integra we got to that FREAK 
before he caused any more harm.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Seras agreed. &quot;We better let her know the problem&#39;s dealt with.&quot;

While Seras was making the call to the Hellsing mansion, Moria sided-up 
to Rally and said, &quot;So, what will we do now, with the FREAK taken care 
of?&quot;

Rally was about to answer when she felt a tapping from behind her. 
Turning around, she nearly jumped out of her skin when she saw a short 
man, made up as a movie vampire, leer at her and asked, &quot;&#39;Ey baby... 
wanna neck?&quot;

All too late, Seras realized what had happened. &quot;Now Rally, please calm 
down!&quot; she called-out.

&quot;Yes, this is no time to get upset!&quot; Moria begged.

The man could only scratch his head, wondering why they would say such 
things. He didn&#39;t see Rally, who was turned around and had a furious 
look on her face, as well as her eyes glowing.

A few seconds later, Moria was trying to keep up with a 
thoroughly-incensed Rally. &quot;I don&#39;t believe you!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;How 
can you act like the way you did?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t try to reason with her if I were you,&quot; Seras added, also 
trying to keep up. &quot;If you ask me, that wanker had it coming!&quot; Moria, 
however, was still complaing, all the while trying to match Rally&#39;s 
accelerated pace.

In the meantime, the man was recovering from having been shoved 
head-first into a trash receptacle. &quot;Oi... wot &#39;appened?&quot; he asked... 
just before an overly-drunk man stumbled over and threw up in the can.
