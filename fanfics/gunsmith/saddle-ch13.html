<h1>Back in the Saddle (part 13 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../gunsmith/index.html">Gunsmith Cats</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../gunsmith/saddle-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Roy chewed his pizza with gusto, chugged a few swallows of beer, then 
sat back, in a very receptive mood.

&quot;It&#146;s amazing how sloppy Long really was.&quot; He said, with a nod to 
Cowboy. &quot;Keaton told him to have the operation moved out of the 
vacated area, but Long didn&#146;t want to lose a few bucks.&quot;

Cowboy nodded her agreement. &quot;He was a slime for sure.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Becky prodded, &quot;the cops knew about Keaton&#146;s man on the inside?&quot; 

Roy nodded. &quot;Practically from the first, but we couldn&#146;t do anything 
about it until he actually interfered. Your call was just what we 
needed.&quot; 

Becky smiled and said &quot;ka-ching!&quot; happily. They all laughed.

Roy slapped the table lightly. &quot;I have something for you, Rally.&quot; He 
reached into his jacket and pulled out a laminated card. &quot;You&#146;re 
officially off suspension as of three days ago.&quot; He grinned. &quot;Just had 
a few of the records backdated, so you wouldn&#146;t be in any trouble for 
your escapades.&quot;

Rally thanked him and took back the license with a grin.

&quot;What happened to the repulsively named Yu-Genics Labs?&quot; Cowboy 
inquired around another bite of pizza.

May coughed a little. Cowboy stared at her until the blonde blushed. 
&quot;Uh, they had an accident.&quot; She glanced up at Ken, who seemed to be 
very busy with his beer. &quot;Right, Ken?&quot; He looked startled, then 
grinned. 

&quot;Maybe.&quot; 

Becky&#146;s eyebrows shot up and she laughed. &quot;A small explosion, 
perhaps?&quot;

Neither Ken nor May would confirm this, but, May explained, they 
seemed to have some real safety issues there. Things like that can be 
dangerous.

Roy nodded. &quot;Yu-Genics won&#146;t be developing any new products anytime 
soon.&quot;

&quot;But what about the guns Keaton was shipping out?&quot; Cowboy asked. 

&quot;You have to read the paper more. There was a terrible fire yesterday 
in the vacated area.&quot; Rally commented. &quot;The Mayor&#146;s office is thinking 
of suspending the program, since so many of the vacated areas don&#146;t 
seem to be any safer. Arson, murder, rape&#133;it&#146;s all so grim.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said Becky, &quot;it&#146;s not like they know about everything that 
went on.&quot;

&quot;Yes they do.&quot; Roy said. &quot;The Mayor knows that Keaton was shot by Long 
&#150; they found the gun, which was one of the new paper ones&#133;they traced 
it back to the double murder.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Rally asked. &quot;You can&#146;t get ballistics reports off a paper 
pistol, can you?&quot;

Roy made a face. &quot;Long made a lot of mistakes. Including using unusual 
ammo. Plus he had a strange quirk.&quot;

&quot;He carved his victim&#146;s names in the bullets he used to kill them.&quot; 
Cowboy interrupted darkly. &quot;Little pervert got off on it.&quot;

Roy nodded. He swigged the last of his beer and stood. &quot;I gotta get 
back to the office. Thanks for dinner.&quot; He waved at everyone. 

Becky wiped her mouth and stood, as well. &quot;Can I bum a ride? I need to 
get back and get some work done.&quot; Roy nodded and held out a hand to 
guide her to the door. Becky looked back over her shoulder. &quot;Thanks 
for the dinner, Rally &#150; but don&#146;t think that evens us up. You owe me 
$750 for the info about the warehouse &#150; I got bills to pay too.&quot; 

Rally reassured her offhandedly and ignored Becky&#146;s scowls as she and 
Roy left.

May also stood. &quot;Ken and I have a date tonight.&quot; She grinned, &quot;And 
tomorrow&#133;possibly the next day, too.&quot; She tugged at Ken&#146;s arm. He rose 
willingly and let the blonde drag him off. &quot;We&#146;ll see you later &#150; much 
later.&quot; Laughing, May and Ken left the restaurant.

When the door had closed behind them, Rally stared down at the table 
in front of her. Cowboy looked down at her and asked. &quot;I feel like a 
little speed, don&#146;t you? How about a ride? Your Cobra&#146;s still in the 
shop&#133;&quot; she let the sentence linger. 

Almost as if to herself, Rally answered, &quot;That would be nice.&quot;

***

They had left the city behind and hit open roads. Cowboy opened up the 
throttle and fields were passing by at a dizzying rate. Rally closed 
her eyes and let the motion carry her away. The air buffeted her arms 
and legs, and robbed her of breath. Cowboy&#146;s body protected her 
against the full force of the wind, but Rally wasn&#146;t sure she wanted 
that.

She could feel their speed climb, and the lazy, winding roads of the 
countryside became a grand prix course. Taking turns too low and too 
fast, Cowboy pushed her bike to its limits. Rally could feel her blood 
pound in time with the engine, feel the buzz that speed always gave 
her. Light-headed, she laughed out loud.

Cowboy answered the unspoken thought. &quot;It&#146;s all good out here, ain&#146;t 
it?&quot;

Rally tapped Cowboy on her right arm and gestured. Cowboy headed them 
that way, following progressively narrower roads, then at last a dirt 
path to a long, low airstrip in the middle of nothing.

Both women climbed off the bike. Rally took the helmet from her head 
and looked down at it. &quot;Was this hers?&quot; She asked. 

Cowboy, who was stretching, looked over in surprise. &quot;Uh, Lynda&#146;s, you 
mean?&quot; She shook her head. &quot;It was left to me by a pretty little thing 
named Janie. She was little in every way but one.&quot; Catching Rally&#146;s 
eye she grinned. &quot;Her heart&#133;you got a dirty mind.&quot;

Rally grinned back. &quot;I keep bad company. It gets to you after a 
while.&quot; She leaned back against the fence and stared up at the stars. 
They wheeled overhead and made her giddy. 

&quot;I&#146;m not used to this much space.&quot; Rally said. She could feel Cowboy 
lean against the fence next to her.

&quot;I didn&#146;t realize how much I miss it.&quot; Cowboy commented softly. &quot;At 
home all there is is space.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;d crush me.&quot; Rally pushed off the fence and walked a few steps 
into the night. &quot;I&#146;d feel positively two dimensional under all that 
weight.&quot;

Silence fell.

After a few minutes, Cowboy shifted where she stood. &quot;Rall, I&#146;m going 
to have to leave soon&#133;&quot;

Rally interrupted, turning to face the tall brunette. &quot;Cowboy,&quot; she 
said, &quot;shut up and come here.&quot;

Cowboy stood to her full height and took three long steps. Looking 
down at Rally, she gathered the shorter woman in her arms and kissed 
her. This time, Rally didn&#146;t hold back. She threw herself into the 
kiss with a passion that made Cowboy gasp. When Rally pulled away, 
Cowboy found herself breathless.

Rally walked back to the bike and picked up the helmet once again. 
&quot;You were right about something.&quot; She looked back at Cowboy. &quot;You 
can&#146;t live afraid.&quot; Rally shoved the helmet onto her head. &quot;Let&#146;s go 
home.&quot;

***

It wasn&#146;t what she expected. It wasn&#146;t like losing control, nor was it 
the opposite. Making love was, Rally thought, just like a good session 
at the firing range. Blood humming, senses alert, body and mind 
functioning together. Cowboy was gentle and hard by turn, coaxing 
Rally, ordering her, teasing her, until any resistance she might have 
had simply disappeared.

Every time Cowboy touched her, it was as if she traced shapes of fire 
along Rally&#146;s skin. When the tall woman lowered her head to suck at 
Rally&#146;s breast, sounds she couldn&#146;t have imagined making were ripped 
from her throat. She found herself holding Cowboy there, trapping her, 
asking her to suck on her.

Cowboy sounded content to do so, and for a very long time, but not 
long enough, stroked, squeezed and sucked on Rally, until she thought 
her blood would burst from her body. Pressing herself against Cowboy&#146;s 
lean form, Rally gasped repeatedly as tongue brushed over sensitive 
nipples. Warmth, then coolness, as Cowboy lifted herself away, blowing 
lightly on Rally&#146;s skin. Never before had she felt so hard, so hot. 
Rally ran one leg up Cowboy&#146;s body, feeling smooth skin underneath 
her, trying to pull the tall woman closer.

Cowboy began to kiss her way down Rally&#146;s body. Rally was ready for 
her and wrapped her legs around the other woman&#146;s shoulders. Cowboy 
brushed lightly at Rally&#146;s belly, then drew her hand lower. She parted 
Rally, opening her, then lowered her head once again to lick and suck 
at Rally&#146;s center.

It was nothing like a good day at the range. There was no way that 
this sensation could be replicated. Tongue and fingers stroked her, 
electricity shot through her until, arcing her body with pleasure, 
Rally surrendered herself completely to Cowboy&#146;s mouth and hands. 
Cowboy entered her, thrusting gently, deeply and Rally moved with her, 
finding a rhythm together. It wasn&#146;t long before Rally could feel 
something build within her, her body raced to find it, as she pressed 
into Cowboy, feeling slick tongue glide across wet lips. Rally came 
silently but her body, rigid with tension, spoke volumes. Again and 
again, Rally could feel Cowboy on her and in her. Panting with raw 
desire, she kept Cowboy where she was until she was sated.

When Rally once again realized where she was and with whom, she felt 
herself blushing. Unclenching her hands, she disentangled her fingers 
from Cowboy&#146;s hair and loosened the grip she had with her legs. Rally 
noticed Cowboy&#146;s bright eyes watching her and the blush deepened. 
Blinking, trying to control her breathing, Rally lay back, listening 
to her heart pound against her ribs.

When at last Rally relaxed, Cowboy lifted herself on her elbows and 
leaned her head on Rally&#146;s thigh. She smiled, a smile Rally hadn&#146;t yet 
seen on her face. A lover&#146;s smile, she thought with some surprise. 
Rally reached forward and stroked Cowboy&#146;s face gently.

&quot;Well?&quot; The Texan asked, after a long pause. &quot;As bad as you feared?&quot;

Rally smiled. &quot;Worse.&quot; She leaned forward and kissed Cowboy, tasting 
herself on the other woman&#146;s lips. Rally lay back down and Cowboy 
joined her, holding the smaller woman in her arms. Rally laid her head 
against Cowboy&#146;s chest. She could hear Cowboy&#146;s heart, beating loudly.

&quot;How long will you stay?&quot; Rally asked, her mouth muffled slightly 
against Cowboy&#146;s skin. She kissed what she could reach without moving, 
and brought a hand, almost hesitatingly, up to stroke Cowboy lightly. 
She traced shoulder and upper arms, sliding down to ribs and 
carefully, gently began to stroke Cowboy&#146;s breast, pulling herself 
close. Kissing around the nipple, she allowed her tongue to linger, 
then stroke across it. Rally smiled at the noise Cowboy made.

Cowboy sighed happily. &quot;As long as you want, Rall. I don&#146;t have 
anywhere I particularly have to be&#133;at least for a while.&quot; She leaned 
down to capture Rally&#146;s mouth with her own.

&quot;Then stay &#150; for a little while.&quot;

***

Fall was fading and winter wasn&#146;t too far away. Business was brisk 
again, both in the shop &#150; and in the streets. Rally found that she had 
stopped looking up hungrily every time a motorcycle whined its way by 
her. 

She sighed. Cowboy had been gone a few months now and life was 
returning to its normal craziness. Good and bad, she guessed. The door 
chime rang and an express messenger walked in. 

&quot;This is Gunsmith Cats, right?&quot; The messenger looked around. 

&quot;Like the sign outside says,&quot; Rally said dryly.

&quot;I, uh, got a delivery for a, uh, R. Vincent.&quot; The messenger looked as 
if he expected to be sent away. &quot;Can you sign for it?&quot;

Rally waved him over. &quot;Sure, I&#146;m R. Vincent.&quot; 

The messenger sighed wearily. &quot;Sign here.&quot; 

Rally signed the form, waited for a receipt and took the package from 
the messenger. He looked at her, gave the store a glance again, 
shrugged and left.

Rally looked down at the package she held. Unmarked, except for the 
address and the postmark, which read Reno, Nevada. Rally held the box 
up and gave it a small shake. She gazed at the box, and ripped away 
the paper wrapping. Underneath the packing material lay a gun. Rally&#146;s 
heart leapt into her throat.

Reaching into the box, she pulled out a SIG P-210-4&#133;her breath became 
rasping. Had something happened to Cowboy?

She looked at the gun carefully. Some wear and tear on the trigger, it 
needed a good cleaning, but no major damage. Who had sent it? She saw 
a corner of paper sticking out of the barrel and extracted it. The 
paper unrolled and Rally read the note.

Hiya, darlin&#146;! I hope I didn&#146;t scare you with this little trick. To be 
honest, I was noticing that baby here was looking kind worn. I can&#146;t 
think of anyone else I&#146;d trust to clean her up, so&#133;if you don&#146;t mind&#133;

Rally grinned. &quot;I&#146;d be honored, Cowboy.&quot;

I also thought you should know, I plan on swinging by to pick it up 
again in person. Figure sometime around the new year. I&#146;ll pick you 
up, say, around 5. 

Sorry &#150; I crack myself up.

I&#146;ll see you real soon, Rall.

C.

Rally folded the note, and stuck the SIG back in the box. &quot;Yeah Cowboy 
&#150; I&#146;ll see you again real soon.&quot;

Notes: 

While all the gun info in this story is accurate, it may not be 
complete, or even relevant.

The Ducati M900 Monster really can do over 200 mph without strain. It 
is, by all accounts, *the* bike to die on. ;-) OTOH, I have been 
informed that it is unlikely to go over 200 mph with two passengers. 
Oh well. I don&#39;t see the Cobra doing 150 on any American road *I* 
know, either, so we&#39;ll call it even.

There is, in truth, an Industrial Street and Alleyway Vacation Program 
in Chicago, but the corruption (and the individuals) in this story is 
completely fictitious. I&#146;m sure the politicians in Chicago are as 
upstanding as those in my own hometown.

&quot;Cock and lock&quot;  &#150; one can set the safety with a bullet chambered. 
Sonoda claims it is specific to the CZ75, but I&#39;ve been told that many 
modern guns have it.

There was something else I wanted to note, but I&#146;ve forgotten what it 
was. ;-)
