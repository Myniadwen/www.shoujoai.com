/ Indicates thought\ 

------------------------------------------------------------

Misty sat lost in thought at the dinner table in Rally&#146;s house, her 
hand absent-mindedly wrapped around a cup of tea that May had served 
her a little while earlier. Her face was blank, expressionless and 
slightly pale, with her normally bright eyes dull and half-closed. 

In her mind, the ordeal with Goldie was playing itself over and over 
again, slowly making her realize that it had actually happened. A 
small shiver rippled through her and she closed her eyes and pulled 
her chin to her chest, tensing her grip on the cup until her fingers 
shook. A tear rolled down her cheek as she remembered being dragged 
out of the car, having to see May and Rally&#146;s reaction as they beheld 
her, bound and gagged as Goldie&#146;s puppet. The battle couldn&#146;t have 
taken long, but to Misty it had felt like hours, constantly feeling 
her own pulse against the explosive collar as May struggled to diffuse 
it. As the smoke had finally seemed to clear, she remembered feeling 
someone drop a coat over her, and as she looked up she had seen Rally 
standing over her, smiling; an angel rescuing her from Hell. 

She sighed wearily and glanced up at the clock. The incandescent 
needle showed it to be 1:34 in the morning, but, despite the fact that 
she hadn&#146;t slept in over a day, she felt too nervous to sleep. Every 
time she closed her eyes, she seemed to hear Goldie&#146;s voice whispering 
in her ear, or her hand brushing through her hair with a caress that 
was both loving and chilling simultaneously. 

The warmth of the cup in her hand had died away over an hour ago, and 
now all she could feel was a slight glow of warmth from its smooth 
sides. The plate before her was still covered in the leftovers of the 
breakfast May had given her before going to bed. Crumbs of toast and 
pieces of egg seemed to be frozen in time, permanently on display in 
an unchanging gallery. She made up her mind and stood, wincing 
slightly at her squeaking chair, and, after putting it back in place, 
she padded quietly over to the door and shut off the light, shrouding 
the room in darkness except for the dull glow from the clock. 

She stood in the hallway, leaning against the wall with her arms 
clasped before her, nervously glancing up the darkened stairway. An 
itch at her side brought her hand to it, against the thick fabric of 
the sweater Rally had given her. She was grateful that Rally had lent 
her clothing after Goldie had left her only a leather bondage suit, 
but it also made her nervous. She had been attracted to Rally since a 
little after she had met her, and something about wearing her clothes 
had, despite her best efforts, been turning her on a bit. Shaking 
these thoughts from her head, she sighed, /I have to show her I&#146;m 
grateful&#133;\ she thought as she started up the stairs, silently padding 
up into the darkened hallway. 

Opening a door she quietly stepped in, waiting a moment for her eyes 
to adjust to the darkness. The room smelt of gunpowder and metal, and 
seemed fairly plain. The largest piece of furniture in the room was a 
wooden case that Misty guessed was where Rally kept some of her guns, 
and, aside from that, the bedroom was fairly simple. Rally lay 
sprawled on top of the sheets in a long white T-shirt and panties, her 
other clothes simply dropped at the foot of the bed. 

Misty crept up to the foot of the bed and stood there, looking 
uncomfortably at the sight before her. Rally was sleeping on her back, 
one hand at her side, the other on her stomach, and one leg hanging 
over the side of the bed, providing Misty with a delectable view. The 
hand on her stomach pulled the shirt tight over her bust, and her 
dangling leg pulled back the hem of the shirt enough to catch a 
glimpse of her panties. Trying to ignore these distractions, Misty 
stepped around to the head of the bed, where she stood for a moment 
before finding her voice. 

&quot;Rally?&quot; she said, nearly in a whisper. 

In her sleep, Rally murmered a response without awakening. 

&quot;I&#133; just&#133; I just wanted to say&#133; thank you&#133;&quot; Misty stuttered as tears 
came to her eyes. &quot;Y-You&#146;re the best friend I&#146;ve ever had, and&#133; and 
you saved my life&#133; thanks&#133;&quot; 

&quot;Y&#146;r&#133; &#145;elcome&#133;&quot; Rally said in her sleep with a small yawn. 

Somehow, it still felt incomplete. She had so much she felt, but no 
words would come out that seemed to be even close. Nervously she 
kneeled down, and after stuttering over a few more words she leaned 
forward and kissed Rally on the lips. She had intended to pull away 
after a second, but somehow she couldn&#146;t, the gentle heat of Rally&#146;s 
lips touching hers seemed to meld the both of them, making it 
impossible for her to pull away. Her cheeks were already heavily 
blushed, and she could feel her heart beating faster, faster; dazed, 
she let her tongue gently caress Rally&#146;s lips as she slowly pulled 
away. 

As she did so her heart nearly stopped as she saw Rally&#146;s lip quiver, 
and suddenly saw both of her eyes open and staring at her. For a 
moment silence settled over them, and except for the slow blink of 
Rally&#146;s eyes, the world seemed to hold still. 

Finally, it snapped, and Rally&#146;s eyes narrowed down to questioning and 
angry slits. &quot;Misty!&quot; she groaned loudly, &quot;What the hell do you think 
you&#146;re doing?&quot; 

Somehow, even though she had known all along it would be like this, 
she was still crushed. Tears welled up in her eyes, and with a small 
choking noise she sprang to her feet and ran out of the room. Rally 
touched her lips in a daze, what had that been about? She was about to 
simply turn over and try to go back to sleep when she heard the faint 
sound of a sob. She stood up and walked out into the hallway, 
following the soft sounds down to the living room where she could see 
the outline of Misty curled upon the couch in the dark. 

&quot;Misty?&quot; she said quietly. 

The sobs stopped suddenly, and Misty&#146;s head lifted up for Rally to see 
her tear-filled eyes. Rally walked over and sat down on the couch next 
to her, putting her hand on Misty&#146;s quaking shoulder with a 
sympathetic, although hesitant, smile. 

&quot;What&#146;s wrong? I-&quot; Rally started before Misty cut her off. 

&quot;I love you,&quot; Misty said in a choked voice, &quot;and you don&#146;t love me.&quot; 

Rally felt her cheeks burn as she suddenly lost her voice, leaving her 
stammering as Misty choked back a new sob. 

&quot;I always&#133; I&#133; I always hoped that somehow I could get you to 
understand,&quot; Misty wept, &quot;And&#133; well, I don&#146;t know&#133; I somehow even got 
myself to believe that someday you&#133; you might even like me&#133;&quot; 

As Misty began to recover slightly Rally sat stock-still. Finally, as 
Misty was wiping her eyes on her sleeves, she heard Rally&#146;s near-meek 
voice: &quot;That&#146;s&#133; that&#146;s not completely true&#133;&quot; 

Misty looked up with a shocked expression, and she blinked in surprise 
as Rally stuttered out her next words. 

&quot;I&#133; I&#146;m not sure I mean it the same way you do&#133; but I certainly like 
you&#133;&quot; she said, smiling somewhat uncomfortably. &quot;So cheer up, okay?&quot; 

Misty wiped the tears from her face and sniffed once, blinking a few 
times before looking up again. Rally&#146;s face was framed in the dim 
light from the door, making it look to Misty as if she wore a dim 
halo. Tears came back to her eyes as she clutched at Rally&#146;s arm, 
pulling herself close and laying her head on Rally&#146;s shoulder while 
the tears trickled down her cheeks. 

Rally put her arm around Misty, holding her gently. It felt strange to 
have someone in her arms, and she had to fight the slight urge to pull 
away. Rally had never really had any romantic feelings for anyone (the 
closest she had come were the feelings she reserved for her guns), but 
as she continued to hold Misty she could feel her own cheeks burning. 
Her body felt more sensitive; a gentle, tingling sensation all over 
her skin, which was more intense wherever they touched. It felt nice, 
but at the same time it made the urge to pull away even stronger, and 
she bit her lip gently as she forced herself to keep still. 

Misty gently pushed away Rally&#146;s arms and sat up, wiping her eyes 
before turning to Rally with a small smile. &quot;Thanks, Ral&#133; I&#133; really 
appreciate it&#133;&quot; 

Rally&#146;s stammering reply was both glad and regretful: &quot;N-No problem.&quot; 

Their eyes locked for a moment, and they both went silent as they sat 
staring. Almost without thought, Misty began leaning forward, her eyes 
locked with Rally&#146;s until their noses touched ever so gently. She held 
her breath, afraid, even then, that Rally might pull away, but Rally 
sat still, her eyes locked with Misty&#146;s as their lips slowly moved 
closer. With all of her courage Misty moved forward the last inch, 
closing her eyes as their lips touched. 

Somehow it was different for her; different from the other girls she 
had kissed. She couldn&#146;t understand why, but she knew it was. As she 
pulled away, Rally&#146;s mouth opened like she wanted to speak, only to 
close again without disturbing the silence. The look on her face was 
one of confusion, a struggle somewhere inside her made all the more 
difficult by what had just happened. Misty knew that she would most 
likely win her over if she was to simply take advantage of her 
confusion, but something made her stop. 

&quot;I&#146;m sorry Rally&#133; I&#133; don&#146;t know what came over me&#133;&quot; muttered Misty 
sadly, &quot;I&#146;ll leave you alone&#133;&quot; 

She started to get up, but she stopped as she felt Rally&#146;s hand grab 
hers. 

&quot;No, don&#146;t&#133;&quot; said Rally, &quot;It&#146;s all right&#133;&quot; 

&quot;What&#133;?&quot; asked Misty softly. 

&quot;I&#146;m sorry I yelled, I&#133; I just got caught off guard,&quot; said Rally 
apologetically. &quot;No one except my parents ever said they loved me and 
meant it. I just wasn&#146;t sure how to react&#133;&quot; 

The silence of the room was broken only by the sound of Rally shifting 
herself on the couch, knocking one of the pillows onto the floor. 

&quot;I&#146;ve never felt this way about a guy, let alone a girl&#133;&quot; said Rally 
slowly. &quot;I just have no idea what to do&#133;&quot; 

&quot;I&#146;m sorry&#133;&quot; said Misty almost in a whisper. 

&quot;Don&#146;t be&#133;&quot; smiled Rally, slightly uncomfortable, &quot;It&#146;s nice to know 
someone really loves me&#133;&quot; 

&quot;I do&#133;&quot; Misty insisted again as she leaned closer to her, &quot;I have 
almost since the moment I met you.&quot; 

She wanted to say more, to somehow express the depth of feeling that 
seemed to fill her, but no words came. All she could do was repeat the 
same phrase she had used before, hoping that she could make what she 
truly felt understood. 

&quot;I love you, Rally,&quot; said Misty quietly, looking down as her reddening 
cheeks once more burned under that slightest of tingles. 

Rally bit her lip so hard it hurt, and closed her eyes as she laid 
back on the couch. While the room around her was quiet and dark, her 
mind was a chaotic whirlwind of thought, all focused on one thing: was 
she in love with a girl? Lesbianism was something she had always 
thought of as strange, but here she was, listening to the rapid beats 
of her own heart in response to the girl sitting next to her. Maybe it 
was because she was sure it was sincere, knew that Misty wasn&#146;t like 
the many hotshot guys who had tried to pick her up in the past. 
Whatever the reason, Rally finally gave in, even if it did seem a bit 
strange to her, it was love, and that was what mattered. 

&quot;Misty&#133;&quot; whispered Rally softly, &quot;I love you too.&quot; 

For a moment nothing moved, the room seeming to hold its breath as her 
words came out, but the silence was soon broken. Before Rally even 
noticed Misty moving, she was pressed against her, kissing her deeply 
with both arms wrapped around her. Rally managed to fight her reaction 
to push her away and let herself go limp, relaxing as she kissed back, 
and desperately hoping that she had made the right decision. 

Misty could feel herself getting wet, deepening her kiss and squeezing 
Rally deeply into her. She remembered the few times that she and 
Janice had managed to get alone in prison the familiar feelings of 
another girl slowly coming back to her as Rally pressed against her. 
She smiled to herself as she felt the small, hard nubs on Rally&#146;s 
breasts poking at her. /She&#146;s hot, too&#133; I&#146;ve waited so long for this&#133;\ 
thought Misty as she gently slid her tongue into Rally&#146;s mouth. 

Rally&#146;s eyes opened slightly as she felt Misty&#146;s tongue touch hers, 
but soon she was twisting tongues with Misty eagerly, her eyes 
half-closed and her face deeply blushed against her dark skin. /This 
really feels good&#133;\ thought Rally as their tongues dueled, and as 
Misty&#146;s breasts rubbed up against hers through her shirt she moaned 
softly, squeezing her eyes shut for moment. Any thoughts of it being 
wrong had left her mind, replaced by the gentle lust that was slowly 
spreading through her. 

Misty smiled to herself as she felt Rally squirm against her. /She&#146;s 
getting into it.\ she thought. She brought one of her hands around and 
slid it up into Rally&#146;s shirt, causing her to jump a bit within her 
arms. Rally froze as she felt fingers slowly slide up her side, and 
she moaned into Misty&#146;s mouth as her hand settled onto her breast. 
Misty gave it a gentle squeeze, feeling how firm it was in her hand, 
its hard point against her palm, and began to fondle the unresisting 
girl. Rally had her eyes closed again and was giving out small moans 
with every one of Misty&#146;s movements, everything else seemingly 
forgotten to her as she basked in this new feeling. 

Suddenly, Rally&#146;s whole body tensed as her voice shot up a full 
octave, her body quaking for a moment before falling still. As she lay 
panting heavily, Misty drew her hands out of Rally&#146;s shirt and looked 
down between Rally&#146;s legs. Lifting up the bottom of Rally&#146;s shirt she 
gasped; the crotch of Rally&#146;s panties had been soaked through, juice 
already moistening the inside of her thighs. 

&quot;Wow&#133; you actually came?&quot; Misty said, &quot;I barely touched you&#133;&quot; 

&quot;I&#133; I think I did&#133;&quot; Rally managed to say after a few moments. 

Misty smiled and shook her head, &quot;That&#146;s incredible; I&#146;ve never seen 
anyone come just from being felt up. You must be really sensitive.&quot; 

Rally began to give a weak laugh at the remark, but her laugh caught 
in her throat at the feeling of Misty&#146;s finger stroking along her wet 
panties. 

&quot;Ill have to go a little slower here, otherwise this could be over 
pretty quick.&quot; Misty said with a sultry grin, reaching up to Rally&#146;s 
waist and hooking her fingers through the sides of her panties. Rally 
shook a bit at the touch, but didn&#146;t resist as Misty slowly drew them 
down her legs, eventually leaving them hanging around Rally&#146;s ankle 
where they were dropped to the floor with a twitch of her foot. 

Misty starred in a kind of trance at Rally&#146;s pussy, seemingly unable 
to move or even blink. She had fantasized about this more times then 
she could remember ever since she had met Rally, never once even 
considering that it might ever happen. She reached out like a dream 
walker, slowly touching the wet slit with a shaky finger and eliciting 
a groan out of Rally. The dark skin of Rally&#146;s face had blushed even 
darker, and as, Misty looked up at her, she was struck by how 
vulnerable Rally looked. The bounty hunter that she had seen as an 
invincible fighter now lay before her, with her legs spread and her 
eyes silently asking for more. 

She had intended to go slowly, working Rally up to more and more 
pleasure as she went, but, as she kneeled looking down at her, she 
couldn&#146;t hold out any longer. She felt so close to coming just from 
playing with Rally that she was almost panting, and the smell of 
Rally&#146;s pussy was beginning to tickle her nose. Misty licked her lips 
as she looked down at Rally&#146;s wet cunt: /I can&#146;t wait anymore&#133; I&#146;ve 
got to have a taste&#133;\ 

Rally looked up at Misty in confusion. She had been still for almost a 
whole minute, just kneeling and looking at her. Rally felt frustrated; 
she had been teased enough to be fully aroused again, and now Misty 
seemed to just be teasing her some more, only touching her with one 
finger. Rally was so horny by this point that her body almost hurt; 
she was about to beg the ex-con to keep going when Misty suddenly bent 
down and buried her face between Rally&#146;s legs. 

&quot;H-Hey! W-what are you &#150; ah!&quot; Rally managed to blurt out before her 
voice again shot up in pleasure. 

Misty placed a quick kiss on the wet slit of Rally&#146;s pussy and then 
pushed her tongue in deep, penetrating the moist lips with ease. She 
heard Rally barely stifle a scream of pleasure and felt her inner 
muscles squeeze her invading tongue as it probed deeper into her. The 
taste and smell seemed to dominate her senses, the juices covering her 
face from nose to chin going unnoticed as she kept trying to get her 
tongue in deeper, almost intoxicated by lust. One of her hands slid 
over Rally&#146;s taut stomach, her fingers moving through Rally&#146;s pubic 
hair and between the lips of her pussy, feeling for the small bump of 
her clit until her fingers touched the wet nub. She heard Rally&#146;s 
voice crack slightly as her finger begin to move, and she could feel a 
gush of juices inside of her as she began to rub her clit in time with 
her licks. 

Rally was so far gone that she could barely tell what was happening, 
the waves of pleasure coming from her groin seeming to wash over her 
almost continuously now. A new sensation cut through the euphoria, and 
she blinked, about to try and speak before the feeling of Misty&#146;s 
finger pushing into her ass caused another wave of pleasure to again 
steal her voice. It was not a very pleasurable sensation in itself, 
but it seemed to add an extra edge to the already immense pleasure she 
felt from Misty&#146;s other ministrations, and she made no complaint. Her 
moans redoubled as Misty began to pump the finger in and out of her as 
she sped up her tonguing, bringing Rally towards the edge even faster 
then before. 

With a final shudder Rally&#146;s body tensed, her muscles turning to bands 
of steel as her back arched and her voice shot up in an unrestricted 
scream of pleasure. Misty&#146;s face was nearly doused as juice actually 
squirted out of Rally&#146;s pussy, and she continued to lap at her slit 
until Rally&#146;s body finally relaxed and fell limp. 

Misty slowly drew her lips away from Rally&#146;s sex, a thin line of juice 
connecting them for a moment as she looked down at the fruits of her 
work. Rally lay on her back, her chest rising and falling under the 
long t-shirt, her mouth slack as she tried to catch her breath. Her 
eyes slowly turned to Misty, who was sitting next to her, wiping the 
last of Rally&#146;s cum from her face. 

&quot;Well&#133;&quot; Misty said as she licked her fingers, &quot;How was that?&quot; 

Rally tried to speak, but her mouth moved noiselessly for a moment 
before she managed to say &quot;G-great&#133;&quot; 

Misty smiled and leaned down to give Rally a quick kiss on the cheek, 
&quot;I&#146;m glad.&quot; 

&quot;How about you?&quot; Rally asked, propping herself up on her elbows. 

&quot;Well&#133;&quot; said Misty slowly, her hands squeezing her knees as she sat, 
&quot;I am feeling pretty excited after that&#133;&quot; 

After a moment of silence Rally hesitantly spoke, &quot;Can I help?&quot; 

Misty smiled down at her, &quot;I thought you&#146;d never ask.&quot; 

Within seconds, Misty had pulled her sweater up over her head and 
dumped it on the floor, where it was joined, moments later, by her 
skirt. She stood, blushing in her underwear, her pale skin appearing 
even paler in the glow of the moon as Rally gazed at her. She sat up 
as Misty lay beside her, and with a smile she leaned into Rally, 
nuzzling up against her with the grin of a contented cat. Rally&#146;s arm 
slid around her back somewhat clumsily, holding her awkwardly as 
Misty&#146;s head lay against her breasts. Neither moved for a moment, 
silence again descending over the room. 

Rally found herself hugging Misty to her, resting her cheek in Misty&#146;s 
hair as she tightened her arms. Misty&#146;s head suddenly lolled back, so 
that they were looking each other in the eye for a moment before 
Misty&#146;s gently shut. Rally swallowed hard once before leaning down and 
kissing her on the lips. 

Both girls deepened their kiss with soft moans, tongues reaching into 
each others&#146; mouths to twist together as Misty slowly coaxed Rally on 
top of her. As the kiss ended Rally was on her hands and knees on the 
couch with Misty laying under her, the two of them lost in each others 
eyes as the glow of the moon became fuller around them. 

Looking down at the girl below her, Rally could tell that Misty was 
already very aroused. Her skin was flushed and slightly slick with 
sweat, her nipples stood out from her breasts small and hard, and 
liquid was already dripping onto the couch from her pussy. She felt 
confused, pulled in so many directions at once that she simply had no 
idea what to do, urged on by feelings she didn&#146;t fully understand, to 
do something she had no experience with. Suddenly, she felt a gentle 
caress through her hair, and felt Misty guide her head down. 

&quot;Don&#146;t worry Ral&#133;&quot; Misty said, her voice gentle and breathless, &quot;I&#146;ll 
help, just go slowly until you get used to it&#133;&quot; 

Forcing herself to relax, Rally let Misty guide her head down until 
her face was pressed gently between her breasts, her cheeks burning 
against the soft flesh. Rally clumsily kissed where her lips were 
pressed, and felt the pressure from Misty&#146;s hand lessen as she slowly 
began kissing up her breast until her lips touched the hard nub of her 
nipple. 

Misty gasped and pulled her head down a bit more forcefully than she 
had intended, pressing Rally&#146;s face to her breast hard. Rally tried to 
cry out at the sudden jerk from Misty, but her mouth opened only to be 
pressed into the soft flesh, earning a second gasp from Misty as her 
tongue happened to flick the stiff nub in the process. /She liked 
that?&#133;\ Rally thought, experimentally giving her captive nipple 
another flick with her tongue and earning another gasp from Misty. /I 
guess so...\ 

Rally began to experiment more, bringing her hand up to Misty&#146;s other 
breast as she continued to tongue the one under her mouth. Something 
about the soft flesh was intoxicating to her senses, and as her hand 
continued to stroke and squeeze Misty&#146;s breast she noticed slight 
differences from what she remembered of her own. /Not as firm&#133;\ she 
mused as she earned another moan from an experimental twirl of her 
tongue, /but her skin feels smoother&#133;\ 

Misty groaned as she felt Rally&#146;s mouth leave her breast for a moment, 
the shock of the cooler air touching the moist flesh causing a small 
shiver through her body as her eyes opened. She looked down just in 
time to see Rally give her breast a soft lick, letting her tongue 
follow its curve before moving on. Misty had to clench her teeth to 
keep from crying out, shivering first from the sensation of Rally&#146;s 
tongue, then from the small bite of cold from the cool air touching 
the saliva on her skin. /No wonder Rally came so quick&#133;\ she thought 
as her eyes squeezed shut in pleasure. /This is incredible&#133; I won&#146;t be 
able to take much more&#133;\ 

Rally could tell Misty was enjoying herself, but something was urging 
her on to try and give her even more pleasure. She let her hand move 
from Misty&#146;s breast, giving it one last squeeze before it did, and 
down her side. She let her finger tips drag gently over Misty&#146;s hip as 
it moved to her inner thigh, and she could feel her body tensing 
underneath her as her fingers moved up until they touched the wet 
lips. 

A gasp escaped Misty&#146;s lips as her eyes half-opened, a small shudder 
passing through her as Rally&#146;s fingers gently toyed with her. She felt 
like she was riding the crest of the wave just before it crashed with 
each clumsy movement of Rally&#146;s hand, only barely holding out against 
the impending explosion only moments away, when, suddenly, the wave 
crashed. 

Just as Rally pushed her index finger into the knuckle she heard Misty 
barely muffle a scream as her body convulsed. Rally felt her finger 
suddenly squeezed by the slippery walls which surrounded it as a small 
gush of wetness soaked it. Rally blinked a few times as she drew her 
finger out of Misty&#146;s soaked pussy, looking at it in the moonlight as 
Misty lay panting for breath. Remembering what Misty had done to her 
Rally hesitantly licked her wet finger, and although the taste was 
little more then slightly salty it was somehow more subtly erotic then 
she could put into words, and she sucked her finger clean as she 
watched Misty&#146;s eyes open and look back up at her. 

Rally leaned down and they kissed again, their tongues dueling eagerly 
as their bodies rubbed against one another&#146;s. Misty had already 
recovered her breath, and was about to try and move her hand down to 
Rally&#146;s pussy again when a hand stopped hers; Misty looked up at Rally 
in confusion as she drew out of the kiss and looked down at her with a 
smile. 

&quot;Two to one isn&#146;t really fair is it?&quot; said Rally somewhat nervously 
but with a kind smile. 

Misty started to speak, but her mouth closed in silence, her only 
answer a small nod. 

Rally lowered her head again and kissed her on the lips, pulling back 
before Misty could pull her in any deeper. She started kissing her way 
down Misty&#146;s body, first her chin, then her neck, then her collar 
bone, slowly moving between her breasts as she traced a line downward. 
Rally paused for a moment at Misty&#146;s navel, giving it a quick lick 
before continuing down until her chin touched the soft hair over 
Misty&#146;s sex, where she stopped and lifted her head. 

She swallowed hard as she looked down at Misty&#146;s pussy, only inches 
from her face, dripping with juice and overwhelming her with a subtle 
smell. Her face lowered at a painfully slow pace, until her extended 
tongue gave the slippery lips a small lick. The taste was interesting, 
somehow beyond description. She began to lick more eagerly, slowly 
moving in closer as she listened to Misy&#146;s moans and felt herself 
responding, until her tongue finally entered Misty sex. 

Almost instantly Misty&#146;s hips lifted, urging Rally in farther as she 
felt the walls of Misty&#146;s pussy contract around her probing tongue. 
Rally felt quite lost at first, merely licking blindly in hopes of 
doing something right, but as she listened to Misty&#146;s moans she was 
able to figure out what worked best, and before long she was eating 
Misty out with at least a reasonable semblance of skill. 

This increase in proficiency did not go unnoticed by Misty as she 
struggled vainly to keep quiet. /Just a little more&#133;\ she thought as 
her hand helped stifle another cry of pleasure, /almost there&#133;\. As 
she felt herself nearing orgasm, she suddenly reached down and grabbed 
Rally&#146;s head, pulling it in hard as she felt herself go over the edge. 

A few drops of Misty&#146;s juice dribbled down Rally&#146;s chin as she felt 
Misty&#146;s body slowly relax underneath her, and she somewhat awkwardly 
stopped licking, slowly pulling her head away. Misty lay with her eyes 
closed, her mouth curled in a perfectly contented smile as the rising 
and falling of her chest began to slow. Rally stood up slowly, feeling 
out the unsteadiness in her legs before looking back down at Misty, 
who lay still, looking up at her. 

&quot;Thanks&#133;&quot; said Misty after a long pause, her eyes seeming to glow in 
the light of the moon. 

Rally blushed and smiled, but could think of nothing better to say 
then &quot;You&#146;re welcome.&quot; 

Misty&#146;s eyes trailed over to the window, where only the edge of the 
moon could still be seen. &quot;I guess&#133;&quot; she said, back to stuttering, &quot;I 
guess that we really can&#146;t stay like this&#133;&quot; 

&quot;I guess not,&quot; said Rally. &quot;It might come as a bit of a shock to May.&quot; 
Her addition came with a slight grin. 

Misty smiled at the thought. &quot;Oh well, I guess I can wait for a 
while&#133;&quot; she said as she stood up and gave Rally a hug. 

&quot;Um&#133; Misty&#133;&quot; Rally blushed as she gently but firmly pulled away from 
the hug, &quot;As much as I&#146;d like to&#133; we really should try and get some 
rest&#133; separately&#133;&quot; 

A frown crossed Misty&#146;s face for a moment, but it soon passed. &quot;I 
guess you&#146;re right&#133;&quot; she frowned grudgingly. 

Rally stroked her cheek before leaning in and giving her a quick kiss, 
&quot;Don&#146;t worry. I really do love you, really. I, well&#133; I just need some 
time to really sort things out. Okay?&quot; 

Misty sighed, but a small smile crept onto her face despite it. &quot;All 
right.&quot; 

&quot;Good,&quot; Rally smiled. &quot;Now I&#146;m going to bed, are you going to be okay 
down here?&quot; 

&quot;I think so,&quot; said Misty as she looked around. &quot;It&#146;s warm; plus, it&#146;s 
only a few hours until dawn anyway.&quot; 

&quot;Well, there&#146;s a small blanket draped over the chair in the corner. 
You can grab it if you need it.&quot; 

&quot;Okay. Thanks.&quot; 

Misty blew Rally a kiss just as she looked back from the foot of the 
stairs, and Rally smiled, lifting the hand unburdened with her 
clothing up to blow her a kiss back. Misty slipped on her clothing 
again before curling up on the couch and breathing in deeply, tasting 
the warm night air as the moon finally passed out of her view through 
the window, covering her again in shadow. 

With a yawn and one last stretch, she fell asleep, thoughts of Rally 
dancing through her head as she drifted off.

I will never write another lesbian lemon again, unless held at 
gunpoint. At least with a guy and a girl you can say &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;, 
&quot;his&quot; and &quot;her&quot;, with a lesbian fic it just doesn&#146;t work that way. 
(Grumble grumble) Ah well, hope you enjoyed the fic, it took long 
enough. 

Rally: (Walking up with a towel around her neck) Hey, have you seen 
May? 

Not really, why? 

Rally: I&#146;ve been looking all over for her, she&#146;s nowhere to be found. 

Misty: (voice from off-screen) She was complaining earlier about being 
left out of the script, I&#146;ll bet she left to go find Ken. 

Rally: Figures&#133; 

Misty: (Voice still coming from off-stage) Well, I&#146;m out of here, you 
coming Ral? 

Rally: Yah, lets go. 

What about me? 

Rally: You stay here and clean the couch. 

(Grumble grumble)
