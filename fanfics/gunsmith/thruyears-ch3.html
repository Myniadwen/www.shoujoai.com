&quot;Alitalia Flight 750, nonstop from Rome, Italy, now departing at Gate 
5,&quot; came the voice over the public address system.  Heinkel Wolfe and 
Yumiko Takagi stood near the gate, trying to look calm.  To the novice 
observer, the two looked like priest and nun waiting for another 
passenger.  However, one would be surprised to find that the priest was 
actually a woman, although she did not act like a woman.  Yumiko, 
however, seemed to be overly nervous, if her fidgeting was any 
indication.  
 
&quot;Yumiko,&quot; Heinkel grumbled, noticing the other woman&#39;s actions, &quot;vill 
you please calm down?  Your fidgeting is calling attention to us.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry Heinkel-sempai,&quot; Yumiko whispered, trying to settle 
down, &quot;but... he scares me.  I know I should be calm... but I can&#39;t help 
it!&quot;
 
&quot;Then maybe you should vake up Yumie instead,&quot; Heinkel offered.  &quot;At 
least she knows how to keep calm.&quot;
 
&quot;No way!&quot; Yumiko hissed, nearly panicking.  &quot;You know that Yumie&#39;s 
crazy!  She&#39;d kill everyone in this terminal!&quot;
 
&quot;Then calm down and relax,&quot; Heinkel said.  Yumiko decided to do what she 
said, although she didn&#39;t feel like it.
 
It wasn&#39;t long before the person they were waiting for finally 
arrived... a tall priest with blonde hair, green eyes, facial stubble 
with a huge scar on the left side of his face.  He also wore a gray 
cassock and gloves on his hands.  &quot;Well, Sister Heinkel, Sister Yumiko,&quot; 
the priest said in a warm Irish voice, &quot;tis nice ta see you again.&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed it is, Father Anderson,&quot; Heinkel replied.
 
&quot;L-likewise,&quot; Yumiko added, forcing a smile.
 
The priest - Father Alexander Anderson - chuckled at Yumiko&#39;s reaction.  
&quot;Calm yerself, Sister,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Yer kind presence and warm smile 
is a blessing unto itself, unlike th&#39;t &#39;ellion Yumie... but even she can 
be dependable.&quot;  Yumiko smiled nervously, hoping Yumie didn&#39;t hear that.
 
Heinkel nodded, and then looked up to the tall priest, &quot;Vell Father how 
is life for you these days?&quot;
 
&quot;T&#39; tell ye th&#39; truth,&quot; Anderson said, sighing, &quot;I&#39;d rather be back at 
the orphanage with all the kids runnin&#39; around than travelin&#39; to this 
forsaken land.  Never can get used t&#39; a country founded by damn 
Protestants, if England is any indication.&quot;
 
&quot;No one can be perfect, Father,&quot; Heinkel added.  &quot;So... how is 
Archbishop Maxwell these days?&quot;
 
&quot;&#39;E&#39;s fine, although at times th&#39; lad worries me, with all the pressure 
&#39;e &#39;as,&quot; Anderson answered.  &quot;However, for the task &#39;e &#39;as, it is 
understandable.  The soldiers of God requires strong leaders, and &#39;e is 
the best one for the job.&quot;  
 
&quot;Attention, attention.  Alitalia Flight 810, with nonstop services to 
Rome, Italy, is now boarding at Gate 5.  This is your first call,&quot; the 
P.A. announced, then repeated the message.
 
All three individuals took notice of the announcement, with Anderson 
saying, &quot;So, where are ye two off to?&quot;
 
&quot;Another assignment, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Heinkel said, picking up her carry-on.  
&quot;Ve vould&#39;ve been here sooner, but Yumiko had to answer questions about 
a certain... killing that occurred tonight.&quot;
 
&quot;I told them the truth, Heinkel-sempai,&quot; Yumiko added.  &quot;I told the 
police that I was... asleep during the killing of that priest.&quot;
 
&quot;Ah&#39;m certain you were, Sister Yumiko,&quot; Anderson said, patting the 
nervous nun on the head.  &quot;Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, Ah&#39;d best be gettin&#39; 
me luggage from th&#39; baggage claim... if these Protestants &#39;aven&#39;t lost 
it, that is.&quot;
 
&quot;Let us hope they didn&#39;t,&quot; Heinkel added.  &quot;If they did, I vould not 
vant to know the consequences of vhat vould happen.&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Anderson said.  &quot;I&#39;ll call in t&#39; Archbishop Maxwell and let 
&#39;im know Ah&#39;ve arrived and ye two are on yer way.  &#39;Ave a &#39;appy flight.&quot;
 
&quot;We will, Anderson-sensei,&quot; Yumiko said, finally relieved to go... 
mainly to be away from the tall priest.  &quot;Sayonara!&quot;
 
&quot;Danke, Father Anderson,&quot; Heinkel added, waving.
 
Anderson smiled as he waved back at the two nuns as they left for their 
plane.  Then his attention turned back to retrieving his baggage, mainly 
because what he had inside couldn&#39;t be allowed normally as carry-on 
luggage.
 
HANK&#39;S BAIL BONDS, LATE MORNING...
 
&quot;Oh no,&quot; Rally Vincent said over her cellphone.  &quot;Roy, tell me it isn&#39;t 
true?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m afraid it is, Rally,&quot; Lieutenant Roy Coleman said over the phone.  
&quot;Last night a cleaning lady walking to work found a priest dismembered 
and decapitated near the rectory of the local Catholic church.  Not a 
pretty sight, I can say this.&quot;
 
&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Rally said.  &quot;So, it looks like our lunch date with May 
and myself this afternoon is out of the question.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Coleman added.  &quot;It&#39;ll take the better part of the day 
gathering evidence and talking to witnesses... even though both are very 
short in supply.  We&#39;ll have to make it next week.&quot;
 
Rally sighed and added, &quot;I know May and I were looking forward to it.  
Okay, we&#39;ll try again next week.  See ya.&quot;  She then switched off the 
phone and looked at her partner, both of them sitting inside the 
reception room.  &quot;Looks like lunch with Roy is off today.  A priest was 
murdered last night and Roy has to work on it.  It was the one we saw on 
the news this morning.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s awful,&quot; May said, and then she remembered something.  &quot;Rally,&quot; 
she asked, &quot;do you think it was that priest that was accused of 
molesting those altar boys some years back?&quot;
 
&quot;I didn&#39;t think to ask him, May... but I think he has his suppositions 
about it,&quot; the dusky-skinned bounty hunter added, then stood up when the 
bondsman she was waiting for came into the office.  &quot;Oh Hank, you&#39;re 
back!&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed I am, Rally,&quot; Hank Jennings said, carrying an envelope, &quot;and I 
was able to get you the money for that jumper you caught last week, as 
well as for catching Alfie.&quot;  He then looked at Rally and asked, &quot;You 
know... I could&#39;ve written you a check for this instead of getting this 
in cash, Rally.&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry about that, Hank,&quot; answered Rally, &quot;but I really needed to get 
cash for something I have to paid off... like Becky.  Besides, I once 
worked for a bondsman who always paid in check... until one of his 
checks bounced on me.&quot;
 
&quot;I see,&quot; Hank chuckled.  &quot;Tell you what... if you need cash for 
something, and it&#39;s from your recovery fee, just tell me the amount in 
advance, and the next time you bring in a jumper, I&#39;ll get it and I&#39;ll 
put the rest on a certified check.&quot;
 
&quot;That sound&#39;s reasonable,&quot; Rally said, nodding.
 
&quot;Thanks.  Well, I&#39;ll see you two later.  Bye Rally, May.&quot;
 
&quot;Bye Hank,&quot; answered Rally, opening the door.
 
May waived back and answered back in return, &quot;See you later, Hank.&quot;  As 
soon as the two were out, she turned to Rally and said, &quot;Boy, it was 
about time you got paid.  Now we can get Becky off our backs.&quot;
 
&quot;And getting paid for Alfie was a bonus,&quot; added Rally.  &quot;Well, we better 
get over to Becky&#39;s and get this over with.&quot; 
 
The two girls then turned to Rally&#39;s car... and abruptly stopped.  Becky 
&quot;the Nose&quot; Farrah was standing in front of Rally&#39;s car, smiling.  &quot;So,&quot; 
she began, &quot;I see you finally got paid, Rally.&quot;
 
Rally looked as if she wanted to jump down Becky&#39;s throat and strangle 
her.  But wisely, May darted in front of her friend and snapped, &quot;What 
the hell is with you, Becky?  We were on the way to pay you!  You didn&#39;t 
have to come up here the way you did!&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s nice to know,&quot; Becky added, still smiling.  &quot;So Rally... have 
you got my fee yet?&quot;
 
It took Rally several minutes to calm herself down before walking over 
to the red-headed information agent and pulled out several bill from the 
larger stack she had in her hand.  Taking a deep breath, she began with, 
&quot;Okay Becky, here you go, $300.&quot;
 
&quot;Why thank you,&quot; Becky said.  However, before she took the money, Rally 
stopped her.
 
&quot;AND an additional $100 for your patience,&quot; she then grumbled under her 
breath, &quot;although that last stunt was really pushing it... and $500 for 
the next time I need your help.&quot;
 
&quot;HUH!?!?&quot; Becky gasped, looking at the money.  &quot;Rally, May, I don&#39;t want 
you to put yourselves in a bind just for my sake.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Becky,&quot; reassured Rally, &quot;the main job was at least $3000, 
plus an additional $500 for bringing in Alfie yesterday.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh... so you found Alfie,&quot; Becky said.
 
&quot;She sure did,&quot; May added, and then said, &quot;You know... it was a real 
shame Alfie turned into a thief.  I heard he was once an engineer for 
the Army.  He could&#39;ve been able to get a job in the demolition business 
with his knowledge of explosives.&quot;
 
&quot;Too bad he stole all those weapons from Uncle Sam to sell on the black 
market and ended up getting court-martialed because of it,&quot; added Rally.
 
&quot;Well, that just goes to show that you cannot predict what some people 
will do with their lives,&quot; Becky put in.  &quot;Some of them are just bad 
apples, I guess.  So Rally... what are you and May going to be doing 
this afternoon?&quot;
 
&quot;Well... we were going to have lunch with Roy, but he got called-out on 
a murder.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah,&quot; May said, &quot;and we believe it was that priest we heard on the 
news that got killed.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s sad, alright,&quot; replied Becky, and then brightened up with, 
&quot;Well, how about we three go to lunch instead.&quot;  She held up a $100 
bill, smiling, &quot;My treat.&quot; 
 
XXX
 
It was an hour later; the three exited the bistro, satisfied with what 
they ate.  &quot;Boy Becky,&quot; Rally said, stretching, &quot;You really know how to 
make a girl feel good,&quot; she then gave Becky a sour look and grumbled, 
&quot;despite being a total money-grubbing miser.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey don&#39;t blame me, Rally!  It&#39;s just my job!&quot; Becky pleaded in her 
defense.  &quot;Besides,&quot; she added, &quot;I need to save up so that I can get an 
upgrade on all of my computer equipment.  Some of the stuff I&#39;ve got 
right now is so old, it&#39;s way past obsolete and getting close to 
becoming fossils.&quot;
 
&quot;That bad, huh?&quot; May replied.  &quot;How much you need to earn to get that 
new equipment?&quot;
 
&quot;At the very least,&quot; Becky answered, making a few figures in her head, 
&quot;about $1200 for the basics.  But what I really want is going to cost at 
least $5000 or more.  But having to contend with things like rent, 
utilities and food, it&#39;s going to take a while before I can save up and 
get it all.&quot;
 
&quot;Why not just take out a loan and get what you need, Becky?&quot; asked 
Rally.  &quot;I&#39;m certain your credit score is high enough so that you can 
get it.&quot;
 
&quot;What... and have to contend with the interest rates and the fees the 
banks charge?&quot; Becky replied, aghast.  &quot;No way, I rather pay for it in 
cash!&quot;
 
&quot;Okay, have it your way,&quot; Rally said.  &quot;But don&#39;t go thinking I&#39;m going 
to be your sole piggy bank for your toys,&quot; she added, chuckling.
 
&quot;Excuse me, Miss Vincent?&quot; a voice called out from behind the girls.  
Startled, the three saw Walter C. Dolnez standing behind them.  
 
&quot;Walter?&quot; gasped Rally.  &quot;Becky, this is Walter Dolnez.  He works for my 
friend Integra.&quot;
 
&quot;Wait a minute... are you telling me you actually got to meet your 
friend again?&quot; Becky replied, stunned.
 
&quot;Of course, Becky,&quot; said May.  &quot;She came over to the shop yesterday just 
to say hello to Rally.  Caught me off-guard, I can tell you that.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s for certain,&quot; nodded Rally.  &quot;Walter, you&#39;ve got a message from 
Integra?&quot;
 
The old butler nodded and answered, &quot;Miss Vincent, Sir Integra asked me 
to tell you that, if you could find the time, that she would like to 
invite you to the consulate extension for dinner tonight at 7:30.  
Nothing formal, mind you... just another chance to talk some more.&quot;  He 
then looked at May and Becky and added, &quot;Of course, you two ladies are 
invited as well.&quot;
 
Rally smiled, &quot;I guess since I bought lunch yesterday, Integra wants to 
return the favor.  How about it, May?&quot;
 
&quot;You bet, Rally!&quot; the blonde girl said.  &quot;How about you, Becky?  Do you 
want to come?&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry, I&#39;d like to,&quot; Becky replied, &quot;but I&#39;ve got prior engagements to 
handle.  Tell your friend &#39;hi&#39; for me, won&#39;t you, Rally?&quot;
 
&quot;Your loss, Becky,&quot; Rally laughed, then turned to Walter and added, 
&quot;Tell Integra that me and May will be there.  I guess you&#39;ll be 
cooking?&quot;
 
&quot;At the very least, I will be supervising the extension staff,&quot; Walter 
added.  &quot;I will see you there.&quot;  He then entered a Rolls-Royce parked 
nearby and departed.
 
The two watched Walter depart, and then exploded in a ball of 
excitement.  &quot;WOW!&quot; Rally said, &quot;A dinner at a foreign embassy office!  
Sure beats pizza for dinner any day!&quot;
 
&quot;You said it!&quot; added May.
 
&quot;I&#39;m glad you guys feel so,&quot; Becky commented.  &quot;However, for those of us 
who have to go to work every day, it&#39;s just something to envy,&quot; she 
added with slight sarcasm.  &quot;Besides Rally... aren&#39;t you British 
yourself?&quot;
 
&quot;Now that you mention it,&quot; Rally replied, &quot;you are right about that.  I 
guess I have as much right coming there as any resident citizen here in 
the city.  I just haven&#39;t thought of myself as British living here.&quot;
 
&quot;Well who cares, let&#39;s just get to the bank, then pick out our clothes 
for dinner,&quot; replied May excitedly.
 
&quot;Right.  See you later, Becky.&quot;
 
&quot;You too as well,&quot; Becky said, waving to the two as they took off in 
separate directions.
 
AT ANOTHER PART OF THE CITY...
 
The police had just finished questioning the rectory staff about the 
death of the priest last night.  However, they were no closer to finding 
out who killed him than when they started.  Coleman finished talking to 
the C.S.U. team leader, and then headed to the rectory offices, where 
Captain Kevin Delany stood moping.  &quot;C.S.U.&#39;s finished processing the 
scene, although it is doubtful they find anything concrete,&quot; Coleman 
said to Delany.  &quot;Kevin... I know you and Gladys were close to him, and 
that he was helping you deal with her death... but you do realize if the 
allegations were true about him, we would be obligated to arrest him.&quot;
 
&quot;I know, Roy,&quot; Delany sighed.  &quot;And I think the good father would&#39;ve 
appreciated it if it were me that put the cuffs on him.&quot;
 
Coleman simply nodded, then walked over to the cardinal of the diocese.  
&quot;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s all we need from you, Your Grace,&quot; he told him.  
&quot;Your cooperation was greatly appreciated.&quot;
 
&quot;My thanks, Lieutenant,&quot; the cardinal replied, &quot;but I&#39;m afraid because 
of this, I&#39;m going to have to contact the Vatican to request a 
replacement for our priest... and that doesn&#39;t include someone to 
perform Mass this Sunday.&quot;
 
&quot;Ah believe ah can fill in fer &#39;im, Yer Grace,&quot; an Irish voice called 
out from behind.  Turning around, everyone saw the form of Anderson 
walking up to the group.  &quot;Father Alexander Anderson,&quot; he began, bowing 
to the cardinal.  &quot;Ah &#39;ad just arrived from Rome last night and &#39;eard 
about th&#39; tragedy &#39;ere.  Ah&#39;ll offer t&#39; fill fer the good father until 
&#39;is replacement arrives.&quot;
 
The cardinal sighed with relief.  &quot;Thank the good lord and the saints 
above!  Father, your arrival has been a blessing to this congregation!&quot;  
He then shook Anderson&#39;s gloved hand and added, &quot;I will personally send 
my thanks to His Holiness for your offer.&quot;
 
However, Delany seemed to look at this newcomer with suspicion.  
Although his faith called for trust, his police training made him wary 
of Anderson... and wondered why a priest would wear gloves handwritten 
with &#39;Jesus Christ is in Heaven&#39; and &#39;Speak with the Dead&#39;.
 
XXX
 
Anderson later on settled into a modest rooming house run by the church.  
Opening an envelope that Archbishop Enrico Maxwell gave him personally, 
he ran through the papers... papers which were Unites States A.T.F. 
dossiers on May Hopkins and Rally Vincent!  &quot;Humph!&quot; he grunted to 
himself as he studied them, &quot;this is what Maxwell&#39;s patron sent us... 
records on a &#39;arlot and a damned Englishwoman.  Hmmm... this Vincent 
lass, &#39;owever, does seem t&#39; be quite skilled with a gun.&quot;  He chuckled 
and added, &quot;Well, if she ever tries t&#39; cross me, she&#39;ll find it to be 
th&#39; last thing she does.&quot;  He then stretched out and left his room... 
and to his destination.
 
THE CHICAGO EXTENSION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM EMBASSY...
 
Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing sat at her desk, going over what 
appeared to be an endless stack of paperwork that was forwarded to her 
from her home in London.  Every once in a while, she would take a puff 
from the cigar resting in the ashtray next to her before returning to 
her tasks.  It wasn&#39;t long before Walter arrived in the office, wheeling 
in a tray filled with tea, sandwiches and assorted pastries.  &quot;All the 
arrangements for tonight&#39;s dinner have been made, Sir Integra,&quot; the old 
butler began.  &quot;Still trying to figure out the right words to tell Miss 
Vincent about the Hellsing Organization?&quot;
 
&quot;I have already done so, Walter,&quot; the blonde-haired woman finally said, 
taking a break from her paperwork.  &quot;I plan to do it gradually, if Rally 
has the patience.  With any luck, I may be able to give her an idea 
about what I do.&quot;
 
&quot;It sounds like a good idea... but how in the world are you going to 
tell her about Alucard and Miss Victoria?&quot; Walter offered.
 
Sir Integra looked to her butler, paused for a bit and answered, 
&quot;Hopefully, I can do so without involving them.  It would be a horrible 
shock for her to find out that vampires actually exist... provided the 
unexpected does not happen.&quot;  
 
Walter had just served tea to Sir Integra when her phone rang.  Picking 
up the receiver, she answered, &quot;Hello?  Oh good afternoon, Agent Lewis.  
What can I do for you?&quot;  She listened quietly, &quot;Yes... and what have you 
discovered?&quot;  She listened in some more... and all of a sudden, a look 
of shock came over her tanned face.  &quot;No... are you certain?&quot; she asked.  
More quiet.  &quot;I see.  Well, I do appreciate your help.  No, I do not 
anticipate any trouble as of yet.  Thank you for your time.&quot;  She then 
put down the receiver quite hard, placed her gloved hands on her head 
and slumped on the desk.  &quot;Damn it all,&quot; she growled quietly.
 
Sensing Sir Integra&#39;s mood, Walter took a step back before saying, &quot;I 
would gather it is not good news Agent Lewis had to offer.&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; Sir Integra replied wearily.  &quot;Agent Lewis had just gotten 
word through U.S. Customs that last night Paladin Alexander Anderson had 
arrived from Rome at O&#39;Hare Airport.&quot;
&quot;Oh my,&quot; Walter gasped, clearly alarmed.
 
&quot;And that is not all,&quot; she added, &quot;Also last night two of Iscariot&#39;s 
agents, Heinkel Wolfe and Yumiko Takagi, had departed from Chicago for 
Rome not long after Paladin Anderson&#39;s arrival.&quot;  Picking up a copy of 
the Chicago Times, she pointed out to a story on the front page.  &quot;No 
doubt those two were responsible for the murder of that priest 
implicated in abusing altar boys thirty years ago.  However, we cannot 
get the local authorities involved in this matter, since it would call 
unwanted attention to us.&quot;
 
&quot;Clearly yes,&quot; Walter offered.  &quot;However, what worries me is what 
trouble Anderson is libel to cause now that he is here.&quot;
 
&quot;The same here,&quot; said Sir Integra.  &quot;But what I am more worried about is 
if Rally should encounter him before I have a chance to explain to her 
about what the Hellsing Organization is all about.&quot;
 
Walter was quiet for a moment, and then said, &quot;We may have to involve 
Alucard and Miss Victoria after all.&quot;
 
After a long pause, Sir Integra replied, &quot;That is what I am dreading.&quot;
 
RALLY AND MAY&#39;S HOME...
 
For the better part of the afternoon, the two girls prepared for 
tonight&#39;s dinner.  May had long ago dressed before her friend.  Being a 
former prostitute of one of Chicago&#39;s most notorious Chinatown brothels, 
the blonde explosive expert knew the importance of selecting how to 
dress in order to impress whoever may be coming.  
 
Rally, on the other hand, wasn&#39;t as fashionably astute as May.  Whatever 
the occasion, dressing for a day at the gunshop or an appearance in 
court, Rally&#39;s fashion sense was lacking at best.  May was forever 
trying to help her friend out in dressing for success... and tonight was 
no exception.  &quot;Geez, Rally!&quot; she complained, &quot;are you going to wear 
those shoes with that skirt?  And that blouse is much too loud!  I&#39;m 
telling you, you sure don&#39;t know how to coordinate!&quot; 
 
&quot;Take it easy, May,&quot; grumbled Rally, &quot;Walter did say it was not a formal 
occasion.  Besides, I know how to dress myself.&quot;
 
&quot;Too bad your idea of fashion is knowing how to dress that doesn&#39;t let 
you holster show,&quot; May growled as she went through Rally&#39;s closet.  
&quot;Here, try this on... and whatever you do, I don&#39;t want you to complain 
that you can&#39;t fit your holster with it.&quot;  Then in an afterthought, she 
added, &quot;And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m keeping my grenades under the passenger 
seat of the car.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks for that word of encouragement,&quot; Rally chuckled.
 
A few minutes later, May had gotten her friend comfortably coordinated, 
even selecting a pair of shoes Rally would be comfortable in, but still 
look good in an embassy.  &quot;Satisfied?&quot; she smirked to the blonde.
 
&quot;Much,&quot; May nodded.
 
&quot;Good.  We still have plenty of time, so I think we might get something 
for the meal tonight... if Walter doesn&#39;t object to it that is,&quot; said 
Rally, then both girls were distracted by the doorbell.  &quot;Now I wonder 
what that could be?&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe Walter&#39;s here to personally take us to the embassy.  Now wouldn&#39;t 
that be special?&quot; offered May.
 
&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Rally answered, heading for the door.  &quot;We would&#39;ve 
gotten word ahead of time.&quot;  As she approached the door, she made sure 
the Sig P-210 inside the table near the door was handy, then opened it a 
crack.  &quot;Yes?&quot;
 
&quot;Good afternoon, lassie,&quot; Anderson greeted, smiling.  &quot;I was wondering 
if I kin &#39;ave a moment of yer time.&quot;
 
Almost immedietly, alarm bells went off in Rally&#39;s head.  Clearly this 
man was a priest, but his appearance wasn&#39;t exactly priestly, namely the 
facial stubble.  And the scar on his left cheek was equally suspicious.  
&quot;Sorry, Father, but we&#39;re a little busy right now,&quot; she answered, hoping 
to avoid a confrontation.  She then began to close the door as she said, 
&quot;Maybe if you come back tomorrow...&quot; But then felt Anderson hold the 
door open.
 
&quot;Really, this will only take a moment,&quot; the priest said, still sounding 
pleasant... but now that voice had an edge of a threat.  &quot;It is 
something to do with... eternity.  Ah&#39;m concerned th&#39; actions you and 
the young lass with ye are about to do may condemn ye both t&#39; a fate 
worse than death itself.&quot;  
 
Rally was now seriously eyeing the table.  &quot;Listen Father, what May and 
I do in this city is none of your business.&quot;  She opened the drawer as 
she struggled to close the door.  &quot;Now if you don&#39;t mind, we&#39;ve got a 
dinner date to go to, so if you don&#39;t mind...&quot;
 
&quot;Ah know of yer connection with that Protestant whore Integra Hellsing!&quot; 
Anderson bellowed, all kindness gone from his voice.  &quot;She is dangerous 
and it be best if you stay away from her!&quot;
 
&quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot; Rally angrily shot back.  &quot;May, I 
could use a hand here!&quot;  She then threw her shoulder against the door, 
closing it enough to get the gun.  But all of a sudden, she felt a 
violent kick against the door, breaking the chain and sending Rally 
flying across the floor.  She then quickly got up and drew down on the 
priest, who was now holding what appeared to be bayonets in both hands.
 
&quot;RALLY, WHAT&#39;S GOING ON!?!&quot; May called out as she ran into the room, a 
grenade in hand.
 
&quot;GET BACK MAY, THIS GUY&#39;S CRAZY!!&quot; Rally answered, keeping an eye on 
Anderson.  &quot;Alright Father &quot;Nutcase&quot;, you better get yourself out of 
here before I fill you full of holes!!&quot;
 
Unphased by Rally&#39;s warning, Anderson just glared at the two and 
bellowed, &quot;Ah&#39;m only gonna give ye this warning once, so ye better pay 
attention... stay away from th&#39; Hellsing Organization if ye value yer 
souls!  God protect ye and save ye from yer fates, Amen.&quot;  He then 
turned around and walked away, leaving two shaken women to watch him.
 
As soon as he left, Rally made a quick inspection of the door jamb and 
was satisfied that it was the chain that broke and not the frame.  &quot;What 
the hell was that about, Rally?&quot; asked May, willing herself to relax.
 
&quot;How should I know... and what was all that he said about Integra... and 
what is this &#39;Hellsing Organization&#39; he was blathering about?&quot; the 
dark-haired bounty hunter mused, her nerves wracked.
 
Then the phone rang, causing both girls to jump.  Regaining her senses, 
Rally raced over the ringing device, grabbed the receiver and snarled, 
&quot;YEAH, WHAT DO YOU WANT!?!&quot;
 
&quot;WHOA-WHOA RALLY, CALM DOWN!&quot; the voice at the other end called out and 
added, &quot;Geez Pussycat, I didn&#39;t get a chance to say anything and already 
you want to rip my head off!  At least give me that chance!&quot;
 
Rally recognized the voice on the other end.  &quot;Oh... it&#39;s you, Bill,&quot; 
she said in an unenthused voice.  &quot;Sorry about that answer, things were 
jumping over here and I was still a little on-edge.&quot;
 
&quot;Well it&#39;s nice to know,&quot; the voice - A.T.F. agent William &quot;Bill&quot; 
Collins - answered.  &quot;Anyway, I thought I&#39;d better let you and May know 
that you may have a little problem.  You see... we discovered our 
computer database was hacked into yesterday and discovered that some 
files were copied, and I was wondering if you can ask your friend 
Becky...&quot;
 
&quot;Wait a minute, Bill,&quot; interrupted Rally, &quot;what does this have to do 
with me and May?&quot;
 
&quot;Well... it seems that the files that were copied were of you and May,&quot; 
Collins answered.  &quot;We only noticed this when we got a request through 
Homeland Security from an Integra Hellsing for copies of those same 
files, so I thought...&quot; But before he could complete what he was saying, 
Rally hung up.
 
&quot;Rally... what&#39;s wrong?&quot; May asked, seeing the look on Rally&#39;s face.
 
&quot;There are too many coincidences going on, that&#39;s what,&quot; Rally said, a 
grim look on her face.  &quot;First this psycho priest threatens us, now I 
found out my friend wanted a copy of our A.T.F. files.  Something 
smells.&quot;
 
&quot;I agree,&quot; replied May, the blonde now having the same look on her face.
 
Rally then got on her coat, made sure her CZ-75 was handy, and with May 
following behind, headed for the garage.  &quot;It&#39;s about time I got some 
straight answers from Integra, one way or another!&quot; she announced.
 
THE CHICAGO EXTENSION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM EMBASSY, EARLY EVENING...
 
Still worrying about the news early on, Sir Integra paced in her office, 
not bothering to look at the latest announcements.  &quot;I sincerely hope he 
hasn&#39;t tried to contact her,&quot; she said to herself.
 
&quot;A little worried, aren&#39;t we?&quot; a smug voice called out from out of thin 
air.  Startled, the blonde woman turned around to see Alucard standing 
behind her.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry... I&#39;m certain Walter won&#39;t poison your 
guests.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s a little early for you to be up, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Sir Integra sternly 
asked.
 
The red-clad vampire simply walked up to the window and looked at the 
slowly setting sun.  &quot;You know the sun doesn&#39;t bother me, my master,&quot; he 
replied.  &quot;You&#39;re still worried about how to tell your friend about me 
and the Police Girl.&quot;  He turned around and added, &quot;You should be.  
Humans can be so unpredictable about confronting the unknown... and the 
unexpected.&quot;
 
&quot;Well whatever it is, I want your word that you do not show yourself 
unless I tell you to.  Is that clear, Alucard?&quot; Sir Integra growled.
 
&quot;Of course,&quot; Alucard suavely answered, then returned to looking out the 
window.  &quot;Hmm... it seems your friend is early.&quot;
 
&quot;Rally?&quot; the blonde woman gasped.
 
&quot;And if I&#39;m not mistaken... she seems rather perturbed.  I guess that 
fool Paladin Anderson must&#39;ve paid her a visit... if the impressions 
from her mind are any indication.&quot;
 
Sir Integra&#39;s tanned face turned pale.  &quot;No&quot; was all she said as she 
raced out of the office.  
 
Alucard simply chuckled after she departed.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry, my 
master,&quot; he said to himself.  &quot;She seems to be the strong one.  I think 
I may like her... and maybe the Police Girl too, if I read her tastes in 
women correctly.&quot;
 
XXX
 
&quot;Look, Miss... you cannot bring that firearm into the building!&quot; a Royal 
Marine told Rally as he tried to unsuccessfully disarm her.
 
&quot;Leave me alone, willya?  I&#39;ve already had a bad experience and don&#39;t 
want a repeat of it!&quot; Rally shot back.  Stepping back, she decided not 
to make a further scene.  &quot;Okay... here!&quot; she place the gun on the 
table.  &quot;Just make sure I get it back when I leave!&quot;  The Marine nodded, 
placing the gun in a box.
 
A second later, Sir Integra entered the reception center.  &quot;Oh thank God 
you are unharmed, Rally?&quot; she began.
 
&quot;Thanks for your concern, Integra,&quot; Rally snapped, then glared at her 
friend and added, &quot;Okay, what the hell is going on here?  A few minutes 
ago, me and May got an unwelcome visit from a psychopathic priest with 
big knives, and then I get a call telling me you wanted copies of me and 
May&#39;s A.T.F. files!  Something&#39;s going on here and I don&#39;t like it!&quot;  
She then was taken aback by Sir Integra&#39;s reaction to her outburst... 
looking downcast.  &quot;Integra?&quot; she asked, her voice losing its outrage.  
&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot;
 
Sir Integra sighed heavily and said, &quot;Rally... I was hoping that I could 
avoid all this, but I am afraid I can no longer do that.&quot;  She then 
placed a hand on Rally&#39;s shoulder and added, &quot;First, we&#39;ll have 
dinner... afterwhich I will give you the whole story.&quot;
