<a href="../gunsmith/niteangel-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>LONDON, TRAFALGAR SQUARE, NIGHTTIME...
 
Rally Vincent stood on the roof of a building near Whitehall, scanning 
the nighttime crowd milling about.  Most of the government buildings 
were closed now, but she knew that there were other people who roamed 
the streets during this time of night... some of them with darker 
intentions.  She had a clear line-of-sight down the street until she got 
to the Cenotaph, afterwhich she relied on her other senses to cut 
through the clutter.  A normal human would find what she&#39;s doing a bit 
overwhelming - but since she was a vampire, Rally didn&#39;t have those 
disadvantages, thanks to her training for the last several months by 
Alucard and Seras Victoria.
 
For about several nights, there were a number of vampiric killings on 
these streets, the last two were dangerously close to the heart of 
England&#39;s government.  The Royal Order of Protestant Knights Hellsing 
were informed, and thus was Rally&#39;s stakeout this night.  &#39;So far, so 
good, Master,&#39; Rally telepathically notified Seras.  &#39;However, just 
waiting here is getting a little boring.  I&#39;m itching for a little 
action right around now.&#39;
 
&#39;I&#39;m certain you are, Rally,&#39; Seras Victoria replied from the other end 
of Whitehall, Alucard with her.  &#39;But I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re going to have to 
be patient for now.  Sir Integra was told the last killings were a 
little too close to #10 Downing Street to ignore.  Master and I will be 
here just in case you need help.&#39;
 
&#39;Rally Vincent,&#39; Alucard interrupted, &#39;If there is a threat on these 
streets, you are to handle it... alone.&#39;
 
&quot;What?&quot; the Draculina gasped.  &quot;Master, Rally&#39;s my fledgling.  I should 
be the one to tell her if she&#39;s to be alone on a mission, not you.&quot;
 
&quot;My apologies for overstepping your authority, Police Girl,&quot; the 
red-clad vampire started, sounding sincere, &quot;but Sir Integra wanted to 
know how Rally will handle a situation like this on her own.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh,&quot; Seras said, blushing.  &quot;Well... I guess that would be alright.&quot;  
Again clearing her thoughts, she called out to Rally, &#39;Sorry about that, 
Rally, but it seems that Sir Integra wants to test you, so it looks like 
you&#39;re on your own with this one.&#39;
 
&#39;Hey, I don&#39;t mind, Master,&#39; Rally replied, smiling as she did.  &#39;You 
and Alucard had been busting my butt for the last few months or so 
trying to get me ready, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised Integra wouldn&#39;t want 
to know if it was all for nothing.&#39;  
 
&#39;Nice to hear,&#39; Seras answered, smiling.  &#39;Let us know if something 
comes up.&#39;
 
&#39;Got it, Master.&#39;  Rally then resumed her surveillance, taking note of 
several figures while looking for anything suspicious.  She did notice 
one couple in particular, a tall, brown-haired man who was escorting 
what appeared to be a younger, blonde girl.
 
&quot;She seems to be a little young,&quot; Rally said to herself.  &quot;She looks 
almost like... nah, it couldn&#39;t be... not in a million years.&quot;  Still 
curious, the dusky-skinned vampire watched as the couple rounded a 
corner, then continued her watch.
 
After a few minutes, Rally stood up and stretched, deciding to find a 
new perch to look-out.  She also gathered-up a sawed-off Remington 870 
Tactical pump-action shotgun - the name &quot;Purgatory&quot; etched on it - with 
ammo and prepared to leap to another roof when a scream caught her 
attention - with a voice Rally immedietly recognized.  &quot;No way - it 
can&#39;t be her!&quot; she gasped, making sure her shotgun was ready as she 
leapt from rooftop to rooftop.
 
When she arrived at her destination, she had seen the couple she 
observed before caught in a dead-end street, the open end blocked-off by 
three individuals, two males and one female, all goth dressed.  
Concentrating, Rally used her &#39;third eye&#39; to get a look at the couple... 
and her worst fears were confirmed:  &#39;Minnie&#39; May Hopkins and Ken 
Takazawa were the unfortunates under attack.  But she was relieved to 
see two constables, possibly from the 10 Downing Street post, armed with 
truncheons, arrive.  Hopefully, the two could handle these muggers until 
their back-ups showed up.  &#39;I still like to know why May and Kenny are 
here in London,&#39; Rally thought to herself.  &#39;Did they come to visit me?&#39;
 
&#39;May&#39;s in London?&#39; Seras&#39; voice echoed in Rally&#39;s head, sounding 
surprised.
 
Not liking her master eavesdropping, Rally sighed and thought, &#39;Yes, 
Master, she is... and her fianc&#130; is with her, too.  They seemed to run 
into trouble with a few goth punks, but I&#39;m certain the bobbies can...&#39;  
But before she could finish what she was saying, Rally saw in horror the 
punks attack the constables - one of them ripping the arm off one 
constable while the other two bite them in the neck.  
 
The constables soon fall to the ground - only to rise several seconds 
later as ghouls.  &#39;Looks like I&#39;ve found our killers!  Master, contact 
Sir Integra and Pip as soon as possible!  I&#39;ll see if I can contain the 
situation on my end!&#39;
 
&#39;Be careful going down there, Rally!&#39; Seras answered, just as Alucard 
made the mental call to Sir Integra.  &#39;There&#39;s no telling what those 
FREAKs will do!&#39;
 
&#39;Got it,&#39; Rally answered.  Making sure Purgatory was loaded, she made 
her way to the alley and looked for a vantage point to take-out the 
ghouls.
 
XXX
 
&quot;Oh my god!  Kenny... those... those bobbies...&quot; May stammered, seeing 
to her horror the constables rising as ghouls.  For his part, Ken held 
May protectively, keeping an eye on the three FREAKs blocking their way.
 
&quot;That was a bloody waste,&quot; the girl, with dyed-blue hair, whined, 
looking bored.  &quot;Say Mick, I thought y&#39; said w&#39; were going t&#39; pop-on 
over t&#39; the Palace t&#39; see th&#39; Queen.&quot;
 
&quot;&#39;Ay, I said w&#39;re goin&#39; t&#39; see th&#39; Queen, just as w&#39; promised, Sally,&quot; 
Mick, a tall boy with a yellow Mohawk hairdoo and plenty of facial 
piercings, grumbled.  &quot;But it don&#39;t hurt if w&#39; didn&#39;t have a small snack 
before, isn&#39;t that right, Nigel?&quot;
 
&quot;Wotever, Mick - a couple o&#39; Yanks before w&#39; visit,&quot; Nigel, who also had 
facial piercings but a shaved head and lots of tribal tattoos, said, 
&quot;and th&#39; Queen f&#39;r afters.&quot;  
 
&quot;Just make sure those pigs w&#39; offed,&quot; Mick added, thumbing at the 
ghouls, &quot;keep out anybody that comes callin&#39;.&quot;  The three soon eye May 
and Ken hungrily.
 
&quot;Kenny... I&#39;m scared!&quot; May whimpered, clinging to Ken tightly.
 
The brown-haired explosive expert just glared at the three angrily.  &quot;I 
only wish we were able to visit that friend of mine for some explosives 
sooner,&quot; he growled as the three closed in - only to be distracted by 
two huge gunshots, which took-out the two ghouls, the shots striking 
their hearts and causing them to crumble into ash.
 
&quot;Wot th&#39; flamin&#39; fuck was that?&quot; Nigel hissed, seeing their ghouls 
dissolve into nothing.
 
&quot;Okay, that&#39;s as far as you&#39;re going, fellas!&quot; a voice called out from 
above.  From above the streets, Rally leapt from the roofs and landed 
between the FREAKs and May and Ken.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you three just take a 
rest right now.&quot;
 
May&#39;s eyes went wide, recognizing her friend.  &quot;RALLY!!!&quot; she screamed.
 
&quot;Nice seeing you again May, Kenny,&quot; Rally answered back, briefly turning 
around and smiling.  &quot;You two stay back, I&#39;ll take care of these 
bastards!&quot;  Both of them nodded, not saying a thing.
 
Meanwhile, Sally was staring bullets at Rally.  &quot;Say Mick,&quot; she began, 
betraying an annoyed tone in her voice, &quot;who th&#39; fuck is this bird?&quot;
 
&quot;&#39;Ho cares?&quot; Mick answered, pulling out what looked like a machete.  He 
then turned to Rally and snarled, &quot;Alright, bitch... y&#39; best not get in 
our way if y&#39; know wot&#39;s good for you.  For y&#39;r information, w&#39; happen 
t&#39; be immortal vampires, so y&#39; can&#39;t kill us... but w&#39; CAN kill y&#39; while 
drinkin&#39; y&#39; dry!&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re vampires, you say?&quot; Rally replied sarcastically, grinning at 
them.  &quot;I would&#39;ve thought you were nothing but a couple of low-lifes 
out for a good time.  Guess I was wrong... calling you &#39;low-lifes&#39; would 
be considered an insult to the real low-lifes.  You&#39;re nothing but pond 
scum... no, worse than pond scum.  And it looks like I&#39;ll be the one 
teaching you some manners!&quot;
 
&quot;OH YEAH, Y&#39; BITCH!?!&quot; Mick yelled, rushing Rally and slashing at her 
with the machete.  For Rally&#39;s part, she held up her left arm, only to 
get it cut-off at the shoulder.
 
&quot;RALLY!!!&quot; Ken yelled, seeing his friend&#39;s arm flying off and landing 
ten feet away.
 
&quot;MAY, KENNY, STAY BACK!!!&quot; Rally called back, clutching the stump of her 
left arm.
 
&quot;Kenny, we better do as Rally says,&quot; May whispered, looking at her 
injured friend.  &quot;For if I don&#39;t miss my guess, we&#39;re going to see what 
Rally&#39;s been e-mailing Becky about.&quot;
 
Mick, in the meantime, rejoined Sally and Nigel, laughing at her.  &quot;So 
wot now, bitch?&quot; Nigel crowed.
 
&quot;Yeah?&quot; Sally added.  &quot;Let&#39;s see &#39;ow bad y&#39; are with only one fuckin&#39; 
arm!&quot; 
 
For a few seconds, Rally eyed the FREAKs angrily, the dripping stump of 
her arm slowing down.  Then she smiled - which included her eyes 
glowing.  &quot;Only this!&quot; she snarled, bracing briefly... then screamed!  
Quite suddenly, a new arm erupted from the stump, complete with the 
sleeve of her leather coat which was also removed from the previous arm.  
 
&quot;Shit!&quot; Nigel gasped, stepping back along with his two friends.
 
Rally stood up, the predatory smile never escaping her face, and the 
glowing in her eyes never fading.  &quot;Oh that&#39;s just the beginning, you 
assholes,&quot; she said, suddenly fading from view.
 
The three FREAKs suddenly started looked around, starting to panic.  &quot;Oh 
fuck!  Where she&#39;d go?&quot; Sally cried.
 
&quot;I&#39;m still here,&quot; Rally&#39;s disembodied voice said, causing the FREAKs to 
look around more.  &quot;If you&#39;re wondering how I was able to do that, I&#39;ll 
tell you.  You see, unlike you three, I&#39;m a vampire - true undead - not 
some chipped imitation like you FREAKs.&quot;
 
Rally then appeared behind Nigel, still smiling and her eyes still 
glowing.  &quot;You think that the life of a vampire is a glamorous one, 
forever apart from the rules of humans.&quot;  Nigel swung his arm backward, 
only to have Rally disappear again.  &quot;But the truth is... it&#39;s a lonely, 
frightening existence, because you know you&#39;ll outlive those you love 
and treasure the most.&quot; 
 
&quot;Why th&#39; fuck should y&#39; care about these meatsacks, bitch?&quot; Mick yelled, 
his machete in his hands.  &quot;W&#39;re all vampires here!  Y&#39; drink blood like 
us!&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s the big difference between you and me,&quot; Rally added, this time 
appearing in front of Mick, her CZ-75 in hand.  &quot;True vampires only 
drink blood from humans to survive.  You just do it for the fun of it or 
to cause trouble... like what you did to those poor constables and 
planned to do to with my friends and the Queen!&quot;
 
&quot;SHUT Y&#39;R GOB, Y&#39; BITCH!!!&quot; Mick angrily yelled, about to cleft Rally&#39;s 
head... only to drop his machete after Rally shot.  &quot;AUUUGGGHHH!!!!  Y&#39; 
BITCH!!!  Y&#39; SHOT OFF ME FUCKING&#39; THUMB!!!!&quot;  Then Mick discovered he 
was again talking to thin air.
 
Rally again appeared, this time ahead of Nigel.  &quot;Oh I&#39;ll do more than 
that, assholes!&quot; she said, again producing Purgatory from inside her 
coat.  Pumping the shotgun, she fired, hitting Nigel square in the 
crotch... and blowing it away, leaving a big gap between his legs.  For 
his part, Nigel squealed like a stuck pig until Rally shot his head 
completely off, the body crumbling into ash.  &quot;How do you like it?&quot; she 
said, producing several shells and reloading the shotgun magazine.  
&quot;There&#39;s nothing as hard-hitting as silver-tipped saboted slugs, 
chambered for 12-guage magnum.&quot; 
 
Mick didn&#39;t say anything, still clutching his thumbless right hand.  He 
then darted for the exit of the alley, pushing Sally out of the way.  
But before he could venture more than a foot, his right leg is blown off 
at the knee.  Falling flat on his face, he tries to get up, but Rally 
shoots off his left leg slightly higher up.  &quot;Hey, don&#39;t just leave 
yet,&quot; she smirked, reloading Purgatory, &quot;someone still has to talk to 
you.&quot;  Rally then hungrily turned her attention to Sally, but then the 
hunter smile she had faded when she got a look at the girl.  
 
Sally was on the ground, scrambling backward.  &quot;P-p-please don&#39;t hurt 
me!&quot; she stammered.  &quot;T&#39; tell th&#39; truth... I never really wanted this!  
Mick an&#39; Nigel came t&#39; me one night, sayin&#39; they found a way t&#39; live 
forever.  I didn&#39;t think it would hurt at first... but th&#39; next night, I 
killed Mum an&#39; Dad,&quot; she then started sobbing, bloody tears falling 
across her cheeks, &quot;and me little brother!  I beggin&#39; y&#39;... make me 
human again!  This thing in me head is makin&#39; me kill!  I don&#39;t want t&#39; 
kill anymore!&quot;
 
A softer look came over Rally&#39;s face, eyes still glowing, as she forced 
the girl to her feet.  &quot;I wish there was a way to make you truly human 
again... but I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s too late... you&#39;ve become a danger that I 
or the others in Hellsing cannot ignore,&quot; she kindly said, then added, 
&quot;But don&#39;t worry, Sally... I&#39;ll make sure no one will force you to 
kill... ever again.&quot;  Closing her eyes, Rally bent down towards Sally&#39;s 
neck... and bit into it.
 
Sally gasped briefly from the pain of the bite, but soon slowly sank to 
the ground as Rally drank her blood, smiling.  After the girl died, 
Rally got up, briefly licked the blood off her lips, then once again 
drew her CZ-75 and placed a shot into Sally&#39;s head and heart.  Then 
remembering who was watching, she turned to May and Ken, and with a sad 
look on her face, said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you two had to see this side of me.  
I thought coming here would spare you of seeing me kill like this 
and...&quot; but was surprised by a sudden hug from May.
 
&quot;Hey Rally... I understand,&quot; May said, smiling.  &quot;After all, you ARE a 
vampire.  But I&#39;m a little surprised that you would drink from another 
vampire.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s just it, May... she wasn&#39;t a true vampire,&quot; answered Rally, 
&quot;just a supercharged human with the traits of a vampire.&quot;  
 
Then the sounds of trucks caught the three&#39;s attention.  Two lorries 
pulled into the exit, whereas several men wearing Hellsing uniforms got 
out and secured the exit.  Some of them covered Mick, while two went 
over and started to escort May and Ken away.  &quot;HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS 
DOING?&quot; May complained, trying to get out of their grip.
 
&quot;Hey c&#39;mon, you guys,&quot; Rally added, trying to pry them off as well, 
&quot;these are my friends!  No need to treat them like this!&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry about this,&quot; one of the soldiers, a Spaniard, said, &quot;but you know 
orders, all civilians...&quot; 
 
&quot;YOU HEARD ZE LADY, SERGIO, LET HER GO!&quot;  Sergio abruptly released his 
grip on May when he saw his commander, Pip Bernadotte, walk through the 
group.  &quot;New orders from Sir Integra,&quot; the one-eyed Frenchman began, 
&quot;zese two are to be ze guests of ze Hellsing Organization!  Now let go 
of zem, leave them be, and make sure ze parameter is secured!&quot;
 
Saluting quickly, Sergio and his companion scrambled quickly to the 
alley&#39;s entrance.  Turning to Rally, Pip said, &quot;We got ze call from Sir 
Integra.  Seems Mignonette told her who was here.  Are you alright, 
Mademoiselle Rally?&quot;
 
&quot;Fine, Pip... and thanks,&quot; Rally answered back.  &quot;So when is Integra 
coming?&quot; she thumbed at Mick, &quot;Got someone I think she would like to 
talk to.&quot;
 
&quot;I am here, Rally.  Thank you for asking,&quot; came the voice of Sir Integra 
Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who was strolling past the assembled Wild 
Geese, the uniformed men, and to their location.  At the same time, 
Alucard and Seras made their appearances as well.  &quot;You have done 
alright for your first solo mission... although it could be a little 
neater, by the way Captain Victoria told me of your handling of that 
shotgun.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey, they cut-off my arm!  How else was I supposed to answer that?&quot; 
Rally added.
 
&quot;Exactly the way you did,&quot; Alucard put in.  &quot;I have to agree with Sir 
Integra, you have done well... as well as offering a merciful end to the 
girl.&quot;
 
&quot;When I took her blood,&quot; Rally began, &quot;I found out she was telling the 
truth... those guys really did con her into becoming a FREAK.&quot;
 
Seras took a good look at Mick, who for his credit was still trying to 
get away, despite being closely guarded.  &quot;Well I think we can make sure 
he&#39;ll suffer for what he did to her,&quot; the Draculina said.
 
&quot;And I know exactly how... after we get the information we need.  Miss 
Hopkins, Mr. Takazawa, wait here.  Rally... come with me.&quot;  Sir Integra 
motioned to Rally, and the two made their way to the prone FREAK.
 
Discreetly, Ken leaned over to May.  &quot;I think we should tell her,&quot; he 
began, whispering.
 
&quot;Later, Kenny,&quot; the blonde whispered back.
 
Meanwhile, Sir Integra walked over to Mick and kicked him on his back.  
&quot;&#39;Ay... wot gives?&quot; the FREAK yelled back.
 
&quot;Silence!  I will be the one giving the orders around here!  If you were 
a true vampire like you were boasting about, you would have healed that 
thumb and those legs and attacked us!  So keep quiet and maybe you might 
benefit from it!&quot; the Hellsing leader spoke in a firm voice.  
Reluctantly, Mick complied.  &quot;Now then, I have an offer I wish to give 
you...&quot; Sir Integra said, bending down.  &quot;If you will kindly tell me who 
placed that chip in your head, I might be kind enough to give you some 
most favorable odds.  If you choose not to co-operate,&quot; she indicated to 
Rally, &quot;then I will tell her to end your miserable existence in what I 
will guarantee will be a long... and most unpleasant manner.&quot;  Rally&#39;s 
expression on her face told the story that she would prefer he WOULDN&#39;T 
be co-operative.
 
&quot;An&#39; if I say yes?&quot; Mick implored hopefully.
 
&quot;Then you will receive a bullet in your head, giving you a quick end,&quot; 
Sir Integra answered.
 
&quot;Wot kind o&#39; a deal is that?&quot; Mick gasped.  &quot;Either way, I&#39;m still 
dead!&quot;
 
&quot;Well we certainly cannot have a deplorable FREAK like you roaming the 
countryside and causing chaos, now can we?&quot; Sir Integra snarled.  &quot;You 
and your friends were responsible for several killings here and I was 
informed that you have planned to assassinate the Queen after killing 
this couple!&quot; pointing to May and Ken.  &quot;Now talk... or else suffer the 
consequences!&quot;
 
For a few seconds, Mick mentally debated his options.  &quot;Looks like I&#39;ve 
&#39;aven&#39;t got much of a choice, now do I?&quot; he finally said.  Rally looked 
slightly disappointed.  &quot;Very well... Nigel an&#39; I were contacted by some 
bloke from oversees, said &#39;e &#39;ad something that...&quot;  But before he could 
continue further, Mick&#39;s body suddenly erupted into a mass of blue 
flame, causing Sir Integra to jump back.  Mick, in the meantime, 
screamed painfully until his body was consumed, leaving nothing behind.
 
&quot;What the hell was that, Master?&quot; Seras gasped.
 
The No-Life King just stared banefully at where Mick once lied.  
&quot;Whoever created that chip obviously wishes to maintain their secrecy.  
By the way this occurred, it was as if they were monitoring us through 
him.&quot;
 
&quot;So it looks we&#39;re back to square one finding out about the FREAK chip, 
are we Sir Integra?&quot; Rally said dejectedly, looking at her friend.
 
&quot;Yes, it would seem so,&quot; Sir Integra replied.  &quot;Very well, have the 
girl&#39;s body taken to the coroner, extract the chip from her and cremate 
her.  Then we will see if we can go anywhere with what she produces.&quot;  
She then looked at May and Ken and said, &quot;In the meantime, Miss Hopkins 
and Mr. Takazawa will accompany me back to the mansion.  It would be an 
excellent opportunity to get re-acquainted, now will it?&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed it would, Integra,&quot; May answered back, &quot;but... nowadays, I don&#39;t 
exactly go by &#39;Hopkins&#39; anymore.&quot;  Smiling, she then held up her left 
hand.  She was wearing a wedding band on her finger.
 
Rally caught on.  &quot;OH MAN, YOU AND KENNY GOT MARRIED!?!&quot; she shrieked, 
hugging May fiercely.  &quot;CONGRADULATIONS, MAY!!!  I WISH I COULD&#39;VE 
ATTENDED THE CEREMONY BUT TRAVELING WOULD BE SUCH A PAIN AND ALL!!!  OH 
I&#39;M SO HAPPY FOR YOU, MAY!!!&quot;
 
&quot;Erk... Rally...&quot; May squeaked, her eyes bugging out as she vainly 
struggled to free herself, &quot;you&#39;re... crushing... me...&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?  Oops,&quot; the dusky-skinned vampire said, releasing her friend.  
&quot;Uh... sorry about that, May.  I forgot for a second I&#39;m stronger now.  
Are you alright?  I didn&#39;t break anything, did I?&quot;
 
May took a few quick breaths and said, &quot;No... but it got kinda close.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy, Rally,&quot; Ken said, patting his friend&#39;s shoulder.
 
&quot;Thanks, Kenny,&quot; Rally said as she hugged Ken, this time more careful.  
&quot;Anyway, let&#39;s get to the mansion.  I can&#39;t wait to get caught up with 
you guys.&quot; 
 
&quot;Then why don&#39;t we head up, Rally?&quot; Ken said.  &quot;I&#39;m certain you have 
some stories to share as well.&quot;  But as the group made their way out, 
Ken briefly stopped and dropped to one knee.
 
&quot;Kenny,&quot; May called out, going to her husband&#39;s side, &quot;are you okay?&quot;  
Rally also watched, her face betraying a look of concern that Seras and 
Alucard noticed.
 
&quot;I&#39;m fine, May... it&#39;s just the excitement of tonight catching up with 
me, that&#39;s all,&quot; the brown-haired man said, getting up on his feet, 
&quot;I&#39;ll be alright if I pace myself.&quot;
 
May said nothing, nodding in agreement.  The two walked over to the 
Rolls-Royce near the lorries, where Walter C. Dolnez greeted them and 
helped the two, as well as Sir Integra board.  The Wild Geese then made 
their clean-up of the scene, packed-up the bodies of the remaining 
FREAKs, and departed, leaving three vampires to contemplate events.
 
Even though it wasn&#39;t necessary for her to do so, Rally took a deep 
breath and proceeded to leave.  &quot;Is there something wrong with Ken, 
Rally?&quot; Seras began, seeing her fledgling pause.
 
It was some time before Rally answered in a low voice, &quot;I&#39;ll tell you 
later, Master.  I just want to go home.&quot;  She then proceeded to walk 
out.
 
Concerned, Seras tried to stop her, but was restrained by Alucard.  &quot;Let 
her be, Police Girl,&quot; he said.  &quot;She has a lot on her mind right now.  
Your fledgling will tell you when the time is right.&quot; 
 
&quot;Okay, Master,&quot; Seras said, following Alucard and Rally out of the 
alley. 
 
THE HELLSING MANSION, LATER THAT NIGHT...
 
&quot;May told me what had happened to Rally,&quot; Ken said, himself, May, Sir 
Integra, Walter, Pip, and the three vampires gathered around in the 
drawing room of the mansion.  &quot;She also told me that Rally finally 
managed to kill Goldie.  A bit of relief if you ask me.&quot;  
 
&quot;More likely that the world would be better for it - if we have not 
learned about the sale of her Kerasine formula to an unknown group,&quot; Sir 
Integra added, then said, &quot;But enough of that.  I was wondering why you 
and your wife would be in London.  This city is not exactly known as a 
spot for honeymooners.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rally added.  &quot;May, I&#39;d figured you and Kenny would be at 
Niagara Falls for your honeymoon.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh that place is honeymooned to death, Rally,&quot; May answered, excepting 
the herb tea Walter offered.  &quot;I really wanted to see what this town is 
like - and see how you were doing.&quot;
 
Rally thought for a minute.  &quot;Well - I&#39;d be lying if I said I had no 
regrets about becoming a vampire,&quot; she began, then said, &quot;but I would&#39;ve 
done it again if the circumstances repeated themselves.  Nice of you and 
Kenny being so concerned about me.&quot;  She then looked at Ken and May and 
asked, &quot;So... what are you guys going to do now that you&#39;re married?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m glad you asked that, Rally,&quot; Ken said, producing a business card 
and handing it to Rally.  Curious, the dark-haired vampire took a look, 
then her red eyes widened.  The card read, &#39;MayKen Enterprises, L.L.C..  
Demolitions and Special Effects&#39;.
 
&quot;You&#39;re going into the demolition business?&quot; asked Rally.
 
&quot;You bet!&quot; May chirped.  &quot;Of course, we&#39;re going to start slow and see 
how the business goes from there.  We already got together a couple of 
contracts to clear out some old buildings in Chicago,&quot; she then looked 
uncomfortable and added, &quot;including that warehouse where you...&quot;
 
&quot;Oh,&quot; Rally added, catching the hint.  &quot;Well, I wish you and Kenny the 
best in business.  And speaking of business, I heard from Dad that he 
sold the gunshop.  Do you know who bought it?&quot;
 
Ken and May looked at each other, then Ken said, &quot;You won&#39;t believe 
it... it was Roy that bought it!  He decided to take early retirement 
from Chicago P.D., then he and his wife bought the shop when your father 
offered it.  Roy even decided to keep the name of the shop.&quot;
 
&quot;So it looks like &#39;Gunsmith Cats&#39; is still going to be a local fixture,&quot; 
Rally mused.  Then a look of concern came over her face.  &quot;Hey wait a 
minute - Roy&#39;s not a gunsmith!  How in the hell is he going to handle 
the special orders?&quot;
 
&quot;Well you should thank Alfie for that,&quot; May started.  &quot;You remember 
those two cops Goldie had killed to spring him?&quot;  Rally nodded.  &quot;Well, 
it seems one of them had a brother who was a soldier that lost a leg.  
Alfie made mention of this to Roy when he was in jail, then Roy looked 
him up and offered him a job.  Seems this guy&#39;s a very good gunsmith, 
and he&#39;s been working for Roy since.&quot;
 
&quot;Boy that&#39;s a relief,&quot; Rally sighed.  &quot;Hate to think of Roy letting the 
shop go to pot without a gunsmith.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s remarkable,&quot; Seras added, looking at May.  &quot;You and your husband 
are going into business together.  From the looks of it, you two make a 
great couple.&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed we are,&quot; Ken answered.  &quot;By the way Seras, from what we&#39;ve heard 
from Becky, you and Rally are quite an item together.&quot;
 
&quot;Er... what?&quot; Rally squeaked, then grumbled, &quot;I told Becky not to 
mention that.&quot;
 
&quot;I still find that hard to believe,&quot; May sighed, looking at her old 
friend.  &quot;I always thought Rally would die an old maid.  She seemed to 
prefer guns and cars to sex.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, I find that hard to believe myself,&quot; Alucard drolled, startling 
Rally.  &quot;From what I&#39;ve seen, sex seems to be a natural for Rally and 
the Police Girl.&quot;
 
Now Rally had a panicked look on her face.  &quot;NO... ALUCARD, DON&#39;T YOU 
DARE DO IT!!&quot;
 
&quot;MASTER, PLEASE!!!&quot; Seras added, a similar look on her face.  The look 
on the faces of Walter and Sir Integra betrayed a different look - one 
of resignation and annoyance respectively.
 
&quot;What are you talking about, Alucard?&quot; May implored, her body language 
betraying curiosity.
 
Rally now was looking threateningly at the red-clad vampire.  &quot;ALUCARD, 
IF YOU DO THIS, I SWEAR I&#39;LL MAKE YOU REGRET THIS IN THE FUTURE!!!&quot; she 
threatened, her fangs flashing as she&#39;s pointing an accusing finger at 
Alucard.
 
&quot;As if you would be able to carry through that threat, fledgling,&quot; 
Alucard smirked, grinning like a Cheshire cat.  &quot;Mrs. Takazawa, if you 
wish, I would like to relate to you a rather... juicy story about how I 
happened on a certain... intimate encounter between Rally and her 
master.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh... god,&quot; Rally groaned, bending down in her seat and clutching her 
head as Alucard began his tale.
 
FLASHBACK, TWO MONTHS AGO...
 
It was 2 AM, and Alucard found himself sitting alone on his throne, 
fighting the one enemy that he, in his nearly five hundred year 
existence, couldn&#39;t easily defeat... boredom.  Normally, at this time, 
he would find his usual means of relieving his boredom... namely, 
annoying Sir Integra.  But as luck would have it, she had gone 
out-of-town, getting more information on the Bath incident some time 
before.  It wouldn&#39;t suit him much to terrorize Pip either; he was long 
asleep by then.  &quot;Well, there&#39;s no use in sitting here,&quot; he mumbled 
irritably to himself, rising.  &quot;I might as well seek out Walter and see 
what he&#39;s doing.  At least I know he hasn&#39;t gone to bed yet.&quot;  Getting 
his hat and glasses, he strolled over to the walls of his private space, 
where he phased through it.
 
But as soon as he entered the corridor, the nosferatu&#39;s sensitive ears 
caught what appeared to be giggling, the voices he recognized as Seras 
and Rally.  Curious, Alucard walked down the corridor, and stopped in 
front of the door to Seras&#39; quarters, where he knew that Rally also 
shared.  As he did, the giggling gradually ceased and was replaced with 
what sounded like a very sensual moaning - Rally&#39;s moaning.  Deciding to 
find out what would be causing this newest vampire to behave so, but not 
wishing to be seen easily, Alucard phased through the door and concealed 
himself in the shadows of the room.
 
The canopy/lid of the coffin/bed was up, and lying on it was Rally, 
naked and uncovered and apparently writhing in obvious ecstasy, her face 
contorted as if in agony.  Also, situated near Rally&#39;s crotch, was 
Seras, also nude.  The Draculina&#39;s tongue was actively flicking the 
hardened knob near Rally&#39;s womanhood, while at the same time, her left 
fingers were thrusting in and out of her fledgling&#39;s nether regions.  At 
the same time, her right hand was massaging Rally&#39;s left breast, 
occasionally pinching the hardened nipple, causing Rally&#39;s thrashing to 
increase.    
 
&quot;Umm... oh yes... Master, there...&quot; Rally moaned, her unnecessary 
breathing growing more and more labored, causing Seras to increase her 
actions.  &quot;I&#39;m... getting close.  Oh yes... yes... YESSSS!!!&quot;  Suddenly, 
Rally&#39;s back arched up, her mouth open in a silent scream that lasted 
ten seconds.  As arousing as this was, Alucard could only think of how 
happy Rally was, being pleasured by his former fledgling.
 
After Rally had settled down, Seras emerged from her crotch, her nude 
body covering her and passionately kissing her fledgling/lover, which 
lasted a minute.  After parting, Seras looked into Rally&#39;s eyes, 
smiling.  &quot;Happy?&quot; she purred.
 
&quot;Oh yeah, Master... even more than yesterday,&quot; Rally replied.  Turning 
Seras on her back, the dusky-skinned vampire continued with, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know what I would&#39;ve done if you hadn&#39;t been there.  I mean... after 
scaring that poor girl back in Bath, I was almost at my wit&#39;s end.  I 
might have committed suicide if you didn&#39;t bring me back.&quot;
 
&quot;Well... I felt I had to,&quot; Seras answered, caressing Rally&#39;s cheek.  
&quot;Besides, you couldn&#39;t do it by walking into the sun anyway... you&#39;ve 
been drinking your blood, so now the sun isn&#39;t your enemy anymore.&quot;
 
&quot;But I don&#39;t like standing in it... and I used to like a sunny day.  
Besides... being with you is so much better.&quot;  Rally then rolled over 
and once again kissed Seras, fondling her master&#39;s ample breast.
 
Alucard paused for a few seconds before thinking to himself, &#39;Well, I 
guess I shouldn&#39;t intrude upon them too much.  I&#39;ll see what Walter is 
doing right now.&#39;  He then turned around to phase through the wall... 
and noisily bumped into a nearby table.  &quot;Damn!&quot; he hissed, already 
realizing he given himself away.
 
Seras and Rally froze upon hearing both the bump and the curse.  &quot;Did... 
did you just hear that?&quot; Rally squeaked.  Seras nodded nervously, then 
the two of them slowly turned their heads.  Even though it was pitch 
black, their vision was sharp enough to see a very embarrassed Alucard 
standing across the room.
 
&quot;Uh... excuse me,&quot; Alucard managed to say, &quot;I... seemed to have taken a 
wrong turn.&quot;
 
XXX
 
It was at that point that Walter was making his final rounds before 
turning in for the night.  He was always a light sleeper - a habit he 
picked up from his years as Hellsing&#39;s top vampire slayer.  But then 
again, all that experience never prepared him for what was next - namely 
the high-pitched sounds of girls screaming in unison, followed by 
Alucard making a dignified, if somewhat hurried, exit from the corridor.  
&quot;Alucard,&quot; the old butler began, &quot;what on Earth is...&quot;
 
&quot;Excuse me, Old Friend,&quot; the No-Life King said, &quot;but I believe I&#39;ll have 
to avoid encountering Seras and Rally for the next few nights!&quot;  He then 
disappeared into nothingness.
 
&quot;Alucard, just what did you do THIS TIME?&quot; Walter demanded.
 
The answer wasn&#39;t long in coming.  Both Rally and Seras were racing out 
of their quarters, both of their naked bodies hastily covered in 
blankets and sheets - and appearing to be armed.  &quot;MASTER, JUST COME 
BACK HERE!!!&quot; the blonde vampire yelled.
 
&quot;YEAH, YOU PEEPING TOM,&quot; Rally snarled as well, &quot;COME ON BACK HERE SO 
THAT WE CAN... EEEEEPPPP!!!&quot;  Both girls ducked around the corner when 
they saw Walter, who had a shocked and perplexed look on his face.  
&quot;Oh... Walter, it&#39;s you.  Uh... I wonder, did you... happen to see 
Alucard passing you.&quot;
 
&quot;Uh... yes Walter,&quot; Seras managed to say, equally as embarrassed as 
Rally.  &quot;You see, me and Rally were... uh... you know... and... 
Master...&quot;
 
&quot;Nevermind, Miss Victoria,&quot; Walter interrupted, holding up his hand.  
&quot;To be precise, I do not think I wish to know the exact details.&quot;  He 
then turned around, muttering under his breath, &quot;Alucard... you have a 
little explaining to do when you return.&quot;
 
PRESENT TIME...
 
&quot;I&#39;ll kill him,&quot; Rally muttered under her breath, still bent over and 
clutching her head, &quot;that&#39;s what I&#39;ll do, I&#39;ll kill him!  I don&#39;t know 
how or what I&#39;ll do it with but I&#39;ll rip his fucking head off for this!&quot;
 
As for everyone else, the reactions were mixed.  Seras looked as if she 
wanted to find some corner and hide.  Sir Integra tried to look 
dignified, but for her credit, she didn&#39;t know if she was going to yell 
at Alucard for telling that embarrassing tale about Rally and Seras&#39; 
love life or break out laughing from hearing it.
 
Ken was blushing, not knowing what to do, while his wife was on the 
floor laughing her head off.  &quot;OH MAN,&quot; May gasped between fits of 
laughter, &quot;ALL THIS TIME... I&#39;VE BEEN TELLING RALLY TO LOOSEN UP... I 
CAN&#39;T STAND IT!!!!&quot;  And once again started laughing.
 
&quot;Thanks a lot, May,&quot; Rally grumbled.  She then looked at the other 
individuals in the room.  Walter was blushing slightly, his memories of 
the incident flooding back.  Pip, however, was grinning madly.  Rally 
dreaded what that one-eyed French pervert was going to say next.
 
&quot;Oh my,&quot; said pervert began, &quot;and to think I slept through ze whole 
thing.&quot;  Pip then glanced over to Alucard and added, &quot;Pity you didn&#39;t 
tape zere little dalliance.  Could be good entertainment, non?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh you would, you pervert,&quot; Rally snarled, her eyes glowing as she shot 
Pip a poisonous look.
 
&quot;Ulp!  Excuse em moi...&quot; Pip began gradually walk away from the room, 
&quot;but... I have to make sure ze Geese are ready for tomorrow.  Au 
Revoure.&quot;  He then made a mad scramble out of the room, turning a corner 
- and caused a loud metallic banging.  &quot;UH... WALTER... A LITTLE HELP 
HERE!!!&quot;
 
&quot;It looks like Pip ran into that suit of armor again,&quot; Walter sighed.  
&quot;This shouldn&#39;t take a moment, so if you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot;  He then walked 
out of the room.  &quot;Now Mr. Bernadotte, let&#39;s make sure we get that 
straightened out.&quot;
 
May, in the meantime, had managed to stop laughing and helped herself 
back to her seat.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry about laughing like that, Rally.  It&#39;s 
just that... all the time I&#39;ve known you, sex was the least thing on 
your mind, it was either guns or cars.&quot;  She then yawned, adding, &quot;I&#39;m 
feeling a little tired right now.&quot;
 
&quot;You are welcome to stay here if you like,&quot; Sir Integra offered.  &quot;It is 
not often I have guests here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Sir Integra,&quot; Ken said.  &quot;But me and May already have a 
hotel room in town.  If you can, could you have Walter take us there.

Sir Integra nodded. &quot;Very well. As soon as Walter is finished with his 
task with Pip, I will have him make the arrangements.&quot;

It was a few minutes later that Walter brought the Rolls-Royce to the 
front of the mansion. Ken had already boarded, but May was standing 
outside, talking to Rally. &quot;Are you going to come back tomorrow night?&quot; 
Rally asked her friend.

May giggled and replied, &quot;You bet! Me and Kenny hadn&#39;t made this trip 
just for the hell of it.&quot;

&quot;I know... I&#39;m just worried about tonight. Are you sure you won&#39;t lose 
too much sleep with Kenny tonight?&quot; Rally smirked.

&quot;Oh we&#39;ve got plenty of time for that,&quot; said May, then yawned again, 
&quot;but not tonight, I&#39;m just too tired for it right now.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll let you and Kenny get back to the hotel,&quot; Rally said, 
hugging May. &quot;See you tomorrow night.&quot;

May was slightly startled. It was the second time Rally had hugged her 
this night... but this time she noticed something about her friend. &#145;Her 
body... it&#39;s so cold!&#39; Recovering, she returned the hug and said, &quot;You 
too.&quot; May then boarded the Rolls, which Walter proceeded to drive off.

Rally spent several seconds watching the car depart, then turned back to 
the mansion. &#145;She flinched when I hugged her,&#39; she thought to herself. 
&#145;I guess she doesn&#39;t truly understand what it means to be me yet.&#39; As 
soon as she entered, she noticed Seras standing in the hallway near the 
stairs to the sub-basement levels. &quot;I&#39;m going to have to get that report 
ready for tomorrow night, Master,&quot; Rally began. &quot;Sir Integra&#39;s going to 
need it to present to the Queen.&quot;

&quot;Rally... what about Kenny?&quot; the blonde vampire asked. &quot;When he 
collapsed back in that alley, you said you&#39;ll tell me about it.&quot;

Rally stopped. &quot;Oh, I did.&quot; Smiling, she leaned against the stair rail 
and began. &quot;Kenny&#39;s got multiple sclorosis. That&#39;s what caused his 
collapse.&quot;

&quot;I... didn&#39;t realize that,&quot; Seras gasped, shocked.

&quot;Look... as long as Kenny&#39;s still healthy, I&#39;m alright,&quot; Rally 
continued. &quot;But one of these days his coordination will deteriorate to 
the point that he cant handle explosives. I guess that was why he and 
May set-up the demo company... just to say close when that day comes.&quot;

&quot;Well, from the looks of it, I say those two will do just fine,&quot; Seras 
added. Giving Rally a peck on the cheek, she added, &quot;Come, I&#39;ll help you 
out on that report.&quot;

&quot;Thanks... and Master... I&#39;ve got a little favor to ask?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

Rally looked Seras squarely in the eye and said, &quot;Do you think that... 
just for tonight... you can bring my coffin out of storage and put it in 
our room?&quot;

&quot;Why on earth for?&quot;

&quot;May deserves to know the truth about me,&quot; was all Rally said.</pre>
