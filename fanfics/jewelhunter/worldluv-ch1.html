<h1>Two Worlds, One Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../jewelhunter/index.html">Jewel BEM Hunter Lime</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dragonhealer.html">Dragonhealer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>She sat on the couch, nervous and eagerly waiting for her arrival.  
After collecting all the six gems, she and Bass returned to the 
magical world, but Lime then realized that she would have to explain 
to Mizuki that sad news.  Mizuki, the only true friend Lime ever had, 
and in the human world.  No matter where they were or what they did, 
she was always there.  It was tough, but their mission was completed.  
Lime just could not leave Mizuki without telling her anything.  That 
weekend, she had called her over to spend the night at her apartment.  
As usual, Mizuki was thrilled.  Hearing her excitment crushed Lime.  
It made her heart stop.

Lately she noticed that she could not stop thinking about her.  As she 
sat on the couch she thought over of how she was going to break the 
news to her.  On the phone she managed to tell Mizuki that Bass had 
gone back home, so it was those two together.  She remembered her 
first day at school, where she met Mizuki.  She was her first friend.  
When she shared her lunch with her, when she told her about the BEM 
monster that was asking girls for their bras.  Her laugh.  Her 
beautiful face.  Her beautiful eyes.  Her sweet and caring 
personality.  So pure.....so innocent.  She hardly suspected that Lime 
and Bass were not human.  Lime felt a sharp twinge deep within her 
heart.  She suddenly realized just how much Mizuki meant to her.  
Aside from searching for the monsters, she had gained many happy 
memories from being with Mizuki Seo.

That was when Lime made her decision.  She was going to tell her the 
truth. 

When she realized how much she felt about Mizuki, she often felt 
guilty that she had to keep her actual identity a secret.  But she had 
to leave soon.  &lt;If I tell her, she might think I have been deceiving 
her.  No, she would never think that way, would she?  Oh no.......is 
it true?   Am I falling in love with her?  Why here?   Why in the 
human world and not my own?&gt;  The poor transformer felt torn between 
returning home and seeing Mizuki&#39;s pretty face again.

She was wearing a white T-shirt and jeans.  She looked out the window.  
It was a beautiful evening, the sky a bright orange and a few clouds.  
There was a sunset just outside her apartment window.  Just looking at 
it made her feel peaceful and calm.  It took her a heck of a long time 
to convince Bass to stay behind.  She would have resorted to more 
drastic measures had he not agreed.  He was finally able to understand 
that she wanted to do this alone.  The sunset reminded her of 
someone....&lt;That&#39;s right.  It reminds me of Mizuki.  The same 
colors.....&gt;

The doorbell rang.  She whirled her head, her heart beginning to beat 
furiously, faster than she could count.  Taking a deep breath, she 
stood up and calmly walked towards the door.  &quot;I.....I&#39;m coming,&quot; her 
voice cracking a little.  She opened the door and there stood a 
smiling Mizuki, carrying a bag.  Seeing her made Lime want to break 
down and cry.  Mizuki hardly noticed how nervous Lime was.  &quot;I&#39;m so 
glad you invited me over to spend the night.  This is going to be so 
exciting.&quot;  The wonderful sound of her sweet voice made Lime&#39;s stomach 
churn inside-out.  It was more than she could bear.  &lt;She&#39;s so kind to 
me.  Even though we&#39;re from two different worlds.....no, she doesn&#39;t 
know that.   It&#39;s my fault that I never told her.&gt;

Mizuki began to notice that something was wrong, aside from the fact 
that Lime stood frozen.  &quot;Lime, is something wrong?  You&#39;re shaking.  
Maybe you should sit down.&quot;  She took a step closer.  &lt;I need to let 
her know how I feel.&gt;   Seeing her worried expression, Lime felt a 
burning sensation deep within her.  Finally, she snapped.  She pulled 
Mizuki inside, slammed the door shut, and pressed her lips firmly 
against Mizuki&#39;s, hugging her tightly.  Dropping the bag, Mizuki 
closed her eyes and melted into the kiss.  &lt;Her lips are so 
soft.....so warm....oh Lime, what does this mean?&gt;

An hour later, soft moans were heard from behind Lime&#39;s bedroom door.  
The two girls were in Lime&#39;s bed, naked and beneath her sheets.  They 
locked eyes, their faces returning to normal.  Finally, Mizuki spoke 
up, &quot;So it&#39;s true after all.  You and Bass are from another world.&quot;  
Lime slowly nodded her head, than moved in closer than kissed her 
passionately.

&quot;I love you, Mizuki.  You make me feel so alive.  You were always 
there for me, always there to help me out.  You were my first friend.  
When I was lost you were there.  I just had to see your beautiful face 
again,&quot; she spoke softly.

Mizuki smiled and blushed.  &quot;I always had the same feelings for you, 
Lime.  I knew you were special when I met you.  I liked you right 
away.  You were strong.  I love you, too.&quot;

Lime nuzzled her face into her neck, then whispered into her ear, 
&quot;Ever since I met you, you were always on my mind.  When Bass and I 
were battling a monster, you face was always appearing in my mind.  I 
felt I was fighting for you.  When I saw your face all the worries I 
ever had about finding the gems disappeared.  You&#39;re the sunset to me.  
I&#39;m glad I met you, Mizuki.&quot;

&quot;Lime.....&quot; Mizuki moaned softly as Lime gently kissed her neck.  Lime 
cupped her face with her hands and kissed her softly.  &quot;You smell so 
good,&quot; Lime spoke softly as she looked into Mizuki&#39;s beautiful brown 
eyes.  &quot;I see my world when I look into your eyes.&quot;

&quot;Then your world must be a wonderful place.  I&#39;m sorry that you have 
to leave.  You were my best friend,&quot; Mizuki said as she ran her 
fingers through Lime&#39;s soft hair.

&quot;I still am.  I will always be here for you.  I won&#39;t ever hide 
anything else from you.  I will come back and see you again.  Nothing 
in the magical world can ever restrain me from seeing your beautiful 
face again,&quot; she spoke softly.

&quot;And I will always be here waiting for you.  Whether it rains or if 
it&#39;s sunny.  I will be waiting.&quot;

&quot;Always,&quot; Lime continued whispering in her ear as her hands explored 
more of Mizuki&#39;s body beneath the sheets.  When she looked at Mizuki 
again she was surprised to find her eyes filling with tears.  
&quot;Mizuki......&quot;

She was smiling.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Lime.  I know you will come back to me.  
I just can&#39;t help it.&quot;  She closed her eyes as Lime gently wiped them 
away.  She kissed her deeply and moved her hands lower.

&quot;Oh...Lime,&quot; Mizuki moaned as Lime&#39;s delicate hands pleased her body.  
She could feel her body getting more and more warmed up.

&quot;Mizuki, about what we did earlier, I want to do it again with you 
before I have to leave,&quot; she whispered, and kissed her ear.

&quot;Yes, Lime.  As do I.  I won&#39;t ever leave you until then.  Let me feel 
your body,&quot; Mizuki said in a sweet voice as she touched Lime&#39;s body.

Lime had never felt so pleased in her life.  She moaned in pleasure.  
&quot;Mizuki, I never knew you could.....&quot;

Mizuki giggled.  &quot;You haven&#39;t seen anything else yet,&quot; she said in a 
mysterious voice.  More intense moaning and ragged breathing were 
heard throughout the night.

When Mizuki woke up the next morning, she found herself alone.  
Picking up her clothes that were tossed on the floor, she discovered a 
note on the pile.  It was sparkling with a magical aura around it.  
When she picked it up she immediately felt a warm sensation.  The note 
read,

&quot;Two worlds, one love.  What does it matter?  No matter where I go or 
what I do, you will always be on my mind.  Nothing, not even the 
magical gems, compare to you.  You are my jewel, my love, my sunset.  
Keep this note.  Whenever you have it with you we will be spiritually 
connected.  We will know what the other is thinking.  Please be 
waiting for me.  I love you.&quot; 
Lime

Tears of joy welled up in Mizuki&#39;s eyes. She clutched the note and 
held against her chest.  &quot;And I&#39;ll be here waiting for you,&quot; she 
whispered.  When she opened her eyes she saw the most beautiful 
sunrise just out the window.
