<h1>Please Teachers, Two</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../onegaiteacher/index.html">Onegai Teacher!</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/wdv.html">WdV</a><br> </h2>
<p>	Ichigo Marino was sure she seen what she thought she seen and was on her way to 
confront Mizuho about it.  Marie was setting on Mizuho’s shoulder and they just vanished in 
a flash of light. Ichigo thought there might be a little more to this than what she just 
seen and she was on her way to find out.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>	Ichigo was trailing Mizuho but out of sight behind her. She followed her to the same 
place she had lost her before three times already where she seemed to just disappear here so 
she was going to get up behind her real close.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Maybe be in the same area that seemed to be transferring her someplace. Ichigo was 
within touching her when she heard her say something to Marie there on her shoulder when all 
of a sudden they all left that place to end up in a huge room with all kinds of electronics 
and gauges of some sort and a whining noise but very faint in another part of this place, 
what ever it was?</p>

<p>	About then Mizuho turned right into her standing there almost petrified with 
disbelief of where she ended up at and seemed to be right at home to Mizuho starring at her 
there now.</p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	Mizuho was as surprised to see Ichigo as Ichigo was to see Mizuho as they looked 
into each others eyes. Ichigo was first to say, “What’s up teach?” </p>

<p>	 Mizuho was quick to answer with,” What are you doing here anyway, how did you get 
here?” </p>

<p>	Ichigo smiled as she said, “Well I followed you here, and how did you get here 
anyway?” </p>

<p>	 Mizuho looked at Ichigo real close, said, “Well I get here with my ships control, 
Marie here which is the control to my whole ship here. Now that you’ve seen it, you might as 
well get the first hand tour as well then too. </p>

<p>	Ichigo ask, “Well just what kind of ship is this then, we weren’t near any water at 
the time you know? </p>
<p>	Mizuho just smiled a second then said, “Well we don’t need to be near the water to 
be transported here from anywhere else, just follow me.” </p>

<p>	Ichigo wasn’t letting Mizuho get too far ahead of her for fear of getting lost in 
one of the long halls that seem to be going from where they were going to. </p>

<p>	Mizuho stopped to show Ichigo the small but complex control panel that Marie just 
flew to and set down on, said, “Marie really is my portable control to my ship here.”</p>

<p>	Ichigo was amazed at the awesome and wonder of everything in here but ask again, 
“Well just what kind of ship is this then or am I too afraid to ask now?” </p>

<p>	Mizuho laughed to say, “Well this is a space craft and I’m really an Alien from a 
planet a long ways from here, well half Alien and half human from this planet and I’m here 
to see the place where my father is from to be exact.” </p>

<p>	A smile now erased the questioned face of Ichigo as she ask, “Were you a teacher 
where you came from then? You are a real teacher for us here even if you are from someplace 
else and I don’t doubt you one bit with all the strange things happening where you are all 
the time. Just how big is your ship anyway?” </p>

<p>	Mizuho answered, “Well it would take up three football fields and then still leave 
some room but enough about my ship, what about you here now, were you following me and why, 
not many students follow their teachers, it’s more like we teachers follow our students to 
keep them in line but you don’t need followed. You are a model student to start with and 
good grades. Why are you following me and to here in my ship as well?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Ichigo blushed a little as she said, “Well I was setting on the park bench the first 
time I saw you just disappear in thin air and you showed up in class the next day so I knew 
there was something strange with you so I followed you to the place as before and you 
disappeared again.</p>

<p>	 I followed you again the next day and you vanished again in the same place so today 
I stayed real close to you when you got to that spot and here I am with you this time. </p>

<p>	Of course I never thought I’d be in a ship like yours here, gee this is a nice 
hiding place if you want to get away from someone real quick, this is neat.” </p>

<p>	</p>
<p>	Mizuho smiled as she flipped a few switches on the panel, said, “This ship is tamper 
proof from the outside but I have to transport in to check up on things about once a day and 
that’s the only way anyone can get in here is to teleport and I don’t think anyone else has 
a transporter on earth so I’m safe there.</p>

<p>	 But you now, what are we going to do with you here that you’ve seen everything I’ve 
tried to hide from the rest of the world so far? I guess I could erase your memory but that 
don’t seem to work on some people here on earth so what then?” </p>

<p>	Ichigo smiled back, said, “Well I am good at keeping a secret if you would like but 
I would like to get a complete tour of your ship if I could please. If I’m going to keep a 
secret then let it be a big one, Ok?”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>	Mizuho took Ichigo’s hand in hers and said, “Well let’s go then as I have to get 
back sometime today to my 3:00 class so we have about three hours to look now and you do 
have to get home sometime today anyway, right?”</p>

<p>	Ichigo looked down kind of as she said, “I live alone so I don’t have anywhere to be 
any special time. My parents and I don’t live together because of my health problem. It or I 
embarrass them too much so I live alone, sorry.”</p>
<p>	 </p>
<p>	Mizuho said, “I’m sorry, I do know of your health problem as I am your home room 
teacher and we do have to know of certain health problems that some students may have.”</p>

<p>	“I know that you want it kept secret so I never even brought it up to you either. 
It’s strange that you in earth years are older than I am with me in my planets years so I 
should be looking up to you in some ways.”</p>

<p>	“I knew right away that there was something wrong with you speaking so knowledgeable 
and straight forward in everything you say and with authority as well. You were different 
but in a good way.”</p>

<p>	Ichigo smiled as she said, “Well I knew I was older than you and I really like you, 
that’s why I started drawing little hearts on my papers thinking you might get the idea some 
day but that never happened.” </p>
<p>	</p>
<p>	“I started making little mistakes and you kept correcting them and not said a word 
to me about them, then I didn’t know what to do next. Then I saw you disappear that day, I 
knew you were special and not only to me either.” </p>

<p>	“I know I fell in love with you that day but I knew I’d never get that love in 
return so I put it in the back of my mind, sorry for letting you know but you are very 
special to me but I can only watch you from a far too. I know that I may never be loved by 
anybody that really could love me in my health state.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>	Mizuho took Ichigo’s hand, said, “But Ichigo, what if I said I had a cure for your 
health problem and I think your smaller size is real cute, I knew you were older and I even 
thought that what if some time we could get together and discus your problem health and let 
you know all of this then.” </p>

<p>	“Would you let me help you with our medical knowledge far beyond yours here on 
earth, would you let me help you for me then if you like me as well? I know for sure I 
really like you. I‘ve had my eyes on you for a few months now and that I find you been 
watching me to, why not then as two girls together are common on our planet anyway.” </p>

<p>	Ichigo smiled again as she took Mizuho’s hand into hers now, said, “Well I guess we 
could discus politics or something for a couple of hours don’t you think? Do you have a bed 
in this huge ship then or will that big lay down chair there do now?”</p>

<p>	 Mizuho smiled, said, “One room down this way” as she headed them in a new direction 
this time. They walked into this huge room that had the largest bed Ichigo could ever 
imagine being in a single room. </p>

<p>	Ichigo ask, “Mizuho, why such a large bed anyway, thirty people could sleep on it 
comfortable and not be close to one another you know?” </p>

<p>	Mizuho laughed as she led Ichigo to the bed, said, “Well I roll around a lot in my 
sleep sometimes but I don’t think we have sleep in mind now do we?” </p>

<p>	Ichigo smiled but ask, “What about my seizures? I don’t want to have one while we’re 
doing something important here now do I?”</p>

<p>	 Mizuho said, “I looked up the cause of them and found they are caused by a will or 
desire to be free of the present situation so you don’t worry about them to the point of a 
seizure that you don’t want to have anyway so it’s kind of a chain reaction anyway. But I 
will cure you anyway with my portable doctor right now so we don’t worry about that, 
Ok?”</p>

<p>	 Mizuho took a small object like a hair brush and waved it over Ichigo’s head a 
couple of times, said, “I think that’ll do the job. It put all you brain molecules in one 
direction so the seizures don’t have a chance to start even so you should be cured for your 
life time now, Ok?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>	Ichigo ask, “We will be ok to do what ever now, right? There are a number of things 
I want to try with you now as none of my school friends are old enough legal wise to try any 
of it so I might even teach you a few things here teach if you don’t mind being taught by 
me?”</p>

<p>	Mizuho gently lay Ichigo back on the bed and they begin a student teaching teacher a 
few things about love here on earth with a young lady that knew a lot about life already, 
just hadn’t done any of it until now and she proved to be an excellent teacher also teacher 
said later that day after they had teleported back to the present and the place they left 
from. </p>

<p>	For the first time to them to say to each other kind of, that a very special love 
had just formed between the two teacher and student, student and teacher and for others to 
just wonder why they were walking together and too close but the way they looked and smiled 
at each other should have hinted to it all. </p>

<p>	Ichigo ask, “Would you like to come over to my place after you get through with your 
3:00 class, I’ll wait for you, I just might have a few more lessons we could work on if you 
would like?”</p>

<p>	Didn’t take Mizuho but a second to say, “Yes Ichigo, I would love too see just how 
you live and all alone. We could spend time together at the others place every day or so, I 
really love some things you taught me/us and they were real mind and body pleasers for me as 
well as that kind of activity is a daily thing where I came from, I just wasn’t old enough 
when I left there to get married let alone have a girl friend to do it with then.”</p>

<p>	Ichigo’s hand took Mizuho’s hand but just for a second so no one would suspect 
anything any different from the two teacher and student conversation there in the hall, 
said, “Well you’re old enough now and that once a day sounds perfect to me.”</p>

<p>	 “I know that I am in love with you even as of today but it really happened a while 
back when you ask me to help you grade papers and that I could have graded my own even but 
you seemed to trust me even then and that really got me.” </p>

<p>	“You trusted me when all the other teachers thought I was different but in a strange 
way and most didn’t even want to talk to me one on one. Your trust means a lot to me Mizuho, 
thanks and I‘ll be glad to see you everyday after school, that will be great.”</p>

<p>	Mizuho smiled as she bumped shoulders with Ichigo, said, “Well for 4:30 today then, 
which, your place or mine. If it’s mine we have to meet at our demarcation point but I can 
transport you to my ship from anyplace if I know where you’ll be at that time anyway but 
it’s best to be together.” </p>

<p>	“I want to be with you as much as possible because I am falling in love with you 
more as we speak, you are so cute Ichigo, God, anyone would be happy to be with you, and I 
just don’t understand most people here on earth, never satisfied with what they got or what 
they could get if they just try?” </p>

<p>	Ichigo said, “Your place and I’ll just follow you a ways back until we get to our 
vanishing point, I’ll be right behind you because I’m not letting you out of my sight 
Mizuho, you trust me with your secret and I really thank you for it.”</p>

<p>	 “I love you so much for that alone but there is a lot more of you to love than 
that. I love your beautiful body with proportions I’ll never have, we would make great 
opposites but love is what I want to make with you, I do love you so.” </p>
<p>              </p>

<p>	Mizuho just smiled at Ichigo this time, said, “Tonight then I have a surprise for 
you and I know for sure that you’ll love this one so until we meet at our place of 
evaporation, you have a good afternoon then, love ya Ichigo, I really 
do.”---------------------</p>

<p>	Ichigo was right behind Mizuho when they teleported to her ship and the two walked 
hand and hand to where Mizuho wanted to show her new found lover the real surprise of her 
life now. Mizuho said, “Set here in my control chair to see this, I know you’ll just love me 
for it too.” </p>

<p>	Mizuho told Marie on her shoulder a couple of commands and the next thing Ichigo 
knew, she was looking down at the earth from about the moons distance and the earth looked 
so small from there looking out the front of the ship. Ichigo looked out to the side view to 
see them almost on the surface of the moon and it looked so bright there on top of it. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>	Ichigo squeezed Mizuho’s hand, said, “This is the most beautiful sight I’ve ever 
seen, I thank you so much for this wonderful view that I’d never be able to describe to 
anyone on earth ever.” </p>

<p>	She looked at Mizuho setting in the captains chair beside her with a very questioned 
look on her face, ask, “You know that I’ve never ask you where this ship is kept on earth, 
it’s so big, we could walk for two blocks and not get to the front it, it looks like.”</p>

<p>	Mizuho smiled, said, “In the lake because no place else is big enough.” She pointed 
behind them as she helped Ichigo up and turn them both around to smile again and say, “Well 
we don’t have to walk two blocks to love each other and I’m sure it’s never been done this 
high either, you and I will be the first.”</p>

<p>	 She led Ichigo to the convenient bed there, set and they lay to a new love and 
outlook on life for both. A new start as they cuddled in arms to a hug and kiss both was 
more than ready for. </p>

<p>	Mizuho said between kisses, “you won’t be alone anymore Ichigo my love, and you make 
me feel wanted again because I was almost an outcast from my home for wanting to come to 
earth to live, this is heaven to me. I know we‘re going to have a meaningful and lasting 
relationship together Ichigo my love.”</p>

<p>	Ichigo smiled as her hand gently messaged Mizuho’s ample chest size to say, “Yes I 
do believe so Mizuho love. I would never have guessed we’d ever be doing this here now, I 
love you so much my sweet teacher, my love, thank you for loving me.”</p>

<p>	The long weekend started for them and neither would be lonely again. </p>
