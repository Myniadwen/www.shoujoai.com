<h1>Iron Head (Don't Look Back in Anger)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../yotoden/index.html">Yotoden</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>...Sakon once asked me something.

He said so clearly;

&quot;Why do you fight?&quot;

To humour the age old ideal of good versus evil one might expect 
me to answer with air of self-righteousness. To say that I 
risked my life for the greater good. That I fought constantly 
and with no regard for my personal safety because in some way; I 
view my life as less than those of others. To believe that was 
the case... would be right. But not one single facet of my life 
is devoted to one thing. Far least my will to stop dead the 
machinations of Oda Nobunaga. Such a desire has roots in more 
than one plot of soil. I fought not only to stop a madman who 
was laying waste to the shinobi order; but for personal reasons 
of my own. Those reasons are simple. 

I fought out of anger and vengeance.

I remember once when Ryoma and I spoke with Lord Momochi of the 
Iga Clan. Before the betrayal of Kayo and the Koga, a result of 
the actions of the Seven Oboro. He had told me that when he 
first met me; he was surprised. To have seen a kunoichi so 
powerful. A kunoichi that was powerful enough to escape the 
ruins of the Kasumi Clan. One comment of his really stuck with 
me. Ryoma claimed that it was &#39;amazing&#39; that I could have 
escaped that nightmare without so much as a scratch upon my 
will. I greatly suspect that I was somewhat flattered back then. 
But now... I question that. 

...When I emerged from the flames of the Kasumi Clan compound, I 
was given the duty of carrying the message of our destruction to 
Hagakure and Hyuga. It was thought that our union would be 
enough to quell the pretensions and bloodshed of the Oboro and 
the forces of darkness. But I was also given a deeper duty. 

To use and defend the fabled Kodachi that became deeply attached 
to the legacy that my clan was wielding. The sword that I use 
now. The sword of legend. One third of the three swords that 
will unite to fulfil the prophecy of Yotoden. That was why my 
Father sacrificed his life to protect the sword. That was why my 
Brother sacrificed his life to allow me to escape the fire of 
destruction. To keep the wheel of hope turning. To entrust the 
sword to me. So that I might use it to fulfil the prophecy. And 
ensure the safety of the ninja legacy. 

And so I forsook all that I was. 

Woman, Heir, Future Mother.

All those dreams and responsibilities that were given to the 
women of Kasumi were rejected in my heart for the greatest 
possible task that I could have endured. To stop Nobunaga and 
the Oburo by bringing about Yotoden. But at that time... I was 
blinded to my true will. I was never moved my a sentiment of 
protection or caring for those less able to protect themselves 
as me. As selfish as it was... I wanted revenge. Even if it 
meant dying for it. All I wanted was to avenge the deaths of my 
family. To avenge the death of the Kasumi Clan. To avenge the 
death of my life as a woman. 

Without the reflections of Gobo and the insight of Sakon, I 
might very well have ended as another corpse upon the filthily 
rising pile created by the whims of Nobunaga. And though I value 
all of what they have given me, in particular Sakon, I would not 
have returned to my true path unless it were for her. 

And my heart still aches simply to think of her.

Lady Kikyo. 

Even before the attack Ryoma and I laid upon Azuchi Castle, I 
thought of her. I thought of her elongated tresses of cinnamon 
brown, her dark golden eyes, her sweet voice. Her air of purity 
and dignity. I thought of such thing every day since her death. 
Kikyo was unlike anyone I had ever seen before. When I first 
entered Hagakure, after meeting Ryoma and his followers in the 
outer forests, I saw her. I was so allured. Though her beauty 
struck me, I was confused as to how such a kind, caring woman 
had been sculpted within the walls of such a powerful ninja 
clan. And though the defences of the Hagakure Compound were a 
bigger agenda on my mind at the time... I soon saw her for what 
she was. And for what I saw of my old self in her. 

When I looked into her eyes... I truly saw my old self.

Not as the remaining Shadow of the Kasumi Clan, not as the 
wielder of the short sword, but as a woman. What I was fated to 
do then was irrelevant. I was happy then. And to look into 
Kikyo&#39;s eyes and reflect upon those days...

...Well, it makes it easy to see why I fell in love with her.

No better time did I feel that than when I went to the gardens 
of the Hagakure. By the banks of the stream I sat and I 
ruminated on its beauty. The gleam of the water in the 
moonlight, the romantic glow of the fireflies. Those were the 
sights that made me think back to Kasumi. I thought back to the 
times I stare at the fireflies at home. And how my Brother would 
always carry me home when I was too upset to leave. I even to 
Kikyo as much. The flood of emotions came thereafter. Leaving me 
with the kind of feminine frailty of emotion that I was seeking 
to rid myself of to complete my mission. 

My Father probably would have regarded my tears as &#39;a sign of 
female weakness&#39;...

...Kikyo called them &#39;an expression of who you truly are&#39; when 
we spoke then. 

And when she told me that I could have melted there and then. 
Misogynistic as my Father was; he was correct about my tears 
being symbols of weakness. But to hear Kikyo to say what she 
said made me feel different about everything for the first time 
since I witnessed the death of all my loved ones at Kasumi. Her 
words showed me that I needed to be who I was when the time was 
right. The masculine persona I needed to develop to command 
respect amongst my peers and to fulfil the prophecy did not need 
to rule my life. Just as Sakon argued. 

And from that moment on I knew how I felt about her. Attraction 
was something I could very easily bury. Love is something 
entirely different. My feelings for Kikyo grew all at once. But 
if frailty of emotion was my feminine weakness, then an 
inability to express emotion was my masculine one. 

I couldn&#39;t speak a word of what I felt.

In some respects... I know that Kikyo loved me too. For what she 
did, for what she said, and for how she acted, I am sure of it. 
But we were both women by birth... even though some might class 
me as male by spirit. Such relationships might not have been 
swallowed well by others, even though noble lords often indulged 
in relations with the same sex. It was even rumoured that that 
Mori Ranmaru, the force behind all of the nightmare, was the 
bedfellow of his lord, Nobunaga. After meeting that monster I 
can assuredly say that this was not the case. Ranmaru held far 
too much contempt for that old parasite to allow his corrupted 
fingers to lay upon him. But regardless of that... feelings 
between woman and woman, man and man, were frowned upon. The 
fact that I suspected silenced Kikyo as well as me. 

Which ironically made our short time together so bitter sweet. 

Kikyo didn&#39;t try to tell me what she felt until it was too late. 
And the same went for me. Just after we spoke at the firefly 
gardens; Hagakure was under attack from the Oboro and their 
lesser demons. Ryoma and all his Father&#39;s forces rallied 
together, along with Sakon, in order to expel the devils. As 
well as the one commanding the attack. The Oboro who carried as 
much hatred from me as Nobunaga did. 

Saebusa Jinnai.

Just as I felt weak-hearted to think of Kikyo, I feel utter 
anger at the name of Jinnai. The foul monster behind the 
destruction of Kasumi and the ruination of Hagakure. The one to 
took my life from me. The moment I saw him rear his face inside 
the compound, I instantly went to meet with him upon its walls. 
I recall him saying that he &#39;had no words for the dying&#39; when I 
vented my fury at his actions. And when we battled I lost to 
much concentration to my anger. When I fell off the edge of the 
wall, I had to throw my grappling hook around him and drag him 
down with me to smother the fall. I was successful. And I 
thought that that would be the end of him. Which caused me to 
pay more attention to the fact that Kikyo was coming my way. I 
could remember how she looked both happy and frightened when she 
embraced me. Happy to see me alive from the fall... and 
frightened about what she thought nearly befell me. Such a time 
confirmed my feelings for her. To know that a woman that I 
hadn&#39;t known all that long would be so worried for my safety.

Kikyo&#39;s endless love was so obvious back then. 

But to my disbelief, Saebusa was not dead. And was still out for 
blood. I can remember Kikyo turning around me and shielding my 
back as the Oboro shot something towards us. His claw. It lodged 
into her back. And instantly threw a kunai back into his face 
when I saw him do this. Which again did not destroy him. But by 
that time my concerns were not for Saebusa. Only for the woman 
whom had captured my heart so effortlessly as I began my 
journey. She was dying. I tried to kid myself into believing 
that she would make it. After all there were so many ninja 
potions and treatments that could have been used to help her. 
But she was dying. And it was at that point when Kikyo, 
breathless, chest heaving, voice weakening, told me that I had 
to continue the fight. That she was &#39;holding me back&#39;. Never 
have I heard such foolish words from someone I valued to such a 
degree. And yet never have I heard such words that confirm such 
a sort of relentless kindness and dignity. 

For a woman who saved my life to actually believe that she was a 
detriment to me... I was unbelievable. I was never my angry at 
her. And never more sure of my feelings for her, either. And 
when she released her dying breath, I realized that was too late 
to even present what I felt. 

Kikyo was gone. 

Gone before I could say what I wanted to. Thank her for what she 
did for me. Stress the facts that had been made so clear thanks 
to her. It was all so hopeless. So when I laid her to rest, I 
made my resolve solid. As the cannons blasted the great monster 
that Saebusa had transformed himself into and the flames roared 
in the night sky, I knew that I had to do what I could to 
destroy it. To destroy the fiend that caused so much suffering 
and death. To unhinge the foundations of Nobunaga&#39;s rule and 
bring peace to a nation so ridden with warfare and violence. 
Even if it killed me. It was the act that cause me to unlock the 
truest power of my sword. And shatter the first Oboro, Saebusa 
Jinnai, into the former dust of his creation. 

Once the violence had settled, and what remained of Hagakure was 
safe, I was left with nothing but a dull ache in my chest. The 
pains and weight of loss was made so brutally apparent to me. 
And as the rain came down with such cleansing agony, I cried 
again. But not with regrets. I cried as an expression of who I 
was. Who I really was. Something that Kikyo had taught me to do 
so well. 

Once we buried her, we began the hunt for union. One part of my 
duty had been fulfilled. I had made Hagakure aware of the 
situation, even if I could not do so with Hyuga. Iga, Koga and 
other lesser ninja establishments had to be informed. Then we 
could unite and take up the fight against Nobunaga and the Oboro 
with all our strength. And eventually, we were successful. After 
defeating the last of the Oboro, Nobunaga, and then later 
Ranmaru, the void to the dark realm was sealed forever. 

The prophecy of Yotoden was fulfilled. 

And a new lord took over where Nobunaga had left his mark. But 
to the dance of an unambiguous tune. One of relative peace. When 
Sakon died in my arms on that day, I took him to the ruins of 
Hyuga to be buried as a thanks for all the gifts he had given 
me. I would have done the same for Ryoma at Hagakure but there 
was no trace of him. In winning my fight I had lost so much. But 
with all that I lost, I ensured so much more for others. Soon 
afterwards I committed myself to the rebuilding of Kasumi. I was 
the last one left in knowledge of our Clan&#39;s ninjutsu style. But 
I began passing it down to newer generations in the hopes that 
they would use the style to defend our peace and freedom. 

It is a lot of work.

But every now and again I go back to Hagakure and visit the site 
of Kikyo&#39;s burial. Which is where I am now. I crouch down and 
place a selection of flowers upon her grave. And think back to 
my short times with the woman who put my misguided heart back on 
course. I thank her for these things. But I doubt that I could 
ever truly be thankful enough.

&quot;Now the fight is over,&quot; I say to her grave, &quot;I have so much to 
do to rebuild Kasumi. But with the aid of other ninja bodies... 
I can restore it, Kikyo. I don&#39;t want the memories of all our 
scarifies to be forgotten. I want my clan to be a footnote in 
the legacy of what can be obtained when human spirit is forced 
to stand in defiance of tyranny. And we will do the same for the 
Hagakure. I know you would have wanted that. One day I will join 
you in the next life and we will be reunited. Then you can see 
all that has become of the new world we all hoped to build. 
Until then, rest peacefully.&quot;

And so I stand and walk into the sun of a new era. The events 
around the death of Kikyo, Sakon, Ryoma and all others are over. 
But not forgotten. I will carry out all their hopes into 
fruition. That, in truth, is why I fought. Revenge and the 
fulfilment of destiny are chief motivations for it. But there is 
one reason that stands above all others. The very same gift that 
Kikyo truly brought out in me.

...Hope.

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts

* My first and probably last Yotoden fanfiction. A short piece I 
cooked up after I thought about the Kikyo/Ayame relationship. I 
doubt that Kikyo had THAT much influence on Ayame, but I do feel 
that there was some form of romantic connection there. 

* Got any comments about what you just read? E-mail my about 
them!
