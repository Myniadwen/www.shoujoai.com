<h1>For You</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smj/index.html">Saber Marionette J</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	No matter where I go people always ask me the same 
thing. Why did I do it? How did I find the strength?

	And I always tell them that it was for them. That my actions 
were done for everyone&#39;s sake.

	But that&#39;s a lie, truly it is. Because deep down in my heart I 
know the real reason why I did what I did.

	It was for you.

	My own life didn&#39;t matter if yours didn&#39;t go on so risking it 
on your behalf hardly seemed like anything to me. I wonder if 
you&#39;ve ever realized that?

	I don&#39;t think you understood why I did it. If you did, then 
why did you come to save me?

	Save me... it was too late to save me at that point but still 
you tried. Just thinking of it is enough to make my heart burst from 
the emotion.

	Only you love me that much. Love me enough to sacrifice 
your own life in order to save my own. And yet, they&#39;re not the 
same. The emotions that you feel for me.

	I love you like you love him. And you?

	You love me like a sister, like a friend, like a comrade.

	I used to think that would be enough. That as long as I had 
some measure of your love I could somehow deal with your love 
for him and feel happy for you both.

	Unfortunately, things didn&#39;t turn out that way. Only a month 
had passed after my recovery when I found myself unable to take 
seeing the two of you together.

	It would be so much simpler if I could just hate him.

	I can&#39;t bring myself to do even that. He loves you as I do 
and I can hardly blame him for that. I can hardly blame him for 
being the one that you&#39;re in love with.

	A woman came to me the other day. Her name is Cecilia 
Knight and she wants my permission to write a book about me. 
About me and my adventures. And she wants me to help her with 
it... to tell her my thoughts on my life.

	An extraordinary life is how she described it.

	Today she asked me the question that everyone asks me. 
The question that I&#39;ve heard more often in my life than any other. 
And today I finally answered it honestly.

	When she asked me why I did it, why I risked my life and 
almost died to save Terra II, my reply was simple. 

	I said that it was for you.

	That it was for Lime.

The character of Marine is from Saber Marionette J Again. I&#39;ve 
always wanted to write a one shot dealing with Marine and her 
feelings for Lime so here it is. I hope any and all SMJ fans enjoyed 
this fic. There aren&#39;t enough fics for the series out there and I 
encourage anyone who likes the Anime to please write some. We 
SMJ fans need them!
