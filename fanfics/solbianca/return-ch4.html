<h1>Return to Dreams (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../solbianca/index.html">Sol Bianca</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakablonde.html">Bakablonde</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../solbianca/return-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>And so it had started that evening; Feb had been drinking ever since, 
some days more than others. The first few weeks she was there, April 
could hear her crying at night in her room. She&#39;d placed her next to her 
own bedroom, wanting to keep an eye on her, but afraid to go in and 
comfort her.

After a while the crying stopped, and then the fighting began. Tension 
and spats over just about anything- then Feb would get drunk, come in to 
her room, and fall asleep on her chest, just as she was now.

April ran her hand through Feb&#39;s thick hair and trailed her hand down to 
her face. The only time they seemed to be truly at peace with one 
another, the only time things really felt right, was when they lay here 
like this.

&quot;Why is that?&quot; April whispered, reaching for the remote to turn off the 
light. It was hard to move with the dead weight on her chest, and she 
felt Feb moan a little and tighten her grip.

&quot;Don&#39;t leave me.&quot; she whimpered, her voice thick from sleep.

&quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere, just turning off the light.&quot; April grunted out, 
finally locating the remote.

&quot;Promise me you won&#39;t leave me again.&quot; Feb murmured.

&quot;Leave you? I never left you. You&#39;re the one who ran away from the 
ship!&quot; April blurted out, and watched as Feb&#39;s head jerked up.

&quot;What?&quot; April asked. &quot;It&#39;s true. You&#39;re the one who left, not me.&quot;

Feb&#39;s eyes narrowed and she suddenly sat up, staring at April.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to leave the ship to be gone.&quot; She jumped up and headed 
for the door.

&quot;What the hell does that mean? Feb! Come back here!&quot; April tumbled 
angrily out of the bed. Feb didn&#39;t even bother to look back at her as 
she slammed the door. April threw the remote at the door and the lights 
blinked out. Cursing her way through the darkness, she stumbled to the 
door and into the hallway just in time to see Feb enter her room.

&quot;Goodnight April.&quot; Feb shot out as she ducked into her door. &quot;Sweet 
dreams.&quot;

&quot;Dammit Feb!&quot; April reached the door and shook the handle, knowing it 
would be locked.

&quot;You say some obscure shit about leaving, and then you go and leave me!&quot; 
April whirled and kicked the door. &quot;And you have the nerve to want me to 
make some promise to you?&quot;

&quot;Yea, I want you to promise to shut up!&quot; Jani yelled from down the 
hallway. April turned and saw Jani standing in her nightshirt, her hair 
sticking straight up.

Jun&#39;s door cracked open, and she peered out into the hall, an amused 
expression on her face.

&quot;Well, looks like things are back to normal.&quot; she smirked.

&quot;Very funny.&quot; April massaged her kicking foot.

&quot;Sure was a lot quieter without her here. Maybe you should have kept 
Percy and let her go after all.&quot; Jani snorted.

&quot;Maybe you should mind your own business!&quot; April shouted, then strode 
back to her room and slammed the door with a loud crack that echoed down 
the hallway.</pre>
