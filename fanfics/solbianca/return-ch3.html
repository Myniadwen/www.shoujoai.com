arms into the tub with an awkward splash.

&quot;It&#39;s okay...ow, ow....&quot; She hissed through her teeth as she sat in the 
water. Kneeling next to the tub, April noticed a faint trail of blood 
from between Feb&#39;s legs. &quot;Oh you&#39;ve got your period- I&#39;ll get you 
something for that.&quot; She went to stand but Feb pulled her back down.

&quot;It&#39;s not that, April. I was...&quot; she paused and looked down, her voice 
dropping to a whisper &quot;It&#39;s not from...that.&quot; she began to wash slowly, 
as April thought for a moment before the meaning of her statement took 
hold.

&quot;Bastards!&quot; April thudded her fist against the tub. &quot;I&#39;m glad we killed 
them all.&quot;

Feb said nothing, gingerly washing herself.

&quot;Look, if you think you need a doctor...Jun is pretty good at-&quot; she was 
interrupted as Feb dropped the cloth in the water and turned to her.

&quot;No! No. I don&#39;t want anyone else to touch me. Please.&quot;

&quot;Okay...okay.&quot; April held her hands up. &quot;It&#39;s ok. Look, I&#39;m going to go 
get you something to wear, will you be alright in here for a few 
minutes?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Feb looked up, and gave her a smile that caused April to grin 
back.

----------

She gave up on regular pajamas- Feb&#39;s legs were longer than hers, and 
she was so thin they would just fall off. &quot;She really needs to eat 
something.&quot; she muttered out loud, rummaging through the drawers. 
Finally she found a long slip that would have to do for now. Grabbing 
the slip and a bathrobe, she bundled them in her arms and headed back to 
the bathroom.

&quot;Well this is the best I could...Feb?&quot; she didn&#39;t see her. Suddenly she 
noticed a dark hand holding onto the side of the tub. With a distraught 
gasp, April dropped the clothes to the floor, flinging the upper half of 
her body over the tub wall. Splashing and gasping, she pulled Feb up to 
her and held her tightly.

&quot;Feb! Say something!&quot; April couldn&#39;t believe she&#39;d rescued the woman 
only to have her drown in her bathtub. &quot;Feb...&quot;

&quot;April.&quot; A voice was low in her ear. &quot;I was just rinsing my hair- not 
drowning.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; April exhaled deeply. &quot;Oh.&quot; She said again, suddenly feeling 
foolish.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Feb&#39;s mouth was in her hair, her long wet locks streaming 
down over the front of April&#39;s body. &quot;Thank you for saving me, April.&quot; 
Feb whispered, her lips brushing lightly against April&#39;s ear. A jolt 
shot through April&#39;s body and she made a small choking sound.

She meant to let her go, sliding her slowly away, feeling the soft skin 
of Feb&#39;s cheek slide over her own, but somehow, her head turned and 
suddenly their lips were together, pressing softly. An incredible surge 
took over April&#39;s body and she leaned forward, pressing Feb backward 
into the tub wall. Feb squealed into her mouth, breaking off the kiss.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; April blurted out, pulling away and struggling to regain 
her footing, and her composure. Why did I just do such a thing? I&#39;m 
acting like her captors on that ship. And I&#39;m not like that.

&quot;Feb, please, I&#39;m not like-&quot; she started, but Feb interrupted her, 
waving her hands.

&quot;I know.&quot; She lifted her head, and April thought she saw tears 
glistening in those emerald eyes. &quot;I know, April.&quot;

Oh what the hell have I done. Look at her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just want to help you. Tell me what you need.&quot; April 
busily dried herself off with a towel, avoiding eye contact.

&quot;I could use a drink.&quot; Feb softly sighed.</pre>
