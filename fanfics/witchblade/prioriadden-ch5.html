<h1>Priori Addendum (part 5 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../witchblade/index.html">Witchblade</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rpgingmaster.html">RPGing Master</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../witchblade/prioriadden-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><p>Charles Dickens prefaced “A Tale of Two Cities” with the immortal line,</p><p><i>“It was 
the best of times, it was the worst of times……”</i></p><p>Considering the situation that had 
resulted after Yuriko Mazaki had been taken to the Other Realm, it was definitely the worst 
of times, seeing as the cops arrived on the scene (with a frazzled Nakata leading the 
charge) not long after the ExCon was deader than dead (and gone, literally). One might 
wonder how the cops got the word of the incident, seeing as how Marry’s was in a commercial 
district where over 90% of the residents had homes far removed that they slept in at night, 
but the answer was simple enough.</p><p>While the ExCon incident itself miraculously escaped 
notice, seeing a miniature replay of the Aurora Borealis that filled the night sky and could 
be seen from space was hard to miss, and given that it happened RIGHT OVER the place where 
the resident superheroes lived the cops had thought it a good idea to check it out, and 
Nakata was denying himself even more sleep than he had already lost just to see what the 
blue hell had destroyed the idea of normalcy this time.</p><p>That said, the Witch Blades 
were both surprised and not surprised to see the cops show up, and since Reina was exhausted 
and Masane absent, Shiori walked outside to meet up with Nakata, who was by now giving her a 
“this better be good glare”.</p><p>With a summation that rivaled Commissar Ciaphas Cain in 
efficiently, she told his expectant face,</p><p>“ExCon battle. Killed it. Disposed of. 
Reason for light show.”</p><p>Nakata had been expecting to hear one long assed tale, so this 
was a surprise. In fact, Shiori, getting that, decided to elaborate,</p><p>“The fire is 
already out. Reina’s inside, exhausted from killing another ExCon. The light show was the 
Witch Blades bosses rapturing, so to speak, a Neogene we rescued."</p><p>Nakata exhaled at 
that point, as did the other cops, and Nakata asked, “Mind if we go inside so I can get your 
full report?” Without answering, Shiori walked over to the door of Marry’s, held it open, 
and even made a sweeping gesture like an usher welcoming guests to an upper crust dinner 
party.</p><p>Nakata took that as a yes.</p><p>From that point, Nakata actually did get to 
hear one “long assed tale”. They told him about Yuriko, the ExCon attack, and Darkness and 
Angelus taking her to their realm. At the last part, the portion of his brain that was 
“genre blind” kept yelling “KIDNAPPING!!!!!”, but the “genre savvy” portion, which held a 
majority of seats in the congress of his thought process, decided to take her words at face 
value, and merely asked for information on where the girl lived, so his troops could inform 
her close associates she had come to no harm.</p><p>Shiori provided the info, and just for 
the sake of following procedure, he interrogated all the witnesses, who all gave pretty much 
the same story, and said story gained even more credence when one of the older cops walked 
in, heard about the ExCon (and his woman hatred), and confirmed he had once busted the 
fucker (while alive and human) for assaulting a pregnant woman and almost cutting her 
stomach open, and as the incident with Yuriko and his physical description were recited back 
from Nakata’s notes, he was utterly convinced the Witch Blades had rendered one hell of a 
public service, and told his chief exactly that. That said, Nakata was extremely mollified, 
and the night’s excitement petered down. As the fuzz headed back for the station, Nakata 
resolved to file the last shreds of paperwork for the night and fuzz out on his newly 
acquired office couch.</p><p>As he left, Shiori went to check on Reina, who was currently as 
lively as a dishrag. Shiori and Maria helped the now woozy Reina upstairs, and helped her 
into bed. As they did, Shiori saw Maria give her almost insensate mother a hug and a peck on 
the cheek, and asked Shiori to tell her she was glad to have Reina as a mother. Shiori was 
so touched by this it was all she could do not to burst out the waterworks at the pure WAFF 
factor.</p><p>She was exhausted herself, and after shucking down to her undergarments, 
clambered into bed next to Reina, just glad she was alright.</p><p>Five minutes later, she 
found herself annoyed with her for the first time ever as she discovered Reina drooled in 
her sleep on her shoulder. That said, it was a minor annoyance at best, as considering that 
Reina had been and still was one of her primary reasons for breathing, she’d put up with 
anything, even that dictation habit of hers, which drove Shiori crazy, but thankfully not to 
the point it had earned her the fate of the jackass who decided it would be an outstanding 
idea to piss Reina-sama off.</p><p>As she prepared to turn in, she followed Maria’s example, 
and tenderly leaned over and kissed Reina’s other cheek, murmuring, “Aisheritu…………” before 
she passed out herself.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(The next morning)</p><p>The next morning 
started boring, but got interesting. Yuusuke staggered back to his room, eyes resembling 
holes cut in a cheap Halloween mask, and proceeded to pass out. He had been helping Kyoko 
organize the assloads of information the networks had on the events of the past two weeks, 
and considering she was senior editor for the network, she had to pare down all the raw TV 
news datum into sound bites and fit certain segments of journalistic revelations into 
periods ranging anywhere from three minutes, all the way up to three hours.</p><p>He had 
been helping her part time anyway, long before “The Battle of Tokyo”, as his earnings helped 
augment his ability to sufficiently pay his rent, but now he was helping her 24/7 mostly 
because he was a decent guy, the workload she had was obscene, and besides, she was a 
friend. Okay, maybe had been a lot more awhile back, and still was to some extent, but no 
matter what, he still cared for enough he didn’t mind throwing her a rope.</p><p>Over and 
over again.</p><p>As he hit the sheets, he was unaware that the manure had hit the 
rotational aperture device outside, as he had been cloistered in a dark room most of the 
night, helping Kyoko splice together stock footage for the next few days. As his eyes 
closed, he found himself oddly grateful and annoyed that even though he had achieved his 
dream of The Big Scoop, it had since cost him big time in sleep and sanity.</p><p>As he 
drifted off, another thought negated his gripes,</p><p>“<i>Oh, what the hell. I was able to 
tell the world the truth about a single mom who kicks evil in the balls till it goes 
sterile. I think the sacrifice is well worth it……………”</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>While 
Tozawa slept like a baby (even curling up in a ball and putting his thumb in his mouth at 
one point), the other girls got up. Or, in Reina’s case, tried to, but hit the floor with a 
dull thud. Thankfully, she wasn’t really hurt, just a little groggy still. Shiori helped her 
downstairs, where Rihoko (who was still unaware of the events of the previous night) was 
making breakfast. Asagi, Aoi, Maria, and Marry were already downstairs, and Reina was still 
too tired to notice that the young ladies wore cute pink bunny slippers with matching 
bathrobes (yes, even Asagi), and that Marry was currently looking at her, wondering if that 
undead thing the ExCons were had rubbed off on her a little.</p><p>That speculation died on 
the vine as breakfast was served, and Rihoko’s face assumed its first ever “WTF” look as her 
biological mother suddenly shed her laconic, demure demeanor and grabbed the American style 
bacon and eggs breakfast, and inhaled it. With her bare, unwashed hands.</p><p>She didn’t 
even wait for the “Itadakamisu” to be said yet!</p><p>That said the “WTF” look grew 
universal as Reina polished her plate in record time and made motions for more. Rihoko was 
obliging, wondering who the little Arquillan was inside a Reina Sohou lookalike robot, that 
was currently showing fewer table manners than Masane while drunk, seasick, and apparently 
working some not so legal medication out of her system. After the second plate, a bowl of 
miso soup drunk like Kool-Aid, and half a jug of milk, Reina finally slowed down, and it was 
obvious that whatever berserker rage had caused her to pig out uncontrollably had faded, as 
she now was blushing like a cherry and profusely apologizing for her disgraceful display in 
front of her kids and close friends.</p><p>As she did this, Shiori kept her mouth shut, mind 
still blown from Reina’s total OOC moment, and everyone else around the table was similarly 
shocked, with Asagi quipping,</p><p>“At least we know you’re a healthy eater.”</p><p>Reina 
was half tempted to give Asagi a poisonous look, but embarrassment was proving effective 
deterrence. Thankfully, the whole incident was not mentioned since, and Marry, who by now 
was assuming her business role as proprietor, told them it might be a good idea to let 
Masane know about what happened last night. The mental “D’oh!” would’ve made Homer Simpson 
feel way better about his IQ as the ladies scrambled for the phone, and Marry pulled an 
Asagi as she whistled for their attention and pointed to the one sitting less than five feet 
from her.</p><p>It was at that point irony decided to make a house call, as they saw 
Takayama’s car pull up outside.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(a few hours earlier)</p><p>Migura 
had been informed that the Witch Blades had destroyed another ExCon not long before now, 
courtesy of the police, and they immediately faxed this information over to his country 
villa. He read off the transcript of the events dispassionately, mind toying with some 
disturbing possibilities.</p><p>Angelus and Darkness had been violently opposed to the 
copying of the Witch Blade, hence their cooperation with their own colleagues many times 
throughout history. At first, everyone had assumed that Angelus and Darkness had totally 
benevolent motives in allowing the original bearer and some of the former Neogenes back to 
eliminate the ExCons, and even he still believed that was part of their plans. However, he 
wasn’t stupid enough to think that was the only reason.</p><p>Angelus and Darkness had been 
banished, limited in their powers and treated as pariahs. Like anyone in a position of great 
power suddenly cast down, he was sure they didn’t appreciate it. Also, the very fact that 
the mass majority of the Neogenes were in their domain, and the fact they obviously were 
trying to retain all of them (and there were a few hundred of them), it seemed to him that 
they had more on their mind than simply keeping them safe. Given their damaged pride, if all 
of those Neogenes had Witch Blades, and Angelus and Darkness really wanted to, they could 
have a formidable standing army at their beck and call.</p><p>He was sure this was part of 
their plans, and though it was uncertain if that was a good or bad thing, it was something 
to keep in mind. He didn’t think anything ill would be coming of this supposition, but he 
resolved not to forget, lest it come back to haunt them all later.</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>(back to the present)</p><p>Masane and Reiji actually looked slightly bleary 
eyed, and if either had gotten laid, it sure wasn’t obvious. They had walked in, and Marry 
let them know that an ExCon attacked last night.</p><p>“WHAT?!”</p><p>Aoi spoke up, “It was 
also trying to kill a fellow Sister.”</p><p>Masane held up a hand, “Okay, back up. Tell me 
again what happened last night.”</p><p>By this time, Cho walked into the room, and he and 
rest took turns filling in the gaps from last night, save Reina, who still looked horribly 
embarrassed. Masane and Reiji listened with rapt attention, especially at the parts where 
Reina apparently took a level in her already impressive badass, and the spiriting away of 
the Neogene. By the time they got to the part of Reina passing out, Masane chipped 
in,</p><p>“Same thing happened to me. The more power you draw from the blade, the more it 
draws from you.”</p><p>Reiji couldn’t resist commenting, “Does that means if you use too 
much power, it could kill you?</p><p>Masane grew really quiet as she replied,</p><p>“I 
actually tried that once.”</p><p>A quiet pall hung over the room, and everyone was loath to 
speak, until Asagi asked, “I’m assuming that after being drained of energy, it makes you 
really hungry, right?”</p><p>At that, Reiji looked over at Masane, remembering how she 
decided table manners were a really funny joke you tell your friends back on his boat, and 
quite obviously face palmed, and Masane shot him an annoyed look. Shiori then, wanting to 
save Reina further embarrassment, told them simply that Reina had been horribly famished 
this morning, and shot a death glare around the room, almost daring people to 
elaborate.</p><p>No one was that stupid, and Reina found she felt extremely grateful to 
Shiori for preserving her remaining dignity, and resolved to return the favor 
someday.</p><p>Some time later……………</p><p>Shiori had insisted she sleep off the rest of her 
weakness, and as a doctor, Reina really couldn’t argue the point, and thus bowed to logic 
and allowed Shiori to help her back up the stairs to their bedroom. She almost collapsed 
twice, but Shiori’s shoulder was providing a nice anchor against that, and as they entered 
their room, Reina felt like a paper doll as Shiori had to lay her out on the bed, and Reina 
felt more than a little impotent as Shiori even had to peel her outfit off her body like a 
snack wrapper.</p><p>Once she was lying like a motionless lump in her underwear, she watched 
as Shiori flitted around like a beetle, grabbing spare bedding and pillows. She allowed 
herself to be propped up and tucked by Shiori (though it wasn’t like she really could have 
resisted), and as Shiori was about to leave the room, she bent down, kissed Reina on the 
forehead once again, and said she’d be back to check on her, but she wanted her to just 
focus on getting some sleep.</p><p>Reina was too weak to say anything, but as Shiori closed 
the door, Reina wondered just what the hell she did to have so many people in her life show 
her love. Despite being busy almost all the time helping out Fa- Furumizu, the few times she 
interacted with her Sisters, they all treated her like a big sister, and Shiori was the one 
who adored her so much she literally fell in love with her. Reiji had fallen hard for her, 
bluntly confessing during the time Douji and the NSWF were on speaking terms that he frankly 
didn’t give a damn about whether their research went anywhere, he was just happy to have met 
her, and she remembered that his honesty had been so compelling it was intriguing to her, 
and she surrendered her body to him, wanting to see where this relationship 
went.</p><p>During this time, a horrifying realization became known to her, and she realized 
that up until this point, she had never given much thought to what her Sisters meant to the 
man they called Father, but as Reiji showed her passion and devotion, feelings she never 
knew she had bubbled up within her, and around the time she had her daughter (which she had 
taken great pains to keep secret as much as possible, for reasons she still did not 
completely understand), she found herself overcome with a deeply held disgust for what she 
was, and what her daughter might become if she let her become a tool of her Father. She 
intellectually knew why she and the other Sisters had been made, but having a child revealed 
to her feelings that overrode her reason, and the thought of her daughter joining the ranks 
of her Sisters and becoming another potential Clone Blade bearer or Neogene filled her with 
a disgust that bordered on the physical, and so seized with passion, she not only took her 
daughter, but the Witch Blade she had been studying with her. Taking the latter, according 
to what she remembered feeling at the time, was fueled out of disgust for the possibility 
her daughter might have to be a guinea pig for the damn thing. In fact, it was at that 
moment, she realized for the first time ever, she deeply resented 
“Father”.</p><p>Unfortunately, things didn’t end well. Both Douji and the NSWF hunted her 
ass down, both thinking the other backstabbed them and more or less killing their alliance. 
It only got worse when Angelus and Darkness were fed the hell up and blew up the damn town. 
Reina had been knocked unconscious, and when she awoke, she was back in the NSWF complex, 
without Rihoko or the Witch Blade, and to her shock, Furumizu never said anything to her, or 
even treated her differently aside from never bringing the subject up, even having her 
resume her old duties as before.</p><p>Reina had known, somehow, she now had a big black 
mark on her record with him, but the resentment that waxed within her since then all the way 
up until she rediscovered her daughter just kept growing, and soon after Shiori died as a 
result of one of the Clone Blades she had a hand in creating, her last thread of loyalty 
snapped. She took Rihoko back from Masane, broke off ties with Furumizu, and merely wanted 
to spend what little life she had left in peace (as she had also figured out the Clone Blade 
was slowly killing her). She knew all this in a calm, didactic way, but those feelings she 
had felt when she first spirited away her daughter made her feel regret she’d never get a 
chance to know that little girl Masane had raised even better than she wanted to 
admit.</p><p>And then, it all went to hell. Furumizu had merely been waiting for her to make 
her break official before he declared her life forfeit, and sicced Maria (a clone daughter 
made with her DNA and little else) on her, probably knowing she’d snap upon seeing Rihoko, 
which she did, which merely confirmed to Reina that not only did he want her dead, but 
Rihoko as well, if for no other reason than to make her pay for betrayal.</p><p>Certain 
death at hand, those maternal feelings seized control of her, and she decided to fight Maria 
in exchange for Rihoko’s safety, figuring it would be one of the few noble things she did 
with her life (even if it meant she’d have to kill one daughter to save another). She had 
played God, served an amoral bastard (and abetting his twisted desires), and abandoning the 
one man who tried to love her, but she decided to go down fighting, realizing why Masane had 
mourned the loss of Rihoko, and feeling ever the more she should sacrifice 
herself.</p><p>Sure enough, she fought Maria, and lost, but Rihoko survived, and as she lay 
dying, she realized that, for once, she had done the right thing, and when Reiji had found 
her, she had, with her dying breath, begged his forgiveness for her betrayal, and told him 
to give her daughter to a better mother than herself.</p><p>And then she died.</p><p>When 
she had been revived, the first thing she saw was the woman she wronged by taking away the 
child who gave her happiness, but Masane held no malice for her, even offering to reconnect 
her with her daughter. As Reina accepted her chance at redemption, Shiori and Maria were 
restored to life, and as the woman who tried to love her and the daughter who had never 
properly known her love were once again made known to her, it was at that moment she 
realized she had a chance to right what had once gone so wrong.</p><p>And, as her eyes 
closed, a small smile crossed her face as she realized she now free of her demons, 
surrounded by those who showed her love and whom she could love in return.</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>(Three days later)</p><p>The JSDF had fully moved into its new offices, and had 
discovered that it would simply be more cost effective to retool the manufacturing 
facilities to produce JSDF approved war munitions than actually transporting their own 
equipment and replacing the Douji tech. Also, it seemed several Douji executives had 
actually had the foresight to see what would happen if the crap hit the fan, and thus most 
of the paperwork regarding I Weapon/ExCon/Clone Blade research, development, or production 
had been introduced to the shredder, and most of the remaining stocks of inventory were 
either empty, or simply empty shells, and to the credit of the guys burying the evidence, 
the biological components of most of the I Weapons were simply gone, though examination of 
the residue in the blast furnaces and incinerators revealed where most of it wound up. That 
aside, it had also been discovered that a huge portion of Douji’s employees were extremely 
ignorant of what their employers weapons production plants made, and most of the guys who 
were involved had either gone underground or did a heel face turn and were given clemency in 
exchange for helping the JSDF develop ways to destroy their former creations.</p><p>As for 
the anti-ExCon mission, they had just finished converting a former I Weapon R&D lab into the 
new HQ of the task force. All that was left was for the last members of the team to join up 
so they could assume operational status.</p><p>That said, Colonel Toijira was currently in 
what would soon be Reiji Takayama’s office, mildly annoyed that his ass had barely warmed 
the new office seat before he had to get up to plug the phone back in, as the twit who set 
the place up apparently forgot that. Once that task was over, he dialed up Reiji Takayama’s 
cell phone,</p><p>“Reiji Takayama speaking.”</p><p>“It’s me. I’m having a meeting later 
today I wanted you to attend. My team is ready, and I was wondering if you made your 
decision.” he replied, quite sure of his answer.</p><p>Five seconds later, he had to 
restrain an urge to gloat at how right he was.</p><p>“Excellent, Takayama-san. I assume 
Amaha-san and her associates will be attending?”</p><p>“Yes. I was wondering if you have any 
objections to my inviting some additional guests?”</p><p>“And these are?”</p><p>He told 
him.</p><p>“I see. Are they aware of the interests I’m representing?”</p><p>He replied in 
affirmative.</p><p>“Very well, bring them with you. Anything else?”</p><p>He replied in the 
negative.</p><p>“Good. Please bring yourself and your associates to the front of the 
building by 2:00 PM. There will be someone to guide you to the conference room we’ll be 
in.”</p><p>With that, he hung up.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(1:30 P.M.)</p><p>Reiji looked at 
the motley crew that had asked to attend the meeting. He and the Witch Blades were obviously 
going to go, but the fact Cho and Yuusuke wanted to go hadn’t been in the original plans. At 
least Yuusuke made sense, seeing as he wanted to go see if the JSDF/Thirteen was as full of 
crap as Douji’s former management had been. It still seemed odd Cho wanted to show up too, 
though considering the man was good with computers, he really needed more income than as a 
part time computer jockey, and his porno was getting too expensive to support, he was 
apparently hoping to earn some serious cash in exchange for the continued privilege of 
seeing digitally enhanced tits.</p><p>Deciding it probably wouldn’t be a bad idea to invite 
them, he looked around at the people currently gathered outside Marry’s to make sure they 
were ready.</p><p>He was wearing a standard business suit, as was Masane. It weirded him out 
slightly to see Reina and Maria side by side, as they now looked like clones in their chosen 
attire, except Maria was shorter than her mother, and he really had to fight back an urge to 
refer to Maria as “Mini Me”. Aoi and Shiori had apparently opted for the slightly less fancy 
high grade secretary look, which he found oddly appropriate, and Asagi looked REALLY odd in 
a business suit, though he was grateful she had ditched the black lipstick. Yuusuke looked 
like a certain red haired Turk off “Advent Children” in his suit, which given that Yuusuke 
kept scowling as if he were miserable, made Takayama believe the he was not the suit and tie 
kind of guy, which was his bad luck if he actually got a job today. Cho actually took a 
business suit like a duck to water, looking totally at ease, but the lime green tie he wore 
clashed badly with his bleach white button shirt, and his cologne was apparently so powerful 
it knocked Aoi out (and everyone noticed Maria really looked disappointed she wouldn’t have 
to initiate mouth to mouth).</p><p>However, due to the sheer numbers, Tozawa took half in 
his car, and he took the other half in his car.</p><p>That settled it was time to set 
out.</p><p>(Twenty minutes later)</p><p>As they pulled in front of the former Douji 
Industries, Reiji couldn’t resist a feeling of déjà vu laced with heavy irony. A line from 
an American TV show just wouldn’t stop reverberating through his brain as he 
parked,</p><p><i>“As much as I try to escape, they keep pulling me back 
in…………”</i></p><p>His reverie was abruptly ended as he Masane, Aoi, Maria, and Asagi stepped 
out of his car, and Tozawa, Cho, Shiori,</p><p>and Reina stepped out of Yuusuke’s. As they 
did, he realized the Colonel hadn’t been kidding about being met at the door, for no sooner 
had he parked, no other than Hiroki Segawa was there to meet him.</p><p>“Pleased to see you, 
sir.” said Hiroki, affable as ever, “And glad to see you are well, Ms. 
Amaha.”</p><p>“Thanks, Segawa.” replied Takayama politely yet curtly, “I take it you’ll be 
our escort.”</p><p>“Yes sir. Colonel Toijira had told me I’m to be working under yourself 
again, and told me to personally show you around, as a lot has changed since you were last 
here.” With that, he ushered them forward through the front doors.</p><p>As Segawa led them 
forward through the still somewhat familiar hallways, Reiji had to concede in parts, the 
place was almost recognizable. The Douji logo had been removed, replaced by the JSDF emblem. 
The walls seemed to have some plants and a metric ton of motivational posters, mostly 
extolling the virtue of hard work and efficiency, were hung in every available space. He 
also saw far less suits and far more uniforms, which told him right then and there that the 
military obviously was one of those employers who thought the little guy was literally the 
back bone of the company, whereas the REMF’s were support people.</p><p>Douji had had an 
entirely different idea, of course.</p><p>The rest of the entourage followed behind in 
silence, and though Reiji wasn’t going to admit it, he felt nervous despite having been 
through this very building only God really knew how many times. As Hiroki stopped in front 
of one of the larger conference rooms, he picked a clipboard from a table beside the door. 
Pulling a gold nibbed pen out his pocket, he handed it to his former boss with an apologetic 
look,</p><p>“Colonel Toijira asked me to get everyone’s names, so he can duly report to his 
superiors who attended this meeting, sir.”</p><p>No more words need be said as he signed, 
and the clipboard was passed around. Once they all signed, he handed it back, and Segawa 
asked them to wait a moment. He walked inside, and after a few moments, he opened to the 
door and ushered them inside. He and the others saw a huge conference table had been set up, 
and several commissioned JDSF officers were already seated. Toijira saw him and gestured to 
the entire left side of the table, whose seats were free. He and the others wordlessly sat 
down. As they did, Toijira thanked them for coming, and proceeded to introduce everyone, 
starting with the right side of the table, more or less introducing the military side of the 
of the company.</p><p>Once that was finished, Toijira switched over to introducing the main 
attraction: Reiji and his kickass d00dz.</p><p>“This is former Douji board director Reiji 
Takayama. He has decided to join our company on our anti-ExCon strike team, and despite 
having no military training, led some of his former employees, who now work under myself, 
into a pitched battle with those I Weapons his associates made, and acquitted himself rather 
well.”</p><p>A moment of respectful light applause started up from the other side of the 
table, joined by Toijira, and he bowed slightly, feeling a little put on the spot. He then 
gestured to Masane, and the unmistakable tone of respect in his voice was obvious as he 
said, “Not that this woman needs introduction, but she is Masane Amaha. She bears the Witch 
Blade, and used it to take down an entire army and save a city.”</p><p>The applause was 
rather thick this time, and Masane found herself blushing as even her side of the table 
chipped in. Just as she thought the redness on her face would leave a scar, the Colonel held 
up his hand for silence and gestured to Reina and the former Neogenes.</p><p>“Our first 
guest is Dr. Reina Sohou, head researcher for the now late Tatsuoki Furumizu of the now 
defunct NSWF. She defected from the organization because she grew a conscience, and 
apparently risked her life to defend an innocent little girl from harm, and the others,” 
pointing as she said the names, “are Shiori Tsuzuki, Maria Sohou, Aoi Nagisa, and Asagi 
Watanabe, former Neogenes who also defected and now wish to help put down the remaining 
ExCons still skulking around this city.”</p><p>He paused for a moment, looking over Yuusuke 
and Cho, and then he announced their names and asked why they were there.</p><p>“Well, to be 
blunt, I was helping Masane uncover Douji’s dirty laundry, and wanted to see how messy the 
JSDF’s clothes hamper was.” replied Yuusuke, politely but firmly.</p><p>To the surprise of 
everyone in the room, he actually regarded him with a warm smile as she said, “You were the 
one who helped the Tokyo News Network do their expose, correct?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Well, 
I’d first like to thank you, and after this meeting is over, I’d like to talk to you about a 
possible position here.”</p><p>He nodded, and the Colonel turned his attention to Cho, “And 
you, sir?”</p><p>“We’ll, sir, I helped Mr. Tozawa hack into the NSWF database, and 
discovered the purpose behind the Neogenes, and I’d like to offer my technical skills to 
your organization.”</p><p>Everyone else on the right of the table looked over at the older 
man, and Toijira said in perfectly level voice,</p><p>“I assume you believe what we are 
doing involves the former Neogenes?” He knew full well it did, and wanted to see if this old 
guy was just an attention groupie, or he really know what he was talking about.</p><p>Cho, 
to everyone’s surprise, got dead serious as he told the Colonel, “With all due respect, 
Colonel, but assuming your anti-ExCon force wants to be effective, you probably know their 
preferred targets are women, and during the events preceding your arrival, a high majority 
of those women happened to be Neogenes. Since there are still several dozen Neogenes left 
floating around, I’d assume you’d really like to know their locations, so they can be 
protected from harm or if you really wish to be cold about it, use them as bait.”</p><p>He 
paused for a moment, letting this sink in, and then continued, “I’m also assuming you’re 
aware that I’ve already decoded many of the NSWF’s encryption protocols, and assuming the 
records from the NSWF will be subsumed into your operations, I’d like to lend my expertise 
to helping you save these women and decode that info.”</p><p>The temperature of the room 
sank about fifteen degree as the Colonel and every other suit in the room regarded him 
coldly, and then the warmth returned as she sighed and said, “You’re absolutely correct. The 
police are planning a joint raid on the NSWF premises in conjunction with the JDSF and per 
their prior arrangements, with the Witch Blade bearers. Since I am the commanding officer, 
my personnel will also be there, and having someone on hand to decode their computer 
algorithms would be useful, so I would be willing to accept your services on retainer for 
that time.”</p><p>That said, she changed gears and said, “I did get ahead of myself, so let 
me backtrack. Today, we are forming the anti-ExCon side of what we are calling “Dreizhen 
Industries”. It will be composed of JDSF personnel, pardoned Douji employees, and”, 
gesturing towards the Witch Blades, “deputized civilians from the Tokyo Police”.</p><p>He 
paused as Segawa, who had ducked out of the room, returned with some forms which he quietly 
placed in front of each person at the table save Toijira, Cho, and Yuusuke. After doing 
this, he promptly left again, locking the door as he left, leaving the Colonel to 
continue.</p><p>“Everyone here is considered subject to military censorship regarding out 
activities and no information is to be given to non cleared individuals except at the JSDF’s 
discretion. Our mission is to safeguard civilians from being attacked by the ExCons and 
rescue the remaining Neogenes, if possible. Disclosure to the wrong parties could get people 
hurt or killed, and I will not tolerate or accept any unauthorized leaking. Is that 
clear?”</p><p>Yuusuke kept his mouth shut, despite an immense urge to open it, and the rest 
merely nodded.</p><p>“That said, those forms in front of you are employment forms licensing 
you as employees of Dreizhen Industries, which is for all intents and purposes a subsidiary 
of the Japanese Self Defense Forces. Also, as allies of the Thirteen, which the new people 
will be joining today or merely affirming their preexisting commitments to for the current 
members, I don’t think I have to remind anyone we are a secret organization, and by signing 
these forms, you have officially crossed the precipice, and there is no turning back.”, and 
she looked at Yuusuke and Cho and said, “and you two were not originally on our list of 
considered members, so I will getting your employment forms for you later, but I fully 
expect you will not be breathing a word about our organization to anyone.”</p><p>Allowing 
just a hint of menace to creep into his tone, she added,</p><p>“Is that clear?”</p><p>They 
nodded.</p><p>His old manner returned. “Now that that’s settled, please fill out those forms 
while I go attend to some business. I’ll be back briefly, so just wait here.” That said, he 
headed for the door, unlocked it, and stepped outside, relocking it as she turned to Segawa, 
who was waiting outside.</p><p>“I’ll need two more employment forms, and I want you to 
escort our little entourage to the staging area when we’re done.”</p><p>“Yes, sir”, and 
abruptly took his leave.</p><p>As he did, the Colonel allowed his stern manner to relax as 
he thought,</p><p><i>“Well, the team is shaping up. Here’s hoping they’re enough to prevent 
more innocents from getting hurt.</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>As the Colonel waited outside 
the door, everyone else filled out the forms, and possibly due to the gravity of the 
situation, no one felt the urge to speak. Finally, after a long while, they all finished, 
and they set down their pens, and though no prohibition had been made on speaking, no one 
spoke, settling for remaining quiet and mostly avoiding direct eye 
contact.</p><p>Thankfully, this didn’t last long, as the Colonel popped back in, holding two 
more sets of employment forms, and informed them, “Segawa will be escorting you to a nearby 
auditorium, so while I’m handling these two gentleman’s employment, the rest of you can 
follow him there."</p><p>Their orders given, the troops filed out and followed Segawa, and 
once they were gone, Toijira resumed his seat at the head of the table, pointed to the 
chairs on either side of his own, and motioned for them to sit down. They did, and they both 
got the weird impression of being interrogated as he started asking yes or no 
questions.</p><p>“Are you aware of what this company does publicly?</p><p>They answered 
yes.</p><p>“Are you aware of the organization I am a part of, and do you realize the 
interests I represent?</p><p>Again, they said yes.</p><p>“Do either of you have a problem 
with any of this knowledge. If so, let me know now.”</p><p>Cho said no, but Yuusuke, hearing 
no threats attached and being a man married to truth, said yes. Toijira barely looked fazed 
as he asked,</p><p>“Does it bother you that Japanese military is taking orders from a third 
party who desires to remain anonymous?”</p><p>“No, but why do their actions have to be 
secret?” He actually knew the obvious reasons; he just wanted to get a measure of Toijira’s 
morals.</p><p>“Good question. Do you really think the public would have responded positively 
to Masane coming out as the Witch Blade bearer, before she saved this town’s collective 
ass?”</p><p>Yuusuke stayed silent, wanting to hear more.</p><p>“The reason the Thirteen are 
a secret organization is because there always aliens, mages, eldritch abominations, and 
breakdowns in the space/time continuum that we constantly deal with, and the only way most 
of the public gets to live their happy lives is if they do not know about it.”</p><p>“Point 
taken, but why aren’t you guys antsy over the Witch Blade’s existence being outed 
already?”</p><p>“Simple. We can’t exactly put the genie back in the bottle, so we’re trying 
to deal with the aftereffects as decisively as possible to prevent the loss of more lives 
and panic.”</p><p>“I guess my question is answered.” said Tozawa.</p><p>“I’m glad you showed 
up today because I was looking to hire you as the Press Liaison for this company. We’ll be 
working closely with the Tokyo Police Department, and I’d like you to personally update them 
on what we do just so they know we aren’t doing a rehash of Douji’s cloak and dagger antics. 
You’ll be working with Chief Akira Nakata, whom I understand you have some background with.” 
saying this last bit with a bit of a playful smirk.</p><p>Ruefully, he confirmed, “Yeah, he 
hates my guts.”</p><p>“This is why you’re perfect for the role I have lined up. He hates the 
air you breathe, but considering you and he have worked for the same goals, he also has 
great reason to trust you, making you perfect for the role. You’ll be updating him and the 
news networks of our activities, and as long as the existence of the Thirteen never makes it 
into your releases I leave everything else, barring some matters covered under military 
censorship, to your discretion.”</p><p>Having heard that, Yuusuke Tozawa was almost sold. 
However, honesty compelled him to respond, “If I do join up, the first time I see you guys 
do anything like what Douji and the NSWF did, I’ll blow your cover and screw the 
consequences.”, finishing with a reflexive tightening of the shoulders to show his 
resolve.</p><p>Toijira actually looked impressed, “That’s what I expected you’d say, and I 
wouldn’t blame you if it ever did happen”, saying this in a tone indicating there wasn’t a 
snowball’s chance in hell it would, “and with that said, still want the job?”</p><p>In 
response, Yuusuke told him, “I’m filling out this form, but I’d also like to shake hands 
when were done.”</p><p>The Colonel knew exactly the amount of trust Yuusuke was putting in 
him, and replied, “I’ll do my best not to dishonor your trust in me, Tozawa-san.”</p><p>That 
said, he turned to the paperwork, and Toijira turned to Cho, whom he told,</p><p>“After I 
last talked to Takayama-san, I got some private investigators to look into the background of 
his associates and close friends, and it turns out that the perverted old man façade you 
currently wear hides the fact that you used to make a killing for several major 
corporations.”</p><p>“I did.” Cho said, emphasis deliberately placed on the second word, as 
the last corporation had tied up most of the money he had made in their retirement plan, 
which some greedy bean counter had been grafting from, though to be fair, he was screwing 
over half the company, and bolted with over 95% of everybody’s money just as he was about to 
get caught. Soon after, disillusioned and pissed off, he earned more modest wages as a part 
time computer techie and had moved into Marry’s. And the rest was history.</p><p>“That said, 
not only am I interested in hiring you as a consultant to help us collate all that data we 
have on the ExCons and Neogenes, you have my word you will not be cheated from as long as 
you work for my company. Any asshole who so much as tries will have his body parts ripped 
off and sold on EBay piece by piece to pay you back, that is, if they even get a chance. 
Much like Tozawa, you have my personal word on that.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir.”</p><p>What he 
did next nearly made Tozawa gag on his next breath and totally surprised Cho.</p><p>“Just 
curious, is my near constant stone attitude and take no bullshit demeanor making me look 
like a total asshole?”</p><p>His face looked casual at this, but Cho wasn’t stupid. Any 
potential boss who asked such a loaded personal question was trying to determine if their 
potential employee was a kiss ass.</p><p>Deciding to be wise, he replied, “It might make you 
seem unpleasant to some, but it mostly means that you take your job as the boss as seriously 
as you should.” and he then asked, “Could I add one more thing, off the record?”</p><p>“Of 
course.”</p><p>“If you were a woman, it would probably make you attractive.”</p><p>Tozawa 
nearly choked on his own breath as Toijira’s eyes widened in surprise. Either Cho 
appreciated strong, sophisticated women who took charge, or he was a masochist who enjoyed 
being pushed around by women.</p><p>If the latter was true, his interactions with Marry just 
took on a whole new meaning.</p><p>Toijira recovered his composure after a second and said, 
“I appreciate the compliment Cho-san. You’re hired, albeit in a consultant 
capacity.”</p><p>That sounded just fine to Cho. After all, being a consultant basically 
meant he sat on his ass unless needed, was paid regardless, and could work from home. That 
said he immediately started on his paperwork. As he worked on it, Toijira informed 
him,</p><p>“You two just became allied to the Thirteen and JSDF employees, and the same 
condition of secrecy applies.”</p><p>They nodded in acknowledgement, and Cho hurried through 
the rest of his paperwork.</p><p>Once they were both done, Toijira looked at his new 
consultant and PR guy, smiled, shook hands, and escorted them to the auditorium.</p><hr 
size=1 noshade><p>In the meantime, most of the suits and the Witch Blade nakama said hello 
to each other, and more than one wanted to shake hands with them, thanking them for their 
service, which was, frankly, kinda overpowering, but it was nice to know that their good 
works had been recognized.</p><p>Before the introductions could continue, Toijira, Yuusuke, 
and Cho walked in and Toijira told them to take seats near the front. As they all did, the 
Colonel walked up to a podium just in front of them, his back to a massive jury rigged 
projector screen. Picking up a remote, he aimed it at the projection machine in the corner, 
while Segawa walked in and dimmed the lights. Some other Dreizhen personnel walked in and 
took seats behind them, and once what seemed like several dozen people sat down, Toijira 
started his presentation, flipping the first picture to an aerial map of the Dreizhen 
Industries complex.</p><p>“This meeting is more or less an orientation session for all 
employees involved in the anti-ExCon mission or will be assisting as support personnel. That 
said, I will be going over some matters regarding that arrangement that should be considered 
classified.”</p><p>“Questions?”</p><p>No one raised their hands in the almost darkness, so 
he continued,</p><p>“Our mission is twofold. First, we will be cleaning up Douji’s mess and 
killing the ExCons. Second, we will cooperate the municipal police forces to come up with 
countermeasures for any attack made by the ExCons or anything similar. Also, in accordance 
with Japanese military law, this corporation and its employees will be considered under 
military jurisdiction, and any illegal action that threatens out joint mission will be dealt 
with according to military law.”</p><p>“I will be responsible for the military side of this 
operation. I should also mention that we will have military personnel quartered here as a 
garrison force to oversee this operation and handle any materials deemed not suitable for 
civilians to handle. And, since all of you volunteered for this operation, I hope you read 
the fine print, because unless you are injured, dead, or we see fit to release you, you are 
all bound to your duties like any other soldier. Is that clear?”</p><p>A call of assent 
resounded, and the picture changed again to a roster sheet of the task force’s ranking 
officers:</p><p><b>JDSF OVERSEER- COLONEL DAISUKE TOIJIRA</b></p><p><b>CIVILIAN OVERSEER- 
REIJI TAKAYAMA (SIMULATED )</b></p><p><b>BATTLE COMMANDER: MASANE AMAHA (SIMULATED 
MAJOR)</b></p><p><b>BATTLE COMMANDER XO/ALTERNATE- REINA SOHOU (SIMULATED 
CAPTAIN)</b></p><p><b>(In Lieu of a Medical Officer, Dr. Sohou shall also assume this 
role)</b></p><p><b>WITCH BLADE SPECIAL FORCES: SHIORI TSUZUKI (SIMULATED 1</b><b>ST</b><b> 
LIEUTENANT)</b></p><p><b>WITCH BLADE SPECIAL FORCES: MARIA SOHOU (SIMULATED 
SERGEANT)</b></p><p><b>WITCH BLADE SPECIAL FORCES: AOI NAGISA (SIMULATED 
SERGEANT)</b></p><p><b>WITCH BLADE SPECIAL FORCES: ASAGI WATANABE (SIMULATED 
SERGEANT)</b></p><p><b>INTERDEPARTMENTAL LIASION: HIROKI SEGAWA (SIMULATED WARRANT 
OFFICER)</b></p><p>As the list was read by everyone, Toijira told Segawa to flip the lights 
back on, and told Yuusuke and Cho to stand on either side of the podium. He introduced their 
names and positions, and then told everyone their first day of work would begin tomorrow. He 
also went on to say that they would be cooperating with the police and military to commence 
a raid of the NSWF premises, and as he said this, his eyes drifted over to Masane and 
Takayama, as if to say,</p><p><i>“I’m sure that will be of particular interest to 
you.”</i></p><p>After that, the meeting was adjourned and the ranking officers were told 
they would be expected to go on the investigation, but everyone else was on standby just in 
case. That said, he told most of the rank and file people to leave, as he had things he 
needed to discuss with the senior brass, and they were to return to whatever they had been 
doing prior to this meeting.</p><p>Once they all filed out, he had some directives for each 
party. For Cho, he wanted him to get all of his information ready to be integrated into what 
they gleaned from the NSWF. For Yuusuke, he wanted him to tip off the media as to the 
legality and purpose of their upcoming raid, and to also inform the media that due to 
military involvement, they would not get to attend or even get anywhere near the premises, 
and that Yuusuke himself would be giving an official press release at a suitable time. Reiji 
and Masane were told that Toijira wanted the information he had given them (without 
specifying, but they knew what he meant) back in his hands. Segawa was told that he was 
attending, and that he was to defer all inquiries as to his activities until he returned, 
and that he was effectively acting CEO in Reiji/his place until he returned.</p><p>He then 
changed gears and said they’d all be getting a good look on their new headquarters building 
after the raid went down, and briefly explained that due to the heavy military presence, the 
guys in suits were giving them simulated ranks to make the military processing and equipment 
procurement procedures easier. He finished by saying that if anyone besides Reina or Masane 
wanted to bow out of going back to the NSWF premises, they were free not to attend.</p><p>To 
his surprise, none of the other former Neogenes opted out.</p><p>That dealt with, he told 
them they were free to leave, and he’d be calling them the following day with further 
instructions. He also informed them that due to the fact all the team members were now 
considered senior employees as well as military assets; they would be getting company 
provided transportation by military personnel, though he drily remarked that if anything 
untoward happened, they’d probably kick even more ass than their uniformed 
wards.</p><p>After waiting for the light laughter to pass, he had Segawa escort them out. 
Once they were all gone, he headed back to his office, where he called his boss.</p><p>“We 
have them all on board now, sir.”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(Later that night, 
Marry’s)</p><p>Cho was busily working in his hacker cave, backing up all of his data, Reiji 
already had gotten the Thirteen info and the Witch Blade research ready, Yuusuke had already 
tipped off Kyoko, who had passed the word for him, who had also congratulated him on his new 
job, not to mentioned teased him about his hatred of suits, which he now would be unable to 
avoid, prompting Yuusuke to get resigned as he asked her to not remind him, a futile effort 
to put it charitably. She had also asked him how free he was to talk about anything he might 
learn (he was now working on behalf of the government, after all), and he said, he wasn’t 
sure yet, but he’d tell her whatever he could.</p><p>Reiji and Masane were in her room, less 
concerned about the raid on the NSWF complex (despite Masane’s brief incarceration there), 
and more about the immediate ramifications of what this would do to their lives, and Rihoko. 
Reiji was the first one to point out that now they had some clout, they might as well 
exercise it and ask the Colonel and his putative superiors to put some protection on their 
daughter as well, as any asshole with half a skull would consider her a primary hostage. 
Masane noted without irony that had the NSWF and the more corrupt of Takayama’s former 
associates not been confusedly drooling so much, they might have pulled that stunt too, and 
said she’d insist on it. She pointed out to him that it might be good to get her some 
homeschooling to compliment her already vast common sense, as Masane regretted not having 
the means to do so earlier, and besides, Reina had asked about that, and Masane had to admit 
to her she had been very poor in that regard, and this guilt was a heavier burden than she 
ever wanted to keep bearing. They went to sleep soon after, though with weighted 
hearts.</p><p>As for the other Neogenes, the reactions were somewhere between “we have to 
face our past” and “I know, but the memories are too horrible, but I’m going anyway”. Maria 
and Aoi, much saner and aware of what they had been a part of now, were a combination of 
both, and Maria confessed to Aoi she wasn’t sure if she could stomach what she might see, 
knowing that the NSWF usually handled its own injured or dead without going through official 
medical or mortuary channels, and they might run across records, or even bodies those she 
had either hurt severely, even killed during her psychotic days. Aoi didn’t know what to 
say, mostly because she was scared of seeing the same horrific tableau, but she merely 
decided to give Maria silent moral support, and hugged her close, telling her that despite 
her past, she’d always be loved by her, and besides, her own past wasn’t pretty either, so 
she would not hate Maria for the part she had played in the twisted puppet show of Puppet 
Master Furumizu, and Maria told her the same, and the night ended with Maria and Aoi curled 
up in each other’s arms, scared at what they might see, and secure that they’d be together 
to face it.</p><p>Reina and Shiori were somewhat different, to say the least. Reina’s hands 
were actually stained with possibly even more blood than her daughter. After all, her battle 
codename of “Lady” (of War) wasn’t just a colorful description. Back in her formative years, 
she too had been an emotionless doll who injured or killed if it would’ve pleased “Father”, 
and though he had never used her sexually, she hadn’t been totally unaware he had done the 
same to others, and on top of Maria’s concerns, she was also fearing finding records of 
sexual abuse she could have stopped, and it sickened her to know she had once been as amoral 
as the bastard whose DNA she still carried, and she had just let herself be his willing 
pawn. Shiori was upset with herself, but for more parochial but no less commendable 
reasons.</p><p>She had been a slightly less malevolent version of Maria, but what still 
filled her with guilt was that one kill she had made when she totally snapped, murdering the 
Neogene who had come in to attend to her, and she killed her without even a reason or even 
an excuse. That murder was still etched on her conscience, and the fact she had once been 
little better than “Father” in terms of human decency made her feel not much better than the 
woman she had feelings for, and both finally fell asleep in each other’s arms, minds 
occupied and consciences burdened.</p><p>As for Asagi, Marry had learned some interesting 
things. She was a late Generation Three Neogene (when to Furumizu’s ignorance his Neogene 
chief geneticist Rie Nishida had been splicing other DNA into the mix), so she was unaware 
of the exact depths of her ties to “Father”, but she too felt a little trepidation at seeing 
what she had once been an apathetic part of, and even confessed seeing what she would be 
seeing was actually making her very nervous, but she was facing her past, so she could 
finally bury it and get on with being a human being.</p><p>Marry found herself very inspired 
by her young roommate’s urge to enjoy life despite her unnatural entrance to it, and as she 
herself went to sleep, she hoped Asagi was not only able to face and overcome her past, she 
hoped her and the other girls could enjoy life.</p><p>As did, for the most part, everyone 
else.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Aisheritu- An extremely formal and romantic way of saying “I
