<h1>Priori Addendum (part 1 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../witchblade/index.html">Witchblade</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rpgingmaster.html">RPGing Master</a><br> </h2>
<p>Despite the fact her death was certain, the bearer of the Power of Balance knew her 
victory was complete. The I-Weapons that had been crowding Tokyo Tower en masse had ceased 
their aggression, as well as their mortal existence. In fact, as she felt herself being 
swallowed in the conflagration of light she herself had summoned to free them, Masane Amaha 
found herself smiling. She had saved Tokyo from the anguish of thousands of souls who 
desired to be free. She had stopped the senseless bloodshed over a bauble whose history was 
stained with far too much blood anyway. And most of all, as she felt the light of destiny 
envelop her, she was at total peace with herself, and could die knowing her daughter would 
be in a better world……………</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, standing on the shore opposite 
Tokyo Tower, Reiji Takayama felt his heart, an organ he had once thought long dead, would 
burst. The woman who had initially annoyed him, pissed him off, treated him like crap, and 
drove him crazy was also the same woman he had been willing to shed blood for, the woman who 
helped him resolve his feelings for his now dead lover, the woman who had helped him 
reconnect with his daughter was the same woman who had just been forced to sacrifice her 
life for the foolish sins of others.</p><p>Yes, Masane Amaha was all the above, but she also 
didn’t deserve this. She lost her memory, nearly lost the right to parent a child who needed 
a mother, nearly lost her freedom to a nutcase and now gibbering lunatic of a former rival, 
and now she had been forced to give up her life as atonement for the mistakes of 
others.</p><p>It wasn’t fair.</p><p>As Reiji Takayama watched the light that swallowed his 
lover and mother to his child. Rihoko Amaha saw something quite different. In fact, as the 
light faded, she saw all the monsters that her mother had fought to keep from hurting people 
gone, and in its place was a glittery afterglow, which left a shower of sparkles that bathed 
the formerly battered city in a crescendo of beautiful lights.</p><p>Most of all, when even 
that faded, she saw the promise of her mother vowing to be with her always, and refused to 
forsake it.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>A bright light shone upon the dreariness of the 
dimension known as the Other Realm, a misty world of both twilight and shadows, causing the 
very foundations of its walls to shake. As this happened, its masters, or more properly its 
prisoners, felt cracks form in their divine bonds, and as the light faded, they saw its 
source in the distance, and decided to wait for the one who had broken the cell bars to 
approach.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>“So, I guess I’m dead now.”</p><p>These words had just 
exited the mouth of Masane Amaha, who was not only dumbfounded she had scarcely felt her own 
demise, but found she felt rather unperturbed about it. Well, aside from the fact that she 
was still trying to blink away what seemed the world’s largest camera flash. It went away 
soon enough, and as the light faded, she immediately regretted its passing.</p><p>As far as 
the eye could see, there was an ever present mist, a kind of rolling fog that seemed to hang 
over everything like someone had left out several tubs of dry ice, except the fog didn’t 
seem to be made of water, nor had any temperature at all. Aside from the fog, all she could 
see was a desolate grayish wasteland that seemed to go on forever. There was no sun or moon, 
just freakish spots of light highlighting grayish ground with long intervals of gloomy, 
foggy darkness. The ground felt like she were standing on mildly warm bathroom tile, and had 
an almost unnaturally smooth texture to it.</p><p>She took a step forward, realizing as she 
did that not only did she seem to have her own human body, but said body was completely 
naked. Feeling self conscious, she tried to cover herself, and realized the only garment she 
wore was the Witchblade, which looked perfectly unblemished, which struck her as highly odd, 
given how it breaking down was what had apparently killed her-</p><p><i>“Actually, Masane, 
the curse on me killed you.”</i></p><p>At that, Masane whirled around; looking for the low, 
calm voice that sounded like it was being whispered in her ear. Just as she was to wonder if 
dying had made her delusional, the voice spoke again.</p><p><i>“Masane, you aren’t 
delusional. The voice you are hearing is in your mind.”</i></p><p>“Who are you?” Masane 
asked, feeling like an idiot for talking to herself.</p><p>“<i>The Witch Blade, child of 
Angelus and Darkness, holder of the Power of Balance. And you are my latest </i><i>Bearer, 
Masane, though oddly, I have yet to separate from you to find a new one.”</i></p><p><i>“What 
do you mean?”</i> Masane thought back, deciding since she was dead, the old rules of sanity 
didn’t apply anymore.</p><p><i>“It means that upon the death of my bearer, I separate from 
them until I become one with a new bearer.”</i></p><p><i>“But I’m dead, 
right?”</i></p><p><i>“That’s what I thought. Yet, I am still bound to you, which is supposed 
to mean otherwise.”</i></p><p>At that, Masane was totally confused. She was dead, butt 
naked, talking with a voice in her head that claimed to be the magic bracelet she had worn 
in life, which was now telling her that she probably wasn’t dead.</p><p>As she decided not 
hurt her already sore mind by trying to make rational sense of all this, she felt a shiver 
pass through her as she once more became conscious of her nudity.</p><p><i>“Would you like 
some clothes. I have to admit to enjoying the view, but I’m sure you’d appreciate some 
clothes, right?”</i></p><p><i>“Um, sure…………and would you mind applying a little more of 
yourself around my ass and boobs? I kinda got used to it, but it’d be nice if you’d make me 
look a little less like a stripper.”</i></p><p><i>“You aren’t the first bearer to say that. 
Here goes.”</i></p><p>At those words, Masane felt the flowing feeling of the Witch Blade’s 
substance slide over her ass and cleavage (making her resemble her Level 2 form in her 
standard black armor). Feeling more than a little aroused at the intimacy of the contact, 
she asked a question she had just started to consider.</p><p><i>“Are you enjoying 
this?”</i></p><p><i>“Guilty. I’m male.”</i></p><p><i>“Let me get this straight. Every time 
you transformed me, you were essentially groping me?”</i></p><p><i>“Hey, it’s kinda 
incidental, so I can’t help it.”</i></p><p><i>“Well, at least you didn’t rip my clothes when 
you did that.”</i></p><p><i>“I used to until Sarah, one of my former bearers, got pissed off 
she had keep buying new outfits and chewed me out for it. I haven’t done it since.</i><i> 
But mostly I stopped because I had to make a little sister of myself at one point for a 
little girl named Hope. I figured I would be the wise older brother in her eyes and show my 
bearers a lot more respect in that regard, and you have my word on 
that.”</i></p><p><i>“Well, you might be a pervert, but at least you’re a nice 
one.”</i></p><p><i>“I try.”</i></p><p>At that point, Masane realized she had bigger 
concerns, and decided to resume asking more important questions.</p><p><i>“You said the 
curse on you killed me. What curse?”</i></p><p>Before the Witch Blade could respond, a voice 
called out from a bright light that shone in the distance amidst the darkness. It was a 
woman’s voice, which sounded both loving and stern, and could be heard saying, “Approach, 
child. We await you and your bearer.”</p><p>Masane, not knowing what it was, nonetheless 
walked towards it, half because it might provide answers and half because another person was 
apparently there, and the thought of only having the apparently talking Witch Blade for 
company for possible eternity wasn’t her idea of a good afterlife.</p><p>“Who was that?” 
asked Masane.</p><p><i>“My mother, Angelus.”</i></p><p><i>“Angelus?”</i></p><p><i>“Yes, 
Masane. She’s my mom, and maybe we can both get the answers we seek if we speak with 
her.”</i></p><p><i>“What answers do you want?”</i></p><p><i>“With most bearers, I was able 
to talk with them and be their guide and companion. For reasons I don’t understand, I wasn’t 
able to speak to anyone for a long time and maybe Mother will know why.”</i></p><p>Masane 
continued walked forward, the light growing nearer and nearer. As it did, Masane realized 
the shapeless landscape was starting to gain definition. As the light grew more focused, the 
ground looked less like tile and more like grayed marble. Edifices resembling pillars shot 
up on either side of her path, and she could swear she heard the presence of other beings. 
She couldn’t see them, but the fact other beings aside from her now talkative gauntlet were 
around comforted her somehow. As she approached the source of the light, it dimmed 
considerably, and she finally saw the source.</p><p>Sitting on thrones of the same grayish 
substance that seemed to make up this whole realm were two figures, a male and a female, and 
both were as different as Night was from Day. Literally, it seemed, as the woman was under a 
huge splotch of light while the male was in a splotch of shadow. The woman had extreme 
brightness to her rather Amazonian (and somewhat skimpy angel like armor, far less than 
Masane thought her own covered) vestments. In fact, even her skin and platinum white hair 
seemed to glow with a light rivaling most movie sets. By contrast the male beside her, 
though she could see him clearly enough, was dark all over. His hair was jet black, his 
armor (oddly resembling the male equivalent to the woman’s garb, except had more of a 
gargoyle/demonic look) was shiny black like polished obsidian, and even his flesh was almost 
smoky in appearance. Both had a stern, imperious air about them, and judging by their 
musculature, Masane definitely got the idea pissing them off might not be a good idea, 
despite being possibly not dead. Nevertheless, both also had a shockingly beautiful 
appearance, with the woman (who Masane guessed correctly was Angelus) capable of making most 
mortal women pale by comparison, and the male being able to make most of those same mortal 
women start uncontrollably drooling.</p><p>At any rate, as she approached, the Witch Blade 
called out, “<i>Mother! Father!”</i></p><p>“Welcome home, child.” said the woman, whose 
voice was equally stern and loving.</p><p>“It gladdens this dark domain to have the beacon 
of your presence, son.” said the male, whose own voice was deep but surprisingly 
kindly.</p><p>With that, Masane felt both of them look directly at her, and possibly because 
of the whole regal setting, she got the urge to kneel. As she did, however, both of them 
gently laughed.</p><p>“Rise, Masane Amaha. You stand in the presence of the Keeper of Order, 
the Angelus, and you honor her with your presence.”</p><p>“And I, the Darkness, the Keeper 
of Chaos, am also honored by the presence of she who has honored unto death the compact with 
our child.”</p><p>To that, Masane felt a profound sense of relief that the parents of the 
Witchblade apparently thought she was a good person, so she rose. However, they said she had 
died.</p><p>“So………does my presence before you mean that I have truly left life?” was her 
trembling question, wondering if she was showing enough respect.</p><p>“As your mortal 
perspective interprets it.” was Angelus reply.</p><p>“However, your time to walk the Earth 
has yet to end.” countered Darkness.</p><p>“What do you-” was all Masane could say, before 
Angelus held up her hand and simply bade her to listen.</p><p>“For millennia, Man has sought 
Power, and has alternatively tried to disturb and maintain the balance between Order and 
Chaos. Being their embodiment, we decided long ago that if Man did not have a guardian to 
check his actions, then the balance between Order and Chaos would fall aside, and Man would 
destroy himself and all he was given. To that end, we sired the Witch Blade, a fusion of 
mine and Darkness’ nature to serve those amongst your kind who proved worthy of his power 
and who would help those whose hearts were judged clean of taint to maintain the 
Balance.”</p><p>Darkness picked up from there, “However, in recent times, those amongst Man 
who did not respect this compact abused the knowledge given them by their Creator, and 
Trespassed against the very Balance we sought to maintain, and our anger burned fiercely 
against humanity as result.”</p><p>As Darkness fell silent, Masane asked, “Do you mean those 
who tried to copy the Witch Blade for evil ends?”</p><p>Angelus again: “Precisely. Man in 
his arrogance decided to make bastard childer of our own child to satiate his own greed and 
lust for Power, and made grotesque abominations that flouted the compact between us. It was 
this that caused our anger to burn in what you know as the Great Quake, with which we showed 
your kind our displeasure. This, unfortunately, led us to become trapped in this realm, 
unable to change further events, though that circumstance was not entirely of our own 
will.”</p><p>Masane wondered what she meant by that, but decided not to 
interrupt.</p><p>Darkness continued, “We had been so angered by the abuse of our child we 
decided to punish Man for the suffering he had wrought. The abominations known as Clone 
Blades and I-Weapons were struck with incapacitation and madness, and the days of those who 
used their powers were cursed to far shorter days than the rest of your kind. And to our 
later regret, our anger poisoned us to such lengths that even the legitimate bearers of our 
child were damned to the same curse, which we sincerely ask forgiveness for.”</p><p>Again, 
they fell silent, and Masane, having finally put together the pieces, realized that they 
were responsible for her being blessed with suck, and despite the Witch Blade warning her 
mentally not to say anything, she spat out,</p><p>“So, you two are the reason I was 
condemned to die and separated from Riko, is that it?”</p><p>Angelus and Darkness’ eyes 
burned for a second, causing Masane to cower for a second, but then they relaxed, and 
Darkness even gave a sympathetic smile as he said, “Masane, I said we regret 
it.”</p><p>Angelus picked up from there, her face serene once more, “And so, when you became 
chosen, you originally were no better than the rest of Man in our eyes. It was to our 
surprise that you not only honored our child with not only following the compact to never 
hurt the innocent, you also refused to allow him to suffer further abuse. As parents 
ourselves, you have our gratitude.”</p><p>“Well, what can I say? My proudest moment in life 
was raising a little girl and being her mother. I’d do anything for a child, even one that 
wasn’t mine.”</p><p>Darkness again, “Well said, Bearer. It is due to that ultimate loyalty 
that not only have you allowed us to forgive Man, but for that very love that motivated you 
to the ultimate sacrifice, you shall be honored by being returned to your daughter, and you 
shall be able to honor your promise to be her protector.</p><p>As Masane’s mouth fell open 
in shock, she heard the Witch Blade in her mind, <i>“I guess that answers most of my 
questions.”</i></p><p>Angelus spoke again, this time to her child, “You shall return with 
Masane to the human realm. It was during the time of the curse on her kind your mouth was 
stayed, but since she has proven herself worthy, you will remain by her side, as she has a 
new task she will be required to perform in our service, and you shall be her 
guide.”</p><p>“What must I do?” was all Masane could say, willing to do anything to see her 
daughter again.</p><p>Darkness: “You fought against the madness of Man’s Trespass. However, 
not all of his perversions had been stopped, and their continued existence is a stench in 
our nostrils.”</p><p>Masane got it at once, “The ExCons.”</p><p>Angelus: “Correct. They must 
be eliminated for Man’s penance to finally be paid in full, and your life is returned to you 
as a covenant between us that you will carry out this mission.”</p><p>“If it means I see 
Rihoko again, I will do as you command.”</p><p>Darkness: “That is well and good, but you 
will not do this great task alone. Other humans have need to square the debt of Trespass 
with us, and you will command them in our service as redemption for their sin.”</p><p>As he 
spoke, she saw lights shoot up from the floor in the throne room, and inside of them were 
various women, naked as they day they were born, and as she saw them float inside the lights 
like ghastly, ethereal ornaments, understanding hit her like a brick.</p><p>“The 
Neogenes?!?!”</p><p>Angelus again, this time barely concealing her rage, “Yes. Distaff 
bastards created by that madman who dared call himself “Father”. These souls were to be used 
to attempt to violate the compacts between body and soul, and their very existence is an 
abomination. It is only because they were but mere pawns that we grant them any 
largesse.”</p><p>Darkness: “And most of those will remain here, paying their penance for 
their complicity in Trespass by becoming soldiers in our service, while we grant you those 
who bear the heaviest of sins as your allies. Their sins are great, thus their payment must 
be great as well, and thus they must personally aid thee in your mission, and power will be 
given to you to stay theirs if they prove disobedient.”</p><p>As he said this, Angelus, her 
voice somewhat milder, “Though we are not totally without heart. Some of those who the human 
Furumizu was to pervert into abominations were true innocents, such as infants and children, 
and their souls have been freed to be reborn without his taint on their minds and bodies. 
Those innocents aside, we will present those whose penance must be paid before us, and if 
they accept your command they will purge their sins as warriors with you as their liege and 
you as our vassal.”</p><p>With that, a bolt of light shot up from the floor in front of 
Masane, and a naked human woman tumbled out. As the light faded, Masane realized who she 
was.</p><p>“Reina…?”</p><p>To that, Reina Sohou looked up, and saw the crimson haired, black 
armored visage of Masane looking back, eyes wide with shock, and to Masane’s shock, Reina 
immediately turned downcast, facedown against the floor as if trying to hide, even putting 
her arms over her head, as if cowering. As she did this, Masane noticed the Clone Blade was 
no longer on her right wrist.</p><p>To Masane’s shock, Angelus made a sweeping motion with 
her hand, and Reina’s body flew upright like a puppet yanked forcefully by the base of its 
strings, her arms pulled away as they hung before her from the outside force on her form so 
Masane could see her hidden face, which was lined with shame.</p><p>Darkness’ voice roared 
“ERASE YOUR SELF PITY MORTAL! FACE THE TRUE BEARER WITH DIGNITY!”</p><p>At that, the light 
faded, and Reina’s body was lowered to the ground, where she quickly forced herself to stand 
upright.</p><p>“Masane………………is Rihoko alright?”</p><p>Masane, without skipping a beat, 
replied, “I died to ensure that.”</p><p>Reina’s former shamed face, despite herself, broke 
into a smile, “Thank you, Masane.”</p><p>Angelus: “Turn around, Reina Sohou.”</p><p>Reina 
complied. As she did, Angelus continued, “Reina Sohou, you are guilty of perverting the 
power of the Witch Blade to the greedy purposes of Man, and normally your soul would be 
forever damned. However, since your heart turned away from Madness and you fought to protect 
an innocent before your soul was forever forfeit you now stand before the parents of the 
very bauble you had a hand in defiling. We would show you clemency and allow you a chance to 
expiate your sin.”</p><p>Darkness: “To do this, however, you must not only swear allegiance 
to us, and you must accept Masane Amaha as your liege and follow her command, for she is a 
vassal unto our service. We grant you your life and the right to the Power you once wielded 
fraudulently in exchange for your loyalty to the True Bearer’s mission of eliminating every 
last abomination you once had a hand in creating.”</p><p>He paused for a moment; letting the 
gravity of his words hang like a cloud before saying gravely,</p><p>“Do you accept the terms 
of your clemency?”</p><p>Seemingly unmindful of her nakedness, she bowed, “Lady Angelus, 
Lord Darkness, I swear it. I swear to follow your will and serve Masane in the task of 
eliminating the remnants of my sins, and those sins shall never be repeated.”</p><p>Angelus 
voice, now sounding much milder, “Rise then, and accept the Blade you once wore, but wear it 
now in the service of Justice.” As Reina stood before Angelus, she grabbed Reina’s wrist, 
and a bolt of ruby lightning engulfed Reina’s body as she transformed into the form she had 
once had in life, her nakedness now covered by Witch Blade armor.</p><p>As Angelus let go, 
Masane could see the gauntlet on Reina’s wrist now glowed red instead of blue. “Now go stand 
by Masane, and await our instruction.”</p><p>Reina bowed once more and walked over to 
Masane’s side. As she did, Masane told her, “Reina, when we get back, I want you to know 
your own daughter again.” As Reina stood by Masane, she sounded as if she were fighting 
tears as said, in a voice barely above a whisper,</p><p>“I’d like that.”</p><p>Scarcely had 
they time to finish this discourse before another jet of light shot up in front of them, and 
a second human form fell forwards, and Reina was the one to gasp this time as she recognized 
her own blood.</p><p>“Maria………”</p><p>At the mention of her name, the mauven haired young 
lady looked up long enough to see her killer and her mother, and like Reina, tried to bury 
her face into the ground. Masane twitched; fearing Angelus and Darkness would show their 
wrath once more, but to her surprise, though she was forced upright, Angelus actually 
stepped forward from her throne and gently hugged the girl, saying gently,</p><p>“We forgive 
you, child.”</p><p>Maria actually looked up at this, and Angelus helped her to her feet as 
she sat back down and continued, “We chose to show you mercy even before your soul crossed 
this plain. In fact, you have already paid some of your penance.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” 
As she said this, both Masane and Reina realized the deranged edge that used to tinge 
Maria’s voice was now gone.</p><p>Darkness: “You slew Furumizu. His crimes were already 
beyond counting, and you served him judgment. For that, we thank you. As it was also true 
your mind was not your own and had been warped beyond understanding, and we were forced to 
consider that you were not entirely able to truly decide right and wrong of your own 
volition. Thus, we would return you to the human realm to live the life you were once 
cheated from, in exchange for paying your remaining penance by aiding the True Bearer in her 
mission.”</p><p>Maria nodded, realizing their logic made sense.</p><p>Angelus: “As you have 
heard us say to your mother, do you swear to abide by the same compact and assist Masane in 
her mission?”</p><p>“Might I speak to them first?” was Maria’s response, almost in an 
inaudible whisper.</p><p>Angelus looked perturbed, but Darkness made a sweeping gesture, as 
if to say, “So be it.”</p><p>As Maria turned towards them, Masane already knew why she was 
hesitating, and stepped aside so she and Reina could talk. No sooner had she done this Maria 
broke wind for her mother, who was frankly surprised to have the same person who had killed 
her in life sob in her arms and beg her for forgiveness in death. As Maria cried, begging 
her forgiveness, Reina had decided to give it. Masane had shown her mercy, as had Angelus 
and Darkness. Why shouldn’t she?</p><p>That said, she hugged her now sane and sobbing 
daughter and whispered in her ear, “Maybe we can get to be mother and daughter this 
time.”</p><p>At that, someone might as well have played a record stopping sound, because the 
sobbing ceased immediately. Maria then gently disengaged herself from Reina and nearly 
tripped over her own feet as she knelt before Angelus and said solemnly,</p><p>“I swear 
it.”</p><p>Angelus actually smiled at her as she grabbed Maria’s wrist, and she too gained 
her former Blade (singular), this one also glowing red instead of blue. As she finished 
resuming her old form, she actually walked back to where Masane and Reina stood without 
prompting, and as she took her place between Masane and her mother, she whispered, to 
Masane, “I guess I’m the subordinate this time.”</p><p>Masane didn’t have time to reply 
before the light pillar arrived again, and another female form fell at her feet, this one 
she didn’t immediately recognize, though Maria did, her voice almost a faint gasp as she 
said,</p><p>“Aoi.”</p><p>Though it was obvious the girl heard Maria, and had indeed even 
looked up at her with hope, it was also obvious she had heard what had gone on before and 
remained silent, her eyes never leaving Maria for a second.</p><p>In response, Darkness, to 
Angelus’ rather visible annoyance, merely asked, “Aoi Nagisa, do you swear to aid the true 
bearer as your penance?” To this, Aoi turned around, assumed a knelt position on one knee, 
and said in a tearful voice, “As long as this means a chance to rejoin Lady Maria’s side, I 
pledge myself to yours and Masane’s service.”</p><p>Angelus couldn’t hide a look of stunned 
surprise at just how easily that went, which made Masane feel a distinct urge to grin (which 
she wisely suppressed after the Witch Blade told her Mom didn’t take kindly to being laughed 
at), and merely ushered Aoi over to her, where she too received her Blade (singular), and 
after she got her armor back, she actually ran for Maria, hugging her like a child would 
their favorite teddy bear. Despite the somberness of just what was going on, all the adult 
sentient beings physically present all looked on with a smile, actually delighting in the 
happiness.</p><p>After Aoi let go and stood with the others, Darkness actually made a 
gesture like he was filing his nails, and Angelus had something of a wry look on her face. 
Alas, the comedy then abruptly ended, as another pillar of light appeared, and other woman 
tumbled out like a crumpled hanky at Masane’s feet. This time, it was Reina who almost had a 
coronary as said woman’s identity occurred to her.</p><p>“Sh-Shiori……………”</p><p>Although it 
was bluntly obvious by now that she had been privy to what had gone one with the others, she 
apparently either was gutsier than her predecessors or just not in possession of a cowardice 
response as she stared at Reina as if she were second coming of God and 
stammered,</p><p>“L-Lady Reina, y-you’re here!”</p><p>Reina, not wishing for Shiori to incur 
any wrath, quietly ordered, though not unkindly, “Face Lord Darkness and Lady Angelus. Show 
them the same respect you would afford me.”</p><p>Immediately, Shiori turned around and 
bowed. Complying with Angelus’ order to rise, Darkness looked like he was fighting the urge 
to grin at how easy this was as he asked, “Shiori, do you pledge to honor Masane’s commands 
and be reborn in our service? In exchange, you will be paying your penance, and returned to 
life with the one you so dearly cherish.”, and it was obvious in his tone he thought that 
last sentence had probably been superfluous.</p><p>It was as if Darkness had just injected 
her full of speed, because Shiori couldn’t quit prostrating herself as she cried out 
joyfully, “By all means, my Lord and Lady!” At that moment, Angelus and Reina’s eyes met, 
both a little stunned by Shiori’s enthusiasm, and Darkness could be seen wearing the same 
smartass smirk that Takayama had used to piss off Masane every so often. Shiori then 
approached Angelus, who gave Shiori back her Blade, and just barely after being rearmed, 
turned into a blue blur that would’ve rivaled a certain hedgehog as she leapt at Reina and 
embraced her with such shameless abandon Aoi and Maria looked at her in awe, with Aoi 
wondering if she should be asking Shiori pointers on sycophancy.</p><p>As Reina was finally 
allowed up for air, one last jet of light shot up, and Maria and Aoi’s eyes widened as Asagi 
Watanabe tumbled out. Unlike her predecessors, she wasn’t carrying nearly as much earthly 
baggage (at not any that was readily apparent), so she merely had a stunned look as she saw 
the other Witch Blades. Maria, taking her cue from Reina, motioned for Asagi to turn around, 
who complied, and she bowed somewhat sloppily (as conformity had never been her strong suit 
in life), but Angelus and Darkness didn’t seem to mind, and in fact looked a little weary as 
Angelus merely sighed,</p><p>“Do you submit to our will?”</p><p>Asagi’s right eyebrow cocked 
upward as she blandly stated, “You mean do I pledge myself in your service, follow Masane’s 
orders, pay my penalty for using powers I should’ve have used without asking, and do so in 
exchange for a right to life again?” She actually waited a beat before continuing, “Sure, 
why not?”</p><p>Masane and Co. thought that was more than a little impertinent, but Angelus 
and Darkness looked barely phased as Angelus ushered for Asagi to approach her. She received 
her Blade (singular), and upon doing so, walked back to the others, and waited patiently. As 
she did, both Angelus and Darkness stood, and Darkness waved his hand, and the same lights 
they had seen before swirled around their bodies like a magically created helix as he 
intoned, “And now we send you back to the realm of your birth, with the full powers of Order 
and Chaos restored to your Blades. Honor the commandments to never hurt the innocent and 
eradicate evil, and destroy the last remnants of evil created by the Trespass!”</p><p>As the 
lights grew to strobe light intensity, Angelus’ voice could also be heard, “And aid those 
who still walk the Earth as victims of Furumizu to find their redemption in our service, and 
leave the cleansing of the tortured souls of the abominations of flesh in our 
hands!”</p><p>And as the light grew so powerful, all the Witch Blade bearers were forced to 
close their eyes, lest they be blinded,</p><p>the voices of Darkness and Angelus resounded 
as legion,</p><p>“AND GO FORTH, AS OUR WARRIORS, IN SERVICE TO THE MAINTENANCE OF THE HOLY 
BALANCE!!!”</p><p>And with that, the Witch Blades felt their hold on the Other Realm fade as 
they disappeared into the light.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Some time later……………</p><p>Angelus 
and Darkness, after having utilized their awesomeness (and drama skills) not too long ago, 
were now ruminating over what to do next.</p><p>They had considered simply leaving the Other 
Realm and enjoying Earth again, but considering that those who sealed them here were 
probably aware by now the seal was broken, that did not seem like a wise call, and besides, 
both of them realized that it would give the ones who sealed them here a great excuse to get 
paranoid, and figured it would be best not to stir that particular hornet’s nest. Having to 
spend a few years with each other (and managing to finally restrain their centuries long 
urges to rip each other’s faces off during their internment) had taught them the values of 
prudence.</p><p>They also had a lot they had to do, and given the neutrality and quiet of 
this dimension, it was ideal for their purposes, and since they had the other Neogenes (and 
fallen ExCons) they had to sort out, this was a perfect place to handle that task, and 
considering that they had already granted some of the Neogenes clemency, both were not 
ignorant of the fact they had a chance to possibly reform these would be genetic bastard 
children and hew them into a mighty army, which might serve to make sure further incidents 
like the one six years hence did not occur.</p><p>This decided, Darkness and Angelus decided 
they would begin this great work at once.</p>
