<h1>Priori Addendum (part 11 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../witchblade/index.html">Witchblade</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rpgingmaster.html">RPGing Master</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../witchblade/prioriadden-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><p>As Toijira watched the aftermath of the battle from the Dreizhen comm. center, he made a 
few mental notes.</p><p>First, he was going to ask what the hell Dante did to the ExCon. It 
had vanished, its signal had briefly reappeared on the edge of town, and then it had 
disappeared again. Second, the town had gotten used to the idea of the Witch Blades, but he 
was seriously considering getting the boy a Mahoken suit so he wouldn’t stand out too bad. 
As it was, the kid had just put on one hell of a light show, and though one could possibly 
BS the public into thinking it was Witch Blade related, Toijira wasn’t going to take chances 
and make sure that was the conveyed party line.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>As Asagi watched 
Dante land, she was ready to give him a piece of her mind.</p><p>She hadn’t seen him for a 
few days, and now she had seen him, he had apparently taken a level in badass. Not that she 
minded, but what the hell was he thinking by not telling her anything? However, she never 
got a chance to bitch him out before Masane got there first.</p><p>“Look, Dante, not that I 
mind you saved our asses, but what the hell did you just do?” As she said this, Asagi was 
wondering why the hell she hadn’t asked him where his new powers had come from, but she had 
to admit finding out what happened to Ouka was probably more important.</p><p>“I let her 
go.”</p><p>Asagi had the same “WTF” look on her face as Masane did at that 
point.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>“Uh, Kira, how much can I tell 
them?”</i></p><p><i>“It will probably be impossible to avoid delaying letting them know, so 
tell them about me and the powers I gave you. It would probably be best to inform them that 
Colonel Toijira is aware of your activities. As for me, I’ll explain everything to Migura. 
I’ll meet up with you later.”</i></p><p><i>“Got it.”</i></p><p>Dante stole a quick glance at 
Asagi, and he felt himself cringe as he realized she was pissed, which is why he told 
Masane, “I was under orders by Migura to keep my mouth shut, and I just got the green light 
to tell you guys the truth.</p><p>By the way, Colonel Toijira knew about this too, but he 
was ordered to stay quiet too.”</p><p>Masane looked stunned, “I………see.”</p><p>“Tell you 
what. Let’s get out of here before we attract a crowd, and I’ll explain 
everything.”</p><p>Ironically, as they all (now detransformed) made it back to Marry and 
Rihoko, Masane felt her cell phone chirp. It was Toijira.</p><p>“Major Amaha here.”</p><p>“I 
need you and the others to return to HQ ASAP. Make sure Dante is with you.”</p><p>“Slight 
problem, sir.”</p><p>“Explain.”</p><p>Masane informed him of how she got there, and Toijira 
replied,</p><p>“Understood. I’ll send some transportation your way, so wait 
there.”</p><p>“Yes Sir.”</p><p>With that, Toijira hung up, and Masane relayed this to the 
others, and asked Marry to take Rihoko home. As Marry left, she noticed that Asagi looked 
pretty steamed, and Dante looked liked he’d rather put his balls in a bench vise than talk 
to her at the moment. Neither was talking to each other at the moment, so Masane decided to 
stand between the two just in case any flare-ups happened. As they waited, Nora, Yagi, and 
Yuriko got their own RTB order from the Other Realm, and returned, while Darkness left 
Masane a quick memo to expect them at Marry’s sometime tomorrow morning, whereupon she was 
to help them get used to civilian life again.</p><p>Two Dreizhen logoed vans showed up and 
Asagi made a point of waiting until Dante boarded one, before she quite purposely boarded 
the other. As Masane joined her, she had to resist the urge to tell Asagi she was being a 
little petty.</p><p>“<i>Then again”</i>, she mused as they drove away, <i>“If Reiji was 
suddenly able to shoot lightning bolts out of his ass and didn’t tell me about it, I’d be 
pissed too.”</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>While they were going to ascertain truth, Migura 
had gone by himself to the Other Realm to find it out in a more direct manner.</p><p>To wit, 
he showed up, told the Witch Blades guarding the path to their surrogate mom and dad he 
needed to speak with them, and after they let him, he still noticed he was being watched 
like he was going to try something stupid once more, which merely made him feel like Dante’s 
opinion of the inflated paranoia had some merit to it.</p><p>At any rate, as soon as he 
stood in front of Darkness and Angelus, he surprised them by dropping to one knee like a 
servant and asked respectfully,</p><p>“Might I say something?”</p><p>Angelus was a little 
flabbergasted that Migura, of all people, was showing so much humility, so Darkness had to 
say,</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Continuing to fall on his sword, Migura admitted, “For a long 
time, I and the others have been frightened that you two were very angry with us, and that 
you hated the imprisonment we forced on you, and that you wanted revenge on us. I am here to 
admit that we did not trust your intentions.”</p><p>As Migura finished, he heard both 
Angelus and Darkness chuckle softly, with Angelus fighting the urge to erupt into full blown 
laughter as she said,</p><p>“We knew that already.”</p><p>Migura was stunned, but realized a 
second later he and his compatriots hadn’t really hid things all that well.</p><p>Darkness 
picked up from here, “And no, Migura, despite the fact we both contemplated brutally 
separating all of your spines and breaking your appendages off as trophies at one point, we 
aren’t going to. In fact, we got over any rage long ago.”</p><p>“Beg pardon?”</p><p>Angelus: 
“The imprisonment was good for us. We DID “go overboard” and use our power beyond what 
should have been prescribed, and while we were here, cool logic prevailed over our fiery 
tempers, and we came to the conclusion we probably did far more harm than good. During our 
fetterment, we looked upon all the parties involved, and we saw the plight of those called 
the Neogenes. They were innocents, and Masane’s would be death and the deeds of her life 
until she freed us had been in their defense, and we had been forced to remember it was they 
who suffered far more than we did, thus we abandoned our hatred.”</p><p>Migura had not been 
expecting Angelus and Darkness to be falling on their swords as well, so as he tentatively 
rose to a more dignified standing position, and he honestly started to admit, “In fact, we 
even contemplated spying-“</p><p>Darkness held up an amused hand. “Dante Long, 
right?”</p><p>Migura was stunned silent, which was answer enough.</p><p>Angelus picked up 
the baton, “But that plan seems to have been abandoned. Why?”</p><p>Migura gave them both an 
ironic look, “The boy I asked to spy on you told me it might be better to clear the air with 
you instead, and simply ask your intentions.”</p><p>Darkness: “Smart boy.”</p><p>Migura 
caught the implicit sarcasm in the remark, and kept his mouth shut. Obviously, Dante had 
been right, and he felt like a 400 year old paranoiac, which he was. Sure, most of the 
Thirteen had made a few concerned noises about possible reprisal, but looking back, he had 
made the majority, and now that he finally cleared the air with them and discovered he was 
wrong, he actually felt a little better that he had simply asked, instead of continuing 
“Poor Communication Kills”.</p><p>In fact, he was in for another surprise as a figure walked 
up to Darkness who looked like a mini Darkness, albeit Darkness had he been born as a 
Japanese mecha anime geek with unruly brown hair.</p><p>“So, Dad, who’s 
this?”</p><p>Darkness gestured grandly, “Lord Migura, this is my protégé, Kenichi Oka. 
Kenichi, this is Lord Migura of the Thirteen, and before you ask, they are part of the good 
guys.” Migura barely had time to be gratified to hear this when</p><p>Kenichi walked up and 
offered his hand, which Migura shook.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Migura-san. Darkness is not 
only like a second father to me, he’s the guy who rescued me from being a soulless killroid 
and let me be awesome instead, and he and Angelus-sama have done the same for all the other 
ladies here.”</p><p>As Kenichi said this, Migura looked around at the various Neogenes in 
Witch Blade armor, and was touched to see they looked content, happy, and free from want and 
fear. As he turned back around to face Darkness and Angelus, Darkness added,</p><p>“I 
believe you should know that we eventually plan to send them all back to Tokyo to not only 
aid Masane in her mission, but as much as we enjoy the company they provide, our transplant 
birds must leave this nest eventually and reembrace the lives taken from them.”</p><p>“I’m 
gratified to hear that, Darkness. I truly am.”</p><p>Angelus: “If you might tarry a bit 
longer, Migura, we would wish to inform you of the rest of our plans.”</p><p>“I am at your 
service, Angelus.”</p><p>Much later…………………</p><p>When he finally left, Migura was convinced 
of two things. One, he and the few others amongst his peers who shared his feelings had been 
dead wrong, and two, he had truly underestimated the effect that the cries of the innocent 
had against the rage of the powerful.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Back at 
Dreizhen…………………</p><p>Dante had made a point of staying as far away from Asagi as possible, 
and now they were all in Toijira’s office, giving a report on what had happened. The Colonel 
listened intently, then said,</p><p>“I see. Given the situation, I am hereby putting all of 
you on constant standby for Ouka Nagisa. While I’m confident that she is not a threat to 
herself or civilians given your reports, I am hereby making it an official directive for all 
of you to do whatever you can to peaceably detain her whenever she reappears. Based on the 
research data on the Clone Blades, repeated use causes breakdown as some of you know, and 
this could cause Ms. Nagisa to lose her sanity, which would make saving her near difficult 
to impossible, and given the fact it is still possible to save her I want all of you, Dante 
included, to remain on constant standby at all times, and if any of you spot her in either 
human or ExCon form you are to notify HQ immediately and do whatever you can to peaceably 
detain her.”</p><p>In response, a solemn chorus of “Sir!” resounded.</p><p>Toijira then 
turned his attention to Dante, and said, “Young man, as of this moment, under the authority 
given me by Lord Migura and your patron Kira, I am inducting you into our anti-ExCon forces 
here at Dreizhen with a simulated rank of Sergeant. You will report to Masane or to me, and 
from this point onward, you are bound by military regulations.”</p><p>Dante stood at 
attention, “Understood.”</p><p>“And, Sergeant Long, your first order is explain the 
circumstances of how you became an agent of the Thirteen for everyone else’s 
benefit.</p><p>Dante proceeded to do just that, carefully avoiding directly looking at Asagi 
as he did, though he noticed some of her temper bled off as he got to the parts where he was 
sworn to silence about his new powers and status. As he finished, Toijira picked up from 
there, “Now that you’ve heard what happened, I’m also making it known that as soon as the 
Mahoken power armor arrives; I’m issuing Dante one of them. Given that we remain committed 
to keeping any knowledge beyond what is already public secret for the public’s protection, 
I’d rather he look like a Witch Blade and blend in. Any questions?”</p><p>Shiori raised her 
hand, “Sir, I know Masane and Reiji met this Migura gentleman, and Dante and yourself have 
met the other Thirteen, but when do we get to meet them?”</p><p>“Good question, Lieutenant. 
I’ll see what I can do about arranging a meeting. Anything else?”</p><p>“No, 
sir!”</p><p>“Good. You may all, save Dante, go home now, but until Ouka Nagisa is found, you 
are all on constant standby until this situation is resolved. Dismissed.”</p><p>Everyone 
else filed out but Dante, who stole a quick look at Asagi, who looked slightly less pissed, 
to his relief. As soon as they were gone, Toijira told him to follow him. They left 
Toijira’s office and quickly found a small conference room. As Dante complied with Toijira’s 
order to sit at the head of the table, he remain standing, and Dante wisely decided to shut 
up while the Colonel proceeded to give the speech he’d been wanting to give, noting the man 
flipped a switch somewhere underneath the table that made a buzz emanate around the room, 
and didn’t speak till it was good and humming.</p><p>“Dante Long, unlike the Witch Blades, 
whom I only have semi-autonomous authority over, I’ve have been given complete authority 
over you, and when I said you were drafted, I meant it. And, that means I’ll be requesting 
some changes.”</p><p>“What changes are those, sir?”</p><p>“First, you look like a punk, and 
before you leave here, I’ll have one of our quartermaster’s issue you a proper uniform, and 
whenever possible, I want you to show up looking presentable, got it?”</p><p>Dante shook his 
head in acquiescence. He could see the Colonel’s point, and besides, he noticed the Witch 
Blades walked around in company logoed jackets when out of Witch Blade form, so not only was 
it reasonable, it wasn’t like he was being singled out.</p><p>“Next, just because you have 
super powers now doesn’t mean you can use them carelessly. I’m sure Kira read you the riot 
act, so I won’t repeat it. I will tell you this much, though. Migura has granted me power as 
well, and since the Thirteen aren’t around all the time, I will be responsible for your 
actions, and I don’t think I have to impress upon you how strongly I don’t like to look bad, 
do I?”, and as Toijira finished, Dante felt a chill. That had all been said in the voice a 
man would use to order breakfast, but the implication of the sheer hell he’d endure got 
through in the subtext, and though he was curious what powers Toijira had, he merely said, 
“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Finally, you are now under military regulations now. You will be issued a 
company cell phone I expect you to carry at all times, as it not only will be how we reach 
you, but also doubles as a tracking device so we know where you are in case you need to be 
bailed out of trouble. If it breaks, let us know and we’ll fix it, but don’t lose it or 
forget it. Also, you will let either me or Major Amaha know what your schedule is at all 
times. Considering the threat we face, your services may be required 24/7, so keep that in 
mind.”</p><p>“Yes, sir.”</p><p>“Excellent. I’ll be back with some forms for you to fill out, 
then you’ll be getting your gear issued before you leave.” and Toijira’s eyes widened as he 
realized he forgot something, and he asked,</p><p>“How much does your father know about your 
situation?”</p><p>“Kira and Migura filled him in about my powers and how I’m an agent of 
theirs who will be working with you, sir. He was authorized to inform Chief Nakata of this 
information, but no one else. He’s more than a little shocked, but understands my situation, 
and understood when I told him I might not be able to reveal all of my activities, 
sir.”</p><p>“That’s acceptable, Mr. Long. I’ll be calling your father personally to let him 
know you are now a simulated member of the JSDF, and considering the Tokyo Police liaise 
with us, any confidential information you are authorized to tell him may only be spread to 
others on my orders.”</p><p>“I understand, sir.”</p><p>“Good. Welcome to the team, 
Dante.”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>On the way home, Asagi was pretty quiet, and though it 
wasn’t hard to guess why, Masane decided to talk to her.</p><p>“Asagi-“</p><p>“Let me guess. 
I shouldn’t be pissed my boyfriend didn’t tell me he got a power up because he was ordered 
to keep his mouth shut, and I shouldn’t be upset given the circumstances, 
right?”</p><p>Masane’s tongue felt for the words that had been taken from her mouth as Asagi 
continued.</p><p>“Look, I’m not as upset as I look. Sure, I’m kinda frustrated he couldn’t 
tell me, but I’ll get over it, so no need to worry.”, and with that Asagi returned to her 
silence, thinking to herself,</p><p><i>“I now understand why Dante was asking me about my 
responsibility, and I really can’t fault him for having to keep his mouth 
shut.”</i></p><p>And with that, Masane returned to silence as well.</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>(The next day, morning)</p><p>Masane had been waiting for whenever Nora, Yagi, 
and Yuriko were going to show back up, and her impatience was getting to the point she was 
seriously considering taking the Witch Blade up on its offer to page its parents for a 
status update. She managed to restrain this urge, and tried to busy herself with recent 
events, of which there were many.</p><p>First, Marry had recently got a call from Naomi, who 
informed them that her mother was doing much better, and that she was wondering how they 
were. During the course of updating her, Masane sensed Naomi had something she wanted to 
ask, and called her out on it (the speakerphone was on). Naomi hesitantly asked if her old 
room was available, and though it wasn’t, Masane informed her that if they had to find 
another place, it wouldn’t be too hard. After, being the battle commander of a military 
sanctioned monster kill team paid well, and she was sure she had the clout to get or rent 
some choice housing, so if Naomi wanted to come back, all she had to do was say the word. 
Naomi thanked her for the gesture, and told Masane she was still going to be with her mother 
for a few more weeks, and Masane told her she’d be checking out alternative real estate. She 
also got a call from Michael, who had recently hooked up with some lucrative surfing group 
being sponsored by ESPN, and told them he had hit the big time and was now entering into an 
international surf-off somewhere around Thailand, even telling them what time and channel 
he’d be shown on. Everyone present congratulated him on moving up in the world and wished 
him well.</p><p>In other news, Asagi and Dante had kissed and made up. He actually had come 
over early in the morning, wearing official Dreizhen uniform, and bore a huge bouquet, which 
he had brought as an olive branch. Asagi had calmed down way before he showed up, but this 
merely clinched it, and when she asked him if he was going to get in trouble, he whipped out 
his official cell and showed her he messaged Toijira his location. He also learned who they 
were waiting for, and was currently waiting with them. In fact, all the Witch Blades, as 
well as Reiji, Yuusuke, Cho, and Marry were all waiting in the front of her establishment 
(closed for the day), waiting for their guests, and they were currently passing the time 
playing a game.</p><p>“Got any threes?” asked Yuusuke lazily.</p><p>In the same deadpan 
monotone Takayama reserved for long elevators and those times Masane got on his nerves, he 
said,</p><p>“Go fish.”</p><p>From where she was sitting, Reina suppressed a giggle behind 
her cards.</p><p>Rihoko then asked, “Any fours?”</p><p>Reiji handed her two.</p><p>“Thanks, 
Daddy.”</p><p>A few moments later, the room went deathly silent.</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>Across the street, hiding in a nearby alley, Ouka Nagisa was watching the people 
inside, wondering if she could muster up the courage to enter. She had been thinking about 
Dante’s words since yesterday, and she suddenly wanted so sure she wanted to end it all 
now.</p><p>In fact, now she was downright curious as to why everyone inside had suddenly 
frozen like statues.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Everyone in the room suddenly looked at Reiji 
(even Dante, who had been filled in by Asagi), who looked like his heart was lodged in his 
throat, and Rihoko………everyone that is save for Masane, who was thinking,</p><p><i>“I always 
kinda suspected Rihoko might have figured it out. Guess she just decided to come out and say 
it.”</i></p><p>As for Reina, she was thinking,</p><p><i>“I’m sure Reiji nor Masane ever told 
her, so how did she-“</i></p><p>“Well, he might as well be daddy, because both my birth mom 
and my current mom liked him a lot.” said Rihoko</p><p>in complete innocence, though her 
face was telling her mothers’ a completely different story.</p><p>With an amazing amount of 
tact, Takayama (and everyone save the two mothers slowly exhaled), while both mothers shared 
a mutual look of,</p><p><i>“She knows.”</i></p><p>Before anyone else could say anything 
though, they saw a bright flash from upstairs, and Shiori deftly changed the 
subject,</p><p>“I think our guests have arrived.”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>At 
Dreizhen……………</p><p>Toijira had just rung up his boss to give him the latest status 
report.</p><p>“The R&D department informed me the Mahoken (Light) Power Suits are ready for 
production status, and the (Heavy) suits are almost ready for combat trials. The first two 
dozen have arrived, and I’m having some of my senior NCO’s train in their use, so I can have 
some instructors ready when the rest of the garrison here receives their 
own.”</p><p>“Understood, Toijira-san. I recently met up with Darkness and Angelus, and it 
seems any fears of any reprisal were grossly magnified, and I was thinking it might be best 
if we can all arrange to get together to put any remaining issues at rest, and to borrow an 
American idiom, “make sure we’re all singing out of the same hymnal”.</p><p>“Couldn’t agree 
more, sir. In fact, Lieutenant Tsuzuki suggested much the same thing, and I concur myself. 
As I understand it, Masane has connection to myself and the Other Realm, you have a 
connection to all three of us, and they have a connection to the Witch Blades, so sir, I 
suggest that since you are able to interface with all three parties, partially through the 
agency of myself, you should handle the Other Realm end, and I’ll handle this 
end.”</p><p>“Good idea. How’s your current situation?”</p><p>“Not good, sir. We have a rogue 
ExCon who we don’t believe is a danger to civilians and is in fact capable of being saved, 
but the problem is finding her.”</p><p>“I see. I’ll be working on the former issue for now, 
and we’ll postpone any meeting until your situation is resolved.”</p><p>“Understood, 
sir…………and now that I think about it, three more Witch Blades have shown up, apparently on 
our side.”</p><p>“I’m well aware. As I understand it, Darkness and Angelus are letting some 
of them return, under the explicit proviso they follow Masane’s orders, which in turn means 
they will follow yours.”</p><p>“Good to know, sir.”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, back 
at Marry’s, everyone else was (re)meeting Nora, Yagi, and Yuriko.</p><p>“Don’t know if you 
been informed, but we’re going to be here on a permanent basis”, said Nora after the 
reintroductions.</p><p>Yagi added, “Colonel Toijira knows we’re here. Also, aside from 
possibly getting Yuriko reacquainted with civilian life again, we’re kinda at square 
one.”</p><p>“So let me get this straight. You guys don’t have any money, place to stay, or 
anything else?” was Masane’s query, prompting Nora to gesture to herself and snarkily 
reply,</p><p>“You’re looking at what little we have and I don’t think it’d be a good idea to 
walk around with a draft hitting our asses 24/7.”</p><p>Maria gave her a sardonic look, “Let 
me guess. You’d be violating decency laws if you detransformed right now.”</p><p>“Pretty 
much.”</p><p>A few moments of silence, then Reina spoke up, proposing that Reiji inform 
Toijira of the situation, while the rest of them helped the new arrivals get some street 
attire. The only parties who didn’t get marching orders were Aoi, Maria, Rihoko and Dante, 
who quietly headed downstairs until the guests were more presentable. Meanwhile, Yuusuke 
told Yagi to follow him and he’d lend him some clothes, while Nora was escorted to 
Reina/Shiori’s room, while Yuriko was escorted to Marry/Asagi’s room. Cho, lacking any 
decent line of BS to attempt gaining ingress to either of the new ladies’ rooms, decided to 
head downstairs as well, back to his hacker cave.</p><p>Nora was currently trying on one of 
Reina’s business suits, and as she got dressed, she said,</p><p>“I know it’s a little late 
to say this, but I understand why you had to kill me.”</p><p>Shiori saw Reina tense up a 
little, but she relaxed as she told Nora’s back,</p><p>“I’m sorry anyway.”</p><p>As Nora 
turned around, having finished buttoning up her blouse, she told Reina, “I’m glad neither of 
us has to kill each other again. We are Sisters, right?”</p><p>Reina nodded, and Nora 
lowered her voice as she asked,</p><p>“Is Maria…………better now? She looks a lot less immature 
than before.”</p><p>“She grew up, Nora, and finally got to know what a normal life means………” 
replied Reina, who suddenly had her face cloud up. Shiori moved over to guide her over to 
the edge of their bed, and Nora told her,</p><p>“I don’t know what this is worth, Reina, but 
I grew up too. While working with Lady Angelus, I learned that the way I merely followed 
Furumizu’s orders wasn’t an excuse for my actions, and I’m sorry for any pain I caused 
you.”, and with those words, she sat down on Reina’s other side, and after she got Shiori to 
silently nod her permission, gave Reina a hug, which she was gratified to see was returned, 
thought she quickly disengaged the second Shiori started looking jealous.</p><p>As for Yagi, 
he was in Yuusuke’s room, trying to fit into one of Yuusuke’s suits, and finding it a tad 
difficult because he wasn’t nearly as lanky as the PR guy. As he kept playing mix and match, 
Yuusuke sat on the bed holding conversation with the former salary man.</p><p>“So, you used 
to be a Douji wage slave, huh?”</p><p>“Yeah. I was the kiss up to that smug snake 
Wadou.”</p><p>“That oily looking guy who hated Takayama’s guts?”</p><p>“The very same. The 
reason I’m a Witch Blade now was because he got pissed one day, and used me as a test 
subject for an experimental variant on the Clone Blade.”</p><p>“We seized some records on 
that. What happened?”</p><p>“Long story short, he was pissed one day, and had me more or 
less knocked out, fitted with his customized Clone Blade, and then I was mind screwed into 
becoming his personal, magically enhanced assassin. He then sent me out to kill 
Takayama-san.”</p><p>“And Masane had to kill you?”</p><p>“Unfortunately, yes, as I was an 
ExCon in all but name. Thankfully, my soul was saved by the creators of the Witch Blade, who 
gave me a second chance, which I took, and even though the Blade is usually meant for women, 
they gave me a male modified variant when I told them I wanted to go back to Earth and start 
killing ExCons to make up for helping that prick.”</p><p>“Don’t blame you in the least, 
man.”</p><p>“By the way, is Hiroki Segawa still around?”</p><p>“Yeah. We don’t see each 
other a lot, but he works as the company liaison guy.”</p><p>“Same job, more 
responsibility?”</p><p>“Pretty much. In fact, he was actually working as a mole for the JSDF 
from the beginning, and he’s the reason they took over Douji and are now helping out with 
the ExCons.”</p><p>As Yagi finally found a suit coat that didn’t rob his joints of their 
bending abilities, he told Yuusuke,</p><p>“You know, I used to be a professional kiss ass, 
but now that I’m working for the good guys, I don’t plan to be anyone’s stepping stool ever 
again.”</p><p>Yuusuke held up his hands, “No need to convince me. And, if it makes you feel 
any better, your former boss is now in a mental institution.”</p><p>To his surprise, Yagi’s 
face softened as he asked,</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“Long story short, he had a mental 
breakdown when he realized he was the idiot who deep sixed Douji and was responsible for the 
I Weapons going nuts.”</p><p>“I see. I hope he gets better.”</p><p>That surprised Yuusuke, 
and Yagi noticed and elaborated,</p><p>“Despite what he did to me, I don’t want him to 
suffer, and believe it or not, while I resent him for treating me like shit he’s a human 
being like I am. I just hope that when he recovers he finally acknowledges 
that.”</p><p>Meanwhile, with Masane and Yuriko…………</p><p>Whereas Yuusuke was too lanky, 
Masane’s outfits were baggy as hell. Yuriko found that most of Masane’s outfits DEFINETLY 
were way too large (on her) in the chest area, and while Yuriko searched for something that 
didn’t feel like a body sock, Masane engaged her in conversation.</p><p>“How does it feel to 
be back?”</p><p>“Well, now that I have my family back, and I’m doing something to make up 
for all the suffering caused by Fa-Furumizu and Douji, I have a purpose as 
well.”</p><p>“That’s good to hear. What are you going to do now?”</p><p>“Well, on top on 
helping all of you out, I’m also going to see how Kaede-obasan is doing and let her know I’m 
okay, and see if I can go back to working in the flower shop with her.”</p><p>Yuriko had 
finally found something suitable to wear as she said this, and as she shrugged into the 
elastic bound sweater-shirt, she found she had to tuck it into her waist and cinch it with a 
belt, as she was skinnier around the waist than Masane. As she was doing this, she asked 
Masane,</p><p>“I was wondering…………would you like to meet her sometime?”</p><p>“Sure thing. 
Why?”</p><p>“Well, Kaede-obasan was always worried I wouldn’t make friends, and I wanted her 
to know I finally have.”</p><p>Downstairs………………</p><p>As Reiji got off the phone, he noticed 
Rihoko and the others resuming the card game from earlier. As he tried not</p><p>to draw 
attention to himself, he kept looking at Rihoko, wondering if she really did know, and if 
so, could he really muster the balls to finally admit he was her father?</p><p>The one thing 
that had kept him from admitting that fact to her was, bluntly put, shame. He was ashamed 
his conscience had been at such a nadir at one point he couldn’t bring himself to even see 
if the little girl he fathered with Reina was alright, and even though she had been better 
than alright all this time, he was ashamed he hadn’t had a hand in that, and even now, he 
was wondering if he could ever force himself to work past his fear, tell his daughter the 
truth, and beg her forgiveness for not being in her life. He had had feeling for her birth 
mother, now her adoptive mother, and while had been able to be honest in those cases, he 
felt like a scumbag for not being able to openly tell his own child he cared.</p><p>He was 
thankfully spared anymore beating himself up when everyone showed up downstairs later, and 
they headed for Dreizhen. However, that still didn’t make him feel like any less of a 
pathetic excuse for a parent.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Soon after they arrived inside 
Dreizhen, a seedy looking bald jackass with slanted eyebrows and stereotypical “evil vizier” 
goatee watched from a spot across the street from some bushes, snarling as he watched a very 
familiar gentleman enter the place he still referred to as Douji.</p><p>In life, he had been 
a mid level Douji executive, just high enough on the food chain he knew enough about Douji’s 
dirty laundry and had some clout, but low enough his paycheck wasn’t up to the same 
standard, and considering he was a grasping opportunist who privately bitched more than 
Rodney Dangerfield about getting no respect back in the day (to wit, around the same time 
Ouka had been jacked and ExConned), he had decided his dignity was low enough he’d double 
deal his bosses and sell the blueprints to their untrustworthy clients in lieu of the 
finished product. Not only was he stupid enough not to cover his tracks, he had no clue he 
was the unwitting stooge in a sting set up to smoke out disloyal employees, and the guys he 
arranged to sell the blueprints to were actually Douji heavies who repaid his treachery with 
death. Once his ass was post mortem, they faked a suicide note and a gas explosion in his 
residence to make sure his disappearance would slip under the radar, then they threw his 
body into the ExCon maker. He was also fitted with one of the more stable blades (before his 
former employers became cheap asses), and much like Ouka, he too was a zombie who had only 
recently regained his memories, and as soon as he figured out who and what he was, he wanted 
to fuck up those Douji bastards for what they did to him, and even though he was well aware 
of the anti-ExCon death squad running around, he at least wanted to kill one of the fuckers 
responsible for turning him into some jacked up cross between Jason Voorhees and a humanoid 
ED-209.</p><p>Sadly for our psychopath, almost all of those assholes had decided to flee and 
leave Wadou and the lower ranks to take the rap for their misdeeds when it all when to hell 
and the I-Weapons went insane, so virtually all of the suits were unable to be located. The 
few Douji guys left boiled down to three candidates: Wadou, who was currently still 
recovering from going utterly bat shit in a secure psychiatric ward, Hiroki Segawa, whom our 
former Douji man figured wasn’t responsible for Douji’s BS (and was ironically right), so 
that left Reiji Takayama as the only guy left on the hit list.</p><p>He had come to this 
decision almost immediately after he was to remember everything. In fact, soon after 
regaining his memories (juxtaposed with the now public information on the ExCons) he had 
first devoted himself to keeping his sanity so that he might one day unleash his rage on the 
appropriate targets, then he decided to score what little vengeance he could, whenever that 
opportunity presented itself, and recently, he had been stalking Reiji, narrowing down his 
day to day pattern, waiting for the chance he was alone so he might have enough time to make 
one of the former top echelon Douji pigs suffer for the hell he was currently 
living.</p><p>After watching the man reenter the former Douji complex, the ExCon decided to 
wait quietly until it got a chance to figure out where the SOB slunk off after being the 
military’s bitch. As he did, he had no idea that someone else had a very similar hiding 
place, but a drastically different motive.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside the 
building………………………</p><p>Toijira had heard about Nora, Yagi, and Yuriko’s situation, and he 
proposed that, in the interim, the first two could accept rooms provided on the military 
account until housing arrangements could be made, and since Takayama’s former company digs 
still stood (now owned by the JSDF), he suggested that as a good place to start. Toijira 
agreed, though when Reiji added that the place was really small and had only one bed, he 
(along with everyone else) had to choke back a laugh as Nora and Yagi looked at each other 
lecherously and said that wouldn’t be a problem. As for Yuriko, Toijira had allowed her to 
call Kaede-obasan, who on top of being overjoyed to hear Yuriko was alright now, told her 
she didn’t mind providing her a place to stay, and when Toijira politely informed the old 
woman of the fact Yuriko was not going to be able to share some things with her, due her job 
responsibilities, she informed him she understood, and that she’d just be happy to have 
Yuriko around to brighten up her life again.</p><p>After that was settled, he had some 
Dreizhen soldiers escort Nora, Yagi, and Yuriko to the Dreizhen quartermasters for their 
standard issue uniforms and cell phones, before driving them to their respective 
destinations, along with the assurances that more permanent financial and other arrangements 
would be worked on ASAP. As they left, the remaining members of the team (Dante included) 
were given their marching orders,</p><p>“I’ll have Nora, Yagi, and Yuriko join you in this 
order when they are sufficiently squared away, but for now your orders are as follows: 
Unless another ExCon attacks, you are to consider yourself on standby for now, but any sight 
of Ouka Nagisa is to be reported to me and original orders regarding her situation still 
apply. I believe we have some time before we have to worry about her Clone Blade breaking 
down and causing her to destabilize, but the sooner she’s found and recovered the better. 
Questions?”</p><p>There were none.</p><p>He then turned to Yuusuke, “We need to inform the 
public about the recent ExCon incidents, and the fact three new Witch Blades have joined our 
forces. Tell Cho to see what he can do to dig up any of Yagi, Yuriko or Nora’s former assets 
or records, if any, so that we can integrate them into society better.”</p><p>“Will do, 
sir.”</p><p>Next, he turned to Reiji, “At the end of this week, I’m going to give you some 
time off, but for now, I’m going to need your presence here. You knew Yagi from his days 
here at Douji, and considering he’s currently considered a former Douji man on probation, I 
want you to work with Yuusuke to assure the public he, Nora, and Yuriko are in the same 
position of working with us to make up for their former affiliations.”</p><p>He then 
addressed the Witch Blades, “I understand all of you were acquainted with one or more of the 
new arrivals. I’ll be needing all of you to help us sketch together profiles of their roles 
in the service of either Douji or the NSWF. That, combined with their own testimony, will 
help us establish their credibility and help Reiji and Yuusuke prove to the public they’re 
the good guys. I’m not exactly convinced it’s entirely necessary to go that far, but 
considering the cloak and dagger bullshit many of the suits who used to reside in this 
building were party too, complete disclosure in this case would help the public understand 
those foolish and deadly mistakes are not going to be repeated.”</p><p>There was a general 
nod of assent from all present, especially Yuusuke, who’s already high respect for Toijira’s 
integrity just raised another notch.</p><p>That said he wrapped up the meeting with, “One 
last thing. I just talked with Migura about getting us all together in one place so that we 
can all get on the same page and all sides in this war against the ExCons can be assured 
we’re all on the same side and that we share a common goal. He and the other members of the 
Thirteen are planning to ask Darkness and Angelus about this, and presuming they agree, 
we’ll be getting together sooner or later. Once that is ironed out, I’ll inform all of 
you.”</p><p>He paused, and then asked, “Anything else that needs mentioning?”</p><p>The 
silence was deafening.</p><p>“Then that’s all. Dismissed.”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(Several 
days later)</p><p>A lot of productivity and nothingness happened over the next few days. For 
the sake of shortness, the nothingness was the failure to locate Ouka Nagisa. In retrospect, 
this was because she was actually hovering around the general area of Marry’s, maintaining 
an absurdly low profile, and she was so good at this that the best efforts of the Witch 
Blades simply missed her.</p><p>Besides, who hides in plain sight?</p><p>Also, it must be 
mentioned that irony was having fun with their search, for as they wanted to finish making 
sure Dante’s lesson about having some worth to her life stuck, Ouka was coming to that 
realization herself, and she spent most of the intervening week trying to screw up the 
courage to face the True Bearer and her Sisters, while realizing that she probably didn’t 
want to die. After all, killing that bastard who wanted to hurt children had given her one 
hell of a reason why her presence was worth it to some degree (now she was thinking 
straight) and her resolve to simply capitulate and accept redemption was waxing ever 
stronger by the day, and every night, she continued to watch the storefront of Marry’s, 
seeing the happiness within, and like the snowman who kept enviously looking at the light 
and warmth inside, she too found the temptation to join it grow stronger as the week went 
by.</p><p>As for what the Witch Blades accomplished, it was actually useful. Nora and Yagi 
got an apartment, and Yuriko moved in with Kaede. Courtesy of all the records Reiji, Yuusuke 
and Cho were able to salvage, it was easy to establish official civilian identities for the 
three of them (though since Yagi had never been officially declared legally dead, he was the 
easiest to get reintegrated). By this point they had all reentered the human race and they 
had all contributed to filling in some more holes as to the activities of Douji and the 
NSWF, and their testimony was added to the material Dreizhen already had on record for when 
they finally caught a former Douji/Child Services executive and were ready to legally 
prosecute them.</p><p>Also, a certain former Douji executive/ExCon had been staking out 
Marry’s, again showing just as much caution as Ouka not to be detected, and when the bulk of 
the Witch Blades left one evening (to give their progress report on their LACK of progress 
finding Ouka), he decided to make his move.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The ExCon had waited 
until the Witch Blade signals were gone (a process that took about twenty or so minutes), 
then he examined the store front, seeing everyone but his main target present. As soon as 
Takayama was downstairs (as he had been given the night off) and he and the others were away 
from the stairs and in a spot he could easily corner them, he’d be making his 
move.</p><p>And tonight, at least one of those starched shirted assholes who turned him into 
this would suffer.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Speaking of starched shirts, Reiji had ditched 
the suit coat that usually covered his as he headed downstairs to take advantage of Marry’s 
bar.</p><p>Toijira had given him the night off, and the ladies had been picked up by 
Dreizhen soldiers to give their report on their non progress on the Ouka situation. However, 
since that didn’t require him and he’d been working his ass off all week with Yuusuke and 
Cho, all three of them were now in Marry’s bar, taking the edge off their fatigue by 
knocking back some very cordial waters and generally doing the exact opposite of anything 
productive.</p><p>Marry and Rihoko were behind the bar, where Rihoko was washing glasses and 
Marry was bartender, and as Reiji took the seat in between Yuusuke and Cho (who by this 
point were nursing their drinks and enjoying the quiet immensely, he asked for and was given 
his, and as he looked around at everyone present, a peaceful feeling came over him as he saw 
the people who were now his friends and (in one case especially) family, and feeling at 
home.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>And, at that moment, it all went to hell.</p><p>First, 
Takayama and the others were in bad spot to just up and run if need be. Two, Ouka had just 
decided to step away from her hiding spot and take an inconspicuous walk so she didn’t look 
suspicious. And finally, the ExCon didn’t notice her around, but his intended victims were 
as good as alone.</p><p>Looking around one last time to make sure no one noticed him, the 
ExCon transformed and charged, deciding the hell with the door and went instead for the 
shock value he needed to trap his victims.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Reiji had just finished 
his drink and had handed the glass to Rihoko for cleaning, and as was about to head for the 
rest room to dispose of some of his newly acquired liquid weight, he saw a massive dark 
shape head full steam for the window, and his brain went into hyper drive as he yelled for 
Marry and Rihoko to get down as he yanked Yuusuke and Cho out of their seats, surprising the 
hell out of the two men but inadvertently saving them from the shards of glass that flew 
their way from the shattered windows.</p><p>As everyone hit the deck, the ExCon worked fast, 
and as Reiji looked up from where he dropped, he heard a massive crashing sound as what 
looked like an ExCon smashed the stairwell, and as he and the others started to rise to 
their feet, the massive shape suddenly barred them from trying to leave, and the monster 
looked directly at him with undisguised disgust,</p><p>“FOUND YOU, YOU EX-DOUJI 
BASTARD!”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>At Dreizhen…………</p><p>Masane and the others dutifully had 
reported they had come up dry on the “find Ouka” front, which didn’t surprise Toijira in the 
least. In fact, once that non surprising news was out of the way, he asked them what they 
thought of the Mahoken Battle armor the troops had been practicing with.</p><p>“Well, it’s 
nowhere near as good as the real deal, but it looks like it’d be an efficient augment to our 
mission of hunting the ExCons down.” was Maria’s opinion.</p><p>“Thanks, Sergeant.”, and he 
then turned to Masane, “Major, up until this point, you and the other Witch Blades have been 
the front line for our anti-ExCon force, but since we now are able to mass produce Mahoken 
battle armor, I was planning to have my troops actively support your missions from now on. 
Hopefully, this should provide your team with more direct support than the passive mission 
control we’ve mostly served up to this point. Anything about that you feel is still 
insufficient?”</p><p>Before she could reply, Toijira got a call, and the Witch Blades 
watched his eyes bulge in worry as he said, “Understood.”, and then hastily hung 
up.</p><p>“Something wrong, sir?” asked Yagi.</p><p>“An ExCon signal just appeared near 
Marry’s.”</p><p>The whole room suddenly got animated, and Toijira quickly added,</p><p>“I 
don’t know if it’s Ouka or not, but I want all of you to deploy immediately!”</p><p>He 
didn’t have to tell them twice.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, back at 
Marry’s……………</p><p>Any thought of escape were dashed from Reiji’s mind as he realized they 
were trapped. The ExCon was a broad shouldered, four armed, extremely humanoid looking 
ED-209 rip off with a clawed hand with railroad spikes seeming to make up the claws, and the 
other hand bore a narrow nozzle flamethrower, which the ExCon had fired in front of them 
briefly to emphasize that running away was a bad idea, further reinforced by the lower set 
of arms extending like an Octopus to ring them in the bar area. As Reiji looked into the 
hockey mask like face of the ExCon, it spoke in a metallic yet highly pissed off 
tone,</p><p>“YOU’RE THE FORMER SPECIAL DIVISON DIRECTOR REIJI TAKAYAMA, AREN’T 
YOU?”</p><p>Reiji knew immediately this had been planned, and everyone else’s life was 
forfeit if he decided to lie.</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>“GOOD. BEFORE I KILL ALL OF YOU, I WANTED 
TO LET YOU KNOW WHY I WANT TO SEE EVERY MEMBER OF DOUJI DEAD!”</p><p>Before Reiji could say 
anything else, the monster continued to hold the rest of them up as it told them about it 
being a former Douji Group employee who was killed and screwed over, and as he kept talking, 
he noticed Marry had surreptitiously put herself in front of Rihoko like a shield from her 
position behind the bar area, and Yuusuke and Cho had flanked her position, serving as an 
additional screen, apparently feeling they unlike Rihoko were by comparison expendable. 
Also, as the ExCon finished his sob story, Takayama finally remembered a board meeting he 
had been at where they discussed how an employee had been dealt with for corruption in vague 
but deadly sounding terms.</p><p>“So, you were planning on double dealing Douji, they found 
out, set you up to be killed, and turned you into an ExCon, which you’re furious about, 
right?”</p><p>“CORRECT!”</p><p>“So why do you want us, specifically me, 
dead?”</p><p>“BECAUSE THE REST OF THE SLIMY BASTARDS WHO TURNED ME INTO A MONSTER FLED, 
LEAVING YOU AS ONE OF THE FEW I CAN MAKE PAY FOR ME BEING TURNED INTO THIS!”</p><p>“I wasn’t 
responsible, and these people are innocent!”</p><p>“IT DOESN’T MATTER. SOMEONE NEEDS TO PAY 
FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO ME, AND YOU WERE PART OF THOSE FUCKERS WHO DID THIS TO ME, SO I’LL 
HAPPILY TAKE MY RAGE OUT ON YOU!!!”</p><p>Reiji realized the ExCon was dead serious, and he 
couldn’t deny that if anyone here needed to die, it was probably him. Hell, aside from 
supporting the good guys in a Lawful Good bureaucratic role, he hadn’t really done much to 
atone for the bastardry he committed in Douji’s service, and considering that the lives of 
his and Masane’s friends and his daughter was at stake, he decided to do something 
noble.</p><p>“You want someone dead for what happened to you? Fine, kill me if you have to, 
but leave these people out of it.”</p><p>“AND WHY SHOULD I? WHAT WORTH WOULD THEIR LIVES 
HAVE TO A MAN WHO AIDED AND ABETTED MURDERERS AND LIARS? WHY SHOULDN’T I KILL THEM? I CAN’T 
BE HAPPY EVER AGAIN, SO WHO GIVES A DAMN WHETHER I CAUSE ANYONE ELSE PAIN?!”</p><p>At those 
words, Reiji felt massive contempt for the ExCon. His own foolishness had been as self 
inflicted as the monster in front of him, and they both paid for their working for evil in 
horrifying ways, but this bastard wanted innocent people to die just it could feel better 
about its own misery, and Reiji had to resist the urge to spit as he realized that despite 
all the crap he had yet to atone for he was better than the monster across from him, and 
besides, if he kept talking long enough Masane and the others would have enough time to get 
here.</p><p>“Because the only one among us who deserves what you want is me! I was forgiven 
for my sins, but I sure as hell don’t feel I deserved it, so if you want to kill me, fine, 
I’m yours, as long as you don’t hurt anyone else!”</p><p>As the ExCon cruelly demanded why 
he shouldn’t just kill them all for the hell of it, Rihoko dashed all their efforts at 
shielding her by running around the bar area and jumped in front of her father, 
yelling,</p><p>“LEAVE MY DADDY ALONE!”</p><p>Reiji felt a lance tip bury in his heart at 
those words, and before the ExCon could fire back another homicidal declaration, he decided 
to do what Masane did and do something even more utterly noble and selfless. He’d probably 
die for it, but it was time to live up to his promise to be Rihoko’s Shield of Aegis. That 
said, he stepped in front of everyone, putting himself in striking distance of the ExCon, 
and told it defiantly,</p><p>“Leave my friends and my daughter out of this! You want me 
dead, you can have me dead. I’ve committed enough sins to deserve it many times over, so 
leave the others out of this! I let my conscience go to sleep one too many times before now, 
and I’m offering myself up to you right now as a sacrifice so you’ll let the innocent go in 
peace. And besides, you’re right, I do have blood on my hands and stains on my soul, so if 
you kill me, it’ll be what I deserve.</p><p>He paused, this time actually spitting at the 
ExCon’s feet, and finished,</p><p>“But know this: Even you have a chance for redemption, 
even now, and if you want, I can help you acquire it.”</p><p>The ExCon snorted in 
disbelieving amusement, and Reiji shook his head in disgust as Yuusuke, Cho, and Marry 
stepped in front of Rihoko, determined she would’ve not suffer at this bastard’s hands 
(which Reiji was silently blessing them for), and continued,</p><p>“And even if you don’t 
want to be redeemed, remember this as well. We’re both scum who’ve committed crimes that 
made us lose what we hold dear, and you can kill me if it makes you feel better, but my 
death means I’ll have atoned for being no better than you, and I’ll have died doing 
something for the innocents you want to main and kill, so if you really want me dead, 
then-“, and Reiji let his body go slack and his arms hang to his sides as he hung his head 
in defeat and said,</p><p>“Go ahead, kill me, but let them go in exchange.”</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>Meanwhile the Witch Blades were closing in from one direction, having just been 
informed by Toijira via Witch Blade filtered digital uplink the ExCon in question wasn’t 
Ouka and had the others hostage, which merely stoked their resolve to get there faster 
before any of their friends suffered or died, and both of Rihoko’s mothers were sharing the 
unspoken thought of,</p><p><i>“Please, don’t let Rihoko be hurt!”</i></p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>Reiji Takayama’s palms were sweaty, his throat dry, and his lungs feeling robbed 
of air. The monster he had just tried to talk out of wholesale slaughter was appearing to 
ruminate over his offer of self sacrifice, and in the few brief seconds of eerie silence 
that entailed, he was hoping and praying Masane got here in time. After all, he would be 
Rihoko’s shield without hesitation, but his corpse wouldn’t exactly stay 
that-</p><p>“TEMPTING OFFER, TAKAYAMA, BUT YOU AND THE OTHERS DIE ANYWAY!”</p><p>Reiji 
immediately rushed forward, determined to be the first one this psychotic ExCon killed 
first, hopefully buying them a little more time not to die, but halfway before the monster 
could rear back to claw him to death, an explosion hit it’s back, and Reiji heard a voice 
yell,</p><p>“GET DOWN!!!!!!”</p><p>He complied and the others complied, just as a dark shape 
swooped in through the broken storefront of Marry’s, body checking the ExCon, flinging it 
away from Reiji and the others with such force the lower arms it had extended into the walls 
Doctor Octopus-style had been torn out by the sheer inertia. As they got a good look at 
their savior (another ExCon), it said, in the adults’ general direction,</p><p>“I am Ouka 
Nagisa. Leave this monster to me, and protect the child.”</p><p>The ExCon started to rise, 
but Ouka wasn’t going to allow that, and her gun arm came back up, pumping shotgun rounds 
into it, robbing it of its balance, causing it to fall again. Deciding to get the bastard 
into a more suitable arena, Ouka picked up its momentarily limp form by the shoulder, and 
used all of her strength to chuck its metallic body into the street, where it landed with a 
sprawling bang.</p><p>As Ouka headed out to continue jacking the ExCon up, Reiji heard 
Rihoko say, with an amazing amount of calm,</p><p>“I know Mom’s going to get here soon, but 
I think we can trust Ouka.”</p><p>From where he lay on the ground, Yuusuke was 
thinking,</p><p><i>“Well, she did just save our butts and told us to protect Rihoko. I 
agree.”</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, as Masane and the others touched down at the 
end of the block, hauling ass for Marry’s, Masane heard Angelus’ voice in her 
mind.</p><p><i>“The one called Ouka Nagisa is fighting for your cause, Masane, and all that 
I ask is that you do your best to make sure she does not leave this place, as I have words 
for her. Until then, see to your friends and family, and leave the ExCon to 
me.”</i></p><p><i>“Understood!”</i></p><p>As the Witch Blades approached Marry’s, Masane 
mentally relayed this to the others, and they immediately fanned out to cover all the exits 
from the immediate area, while Masane headed for the destroyed storefront that had been 
Marry’s.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Ouka had had a lot of time to think about Dante’s words 
about how death wasn’t the answer, and as she kept smashing the ExCon against the pavement 
for the gall of attacking innocent people, she understood that she did indeed have 
value.</p><p>It wasn’t because she failed to save lives that she was defined by. Now that 
she was thinking more clearly, lots of people make good efforts to work for the safety of 
others, and sometimes they fail. However, had she not made the effort in the first place, 
she’d had been a worthless waste of carbon like the son of a bitch she was currently 
smashing her metal fists into. As she continued to leave massive dents in the ExCon’s armor, 
all she could see was the lives she just saved, and the good feeling it gave her.</p><p>She 
wanted to keep feeling that feeling, even if only for a short while.</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>As Masane ran inside, she noticed everyone had huddled behind the bar area, and 
as they all saw her, relief broke out on their faces, especially Reiji’s, who told her, 
pointing outside,</p><p>“Ouka told us to protect Rihoko, and she’d deal with the 
ExCon.”</p><p>Masane looked down, seeing Rihoko huddled next to Reiji’s leg, and he shocked 
her by saying,</p><p>“And I finally admitted the truth to my daughter.”</p><p>Rihoko merely 
smiled, despite the situation, and so did Masane, who was immediately reminded of the 
situation,</p><p>“Angelus told us to seal this area off so Ouka doesn’t leave. She said she 
needed to talk to her, and either you or Yuusuke should call Toijira and let him know the 
situation is being contained.”</p><p>Yuusuke had already gotten his phone out as she said 
it, and as he started punching numbers, another explosion could be heard from where Ouka was 
beating the crap out of the ExCon.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The ExCon had barely remembered 
he had powers, and just as Ouka was about to punch through his armor, he got his flame gun 
arm up and fired an energy blast of concussive force in Ouka’s face, allowing him enough 
time to get up as she flew back. His plans to flee, though, looked boned as he saw that 
either end of the street and the rooftops were being watched by Witch Blades who were 
currently waiting for him to move. Deciding he had to take a chance, he decided to fire off 
an energy blast at one end of the street, using that as a feint to break through the other 
side and escape.</p><p>His arm, however, froze halfway up, and the ExCon felt horrific agony 
course through its entire body, and it couldn’t even scream as complete paralysis suddenly 
seized up every single one of its extremities. As it fell backwards, its balance gone, it 
hit the ground with a dull thud, completely unable to scream, and that’s when it saw from 
its prone position a bright light appear in front of it.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>“Uh 
oh!”</i></p><p><i>“What?”</i></p><p><i>“That’s Mom, Masane, and to be blunt, she’s REALLY 
pissed off right now!”</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>As the ExCon struggled to look up, all 
it saw was a woman who looked like an extremely pissed off archangel with white hot flaming 
wings and Witch Blade-esque armor so bright you could read a newspaper three blocks away 
from the glow, and just as the former Douji employee now monster now knew fear, she spoke, 
in the voice of judgment,</p><p>“I’ve killed nobler demons than you.”</p><p>The night air’s 
temperature seemed to drop by several degrees, and as Ouka righted herself from where she 
had been blown backwards, she noticed the other Witch Blades surrounding the area and 
Angelus talking down her foe, and from a combination of curiosity and pragmatism, decided to 
watch on. A second after she made that decision, she also heard Angelus’ voice in her head, 
commanding her to watch, lest she be struck motionless as well, which merely gave Ouka more 
reason to comply.</p><p>Meanwhile, back with the ExCon, Angelus was tearing the bastard a 
verbal asshole,</p><p>“You had a chance to do what was just in life, and you squandered it. 
Even in your cursed unlife, you had a chance at redemption, and you wasted it on petty 
revenge and blood lust. You might have been trapped as a monster, but unlike another man 
named Muraki and the young woman you just fought, you did not choose to do good, instead 
continuing to forment the evil that brought the wrath of myself and the father of the Witch 
Blade upon your people, and you even tried to murder innocents simply for the joy of 
watching their deaths. For you, I have no pity.”</p><p>She paused, then spat on the ExCon, 
nailing it in the right eye, and ignoring the acidic effect it was now having on the ExCon’s 
face, continued,</p><p>“The young woman you just fought had even more sins on her soul than 
you, having been the basis for the many of Tatsuoki Furumizu’s later crimes and those of 
your fellow sinners from Douji, but despite her curse, she fought for the life of innocents 
and resisted to the urge to maim and kill. She was of Good, and did not do nothing, thus she 
is worthy of redemption, but you committed great evil, and thus you shall pay for your 
iniquity.”</p><p>Angelus paused again, a spear of pure light forming in her hands. As she 
prepared to strike, Masane heard a voice in her head,</p><p><i>“Cover your child’s eyes, 
Masane. I do not wish her to witness this.”</i></p><p>Masane complied, and Angelus, with one 
quick thrust, buried the spear tip into the ExCon’s good eye socket, the monster unable to 
scream as a result of her iron control over its body. As the spear disappeared in a flash of 
light, so did the ExCon with it.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>From where Ouka was standing she 
had to admit she was feeling rather shocked.</p><p>One of the creators of the Witch Blade 
had just shown up, brutally executed an ExCon in front of her, and informed all present she 
was considered worthy of still living. Ouka was finally starting to believe that, and the 
fact that someone who should’ve been the most pissed of all at her was instead forgiving her 
was causing her denial filter to fail miserably.</p><p>It was completely shattered by the 
time Angelus walked over to her, looked her dead in the eyes, and asked,</p><p>“So, Ouka 
Nagisa, do you still feel worthy of death?”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Masane and the others 
from Marry’s decided to walk on out to where Angelus was, and by some unspoken consent all 
of them stopped as soon as they were in earshot, watching in mute curiosity as what looked 
like an angel of light and a now detransformed Ouka were speaking.</p><p>“………I’m not sure 
anymore…………” she muttered, face downcast.</p><p>Angelus, to everyone’s surprise, had a 
rueful look on her face as she replied, “To be honest, Ouka, you aren’t the only 
one.”</p><p>As she said this, a Witch Blade in white armor ran from her current position for 
Ouka, throwing her arms around her in a hug as she yelled,</p><p>“Sister!!!!!!!”</p><p>It 
was Yuriko, who was currently sobbing into Ouka’s shoulder, partially because she was upset 
she had to fight the older girl at one point, and partially because she didn’t want her to 
leave. Ouka returned the embrace in a stunned daze, an odd feeling of peace coming over her 
as her ExCon nature suddenly seemed to go inert, which she suspected was Angelus’ doing. As 
she looked up at Angelus, the smile on her face seemed to confirm that, and Masane stepped 
forward and said, pointing at Yuriko,</p><p>“I don’t know about you, Ouka, but that’s a 
pretty good reason not to kill yourself.”</p><p>Before Ouka could respond to that, Yuusuke 
stepped forward as well, “You saved our lives and did the right thing. You don’t deserve to 
die for that.</p><p>Cho stepped forward, his usual perverted air muted (mostly out of 
deference to Angelus, who he figured he should tread lightly around) but present as he said, 
“And besides, it’d be a shame for the world to be deprived of a lovely young lady like 
yourself.”</p><p>Marry stepped up as well, “I don’t know much about your situation, but a 
lot of people love you, and you shouldn’t make them cry, if you ask me.”</p><p>Reiji added 
in his two cents as well, “I did some horrible things and did a lot less than you did to 
make up for it, but I was forgiven. You deserve redemption no less than I did, and perhaps 
even more.”</p><p>After a second or two of hearing this, Ouka had to ask,</p><p>“All of you 
barely know me, so why do you-“</p><p>“Because they want to forgive you, regardless of your 
past deeds” answered Angelus, “and they realize that by doing well, it would be a sad waste 
of your efforts to defend others to end yourself. You cared for the lives of those you 
barely knew about, yet you were their protector, and they are honoring the shield that 
protected them with their gratitude.”</p><p>Yuriko had by this point peeled herself off 
Ouka’s shoulders, and that’s when the rest of the Witch Blades swooped in, on Angelus’ 
orders, and as they surrounded Ouka, they added their own words of encouragement, and 
followed Yuriko’s lead on the hugging scene, which Angelus watched with pleased 
bemusement.</p><p>As Ouka felt her face resemble a black cherry from all the excess “awwww 
!!!!!!” engendered from everyone’s good will, a few more bolts of light shot up around 
Angelus, and Darkness and Kenichi stepped out, the latter looking like a mini-Darkness. The 
mortals present, already a little awed by Angelus, were even more stunned by Darkness and 
his protégé, but since their weirdness censors were almost totally shattered by this point, 
this wound up being accepted as an unusually uninteresting sight, which was just as well, as 
they weren’t the parties the recent arrivals would be addressing.</p><p>Kenichi, after 
shooting Aoi a look that said “we need to talk later”, turned his attention to Ouka and told 
her,</p><p>“I know most everyone else here was redeemed in some way, and I used to be an 
ExCon like you, but Lord Darkness forgave me and helped me escape my demons, and you have 
just as much chance as I did at being freed yourself.”, and Ouka found herself looking at 
his outstretched hand as he said, a beaming smile on his face,</p><p>“So, Whaddya 
say?”</p><p>Ouka looked around, and saw nothing but forgiveness etched into the faces of 
everyone present, and she made her decision.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Asagi watched on as 
Ouka knelt before Angelus, and just loud enough for everyone to hear, said,</p><p>“I am 
yours, milady. Do with me as you will.”</p><p>Angelus and Darkness shared a brief sidelong 
glance, and then she looked down at Ouka.</p><p>“Rise.”</p><p>As she did, Angelus grabbed 
her arm, and what looked like bolt of energy shot through Ouka’s body, except she didn’t 
look like she was in any pain. As they subsided, a slightly cracked looked Clone Blade 
appeared on her wrist, except in was metallic looking and covered in an inky blackness. 
Everyone, Ouka included, looked at it in horror, and Angelus told her,</p><p>“The darkness 
and corruption bound to you is now bound up in that perverse copy of our child. If you wish 
to be free of it, Ouka, I demand but one thing.”</p><p>“Anything.”</p><p>“You shall serve as 
my avatar, Ouka. As young Kenichi”, indicating Darkness’ protégé, “serves Darkness, you 
shall serve me.”</p><p>Ouka merely closed her eyes and nodded.</p><p>Angelus suddenly looked 
stern, and motioned firmly for everyone to stand back. All present backed off about ten 
paces, and then Angelus suddenly grabbed Ouka and pulled her into an embrace. As she did, 
everyone was blinded as a wall of holy power enshrouded the two of them, forcing all present 
to shield their eyes. It soon started dying down, and as it receded, they all looked at the 
two figures that remained after the light passed.</p><p>One was Angelus, and the other, now 
having stepped away from her, was Ouka, except now she looked like an angel, with wings as 
white as snow and armor gleaming like polished ivory, looking very much like her new master. 
As everyone looked on in awe, Ouka looked herself over, and realized something felt very 
different. The dark urges she had had to hold at bay were gone, and instead she felt like 
the human being she had been long ago-</p><p>-and a few seconds after this, Ouka threw 
herself around Angelus’ shoulders, crying tears of joy at the fact was pure, she had another 
chance to be human, but most of all:</p><p>She had been redeemed, and her life could begin 
anew, not as a dirge, but an aria of renewal rejoicing in the power of redemption.</p>
