<h1>Priori Addendum (part 4 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../witchblade/index.html">Witchblade</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rpgingmaster.html">RPGing Master</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../witchblade/prioriadden-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><p>(Japanese safe house of the Thirteen, Location undisclosed)</p><p>There were Sixteen in 
all: The Angelus, The Darkness, The Spear of Destiny, The Bloodsword, The Rapture, The Wheel 
of Shadows, The Stones of Terra/Aqueous/Ember/Aero, The Sword of Life, The Key to the Gulf, 
The Scythe of Death, The Compass of Destiny, The Edge of Eternum, and The Witch Blade. These 
artifacts were fragments of the Creator’s power, given power to choose worthy bearers to 
stay the flow of evil and maintain the Holy Balance. These artifacts had tipped the scales 
in many wars, changed the fate of civilizations, and continued the stalemate between Good 
and Evil. And their bearers, knowing the sheer gravity of the power they wielded, had 
decided to do their best to keep these blessed tools out of the auguries of evil.</p><p>As 
said before, only the worthy could use the holy relics, but the forces of evil could summon 
demons, commit foul sorceries, and could harness the will of evil to pervert the pure, and 
the Thirteen feared what might happen if the Divine artifacts were to be copied, and distaff 
bastard childer made to challenge the Creator’s will, thus throughout history, they affected 
many lives and many civilizations, sometimes committing acts so gray as to be deemed black 
to stopgap Evil from perverting the Divine.</p><p>Their intervention was such that Joan of 
Arc, one of the bearers of the Witch Blade, had been declared a heretic and sentenced to a 
farce of a trial by their agents, who were in all actuality using the trial as a smokescreen 
to officially edit out of any official records of “La Pucelle’s” Holy Blade, substituting a 
legend of a blessed sword whose location was given her by the Archangel Michael, as a cover 
so the real Witch Blade would not pass into evil hands. It was only at the end of the trial 
did The Maid learn of their deeds, and accepted her reputation’s death at the stake, once 
she learned that in her death, the magic gauntlet she once wielded would be kept safely away 
from the English warlords who still sought to subjugate her people. It should also be said 
that once this was established, they reedited the court records once more, selectively 
retconning the portions of the truth to clear her name, as they were not without guilt for 
its necessary but grisly deed, but as for regret they felt none. To keep it and the other 
artifacts out of evil’s hands was a task that demanded the line must be crossed to even 
preserve the line’s existence, and their members were more stalwart than the Knights Templar 
in this goal.</p><p>Sadly, their track record was far from perfect. Not too long ago before 
the present, the holder of The Darkness, Jackie Estacado, was overcome by his power and 
forced himself on the Witch Blade bearer Sara Pezzini, consummating a child with an act of 
evil that went against the very nature of the Witch Blade, though if blame must be assigned, 
the bearer of the Darkness was not sufficient to resist the overcomance of Chaos. 
Thankfully, the incident was denied disaster by a temporary splitting of the Blade, 
shielding its bearer and its successor from the horrific if unintentional aftereffects of 
the violation of the Divine contract between Blade and bearer to never be party to an act of 
evil. They had dropped the ball on this incident, and more like it, truth be told, but when 
they could intervene, they did, and it was with this incident they decided to become as 
knowledgeable about all events occurring on Earth to better serve as shield against further 
incursions on the sanctity of the Divine.</p><p>That said, Migura and the other members of 
the Thirteen had convened in a rather opulent yet secluded summer home they had long ago 
established for discreet rendezvous and temporary internment of parties requiring their 
protection while in the Land of the Rising Sun, and were currently gleaning info from some 
officers of the JSDF, who owed them a metric ton of favors after the Thirteen had intervened 
to save their asses from a crazy necromancer whose racism and revival of a terrorist zombie 
army threatened to make the Home Islands more lethal to foreigners than China during the 
Boxer Rebellion.</p><p>“So, Major, what can you tell us about the JDSF’s stance on the 
situation regarding the rogue ExCons and the reappearance of not only the Witch Blade, but 
some of the former Neogenes, who seem to bear non self destructive copies of the Blade?”, 
was Migura’s opening statement after the back history of Douji and the NSWF’s involvement 
had been sufficiently covered.</p><p>Major Kouji Nagare, who served in the S-2 
(Intelligence) wing of the Japanese Self Defense Force was here on behalf of the JDSF, and 
didn’t even look perturbed at the question as he blandly answered,</p><p>“Well, the JDSF has 
never really been able to effectively investigate the incidents leading up to the 
reappearance of the Witch Blade, mostly because Douji and the NSWF kept throwing obscene 
amounts of money at the politicians in the Diet, obstructing us from even entering the city 
of Tokyo to investigate. Since most of those corrupt bastards are now without their 
sponsors, that has been rescinded, and the few decent people in the Japanese government have 
relented to allowing the JSDF to be the public face of the cleanup operations in Tokyo, 
because as you well know, not only do we owe all of you a great debt, the bribing assholes 
who made any investigation we might have launched difficult are gone, and the JDSF will be 
working on the Thirteen’s behalf to clean up what Douji and Furumizu started.”</p><p>Angela, 
bearer of the Spear of Destiny (and resident tsundere of the Thirteen) snapped back, “That’s 
good to hear Major, but why the hell was the Witch Blade even allowed to fall into the hands 
of these bastards in the first place?</p><p>Migura intervened, “Calm yourself, Angela. After 
the blade passed from Yuri Miyazono, it seemed to have vanished from the Earth, despite our 
best efforts to track it, but then again, we are only human. At any rate, it fell into the 
hands of two mega corporations for a time, both of which were apparently willing to go to a 
lot of effort to shield their agendas from the public, and who managed to do the very thing 
we oppose without us even knowing it. Given that, it is fair to say that we could not know 
about what we were unaware.”</p><p>Major Nagare spoke up again, “And besides, from the 
inception of their retainer of the Blade, we had no idea what they were doing because they 
passed cash out like candy and had some clever cover stories. The Great Quake was even 
plausibly explained away by a massive natural gas explosion and a dormant fault line 
colliding at the worst time, and even we were hoodwinked for quite some time, especially 
given that topographical studies of the area revealed remnants of both. We also had no idea 
about the actual construction materials of the ExCons because when the JDSF turned down 
Douji’s product due to their insufficient information as to their construction, Douji 
effectively froze any further information we would have gotten from their already tight 
lips. And as I said, we were strangled by crooked politicians and reams of 
bullshit.”</p><p>Angela merely shot the man a look of annoyed contempt, and at that point 
Hiroki Segawa, who was serving as the moderating influence, raised his hand. Migura gave him 
the floor, and he said, “I should also mention that on top of the preexisting lies, bribery, 
and outright extortion by Douji, the NSWF under Furumizu put on an elaborate show for the 
Japanese government, essentially paying for much of the restoration of Tokyo out of his own 
pocket to spare the politicians already corrupted by Douji from having to surrender the 
public’s money to do anything. He also more of less bought out all of the Child Services in 
Tokyo and replaced their members with cronies of his choosing, so while Douji was hiding the 
truth about the ExCons and I Weapons, he was hiding the existence of the Neogenes, and 
apparently they were pretty successful in keeping the truth from getting out at the zenith 
of their powers.”</p><p>No one contested these words, and Migura thought that, in fairness, 
that that didn’t explain in full why they dropped the ball so badly, but the sad truth of 
the matter was they had overextended themselves at the time. Having assumed the Witch Blade 
would eventually turn up, they had monitored a bunch of other fires, as they were devoted to 
keeping the balance between good and evil, and that covered incidents outside of the Divine 
Artifacts as well.</p><p>In fact, in recent history their agents had been working overtime 
through their agents in the Church to prevent the reincarnation of a power demon by a fallen 
ex-missionary of the Church, intervened in a war over the Holy Grail, lent technical support 
to forces fighting vampire incursions in Germany and Japan, and had stopped some fool with a 
god complex from ripping open a hole in the void between dimensions and potentially using it 
a blackmail tool to get the nations of the world to capitulate to his demands. Given all the 
insanity they had been preoccupied with, it wasn’t much of a surprise that complacency, lack 
of hindsight, corrupt bastards, and lots of shit to do had allowed some assholes to pervert 
one of the Divine Artifacts and damn near blow up a city twice, and continue doing so for 
six plus years.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(Set almost a week after the events of Episode 
3)</p><p>As Reiji Takayama sat at his villa, recently repaired, he was reading the latest 
newspaper, which, combined with what had happened ever since Masane had gone public, merely 
reaffirmed what he already knew.</p><p>Chief Akira Nakata had given a press conference after 
the ExCon attack, which had the effect of making the police look good as well as the Witch 
Blades as he informed Tokyo he had deputized them to legally serve as part of the Tokyo 
Police’s anti-ExCon task force. Considering that Masane and her crew had obscenely high 
popularity ratings after having unmasked the conspiracies of some power and money obsessed 
maniacs, and had effectively punched out Tokyo’s equivalent of Cthulhu, it was fair to say 
that getting out of the area had been hairy after the ExCon was destroyed. Somehow, they 
managed without leading the press to Marry’s front door, and the girls were lying low, 
waiting for some of the excitement to bleed off. In the interim, several events of extreme 
importance were forcing him to make a decision he had asked to sleep on.</p><p>Hiroki Segawa 
had quietly convinced the holders of the plurality of the Douji stock to turn over their 
stock to him, as a cover for themselves. The week before the Battle of Tokyo, most of the 
Board of Directors had seen which way the wind was blowing, and had already made plans to 
flee, and Segawa, having cottoned to this during his sub-rosa spying, quietly approached 
these individuals and convinced them to make him the major shareholder as they fled, which 
would distract the law from them to investigate this anomaly, which would buy them 
additional time to escape. He told them he had a good supposition why they were trying to 
run, but pointed out (falsely) he had no smoking gun proof, and as a courtesy to the fact 
Douji had given him such an elevated position, he was going to emulate his boss and take a 
bullet for them too. Impressed and too overjoyed to have a scapegoat, they turned their 
brains off and went along with this, not realizing they were stooges in a massive gambit pre 
setup by the Thirteen and JSDF. After they fled, ownership passed over to him, and before 
this information went public, he already turned ownership over to the JSDF (who by law had 
the ability to subsume military industries in the event of criminal allegations against said 
company had been levied), and considering they had overtly been trying to build a case of 
Douji selling weapons to unfriendly nations while covertly getting the proof, this just 
worked out great, as they could save Hiroki’s ass by declaring him as their mole (he was) 
who was giving them information on Douji’s dirty deeds (he was and did), and they could do 
so while adhering to the letter of the law and scoring a major coup for themselves, their 
allies (the Thirteen), and by extension keep the Witch Blades and Takayama available to help 
them, with their roles now legitimized and given official sanction. All of this had 
culminated in an article stating that the JSDF had assumed control of Douji and were 
planning to use it as military frontline base to proactively handle the ExCon problem, that 
is, after the Tokyo police had investigated the place.</p><p>He also had told Masane about 
what Segawa had told him, and he had confessed he had his doubts, His cell phone began 
ringing. “This is Reiji Takayama speaking.”</p><p>“I assume you’re still thinking about the 
offer I had Segawa propose, correct?”</p><p>Reiji sat bolt upright, realizing the man on the 
other idea was probably Segawa’s boss, “Yes, sir, I have.”</p><p>“Have you made your 
decision?”</p><p>“Tentatively, yes, but I’d like to know what exactly you plan to do to 
assist the police and the Witch Blades in eliminating the ExCons before I commit 
myself.”</p><p>“Perfectly understandable, Takayama-san. My colleagues and I were wondering 
if you could join us for a business meeting at my hotel suite.”</p><p>He asked where it was, 
and the information was obliged him.</p><p>“I’m assuming you’d like this meeting now, 
sir?”</p><p>“Why not? Time, as the saying goes, is of the essence, correct?”</p><p>“I’ll be 
coming over, but I’ll be bringing Masane Amaha with me, is that alright?”</p><p>“By all 
means. By the way, you can call me Migura.”</p><p>“Arigatou, Migura-san. Give me an hour or 
so, will you?”</p><p>“I’ll be waiting.”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(An hour later)</p><p>He 
had picked up Masane from Marry’s, informing her that he had been invited into a meeting 
with Segawa’s bosses, and he wanted her to attend it with him, as its contents were relevant 
to her, and she agreed to go with him, though he was fairly sure this meeting would not 
entail any danger on either of their parts.</p><p>As he and Masane arrived at the hotel 
complex, he had no idea that the Thirteen had had a currently invisible Daemon scout ahead 
for him and relay that info for the others. At any rate, a valet appeared soon after he 
arrived and told him he had been expected.</p><p>As he and Masane were led and then ushered 
into Migura’s hotel suite. As he entered, he saw a conference table with a few people of 
varying nationalities, some of them indeterminate, like the Caucasian looking gentleman at 
the head of the table with the heavy lines around his eyes who seemed to be the leader, as 
well as an additional middle aged Japanese gentleman at Migura’s right hand who was in 
plainclothes but appeared to be of military background. As he approached the table, Migura 
pointed to two empty chairs at the other end of the table, which Takayama and Masane took. 
As they did, the Thirteen introduced themselves, and Migura introduced the man beside him, 
“This is Colonel Daisuke Toijira, of the Japanese Self Defense Forces, and he is commander 
of the nearby Niitaka base, and a longtime supporter of our activities, not to mention an 
old friend of mine.</p><p>Introductions were exchanged, and Migura took the floor again, “We 
have long since lent our assistance and that of our subordinates to the Japanese government, 
particularly their government ever since the Second World War and we are both cooperating on 
a joint venture to form a team to eliminate the remaining ExCons. We understand that you and 
your comrades”, indicating Masane, “have a similar mission granted you by Angelus and 
Darkness, and we do not wish to prejudice that. Instead, since we share the same goal, we 
were wondering if your forces would join hands with our own so we may both reach the goal of 
protecting humanity as we both intend.”</p><p>Colonel Toijira took the floor from here, 
“Hiroki Segawa has been under the employ of the Thirteen, who have been helping us build a 
case against Douji, though we we’re persuaded not to interfere with their mission because 
they wanted to not only effect a total disgrace of Douji, but they wanted their agent to be 
in a position to recover all the evidence we’d need to unequivocally give the JSDF the 
impetus to seize the Douji complex and hand up all the evidence we’d ever need to make our 
case solid as a rock. We were going to take over Douji, turn it into a military contracting 
facility for the JSDF, and we wanted not only the Witch Blades to assist us in eliminating 
them, but we wanted to grant you” indicating Takayama “titular control of this organization, 
especially considering that it will prove to the public that not only were you trying to 
eliminate those monsters, but now your activities will have the legal sanction of the 
Japanese military, and this will also, as a precautionary measure, serve to prove to Angelus 
and Darkness that you have fully repented of your former dealings with Douji, and that your 
activities and ours do not run afoul of their own anti-ExCon efforts.”</p><p>Takayama didn’t 
know what to say, so he simply remained silent as Lord Migura continued, “As they say, they 
are indeed dedicated to preserving the Holy Balance that you and Amaha-san fought to 
preserve, and their mission overlaps with that of my own colleagues, who hold the other 
pieces of the Divine Powers. You fought our mission when we sadly we’re negligent in our 
duties, and we’d like to offer the resources of my colleagues and that of the JSDF to 
eliminating the remaining ExCons.”</p><p>To that, Takayama couldn’t resist a look of shame, 
which Migura gently chided him for.</p><p>“Takayama-san, we do not hold you at fault for 
your former complicity. You turned away from Trespass and did the right thing. You turned 
your knowledge and skills for good instead of continuing evil, and that’s why we invited you 
here. We want you to join our team, and help eliminate the ExCons to expiate the sin of 
Trespass and possibly give your own conscience some clarity.”</p><p>“If I do join, what 
would you have me do?”</p><p>Migura added, “It seems our colleagues Darkness and Angelus 
have decided to take care of the Neogenes and the disposal of the ExCons, so we’ll be acting 
as observers and providing assistance as well, as we too wish the sins of Douji and the NSWF 
to be eliminated.”</p><p>Takayama was silent for a moment, then, “If all that is true, why 
did you give me the only copy of the Clone Blade research?”</p><p>Migura: “Good faith. That 
research is going to be vital in destroying those monsters, as the details of their 
construction should be essential to their destruction, but to prove our good intentions, we 
gave you the information first to prove our good will. Obviously, we will need to retain 
that knowledge to keep it from falling into the wrong hands, but as I said, we wished to 
prove our bona fides and our sincerity.”</p><p>At that, he informed Masane, “I also would 
like to thank you for all of your efforts on humanity’s behalf, and sincerely wish to 
express the regret we all feel for any suffering you may have borne as a result of being the 
latest bearer of the Power of Balance.”</p><p>Masane rose from her seat, looking at Migura 
critically, replying, “Thank you, but since the Witch Blade made me grow up as a person, and 
made me realize that there are things worth fighting for, I wouldn’t trade what happened to 
me for the world. I was able to reunite with the man beside me, I was able to come back to 
my daughter, was able to allow those who died of that madness another chance at life. 
Whatever pain I bore to get here is irrelevant, as I gained a lot more out of it, and though 
I’ll help you and your allies destroy the ExCons, I don’t see this power as a curse, and I 
will use it in defense of the innocent not only because it is what I’m supposed to do, but 
because I want to spare anyone else that misery you speak of.”</p><p>Everyone in the room 
was a little shocked at Masane’s stark honesty and conviction, but the first to reply was 
Migura, who told her in a somewhat chagrined tone, “I now know why you were picked as the 
latest bearer, and I’m sorry if my words were indiscretionate.”</p><p>Masane switched 
instantly from being solemn to nonchalance, waving his Migura’s apology off as if it were no 
big deal, and he and everyone else rose as the meeting was apparently drawn to a close, and 
the Colonel took an attaché case he had apparently been holding, and slid it over to Reiji. 
As he took it, Migura informed him it had some information he might find interesting. This 
doubled as a sign this brief little rendezvous was over, and Migura bade him and Masane 
goodbye, and that they would be conversing a lot longer a few days later. With that, Masane 
and Reiji took their leave.</p><p>As they left, Migura turned to the others, saying wryly, 
“I guess I can recall Daemon from his spy duties now.”</p><p>One of the women chuckled, “Why 
not. Mankind has just gained some new paladins to protect them.”</p><p>The male beside her 
chipped in, “That remains to be seen, but I’d tend to agree.”</p><p>Migura decided to 
conclude the meeting, but not before telling the assembled, “I guess Pythagoras was correct: 
The greatest event in the history of a man’s soul is his decision to do good or to do 
evil.”</p><p>On that note, the meeting ended, leaving the weight of those words hanging like 
a cloud.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(later in the same day)</p><p>Takayama had showed up at 
Marry’s and immediately told the Witch Blade nakama he had something important to share with 
them that couldn’t wait. Despite the fact Reina was currently learning to add a little 
randomness to her cooking with Rihoko, while Maria played the role of taste tester, and 
despite the fact Shiori and Aoi were currently sequestered off in Reina and Shiori’s room 
having some girl-girl (not that type) bonding over their respective girl-girl (in that way) 
relationships, Masane telling them to assemble in her room for the debriefing was enough, 
and after Asagi was woken from a catnap, they all met in Masane’s room, where Takayama 
produced the attaché case, and informed everyone of his meeting, and it’s respective 
players.</p><p>To that, Reina raised her hand,</p><p>“So, let me get this straight. You met 
with the bosses of an organization dedicated to doing what we’re doing, and they offer us 
membership in exchange for being able to help us out?”</p><p>“Yes, Ms. Sohou. That is 
correct.” replied, Reiji, voice deadpan but eyes smiling as he parodied a grammar school 
teacher, which prompted Reina to giggle uncontrollably. No one else thought it was that 
funny, but Reina, having knowing Takayama during his most prevalent “stick up the ass” 
years, found it hilarious.</p><p>At any rate, the comedy ended, and Takayama opened the 
attaché case, finding several leather clad binders. Opening one simply marked “Mission”, he 
read off the charter of the proposed anti-ExCon taskforce, which was interesting in an 
intellectual way, but couched in such banal bureaucratese that even he had to fight the urge 
to fall asleep (and he had BEEN a bureaucrat), but after the agony ended, it turned out to 
be little more than what he had been told at his meeting, albeit in a very boring manner. As 
he finished, he actually saw Asagi pantomime (or not) yawning, Shiori’s eyes were wondering 
as if she were stoned, Masane was twiddling her thumbs, Reina was actually trying to prop 
her eyelids open with her fingernails, and Aoi and Maria were leaning against each other, 
eyes half shut, looking like two dead trees supporting each other’s weight.</p><p>After 
seeing that, Reiji decided it would just be better to pass the rest of the info around, and 
thus everyone played shuffle with the binders. This went on for the next thirty minutes, as 
all parties reading the info (or merely skimmed in some cases) found it ranged from as 
boring as the mission statement to as interesting as some of the stuff in one binder labeled 
“Historical Record”.</p><p>Apparently, the Thirteen hadn’t just intervened to stop the Witch 
Blade and its affiliates from being abused. They had also been involved in stopping the 
rogue director of anti-Black Magic subsidiary from going ax crazy and using the drained 
magical essence of witches as some kind of super soldier serum. Also, they had helped some 
kid who could literally kill anything wipe out some creepy nightwalkers calling themselves 
the “Twenty Seven Dead Apostles”, courtesy some second hand help via the Church.</p><p>On a 
saner note, some of the other binders had less lurid material. One, simply titled 
“Administrative Subsidiaries” listed some sub organizations of allied to the Thirteen such 
as the Kansai Magic Association, the STN-J, the Shin’i Youkai Investigations Agency, amongst 
various other organizations that apparently handled everything from aliens to body snatching 
eldritch abominations from parallel universes. Just browsing the list gave the assembled a 
pretty good idea of how small a fish they were in a very chaotic pond. Asagi even joked that 
Earth should have a big neon sign hanging over it, saying,</p><p>“<b>ALWAYS 
DOOMED.”</b></p><p>Considering how painfully close to the truth the joke actually was, no 
one could bring themselves to laugh.</p><p>The binder detailing the histories of the Witch 
Blade, the Angelus, the Darkness, and the Divine artifacts immediately grabbed Masane’s 
attention, and as she read about some dick named Kenneth Irons who apparently was Wadou’s 
predecessor, and how he tried to screw over former bearer Sara Pezzini, she heard the Witch 
Blade tell her,</p><p>“<i>Sara was a bearer I was actually pretty close to. Maybe you’d like 
to hear about her sometime?”</i></p><p>“<i>I actually would like that.”</i> Masane thought 
back. Hell, not only was it nice that the Witch Blade gave her advice, but upon finding out 
Sara had been a NYPD cop and a single mother at one point meant that maybe the Witch Blade 
could probably tell her how Sara apparently balanced the scale of work and child. And, 
considering that the fate of humanity was at stake here, Masane was willing to welcome any 
pointers she could get.</p><p>That said, she decided to go check on her daughter, and after 
excusing herself, she headed back downstairs, where Rihoko was currently cleaning up the 
kitchen. Saying nothing, she wordlessly walked over and helped Rihoko, words suddenly 
failing as an emotional icicle impaled her chest. As they finished, she sat down at the 
table, fighting a sudden urge to weep.</p><p>“Mom?” asked Rihoko.</p><p>Masane turned her 
chair sideways away from the table to face her daughter, and the dam burst. She embraced 
Rihoko like a child would their teddy bear, and like Rihoko’s father, she too started 
sobbing. She had willingly died for her little Riko, and the fact she could be by her side 
once more had sent her into shock for awhile, and now the stunned feeling wore off, the 
emotional sandbags were at this moment blown away, and as Masane continued to cry, Rihoko 
understood why her mother was crying.</p><p>“I love you, Mom. When you promised to always be 
with me, I knew you’d keep it, so don’t cry………”, and as finished saying this, she shifted 
her shoulder up slightly so Masane could cry on it, and Masane felt a second wave of tears 
erupt as she realized the true blessing she held in her arms, and an austere smile crossed 
her face as the sobbing eventually subsided, as she remembered this was literally her second 
chance, and Riko would never need to want for love again.</p><p>Meanwhile, in her mind, the 
Witch Blade was overcome, and in a quiet recess of her mind, all he could think about was 
his own parents, how hadn’t been able to sense them for so long, and he wept to himself over 
the beautiful display of love he felt honored to be witness to, and he thought as loudly as 
he could in his parents’ direction,</p><p>“<i>Mother………Father………I missed you so 
much.”</i></p><p>That’s when he heard the voices of his father, obviously as emotional as 
he,</p><p>“<i>We know, son, and we love you.”</i></p><p>And his mother, through sobs, 
added,</p><p>“<i>We were fools to burn so strongly with anger that we shut you out of our 
lives. Please……………forgive us………</i></p><p>“<i>I forgive you, and mother………father…………I’ll 
always love you, no matter what.”</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(one day later, mid 
afternoon)</p><p>Yuriko Mazaki was known to be a quiet young lady. She had a job as a 
botanist in a flower store; she lived alone, had very few friends, and was more of a 
shrinking violet than the flower itself. She also had a secret that caused her great 
pain.</p><p>She had been one of the first of Furumizu’s Neogenes, and he had treated her 
like she was special, and had literally given her a home and family (the other sisters). For 
the longest time, she had thought this happy state of affairs would last forever. After it 
beat being an orphan whose own mother essentially abandoned her, and when Furumizu adopted 
her and promised her a loving family, she couldn’t be happier.</p><p>Most of her days in his 
care had involved her simply growing up alongside the other girls Furumizu had adopted, some 
young girls, some women, but all were, as she understood it, related to him, courtesy of 
something called “gene splicing”. She had no idea what the term meant, but as long as she 
had a family, she didn’t care. She and her sisters had even occasionally been called into 
his room some nights, where they got to sleep with him, where he would hold them and tell 
them how special they were to him. At one point, she had gotten this experience, and she had 
his hands all over her, and him telling her he wanted to know every fiber of his special 
child. She had been scared, but she trusted him, content in the knowledge someone cared for 
her.</p><p>Suddenly, this happy state of affairs came to an end. Father had come into her 
room one day and told her that she would no longer be useful as a Neogene, and informed her 
that he was cutting her loose to make her own way in the world. She was barely an adult at 
the time, no skills or possessions to her name, and when she tried to tell Father she would 
do anything to be “useful” to him and stay, she suddenly saw him angry for the first time, 
and the last thing she remembered was a needle roughly jabbed in her arm, after which she 
soon passed out.</p><p>She awoke three days later lying in a hospital bed, most of her 
memories gone, and all she could remember telling the nurses and doctors’ attending her was 
her name and that she had been abandoned by her father, whose name she couldn’t even recall. 
While recovering, she had been informed she had been sexually abused, and strange substances 
not meant for the human body were found in her bloodstream, and when asked, she found she 
couldn’t account for it. When asked if her father was responsible, she felt an immense 
nameless terror that sent her into hysterics, forcing the doctors to have to sedate her, 
more or less confirming their suspicions that she was a victim of abuse.</p><p>She had spent 
many weeks in the hospital recovering from withdrawal from the poisons in her bloodstream 
and regaining her strength, and a counselor at the hospital had managed to get her to open 
up enough that she remembered she was good at raising plants, as well as some disjointed 
memories of having a bunch of sisters that she missed dearly. She still hadn’t been able to 
remember much else, and the counselor had helped her get into a communal shelter for abused 
women, where she managed to get her current job tending to the plants in the flower shop. 
She was still painfully shy, so she worked in the back of the store, tending to the flowers, 
and the old woman who ran the place, a Ms. Kaede Nozami, knew of her history (as she was the 
grandmother of the hospital counselor), and merely watched over Yuriko, quietly hoping some 
day that she could open up.</p><p>Meanwhile, she continued to quietly work away, finding, if 
not peace, contentment in his work, hoping one day her memories might return, and she could 
know why she had been abandoned.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>(later that evening)</p><p>Maria 
was bored.</p><p>Aoi was bored.</p><p>Asagi was bored.</p><p>The floor of Marry’s was board. 
And trying to figure out what type was a pretty lousy way to alleviate boredom. That said, 
they noticed that even Rihoko, whose cheerful demeanor usually lightened up the room, was 
listlessly cleaning dishes with the fire and verve of an unconscious pothead. Masane was 
currently off at Takayama’s, ostensibly to review the briefing materials, but Asagi couldn’t 
resist commenting on how she didn’t believe they’d quit “reviewing” until tomorrow morning’s 
reveille.</p><p>That thinly veiled innuendo barely elicited a reaction, and Maria, 
remembering how she used to throw tantrums over not being able to get what she wanted, 
decided instead to act mature, so she calmly approached Reina and Shiori, who were currently 
continuing their culinary education at the hands of Marry (who had been roping them into 
helping her run her place of business), and asked politely,</p><p>“Mom, could we go take a 
walk?”</p><p>Reina immediately turned away from where she was kneading some bread dough and 
immediately said, “Sorry, I don’t think it’s a good idea.”</p><p>That said, Maria decided 
maturity could screw itself.</p><p>“But it’s BORING!”</p><p>Shiori, who had just finished 
digging through the cabinets for some yeast, popped around, looked at her, and gently 
admonished, “You heard your mother.”</p><p>Maria was about to fire back that Shiori wasn’t 
her fath- , but that comment never left her mind as the unpleasant connotations associated 
with that word came back. Thankfully, Asagi saved the day yet again,</p><p>“It’s a quiet 
night, there aren’t a lot of people out, and we just want to get some air, 
okay?”</p><p>Reina was about to say that Masane wasn’t around to okay the decision, but 
realized that the request was basically harmless, the girls could take care of themselves, 
and as long as they didn’t go too far, it should be okay.</p><p>“Fine. Be back in an 
hour.”</p><p>With that, Maria, Aoi, and Asagi turned to leave. As they did, Marry, who had 
been directing Reina and Shiori in how to make pizza, asked, “You girls really sure they’ll 
be alright?”</p><p>Deadpan, Reina and Shiori raised their Witch Blade covered wrists 
simultaneously.</p><p>“Good point.”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, at 
Takayama’s……………</p><p>Contrary to Asagi’s opinions, Masane and Reiji were NOT commencing 
affairs not of state. In fact, not only were they reviewing the material they had been 
given, but Masane broke the news to him that the Witch Blade could talk.</p><p>“Really?” he 
asked, though they both knew he wasn’t really surprised.</p><p>Masane told him how the Witch 
Blade couldn’t talk during the years Angelus and Darkness put a curse on it, and Reiji 
listened with rapt attention. He was about to ask what the Witch Blade had told her, before 
it asked Masane if she’s be willing to let it hijack her voice box temporarily and tell him 
personally.</p><p>[I was given the power of speech by my parents so that I might serve a 
guide to my Bearer.]</p><p>Takayama blinked. He was in full stoic mode tonight, thus he had 
a pretty high resistance to being rattled, but he had to admit to being freaked out watching 
Masane’s eyes adopting a glazed look as a male voice spoke out of her mouth.</p><p>[You 
okay, Takayama-san?], asked the Witch Blade, noticing this.</p><p>“<i>I think he’s a bit 
weirded out to hear a guy’s voice from a lady.”</i></p><p>“<i>Ah. I’ll let you take it from 
here.”</i></p><p>That said, Reiji watch her snap back to normal, and before she opened her 
mouth, he said, “I think I’ll just take your word for it from now on.”</p><p>That said, 
Masane told him about the Witch Blade’s offer to tell her about its former bearers. Reiji 
thought for a moment, and then asked, “Why don’t you write it down?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“You 
know, the Witch Blade has had a long and fruitful history, serving Justice, and now that its 
existence isn’t much a secret anymore, it might be good to have a public record of the 
Justice it has striven to uphold.”</p><p>Masane had to admit to herself that maybe that 
wasn’t such a bad idea.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, back in the city, skulking 
around like the gutter trash he had been in life was an ExCon. Like the thug he had been in 
life, he carried a switchblade, looking for some dumb bitch to shank.</p><p>In life, he had 
been a low life, two bit mugger who had a misogynist hatred for women, but considering he 
had sexually abused by his mother, sent to live with some bitchy aunts after mommy dearest 
was caught, and his one attempt at a girlfriend was using him as revenge on another guy, it 
wasn’t much of a surprise he had a loathing of the fairer sex.</p><p>He had turned to crime 
as a way of venting his frustration. His favorite tactic was to go find a random female 
passerby, drag her ass into an alley, threaten her at knife point and let her know how much 
of a filthy bitch they were, then he’d take any money they were carrying, sometimes taking 
their ID or driver’s license as a trophy. For the most part, the money was a bonus, and his 
violence towards women was mostly for the evulz.</p><p>One day, though, proved to be his 
last. It had gone all too well. The bitch complied, and when he told her to pick up her 
dropped purse, and hand him her money, she bent down, and appeared to doing just 
that.</p><p>Then irony made him her bitch as the woman yanked her own blade out of her 
purse, and buried it right in his chest. She missed his heart, and the shock made him drop 
his own knife, which allowed her enough time to grab it, and kill him with his own 
blade.</p><p>That had been his last memory, and one of the few he retained as an ExCon. 
Unlike most ExCons he not only retained most of his former life’s memories and human will, 
he had even realized that he was somehow half alive, but now was far more powerful, which he 
used to full advantage to brutally shank bitches like he’d done in his first 
life.</p><p>Tonight, he was hunting for some new prey, and he spotted some waifish little 
bitch leaving a flower shop and saying goodbye to some wrinkled old bitch. As she walked 
away, presumably to go home, he decided to stalk the bitch, waiting for the perfect time to 
strike, thinking to himself,</p><p><i>“I’m an axe crazy knife nut, and I’m fucking loving 
it!”</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the woman hating psycho, the 
three junior Witch Blades were walking around the block, and had been engaged in discussion 
over some facts all three wanted resolved.</p><p>Maria flat out asked Aoi what made her so 
lovable, and Aoi told her that not only was Maria the only one who had been nice to her 
(aside from Furumizu, but he didn’t count), Maria actually valued her for her, and not as a 
potential DNA jar. Maria was more than a little touched by this, and told Aoi she didn’t 
really have a lot of hang-ups about having a girl having feelings for her (given the fact 
that in her first life her and Aoi had indulged in some mutual groping), and told Aoi she 
wasn’t ready to have full blown sex yet, but she definitely valued her affections. Aoi 
literally made squeeing noises at this, and the mush factor got so high that Asagi 
pantomimed sticking her finger down her throat and puking in mock disgust.</p><p>Aoi then 
asked Asagi why she had defied Maria so much the first time round. Asagi told her bluntly 
Maria not only refused to accept good advice, but she had acted like a dumbass, thus 
following her orders was idiotic. Maria, oddly, agreed with Asagi, acknowledging that Asagi 
was correct, and telling her that one of the reasons she wasn’t giving orders this time 
round, or attempting to was partially because Angelus and Darkness designated Masane to have 
that role, and she wasn’t really any good at it, now that she was sane enough to think about 
it.</p><p>As for Asagi, she asked the other two what their plans were after the ExCons were 
all dead. Neither of them had thought that far, but Asagi had, even telling them that now 
they weren’t in danger of going crazy and getting mind fucked, she wanted to maybe get a 
boyfriend, learn how to drive, and generally enjoy life the way most other people did. This 
immediately prompted Aoi and Maria into silence as this possibility had yet to occur to 
them.</p><p>“AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!”</p><p>The terrified scream of a young lady echoed 
across the street from a nearby alleyway, and this immediately interrupted any reverie they 
might have entertained. Transforming, they hauled ass for the alley. Once there, they saw 
some seedy looking asshat in a soiled leather jacket, black pants, and a week’s worth of 
stubble holding some girl at knife point, telling her to shut the fuck up, bitch, and give 
me your fucking money. She didn’t have any, and before she could disappoint him, he noticed 
Aoi and Maria.</p><p><b>“Who are you crazy bitches?!”</b></p><p>Maria gave him a slasher 
smile as she and Aoi unsheathed their blades and she told him,</p><p>“Your worst nightmare.” 
and actually waited a beat before adding,</p><p>“Bitch.”</p><p>The thug’s switchblade looked 
like a thumbtack compared to their ridiculously long pig stickers, but the dumbass merely 
tossed aside his now paralyzed with fear victim, and leapt backwards, trying to get some 
room to maneuver, but that idea was shot down as he felt the flat edge of a sharp blade 
pressed against his neck.</p><p>“And what the hell do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>The 
thug was so shocked; he dropped his knife and raised his hands in surrender. Asagi, who had 
surprised him, merely shoved his ass to the ground, spitting on him and 
snarling,</p><p>“Don’t try this shit again, dickhead.”</p><p>With that, Aoi picked up the 
now petrified girl, and they took their leave.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, back at 
Marry’s, Reina was worrying about the junior members of their nakama, especially because 
their hour was nearly up, and Marry found it both disconcerting and amusing to watch the 
normally calm Reina pace back and forth like an expectant father.</p><p>In fact, Marry was 
more than a little surprised about all the ladies Masane had brought back with her. Aoi was 
a meek little waif of a girl who seemed deeply attached to Maria, and basically was the 
quiet one. Maria was kind of quiet herself, and Marry kept wondering why Maria kept wearing 
a guilty look from time to time in Reina and Rihoko’s presence. She knew they were related 
to each other, but it did worry her that Maria seemed to be reluctant to open up to her 
mother and sister. As for Rihoko, she was currently tuckered out, sleeping like a log 
upstairs.</p><p>Shiori was like an older and slightly more outgoing version of Aoi, and she 
seemed to be infatuated with Reina, which merely confirmed in Marry’s mind that not only was 
Shiori a lesbian (as apparently were Maria and Aoi, come to think of it), but Reina was 
apparently bisexual, seeing as she did have a daughter with Takayama (not that these 
revelations actually bothered her, as they seemed to be fairly discreet about it). However, 
it was Asagi who really commanded her attention.</p><p>She had gathered that all the girls 
had escaped in one way or another from some crazy science cult of some sort, and not only 
did it strike her as interesting that Asagi seemed the least shell shocked, it also worried 
her, seeing as Asagi seemed almost apathetic and distant. So, acting on some bizarre 
motherly instinct, she found herself trying to mother the girl, and found out Asagi really 
hadn’t been exposed to the concept of a mother, and had at first been apprehensively to her 
efforts. Once the ice broke (when they went shopping for bras), Asagi had later thanked her 
for the help, and she seemed to warm up a little, though her clothing was still rebellious 
and her manner deadpan, bordering on smart assed.</p><p>That said, it amused her that Reina, 
whom she had seen act very taciturn (and occasionally dictating certain things she had 
experienced or been told into that recorder she always carried), was now wearing a groove in 
the floor, doing what any ordinary mother would do and fretting about her children. As she 
watched Shiori try to reassure her they’d be alright, she idly wondered where her remaining 
male tenants were, before remembering Yuusuke was helping out Kyoko’s massively enlarged 
workload by being her late night assistant (and maybe more than that), while Cho was 
currently in his hacker cave of a bedroom, watching porno (what else was new?). Speaking of 
that, it had simultaneously amused and scared her that a day ago Cho groped Shiori’s ass, 
and she transformed, unsheathed her blade, and threatened to make him a 
eunuch.</p><p>Watching him almost soil himself was pretty hilarious.</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>Meanwhile, back with the junior Witch Blades, they had de transformed and were 
now trying to calm down a very shaken young lady, who was currently twitching like a leaf 
and hyperventilating. Asagi and Aoi kept telling her to calm down, but to no 
avail.</p><p>What did work was when Maria, taking a page from her mother’s book, hugged her, 
and gently told her it would be alright. The girl suddenly started to relax, and as she held 
onto Maria, calming down, Maria felt an odd feeling in her chest.</p><p><i>“So, this is what 
it feels like to have someone comfort you”</i>, she thought, remembering she felt just like 
this when Reina forgave her in the Other Realm. As the other girl finally stopped shaking, 
she asked Aoi and Asagi to look out for any trouble while she sat on the sidewalk with the 
girl they rescued and asked her name.</p><p>With a mild bit of stammering, “Y-Yuriko 
Mazaki.”</p><p>“I’m Maria Sohou. Are you hurt?”</p><p>“N-no……just a little 
scared.”</p><p>“That asshole won’t get another chance to hurt you.” said Asagi, voice cold 
enough to emit frost.</p><p>Yuriko clammed up at that, and before Maria could tell her to 
shut up, a light bulb came on in Yuriko’s head, as she remembered something she had seen on 
the news.</p><p>“You guys were on TV, weren’t you?”</p><p>Maria smiled, “Yes, we 
were.”</p><p>Her next question shoved a dagger in their hearts and twisted it.</p><p>“Was 
that man Furumizu my father?</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Back in the alley………………</p><p>The thug 
couldn’t believe he had been so terrified of some bitches, but having seen those blades, his 
memories of getting shanked to death flashed in front of his eyes, and all he could do was 
panic.</p><p>Now he was able to think again, rage had replaced fear, and an unnatural light 
burned in his eyes as he got up. As he did, a powerful feeling of energy infused him, and 
somehow, he could sense the very bitches that had stopped him.</p><p>He laughed as he calmly 
walked out of the alley and resumed stalking his prey.</p><p><i>Those bitches were gonna 
pay!</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The horror had not yet passed, as Maria, Aoi, Asagi, and 
Yuriko walked towards Marry’s, where Maria told her quite possible Sister they might be able 
to find out the truth. As they walked briskly there, Yuriko told them her story, and Asagi, 
Aoi, and Maria felt their inner horror grow as what they remembered matched the description 
of the man Yuriko called “Father”.</p><p>“He told me I was special, then he told me I was no 
longer a suitable Neogene, and he jabbed me with a needle, and then I woke up, and I 
couldn’t remember anymore. Why did he hate me?” Yuriko finished, almost stumbling over her 
words as she realized that she was possibly talking to members of the family she had once 
known.</p><p>“That bastard was using you, Yuriko.” growled Maria. “He told me the same 
things; told I was special, gave me attention and felt me up, telling me I was perfect, all 
so I could be his fucking DNA receptacle!”</p><p>Yuriko squeaked in fear as Maria’s anger 
temporarily exploded, but relaxed as Maria regained her composure. As this happened, Marry’s 
came into view.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Meanwhile, the ExCon had by this time fully 
transformed, and was still moving slowly towards his objective, murder on his mind and 
hatred in his heart, feeling himself needing to kill and maim, and not giving a shit why, 
just knowing he would be cutting some more dumb bitches who were stupid enough to fuck with 
him……………</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Inside Marry’s, Reina’s plans to scold the girls for 
worrying her died in the womb as she saw them bring in a young, frightened young lady with 
solemn, serious expressions. Just as she was about to ask who Yuriko was, Yuriko looked at 
her, and suddenly felt a blank spot in her memories reveal itself as she said in 
surprise,</p><p>“Dr. Sohou?”</p><p>Reina’s mouth fell open in shock. The only associations 
that title ever had for her was amongst her professional scientific associates at the NSWF 
and Douji, and with the-</p><p>“You’re a Sister?” she gasped, sitting down from the shock. 
Marry saw that as a good opportunity to exit, stage left, not understanding what was going 
on, and realizing she probably wouldn’t understand, and she quietly headed up to her room. 
Meanwhile, Yuriko proceeded to tell her story, and towards the end, Reina’s eyes widened 
with shock as she realized who the young woman was.</p><p>“You were the one the rest of the 
Sisters always called “quiet little Yuri”, she said after a moment, sadness evident in her 
voice.</p><p>Yuriko didn’t remember this, but instead sat there quietly, a feeling of peace 
returning to her as she realized the sisters she had once had she was back with 
again.</p><p><b>“I’M GONNA CUT YOU BITCHES!!!!!”</b> screamed a malevolent, somewhat 
metallic voice outside.</p><p>“Is that that asshole we had to pull off Yuri-“, was what 
Asagi started to say, but got no farther as their Witch Blades all glowed with energy, 
begging them to transform.</p><p>They all knew what that meant.</p><p>“Stay here, and let us 
protect you!” Reina commanded as she and the others transformed. As they did, Yuriko saw 
they looked scary, but decided to trust her Sisters, so she nodded as they rushed outside to 
take the ExCon down. Meanwhile, Marry and Cho popped out of their rooms, wondering what the 
noise was, and Yuriko pointed outside to where the Witch Blades were assembled and said in a 
quavering voice,</p><p>“My Sisters are protecting me.”</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Outside, the 
Witch Blades were in a line formation watching the ExCon step into view. As it did, Maria, 
Aoi, and Asagi all realized it was same guy, but he looked different.</p><p>His arms and 
legs looked like the corkscrew innards of a manual pencil sharpener; his head was shaped 
like a crab. One arm had a huge claw with massive pincers, and the other a huge, serrated 
blade. As soon as it saw two more had joined the party, it made a contented noise, then 
charged forward, blade raised.</p><p>The Witch Blades scattered as he lashed his claw and 
blade out alternatively, screaming murderously, then he looked inside Marry’s, where he saw 
Yuriko, and laughed,</p><p>“FOUND YOU!”</p><p>His attempts to charge inside though were 
stopped as Shiori body checked his ass, knocking him off balance, while Aoi and Shiori 
joined in, smashing the bastard in the head with the flat end of their blades, trying to 
drive him back. Miraculously, the ExCon held its ground and swung its claw like a flail, 
knocking them both aside, and then turning again to go for Yuriko. He was then intercepted 
by a bladed high heel to the face by Maria, who upon landing, jumped forward to slash at the 
ExCon’s throat.</p><p>She was blocked by its blade, and she got smashed into the ground by 
the claw arm. The ExCon laughed as he raised his blade to slit this bitch in half, but as 
his blade came down, his sword was intercepted by Reina, who was parrying his attack, but 
barely, screaming,</p><p><b>“WAIT!!!!!”</b></p><p>The ExCon pressed his blade against her 
own, feeling her sword being forced aside by his own. As he proceeded to force her blade 
aside, he asked,</p><p><b>“WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU, BITCH?”</b></p><p>As he said this, the 
sword he had parrying turned into an energy blast that knocked his ass backwards by about 15 
feet. As another blade appeared in Reina’s hands, glowing with raw energy, she charged the 
fallen ExCon, screaming,</p><p><b>“YOU DON’T DESERVE TO KNOW MY NAME!!!!!!”</b></p><p>Filled 
with bloodlust and motherly anger, she jumped over his body and proceed to slash downwards, 
trying to slice his body in half, the ExCon’s claw shot up, burying into her stomach, and as 
the ExCon forced his body to a standing position, his claw grabbed the stunned Reina and 
smashed her into the pavement as well.</p><p>Fearing he was about to do to her what he tried 
to do to the still stunned Maria, the others charged forward, hoping to overcome him with 
sheer force, but to their horror, his claw fired an energy blast that blew them all away. As 
it did, Reina recovered long enough to see the ExCon rare back, about to kill her.</p><p>In 
that moment, Reina knew fear, but not for herself. This monster tried to kill her daughter, 
and wanted to kill a defenseless girl, much like Maria (when driven insane by Furumizu) had 
been when she had to defend Rihoko. As the blade arm came down, Reina knew she couldn’t die 
and leave them defenseless.</p><p>That’s when she felt a gigantic energy field from her 
Witch Blade surround her and explode in the ExCon’s face.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>From 
inside Marry’s, Yuriko had been tempted to run outside and offer herself up as a sacrifice 
to save Reina from death, but just as she was about to, light surrounded her fallen form and 
blew the monster away. As the light started to fade, she and everyone else saw Reina, and 
their jaws fell open in shock.</p><p>Reina and her armor had changed. Its normal pink tones 
had suddenly darkened to a deep magenta, and her normally blue body markings were glowing 
crimson. Her hair was now platinum white, and she now wielded two blades. Her shoulder and 
leg armor now was covered in spikes, and most impressive of all was the fact she bore a 
force field the color of her armor that completely enshrouded her body, which was crackling 
with energy, and her back now sported two metallic wings that seemed to emanate their own 
power. As her foe got up, Reina, who was now floating above ground, merely staring 
impassively as the ExCon sized up his new threat. Seconds later, it charged, screaming it 
usual lines about how it was gonna cut her, but Reina merely floated sideways, clothes 
lining the ExCon with one of her blades, saying just loud enough for everyone to 
hear,</p><p><b>“The day you raised your blade to slay innocents was the day you forfeited 
your life.”</b></p><p>Despite the fact he had pissed her off, the ExCon decided to resume 
his attack on Maria instead, and charged for her position, and though she had just about got 
over her dazed feeling, the ExCon wasn’t going to give her time to recover as it charged her 
position.</p><p><b>“NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!”</b></p><p>As she said this, her wings spilt 
into many bolts of energy that flew at the ExCon and started slashing away at its body. 
Despite being energy, each strand of power felt like each cut he had ever given a woman, and 
as the death he was feeling from the thousand cuts was adding up, he broke free of the 
energy cloud and ran for Reina, planning to kill her and run.</p><p>His blade smashed 
against her energy field, as did his claw. The look of Reina’s face reminded the ExCon of 
the woman who had killed him as she used each of her blades to slice off his arms with 
almost contemptuous ease. The ExCon didn’t even have time to scream, as her force field flew 
forward, knocking it to the ground, and as it looked up at Reina, all he could see was his 
first killer as his second plunged one blade into his body, then the other. As she withdrew 
them, the light faded from the ExCon’s eyes as a final scream of pain and terror emanated 
from its throat.</p><p>As it died, so did the energy field, and as Reina sank to the ground 
in exhaustion, her transformation faded as she collapsed, and the ExCon’s corpse glowed with 
energy, then with a flash, disappeared from the face of the Earth.</p><hr size=1 
noshade><p>Yuriko made her way outside, having watching the monster die at Reina’s hands and 
Reina’s subsequent collapse. As she and the Witch Blades made their way over to Reina, 
bright light enveloped the entire area, and they all heard the voice of 
Angelus,</p><p><b>“Fear not, Neogene. I am The Angelus, and it was on the orders of myself 
and The Darkness that your life be saved.</b></p><p>The Witch Blades stopped in their 
tracks, as did Yuriko, as Darkness’ voice joined Angelus.</p><p><b>“Yuriko Mazaki, you were 
abandoned and abused by the Trespasser Tatsuoki Furumizu and taken from the family you had 
always known, and our servants saved you from the abominable creations of 
Man.”</b></p><p>Yuriko didn’t know what to say, and Angelus continued, “<b>We would offer 
you sanctuary, child, that you may regain that which was lost, and you may bond anew with 
thy sisters.”</b></p><p>“Y-you k-know where my s-sisters are?” she replied, feeling 
terrified and excited to know her family still existed.</p><p>Darkness voice could be heard, 
<b>“Yes, child. They are guests in our domain, and we would offer you a place at their sides 
so that you may have what was taken from you, and that your mind and heart might have the 
solace of happiness with those who love thee.”</b></p><p>Yuriko looked at the other Witch 
Blades, who merely nodded in affirmative, and Yuriko answered their voices.</p><p>“I-I 
accept your offer.” she managed, feeling tears of happiness flow down her cheeks.</p><p>As 
she said this, the lights grew to blinding extremes, and as they faded, Yuriko was gone, and 
as the lights faded, they all heard Angelus say,</p><p><b>“You have served us well, and may 
your service in our names save more innocents from the sword………………”</b></p><p>As her voice 
faded with the lights, the other Witch Blades, now de transformed moved to help the tired 
Reina up, and as they helped her walk back to a now stunned Marry and Cho, a smile resounded 
in their hearts as they now knew Yuriko’s unhappy past was to be reconciled.</p><p>And 
somehow, they later discovered, Rihoko had slept through it all.</p>
