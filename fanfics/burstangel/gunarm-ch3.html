<h1>Gunarm (part 3 of 19)</h1>

<a href="../burstangel/gunarm-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;Jo, would you cut that out?&quot; Jo was still staring at her hands, and Meg 
rolling her eyes because dear god did Jo have a short attention span, 
tried to keep her irritation in check.

Yes. Calm. She was calm. Deep breathe. Deep...

Jo hadn&#39;t stopped staring at her hands and Meg--with a small prayer sent 
up to the heavens in hopes of some benevolent god listening--promptly 
slapped them away from her face, like she was a small child.

Okay, now she was calm.

&quot;Jo, look at me, I really think I need an explanation.&quot;

It was then that the other girl had turned to her with her hands offered 
up, like they held within them a gift that could wipe these past few 
horrible days out of her memory. Unfortunately, those offering hands 
were empty, and Meg suddenly thought about these nice pair of earrings 
she had found, but didn&#39;t have enough money to buy. Then she thought 
quickly that this was neither the time nor the place, since she wouldn&#39;t 
forgive Jo for earrings. Although if she threw in a bouquet of flowers 
then maybe she could...

No!

&quot;Yes Jo, we all like your hands, now&quot;-

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant.&quot; Meg stopped herself from replying. There was 
something in Jo&#39;s voice that made her want to sit down next to the girl 
and console her, but she beat that reaction down. She couldn&#39;t forget 
that she was having a fight here.

&quot;These hands...I&#39;ve done a lot of things with these hands.&quot; Meg without 
her having realized it had sat down next to Jo on the steps, 
inexplicably drawn to the other girl and the strange words that were 
coming out of her mouth.

Meg nodded her head wanting for more than anything --more than anything 
in the world--for the other girl to continue.

&quot;Things that...I don&#39;t regret, or feel sad over. I&#39;ve killed, I&#39;ve 
maimed with these hands. I&#39;ve hurt so many people and I won&#39;t take those 
things back.&quot;

They were now facing each other. The setting sun spilling orange light 
over the pair and catching dusk motes that tumbled in the air.

Meg felt herself hold her breath.

&quot;You&#39;re,&quot; Jo looked to the side, and her eyebrows furrowed together in 
what Meg had to say was the strangest expression the other girl had ever 
worn. &quot;You&#39;re clean.&quot; Jo really looked like she was struggling with her 
words, and balling up one of her hands in a fist she held it in front of 
her face.

&quot;This is...the only thing I have to offer to you.&quot; Jo then placed the 
other hand on her shoulder and shook her as if she was in a daze --for 
all her sense, she probably was--The other hand unclenched and she 
brought that one to rest on the other side of her shoulder.

&quot;Are you fine with that, Meg?&quot; The shock of having Jo&#39;s hands on her, 
the girl&#39;s red eyes staring right into her blue ones, and the soft 
warmth from the departing sun were making Meg wonder if they were having 
a moment. Then it hit her like a ton of bricks, that they 
were--indeed--having a moment. Her and stone-faced Jo were having a 
moment. She thought she would have keeled over in shock, but 
surprisingly, she was too caught up in her long-awaited moment that she 
could hardly look away from Jo.

&quot;That&#39;s not fair to you. I don&#39;t want to be unfair to you. I just want 
you to know that...I think you deserve better than this, Meg.&quot; The hands 
on her shoulders clenched around her bare shoulders. They were warm, so 
warm, and with Jo so close Meg could smell her. She could smell all the 
scents that made up the other girl. Strong scents: gunpowder, the 
leather she used to holster her guns, and the soap she used to try and 
wash it all away. This was Jo, Jo&#39;s scents, Jo&#39;s calloused, warm 
fingers, Jo&#39;s beautiful eyes.

It didn&#39;t hit her fast enough that she was leaning forward in Jo&#39;s hold. 
She suspected that that had something to do with the whole being caught 
up in the moment thing and the way Jo didn&#39;t seem to be pushing her 
away, like she always did. And so, before she knew it, she was wrapping 
her arms around Jo and burying her nose in the other girl&#39;s neck, trying 
to get more of that smell, the really nice barely there smell that was 
buried under all the guns and violence. It was cool, like wind and Meg 
couldn&#39;t identify it even if she did know the exact name for it, but if 
there were that fitting name for it, Meg would have liked to think it 
would be called freedom.

Jo had stiffened up in her loose embrace and Meg knew that wasn&#39;t a good 
sign, but damn if she wanted to let go. Well, Jo would just have to 
tough it out and let her do this, surely the other girl had gone through 
worst situations. She didn&#39;t think that Jo could die because of a small 
hug, and anyway, she had hugged Jo as many times as she had been 
kidnapped. Oh jeez not a good comparison.

&quot;Jo, I don&#39;t really understand what you&#39;re trying to tell me, but to 
tell you the truth, I don&#39;t care about any of that stuff. None of it 
ever mattered. The only thing that ever mattered...was...well...you, 
Jo.&quot;

She pressed herself further into Jo to demonstrate her point, a point 
that she had been trying to make for some years now, but was never given 
the chance.

The sun was losing its brilliance out to dusk, as the sky turned a dark, 
feathery pink that brushed against the heavens like a warm hand. A few 
bright stars were uncurling their luminance from behind clouds that 
seemed like melting cotton and Meg turning her stare directly to the 
faint fingernail moon in the sky watched a flock of birds wrinkle the 
glow as they passed in front, like a petal touching the surface of a 
pond.

Jo had her eyes closed and was breathing deeply, taking in the scents of 
the night, of Meg&#39;s hair pressed up close to her face. The drifting 
redolence of lilacs and vanilla, and the smells underneath all the 
sweetness: Nail polish, plastic, lipstick, leather, and the metal from 
the large gun she towed behind her. This was Meg, defined by her 
fragrance and the softness of her manicured fingers, and her stubborn 
touch.

Jo opened her eyes and looking down at Meg, she found herself pressing a 
kiss on the top of her red head. Meg lost within her own world of memory 
and sensory had startled awake. She could hear the chirp of cicadas and 
the cry of migratory birds as their flight carried them onward toward 
another star in the far away sky, but those weren&#39;t the things she was 
paying attention to. No. She was paying attention to the space between 
her and Jo and how with each passing breath how it seemed to get closer 
and closer, until...

&quot;Meg, did you guys make up yet because I gotta go outside and you two 
are blocking the way out.&quot;

Meg turned her head sharply to the side, and spotted Amy, with her hands 
on her hips, at the top of the stairs, staring down at them in all her 
moment-killing glory. She turned her head back to Jo, and Jo was slowly 
getting up and pulling away from her.

NO!

She turned her head back up to glare at Amy, aka Moment-Killer as Meg 
was now going to dub her as, and she felt her left eye twitch as the 
brunette was fiddling with her hair, looking completely unapologetic for 
the murder she had just committed on Meg&#39;s love life.

&quot;Did you two work things out?&quot; Someone else was approaching the door and 
Meg could now make out Sei, the matronly features, somber with concern.

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re fine. It was nothing. Look, good as new.&quot; Meg now on a new 
mission to dispel the worries from Sei, pointed to herself, then Jo, her 
commenting as if on a broken machine instead of a human relationship.

Sei smiled warmly at them, like the big sister she was and Meg letting 
out a relieved breath suddenly felt like taking it back as Jo started 
for the door to the RV.

&quot;Ah, Jo, ah where are you going? I thought&quot;-

Jo turning from her vantage point on the top step met Meg&#39;s gaze for a 
brief second before breaking eye contact and going back inside.

Meg wasn&#39;t sure if she should follow or just wait things out, but one 
look from Sei seemed to confirm the latter in her head.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Meg, Jo&#39;s just...,&quot; Sei smiled warmly at her and Meg felt 
the burden in her chest buoy up like a gasping swimmer.

&quot;Yeah, Meg, Jo&#39;s shy.&quot; Amy--Moment-killer, that name was going to 
stick--popped a gum ball in her mouth and then went forward with chewing 
noisily and obnoxiously for a good second or two until the flavor was 
gone. &quot;I would have never guessed Jo could be so...,&quot; She blew a bubble 
the size of her face, popped it and started smacking away again, in a 
effort to finish her sentence, &quot; so cute, huh?&quot; She grinned and flew up 
the stairs to go harass any living creature within her vicinity. Kyouhei 
had better watch his ass.

Meg tried to comprehend fitting the word cute into the context of Jo. 
She pictured bunny rabbits, she pictured pink jump ropes, she pictured 
sweaters with panda bears on them and then she tried to fit Jo in this 
picture and it went along the lines of Jo using the bunny rabbits as 
target practice, Jo using the pink jump rope to strangle random bad guy, 
and Jo using the cute sweater as a rag to clean the barrel of her guns.

Cute, yeah right...more like sexy. At the thought, Meg giggled to 
herself stupidly and attempted to do away with the goofy expression 
smeared all over her face as she made her way into the RV, closing the 
door behind her.</pre>
