<a href="../burstangel/gunarm-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>&quot;You&#39;re getting closer.&quot;

Jo was walking at a brisk pace as she shoved her way through the 
stubborn crowd.

&quot;You&#39;re so close that you&#39;re red hot.&quot;

She could instinctively feel eyes on her.

It didn&#39;t help that she had left her guns with Leo in her rush to put 
distance between herself and Meg. The feeling only seemed to intensify 
with each forward step, each breath and each wave of adrenalin that beat 
through her system.

&quot;Red like Meg&#39;s hair.&quot;

This thing, this person, this whatever it was definitely knew how 
psychological warfare worked. It definitely knew how to play her and 
goad her and shake her up.

&quot;Red like her fingernail polish.&quot;

The only thing that was driving her forward, other than her adrenalin 
was her hatred for this voice and the fact that when she was finally 
face to face with this thing, she would beat the ever-living crap out of 
it.

&quot;Red like her blood.&quot;

She was now under an indiscriminate skyscraper, looking up at it and 
trying to get any visual on her enemy.

&quot;Tsk, tsk, you&#39;re lukewarm yellow now.&quot;

Dammit. Where the hell was the bastard hiding?

&quot;You keep looking up at the sky. I can tell you right now, I&#39;m no god. 
But I&#39;m close, so close.&quot;

&quot;Fucking hell.&quot; She swore, right in front of the skyscraper and right in 
the midst of the pavement, loud enough for the people passing by to give 
her strange looks.

&quot;I&#39;m right behind you.&quot; It taunted and Jo swiveled around, anxious and 
angry to get this fight started.

But the only thing she was met with was the infinite crowd of people she 
had passed on her way here. She was being jumpy and foolish. There was 
no way this person would be in the crowd. She would have seen them, 
sensed them, she would have noticed...

&quot;Unlike god, when you call out for me, I come.&quot;

&quot;Then give me a name to call out.&quot; She said, desperate for this conflict 
to come to an end. It was the first time she&#39;d ever felt rattled before 
a fight.

People were ignoring her on the whole, but only a bold few were staring 
right at her and whispering words that she did not care to hear or know.

&quot;I can&#39;t do that. Because then the curse will be broken and the Princess 
will be set free.&quot;

&quot;Goddamit! Then just come down here you nutjob.&quot; She was full out 
screaming now and the shock of her voice stopped some pedestrians dead 
in their tracks.

&quot;I can&#39;t do that.&quot; It repeated again, like she hadn&#39;t heard it the first 
time.

Jo put her hand over her eyes, trying to stop her anger from making her 
dizzy. It was one thing that her enemy was close by, it was another 
annoying ass thing when she couldn&#39;t find that enemy and the fucker was 
taunting her.

&quot;I can&#39;t do that because...I&#39;m no longer anywhere near you.&quot;

Jo removed her hand from over her eyes.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you know? A god is prohibited from fibbing.&quot;

It was like this...thing was having a conversation with someone else in 
her mind and she, the hapless onlooker could only witness this one-sided 
conversation and attempt to pick at the pieces, the words, like a scab 
and uncover the problem, the infection, the cure.

&quot;Keep in mind that I&#39;m not a god, Jo.&quot;

&quot;Then why...?&quot; Why the hell did this thing drag her out here? What the 
fuck was going on?

&quot;How fast do you think you can run back to Leo&#39;s? Do you think you&#39;ll 
make it in time?&quot;

&quot;Make it in time for wha&quot;- And suddenly everything was snapping into 
place and making sense. Oh dear god, she was such a fool. &quot;You piece of 
crap, if you even go near-&quot;

&quot;But I already have. And there&#39;s not a damn thing you can do about it, 
freak!&quot;

Jo stood there shell-shocked, not because of the sudden harsh tone the 
voice was using, but because this thing, it had known how she would 
react and it had counted on that reaction. It knew she would blindly run 
into enemy&#39;s territory, into enemy&#39;s sights and that when she did, it 
would strike her unprotected loved ones.

&quot;Have fun with the crowd.&quot;

There was silence on the other end, a bleak silence that further 
conveyed her defeat and her mental trauma to that defeat.

The crowd, also as if in agreement with the silent mockery the voice had 
imparted on her with its departure was still tightly compact, an almost 
impenetrable wall of bodies that even with her sudden angry burst of 
vehement shoving and cursing only parted slowly.

If only she could fly. She looked at the arm that had the wing tattoo 
and wished with all her might that those lines edged into her skin, the 
flat, curving and outstretching pattern that represented a far off 
abstraction of human religion and ego, that it would come alive, sprout 
up from her skin, from the right side of her shoulderand usher her up to 
the sky. Even if it was only able to produce one feasible wing. She 
would rather be a one-winged angel than flightless.

&quot;Move!&quot; She barked because in reality this was the only thing she could 
do. She couldn&#39;t fly. She wasn&#39;t a god. She could only continue to shove 
her way through the crowd and halt her step due to circumstances not 
within her control, as the bodies all around her pressed in from all 
sides.

How could the street be so crowded!

She&#39;d never seen it so bad.

And not just that, but the bodies around her didn&#39;t feel soft and 
vulnerable like the bodies she was used to encountering. They felt 
sturdy, almost like they were padded down. Almost like they...

Someone suddenly pushed her from her blind side.

She stumbled into someone else and it felt like she hit a wall.

&quot;You should watch where you&#39;re going, miss.&quot; A man&#39;s voice plainly said, 
and then a hand was clutching her arm and ripping her away and into 
another direction.

The crowd, if it was possible had gotten denser.

She could smell something like oil and turbine rich in the air.

Like freshly carved out prosthetics parts, rotten blood and the grim 
from the city streets.

Someone hit her on her blind side, right in the ribs and the impact 
knocked her into another set of hard bodies.

Was this what that voice had meant when they&#39;d said to have fun with the 
crowd?

She again felt someone grab onto her hand and squeeze, bone shifting 
under bone as she wrenched her arm free and kicked the person in front 
of her to give her enough room to get away.

She saw another hand reach out, she heard someone scream out of the 
circle of bodies she was currently trapped in. She heard more screams 
and the sound of stampeding feet.

So...her enemies had mixed themselves in with the normal crowd. But if 
she had to guess, they were no longer dispersed, but all around her in 
this very confined circle they restricted her to, with only a few 
stragglers scattered around the streets.

The scent of them was thick.

Normal body replacement parts didn&#39;t smell like this. They smelt more of 
medicine; they smelt more of sterilized plastic and not of gunpowder and 
blood.

She&#39;d always had a good nose for blood. She reeked out of it, so it 
wasn&#39;t hard to figure out who her fellow murderers were in this crowd.

The strong smell of industrialized heavy ore and iron, fused with blood 
and rotten tissue wafted from the circle she was trapped in. The sight 
of them was normal enough, but she couldn&#39;t always trust her eyes. They 
were misleading, unlike her nose.

She grabbed onto a boy with blond hair, his baby face an ideal cover for 
the blood and guts he reeked off. He let his true colors show when she&#39;d 
gotten his hand in a lock and started pulling, hearing not the normal 
pop of dislocated bone, but the grinding away of steel upon bolted 
joints.

He howled and tried to strike at her face with his suddenly sharpened 
fingernails, but she tossed him and his body intercepted with another 
assailant.

She stumbled back into another body, this one reeking of sweat and 
drugs. Her arm had collided with his face, her elbow smashing his nose 
and driving it into his skull as she used his body to barrel through the 
angry crowd at her back. She let him fall and using the space she had 
opened for herself, she put her foot back, drove it into the hard 
concrete under her and boosted forward, plowing her knee into the 
unlucky bastard in front of her.

He went down hard. It was an instantaneous knockout and she used his 
body as leverage to hop from him and onto the next victim. She&#39;d ended 
up with her hand smothering his face, her fingers locking around his jaw 
until she felt blood and heard a crunch. He was falling back and she 
forward and she let the momentum set her up for a kick, her boot 
grounding into the temple of another unluckily positioned bastard, 
watching his face practically cave in from the force, his body suddenly 
knocking hard into the lamppost to his right.

There was blood. A lot of blood and it was all oozing out of the kicked 
man&#39;s head. Strangely though he was getting right back up and she had to 
watch as he stumbled forward, smearing blood on the person to his left 
and skidding on his own blood when he stepped into a forming puddle at 
his feet.

She couldn&#39;t take her eyes off of him, even though there were more 
enemies to be dealt with, she could not look away, because this man was 
clearly missing a part of his head, the somewhat pink, oily gloss of a 
brain poking out of the ripped flesh. She stared at it entranced, 
because brain matter always looked much different in real life than in 
horror flicks.

Especially when that brain matter was somewhat pulsing around his wound 
and glowing. That bright sickly, greenish, white light that made her 
instantly remember her own personal encounter with this thing.

He was limping forward, aggressive as ever and still reaching out for 
her with his split nails and bloody palms.

She could suddenly see the nerves and veins in his face, like he was an 
anatomical dummy instead of a real, breathing human being. All the blood 
seemed to have drained away from his face and the veins became more 
pronounced, a bluish-green hue that was matched by the faint color from 
the deep gash on the side of his temple. Something like tentacles was 
slithering all over his face and simultaneously reaching out to her.

She took an unconscious step back.

Of all the places to run into this thing, why did it have to be now!

The man halted in his step, like he had run out of batteries and then he 
was groaning loudly, painfully, his hands going up to clutch at his head 
as he tipped back and forth like a drunk.

She switched her stance to her strong side, her dominant shoulder in 
front of her now and the man was suddenly struck out of his daze by the 
sound of her shoes scuffing the pavement.

He ran directly at her and she pulled back and socked him in the face. 
He was unconscious before he hit the ground. The brain was still moving 
around and she jumped over him and using that same dominant shoulder she 
plowed her way through her assailants.

It was hard.

Her progress still being impeded by the sturdy bodies and their questing 
hands that almost knew her every move. It was her rotten luck or the 
smarts of her caller that kept her from taking higher ground. The 
skyscrapers above her loomed dangerously and unforgiving, and it made 
her want to curse them for being so sorely out of her reach.

When she came out of the circle, she was covered in blood that was not 
hers and bruises that were. Her shoulders ached, but she knew they would 
heal by the time she made it to Leo&#39;s. She was a fast healer. She was 
also a fast runner.

She could make it.

She would make it.

She had to make it.
