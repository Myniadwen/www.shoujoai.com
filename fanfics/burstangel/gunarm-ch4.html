<a href="../burstangel/gunarm-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Dammit, watch where you goin&#39; stupid bitch!&quot;

&quot;Oh man, we got here too late.&quot;

&quot;So you wanna go see Lockbet or the other one that was showing later?&quot;

&quot;These jeans are really tight.&quot;

Jo sweeping through the crowd with a hawk&#39;s eye scanned the area for her 
target, which she thought, wouldn&#39;t be too hard considering who it was. 
She didn&#39;t have much time left to meet up at the checkpoint, and so 
checking her watch, 19:00 on the dot; she walked out more into the open. 
It was a foolish thing to do, especially noting all the people scurrying 
and dallying about. A group of children on hover skates suddenly flew 
past in a flurry of garbage and leaves, knocking down a pedestrian and 
gaining some choice words from a few others that had witnessed the act. 
They chuckled about the shouts aimed their way and then skidded to 
wherever they had been headed, spray cans brandished in their snotty 
little hands like spoils of war.

There was somebody breathing down her neck, someone had knocked into her 
shoulder, and a baby was crying out in the distance. Jo taking out her 
headphones placed them on, and raised the volume to drown out the sounds 
and the drone of the loud speakers blasting announcements.

She walked out of the immediate crowd, moving toward her checkpoint, 
which had been decided on to be the extravagant water fountain in all 
it&#39;s Rococo glory at the Lazar Movie Complex. She didn&#39;t want to get 
wet, but seeing there were no nearby benches that weren&#39;t filled to the 
capacity with people, she found an edge on the fountain, and sat down 
quietly. She could --unfortunately-- still hear the sounds of the 
bustling crowd as it seeped past her headphones and picked at her 
nerves.

&quot;C&#39;mon, c&#39;mon, I ain&#39;t got all day.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s going to be that rave tonight at Chizuru&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Kawaii!&quot;

&quot;Jo.&quot;

If she could still hear the voices of the crowd, then the music blasting 
through her earphones couldn&#39;t rightly be called heavy metal.

&quot;Check out the sound system they got rigged up there.&quot;

Raising the volume, Jo stuffed her hands in her flight jacket and 
concentrated on the music filtering through her brain.

&quot;Jo. Jo, hey is anybody home?&quot; Snapping her attention away from the 
puddle near her feet that she had absently been staring at, Jo turned 
her inward focus outward to converge on the woman standing in front of 
her.

&quot;What took you?&quot; Jo flicking a stray white strand out of her face with a 
toss of the head, prepared to stand up and get on with business.

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that. I had to look pretty. This is a date, after all.&quot; 
Meg, with the same toss of head came to stand beside Jo, slipping a hand 
around Jo&#39;s elbow and pulling until she got the other girl to her feet.

Jo rolled her eyes because she thought that Meg looked pretty everyday 
and that an hour wasn&#39;t going to change that fact. Although, watching 
her flutter around in her blue dress and white high-heeled shoes did 
make Meg look...different. Jo decided that it was a good difference right 
off the bat and apparently so did some guys who were walking by them.

Meg looked annoyed at the new sets of appraising eyes and suddenly 
turned her head sharply to the side, so she could block them out.

&quot;I think you look nice.&quot; Different nice, she didn&#39;t look like everyday 
Meg, but she looked...

&quot;Nice? That&#39;s it? C&#39;mon Jo, that&#39;s something you&#39;d say to your visiting 
grandma. Don&#39;t I look...?&quot; Meg stopped her sentence, as if she wanted Jo 
to finish it, however some approaching guys did that honor.

&quot;You are one sexy mama.&quot;

Jo thought those weren&#39;t exactly the words she had been searching for 
either, but she commended the idiot for trying.

&quot;Woah.&quot; One of the guys had taken off his shades and was looking Meg up 
and down, noticeably stopping at her chest and legs that were mostly 
uncovered by the shortness of the dress.

Meg didn&#39;t look too happy about the attention.

The guy, who had spoken first was moving closer to them, his eyes 
traveling from Meg to her with a sneer.

&quot;Who&#39;s this? Your boyfriend?&quot;

Huh?

She turned to Meg, who suddenly looked like a beet, the color of her 
face matching her hair a little too much as she sputtered and moved in 
front of her.

&quot;What? Jo&#39;s my...I...sorta my...,&quot; she then went even redder in the face and 
Jo looked the guy in front of her dead in the face.

&quot;Oh my bad. Dude, that&#39;s a chick.&quot; The person in front of her started 
pointing at her and speaking, as if she didn&#39;t know what he was saying. 
She could understand the mix-up. She wasn&#39;t wearing her normal get-up. 
Meg had told her to go out and get something to wear that wasn&#39;t full of 
holes, or wasn&#39;t her normal clothes. She hadn&#39;t really understood what 
the point of that was, but she had gone along. She&#39;d bought some jeans 
and thrown those on, but everything else was pretty much the same. She 
still wore her black tank top, and to hide that fact, she had thrown her 
gun jacket over it, not to mention she still wanted the ability to carry 
her guns around without alerting the nearest police station.

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and up close like this, she&#39;s actually kinda hot.&quot;

That seemed to get Meg&#39;s attention, because before Jo could even blink, 
Meg had pushed the guy on the shoulder and away from their personal 
bubble.

&quot;Man, if you say so.&quot;

The guy stumbled back a little and smiled smarmily at Meg. &quot;Cut me some 
slack, honey. I didn&#39;t mean to upset you or your nice friend here.&quot;

The fire that usually burned in Meg was ignited and she shook her fist 
at the man with unconcealed rage. &quot;I don&#39;t care, just get your ugly mug 
out of my face before I do something about it.&quot;

The two men turned to each other and suddenly burst into raucous 
laughter, alerting everyone within the area to their presence and the 
situation.

&quot;She&#39;s feisty. I like her.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot;

Jo narrowing her eyes because this was getting annoying and real fast, 
grabbed Meg by the arm, and pulled her to the entrance of the movie 
complex. They were going to miss the movie if they didn&#39;t hurry the hell 
up.

&quot;Wait, wait. Where you goin? That&#39;s not nice.&quot;

She could always use her guns on them, but with the amount of civilians 
in the area, she would surely attract more attention and probably start 
a riot if she wasn&#39;t careful.

Suddenly one of the guys had jumped in front of her and really, no one 
could blame her for what she was now doing, because it was a reflex, an 
involuntary--well not so much--reaction to this stranger jumping in 
front of her. He had startled her a little, and she had reacted how she 
would normally react, when someone was dumb enough to get in her sights, 
when she was on edge and annoyed.

She broke his jaw.

Not her fault. Completely not her fault, even when the guy was rolling 
around on the ground and his friend was trying to calm him down.

Meg, who had witnessed the punch to the face --that had probably smashed 
some of this guy&#39;s teeth, and reduced his mouth to a bloody pit--was 
swiftly grabbing her by the arm and pulling her into the crowd.

Damn, this date was already in trouble.

&quot;Ah, maybe we should go to another movie theater. This one seems a bit 
crowded. Right Jo?&quot; Meg laughed anxiously and then picked up her pace, 
when she saw an officer breaking up the crowd.

&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s get out of here. This place stinks anyway.&quot; Meg pulled on 
her wrist even harder, and soon they were down the sidewalk and cutting 
a fast retreat down the streets.

&quot;Sorry Meg.&quot; It seemed like the thing to say, well other than, that guy 
completely deserved it, and did you see how much blood there was, or did 
you count how many teeth were scattered on the sidewalk. My all time 
best.

Yeah, Jo thought she had chosen the best response to this string of 
events. Well, something that wasn&#39;t going to cause Meg to sit on the 
sidewalk and cry, or shout at her.

&quot;It&#39;s not your fault Jo. That guy deserved it.&quot; It was too bad she 
hadn&#39;t gone with her first choice, since Meg thought he&#39;d deserved it 
too.

&quot;Those guys were being mighty assholes and I thought you handled the 
situation...with finesse.&quot;

I didn&#39;t know you could break a guy&#39;s jaw with finesse.

&quot;Where are we going now?&quot;

Meg turned to her, like it was some sort of crime that she didn&#39;t know, 
&quot;Where else, but the movie theaters.&quot;

&quot;Well turn around then.&quot;

&quot;Not that one, a better one.&quot;

By better, she had better mean quieter.

&quot;Oh look, there it is.&quot; Meg was pointing to the old cinema building that 
had been losing business, ever since the new one had been built a couple 
of blocks away. It was a million times quieter than the other; it even 
kind of reminded her of a haunted house.

Jo took an immediate liking to the place.

So they bought their tickets, got popcorn, and had a nice time trying to 
pick out the perfect spot to watch the movie from. They practically had 
the entire place to themselves.

&quot;Isn&#39;t this great? And we were thinking about going to that other one?&quot;

She gave Meg a strange look, since she hadn&#39;t been the one to suggest 
where this date would take place, and Meg waved her off.

&quot;It&#39;s starting, shush.&quot;

She gave Meg another strange look, because she wasn&#39;t the one who had 
been talking either.

The previews were boring and Jo wasn&#39;t expecting much from the movie 
after five minutes of dialogue. She had to remember that Meg was the one 
who picked it out, after all.

She nodded off twice, had Meg pinch her five times and yawned loudly 
once.

She couldn&#39;t say she was enjoying the movie without it sounding like a 
heinous lie, but she could say she was enjoying Meg&#39;s company, even 
though those pinches had stung a little. Watching the other girl smile, 
and laugh, and enjoy herself was enough, more than enough to keep her 
entertained, even if the movie did suck like glowing brains.

The couple in front of them was making out like they&#39;re lives depended 
on it, and Jo with an annoyed expression, kicked the chair because Meg 
was trying to watch the movie, and she didn&#39;t need them messing up the 
experience for her.

The couple broke apart, stared at them angrily and then moved.

Mission accomplished.

Meg turned to her and questioned her with a confused expression. She 
shrugged her shoulders.

Then halfway through the movie, she thought she had heard Meg yawn 
--well at least she wasn&#39;t the only one who thought the movie was 
boring--and then watching Meg through the corner of her eye, she could 
see the redhead stretch and place her hand on the back of her seat.

Meg looked at her, like she was checking something, and then turned away 
just as quickly.

They sat like this for a good portion of the movie, and Jo feeling the 
presence of the arm behind her head, grabbed onto it with one of her 
hands. It startled Meg, enough where she thought the other girl would 
fall out of her seat, luckily that hadn&#39;t been the case. The dark and 
the comfortable seats were again starting to wear her down and fixing 
Meg&#39;s arm around her shoulders, she was able to use it as a makeshift 
pillow as she curled close to her and nodded off.

Meg surprisingly hadn&#39;t said anything, and so she had woken up an hour 
later with a stiff neck and a blushing Meg.

All in all, Jo wouldn&#39;t mind going on one of these dates again in the 
near future. Actually she thought a small part of her was anticipating 
it.</pre>
