<h1>Gunarm (part 6 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../burstangel/index.html">Burst Angel</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sakuraz.html">Sakurazukamori6</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../burstangel/gunarm-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;Man, this field is huge.&quot; Meg said impressed, her arms spreading 
themselves out as if to contain the massiveness of the land.

Jo stooping over the green grass and passing one hand over it, hovering 
over places where the grass pushed up brown and crisp blades, where the 
grass was barren and smelled dirt. &quot;I can still smell the blood.&quot; Jo 
said. Meg, who was still blown away by the vast land and air around 
her--growing up in city would do that to you--turned to Jo with a 
disgusted expression.

&quot;Jo, what are you talking about? I don&#39;t smell anything, but grass and 
the smoke from that barbecue place we passed on the way here,&quot; Meg 
rubbed her stomach, &quot;And the wind sure isn&#39;t helping by blowing the 
smell over here. Man, I&#39;m so hungry.&quot;

A quiet family with a picnic basket was walking by; they all had their 
heads bowed and their faces solemn in the afternoon&#39;s cloudy skies.

Meg and Jo watched them go along and Meg had hoped her stomach wouldn&#39;t 
make any noise and disrupt the family&#39;s shared contemplation. Sekigahara 
was a sacred place after all, many brave soldiers, many brave men had 
died here and many people had come here to pay respects and homage, even 
after four centuries. As the couple and their two sons passed, the air 
was filled with black tension, the type that would collect at funerals 
and Meg was afraid that she would embarrass herself--and Jo--in front of 
the procession.

Jo nudged her in the arm, and with a deep and quiet voice-- that could 
be easily lost by the moist wind-- told her to relax. She replied 
vexingly that she couldn&#39;t relax. There was a certain etiquette that was 
to be abided by when people came to places like this. Jo gave here a 
strange look for that and Meg feeling herself blush profusely, said that 
Sei had told her how to behave.

Likewise, Jo said because Sei had also stopped her on her way to the 
door this morning and told her to behave like a...young lady, i.e. do 
not bring guns or just bring one, and when someone was getting on your 
case, for the love of God, do not sucker punch that person and then walk 
away without calling an ambulance.

Jo hadn&#39;t agreed to any of the status quo expected of her by the older 
woman. She hadn&#39;t even given a terse nod or a simple ok, by way of 
placation. She had only walked out of the door because Meg had been 
waiting for her outside. Sei had taken that for an agreement that she 
would follow all conditions and Jo had let her believe that. Of course, 
she still brought her guns--yes two of them, no need for restraint--and 
she still planned to punch or kick or break bones or all of the above if 
someone was being a royal douche to Meg or her. That was just a gimme, 
but the date so far hadn&#39;t required any of those things from her. It had 
just been quiet and relaxing and...fun.

They&#39;d visited a sword smith on their way to Sekigahara and Jo had 
finally understood the saying &quot;kid in a candy store&quot; or better 
translated, &quot;Meg in a candy store.&quot; Gifu had once been known for its 
sword working and Jo, highly interested, thought that it would give her 
an excuse to buy a new weapon.

Sei had never said anything about not buying some souvenirs. So when she 
asked the old sword smith if he had ever tried to weld one of the small 
swords onto a...hmm...let&#39;s say a semi-automatic, gas operated pistol, 
and then had pulled out her Desert Eagles from the holsters, and then 
pointed to where she thought the wakizashi he was currently working on 
would best fit, she was quite certain that this was the perfect souvenir 
to take back to Tokyo with her.

The sword smith looked like he thought her idea of hybrid sword/gun was 
a very interesting combination, and they both, for about fifteen minutes 
talked about the details that would go into making this dream weapon a 
reality.

Meg had pulled her away by the hand, and told her that something like 
that sounded really, ridiculously expensive, and why the hell do you 
need more weapons when you have your Desert Eagles, Jango, and yourself. 
Plus, the money Sei had given her to hold onto--a wise choice now that 
Meg thought in retrospect--and that if they wanted to eat today, Jo 
would have to find it within herself to do without her sword/gun 
combination.

Jo shook her head in understanding and then went on to ask her if she 
could still get the wakizashi, and since it was between a katana and a 
knife, it wouldn&#39;t be cumbersome and hard to carry around.

Meg had promptly dragged her out of the store and apologized to the 
sword smith.

Jo made a promise to herself that when this date was over, and Meg was 
happy with her, and she had secured another of these dates that she 
would go see Sei about a weapon&#39;s modification and get the funds to come 
back here.

They had spent a couple of hours at the Sekigahara battlefield. Visiting 
the shrines, listening to the stories, walking around the fields and 
breathing in the air, and finally succumbing to the smells coming from 
the barbecued pork at the restaurant by the entrance.

&quot;Ready to go yet, or do you want to stay for a bit?&quot;

&quot;No, let&#39;s go. I need to talk to Sei about something?&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

They&#39;d reached the small inn that they were staying at by cab and went 
straight to Sei&#39;s and Amy&#39;s room.

&quot;Oh, you two are back. How was your date?&quot;

Amy chiming in from her place on her bed, teddy bear laptop open and 
buzzing as her fingers sliced over the keyboard, said, trying to sound 
as obnoxious as possible, &quot;Yeah, how was your dateeeee?&quot; Her smile 
turned predatory and Meg coming over to the smaller girl bobbed her on 
the head.

&quot;None of your business. I&#39;ll tell you when you get older.&quot; Amy&#39;s eyes 
widened, and then she was giggling into her palm and winking 
conspiratorially at Meg, who was winking back as well.

Jo didn&#39;t understand this kind of behavior and turning to Sei had told 
her the date was nice and that she wanted some minor modifications on 
her guns.

Sei, looking at Jo questioningly, didn&#39;t know if she should ask about 
what gun modifications and her date had in common, or just slowly back 
away from the room.

&quot;Hey we were just thinking about going to that Onsen town up in the 
mountains. I mean if you come to Gifu, it&#39;s a must.&quot; Amy waving her 
finger in the air suddenly pointed it at Sei. &quot;Let&#39;s go now!&quot; She was 
bouncing on her knees on the bed and Amy who was also sitting next to 
her, looked excitedly at the older woman. &quot;Can we Sei? Can we? Oh that 
would be so much fun!&quot;

Sei couldn&#39;t say no to those faces and in all about a second had told 
them, &quot;Alright, if you girls go get your bathing suits, then we can go.&quot;

There was loud clapping and then a mutual shout of &#145;yeah&#39; coming up from 
the two girls on the bed as they scampered off to find their bathing 
suits. Jo was still standing by the door and seeing the expression of 
joy on her companion&#39;s faces, went to go look for her bathing suit as 
well.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Look at how many hot springs there are. Look!&quot; Meg pointed at the many 
bamboo divisions that circumscribed off the onsens. Tugging on her arm 
and pulling her along as they walked down corridor, the concrete ground 
cold under their feet and the air clammy with steam and the freezing 
winds from the Alps.

&quot;They say this is quite the experience, the cold air from the mountains 
and the hot steam and that there effect relaxes the body even further.&quot; 
Sei pulled the small towel tighter to herself as it began to slip.

&quot;Hey Sei, couldn&#39;t you get a bigger towel? It&#39;s probably the same size 
as mines.&quot; Amy made a lifting motion with her hand in the direction of 
Sei&#39;s chest and the towel, and Sei blushing pink, tried her best to 
cover herself.

Jo had opted to put on her black bathing suit, the hassle of hanging 
onto a flimsy towel not all that appealing to her. Meg had gone the same 
route as Sei and Amy and was currently sporting one of hot spring&#39;s 
small towels. It wasn&#39;t unusual to see Meg in small bits of clothing, if 
anything, it would have been weird to see her in something that actually 
covered her up. That was just how Meg was, that was just how she liked 
to wear her clothing, and Jo had seen enough midriff, high skirts and 
cleavage to last her a lifetime. It was normal, but what wasn&#39;t normal, 
Jo decided, was that suddenly the short cut of the towel and the fact 
that half of Meg&#39;s chest was sticking up from her towel was...starting 
to...distract her.

Really distract her.

She chalked it up to having nothing better to do. Since there were no 
bad guys to concentrate on and take out, or her television hadn&#39;t been 
brought with her.

Meg oblivious to the state of her dress, bickered back and forth with 
Amy wildly, the one hand not used to hold up the towel waving around in 
the air and making her scantily clad state even more apparent, 
especially with all the movement...

Jo had nearly ran into a bamboo poll, luckily for her, Sei had grabbed 
her arm before any real damage could occur, like for instance, on her 
pride.

&quot;Is something the matter Jo, you seem, out of it?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Jo brushed off the gentle hand on her shoulder and Sei not 
taking offense--because that was just how Jo was--let the girl go 
without any further questioning. Jo&#39;s stare still focused on Meg tried 
to figure why she had this uncontrollable fascination with watching the 
red head. She could admit that Sei was just as anatomically...filled out 
as Meg was, even more so than Meg and yet, Jo took a sidelong glance at 
the older woman, Sei didn&#39;t hold her fascination one bit. She was 
pretty, Jo understood the qualifications that determined beauty in this 
society on a woman, had seen enough of Meg&#39;s magazines and seen 
billboards to know what people found desirable. Sei held all those 
attributes and then some. Judging her and Meg by unbiased standards, by 
other opinions and by observations of the two out in the city, Sei was 
more attractive to men than Meg was. Jo could see that, and she had no 
problem with admitting that Sei&#39;s maturity and elegance were things that 
seemed to take on tangible substance in the older woman&#39;s looks, unlike 
Meg who was immaturity personified and that most likely turned a lot of 
people away.

Even so, ask her a million times over, and Jo knew her answer would be 
the same, if someone were to ask her which she preferred, which she 
thought was beautiful and irresistible and just amazing. Meg was all of 
those things and Jo was relieved that the people around her weren&#39;t 
privy to the qualities of Meg that made her so special. If that were the 
case, then there would definitely be stiff competition for the red head 
and Jo didn&#39;t think she would be able to take them out fast enough with 
just the aid of her guns...though Django would definitely have no 
problem wiping them out. Jo couldn&#39;t help but think that these concerns 
were somehow a question on her morals system and that she should 
seriously consider her values if she wanted to continue to stand for 
justice and the right way as a Cybot pilot. The situation of what if 
playing through her consciousness--Meg&#39;s safety or the safety of random, 
innocent citizens of Tokyo--Which one was more important? Of course she 
would choose Meg without a second thought and let the citizens 
die...which now that she thought about it...seemed a little selfish, but 
whatever...It was her choice to make and no one else, and she would just 
have to pray that Sei never asked her this question because she didn&#39;t 
feel like lying and she sure as hell didn&#39;t feel like getting Django 
taken away.

Upon reaching the end of the corridor, Sei opened a bamboo gate and 
walked into the onsen, Amy hot on her heels and already throwing herself 
into the hot water with a loud splash and a sqee. Amy and her were 
standing awkwardly by the gate and Sei dipping her legs into the water 
smiled at them.

&quot;You know, there&#39;s another empty onsen on the side of us. Why don&#39;t you 
two go make yourselves comfortable over there.&quot; Sei knowingly waved them 
away and smiled that motherly smile that made everything okay. Amy who 
was now splashing and trying to doggy paddle her way over to the other 
side of the large hot spring shouted at the pair, &quot;Yeah go over there. 
There&#39;s not enough room here for Meg&#39;s fat head and fat butt.&quot; She 
cackled at her words and Jo wondered how a little girl managed to make 
such a scary sound. Meg face flaming more than her hair, whipped her 
fists at the smaller girl. &quot;My head is not fat! And my butt&quot;- She turned 
and looked at the rear end in question- &quot;My butt is not fat! You brat!&quot; 
She threw up her hands like they were on fire and then said, &quot;C&#39;mon Jo, 
let&#39;s go, before we get Amy&#39;s cooties on us.&quot; This comment was followed 
by Meg sticking her tongue out at the younger girl and stomping back 
down the corridor. Jo followed after her, and heard the call for her and 
Meg to be careful and to be good.

&quot;My butt is not fat.&quot; Meg still stuck on this one thought, turned to her 
and asked, &quot;Jo, do you think my butt&#39;s fat.&quot; Jo caught off guard by 
this, stared at the red head for a while. Meg was looking at her as if 
she really wanted an answer and Jo simple gave her a...

&quot;No.&quot;

Meg watched her like a hawk and when Jo didn&#39;t volunteer a further 
explanation to why she didn&#39;t think Meg&#39;s posterior was fat; the red 
head took her reticence as something else.

&quot;Jo thinks my butt is fat.&quot; Jo didn&#39;t get how Meg could come to this 
conclusion, when she had just not even a second ago had said otherwise. 
&quot;I don&#39;t diet or anything, but maybe...&quot; She looked at Jo with a 
pleading look, &quot;Would you like me better if I was skinnier Jo? Huh?&quot;

Huh?

Jo was silent again, because she didn&#39;t know how to answer this question 
without it turning out like the previous one.

They were entering into an unused onsen and Meg shutting the tall gate 
behind her, looked like she was still waiting for an answer.

How was she going to answer this? She didn&#39;t even think it was a fair 
question, since it was kind of vague to her. It was an objective 
question. People had different taste, what one might consider fat, one 
might consider skinny, or even unhealthy. It was dependent on many 
factors: height, age, metabolism...and really the only time Jo 
considered someone had a weight problem was if their body weight kept 
them from carrying out a gunfight with her.

Meg wasn&#39;t fat...that was easily seen by the fact that she could keep up 
with her in a gunfight. &quot;You&#39;re not...fat.&quot;

&quot;Hey, why do you sound so damn hesitant?&quot;

Jesus Crap. It was like she couldn&#39;t win with her.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re talking about? What does being fat have 
to do with anything?&quot; Jo moved to go into the hot spring and Meg still 
holding onto her towel opened her mouth, only to close it again.

Jo continued, &quot;I mean, Amy has called you many names and you have never 
asked me if you were stupid, or ugly, or have rocks in your head, or 
needed medical attention, or if there really is a tape worm in your 
stomach?&quot; Jo finished her sentence as she submerged her whole body into 
the water and leaning back, she watched Meg who had opened her mouth 
again to say something.

&quot;I...well...it&#39;s different.&quot; Meg clutched her towel harder and dipping 
one foot into the water, began to lean her weight on it and enter into 
the hot spring. She took a seat next to Jo and then stared out at the 
other side of the onsen, silent as a mouse and still looking like she 
wanted to say something.

She blurted out, &quot;It&#39;s different from that stuff. Amy&#39;s just being a 
brat and I know those things aren&#39;t true. Or I&#39;m not really...too self 
conscious about them.&quot; Her fingers were now treading through the water, 
rivulets dripping from her palm as she lifted it and dipped it back into 
the water.

Jo turning her attention to her companion, was about to say something, 
but got easily sidetracked when she noticed that Meg&#39;s towel had slipped 
down and disappeared. The steamy water was more than covering her in the 
chest department, but it was still really...

&quot;Sorry, I guess I&#39;m not making any sense.&quot;

...Distracting.

So distracting that she was still looking at Meg&#39;s chest, and Meg 
unaware of where her eyes were looking at, continued to stare forward 
quietly. Jo gulped, turned away, and then wondered if this had anything 
to do with the fact that they had shared a kiss two days ago.

She&#39;d seen Meg naked before, although this past year, as Meg had started 
to exchange her adolescent body for something else--as Jo tried not to 
stare exactly at that...something else--the other girl had stopped 
changing her clothes around her, and it seemed to Jo, started being 
more...secretive. She didn&#39;t know about what exactly, but it was there 
and Jo trusted her instincts enough to know secrets existed between 
them.

She could suddenly hear Meg breathing, the sound, even quiet was raspy 
and...

Jo looking up at the sky, like her solution existed somewhere between 
the clouds, contemplated what all of this might mean for her. She liked 
Meg...a lot and she cared for her and somewhere underneath her 
reservations and her quiet; there existed a binding emotion that secured 
them together, like unwilling participants in the arena of their lives. 
It was deep, and heavy and moved her inexplicably to actions that she 
would never have thought herself capable of doing, putting forth effort, 
or breaking from her accustomed habits.

An emotion that coexisted with her twisted view of the world, and yet 
was not tainted by it, or wasn&#39;t that affected that it needed complete 
sheltering from her.

She could have laughed a little at the realization, but it would attract 
Meg&#39;s attention, and then she would find herself attracted by something 
else, something in Meg&#39;s eyes and her body and her voice and her love.

It answered her back, like a chorus of angels, and before Jo could stop 
herself she was reaching her hand out to her, placing it near her 
collarbone, and sliding it up her neck, where the pulse had quickened 
and beat against her fingertips. She leaned in and Meg stunned by her 
actions and mouth open didn&#39;t object to her kissing her. Had melted at 
the first touch of lips and gone perfectly still like a flower after a 
storm. It took a couple of seconds for Jo to realize that this wasn&#39;t 
going to be anything like their first kiss, and wrapping her arms around 
the other girl, she crushed her up against her body. Her body was acting 
on its own, fighting the awkwardness that would come from her, because 
she wasn&#39;t experienced in this sort of thing, not in this type of 
contact and this kind of overwhelming touch. Meg&#39;s mouth was just as 
soft as she remembered, and the skin of her back, of where her spine 
dipped down and flared out into her wide hips was tender, supple, and 
slippery with the water, and Jo was scared that she was being too 
aggressive. That Meg wouldn&#39;t like it this way.

Meg made a tiny sound in the back of her throat, passed her hand over 
her side, where her ribs met her back and held her there. It tickled, 
felt like the wind was running up her sides, whimsical and lovely, and 
she made a disgruntled noise at the fact that she couldn&#39;t find a way to 
kiss Meg deeper.

She could feel the warmth of Meg&#39;s chest through her bathing suit, the 
press of it as it moved and all that supple skin, especially the flesh 
on the side of her breast, softer than anything she had ever felt, 
andrubbing her arm and making her stomach flip and clench.

She&#39;d grabbed her then, pulled until Meg was in her lap, and the weight 
of her was concentrated there. She was heavy, slightly heavier than her, 
but Jo couldn&#39;t say that she minded, not when she had held up weightier 
people and thrown them across a room, and especially not when Meg 
deliciously squirmed in her lap, the friction against Meg&#39;s chest making 
her nipples harden and nudge the skin under her collar bone.

She&#39;d taken a hold of her then, hadn&#39;t considered what would happen if 
she did, but in the blur of imminent pleasure, it didn&#39;t seem important. 
The breast in her hand was a firm, supple mound and her fingers had 
squeezed, curiosity and desire caught in a silken web of Meg&#39;s long red 
hair, as she buried her face in his neck and waited for the other girl 
to stop arching and shaking.

Meg was moaning now, loud and unfettered, and the sound of it had Jo 
moving her mouth on the other girl, until she had her mouth fastened on 
one of her nipples and was sucking it fiercely. Her hands which were 
holding up the red head, one on her back, steadily pushing her forward 
into her mouth, while the other was moving to settle on one of the 
girl&#39;s thighs. To rub it under her palm and feel it quiver under her 
touch.

Meg&#39;s moans were getting louder with each flick of her tongue against 
her nipple, and the tear of nails raking down her back, made her 
suddenly jump. Meg shrieked as her lips clamped down tighter and it was 
then that Jo heard it, the sound of feet on the other side of the gate.

&quot;Is everything all right in there?&quot; Someone was banging on the gate and 
trying to get it open. Meg leaning her head back now, as she came back 
from whatever high she had been on, made a surprised squawk as her arms 
slipped from Jo&#39;s shoulders, slippery from steam and she fell backwards 
in the water.

A man walked in, and Jo sitting there quietly, as Meg was flailing about 
and trying to right herself, wondered what the hell this bastard wanted 
that he would interrupt them...like that.

&quot;My god, are you two alright? I heard someone scream and I thought 
that&quot;- He had finally caught the death glare that she was giving him and 
he on some instinct that was buried within his stupid head, backed away 
a little.

Meg finally up and not choking on water, her face red and her towel lost 
somewhere blinked at him stupidly. &quot;Oh...ah...that was...you see...&quot; she 
breathed, &quot;I saw this huge...spider and that&#39;s why I...um...yelled.&quot; Meg 
blushed crimson at the mention of her scream and then was looking 
everywhere except her and the other man.

Jo collaborated, &quot;Huge...&quot; she turned to leer at Meg because there was 
something undeniably funny and sexy about this whole situation, &quot;The 
spider, that is.&quot;

Meg blushed and laughed and she&#39;d stupidly snorted some water up her 
nose.

The man, having worked at this place for some months, could never, ever 
remember having run across a spider. It was always the dead of winter 
here and a...spider?

&quot;Okay, well, I&#39;ll leave you two ladies to enjoy your bath, and if...the 
spider comes back, then call me, and I&#39;ll kill it for you.&quot; He smiled at 
the two of them.

Jo didn&#39;t smile back, just looked bored and narrowed her eyes at him, 
her voice mocking and biting as if she was taunting some enemy, &quot;Yeah, 
we&#39;ll call you if we see that...spider again.&quot;

For some reason, he didn&#39;t think that they were talking about the spider 
anymore. &quot;Well if you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot;</pre>
