<h2>a <a href="../burstangel/index.html">Burst Angel</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sakuraz.html">Sakurazukamori6</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../burstangel/gunarm-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>A/N: Remember guys, Takane shows up a short time after the whole Jo 
jumping dimensions business. So I&#39;m just keeping the timeline. Plus, 
it&#39;s a shameless excuse to use her in my story, because I love her 
annoying ass! Also another chapter will be right on the heels of this 
one, maybe two/three days, because this one was really short.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you guys won&#39;t open the door. C&#39;mon, I need a place to 
stay, you buncha&#39; cheapskates.&quot; Hanshin Squad Elite Division&#39;s Detective 
Sergeant Takane Katsu, Leader of the feared Kanbaku Gang, and general 
kicker of asses has now, for the past five minutes been banging on the 
front door of the Angel&#39;s home-base.

&quot;I came here to check out the sights of Tokyo.&quot; She rammed her booted 
foot into the door and even though it was fortified steel, it still 
seemed to shake at the power of one of Osaka&#39;s finest.

&quot;We really shouldn&#39;t have built that ramp for the trailer. Should have 
just stuck to the ladder. At least that kept nutjobs from kicking our 
doors.&quot; Amy, typing on her laptop and looking very bored with their 
current situation jumped up, despite herself when she heard a hammering 
noise.

&quot;Well, she&#39;s no longer kicking the door. That&#39;s for sure.&quot; Meg laughed 
as she munched on cookies and watched the door being unfairly brutalized 
by law enforcement.

&quot;Why aren&#39;t we letting her in again?&quot; Kyouhei asked, frightened for his 
life as he heard a thud and then silence. Most likely she had gone for 
backup or a bigger...stick.

&quot;Um, do we even have to explain?&quot; Meg shoved a cookie in her mouth.

Kyouhei realized she had a point when he heard the revving of a 
motorcycle engine.

&quot;Man, she&#39;s going to go Evel Knievel on us. Oh, I wanna see this.&quot; Meg, 
abandoning her cookie in favor of running to the cockpit to check the 
outside cameras was rewarded with the sight of Takane maneuvering her 
Harley up the small ramp.

&quot;Wow, she&#39;s good.&quot; Kyouhei impressed said over Meg&#39;s shoulder. He, 
despite having not agreed to the majority vote--Amy and Meg--of locking 
the policewoman out--for the mere fact she was the police!&#151;was now 
strangely excited to see what would happen when a 500 hundred pound 
Harley rammed into a steel reinforced door.

The possibilities were limitless.

&quot;Ten bucks says she puts a dent in the door.&quot; Meg, reaching into her bra 
pulled out a ten-dollar bill.

&quot;Ten bucks...cyber money says she dies in a horribly, painful, fiery 
death.&quot; Amy put up her hand, but there was no dollar bill, only the 
promise of it.

Kyouhei didn&#39;t know if it was good idea that they were now betting over 
the damage of property and...fiery deaths, but he couldn&#39;t say he didn&#39;t 
see it coming.

&quot;You&#39;re on!&quot; Meg shouted, as she slammed the money down on the table. 
She then turned to Kyouhei, &quot;Hey, aren&#39;t you placing down any bets?&quot;

&quot;I bet we&#39;re going to get in a lot of trouble from Sei when she finds 
out what happened.&quot;

Meg flipped her hair over one shoulder annoyed, &quot;That&#39;s not a bet!&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s a promise.&quot; Kyouhei said, resigned to the fact that he would 
be dragged into the business of explaining what happened when the older 
woman came home.

&quot;Look, look. It&#39;s starting. She&#39;s actually going to do this. Oh.&quot; Amy 
had an idea, or a scheme. &quot;I should upload this onto the Internet and 
then ask for donations for the injuries the police ladies gonna get.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s actually a good idea. You should make it out in the name of her 
family. Tell them to send everything to the relatives in Tokyo. We&#39;d 
make a killin&#39;.&quot; Meg said, getting back into money mode, even after 
years of rehabilitation handed out by Sei and Jo to cure her of her 
avarice with money.

&quot;Guys, I really think we should let her in.&quot; Kyouhei said, as he 
defaulted back to nervous mode.

The rev of the engine was heard again. Meg and Amy&#39;s eyes glued to the 
screen in anticipation for monetary profit or blood&#151;Either way it was 
bound to be entertaining.

However, the ringing of Meg&#39;s cell phone interrupted the sound of the 
revving machine outside. &quot;Oh, what is it now?&quot; Meg, flipping open her 
phone answered with a &quot;What d&#39;you want?&quot;

She certainly didn&#39;t expect the voice on the other end to answer back, 
&quot;I want you to open the door for Detective Takane before she dents my 
door.&quot; Click.

&quot;Oh shit. We&#39;ve been found out.&quot; Meg and Amy, rushing out of the room 
were then reminded by a now calmer Kyouhei that they should open the 
door for Sei and Jo, because they&#39;d want to get in too. Kyouhei, 
pointing to the screen that showed an impatient Jo, a still screaming 
Takane--who was making Jo less impatient because of her screaming and 
flailing--and a somewhat irritated looking Sei had the two girls running 
back into the room like they&#39;re heels were on fire.

Meg flipped the switch for the speaker outside. &quot;Hi Sei. We were just 
messin&#39; around with Takane. She&#39;s got such a great sense of humor.&quot; Meg 
said, trying to smooth this over for the best, because the last time she 
checked anymore cuts on her allowance wouldn&#39;t get her that purse she&#39;d 
been eyeing in the window of Fashion Flawless.

When she received no answer and only the annoyed staring from the three 
women, Meg knew when to admit defeat. She opened the door.

Amy, who had long ago retreated to her room--silently like a ninja, but 
cuter than one, she reminded--was erasing every and all evidence from 
the cameras that said she had been at the scene of the crime. Meg was on 
her own now.

Kyouhei and Meg met the three at the doorway. Jo, who was clawing away 
from the obnoxious woman--who was now going on about her Harley-Davidson 
and its power and maneuvering capabilities to care that the door was 
open--rushed through the portal, meeting Meg with a not-too-happy face.

It was enough that she had met Takane on her way back from a mission in 
front of her home, but it was past enough when she had to listen to her 
yell and threaten and blame all this somehow on her.

Meg, smiling weakly at her offered up a pathetic, &quot;We&#39;d have let her in 
eventually.&quot;

One of Jo&#39;s brows lifted skeptically, &quot;Right.&quot;

&quot;Honest.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Cold, that&#39;s what y&#39;all are.&quot; Takane said, and her words would have 
sounded hurt, if she hadn&#39;t at the same time banged down her fist 
angrily on the table.

Sei held up her hands, &quot;Now, now. We would love to welcome you to Tokyo; 
it&#39;s just not a good time. We&#39;ve been very busy these past days.&quot; Sei 
added in a move to placate the irate policegirl.

Takane considered Sei&#39;s response for a minute, her purple eyes scanning 
the woman before she sagged forward and waved a hand at her to forget 
about it. &quot;Naw, I won&#39;t take offense. I&#39;ve seen the mess Tokyo&#39;s in 
right now. And oh wee, do you guys have it rough. All those nutbags 
runnin&#39; around, waving around guns and...their robot puddles and what 
not.&quot;

Amy, who had come out of seclusion--finished destroying the 
evidence--and sitting next to Sei, said under her breath, &quot;Yeah, 
nutbags. You wouldn&#39;t know anything about that, would you?&quot;

Takane&#39;s head lifted up suddenly, like a rottweiler alerted to the 
presence of danger. &quot;What was that?&quot;

Sei nudged Amy in the arm. &quot;Oh nothing. So, you say you&#39;re on vacation.&quot;

Takane&#39;s intense purple gaze shifted its focus from Amy to Sei 
instantly, and the brunette couldn&#39;t help but breath out a sigh of 
relief at that.

&quot;Yeah, and no. Daddy says I need some down time after...well yuh know, 
and so I thought I might check out you folks over here, and see what all 
the fuss is about big, ole Tokyo. I gotta tell you right now, ain&#39;t so 
impressed.&quot; Takane, leaning back in her chair and crossing her arms 
nodded her head in shameless agreement with her opinions.

Sei at a lost for words said, &quot;Well..that&#39;s...good.&quot;

Then Takane bolted up from her chair, as if she had been administered a 
tiny electrical shock. &quot;I also came to straighten this place out. You 
wouldn&#39;t believe the asshole cops I ran into on my way over here. And 
let me tell you, I gave them a piece of my mind. They think twice about 
harassing innocent motorcycle riders again.&quot;

Sei still at a loss for words, now even more so since she had already 
used up her first response nodded her head.

Takane to her relief had changed her focus to someone else. That someone 
else now sitting and helping herself to a cup of ramen, quietly slurping 
and enjoying the hot noodles.

Jo, feeling those purple eyes on her and rolling her own deep colored 
irises, could do nothing but watch the girl as she came up in front of 
her and started pointed at her like she had the plague clinging to her 
face. &quot;And you! I can&#39;t believe you can just sit there and let all this 
happen, Miss Indestructible?&quot;

Jo gave herself a moment to think back on what Takane had just said.

&quot;Miss Indestructible? Now hold o-&quot;

Takane cut her off. &quot;You make me sick Tokyo. With yuh fancy-smacy guns 
and yuh big, dumb ole&#39; bucket of bolts.&quot;

Tokyo? Big, ole&#39; bucket of bolts?

&quot;You can speak badly about me, but don&#39;t bring Django into this?&quot;

Takane continued on like she hadn&#39;t even heard her. &quot;This place is 
fallin&#39; apart, and before that happens, I say we clean this city up.&quot; 
Takane with no consideration for the pizza boxes jumped up on the coffee 
table.

Meg, already fuming about the way Takane was talking to Jo had to watch 
as the last slice of pizza was squished under Takane&#39;s big boots, as the 
girl stomped her feet and pumped her hands up in the air. Like she was 
rallying her gang together. For all her knowledge, she probably was.

&quot;I hereby declare this the start of a new Tokyo. A better Tokyo, a Tokyo 
run the Osakan way!&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

So here she was. On a Saturday morning, walking the streets of dirty 
Tokyo and spending time with someone she would rather shoot at than have 
a conversation with.

&quot;Jo, look alive.&quot;

She didn&#39;t know how to break this to Takane, but this was how she always 
looked. And it didn&#39;t make sense to tell her to look alive when she was.

She could have said no. She really could have. She could have been 
eating another cup of ramen right now, or Kyouhei&#39;s delicious leftovers. 
She could have been with Meg. She could have been watching TV, but 
instead she was here.

&quot;That guy just looks suspicious. Doesn&#39;t he, Jo?&quot; Takane was pointing to 
a man with body tattoos, and Jo noticed when the girl&#39;s gaze had been 
caught by other &quot;suspicious activities, that said suspicious man was now 
helping, what looked like an elderly woman cross the road, probably his 
grandmother.

&quot;I got a good eye for these things. Always have.&quot; Takane put her hands 
over her eyes, her fingers formed into rings so she could stare through 
them like binoculars. &quot;Oh, is that drugs?&quot; The girl said, her hands 
still over her eyes looking like she completely forgot her pretend 
binoculars weren&#39;t real.

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back. You stay right here and cover me.&quot; Jo watched 
helplessly as Takane ran over to the group of elderly men playing cards 
in the doorway of a rundown apartment.

She didn&#39;t know why she let herself get dragged into this.

It probably had something to do with Meg, she thought with uneasiness.

This entire week she had avoided Meg like she was death on a stick.

It didn&#39;t seem so obvious now, not with all the missions coming their 
way. Jo, having to accompany Sei on many big league Mafia cases for the 
Bailan clan and Meg, having her own missions, but admittedly less 
dangerous and more to do with petty crime.

So she had thrown herself into their contracts with renewed zeal and 
come back with more blood on her than usual.

Admittedly it was the only way for her to deal with her inner turmoil.

Her method consisting of shooting people and...blowing things up.

It was working so far to distract her from her issues with their 
relationship, but she knew it would eventually catch up with her. And 
when it did, she would need a permanent solution. She&#39;d thought about 
sitting Meg down and talking to her, because they were adults--sort of. 
They could deal with this reasonably.

But then panic ensued when she had seen Meg enter the living room at 
that moment and she had fled her battlefield. She noticed she was doing 
that a lot recently.

It was stupid and cowardly of her. She liked Meg. She loved Meg. There 
was no question about that. She knew that much. It was a truth that had 
been reached through hours of questioning. She knew what it meant when 
you were willing to die for someone. When you were willing to hurt them 
selflessly and ruin the best damn thing in your life, all for their 
continued protection.

And she had deliberated with herself this past week to do just that. 
Tell Meg that she was scared their relationship was changing her, making 
her weaker and distracted and pathetic.

But truthfully, even if it was the noble thing, the right thing to do, 
it wasn&#39;t something she wanted to do.

It was eating her alive.

She couldn&#39;t face Meg like this. Couldn&#39;t face Meg when she was so weak, 
because Meg was used to seeing a strong Jo, a Jo that killed all the 
bad-guys, a Jo who protected her, who wiped away her tears, and who 
wasn&#39;t the cause of them.

Hence her reasons for avoiding the redhead and coming out here with 
Takane.

She&#39;d like to think she was stronger than this. But her mind...it was 
like it was against her. Every word she said in her defense, seemed to 
come out like a selfish wish to separate herself from reality.

Taunting her, making her see things that made her shiver and want to 
close her eyes against it, but couldn&#39;t, because it was thankfully not 
physically in front of her. Still didn&#39;t make her feel better when the 
possibilities of Meg&#39;s death, of different scenarios ran through her 
mind&#39;s eye.

It was disturbing.

It hurt her head and made her want to scream, because it really did feel 
like someone was penetrating her head with an ice pick.

&quot;Well that was a waste of time.&quot; Takane said, swaggering over, handcuffs 
swinging without any criminal limbs attached.
