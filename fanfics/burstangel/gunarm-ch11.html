And I&#39;m waiting.

And this time, you won&#39;t be able to escape me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Jo, do you need me to...help you carry anything?&quot; Meg, calling from 
behind Jo&#39;s bedroom door waited for the other girl to come out.

The door suddenly opened and Meg, always finding herself amazed at how 
quickly Jo dressed, got out of the way. Jo, who was still slipping on 
her jacket and fixing her guns in the holster looked up at the redhead, 
as said redhead smiled unsurely at her and self-consciously tucked some 
stray strands of hair behind her ear.

&quot;I can help you carry that?&quot; Meg said, looking down at the duffle bag 
that Jo had clutched in one hand. Jo glanced at her, one of her eyebrows 
lifted to inquire about Meg&#39;s sudden urge to help her carry extra parts 
for the Desert Eagles.

They were her guns. It was only normal that she carry them, on account 
of her knowledge of how to handle them. It was the same with Meg too. 
Despite the massiveness of her sniper rifle, Jo wouldn&#39;t aid her in 
carrying it around. If Meg didn&#39;t know how to handle her own weapon then 
she would learn through practice.

&quot;I can carry it,&quot; Jo said. She easily lifted the bag over one shoulder 
and then asked Meg, &quot;Don&#39;t you want Leo to exchange out some parts for 
you?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m fine.&quot; She added quickly.

Jo, looking down at her own feet and then to the side of her, her voice 
softer than usual, casually put out, &quot;It&#39;s a maintenance check. It 
wouldn&#39;t hurt&quot;-

&quot;Okay.&quot; Meg said suddenly.

Jo&#39;s eyes snapped back to Meg&#39;s face and it was the redhead&#39;s turn to 
feel unsure, as she looked down at the ground and shuffled her feet. 
&quot;I&#39;ll go get them. I&#39;ll meet you back here. Okay.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jo said, her eyes still on her face.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Meg backed away from Jo, smiled shakily and then suddenly turned 
around and bolted down the corridor loudly.

Jo watched her departure with a mixture of confusion and annoyance.

All morning Meg had been clinging to her more than usual&#151;not that Jo 
minded, Meg had always been wonderful company for her, but something 
about her attitude towards her today was...weird. She was being 
really...attentive, even cautious in the way she was handling her, like 
some small child, or easily-scared off animal.

It was...

Why was Meg treating her this way?

Last night, they&#39;d had sex. Really good sex, if she was any kind of 
judge on that sort of thing. She really (really) liked it and she&#39;d 
thought Meg had liked it too.

So what reason did Meg have for treating her like some type of invalid?

Did she not...do it right?

She could admit, she didn&#39;t know much about sex. The only things she had 
picked up was from watching television at a late hour and conversations 
she had stumbled onto when she walked through the uncensored streets of 
Tokyo. Sex hadn&#39;t seemed too hard and Meg had already given her a 
precedent to work with, although thinking back on her first time, it was 
a pretty high precedent that Jo didn&#39;t think herself capable of topping 
(Ever).

Meg was really good at sex.

Better than good. Amazing.

She was expert level, and Jo wondered distractedly how she&#39;d gotten to 
be so good...

But Meg had been a virgin.

Just like her.

And Meg would have told her otherwise if she wasn&#39;t. Right?

&quot;I&#39;m back.&quot; Meg said, a bit unnecessarily Jo thought, as she had heard 
her running (stomping) her way down the small corridor a long time ago.

&quot;You ready?&quot; Jo said, noticing the large firearm Meg was totting in her 
arms.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; She said, as she hefted the gun higher in her arms.

&quot;Do you need any help?&quot; Jo didn&#39;t know why, but Meg&#39;s attentiveness 
seemed to be contagious, because suddenly she was offering to carry the 
girl&#39;s gun.

She was making herself look like a hypocrite.

Meg looked startled and then smiled at her quickly, &quot;Oh no. I can carry 
it.&quot;

&quot;Uh, okay.&quot; Jo said awkwardly.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Today was the day. She was going to corner Jo and demand that she tell 
her what was going on. It was about time too, because it was past 
ridiculous the way they were dancing around each other and the subject 
at hand.

So yeah, today was going to be the day.

Right here, right now.

&quot;Jo, how the hell do you come back here a week later with the 
calibrations on your guns all fucked to hell?&quot;

Right after Leo finished talking to Jo. Yes!

&quot;I duh know. Figure it out, you&#39;re the expert here.&quot;

&quot;Aw Christ, you&#39;d think I&#39;d be used to your sassing me all the time. Get 
the hell out of here and let me do my work.&quot;

She noticed Jo&#39;s playful smirk at Leo&#39;s words.

&quot;I want my guns fixed. And fast. C&#39;mon Meg.&quot; Jo was already out the 
garage door and Meg, smiling at Leo ran after her. It was always such a 
strange thing to see Jo &quot;playful&quot; with someone. Jo smirked during 
gunfights when she was winning--but that kind of smirk had a deadly edge 
to it--She talked trash too. Although the big difference with Jo&#39;s trash 
talking compared to most others was that she could indeed back it up.

Jo had always been that way with Leo, though. They were kind of 
like...brother and sister, or...considering Leo&#39;s age, father and 
daughter. It was kind of nice to see them every time they sat down 
together and bickered about Django like&#151;Why aren&#39;t you easier on her? 
Or, dear god, jesus and luciver, this isn&#39;t some kind of toy, or what 
the hell do you mean you wanted to press that button to see what it did?

Thinking on it now, Jo kind of bickered with Takane too, although it was 
more of the fiery brunette screaming and shouting at Jo and Jo egging 
her on with her calmness. She had seen Jo tease the younger girl on more 
than one occasion too. It was pretty funny, but it had also&#151;at some 
point in time&#151;gotten her (a teensy bit) jealous.

She didn&#39;t consider herself the jealous type. She was level-minded 
enough to see that Jo had eyes only for her, but...

Quite frankly she was an attention hog.

It wasn&#39;t her fault.

When it had just been the two of them, Jo had spoiled her rotten with 
attention, although that goes without saying, since it had only been the 
two of them at the time. She&#39;d never liked to share Jo with anyone, so 
it was pretty hard to get accustomed to Jo leaving on missions without 
her and coming back at all of hours of the night to her bloody, and 
grimy, and smelling of death.

Sometimes she wondered what it would have been like if they&#39;d never come 
with Sei to Japan. She loved Japan though, even if it hadn&#39;t been a 
first home. It was the place where Jo had found her own type of 
happiness, and when Jo was happy, she was happy.

&quot;Jo?&quot; The white-haired girl turned to her.

&quot;Can we talk?&quot;

Jo made a move like she was about to turn around, but then halted. At 
that moment, she kind of reminded Meg of a mannequin. Unnaturally pale 
skin, combined with strange crimson, glasslike eyes and accentuated with 
white, doll hair.

Jo was already so different from other people and her physical 
appearance had only served to reinforce that idea.

Meg, coming up behind her put her hands gently on thin shoulders.

&quot;Last night...&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; She felt the shoulders under her fingers tense up.

&quot;You were actin&#39; kind of...funny.&quot;

Jo&#39;s shoulders still felt like they weren&#39;t going to loosen up anytime 
soon.

&quot;We could talk about it.&quot;

Jo was still not responding.

&quot;Jo?&quot;

Jo wasn&#39;t even making an attempt to pacify her. She was just standing 
there, breathing a little more loudly than usual and stiff as a board.

&quot;Please...talk to me Jo.&quot;

Don&#39;t do it.

She&#39;s just trying to win you over with guilt.

She&#39;s very conniving, don&#39;t you agree?

Using fake tears to get her way.

What a marvelous, beautiful pet she&#39;d make.

&quot;Shut up.&quot;

&quot;Jo?&quot; Meg shocked at Jo&#39;s sudden quiet, seething response pulled the 
other girl into an apologetic hug. &quot;Jo, I didn&#39;t mean to-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not talking to you Meg.&quot; Jo said, sweat dripping from her brow, her 
heart beating a mile a minute, her arm with the wing tattoo suddenly 
aching and her head feeling like it was about to split open.

Listen to the voice of reason within you Jo.

&quot;Who the fuck are you?&quot;

Why, you of course. Who else would be in here?

&quot;Stop it.&quot;

&quot;JO!&quot; Meg, coming around to face her, her hands clinging to her 
shoulders looked her in the face.

You&#39;re making a fool out of yourself.

&quot;I know my own voice. And you are not it.&quot;

Restrain yourself before she notices. I don&#39;t think you would enjoy 
spending the rest of your life in a stray jacket.

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t do that.&quot;

&quot;Jo, who are you talking to! What&#39;s going on!&quot;

Jo, snapping out of her anger suddenly noticed two, very large and very 
blue eyes inches away from her own.

&quot;Jo?&quot; Meg&#39;s sad and sotto tone was more than enough to wretch her away 
from the teasing voice in her head. She didn&#39;t want to be the cause of 
Meg&#39;s sadness, even though she had promised herself that despite tears 
from the redhead, she would do whatever it took to shield and protect 
her, even if it made a liar out of her.

&quot;Please Jo? Tell me the truth.&quot; However, it seemed that she had not 
sufficiently prepared/trained herself to withstand Meg&#39;s sadness, 
because suddenly she found herself speaking without her knowledge.

&quot;Somebody&#39;s...messing with me.&quot;

Don&#39;t do it-

&quot;What! But...how can they? How do you know that...Are they close by? How 
close are they, Jo?&quot;

Closer than you think.

Jo, grabbing Meg by the arms pushed her away. &quot;I need you to go get my 
guns from Leo.&quot;

&quot;But I can&#39;t leave-&quot;

&quot;Meg, go.&quot; Jo&#39;s eyes were hard as they stared at her.

There was a pause from Meg, her eyes wide and wet with leashed tears. 
&quot;Jo...&quot;

&quot;Go!&quot; Jo shouted, her eyes still hard and not giving an inch.

Meg flinched at the harsh sound, her mouth opening as her eyes shivered 
closed and she could stand it no more. She ran in the direction of 
Leo&#39;s, sparing a backwards glance and the sight of overflowing tears, 
before she disappeared into the building.

Jo watched her go before turning back around and heading in the opposite 
direction.

You&#39;re going to regret this.

&quot;I&#39;m not going to be one regretting anything.&quot;
