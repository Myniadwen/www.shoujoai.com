<h1>Gunarm (part 19 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../burstangel/index.html">Burst Angel</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sakuraz.html">Sakurazukamori6</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../burstangel/gunarm-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>There were ways to tell someone you loved them without having to 
actually resort to using words to do it. Words were incomplete most of 
the time. They only showed one side, one surface and not the 
multi-tiered chambers of a heart. The word love was something that 
confused, disorientated, elated, angered and saddened people. It was a 
word that had such strong connotations chained to it, that it gave the 
sense of only one option, one choice. That death and life were the 
balancers of the scale and nothing existed in the middle. No justice, no 
selflessness, no friendship...only love, love, love.

Jo was sitting on the couch.

She&#39;d been given a lot of time to think over this word and all the ways 
this one word could be expressed, and the more she thought about those 
expressions of love, the more she realized that she&#39;d already done all 
of them...twice. So what was there left for her to do, but say those 
three words?

&quot;I love you.&quot; She said out loud suddenly, testing them on her tongue 
like it would corrode away if she wasn&#39;t careful and didn&#39;t practice.

Meg had frozen in the doorway with a plate of curly fries held in her 
hand.

&quot;What?&quot;

Jo, realizing that she was no longer alone, turned back to face the 
front, after she had ascertained it was Meg by visual aid. She began to 
pick at her fingernails.

&quot;Jo...?&quot; Meg&#39;s feet pattered over the ground and the redhead was 
suddenly in front of her. A yearning look on her face, &quot;What did you 
just say?&quot;

Jo bit her thumbnail, because it was longer than the rest. She should 
clip it, but she couldn&#39;t find a nail clipper anywhere around the 
trailer, and filing them seemed to take too long. She looked up at the 
redhead in front of her, &quot;I was just practicing.&quot;

Meg put down the plate in her hand and sat next to the other girl. 
&quot;Practicing what?&quot;

&quot;Stuff.&quot; Jo said, and it was the first time Jo had ever spoken to her in 
such an indirect way, usually Jo&#39;s bluntness would have struck her 
upside the head right about now.

Meg laughed despite herself.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I had no idea that guy was your father?&quot; Meg said, as she curled up to 
Jo on the couch, cushions stacked around them and making their little 
nook even more comfortable. Jo sighed and rested her head against Meg&#39;s 
head.

&quot;I don&#39;t really have parents. They didn&#39;t give birth to me...they were 
just donors. I read about it. I&#39;m what&#39;d you call a test tube baby.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say it like that.&quot; Meg said, &quot;It sounds sad when you say it like 
that.&quot; Okay it was sad, but it didn&#39;t need to be anymore sadder than it 
already was. &quot;I think...well even if he&#39;s not really, you know, he still 
kind of...acted like one. I like him.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; Jo said absently and scratched her stomach, while yawning. 
&quot;I&#39;m tired.&quot; She said not waiting for an answer from Meg, but curling up 
against the redhead like a cat, resting her head on the girl&#39;s chest and 
nuzzling into her, as she prepared to take a nap.

&quot;JO!&quot; Meg screeched, feeling embarrassed, even though they&#39;d already 
done...stuff and this wasn&#39;t really anything that should get her so 
worked up. Jo cuddled into her again and closed her eyes.

&quot;I thought we were having a conversation.&quot; Meg said, and pouted. She 
really did want to know what Jo thought about...well those people. If 
this situation was bothering her at all, Meg was surely to lend an ear 
and a shoulder to cry on. Although she knew that would NEVER happen, as 
Jo was still nuzzling into her and dropping off to sleep.

&quot;No you don&#39;t!&quot; Meg shook her by the shoulder. &quot;C&#39;mon Jo. It&#39;s not good 
to hold stuff in like this. You should be more com-mu-ni-cative.&quot; Oh 
lookie she used a big word. Too bad she kind of stumbled over it. Ah 
well. &quot;I want to know what Jo&#39;s thinking right now.&quot;

&quot;Jo&#39;s thinking she needs to sleep,&quot; Jo said, while burying her head into 
her chest with a sigh. Meg stopped herself from shaking the other girl 
again, and stared at the lovely image that Jo painted. Her silvery hair 
tussled; her face slack in sleep and her mouth not pined up in a sneer 
or smirk. Jo really looked like an angel when she slept, that much Meg 
knew, even if she was a demon every other waking moment of her life. Jo 
was...special. Jo was different then other people and so it was only 
normal that she handled things much differently than your average...Joe 
shmoe. And in her own way she was handling this situation. Jo was 
usually very inactive after she got back from a gunfight. Meg thought it 
was because Jo would be physically tired after such an ordeal...but 
really it was something more. It was more like Jo was also 
rehabilitating not from any physical wounds, but the mental scars too. 
She might be hard boiled, but Jo still felt things. She might not 
recognize what they were, but they were there, under the edges and 
shields adolescent programming and her circumstances had provided her. 
Jo was tired because she was unaware of the toil such things took out of 
her psychologically. It was her time to regroup the information she was 
given, and to assess the mental damage, before she moved on again. Jo 
was kind of like a computer, rebooting its systems and detecting viruses 
within her, and wiping them out, even if she didn&#39;t know what those 
viruses contained. The way she did these things were almost mechanical, 
programmed, but the fact that they existed, and that she couldn&#39;t just 
run into battle again without this needed time, it was proof of her 
humanity. Jo was human, after all, even if she didn&#39;t think so.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;You&#39;re such a grump when you sleep so long. C&#39;mon, get up sleepy head.&quot; 
Meg had dragged Jo to her bedroom after a while of cuddling on the couch 
and was now shaking her awake. &quot;If you sleep too long you might never 
wake up again and I might have to call Kyouhei in here to give you a 
kiss.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Jo rolled onto her side and looked at her through her white 
bangs.

&quot;I can&#39;t give you a kiss. I&#39;m not a prince. I&#39;m a princess. Jo needs a 
prince to wake her up,&quot; Meg said teasingly and Jo closed her eyes 
against Meg&#39;s nonsense.

&quot;Just kiss me and call it even.&quot; Jo said, and planted herself on her 
back and closed her eyes, like she was indeed a princess waiting for 
prince charming.

&quot;So you&#39;re not getting up until I kiss you?&quot;

&quot;Screw prince charming.&quot; Jo said, her voice giving a hint of the smirk 
she wasn&#39;t showing, as she opened one eye in time to see Meg leaning 
down and kissing her. She wrapped her arms around Meg&#39;s neck as the 
other girl hovered over her.

Meg pulled away, her fingers brushing over her lips. &quot;You think we 
have...I mean everybody&#39;s in the living room and...&quot;

&quot;That never stopped you before.&quot; Jo said, sitting up, suddenly 
wide-awake.

Well Jo indeed had a point. It was Meg who initiated their first time. 
She didn&#39;t think she was ever truly shy about expressing things like 
this to Jo. She was secure enough in her feelings to know that she 
wanted the physical aspect of the relationship, wanted it and craved it 
for some time now. But after what had happened, that awkward, strange, 
beautiful, breath-taking night, the last night before all of this 
happened, it had saddened her to some degree at how much she felt for 
Jo, but how much Jo didn&#39;t seem to understand the emotion. Jo was loving 
with her, but was Jo truly in love with her. She felt like she was 
forcing her love on the other girl. However, that moment of strange 
embarrassment Jo had showed when she&#39;d walked in on her saying those 
words. Simple and sweet in that impossibly apathetic way Jo had about 
her. It&#39;d shocked her. It really did. She thought maybe Jo was reading 
something at first, but when she looked down, the other girl hadn&#39;t been 
holding anything in her hands. Neither, the thought slapped her in the 
back of the head at how obvious it was, Jo wasn&#39;t someone who really 
cared to read, and if she did on the of chance, then she surely wouldn&#39;t 
be reading something with the words &quot;I love you&quot; in print. So what was 
it? She&#39;d thought it was kind of funny. Jo saying those words out of the 
blue and here she was always thinking about those words all the time, 
wanting so much to hear those words. Irony could be a cruel thing. Could 
it be self-projection? Jo in her own way could be strangely perceptive 
to her moods, like some kind of wild animal. She did have good 
instincts. And again Jo was perceptive to the weirdness that she was 
throwing off with her reticence to be intimate. She was scared. Every 
time they were together she felt desperate. Like she&#39;d never let Jo go, 
even when everything was done, she just couldn&#39;t let the other girl go. 
It hurt too much. The physical aspect of their relationship only made 
her yearn more instead of quelling whatever was inside of her and she 
felt empty. Even after eating, it was like there was lead in her stomach 
and she felt heavy, but empty. Weighted down by impossible dreams and 
words that she would never truly receive.

&quot;Meg?&quot; Jo asked and scooted over to sit in front of her. &quot;Did...I not do 
it right?&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Meg said, brought out of her stupor by Jo suddenly not making any 
sense.

&quot;That night. I wanted to ask you.&quot; Jo pushed on with that cool head of 
hers. &quot;What I did...did it feel good?&quot;

Meg blushed. What the heck was Jo talking about? Of course it 
felt...well good. Jo was such a weirdo.

&quot;You&#39;re so weird.&quot; Meg said, even though she knew this wasn&#39;t the best 
way to answer this. It just came out.

Jo made a face at her.

&quot;It was...&quot; terrifyingly good, &quot;I liked it a lot.&quot; Oh good one. 
&quot;Jo...you shouldn&#39;t ask me questions like that. I mean you could tell I 
liked it...&quot; just by the sounds I was making, &quot;just by...&quot; she blushed 
again, &quot;This is stupid.&quot; Meg finally giving up scooted the extra way to 
put her in Jo&#39;s arms. She placed her hands, palm flat on the other 
girl&#39;s chest and pushed until Jo was on her back.

Jo looked up at her. &quot;I guess I need more practice.&quot; And the blandness 
in which she had said those words, totally threw her for a loop. More 
practice? Jo sounded like she was talking about riding a bike...or 
riding Django. Only Jo could turn sex into a competition and for some 
reason, the fact that the other girl wanted to get better at it, made 
Meg&#39;s head spin a little. Crap, did Jo want to kill her, 
because...well...if she got better then Meg knew she surely wouldn&#39;t be 
able to survive that.

&quot;I&#39;ll get better.&quot; Jo said again, like she had just fallen off her 
imaginary bike.

Meg opened her mouth to explain--slowly this time--to Jo that there was 
no need to get better as she particularly wanted to live, a healthy, 
long, credit-card friendly life. However Jo cut her off with a swift 
kiss and she almost bitten the other girl in surprise. Her hot mouth 
shifting, lips slightly stiff as Jo didn&#39;t really soften the kiss on 
contact only made it firmer, harder. She was a bit clumsy and she had to 
use her hands to move Meg&#39;s mouth to how she wanted it, tipping her chin 
back and letting her tongue slide in. Meg made a muffled sound, 
appreciative, but at the same time frustrated, as Jo seemed to not want 
her to breath.

Meg, pulling in air from her nose and tightening her arms around the 
other girl&#39;s shoulder leaned back and let gravity take control. They 
both fell to the mattress and Jo&#39;s immediate response was to place both 
her palms on either side of Meg, bracing her up, as she kissed the other 
girl. They stayed that way for a good amount of time, until Jo pressed 
down harder on top of her, shifting right between her legs, one of her 
knees sliding up the bed so she could kneel between Meg&#39;s legs and get 
the leeway to pull her T-shirt off, that same knee accidentally brushing 
against Meg&#39;s clit through her clothing and causing the other girl to 
mewl in pleasure. However Meg&#39;s visual sensory was also being 
stimulated, as Jo now shirtless and in her underwear--which was remedied 
moments later by Jo&#39;s deft fingers, her underwear now someone off to the 
side of the bed--leaned over her.

&quot;You&#39;re wearing too much clothes.&quot; Jo said, and Meg could feel her 
heartbeat quicken and something else that felt like irony buttering 
through her system. This was the first time anyone had ever told her she 
was wearing too much of...anything.

&quot;Well then fix me up then.&quot; Meg teased and raised her hands, wanting Jo 
to be the one to undress her, because Jo&#39;s fingers, for some reason, 
weren&#39;t shaking like hers. Were calm and steady and even though she 
didn&#39;t know what she was doing half the time, they were still sure of 
themselves. Jo didn&#39;t have any objections, as she began to pull Meg&#39;s 
tank top over her head. Jo looked at the lace bra she was wearing and 
then frowned.

&quot;You have to handle that.&quot; Jo said, because never once in her life did 
she wear a bra. She didn&#39;t feel she needed one, as hers, she thought 
were small enough to not get in the way, unlike Meg and Sei&#39;s, which got 
in the way all the time.

So while Meg was taking off her bra, Jo not deterred from moving on, 
slipped her fingers under the waistline of Meg&#39;s jeans and yanked them 
down, her movement swift and rough, without meaning to be. Then she 
pulled down Meg&#39;s underwear in the same fashion and threw it off the bed 
and to the floor.

Meg did the same thing to her bra, and in one extravagant toss they were 
both completely and utterly naked. Jo stared down at her and Meg stared 
up, but it was still so exciting and embarrassing when they looked at 
each other. She didn&#39;t ever think she&#39;d get used to seeing Jo naked, or 
Jo looking at her, like she was right now. With that curious, steady 
gaze that spoke of trust and intent.

Meg sweeping her palms up the other girl&#39;s sides, a tickling motion that 
made Jo squirm a little, but not in a bad way, laughed when she saw the 
cute, almost grumpy look on the girl&#39;s face at finding a weakness.

Jo leaned down and those pure, blood red eyes were staring at her now, 
like a cat, looking for the branch in which to lay down for the day, to 
scope prey out, to sleep and forget. Then Jo met her mouth timidly and 
it was such a contrast from before, she nipped at her bottom lip and 
still kept those amazing eyes open, lidded but with a subtle resolution 
burning within in them. Jo covered her mouth entirely with hers and Meg 
immediately responded, her hands going up to link around Jo&#39;s neck and 
pull the other girl flush, until she could feel Jo&#39;s nipples pressing 
into her own. One of her knees jumped up at the sudden delicious 
friction and it pressed between Jo&#39;s legs, the other girl&#39;s eyes 
widening for a split second before she moved experimentally against her 
thigh. Jo&#39;s eyes closed then, and her brow furrowed, like she was trying 
to concentrate on one thing and something else was getting at her. It 
was most likely the kiss, or the touch of sensitive nipples against 
bared skin. Jo swallowed around the kiss they were sharing and Meg 
passing her hands over Jo&#39;s shoulders felt the other girl jerk up.

&quot;Nggghh...uuhhh.&quot; Meg&#39;s knee was pressing more firmly against Jo&#39;s clit 
and the result had the other girl trying to keep herself balanced, as 
she braced her hands more firmly on the mattress. Meg watched on in 
delight as Jo, struggling with too much sensation, the gratifying sounds 
of her pleasure leaking out of her and being shared within the same 
kiss, had to close her own eyes and try not to pass out. Suddenly one of 
Jo&#39;s hands, like it had a mind of its own, clamped over her thigh, her 
fingers squeezing the soft flesh and causing a shock of pleasure to run 
its course up the sensitive area and pool inside her vagina. That hand 
slid up, not feathery soft, but solid and within a couple of heart 
rendering seconds, that hand with calloused fingers and soft palms had 
pressed into the warmth at her epicenter. Meg thrashed, despite herself 
and was delirious at how wet she was. Jo had hitched up on her again, 
was still slowly and thoroughly riding her thigh as her fingers began 
their ministrations. There were burning touches that scorched all the 
way inside and then soft, pressing caresses that lapped at the flames. 
Meg whimpered and Jo also trying to get at her own finish, continued to 
rub herself against Meg&#39;s warm, soft thigh. The pressure constricting 
her airway passages, her pored raised up in that similar tightness that 
seemed to affect her breathing.

Jo&#39;s fingers were deep inside of her, and with each added digit the 
pressure intensified. The white-haired girl&#39;s eyes shut tight against 
the pleasure blossoming in her own gut and the kisses they were still 
sharing. Now desperate and sweet like nectar. Jo quickened her pace, 
both her fingers and her lower body finding a tandem in which to ride 
out this taunt pleasure. The single breathe of gratification coursing 
through her and making her move even faster, coercing her, demanding of 
her to keep the friction between them and to let her finally have a 
release of the tension clinging to her nerve endings. Clinging to her 
soul, ever since Meg had been taken away from her and she had no way to 
quench the ache in her heart, in her fingers, in her mouth, until now.

Meg mindless with lust, moved her leg roughly against Jo, the other 
girl&#39;s palm brushing and burning sensation into her clitoris, the 
feeling building and raising like transient smoke and condemning them to 
move even faster and trap that haze between them, finally find release.

Jo was the first to orgasm, her body shaking like a leaf and her white 
bangs sticking to her like snow and icicles after they had melted. Meg 
came afterwards, with her legs sliding even more open and a panting 
breath being swallowed by Jo&#39;s still burgeoning mouth. The noises Meg 
made after, desperate and hoarse, as she came down from that 
unbelievable high making Jo groan in agreement.

&quot;I...Meg...&quot; Jo whispered, and she nearly fell on top of her when she 
tried to reorient herself. The arms bracing herself up now shaking with 
the aftermath of extreme pleasure and Meg thought that maybe it wasn&#39;t 
so bad to not receive those words, not when she was the only person in 
the world, who could see Jo like this, to see that tough exterior 
trembling and shaking in incoherency and beautiful honesty. She could 
live with the fact that those words...maybe didn&#39;t mean so much as the 
value she had placed on them, like a crown of jewels, the hollow fairy 
tale. She loved Jo and even though Jo had never spoken of it directly to 
her, this moment, this shared ecstasy, the feeling afterward, and Jo&#39;s 
actions and responses to her plight, were something more substantial. 
Something more that words couldn&#39;t capture as well.

&quot;Meg, am I getting better?&quot; Jo asked and she nuzzled into her, finally 
lowering herself on top of Meg and resting her head on her chest. Meg&#39;s 
legs now spreading and tangling with her own.

&quot;Jo&#39;s the best at everything she does.&quot; Meg answered back, and she 
kissed the top of her head and sighed at the upcoming wave of slumber 
rolling over her tired limbs. She slept like sleeping beauty poisoned 
after that and to her, it was the best sleep she had ever had.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Meg, putting her arm around Jo&#39;s shoulders pulled her in closer. Jo&#39;s 
breath was escaping across her collarbone and fanning some of her red 
hair. Meg closed her eyes and the sounds of Jo&#39;s even breathing gave her 
a calm that she didn&#39;t think anyone could ever give her. She felt at 
peace.

&quot;Meg...you smell like perfume.&quot; Jo bleary eyed looked up at her from her 
perch above her chest.

&quot;Oh, you like it. I put it on just for you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like it.&quot; Jo answered in that completely blunt, unsophisticated 
manner. &quot;It&#39;s too sweet. I could smell it when I was dreaming.&quot; Jo&#39;s 
head sagged to one side. &quot;My leg&#39;s asleep.&quot;

Meg rolled her eyes and wondered what dams of hell she&#39;d unleashed when 
it was Jo who was whining, but still in that nondescript voice. Jo&#39;s 
words also had caught her unaware.

&quot;You dream Jo?&quot; Jo never told her anything like that before.

Jo looked thoughtful for a moment, &quot;Sometimes, when I&#39;m comfortable.&quot;

&quot;So you dream about nice things when you sleep like that?&quot; Meg asked and 
smiled down at Jo, as she righted herself on the bed.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jo said. She scratched her elbow and looked to her right, like 
something had caught her eyes, even though there was nothing 
particularly interesting to look at in the room, with the exception of 
each other.

&quot;What do you dream about?&quot;

Jo looked at her when she asked this and then shrugged her shoulders. 
&quot;Sometimes...I dream about you.&quot;

End.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

A/n: Burst out into tears. Why am I such a damn sap? Sorry for taking so 
long to finish, but school is constantly tearing into my ass. Yes, it&#39;s 
taken out a big chunk. Oh that and other stories that I&#39;m working on. 
I&#39;d like to thank everyone that&#39;s stuck with this crazy thing and all 
those who have left reviews and words of wisdom. It&#39;s what got me 
through. For all those who are going WTF&#39; at Jo&#39;s not saying those 
&quot;special words&quot; I just thought, they were practically already said. Jo 
doesn&#39;t need to say them to Meg. Jo&#39;s just a different creature and she 
doesn&#39;t view those words as important, not to the actually feelings. 
Anyhoo, I had to end it with sex, because dammit I wanted a sex scene. 
These two need more lovin&#39; after all the violence. Again thanks for all 
those that stuck with this and its been a blast.</pre>
