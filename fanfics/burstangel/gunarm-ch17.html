<h1>Gunarm (part 17 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../burstangel/index.html">Burst Angel</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sakuraz.html">Sakurazukamori6</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../burstangel/gunarm-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Damn if she ever needed Django, right now would be as good a time as 
ever.

There were just too many enemies to clip away at with her guns and too 
many obstacles to climb over, literally.

There were just too many.

And Meg was inside that building.

She knew she was.

And she wasn&#39;t leaving here without Meg.

.......................................................................

Meg frowning at a certain spot on the ceiling, sighed loudly as she 
remembered that she had already counted that tile and it was there that 
she had lost her count.

This was stupid.

Giving up, she rolled over on her stomach and tried to go to sleep.

She couldn&#39;t fall asleep on her stomach, so she rolled over to her side, 
and when that didn&#39;t pan out too well, she rolled onto her back again.

She was met again with the same square tile that had made her lose 
count. &quot;Uhhh,&quot; she groaned and sat up on the stiff cot. Her bare feet 
touching the cold floor of her cell, as she peered out through the 
small, barred window that gave her hope.

A guard passed by.

So much for hope.

It was going onto two weeks. Two weeks in this hellhole with nothing to 
read, nothing to wear&#151;they had put her in a hospital gown, a hospital 
gown! For the love of fashion sense&#151;and they had fed her nothing but 
nasty, smushy food that she had thought only babies and severely injured 
people ate.

It was hell.

She still had hope though.

Jo was going to get her.

Jo would definitely come get her.

She hoped Jo would come get her!

It couldn&#39;t be much longer.

All she had to do was wait for Jo. Good ole&#39; dependable Jo, who was 
strong as a bull and tough like as a tank. Jo would get here and she 
would rescue her and they would ride off into the sunset and...

Eat pizza.

God she had a craving for pizza.

Pizza, and gum, and chips and every unhealthy, fried, battered greasy 
food she could get her hands on.

She was so hungry.

She was so damn hungry.

And she hadn&#39;t slept a good, decent sleep for days now.

God and she didn&#39;t even want to know what would happen if she got her 
period and she was still in this god-damned cell, with bad food, and bad 
sleeping arrangements and bad&#151;white&#151;clothing.

Would they give her tampons?

Or would they give her pads?

It boggled her how her thought processes worked these days.

It was probably from the lack of nutrition.

Oh god, this was worse than a diet.

She wondered for a second there if she was any skinnier.

And then for another stupid second, she wondered if they would provide 
her with a scale if she asked for one.

Wow. This was not the time to be thinking about if she could fit into 
those new jeans she bought three weeks ago.

Jo would like those jeans.

She wondered if she was skinny enough if Jo would notice and compliment 
her.

Dammit she wanted pizza!

Meg jumped from the loud noise of the guard thumping his nightstick 
against her cell door. &quot;You got a visitor missie. Betta behavior and no 
biting this time, you got me?&quot; The guard warned and he was opening the 
door and the doctor that she had bitten from last week was walking 
through the door.

&quot;Hello Meg.&quot; A woman with black hair and high heels walked into the 
padded room, her glasses catching the luminescent light from above and 
holding it for a second before she turned her head and regarded the tray 
that Meg had left on the floor.

&quot;You didn&#39;t touch your carrots.&quot;

&quot;I hate carrots.&quot; Meg grumped and she had a mind to bite the woman again 
for just suggesting the thought that she should eat something that she 
hated.

&quot;Well you should eat it. Your diet here is very balanced. You&#39;re also 
due for a check-up in about an hour, so you should get yourself ready.&quot; 
The woman said and adjusted her glasses.

Meg looked at her with a disbelieving look. &quot;Are you nuts? Get ready 
with what? You guys stick me in this room and then expect me to go along 
with your experiments like I&#39;m Frankenstein or something.&quot;

Meg was very close to biting this woman.

She wondered if she would taste like pizza.

She hoped so, because she was fucking hungry.

&quot;Please Meg. You&#39;ve been in contact with 013. We have to collect all the 
progressive data we can get before we start on the real thing.&quot; The 
doctor informed her and Meg didn&#39;t understand why this woman kept 
spouting the same nonsense over and over again, when she didn&#39;t 
understand what 013 was and what she had to do with it.

&quot;I&#39;m so sick of you people sticking needles in me and poking and 
prodding at me like a houseplant. You&#39;re so going to be sorry when Jo 
gets here.&quot;

There was an abrupt knock at the door and both occupants of the room 
looked at the tiny, glass rectangle that let them view the world outside 
of this cramped cell.

&quot;You got another visitor.&quot; The guard called out and soon the door was 
opening and someone else was being let in. It was another doctor, a 
doctor that had visited her even more than the lady doctor and Meg 
snorted as he walked in through the door, white squishy coat and black 
oxfords tapping against the linoleum floor.

&quot;Hello again.&quot; He said in his casual voice.

The lady doctor waved him over.

&quot;She&#39;s not eating her carrots.&quot; The woman said like it actually 
mattered.

&quot;Oh that&#39;s a shame.&quot; The male doctor said, and he was staring at her 
like it did matter.

These two were obviously senile.

They didn&#39;t look a day over thirty though.

But she figured that mentally, old age just caught up to some people 
much faster than others.

The male doctor had pulled out a clipboard from behind his back, as he 
flipped through a couple of pages and stopped to read something that had 
obviously caught his eye.

&quot;You&#39;re a normal human.&quot; He responded out of nowhere to her.

&quot;I already knew that.&quot; You moron! She was about to say, but she didn&#39;t 
know how they would take it and something about calling a scientist a 
moron didn&#39;t sit too right with her.

&quot;Yes, we did too. We were just being nosy.&quot;

Huh? God could they make less sense.

&quot;Anyhoo, isn&#39;t it time for your weekly checkup,&quot; the male doctor said, 
and he was reaching out his hand for her. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about 
a thing.&quot; He said to her and also to the female doctor, who was suddenly 
giving him a weary look, &quot;I&#39;ll take her down to the lab right now. You 
should get back to the Glenford. He&#39;ll be waiting.&quot; The man said, and 
Meg could even hear the sneer in his voice, even though she couldn&#39;t see 
it.

&quot;Fine.&quot; The female doctor said and she was watching them go, as the male 
doctor escorted Meg out of the room and into the dark hallway.

He turned to her and smiled.

She didn&#39;t smile back for obvious reasons.

He turned away to stare down the hallway and Meg who still had her eyes 
glued on the doctor, now afforded a side profile was almost startled by 
the weird resemblance he had to somebody.

She didn&#39;t know who exactly, but it was in the face and she just 
couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. There was something about his features...

He wasn&#39;t an ugly man...

If anything quite the opposite, but that wasn&#39;t what was getting to her.

It was his features and how those features looked so familiar, like the 
sharp jut of his jaw, or the thin, straight, aristocratic nose, or his 
eyes and how narrow they were. He didn&#39;t look Japanese. She was pretty 
sure he was white and his English wasn&#39;t accented. He spoke perfect 
English, but he could also speak Japanese fluently so maybe that wasn&#39;t 
such a good method to go by to determine what he was. The woman doctor 
was Japanese though, because her English still had accents that she 
could recognize. Meg could proudly say she spoke two languages, since 
she was originally from New York and when she had come to Japan, she&#39;d 
had to pick up fast or be unable to live, i.e. go out shopping, purchase 
yummy foods, and more importantly count money. Money was always money 
wherever you went.

She looked over back at the doctor, trying to place him in the context 
of her memories. Her eyes roved over his face again just to be sure that 
she hadn&#39;t missed anything and suddenly her eyes were drawn to his mouth 
and the small smile that was there. His thin lips crooked up in 
something that couldn&#39;t exactly be called a smile, the man looking all 
too pleased with himself.

Dammit, where has she seen this expression before?

She had already noticed the weird way he smiled and the equally weird 
way he spoke to her, a little too familiarly and with touch of sarcasm, 
like he was dealing with a child.

Rawrrrr. This was going to eat away at her.

&quot;Hey have we met before?&quot; Meg threw out, like they were old time friends 
and not some twisted relationship of prisoner and the doctor that 
supervised her.

The smirk had stretched at one corner and Meg could see the man had a 
certain bounce in his step. &quot;Maybe. Who knows?&quot; He said mysteriously and 
Meg had always hated having something on the tip of tongue, but unable 
to recall it or put the puzzle together.

The doctor&#39;s long legs cut a swift path down the corridor and Meg, 
trying to keep up realized that they weren&#39;t taking the normal route to 
the lab.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on?&quot; She said, very suspicious and ready to run.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; He said and his thin shoulders rose and dropped in a shrug, 
his lanky stature stopping in front of a certain door, as he seemed to 
be waiting for something.

&quot;Hey I duh know what you&#39;re trying to pull here, but I&#39;ve got a...&quot;

&quot;A Jo. Yes you do.&quot; The doctor said like he didn&#39;t have a care in the 
world and Meg couldn&#39;t help but freeze up in her spot. &quot;Oh and here she 
comes now.&quot; The doctor said again, his voice as casual as ever as he 
pointed behind her.

She didn&#39;t know what it was, but her body had frozen stiff and she 
couldn&#39;t move her legs as the doctor continued to point behind her. She 
didn&#39;t know if he was just playing with her, if he knew all about Jo and 
was just messing with her.

That wasn&#39;t nice.

Especially when she had so much hope that Jo would come rescue her and 
to have had to wait weeks was killing her.

If she turned around and Jo wasn&#39;t there...she didn&#39;t know what she 
would do...

&quot;Meg.&quot;

All her resistance seemed to melt with that one voice, that familiar, 
clear, beautiful voice and she was turning around without any conscious 
effort and starring into the face of the person she had been waiting 
for, for what felt like forever.

They were just staring at each like this was some kind of quicksand 
dream world and that world had affixed each to her spot.

&quot;Meg,&quot; Jo called out to her again, even reached out her hand like she 
didn&#39;t know what to do and Meg immediately was throwing herself into the 
arms that were thin and still solid and there.

&quot;JO!&quot; she sobbed and she didn&#39;t understand how this could be happening 
right now, not when she had been prepared to turn around and not meet 
anything but empty air and even emptier darkness. &quot;Jo.&quot; She squeezed 
tighter and she could feel arms squeezing her back, if even tighter. She 
closed her eyes and thought that if she died now, it would have all been 
worth it.

&quot;Ahem.&quot; The doctor cut in, not knowing how to tactfully pull them apart.

Jo was clinging to her and it almost felt like she was trembling.

Meg hugged her tighter and didn&#39;t think she would let go in this 
lifetime, didn&#39;t want to let go in this lifetime or any other.

&quot;I really hate to cut in like this,&quot; the doctor said again, his voice 
actually sounding apologetic, &quot;but you two should really leave.&quot; Jo 
suddenly had her hands on her and had abruptly pushed her away, but all 
the while still keeping her grip on the perch of her shoulders. Her 
fingers were digging into the fleshy skin there, where the hospital gown 
had done a poor job of covering up, the material of the glove cold 
compared to her warm skin.

&quot;Right.&quot; Jo said and she hadn&#39;t pulled her eyes away from Meg when she 
said this, only stared at her harder, like she was going to vanish if 
she blinked. She was also suddenly leaning into her.

&quot;Um.&quot; The doctor turned around. &quot;Don&#39;t mind me ladies.&quot; He said and Jo 
seemed to remember herself and pulled back.

She turned to look at the doctor, &quot;How are we going to get out of here? 
I can&#39;t come the same way I did.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you climbed all the way up here?&quot; The doctor asked, even 
though he had seen some pretty amazing things throughout his career 
working as a scientist for such top corporations and powerful leaders, 
it still amazed him how stubborn she was.

Meg knew they were high up, but she couldn&#39;t tell which floor.

Jo shrugged her shoulders, the motion completely contradictory to the 
way she was currently holding onto Meg&#39;s hand like it was her lifeline. 
In a way, he supposed it was.

&quot;Only the first 30 stories. I busted a window on the 31st floor. That 
reminds me, someone will probably notice that.&quot; Jo added, 
absentmindedly.

The doctor sighed and then he was removing his jacket and handing it to 
Jo. &quot;Here, you&#39;ll need this to get out.&quot;

Jo slipped it on and noticed the badge on the breast pocket.

&quot;You should tuck that away and use it only when you get down to the 
front entrance. Just keep your head down and swipe it in the keycard 
display and the door will let you out. The guards are sparse down there, 
so don&#39;t worry about it too much, especially at this time of the night. 
They&#39;re mostly guarding outside so you&#39;ll probably need to create a 
diversion to get past them, but I&#39;m confident you can do that, as you&#39;ve 
already snuck past them to get up here.&quot;

He was even handing over his pants and Meg had to look away when she 
realized what he was doing. She definitely knew something was not right 
with this guy, if he could so calmly strip down to his boxers in a 
hallway and hand over his clothes without a second thought.

He was handing over his glasses too and Jo looked through them, slipping 
them down onto her face and squinting. She looked a bit crossed eyed. 
Meg restrained the need to laugh, she also restrained the need to hug, 
because she felt so relieved and happy and stupid, just standing here in 
the drafty hallway with half her backside out&#151;thankfully she was wearing 
underwear&#151;and she just couldn&#39;t stop herself from grinning and leaning 
forward and playfully hitching the glasses up higher on Jo&#39;s nose.

&quot;You look cute.&quot; Meg commented smiling, ready to kiss Jo senseless and 
then she realized something. Or she recognized the striking similarity 
that Jo had to the doctor to the side of her, even more so with the lab 
coat and the glasses.

It was really...freaky.

&quot;I&#39;ll see you girls later,&quot; the doctor called back, funnily enough in 
his underwear and his undershirt as he walked down the hallway and left 
with a wave and not even a glance backwards.

&quot;Hey who was that guy?&quot; Meg asked curious as to what Jo has been up to 
when she was away.

&quot;Beats me.&quot; Jo answered back, already checking her weapons and walking 
down the hallway. Her one hand latching on Meg&#39;s arm and dragging her 
behind her at a reasonably fast pace. &quot;We don&#39;t have much time. They&#39;re 
probably going to notice soon that you&#39;re missing, so we have to hurry.&quot;
