<h1>Blossoming on the Battlefield</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../burstangel/index.html">Burst Angel</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tenchipachy.html">Tenchi-Pachy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>       Jo and Meg are seated together on their couch next to the window 
that provides them a view of the world, outside the oversized trailer 
that is their home. It is drawing close to evening. The sun does not 
beam onto them, but they can feel the calm warmth of the twilight 
coloring.
       They face opposite Sei, who takes her seat on the couch adjacent 
to them, with only the table dividing them their space. She has no desk 
for a more proper meeting, but this has always been the best they can do 
when called together for a symposium.
       &quot;What is it you wanted to tell us, Sei?&quot; Jo asked.
       Jo is naturally unassuming, willing to go with the flow of what 
Sei has to talk about, whether or not she finds it favorable. Meg is 
already anxious, expecting something really bad. There is always some 
kind of vibe that Sei gives, and the mood that she seems to be conveying 
right now is something serious indeed. The fact that Jo and herself were 
called together specifically for this is enough to prepare her. Sitting 
next to Jo is all it takes to ease her, if only somewhat.
       Sei closes her eyes and takes a sip of her tea. Then she opens 
her eyes. &quot;I acknowledge the two of you have always been together, long 
before I recruited you. Because of that, I acknowledge you have an 
inseparable bond.&quot;
       &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Meg said, hoping it did not sound so desperate.
       &quot;There will be no easy way for me to say this, so I&#39;ll just get 
to it,&quot; Sei said, placing her drink on the table between them, &quot;Jo, Meg, 
as your leader I will no longer have you work together side by side as 
partners in the field.&quot;
       The information does not hit Jo and Meg quite so sudden, for what 
their leader said had seemed entirely out of context from their daily 
life. Then Jo&#39;s eyes widen, fully registering what it all means. 
Although Meg does not look, she can feel the fire kindling within Jo&#39;s 
eyes. Sei can see them clearly, and maintains a cautious but composed 
stance.
       Jo shoots up off the couch, having been sitting next to Meg 
opposite from the window, and stands stiff upon her legs at the end of 
the table. Her fists clench, her teeth bare and grit, her eyes dig into 
those of Sei who sits below her, giving the impression that she is at 
Jo&#39;s mercy. To see Jo as a raging beast on the job was one thing, but 
seeing Jo&#39;s behavior like this close to home proves to Meg that 
everything is gradually falling apart around her.
       &quot;What do you mean we can&#39;t be partners anymore?!&quot; Jo yelled out. 
It is obvious to the two other women that Jo is using everything to 
restrain herself.
       &quot;You misunderstand, Jo,&quot; Sei said, &quot;Meg will still be working for 
us. She can provide herself as your backup if a situation were to call 
for it-&quot;
       &quot;But why will she not be my partner anymore?!&quot;
       Sei takes a breath before continuing. &quot;I have turned a blind eye 
for a while, but Meg really hasn&#39;t proven herself useful as your field 
partner. She has always gotten herself caught, and as her friend you 
feel it is your highest priority to protect and rescue her, even at the 
expense of my orders, your missions, and even your other teammates. I 
cannot ignore or tolerate it anymore, Jo. Meg cannot work with you 
anymore. I feel it in our team&#39;s best interest for you to work solo. 
That way your efficiency will be ensured the entire time.&quot;
       Jo slams the palms of her hands on the table, her fiery eyes 
digging further into that of the calm, fortified Sei. &quot;You can&#39;t do 
this! I won&#39;t let you!&quot;
       &quot;You are in no position to speak to me that way,&quot; Sei said, 
slightly raising her voice, &quot;It&#39;s an *order*, Jo! As a mercenary working 
in my squad, you will help me in maintaining trust between us, and you 
will accept my judgment. It is for the greater good, Jo, I ask that you 
understand that.&quot;
       Jo responds with nothing more than her penetrating, menacing 
glare, then she instantly jerks her face toward Meg. Her fury ebbs as 
she gazes upon the visage of her longtime partner, silhouetted by the 
twilight penetrating through the window behind her, but not completely. 
&quot;Meg! Say something! Do you agree with her?! Do you want to stop working 
with me?! Do you?!&quot;
       All Meg can think of doing is look down at the table in front of 
her as her beloved friend finally confronts her. There is no easy way 
out of this. &quot;But Jo, Sei is right. I&#39;m always getting caught, and 
you&#39;re always rescuing me. Maybe it&#39;s time we faced the truth-&quot;
       &quot;We can change that!&quot; Jo said, &quot;We&#39;ll always be more careful from 
now on. I&#39;ve always protected you, Meg, and one way or another we always 
finished our jobs! You know that! Meg!&quot;
       The pressure and hopelessness of the situation consume Meg, 
becoming too much for her. The tears pour out without mercy. She covers 
her face, resting her head on the table, drowning out all sounds and 
people&#39;s voices with her sobs. It gives her the only sense that the 
world cannot disturb her.
       Jo helplessly watches her closest friend break down. Having Meg 
kidnapped was enough to make Jo feel like the world was ending. She had 
always been able to rescue Meg at last, and it always felt like the 
world was born anew. She had always protected Meg, but now Jo has never 
felt so helpless even though they are right next to each other. The fire 
within her extinguishes. There is nothing she can do or say to fix 
anything now, nothing to fight or triumph against.
       She looks to Sei, and reads subtle empathy in her eyes.
       Sei stands up straight, facing Jo directly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Jo, and 
Meg, but that&#39;s my final decision. It&#39;ll take a while for all of us to 
adjust, but that&#39;s the way it is. Excuse me.&quot; Sei takes her leave out of 
the trailer&#39;s cabin.
       Jo looks back at the sobbing form of Meg. She wants to accuse Meg 
of betraying her, and ask her why she did not fight for them, but it 
would only make everything worse. What is done is done, nothing can be 
changed. Instead of anger, Jo looks upon Meg with sympathy, and even a 
longing instinct to comfort her. They are so close that Jo can reach out 
and hold Meg. She musters no strength to do so; she is too confused from 
everything. These feelings wrench her inner gut. It is strange to her, 
and she does not like it.
       Very slowly, Meg is lifting her head off the table, and pulling 
her face from behind her hands.
       Jo does not want to look at what eyes come uncovered. She would 
never know what to say or how to handle everything with Meg. Jo is an 
invincible warrior, but if she is incapable of doing anything, then she 
cannot be around at all.
       She turns and speeds out of the room.
       Meg catches Jo right when she turns her back and departs, but she 
does not know what to say to stop Jo in her tracks. Meg had never felt 
so pathetic in her life. They were always there for each other, and yet 
she did not have the impetus to do or say anything to support Jo when 
she needed her. It strongly reflects to Meg of what kind of partner she 
really was to Jo on the field, seeming to prove everything that Sei had 
said about her.
       Meg must talk to Jo, and work everything out with her. They have 
been through too much together in life; she could not have everything 
fall apart they way they are about to. It is the least she can do at 
all.
       She forces herself off away from the table.
       -----
       Meg knocks on the bedroom door.
       &quot;Jo?&quot; Hearing no answer, she says, &quot;I&#39;m coming in, Jo.&quot;
       Meg opens the door to find her friend lying flat on her back atop 
the bed, her appendages sprawled outward. The twilight seems to radiate 
the most as it penetrates through the blinds of the single bedroom 
window. The light seems to hold down Jo in a state of dormancy as her 
eyes stare blankly up at the ceiling.
       It makes Meg feel even worse what her lack of support had done to 
Jo&#39;s very soul. Nonetheless, she slowly walks up and, upon receiving no 
response from Jo, sits down atop the bed next to her.
       &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Meg said, &quot;I should&#39;ve said something, when you 
needed me the most. You&#39;ve always been important to me, Jo, that has 
never changed and it never will. I can&#39;t believe how weak I am.&quot;
       Meg catches Jo give a subtle, silent side-glance.
       &quot;Please, Jo, say something.&quot;
       Jo takes a breath. &quot;I&#39;m tired. I never get tired, but that&#39;s what 
I&#39;m feeling right now.&quot; She looks straight at Meg. &quot;Maybe you didn&#39;t 
always do much, but when you were always by my side, I never felt alone. 
It reminded me I had a reason to fight and fulfill my directive as a 
mercenary. Without you there with me, I&#39;m going to feel very alone. I&#39;m 
bound to feel lost in an isolated world, where coming home to you will 
feel like the only real thing in my life. Don&#39;t ever call yourself weak, 
Meg, or else you will stay that way. You&#39;ll change, and that will show 
Sei for sure.&quot;
       &quot;You really believe that?&quot;
       &quot;I do. I see it in you, Meg. It just needs to be drawn out. But I 
guess we&#39;re just going to have to be patient for a while.&quot;
       Jo&#39;s words enwrap Meg&#39;s very being like music. When Jo is 
praising her or complimenting her, Meg feels as if she could lose 
herself entirely in a dreamy haze. It is an experience she never 
consciously wishes for, but when it comes she embraces it.
       Has she always felt this way with Jo? Due to the life that they 
lived together, she never gave herself time to think about it. Either 
that, or for as long as they had been working as Sei&#39;s mercenaries, her 
memories of what they were like together alone just became vague over 
time.
       Time itself seems to stand still as they are isolated in this 
very room of secure comfort, away from the rest of the world where they 
faced rules and regulations. Even their missions were governed by said 
rules and regulations. The warm light of the room blazes away everything 
else but themselves.
       All Meg knows is that she wants to be closer to Jo, right now.
       Meg grasps Jo&#39;s hand. It feels strapping, but warm all the same. 
Jo grips Meg&#39;s softer hand in reply, offering a subtle smile along with 
it. Meg feels the gravity of Jo&#39;s being pulling her in. Jo had always 
been a masculine girl, but in Meg&#39;s eyes she is the most beautiful woman 
in the world that only she can appreciate. Meg wants to be closer.
       Meg rests her body right next to that of Jo&#39;s. She can feel their 
very auras emanating off of each other. This is just not satisfying 
enough.
       Meg shifts her body even closer to that of Jo&#39;s. Almost 
unconsciously, Meg plants herself right on top of her. Her arms and legs 
enwrap Jo&#39;s body. Greater warmth is shared between both girls, almost 
encapsulating their bodies as one. This, Meg thought, is what feeling 
safe is all about.
       Her one hand feels down Jo&#39;s front, coming to a stop on her bare 
stomach, near the navel in the center. Jo had always used the excuse 
that she fights in what little apparel she wears for greater ease in 
movement, but Meg had always felt otherwise. It was nothing more than a 
lame pretext to show skin; Jo wears what she wears for the purpose of 
teasing Meg. The navel in clear view seemed to always scream to grab 
Meg&#39;s attention, taunting her. It took their work lives to distract Meg 
from losing herself to her captivation.
       She presses her palm against Jo&#39;s belly, taking in both the 
muscle tone and the softness. The tears come from nowhere, but they are 
in kinder, quieter, smaller doses than what she relieved back in the 
cabin. Meg does not understand why this still dissatisfies her. How much 
closer to Jo can she possibly be?
       Meg lifts her head to face Jo. She feels at her most weakest in 
doing this, but she pleads to her, *Please help me stop this pain inside 
me!*
       Jo&#39;s expression rarely ever changes, but all Meg ever had to do 
was look deep into her eyes. Through those windows alone, Jo is able to 
let Meg know when she is upset, angry, understanding, confused, as well 
as happy. Now Jo is studying her, calculating how it is she should 
respond.
       After what feels like an eternity of sinking into hell, Jo pushes 
her arms back beneath herself. She lifts her head, softly planting her 
lips onto that of Meg&#39;s. The eyes of both people involved close. 
Although Jo never before had the experience, she is able to ensnare Meg 
into the moment.
       The kiss finishes itself after another eternity, one that did not 
feel like hell. Meg instantly opens her eyes and gasps. They both stare 
at each other, neither taking another step in continuing or 
discontinuing. Everything hangs in midair. Meg never expected this.
       Jo sighs. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Meg, I thought that&#39;s what you wanted from 
me. I&#39;ve seen a couple movies before, and I thought that&#39;s what you do 
in a situation like this. Let&#39;s forget it happened.&quot;
       For a split second, Meg believes that Jo is telling the truth. 
They could stop everything right here and now, and put it all behind 
them. But no, she does not want that to happen. If she did, she was 
never going to have another chance, time or place to experience it 
again. Meg was crossing boundaries to Jo, but she did not think or was 
too afraid to go the whole way. It was Jo who once again took the great 
leap for her, to save her. This is what she wanted, this is as close as 
they possibly can get. She does not want it to stop.
       &quot;No!&quot;
       Meg instantly cups Jo&#39;s cheeks, ensuring that no force of nature 
will ever steal her away, and surrenders Jo to her own kiss. When that 
is over, she looks at Jo in the eyes, praying for more than anything 
else in the world for her to comply. Jo does; she kisses Meg in return.
       Everything else that happens afterwards is consciously lost to 
them. Their innermost mutual desires overtake them, engulfing the room 
into an atmosphere of its own. They do not think; they only move with 
the flow that they create as clothes are tossed and the warmth of nude 
flesh press against and gyrate together, leaving nothing to dry.
       -----
       As they come to awareness, they find themselves naked in each 
other&#39;s arms, with no sheets covering them. Morning light reaches them, 
giving the sense of entry to a world after birth. The mattress beneath 
them has yet to dry from all the fluids that were relieved, making the 
bed feel moist all over their bodies and give off an aromatic smell. The 
said fluids remain apparent between and down each other&#39;s legs, across 
their fronts, spread on their fingers and the lower halves of their 
faces. Their hair is all dried and tangled from the heat they exuded. 
They pant to uphold themselves as they look into each other&#39;s eyes. Meg 
feels as if she had inherited all the fire that Jo was made up of.
       Then Jo notices how much she is panting, how her body is 
shivering. She pulls back the hand she had wrapped around Meg, and 
watches it shiver unsteadily before her, covered in the solution that is 
alien to her. Jo&#39;s eyes widen in confusion, and, much to Meg&#39;s dismay, 
panic.
       &quot;I&#39;m trembling,&quot; Jo said, &quot;I&#39;m trembling.&quot;
       Just like that, the tears rupture from Jo&#39;s eyes, a feat she 
never made before in her life. This is enough of a surprise to Meg, even 
though she had always felt the emotion was there, silent, the one thing 
that kept Jo as a human being in Meg&#39;s eyes.
       Jo shuts her eyes and shakes her head violently. Even though she 
started it all, she had never expected something like this to happen in 
the end. &quot;No, I can&#39;t feel this way. This is wrong! I can&#39;t be here!&quot;
       Before Jo has the chance to push herself away from Meg, Meg takes 
action and hugs Jo hard to prevent her escape. She manages to pin Jo 
flat on the bed, their bodies lying on their sides next to each other. 
Jo is far physically stronger than Meg; if she wanted to she could have 
wrestled her way out of Meg&#39;s grip. But there is no way Jo would ever 
risk hurting Meg.
       &quot;Let me go, Meg!&quot;
       &quot;No! Don&#39;t run away from me, Jo, please!&quot;
       Jo stops attempting to push Meg away, but does not surrender 
herself either.
       &quot;This isn&#39;t me, Meg,&quot; Jo said as the tears cloud her eyes, &quot;We 
shouldn&#39;t have done this!&quot;
       &quot;Don&#39;t ever say that again! Please, don&#39;t be afraid of me. It&#39;s 
me, Meg, I&#39;m right here! I love you, Jo!&quot;
       Jo fights hard to restrain her sobs, but fails. She tries to push 
herself out of Meg&#39;s embrace again, but no avail.
       &quot;I love you, Jo,&quot; Meg said again, as if those words alone will 
subdue Jo from leaving, &quot;I love you, I love you-&quot;
       &quot;Stop saying that!&quot; Jo said, pleadingly.
       &quot;I won&#39;t stop,&quot; Meg said, &quot;Do you love me?&quot;
       Silence.
       &quot;Do you love me, Jo?&quot;
       &quot;Meg, I can&#39;t...we can&#39;t...&quot;
       &quot;Say that you love me, Jo.&quot;
       &quot;Meg, please, don&#39;t-&quot;
       &quot;Say that you love me, Jo! Say it!&quot;
       &quot;I love you!&quot; Jo blurted, &quot;I love you...I love you...I love 
you...&quot;
       In repeating those same three words, Jo finally drops all 
resistance and lets Meg enwrap her in her nude embrace. Jo has never 
felt so helpless ever as her sobs emit. Meg pets Jo&#39;s hair, coos, and 
plants kisses all over her face. After a while the sobs subside, but the 
tears still pour.
       Meg does not cry at all, which amazes herself even. Deep down, 
she realizes that she must be the strong one out of the two of them.
       Meg finally faces Jo squarely in the eyes. &quot;How do you feel, now 
that you&#39;ve said what you&#39;ve said?&quot;
       Jo feels she is at Meg&#39;s mercy now that she has left herself 
completely vulnerable to her. The only rational thing to do is comply to 
answering Meg&#39;s question. With sincerity, she says, &quot;I feel relieved. I 
feel free in a way like never before. I feel more open, like anything 
can come to get me at any moment, and there would be nothing I can do. I 
don&#39;t know how I feel about it at all. I&#39;m scared, Meg.&quot;
       &quot;This is what happens when lovers let go of all their boundaries 
to be close to each other,&quot; Meg said, &quot;Even though I may not show it, 
I&#39;m scared too, Jo. But at the same time, I have never felt so happy, 
ever. I&#39;ve always wanted to be one with you in some way; it&#39;s been 
eating me up this whole time. And then you gave me the most valuable 
thing in the world last night, and you&#39;re still giving it to me right 
now.&quot;
       Jo&#39;s eyes look deep into Meg&#39;s, but she says nothing.
       &quot;You&#39;ve always protected me, Jo, but this time I will protect 
you. If you ever feel scared, if you ever feel uncertain, if you need 
help in any way, just come to me. I would do everything I can, and I 
will comfort you.&quot;
       Meg pushes Jo&#39;s head in to rest against her bare ample bosom. 
Jo&#39;s breath quickens at the contact. Their previous sexual activity had 
been a blur, and so her body tingles all over from the feeling of Meg&#39;s 
nipples pointing into her very skin. &quot;Feel my breasts, Jo. Don&#39;t they 
feel soft and warm to you? Don&#39;t you feel safe this way?&quot;
       Jo&#39;s arms enwrap Meg. Their bodies intertwine as one.
       &quot;Yes,&quot; Jo said with a weakened voice, &quot;They do, your whole body 
does. Does my body feel the same way to you, even though I have 
muscles?&quot;
       &quot;Of course it feels the same way,&quot; Meg said.
       &quot;Then we can never go back to the friendship we once had,&quot; Jo 
said, &quot;You are truly an angel that has guided me out of hellfire. This 
can never end, that can never be an option!&quot;
       &quot;It doesn&#39;t ever have to be,&quot; Meg said, &quot;Let&#39;s meet like this, 
every night, and I promise you&#39;ll really get used to it. Since we&#39;ve 
come to this point, who knows how much farther we could go together?&quot;
       Meg&#39;s last question is answered with gentle snores. Jo had 
instantly fallen asleep from their night-long lovemaking and the 
stressful exhaustion from just moments before. Meg can see the serenity 
in Jo&#39;s sleeping face as it is nestled against her supple breasts.
       Meg keeps her arms around Jo&#39;s sleeping form.
       -----
       Jo and Meg never agree to come out to everyone and reveal their 
newfound bond, or to keep it a secret. They merely wait in their embrace 
until they mutually decide it is time to face the new day, and finally 
phase out of their moment.
       They dress themselves back up in their trademark attire and walk 
out into the cabin where their breakfast is being made ready by the 
team&#39;s faithful chef, Kyo. They behave their most casual as the rest of 
the gang, including Sei and Amy, the child prodigy, take their seats 
with them.
       Sei studies them, before offering a friendly smile. &quot;Are you both 
doing well?&quot;
       Meg nods and says, &quot;Yeah.&quot;
       &quot;Last night wasn&#39;t anything personal,&quot; Sei said, &quot;Believe me when 
I say you two mean a lot more to me than that.&quot;
       &quot;We understand, Sei,&quot; Jo said.
       &quot;Good,&quot; Sei said, &quot;I have here your new mission, Jo.&quot; With that, 
Sei lays out the priorities and objectives.
       Jo nods in acknowledgement to everything. She then exchanges a 
glance with Meg, who sends the silent message; I&#39;ll be waiting for you.
       -----
       &quot;Jo, what the hell happened out there?!&quot; Sei shouted.
       It is twilight evening again when Jo returned from her mission. 
Whatever had happened, Meg knew it could not be good due to Sei&#39;s 
disposition. Meg was instructed by Sei to stay out of the meeting, but 
Jo is too much a part of herself for Meg to comply. She resorts to 
hiding behind a wall next to the open door to the cabin, where Jo and 
Sei stand face to face in the middle of the room, so Meg remains in 
earshot. She risks a couple peeks, and even in split moments could see 
the shame in Jo&#39;s eyes.
       &quot;Answer me, Jo. What happened? I&#39;ve watched you in action through 
Amy&#39;s satellite monitors, and I&#39;ve never seen you this incompetent! Your 
aim with your guns was way off 80% of the time, you didn&#39;t seem to know 
where you were running to; your coordination was just fowled up all in 
all. If I hadn&#39;t come in to provide you aid, you would never have made 
it!&quot;
       Jo does not answer, and instead her eyes wander to the floor.
       &quot;Are you doing this on purpose?!&quot; Sei asked, &quot;Are you trying to 
get back at me for separating you from Meg? If that&#39;s the case, then 
you&#39;re no better than a child crying to her-&quot;
       &quot;That&#39;s not true at all!&quot; Meg cried out.
       Sei and Jo turn to see Meg standing firm in the open doorway 
before rushing over to Jo&#39;s side.
       &quot;Meg, stay out of this!&quot; Jo said.
       &quot;No, Jo!&quot; Meg said, embracing Jo&#39;s arm, &quot;I can at least do this 
much. I told you that I would protect you too, remember?&quot;
       Jo opens his mouth to retort, but nothing comes out. Although Meg 
may not consciously realize it, she is stronger than she thinks, strong 
enough to know how to put Jo in her place. She can feel Meg&#39;s spirit 
emanate through her own; a result of their night together that is not 
bound to be their last. Jo takes a breath, faces Sei, giving Meg the 
chance to speak.
       Sei, very much intent on getting to the bottom of everything, 
says, &quot;Well, how do you explain this?&quot;
       &quot;I spent a night alone with Jo,&quot; Meg said, &quot;We&#39;ve confessed our 
love, and we connected like never before. Her lack of coordination on 
the job may have been a result of it, and for that I take full 
responsibility.&quot;
       &quot;No you won&#39;t,&quot; Jo said, &quot;I was as much part of it. I let 
everything get to me, I let everything change me, and screw me up from 
who I normally was. I apologize for my recent failure as a mercenary, 
but I have no regrets at all what I did with Meg.&quot;
       &quot;Jo,&quot; Meg said. To herself, she thinks, *I&#39;m so proud of you, 
Jo.*
       Sei&#39;s expression of firmness practically freezes. It seems as if 
no thought is capable of crossing her mind. After a long awkward 
silence, Sei lets down her stance. &quot;You two are lovers now?&quot;
       &quot;I believe we&#39;ve always been lovers,&quot; Meg said, &quot;I just never had 
the courage to admit and express it.&quot;
       &quot;And I never had the understanding to acknowledge it,&quot; Jo said.
       Sei places her hand onto her forehead, as if massaging the 
information through her mind. Then she chortles, which leads to a whole 
sequence of giggles.
       Jo and Meg look at each other. They both know that Sei&#39;s laughing 
will not entail anything serious, not anymore. Jo smiles, deciding to 
take everything with ease. She then turns to Sei and politely asks, 
&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;
       As soon as Sei regains her composure, she says, &quot;I made the big 
decision of separating you yesterday out of the good for our team. You 
go to each other for comfort after that. It&#39;s the dumbest irony, but now 
I feel I have no choice but to put you back together. As lovers it seems 
the only way for Jo to perform efficiently again is to have her 
&#39;partner&#39; by her side. Only then she can she function properly.&quot;
       Jo&#39;s eyes widen. Meg gasps hard, covering her mouth, and then 
embraces Jo hard, knocking the both of them onto the floor, where they 
remain lying together. Jo silently hugs her back, loving this very thing 
that is making her feel most alive.
       &quot;Unless a last-minute job arrives later tonight, expect a big day 
tomorrow,&quot; Sei said, &quot;Meg, all I ask is that you really attempt to pull 
your act together. And Jo, as much as you love her, please respect the 
team, its principles, and mind the mission too.&quot;
       &quot;No problem,&quot; Jo and Meg said simultaneously.
       Sei takes her leave, but does not leave before hearing the three 
words &quot;I love you&quot; exchanged between Jo and Meg behind her. She feels 
very happy for them, which in turn makes her feel very happy for 
herself.
       -----
       The next day, Jo and Meg leave on their new mission together. Sei 
and Amy sit together in the trailer&#39;s cockpit watching them on Amy&#39;s 
satellite computer. They witness Jo and Meg wind up in their usual 
situations. Meg gets caught as usual, but Jo arrives to save her with 
ferocity. Meg in turn takes action in covering Jo&#39;s back, and both work 
their way in accomplishing their objective.
       &quot;They&#39;re doing much better than usual,&quot; Amy said.
       &quot;Yes they are,&quot; Sei said, &quot;I&#39;m very glad they pulled through.&quot;
       &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to eavesdrop,&quot; Amy said, &quot;But through my computer 
frequencies I overheard what you were talking about with them. Is it 
true they&#39;re really in love with each other?&quot;
       &quot;Apparently yes.&quot;
       &quot;That really came as a surprise for you, didn&#39;t it?&quot;
       &quot;To be honest,&quot; Sei said, &quot;When I first recruited them, I got the 
vaguest feeling that I was dealing with lesbians. When I had them join 
the team, I placed rules and restrictions on them. They must&#39;ve felt 
like there was no place for them to have a relationship, even though I 
never frankly told them that it would be inappropriate.&quot;
       &quot;Wow,&quot; Amy said, &quot;Meg did well in fooling me, the way she always 
seemed to obsess over hunky men and give me a hard time about it.&quot;
       &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s more complicated than that,&quot; Sei said, &quot;Perhaps 
because they believed they couldn&#39;t have their relationship, aside from 
being a mercenary, Meg felt she was expected to act like a normal girl. 
Normal girls would idolize handsome men, even though deep down they 
really don&#39;t excite Meg. Her whooping and gasping for them never looked 
convincing to me, to be honest. It may be because all these men 
indirectly reminded her of Jo in some way.&quot;
       &quot;Well, Jo is kind of manly,&quot; Amy said, snickering.
       &quot;In a sense, but she&#39;s still a beautiful Amazon girl, especially 
in Meg&#39;s eyes. Now they share the same soul, they will never be able to 
survive without each other.&quot;
       &quot;Is that really what love does?&quot;
       &quot;I admit I&#39;ve never fallen in love,&quot; Sei said, &quot;But I know for a 
fact that&#39;s what happens. It may make you weaker, but it also makes you 
stronger too. It&#39;s like a war zone in of itself. What do you think, 
Kyo?&quot;
       A pathetic gasp is heard from behind, surprising Amy but not Sei. 
They turn to see their chef, Kyo, standing at the doorway.
       &quot;I&#39;m...I&#39;m s-sorry,&quot; Kyo said, &quot;I was going to double-check with 
you on something, then I overheard-&quot;
       &quot;It&#39;s alright, Kyo,&quot; Sei said, &quot;You&#39;re part of our family, after 
all. But if you don&#39;t mind me asking, don&#39;t you have a special someone 
in your life? Someone you think about? Maybe at school?&quot;
       Kyo, naturally, is taken aback by the prodding that had hit its 
mark. He looks down at the floor, scratching the back of his head, 
carefully choosing his words. &quot;Sort of.&quot;
       &quot;Well,&quot; Sei said, &quot;If you do, don&#39;t hesitate on it. Jo and Meg 
had kept themselves away from each other all this time, and now they 
can&#39;t keep their hands off each other. If you act sooner, you won&#39;t be 
feeling so much like an idiot for not having done so prior. Love is an 
adventurous world of its own; Jo and Meg are proof of that.&quot;
       Kyo continues rubbing the back of his head. Amy half-expects him 
to tell her to mind her own business and not act like his mother. 
Instead he attempts a feeble smile. &quot;I&#39;ll think about it. Are Jo and Meg 
really together?&quot;
       Sei nods, and Kyo blushes.
       &quot;Well, don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get in on any action, you 
dirty boy!&quot; Amy said, snickering some more.
       &quot;Let him be, Amy,&quot; Sei said, &quot;Now, Kyo, about dinner tonight. 
Please prepare a special feast for Jo and Meg when they arrive home, for 
a job well done.&quot; To herself, she thinks, *And for finally discovering 
each other.*
       Kyo gives his polite nod. &quot;No problem.&quot; Then he departs.
       Sei turns back to the monitor to continue watching Jo and Meg on 
the job, who are still performing efficiently.
       &quot;Kyo will bloom eventually,&quot; Sei said, &quot;We all do in our own 
time, when everything is just right for each of us. Jo and Meg have 
certainly found their time. They have shown that eventually we can all 
triumph.&quot;
       
       AUTHOR&#39;S NOTES 
       I hope you enjoyed this fanfic; feel free to send any questions 
or comments. I&#39;m bound to be around for a while, so if you read this in 
2008 my e-mail address will likely still be around to receive your 
feedback
       Before I watched Burst Angel on DVD, I bought the import manga 
online, which was supposed to be a prequel storyline to the anime. Even 
though I couldn&#39;t read it, it was painfully obvious that Jo and Meg were 
a couple, or at least Meg&#39;s feelings for Jo were most overt, while Jo 
didn&#39;t seem to quite know how to respond (Meg fantasizes them having 
sex, and drools from it). It surprised me somewhat that that 
lovey-doveyness is almost absent in the anime. If both the manga and 
anime are the same continuity, then what happened with Meg that she 
isn&#39;t pining for Jo so much and seems presumably straight in the anime?
       The conversation between Sei and Amy is a reflection of my views 
that provide the most sufficient explanations that I can think of. It&#39;s 
possible that Meg felt that working in a team would have rendered her 
relationship with Jo inappropriate, and she acted straight simply 
because she thought everyone, Amy especially, expected that of her. Time 
passes by and Meg just doesn&#39;t think about her original feelings 
anymore.
       Even though it may not be entirely noticeable, I think Meg&#39;s 
feelings for Jo are still there in the anime. It&#39;s most evident when Meg 
leans against Jo the way she does in the swimsuit episode, as they makes 
some confessions. She even seems to absorb the moment (blushing and 
everything) when she kisses Jo on the cheek in the final episode, saying 
that they should be able to live with just each other from there on. 
That way they could go back to the way they were before they were 
recruited, such as how they were in the manga.
       Meg&#39;s sexuality seem to show itself in other ways only if you 
take the time to study it. In episode 9, where the gang is invited to 
the Chinese party of Sei&#39;s family, Meg catches sight of a handsome guy, 
who happens to have long, grayish hair, the same kind of hairstyle as 
someone else that Meg knows close to her. When Meg was infiltrating the 
school in episodes 5 and 6, that girl who said Meg&#39;s hand &quot;felt warm&quot; 
also bears some resemblance to Jo, and it should be noted that Meg was 
blushing at the contact. This intimacy with another girl happens again 
toward the end of the anime, when Maria physically comes onto Meg. If 
Meg were totally straight, surely she would have been more appalled and 
put up more resistance to Maria&#39;s advance?
       Were there bedrooms in the trailer? I don&#39;t know; I contemplated 
Jo and Meg making love outside, but it didn&#39;t compare to the image of 
being secluded from the world in a room atop a comfortable bed, so I 
decided to ignore whether or not there really were bedrooms in the 
trailer and write them into this fanfic. In case you were wondering why 
I didn&#39;t write out their sex in detail, it just isn&#39;t my thing to 
describe an explicit sex scene, even though I categorized this fanfic as 
a lemon. It&#39;s my personal preference to write some things in detail and 
leave other things to the imagination.
       At Otakon 2006, I had the fortune of meeting Monica Rial, the 
English dub actress of Jo (and a ridiculously nice person in real life). 
I asked her about the OVA. She was polite enough to tell me that she 
couldn&#39;t reveal anything (not even an estimated release date), but 
confirmed that she&#39;s definitely attached, and that the OVA is going to 
come to America. How cool is that?! I know I can barely wait. From what 
I&#39;ve heard, it might be an adaptation of the prequel manga, so we can 
only keep our fingers crossed that Jo and Meg&#39;s romance will still be 
there, ne?
