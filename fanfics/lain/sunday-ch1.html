<h1>Sunday</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lain/index.html">Serial Experiments Lain</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/substance.html">Substance</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&lt;Just one more thing, the title of this little piece of rambling is 
taken  from the opening track (also called Sunday) of the new David 
Bowie album, Heathen. If you&#39;re in the  least bit interested in the 
thin white one, then check it out as it&#39;s not just one of the best  
songs he&#39;s done for a long time, it&#39;s one of the best songs he&#39;s ever 
written Full. Stop.&gt;

&lt;I personally felt the ending to Serial Experiments Lain was brilliant 
in  the most tragic, tear-jerking way possible. It hit me much more 
than, say, the ending of Eva  or even Cowboy Bebop. It was also 
strangely uplifting. I&#39;m one of these people who likes to  believe 
Lain sacrificed herself out of love for Alice, and there are one or 
two moments where Lain acts  rather flustered by Alice&#39;s attentions, 
hinting perhaps this love wasn&#39;t completely platonic. :) ok, as  a 
shoujoai fan I&#39;m pretty biased, but who are we except the sum of our 
biases?&gt;

Sunday:

&quot;Everything has changed...Nothing has changed...&quot;

The sun beat down heavily on the empty streets on the outskirts of  
Tokyo, driving all that stood below to a standstill. Neglected 
buildings with the whitewash flaking off  and rusted iron railings 
shimmered violently under the intense heat, and the noticeable absence 
of  life added to the insubstantiality and ghostliness of the scene. 
The road leading out from the  city centre had degraded to become 
little more than a dirt track that had seen little use from  traffic 
and yielded more footprints than tire tracks. The makeshift gardens 
had become overgrown with  weeds and any flowers had long since 
withered and died.

One lone woman walked in silence through the empty, shifting 
landscape.  Through the haze, only she appeared alive and real, and 
only her outline remained stable. Her  features were broad, well 
defined and healthy, and she stood a little taller than what might be 
called  average. Straight black hair ran down her back, just past the 
length where it started to look a  little awkward, and her make-up too 
also looked just slightly out of place on a face which, while  all too 
adult, had the open beauty and clarity of a young, innocent girl. Her 
eyes were singularly clear  and kind, but moved restlessly, as if she 
were never really sure of anything around her; as if  they were 
searching for something and knew not what they were searching for.

Eventually the woman stopped in front of a rough stone building that  
seemed even more unreal than those surrounding it. The rather crude 
spire and cross identified the  building to be a Christian Church, or 
at least some type of gathering place for those of the faith. A  
wooden frame feebly proclaimed the building to be the Holy Catholic 
Church of All Saints. The  woman felt slightly relieved at this. A 
catholic church meant lots of dogma, and any type of dogma was  
something that helped her focus, helped her in her search. Mizuki 
Alice took a deep hopeful breath and walked up to the wooden door,  
her fingers purposely twisting the loose handle until she heard the 
latch click quietly open and  felt the door give way

------------------------------------------------------------

After the grim heat of the summer sun, the coolness of the shade 
inside  the church was a welcome relief... and also a disappointment. 
Alice had been hoping for an ages heavy  atmosphere filled with the 
devout praying on their holy day, but the inside of the church was 
light and  airy and more than a little disorderly. A notice board was 
adorned with a child&#39;s rough crayon  drawings of families, crosses and 
other religious paraphernalia, along with an oft-altered timetable of  
religious sermons. Scanning downwards on the notice board, Alice 
spotted a little note at the end in  neat, scripted handwriting. The 
note said cheerfully that there would be no sermon this Sunday due to  
illness and apologised sincerely before wishing the Lord&#39;s blessing on 
the congregation. This was  no great truth; there was no weight to 
this, this was just part of a community. Something like this could  
not provide her with answers, or even give form to the questions.

Alice by now was ready to go home, but for some reason she couldn&#39;t  
fathom, she decided to search deeper into the church. Her feet guided 
her into the congregation room and  as she slowly drew into the main 
hall, she found herself disappointed even further. While all the main  
components of a church were in place, the altar and the lecterns 
looked completely inorganic and seemed  more like furniture or 
ornaments than the holy artifices of God. There were also only four 
pews at  the front, the rest being taken up by plastic chairs that 
seemed ready to collapse at any moment.  Alice ran a finger around the 
collar of her blouse and sighed in annoyance. The young teacher had 
gone out  of her way a fair bit to come to this, and it turned out to 
be a waste of her day. Not that every  other day spent searching so 
far hadn&#39;t been a waste as well.

Alice turned to leave suddenly found herself meeting the wide-eyed 
gaze  of a young woman who had been sitting silently at the side of 
the hall the whole time.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Alice noticeably jumped. &quot;You frightened me! I didn&#39;t realise  
there was anyone else in here!&quot; The teacher laughed nervously as she 
awaited the watcher&#39;s reaction. A small smile crossed the woman&#39;s pale 
features as she watched Alice  with a far-away look in her large brown 
eyes. Alice shifted a little uncomfortably under her gaze for a  
while, but soon ignored it and lost herself in studying her watcher 
intently. It was difficult to tell  her age: she was short and a 
little scrawny, her spaghetti-strap top showing limbs with the skin 
drawn  painfully tight across her elbows and shoulder blades. She had 
short, brown hair that hung in a single  pony-tail down her left 
cheek, highlighting her childish features even further: a small, 
narrow mouth and  nose contrasting sharply with deep brown eyes that 
held a kind of weariness completely at odds with her  waiflike 
appearance.

The feature that Alice found herself most drawn to though, was a fine 
red  scar running horizontally across the young woman&#39;s right cheek. 
As she gazed upon it, she felt an  unpleasant feeling rising in her 
stomach and clawing distantly at her heart. She dug deep within her 
mind to  find the source of the emotion, something she had been doing 
a lot of with little noticeable  success: perhaps she had known this 
woman and forgotten about her, or known someone like her? Something  
about the waiflike girl&#39;s appearance, and particularly the scar, 
seemed maddeningly familiar to  Alice&#39;s mind; but it was as though the 
events it reminded her of had been too painful, and her nerves had  
snapped shut on the memory to prevent the mysterious emotion from 
hitting her fully. Alice inwardly raged  with frustration, for all her 
adulthood it seemed as if she was missing the most vital fragments of 
life  and who she was... and this girl was intensifying that feeling 
to the point where the walls of Alice&#39;s  already fractured mind seemed 
ready to collapse completely.

All the time, the woman simply watched Alice&#39;s increasingly perplexed 
and  frustrated expression as though she was gazing at a particularly 
unique and beautiful painting. When  she felt Alice&#39;s eyes focus on 
her once more, however, she realized her staring was making her  
uncomfortable and her serene appearance cracked immediately. A blush 
sprang quickly onto to the woman&#39;s  pallid skin as she ducked her eyes 
and coughed nervously. It had been too far long and she was slowly  
forgetting the little nuances of communication... she couldn&#39;t afford 
to ruin things yet another time...

&quot;I... didn&#39;t mean to frighten you... I just,&quot; the woman stammered  
awkwardly over the words like an actress forgetting her lines, &quot;didn&#39;t 
expect someone to be in at this  time... um.&quot; A flash of inspiration, 
&quot;with the priest being off and all that...&quot; the quick, breathy voice 
fitted  well with her appearance: hollow and waiflike. Alice breathed 
a sigh of relief, this woman was real  after all and not just some 
silent illusion created by an overly tired mind. Still, she seemed 
familiar.

The teacher gave her most reassuring smile. &quot;That&#39;s alright,&quot; she 
said,  softening her voice, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to disturb you,&quot; another 
nervous laugh, &quot;I imagine you came here to be  by yourself. I&#39;ll be on 
my way if...&quot;

&quot;No! No! Actually, I... I could use some company...&quot; The words came 
out  too quick, too desperate. &quot;I mean... if you would, that is, if 
you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

Alice looked inquisitively at the woman, who seemed to grow more and 
more  vulnerable with each passing moment. She was clearly harbouring 
some great distress, her breath coming  quick and erratic and eyes 
glazed over with worry... and as those large brown eyes pleaded 
desperately  for her to stay, something tugged strongly at Alice&#39;s 
heartstrings. Nurturing those who needed it was  an integral part of 
who she was.

Alice walked calmly across to the woman, who seemed to grow 
increasingly&nbsp;nervous and uncomfortable as she neared. Sitting herself 
down on the adjacent chair, she reached over  with her hand and placed 
it softly on the woman&#39;s bare white arm, running it slowly upwards 
until it rested on  her shoulder. Alice shuddered inwardly at how cold 
her skin felt; it was clammy and unnatural, leading her  to think that 
perhaps the young woman was maybe some type of drug addict. Certainly, 
she seemed to  share the symptoms of someone who was frequently using 
cocaine, or maybe something stronger along the lines of  heroin or 
accel. Alice noted how the girl had initially froze at her touch, but 
had slowly relaxed, her  eyes closing halfway and breathing 
stabilising to a deep steady rhythm.

A moment passed before moist brown eyes turned back towards blue, the  
serene cast to them having been returned at the taller woman&#39;s touch. 
A sad smile forced its way onto her  features as tears started to 
trickle slowly down her cheeks.

Suddenly, the dam broke and the pale woman gripped Alice&#39;s arm with  
incredible ferocity, burying her head into the taller woman&#39;s shoulder 
and sobbing luxuriously. The young  teacher put an arm around the 
girl&#39;s shoulders and drew her into her comforting embrace, stroking 
her hair  and back to placate whatever demons were troubling the 
suffering girl&#39;s mind. Alice felt good offering  this kind of succor, 
it seemed that the day was not wasted after all. Judging from her 
state, this woman  was desperately lonely and without her having 
walked into the church at that point could have  deteriorated yet 
further. The opportunity to repair someone&#39;s life was something that 
the kind-hearted Alice would  trade any or all of her happiness to 
grasp.

Eventually the woman released her grip and pulled reluctantly, yet  
purposely away from the teacher&#39;s warmth, settling into a notably more 
distant position on her chair. Turning  her eyes away from Alice, the 
girl sat upright in her chair and stared intently ahead into the empty  
church, the space seeming to distort and ripple before her gaze. For 
an instant, all of her vulnerability  vanished and Alice froze as she 
felt the temperature around her increase drastically. Her head felt 
light and she  found it harder and harder to concentrate on the 
endlessly shifting scene around her.

Just as she felt she was about to black out, the dizziness stopped as  
quickly as it had taken hold. Alice blinked and shook her head a 
couple of times, trying to figure out what just  happened.

The teacher focused back on the pale woman sitting next to her, who 
was  now looking back at her with large, concerned eyes. Regret now 
played subtly along the contours of her  face; accentuating her 
weariness and making her look older than was at first apparent.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for what happened, you don&#39;t have to stay, I&#39;m just being  
selfish again.&quot; She murmured quietly, &quot;It always gets the better of 
me...&quot;

Alice smiled, trying not to look disconcerted by her previous spell 
of&nbsp;dizziness.

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; she cooed, &quot;just tell me what&#39;s wrong with you, best to 
get  it out of your system than leave it all trapped inside, hey?&quot;

The woman smiled tiredly and sighed. &quot;It&#39;s kinda complicated...&quot; the 
eyes  glanced out again into the hall for a moment, &quot;You know, I don&#39;t 
even know your name yet.&quot;

&quot;Alice,&quot; answered the teacher, looking a little embarrassed, &quot;it&#39;s an 
odd  name, I know. My parents took it from the Alice in Wonderland 
stories, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact I&#39;m  a Japanese with an 
English name.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s originally English,&quot; murmured the woman in  
reply, which made Alice start: it wasn&#39;t the answer she was expecting. 
&quot;Apparently it first appeared in its  current form in Germany, though 
I could be wrong. It sounds more French to me.&quot; A slight pause as the 
woman  raked through the information in her mind; &quot;However, I do know 
for certain that it means &#39;noble&#39;, or  &#39;truth&#39;.&quot;

The girl&#39;s smile suddenly turned natural as she made eye contact with  
Alice. The teacher felt the warmth that was before absent wash over 
her like a summer&#39;s tide. It had been a  long time since she felt 
anything like this, and she found herself unable to avoid smiling 
back. The nagging  feeling of familiarity came back: Alice felt that 
she had not only known this girl, but known her intimately.

The shorter woman continued, still smiling. &quot;It suits you better than 
you  think, you shouldn&#39;t be so embarrassed by it.&quot;

Alice blushed at the compliment, and took a moment to gather her wits  
sufficiently to reply. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she replied, still smiling, &quot;could 
you tell me yours?&quot;

The smile vanished from the girl&#39;s face, her eyes darted around 
nervously  before fixing themselves unerringly on Alice&#39;s face. The 
teacher guessed she was debating with  herself as to whether or not 
she should reveal her identity. Alice was about to assure the girl she 
didn&#39;t  have to give her name if she didn&#39;t want to when she suddenly 
took a deep breath and quickly stammered  out: &quot;Lain. Iwakura Lain.&quot;

The name echoed dangerously around the hall far more than the 
acoustics  should have allowed. The heat increased yet again, only to 
ebb when the sound faded back out of existence.  Alice blinked 
incredulously while she replayed the name over and over in her head. 
She had heard that  name somewhere before, she was certain, and not 
only that, it sounded like an answer. To what, she didn&#39;t  know, but 
it seemed to be the logical conclusion of everything and everyone 
around her.

Alice snapped back to reality and silently cursed her inattention; she  
was supposed to be listening to the girl, and not coming to irrational 
conclusions about her name. Alice  became seriously worried that 
sunstroke was starting to kick in; she made a mental note to take a 
long  break the next day before she started to seriously harm herself.

&quot;The heat&#39;s been getting to you, hasn&#39;t it?&quot; Lain said quietly, &quot;I can  
only hope that&#39;s the only thing bothering you.&quot;

Alice nodded, not wanting to worry the troubled woman with problems 
she  herself couldn&#39;t begin describe or understand.

&quot;I&#39;ve never been good with the sun, I&#39;ve always been a nocturnal 
creature  since my bad habits as a teenager.&quot; The teacher said, 
chuckling slightly. It was those bad habits she  had to deal with now 
as part of her job. &quot;Now go on, what were you going to say?&quot;

Lain sighed resignedly. &quot;It&#39;s to do with my job more than anything 
else,  I suppose...&quot;

&quot;What do you do?&quot; asked Alice, intrigued as to what type of job could  
cause this problem.

&quot;Well, I work the decks in a nightclub in central Tokyo. Cyberia? 
Maybe  you&#39;ve heard of it?&quot; the girl answered.

&quot;I know Cyberia alright, I was there every other night when I was  
younger, and you&#39;re a DJ there?&quot; Alice replied, &quot;I think a lot of 
people would be more than envious of your job, is  it not as rosy as 
it seems?&quot;

&quot;The job itself isn&#39;t too bad, but it seems to leave me permanently 
apart  from everyone else. I watch everyone else enjoying themselves 
and living their lives, their dramas,  while I&#39;m always on the edge; 
always there, but never truly a part of the world, so to speak.&quot; Lain 
shifted  nervously, &quot;but that wouldn&#39;t normally be a problem if it 
wasn&#39;t for the circumstances that brought be to  here.&quot;

Alice put a reassuring hand on the woman&#39;s shoulder, motioning her to  
continue, there was no obvious reaction to her touch, but she 
nonetheless resumed her tale.

&quot;I had to leave my previous life behind to come to Tokyo... but there 
was  nothing left anymore. I discovered I had been adopted and no one 
knew who my real parents were. My  adopted parents had given me my 
name and DNA testing brought up no matches. That wasn&#39;t the worst blow  
however.&quot; Lain&#39;s eyes became misty with tears, and she turned them 
away from Alice, unwilling to let her see  her pain. &quot;I had to leave 
behind the one I loved, but it was the only choice I had... I had 
caused too much  pain already, and would only have continued to had I 
not left.&quot;

The teacher shook her head sadly: a broken heart was nothing to be 
taken  lightly. Although she had been singularly lucky herself, she 
had seen its effects before in many a young  girl and the mending 
process could be long and painful and not always successful. Not 
wanting to push Lain too  quickly on the road to recovery, she decided 
to ask for more information.

&quot;This one you loved, could you tell me about him? If it doesn&#39;t bother  
you?&quot; she asked tentatively.

Lain gave a low, tired laugh and smiled painfully at Alice, shaking 
her  head. &quot;Sorry, but I kinda guessed you would say that,&quot; she 
replied, forcing herself to meet Alice&#39;s eyes again  before continuing 
slowly, &quot;I&#39;ll be honest with you... I well... she... was another 
woman...&quot; Lain trailed  off and held her breath as she awaited the 
teacher&#39;s reaction.

&quot;Oh, I am sorry!&quot; Alice answered; looking rather embarrassed &quot;It just  
didn&#39;t cross my mind that you may be, erm...&quot;

&quot;A lesbian? Don&#39;t worry about it. It just means a great deal to me 
that  you&#39;re not disgusted, thank you.&quot; That rare genuine smile 
flashed again, causing Alice to yet again smile  back. The teacher had 
decided she liked that smile, and was disappointed when it vanished 
again. Truth be  told, Alice was actually quite intrigued by Lain&#39;s 
admission as she had yet to properly talk to anyone who  was decidedly 
homosexual. She had always before encountered them as friends or 
acquaintances of other people  and it was relatively new to have one 
sitting right next to her, paying her full attention. &quot;Anyhow, tell me 
about her, I imagine she must have been something pretty  special.&quot; 
She asked, sitting up in her chair.

&quot;Well, she really was one of a kind, utterly captivating... if you 
don&#39;t  mind me saying this,&quot; Lain said softly, smiling at the memory, 
&quot;she didn&#39;t look too different from yourself,  about the same height 
and build; even the same hair colour, though she wore hers much 
shorter than you do.&quot;

Alice grinned, she felt strangely pleased to be compared to Lain&#39;s 
dream  girl. &quot;Funny that, I used to have short hair myself at one 
point, just a little longer than yours is now,&quot;  Alice&#39;s face became 
serious again, &quot;but I suppose it&#39;s more to do with personality than 
appearance, yes?&quot;

&quot;It goes without saying, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Lain replied. &quot;Yes. She was 
kind;  utterly selfless; she was prepared to look after me, put up 
with me even, when no one else did. She reached  through to me no 
matter how many barriers I put in place and when all was chaos and 
nothingness it was her  that remained, pulling me back from the edge.&quot;

Lain looked down at her hands, unconsciously playing with and 
stretching  the fingers of one with the other. Alice shifted a little 
closer to her and gingerly touched her arm. &quot;It  sounded as though she 
cared greatly for you,&quot; she said, supportively.

&quot;She did, yes...&quot; Lain&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t move from her hands. &quot;She doesn&#39;t  
anymore though. Well, hopefully she doesn&#39;t; I wanted her to forget 
me. I hurt her so many times, it&#39;s all for  the best.&quot;

Alice frowned, wondering what it could be that this seemingly innocent  
young woman could have done to cause so much harm and trying hard to 
shake the feeling that she already knew.

Lain seemed to hear Alice&#39;s unspoken question and sucked her lower lip  
thoughtfully for a moment before answering. &quot;I interfered with her 
life one time too often, I wanted to help her, but  she only ended up 
getting seriously hurt... physically and mentally.&quot; Alice felt herself 
shudder as Lain said  the last three words; once again she found 
herself drawn to the scar on the girl&#39;s cheek. &quot;I do a lot of work  
utilizing the Wired, it can be a very, very dangerous place. It only 
takes one error.&quot;

There was an extended silence between the two as Alice tried to figure  
out what to say to the girl next after such a confession. The air 
between them shimmered uneasily and it became  harder to make out 
Lain&#39;s outline even despite her closeness, as though she was willing 
the heat to keep her  hidden.

&quot;Surely if your intentions were good, then she would be able to 
forgive  you?&quot; Alice ventured. She herself would have found it 
extremely difficult to keep up a grudge against someone  so 
vulnerable.

Lain shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s not so much that,&quot; she answered. &quot;It&#39;s just  
too dangerous that I see her, it seems I&#39;m destined to do her harm... 
but I can&#39;t keep it up forever. I&#39;ve watched  her from afar for as 
long as I can remember, and once my resolve eventually cracked and I 
approached her: she  didn&#39;t recognize me, which I expected, of 
course.&quot;

Alice looked carefully at Lain&#39;s features; she found it rather 
confusing  that anyone could forget them completely as they were 
rather distinct: singularly childlike with that scar  across her 
cheek. There was of course, the chance that she had picked up the 
wound after the separation,  and maybe the girl didn&#39;t previously have 
the same unhealthy cast to her features.

&quot;It stung that she didn&#39;t recognise me, but all the same, it was 
heaven  to see her and talk to her again,&quot; Lain continued, &quot;there were 
one or two things that had changed obviously,  but she was still the 
same warm and selfless person she had always been, and still every bit 
as beautiful as I  remembered.&quot;

Unexpectedly, Lain then shifted nearer to Alice and rested her head on  
her shoulder, wrapping her right arm across the taller woman&#39;s neck 
and sobbing quietly into her jacket. The  crying had none of the 
urgency that it had held earlier now, and there was a certain ease 
with which she embraced  the teacher.

Alice reluctantly returned the embrace, enfolding Lain&#39;s wispy, 
scrawny  form with her own strength. Although it physically felt good 
to be holding her like this, she felt shamefully  uneasy about the 
girl&#39;s sexuality and couldn&#39;t help but wonder what exactly she was 
feeling, especially  considering her own physical similarity to the 
recipient of Lain&#39;s admiration. Perhaps she was imagining herself in 
her  love&#39;s embrace instead of her own? The thought actually made 
Alice feel vaguely jealous... jealous that Lain should  need someone 
else instead. It was odd that she was feeling so possessive over a 
complete stranger, but she  couldn&#39;t shake the feeling Lain wasn&#39;t a 
complete stranger.

Eventually, Lain lifted her head from Alice&#39;s shoulder, but she didn&#39;t  
relax her grip on the taller woman. Brown eyes looked appraisingly 
into blue, searching for confirmation of  something hiding within.

&quot;What about yourself, though?&quot; Lain cooed quietly.

&quot;Myself? What do you...?&quot; Alice replied; feeling slightly flustered 
by&nbsp;the proximity of Lain&#39;s face to her own.

&quot;Why are you here? I know you don&#39;t come here regularly, so I imagine 
I&#39;m  not the only one with something on their mind?&quot; The girl said, 
smiling as though she already knew the answer.  Alice thought that 
there was something oddly coquettish about that smile, but then again, 
she could be  just imagining it? In fact she was starting to wonder if 
this whole encounter was just the result of a confused  and tired 
mind. Alice almost laughed out loud at that: what would a psychiatrist 
say when she told him that while  in a deserted church she had 
imagined and had an in-depth conversation with a scrawny five foot 
lesbian called  Lain who looked like the end result of a month long 
cocaine binge?

&quot;Well, it&#39;s kinda complicated...&quot; Alice replied, echoing the pale 
woman&#39;s  earlier words. &quot;I doubt you&#39;d take me seriously if I even 
tried to explain it.&quot;

Lain released her grip and pulled back into what she hoped was a less  
demanding, more inviting position: smile quietly begging Alice to 
continue.

&quot;erm...&quot; Alice started, looking nervously around, worried in case 
someone  else was listening in on her make a fool of herself. All 
other reactions she had got to her situation had been  pretty 
negative: Alice had been patronized, greeted with confused looks and 
sometimes openly laughed at.  Something about Lain, though, told her 
that she would be perfectly safe telling this woman anything.

&quot;In your own time,&quot; Lain encouraged, waiting patiently for the teacher 
to  begin.

Alice took a deep breath. &quot;Have you ever had the feeling that 
something&#39;s  missing from your life, and you don&#39;t know what it is?&quot;

Lain&#39;s eyes lit up suddenly at Alice&#39;s words. The teacher was suitably  
surprised; she could have sworn she had seen some type of desperate 
hope building there within.

&quot;I... don&#39;t quite know what you mean, could you elaborate... Alice?&quot; 
she  asked, genuinely curious.

&quot;It&#39;s hard to describe. Whatever it is, it&#39;s something that&#39;s just 
beyond  my reach, just beyond my sight even...&quot; Alice played 
absentmindedly with a shirt cuff as she struggled to  find appropriate 
words. &quot;It&#39;s as though something important happened earlier on in my 
life and I&#39;d just  completely forgotten about it, and all of reality 
is nothing but a thin veneer that constantly shifts to hide it from  
my view...&quot;

&quot;So you come to places like this in search of answers?&quot; Lain ventured.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Alice replied, marveling at how Lain seemed to be genuinely  
fascinated by what she was saying. &quot;I haven&#39;t found any answers yet. 
Meeting you here has probably been the best  thing to come out of it.&quot;

Lain&#39;s cheeks coloured, causing Alice&#39;s mind to go into overdrive. &lt;oh  
no, that probably sounded like I was making a pass at her... what the 
hell is wrong with me? Come on, Alice, at  this rate you&#39;re gonna 
start giving the poor little girl ideas... you don&#39;t want to do that, 
do you?&gt;

&quot;Why do you say that?&quot; asked Lain incredulously, &quot;all I&#39;ve done is  
imposed myself on you; if anything I&#39;ve been wasting your time.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve, well... you&#39;ve given me the opportunity to help you, my being  
able to be there for someone when hey&#39;re in need makes me feel better 
about myself, like I&#39;m worth something.&quot;  Alice punctuated her 
sentence with a small depreciating laugh, &quot;recently it seems that I&#39;m 
of no use to anyone  at all... my husband is quite a bit older than I 
am and highly sure of himself, so I frequently feel as though  I&#39;m the 
one always being protected and nurtured. Don&#39;t get me wrong, we&#39;re 
perfectly happy together and I do love  him, but I just feel... well, 
like I&#39;m not needed. My job as a teacher relieves that to a certain 
extent,  but...&quot;

&quot;You need to nurture people on a more personal level?&quot;

Alice sighed and nodded sadly. &quot;I imagine it must sound horribly 
selfish,  like I&#39;m wishing pain on people just so I can relieve them 
of it,&quot; she said, smiling guiltily at her  companion. &quot;I suppose I 
needed you just as much as you needed me, huh?&quot;

&quot;I suppose...&quot; said Lain, dreamily. &quot;If so, then... thank you, Alice.&quot;

The two sat in silence for a moment, and just for an instant, 
everything  came into focus for the teacher for what seemed to be the 
first time in her life. The doubts that assailed her  mind vanished 
completely as gazed into Lain&#39;s infinitely deep brown eyes: it was as 
though she had finally  found the answer to everything within this 
strange young woman. Alice reached out with her hand slowly through 
the  shimmering air to rest gently against Lain&#39;s cheek, fascinated at 
the feel of her skin. She felt so cold,  yet so... real, as though 
everything else was an illusion and there was only this woman. The 
idea, Alice knew,  was absurd, but somehow it made such perfect sense.

Lain froze in disbelief as she watched Alice&#39;s features... she had 
been  right. So many times she had told herself to keep away, told 
herself that she had brought nothing but harm to  this wonderful, 
perfect, angelic woman, and now it seemed that just maybe Alice needed 
her as much as she  longed for Alice...

Noting Lain&#39;s wide-eyed expression, Alice quickly snatched her hand 
away  from the girl&#39;s cheek and inwardly chastised herself. She had 
probably scared the girl half to death acting  like she had: just what 
was wrong with her?

Alice stammered, &quot;Sorry... I... I lost it for a minute there, I didn&#39;t  
mean to...&quot;

&quot;No! No! It&#39;s alright!&quot; the pale woman urgently reassured, &quot;you&#39;ve 
done  nothing you have to apologise for! I&#39;ve been taking advantage of 
you when you needed solace yourself, I...&quot;

&quot;No! I&#39;ve already said, it&#39;s you who&#39;s helped me, Lain! Don&#39;t...&quot; 
Alice  stopped in mid-sentence and gave a frustrated sigh, putting a 
hand to her forehead and standing up from the  seat. &quot;I apologise 
again, I&#39;m confused, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying, or doing, or 
feeling anymore...I...&quot; she  turned to face Lain, &quot;I have to go, I&#39;m 
sorry, I don&#39;t want to, but...&quot;

The shorter girl stood up and nodded sympathetically. She knew all too  
well what it was like to not know oneself, and after all, it was her 
fault that Alice was in the state she was  in: it was her that had 
tampered with the teacher&#39;s memory, but what else could she have done? 
Lain sighed  sadly at her inability to do anything right concerning 
Alice, and hoped that just this time she could put things  right once 
and for all.

Lain reached tentatively out and touched Alice&#39;s arm. &quot;I understand, 
it  must be terrible what you&#39;re going through&quot; she said softly, &quot;if 
you need to be alone for a while, that I won&#39;t  stop you.&quot;

Alice sniffed. She was, to her annoyance, starting to cry. &quot;I will see  
you again, though? Right? You do have a communicator right? I 
could...&quot;

Lain placed a finger on Alice&#39;s lips, silencing her. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, all  
you have to is look for me and you will find me... the Wired stretches 
a long way, Alice. I will be there for  you, when, or if, you should 
need me.&quot;

Alice nodded, tears trickling down her face. Lain shuddered inwardly,  
remembering the last time she had seen Alice cry this way, it was the 
most painful sight she had ever known and she  couldn&#39;t bear to see it 
again.

Before she was quite sure of what she was doing, Lain&#39;s physical form  
reacted against her will to Alice&#39;s tears. Closing her eyes, the 
shorter girl slipped her arms lightly around  the teacher&#39;s neck and 
enveloped her lips within her own, softly kissing away her pain. Alice 
initially started  at Lain&#39;s touch, but quickly relaxed and much to 
her surprise, found herself closing her eyes and returning the  kiss. 
Oddly enough, she didn&#39;t feel the slightest bit shocked that she was 
kissing another woman. There was  nothing wrong or unpleasant about 
the sensation and she didn&#39;t feel the pangs of guilt or unease that 
she got  from contact with her older husband. If Lain did desire for 
something else from it, she wasn&#39;t imposing  it on Alice and all she 
felt from the contact was pure comfort.

Reluctantly, Lain finally pulled away from Alice&#39;s still searching 
lips  and smiled contentedly at her. &quot;Now, go.&quot; She said quietly.

Alice nodded, and walked quickly out of the church all the time 
looking  back over her shoulder at Lain&#39;s figure, which seemed to grow 
more and more indistinct with each glance,  fading gradually into the 
air until she was nowhere to be seen. At first Alice started to panic, 
but then remembered  the young woman&#39;s words. She would be there when 
she needed her... and when Alice was ready; she would reveal  what lay 
behind the curtain and hidden deep in the recesses of her mind, 
terrifying though it might be.

As she strode out into the blistering heat of the summer&#39;s sun, Alice  
saw the abandoned houses and overgrown gardens, still every bit as 
unreal and insubstantial as she had left them.  But now it was 
different: now Alice could feel Lain&#39;s innocent brown eyes watching 
her protectively from behind  each and every one.

------------------------------------------------------------

Lain watched silently as Alice trudged back towards her car. She 
didn&#39;t  know how things would develop from within the teacher, but for 
now, it felt great to know she could be of  some use to her love. She 
knew she could not get too optimistic, as it was impossible to tell 
how Alice could  react once her memories her restored. She may hate 
her for it; or it may prove too much and result in her losing  it 
completely.

For the moment, she had to leave Alice to her thoughts. Closing her 
eyes,  Lain faded back into the Wired: nothing more than the noise on 
the wires...

------------------------------------------------------------

&lt;That proved to be every bit as difficult as I imagined. Seeing as 
this is  only attempt number two I could have attempted something just 
a little easier than a Serial Experiments Lain  fanfic... oh well, it 
could have been worse: I could have attempted something on Utena! :) 
Anyhow, feedback on  this little monstrosity would be greatly 
appreciated. I&#39;ve read it over several times and still can&#39;t tell how  
successful I&#39;ve been...&gt;</pre>
