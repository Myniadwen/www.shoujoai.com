<pre>	People change.

	I know that. I&#39;ve always known that. I&#39;ve just never seen it 
happen right in front of my eyes.

	It&#39;s strange, to see it happen. To see someone change into 
something completely different from what they were. It hasn&#39;t even 
really happened yet and still...

	I can already see it.

	I can see the change coming.

	And that&#39;s what bothers me so much. I don&#39;t really know why 
it does. I suppose it&#39;s because of how she acts. Or how she used to 
act, that is.

	Lain.

	She was always so quiet.

	Quiet, meek, and unassuming. She was there but not and 
something about her made me feel protective.

	Made me feel...

	Oh, I don&#39;t know. All I know is that she&#39;s changing. She&#39;s not 
what she used to be and that scares me.

	This new Lain isn&#39;t the one I&#39;m used to. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m 
supposed to protect her now. I don&#39;t even know if she wants me to or 
if I&#39;m needed to.

	I just know that this change scares me.

	She doesn&#39;t scare me. She could never scare me.

	It felt nice, you know.

	To be needed. Reika and Juri, they don&#39;t need me. I&#39;m their 
friend, that&#39;s true but I&#39;m not that important to them.

	But with her... with Lain I felt important.

	I felt needed.

	Now she&#39;s changing. Changing so much that soon she won&#39;t 
need me anymore.

	And I&#39;ll still need her.

	It&#39;s selfish, but I wish that people wouldn&#39;t change.

	Sometimes things are better when they stay the same.

The character of Alice is from Serial Experiments Lain. This series 
totally amazed me and I was inspired to write this vignette from Alice&#39;s 
point of view because I found her such an interesting character. Oh, 
and the opening song for this series is just great! Lyrics from it are 
provided below.
