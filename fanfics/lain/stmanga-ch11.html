<h1>St Manga School (part 11 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lain/index.html">Serial Experiments Lain</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lain/stmanga-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>It&#39;s always tempting to skip a few classes now and again, especially if 
the lessons were exceedingly boring or if the teachers were considered 
as Mr or Miss nasty. A bunch of girls, as well as peace-boy, Garnet 
gathered round two benches behind the walls of the science labs, and in 
front of some tall trees, which led to the wide green space in the 
school field. One the bench on the right, Tomo, Chiyo, Osaka and Yomi 
were spaced out and gathered on the bench. Tomo was dancing around on 
the bench. She was moving her hips around and started, &quot;Tima kissed your 
mama! Tima kissed your mama! Tima kissed your mama!&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Yomi requested as she had her head stuck in a book. &quot;Half of 
St Manga can hear you!&quot; Chiyo and Osaka giggled at Tomo as she watched 
her go hyper.

Garnet, Shyst, Luna, Cho, Chloe and Tima were just on the bench next to 
them as they watched Tomo dance around as well.

&quot;And I kissed her good!&quot; Tima replied, listening to her music on her 
ipod. She then laughed, &quot;Tomo you&#39;re weird.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s mama did you kiss Tima?&quot; Osaka, a girl with straight raven hair 
up to her shoulders asked.

&quot;I didn&#39;t kiss anybody&#39;s mama,&quot; Tima smirked as she grinned at Osaka. 
&quot;Some nigger wrote it on the wall as a joke!&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Osaka said in a higher volume of tone. &quot;Isn&#39;t that N word 
offensive?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just a word,&quot; Tima replied as she chuckled endlessly. &quot;You lot are 
all crazy!&quot;

&quot;The wind is calling me,&quot; Garnet admitted as he stood up and breathed in 
content. &quot;It is sending me a message!&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tima chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s telling you to die!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know the miracles of nature,&quot; Garnet snapped as he glared at 
the ginger streaked Tima. &quot;Mother nature can talk to me, it is telling 
me that it needs help. I will do Mother Nature...&quot;

&quot;Eww... You&#39;re crazy Garnet; you want to have sex with Mother nature!&quot; 
Tima smirked as she rested her head on the table. Chloe patted her head 
as started to play with her hair. &quot;Don&#39;t mess up my hair please,&quot; Tima 
requested to Chloe. &quot;I know my hair is awesome, but don&#39;t mess it up.&quot;

&quot;I will do Mother nature&#39;s wishes.&quot; Garnet corrected as he slapped 
Tima&#39;s head.

&quot;So what is the wind telling you?&quot; Chloe asked Garnet curiously.

&quot;It is crying,&quot; Garnet announced emotionally staring into the sky. &quot;It 
desires... WORLD PEACE!&quot;

&quot;Oh really now?&quot; Tima asked in disbelief as she sat up again, &quot;You say 
some crazy shit Garnet. If the wind told you to kiss Shyst, would you do 
it?&quot;

&quot;Of course I would!&quot; Garnet replied with his fist in the air. &quot;The wind 
is calling me to do it now!&quot; The brown haired boy pushed the timid Shyst 
into his arms, held onto her pink dress and then in their embrace, he 
kissed her. Shyst felt unable to move and looked defiantly unprepared 
for her first kiss. His face was pressing against her glasses but she 
felt the passion from Garnet.

&quot;WOH!&quot; Tima gasped as she and the rest of the girls looked at Garnet and 
Shyst kissing passionately in front of them. Tomo movements halted as 
she saw Shyst and Garnet passionately kissing. She opened her mouth in 
shock and started moving around again, this time she sang. &quot;Garnet 
kissed Shyst! Garnet kissed Shyst!&quot;

Shyst broke the kiss from a sudden shock from Tomo&#39;s shouting. Her hand 
was collapsed to her heart as she was still in quite a shock. Yomi 
closed her book and faced Shyst as she stood up.

&quot;I apologize for this,&quot; Yomi replied as she carried Tomo into her arms 
and then dropped her deliberately. Tomo screamed in tears as she shaking 
her legs around. &quot;That should shut you up for a while.&quot;

&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not fair!&quot; Tomo shouted as she grabbed onto Yomi&#39;s leg 
tightly. Yomi then stood on her breast, Tomo was quickly startled and 
started screaming even more.

Garnet then grabbed the purple haired beauty&#39;s hand and asked, &quot;Shyst, 
follow me,&quot; Shyst looked at him in quite a shocked facial expression. 
&quot;Let&#39;s go somewhere only we know!&quot;

&quot;OK,&quot; Shyst smiled as she cheerfully ran with Garnet and disappeared 
from the rest of the group.

&quot;Crazy people,&quot; Tima announced as she saw the pair of them run away.

&quot;They make a very nice couple don&#39;t they?&quot; Luna admitted whilst peering 
a smile on her face as she sat next to Cho.

&quot;Yeah, they do.&quot; Cho replied as she felt secretly jealous that they have 
love, and she was still unlucky in love.

Rebecca and Luke marched over to the benches as they looked over to see 
why Tomo was screaming. &quot;What are you doing Tomo?&quot; Luke asked whilst he 
gasped in sheer horror from how childish Tomo was looking sobbing on the 
floor. &quot;Grow up Tomo, you psycho!&quot;

&quot;Ti... ki ... you.. ma...&quot; Tomo was sobbing so hard, she could not be 
understood. &quot;Gar...net ... kiss shit!&quot;

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Rebecca shouted out loudly wrinkling her face. &quot;What&#39;s 
Ti-Ki-Ma? And Garnet is sick for kissing that!&quot;

&quot;She said Tima kissed your mama!&quot; Osaka told her as she pointed at Tima. 
&quot;And Garnet kissed Shyst!&quot;

&quot;Is that why they&#39;re running like children?&quot; Luke asked sarcastically.

&quot;How was it at principle Tsunade&#39;s office?&quot; Chloe asked them both as 
Rebecca squeezed Luke into her arms. &quot;What did she say?&quot;

&quot;Tsunade was like, &#39;REBECCA YOU ARE A FUCKING SLUT! &#39; She slapped me as 
well! She was really pissed off. You should have been there, she was 
screaming the place down.&quot;

&quot;The principle was completely out of order!&quot; Luke stated as he opened 
his mouth and started listing all the bad things that had happened. &quot;She 
was violent, she was aggressive, she was spitting, she was loud and she 
was cruel!&quot;

&quot;What did she say?&quot; Luna asked.

&quot;She was even worse than the last time,&quot; Rebecca complained. &quot;She was 
ranting about how stupid we are and how pathetic we were.&quot; Rebecca&#39;s 
eyes started to water as tried hard not to cry.

&quot;She told Rebecca,&quot; Luke continued. &quot;That if the school would be a 
happier place if she dropped dead and I committed suicide! See how out 
of order she really was, I then said that she was out of order and then 
gave me a death threat!&quot; Rebecca started crying as she rested in Luke&#39;s 
shoulders. &quot;Then Umbrigde, that cow came over after we went out the room 
where Tsunade had a go at us, then Umbrigde came over said, &#39;You guys 
now, deep down; you deserve to be punished!&#39; They were both out of 
order. Look they&#39;ve even made Rebecca cry.&quot;

&quot;What did they punish you with?&quot; Osaka asked as she helped Tomo get up 
and return to the bench.

&quot;She&#39;s given us a week supply of detentions starting Monday. We have to 
sit there all of break, lunch and for two hours after school doing 
nothing. If we make a sound, it gets extended. How stupid is that?&quot; Luke 
had no idea why this happened to him, he didn&#39;t drink, he didn&#39;t smoke 
and he didn&#39;t do drugs. Rebecca however, did smoke and drink and was 
always getting into trouble for the most craziest things. He felt he 
shouldn&#39;t have to suffer for the wild Rebecca but he did, because he 
loved her.</pre>
