<h1>St Manga School (part 4 of 17)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lain/index.html">Serial Experiments Lain</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cgholy.html">C. Gholy</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lain/stmanga-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Dawn had spent the first five minutes of break in the girls&#39; toilets. 
Her lip-gloss was gently shimmering on her pink lips; she had just about 
finished fixing her makeup. Some of the other girls, like Ino, Rukia and 
Misty, were doing the same. Dawn smiled at Misty and the redhead smiled 
in return. The blue-haired girl stepped behind her as Misty turned 
around. &quot;Hi Misty!&quot; She smiled, in an excited manner opening her arms 
and hugging Misty tightly.

&quot;Hi Dawn!&quot; Misty replied in a neutral tone. &quot;How are you?&quot; She asked.

&quot;Oh I&#39;m ok,&quot; Dawn had replied cheerfully. &quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#39;m fine,&quot; Misty smiled. &quot;I&#39;m just shocked.&quot;

&quot;Shocked!&quot; Dawn said. &quot;How come?&quot;

&quot;I had no idea that Tyson and Kai were an item,&quot; Misty told Dawn almost 
slightly whispering.

&quot;You mean the Tyson that&#39;s in Ash&#39;s class!&quot; Dawn exclaimed. &quot;Oh my god I 
don&#39;t believe it! How come it&#39;s always the hot guys that are gay?&quot;

&quot;Whose gay?&quot; Ino, a blonde wearing a purple silky shirt and black 
trousers, interrupted.

&quot;Tyson and Kai,&quot; Dawn replied, turning to face Ino. &quot;Misty told me just 
now.&quot;

&quot;Those two are gay?&quot; Ino asked again in disbelief. &quot;Kai is more asexual 
than homosexual. As for Tyson; isn&#39;t he straight? I thought he was 
dating Hilary?&quot;

&quot;That was just a rumour,&quot; Misty announced. &quot;Him and Hilary were just 
friends; they never went out.&quot;

&quot;Wait,&quot; Ino didn&#39;t quite believe what she was hearing. &quot;How do you know 
they&#39;re gay?&quot;

&quot;Daisy, my sister.&quot; Misty answered with attitude. &quot;She was having drama 
and she saw them kissing in the back of the drama studio.&quot; Misty took 
out her cell phone, scrolling down to her inbox. &quot;She took a picture of 
it, and she sent it to me. I also saw them at the back of the drama 
studio, but they were doing work.&quot; Misty showed the picture that she was 
going on about to Dawn and Ino. The image contained the back of Kai&#39;s 
head and the front side of Tyson&#39;s face. Ino zoomed closer to the 
picture dropping her face in excitement. &#39;dropping her face&#39;, do you 
mean &#39;dropping her jaw&#39;?

&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Ino exclaimed. &quot;They&#39;re gay! Wow, wait till I confront that 
homo skiver!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s homophobic behavior!&quot; Dawn pointed out. Ino and Misty stared at 
Dawn with a weird expression on their face.

&quot;No it&#39;s not!&quot; Misty replied, giggling with Ino. &quot;Anyway, Gary&#39;s been 
sending me a lot of messages recently.&quot;

&quot;You mean Gary Oak?&quot; Ino asked leaning her head forward, facing Misty 
and instantly cutting Dawn out of the conversation.

&quot;Yeah, him!&quot; Misty nodded. &quot;Today he hugged me as well.&quot; Misty had 
started to become bright red in the face, whilst giggling to herself at 
the same time.

&quot;I know what it is!&quot; Ino shouted out. &quot;You two are in love,&quot; Ino started 
laughing with Misty. &quot;Come to think of it, you and Gary would make a 
great couple.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.

&quot;Didn&#39;t you have a huge crush on Ash?&quot; Ino asked curiously crossing her 
arms.

Misty nodded back. &quot;I&#39;m sick of tired of waiting for him.&quot; Misty 
admitted. &quot;I&#39;m just gonna be friends with him.&quot;

&quot;Good for you,&quot; Ino replied, &quot;and Gary is hell of a lot hotter than 
Ash.&quot;

&quot;Yeah he is,&quot; Misty said.

Dawn exited the bathroom, leaving Misty and Ino to gossip amongst 
themselves. As she left, she spotted a redheaded tomboy walking along 
the corridor, and noticed it was one of her friends, Zoey, who was her 
dance partner in dance. She saw Zoey turn around quickly, and cried out, 
&quot;Hey Zoey!&quot; giving a wave. Zoey smiled and waved back, then marched a 
few steps towards Dawn.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Zoey replied coolly. &quot;Are we able to practice our dance routine 
tonight after school?&quot;

&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; Dawn replied. &quot;I need to practice anyway.&quot;

&quot;Indeed you do!&quot; Zoey said sharply. &quot;We need to work on your timing and 
sharpness in your moves. Things that I am willing to help you with.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Dawn replied. &quot;Can you help me on set study too?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Zoey breathed. &quot;Anyway, how long are going to stay for?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Dawn answered honestly. &quot;Until you&#39;re satisfied.&quot; Dawn 
was feeling quite nervous, she was doing a duo with Zoey for her dance 
exam. The exam was still a long way away, but the dance needed to be 
perfect nonetheless. Dawn had absolutely no idea what she was going to 
do for her duo; she was hoping that Zoey had some ideas. &quot;You know our 
duo?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot;

&quot;Well, I haven&#39;t got any ideas for it.&quot; Dawn admitted. &quot;I hope you&#39;re 
not angry with me.&quot;

&quot;Practice sessions are vital, then!&quot; Zoey stated sighing at the same 
time. &quot;Meet me at lunch,&quot; She said. &quot;I want you in your dance kit at 
lunchtime, ok.&quot;

&quot;Ok,&quot; Dawn replied.

&quot;Dawn,&quot; Zoey said as she went to hold her hand. &quot;I know I may sound 
strict and all but the truth is, I really care for you.&quot; Zoey looked up 
at Dawn and smiled. &quot;I know you love dancing very much. That&#39;s why I 
want to help you. There are other reasons too,&quot; Zoey admitted.

&quot;Which are what?&quot; Dawn asked curiously.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you when the time is right.&quot; Zoey told Dawn. &quot;Misty was 
telling me that her sister caught Tyson and Kai kissing in the back of 
the dram studio.&quot; Zoey pointed out weirdly.

&quot;Misty told me that too.&quot; Dawn replied. &quot;She also showed me a picture of 
them kissing.&quot;

&quot;Good for them then.&quot; Zoey announced. &quot;Guy on guy action is hot as well 
as girl on girl.&quot; She then remained silent for quite a bit. &quot;Anyway, I 
gotta go. I have a detention with Kakashi.&quot;

&quot;What for?&quot; Dawn asked.

&quot;I gave him a bit of lip.&quot; Zoey admitted, laughing to herself. &quot;I kicked 
the ball and it was about to hit his face until he caught it. He and 
Harley, they were teasing me like hell. So, I kinda flipped. Although I 
didn&#39;t intend to, and now I got detention for it. See ya around, Dawn.&quot;

Dawn watched Zoey walk away in a cool manner. She found it quite 
appealing and Zoey didn&#39;t sound like she was bothered about the 
detention at all. One thing that Dawn noticed about Zoey was that she 
was always relaxed, and she meant every word she said. Dawn wondered if 
Zoey actually liked her much more than a friend. But whether it was the 
love of a sister, or the love of a girlfriend, she didn&#39;t know.

When Zoey was out of her sight, Dawn walked by herself. she would 
usually have been hanging around with her friends, however, they were 
nowhere to be seen. She pushed the wooden door open and stepped outside 
the building into the school grounds. Dawn spotted Ash and May together 
in a rather caring manner, holding hands, and giggling with each other. 
She approached the pair of them, they faced her, and they all smiled. &quot;I 
take it you two are going out, I presume?&quot;

&quot;Erm...&quot; May paused for quite a long time, &quot;Yeah, we are.&quot;

&quot;She just told me how she felt about me,&quot; Ash added happily, wrapping 
his arm around the brunette&#39;s arm. Dawn smiled, feeling happy for her 
friends.

&quot;So that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t find you?&quot; Dawn said. &quot;Anyway, I won&#39;t be here 
at lunch.&quot; She told them. &quot;I gotta practice my dance routines.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Ash replied. &quot;We&#39;ll see you after school, then?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in dance practice after school as well.&quot; She admitted. &quot;So I&#39;ll see 
you tomorrow.&quot;

A vicious, direct bell rung. Time seemed to have flown at the speed of 
light. All three of them returned tothe school building.

&quot;Yeah, see you tomorrow!&quot; Ash called to Dawn. She gave a quick wave and 
walked into the second classroom on the left. &quot;So I guess we have Maths 
now?&quot; Ash sighed heavily.

&quot;Yep!&quot; May replied.

&quot;Shit,&quot; Ash muttered in agony. &quot;Trigonometry!&quot; He yelled unhappily. 
&quot;It&#39;s too hard for me!&quot;

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry about it!&quot; May assured him. &quot;I&#39;ll help you. Even 
though it&#39;s pretty hard for me too.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, love.&quot; Ash replied happily kissing her cheek in front of the 
class.

&quot;Got yourself a girlfriend now I see?&quot; A female voice came from behind 
him. Ash turned around to see his mother, Delia Ketchum, who was also 
his maths teacher.

&quot;Hi, mom,&quot; Ash said in an embarrassed tone. &quot;Yeah, May is my 
girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;How nice,&quot; Delia said happily. &quot;Don&#39;t get too carried away,&quot; Delia 
reminded her son. &quot;And use a condom as well!&quot;

The rest of the class were sniggering away, but looking at the new 
couple at the same time. There was a knock at the door; Principal 
Tsunade could be seen out the window. They also spotted another boy 
beside her, who seemed very new to the school.

&quot;Come in!&quot; Delia called. Tsunade opened the door and stepped into the 
classroom. The students were all sitting down, on their best behavior. 
The new student was standing behind Tsunade, wearing casual jeans and a 
grey shirt with a pair headphones and the word &#39;Salvation&#39; written on 
the shirt.

&quot;IT&#39;S GRANNY TSUNADE!&quot; Naruto shouted out rather loudly, as if he was at 
the opposite end of a football pitch to everyone else.

&quot;Recess is over, Naruto,&quot; Delia informed the loud blonde. &quot;That is no 
way to treat the Principal.&quot;

&quot;Too right it&#39;s not,&quot; Tsunade smirked. &quot;Especially when I am about to 
introduce a transfer student.&quot;

&quot;Oh my god, not another one!&quot; Naruto muttered.

&quot;Yes, Naruto,&quot; Tsunade replied bluntly. &quot;He&#39;s a transfer student, and 
he&#39;s from the USA. He&#39;s here to study in peace, so it&#39;s best to be on 
your best behavior. His name is Eric Hitoshi.&quot; Tsunade paused and looked 
around the class for a couple of seconds. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll leave Eric and the 
rest of the class with you, Mrs Ketchum. Naruto, you&#39;ve got a detention 
with me for disrupting the class.&quot; Tsunade closed the door and left 
abruptly.

&quot;Oh man!&quot; Naruto exclaimed. &quot;Why is it always me?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Cause it&#39;s always you who calls her Granny Tsunade!&quot; Davis announced.

&quot;Why do call her &#39;granny&#39;, anyway?&quot; Delia asked Naruto curiously. &quot;She 
doesn&#39;t look a day over twenty five. &quot;

Kari and Davis, were sitting next to each other, and the transfer 
student was sitting behind them both. Kari looked behind her and smiled 
at Eric. &quot;Hi, Eric, I&#39;m Kari Kamiya, welcome to the class.&quot;

Davis turned around and smiled too. &quot;Hey! I&#39;m Davis, great to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Hi.&quot; Eric replied quickly.

Kari stood up. &quot;Mrs Ketchum, I&#39;ve got an idea I think everyone will 
might like.&quot;

&quot;Go ahead Kari, &quot; Delia said cheerfully. &quot;What is your idea?&quot;

&quot;Well, since we have two new addictions to the class,&quot; Kari stated in an 
enthusiastic tone, &quot;and the news about your son getting a girlfriend. I 
think we should celebrate by having a free lesson. I mean, lets give the 
two new students a good first day.&quot;

&quot;Very thoughtful idea.&quot; Delia thought. &quot;Sure, you can have a free 
lesson. &quot; The class felt quite relieved. &quot;Try not to be too noisy, 
there&#39;s crosswords on the table if anyone wants to try them.&quot; Delia said 
taking sheets of paper from under her desk and placing them on her 
table.
