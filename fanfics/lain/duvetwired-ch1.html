<h1>Duvet of the Wired</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lain/index.html">Serial Experiments Lain</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tenchipachy.html">Tenchi-Pachy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>[This fanfic takes place long after the end of &#39;Serial Experiments 
Lain.&#39; As much as I love the series, I only got around to seeing it 
three times, with long periods of time in between to reflect on it. 
Let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s a confusing story that no matter how hard you try to 
figure it out, there&#39;s always something else that you hadn&#39;t noticed or 
thought of before. It makes &#39;Neon Genesis Evangelion&#39; easier to 
comprehend.

      It was only when I had a friend borrow my &#39;Lain&#39; DVD set that the 
idea of Lain having a split personality disorder ever came up. If you 
had already figured that out the first or second time you watched it, 
then obviously you&#39;re a better thinker than I am. I always thought the 
different Lains were something else, like Lain of the Wired was an 
expression of who Lain is online that she can barely express in the real 
world, like how people who don&#39;t act smart but sound smart when they&#39;re 
writing their thoughts on paper or online (I hope I&#39;m explaining this 
interpretation understandably enough, because otherwise I&#39;m not getting 
further into it). With this new thought in mind, I am not entirely sure 
about the true relation between the two split personalities of Lain; the 
main character we have been following and the snobby biotch that served 
as her outgoing personality. There is also the creepy &#39;peeping tom&#39; 
Lain, but since I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a different Lain altogether or 
where she fits in, I decided to not bother writing her into this fanfic. 
I also have left out Lain&#39;s father-of-the-Wired, since I still don&#39;t 
totally understand that part. Considering all that, this story may not 
be a perfect fit with the context of the original series, but it is 
meant to be a story unto itself, and I hope you enjoy it regardless] 

      The familiar cacophony of cars, people, and light pollution 
commingle in the atmosphere of the city. There is a specific region 
where a bridge is built as an overpass above the main street. Leaning 
against the side of this bridge, looking out, is a little girl dressed 
in a red coat and brown shorts with stockings, with the consistent 
expression of curiosity and kindness. She is the only one who knows her 
name, and she cares to remember it only as a source for 
self-identification in her continuing existence. Her name is Lain.

      For the longest time, Lain has been watching Alice on the street 
from atop this bridge. Lain has always watched her at home and at work, 
not to invade Alice&#39;s privacy but to make sure that Alice is happy with 
her life. Watching her walk up and down the street like another 
pedestrian is Lain&#39;s favorite moment for observation, because it says a 
lot of how Alice feels from the day&#39;s activities. It makes Lain wonder 
what she is thinking about, although she has no intention of directly 
reading Alice&#39;s mind. It would truly be violating Alice without her 
permission, and although she would never know about it, Lain still feels 
it would betray her.

      Lain and Alice were high school students from the same class, and 
Alice was the only friend that consistently socialized with Lain and 
tried to get her to enjoy life. When Lain had told Alice she loved her, 
she meant it. Alice was the only soul above all others that Lain felt 
she could unite herself with rather than just merely &#39;connect&#39; like she 
was with all the other planet&#39;s souls, and that was the true reason why 
Lain did not initially erase Alice&#39;s memories like she did everyone 
else. Lain idealized that as long as she and Alice knew each other 
alone, they would have a world together just for the two of them. But 
Alice misinterpreted Lain&#39;s intentions and reacted with fear and, what 
Lain had felt at the time, disgust at the notion of them being in 
&#39;love.&#39; Masami&#39;s appearance made everything plummet from there, and 
since then Lain decided the best thing was for her to not exist at all. 
Lain was willing to start existence, or reality, whatever you call it, 
all over again so that she would not exist to hurt the one that means 
the most to her. Lain will never forget how she nearly traumatized Alice 
for life for what she put her through.

      Lain thought she would be strong enough to handle it, but she was 
wrong. Even after wiping herself from Alice&#39;s memory, even after Alice 
had found a boyfriend and eventually married him, Lain still loved her. 
When she could not take it anymore, Lain reduced her size down to that 
of a young child, figuring it would be easier that way in coping with 
not having Alice in her life anymore. A child is na&iuml;ve in mind and soul, 
and is not advanced enough to comprehend the pains that a teenager, let 
alone an adult, experiences. Although having the body of a child has 
worked for her for some time, the scars of Lain&#39;s isolation and 
unrequited love still remain impressed on her being, proving that there 
is a self down to her essential level that remains unchanged and defines 
her as the individual, &#39;Lain.&#39;

      She had reunited with Alice once in her child form. Alice seemed 
to have noticed something familiar in Lain, but Lain did not let it get 
too far and just acted like a child paying respects to a stranger. They 
never met face to face ever again, but it did not stop Lain from 
continuing to observe Alice and act as her guardian angel. She does not 
fill the said role efficiently since she cautions herself from coming in 
direct contact with Alice again, lest whatever influence from Lain makes 
everything worse for Alice.

      So far, Lain has done nothing but watch and check up on Alice from 
afar, not having done much else with herself. She has often visited her 
&#39;bedroom&#39; on the Wired and read mountains of books, mostly literary 
classics, literally immersing herself within the worlds written on the 
pages so to go on virtual adventures. In her realm of time and space, it 
is never enough to preoccupy her for too long, especially not to keep 
her mind off of Alice.

      Watching Alice has been Lain&#39;s only source of real comfort, but 
even that has changed lately. On a couple of accidental occasions, Lain 
had witnessed the growing fights between Alice and her husband. During 
her walks to and from work or home, Lain could read the casual distant 
look implanted on her face, and the subtle impatience she shared to any 
pedestrians that walked too close or bumped into her. Lain had no idea 
of what the problem could be, because she had been a child for most of 
the time and could not be able to pick anything up like she used to when 
she wore an older body.

      On this particular day, Alice&#39;s apparent slow gait and expression 
of even deeper pondering has gotten to Lain. Lain wants to discern what 
it could be, but to do that she cannot be a child. She has to change her 
form back to that of a young teenager. No, Alice is an adult now, so 
Lain must change into an adult. She never experienced maturing into 
adulthood, so she would still have more the heart of a teenager, but to 
have an adult&#39;s body would make Lain feel closer to Alice. She realizes 
it means fully regaining her past dreaded feelings, but she will have to 
bear with it for at least a moment; for Alice.

      With a literal blink of her eyes, Lain changes her childish form 
to that of herself as a young adult in a snapshot. She retains the same 
general appearance and clothing, but she feels a little off-balance now 
that she is standing higher up above the ground. She figures to take it 
slowly, and places her hands on the bridge banister to steady herself.

      As expected, her feelings of hurt and pain return with force, but 
she fights against it. Lain looks down at Alice as she walks toward 
underneath the bridge Lain stands upon. Alice is faintly unhappy; that 
much is clear. Looking closer at Alice&#39;s face, Lain can discern the 
inkling of having lost something, or not finding what she wants with 
what she already has. It gives Lain&#39;s mind the concept of a void 
representing something one lost touch with long ago.

      An idea hits Lain. Is Alice thinking about her? Does she still 
remember her? When Lain had reunited with Alice as a child, even then 
Alice displayed a sense of nostalgic d&eacute;j&agrave; vu with her. Lain was not so 
surprised then; although Alice had forgotten her, the impression of Lain 
still remained on her. But Lain never expected to see Alice like she is 
now on this level, constantly thinking about what might be her.

      There can only be one way to find out, and that is to talk to 
Alice herself again. But Lain is afraid of doing so after all this time. 
She does not want to help Alice regain her memories only to possibly 
traumatize her once again, or even to scare her by displaying her 
feelings regardless that they are the same sex. She does not want Alice 
to hate her again either way.

      Instead, Lain runs over to the other side of the bridge and leans 
against it. She hopelessly watches Alice walk through underneath the 
bridge, up the street, and slowly out of sight.

      Then a haunting but beautiful song plays in Lain&#39;s ears from 
nowhere.

      And you don&#39;t seem to understand 
      A shame you seemed an honest man 
      And all the fears you hold so dear 
      Will turn to whisper in your ear

      And you know what they say might hurt you 
      And you know that it means so much 
      And you don&#39;t even feel a thing

      I am falling, I am fading, 
      I have lost it all

      And you don&#39;t seem the lying kind 
      A shame that I can read your mind 
      And all the things that I read there 
      Candle-lit smile that we both share

      And you know I don&#39;t mean to hurt you 
      But you know that it means so much 
      And you don&#39;t even feel a thing

      I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning, 
      Help me to breathe 
      I am hurting, I have lost it all 
      I am losing 
      Help me to breathe

      It takes a while for Lain to realize that the song is coming from 
another person standing next to her. She turns to find what appears like 
a mirror reflection of her adult self, looking out from atop the bridge 
at the fading image of Alice. She is dressed in almost the same clothing 
as Lain herself, except that Lain is wearing a red jacket while her 
&#39;reflection&#39; is wearing a navy jacket. There is something familiar in 
the smile and toned expression of the &#39;reflection,&#39; and it takes Lain a 
moment longer to realize that standing next to her is her other self.

      It is Lain of the Wired, the one that had taken over her body and 
caused problems for her when Lain of the Real World, herself, connected 
with the Wired. Seeing Lain of the Wired once again already suggests 
that her personality has not changed, that she still retains the 
snobbishness inherent within. While Lain was someone who kept to herself 
out of respect to the people around her, Lain of the Wired showed no 
hesitation in expressing her fun and pride even at others&#39; expense when 
she was allowed access to controlling Lain&#39;s body. When other people 
interfered on her fun, Lain of the Wired would react to them like 
parasites, feeling that the world literally centered around her.

      Lain regards the presence of Lain of the Wired with caution, but 
respect all the same. There is no immediate sign of a threat from her, 
but Lain does not want to take chances.

      To her surprise, Lain of the Wired turns to look at her with a 
respectable gaze, and some subtle warmth. She is apparently expecting a 
more welcoming air between the two of them. Lain of the Wired then 
speaks, &quot;That was &#39;Duvet&#39; by Boa. I always loved that song. It reminds 
me of you, therefore I dedicate my performance of it to you.&quot;

      Lain stares in mild confusion. She did not expect something from 
their reunion here, but she did not imagine it being like this. Not 
knowing how else to reply, Lain just gives a respectful nod. &quot;You did 
sing it rather beautifully.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired smiles, with that distinct look in her eyes that 
suggests calculating waylay. &quot;Thank you, but remember. In a way I am 
you, which means you could sing the same way if you tried. But enough of 
that for now. What I&#39;d like to say is; Hello, Lain, long time no see.&quot;

      &quot;Hello.&quot; Many thoughts occur to Lain at once, and she figures that 
she better get down to business so they do not lead each other on. &quot;What 
are you doing here? I thought I had cancelled you out long ago.&quot;

      &quot;You did,&quot; Lain of the Wired said, &quot;However, you cancelled 
yourself out of everyone&#39;s memory and yet you still managed to thrive in 
a plane of existence parallel to that of the real world. I have managed 
to return.&quot;

      &quot;How?&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s because you called for me. It wasn&#39;t conscious on your part, 
but it was still inbuilt, and it was enough to draw me back to you. When 
you changed into an adult, your aura of loneliness sent an 
all-encompassing message for someone to be by your side, and I have come 
to answer, because there is nobody else.&quot;

      Lain wants to change back to child-form again, but something 
prevents her from doing so. It could be because of the overwhelming 
dread that she is not able to concentrate her will at the moment. Or it 
could be because her more mature curiosity has fully ensnared her in the 
moment. Or maybe Lain of the Wired is somehow stopping her against her 
will.

      Her conflicted thinking begins making her tear up. Embarrassed by 
it, she says, &quot;Please go away, I don&#39;t want to see you.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired looks at the image of Alice, still visible from 
the distance as it fades. &quot;It&#39;s painful watching your true love from 
afar but not allowing yourself to relate to her, isn&#39;t it? Why don&#39;t you 
just restart existence again, replace yourself in it, and simply not 
follow the same mistakes that you made before?&quot;

      &quot;After all this time, don&#39;t you think I thought of that already?!&quot; 
Lain snapped. She then pauses and takes a deep breath. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. The 
thing is that I can&#39;t, I just don&#39;t have that power anymore. When Masami 
was God, he was powerful because he had someone believing in him; me. 
When his existence became senseless to me, that&#39;s what destroyed him. I 
had the power to restart time and space because I was endowed with the 
power, and there were people who acknowledged my existence that 
justified that power. Now nobody remembers me, and I don&#39;t have that 
power anymore. I can still cross plane boundaries, change my appearance 
or make myself invisible to everyone at will, but nothing more than 
that.&quot;

      &quot;And yet you still want to be next to Alice, and experience love 
with her.&quot;

      Lain really wants Lain of the Wired to go away, but like she does 
not have the power to turn back time anymore, then neither does she have 
the power to cancel out her other self again. This sudden truth makes 
Lain&#39;s eyes threaten to burst with tears, but they never come out. She 
feels tortured from everything, and especially from Lain of the Wired 
expressing subtle sympathy to her. &quot;What&#39;s it to you anyway? Why are you 
acting like you care?&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m not acting anything. I feel genuine compassion for you,&quot; Lain 
of the Wired said with casualness, nearing closer to Lain, &quot;And that&#39;s 
exactly why I&#39;m here. Lain, you must put Alice out of your mind so that 
you can move on. There are other options in life, and I&#39;m here as one of 
them.&quot;

      Lain expresses puzzlement at what Lain of the Wired is saying, 
almost unaware of her other self&#39;s closer physical proximity.

      Lain of the Wired grasps Lain&#39;s arms. &quot;I am here to be with you, 
Lain. I offer myself for the taking as your new source for experiencing 
spiritual and physical affection. I am here to love you, and hopefully 
have that love returned.&quot;

      Lain backs away in mixed fear, uncertainty, and subtle anger. Her 
angry side wins. &quot;How dare you come talk to me about this, and toying 
with my feelings! You took over my body and my life many times without 
my permission! You were my enemy!&quot;

      The air of Lain of the Wired remains calm, hinting the inner 
arrogance that Lain had known before. Lain of the Wired then says, &quot;Yes, 
I admit we were kind of antagonists. But you must understand, Lain, I 
was *used* by Masami. We were *both* used by him in his ambition to 
change the world. Although I may never have seemed that way to you, I 
felt just as victimized by it all as you were. But it&#39;s all past, Lain, 
those conflicts have long been over and resolved with, one way or 
another. I&#39;m now here offering myself to you as a significant other, and 
I truly mean it. Maybe I don&#39;t come across that way because I have a 
look and mannerism that&#39;s scary to you, but that&#39;s my own personal 
character. I can&#39;t help it anymore than you can help being kind to the 
people you feel close to. I would like us to be together. If you give me 
a chance, I can make you happy.&quot;

      Lain dwells on the words of her other self. Everything she said 
about them being used victims rings true in her ears. There is something 
different about Lain of the Wired as she tries to explain herself, but 
it is still too soon for Lain to believe her when she says she genuinely 
loves her.

      Lain of the Wired gives a calm smile while reaching her arm to 
grasp Lain&#39;s shoulder. Then she leans in next to Lain&#39;s ear, and 
whispers, &quot;I know you&#39;re scared. I know you still love Alice, but you 
must forget her. With the way you are now, there is no way you can 
reunite with her and make her remember you without hurting her again. 
She won&#39;t be able to love you the same way you love her. Only I can love 
you, offer you my soul and my body. Please accept me.&quot;

      Lain can still pick up the sense of high pride in Lain of the 
Wired, but Lain can also sense that she means no wrong to her whatsoever 
in this moment. Lain realizes that she had been studying her other self 
from a conservative perspective that prevented her from seeing her in a 
more positive light. This turning around of thinking and continually 
looking at Lain of the Wired is making Lain feel weak in the knees. She 
turns away from her and looks down at the ground, to make standing up 
much easier. &quot;I really don&#39;t know, Lain of the Wired.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired comes up and hugs her from behind. It is 
unexpected for Lain, but she does not resist against it, since she does 
not feel intentional harm from the contact. Lain of the Wired then rests 
her chin on Lain&#39;s shoulder. She then kisses up the side of Lain&#39;s neck 
while feeling her hands around the flat of Lain&#39;s belly. Sensational 
electric signals transcend through Lain&#39;s being at the physical contact, 
the kind of which she thought she would never experience.

      &quot;Let me in, Lain,&quot; Lain of the Wired said in Lain&#39;s ear, &quot;Please 
take me. Please.&quot;

      Lain finally knows that Lain of the Wired is not toying with her 
emotions. She is being sincere in offering herself. It is true she still 
gives off a somewhat intimidating aura, but that is what defines her as 
her own individual apart from Lain. It is what makes Lain realize that 
they are two different people. Lain pivots her body around until she is 
face to face with Lain of the Wired, and embraces her back.

      &quot;Yes. I accept you.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired then guides Lain&#39;s face to hers with her 
fingertips and locks lips with her. This becomes an entirely new 
sensation for what feels like an hour. It is one that Lain also never 
gave any thought of experiencing, and now she wonders why that was so. 
After it finishes, they then just stand there on the bridge in their 
embrace.

      Lain of the Wired says, &quot;Thank you, Lain. I was afraid you 
wouldn&#39;t accept me. I had been lonely since our last encounter.&quot; Before 
Lain can say anything to that, Lain of the Wired says, &quot;But I forgive 
you, the same that you have forgiven me now, and we can be one in due 
time.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you, Lain of the Wired,&quot; Lain said, and then pauses. &quot;What 
do I call you?&quot;

      &quot;You can just call me your Other Self, because I am you, but you 
are the original Lain, so therefore I will call you Lain.&quot;

      &quot;Okay.&quot; A long moment of silence is shared, before Lain says, 
almost chuckling, &quot;I have managed to perform deeds that defied space and 
time, and yet I have no idea of how to take this from here.&quot;

      Lain of the Wires smiles. &quot;I&#39;d like it if we had a proper 
relationship, instead of going straight to the point if you know what I 
mean. By a proper relationship, I mean let&#39;s go on a date together.&quot;

      &quot;A date?&quot; Lain ponders on it for a moment. &quot;I never really looked 
into how a date works, except that it involves a couple going to 
dinner.&quot;

      &quot;Have you ever watched Anime at all? A date is where a couple 
would spend the entire day just hanging out walking around shopping 
squares and such. I know just the places to go too, so how does that 
sound?&quot;

      &quot;Would we be traveling in the Wired, or are we talking about...&quot;

      &quot;The real world, of course. Hasn&#39;t it been a long time since you 
were a part of this world, Lain? It has for me, and I don&#39;t know about 
you but I&#39;ve missed it. If we go together, we&#39;ll both remember how 
exciting it was to be mortal humans.&quot;

      &quot;Well, we might also remember the pains our humanities had brought 
us.&quot;

      &quot;If you keep your mind in a negative state, then you&#39;re not going 
to be able to move forward into anything at all. It&#39;ll be scary, you may 
feel a little awkward, but I&#39;ll be there to support you the whole way. I 
guarantee you&#39;ll adjust in no time.&quot;

      Lain still looks uncertain, so Lain of the Wires places her hands 
on Lain&#39;s shoulders and says, &quot;Please promise me that you&#39;ll never 
change back to your child-form ever again.&quot; Lain tries responding, but 
she continues, saying, &quot;You were indeed a cute kid, but you&#39;re beautiful 
the way you are now. I want us to face the world together, Lain, as 
mature people this time around. No matter what unfavorable surprise or 
pain you may feel, never revert back to a child. It shows that you&#39;re 
not willing to take a little roughing in order to grow up and survive. 
Let&#39;s not be like that. Concentrate with me, and we can both become 
adults, not just in bodies but in spirits as well.&quot; Lain of the Wired 
steps back and offers her hand. &quot;Can we do it?&quot;

      Lain looks at the hand, then at Lain of the Wired, who smiles in a 
fashion that suggests maturity higher than that of Lain&#39;s. Lain then 
manages to smile back, gives a nod, and takes her hand.

      &quot;That&#39;s my girl,&quot; Lain of the Wired said.

      Lain and Lain of the Wired then walk hand-in-hand down from the 
bridge and toward the local shopping square.

      &quot;So what are the places that you want us to go?&quot; Lain asked.

      &quot;First off we&#39;re going to visit this fashion clothing store I&#39;ve 
looked up on, so we can finally ditch these Plain-Jane outfits of ours. 
You&#39;re beautiful, Lain. I know that, and it&#39;s no secret. You need to 
wear something to clarify your beauty, as well as mine. We need to wear 
something that symbolizes our newfound outgoing spirits.&quot;

      Lain is a little anxious at the idea. But the appearance of her 
other self in her life again has brought about an entire new chapter she 
never expected. With the way things are proceeding now, she figures she 
will flow along with it and see how it goes. &quot;Okay.&quot;

      &quot;Great! Follow me.&quot; 

      After two hours of rooting through ABe Clothing Home, Lain and 
Lain of the Wired come out donned with new attire. Lain felt diffident 
at many of the suggestions and options that Lain of the Wired proffered. 
She obviously wanted Lain to come off as more risqu&eacute; than she was really 
willing. In the end, Lain settles for blue jeans, a white tank top, and 
many bands decorating her wrists and belt. Lain of the Wired settles for 
low baggy army pants that reach just below her knees, while also 
decorated with some of the same bands that Lain is wearing along with a 
choker around her neck. Her most illuminating apparel is her 
loose-fitting black half-tank top, giving the world a decent view of her 
belly. Lain takes a gander at the appearance of Lain of the Wired, and 
cannot help but feel aroused by her astonishing sexiness.

      &quot;You look great, Lain,&quot; Lain of the Wired said. She then places 
her hands on her bare hips, while conveniently leaning to one side, 
virtually posing her abs to Lain. &quot;Do you have anything to say to me?&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re very beautiful,&quot; Lain said.

      &quot;Well thank you. There&#39;s another place I&#39;d like us to go, but is 
there anyplace you had in mind?&quot;

      &quot;Not really...although a walk through the streets would be nice. 
We could go hand-in-hand if you want...&quot;

      &quot;So you&#39;d like us to display our closeness to the public already?&quot;

      &quot;Well, no, that&#39;s not what I...&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m kidding, Lain! Now that I&#39;m here, now that we&#39;re both back 
here in this world, you should learn to lighten up.&quot;

      Lain laughs a little. &quot;Sure.&quot;

      &quot;Let&#39;s go for that walk first then.&quot;

      Lain and Lain of the Wired then stroll through the city that was 
once their original home, hand-in-hand. They look at the various sights 
that they have not appreciated before without saying much, including the 
local cherry blossom park. The surrounding pedestrians give some curious 
glances, but none give any stares that Lain half-expected. She is 
feeling self-conscious from it all, but then she realizes she must not 
let it get the best of her. With Lain of the Wired by her side, so close 
to her the way she is, Lain feels very safe doing anything in this 
world.

      After spending a whole afternoon into the evening on their walk, 
Lain of the Wired has them come to a stop. She looks to the side and 
says, &quot;Here&#39;s the place I recommend.&quot;

      Lain looks in the same direction and discerns a familiar building 
with the huge sign &#39;Cyberia&#39; in front. No dread returns to Lain, but she 
feels uncomfortable all the same.

      &quot;You up for it?&quot; Lain of the Wired asked.

      &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

      &quot;Why&#39;s that? I thought you liked this place too.&quot;

      &quot;I *used* to like it, yes, but that was a long time ago. It was 
before I found out it was one of the many sources of my troubles.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re hesitant in going in there because you think it would be 
connected to and  bring back painful memories?&quot;

      Lain nods.

      Lain of the Wired offers a smile. &quot;It&#39;s like you said, it was a 
long time ago. Think of it this way. Many people thought their high 
school years sucked, and would do anything to avoid their old campus. 
But when they revisit it, they are struck by a weird sense of nostalgia. 
They realize that what took place there is really distant due to where 
they&#39;re at now. If you come in with me, Lain, I promise I&#39;ll give you 
the time of your life. You won&#39;t be able to think of all the negative 
aspects of Cyberia. I&#39;ve always known you to be brave.&quot;

      Lain is silent for the moment. &quot;I was brave because I was intent 
on looking for something, or I had something to hold onto.&quot; She looks up 
at Lain of the Wired, cupping her cheek with her hand. &quot;With you by me, 
I believe you.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s the spirit, girl!&quot; Lain of the Wired said, patting Lain 
hard on the back.

      Walking into Cyberia does bring back some of the unfavorable, 
painful memories to Lain. But this pain, in a strange way, lets her know 
that she is alive, and she has a life to experience. She also notices 
the many clubbers dancing around her, having their own personal fun in 
this place that was meant for such an occasion.

      Lain and Lain of the Wired order drinks at the bar, but Lain of 
the Wired barely downs a quarter of her glass before she, rather 
impatiently, heads onto the dance floor. Lain watches her other self 
move to the techno-rhythm, observing how carefree she is dressed in her 
apparel. She blends in easily with the other dancers who are clad almost 
similarly, so she does not provide much of a distraction to anyone else. 
Lain then wonders how she would dance, not remembering having ever tried 
it before. She hesitates from doing so now because she does not feel 
like someone who would up and jump at the deep end, with everything 
being so new to her at this point.

      &quot;Is that your sister dancing over there?&quot; a young-sounding male 
voice asked.

      Lain turns to see a rather short, unfamiliar man with a bald head 
donned by a fake Mohawk. He gives off the impression of someone who&#39;s 
friendly and willing to mess around with people.

      &quot;No, not really,&quot; Lain said.

      &quot;Seriously? She looks a lot like you, it&#39;s scary.&quot; He turns to 
face Lain. &quot;I don&#39;t remember seeing you before. On the other hand, I&#39;m 
new here myself. I&#39;m still breaking in after getting a job here.&quot;

      &quot;Really?&quot; Although Lain had never before met this man, she feels 
like she could socialize with him in a friendly manner

      &quot;My friends call me GA, by the way.&quot;

      &quot;GA, huh? I never heard that kind of name before.&quot;

      &quot;GA is a play on JJ, the guy who used to work here.&quot;

      &quot;Oh yeah, I knew him once.&quot;

      &quot;You did? What a small world.&quot;

      &quot;My name&#39;s Lain.&quot;

      GA reaches his hand over, which Lain shakes. Before either can say 
anything else, a voice cuts in, blurting, &quot;*What* do you think you&#39;re 
*doing*?&quot;

      Lain turns to see Lain of the Wired standing firm with hands on 
hips, her eyes looking daggers straight at GA.

      A little startled, GA said, &quot;I was saying hello&#151;&quot;

      &quot;So you could invite her to your place, right? Get real, because 
she belongs to me!&quot;

      GA&#39;s eyes frown in confusion, then widen as he does a take back 
and forth between Lain and Lain of the Wired, apparently getting the 
gist of what she is saying. &quot;Oh,&quot; he manages to say.

      &quot;Feeling aroused? Too bad, because I don&#39;t appreciate you getting 
up on our...&quot;

      &quot;Stop!&quot; Lain said.

      Lain of the Wired looks at Lain, apparently taken aback by her 
sudden demand.

      Lain stops and makes herself calm before saying, &quot;We were just 
introducing ourselves, honey, we were just saying hello. GA is a nice 
man, really.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired continues peering at Lain, before turning back 
to GA, her remnant scowl still apparent. &quot;I apologize for jumping the 
gun on you. But I would trust you more if you weren&#39;t so &#39;nice&#39; with her 
behind my back.&quot;

      &quot;Hey, no problem,&quot; GA said, assuring, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean any harm. Are 
you two going to come back at all after tonight?&quot;

      &quot;Maybe we will,&quot; Lain of the Wired said, almost distant.

      &quot;I would love to,&quot; Lain said, grasping the hand of her other self.

      &quot;Okay, well, I&#39;ll see you around the next time you come. I got 
work to do now, so I need to go anyway. Sorry for the trouble.&quot;

      &quot;You weren&#39;t any trouble at all,&quot; Lain said, who then feels the 
grip of Lain of the Wired tighten. As soon as GA leaves, Lain turns to 
her other self. &quot;Nothing happened, honey. Nothing was going on between 
us.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired sighs, looks at her from the corner of her eye, 
and smiles a little. &quot;I couldn&#39;t really tell from where I saw you, the 
way you were smiling as you conversed with this guy, and touching his 
hand. This is your first day out in the real world, and you&#39;re already 
getting along with a total stranger. I feel like if I don&#39;t keep my 
grasp on you you&#39;ll slip away from me.&quot;

      Lain takes a hold of the arms of Lain of the Wired. &quot;I promised 
you I would be with you. I wouldn&#39;t betray you like that. I give you my 
word. The next time we come, please be nice to GA. He could be a new 
friend for us.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ll try, but I&#39;d like it a lot better if it was just the two of 
us for each other.&quot; The expression of Lain of the Wired remains 
unchanged, but a tear is seen streaking down her one eye.

      &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; Lain asked, amazed by the sight.

      &quot;You called me &#39;honey,&#39;&quot; Lain of the Wired said, smiling, &quot;It made 
me very happy.&quot;

      Lain nods in mild surprise, smiling back. After a while of 
silence, she asks, &quot;Did you have fun on the dance floor?&quot;

      &quot;Did I ever! I haven&#39;t done that like in ages! Come on, Lain, when 
are you going to come join me?&quot;

      &quot;Maybe a little later?&quot;

      Lain of the Wired smiles. &quot;It&#39;s okay. We&#39;re going to be together 
for a long time. We might as well take our baby steps. But next time we 
come, namely tomorrow, I expect you to be by my side on the floor.&quot;

      &quot;Sure.&quot; 

      Later that night, Lain and Lain of the Wired decide to finally 
turn in. As they exit Cyberia, Lain of the Wired asks, &quot;So, where do you 
sleep?&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t &#39;sleep&#39; per se, and haven&#39;t done so in a long time,&quot; Lain 
said.

      &quot;Obviously it&#39;s time we started the habit again.&quot;

      &quot;Well, I do have a retreat within the Wired that I designed after 
my original bedroom.&quot;

      &quot;Let&#39;s go there, then.&quot;

      With the blink of Lain&#39;s eyes, they come across a door in between 
planes of the real world and the Wired. They enter Lain&#39;s room, the bed 
in plain sight, and then Lain looks at Lain of the Wired. Although 
Lain&#39;s eyes were off of her for only a moment, Lain of the Wired is 
mystically stripped of all her clothing except for a pastel undershirt 
and panties.

      Lain of the Wired smiles her devious smile, although with a more 
friendly aura. &quot;You know what I&#39;m thinking about, Lain.&quot;

      Lain looks away, her face flushed, a loss for words at the moment. 
&quot;Remember, baby steps, right?&quot;

      &quot;Oh come *on*, do we have to take baby steps for *everything*? Oh 
fine, just as long as I get to kiss you goodnight and hold you.&quot; Warmth 
envelops Lain. Sensing this, Lain of the Wired says, &quot;Believe me, Lain, 
it makes sleeping more luxurious.&quot;

      Lain looks down at herself. Whether it was by her will or by that 
of her other self, she also is wearing nothing more than a kinky 
undershirt and panties. Paying no further mind to it, they hold and kiss 
each other for a long moment, then they crawl onto the bed in unison. 
They align in a spooning position, with Lain of the Wired in the back 
and Lain in the front. Just like Lain of the Wired said, their embrace 
in bed is making her feel more tender and wholesome. She never imagined 
sharing this with her other self. She did dream of the possibility of 
sharing it with...

      Lain immediately pushes the thought from her mind. She had too 
much fun tonight, she wants to continue having fun, and she is tired 
right now. With Lain of the Wired breathing softly upon her neck, Lain 
slowly succumbs to sleep for the first time in what feels like ages. 

      Upon the second night of visiting Cyberia, Lain tries herself out 
on the dance floor along with Lain of the Wired. It is initially slow 
for her, but due to the coaxing demands of her other self, Lain gets 
filled with adrenaline and eventually just goes crazy along with her. 
Lain never feels as alive as she had before right then.

      Lain and Lain of the Wired continue dating in the days that 
follow. Instead of visiting the same city that Lain had always known, 
they are able to visit various random locations all over planet Earth 
through portals provided by the Wired, seeing the sights of Africa, the 
USA, China and the like. Lain is perplexed that she had not thought of 
doing this before when she was alone to occupy her time. On the other 
hand, her trips in catching the many sights the real world has to offer 
with another person makes it all the more fun for her. They would mostly 
visit cities, because Lain had always felt comfortable being surrounded 
by tall shelter structures that extended toward the heavens, rather than 
the open countryside of environments where she feels more exposed to all 
of existence. Although Lain never asks, she can sense that her other 
self feels the same way.

      One of the two things that remain constant on their outgoing 
ventures is their clothing. Somehow it just feels right to Lain to wear 
what she does, and she does not bother imagining otherwise. Lain of the 
Wired voices that Lain should be more daring and tries coaxing her to 
acquire a half-tank top like her. After a while, Lain resolves to wear a 
shorter top that shows up to her navel, which suffices them both.

      The other regular thing, the one place that they always return to 
every night, is Cyberia. There are several thousands of dance clubs to 
sample in the world, but Cyberia is the one place that makes them feel 
at home in this global world that they have been exploring. If they were 
to consider all options in the expansion of existence, they would feel 
lost as to where to go. To visit Cyberia alone makes them feel more 
grounded in place so that they do not stray so far in their ventures.

      Due to their frequent visits to Cyberia, they gradually become 
well known by the other clubbers. The intimate dancing of Lain and Lain 
of the Wired would grab the attention of the surrounding dancers, the 
men especially. It is because of their frequent clubbing that Cyberia is 
gradually becoming more and more popular. The club has started 
establishing lines for people to wait in outside for as long as an hour. 
If anything, the presence of the two halves of Lain makes the dance club 
more exhilarating for the surrounding clubbers. Lain and Lain of the 
Wired got to acquaint with most of the other clubbers, and hear 
interesting stories they have to say about their lives.

      Many of the clubbers offer to dance with them. Some are ladies, 
which Lain of the Wired readily accepts, and Lain follows suit. Any men 
that offer to dance with Lain of the Wired and do not back down from her 
initial rejection would receive fits from her and threats to get lost. 
Lain tries to soothe her, and much to her surprise Lain of the Wired 
yields and even apologizes to the male clubbers. Lain knows that if she 
was not there by her side, it would have been a different story. 

      One night, Lain and Lain of the Wired stand atop a mountain 
plateau outside of the city, simply looking at the stars.

      Lain says, &quot;I don&#39;t understand why you can&#39;t be more flexible with 
the men at Cyberia. We&#39;ve always been cutting loose and having fun for 
the heck of it without any harm done.&quot;

      &quot;I know, but what we&#39;ve been doing is different for me. I just 
can&#39;t be intimate with a guy; I get nauseated with him after a while. 
They just don&#39;t give off the same vibe that another woman does. A Woman 
is softer, and far cozier than a man could be.&quot; Saying that, Lain of the 
Wired snuggles her head against the hair of Lain&#39;s, who sighs at the 
contact. She continues, &quot;I&#39;m surprised that you can warm up to them so 
easily when I can&#39;t. On the other hand, didn&#39;t you date a guy before?&quot;

      &quot;That was so I could get information out of him. He left off 
rather rudely by &#39;kissing&#39; gum into my mouth.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s men for you.&quot;

      &quot;But women can be just as tricky too.&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, well, whatever.&quot;

      A moment of silence, and then Lain chuckles.

      &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Lain of the Wired asked.

      &quot;Don&#39;t you remember the lyrics from &#39;Duvet&#39;? *And you don&#39;t seem 
to understand, a shame you seemed to be an honest man*. You say that 
song reminds you of me, and yet it&#39;s singed in a way like it&#39;s a woman 
dedicating it to a man!&quot;

      Lain of the Wired rolls her eyes. &quot;Songs are like poems; they can 
be interpreted any which way. I feel that that&#39;s the way you and I are 
in a lot of aspects, especially our histories. Besides, ignoring that 
one detail in the song about a &#39;man&#39;, whatever this &#39;man&#39; stands for, it 
still reminds me of you. That one word means nothing to me. Besides, I 
didn&#39;t write that song, Boa did.&quot;

      &quot;Whatever happened to that band anyway?&quot; Lain asked, &quot;They&#39;re so 
good.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired smiles. &quot;I agree, but I don&#39;t know, to be 
honest. Anyway, speaking of music, Cyberia is getting kind of boring 
lately.&quot;

      Lain looks at her in astonishment. &quot;You&#39;re saying you want to 
sample other clubs?&quot;

      Lain of the Wired laughs. &quot;No, that&#39;s not what I meant. Cyberia&#39;s 
in need of new techno-tunes. Whoever the DJ is, he or she isn&#39;t coming 
out with much new material. Hey, I got an idea! We don&#39;t have a job at 
all here in the real world! Why don&#39;t we apply as DJs at Cyberia?&quot;

      Lain gives a blank stare.

      &quot;We have been through the Wired. We have gained knowledge from 
every nook and cranny of connected forms in existence. We know almost 
everything there is about sound-suffusion and how music can trigger the 
bodily senses. By putting our heads together, I believe you and I could 
construct something new all the time, music that people will hardly ever 
expect or imagine. What&#39;s more, I think it&#39;ll give them a blast! So what 
do you say?&quot;

      &quot;Wow,&quot; Lain said, &quot;I never thought of something like this.&quot; She 
turns away, looking at the stars. She smiles, looks at Lain of the 
Wired, and says, &quot;I think we can do it, so yes!&quot;

      &quot;Great!&quot; Lain of the Wired then offers her hand, saying, &quot;May I 
have this dance?&quot;

      Lain takes her hand, and they waltz together atop the moonlit 
plateau.

      Lain of the Wired sings, &quot;And you don&#39;t seem to understand, a 
shame you seemed an honest man...&quot;

      Lain chimes in, &quot;And all the fears you hold so dear, will turn to 
whisper in your ear...&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s it, Lain!&quot; Lain of the Wired said, before taking her turn 
in the verse.

      Their mutual chorus carries their dance on throughout the night. 

      The next evening, Lain and Lain of the Wired arrive at Cyberia, 
greeted by the usual kind welcomes from almost everyone. Lain sees GA, 
walks up to him, and says, &quot;Hey, GA, what&#39;s up? I was wondering if you 
could tell us who the main DJ is here.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re looking at him,&quot; GA said, &quot;I took over from JJ 
specifically.&quot;

      Lain is fairly surprised by this. She looks to Lain of the Wired, 
who is even more baffled.

      &quot;What can I do for you?&quot; GA asked.

      Before Lain can speak, Lain of the Wired says, &quot;First of all, I&#39;m 
sorry for the attitude I shared with you. I was jumping to conclusions 
that night, and I just...&quot;

      &quot;You seriously love and care for her, I understand,&quot; GA said, &quot;No 
hard feelings.&quot;

      &quot;Good,&quot; Lain of the Wired said. She looks to Lain.

      Lain takes her queue. &quot;We would like to apply as DJs here. If you 
give us a chance, I believe we&#39;ll surprise you.&quot;

      Before long the jobs of being the DJs of Cyberia are theirs. For 
the first time, Lain has assimilated with the real world on the level of 
careering, and is contributing something to the surrounding people. The 
beats that she and her other self conceive become gradual hits to the 
club&#39;s attendees. Like Lain of the Wired said, they manage to produce 
sounds nobody ever expected, but their bodies gradually become 
accustomed to the newfound rhythms. Lain and Lain of the Wired would 
often either work together or switch shifts, but they would always find 
a moment to meet each other on the dance floor and move to their own 
music, together, not caring of the show they are giving to the 
surrounding dancers. Upon every visit to Cyberia, Lain of the Wired 
would coax Lain to dance with her in more audacious, grinding fashions. 
After a while GA warns them to watch themselves from going too far, 
otherwise the club would go out of control. Lain of the Wired is 
disappointed, but she concedes. 

      After a while, when Lain and Lain of the Wired turn in to their 
online bedroom, Lain takes one long gaze into the eyes of her other 
self, and something new clicks within her. Without awareness, their lips 
meet, and they manually help each other&#39;s clothes come off instead of 
just willing them off.

      &quot;Wait, wait!&quot; Lain of the Wired said, stopping their moment, &quot;What 
about birth control?&quot;

      &quot;Oh, right,&quot; Lain said, quickly patting the pockets in her 
clothing.

      It takes her a full couple seconds to realize that Lain of the 
Wired was fooling around with her. Lain looks up at her other self, who 
bursts into wicked giggles. Lain merely smiles, pushes Lain of the Wired 
onto the bed and climbs on after her. They sprawl about comfortably and 
connect the whole night.

      For the longest time Lain wanted to undergo love on the human 
level, but had no other Form or Being to do so with. Although she never 
consciously realized it at the time, this was the same reason she took 
the defense against Masami as to why people had bodies. As human beings 
residing in the material realm of reality, the only way two souls can 
ever really touch each other is through sex, which Lain feels is truly 
heaven on earth. If she had chosen the path as a goddess and left her 
body permanently, if she were to draw all other living souls to do the 
same, they would have assimilated and that would have been the only kind 
of &#39;connection&#39;. Lain does not believe it would give the same 
experience; only physical bodies can provide the sensational electric 
signals that can reach the soul within. 

      A whole week passes as they undergo the same routine. They explore 
someplace, take their shifts at Cyberia and visit the dance floor, then 
they would retreat and make love, with newer techniques each night as 
suggested by Lain of the Wired.

      As Lain analyzes the time they spent together, she realizes that, 
although she does not understand why, even with all their relishing 
passion, Lain does not feel like baring her entire soul to her other 
self. They always come close to spiritual contact, but Lain feels like 
pulling back and just letting the physical pleasure dominate the senses 
for her lover. She subconsciously figures that it must be because she 
wants to save their peak at the most special moment, which could be 
reserved for another night. She does not have time to think about it 
when they are doing it, and when it is all over she loses her 
contemplation and just relieves herself to the moment and forgets about 
it. She does not consider it a real problem, for she values her time 
with Lain of the Wired and puts it aside.

      This night becomes different for some reason. Lain lays awake by 
herself, reminiscing on her time spent with her other self.

      Although Lain of the Wired was practically her enemy, it was 
indeed a long time ago and it has changed into a different world by now. 
Lain does not know if she is going to biologically grow older along with 
her lover like a normal human being, but that is a thought for another 
day. It all makes her reminisce back to the time when she was an unwary 
girl whose powers had not yet been tapped or exposed, when she had gone 
to high school, and interact or did not interact with everyone. She 
feels like she was so young and na&iuml;ve back then, long before who she is 
now. There are so many possibilities of what could have happened in her 
life&#39;s existence instead, and...

      Alice&#39;s face flashes across Lain&#39;s mind&#39;s eye.

      Lain realizes she had been keeping Alice locked in the back of her 
mind all this time, like a bird one could see through the window from 
the corner of one&#39;s eye and cannot ignore. Confusion and muddling 
overtakes Lain&#39;s mind, conflicting her thoughts. She does not understand 
why, but she suddenly feels the need to be by herself, otherwise Lain of 
the Wired would sense her dilemma and ask about it. She would not know 
how to explain something she barely understands herself. To isolate 
herself would help her think more clearly.

      She slowly creeps out of the bed, careful not to rouse Lain of the 
Wired awake. With the blink of her eyes, her clothes are on. Before she 
can reach the door, she hears a mumbled voice saying, &quot;Where you going, 
Lain? Surely not to the bathroom?&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about stuff, and,&quot; Lain stops herself, shaking 
her head. &quot;I just feel like going out for a walk. I&#39;ll be back shortly.&quot;

      &quot;Okay, just so as long you don&#39;t cheat on me while you&#39;re out.&quot;

      Lain manages a chuckle. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; 

      Lain strolls down the walkway next to the city&#39;s cherry blossom 
park. She catches the time from the huge clock that hangs off the side 
of one of the city&#39;s buildings, which reads 4:00 in the morning. She had 
no idea of the time she spent with Lain of the Wired, and how early it 
already is into the next day that she feels the need to leave her other 
self and go for a walk of reflection.

      Lain does not understand why now of all times, but her thoughts 
are monopolized by Alice. She remembers the one person who she had first 
fallen in love with, who made her fantasize what her life could have 
been like if she had spent it with a significant other. She remembers 
constantly watching Alice from afar that ended just a week ago at the 
arrival of Lain of the Wired; it feels like such a long time already. 
She loves the touch, feel and company of Lain of the Wired, and is happy 
with what she offers her. But now she cannot stop thinking about her 
other object of affection. Lain realizes that Alice is the reason why 
she had unconsciously restrained herself during her nights with Lain of 
the Wired. Lain wants to stay with her other self, but she cannot stop 
thinking of the possibility of finally seeing Alice again, if only for a 
moment. She does not know what she would say; it would probably be best 
if she put it aside again...

      Before Lain knows it, she sees Alice sitting on one of the swings 
in the small playground next to the park up ahead. Lain had not planned 
to see Alice, had not prepared for the possibility, and yet there she is 
in the pathway Lain was taking as she was examining her thoughts.

      Lain does not know what to do. She is not one to immediately think 
that this is fate, anymore than it is coincidence. Lain is all by 
herself without her lover, and from what she can see, Alice is all by 
herself without her husband. Lain walks closer, and notices that Alice&#39;s 
expression is of that of deep thought again, as if lost in her own 
pondering. There is something especially nostalgic with the idea of 
talking to Alice again, almost similar to when Lain returned to Cyberia, 
but Alice is still far different from that.

      Lain continues walking in Alice&#39;s direction, and she soon wonders 
if it is against her will or if she is acting on her impulses. As she 
draws nearer, she tries searching out the bright side of the situation, 
the reason justifying her coming interface with Alice. Alice was a dear 
friend of Lain&#39;s who meant the world to her. Lain is not going out of 
her way to rekindle a potential relationship with her; she meant it when 
she said she would not betray Lain of the Wired. Instead this is an 
opportunity to just socialize with Alice after all this time, and find 
out once and for all how she is faring from her life.

      Lain then realizes that she really does not know how to approach 
Alice. It is not like Alice would easily pick up a conversation with 
someone who is a total stranger to her. On the other hand, it is odd 
that Alice would be out here so early in the morning all by herself. 
Lain can just make herself come across as a morning jogger who just 
happened to bump into Alice. That would definitely work.

      Getting into the act, Lain breaks into a jog in Alice&#39;s direction, 
but does not face her at first. From the corner of her eye, when she 
sees Alice looking up, Lain then slows down to a walking gait before a 
complete stop, a couple yards in front from where Alice sits. &quot;Hey, good 
morning to you,&quot; Lain said, improvising her character on the spot, &quot;I 
don&#39;t see too many other people outdoors the same time as me.&quot;

      &quot;Oh really?&quot; Alice said, &quot;I didn&#39;t realize it was that early.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s nice to see someone else out here at this time,&quot; Lain said, 
&quot;Do you mind a little company?&quot;

      Alice just looks at Lain with a somewhat spellbound gaze, making 
Lain fear that she is coming on too strongly too soon. Then she 
remembers she is wearing her tank top and blue jeans. Along with the way 
she is already talking, she must come across as some kind of rebel punk 
to Alice.

      Lain softens her disposition and says more gently, &quot;It&#39;s just that 
I don&#39;t meet too many people out here. I like company sometimes, even 
with nice-looking people I just met.&quot;

      Alice gives a faint smile. &quot;Sure. You could sit down if you wish.&quot;

      Taking her queue, Lain takes her seat on the low swing next to 
Alice. Both sit in silence for the moment. Lain can hardly breathe now 
that she is finally talking to Alice again.

      Alice does not say anything, so Lain casually says, &quot;So, what 
brings you out here so early? Do you like to exercise like I do?&quot;

      &quot;No, not really,&quot; Alice said, distant, as if calculating what she 
should say to her unofficial newfound friend, &quot;I just have a lot on my 
mind, and it helps that I just leave on my own for a while to reflect. 
I&#39;m not sure if that makes sense to you or not.&quot;

      &quot;Actually, I think I know what you mean. You have a lot going on 
at home?&quot; Lain then shakes her head and says, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, that was 
getting too personal. It&#39;s a bad habit of mine.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Alice said, then asks, &quot;Do you have someone close to 
you in your life?&quot;

      Curious of the new question, Lain answers, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;

      &quot;Does he make you happy?&quot;

      Lain feels awkward at the presumed gendered pronoun. Not knowing 
how to bend around the question, she manages to say, &quot;Well, my lover is 
really...&quot;

      &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Alice said, covering her mouth and laughing, 
apparently getting Lain&#39;s gist, &quot;I didn&#39;t realize. Now here *I* am 
feeling awkward!&quot;

      &quot;So that doesn&#39;t bother you?&quot;

      &quot;I used to be freaked out by this kind of thing, when I was 
younger. At my age now, I realize that love is love. When you connect 
with another human being on a spiritual level, that is pure magick, 
whether it&#39;s with someone of the opposite or same sex.&quot;

      Lain feels some relief from hearing this. Alice had clearly 
changed since when she was a teenager.

      &quot;My time with my lover is indeed magickal,&quot; Lain said, &quot;It&#39;s 
because of her I am able to live a life in this world. That&#39;s what you 
have, right? A magickal love?&quot;

      Alice pauses. &quot;Well, yes, I do. I love him...well, I don&#39;t know 
how to explain. It&#39;s very complicated. Your answer might be &#39;no,&#39; but 
did you ever have the feeling that although you&#39;re with the person you 
believe you&#39;re destined to be with, there&#39;s still a void in you?&quot;

      Lain brightens her eyes at this, already hoping where this 
conversation is going. &quot;Kind of. What sort of void?&quot;

      Alice pauses for a bit. &quot;People who unknowingly have had a sex 
operation when they were hermaphroditic babies know that something was 
taken away from them even though their parents never told them the 
truth, and for that reason they grow up unhappy. Well, it&#39;s just that I 
felt something was taken away from me, that I had lost touch with 
something that defined me from my past. I don&#39;t know what it could be. 
It could be an object, an animal, it could be another person...or it 
could just be a feeling in my mind, plain and simple. I don&#39;t know what 
it is. I went to see a couple psychiatrists to help me out, a couple 
psychics even, but none of them could provide any answers for me. I know 
I lost something. I can&#39;t help but feel that whatever it is, it&#39;s always 
been near me but was never in my reach. I don&#39;t know how to describe it, 
but I&#39;ve always had this nagging sense that this something has been 
*watching* over me my whole life, but I&#39;m never aware of what that is. 
My husband was someone that I had admired since my childhood, because he 
was once a teacher at my old school. I thought I had everything when we 
got together, but now I&#39;m not sure anymore. The problem is that I can&#39;t 
believe I&#39;m totally happy with the person I&#39;m with now unless I have 
regained what I lost. What I&#39;m afraid of is, if that lost something is 
another person, and it was someone I had possibly loved or had close 
feelings for, what if my love that defines my happiness shifted away 
from my husband and onto that other person? I would be a terrible human 
being.&quot;

      Lain is almost ashamed at the fact that Alice&#39;s personal distress 
is uplifting her own spirits. Like Lain had concluded before, although 
she had erased herself from Alice&#39;s memories, the impression of her 
still remains. Even though Lain had never shown herself to Alice, Alice 
had always subconsciously known that Lain had been looking after her. 
That can only mean that Alice still feels a deep connection of some kind 
to her; what specific kind it is is hard to discern at the moment.

      Lain shakes her head to get back on track with their conversation. 
&quot;Well, you have to do what you feel or think is right. You need to take 
the people around you into consideration too, but...&quot; Lain sighs, &quot;I 
really don&#39;t know what to say that could help you.&quot;

      Alice then gives Lain an inquiring peer, as if looking for 
something.

      &quot;Do I have something on my face?&quot; Lain asked.

      &quot;No, but...could you stand up for a  minute?&quot;

      Lain does so, and Alice stands up in front of her, taking a couple 
steps back to have a better look, her eyes peering at Lain up and down. 
She finally says, &quot;Have we met before?&quot;

      Lain tries to answer but nothing comes out. She did not expect 
this so soon.

      &quot;It&#39;s just that I&#39;m having a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. I remember feeling 
this before, when I talked to a cute little girl on a street bridge. You 
look a lot like her, now that I think about it, except you&#39;re tall, and 
very beautiful...&quot;

      Lain blushes in an instant and fidgets her hands a little.

      &quot;Oh, I&#39;m not trying to flirt with you or anything, I just...let me 
start over. You look a lot like this girl I had met. When I talked with 
her, that was the first time I felt like I was reconnecting with 
something. But with what, I had no idea. There was something nice about 
her and I wanted to keep talking to her, but she did not want to speak 
with me too much more. Ever since then, I knew I had lost something. I 
wanted to see that girl again, but I never did. And yet, for some 
reason, I felt that girl&#39;s presence all the time like a ghost. I felt 
the same kind of presence when you came along, although I didn&#39;t mention 
it earlier. I really wasn&#39;t sure if I was imagining anything at the 
time. It&#39;s just...what am I saying? It&#39;s not like you&#39;re that same girl, 
or that you&#39;re her older sister, that would be too much of a 
convenience. I really don&#39;t know where I&#39;m trying to go with this, so 
I&#39;m sorry, forget it.&quot;

      Lain realizes this is her one chance, although doubt commingles 
within her mind. She does not know how to properly explain everything in 
the order that would help Alice best comprehend everything, but Lain 
does not want this moment to go to waste. Deciding to blank out her mind 
and just wing it, she says, &quot;Actually, Alice, I...&quot;

      &quot;Hey, Lain, there you are! Yoo-hoo!&quot;

      Lain turns to find Lain of the Wired running up to her and hugging 
her tight from the side.

      &quot;Where have you been, honey?&quot; Lain of the Wired said, moving her 
arms down around Lain&#39;s body, pecking her cheek and nudging the tops of 
their heads together, &quot;You were gone for too long, you were making me 
worried.&quot;

      Alice gazes in astonishment at the sight of the two of them. &quot;Oh, 
hello there. Who might you be?&quot;

      &quot;Everyone calls me Wired,&quot; Lain of the Wired said.

      &quot;Oh,&quot; Alice said, obviously confused by the new girl&#39;s weird name, 
&quot;Are you twin sisters?&quot;

      &quot;You could say that,&quot; Lain of the Wired said.

      She places her one hand below Lain&#39;s top and then moves it up, 
revealing more of Lain&#39;s belly above her navel. Lain shivers a little at 
the physical contact. Although she had her mind set on what she wanted 
to do with Alice, she cannot stop herself from being overwhelmed by the 
senses Lain of the Wired is conveying to her again.

      &quot;But we&#39;re a whole lot more than that,&quot; Lain of the Wired 
continued.

      She reaches her other hand around Lain&#39;s head, pushes Lain&#39;s face 
in her direction, and locks lips with her. Regardless of the previous 
scene, Lain lets herself be overtaken by the physical pleasures. Lain of 
the Wired then cuddles with Lain, pushing her front body up against 
hers, their bare tummies flat smooth against each other. Lain of the 
Wired deepens their kiss with all her passion, and Lain obliges it on 
command. Their tongues enter and intertwine, emitting spittle from the 
sides of their mouths, in which the lovers bathe.

      They finally separate and space apart, enough that they still have 
their arms around each other and Lain&#39;s top slips back down. After a 
moment, Lain instantly remembers what had been going on beforehand. She 
looks to Alice, and is anxious by the expression on her face. Alice&#39;s 
face is beet red, and she stands frozen in place like a statue, staring 
at what appeared to be twin sisters being in a serious incestuous 
relationship.

      Eventually, Alice manages to say, &quot;Wow&quot; and nothing more.

      Lain now worries. &quot;Wait, Alice, it&#39;s not...I mean...&quot;

      Lain of the Wired quickly kisses Lain on the lips again for 
another moment, silencing her. As soon as they break apart, Lain of the 
Wired says, &quot;Now, honey, I think you should be coming back home with me, 
right now, this very minute.&quot;

      Lain looks into the eyes of Lain of the Wired, and, for the first 
time in a long while, detects a great sense of subtle vehemence in her 
other self.

      She looks to Alice. &quot;Sorry, Alice, I have to go. It was great 
talking with you. I can explain this to you later...&quot;

      &quot;That won&#39;t be necessary right now,&quot; Lain of the Wired said, &quot;You 
have a nice day, Ms. Alice.&quot; She then hooks her arm around that of Lain, 
and ushers her away from the playground.

      Alice just watches them leave until they vanish out of sight. She 
does not know how to contemplate what she had seen; it had all been very 
much like something out of a surrealistic dream. A couple questions nag 
in her mind; *She&#39;s called Lain?* and *How did that girl know my name?* 

      Lain and Lain of the Wired cut through the vacant cherry blossom 
park. Once Alice is no longer in sight, Lain of the Wired practically 
tugs at Lain&#39;s arm, forcing her to come at a brisk pace.

      &quot;It&#39;s not what it looked like,&quot; Lain said, &quot;I think what we did 
freaked her out a little...&quot;

      &quot;We&#39;ll talk when I&#39;m good and ready,&quot; Lain of the Wired curtly 
said.

      Her sharp tone silences Lain. Lain gets overcome by a sense of 
dread once again, and she is starting to fear their pending 
conversation. Lain of the Wired had completely misinterpreted her 
conversation with Alice, and she is angry without a doubt.  Lain thought 
that Lain of the Wired had changed since they hooked up, but now the old 
mannerisms of her other self seem to be resurfacing, and Lain does not 
know what to expect. Lain of the Wired saw what she saw and felt 
betrayed. But Lain was not there to betray her, so Lain has to explain 
everything to her other self as soon as she is willing to listen.

      Lain of the Wired comes to a stop at an especially remote spot in 
the park. She then faces Lain, with a most unnerving expression of 
abhorrence, and her hands balled into tight fists.

      After a moment of silence, Lain makes her second attempt to speak. 
&quot;I was just...&quot;

      SMACK! Lain finds her face cocked to one side, a bruise already 
clear on her cheek. Lain of the Wired stands with her extended arm to 
the side, her expression the same.

      She then says, &quot;Why were you talking to her?&quot;

      Lain feels the impact on her cheek with her hand. She had no idea 
that her other self&#39;s fury would go this far, and it stings on a deeper 
level. She begins to tear up.

      &quot;I asked you, why were you talking to her?&quot;

      &quot;I...was trying to tell you,&quot; Lain said, somewhat hesitating, her 
voice quivering a little, &quot;I was going for a walk, and I just saw her in 
my path. I felt that I had a chance to talk to her again after not 
seeing her for so long...&quot;

      &quot;*Why*?&quot;

      Lain pauses at the blunt question, taking a couple of deep breaths 
so that she can manage more than one sentence. &quot;Because Alice, was 
someone dear, the last time I was human. She looked unhappy, and...I 
swear to you it&#39;s not what it looked like. I wasn&#39;t trying to make her 
fall in love with me again, I really wasn&#39;t.&quot;

      &quot;And yet you were jumping on the opportunity to help her remember 
her past, and therefore remember you,&quot; Lain of the Wired stated 
rhythmically, &quot;You were hoping to make things like the old days again so 
that you could feel closer to her. And what would come after that? You 
would try to get intimate with her, convince her to leave her husband 
and be happy with you, and you could forget all about me.&quot;

      &quot;No! That&#39;s not true!&quot;

      &quot;Isn&#39;t it? You looked pretty serious back there, the way you were 
fumbling to find the right words and all.&quot;

      Lain is struck speechless. She feels she is truly getting stabbed 
by her lover&#39;s words, who seems to be taking sadistic pleasure from it. 
She cannot take much more of this.

      &quot;Face it, Lain. Alice doesn&#39;t love you. She didn&#39;t return your 
feelings back then, and what makes you think she will now, if she 
learned everything that had happened before? Only I can love you, Lain. 
There is no other person you should look at other than me. I throw 
myself at you, give you the time of your life both during the day and 
night, and yet you still never fully let me in.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s not true! We danced together and shared love! They were 
always precious to me!&quot;

      &quot;Now how is *that* true? Yes, we made love, Lain, but I could feel 
your subtle repression. You accepted me because you thought there would 
be nothing or nobody else. Even as we fucked, your mind on the most 
deepest of levels was elsewhere. I could sense it, because you had never 
fully spiritually connected with me on those nights. I never mentioned 
it because I thought you needed time, and soon enough you would come to 
terms with yourself and accept me, but I was wrong. Don&#39;t ever see Alice 
again, Lain.&quot;

      Much to Lain&#39;s own surprise, anger begins to build up, leveling up 
against the dreaded shame that has been there. She no longer feels that 
Lain of the Wired had been doing her a favor all this time, and instead 
feels that she is deliberately attempting control over her life. Lain 
will not have that. &quot;Who do you think you are? You are not in charge of 
me! I am my own person! I accepted you because that was what I wanted! 
Alice was my friend, and I have every right to see her!&quot;

      &quot;If you continue doing so, then I&#39;ll hurt her.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;ll hurt her?! You wouldn&#39;t!&quot;

      &quot;Oh yes I would,&quot; Lain of the Wired said, smiling, &quot;I could pose 
as you and introduce myself to her. Then I could beat her up and make 
her fear you. Or maybe I could make her remember everything by myself, 
which would not only make Alice fear you again but also hate you again. 
Or maybe, just maybe, to ensure her disgust in loving another woman, I 
could rape her!&quot;

      Without a word, Lain runs at Lain of the Wired and socks her 
straight in the face, who spins about and falls front first onto the 
ground. She stays there for the moment as if knocked unconscious, but 
Lain can still see her breathing, and her arms moving wearily.

      &quot;Now you listen to me!&quot; Lain said, &quot;Hurting me was one thing! But 
what you said was pure evil, and now I hate you! If you ever go near 
Alice, I will loathe you on the deepest level beyond redemption! I may 
not have the power to cancel you out anymore, but that won&#39;t stop me 
from making your life a living hell!&quot;

      Lain of the Wired forces herself up off the ground on her arms and 
legs. Apparent sounds of laughter emit from her underside face as her 
shoulders and torso shiver along with it.

      Her rage coming back to her, Lain kicks her other self hard in her 
bare tummy from underneath, sending her rolling onto her back. Then Lain 
stops, witnessing the most terrifying image she never expected.

      The eyes of Lain of the Wired are already beet red and moist from 
the tears welling down the sides of her face. She covers over her hit 
belly with her arms, her body arching over it in a fetal position. She 
is not laughing; she is crying like a helpless soul. Lain looks closer 
to make sure she is not acting it. Upon confirming that she is crying 
for real, it scares Lain even more. She has never known Lain of the 
Wired to be like this. Her other self has always been tough and have 
given everyone a hard time for her own pleasure. And yet here she is, as 
if another Lain personality has taken a hold of her.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lain of the Wired choked out, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry, 
I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

      Regardless of what had taken place, what Lain sees now is a 
vulnerable girl crying for help, and her fury, if not her own pain, 
dissipates away. Lain kneels down, pulls Lain of the Wired up off the 
ground and holds her close, her soft-haired head underneath that of 
Lain&#39;s.

      After a long moment, still sobbing, with her one hand on Lain&#39;s 
shoulder, Lain of the Wired manages to say, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it, Lain. I 
would never hurt Alice. But *you* hurt *me*! When you canceled me out, I 
never felt so lonely in all my existence. When I came back to reality, 
you were all I had left, and I wanted to be by your side! We both made 
mistakes in our lives, but I was hoping that we could change each other. 
I hoped I could bring out a side of you that you never knew you had. You 
brought out a new side of me too, and all our moments were precious to 
me. When I told you that only I could love you, I meant it.  I wanted 
you to want me and nothing else. I thought all we could have was each 
other. But then I found out there was still a part of you with Alice, 
and she was the one holding you back the whole time, and it was just 
killing me!&quot;

      Lain of the Wired then opens her eyes, and looks directly at 
Lain&#39;s. Her genuine vulnerability is working on Lain&#39;s last nerve, 
making Lain feel like coming to the point of breaking down herself.

      &quot;You can&#39;t go back to Alice, Lain, not the way you are now. You 
don&#39;t know how to reconnect with her. You&#39;re afraid that you&#39;ll scare 
her and make her hate you again, and you&#39;re always thinking this. It&#39;s 
because you&#39;re not confident about yourself, you haven&#39;t fully loved 
yourself all this time. How can you properly love somebody else when you 
haven&#39;t even fully accepted yourself? I am your other self, Lain. For a 
time, you have to make me your whole world. I&#39;ve been making you mine, 
and I never felt so alive. I love you, Lain. I love you!&quot;

      Lain of the Wired cups Lain&#39;s cheek, the one she had hit. The burn 
that had once been there dissipates. Lain is just overwhelmed by this 
turnaround of everything. The words of Lain of the Wired echo through 
Lain&#39;s mind. *You can&#39;t go back to Alice, Lain, not now...you haven&#39;t 
fully loved yourself all this time...how can you properly love somebody 
else...For the time being, you have to make me your whole world*. She 
cannot fully comprehend what it all means, but she realizes one thing; 
she cannot dwell on it. Although she does not totally understand, she 
must devote her whole mind and heart to one person; Lain of the Wired. 
She cannot think about Alice when she has someone most dear to her right 
here and now that needs her the most.

      She embraces her other self hard and says, &quot;Forgive me.&quot;

      &quot;Forgive you? Why? I should be saying that, but you shouldn&#39;t 
forgive me.&quot;

      &quot;No, I forgive you. You said terrible things, and they left a 
scar, but I forgive you. I have hurt you too. We both left a scar, but 
no matter the injuries, we are still alive so we must live and deal with 
it. You are the one who returned to me, brought me back to the real 
world, saved me from nothingness, returned my humanity, danced with me, 
and helped me experience the sensual pleasures of love. For that you 
will always be important to me. I will always love you, my other self.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired leans back to look at Lain&#39;s face to 
double-check her sincerity. Gratified with what she sees, she kisses 
Lain more deeply than ever before, with Lain returning the favor.

      After a moment, regardless of how long it was, Lain of the Wired 
breaks away. &quot;Shall we go back to your room?&quot;

      &quot;No, let&#39;s stay here, in this cherry blossom forest,&quot; Lain said, 
&quot;The leaves are starting to fall, and it&#39;s beautiful here. There is no 
other perfect atmosphere.&quot;

      &quot;But other people walk through here.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s alright. We&#39;re in this park, but I already made sure we&#39;re 
in a different plane. Nobody will see or hear us from where they&#39;re at. 
Let&#39;s stay here and go nowhere else. Let&#39;s stay here for as long as 
we&#39;re satisfied. I am going to make up to you for all our previous 
nights.&quot;

      Lain of the Wired continues tearing as she begins to manually 
remove her clothes. &quot;Thank you, Lain.&quot;

      Lain nods, removing her own clothing. &quot;I love you, my other self, 
and I am going to prove it.&quot;

      Time passes without relevance to the domain of love Lain occupies. 
Nothing else in known existence even matters amongst the atmosphere of 
falling cherry blossom petals. All during this moment, she experiences 
inheriting the universe, as if taking everything bit by bit to fill in 
all the essentials of her being that were initially suffering a void. It 
all passes like a dream; hazy, always moving and yet comfortable. Lain 
feels no further security than to just go with the flow. 

      Just like a dream, Lain eventually wakes. She finds herself lying 
down on her back on the cherry blossom-covered ground of the park. She 
looks to her left, then to her right, and does not see Lain of the Wired 
anywhere next to her. She then forces herself to sit up, and notices she 
is wearing whole new attire. Her pants are mottled navy and olive, and 
she is wearing a grey-colored tank top, half in length that displays her 
belly. She is still donned with band accessories, including a choker 
around her neck which only Lain of the Wired used to wear. Next to her 
on the ground is a short black leather jacket, in which its origins will 
never be determined.

      Lain does not ponder over what happened, because she already knows 
on the unconscious level. She will never see Lain of the Wired again, at 
least not as a subjective form in existence. Lain had made love to her 
with all her passion, voluntarily giving up her soul in exchange for 
that of her other self. They have always been two different beings that 
shared the same shell vessel known to people as a body. As they 
gradually melded together they literally became one. Lain is still Lain, 
but she is also Lain of the Wired. She now realizes what her other self 
meant by asking how you could possibly love other people when you don&#39;t 
love yourself. Lain had always feared and hated herself, let alone her 
other self, and had done so for a period of time that she had isolated 
herself from the world for so long. Not anymore. She has come around to 
loving and accepting her other half, and now she is a complete human 
being. She can move on with life, and take in all the other things that 
would make her interrelation with the world itself more complete.

      She puts on her newfound jacket and walks out of the park. On the 
street, she eventually sees GA, and comes up to meet him.

      &quot;Oh hey, Lain,&quot; GA said, &quot;Or, wait, are you...?&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m Lain,&quot; she said, laughing.

      &quot;You&#39;re wearing different gear, so I couldn&#39;t tell. You haven&#39;t 
been back to Cyberia for a while, I was starting to worry whether or not 
you and your girlfriend would come back.&quot;

      &quot;How long has it been?&quot; Lain casually asked.

      &quot;A week.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s all?&quot; Lain asked, who felt her time with Lain of the Wired 
was a blissful eternity.

      &quot;What&#39;s been going on, and where&#39;s your sweetheart?&quot;

      Lain smiles. &quot;You won&#39;t be seeing her anymore.&quot;

      &quot;She left you?&quot;

      &quot;No, not really. It&#39;s too complicated to explain, but I&#39;ll just 
say she&#39;s still a part of me.&quot;

      &quot;Okay,&quot; GA said, clearly not getting it, &quot;Are you still going to 
come to work at Cyberia?&quot;

      &quot;I will. I enjoy working there, and I have a lot of fun, so yes. I 
can only hope that the clubbers there will accept me being alone there.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m sure if you mean business, they&#39;ll get used to it. You say 
you&#39;re coming back, so that&#39;s great news. Anyway, there have been more 
open lesbians that have been visiting Cyberia lately because of you. 
Once they hear you&#39;re not spoken for anymore, they might like to meet 
you...&quot;

      &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll see them,&quot; Lain said, &quot;But until I have the chance to 
go and clarify something, there will be only one woman who will claim me 
and my heart. I&#39;m on my way to meet her now.&quot;

      &quot;Really? Wow, there&#39;s apparently a lot about you I don&#39;t know. 
Well, you do what you have to. See you later.&quot;

      &quot;See you later, and thank you,&quot; Lain said.

      As GA walks away, Lain breaks into a run. She now knows how to 
properly approach her, and possibly reveal all her secrets to her. She 
may still be freaked out a little after seeing Lain French-kiss who she 
assumed to be Lain&#39;s twin sister, but Lain knows how she will explain it 
to her if she is willing to listen. There is the possibility Lain will 
get around to making her remember everything. There is also the 
possibility that she will once again be afraid of Lain, but Lain is 
prepared to face and deal with that, and to help her cope with her 
story, in a way where she might gradually become unafraid of Lain. She 
is a full-grown adult now, so she would not so much share the same 
trauma she did as a teenager. There is the chance that deep down, she 
still loves the husband that she is married to, and that she would be 
willing to socialize with Lain for the purposes of regaining her 
memories and a lost friendship but nothing else. Whatever the outcome of 
the case may be, Lain will be prepared for it. She must see her, talk to 
her, at least one more time.

      Lain continues running until she arrives at the playground again, 
and finds none other than Alice sitting on the swing like before. Lain 
slows down to her walking gait, and makes her casual approach toward 
Alice. As Lain does so, she sings;

      And you don&#39;t seem to understand 
      A shame you seemed an honest man 
      And all the fears you hold so dear 
      Will turn to whisper in your ear

      And you know what they say might hurt you 
      And you know that it means so much 
      And you don&#39;t even feel a thing

      I am falling, I am fading, 
      I have lost it all

      And you don&#39;t seem the lying kind 
      A shame that I can read your mind 
      And all the things that I read there 
      Candle-lit smile that we both share

      And you know I don&#39;t mean to hurt you 
      But you know that it means so much 
      And you don&#39;t even feel a thing

      I am falling, I am fading, I am drowning, 
      Help me to breathe 
      I am hurting, I have lost it all 
      I am losing 
      Help me to breathe

      Alice takes notice of Lain&#39;s presence and looks up at her a lot 
sooner than Lain had with Lain of the Wired when she had singed that 
song. Alice seems entranced by the melody of Lain&#39;s voice, the same way 
that Lain was first entranced by it with Lain of the Wired. There is no 
expression of glee or anger from Alice, but there is kindness 
nonetheless.

      When Lain finishes, she says, &quot;That was &#39;Duvet&#39; by Boa. I always 
loved that song. It reminds me of you, therefore I dedicate my 
performance of it to you.&quot;

      Alice smiles. &quot;You did sing it rather beautifully.&quot; She takes a 
breath, then says, &quot;I was hoping to see you again, Lain.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ve returned,&quot; Lain said, with confidence and a tender smile, 
&quot;Hello, Alice.&quot; 

THE END 

      [The clothing of Lain and Lain of the Wired was inspired by one of 
the Lain posters, where she is leaning against a road guardrail and 
looking into the distance with a subtle smile, and also from the Cyberia 
Remix soundtrack. The clothing store they visit is the same last name of 
Yoshitabe Abe, the character designer of &#39;Serial Experiments Lain&#39; and 
creator of &#39;Haibane Renmei,&#39; my all-time favorite Anime series (Abe 
Clothing Home is a play on Old Home). The DJ&#39;s name, GA, are initials 
for Greg Ayres, an English dub actor who also specializes as a DJ in 
real life. Although unrelated to &#39;Serial Experiments Lain,&#39; I felt like 
writing him into this fanfic.

      If you were expecting a more conclusive ending instead of the 
ambiguous one I wrote, sorry, but I think the ending I wrote is 
appropriate enough. For Anime stories of any kind, it would be weirder 
to have more conclusive endings, don&#39;t you think? If you&#39;re wondering 
where the black leather jacket came from, I can&#39;t say myself. Perhaps it 
is a new mystery that means whatever you want it to mean?

      I hope you enjoyed it. If you have any comments, please send them 
on my e-mail address and I will surely still be around even by 2008 if 
you read this by then.]</pre>
