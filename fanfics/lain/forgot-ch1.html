<h1>Forgotten</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lain/index.html">Serial Experiments Lain</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/althea.html">Althea K.</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It had been nearly a year since meeting the girl on the bridge, but her
name (Lain) was still lodged in Arisu&#39;s brain like a bullet. The girl
had assured her that they had never met before, but Arisu still couldn&#39;t
shake the feeling that they had. She went on with her life just as if she
had never seen the girl that day, only mildly distracted by her presence
in her mind (Lain); life with her husband was pleasant and comfortable
and she wasn&#39;t quite bothered enough by the peculiar incident (Lain)
to dwell on it too much. It was often only when she was alone (Lain)
that she found herself thinking on it.

The kitchen took on a bleak blue cast on rainy days, and the rain
trickling down the window panes always reminded Arisu of tears.

&quot;Who are you crying for today, Kami-sama?&quot; (Lain) she mumbled absently as
she washed dishes still decorated with remnants of breakfast. A shiver
(Lain) suddenly raced up her spine and she paused in her task. Soap
suds ran down her hands in time with the rain. (Lain) &quot;So cold... And
dark.&quot; She glanced across the room at the light switch. It hadn&#39;t been so
dark when she had first set out to clean the dishes, but the food had been
congealing all day and was stuck fiercely to the surfaces, which made the
task even more trying to Arisu, who had never especially liked cleaning
in the first place. The room had grown dark as she worked, and now,
still not done, Arisu regretted not turning on the light while her hands
were still dry. &quot;Damn,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I never should&#39;ve promised that I&#39;d
clean up...&quot; She stood for a moment, trying to decide whether to dry her
hands and turn on the light or just to stay in the dark, and she suddenly
found her mind had wandered back to that day (Lain). &quot;Hmmm...&quot; She shook
her head. &quot;So strange.&quot; She sighed again and turned her head to grant
her a view of the windows. &quot;And sad. It was...  sad.&quot; The girl (Lain)
smiled at her from her memory, that smile which confused her as much as
the strange sense of deja vu (Lain) the girl had stirred within her. That
smile had shown a pain and knowledge that the girl had not spoken of,
and her eyes seemed just as knowing and hurt when they had locked into
Arisu&#39;s. A warmth was buried deep within them, underneath the sadness that
gave such age to eyes that should have been so young, a curious glow that
had left Arisu breathless for a moment before she had remembered herself.

A soft knock at the door snapped Arisu back into the present day. She
stared in a daze for a moment before realizing what had happened,
then reached for a cloth to wipe her hands on. &quot;Just a moment!&quot; she
called, absentmindedly tucking a stray whisp of dark brown hair behind
her ear. (Lain Lain Lain Lain Lain Lain Lain Lain Lain Lain Lain) The
instant her hand wrapped around the doorknob she was struck with the
overwhelming and illogical feeling that it would be the girl standing
at the other side of the door.

(LainLainLainLainLainLainLainLainLainLainLainLainLain) She twisted the
knob and opened the door to the length of the chain locking it, then
put her eye to the crack. &quot;He-- -&quot; Her voice died in her throat.

&quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;L-Lain...&quot;

The short, soft-faced girl smiled brightly. &quot;You remember me.&quot;

&quot;Iwakura Lain... isn&#39;t it?&quot; Arisu unlocked the door and opened it the
rest of the way.

&quot;You said we might meet again, didn&#39;t you?&quot; It was hard to tell whether
she was teasing.

Arisu stood in the doorway staring for a long moment. &quot;H-how..&quot; Her
voice cracked and she paused to clear her throat nervously.

&quot;How did you find where I live?&quot;

Lain smiled, tilted her head to one side, and lied: &quot;I looked it up.&quot;

&quot;D-did I give you my full name?&quot;

&quot;I suppose you must have.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t remember telling you my family name...&quot;

Lain&#39;s eyes dulled suddenly. Arisu was unnerved by her strange stare. Then
her eyes began to shine again. &quot;I think I do. Do you think it happened,
then?&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t get you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s alright. It doesn&#39;t matter. May I come in?&quot;

&quot;I guess...&quot; Arisu glanced around. &quot;Did you come with your parents?&quot;

Lain frowned. &quot;I have no parents.&quot;

&quot;Oh. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Arisu&#39;s eyes softened.

&quot;It&#39;s alright. I&#39;ve gotten used to it.&quot; Arisu turned aside to let her in,
shutting and locking the door behind her. &quot;Hmm... Dark in here, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Arisu flicked on the light. &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;Say...&quot; Lain turned to look up at her hostess. &quot;Aren&#39;t you concerned
about what your husband would think if he found out you let a stranger
into the house when you&#39;re all alone?&quot;

(Lain) Arisu&#39;s heart stopped. &quot;W-what?&quot; She steadied herself against a
wall. &quot;How did you know I&#39;m alone?&quot;

Lain hesitated, hovering for a moment between complete honesty and
a half-truth.  &quot;There&#39;s only one car in your driveway.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; She giggled nervously. &quot;I&#39;m sorry; I&#39;m just a little freaked out.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;d&#39;ve been suspicious too.&quot;

&quot;Uhm, won&#39;t you sit down? I&#39;ll make us some tea, if you like.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Lain sat down at the kitchen table, her feet not quite
reaching the floor from the height of the chair. She slowly ran her eyes
around the room as Arisu prepared the tea. &quot;You have a nice place.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; They chatted pleasantly over the tea, despite Arisu&#39;s poorly
concealed wonderment at the ability of one clearly so young to speak to
her as if an adult (Lain).

Glancing at the clock as she set down her emptied cup, Lain announced:
&quot;I should probably leave soon. Your husband&#39;ll be home in a few hours and
you should really finish cleaning up. A promise is a promise, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;W-what??&quot; Arisu&#39;s hand tightened around her teacup. (Lain)

&quot;Careful. You&#39;ll break it.&quot;

&quot;H-how did you know all that? How... I-I...&quot;

Lain smiled sadly as she rose from her chair. &quot;I know everything.&quot; She
gently pried Arisu&#39;s fingers from around the cup.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t need to.&quot; She held Arisu&#39;s hand for a long moment, then turned
to move for the door. She paused not far from the door, lingering there
for a long moment.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Arisu finally asked.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you want me to leave?&quot;

Arisu gave a start (Lain). Lain peeked over her shoulder and smiled. &quot;I
know everything... that doesn&#39;t mean I understand everything.&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Arisu...&quot; Lain turned to face her. Arisu stared at her, completely
unable to read her (Lain). &quot;May I tell you a story?&quot;

She blinked. &quot;A story?&quot;

&quot;Yes. It&#39;s something that you don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I thought you were about to leave.&quot; Lain gave her an awkward look,
then angled her face downward slightly. Arisu laughed, relieved
by the childishness of the action. Lain peered up at her in mild
confusion. &quot;Alright, Lain-chan. Tell me a story if you really want to.&quot;

Lain half-smiled at her, eyes filled with a sudden and deep sorrow
that disturbed her. &quot;It happened not so many years ago, but it seems a
much longer time ago than it really was.  You were still just a girl,
no older than I...&quot; (Lain)

Arisu worried her brow. &quot;The story&#39;s about me?&quot;

Lain continued, apparently ignoring Arisu&#39;s surprise. &quot;There was a girl in
your grade who was shy and withdrawn, and you were the nicest person she
ever met. Even when she lost herself in a world that you didn&#39;t understand
and everything about her was changing,&quot; (Lain) &quot;you stayed her friend. All
of her friends were people she connected with in the Wired.. except for
you. You were her friend without needing to connect to her through those
means. You were her only real friend.&quot; Her eyes shone wet with unshed
tears. &quot;You were the only thing that was real in her life. You were all
that she had outside of the Wired.&quot; There was a sudden pause. Arisu sat
in silence, paralyzed, as she watched Lain&#39;s childish face contort with
pain (Lain). When she resumed, her voice was unsteady.

&quot;Even when bad things happened, you were still her friend. And so when she
changed everyone else&#39;s memories so that the bad things never happened,
she left your memory untouched.

&quot;But you... You couldn&#39;t understand why. You didn&#39;t want to live with
those memories.  She didn&#39;t mean to hurt you, but...&quot; She shook her
head. &quot;One day, you finally couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and you went to see
her and to demand to know why it was you alone that had to remember. Her
house was completely wrecked... By the time you reached her room, you
were terrified. And if you hadn&#39;t been by then, one look at her room
would&#39;ve been enough to do it. She was practically buried in wires,
surrounded by computers...  The conditions were inhuman, and you wondered
then if maybe your friend had somehow become inhuman herself.&quot; (Lain)

&quot;She certainly didn&#39;t look human... When she approached you, still
draped in wires, she looked almost like an apparition; her skin was so
pale..&quot; Lain sniffled quietly. &quot;You started to cry. You begged her to
tell you why you had to remember everything. She...&quot;

She sniffled again.

&quot;She hadn&#39;t realized until then that it would hurt you. She never wanted
to hurt you. But you didn&#39;t understand her motivations... You thought
she did it because she hated you.  &quot;But you were wrong. She could never
hate you for anything.&quot; A tear ran down her cheek, and was quickly wiped
away. It wasn&#39;t until that moment that Arisu realized that she had at
some point begun to cry as well. &quot;She had never considered that it might
hurt you to remember, and the sight of your tears was such a sad beauty
that she almost couldn&#39;t bear it.&quot; (Lain)

&quot;Knowing that you thought she hated you was a deeper hurt than anything
she had ever felt. She crawled as close to you as she could, trying to
explain herself to you, mesmerized by your tears.. She never hated you
at all. But you didn&#39;t seem to understand.. She tried to explain to
you, but...&quot;

Lain shook her head again. &quot;She tried to kiss you, and you backed
away. And when she tried to kiss you again...&quot; Her voice choked off. For
several minutes, the only sound was of the rain.

&quot;And later...&quot; Lain began again. &quot;Later... You held her hand against
your heart. You wanted her to understand that she was human, that she
was wrong about it all.. She asked you why your heart was pounding,
but... But she never told you...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Arisu whispered through her tears. &quot;What didn&#39;t she tell me?&quot;

&quot;Her heart was pounding, too.&quot; Lain brought one hand to hover over her
heart. &quot;It was pounding so hard.. But you couldn&#39;t hear it. You never
felt it, that maddening heartbeat..  You said your heart was pounding
because you were scared. Was that really why?&quot; She locked Arisu in her
desperate gaze.

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know.. I d-don&#39;t...&quot; She closed her eyes and clasped her
hands together firmly in her lap to stop their shaking (Lain).

&quot;Please... I c-can&#39;t... I don-n&#39;t..&quot; Tears dropped down onto her
hands, turning cold as they made their passage from her face. &quot;I don&#39;t
unders-stand.. why... y-you&#39;re..&quot; Her breath came in short, burdened
gasps. She began to slump forward slowly, retreating to a fetal position.

&quot;The girl was me.&quot; (Lain)

The world held still for a full three seconds.

Arisu&#39;s head jerked up to let her stare with her blurred and reddened
eyes at the girl before her, breaking her out of the temporary state
of paralysis. &quot;W-what??&quot; There was no trace of humor or deception on
the girl&#39;s face. &quot;B-but... That... That&#39;s not *possible*!!  T-the age
d-difference...&quot; (Lain)

&quot;It... it can&#39;t..&quot; Arisu closed her eyes again and began to shake
her head.

&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not POSSIBLE!!!&quot; Arisu clamped her fingers onto her skull as if
she could crush the thought out of her mind. Her chair clattered to the
ground as she shot to her feet and staggered backward blindly to lean
against the wall once again.

&quot;It&#39;s true.&quot;

&quot;No... No...&quot; she whimpered.

&quot;I love you.&quot;

Her fingers loosened. &quot;What?&quot; As she opened her eyes again, more tears
spilled down her face. Lain stood just a short distance away from her,
the glow in her eyes stronger in that moment than it had been on the
bridge, as strong as it had been that day so many years ago, the last
day of Iwakura Lain&#39;s known existence.

&quot;I was afraid to come find you again. I hesitated for so long... I didn&#39;t
trust myself. But I just couldn&#39;t stay away... I missed you too much... I
love you too much... I had to see you again. It was a mistake. I shouldn&#39;t
have given in.. I didn&#39;t want to interfere with your happy life. I wanted
so much to make you happy, and now I&#39;ve stupidly let myself meddle in
it all...&quot; She offered Arisu a small, pained smile. &quot;I guess I messed
up everything again, hunh?&quot;

Arisu blinked slowly, feeling lost in a sudden haze (Lain). &quot;Did the
lights just dim?&quot; she murmured sleepily.

Lain smiled softly, sorrow and pain still hovering like a mist about
her. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that.&quot; Lain reached out and gently took Arisu&#39;s
hand again. &quot;It won&#39;t matter.&quot;

&quot;What.. do you...&quot; Arisu felt her muscles relaxing against her will,
her body sliding down the wall. Lain moved to gather her into her
arms. (Lain) She fought against her drooping eyelids to look into the
girl&#39;s eyes once more. She let out a small whimper as she struggled to
bring her into focus. &quot;Everything... is... f-fading...&quot; (Lain)

&quot;It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s alright.&quot; Arisu dimly felt fingers whispering through
her hair.

&quot;P-please... help...&quot; (l-Lain) &quot;Please...&quot; She could barely see at all
anymore. (lai-)

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Her voice sounded as if it had traveled the distance
of the universe (la--) before it could reach Arisu&#39;s ears. The warmth
of being held eased the terror of the slow fading of all her senses,
and Arisu allowed herself a shaky smile. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Arisu.&quot;

The voice sounded so muted and distant that Arisu couldn&#39;t tell whether
she was imagining it or if she really heard it. (l-la--)

&quot;For what?&quot; Arisu managed to whisper. She could barely make out the
slight curve of Lain&#39;s lonesome smile. As everything finally faded
to utter darkness, Arisu thought she felt the slight pressure of lips
against her forehead.

And when she awoke, the girl (----) had never been.

(Harumph. I probably should&#39;ve just stuck with the utenaanthy fic
I&#39;d originally planned on submitting... Darn that stupid telephone
company. *shrug* Well, whatever. Oh, yes...  I should probably have
a disclaimer here, right? Ok then. Serial experiments Lain and its
characters do not belong to me, but to... someone... talented... and
cool. But I&#39;m too lazy to go see who it is. Heh. And they will
continue to not belong to me, no matter how much I giggle over Lain&#39;s
adorable pajamas, no matter how much I want to play with Arisu&#39;s hair,
no matter how much I drool over Mika, and no matter how much I want one
of those pocket communicators. Alright, I think that pretty much covers
it... *walks off humming Duvet, as she&#39;s been listening to the BOA cd
that came with the lunch box set over and over throughout writing all
this... pathetically enough*)
