<h1>Water Shadows (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../lain/index.html">Serial Experiments Lain</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/twig.html">Twig</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../lain/watshad-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>It got worse. Or better. More likely, she was just going crazy and these 
were the varying, preliminary steps - it wasn&#39;t as if crazy people ever 
mentioned how their madness started, or what it was that finally sent 
them over the edge. Maybe she wouldn&#39;t even realize she&#39;d lost her mind, 
Arisu thought, it would just come slowly, like the passing of one season 
to the next.

The feeling of being watched intensified, and at times she found herself 
tense, as if waiting, catching a flicker of movement from the corner of 
her eye and spinning suddenly - in the park, in the office - only to see 
nothing but an empty hallway behind her, or a leaf slowly fluttering to 
the ground. If it were insanity, though, Arisu thought for sure it would 
have truly frightened her more, or that it would have seemed to have 
some effect on the world around her. Maybe one or two people commented 
on some greater distraction, frowning a bit as she asked them to repeat 
themselves, but other than that, on the outside everything stayed the 
same.

It wasn&#39;t only that her perceptions changed, Arisu thought, but the way 
it happened. Not so much that she was learning anything new but that she 
no longer panicked so much, didn&#39;t reject the small interjections by 
whatever new reality had touched her so briefly that night - a hand, a 
human hand... Lain? - and the world was actually changing. Life had been 
one long string of numbing, marching binary code, ones and zeroes never 
changing, black and white and endless - until now. She couldn&#39;t see it, 
could only feel it - like everything else, it seemed impossible - but 
she knew the whole world had changed, would change, just for her. All 
she had to do was accept it, it seemed, and an entire universe would 
open itself up at her feet.

It wasn&#39;t enough. Or more accurately, these new moments just weren&#39;t 
happening the right way. Maybe Lain, or whatever it was that was 
haunting her, was trying to be gentle, being as careful as possible not 
to frighten her, but this was just silly. At this rate, it would take 
her forever to learn what was going on - and after countless days of 
this almost-contact, standing in the shower and waiting while nothing 
happened, waiting for any sign, any chance to reach back if anyone 
reached out again... waiting...

//Why not ask? If you&#39;re so ready, tell her so.//

It took a few more days for Arisu to pull together the strength to 
really go through with it - it would change everything, she knew that 
without knowing how or why, that to reach out like this would alter her 
entire life, to just stop, brace herself-

//Why not now?//

Quickly, she crossed the street, walking into a small city park, and 
moving onto the most secluded path she could find, her hands clenched 
and a strange tightness in her limbs. Arisu listened to the click of her 
shoes against the pavement for a few moments, and then stopped, forcing 
herself to speak before she could convince herself not to.

&quot;I know you&#39;re there. I know you can hear me.&quot; Arisu glanced around, 
making sure she was alone, though she doubted anyone would find it that 
strange to see a woman talking to herself in this city. Maybe she could 
grab her cell phone and make it look as if she were -

Arisu felt a rustle of wind behind her, a few leaves skittering across 
the surface of the pavement, saw the outline of a vague shadow, melting 
in with her own. She turned, unsure what to expect, the fear evaporating 
as her eyes met a familiar face.

&quot;Hello, Arisu.&quot; The girl&#39;s voice was strangely toneless, and soft, and 
even though her smile seemed a little strange, Arisu felt her heart 
twinge anyway - it was a gentle, careful smile, as if she might run 
screaming at any moment.

&quot;Lain. You&#39;re... Lain, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

She took a careful step forward, as if the girl was a wild animal who 
might spook or - it seemed more possible, somehow - that she might just 
disappear, blur and fade and shatter like the leaves still scratching 
here and there along the pavement. The girl didn&#39;t speak, one strand of 
hair falling in front of her face, waving a little in the breeze, the 
edge of her skirt - a school uniform, /her/ school&#39;s uniform - 
fluttering slightly.

&quot;Please... can you tell me who you are? Or... what... what you are? 
What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Will you walk with me, Arisu?&quot;

The abrupt, careful question - Lain did not want to answer her, and she 
wondered if the tremor she swore she heard was really one of fear? What 
would the girl have to fear, she was obviously the one in control.

//... but she can&#39;t control my reactions, and that&#39;s why she&#39;s so 
frightened.//

Arisu blinked at the sudden rightness of the thought, found herself 
nodding gently. &quot;All right, we can walk if you&#39;d like to.&quot;

It was strange, the way the rest of the world disappeared into light and 
shadow and background noise, and all she was aware of was Lain - the 
sound of her breathing, the way the light turned her hair into so many 
colors, brown and soft gold - it would feel smooth, if she dared to 
reach out and touch, to make sure the girl was real. Arisu tried not to 
look every few moments, as they walked down the path in silence, finally 
re-emerging onto a somewhat crowded street, but her eyes were drawn to 
Lain, and more than once she found herself faltering, as the girl stared 
back at her.

&quot;The uniform, I thought I remembered... you were in my school, weren&#39;t 
you.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;We were friends, weren&#39;t we.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;How did I hurt you?&quot;

Lain stopped walking, Arisu knew she had struck with those words, swore 
she could read the girl&#39;s mind as she looked into her eyes - it seemed 
that she might bolt, that whomever she was and whatever power she had to 
make the world change and stand still, whether phantom or illusion or 
maybe just some strange hallucination, she was also a frightened girl. 
The two of them had walked this path before, this maze of questions and 
answers and more questions - and at the end of it Arisu knew she had 
left Lain alone.

Gently, she lifted her hands, putting them on the girl&#39;s shoulders, 
forcing her to look up - the end of that tied-up strand of hair brushed 
against her hand, yes it was as soft as she had thought it would be - 
and Arisu smiled her best steady smile, wanting to feel strong even if 
she did not, wanting Lain to feel secure.

&quot;I won&#39;t leave you, all right? I promise, whatever...&quot; she paused, knew 
it was quite a promise to make, when she still had so many more 
questions than answers. &quot;Whatever you show me, whatever happens after 
this... I&#39;ve grown up, Lain. I&#39;m not afraid anymore. I...&quot;

... and then she looked, really /looked/ at her hand, at the cuff of her 
sleeve that was no longer the color it should be, and Arisu whirled away 
from Lain to stare at her reflection in the side of a building -

//I&#39;ve grown up. I&#39;ve...//

The Arisu that stared back at her was straight from a photograph, the 
girl she had been back then, high-school uniform and all. Slowly, she 
lifted a hand, turning it this way and that, no longer caring if anyone 
saw or what they thought. Behind her, she saw the reflection Lain bow 
her head.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. It was easier for me, I... like you like this, I...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot;

The tiny part of her brain that still wasn&#39;t stunned was actually 
screeching in joy, something about crow&#39;s feet and laugh lines and other 
inane chatter. Arisu numbly slid her hand into a pocket, found the 
wallet she had carried - no doubt there was money inside. Finally, her 
mind was able to latch on to something to say.

&quot;Would you like to go get something to eat?&quot;

Lain nodded, and there was joy in her eyes - Arisu knew what it was in 
the air now, that the world held its breath for fear of rejection, and 
though she knew the girl was happy, Lain was still hiding her smile.

----------------------

Choosing to eat at the top of the tower, the expensive, touristy spot, 
didn&#39;t strike her as extremely stupid until they had arrived and been 
seated. Only then, staring out over the city, did Arisu realize that it 
was probably no big deal for Lain to be here. Maybe she didn&#39;t even need 
a building, to see the city from this height. Maybe she didn&#39;t even need 
to see the city, to see the city.

//Now what&#39;s that supposed to mean?//

&quot;Are you happy, Arisu?&quot; The question was measured, and gentle. Lain 
would not look at her. &quot;You&#39;re alone. Are you happy being alone?&quot;

&quot;No, not really.&quot; Arisu made sure her reply was just as gentle, though 
it wasn&#39;t hard to keep it light. The emptiness she&#39;d felt, the 
connection, she couldn&#39;t even explain it enough to know what it was she 
was missing.

//Until now, ne?//

&quot;I want you to be happy. I can... I can give you whatever you want.&quot;

Of course, this is where it could all turn bad, where she could start 
screaming questions, angrily asking Lain what she meant, how the girl 
could possibly know these things, who knew what else. She could almost 
see the frightened tantrum play itself out in the air, the thick feeling 
of dread seeming to make every molecule, the entire restaurant, tremble. 
Arisu sighed, no - no, that outburst was not what she wanted and this 
hesitation, Lain&#39;s holding back was starting to give her a headache 
anyway.

//I&#39;ve grown up.//

&quot;Lain, tell me who you are. Tell me what you know. If I want anything, 
it&#39;s that. I forgot about you, I feel like I&#39;ve forgotten about so many 
things.&quot; Arisu nearly laughed, listening to herself, it almost sounded 
like a normal conversation.

The girl&#39;s wide, liquid eyes were heartbreaking, a hesitant shyness that 
cut Arisu to the quick. Now she knew the reason she had become Lain&#39;s 
friend, without a doubt - and she felt her hands gripping the sides of 
her chair, realized that now she was a bit worried. What could possibly 
make her run from someone that she realized now, she had cared for at 
first glance?

------------------------

Lain swallowed hard past a lump that wouldn&#39;t go away, the lines of 
nervous stress in Arisu&#39;s body all too visible.

//You can fix this, if she doesn&#39;t...//

/I don&#39;t want to./ She didn&#39;t want to reset this. Not again. Even if she 
could make things go back to the way they had been, to /any/ way, she 
didn&#39;t want to live through it again. /I don&#39;t want to lose her again./

She had thought it was just different, not really losing but changing, 
but Lain knew now that she had been wrong. Mere seconds with Arisu, just 
walking in silence, reminded her how wrong she was.

&quot;I thought I could just watch. I thought it would be enough, that it 
would all work, but it wasn&#39;t enough... and when I saw you, and when you 
were thinking about me...&quot;

&quot;Lain. Show me. Please.&quot;

So she did.

Lain heard the gasp but refused to look up, to see what expression might 
be on her friend&#39;s - //more than a friend// - face, afraid and guilty 
and much too hopeful, all at once. She knew what she had given Arisu, 
the memories playing back like a movie as she closed her eyes and let 
them come, gave them to the girl, her friend, the one who meant the 
world.

Who she was. What she was, and what Arisu had stumbled into then, how it 
had all been too big and too loud and too much to take in, terrifying 
and dangerous. How Lain had been part of the monster, wire metal and 
plastic and an unseen, unknown /frightening/ world that she just 
/couldn&#39;t/, just couldn&#39;t -

//I am a God, Arisu. The God of the Wired, and it was enough then. Just 
learning what I was, I thought I shouldn&#39;t interfere anymore. I 
understood what I could do, and what I had to do. You were afraid and so 
I thought...//

Resetting the world. Taking herself out of it, and for a long time it 
had solved the problem. No one had to be in pain, no one had to be 
afraid, especially not Arisu, the one who mattered most.

It wasn&#39;t fair to do, she knew it, but Lain felt her feelings bleeding 
through, coloring the memories with her own sorrows and she couldn&#39;t 
stop herself.

//I was lonely. I was lonely, and I... love you. I thought it would be 
enough to be near you, and to make sure you were happy, even if you 
didn&#39;t see me and never knew, but it wasn&#39;t. After so long, it wasn&#39;t, 
and when I saw that you weren&#39;t happy, I thought... I&#39;m sorry you have 
to, that I can&#39;t...&quot; Being God should have automatically made a person 
eloquent, Lain thought, it made everything seem much more convincing. &quot;I 
love you, Arisu. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

No answer. No words or sounds and she didn&#39;t dare try to reach out the 
way she could, to know instantly what Arisu was feeling, barely dared to 
open her eyes, though it was so hard to look up, so hard when all she 
wanted to do was listen to Arisu breathing, listen and pretend it would 
last forever. It /was/ different than just watching, and she missed it, 
how she missed -

Lain did look up, finally, when Arisu&#39;s hand closed over her own.

She saw the tears first, just a little shine against the girl&#39;s pale 
cheeks, spilling down in perfect drops, and she felt her heart 
constrict, crushed down marble hard and tight, and she didn&#39;t want to be 
a god anymore, not if this was all it could mean - but then Arisu 
squeezed her hand and she blinked and she saw the smile, the tears that 
were tears of joy.

Arisu smiling.

The waiter stepped up to take their lunch order.

The world reset itself.</pre>
