<pre>&quot;I&#39;m ho - ome.&quot;

Arisu sighed into the soft silence of the apartment, somewhat happy that 
there was no one to answer back. Sliding off her shoes before dropping 
her bag on the floor, she stretched, gazing around the empty room.

It wasn&#39;t that she&#39;d become a hermit, she still had plenty of friends 
and potential boyfriends, if she wanted to ask. Now, though, for some 
inexplicable reason, she felt the least alone when there was no one else 
around. It had taken her a long time to understand the feeling, calm and 
steady... as if she was connected to something greater, or that she had 
a guardian angel that just happened to hover a little closer than usual.

//I&#39;d think it was spiritual, maybe it is... or that I like nature, the 
wind and the sunlight, and it&#39;s just an extension of that - but it feels 
so... personal, somehow.//

It might have been some inner intuition, telling her to return to Japan 
for good, maybe explore a little further into her religious side on 
familiar soil. It wasn&#39;t as if she didn&#39;t like America all right, it was 
certainly an adventure - but at times it seemed that she hadn&#39;t 
succeeded, that whatever she&#39;d been expecting to find here still eluded 
her.

//No... that&#39;s not it. I didn&#39;t come here looking for anything - and 
anyway, I&#39;m needed here. I have to help close this deal, at least.//

Arisu the calm, confident businesswoman. It certainly seemed a long way 
from where she&#39;d started, where she&#39;d ever planned she might end up. If 
her first love hadn&#39;t turned out so wishy-washy, she might never have 
been motivated for more...

//First love...// Arisu took out the clips in her dark hair, watching in 
the mirror as it tumbled down around her face. Laughingly, she pouted 
for a moment like a model. //He was rather boring for a first love.//

&quot;Ah yes, but you are Arisu the supermodel... hah. What have you ever 
done that&#39;s been so exciting?&quot; She poked at the mirror, challenging it 
to answer. &quot;You&#39;re getting absentminded in your old age, Arisu, you&#39;ve 
never had much to talk about.&quot;

She sighed again, a little sadder this time, she wasn&#39;t old but it was 
coming, sneaking up closer and closer with every day that passed. It was 
true, her life wasn&#39;t very exciting, and she couldn&#39;t think of exactly 
when it had started to matter so much, that things were so mundane. 
Where had that carefree spirit of hers gone, and could she even get it 
back?

//Maybe this is what it means to grow up.//

The phone rang. Arisu grimaced at the annoying tone, she hadn&#39;t yet 
found a way to shut it off or even turn it down. Quickly, she unbuttoned 
her blouse, tossing down belt, skirt and the rest quickly, so that she 
wouldn&#39;t be tempted to cross the room and answer it.

&quot;Arisu? It&#39;s Ben.&quot; His voice was too loud and deep, and melted her name 
into a taffy blob. &quot;I was wondering if you&#39;d like to go out tonight. I 
thought I heard you were going back to Japan soon, so I figured you 
might want to enjoy a night out, see the sights? Call me back, all 
right?&quot;

Arisu sighed, drowning out the closing beep by turning on the shower. 
Ben liked her, if she went out she would probably have a wonderful 
evening. He would pay for everything, no doubt, wine and dine her and 
give her a goodnight kiss - a gentleman&#39;s date.

//... so?//

No one knew about most of these feelings, Arisu liked to keep her less 
happy moments private, but she was sure her friends would all agree, 
somewhere along the way her standards in dating had gone well past 
&#39;high&#39; into downright astronomical. She couldn&#39;t explain it, and she 
certainly hadn&#39;t ever been impolite, but all the men she had met, here 
or at home or even in studies abroad seemed to be lacking... something. 
Clich&eacute; as it sounded, she knew the problem wasn&#39;t with them, but herself 
- but what /was/ the problem, exactly?


After a long deliberation, Arisu had finally even forced herself into a 
gay nightclub, absolutely certain she had a glowing neon sign - &quot;does 
not belong here&quot; - over her head the entire night. Still, maybe there 
had been something she didn&#39;t see, something about herself she didn&#39;t 
know - and it had certainly been exciting, to be so completely out of 
her usual surroundings. It didn&#39;t seem to make things any better, 
though... none of the women she watched that night seemed any more 
intriguing than her male dates. No one interested her.

//As if it&#39;s their job to interest you, Arisu. It&#39;s all just a mid-life 
crisis, that&#39;s what it is.//

Arisu made sure the water was warm before jumping in, scrubbing with the 
soap determinedly, as if the action could somehow make up for the 
hesitant, waffling bent of her thoughts.

//Everyone goes through a point in their life like this, when they&#39;re 
not sure of what they&#39;re doing, or if what they did -//

Arisu stopped, watching the water run over her fingertips, washing away 
the soap suds, suddenly and completely lost in that thought. //What they 
did. What I did, something in the past?//

It wasn&#39;t as if she really thought about the past, there wasn&#39;t that 
much to remember, really. A normal childhood, school and clubs and 
friends...

Friends.

No, it wasn&#39;t as if much had happened, nothing apart from the normal 
teenage years... but there was something she was forgetting. Arisu knew 
it, could sense the split in her thoughts, and the nagging feeling she 
had left something behind, a memory she should have tried to place long 
ago.

//You think you have more intuition than you do, you know. It just 
sounds so pat, that if you could remember, it would change everything, 
that whomever you&#39;ve forgotten... that&#39;s what&#39;s missing. It probably 
isn&#39;t something all that important - you probably skipped a birthday 
card or forgot to call someone.//

Still, the feeling had become stronger lately, like a powerful dream on 
the verge of being remembered. Arisu found herself doing odd things, 
nothing anyone else would notice, but still odd. Leaving the Navi in the 
room on, all the time, though she barely touched the machine except for 
the occasional e-mail. It was like a beacon, one of those old-time 
lighthouses, left to call someone home.

//Call someone...?//

Arisu sighed, uncapping the shampoo and taking a deep breath, enjoying 
the few lush moments she had to herself in the shower, the way it felt 
safe and protected and -

//Lain.//

Arisu blinked, nearly jumped as the shampoo slid from her fingers, 
landing on the shower floor with a dull thud. It took her a moment to 
collect it, and to take hold of her strangely fluttering thoughts - it 
was annoying the way her body remained so steady, Arisu thought, her 
heart ought to have been racing, or at least she should have had the 
cold shivers.

//Lain. I knew a girl named Lain.//

Arisu did feel her heart start to pound, as a sudden, complete stillness 
seemed to fall around her, half-crouched with the water still falling 
down around her. She strained to hear past the patter, ears ringing with 
the resounding silence, as if the entire world were holding its breath, 
waiting... If this were a movie, this would be the &#39;Psycho&#39; moment - 
Arisu swallowed hard, reaching up, the rest of her body tensing to leap 
out of the way as she threw the shower curtain back, the steel rollers 
seeming to screech across her nerves - nothing.

A moment later, she realized how ridiculous it must have looked, grown 
woman crouching naked in her shower in a ludicrous fighting pose... and 
the shampoo was nearly dripping in her eye, too.

//You&#39;re getting water on the floor.//

Arisu rolled her eyes, drawing the curtain closed and quickly rinsing 
the rest of the shampoo out of her hair.

//Lain. Iwukara Lain, I remember her... but nothing else? No background 
at all.// It was strange, Arisu was sure there was more, but most of the 
memories seemed to be hiding. She could remember a girl, a little 
shorter than she was, quiet... dark hair worn in a somewhat original 
style, but very shy, childlike. The kind of girl to forget simply 
because nothing about her stood out.

//No, that isn&#39;t true.//

She paused, waiting, the strange heavy silence still filling the air - 
waiting, waiting for her, maybe... if this Lain was important, why 
forget about her?

//Maybe you wanted to forget.// Arisu frowned, now that just seemed 
silly. A girl, especially a girl like that, what could be so 
frightening?

Of course, who knew what might have seemed frightening to a high-school 
girl. She felt a moment of sudden guilt, betrayal - what if this Lain 
had confided in her? A real problem, pregnancy or drugs or something 
worse, and she hadn&#39;t been able to deal with it? She had run away rather 
than risk whatever horrible thing she thought might have happened?

//The monsters that were so scary in childhood, when you finally grow up 
and turn the lights on them, they&#39;re something else entirely.//

The older she became, the more Arisu thought that boredom was a worse 
feeling than the fear of the unknown. Realizing that her life was so 
small, and relatively tedious, really - she knew would have said 
something different to this Lain, if she had been the person she was 
now. One hand against the blank-feeling wall of the shower, Arisu turned 
the knob, speaking to herself for reasons even she couldn&#39;t explain.

&quot;I&#39;m not afraid anymore.&quot;

She froze, breath catching in her throat - noticing quite distinctly the 
feeling of water dripping off the backs of her calves, warm rivulets 
dividing into individual droplets - and a hand, small, pressed against 
her skin, just below her right shoulder.

Arisu didn&#39;t move, not until she could feel puffs of cool air coming in 
around the shower curtain, and the slightly sticky, tight feeling from 
her skin drying in the air.

Waiting... the whole universe was waiting.

//It&#39;s a hand, Arisu... and the fact that no one should be able to get 
into your apartment, let alone your /shower/... it&#39;s still just a hand, 
and it hasn&#39;t done anything to you. Nothing&#39;s happened yet.//

Arisu braced herself, and finally just swung around, eyes closed - 
snapping them open to find... nothing. She spent a long time later with 
her relief, trying to decide if it was really what she felt at all.
