<h1>Tears of Toys (part 1 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/albedoright.html">Albedo's right hand</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	The park of the Durandle was empty and quite, for the most part. A 
realian sat on a bench with her face cradled in her small hands. Her 
tears dripped from her fingers as her heart ached with every single 
pulse. In times of joy she would sit on this bench and look at the 
softly twinkling stars thinking of the one she loved. Now she could only 
cry, that was all her heart could bear to do at the moment. 
	For the past three days she would spend the night just crying in 
the darkness until she would fall asleep from exhaustion. Only one other 
person was there, someone who had watched her cry every night. The pink 
haired realian was so distracted by her own sadness she failed to see 
the person sit beside her. She didn&#39;t see the person but her sensors 
told her exactly who it was.
	&quot;KOS-MOS? Why are you here?&quot; The young realian asked not even 
looking up. The blue haired android spoke with logic driven words, 
	&quot;I don&#39;t understand your actions. For the past three nights you 
have come here and have acted in a way I don&#39;t quite understand.&quot; Even 
though her voice was monotone it seemed like there was some hint of 
kindness behind it.
	&quot;It is called crying KOS-MOS. People cry when they feel sad. Now 
can you please go away and leave me alone.&quot; The young realian spat in 
obvious annoyance, tears still streaming down her face.
	&quot;Why are you sad?&quot; The cerulean haired android asked tenderly. 
Momo was shocked at what she heard...was that kindness in her voice of 
did she just imagine it. Her tears stopped only out of fascination with 
the machine sitting in front of her. The realian looked down at her feet 
as she tried to force her lips to form the words that made her so sad.
	&quot;Jr....He...Doesn&#39;t love...He only wanted me because...because I 
looked like my sister.&quot; Momo broke into tears again.
	&quot;Sakura Mizrahi correct?&quot; KOS-MOS asked since technically Momo had 
a lot of sisters and Jr. could easy have gone for any of the 100 series. 
Momo crying intensified at hearing the name that brought her so much 
sorrow.
     &quot;Just please...leave me along KOS-MOS!&quot; The young realian 
whimpered, tears running through the gaps between her fingers. KOS-MOS 
didn&#39;t move at all,
     &quot;Surely I can help you in some way.&quot; Momo&#39;s annoyance was almost 
greater than her sadness and she couldn&#39;t hide it anymore. She spun her 
head to look at the android and yelled angrily 
     &quot;Just leave me alo...Mmm!&quot; Her words were cut off as her lips 
locked with KOS-MOS&#39;s. The gloved hand of the mechanical maiden stroked 
her cheek and the realian was at a loss for words. Her heart was racing 
and she didn&#39;t know what to do. That kiss seamed so innocent and 
caring...unlike his kiss.
     Momo broke the kiss and got to her feet, running out of the room. 
KOS-MOS simply stood there shocked. A new figure appeared as she ran out 
of the room and sat on the bench beside her, she asked,
     &quot;Why...why did she run?&quot; The teenager beside her simply replied,
     &quot;Don&#39;t worry, she has been through a lot and just needs some time 
to work things out.&quot; KOS-MOS sighed and held her hands on her lap.
     &quot;I would help her each time I got the chance in hopes she could see 
how I felt. I tried to cheer her up when she heard her creator was a 
madman, I offered to go down with Proto-Merkabah in her place, then she 
decided to go down helping the others escape. Then there was the little 
things I did for her that even she didn&#39;t seem to notice.&quot; The boy just 
looked out the window,
     &quot;Her heart is fragile at the moment, be gentle with her.&quot; His words 
seemed so full of wisdom that he couldn&#39;t be as young as he looked,
     &quot;You&#39;re right, thank you...chaos.&quot; She said softly, looking out the 
window at the twinkling stars. How long had they sat there just watching 
those tiny lights softly blink in the eternal night of space.
     &quot;Humans are so confusing...why did you give me these emotions?&quot; 
chaos looked like he was thinking deeply.
     &quot;I didn&#39;t give you those emotions, I simply released what was 
already there.&quot; KOS-MOS looked away from the abyss of space and to her 
own feet. Her eyes beginning to water as she spoke.
     &quot;Why three days ago? Why? These emotions are too much to bear! How 
can humans deal with them?&quot; She was crying just like Momo was and chaos 
put a hand on her shoulder. The warmth of his un-natural aura washed 
over her.
     &quot;From the first moment you saw her crying at this very bench oh so 
long ago, you fell in love. Even though you couldn&#39;t use such emotions 
at that moment you truly did love her. Now that you have a chance I want 
you to feel what love is, so that you can be truly human.&quot; KOS-MOS 
looked up at him; her tear stained cheeks reflected the soft glow from 
the small machines floating through the air. 
     &quot;Just give her a little time and she will understand how you feel 
for her, remember she has had her heart broken. She needs time to repair 
it before she can truly love someone else. Look, I&#39;ll do you a favor and 
talk to her. Maybe that will help.&quot; KOS-MOS through her arms around 
chaos using his shoulder to wipe her cheeks dry.
     &quot;Thank you chaos, you have done so much for me and yet there is no 
way I could possibly repay you.&quot; Chaos struggled for the words,
     &quot;Air...please!&quot; KOS-MOS had forgotten that she still had her 
mechanical body and that she was squeezing the air out of him. She 
released the grip and chaos then said,
     &quot;Look just don&#39;t loose the flame of love that glows in your heart. 
If you and Momo can help nurture that flame then you have done all you 
could possibly do for me.&quot; Chaos stood up and walked away towards the 
exit,
     &quot;Please...let the flame grow strong...just don&#39;t let it burn her. 
Hearts are too easily burned by the flames of passion.&quot; KOS-MOS just sat 
there, a soft, kind-hearted look that was still quite new to her. Her 
heart beating quickly at the thought of holding Momo in her arms. She 
wondered what her creator would think if she knew about this. Would she 
scold her or would she help her. 
     She knew from analyzing history files that two people of the same 
gender that were in love was usually a concept that people looked down 
on, but now a days there were no problem at all with such ideas.
     Then she soon realized something; it wasn&#39;t a love between two 
women but instead a love between two beings that aren&#39;t human. Is that 
still the same thing, a realian and an android...would that be 
acceptable in this society? Had it ever happened before? 
     She had thought these things before; each night she sat and watched 
the young realian cry herself to sleep each and every time. She 
contemplated her own feelings and if they were true as well as how Momo 
would react. She hadn&#39;t even planned to kiss her; she only wanted to 
stop her crying. Her heart ached knowing Momo was probably crying in her 
bed at the thought of that kiss.
     
     The next day when the whole group was having Breakfast, well Jr. 
actually wasn&#39;t there because he gave a half-assed excuse about too much 
paper work. Captain Matthew&#39;s had a hang over as usual and Tony was 
doing his best not to get yelled at. Shion was talking with Allen about 
some battle configuration for the 100-series realians. Ziggy simply sat 
there listening to every one since he didn&#39;t have to eat, that person he 
would normally talk to was Momo but she seemed too quite that morning 
and barely said a word to Ziggy.
     &quot;Are you alright Momo?&quot; Ziggy asked feeling the awkwardness between 
them. Momo drank some water and shook her head.
     &quot;Are you sure. You seem very closed off.&quot; Ziggy said putting a hand 
on her shoulder. KOS-MOS soon appeared, walking past the two and simply 
said,
     &quot;It would be best not to pry. I have calculated a 96.222217% 
probability that she will be able to come to terms with her dilemma on 
her own. Even KOS-MOS herself was starting to get annoyed about how she 
quoted variables like that. She wanted to act more human but knew that 
would only make Shion more fascinated with her, and that would probably 
cause problems with her task at hand.
     Momo had a spiteful look on her face and turned her head in the 
other direction. KOS-MOS sighed and simply kept walking. Remembering 
something chaos had said a week ago when he was teaching her to play 
poker.
     &quot;Remember KOS-MOS, you have to play your cards close to your chest 
so to not reveal your hand to the other player.&quot; She thought about that 
carefully and knew it was wise to keep such truths under wraps until it 
was the appropriate time. She couldn&#39;t help thinking of how Shion might 
react to such a truth.
     KOS-MOS reached the table Shion was sitting at and sat beside her 
with a blank look on her face. KOS-MOS couldn&#39;t help but watch the small 
realian. Shion was completely oblivious to KOS-MOS as she asked almost 
to herself.
     &quot;I wonder what is the matter with Momo?&quot; KOS-MOS had learned to 
dislike the way Shion spoke to herself over the last three days. &quot;Was 
Shion always so annoying?&quot; She inwardly thought. After an awkward minute 
of no one answering her, KOS-MOS finally spoke up.
     &quot;Momo told me that Gaignun Kukai Jr. called off their relationship 
a few days ago.&quot; Shion sighed,
     &quot;What a shame they looked like such a good couple.&quot; KOS-MOS 
inwardly sighed and thought inwardly, &quot;They always said that. They 
always ignored how Jr. seemed like a different person when Momo wasn&#39;t 
around.&quot; Shion thought for a moment.
     &quot;We should see him after he gets back from his mission and talk 
about it.&quot; KOS-MOS disliked the plan but since it included herself then 
maybe she could also get some answers.
     &quot;Well...It seems that he has just returned.&quot; KOS-MOS lied knowing 
he was on the Durandle the whole time. She accessed the ship&#39;s cameras 
and soon found him putting the moves on some poor 100-series realian, a 
cocky smirk was visible across his face.
     &quot;Then lets go meet him then.&quot; Shion said happily almost making 
KOS-MOS gag. The two of them stood up and began to walk out, but KOS-MOS 
stopped. Her sensors told her Momo was watching her, she turned her head 
to face the realian but Momo looked disgusted and turned away.
     KOS-MOS followed Shion out, hiding the sad look on her face. Shion 
kept babbling on about the couple and each word was like a gnosis 
smacking her across her face. KOS-MOS could barely stand it anymore but 
knew all too well that she couldn&#39;t tell her that she has emotions just 
yet.
     &quot;Oh hello Jr.&quot; Shion said almost oblivious to the sight before her. 
His palm was against the wall and his arm was straight and supporting 
all his weight. He leaned towards a 100-series realian probably making 
some pick up line related to his lack of height.&quot;
     As the U.R.T.V turned to look at the two the 100-series slinked 
away with a sad look plastered across her face. KOS-MOS was once again 
disgusted by JR&#39;s actions and wondered exactly how many of the new 
realians received the same attention.
     &quot;What is it?&quot; Jr. asked harshly looking rather annoyed.
     &quot;We heard that you and Momo broke up.&quot; Shion said.
     &quot;So...Oh I get it now. Ms. Nice-all-the-time wants to know why?&quot; He 
said putting his hands in his overcoat pockets still with the annoyed 
tone. He walked past Shion and stopped a foot behind her. &quot;I don&#39;t love 
her, how could I? She&#39;s not even human.&quot; 
     He walked off but KOS-MOS blocked his way. &quot;Shion. Get your little 
toy out of my way.&quot; He said in his annoyed tone. KOS-MOS simply asked,
     &quot;So is she simply a toy to you?&quot; Jr. walked past and said as he 
walked,
     &quot;Toys have many uses. Some Obliterate Gnosis, some observe space 
for any signs of the gnosis and some...well let just say that five 
minutes on the U.M.N network would tell you of there other uses.&quot; 
KOS-MOS had a look of disgust on her face that she couldn&#39;t even hide 
when Shion turned to look at Jr. as he turned a corner.
     Shion looked confused and turned on her connection gear. KOS-MOS 
grunted in disgust and walked away from the scientist who obviously led 
a sheltered life.
