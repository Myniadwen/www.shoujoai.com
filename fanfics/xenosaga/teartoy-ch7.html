<h1>Tears of Toys (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/albedoright.html">Albedo's right hand</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/teartoy-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>	Jr. wouldn&#39;t admit it to his brother but he was glad the black 
haired U.R.T.V. suggested putting a motor in his plastic raft. The small 
vessel was quickly moving as far away from the shore as possible towards 
the wall of the foundation. During times he didn&#39;t want to be seen he 
had installed a door at the other end of the artificial beach. 
	Not even Mary and Shelly knew of the Segment file doors he 
personally installed. Unfortunately even he had forgotten some of the 
doors he had built oh so long ago. He would sometimes spend the nights 
searching through the park for the door we&#39;re he kept his &quot;stash&quot; of 
explicit U.M.N. movies.
	The raft reached the door and he entered the three-digit code that 
was so obvious it hurt. He stood up on the raft and his foot fell out 
from under him and his back splashed into the water behind him. He flung 
his arms onto the raft completely unaware of the button he had hit.
	He pulled himself up and walked through the door hoping no one 
would notice a teenaged boy in swim trunks dripping down the hallways of 
the foundation.

	Shion noticed the rainfall and held up her hand to make sure she 
wasn&#39;t imagining the heavy shower. She ran out of the water the moment 
the clouds started to darken. She entered the change rooms leaving 
KOS-MOS and Momo alone in the heavy rain.
	Momo let go of the ball and swam through the elbow deep water 
towards KOS-MOS giving the android a nice view of her backside. Momo 
swam around her lover and sprang from the ocean water flinging her arms 
around KOS-MOS.
	The realian examined every inch of the android as rain pummeled 
both of them. Her cerulean hair clung to her neck, shoulders and back. 
Her pale complexion seemed paler with the lack of sunlight that was 
visible through the rain clouds.
	KOS-MOS could feel the realian&#39;s slender arms around her torso and 
could still feel her warmth even with the cold rain that drenched them.
	&quot;Come on you two!&quot; chaos could be heard clearly over the drone of 
the rain and they knew it was there cue since Shion could be out any 
minute.
	KOS-MOS turned to the shore but felt something against her. 
KOS-MOS couldn&#39;t explain the sensation she felt but enjoyed it and soon 
knew exactly what caused the feeling. What at first seemed like an 
innocent grazing of the realian&#39;s hand on her chest turned into a full 
embrace that was less innocent.
	Momo pressed herself close to KOS-MOS in order to hide from the 
distant onlookers of her small hand on the android&#39;s chest. KOS-MOS 
obviously didn&#39;t expect such a bold action from Momo and her pale skin 
was lit up like a red giant star.
	Momo sensed that Shion was about to exit the change room and 
pushed away from the android to keep there secret. Momo flashed a smile 
that was less innocent as it could have been, then ran towards the 
shore. KOS-MOS chased after here trying to calm her now racing mind and 
remove the bright shade of red plastered across her face.
	By the time they reached the shore, Shion was already standing 
there in her usual attire. Ziggy had pulled a beach umbrella out of the 
sand and held it over his mechanical body and looked slightly surprised 
when Shion stood close beside him to get out of the rain.
	Allen came running up to the group with his horrific green 
swimsuit on. No one seemed to ask how he came to the beach in his 
swimsuit. He also looked very disappointed when Shion told him that they 
were finished with the beach for today. 
	He walked over to the men&#39;s change rooms with chaos. Momo giggled 
realizing the Allen probably only came to see Shion in her new pink 
bikini. Shion seemed to be the only one that didn&#39;t know he had the hots 
for the nerd. 
	Shion took out her connection gear and pressed a few buttons. The 
familiar blue glow replaced KOS-MOS&#39;s swimsuit with her regular uniform.  
Momo wouldn&#39;t admit it but she liked the sight of KOS-MOS in that 
swimsuit.
	Momo walked towards the woman&#39;s change rooms trying to remove the 
image that played through her mind. She looked in the full length mirror 
and was finally pushed the image from her head and muttered,
	&quot;I didn&#39;t even have thoughts like this when I was going out with 
Jr.&quot; She looked at herself in the full-length mirror, her amber eyes 
tracing the lines of her synthetic flesh.
	She struck a pose for the mirror trying to look as seductive as 
possible. She pouted when the pose looked cute instead of sexy. Once 
again she felt trapped in her youthful body. She looked down at her 
permanently under-developed chest and brought her arms up making rough 
shape with her hands.
	&quot;I wish they were this big.&quot; She said before sighing loudly 
knowing the wish would never come true. She then began to change out of 
her swimsuit once again being reminded by her eternal youth. When she 
had finished she walked out to see everyone was ready to leave, but it 
was still raining. 
	She looked up at the stars through the glass walls of the 
foundation. It still rained even though the clouds had disappeared.
	A single star whizzed through the starry sky and Momo quietly 
murmured a wish upon that star.
	&quot;What was that Momo?&quot; Shion said hearing sound leaving her lips,
	&quot;Oh it&#39;s nothing Shion. Let&#39;s go back to the Elsa.&quot; Momo sighed 
once more looking over to the one she loved, knowing that she would 
always be thought of as a child.
