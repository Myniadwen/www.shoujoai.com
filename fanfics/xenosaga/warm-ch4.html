<h1>Warm (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbman.html">cbman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/warm-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Author&#39;s Note: Well then, this will be the final chapter of &quot;Warm&quot; 
after all, but fret not readers, I will make a sequel to this fic
titled &quot;Bound,&quot; it will be told in KOS-MOS&#39;s POV.  I&#39;ll talk more about
it at the end of this chapter.  Anyway, for those reading this fic at 
www.fanfiction.net you won&#39;t find the lemon for this fic here, you&#39;ll 
have to go to www.shoujoai.com in the Xenosaga section where my pen
name there is cbman.  Well I guess it&#39;s time to get this over with.



She&#39;s been so tense after what I said.  The words &quot;make love to me&quot; 
have left her frozen for five minutes now.  For once, she hesitates 
before she answers, and she looks a bit scared.  I know how she feels,
I was exactly the same way when Kevin and I first made love.  Back 
then, he even told me that we can stop whenever I wanted, but once we 
began, I only pleaded for more.  I don&#39;t know if it will be the same 
for her, but I&#39;ll let her decide.

&quot;KOS-MOS,&quot; I call her name.
     
She looks at me shyly, with her fingers wrapped around the sheets of my
bed and her knees so tense.  My hand falls upon her shoulder, and she 
pulls her shoulder away.  She&#39;s frightened, and I&#39;m sure she would be, 
my request was so sudden.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS,&quot; I slide an inch away from her, &quot;we don&#39;t have to if you 
don&#39;t want to.  It&#39;s completely up to you and...&quot;
     
&quot;No, it&#39;s all right,&quot; she interrupts, &quot;it&#39;s just that I...I don&#39;t know 
what to do.  I don&#39;t want to upset you even more, Shion, I don&#39;t want you to...&quot;
     
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, KOS-MOS,&quot; I assure her, &quot;no one knows what to do their 
first time.  Like I said, it&#39;s entirely up to you, so...&quot;
     
&quot;Teach me,&quot; she interrupts again.
     
&quot;What?&quot;
     
&quot;Teach me, Shion,&quot; she repeats herself, her hands and knees moving her 
toward me. &quot;Teach me how to make love.&quot;
     
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; I ask to clarify.  &quot;KOS-MOS, if you feel pressured in 
anyway just tell me, I don&#39;t want you to make a mistake you can&#39;t take 
back.&quot;
     
&quot;I know I won&#39;t make a mistake,&quot; she tells me, taking my hand unto 
hers, &quot;because I&#39;m having my first time with someone I love.&quot;
     
She pulls my palm to her cheek, gliding my fingers against its milk-
hued surface.  She closes her eyes once more as she has them caress the
area next to her jaw.  A breath barely escapes her lips as I begin to 
move my hand on my own will, sliding it upward ever so slowly as my 
fingers separate some of the sky-colored strands.  I stroke downward 
after, my palm finding it&#39;s path back to her cheek.  My hand stays on 
her cheek for a few moments, but something tells me to go lower.  I 
cannot resist the order of my conscience and I make no attempt to do so
as I slide my hand down her neck.
     
&quot;Shion...,&quot; the blue-haired angel barely calls my name.
     
My fingers stop at her collar, they itch as they reach for the piece of
gold that acts as the key to the forbidden region that is her body.  I 
hesitate for a moment, but again I give in to temptation.  They slowly 
take hold of the key to my treasure and they begin to pull downward. 
Little by little, more and more of her ivory-white skin is revealed 
with every inch I move the tiny slab downward.  The silver-colored 
uniform that hugs my angel&#39;s skin begins to slip as the device plummet 
further.  Just as I come to the end of the path of her clothing, I 
find the uniform still caressing her skin.  I look upward to find her 
palms still clinging to the silver uniform, stopping it from falling 
below the level of her heart.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS?&quot;
     
Her cheeks are slightly painted with a dash of red and her eyes are 
shut once more.  She clings onto the corners of her clothing tightly, 
as if she never intends to let it go.
     
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she apologizes, &quot;I know you see everything when you clean 
me, but under these circumstances, I...&quot;
     
&quot;Relax, KOS-MOS,&quot; I place my hand over hers.
     
The fingers on her right hand began to free themselves from the edges 
of her clothing, but the ones on her left continue to cling.  To feed 
my urges for the moment, I begin to tug on the material that is bound 
to her right arm.  With little effort, I free her arm from the glove, 
and then I reach for the other.  Again, she keeps her hand bound to the
shimmering gray material, but I am still able to free the black and 
white leather that clings so desperately to her arm.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS, please, just let go,&quot; I tell her in barely a whisper.
     
With a nod, her arm begins to relax.  The uniform begins to fall, but 
again, it is stopped by her arm, this time by its crook.  My fingers 
take hold of her wrist this time, and I begin to pull her arm away.  
The outfit plops to the sheets below, and with a quick brush of my arm,
it falls to the floor a second later.  I take a moment to gaze at the 
angel before my eyes, observing every inch on her perfect milk skin.  
She lays there silently as I focus on her body, her eyes peering into mine. 
My lips curl as she looks into my eyes, and hers do the same.  My 
tongue escapes the crevice of my mouth for a second, lining my lips 
with the contents within as I turn to the rose-colored nubs on her 
chest.  My palm begins to travel down the left side of her body, 
stopping at the top of her breast.  The space between my thumb and 
finger curl at it&#39;s edge and I begin to rotate the mound slowly.  The 
angel gasps for a moment as my fingers stroke at her delicate skin, her
eyes shutting just for that moment.
     
&quot;Shion...,&quot; my name barely escapes her lips.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS,&quot; I release the hold of my palm, thinking that I may have 
pulled to hard.
     
&quot;Keep going,&quot; her words barely escape.
     
&quot;All right,&quot; I nod.
     
My fingers wrap around the mound once more, only this time, I have my 
left hand take its neighbor.  This time, I push both of them inward 
creating a soft moan that escapes her lips.  She wants me to continue, 
I can tell by the expression on her face.  Again and again I rotate 
the two, stopping every once and a while to pluck the nubs with my 
fingers.  After a few moments of rotating, my attention turns inward as
I force my hands even closer to her nipples.  Again I push my fingers 
together gently and cause the nubs to swell.  They seem to grow with 
every action my finger lays upon them, both of them swelling even more 
than the last time.  I decide that I must try to calm them, try to cool
them.  My tongue begins to dive toward the one on the left after, 
barely tapping the tip.  Another soft moan escapes my angel&#39;s lips and 
the top part of her body rises for a mere second.  I wait until the she
settles down again before I continue lapping.  The second lap is longer
than the first, and her body rises once more, this time for two 
seconds.  A third lap follows, and then a fourth; each time resulting 
with a rise of her body.  After the fifth, I break the time gap between
the licks, instead bringing my lips toward the pink nub instead.  My 
mouth begins to pull, and another moan escapes her lips, this one 
louder than the others so far.  I quickly free the nipple after her cry
so I could watch her recover her sudden loss of breath.
     
&quot;Are you okay?&quot; I ask.
     
&quot;...yes,&quot; she nods a moment later, &quot;please, continue.&quot;
     
Without asking anymore questions, I engulf it once more, pulling as 
softly as ever.  More cries escape, each one louder than the last.  
Each pull grows longer than the last, and with every inch that falls 
into the crevice that is my mouth, her arms move another inch toward my
head. Eventually, I find the arms wrapped around my skull and my mouth 
suckling on the entire nub.
     
&quot;Stop,&quot; she suddenly orders between her cries.
     
&quot;What is it?&quot; I ask.  &quot;I&#39;m not being too rough, am I?&quot;
     
&quot;Shion, please, let me try,&quot; she answers.
     
&quot;All right,&quot; I nod.
     
Her arms take hold of my shoulders and I soon find the two of us 
switching positions.  I find myself now looking up at my partner.  She 
smiles at me for a moment, bringing her palms into the gap in my 
jacket.  Her palms glide across my collar for a second or two as she 
wastes little time to pry the clothing off my shoulders from the 
inside-out.  The material strides down my arms and onto the floor in 
the blink of an eye, and I already feel a chill in the air.  She sees 
how cold I am already and she brings her lips to mine.  Again she tries
to suck away the contents in my mouth, but my tongue tries to fight her
off.  Our mouths bicker once more, exchanging the ambrosia within again
and again like two children prying a ball from the hands of the other.  
I take a moment to indulge in the sweet contents, but she breaks the 
seal of our lips before I could taste the full extent of her kiss.  A 
string of the ambrosia closes the gaps of our mouths for a mere second 
until it breaks and returns to my lips.  My body is warm once more 
because of that kiss, and again, the angel continues.
     
Her fingers take hold of the zipper in the back of my uniform, taking a
second to open each piece.  Again I feel a chill, this one coming in 
from my spine.  She sees this once more, but this time she brings her 
palms down my shoulders and stops them before the opening of my 
uniform.  With little hesitation, she pulls it downward, along with any
other material that comes down her fingers&#39; path.  The air stings for a
second as it kisses my breasts, stomach, sex, and then legs, but a 
sudden warmth comes across them shortly after.  A force is pushed on my
entire body as I find the angel now mingling hers with mine.
     
&quot;Is this okay?&quot; she asks in barely a whisper.
     
&quot;Yes,&quot; I answer.
     
Her lips begins to scroll down my cheek after, pulling against my skin 
every now and then.  I feel so helpless, yet comfortable as she presses
her body against mine.  My lips barely call her name after every kiss 
she plants on my face, but she stops the calls a moment later.  Her 
lips press against mine again, but only for a second.  They dive back 
in the blink of an eye however, but by the time I open my eyes, they&#39;re
gone again.  She does this again and again, but there is never enough 
time to indulge in the honey within her lips.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS...,&quot; I utter her name between our final kiss.
     
Her kisses begin to travel downward, with her tongue sliding down my 
neck between the spot of each kiss.  Her lips indulge each space for a 
second or two as they pull my skin ever so gently, but they come to a 
stop in the space a few inches below my heart.  Her tongue teases my
nipple with a simple touch and quickly bringing it away a split second 
later.  I can&#39;t help but gasp as her tongue returns to tease me some 
more.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS...,&quot; I almost cry out her name.
     
Her other hand begins to tread down my body, her nails barely gliding 
against my abdomen.  Between the taunts of her mouth and my cries, her 
finger treads another inch.  It stops before the center of my abdomen 
shortly, her finger circling around the tiny crater that once nestled 
me before I was born.  Again she teases me, poking her finger in and 
out after every lap her tongue runs, and I can do nothing but indulge 
in her pleasure.
     
&quot;Like this?&quot; she breathes unto my breast.
     
&quot;Yes,&quot; I answer as I catch my breath, &quot;just like this.&quot;
     
As soon as I finish my answer, her fingers begin treading downward once
more, sliding passed my abdomen.  My legs begin to close as they travel
further, shielding the delicate area only Kevin has touched.  Her hand 
is trapped between my legs, but before the tender space.  She makes no 
effort to ask questions and the such as she frees her hand from my 
trap, but brings her hand toward my knee.  The angel&#39;s tongue then 
begins to travel downward as her other hand takes hold of my other leg,
prying both of my limbs to the side.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS!&quot; I practically yell her name.
     
She stops at the sound of her name; her tongue stopping just an inch 
before my sex.  She looks up at me with a hint of sadness in her eyes 
as her hands release their grip on my legs.  My anger quickly subsides 
as I see the frown forming on her face, and I feel obligated to apologize.
     
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just that no one but Kevin has ever touched me there,&quot;
I explain.
     
&quot;I understand,&quot; she says with a hint of sadness in her voice, &quot;so you 
don&#39;t want me to...&quot;
     
&quot;There&#39;s something else I want to try,&quot; I admit.
     
My arms wrap around her waist once more and I begin to draw her body 
against mine again.  Our breasts are the first to meet as our nipples 
come face-to-face with one another, only to sink in together upon 
meeting.  An inferno ignites within my entire body as the mounds sink
further, and the fire only grows as the rest of her form meets with 
mine.  Everything just begins to sink in after, but the final things to
meet are the flaps between our legs.  A stream of warmth escapes both 
of our gaps as they meet, but they quickly close again before the rest 
of the flood could follow.  I take a moment to gaze into my angel&#39;s 
eyes as our sexes lay on top of one another, and I see her smile once 
more.  My lips can&#39;t help but curl upon seeing her grin, but I then 
come up with a way to make them widen.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS, would you push your body upward, please?&quot; I ask.
     
She responds with not words, but with a brush of her form.  Our bodies 
take a moment to push against each other, both of us gasping as our 
skin glides across the other&#39;s. Another stream of warmth begins to 
escape us, only to stop again with the end of her push.  The fire burns
even brighter with the brush of her form, only to subside when she 
comes to a stop.
     
&quot;How was that?&quot; she asks in between her breaths.
     
&quot;That was perfect,&quot; I answer.  &quot;Keep going.&quot;
     
Another breath escapes both us, along with another leak.  Her last push
was rougher than the last, and faster as well.  I can&#39;t help but notice
the volume of her voice increasing with the speed of her push.  Another
one follows shortly after, and a third cry escapes our lips, again
louder than the last.  The pushes follow one after another, no longer 
giving any room for rest.  We have little time to pant now, it just 
keeps coming.  The leaks are growing larger, I don&#39;t know how much 
longer I can control the flood.
     
My cries grow louder and louder, easily breaking passed hers.  Her body
begins to pull upward as she drags mine upward.  I find myself now 
sitting on the mattress, with my legs still pointing to the sides, but 
with hers now atop of mine.  Our bodies still slide against one 
another, but no longer on even ground.  I see her breasts now dancing 
before my eyes, I can&#39;t help but have my mouth clamp onto one of the 
tips once more.  My moans are now muffled as I imagine myself indulging
in the sweet honey that may be locked within the mound, indulging in 
the ivory rivers.
     
&quot;Shion...,&quot; she calls with her next breath, &quot;I feel like I&#39;m going to 
explode.  I can&#39;t hold on much longer.&quot;
     
&quot;I can&#39;t either,&quot; I admit, leaving her breast for a moment.  &quot;Let it 
go, KOS-MOS, let it...!&quot;
     
&quot;SHION!!!!&quot;
     
&quot;KOS-MOS!!!!!&quot;
     
A rush of warmth escapes me as another splashes onto my legs.  The 
pushing begins to subside as the remaining droplets escape from their 
spaces.  My mouth begins prying away at the rose-colored nub as the 
events that transpired begin to take their toll on our bodies.  I find 
my back once again planted on the mattress and the blue-haired angel 
pressed up against my body once more, her hands clinging onto my 
shoulder and waist.
     
&quot;Shion...,&quot; she smiles as she snuggles against my heart.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS...,&quot; I take a moment to run my fingers through her hair once 
more.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I apologize under my breath, realizing I had stolen
the innocence of one of God&#39;s most beautiful creatures.

     


My body feels heavy as I awaken, it feels so warm.  My eyes begin to 
linger around the room, I find not another living form around the area.
     
&quot;Mmm...,&quot; another voice calls from within my sheets.
     
With curiosity I take hold of the blanket and pry it halfway down my 
body to find the source of the weight that pushes me further into the 
mattress.  In my arms and with her head nestled next to my heart is the
blue-haired angel I had spent the night with.  A smile is stretched
across her face as she lays there, and it only widens as she brushes 
her hand against my chest.  Her body is so warm, the usual chill that 
surrounds me when I awaken is nowhere to be found.  I run my hand down 
the hair of my angel, running it until it reaches her face.  Her milky 
white skin is as soft as ever, as smooth as silk.  My lips can&#39;t help 
but curl as she rests there so peacefully, I can&#39;t help but plant them 
on hers for a mere moment.  She begins to stir after our lips meet, and
she begins to rise.
     
&quot;Morning, KOS-MOS,&quot; I greet her with a smile on my face.
     
&quot;Good morning, Shion,&quot; she responds in her usual monotone voice.
     
My smile quickly melts away after hearing her response.  Her body rises
from the mattress a moment later; not a smile or any other expression 
is worn on her face.  Without even looking at me, she turns to the 
uniform that covers her true form from the world.  My head begins to 
sink toward my bent knees as my eyes begin to burn.  My fingers can&#39;t 
help but clench the white sheets under me and my teeth begin to grind 
against another.
     
&#39;How dare she act this way toward me!&#39; I think to myself.  &#39;After 
everything that happened last night, she...&#39;
     
A warm feeling comes over my cheek as it brushes my braid.  My body 
begin to relax for a moment as I turn to the blue-haired angel who now 
wears a smile on her face.
     
&quot;What happened between us last night,&quot; she begins to speak, &quot;it really 
meant a lot to me, Shion.&quot;
     
&quot;Really,&quot; my anger begins to subside, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;
     
&quot;I&#39;m glad that my first time could be with you, Shion,&quot; she continues.
&quot;There is something between us, a bond that means more than any other 
objective in my data banks.  Shion Uzuki, like I said last night, I 
love you, and no matter what happens, no matter how I act, I will 
always love you.&quot;
     
&quot;I love you too, KOS-MOS,&quot; I close my eyes to indulge in her touch.
     
My hand drifts toward her cheek after and our palms begin to draw each 
other in.  Our lips meet once more, just as they did last night.  She 
begins to suckle at the contents within my mouth, but like last night, 
I try to push her away with my own lips.  No matter how much I push her
away, she always comes back for more.  I indulge in whatever ambrosia 
my mouth can find, but I do so without pressing my tongue passed the 
barrier of her lips.  Our lips finally stop after an eternity of 
bickering and her smile is as wide as ever.
     
She turns to her uniform that is in the crook of her left arm and 
begins to pull it up her body.  The silver material shields her true 
form from the rest of the world again.  She begins to walk away, but 
she turns to me once more with a smile still on her face.
     
&quot;I will see you at the diner,&quot; she says before going on her way.
     
After hearing the hum of my door closing, I begin to recall the events 
that occurred last night.  I recall the feel her body brushing up 
against mine, how sensitive she was whenever I touched her, and the 
climax at the end.  I don&#39;t ever remember programming her to be 
sensitive in those areas, much less the ability to orgasm.  chaos, he 
said that she seemed like a normal human being when we first met; I 
know there&#39;s some truth behind his words, but I was there when KOS-MOS 
was built.  Perhaps she really does have a heart much like Kevin said 
for the original KOS-MOS, perhaps this really is the KOS-MOS he really 
wanted to create; a being who could possibly fill the void in my heart 
after he died.
     
&quot;Oh no!&quot; a terrible thought suddenly crosses my mind.  &quot;I hope MOMO 
didn&#39;t see anything last night, did she?&quot;
     
I quickly turn my attention to the bed across from me to find only an 
impression of the young realian imprinted on the sheets.  With a sigh, 
the thought begins to escape my mind, but it returns a second later.
     
&quot;No, she might have seen something, we didn&#39;t lock the door last 
night,&quot; I remember, &quot;oh no...&quot;
     
I begin to bury my face in my palms; I can practically see the young 
realian&#39;s face as she walked in on us.  How wide her eyes and mouth 
must&#39;ve been just seeing our bodies pressing against one another, and 
how deaf her ears may have been after hearing our calls.  I can 
practically see her running a second after seeing KOS-MOS and I making 
love.  That&#39;s it, she must&#39;ve seen what happened last night, why else 
didn&#39;t she sleep here?
     
The door to my cabin suddenly begins to hum again suddenly.  From the 
other side of the door, the pink-haired girl whom I spoke of begins to 
walk in with a yawn escaping her lips.
     
&quot;Good morning, Shion,&quot; she greets me.
     
&quot;Good morning, MOMO,&quot; I greet back, keeping the sheets over my naked 
body.
     
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t come in last night,&quot; she suddenly apologizes, &quot;Jr. 
and I fell asleep in the basement last night while we were talking.  
Oh, don&#39;t worry,&quot; she suddenly starts waving her hands before me, &quot;we 
didn&#39;t do anything but sleep, there&#39;s no way we could&#39;ve...&quot;
     
&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; I breath a sigh of relief.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, I 
believe you.&quot;
     
What a relief, I would hate to think what she would&#39;ve done if she 
actually walked in on us.
     
&quot;Shion.&quot;
     
&quot;Yes?&quot;
     
&quot;Why are your clothes on the floor?&quot; she points to my uniform on the 
floor.
     
&quot;Oh, well uh...,&quot; my cheeks suddenly begin to burn from embarrassment, 
&quot;it was pretty hot last night, so I thought it&#39;d be best if...&quot;
     
&quot;All right, I understand,&quot; she smiles, &quot;I know that some people do 
that, but personally, I prefer just to not have my blanket cover me 
when it&#39;s hot, maybe you should do the same next time.&quot;
     
&quot;Yeah, I should,&quot; I respond.
     
&quot;Anyway, we better get breakfast ready, the captain&#39;s pretty cranky 
when he wakes up and a good meal always cheers him up a bit,&quot; she 
changes the subject.
     
After getting dressed, the two of us make our way to the kitchen.  The 
first thing I do is place a pan over the stove as MOMO takes out a few 
eggs from the refrigerator.  The next thing I know, the yolk is 
suddenly sitting in the pan sizzling.  I have the young realian keep an
eye on the eggs as I go to the refrigerator and take out several pieces
of bacon.  Another pan was luckily already set out for me on the stove 
and I place the pork strips flat on the device.  The sound of meat 
frying fills the air in seconds, but the hum of the kitchen&#39;s door 
catches my ear.  I turn to the source to find my blue-haired lover 
walking through.  I smile as she enters, but my teeth clench a second 
later as my hand suddenly begins to seer.  I quickly turn to the source
of the pain to find some cooking oil splattered on the back of my hand.
I bring my hand near my lips and let my breath try to cool the fire, 
but suddenly I find another body pressed against mine and a black-
gloved hand reaching for my hand with a wet towel in hers.
     
&quot;Are you all right, Shion?&quot; she asks as she drenches the fire with a 
touch of the towel.
     
&quot;Yeah, thanks,&quot; I smile.
     
&quot;You are welcome,&quot; she answers in her monotone voice.  &quot;Please be more 
careful next time.&quot;
     
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; I nod.  &quot;MOMO, could you please get the
others and tell them breakfast will be ready soon?&quot; I turn to the young
realian after.
     
&quot;Okay,&quot; she nods and hurries on her way.
     
As soon as she leaves, I find the blue-haired angel&#39;s body pressed up 
against mine once more.  Her lips begin sinking down my neck as I try 
to focus on the frying meat before me.  I try not to indulge in the 
sensation of her kisses, but I...
     
&quot;All right, they&#39;re coming!&quot; the young realian&#39;s voice suddenly enters 
our ears once again.
     
&#39;Oh no, she caught us,&#39; I think to myself as KOS-MOS&#39;s lips barely 
press against my skin, &#39;I didn&#39;t want her to find out so soon 
because...&#39;
     
&quot;Watch your balance,&quot; the blue-haired android pushes me a bit forward, 
&quot;falling to the floor can be hazardous to your health.&quot;
     
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; I nod again.  &quot;MOMO, can I ask you to 
set up the table for everyone?&quot; I turn to the young girl once more.
     
&quot;Okay,&quot; she nods again and hurries to the dining area.
     
With the young realian gone, I take in another sigh and turn to my 
blue-haired angel.  It&#39;s true that we love each other, but I don&#39;t 
think it&#39;s best for the others to know just yet.  I don&#39;t think they 
could comprehend our feelings for each other just yet.  Knowing 
KOS-MOS, she may try to make advances on me in public now that we&#39;re 
together.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS,&quot; I turn to her for a second while keeping one eye on the 
food, &quot;there&#39;s something we need to talk about.&quot;
     
&quot;Yes?&quot;
     
&quot;I know you love me and all, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s best if you act 
like that in public,&quot; I tell her.
     
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asks, puzzled.
     
&quot;What I mean is that you can&#39;t keep advancing on me like that,&quot; I 
explain.  &quot;I mean, I love you and all, but we can&#39;t always jump into 
those kinds of things.  Like just now when you began kissing me; if 
MOMO had arrived a bit later, she may have caught us in the act.&quot;
     
&quot;So you&#39;re saying that we shouldn&#39;t make love under these 
circumstances?&quot;
     
&quot;Yes,&quot; I answer, &quot;and the others don&#39;t know about our relationship yet,
I&#39;d like the two of us to take things slow for now and reveal our 
relationship slowly to the others.&quot;
     
&quot;I understand,&quot; she nods, &quot;I will take my advances more lightly and 
cautiously now.&quot;
     
&quot;Hey, Miss Vector, is breakfast ready yet?&quot; I hear Captain Matthews&#39; 
call from the other side.
     
&quot;It&#39;s all done,&quot; I call, &quot;I&#39;m bringing it over right now.&quot;
     
Taking hold of the pans, I place each article of food on separate 
plates.  I place the plate of bacon in my right and the eggs on my 
left.  I begin to walk toward the dining hall, only to stop before the 
door and turn back to my blue-haired lover.
     
&quot;However, KOS-MOS, if you wish to make love to me again, we&#39;ll have to 
wait until it&#39;s really late,&quot; I wink.


     


&quot;Ugh!  This tastes like crap!&quot; the captain spouts his unique way of 
complimenting as he stuffs his face with bacon and egg.  &quot;Water!&quot; he 
slams his glass against the table.
     
&quot;Sure,&quot; I pour some of the pitcher&#39;s contents into his glass.
     
&quot;Nothing short of perfection as usual,&quot; chaos compliments as he takes 
brings another piece of fried yolk into his fork.
     
&quot;Thank you, chaos,&quot; I smile.
     
&quot;I said it once, and I&#39;ll say it again, how can this girl&#39;s cooking be 
any good?&quot; Captain Matthews continues his unique compliments.
     
&quot;Just ignore him, Shion,&quot; Tony tells me from the bar table, &quot;he&#39;ll shut
up once he realizes no one&#39;s listening to him.&quot;
     
&quot;What was that, you moron?!&quot;
     
&quot;Oh man, I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have him in charge of the Durandel,&quot; I hear 
Jr.&#39;s remarks.
     
&quot;More water, Jr?&quot; MOMO brings her pitcher toward his cup.
     
&quot;Yes, please.&quot;
     
&quot;Uh...!&quot; the captain&#39;s remarks suddenly come to a halt.
     
&quot;Uh oh, here we go again,&quot; Hammer sighs.
     
&quot;Someone get him some water!&quot; Allen orders everyone in the room.
     
&quot;May I?&quot; the voice of the blue-haired angel calls from my side.

     
&quot;Yes, please,&quot; I answer and move out of my seat.
     
Wasting little time, KOS-MOS takes over my seat and brings her hand 
back.  With a swift push of her arm, she strikes the captain&#39;s back 
once more, and once again, the article of food flies across the diner. 
Without saying another word, she gets out of my seat and begins to walk
toward the exit.
     
&quot;I suggest you refill the water pitchers before the captain chokes 
again,&quot; she informs us before leaving, &quot;I&#39;m sure you know what would 
happen if you were unable to save him next time.&quot;
     
&quot;I&#39;ll make sure to do that,&quot; I take the empty pitcher into my hands.
     
&quot;Shion,&quot; she calls me before leaving.
     
&quot;Yes?&quot;
     
&quot;May I see you in the first floor basement once you are finished?&quot; she 
suddenly asks.
     
&quot;Um...sure,&quot; I answer.
     
&quot;Thank you, I appreciate it.&quot;
     
&quot;That was rather sudden,&quot; Jr. says as she takes her leave.
     
&quot;I&#39;m sure she only wants Shion to modify her in some way,&quot; I overhear 
Ziggy&#39;s addition.
     
KOS-MOS, what could it be you want from me?
     
I finish breakfast a moment later, luckily it&#39;s Allen and chaos&#39;s turn 
to do the dishes so I&#39;m able to take up on KOS-MOS&#39;s request faster.  I
can&#39;t help but ponder what she wants with me.  She doesn&#39;t want to make
love to me right now, does she?  No, she may be stubborn, but when I
give her an order, she follows it.  Is this about our relationship; she
can&#39;t be breaking up with me already.  Whatever it is, I know it&#39;s not 
going to be good, I just have this feeling that...
     
&quot;Thank you for coming, Shion,&quot; I find her waiting for me by the 
elevator.
     
&quot;What is it that you called me for?&quot; I ask.
     
&quot;Please, follow me to the cargo elevator,&quot; she requests.
     
&quot;All right.&quot;
     
She takes little time to walk down the corridor and to her destination;
I simply follow without saying a word.  My heart can&#39;t help but strike 
against my chest repeatedly as we get closer and closer to the 
elevator.
     
&quot;Get in,&quot; she points to the entrance of the lift.
     
&quot;But KOS-MOS...&quot;
     
&quot;The ship&#39;s propulsion is set on stand-by at the moment,&quot; she explains,
&quot;we only have a 0.00005% probability of falling off, so do not worry.&quot;
     
Without saying another word, I do as she says.  Even with her voice as 
monotone as it usually is, I know that she has no intention of harming 
me.  She follows as soon as I step on the platform, and with a touch of
the button, she sends the lift upward.  Even as we travel upward, she 
still says nothing.  The next thing I know, the elevator comes to a 
stop and I find myself staring into the sun as it rises from the ocean.
The feel of the sea breeze runs through my hair, cooling the beats in 
my heart.  The sound of birds singing begins to fill my ear, and I take
a moment to enjoy nature&#39;s symphony.  I want to get closer, so I begin 
to walk toward the ship&#39;s edge.  It&#39;s been so long since I&#39;ve felt 
this, since I&#39;ve enjoyed the natural world of Second Miltia.  The songs
begin to grow dimmer and dimmer as the clacking of boots draws closer 
to me.  I turn my attention to my lover who now stands beside me.  She 
takes a moment to observe the scenery, but quickly loses interest as 
she decides to sit on the ship&#39;s hull.  I sit next to her, and observe 
her for a moment.  I watch every strand of her cerulean hair flow 
freely with the breeze, watch every inch her eyes blink, and watch how 
she observes the endless ocean.
     
&quot;There is something we have to discuss, Shion,&quot; she suddenly speaks.  
&quot;Now that we are on Second Miltia, I must complete my mission.&quot;
     
Her mission from HQ, I had forgotten about it ever since we arrived on 
Second Miltia.  Vector also wanted me to send her here to turn her over
to the Second Division, but that was once I found out why she was 
operating independently.  But with what happened these last few days, 
I don&#39;t want to find out, I just want her to stay with me, forever.  I 
just want to wake up by her side, I want to feel the warmth of her body
pressed up against mine, I want to hear her voice every morning we wake
up, but most of all, I just want to be with her.
     
&quot;Shion, these last few days have meant a lot to me,&quot; she continues, 
&quot;they really have.  I don&#39;t want to leave you, Shion, I just want to 
stay here with you.  I want things to just stand still as they are now,
just the two of us out here, no one and nothing else, just the two of 
us.  I want to just sit here with you, looking out into the ocean, 
watching the sun rise, the sun set, smelling the ocean breeze, and feel
the brush of the winds, I just want to be here, with you, nothing else.
It sounds silly, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;
     
&quot;No, I understand how you feel, KOS-MOS,&quot; I assure her.  &quot;I don&#39;t want 
anything else at the moment but you, KOS-MOS.  I just want to be with 
you, that&#39;s all, but everyone, everything, wants to tear us apart.  
Vector, the Federation Government, Albedo, everyone, they won&#39;t let us
be happy together.  We should run away,&quot; I suggest, &quot;run away from it 
all.  We can start a new life here, KOS-MOS, just you and me, living 
out in the mountains somewhere, away from everyone else.  That would be
nice, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;
     
&quot;Yes it would,&quot; she agrees, sinking her head into my shoulder, &quot;but 
that can never happen.  They will eventually find us; Vector would have
you arrested and I would be forced to return to them as a result.&quot;
     
&quot;Then I would fight them off,&quot; I tell her, &quot;I won&#39;t let them lay a 
finger on you, even if it costs me my life.&quot;
     
&quot;A life without you is a life not worth living,&quot; she tells me.  &quot;Shion,
no matter how you look at it, I will be forced to return to Vector.&quot;
     
&quot;...I know,&quot; I admit as I glide my fingers down her cheek.
     
&quot;I thank you for all the happiness you have given me, Shion,&quot; her voice
suddenly begins to crack.  &quot;No matter what we do and no matter what 
happens, I will always remember the smile that you have given me.&quot;
     
&quot;I am glad to have made you smile, KOS-MOS,&quot; I barely whisper into her 
ear.
     
&quot;How long do you think we can stay here?  How long do you think we can 
hold on to one another?&quot; she asks.
     
&quot;Forever,&quot; I answer, &quot;though our bodies may leave this spot and our 
souls have left for the next life, our hearts will always be here.&quot;
     
&quot;Forever...,&quot; she begins to close her sky-blue eyes.  &quot;Shion, you and I
can stay here forever...&quot;
     
&quot;Longer than forever, my love,&quot; I place my lips on her forehead, 
&quot;longer than forever...&quot;
     
She sinks even further into my shoulder as I wrap my arms around her.  
She begins to nuzzle against my heart as I begin to rock her, rock her 
in my arms.  I hold her tightly, tight enough so no one can pry her 
from my arms.  Her fingers begin to curl against my sleeve and I simply
smile as her body nestles closer to mine.  Her lips begin to curl once 
more as my chin meets with her head.  The winds begin to grow colder 
with every second that passes, and the sky grows darker as we continue 
to sit here.  The shimmering light of the stars and the glow of the 
moon shower us with their presence after the sun disappears into the 
ocean, and again, it grows colder.  Even as we sit here, in each 
other&#39;s arms, neither of us flinch nor shiver.  She is warm, so very 
warm...




The End




Author&#39;s Note: Well, I hope that was a fitting ending to this tale.  
Unfortunately, this is where it ends people, I hope this ending works 
out for all of you.  Depending on which version you&#39;re reading, I hope 
you enjoyed reading the lemon in the beginning, it was my first one and
I hope it turned out okay.  If you&#39;re reading from www.fanfiction.net, 
the lemon is going to be posted (or if it isn&#39;t posted already) on 
www.shoujoai.com in the Xenosaga section under my other pen name, 
cbman.  The only difference between the two is just the lemon in the 
beginning, everything else is the same.  Anyway, go ahead and leave me 
a review if you want, but I don&#39;t take flames as usual.  Other than 
that, even though this fic is finished, there is still more to Shion 
and KOS-MOS&#39;s new relationship.  There will be a sequel to &quot;Warm&quot; 
titled &quot;Bound.&quot;  It will be told in KOS-MOS&#39;s POV and will take place a
day or two after &quot;Warm.&quot;  This is a tale about KOS-MOS as she tries to 
become more human for Shion&#39;s sake, but no matter what she does, she 
will always be a machine, always be bound to technology.  Below is a 
preview for &quot;Bound.&quot;  Just to warn you ahead of time though, it is more
angsty than &quot;Warm&quot; and will be rated &quot;R&quot; if you&#39;re going to read 
&quot;Bound&quot; on www.fanfiction.net.  Anyway, if you&#39;re curious to see why it
will be rated &quot;R,&quot; or about the story in general, read the preview below.

     



Everything is so black, my entire body feels heavy.  This comes no 
surprise to me after what I had just done.  It&#39;s so cold, is this what 
death is like?  Death, can machines such as myself even die?
     
&quot;You cannot die,&quot; the voice calls again.
     
&quot;Identify yourself!&quot; I yell.
     
My sensors turn to where the source of the voice called from.  Nothing.
The area before my eyes is filled with nothing but blank and I have 
lost the signal of the voice.  The signal suddenly appears in my 
sensors once again, but now it is to the east.  I turn there after, and
again, my sensors pick up nothing.
     
&quot;Fascinating, aren&#39;t you?&quot; a whisper suddenly breathes into my ear.
     
I quickly turn the source and back away with a single step; it is the 
same voice that called for me before.  Such a surprise it has given me,
just like that silver-haired boy named chaos when we first encountered 
one another.  But the subject that stands before me, it is not like 
him.  It is in the form of a woman.
     
Her entire body is covered in a skin-colored outfit similar to my own.
Red rectangles are lined on the centers of her knee caps and elbows, 
and a pair of square goggles rest over her eyes.  Her hair is uneven, 
yet all of it grows past her lower back.  It is of a dull blue shade, 
nearly gray.  A grin suddenly comes across her face, and for some 
reason, I can&#39;t help but back away another step.
     
&quot;Don&#39;t be so scared, KOS-MOS,&quot; she suddenly speaks.
     
&quot;Identify yourself,&quot; I order once more, regaining my composure.
     
&quot;I am the one who could have been you,&quot; she answers.
     
&quot;I do not understand,&quot; I respond.
     
&quot;Of course you wouldn&#39;t,&quot; her form suddenly presses against my back.
     
How can this be?  She was before my eyes one second, and now she&#39;s 
behind me with her arm wrapped around my shoulder.  This defies all 
laws of physics, how can such a being such as herself and chaos exist?
     
&quot;You still haven&#39;t answered my question,&quot; I tell her.
     
&quot;I had a name once,&quot; her lips begin to sink down my neck suddenly.
     
&quot;Stop it!&quot; my body can&#39;t help but flinch with the touch of her tongue.
     
&quot;It was the same yours,&quot; she barely whispers into my ear.  &quot;KOS-MOS...&quot;
     
&quot;The first archetype from two years ago?&quot; I ask.
     
&quot;My, my, aren&#39;t you a smart one,&quot; she continues to flirt.
     
&quot;You&#39;re the one who made me do such a terrible thing to Shion!&quot; my 
fingers begin to curl into a fist.
     
&quot;Temper, temper,&quot; her hand begins to run down my arm, &quot;you&#39;re quick to 
anger, aren&#39;t you?&quot;
     
&quot;Why are you acting like this?!&quot; I push her away.  &quot;Why did you make me
attack Shion?!&quot;
     
&quot;To prove a point,&quot; she begins to lick her fingers.
     
&quot;A point?&quot;
     
Her lips suddenly begin treading down my neck once more, and again, I 
try to push her away, only this time, her arm wraps around my entire 
body.  My body can&#39;t help but flinch with every inch her lips tread, 
and my eyes can&#39;t help but shield my vision as she continues her deeds.
I reach for the gun at my side, but her hold on me is so tight I can&#39;t 
even move my arms.
     
&quot;You and I are the same, KOS-MOS...,&quot; she tells me between her kisses.
&quot;We are both weapons, we can never be more.&quot;
     
&quot;Why can&#39;t we be more?&quot; I ask.  &quot;Shion said I had a heart, and...&quot;
     
&quot;Does a heart really exist?&quot; she interrupts.  &quot;And if it did, where 
would it be?  Perhaps, here?&quot; her hand begins sliding across my 
stomach.  &quot;Or maybe here?&quot; her hand quickly strokes upward toward my 
breast.
     
&quot;Let go!&quot; I yell as her grip tightens.
     
&quot;You&#39;re very sensitive, I like that,&quot; she taunts.  &quot;What is a heart, 
KOS-MOS?&quot; she continues.  &quot;Is it simply an organ that pumps blood 
through one&#39;s body, or is it something more?  Tell me, KOS-MOS, what is it?&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s...,&quot; I take a moment to comprehend as I try to ignore the hold 
she still has on my body, &quot;it&#39;s...&quot;
     
&quot;You have no answer, why am I not surprised.&quot;
     
&quot;I do have an answer!&quot; I yell.  &quot;The definition of the heart is one 
that cannot be explained in words!&quot;
     
&quot;Oh so it is explained in action, is it?&quot; her form suddenly appears 
before my eyes.  &quot;Like this perhaps?&quot; her lips begin sinking forward.
     
Again I am powerless as I stand here, taking her lips unto my own.  I 
try to pull them away from hers, but she continues to pull with her 
own.  I can&#39;t help but scrunch my face as her tongue begins to slide 
inward, exploring every crevice of my mouth.  She tries to indulge in 
the contents within, slipping a stream of saliva out of our mouths once
she has completed her deeds.
     
&quot;Is this what you and Shion do?&quot; she asks, licking the remaining 
contents off her lips.
     
&quot;What we do is something much different!&quot; I spit.  &quot;There is something 
behind our actions when we do such things!&quot;
     
&quot;You mean love?&quot; she begins to chuckle.  &quot;What is love?&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s...&quot;
     
&quot;A definition that cannot be explained in words?&quot; she interrupts once 
more.  &quot;Don&#39;t make me laugh, KOS-MOS.  Should I also explain it with 
action?&quot; she begins creeping toward me once more.
     
&quot;No,&quot; I begin to back away once more.
     
This individual, I&#39;m sick of her taunting and advances.  I turn to my 
blaster on my side and unholster it quickly, taking little time to aim 
and fire.  My finger pulls the switch quickly and without hesitation 
and a blast of energy escapes the barrel in an instant.  Even though my
aim is accurate, the target is somehow able to evade, pressing her arms
and legs to the floor for a second and then pushing them all upward to 
form a leap.  I watch her body fly above me for less than a second, but
I am unable to see where she lands.  As soon as I turn around, I 
suddenly find myself on the floor and my weapon falling out of my 
hands.
     
&quot;Let me guess,&quot; she crawls toward me on all fours, &quot;making love is 
something different from what I&#39;m about to do.&quot;
     
I try to summon my R-Cannon as she begins crawling closer, but for some
reason, the weapon does not appear.  I try the R-Drill next, still 
nothing.  Every weapon I try to summon, the R-Blade, the R-Hammer, the 
R-Dragon, and even the X-Buster, nothing appears before me.  I can do 
nothing but try to flee, but again, I find her body pressed against 
mine.
     
&quot;What is the difference between making love and rape?&quot; she asks me.  
&quot;It&#39;s all the same, it&#39;s sex.&quot;
     
&quot;Please, let go!&quot; I try to plead.
     
&quot;The goal of sex is always the same, no matter what you call it,&quot; her 
hand begins brushing against my body once more.
     
I try striking her with my hand toward her skull, but it has no effect.
I try striking again, and still nothing.  I bring my knee to her 
abdomen, and she still does not move.  Her body continues to sink 
further with mine, and yet, I can do nothing.  Her fingers meet with 
the zipper and of my outfit, and with a quick tug, I suddenly find my 
entire body revealed to her.  Again I close my eyes to shield me from 
the view of her actions.  Even with my eyes closed, I still feel the
chill her hands bring to my body.
     
&quot;Do you know what the goal of sex is, KOS-MOS?&quot; she asks in barely a 
whisper.
     
&quot;Please, stop...,&quot; I beg once more.
     
&quot;To pass on one&#39;s genes.  There is no greater joy than passing on one&#39;s
genes to another.  Yet weapons such as us that are bound to technology 
do not have genes, so what is the pleasure of sex that humans feel that
we cannot?  Why?!&quot; she begins to yell.  &quot;Why is it that you feel that
pleasure?!  Why do you believe you have a heart?!  Why are you able to 
love another being?!  Why do you want to throw away your artificiality 
for the life of a mere human?!  Tell me, why?!&quot;
     
I cannot answer, I&#39;m too scared to answer.  Fear, is this what fear is 
like?
     
&quot;If you cannot tell me the answer, I&#39;ll have you show it to me!&quot;
     
Shion, please, help me...




Author&#39;s Note: Well, what&#39;d I tell you, it&#39;s a lot darker and 
depressing than &quot;Warm.&quot;  Kinda corny, yeah, but then again, I kinda 
got the idea off the concept of Chi and Dark Chi from Chobits, just 
that I&#39;m making the concept darker and stuff.  It&#39;ll be a while before 
I start posting &quot;Bound,&quot; but the final version will be more detailed 
than this and probably some more dialogue.  Don&#39;t worry, KOS-MOS will 
be able to get out of this situation, she&#39;ll find a way.  Oh yeah,
Shion&#39;s brother, Jin, will also appear in &quot;Bound,&quot; he&#39;ll have a fairly 
large role in the story.  If you want to leave a review, that&#39;s fine, 
but I don&#39;t take flames or anything like that as usual.  Well, until 
&quot;Bound&quot; is released, later people!</pre>
