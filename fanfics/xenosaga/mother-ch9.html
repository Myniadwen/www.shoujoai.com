<h1>Mother (part 9 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbman.html">cbman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/mother-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>XenoMark&#39;s Note: Recently I just saw the new info and trailer for 
Xenosaga Episode 3, and well, I have to say that I hope this new episode 
is better than episode 2. Anyways, after learning some info on the game 
and seeing the first few screenshots and trailer, I have to say that 
I&#39;ll try to integrate this new information into the plot of this fic as 
well, so I guess that means the last chapter isn&#39;t the halfway mark of 
this fic. Well then, in this chapter we get an idea of what the &quot;Mother 
of Destiny,&quot; along with a big revelation for Shion that Jin was trying 
to hide from her for a long time (obviously this revelation has most 
likely strayed away from the original Xenosaga storyline, but whatever). 
We get some more insight into Ziggy&#39;s past later on, along with the 
appearance of the Scientia Organization (read the script translation for 
Xenosaga: Pied Piper for info on this, in fact, it&#39;s probably best you 
do so before reading this chapter). Also, Miang gets some more action 
sequences, but this time she won&#39;t be fighting her sister. With that 
said, let&#39;s get back to the story.

Roots and Revelations

(Allen&#39;s POV)

I can&#39;t believe what I just did... The Chief and everyone else, I... All 
of them were in danger and I just ran. Why, why did I do that? Is it 
because I knew I couldn&#39;t do anything to help them, or...? No, that&#39;s 
not true, I could&#39;ve done something, I could&#39;ve tried to do something, 
but I.. I just ran, my only concern being my own life. I&#39;m a sad excuse 
for a man.

&quot;Something wrong, Ridgeley?&quot; the military realian I escaped with asked.

&quot;Of course something&#39;s wrong!&quot; I yell. &quot;We just left our friends back 
there without even attempting to give them a hand. We shouldn&#39;t have 
done that, we should have...!&quot;

&quot;And just what is it we could have done?&quot; Canaan asks, calmly. &quot;You saw 
it yourself, the stairways were already beginning to crack the moment 
the structure began to shake, there&#39;s nothing we could&#39;ve done.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true!&quot; I retort. &quot;If we had warned them ahead of time, then 
maybe...! Dammit!&quot; my fist bangs against the closest wall. &quot;I know I 
could&#39;ve done something, at least a warning. I could have tried to help 
them hurry down further, but... Dammit... Dammit... Dammit!&quot;

&quot;Calm down!&quot; the realian orders as he takes hold of my collar. &quot;In times 
of war, you can&#39;t have a firm grasp on the situation, you can&#39;t control 
everything that happens.&quot;

&quot;But this isn&#39;t a time of war, this...&quot;

&quot;It very well could become one. Listen to me, Ridgeley! No matter how 
you look at things, there&#39;s nothing either of us could&#39;ve done without 
losing our lives in the process. You can keep wishing you could have 
done something, but that&#39;s not going to help no matter how you look at 
it.&quot;

&quot;But I...!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll get your chance,&quot; the realian releases me now. &quot;Don&#39;t always 
think that one failure means the end. If you really want to help that 
badly, you&#39;ll have the opportunity to do so at one point. It might not 
have been back there, but that doesn&#39;t mean that time is long off.&quot;

&quot;...yeah, I guess you&#39;re right, Canaan,&quot; I begin to calm down now. &quot;I 
shouldn&#39;t just mope around because of things I couldn&#39;t control, I have 
to...&quot;

&quot;Whatever, let&#39;s continue on.&quot;

The others have to be okay, there&#39;s no way that they&#39;d die so easily 
after everything that&#39;s happened so far. Even chaos said it himself, one 
day I&#39;ll be able to comfort the Chief and wipe away her tears. That day, 
it may be sooner than I think. Hang on, Chief, I might not be able to do 
much, but I&#39;ll do my best to help you and the others!

----------

(Elly&#39;s POV)

The cries that once filled the room have come to a stop; the masses that 
once tried to bring us harm have now settled, creeping as best as they 
can into the corners of the room. I see the fear in their eyes, looking 
past the deformities of their bodies and their rotting skin, looking 
into the very depths of their souls. I close my eyes in an attempt to 
block out the emotions I see within them, but I can still hear their 
sadness and fright from my ears. The actions my comrades and I have just 
committed, they may have been a good cause for stopping the Soylent 
System, but the victims of the system are still human. Yes their forms 
no longer resemble that of men, yes they needed the blood of humans to 
relieve the rotting of their flesh, but their feelings and hearts are 
still that of men.

I look at the giant Wels that my comrades and I had just defeated, 
gazing deep into his eyes. His entire being is stricken with even more 
pain; not only is the rotting of his skin growing worse, but now he is 
feeling the effects of the wounds we had inflicted upon him. Seeing him 
like this makes my body tremble, shaking not from fear, but from the 
emotions that tear from my eyes.

&quot;Citan...,&quot; I turn to my spectacled comrade, &quot;please lend me your 
sword.&quot;

Without saying a single word or showing any objection, the man hands me 
his katana. I take the weapon with my left hand, turning back to the 
fallen in front of me. His body begins to wince once again when he 
notices the weapon in my hands, his body trying to struggle. It saddens 
me further to see him like this, the only thing I can do is bring him 
relief.

I take my right hand at this point and bring it to the blade of the 
katana, my fingers closing down on the dull edge and my palm onto the 
sharp. I tighten my grip on the sharpened steel, the grasp causing me to 
wince. Droplets of ruby escape the palm of my hand now, my hand opening 
so that the drops may fall more freely. The spots of blood fall onto the 
mouth of the victim before me, his mouth barely opening so that he may 
catch every drop of the crimson elixir. His lips barely stretch after 
consuming the substance, his eyes no longer showing fear, but relief. 
Even though he is now relieved, his body ceases to move any more, his 
visage and body forever frozen in this form.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...,&quot; I apologize, trying my best to hold back my tears. &quot;I 
guess... I couldn&#39;t help you after all. All I can do for you now is 
cleanse your wounds. I&#39;m so sorry...,&quot; I cry, no longer able to keep the 
keep the rivers at bay.

&quot;Elly...,&quot; my long-haired comrade barely calls.

I turn to the remaining individuals who huddle into the corners, their 
bodies still aching from the agony of their flesh. Some have fallen to 
the floor succumbing to the pain, others scratch at the peeling skin in 
an effort to rid themselves of the distress, and then there are those 
who simply scream due to its effect. The tears in my eyes begin to dry 
at this point, the sadness in me quickly replaced by determination, the 
determination to try and relieve this people of this pain. I quickly 
wipe away my tears, regaining my composure as best as I can and step 
onto a bench situated close by. Though I cannot fix their ailments as I 
have with the one who just died, the most I can do is give them support.

&quot;Please! Listen to me!&quot; I cry, trying to gather their attention. &quot;Stop 
fighting among yourselves. We are all humans! This facility was built by 
the Solaris Ministry...,&quot; I inform them. &quot;It was created to implement 
their &#39;no waste&#39; plan. Such facilities were to convert mutated humans 
into weapons that were used as tools for their ambitions. Just one part 
of their overall plan of racial purification. Of course, once you enter 
their umbrella of protection... ...you can avoid absolute death. But is 
that human life!&quot; I raise my voice. &quot;Even if you are the only one left, 
if you&#39;re devoid of a heart, what does it all mean? All of you, want to 
be loved... needed by someone, so we look to others... By ourselves, we 
are lonely, so we try to draw together to live... That&#39;s what it means 
to be human... That&#39;s how people live. A single hand cannot clap. To 
relieve your pain, I&#39;ll give however much of my flesh you need. 
Therefore... don&#39;t throw away your dignity as humans... Don&#39;t let go of 
your human heart...&quot;

I find my body beginning to grow weak now, my legs slowly losing feeling 
and the rest of my body soon following after. My body does not meet with 
the ground however, as I find it being caught in the arms of another. My 
pony-tailed comrade pulls me toward him, his eyes showing a deep concern 
as he holds me. He holds me tight, his arms lightly shaking in an 
attempt to keep me conscience, but even his actions can do little for my 
fainting.

&quot;Elly...!&quot; he cries. &quot;Are you okay? What are you doing?&quot;

&quot;You think I am doing something foolish?&quot; I ask.

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;I only did what I could,&quot; I tell him. &quot;Maybe I&#39;m a hypocrite. A well to 
do &#39;have.&#39; Maybe it&#39;s only pity for the &#39;have-nots...&#39; But if I can know 
the joy of giving out a little of the life within me... Then maybe 
someday it may just be possible that one human can truly give love to 
another... People can do it... I truly believe they can. That&#39;s why...&quot;

&quot;Elly, wake up,&quot; another voice begins to call to me, frantically. &quot;Wake 
up, Elly! Wake up!&quot;

I begin to open my eyes now, my vision being greeted by a pair of 
emerald pupils. I begin to push my upper body off the ground, only to 
find it falling back again, forced backward as the arms of another wraps 
around me, their body pressing against mine in the process.

&quot;Elly, thank god!&quot; my lover cries as she hugs me.

Another dream... No, it felt too real to be a dream, it was just like 
the other ones I&#39;ve been having recently. That man who resembled Abel, 
Fei, was in it once again, but there was also another. Citan, that man 
who owned the sword, he looked very familiar, but who... Jin? No, it 
couldn&#39;t be... What was Jin doing in my dream? Never mind that, I 
thought Shion and I were supposed to be dead, so why...?

&quot;Shion, what happened?&quot; I ask. &quot;I thought we were falling after that 
sudden earthquake and then...&quot;

&quot;None of us here are sure what happened,&quot; I look past my lover to find 
her brother standing close by. &quot;When I came to, I found us here, with no 
injuries whatsoever.&quot;

&quot;And just where are we exactly?&quot; I question, the area looking alien to 
me. &quot;This place isn&#39;t anything like the area we were in previously.&quot;

The entire vicinity is a rich pink color, almost the color of red. The 
color is everywhere, but in some areas it is more translucent than 
others. Some parts looks as if they are pulsing, others appear to be 
rivers flowing along an invisible surface. Even the ground beneath us 
has a similar impression, it looks like we should be falling through the 
surface, but the question is, what surface is there?

&quot;My only guess is that we&#39;re somewhere deep inside U-DO,&quot; Jin answers.

&quot;How&#39;s that possible?&quot; Shion asks as she releases her grasp of me.

&quot;chaos said that Labyrinthos has become a part of U-DO if you recall,&quot; 
Jin explains, &quot;and do you remember what it was like when we ventured 
further into the structure? It became more and more like the anatomy of 
a biological creature.&quot;

&quot;So then, we must be deep inside it,&quot; I conclude.

&quot;We must find the others quickly,&quot; Jin orders. &quot;If we survived, then 
they must have as well. I don&#39;t want to think about what may happen to 
them or us if we linger here too long.&quot;

&quot;Right, let&#39;s get going,&quot; Shion nods.

The two siblings begin to run forward now and I begin to follow. After 
taking only three steps however, the two suddenly stop, their bodies 
frozen in place. I stop the moment I pass them, turning back to find 
them in the exact same position and pose they were last in. I begin to 
notice that the entire scenery around me as become frozen as well, the 
pulsing of the environment and its flowing rivers have come to a stop.

&quot;What the, what&#39;s going on?&quot; I ponder.

Before I can be given a moment to contemplate, a small ringing noise 
begins to emit in my ear. The sound catches my attention, causing me to 
freeze for a moment. It rings again a second later, but this time I see 
a flash of an object in my eyes. Another ring, the same image flashing 
in my eyes once again, this time I see it for a second more. A third 
ring, and then a fourth, each one revealing the same device for a more 
prolonged period of time with each instance. Finally the object becomes 
clear in my eyes; it&#39;s a giant gold-colored artifact, almost in the 
shape of a cross with a gem in the vertex.

&quot;The Zohar!&quot; I quickly recognize the device.

The gem begins to shift suddenly, the luster suddenly peeling away, 
revealing the shape of an oval with two ellipses inside it. The new 
shape looks like some sort of eye as I stare into it, but... Wait, did 
it just move? Did the &#39;eye&#39; just blink and then turn toward me?

&quot;The &#39;Arbiter&#39; has arrived,&quot; a mighty voice begins to boom inside my 
ears now.

&quot;&#39;Arbiter?&#39;&quot; the title leaves me confused.

&quot;...no, this isn&#39;t the &#39;Arbiter,&#39;&quot; the voice continues, &quot;this is only 
half of it.&quot;

&quot;Are you referring to Miang and me?&quot; I ask.

&quot;Oh &#39;Arbiter of the Future,&#39; of what path do you seek?&quot; the voice begins 
to question. &quot;Is the path you wish to partake the one your eyes intend? 
Or is the path you seek one in which you sever the Strings of Fate? 
Whatever your choice may be &#39;Arbiter of the Future,&#39; may you choose your 
destiny wisely, for it can never be undone.&quot;

&quot;Elly, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; my lover&#39;s voice echoes in my ears again.

&quot;Huh?&quot; I look back to find Shion and Jin standing in front of me, a look 
of concern on both of their faces. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I must&#39;ve spaced out for 
a second,&quot; I lie.

&quot;Time is of the essence, you mustn&#39;t do that again,&quot; Jin lectures.

&quot;Right.&quot;

&#39;That voice just now...,&#39; I think to myself as the three of us run, 
&#39;I&#39;ve never heard it before, and yet, it felt so... familiar... &#39;Arbiter 
of the Future,&#39; why does that title seem familiar as well? The Zohar, 
what exactly is it and what is it&#39;s link to me? No, what&#39;s more 
important is its link to Shion. I can&#39;t allow her to get in contact with 
it, I can&#39;t allow her to learn the truth!&#39;

&quot;Shion...,&quot; I stop once again.

&quot;What is it?&quot; she asks, her running coming to a halt once again.

&quot;...no matter what happens, you&#39;ll always be yourself...,&quot; I tell her. 
&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter who you are, but I, no, not just I, everyone will 
always be by your side. Isn&#39;t that right, Jin?&quot;

Her brother&#39;s tracks slowly come to a stop after my question. His back 
faces me for several moments, his head turned to the side and his eyes 
drifting to the floor. A worried look appears on Shion&#39;s face as she 
watches her brother ponder, that expression worsening on my own face as 
I see hers. Finally he turns around, his eyes shut and his lips closed 
inward.

&quot;...that&#39;s right,&quot; he finally speaks. &quot;You are you, Shion, nothing can 
ever change that.&quot;

&quot;Elly, Jin, what are you two talking about?&quot; my lover asks, confused. 
&quot;Did something happen?&quot;

&quot;...you needn&#39;t worry,&quot; I try to assure her. &quot;As long as I&#39;m here, you 
needn&#39;t worry...&quot;

I&#39;m sorry, Shion, but there are still some things that I can&#39;t tell you, 
and I&#39;m sure Jin would agree with me on this subject. Please Shion, no 
matter what happens, stay you, stay the way you are...

----------

(MOMO&#39;s POV)

My body feels so light, as if it&#39;s floating. I can hear the sound of 
waves flowing beside me, but my lungs still breath the air. I&#39;m...alive, 
but how, I do not know. I open my eyes to find a magenta-colored 
atmosphere around me, the scenery beating like a heartbeat. I try to 
move my body, but I can find no surface to step on. I find my entire 
self rotating instead, finding the same atmosphere and color everywhere 
I turn. Wait, I see something else in front of me, another person that I 
quickly recognize.

&quot;Jr.!&quot; I call out to him.

&quot;MOMO!&quot; he turns to me.

His arms and legs begin to paddle into the atmosphere, stroking outward 
as if he were swimming. In seconds he swims next to me, the two of us 
floating side-by-side. He breaths a sigh of relief afterwards, his arms 
quickly wrapping around me. I return the embrace and hold him close; a 
small fear has been lifted off my shoulders.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; he asks.

&quot;I&#39;m okay, but where&#39;s Ziggy?&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t know,&quot; he answers, regretfully. &quot;When I woke up, he was 
gone. He said that he would do everything he could to make sure we were 
okay, but... Damn it, this isn&#39;t fair! After how I treated him and 
everything, he still...! Why did he do that? He should have just...!&quot;

&quot;Jr., stop it!&quot; I demand, doing my best to hold my tears back. &quot;Ziggy 
didn&#39;t care how you treated him, he knew that even though you two didn&#39;t 
get along, you&#39;d still protect me if he was no longer there. Ziggy would 
always put the need of others ahead of his own, didn&#39;t you ever notice 
that over this past month?&quot;

&quot;I realize that now, but he didn&#39;t have to sacrifice himself to save 
us,&quot; Jr. explains. &quot;I mean, I&#39;m sure we all could have survived somehow 
if...&quot;

&quot;The others survived, I just know it,&quot; I interrupt. &quot;Ziggy, Shion, Elly, 
Jin, and chaos, all of them are okay, I just know it. It&#39;s not like you 
to give up hope that easily, Jr., so please, have as much faith in them 
as I do right now.&quot;

&quot;Faith is just a false hope...,&quot; another voice begins to echo in the 
atmosphere. &quot;It sets up expectations that allow us to keep going, but 
when those expectations are not met, we quickly fall. It&#39;s pathetic, 
don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Citrine!&quot; Jr. quickly recognizes the voice.

Our bodies begin to plummet downward after, the air quickly slicing 
against as I we fall downward. Everything in the vicinity begins to 
blue, the sound of wind screeching taking precedence over our own 
screams. Finally our bodies stop falling, our feet firmly placed on the 
ground and the scenery around us changing. No longer are we floating in 
an endless floating atmosphere, but we now stand in some sort of 
computer room.

The entire room is absent of life with the exception of Jr. and me. The 
sound of computers clicking and beeping has taken the place of the 
screeching wind, but it is not enough to drown out the sounds of our own 
breathing and footsteps. The cold feeling of the metal floor can be felt 
through the material of my boots, the feeling also shown through the 
mist that escapes my breath. Wait a minute, the layout of this room, it 
looks almost like the control rooms found in Proto Merkabah, but I know 
for a fact that we&#39;re looking at something completely different.

Actually, now that I think about it, I know this place, I know exactly 
where we are. I&#39;ve never personally been here myself, but this entire 
room has been outlined in my data banks. Daddy had left me some of the 
information about this place, along with several codes to... Wait, is 
that why Mommy really had me go here with Jr. and the others? She 
couldn&#39;t have just sent me to help everyone, she wanted me to...

&quot;Where are we now?&quot; Jr. asks.

&quot;You don&#39;t recognize this place, Rubedo?&quot; Citrine&#39;s voice echoes again. 
&quot;Well I&#39;m not surprised that you don&#39;t, we never came this far during 
our mission fourteen years ago. This is the main computer terminal in 
Labyrinthos, located on the seventh basement floor, not even U-TIC 
officers with the highest security clearance have access to the contents 
in the computers here. But, there is one among you who can access them.&quot;

Wait, how did she know about that? The only people who ever knew about 
my hidden data about this place were Mommy, Daddy, and the Contact 
Subcommittee, unless... It&#39;s just as Shelley said, the U-TIC 
Organization must have snuck into the highest levels of the Galaxy 
Federation&#39;s government and its organizations, that&#39;s probably how she 
knows.

A figure begins to appear in front of us now, but it is one that neither 
of us recognize. This individual that suddenly appeared out of thin air 
wears a long cloak and mask, covering their entire body. The cloak and 
mask are exactly the same as the ones as the Testaments we&#39;ve 
encountered so far, except that this one is a dull yellow. This new 
Testament begins to move their arm forward, but before anything else can 
happen, Jr. draws his pistols and immediately begins firing. Like the 
similar enemies we&#39;ve encountered before, the ammunition has no effect 
on them, the bullets falling to the floor as if they struck a wall.

&quot;Useless,&quot; the Testament speaks, their hand glowing a bright yellow 
shade after.

The bright light that emits suddenly brings Jr. to the floor, causing 
him to drop his guns and bring his hand around his neck. He begins to 
sweat profusely, the perspiration quickly turning into steam after 
escaping its pores. His expression of agony, it&#39;s exactly like that time 
when Citrine...

&quot;Stop it, what are you doing to him!&quot; I yell.

&quot;He&#39;s the one who started it,&quot; the Testament lowers their hand 
afterward. &quot;So how did that feel, Rubedo?&quot; the Testament asks, calling 
Jr. by his real name. &quot;Do you recall that sensation? The expression on 
your face, it was exactly like that. This look suits you well, Rubedo. 
My word, listen to me talk, I&#39;m sounding exactly like that weakling, 
Albedo.&quot;

&quot;Citrine...?&quot; Jr. and I begin to recognize the voice.

&quot;It took you that long to figure it out?&quot; she asks, removing the mask on 
her face. &quot;I really did give you and the girl more credit.&quot;

&quot;But how&#39;s that possible?&quot; the situation baffles me. &quot;When you were with 
us the whole time...&quot;

&quot;This is my true form,&quot; she answers. &quot;Rubedo, did you really think I 
survived that incident fourteen years ago? I&#39;m not Albedo, I don&#39;t have 
powers of regeneration, and a simple Medica Ether could not heal the 
wounds that were inflicted upon my body. You and the others left me 
there to die, you had denied me my chance to fulfill our purpose in 
life. I couldn&#39;t die without fulfilling our purpose, but as fate would 
have it, I had been offered a second chance. &#39;He&#39; recognized my &#39;Shining 
Will,&#39; saw my true potential. I was saved at the expense of throwing 
away my past life, and in exchange, I had to swear my allegiance to 
&#39;him,&#39; becoming what I am now.&quot;

&quot;And who is this &#39;he&#39; you&#39;re talking about!&quot; Jr. demands. &quot;Is it Yuriev, 
or someone else? Answer me!&quot;

&quot;And just why should I answer, Rubedo?&quot; Citrine asks. &quot;You&#39;re in no 
place to make the demands here. If I wanted to, I could just clump up 
all your red blood cells near your heart and simulate a heart attack, 
but &#39;he&#39; wouldn&#39;t want that. You, the realian, and the others still have 
roles to fulfill.&quot;

&quot;What the hell are you talking about!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you worry, you&#39;ll find out soon enough. Besides, be glad things 
are this way, at least you&#39;ll be guaranteed that nothing will happen to 
Kukai Foundation since I can&#39;t die. Now then, you, the 100-Series 
Prototype, you&#39;re the one with codes to access these computers, right? 
Well get to work!&quot;

Not wanting to cause any trouble, I do as she says. I walk over to the 
terminal in the center of the room and activate the control panel. The 
screen of ones and zeroes disappears with the press of a button, the 
background changing shape into a black screen with the U-TIC 
Organization&#39;s logo in the center. A smaller screen shows up in front of 
the logo now, asking for an ID and password. I do as the prompt says, 
typing in my serial number and the password Daddy left in my data banks, 
but instead of giving me access to the server, an error message shows 
up.

&quot;ID and/or password are invalid?&quot; I read from the screen.

&quot;I guess my information was wrong,&quot; Citrine shrugs, &quot;I suppose I don&#39;t 
have a use for you after all,&quot; her gun appears in her hand.

&quot;Hold it!&quot; Jr. readies his own firearms once again.

In an instant, the red-haired U.R.T.V. pulls the trigger of his guns 
several times, each pull resulting in a bullet escaping from one of his 
weapons. Citrine quickly notices this, turning her magnum away from me 
at this point and turning it toward Jr., tossing her cloak away in the 
process. She fires her gun several times as well, but the projectiles 
that escape aren&#39;t aimed for Jr., their aimed at the bullets he fired. 
The heads of each shot meet in seconds, each one falling to the floor 
upon impact. Jr. begins to move after the last bullets fall, firing his 
gun again as he strafes. Citrine copies his action, loading a new clip 
into her firearm before resuming her fire. Again each shot misses their 
intended target, striking against another bullet&#39;s head or impacting 
against a piece of electronic equipment.

The two start to come toward the end of the room, the two of them bound 
to meet at the curve. Closer and closer they come toward each other, 
each shot drawing closer and closer to their flesh. A clicking noise 
begins to emit from one of their guns now, the barrel of Citrine&#39;s 
magnum now pulled all the way back. Jr. quickly notices this, rushing in 
as fast as he can and leaping into the air. His foot leads his leap, but 
Citrine fails to act before it plants itself on her chest. His other 
foot follows, taking a step on her body and jumping off again, his body 
leaning backward so that he may perform a back flip. He points his guns 
at her once more, taking advantage of her moment of being stunned. His 
fingers begin to pull back on the triggers, but before a single bullet 
can escape, his entire body is suddenly forced backward, his body 
quickly meeting with the floor.

&quot;I never really enjoyed using my powers,&quot; she admits, her left palm 
pointed forward. &quot;But I can&#39;t let you interfere with my purpose again, 
Rubedo. Now then, 100-Series, where were we?&quot; she turns her attention to 
me once more.

&quot;Stop it!&quot; another voice yells in facility.

Each of us turns to the entrance of the room now finding the source of 
the voice. Tanned skin, silvery-white hair, and azure blue eyes are the 
most notable features of the one who stands there. chaos, I knew he&#39;d be 
okay, but there&#39;s something different about him. Normally he would look 
at each of us with a calm demeanor, but now everything is different. His 
tone of voice, it definitely isn&#39;t something he normally shows us. It 
was full of anger and his eyes are narrowed; it&#39;s just like when he 
attacked Albedo in the Kukai Foundation, only amplified. Did something 
happen when we left him to deal with those KOS-MOS units?

&quot;That&#39;s enough fighting!&quot; he orders. &quot;There&#39;s been enough bloodshed for 
today. I don&#39;t want anyone else to get hurt, friend or foe!&quot;

&quot;Huh, chaos, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jr. asks as he pushes himself back up.

&quot;Hmph, you got lucky that the boy arrived,&quot; Citrine says as she returns 
her weapon to its holster.

&quot;I never want to see anymore bloodshed, is that clear!&quot; he repeats 
himself.

&quot;chaos, calm down,&quot; I try to tell him. &quot;This isn&#39;t like you at all. Just 
what happened when we left you?&quot;

&quot;...it&#39;s nothing,&quot; his voice begins to lower. &quot;This place... I never 
thought that...&quot;

&quot;chaos, do you want to talk about it?&quot; Jr. asks, tugging the sleeve of 
his shirt.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing...,&quot; he calms down a little more, heading 
over to the computer panel I stand behind.

He begins to type on the machine now, typing in several letters and 
numbers for the login. In his first attempt, he manages to get past the 
login screen, allowing us to gain access to the server. He leaves the 
computer screen at this time, walking over to the nearest chair and 
placing himself upon it. A sigh escapes his lips after sitting, his 
hands burying themselves into his face afterward.

&quot;...chaos?&quot; I try to approach him.

&quot;...you have the codes to access everything else,&quot; he speaks. &quot;Go right 
ahead, just...leave me alone for a little bit.&quot;

&quot;...okay.&quot;

I do just as I&#39;m told, returning to the central computer and inputting 
more passwords and ID number logins that come up. As I search through 
the database, I find Jr. beginning to approach me. He too shares the 
worried look on my face, it&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s hurting just looking at 
chaos like this.

&quot;Is he going to be okay?&quot; I ask in barely a whisper.

&quot;...I hope so,&quot; Jr. whispers back. &quot;To tell you the truth, I&#39;ve never 
seen him like this, not ever. I&#39;ve always known him to be a really 
easy-going guy, as if he never had any problems of his own, but...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m worried too,&quot; I admit. &quot;He&#39;s acting pretty depressed. Do you think 
he&#39;s upset about what might have happened to the others?&quot;

&quot;It could be, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, it&#39;s not like him to get gloomy; in a situation like 
this, I know he would still think they&#39;re alive. If he knew for sure 
that one of us did cross-over, then...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true. You don&#39;t think...?&quot;

&quot;No, they are alive, I know it.&quot;

&quot;I know that, but there&#39;s something else I&#39;m wondering about. How he 
accessed the database without a sweat. This computer system, along with 
the other electronic equipment the U-TIC Organization uses is made from 
Hyams Industries,&quot; Jr. points out.

&quot;Hyams Industries, I&#39;ve heard about them, weren&#39;t they Vector&#39;s main 
business rival before the Miltian Conflict?&quot; I ask.

&quot;Yeah, they were even started up at the same time too. During the 
Miltian Conflict, both of them took sides; Vector sided with the Galaxy 
Federation and the Miltian Government while Hyams sided with U-TIC. I&#39;ve 
heard rumors that Hyams now makes stuff for anti-Federation forces, most 
of their products can be found in the black market. What I&#39;m curious 
about is how chaos was able to log into their database, only the 
highest-level executives could have access to sophisticated systems like 
this. You don&#39;t think...?&quot;

&quot;No, chaos isn&#39;t like that at all,&quot; I tell Jr.

&quot;...yeah, even though he&#39;s never said anything about his past, he&#39;s not 
the type to work for such a dark organization.&quot;

&quot;Did you two find anything yet?&quot; Citrine walks over to our terminal.

&quot;Why are you getting all buddy-buddy with us all of a sudden?&quot; Jr. 
sneers.

&quot;Stop it,&quot; I order the two before they can start fighting again. &quot;I just 
found something. You needed to access the database to find out where the 
Zohar is, right? Well I think I found it.&quot;

&quot;All right, where is it?&quot; Citrine asks.

I open the file for everyone to see now. chaos gets out of his chair now 
and walks over to the monitor at the point, the file opening to reveal 
another screen. The file is a document that lists several experiments 
with the Zohar, listing energy readings and UMN human transportation 
experiments. Nearly all of the experiments for transportation have made 
people disappear without a trace, while a tiny 1 who didn&#39;t disappear 
were left brain-dead. The energy listings have been listed as 
immeasurable each time after only a millisecond of starting up. I 
continue to search through the file and finally come to the end of the 
report.

&quot;The Zohar is far too dangerous for any of us to comprehend,&quot; it reads. 
&quot;Our technology is not advanced enough to control nor study it any 
further. We can now see why the team on Michtam abandoned their research 
twenty-four years ago. As a result of this danger, we must put the 
&#39;Omega Project&#39; on hold. The prototype unit will be left in custody of 
the Ormus Sect while the production model&#39;s creation will be halted. We 
shall seal the Zohar in the thirteenth floor of this facility. This will 
be beneficial for us as well, as U-DO will not only act as a type of 
barrier to the Zohar, but it will also allow it to grow in time for the 
&#39;Zohar Project.&#39; End of report.&quot;

&quot;The thirteenth floor, huh?&quot; Citrine repeats.

&quot;Wait, so the Zohar was here the whole time!&quot; Jr. exclaims. &quot;And the 
Zohar Project, how did the U-TIC guys know about it? And U-DO, did they 
purposely want it to grow for it?&quot;

&quot;Does that mean the Galaxy Federation and the U-TIC Organization are 
really working together?&quot; I wonder aloud. &quot;No, Mommy wouldn&#39;t...!&quot;

&quot;Things are much more complicated than they seem,&quot; chaos speaks. &quot;But 
MOMO, I doubt your mother would...&quot;

&quot;No, the only reason Mommy sent me here was to gain access to the 
computers so we can find out where the Zohar is!&quot; I cry. &quot;Why else did 
she keep me around for so long? She never cared about me, she would 
always... always look down on me. I always thought that if I kept trying 
to grow close to her, she would finally accept me as her daughter, 
but...!&quot;

&quot;MOMO, I...,&quot; Jr. tries to speak.

&quot;...Rubedo, stay with the girl...,&quot; Citrine orders. &quot;You, we&#39;re going to 
the thirteenth floor,&quot; she orders chaos.

&quot;Take care of her, Jr.,&quot; chaos tells him.

The two of them leave now, my tears becoming even more rapid now. I 
found myself beginning to choke on my own cries, with tiny gasps trying 
to break free from them. My nose is running as well, my eyes burning as 
if they were on fire. My legs begin to weaken, my palms barely catching 
my fall.

&quot;Why, Jr.?&quot; I choke. &quot;Why was Mommy always so distant from me? Why is 
that she could never bring herself to smile at me or give me words of 
praise? Why, Jr.? Why!&quot;

&quot;...MOMO, I&#39;m afraid that not all parents feel good about their 
children,&quot; he begins to speak. &quot;I know my father didn&#39;t. Yuriev..., he 
only saw me and the U.R.T.V.&#39;s as nothing more than pawns. He never saw 
us as part of his family. We were never praised, we were never smiled 
at, he would always... He was just so distant, he was like a stranger to 
all of us. Yuriev never wanted us to act like people, he said it showed 
weakness. All of us learned to accept this, well almost everyone. 
Albedo, he was the only one brave enough to stand up to Yuriev back 
then...,&quot; Jr. admits, his eyes beginning to water. &quot;He was the only one 
moral enough to know how we were being treated wasn&#39;t right. The rest of 
us were afraid to stand with him, and because of that... MOMO, even 
though your mother doesn&#39;t care about you, there are other people in 
your life that will; that&#39;s how it was for me. Don&#39;t you remember what 
Ziggy said? He said he loved you as if you were his own daughter, right? 
And the others, they all find you to be a good friend. And then I... I 
feel the same way MOMO, I care for you deeply...,&quot; he admits. &quot;I really 
do.&quot;

&quot;Jr...?&quot;

My body begins to move again, falling forward until my arms wrap around 
his frame. My tears begin to find themselves on the shoulder of his 
jacket, my fingers tightening around the material. His own arms wrap 
around my waist too, his breath pressing against my brow. More and more 
the tears fall, but with each tear, I find his body growing warmer. 
Warm, so warm his body is. I want to stay here like this, I just want to 
keep crying, I just don&#39;t want him to let go. I care for you deeply too, 
Jr. I care for you so much that you can&#39;t even imagine, so please, stay 
with me, even if no one else will be by my side...

----------

(Miang&#39;s POV)

It&#39;s been nearly three hours since the operation began, only half an 
hour since I arrived on the surface of Old Miltia. The mass-produced 
units have secured the perimeter of Labyrinthos, though four of them 
have been destroyed in the process. During their last transmission, I 
learned that they are currently working their way inward. The stairway 
to the basement floors has been destroyed, so they have used an 
alternate route by traversing the sewers that traverse around it. Chief 
Inquisitor Margulis has begun to move as well, he&#39;s taken several men 
with him into the interior; I heard they&#39;re planning on taking a 
high-clearance elevator from the first floor to the basement floors. 
Even the Patriarch has begun to move now, I&#39;m sure he&#39;s taken &#39;it&#39; with 
him for this mission. It&#39;s only a matter of time before Mother and her 
friends find the location of the Zohar, we just need the codes the 
100-Series has in her data banks to access U-TIC&#39;s highest security 
levels.

&quot;Unit 00-00-00-00-0, do you read me?&quot; I get a transmission.

&quot;Yes, I read you, Agent Pale Horse,&quot; I answer. &quot;What&#39;s your situation?&quot;

&quot;The 100-Series has located the whereabouts of the Zohar just moments 
ago,&quot; Citrine explains on the other line. &quot;Surprisingly, it was here the 
entire time, on the thirteenth floor of Labyrinthos. It appears U-TIC 
deliberately kept it here so U-DO could grow in time for the Zohar 
Project.&quot;

&quot;I see, I&#39;m guessing that the researchers didn&#39;t have enough time to 
transport it fourteen years ago,&quot; I tell her. &quot;We should have expected 
that it was still going to be there. In any case, continue as planned.&quot;

&quot;...there&#39;s been a small error in our plan though,&quot; she informs me after 
a moment of hesitation.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;The entire party has been separated, at the moment the only one with me 
is the boy known as &#39;chaos.&#39;&quot;

&quot;As I said, continue as I planned,&quot; I repeat. &quot;Chief Inquisitor Margulis 
is already within the interior and his Holiness is making his way here. 
As you&#39;ve heard, reinforcements shall arrive shortly, so continue with 
the objective, over and out.&quot;

I end the transmission at this point. It shouldn&#39;t be long before we 
obtain the Zohar, but it&#39;s certainly strange that it was in Labyrinthos 
this entire time. I suppose it makes sense, U-DO escaped the Zohar on 
that fateful day fourteen years ago, taking over the bottom half of the 
basement floors of the building in a manner of hours. If I recall 
correctly, the U.R.T.V. forces were sent in later that day, and they 
obviously failed in their mission. Now that I know the location of the 
Zohar, I must inform his Holiness.

I begin to ready another transmission, but before I could do so, my 
sensors begin to read signs of life hiding from behind me. One, two, 
...I count a total of fifteen individuals within the immediate vicinity. 
I pick up faint traces of plasma coming from each of them as well, they 
seemed to be armed with beam-type weapons. This is unexpected, I thought 
that we were the only ones here.

&quot;...I know you&#39;re hiding there,&quot; I sigh. &quot;Are you going to sit there all 
day or are you going to attack me?&quot;

I turn around to find each of the individuals coming out from the rubble 
that&#39;s scattered throughout the area. As I had expected, each of them is 
armed with a beam-type weapon of some sort; three are equipped with beam 
rifles, two with beam swords, and the rest with beam pistols. All of 
these people wear gaudy clothing, none of them wearing a distinct 
pattern of uniform. They&#39;re all wearing baggy street clothes for the 
most part, are they some sort of rebel force that&#39;s been occupying Old 
Miltia all this time?

&quot;So you must be the KOS-MOS unit we&#39;ve heard about,&quot; one of the women in 
the group begins to speak.

This woman seems to be the leader of the bunch; the rest of the members 
seem to clear a path for her so that she may approach me. Her clothes 
are just as gaudy as the rest of these men; she wears a ragged, black 
tank top, along with a faded, green long coat which drags down to her 
ankles, along with a tattered scarf that wraps around the collar of her 
jacket. She wears a pair of leather gloves, but the glove on her right 
has the index and pinky fingers torn off. She wears baggy pants that 
have the same faded color and shade as her jacket, it&#39;s obvious that she 
hides a beam pistol in the back of the clothing. Her face is covered in 
soot, but I can still make out the color of her grayish-green eyes. Her 
mahogany hair however, is clean for the most part, the strands cut at 
her shoulders. Now that I think about it, this woman&#39;s face is outlined 
in my data banks, it&#39;s...

&quot;My name is Meris Orthas,&quot; the woman speaks, &quot;perhaps you&#39;ve heard of me 
and my organization?&quot;

&quot;To be more specific, you are Meris Orthas the Second,&quot; I read from my 
data base. &quot;Your great-grandmother, Meris Orthas the First was the 
founder of your organization, Scientia. Scientia is notorious of being 
the largest Anti-Federation organization in the universe. Your 
organization is responsible for pirating many Federation government 
ships and government officials. You&#39;re classified as the most dangerous 
terrorist organization in the Galaxy Federation.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re quite informed, KOS-MOS,&quot; the woman smirks.

&quot;What is it you want from me?&quot; I ask.

&quot;The Zohar Project, what is it?&quot; she tries to interrogate me. &quot;We of 
Scientia would like to know what the Zohar is exactly and its effect on 
people. My great-grandmother witnessed what it was capable of firsthand, 
but she never knew what it was exactly. Tell me, KOS-MOS, tell me what 
you and the Galaxy Federation want with it and what it&#39;s capable of.&quot;

&quot;And if I should refuse?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re in no condition to,&quot; Meris snaps her fingers, each of her men 
pointing their beam weapons at me afterwards. &quot;Our spies in Vector have 
informed us of your creation, along with your battle capabilities. Beam 
weapons are most effective against machines because it causes them to 
short circuit, and you&#39;re no exception to this rule.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve certainly done your homework, but there&#39;s much more to me than 
what was outlined in Vector&#39;s data bases,&quot; I inform her.

My right hand begins to rise now, my fingers unfurling from a fist and 
the back of my hand facing my enemies. A rush of warmth begins to burn 
within my arm now, the sensation transforming into a sphere-like purple 
orb in the palm of my hand. The orb grows quickly with time, my foes 
quickly notice this. Their fingers begin to pull on the triggers of 
their weapons now, but before anything can escape their guns, the 
erratic energy in my hand escapes. The fire that escapes from their 
weapons is unleashed now, but each shot is absorbed into the stream of 
aura that escaped from my palm. Each of them rolls to the side to evade 
the attack, giving me time to prepare my own attack.

I run to the enemy closest to me as he recovers from his roll. By the 
time his eyes meet with my own, my own fist has already launched 
forward. My knuckles meet with his abdomen in an instant, the back of my 
left hand striking the side of his face soon after. Two others begin 
firing at me after I attack their comrade, but I evade each blast by 
taking the man before me and pulling him into the line of fire. Each 
attack meets with either an arm or a leg, I make sure that none of them 
strike his back or head. I toss the man away the second they hold their 
fire, my hands collecting more forms of Ether into their palms.

&quot;I have no intention of killing any of you,&quot; I inform them. &quot;However, 
that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t beat each and every one of you into the 
ground!&quot;

Another barrage of fire is opened after my words, but this time I make 
no attempt to evade. I move my arms forward at this point, the energy 
within my palms forced forward and expanding in seconds. The barrier of 
Ether absorbs the attacks once again, returning to my palms afterward 
only to shoot out once again causing each of them to scatter again. I 
draw the pair of tonfa on my belt at this moment, my arms quickly 
spinning them afterward to block several more shots. The incoming fire 
stops shortly after, halted by either the attacks returning to their 
instigators or by the need to reload.

The ones armed with beam swords rush in at this moment, one flanking me 
from the right and the other to the left. Both try to swing their blades 
downward at the same time, but my arms quickly push out to the sides so 
that my weapons may block theirs. My left leg pushes to the side after, 
meeting with the chest of the one on my left, the tonfa on my right 
striking inward after, knocking my attacker in the side of the head. His 
ally with the same weapon tries for another slash with my back now 
turned to him, but my elbow pushes back in time so that my other weapon 
can block it once again. My body turns once again, my right arm swinging 
with it so that my tonfa can strike my enemy to the floor.

I turn back to the rest of the opposition only to find one of my weapons 
being shot out of my hand. Another shot catches its twin, knocking it in 
the same direction. I look to the source of the shots to find the leader 
of these men now charging at me with her gun aimed forward. Two more 
trigger squeezes follow, but I move to the side to dodge each one. Her 
remaining conscious comrades begin to shoot as well, forcing me to 
remain on the defense. The blasts continue to fire at a rapid rate, my 
legs constantly trudging back and forth to evade each shot. This 
constant pace of moving back and forth is making it impossible for me to 
charge my Ether, there&#39;s no way I can keep dodging these attacks 
forever. I haven&#39;t been conditioned to use tertiary weapons like the 
mass-produced units yet, but there is that one weapon. It still hasn&#39;t 
been tested yet, but...

The barrage has become too rapid now, there&#39;s no way I can dodge the 
next shots. I begin to move my arm now, quickly swinging it inward from 
the side. A beam of light begins to form where my arm had swung, the 
beam solidifying soon after into the shape of a blade. I quickly take 
the hilt of the sword at this point and begin swinging again, striking 
at the incoming fire. The weapon in my hand begins to clash with the 
individual shots, the flat side of the blade deflecting each blast away. 
After parrying several hails of fire, I begin to move forward, charging 
toward the opposition, continuing to deflect each of their attacks.

Two of the Scientia soldiers try to block my path, but I easily cut 
through their weapons with my sword, slashing at their arms in the 
process with an under-handed strike, forcing them to drop their weapons. 
More try to shield my path again, mimicking the actions of their 
predecessors. It is of no use however, as the result is the same as 
before. The only one that remains now is the leader who fires her pistol 
at the same time she draws an beam knife. The firearm loses all of its 
ammunition in seconds, its owner quickly tossing it aside as she charges 
in with the energy blade. She screams as she runs toward me, the knife 
held close to her body as she charges. I bring my arm upward and prepare 
for a downward strike, only to bring the weapon down sooner as I find 
the knife suddenly hurled at me. I deflect the knife in the same way as 
the bullets, but I quickly realize that was only a decoy attack. A beam 
sword now appears in her hands, the blade already swinging forward from 
the side. I quickly notice this, jumping backward after to avoid the 
initial swing. She tries to go for a lunge soon after with my feet still 
not touching the floor, I can&#39;t avoid this one either. My blade swings 
outward as hers launches forward, the blades coming in contact for only 
a mere second; it is obvious that this battle is over.

She stands paralyzed now as the edge of my weapon barely touching her 
throat, the energy in her weapon no longer taking shape. She drops down 
to her knees after, her entire body still frozen from the shock of my 
sword absorbing the energy from hers. I keep my blade resting against 
her neck, all of her men that are still conscious can do nothing but 
watch as their lady kneels before me. This battle is over, I have no 
intention to continue it any further.

&quot;What was that...?&quot; are the only words that can escape Meris&#39;s lips.

&quot;The sharpness of this sword is determined by the user&#39;s Ether level,&quot; I 
explain. &quot;Not only that, it can also absorb the energy of beam-type 
weapons, the amount it can absorb is also reliant on the user&#39;s Ether 
level.&quot;

&quot;Even if that is true, the blueprints that were given to us by our spies 
said that your Ether level is only three times stronger than a human 
being&#39;s!&quot; she growls.

&quot;Correction, it was only three times stronger than a human being&#39;s,&quot; I 
explain. &quot;To put it simply, my Ether level is infinite; this Ether Edge 
weapon is capable of absorbing anything else your current equipment can 
strike me with as long as it&#39;s my hands. Don&#39;t even try and grasp the 
blade,&quot; I read past my enemy&#39;s next action. &quot;Just wrapping your fingers 
around it will have them cut off, faster than how a hot knife goes 
through butter. I have other matters to attend to now, so if you&#39;ll 
excuse me.&quot;

I jump into the atmosphere afterward, my feet landing on the rooftop of 
one of the still standing buildings. I leap to the roof close to it and 
the one after, trudging across the roofs so that I can make my escape. 
So that was Meris Orthas the Second, I can&#39;t say that I am impressed 
with her skills, even without my sensors I&#39;m sure I could have spotted 
her. Still, I have no intention of killing her or any of her men. She 
still has a role that she must fulfill after all. Regardless of that 
role or not, I truly did have no intention of killing any of them, I&#39;ve 
already gotten others involved who did not need to be not too long ago.

Elly, Mother, do you hate me for all I&#39;ve done so far? Elly, I&#39;m sure 
you must hate me by now by forcing you to be here. If I did not have my 
debt to &#39;them,&#39; I would leave you and all of your friends out of this. 
I&#39;m sorry, my darling, I&#39;m sorry, Mother, but... This is the way things 
must be, not only because of my debt, but for the sake of the universe 
as well...

----------

(Shion&#39;s POV)

It doesn&#39;t matter who you are, everyone will always be by your side. 
Just what did Elly mean when she said that. And Jin, he basically said 
the same thing. What is it that&#39;s worrying the two of them so much? 
Could it have had to do with that talk they had this morning in the 
dining area that made Elly storm out? &#39;The truth,&#39; what did Jin mean by 
that in the Kukai Foundation&#39;s meeting room earlier?

&quot;Miang?&quot; my lover suddenly stops in her tracks once again.

&quot;Elly, is something wrong?&quot; I ask her.

&quot;...I thought I just heard Miang&#39;s voice just now,&quot; she explains.

&quot;It looks like we&#39;ve reached the end,&quot; Jin informs us.

We look to his direction now and find a pair of large metallic doors in 
the distance. The doors look rather rustic, their perimeters almost 
absorbed into the magenta atmosphere. The three of us run to the giant 
doors at this point, the atmosphere pulling them apart as we draw 
closer. In seconds we find ourselves running through them only to end up 
in a room filled with darkness. Before any of us can even turn around to 
go back out, the doors shut on us, leaving us in the black room.

&quot;What is this?&quot; I ask the others.

&quot;Shion, Miss Elly, stay close,&quot; Jin orders.

Something begins to creep against my hand at this point, my body jumping 
as this sudden touch falls continues to glide against it. The creeping 
stops soon after, replaced by the feeling of something curling against 
my fingers. I realize now it is only Elly&#39;s hand holding my own, along 
with her head now resting on my shoulder. I breathe a sigh of relief 
upon realizing this, my fingers closing on her own. We each begin to 
walk forward now, our steps really slow and short. The only sound we 
hear in this room is the sound of our own breathing. The sound of metal 
barely enters my ear soon, but then I realize it&#39;s only Jin drawing his 
sword.

At this very moment, the color of white suddenly flashes over our eyes, 
along with a strong gust of wind that blows into our direction, nearly 
knocking us to the floor. My hold on Elly&#39;s hand quickly tightens, her 
other arm quickly wrapping around me in the process. The gust begins to 
die now and the flash begins to dim. The entire room is illuminated now 
and we now see the entire room. We find ourselves standing on a broad, 
metallic walkway, the other side of the railing showing us the floor 
below us. A forklift zooms after on the floor below us, the vehicle 
sitting the maximum occupancy of two people. I look further down to find 
several cranes moving as well, along with an observation area that&#39;s 
sealed in glass. There are several individuals inside the area, but I 
can&#39;t make out any of their faces.

&quot;What is this place?&quot; Elly asks as she observes the area around her.

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; my brother suddenly speaks, &quot;this is... It can&#39;t be!&quot;

&quot;Jin...?&quot;

&quot;No, that&#39;s impossible, this can&#39;t...!&quot;

The sound of humming begins to echo in our ears; though it is faint, we 
quickly notice that it&#39;s coming from the same floor as us but at the end 
of the walkway. A man stands there, a pencil in one hand and a clipboard 
in the other. He begins to tap the writing utensil against the board, 
the tapping matching the rhythm of his tune. Who is this man exactly, 
and why...?

&quot;Hey Dad!&quot; another voice echoes from behind us.

We each turn around now only to find a shock. The one who called the 
man, it&#39;s none other than Jin! My brother, there&#39;s two of them, but why? 
No, this one&#39;s a lot younger, he looks about the age of thirteen or 
fourteen. Then the woman that walks beside him, she&#39;s obviously older 
than him, and... Wait, if this is Jin, then the man he called out to and 
the woman walking her are...

&quot;Hello, honey,&quot; the woman greets him.

&quot;Darling, Jin, what are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;You said we could visit you today, right, Dad?&quot; the younger version of 
my brother says. &quot;You said that it&#39;d be okay if we watched today&#39;s 
experiment, isn&#39;t that right, Mom?&quot;

&quot;Mom...,&quot; their appearances cause something to stir within me. &quot;Dad...?&quot;

&quot;Mom? Dad?&quot; the titles baffle my angel. &quot;Shion, Jin, what...?&quot;

&quot;No, this can&#39;t be...,&quot; my brother says in disbelief. &quot;I can&#39;t be seeing 
this, not again. Mother, get out of here while you still can!&quot; he cries 
to our parents. &quot;Father, you can&#39;t start the test, you just can&#39;t! 
Please Father...,&quot; he begins to sulk into the floor. &quot;Please, listen to 
me...&quot;

&quot;Jin, are you okay?&quot; Elly asks, placing her hand on his shoulder. 
&quot;Shion, what&#39;s wrong with...? Shion?&quot;

&quot;My parents...,&quot; I still find myself paralyzed by their appearance, &quot;why 
are they here, what...?&quot;

&quot;You came at just the right time,&quot; our father tells the younger version 
of my brother and our mother, &quot;the test is just about to begin.&quot;

&quot;Dad, what are you up to?&quot; I barely voice my question. &quot;Mom, why...? 
Jin... what&#39;s going on here? Jin? Jin!&quot;

&quot;No, don&#39;t start the test!&quot; my brother screams again. &quot;Mother! Father!&quot;

My brother gets off the floor instantaneously at this moment, running to 
our father. To all of our surprise, Jin&#39;s hand passes through his 
figure. The initial passing causes him to back away for a moment, but he 
tries again after only to get the same result. He attempts to reach him 
again and again, each failed endeavor resulting in a tear rolling down 
his face.

A whistle begins to blow now and the entire area begins to shake 
shortly. I look onto the floor below us to find the ground pulling 
apart, along with a gold colored object rising from the growing gap. The 
cross-like shape, the gem-like device, it&#39;s obvious what this object is, 
it&#39;s none other than the Zohar. But what&#39;s the Zohar doing here, and how 
does my father know about it? He never mentioned anything like this to 
me when I was growing up.

&quot;This is it, son,&quot; my father tells the younger image of Jin. &quot;This is 
the key to Mankind&#39;s future. This is the Zohar.&quot;

&quot;Father, please...!&quot;

&quot;Is everyone ready? Then start up the experiment.&quot;

The men in the observation area begin to work on the control panel as 
everyone else in the vicinity turns to the Zohar. A light begins to 
barely emit from the relic, at first it is only a small reflection of 
light, but that reflection grows brighter and brights. The gem-like 
device on the Zohar shines as well, its light glowing stronger than the 
rest. Elly and I can do nothing but stare in awe as it glows, but before 
we know it, that glow is soon replaced by a flashing red light that 
flashes in the entire area along with the sound of a horn.

&quot;What the, what&#39;s happening!&quot; my father suddenly panics.

&quot;Sir, something&#39;s wrong with the control panel,&quot; one of the men in the 
observation area reports. &quot;The power output is gradually increasing, 
there&#39;s no way I can stop it. We&#39;ve already tried cutting off the 
electronic link to the Zohar and shutting down the machine manually, 
but...&quot;

The entire vicinity begins to shake at this moment, the alarm now taking 
precedence over the sound of everyone&#39;s panicking voices. The people in 
the vicinity begin to run, each of them passing through our forms as if 
we were specters. Pipes and other pieces of the ceiling begin to fall 
now, some striking fleeing workers and other pieces of machinery. My 
parents and the younger version of Jin however, stand in shock as they 
continue to stare at the Zohar.

&quot;Why, what could have happened that could&#39;ve caused this!&quot; my father 
asks, slamming his palms onto the railing of the walkway.

&quot;Honey, we have to get out of here!&quot; my mother orders him.

&quot;Chief Uzuki, come on!&quot; a worker on a motorized cart drives up to my 
family.

&quot;Jin, you first,&quot; my father orders.

&quot;No, Father!&quot; Jin screams. &quot;Don&#39;t put me there. Mother, sit Mother 
there, please! Please, Father...!&quot;

&quot;All right...,&quot; the younger version of my brother says uneasily as he 
takes the last seat on the vehicle.

&quot;Come on, we&#39;ll ride on the back,&quot; my father tells our mother.

&quot;NO!&quot;

The cart begins to drive off now, quickly whisking all of them away. Jin 
immediately chases after the machine, running along side it for the 
first few seconds, only to quickly fall behind. Elly and I naturally try 
to follow, but neither of us are fast enough to catch up with my 
brother. The cart in front of us begins jump upward now, jumping after 
hitting a piece of debris. More and more debris begins to fall, some on 
my brother and self, but the debris passes through us much like the 
people earlier. I look above and find a pipe falling downward, but this 
lead device is not falling toward me, it&#39;s falling for the cart in front 
of us. The pipe has contact with the skull of one person on the machine, 
knocking them off the machine in the process. My eyes can&#39;t help but 
widen the moment I realize who it had struck, my brother screaming again 
after the moment of impact.

&quot;MOM!&quot; the younger version of my brother screams.

&quot;MOTHER!&quot; Jin screams as well.

He finally catches up to her, his body diving forward in an attempt to 
catch her, only to have her form pass through him like all the others. 
The very image causes something else to stir within me, my mind 
remembering that day fourteen years ago. The tearing of flash and bone, 
the screams for help, all of it, remembered again after seeing what 
happened to my mother. The very image paralyzes me once again, my palms 
forcing themselves into the ears in an attempt to block out the cries 
for help that were never answered that day, my eyes shutting so that I 
may shield myself away from those visions. It is no good however, for I 
still remember, that nightmare only growing worse with what I had just 
seen.

&quot;Stop the cart!&quot; my father orders the driver. &quot;Stop it!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Chief, but...!&quot;

&quot;Dammit, that&#39;s an order!&quot;

&quot;Chief, we can&#39;t afford to...!&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll...!&quot; my father tries to jump off the vehicle.

&quot;Chief, don&#39;t!&quot; several other workers hold him back.

&quot;MOM!&quot; my brother screams again.

Another flash of light emits in my eyes for a quick second, and when the 
flash is gone, we find ourselves in another place. We appear to be in 
some sort of hospital room, I can tell by the gray walls and the nearly 
sterile environment. I turn to the end of the room to find two 
individuals lined up against a bed with a person lying on it. I quickly 
recognize each of them, it&#39;s my family. The younger version of my 
brother is lying against the bed, his face pressed against the covers as 
sobs escape his lips. My father stands next to him, his face scrunched 
and tears barely escaping his eyes.

&quot;Now where are we?&quot; Elly asks the two of us.

&quot;...this is where our mother was first treated,&quot; Jin explains, wiping 
away the tears traveling down his face.

&quot;What, but I don&#39;t remember any of this,&quot; I tell him.

&quot;...this was about a year before you were born,&quot; my brother explains. 
&quot;Somehow..., Mother survived the Zohar going berserk, she was the first 
and only person to survive an accident such as that. However, her memory 
was never the same... What happened that day, that was the reason why 
she had random occurrences of amnesia. ...we&#39;ve seen enough,&quot; my brother 
quickly places his hand on my shoulder. &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here!&quot;

&quot;But Jin...!&quot;

&quot;Chief Uzuki, I presume?&quot; a man I had not expected to see suddenly 
enters through the door.

What&#39;s he doing here, and why does he look exactly the same way he did 
when...? The ghostly white hair, the bright red eyes, and the very pale 
skin, all of these feature show no difference from how he looks in the 
present. He even wears the same black suit, all of his mannerisms seem 
to be the same as well. Just what is Sir Wilhelm doing here?

&quot;Sir Wilhelm, what are you doing here?&quot; my father asks.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about what happened to your wife, and what happened during 
the Zohar experiment,&quot; Sir Wilhelm apologizes.

&quot;Sorry...?&quot; the younger version of my brother begins to peel away from 
our mother&#39;s bedside. &quot;Sorry! What do you mean &#39;you&#39;re sorry!&#39; It&#39;s 
because of those experiments that you&#39;re company&#39;s conducting that my 
mom ended up like this, you son of a bitch! I swear I&#39;ll...!&quot;

&quot;Jin, stop it!&quot; my father orders. &quot;Go wait outside.&quot;

&quot;But Dad...!&quot;

&quot;Go!&quot;

The younger version of Jin begins to walk out of the room, his hands 
forced into his pockets and his feet kicking with every step. He passes 
through us like the people in the last scene, slamming the door on his 
way out. The door barely opens again soon after, my brother&#39;s eye 
staring in from the other side.

&quot;Shion, we&#39;ve seen enough,&quot; the older version of Jin tells me, his hand 
quickly grabbing my wrist. &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot;

&quot;Stop it, Jin!&quot; I free myself from his grasp. &quot;Just why are you acting 
like this all of a sudden? Is it because of what you saw happened to 
Mom? I&#39;m just as upset as you are about all of this, maybe more so 
because Dad never explained any of this to me before he died! So just 
why...!&quot;

My brother quickly interrupts me before I can talk further, his arms 
suddenly wrapping around my body and his cheek rubbing against mine. I 
find my heart beginning to beat rapidly at this moment, my breath short, 
and my body paralyzed. This is the first time my brother has hugged me 
in such a long time, but why now? Why would he...?

&quot;No matter what happens, you&#39;ll always be my sister,&quot; he suddenly 
speaks. &quot;Do you understand me, Shion? You&#39;re my little sister, nothing 
more, nothing less.&quot;

&quot;Jin, why are you saying these things all of a sudden?&quot; I ask. &quot;Just 
what is...?&quot;

&quot;...cover your ears, Shion,&quot; my lover begs. &quot;Please, be deaf to the 
voices around you. Don&#39;t listen to a single word they say.&quot;

&quot;Elly, you too?&quot; I find myself even more puzzled. &quot;Elly, Jin, just what 
is wrong with both of...?&quot;

&quot;Your wife is a very special woman,&quot; Sir Wilhelm begins to speak above 
the rest of our voices.

&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; my father says, his finger tenderly running down her 
bedsheets. &quot;She&#39;s done so much for Jin and I.&quot;

&quot;Not just that, you know what she&#39;s capable of,&quot; Sir Wilhelm continues. 
&quot;There are barely anymore of her kind.&quot;

&quot;Anymore of her kind?&quot; I begin to push myself away from my brother now. 
&quot;What does he...?&quot;

&quot;Close your ears!&quot; Elly suddenly wraps her arms around me now. &quot;Don&#39;t 
listen to them, Shion. Pay them no mind, turn your attention elsewhere, 
please!&quot;

&quot;...I know,&quot; my father nods. &quot;There are barely any people left who are 
not descended from genetic engineering whatsoever, she is one of those 
very few. Her surviving the Zohar accident is enough evidence to warrant 
that. The doctors say her memory isn&#39;t going to be the same as it used 
to be, but...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid she is of no more use to us then,&quot; Sir Wilhelm speaks. &quot;Such 
a pity, I always thought she would be the &#39;Mother of Destiny.&#39; No, maybe 
not, she did give birth to your son after all.&quot;

&quot;...then what do you propose we do for the KOS-MOS Project?&quot; my father 
asks. &quot;The Zohar Project is reliant on the completion of that and the 
Omega Project.&quot;

&quot;Your wife still has use, Mr. Uzuki,&quot; Sir Wilhelm answers. &quot;Or rather, 
her DNA and womb still has some use.&quot;

&quot;Wait, you don&#39;t mean...!&quot;

&quot;We shall clone her.&quot;

I find my entire body growing even more frozen before, even my lungs 
stop taking in air. The atmosphere and all of its surroundings begin to 
swirl around me, spinning so quickly that until they disappear. 
Everything is gone, everything except the words Sir Wilhelm had just 
said. The words &quot;we shall clone her,&quot; each of them feel like a dagger 
piercing into my heart. They repeat in my ears as well, restarting the 
vocabulary stabbings once more.

&quot;Clone her? But sir...!&quot;

&quot;It is vital to our project, is it not?&quot; Sir Wilhelm asks.

&quot;...yes sir...&quot;

&quot;Besides, you always said you wanted another child, a daughter to be 
exact. Didn&#39;t you say that you and your wife already had a named picked 
out as well for her? &#39;Shion,&#39; wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

The sound of name sends another jolt surging throughout my body. My eyes 
are opened wider than ever before, and my entire body trembling. My 
entire body begins to grow limp, my knees weakening enough that I would 
fall to the floor if I was not held by the one in front of me. I feel 
dizzy once again, the air I breathe not doing anything to fulfill the 
need for oxygen in my lungs. The truth, I never knew it could hurt so 
much, and my name, never did I once think of it as some sort of label, 
but...

&quot;I... I&#39;m a clone...?&quot; the words barely escape my lips. &quot;My birth, it 
was just so that I could be used to... All this time, I...&quot;

&quot;Shion, stop it!&quot; my lover&#39;s grasp tightens. &quot;Don&#39;t say such a thing!&quot;

&quot;So I was just born to be used by him, isn&#39;t it? Even my own father knew 
about it, he was responsible for my creation. Him and Sir Wilhelm, 
they...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true, Shion!&quot; Jin cries. &quot;You weren&#39;t born to simply fulfill 
what they have planned, you were...!&quot;

&quot;...my father, he was never my real father... My mother..., she was the 
original me, the current me is only a copy... My brother..., he&#39;s not my 
real brother... My family, my friends, none of them can truly be mine, 
they&#39;re...&quot;

&quot;Please, don&#39;t say anymore, Shion!&quot; my lover interrupts, her own tears 
running down her face. &quot;You have me! I don&#39;t care what Wilhelm or anyone 
else says, the fact of the matter is you are you and I&#39;m here by your 
side no matter what! I love you for who you are, Shion Uzuki, not what 
you are. I didn&#39;t fall in love with your mother, I fell in love with 
you! So please, Shion, pay them no mind, because I...!&quot;

Everything begins to disappear from me at this moment. Elly&#39;s hold 
around me, the images of the hospital room, the voices of everyone 
around me, everything, gone. Everything is nothing but black now, 
everything that I thought was real was nothing more than a fabrication 
created by him. My life, what have I been doing with it all this time? 
Is my purpose only to be a replacement for the one I was cloned from? 
What was it Sir Wilhelm wanted me to do? What is it that I&#39;m supposed to 
do, what is my purpose? Everything, everything that I&#39;ve been doing was 
done according to him, wasn&#39;t it? I... I&#39;m a puppet, ever since I was 
born, I&#39;ve been dancing with the strings of Fate. My &quot;father&quot; and 
&quot;mother&quot;&#39;s deaths, Kevin dying, Miang being destroyed and resurrected, 
Elly&#39;s creation, all of it was orchestrated as a show for him. My life 
has just been a game in the possession of another, I am just another 
pawn. I am... nothing...

----------

(Ziggy&#39;s POV)

Darkness, nothing but the color of black. Is this what death is supposed 
to be? For nearly a century, this is what I&#39;ve been searching for, but 
after everything that has happened recently, I no longer want this. I 
try to move, but my body doesn&#39;t react. Move, I want to move, I want to 
open my eyes, I want to listen to world around me. This isn&#39;t what I 
want, I don&#39;t want to be here.

&quot;Dad...,&quot; I hear a voice faintly calling for me.

The dark hue before my eyes begins to grow lighter now, colors of other 
shades beginning to appear before my eyes along with figures and forms 
beginning to take shape. A table is in front of me, along with a lamp 
and other forms of furniture in the background. There is another figure 
that stands before me, but I can hardly make it out at first, but then 
it becomes clear.

&quot;Dad,&quot; the figure calls again.

&quot;What, Joaquin?&quot; I find my son standing before me. &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;You really are my dad now!&quot; he exclaims, cheerfully.

I find myself speechless after his last statement. Proud, is this how it 
feels to be part of a real family?

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I turn around to find my wife standing behind me.

&quot;...It&#39;s just that... I always thought of myself with little emotion, 
but... maybe I was allowing myself to be heartless,&quot; I explain.

&quot;That&#39;s not true,&quot; Sharon assures me, her arms delicately wrapping 
around my shoulders. &quot;Both you and my late husband were hurt because 
your hearts were too kind. Because there are too many bad things in this 
world.&quot;

The entire scenery begins to meld together once again, coalescing into 
darkness for a mere second, only to return to bring me into a different 
scene. I find myself standing in a place I had never wanted to set foot 
again, a place I had dreamt of everyday for the last century, a place I 
so desperately tried to forget.

&quot;...So this is the Zohar,&quot; I find my nemesis standing before the giant 
gold relic. &quot;It&#39;s beautiful... What an appropriate place to achieve my 
objective! Take heed, souls that are imprisoned in my mind! You should 
see this! Oh, don&#39;t be so solemn... we&#39;re about to become an existence 
you can&#39;t even imagine! ...My preparations are complete! Look, oh great 
Lord! Oh great U-DO! Grant me your power by the terms of our contract!&quot;

I frantically try to charge toward my enemy at this point, my body 
somehow being pressed back by an invisible barrier. My fist begins to 
strike against this unseen wall, attempting to reach to my wife and son 
on the other side. Neither of them react to my pleas however, the two of 
them kneeling before the relic locked in prayer.

&quot;Sharon!&quot; I scream. &quot;Can you hear me? Dammit! ...Sharon! Listen to me, 
Sharon!&quot;

&quot;&#39;And the bowl was poured on the great river, Euphrates,&#39;&quot; Voyager 
chants, &quot;&#39;and its water has dried up, so that way of the kings from the 
east might be prepared.&#39; ...Are you ready to accept the way of God?&quot; he 
asks my wife.

&quot;In exchange for our lives...is it true you&#39;ll bring peace to the people 
we love?&quot; she asks.

&quot;I guarantee it...&quot;

&quot;Sharon!&quot; I bring my fist against the impassable barrier once again. 
&quot;He&#39;s manipulating you! This is one of Voyager&#39;s mind hacks...!&quot;

&quot;Mom,&quot; Joaquin turns to his mother, &quot;now we can be with Dad forever, 
right...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, we really can...,&quot; she smiles, &quot;we&#39;ll never lose him again...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happy...,&quot; the boy returns the gesture. &quot;Mom, I&#39;m really happy...&quot;

&quot;Joaquin!&quot; I scream again. &quot;Save Sharon! Sharon! Do you want Joaquin to 
die! That dream, it&#39;s a lie! You can&#39;t be happy that way!&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go...,&quot; my nemesis tells them.

&quot;Now we&#39;ll never mourn again...&quot;

&quot;VOYAGER!&quot; I scream.

I find myself lying against a metallic surface now, my vision turned to 
an infinite darkness. The sound of computers tapping and clicking begins 
to echo in my ears, but there are no signs of human life. I try to get 
up now, but I find myself unable to move. I look to my body to find it 
strapped to the metallic surface. I try to force myself out of the 
restraints, but I find myself unable to do so.

&quot;Hello, Jan,&quot; the voice of my nemesis enters my ear.

&quot;Voyager!&quot;

The face of my nemesis begins to leer at me from an upside-down angle, 
his smirk as sinister as ever. Again I try to free myself from my 
restraints, using more effort than ever before to escape. A fit of 
laughter escapes his lips as he watches me struggle, his taunting only 
causing me to try harder.

&quot;Is this how you react to seeing an old friend?&quot; he provokes further. 
&quot;And just when we finally got the chance to talk one-on-one again. It&#39;s 
a little bit like old times, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;Shut up, you&#39;re no friend of mine!&quot; I spit.

&quot;Oh, and those people you&#39;ve been hanging around with are? I can&#39;t 
believe you replaced me so easily.&quot;

&quot;My hatred for you has yet to be replaced!&quot;

&quot;Still hung up on the past, I see,&quot; he sighs. &quot;What happened to that 
notion you told that U.R.T.V. not too long ago? You know, the one about 
thinking only about numbers and battle strategy.&quot;

&quot;Bastard!&quot; I curse. &quot;You&#39;ll pay for what you did to Sharon and Joaquin!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just so fun to taunt you, Jan, just like a little child. But it&#39;s 
not fun to keep provoking like this. No, not when there&#39;s another that 
can bring out the worst in you,&quot; that sinister smirk stretches.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare do anything to MOMO!&quot; I yell. &quot;I swear, Elrich, if you 
or any of your comrades even touch a hair on her head, I&#39;ll...!&quot;

&quot;Who said any of us will harm her when you&#39;ll be the one to do it 
instead.&quot;

&quot;What do you...!&quot;

Before I can say anything further, I find my entire body beginning to 
burn. The mechanical components in my body begin to clatter, my entire 
self jumping upward as far as the restraints can let me. I begin to 
scream from the shock that travels throughout my entire system, the 
systems specifications that are often seen in my eyes turning into 
static. Though I cannot see what is being done to me, I can still feel 
every part of my being burning from the electricity surging through me. 
More and more I feel myself being torched from the inside, my entire 
body becoming stiff and unmoving.

Images from the past begin to play though my eyes once again. I see my 
parents, their faces as clear as day for the first time I can remember. 
My father, he hands me his beret, placing it on my tiny head. Then I see 
Sharon and Joaquin, both of them smiling at me. I reach for them, the 
three of us walking hand-in-hand into the sunset. And then I see MOMO, 
her arms wrapped around me with a gentle smile on her face. My hand 
begins to run down her pink strands of hair, straightening the silk-like 
locks. I find myself smiling for a moment, but that smile soon melts 
away.

I see nothing, I hear nothing, I feel nothing. I... I am...

&quot;Awaken, Ziggurat 8,&quot; a voice orders me. &quot;Awaken and destroy.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; I find myself obligated to obey.

----------

XenoMark&#39;s Note: That was definitely tough to write. Is it hard to 
believe that Shion is a clone of her mother? I don&#39;t really think so, 
there&#39;s a few theories circulating around the internet about it. As for 
the &#39;Mother of Destiny,&#39; I&#39;m afraid it might be a bit longer before I 
truly reveal what that is since I don&#39;t want to give up all my answers 
right away. As for Citrine leaving MOMO and Jr. alone, I know it seems 
out of character for her, but there&#39;s still parts of her past I haven&#39;t 
explained and revealed yet. And chaos, we&#39;ll definitely learn more about 
him soon, as well as why he allowed Citrine to contact Miang. Anyways, 
review if you like, but please don&#39;t flame me. In the next chapter, the 
party finally comes across the Zohar, but will everyone be mentally 
prepared for it, especially when one of their own turns on them. Hope 
you all look forward to it, see ya!</pre>
