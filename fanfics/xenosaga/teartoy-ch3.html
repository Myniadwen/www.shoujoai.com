<h1>Tears of Toys (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/albedoright.html">Albedo's right hand</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/teartoy-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>	The soft blue glow filled the room with a haunting twilight. The 
glow radiated from the hard coffin of KOS-MOS. The soft blue light cast 
shadows across the android&#39;s body, giving her a regal look as she slept 
her dreamless sleep. 
	The door silently opened to reveal the short figure of Momo 
walking into the room. She stopped and watched the silent angel resting 
in her black coffin. She saw KOS-MOS in a new light, both literally and 
metaphorically.
	She saw every shadow draped over the android&#39;s body and felt at 
peace at the sight, but she couldn&#39;t help feeling nervous. Would she 
forgive her for how she treated her earlier? Such thoughts played 
through her head and even she was surprised that she had the courage to 
walk right up to the coffin.
	She stared softly at the face of the one that loved her. She saw 
those lips, those oh so tender and warm lips that kissed her. She 
couldn&#39;t help but bring her finger to her lips and traced the sensitive 
flesh that the android had so softly kissed.
	She blushed as she thought back to that moment and a renewed 
courage ran through her. She leaned over the edge of the coffin but she 
couldn&#39;t reach her destination. The bulky edges of the recharge unit 
combined with her own lack of height made it impossible.
	She put both hands on the edge and with a small grunt lifted 
herself so she was now sitting on the edge of the coffin. She was now 
unobstructed as she twisted her torso and leaned forward to plant a kiss 
on the androids lips.
	Once again those soft lips held warmth that shocked Momo. She 
couldn&#39;t stop herself and enjoyed every moment of that kiss as she 
tasted those soft lips. She had never had such a soft and caring kiss 
and wished that it would never end.
	Even she was shocked when she lifted her legs up and slipped into 
the coffin. Now her small frame lay on top of the android, the warmth of 
the mechanical angel calmed the realian of any nervousness she had left.
	She simply closed her eyes and let the warmth of the one that 
loved her wash over her body like the gentle waves of an artificial 
beach. She wasn&#39;t sure how long she wandered between the edge of sleep 
but a motion suddenly caused her to open her eyes.
	KOS-MOS had brought her arms around Momo&#39;s small frame and held 
her close. Momo looked up at the face of the android and was greeted by 
two crimson eyes looking back at her. 
	&quot;KOS-MOS...I want to apologize for how I acted, and that I...&quot; She 
trailed off just before kissing KOS-MOS. The android had a soft look on 
her face and a smile crept across her lips. Momo then whispered,
	&quot;Just promise me...You&#39;ll always be with me.&quot; KOS-MOS tightened 
her hold around Momo and replied tenderly,
	&quot;Even when my circuits fail I&#39;ll forever be by your side.&quot; Momo 
startled giggling and KOS-MOS looked at her quizzically,
	&quot;What? Did I say something funny?&quot; Momo kept giggling and stopped 
herself only by locking lips with the blue haired angel.
	&quot;It&#39;s nothing. Nothing at all.&quot; She said with a smile. KOS-MOS 
leaned forward for another kiss and Momo flung her arms around the 
androids neck.
	&quot;I love you Momo.&quot; Momo returned the kiss and softly replied,
	&quot;I love you to KOS-MOS.&quot; This kiss was longer then the others and 
seemed to last forever. When KOS-MOS broke the kiss she soon discovered 
that Momo had fallen asleep. She adjusted her position just enough to 
make the young realian&#39;s sleep more comfortable. She herself soon fell 
back to her dreamless sleep wishing that she would one day be able to 
dream of the person she loved.

	&quot;Momo...Momo wake up.&quot; The young realian slowly opened her eyes to 
the gentle rocking of the android that had fallen in love with her.
	&quot;Mmm...What&#39;s the matter?&quot; KOS-MOS brushed a pink strand of hair 
out of Momo&#39;s face.
	&quot;Shion is on her way here. I suggest you get off of me soon.&quot; Momo 
nestled back down onto her and said in a dreamy tone,
	&quot;Why bother she is going to find out soon eventually.&quot; KOS-MOS 
spoke with a sad tone in her voice,
	&quot;I just don&#39;t want her to start examining me. I know she will and 
she might think my feelings for you are just some glitch or something.&quot; 
Momo got to her knees and crawled out of the black coffin, she began to 
miss the warmth she had felt.
	&quot;I understand KOS-MOS.&quot; She straightened her hair and looked over 
her outfit to make sure she looked normal. &quot;Anyway. How did you know she 
was coming?&quot; KOS-MOS gave a rare smirk,
	&quot;I track her connection gear 24-7 so I know exactly were she is at 
all times.&quot; Momo put both hands and leaned over the edge of the coffin 
as KOS-MOS lay completely flat and closed her eyes.
	She was close enough to her to kiss her and wondered if she had 
enough time but the door suddenly opened and the voice of Shion could be 
heard,
	&quot;Like I told you earlier, I believe the 100-series could easily be 
upgraded for combat. You just need to approve the schematics and let 
Vector do...Oh Hey Momo.&quot; Both Shion and Jr. stepped into the room.
	Jr.&#39;s look didn&#39;t change much since he was already extremely 
annoyed at Shion&#39;s persistence about 100-series being combat worthy. 
Although he did look visibly surprised at the sight of Momo. He didn&#39;t 
say anything as he headed for the door but turned his head to look at 
Shion out of the corner of his eye,
	&quot;Shion if you request such an upgrade you need to talk to both 
heads of the Kukai Foundation. Send a full report of the schematics, 
stop pestering me!&quot; His voice dripped with the new acid he had 
discovered.
	&quot;Well...Oh well. Why are you up so early Momo?&quot; Shion asked with 
smile. Momo searched her memory for something. No. Anything to say to 
the Vector employee.
	&quot;I...um...Had a...bad dream...about KOS-MOS...you know very vivid! 
I came here then you two showed up.&quot; Shion smiled softly,
	&quot;That makes sense. I myself sometimes have bad dreams about 
KOS-MOS to.&quot; Momo mentally slapped Shion for being so trusting and bent 
over the coffin again to look at the face of her lover.
	&quot;She has a beautiful face.&quot; She said knowing exactly how Shion 
would reply.
	&quot;Why thank you. Kevin designed the frame but I designed the out 
epidermis layer as well as...&quot;
	&quot;Alright that&#39;s enough Shion.&quot; Momo interrupted knowing how long 
the scientist could talk about the android.

	&quot;Damn it Shion! Why does she keep pestering me about petty 
upgrades?&quot; Jr. yelled storming through the hallways of the Elsa towards 
the exit. Hammer walked through the door only to be pushed back in by 
the short U.R.T.V.
	&quot;Damn it! I don&#39;t want to send the 100-series into combat! We have 
A.M.S. and A.W.G.s and E.S. as well as ACTUAL combat realians!&quot; His 
voice dripped venom and his voice was heard only by Hammer who was still 
standing up.
	&quot;I won&#39;t send them out onto the battle field...even...even if he 
made them...and they look like her!&quot; He said under his breath and he 
stormed towards the elevator that would take him to his office. He 
reached the elevator and punched the panel with his fist.
	His red cloak rustling as he stepped into the small glass 
elevator. He crossed his arms trying to calm down. Just before the doors 
close a hand blocked its path and reopened for the new visitor.
	&quot;Leave me alone Gaignun!&quot; Jr. yelled with pure malice. The taller 
U.R.T.V. simply leaned against the glass wall on the opposite side of 
the elevator and said,
	&quot;So you hate him, but you won&#39;t let those reminders he left you go 
away. I believe humans call that irony.&quot; Jr. grunted,
	&quot;Trying to wax philosophy on me again?&quot; Gaignun faked offence at 
the remark,
	&quot;Oh I am so appalled by your statement...&quot; He looked out the 
window to see a few 100-series lounging in the park. &quot;...It&#39;s not about 
the upgrade is it?&quot; Jr. snorted and vengefully replied,
	&quot;What else could there be?&quot; Gaignun unfolded his arms and slid his 
slender hands into his pockets.
	&quot;The 101-Series will be finish in three months...once their here 
you will have to discontinue use of the 100-series.&quot; Jr. grunted,
	&quot;Why the hell would you care!&quot; He yelled knowing exactly were this 
conversation was going.
	&quot;The 100-series were the last observational realians made by 
Mizrahi lads...the 101-series are being built by the Hyams Industry and 
they look nothing like Sakura.&quot; Jr. uncrossed his arms but his fists 
were still clenched in rage,
	&quot;You think I enjoy being reminded of the only woman I ever 
loved?!&quot; Gaignun looked serious for a moment,
	&quot;My guess if that you don&#39;t want to forget your failure.&quot; The door 
of the elevator opened and the two of them stepped out, Jr.&#39;s knuckles 
were white now and he could barely handle the voice of his younger 
brother.
	&quot;I know you care for Sakura a lot but...&quot; He was cut off by Jr.&#39;s 
fist landing hard against his rib cage.
	&quot;I told you to leave me the hell alone!&quot; Jr. stormed down the 
hallway towards his office. Gaignun could hear the door slam shut like a 
bolt of lightening. He then looked at the 669 stamped on his hand.
	&quot;You sounded just like your twin at that moment...I wish he was 
still here. He was the only one who ever could get through to you.&quot; He 
looked over his shoulder as if expecting someone to be there but no one 
was. He thought to himself making sure Jr. didn&#39;t hear his thoughts.
	Oh Albedo. Even with all you had done he still listened to you. I 
can&#39;t even brake his shell...even with how much I care for my brothers. 
He turned to head for his office,
	I know you hated me for loving you but...I wish you could have 
been here to help me. Gaignun searched the back of his brain for any 
sign of the dead U.R.T.V. but like always found nothing.
	&quot;I guess we all have to struggle to put things in the past.&quot; He 
almost jumped at the voice behind him.
	&quot;Put what in the past Masta Gaignun.&quot; Came the voice of Mary. He 
turned around after quickly changing his composure.
	He flashed a gentle smile.
	&quot;Nothing Mary, would you happen to know were your sister is? I 
need some of the upgraded start charts she had been analyzing.&quot; Gaignun 
continued his personal fa&#135;ade while the two of them walked down the 
hallway.
