<h1>Tears of Toys (part 6 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/albedoright.html">Albedo's right hand</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/teartoy-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>	Shion, Momo and KOS-MOS walked towards there sleeping quarters 
onboard the Elsa. Gaignun had shown up a short time after breakfast and 
invited everyone to his personal beach. Needless to say everyone was 
surprised but still accepted his offer.
	The three of them entered their quarters and while Shion and Momo 
soon found their swimsuits, KOS-MOS just stood there. Momo picked up a 
towel and looked over to KOS-MOS who was just standing there. 
	&quot;KOS-MOS is water proof right?&quot; Momo asked to Shion who was still 
looking for her towel.
	&quot;Well of course. It would be embarrassing if she is capable of 
obliterating thousands of gnosis but could be stopped by a single drop 
of water.&quot; Shion replied with a smile fueled by her ego.
	&quot;Then why not give her a swimsuit?&quot; Momo said trying her best to 
sound as innocent as possible. Shion&#39;s ego driven smile increased,
	&quot;Actually it was Miyuki&#39;s idea. I was hoping to test it out.&quot; She 
said holding up her connection gear. She soon found her towel and the 
three of them walked out towards the shuttle on the Durandle.
	&quot;So umm...Can I see it?&quot; Momo asked while they walked sounded 
almost too eager. Shion giggled and replied,
	&quot;When we get to the beach you can will see it. I am using phasing 
technology, which is the same thing that transmits KOS-MOS&#39;s weapons 
into her hands. Momo looked up to meet eyes with KOS-MOS and the android 
suddenly blushed.
	
	Jr. was disrupted from his dismal solitude by the Iron 4 theme 
playing from a device in his pocket. He grumbled knowing all too well 
that only one person had access to that communicator.
	He pulled the small waterproof earpiece out of his short&#39;s pocket 
and put it in his ear.
	&quot;Damn it! What do you want from me Gaignun?&quot; He growled sitting 
up. 
	&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind but I invited Shion and the others to my 
personal beach.&quot; Jr. almost fell off his floating beach chair at 
Gaignun&#39;s words.
	&quot;Why the hell did you do that?&quot; He screamed. Gaignun simply 
replied,
	&quot;Why would it matter if you&#39;re not there?&quot; Jr. was glad he was 
able to scream with out anyone being able to hear him.
	&quot;I am at the beach you idiot of a younger brother!&quot; He felt 
compelled to throw the earpiece into the calm blue waters but resisted 
so he could yell some more.
	Jr. looked to his right to see Shion and the rest of them walk 
onto the beach, and he was suddenly glad he was far enough so that they 
looked liked blurs.

	Shion and Momo walked out of their changing stalls to reveal their 
swimsuits while KOS-MOS was standing there in her full battle attire. 
Ziggy was sitting at a table trying to stay far away from the water. The 
other males were still changing and Momo and Shion stared at KOS-MOS.
	&quot;Well Shion, change KOS-MOS.&quot; Momo said still trying to sound as 
innocent as possible. Shion held up her connection gear and pressed a 
few buttons.
	The familiar blue light was now engulfing the android and within 
seconds the process was over. KOS-MOS&#39;s usual cloths for a very 
revealing one-piece swimsuit made out of a silvery material.
      &quot;Shion. This swimsuit is constricting on the upper chest. Please 
modify this attire to more properly fit me.&quot; 
	&quot;No! Don&#39;t! It looks fine...No! I mean great!&quot; Momo blurted out 
while blushing profusely at the sight before her eyes. Momo felt that 
same feeling from when KOS-MOS whispered in her ear. She knew she had to 
hide it some how.
	Momo ran into the glistening waters calling out to the others to 
play with her. KOS-MOS quickly followed while Shion grabbed the beach 
ball.
	&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to play with us chaos?&quot; She asked seeing the 
sliver haired boy sitting down at a table that the cyborg was already 
seated at. He looked up and replied in a soft tone,
	&quot;I&#39;ll be over there soon, but I promised to help Ziggy out.&quot; Shion 
smiled sweetly,
	&quot;Alright see you later.&quot; She tossed the beach ball towards KOS-MOS 
and ran off into the gentle waters. chaos held up a wrench that Ziggy 
had brought with him.
	&quot;Please tighten the bolts on the upper shoulder plate close to the 
pneumatics connected to the biceps.&quot; Chaos went to work on the robotic 
arm knowing exactly how it functioned but enjoyed pretending as if he 
knew nothing about it.
	After some time of the three woman playing in the glistening 
waters the mysterious boy was still working on the arm while Ziggy just 
sat there with an eye of examination towards the form of KOS-MOS. chaos 
spoke softly even though there was no need to,
	&quot;So Ziggy, what do you think?&quot; The youth asked looking out over 
the waters. The cyborg broke his stare and looked at the silver haired 
boy,
	&quot;What is it you are asking about?&quot; Ziggy replied wondering if the 
mysterious youth knew of his newfound secret.
	&quot;Momo and KOS-MOS. They seem to enjoy each others company.&quot; Ziggy 
brought his human hand up to his cold chin as if to think deeply but his 
mind was made up a long time ago.
	&quot;When I was still Jan Sauer my team once busted this guy who was 
buying and selling realians as if they were mere currency.&quot; Chaos 
blinked and asked,
	&quot;What would that have to do with this?&quot; The boy spoke knowing what 
the cyborg would say but enjoyed playing the fool. The cyborg continued 
with a sigh and with each word his emotions leaked through,
	&quot;During the investigation we discovered the heart of a massive 
realian sex trade program that was spread across five planets. We 
rescued two thousand and seventy two realians most of them even had 
illegal upgrades against their wills. The whole thing sickened me to the 
very core.&quot; Chaos knew the conversation wasn&#39;t over,
	&quot;Is that why you seem worried about it?&quot; Ziggy sighed calming 
himself down,
	&quot;I guess I can&#39;t help but view her as a child. I felt the same way 
when she told me she was going out with Jr.&quot; Chaos smiled in his usual 
way,
	&quot;You really are like a father to her to worry so much for her.&quot; 
Ziggy looked back into the tranquil waters.
	&quot;I guess this is what happens when people create beings blessed 
with the everlasting youth that mankind has always been searching for 
since the beginning of time.&quot; Chaos followed his gaze to see Momo toss 
the ball over to KOS-MOS,
	&quot;Blessed...To her she feels cursed by that youth. She feels like 
she can never be truly treated like a woman as long as he has that body. 
She is a woman in mind and wishes for the body she so rightfully 
deserves.&quot; Ziggy looked back at the angelic boy surprised by the remark,
	&quot;chaos. You always seem to know more than your letting on, so I 
wont force a reply about what I am going to ask. When KOS-MOS promised 
me she would protect Momo, she seemed almost...Human. Would you know 
anything about this?&quot; chaos didn&#39;t lose his composure,
	&quot;Thank you for respecting my privacy, but I will tell you this...&quot; 
He paused as he looked at the cerulean haired android, &quot;...What ever you 
see in KOS-MOS was already there since she was first created.&quot; Chaos 
sighed knowing his next words would be a lie,
	&quot;It is truly a shame only one person for sure knew everything 
about her.&quot; Ziggy looked at the youth,
	&quot;You are talking about Kevin Winnicot, correct?&quot; The silver haired 
youth simply nodded his head.
