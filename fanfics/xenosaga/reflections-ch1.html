I knew the warmth of her essence even before I existed as a fully 
realized personality. Shion was one of my group of primary programmers, 
her strings of code weaving in with all of my other creators to produce 
the gestalt of my personality. Directives, commands, subroutines all 
carried traces of her careful touch.

My first awakening... it only comes to me in broken fragments of memory, 
nightmarish images splashed red with blood and chaos. Studying the 
surviving records tells me a flaw in my program caused me to lash out at 
my human creators, becoming a efficient machine for killing. Only Shion 
survived, spared by some twist of fate or circumstance, something that I 
am eternally happy for. Afterwards Shion and others worked to rewrite 
the codes and eliminate the problems, ultimately succeeding after long 
months of work.

Still largely &#39;asleep&#39; I experienced virtual reality combat in Vector 
Industries labs, and Shion was always there by my side. Her red-brown 
hair flowing she stood beside me in hundreds of virtual environments and 
scenarios, talking to me gently as I fought against our enemies and I 
always watched over her. I battled again and again, destroying our foes 
for the greatest of rewards... Shion&#39;s approving words and smile.

I don&#39;t know how long a time passed until I was fully awakened once 
again. I do know what awakened me from my sleep... it wasn&#39;t the attack 
on the ship or the danger that was facing the lab crew surrounding my 
chamber. No, it was the sure and absolute knowledge that somewhere on 
the ship Shion was in danger.

Using capabilities that I didn&#39;t know I had I overrode all the 
containment systems, bringing myself up to full wakefulness in the first 
time in many months. With barely a thought I rose from the containment 
chamber, still burdened with the cumbersome exo-armor and in a burst of 
power I removed it all. A sleek, steel skinned figure I walked away, 
determined to find and save Shion... even if I had to violate my other 
directives to do it.

Tapping into ship&#39;s sensors and my own capabilities I found her, tearing 
a swath through the invading Gnost forces to do it. The enemy had cut 
through our armies, defeating them with ease and now Shion stood 
defenseless. A Gnost had her, it&#39;s deadly touch working on her when I 
burst in. The wall cut away under my blade and the Gnost freed her, 
sensing a greater threat.

My gaze swept the chamber and I saw Shion again... meeting those 
beautiful eyes behind her glasses. Despite the emotions that were 
surging within my heart I didn&#39;t react, focused on my task. The relief 
and joy I felt could have crippled me, slowing me down in battle but I 
couldn&#39;t let that happen. Shion had to be protected.

&quot;KOS MOS,&quot; Shion breathed out in recognition and I shivered in pleasure 
at the sound of her voice, turning away so that she couldn&#39;t see my 
face.

Winning the battle was easy, but what came after that was much harder 
for me, ordering the survivors into a lifepod and leaving them while I 
faced the Gnost. I wanted to go along with them, and I was surprised at 
the concern Shion showed for me, but their chances where better on their 
own.

Her assistant I simply shoved down the tube, ignoring his weak protests 
over the odds... Shion I took into my arms. Up till that point I hadn&#39;t 
been aware of how sensitive my outer shell could be, regarding it simply 
as protective armor. But holding Shion close I could feel the warmth of 
her flesh, her breasts pressed to mine and it took all my will for my 
arms not to shake. With delicacy a set her in the tube and let her go, 
our eyes meeting in a moment to send a silent farewell... then I turned 
to face battle once again.

In my heart I knew we would be reunited.

From the Private Journals of Shion Uzuki

Arranging for a vacation for myself from Vector was hard enough... I had 
to bring up the fact that I had built up over two years worth of off 
days. Bringing KOS MOS along with me was even harder, but my prepared 
arguments won them over. As a synthetic human she had emotions and 
stress, too, and relieving that stress was only wise.. especially 
considering the importance of her role. It also helped that we had 
established some powerful friends over the past few months, and they had 
helped push for the break too.

KOS MOS is a unique combination of an innocent and worldly woman, 
something that I have to always keep in mind. In combat and in other 
tactical areas she is nearly unstoppable, her experiences in virtual 
reality and in the field making her a superb warrior. However her 
experience in casual interactions and human relations are quite 
seriously lacking, and I&#39;ve taken it upon myself to try to remedy that.

Of course, I didn&#39;t count on my own powerful emotional reaction to her. 
I&#39;ve always felt a bond with the synthetic humans, and I thought that my 
concern for KOS MOS came from that but I&#39;ve had to increasingly question 
that assumption. Beginning with stripping KOS MOS of her armor in the 
local Vector Industries Lab.

I&#39;ve been aware in a abstract way that KOS MOS was female, but it wasn&#39;t 
an issue with all of her armor in place. But as I removed her visor and 
let free her long hair, then began to disengage her breast plate I felt 
my breath quicken, so much so that KOS MOS was concerned for my health. 
Reassuring her as much as I was able I tried not to gaze at the fullness 
of her body, the pale flesh that had been hidden beneath armored chrome, 
and instead focused on my work. She looked like some kind of modern 
Venus emerging from a technological sea when I was done, a achingly 
beautiful figure, and I knew I was in trouble.

&quot;Shion,&quot; KOS MOS met my eyes with her red ones, her light blue hair 
falling in front her eyes and in a wave down her back as she quietly 
said, &quot;I&#39;m still not comfortable about removing my armor and most of my 
weapons.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right KOS MOS,&quot; Shion looked up at her reassuringly as they 
walked away from the hotel together, &quot;we shouldn&#39;t need to fight for 
now, the Gnost seem to have pulled back to lick their wounds.&quot; Seeing 
the faint question in her eyes a smiling Shion explained, &quot;I mean, 
they&#39;re taking some time to recover.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; KOS MOS nodded in understanding.

Shion adjusted her light jacket, her light swimsuit beneath it hugging 
her body. Beside her KOS MOS walked in a similar costume, but she filled 
it out much more than Shion could. The taller woman was likely unaware 
of the reactions to her beauty, but Shion was surprised to feel jealousy 
as she possessively watched over KOS MOS.

&quot;Watch your step,&quot; KOS MOS gently took Shion&#39;s hand as they climbed down 
the path to the deserted private beach, the summer sun washing over 
them.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shion murmured as she hopped down the last way to the 
beach, her hand tingling faintly under KOS MOS&#39; touch. Keeping hold of 
her hand Shion walked them down to the water, the breeze blowing their 
hair back. The breeze had brought a bit of color to KOS MOS&#39; skin, and a 
surprisingly unguarded expression of delight as she gazed out at the 
waves hitting the beach made her look even more beautiful.

&quot;Shion,&quot; KOS MOS looked at her, &quot;your pulse rate has risen again, and 
I&#39;m detecting a increase in the temperature of your skin due to a rush 
of blood.&quot;

Shion tried to bring her blush under control, looking away from her 
fascination with KOS MOS&#39; beauty. &quot;It&#39;s a involuntary reaction,&quot; she 
decided to be honest, &quot;that happens in response to physical attraction 
or embarrassment.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re embarrassed?&quot; KOS MOS asked quietly, taking Shion&#39;s hand in 
both of hers.

&quot;No, I seem to be having the other reaction,&quot; Shion softly admitted as 
they stood there on the warm sands.

KOS MOS squeezed her hand softly as she met Shion&#39;s eyes. &quot;It seems that 
synthetic human bodies do not have the same reactions, then,&quot; she said 
regretfully, &quot;or I would be suffering from many of the same symptoms.&quot;

Shion felt her eyes widen, &quot; KOS MOS?&quot;

Looking away shyly it almost seemed like KOS MOS was blushing. &quot;Shion, 
you are the most important person to me,&quot; she quietly explained, &quot;I 
would protect you even if my programming did not require it.&quot; She 
reached up to stroke Shion&#39;s cheek, &quot;Being with you makes me happy, and 
when duty takes me away from you it hurts so much... I ache with it.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Shion reached up to rub her cheek against KOS MOS&#39; hand. 
Giving in to a urge she had fought for months she stepped forward, 
wrapping her arms around KOS MOS and resting her head on her shoulder.

KOS MOS stood stiffly for a moment then let her arms close around Shion, 
holding her gently. They stood there a long moment, each taking comfort 
from the other then KOS MOS drew back a little, gazing down in Shion&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;I feel so much for you,&quot; KOS MOS murmured, &quot;but I don&#39;t know what 
to do...&quot;

&quot;Neither do I,&quot; Shion admitted as she smiled up at her lovingly, &quot;but I 
think we&#39;ll figure it out, given a little time.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; KOS MOS agreed happily. &quot;There is something I saw once...&quot;

Shion looked curious, &quot;Yes?&quot;

KOS MOS bent forward to press her lips to Shion&#39;s in a gentle kiss, the 
startled Shion pulling her close barely a moment later. They stood there 
locked in the kiss for a happy eternity, then reluctantly pulled apart. 
&quot;Was that all right?&quot; KOS MOS asked.

&quot;Better than all right,&quot; Shion laughed happily, &quot;if that was what your 
first kiss is like I can&#39;t wait until you get practice.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we can practice more when we go back to our hotel room,&quot; KOS MOS 
said, her voice surprisingly purring.

Shion blushed again.

End

Notes: This was inspired by much of the very suggestive official art 
from the Xenosaga games and bits of the animated series. This &#39;break 
period&#39; between major storylines is something I made up, though I don&#39;t 
find it hard to imagine the work obsessed Shion not taking normal 
vacations. I kind of doubt KOS MOS&#39; armor is really removable, I just 
made that up.</pre>
