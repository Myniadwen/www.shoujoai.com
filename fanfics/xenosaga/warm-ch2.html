<h1>Warm (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbman.html">cbman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/warm-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Author&#39;s note: Well, by popular demand, I&#39;m continuing this fic. 
Anyway, in this chapter, we have another player added into Shion and
KOS-MOS&#39;s relationship. And just to warn you ahead of time, Shion 
might be a little bit out of character, I couldn&#39;t avoid unfortunately.
Oh, and for you guys who are waiting for Ziggy&#39;s and Jr.&#39;s appearance 
in this fic, sorry, they won&#39;t appear until the next chapter. Well, 
without further ado, let&#39;s get to the story.

She said she loved me, did she really mean it? The way she spoke to me 
when she said it, it was the same way she always spoke. She never has
any feeling in her voice, how am I supposed to be able tell that she 
meant what she said. KOS-MOS, do you really love me? If you do love me,
do you love me the same way I love you, or is the love you have for me 
the love a child would have for their mother?

&quot;Hey, Miss Vector!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Water!&quot; Captain Matthews pushes his cup in my direction.

&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; I apologize as I pour him a glass.

&quot;Shion, are you okay?&quot; MOMO asks me with a tug on my sleeve.

&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;
MOMO, there she goes again pretending as if nothing happened between 
her and Albedo. It almost brings a tear to my eye every time I see her 
like this. I can tell that she&#39;s doing her best to hide her sadness, 
because every time I look into her eyes, I can see a hint of tears.

&quot;You&#39;ve been acting like you&#39;re somewhere else since you woke up this 
morning,&quot; MOMO points out. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; I answer with the shake of my head.

&quot;Water&quot; Matthews shoves his empty cup to me again.

Just as I pour the contents of the pitcher once more, the diner&#39;s door 
begins to hum. The clacking of shoes comes closer and closer until it 
stops right next to me. I turn to the footsteps have ceased and look up
to find the blue-haired angel I dreamt of even after my slumber.

&quot;Good morning, KOS-MOS,&quot; I greet her.

&quot;Good morning, Shion,&quot; she says in her monotonous voice.

Without wasting another moment, she already begins to walk away from me
and walks to the other side of the diner. Not a shred of emotion, 
that&#39;s so typical of her, just how am I supposed to believe what she 
said last night? Still, I can&#39;t help but think about, I can&#39;t help but 
think about the kiss I stole from her lips.

&quot;Chief. Chief.&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

&quot;Can I have some water, please?&quot; Allen hands me his cup.

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; I begin to pour him a glass, only to have the contents 
fill a quarter of his glass. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I apologize, &quot;I guess I 
must&#39;ve given the rest to the captain.&quot;

&quot;What, so it&#39;s my fault all of a sudden?&quot; Matthews asks as he stuffs 
his face again, only to stand up a second later, lurching forward with 
his mouth hacking.

&quot;He&#39;s choking!&quot; Allen states the obvious.

&quot;I&#39;ll go get some more water&quot; MOMO runs to the kitchen.

Jumping into action, I hurry to the captain and begin pounding my palm 
against his back. It doesn&#39;t seem to help as he continues to pound his 
chest and cough.

&quot;Captain, what happened?&quot; Tony suddenly enters the diner.

&quot;He&#39;s choking!&quot; I inform him. &quot;Help me out here!&quot;

The two of us begin patting his back even harder, and still nothing 
comes out. My ears begin to pick up the noise of clacking once again 
in between the coughs of the captain. A black-gloved hand suddenly 
reaches from behind my shoulder and strikes Matthews in the back and 
suddenly the coughing dies as a piece of curry flies to the other side 
of the room.

&quot;KOS-MOS?&quot; I turn around to find her blank face.

&quot;Eating too fast can cause problems such as this,&quot; she says in her 
monotone voice, &quot;I suggest you try eating slower next time.&quot;
Without another word, she begins to head back to her side of the diner.

Is it just me, or did she ignore me back there?

&quot;KOS-MOS, that was very rude&quot; I scold her from afar.

&quot;No, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Matthews says in between his gasps.

&quot;Um, I brought some more water,&quot; I look behind me to find MOMO holding 
a newly filled pitcher.

&quot;Your assistance is too late I&#39;m afraid,&quot; KOS-MOS tells the young 
realian without a shred of emotion in her voice, &quot;you needn&#39;t bother 
with that item in your hands.&quot;

&quot;KOS-MOS, just what is wrong with you today?&quot; I yell as she walks past 
the two of us.

There she goes again ignoring me. I swear, she can be such a handful at
times. Still, that doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t care about her, I just wish I 
could&#39;ve programmed some more emotions into her, maybe then she would
act a bit nicer.

I chase after her a second later, I can&#39;t stand the way she&#39;s treating 
the others this morning. I find her in the middle of the hallway with 
her back turned, her boots still clacking as she makes her way to the
elevator.

&quot;KOS-MOS!&quot; I call.

The clacking of her boots stops once more as her feet come to a halt. 
Her body begins to turn toward me with her red eyes once again blank 
and her lips unmoving.

&quot;Yes, Shion?&quot;

The way she speaks, it&#39;s as if nothing happened between us last night. 
I should&#39;ve known better, I shouldn&#39;t have even bothered seeing her 
last night.

&quot;KOS-MOS, you&#39;ve been acting very rude this morning!&quot; I scold her. 

&quot;First you hit Captain Matthews in the back and then you tell MOMO&#133;&#133;&quot;

&quot;There was a 35.46666% ratio that the captain would have suffocated if 
he continued to have the ration of beef lodged in his throat, there was
a 10.44322% ratio that water would have freed the ration of beef from 
his throat, and there was a 2.124333% ratio that your efforts would 
have saved the captain, the only action that had the highest percent 
ratio to save the captain&#39;s life was to take action myself by striking 
the spinal cord of the captain,&quot; KOS-MOS spoke as if she were giving 
me a report.

&quot;That&#39;s not the point, KOS-MOS!&quot; I yell. &quot;You said you loved me, and 
yet, here you are ignoring me as if nothing happened between us last 
night. Do you think you can just step on my heart and get away with 
it?&quot;

She pauses for a moment. The expression her face does not change. Her 
mouth begins to move and I prepare for the worst.

&quot;It was impossible for me to be able to step on your heart last night 
when I was lying down and you were bent over,&quot; she says. &quot;Though it 
would&#39;ve been possible for me to reach my hand into your chest and 
then remove or crush it with...&quot;

My eyes suddenly began to burn and my fingers began to twitch. I could
feel my teeth grinding against one another as my fingers began to curl
into a fist. Before I knew it, my arm suddenly came forward, my palm 
free from my fingers.  The air began slicing through the gaps between 
my fingers, but it only lasted for a second before my hand met with 
artificial skin. My hand burnt for a moment after it met with her 
cheek, tilting her head to the side in the moment after.

&quot;How could you say such a thing?&quot; my voice began to crack. &quot;Of course 
you crushed it, KOS-MOS! Of course it was possible for you to step on 
my heart!&quot;

&quot;...I do not understand,&quot; was all she said.

My eyes were burning even more than ever and my heart felt as if it had
been pried from my body. The feeling of anger and sadness was something
I had not felt in a long time, something I never wanted to feel again. 
The weight of my eyes began to pull my head to the floor, my legs suddenly
shifting forward as my entire being brushed past the android.

Just what was I thinking, of course she didn&#39;t mean it when she said 
she loved me. Then why did she say it? Was it a natural reaction, or 
was she taunting me? How could I have fallen for someone like her? No, 
she isn&#39;t a someone, she&#39;s an android, just a walking mass of bolts and
screws I put my heart into making her, and yet, she treats me like...

&quot;Is something the matter, Shion?&quot;

Before I turn around, I quickly bring my fingers across the rivers 
flowing down my cheeks and take a moment to push my braid back. I take 
a small breath after, turning around a second later to face the one who
called me.

&quot;Hello, chaos,&quot; I greet the silver-haired boy.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; he asks again.

&quot;I&#39;m doing fine,&quot; I nod, putting on my best smile, &quot;why?&quot;

&quot;I just passed KOS-MOS a little while ago,&quot; he brought up, &quot;she looked 
rather upset about something.&quot;

&quot;Upset, what would she have to be sad about?&quot; I say, pretending nothing
happened a moment ago.

&quot;Did something happen between you two?&quot; he asks.

&quot;No, nothing,&quot; I answer with the shake of my head.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with what happened last night, does 
it?&quot;

My mouth suddenly goes dry with the mention of what happened the other 
night. How could he have seen what happened, I thought the door was 
closed the entire time.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Shion, I won&#39;t tell anyone what happened,&quot; he assures me.

&quot;Thank you, chaos.&quot;

I begin to turn away and make my way to my cabin, only to stop a second
later.

&quot;She loves you too,&quot; his voice brings my steps to a halt.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Deep down inside, underneath all of that data and parts, she truly 
does love you, Shion.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a lie&quot; I begin to raise my voice. &quot;Don&#39;t try and console me 
with such lies What makes you think you can...!&quot;

&quot;I can tell by the sincerity in her voice that night,&quot; he explains, 
&quot;there was something underneath her voice that...&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I turn around with my fists clenched. 
&quot;There was nothing underneath her voice, it was in the same monotone 
expression it was always in!&quot;

&quot;True, it sounded cold, but didn&#39;t it feel like there was something 
else there, something that hinted some warmth?&quot;

Warmth, there was nothing really warm in what she said. Her voice was 
as cold as ever when she said those words, and yet, her lips, they were
warm. Why was her mouth warm, I don&#39;t recall designing her mouth to be 
warm. I mean, I did my best to make her look human in terms of 
appearance, but I never worked on things such as her body temperature 
and the such.

&quot;They were warm,&quot; my fingers began to trace my lips.

&quot;Well, I hope you two will be able to work things out,&quot; the silver-
haired boy began to leave.

That boy never ceases to amaze me. It all began when we first arrived 
on the Elsa, when chaos saved the commander from the Gnosis. A simple 
touch was all it took to free the commander, I never understood how 
that boy was able to do that. During our journey, he was always calm, 
he never lost his cool, it was as if he knew what was going on this 
whole time. Even if he does know what&#39;s going on, I know for a fact 
that he&#39;s not our enemy, I can feel it. He&#39;s definitely wise beyond his
years, perhaps more than beyond. I guess our quest would fall apart 
without chaos, but, there&#39;s something else about him, there&#39;s something
I feel only when he&#39;s around, it&#39;s similar to that feeling I got from 
KOS-MOS when she absorbed the legions of Gnosis. Oh never mind, I&#39;m 
just so flustered this morning after what happened last night. I&#39;m not 
sure what to think of at the moment. KOS-MOS, was what chaos said true,
was she really sad? I should go and apologize to her then.

The door to the A.G.W.S. hanger hums once more as I enter. My shoes 
clack twice before the door shuts once more. The sound of sniffles 
echoes in the air, sniffles that I have never heard before. It&#39;s a 
woman&#39;s cry, and there is only one woman who I can think of that&#39;s 
making that cry. I take another moment to fix my hair and straighten 
the ruffles in my clothing, it would probably only make her feel worse 
if she saw me in the condition I was. I take in a deep breath and make 
my way toward the lift, only to stop the second my blue-haired angel 
comes into view sitting along side another.

&quot;Don&#39;t cry,&quot; the silver-haired boy tells her, &quot;crying doesn&#39;t befit a 
woman such as yourself.&quot;

chaos, what is he doing here?

&quot;I do not understand,&quot; I turn to the blue-haired angel as she weeps, 
&quot;I don&#39;t understand her emotions at all. She said she loved me, but 
then she...&quot;

&quot;You broke her heart.&quot;

&quot;I do not understand,&quot; she repeats, &quot;I didn&#39;t harm her at all, my 
programming will not allow me to...&quot;

&quot;Human emotions are more fragile than the body, KOS-MOS,&quot; he explains.

How true his words are. What KOS-MOS did to Kevin years ago, that did 
more damage to my heart than it could ever do to my body.

&quot;I still don&#39;t understand!&quot; her face buries into her palms.

&quot;You&#39;re not the only one,&quot; he places his hand around her shoulder. 

&quot;No one can understand another human being&#39;s emotions perfectly. Just 
when you think you have them solved, another mystery appears, so you&#39;re
not alone when you say you don&#39;t understand.&quot;

Her face begins to pull away from her palms, her red eyes still leaking
from tears and her lips still frowning. Her eyes begin to close 
suddenly and her body begins to move forward. Her lips suddenly begin 
to take the lead of her advance and she falls forward. They both fall 
to the hanger&#39;s metal floor, her body firmly pressed up against his as
her mouth presses against the lips of the silver-haired boy.

My heart shatters for the second time that day, and suddenly I find my 
eyes burning even more than ever. Without wanting to witness another 
second of this inconceivable act, I quickly turn away, with my head 
tilted toward the floor and my heart now broken for the last time...

Author&#39;s Note: Poor Shion. The story&#39;s not going to end here 
fortunately, there&#39;s some other drama that will be added later on. 
In the next chapter, we look into MOMO&#39;s depression a bit more, so
we will be seeing Ziggy and Jr. there. Again, sorry if you were looking
forward to their appearances in this chapter. So until next time, go 
ahead and leave me a review, but no flames, okay? Later people!
