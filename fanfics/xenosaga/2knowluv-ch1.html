<h1>To Know Love</h1>

<pre>&quot;Shion, what is love?&quot; 

      It was such an unexpected question that Shion almost thought she 
was just imagining things.  What a time to ask such a thing!  chaos had 
just returned with Jr. and it was quite obvious that something had 
happened, and KOS-MOS was asking about love!  &quot;Why do you want to know?&quot; 
Shion replied, trying to sound sincere. 

      KOS-MOS&#39;s face was as emotionless as ever.  &quot;I do not understand 
it.&quot; 

      Shion had to suppress a laugh.  &quot;It&#39;s not something that&#39;s easily 
understood,&quot; she began, a small smile forming on her face.  &quot;Love is-&quot; 
she hesitated, trying to find the right words, &quot;-an intense feeling one 
feels for another.  You see this person, and you think about how 
wonderful they make you feel.&quot; 

      &quot;Is that how you felt toward Kevin?&quot;  KOS-MOS showed no signs that 
she understood what Shion had said, but nor did she show any signs of 
confusion. 

      The mention of Kevin pierced Shion&#39;s heart like a knife.  &quot;Yeah, I 
guess it was like that,&quot; she mumbled.  Kevin&#39;s death was still fresh in 
her mind, but she refused to show that it continued to pain her.  

      KOS-MOS took a few steps closer to Shion.  &quot;And kissing is a way 
to show love?&quot; the android assumed. 

      &quot;Sometimes,&quot; Shion answered.  &quot;Kissing can also be used as way to 
show simple affection, like friendship.  Why do you ask?&quot; 

      &quot;Kiss me like you love me,&quot; KOS-MOS ordered flatly. 

      Shion&#39;s face instantly became a bright red.  How could KOS-MOS 
even order such as thing?  Even she had to understand that romantic 
kissing wasn&#39;t something done lightly.  &quot;I can&#39;t do that!&quot; Shion blurted 
out, her heart racing wildly.  &quot;I can&#39;t pretend love!&quot; 

      &quot;Then just kiss me,&quot; was KOS-MOS&#39;s response.  She was impossible 
for Shion to read. 

      Shion gulped.  KOS-MOS was beautiful, and Shion had imagined 
kissing her a few times.  Shion did care very much for KOS-MOS, but it 
was only platonic affection, wasn&#39;t it?  Kissing KOS-MOS wouldn&#39;t be 
such a big deal.  It would just be the friendship type of kiss, not the 
love type.  Or would it? 

      &quot;O-Okay,&quot; Shion said nervously, laying her hands on KOS-MOS&#39;s 
shoulders.  &quot;H-Here I come.&quot;  Shion slowly pulled herself toward 
KOS-MOS, still wondering if this kiss would be platonic or romantic.  It 
felt like forever before their lips touched. 

      As soon as Shion kissed KOS-MOS, the answer was clear.  Those 
intense feelings Shion had locked away in her heart came rushing out and 
she wrapped her arms tightly around KOS-MOS.  Maybe it was strange that 
she felt this way toward an android, but as her lips were together with 
KOS-MOS&#39;s, that thought never invaded her mind.  All that mattered was 
how wonderful KOS-MOS made her feel inside. 

      When the kiss ended, KOS-MOS said nothing.  Shion couldn&#39;t be sure 
if KOS-MOS knew what type of kiss they had shared.  Calmly, KOS-MOS 
backed away from Shion and left her alone. 

      Shion couldn&#39;t help but smile broadly.  &quot;That was a romantic kiss, 
KOS-MOS,&quot; she whispered quietly.  &quot;Maybe someday you&#39;ll understand.&quot;</pre>
