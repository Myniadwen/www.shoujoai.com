<h1>Bound (part 6 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbman.html">cbman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/bound-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Author&#39;s Note: Hey guys, sorry for the long wait in updating, but I was
in writer&#39;s block for a while on how to write this chapter.  In this 
chapter, we have a few more revelations for KOS-MOS (or rather &quot;Elly&quot; 
as she&#39;ll be referred to from now on by Shion and the original 
archetype,&quot;Miang&quot;) so that means more angst for our poor heroine.  
Yeah, Elly seems pretty weak compared to her video game counterpart in 
this story, but I guarantee that she&#39;ll start kicking ass again in the 
next chapter.  And Jin, yeah I know he and Shion have been fighting 
quite a bit and he&#39;s been somewhat of a comedy relief character, but I 
assure you he&#39;ll start to take up a more serious role starting with 
this chapter (but you can still expect him and Shion to argue from time
to time like most siblings do).  The ff.net version has some edited 
scenes in this chapter, I&#39;m sure you all know where to find the uncut 
version by now.  Things may be confusing in this chapter, the pacing is
slow at parts, and a few more questions will arise, but please bear 
with it and I&#39;ll answer all questions and other mysteries that were 
made in this story in the next chapter.  Why, because this story&#39;s 
almost done, two chapters left and this story&#39;s finished.  In any case,
let&#39;s get to the story.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A small breeze begins to fill the air for a mere second and I can&#39;t 
help but look in the direction it flew.  It leads my vision to the 
forest, stopping it before a tree branch where a yellow finch is 
perched.  A small chirp escapes its beak and I can&#39;t help but smile at 
its melody.  I find myself walking closer toward the conductor of the 
song with my eyes growing wider with every step I take.  The image of 
the bird grows closer and closer, but by the time it grows close enough
for me to touch, a loud bang fills the area and the bird is replaced by
a shower of feathers.  I can&#39;t help but gasp at the sight of the bird&#39;s
death as my legs suddenly grow numb and my breath short. The air begins
to grow thin at that moment and a fog begins to roll in, shielding my 
vision from the forest.
     
&quot;I hate birds,&quot; a voice echoes from behind me.
     
&quot;Miang!&quot; I yell my sister&#39;s name as I turn toward her.
     
&quot;Such fragile creatures they are,&quot; she begins to speak.  &quot;They sing 
such beautiful songs that can calm anyone&#39;s heart, but if you grow 
close enough to them, they fly away without a moment&#39;s notice.  Why do 
they sing?&quot; she asks as she begins to approach me.  &quot;Kevin once said
that they sing to attract others toward them, but when others do grow 
close, they flee.  It&#39;s true, don&#39;t you think?&quot;
     
&quot;Miang, I know what you&#39;re thinking,&quot; my eyes narrow as she draws 
closer, &quot;you think you can still tear me and Shion apart, but you know 
what, that&#39;s not going to happen!  Shion loves me, and I love her, 
there&#39;s nothing and no one that can change that, not even you!  I don&#39;t
care what you do to me, Miang, but you can&#39;t make me stop loving Shion 
nor can you make her stop loving me just because of what happened 
between you, her, and Kevin in the past!&quot;
     
&quot;I don&#39;t have to make her stop loving you,&quot; my sister says calmly, &quot;in 
fact, she&#39;ll stop loving you on her own.&quot;
     
&quot;Lies!&quot; I retort.
     
&quot;How much patience do you think she actually has?&quot; Miang continues.  
&quot;Do you really think she can continue to forgive you over and over 
again for your actions?&quot;
     
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
     
&quot;There&#39;s a limit to everyone&#39;s patience, even your so-called &#39;lover&#39; 
will run out of it,&quot; her lecture continues.  &quot;How many times do you 
think she&#39;ll forgive you for upsetting her, for worrying her, or for 
ravaging her?&quot;
     
&quot;I...,&quot; I am unable to find any words to respond with.  &quot;You said 
&#39;ravage her,&#39;&quot; I recall her last words soon after, &quot;just what makes you
think I would do such a thing?  What we do is make...&quot;
     
&quot;Coat your words with as much sugar as you like, but as I said before, 
making love and rape is the same thing, it&#39;s sex, and we all know what 
the goal of sex is,&quot; she quickly interrupts.
     
&quot;Regardless, when Shion and I do have sex, it&#39;s pleasing to both of 
us!&quot; I explain yelling.  &quot;Not once when we have made love has she 
begged me to stop or burst into tears, nor have I done the same.&quot;
     
&quot;But you only &#39;made love&#39; once, why is that?&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s because...because...,&quot; again I am at a loss for words.
     
&quot;Perhaps she did not enjoy it, she was faking it.  I&#39;m sure she was 
thinking to herself the entire time that she wanted it to stop.&quot;
     
&quot;That&#39;s a lie!&quot; I retort.  &quot;Shion would never deceive me, whether it be
through or words or action!  I know she wouldn&#39;t, I just know it!&quot;
     
&quot;And what makes you so sure?&quot; she begins to approach me once more and 
soon her hand finds my shoulder.
     
&quot;I feel it...here,&quot; I say, bringing my palm above my left breast.
     
&quot;And just what is it that&#39;s there?&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s...&quot;
     
I can feel something beating, something pushing slowly beneath my skin 
as I press my hand against my chest.  Thump, thump, thump, the sound it
makes, it&#39;s exactly the same sound I hear when I rest my ear on her 
chest.  What is this instrument that continues to push above my
breast?
     
&quot;It&#39;s her heart,&quot; a third voice suddenly echoes in the air.
     
My head begins to swerve to the right and I find a slight illumination 
of gold standing before me.  My eyes narrow to try and shade the light 
as much as I can but it is to no avail.  Even bringing my hands before 
my vision does almost no good, but suddenly the light begins to dim and
a small figure begins to form where the light had originated.  The 
figure wears a pink dress that is nearly sleeveless, the only part of 
her arms that are covered are her shoulders.  I turn my attention
inward to the figure&#39;s neck, finding a gold cross hanging and fire-red 
strands of hair behind her neck.  My eyes then look upward a bit more, 
stopping before the figure&#39;s cerulean pupils.
     
&quot;Nephilim?&quot; I call the young girl&#39;s name.
     
&quot;It&#39;s you...,&quot; the cool demeanor of my sister begins to crack.
     
&quot;Miang, Elly, we meet again,&quot; the child speaks.
     
&quot;Don&#39;t give me that &#39;we meet again&#39; business!&quot; Miang bares her teeth.
     
&quot;Miang, stop this, please,&quot; the child begs, falling to her knees, 
&quot;can&#39;t you see that Elly has moved on, your attempt to become one again 
will...&quot;
     
&quot;I&#39;m tired of listening to you,&quot; Miang stomps, turning her back toward 
the girl in the process, &quot;I did that once and look at where it&#39;s gotten
me!&quot;
     
&quot;But Miang...,&quot; the child continues to plea.
     
&quot;Nothing but trouble, that&#39;s all you&#39;ve given me!&quot; I turn to Miang&#39;s 
hand which begins to glow with a dark violet light.
     
The next thing I know, my sister&#39;s arm rises and pushes toward the 
child in an instant.  The glow in her hand suddenly escapes her palm 
and the next thing I know, a loud crash echoes in my ears and smoke 
begins to fill my lungs and eyes.  I try to hack out the contents that 
had collected in my lungs within those few seconds but as soon as the 
dust clears, I find the young child and my sister hovering above my 
head.
     
&quot;Hmph, you&#39;ve grown weaker,&quot; my sister taunts returning to her stoic 
manner, &quot;normally you would&#39;ve been able to get out of a blast like 
that with little to no problems, but why is it that you couldn&#39;t evade 
an attack as simple as that.  If I had used a minuscule 2.9998% more of
my power, you would have been vaporized in an instant.&quot;
     
I turn to the child that hovers several feet in front of her.  A river 
of crimson runs down her left arm though most of it runs through the 
gaps between the fingers of her right hand which clutches the wound.  
The child&#39;s breath already seems heavy, her form slowly bobbing up and
down as she tries to regain the air she had lost from the blast.  Her 
knees are bending, it looks like they&#39;re barely able to support her 
weight and may collapse at any moment.  A golden glow then begins to 
shine in Nephilim&#39;s right palm, the light illuminating brighter and 
brighter with each second that passes.  The grin on plastered on 
Miang&#39;s face begins to melt at that moment and her body begins to arch 
preparing her for the worst.  The child then mimics the earlier action 
of my sister, her arm suddenly pushing toward her opponent and an 
illuminated beam escape her hand.  Again a cloud of smoke erupts upon 
impact, but this time when the smoke clears, only the child stands.  At
least for a mere second.  Miang then suddenly appears behind the child,
her body barely pressing against Nephilim&#39;s back.
     
&quot;Behind you!&quot; I try to warn the child.
     
&quot;What?!&quot;
     
&quot;Got you,&quot; my sibling smirks.
     
The back of Miang&#39;s hand meets with the child&#39;s face for a mere second 
with another stream of scarlet erupting in the process.  The geyser 
sprays for a mere second, following the motion of the child&#39;s body 
before it meets with the floor.  As soon as I see this, my eyes narrow
once more and I find my nails impaling into my palm as I ball my 
fingers into fists.  My teeth begin to grind and I prepare to lift 
myself into their current locale, yet for some reason, I remain on the
ground.  
     
&quot;What, why can&#39;t I...?&quot;
     
My normal functions still haven&#39;t returned, I am unable to jump off the
ground and bring myself to Nephilim and Miang&#39;s current level; the most
I can jump is a mere foot off the ground.  I try to jump once again, 
but just like the last time, I find myself only jumping a foot off the
surface.  I then bring my arm forward and straighten it, waiting for 
the R-CANNON to appear.  Nothing, the weapon does not appear as it 
normally would.  My weapons aren&#39;t working either, none of my usual 
functions are...
     
&quot;Argh!&quot; I look back to the sky to find my sister striking Nephilim once
more with her fist.
     
&quot;Nephilim!&quot; I cry the child&#39;s name.
     
The child tries to return to her original posture after the strike, but
her entire form arches inward as Miang lifts her knee upward, planting 
it in Nephilim&#39;s abdomen.  The torture doesn&#39;t end there however as 
Miang then lifts her right arm upward, her fingers curled and her 
knuckles meeting with Nephilim&#39;s chin after, knocking the child back 
up.  Another punch follows, this one with the left hand, striking at 
her ribs, and then quickly followed by several more.  The attack
continues after the punches, but I try to hide the vision and tears 
before my eyes by closing them.  It does no good, I can still hear the 
child screaming and Miang laughing.
     
&quot;Make it stop,&quot; I begin chanting, &quot;make it stop, make it stop.&quot;
     
&quot;Ugh!&quot; the child&#39;s pain flows into my ears once more, blocking out the 
sound of my voice.
     
&quot;Make it stop, make it stop, please make it stop,&quot; I begin to chant 
louder.
     
&quot;Ah ha ha ha ha!&quot; my sister&#39;s laugh echoes in my ears once more.
     
&quot;Please make it stop, please make it stop.&quot;
     
&quot;Ack!&quot; the next cry again pushes through my voice, this time 
accompanied with a small rain that falls onto my arm.
     
&quot;PLEASE MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!&quot;
     
My body begins to burn suddenly as an orange glow begins to engulf me.
This burning, this fire, it continues to grow with every tear that I 
shed.  I begin to wrap my arms around myself to try and cool the fire 
but to no avail, instead it continues to grow.  The burning, for some
reason, it does not hurt, but it soothes.  Regardless, I just want it 
to stop, everything, just make it stop.  Surging, I can feel something 
beginning to glow in my hands.
     
&quot;What?!&quot; I hear my sister&#39;s voice once more, this time without anymore 
cries from the child.
     
I tighten the closing of my eyes and my fingers begin to press on my 
arms.  My legs begin to inch toward each other and the burning 
intensifies.  Stop it, stop this sudden warmth, stop this fighting, 
just...
     
&quot;AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!&quot; I scream.
     
The warmth suddenly begins to leave my body and I feel a brush of 
energy leaving my form, as if it were coming from my upper back.  Large
gusts of wind follow the energy, blowing from my spine and suddenly 
branching upward, toward Miang.  A crack opens within the darkness 
before my vision and I find several rays of light aiming for Miang.  
Miang&#39;s mouth opens widely as the beams fly toward her and she tries to
step back, but before she can do anything, the rays engulf her, once 
again surrounding the area with clouds of gray.  The clouds begin to 
engulf the child, but instead of swallowing her like my sister, they 
cause her to lose her leverage in the air and she plummets toward the 
floor.
     
&quot;Nephilim!&quot; I cry again.
     
Without thinking, I begin to push my legs against the floor as hard as 
I can so that I may catch the child before she hits the ground.  Her 
form grows larger and larger with each step my feet take until she 
becomes large enough to fall into my arms.  My body is dragged to the 
floor the moment my arms wrap around her tiny body, but I am still able
to catch her before she could hit the ground.  I bring her body 
parallel to the ground and hold it at the same level as my abdomen so 
that I may observe a majority of her wounds.  Blood, lots of blood is 
tainted on her milk-hued skin and now tattered dress, I can barely even
see any pink in her clothing now.  I turn to her eyes which now lie 
shut and her head tilted toward the floor with her mouth slightly open.
Despite the condition she is in, she is breathing, but barely.
     
&quot;Nephilim, are you all right?!&quot; I quickly ask the child only to have 
her reply with silence.  &quot;Nephilim,&quot; I begin to shake her form lightly,
&quot;Nephilim!&quot;
     
&quot;E...Elly...?&quot; the child barely calls my name.
     
&quot;Lie still, I&#39;m going to administer a medica ether,&quot; I order the child.
    
My normal functions and weapons may not be working at the moment, but 
I&#39;m sure I can still use Ether to a certain degree.
     
&quot;La so le vu ve ta,&quot; I chant as I lay my palms a few inches above her 
body.
     
My palms grow warm once again, much like the rest of my body did when I
suddenly unleashed that attack back there.  My eyes then fix on the 
oozing red craters all over her body, each of them slowly shrinking 
with every second that passes.  The red substance that travels down her
body begins to grow less rapid but eventually the leaking comes to a 
halt when their sources become sealed.  My palms then move away from 
her body after but one hand can&#39;t help but stroke away several strands 
of hair that cover her once bloodied face.  A small bristle is blown 
onto the tips of my fingers as they sweep away the strands and I can&#39;t 
help but smile knowing the child will be all right thanks to what I 
did to save her.  
     
Wait a minute, what was it that I just did before I administered the 
ether?  Nephilim was in danger, and then all of a sudden my entire body
began to grow warm, particularly my upper back.  As soon as I opened my
eyes, I found several rays of light firing at Miang.  The way it was 
fired, it was similar to that time I absorbed the Gnosis.
     
&quot;I...I was wrong about you, Elly,&quot; the child&#39;s voice removes me from my
thoughts.
     
&quot;What?&quot;
     
&quot;You&#39;re not like your other half, no, your former half,&quot; Nephilim 
continues.
     
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; her words leave me baffled.
     
&quot;Charging!&quot; another voice suddenly enters my ears.
     
I quickly around to find my sister standing before us as battered and 
bruised as Nephilim was.  Miang&#39;s clothing is also tattered; the 
strands that cover her breasts are barely attached to her corset now, 
hanging together by a single thread.  String hangs from the wrist part 
of her left glove while the right is completely seared off.  For once I
can see one of her eyes as half of her goggles now lies on the floor.  
How narrow that single eye is, its crimson pupil almost as black as the
garb of Death itself.  Her teeth begin to bare toward us, I can 
practically hear them grinding against one another.  Her hands begin to
hover before her abdomen now and suddenly her fingers plunge themselves
into her stomach.  Eight petal-like devices begin to open as her 
fingers pull away several plates over her stomach with an electrical 
current flowing between each one.  A red sphere rests inside the center
of her now open abdomen and it begins to glow as a parasitic- looking 
device escapes from the lower back of her spine.
     
&quot;X-BUSTER?!&quot; I quickly recognize the attack she is about to use.
     
Before I could react, columns of light begin to escape her abdomen, 
each of them hailing toward Nephilim and I.  Out of reaction I wrap my 
arms around Nephilim&#39;s form and turn my back toward the incoming fire. 
I shield my vision once more as I wait for the impact, wait for each of
those beams to pierce through me just as they did with all those Gnosis
and enemy soldiers not too long ago.  The sound of the beams crashing 
onto some sort of surface erupt in my ears shortly after, but for some 
reason I don&#39;t feel the actual beams piercing through me.
     
&quot;Huh?&quot; I open my eyes and find the child still wrapped around my arms.
     
&quot;Luck,&quot; I look to my sibling who clenches her teeth.
     
&quot;Miang...?&quot; I begin to return to my feet but with one arm still wrapped
tightly around the girl standing next to me.
     
&quot;I think I understand now,&quot; a small grin falls upon my enemy&#39;s face.  
&quot;I should&#39;ve known you would&#39;ve pulled a stunt like that, Nephilim, are
you that desperate to survive?&quot;
     
&quot;Desperate to survive...?&quot; I turn to the child in my arms.
     
&quot;That&#39;s just something a parasite like you would do,&quot; my sister 
continues.  &quot;If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll let this little incident go for 
now, but don&#39;t think I&#39;ll let it go for long.&quot;
     
The entire area begins to flood with clouds after and the air grows 
thick, but I keep my hold around Nephilim as tight as ever.  
Eventually I can see nothing but white before my eyes, even if I put my
hand before my face I can barely see it.  Nephilim is still holding on 
to me luckily, I feel her arms tightening further around mine as the 
mist continues to grow thicker.  A few moments later, I find the fog 
settling and the air returning to normal.
     
&quot;Are you all right?&quot; I ask Nephilim afterward.
     
&quot;Yes, thank you, Elly,&quot; she responds.
     
&quot;What just happened back there?&quot; my thoughts begin to linger toward the
recent events.
     
&quot;Ether,&quot; the little girl holding my arm speaks.
     
&quot;What?&quot;
     
&quot;Infinite ether,&quot; she repeats herself.  &quot;Shion is the key.&quot;
     
&quot;&#39;Shion is the key.&#39;, wait a second, what do you mean?&quot; I find myself 
confused once again.
     
My body begins burn again afterward, but this warmth is much different 
from the one I just felt a moment ago.  Drops of liquid begins to 
drench my temple suddenly and my limbs begin to grow limp as my breath 
begins to grow thin.  My throat is again parched and the scenery begins
to blur.  Hot, it feels so hot...  The surface below my feet seems to 
give away suddenly and my knees then stop before the floor that never 
left my feet.  Even then my body begins to sink further into the floor,
as if an unknown force is pulling me down.  The next thing I know, I 
find my side lying against a new surface and my entire body growing 
limp.  Everything is so warm, like I&#39;m in some sort of furnace.
     
Light suddenly begins to engulf my shut eyes, awakening me from my 
slumber.  The sound of birds chirping also begins to fill my ears, 
their lullaby freeing me from my sleep.  My entire upper body pushes 
itself upward the moment my eyes fully open and I find myself drenched 
in sweat and my body heaving heavily.
     
&quot;Another dream?&quot; I ask myself between my pants.
     
These visions I&#39;ve been having these last few days, they&#39;re becoming 
more frequent and confusing than the last.  This recent one is no 
exception either, but this time I don&#39;t have a single clue what just 
happened.
     
Another note of the birds&#39; morning song enters my ear and I find my 
breathing beginning to slow down.  The beating against my chest also 
lowers its pace as it tries to move in sync with nature&#39;s symphony.  My
arm meets with my brow afterward, wiping away the cool liquid that it
had collected.  I then turn to the direction where I had swept away the
sweat, finding my darling Shion resting beside me.  My mind begins to 
clear more as I admire how the sun&#39;s glow reflects off her perfect skin
and I can&#39;t help but begin to relax.  My body begins to sink toward the
bed again as my arms wrap around her figure and my head falling unto 
her shoulder.  My nose nuzzles against her arm the moment it meets with
her skin, but it begins to travel down further.  I find it brushing 
against her breasts within a few moments as it looks for a region that 
is able to support my head.  My arm begins to travel upward, my fingers
slowly gliding down Shion&#39;s sleeve until they wrap around her hand.
     
&quot;Mm,&quot; my lips can&#39;t help but purr when I feel the warmth of her body.
     
Soon I find my body beginning to sit up again, but not with my own 
accord.  For a moment I begin to worry on why I am doing this, but then
I realize my body is moving with hers.  A hand then falls upon my brow 
and pushes several strands away only to return once more to caress my 
skin.  A small pluck then falls upon my forehead a second later just as
an arm wraps around my waist.
     
&quot;Elly,&quot; my lover&#39;s voice slowly calls into my ear, &quot;it&#39;s time to wake 
up now.&quot;
     
&quot;Just a bit longer,&quot; I&#39;m able to mutter as I try to find my spot on her
body once again.
     
&quot;Of course,&quot; she answers as she glides her hand through my hair again.
     
I find comfort once again as I lie one ear to my lover&#39;s heart.  Thump,
thump, thump, how each beat slowly pushes against my cheek, just the 
sound is enough to make me relax once more.  I feel so comfortable and 
safe lying here like this, something I haven&#39;t felt since I met my 
sister.  It wasn&#39;t until last night that Shion was able to make me 
smile again and her touch was as comforting as ever.  The two of us 
just laid here in her bed, holding one another in each other&#39;s arms as 
our cheeks and lips continue press against one another.  Not once did I
push away the hugs or kisses, they were all welcomed with the same 
gesture.  The entire time, she continued to rock me in her arms while 
humming our song.
     
&quot;Shion,&quot; the voice of her brother suddenly began to call from the other
side of the door.
     
&quot;Yes?&quot;
     
&quot;Breakfast!&quot; he calls.
     
&quot;Well this is a first,&quot; Shion says somewhat surprised.  &quot;All right, I&#39;m
coming down!&quot; she calls back.  &quot;Come on, Elly, let&#39;s go.&quot;
     
For once in my life I refuse to leave my spot, instead trying to burrow
myself further in bed.  
     
&#39;Not now,&#39; I think to myself, &#39;please not now...&#39;
     
Just the thought of moving out of this space now returns the images of 
my last dream of my head.  The taste of dust and smoke, the sight of 
blood, and the sound of my sister&#39;s taunts, they&#39;re already coming back
to me!  Just let me stay here a bit longer, long enough so that I can
forget about it.  
     
A small tap falls upon my shoulder, but I shrug it away and turn to the
side.  Another tap follows and again I move.  A small breath then flows
into my left ear, the air causing my body to stir.  I know I have to 
get up eventually and remember the horrid events, but lying here allows
me to forget for just a few seconds.  Please, Shion, don&#39;t wake me up, 
leave me here!  
     
Fingers then begin to slide down my arm and for some reason my lips 
begin to curl while trying to prevent a gust of air from escaping my 
lips.  They continue to glide once more, this time more join in and 
reach for my leg.  More air tries to escape and I find it harder and 
harder to keep it in with every inch the fingers touch.  Finally I open
my mouth and laughter begins to escape as my hands reach for those of 
my love trying to stop her from touching me.  It&#39;s not that the touch 
is unwelcome, I just want her to stop making me laugh.  My eyes are 
open now and I find my love in front of me laughing hysterically as she
continues to make me laugh with her touch.
     
&quot;You&#39;re very ticklish, aren&#39;t you, Elly?&quot; she asks between her 
laughter.
     
&quot;Shion, ah ha ha ha, stop it, please,&quot; I try to order between my own 
cries.
     
Her touch fills me with such joy, I can&#39;t help but begin to forget my 
dream again with Shion playing with me like this.  My own hands begin 
to fall onto her own body, following the same movements as hers.  Her 
laugh begins to echo over mine for a few moments but within a few 
strokes I find my voice once again balling over hers.  Both of our 
voices take turns echoing above the other, our faces growing redder and
redder with each chuckle and giggle that escapes our lips.  My breath 
begins to grow short again but I don&#39;t mind, each one is being used to 
try and echo above the use of hers.
     
&quot;Shion, just what are you doing up there?&quot; Jin&#39;s voice begins to call 
over our laughing.  &quot;Come on, it&#39;s time to eat!&quot;
     
&quot;All right, we&#39;re coming down,&quot; she calls to her brother with her 
remaining breath.  &quot;Well now that you&#39;re awake, we should go downstairs
now,&quot; she tells me with a huge smile stretched across her lips.
     
&quot;Okay,&quot; I nod, trying to regain my composure.
     
Shion allows me to go ahead of her as we leave the room.  She opens the
door for me and allows me to pass and as soon as I do, she closely 
follows.  A new aroma has filled the entire house since we cleaned it 
yesterday; it wasn&#39;t the smell of food, but it was something I can&#39;t 
really describe.  The closest thing that could describe it is that it 
smelled clean, not a scent of body perspiration or dust like yesterday.
The entire house is brighter as well, the ivory-colored walls shine 
enough that they almost make me squint.  We walk downstairs to find the
others already beginning their meal, each of them sitting at different 
parts of the living room and kitchen.  The Elsa&#39;s crew still occupies 
the table near the kitchen just as they did yesterday while the 
Durandal&#39;s captain and young realian sit on a couch in the living room.
The cyborg is the only one who isn&#39;t eating, instead he sits on a chair
with his eyes focused on the television as it plays the news.
     
&quot;Shion, there you are,&quot; her brother greets us as we enter the kitchen.
     
&quot;Good morning, Jin,&quot; she smiles, &quot;this isn&#39;t like you to make breakfast
you know.&quot;
     
&quot;I know, but you seemed really tired last night so I didn&#39;t want to 
wake you up,&quot; he tells her.
     
&quot;You said there was food,&quot; I interrupt the two, &quot;yet I don&#39;t smell 
anything.&quot;
     
&quot;Elly, don&#39;t be rude,&quot; my lover tells me as she lightly nudges my ribs 
with her elbow.
     
&quot;Miss KOS-MOS is pretty observant I see,&quot; a chuckle begins to escape 
Jin&#39;s lips.  &quot;It&#39;s not much but...&quot;
     
&quot;Cereal?&quot; Shion says somewhat disappointed as her brother pulls a box 
with a cartoon animal on the logo toward her.
     
&quot;Well it&#39;s been a while since I last went to the groceries and there 
isn&#39;t enough real food to feed all the guests you brought in 
yesterday,&quot; Jin tells her.
     
&quot;Did you even read the expiration date on this thing?!&quot; my lover 
suddenly begins to lose her temper.  &quot;This cereal expired two years 
ago, I even remember this exact box being here when I left!&quot;
     
&quot;Well excuuuuuuuse me, you&#39;re the only one who eats Sugar-Coated 
Chocolate O&#39;s!&quot; he retorts.
     
&quot;You should at least be responsible enough to throw it out when it 
expires!&quot; Shion yells.
     
&quot;Hey I&#39;m not the one who touches the stuff, do you know how unhealthy 
that is?&quot; Jin retorts.
     
&quot;That&#39;s not the point!&quot;
     
&quot;Stop it, both of you!&quot; I practically scream, bringing the two&#39;s 
arguing to a halt.  &quot;It&#39;s too early to be fighting, just throw away the
box and let&#39;s get something else to eat.&quot;
     
&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right, Elly,&quot; Shion begins to calm down.
     
&quot;You built a pretty good negotiator, Shion,&quot; Jin says as he brings the 
box to the garbage.
     
&quot;By the way, Jin, you didn&#39;t give that cereal to anyone, did you?&quot; 
Shion asks.
     
&quot;Only that guy with the &quot;Caution: I&#39;m a Boozer&quot; hat, everyone else got 
some of my shredded wheat cereal,&quot; Jin informs her.
     
&quot;Ugh, this is horrible!&quot; I hear the captain&#39;s complaints from the 
dining table.
     
&quot;Captain, we all know you enjoy it, so would stop pretending to 
complain already?&quot; Tony grumbles.
     
&quot;No really, this tastes bad!&quot; the captain defends his statement.  &quot;This
cereal tastes like it&#39;s been sitting in a corner for an entire year!&quot;
     
&#39;If he only knew the real truth,&#39; I thought to myself.
     
Breakfast consisted of the same shredded wheat cereal the others (minus
the Elsa&#39;s captain) had.  I couldn&#39;t help but notice that Shion was 
practically choking down each spoonful of cereal as she brought it into
her mouth.  I could understand the feeling, this particular dish tasted
rather bland and it was hard to swallow, it also made my throat itch a 
little.  I know cereal is normally eaten with milk poured over it, but 
there was none in the refrigerator.  For some reason drinking water 
afterward would return that horrible taste to my mouth but it did in 
turn wash away the itchiness in my throat.  After somehow managing to 
finish our meal, Shion and I soon found ourselves at the sink washing 
the bowls and glasses we and the others had used.  Shion was managing 
the soap while I simply rinsed the residue off the devices and placed 
them in the cupboards.
     
&quot;Well I should get going,&quot; I overhear Jin above the sound of the 
faucet.
     
&quot;Where are you going, Jin?&quot; Shion asks her brother.
     
&quot;I thought that I might as well go to town and get some groceries since
we have a lot of guests,&quot; Jin informs her.
     
&quot;Hey Jin, how about we give you lift into town,&quot; he silver-haired boy 
suddenly volunteers, &quot;it looks like it will take a while to get through
the woods.&quot;
     
&quot;Hey wait a minute,&quot; Matthews suddenly interrupts, &quot;the last time I 
checked, I was the captain of the Elsa!&quot;
     
&quot;Let it go, Matthews,&quot; Jr. sighs, &quot;he let us stay the night yesterday 
so the least you can do is help him get some groceries.&quot;
     
&quot;Actually maybe we should just get it ourselves seeing how...,&quot; the 
navigator tries to speak.
     
&quot;Shut up, ya moron,&quot; the Elsa&#39;s captain interrupts, &quot;don&#39;t give them 
any ideas!&quot;
     
&quot;That sounds like a good idea, Hammer,&quot; MOMO agrees, &quot;don&#39;t you think 
so, Jr.?&quot;
     
&quot;Yeah, that sounds a lot better,&quot; the U.R.T.V. agrees, &quot;why don&#39;t you 
guys go into town and get the groceries?  The Durandal will pay for it 
and we&#39;ll take whatever you buy off your debt, what do you say, it&#39;s a 
win-win situation don&#39;t you think?&quot;
     
&quot;I guess that sounds fair,&quot; Matthews says, &quot;all right, we&#39;ll do it.&quot;
     
&quot;And don&#39;t think you get off that easily, I&#39;ll have Jin make you a list
of what to buy, anything else will be coming out of your wallet,&quot; Jr. 
adds.
     
&quot;I guess he saw right through you, Captain,&quot; Hammer informs him.
     
&quot;Shut up ya moron, this is all your fault!&quot;
     
&quot;Looks like I&#39;ll be staying home after all,&quot; Jin breathes a sigh of 
relief.  &quot;Come to think of it, it&#39;s a nice day today.  Hey Shion, it&#39;s 
been a while since you&#39;ve been to the beach, right?  Why don&#39;t you and 
your friends go down there with me, I&#39;ll catch some dinner while we&#39;re 
at it.&quot;
     
&quot;That sounds great!&quot; Shion exclaims.
     
&quot;The beach?&quot; the location leaves me puzzled.  &quot;What&#39;s so special about 
it?&quot;
     
&quot;Oh, I forgot that I&#39;ve never brought you to one before,&quot; Shion 
remembers.  &quot;What makes it so special is... is...&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s just fun to go there with friends,&quot; the young realian finishes my
lover&#39;s words.
     
&quot;Why is that?&quot; I still can&#39;t comprehend the situation.
     
&quot;Because it is,&quot; MOMO repeats herself.
     
&quot;I still don&#39;t understand.&quot;
     
&quot;Elly, just think of it like being with me, you can&#39;t exactly describe 
that feeling in words,&quot; Shion answers.
     
&quot;I think I understand,&quot; I say, but the situation still leaves me 
puzzled.
     
&#39;I still don&#39;t get it,&#39; is what I thought to myself afterward.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The beach wasn&#39;t very far from the house, in fact, it was pretty much 
right below the cliff it sat on; we simply had to walk down a small 
path near the forest&#39;s entrance to get down to the beach.  The cyborg 
refused to go with us though, he said his parts would rust because of 
the sand and sea water.  I can understand the reasoning why the cyborg 
can&#39;t go, but what I don&#39;t understand is the reason why everyone chose 
to wear a certain attire for this occasion attire, they&#39;re all pretty 
much wearing undergarments (with the exception of Allen who wears 
something that looks like a pair of boxers attached to a sleeveless 
shirt with green stripes).  Luckily Shion didn&#39;t have me wear something
so revealing, she gave me a uniform similar to my usual attire just 
that it was a plain white shade and it reveals my belly.  She wouldn&#39;t 
let me wear my boots with this uniform though, she said it was 
inappropriate and instead gave me what seem to be shoe soles with a 
strap that goes between my big toe and the one next to it.  I think she
called them &quot;flip-flops.&quot;
     
&quot;Well, we&#39;re here,&quot; Jin announces as soon as we arrive.
     
I still don&#39;t see what&#39;s so special about this place, all I see are 
rocks, sand, and the ocean.  The breeze is rather gentle and cool 
though and it carries a small aroma of salt and water.  I look toward 
the sky and find nothing but a perfect blank blue, not a cloud in the 
sky.  A small squawking sound enters my ear a second later and I turn 
to the source to find several gulls flying over the ocean.  I think I&#39;m
beginning to see why MOMO enjoys the beach now, just the very image of 
the sand alone is dull, but the combination of the wind, birds, and 
smell of the ocean makes it a fascinating experience.
     
&quot;This looks like a nice spot,&quot; I turn to the young U.R.T.V. who plants 
a parasol into the sand as well as a towel.
     
&quot;Elly, are you thirsty?&quot; I turn to my lover who places a cooler next to
us.
     
My face begins to burn the moment my eyes meet with her form.  This 
uniform she&#39;s wearing, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen her wear it and 
for some reason, it&#39;s making me feel rather warm.  It&#39;s basic form 
looks like a normal set of lingerie, but instead of being only white or
black, it&#39;s a mixture of the two.  The edges of the top are colored 
darkly, as are the straps that hold it and the centerpiece that holds 
the two cups together.  It&#39;s nearly the same for the bottom piece, just
that center is white while everything else is black.  I can see her 
figure perfectly, just as I did when we professed our love physically, 
but the sensitive parts are shielded from my view via the bra and 
underwear.  My mouth suddenly begins to fill with a substance similar 
to the sweat now dripping down my forehead.  I gulp the contents down 
my throat but all it does is make the fire in my face burn brighter.
     
&quot;Elly, are you okay?&quot; my lover&#39;s voice breaks me out of my standstill.
     
&quot;I..., uh, I&#39;m okay,&quot; I answer with a slight hesitation.
     
&quot;The heat must already be exhausting you, here, have some water,&quot; she 
hands me a liter of the liquid from the cooler.
     
I take the contents into my mouth quickly and parch the fire within a 
few sips.  As soon as I return the cap to the bottle, I suddenly feel a
very light touch falling upon the side of my head.  I turn to the 
source to find a round, multi-colored sphere falling slowly to the floor.
     
&quot;Heads up!&quot; the Durandal&#39;s captain yells a moment too late as I stare 
at the device.
     
&quot;KOS-MOS, can you return the ball please?&quot; MOMO calls.
     
I take the sphere into my free hand for a moment and quickly pull it 
off the ground, along with a few grains of sand that stick to it.  Odd,
it&#39;s extremely light, I thought it would be a bit heavier than this.  
No matter, I simply return the ball with a small throw that has it land
in the young realian&#39;s hand.  She returns the gesture with a smile and 
then throws the ball into the air once again and taps it before it 
lands so that it could go to Jr.&#39;s hands.
     
&quot;Whoa, I got something!&quot; I turn to the west to find Jin holding some 
sort of bending pole that causes him to move forward.
     
&quot;Oh brother, there he goes again,&quot; I turn to Shion as she sighs.  
&quot;Elly, can you watch our stuff while I help Jin?&quot;
     
&quot;Someone help me!&quot; I hear Jin cry after as his sister rushes to his 
aid.
     
I can&#39;t help but smile at the image of Jin struggling to pull the pole 
back and I can&#39;t help but laugh as Shion tries to help him but to no 
avail.  The two begin slip forward after a few moments with their 
struggle, both of them falling face first into the sand.  Again I can&#39;t
help but laugh, this time even harder as the pole begins to move toward
the ocean as it slips out of Jin&#39;s hands.  Jin quickly returns to his 
feet and chases after the device with Shion close behind him and they 
manage to catch up with it and begin to pull once again.
     
&quot;This would be a perfect time,&quot; my sister&#39;s voice suddenly whispers in 
my ear.
     
&quot;Uh...?!&quot; my right arm begins to twitch.
     
Slowly it begins to rise on its own accord and begins to pull the rest 
of my body toward Shion and Jin.  I notice that it is only my right 
arm that isn&#39;t moving on my own accord, so I quickly wrap my left hand 
around its wrist and force all my strength to push it down.  The arm is
gradually brought to my side but it continues to tremble as it tries to
fight against the force of my other arm.  My left arm doesn&#39;t seem to 
be enough to keep my right arm from stopping so I then try to press it 
against the ground with my right leg.
     
&quot;You can&#39;t keep doing this,&quot; my sister&#39;s icy voice whispers again.
     
&quot;What are you doing to me?!&quot; my words say, barely escaping the gaps of 
my teeth.
     
&quot;You and I are one, need I remind you again?&quot; she reminds me.
     
&quot;Not here,&quot; I try to convince her, &quot;not when they&#39;re all...&quot;
     
&quot;This is the perfect opportunity, none of them would suspect a thing,&quot; 
Miang interrupts.
     
&quot;I don&#39;t...&quot;
     
&quot;KOS-MOS!&quot; I look up to find the young realian running toward me.
     
The twitching and sudden movements of my arm come to a halt at that 
moment.  I can move it again at my own accord, but despite that, I 
continue to sit on the back of it&#39;s palm to ensure that my sister 
doesn&#39;t take control again suddenly.  I look back up to find MOMO 
standing in front of me with her body bending forward and her eyes 
looking into mine.
     
&quot;Yes?&quot; I act as if nothing had just happened.
     
&quot;Come on, KOS-MOS, play with us!&quot; the child takes hold of my left hand 
and tries to drag me toward the beach.
     
&quot;I&#39;d rather not,&quot; I tell her as I divert my eyes to the ground.
     
&quot;Please, just for...,&quot; she reaches for my other hand.
     
&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; I order her, quickly turning my back toward her in the 
process.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t feel like playing at the moment,&quot; I 
lie to the child.
     
&quot;Are you worried the ball&#39;s going to hit you again?&quot; MOMO asks as she 
takes a seat beside me.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s only made of plastic and 
air, it won&#39;t...&quot;
     
&quot;That&#39;s not it!&quot; I quickly cut her off.  &quot;I just...&quot;
     
&quot;MOMO, can you leave me alone with her for a moment?&quot; I turn around the
moment I hear Shion&#39;s voice.
     
&quot;Okay,&quot; she simply nods and goes on her way.
     
&quot;Elly, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; my love asks me.  &quot;You&#39;ve been acting 
strangely these past few days, and I&#39;m not just talking about the fact 
that you&#39;ve become more emotional.  The sudden outbursts, the mood 
swings...&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s just...,&quot; I try to explain.
     
&quot;It&#39;s Miang, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Shion asks.  &quot;If only I had been able to...&quot;
her words begin to trail off.
     
&quot;Shion?&quot;
     
&quot;I haven&#39;t been totally honest with you, Elly,&quot; my lover admits, her 
head starting to hang low.  &quot;It&#39;s my fault that Miang still exists 
inside of you.&quot;
     
&quot;Your fault, how can that be?&quot; I ask.
     
&quot;I told you that I did your programming after we used your sister&#39;s 
parts to create you, right?&quot; she reminds me.  &quot;Well the truth is that 
the programming in your memory storage could not be totally erased, 
there was one black box area in particular that we couldn&#39;t reprogram.&quot;
     
&quot;Black box?&quot;
     
&quot;I don&#39;t know what was programmed in there,&quot; Shion admits, &quot;Kevin was 
responsible for a majority of Miang&#39;s programming, but now I think I 
now what was in there; Miang&#39;s memories and emotions.  There may have 
been a system error in your OS after you jumped off the Elsa which 
allowed some of those memories to slowly sink into your own.&quot;
     
&quot;If that&#39;s true, then her emotions may...&quot;
     
&quot;Elly, you love me, don&#39;t you?&quot; my lover suddenly asks me.
     
&quot;Of course I love you,&quot; I answer.
     
&quot;Then there is no way her emotions can become your own,&quot; Shion tells me
as her arms wrap around my waist.  &quot;Your sister hates me and I can&#39;t 
blame her,&quot; my love continues as I bring my head to her shoulder, 
&quot;after all, I was the one who...&quot;
     
&quot;She was blinded by her jealousy,&quot; I assure her, &quot;if she hadn&#39;t fallen 
for Kevin, I&#39;m sure...&quot;
     
&quot;I never spent time with Miang,&quot; Shion interrupts me, &quot;it was always 
Kevin who shared his time with her, I was only there to help with her 
programming.  Not once did I go into the Encephalon and greet her, not 
once did I help her with her lessons to become emotional, and even if 
she didn&#39;t fall for Kevin, she would still resent me for never spending
time with her.  Miang, I was always so negligent of her, both the doll 
and your sister,&quot; my lover&#39;s voice begins to crack, &quot;and destroying her
two years ago is another sin I had imparted on her!&quot;
     
Streams began to fall down my lover&#39;s cheek rapidly after accompanied 
by several small gasps and hiccups which resulted from her sobbing.  
Her entire body begins to sink toward the ground now, but I am able to 
catch her fall by leaning my body in closer to hers.  The wrap she has 
around my waist begins to grow tighter and her face then falls onto my 
shoulder.  It is my turn to comfort her, and I begin by brushing 
several strands of hair away from her tear-ridden face.
     
&quot;Shion...I...,&quot; no words of comfort can come to mind.
     
&quot;No mother should ever have to bury her own child,&quot; my love&#39;s sobbing 
continues, &quot;nor must she send her to the grave.  If only I had been 
there for her...&quot;
     
&quot;Shion, it&#39;s not entirely your fault,&quot; I try to assure her, &quot;I&#39;m sure 
you were so busy with work that...&quot;
     
&quot;Chief, are you okay?&quot; I turn my attention upward to find Allen, Jin, 
MOMO, and Jr.
     
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m just not feeling well today,&quot; she answers, wiping away 
the streams traveling down her face.
     
&quot;Perhaps going to the beach wasn&#39;t a very good idea,&quot; Jin says as he 
wraps his fingers around his chin.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I never should have 
imposed the idea.&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s not your fault, Jin,&quot; my lover assures him, &quot;I actually thought 
it would help me unwind after everything that happened lately, but...&quot;
     
&quot;Do you wanna go home then?&quot; Jr. asks.  &quot;We can always come back when 
you&#39;re feeling better.&quot;
     
&quot;No, it&#39;s all right, I just...just want to be left alone for a while, 
that&#39;s all,&quot; Shion tells them.
     
&quot;It&#39;s not any fun if any one of us is depressed,&quot; MOMO pouts.
     
&quot;I thank you for your concern, but...&quot;
     
&quot;Shion, perhaps it is best that we should all just return to the 
house,&quot; I interrupt, &quot;the others seem rather insistent.&quot;
     
&quot;...yeah, I guess you&#39;re right.&quot;
     
We returned to the house shortly afterward; Shion was always in the 
back of the line during our return trip.  Naturally I stayed in the 
back with her, but not once during the entire time did she say a word 
or move her vision away from the floor.  Each of her steps were slow 
and wobbly, there was not a single moment when I worried about her 
tripping.  I was always ready to catch her if she were every to fall, 
but luckily that never happened.  Even when we finally went inside she 
was still having trouble focusing.  The others stayed in the living 
room as I walked Shion up to her room while she preoccupied with her 
own thoughts.  The moment we arrived in her room, she immediately sat 
on her bed with her eyes still lingering toward the floor.  Knowing 
that she no longer needs assistance at this point, I begin to show my 
way out.
     
&quot;Elly,&quot; my lover stops me with the call of my name.
     
&quot;Yes?&quot;
     
&quot;Come here,&quot; she orders, patting the space next to her.
     
I follow her request without question, much like I always do whenever 
she asks something of me.  I take a seat beside my love, sitting a 
hand&#39;s space away from her.  Not a word escapes her lips as she 
continues to stare at the floor, her legs lifting themselves up for a 
moment every few seconds.  I continue to watch her as she continue to 
observe the ground, but it does not look like she has the courage to 
speak.  I turn away from her for one moment and finally a sentence 
escapes her lips.
     
&quot;Elly, if things were different, if Miang hadn&#39;t gone berserk and she 
still existed and you existed as well, but in a different body than 
hers, would you still love me?&quot; my lover asks.
     
&quot;Would I...?  Shion, you needn&#39;t ask me such...&quot;
     
&quot;Even if I hadn&#39;t paid attention to you or spent any quality time with 
you much like I did with your sister, would you still love me?&quot; she 
continues.
     
&quot;Shion, I...,&quot; I begin to ponder on her question.  &quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure I 
would,&quot; I answer after a moment of thought.  &quot;I&#39;m sure that deep down 
inside, Miang loves you too, despite the fact you never spent quality 
time with her.  She may despise you for having Kevin chosen you over 
her, but I believe she is still grateful to you for programming her.&quot;
     
What am I saying, I don&#39;t know any of this, I don&#39;t know how Miang 
really feels.  She hates Shion, I definitely know that, but I don&#39;t 
know if she cares for her deep in her heart.  Why did I say this?  Was 
it because I just wanted Shion to feel better, or...
     
&quot;Thank you for trying to make me feel better, Elly,&quot; Shion sniffs, &quot;but
I&#39;m afraid that your sister really doesn&#39;t care if I helped with her 
programming.&quot;
     
&quot;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t be of much help,&quot; I apologize.
     
&quot;But you are helping me, Elly,&quot; she assures me, bringing her hand on 
top of mine, &quot;I just want you to be here with me.&quot;
     
&quot;Shion, you may be happy with me being with you for now, but...,&quot; my 
thoughts linger back to what just happened at the beach, &quot;but Miang may
awaken within me again at any moment, just as she did on the Elsa two 
days ago.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s best if...&quot;
     
&quot;Elly, even if Miang were to awaken at this moment, I&#39;ll be happy 
knowing that my last moments of life were with you,&quot; she smiles.
     
&quot;Shion...&quot;
     
I can feel my lips beginning to quiver at that moment and my body 
beginning to draw toward my lover.  Her own mouth begins to push 
forward and her emerald eyes shut just as my vision begins to slowly 
fade.  I feel her own lips catching mine shortly after, the substance 
within her mouth slowly flooding into my own.  Her mouth tries to climb
atop of mine but they continue to fall as my lips continue to pulls 
hers down.  Again and again they bicker, exchanging blows with the 
devices within as they fight over the ambrosia that lurks inside.  
Fingers begin to slowly run through my hair as a palm begins to run 
down my neck.  My breath begins to fall short as the nails on that palm
begin to glide down the side of my throat, making my lips part from 
hers.
     
My breath quickly leaves my lungs as it indulges in her touch, and I 
have little time to recollect it as her mouth now begins to follow the 
same path as the nails.  Slowly they travel down the skin of my neck, 
sucking with every inch they travel down.  A tiny gasp escapes my lips 
with every pull of her mouth and once again my body entire body begins 
to burn.  The fire crawls upward with every second that passes, 
traveling further upward as her lips sink lower.  The sucking comes to 
a stop before my collar, instead being replaced with the lapping of my 
lover&#39;s tongue.  More gasps escape my mouth with every new layer that 
is placed below my neck, these one more tiny and quick than the ones 
that preceded them.  
     
The other hand that was running through my hair now leaves its spot 
only to travel downward like its companion but traveling more rapidly.
It comes to a stop within a second, its palm cupping one of the mounds 
on my chest.  It begins to push upward after, and I can&#39;t help but
nearly faint at its touch.  The hand continues to push my breast 
upward, moving it to the left as well.  The hand does not stop when the
mound can go no higher, instead it is pushed downward and toward the 
right, rotating it in a counter-clockwise fashion.  I can feel the nubs
on my breasts beginning to swell at that moment, how hard they try to 
pierce through the material of my clothing.
     
Shion notices this too and her tongue&#39;s lapping comes to a halt at that
moment, her mouth then turning to one of the straps of my clothing.  
Her free hand takes the other strap into its fingers just as her mouth 
takes hold with her teeth.  Without wasting any time, they pull 
downward, the air stinging my entire body the moment the material 
leaves my skin.  Shion&#39;s head begins to move inward after, her tongue 
once again leading the way, its tip barely dabbing against the surface 
of my skin.  I can feel the warmth of the ambrosia growing warmer and 
warmer as it travels toward my heart, as it slowly travels the side of 
my breast.  Finally it reaches the peak, my breath as short as ever.  
     
No more, my body tells me, but the fire in my heart continues to beg 
for more.  Another dab meets with the tip of my nipple, and again all 
of my breath escapes my lips.  The device slides upward, rolling my 
nipple in its direction.  The warmth of her tongue frees itself from 
the nub after, allowing it to bend back to its original position.  
Another brush follows a second later, once again trying to fold it in 
the same direction.  Again and again it laps over it, making it swell 
more and more with every time the device slides over it.  Finally the 
licking comes to a stop, but that doesn&#39;t mean my lover&#39;s tongue has 
left my breast.  Slowly the tip of the slippery device begins to circle
the peak, painting its base with its translucent honey.  I can hardly 
breath now, I almost feel like I&#39;m going to suffocate.  Regardless, I 
want more.  The laps come to a halt shortly after, giving me a moment 
to regain my breath, but once again I lose all of it in a second.  Her 
entire tongue now rests atop my nipple, but it no longer slides on it, 
instead her entire mouth dives in and begins to pull.  How soothing her
mouth feels as it slowly plucks against my skin, but doing it so 
delicately and slowly.  The sucking is slow, each one indulging every 
inch the nub has to offer.  The skin surrounding my breast&#39;s peak 
compresses momentarily with the pull of my lover&#39;s mouth, but within 
seconds it returns to its original state.  Each squeeze of her mouth 
hardens my nipple further, I can practically feel it ready to pierce 
her very mouth itself.  Shion&#39;s mouth then begins to slip away at that 
moment, but her lips stop before the beginning of the peak and they
continue to suckle.  I can hear my pants growing louder now, and the 
fire within me is burning as bright as ever.  I can no longer carry 
more any more breath into my lungs, I can only expel more and more.
     
&quot;Elly,&quot; my lover gives me a moment to regain my breath, &quot;I love you.&quot;
     
&quot;I love you too, Shion,&quot; I tell her between my breathing.
     
Her mouth returns to its previous duty shortly after, but her left hand
moves to another.  The tip of its fingers slowly slide down my abdomen,
pulling my uniform down with it.  I&#39;m helpless to stop it from falling 
further, I&#39;m too indulged in the soothing touch of her mouth.  The air 
slowly breathes onto my skin with every inch that becomes exposed until
I feel it touching my entire body.  I barely hear my uniform fall to 
the floor above my gasps, but it is not long enough to distract me from
my lover&#39;s touch.  With my body now free of clothing, my lover&#39;s hand 
begins to travel upward using my inner thigh.  My attention then begins
to linger away from her touch, and my entire body begins to relax.
     
&#39;Something isn&#39;t right,&#39; I think to myself.
     
My entire body grows numb at this moment, except for my inner thigh.  I
can still feel her fingers slowly climbing upward, but it slowly 
becomes apparent what their destination is.  My knees begin to push 
inward and my eyes begin to shut tighter than ever.  Regardless of my 
how I try to block her fingers, they continue to crawl upward.  The 
touch begins to remind me of my sister, how she plunged her fingers so 
fiercely into me.  How sharp her nails were when they crawled inside 
me, how quickly she jabbed them into my sex.  Another inch passes my 
lover&#39;s fingers and I tighten my legs further.  She ignores my action, 
pulling them away at the knees with her hands so that she may free my 
sex of any obstacles.  Her mouth leaves my breast at this moment, now 
traveling toward the open space.  I am reminded even more of my 
sister&#39;s action, I can practically feel her fingers once more stabbing 
into my sex.
     
&quot;No,&quot; the words barely escape me lips, &quot;no...&quot;
     
She does not hear my pleads, instead continuing downward.  My entire 
body begins to toss and turn at this moment, but Shion does not seem to
realize it.  I can feel her breath before my sex now, and I try to 
block it once again.  Her arms are too strong for me and I feel drops 
of her saliva dripping closer and closer.  The pain from my sister&#39;s 
attack intensifies further and further, enough until it becomes 
unbearable.
     
&quot;No!&quot;
     
At that moment my legs are able to break the hold of my lover and in 
the same instant push her away.  My entire body rises from the bed 
after, sweat drenching down my brow and onto the rest of my body.  My 
arms and legs quickly wrap around my private areas afterward as I try 
to regain my breath.  The memory and pain of my sister&#39;s attack begins 
to subside now, but the pain of the present slowly begins to come mind.
     
&quot;Shion?&quot; I look to the other side of the room to find her lying on the 
floor.
     
&quot;Elly,&quot; my lover responds weakly.
     
&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; I quickly rush to her aid, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;
     
&quot;No, I should be the one to apologize,&quot; she tells me as I return her to
her feet, &quot;I was so upset that...&quot;
     
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I apologize again.  &quot;Regardless, I shouldn&#39;t have pushed 
you away like that.&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s okay, I understand why you did what you did,&quot; she assures me.  
&quot;You&#39;re not ready for this sort of thing yet, so ahead and get 
dressed,&quot; she orders me, &quot;we&#39;ll make love again when you&#39;re ready.&quot;
     
&quot;But Shion...&quot;
     
&quot;It&#39;s not fair if it&#39;s only comfortable for one of us,&quot; she tells me.  

&quot;What Miang did to you, it wasn&#39;t your fault, Elly,&quot; she assures me.  

&quot;I know that event will prevent you from doing something like this for 
a period of time and I can understand that.  Elly, I can&#39;t enjoy making
love to you if I&#39;m the only one receiving joy from it, that&#39;s not how 
it works.  I know that the words &#39;make love&#39; are synonyms for sex, but 
the truth is, there is something more to that definition.  Making love 
is supposed to be the act of conveying two people&#39;s feelings for each 
other physically as opposed to sex which is merely the act of trying to
reproduce.  Do you understand, Elly?  I can&#39;t make love to you if 
you&#39;re not comfortable conveying your feelings through action.&quot;
     
&quot;I understand, but I...&quot;
     
&quot;We&#39;re back,&quot; I hear the silver-haired boy&#39;s voice coming from 
downstairs.
     
&quot;Elly, I&#39;m going to go help put away the groceries,&quot; my lover tells me,
&quot;are you going to be okay?&quot;
     
&quot;...I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; I tell her, &quot;I...&quot;
     
&quot;Are you sure,&quot; she asks me, &quot;if you still feel upset, then I don&#39;t 
mind talking with you further.&quot;
     
&quot;No, I&#39;ll be okay,&quot; I tell her.
     
&quot;All right, but don&#39;t continue blaming yourself for what happened, 
okay?&quot; Shion tells me before she leaves.
     
I don&#39;t want to burden Shion further with my problems, I&#39;ve troubled 
her enough with everything that&#39;s happened so far.  It hurts though 
keeping all this pain inside, and I&#39;d like to share it, but I just 
can&#39;t.  I admit that admitting my problems to chaos and MOMO in the 
past did remedy the pain a bit, but what I&#39;m feeling now, I don&#39;t think
I can share it, not with Miang ready to take over at any time.  I have 
to continue to bear it by myself.  Tomorrow, maybe I can head to 
Vector&#39;s Second R&amp;D Division tomorrow while the others are still 
asleep, they may think of something...  No, it&#39;s too risky, Miang may 
take over when I arrive in the city and even more trouble will be 
stirred.  I can&#39;t stay here, but I can&#39;t go out either, just what am I 
supposed to do?  Don&#39;t think about it now, Elly, there&#39;s nothing that 
can be done at the moment that can guarantee everyone&#39;s safety...
     
The rest of the day went by rather slowly, we mostly spent our time 
watching television.  I didn&#39;t really pay attention to the programs on 
the monitor, I was instead focused on Shion&#39;s words.  
     
&quot;Making love is supposed to be the act of conveying two people&#39;s 
feelings for each other physically,&quot; I recall my lover&#39;s words.
     
&quot;...it&#39;s all the same, it&#39;s sex,&quot; Miang&#39;s words echo in my ear after.
     
&quot;What we do is something different!&quot; I remember my reaction.
     
&#39;It is different,&#39; I think to myself after remembering.
     
Rape, making love, sex, all of them do have the same goals as Miang 
said; it&#39;s to pass one genes on to the next generation.  She went on to
say that there is also no greater joy than that, but what about Shion 
and me?  We made love once, and it made us both feel happy, but I never
thought about it until now, what was that joy that the two of us felt 
when it happened?  The joy of passing on our genes, no, that couldn&#39;t 
be it.  It&#39;s impossible for two women to pass their genes on to the 
next generation if they had sex with each other, and even more so when 
one of those women is an android.  Android, am I even an android 
anymore?  What happened to me these last two days, I haven&#39;t been 
feeling like myself, this warmth, this hunger, these things I never 
felt before I leapt off the Elsa.  Is this what being a human is like?
     
&quot;We are dolls, Elly,&quot; more of my sister&#39;s words come to mind.  &quot;You and
I are the same, manifestations of one&#39;s desire, to look and act human, 
but in reality we are nothing more than toys for the ones that created 
us.&quot;
     
&quot;You are Elly, the woman I love,&quot; more of Shion&#39;s words come to mind, 
&quot;you are no more, no less than that.&quot;
     
&quot;This is just too confusing!&quot; I find myself striking against the arm of
the couch.
     
&quot;What&#39;s too confusing?&quot; I look to the side to find the young realian 
with a puzzled expression on her face.
     
&quot;...it&#39;s nothing,&quot; I turn back to the monitor in front of the room, &quot;I 
just...need some time to think.&quot;
     
Without giving any more thought, I decide to head outside.  The noise 
of the conversations and TV have become to loud for me to concentrate.
The evening breeze greets me when I open the door, sending a small 
chill down my skin.  I never thought my normal clothing would be this 
unfit for the weather, I suppose I could borrow more clothing from 
Shion next time.  The stars, I&#39;ve never looked at them this much until 
now, they&#39;ve become my new sanctuary.  I breath in a sigh and find a 
place to sit on the ground, bringing my arms around my knees as I 
return to my thoughts.
     
&quot;What are you doing out here?&quot; a voice enters my ear.
     
It is the voice of chaos, the mysterious silver-haired boy.  I take a 
moment to turn around to greet him, but I quickly return my vision 
toward the sky.  I hear him coming closer until I can see his figure 
through the edge of my eye and then he begins to speak.
     
&quot;In the early days of history, Man would always look into the stars for
answers,&quot; the boy speaks as he takes a seat beside me. &quot;Staring into 
the endless abyss would put his mind at rest, allowing imagination and 
thought to sink into him.  Is that what you are doing now?&quot;
     
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nod.
     
&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;
     
Silence is the answer I give him, I can&#39;t think of anyway to explain 
the situation to him.
     
&quot;Each of us has many selves,&quot; he speaks again, &quot;at times we can be 
someone&#39;s friend, and others, we can be a parent&#39;s child, regardless of
these different selves, they all share the same memories, the same 
identity.  Each of these selves can each be described as our true self,
but you, your case is different...,&quot; his words begin to intrigue me.  
&quot;There is a self within you that really isn&#39;t you; you share the same 
memories and experiences, yet your identities are not one.  Who is this
other self within you, KOS-MOS, can she really be called your past self
or other half, or is she the remains of a memory long forgotten?&quot;
     
How does he know about Miang, surely Shion didn&#39;t tell him.  No, he 
must&#39;ve been aware that Miang has existed in me this whole time, why 
else did Miang not attack him like she did the others back on the Elsa?
Why does he know all this though?
     
&quot;chaos, how...?&quot;
     
&quot;Elly,&quot; my lover&#39;s voice interrupts before I could ask.  &quot;There you 
are,&quot; I turn around to find my lover walking toward us.
     
&quot;I think I&#39;ll go back inside now,&quot; the boy tells me.
     
&quot;Oh no, you don&#39;t have to go,&quot; Shion assures him, &quot;I was just looking 
for her.&quot;
     
&quot;No, I really should get going,&quot; chaos tells her, &quot;knowing your 
brother, he might accidentally burn down the whole kitchen while 
cooking dinner.&quot;
     
&quot;&#39;Knowing your brother,&#39;&quot; Shion says puzzled as the boy leaves, &quot;why 
does he say it like he&#39;s met Jin before?&quot;
     
&quot;Is something the matter, Shion?&quot; I ask her.
     
&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing,&quot; Shion dismisses the thought, &quot;but how about you, 
are you feeling okay?&quot;
     
&quot;I&#39;m a little cold,&quot; I admit, bringing my arms to my shoulders.
     
&quot;Here,&quot; she wraps her uniform jacket around my body, &quot;is that better?&quot;
     
&quot;A little,&quot; I tell her.
     
Silence follows soon after, not another word leaves our mouths.  
Speechless, I don&#39;t intend to be right now, but I can think of nothing 
to say, all I can really think of are many words that had been spoken 
between, Shion, Miang, and myself these past few days.  I hear all 
three voices chattering at the same time, each of them saying something
different on the same subject.  Every word feels like its gnawing away 
a piece of my brain, I just don&#39;t know which voice to believe.
     
The voices come to halt suddenly with the touch of one&#39;s hand.  My body
begins to sink to the west as the arm pulls me closer to its owner.  
Another arm wraps around my waist and I find a chin resting atop of my 
head now.  My thoughts become clear again, but I still can&#39;t think of 
any words to say to my love.
     
&quot;Is this better?&quot; she asks me.
     
&quot;Yes,&quot; I nod.
     
&quot;I used to go out here a lot when I was younger too,&quot; Shion tells me.  
&quot;After Jin and I moved here, I would always think about my parents, but
I never said anything to my brother, instead I would come out here and 
think of them.  Jin and I weren&#39;t very close when we first came here, 
maybe it was because he was thirteen years older than me and we didn&#39;t 
really have much in common.  I remember one night though, it was about 
ten years ago, I snuck out of the house and came here, I thought Jin 
was asleep.  I was thinking about my parents and the time we spent
together, I couldn&#39;t help but cry remembering about them.  That&#39;s when 
Jin came outside, he asked me, &#39;why are you crying, Shion?&#39;.  I didn&#39;t 
answer him, and then he asked, &#39;it&#39;s about Mom and Dad, isn&#39;t it?&#39;  He 
took a seat next to me after and then he wrapped me around his arms,
much like I am with you now.  &#39;You&#39;re not the only one who misses 
them,&#39; he told me, &#39;you&#39;re not the only one who cries.&#39;  That was the 
first time I ever saw my brother cry, it was probably the first step we
took to growing close to each other.&quot;
     
&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re close,&quot; I ask her, &quot;you two are always fighting.&quot;
     
&quot;Oh that,&quot; she tells me after a slight chuckle, &quot;it&#39;s not like we mean 
each other harm or anything, it&#39;s just the clashing of our views, 
nothing else.  Besides, we always look back at our arguments later and 
laugh about how stupid we were acting.&quot;
     
&quot;I see.&quot;
     
&quot;But Elly, the point I&#39;m trying to make here is that we all need to 
share our pain with others, no matter how much it hurts,&quot; Shion 
continues.  &quot;I know you were trying to save me and the others from 
further attacks when you jumped off the Elsa, but you also have to 
consider the pain others will go through for your own actions.&quot;
     
&quot;Shion, I know that, but...,&quot; I feel my eyes beginning to water.
     
&quot;You&#39;re not comfortable talking about it yet, right?&quot; she finishes my 
words.  &quot;It&#39;s okay, something like this isn&#39;t what you&#39;d want to 
discuss if it just happened recently.  When you&#39;re
ready to talk though, remember that I&#39;ll always be here.&quot;
     
&quot;I know, Shion, I know...,&quot; I barely whisper.
     
The air begins to grow heavy now, the evening breeze has grown colder.
My skin begins to shiver now, I can feel it tightening.  Not a feeling 
of warmth, my entire body begins to grow numb.  Shion is feeling this 
too, I can feel her hold around me tightening.  The atmosphere begins
to thaw now, I can feel warmth beginning to enter my body.  It grows 
warmer and warmer, it&#39;s starting to burn.  I look back to Shion, she 
still holds me as if she were cold.  I now realize what is happening, I
have to do something before it&#39;s too late.
     
&quot;Shion, it&#39;s Miang!&quot; I try to warn her, but no words escape my lips.
     
&quot;Elly, it&#39;s getting rather cold now,&quot; Shion tells me, unaware of 
Miang&#39;s presence, &quot;maybe we should head back inside.&quot;
     
&quot;All right,&quot; Miang speaks through my voice.
     
Her hold begins to pull away from me soon after and she begins to walk 
back toward the house.  A simper falls onto my face with Shion&#39;s back 
now turned toward me, just as my hand begins to unwillingly reach for 
my blaster.  She wants to take her time, wants to indulge the moment, 
so my sister has me reach for it very slowly.  I try to tell my body 
not to follow this action, but it ignores my pleads.  My fingers are 
now only an inch from the gun, I can feel the itch my fingers that 
continue to scream for them.  Finally they reach for the weapon&#39;s 
handle as my index finger wraps around the trigger.  A small click 
echoes into my ear as the gun leaves its holster and my arm begins to 
rise, pointing the barrel of my blaster at the back of her skull.
     
&quot;Miang, stop this, please!&quot; I try to plead.
     
&quot;Like daughter, like mother,&quot; she says.
     
Again I try to order my body to stop but it continues to ignore my 
commands.  I try to have my arm pull away, I try to have my hand drop 
the gun, and at the very least, I try to shut my eyes.  None of these 
happen, instead my finger begins to squeeze at the weapon&#39;s trigger.  
The trigger is only a millimeter away from having a shot fired and it 
still continues to pull.  I can still do nothing but wait for the 
inevitable.
     
&quot;Hyah!&quot; a force suddenly pushes my arm down.
     
The blaster falls out of my hand at that exact moment, not a shell not 
blast escapes the barrel of the gun.  My vision then turns to the 
source of the attack to find Jin standing before me with his sword in 
hand and pointing it toward the ground.  His appearance is different 
before; for once his eyes are narrowed and his composure collected.  
The way he holds his sword, it&#39;s as if he&#39;s used it many times to slay 
others.  Without wasting another second, he raises he sword upward 
quickly, its blade slicing upward in the process.  My body jumps away 
at the last moment, my legs pushing far into the ground so that it may 
launch me into the sky for a brief moment before I land back on the 
ground a few feet away from Jin.
     
&quot;Shion, get out of here, now!&quot; Jin orders his sister.
     
&quot;What?&quot; Shion looks back to her brother, finally aware of the situation.
     
&quot;Just go!&quot; he orders again.
     
&quot;Jin, why are you pointing your sword at Elly?!&quot; she yells at him.
     
&quot;She tried to kill you,&quot; he answers, &quot;now go!&quot;
     
&quot;Jin, Elly would never...!&quot;
     
&quot;That&#39;s right, Elly wouldn&#39;t,&quot; a small laugh escapes my mouth.
     
&quot;Miang?!&quot;
     
&quot;Miang?&quot; Jin says puzzled.
     
&quot;Stop this!&quot; my vision turns back to the house to find the others 
heading outside.
     
&quot;It&#39;s a miracle you&#39;re all still alive,&quot; Miang speaks through my voice 
again.
     
&quot;Shion, what&#39;s wrong with her?&quot; the young realian asks my lover.
     
&quot;It&#39;s her sister, she awake again,&quot; Shion informs her.
     
&quot;So it wasn&#39;t KOS-MOS that attacked us back on the Elsa?&quot; Jr. asks, 
keeping his pistol pointed at me.
     
&quot;It&#39;s a long story, but this is not the KOS-MOS we all know,&quot; Shion 
answers.
     
&quot;But how&#39;s that possible,&quot; Allen asks, &quot;I thought the current KOS-MOS&#39;s
program was...&quot;
     
&quot;Stop talking!&quot; Miang orders.  &quot;R-CANNON!&quot;
     
The weapon appears on my arm as it normally did in the past but this 
time without my consent.  Without wasting a single moment, a shot is 
fired at the others.  Rock and dust flies into the air after, but there
is no sign of the others.  My scanners return at this moment as well, 
but like my weapons and body, it is not under my control.  It picks up 
seven life forms within the dust, and again my weapon takes aim again.
Before it can fire however, several hails of bullets escape the clouds 
in my direction.  Clang, clang, clang, each of the projectiles bounce 
off my skin on the moment of impact.  My scanners then pick up five of 
the seven dashing toward me while the remaining two run away.  The 
R-CANNON disappears from my arm at that instant, it appears as though 
Miang wants to fight each of them without the aid of weapon.  The 
cyborg is the first to come out of the dust cloud, jumping toward me 
with his left foot in the lead.  My body steps to the side to avoid the
attack, but before the cyborg could land, it grabs his legs and tosses 
him back into the cloud of dust toward the direction where the other 
two ran.
     
&quot;Ziggy!&quot; I hear the young realian scream from within.
     
The clouds have cleared now and I can see the others perfectly now.  
More bullets escape Jr.&#39;s gun at this moment, but again the ricochet 
away from me the moment they touch my skin.  Three manage to land in my
palm, and with a flick of the wrist they return to its owner.  Each of 
the projectiles manages to embed themselves in a different limb of the 
U.R.T.V., one in his left arm, and the other two on his legs.
     
&quot;Allen, watch Ziggy,&quot; I turn back to the young realian as she finishes 
using a can of nanospray on his wounds, &quot;I have to help Jr.&quot;
     
&quot;Stupid child!&quot; Miang spits, the R-CANNON returning to my arm again.
     
My arm is suddenly pushed back again, and again I find Jin before me.  
Another thrust follows after his previous attack, but my other arm 
catches it with my wrist.  More strikes begin to follow, each of them 
cutting from a random direction, but both my arms manage to block each
of his attacks.  The pattern continues over and over again, but neither
of us are able to push the other back.  Suddenly my body stops 
defending and the katana&#39;s blade manages to embed itself on my left 
shoulder.  A hole is cut through the skin, and tiny sparks of 
electricity escapes soon after.  None of these sparks manages to touch 
Jin, but he stands paralyzed from the shock that his attack did 
nothing.  My right arm then quickly lunges for Jin&#39;s neck, my fingers 
quickly wrapping around them.
     
Before anything else could be done, my scanners pick up another running
toward me.  This time it&#39;s the silver-haired boy, but unfortunately 
Miang doesn&#39;t allow him to speak this time, throwing Jin in his 
direction instead.
     
&quot;Miang, stop this!&quot; my body quickly turns around to find Shion.
     
&quot;Shion, don&#39;t come any closer!&quot; I try to order, but nothing escapes my 
lips.
     
&quot;You...,&quot; Miang spits through my teeth.
     
&quot;I know I&#39;m the cause of all your pain, Miang,&quot; Shion begins to step 
forward, &quot;so if my death will allow you to smile again...&quot;
     
&quot;Shion, don&#39;t!&quot;
     
&quot;Are you that eager to die?&quot; Miang asks.
     
&quot;A real mother would do anything for her child, that&#39;s why...&quot;
     
&quot;Stop it!&quot; the words finally manage to escape my lips.
     
My body falls to the floor at that moment and my entire body is now 
suddenly covered in sweat.  My entire body is sore, and I feel a sharp 
pain on my shoulder and arms with a substance oozing from them.  My 
breath has  become heavy, and my strength feels like its pouring out of
me with every drop of blood that escapes my wounds.  Still, with what 
little strength I have left, I have to tell Shion something.
     
&quot;Shion,&quot; I barely say her name between my breaths, &quot;don&#39;t sacrifice 
your life if it&#39;s only going to please one person.  Didn&#39;t you think 
about what the others would go through if you were to die, what I&#39;d go 
through?!&quot; I begin to raise my voice.
     
&quot;Elly...?&quot;
     
&quot;Shion, why do you have to throw away your life so easily to her?&quot; my 
eyes begin to tear.  &quot;Is it just to repay for what you did to her back 
then?!  That&#39;s bull shit, Shion!&quot; I swear at the top of my lungs.  &quot;You
can&#39;t just throw your life away expecting everything to work, isn&#39;t 
that what you taught me just now?!&quot;
     
&quot;Elly, I...&quot;
     
&quot;Don&#39;t bother answering her,&quot; Miang&#39;s voice suddenly whispers into my 
ear.
     
The entire area suddenly grows black at this moment, much like the 
other times I had encountered Miang, but something is different this 
time.  The others are here with me now, but Miang is here as well.  I 
try to run toward Shion, but my hair is suddenly caught in something,
as if it were being grasped.  A small scream escapes my lips as the 
pain runs into the back of my skull; I try to reach for the source of
the pull, but my arms cannot reach.  The pain intensifies soon after,
my body being dragged toward the source.  My back meets with my 
sister&#39;s body within seconds, her arms quickly wrapping around my neck,
bringing her face right next to mine.  My fingers ball into a fist
after, yet I don&#39;t feel any strength left in my arms to push them back
enough to free me from her hold.  I try to pull my way free instead, 
but the force I exert on her arm isn&#39;t strong enough to even more it an
inch.  The more I pull, the more the crimson floods run down my arms
and shoulder.  Suddenly my arms grow limp and they fall to my side,
they refuse to move no matter how I hard I command them.
     
&quot;You stay right here, dear sister,&quot; my sister orders me.
     
&quot;What the, what&#39;s going on?!&quot; Allen begins to panic.
     
&quot;Huh?&quot; Jin begins to return to his feet.
     
&quot;What the, who&#39;s that?!&quot; Jr. exclaims as he points toward me.
     
&quot;Miang...,&quot; Shion turns to the one holding me.
     
&quot;This is your doing, isn&#39;t it?!&quot; my sister begins to yell into the 
abyss.  &quot;You parasite, come out here and show yourself!&quot;
     
&quot;It is her,&quot; chaos speaks as pushes himself off the ground, &quot;the 
original.&quot;
     
&quot;That&#39;s the original KOS-MOS?&quot; MOMO asks.
     
&quot;Shion...,&quot; I call for my lover with what little strength I have left.
     
&quot;Miang, let Elly go!&quot; Shion orders, the M.W.S. appearing on her arm 
afterward.
     
&quot;I thought you were sympathizing me just a second ago,&quot; the hold around
my neck tightens.
     
&quot;Let her go!&quot; Shion repeats herself.
     
&quot;How long do you think she will last?&quot; Miang asks, her free arm 
beginning to stroke mine.  &quot;Your brother cut her pretty deep, don&#39;t you
think?&quot;
     
&quot;Ugh!&quot; I scream as her fingers glide through my wounds.
     
&quot;Dammit, if only I hadn&#39;t...,&quot; Jin swears.
     
&quot;What do you intend to do with her, Miang?&quot; Shion asks, her weapon 
still pointed.
     
&quot;I only intend to return things back to the way they were, there&#39;s 
nothing wrong with that,&quot; she answers.
     
&quot;Shion...&quot;
     
I feel so weak now, everything is beginning to blur.  So tired, 
everything feels so heavy now, even my eyelids.  Breathing is becoming 
difficult too, and everything is weighing to the floor.  I can&#39;t seem 
to stand anymore, my sister is keeping me on my feet as she holds me.
     
&quot;She&#39;s not going to last much longer,&quot; my sister&#39;s voice begins to grow
deaf, &quot;if she dies here, neither of us will have the chance to get what
we want.&quot;
     
&quot;I told you to let her go!&quot; Shion repeats.
     
&quot;You&#39;re not the one to make demands here,&quot; Miang tells her.  &quot;If you 
want her to survive, you&#39;ll have to let me go, but don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll 
find each other soon enough so I&#39;ll be able to finish you all off 
later.  So how about it, do we have a deal?&quot;
     
&quot;No Shion, don&#39;t do it...&quot;
     
Black is the only color I see now, no more colors of any sort.  I&#39;m 
starting to lose feeling of everything now, even the hold my sister has
on my neck.  Taking in air doesn&#39;t seem to do anything anymore either, 
I can&#39;t seem to exhale either.  My hearing is starting to grow deaf, 
but there is one more word I am able to hear, one that will continue to
dread me in the afterlife.
     
&quot;...deal...&quot;

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Author&#39;s Note: Well, how was it?  Personally I found the pacing pretty 
slow and I kinda repeated myself at times, but I tried my best, I hope 
you enjoyed it.  This was the hardest chapter I had to write, the 
reason being was because I tried my best not to make Elly so depressed,
but that seemed to have failed due to the events of the story.  I&#39;m 
kinda rusty on actions scenes as well, it&#39;s been months since I wrote
one for any story.  Well, if you want to review, go ahead, but no 
flames or anything like that.  Two more chapters left for this fic and 
it&#39;s done, I assure you those ones won&#39;t be as slow-paced and I hope 
you find the final chapters pleasing.  That&#39;s it for now, later people!
