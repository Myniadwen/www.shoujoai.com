<h1>Mother (part 1 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbman.html">cbman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>cbman&#39;s Note: Welcome to &quot;Mother,&quot; the sequel to &quot;Bound.&quot;  Before the 
story can begin, it is best that I explain to you readers that this is 
an Alternate Universe of Xenosaga Episode 2 and will try to connect 
Xenosaga with Xenogears with a few changes to Xenosaga&#39;s and 
Xenogears&#39;s stories.  Though it is not necessary for you readers to 
have played Xenogears beforehand, it will help you understand some of 
the events that occur within the story (unfortunately this also results
in giving away spoilers of Xenogears&#39;s story).  Unlike this fic&#39;s 
prequels, this story will be told in multiple POV, most of these other 
POV written by other fan fic authors whom I asked for help for this 
story.  The story&#39;s pacing will be a bit slower too than the previous 
volumes, but each character will be fleshed out a lot more than the 
previous installments.  I&#39;d also like to thank ChaosDreamer, 
EvilLilMonk (not affiliated with ff.net),  ExDream (not affiliated with
ff.net), Ruby (not affiliated with ff.net), and my &quot;sis,&quot; Shi Maxwell 
for helping me out with this fic.  (You can see which author plays what
role in our shared pen name, &quot;Team KOS-MOS,&quot; at ff.net.)  With that 
said, I present to you the third story in Elly and Shion&#39;s romance,
&quot;Mother.&quot;
  
ExDream&#39;s Note: Hope you like it and that I captured the character 
(Ziggy).  The most important thing to do is remember that this isn&#39;t 
the Ziggy from the end of episode one, but the Ziggy at the end of 
&quot;Bound.&quot;

The Cogs Turn Once More
  
  
(chaos&#39;s POV)
  
       
&quot;They&#39;re moving again, aren&#39;t they?&quot; he asks me.
       
&quot;Yes, I&#39;m afraid so,&quot; I nod in response.
       
Today is the third night we&#39;ve all been staying at the Uzuki Residence,
it&#39;s been a nice change of pace looking back on the events that 
happened within the last month.  Staying in a remote place such as 
this, it helps me put my mind at rest a little.  Come to think of it, 
there was never really a time I could really have myself totally relax,
there&#39;s always been something, someone, in the back of my mind.  
Whenever I think I have achieved peace in my mind, my thoughts always 
dwindle back toward that person and our purpose...
       
The candlelight begins to flicker with the evening breeze, the wind 
sending a small chill down my spine.  Is it really the wind that&#39;s 
making me feel uncomfortable, or is it because his presence and our 
goal are drawing closer?  The cold steel on Death&#39;s scythe, I can 
already see it hovering over the heads of the people of this world.
       
&quot;You know as much as I do that I don&#39;t want Shion to be involved in 
any of this,&quot; Jin tells me, &quot;she&#39;s already gone through so much when 
our mother and father died, even more so when her last love was killed,
I can&#39;t bear to see her when...&quot;
       
&quot;I&#39;m afraid it can&#39;t be avoided, Jin,&quot; I regretfully tell him, &quot;your 
sister is very loyal to her, always wanting to be by her side, as is 
she to your sister.  Even as we speak, she is with Shion.&quot;

(Elly&#39;s POV)
  
       
Shades of green and brown fill the scenery before me, strands of these 
colors breaking into streaks and columns.  Through the spacing of some 
of these streaks, I find similar features.  The weapon in my hands 
barely pulls my arms to the ground, but it is the lack of breath that 
weighs the rest of my body to the floor.  My white military uniform is 
stained with so much grime and moss, even the black gloves and lines 
along the center of the clothing are painted with the colors of 
shrubbery.  Perspiration runs down my entire brow, the cool liquid does
nothing to calm the pacing of my heart.  So tired, I can&#39;t remember the
last time I&#39;ve been this cautious and alert.
       
Another image comes into my vision, this one appears through the spaces
between the branches I look through; I see a young man with a long 
braid that goes down to his lower back. He wears a pair of dark green 
baggy pants, a plate-like device near his stomach, and a white-colored 
shirt with blue lining.  His face is somewhat sharp, his dark-brown 
eyes somewhat narrow and his nose a little pointed.  A long strand of 
hair crawls down his face, it looks like two pieces of hair that he 
missed when he put his hair in a braid.  He begins to move forward but 
he fails to notice me.  His back is now turned and I now spring from my
hiding place with my gun pointed.
       
&quot;Annahas!&quot; I order the man, my weapon still pointed.  &quot;Anna herok, ak 
vite!  Rannha ak vite!  Rannha kal tik!&quot;
       
The man looks at me with a puzzled look on his face, as if he doesn&#39;t 
understand what I&#39;m saying.  Then it hits me,  he really doesn&#39;t 
understand what I&#39;m saying.
       
&quot;Throw down your weapon!&quot; I order in his native language.  &quot;Make one 
wrong move and I&#39;ll shoot!  Errh...,&quot; I try to recall the correct word 
in his language, &quot;Turn around!&quot;
       
The young man still looks at me with a puzzled look on his face, but 
this time I know he understands what I&#39;m saying.  I bet he&#39;s not 
intimidated by me because I&#39;m a woman.  Just the thought of him 
thinking like that makes my blood boil.
       
&quot;I said...turn around!&quot; I repeat myself, my finger beginning to squeeze
the trigger.
       
Without wasting another second, the man raises his arms, his back 
slowly turning toward me.  I begin to approach him now, his body still 
within the sights of my pistol.  I begin to inspect him closer, namely 
the uniform he is wearing.  He doesn&#39;t seem like too much of a threat, 
but still, I have to be cautious.
       
&quot;...Are you shaking?&quot; the man suddenly asks.
       
&quot;Be quiet!&quot; I retort.  &quot;...you don&#39;t seem to be one of the Kislev 
Soldiers who are after me...,&quot; I say upon closer inspection, &quot;but...  
Don&#39;t move!&quot; the man suddenly turns around, forcing me to bring my 
finger back to my gun&#39;s trigger.  &quot;I have orders to kill all surface 
dwellers, -Lambs-, I come in contact with...  It&#39;s part of my mission.
It&#39;s nothing personal.  I have a question for you,&quot; I begin to lower my
gun.  &quot;...How do I get out of this forest?&quot;
       
&quot;Are you lost?&quot; the man asks.
       
&quot;Just answer my question!&quot; I repeat myself once more.  &quot;How do I get 
out of here?&quot;
       
&quot;Sorry... but I&#39;m looking for the way out too,&quot; he apologizes.
       
&quot;Oh...,&quot; I lower my weapon.
       
My eyes begin to linger to the ground now, it seems like it might take 
me even longer to get out of this place.  It&#39;s already been about a day
since I came here and I already miss seeing the light of day without 
having the sight of tree branches or leaves getting in the way.  I 
could also use a warm meal and bath, I&#39;m sick of rations and the smell 
of moss on my clothing.  I really need to...
       
&quot;How long are you just going to stand there like that?&quot; the young man 
interrupts my thoughts.  &quot;If you&#39;re going to shoot me, then hurry up 
and do it.&quot;
       
&quot;What an odd thing to say!&quot; his words catch my interest.  &quot;Don&#39;t you 
understand the situation you&#39;re in?&quot;
       
&quot;I don&#39;t care about my situation...,&quot; he begins to sulk.  &quot;I&#39;m just a 
guy whose life is worthless...  There&#39;s no point in me living anyway!&quot;
       
For a moment he stares at the ground, but then he begins to approach 
me.  My body begins to push back on its own accord at this moment, my 
weapon returning its aim toward him.
       
&quot;Sta, stay back!&quot; I order.
       
Blam!  My finger pulls the trigger, but my aim is off, the bullet 
striking at a nearby tree instead.  A warning shot, that&#39;s all I&#39;ll 
give him for now.  I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll understand his situation after I give
him one.  I wait a few more seconds, waiting him to back away or place 
his hands behind his head, but to my surprise, he still stands in the
same spot with his arms still dangling at his side and eyes glued to 
the ground.
       
&quot;What are you aiming at?&quot; he asks, his voice as cool and resolute as 
ever.  &quot;Here!  Shoot me here!&quot; he brings his hand to chest.  &quot;C&#39;mon...&quot;
       
&quot;Are...are you mocking me?&quot; I begin to lower my gun.  &quot;You&#39;re weird!&quot; I
begin to back away.  &quot;Something&#39;s very wrong with you!  You should at 
least resist a little bit!&quot;
       
What have I gotten myself into?  Someone with a death wish, this was 
really unexpected.  Well if he really is suicidal, there&#39;s no point in 
wasting any bullets on him, he&#39;ll kill himself eventu...
       
The ground suddenly shakes for a second, as if something fell behind 
me.  I ready my gun once more and quickly turn around to find a pair of
individuals with scaly blue skin.  The stench of blood is very apparent
in their body odor, their teeth a dull brass yellow and brown.  Their 
eyes are narrow, their breath heavy as mist, whatever their intent is, 
I know it&#39;s not good.
       
&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; I try to speak with them.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;
       
Before I can get a response, I suddenly find a force being exerted on 
my body and myself falling to the floor.  My gun slips from my hand now
and the world around me begins to fade.  I see the suicidal young man 
in my vision now, a new expression now worn on his face.  Anger, that&#39;s
what I see in his eyes and his fists as he suddenly dashes forward.
       
&quot;Stop!&quot; he orders my attackers.  &quot;Keep your hands off of Elly!&quot;
       
&quot;Elly,&quot; I hear another voice calling my name now.  &quot;Elly...&quot;
       
&quot;Hm...?&quot; I begin to stir.
       
The color of black begins to disappear from my eyes, the smell of 
nature and fatigue disappearing.  I find a warm surface resting on my 
cheek now, the surface slowly beating against my face.  I bring my arm 
around the side of my haven&#39;s body, burying my face further in.  I find
my body beginning to rise however, rising with the surface I rest 
against.  So soft, so warm, I just feel so comfortable lying here.  I 
like the tiny breezes that go down my brow and hair, I enjoy the sound 
that echoes beneath the surface, and the aroma of this place, I can 
never tire of it, nor can I tire of its sweet, succulent taste.
       
&quot;Shion...,&quot; I barely call her as I bury my head further into her heart.
       
Is it wrong for me to love my mother in this way?  Can it be considered
a sin?  No, I do not think so, she never gave birth to me, she created 
me originally from metal and electronics, I was born into this world in
an unnatural manner.  The way I love my creator, my mother, is it wrong
to love her in more ways than one?  I do not think so, even my sister 
who had fallen for our father did not think so when she fell for him.
       
&quot;Elly, it&#39;s time to get up,&quot; my lover breathes into my ear.
       
I begin to open my eyes now, peeling away at the darkness to find 
myself in a familiar place.  Shion&#39;s room, it&#39;s the same as how I left 
it before I fell asleep.  I find myself still drifting back into 
slumber however, but the brush of my lover&#39;s finger gliding down my 
cheek begins to drag me away from slumber once more.
       
&quot;Good morning,&quot; she greets me now.
       
&quot;Good morning, Shion,&quot; I return the greeting after a yawn.
       
&quot;Did you sleep well?&quot; she asks.
       
&quot;Mm-hm,&quot; I answer.
       
Did I sleep well?  I wouldn&#39;t say so.  I had such a strange dream, I 
can&#39;t really remember it too well.  From what I can remember, I was in 
some kind of forest, hiding for some reason, and there was this man, 
who was he?  That language I was speaking too before I spoke English, I
can&#39;t even translate it now that I&#39;m awake.  Oh well, it was just a 
dream, there&#39;s no need to think about it too much.
       
Reality returns to me a second later, the taste of my lover&#39;s lips 
suddenly seeps before my mouth.  They press against each other for a 
mere second, but it is enough to remove me from the remnants of my 
slumber.  Her fingers begin to run through my hair now, freeing the 
strands from any knots.  I can&#39;t help but smile as she brushes my hair,
just the feel of her hands and the sight of her emerald pupils is 
enough for my lips to curl.
       
Another press falls upon my lips now, this one more aggressive than 
the last.  The push of her lips pushes my entire body back for a mere 
second as the device within her mouth escapes to paint the lining of my
lips.  I welcome the slippery object into my own mouth, my lips closing
on it gently.  My own tongue begins to wrestle with hers now, trying so
desperately to climb my lover&#39;s.  Her mouth parts with my own now, 
slipping away with relative ease while leaving a translucent string 
between them.  The string breaks within seconds, my tongue escaping my 
mouth for moment so that I may collect the thread&#39;s remains that have 
fallen before my lips.
       
Another touch falls upon my body now, this one rubbing against my 
cheek.  My entire body begins to melt at my lover&#39;s touch, melting with
each inch her hand falls as it travels down my face and then to my 
neck.  My fingers begin to trail down her shoulders now, my face also 
traveling down until my cheek once again finds her heart.  I find her
own fingers moving now moving to the buttons on my flannel shirt, 
slowly plucking at the round hooks and freeing them from their prison.
       
&quot;Shion, don&#39;t,&quot; I place my hand on top of hers.  &quot;Please, not now.&quot;
       
&quot;What should I believe,&quot; she asks in barely a whisper, &quot;your words, or 
your lips?&quot;
       
Another kiss falls upon my lips again, this one more aggressive than 
the last.  My mouth once again bickers with her own, fighting so 
desperately the moment I find my back resting against the mattress.  
The taste of the honey within her mouth, I can never tire of it, how 
she teases me with it every time we kiss.  The bait, that&#39;s what it 
always is when we make love, always using it as bait to get what she 
wants, and like other times in the past, I fall for the bait.
       
&quot;Ah!&quot; I yelp the moment I realize her hand has found its way into my 
top.  &quot;Shion don&#39;t, what if the others catch us?&quot; I ask in between my 
breaths.
       
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, no one will hear us,&quot; she says in a husky voice before 
returning her mouth unto mine.
       
My body begins to relax once more, my mind clearing away any thoughts 
of the others.  My mind begins to focus on the texture of her lips once
more and the feel of her palm as it hugs the surface of my breast.  Her
hand begins to rotate within my shirt now, bringing with it the globe 
that was in her hand.  Every second increases the speed of the rotation
and the sucking of her mouth, and more and more I find myself melting.
I break our kiss again soon after, breaking the moment the tips of her 
fingers press against my nipple.  My lover does not allow my entire 
yelp to escape, cutting it off by pressing her lips onto mine once again.
       
Her hand brushes away from my chest now, pulling one side of my shirt 
away in the process.  The other half is pulled away from my shoulder in
the same manner, pulled until the material meets with the floor.  Her 
mouth leaves mine again as it begins to travel down my neck once more.
She plants her lips once every inch she travels, she one deeper than 
the last.  I nearly scream at the last kiss, her lips barely opening to
fit one of the nubs of my breasts within her mouth.  Her tongue 
replaces her lips now, the slippery object now lightly tapping at the 
nub from different angles.  My breath grows even shorter now, I try my 
best not to cry any louder so that I may alert the others, but I know I
can&#39;t hold it in much longer.
       
&quot;Shion...,&quot; I barely call her name.
       
The lapping comes to a halt suddenly and I find myself finally able to
catch my breath.  Before I could take in more than a single breath, I 
find the top half my body now rising upward as the arms of my lover 
pull me.  My face comes to a stop at the thin cotton material that 
covers Shion&#39;s upper body, my nose buried in between the cleavage of 
her breasts.  Her hands tend to my hair for a moment, stroking away the
tresses at my temple before finding their way to the buttons on her 
clothing.  One by one she slowly releases each one from their hold, 
exposing more of her beautiful and fair skin right before my eyes.  The
two halves of her top eventually come undone, her arms once again
wrapping around my head after.  My own hands begin to move on their own
accord now, slipping upward as it traces her thighs, sides, and 
eventually shoulders.  The moment they reach the peak of her shoulders,
my hands begins to fall again, tracing down the halves of her clothing.
My hands stop just in front of my cheeks, my fingers now beginning to
move inside the gaps that separate the clothing and her body.  
       
My lips begin to press against the skin before me, lightly suckling 
inside the cleavage.  Tiny gasps begin to escape my lover&#39;s lips as my 
mouth traces in between her breasts, but the taste here pales in 
comparison to the texture and sensitivity of the areas close by.  
Impatient now, my hands sweep away the material that hide her upper 
body, quickly tossing it to the side of the bed.  The chocolate-colored
nubs on the other side are the first sight to greet me the moment I 
free them from their cotton prison, both of them already swollen due to
the teasing I had given to their owner.  I bring my hands to the peaks 
of her breasts now, the tip of my nails barely sliding against them 
causing them to swell further.  A louder gasp escapes my lover&#39;s mouth 
the moment I first touch them causing her entire body to jump.  My 
hands decide to push forward now, slowly tracing themselves to the base
of her breasts.  Slowly they begin to take hold of the tender flesh,
pulling them closer toward me as my lover&#39;s body begins to brush 
against mine.  I open my mouth the moment one of her nipples touch my 
face, engulfing the entire tip for a tiny moment.  I free it for a mere
second before suckling it again, causing more purrs and gasps to escape
from my lover&#39;s lips.  The fingers of my left hand attend to its twin, 
my thumb and index finger lightly pulling at it between the breaks of 
my suckling.
       
I find her hands beginning to slide down my sides now, but they stop at
the material that covers the lower half of my body.  Her thumbs reach 
inward and begin to push downward, pulling down my pants and layer of 
cotton that guards my sex to my ankles.  My free hand begins to do the 
same with her now as I quickly find the rims of her undergarments, 
quickly pulling them and the material that covers the rest of her lower
body.  Barriers of cotton no longer fill the space between our skin, 
but the barriers that hold the flood begin to open.
       
&quot;Shion..., I...,&quot; I try to inform her.
       
&quot;Wait,&quot; she orders me, returning my lips to her breast.
       
The source of the flood begins to brush up against hers now.  The 
surface is so warm, yet so wet making our bodies slide against one 
another with ease.  Again I find myself concentrated on the sweet 
texture of her nipples, trading between each one every two or three 
seconds.  The sweet ambrosia from within begins to escape now, the
delicious substance barely painting the tips of her nipples and lining 
of my mouth.  I begin to pull harder now, pulling so that I may get 
more of the wine that was made for her child.
       
&quot;Shion, I can&#39;t hold it any longer...,&quot; I tell her, &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot;
       
The flood between my legs breaks through the barriers between my legs 
now, the warm rush mingling with another in the same instant.  Both of 
our bodies begin to tingle now, the air around us quickly cooling the 
rush that barely connects us.  My lover begins to fall back to the 
mattress now, my body following after as my cheek once again rests on
her heart.  Our breaths are once again heavy, everything just feels so 
light and clear now.  Fingers begin to trail down my cheek once again, 
stopping at my chin and pulling it so that I may look into my lover&#39;s 
emerald pupils.
       
&quot;Elly, I love you,&quot; she whispers as I stare into those beautiful jewel 
orbs.
       
&quot;I love you too, Shion.&quot;
       
With my remaining strength, I pull myself closer, my lips once again 
meeting with hers.  The fires of passion begin to cool as our lips 
touch, the inferno slowly dying with every second that passes.  The 
fire eventually does die, but the warmth in our hearts burns as bright as ever.
       
&quot;Shion,&quot; Jin calls from downstairs, &quot;you have a phone call!&quot;
       
&quot;This early, I wonder who it could be?&quot; Shion speaks to herself after 
breaking our kiss.  &quot;Elly, why don&#39;t you go take a shower while I see 
who&#39;s calling me.&quot;
       
&quot;All right,&quot; I nod.
       
Without wasting another second, my lover to her closet and takes out 
one of her many Vector uniforms.  I watch her as she dresses, observing
how she shields her true form to the world.  Not once does she tease me
while she dresses, putting her clothes on in a somewhat swift fashion.
My lover is very different when we&#39;re not in the heat of passion, no 
longer does she tease me with her flesh or tickle me with her whispers,
she always gets to the point when she speaks and her words are always 
spoken in a serious tone.  After she finishes dressing, she turns back 
to me and places a kiss on her palm and blows it toward me the moment 
after.
       
&quot;I&#39;ll see you at breakfast,&quot; she tells me in her normal tone of voice.
       
With Shion now gone, I decide to take up on her offer to take a shower.
Her scent, if I could have it my way I would never get rid of it from 
my body, however I know that it is improper to have it in the presence 
of others.  I head into Shion&#39;s closet after and try to find my 
wardrobe for the day.  I think I&#39;ve borrowed enough of Shion&#39;s clothing
since I got here, so I decide to go with my usual attire.  Luckily 
Shion has it washed every time I wear it, so there&#39;s no need to be 
worried about it being dirty or anything.
       
I begin to walk down the hall to the bathroom now, my clothes and towel
in hand.  My thoughts begin to drift toward the events that occurred in
my dream again.  The smell of moss, the sight of shrubbery, and the 
constant beats of my heart, the experience comes back to me.  I haven&#39;t
had too many dreams until recently, maybe I&#39;m just reading into this 
one too much because it&#39;s the most unique one I had so far.  But that 
man who was in it peaks my interest; he seemed so desperate, but why?  
Oh well, it was just a dream, there&#39;s nothing to really dwell about.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
(Shion&#39;s POV)
  
       
The living room has always been busy since I got back, the house is so 
full of life for once.  I mean I didn&#39;t really mind talking to Jin too 
much every morning whenever I was home, it&#39;s just that it&#39;s nice to 
have a lot of company in our home.  Although I have to admit, I do feel
bad that everyone except Elly has to sleep downstairs, I guess I&#39;m a 
little greedy sharing my room and bed with only her.  The least I could
do is have MOMO sleep with us next time, although I&#39;m not sure if Elly 
would be comfortable with that.  When Elly thinks of the term &quot;sleep 
together,&quot; I&#39;m sure that means &quot;make love&quot; in her mind after what 
happened just now.  I should explain to her what I mean when I ask her 
later if it&#39;s okay.
       
The crystal on my necklace begins to bounce against the base of my 
neck, catching my attention.  My feet come to a stop at the moment to 
stop this.  My fingers run underneath the chain until the crystal finds
itself in my palm.  The jewel shimmers as bright as ever, it still 
illuminates as much as it did when I first saw it.
       
It was four years ago when I first saw this piece, but back then it 
wasn&#39;t mine to begin with.  I had just joined Vector shortly after 
graduating high school, amazingly I was accepted into the First R&amp;D 
Division with a simple High School Diploma.  It was during my first day
of work when I first laid eyes on it, along with its previous wearer.
       
&#39;I can&#39;t believe I overslept the night before my first day at work!&#39; I 
remember thinking to myself as I hurried to my new workplace.
       
It was March 14, 4763, 8:30 in the morning, my first day at Vector and 
I was already late to work.  The night before I was trying to get 
accustomed to my new quarters; namely the bed, the mattress was 
entirely new and wasn&#39;t very comfortable.  On top of that, when I did 
wake up at exactly 8:00, the train was ten minutes late.  My bad luck 
didn&#39;t end there unfortunately, the layout of Vector HQ was still alien
to me at the time, I was practically running around the whole 
laboratory corridor looking for the right workplace.  I must&#39;ve not 
been watching out where I was going because the next thing I knew, I 
found myself accidentally running into somebody and falling to the 
floor.
       
&quot;Ouch...,&quot; was my first reaction the moment I suddenly found myself 
sitting on the floor.
       
&quot;Are you all right, Miss?&quot;
       
It was the first time I saw the necklace, but at the time, it was worn 
around its owner&#39;s wrist.  I had only glanced at the crystal for a mere
second, my eyes then wandering toward the actual owner.  He was of 
medium height but had broad shoulders, the Vector uniform couldn&#39;t hide
his chiseled body at all.  Eyes of ocean blue greeted me when I turned 
to his face, and hair of a navy shade sat atop his head in a bulb-like
fashion, though there was a strand that ran down part of his face.  I 
remember the device within my chest was striking against my rib cage as
fast as a hummingbird&#39;s wings, the air to my lungs suddenly growing 
short, and my throat suddenly parched.  I&#39;m not sure how long I was 
just sitting there, but I knew I had to respond eventually otherwise he
would just leave.
       
&quot;Um..., I&#39;m all right, thanks,&quot; I finally responded, taking his offered
hand into mine.
       
His hold on my hand was firm, I could feel his veins practically 
beating against the palm of my hand.  The skin of his palm was 
surprisingly soft, as if it were made to caress my own.  The pull of 
his arm to bring me back to my feet was surprisingly fast, I felt as if
I was suddenly sailing into the clouds.
       
&quot;I&#39;m very sorry for bumping into you,&quot; I apologized after while giving 
a bow.  &quot;It&#39;s my first day of work and I&#39;ve already found myself lost.&quot;
       
&quot;Ha ha, don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; he assured me with a slight chuckle, &quot;I 
was exactly the same way when I first started working here.  I&#39;m Kevin 
Winnicott,&quot; he introduced himself to me for the first time, &quot;and you 
are?&quot;
       
&quot;My name is Shion Uzuki,&quot; I introduced myself, taking his hand into 
mine again.  &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you, Mr... Winnicott?!  Oh my 
gosh, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; I found myself apologizing again after his name 
finally sank in.  &quot;Please forgive me sir, I didn&#39;t mean to be late for 
my first day, much less bump into you suddenly!  I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m really 
very sorry, please forgive me!&quot;
       
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay,&quot; he assured me again, &quot;there&#39;s no need to be so 
formal or apologetic.  Everyone&#39;s like that their first day, Ms. 
Uzuki.&quot;
       
&quot;Chief Winnicott, the CEO&#39;s on the line,&quot; another employee called from 
the workplace.
       
&quot;Well I need to take this,&quot; Kevin told me, &quot;it&#39;s nice meeting you, Ms. 
Uzuki, I look forward to working with you.&quot;
       
&quot;Yeah...,&quot; I waved as he ran toward the phone.
       
Kevin Winnicott, that was a name I would always hold dear in my heart, 
even to this day, I...
       
&quot;Ah, Shion, there you are,&quot; Jin&#39;s voice returns me to the present.
       
The past, for some reason I still frequently think about it, even after
all this time.
       
&quot;You said there&#39;s a phone call for me?&quot; I ask, trying to free my mind 
from my history.
       
&quot;Yeah, Allen&#39;s on the line right now,&quot; Jin answers, &quot;it&#39;s some guy with
a mustache and glasses.&quot;
       
&#39;Guy with a mustache and glasses?  This can&#39;t be good,&#39; I think to 
myself.
       
The Director, that&#39;s the only person I can think of that fits that 
description.  The last time we spoke I was angry with him, angry at his
orders.  Turn KOS-MOS, no, Elly, to the Second Division, there&#39;s no way
I could do such a thing, back then and now.  Or is this about me 
turning in information on Elly to the Federation Government when they
falsely accused the Durandal for destroying the Woglinde?  Come to 
think of it, I&#39;ve also been home for four days and I haven&#39;t reported 
to HQ yet.  Whatever the case may be, I know that whatever the director
has to say isn&#39;t going to be good.
       
&quot;Good day Director,&quot; I pick up the kitchen phone, bringing it to my 
ear.  &quot;Allen, you can hang up the phone from the living room,&quot; I call 
from the kitchen.
       
&quot;Hello Shion, it&#39;s been a while,&quot; the Director greets me on the other 
line.
       
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; I nod, &quot;I&#39;m very sorry for not contacting you sooner, there 
have been several hardships that had to be dealt with during the 
immediate time.&quot;
       
&quot;It&#39;s all right, Shion, I&#39;m just glad to hear that you and Allen are 
safe,&quot; he answers in his usual patient tone.  &quot;I hate to be blunt, but 
is KOS-MOS still with you?&quot;
       
&quot;Yes sir,&quot; I answer with a nod, &quot;she&#39;s in our custody at the moment, 
she&#39;s currently, uh, taking a shower.&quot;
       
&quot;That&#39;s good to hear, the people upstairs have been worried since 
communication with her has been cut off for the last four days,&quot; the 
Director explains, &quot;if it&#39;s all right, may I ask why that is so?&quot;
       
&quot;Well sir...,&quot; the events that occurred recently begin to flash through
my mind.
       
Where should I begin?  I&#39;m sure he already knows that the Woglinde was 
attacked by the Gnosis, so I guess I don&#39;t need to start there.  Maybe 
I can start with that whole incident with Commander Cherenkov?  No, 
that might take too much time to explain from there, and I can&#39;t 
exactly put that into a small and concise report at the moment.  The 
events that occurred recently between Elly and Miang?  Maybe there, but
would he even believe it?  I suppose I should just start with whatever 
comes out of my mouth.
       
&quot;Actually there&#39;s something I&#39;d like to discuss with you, it&#39;s very 
urgent,&quot; the Director interrupts before I can begin my report.
       
&quot;Urgent, sir?&quot; his words peak my interest.
       
&quot;Yes, it concerns KOS-MOS, but not only her, it&#39;s also about... huh, 
what the?&quot;
       
Before another word could be spoken on either line, the phone&#39;s screen 
suddenly begins to break, the colors disorienting and the environment 
hazing.  The image of the director begins to blur then just as another 
figure begins to appear on the screen.  The image of the other figure 
is too distorted for me to make out, all I can really see are the 
actions of this individual.  This person knocks the Director out of his
chair, sending him to the ground.  They begin their attack now, 
bringing their fist downward toward where I think the Director&#39;s skull 
is.  I see what I believe are the Director&#39;s arms rising after the
first impact, but another distorted individual makes their way into the
screen now, pinning down the Director&#39;s limbs.  The entire screen 
breaks apart now, breaking into tiny lines of black and gray that 
constantly move up and down the screen.  The sound of static takes the 
place over the director&#39;s voice and screams now, the constant buzzing
continuously ringing in my ears.
       
&quot;Director, what happened?!&quot; I ask frantically from my line.  
&quot;Director?&quot;
       
&quot;Do...n&#39;t....trap...KO...Zohar...,&quot; are the only words that come from 
the other line.
       
&quot;What, can you repeat that, sir?  You&#39;re breaking up.  Is everything 
all right?!&quot;
       
&quot;You&#39;ve said too much!&quot; one more voice says before the transmission 
ends.
       
The sound of static is all I get as an answer.  The gray lines on the 
screen disappear now, the entire screen turning black.  I stare at the 
phone&#39;s screen for a moment, waiting for the director to respond, but I
get nothing.  A flash of red appears in the empty screen for a second 
after, the same phrase being written over and over again across the 
black background.  Within the blink of an eye, the words are gone, now
replaced with a new logo saying &quot;Connection Lost.&quot;  I return the 
listening device to its charger and my thoughts begin to play the 
events that had just occurred.  The people who attacked the Director, 
who were they exactly, and why did they...?  Said too much, what was it
that the Director was trying to say that may have upset them?  Despite 
the event that had occurred, it&#39;s not the conversation that has me 
worried the most, it&#39;s the phrase that was posted all over the screen.
&quot;Ye shall be as Gods,&quot; is what was written over and over again, I can&#39;t
help but wonder why Elly&#39;s password was written all over the screen.
       
&quot;Shion, is something wrong?&quot; the blue-haired angel&#39;s voice interrupts 
my thoughts.
       
I turn around to find her dressed in her usual attire but with a towel 
in hand and hair.  The look of curiosity on her face, something she 
never showed me until now.  My little girl, she&#39;s matured so quickly 
and if I heard the director correctly, I may already have to let her go
in this short period of time, that is, if everything&#39;s still okay at 
Vector.
       
&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing,&quot; I answer.
       
&quot;Shion, I know that look,&quot; she tells me, &quot;it&#39;s not nothing.  
Something&#39;s obviously on your mind, Shion, what is it?&quot;
       
&quot;...it&#39;s about Vector,&quot; I try to tell her, &quot;the Director, he...&quot;
       
&quot;He&#39;s ordering me to return, isn&#39;t he?&quot; she asks.
       
&quot;...well, something like that, but...&quot;
       
&quot;Shion, we both knew this day would come eventually, but regardless, I 
still...&quot;
       
&quot;That&#39;s not it, Elly!&quot; I quickly interrupt.  &quot;It&#39;s the Director, 
someone attacked him in the middle of our conversation!&quot;
       
&quot;What?!&quot; a look of shock falls upon her face now.  &quot;But why?&quot;
       
&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; I answer, &quot;the Director was about to talk about 
something involving you but then...&quot;
       
&quot;Did you check with security after your call?&quot; our conversation is 
suddenly interrupted.
       
&quot;What, Ziggy?&quot;
       
&quot;Did you check with the security office over there to see if the 
building is still okay?&quot; the cyborg repeats himself.
       
&quot;Well, not yet, but...&quot;
       
&quot;You might want to try giving them a call,&quot; he explains, &quot;perhaps 
there&#39;s still time to catch the culprits involved if the rest of the 
building is in working order.&quot;
       
&quot;Yeah, I guess I&#39;ll try,&quot; I bring the phone back to my ear.
       
&quot;I&#39;ll inform the others about what happened,&quot; Elly tells me, &quot;if 
there&#39;s no response with the security office we may have to call the 
police.  If that&#39;s not enough, we may have to go Vector ourselves and 
catch the culprit.&quot;
       
&quot;Vector Second R&amp;D Division Security Office, how may we help you?&quot; the
person on the other line answers in the next second.
       
&quot;Yes, my name is Shion Uzuki of Vector&#39;s First R&amp;D Division,&quot; I 
introduce myself, &quot;I&#39;d like to know if everything is all right with the
Director, my last phone call with him ended so suddenly and...&quot;
       
&quot;Everything looks all right according to our surveillance cameras,&quot; the
guard on the other line says, &quot;hold on, I&#39;ll check with the guard 
stationed there.  One moment,&quot; he tells me as he picks up another phone
on his desk.  &quot;Hawwa, is everything all right in your station?  All 
right, I see.  Everything seems to be okay on this end,&quot; the guard
addresses me once more, &quot;I&#39;m sure his phone was just having some 
difficulties.&quot;
       
&quot;That can&#39;t be, I saw at least two people attack the Director during 
our conversation!&quot; I explain.  &quot;It can&#39;t just be phone difficulties, I 
know I saw...&quot;
       
&quot;Ma&#39;am, perhaps you&#39;re just being paranoid,&quot; the guard tells me, &quot;if 
anything had happened to the Director, the cameras would have caught 
it, and if those were somehow altered, our guards would have spotted 
the intruder before he set foot in his office.&quot;
       
&quot;But..!&quot;
       
&quot;Ma&#39;am, we assure you nothing is wrong with the Director, please try 
your call again later.  Good day now.&quot;
       
The phone suddenly dies at this moment, before I could get in another 
word.  I know what I just saw happened to the Director, I know I wasn&#39;t
just seeing things.  The guard said it could be phone difficulties, but
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case here. I&#39;m thinking that someone 
deliberately altered the surveillance cameras and possibly bribed the 
guard stationed there out of their post so that they could attack the 
director.
       
&quot;Shion, are you all right?  Were you able to get a hold of the security
office?&quot; the blue-haired angel&#39;s voice snaps me back to my senses.
       
&quot;We have to go now,&quot; I inform her, &quot;something&#39;s definitely wrong over 
there.&quot;
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
(Ziggy&#39;s POV)
  
       
Time, it is always against a soldier.  I see not only Ms. Uzuki 
panicking before my eyes but also another crisis to delay my mission.
I should take this opportunity to prepare MOMO and leave.  I cannot 
allow myself to get distracted again. 
       
I quietly leave the room as Jin and KOS-MOS continue to attempt to calm
Ms. Uzuki down.  They do not notice me as I leave, this is how it 
should be.  I am a cyborg, a machine, not a man.  Seeing KOS-MOS 
comforting Ms. Uzuki is rather odd.  A few weeks ago she was just like 
me, able to come and go from situations as needed and not really 
expected to participate emotionally. 
       
No, that is not completely accurate, I was a crossroad, MOMO still 
relied on me.  I intend to leave her soon.  She will be safer with the 
UMN, one of my few remaining human traits, intuition, tells me so. 
       
My suicide and rebirth made me forget many things, but not the thing 
that mattered most.  A long time ago I failed and lost something very 
important.  My only remaining goals are to lose this pain and to never 
feel it again. 
       
I leave the house and begin to make preparations to leave.  
       
&quot;So, the time has finally come?&quot; a loud rather harsh yet young voice 
interrupts my thoughts.  
       
&quot;It seems I am not as invisible as I thought, Jr.&quot; 
       
&quot;I know you want to take MOMO back to the UMN, don&#39;t you?&quot; 
       
&quot;She will be safer there.&quot; 
       
&quot;Isn&#39;t that where she was captured by U-TIC in the first place?&quot; 
       
&quot;You have also proven yourself unable to protect her.&quot;  At this the boy
cringes and glares at me.  &quot;At just the mere mention of that incident 
you begin to lose focus and let your emotions rule.  Can you really 
protect anyone like that?&quot; I ask.  He glares at me harder.  &quot;Will you 
be there when she needs you most?&quot; I continue. 
       
&quot;I already was, where were you?&quot;  I realize he is referring to the time
after Proto Merkabah. 
       
&quot;I never claimed I was any better suited for this.&quot; 
       
&quot;So you&#39;re just going to dump her off and call it a day?!&quot; 
       
His naivety shows behind the rage in his eyes. Then we both realize 
MOMO had come out and was watching. 
       
&quot;It&#39;s alright Jr.,&quot; she begins, &quot; I want to go, maybe I can see Mommy 
again.&quot; 
       
&quot;But...&quot; 
       
She silences Jr. with a finger and says, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, let&#39;s take one 
last look at the forest before we leave.&quot; 
       
She grabs his hand and pulls him away; he gives me one last glance 
before leaving. It is full of frustration, almost malice.  
       
My guilt, confusion, and his eyes are just three more things I can 
forget when I become a machine.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
(Elly&#39;s POV)
  
       
&quot;Oh really, that&#39;s nice!&quot; Shion exclaims as she speaks with several of 
the children.  &quot;Oh c&#39;mon Jin, hurry up...,&quot; my lover grumbles 
underneath her breath for the fifth time.
       
She&#39;s been so uneasy since that phone conversation she just had.  No, 
it&#39;s not the little children that are making her feel this way, it&#39;s 
the events that occurred when she was talking on the phone with the 
Director.  Did someone really attack him like Shion claims, and if that
is so, why?  Asking my lover the details would only upset her more I
think, so I decide it&#39;s best not to ask.
       
Shortly after her conversation with the Director, we all immediately 
left for Second Miltia City.  Shion, Allen, and I were supposed to go 
directly to Vector&#39;s Second R &amp; D Division the moment we arrived, but 
Jin insisted to go with us.  He wanted to stop by the orphanage he 
volunteered at before we went there to pick up his work schedule, and 
well, here we are...
       
&quot;Read me another story,&quot; I look to the other side of the room to find 
more children sitting around MOMO, who holds a fairy tale book in her hands.
       
&quot;All right, which story do you want me to read next?&quot; the young realian
responds with a smile.
       
Everyone seems to be busy right now with their own set of kids, well 
almost everybody, Ziggy just seems to be standing in a corner.  MOMO is
reading stories to a small group, Jr. and chaos are playing ball with 
some others, Shion and Allen are talking with a group of their own, but
Jin seems to be doing something else with another adult.
       
&quot;So you&#39;re sure you won&#39;t need me for this week, Miss Yui?&quot; he asks the
caretaker of the orphanage.
       
&quot;Yes, but we would still appreciate it if you still dropped by to 
visit,&quot; the woman answers.
       
I can tell by the way he converses with this woman that he&#39;s not 
really interested in his work schedule, and since when did one need a 
schedule for volunteer work?  I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it, but he
seems to be paying a lot of attention to her.  I feel bored once more, 
I&#39;m not sure how to interact with children.  Well there&#39;s no real need
to, it seems like the others are already preoccupied with all of them.
       
My vision begins to turn to the corner of the room now and I find 
someone else sitting there.  A little boy sits in this corner, all by 
himself.  Dark brown hair and eyes, his hair tied back, but two long 
bangs in the front of his face that seemed to have been missed.  His 
skin is somewhat tanned, his clothing a dull gray, and his face wearing
a lonely expression.  This boy, he looks familiar, where have I seen 
him before...  For some reason I find myself approaching him now, even 
though I have no idea what to say to him when I reach him.
       
&quot;Um..., hello,&quot; are the only words I can think of to say to him.
       
&quot;...hi,&quot; the boy weakly responds, turning his attention to several 
building blocks at his feet.
       
&quot;...what are you doing?&quot; I find myself trying to engage in a 
conversation with the boy.
       
&quot;Playing blocks,&quot; the boy answers as he begins to stack them.
       
&quot;That&#39;s nice, but why don&#39;t you play with the other kids?&quot; I ask.
       
&quot;...I don&#39;t play with the other kids,&quot; he responds.
       
&quot;Why not?&quot;
       
My conversation doesn&#39;t seem to be going anywhere, but for some reason,
I feel compelled to speak with the child regardless.  I don&#39;t know 
where this obligation is coming from, but I feel like it&#39;s my 
responsibility to ask him about his well being.
       
&quot;...they all think I&#39;m stupid,&quot; he answers.
       
&quot;Now don&#39;t say that,&quot; I find myself already trying to comfort the 
child, &quot;you&#39;re not stupid.  Maybe they&#39;re just shy.&quot;
       
&quot;That&#39;s not why, all the other kids laugh at me,&quot; the boy continues.  
&quot;They say I&#39;m weird, and that I&#39;m different from everyone else.  Why am
I different, I&#39;m a kid just like they are, why don&#39;t they want to play 
with me?&quot;
       
&quot;Never mind them,&quot; I try to assure the boy, &quot;they&#39;re just jealous of 
you because you&#39;re special,&quot; I find myself lying again.
       
&quot;How am I special?&quot;
       
&quot;Well..., uh..., everyone&#39;s special in their own way,&quot; I remember what 
chaos had said once, &quot;you just have to figure out what it is that makes
you so.&quot;
       
&quot;How do I do that?&quot;
       
&quot;You have to find that out by yourself I&#39;m afraid.&quot;
       
&quot;Ha ha, you&#39;re funny,&quot; the child gives a small chuckle.  &quot;You&#39;re the 
only person except for Mr. Jin and Miss Yui that&#39;s talked to me.  
What&#39;s your name?&quot;
       
&quot;KOS-MOS,&quot; I respond.
       
&quot;That&#39;s a funny name,&quot; the child laughs again, &quot;what&#39;s your real name?&quot;
       
Should I give him my real name?  The only people to ever call me by 
real name were Shion and my sister.  Well, I suppose I can give it to 
him, for some reason I feel a bit more comfortable being called by it.
       
&quot;...Elly,&quot; I answer, &quot;my name is Elly, what&#39;s your name?&quot;
       
&quot;Abel,&quot; the boy responds.
       
&#39;Abel, where have I heard that name before?&#39; I ask myself in my head.
       
I don&#39;t ever recall meeting this boy, it&#39;s only been a month since I 
was activated, three days since I became human.  Someone mentioned the 
name to me before, but when?  Abel&#39;s Ark, yes, I&#39;m sure that&#39;s where I 
heard the name, it was part of my mission objectives.  An uneasy 
feeling passes through my being now, I know this is just a child 
sitting before me, but something&#39;s telling me there&#39;s something more to
him, to this &quot;Abel.&quot;
       
&quot;Hey Elly, can I tell you a secret?&quot; the child&#39;s voice suddenly 
interrupts my thoughts.
       
&quot;Huh?&quot; I snap back to reality.
       
&quot;Can I tell you a secret?&quot; the child repeats himself.
       
&quot;All right,&quot; I nod.
       
&quot;Promise not to tell anyone?&quot;
       
&quot;I promise.&quot;
       
&quot;Really?  Cross your heart hope to die?  Stick a needle through your 
eye?&quot;
       
&quot;Yes, I promise I won&#39;t tell anyone,&quot; I assure him.
       
The boy begins to stack the blocks before him again, placing one large 
one as a base and piling a smaller one on top in a vertical fashion.  
He then takes a third block, one larger than the base and proceeds to 
place it on top of the second.  For some reason his hand stops three 
inches above the second block, as if the block would hold in place in 
the air.  Slowly he releases the toy from his grasp and I wait for it 
to fall.  For some reason it doesn&#39;t fall, the block remains floating 
in the air where his hand had placed it, leaving me in awe.  He takes a
fourth block now into his hand, this one he places to the left of the 
previous block, again with no support underneath and it also remains in 
place.  This must be an illusion I&#39;m seeing, or at least that&#39;s what I 
would like to believe.  I run my hand through the space beneath the 
blocks and find nothing underneath, no strings or anything holding the 
toys in place.  I quickly move my hand away after as all of the blocks 
begin to move suddenly, slowly twirling in a circular motion.  Again my
breath is short upon witnessing this sight, but before I know it, each 
of the blocks fall to the floor and Abel is left laughing at my facial 
expression.
       
&quot;Well what do you think, pretty cool, huh?&quot; the boy says.
       
&quot;How...how did you do that?&quot; I ask still dumbstruck on the events that
just occurred.
       
&quot;I dunno, it&#39;s just something I can do,&quot; the boy answers, &quot;you can do 
it too you know.&quot;
       
&quot;What?&quot;
       
&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you for a long time,&quot; a voice suddenly enters my
head.
       
&#39;Waiting, for me?&#39; I ask in my mind.  &#39;Who are you?&#39;
       
&quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for someone like you, waiting just for you, 
Mother...&quot;
       
&#39;Mother...?&#39;
       
&quot;KOS-MOS, is this a new friend of yours?&quot; a voice from reality 
interrupts.
       
I turn around and find the silver-haired boy standing behind me, his 
usual smile stretched across his face.  I wait another second for a 
response from the voice that was speaking to me just a second ago, but 
I get nothing.  Must&#39;ve been my imagination, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just normal 
for people to hear voices in their head.
       
&quot;Hi little guy,&quot; the silver-haired boy takes a seat beside Abel, &quot;my 
name&#39;s chaos, what&#39;s your name?&quot;
       
&quot;Abel.&quot;
       
&quot;That&#39;s a nice name,&quot; chaos compliments.
       
&quot;Elly, chaos, are you ready to go?&quot; my lover calls from the other side 
of the room.
       
&quot;Yeah, just about,&quot; I call back.
       
&quot;Well I&#39;m afraid we have to get going now,&quot; chaos tells the boy.
       
&quot;Awww, already?&quot; the child whines.
       
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll come back another day,&quot; the chaos assures him.
       
&quot;Really?  Will you come back too, Elly?&quot; Abel asks me, tugging at my 
arm.
       
&quot;I will,&quot; I tell the boy.
       
&quot;Really?&quot;
       &quot;
Yes, really.&quot;
       
&quot;Really really?&quot;
       
&quot;Now Abel, let&#39;s not keep Mr. chaos and Miss KOS-MOS any longer,&quot; Jin 
starts to enter the conversation.
       
&quot;But Mr. Jin...!&quot; the child moans.
       
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I promise they&#39;ll come back another day, in fact, I&#39;ll 
try to bring them back next time,&quot; Jin assures him.
       
&quot;All right,&quot; the child grumbles, &quot;you better keep your promise!&quot;
       
&quot;I always do,&quot; Jin chuckles.  &quot;Well then, shall we get going?&quot; he turns
his attention toward us.
       
&quot;Mm-hm,&quot; I nod.
       
&quot;Bye Elly!  Bye chaos!&quot; the child calls as we make our way out the 
door.
       
We walk outside the orphanage afterward where the others await.  Shion 
already has annoyed look on her face the moment she sees her brother 
and I prepare to have them get into another argument.
       
&quot;Jin, that took longer than &#39;just a second,&#39;&quot; she scolds her brother, 
&quot;do you realize what else could&#39;ve happened to the Director while we 
were dawdling here?&quot;
       
&quot;It&#39;s not like you to complain about coming to the orphanage,&quot; Jin says
calmly, &quot;I thought you like children?&quot;
       
&quot;I do, but that&#39;s not the point, the Director&#39;s life is probably in 
danger and here we are...&quot;
       
&quot;Well why didn&#39;t you just go to the Second Division yourself then?&quot;
       
&quot;I can&#39;t exactly go without Elly, the Director mentioned her in his 
orders, or at least I think he did, and I can&#39;t just...&quot;
       
I begin to tune out of their argument once more, looking back into the 
orphanage.  That young boy, Abel, why did I feel so unsettled when I 
spoke with him?  Unsettled, but at the same time, relaxed.  I was in 
such an awe when we spoke, not just because of the blocks, but because 
of something else, something I can&#39;t describe.  Part of me was just
happy to sit there with him, but I&#39;m not sure why.  Then there was that
voice I heard before chaos joined in, I think it called me &quot;Mother,&quot; 
but why is that so?
       
&quot;Chief, I hate to break this up, but shouldn&#39;t we be heading to the 
Second Division now that your brother&#39;s got his schedule,&quot; Allen 
finally breaks up their argument.
       
&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Shion nods, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;ve been wasting even 
more time by arguing with my brother here.  At any rate, we should call
a cab and get to the Second Division as soon as possible.&quot;
       
&quot;If that&#39;s the case, MOMO and I had better get to the UMN Committee&#39;s 
Central HQ,&quot; Ziggy informs us, &quot;I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ve spent too much time 
here already.&quot;
       
&quot;Always a stickler for schedules, aren&#39;t you, cyborg,&quot; my attention 
then shifts to the Durandal&#39;s young captain.  &quot;Is this how it always is
before you get a job done, do you really think getting to the UMN 
sooner is gonna effect the performance of your job?&quot; he says with a 
sliver of anger in his voice.
       
&quot;Jr...?&quot; the young realian looks at him with a worried expression on 
her face.
       
&quot;Time is always of the essence,&quot; the cyborg responds in his usual 
stoic tone, &quot;we&#39;ve already spent more than enough time to return MOMO and...&quot;
       
&quot;Is your paycheck the only thing you care about?!&quot; Jr. continues, 
raising his voice as loud as ever.  &quot;You just wanna dump her off so you
can get to your next job, is that it, you&#39;re just gonna leave her like 
that?!&quot;
       
&quot;Though I dislike your way of words, that describes the situation 
rather well.&quot;
       
&quot;You son of a...!&quot; the young captain&#39;s fist suddenly launches forward.
       
&quot;Jr.! Ziggy!  Stop it!&quot; the young realian screams.  &quot;Jr., please calm 
down, Ziggy&#39;s only doing his job, and...&quot;
       
&quot;Only doing his job, how can you say that, MOMO?!&quot; Jr. turns his anger 
to the young girl now.  &quot;Don&#39;t you see what&#39;s going on here, he doesn&#39;t
care about how you&#39;re feeling right now, he just wants to drop you off 
like that and be on his way!  I know that&#39;s not what you want, MOMO, 
so...&quot;
       
&quot;Ziggy&#39;s already done more than enough letting me stay with at the 
Uzuki Residence for the past few days,&quot; MOMO interrupts him, &quot;he&#39;s 
already gone more than out of his way to allow me to do so.  Ziggy&#39;s 
job was only to escort me to the UMN Committee&#39;s Central HQ, that&#39;s 
all, he didn&#39;t have to do anything else.&quot;
       
&quot;But...how could you defend someone like him?!&quot;
       
&quot;I hate to end things on a sour note, but I have to take MOMO to the 
UMN Committee&#39;s Central HQ now,&quot; the cyborg says as he takes MOMO&#39;s 
hand.
       
&quot;Hold it!&quot; Jr.&#39;s voice stops him once more.  &quot;I&#39;m going too, there&#39;s no
way I&#39;m gonna let you off that easy!&quot;
       
&quot;Jr., stop it!&quot; my lover intervenes now.  &quot;Ziggy&#39;s just doing his job, 
you needn&#39;t be angry at him for it.  If you&#39;re going to go with them, I
should go as well to make sure...&quot;
       
&quot;What, but Chief, what about the Director?&quot; Allen reminds her.
       
&quot;...Shoot!&quot; Shion remembers.  &quot;But I can&#39;t just let the two of them go 
off like this.&quot;
       
&quot;I&#39;ll go,&quot; chaos volunteers.  &quot;The UMN Committee&#39;s Central HQ is close 
to the ship auto shop, the captain wanted me to place an order there, 
so I might as well go with them since it&#39;s on the way.&quot;
       
&quot;Are you sure, chaos?&quot; my lover asks.
       
&quot;Yeah, you have your own worries, let me take care of them, I&#39;ll make 
sure nothing else happens,&quot; chaos assures her.
       
&quot;All right, we&#39;re counting on you then,&quot; Shion tells him.
       
&quot;Taxi!&quot; Jin whistles afterward causing a yellow-colored car to suddenly
stop by us.  &quot;Well if any of you are ever in the neighborhood again, 
please, don&#39;t hesitate to drop by.  MOMO, Ziggy, Jr., chaos, please 
take care.&quot;
       
&quot;Yeah, thanks for everything,&quot; Allen says as he follows Jin into the 
car.
       
&quot;Well I hope we can all talk again soon,&quot; Shion says as she makes her 
way into the taxi after.  &quot;Elly, you say something too.&quot;
       
&quot;I&#39;m not sure how to say goodbyes,&quot; I find myself suddenly scratching 
an itch behind my neck.
       
&quot;Just goodbye is fine,&quot; chaos tells me.
       
&quot;We&#39;ll see you all later!&quot; MOMO calls as I find my way into the back 
seat.
       
The moment the doors close in the car, I find myself looking through 
the back window of the car to see the images of my friends shrinking.  
I find my eyes beginning to water now, and my nose beginning to 
sniffle.  My mind then begins to shift toward the past, reminding me of
the time they invited me to eat with them for breakfast, when we went 
to the beach, and when we sang karaoke.  Saying goodbye, who knew it 
could hurt so much.
       
&quot;Are you all right, Elly?&quot; I turn to the seat beside me to find Shion 
in the same manner.
       
&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; I try to answer, wiping away some of the rivers away from 
my face.
       
&quot;We&#39;ll meet them again,&quot; my lover assures me, &quot;I know we will.&quot;
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
(Jr.&#39;s POV)
  
       
That lousy cyborg, who does he think he is?  To think that he used to 
be a human being, I bet he was as cold and detached as he was back then
as he is now.
       
I look out the window of the car we rented, the sunlight glimmering off
each of the buildings&#39; windows that we pass.  The view of the city 
looks the same as it always does when I come here, but the emotions 
running through me are different.  MOMO, we&#39;ve only known each other 
for about a month, but I feel so...attached to her.  Her sakura pink 
hair, her gold yellow eyes, and her bright smile, for some reason, each
of these features and her actual self remind me of &quot;her.&quot;
       
&quot;Is something wrong, Jr.?&quot; the mentioned girl&#39;s voice now breaks me out
of my thoughts.
       
&quot;No, I&#39;m all right,&quot; I lie, trying my best to give her my usual smile.
       
&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear it,&quot; she returns the smile.
       
&quot;We&#39;ll be arriving at the UMN Committee&#39;s Central HQ momentarily,&quot; the
cyborg informs us from the driver&#39;s seat.
       
The way he talks, so calm and cool, no, more like monotone.  Just 
hearing his voice makes my blood boil.  Cyborg, hah, that doesn&#39;t even 
come close to describing him, robot is a more appropriate term, even 
cyborgs revert back to their human emotions every once and a while.
       
&quot;Hm?&quot; I turn to chaos who slightly stands from his seat.
       
&quot;chaos?&quot; MOMO turns next to him.
       
&quot;Everyone, get down!&quot; he suddenly orders.
       
The air around the car begins to roar suddenly and tremors begin to 
wobble it off course.  The roaring grows louder and louder, and before 
any of us know it, the windows begin to crack.  The glass breaks 
furiously in the blink of an eye, the ceiling of the car suddenly 
hurled towards the road we just past, all of this happening in a 
second.  The wind begins to sting against our faces now, all of us 
keeping our eyes open through slits.  The roaring grows louder now as a
dull shimmer of light now rains down from above.
       
&quot;Pull over, immediately,&quot; a female voice echoes from the source of 
floating metal, &quot;hand over the 100-Series Observational Realian 
Prototype, if you do not comply, we will attack.&quot;
       
I look further into the sky now to find a dark-colored machine hovering
above us.  It&#39;s an A.G.W.S. unit, a model I&#39;ve never seen before.  This
machine is bigger than other A.G.W.S. units though, this one is 
practically as big as a three-story building.  Several pieces of black 
metal protrude from its back, giving the impression of a cape as a 
spear of the same color and shape as the back is carried in its right 
hand.  Eyes of yellow glow from its skull, the eyes themselves looking 
down upon us as if the machine was laughing maniacally.  Two more 
A.G.W.S. units hover beside it, these ones standard VX-5000 units.
       
&quot;I repeat, hand over the 100-Series Observational Realian Prototype, if
you do not comply, we will attack,&quot; the voice orders.
       
&quot;Pellegri...,&quot; I turn to chaos who begins to make a fist.
       
&quot;Like hell we&#39;ll hand her over to you!&quot;
       
I draw my twin pistols at this point, quickly taking aim at the giant 
A.G.W.S. unit.  The one in my right hand pulls back the moment I pull 
the trigger, the one in left recoiling in the same manner after.  The 
car suddenly begins to pick up speed now, causing me to nearly lose my 
balance.  I turn to the cyborg for a second to see him still wearing 
that monotone expression on his face, as if he were driving normally.  
The car begins to bob and weave between other vehicles on the road now,
the giant machines still hovering above us as they mimic our actions.  
I finally get back my balance a few seconds later, this time pointing 
each gun at a different A.G.W.S.  Blam, blam, each of the bullets hits 
their mark, yet they seem to do nothing but put a small scratch on 
their armor.  Again the car begins to take cover with the rest of the 
traffic, but this time I don&#39;t lose my balance, merely losing my aim.
       
&quot;Your resistance is futile, hand over the Realian and your fates won&#39;t 
be as bleak,&quot; the woman in the giant A.G.W.S. orders again.
       
&quot;We heard you the first time and nothing&#39;s changed!&quot; I scream at the 
top of my lungs, bringing another shot to the machine.
       
&quot;So be it.&quot;
       
The weapon in the giant machine&#39;s hand pulls toward the ground now, 
causing the entire road to tremble.  The car jumps off the road for a 
mere second, the front of the car meeting with the ground first before 
resuming its path.  Another tremor follows shortly after, this one more
violent than the last.  My ordinary pistols aren&#39;t going to work, so I 
decide to switch to my energy one.  I take out the battery clip the 
moment I get it out of my jacket, only 3 shots left according to the 
reading on the battery, I have to make each one count.
       
&quot;We&#39;ve got trouble,&quot; the cyborg informs us suddenly.
       
I turn to the front of the road now and find a bridge in our direction.
More A.G.W.S. units now appear in the bridge&#39;s direction, all of them 
coming to a stop at its entrance.  The roaring of more engines now 
grows louder in my ears and I find two more A.G.W.S. beside us, one on 
each side.
       
&quot;Got any bright ideas, cyborg?&quot; I ask.
       
&quot;Sorry, none.&quot;
       
&quot;Dammit!&quot;
       
I look to the seat beside me and find MOMO huddled to the floor with 
chaos holding her.  The look in both of their eyes, they know there&#39;s 
no way out of this.  The car&#39;s breaks begin to screech now, our speed 
quickly dropping.  The smell of burning rubber flows into our nostrils 
the moment our ride comes to a halt, our path blocked from all sides 
from different A.G.W.S. units.  The cyborg gets out of his seat now, 
and exits the vehicle.  chaos proceeds to do the same, but Ziggy stops 
him with the signal of his hand.
       
&quot;I&#39;ll do my best to distract them,&quot; he informs us, &quot;during that time, 
take MOMO to the UMN.  Is that understood?&quot;
       
&quot;But Ziggy...!&quot; MOMO tries to protest.
       
&quot;How noble of a relic of the past,&quot; the giant A.G.W.S. lands in front 
of us now, &quot;it&#39;s too bad your plan will fail to succeed.  How long do 
you think you can keep all of our forces busy?  One minute, two?  Even 
if you were to keep us busy, that doesn&#39;t mean our reinforcements 
aren&#39;t heading in this direction.  We&#39;re not letting the realian slip
from our grasp this time.&quot;
       
I look back to the other side of the bridge and find specks hovering in
the sky, these specks growing bigger with every second.  She wasn&#39;t 
kidding, reinforcements are already heading this way.
       
&quot;You lose,&quot; the woman in the machine says, &quot;game over.&quot;
       
&quot;Dammit, I can&#39;t let it end like this!&quot; I grumble, despite knowing that
we&#39;ve lost.

cbman&#39;s Note: A cliffhanger already, yeah I couldn&#39;t help it.  In any 
case I hope you liked this first chapter, sorry about the pacing being 
slow and awkward, but I assure you the pacing will be better for the 
rest of the fic.  Reviews are welcome, but no flames as usual.  Yeah, I
know the chase scene at the end was different in Xenosaga Episode 2, 
but hey, I said this was an AU after all, so things are definitely 
going to be different than the game.  Well that&#39;s it for now, I hope 
you look forward to later chapters of this fic.  Later people!
