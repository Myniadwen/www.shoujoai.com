<h1>Tears of Toys (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/albedoright.html">Albedo's right hand</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/teartoy-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>     That night Momo walked into the park of the Durandle searching the 
room with her scanners in hopes that she wouldn&#39;t be here. With a sigh 
of relief she walked forward, her boots making almost no sound on the 
cold hard floor.
     She reached the bench she always sat at and looked sadly into the 
abyss in front of her before sitting down. She hung her head down and 
all the memories of the past four days flooded into her head.
     She cared so much for Jr. but he only wanted her because she 
resembled the girl he fell in love with. Even the first kiss felt 
strange as she thought back to it. How his kiss felt rough and he felt 
his tongue pierce into his mouth. After the kiss he had a distant look 
in his eyes, at first she thought it was just love but she knew now it 
was the image of Sakura.
     Even that night just before they broke up, when she gave herself to 
him feeling like she really could trust him. That wonderful time when he 
held her in his arms made her feel complete. When he gave her sensations 
she never knew she could feel and he called out Her name. 
     She remembered how she grabbed her clothes and got dressed before 
she ran out of the room crying. How he tried to come up with an excuse 
but it just came out as him stammering. S	She thought about how she 
came here and cried all night long. She remembered every tear that 
flowed from her eyes. She remembered the sound of her own sobs ringing 
through the room. She remembered how she thought of her body and how 
filthy it felt. She remembered how her sensors detected only one other 
person. 
	That then brought about the image of KOS-MOS. That blue haired 
android that watched her as she cried herself to sleep on a park bench 
for three nights. She thought about the android and wondered about her 
own feelings. She also wondered that if she fell in love with KOS-MOS 
would that simply mean she was looking for someone to replace the hole 
in her wounded heart.
	Then her mind came across an image of her creator from before she 
was fully functional. She wondered about him and wished she had known 
him for a longer amount of time.
	&quot;Oh daddy. Would you have approved of me if I fell in love with 
KOS-MOS?&quot; her head rose and she looked out the large window. She 
seriously considered if she could live that way. She then spoke meekly 
to herself.
	&quot;Would I be making her take JR&#39;s place? Would people think that?&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t think people would think that way.&quot; Came a nearby voice.
	&quot;C...chaos! When did you get here?&quot; She asked reviewing her sensor 
logs for any evidence of his presence over the last five minutes. 
	&quot;I was over at that bench since before you came in.&quot; He said in 
his soft voice as he sat down beside her. He looked over her sensor data 
and like always the mysterious boy confused her sensors. &quot;You look 
upset, is it about KOS-MOS?&quot;
	&quot;Yes it is, but how would you know?&quot; She asked wiping her moist 
cheeks with her sleeve.
	&quot;Last night I couldn&#39;t sleep so I decided to take a walk through 
the Durandle. When I reached the park I found KOS-MOS crying at this 
very bench. When I asked her what happened she told me everything.&quot; He 
calmly replied. Momo looked out the window,
	&quot;Would the others think I was using her If...&quot; She trailed off 
hanging her head back down.
	&quot;Like I said earlier, as long as it is truly out of love then they 
will understand.&quot; He replied putting his hand on her shoulder.
	&quot;Does KOS-MOS...really love me? She asked quietly.
	&quot;Yes. She is still understanding her newfound emotions but she 
quite obviously loves you.&quot; Momo then asked,
	&quot;chaos...do you think Daddy would approve of me being with an 
android? I mean the whole concept of humans with realians is still 
looked down on, what about a realian and an android?&quot; 
	&quot;Just follow your heart Momo, that is all that truly matters.&quot; 
Momo stood up and gazed out the large window as if to look for 
something.
	&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have run from her last night. I hope she can forgive 
me.&quot; chaos gave a soft smile,
	&quot;I am sure she would understand.&quot; She turned to the door and said,
	&quot;Did they move KOS-MOS&#39;s recharge station yet?&quot; choas thought for 
a second,
	&quot;No, that is scheduled a week from now, but why?&quot; Momo gave a kind 
smile.
	&quot;I need to give her my apologizes.&quot; She ran off, leaving chaos to 
sit and watch the stars. Chaos turned his head and playfully smirked at 
nephilim, who just floated there with a stupefied look on her face. He 
was about to say something but Momo could be heard running back into the 
park.
	Nephilim vanished and chaos lost his smirk. Momo ran right up to 
chaos and asked,
	&quot;When you said she is still trying to understand her 
emotions...well...&quot; She trailed off sheepishly,
	&quot;Yes, what is it?&quot; Momo blushed and leaned over to whisper into 
his ear,
	&quot;Well yes. I guess she could...but it would probably be a question 
to ask Shion, not me.&quot; He said thinking
	&quot;Thanks anyway.&quot; She ran back off and Nephilim reappeared 
closeby...with her jaw hanging loose.

	The room was dark and not a sound could be heard. A door silently 
opened as a dark figure tiptoed into the room with a box under one arm. 
The figure walked through the office silently and was about to place the 
box on the desk when the lights were flicked on.
	Gaignun was now face to face with Jr. sitting at his desk with a 
sour look on his face.
	&quot;What the hell do you think your doing sneaking into my office at 
this time of night?&quot; Jr. asked, his voice dripping acid.
	&quot;Well. Some one is snippy tonight.&quot; Gaignun shot back, letting the 
box drop an inch onto the desk. The gentle rattle from inside rang 
through the whole room.
	&quot;What&#39;s in the box?&quot; Jr. asked still quite agitated.
	&quot;It is you birthday gift for tomorrow.&quot; Gaignun replied.
	&quot;I&#39;d rather not be reminded of my creator every single year.&quot; Jr. 
said recalling memories that they both shared. Gaignun picked up the box 
and put it under his arm.
	&quot;Fine. Besides if you got it now you would probably shoot me with 
how aggressive your being.&quot;
	&quot;Shut up Gaignun! I am not in the mode for this.&quot; Jr. snapped at 
Gaignun.
	&quot;That was one of the things I have been meaning to ask you.&quot; He 
said putting the box on a nearby table and slipping his hands into his 
pockets.
	&quot;Did you say something to Momo, my security cams have seen some 
very strange sights.&quot; Jr. had a look of disgust,
	&quot;You have some strange hobbies Gaignun. Well, you see It was 
something I said to her but...&quot; He trailed off but at that moment the 
image was sent to Gaignun.
	&quot;You said WHAT?! While doing WHAT?!&quot; Gaignun face-palmed while 
shaking his head.
	&quot;No wonder she is so heart broken when you...&quot;
	&quot;SHUT UP GAIGNUN!&quot; Jr. yelled out. &quot;All this time I have been 
living a lie! I know that now!&quot;
	&quot;Fourteen years...and you still can&#39;t forgive yourself.&quot; Gaignun 
calmly said. Jr. leaned back in his chair and looked at the tiled 
ceiling.
	 &quot;I never loved Momo...I only saw Sakura when I looked into her 
eyes. Everything I did were things I never could with Sakura.&quot;
	&quot;It reminds me of the time I went out with Bonny...now look at 
her. She is a waiter at a bar and head of the Mary and Shelly fan-club.&quot; 
Gaignun said with the look of pain in his voice.
	&quot;You&#39;re an Idiot Gaignun. I loved Sakura...then I went and did it 
with her realian sisters...I mean sister. How do you think I feel!&quot; 
Gaignun rolled his eyes at the remark.
	&quot;I wonder if all the U.R.T.V s were this messed up? Oh well, I am 
leaving before this becomes some man to boy discussion about birds and 
the bees.&quot; Gaignun said with a laugh and grabbed the box.
	&quot;Oh really? I thought you would scold me, or at least try to cheer 
me up.&quot; Gaignun opened the door and said,
	&quot;Your older than me, what help could your younger brother be.&quot; 
Gaignun vanished down the hallway and Jr. spat at the joke the black 
haired U.R.T.V used to often. He slammed his fist into the desk.
	&quot;Stupid Mizrahi! Why the hell did you have to make her look like 
Sakura, Damn you!&quot;
