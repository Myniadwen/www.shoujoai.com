<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cbman.html">cbman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/mother-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>cbman&#146;s Note: Sorry about the long wait, but there&#146;s been a lot of 
junk that&#146;s been happening in my personal life these past few months, 
namely school, work, and the fact that my computer&#146;s a piece of junk.  
In any case, let me remind you that things would will be different from
the original episode 2, and this chapter is no exception either.  
Another character enters the scene in this chapter, Xenogears fans will
immediately recognize her when her name is mentioned.  Well enough with
the small talk, let&#146;s get to the story.

Shi&#39;s Note: Well, I guess I should put in my two cents worth of 
talking, eh? I&#39;ve been around this place for a while, for those of you 
who actually remember me as LadyShinigami, StormGuardian, or whatever 
else name I came up with. I&#39;ve been hanging around this XenoMark/cbman
for a while and I gotta admit, he&#39;s awesome. Anyways, as I&#39;ve got 
nothing more to say here really, lets drop to the story.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(Shion&#146;s POV)

Vector&#146;s Second R &amp; D Division, after staying home for three days, 
Elly, Allen, and I have finally decided to come here.  The last time I 
was here was two years ago I believe; it was to oversee the production 
of Miang&#146;s, the Archetype KOS-MOS, second armament.  At the time, Miang
was in the final phase of being completed, a month before she was 
activated and went berserk.  To be honest I never did like going here, 
to the Second Division, maybe it was because of all the weapons that 
were built here; the division seemed a lot more like a weapons facility
or military base than a laboratory.  Today however, I do not feel 
uneasy because of that fact, I feel uneasy because of what may have 
happened to the Director, but not only that, I may also have to turn 
Elly in for her secondary equipment.
	
I turn to the seat beside me and find the blue-haired angel staring out
the window, her face wearing an expression of sorrow.  It amazes me 
when I think back at how fast my little girl grew up in the last month,
from a monotone and emotionless android to a emotional woman full of 
life.  In the last week alone she&#146;s shown me more expressions than when
she ever did when she was first activated; sadness, loneliness, 
concern, happiness, love, she never was able to comprehend what these 
things were until recently.
	
The taxi cab comes to a stop now, stopping before twin structures with 
a large open area between.  It is impossible to see the top of the 
structures, I feel as if I&#146;d fall down attempting to.  We all make our 
way out of the car now, Jin paying the driver&#146;s fee before shortly 
joining us at the entrance.  The way things look on the outside, it 
looks as if nothing happened.  The images I saw during my conversation 
with the Director, did they only pertain to his office?  I have to see 
for myself now.
	
&#147;What&#146;s your business here?&#148; the security guard stops us at the front 
gate.
	
&#147;My name is Shion Uzuki, I&#146;m the Chief Engineer of the KOS-MOS Project 
by Vector&#146;s First R &amp; D Division,&#148; I show him my job ID, &#147;I&#146;m here to 
give a report to the Director.&#148;
	
&#147;Go on through,&#148; the guard opens the gate for us.
	
Without wasting another second, I take everyone to the east tower where
the Director&#146;s Office is located.  Luckily there is an elevator waiting
for us the moment we enter the first hall, allowing us to get to his 
office more quickly.  Silence is the only thing I hear as we go up the 
floors, that is, until my idiot brother decides to break it.
	
&#147;Is my sister always like this?&#148; I overhear Jin whisper to Allen.
	
&#147;Yeah, whenever she has to go in to meet the director, she always gets 
so tense that...&#148;
	
&#147;I can hear you!&#148; I fume.
	
&#147;I see your point,&#148; Jin tells Allen.
	
&#147;What&#146;s that supposed to mean, Jin?!&#148; I yell at my brother.  &#147;Allen, 
what do you mean I get so tense whenever I have to go in to meet the 
director?&#148; I turn my attention to him after.  &#147;If you have something to
say about me, then say it now!&#148;
	
&#147;Chief, it&#146;s not like I mean to disrespect you or anything,&#148; my 
co-worker says nervously, &#147;it&#146;s just that well...&#148;
	
&#147;Well what?!&#148;
	
&#147;Shion, please calm down,&#148; I suddenly find my hand wrapped around 
another.  &#147;I know you&#146;re upset about what you saw over the phone, but 
please, don&#146;t take your frustration out on Jin and Allen.&#148;
	
&#147;You&#146;re right,&#148; I find myself beginning to calm down, &#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;
	
&#147;No, it&#146;s okay, Chief, you must have a lot to worry about, not just the
Director, but having to turn KOS-MOS in to the Second Division, it must
be hard having to...&#148;
	
&#147;Of course it&#146;s hard!&#148; I find myself raising my voice once more.  &#147;I 
mean,&#148; I try to calm myself down once more, &#147;I don&#146;t want to turn Elly 
in to the Second Division after all that&#146;s happened to her recently.&#148;
	
&#147;Is that the only reason?&#148; Jin asks as he folds his arms to his chest.
	
&#147;No, it isn&#146;t,&#148; I shake my head, &#147;if I had it my way, I would never 
turn Elly in to them.&#148;
	
&#147;Don&#146;t worry so much, Shion,&#148; Elly tries to assure me, &#147;do you think 
they would even still want me now that I&#146;m no longer an android.  I&#146;m 
just an ordinary woman now, what could they possibly want with me?&#148;
	
&#147;I suppose you&#146;re right, Elly,&#148; I lie.
	
I know things aren&#146;t going to be that easy.  Even if what I saw happen 
to the Director wasn&#146;t true and is still okay, he would still order me 
to turn Elly in to the Second Division.  The Director may be a patient 
man, but even if I were to explain the events that happened in the past
few days, I doubt he would even believe me.  The story about Elly&#146;s 
dormant sister, Miang, resurfacing after all these years and trying to 
take over her body would sound ridiculous to most people, even more so 
when I tell him that it was her violent actions that turned Elly into a
human being.  Still, I should try to convince him..
	
&#147;You&#146;re late, Ms. Uzuki,&#148; a voice greets us the moment the elevator 
door is opened.
	
I expect to see the Director on the other side, but instead we are 
greeted by a different individual.  The voice that was spoken, it was 
not the Director&#146;s, but it was a familiar voice nonetheless.  The doors
fully open now and we find a rather well-dressed individual standing 
before us.  He wears a finely-made suit, one that doesn&#146;t have a fold 
or loose thread.  His hair is well-groomed, his white hair not going 
past his skull, but two long curly bangs hang down the front but don&#146;t 
cover his face whatsoever.  His eyes are of a red shade, his pupils 
giving the impression of tranquility.  His skin is as pale as a ghost, 
the same color of his hair, yet there is not a smudge nor scratch on 
the surface.  His appearance and demeanor remind me of someone, but 
who?  chaos?  No, that can&#146;t be, they look nothing alike, and yet...
	
&#147;S...Sir Wilhelm, CEO of Vector Industries!&#148; I turn to my side to find 
Allen quickly bowing to the individual.
	
&#147;Sir Wilhelm?!&#148; I finally realize who the man standing before us is.  
&#147;Oh my gosh, it is quite an honor to meet you, sir!&#148; I quickly bow as 
well.
	
So that&#146;s who this man is, Sir Wilhelm, the CEO of Vector.  I have 
never met this man in person until now, I had only seen him in galas 
and company meetings, but I never had the chance to speak with him.  To
have the CEO of our company personally meet us is quite an honor, he 
hardly visits the lower divisions of the company, much less any of its 
employees.
	
&#147;No, the honor is quite mine,&#148; the man bows as well.  &#147;Please, there is
no need to be so formal with me, Mr. Ridgeley, Ms. Uzuki, and...,&#148; he 
stops as he turns to my brother and Elly.
	
&#147;Uzuki,&#148; Jin bows, &#147;Jin Uzuki, I&#146;m Shion&#146;s older brother.&#148;
	
&#147;Escorting your sister to work I see,&#148; the CEO says with a slight 
chuckle, &#147;I didn&#146;t think there were siblings like you that were still 
around.&#148;
	
&#147;Well if I don&#146;t do it, who knows what kind of trouble she&#146;d get into,&#148;
my brother remarks as I try my best not to lose my temper in Sir 
Wilhelm&#146;s presence.
	
&#147;And you must be the android that Ms. Uzuki was creating for the last 
two years,&#148; Sir Wilhelm then turns his attention to Elly.  &#147;KP-X, 
abbreviated name &#145;KOS-MOS,&#146; serial number 00-00-00-00-1, correct?&#148;
	
&#147;That&#146;s what some people call me,&#148; Elly says uneasily.  &#147;To be honest, 
I don&#146;t really like that name,&#148; she continues.
	
&#147;Then you have another name you would like to go by?&#148;
	
&#147;Elly,&#148; my lover answers, &#147;Shion has named me &#145;Elly.&#146;&#148;
	
&#147;Very well then, Miss Elly,&#148; Sir Wilhelm corrects himself.
	
&#147;Um sir, there was a reason as to why we came in today,&#148; I tell him, 
&#147;you see, when I received a call from the Director this morning...&#148;
	
&#147;About that,&#148; Sir Wilhelm interrupts, &#147;the Director signed a letter of 
resignation today.&#148;
	
&#147;What?&#148;
	
&#147;I received the letter this morning, the reason was &#145;family 
difficulties,&#146;&#148; the CEO informs me.
	
&#147;That can&#146;t be,&#148; I tell him, &#147;when I spoke with him over the phone...&#148;
	
&#147;Ugh...,&#148; I turn to my side to find my lover suddenly pushing her palm 
against her forehead.
	
&#147;Elly, what&#146;s wrong?&#148; I quickly turn my attention to her.
	
&#147;My head hurts...,&#148; she answers.
	
&#147;A fever maybe,&#148; I bring her temple to mine for a moment, &#147;no, you&#146;re 
not burning up...&#148;
	
&#147;In any case Ms. Uzuki, in the Director&#146;s place, I would like you to 
turn KOS-MOS in to the Second Division now,&#148; Sir Wilhelm orders.
	
&#147;What, but Sir, Elly isn&#146;t...&#148;
	
&#147;Feeling well?  Ms. Uzuki, she is an android, how could a machine not 
feel well and...&#148;
	
&#147;But she&#146;s not a machine!&#148; I interrupt him.  &#147;She&#146;s human being, just 
like you and me, so please, don&#146;t label her as such.&#148;
	
&#147;So then this isn&#146;t the KOS-MOS unit you have been building up to this 
point?&#148; he asks.
	
&#147;Yes and no, Sir, you see...&#148;
	
&#147;Ah!&#148; my lover now falls to her knees, her palms pushing into her 
forehead further.
	
&#147;Elly!&#148;
	
&#147;I&#146;ll have our men look into this; in the meantime, Ms. Hawwa,&#148; he 
calls to the other side of the room.
	
&#147;Sir?&#148;
	
A woman steps forward now, her entire body clothed in a dull gray 
security outfit.  She wears not a speck of make up on her face as 
company protocol dictates, though she doesn&#146;t seem to show any 
individuality whatsoever on her clothing.  No necklaces, bracelets, or 
rings, nor does she allow her hair to be free from the security cap.  
Her eyes are not in view either, her pupils covered by the bill of her 
cap.  The only skin she shows are on her hands and face, all of which 
are a creamy milk white.  I find myself shivering for some reason as I 
look at her, afraid of her aura, yet for some reason, another part of 
me feels relaxed.  She seems so calm, so cool, so...emotionless.  She 
begins to approach us now, taking to Sir Wilhelm&#146;s side.
	
&#147;Please take the KOS-MOS unit to Laboratory 202, room 6,&#148; Sir Wilhelm 
orders the woman.
	
&#147;Yes sir,&#148; the woman salutes.  &#147;I presume you are the KOS-MOS unit,&#148; 
she turns to Elly.
	
&#147;Huh?&#148; my lover stops gripping her head now.
	
&#147;You don&#146;t seem like it,&#148; the security guard tells her as she slowly 
returns to her feet, &#147;you look like an ordinary girl to me, but then 
again, I guess it&#146;s the same with realians these days, it&#146;s hard to 
tell them apart from humans.  Anyway, come along now.&#148;
	
&#147;No,&#148; Elly quickly backs away, &#147;I don&#146;t want to go.&#148;
	
&#147;What?&#148; Sir Wilhelm says somewhat surprised.
	
&#147;I said I don&#146;t want to go!&#148; Elly repeats in a yell.
	
&#147;Sir Wilhelm, please let me explain the situation,&#148; I try to reason 
with him.
	
&#147;I&#146;m afraid that nothing you say can change the fact that you must turn
KOS-MOS over to us now,&#148; Sir Wilhelm tells us.  &#147;Guards!&#148;
	
Two more security guards appear now, quickly taking to Elly&#146;s side and 
taking her arms into theirs.
	
&#147;Wait, you can&#146;t just...!&#148;
	
&#147;Ms. Uzuki, I&#146;m afraid...&#148;
	
&#147;Stop it!&#148; Elly orders the two guards.  &#147;Let me go!  Shion!&#148;
	
&#147;Elly!&#148;
	
I&#146;ve had enough of trying to explain my situation to the CEO, I&#146;m 
afraid the only thing I can do now is...
	
&#147;Chief, stop!&#148; Allen takes hold of my arm.
	
&#147;Let me go, Allen!&#148; I order him.  &#147;I can&#146;t just let them take Elly 
like that!&#148;
	
&#147;But Chief, no matter how you look at it...&#148;
	
&#147;Elly!&#148; I manage to break out of his hold.
	
I find my feet pushing against the floor with all my strength, quickly 
brushing past Sir Wilhelm but before I can go further, the security 
guard that was at his side suddenly brings herself before my path, her 
arms quickly taking hold of my shoulders and pushing me back.
	
&#147;Stop it!&#148; I order the woman.  &#147;I can&#146;t let you take Elly away from 
me!&#148;
	
&#147;Restrain yourself, Ms. Uzuki,&#148; the woman orders me, &#147;otherwise I will 
be forced to take drastic action.  I don&#146;t want any harm to come to 
you, so please...&#148;
	
Without thinking, I quickly bring my knee upward, striking the guard in
the rib cage.  The force of the blow makes the woman hunch forward, and
giving me the opportunity to continue my chase.  After several steps 
however, I suddenly find myself being pulled as if something were 
trapped my hair.  I succumb to the grab the security had somehow laid 
upon me, and so, I return to the source for a moment.  Instead of 
surrendering to the guard and Sir Wilhelm would expect, I bring my 
elbow back, the joint striking the lip of my captor.  My entire body 
turns around after, my left leg leading the way as the side of my foot 
meets with the torso of the woman.  Her fingers finally release their 
hold on my hair and again I hurry to my angel&#146;s rescue.
	
&#147;Elly!&#148;
	
Before I could take another step however, the woman I thought I had 
just taken care of suddenly appears before my path once more.  My fist 
is the first come forward this time, but before it could find its 
intended target, the crook of her arm blocks its path, blocking my 
attack. Before I could do anything else, a force is suddenly exerted on
my abdomen and the air flowing against my body.
	
&#147;SHION!!!!&#148; I hear my lover scream.
	
I begin to push myself up now, the pain in my stomach intensifying as I
do so.  I finally manage to at least get my head to look in the 
direction where I fell and I find the woman standing several feet away 
from me, with her arm still stretched forward.  I try to push myself 
off the ground again, but I find all of my energy suddenly drained 
thanks to that punch that woman dealt me.
	
&#147;Chief, are you all right?!&#148; Allen rushes to my aid.
	
&#147;Why you...!&#148; I look to my brother who begins to draw his sword.
	
&#147;Don&#146;t try it!&#148; the security now reaches for the pistol on her belt.
	
&#147;That will be enough, Ms. Hawwa, Ms. Uzuki,&#148; Sir Wilhelm orders.
	
&#147;No, I won&#146;t let you...!&#148;
	
&#147;Ms. Uzuki, whether you like it or not, we are taking custody of 
KOS-MOS Unit 00-00-00-00-1 as of this moment,&#148; the CEO begins to turn 
away.  &#147;Further more, because of your inability to follow orders and 
neglecting to report to HQ three days after your arrival on Second
Miltia, I&#146;m afraid to inform you that you are suspended from Vector 
Industries for six months without pay.  In addition, if you are somehow
able to violate your suspension, I will have you and your brother 
arrested for assault in your attempt to defy my orders.  Mr. Ridgeley, 
if you even attempt to help Ms. Uzuki violate her suspension, I will 
have you charged with criminal assistance.&#148;
	
&#147;Wait, I didn&#146;t do anything wrong, I would never...,&#148; Allen tries to 
object.
	
&#147;You can charge me with anything, just return Elly to me now!&#148; I order.
	
&#147;Shion please, that&#146;s enough,&#148; my brother tries to calm me down.
	
&#147;But Jin...!!!&#148;
	
&#147;Shion, forget about me for now,&#148; I look over to my lover, &#147;we...we&#146;ll 
be back together soon enough, so please...&#148;
	
&#147;Elly...&#148;
	
&#147;Ms. Hawwa, if Ms. Uzuki, her brother, or Mr. Ridgeley give you any 
more trouble on their way out, please feel free to kill them if 
necessary,&#148; Sir Wilhelm orders as he takes his leave.
	
&#147;Come on!&#148; the other two guards order my blue-haired angel as they 
follow the CEO.
	
&#147;Wait!&#148; I order, returning to my feet once again.
	
&#147;Please don&#146;t do anything else now,&#148; the guard I had just attacked 
blocks my path again.  &#147;I don&#146;t want any more harm to come to you,&#148; she
tells me politely.
	
&#147;You tell me that after you&#146;ve punched me to the ground!&#148; I seethe, 
bringing my fist forward once more.
	
Again my attack is caught, this time by the palm of her hand.  My other
hand comes forward now in a downward swing, but this time my wrist is 
caught by her right hand.  She makes no attempt to retaliate this time 
though, instead just holding me in place.  I can feel the moisture in 
my eyes beginning to escape now, more tears escaping with each blow I 
try to lay on the woman.  The attempted strikes begin to grow weaker 
now, weaker and weaker until all of my energy is converted into the 
rivers that now crawl down my face.  I find my entire body falling to
the ground now, but for some reason the woman in front of me stops my 
fall, her arms now clinging onto me tightly.  The streams that roll 
down my cheeks come to a halt for a second, freezing from the warmth of
this woman&#146;s body.  I feel my anger beginning to subside now, why, I do
not know.  This woman, though she has struck me down and taken Elly 
from me, for some reason this situation feels so... familiar.  This 
warmth that she gives me, why is it that I feel this way?
	
&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Shion,&#148; the woman begins to apologize, &#147;I truly am sorry 
about everything...&#148;
	
&#147;Everything...?&#148; I begin to look at her face now.
	
Tears now flow down the sides of her face, her mouth quivering and her 
entire body beginning to tremble.  Her hold on me begins to release 
itself now, her arms now falling to her side and her head drooping to 
the ground.  I begin to step away now, wondering what it is that&#146;s
making this woman cry.
	
&#147;I&#146;m sorry,&#148; the guard quickly begins to wipe away her tears, &#147;I didn&#146;t
mean to...  In any case, I&#146;m afraid we&#146;ll be taking custody of Elly; do
forgive me, but I&#146;m simply following my orders.  I must bid you good 
day for now,&#148; the woman looks at me for one more second before
going on her way.
	
&#145;Those eyes...,&#146; I notice now that she turns away.
	
&#147;Wait a second!&#148; I try to call after the woman.
	
The guard simply continues on her way, not wasting another second to 
look back.  For a small moment, I had just seen the guard&#146;s eyes.  They
were full of sorrow, yet so calm like the ocean.  The pupils in those 
white orbs, they were a very familiar color, a color I had only seen 
two people have.  A beautiful sky blue, that&#146;s what they were, but that
can&#146;t be, not after what happened.  It&#146;s impossible, and yet, if it is 
true, then that would explain why I felt what I did when she was 
holding me.  Could it be that...?
	
&#147;Chief, are you all right?&#148; Allen tries to ask me.
	
&#147;Blue...,&#148; I recall the color of her irises, &#147;they were... blue.&#148;
	
&#147;Chief?&#148;
	
&#147;I...I&#146;m sorry,&#148; I apologize, &#147;I must have gotten carried away back 
there.&#148;
	
&#147;Shion...,&#148; my brother looks at me with a concerned look on his face.
	
&#147;But the fact is... Elly is...,&#148; my eyes begin to melt once again, &#147;and
 I...&#148;
	
&#147;Shion, don&#146;t say anything,&#148; Jin tells me as he brings his arms around 
me, &#147;come on, let&#146;s just go home.&#148;
	
&#145;Just what am I supposed to do, Kevin?&#146; I think to myself.  &#145;After all 
your hard work to try and get her created, I couldn&#146;t...&#146;
	
&#147;...and thus I believe it is necessary to create such a force to combat
this threat,&#148; I recall that day four years ago.
	
It had been about a month since I started working at Vector, during 
that time, Kevin had created the blue prints to the original KOS-MOS, 
Miang, and was presenting the idea to the head executives of Vector.  
The meeting took place in Ariadne, it was a cold and rainy evening.  
Kevin had chosen me to act as his assistant during the meeting; why he
chose me, I still don&#146;t know to this day.
	
&#147;So you&#146;re saying that a combat android is sufficient enough to combat 
the Gnosis?&#148; one of the executives asked.  &#147;Why an android, why not 
just create a realian to do the job?&#148;
	
&#147;Sir, I believe an android is more controllable than a realian,&#148; Kevin 
continued, &#147;you see even if a military realian is programmed without 
emotions, there&#146;s always a risk that it may go out of control since 
they are capable of free will.  That is not the case with androids 
however, they have no free will whatsoever, they act accordingly to 
their original program.&#148;
	
&#147;I understand the basic concepts of your idea, Mr. Winnicott,&#148; another 
executive said, &#147;but don&#146;t you think our current military forces are 
enough to defend us from these attacks?&#148;
	
&#147;Actually I&#146;d like my assistant, Ms. Uzuki, to answer that question.&#148;
	
&#147;What, but Chief Winnicott...!&#148; I said shocked at his last statement.
	
&#147;Well Ms. Uzuki, what do you think?&#148;
	
&#147;Well, I, uh...  To tell you the truth, I don&#146;t think our current 
military forces are enough to combat the Gnosis,&#148; I blurted out.  &#147;Even
if we had all of our forces together, it wouldn&#39;t do any real damage to
the Gnosis. We would only be able to protect ourselves for a period of 
time before they break through our defenses, which is why the KOS-MOS 
Project is so important.&#148;
	
&#147;Reading over your file, it says that each unit of the KOS-MOS Project 
is equipped with the Hilbert Effect,&#148; one of the committee members 
followed, bringing the report to his eyes, &#147;I don&#39;t see how that can 
really change anything if we can simply add that to every spacecraft, 
it seems a lot less expensive than creating a whole legion of these 
androids.&#148;
	
&#147;Yes, well...,&#148; I found myself stuttering.  &#147;The androids would be more
mobile then the space ships, sir.  They&#39;re also smaller in size and 
would be of more use in other areas, where a ship is far too big to.....&#148;
	
&#147;Ms. Uzuki, you are well aware of the fact that our company also 
creates the smallest space ships in the universe, do you not?&#148; a third 
member asked.  &#147;I&#39;m sure a simple pod-like ship would be enough to stop
a Gnosis if the ship were equipped with the Hilbert Effect.&#148;
	
&#147;Uh... Oh..., but you see, I think the benefits of the KOS-MOS Project 
would be well worth it, sir,&#148; I tried to explain.
	
&#147;How long have you been with the company so far, Ms. Uzuki?&#148; the same 
committee member asked.  &#147;Not even a year?  Tell me this, why should we
go along with a plan that an employee, who doesn&#39;t seem to know much 
about the company and hasn&#39;t even been a year with us at that, issued 
us?  Why should the committee approve such a project that one with very
little experience and knowledge offered us?&#148;
	
&#147;Because sir... I...,&#148; my words began to fumble, &#147;the project itself 
may seem far-fetched but it would be a great advantage for us once...!&#148;
	
&#147;That is all Ms. Uzuki, Mr. Winnicott,&#148; another member interrupted.  
&#147;We shall give you the committee&#146;s decision within a week&#146;s time, good 
day.&#148;
	
&#147;Ye..yes sir,&#148; were the last words I could recall.
	
After all that trouble, after all that humiliation I went through on 
that day, the company decides to just take Elly away from me as if she 
meant nothing to me.  The company didn&#146;t even seem to want to go 
through the project though, and yet here they are demanding that I turn
Elly over to them.  I can&#146;t believe the company has stepped over me 
like this.  I would issue a complaint, but even I know things will work
against me if I did, I assaulted that security guard after all.  Elly, 
why did they have to take her now, why take away the one I love?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(MOMO&#146;s POV)

	
We&#146;re surrounded, this can&#146;t be happening, after everyone&#146;s hard work 
to try and keep these people away from me, they&#146;re still able to...  
	
I can&#146;t control the trembling in my knees, the air in my lungs begins 
to grow short, and I&#146;m starting to feel faint.  The soldiers jump out 
of their machines now, each of them pointing a projectile weapon at us.
I find my feet automatically forcing me to back away, stopping the 
moment my back meets with the side of the car.  I look to my sides to 
find my friends standing beside me.  Jr.&#146;s fingers twitch nearly every 
second, he seems so tense as he tries to hold back from pulling his 
guns&#146; triggers.  chaos stands perfectly still, his arms barely relaxed 
as they dangle next to his sides, but his face shows an expression I&#146;ve
hardly seen him wear, an expression of anger.  Ziggy on the other hand,
stands with his hands already behind his head with his face totally 
calm.
	
&#147;That&#146;s right, no one need to die needlessly,&#148; the commanding female 
voice from the largest A.G.W.S. says as we all put our hands in the 
air.
	
&#147;Jr., Ziggy, what do we do now?&#148; I ask, keeping my voice as low as 
possible.
	
&#147;Stay calm, MOMO,&#148; Ziggy orders me.  &#147;As long as we cooperate, no harm 
will come to you.  Their goal is to retrieve you unharmed, there is a 
very low probability that will do anything rash.&#148;
	
&#147;What about you, Jr., and chaos?&#148;
	
&#147;Don&#146;t worry about us,&#148; Jr. tells me, &#147;we&#146;ll think of a way how to get 
out of this.  It&#146;s not like this is going to be the end, you know.&#148;
	
&#147;You, the pink-haired girl, get over here, now!&#148; one of the U-TIC 
soldiers orders me in a harsh tone.  &#147;Don&#146;t try anything stupid or 
we&#146;ll fill each of your friends with holes.  The same thing applies to 
you three,&#148; the soldier turns his attention to the others, &#147;try 
anything and we&#146;ll open fire!&#148;
	
&#147;Before that, do you guarantee the safety of the others?&#148; I ask their 
leader.
	
&#147;What?&#148;
	
&#147;Will you spare my friends if I agree to go with you?&#148;
	
&#147;The others will be spared if you go with us,&#148; the woman in the largest
A.G.W.S. answers, &#147;you have my word.&#148;
	
&#147;Okay...&#148;
	
&#147;MOMO, don&#146;t!&#148; Jr. yells.
	
The deal I made with the woman makes Jr. bare his teeth.  I can see how
desperately he wants to draw his weapons again and open fire on the 
U-TIC soldiers, and I can understand how he feels, but I don&#146;t want to 
see any of my friends injured on my account.  I bring my hand onto 
Jr.&#146;s shoulder now, causing the muscles in his face loosen.  I give him
a soft smile and the rest of his body grows even less tense.  I take a 
moment to smile at him for a little while so that he can relieve more 
of his anger, gazing into his eyes until I feel as if there is no more.
I turn back to the soldiers now, my smile quickly melting away when I 
realize the fate that awaits me.  Without looking back, I begin to walk
forward now, walking until I find myself at the feet of the giant, 
dark-colored machine.
	
&#147;A wise choice, 100-Series Observational Realian,&#148; the pilot inside 
says.  &#147;Now kill the rest of them as ordered!&#148;
	
&#147;What?!  You said that...!&#148;
	
A blast of gunfire echoes in my ears now, my eyes shutting the moment 
the roar of the bullets enters my ears.  I quickly shut my eyes after, 
my knees pushing to the ground and my arms hugging the sides of my 
head.  I find myself being suddenly lifted from where I sat, my stomach
resting against what seems to be someone&#146;s shoulder and my legs 
dangling.
	
&#147;Put me down!&#148; I order, my eyes and throat burning.  &#147;How could you 
just open fire on them after you promised!  You&#146;re the worst person 
ever!  I won&#146;t forgive you for this!&#148;
	
&#147;Is that what you say to the person that saved you?&#148;
	
&#147;Huh?&#148;
	
I open my eyes and find a black jacket clinging onto the body of the 
one that saved me.  I look a little to the right to find a shade of 
red hair and blue eyes.
	
&#147;Jr.?&#148;
	
&#147;You idiots!  Fire!  Fire!&#148; the woman in the giant mech orders her men 
as a hail of bullets fires from the sky.
	
I look upward now to find another machine, this one the same height as 
the dark-colored one the woman pilots.  The A.G.W.S. is a light blue 
color, it&#146;s legs have a similar design to Jr.&#146;s A.G.W.S., but it has 
two large guns coming out of its back.  The bullets fired from the 
U-TIC soldiers have no effect on the giant robot regardless of where 
the projectiles hit.  Another hail of bullets rains from the A.G.W.S., 
this one killing a majority of the soldiers on the ground.
	
&#147;Dammit, this was unexpected,&#148; the pilot in the dark-colored mech 
curses.  &#147;Looks like I have no choice but to retreat for now, but I 
swear, I&#146;ll make you all pay for this.&#148;
	
&#147;Pellegri, wait!&#148; I look over to find chaos trying to chase after her.
	
&#147;You?!&#148; the mech comes to a halt in mid-air.
	
The blue machine tries to attack now, another burst of fire escaping 
the barrels of its weapons.  The dark one somehow manages to dodge each
shot, evading the fire by weaving from side-to-side.  Seeing that his 
current tactics aren&#146;t working, the pilot of the blue A.G.W.S. now
rushes forward with its right fist launching forward.  Its opponent 
intercepts the attack with the lunge of its spear, forcing the blue 
A.G.W.S. to stop its punch and make it open its hands in order to catch
the attack.  Unfortunately the spear attack was only a decoy, the real 
attack was a kick that came from the dark-colored A.G.W.S.
	
&#147;I have no time for this,&#148; Pellegri tells the pilot in the blue 
A.G.W.S., &#147;but I had no idea you were here,&#148; she turns her attention 
back to chaos.  &#147;Is this what you&#146;ve decided?&#148; she asks only to get a 
response of silence.  &#147;Hm, I see..., if that&#146;s the case, it won&#146;t be 
long until we see each other again.&#148;
	
Without saying another word, the dark-colored A.G.W.S. begins to fly 
into the atmosphere.  I turn my attention back to Jr. who stands beside
me and find him unharmed from the sudden attack. His anger has already 
subsided, but he doesn&#146;t give me his usual smile.  Still, he gives me a
look of relief which assures me that he&#146;s okay.  I turn to my side to 
find Ziggy now approaching us, his expression as calm as ever.
	
&#147;MOMO, are you okay?&#148; Jr. asks me.
	
&#147;I&#146;m okay,&#148; I answer, &#147;but who was it that saved us?&#148;
	
&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; Ziggy answers as the blue machine begins to land near 
us, &#147;but perhaps we&#146;ll find out.&#148;
	
The cockpit of the machine opens now, a small cloud of smoke breathing 
out as a man in a Federation Military uniform makes his way out of the 
A.G.W.S.  As the smoke clears, the first color I see emerge from the 
smoke is a bright orange color.  His hair, that&#146;s the first thing we 
see, his somewhat shaggy hair that covers his entire forehead and a 
majority of the back of his neck.  His uniform though, is a bit 
different than normal military uniforms in terms of color.  Instead of
being a dark blue color like most A.G.W.S. pilots&#146; clothing, his suit 
is a greenish-gray shade.  The zipper on the top half of his uniform is
partially open, revealing a blank white t-shirt underneath.  I turn my 
attention to his face now; his chin is very sharp, yet his nose is a 
bit flat.  The biggest surprise, however, is the color of his eyes, 
they&#146;re a bright yellow color, the same color as mine.
	
&#147;Who are you,&#148; I ask the man, &#147;are you a realian too?&#148;
	
&#147;Correct,&#148; the pilot answers with a monotone expression, &#147;I am a 
Federation Military Realian, designated name &#145;Canaan.&#146;&#148;
	
The way he speaks, it&#146;s eerily similar to how KOS-MOS used to talk.  
Monotone, not a shred of emotion is found in his voice, I thought even 
military realians were programmed to show some emotions.
	
&#147;Canaan, it&#146;s been a while,&#148; chaos greets the realian standing before 
us.
	
&#147;It appears so, chaos,&#148; Canaan nods.  &#147;My apologies,&#148; he turns to Jr. 
after, &#147;I did not see you there, Rubedo.&#148;
	
&#147;Forget about it,&#148; Jr. tells the military realian.
	
&#147;You all know each other?&#148; Ziggy asks the three.
	
&#147;It&#146;s a long story,&#148; chaos answers, &#147;but in any case, it&#146;s a good thing
you were flying around, Canaan, if you weren&#146;t I don&#146;t even want to 
imagine what might have happened.&#148;
	
&#147;Actually I was on my way to the Uzuki Residence,&#148; Canaan explains, 
&#147;my orders were to assist in bringing the 100-Series Observational 
Realian to the UMN Central HQ.  It was by chance that I was able to 
find the three of you under attack by the U-TIC Organization.&#148;
	
&#147;Still, thank you very much for rescuing us,&#148; I thank the military 
realian.
	
&#147;I was merely performing my duty,&#148; Canaan answers.  &#147;With the current 
threat now over, I suggest that you bring the 100-Series Observational 
Realian over to the UMN Central HQ.  To prevent any further attacks by 
U-TIC, I will escort you three there.&#148;
	
&#147;Yeah, that&#146;d be a great idea,&#148; Jr. agrees.
	
To the UMN Central HQ, I should be safe there, even if I won&#146;t be, at 
least I&#146;ll be able to see Mommy again.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(Ziggy&#146;s POV)

	
The UMN Central HQ, my final destination for this mission, the first 
part in becoming a complete machine.
	
&#147;Follow me,&#148; the military realian orders the four of us.
	
We begin to walk down the empty entrance hall of the building, not a 
single person or furniture in sight.  Looking down this hall reminds me
of what will become of me; all my memories erased, not a shred of 
emotion, a blank slate is what I will be left with after this mission 
is complete.
	
&#147;You have finally arrived,&#148; the voice of a middle-aged woman enters my 
ears now.
	
&#147;Mommy, I...,&#148; MOMO tries to speak with her, speak with the woman who 
is supposed to be her mother.
	
&#147;You have done well, Ziggurat 8,&#148; Juli turns her attention toward me, 
not saying a single word to her daughter.  &#147;Your mission is now 
complete, I thank you for your efforts.&#148;
	
&#147;You&#146;re welcome,&#148; are the only words I can say.
	
&#147;It&#146;s been so long, Mommy, I...&#148;
	
&#147;Ziggurat 8, come with me,&#148; the woman now tells me, again not saying 
anything to her daughter.  &#147;Canaan, take the rest of them to the third 
level laboratory in section 5.&#148;
	
&#147;Yes ma&#146;am.&#148;
	
&#147;Mommy, can we...,&#148; MOMO tries to speak with mother again, but still 
gets no response.
	
&#147;Come along now,&#148; the orange-haired realian orders my comrades.
	
&#147;Can you give us one moment?&#148; chaos asks the man.  &#147;Ziggy, I appreciate
the help you&#146;ve given us on our journey so far.  I just thought I 
should thank you, that&#146;s all.&#148;
	
&#147;Yes, thank you, Ziggy,&#148; MOMO tells me as well.
	
I turn to the captain of the Durandal now.  His eyes may be facing the 
floor, but I can tell that his pupils are still filled with anger and 
rage toward me.  His naivety is getting the best of him, I know he has 
no words for me, it is probably best this way.
	
My employer begins to take her leave now and I begin to follow.  
There&#146;s no need to look back at my former comrades, however...
	
&#147;We&#146;ll meet again, won&#146;t we, Ziggy?&#148; I find the little girl&#146;s hands 
wrapped around my own.
	
I turn to her for a second, turning to the yellow irises in her eyes.  
Water begins to drop from the edges of her pupils and her lips begin to
quiver.  Her hold on my hand begins to tighten now and her brow falls 
to my arm, pulling the rest of her body closer to mine.  I do nothing 
but stand there as she holds me, do nothing but observe the young 
child.  She begins to remind me of that day now, reminding me of the 
warmth of his hand and the tears that were shed that day.  I feel my 
throat beginning to grow parched now, a feeling I had not felt in the 
longest time.  My eyes are beginning to burn as well; I know that if I 
were to continue standing here these unwanted feelings will only 
worsen.
	
I then place my free hand on the child&#146;s head and say, &#147;We will meet 
again, MOMO.&#148;
	
I begin to walk now, slowly freeing my arm from MOMO&#146;s hold as I follow
my employer to one of the elevators at the end of the hall.  Not a word
is said as the two of us ride the lift to the lower floors of the 
building, my thoughts still lingering to the young girl&#146;s hold on my 
hand.  When I look into my palm, I see her teary-eyed face once more 
and the last words she said to me.  This is very unprofessional of me, 
I shouldn&#146;t be thinking of such things.
	
&#147;You&#146;ve grown close to her I see,&#148; my employer suddenly speaks.
	
&#147;Excuse me?&#148;
	
&#147;It&#146;s nothing...&#148;
	
&#147;This isn&#146;t any of my business, but I have to say that you were rude to
her back there,&#148; I suddenly bring up.  &#147;You didn&#146;t say a single word to
your own daughter.&#148;
	
&#147;That shouldn&#146;t be any of your concern,&#148; Juli retorts.  &#147;If I didn&#146;t 
know better, I&#146;d say you&#146;ve grown very attached to that realian.&#148;
	
At the risk of insulting her any further, I decide to say nothing else.
Grown an attachment to MOMO, I believe there is some truth to what 
Juli had said.  It is very unprofessional of me, however, when I become
a complete machine, it will be a piece of my new blank slate...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(Jr.&#146;s POV)

	
I watch from the other side of the glass as they place MOMO in the 
center of the room.  As all of the workers do their individual tasks, 
she wears her usual smile, the smile she&#146;s always been wearing ever 
since Albedo...
	
&#147;Are you all right, Jr.?&#148; chaos&#146;s voice interrupts my thoughts.
	
&#147;Huh?&#148;
	
&#147;You seem troubled about something, is everything all right?&#148;
	
&#147;Yeah, I&#146;m fine,&#148; I assure him, doing my best to brush away my anger.
	
My attention returns to the other room now, to the other side of the 
glass where MOMO still stands.  That smile, no matter what situation 
she&#146;s in, no matter what happens, she always wears that smile.  Why is 
it that every time I see that smile I&#146;m almost driven to tears?  When I
saw that smile back then, I never cried, and now...
	
&#147;Is she always like this?&#148;
	
&#147;I&#146;m afraid so, Rubedo.  My daughter, Sakura, I&#146;m afraid she&#146;s been 
brain-dead for as long as I can remember.&#148;
	
Sakura Mizrahi, I first met her fifteen years ago, and I met her in her
comatose state.  She couldn&#146;t speak, she couldn&#146;t see, and she couldn&#146;t
hear, but that didn&#146;t stop me from wanting to talk to her.
	
&#147;So there is no way to communicate with her?&#148; Gaignun had asked.
	
&#147;There is a way, Nigredo, although the technology itself is not 
perfected yet,&#148; Mizrahi answered.  &#147;Have you ever heard of an 
encephalon?  It&#146;s a recently-made technology that creates an artificial
environment in one&#146;s brain.  I have created an encephalon specifically 
for my daughter so that my wife, Juli, and I could speak with her in 
her current state.  If you like, I could introduce you three to her.&#148;
	
&#147;We really don&#146;t have time for stuff like that,&#148; I answered, &#147;we&#146;ll 
continue waiting for Yuriev as ordered.&#148;
	
I don&#146;t know why, but regardless of what I said, I really did want to 
talk with her.  Was it because I was intrigued by her, or was it 
because of Yuriev&#146;s wish to have us, his &#147;children,&#148; try to expand our 
horizons and meet new people.
	
&#147;Oh come on, Rubedo, can we take a break for once?&#148; Albedo begged.
	
Albedo, he was so different back then.  He wasn&#146;t that maniac who took 
pleasure in mutilating himself or harming others, he was so innocent, 
so childish, so...weak.
	
&#147;It&#146;s not going to do us any harm, Rubedo,&#148; Gaignun added.  &#147;It&#146;s not 
like we&#146;re really going anywhere, it will give us something to do while
we wait.&#148;
	
I&#146;m not sure what was with me back then.  I always stuck to my duties 
back, almost as if I had no mind of my own.  Funny how I get angry at 
others who are like that in the present, I just find it most ironic 
that I dislike people who are like the person I was in the past.  
However that day was different, I decided to take a break from our 
orders, I made my very own decision for once.
	
&#147;...all right, but we&#146;ll only stay for a short period,&#148; I decided to 
give in.
	
It wasn&#146;t long before the four of us were given dive units.  In the 
blink of an eye, the laboratory had disappeared.  A lush garden filled 
with orchids and other flowers was now beneath our feet.  Blue sky, 
white clouds, and a soft breeze, it was like something you&#146;d only read 
in fairy tales.  It wasn&#146;t long before the sound of a piano began 
playing.  We all turned to the source the moment the soft melody began 
playing, finding a young girl with dark brown hair sitting in the 
middle of the garden while playing the piano.  I don&#146;t know how to 
describe what I felt when I saw her, all I know is that it was the 
first time I had ever felt that way.  Duty, mission, orders, these 
words and others associated with them had vanished the moment I saw 
her; I felt like we were the only ones standing in the garden that day.
	
The piano had come to a halt shortly after, the player&#146;s attention now 
turning toward us.  The moment her eyes met with mine, I felt as if my 
heart skipped a beat.  For once I felt lost, lost within those 
beautiful cinnamon eyes.  A smile fell upon her face moments after, 
that smile forever etching into my memory.
	
&#147;Sakura, I&#146;d like you to meet some of daddy&#146;s friends,&#148; Mizrahi said as
he introduced us.
	
&#147;I&#146;m Nigredo.&#148;
	
&#147;A...  A...  My name&#146;s Albedo..., h...  how do you do?&#148;
	
&#147;Rubedo, they call me Rubedo.&#148;
	
&#147;Hello, it&#146;s nice to meet you all!&#148; she said, her smile growing 
brighter with her voice.
	
&#147;Is everything ready?&#148; Juli Mizrahi&#146;s voice returns me to the present.
	
&#147;Yes ma&#146;am,&#148; one worker answers.
	
&#147;Then begin the download of the Y-Data.&#148;
	
&#147;Roger.  Initiating the link up between the 100-Series Observational 
Realian Prototype and the UMN.&#148;
	
The next room begins to glow a light blue as MOMO continues to stand at
the center of the area.  Her body begins to float as more of that light
begins to emit from her body.  Her gaze turns to me for a mere second, 
her smile still being worn on her face.  I return the expression with
one of my own and she nods.  Her lips lose their curl gradually as her 
eyes begin to close.  Eventually her body lies in midair, completely 
unsuspended as the illumination grows brighter.  Then another color 
begins to fill the room, the color red.  The sound of alarms begin to 
ring now, the blue light beginning to dim.
	
&#147;What&#146;s going on?!&#148; Juli jumps from her seat at the sound of the alarm.
	
&#147;A virus is being uploaded into the UMN System,&#148; one of the workers 
reports.
	
&#147;What, that&#146;s impossible!  Where&#146;s it coming from?!&#148;
	
&#147;The 100-Series, ma&#146;am!&#148;
	
&#147;What the hell?!&#148; I bang my fist against the glass wall.  &#147;MOMO!&#148;
	
The expression on her face is one I wished I would never see her in 
again.  The expression of pain, I never wanted to ever see it again.  
The way her face scrunches, how her body twists, again I&#146;m reminded of 
that time.
	
&#147;No, stop it!&#148; I cry.
	
The sound of her cries, how she called out my name during that time.  
When she ran between the both of us during that fateful day fourteen 
years ago, and that time when that monster, when that bastard violated 
her.  No, don&#146;t remind me, don&#146;t show me again!  Stop it, just stop it!
	
&#147;Rubedo, you murderer!&#148;
	
&#147;No, it&#146;s your fault why she died!&#148;
	
&#147;So sweet, so alive!&#148;
	
&#147;Get your hand off her you mother...!&#148;
	
&#147;Help me, Jr.!&#148; her cry echoes in my mind once more.
	
&#147;NNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&#148;
	
The entire room grows dark suddenly, but the light returns a second 
after.  The plug had been pulled for a moment, but that brief second 
wasn&#146;t enough to free me from these memories.  The cold feel of the 
floor still crawls up my temple, the blood in my veins boiling in my 
fists, and my eyes still burning like coal.
	
&#147;Jr., are you all right?&#148; chaos tries to ask me.
	
He helps me return to my feet, allowing me to get another view of the 
next room.  A whole crowd of workers now surround her.  I can barely 
see her, see her as she lies on the ground now entirely motionless.  
Her &#147;mother&#148; brings her fingers to her wrist now and I prepare for the
worst.
	
&#147;She&#146;s still alive,&#148; Juli announces, &#147;take her over to the maintenance 
lab in the second floor.&#148;
	
I breath a sigh of relief upon hearing the news.  She&#146;s still alive, 
that&#146;s good to hear, but why do I have a feeling that everything&#146;s not 
okay.
	
&#147;Ma&#146;am, we have another problem,&#148; another worker informs her.
	
&#147;What is it?&#148;
	
&#147;I&#146;m afraid a gate has suddenly opened.&#148;
	
&#147;A gate?  Which one?&#148;
	
&#147;You&#146;re not going to believe this, but it&#146;s the gate to Old Miltia.&#148;
	
The gate to Old Miltia, only he could have done this.  Albedo you 
bastard, just what the hell are you up to this time?!

(Jin&#146;s POV)

	
&#147;Chief, no matter how you look at it, they would have taken KOS-MOS 
back at some point,&#148; Allen says as he tries to comfort my sister, &#147;I 
mean, even you had to know this day would eventually come.&#148;
	
&#147;It doesn&#39;t matter, Allen!&#148; Shion screams, her fist meeting with the 
edge of the counter.  &#147;I didn&#39;t try to stop her in the end and I&#39;m sure
there was more I could do.  I promised Elly I would always be with her.
It&#39;s not fair of me to just hand her over like that.  I should have 
tried harder!&#148;
	
She&#146;s been like this for the last two hours.  My sister is not one who 
gets this upset, even what the two of us argue.  Alcohol is a substance
she usually ignores, even when going out with her friends.  To tell you
the truth, I can only think of one instance aside from this one in 
which she&#146;s consumed it.  Naturally I can&#146;t help but worry, even though
I know she&#146;ll get over it in time.  At least, I hope she&#146;ll get over 
it.
	
&#147;Shion, it&#39;s not like you could have done anything,&#148; I tell her, &#147;and 
even if you did try anything right now, Sir Wilhelm said he would have 
you arrested.  I mean, you&#39;re lucky enough to only get laid off after 
assaulting that security guard.&#148;
	
&#147;Still Jin, I let her down when I could have done more to keep her 
safe,&#148; she says as she takes another shot of her drink.  &#147;You just 
don&#39;t go around and let people take away who you care about.  I don&#39;t 
care what happens to me, so long as Elly is safe.&#148;
	
&#147;Shion, there are some things you can&#39;t control, things we can&#39;t...&#148;
	
&#147;You aren&#39;t listening to me!&#148; she interrupts.  &#147;I could have done more,
tried harder for her!  But I didn&#39;t.  I let those people take her away 
without so much as an argument.  How would you feel if you did that, 
Jin?&quot;
	
&#147;Um Chief, I don&#39;t want to take sides, but you practically beat that 
security guard crazy,&#148; Allen suddenly brings up.
	
&#147;Allen!  That&#39;s a horrible thing to say!&#148; she yells at her co-worker.  
&#147;And Jin, imagine how you would feel if you just let some stranger tote
me off like baggage without trying to stop them!  How would you feel?&quot;
	
How would I feel?  The thought never really occurred to me.  Even when 
I learned of her engagement two years ago, the thought of her being 
taken away from me never crossed my mind.  Anger, sadness, regret, 
would I feel each of these things or all of them?  Why, why is that I 
don&#146;t have an answer?
	
&#147;In all honesty, Shion, I...  I don&#39;t know,&#148; I answer.  &#147;I don&#39;t know 
what I&#39;d do.&#148;
	
&#147;Then don&#39;t tell me how I should or shouldn&#39;t feel when you don&#39;t 
know!&#148; my sister reacted, chugging down another glass.
	
&#147;God, you&#39;re acting the same way you did when Kevin died!&#148;
	
Wait, what did I just say?  No, I didn&#146;t mean to say that, I never 
wanted to say that.  His death was always a touchy subject with Shion, 
and bringing it up like this is too cruel.
	
The side of my face begins to sting suddenly as it suddenly jolts to 
the side.  I turn my gaze back at my sister now as her hand rests on 
the air where my face was.  Her eyes are narrower than they ever were 
before, her entire face red with anger, and her other hand balled. 
What I said was definitely inappropriate and I know I deserved that 
slap.  Still, I...
	
&#147;How can you say such a thing to me, Jin?!&#148; she screams, tears 
streaming down her face as rapid as ever.  &#147;Elly means a lot to me and 
I&#39;m worried about her! You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about you 
jerk!&#148;
	
&#147;Shion...  I...&#148;
	
Before I could say another word, she quickly turns away and runs out of
the bar.  I sit there on my stool now with my hand still reaching out 
to her, my face still burning from her strike.  The pain on my cheek 
has cooled, but the emotion behind it still pierces my heart.
	
&#147;Jin, that was a cold thing to say, especially coming from her 
brother!&#148; Allen tells me, disgusted.
	
I say nothing more and sink deeper into my chair.  Even Allen begins to
leave the bar now, leaving me to sit alone with my thoughts.  The day 
Kevin died, it was a very difficult day my sister had to live through.
She must be living through that day again with Miss KOS-MOS now out of 
her life.  But what she said about how I would feel if someone had 
taken her away.  Why do I continue to keep thinking about that?  Is 
that day coming sooner than I had expected?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

(Elly&#146;s POV)

	
Clack, clack, clack!  The constant beating of my shoes hitting the 
floor echoes continuously down the hallways.  The sound of more shoes 
follows in close to pursuit, the sound growing closer and closer with 
every step I take.  All of my muscles in my legs continue to burn as I 
run, the breath I take into my lungs practically scraping against my 
throat, and the throbbing of my heart crashes against my chest.
	
&#147;Don&#146;t worry, it&#146;s just the &#145;Drive,&#146;&#148; one voice continues trying to 
falsely assure me.
	
Again I try to ignore the voices, but no matter how fast I run and 
where I turn, they continue to follow.  I turn at the next corner I 
see, hoping to evade the source of the voices once more.  It fails to 
do so as they continue to chase faster than ever, their voices growing 
even louder.
	
&#147;The &#145;Drive&#146; will just readjust your balance and make you feel good.&#148;
	
The voices continue to pressure me, and again I try to deafen them with
my own.
	
&#147;I don&#146;t want it!&#148; I tell them for the millionth time.  &#147;I, I don&#146;t 
want to use it!&#148;
	
My words still have no avail.  They continue to draw come closer and 
closer, I can feel their breaths beginning to beat against my back.  My
feet push even further into the ground now, only to come to a stop a 
moment later.  A dead end, there&#146;s no more room to run.  I bang my fist
against the wall for a moment, my eyes practically melting knowing that
I can do no more.  The other feet begin to slow down now, their owners 
now within a few arms reach.
	
&#147;You think we&#146;re going to make an exception because your father&#146;s top 
brass?&#148;
	
&#147;Please!  Go away!&#148; I beg.
	
They ignore my pleads, instead grabbing me by the arms.  One pulls me 
toward him in a very swift motion, nearly pulling the bone out of its 
socket.  Another pushes me against the wall, pinning my other arm 
against it so that I can&#146;t move.  My three captors continue to chuckle 
as I try my best to escape their grasp but it is to no avail.  There is
nothing I can do but try to shield my eyes away from these men, shield 
them from what they&#146;re going to do.
	
&#147;Please!  Stop it!&#148; I cry once more.  &#147;STOP IT!!!!!!!!!!&#148;
	
In a flash, I feel the force planted on my arms vanishing.  The voices 
have come to a stop as well, but the question is why.  The darkness 
begins to pull away from my vision slowly, revealing to me a gruesome 
sight.  The silver-metal halls are now painted with random splashes of
crimson, the stench of rotting meat now filling the air.  I cover my 
mouth to prevent the contents of my stomach from escaping, and for a 
second, it allows it to settle.  I turn to the floor to find a more 
hideous sight; the three men that were chasing me now lie dead.  Their 
mouths are as open as they can be, the holes where their eyes once were
now oozing with scarlet.  Ruby lakes now rest beneath each of the 
bodies, all of them flowing from craters where some of their arms or
legs used to be.  Their faces are horribly disfigured, but the 
expression of anguish and great pain is still visible on all of them.  
My knees weaken at the sight, forcing me to fall to the floor.  A warm
liquid rushes onto my palms now, the red substance tainting the skin 
underneath my gloves.  It&#146;s blood, their blood.  My lips begin to 
quiver now as I stare at the elixir of life in my palms, quivering as 
my eyes begin to burn.  My breath begins to hiccup and my nose begins 
to run, I don&#146;t care what the reason is, but I didn&#146;t need to kill 
those men, I didn&#146;t need to kill my fellow classmates!
	
I wake up screaming after seeing that horrific image.  My heart beats 
repeatedly against my chest for a few seconds, each beat growing slower
than the last.  My entire body feels as if its on fire, yet it cools in
a few moments time.  I realize that what I had just seen was another 
dream, but like the one this morning, it felt so real.  I try to assure
myself that it was just a nightmare, but the feeling of those men 
chasing after me and their blood on my hands continues to return. 
Eventually I brush away the last remnants of that dream only to find 
myself in a room and bed I had never seen before.
	
&#145;Where am I?&#146; I think to myself.
	
That&#146;s when I remember; this is a cell in the Vector Second R &amp; D 
Division, I can&#146;t remember its exact location though.  Before they put 
me in here, I remember they took me to a laboratory, trying to connect 
me to different machines.  They injected me with something and then
everything went black.  I&#146;m not sure what they did, but it doesn&#146;t look
like they injured me in any way seeing how there&#146;s not even a scratch 
on my body.  
	
Before I can recollect any more events, my temple begins to throb once 
more.  I bring my palm to my forehead in an attempt to ease the pain, 
but it does nothing.  A creaking noise follows the headache, the noise 
coming from somewhere in the room.  I turn to the door on the west side
of the room to see the nob turning.  The beating of my heart begins to 
throb fast again as my legs begin to shiver.  I swallow down the lump 
in my throat causing the pain to disappear and calming my knees once 
more.  I ball up my hands into fists now, preparing for the imminent 
threat that waits on the other side.  I may not be as strong as I used 
to, but I can still use Ether.
	
&#147;Who&#39;s there?&#148; I call to the person on the other side of the door.
	
The door begins to swing open now and a person begins to make their way
inside.  The one who enters carries a tray in her hands; it has what 
looks like a sandwich and a glass of water.  The person slowly closes 
the door after setting foot in the cell, closing it very slowly and 
quietly.  It is now that I begin to recognize her.  It&#146;s the security 
guard Shion had fought with earlier when they took me away.  The wrap 
my thumb has on my knuckles tightens now upon realizing this, but my 
anger toward this person begins to fade as she comes closer with the 
tray.  My body begins to loosen now, all the tension eventually 
disappearing.  She stands before me now with the tray still in her 
hands and she begins to speak.
	
&#147;I&#39;ve brought you something to eat,&#148; she places the tray on the bed.  
&#147;I imagine you&#39;ve got to be hungry by now.&#148;
	
My eyes turn to the food the woman put down.  I take a moment to glance
at the two slices of bread and the jam smashed between them, but I do 
not give into the yearnings of my stomach.  This woman may be up to 
something, if she could attack Shion just like that with no hesitation,
then...
	
&#147;The food is fine, we haven&#39;t done anything to it,&#148; she tries to assure
me.  &#147;If you don&#39;t believe me, I can prove it to you.&#148;
	
She breaks off a small piece of the sandwich and brings it to her 
mouth.  The guard chews it for only a second before swallowing its 
contents.  I wait a few seconds to see if there are any repercussions.
There are none, but despite that, I still feel as if this woman is up 
to something.
	
&#147;Why are you doing this for me?&#148; I decide to ask.
	
&#147;Is this how you react to everyone you meet?&#148; the woman dodges my 
question with one of her own.  &#147;Or is it just to me?  I assumed you&#39;d 
have been hungry, sitting in this cell.  That&#39;s why I brought you food,
now please, eat.&#148;
	
I take up on the woman&#146;s offer and take the sandwich into my mouth.  
The mashed fruit is rather bitter and the bread dry.  Regardless, it 
does calm the grumbling of my stomach.  I take the glass of water after
and proceed to drink it, but I notice that the guard is watching me 
closely.  Having her observe me like this makes me feel uneasy, so I 
speak to her once more.
	
&#147;Is there something wrong?&#148;
	
&#147;It&#146;s nothing,&#148; she answers.  &#147;It&#146;s just that you really are acting 
more and more like her everyday it seems.&#148;
	
&#147;More like her, what are you talking about?&#148;
	
&#147;Ms. Hawwa, it looks like most of the guards are gone now,&#148; another 
individual suddenly appears at the door of my cell.
	
&#147;Miyuki?&#148; I recognize the young woman almost immediately.
	
&#147;Alright, we&#146;ll proceed as planned,&#148; the security guard nods.  &#147;Elly, 
come with me. We&#39;re going to go to the A.G.W.S hangar.&#148;
	
&#147;The A.G.W.S. hangar?&#148; her order leave me confused.  &#147;Wait a minute, 
what are you going to do with me this time?&#148; I ask only to have her run
ahead.  &#147;Hey don&#39;t ignore me, I&#39;m talking to you!&#148;
	
I follow the woman outside of the cell where she and Miyuki wait.  The 
guard rushes to the east as soon as she sees me, stopping at the corner
at the end of the hall.  She leans down its side for a mere moment, 
quickly bringing her head back after.  Miyuki then quietly proceeds to
the woman&#146;s location and I follow close behind, checking behind my 
shoulder ever once and a while in case anyone else comes.
	
&#147;Miyuki, what are you doing here?&#148; I ask in barely a whisper.
	
&#147;I saw you and Shion come in here earlier,&#148; she answers.  &#147;I tried to 
say hi but the elevator doors closed before you could even see me.  
Then later I saw Shion running out of the building crying, so I thought
something must be wrong.  When I learned you were here, I...&#148;
	
&#147;I see,&#148; I interrupt her, &#147;then what about this woman?  Why&#146;s she 
helping us out?&#148;
	
&#147;You mean you don&#146;t know Ms. Hawwa?&#148; Miyuki says, surprised.  &#147;The 
funny thing is, this was her idea.&#148;
	
&#147;Her idea?&#148;
	
&#147;Sh!  Be quiet!&#148; Ms. Hawwa orders us.
	
I step in front of her so that I may take a look at the other side of 
the corner.  Three security guards stand there, all of them with their 
backs currently turned toward our location.  One of them begins to turn
now and I quickly return to the other side, flattening myself against
the wall.
	
&#147;There&#39;s at least three of them,&#148; Ms. Hawwa says.  &#147;Elly, Miyuki, I 
want you to wait here.&#148;
	
Ms. Hawwa reaches for the two tonfa on her belt now, spinning them 
along her wrists after drawing them.  She begins to creep away from our
side of the wall, allowing me to take her spot.  Two of the guards have
left now, leaving one with his back turned toward us.  Ms. Hawwa taps 
the guard on the shoulder with one of her nightsticks, striking him in 
the face with the other the moment he turns around.  The man makes a 
grunting noise upon being struck by the weapon, but he falls 
unconscious shortly after the hit.  The other two guards appear from 
the next corner now, their tonfa also drawn.  Ms. Hawwa twirls her 
weapons once more, stopping them by bending her arms in a forty-five 
degree angle.  One guard jumps forward with his weapon, only to have it
stopped by the tonfa on Ms. Hawwa&#146;s left arm.  She quickly launches her
knee upward after, striking the man in the chin.  She extends her leg 
after the knee attack, swinging it to the west and knocking him in the 
side of the face.  Another swing of her leg follows, striking him on 
the other side, and then a final one, this one striking him upward on 
the chin.  This one also falls unconscious, leaving the other guard 
shaking in place.  Ms. Hawwa approaches the other guard now, but he 
makes no attempt to move at all.  With a quick swing of the weapon on 
her right hand, she plants the weapon on the temple of the guard, 
knocking him out as well.
	
&#147;You didn&#39;t have to do that,&#148; I try to point out afterward, &#147;we could 
have just tried to sneak past them.&#148;
	
&#147;If we had waited to sneak past each guard, it&#39;d have been much 
slower,&#148; she explains.  &#147;Going through them directly will give us much 
more time.&#148;
	
&quot;It&#39;s not that, more guards might come later and...&#148;
	
&#147;Let&#146;s move on,&#148; she ignores the next words I have to say.
	
We continue down the hall until we find ourselves in a giant hangar.  
Several different A.G.W.S. units, many of which weren&#146;t even registered
in my data banks, stand here.  Despite that, much of the space in this 
area is empty; I&#146;m surprised that there aren&#146;t any guards stationed
here.
	
&#147;I guess we&#146;re almost home free then, huh?&#148; Miyuki asks.
	
Ms. Hawwa doesn&#146;t say single word, instead walking to one of the 
consoles near one of the A.G.W.S. units.  This particular unit is 
different from the rest though, it&#146;s much larger than an average 
A.G.W.S., and the design itself is also unique.  The entire machine as 
a sleek and smooth design, not a sharp point anywhere like most 
A.G.W.S.  There are two wing-like structures on the back too, and the 
cockpit looks like it can fit up to two people.
	
I turn back to Ms. Hawwa who begins to punch in a code into the console
system.  A humming noise begins to emit from the machine shortly after 
and at the same time a ladder to the cockpit appears.
	
&#147;Take it,&#148; Ms. Hawwa suddenly orders the two of us.  &#147;The E.S. Dinah is
yours.&#148;
	
&#147;Before that, there&#146;s some things I want to ask you, Ms. Hawwa,&#148; I 
address the woman.  &#147;Why are you doing all this for me?  I can 
understand Miyuki, but why you?  How is that you know my name, and who 
exactly are you?&#148;
	
The woman&#146;s eyes turn to the floor for a moment, and she says nothing.
Finally she looks back up to me and speaks.
	
&#147;I&#39;ve caused enough trouble in the past that this is a way for me to 
help make up for it,&#148; she says.
	
&#147;The past, what&#146;re you...?&#148;
	
&#147;It&#39;s time that I go,&#148; Ms. Hawwa turns away again.  &#147;I have other 
things that I must attend to.  You have many questions, but now is not 
the time to answer them.   When we meet again, you&#146;ll get your answers,
Elly.&#148;
	
Without saying another word, the mysterious woman walks out the same 
way we entered the hangar.  It&#146;s strange, Miyuki said that it was Ms. 
Hawwa&#146;s idea to rescue me, but I have no recollection of ever meeting 
her.  Still, there&#146;s something about her that I admit feels so 
familiar, something I felt not too long ago.  I&#146;m not sure how to 
describe it, but the closest word that can describe this emotion is 
nostalgia.
	
&#147;Hey KOS-MOS, are you all right?&#148; Miyuki&#146;s voice snaps me out of my 
thoughts.
	
&#147;Yeah, I&#146;m sorry,&#148; I apologize.
	
She looks at me strangely after what I had just said.  She simply 
shrugs after a few moments and begins to climb the ladder into the 
A.G.W.S. unit.  I guess it must&#146;ve been my response to my question, she
must be used to having me say something like &#147;all systems are normal.&#148;
	
I follow her into the cockpit shortly and take the main pilot seat in 
the front.  The door slowly closes on the machine after and the lights 
within the control panel turn on shortly.  The main screen shortly 
follows and I proceed to move the A.G.W.S. toward the hangar door.
	
&#147;Miyuki, do you know the code to open the hangar door?&#148; I ask.
	
&#147;One moment, I&#146;ll type it.&#148;
	
The doors open shortly after.  The city lights greet us the moment 
after; though they aren&#146;t entirely bright, they still allow our machine
to be visible to the naked eye.  I begin to think that taking this 
A.G.W.S. was a bad idea now, seeing how its size is bigger than other 
A.G.W.S.  I bang my fist against the controls after realizing this, 
there&#146;s no way we can escape using this machine, and going back inside 
the building would be a bad idea after what Ms. Hawwa did to those 
other guards.  Miyuki and I would probably be blamed for that if we 
were caught.
	
&#147;You know, this new model is different from the others,&#148; Miyuki points 
out.
	
&#147;What do you mean?&#148; I ask, trying to hold back my frustration.
	
&#147;You see that lever next to the control stick, pull it down.&#148;
	
Shrugging my shoulders, I decide to comply.  The entire unit begins to 
tremble suddenly, the cockpit slowly lowering to the ground until the 
shaking stops.
	
&#147;And what was the point of that, Miyuki?&#148; I ask in a sarcastic tone.
	
She gives me another weird look after what I had said.  She must really
be used to me not acting like this.  After a few seconds of giving me 
that weird expression, she finally explains.
	
&#147;The E.S. Dinah has two forms,&#148; she says, &#147;the usual A.G.W.S. form, and
an aircraft form.  In other words, this new A.G.W.S. is a transformable
fighter jet.  That lever you pulled alternates between the two 
different forms.&#148;
	
&#147;I see,&#148; I nod, &#147;I suppose this form won&#146;t attract much attention 
then.&#148;
	
Without wasting another second, I pull down on the control stick and 
the entire machine begins to rumble once more.  Slowly but surely the 
shaking stops as the city lights grow smaller and smaller on the main 
screen.  With the city now barely visible on the main screen, I decide 
it&#146;s time to go back to Shion&#146;s.
	
There&#146;s something that keeps bothering me though.  During our escape, 
we had only encountered three guards, none of which were in the 
A.G.W.S. hangar.  There was also the fact that there weren&#146;t any guards
outside either.  Vector is full of industrial secrets so it doesn&#146;t 
make sense why the security was so lax.  Something&#146;s just not right 
about all of this, it&#146;s almost as if they wanted me to escape and take 
this prototype.  Still, I shouldn&#146;t think about it too much, I have to 
return to Shion.

(Wilhelm&#146;s POV)

	
The stars shine as brightly as ever.  Since the beginning of time, Man 
has always looked to the stars for answers and inspiration.  All I see 
however is darkness.  The stars are merely tools to distract our eyes 
from the ever-growing darkness, tools that try to hide away the 
inevitable.
	
&#147;Master Wilhelm,&#148; my thoughts are interrupted by subordinate who 
dresses in red.  &#147;KOS-MOS and Miyuki Itsumi have just escaped 
confinement from the Second R &amp; D Division.  They have also taken the 
prototype E.S. Dinah with them, is this acceptable?&#148;
	
&#147;Yes, that&#146;s fine,&#148; I tell my subordinate, my eyes still averted toward
the eternal darkness.  &#147;KOS-MOS, or rather &#145;Miss Elly,&#146; and Ms. Itsumi 
have roles to fulfill after all, it&#146;s only fair that I allow them to 
play their part.&#148;
	
&#147;I must also report that the 100-Observational Series Realian Prototype
has also linked with the UMN,&#148; he adds to his report.  &#147;The virus that 
Albedo had installed within her has been uploaded into their system, 
and as a result, the gate of Old Miltia has opened.&#148;
	
&#147;Excellent,&#148; I turn to my subordinate.  &#147;Everyone has fulfilled their 
roles thus far.  Everything is going just as planned according to our 
Compass of Order.  All that&#146;s left is to gather the &#145;final one&#146; before 
we can retrieve the ark.&#148;

XenoMark&#146;s Note: Well, I hope this chapter was to your liking, I&#146;m 
sorry if it wasn&#146;t.  I guarantee that the next chapter will be better 
though.  As for Elly&#146;s nightmare, I&#146;m sure Xenogears fans recognize it,
and recognize the true identity of Ms. Hawwa as well.  Man, it&#146;s been 
such a hassle to actually finish this chapter, I just hope we can bring
out the next one much faster.  Well, reviews are welcome as long as 
their not flames.  Again, sorry for the long wait, hope we can get the 
next one up sooner, later people!

Shi&#39;s Note: He&#39;s right, the next chapter will be even better! 
Hopefully, when bro&#39;s not busy with his school work and I&#39;m not 
working, we can get busy on the next chapter for you guys. Until then, 
see ya.</pre>
