<h1>Tears of Toys (part 4 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/albedoright.html">Albedo's right hand</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/teartoy-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>	KOS-MOS opened her eyes knowing that Shion and Momo would be there 
to meet her crimson eyes.
	&quot;Good Morning Shion, and Momo.&quot; She calmly said knowing the daily 
routine of her awakening.
	&quot;Good to see your functioning fine KOS-MOS.&quot; Shion said with a 
smile, Momo just stood there with a soft knowing smile. Shion took out 
her connection gear and read the screen the floated above it.
	&quot;All systems are normal, a slight fluctuation in the cerebral 
systems but that could be nothing of danger. Could you flex your right 
hand for me.&quot; KOS-MOS lifted her right hand and flexed it into a fist 
tried to unfold her hand but her fingers didn&#39;t listen.
	&quot;Two of your circuit suppressors have malfunctioned causing damage 
to three of the joint motors.&quot; Shion said flatly reading the information 
on the screen. Momo looked worried,
	&quot;So how can it be repaired?&quot; Shion thought for a moment.
	&quot;Nano-machines would be the easy choice, KOS-MOS initiat repair 
mo...&quot;
	&quot;Wait! Can I do it?&quot; Both KOS-MOS and Shion looked towards Momo, 
&quot;I am capable of Nano repair, can you let me.&quot; Shion looked back at her 
connection gear.
	&quot;Guess it wouldn&#39;t hurt.&quot; Momo skipped over to the android and 
grasped the malfunctioning fist with both hands. She made sure her back 
was to Shion and let her nano machines do the work.
	KOS-MOS closed her eyes as a subtle warmth washed over her hand. 
She had been repaired by nano machines before but this was the first 
time since she has been able to feel emotions and sensations that she 
had felt the nano machines doing there job.
	A new warmth washed over her as Momo placed a light kiss on the 
newly repaired hand. She smiled sweetly as KOS-MOS soon recovered from 
the sudden rush of sensation.
	&quot;All better KOS-MOS?&quot; She asked kindly as KOS-MOS flexed her hand 
again to assure her that it was fully repaired.
	&quot;Thank you for your assistance Momo.&quot; She said in a monotone voice 
because Shion was now looking over Momo&#39;s shoulder. KOS-MOS stepped out 
of her black coffin hoping she hadn&#39;t noticed Momo&#39;s act of affection. 
Shion turned and walked towards the door.
	&quot;Thanks for the help Momo. Breakfast will be ready in 45 minutes.&quot; 
Shion chimed as she walked through the door. 
	Momo leaned towards KOS-MOS and without warning jumped at her and 
threw her arms around KOS-MOS&#39;s neck and just hung there.
	&quot;I am I going to have to kiss all your Boo Boos KOS-MOS?&quot; She said 
playfully before planting a soft kiss on the android&#39;s lips.
	&quot;I almost forgot that NATARAJA data Allen has been bugging me 
about.&quot; Shion said to herself while walking back into the room.
	KOS-MOS had a look of complete shock while Momo stammered a 
response while still hanging from her lover,
	&quot;I...I...um...Tripped.&quot; Was the only excuse she could give as 
Shion plugged her connection gear into the black coffin.
	&quot;Watch yourself Momo, it would hurt if you tripped and hit your 
head.&quot; She said with a sweet smile as Momo let her feet land silently on 
the floor. Shion soon unplugged her connection gear and walked back out 
of the room.
	KOS-MOS and Momo simply stood there until Momo started giggling,
	&quot;She may be a scientist but she can be pretty oblivious at times.&quot; 
KOS-MOS&#39;s shocked look soon vanished,
	&quot;Please Momo, no more close calls.&quot; Momo smiled coyly and replied,
	&quot;Oh I am sorry. Did I scare my Kossy-Mossy?&quot; KOS-MOS gave her a 
funny look.
	&quot;Kossy-Mossy? Could I get a different pet name?&quot; She said. Momo 
turned and ran away,
	&quot;You&#39;ll have to catch me...&quot; She was lifted a foot off the ground. 
&quot;...Note to self: Don&#39;t race with an android.&quot; KOS-MOS held her close to 
herself so that Momo&#39;s back brushed against her chest.
	&quot;Just call me KOS-MOS alright.&quot; She whispered in the realian&#39;s 
ear. Shivers traveled down the realian&#39;s spine as blood rushed to her 
face. Momo hung her head to try and hide the fact she had gotten hot and 
bothered over just a few words.
	&quot;Are you alright Momo?&quot; KOS-MOS asked, detecting the sudden rush 
of blood to Momo&#39;s face. Momo blushed even brighter as an image 
materialized in the back of her brain.
	&quot;I fine really.&quot; She said as she tried in vain to remove the 
thought from her head.
	
	&quot;Stupid Gaignun thinking he is some kind of shrink!&quot; Jr. yelled 
slamming his small fist on the desk. &quot;How dare he say those things. He 
has no right!&quot; He leaned back in his chair that was obviously a size too 
big for him. He tried to calm his nerves but everything he thought about 
only added more fuel to the fire. 
	&quot;Damn it! It&#39;s like the whole galaxy is out to get me!&quot; he yelled 
in frustration as he stood up and stormed over to the pool table. He 
lifted his small frame onto the edge and stared out through the window 
into the cold emptiness of space.
	Jr. groaned as an image of him and Momo kissing flashed through 
his head. He remembered everything he did with her and how he now knew 
he only was using her to fill the hole Sakura left behind in his heart.
	He remembered how her lips were exactly the same, in texture and 
taste. He remembered how there smiles was completely the same. Momo was 
like a painting depicting the image of beauty, but she was only the 
image and not the person.
	He slumped backward and lay flat on the pool table, but felt the 
hard surface of the eight ball jamming into his small spinal cords. Jr. 
reached behind him and grabbed the eight ball and flung it over his head 
towards the door. He was too angry to realize that the ball never hit 
the ground.
	He stood up and looked out the window, just before the eight ball 
collided with the back of his head.
	&quot;Didn&#39;t you ever hear the old saying that people in glass houses 
shouldn&#39;t throw eight balls?&quot; Came the voice of Captain Matthews. 
	&quot;What are you here for?&quot; Jr. spat with venom in his voice. 
Matthews readjusted his &quot;I am a Boozer&quot; hat and said,
	&quot;The this year&#39;s financial documents.&quot; Jr. ran over to his desk 
and pretended to flip through his book,
	&quot;Hmm...let me see, it says STILL IN DEBT! What difference does it 
make anymore if you know the number?&quot; Jr. yelled,
	&quot;No Little Master. Mary and Shelly just sent me for the Durandle&#39;s 
financial reports.&quot; Jr. opened another drawer and pulled out a CD.
	&quot;Here now leave me alone!&quot; He said tossing the small black object 
to the Elsa&#39;s Captain. Matthews crossed his arms,
	&quot;What seems to be the problem...Friends? Family? Girlfriend?&quot; Jr. 
twitched at the last words and Matthews knew the answer all too soon,
	&quot;Must have been a bad break up. I know what that feels like.&quot; Jr. 
was clenching his fists and shot back,
	&quot;You? With a woman? That&#39;s about as likely as you having money!&quot; 
Matthews was unfazed by the remark and replied,
	&quot;Let the Elsa crew help you. We may be poor bastards but we know 
how to cheer people up.&quot; Jr. stormed over to him and tried to push him 
through the threshold but his size prevented him,
	&quot;Damn it! I break up with a girl and suddenly every guy on this 
ship is out to give me a heartfelt man to man discussion!&quot; Matthews took 
the hint and turned to leave,
	&quot;Come to the bar on the Elsa some time if words won&#39;t help liquor 
will.&quot; Jr. slammed the door.
	&quot;Damn it! Do all these people spy on me or something?&quot; He turned 
around and walked to his desk but the eight ball found its way under his 
foot and he landed hard on his back.
	&quot;STUPID BALL!&quot; He screamed as the sound of a gunshot rang through 
the room.
