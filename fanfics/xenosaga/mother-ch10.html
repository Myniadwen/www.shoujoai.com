<a href="../xenosaga/mother-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>XenoMark&#39;s Note: I&#39;m really sorry for the delay in updating, work and 
school have been keeping me busy, not to mention I&#39;ve been sick for 
quite a while. Well now that the semester&#39;s over (and the new one just 
beginning), I&#39;ve had some time to work on this fic. Anyways, in this 
chapter we get a bit more history on Jr. and Citrine, along with the 
party finally finding the Zohar. This chapter is mostly action-packed 
after going through the U.R.T.V.&#39;s&#39; past, so please be patient. Also, a 
special character finally makes her appearance, but you&#39;ll have to wait 
until the end of the chapter to find out who that special character is. 
Not sure what else to say, so let&#39;s get back to the story.

----------

Purpose

(Jr.&#39;s POV)

Labyrinthos, the source of all my misery, I thought I could run away 
from it, but somehow it dragged me back in. Yuriev, I should&#39;ve known 
he&#39;d have some sort trick of his sleeve to come back like that. After 
what happened fourteen years ago, I thought it was over, it was all done 
with after what Gaignun and I did. All that pain and heartache, I never 
thought I would have to feel what I did that day again, but now that I&#39;m 
back here, I can&#39;t help but remember.

It was the two days after Gaignun and I escaped Labyrinthos, the two of 
us were reported to be the only survivors of our last mission. Because 
of the failure of the mission, civilians of Old Miltia were ordered to 
evacuate the planet, but the process was slow, it would take them two 
full days in order to evacuate everyone. During this time, the other 
U.R.T.V.&#39;s had been mobilized to try and eradicate U-DO along with the 
Miltian Special Forces, and among those forces, were chaos and Canaan. 
During the battles, Gaignun and I were recovering in the U.R.T.V. 
institute after the failed mission. I remember I was in my barracks 
during that time, my thoughts replaying the events that had occurred two 
days prior.

&quot;Rubedo?&quot; a knock fell on my door early that morning.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; I called to the person on the other side. &quot;Come in, Nigredo.&quot;

Gaignun&#39;s wounds weren&#39;t as serious as I thought they were that day, he 
only needed a day&#39;s worth of nanotherapy in order to recover. The 
therapy couldn&#39;t cure all our wounds though, I knew when I looked in 
Gaignun&#39;s eyes that he still felt guilty for abandoning Albedo. It just 
wasn&#39;t fair; the only one who was brave enough to stand up to Yuriev in 
the past, the only one to stand up for what was right, had died, and the 
two of us, the cowards who didn&#39;t do anything, had lived.

&quot;How long have the others been mobilized?&quot; Gaignun asked as he took a 
seat on the bed next to mine.

&quot;Six hours,&quot; I replied.

&quot;I see...&quot;

Silence fell between us quickly afterwards. We both knew that the 
remaining U.R.T.V. forces weren&#39;t enough to stop U-DO, that they were 
only going to be used as decoys as the civilians escaped. It was all my 
fault why Old Miltia was destroyed, if I hadn&#39;t broken the link back 
then, if I had risked all our lives in order to contain U-DO, then maybe 
none of this would be happening in the present. Yuriev would have 
probably died in time with no U.R.T.V. bodies left to take over, Albedo 
wouldn&#39;t have gone crazy, Citrine wouldn&#39;t have become a Testament, and 
the people in the Foundation wouldn&#39;t have been taken hostage. It really 
is all my fault.

&quot;...Rubedo, let&#39;s get out of here,&quot; Gaignun suddenly spoke.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I said let&#39;s get out of here,&quot; Gaignun repeated himself.

&quot;Wait, get out of here? What are you talking about?&quot; I didn&#39;t understand 
what he was talking about at the time.

&quot;Come on, Rubedo, if we stay here, we&#39;re gonna die,&quot; Gaignun explained. 
&quot;Think of it, Yuriev doesn&#39;t care about us at all, he&#39;ll just send us 
out there eventually where we&#39;ll definitely be killed.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s something Albedo would say,&quot; I remarked. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t matter, 
we deserve to die anyway.&quot;

&quot;And just why is that!&quot; Gaignun exploded.

&quot;Don&#39;t the deaths of Albedo and Citrine mean anything to you!&quot; I snapped 
back. &quot;It&#39;s because of us that they&#39;re dead! The two of us ran when they 
needed us the most, and because we let them down, we don&#39;t deserve to 
live.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a lie, Rubedo, and you know it! Albedo knew that we were all 
going to die eventually, but he always dreamed about finding his own 
place in the world. He even stood up to Yuriev about his beliefs and 
staying friends with us even though we didn&#39;t! I know he wanted all of 
us to do the same, so I say why not? Why should we fight for a man who 
doesn&#39;t care about our well-being, why should we risk our lives when we 
haven&#39;t truly lived yet? Why Rubedo? Why should we fight?&quot;

&quot;Because we&#39;re not worthy of living!&quot; I answered hotly. &quot;Because we&#39;ll 
only fail those we cared about time and time again, so it&#39;d be better if 
we didn&#39;t care at all!&quot;

&quot;Do you really believe that, Rubedo?&quot; Gaignun began to soften his tone. 
&quot;Do you believe it&#39;d be better if Sakura didn&#39;t feel the way she does 
about you?&quot;

Those very words were a swift blow to me, a quick strike to my heart. 
Sakura Mizrahi, the only person that I felt truly mattered to me back 
then. It was at that very moment that I realized how much she had 
changed me, from being a very objective person into an emotional young 
man. I had no idea what emotions or feelings would be if it weren&#39;t for 
her, and not having her care about me anymore, I would feel... sad.

&quot;...you&#39;re right, Nigredo,&quot; I said after a moment of taking his words to 
heart. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be fair to Sakura if I stayed here. Let&#39;s get 
out of here,&quot; I agreed with absolute resolution. &quot;We won&#39;t be used by 
anyone ever again.&quot;

&quot;How touching,&quot; a familiar hoarse voice spoke soon. &quot;Am I supposed to be 
touched that my little creations have decided to finally leave the 
nest?&quot;

&quot;Yuriev!&quot; the two of us quickly recognized the man now standing in the 
entrance to my barracks.

&quot;Any parent would be glad when their child decides to finally think for 
themselves and express their own independence,&quot; our &quot;father&quot; continued 
as he walked forward, his hands slipped into his pockets. &quot;To raise one 
and mold them into their own existence, that is the purpose of being a 
family, but then again, we are no ordinary family, are we?&quot; he stopped 
before us, revealing his teeth with a grin.

&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; Gaignun asked, puzzled by his words.

&quot;You belong to me,&quot; he simply answered, &quot;you will always belong to me.&quot;

&quot;Belong to you?&quot; his words made no sense in my ears either.

&quot;Yes. Who was it that supplied you with the genes required for your 
existence? Me. Who was it that raised you throughout your entire life 
thus far? Me. Who was it that trained you, who formed you into the young 
men you are today? Me. Everything points to me, Rubedo, Nigredo, and 
thus, your entire existence is centered on myself. If I am the center, 
then everything will crumble apart without me. I decide how you live 
your lives,&quot; he began to raise his voice. &quot;I decide who you will be. I 
decide where you will go. I decide everything. Without me, you would 
cease to exist as you are now, I am your everything, I am the center of 
your existence, I AM YOUR GOD!&quot;

The madness inside him was as strong as ever as he spoke; the fire in 
his eyes, the wind behind his breath, the earth trembling at his feet, 
it felt as if the entire world was crumbling down on us. This is how it 
felt whenever we tried to stand up against him in the past, how 
everything seemed to fall apart with just his very presence. How was it 
possible to fight a world that was crumbling before you? For the longest 
time I did not know how Albedo was able to challenge such a thing, but 
during that moment, I finally understood how.

&quot;God?&quot; I asked, his definition no longer having any meaning in my mind. 
&quot;Who made you God?&quot;

&quot;What!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true that you created us with your own genes, it&#39;s true that you 
raised us, but it wasn&#39;t you who turned us into who we are today!&quot; I 
yelled, opposing our &quot;father&quot; for the first time in my life. &quot;Each of us 
became who we are now because of our own experiences! If it were up to 
you, we would have been nothing more than emotionless beings, nothing 
but killing machines who blindly follow orders, not even caring what the 
consequences were. We discovered who we truly were however, realizing 
the truth with every moment we spent together with one another. You say 
you&#39;re the center of our existence, but the truth is all you&#39;ve tried to 
do is manipulate our own! We won&#39;t let you do that ever again, do you 
hear me, Yuriev! We&#39;re through with doing what you want!&quot;

&quot;You dare speak that way to me!&quot;

My body began to fall to the floor immediately after, my right cheek 
throbbing after. Before I could recover from the blow however, I found 
another jolt of pain being exerted into me as the feeling of hardened 
leather met with my stomach. The edge of his shoe struck me two more 
times, a warm rush of fluid crawling further and further up my throat 
with each strike. I tried to prepare myself for a the impact of a third 
kick by curling my body inward, but the attack never came.

Gaignun had managed to wrap his arms around Yuriev&#39;s neck, choking him 
as he tried to pull him to the floor at the same time. Our father slowly 
started to succumb to Gaignun&#39;s weight as he hung onto him, desperately 
trying to reach behind him to tear him away. It looked like Gaignun had 
the upper hand at first, but before Yuriev could fall, he quickly backed 
into the nearest wall, ramming Gaignun&#39;s back into it. The first push 
quickly loosened Gaignun&#39;s grip, the second causing him to fall.

&quot;How dare you both defy me!&quot; Yuriev spat between his breaths. &quot;To defy 
your creator is the equivalent of death, and for doing so, I&#39;ll gladly 
bring each of you to the other side.&quot;

He began to reach into his pocket at this time, revealing a small 
handgun in a manner of seconds. The barrel began to point itself at 
Gaignun now, Yuriev&#39;s thumb beginning to pull back on the weapon&#39;s 
hammer. My body quickly shot up at this moment, my legs moving me toward 
our creator in a second. Out of instinct I dove forward, my entire body 
meeting with his right arm and causing the gun to fall out of his hand 
and sliding across the floor. The two of us met with the ground soon 
after, my hand already inching toward the gun. My finger began to touch 
the barrel, but before I could get a good grip, I found my entire body 
suddenly being pulled back. The top of my skull was the target this 
time, a pair of knuckles striking down on it in quick successions. I 
couldn&#39;t help but cry out in pain with every punch that met with my 
head, the strength to reach for the firearm waning with every one. 
Everything around me was beginning to blur at that moment, the scenery 
becoming black. I swear I could see the Death standing in front of me at 
that moment, but then...

&quot;Let him go!&quot; the sound of a trigger being pulled back followed after 
hearing these words.

&quot;Nigredo...?&quot; I looked up to barely see his silhouette.

Though everything was still hazy, I was still able to see the trembling 
in Gaignun&#39;s knees and I could hear him inhaling sharply. The attacks 
had come to a halt now, I turned to my side to find Yuriev beginning to 
back away from me. Even without looking at him, I knew Yuriev was as 
collective as ever, I knew that he could also sense the fear that was 
going through Gaignun at that moment.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing, Nigredo?&quot; our &#39;father&#39; asked, as sure 
of himself as ever.

&quot;G-get away from Rubedo,&quot; the younger U.R.T.V. ordered with a stutter.

&quot;And just what do you intend to do about it?&quot; Yuriev continued, stepping 
forward now.

&quot;St-stay back!&quot;

&quot;Come Nigredo, we both know you don&#39;t have what it takes to pull the 
trigger. I know you&#39;re not the kind to betray one who has done so much 
for you. You&#39;re not the same as this weakling.&quot;

&quot;Nigredo, don&#39;t listen to him!&quot; I yelled.

&quot;You are the last of my great children, Nigredo, I know you are destined 
for greatness. Why forsake your future for your older brother who lies 
on the floor, ready to pass over at any moment?&quot;

&quot;I told you to stay back!&quot;

&quot;Give me the gun, Nigredo. That gun is more than just a weapon, it is a 
key. That key will lead you to the future, if you give me that key, I 
can ensure that your future will be great, so...&quot;

Not another word was spoken after that sentence; the sound of a bang and 
a ping were the only things that echoed after. The images before me 
began to focus once again with that pull of the trigger, the image of 
Yuriev bringing his hand toward his heart was as clear as day. After a 
few moments of standing, his hand began to fall from his chest, his palm 
covered with a large botch of blood. His knees were the first to meet 
with the ground, followed by his face and the rest of his body. With his 
body no longer blocking my view, I saw Gaignun standing there, his 
entire body locked with his arms still pointed forward and the gun in 
his hand still smoking.

&quot;Nigredo...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, that gun was a key to my future...,&quot; he began to speak to 
the newly-made corpse, &quot;a future without you.&quot;

&quot;Jr.! MOMO!&quot; a voice interrupts my thoughts of the past.

&quot;Allen? Canaan?&quot; I look up to find them approaching me.

&quot;Thank god you&#39;re all right,&quot; Allen breathes a sigh of relief.

&quot;Yeah, I can say the same about you guys,&quot; I tell them.

&quot;Hey MOMO, are you okay?&quot; Allen asks as she continues to cling on to me.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she begins to pull away now, rubbing away the now dry 
tears, &quot;I was just a little upset, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;What about everyone else, where are they?&quot; Allen questions.

&quot;Citrine and chaos went ahead,&quot; I answer, &quot;but I don&#39;t know what 
happened to the others.&quot;

&quot;This facility...,&quot; Canaan begins, &quot;do you think it will be sufficient 
enough to remove that burden I&#39;ve been storing all this time?&quot;

&quot;The systems here are a bit dated, but I think it will work,&quot; Allen 
answers.

&quot;Can you do it?&quot; Canaan asks.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know how to use these facilities, so...,&quot;

&quot;I can do it,&quot; MOMO interrupts. &quot;Just sit yourself over there,&quot; she 
points to a realian maintenance chair at one end of the room.

There she goes again, trying to pretend nothing happened. I hate it when 
I have to see her sad or distressed, but it hurts me even more to see 
her try and pretend that she&#39;s okay; I can&#39;t bear to see it, it reminds 
me too much of myself back then. Our reason for existing was to 
eradicate U-DO, that&#39;s what Citrine and Yuriev always said. I never 
wanted to believe that, but now I can&#39;t help but believe after 
everything that&#39;s happened lately. Hopefully all of it can end today, 
end when we retrieve the Zohar.

----------

(Citrine&#39;s POV)

This boy that is with me now, who is he exactly? I heard from Voyager 
that he had taken out three mass-produced KOS-MOS units easily, without 
a single scratch. I also found it strange that he allowed me to contact 
the KOS-MOS archetype, in fact, he was the one who brought it up. I&#39;ve 
never been informed of any reports of someone such as he, but could it 
be that he is the one that...?

&quot;That was rather kind of you,&quot; the boy in question suddenly speaks.

&quot;What?&quot; his words stop me in my tracks.

&quot;The way you allowed Jr. to stay back there with MOMO,&quot; he explains, &quot;it 
was nice of you to let Jr. comfort her in a time of great distress.&quot;

&quot;...Whatever,&quot; I try to brush off his words.

&quot;You have a good heart, Citrine,&quot; chaos continues, &quot;I just wish that you 
showed it to others more often. No, not just you, though he has been 
somewhat corrupted by your father&#39;s influence, your brother, Albedo, he 
also...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t ever mention that weakling&#39;s name to me!&quot; I prevent the boy from 
saying anything further.

&quot;Do you not think so?&quot; he continues to pester me. &quot;Even you must 
acknowledge that he has done much for you in your childhood; in times of 
distress...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true! A U.R.T.V. is not supposed to feel anything! Our only 
reason for being is to eradicate U-DO, everything else is a trivial 
matter!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you didn&#39;t think it was trivial back then.&quot;

&quot;...just what do you know?&quot;

Out of all the U.R.T.V.&#39;s that were most defiant of our father back 
then, it had to be that weakling. Albedo, the one who strived to be 
human the most, I could never understand what was going inside his head, 
then and now. All I know is he tried to assimilate the others into his 
ways, namely the other Variants. It was that attitude that won the 
affection of the Kirschwassers; the ideas of pity and happiness, a 
U.R.T.V. needs none of these things, so why did he have to try and show 
me these things?

Nearly after every incident with Yuriev, I always found myself huddling 
in a corner crying. I never did dare show those tears to our father back 
then, I knew that if I were to show such a thing, he would only make 
things worse. He always enjoyed seeing others in grief, he found great 
joy in seeing others&#39; anguish. I don&#39;t know why I always found myself 
crying after every evening I spent with him, I knew that a U.R.T.V. was 
not supposed to feel anything, and yet, no matter how many times I told 
myself that, I would still weep. It was all his fault, the way he always 
tried to act upon those emotions. Albedo, even though I wanted nothing 
to do with such feelings, he always stirred something within me. That 
optimistic view, his bright smile, everything about him made something 
burn within me. This hatred and contempt I have for him, these are the 
only emotions I admit to have felt back then. I can think of many 
instances when he tried to force his beliefs on me, but one particular 
incident stands out the most in my mind.

It was a few hours after another one of my private evenings with Yuriev, 
a few hours he had fallen asleep. I had snuck out of his bedroom after 
he had his way with me, my entire body shaking and searing from within. 
Liquid was once again escaping my eyes, but there was no way I could let 
him or anyone else see me like that. I didn&#39;t want to seem like a 
disgrace to the U.R.T.V. Forces, I didn&#39;t want to seem weak. I had 
ventured out into the park of the institute, huddling on one of the 
benches as my arms hugged my sides, as if they were taking the pain 
away. I thought no one was there at that late hour, but I was wrong. Of 
all the people to see me in such a vulnerable state, it was him.

&quot;Why are you crying, Citrine?&quot; were the first words that came out of his 
mouth.

Albedo, one could never know when that weakling was ever around; every 
time I was ever in any sort of pain, he was there to see it. With every 
incident, he always had that same look on his face, a look of concern. I 
could tell what he was trying to do, he was trying to take pity on me 
just so that I could acknowledge those emotions I tried so hard to 
suppress.

&quot;...Get away from me, I have nothing to say to you!&quot; I spat after he 
asked his question.

I turned away from him after my words, my arms clinging onto my sides 
even tighter. I felt his hand fall upon my shoulder a second later, but 
I quickly shoved it away by pulling my body to the side. My eyes had 
constricted after feeling the warmth of his palm, my body quickly 
getting off the bench so that I may move away from him. My body wouldn&#39;t 
let me travel far however, for the pain inside me had intensified with 
the first step I took, the pain quickly shooting through my entire body, 
forcing me to fall toward the ground.

&quot;Citrine!&quot; the weakling cried as he tried to rush to my aid.

&quot;I told you to get away from me!&quot; I repeated, tossing his hand aside 
once more.

I tried to walk once again, but I found myself falling again within two 
steps. My hands had barely caught myself from falling to the muddy soil, 
but it seemed like all the muscles in my arms were turning into fire. It 
hurt to simply crawl there, the inferno only intensifying with every 
second. I wasn&#39;t able to keep my place for long, and before I knew it, I 
found the rest of my body falling toward the bemired floor. I did not 
meet with the ground however, for my fall had been halted by the one I 
had tried to push away.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; the pathetic excuse for a U.R.T.V. asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t want your help!&quot; I began to scream at him, my fist beginning to 
pound on his chest. &quot;I don&#39;t need your help! Get off me! Let me go!&quot;

My hands began to pound at his chest relentlessly at this point, my 
attacks doing nothing to loosen his hold on me. Every strike had little 
strength in them, and every one that followed only grew weaker. The 
blaze inside me had only worsened with every attempted blow, but now 
those flames had found themselves in my eyes. The flames from behind my 
eyelids had now manifested into liquid, my voice hiccupping and cracking 
with every cry of my attacks. Finally the fires of anger had died within 
my body, but they were as bright as ever in my eyes. The rivers of 
sadness were as rapid as ever, all of my strength now pouring out of 
them. My hands that were pounding against his chest were now clinging 
onto the fabric of his shirt, barely dragging them down as my body sank 
to the floor. Albedo wouldn&#39;t let me go as I sank, he only continued to 
hold me, falling with me.

&quot;Why? Why am I crying?&quot; I asked myself between my whimpers. &quot;A U.R.T.V. 
isn&#39;t supposed to feel anything no matter what happens, and yet...!&quot;

&quot;Though we were made to be weapons, there is one thing we are first and 
foremost no matter what anyone says,&quot; Albedo began to answer. &quot;Yes, we 
were created to destroy U-DO, yes we are not allowed to mingle with 
society, but does that not make us human, Citrine? All of us, every 
member of the U.R.T.V. Forces is supposed to be a clone of Dimitri 
Yuriev, who is also a human being. If we are copies of that man, then 
doesn&#39;t that also make us human?&quot;

&quot;But why me, Albedo? Why do I have to feel such things! The 
non-Variants, they&#39;re not as strong as us, they have no special 
qualities, but they feel nothing. So why do I, one of the Variants, one 
of the elite, have to such a weakness!&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re human, Citrine, human like everyone else,&quot; he answered, 
&quot;and as a human, you can&#39;t help but feel. It isn&#39;t something to be 
ashamed of, it&#39;s something to cherish because it separates us from other 
living things. So please, Citrine, don&#39;t be so hard on yourself. Just 
let it all out, just this one time.&quot;

I could say no more words after that For the first time in my life, I 
had followed Albedo&#39;s advice. My arms began to wrap around his body and 
my face buried into his shoulder. The tears began to fall more freely 
now, my voice breaking and hiccupping as it did so. The boy only sat 
there with me, his own arms wrapped around me body and cheek nestling 
with my forehead. I had cried that entire evening, but not once during 
that time did Albedo move. During the entire time, he only sat there, 
holding me, taking away my tears until the rise of the morning sun.

When morning came and the tears had dried, I felt as if a great burden 
had been lifted from my shoulders. The pain from the events from last 
night had night gone away, I found myself with renewed strength, as if I 
could take on the entire world.

&quot;Are you all right now?&quot; he asked once I had stopped crying.

&quot;...yeah.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad to hear that,&quot; he smiled. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll be heading back 
to my quarters then.&quot;

The boy had released his hold on me after that, a cold air suddenly 
swirling around my body the moment he began to turn away. I don&#39;t know 
what it was that caused this air, and I still don&#39;t know to this very 
day. The weather itself was not cold, nor was my body shivering. What I 
do know is that my body had grown warm again when I did what I did next.

&quot;Albedo,&quot; my words stopped him in his tracks. &quot;...thank you for what you 
did last night.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; he looked back with that smile still on his face.

&quot;Um...,&quot; I found myself speechless afterwards, my foot digging into the 
ground as I thought of something else to say.

I don&#39;t know why I stopped him, all I know is that I wanted that warmth 
to remain. It was nothing like I had felt before; my stomach was in 
knots, my cheeks flushed, and my throat parched. Under any other 
circumstance none of these things would be welcome, but for some reason, 
at that moment, they never felt so relaxing. For the first and only 
time, I felt time and been frozen as I contemplated on what to say, but 
he was the first to speak, his words only adding more fervor to what I 
was already feeling.

&quot;If you ever feel like crying again, I&#39;ll be here,&quot; Albedo told me.

&quot;R...really?&quot; I found myself stuttering.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; he nodded.

&quot;Cry?&quot; I scoffed. &quot;A U.R.T.V. needs no such thing such as emotions.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just like you,&quot; he said with a slight chuckle.

&quot;Listen, I&#39;d appreciate it if you didn&#39;t tell anybody about what 
happened last night,&quot; I suddenly found myself telling the boy.

&quot;Now this is weird, are you actually asking me to do something for you?&quot; 
he began to chuckle again.

&quot;Just promise me, okay!&quot; I began to yell.

&quot;All right, all right, I promise,&quot; he smiled.

&quot;...that weakling, Albedo,&quot; I begin to speak to chaos once again in the 
present, &quot;he... didn&#39;t do a thing for me back then. One as pathetic as 
he had no place in the U.R.T.V. Forces whatsoever, and so, he has no 
significance to me whatsoever.&quot;

&quot;...I see,&quot; the silver-hair boy nods. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for bringing it up.&quot;

&quot;Whatever, like it matters.&quot;

We begin to go on our way again, the boy leading the way. The moment I 
take a step however, I remember Albedo&#39;s words from back then once 
again.

&quot;If you ever need to cry again, I&#39;ll be here.&quot;

&quot;Be here?&quot; I begin to speak to myself. &quot;You said you&#39;d be there, but you 
weren&#39;t. Where were you during those times, Albedo? Where were you when 
I wanted to cry?&quot;

&quot;Citrine,&quot; the mysterious boy begins to interrupt me once again, &quot;is 
something the matter?&quot;

I realize now that a tear has begun running down my cheek, the streak it 
created still fresh. I quickly brush the tiny stream away with my 
finger, removing any trace it may have left on my face.

&quot;Nothing&#39;s the matter,&quot; I tell chaos.

&#39;Where, Albedo, where were you when I wanted to cry?&#39;

----------

(Jin&#39;s POV)

Lately there has been nothing between tension between my sister and I. 
Nearly every time we spoke to one another, we would end up bickering. I 
never enjoyed the fighting, but right now, I would rather prefer it as 
opposed to what is happening right now.

&quot;I&#39;m only a copy,&quot; my sister continues to mutter the same words to 
herself. &quot;I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only a copy.&quot;

For so long I have hidden the truth of her birth to her, trying so 
desperately to push her away from any clues or paths that would lead her 
to know. Tragedy was no stranger to Shion, but despite all the happiness 
she tried to show on the outside, I always knew how badly she was 
hurting on the inside. I knew she never recovered from our parents&#39; 
deaths, and I especially knew she never recovered from her fiancee&#39;s 
death either. Despite all this sadness and despite trying to keep the 
truth from her, I knew that the truth would reach her eventually, but 
never like this and never this soon.

&quot;Shion, stop it,&quot; Miss Elly tries to silence her with a tight embrace. 
&quot;Stop saying such things, please.&quot;

My sister&#39;s words are bringing tears to her lover&#39;s eyes. It was wrong 
of me to accuse Miss Elly of still being a part of the Zohar Project, 
and it was most definitely wrong that I accused her of charming my 
sister for such a thing. I cannot bear to watch the two, I can only turn 
my eyes to the darkness that enshrouds us. Even when I turn away, I can 
still hear them, hear their tortured souls.

The darkness now begins to peel away from our surroundings, the magenta 
atmosphere that had enveloped us from the other side of the metal doors 
begins to glow around us once again. In seconds, the strangely-colored 
surroundings begin to disappear as well, replaced by giant metal walls 
that enclose us in a hangar-like room with railing at the north end. I 
draw my katana at this point, my fingers wrapping around the hilt 
tightly as the scenery changes back into the purplish-pink ambience. The 
shifting area continues to change with the passage of time, but there is 
one thing that does not change in either place. At the north end of this 
constantly changing room there is an object, a device which every 
faction of the universe is after, a relic that has done nothing but 
brought grief to my family.

&quot;The Zohar?&quot; I begin to walk toward the gold cross.

The sound of my footsteps are the only thing that echoes within the 
vicinity, but they are soon followed by those of Miss Elly&#39;s as she 
drags Shion&#39;s feet with hers. My heart is beating slowly but deeply, 
almost like the ringing of a gong. My eyes are unblinking, they can&#39;t 
help but stare at the gem-like structure in the vertex of the cross 
which seems to stare right back at me. Finally, after fourteen long 
years, I have located the source of my family&#39;s misery. I can&#39;t allow 
anyone to get a hold of it, no matter what the cost. I can&#39;t allow 
anyone else to be hurt by this relic!

&quot;Ah!&quot; I turn around to find Miss Elly suddenly hunching over, her hands 
forcing themselves against her ears.

&quot;Miss Elly, what&#39;s wrong!&quot; I quickly rush to her side.

&quot;No, that&#39;s not who I am...,&quot; her words puzzle me. &quot;Incomplete? What are 
you talking about? No, stop it, I don&#39;t want to hear any of it, stop 
it!&quot;

What&#39;s going on here? First there was that vision of the past and now 
Miss Elly is suddenly starting to have fits. She seems to be hearing 
something, but I can&#39;t hear anything but her voice and my sister&#39;s. The 
Zohar, could it be that she is reacting to the voice of the Zohar?

&quot;S...set them free,&quot; Miss Elly continues to babble what sounds like 
nonsense. &quot;Shion, she wants you to set them free.&quot;

&quot;Set them free, what are you talking about?&quot; I try to ask Miss Elly. 
&quot;Who is Shion supposed to set free?&quot;

Before I can get an answer, the entire room begins to shake. The sound 
of metal shifting and cogs turning screeches in my ears now, the moving 
noise coming from the floor below, where the base of the Zohar stands. I 
quickly turn to the source to find the metal flooring closest to the 
Zohar moving. Several rows of metal oval devices begin to protrude out 
of the ground where the floor once laid, each of these capsules 
surrounding the lower part of the relic. The noise comes a halt the 
moment the capsules come into full view, and with that, Miss Elly stops 
speaking further, her hands also removing themselves from her ears.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; I ask Miss Elly after.

&quot;...I think so,&quot; she answers. &quot;I thought I heard something, and then...&quot;

&quot;...And then?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing,&quot; she brushes off my question. &quot;But those capsules 
over there, what are they?&quot;

&quot;They look like some sort of holding device for biological creatures, 
but they&#39;re too small to hold any sort of human being,&quot; I answer. &quot;I&#39;ll 
go take a look.&quot;

I hurry over to the railing that keeps separates the Zohar and the 
platform we&#39;re on to find a ladder which leads to the depths that 
contain the capsules. I climb down the ladder to find myself amidst all 
the capsules, each of them several heads shorter than me, about as tall 
as my waist. Each of these strange devices are free from rust despite 
being unaccounted for in fourteen years. Water also drips from each of 
them, indicating that they have been frozen for so long. I then begin to 
notice that there is a piece of fogged up glass on each of them, but 
what is on the other side of the glass is a mystery to me.

I take one of the sleeves of my kimono now and begin to rub it against 
the fogged glass. The layer of vapor is rather thick, I find nothing new 
on the inside of the device. It is clear however that the vapor is on 
the outside of the glass and not on the inside as I have managed to 
remove a bit of it. I continue to scrub at the surface, scrubbing for 
about a minute until I finally see something moving on the inside. 
Whatever is inside is heaving, almost how a person breathes. I decide to 
look closer so that I may get a better idea of what it is I am looking 
at. When I do get a glimpse, I can&#39;t help but nearly fall over, shocked 
by what I have found on the other side.

Though the figure is disfigured in some manner, it is obviously the body 
of a realian. The figure looks to be no older than an eight-year old. 
The rest of the vapor begins to clear on its own now, as does the layers 
of fog on the other capsules. The deformed figures have all had their 
limbs lopped off, their skin rotting despite being in the frozen 
environment they were kept in. Each of them has some sort of breathing 
device and other mechanical components connected to their muscles. I 
find the contents within stomach beginning to crawl up my stomach now; 
it is not the image of these Realians that make me sick, it is the fact 
that I knew the one resting before me and the one to the left of her.

Cecilia, Catherine, these are the names of the younger sisters of my 
mother&#39;s nurse, the names of the two children who often played with 
Shion when she was still a little child. To see them like this, I can&#39;t 
help but... Set them free, I think I understand now, Shion had told me 
that Febronia had wanted her to set Cecily and Cathe free in a vision. 
What Miss Elly was saying just a moment ago must have been Febronia&#39;s 
words, but it would be impossible to free them in their current state. 
If we were to disconnect them from these devices, they would...!

Clang! The sound of metal crashing against one another abruptly 
interrupts my thoughts. Another crash follows soon after, along with the 
sounds of Miss Elly struggling. I try to forget about what I just saw so 
that I may hurry back up the ladder to see what is going on, not taking 
a second to look back. Before I can even place my foot on the first rung 
however, I notice a faint glimmer from the edge of my eye. Out of 
instinct I draw my katana once more in the direction of the shine, 
finding my weapon locking with another for a mere second. The force 
behind the enemy&#39;s sword pushes me away at this moment, knocking me 
against one of the Realian containers. Both my hands take hold of my 
weapon now as I prepare for the next attack. My body begins to relax 
however, not out of the fact that there is no danger, but due to the 
shock I find when I see the face of the man who tried to attack me.

&quot;You...!&quot; I barely voice. &quot;But that&#39;s impossible, you died fourteen 
years ago when...!&quot;

&quot;Is that how you address a superior officer, Uzuki?&quot; my nemesis gloats.

&quot;You&#39;re as sure of yourself as ever, Colonel Margulis,&quot; I say as I 
regain my composure.

&quot;And you haven&#39;t changed one bit, Uzuki,&quot; the Colonel simpers. &quot;Still so 
easy to surprise, but no matter, I too would be surprised to find 
someone I thought I had killed to still be standing, after all, it was a 
mere coincidence that I was within the same vicinity where &#39;he&#39; had 
business,&quot; my enemy explains. &quot;Back then, if those with the &#39;will&#39; were 
not there, I would have died. I lived however, lived so that I may 
return the favor of what you and Hyuga did to me back then. I had not 
expected to achieve revenge today however, for I have come here under 
the orders of another.&quot;

&quot;And just what are those orders?&quot; I ask as my eyes begin to narrow.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you already know what you need to know,&quot; the Colonel answers. 
&quot;Your sister, she&#39;s a very special person, my superiors have always had 
great interest in her. Yes, her and that orphan you&#39;ve been taking care 
of. Abel, wasn&#39;t it? Both of them play key roles in what my superiors 
have in store for this universe, supporting roles that are necessary for 
the main attraction.&quot;

&quot;And just what do those roles entail?&quot;

&quot;That is for you to find out...,&quot; he begins to raise his sword once 
again, &quot;on the other side!&quot;

Colonel Margulis charges forward now, his sword slicing through the air 
as he holds it a few inches above the ground. I swing my blade down the 
moment his begins to rise, but the strength in my arms is not enough to 
hammer it into the wall. My opponent quickly recovers from this attack 
before I can strike again, our next attacks locking our blades once 
again. The weapons only lock for a mere second as the two go for another 
attack, but I am forced to go on the defensive this time as he aims his 
sword at my side. I manage to block the attack but am forced to step 
back as he moves forward. Again and again our swords clash against the 
other&#39;s blade, clashing back and forth trying to overpower one another.

It is obvious that he is trying to force me back into one of the realian 
containers so that I may lose my balance upon backing into one. Much to 
his dismay however, I manage to pass through the tiny corridors between 
the container units we&#39;ve passed thus far. His strikes are faster than 
ever before, it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s improved over these past years as I am 
forced to remain on the defense. I don&#39;t know how much longer I can last 
by continuing to back up while defending, I&#39;ll eventually hit a wall or 
one of the units and leave myself open long enough to give a fatal blow. 
I have to take a risk if I am going to turn the tide of this battle.

I hop back after his next slash, but my jump lands my back against one 
of the containers, my body nearly falling over it upon impact. The 
Colonel takes note of this and raises his sword upward for a second, the 
weapon coming downward in the next. I lie on the container and await for 
the weapon, but I don&#39;t wait for my demise. When the blade is a mere 
centimeter away from my body, I quickly force all of my weight to the 
side, rolling away from the attack at the last second. My enemy has 
forced his weapon into the container unit, giving me a small opportunity 
to strike. I swing my blade at this moment during this moment of 
vulnerability, but I find myself staggering back as a sudden jolt of 
pain rushes into my left arm.

A dagger was hidden in the pommel of his sword, and that dagger was 
thrown the moment I went for a swing. Luckily the blade has not lodged 
into my arm, but it did graze it.

Ignoring the pain, I go for another swing, swinging upward from a 
diagonal fashion. My opponent manages to free his sword at this moment 
and quickly catches the swing with his own, guiding the blade in the 
opposite direction until the weapons&#39; motions create a full circle. At 
the end of the swing, we jump away once more, but this time I make sure 
not to back into a container.

&quot;Not bad, but you&#39;re still many leagues below me,&quot; Colonel Margulis 
brags without a hint of fatigue in his voice. &quot;It doesn&#39;t look like 
you&#39;ll last much longer at this rate. This next attack should put you 
out of your misery.&quot;

The Colonel releases his left hand from his sword at this moment, the 
blade now lifted above his head as his left palm faces me. His legs 
begin to part, his right leg bent back and his left stretched forward. I 
ready my stance too, but I choose a different one from the Colonel&#39;s. My 
hand whips the blade to the side now, the motion causing a sharp whoosh 
sound when I swing it. My left arm brings the sheath to the same level 
as my waist, the dull edge of the katana now traveling against the 
scabbard&#39;s side before the entire blade is placed inside its restraint. 
My legs mimic the actions of the Colonel&#39;s, but the positions of my 
hands are different. My left holds the sword and its sheath near my 
side, the sword held in a forty-five degree angle as my right had hover 
close to the hilt. I plan on using a draw technique; if I can draw my 
sword fast enough, I can end the battle in an instant, but the question 
is if I can draw my sword fast enough before the Colonel can strike. If 
I miss, I know I&#39;ll be left vulnerable, my body left wide open and my 
blade engraved into one of the containers. At least that&#39;s what I want 
him to think; I can strike him with my saya after the missed attack, it 
won&#39;t kill him, but it will stun him long enough to follow up with a 
sword slash.

Before I can wait any further, my opponent begins to move. He charges 
quickly, his feet barely meeting with the floor as they traverse. A 
second later, the Colonel&#39;s feet leave the floor altogether, his body 
now leaping into the air so that he may do a front flip. He plans to go 
for an air attack, but why would he do such a thing, it would only leave 
him more vulnerable to my draw? It&#39;s obviously a trick, but I decide to 
take the risk and see what he really plans to do. My arch-enemy has now 
turned his flip into a hammer swing, the blade perfectly aimed for the 
center of my skull. I begin to draw my blade at this point, twisting my 
body in the direction of my swing as I unsheathe my sword. Both swings 
are fast, but...

&quot;What!&quot; I halt the drawing of my blade.

If I had been watching their fight more closely, I would definitely have 
noticed it. The inconsistency with the Colonel&#39;s feet hitting the floor 
when running just a moment ago, and now his body&#39;s abrupt disappearance, 
I should have known that I was only fighting one of the Colonel&#39;s 
shadows! Back then, the Colonel was only able to create shadows that can 
only swing their sword once, but now he can create one that can fight an 
entire battle! It&#39;s obvious he&#39;s gotten stronger over the last fourteen 
years, but if I was only fighting a shadow, then where...?

&quot;As slow as ever, Uzuki.&quot;

Before I can turn around to see the face of my nemesis, a searing jolt 
erupts in my right shoulder. I turn to the source of the pain to find a 
sharpened slab of titanium lodged into it, the blade painted with 
streaks of crimson. The pain only returns a second after with the sword 
now extracted from my shoulder, my voice crying out in pain as ruby 
rivers escape the newly opened crater. I can&#39;t help but kneel as I 
clutch my wound, but my attention is not fully focused on the pain, but 
on those narrowed dark-purple pupils that pierce my very soul.

&quot;Bastard!&quot; I seethe.

&quot;You haven&#39;t changed one bit, Uzuki,&quot; the Colonel simpers, &quot;still unable 
to notice the details.&quot;

&quot;I should&#39;ve known you&#39;d do something as underhanded as this...&quot;

The sound of fighting from the upper floor grows louder than ever. I can 
hear tiny explosions beginning to echo from the floor above now and 
above those explosions, I can hear Miss Elly screams. It&#39;s obvious that 
she needs help, she can&#39;t keep protecting my sister on her own. I have 
to hurry up there, I have to...!

&quot;Thinking about trying to save your comrade and sister?&quot; my nemesis 
notices how I listen to the battle above. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. Your 
opponent is me, Uzuki. We have a score to settle. I won&#39;t allow you to 
go anywhere until then.&quot;

He&#39;s right, there&#39;s no way I can continue to run from this battle. I 
have to settle this here and now. He may have been the senior student in 
my grandfather&#39;s dojo, but my grandfather knew that he would only use 
his teachings to benefit himself, hence why he never taught the Colonel 
the final technique. I cannot allow him to tarnish my grandfather&#39;s 
teachings any longer, and I cannot allow him or any of his comrades to 
get a hold of Shion.

&quot;Very well,&quot; I ready my sword once again, &quot;let&#39;s settle this once and 
for all.&quot;

----------

(Ziggurat 8&#39;s POV)

This woman before me is rather persistent, continuing to get up even 
after my relentless assaults. It is true that she is indeed the 
test-type unit of the KOS-MOS Project, but according to my memory banks, 
she should no longer have the strength nor endurance of her previous 
self. However, it is quite clear that she still harbors the same 
guardianship she was originally programmed with as she shielded Shion 
Uzuki from each of my attacks.

&quot;Ziggy, why are you doing this?&quot; the mentioned KOS-MOS unit asks, using 
her sword as a crutch. &quot;What&#39;s gotten into you?&quot;

This is the third time she has addressed me with such a name, this 
&quot;Ziggy.&quot; She acts as if I am some sort of acquaintance by the way she 
speaks. It should also be noted that this entire time she has not tried 
to lay an attack on me either.

&quot;I do not know of this &#39;Ziggy&#39; you speak of,&quot; I tell the woman. &quot;I shall 
tell you once again, relinquish Shion Uzuki to me now, otherwise I will 
continue to resort to force until you either hand her to me or until you 
are no longer able to stand.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve gotten to you too, haven&#39;t they?&quot; she continues speaking. &quot;I 
should&#39;ve known, it&#39;s just like &#39;them&#39; to turn everyone around me 
against me. Even still, I have no intention of handing Shion to you, 
even if you were once an ally!&quot; she seethes.

&quot;Very well.&quot;

I begin to rush toward the KOS-MOS unit now, my target quickly pushing 
my objective out of the way so that she may attempt to stop my attack. 
She swings her sword at me at full force with both hands, but the attack 
misses as I step to the side. Her reaction to this is slow, so I take 
this moment to bring my knee to her abdomen. The attack forces her to 
hunch over, her body traveling upward with my knee. Even after I set my 
leg back down she still hunches over from the attack. I bring my fist 
onto her back as she stands there vulnerable, knocking her straight to 
the floor. With the target incapacitated, I walk toward my objective 
once more, who continues to lie on the floor uttering the words &quot;I&#39;m 
only a copy&quot; over and over again.

Before I can come within arm&#39;s reach however, I turn around to find the 
KOS-MOS unit charging once again. She swings her blade in a hammer-like 
fashion at the end of her rush, the jack blade on my left arm rising in 
an attempt to catch it. I appear to have miscalculated however, as my 
target&#39;s sword manages to slice through the material of my weapon with 
ease. Immediately she tries to follow with another attack, but her blade 
suddenly stops before it can come in contact with me. Her entire form 
seems to be shaking now, the weapon in her hands barely held in place. 
It is unknown why she has suddenly stopped, but I must take advantage of 
this situation.

My right fist meets with her chin this time; the force behind this 
attack is strong enough to push her back and free the weapon in her 
hand. Again she falls, but this time her face is pointed toward the 
ceiling of the facility. It is obvious that I cannot just leave her 
lying like this, at any given moment she may return to her feet and 
attempt to attack me once more. I walk over to her now, finding her 
nearly unconscious. I begin to pull her up at this moment, taking her by 
the collar of her dress. My right hand begins to pull back, preparing 
the final punch that will render her dead. The blow never comes however 
as my sensors detect two more life forms entering the vicinity.

The doors that allow entrance to the area begin to open now, with the 
mentioned life forms running through. I immediately recognize the female 
among the two, my memory identifies her as the Testament of Sameness. 
The silver-haired boy that accompanies her cannot be identified however, 
so I must take precautions if I have to deal with him.

&quot;Ziggy?&quot; the unidentified boy begins to address me by that title now. 
&quot;What are you doing!&quot; he asks as he hurries over to me.

It is clear that he is after the KOS-MOS unit I am trying to dispose of, 
but I try to swat him away before he can come close. The boy manages to 
dodge my swing, his face showing a puzzled look after.

&quot;What have you done to Elly, Ziggy!&quot; he begins to question my actions. 
&quot;After you all escaped, I thought that something terrible had happened 
to all of you, but now I find you...!&quot;

The sound of Chief Inquisitor Margulis&#39;s battle on the floor below 
interrupts the boy&#39;s speech before he can say another word. His confused 
look now shifts into an angry one at this point, his entire body now 
giving off faint readings of Ether. The readings gradually increase in 
the manner of milliseconds, and after only three seconds, his readings 
are off the chart. The readings quickly die however as more life forms 
appear on my sensors. This time I read four of them, and as such, four 
more individuals enter.

These ones that have now entered are a different variety: one male 
human, one male U.R.T.V., and two Realians, one male and one female. 
Three of these four are registered in my data banks however; the 
U.R.T.V. is labeled as U.R.T.V. #666, Rubedo, the leader of the U.R.T.V. 
Forces. The male Realian is a Vector Military-type, programmed with the 
&#39;Canaan&#39; factor. The other Realian is also identified, she is the 
100-Series Observational Realian Prototype known as MOMO.

I find my entire body suddenly freezing the moment I recognize her face. 
For a second, I believe I saw her face smiling at me, but the scenery 
around us was different. The feel of her arms wrapping around my waist 
was also apparent, and there was some sort of music in the background. 
What I had just seen must have been a small malfunction, it shouldn&#39;t be 
of any concern at the moment.

&quot;What the hell!&quot; the U.R.T.V. reacts upon seeing me.

&quot;Ziggy, what are you doing!&quot; the 100-Series gasps.

&quot;Machines are rather simple to understand once you get basic gist of 
them,&quot; the Testament begins to smirk now. &quot;They&#39;ll do anything you tell 
them to; of course it might take a while to program them to do it with 
all those firewalls, protection codes, and other technological 
mumbo-jumbo.&quot;

&quot;I should have known you would have done something as under-handed as 
this if we let you go ahead of us!&quot; the U.R.T.V. spits, pointing one his 
firearms at the Testament.

&quot;I had nothing to do with this one actually,&quot; she admits, remaining calm 
as the gun remains pointed at her face. &quot;Besides, you ought to know now 
that your weapons are useless against me.&quot;

The barrel of the U.R.T.V. leader&#39;s gun begins to pull back at this 
moment, the bullet inside suddenly launched out as a whole. The 
projectile explodes into a cloud of smoke shortly after, giving the 
Testament a moment to jump away and onto one of the beams stretched 
across the ceiling.

&quot;Ziggurat 8, take care of them,&quot; the Testament orders me. &quot;Kill them 
all.&quot;

&quot;Roger.&quot;

&quot;Old man, are you serious?&quot; the U.R.T.V. leader asks me now.

&quot;Stop it, Ziggy!&quot; the young realian begins to order me now.

Another image of her flashes through my mind once more. This time the 
U.R.T.V. leader is in it as well.

&quot;Is your paycheck the only thing you care about!&quot; the red-haired boy 
yells at me. &quot;You just wanna dump her off so you can get to your next 
job, is that it, you&#39;re just gonna leave her like that!&quot;

&quot;Though I dislike your way of words, that describes the situation rather 
well,&quot; I find myself answering.

&quot;You son of a...!&quot; the young boy begins to throw a punch.

&quot;Jr.! Ziggy! Stop it!&quot; the young realian screams. &quot;Jr., please calm 
down, Ziggy&#39;s only doing his job, and...&quot;

&quot;Only doing his job, how can you say that, MOMO!&quot; the U.R.T.V. turns his 
anger to the young realian now. &quot;Don&#39;t you see what&#39;s going on here, he 
doesn&#39;t care about how you&#39;re feeling right now, he just wants to drop 
you off like that and be on his way! I know that&#39;s not what you want, 
MOMO, so...&quot;

&quot;Ziggy&#39;s already done more than enough letting me stay with at the Uzuki 
Residence for the past few days,&quot; the 100-Series interrupts him, &quot;he&#39;s 
already gone more than out of his way to allow me to do so. Ziggy&#39;s job 
was only to escort me to the UMN Committee&#39;s Central HQ, that&#39;s all, he 
didn&#39;t have to do anything else.&quot;

Another malfunction? This is starting to become a problem. I must not 
let such a thing stop me again. If I were to make a single error, it may 
jeopardize my mission.

&quot;Everyone, Ziggy&#39;s... not his usual self,&quot; the KOS-MOS unit in my grasp 
barely speaks. &quot;They must have...reprogrammed him when we got separated. 
He&#39;s after Shion, you have to stop him. Jin&#39;s... also in trouble, he&#39;s 
fighting on the floor below us. Please, help them...&quot;

The KOS-MOS unit says nothing more after that. It&#39;s clear that she has 
only fallen unconscious as her chest slowly heaves after her eyes shut. 
Her wounds are not serious, but if she exerts herself anymore, the 
wounds will worsen. I will have to finish her off later to ensure her 
death; at the moment however, I must complete the orders the Testament 
of Sameness has just given me.

&quot;Everyone, I&#39;ll go help Jin,&quot; the silver-haired boy informs his 
comrades. &quot;Allen, Canaan, keep Shion safe, and when you get the chance, 
take Elly out to the sidelines of the fighting as well. Jr., MOMO, I&#39;m 
going to leave you with Ziggy.&quot;

&quot;But...!&quot; the young realian tries to protest.

&quot;You&#39;ll find a way, I know you will.&quot;

The boy tries to run past me at this moment and I naturally try to stop 
him. I cannot chase him for long however, as a bullet is fired before my 
foot. It is clear that the U.R.T.V. has no intention of allowing me to 
stop their comrade, so I must take care of him and the 100-Series first. 
My objective of stopping the boy should be completed regardless as 
Commander Margulis of the U-TIC Organization is fighting their other 
ally on the floor below.

Without wasting anymore time, I hurry toward the enemy that had just 
fired. Oddly enough, the U.R.T.V. does not fire again as I dash toward 
him, instead his hand shakes relentlessly as he continues to point his 
firearm at me. When the two young ones are within my reach, I begin to 
launch my fist forward. The U.R.T.V. and the Realian jump away in 
separate directions after my attempted strike, but again neither makes 
an attempt to counterattack. Another shot of gunfire follows from behind 
me, being fired from the military Realian that is assisting the Vector 
employee.

&quot;What&#39;re you doing, stop it!&quot; the U.R.T.V. suddenly yells at the 
realian.

&quot;You heard the KOS-MOS unit, the cyborg has been reprogrammed, and thus, 
is to be viewed as an enemy,&quot; the Realian explains. &quot;He must be 
destroyed.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not right, he can&#39;t help it!&quot; the 100-Series tries to defend me 
now. &quot;Ziggy is...!&quot;

I charge at the 100-Series now while she tries to speak, knocking the 
U.R.T.V. away in the process. As soon as the pink-haired girl realizes 
my attack, the military Realian begins to fire again. I manage to dodge 
this shot, stepping forward at the same time my right hand grabs the 
100-Series by the collar. I turn the child in the direction of the 
firing enemy now, preventing any further shots to be fired. 
Surprisingly, the girl doesn&#39;t attempt to struggle as she remains in my 
grasp, instead she looks at me with a sorrowful and worried look on her 
face.

&quot;Ziggy, please, don&#39;t do this...,&quot; she begs.

&quot;MOMO!&quot; the U.R.T.V. yells as he recovers from my attack.

&quot;Ziggy, have you really forgotten everything?&quot; the child asks me. &quot;You 
couldn&#39;t have forgotten everything. You said it was your mission to 
protect me, remember?&quot;

Another image flashes through my eyes now, the 100-Series Realian once 
again found within. I find myself approaching her as she stands on the 
other side of what appears to be a jail cell. She begins to look at me 
with a puzzled expression with a hint of fear.

&quot;Who... are you?&quot; she barely manages to ask.

&quot;The Contact Subcommittee sent me here to rescue you,&quot; I find myself 
answering.

The images disappear from my sight once again, just as quickly as they 
had come in, replaced by another scene. I appear to be hiding with the 
girl, the two of us ducking underneath the window of what appears to be 
a control room.

&quot;Um...,&quot; the child begins to speak. &quot;Are you a military Realian?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; I answer, &quot;an ex-human.&quot;

&quot;Ex-human?&quot;

&quot;A cyborg,&quot; I explain. &quot;An ancient relic. I registered as an organ donor 
without giving it much thought, and they resurrected me after my death.&quot;

&quot;That infamous Life Recycling Act, right?&quot; she questions.

&quot;Yeah. The Species Preservation Act came about thanks to the mess that 
old law caused.&quot;

&quot;Um...you still haven&#39;t... ...told me your name,&quot; the young Realian 
brings up once again.

&quot;It&#39;s Ziggurat,&quot; I answer, &quot;8.&quot;

&quot;Ziggurat...8?&quot; the girl gives me another puzzled look. &quot;You&#39;re a real 
human, but your name sounds more like a model number. I know!&quot; her face 
suddenly beams into a smile. &quot;How about I call you Ziggy instead? 
Z-I-G-G-Y. It&#39;s short for Ziggurat...&quot;

&quot;MO...MO...?&quot; I begin to address the girl I&#39;m holding before me now.

What is this I&#39;m seeing? A malfunction? No, memories, these are memories 
from not too long ago, so why...?

&quot;What are you doing, Ziggurat 8!&quot; the Testament yells at me from the 
beam on the ceiling. &quot;Finish them, you have a mission to accomplish.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; I find my fist beginning to loosen now.

&quot;You recognize me now, don&#39;t you, Ziggy?&quot; the young girl asks. &quot;I know I 
just started out as another mission objective to you, but I know that&#39;s 
not how it is anymore. Remember when you danced with me during my 
birthday?&quot;

&quot;Come on, Ziggy,&quot; the scenery around me disappears once again, the young 
child now tugging at my arm, &quot;dance with me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I apologize, &quot;but I&#39;m not much of a dancer.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; the Realian continues to tug, &quot;please!&quot;

&quot;Go for it, cyborg,&quot; I turn around to find the U.R.T.V. leader 
encouraging me, &quot;but I got the next dance, okay?&quot;

&quot;...all right,&quot; I give in after a moment of ridding myself of my 
insecurity, &quot;but I&#39;m not very good at it.&quot;

&quot;Yay!&quot; MOMO cheers as she leads me to the dance floor.

&quot;...that&#39;s right,&quot; I finish recalling, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Does your mission mean nothing to you, Ziggurat 8!&quot; the Testament yells 
again. &quot;Finish...!&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; the U.R.T.V. leader begins firing at the Testament.

&quot;I can&#39;t do it...&quot; I begin to lower MOMO to the ground now, &quot;because...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the closest thing I have to a parent, Ziggy,&quot; I remember.

&quot;...because I love MOMO as if she were my own daughter,&quot; I finish in the 
present.

Yes, that&#39;s right, I can never bring myself to harm her. The only reason 
for why I no longer wish to forget the past is because of her. She is 
the light I have found in the darkness of my life after a century; there 
is no way I can extinguish it with my own hands, much less let anyone 
else do it. Voyager, how could I allow myself to be manipulated by him 
agai...!

My sensors suddenly pick up a strong reading of Ether. It&#39;s coming from 
above us; MOMO is directly in the path of the blast I&#39;m reading! Without 
even thinking, I quickly push her out of the blast&#39;s path, but the 
moment I do, I find the mentioned Ether now raining down upon me in an 
instant. My mechanical arm and left leg have melted within the blink of 
an eye, my entire body quickly falling to the floor after the blast 
disappears.

&quot;Ziggy!&quot; MOMO screams.

I turn myself over to face the ceiling, finding a giant hole that 
stretches through the floors above us. A giant object also appears in 
this hole, the object growing larger with every second. The device seems 
to be giving off some sort of fuel residue, I can only conclude that 
it&#39;s some sort of A.M.W.S. unit. This machine is not like anything I&#39;ve 
seen before; it&#39;s gold in color, with wing-like devices protruding from 
its head and back. The frame itself is rather bulky, almost like the 
machine Albedo pilots, but somewhat smoother. The head itself only has a 
single red orb on its face, almost like an eye. Two figures stand on the 
shoulders of the machine. The first one I recognize immediately; it is 
the KOS-MOS Archetype unit. The other one is an elderly man who wears 
some sort of cap and long white robe. I zoom in on the face of the old 
individual, seeing his neatly-groomed white mustache and pale skin. This 
man who is he, and what is he doing here?

&quot;Took you long enough to get here, Your Holiness,&quot; Citrine greets the 
man.

----------

(Shion&#39;s POV)

I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m 
only a...

&quot;Shion...,&quot; I faintly hear someone calling my name. &quot;Shion...&quot;

No, it&#39;s not a name, it&#39;s a label. I&#39;m only a copy of my mother, no, my 
original self, a duplicate of her genes. The me that&#39;s here isn&#39;t really 
me, it never was. I was created to replace someone, to take over a duty.

&quot;Shion...,&quot; I look ahead to find the one who is speaking lying on the 
floor, barely conscious. &quot;Set them free...,&quot; Elly barely speaks. &quot;Please 
set...&quot;

&quot;...my sisters free,&quot; the apparition of my mother&#39;s nurse suddenly 
appears before her.

&quot;Set them free..., was that what my original self was supposed to do?&quot; I 
ask. &quot;Is that the purpose for why I was born?&quot;

&quot;Please, set them free, Shion,&quot; Febronia requests once again. &quot;I&#39;m 
asking you as individual, and not a copy, to set them free.&quot;

&quot;But why me!&quot; I continue to yell. &quot;Why must I set them free? Is this 
what everyone is expecting of me! I don&#39;t want to do it, I can&#39;t do it! 
I&#39;m sick of everyone telling me what I should do!&quot;

At that very moment, Jin and chaos appear, jumping from the floor below 
to the current floor. The two of them are injured, but they ignore their 
wounds for the most part, instead turning their attention upward. I find 
my eyes beginning to follow theirs now, finding a large, gold-colored 
machine hovering above us, along with Miang and another man standing on 
its shoulders.

&quot;Ah, his Holiness has finally arrived,&quot; I turn back to where Jin and 
chaos stand, finding a man I had never seen before smiling at the giant 
robot.

&quot;It&#39;s here,&quot; the old man turns toward the Zohar, &quot;finally, after 
fourteen years, we can begin to fulfill the Old Prophecy.&quot;

&quot;We can accomplish it sooner than expected, your Holiness,&quot; Miang 
informs the man, &quot;the &#39;Mother of Destiny&#39; is here as well.&quot;

&#39;Mother of Destiny,&#39; I find myself becoming more frustrated now that 
I&#39;ve heard that title. The reason for why I exist was to be this 
so-called Mother, a role I never wanted bestowed up on me.

&quot;Hello Mother,&quot; Miang begins to address me now. &quot;I&#39;m sorry for having to 
meet you each time under the worst circumstances, and I&#39;m sorry for 
keeping Elly away from you for a while.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; I find myself taking my anger out on her now. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare 
call me &#39;Mother!&#39; You&#39;re no child of mine!&quot;

&quot;Mother...?&quot;

&quot;I told you not to call me that! &#39;Mother of Destiny,&#39; is that what all 
of you just see me as, huh! Some sick prophecy you wish for me to 
fulfill? How can you all choose me to do something I had no say in!&quot;

&quot;Please Mother, I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;

&quot;I told you to shut up!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s obvious that the woman has no intention of coming with us 
peacefully,&quot; the elder man begins to speak now. &quot;Margulis, restrain 
her.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; the unknown man nods.

&quot;Get away from my sister!&quot; Jin orders as the man brushes past him.

Jin tries to raises his sword once again in an attempt to stop him, but 
a loud bang suddenly echoes within the vicinity, the bullet meeting with 
the ground a centimeter away from Jin&#39;s foot. I look to the source of 
the noise to return my gaze to Citrine who stands on a beam in the 
ceiling, the gun in her hand still smoking from the shot.

&quot;Don&#39;t touch her!&quot; chaos tries to stop the man now.

The gold mecha begins to turn at this moment, facing the direction of 
chaos and my brother. A beam of light emits from one of the fingers of 
the machine, the light suddenly traveling across the space between chaos 
and the one called Margulis. The beam quickly cuts into the metal floor, 
slicing it clean off from the rest of the area. The newly created 
platform begins to fall to the level below, but Jin and chaos attempt to 
jump off before they can follow.

While they are still in the air however, Miang suddenly jumps off from 
the shoulder of the unknown machine in the direction of the two. A sword 
materializes in her right hand at this point, the blade pointed toward 
the ground in an angle and the hilt of the weapon facing up. Jin tries 
to meet with her incoming attack with his own sword, but by the time 
their blades meet, Miang forces Jin away, instantaneously knocking him 
to the edge of my location in the same swing. chaos attempts an attack 
at this point with his own fist, but Miang easily sees through this and 
catches his attack in the palm of her hand. She copies the same action 
she did with Jin, throwing him on top of my brother. Instead of falling 
to the level below, her feet manage to find their way onto the Zohar, 
forcing her body into it so that she may rebound off it and jump in 
front of her two opponents.

&quot;I can&#39;t allow you to interfere,&quot; she tells the two.

Jin and chaos return to their feet at this moment and begin to attack 
again, but my attention quickly turns back to Margulis who continues to 
approach me. Jr. and Canaan step forward this time, the two of them 
drawing their guns and opening fire. None of their rounds strike their 
target however, as they are easily deflected by our enemy&#39;s blade. As I 
watch, I suddenly find myself being pulled to my feet, with one arm on 
my shoulder and another around my waist.

&quot;Come on, Chief, let&#39;s get out of here!&quot; Allen tells me.

My co-worker tries to make me walk with him, my feet dragging against 
the floor with every step. He pulls me to where Ziggy, MOMO, and Elly 
are resting, with MOMO trying to do her best to tend to their wounds.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about me, MOMO,&quot; the cyborg says as he tries to drag 
himself back up to the remains of his mechanical legs, &quot;I can still...&quot;

&quot;Stop it, Ziggy!&quot; MOMO cries. &quot;You&#39;re in no condition to fight. Because 
of me, your arm and legs...!&quot;

&quot;Why...?&quot; I begin to ask everyone. &quot;Why are you all doing this?&quot;

&quot;Chief?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not really me, I&#39;m only a copy,&quot; I explain, &quot;so why, why are you 
all risking your lives for me!&quot; I yell. &quot;Is it because you all wish 
something of me too? Am I really that important that you&#39;d kill each 
other!&quot;

&quot;The &#39;Mother of Destiny&#39; is a vital factor in the completion of our 
prophecy,&quot; the old man dictates from his machine, &quot;so of course we are 
willing to take as many lives as need be to obtain you. Yes, we&#39;ll take 
the lives of everyone that&#39;s unnecessary to achieve our goal.&quot;

&quot;Is that so? Then...&quot; I equip my M.W.S. one last time.

&quot;Chief, what are you...?&quot;

I find myself beginning to walk now, walking toward the recently cut 
edge of this floor. No one is able to stop me fortunately, everyone is 
too busy fighting amongst each other. Yes, even MOMO and Allen have 
gotten themselves caught in fighting as Citrine opened fire on them when 
they tried to follow. I begin to charge my weapon at this point, the 
invention beginning to hum softly as it collects the energy. The humming 
gradually grows louder with every passing second, the M.W.S. even begins 
to shake against my arm.

&quot;Warning, continued charging of the unit will result in 
self-destruction,&quot; the system of my weapon speaks. &quot;If that is what you 
request, remove the unit and move to a safer area within a minute&#39;s 
time.&quot;

A minute&#39;s time, that&#39;s all I have left before I can end this sad 
existence. The shaking and noise becomes even more erratic as I continue 
to stand in this spot, my eyes drifting toward the energy containers 
that sit below. Thirty more seconds the M.W.S. reads, it will be over 
soon. I continue to scan through each of the mechanical ovals as I await 
the inevitable, my eyes slowly reading the tiny letters engraved on each 
one. They stop drifting however, as my eyes barely scan two words on two 
separate containers.

&quot;Cecilia...?&quot; I read from them. &quot;Catherine!&quot;

Feb&#39;s sisters! What are they doing there? Why have they been mutilated 
and...!

&quot;Shion...&quot; I turn around to see the apparition of my mother&#39;s nurse once 
more. &quot;Please, set my sisters free...&quot;

&quot;Feb...&quot;

Why, why Cecily and Cathe? They did nothing wrong, they were just 
ordinary children, they did nothing to deserve this! Was it because they 
were involved with me when I was still a child? And these other Realians 
that are inside those devices like them, what did they do to deserve 
this? For the future of the Realians, is this what Feb meant? Is this 
what all Realians were built for, to act as some component for this 
relic!

No more. I can&#39;t take it anymore. Everyone... everyone is suffering 
because of me. And because of that, I... I&#39;m sorry, Feb, but I can&#39;t set 
them free, but I can...

&quot;Shion!&quot;

The inevitable does not come however as I find myself suddenly pushed to 
the floor and the M.W.S. quickly peeled off my arm. As I fall to the 
ground, I watch the red device fall to the lower level, the entire unit 
releasing a rain of energy as it transforms into a gigantic explosion. 
The beams begin to shower over the oval devices below, each beam causing 
several to engulf in flames upon impact. The initial fires spread 
quickly, immediately hopping to the ones next to them in seconds until 
the entire collection is set ablaze. Finally, I had set them free, but 
not in the way I wanted. I... I just... I just killed hundreds, if not 
thousands, of innocent people who had nothing to do with this conflict. 
If I had set off the M.W.S. like I had originally planned, I would have 
killed everyone on this floor alone, saving them to be rescued later on 
by someone else, but then... That death was for me and everyone who 
wished to manipulate me, so why? Is my life really that of great 
importance that innocents must die so that I may live!

&quot;Why...?&quot; the words of the one who saved me begin to ask in a harsh 
tone. &quot;What were you thinking, you idiot!&quot;

&quot;Elly...?&quot; I look up to find her standing over me, her fingers wrapped 
into fists.

&quot;After all we&#39;ve done for you, you&#39;re just going to throw it all away!&quot;

&quot;My life was never mine to begin with,&quot; I explain. &quot;I&#39;m only a...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t start with that &#39;I&#39;m only a copy&#39; bullshit! You&#39;re not a copy, 
you&#39;re yourself, Shion. Yes you&#39;ve inherited your mother&#39;s genes, but 
that doesn&#39;t mean... Are you listening to me, Shion? Shion? Shion!&quot;

Her words gradually become silent in my ears, my voice doing it&#39;s best 
to shut all noise that surrounds me.

&quot;I&#39;m only a copy,&quot; I begin to say once again. &quot;I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only 
a copy. I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only a copy.&quot;

I&#39;m only a copy. A horrible copy, a copy that just murdered many 
innocent people...

----------

(Elly&#39;s POV)

The entire vicinity begins to break into a tremor; everyone else begins 
to stop fighting as it worsens in a manner of seconds.

&quot;What&#39;s going on!&quot; I turn back to MOMO as she desperately tries to keep 
her balance by hugging the nearest wall.

&quot;Foolish woman,&quot; the Patriarch begins to speak. &quot;I can&#39;t believe she 
destroyed the Zohar&#39;s entire restraint system.&quot;

Restraint system? What is he talking about? Of course, my old data banks 
spoke of something like this. During the failed project in Michtam 
twenty-four years ago, Realians were used to keep the Zohar&#39;s power in 
check; their bodies would be hooked up to the Zohar and the Zohar&#39;s 
energy would then flow into their bodies, taking the place of their 
bodily functions as if they were in some sort of womb. Of course a 
single Realian was far from sufficient to do the job, it required nearly 
one-thousand Realians to do this. Often times younger Realians were 
chosen to do the job because they were not as fully grown and aged as 
their older counterparts, thus it would take longer for them to replaced 
with a newer, younger one to take their place if they were to pass away.

&quot;Your sister&#39;s just as stubborn just as you are, Uzuki,&quot; Margulis tells 
Jin.

&quot;Why you...!&quot;

After hearing those words, Jin quickly rises back to his feet, running 
past my sister so that he may swing his sword at his rival, but this 
time, the Chief Inquisitor does not fight back, instead taking a leap 
into the air, his feet landing on the shoulders of the gold mecha that 
hovers above his. As soon as he lands, the machine begins to point its 
palm at us; the center of its hand beginning to open as a Vulcan gun 
emerges from within. The weapon begins firing immediately, causing Jin, 
Jr., MOMO, Canaan, and Allen to scatter.

&quot;Your Holiness, what do you want us to do with the girl?&quot; Citrine asks 
above the noise of the elder man&#39;s attack.

&quot;Leave her,&quot; the Patriarch answers, &quot;we&#39;ll just take what we came here 
for and be on our way.&quot;

&quot;Hey, where are you going!&quot; Jr. yells as the machine begins to turn away 
from them now.

The young director begins to aim his pistols at the machine now, but 
each of the bullets ricochets off its armor at the moment of impact. 
MOMO tries to use her bow after seeing Jr.&#39;s failed attempts, but her 
attacks only leave black marks on its gold-colored surface. Even 
Canaan&#39;s attempts that follow have no effect, despite his rifle being 
loaded with anti-A.M.W.S. rounds. The machine is heading toward our 
direction; they may not be after Shion at the moment, but I can&#39;t let 
them take the Zohar.

I draw my sword once again the moment the towering invention&#39;s shadow 
meets with my own. Soon I find myself beginning to running toward my 
enemies with all my might, my sword slicing into the metallic ground. 
Blood begins to flow freely from my arms and legs, the injuries that 
Ziggy had given me a short while ago taking their toll on my body once 
more. I do my best to ignore the pain, the crimson rivers now dripping 
into my foot steps and sword. Finally I find myself in jumping distance 
of the machine, but I find my legs beginning to die on me. I ignore the 
sudden numbness, but I don&#39;t know if I can reach the altitude of my 
enemies. My legs push into the ground with their remaining strength 
causing even more blood to escape my wounds. Miraculously I find myself 
leaping into the air, my body quickly brushing past the mecha&#39;s legs, 
arms, and now torso. At the rate I&#39;m going, Margulis and the Patriarch 
should be within blade&#39;s reach at any...

&quot;I can&#39;t allow you to interfere, my darling,&quot; I suddenly find my 
sister&#39;s face in front of my own.

Her right arm immediately begins to swing inward, the hilt of her weapon 
taking the lead. I bring my own blade in front of me in an attempt to 
block the swing; even though my sword does catch her own, the sheer 
power of her attack is enough to knock me backward. I find the wind 
hastily cutting against my back after the impact of her weapons, my 
spine meeting with a hard, metallic surface in the next second. I find 
my legs unable to move after hitting the floor, my arms barely able to 
push me upward and the grasp of my weapon loosened. As I attempt to 
recover, Miang lands in front of me, her weapon no longer raised against 
me but resting near her side.

&quot;That was impressive, Elly,&quot; Miang compliments me, &quot;I didn&#39;t think you 
were capable of having an instantaneous spike in your Ether, allowing 
you to jump to that altitude.&quot;

&quot;You really did mean it when you said &#39;the next time we meet, we&#39;ll be 
enemies,&#39;&quot; I remember. &quot;I didn&#39;t think it would be this soon that we 
meet again.&quot;

&quot;Miss Elly!&quot; I find Jin and my comrades that are able to stand rushing 
toward me.

&quot;It looks like we&#39;re done here,&quot; Miang suddenly speaks, not even turning 
her attention to the ones running toward her. &quot;Proto-Omega is now 
finally complete.&quot;

I turn back to find the gold-colored machine reaching toward the Zohar 
with both of its arms. Both hands take hold of separate rings that 
levitate around the artifact, quickly prying them away, causing the 
Zohar to fall to the floor below. The mecha doesn&#39;t allow it to fall far 
however, as it catches the relic with one of its hands. The chest area 
of the robot opens at this point, revealing a giant imprint that is in 
the shape of a giant cross. In seconds, the Zohar fills that space 
perfectly, the chest component of the machine closing once again after.

&quot;I guess that&#39;s mission complete, ladies and gentlemen,&quot; the black 
testament suddenly appears on the towering mecha&#39;s head.

&quot;Voyager!&quot; Ziggy yells at the man.

&quot;Thank you for your support, Jan,&quot; the cloaked man smirks, &quot;without you, 
this mission would have been a failure.&quot;

&quot;Bastard!&quot;

The tremors begin to worsen at this point, growing even more 
uncontrollable before. The shaking causes everyone to fall to the floor 
at this point, it&#39;s impossible for anyone except for Miang to stand up.

&quot;I suggest that you and your friends escape, my love,&quot; Miang advises me. 
&quot;I really am sorry about all of this, Elly.&quot;

&quot;Miang...!&quot; I glare once more.

Without saying another word, my sister and Citrine hop onto the 
shoulders of Proto-Omega. Our enemies begin to fly away at this point, 
the earthquake only worsening by the second. Debris even begins to fall 
from the floors above us now, and at the rate this is going, is won&#39;t 
even be ten minutes before this whole floor is buried!

Hope is not lost however, the latest piece of debris is something I 
quickly recognize. It&#39;s gotten a few dents from falling, but it doesn&#39;t 
look like it will affect its flying capabilities.

&quot;What&#39;s that doing here?&quot; Canaan asks upon seeing the machine.

&quot;When I came here, the E.S. Dinah landed on the top floor of this 
building,&quot; I answer. &quot;I&#39;ll be able to fit two other people aside from 
myself in the cockpit, I&#39;m afraid everyone else will have to hold onto 
part of the exterior while we escape.&quot;

I force my sword into the ground at this moment so that I may use it as 
a crutch. I hurry over to Shion who still remains lying in the same 
spot, muttering the same words of &quot;I&#39;m only a copy&quot; again and again. I 
try to deafen my ears to her words, ignoring them as I wrap her arm 
around my shoulder so that I may drag the two of us to my craft. The 
others manage to open the cockpit for me, but I find the strength in my 
legs beginning to die on me again. More debris from the floors above 
falls, each piece of concrete or pipe comes closer and closer to hitting 
us. Somehow I manage to drag the two of us to the A.M.W.S., placing 
Shion in one of the cockpit seats.

&quot;MOMO, I think we can fit you and Ziggy onto a single seat,&quot; I tell her 
as I see his current condition. &quot;Everyone, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to 
ride in the hands. I&#39;ll hold each of you close to the chest area to 
minimize the chances of being struck by any debris.&quot;

&quot;Elly, are you all right?&quot; Jr. asks as I practically drag myself so that 
I may place Shion on one of the seats. &quot;You&#39;re bleeding.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; I try to assure the boy.

&quot;Here, let me administer a Medica Ether,&quot; MOMO offers, &quot;you&#39;re not in 
any condition to...&quot;

&quot;I said I&#39;ll be fine!&quot; I practically yell. &quot;We have to get everyone out 
of here, and now!&quot;

I drag myself into the pilot seat of the machine at this moment just as 
MOMO takes the third seat and places Ziggy on her lap. With the three of 
us now inside, I immediately start to activate the controls.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, if it wasn&#39;t for me,&quot; the cyborg apologizes I start up the 
machine.

&quot;You couldn&#39;t help it,&quot; I tell him, trying to ignore the pain of my 
wounds.

Luckily the craft starts up without any problems or delays, allowing me 
to take the others into the mecha&#39;s hands as promised. With everyone now 
on board, I activate the rockets on the E.S. Dinah so that we may 
escape. Immediately after leaving the floor we were on, we are greeted 
by several giant pieces of concrete that fall from the upper levels. The 
moment my fingers tighten on the controls, more pain shoots up my arms. 
I clench my teeth in an attempt to block out the sensation, but it only 
causes more crimson rivers to escape the craters. Somehow I ignore the 
pain, allowing myself to pilot the craft so that I can dodge the falling 
pieces of the building without having to change the course of the Dinah. 
Even though we managed to escape from the immediate danger, we are 
immediately greeted by more rubble the moment we pass through. Four 
pieces in each direction, I don&#39;t know if we can escape this one, but... 
No, there&#39;s a small space which we can fit through, if we can just...

I feel myself beginning to grow faint again as we fly toward this new 
hazard, even my vision begins to grow blurry. I shake my head in an 
attempt to regain my composure, but it doesn&#39;t do much good. I can&#39;t 
seem to focus, everything looks exactly the same now. No, there&#39;s 
something that stands out. The light, it&#39;s the sunlight, I can see it 
through the small crack of the falling construction. I have to focus on 
it, and then...

We manage to pass through, the sunlight on the other side growing 
brighter. More pieces of debris fall, but we&#39;re so close to the exit 
that simply flying against it won&#39;t slow us down. I ram through each of 
the pieces of concrete and the iron beams, keeping mind to hold the ones 
on the exterior of the craft close to avoid and injuries. Before we know 
it, we are outside, but I feel as if we&#39;re still not out of danger yet.

&quot;Something&#39;s not right,&quot; Ziggy informs me as we continue to fly into the 
atmosphere. &quot;It&#39;s faint, but doesn&#39;t it feel like this entire area is 
shaking?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m detecting tremors coming from the crust of this area,&quot; MOMO reports 
as she reads the screen displayed in front of her. &quot;It&#39;s not the 
building that&#39;s causing this, it&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;The whole planet is shaking!&quot; I realize. &quot;Without the Zohar, all of 
Miltia is going to split apart!&quot;

&quot;Is that even possible!&quot; Ziggy exclaims.

&quot;U-DO must have not only linked with Labyrinthos over the past fourteen 
years, it must have also merged with the planet&#39;s core during that time 
as well,&quot; I explain. &quot;In other words, U-DO, which is part of the Zohar, 
is part of the core of Miltia, and with the Zohar taken away, part of 
the core must have also been taken away, so much that the planet can&#39;t 
contain itself.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;re we going to do!&quot; MOMO asks frantically.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I can fly the Dinah into space in time before the planet 
collapses, but even if I were, the others would...!&quot;

&quot;Hey, is that you in there, Miss Vector?&quot; a familiar voice suddenly 
enters my radio.

&quot;Matthews!&quot;

I activate the rear camera on my craft to see a welcomed sight. It&#39;s the 
Elsa, and she&#39;s flying in our direction.

&quot;We&#39;re gonna open up the hatch, get in there as soon as you can,&quot; 
Matthews orders on the other line.

I quickly turn the Dinah around at that moment to see the hatch in the 
Elsa beginning to open. I feel my consciousness dwindling again, the 
control panel and joystick are painted with random spots of crimson. I&#39;m 
losing a lot of blood; I hate to admit it, but I&#39;m not sure how much 
longer I can stay awake.

&quot;I&#39;m only a copy,&quot; my ears turn back to the attention of my lover. &quot;I&#39;m 
only a copy. I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only a copy. I&#39;m only a...&quot;

I can&#39;t fail now, I still have to prove to her that she isn&#39;t a copy, I 
have to at least get her and the others to safety. No, not only that, I 
have to stop my former superiors, I can&#39;t let them complete their 
objective, and I can&#39;t have them manipulate my sister any longer. And 
Abel, I promised Abel I would return, I promised myself that I would 
find out what it is about him that makes me see my own immaturity.

&quot;Everyone, it might get a bit rough,&quot; I announce to everyone on the 
exterior with my radio. &quot;Just hold on tight.&quot;

Everything begins to merge into black at this moment, but the last thing 
I see is the lights inside the hangar. Remembering where I last saw 
them, I begin to force my foot into the craft&#39;s acceleration with my 
remaining strength. I can no longer see where we are going, and I can 
barely even hear the others&#39; screams. Are we heading in the right 
direction? I don&#39;t know, but we have to...

I feel the entire craft coming to a sudden stop now, my body nearly 
breaking out of the seatbelt before it bounces back against the seat. It 
may have not been the best landing, but we&#39;ve made it.

&quot;We made it!&quot; I barely hear MOMO&#39;s cheerful voice.

&quot;Yes, we&#39;ve made it,&quot; I barely speak. &quot;We&#39;ve made it... Feeling... 
rather light-headed now. Must rest...&quot;

&quot;Elly, are you okay?&quot; I can hear MOMO&#39;s voice beginning to grow frantic 
now. &quot;Elly? Elly!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going, what happened!&quot; I hear Jin&#39;s voice now, panicking as much 
as MOMO&#39;s.

&quot;Oh my god, I can&#39;t believe she was piloting like that in her 
condition!&quot; Allen speaks next.

&quot;C&#39;mon, we have to get her to the infirmary, quick!&quot; I hear the 
Durandal&#39;s captain&#39;s voice next.

Their voices have virtually become deaf now, and I can&#39;t feel any part 
of my body anymore. I guess that doesn&#39;t matter right now, everyone is 
safe for the moment, that&#39;s all that really matters. Yes that&#39;s... 
all... that... really... matters...

----------

(chaos&#39;s POV)

Elly, I can&#39;t believe she went ahead and piloted that craft in her 
condition. If only I knew that it was that bad, I would&#39;ve done it for 
her. I&#39;m such an idiot, why didn&#39;t I...! It&#39;s just like that time so 
long ago. I failed &#39;her,&#39; I didn&#39;t do what was right and because of 
that, &#39;she...&#39;

&quot;She should be okay for now,&quot; MOMO&#39;s voice breaks me out of my 
pondering. &quot;But we have to get her to a hospital, she&#39;s lost a lot of 
blood and needs a transfusion as soon as possible.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, as soon as we get back to the Foundation I&#39;ll get her into 
the best hospital we have,&quot; Jr. assures her.

I begin to leave the infirmary at this point, I can&#39;t bear to see her 
like this. Back there, I couldn&#39;t sense her for a majority of the time 
unlike how I normally could. U-DO was always known to block our powers 
to an extent, it was stupid of me to assume that she was dead. And 
Pellegri, she&#39;s still acting as &#39;his&#39; messenger. She said we&#39;ll be 
meeting again soon, after all this time. Will I be ready to confront him 
this time? No, if I couldn&#39;t even confront &#39;her&#39; other half, there&#39;s no 
way I can confront him.

Miang... I thought she had regained her memory back by now. No, she did, 
but not all of it. She&#39;s been exhibiting some of her true potential, but 
not all of it. Is she even aware what she&#39;s really capable of? Can I 
even bring myself to fight her if we were to meet again? Whenever we 
confronted each other recently, she would always act as if she didn&#39;t 
recognize me. Her memory must not have been fully restored, I suppose it 
would make sense, Elly&#39;s true potential has not been fully realized 
either. It was foolish of me to suggest the idea to Citrine to contact 
her, it was stupid of me to assume that she had remembered everything 
that happened back then.

&quot;Hey chaos, you all right?&quot; I find myself wandering into the bridge now.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Captain, I guess I&#39;m just a bit under the weather, that&#39;s 
all,&quot; I answer.

&quot;That&#39;s not like you at all,&quot; Matthews tries to cheer me up, &quot;but then 
again, I can&#39;t blame you for acting the way you are after everything 
that just happened. The android girl&#39;s in critical condition, the 
cyborg&#39;s nearly destroyed, Miss Vector is in some sort of psychological 
shock, and on top of that, Old Miltia just crumbled into space dust.&quot;

&quot;This is all too cruel,&quot; I barely manage to speak. &quot;Every one of them 
has been forced into a cruel destiny all because of a single mistake 
made so long ago.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; my words causes confusion amongst the rest of the crew.

&quot;...it&#39;s nothing,&quot; I tell them. &quot;By the way, Captain,&quot; I try to change 
the subject, &quot;how did you manage to get rid of Yuriev&#39;s soldiers?&quot;

&quot;Actually...&quot;

Before the Captain can say another word, I begin to sense something. No, 
not something, someone hiding behind each of the different control 
panels in the cockpit. Before I know, these people suddenly come out of 
hiding, their guns all pointed at me.

&quot;Freeze!&quot; these individuals order.

&quot;What the! Captain, why...?&quot;

&quot;When you guys left, these guys came board on our ship shortly after and 
took care of the soldiers. We thought they were there to help us out, 
but then we found ourselves taken hostage by them. They ordered us to 
drop them off in Labyrinthos, but by the time we started heading there, 
the whole planet started shaking and there were you guys flying in that 
weird robot.&quot;

&quot;That weird robot is called an &#39;E.S.,&#39;&quot; one of the soldiers explains. 
&quot;Sorry about the rude introductions, boy, but it was necessary for us to 
commandeer your ship.&quot;

&quot;You... You&#39;re Meris Orthas of Scientia, aren&#39;t you?&quot; I immediately 
recognize the woman&#39;s face.

&quot;Her great-granddaughter actually,&quot; the woman corrects me.

I begin to wrap my fingers into fists at this point, but each of the 
soldiers quickly notices this, cocking their guns once again as a 
reaction to my own.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you,&quot; she tells me. &quot;I&#39;ve got several more 
men hiding throughout the rest of the ship. Make one wrong move and my 
men might have to resort to violence.&quot;

At that very moment I hear more men&#39;s orders echoing from the other side 
of the ship. Again I hear weapons being cocked and orders to stand down, 
along with my comrades being forced to comply. I should&#39;ve known it 
wouldn&#39;t be this easy to escape, but still, I know for a fact that this 
isn&#39;t &#39;his&#39; doing.

&quot;Ma&#39;am, you&#39;re not going to believe this,&quot; a Scientia soldier reports as 
soon as he reaches the bridge. &quot;There&#39;s a KOS-MOS unit here as well.&quot;

&quot;A KOS-MOS unit, are you serious!&quot; Meris exclaims.

&quot;There&#39;s something strange about this one though, ma&#39;am,&quot; the soldier 
continues. &quot;This one&#39;s on life support and in critical condition.&quot;

&quot;...that is strange, but that doesn&#39;t matter, that&#39;s not going to affect 
our plans,&quot; Meris tells the soldier. &quot;Captain, take your ship to these 
coordinates,&quot; she orders, handing him an electronic device. &quot;I know it 
seems like we&#39;re here to harm you, but that&#39;s not the case,&quot; she informs 
me now. &quot;We know you&#39;re from the Kukai Foundation, we simply want to ask 
you a few questions. There&#39;s also those two Vector employees and that 
KOS-MOS unit, we would like to question them too. As long as you answer 
our interrogation, we&#39;ll let all of you free.&quot;

Answer your interrogation, I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s impossible. It&#39;s bad enough 
that I&#39;ve gotten my friends involved, I don&#39;t want anyone else to get 
caught in the mistake I made so long ago. Friend or foe, I don&#39;t care, I 
don&#39;t want to see anyone else get hurt. I&#39;m sorry everyone, but this is 
all my fault...

----------

(Wilhelm&#39;s POV)

Fate, such a peculiar word. For many years Man has believed that their 
lives were pre-ordained, in fact, many still believe in this notion. 
Does such a thing called &quot;destiny&quot; truly exist, or does Man create his 
own kismet with his &quot;free will?&quot;

&quot;Master Wilhelm,&quot; my red-cloaked subordinate interrupts my thoughts, &quot;I 
wish to give a report. Citrine and Voyager have retrieved the Zohar, it 
is currently in the hands of the Ormus Organization as you ordered.&quot;

&quot;I see, thank you for your report,&quot; I tell my subordinate.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I am not finished, sir,&quot; he continues. &quot;Dimitri Yuriev has 
been trying to contact you about this decision; he is currently on the 
line, will you take his call?&quot;

&quot;Yes, patch him through,&quot; I answer.

I turn my attention to the video phone on my desk now, the screen 
revealing me a face I have not seen in a short while. Short while, maybe 
it isn&#39;t so short when comparing it to the life span of others.

&quot;Dr. Yuriev, what do I owe the pleasure?&quot; I answer the line.

&quot;Spare me the pleasantries, Wilhelm,&quot; the man spits, as crude as ever. 
&quot;Why did you send the Zohar to the hands of the Ormus Organization? I 
thought we agreed...!&quot;

&quot;Yes, we did agree, good doctor,&quot; I interrupt, trying to calm the man 
down. &quot;The Zohar will be yours, but be patient a little longer.&quot;

&quot;A little longer, that was exactly what you told me a century ago!&quot; the 
doctor continues to lecture. &quot;It may not seem like a long time to you, 
but...!&quot;

&quot;Is a week sufficient enough?&quot; I interrupt once more. &quot;Before we can 
hand the Zohar to you, we need one week for... another project.&quot;

&quot;&#39;Another project?&#39;&quot; he scoffs. &quot;Just how many more do you need 
until...?&quot;

&quot;This will be the last before we can obtain our goal, I assure you.&quot;

&quot;You better be telling the truth, my patience runs thin, Wilhelm,&quot; he 
says, beginning to calm down.

&quot;You have my word.&quot;

&quot;Do I really? Just remember this, don&#39;t even think about backing down on 
our deal, otherwise I&#39;ll expose everything you and your subordinates 
have been up to for the last several millennia.&quot;

And with that, the man hangs up. The fool, does he think his threat 
scares me? Even if he were to attempt to expose everything, he would too 
would expose the truth of his existence. I do intend to keep my promise 
to him, after all, we did create that alliance nearly a century ago 
after the Voyager Investigation, even if that alliance has been shaky. 
Even if you do plan on breaking that alliance, I have the &#39;White Horse&#39; 
ready to act at any given moment. Yes, you&#39;ll get what&#39;s coming to you, 
my good doctor.

&quot;Master Wilhelm, I&#39;m afraid I must question you on something,&quot; I look up 
to still find my subordinate standing in the same place. &quot;It regards 
Miang...&quot;

&quot;Miang? What is it you wish to ask about?&quot; I ask.

&quot;During the last battle, you ordered Voyager to reprogram Ziggurat 8, 
even though it was only temporary, but then you had Miang destroy his 
mechanical limbs. I&#39;m aware that you are attempting to temporarily 
disable all obstacles just as you did with Elly&#39;s capture, but I still 
don&#39;t understand why you didn&#39;t awaken the &#39;final one&#39; when you had the 
chance?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s quite simple, despite how strong the &#39;Mother of Destiny&#39; is, she 
is still fragile emotionally. If she were to experience anymore trauma 
during the time, she would be unable to cope with so much loss and 
undoubtably commit suicide as a result. There is also the fact that &#39;he&#39; 
has no reason to advance to another existence at the moment. As a 
wiseman once said &#39;the fate of destruction is also the joy of rebirth,&#39; 
that is why we must prolong his &#39;birth.&#39;&quot;

&quot;I see... While we are on the subject of Miang, I must also report on 
her actions lately.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m already aware of them. I know that she spared those Scientia 
soldiers and fought with Orgulla, but I already have something planned 
to fix her recent misbehavior. After all, that&#39;s why we also created 
&#39;her.&#39;&quot;

&quot;&#39;Her?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I answer, pressing a button underneath my desk.

The flooring in the center of the room begins to split now as another 
metal platform makes its way up from the hole. The platform isn&#39;t empty 
however, for my main attraction also rests in a container that sits upon 
it. It isn&#39;t long before the new floor appears, and in the center of it, 
is where &#39;she&#39; rests.

&quot;Sir, this is...?&quot;

She&#39;s so beautiful as she sleeps; her pearl-white hair easily rivals the 
hue of her father&#39;s. Her skin is also exactly like his, and those eyes, 
it is almost frightening that they resemble one another so much in 
appearance. No, not just him, but &#39;her&#39; as well. Yes, she looks almost 
like her mother as well. It would bring me such pleasure I see your face 
when she finally awakens, when you two finally meet, when you see what 
we&#39;ve done with her. The drama, how I love a good drama.

&quot;Soon you shall be born, my dear,&quot; I place my hand on the glass. &quot;Soon, 
my beloved T-elos...&quot;

XenoMark&#39;s Note: I think this was the longest chapter I&#39;ve written so 
far, and it was probably also the most difficult. Sorry to leave it a 
cliffhanger here, but the chapter&#39;s long enough I think. Don&#39;t worry 
about Elly, she&#39;ll be okay in the next chapter (at least, okay in terms 
of health now that she and the others have been taken hostage by the 
Scientia Organization). As for T-elos, she&#39;s finally made her way into 
the fic, and we&#39;ll actually see her in action in the next chapter, so 
wait for it (hopefully I&#39;ll be able to update quicker than I did with 
this chapter). Also in the next chapter, expect to see a one-on-one 
conversation between Albedo and Citrine. Unfortunately though, we won&#39;t 
learn what chaos&#39;s &quot;mistake&quot; was in the past until later on in the fic, 
so please, watch out for it. If you want this fic to be updated quicker, 
please leave a review (but no flames please). I&#39;m also thinking about 
whether or not I should open up my own forum thread for my fics on but 
I&#39;m not sure, what do you readers think? Anyways, that&#39;s enough ranting, 
hope to see ya all in the next chapter.</pre>
