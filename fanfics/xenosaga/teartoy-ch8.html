<h1>Tears of Toys (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../xenosaga/index.html">Xenosaga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/albedoright.html">Albedo's right hand</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../xenosaga/teartoy-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>	A gentle hand slid down her sides removing the last barrier of 
fabric that hindered the one she loved. The hands started at her collar 
and gently worked there way down her form. Pangs of pleasure ran along 
her spine forcing a gasp to escape her lips.
	Her own sounds muffled by the lips that soon locked with her own.

*Beep!* *Beep!*

	Momo rolled onto her side and reached for the small bunny clock on 
her bed table. The sound continued as she grasped the cute disturber of 
sweet dreams and with all the might her small arm had she flung it at 
the opposite wall.

*Beep!* *Beep!* 
	
	Momo crawled out of her bed despising the cute little bunny clock 
for ruining such a wonderful dream. Her nightgown was wrinkled and hiked 
up almost to her armpits from rolling around in her sleep. She pulled 
the light fabric down to her knees and walked over to the bunny clock. 
She picked up the clock that was still beeping and pressed the off 
button.
	The morning was like any other one. First the alarm goes off then 
she would throw it at the wall. Then she would have to get out of her 
bed and pull down her nightgown, then walk over to the clock that was 
built to survive the throw. She would turn it off and get ready for the 
day. 
	Then when the fog of sleep finally lifted from her mind she 
remembered her dream and her face turned a bright red. She ran over to a 
full-length mirror to confirm that her face was as red as it felt. She 
shook her head but all that served to do was make her messy pink hair 
even messier.  
	She had never known she was capable of having a dream quite like 
that. She tried to push the images out of her head but it only served to 
clarify them. After the failed attempt to calm her busy mind she walked 
over to the dresser to choose what she would wear for the day.
	Soon after she was completely dressed she caught herself still 
replaying the dream over and over in her head. She shook her head in a 
futile attempt to remove the dream but all that did was make her messy 
pink hair even messier. She turned back to the dresser and grabbed a 
tower deciding to take a very cold shower.
	She walked through the busy corridors of the Durandle towards the 
Elsa preferring the shower rooms on the small vessel. She passed people 
who had to look down in order to meet her amber eyes and that had always 
unsettled her. 
	She walked into the Elsa and soon reached the change room that 
connected to the showers. The familiar &quot;Girls only&quot; sign Shion had made 
was stuck to the door in order to prevent someone from walking in. The 
sign was only made after a certain incident involving Allen seeing 
Shion.
	She stepped into the change room and soon discarded the clothes 
she changed into not too long ago. Now with only a towel wrapped around 
her she stepped into the change room expecting to see Shion but was 
shown a different sight than what she had expected.
	&quot;Darn it KOS-MOS how can you get so much sand in you?&quot; Shion 
exclaimed scrubbing furiously on the android&#39;s shoulder. The scientist 
and the weapon were both in towels and sitting on a bench that was part 
of the tiled wall.
	Momo&#39;s calm heart was racing again and she could tell she was 
bright red from seeing KOS-MOS in nothing but a towel. Shion waved for 
Momo to come over and Momo stepped slowly trying to settle her racing 
heart.
	&quot;Momo could you help me with her arm. I didn&#39;t think sand would be 
this difficult to remove.&quot; Momo rolled her eyes unable to even respond 
to such a remark. Momo picked up a scrub brush and began to work on the 
opposite arm.
	Momo took great care with the arm and she lost track of time as 
she painstakingly removed the sand that clung to her artificial flesh. 
She wouldn&#39;t have admitted it to even KOS-MOS but she envied the sand 
that was able to cling to the androids body. 
	&quot;Alright KOS-MOS. arms up!&quot; Shion chimed, and the innocence of 
cleaning the android soon left when Momo realized where she what she 
would be cleaning. KOS-MOS lifted her arms up so that Shion could start 
to scrub under her arm and Momo did her best to act normal.
	Shion&#39;s hand slipped and tugged slightly on the android&#39;s towel. 
KOS-MOS&#39;s hand flung towards her own chest with brake-neck speed as the 
towel pooled around her waist. KOS-MOS&#39;s hands were the only things 
preventing Momo from seeing every inch of skin on the android&#39;s torso.
	For a split second Momo just sat there gazing at the sight before 
her eyes...then her brain played through her dream from earlier. Momo 
yelled as she bolted from the showers screaming,
	&quot;AHH! Hormones!...Brain!...Ahhh!&quot; She ran down a hallway still in 
her towel, slamming hard into the soft beer-belly of Captain Matthews.
	&quot;Umm...Sorry! Sorry!&quot; She screamed as she bolted towards the 
female beds that were still on the Elsa. Matthews turned the other 
direction and yelled,
	&quot;Tony! Were the hell are you?&quot; The blond pilot walked out from 
around a corner and responded.
	&quot;What ya yelling for Matthews?&quot; Matthews pointed down the hallway 
to a Momo that was no longer there,
	&quot;A realian...in nothing but a towel! What do you have to do with 
this?&quot; he responded. Tony waved his hands in front of him in protest.


     Jr. was awoken from his dream by a searing pain in his forehead. He 
bolted from his sleep and looked around for the source of the pain and 
soon found that familiar eight ball he had slipped on. The only thing 
that proved it was the same ball was the hole clean through it by his 
bullet.
     &quot;The only thing about our mental link I dislike is that we share 
dreams...&quot; Jr. turned to see Gaignun by the door of the office.&quot;...Do 
you know how weird I feel when you give me a dream of you doing Sakura!&quot; 
Gaignun said, quite obviously annoyed by the images he had to endure 
with an older brother like Rubedo.
     &quot;Shut up Gaignun! Do you think I&#39;ll ever forget when you gave me 
that dream of you, Shion and Shelly!&quot; Gaignun shrugged his shoulders,
     &quot;At least Shion and Shelly are of the age of consent.&quot; He replied 
calmly.&quot; The younger brother left the room but stopped and turned 
around,
     &quot;Oh and please don&#39;t shoot my pool set. I payed good money for the 
actual wood in that pool table and had to go to the lion heart auction 
to get those pool balls.&quot; Jr. slumped back in his cushioned chair and 
reflected on that dream.
     It was like all the others he had been having. They always were 
Sakura but everything that happened in that dream was what he did with 
Momo. He despised himself about having such dreams and knew exactly how 
inappropriate it was to have them.
     The woman he loved would most likely hate him for such fantasies 
and he knew that Momo wouldn&#39;t be too happy about hearing it as well. He 
stood up and paced around the room trying to get his mind off such 
thoughts.
     He slumped back into his chair, &quot;I am a horrible person.&quot; He said 
meekly.
