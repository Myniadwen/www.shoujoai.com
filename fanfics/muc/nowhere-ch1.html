<h1>When We Have Nowhere Left to Hide</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../muc/index.html">Magic Users Club</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mahou.html">Mahou Kaijuu</a><br> </h2>
<pre>TiME: episode#11 of Mahou Tsukai Tai! TV series. There&#39;s no Jinno!

------------------------------------------------------------

Sae&#39;s point of view: Sae went home today alone. It was so strange,
seems like the houses had changed, like the street was larger, the
threes were taller. She couldn&#39;t give this feeling a name, she only
knew it was so close to &#39;loneliness&#39;. She looked up the dark cloudy
sky and got in her house, almost running to her bedroom. Her sister
wasn&#39;t home, as always. She was sitting by the window, still
watching the clouds and feeling the smell of rain that was about to
come.

***flashback***

Sae: &quot;Nanaka..i think you should do your best to get his love, I
can see he&#39;s changing, we all noticed he is changing somehow, I&#39;m
sure he likes you Nan..&quot;

Sae felt Nanaka&#39;s hand on her face. It hurts, it hurts so much. But
not the slap, not her face...Her heart hurts..

Nanaka: &quot;SHUT UP, SAE! CAN&#39;T YOU SEE WHAT YOU&#39;RE DOING? YOU ALWAYS
DO THIS, I AM SO SICK OF YOU!&quot;

Nanaka&#39;s eyes were full of tears. She ran away and didn&#39;t look
back.

Sae: &quot;N..Nanaka..Gomen..N..n..&quot;

Sae cried out, but Nanaka couldn&#39;t listen to Sae anymore. She had
gone already, without any regrets, without looking back.

***ends*flashback***

Sae sobs watching the first drops of water falling to the ground.

Sae: &quot;If she only knew how much she means to me..&quot; she said
quietly, like she was praying for something to happen.

She couldn&#39;t see Nanaka in pain because of a stupid guy like
Aburatsubo-senpai. How could someone in the world refuse Nanaka
Nakatomi!?? The most beautiful, charming, friendly girl Sae had
ever seen! she thought and looked to the phone. Maybe she has to
call Nanaka and say that she&#39;s sorry, that she only does that kind
of stuff because she loves her, because she wants to see Nanaka
happy, because Nanaka deserves the best! Yes, she had to tell
Nanaka everything! And that would be today!

When Sae finally was about to dial, the phone rang.

------------------------------------------------------------

Nanaka&#39;s point of view:

Nanaka went home today alone. It was so strange, seems like the
houses had changed, like the street was larger, the threes were
taller. She couldn&#39;t give this feeling a name, she only knew it was
so close to &#39;loneliness&#39;. She looked up the dark cloudy sky and got
in her house, almost running to her bedroom. Her brother was doing
nothing, as always. Her mother was yelling at her brother, like
normal. But she was sad..She sat down and opened a box that she
kept under her bed, perhaps the most precious thing she had: Sae&#39;s
letters, gifts and memories were all in that box. She started
reading all over again and remembered of what had happened that
afternoon at school. &lt;Sae is so stupid..In love with that
Takakura-jerky-senpai...Why does she worry so much about me anyway?

I think it&#39;s time to stop faking all this..I found
Aburatsubo-senpai to run away from my true feelings, but I can&#39;t
hide myself anymore! How come she never noticed my feelings about
her?&gt; she thought, looking at her phone. It was time. She had to
say everything to her best friend, say that she&#39;s sorry, say that
she&#39;s got beautiful eyes and that she&#39;s gorgeous...Nanaka dialed
Sae&#39;s number and waited for response.

------------------------------------------------------------

Sae: &quot;M..moshi-moshi. Sae desu&quot;

Nanaka: &quot;Hey there..It&#39;s me..Nanaka..&quot;

Sae: &quot;Hi..&quot; she said surprised, her heart beating fast.

Nanaka: &quot;Can I please talk to you..today..like, now..onegai..&quot;

Sae: &quot;But..why..&quot; Nanaka didn&#39;t let Sae finish her sentence.

Nanaka: &quot;Meet me at the Mahou Club room in 1 hour, please. It&#39;s
important. Oh, and take your magic wand! Don&#39;t forget about it!&quot;

Sae: &quot;H..hai..&quot;

*CLICK*

------------------------------------------------------------

Sae thought it was pretty odd, but didn&#39;t think about that too
much! she was in a hurry! She wore her club uniform, &#39;cos, if
Nanaka said she had to take her magic wand with her it&#39;s because
they would do magic, ne?

She got her bike and and went to the club room. She arrived a
little bit earlier, she didn&#39;t want to make Nanaka wait. She opened
the door and noticed a wonderful smell. It could be mahou, she
thought. But the good smell was coming from Nanaka&#39;s pale skin, she
could recognize it.

------------------------------------------------------------

Sae: &quot;Hi Nanaka..&quot;

Nanaka, turning to the door where Sae was standing: &quot;Hey Sae..come
in..&quot;

Sae, closing the door behind her: &quot;Hai..&quot;. she walked to Nanaka and
became ultrasonic, like only Sae could be:P: &quot;I just wanto say I&#39;m
sorry, i never wanna hurt you like that again, Nanaka, I promise
I&#39;ll shut up and stop saying stupid things about your feelings,
about Aburatsubo-senpai, I know you love him and he loves
Takakura-senpai, but I don&#39;t wanna see you so sad anymore, because
I just want to see you happy, because you&#39;re everything in my life
and because...&quot; 

&quot;I love you.&quot; Nanaka said, interrupting Sae, lifting her finger on 
Sae&#39;s lips. &quot;

Nanaka: &quot;Gomen nasai..i was keeping this secret in my heart for a
long time. I tried to hide my feelings behind Aburatsubo-senpai but
I couldn&#39;t hide it anymore. I was being too selfish, and I&#39;m sorry
Sae..I know you don&#39;t feel the same way about me, I know you must
be angry at me..But i feel so much better now that you know
everything. I&#39;m sorry Sae..&quot; She said, looking at her feet,
avoiding Sae&#39;s face. She saw something hit her shoe, it was like
water. It was a tear from Sae&#39;s eyes.

Sae: &quot;N..nanaka..&quot;

Nanaka looked up and saw Sae&#39;s face. It couldn&#39;t be true. Sae was
crying, but smiling. She was really smiling! She felt a hand on her
own hand, it was Sae&#39;s warm hand holding hers. She was quite
scared, she couldn&#39;t deny it. Sae came closer to Nanaka and got her
other hand. Nanaka was so hypnotized by Sae&#39;s eyes that didn&#39;t
notice she was against the wall and that Sae was coming closer.

Sae: &quot;I love you, Nanaka. I love you, I want you so much, you have
no idea of..&quot;

Nanaka paused Sae&#39;s words pressing her lips against hers. Sae felt
her body getting warm and it came with a nice need of desire. She
put her hands around Nanaka&#39;s waste and enjoined each second of
that kiss. They broke the kiss and looked at each other&#39;s face.

They were both with tears in her eyes, but smiling.

Sae: &quot;Ano...How are we going to tell the others? And what about our
family, and the school and everyone else at..&quot; Nanaka kissed Sae.

Nanaka: &quot;Just forget about them now..This is time to think about
us! Come on Sae, don&#39;t be such a fool!&quot; pinching Sae&#39;s butt. &quot;Did
you bring your magic wand?&quot; Nanaka asked. Sae took it and they put
the right card in both wands: the love card. They stayed with their
wands up and said the magic words then bright coloured lights
started to fly around the room. They both looked up, laughed and
kissed again. They were happy &#39;cos they knew: tonight was gonna be
unforgetable.
