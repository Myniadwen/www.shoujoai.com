<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Treading alone under the starry heavens, upon a street
lit by lamp poles that must have survived from the Second World War, Misono
Madoka wondered for the thousandth time whether it was a good decision to leave
Saitama on an express train and return to </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Tokyo</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">. True, the business meeting between Hakusensha,
represented by Madoka and her elderly supervisor, and another firm had
concluded two hours ago, which meant that she could go wherever she wanted.
But... her supervisor had insisted that she stay and take advantage of all the
service that the first class hotel they were staying in had to offer, all
expenses paid by the gray-haired lady herself. Yet, despite her supervisor’s
gracious offer, despite the fact that it was by no means safe to travel alone
at night, she had hopped on the earliest express train bound for home.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘Mariko.’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">
Her daughter’s name floated across her mind. The child was the reason Madoka
risked the displeasure of her supervisor, something she had tried her very best
to avoid during the last ten years. Still, it wasn’t as if she had a choice.
Mariko was all that she had left in this world, the only treasure that her
beloved husband left with her when he was killed in that nasty car accident.
Madoka simply didn’t have the heart to leave the child home all by herself two
nights in a row. What if she fell? What if someone broke into the house before
she could call for help? What if...? Madoka forced herself to stop thinking
about what could happen to Mariko when she was away. The more she did, the more
anxious she would be, and the more stress would be placed on her already
fragile heart. It would be a great irony if she suffered from a heart attack
and died here on the street even when her daughter was safe and sound.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Yet... even though she had commanded herself to be
calm numerous times during the walk home and assured herself equal amount of
times that the Gods wouldn’t be giving her, someone already swimming in an
ocean of hardship, more problems to deal with, Madoka found her eyes fixed at
something lying just a little bit beyond her doorstep. There was no light in
the house except that of the silver moon reigning on high... yet she was dead
sure she was looking at a pair of white sneakers belonging to a person she had
come to dislike very much despite their short period of acquaintance. Those
were Shouji An’s, there was no doubt about it. Her heart stopped, her blood ran
cold, and her hands clenched into fists. What the hell was the damn girl doing
in Madoka’s house in the middle of the night? And where was she? Why was she
not in the living room, the only place in which she was permitted to stay
whenever she made one of her annoying visits?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Suddenly feeling suffocated, she walked toward her
daughter’s room, the door to which, she noticed immediately, was left ajar.
From the small opening, a very dim light was spilling out into the hallway. It
was barely brighter than the light of the crescent moon outside… but it was
more than enough to let Madoka see that her daughter wasn’t alone on the bed.
The child, most of her body except her head covered by a thick blanket, was
snoozing soundly next to Shouji An, who also seemed to be immersed in a deep
slumber. When Madoka’s eyes fell on the floor near the bed, she saw a small
pile of clothing articles the content of which suggested to Madoka that the two
persons on the bed were wearing nothing but their skin.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As if struck by a steel hammer, Madoka staggered
backward and had to put a hand on the wall to steady herself. Slowly, with her
mind devoid of thoughts, she dragged her body, which currently seemed to weigh
at least a mountain, to the living room and sat down heavily on the old couch.
There, she pulled out her medication box from her bag and hurriedly swallowed a
few tablets. Then she buried her face in her hands and feel her whole self shaking
in a hurricane formed by feelings of anger, disappointment, and regret.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She was angry at herself for creating such a window of
opportunity. Had she tried a little bit harder, she could have got out of the
business trip with her supervisor and none of this would have happened under
her roof. She was disappointed at her daughter, to whom Madoka devoted all her
time and effort, for having committed such a twisted act of perversion. Had it
been a man, Madoka could have found it in her to forgive and forget... yet this
was a girl her daughter had brought to her bed, a girl three years her junior.
And of course, she regretted that in spite of her love for her daughter and her
reluctance to hurt the child, Madoka was going to make sure that Shouji An
stayed out of Mariko’s life forever.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The more she thought about it, the more Madoka felt
that her newly made decision was right. Her daughter deserved better than a
brat who had nothing better to do than seducing other women. She only wished
that she had come to this conclusion a couple of months ago, when she first
found out about her daughter’s true relationship with Shouji An. Had she
realized what kind of horrific road her daughter was walking down at that time,
had she realized that everything would come to this, she would have been firm
and resolute and nipped the danger in the bud.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Still... it was not too late to right her wrongs now.
Of course, she was fully aware that she was about to crush Mariko’s happiness
with her own hands… yet she wouldn’t let the knowledge impede her. In time, the
child would realize that all that Madoka did was for her sake. One day, when
Mariko was finally married to an upstanding man and had children, she would
thank Madoka from the bottom of her heart. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Determined, she rose to her feet and walked back
toward the hallway. She stopped abruptly, however, when the door to Mariko’s
room opened and admitted Shouji An, whose lower thighs and legs were visible
beneath her long T-shirt, whose face was wild with embarrassment, whose mouth was
hanging open in the dimness of the bed lamp’s light, whose eyes were filled
with shock and fear. The seventeen-year-old appeared to be looking at a ghost.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Peering into the room, Madoka was infinitely relieved
that her daughter hadn’t woken up.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oba... san?” Shouji managed in a tight voice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Evening, Shouji-san,” Madoka replied coolly. It was a
good thing that the brat came out of the room on her own. This way, Madoka
didn’t  have to walk into the room, drag her out of the bed, and risked an
episode of drama with her daughter, which surely she had no need of. “Why don’t
you... put on some <i>more</i> clothes,” her eyes regarded the
seventeen-year-old with unconcealed distaste, which made her flinch and blush
crimson, “and come back here? We’ll go to a coffee shop nearby. I’d like to
have a talk.” She added when Shouji turned toward the entrance to Mariko’s
room, “And please, don’t wake my daughter.” She gave no reason... but from the
girl’s expression, pale even in the dim light, she understood.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’ll... be right back,” Shouji mumbled and walked
into the room with her tail between her legs.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka returned to the living room, picked up her bag,
and waited for the brown-haired girl at the door. A few minutes later, the brat
emerged, her face as uneasy as ever. Neither muttering even a word, they left
the apartment, took the elevator down to the lobby, and walked out the
automatic sliding doors of </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanagawa Place</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">. When they made a left turn immediately afterwards,
they found themselves in front of a small but nicely decorated coffee shop,
which was mounted with a glaring neon sign that read “<i>Starbrooks</i>”. This
place was where Madoka stopped by every morning, sat down, and blissfully
enjoyed the exquisite smoothness of the shop’s specialty drink before she
subjected herself to the merciless grinding machine that was her job.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Misono-san!” the shop owner, a plump woman who was
about half a dozen years older than Madoka, exclaimed the moment she pushed
open the glass door. “What are you doing here at this time?” She glanced at her
wristwatch. “When I’m about to close down, no less!” The other employees, all
of whom Madoka had known for the last ten years, stopped their cleaning and
moping and looked at her, appearing equally surprised. Some raised their hands
and waved to her. She addressed them each with a warm smile before she turned
to the owner.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry, Inoue-san,” Madoka said, feeling a little
bit more peaceful under the cool light cascading down from the halogen tubes
hanging on the shop’s ceiling. The sight of this familiar place and those
familiar faces always had a soothing effect on her. “I just need a place to sit
down and discuss something with my companion. It won’t take long. Can you...
settle us down somewhere quiet?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Inoue-san arched an eyebrow at her questioningly, but
when the woman received no answer in return, she nodded and gestured her hand
toward a corner in the back of the shop, where a table just for two sat
solitarily without any attendants hovering nearby. And if Inoue Ritsuko was the
woman Madoka had known all these years, she would make sure that no one would
come within twenty feet of that table while they were talking.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Do you want something to drink, Misono-san?” the shop
owner inquired.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Just a cup of tea, thanks,” Madoka answered.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Kiddo?” Inoue-san glanced at Shouji, who was standing
at the threshold and looking at the interior of the shop with troubled eyes. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Uh, I’d like a glass of water, I think,” the
brown-haired girl muttered uneasily, sweat beading on her forehead despite the
cold weather.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay.” The plump shop owner nodded and smiled.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Under the bewildered gazes of the shop’s employees,
she proceeded to the corner quietly with the seventeen-year-old brat following
on her heels. Once they had settled down, one facing the other across the table,
she realized that Shouji was being frightened out of her wits. Perhaps it was
Madoka’s cold, sharp stare. Perhaps it was the unfamiliar surrounding. Or
perhaps it was both, she didn’t really care. Although, she reckoned, it was a
good thing that the kid had already been pushed out of balance. The more scared
Shouji was, the easier it would be for Madoka to achieve her purpose.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oba-san...” the brat began.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Misono-san,”</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">
Madoka corrected, her voice cold and hard. The kid’s complexion went even paler
than the moon shining bright beyond the glass window. Outside, the empty alley
it looked over appeared decidedly dark and ominous.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> “Misono-san,” Shouji managed in the end, “you came
back early.” Then she stopped. Madoka suspected that it wasn’t what the girl
intended to say at all.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Isn’t that a good thing?” she said. “If I hadn’t, I
would never have known what kind of <i>despicable</i> acts you two were
engaging in when I was away.” Her voice was low lest it carry to the wrong
ears, but she made sure that it conveyed her displeasure and anger as best it
could. Shouji’s involuntary wince was proof that Madoka had succeeded.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Silence ensued while the brat dropped her gaze to her
lap and started plucking at her sweater.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Refreshments, anybody?” said the kind-faced Inoue
Ritsuko, who was approaching with a tray in her hands. With a grace that not
many people would expect from her slightly stocky figure, the woman put down a
cup of tea in front of Madoka, a glass of water in front of Shouji An, and a
dish of cookies in the middle of the table. After that, she silently retreated
toward the register, from where sometimes she would look in their direction
with a face painted by sheer curiosity. Of course, anyone would wonder why
Madoka wasn’t home at this moment to care for her paraplegic daughter, but
here, talking to a stranger who seemed to be trying to shrink herself on her
seat.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Did your father know of this?” Madoka asked, her
voice growing no warmer, her tone no less sharp.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“He doesn’t,” Shouji replied, eyes still on her lap.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Go figures,” Madoka said. “I can’t imagine any parent
would give his child permission to...” she paused, trying to find a way to
state the fact in an acceptable manner. She couldn’t find any, as the mere
recollection of what she had seen in Mariko’s room made the flame of anger roar
from the pit of her stomach. Madoka managed to keep her hands on the table, but
she failed to stop them from trembling. The brat in front of her noticed, and
her face went even paler than before, if that was possible. Yet... a light of
defiance shone in her deep blue eyes. That, of course, did nothing to bring
peace to Madoka’s lethal mood.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Who started it?” she demanded.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Shouji gave her an odd look, remained quiet for a few
seconds, then spoke up, “I did.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Unable to restrain her anger, Madoka reached across
the table and slapped the insolent brat. The sound of her hand landing on
Shouji’s cheek suddenly turn the atmosphere of coffee shop, which was extremely
noisy just a second ago with people cleaning up every corner except theirs,
into that of a graveyard in the dead of night. She wasn’t looking, so she
didn’t know whether everybody in the shop was looking at them. Yet, she knew
for a certainty that they were. She could <i>feel</i> their questioning eyes on
her. She could almost <i>hear</i> the thoughts revolving in their heads. Only
fleetingly did she consider explaining this episode of drama to them
afterwards.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How dare you?” Madoka hissed while the
seventeen-year-old stared ahead, her eyes widened in shock, her right cheek
imprinted with a large reddening mark in the shape of a hand. “Don’t you have
anything better to do than dragging my daughter along your twisted path? Why
didn’t you keep your sick obsession to yourself and leave Mariko alone?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sick obsession?” Shouji repeated, her words holding
no heat even after being struck. Her voice, quiet and low, contained only agony
and sadness. “What’s so sick about me loving her?” If she thought she could
invoke Madoka’s sympathy, though, she was dead wrong. All Madoka ever harbored
toward her was hostility and distaste.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“The fact that you are of the same gender, is there
anything else?” Madoka snapped. “Normal girls don’t go after each other like
dogs in heat.” She gave the seventeen-year-old a disgusted look. “If you can’t
understand something simple as that, you’re much more of a dimwit than I
expected.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You mean you’ll never approve unless Mariko’s partner
is a man?” If Shouji was offended, she hid it well. Strangely enough, however,
apprehension was slowly withdrawing from her like a tide ebbing from the beach,
leaving behind a sense of composure that was forming across her face. Fear was
suddenly nowhere to be seen in the brat’s blue eyes, which were now gazing at
Madoka with a feeling that she could only name... pity<i> </i>and<i> </i>exasperation.
Madoka’s hand itched to slap that look off Shouji’s face, but she stopped
herself in time. It was shameful enough for to have hit the kid once, and she
was already regretting it for having let her temper get the better of her, so
she wasn’t going to make the same mistake again.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">But oh Gods... how much she wanted to....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Isn’t it obvious?” Madoka answered roughly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why does it have to be a guy, Misono-san?” the
seventeen-year-old said, her voice dead serious. “What is it that he can give
her that I cannot?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Stability!” Madoka declared. “Look at you, you’re
just a brat who has to rely on her father’s money to live. She needs a man who
can support her financially for the rest of her life.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Men aren’t the only ones who can do that,” Shouji
countered. “You’re right. I currently don’t have a yen that I can call my own,
but it’s not going to stay that way forever. After I’ve earned my degree, I
will find a job and make enough money to provide for both of us.” She locked
eyes with Madoka, her expression growing firm. “You are no more of a man than I
am, Misono-san, yet weren’t you the person who has raised Mariko to be the
respectable woman she is today? You of all people should know that not many men
have the willpower and the patience to accomplish what you’ve spent the last
ten years doing.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Words died in Madoka’s throat. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> “I’m aware that we being together will turn us into
the target of people who despise what they refuse to understand,” there wasn’t
a hint of mockery in the seventeen-year-old’s tone, yet it still made Madoka’s
blood boil, “but Mariko and I are willing to take the risk. As long as she
still loves me....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She doesn’t! No matter what you may choose to
believe, she doesn’t love you!” Madoka broke in scathingly. Shouji An was
nothing but a seventeen-year-old who knew nothing about the world. Madoka
surely wasn’t going to let the girl bandy words with her and win. Especially
not when the stake was the future happiness of her daughter. “Because of her
condition, she’s emotionally insecure and vulnerable to your advances. That’s
how you’ve managed to intrude so deeply into her life!” Her voice’s loudness
started to grow out of control. “When Mariko regains the ability to walk,
she’ll realize that she has options! She’ll see that she can find a man who
will....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Are you even aware of what you’re saying,
Misono-san?” The brown-haired girl stared at her in utmost incredulity.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What?” Madoka fired back, her voice echoing loudly in
the shop.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re her mother, yet you don’t understand her at
all,” the brat challenged. “Mariko has never been so weak-willed she has to
cling to someone else for emotional comfort!” Her words were sharp, her eyes
burning, and her fists clenching atop the table. Anybody would have agreed that
Shouji An had taken what Madoka said as a personal insult. “Options <i>when</i>
she can walk again? Are you serious? Mariko has <i>always</i> had options. Or
do you honestly believe that she can’t find a man for her romantic interest
because she’s on a wheelchair? You have no faith, don’t you? You think that
there’s no one on Earth who would choose your daughter if they knew they would
have to care for her for the rest of her life the way you did during the last
ten years, don’t you?” Shouji shook her head in disappointment. “Why don’t you
ask yourself whether you want Mariko in the care of someone who can only love
her when she’s able to walk?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka’s blood ran cold. Yet, after a while, the
flames of anger once again raged in her heart.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Abruptly standing up, Madoka grabbed her cup of tea
and hurled its content at the seventeen-year-old’s face. Afterwards, she
slammed the cup upon the table and shrieked, “I will give you your last
warning, Shouji-san. Do not come near my daughter ever again. If you do, I’ll
call the police!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Then she hurried toward the entrance, not bothering to
say goodbye to her friend Inoue Ritsuko, whose face was strangely unreadable as
she looked at Madoka storming out of her shop.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

coffee shop, Shouji Ichitaka smiled softly to himself. Finally, he had found a
way to deliver his Gods-damned daughter into Minamoto Iriya’s hands without
having to deal with the brat’s bodyguard. Who could have thought that he could
have missed the solution to his dilemma had he given up and gone home a couple
of hours ago? It was providence, he was sure. Silently, he offered a prayer as
his token of gratitude to all the powers that were then slipped into the
darkness under the vast heavens.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

was dripping from her face, Shouji An merely stared forward at the empty chair
left by Misono Madoka, mother to the woman she loved. Her head was void of
thoughts and her hearts, emotions. She felt dazed. She felt stunned. She felt
as if the world was spinning rapidly around her. She thought she was about to
throw up.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Are you okay, kiddo?” a female voice said and made An
raise her head. The woman who had greeted Madoka when they entered the shop was
standing by the table, her hand holding a clean towel, her round face radiating
warmth and kindness. Not asking for An’s permission, Inoue-san, she seemed to
remember that it was what Madoka had called the woman, bent over and gently
dabbed the fuzzy cloth at An’s face. “I’m sorry Misono-san... did this to you.”
An stared. It had been years since her mom died... but if that blessed lady was
still living today, she would look at An with the same motherly expression. She
felt moisture gathering in her eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m... fine,” she lied.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I heard her name you Shouji-san,” Inoue-san continued
as she sat down on the other chair. “Is your given name An, by any chance?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How... do you know?” She went wide-eyed at the
kind-faced lady.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I heard about you from Misono-san’s daughter,” she
explained. “I visited her frequently when her mom’s off to work, you see.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah,” was the only response An could come up with.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You are... Mariko’s girlfriend, weren’t you?”
Inoue-san said quietly, her hands folded on the table’s top. “I’m sorry I
overheard your conversation... but Misono-san’s voice was very loud toward the
end.” She grimaced.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes.” An nodded, uncertain as to what was going to
happen. Based on the friendly manner with which they treated each other, this
woman... seemed to be Misono Madoka’s close acquaintance. Did they... happen to
share the same view about her and Mariko’s relationship, too? She eyed the
glassful of water standing near Inoue-san’s hands uneasily. Being splashed with
liquid once this evening was more than enough. She wondered if she should just
excuse herself and leave before the shop owner had a chance to reach for the
glass.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Don’t give up.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I beg your pardon?” An’s head snapped up. That wasn’t
what she expected to hear.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No matter what happens, kiddo, don’t give up,”
Inoue-san repeated gently. “Misono-san is a tough nut to crack, but don’t let
her intimidate you.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why are you telling me this?” An asked, surprised. “I
thought you were... her friend.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I am.” The plump woman gave her a rueful smile. “But
that doesn’t mean that I agreed with whatever she said. She was very...
unpleasant to you, I must admit.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s... okay,” An muttered. “I kinda expected it from
the very beginning. I knew she wouldn’t accept me. Didn’t know that it would
have gone... so badly, though.” The more she talked, the more bitter her voice
grew. So much for trying to keep their relationship in the dark. So much for
waiting for a convenient opportunity to tell Madoka. So much for wanting to
spend the last two weeks with Mariko in happiness before she flew away to </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">America</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> and
left An back here for one full, torturous year.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A tear leaked from a corner of her eyes and rolled off
her cheeks. Before she knew, she was already sobbing uncontrollably in her
hands. How was she supposed to live through the next two weeks, during which
she couldn’t even see Mariko’s face? This... was not meant to happen.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">At that moment, her cell phone suddenly rang from
within her pants’ pocket. The ring tone identified the caller as her beloved
girlfriend. Wiping her tears with the sleeve of her sweater, she pulled the device
out and answered the call.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Where did you go in the middle of the night, An?”
Misono Mariko, sitting on the bed with the blanket wreathing around her body,
asked worriedly when the door to her room opened. To her shock, the one who
entered was not the girl who had shared her bed just a couple of hours ago
before she fell asleep, but her mother, Misono Madoka. She was standing at the
threshold, face grim, lips thinned, eyes filled with unspeakable rage.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A terrible chill wrecked Mariko’s body apart. When did
her mom return? Was she the reason to An’s sudden disappearance? What did she
do with her?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She went home,” her mom announced frostily. “And
she’s not going to see you ever again. I’ll make sure of that. Goodnight,
Mariko.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka slammed the door shut.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Trembling, Mariko reached for her cell phone and
dialed her girlfriend’s numbers.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mariko?” An’s voice cracked painfully on the other
side of the line. The high school freshman spoke only one word... yet it was
more than enough for Mariko to realize that An had been crying before she
picked up the phone. She sensed her heart clench inside her chest. An wasn’t a
girl who shed her tears easily. Madoka must have done something terrible to the
girl to have made her cry like this.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Where are you, An?” she asked anxiously, hand
gripping her mobile wireless. “Are you okay?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m... in the Starbrooks coffee near your house,” her
girlfriend answered with the same tattered voice. “And... I’m okay.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko heaved a sigh of relief. She knew everybody in
that coffee shop to be decent, hardworking people, especially Inoue Ritsuko-san
the owner, who always bought Mariko something every time she visited. If An was
there with them at the moment, she should be in good hands.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What happened?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There was a moment of silence on the phone before the
Touyou Eiwa freshman’s voice returned, “When some strange noise in the house
woke me up in the middle of the night, I left the room to check it out. Then...
I saw your mom. She asked me to go with her to the coffee shop and have a
talk.” An stopped abruptly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Tell me everything, An, please,” Mariko urged.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Her girlfriend complied.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry about what she said,” Mariko said quietly
afterwards as agony and disappointment surged in her every vein. She never
imagined that something so... hurtful could come from the mouth of Misono
Madoka, the mother she so dearly cherished. Neither did she expect the
situation to have deteriorated this badly just two weeks before her flight.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It isn’t your fault,” the high school freshman
replied. “It’s mine. I said something terrible to your mom. I made her angry.
If I hadn’t lost my head, perhaps there was a chance that I could persuade her.
But I just had to screw everything up.” She sighed deeply afterwards, sounding
on the verge of tears again.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An,” Mariko called her lover’s name softly. “Will you
listen to my selfish request?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sure.” Somehow, Mariko detected fear in that one
single word. Maybe An was afraid that Mariko was proposing a break-up. She’d be
surprised.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I know it’s not right doing it over the phone,
especially under this circumstance, but I don’t think I will ever get the
chance to see you face to face anymore,” Mariko murmured, sensing her heart
picking up the pace. “But when I come back here from the States, no matter the
result of my treatment, will you... marry me?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Deafening silence followed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A few years back, when the Civil Rights groups heavily
pressured the government to follow the example of other progressive countries
in the world, the latter had no choice but to acquiesce to the former’s
demands. That had been when the name and the benefits of <i>“marriage”</i> were
extended to virtually all citizens regardless of the gender of the person they
chose for a partner. Madoka didn’t sit very well with that. She thought of the
government as spineless and always showed her disgust whenever the TV or the
newspaper mentioned the issue.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You don’t want to, An?” she continued after several
minutes of no reply from the one she loved.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Of course I do!” An’s voice echoed through the phone,
mingling with wonder and disbelief. “That’s what I’ve always wished for. But...
but... your mom....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Has no say over this matter,” Mariko assured her.
“I’m an adult, and I have the right to choose my life partner. And that
person... is you, An.” The threat Madoka delivered An was empty and she knew
it. The police couldn’t do a thing unless they had Mariko’s approval, which
they were never going to get.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s not that, Mariko,” An’s voice said. “Are you
aware of the effect this would have on your mom?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I know it’ll break her heart,” Mariko admitted,
sighing.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Then why...?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What is the other alternative? Breaking <i>your</i>
heart <i>and</i> <i>mine</i> by abandoning you? That’s one decision I can’t
make. I simply can’t imagine spending the rest of my life that way, An.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why are you telling me this, Mariko? Why did you ask
me to marry you out of the blue?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Because I want you to know that no matter what
happens, no matter how hard my mother tries to take you away from me, I will
never stop loving you or wanting to stay by your side,” she whispered. “So

given life to her, loving her, and caring for her during the last ten years.
Yet... that fact didn’t mean that Mariko was willing to sacrifice her love for
An just because her mom failed to understand that the Touyou Eiwa freshman held
in her hands Mariko’s heart. Besides, it wasn’t as if she were going to leave
Madoka for good in any case. Mariko was more than determined to become the
bridge that brought her mom and An together. She refused to believe she
couldn’t make Madoka change her mind. In fact, she fully intended to achieve
her goal during the time she was going to spend in </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">America</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">. If
the Gods were willing, a year from now, the three of them would be able to live
happily under the same roof.</span></p>

her voice trembling more violently than ever. “If worse comes to worst, the
relationship between you and your mom would be destroyed.”</span></p>

love you too much to live without you now, An.”</span></p>

her eyes, hearing her voice break. “Just one year, and I’ll be back to where
you are. Then I will never leave you ever again. I promise.”</span></p>

while settling down again upon the chair opposite that of the brown-haired girl,
who had just hung up. She had inconspicuously taken her leave when she realized
that the person who called the poor kid was none other than Misono Madoka’s
daughter so that they could have a moment together. “You seemed much happier
than before you picked up the phone, kiddo.” That was an understatement,
actually. Ritsuko would wager all the money in her safe that if she were to
give the tomboy all the gold in the world, she still wouldn’t be able to
produce such a wondrous expression on the girl’s face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mariko... she... proposed to me,” Shouji An said, her
wet blue eyes filled with an indescribable joy no sunlight could possibly
outshine. “She said she would like to marry me when she gets back from the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">U.S.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">” As soon
as she was done, she gave a violent start and took up a study of her sweater.
An probably didn’t know it herself why she disclosed something so personal to
someone she barely knew for fifteen minutes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah! I’m so glad for you!” Ritsuko exclaimed,
astonished.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Thank you,” An murmured gratefully.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘The Misono kid was bold, gotta give her that,’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Ritsuko mused to herself. She had always thought that
Mariko was the kind of character who was easily influenced by her parent, who
worshipped her mother and would never even think of doing something that the
latter didn’t wish her to. Turned out that it was a terrible misconception.
Misono Mariko, based on what Ritsuko just heard from the teenager Shouji An,
was steel hidden under a layer of cloth. In that, she resembled Inoue Mizuki,
Ritsuko’s child.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Misono Madoka was never aware... but the truth was...
Mizuki was now married to her childhood friend, a young woman whom she had
known her entire life. They lived in the same neighborhood, they went to the
same schools, they participated in the same club, and they found jobs in the
same company after graduating from college. Of course, Ritsuko, like any
parents, had the surprise of her life when her daughter and her friend came
back home one day to ask for her blessing. Ritsuko reacted very violently at
first and refused to give the children what they wanted. As a result, she was
infuriated when the two of them went ahead and married each other without her
approval. Yet... in time, her anger waned, and she learned to accept the fact
that one didn’t have to be a man to make Mizuki happy. They reconciled... and
Ritsuko even grew to love the person her daughter had chosen the way she loved
the latter. Now, they would return every weekend to pay her a visit, take her
out shopping, and spend their precious family time together.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Fully aware of Misono Madoka’s feelings toward such a
touchy issue, Ritsuko never discussed it with the woman. She didn’t hate the
middle-aged office lady for that, though. Despite being sadly mistaken about <i>“how
the world should be”,</i> as Madoka would say in her own words, she was one of
the most respectable parent that a kid could possibly want, and Ritsuko admired
her for it. Besides, Ritsuko knew what the other woman was going through,
having walked that road herself, so she sympathized with Madoka and hoped that
her friend would soon realize that it was always a mistake trying to decide
whom her daughter could love.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well now, since everything seems to be working out
alright for you, why don’t we do a little bit of celebration before I close down?
Would you like my shop’s specialty cake, kiddo? On the house, of course.” She
gave An a smile and prayed with all her might that the Gods above would grant
this poor girl sitting in front of her the abundant happiness that they had
bestowed upon her own kid.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“So, that’s what happened,” Mitsuki Kanae concluded
and drank the rest of her orange juice. It was a beautiful Monday afternoon, in
which she didn’t have to go to school due to a national holiday, and she was
sitting at a table for two in a Chinese restaurant in Shimokitazawa Mall.
Opposite her was Kozuka Hiroyuki, the once captain of the Crimson Knights in
The World, a lean young man with short straight hair and a face that
demonstrated very well what kind of personality he had. He wasn’t exactly
hunk-handsome , yet Kanae was willing to bet that the girls in her class, who
spent most of their time dreaming of meeting a mature and reliable guy, would
totally fawn over Hiroyuki. His dark eyes were sharp, his expression solemn,
his mouth seldom <i>not</i> thinned in a straight line, and his square jaw
usually set with grim determination. <i>‘Perfect for military recruitment,’</i>
she thought.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Since their unusual encounter at Hiroyuki’s par-time
job two weeks ago, Kanae had been visiting the video store almost every
afternoon after class. One reason was that the place had a great collection of
movies, many of which she never watched. The other reason, well, she was bored,
and Hiroyuki was nearby and... convenient. Despite his seemingly dry
appearance, he was actually an interesting man. Having worked for the video
store for the last five years or so, he had met many kinds of people and
accrued a staggering amount of funny anecdotes, which he freely shared with her
and made her laugh.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Well... sure, they didn’t really have good history
with each other in The World, and more often than not their differences in
personal belief pitched them against each other in fierce debates in which
neither wanted to yield. Sure, sometimes she experienced a very strong urge to
look for something sharp – or blunt, depending on how murderous she was feeling
at that moment – and hit him with it. Yet, for some unknown reason she was
rather... fond of the man’s stubbornness, rigidity, and antiquated idea of
honor and chivalry. To her... Hiroyuki was a refreshing change. She had to
admit that if she had a choice, she would rather hang out with him instead of
her classmates.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘Heck, who would want to do that with those mindless
boys and girls?’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> she mused.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I used to think that Lady Subaru’s feelings toward
Tsukasa would chance into friendship now that she knew that <i>‘he’</i> was a
girl in reality...” he paused and looked at his cup of black coffee, then
continued, “so I never expected her to....” He stopped and sighed, appearing
rather depressed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanae knew why. It wasn’t difficult at all, really, to
know what kind of feelings Kozuka Hiroyuki harbored toward his once liege lady
in The World. Personally, Kanae thought that although those bordered on the
romantic, they leaned more toward idolization and respect. The news that the
once leader of the Crimson Knights had found her happiness else where should be
hurting him a little bit... but the pain should go away soon. It wasn’t as
though the man was head over heels in love the way Mariko and An were anyways.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“But in any case, if what you said were true...”
Hiroyuki said after a while.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It is true,” Kanae interjected.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“If what you said were true,” the
twenty-three-year-old repeated, his dark eyes twinkling. Sometimes Kanae was
under the impression that the man liked to poke fun at her both out of meanness
and amusement. She suspected that the former was his main motivation, though.
But oh well, it wasn’t as though she didn’t give him hell during the last two
weeks with her cruel taunts and jokes. “Then Lady Subaru is in a tight spot
right now.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Right.” She nodded. “Seems to me that her mom’s
serious about the whole business.” Today was Madoka’s last day at work.
According to what Mariko told her on the phone earlier this morning, Madoka was
going there to submit her resignation letter and bring her belongings home.
Technically she didn’t have to do that until the day before she boarded the
plan with her daughter, but she did it nevertheless. Mariko said her mom
claimed that she wanted to have enough time to prepare for the upcoming trip.
Kanae knew better than that. The office lady only stayed home because she
needed to check on her daughter and made sure that Shouji An wouldn’t have a
chance to get near her girlfriend, that was it. Misono Madoka was determined to
destroy her daughter’s happiness, it would seem.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">However, for all her tenacity, Misono Madoka made one
mistake. When she went to work this morning, she had entrusted Mariko to her
old friend Inoue Ritsuko, owner of the Starbrooks Coffee Shop next door to the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanagawa Place</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">

building. If Madoka thought that in so doing, she could prevent Mariko and An
from seeing each other, she was dead wrong. As soon as she left, the shop owner
phoned the high school freshman and even arranged a small room in her shop so
that the lovebirds could spend quality time in private. If the Gods indeed
existed, this probably was their doing. Now if they would just brainwash
Mariko’s mother so that the woman could accept An, Kanae would seriously
consider paying a visit to her local Shinto shrine every weekend.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mitsuki,” Hiroyuki said suddenly. Despite the fact
that she had insisted him to call her Kanae, the man always addressed her with
her family name for some reason. After a while, Kanae gave up and let him call
her however he wanted.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m going to see Lady Subaru’s mom. Want to accompany
me?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanae blinked. “Why?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m going to talk her into accepting Lady Subaru’s
relationship,” he declared, his voice firm, his eyes determined.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well, I know you are eager to help but... what gave
you the notion that Misono Madoka is going to listen to a complete stranger?”
Kanae asked curiously.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Nothing.” The man shrugged. “I’m just more of a <i>“Do-it”</i>
kind of person. Rather than sitting here and pray, I like to take matters into
my own hands and deal with them. Besides, you’re her friend, Mitsuki. Do you
really want to stay on the sideline and watch Lady Subaru suffer?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No,” Kanae answered immediately.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Good, then come with me. We’re going to change
Misono-san’s mind.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Peering at the tall, lean man sitting opposite her,
Kanae couldn’t help but wonder as to where the man found his confidence. The
answer came to her in a flash. Of course, Kozuka Hiroyuki was terrifyingly
similar to Misono Madoka in some aspects. They both adored Misono Mariko. They
both tried to monopolize her, and in a way, they both attempted to <i>choose</i>

whom she should be acquainted with regardless of what she decided. If there was
one person in this world who understood Madoka, it would be none other than
Hiroyuki. That was why the man seemed so certain that he could persuade the
stubborn woman.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanae only prayed that they were going to succeed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Misono Madoka was sitting at her desk, the three sides
of which were walled by thick plastic screens that separated her from the rest
of her coworkers, and trying to finish her final share of paperwork when her
monitor flashed to life and displayed the dour, triangular face of a young
woman. Although she had no idea who this stranger was, she recognized the
background behind her back, though. It was, without a doubt, the wall behind
the reception desk on the lobby of the Hakusensha building. She walked past it
every day.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Misono-san, I presume?” the woman inquired, her voice
sourer than vinegar and barely more enjoyable than the sound of fingernails
scratching on a chalk board. Madoka could only wonder how such a person as
unfriendly as the one on the screen could be appointed a receptionist post. She
would most likely chase all the visitors away the moment she opened her mouth
and spoke. Compared to her, the lively young man who worked in the evening
shift, who always had a smile on his face as soon as he saw anybody, was much
more suitable for the job.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes,” she answered. “How may I help you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You have a visitor, ma’am. Shall I send him up to
your floor?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka frowned. Ever since she started working here,
she had never had a visitor. She had no living relatives, and her in-laws, an
old couple who didn’t want anything to do with her and her paraplegic daughter,
hadn’t given her a phone call or a letter in years. Who could it be? And why
did it have to be now, on the very day she handed in her resignation letter?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Did he give a name?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes.” The receptionist nodded. “He said his name was
Shouji Ichitaka. Plus, he claimed to be the father of a girl you know.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka’s hands tightened into fists. What in Heaven’s
name is Shouji An’s father doing in her workplace? Was it because of what
happened between the brat and Madoka yesterday? Did he come here to complain,
or beg for Madoka’s acceptance on his daughter’s behalf? Madoka surely wasn’t
going to give him a chance.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She was about to tell the receptionist to send the man
away when a different name popped up in her head and made all her movements
freeze. Shouji Ichitaka, she realized, was not what Shouji An’s current
guardian called himself. According to her daughter, the brat was living in the
care of a novelist named Sakuma Ryo, who adopted her to.... <i>‘Save her from
an abusive biological father,’</i> she finished mentally and very nearly gasped
aloud. She was offended by Shouji An’s very existence, but the maternal side of
her felt pretty much the same way about the fact that the girl had been
subjected to all sorts of verbal and physical violence by a beast clothed in a
man’s skin. What could that same beast, whom the court forbade to go near his
daughter, possibly want with Madoka?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Send him away! Now! Call the security if he refuses
to leave!” Madoka commanded, her stomach roiling with disgust.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The receptionist blinked in surprise. “Pardon me,
Misono-san, but the visitor also claimed that you would be interested in what
he had to offer. Oh, and he gave me a piece of paper and asked me to fax it
over. Will you accept it?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Her eyebrows knitting in confusion, Madoka stared at
her monitor for a full minute before she nodded and said in a dry voice, “Yes,
please.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Thirty seconds barely passed before her fax machine
spat out a sheet of paper filled with lines of characters written in a crude
and unruly penmanship. When she finished reading the thing, her heart was
pounding madly in her chest. Quickly rearranging the stuff on her desk, she
stood up, grabbed her coat, and walked hurriedly toward the elevator. The man
was right; Madoka was definitely interested in what he had to say. Shouji Ichitaka
just proposed to solve her dilemma, after all.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Shouji An was sitting on a small couch in a small and
scarcely furnished room, which the employees of Starbrooks Coffee Shop went in
during break time to relax before they continued working, which was empty right
now except for her and the young woman nestled in her arms, when her cell phone
decided to ring and disturbed their quiet time together. Grimacing in
irritation amidst Mariko’s melodious and crystalline laughter, An pulled out
the device from her coat pocket and attempted to turn it off. She only had a
little less than four hours to spend with her girlfriend before Madoka returned
and brought her home, so she really couldn’t afford any kind of distraction
now. Before she could press on the power key of the phone, however, her eyes
fell upon the LCD screen and found a set of numbers that she was intimately
familiar with. A lump of something rose in her throat and nearly suffocated
her.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Staring at the small screen the way a fox would a
hunter’s rifle, ears not exactly registering the ring tone, An felt herself
reeling into the realm of her memories, back to her life’s darkest days, which
was triggered by her mom’s death. Her reverie was so strong, so engrossing, and
at the same time so terrifying that only a few minutes after the phone had
stopped ringing could An snap out of it and found her arms trembling slightly
around the woman she loved.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Is there something wrong, An?” Mariko asked.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Before An could answer, though, her wireless rang one
more time and then went silent, indicating that a message for her has arrived.
Truth be told, the only thing she wanted to do at that moment was to throw the
phone into the trash basket and pretended the thing never existed... yet her
gut was telling her that there was a reason why that message was sent to her,
and that unless she opened it, she would regret it for the rest of her life.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She decided to be brave and view the message.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">When she was done reading the words, she felt as if
life had been sucked out of her. Her whole body went cold.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An, you looked so pale,” her girlfriend said
worriedly. “What happened?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Nothing much,” she answered. “A friend left a message
and told me to call her back. She wanted to ask me a few questions about the
homework we’re going to turn in tomorrow.” She had no clue how she could sound
so calm, how her voice didn’t tremble, and how her body wasn’t shaking, while
fear surged violently along her every nerve. She only hoped that her face
didn’t belie her true emotions. It would not do for Mariko to realize that An
was lying. It would not do for Mariko to know what was going on.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah,” Mariko said, suspicion evident on her face.
Still, she only fell silent afterwards, her amber eyes intent on An as though
urging her to tell the young woman the truth.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I... I’m going to call my friend,” An muttered
uneasily. “I’ll be back in a bit.” She carefully untangled herself from her
sweetheart and put the latter onto the sofa. Then she stood up and walked
toward the door to the room. Before she could leave, though, a strange feeling
rose in her heart and forced her to take one look at the blue-haired woman, who
was gazing worriedly and longingly at her. An walked back to her girlfriend,
placed a soft kiss on her lips, spun on her heels, and walked hurriedly out of
the room.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Treading along the small, empty hallway leading
toward the backdoor of the coffee shop, An wondered fleetingly whether she
would be able to see Mariko ever again.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Misono-san isn’t here?” Kozuka Hiroyuki blinked at
the grim-faced woman sitting at the humongous reception desk in the lobby of
the Hakusensha building. “Did she go home?” Next to him, the fifteen-year-old
Mitsuki Kanae was standing very still, her eyes, which were glued at the
polished granite wall behind the receptionist back, telling him just how
disappointed... and relieved she was feeling at the moment. Of course, eager to
help Lady Subaru and her friend as she was, a teenager like her couldn’t help
but be daunted by the task of facing an adult who, apparently, didn’t care much
for reasons. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I don’t know,” answered the woman with the sour
voice. She seemed to be straining herself to remain civil to the two people
standing in front of her desk. Not that her attitude had been much better when
they first showed up, though. While normal receptionists would flash welcoming
smiles and gush out greetings at their guests, this one had simply raised an
eyebrow at him and Mitsuki before asking them in a
not-quite-polite-but-not<WBR>-exactly-rude-either tone whether they had any business
with Hakusensha.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Hiroyuki frowned. He terribly disliked those who
simply couldn’t do the job that they were expected to. While he was still the
Captain of the Knights in The World, he did everything in his power to enforce
discipline and make sure that such people were properly straightened up. He
suspected that unless the higher-ups of Hakusensha were a bunch of
incompetents, this woman was in for a rude awakening very soon.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">He sighed. Since the receptionist appeared to be quite
insistent on being uncooperative, he guessed there was nothing he could do.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Let’s go, Mitsuki,” he said to the fifteen-year-old.
“It’s better to come straight to Misono-san’s house.” Maybe he should call in
later to file a complaint against this unresponsive receptionist.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sure.” The dark-haired girl nodded. The grim-faced
woman seemed infinitely relieved.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Excuse me, young man,” a warm, friendly voice spoke
behind Hiroyuki. As he and his companion turned around, he found himself
looking down at a gray-haired lady who stood a head shorter than him. The
newcomer, whose elderly face brimmed with the same kindness that he used to see
on that of his late grandmother, was looking at him and Mitsuki both with a
smile on her lips. Her eyes and facial expression, surprisingly, reflected the
wisdom and clarity of a mind age hadn’t managed to touch.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes, ma’am?” Hiroyuki bowed to the elderly lady with
respect. Mitsuki Kanae did the same.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You were looking for Misono Madoka-san?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes.” Hiroyuki replied, his eyes finding the nametag
on the elderly lady’s Hakusensha uniform. It read Shimura Kikuko. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m her supervisor,” Shimura-san said. “I saw her
leave just about two hours ago. She left her belonging here, so I would say
that she hasn’t come home yet. Although...,” she gave her lips a thoughtful
tap, “it’s highly usually that she hasn’t returned from her one-hour-break yet.
Misono-san is a very hard worker, you see. We really regret her resigning
today, but she’s a mother, and she must do what she must for her daughter.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah,” Hiroyuki muttered noncommittally. Mitsuki Kanae,
however, was looking uneasy again. He wouldn’t blame her. In The World, she
might be a Heavy Blade who spat in the face of danger, but in the real world,
she was just a little girl.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Do you have urgent business with Misono-san?” Shimura
Kikuko-san looked at him and Mitsuki both.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> “We do.” Hiroyuki nodded. It was best that they find
Misono Madoka and talk to her now, when lady Subaru wasn’t nearby. He didn’t
want to discuss this matter at his former leader’s house lest they put her in a
tight spot. Being trapped between her friend and her family was by no means a
good thing.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Gotou-san,” the supervisor turned to the rude
receptionist, who was eyeing the former with great unease. Hiroyuki could guess
what the woman was thinking. Since Shimura-san knew that they were looking for
Misono Madoka, it was possible that she had been observing them all along. In
that case, she must have witnessed the receptionist’s behaviors.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How may I help you, Shimura-san?” the woman squeaked.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I believe that a man came for Misono-san, correct?”
The firmness in the supervisor’s voice, which wasn’t there when she spoke to
Hiroyuki, confirmed his suspicion. Yes, she saw everything alright. “What is
his name?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Shouji Ichitaka, ma’am,” the Gotou woman answered
hastily.   </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Shouji... Ichitaka?” Hiroyuki repeated, blinking.
“Shouji?” He looked a question at Mitsuki Kanae, whose body had gone deathly
still, whose face was as white as a sheet of paper. “What’s wrong, Mitsuki?” he
asked.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That’s... that’s the name of An’s dad!” she said,
horror stark in her voice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It took him one full minute before he could recall
what kind of lowlife Tsukasa’s father was. His fists clenched. What in
goodness’s name could that man want with Misono Madoka? </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We’re leaving,” he told his companion.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What is the matter, young man?” Shimura-san said, her
eyes regarding him curiously.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Nothing, ma’am,” he replied quickly. “Thank you for
all your help.” Then he grabbed his young companion by the wrist and dragged
her out of the Hakusensha building.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">When they got to the nearest empty alley, Hiroyuki let
go of Kanae and commanded, “Call Lady Subaru, right now. Tell her to phone her
mom and ask where she is.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay.” Hand trembling, the fifteen-year-old took out
her wireless and punched the dials. Ten seconds later, she began to speak
hurriedly, “Mariko? Hey, I have a favor to ask. Will you...? Eh, why do you ask
me where An is? I thought she’s been by your side since the morning.” She
paused, face growing paler by the minute. “She left... without telling you an
hour ago and... hasn’t come back or answered the phone? Even <i>Satou-san</i>
didn’t see her leaving?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A horrible feeling enveloped Hiroyuki’s heart and
froze his internal organs. According to what Mitsuki Kanae had been telling him
about Tsukasa and Lady Subaru, they were inseparable when they were together.
If the Wavemaster suddenly snuck away in such a stealthy manner that their <i>bodyguard</i>
didn’t even notice... there had to be something wrong. And besides, he had a
feeling it was no coincidence that Tsukasa went missing at the same time Misono
Madoka did. Every fiber of his existence rang in alarm. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Calm down, Mariko, I’m sure there’s nothing wrong
with her,” Kanae said. She didn’t sound sure at all. “I said calm down....” He
sighed. The girl was in no position to tell other people to keep calm when she
herself appeared to be on the verge of panic. This surely was going nowhere, he
thought.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sorry, Mitsuki,” Hiroyuki muttered as he snatched the
phone from the junior high school student. “Lady Subaru? It’s me, Silver
Knight,” he said into the device.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There was a moment of silence on the phone. “Silver
Knight? You know Kanae offline?” She sounded shocked. He flashed his companion
a look. Apparently the girl never told Lady Subaru that they had started
hanging out with each other two weeks ago. To his surprise, the girl looked
away, seemingly mightily embarrassed and muttering something under her breath.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That’s not important at the moment, Lady Subaru,” he
said. “Please, be quiet listen to what I have to say.” He didn’t like giving
orders to the person who once commanded the whole Guild of Crimson Knights...
but in this situation, in which the disappearance of her lover had taken away
her composure, he had to overstep his bounds and take charge.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay,” Lady Subaru’s voice answered.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mitsuki mentioned in passing once that the phone
Tsukasa’s carrying has a GPS device, right?” Kanae pounded a fist upon her
palm.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes.” Kanae’s phone didn’t allow real-time video
transmission, yet Hiroyuki knew that his former leader had to be looking the
very same way the fifteen-year-old was at the moment. Under normal
circumstances, he was sure that Lady Subaru would have remembered that locating
the missing Wavemaster would be a piece of cake.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well then, I’m going to hang up now. After I do, I’d
like you to first call An’s adoptive father and tell him to look for Tsukasa.
Oh, another thing, would you tell me your mother’s phone number? I would like
to talk to her,” he added in the end as if an afterthought. His voice was
perfectly guarded and neutral, so he didn’t think that Lady Subaru would
suspect that something wrong had happened to Misono Madoka.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Is it about me and An?” the former Guild Master of
the Crimson Knights asked quietly. “I thank you for your concern, but you don’t
have to do that, Silver Knight.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Please, allow me to do something for you, my Lady,”
he insisted.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Another moment of silence came, then when Lady
Subaru’s voice returned, she told him her mother’s number. After that, he hung
up.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why didn’t you tell her the truth?” Kanae asked, her
dark eyes riveting on him.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She doesn’t need to know until we’ve learned where
her mom is,” he replied. “For all we know, Misono-san could be in her workplace
right now.” The last thing they wanted to do was scaring Lady Subaru even more
by telling her that her mom had gone off with a shady characters like Shouji
Ichitaka.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You know what, you’re awfully calm, Hiroyuki,” Kanae
said as she eyed him up and down as though she was seeing him for the first
time in her life. “Very reliable, too.” A smile crossed her lips.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Not knowing what to say to that, he gave back her
phone, took out his own, and dialed Misono Madoka’s phone numbers. When he hung
up after the fifth redial, he saw in the fifteen-year-old’s eyes the fear that

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Misono Madoka was sitting stiffly on a wooden chair,
her hands tied by a rope behind her back, and feeling incredibly stupid beneath
the tall roof of a large but empty warehouse. During the last ten years of her
life, she constantly found herself weighing her every decision very thoroughly
and carefully, as she knew that one wrong step would lead her and her dear
daughter to their undoing. Yet, for the first time since her husband’s death,
she succumbed to a terrible folly that landed her right into the middle of a
trap. Most ironic of all, she would have realized that she was walking into one
had it not been for her hatred against Shouji An and her insecurity as to her
daughter’s future. She didn’t know how Shouji Ichitaka learned of it... but the
man was undoubtedly aware of her weakness, of which he had successfully taken
advantage. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka scowled darkly at the unshaven man standing
just a few feet away from her chair, his eyes glued at the entrance to the
warehouse, his foot tapping impatiently on the ground. He looked every inch a
thug.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Shame on you, Misono Madoka, to have been deceived by
such a man,” she muttered under her breath.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Despite having warned Shouji An to stay away from her
daughter, Madoka knew better than anyone that hers was an empty threat. Also,
she realized that her control on her daughter’s life was being weakened by the
fact that in less than two weeks, they were going to fly to the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">U.S.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> and begin
Mariko’s treatment. Since the success rate was miraculously high, Madoka was
sure that when they returned to </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Japan</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> a year later, her daughter would have already
regained the ability to walk. And once that happened... Mariko could do as she
wished and toss all Madoka’s advices out of the window. Of course, her daughter
had always been a sweet kid who listened to and obeyed whatever Madoka said...
but who knew what a young woman would do for love? What Madoka had planned to
accomplish during the one year they were going to spend in </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">California</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> was
trying to make her daughter forget about Shouji An. She had hoped to find the
girl an upstanding Japanese husband there, too.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Yet, she had an inkling that she wasn’t going to
succeed. Perhaps that was because she knew how faithful and passionate her
daughter was. If the one she truly loved was indeed Shouji An, it wouldn’t
matter how long she had to wait, she wasn’t going to stop loving the damned
brat and fall for someone else. It was the sole reason why Shouji Ichitaka’s
words were so tempting... why his offer was so appealing... and why Madoka had
jumped head first down the cliff without so much as a second thought. She was
desperate. She had hoped to believe that the man could get rid of her burden.
And she was wrong.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The first thing that Shouji Ichitaka had done after
meeting her in the Hakusensha Cafeteria was telling her that they couldn’t
possibly talk in such a crowded place and suggesting that they went out to
another one that was more... private. In her desperate state, she had agreed
without a second thought. When they arrived at an empty alley near her
workplace just about five minutes later, Shouji chopped the edge of his large
hand against the nape of her neck and knocked her unconscious. Even now, after
the Gods only knew how long, it still hurt. Looking back, she couldn’t help but
curse herself yet again for being careless. She knew the man who had come for
her was a rotten human being... yet she had dumped all caution down the drain
as soon as she thought he could solve her problem.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">He couldn’t, she realized. Not with what he had in
mind. It was a doomed plan to begin with.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She’s not coming,” Madoka said suddenly. “Don’t
bother waiting.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh?” Shouji Ichitaka turned to her, a sneer twisting
his lips. “I beg to differ.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why do you think your daughter would do as you want
just because you abducted me? I hate her, and she hates me. She’s jump up and
down in joy the moment I die. Give it up and....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Let you go?” Shouji broke in. “No chance in hell.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why not?” she argued. “What’s the point of keeping me
here when you know that I’m useless to you? If you release me, on the other
hand, you can get out of this mess. I will even promise not to tell anybody
about this and pretend it never happened.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I keep you here because you will serve my purpose,
woman.”  The man snickered. “The brat will come, I know it.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How many times do I have to explain to you before you
see that...?” Madoka said in exasperation.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh don’t waste your breath,” Shouji Ichitaka cut in
again. “I’m fully aware of the hostility between you two. And I don’t doubt
that she hates you as much as you hate her. But you don’t know my daughter,
woman. I do.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What do you mean?” she demanded.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She’s the type that will do anything for the one she
loves,” he said. “And that’s not going to change, ever. I’ll let you know
something about An. You see, I have always hated that brat since the day she
was born. I tortured her anytime I wanted to, yet she never fought back. The
brat simply sat there and took the blows almost <i>meekly</i>. Heck, she didn’t
even talk back to me even once. Another kid would have tried to run away or
maybe planned to <i>kill</i> me. But she <i>didn’t</i>. Can you guess why?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka fell silent at the question.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It was because of her mother!” Shouji laughed. “The
brat loved her mother to the point of worship, and the woman loved <i>me</i>.
Do you see the parallel, Misono Madoka?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She did. She didn’t want to, but she did. And it
turned her stomach upside down.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Same thing here,” he continued. “Whether you refuse
to see it or not, the brat loves your daughter. And for that, she’ll do
anything to keep <i>you</i> alive. She’ll come here, I can bet my life on it.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What do you plan to do with her and me?” Madoka
asked, trembling.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Her? Well, I guess there’s no harm in telling you.”
Malice flashed in his eyes. “I’ll ship her to CC Corp. and let them turn her
into a lab rat. As for you...” those eyes fell on her, sharp and harsh, “I’ll
kill you and dump your corpse in the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Tokyo</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">River</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Her heart stopped beating as she stared at him in
fright.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What? Do you really expect me to let you live and
expose me to the police? Don’t be naïve.” The man drew from his trousers’
pocket a thin object that was half a hand in length. As he pushed his finger on
a button near one end, a small, gleaming blade swung out with a dry click. Even
at a distance, Madoka could still see that the thing’s edges were very sharp.
Cold sweat trickled down her back. “But hey, don’t worry. I’ll make it as
painless as I can, I promise.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Let her go, dad,” Shouji An’s voice said briskly and made
the man spin on his heel. The girl was standing at the entrance of the
warehouse with a sweat-drenched face. She appeared to have run hard. “Don’t
drag other people into our family affair.” Madoka didn’t know whether she
should feel relieved... or ashamed at the younger Shouji’s appearance.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“And what makes you think you can give me orders,
brat?” Shouji Ichitaka said menacingly, his knife turning in his hand and
catching the light of the late </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">noon</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> sun pouring in from behind An’s back.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Because you need me to sign something, don’t you?”
the brown-haired girl said in resignation.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How did you know that?” the man eyed at his daughter
suspiciously.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I heard you mention CC Corp,” the girl replied.
“Doesn’t take a genius to figure out that you must have been under that
Minamoto woman’s order. There’s only one thing that she wants from me.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sharp, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Let Misono-san go, and I’ll sign that contract for
you.” Madoka blinked. What Shouji Ichitaka told her earlier about his daughter
seemed to be the truth. Shame overwhelmed relief. Could it be that Shouji An
loved Madoka’s daughter so much that she was willing to become a lab rat to
save a woman who had insulted her, slapped her, and tried to separate her from
the one she loved? She found her relief suffocated by shame.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why should I?” The man smirked dangerously.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Because it’ll do you no good.” Deep blue eyes
regarded the sharp blade calmly. “Think about it, dad. If she dies, the police
will trace her death back to you sooner or later. Minamoto Iriya won’t protect
you.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The knife turned in the elder Shouji’s hand again,
only this time, it went much more slowly. The man, eyebrows burrowed together,
lips compressed to a thin line, seemed to have been taken aback by his
daughter’s boldness. Madoka wasn’t surprised that he did. After all, according
to what he told her just a bit ago, Shouji An <i>never</i> talked back.
Obviously, nor did she make any sort of counter-demands when being threatened.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“On the other hand, you’ll be free of the burden if
you release her,” Shouji An continued. “It’s not like the cops would believe
her if she came to them. Not if I signed the contract willingly.” The girl
turned to look at Madoka, her deep blue eyes tinged by sadness. “Besides, you
know how she feels toward me, don’t you, dad? I doubt she’s going to do
something like that for the one she hates.” Blood rushed to Madoka’s face. The
teenager’s words weren’t too far off the mark.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re right,” Shouji Ichitaka said finally. He
pulled from his pocket a folded piece of paper and tossed it at his daughter’s
feet. “Sign it, and I’ll let her go.” Madoka’s heart leapt up her throat.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sighing, Shouji An fell down on one knee and unfolded
the piece of paper quietly. Madoka opened her mouth... and then closed it
firmly when she realized that she didn’t know what to say.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Done,” An muttered once she had printed her personal
seal at the bottom of the contract. “Now, uphold your end of the bargain, dad.”
The only emotion that Madoka could sense in the seventeen-year-old’s voice was
resignation. The only emotion that she could feel in her own heart was shame.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Not saying a word, Shouji Ichitaka cut the ropes tying
Madoka’s wrists, grabbed her collar, and roughly pulled her to her feet. Pain
fastened around her neck and butterflies swarmed her vision.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I don’t think I’ll ever find out what mom saw in you,
dad,” she heard Shouji An comment in a dark, disapproving tone.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The elder Shouji scoffed at his daughter’s remark and
turned his attention on Madoka. “You’re lucky, woman. Now get out of my sight.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Trembling, Madoka walked slowly toward the entrance.
When she reached it, Shouji An stepped aside to let her through.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Please, tell Mariko I’m sorry,” was what the girl
whispered before Shouji Ichitaka roughly, pulled his daughter inside, pushed
Madoka outside, and slammed the doors shut. She didn’t believe she could ever
forget the tears that were silently falling down the brown-haired girl’s cheeks
and the look of unspeakable agony that stained her deep blue eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Now what are you going to do, dad?” Shouji An asked
quietly as she studied her biological father, whose attention was on the sheet
of paper that he had yanked from her hand. Never in her life did she see him so
happy. Never in her life did he disgust her more. To think that he would sink to
this level. To think that he was willing to sell his own daughter to a company
he knew would turn her into a lab rat. Yet, despising him as she was, she could
hardly pay him more attention. Her heart right now was only occupied by regret
and pain. Although she no longer cared what was going to happen to her, she
sensed her heart clench when she thought of Misono Mariko, the woman who had
proposed to her and promised to stay by her side until death tore them apart. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Ichitaka lifted his eyes from the contract, folded it
over, pushed it into his pocket, and said coldly, “I’m going to deliver you to
Minamoto.” He grabbed her by the wrist. Ignoring the tears soaking her cheeks
and the jolt of pain caused by her father’s iron grip, she let herself be
dragged toward a rusty metal door at the far end of the warehouse, which
creaked open at a push to reveal a small cargo truck parked just a few feet
away.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘So that’s what he’s going to use to ship me off to CC
Corp,’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> she thought. Images of Mariko
flashed again in her head. Her adoptive father had told her that the victims to
the Revolutionists’ experiments only suffered a short comatose and a long
period of muscle disablement... yet An doubted those things would be all that
would happen to her. She could only wonder if she was still alive one year from
now, when her sweetheart returned from the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">United
  States</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">. She hoped she was.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Get in,” Shouji Ichitaka growled. The man was
standing at the rear of the truck, his hand holding the door to the cargo
compartment. There was nothing inside. A lump rose in her throat. It was surely
going to be one dark and bumpy ride. Since her biological father seemed more
than eager to deliver his shipment, he was definitely going to drive as fast as
he could. And that... ought to get An’s stomach rolling during the trip.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Where are we going?” she demanded.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You don’t need to know,” the man answered harshly. <i>‘He
never changed,’</i> she thought. His eyes still glowed with murderous intent
whenever he looked at her. had it not been for the fact that he needed her
alive for Minamoto Iriya’s sake, he would have strangled her long since. Not
that he hadn’t tried to do that when she was still living with him... of
course. Her hand rose to touch her throat. It had been several years at
least... yet she wasn’t going to forget the day he nearly killed her in his
drunken state. The Gods must have tried to protect her that day... for the man
suddenly tripped on an empty beer bottle, banged his head against the wall, and
was knocked unconscious.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Fine,” An muttered and climbed inside the
compartment. It was cold, and fright was all she felt as the darkness around
her intensified and solidified, as the waning sunlight withdrew from the
narrowing opening of the closing doors. Feeling like a grape about to face the
winepress, she fell to her knees and readied herself to be embraced by the
darkness.</span></p>

compartment just a spit second before the doors could close down completely.
Then they stopped. Surprised, she crawled a bit closer to the thin opening and
peered outside. Then she gasped.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Down on the ground was Shouji Ichitaka, who was lying
unconscious on his stomach. Towering over him was the trembling figure of...
Misono Madoka, who was holding a thick length of wood in her hands. The woman,
panting heavily, was looking at An’s biological father as though wondering
whether she should whap his again just in case. Apparently she decided against
it, because she tossed the thing away. She still eyed the man lying at her feet
uneasily, though. If An didn’t know better, she would have thought the
middle-aged office lady was looking at a snake poising to strike.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Misono-san...” An said slowly as she got out of the
compartment. Not that she ever expected someone to come to her rescue... but
even if she did, she would never thought that someone would be Misono Madoka,
the person whose freedom An just traded with her own.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Not answering her, Mariko’s mother bent down and
searched Ichitaka’s trouser pocket. A second later, she pulled out her hand
along with the contract, which she tore into pieces while her mouth twisted in
disgust.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Misono-san... why....” She found herself unable to
continue due to the shock and amazement she was feeling inside.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Don’t read too much into it,” Madoka snapped,
appearing no friendlier that she was before. “I just hate this bastard too much
to let him get away unpunished.” Those amber eyes, blazing like fire in the
light of the late </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">noon</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> sun, rounded on An. “And I don’t want to owe you any
favor. Nothing has changed between us, you got that?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah, okay,” An said uneasily and stepped one step
backward. She didn’t doubt for one second that Misono Madoka meant every word
she said. “Uh, anyway, we should get out of here and call the cops.... LOOK
OUT!” An screamed at the same time she lunged forward and hurled herself at her
girlfriend’s mother.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

Shouji An’s body crashing against hers and knocked it to the ground.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What in Heaven’s name are you trying to do, Shouji?!”
she snarled at the girl who was lying on top of her. Strangely enough, the only
response she got from the brat was a soft but painful cry. Looking more
carefully, she found her breath caught at the sight of the blood that was
flowing out from a wide gash on the seventeen-year-old’s waist.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How dare you do that to me, damn woman?” bellowed
Shouji Ichitaka, who stood above them, eyes red with murder, hand clutching a
bloody knife. In an instant, she got it. The despicable man must have regained
consciousness while she was talking to his daughter. And he must have tried to
murder her for having spoiled his plan. Of course, he would have succeeded
without Shouji An pushing her out of the way and ending up struck by her own
father instead.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Horror rose in her as she stared transfixed at the
blood dying her own clothes red.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why do you have to do so much for me...
Shouji-san...?” she asked with a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Because Mariko... will be very sad... if something
happened to you...” the girl murmured weakly before she fell unconscious.
Madoka felt tears welling in her eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’ll kill you both!” Shouji Ichitaka roared in his
mindless rage and raised his knife overhead. Frightened to death, Madoka could
only look at the sharp blade that was approaching, ready to plunge into her
heart.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Freeze!” someone shouted in the distance and stopped
Shouji Ichitaka in his track.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Turning her head, Madoka saw a crowd of people running
toward them. Many of them wore the uniforms of the Tokyo Police Department. At
least five of them were holding guns in their hands.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Damn it!” Shouji Ichitaka cursed loudly before he
climbed hastily into the truck and sped away.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An! An!” A middle-aged man, whose build was tall and
wide, knelt down next to Madoka and gingerly examined the seventeen-year-old.
“Someone calls the ambulance! Hurry!” he cried afterwards in agony. He sounded
as though he was the one who was hurt.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Is An okay, Ryo-san?” a teenage girl, who was
accompanied by a young man, asked in a shaky and tearful voice as the policemen
around her either screamed into their walkie-talkies for an ambulance or
directed other people to give chase to the truck.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Suddenly, Madoka’s brain registered the name. Ryo.
This man had to be Sakuma Ryo, Shouji An’s adoptive father.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I don’t know, Kanae,” replied the man gravely as he
took the unconscious seventeen-year-old off Madoka and laid her on the ground
the way he would a fragile egg. Then he ripped his outer shirt into pieces and
tried to hold the blood in. He didn’t seem to be succeeding. “If the ambulance
doesn’t get here on time... An may just die from severe blood loss.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Hearing that, Madoka felt her self-restraint shatter.
She buried her face into her hands and wailed as much as she did the day her
husband died. It was all her fault that everything had to come to this. Had it
not been for her stubbornness and homophobia, Shouji Ichitaka wouldn’t have
found his own daughter’s weakness and manipulated it for his own again. Had it
not been for her, Shouji An would have never been hurt. If the girl died,
Madoka would regret it forever... and her daughter would hate her for the rest
of her life.</span></p>

his cell phone after the second ring. To his left, the calm surface of the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Tokyo</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">River</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> gleamed
like a mirror in the light of the setting sun. To his right, trees and tall
buildings raced backwards more and more rapidly as he pressed the gas pedal as
hard as he could. He had to find a way to get out of here. And Minamoto Iriya
might just know how.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Shouji-san?” the voice of the woman spoke calmly.</span></p>

sigh of relief. “Please, save me. The police are on my tail and....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Save you?” Iriya coldly cut him off. “You must be

everything,” said the CC Corp. woman. “I never told you to hurt anyone, and you
just had to go and wound An.” Her voice grew more heated with every word she
spoke. “You landed yourself into this predicament, so get out of it on your
own.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You can’t do this to me!” he roared into the speaker.
“I did everything for your sake!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No, sir, you did everything for your own sake,”
replied Iriya.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Listen, woman,” he snarled. “If you don’t get me out
of this trouble, you can be sure that the police will learn about you and your
company’s involvement.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“They cannot do anything to me, I assure you.” If the
woman wasn’t smiling on the other side of the line, Ichitaka would eat his
boots. “They have no proof.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I am the proof!”</span></i></p>

cold that it sent shivers slithering down his spine. He trembled. “I think I
know just the perfect way to silence you.” The safety locks on the truck
suddenly clicked into place as the glass windows rose up and blocked every
exit. Fear wrecked his body apart.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re trying to kill me!” he cried, switching his
foot onto the break pedal and tried to slow the vehicle down. To his shock, the
thing only sped up.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Not <i>trying</i>,” replied Minamoto Iriya. “This is
goodbye, Shouji-san.” She hung up.</span></p>

away from her laptop and leaned back against her chair, one of her hand raking
her hair, the other one clutching her forehead. Another failure. Now what
should she say to her comrades in the organization, who had been looking
forward to her victorious return? Gosh, but worse of all, Shouji An, the key to
dealing with the disobedience of the Morpheus System, the collection of
Morgana’s fragments, was going to die unless she was taken to the hospital on
time. And if she drew her last breath.... Iriya shivered. The dream of the
Revolutionist might never be fulfilled.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Minamoto Iriya,” a strange voice echoed in the room
and startled her. “So you are hiding in the Grand Central hotel. Very brave of
you indeed.” She gave a second start when she realized that the voice was
coming from the speakers of her laptop, the screen of which had gone pitch
black.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Who are you?” she demanded.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I am Helba,” the voice answered. “I’m sure you have
heard my name.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Iriya had. Helba was the famous hacker who had sided
with Kite and his companions in the war against Morgana. She drew a sharp
breath and thought that all her internal organs were turning into ice. How long
had this hacker been on her tail? And how did she find Iriya?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I have been trying to track you down for a while
now,” Helba continued. “You Revolutionists have been very careful in erasing
your traces. But, I finally caught you.” The woman’s voice took on a sharp but
satisfied edge.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What do you want?” Iriya tried to be calm and
addressed the threat in a rational manner. She barely succeeded.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Eliminating a threat to The World and its Players,”
Helba announced, “which means you and your petty organization. That is all I’m
interested in.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Despite her fear, Iriya laughed. “You are just a
little hacker. What gives you the notion that you can harm a hair on our head?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Your computer isn’t the only one that I’ve managed to
hack into,” the hacker said. “I will have you know that the mainframe at your
headquarters shared the same fate.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re lying!” Iriya suddenly found it excruciatingly
hard to breath. It had to be a bluff. It <i>had</i> to be! They had the most
talented computer scientists working for them at headquarters. She refused to
believe that one hacker could infiltrate into their digital fortress!</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You shouldn’t be so sure,” Helba said, her voice
racked with amusement. “Why don’t you call them up and ask how they are doing?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Iriya never hesitated before she pulled out her cell
phone and dialed headquarters’ numbers. Ten minutes passed as she waited for
someone to pick up the phone, redialed, waited, and then redialed again. The
result never changed. The dull ring tone was the only sound that answered her.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It can’t be,” she muttered in disbelief as she let go
of her cell phone and see device crack open on the floor. At headquarters,
there was always someone waiting to answer calls from her. The fact that none
did, meant that... perhaps what the hacker said was the truth. Shivering, she
turned her attention back to her traitorous laptop.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“They are all in the police custody right now, in case
you are wondering,” Helba said. “I’ve turned in all the secret documents I
downloaded from your mainframe to the Ministry of Cyber Regulations just a few
hours ago. You wouldn’t believe how quickly they acted, really. I guess they
have been waiting for an excuse to lay their hands on CyberConnect for a long
time.” The woman stopped to laugh. “The larger a tree is, the more winds it
catches, don’t you agree?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh, and by the way, I’ve recorded your conversation
with Shouji Ichitaka before he died. You can be sure that it will be used as
evidence against you in your trial.” Her voice hardened. “I never expected you
to kill him, though, so I couldn’t react fast enough to save him. I would have
liked it much better had he served the rest of his natural life in prison
instead.” Suddenly, her voice softened to almost a whisper, “This is goodbye,
Minamoto Iriya.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Silence followed while the screen of her laptop brightened
into life again. After a full minute of sitting in her chair in a daze, she
sprang up to her feet and gathered her belonging. Before she could stuff
everything into her suitcase, however, the door to her room was blasted open.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Minamoto Iriya, I presume?” A burly man in a dark
blue suit stepped inside, his hand holding a police badge. “I am Captain Kuroda
from the Tokyo Police Department. You’re wanted by the Ministry of Cyber
Regulations. I now place you under arrest. Be aware that anything you say from

in a white room with white curtains stirring gently in the night winds. Outside
her window, the full moon was shining amid a starry sky. Inside, there was her
girlfriend, a being that was just as dazzling, sitting on her wheelchair by the
bed, her hands holding An’s left very tightly. No one else was in the room.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Are you feeling okay, An?” Mariko said worriedly when
she noticed that An had woken up. That was when she noticed the moisture in her
girlfriend’s amber eyes. “Don’t move. Your wound is still tender. It may open
again.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m okay, I think,” she replied. Move? She didn’t
have enough strength to lift a finger.... “How long have I been unconscious?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“A few hours,” her sweetheart answered. “I was scared
to death, An. The doctor said that you lost so much blood you could have died.”
Her voice was shaking violently toward the end, and her hands held An’s more
tightly than ever. She seemed on the verge of tears, too.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry I worried you, Mariko,” An said, feeling
moisture gathering in her own eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m just glad you’re okay now, An,” the young woman
said. “And... thank you for protecting my mom even after all that she’s done to
you.” She leaned over and gave An a light kiss on the lips.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re welcome.” An felt herself blush. “Is she okay,
though?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She is.” Mariko nodded. “She’s sitting outside right
now, talking to Ryo-san.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An blinked. “My dad? About what?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I have no clue.” Her girlfriend gave her a rueful
smile. “Why don’t you ask him later? He may tell you. Oh, Kanae and Hiroyuki
are outside too. They were here went you were still sleeping, and they just
left to get some coffee. I think they intended to stay here until you woke.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hiroyuki?” An raised an eyebrow. “Who’s that?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah. That’s Silver Knight’s real name.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Silver Knight?” An repeated in amusement. What was
that rigid, inflexible former captain of the Crimson Knights doing here?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Apparently, he and Kanae had been meeting up
regularly behind our back.” Mariko winked at her. “I asked Kanae why she didn’t
tell us, and she said she was afraid that <i>I</i> would tease her. But I think
she likes him, whether she knows it or not.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An laughed softly at the revelation. To think that
Silver Knight and Kanae of all people would come together when they acted like
dogs and cats around each other in The World. She stopped and winced shortly
afterwards, though, as her laughter appeared to have excite her wound a little
bit.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Careful,” Mariko said as her hand gently stroke An’s
head.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay,” she murmured happily in response. Then
suddenly, a thought struck her. “You said your mom was outside?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Then... why did she let you stay in here with me?” An
said slowly. “I thought she....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You saved her life, my love,” the blue-haired woman
whispered. “Do you think she was so heartless that she would try to separate us
again? She was sorry that she treated you badly before, An. She told me that.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Then... then...” An stuttered, unable to believe what
her girlfriend just said, “she is okay... with me and you now?” Tears welled up
in her eyes again.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Of course,” Mariko replied gently. “It still makes
her a bit uneasy, I think, but she’s accepted you as my girlfriend. And that’s
all that matters, ne?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes. That’s all that matters. Thank goodness,” An
said, feeling hot tears rolling down her cheeks. Quietly, Mariko dabbed at them
with her sleeves. She would have kissed An again, too, had someone not knocked
softly on the door.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I heard you talking,” the voice of An’s adoptive
father said. “Has An woken up, Mariko?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes, come in, Ryo-san,” her sweetheart answered.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The door opened and admitted Sakuma Ryo, who was
grinning more brightly than ever before. An blinked. What made the man seem so
happy? Even Mariko was staring at him in surprise.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How are you feeling, kiddo?” Ryo said as he pulled
out a chair from nearby and sat down next to the bed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m okay. What about you, dad? Did you win a lottery
when I was sleeping or something?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Something like that.” The novelist nodded, his huge
grin unfaltering on his lips. “I have bad news and good news. Which one do you
want to hear first?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Bad news!” An and Mariko said at the same time.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Ryo looked at each of them in great amusement before
he nodded and said, “Well, you will have to stay here until tomorrow night for
further checkup. It means that you’ll need to ear the horrible hospital food
that they serve in here.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What kind of bad news is that?” An scoffed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You don’t have to worry about that, Ryo-san.” Mariko
gave the man a smile. “I’ll ask my mom to prepare food for An. I don’t think
she’ll refuse.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay then. Now for the good news. You are to stop
going to class in </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Japan</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> for one year, An.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Eh?” An frowned. “What do you mean I am to...?” She
stopped abruptly as what her father said hit her like a club. </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Japan</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">. One
year. Mariko took a deep breath, her eyes transfixed on Ryo’s face, which looked
like a child at his birthday party.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well, I didn’t say you could stop going to school per
se,” the novelist said, obviously enjoying himself. “You are, however, to
participate in a Student exchange program with a high school in </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">California</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“But... but how...? I thought you didn’t have the
money for me to go to the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">U.S.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">” An mumbled breathlessly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I didn’t. And still don’t. At least not yet.” Ryo
winked at both of them. “But a kind lady has agreed to let you go with Mariko
there by giving up her own spot. Can you guess whom?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“My... mom?” Mariko’s eyes were as wide as they could
be. And her mouth was hanging open. An, on the other hand, was at a loss for
words.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Apparently, you moved her greatly by saving her life,
An.” Her father smiled broadly. “She didn’t say that, mind you. I think she’d
die before she admits it. What she did say, however, was that she feared she
might not find a job one year later, when she came back from the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">U.S.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> That was
why she needed to stay in </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Tokyo</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> and kept working, was what she also claimed.” Ryo
rolled his eyes. “Oh, and she has a message for you. <i>‘If you don’t care for
my daughter properly when you’re in </i></span><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">California</span></i><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">, I’m going to skin you when you return.’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">” He laughed at that.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> When Mitsuki Kanae and the man named Hiroyuki came
into the room a few minutes later, they found An crying like a baby in Mariko’s
arms while her father was sitting uncomfortably on his chair. Between her sobs
and her tears, she thought that the wound she took in Misono Madoka’s stead was
worth it. If she had had to take a dozen more, it would still be worth it. The
Gods standing witness, she would hand over everything she ever owned just for
the possibility that she didn’t have to be separated from the one she loved.
Oh, how she had prayed every night for a miracle.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An never thought that she would get one. And
certainly, nor did she expect that such miracle would be handed to her by
someone who she thought would hate her until the end of time.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

left ajar, Misono Madoka silently listened to the sobbing sound echoing out
from inside. Even her own daughter was crying. Yet, the tears that she shed
were happy ones, and those were what convinced Madoka that her decision was
correct. She didn’t want to, couldn’t, admit it, but Mariko needed Shouji An
more than she needed Madoka. She sighed. Besides, although the
seventeen-year-old was still young and inexperienced, there was no doubt that
she would do everything in her power to keep Madoka’s daughter safe.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sighing again, she stepped away from the room. Now she
needed to call her supervisor and beg her to pretend that Madoka never handed
in a resignation letter. She hoped that she could cook up a reason good enough
to convince the elderly lady.</span></p>

said as she rose to her feet and tried to get a good look around their modest
apartment. Moving boxes were all around the places, and they had taken up so
much space that she found it rather hard to walk around. She only wished they
had paid a little bit more attention before they dumped everything into the
living room. “An?” The nineteen-year-old was nowhere to be seen. Mariko only
wondered where the girl went.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She walked to the bedroom and found her sweetheart
there, sitting on the bed with her cell phone propped against her ear. The
conversation, whoever it was with, was already over, though.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow, dad,” An said. “You take
care too. And don’t use the microwave too often, or I’ll throw the thing away
when I see it next. Bye.” She hung up.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Dad called?” Mariko murmured softly as she settled
down by her spouse’s side on the bed. Behind them, above the headboard, on the
wall was the picture of their wedding day. She got to admit, she never appeared
happier in her life. Although... she kinda wished that she didn’t wear her
wedding band to college. That way, her classmates would never have realized
that she was married. Those relentless people kept on teasing her and wanting
to meet An so that they could tease them both at the same time. It took a great
deal of effort just to fend them off.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes.” An nodded and put her head on Mariko’s shoulder
and her arm around Mariko’s waist. “He wanted to know if we needed any help.
You know, with us moving out and all.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“He could have called a few hours ago, when we were

out, had offered to help them financially so that they could have a house of
their own. They refused because they wanted to build everything with their own
hands. Besides, this was their sanctuary. It wasn’t right to borrow someone’s
money for that. It was indeed a good thing, though, that the novelist took no
offense and respected their wish. He was truly a good and understanding dad.
Her biological one was like that, too, before the accident robbed him from her
and her mother.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mariko, I learned something very interesting when I
was talking to dad just now.” An sounded terribly amused.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Can you guess who was it that got you the treatment
offer from the charity organization in the U.S?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Tell me. I’m bad at guessing games, An.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“B.T.!” The brown-haired girl giggled.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“For real?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes! It was a slip of the tongue on dad’s part.
Apparently, B.T. forbade him to tell us. Oh, she was also the person who gave
him the VIP passes to LaQua.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That sounds just like her.” Mariko smiled. Yes, it
was indeed B.T.-like to do a good deed without taking credit for it. She would
need to thank her later. Treating her to dinner, or lunch, someday, perhaps.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh, and before I forget. Mom called just before dad
did,” An announced. “She asked us to come over later tonight to have dinner
with her. She thought we’d be too busy to cook, so she would do that for us. I
accepted her invitation, by the way.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Good thing that you did.” Mariko laughed. “I’m too
tired to cook now.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Misono Madoka, Mariko and An’s beloved mother, was now
doing quite well in her career, too. Since her supervisor’s retirement about a
year ago, she had been appointed to hold the same post. With that, she now no
longer had to work nights and days for a meager monthly salary and had much
more time to do the things that she loved. Which, interestingly enough, involved
taking a night-time Flower arrangement class at Mariko’s college. Madoka seemed
to be having a lot of fun these days, so Mariko was very happy for her.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What time did she say we could come by?” she asked.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Around eight,” her sweetheart answered.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hmm, two more hours to go.” She eyed her sweetheart
mischievously. “What do you think we should do to pass the time?” Even as she
spoke, she gently lowered the nineteen-year-old to the soft mattress, which
happened to be Sakuma Ryo-san’s wedding gift, and pinned her hands on either
side of her head.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Um... go back to unpacking?” An swallowed. Her
breathing was uneven, and her face, under the fluorescent light tubes hanging
on the ceiling, was very red.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Bad idea,” Mariko said with a smile. She took one
hand away to use it to unbutton her lover’s collar shirt. She intentionally
drew her palm across the girl’s heaving chest, too, and elicited a soft cry
from her in the process.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I thought you were tired,” An whispered, her mouth
slightly opened as though inviting kisses.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Too tired <i>to cook</i>. That’s what I said.” Mariko
laughed softly into the crook of her sweetheart’s neck. The girl could only
whimper aloud. She fell quiet, though, as soon as Mariko claimed her lips and
gave her a kiss that seemed to burn herself inside out. Now that they had their
own place, their life as a couple truly began. This small apartment, their
sanctuary, their shelter, their home sweet home, where she and An were going to
spend the next stage of their life together, was where she and her heart
belonged. As long as An continued to love her and stay by her side, this world
would always remain her paradise.</span></p>
