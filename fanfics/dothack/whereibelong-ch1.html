<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Misono Madoka, thirty-seven-year old this July, was an
office lady who divided her daily hours between working on the fourth floor of
Hakusensha Publishing Incorporation and caring for her paraplegic daughter at
home. Her life, ever since a car accident killed her husband and crippled her
dear daughter Misono Mariko, was mostly dead. The only wish Madoka had now was
to see her Mariko be able to walk once more. She knew it was possible. Her
coworkers had informed her that beyond the sea, all the way in the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">United States</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">, there were people who could provide a cure to
Mariko’s condition. It was just that... Madoka could never afford the price for
her daughter’s full recovery with the meager monthly salary she received. She
went to the local Shinto shrine every weekend as a result, praying that the
Gods would let her win the lottery just so she could return to her daughter the
ability to walk. They didn’t seem to have heard her pleas.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sighing, Madoka washed the rest of the dishes and went
back to the bedroom of her apartment on the sixth floor of the twenty-story </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanagawa Place</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">. She would have preferred renting a small house for
herself and Mariko instead of this little 2DK, of course. With the child’s legs
disabled so, the closer to the ground she lived, the safer Madoka would feel
when she had to leave the house for work early every morning. The only problem
was, again, money. Madoka’s pitiful income wouldn’t allow her to live anywhere
else in </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Tokyo</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> except this cubbyhole of an apartment, which was
already ridiculously overpriced. Had her husband survived, the combined
financial abilities of the two of them could have given Mariko a much better
life.... Sometimes she couldn’t help but despair and wonder how the Gods could
have put a virtuous family like hers in such a tight spot.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In her bedroom, Madoka changed into an outfit suitable
for going out, briefly glancing at the mirror on the wardrobe. She was only
thirty-six this year... yet hour after hour of running back and forth between
her job and her home had but added a few years to her face, once pretty enough
to make any man turn his head and look. Sighing again and trying to forget the
thought about how her appearance had deteriorated over the years, she looked at
the clock on the table by her bed. It read </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">one fifteen</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> in the afternoon. The appointment at the hospital for
Mariko’s weekly checkup was at two, so she would have plenty of time left.
Madoka wondered if she should take the child to some fancy restaurant
afterwards for a change. Gods knew how long they had been forced to live on
canned food just because Madoka didn’t have the time to cook. She was such a
terrible mother at times.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Come in, mom,” said the gentle voice of Madoka’s
daughter when she knocked on the door to the child’s room.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Inside, on a wheelchair in front of the computer desk
sat Madoka’s daughter, Misono Mariko, in a simple white T-shirt, a blue coat,
and a pair of black jeans. The girl was on the phone. Madoka didn’t have to
guess to know the person to whom her daughter was talking. There could only be
one. “See you soon, <i>An</i>,” Mariko whispered into her mobile and hung up,
thus confirming Madoka’s suspicion. She sighed. <i>‘The brat again,’</i> Madoka
thought gloomily. She still couldn’t see what her daughter saw in someone with
such a questionable character and background like the girl named Shouji An. Or
maybe Madoka just disliked the girl too much to do that....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Shouji-san is coming over?” Madoka cleared her throat
and asked. Her daughter’s friend once insisted that she be called by her first
name. Madoka just refused to and gave no reason why she did. Although it made
the girl <i>and</i> Mariko look quite uncomfortable every single time, Madoka
didn’t really care.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes.” Mariko nodded, a little smile forming on her
lips. Twenty-year-old this February, with flowing blue hair that fell past her
shoulders and a face many girls would kill to have, Mariko always looked mature
and dignified, very much unlike the brat that appeared out of nowhere two
months ago, Madoka had noticed. She guessed she had raised her daughter well.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“But we are coming to the hospital for your checkup,”
Madoka reminded her daughter. “Why make her come here?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You forgot, mom?” Mariko gave her a puzzled look. “I
told you last night that I asked An to pick me up and take me to the hospital
today.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Did you?” Madoka asked absentmindedly, not really
expecting an answer, for she had a feeling her daughter was telling the truth.
When she came home around eight in the evening last night, she had been so
tired that she headed straight for bed without bothering to even change her
clothes. She must have heard Mariko mention it and then forgotten about it as
soon as her back landed on mattress of her bed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko wheeled forward and stopped in front of Madoka,
where the girl took Madoka’s right hand into both of hers. “You have been
working yourself very hard lately, mom,” she said softly. “Why don’t you take a
little break today and relax?” Concern all but shone in the child’s amber eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka placed her vacant hand on her daughter’s head
and stroked it gently, her very own overwhelmed with thoughts. She knew that
Mariko was very worried about her health, and that the child only wished her
well by asking someone else to bring her to the hospital instead.... Still, why
did Mariko <i>have</i> to pick <i>Shouji An</i> out of all the people she knew?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘What is so good about someone you had only met but a
few months ago, little one?’ </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka
thought. She couldn’t quite bring herself to ask her daughter that question
directly, though, as she was deathly frightened of the possibility that she
would receive an answer she couldn’t accept. She knew all too well what kind of
feelings her daughter harbored toward Shouji after all... maybe almost as well
as Mariko herself did.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Does Shouji-san know where the hospital is?” she
asked.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An doesn’t,” Mariko smiled as she let go of Madoka’s
hand, “but I know, don’t I? I can show her the way.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well then, I’ll go to the supermarket instead,”
Madoka said in resignation. “What do you want for dinner today, Mariko?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah, I’m sorry, mom,” the child murmured
apologetically. “An told me on the phone just now that her father invited me
for dinner over at their house. I’m going there after the checkup and won’t be
home until seven or so in the evening, I think.” Madoka’s hand, released by her
daughter just a moment ago, curled into a fist almost instinctively. Unable to
straighten it out, she hid it behind her back. Thankfully, the child didn’t
notice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I see,” was all she could force herself to say to her
paraplegic daughter. Silence stretched between them, with Madoka standing there
like a lamp post and not really knowing what else she should say, until the
door bell rang loudly and provided her with an escape.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I think that’s An.” A bright smile bloomed on
Mariko’s lips. “She was in the neighborhood when she called me on her cell
phone.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’ll answer the door,” Madoka told the child in a
half-hearted voice. Only very dimly did she notice that her daughter had given
her a very odd look before she walked out of the room.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Good afternoon, oba-san,” Shouji An greeted her
awkwardly the moment the door opened. In a casual shirt, a sweater, and a pair
of shorts that barely went past her knees, with short brown hair framing a face
that didn’t give out much sense of femininity, the girl would have been
mistaken for a boy without the curve of her chest. Even her voice was almost as
deep as that of a man, for crying out loud.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hello, Shouji-san,” Madoka said politely. Truth be
told, she never wanted to be called <i>“oba-san”</i> in such a familiar manner
by someone she disliked... but she didn’t know what her daughter would say
should she tell Shouji to stop addressing her as such. “Come on in,” she
invited, her voice somewhat stiff. The Gods knew Madoka still hadn’t been able
to cope with the fact that she was going to spend her Saturday all alone while
her daughter was gallivanting off and having fun with her... friend. It was
surely going to be a long day....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Um, here...” said the seventeen-year-old as she
handed Madoka a bouquet that was full of white lilies, the fragrance of which
was so strong she very nearly pulled away instead of taking it. “Please pardon
my intrusion,” Shouji murmured before she took off her Nike sneakers, put them
behind the doorstep, and finally went inside. When she walked past Madoka, she
couldn’t help but notice that the girl had grown a little bit taller. A few
months back, Madoka topped Shouji easily by half a head; now, they were of
equal heights. She but wondered if youngsters these days all grew up so
fast....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hi there,” said her daughter, who was smiling and
waving her hand at her friend. Somehow, Mariko had managed to follow Madoka all
the way to the door without her noticing. Well, she wasn’t paying much
attention to her surrounding she supposed....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Are you well, Mariko?” Shouji said as she knelt on
the wooden floor, right in front of Madoka’s daughter. The newcomer then took
Mariko’s hands into her own and squeezed them tenderly, the former’s deep blue
eyes locked with the latter’s amber, lips curving upward into a bright smile.
The way they looked at each other so affectionately, neither seemed to be able
to notice that Madoka was standing right there, her hands clutching the
bouquet.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Didn’t I tell you that I was well every time you
asked on the phone or in The World?” Mariko gave the girl three years her
junior a soft smile. She sounded very fond.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I couldn’t see you then.” Shouji An returned the
smile with one just as soft. “But I’m glad you’re healthy, Mariko. I’m sorry I
couldn’t come online much lately,” she said, her tone apologetic. “Life’s been
hectic with all the midterm exams.” She paused and continued, her voice
dropping so low Madoka almost didn’t hear what she said, “I missed you.” The
seventeen-year-old girl’s face was a little bit red.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I missed you, too,” replied Madoka’s daughter, her
shy voice equally quiet.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka almost snorted. Shouji An came over to visit
every weekend, and according to Mariko, they met frequently in an online game
they called <i>“The World”</i>. Why did they have to act as if it had been
years since they last saw each other... every single time?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Madoka cleared her throat. Each of the two girls gave
a start, finally realized that they were not alone, and took up a serious study
of the floor beneath their feet.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s one thirty already,” she reminded them. “You
should go.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah yes,” said Mariko and Shouji An in unison,
appearing more flustered than ever. Madoka believed both of them had forgotten
about her daughter’s doctor appointment... and maybe also the rest of the world
while they gazed into each other’s eyes. It wasn’t going to be long until that
which was inevitable happened. Yet even so... Madoka only hoped that day would
never come.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We’ll be going then, mom.” Mariko’s voice jerked
Madoka back to reality, where she noticed that the two girls had already gone
outside and were now looking at her. How long did she remain in a daze, really?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Have fun then, Mariko,” she paused, then added, “and
be careful.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Each of the girls gave Madoka an odd look before they
closed the door and left. Muttering darkly to herself, Madoka went back to her
room, sat down on the bed, and took the photo of her late husband, encased in a
glass frame, into her hands.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Kohei-san, I’m really lonely right now, do you know?”
Madoka whispered to the picture. “Ever since you passed away, I’ve been
spending all the time and effort I can spare into raising our daughter, hoping
she can find her happiness. Mariko’s all I have left in this world; although I
fear the day where she leaves me behind and moves on with her life, I wish from
the bottom of my heart that somehow she’d meet a man who’d love her, care for
her, and live happily by her side forever.” A tear leaked out of the corner of
her eye and rolled down her cheek. “Yet, I never imagined that our daughter
would fall in love with another girl like this.” She held the frame closer to
her heart and sobbed. “I don’t want her to walk down such a sinful path... but
I don’t want to hurt her either. What should I do now, Kohei-san?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry, An, what was that?” Misono Mariko, sitting
on her wheelchair guided by her young companion, asked when she realized that
her friend had said something she failed to catch. At the moment, they were
inside a park that happened to be on the way to the hospital. There were other
routes, of course, but Madoka would always pick this one despite the fact that
it would cost them an extra ten minutes. Mariko was thankful to her mother for
that, as she truly loved the cool shade provided by the trees in the park as
well as the luxuriously verdant color that enveloped everything in sight.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s... nothing,” replied the brown-haired girl, her
voice slightly apprehensive. When Mariko turned her head to look, she realized
that the face of the girl three years her junior was painted with unease.
Mariko didn’t really have to guess to know what was bothering the person who
had become more than just a part of her life.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry about what happened at my house,” Mariko
said quietly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Not that I’m complaining or anything but... your mom
doesn’t like me, does she?” An scratched her cheek and gave Mariko an apologetic
smile.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko fell silent. The answer to her friend’s
question was surely a “Yes”. Ever since her mom met An a few months back,
Mariko had realized immediately that the feelings Madoka harbored toward the
girl were less than amiable. Mariko just couldn’t understand why. True, An was
a slightly temperamental kid who sometimes would get depressed for apparently
no reason at all. Sure, her social and communication skills weren’t that good,
and she didn’t exactly feel comfortable around people at times, either, all
thanks to the terrible treatments she had received from her father since
childhood. But those were no reasons to dislike her, Mariko believed,
especially when respect was all with which An had treated Madoka. The latter
should have known that had she not been Mariko’s mother, all she could have
gotten from An was the indifferent attitude the girl assumed in front of nearly
everybody else.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko glanced at the brown-haired girl, who was
looking at her with a slightly saddened face, and felt her heart clench. There
was no one she liked more than An in this world, so she had wanted her mother,
the person whom she deeply cherished and to whom she was eternally grateful, to
get along with the girl, too. Yet, it turned out that reality rarely was bent
by one’s wish. She doubted the way Madoka felt about An was going to change any
time soon. How sad that the relationship between the two most important persons
in Mariko’s life had to turn out like this....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What do you think she disliked me for, though?” An
asked.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I... don’t know, An,” Mariko confessed. “I honestly
don’t. But please, don’t hate her, ne. Mom isn’t a bad person. Maybe she’s
just... just....” She trailed off, not really knowing what she should say to
defend Madoka.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The wheelchair pulled into a halt near a gushing
fountain. There were no other people nearby.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I don’t hate her,” said Shouji An, who had fallen
down on one knee in front of Mariko. The girl had taken Mariko’s right hand
into hers once more and held it against her own cheek. “No matter how she
treats me, I’m not going to hate her. So don’t you worry, Mariko.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That’s very nice of you, An.” Mariko gave her
companion a grateful smile, which made her blush. The girl’s coloring cheek was
very warm against Mariko’s palm.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Only because she’s your mother,” murmured the
seventeen-year-old. “I can’t care less about other people, you know that.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I can’t say I have no problem with that attitude of
yours,” Mariko gave a quiet chuckle that was part rueful and part amused. “But it’ll
do for now, I guess.” She cupped An’s face with both of her hands, lifted it
up, and gave the girl a light kiss on the lips. When Mariko pulled away, the
face of the brown-haired high school freshman had become so red it could easily
match the color of a ripe tomato. An was ever so shy. It wasn’t the first time
they kissed since their confession a couple of weeks ago... yet the girl never
had the courage to do more than just holding Mariko’s hand even when they were
in private. But the Gods standing witness, An’s innate bashfulness was one of
the aspects that made her seem so endearing in Mariko’s eyes.</span></p>

Mac Anu, the river that was the namesake of the Aqua Capital, when someone’s
hand was placed on her shoulder. Looking up, she saw the tall and wide figure
of the Heavyblade senior Bear, who was smiling indulgently at her like a kind
father would his favorite daughter. Mimiru couldn’t be sure that Bear, a
wealthy novelist in real life, didn’t see her as one, though. In fact, she had
reasons to believe that the middle-aged swordsman saw every newbie in The World
as his surrogate child... until they learned how to fend for themselves against
the monsters and the Player Killers, of course. Mimiru had never had the
courage to tell Bear this but... the man needed to learn that he shouldn’t
continue to feel so guilty toward his own son, whom he once neglected, that he
kept on looking for people to watch over in The World. Besides, he had Tsukasa
now, didn’t he?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Waiting for Godot again?” said Bear, who sat down
next to her.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No, I’m not.” Mimiru gave the newcomer a look. That
joke was getting pretty old, really.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Then why are you sitting here looking so bored?” </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Because I <i>am</i> bored,” Mimiru muttered. “I guess
there’s a limit to how long The World can keep my interest. Now with the whole
Key of the Twilight business over and Morgana gone for good, it’s just... too
peaceful around here, don’t you think?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I don’t think so.” The other Heavyblade laughed. “Ever
since the Crimson Knights were disbanded, Player Killers have been popping up
all over the place. Didn’t you read the BBS? The dungeons of Carmina Gadelica
are crawling with them.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I blame CC Corp. Administrators,” Mimiru said
disapprovingly. “They made this game. Shouldn’t they provide necessary measures
to counter people who violate the rules?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well, you see, there are all sorts of complications.
For one, they don’t have the resources to monitor all the dungeons and millions
of users worldwide,” the man explained. “The Crimson Knights, on the other
hand, had mobility, enthusiasm, and the trust of the users of The World.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well, maybe if a new group similar to the Knights
were founded....” She trailed off.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You noticed, didn’t you,” Bear gave her a knowing
smile. “There are very few people with leadership skills among us. The strong
PCs usually keep to themselves. The weak ones usually don’t have the
credibility. Subaru was the sole exception. From the very beginning she had the
support of Crim, who was powerful enough to rally people to his cause. When he
left, Subaru had already gained enough trust from the members to manage the
guild all on her own. Besides, she herself was a great leader. Her will is
strong, her heart true and kind. Not many PCs are like that.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Speaking of whom, where is she lately?” Mimiru
decided to change the topic. The conversation was getting a little bit too
political for her taste. “I haven’t met her in here for a while. Has she given
up on The World?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh she came in here quite often, don’t you know?” The
novelist gave her a puzzled look.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Never saw her!” Mimiru exclaimed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Bear shrugged. “Well, An, I mean Tsukasa, told me they
met regularly online during the evenings, once she had finished her classes
over in the boarding school....” It was the man’s turn to trail off as a look
of comprehension dawned on his tattooed angular face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It was but obvious that the Wavemaster and the Heavy
Axe had been hanging out in a place where other PCs couldn’t disturb them.
Tsukasa and Subaru had been doing that even before the former was returned to
the real world, what could stop them from doing it again now? Mimiru only
wondered how they could sit in one place and do nothing without being bored to
death. Those two girls were odd... just odd....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Anyways, since you’re bored,” Bear cleared his
throat, “why don’t you come visit us? Subaru’s coming over for dinner later.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Really? Can I? Can I?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Of course.” The middle-aged man patted her gently on
the head. “You’re always welcome to visit. Tsukasa would love to see you, I’m
sure.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hurray!” A huge smile split Mimiru’s face into two.
There was nothing to eat at her house tonight, since her mom and dad had gone
off to some high school reunion party without her, and although they did leave money
for her to order whatever she could think of, she wasn’t exactly in the mood
for having dinner all by herself. Bear’s invitation, in fact, was a lifeboat
thrown to her while she was drowning in the ocean. Besides... coming there
would mean meeting Tsukasa again. Mimiru had missed the girl so very much....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

living room and listening intently to his cell phone when he heard the sound of
a key twisting inside the lock of the front door. He didn’t have to wait to
hear the voice of a girl laughing wholeheartedly a few seconds later to know
that his adopted daughter had brought her friend home. Quickly murmuring a few
words of apology and a promise to call back later into the phone, Ryo hung up
and placidly walked to the entrance, where he found the familiar figure of the
twenty-year-old Misono Mariko. The paraplegic girl, bespectacled and clad in
casual clothes that could hide neither her beauty nor the calm and soothing
aura she radiated, was sitting quietly on her wheelchair while Ryo’s little
daughter was kneeling in front of her and helping her take the shoes off.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Good afternoon, Ryo-san.” Mariko offered him a
respectful bow from where she sat.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Welcome to my humble abode, Lady Subaru.” Ryo
returned the bow with a deep incline of his head. “I hope you will enjoy your
stay.” He made the young woman smile.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh, dad, I thought you wouldn’t be home until the
evening,” said An, who raised her head and blinked at Ryo. If anything, she
sounded more disappointed than surprised. Ryo, on the other hand, knew
perfectly why the girl did. Years of studying human behaviors for his novels
and associating with all sorts of people in real life as well as in The World
had but taught him how to derive meanings from even the smallest gestures of
his adopted child. Besides, An wasn’t exactly difficult to read the way she
wore her heart on her sleeve as soon as she got within twenty feet of Mariko
anyway....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“BT couldn’t go,” Ryo explained. “We planned to have
lunch and then go to some movie together but she called me earlier and told me
that her boss summoned her back to her company. We had no other choice but to
cancel the date.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I see,” An muttered almost dejectedly. Mariko, on the
other hand, confined herself to a knowing and amused chuckle behind her dainty
raised hand.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“More importantly, An,” Ryo said casually, “when are
you going to finish what you’re doing?” He had to try his best to keep a
straight face. His daughter gave him a confused look before she looked down at
her hands and realized that she was still holding Mariko’s bare foot in such a
way that she would make any sale assistant at a shoe store blush. Cheeks
aflame, the brown-haired girl let go of her friend’s foot and started working
on the other one while Mariko looked at her with a tender face that spoke of
volumes of affection.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“So, kiddies, what do you want for dinner?” Ryo asked.
“I’ll be your chef tonight.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I thought we were ordering food from that Chinese
restaurant, dad.” An stared at him. He could almost hear the note of fright
entering the girl’s voice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well, that was what I intended but... I don’t really
like the one delivery guy they had,” Ryo said. “He likes to dawdle so it’d be a
miracle if we get our food within an hour. Besides, I can cook, you know.” He
glanced at his adopted daughter playfully.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You sure?” An glanced back at him, her pace painted
with disbelief. “The last time you made curry, you made it taste like cat chow.
Besides... you mainly lived on canned food when I was at school, didn’t you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You made it sound like a bad thing,” Ryo said in a
feigned disapproving tone. Meanwhile, Mariko’s quiet chuckle in the background
only grew richer. “And I will have you know that I followed the recipe very
carefully. It had that horrible taste in the end was only because....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You mistook sugar for salt,” An cut in, “and somehow
you managed to pour half a bottle or so of vinegar into the pot without ever
noticing it.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Exactly, innocent mistakes,” Ryo declared. “I assure
you that there won’t be a second time.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You said that the time before last too, and look what
happened.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh come on, stop making your father look bad in front
of your friend, will you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m really glad that you get along so well, An,
Ryo-san,” Mariko said, a bright smile adorning her lips, true joy shining in
her amber eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Ryo laughed “If getting along meant that we argued
every time she came home in the weekend or holidays, then we certainly did.”
That was the truth, though. He and An tended to debate over the strangest and
most trivial thing as soon as they went near each other. However, their words
never held any heat, and both of them knew perfectly well that they were ninety
percent playful and ten percent serious. They argued for fun, and that was it.
Compared to the hell that was the cold atmosphere between Ryo and his
biological son, verbal jousting with An surely was nothing less than a
paradise. Besides, he, too, was aware of the fact that An had been tight-mouthed
since she was little. The fact that she was willing to speak at length with him
clearly showed that she had accepted him as a part of her life, something that
more than warmed his heart.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Anyways, I was kidding earlier when I said I was
going to cook... but I was serious about not ordering Chinese food. Hey, An,
how about I take you two to some good restaurant BT recommended earlier?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The brown-haired girl gave her lips a few thoughtful
taps before she said, “I think staying home is fine. I’ll do the cooking.” She
got down on one knee in front of her friend, looked up at her, and asked, “Is
there anything you particularly crave for at the moment, Mariko?” Ryo could
have sworn that his daughter had never spoken to him in such a sweet and gentle
voice before. But well... An showing signs of favoritism was nothing new to
him. After all, he knew perfectly well that despite the fact that he had
adopted her and given her a new life, he would never be able to grow as close
to An as Mariko was.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You know how to cook?” Mariko blinked at her friend,
surprise evident on her youthful face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I never told you?” An scratched the back of her head
and asked ruefully. “But yeah, I do. Before I came to live here, I spent the
majority of my time staying indoor, you know. I had to learn how to cook or I’d
starve for sure.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I see,” Mariko said quietly as she looked at An with
her amber eyes that were glowing with sympathy. Ryo guessed the young woman was
thinking about how much An had suffered during the time she lived with her
biological father. Truth be told, Ryo himself always found rage choking his
throat whenever he thought of the man who had ruined the first seventeen years
of An’s precious life. He still couldn’t believe how such a vulgar,
cold-hearted, and despicable man could exist.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sighing, he decided to change the topic. “Yes, you
don’t need to hold out on us, Mariko. Tell us what you want. If An can’t make
it, most likely she can’t anyway, I’ll find a place to order it for you.” That
earned him a glance of disapproval from his adopted daughter. He elected to
ignore it.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Then, I guess I’d like something with lots of
vegetable.” Mariko smiled. “Anything’s fine.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How about some chicken salad with mandarin orange?”
An suggested. “It’s easy to make, and it tastes very good.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sounds wonderful,” replied the paraplegic young lady,
her smile growing wider and wider as she focused her gaze upon An.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An, our fridge is empty,” Ryo reminded his daughter.
Actually it wasn’t, as there were a few casks of beers inside but....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s okay. I’ll write out all the ingredients I need.
Would you get them from the grocery store for me then, dad?” the girl said,
seemingly unable to peel her deep blue eyes off her friend on the wheelchair.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Me? Why me? I thought I <i>was</i> the father.” Ryo
feigned displeasure.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Who else?” An gave him a look and acted as if what
she said was the most obvious thing in the world. “I’m not taking Mariko
outside again in this cold weather.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You can go alone,” Ryo suggested.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“And leave Mariko to you? No way. You’ll bore her to
death with your old man talk.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She may like to hear about the novel I’m currently
working on.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No she won’t. Your writing is horrible.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why you....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko burst into a fit of laughter that didn’t die
down a few minutes after An and Ryo had stopped their mock shouting match. The
young woman had had to pull a handkerchief from her coat pocket to dab at a few
tears that leaked from the corners of her eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Fine, fine,” Ryo said. “Write me your ingredients.
I’ll go.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay. I’ll be right back, Mariko.” With that, An
hurried inside.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry, Mariko,” Ryo told his guest. “We’ve been
talking for so long and we haven’t even invited you into the living room. How
rude of us.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You seem to be leading a very exciting life with An
here, Ryo-san,” Mariko smiled and commented.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well yes,” Ryo answered with a smile of his own. “The
house was always noisy with her around during weekends, so much so that when
she left for school, I felt as if it had become quieter than a grave. I really
missed her during the weekdays as a result, you see.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m surprised she was <i>this</i> lively at home,”
Mariko said. “She’s usually very quiet around me.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘Not that surprising, Lady Subaru,’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Ryo thought.<i> ‘An would be just as lively around
anybody she trusts. She was quiet when you two were alone because she spent too
much time looking at you to remember how to talk. Besides, she loves you so
much I doubt she can think straight in your presence.’</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">He couldn’t say that right out, though, so he kept his
mouth shut. He shouldn’t let the two of them know that he had been aware of the
<i>change</i> in their relationship from the very start, in any event. An
wouldn’t appreciate it if he did. She’d think that he had been sniffing around
on them or something. Once, in the past, when An was still trapped as Tsukasa
in The World, she had been very displeased upon learning that Ryo had been
investigating her true identity in the real world. The girl’s sense of privacy
was <i>really</i> prickly sometimes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Footsteps thundered toward them as the brown-haired
girl emerged from the living room.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Here you go, dad,” said An, who handed Ryo a piece of
paper as soon as she got close to him. She seemed very eager to kick him out of
the house. He could only chuckle to himself in mild exasperation. He guessed a
dad ranked way below a girlfriend in his daughter’s list, after all.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay, fine, fine, but I’ll need to make a phone call
first. I’ll go after that. Happy?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yep,” his adopted daughter with no hesitation in
her... joyous voice. Ryo all but wondered whether he had spoiled her too much.
But oh well, An was a good girl at heart. No matter how much one spoiled her,
she couldn’t be half as bad at his biological son, he supposed. Besides, he wasn’t
the only one who did that anyway. Ryo glanced at Mariko, who was gazing at his
daughter as if no one else in this whole wide world existed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sure, I’ll take Mariko to my room, then,” An said. Suddenly,
her cheeks colored furiously as though she had just realized that she had
uttered something very embarrassing.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Do you need a hand? Your room is on the second
floor,” Ryo reminded her. If anything, his question seemed to have only fanned
the flames that were raging on his daughter’s cheeks. She was red all the way
to her ears now. For some reason, though, a faint light of defiance glowed in
her deep blue eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s okay. I can carry Mariko on my own,” An
muttered. Ryo wagered that even if An was going to break her back bringing the
young woman to her room, she still would not ask for his help. An was a
possessive girl, after all. There was just no way in hell she’d let anyone else
touch Mariko.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Be careful, then,” Ryo said.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes, I will,” answered An as she bent over and
carefully scooped Mariko up into her arms. The latter, whose face was utterly
gentle and slightly colored, put her arms around An’s neck, rested her head
upon An’s shoulder, and let the girl carry her up the stair that led to the second
floor. Eyes glued at his daughter’s retreating back, Ryo asked himself for the
thousandth time whether An was going to be happier, or sadder at the
announcement he was going to make.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m heavy, aren’t I?” Misono Mariko asked as her back
was being laid against the headboard of An’s queen-sized bed. The brown-haired
girl’s room, large and better furnished than most of the rooms Mariko had had
the chance to visit, contained everything one could possibly need. It would
appear that Ryo-san never even thought of holding back on the money when he
bought the state-of-the-art PC that was installed with the latest ALTIMIT
Operating System, a powerful air conditioner that would be a relief in Tokyo’s
scorching summers and freezing winters, and a wardrobe that was twice as large
as Mariko’s own. She guessed it was racked with pretty and expensive clothes,
too. Oh how glad she was that An had Ryo-san for a dad, someone who loved her,
who cared for her as if she was his true daughter.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No.” An shook her head. The high school freshman was
standing at the edge of the bed, face as red as it was when she picked Mariko
up and carried her to the second floor. “You’re not heavy,” she insisted in a
soft voice even when the beading sweat on her forehead told Mariko otherwise.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m a bit taller than you, An,” Mariko said with a
smile. “And I know how much I weighed. Come over here, please?” She extended a
hand to the younger girl, who took it and let herself be pulled gently onto the
bed. By Mariko’s side, upon the soft mattress, An sat quietly on her knees,
chin slightly raised up, deep blue eyes locked with Mariko’s amber, crimson
face radiating so much heat Mariko could feel it caressing her own. “Carrying
me must have been torturous for you,” Mariko joked as she pulled her
handkerchief out and tenderly dried An’s cheeks, temples, and forehead. When
she was done and tried to withdraw her hand, An took it by the wrist and
continued to hold it against her face. Mariko felt as though she herself was
about to blush.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Even if you were twice as heavy, even if you wanted
me to carry you all my life, I’d be more than willing to, Mariko...” An said,
both voice and hands trembling slightly, her eyes downcast. Mariko gazed at the
girl she loved, feeling as though she was drifting on a sea of clouds. Those
words, simple as they were, must have been spoken with all of An’s heart. Else,
they would have never sounded so sincere, so affectionate, and so moving at the
same time.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Quietly, she pulled the high school freshman into a
warm hug and murmured softly into her ear, “Silver Knight was a troublesome man
whose common sense was corroded by his code of loyalty and honor. He lured you
into a trap in The World, bound you, and imprisoned you. Yet, without him, I’d
have never met and fallen in love with you, An. I’ll always be grateful to him
for that.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I still think that you’re better off without me,
Mariko,” An whispered, her arms tightening around Mariko’s back, her voice
growing more and more anxious with every passing second.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko pulled away and looked at the high school
freshman sitting by her side. This wasn’t the first time An was bothered by
this exact same issue. It was one of the reasons why she <i>avoided</i> Mariko
in the first place, for crying out loud.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She could still remember the first offline meeting
between her and the girl she had come to love. It was the day following one in
which the A.I. <i>Aura</i> awakened, in which the hacker Helba abandoned Net
Slum to avoid the invasion of a humanoid data stream that was undoubtedly
malicious. Mariko’s connection was terminated and she was violently tossed out
of The World as a result. When she reconnected, she could no longer find the PC
named Tsukasa in any of the Root Towns, or the places they usually went to
spend time by each other’s side. She had wanted to go to the hospital where
Tsukasa was kept in a vegetative state immediately... but she couldn’t. It was
a Friday, and her mom was still busy at work, so there was nothing she could
do. The following morning, on the way to her desired destination, she was
finally able to meet the person who held her heart. That person was a
seventeen-year-old girl named Shouji An.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">At first, Mariko and An were as inseparable as they
were back in The World. During the first week following An’s return, the girl
had no school so she was able to visit Mariko every day, mostly in the mornings
when Madoka was already off to work. They would sit by each other like always
and simply enjoyed each other’s company. Life had been so peaceful, so sweet,
and so fulfilling... until Sakuma Ryo-san enrolled An in a boarding school on
the other side of the city. By then, Mariko had already realized that although
they were of the same gender, the feelings Mariko harbored toward An hadn’t
changed one bit. The girl never failed to make her heart sing upon every
meeting, nor did she ever stop making Mariko miss her day and night. She didn’t
need to be told that she was already helplessly in love.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Knowing full well that her heart was no longer hers,
Mariko tried her hardest to stay in touch with An, hoping that her feelings
were mutual. Yet, despite Mariko’s efforts, they started to drift apart. The
number of phone calls they made became fewer and fewer, the duration of each
call shorter and shorter, until An called no more. When the girl stopped
visiting altogether during weekends, Mariko was but overwhelmed by anxiety.
Since An stopped returning her calls, Mariko had no way of knowing what had
gone wrong between them. At that point, she was only afraid that An had found
someone she truly loved.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Worried, lovesick, and terribly anxious, Mariko
finally decided to call the sole person who could help her. Sakuma Ryo-san,
An’s foster father. From the novelist’s sudden pause on the phone, she guessed
he had been very surprised when she asked him to take her to the school in
which An was enrolled. Thankfully and fortunately, Ryo-san had agreed
afterwards without bothering to ask why Mariko wanted to do such a thing, or
why she had to ask him instead of his daughter. Within an hour’s time, she and
Ryo-san arrived at Touyou Eiwa Jogakuin, in the dormitory of which the high
school freshman currently stayed. Oh how An had been shocked upon seeing Mariko
and Ryo-san at the door to her room.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

behind the open door in a casual white blouse and a pair of blue denim jeans.
The left side of her face, surprisingly, was imprinted with a swollen red mark
that looked too much like a hand for Mariko’s comfort. She felt her heart
throb. Did someone just hit An? And why? “What are you doing here?”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We were having dinner nearby,” Ryo-san answered after
a brief glance at the red mark on his daughter cheek, “so we decided to drop by
and see how you were doing.” Apparently the man decided not to inquire as to
what had happened.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Nearby?” An said suspiciously. Her deep blue eyes
were so fixated on her foster father that it was clear she was avoiding looking
at Mariko. She only wanted to cry. “But you two live on the other side of the
city!”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Does that mean we can’t have a meal wherever we
want?” Ryo-san laughed. “I’ll have you know that Ethiopian restaurant’s
extremely well-known. Even the infamous picky eater BT was pleased by the food
they served.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I see,” replied An, who didn’t seem to have believed
the story. Well, at least half of it was the truth. Mariko and Ryo-san did go
to that Ethiopian restaurant for dinner before they came here. Mariko hadn’t
exactly wanted to do that, for she only wished to see An as soon as possible,
but the novelist informed her that An had club activities until seven in the
evening every Tuesday so they had at least an hour to spare. Besides, since
Ryo-san said that his stomach was empty, and that he really wanted to try out
the restaurant BT recommended, Mariko couldn’t bring herself to refuse him. She
was the one asking for a favor, after all....</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Anyways, I’ll leave you two alone,” the tall novelist
declared, “There’s someone I need to see on campus.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Someone?” An asked skeptically.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“My old friend the headmistress,” Ryo-san answered
with a smile. “She helped smooth your enrollment into this prestigious school,
remember?” With that, he trod down the hallway and left, leaving Mariko at the
door to An’s room, awkward, tongue-tied, and slightly afraid of what was going
to happen should she go inside and talk to the girl she loved.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We can’t stand here and talk, can we?” An said after
a while, her voice strangely quiet. “Let me help you inside.” She ran outside
and guided the wheelchair into the room, then closed the door with a very soft
clicking sound of the bolt.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“So... how are you, An?” Mariko asked once the younger
girl had settled on the bed, near where the wheelchair was. There was only one
bed in this room, so Mariko guessed every student had their own private
quarters.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m okay,” the brown-haired girl answered, voice a
bit stiff.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Silence followed, with Mariko gazing at An, who
focused her eyes on the piece of red carpet beneath her bare feet. Suddenly,
Mariko caught sight of something beyond An’s slender shoulders, on the computer
desk in one corner of the room. It was a cute white teddy bear no larger than a
hand, whose paws were holding a piece of heart-shaped red carton that read, </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“For An, my beloved.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That’s a cute teddy bear, An,” Mariko said, her voice
oddly calm and collected. “Where did you get it?”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An looked over her shoulder, saw what Mariko was
referring to... and went pale in the face. “A girl in the movie club... gave it
to me before you and dad came,” she muttered. “She said it was for Valentine’s
Day.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Today’s Valentine’s Day?” Mariko asked distantly. “I
didn’t know.” It was of no surprise to her that she never realized that today
was February the fourteenth, in fact, as she had spent the last ten years of her
life mostly indoor, where she isolated herself from the real world. Besides,
with her mind being clouded by An’s absence and unusual behaviors lately, even
if someone had waved a chocolate box wrapped in red foil beneath her nose,
Mariko still wouldn’t have noticed.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“A week in a new school, and you have someone
interested in you already.” Mariko forced herself to smile. She barely could.
“Is she cute?”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An opened her mouth as though trying to say something,
then firmly closed it and nodded. Mariko felt as though a stake had just been

high school freshman murmured. “There are a lot of other girls who admired her.
I never imagined that she chose me of all people to confess to,”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Lucky you,” Mariko said. The second fake smile came a
bit easier this time. Although... it still hurt so much. “I hope she’ll make
you happy.” Oh how those words rang hollow in Mariko’s own ears.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She won’t,” An said ruefully. Mariko blinked. “She
just slapped me and stormed down the hallway before you guys arrived.” Her hand
rose to touch her swollen cheek. The girl grimaced. “I didn’t know she was so
strong. Not even Mimiru hurt me this badly when she hit me in The World.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“But... she gave you that present and confessed to
you! How could she hurt you?” The answer came to Mariko even before she
finished what she was saying.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I told her I wasn’t interested,” An replied, her face
growing redder and redder. “Somehow, we got into this huge shouting match and
she got really, really offended by something I said. In the end, she slapped me
and left.” Her gaze fell upon her desk, where her little teddy bear was. “I
wish she would take it with her, though.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What did you tell her to have made her so angry?”
Mariko asked.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well... I... I... forgot already,” said An, who
looked away in what was obviously guilt. The girl was lying. Mariko was about
to inquire further when the door to the room suddenly swung open and admitted a
tall, lean girl whose black raven hair fell all the way to her waist, and whose
face was so pretty she probably could make any man look twice. Or she would
have, had a shadow of fury not made her seem more than ready to chew rocks.
This must have been the sempai An was just talking about, Mariko said to
herself.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Who’s this?” the newcomer demanded rudely, blatant
jealousy hissing in her heated voice.</span></i></p>

reasons Mariko failed to grasp, the younger girl went red in the face and said
nothing. Meanwhile, her sempai continued to scrutinize Mariko and An with a
pair of brown eyes that seemed to glow even brighter than the fluorescent light
tube hanging on the ceiling. The tall girl looked more and more annoyed by the
second, Mariko noticed.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m Misono Mariko,” she decided to introduce herself,
since it was evident An was trying her best </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">not<i> to do that. “Pleased to make your acquaintance.”</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“My name’s Nagamatsu Kaori. I’m....” The raven-haired
girl was about to say something else, too, when she suddenly trailed off.
“You’re </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko<i>?” If her voice was
merely heated before, it was now as hot as a roaring furnace. Her face suddenly
grew so dark Mariko thought she’d have apoplexy.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What did you come back here for, Kaori-sempai? I
thought we were clear. Please leave, I have a visitor,” An said hastily. If
Mariko were to guess, she would say that An was more than eager to kick
Nagamatsu out of the room. Was it because the latter had slapped the former...
or was it because the former had some strange motive behind her lack of
friendliness?</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“So </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">she<i>
was the reason you rejected me.” Nagamatsu Kaori looked at An, her cold and
sharp gaze very much at odds with the raging firestorm that was her voice. “You
didn’t mention she was a </i>cripple<i>, though.” Those last words came out with
a contemptuous sneer on the girl’s lips.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Face suddenly blank, An closed the distance between
her and her sempai, raised her hand, and gave the latter a full-arm slap. As if
thunderstruck, Nagamatsu stared at An in disbelief and said nothing while blood
silently trickled out of the corner of her mouth. Even Mariko blinked in shock.
She never once imagined that An, shy and gentle as she was, would one day
resort to violence.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How dare you?!” the taller girl shrieked. She fell
silent, however, when her eyes fell upon the expression on her kouhai’s face.
The latter was shorter than the former at least by a full head, yet with her
grim face and her thinned lips, An managed to exude a presence that dwarfed
that of any other in this room. She looked... murderous.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You say that word one more time and I swear you’ll
gain more than just a few bruises, sempai,” the brown-haired freshman said
angrily. “Now leave or I’ll notify the dorm manager.” Her hand, the palm of
which was slightly reddened from hitting Nagamatsu Kaori, was hovering near a
small button on the wall.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’ll regret this, Shouji. Mark my words!” was what
the raven-haired girl said before she turned and hurried out of the room.</span></i></p>

knelt down in front of the wheelchair, her face was a mask of agony. “I’m sorry
my sempai said something so horrible to you, Mariko,” she said in a deeply
apologetic voice.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“People have been calling me worse, An, so I don’t
care anymore.” Mariko smiled at the girl three years her junior, then raised
her hand and touched An’s left swollen cheek. “What I do care about, though, is
why Nagamatsu said I was the reason you rejected her. Would you tell me,
please?”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An gazed at Mariko for a good five minutes, face
clouded by a screen of melancholy, before she decided to talk, “When I told
Kaori that I wasn’t interested in being her girlfriend, she asked me why. I
said I was already in love with another girl... and that girl was a hundred
times cuter and nicer than her.” Mariko’s pulse quickened. “Kaori didn’t sit
well with that, so as you know, we got in a shouting match and my tongue
slipped... and I accidentally mentioned your name.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko took a deep breath. </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Accidentally”,<i> An had said. Had she only wanted to
use Mariko as an excuse to drive Nagamatsu Kaori away, she would have mentioned
Mariko’s name from the very start. But in that case... did that mean...?</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why did you say such a thing, An?” Mariko asked.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The high school freshman fell silent. When she spoke
up again, her face was set with determination, “I’m sorry. I... just remember
that I have to do something. I... may not return for the night. I’ll call dad
to pick you up. I’m... sorry.” She rose to her feet and strode toward the door.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Being fully aware that An was running away and that
unless she was stopped, Mariko would lose her chance forever, she placed her
hands on the handles of the wheelchair and summoned every ounce of strength she
had to push herself out of the seat. In a loud, painful thumping sound, she
landed on her stomach upon the carpeted floor, where she felt a terrible
sensation rippling along her every fiber. A storm of fireflies erupted across
her vision as she cried out in pain. Under normal circumstances, she wouldn’t
have, as she had fallen numerous times ever since her legs were rendered
useless, yet she knew that she needed to, in order to make An turn back.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It worked.</span></i></p>

cried out in concern and agony as she ran to Mariko’s side, where the girl
helped her sit up straight. “How did you...?” She fell silent as soon as Mariko
put her arms around An’s neck and rest her own head on the latter’s shoulder,
though. The girl understood. “Why did you have to do such a dangerous thing to
yourself?” she mumbled, her trembling hands clutching at the fabrics on
Mariko’s back.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Would you have come back had I not done so?” Mariko
said softly. Her young friend opened her mouth to say something, but Mariko
hushed the girl by pressing a finger against her lips. “An, today’s February
the fourteenth, ne? I’m sorry I didn’t remember it in time to make you some
chocolate,” she murmured as her hands reached inside the collar of her shirt
and took out her necklace, which consisted of a little silver chain attached
with a small bag woven from ornate cloth that she never took off unless she was
in the shower. “But if you don’t mind, please accept this, An. Happy
Valentine’s Day.” She put the piece of ornament around An’s neck.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The other girl’s deep blue eyes went as wide as they
could. “But this... is the </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">omamori<i>
charm you’ve been keeping for the last ten years!” she stammered while
frantically trying to take the necklace off and return it to Mariko. She didn’t
want that, so she put her hands atop An’s own and stopped her.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Have you come to dislike me so much you won’t even
accept a present from me?” Mariko gave An a soft smile that was meant to tell
the girl she wasn’t serious.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She knew why the girl panicked so, though. After all,
the </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">omamorifuda<i> hidden within that
ornately woven bag was what her mom bought from the Grand Shrine of Ise itself.
Shortly after the car accident took away Mariko’s father and her ability to
walk, while Mariko was still lying helplessly and unconsciously on a hospital
bed, Madoka had traveled all the way to Ise to pray for Mariko’s recovery. When
her mom returned, she brought with her this omamori good-luck charm as a
present and told Mariko that she had to wear it on her neck at all times. She
didn’t know whether the charm held mystical powers or not, but it was a fact
that for the last ten years, she hadn’t experienced anything more perilous than
a few scratches and bruises.</i></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I can’t accept this, Mariko!” An said hastily.</span></i></p>

you haven’t noticed, I love you, An.” The high school freshman gaped at her
openly. “It protected me for ten years. Now I want it to keep you safe, too.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Silence stretched between them as Mariko gazed at the
girl to whom she just confessed her feelings. An, whose face was reddening,
decided to speak up after a while, “But... I’m a girl.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I fell for you all the way back in The World, where I
had no idea how you looked like.” Mariko sighed. “Even after you told me that
you might be a girl in real life, my feelings never changed.” She took the other
girl’s right hand and placed it on her left chest. An blushed furiously. “It
was your soul that touched me, I told you once, didn’t I?” Mariko continued.
“No matter who you are, An, I will still love you. I mean it.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Her hands rose to cup the brown-haired girl’s cheeks.
Slowly, Mariko lifted her face and pressed her lips against An’s. She stiffened
at first but after a few heartbeats, she tightened her arms around Mariko and
returned the kiss. When their lips parted in the end, Mariko found An gazing back
at her with a pair of deep blue eyes that shone with love. Saying nothing, she
relaxed in the other girl’s embrace and allowed her head to rest against An’s
chest. There, she waited.</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ever since we started hanging out with each other in
real life, I was really happy, Mariko,” An began after a while, just as Mariko
had expected, “I... even planned to make chocolate for you on Valentine’s Day
and confess to you. But then, I started to become afraid.” She paused to take a
breath, then continued, “I was really afraid of rejection, but you know, the
possibility of you accepting my feelings scared me even more.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why?” Mariko asked, puzzled.</span></i></p>

gave her a sad smile. “When I was still living with my real dad, he often said
that it was my fault his business was failing, that it was me who caused my
mom’s death.” Her face grew so mournful Mariko felt her heart ache just from
looking at it. “I think he’s right. Staying near me will only do you harm,
Mariko.”</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That’s not true!” Inside her heart, Mariko could feel
anger rising. What kind of despicable man would blame his failures on his
daughter? What kind of lowlife would say it was her fault that his wife died?</span></i></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No, it’s true,” An insisted. “It was my fault Morgana
tried to kill you. It’s because of me that the Crimson Knights abandoned you.
I’m a burden to whoever I love. I only invite trouble, you see.”</span></i></p>

be. Since our meeting in The World, my life has become more meaningful than it
ever was. There were times I thought I would commit suicide to free myself from
the hardships I had to endure every single day. An, you’re the only person in
this world who showed me that there was still joy in continuing to live. To me,
you’re not simply a necessity, you’re my one and only saving grace, you have to
know that.” Her hand rose upward caress the cheek of the girl she dearly loved.
“Morgana targeted me </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">because<i> she
noticed I was attracted to you so greatly I couldn’t help but stay close to
you. I disbanded the Crimson Knights </i>because<i> they had strayed too far
away from the ideal I wanted to preserve. They weren’t your fault.”</i></span></p>

indeed invite trouble, I don’t care. The worst thing that can happen to me is
losing you, An, why can’t you see?” Cupping An’s face in both hands, Mariko
gazed into the girl’s deep blue eyes intently, praying to the Gods of Heaven
that her words could make An change her mind. From the girl’s softening
countenance, from her trembling hands that pressed against Mariko’s own ever so
gently, Mariko knew her prayer hadn’t been wasted.</span></i></p>

was the older, the more experienced, and the more mature... yet in An’s arms
she always felt as though she was once more a teenager whose brain melted every
time she was touched by the one she loved.</span></p>

your <i>mom</i>, the only family member you have left... and she dislikes me.”
Her hands clutched the fabric on Mariko’s back. “I don’t want to be the reason

better for us just to enjoy the moment like we always did back in The World?”</span></p>

hand and playfully pinched the younger girl’s cheek. “He told me he was invited
to the screening premiere. He said your sempais were very pleased about your
performance, An.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Stupid dad, why did you have to tell her?” the high
school freshman muttered under her breath. Judging by the girl’s irritated
tone, Mariko was quite sure Ryo-san would have an earful from his adopted
daughter as soon as he returned.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why shouldn’t he tell me?” Mariko smiled tenderly at
An, her hand ruffling the latter’s soft brown hair. An gave a start at the
question. Mariko didn’t think the girl meant what she said to be heard.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well... um...” An hesitated, “It’s because well...
Kaori was the other leading role in the movie. It’s a love story; I played a
man, she a woman... and I had to kiss her in the end.” She gave an exasperated
shake of her head. “I curse whoever it was that wrote that script. And the
darned director who wanted it to be a <i>real</i> lip-lock, too!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I thought your sempai bore a grudge against you now,”
Mariko said, puzzled. “Why would she let you do that to her?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That’s the point. She knew I hated her, and that
smooching her would disgust me no end,” her girlfriend answered, sounding
extremely depressed. “It was her own way of getting back at me.” She sighed.
“She was right. I spent almost half an hour in the restroom afterwards, trying
to wash my mouth clean.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s just a kiss.” Mariko smiled.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What do you mean it’s <i>just</i> a kiss...?” An
frowned at her. “Even if I didn’t hate Kaori, there still would be no way in
hell I’d be willing to kiss her. Or anyone!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“And why’s that?” Mariko asked innocently.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An’s face began to color. “You’re the only one I want
to kiss.... Why do you have to ask me what you already knew?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No I didn’t. You never told me that right out,”
Mariko murmured before she raised her head to place a quick peck on each of
An’s cheeks. Looking at An’s utterly embarrassed and adorable expression,
Mariko couldn’t help but feel that perhaps the Gods had compensated more than
enough for her disability by introducing An into her life. “Anyways, where’s
the recording? I really want to see,” she said gently.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay fine,” the other girl grumbled as she untangled
herself from Mariko’s arms and got off the bed. “Don’t blame me if you get
jealous in the end.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A few minutes later, Mariko found herself once more
reclining against the headboard, watching the movie on the flat-panel TV
standing opposite the bed, her head on An’s shoulder, their arms linked, their
hands laced, their hearts beating together in a quiet rhythm. Eyes glued at the
screen, every once in a while glancing aside to take in the endearing facial
features of the one she loved, Mariko simply marveled at how well An performed
in the movie. The lines she read were perfectly natural, the expressions on her
face never seemed faked, and the way she interacted with other characters was
simply marvelous. Years of watching movies in her room had finally paid off,
Mariko supposed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Near the end of the movie, An, in a three-piece suit,
pulled Nagamatsu Kaori, in a white wedding dress, into an embrace in a church
and placed a kiss upon the latter’s lips. Noticing the malicious gleam in Nagamatsu’s
eyes and the tight corners of An’s deep blue ones, Mariko turned aside, wanting
to tease her girlfriend a little bit. What she found, however, was the younger
girl’s lips an inch away from hers. An gave a violent start and turned away,
her face as red as the content of any watermelon.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry,” she mumbled.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Feeling a blush creeping onto her cheeks, Mariko put a
hand on An’s face and turned it around so they could look into each other’s
eyes. “Why do you have to apologize for wanting to kiss your girlfriend?” she
murmured before she moved in, wrapped her arms tenderly around the neck of the
high school freshman, and finally captured An’s sweet and soft lips. Her body
being lowered to the soft mattress of the bed was the last thing she sensed before
her rational thoughts surrendered to the earthly passion kindled by the
intensity of the kiss.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oy, An, Mariko, Ryo-san told me to bring you some
fruits...” a girl’s voice said suddenly and stopped, followed by the sound of
china shattering upon the floor. Startled, An literally leapt away from Mariko
and ended up falling out of the bed. “I’m sorry!” Footsteps faded hurriedly
into the distance.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Are you okay, An?” Mariko asked worriedly once she
had sat up straight on the mattress. “Are you hurt?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ugh, I’m okay,” the younger girl answered and rose
slowly to her feet. She winced as she sat back down on the bed, by Mariko’s
side. “Landed on my back, so....” She trailed off and looked at Mariko
worriedly. “That was... Kanae, right?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko nodded. That voice indeed belonged to Mitsuki
Kanae, the Heavyblade who called herself Mimiru in The World. Why was she here
today? “Did you forget to lock the door, An?” she asked, eyes glancing at the
one she loved in amusement. An wasn’t absent-minded in nature, yet with Mariko
around, An forgot things normal people rarely would. Like locking the door for
instant....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well... now that I think of it...” An said ruefully,
“I don’t think I even closed it. I carried you into the room, put you down on
the bed, then....” Her face went crimson, probably because of the memory of
what had happened... or would have happened had Kanae not interrupted them.
Well, Mariko was at fault, too, for during all the time she spent with An in
this room, she never paid a scrap of attention to the door, or even cared
whether it was open or not. She guessed she had become forgetful in An’s
presence, just as the latter was in hers.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Anyways, I think I’ll go talk to her, wait for me a
little bit, ne?” was what An said before she gathered the broken shards of the
china disc into a rubber tray and left, her face heavy with worries. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Alone in the room, Mariko began to think about the
consequences of this unexpected turn of events. Now that Kanae had found out
about her and An’s relationship... what would the girl do? Would she make a
fuss and start to avoid them because of their love? Or would she laugh it off
and act like nothing had happened? Mariko only hoped it was the latter. Kanae
was a good friend who had shared more than just ups and downs with them in The
World. Mariko truly didn’t want to lose her.</span></p>
