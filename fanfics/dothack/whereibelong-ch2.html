<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Uh, hi there!” Mitsuki Kanae exclaimed awkwardly when
she opened the door to An’s room and found the paraplegic young woman sitting
on the bed with her back against the headboard. “Uh, how are you?” She climbed
onto the bed and settled down by Mariko’s side, carefully making sure that she
wouldn’t sit on the latter’s legs by mistake. Stealing a glance at the
twenty-year-old, Kanae felt warmth blossoming on her cheeks. She seriously
doubted the image of An and Mariko on the bed, arms entwining around each
other’s body, lips locked in a kiss, was going to fade from her mind anytime
soon. Sure, she had been going online since she was twelve or so... but
honestly she hadn’t seen two girls kissing ever before. That... surely was a
first.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hi, Kanae,” Mariko said with a smile. “It’s been more
than a month since we last hung out in Shimokitazawa, hasn’t it? How’ve you
been?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Same old, same old.” Kanae returned the smile. “It’s
still boring as usual.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Boring? Shouldn’t you be worrying about your senior
high entrance exam right now?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh that. My school has an elevator system extending
all the way through college,” Kanae answered with a grin. “That’s why
everything’s kinda lax in my class. That’s why I could spend so much time in
The World with you guys when most kids my age went crazy doing homework or
getting supplementary classes.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“And that’s also why you were bored most of the
times?” Mariko chuckled quietly behind her raised hand.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well, I guess.” Kanae scratched the back of her head
and laughed. “What am I to do? The teachers don’t assign much homework, they
don’t lecture seriously, and they won’t even bother to check if we’re cheating
during exams. I’m not exactly motivated to study in that case now am I?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sounds like it’d be a breeze until you graduate from
the university, then,” the young woman commented, her smile unwavering on her
lips. Kanae couldn’t help but notice that Mariko had been smiling a lot more
than she used to when she, An, and Kanae went window-shopping in the
Shimokitazawa Mall. If anything, Mariko’s smiling face only enhanced the
natural charm and beautiful face that Kanae would kill to have. She guessed
this was how one would become when one fell in love....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Is there something on my face?” Mariko asked
suddenly. Kanae gave a start. She had been staring openly at the young woman,
it appeared.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh no, it’s... nothing!” Kanae said hastily. She
didn’t have to find a mirror to look into to know that she was blushing. She
should have knocked before she entered even when the door was open. That way,
she would have remained blissfully ignorant about the whole relationship
business between her girl friends. That way... she wouldn’t have realized what
kind of effect the very sight of An kissing Mariko so affectionately would
produce on her mind.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“So, why did you come back here alone, Kanae?” Mariko
asked. “Where’s An?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah, we were... um... talking on the balcony when
Oji-chan called An and told her that the ingredients were ready,” she
explained. “She’s down in the kitchen right now.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Has An managed to tell you about us before she was
called to the kitchen?” Mariko said quietly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yeah... she did.” Kanae scratched the back of her
head again.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sure our images in your mind have changed
somewhat, ne?” Mariko said, her smile growing more and more rueful after every word.
“I’m sorry we kept it from you. Would you forgive us?” Mariko gave Kane a deep
bow where she sat.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Forgive.... What is there to forgive?” She scratched
the back of her head again and gave a quiet chuckle. “Is there any rule that
says you <i>have</i> to tell your friends the second you start dating?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Guess there isn’t,” Mariko smiled and said.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Say, Mariko, um....” Kanae gave the woman five years
her senior a gentle poke on her arm with her finger. “What do you usually do
when you’re together?” A mischievous grin curved her lips, which made the
blue-haired young woman color faintly. She looked nothing alike the Heavy Axe
Subaru, Leader of the proud and prickly Crimson Knights. “Give me the juicy
details, will you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In The World, Mariko was the very example of a perfect
leader. She was in total control of her emotion, she was able to keep her calm
even in dire situations, and she commanded a presence that inspired confidence
and awe. Yet, Kanae wagered that no one could have associated the unflappable
Lady Subaru with this paraplegic woman sitting on the bed, who was growing
embarrassed just from a simple question posed to her by a junior high student. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh come on,” she urged, “It’s not that difficult.
It’s not like I asked where An touched you when you two were in private,
right?” Unable to help herself, Kanae let out a small giggle that earned her a <i>very</i>
startled look from Mariko.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What kind of perverted fifteen-year-old are you,
Kanae?” the young woman asked, the color on her cheeks deepening.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“One whose classmates spent a lot of time gossiping
about that kind of stuff?” she countered with a grin. “I’m not interested, for
your information, but when they kept on droning about it every time they were
out of the teacher’s earshot, I couldn’t help but learn a few things even when
I tried not to.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Your school’s a co-ed one, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yup.” Kanae nodded. “Why did you ask?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m just curious,” replied the paraplegic woman.
“I’ve always attended all girls’ schools all the way through senior high, you
see. That’s why I sometimes wondered how it’d feel to have boys for
classmates.” She poked Kanae gently on the shoulder. “How many of them do you
have in your class?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Quite a few,” she answered. “They’re a bunch of
good-for-nothing, though. They mainly stuck together and drooled like a bunch
of dimwits over the ero-magazines they snuck into the classroom. Sometimes I
think they have too much hormones for their own good.” Her mouth twisted
slightly in distaste. “What’s with them and their fascination over big boobs
anyway?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“They can’t be all bad,” Mariko commented in
amusement. “There has to be someone you don’t dislike, I’m sure.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“None I tell you, none!” As soon as she finished
saying that, she blinked and gave Mariko a sidelong glance. “You sneak,
Mariko,” she said, “you’re trying to change the topic and make me forget about
my inquiry, aren’t you?” The grimace that was formed on the blue-haired woman’s
face told Kanae that she had guessed correctly. “Nice try, but it isn’t going
to work. When I want something, I won’t stop until I get it.” Heck, even An,
when she was still trapped as Tsukasa in The World, failed to chase Kanae away
once she had made up her mind that she was going to become the other girl’s
friend. If Kanae wanted, she could be even more unrelenting than a vial of
superglue.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“If you want to know so badly, why don’t you get a
girlfriend, Kanae?” Mariko suggested with a playful gleam in her amber eyes.
“Wouldn’t it be much better than me telling you about it?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Gods, no!” Kanae exclaimed. “Girls are even worse
than boys in some aspects, for pity’s sake!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">If she was irritated by the boys, she was almost
driven insane by the female population of her class. During her three years in
junior high, she constantly found herself wondering whether the other girls had
other things to think about rather than boys who obviously were only interested
in their bust size. That was why during those last three years, Kanae had
stayed a loner. She did try to seek out others and make friends so that she
could find some saving grace in a school that bored her to death, she did! Too
bad, she never succeeded. She guessed it was because she was too much of a
tomboy whose hobby involved online gaming, which normal school girls weren’t
terribly fond of. There had been times she considered conforming to the others’
taste... yet the very thought of spending hours flipping over shoujo manga,
gossiping about boys, and exchanging small talks frightened Kanae no end. She
told the young woman as much.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Now you’re being difficult.” Mariko chuckled softly.
“You frown on boys. You dislike hanging out with girls. How on Earth are you
going to find yourself a romantic interest?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Don’t need one, don’t want one.” Kanae stuck out her
tongue. “Significant others are a pain to deal with in the first place.” She
blinked at Mariko. “But hey, you’re avoiding the issue again,” she pointed out.
The young woman sighed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re really persistent, you know,” she said in a
resigned manner. “What do I have to do to make you give up?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“There’s nothing you can do,” Kanae declared. “Let me
be honest with you, if you don’t give me the answer I want, I’ll ask some worse
questions.” She grinned in such an evil way that she even managed to make
Mariko swallow audibly in shock. “You’re not going to like them, I assure you.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay, fine...” Mariko said finally. Kanae could tell,
the woman had stopped thinking that she could get out of this room without
telling Kanae wanted to know. She rewarded herself with a satisfied nod and a
quiet chuckle. This surely was going to be fun.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Looking around the dinner table, which consisted of a
circular slab of marble stone resting on four wooden legs, Sakuma Ryo felt as
though he was tasting dust in his mouth, not the chicken salad with mandarin that
his adopted daughter had spent an hour to make. It wasn’t that the food was
bad. In fact, when the kid brought the dish to the table, Ryo had simply
marveled at her skill, as did the other two girls who sat on either of An’s
sides at the table. Yet, after a few bites, his appetite winked out of
existence. He glanced at the dark-haired fifteen-year-old sitting on his
daughter’s left, Mitsuki Kanae, who was doing her best to suppress her
uneasiness but not quite succeeding. Once in a while, the girl would steal a
glance at An and Mariko, who were sitting quietly, eating, and gazing at each
other in a way that excluded intruders. Well, he couldn’t blame Kanae for
feeling uncomfortable around the two lovebirds. Even he sometimes found himself
wishing that they would either admit it to his face that they were an item...
or just refrain from showing such intimacy to people from whom they <i>tried</i>
to hide their relationship.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">His eyes returned to the junior high student. If Kanae
was reacting this way around An and Mariko, it only followed logically that
she, too, had discovered the kind of bond her friends shared. He gave his lips
a thoughtful tap. After he asked Kanae to bring a dish of fruits to An’s room
about an hour earlier, he had heard the former’s startled voice and the
shattering sound of china almost immediately afterwards. A few minutes later,
he found the two girls standing on the balcony and talking to each other in
such low voices that he couldn’t hear a word from either. Yet, he had realized
that something was amiss the moment he noticed that the expression on An’s face
was rueful while that on Kanae’s was a thorough mix of amusement and surprise.
Now that he looked back at it, yes, it all made sense. Kanae must have walked
in on An and Mariko, consequently learning the truth.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘Gods, shouldn’t you be a little bit more discreet
about it, An?’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Ryo mused to himself.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Still, the sudden disappearance of his appetite had
nothing to do with Kanae’s discomfort. On the other hand, it had everything to
do with the couple who couldn’t seem able to peel their eyes off each other
except once in a while to eat their food. Ryo sighed softly. Looking at them
being so happy around one another so, who would have the heart to announce what
he was going to?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Still... it was what he had to do... so he had better
be quick about it.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“May I have your attention, ladies?” Ryo called as the
same time he tapped his silver spoon on the rim of the china bowl. Three pairs
of eyes, one brown, one blue, and one amber, swiveled to meet his. He cleared
his throat, feeling a pang of guilt in his heart, before he began slowly, “I’ve
been doing researches and making phone calls lately in the hope of finding a
way to cure Mariko’s condition.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Those pairs of innocent eyes widened upon the revelation,
all three shone with surprise, two of them glowing with gratitude that seemed
to hurt him more than made him feel happy. Still, the girls kept silent as
though waiting him to finish making his announcement. From the way An’s right
arm and Mariko’s left were coordinated, there was no doubt these two were
holding each other’s hand beneath the marble slab that was the dinner table.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sighing, Ryo continued, “Two days ago, a contact of
mine informed me that the UCLA in </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">California</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">, a famous and trustworthy medical center, has come up
with a new method to effectively cure paraplegia via surgical operation and
physical rehabilitation. They were confirmed to have been successful in a few
cases brought to their attention, in which the patients’ ability to walk was restored.”
He paused to look at his audience then added, “I would say that if we can bring
Mariko to the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">U.S.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">, the chance of her recovery is miraculously high.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“But...” the young woman hesitated, “My mom can never
afford the fee.” An glanced sideways at her girlfriend, appearing to be doing
her best to restrain herself from pulling the latter into a hug. Kanae’s eyes,
however, remained fixed on An’s worried face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That’s where my friend comes into the picture,” he
said. “Through her, I managed to get in touch with an international charity
association also headquartered in the U.S. Knowing about Mariko’s condition,
they had promised to fully sponsor her treatment in UCLA.” Ryo gave each of the
girls a reassuring smile. “You don’t have to worry about a thing, Mariko. The
association will even cover the living cost for your guardian, namely your mom,
who’ll be accompanying you to the States.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Is... it... real?” Mariko said wonderingly, her hands
rising up to cover her mouth, her eyes growing wetter after every heartbeat.
“I... I... don’t know what to say... Ryo-san.... Thank you!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Unable to say anything else, she buried her face in
her hands and wept. Ryo’s adopted daughter quietly pulled the older woman into
her arms and gently ran her hand up and down the small of the latter’s back.
The brown-haired girl, too, seemed to be on the verge of tears. Of course,
there could be no joy greater than knowing that the one she loved now had a
chance of once again having the life of a normal person, the life that was robbed
from her by the nasty car accident that killed her father and disabled her
legs. Even Ryo himself felt moisture growing in his eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry if I sound skeptical...” Kanae spoke up in
a rueful voice, “but is there no catch at all?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘She’s sharp,’ </span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Ryo
thought. Next to her, An was using the sleeves of her shirt to dry the tears on
Mariko’s face. Then both of them heard what Kanae said, looked up at her, then
turned their attention on him, their eyes troubled by the same question.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes, there is a catch,” he admitted. He could feel
the large dining room becoming so quiet they would probably hear the sound of a
needle falling to the floor. “The only condition is that Mariko will have to
stay in the hospital for one full year so that the researchers can collect data
on her recovery. Every patient must agree to that if they wish to receive
treatment.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh, it’s not really a catch, is it?” Kanae burst into
laughter, tension draining from her face. “It’s not like they wanted to you
sell them your soul or anything. Just one year of staying in the </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">U.S.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> is no biggie....” She stopped abruptly as soon as she
looked in the other two girls’ direction and saw that they had fallen deathly
still. A light of comprehension dawned on Kanae’s youthful face. All three of
them had realized the only one drawback of this gracious offer from beyond the
sea, which was the fact that An was not going to be able to see Mariko, or stay
by her side, for one full year. Ryo didn’t know what Mariko was thinking... but
he could almost read the thoughts that were whirling around in the child’s
mind. To a person who was possessive of the one she loved like An, it was a
fate not quite unlike death.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

sheltered her from the heavy rain that was plummeting upon the streets of </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Tokyo</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">, couldn’t seem to be able to lift yesterday’s events
from her mind. She sighed. Perhaps it would have been better off for her had
she stayed home the night before and ordered pizza instead of accepting
Ryo-san’s invitation to dinner at his house. That way, she wouldn’t have had to
learn the truth about her friends’ relationship. That way... she wouldn’t have
had to see how much it pained An to know that her girlfriend’s recovery was
going to cost her a price perhaps much higher than what she could possibly pay.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanae sighed. Once Ryo-san had finished announcing
that piece of devastating news, An had sat there in dead silence and looked
like someone whose life had just been sucked out of her. She recovered quickly,
though. After a few minutes, the high school freshman was once again all smiles
as though it didn’t bother her at the very least. Kanae got to admit that An
was a good actress... but she wasn’t that good, really. No matter how hard she
tried to pretend to be cheerful, she couldn’t fool the people who sat around
her at the table. An’s foster father surely didn’t believe her the way he
looked at her with an agonized and guilty look on his face. Mariko, who should
know more about An than any other person in the world, certainly didn’t buy it
the way she gazed at An quietly with teary eyes for a moment before she excused
herself to go to the bathroom, alone, without An’s help. As for Kanae, she said
nothing and kept her opinion to herself. The rest of that evening was spent
sitting in the living room of the Sakuma household and playing Poker with three
people who didn’t pay much attention on the cards in their hands. Kanae ended
up winning almost every game as a result.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanae sighed again. An shouldn’t have tried to hide
her thoughts so hard. Although Ryo-san and Kanae weren’t as close to the high
school freshman as Mariko was, they were more than capable of guessing just
exactly what An was thinking in that situation. An must have been dying inside,
obviously, for she was well aware that she was going to spend one whole year
without Mariko by her side. Of course, one could argue that the two of them
could still meet online, in The World, like they usually did... but really, it
was very much similar to drinking sea water to quench one’s thirst. Besides,
Kanae doubted they were going to let Mariko bring a computer into a hospital
just because she wanted to play The World.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Well, perhaps other people would find it hard to
understand how one year of separation could affect Shouji An so greatly... but
only because they didn’t know what kind of person the girl was, or how much
Mariko meant to her. Back in The World, Mariko was the sole reason why An kept
on fighting to return to reality. Now that they had become lovers, perhaps it
was no exaggeration to say that An’s world revolved around Mariko alone. The
latter, wise beyond her years, was deeply concerned about this fact. During
their conversation yesterday, Mariko once confessed that she had realized An
was growing more emotionally attached to her than ever. Although it made the
young woman very happy, her skin still crawled whenever she thought of what was
going to happen to An should something befall the former. Kanae had shivered
hearing those very words.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanae’s heart went out to An, in any case. The girl,
no matter how selfish she was, knew that Mariko’s treatment had the highest
priority. That was why she only showed the others the happiness that was
brought to her by the medical offer and hid within her heart the grief caused
by the news that Mariko was going to leave for a place she couldn’t possibly
follow. It was going to be one long and torturous year for An. Kanae had never
had a girlfriend, or boyfriend for that matter, during the first fifteen years
of her life... but she could imagine how it would feel to be half a world away
from the one she loved. And knowing An’s temperamental and clingy personality,
the girl had to feel ten times as much. Poor girl.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Still, it wasn’t as if An would be left alone in this
world anyway. Mariko might be off all the way in the U.S.... but Kanae would
still be there for An as long as the girl needed her. That had to help in
lifting the high school freshman’s solitude... right? Kanae stopped abruptly in
front of a large video store, on the front of which hung a large poster that
showed a couple standing in each other’s embrace, lips an inch apart. For some
reason, the poster drew her attention the way magnets did iron. She found her
eyes glued at the laminated piece of paper, and at the faces of the couple, who
were gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes. Her mind began to wander... and an
image popped up in her head. It was what she had seen when she walked past the
open door of An’s room yesterday. It was what had made her drop her fruit tray
onto the ground and hurriedly retreat from the room as though hell was on her
heels. It was the scene of An and Mariko lip-locking on the bed. Except that...
for some reason... Mariko’s face began to fade... and Kanae’s own appeared in
its place instead.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She gave a violent start that nearly dropped the
umbrella from her hand. Her cheeks suddenly became so hot that she was under
the impression that if a drop of rain fell on her face, it would be instantly
vaporized. She peeled her eyes off of the poster and glared at the ground as
though it was the cause of her perverted thought.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Kanae gave her head a thorough shake. She shouldn’t
wallow in denial anymore. The fact that she liked An more than just a friend
was but obvious. She had realized it as soon as she saw the girl kiss Mariko
yesterday, for that moment was also the one in which she felt her heart
clenching. Her suspicion was confirmed during her conversation with the
paraplegic young woman, who had told Kanae how she and An became lovers and how
happy she was once they started going out. Kanae, of course, was glad that her
friends had found the happiness that they deserved... but at the same time she
couldn’t help but feel jealous toward Mariko and wish that she had been in the young
woman’s place. It had disturbed her so.... Yet, it wasn’t as if she was madly
in love with An or anything. In time, her childish crush – she <i>hoped</i> it
was just a childish crush – would fade and return her life to what it once was.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sighing one last time, Kanae folded her umbrella and
stepped into the movie rental store. Although the rain clouds had curtained the
heavens and invited darkness to encompass everything in sight, it was still
just two in the afternoon on a Sunday. And Kanae had nothing to do for the rest
of the afternoon and the evening. She might as well rent a few movies so she
could chase away the boredom that had been haunting her since Friday night, she
thought. Well... she guessed she should have gone back to the local rental
store... but that store was really small, and it didn’t carry as many titles as
Kanae hoped it would. This store, however, looked much bigger than the one near
her house, and it wasn’t that far away anyways, so why shouldn’t she take a
chance?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Welcome,” Kozuka Hiroyuki spoke perfunctorily as soon
as he heard the electric bell chiming and announcing that someone had stepped
past the door to the shop. When he looked up from his Megami Magazine, which
was laid upon the circulation desk at the far end of the room, he found a
teenaged girl with dark hair that fell to her shoulders and a slightly bored
expression on her youthful face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hi,” said Hiroyuki’s young customer as she placed her
dripping umbrella in the racket that sat near the entrance to the store. After
that, she walked to the nearest aisle, where the newest releases were shelved,
and started to inspect the empty DVD cases one by one with great interest.
Since he didn’t care enough to make sure each and every minor who walked into
this store wouldn’t sneak into the adult section, as his manager had drilled
into him over and over, Hiroyuki returned his attention to his favorite
magazine and feasted his eyes upon the screenshots and reviews of the latest
anime. Every time he looked up to check on the girl, though, he would find her
standing in a different place, and there would be another DVD case added to the
stack that she was carrying. A couple of minutes after he had glanced her way
last, the girl walked to the far end of the room and placed on top of the circulation
desk half a dozen cases, all of them anime titles.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“This many?” Hiroyuki blinked at his unusual customer.
He had never seen someone who wanted to rent so many titles at once ever since
he started to work part-time in this rental store. “Miss, are you aware that
these titles are new, so you have to return them the next day to avoid being
charged extra?” He pointed his finger at a small piece of note that was glued
on the front of each of the DVD case, which said almost the same thing as what
he just did.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yup, I saw that,” the girl answered, her brown eyes,
slightly tinged by annoyance, regarding him curiously. “What about it?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Nothing.” Hiroyuki shrugged. He seriously doubted
that she could finish so many titles before this store closed down tomorrow...
but who was he to say anything if people wanted to waste their money anyways?
“Can I have your Membership card, miss?” He extended his left hand to the girl
while his right one entered a few commands into the computer. The default blue
ALTIMIT desktop screen was instantly replaced by the interface of the program
that recorded every rental operation in the shop.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Don’t have one,” she said. “It’s the first time I’m
here.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah, I see,” he replied nonchalantly. “I’m afraid
you’d have to apply for one. It’s free, though. Would you like to do that?” </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sure.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Will you fill out this form for me?” Hiroyuki pulled
a piece of paper and a pen from the drawer under the desk and placed it in
front of the girl. “And I’ll need your government-issued ID, too,” he added.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay,” was what she muttered before she took up the
pen and started scribbling on the paper.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Hiroyuki was pondering whether he should just wait for
her to finish or read the rest of current page in the magazine when the
electric bell chimed again.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oy, Hiro,” greeted the newcomer, who was a lanky
young man with short spiky hair and a broken nose. The guy’s name was Shimatani
Kouta, Hiroyuki’s neighbor, his childhood friend, and also his former online
gaming buddy. Hiroyuki sighed. He believed he knew just exactly why the man
went all the way to this store. It wasn’t the first time he was approached
during the last week, of course.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“If you came here to talk about the same thing you did
yesterday, you’ve wasted your time and effort. The answer’s still <i>‘No’</i>,”
Hiroyuki said in a flat tone. The scribbling sound his only customer was making
just a second ago ceased abruptly. He could even feel the girl’s brown eyes on
him. He paid her no mind. it was not as if they were discussing top-secret
stuff anyway.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh come on, don’t say that,” said Kouta, who
scratched the back of his head in embarrassment. The guy was transparent and as
easily to read as an open book, he just didn’t know it. “We need you in the
game, man.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Hiroyuki glanced at the only girl in the store and
found himself being studied openly by his target. She appeared interested as
soon as she heard Kouta utter that word “game”, so he couldn’t help but wonder
if she was a gamer, too.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s the ten thousandth time you said it to me.”
Hiroyuki sighed in exasperation. “Shouldn’t you have realized that you can’t
change my mind? I’ve lost interest in The World, Kouta.” The instant he
mentioned the name of the famous MMORPG was also the one in which he heard a
sharp intake of breath from his young customer. There was no doubt about it.
She was a gamer, and she was playing The World.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“But what about your sense of justice and order?”
Kouta said pleadingly. “You were devoted to the team before, weren’t you? We
know how much you loved what you did. Why won’t you join us again? We need
someone who can help us put the Player Killers in line. Someone like you,
Captain!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You overestimated me,” replied Hiroyuki calmly. “You
can find a better leader amongst the old members, I’m sure. Besides, I need a
life, Kouta. Look at me, I’m twenty-three and I have no steady income, no car,
no girlfriend. Some people would call me lame.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Just admit it, Hiro,” said Kouta crossly. Hiroyuki
could tell that perhaps his unwavering decision had finally managed to tick his
childhood friend off. “You don’t play the game anymore because Subaru isn’t
there anymore, right?” accused the man. “Get over that good-for-nothing
hypocrite already! She isn’t worth it.” </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Hiroyuki felt his face hardening. “You take that
back,” he snapped. “How dare a Crimson Knight like you speak that way about
your leader?” Kouta was about to shout back something when Hiroyuki rode right
over him, his voice growing louder and louder by every word, “I won’t stand
here and hear you calling Lady Subaru names, got it? Now get out of here!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In front of the circulation desk Shimatani Kouta
stood, face a thunderhead, eyes going as wide as they could in anger, clenched
fist trembling at his sides. Then he spun on his heel and stormed out of the
store, leaving behind his umbrella. Hiroyuki sighed. The other man was always
short-tempered. He’d cool down in time, though. Maybe the cold of the rain
would help quicken that process. He was sure that when he saw Kouta tomorrow,
the man would already have forgotten about what just happened, though.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry you had to see this, Miss. I apologize...”
he said as he turned toward his customer. He stopped talking, however, when his
eyes fell on her face and saw that she was smiling the way someone did when
they had uncovered a secret.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re Silver Knight!” she exclaimed... and he gave a
start. How the heck did she guess?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As if she were able to read his mind, she grinned and
said, “You worked in a movie rental store. You addressed Subaru as “Lady”. And
that man called you Captain! Isn’t it obvious?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Do I know you?” Hiroyuki peered at the teenager. “In
The World, I mean.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes you do, now guess who I am.” She gave him a
mischievous smile.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Hiroyuki decided to study the girl more carefully
while going over what she had said in his head. Then it struck him.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re Mimiru,” he said. She was the only person in
The World to whom he divulged the information about him working part-time for a
movie rental store. It had to be her. “But you’re... so young. I thought you
had to be at least eighteen.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“And you’re so old,” Mimiru retaliated. “I already
knew that you had to be an old man from the way you talked and acted in The
World but I didn’t imagine that you were already twenty-three!”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Hiroyuki cleared his throat and offered no comment to
that. Twenty-three was <i>old?</i> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What’s your name?” she asked. “I can’t keep calling
you Silver Knight or grumpy old man, can I?”</span></p>

“Shouldn’t you be introducing yourself to your elder first?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Fine.” She stuck her tongue out at him. “I’m Kanae,
Mitsuki Kanae. Nice to meet’cha.” She extended her hand to him. He took it and
gave it a firm shake.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“My name’s Kozuka Hiroyuki,” he said. “Glad to make
your acquaintance.”</span></p>

you a question.”</span></p>

laugh together. She was an interesting girl, Hiroyuki decided. And if the
rumors he had heard were true, she should be chummy with the Lady Subaru
herself. Maybe he could ask the girl about his former leader. It had been a
while since he last heard about her, after all.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Standing by the whiteboard of the room three-oh-eight of
Touyou Eiwa Jogakuin, Rikudou Emi tossed a glance over her shoulder as her hand
continued to use a piece of square cloth to wipe the remaining of the board.
Beyond the glass windows, the sun was traveling toward the horizon, its light
dyeing every desk and chair in the classroom with its sickly orange light. In
the approaching twilight, Shouji An, a tall girl with soft brown hair and a
pair of bright eyes of the color of amber, sat on her chair with her elbows on
her desk like a lifeless statue. Her face, which was as blank as a sheet of
paper often enough, was now covered by an aura of melancholy. Emi couldn’t help
but wonder what the black sheep of the class was thinking in that head of hers.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Since starting her first grade in this school, Emi had
been assuming the post of class representative. Yet, during the last ten years
of her life, she had never encountered someone nearly as troublesome as the
ever-so-aloof Shouji An in her class. Well, not troublesome in the sense that
Shouji was a nuisance to other people around her – she never was – but in that
the girl made Emi’s job infinitely difficult to carry out. She was the class
rep, who was implored upon by the homeroom teacher to ensure that the students
get along as well as family members would, so it was only natural that she
tried to pull Shouji into the lukewarm and friendly atmosphere that she had
spent ten years to create and maintain. The brown-haired girl, one year older
than every other person in the tenth grade, elected not to. Emi wasn’t pleased
in the very least.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Every time Shouji An stepped into the class, she
immediately walked to her seat in the very last row and began to stare out of
the glass window to her right without sparing any of her classmates a smile, a
good morning greeting, or even a quickest glance. Shouji wasn’t snobbish or
anything, that Emi could tell, she was simply uninterested in other people or
whatever they did around her seat. Although she did respond when other students
approached her – the girls who were Shouji’s neighbors wanted to make friends
with her, Emi supposed – she did so in a manner that encouraged people to stay
the heck away from her. It wasn’t that she was rude – nor was she polite, in
any case – the way she answered people’s questions let them know exactly that
they should stop bothering her and let her be by herself. Her classmates got
the message almost instantly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Emi <i>tsk’ed</i> in irritation as she recalled the
first conversation she had with Shouji An, which happened during the lunch
break of the first day she transferred into the class. All Emi had wanted to do
was letting Shouji  know that although she was new and that everybody else
in the class knew each other – they had actually been friends since the first
grade, thanks to the escalator system – she shouldn’t hesitate in making
friends. Emi had said so as warmly and affably as she could, which usually
helped her break the ice successfully, so she was shocked when she was met with
a blank stare in the end and a curt “Thank you” before Shouji turned away and
resuming her prior activity, which involved staring at the clouds through the
window.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Of course, being the kind class representative that
Emi was, she didn’t become angry. Instead, she tried to talk to her
unresponsive classmate again and tried her best to learn more about the girl by
asking questions involving her family. Five minutes after she started, Shouji
An stood up and walked out of the class. Another five minutes passed before Emi
realized that her target had settled herself down on the ground beneath a tree
in the school yard, her arms hugging her knees, her eyes gazing once more
upward at the sky. Only after the school bell rang did the girl return to
class. Emi found herself thinking that Shouji An was a challenge that she could
not, and must not, fail to overcome.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">With that incident – Emi sometimes referred to it as a
Public Relations disaster – in mind, she had assumed that it would be
impossible to ask Shouji An to join a club, which was required by the school.
At first, Shouji reacted the way Emi thought she would when the girl was
informed about the school’s regulation, which meant that she gave Emi a bland
look before she muttered a half-hearted “Thank you” and stared out of her
window again. Then just as Emi was about to leave, Shouji suddenly asked in a
drop-dead serious voice whether Touyou Eiwa Jogakuin had a movie club. That
surprised her so greatly she spent a good two minutes gaping at Shouji An like
a country lout before she gave the latter the directions to the club.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Now here was the oddest thing that had ever happened
in Touyou Eiwa as far back as Emi could remember. Since she was terribly
curious about Shouji An, she dropped by the movie club a few times to see how
the girl was doing. She was shocked the moment she realized that despite
Shouji’s unresponsiveness, the girl was fawned on by nearly every member of the
club. When she carefully made an inquiry into the matter, a sempai answered her
that they couldn’t help but wanting to spoil the girl because it had been a
while since they managed to recruit a talent like the freshman... and that they
thought Shouji was the cutest thing in the world. Emi simply couldn’t
understand what was wrong with that crazy club anymore.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Snapping out of her recollection of the past, Emi
sighed and finished cleaning up the whiteboard. She was about to go pick up her
bag and leave the moment the classroom’s door slid open and admitted someone in
a getup she never expected to see in Touyou Eiwa. It was a young woman in her
mid-twenties, about five feet six in height, with short hair that fell in
ringlets in front of her forehead and on either side of her face, which Emi
judged to be not quite pretty but not exactly unattractive either. Standing in
grave black business attire and wearing a gram face that brooked no nonsense,
the newcomer was the very picture of propriety and strength of will. Yet, when
Emi looked into the woman’s eyes, gray augers that seemed more than able to
bore through the hardest material, she knew that this kind of person would do anything
as long as it gained her the desired result. Emi shivered.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Excuse me,” said the woman, “may I speak to
Shouji-san, please?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh,” Emi swallowed audibly, “she’s over there.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Thank you.” The woman gave a small incline of her
head, to which Emi returned a deeper one of her own. When she straightened up
again, the woman was already walking toward Shouji An, who was studying the
newcomer with a frown on her face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hello,” said the woman upon arriving at Shouji’s
desk. “My name is Minamoto Iriya, and I have come on behalf of CyberConnect
Corporation. Say, Shouji-san, would you like to go for something to drink? I
have an offer that you may just be interested in.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The frown on the brown-haired girl’s face deepened
while Minamoto Iriya’s lips curved upward into a smile Emi could only call...
vicious. She wondered if she should find the nearest teacher and report this
incident to them.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sitting at a table right next to the glass storefront of
Hayamu’s Coffee House, which was actually more of a bakery shop than what it
was named for, Shouji An silently studied the austere facial features of the
woman who sat opposite her. As ever, every table of the shop, atop which sat
dishfuls of delicious sweet cakes and cups of billowing tea, was occupied. As
far as An could remember, there hadn’t been a day in which the establishment of
Okada Hayamu-san, the gray-haired elderly gentleman who was the House’s owner,
wasn’t crowded. Even now, there was still a long line of people who were
waiting outside the door, waiting anxiously for the moment they could step in
and relax themselves with Okada-san’s homemade cakes and homebrew coffee and
tea. Yet, even in the din that encompassed the entire shop, amidst the loud
chattering of the female students of Touyou Eiwa Jogakuin who hung out here
after class every afternoon without caring about the amount of sugar they were
accumulating into their bodies, An had the impression that a bubble of silence
surrounded her and her companion, who exuded a very disquieting atmosphere at
times. Many thought An naïve, but she had no difficulty identifying Minamoto
Iriya as someone utterly dangerous. As for what someone like the young woman
could have wanted with a high school student, An didn’t know.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She intended to find out, though.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You called me out here,” she said in a cool voice to
Minamoto, who had been staring at her with an interested expression on her face
since the start, “shouldn’t you be talking?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah, yes, indeed so,” answered the woman. “Shouji-san,
it is my understanding that you had spent a long period of time in a hospital
more than two months ago, correct? In a vegetative state, I believe?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Right.” An gave a curt nod.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The more she listened to Minamoto Iriya, who
introduced herself as the director of the Public Relations Department of CC
Corp, the more uncomfortable she grew. Perhaps it was a very wrong decision to
have let her curiosity win over common sense and drag her out here with the
woman. She should have been back in her room, packing up her belongings so that
she’d be ready when dad came and picked her up, so that she could spend her
Saturday and Sunday at home, where she could stay near her beloved
girlfriend.... <i>‘Before she flies away to America and leaves me here alone,’</i>
she thought in deep sadness. An wondered if it was already too late to walk out
of the door of the shop and pretend that Minamoto never approached her....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Are you aware of the cause?” the woman asked before
she quietly took a sip from her coffee cup.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes,” replied An. “What’s so important about it that
you had to seek me out?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why, everything!” Minamoto made it sound the most
obvious thing in the world. “Do you not see, Shouji-san? The fact that your consciousness,”
faster than An could react, the older woman raised her hand and pressed her
forefinger against An’s forehead, “can leave your body and enter the imaginary
space created by a network of computers is something incredible!” An brushed
away almost roughly the hand of the self-proclaimed director of the Public
Relations Department. She hated being touched by people she barely knew. “My
apologies.” Minamoto inclined her head. If she was offended, she hid it well.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What exactly do you want with me?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What <i>we</i> at CyberConnect wish to <i>discuss</i>
with you,” she said, “is a job offer. Shouji-san, would you like to work for us
as a test subject for out newest Virtual Reality System? We have high hopes for
it, as we expect it to be the key factor in revolutionizing The World and the
Cyber world itself.” The woman’s gray eyes, cold as winter stone from the
moment she approached An in her class, suddenly glowed with a mix of excitement
and reverence. From a distance, anybody would have guessed that Minamoto was a
devout Christian who was raving about her Almighty God. “Would it not be
incredible if we succeeded in safely transferring people’s consciousness into
the game? Would it not be a joy for true gamers to experience the game world
the way they do the <i>real</i> world?” </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why me?” An asked curtly. “There are millions of
people in Tokyo alone. Why do you want <i>me</i>?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We have been trying with others before we decided
that we should approach you, Shouji-san,” Minamoto Iriya said patiently. “Our
experiments, however, proved to be unfruitful. No matter what we did, the
system rejected our subjects the very same way magnets of the same pole
repelled each other. It was only then did we think of you.” The woman’s eyes
sparkled with a light that sent shivers slithering down An’s spine. “You were
the first person to fall under the influence of that renegade A.I. Morgana. You
were the one whose consciousness spent the longest period of time in The World.
If our conjecture was indeed correct, the system should welcome you with open
arms.” She spread her hands and smiled. “So, what say you, Shouji-san?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I refuse,” An said flatly. “I have better things to
do than being your lab rat.” She rose to her feet.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Don’t leave yet.” The smile on Minamoto’s lips
deepened. “We have not even talked about the benefits of working for us yet.”
She reached inside her suit pocket and brought out a folded piece of paper,
which she straightened out upon the table top. “This is the contract. Why don’t
you read it and see for yourself what we can offer in exchange for your
cooperation?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Not interested, so no thanks.” An picked up her
schoolbag and started for the exit of the Coffee House. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How is Lady Subaru of the Crimson Knights doing
lately?” Minamoto Iriya’s voice spoke softly behind An and made her stop
abruptly in her track. “We at CyberConnect were truly sorry to see the Knights
disbanded, you see,” the young woman continued while An stared at her. “We have
always been indebted to her; for without her and her Knights, The World would
have been a place where lawlessness thrived while we could do nothing to stop
it.” Gray eyes now focused on An, strong as a snow avalanche, sharper than a
butcher’s knife. For some reason, those eyes infuriated An no end.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why did you mention her?” she asked in her coldest
voice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Because I believe this modest offer will benefit both
you <i>and</i> her, of course. Say, Shouji-san, is it true that Lady Subaru is
going to the United States for her treatment?” the woman said, her smile
unwavering atop her interlaced hands.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“How do you know that?” An felt her fists clenching
and her internal organs turning to ice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We always do our homework; that is why. Why don’t you
sit down? We at CyberConnect have spent much time and effort trying to devise a
contract that would delight you. At least read it, please? Else, we may have to
resort to appealing to the Lady Subaru herself.” The threat, however disguised
by polite and honeyed words, was plain. Unless An did what they wanted, Mariko
would be endangered. For the first time ever since she walked into this coffee
shop, An realized that she had been caught in a trap that had no easy way out.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

open the doors to Hayamu’s Coffee House and scanned the interior for his
adopted daughter. When he spotted the girl, his breath caught immediately.
Shouji An, sitting at a table by the transparent large glass panel that
served  as the storefront, opposite a woman in grave business attire, was
holding in her hand the personal seal that was required for any legal
documents. And she was about to press the seal upon a piece of paper lying atop
the table while the older woman smiled at her in great satisfaction.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Hold it, An!” he roared and ended up making nearly
everybody else in the shop jump off their seats, including An and her
companion. Shocked by Ryo’s voice, the brown-haired girl let go of the seal in
her hand and let it fall all the way to the carpeted floor of the shop. The
woman in business suit, whose nerves must have been made from steel the way she
was unfazed by the commotion that he caused, looked up calmly at him. Yet, in
those gray eyes of her hid a light that spoke volumes of hatred. She seemed a
tigress whose prey had just been stolen and was determined to reclaim it. Ryo
decided immediately that this woman was dangerous.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Being fully aware that every eye there was in the shop
was glued at him, Ryo walked to An’s table, where he stood and stared down at
the woman with his coldest face. Perhaps she realized that having a man looming
over her like this made her look feeble, she rose to her feet and returned a
stare that was no less challenging.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You must be the lady from CC Corp. I’ve heard about,”
Ryo said coolly. “My name’s Sakuma Ryo, An’s guardian. Pleased to meet you.” He
extended his hand to the woman, who grabbed it and shook it as firmly as any
other man would. She looked puny... but she sure was strong.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I am Minamoto Iriya,” she said, her hand letting go
of Ryo’s. “It is my pleasure.” The shadow of a raging blizzard never disappeared
from her gray eyes. Minamoto must be secretly steaming inside, he guessed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">He glanced at his adopted daughter, who was sitting
very still on her seat, face painted with surprise and puzzlement. Sighing, he
bent down to pick up her personal seal and slipped it back into her hand. The
girl never said a word even as he pulled her up gently by the wrist and said
quietly, “Let’s go back to your room, An. Mariko’s waiting there, and she’s
very worried about you.” The name of An’s girlfriend brought a guilty grimace
to the high school’s freshman’s face. Ryo wondered why.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> “I’m sorry I interrupted your <i>meeting</i>,”
he glanced at the woman from CC Corp, “but we have an urgent matter to attend
to. Perhaps we can schedule an appointment on another day for the <i>three</i>
of us?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Certainly,” Minamoto Iriya said as she folded the
piece of paper on the desk, put it inside her suit pocket, and gave An and Ryo
an incline of her head. “Good day.” She then walked to the cashier counter, gave
the elderly lady over there a few bills, and left.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Shall we go?” he quietly told the brown-haired girl.
She nodded.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why is Mariko here, dad?” An asked, her voice
slightly anxious, when they were crossing the school yard a few minutes later.
“And... how did you find me?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mariko asked me to let her tag along when I came to
pick you up like usual,” Ryo replied. “Saying that she was worried is an
understatement. It would appear you haven’t been calling her, <i>again</i>.” He
gave his daughter a glance, which made her turn her head sideways in guilt. “On
the way here, I received a call from my old friend the Headmistress of Touyou
Eiwa. Thanks to your vigilant class representative, she learned that someone
suspicious from CyberConnect had approached you. After taking that phone call,
I left Mariko in your room went to look for you. As to how I found you... have
you forgotten, An? Your mobile has a GPS tracking device.” Ryo gestured at her
school bag, in which he knew her cell phone had to be.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah, right,” the brown-haired girl murmured
noncommittally.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">A few minutes passed in silence between them before
they reached An’s room in the dorm.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An,” Misono Mariko, sitting on her wheelchair near
the bed, called softly as soon as Ryo opened the door and ushered in the high
school fresh man, who seemed as though she wanted to be on a different planet.
Mariko noticed this, for the young woman’s face paled a little bit. “An, did
something happen?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> Not answering her girlfriend’s question, An
stood stiffly by the door and took up a serious study of the floor.
Exasperated, Mariko turned her gaze toward Ryo and looked at him pleadingly.
Sighing, Ryo sat down on the bed and raked his fingers through his hair, not
knowing how he should begin. Silence, terribly uncomfortable silence, weighed
on his shoulders like a boulder of rock until he could stand it no more.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An, would you tell me what the woman from CC Corp
wanted from you?” he suggested. “Please?” Not that he didn’t know... but he had
better confirm it first.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Another few minutes passed before An decided to speak
up. In a strained voice, the brown-haired girl gave them the details of their
meeting. She stopped abruptly, however, upon reaching the part about her
reading the contract and refused to speak more. He noticed her reluctance. He
would have inquired further, too, had something in An’s story not struck him
like a full-arm slap. Anger rose in him.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“So she threatened you with Mariko, didn’t she?” Ryo’s
voice was soft and low, but inside his veins coursed torrential currents of
molten lava. He was born mild-natured, but this was just plain outrageous!
“I’ll call the authorities soon.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh An....” Mariko wheeled herself forward and stopped
in front of her young girlfriend. There, she took the hands of the high school
freshman into hers and squeezed them affectionately.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An, next you see that woman, don’t ever let her get
near you. She meant you no good,” Ryo said. “In fact, that job offer from CC
Corp could have been the most dangerous trap you could possibly land yourself
into.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What do you mean, Ryo-san?” Mariko asked. An, on the
other hand, only gave him a puzzled look.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sure you both remember Helba,” he answered and
continued after An and Mariko had nodded, “that wise lady has been keeping a tight
watch on both The World and CC Corp even after Morgana’s defeat. When I was in
the game yesterday, I received a message from her, which requested my presence
at a meeting in a hidden Field. When I arrived, I saw her, Balmung, and Lios.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Pausing to take a breath, Ryo silently watched as the
girls’ eyes widened in surprise at the names he had mentioned. They both knew
that Lios was the CC Corp. Administrator who had sided with the dotHackers in
the war against Morgana and her Phases. Furthermore, they were also aware that
Balmung of the Azure Sky had been made Administrator of the game. The fact that
the famous hacker Helba and two Administrators summoned him to a secret meeting
should be a sign that something terrible was going on.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Lord Balmung was there, too?” Mariko said quietly,
almost a musing, as a frown formed on her pretty face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Balmung said that he would have called you too,
Mariko, had he not realized that he didn’t want to drag you into the mess ever
again.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“He’s always so kind,” the paraplegic young woman
murmured in gratitude. Ryo nodded to himself. Of course, Balmung of the Azure
Sky had always been protective over Mariko. In a way, he was like a father to
her, who watched over her in the shadows, who silently ensured that no harm
would fall her way. A good man, that was what Balmung was.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Anyways,” Ryo cleared his throat and decided to get
back to the important matter at hand, “in the meeting, Helba, Balmung, and Lios
informed me of a danger lurking in the shadows of CC Corp. You see, since the
company learned of the existence of Aura, Morgana, and what happened to An in
The World, a faction within the personnel has been formed. The members of that
faction, called the Revolutionists reverently by some and mockingly by others,
advocated idea which was fed to you by the woman Minamoto Iriya, An. A perfect
Virtual Reality where the player’s consciousness is immersed in the game so
that they can experience the true sensations they would normally feel in the
real world.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“At first, when the idea was first voiced, it gained
enormous support from the leaders. However, once they took a careful inspection
over the design that the Revolutionists wished to implement on the current
systems, they found out a detrimental flaw. The design, despite its brilliance
and intricacy, would place an immense stress upon the player’s mind, which was
more than capable of sending him or her into a coma... or shut it down forever.
Apparently, some researchers with too much time on their hands have been
studying the remnants of Morgana’s data.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An and Mariko stared at Ryo in shock.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“As a result, the big shots in CC Corp. decided to put
the idea on a back burner until the flaw in the design was fixed. They refuse
to grant budget to the researchers, too,” he continued. “The Revolutionists
weren’t pleased with that. They argued that without being given priority and
budget to continue their result, how could they overcome the problem? Since the
higher-ups would hear none of it, the Revolutionists could only fume in
silence... until they decided that they would take the matter into their own
hands. Determined, they set out to look for test subjects, which had <i>never</i>
been authorized.” His lips thinned in anger. “Thanks to those Revolutionists,
five adults have been sent to hospital, all of whom were in a short comma
before gaining consciousness in special recuperation rooms. Worse, they hadn’t
been able to twitch a muscle ever since, as their brain cells were heavily
damaged. <i>That</i> could have happened to you, An,” he declared firmly, trying
to drive his point home.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko’s hand rose to cover her mouth in horror, her
eyes as wide as they could be, while Ryo’s daughter’s complexion went so pale
one could have thought that all the blood had been withdrawn from her face. Her
hands, which were hanging very still at her side since the beginning of the
conversation, started to tremble. Ryo believed he had just succeeded in
slamming fear back into her mind.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Afterwards, the Revolutionists, fearful of the
consequences, threatened the families of the victims that unless they kept
quiet, they would be killed,” Ryo said. “That was how they managed to keep
their CC Corp. superiors in the dark. Fortunately, however, Helba found out
about the incident and immediately notified Balmung and Lios. Those three would
have exposed the shady business to the executive personnel at CC Corp., I
believe, had it not been for the fact that Helba deeply mistrusts them, that
Lios and Balmung’s positions weren’t very high, and that they possess no
evidence at all. Balmung and Lios promised to investigate further into the
matter, though.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why did they contact you of all people, Ryo-san?”
Mariko asked, her voice a tad breathless.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Because they had cause to believe that the
Revolutionists would come after An, seeing how much she was connected to
Morgana and The World,” Ryo replied and gave his daughter a glance. She shied
back as though his eyes were bullets. “And I see that they were correct. An,”
the brown-haired girl gave a start at the mentioning of her name and looked up
at him in apprehension, “now will you tell me why you decided to print your
seal on that contract?” Having heard the question, the high school freshman
eyed the door to her room and appeared as though she wanted to break it down so
she could escape.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An, did they threaten you again?” Mariko supplied.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An shook her head and said slowly, “No, I was trying
to sign that contract because I wanted to.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why do you <i>want</i> to?” Ryo demanded, frowning.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An swallowed audibly and turned her sideways, lips
thinned, blue eyes boring a hole through a wall standing opposite. She
obviously didn’t want to answer. Ryo was about to pressure her to spill the
reason why she would do something that, based on her personality and her unease
toward CC Corp., would not do under normal circumstances when Mariko said in a
soft, pleading voice, “An, please, talk to us.” Then the girl turned around.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“They... promised me fifty million yen in exchange for
my cooperation,” the brown-haired girl said in a quiet and ashamed voice. “They
said... it’d be enough to fund my stay in the United States during the one year
Mariko’s hospitalized.” After she finished, she stood there and trembled as
though she had just been tossed into a winter pond.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Deafening silence once again descended in the room and
engulfed the three of them. Ryo was so shocked that he couldn’t find a word to
say while Mariko stared at her lover, her amber eyes shining with unshed tears.
An, on the other hand, never stopped trembling. She seemed on the verge of
tears, too. Seeing her like that, Ryo could only blame himself and his
uselessness. He only wished that he had more money. He only wished his
financial situation hadn’t deteriorated so much lately that he didn’t have the
power to make his daughter happy. Sure, outwardly the novelist Sakuma Ryo was
wealthy but he and his daughter knew better than that. Unless his novel, which
was still in writing, was successful, they would run into a financial crisis
soon enough.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Come here, An,” Mariko said softly and tugged at An’s
hand with her own. At first, the high school freshman refused to move but when
she looked at the young woman’s face, she gave in and got down on her knees in
front of the wheelchair. “You must have suffered a great deal during the last
week. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, An.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No, don’t apologize!” An gave a start. “I’m the one
at fault. I shouldn’t be so selfish I made you worry. I’m the one who should
say sorry. I should have been overjoyed just to know that you have a chance of
being cured. I... I....”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You don’t have to say anything. There’s nothing you
should be sorry for.” Mariko hushed her young girlfriend by pulling the latter
into a tight hug. In Mariko’s embrace, Ryo’s daughter started to cry. Knowing
he shouldn’t stay anymore, he hastily opened the door stepped out of the room.
Yet, quick as he was, he wasn’t quick enough to close the door in time so he
wouldn’t hear a quiet <i>“I love you, An,”</i> issued from Mariko’s mouth. His
fists clenched as he leaned his back against the door. Any other person perhaps
could undergo a year without her love by her side... but he doubted An could
without sinking deeper and deeper into depression first. In that instant, he
decided that by any means, he would gather enough money so that he could send
An to the U.S. with Mariko, no matter what he had to do to achieve his goal.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Under the camouflage of the night and the shadow of a
tall building, Minamoto Iriya quietly observed the two-story house that was the
home to Sakuma Ryo and his adopted daughter, Shouji An. The two of them had
come back here a while ago, accompanied by a young woman on a wheelchair that
could be no one else but the Lady Subaru, Misono Mariko. Iriya gave her lips a
thoughtful tap. From the look on their faces, painted with a touch of sadness
and frustration, she didn’t think that she should contact Shouji An ever again.
The answer became obvious to her the moment Sakuma Ryo stormed into that coffee
shop and prevented his daughter from signing that fake contract. Well, of
course it was fake, if the Revolutionists possessed fifty million yen, they
would be performing extensive researches on the Morpheus System right now, not
dispatching Minamoto Iriya and her comrades around the country to abduct test
subjects.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Iriya sighed. It was so close. Had Sakuma Ryo been a
minute later, maybe even thirty seconds, Shouji An would have become a pawn in
her hand, which she could move on the chessboard to her heart’s content. Now...
Iriya suspected that the moment she stepped near the girl was also the moment
her face was covered with the content of a pepper spray. <i>If</i> Iriya
managed to get near the girl, of course....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Well... she guessed she needed to initiate Plan B now.
Shouji An was a test subject that she could not afford letting go. By hook or
by crook, Iriya would bring the girl to the Revolutionists’ secret research
center.... The revolution of virtual reality was at hand, she and her fellow
members only needed to try a little harder. When Shouji An finished helping
them perfect the Morpheus System, the big shots in CyberConnect would open
their eyes and recognize the System for what it was worth. The world would
kneel at their feet then.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Taking out her Palm Pilot, Iriya quickly punched the
dials and pressed it against her ear. In but a few seconds, the dull ringing
sounds were replaced by the voice of one of her comrades.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Headquarters,” she said softly, “Plan A has failed.
Requesting permission to start Plan B.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Silence passed for the next few minutes before a man’s
deep voice answered her, “Permission granted.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“My thanks, friend,” was what Iriya murmured before
she hung up. Using her pen, she browsed the contact list on her phone until she
found the address of the man with whom she needed to get in touch.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“1579 Meiji Avenue, Beika City,” she murmured as she
walked away from the Sakuma residence, “Shouji Ichitaka.” If there was someone
who could deliver Shouji An into her hand, it would be her rotten scum of a
biological father. Iriya couldn’t help but chuckle softly to herself. This
world was truly a joke....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>
