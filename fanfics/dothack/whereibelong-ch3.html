<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In his run-down apartment, on a floor littered by cigarette
butts and empty beer bottles, beneath a window the glass of which was stained
by smoke and the dust that accrued after months of neglect, Shouji Ichitaka
sat, his eyes glued at the dark ceiling, his head a mess of fear and
desperation. Life had been cruel toward him during the last two days, as his
electricity, gas, and water service had been cut off due to the fact that he
had no money to pay the bills. Yet, bad as the situation was, the worst had yet
to come. A couple of days from now, the landlord would come to collect this
month’s rent... and unless Ichitaka found money in time, he was going to be
kicked out of here. Once that happened, Ichitaka would have to spend his nights
on some bench in the park, homeless, friendless, jobless, penniless, and
without a chance of regaining what he once had. He shuddered. Oh Gods above,
why did they land him into this predicament? </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Despair turned into anger. Yes, all of this was his
Gods-damned daughter’s doings. It was the girl’s bad luck that killed his wife.
It was the evil who had accompanied her since birth that led to the downfall of
his business career. When Shouji An fell into a coma and ended up in a
vegetative state, Ichitaka had thought in glee that he could finally get rid of
the disease that had plagued the last seventeen years of his life. Every day he
prayed to the Gods that the girl would kick the bucket, every day he hoped to
receive a phone call from the hospital which would inform him that his source
of misfortune no longer troubled him... and every day he was disappointed.
Apparently An refused to draw her last breath even though she was almost as
dead as a corpse. Not knowing how long he was going to have to pay the hospital
to preserve his daughter’s life, which he never wanted them to, he had tried to
pressure the girl’s assigned doctor into pulling the plug of her life-support
machine. That chicken of a physician, however, refused to, so Ichitaka was
infuriated no end.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">One day, he decided that he could wait no more, that
he had to take matters into his own hands, so he sneaked into his daughter’s
room in the hospital. There, he shut down the life-support machine and watched
in cold satisfaction as An’s pulse started to weaken. He was so close to
success, so close, when the doctor stepped into the room and discovered that
Ichitaka was trying to kill his patient. Of course, since Ichitaka was
outnumbered, he could do nothing except from watching the SVR-865X Unit coming
back to life, An’s pulse becoming stabilized, and his hope being washed down
the drain. Well, despite the fact that he was stared at disgustedly by the
doctor and nurses at the hospital, he wasn’t tossed into prison for his attempt
of vandalism and threatening a patient’s life, so he guessed Lady Luck still
favored him somewhat.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">His real trouble, as if he hadn’t had enough of it,
started, ironically, when Shouji An woke up from her coma. On that very
morning, he waited at home for the girl, knowing that the moment she stepped
one step past the door would also be the moment he grabbed her hair, like he
always did, and beat her with all his might. That afternoon, he considered the
idea of murder, for he didn’t believe he could tolerate the girl’s repulsive
existence anymore. By the time the evening descended upon the sky of </span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Tokyo</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt">, he had already figured how to dispose of his
daughter’s corpse without arousing any suspicion from the neighbors or the
police. Oh how he had been disappointed when he opened the door four days later
to see that it wasn’t the abomination who had rung the bell, but a bear of a
man who was accompanied by a lawyer in grave black suit. It was the instant
that he felt as if he had just put his head into a noose.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">That man introduced himself as Sakuma Ryo and
announced he had taken all legal actions necessary to <i>“deliver An out of the
hell hole”</i> that was Ichitaka’s beloved home. Taken aback, he could only
stare as the lawyer, a woman who looked at him the way one would filth,
presented him with the paperwork that clearly showed that he no longer had the
power to affect his daughter’s life. Not just that, according to the last sheaf
of paper in the darn woman’s folder, the Superior Court of Tokyo had also
issued a restraint order, which forbade him to approach Shouji An under any and
all circumstances. Apparently, Sakuma had brought An to the police and let her
testified that she had been subjected to both verbal and physical abuse by
Ichitaka. How his jaw had dropped knowing that had the girl pressed charge
against him, he would have been in deep yogurt.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After Sakuma and his lawyer left, Ichitaka sat back
down on his couch and became so happy that had he not tried his best not to
dance around the apartment, he would have. For the first time ever, he felt as
though a mountain had been lifted from his shoulders. <i>‘Finally, my
misfortune has left me for good,’</i> he had thought on that day and gone ahead
to buy a cask of beer just so he could celebrate his daughter’s departure from
his life. He had not slept so well since the day his wife gave birth to the
brat.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Eventually, he realized that even though Shouji An was
no longer nearby, her bad luck was still there, haunting him as tenaciously as
ever. For some reason, his neighbors, whom he was on good terms with, had
managed to listen in on the conversation between him and Sakuma Ryo, inevitably
learning of the fact that he had been punishing his daughter in his own home.
As a result, they ostracized him and treated him with contempt even though he
believed that what he did to Shouji An was but just. Well, he didn’t care so
much about those good-for-nothing slobs anyways, so he ignored them and went on
with his daily life. Never once did he imagine that the incident would get
blown up beyond his control. Never once did he expect to find a reporter at his
door one Saturday afternoon, wanting to interview him. Of course, Ichitaka
slammed the door on the fellow’s face immediately.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It was a bad idea.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The next morning, as soon as he picked up the
newspaper, he saw a picture of himself on the front page. He didn’t know
whether the reporter was just enraged by Ichitaka’s action or the guy was
determined to become famous at Ichitaka’s expense... but the damnable man had
clearly done his best to smear Ichitaka’s reputation. Aided by his <i>helpful</i>
neighbors, the reporter managed to sprinkle a few specks of truth onto his
article... yet the rest were ill-willed lies. True, he admitted that he once
beat up An so badly that he had to keep her from going to school for fear
someone would notice the bruises. True, he often showered the girl with all
sorts of profanity with the intention of forcing her to learn just exactly how
she had affected his once perfect life. True, he even tried to kill her by
disabling her life-support system... but for crying out loud, he never applied
medieval torture devices on her, nor did he starve her for such a long period
of time that the girl ended up in the hospital for weeks. It was an article
more vicious than anything he had had the chance to read in his life. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The trouble didn’t end there.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">When Ichitaka came to work a couple of days later, he
was summoned to the office of the chairman, who told him flatly that he had
been fired. It turned out that the higher-ups in the company had heard about
the incident and decided that they needed to get rid of him as soon as
possible. Since they were about to launch an advertisement campaign that was
supposed to raise their popularity with the public, they couldn’t afford
anything that might taint the company’s name. That was the simple reason to
Ichitaka’s downfall. On that day, he left a company where he thought he would
work and continue to rise until he reigned on top of everybody else.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">During the following weeks, Ichitaka sought employment
from other eminent companies. Of course, since he had such an awesome résumé, he
expected that anyone who had a little bit of sense and intelligence to leap at
him and offer him a position no lower than that of his last job. What he faced
at the interviews, unexpectedly, were rejection and disgust. The first question
they asked him was always related to the article on the newspaper in which he
was accused of child abuse. He denied it as fervently as he could, obviously,
but no matter how hard he tried, he failed to clear his name. As a result, no
company would hire him. After every day that passed afterwards, he sank a
little bit closer toward hell.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘And I must be at its door right now,’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> he thought bitterly. He only wondered when it would
open and let hell suck him in.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Just as Ichitaka was about to wallow himself deeper
and deeper in self-pity and hatred for the ungrateful world, someone knocked on
the door and made him give a violent start. Instinctively, he pressed himself
against the wall and began to tremble. The landlord... he couldn’t have decided
that he wanted to collect this month’s rent early now could he? Ichitaka dearly
wished that it wasn’t the cold-blooded, money-loving old man... but aside from
him, who would come to this Gods-forsaken apartment to look for Ichitaka? His
so-called friends had deserted him since his fall from grace and pretended that
they didn’t know him even if they saw him on the streets. Even solicitors
refused to knock on the door of his apartment, which was called a hell hole by
Sakuma Ryo and Ichitaka’s neighbors, so the landlord was the  only one who
would possibly....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Shouji Ichitaka-san,” a woman’s voice, soft,
melodious, and icy, called and cut off his train of thoughts, “I know you are
in there. Please open up.” Chills slithered down his spine. How the heck did
the she know?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Who the hell are you?” he shouted and heard the fear
in his voice. Once, he was a man who knew of no such thing. Once, he was a man
confident that he was but invincible. Now, he didn’t think so anymore. “What do
you want?” The fear grew stronger.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“My name is Minamoto Iriya,” came the reply. “I am the
Director of the Public Relations Department of CyberConnect Corporation. I am
here today to offer a contract with my company to a talented man like you. Do
you not <i>want</i> it, Shouji-san?” Somehow, he was under the impression that
the woman outside his door was smiling.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Ichitaka’s breath caught. Everybody knew that
CyberConnect was the most powerful of the corporations in the world. If
Minamoto Iriya was telling the truth... then he had a chance to rise from the
mud and regain what he lost and more! He was about to leap up from where he sat
and open the door when suddenly suspicion struck him. What could CC Corp
possibly want with a man whose reputation had been stained forever, whose life
had been reduced to this helpless state? If they truly wanted talented people,
they could have recruited a truckload of Toudai graduates any time they wanted.
The fact that they came here for Ichitaka meant that something fishy was going
on. Furthermore, he couldn’t exclude the possibility that the woman wasn’t what
she claimed to be. He was desperate, but he wasn’t a fool.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As if Minamoto could tell what he was thinking, she
said in an amused tone, “If you keep being so cautious, Shouji-san, how could I
show you the contract? A look would not hurt now would it? Or are you afraid
that a frail woman like me would hurt you?” The mocking note in the woman’s
voice was so loud, so obvious that it made Ichitaka’s blood boil.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Deciding that he had nothing to lose, he rose to his
feet and opened the door, at which point he realized that his visitor was a
handsome woman in formal black suit, who was young enough to be his daughter,
whose hand was holding a bag that seemed almost too heavy for such a small
woman to pickup. His face hardened. How could someone with so few years on her
have been able to climb to such a high position in CyberConnect unless she was
lying about it? </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Pleased to meet you, Shouji-san,” Minamoto said with
an incline of her head.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Come in,” Ichitaka commanded roughly. The Gods knew
he should have slammed the door on the woman’s face the way he did the nosy
reporter a couple of months back... but some part of him desperately wanted to
believe the woman’s claim, so he only clutched the door handle and waited until
she had stepped inside before he closed it.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Charming place,” she commented casually and sat down
on the ground in a prim seiza fashion. His mouth thinned in anger. Was she
mocking him again?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Still, he got to admit that the woman was regal. Even
with the empty bottles and burnt cigarette butts around her, she still made
this dump seem a palace. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Show me the papers,” Ichitaka growled after he had
settled down opposite her.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Here you go, sir.” She smiled a very icy smile as she
opened the bag, took out several sheets of papers, and laid them neatly upon
the tatami mat.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Ichitaka picked them up and studied them carefully, as
expected from a professional businessman. He, more than anyone else, was well
aware that unless he paid every scrap of his attention and pondered the meaning
behind every single line of the contract, he risked being taken advantage of
for the rest of his life.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After a few minutes of reading, he gasped aloud.
According to the contract, he was to assume the position of Marketing Director
of the Tokyo Division of CyberConnect Corporation. Along with the position also
came the annual salary of fifty million yen, four weeks of vacation a year, and
other benefits that his old company couldn’t afford paying for. All in all, it
was a contract made of pure gold, one that any person who sought employment
would kill to have.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“This is... too good to be true,” Ichitaka mumbled.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“As I said,” Minamoto Iriya said with a satisfied
smile, “you are a talented man. We are always in dire need of people like you.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“People like me,” he repeated. “You must be kidding.
I’m not going to beat around the bush, Minamoto-san. Tell me now, why did you
want me for such a high position when you’re well aware that I have been pushed
down to the lowest level of society. You, a Public Relations Director of all,
must have done your research beforehand, right?” He focused his eyes on the
handsome face of the woman in black suit. “You know what they said about me.
Shouldn’t you care?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh we sure do,” she agreed. “However, the value that
our company needs is talent. For that, we are willing to turn a blind eye to
whatever had happened to our employees as long as they prove... useful to us.”
She gave him a meaningful glance. “Besides, it is not as if we give you this
position freely, Ichitaka-san. There is a price you have to pay before you can
start working for us.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I noticed,” Ichitaka said dryly. “The contract
specified that unless I fulfilled a certain condition, the position won’t be
mine.” He put down the papers. “What is it that you want me to do?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We want you to deliver your daughter, Shouji An, into
our hands, by whatever means you can think of.” Minamoto smiled viciously. “The
day you succeed is also the way we at CyberConnect would welcome you with open
arms. Of course, we will also take measures to clear your name. We will give
you a life a thousand times better than what you once had.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Ichitaka narrowed his eyes. “An? What business do you
have with that girl?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It was then that Minamoto Iriya started to tell him
the true story behind his damned daughter’s hospitalization. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“And that is why we need your daughter, Shouji-san,”
Minamoto Iriya concluded after half an hour of telling the story to the scum of
society sitting opposite her. Despite the fact that she had been praising his
talent and trivializing his fall from grace since the beginning of the
conversation, she did believe that people like him should be executed on the
spot. She never liked Shouji An to begin with... but it did not change the fact
that she felt for the girl and resented what was done to her during the first
seventeen years of her life.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You are hiding something,” the lowlife observed. “Out
with it.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What do you mean?” she asked innocently.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You conveniently left out the fact that with less
than a fraction of what you offered me, you could hire any thug in this city to
do your biddings,” Shouji Ichitaka said coldly. “Why <i>me</i>?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Because they are not the girl’s father, <i>you</i>
are. <i>You</i> know her best,” Iriya answered matter-of-factly. “Using you
would ensure that we have the highest chance in capturing her. And of course,
you being a talented businessman was a fact that we couldn’t possibly fail to
notice. I can never stress enough that we are always in need of capable employees.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">That was the truth... just not all of it. The true
reason why the Revolutionists wanted Shouji Ichitaka for the job was that he
was the <i>easiest</i> to put the blame on. Paying thugs to kidnap Shouji An
would cost a whole lot less, that much was granted, but thugs were always
treacherous, and they could be traced back to CyberConnect and mess up
everything that was about to come to fruition. This lowlife of a man before her
now, on the other hand, was much easier to deal with. He was all by himself, he
had no one to rely on, thus he could be quickly eliminated should need arise.
And once he was silenced forever, it would be a piece of cake to make sure that
the police’s investigation would go no further than his death. In the end, he
had the perfect motive. Anyone could see that his hatred toward his daughter
was what drove him toward whatever actions he might take against her in the
future. Even a dummy would be able to deduce that the man’s situation was
hopeless, that he only wanted to exact revenge from Shouji An before he <i>ended
his own life</i>. They would never be able to realize that the Revolutionists
were behind the scene and pulling the strings on the puppet.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That’s all?” Shouji demanded suspiciously.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“That is all,” Iriya agreed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Very well,” the lowlife said. “I accept the
condition. I’ll give An to you as soon as I can lay a hand on her. But I’ll
need her personal information, such as address and cell phone number.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You will have them.” Iriya nodded. Oh how quick he was
in deciding, how nonchalant he was in saying that he would hand his blood
daughter to them so that the girl could be experimented on, how heartless this
man was. Still, she said nothing. Once she had given Shouji what he asked for,
she left the building, marveling to herself how amazingly easy it was to
deceive a man in a hopeless situation. For all the suspicion that Shouji
Ichitaka had tossed at her, she was certain the man never once seriously tried
to find out whether Iriya’s claim, or even the contract, was valid. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It, obviously, was not.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The contract was merely a piece of paper that had
absolutely no legal effect. True, it was written by one of the top members of
the Revolutionist, in the careful and precise wording of any contract offered
to any new employee, but that did not mean that it was worth more than any
other piece of trash that Shouji Ichitaka could pick up on the street. Were the
man to bring it to any branch of CyberConnect, they would tell him immediately
that he was holding in his hand a piece of forgery, however intricately
wrought. But surely, the man was not going to do that, or anything that might
destroy his faith. He was desperate. He needed something to believe in. He
wanted to be assured that he was going to be alright. No matter whether he was
aware of it or not, the lowlife had wagered his life on the possibility that
Iriya was telling the truth.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Wrong choice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Not only would Iriya disabuse the lowlife of his
wishful dream once he had accomplished the task, she was also going to kill
him. The secret must be protected. They could not very well have him going
berserk after learning that he had been deceived and thoroughly taken advantage
of, now could they? And besides, it was not as though anybody would grieve for
the man’s death, least of all his blood daughter. After all, Shouji Ichitaka
was the lowest of the low, a man who could not compare to an insect. When
someone like him vanished, this world became a little bit better. Not much, of
course, but it would still please Iriya greatly to make that happen with her
own hands.</span></p>

ice cream,” An said before she dove into the sea of people milling about the
attraction spots of the Tokyo Dome City.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Sitting on her wheelchair near a gushing fountainhead,
eyes glued at her lovely girlfriend’s retreating back, Misono Mariko couldn’t
help but wonder in amazement what could have taken over the girl who had cried
uncontrollably in Mariko’s arms a week ago. An had seemed so depressed and so
heartbroken then, so when she showed up at Mariko’s door on this glorious
Saturday morning and invited Mariko to go out on a <i>date</i> while looking as
vibrant as a little bird in spring, Mariko could only gape in surprise. Not in
the least did she expect that the high school freshman would answer with such a
brilliant smile on her wonderful face that they were going to go to Tokyo Dome
City when asked.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Never once after the accident that cost Mariko the
ability to walk did she ever imagine that she would be here one day. Why should
she, when she knew full well that she was going to be denied the service of
most attractions in the amusement park due to her disability? Why should she,
when she was aware that her mother, Misono Madoka, feared that Mariko would end
up wallowing in self-pity were she to see people do things that she could never
do? Somehow, Madoka never found it in herself to believe that her daughter
didn’t care much about such things anymore. True, she would inevitably feel a
trifle sad having to sit here, on the ground, on her wheelchair, while other
visitors had such fun on the Linear Gale rollercoaster or the Tower Hacker, a
structure that offered the experience of a two-hundred-and-sixty-feet<WBR>-freefall,
but she was definitely not going to let those negative feelings weigh her down
for the rest of her life. An was the sole person who understood that.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As she raised her head to look around for any sight of
her sweetheart, Mariko’s eyes found her. With the winds caressing her short
brown hair, with a healthy color on her full, smooth cheeks, with an ice cream
cone in each hand, she looked every inch an angel on earth. Even amidst a sea
of people, even when her outfit was but plain – An claimed she was so used to
her shirts and short pants that wearing anything else would make her decidedly
uncomfortable – while those around her apparently had pulled out their best
clothes from the wardrobe, she still shone as brightly as the sun on high.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">As Mariko gazed at her girlfriend’s approaching
figure, she couldn’t help but smile. Yes, unlike Madoka, An understood that
Mariko had better use of her time than brooding over a fate she couldn’t
possibly alter. Others might have a hard time believing it... but instead of
envying the people around her, she was actually happy for them. Of course, she
wasn’t as fortunate as they were in that she couldn’t walk on her own legs
under the vast heavens... but in that she had a girlfriend whom she loved, who
loved her more than anyone else in the world.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Here you go, Mariko,” An said with a smile as she
gave Mariko the ice cream cone. It had green tea’s flavor, her favorite.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Thanks, An.” She returned the smile and watched in
blessed silence as her girlfriend sat down on the bench next to the wheelchair
and nibbled on her own cone. Yes, all signs of depression and sadness had
vanished off the seventeen-year-old, leaving behind the cheerful and childlike
Shouji An with whom Mariko had fallen in love. She only wondered what had
happened....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s only ten o’clock, so we have another hour to go.
Mariko, do you want to go somewhere before they let us into the LaQua
building....” The high school freshman trailed off as she turned to Mariko and
noticed that Mariko’s eyes had been on her all along. The girl’s complexion
went slightly pink. “Why aren’t you eating yours? It’s melting,” she pointed
out, her face a mix of embarrassment and delight, her deep blue eyes two
brilliant gems that reflected all the glory of the cloudless heavens. Mariko
knew that her love for An didn’t make her exactly impartial... but she still
believed that no other girl in this world could be as cute as her sweetheart.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m going to.” Mariko chuckled and began to sample
her green tea-flavored cone. It tasted very good.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“As I was saying,” An said, “we have another hour to
go before the LaQua building opened. Is there somewhere you want to go before
that?” She spread the Tokyo Dome City map across her lap and glanced a question
at Mariko.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In TDC, there was a high-class spa and restaurant
resort called the LaQua Center, where visitors could immerse themselves in the
natural Koishikawa Hot Springs, rumored to be highly effective for skin care
and curing shoulder discomfort and some other kind of physical ailments. On the
fifth floor of the building was the restaurant, where only the best cuisines
were served along with a breath-taking view of the Tokyo Dome at night, when
the stars on high and the lights of the entire amusement park fused into a
spectacular scenery. LaQua, in other words, possessed the features that made
Tokyo Dome City one of the most popular attraction centers in Tokyo.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The famous spa resort, in fact, was the reason why An
took her here today. An’s father, Sakuma Ryo-san, had gifted them with two VIP
one-day passes for the Tokyo Dome City, which granted free service in all the
attraction spots within TDC, including every floor of the LaQua center itself.
The novelist claimed that one of his connections – the man accidentally let
slip that it was a lady – received the VIP passes as bonus for her job, but she
didn’t want to go so she gave them to him in the end. Mariko somehow... doubted
that. Since he was an utterly indulgent and doting father, it was highly likely
that he had purchased the passes himself and lied that they came from another
person as a gift. She hoped she was wrong. The passes were extremely
expensive... and Ryo-san’s financial situation wasn’t looking so well lately...
so she would feel really bad if that were the case.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mariko?” An’s concerned voice jerked her back to
reality.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah, I’m sorry,” she murmured ruefully, “I was
thinking about something.” She took her girlfriend’s vacant hand into hers and
gave it an affectionate squeeze. “Say, would you like to ride that Ferris wheel
over there?” Mariko suggested. “I’d like to have a look at the whole Tokyo Dome
City from above.” That was one of the reasons, yes. Almost instinctively, her
eyes darted toward the great oak tree about thirty feet or so to her right. She
gave a quiet sigh, almost unheard. She knew it was necessary, that it was the
right thing to do, but it didn’t necessarily mean that she liked it.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko suppressed a second sigh.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Shall we go?” An’s voice spoke softly while she was
no where to be seen. Turning her head, she saw that the high school freshman
had positioned herself behind the wheelchair with her hands on the handles, a
bright smile gracing her lips.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes,” she answered, and An wheeled her toward the end
of the long, serpentine line of people waiting for their turn on the Ferris
wheel.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Don’t you think this place is really pretty, Mariko?”
Shouji An murmured softly as she peered out of one of the glass panels on the
gondola. From here, a hundred feet above the ground, everything looked so
small. The visitors, mostly adults who were half as tall and nearly twice as
wide as her, now appeared tiny ants roaming around in chaos. Down there, they
were rude, loud, noisy, and apparently blind the way they kept stepping on each
other’s feet and bumping into one another’s front. Up here, they seemed to be
on another planet.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Truth be told, An disliked amusement parks the way she
did any other sort of crowded places. Had it not been for Mariko, the one she
loved, she would never have come here even if she was threatened by a dozen
grownups armed from their teeth to their toes. She couldn’t help but smile. Oh
how much she had changed. Several months ago, up to the time she first found
herself trapped in The World, she had been a brat whose heart was not large
enough to house anybody except herself and whose world comprised only of the
room in which she lived. Now, her heart beat for Mariko alone, and her world
was where the young woman was.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mariko?” she asked and turned around after a few
minutes of no reply from her beloved. She froze. Although the twenty-year-old,
clad in an unbuttoned white blouse, a blue collar shirt, and a pair of black
jeans, was the one who suggested that they ride on the Ferris wheel in the
first place, she currently paid no attention to the scenery. Sitting opposite
from An, the blue-haired beauty merely gazed ahead, her shiny amber eyes fixed
on nothing other than An’s face. She blushed. When she was still Tsukasa in The
World, she never had problems looking at Mariko or even holding the woman in
her arms... but in the real world, every look Mariko sent her way never failed
to quicken her heartbeat. And when Mariko kissed her....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She had never figured out why it made such a big
difference in real life.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I thought you wanted to go up here to look at the
scenery,” she accused. She only wished her voice had been strong and stern
enough to match her words.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes, but only partly.” Mariko laughed softly into her
hand. “Will you come over here, please?” She patted the vacant spot on her
bench.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sure.” An swallowed audibly, which made her
girlfriend’s laughter grow a little bit louder and more amused, then moved to
Mariko’s side. As soon as she settled down, she found Mariko’s head resting on
her shoulder, and the former’s soft and fragrant body leaning against the left
side of her own. Despite the fact that it should be the thousandth time or so
that Mariko showed her affection through physical contact, she still couldn’t
prevent her heart to leap up her throat and race fast enough to beat a horse
when it came down. Only very dimly did she feel herself wrapping her arm around
her girlfriend’s back, put a hand on the hollow of her waist, and snuggled much
closer. The contented sigh issued from Mariko’s mouth told An she appreciated
it.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Do you want to know the real reason behind my wanting
to ride the Ferris wheel?” she heard Mariko speak very softly with the voice
she used only in private. Musical, sweet, and very soothing.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s because up here, I don’t have to be afraid that
Satou-san would see me being intimate with you and report to Ryo-san,” Mariko’s
voice dropped to a quiet whisper that only made the flames on An’s cheeks burn
even more fiercely. Worse, the warmth radiating from the body the lovely young
woman threatened to overload her senses. “Just several minutes alone with you...
but it’s going to be enough.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Satou-san was the name of the man whom the famous
hacker Helba charged with the duty of protecting An’s beloved. When her dad
reported to Helba, Balmung, and Lios what had happened between her and the
stern woman who claimed to be the Public Relations Director of CC Corp, they
had decided that something needed to be done. Amongst the four, the mysterious
Helba alone possessed the power to dispatch men – assistants she called them –
as she wished, so she took on the responsibility of guarding An and Mariko. As
a result, they now had a professional bodyguard for a tail, who would make sure
that no one suspicious would come within ten feet of either. Sure, that felt
really assuring when she thought in horror that Minamoto Iriya was lurking
somewhere nearby, scheming to make her sign that contract... but at the same
time the protection had caused them all sort of inconveniences.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An and Mariko were no longer able to show their
affection for each other outside of their rooms without risking Ryo discovering
their relationship.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Not that Mariko cared too much about the whole secrecy
business, she simply respected An’s wish that neither of the parents should
learn what was going on until An felt comfortable enough to tell them. Well...
maybe she could do that with Ryo first... or she thought she could. Ryo was an
open-minded man, and she was truly glad to have him for a father... but this
was rather sensitive... and she couldn’t be certain that he wasn’t one of the
people who had a heart attack as soon as they heard about two girls being more
than just friends. After all, they had just been an official family for several
months. There were still a lot that An didn’t know about the novelist. Mariko
believed that Ryo probably wouldn’t see it as an issue... but An couldn’t be so
sure.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">And then... there was still Misono Madoka to deal
with. An loved her girlfriend with all her heart... but she had to admit that
the young woman’s mom had but a fraction of Ryo’s affability. No matter how
hard An tried to approach her, the middle-aged office lady never seemed moved
by her efforts. Madoka, despite being the mother of the cheerful and ever so
lovely Misono Mariko, had never greeted An with a friendly face. There could be
no mistake. All that the woman ever harbored toward An was hostility. The
explosive kind. She could see it in those tired amber eyes, she could hear it
in Madoka’s curt words, and she could feel it very clearly every time she went
near her. It was one of the mysteries in her life to which she never found an
answer. How in the Gods’ names did she manage to make an enemy out of the
mother of the woman she loved without trying?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An shivered. If she was unsure how Ryo would react to
the news that she were dating Mariko, she was but certain that the young
woman’s mom would fetch a knife as soon as being told. Not the wisest thing for
An to do... evidently.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“An,” Mariko’s voice and the feel of her smooth palm
against An cheek brought her back to the interior of the slowly rising gondola.
Her lovely girlfriend was gazing at her, slightly worried. “Is there anything
wrong?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m thinking about your mom,” An confessed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You shouldn’t,” her girlfriend said softly and
soothingly as she once again laid her head upon An’s shoulder. Her arms tightened
around An’s own “Everything will be alright. My mom always wants the best for
me... and when she realizes that I need you more than anything, she’ll accept
you.” She didn’t sound half as convincing as she should... and An doubted that
Misono Madoka would give up her daughter to a <i>girl</i>, one she especially
disliked at that, without putting up a bloody fight.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay,” An told the older woman, trying to sound
cheerful.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Smiling, Mariko lifted her head, pressed her hand
gently against the back of An’s neck, and kissed her. When her girlfriend
pulled away, An thought her face was on fire once more. “Don’t you wish that
this ride won’t be over for another hour or so?” the blue-haired beauty in her
arms whispered before she leaned in again. Their lips stayed pressed together
much longer this time... and they didn’t part until the gondola approached the
ground. When An left the circular compartment with Mariko in her arms, she
noticed that the operator was studying her with an odd expression on his face.
He had the look of someone who had seen something he shouldn’t have.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Face aflame, An tried to ignore the man, wheeled
Mariko away, and never stopped until she realized that she had reached the
LaQua center without meaning to.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We still have the rest of the day, An,” Mariko
commented with a smile. “No need to come straight here.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Deciding not to tell her girlfriend about the Ferris
wheel operator but not really having a good excuse, An fumbled hurriedly in her
mind, trying to find one. She finally did.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“The spa will be open in just a couple of minutes,”
she explained. “If we come early, we may not have to share the Hot Springs with
other people.” Mariko knew perfectly well that An wasn’t very comfortable
around strangers, especially in this place, where she had to enter a spring
naked, so the young woman would most likely believe what An just said.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well... it’s good you think that far ahead...” the
blue-haired twenty-year-old hesitated and looked up at An with her beautiful
amber eyes, “but do you really want to be in the onsen alone... with me?” She
lowered her gaze and started fidgeting with her blouse’s buttons.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Shock seized An. For all the planning she did last
night, she never questioned herself what going to the spa with Mariko would
mean. And worse, since there was nobody around the Center at this moment while
it was about to open any time soon, chances were that the excuse An came up
with would come true. Her blood started to boil. For all the kissing and
embracing they had done in private, they never attempted to go any further...
and now... they were going to see each other in nothing but their skin. She
wasn’t really sure if it was what she really wanted to happen.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Silence passed between them, with neither dared to
look the other in the eye, until An decided that backing out at this point
would be really stupid and wasteful.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’ll be alright,” she managed weakly, “I think.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay then,” replied Mariko in a voice that was no
stronger.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">At that moment, the “Open” sign behind the double
glass door flashed into life and signified that the Center was now functional.
A minute barely passed before a female assistant, in blue and white uniform of
LaQua, appeared and bid them welcome with a deep bow. Stuffing hesitation into
the deepest corner of her mind and locking it there, An wheeled Mariko inside
the Center, hoping that she wasn’t going to die from the embarrassment.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Fifteen minutes later, she panicked.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mostly immersed in the hot water under the wooden
rafters that allowed a limited view of the cerulean sky, surrounded by the
rocks that lined the somewhat rectangular outdoor bath, accompanied by her
girlfriend, An decided that it was a bad idea to come here in the first place.
Well, sure, it was really soothing and relaxing in the onsen... but the comfort
of the body couldn’t compensate for the unease of her mind. In fact, she
thought half of her existence was screaming at her and urging her to get out of
here immediately. As for the other half... it was whispering in a very alluring
voice and suggesting that she moved closer to the wonder sitting but half a
hand to her left.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An glanced sideways.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There she was, the love of An’s life, gazing straight
ahead so intensely that it was obvious she was trying not to look in An’s
direction. Thanks to the hot spring’s water, which bore the green color of the
the pool’s floor, most of Mariko’s naked figure was safely concealed. All An
could see of her lovely girlfriend was the blue flowing hair glistened from the
moisture of the steam, her pearly neck, her slender shoulders, and a part of
her firm, ample chest, the sight of which whipped An’s head back to where it
was. Her breathing quickened considerably, as did her heart pulse. Whatever
people might believe... being a girl did <i>not</i> help in this kind of
situation... at all.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The voices in her head were still struggling against
one another in a fierce battle. On one hand, she wanted to pull the young woman
into her arms, embraced her as tightly as she could, and relished the feel of
her sweetheart’s bare body, a feel that she never experienced. On the other
hand, she was so ashamed at the thought that she wished she could bang her head
against one of the rocks. Hugging her knees, she dipped her head under the
water surface, hoping the hot spring would somehow help her cleanse her head
and snuff out the fire beneath her skin.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It didn’t. Gods, but she wished her dad hadn’t offered
her the VIP passes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The sound of splashing water caught her attention and
turned her head. Mariko, her hands on the floor, was trying to shift her body
into a more upright position. She slipped and lost her balance. Before An could
think, her arms had already reached out to catch the one she loved. That was
how she ended up with the young woman in her embrace afterwards. Her breath
caught, her blood rushed to her face, and her mind went numb as she looked down
and found Mariko’s amber eyes gazing upward, the tips of their noses so close
together they almost touched. Her breaths on An’s face were searing –
pleasantly so, oddly enough – even amidst the steam rising from the water, her
flesh hot enough to make her breaths seem cool.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Eyes riveted on her girlfriend’s beautiful face,
decorated with droplets of water that shone like gemstones under the sunlight,
An felt herself trembling. This was certainly not good.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Yet... even though she knew that anyone could step
into the outdoor bath at this moment, she couldn’t seem able to peel herself
away from Mariko’s slender frame. Worse, as if she had lost the control over
herself, she could only watch as her arms tightened around the body of her
girlfriend, as her hand started to wander the young woman’s back... lower...
and lower still.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">When Mariko’s upper body suddenly tensed up, the fear
that she was going to be mad at An stayed her hands completely. That was why
she was taken aback when her sweet girlfriend nuzzled her nose against hers,
moved in, and claimed her lips. As she sensed Mariko’s arm fasten around her
waist and remove the distance between their bare bodies, however little it was,
she closed her eyes and let her passion shatter the fragile rein she had placed
on herself from the beginning. Without any reservation and embarrassment to
hold her back, An poured her heart and soul into a kiss that was much more
intense than any they ever shared. Her tongue, as though possessing a will of
its own, entered her sweetheart’s mouth, seeking warmth, sweetness, and
reciprocation.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The intimacy probably was too much for her beloved
girlfriend to bear.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The young woman suddenly withdrew her lips, put her
hands on An’s shoulders, and pushed herself away. Instinctively and almost
unconsciously, An tried to pull her sweetheart back into her arms and kissed
her again for all she was worth. She couldn’t, for Mariko had pressed a hand
against An’s lips and halted her dead in her tracks. Panic was all that filled
the young woman’s deep amber eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry,” Mariko whispered, her breath ragged, her
voice sheepish. “I have to stop. If I don’t...” she paused and swallowed hard,
“I can’t imagine what’s going to happen.” She gave an apologetic smile. “I
don’t want the management to charge you with public indecency.” Afterwards, she
gazed at An and let her fingertips trail down An’s cheek in a most loving and
longing manner. That facial expression, regretful and unbelievably cute at the
same time, did not help, at all.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Accepting the VIP passes, An thought bitterly, was the
greatest mistake in her life. It made her realize that deep down, she craved
for Mariko’s body as much as she did the young woman’s soul, a desire she never
thought she possessed. The knowledge was very... disquieting... especially when
she knew that she was going to stay over at Mariko’s tonight.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The <i>entire</i> night, with no one else there to
interfere should the two of them decide to continue where they left off.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p align="center" style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:center;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">***</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“We’re home,” Misono Mariko murmured when the
wheelchair pulled to a stop in front of her apartment on the sixth floor of the
Kanagawa Place. “Here you go.” She handed her girlfriend the key, which An took
and used to unlock the door. Gazing at An’s back, Mariko’s mind reeled. Earlier
today, when the sun was dawning upon the skyscrapers of Tokyo, Madoka had left
for the Tokyo Station so that she could catch a train to Saitama with her
supervisor. She wasn’t going to return until tomorrow evening, if then. An knew
this... so she had offered to stay with Mariko until her mom came back. She had
only been grateful toward the high school freshman in the beginning, knowing
that the love of her life was very worried about her.... Yet... after the
episode at the LaQua Center... Mariko was having second thoughts.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Would she dare let An stay overnight when just several
hours ago, she nearly jumped out of her skin trying to kiss the girl forever?
In fact, had she not invoked every ounce of her willpower to stop herself from
going any further, she would have. The very thought was frightening. Never
before did she realize how strong her yearning toward An was. Never before did
she fully understand that the closer she was to her girlfriend, the more likely
it would be for her to want to consummate their relationship. It was human
nature. It couldn’t be helped.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The door creaked open, revealing an interior lit by
the light that came pouring in through the glass windows. While An was wheeling
her inside, Mariko surreptitiously studied the girl she loved over her
shoulder. Based on the way uneasiness grew on her face after every step she
took, Mariko would say that the high school freshman was deeply disturbed. Not that
it was rare to see An so whenever she visited Mariko, of course. Madoka, might
the Gods bless her, had always treated An with such coldness and hostility that
even Mariko became extremely unsettled as soon as her girlfriend and her mom
came within five feet of one another. Still, at this moment, Mariko was under
the impression that An’s uneasy mood had been greatly augmented. She but
wondered if the girl was still thinking about what had happened in the hot
springs.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko let out a quiet sigh and hoped that the rest of
the day wouldn’t be as... exciting as the time they spent in Tokyo Dome City.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Fifteen minutes had barely passed when her heart
assured her that what she wished for wasn’t going to come true.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It all started when they sat down to watch a DVD An
rented on the way home. An told her that the sempais in her acting club hailed
this movie as the ultimate romance flick ever brought to the screen. Mariko
never found out whether the claim was justified or not... because during the
first hour that followed, in which An gazed at the TV intensely, she couldn’t
keep her attention on anything else except the lovely girl who was sitting on
the same couch, a good arm’s length away. At first, Mariko didn’t understand
why she was so restless... and it disturbed her greatly when the reason finally
dawned upon her.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She was longing desperately for physical contact with
the high school freshman. She fervently wanted to be touched.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Granted, the need was always there; she was head over
heels in love, after all. Still, it was but a tiny spark of emotion that was
perfectly controlled under other circumstances. Now, it was a bonfire that
couldn’t be doused. The intimacy moment they shared in the onsen had taken its
toll. She wasn’t sure its damage was going to be repaired... if ever.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Toward the second half of the movie, it dawned on
Mariko that unless she did something, she was going to be driven insane.
Sighing, she reached for An’s hand. At the contact, the brown-haired girl gave
a start that nearly lifted her from the couch. Despite the flame that was
burning her inside out and putting her on edge, Mariko laughed at her
girlfriend’s reaction. Sheepish and shy as the girl was, she had never been so
jumpy before.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes?” the seventeen-year-old asked afterward, her
face reddening, her voice anxious and tight.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Can I rest my head on your lap?” Mariko asked, voice
slightly sheepish. “I’d like to lie down for a little bit.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sure.” The answer was hesitant, but it did come.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The high school freshman rose to her feet and helped
Mariko lie down on her side on the couch. Then as requested, she settled down
near one end and laid Mariko’s head on her lap in a most gentle manner. Sighing
again, this time in contentment, Mariko rubbed her cheek against An’s thighs,
covered by her short pants, and unintentionally elicited a small gasp from her
lovely girlfriend. Smiling inwardly, she closed her eyes and enjoyed the sense
of serenity that slowly enveloped her entire self. Shortly afterwards, she felt
An’s hand on her head, stroking it slowly, tentatively, and awkwardly. Cooing
softly with her eyes still closed, she took that warm, tender hand into hers
and brought it to her mouth, where she placed light kisses on its palm and
fingertips. Then she pressed it against her cheek and kept it there. Her
girlfriend showed no sign that she wanted to take it back.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You don’t like this movie,” the seventeen-year-old
observed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Do you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No, it was really boring.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“But you seemed to enjoy it the way you glued your
eyes on the screen.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Silence.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko was surprised when she realized that the hand
on her cheek was growing hotter and a little bit sweatier. She opened her eyes,
turned around, and looked up. Her sweetheart was blushing. She suddenly
understood. An did have her eyes fixed on the screen, but she didn’t do so
because the movie was interesting. <i>‘She was just avoiding looking at me,’</i>
Mariko thought. The incident at the LaQua Center had unnerved her so badly that
she forgot that it could have affected the other girl, too. In fact, since An was
the more bashful between the two of them, she must have been shocked to the
base of her foundation.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry, An,” she murmured as her hand rose and
placed its palm against her sweetheart’s cheek. “I must have upset you. I...
lost self-control back there in the hot spring so I.... I’m sorry. I really
am,” she repeated her apology in great apprehension, hoping with all her heart
that An wasn’t angry with her. She wished she hadn’t kissed An in the LaQua
Center’s outdoor bath. She wished she had been able to exert a little more
control on herself and not let her impulse take over.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well... to tell you the truth,” An said after a
moment of silence, during which she did nothing except gazing deeply into
Mariko’s eyes, “I didn’t fare any better.” The color on the freshman’s face
deepened. “You looked so beautiful back there that I couldn’t help myself. If
you hadn’t stopped first, there was no telling what I would have done.” Toward
the end, her voice dropped so low that had Mariko not strained her ears to listen,
she would never have heard. Once she realized what An said, though, she felt
herself blushing furiously.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Silence descended once more... only that this time, it
made Mariko extremely uncomfortable. Despite the fact that she was trying her
best to refrain from recalling the torrential current of love and desire she
experienced in the onsen, An’s honest words laid all her efforts and
determination to waste. The memory rose in her mind stronger than ever. It was
as if she was still immersed in the hot water of the outdoor bath. It was as if
she were still being held within the curve of An’s arms. Even now, she could
still recall the texture of An’s moist and silky skin, the firmness of her
breasts, the fragrant scent of the shampoo she washed her hair with before
entering the onsen, and the incredible sweetness of her lips and tongue.
Mariko’s body started growing hot, her throat dry, her breath uneven, and her
mind numb. She could feel liquid desire coursing in her veins. She could hear
it sing endlessly in her ears. She knew what it was urging her to do.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">‘This is bad,’</span></i><span style="font-size:12.0pt">

she thought in alarm.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Knowing that An felt the same way as her surely didn’t
help. In fact, it just made the situation decidedly more awkward and disquieting,
for while her head was buzzing with thoughts more indecent than any that she
ever had in her life, the target of those thoughts was within her arm’s reach.
Worse, as she looked up, she realized that her own longing was mirrored in the
deep blue eyes of the girl she cherished. That was when she fully registered
the fact that resistance was futile.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">It wasn’t very clear whether Mariko lifted her head or
An lowered hers first. All that Mariko knew was that their mouths met
afterwards in a kiss that was soft, light, and tentative in the beginning but
grew so intense so quickly that it could easily put the one they had in the
Koishikawa Hot Springs to shame. And so they lips remained locked together,
parting only ever so quickly to replenish the air in their lungs just so they
could kiss again. Dignity cast aside, inhibitions forgotten, embarrassment
damned to the deepest layer of hell, the only thing Mariko desired at this
moment was everything that her lover could offer... everything she possessed....</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">With her entire consciousness submerged in the ocean
of bliss, only very dimly did she feel An’s hand fall softly upon her cheek,
where it stopped momentarily to caress her in a most loving manner before it
descended down her face, her neck, and then her breast. Surprised, Mariko’s
eyes sprang open as she broke the kiss. As if struck, the brown-haired girl
recoiled, regret and embarrassment but evident across her face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry,” she muttered, her head hanging in shame,
“I... I presumed too much.... I really shouldn’t have.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No, no, it’s not that,” Mariko frantically assured
the high school freshman. “I was just surprised, that’s all. I love being
touched by you, An,” she added once she noticed that her girlfriend didn’t give
any indication that she believed. “Besides... don’t you think we should retire
to my room? I’d much prefer... my bed to this couch.” Mariko couldn’t even
force herself to imagine how her mom would react if she heard her say such an
embarrassing thing... to another girl. Madoka wouldn’t disown her... would she?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Are you sure, Mariko?” An asked worriedly after a
while. “I don’t want you to regret later just because of my selfish wish.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The response brought a little smile to Mariko’s lips.
Cupping An’s chin with one hand, she quietly pulled the brown-haired girl’s
face a little bit lower just so Mariko could place a soft peck on the tip of
her nose. “I’m not going to regret it, An,” she whispered, “because... that’s
what I want from the bottom of my heart, too.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“For real?” An asked wonderingly. She sounded unable
to believe her own ears.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes,” Mariko answered. “A thousand times yes.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">An said nothing and gazed at her for a good five
minutes before she gently scooped Mariko into her arms and carried her toward
her room. Joy and love were all that could be seen on the freshman’s wonderful
face. <i>‘I love you so much, An,’</i> was the only thought Mariko had before
she was laid gently upon the soft mattress of her bed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>

supervisor, a woman who already gray in the hair and long in the tooth, Misono
Madoka quietly dial her daughter’s cell phone number. Because of her job, she
had had to leave the child home all alone today, something she had not done
during the last ten years of her life... and within every second that she spent
on this trip, she grew more worried and restless. It was high time she called
and made sure everything was alright with Mariko. She wished she hadn’t been so
busy ever since she stepped onto the train that departed from Tokyo. She only
hoped nothing had happened at home.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Deep down... she had a terrible feeling that something
already <i>did</i>.</span></p>

the small table nearby, Misono Mariko was under the impression that her life,
ripped to shreds by that terrible accidents ten years in the shadow of the past
and newly mended several months ago by the appearance of the one girl who was
trapped in The World, had just been made anew. She turned her head and found
herself unable to breathe.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Reclining against the headboard of the bed was her
beloved girlfriend, Shouji An, whose tender arms wrapped protectively around
Mariko’s waist, whose hands laced atop her abdomen, whose front rose and fell
most seductively against her back, whose chin rested on her shoulder, whose
heart beat in a quiet but alluring melody along with her very own. Under a
blanket that guarded their bodies against the cold weather and augmented the
warmth that stemmed from every fiber of their existence, Mariko felt as though
she had been melted into one single entity as the one she loved. At this
moment, joy and contentment were all that filled her soul... and if someone
told her that her legs were going to stay disabled for the rest of her life,
her spirit still wouldn’t be dampened one bit. Nothing mattered except An...
and as long as she remained by Mariko’s side, this world would always remain
her paradise. <i>‘Where I truly belong,’</i> she thought.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mariko?” An called, her voice a soft whisper that
spoke volumes of love, her warm breath a caress on Mariko’s face. She gazed at
her lover in utmost wonder. It was as if the magical encounter they had but a
moment ago had removed the last shreds of reservation from An. It was as if the
girl’s innate shyness had never existed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Misono Mariko had never been drunk except that one
time a few years back, when she was so depressed she decided to use alcohol to
make herself forget the torment of living. She knew that Madoka always had a in
the fridge a bottle of red wine, from which she once in a while would drink one
or two cups at night to overcome her chronic insomnia and ease her way into the
world of dreams. That day, when her mom was still at work, she had taken out
the bottle and consumed half of its content. She never woke until a full day
had passed, and once she did she immediately suffered from a massive hangover
and a serious scolding from Madoka at the same time, but she never forgot how
the wine had elevated her from depression and erased all her sorrows. Just now,
that one word from her lover, a simple call of her name, reminded her exactly
how it felt to have half a bottle of wine infused in her blood.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The sensation of the brown-haired girl’s naked body pressed
against hers only served to increase the intoxicating effect.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yes?” she answered with a voice that was equally
soft.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s time for dinner,” An said after a glance at the
clock on the desk sitting opposite the bed, near the computer. It read seven
thirty in the evening. “Do you want me to prepare something for you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko shook her head. “It’s okay, I’m not hungry.
Stay here, don’t go anywhere.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Her traitorous stomach decided to contradict her words
by rumbling slightly beneath An’s interlaced hands. The girl tightened her arms
around Mariko’s body and laughed softly against her neck. She blushed hotly.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s not good for your health to stay hungry, you
know,” her sweetheart told her. For some reason, Mariko was reminded of her
mom. She could only shake her head in wonder. How in Heaven’s name could two
persons on opposite sides of the spectrum sound so much alike? “What do you
want to eat?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Knowing that she couldn’t get out of this no matter
what she attempted, and that An only wanted the best thing for her, Mariko
tried to think of a dish which didn’t take too long to prepare, and which
wouldn’t require An to go to some nearby grocery store to get the ingredients.
She suddenly realized that her girlfriend didn’t have to cook at all.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“My mom left me a large pot of beef stew that she made
last night,” she said. “It’s in the fridge.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay, I’ll heat it up.” An unlaced her hands and
withdrew her arms from Mariko’s waist. The girl’s vanishing touch elicited a
deep, regretful sigh. “Wait just a bit, ne? I’ll be right back. Or do you want
to eat in the kitchen?” By the time the brown-haired girl was done saying that,
she were already standing on the floor and pulling on her white shirt and
pants, leaving Mariko lying on her side on the bed, her bare frame safely
concealed beneath the thick blanket. The Gods standing witness, Mariko had lain
alone on this very same mattress, in this very same room during the last ten
years... but right now, she decided that she hated it. It took most of her
strength just to refrain herself from pulling her girlfriend back to bed and
never let go.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Here’s okay,” she replied. She really didn’t want to
put An through the trouble of carrying her to the kitchen just to bring her
back here a while later. She was slightly taller, and heavier than what a frail
young girl could carry without tiring herself out in the end. “And just pop it
into the microwave. No need to use the stove,” she called before An could open
the door to her room and leave.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Standing at the doorstep, An turned around and
mumbled, her face stained by blossoming colorful spots, “You just want to have
me back here as soon as possible, don’t you?” She grinned afterwards.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Can you blame me?” Mariko answered softly with a
smile. “Who would want to be apart from you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The color of the spots deepened. “Well, I can think of
a number of people,” her grin faltered a little bit... but it grew wider after
a look at Mariko’s face. “But no, I’m not going to let you follow dad’s bad
eating habit. Even though I keep telling him that microwave is bad for his
health, he never listens.” She shook her head exasperatedly. “Well, he I could
do nothing about... but you...” a mischievous gleam appeared in her deep blue
eyes, “I’ll make sure <i>you</i> eat properly.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">With that, the girl left.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She <i>does</i> sound like mom,” Mariko muttered
ruefully to herself.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After fifteen minutes, which stretched so painfully
long that Mariko would have sworn she had waited for more than an hour, An
reappeared in the room with a tray in hands. On it sat a bowl of beef stew from
which smoke was still billowing. It smelled so good that it made Mariko’s mouth
water, much to her dismay. Madoka seldom had time to prepare anything for her
daughter – they, like Ryo-san when An was in school, lived mainly on canned
food – but when she did cook, she wouldn’t lose to most restaurant chefs in
Tokyo. Mariko’s mom could turn a simple dish into exquisite cuisine, and she
knew it for fact. This beef stew was proof enough.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Here you go.” An placed the tray across Mariko’s lap
after she had helped her sit up straight on the bed with the blanket wrapped
around her person. “Eat while it’s still hot.” From An’s tone, anyone would
have said that between the two of them, she was the older. Mariko could only
let out a quiet chuckle and let it slide. Besides, it felt good to be babied by
the one she loved. She wasn’t going to admit it to the girl’s face any time
soon, though. </span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Is it good?” An asked once Mariko had a chance to eat
a few spoons. The girl was sitting on her knees on the floor, arms folded on
the mattress, chin propped on one hand, lips curved upward in a fond smile that
lovers reserved for each other.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Try it and find out,” Mariko said and fed her
sweetheart a spoonful she already blew on to lessen the heat.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Your mom’s good!” An exclaimed afterwards.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She is,” Mariko agreed. “Want more?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> “It’s okay, I can get my own bowl.” The
seventeen-year-old shook her head. “It’s your portion.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You brought me too much,” Mariko protested, “I can’t
finish it anyway. Help me, ne?” She was telling the whole truth. Judging from
the size of the bowl that she was given, her girlfriend must have thought that
Mariko had been starved for days.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay.” The Touyou Eiwa freshman rose to her feet and
sat down on Mariko’s left, where they shared the rest of the stew. Who would
have thought that the simple act of feeding her lover with her own hand could
make her so happy? Who could have figured that just by sitting by one another’s
side, watching each other eat, could provide a contentment that even wealth and
fame would fail to give?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Do you want more, Mariko?” An inquired. The bowl,
along with the tray, now lay atop the table, its content now generating a
source of warmth deep within Mariko’s stomach.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Gods, no!” She laughed. “What do you take me for, a
glutton?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You ate so little when we had lunch in LaQua,” An
said, her tone reeking of disapproval.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“So did you,” Mariko countered, more amused than ever.
Did the girl honestly expect that one could keep her appetite after the incident
in the outdoor bath? While they were dining in the high-class restaurant on the
fifth floor of LaQua Center, the only thing that Mariko felt was the need to
throw the knife and fork away and find a hole to bury herself under. She
suspected that the other girl must have experienced the same problem the way
she insisted on murdering and mutilating her food before she ate it.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Uh... well....” She scratched her head in slight
embarrassment.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You’re too green to play the parents game with me,
young lady.” Mariko pulled her girlfriend into a snug embrace and tickled her.
They both laughed. It was only then did a question she had earlier suddenly
resurfaced. She stopped her tickling and quietly held her sweet girlfriend
tight. In response, An snuggled deeper into Mariko’s embrace and rest her head
against Mariko’s chest.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Can I ask you something, An?” she murmured atop her
sweetheart’s head.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Go ahead.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Why are you so cheerful today?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What do you mean?” The girl looked up at Mariko,
nonplussed.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Remember last week? You have seemed so depressed
then,” she explained, then stopped, not really knowing how to proceed. Perhaps
she shouldn’t have voiced her question at all.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Luckily for her, An understood. “I’ve been thinking
about us during the last week, Mariko,” the girl said, her expression growing
melancholic, her voice distant. “The more I considered, the more I realized
that I’d been doing the wrong things all along.” Her hand rose to comb through
Mariko’s flowing tresses. “In two weeks, you’ll be half a world away,” she
continued, “there are better things for me to do than brooding about your
departure. I finally understood that it’s more important that I spend these two
weeks having with you instead.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko gazed at her lover, sensing warmth welling in
her soul.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’ve been very childish, haven’t I? I’m sorry,” An
murmured, her voice racked with shame. She turned her head away.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No, don’t be!” Mariko told her sweetheart. “It just
shows how much you love me, and I truly appreciate it.” She cupped An’s face and
turned it so they could look into each other’s eyes. Then she kissed her. “I’m
very proud of you, An,” she whispered tenderly. “Do I have to keep telling you
that having you for a girlfriend is the most fortunate thing that has ever
happened to me?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Well...” the love of her life whispered back, “I
won’t mind if you say that every once in a while.” A smile blossomed on her
lips and lit up her face.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko laughed and moved in to kiss the high school
freshman again. Quickly enough, the meeting of lips grew passionate and
rekindled the flame that had practically burned Mariko inside out before An
carried her to the bed. Almost soundlessly, the blanket that had been hiding
her nakedness was untied and fell to the bed. Before she knew it, her hands
were tugging at the hem of An’s shirt, trying to lift it up and reveal to her
once more the wonder lying beneath the thin fabric.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">When she woke up with her girlfriend sleeping soundly
within her embrace the morning after, which was heralded by the sunlight
beating on her window’s blinds and the digital clock that read seven thirty
atop her desk, she reached for her cell phone nearby to check whether she had
any new messages.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">To her surprise, she saw that the thing had been shut
down, which she didn’t recall doing. Frowning, she turned the power back on,
flipped open the electronic device... and was informed by the log that
twenty-seven calls had reached it last night, at least ten of which were before
the phone itself went offline, which were never picked up. She knew why. Her
reckless abandon with An must have occupied enough of her attention to render
her oblivious to the ring tone. Yet... she didn’t believe it mattered whether
she had heard or not, though. She doubted she was going to answer the calls in
any case.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko felt a blush creeping onto her cheeks as she
stole a quick glance at the stunningly beautiful figure being snuggled warmly
in the curves of her arms. <i>‘How could I let go of her just because of a
phone call?’</i> she thought. The Gods standing witness, even if the Prime
Minister knocked on her door last night, she would still leave the man standing
there until she had time for him.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After placing a soft peck on her girlfriend’s
forehead, she checked for the identity of the callers. She froze. All
twenty-seven calls were placed by only one person... and that person was her
mom, Misono Madoka. The smile slipped off her lips in an instant while a
feeling of unease wormed its way into her mind. In her euphoric state, she had
but forgotten that aside from solicitors who just wanted to advertise new
wheelchair models each month, Madoka was the one person who called from work
every day to make sure nothing had happened to Mariko at home. Madoka must have
been worried sick last night to have placed this many phone calls. With guilt
nettling her heart, Mariko dialed her mom’s number.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">While she was waiting for the line to be connected,
she took another glance at her sweet girlfriend and considered withdrawing her
arm. She rejected the idea almost instantly. Although it might feel terribly
weird for her to talk to her <i>mom</i> with a girl sleeping naked in her arms,
she didn’t have the heart, or the will, to let go of her sweetheart, who was
clinging to Mariko with such a blissful expression on her adorable face.
Sighing, she held An even closer, pulled the blanket up a little bit higher to
make sure the girl wouldn’t get cold, and waited for Madoka to pick up the
phone.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Where were you last night?” Madoka demanded, concern
and fury warring in her voice. She hadn’t sounded this angry since the time
Mariko drank half of her wine bottle.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Swallowing uneasily, she answered with a voice as low
as possible so that she wouldn’t wake her beloved, “Home, mom.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Then why didn’t you pick up the <i>damn</i> phone?”
her mom’s voice thundered and made her give a small start, which in turn caused
An to stir softly in her arms. Thankfully, the brown-haired girl continued to
stay in the world of dreams, absolutely oblivious to the disaster that was
descending on Mariko’s head.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry, mom,” she said ruefully.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Sorry doesn’t cut it!” Madoka fired back. “Can you
imagine how worried I was?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m sorry,” Mariko repeated, feeling worse with every
second that passed. Here she was last night, having fun with her girlfriend
while her mother, the one who had cared for her with utmost devotion during the
last ten years, tried to reach her all night in the fear that something had
happened to her. Madoka deserved better than this.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">There was a moment of silence on the phone, during
which Mariko was under the impression that her mom was trying to calm herself
down. Madoka’s deepening breaths only confirmed her guess. Mariko’s heart went
out to her. Madoka, ever since the death of her husband and the disablement of
her daughter’s legs, had been subjected to great stress, which led to her high
blood pressure. As a result, she needed to take her medicine every day or she
wouldn’t be able to endure the amount of work that was piled upon her
shoulders. Mariko only hoped that her negligence last night didn’t antagonize
her mother too much.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“What happened?” Madoka asked, sounding much calmer
despite the steely and thin quality of her voice.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko found herself at a loss for words. She never
lied to her mom in her entire life, and she never wanted to.... <i>‘Yet do I
dare reveal the truth?’ </i>she thought bitterly. <i>‘Do I dare tell her that I
ignored her calls because I was making love to An?’</i> Being aware of just
exactly what kind of emotions Madoka harbored toward the Touyou Eiwa freshman,
Mariko couldn’t help but realize that the knowledge might just become a knife
that plunged into Madoka’s already fragile heart.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Mariko? Are you still there?” she demanded.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Ah yes,” Mariko hastily answered. “Nothing happened,
mom. I just had a terrible headache yesterday so I switched the phone to
vibrate mode and went to sleep. I’m sorry, mom.” <i>‘For lying to you,’</i> she
finished mentally.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Are you feeling okay?” Madoka’s voice softened
immediately, which made Mariko feel even more terrible. “Did you eat enough?
Did you take medicine afterwards?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Yeah, I’m alright. I had the stew you left before I
went to bed. It was delicious, mom.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It’s good then.” She could almost picture her mom
smiling in relief on the other side of the phone. “Do try to take care of
yourself, Mariko,” Madoka added, concern once again back in her words.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I will,” Mariko promised.<i> ‘For your sake, for An’s
sake, for my own sake,’ </i>she thought.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’ll be home tomorrow afternoon,” Madoka announced.
“The stew should be enough to cover you until then.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Not tonight, mom?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No. The business meeting was lengthier and more
complicated than what we expected,” we, meaning Madoka and her supervisor, “so
it’ll take a little bit more time.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I see,” Mariko said, trying to guard her voice as
much as possible. On one hand, she was slightly worried that Madoka had to
spend extra time and effort on her job. On the other hand... she was happy to
know that she could still spend another day... and another night with the one
she loved. She wasn’t very proud of herself... but she couldn’t help but feeling
the way she did.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh, my boss is calling for me,” her mom said. “I have
to go. Remember what I said, Mariko. Take care of yourself.” She hung up.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After she put her cell phone back where it was, she
looked at the cuddly girl in her arms and was surprised to see that her
girlfriend was looking at her with those adorable deep blue eyes.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">She greeted the love of her life with a light kiss on
her lips. “Hi there.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Good morning,” An said and burrowed deeper into
Mariko’s embrace. “Did you sleep well?” the seventeen-year-old murmured
drowsily against Mariko’s neck.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Very,” she answered, smiling inwardly. <i>‘With you
here by my side, how could I not?’ </i>“How about you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Not well at all,” her girlfriend said and gave a
tremulous yawn. She sounded very tired. “Every time I managed to close my eyes,
your cell phone rang and woke me up. I’m a very light sleeper, you see.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“I’m so sorry,” Mariko apologized, feeling blood
suffusing her cheeks. Why was it that only she got a good night sleep when the
two people dearest to her barely slept a wink?</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“After the tenth time or so,” An continued, seemingly
unaware of what Mariko just said, “I turned it off. It’s partly because I was
growing irritated... and partly because you seemed to be sleeping so peacefully
that I didn’t want it to wake you up.” Her voice grew sheepish toward the end.
It was as if she was ashamed of what she did. “I’m sorry if I overstepped my
bounds.”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Mariko chuckled softly and assured her girlfriend,
“Don’t worry about that. It’s okay. But next time, be sure to wake me up if the
phone kept ringing, ne? It could be some emergency.” She brushed An’s hair
affectionately.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Okay.” The high school freshman smiled up at her.
“But who was it that called you?”</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“You didn’t hear me talking?” Mariko asked, surprised.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“No. I woke up moments before the call ended.” An
shook her head.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“It was my mom,” Mariko told her</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“Oh.” The brown-haired girl’s body, cuddly and soft
just a second before, tensed up at the mentioning of Madoka. “What did she
say?” she inquired uncomfortably.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">“She said she wasn’t going to be home until tomorrow
afternoon,” Mariko whispered into her sweetheart’s ear and placed a quick peck
on the girl’s cheek. “That means you can stay here for another day... with me.”
Then she kissed An deeply on the lips and tightened her arms around the Touyou
Eiwa freshman’s relaxing frame. One more day to spend by the side of the one
she loved, one more day to strengthen their bond before Mariko left for the
U.S., and one more day to relive the magical encounter that had kept them
spellbound. She only hoped their time together would be enough to help her
survive the one year she was going to spend apart from the one girl who had
grown to be more than a half of her existence.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:29.25pt;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:.5in"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"> </span></p>
