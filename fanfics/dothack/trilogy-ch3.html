<h1>Hack//Trilogy (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../dothack/index.html">.hack//SIGN</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../dothack/trilogy-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Mimiru swept forward, the redheaded Heavy Blade swinging her large sword 
to parry a Crimson Knight&#39;s attack. &quot;You&#39;d better give up now,&quot; the 
scantily clad warrior said to her firmly, &quot;or I won&#39;t be responsible for 
the consequences.&quot;

&quot;Never,&quot; the red armored figure growled.

&quot;So be it,&quot; Mimiru answered calmly, attacking swiftly and scoring a 
critical hit. The defeated Knight dropped, stunned, then she seemed to 
fade out into a phantom like version of herself.

Mimiru turned to sweep the battle field with her eyes, smiling in 
satisfaction as she saw that the tide was turning against the Crimson 
Knights. The Knights had always relied on sheer numbers rather than 
individual power, and now that was costing them badly as Subaru&#39;s more 
experienced force cut through them with surprising ease.

&quot;Look out!&quot; a woman&#39;s voice called in warning from right behind her and 
Mimiru jumped in alarm, whipping around to see an unfamiliar Long Arm 
parrying a Knight&#39;s attack.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Mimiru moved up to help while silently cursing her moment of 
distraction. Together they easily dealt with the Knight, then stood back 
to back as more of the enemy rushed to attack them. She realized that 
this Long Arm wasn&#39;t a high level character, but she made up for it with 
both cunning and determination.

Finally both of them lowered their weapons as the battle gradually ran 
down, the last bands of Crimson Knights throwing down their weapons. The 
Long Arm smiled slightly as she looked towards Mimiru, &quot;Well, that was a 
good fight.&quot;

Mimiru chuckled softly, noticing that the woman had two different 
colored eyes. She wore a chainmail vest and simple garb, looking like a 
fallen knight or a wandering warrior maybe. &quot;That it was,&quot; she hesitated 
then smiled, &quot;my name&#39;s Mimiru.&quot;

&quot;Kamui,&quot; the Long Arm nodded, leaning against her spear. She was about 
to say more, when they both saw that Subaru was confronting the current 
leader of the Crimson Knights.

Subaru looked surprisingly regal as the blue haired Heavy Axe gazed at 
the man, the two standing in the middle of the rebel army. &quot;Your forces 
have been beaten,&quot; she said with surprising gentleness, &quot;do you yield?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Lady Subaru,&quot; he sighed, his helm hiding much of his face.

&quot;I&#39;m not here to disband the Crimson Knights,&quot; Subaru pitched her voice 
so that it carried across the field, &quot;nor do I intend to take over.&quot; 
There was a murmur of surprise from the Knights as she continued, &quot;What 
we&#39;ve done, is give you a warning.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; the leader frowned.

Quietly Subaru explained to him, &quot;The Crimson Knights have angered many 
in the past few months and this is your wake up call.&quot; She flashed a 
smile, &quot;I personally have no objection to your maintaining the peace and 
trying to keep order in the World, but harming bystanders and innocents 
will not be tolerated.&quot;

&quot;In other words you beat us once,&quot; the lead Knight said wryly, &quot;and 
you&#39;ll do it again if we give you cause.&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Subaru agreed calmly.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Kamui murmured as they listened. She looked over at Mimiru and 
softly asked, &quot;Do you think she&#39;s doing the right thing, letting them 
go?&quot;

&quot;I think she&#39;s doing the only thing that she can do and stay true to 
herself,&quot; Mimiru answered her promptly. She stretched gracefully as she 
stowed her sword across her back, &quot;You joining in the victory 
celebration?&quot;

Kamui hesitated, &quot;Is it for long time players only, or...?&quot;

Mimiru gave her a smile, &quot;You were brave enough to fight beside us, you 
have every right to party with us too.&quot; The massive band of warriors 
moved off from the territory of the Crimson Knights then headed to the 
town and to one of many simulated pubs.

They collected drinks then studied the place, the crowds packed around 
many tables. A familiar figure waved them over to a table, Bear smiling 
in welcome. The big man looked at Mimiru curiously, &quot;Made a new friend?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Mimiru agreed. She introduced them, adding, 
&quot;Bear&#39;s an old friend of mine, as well as someone I&#39;ve always counted 
on.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an honor,&quot; Kamui shook his hand, sitting comfortably.

Mimiru tried to keep up with the conversation but she was distracted a 
bit by two figures in a corner. Tsukasa and Subaru talked together 
softly, the slim boy and young woman, both laughing and chatting 
intimately despite being surrounded by people, off in their own world. 
She looked away as an uncomfortable flash of jealousy flared within her 
only to meet Kamui&#39;s sympathetic eyes.

&quot;What?&quot; Mimiru asked crossly.

&quot;Don&#39;t mid her,&quot; Bear said with a slight smile, &quot;she&#39;s a barbarian a 
heart.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Mimiru protested, &quot;If anyone here is a barbarian, it&#39;s you.&quot;

Bear snickered as Kamui gave them a lopsided smile, &quot;Should I leave you 
two alone?&quot;

&quot;No thanks,&quot; Bear said calmly.

&quot;Sorry I got distracted,&quot; Mimiru said softly, &quot;he and I just have a 
history.&quot;

&quot;I know how that feels,&quot; Kamui agreed, nodding towards where Albireo and 
Hokuto talked cheerfully, the resemblance Kamui shared with Albireo 
remarkably obvious.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Mimiru murmured, having wondered at their connection when she saw 
they were so similar looking.

&quot;Where you two...&quot; Bear asked delicately.

&quot;No,&quot; Kamui shook her head, &quot;tho I suppose I thought about it a time or 
two.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;You could say he was my mentor.&quot;

&quot;From what I&#39;ve heard he&#39;s a good man, not to mention a legendary 
player,&quot; Bear noted. He smiled, &quot;He is one of the Descendants of Fianna, 
you know.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Mimiru squeaked out while Kamui looked blank. Seeing her 
companion&#39;s confusion Mimiru explained, &quot;The Descendants of Fianna 
fought in the battle against the One Sin and defeated it. and Albireo 
was there to witness it.&quot;

&quot;I never knew Albireo was famous,&quot; Kamui admitted.

&quot;The web poet W.B. Yates has mentioned him a few times,&quot; Bear noted.

Mimiru drank a bit, looking at Kamui thoughtfully before asking, &quot;Are 
you adventuring alone or in a group?&quot;

&quot;Mostly alone,&quot; Kamui admitted after a moment, &quot;or in pairs. Why?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t been in a group for awhile,&quot; Mimiru admitted, silently 
adding, &#39;not since Tsukasa, anyway.&#39; Briskly she continued, &quot;If you want 
to trade member addresses, we could form a party.&quot;

Kamui looked over at her in surprise and asked, &quot;We&#39;ve just met.. isn&#39;t 
it soon for you to be doing that?&quot;

Mimiru smiled, &quot;We fought side by side... that gives me a feel for what 
you&#39;re like. Besides, I think you&#39;ve got potential.&quot;

Kamui hesitated.. then decided to use the talk command to send her 
address over. &quot;I hope I don&#39;t regret this...&quot; she muttered.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Bear laughed as he got up to go, &quot;even if she gets you 
into trouble, it&#39;ll be interesting trouble.&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Mimiru rolled her eyes. She grinned at Kamui, &quot;We can get 
together a mixed party, that way we&#39;ll all work together better.&quot;

&quot;Already planning?&quot; Kamui asked, wondering a moment who Mimiru might be 
in real life. She was in her twenties but this girl was already bowling 
her over...

&quot;Someone&#39;s got to,&quot; Mimiru grinned.

Kamui chuckled, faintly surprised at how comfortable she felt with her. 
&quot;Guess so,&quot; she said as they put their heads together, planing out 
campaigns with an infectious eagerness.

End.

Notes: This story was written in an odd order, Part Two coming first. My 
idea was at first based on a one shot on Kamui, a character from the 
.Hack/ novels, but I realized it wouldn&#39;t work well on it&#39;s own. 
Therefore I added the .Hack/SIGN chapter, as well as a final story to 
wrap it all up. This story also ties in with my earlier fic, Hack Sign: 
Afterwards. These stories refer heavily to details in the .Hack novels, 
but hopefully are understandable without reading them.</pre>
