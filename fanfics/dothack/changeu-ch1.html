<h1>Real Life Can Change You</h1>

<pre>It was the day that they had scheduled to meet in real life.  Mimiru sat 
waiting outside of the train station for Tsukasa.  In real life, she 
looked much like her character in The World. (She even had the same dark 
tan)  The major difference was that her hair was down to her shoulders, 
but it was still styled the same way, quite spiky and disorderly.  She 
was wearing a loose fitting t-shirt and tight mid-length shorts.  She 
looked down to check her watch.  The train would be arriving soon.  She 
leaned back into the bench she was sitting on and crossed her arms 
behind her head, closing her eyes to the fierce glare of the sun.  She 
was beginning to feel a bit drowsy when she heard an uncertain voice say 
her name.

&quot;Mimiru?  Is that you?&quot;

She opened her eyes and looked up to see a younger girl with short light 
brown hair staring at her questioningly. Mimiru stood up; she was a good 
three inches taller than the girl that had addressed her.

&quot;Tsukasa?&quot;

Tsukasa nodded and a large grin began to spread on her face.  She looked 
and sounded almost exactly like she had in the game, with the exception 
that her voice sounded more feminine.  Mimiru looked her up and down, 
appraising the younger girl.  The grin Tsukasa was giving her was 
contagious and Mimiru smiled back.

&quot;So, what do you want to do, Tsukasa?  We could go shopping or just head 
to my house or something.&quot;

&quot;Um.well, I don&#39;t really mind what we do, but I guess we could go to 
your house.&quot;

Tsukasa shrugged while saying this.

&quot;Well, my house isn&#39;t far away so I guess we could walk there.  Do you 
mind?&quot;

Tsukasa shook her head, she liked walking, and she liked it even more 
when it was with Mimiru.  They began to walk down the street, talking 
about whatever came to mind, Mimiru occasionally waving to people she 
knew.

&quot;So, Tsukasa, is there anyone that you like?&quot;

Tsukasa was at a loss at what to say, so she decided to lie.

&quot;No, not really.  Why?  Is there someone you like, Mimiru?&quot;

&quot;Um.&quot; She was caught off guard by the question, just as Tsukasa must 
have been. &quot;Yes, but I&#39;m not sure if they know or not.&quot;

She sighed.  Tsukasa&#39;s heart jumped, if Mimiru liked someone then there 
was the possibility that it was her.  Mimiru looked over at Tsukasa, who 
quickly looked away from Mimiru, who she had been staring at, admiring 
her beauty.  Tsukasa continued walking, lost in thought, when she ran 
into Mimiru&#39;s outstretched arm.  She turned to Mimiru with a confused 
look on her face.  Mimiru pointed to the house they had stopped in front 
of, showing that it was hers.

&quot;Wow!  Your house is huge, Mimiru!&quot;

&quot;Thanks Tsukasa.&quot;  She smiled at Tsukasa&#39;s astounded look.  &quot;Is Bear&#39;s 
house small?&quot;

&quot;No, but yours is bigger.&quot;

&quot;Well, let&#39;s go in and drop your stuff off in my room.  How long will 
you be staying anyway?&quot;

&quot;Um, just a couple of days I guess.&quot;

&quot;Okay, well, I&#39;ll show you to my room.  Do you want to stay in my room 
or a guest room?&quot;  Mimiru was asking these questions as they walked up 
the sidewalk.

&quot;I&#39;d rather stay in your room, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s fine.  If it wasn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have offered.&quot;  Tsukasa 
blushed at her own utter stupidity.  Mimiru led Tsukasa up two flights 
of stairs, and down a long hallway.  They stopped at a closed door that 
had a plaque on it reading: Mimiru.

&quot;Well, here it is.&quot;  Mimiru performed at little bow that made Tsukasa 
laugh.  Mimiru smiled at this.  She opened the door and put her hand on 
the small of Tsukasa&#39;s back, gently pushing her into her room.  
Tsukasa&#39;s almost began to drool at the sight of the lavishly furnished 
room.  Mimiru&#39;s queen-sized bed was against the wall on the far side of 
the huge.  Just a few feet away from the bed was the computer, the 
headset was resting atop the monitor.  There were various anime and 
gaming posters and scrolls littering the walls, as if they were 
wallpaper.

&quot;You like?&quot;

&quot;Oh, very much!&quot;

&quot;Hey, I have another headset if you wanna log onto the world.that is if 
you&#39;re ready to play again.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine.I&#39;d love to play.&quot;  Mimiru pulled the other headset out of a 
drawer in the computer desk and hooked it up.  She clicked on a shortcut 
on her desktop, quickly connecting them to the Altimit homepage.  Mimiru 
clicked on the link for &quot;The World&quot;, and they entered their passwords.  
They then spent the next five or so hours playing &quot;The World&quot;, only 
taking a break to eat dinner, which consisted of pizza and French 
fries.mmm.  They even met up with Subaru, forming a party to go complete 
a special event.

By the time they had finished, it was about 11 o&#39;clock.  Mimiru asked 
Tsukasa what she wanted to do, and Tsukasa suggested watching a movie.  
Mimiru&#39;s parents had gone out, so they used the big screen TV 
downstairs.  Mimiru popped a scary movie into the DVD player and sat 
down next to Tsukasa on the couch.  The two of them sat watching 
wide-eyed until a particularly frightening part, when Tsukasa jumped and 
clung to Mimiru&#39;s arm.  Since Mimiru voiced no objection, Tsukasa stayed 
like this until the end of the movie.  When it did end, Tsukasa had her 
head leaning on Mimiru&#39;s shoulder and had fallen asleep.  Mimiru looked 
down at her sleeping form and smiled.  She gently lifted Tsukasa up in 
her arms and carried her up to the bedroom.  She placed her carefully 
into the bed and then climbed in next to her, covering them both with 
the sheets.  Mimiru brushed a few locks of hair off of Tsukasa&#39;s face 
and placed a soft kiss on her forehead.

&quot;Sleep well, Tsukasa.&quot;

-A few hours later-

She awoke to the feeling of someone cuddling up to her.  Opening her 
eyes, she saw Tsukasa snuggled up tightly to her body.  Mimiru, thinking 
she was sleeping, slowly put her arm around her waist to pull her 
closer.  Tsukasa looked up at Mimiru, and they both blushed.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Both of them said simultaneously.  Mimiru giggled, but was 
silenced by the feel of Tsukasa&#39;s lips on hers.  Tsukasa put one arm 
around Mimiru&#39;s waist and the other on the back of her head.  Mimiru 
pulled back, breathing heavily.

&quot;I love you Tsukasa.&quot;</pre>
