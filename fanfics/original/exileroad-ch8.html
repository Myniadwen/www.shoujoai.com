<a href="../original/exileroad-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Commander Hudson smiled slightly, the grizzled old
soldier reviewing the paperwork that cluttered his
desk. It was almost like a curse, he mused, that as
soon as he got rid of some of it, more papers would
turn up to take it&#39;s place.

&quot;Commander?&quot; the voice said and Hudson smiled. He had
heard the man coming up the hall, his armor rattling.

&quot;Knight Daniel,&quot; Hudson nodded to the brown haired
young nobleman, &quot;how can I help you?&quot; Of course the
commander rather suspected he knew why the man was
here, but it never really hurt to be sure.

&quot;I&#39;ve returned from the eastern lands as requested,&quot;
Daniel said formerly, &quot;and talked to the Bardic Guilds
there. They have vowed that they will quest for the
information you seek about the mercenary fighter
Midori.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Hudson smiled wryly. It wasn&#39;t that the city
and kingdom didn&#39;t have... agents scattered about, but
the bards did this sort of thing so much better.

&quot;M&#39;lord,&quot; Dan hesitated, &quot;could I ask you a question?&quot;

&quot;You want to know why I&#39;m looking for information on
Midori?&quot; Hudson looked at him seriously. A slight
smile appeared as the boy nodded, &quot;There are some
reasons you don&#39;t need to know, but consider this:
Midori may know, even without being aware, who leads
the Genin assassins here. Learning more about her
could help us stop them.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Dan admitted the point, if a bit
reluctantly.

&quot;I don&#39;t much like going back on my word,&quot; Hudson said
with a weary sigh, &quot;but in this case it seems that I
must.&quot;

Dan bowed slightly, &quot;M&#39;lord, I will return to my
family&#39;s home then, and await the call to arms.&quot; With
that he turned, red cape swirling as he strode off and
the commander sighed.

&quot;Someone let him read too many books on chivalry
growing up,&quot; Hudson muttered fondly. Still, Dan was a
good man, not to mention being one of his most
reliable. Not too terribly bright, but still reliable.

One of the young boys who served as pages and
messengers arrived, his sandy hair falling into his
eyes. &quot;M&#39;lord,&quot; he bowed, &quot;news from the castle.&quot;

&quot;Trouble, Sam?&quot; Hudson narrowed his eyes.

&quot;No sir,&quot; Sam shook his head, a slight smile on his
face, &quot;one of the palace guards sent us a update on
Lady Jantha.&quot; He looked mildly amused, &quot;It seemed that
to get Laur&#39;ien in, they had to disguise her as a
maid.&quot;

&quot;Maid?&quot; Hudson chuckled, trying to imagine the tawny
haired, irreverent officer running around dressed in a
maid&#39;s uniform. It was, in all honesty, a little hard
to do. He shook off his amusement and asked seriously,
&quot;Anything new to report?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; Sam conceded, &quot;the only surprise was the
appearance of the ambassador of Edo at the palace.&quot;

&quot;Sasoke?&quot; Hudson blinked, remembering the elderly man.
&quot;I thought he was still out of favor with the new
Shogun?&quot; he recalled.

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; Sam nodded, &quot;but oddly he spoke for a time
privately with the mercenary Midori.&quot;

That got Hudson&#39;s attention. &quot;Did the guards note what
they said?&quot; he asked curiously.

Sam drew a piece of paper from his tunic as he noted,
&quot;They switched to some foreign tongue, m&#39;lord, but he
did call her something odd.&quot; He frowned as he read the
other guard&#39;s note, &quot;Midori-dono, I think.&quot; He looked
up, catching the stunned look on Hudson&#39;s face,
&quot;M&#39;lord?&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hudson said formally, taking the note
from Sam, &quot;is this a exact transcription?&quot;

&quot;Written by his own hand,&quot; Sam agreed.

He saluted and left, leaving Hudson with his troubling
thoughts. &#39;If I hadn&#39;t led a expedition to the east,&#39;
he thought, &#39;I wouldn&#39;t have recognized the
honorific.&#39; He looked down at the note, &#39;The high
ranking ambassador called Midori a lord, so who is
that woman?&#39;

Getting up from his desk Hudson strode through the
halls of the barracks, considering. He didn&#39;t
understand the rankings of Edo as well as he should,
his experience had mostly been back when he was a
younger soldier. The Shogun ruled over the land, then
below him were the commanders of each region. But
where would an ambassador rank?

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Hudson growled, shaking his head. He just
didn&#39;t know enough to make an opinion... he just had
to hope that he heard back from the bards soon. At the
very least, Midori was a woman of rank, if not
possibly royal. &#39;Which means things may be even more
complicated than I thought,&#39; he mused.

Queen Gwen studied the two soldiers even as the slim
blonde led them and her cousin into her private
chambers, considering them the way that she had been
trained to as both a diplomat and royal. She
recognized the tawny haired maid as Laur&#39;ien, one of
Commander Hudson&#39;s &#39;special&#39; troops, a shapeshifter.
She had been brought up as a discipline problem
several times, but was also one of Hudson&#39;s best.

&#39;Not too surprising,&#39; Gwen conceded, &#39;unconventional
thinking is also often coupled to an independent
spirit.&#39;

The other woman was cut from a different mold, and
Gwen studied her a bit more carefully. The dark haired
woman had a foreign cast to her features, from what
Gwen remembered she might be from the eastern lands,
possibly Edo or China. She handled herself with a calm
surety, even in the presence of royalty, and even
warily watched the guards that hovered at the edges of
the room.

&#39;Like a good bodyguard should,&#39; Gwen thought
approvingly.

Jantha relaxed a little once they were out of the main
hall, smiling with a more honest sort of warmth. &quot;So
how goes the political dealings?&quot; she asked as they
walked to a table, Gwen gesturing them to take their
seats.

&quot;Better than expected,&quot; Gwen took the head seat,
sitting with a sigh. &quot;The nearby lands are cautious,
understandably, but my royal cousins seem willing to
support me.&quot;

&quot;But those not related by blood?&quot; Jantha asked.

&quot;They are a different problem,&quot; Gwen conceded. &quot;There
is little that I can offer them,&quot; she noted, &quot;and no
bond of blood for loyalty.&quot;

&quot;There is always the option of political marriages,&quot;
Jantha said quietly, meeting her sister&#39;s gaze
directly.

&#39;And you would hate me forever if I married you off to
one of those dolts,&#39; Gwen thought, &#39;but thank you for
offering.&#39; Aloud she said, &quot;We will save that as a
last resort, I think.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jantha smiled wearily.

Gwen looked over at Laur&#39;ien and Midori, &quot;And what do
you think?&quot;

Laur&#39;ien smiled wryly, &quot;I try not to think, I&#39;m a
soldier m&#39;lady.&quot;

Gwen fought back a laugh at the lady&#39;s supposed
innocence. &quot;Please tell that to some of my generals,&quot;
she answered, &quot;they think far too much at times.&quot;

Jantha looked disapproving, &quot;The officers that you
inherited from the former king are still giving you
trouble?&quot;

&quot;I think they are still having a bit of trouble with
having a queen,&quot; Gwen answered her dryly. She looked
over at Midori, &quot;And what do you think, easterner?&quot;

Midori met here eyes coolly, the woman&#39;s expression
grave, &quot;Kill the general who is the most obstinate, I
suspect that the rest will soon fall into line.&quot;

&quot;Midori!&quot; Jantha burst out.

&quot;She asked for my opinion,&quot; Midori said with a shrug,
&quot;I granted it.&quot;

&quot;And in truth I suspect it&#39;s good wisdom,&quot; Gwen
admitted. She smiled slightly, &quot;But it&#39;s a road that
once you start down, you cannot go back.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Midori acknowledged.</pre>
