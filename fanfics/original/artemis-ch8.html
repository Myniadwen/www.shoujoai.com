<a href="../original/artemis-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Circe smiled as she greeted Jess Drake at the door,
studying the bedraggled figure of the magician with
some concern. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; the blonde asked
worriedly, leading her inside the Daughters of
Artemis.

Jess smiled back wryly, her short black hair falling
into her eyes. &quot;Had a hell of a day,&quot; she admitted,
&quot;but if you need me, I&#39;m ready to help.&quot; Dressed in
casual jeans, shirt and jacket Jess still looked good,
no matter how tired she was.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to call another circle so soon,&quot; Circe said
as she led Jess into the mostly deserted bar, &quot;but I
screwed up one of the enchantments we cast last time,
there&#39;s a chink in our armor.&quot;

&quot;The cross-dimensional element,&quot; Jess didn&#39;t exactly
ask.

Circe looked at her in surprise, &quot;How did you know?&quot;

Jess smiled back tiredly, &quot;First time I&#39;ve ever heard
of somebody pulling something like that. I figure it&#39;s
new, and the first time I try spells, something almost
always goes wrong.&quot;

Circe had to chuckle, &quot;Fair enough.&quot;

The circle wasn&#39;t a formal group of magicians and
wizards, in fact the membership shifted greatly as
people came and left town or became known to Diana and
Circe. Today there was Circe herself, Jess, a Japanese
exchange student named Yamato Tsujimoto, the redheaded
Irish scholar Shannon Mcgee, Ema Wilson and Jess&#39;
friend Elizabeth all ready and waiting.

&quot;It took you long enough,&quot; Elizabeth smirked, the slim
little blonde eyeing Jess closely.

Jess ignored that, taking off her coat and sitting it
on a bar stool. &quot;So what, exactly, are we doing?&quot; she
asked crisply.

&quot;Tha&#39; was what I was wonderin&#39;,&quot; Shannon softly
agreed, a curl of her red hair touching her rosy
cheek. The dress that she wore was a bit snug, but the
body beneath it was, in all honesty, rather
under-endowed.

&quot;I need the circle to call up power for me and to be
an anchor,&quot; Circe explained simply, &quot;while I repair
the bar&#39;s shielding spells.&quot; A smile, &quot;It shouldn&#39;t
take long.&quot;

&quot;Assuming things don&#39;t go wrong,&quot; Ema spoke up shyly,
her long brown hair falling over round glasses, &quot;and
they ALWAYS seem to go wrong.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;ll be shielding too,&quot; Yamato said
thoughtfully. Black hair shimmered in a wave down her
back, the white shirt and red pants she wore almost
painted on her curvy form.

&quot;Any problems?&quot; Circe looked the group over then
nodded, &quot;Then let&#39;s do this.&quot;

Circe took the position at the head of the circle, Ema
to her right and Shannon to her left, Jess across from
her with Yamato and Elizabeth beside her. Each
extended their hands to the other, then they settled
down into building power in their own various ways.

Nearby Diana watched and waited, the co-owner of the
bar slightly tense as she leaned up against the
counter. From out of the back a skinny, somewhat
intense blonde emerged to join her, rather oddly
wearing a sword belted at her side. &quot;I&#39;m glad you two
decided to tell me this was happening this time,&quot;
Athena said seriously.

&quot;Just being careful,&quot; Diana answered, long brown hair
tied back smoothly.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Athena asked, frowning slightly.

&quot;Father may be more aware of us than we had thought,&quot;
Diana said honestly, &quot;if he does take a shot at the
bar, I want you here to back us up.&quot;

&quot;Marvelous,&quot; Athena growled, eyes narrowing.

The circle began to glow as the mystical energies that
it&#39;s members were gathering slowly built, shimmering
all around them. Dancing from woman to woman their
energies gradually flowed into Circe only to be
released into the bar&#39;s defenses, strengthening and
repairing the flaws that only use could have
discovered.

The front doors rattled suddenly, cutting over the
magicians&#39; murmuring voices then the locked doors
slammed open violently. He looked almost normal, the
gray bearded man in a trench coat he stood in the
doorway, something physically preventing him from
entering the room. His eyes glittered an ice blue, his
lips drew back in a grimace as he pushed against the
invisible barrier.

&quot;What the HELL is that,&quot; Elizabeth growled as the
entire circle was stressed to the max, the power
suddenly opposing them immense.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Athena led the charge around the circle to
the doorway, drawing her blade smoothly. The vary air
rippled and she seemed to shirt, casual clothes fading
to roman style armor as she fully took on her aspect
of Goddess of War.

Diana held a simple bow in her hands but as she drew
the string back, energy flickered to life I the shape
of a arrow. Her clothes blurred replaced by the rough
garb of a huntress, fur cloak casually flung over her
shoulders. &quot;Zeus,&quot; Diana met his eyes fiercely as they
faced each other, &quot;get the hell away from my bar.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve fallen so far, little bitch,&quot; the old man&#39;s
voice rumbled as Zeus continued, &quot;and how would you
stop me?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see you crossing the doorway, pops,&quot; Athena
shot back, Zeus&#39; lips drawing back in a snarl of
sudden rage.

&quot;DONE!&quot; Circe called out as a wave of power pulsed
out, the very air around the bar lightening as the
defenses around them firmed up even more.

With a anguished cry Zeus was thrown backwards by the
mystic defenses around the bar, his clothes and beard
literally smoking as he collapsed to the ground.
Pulling himself up on the sidewalk he howled, &quot;You&#39;ll
pay for that, whores!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Diana answered calmly. &quot;you&#39;re too far from your
sources of power, father and you face far more than
two little goddesses.&quot;

Zeus looked almost incoherent with rage, eyes flashing
as he managed to get out, &quot;Your little sanctuary won&#39;t
protect you forever.&quot; With a crack of thunder and
burst of lightning he was gone, leaving no sign he was
ever there.

Into the silence Jess murmured, &quot;When Hunter told me
you needed me for a circle tonight I joked that you
were trying to stave off the wrath of god.&quot; A wry
smile, &quot;Didn&#39;t expect to be right.&quot;

Circe and the other magic users were getting up, all
of them feeling more than a bit exhausted by what had
just happened. &quot;Is that a problem?&quot; Circe asked
curiously.

&quot;Sounds like a hell of a fight,&quot; Jess said with a
slight smile, &quot;you need me, I&#39;m in.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Diana said as she put the bow away, Athena
shedding her armor mystically. The magicians chimed in
their support, the circle breaking up as they tiredly
scattered around the room.

&quot;First round is on me, everyone,&quot; Circe laughed,
stepping up to the bar to help her lover pass around
the foam topped mugs of beer.

&quot;I was a little surprised at how well they took that,&quot;
Athena noted, even as the main doors were opened and
some of the more regular customers came in.

&quot;Wait until we actually need them to help,&quot; Diana
noted cynically as they passed a second round of
drinks around, soon to be followed by a third. Her
expression softened a little, &quot;Though I suppose we can
count on Jess&#39; help....&quot;

Circe looked amused as she nodded towards a corner
table where Jess was sitting, several empty mugs of
beer in front of her. &quot;I think she&#39;s a bit busy, too,&quot;
she smiled as a woman approached.

&quot;Hello, lover,&quot; Elizabeth purred, the slim blonde
snuggling up to Jess&#39; back.

Jess coldly shrugged her off, &quot;Watch the hands.&quot; She
turned slightly to look at her, again struck by how
lovely and yet how shallow the woman seemed. &quot;Don&#39;t
you have someone else to bother tonight?&quot; she asked
her wryly.

&quot;No one as exciting as you,&quot; Elizabeth smirked. With a
little laugh she perched on Jess lap, wrapping her
arms around the taller woman to snuggle close.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to do this today,&quot; Jess reflexedly
steadied the girl with her hand as she continued,
&quot;I&#39;ve had a real shitty day today and I&#39;m not in the
mood.&quot;

&quot;But Jess.....&quot; Elizabeth started to say then trailed
off as she looked over Jess&#39; shoulder and murmured,
&quot;uh oh.&quot;

Jess turned around slightly only to freeze in
surprise. Alice Sinclaire stood there, the black
haired beauty looking at the two of them with a face
made pale by shock and other emotions. Hunter stood
behind her with an apologetic look and Jess instantly
realized that she had brought Alice here, probably to
give the two of them a chance to make up.

&quot;You... you...&quot; Alice shook a moment then stepped
forward as Elizabeth scampered away and slapped Jess
across the face, then turned and fled.

&quot;Shit,&quot; Jess cursed softly as she tried to get up, the
beer that she had drank making her too wobbly to
pursue Alice. Hunter reached out to steady her and
Jess was surprised to see a tear in the other woman&#39;s
eyes.

&quot;I never meant....&quot; Hunter said weakly.

Jess shrugged off Hunter&#39;s hand and bolted from the
bar, vainly trying to pursue Alice. &quot;Oh hell,&quot; Circe
sighed, leaving the others to watch the bar and
following Jess outside.

Jess had collapsed out in the parking lot, keeling on
the concrete all alone. Tears streaked the dark haired
woman&#39;s face even as her cheek went flaming red, her
voice coming pout in choking sobs as she gasped, &quot;I&#39;m
so stupid!&quot; Circe didn&#39;t really know what was going
on, but there was really only one thing she could do.
Kneeling beside Jess she drew her close and let the
other woman cry.</pre>
