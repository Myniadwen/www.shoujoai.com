    &quot;Yae?&quot;

    The morose tomboy looked up at her from her bed, her sleepy
daydream of Tataku&#39;s voice broken by the real thing. She didn&#39;t know
whether to be glad of that or not. At least in her dream she would
have heard what she wanted to hear. Life was beginning to seem
particularly cruel right now, so what was one more pain to cry over?

    &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I never should have said those things.&quot;

    Tataku&#39;s apologetic eyes didn&#39;t meet Yae&#39;s gaze as the pilot began
to smile, the hope finally beginning to seep back. All Tataku saw was
her own feet, and the ground she wished would reach up and swallow her
for being such a fool. &quot;I know it was cruel of me, but I didn&#39;t know
what to think any more. My life has never managed to get this
complicated before. Please forgive me.&quot;

    All of a sudden Yae didn&#39;t feel like dreaming any more. She got up
as the smile slowly lit up her face, reaching out to take Tataku&#39;s
chin in her hand and raise it to her own. &quot;Like there&#39;s anything to
forgive. Come here.&quot;

    Tataku melted into the embrace as Yae wrapped her arms around her,
feeling the beat of her girlfriend&#39;s heart against her own. &quot;I&#39;ve
missed this so much,&quot; she said, her mind finally at ease.

    &quot;Me too,&quot; Yae sighed, wishing she was a little taller so she could
do this properly. &quot;And I&#39;m going to say it first this time. I love
you.&quot;

    Tataku giggled a little as she felt her eyes moisten. &quot;You&#39;re so
strange. Should I feel like I&#39;ve lost because I love you too? ...And I
do you know.&quot;

    Yae had to chuckle herself. &quot;That&#39;s not what I meant, and I know
you do, but it feels so much better to hear it. And you got to say it
first last time, so it&#39;s my turn.&quot;

    &quot;You didn&#39;t know,&quot; Tataku said timidly, &quot;that&#39;s why I had to say
it. You looked so depressed.&quot;

    &quot;I think we&#39;ve all got the right to be depressed right now, but
it&#39;ll work out somehow. I promise.&quot;

    Tataku pulled reluctantly away to see Yae&#39;s eyes. &quot;Please don&#39;t
make promises like that. I told you...&quot;

    But Yae didn&#39;t let her finish. &quot;I just did, and I mean it. Come
on, let&#39;s talk about something else. We&#39;ll get enough of this stuff
later.&quot;

    Tataku nodded and lay her head back next to Yae&#39;s. &quot;...I can&#39;t
think of anything to talk about.&quot;

    &quot;Me neither actually, but I do know what else I get to do first.&quot;

    &quot;What?&quot; the green haired girl asked, only to have Yae&#39;s lips meet
her own as she raised her head.

    They both smiled as they parted, a faint blush colouring their
cheeks. &quot;I&#39;ve missed that too,&quot; said Tataku shyly.

    Yae just responded by kissing her again.

    After the kiss had faded Yae scratched her head a little as she
tried to suppress her yawn. It was a real mood killer, but she was
really tired. &quot;I&#39;m glad you wanted to stay,&quot; she said, trying to end
the conversation gently. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to think about it ending like
that. Now I can definitely have good dreams. I&#39;m gonna head for bed,
okay?&quot;

    Tataku nodded, and began to leave when a realisation hit her; she
was exhausted too. She turned back into the room only to end up facing
the doorway again, her face beginning to burn red at seeing Yae
stripping off.

    &quot;Oh, err, sorry,&quot; Yae said as she threw off the rest of her
clothing and pulled herself into the small top and shorts she slept
in. &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m decent. What&#39;s up?&quot;

    &quot;Oh, n-nothing, I was just being silly again. Goodnight.&quot;

    &quot;Wait,&quot; called Yae as Tataku stepped to the door again,
&quot;seriously, what is it? I can stay up a bit if you want to talk.&quot;

    &quot;I w-was just thinking if I c-could sleep with you but...&quot; At
Yae&#39;s surprised expression she started waving her hands in denial. &quot;N-
no, I didn&#39;t m-mean, it was j-just that I&#39;m t-tired but I w-wanted to
stay with... N-never mind!&quot;

    However Yae was ready to catch her as she started to scurry off.
&quot;Tataku-chan,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;you&#39;re welcome to if you want. I&#39;d like
that to.&quot;

    Tataku looked round to her cautiously. &quot;You would?&quot;

    &quot;Don&#39;t be silly, of course I would. And you look so cute in that
nightie of yours!&quot;

    Tataku blushed as she let Yae lead her back inside. Ten minutes
later Tataku lay curled up with her hands tucked up beside her face as
Yae&#39;s arms encircled her from behind, both of them fast asleep.

***

    Jei sighed as she began to pour herself another weak coffee.
Everything had finally caught up to her, and that little voice was
doing its &#39;I told you so&#39; routine. But for the first time since
meeting everyone it wasn&#39;t trying to put her down or pick her mind
apart. It was just there. Almost commiserating with her.

    &quot;You gonna be okay Jei-Jei?&quot; Angelica asked from the doorway. Jei
still confounded her, but she was beginning to get how to deal with
her when she was like this. &quot;This is the bit where you tell me what&#39;s
up.&quot;

    &quot;There&#39;s nothing to say.&quot;

    Angelica shook her head and perched herself on the countertop.
&quot;Yeah right. You&#39;re just gonna let them get you?&quot;

    &quot;Yes,&quot; Jei nodded, &quot;what else is there to do?&quot;

    Angelica smirked, &quot;We could hook up with the resistance movement
on Olto. That&#39;d show them!&quot;

    &quot;You&#39;d like that, wouldn&#39;t you. The intrigue, action, the whole
bit.&quot;

    &quot;Nahh,&quot; the outlaw said, waving it off, &quot;I do my own thing, but
it&#39;s a possibility.&quot;

    Jei took a long sip of her coffee before sitting down at the
table, facing the wall. &quot;No, it isn&#39;t. I could cope with keeping a low
profile, but I can&#39;t hide. I couldn&#39;t live like that. I won&#39;t let
anyone lead my life for me.&quot;

    Angelica smirked slightly. &quot;So says the submissive one.&quot;

    &quot;Shut up!&quot;

    &quot;Hey,&quot; she soothed, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean nothin&#39; by that. Everyone&#39;s got
a vulnerable side, right? You want a protector sometimes, I&#39;m there. I
ain&#39;t lettin&#39; them take you anywhere.&quot;

    &quot;I killed Laura.&quot;

    Angelica blinked, caught totally off guard. &quot;W-what?&quot;

    &quot;I killed her. The second they were at safe distance I detonated
the cargo they took. I destroyed your ship, killed your crew, and I
enjoyed it.&quot;

    Angelica could feel herself going numb as she got off the counter.
&quot;T-that&#39;s a hell of a thing to say Jei. After... after...&quot;

    Jei didn&#39;t say anything else. She just stared forlornly into her
coffee.

    Angelica would have taken her head off in a second if things
hadn&#39;t been the way they were, but they were. &quot;I don&#39;t get it. Why?
Why all this? She was like family to me, and I was gettin&#39; over losing
everythin&#39;, and now... You can&#39;t just say it like that! You&#39;re lyin&#39;!
You said Jhonas was the only one you saw! For all you knew he was
there on his own! I want the truth!&quot;

    Jei didn&#39;t say anything for almost a minute. &quot;They took my cargo
and left me to die. I killed them for it. I wanted to pay him back.&quot;

    Angelica was ready to shout her own lungs out before she deflated
into a chair at the table. &quot;Yeah, I would have done the same. I wanna
just leave, but I&#39;m not goin&#39; again. I&#39;ll be there when they take us
in. If you didn&#39;t want me makin&#39; a stand for you you should have just
said, not tried to make me hate you again. I&#39;m not gonna do that. I&#39;m
over all that stuff now, and unless you say you don&#39;t want me around
any more I&#39;m gonna play the protector so you can let go.&quot;

    She smiled a little as Jei lifted her head. &quot;You gotta learn I
ain&#39;t gonna let you push me away for my own benefit. We&#39;re partners,
remember?&quot;

    &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I want you here.&quot; There was nothing left for Jei to
realise. She may not have her for long, but Angelica was there for
her, and she wasn&#39;t going to do anything to jeopardise that any more.
Perhaps it was selfish, but whatever happened she wanted Angelica
there too. There was nothing else she needed.

    Angelica nodded. &quot;That&#39;s better. Now what&#39;re we gonna do when we
get outta this mess?&quot;

    It was flippant and wishful, but it kept them occupied, and right
now that was all they needed.

***

    It was some time later when Yae awoke, a hand gently shaking her
shoulder.

    &quot;Yae, wake up,&quot; Sylvie said softly so as not to startle her
upright. &quot;They&#39;ve found us.&quot;

    &quot;Oh, hey Syl,&quot; Yae mumbled groggily, wondering why her left arm
was numb. &quot;Hey, you&#39;re wearing your glasses!&quot;

    Sylvie blinked in confusion. That seemed a rather strange thing to
say first thing in the morning. &quot;Yeees, I do usually wear glasses.&quot;

    &quot;Oh.&quot; Yae&#39;s mind quickly told her not to try and move since the
girl that had stolen her heart was still partially sleeping on her.
&quot;You just haven&#39;t worn them for a while. You know, they make you look
cute.&quot;

    Sylvie smiled modestly and with a small amount of caution, &quot;Umm,
considering your position I&#39;m not the one to be told that.&quot; She
motioned to Tataku, still fast asleep at, and virtually on, Yae&#39;s
side. &quot;We don&#39;t want her getting jealous.&quot;

    Yae nodded. &quot;But she&#39;s the one here,&quot; she said, nodding to the
bed.

    Sylvie smiled in embarrassment, a blush forming across her face,
&quot;I... I see...&quot;

    Yae had to struggle to stop from laughing. &quot;We didn&#39;t do anything.
But it was nice. Real nice.&quot; She sighed and let her head flop back
onto the pillow. &quot;What&#39;s up again? We&#39;re screwed?&quot;

    Sylvie&#39;s smiled faded. &quot;There&#39;s a police ship radioing Crow our
rights. He said he wants to take some of us into restrained custody
and the rest have to follow in the Starlight. He&#39;s coming over in a
minute.&quot;

    Yae nodded. &quot;We&#39;ll be there.&quot;

    Sylvie left as Yae began to gently extricate herself from Tataku&#39;s
sleepy form. Once she had the use of both her arms again she could see
the green haired girl stirring and gently brushed at her fringe.
&quot;Tataku-chan, it&#39;s time to wake up.&quot;

    Tataku&#39;s eyes opened radiantly and she gave a small yawn, stifled
by her hand. &quot;Good morning.&quot; She blinked a few times before snuggling
closer into Yae&#39;s side.

    &quot;Tataku-chan,&quot; Yae said, gently pulling her away, &quot;we have to get
ready. The police are here.&quot;

    On hearing that Tataku only pulled herself closer to Yae. &quot;I don&#39;t
want to go. I don&#39;t want that. It&#39;s not fair.&quot;

    Yae sighed as she enveloped her in a reassuring hug. &quot;There&#39;s
nothing we can do now. I told you, it&#39;ll be okay, remember?&quot;

    &quot;Mm hmm,&quot; Tataku nodded as they sat there for a while, taking
comfort from each other&#39;s arms.

    &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go,&quot; Tataku said as she finally released her. &quot;We
can&#39;t really put it off, can we?&quot;

    Yae shook her head and they began to dress, both faintly blushing
all the while.

***

    C-581-A stepped with unnerving severity out of the coupling gantry
and onto the Starlight, his gun in hand, ready to do what he was built
to do. All six of the now fugitives stood solemnly, waiting for his
inevitable line.

    &quot;Crow October-san, Jei Tazenten-san, you are under arrest. Do you
both understand the charges you have already been read via inter-ship
radio?&quot;

    &quot;Yes,&quot; Crow huffed, very angry at the entire ordeal.

    Jei gave the android a hooded glare. &quot;Disturbing the peace how?&quot;

    C-581-A locked his eyes onto Jei. &quot;The high profile nature of your
most recent crime has alerted the mass media and incited rioting among
several communities not in agreement with Pandora-san&#39;s
administration. You may dispute the charge at the hearing and trial,
but you are accused of deliberately instigating the disturbances using
the Chaosis space race as a means to gain mass attention. It could be
likened to a criminal publicity stunt. Has this clarified your query?&quot;

    Jei nodded. &quot;Yes, I get it.&quot; That was one charge she would be
taking issue with.

    &quot;What about the rest of us?&quot; Angelica growled, her fingers
twitching for the sword on her back.

    &quot;You will accompany us in this craft to the holding area under
section six oh two of the criminal handling bill where upon you will
officially be read any charges against you and will be either
transferred to the formal hearing or discharged pending punishment.&quot;

    &quot;No,&quot; said Angelica forcefully, &quot;I&#39;m goin&#39; with Jei.&quot;

    C-581-A narrowed his eyes, exuding a cold menace that had been
very well refined. &quot;You will remain on board racing class vessel
Tachi-01352#9, Starlight, and follow in ETS formation with police
vessel Pijisi-99661#0, PGC 00, until the holding area is reached. Do
you understand?&quot;

    &quot;Screw that!&quot; Angelica yelled, her hand flashing for the hilt
across her shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m...&quot;

    But before she could even draw the broadsword C-581-A&#39;s gun was
pointed right between her eyes, his hand not wavering in the
slightest.

    &quot;I would not attempt to draw your weapon as that would constitute
resisting arrest and I would be authorised to use extreme force in
subduing you based on your previous record.&quot; He blinked, as if to
emphasise the fact. &quot;You would not be held alongside Tazenten-san.&quot;

    Angelica just grinned. &quot;Try me.&quot;

    The instant Angelica drew the blade she parried sideways, and
C-581-A pulled the trigger.

    &quot;STOP IT!&quot; Jei screamed as she watched Angelica&#39;s head fly around,
Tataku and Sylvie cringing back while Yae and Crow went for their own
weapons. &quot;Please?&quot;

    But the outlaw didn&#39;t fall. She reached slowly up to her temple to
feel the cut ends of what had once been a lock of hair and the thin
trickle of blood seeping slowly from the scratch on her ear.

    &quot;You have had your warning shot,&quot; C-581-A said, his voice just as
calm and at it had been when he first stepped onboard. &quot;Please holster
your weapons.&quot;

    Yae and Crow did as they were told, the boyish young woman moving
to hold Tataku where she sat curled into herself looking fearfully up
at them. Sylvie straightened up and looked cautiously over towards
Angelica. The outlaw was still grinning, the massive blade still in
her hands.

    &quot;Angelica?&quot; Jei asked quietly. Her voice sounded very far off, but
she was just trying to find the words she wanted to say. &quot;Sometimes
the stars seem so far off, and you feel so alone, and there&#39;s nothing
you can do but watch them, thinking how lonely they must be too. But
their light always reaches its destination, even if it seems to take
forever. It hurts. We can&#39;t ever get it right can we? But I&#39;ll reach
you, eventually.&quot;

    Angelica looked at her sadly, the grin slipping off her face as
the hidden request came through. &quot;Not if I get to you first. Get outta
here before I change my mind and show this guy what I got.&quot;

    Jei nodded silently as she and Crow stepped into the coupling
gantry, followed by C-581-A.

    &quot;Formation specifications will be radioed to you.&quot;

    The remaining four watched sadly as the airlock door shut. Sylvie
laid a hand on Angelica&#39;s shoulder as the blond outlaw&#39;s head dropped,
a hand going to the newly cut tips where that lock of hair had been.

    &quot;Bastard.&quot;

***

    Pandora smiled slowly as she closed the door to the court&#39;s
bathroom. After a full week she had the people who had tarnished her
reputation exactly where she wanted them, and she was going to enjoy
every minute of it.

    She had the chance to ruminate as she relieved herself; how had
such a pathetic bunch managed to cause her the problems they had?
Their stunt had had effects that the six of them would never have
considered in a million years. And of course the resistance back on
Olto was as strong as ever now, the racing crew being hailed as heroes
while the mobs tried to sack the official buildings in every major
city on the planet. It wasn&#39;t anything she couldn&#39;t deal with in the
long run, but it was a nuisance she could well have done without.

    It was a shame that only two of the six were taking any major
grief in the matter, their surprisingly competent lawyer getting the
rest off with fines and community service. October and Tazenten
though, they were the big prize, and they were going down for it as
far as she could push them.

    It was pretty obvious that October wasn&#39;t going to get a real
sentence, but he would never work as a bounty hunter again. Even when
he could get his licence back his new reputation and profile would
make sure he was out of that game. Pandora knew there was little else
he had.

    And who would have thought Tazenten would have turned out to be
such a powder keg? The now cornered cargo hauler showed nothing
underneath those clouded, impassive eyes, but Pandora could tell. The
woman was well and truly broken. She was just waiting to see her break
into tears right there in the accused box.

    None of it was really necessary, but she wasn&#39;t going to let them
off. She had a reputation to keep, and a warning to send.

    She flushed the toilet and stepped out of the cubicles towards the
sink, not noticing the cubicle beside hers slowly opening.

    &quot;Hello &#39;Pandora&#39;,&quot; the regal voice said as she felt a hand gently
rest on the minute bulge at the base of her neck. &quot;I can&#39;t believe
even you would do this to them. You&#39;ve gone too far.&quot;

    Pandora&#39;s smiled widened just a little as she looked into the
mirror to see the red headed woman who stared emotionally back.
&quot;Circe. I&#39;m so glad you could make it for the trial. They are quite a
pair, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

    &quot;I should do it,&quot; Circe almost rasped, her beautiful voice
cracking. &quot;I should tear this wretched thing out and kill &#39;Pandora&#39;
right now. I want my cousin back.&quot;

    &quot;But you won&#39;t,&quot; Pandora said, as though she were thoroughly bored
by the routine. &quot;You won&#39;t kill me, just as I won&#39;t cut you down where
you stand. To think my own relative would see me as such a monster. I
am your only cousin no matter what you may think and somewhere in that
overly dramatic head of yours you know that. I will keep Olto
prosperous and well governed, and you will keep leading that
resistance movement of yours, just as we have done ever since we found
one another again. Remove that little plug back there and you kill me,
and God only knows what would happen to your precious cousin then.
Pamela is long since gone Circe. Pandora is what she became, but she
still loves you like a sister.&quot;

    Circe took a breath but Pandora didn&#39;t even wait for the
impassioned speech to affect whatever compassion the electro-nerve
plug in her neck might have left intact. She had heard it all before.

    Circe&#39;s words died in her throat as Pandora left, and the regret
and loss began to well up again, just as it did every time they met
now. She turned to the sink and slammed her palm into the polished
white marble, her eyes shut tight to rein in her feelings, wishing she
had the strength to do what she knew in her heart she had to do.

    &quot;One day Pamela. I swear... One day.&quot;

***

    Jei didn&#39;t even register Pandora&#39;s presence as the woman arrived
back in the courtroom along with all the others who had taken the
opportunity to have a short break while her fate was sealed.

    Three days. Was that long for a trial? Somehow she didn&#39;t think
so, but what did she know about law? The law was something you obeyed
or paid the price for, that was all most people needed to know. Three
days of recounting her unpleasant hidden past, picking her apart piece
by piece to see what made her tick. What little she had to say in
defence didn&#39;t make much difference, both she and her assigned lawyer
knew that.

    The humiliation of pleading guilty for a reduced sentence under
mental instability was the worst five seconds of her entire life. She
had admitted they were right all along. Her parents and classmates, or
rather the people she had studied with, and the closed minded
professional hypocrites back &#39;home&#39;. She had no choice but to admit
that they were right. She was officially a &#39;troubled individual&#39;. Why
didn&#39;t they just call her a basket case and get on with it? She felt
it would have been better to hear that than suffer the veiled pity and
disgust they stared at her with.

    It all seemed to be going too fast. One minute everything was
fine, the next she was being locked up for multiple murder. &lt;But then,
it had never really been fine,&gt; she thought sourly to herself, and
received the reply that would always be there.

    &lt;Yes, just one big mistake. Too late for that though, now you just
take it as it comes.&gt;

    She hadn&#39;t seen the others since the trial began. It seemed
strange how much she craved their company now. She wanted nothing more
that to curl up in Angelica&#39;s arms and cry herself out. The outlaw
seemed to have that effect on her when they could finally be together.
It was pitiful, but so wonderful at the same time.

    The black cloud fell further over her. Most likely she would never
see Angelica again. She could wish and hope and dream as much as she
liked, but could she really believe that Angelica would be there when
she was finally let out? Who would wait for so many years for someone
they so rarely got along with? So much would have changed by then and
Jei knew she would remain the same, just that bit more tired.

    Any further thoughts were halted as the adjudicators filed back in
and took their seats, then pressed the panels that gave their votes.

    It was a foregone conclusion. Guilty on eight of the nine charges.
She&#39;d managed to get off on the incitement to riot charge after all,
not that it gave much satisfaction.

    She closed her eyes as the judge read out the sentence. Five years
in prison followed by two more in a correctional institute. It could
have been worse. A lot worse. But that didn&#39;t make her feel any better
either. Seven years. She didn&#39;t know if she could hold out that long.
Then again, did she really want to?

    She hardly paid any attention as the armed guards gently lead her
out of the court, her hands cuffed behind her and Pandora&#39;s satisfied
smile following her every step.

    Jei hardly noticed the journey to the shuttle pad where the prison
ship was waiting. As far as timing the transport was concerned it
couldn&#39;t have been better. It was a scheduled run straight after the
trial and there was no time for spectators to get there. Getting to
the court had been a rat run of cheers and jeering she was very glad
not to see here.

    Only the single piercing whistle made her turn as she stepped onto
the docking gantry. There, behind the chain link fence stood a small
group. A tall shy girl with green hair waved sadly, as did the short
blond girl, the boyish figure beside them giving her victory V. The
thin man behind them all gave her a brief two fingered wave, and at
the far left stood another blond in impeccable ivory clothing, yelling
something as she waved.

    Jei&#39;s heart soared. It didn&#39;t matter that she couldn&#39;t quite hear
what Angelica was saying. They&#39;d come to see her, and she knew what
the outlaw meant.

    The nudge to her back reminded her of what she was doing and a
smile spread across her face as she continued up the gantry, nodding
to them all as she went.

    She would make it through this if it were the last thing she did.
Because she would believe that Angelica would be there when she got
out, whatever happened from here on. And for once the voice inside her
smiled as well, thinking maybe she was right this time.

***

    It was well past sundown when Sylvie and Crow arrived at the newly
released Maria&#39;s Summer. Crow still had his pride, but walking through
Matsues alone after dark was a very bad idea, especially since he had
lost his weapons licence as well as his Bounty Hunter&#39;s one. A real
twist of irony that the city most eager to host legal battles was also
one of the least safe at night. Or perhaps it was just good sense.

    &quot;So what are you going to do now if you don&#39;t want to join us?&quot;
Sylvie asked as they waited for the docking crews to deal with the
paperwork.

    Crow shrugged. &quot;Don&#39;t know. As soon as my three years are up I&#39;ll
try and get my licence back. Who knows, after that I might try and
take Pandora on again! Until then I can work on research, make some
more connections, whatever.&quot; He reached into his pocket and took out a
small folded slip of paper.

    &quot;Right now this is my best bet. Gladiatrix said she could do with
someone like me, and after seeing her in action I was impressed.
Depending what she&#39;s after I might just take her up on it.&quot;

    Sylvie nodded. &quot;I suppose I missed that, but it&#39;s good you have
some idea of what you want to do. And our offer will stay open if you
want.&quot;

    Crow grinned lopsidedly, &quot;Thanks, but that&#39;s not my kind of work.
And Angelica would probably try and set me up with Andy again.&quot;

    &quot;...&quot; Sylvie stared at him in stupefaction. That last sentence
made no sense to her whatsoever. &quot;... What?&quot;

    &quot;While you three were being interviewed I managed to bump into
Angelica before my trial started. Somehow we found ourselves talking
about how it would all turn out, and she said you and I should pair
up, then we&#39;d have a full set. When I told her you weren&#39;t really my
type she suggested Andy instead.&quot;

    Sylvie just goggled at him and hugged her panda closer to her.

    Crow nodded with a wry smile. &quot;Yeah, exactly.&quot; He didn&#39;t think
much of the joke either.

    He leant back against one of the loading dollies. &quot;Just out of
curiosity, there&#39;s something I haven&#39;t quite figured out yet. How
*did* you survive a pistol slug to the chest?&quot;

    Sylvie sighed and sat down on one of the nearby boxes. &quot;Yae asked
the same thing this morning. I guess I can practice telling her with
you, can&#39;t I?&quot;

    Crow nodded then turned as one of the docking crew yelled his
clearance number to him. &quot;Sure, you can fill me in en route,&quot; he said.

    Sylvie began as they boarded Crow&#39;s ship and by the time he
dropped her off where the Gal&#39;s Army had been put she had it pretty
much figured out in her head. All she had to do was say it to Yae.

***

    &quot;When I was little, before my parents split up, my Dad and I were
really close, but he was always working, so we&#39;d talk while he did
whatever he was doing at the time. After a while he started asking me
to help him. I liked the fact that he wanted me to help, even though I
didn&#39;t know what it was I was really doing.&quot;

    Sylvie paused in her tale, looking up at Yae and Tataku, both
listening avidly on the sofa aboard the Gal&#39;s Army.

    &quot;After one of the experiments that he was really enthusiastic
about I started hearing his voice in my head. It turned out that he&#39;d
used me as the test subject in a genetics experiment to help let the
human mind make the most of its unused potential, and I ended up being
able to hear what he was feeling. Sometimes I&#39;d even hear his
thoughts, and after he did the same thing to himself we would talk to
each other like that. Just in our heads.&quot;

    At the pair&#39;s mixed expressions Sylvie smiled sadly. &quot;Maybe he
shouldn&#39;t have done it, but I really liked being able to do that. Mum
on the other hand, she was furious when she found out. Mattiaz had
seen him do it to me, and he told her. That&#39;s why they got divorced.&quot;

    &quot;Jeez,&quot; Yae said, a little anger in her voice, &quot;your own brother
ratted him out.&quot;

    Sylvie nodded. &quot;Even after my Dad left though I was still able to
talk to him sometimes. Then he just stopped talking, and I couldn&#39;t
feel him any more. Then Andy arrived. He had a note in his paws from
him, saying sorry, and that he loved me. That was his goodbye note.&quot;

    Tataku looked at her with compassion as Yae closed her eyes.

    &quot;No wonder you got so depressed when that panda turned up. I
didn&#39;t know,&quot; Yae said, remembering their early time as roommates at
the Academy. &quot;But how did this stop you getting shot? Did you read the
guard&#39;s mind or something?&quot;

    Sylvie shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t hear everybody. Almost no-one in
fact. It only works with people I&#39;m really close to, and most of the
time I just feel their emotions, not what they&#39;re thinking. It&#39;s only
properly worked with three people. My Dad... and you two.&quot;

    The pair sat surprised as she continued. Tataku wondered what she
had done to receive such high praise, even in such a round about way,
but the mere idea was enough to strike Yae dumb.

    &quot;I felt your fear,&quot; Sylvie told Tataku, &quot;and an impression of
loss, violence and an entry place. The guard was in the doorway.
Remember that lesson at the Academy on how to take a hit to minimise
damage Yae?&quot;

    Yae nodded, her eyes still wide.

    &quot;I just used that. If I hadn&#39;t known it was coming beforehand I
wouldn&#39;t have had time to move. You can&#39;t dodge bullets. But thanks to
Tataku I knew where he was, meaning I knew which way to move so the
bullet would glance off my shirt and ribcage instead of punching
through. Ballistic slugs are bad like that, no penetration power, but
it was still mostly good fortune.

    Yae nodded slowly, taking it all in. Their combat shirts were
hardly body armour, but they were a damn sight better than regular
cloth. For her part Tataku smiled radiantly. &quot;I... I don&#39;t really
understand how that works with the bullet, but I&#39;m really glad it did
Sylvie.&quot;

    Yae on the other hand had other concerns on her mind. &quot;So... how
long have you been able to read my mind?&quot; she asked in a very
depressed voice.

    Sylvie cringed a little. &quot;I don&#39;t read it, it&#39;s more like I can
just hear it. But, well, since about half way through year one at the
Academy.&quot;

    Yae couldn&#39;t believe it. For over a decade Sylvie had been hearing
all the things she had thought about her. Yae was ready to
disintegrate out of pure guilt, embarrassment exploding through her.
&quot;Oh God Syl I&#39;m so sorry. I...&quot;

    Sylvie didn&#39;t let her finish. She knew what sort of thing the
pilot was going to say after all. &quot;Yae, it&#39;s okay. Actually I was kind
of flattered, even if it was a little... personal sometimes. I should
be the one apologising for not telling you. For knowing what you were
feeling all this time. Actually if it&#39;s strong I can feel it too.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m usually happy or depressed whenever you are.&quot;

    Yae scratched the back of her head and gave a sheepish smile, her
face burning. &quot;Well, thanks for not being mad.&quot;

    Sylvie smiled back. &quot;Well, we&#39;d better be going now. I&#39;ll start up
the engines and file for takeoff clearance.&quot;

    Yae nodded as Sylvie rose, leaving for the cockpit.

    &quot;I wish I didn&#39;t have to go back to university yet,&quot; Tataku said
quietly, slipping down on the sofa and resting her head on Yae&#39;s
shoulder. &quot;I only have a few more days before I have to head back.&quot;

    Yae wrapped a comforting arm around her. &quot;And we have just over a
week of journey there once that happens. A week I intend to make the
most of while I still have you here.&quot;

    Tataku nodded. &quot;I feel a bit guilty though. My pay from the job I
did for the university will pay most of my fine, and I have my share
of the winnings from the Chaosis too, but you two and Angelica have
community service as well. Crow lost his licence, and Jei&#39;s in jail. I
feel like I&#39;m being let off lightly.&quot;

    Yae chuckled a little. &quot;It&#39;s your good karma working for you. Me
and Syl will be fine. A year of work doing sort of what we do anyway&#39;s
okay, and we&#39;ll get our hazardous materials licence back after that.
Crow&#39;s got something lined up I&#39;ll bet, and Angelica&#39;s got the
Starlight now. She said she&#39;s started looking for crew already, and
that&#39;s keeping her occupied. The race money will pay off our fines and
then some. Jei, well, she&#39;ll get through it okay. I think she&#39;s gonna
survive doing time better than most people would. It won&#39;t wear her
down the way it would with me at least.&quot;

    The pair sat there in silence for a bit before Yae lay down on her
back, Tataku following so they both ended up staring at the ceiling,
the student&#39;s head resting on the soldier&#39;s chest. Yae wrapped her
hands over her so that they rested on her stomach, Tataku&#39;s hands
folding over them.

    After a while Yae spoke up. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to move again.&quot;

    &quot;Why?&quot;

    &quot;I can&#39;t kiss you like this.&quot;

***

    Just over a week later Tataku and Yae stepped of the Gal&#39;s Army to
be met by Tataku&#39;s main lecturer.

    &quot;I guess this is goodbye for now,&quot; Tataku said softly, her eyes
meeting Yae&#39;s.

    &quot;Yeah,&quot; Yae agreed. &quot;I&#39;ll come visit when I can, and you&#39;ve got
our frequency code if you can get to a radio relay transmitter.&quot;

    Tataku could feel her eyes beginning to water as they stood there.
&quot;I miss you already,&quot; she sniffed.

    Yae took her hands gently. &quot;Me too.&quot; She leant over and the pair
lost themselves in one last lingering kiss before they were parted.

    When the kiss was broken they stood holding each other before Yae
spoke up. &quot;If I don&#39;t go now you&#39;ll never get rid of me.&quot;

    &quot;I don&#39;t want to be rid of you. But you have go.&quot; She darted in
and gave her a quick peck on the lips before they let each other go.
&quot;Until next time.&quot;

    &quot;Yeah. See ya&#39; Kookoo-chan.&quot;

    The pair parted and went their separate ways, each giving a last
glance and wave to the other as they went.

    At the other side of the docking platform Misaniti-sensei smiled
as he met his student. &quot;I see more has happened than even the media
has told us Tataku. Congratulations.&quot;

    Tataku blushed furiously and began to study her sandals intently.
&quot;Umm... thank you sir.&quot;

    &quot;I hope you&#39;re ready for a few small surprises,&quot; he said as he led
her off. &quot;You&#39;ve become something of a celebrity around here.&quot;

***

    Josie Kitt, the newest member of the slowly growing crew, stepped
hesitantly into the cockpit of the Starlight and looked around. She
was barely fourteen years old, but she knew everything and anything
there was to know about computer software. Be it AI, relay programs or
hacking protocols, she could read and write it expertly. It was all
she&#39;d done for eight years, and she was now diligently teaching
herself computer hardware and electronics. She was also looking for
the woman who&#39;d been willing to hire her straight out of the young
offenders&#39; institute.

    &quot;Umm... excuse me,&quot; she asked the man at the ship scanners,
&quot;where&#39;s the captain?&quot;

    The man turned and quirked an eyebrow. &quot;You mean Angelica? She&#39;s
in front of the vid screen again. Lounge.&quot;

    &quot;Thanks.&quot;

    Josie sighed. She hadn&#39;t known the Lady Angelica for more than
three days, but this was not good news. Lady Angelica was very
emotionally changeable, and right now she would be depressed, and
ready to take it out on someone. The cook had already gotten a minor
beating thanks to his complete lack of tact.

    Josie was right. Angelica was watching the news again, Tangalo
asleep beside her. The story would be dead in a few more days, but
reports and items into the &#39;Starlight Killer&#39; should have been dropped
ages ago. As far as she was concerned it just wasn&#39;t fair. And giving
the woman a label like that because of a heartfelt speech was cruel,
and the ship&#39;s name only made it stick harder.

    &quot;Umm... Lady Angelica? I&#39;ve finished re-working the ship AI so you
can make the upgrades you wanted.&quot;

    Angelica roughly shut off the vid screen and tossed the remote
onto the sofa as she got up. &quot;Good! Now we can get goin&#39; on this
baby!&quot; she said enthusiastically.

    &quot;Lady Angelica... are you okay?&quot;

    Angelica let some of the false jollity drop and gave her a wry
grin. &quot;Jose, I feel like shit, and I ain&#39;t gonna talk about it. But
thanks for askin&#39;. I knew you were a good find.&quot; She marched out into
the hallway, Josie following close behind. &quot;And you&#39;re crew so it&#39;s
just Angelica. If crew can&#39;t be friends then they might as well not be
on the same ship, alright?&quot;

    &quot;Okay Angelica-sama,&quot; Josie said, glad that she was in good
spirits despite whatever was going on inside her head.

    Angelica stopped and turned to give her a deadpan stare, but she
wasn&#39;t going to argue now, not with Josie. &quot;It&#39;ll do for now. Come
on.&quot;

    On entering the cockpit Josie took her temporary position at the
communications post while Angelica took the navigator&#39;s seat.

    &quot;Where are we headed?&quot; Josie asked.

    &quot;The long haul to the Sol system. Earth and Mars may be burnt out
but they&#39;ve got the best ship modders in the galaxy out by Neptune.&quot;

    After collecting her and Jei&#39;s share of the prize money from the
race she had paid off her fine and would have enough to make almost
half the ship modifications she wanted to in one go.

    &quot;What about your community service?&quot; asked the man at the
scanners.

    &quot;That&#39;s the great bit!&quot; Angelica enthused. &quot;We&#39;re taking relief
supplies to Mars for the whole two years of it!&quot;

    A little typing into the AI later and they were on their way.
Angelica felt far more tranquil as she sat at her station, going
through all the things she would be able to do while she was still
under obligation to this relief supply run.

    She looked back to the middle of the room. She could visualise
what she wanted done to the cockpit. Turn it into a proper bridge, not
just a functioning race control and piloting room. It would cost a
ridiculous amount to have it re-fitted while still keeping the superb
control systems intact at the end of it, but it would definitely be
worth it.

    It seemed a little odd to her how high up on her list of
priorities a captain&#39;s chair was. It would be seven years before it
was used.

    &lt;Seven years,&gt; she thought. &lt;That&#39;s not so long really.&gt; She
couldn&#39;t quite convince herself, but it did help a little all the
same. &lt;Bullshit, that&#39;s a damn age, but who cares?! If you can take
it, I can take it! You ain&#39;t gonna break me that easy.&gt; She cracked a
small smile. It was amazing how little sense life could make
sometimes.

    And with that she sat back in her chair and watched the stars,
beginning the long wait for her woman to come home.
