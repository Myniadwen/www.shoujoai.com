<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>      &quot;Take it off.&quot; Eveon pouted at Mina&#39;s request. &quot;Come on... take it off...!&quot; She just 
shook her head as her girlfriend asked again. &quot;No way Mina! You&#39;re already winning so how 
about we stop?&quot;

      Mina just giggled and reached towards her. &quot;You wanted to play, Eveon. Now... take it 
off or I will.&quot; Eveon gulped. Mina had already secured 5 pieces and now...

      The blonde girl grimaced as Mina reached across and snatched her rook off of the 
board. Eveon fell backwards, exasperated. &quot;I give up! You&#39;ve already got over half my 
pieces! What more do you want?!&quot;

      Mina just crawled around the chess board and laid down next to her, arms around her 
waist. &quot;Well, if you want to give up now, we can play poker.&quot;

      Eveon smiled and leaned down to kiss Mina on the lips. Eveon was always shy with her 
kisses, but Mina didn&#39;t mind. In fact, it was one of the things she loved about her. As she 
deepened the kiss, Eveon got a little more aggressive and soon Mina was happily making out 
with her girlfriend.

      &quot;Sh... shouldn&#39;t we,&quot; Eveon said between sweet kisses, &quot;...be looking for... 
everyone?&quot; Mina just silenced her with a well placed kiss.

      &quot;Nah... they should be fine... right now,&quot; Mina let her tongue drift into Eveon&#39;s 
mouth as they kissed for the umpteenth time. &quot;...let&#39;s make that poker game... a little more 
interesting.&quot;

      As they started the first hand, Eveon was disappointed to see she only had a pair of 
eights. Mina was smiling contently. They traded in their cards and Eveon smiled wickedly. 
She had 3 eights and 2 nines! No way could she lose... &quot;Full house!&quot; Eveon said putting down 
the cards. Mina just smiled contentedly and showed her hand.

      &quot;Four of a kind sixes.&quot; Eveon just pouted and sighed. &quot;Alright, next game.&quot; As she 
reached over to grab the deck of cards, Mina pushed her away. &quot;I forgot to mention... we&#39;re 
playing strip poker!&quot;

      Eveon just paled and Mina smiled. &quot;N-no way! You didn&#39;t say that earlier. I don&#39;t 
agree to these rules!!!&quot; The black haired girl grabbed the deck and started to shuffle. 
&quot;Take off... how about your socks? I&#39;ll be nice.&quot;

      Eveon took them off and glared at her. &quot;You&#39;re bipolar Mina... one minute, you&#39;re 
maternal and sweet... the next a total pervert.&quot; Mina&#39;s disarming smile as she dealt the 
cards made Eveon&#39;s heart melt.

      Even if her girlfriend was trying to get her naked... Eveon traded in three of her 
cards and smiled wickedly. She had a straight... She peered over at her cards to see Mina 
looking at hers with nervously. Good... Eveon could see some of that beautiful porcelain 
skin hidden beneath her tank top.

      &quot;Straight!&quot; Eveon shouted, putting down the cards and triumphantly said, &quot;I want you 
to take off your shirt.&quot; Mina just gave her a confused glance. &quot;...but...&quot; Mina showed her 
cards. &quot;A flush beats a straight every time.&quot;

      Eveon just stared. &quot;Th-that&#39;s... not fair!&quot; Mina just gave her a flirtatious smile. 
&quot;Off. The shirt.&quot; The blonde girl backed away. &quot;No! I refuse to play this any longer!&quot;

      Mina started to reach across the table. &quot;Take it off. Now.&quot; Mina&#39;s stern tone 
surprised Eveon, but she was suddenly disarmed by her next statement. &quot;...please? Or do you 
want me to do it?&quot;

      Eveon gulped and decided that she wouldn&#39;t be able to stand Mina taking it off for 
her. She mussed up her ponytail as she pulled her t-shirt over her head and threw it at 
Mina. She caught it with much ease and stared at Eveon&#39;s exposed chest.

      &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful...&quot; Eveon blushed and Mina started shuffling the cards. It wasn&#39;t 
fair... it wasn&#39;t fair that Mina could see her bra covered chest and Eveon couldn&#39;t see a 
thing. As Eveon looked at her cards, she made up her mind.

      There was no way that she could lose this game without seeing something.

      &quot;...and what&#39;s your favorite food?&quot; For the last hour Isaka had been grilling her. 
Like, seriously, grilling her. Krystal had expected Isaka to just take advantage of her, but 
the demon was actually asking all these questions. &quot;...um, depends... ice cream usually... 
sometimes hot wings and other times I get in the mood for mashed potatoes.&quot;

      &quot;Really? I&#39;m pretty sure that after a little while, you&#39;re going to be my favorite 
food.&quot; Krystal tried to move away from the demon, but she couldn&#39;t. Alas, Isaka was sprawled 
on top of her, lazily stroking her tummy with one hand.

      &quot;...Isaka, how come you aren&#39;t... well, how come you actually are trying to get to 
know me? You seem like all you want to do is...&quot; Krystal gulped. &quot;...you know... you just 
want to do &#39;that&#39; with me.&quot;

      Isaka had to stifle a laugh at Krystal. The woman couldn&#39;t even say &#39;sex&#39;. &quot;It&#39;s quite 
simple. I&#39;m not just here for one lap, I&#39;m in it for the whole race.&quot;

      After making her analogy, Isaka tenderly cupped Krystal&#39;s face. &quot;I don&#39;t just want 
your body. I want you. Pure and simple.&quot;

      Krystal flushed a bright red as Isaka leaned in and...

      Planted a chaste kiss on her cheek. The blonde woman just stared at the demon in 
surprise. &quot;What? Is it surprising that I don&#39;t want to move too fast and scare you away...? 
Or do you want me to kiss you on the lips?&quot;

      Krystal just pushed the demon away. &quot;I&#39;m fine, thank you!&quot; Isaka just laughed and sat 
up, giving Krystal enough room to do the same. The demon just smiled at her and a strangely 
comfortable silence pervaded the room.

      &quot;...Isaka?&quot; The demon just nodded, her lavender eyes trained on Krystal&#39;s face. &quot;How 
did you become a demon?&quot; As an exorcist, Krystal could tell which demons were born naturally 
and which were... well, which ones used to be human.

      She chuckled and presumptuously laid her head in lap. &quot;How perceptive of you... It&#39;s 
quite a simple story.&quot; Isaka trained her lavender eyes on Krystal&#39;s own blue ones.

      &quot;A long time ago, my parents had died and I was taken in by an older girl. She was 
like my big sister and we did everything together,&quot; The demon flicked Krystal&#39;s nose 
playfully, &quot;She was kind and maternal like you.&quot;

      Krystal blushed, but Isaka only continued. &quot;As I got older, I began to adore her 
more... not as a sister figure. Eventually, it came to a boil and I tried to make my move.&quot;

      Isaka face turned solemn. &quot;I lived in a time where such things were seen as satanic 
and evil. She didn&#39;t understand... no one did. Instead, I was shunned and beaten, sent out 
to be on my own.&quot;

      &quot;...I&#39;m sorry, Isaka. If only people were a little more open minded, huh?&quot; The demon 
gave her a slight smile. &quot;That&#39;s sweet of you... but one day, I was lost in the forest. As I 
lied there, crying, I was confronted by a disembodied dark spirit.&quot;

      Isaka let out a sigh and ran a hand over Krystal&#39;s cheek as she sat up. &quot;In exchange 
for revenge, I allowed the spirit to enter my body and become one with me.&quot; She grinned 
wickedly and tapped Krystal on the forehead. &quot;We fused together, but my conscious stayed 
intact. At first, I indulged in every female that I found attractive, but then... I realized 
that there were people like Mina and Eveon who need a nudge in the right direction.&quot;

      Krystal was lost in thought. At least Isaka hadn&#39;t killed people... or had she? She 
didn&#39;t want to know... So lost in her thoughts, Krystal didn&#39;t notice Isaka&#39;s mouth nibbling 
at her neck until her tongue flicked out.

      &quot;Gah! Isaka!&quot; The demon grinned sheepishly as Krystal reprimanded her. &quot;I only do it 
because I care.&quot; Krystal just rubbed her neck reproachfully, wondering how her boyfriend was 
doing... 

***** 

      Seth was really uncomfortable. He could deal with his girlfriend getting seduced by a 
lesbian, them getting attacked by an angel-demon hybrid, and even with staying in the same 
room for a long time, but...

      If only Tycara would stop looking at him like that! She was like a school girl with a 
crush... He glanced at her from the corner of his eyes and she just looked away, as though 
she hadn&#39;t been looking at him for the last minute or so.

      &quot;Tycara... why do you keep looking at me?&quot; She blushed at being caught and just 
twirled some of her white hair with her finger. &quot;Ah... um, you&#39;re just really handsome and 
smart and sweet and funny, hahahaha!&quot;

      Seth scooted a little further away from her. &quot;No offense, but shouldn&#39;t you be a 
lesbian too? I mean, Mina is, Eveon is, Isaka is and at this rate... it seems like Krystal 
is too...&quot; He let out a forlorn sigh at the thought. He was sure that his girlfriend was 
already engaged in a dirty sex fest...

      He tried really hard to drool at the thought.

      &quot;I&#39;m not... just because Isaka took care of me doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t like men. 
She&#39;s like my big sister, even if she did try to push me on that side of the fence, it never 
worked.&quot; Tycara looked at him dreamily. &quot;It&#39;s because of guys like you that I&#39;m straight!&quot;

      Seth just massaged his temples. Was... was Krystal already in the arms of Isaka? Was 
she being seduced right at this moment?

      Tycara gave him a worried glance. Seth&#39;s face had gone red and his eyes glazed over as 
though he was in a daydream. Perhaps it was better that Tycara was so innocent and couldn&#39;t 
guess what he was thinking about.
