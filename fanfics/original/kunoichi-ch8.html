~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Inside the National Diet Building

A puff of smoke rose up from nowhere. Leaving behind the flame 
kunoichi, Shiki. The young woman looked downwards in her 
crouching position as the smoke began to fade. But she noted 
that something was wrong. The air around her felt... cold. Very 
chilled. And Shiki was beginning to realize why. The floor 
beneath her... was frozen. In a thick sheet of ice. So thick and 
well formed that she couldn&#39;t hardly make out the floorboards 
beneath it. Then Shiki stood up and looked around. Ice covered 
the whole room. Over the walls, the floors. Even the ceiling had 
stalactite-like ice hanging downwards. That was odd. Why would 
such thick and spacious ice be piled up in a parliamentary 
building? Then even more important factors came to mind. Namely 
the fact that this room had no doors. And if it had no doors 
then that meant there would be no way for that guard she swapped 
with to have gotten in here. This was a trap. Either that, or...

&quot;...Someone was expecting me...&quot; 

A second voice sounded out. &quot;You are right.&quot;

Shiki stood upright and gripped the hilt of her sword, Miyuki, 
behind her back. She could not sense which direction the voice 
was coming from. She looked around from one side of the iced 
room to the other. Then a puff of air boomed in the echoing and 
sparkling ice room. The bright green eyes of Shiki looked over 
to the centre of the noise. Towards the other side of the ice 
room. A large and spiky pillar of ice shot up from the frozen 
water beneath it. Within that pillar of ice was an obscured 
figure. Seconds later; the ice began to crack. Bit by bit. Each 
of the cracks slithered speedily down the pillar like snakes 
until the entire pillar shattered in one brilliant burst. Shiki 
remained focused on the image inside. A shinobi. 

A young man obviously, dressed in ninja clothing that was a 
smooth cross of white and navy blue. On the back of his waist 
was a short sword. In a similar arrangement to Shiki&#39;s sheathed 
blade. On his legs were four small rectangular pouches. Two on 
the outward side of either leg. Each one containing at least 
four kunai knives. And Shiki could tell this because of the ring 
butts that stuck out from each pouch. He was another of the 
Elemental-type shinobi. Obviously affiliated with ice (in the 
same way that Shiki was affiliated with flame and Zanmaru was 
with lightning). But the most glaring thing about him had to 
be... his face. Shiki couldn&#39;t see it. Because this man&#39;s face 
was blocked from view by a Kabuki Cat Mask. His long blonde hair 
flowed easily from the back of his head; but that was the only 
part of his head that Shiki could identify. 

The ice ninja made that trademarked two-fingered sign, 
chuckling. &quot;I thought so. I knew that you would attempt to get 
inside the Diet Building via your teleportation technique. It 
was the same ability you used to defeat Zanmaru-san. Thankfully 
I anticipated this beforehand. And the Ninjutsu spell I cast 
upon the Diet Building, Fusagu Shun-Ugoki (Blocking Instant 
Movement) re-routed your path of advance and brought you here to 
me. Now I can settle the debts of both Zanmaru-san and 
Ryoko-san.&quot;

Shiki smirked at this new foe. &quot;So. I was right. You are a 
member of the Six Orochi. Care to give me a name?&quot;  

&quot;It is more polite to give your own name first,&quot; The Ice Ninja 
quipped. 

&quot;Fine. You can me... Shiki,&quot; The Flame Kunoichi replied, &quot;And 
now for you...&quot;

The young man lowered his free hand, while maintaining the 
two-finger sign. &quot;For now I think I&#39;ll keep my real name a 
secret. Zanmaru-san and Ryoko-san were foolish enough to reveal 
themselves to you by identity. I am not like them. So can you 
call me... Cat Mask.&quot;

Not much of a name but Shiki didn&#39;t expect much from the Orochi 
anyway. &quot;Great. Well now. I suppose that you&#39;ve been planning 
for my attack. And I also suppose that you were the one who 
killed Sakamoto-san. The sheets of ice reveal as much.&quot;

Cat Mask remained silent for a second, then retorted. &quot;...I was 
only following orders. Like I am now. You are a great opponent. 
To defeat both Zanmaru-san and Ryoko-san is impressive. And I 
will test those skills. So prepare yourself, Shiki-san.&quot;

Now Shiki was beginning to understand all of this. The killing 
of Sakamoto Gendo was done for more than one reason. Partly to 
send a warning to the other Daigishi opposed to Koga rule. And 
partly to draw out Shiki by send out a call or a clue. The 
murder of Sakamoto was part of an elaborate trap. Killing two 
birds with one stone. Not a bad plan. Now Shiki had to contend 
with this Cat Masked Orochi before she could move on to speak 
with Fujiwara. Which might be tough now. Especially since 
Hirotsugu and his cohorts had been expecting her to turn up. But 
for now she just had to concentrate on the fight. Cat Mask 
snorted from behind his mask as Shiki tightened her grip over 
her short sword. Then the broken ice around his feet started to 
rise up. It all came upwards into the air, thick shard by thick 
shard, until it was all of it was suspended around his trained 
body. The ice zoomed inwards at him and began reforming. It all 
merged into another giant spike of frost; freezing him in place. 
A cloud of chilly air was wafting around it. The ice spike then 
began lowering back into the icy ground from which it had come. 
Taking Cat Mask with him. 

Shiki&#39;s emerald eyes blinked. She was more than confused. She 
had never seen this kind of Ninjutsu before. Elemental or not. 
He was using the entire icy environment to his advantage. But 
there was one thing she was aware of. The ice. It was all a 
shinobi conjuration. That Cat Mask must have used a skill called 
Kogoeta Kankyou (Frozen Surroundings) to freeze the whole room 
for this battle.  Shiki scowled and turned around. Cat Mask had 
somehow hidden himself in the ice. He could probably attack from 
more than one direction. First things first. If she could locate 
him by voice...

&quot;You&#39;re using Kogoeta Kankyou!&quot; Shiki yelled, looking around 
her, &quot;And have somehow hidden yourself in the ice! Powerful 
skill as that is; it&#39;s virtually the same as Ryoko-san&#39;s Meiro 
Kiri ability! And that didn&#39;t get her very far...&quot;

&quot;Wrong!&quot; Though Cat Mask yelled out, Shiki couldn&#39;t tell which 
way the voice was coming from. Just like before. It seemed to be 
coming from all directions, &quot;Ryoko-san hid herself within the 
fog of her technique. But I have not just hidden myself in the 
ice... I am part of it. It is high time I showed you just how 
intricate the power of ice can be...&quot;

Shiki wasn&#39;t intimidated by such talk. Words were just that. 
Words. All that mattered was action. The flame shinobi loosened 
her grip on her blade and continued to look around. He had to 
pop up some place. From there he would attack. Shiki looked over 
to her right. At the sheets of ice resting close to the ceiling 
on the far wall. The image of Cat Mask appeared on it. Like a 
reflection. But that reflection was not shown on any other piece 
of ice around that particular one. That had to be the sheet of 
ice that Cat Mask was hiding behind. Shiki fully released the 
hilt of her sword and went for one of the pouches at her waist. 
She pulled out a shuriken and quickly hurled it at the image of 
Cat Mask above. The shuriken whizzed upwards at the ice sheet. 
But before it hit; that sheet of frost warped itself into a 
different form. It became watery and liquid-like. However it 
stayed in place as a whole. Almost like a mirror. The shuriken 
went right through the water-mirror that had appeared. Like 
Shiki had thrown a stick into a lake but with no splash. But 
that wasn&#39;t the end of it. Though Shiki couldn&#39;t see it, some of 
the ice on the wall behind her did the exact same thing. Warp 
itself into a more fluid form. And from that water pane came 
Shiki&#39;s shuriken. It burst through it rapidly with the same 
speed as before. Then sliced straight through the shoulder 
fabric of Shiki&#39;s clothing. The girl gasped and looked back 
behind her. Only to see that ice return to its normal, purely 
solid form. 

Shiki blinked from astonishment. That was her shuriken. She 
could tell from the smooth and straight edges. Yet it been 
through the ice of the right wall; and then reappeared and 
slashed her through the ice of left wall. 

An amused laugh, which was obviously Cat Mask&#39;s, echoed in that 
frosty room. &quot;That was not an intelligent move, Shiki-san. You 
have just experienced a sub-skill of Kogoeta Kankyou...&quot;

Shiki gripped her attacked shoulder, which was now bleeding. 
&quot;...A sub-skill?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; He replied, &quot;Shinkirou no Mizu-Hansha (Mirage of 
Water Reflection). While you are in this room and while this 
room is affected by the Kogoeta Kankyou; the reality of your 
surrounds will be distorted. The Shinkirou no Mizu-Hansha 
technique shall reflect all the attacks that you launch at the 
ice with any of your weapons. But the funny thing is... this 
reflection isn&#39;t always direct... as you have just seen. Your 
attacks can be reflected from any direction that I wish to 
choose. And that is not the only thing you have to worry 
about...&quot;  

Another of Cat Mask&#39;s reflections appeared on the ice of the far 
wall. Right ahead of Shiki. This time it made the two-fingered 
sign of the shinobi too. Shiki readied herself and watched the 
image with stern eyes. Until she felt danger from behind her. 
Shiki instantly gripped her sword hilt, turned around and 
slashed. All in the blink of an eye. So fast that she herself 
wasn&#39;t even aware of what she was attacking. As it turns out, it 
was a deathly sharp icicle. Jagged enough and large enough to 
skewer Shiki like a fish. The girl sliced through the icicle 
before it touched her. It was cut into two even pieces. Those 
two pieces crashed and shattered on the ground from the impact. 
It broke into a tiny set of fragments. Then it all evaporated 
into water and melted back into the ice beneath it. Like it had 
never been there at all. 

&quot;Heh, heh, heh...&quot; Cat Mask laughed again, &quot;You let that guard 
of yours down again. This other ability is called Shinkirou no 
Kouri-Toge (Mirage of Ice Thorn). Not only can my icy move of 
Kogoeta Kankyou reflect your weapon-based attacks... but the ice 
can also attack you from multiple angles at multiple, limitless 
times. What will you do to counter that, my dear Shiki-san?&quot;

&quot;...Shit...&quot; Shiki scowled as Cat Mask&#39;s reflection disappeared 
again. This man was skilled. A lot more so than Ryoko and 
Zanmaru. It seemed as if Hirotsugu was stepping up his plans. 
Now he was sending the stronger members of the Six Orochi to 
kill her. And Cat Mask was clearly better than those Shiki had 
encountered before. Not only had this man predicted Shiki&#39;s 
methods of sneaking into the Diet Building... he had also set up 
one fine trap for her. This Kogoeta Kankyou skill was probably 
one of the most powerful abilities that Shiki had seen in her 
young life. It properly reflected the great development of 
Kori-jutsu (Art of Ice) throughout the years. And was probably 
something that took years for Cat Mask to develop and perfect. 
It made Shiki wonder why he wasted his time serving scum like 
the Honshu Koga.

Before she could debate that; a second attack came. It was 
Shinkirou no Kouri-Toge again. From both walls, right and left, 
burst up an ice spike. Sharp and keen. Cat Mask&#39;s reflection 
came up from behind both of them. Then the ice spikes were shot 
straight at their target. Shiki blinked violently. She quickly 
rolled forwards, sheathing Miyuki mid-action. She skidded to one 
side of the collision as the two ice-spikes rammed into each 
other brutally. The ice-spikes shattered against each other like 
fragile glass in a sparkling burst of glistening frost. Cat Mask 
had not been kidding when he said that he could attack at more 
than one time.  

But Shiki didn&#39;t shrink or cower. The girl let her head lull. 
Cat Mask watched this from one of his reflections on the 
opposite wall. He heard a low chuckle escape her lips, dampened 
down by the wrapping over her mouth. 

&quot;Why are you laughing?&quot; Cat Mask curiously questioned.

Shiki looked over at the ice reflection. &quot;...It&#39;s just that... 
since I arrived in Tokyo... you are the first person whom I have 
actually needed to go all out on.&quot;

&quot;Empty threats,&quot; Cat Mask responded, &quot;All those shallow bluffs 
and that outrageous bravado will get you nowhere against shinobi 
such as myself.&quot; 

But then Shiki laughed once more &quot;Heh, heh, heh. Don&#39;t be so 
sure I&#39;m lying...&quot;

A second image appeared behind Shiki. Obviously to try that 
double attack again. Perfect. Just what Shiki needed. The young 
woman reached down into her side leg pocket and pulled a 
shuriken out of it. She drew back her right arm and then flung 
it straight at the first of the reflections on the wall at the 
other side of the room. 

Cat Mask&#39;s voice rang out again. &quot;Foolishness! You know that 
won&#39;t work on me!&quot;

All Shiki was did was smirk and pulled up the two-fingered sign 
again. She kept her eyes ahead of her and didn&#39;t blink at all. 
As the shuriken neared the first Cat Mask reflection; it morphed 
into the Shinkirou no Mizu-Hansha form. That watery mirror. 
Which was the right moment for what Shiki had planned. 

&quot;Shunhenkou!&quot;

The twin images of both the Cat Mask reflections gave surprised 
glares as Shiki disappeared with a large puff of rising mystic 
smoke. But was even more shocking than that was the fact that 
she reappeared in front of the watery mirror! And the shuriken 
was replaced in her previous position! The rear Cat Mask 
reflection gasped as the shuriken went straight for it and 
shattered the ice it had been cast on. Long before any attempt 
could have been made for the Shinkirou no Mizu-Hansha 
sub-technique. The remaining Cat Mask reflection spurted up a 
guzzle of blood from the mouth past his Kabuki Mask; which then 
sickly splattered against the glassy hoarfrost from the inside. 
He had been hit from the stomach. Obviously by the shuriken. The 
image of the Cat Mask reflection lurched forwards in the ice 
wall. Stunned by the attack. And stunned by the skill of action 
that brought about the unwelcome results.  

The reflection coughed up more blood, then spoke. &quot;...You 
used... Shunhenkou... to switch positions with the shuriken...?&quot;

&quot;You betcha,&quot; Shiki responded &quot;There&#39;s a lot more to me than 
just throwing around shuriken. You might be able cast 
reflections and attack more than once at any specific time... 
but you can&#39;t reflect attacks more than once at a time. It was 
just a matter of catching you off guard when you tried a double 
attack.&quot;

&quot;Very... clever...&quot; Cat Mask&#39;s voice offered. 

Shiki then brought up the two-fingered sign of the shinobi 
another time. &quot;... It ain&#39;t over yet, my intelligent bastard. 
Kori-jutsu is indeed a powerful and neglected form of Elemental 
Ninjutsu. But there is one other elemental Ninjutsu form that is 
enough to counter its vast powers. An art that I am more than 
familiar with...&quot;

Hi-jutsu or Art of Fire. Now Cat Mask was beginning to realize 
that he was not the only one who was affiliated with a natural 
element. Shiki took a deep breath and made another two-finger 
sign with her free hand. She brought one before the other and 
concentrated. She had to complete this before Cat Mask went on 
the attack again. Which he did. The image of his now weakened 
reflection appeared somewhere else. To a sheet of ice on the 
left. And from that came another ice spike. But only one this 
time. Cat Mask was now fully aware of his new found weakness in 
double attacking via the sub-techniques of Kogoeta Kankyou. The 
frost spike quickly shot from the pane of frosty ice and zoomed 
for the Morioka girl like a bullet. Shiki didn&#39;t hazard a glance 
at the encroaching ice spike. But remained as she was. Then 
waved her right hand downwards with a call of attack;

&quot;Monosugoi Uma Hitoiki!&quot;
(Tremendous Horse Breath!) 

A huge gusting ring of hot flames burst open around Shiki. They 
encircled her for a brief second then quickly spread in an 
outwards motion; across the chilled air of the ice-covered room. 
The dancing flame ring invoked by the Monosugoi Uma Hitoiki made 
impact with the Shinkirou no Kouri-Toge twenty metres from 
Shiki. And the flame wave burnt straight through it. The wave 
then proceeded to ram into the sheets of ice from all sides of 
the room. And set them all alight. The atmosphere and colour of 
that room began to switch from cold and blue to slightly warm 
and orange. The whole of the room shook from the immense force 
of the ninja conjuration. Soon the ice began to melt all around 
from the intense heat. Leaving nowhere for Cat Mask to hide 
except for the ceiling. And that was bound to thaw out from the 
new high temperatures anyway. 

The voice of the young male ninja yelled out. &quot;So it&#39;s true! 
Hi-jutsu! The Art of Fire!&quot; 

Shiki pulled another of those bloodthirsty grins (though Cat 
Mask could not have seen it because of her face wrappings). &quot;You 
sound surprised. My Chi is infused with the element of fire. 
Just like Zanmaru-san&#39;s was with lightning and yours is with 
ice.&quot; 

At that point; the ice on the ceiling began to crack a little. 
Then it shattered. Shiki looked up as this happened. Cat Mask 
burst through the ice up above. The only place he could have 
been. It was about to collapse. His body fell downwards at that 
reasonable height. But he was not jumping. He was definitely 
falling. He collided to the ice-melting ground with a thump; 
which knocked off his facial cat mask. Shiki could see where her 
shuriken had hit him. On the edge of the stomach, a wound that 
was now gushing blood. He was weakening fast. From both the 
shuriken-wound and the strain of the Kogoeta Kankyou on his Chi. 
It seemed like this fight was over. Shiki lowered her hands and 
slowly began walking to the de-masked Cat Mask. She stopped two 
metres before him and crouched downwards. 

&quot;So, your trump card wasn&#39;t as effective as you-&quot; Shiki started 
the statement off with a jeering tone. But she stopped herself. 
And a haunted glare passed through her eyes as she looked at 
this bleeding ninja&#39;s face. Figuring out his real identity. 

&quot;It... can&#39;t be...&quot; Shiki said, startled, &quot;...H-Hibuki-san...?&quot;
