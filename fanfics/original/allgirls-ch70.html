The second half of &quot;All Girls School&quot;

In truth, there is no better place to be

Than falling out of darkness still to see

Without a premonition, could you tell me where we stand?

I&#39;d hate to lose this light before we land

And when I feel like I can feel once again

Let me stay awhile, soak it in awhile

If we can hold on, we can fix what is wrong

Buy a little time for this head of mine
Haven for us

&quot;The New Beginnings&quot;

It felt like it had been more than a few weeks since she walked those 
familiar halls, probably because during winter break, she had changed so 
much. From the way she acted to the way she felt about things, from her 
relationship with other people to her beloved, even the way she looked 
on the outside: there was no doubt the young woman had undergone a 
terrific chance, and would probably continue to change even more as the 
school year got into its second semester. She wondered if anybody would 
recognize her.

She came to her first class and found the door locked, which meant that 
Miss Madsen hadn&#39;t come in yet. She leaned back against the 
plaster-brick wall and waited, glad that it was colder outside than in. 
Thoughts came to her in the silence, like girls passing by here and 
there, none of them giving any familiar response. It was like she was a 
totally different person to them. She just had to smile at that. 
Thoughts of other things came to her as well, such as her family (and 
what seemed to be her extended family), and the tsunami disaster that 
had happened recently. She wanted to do something for those people, 
anything&#151;but she had nothing of worth to donate, or even money to spare.

&quot;Must mean my conscience is alive and well,&quot; she murmured. Out of the 
corner of her eye, she spotted her teacher walking to her classroom, and 
noticed that she too had changed. Her hair was shorter, by six inches at 
least.

&quot;Hey Miss Madsen!&quot; she exclaimed happily, waving. Hitomi Madsen stopped 
and gazed at the young woman greeting her, not knowing who she was. She 
was average in height, and slightly on the thin side, and had deep brown 
eyes to contrast the glowing yellow of her hair. She looked ready for 
the real world with sensible khaki slacks, a white long-sleeved 
button-down dress shirt, and tiny earrings, but Hitomi still didn&#39;t know 
who she was.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she greeted neutrally. &quot;Do I...know you, miss?&quot;

&quot;What, you don&#39;t recognize me?&quot; she said, her voice oddly familiar. 
Hitomi took a closer look, and it suddenly clicked. No wonder she didn&#39;t 
recognize her&#151;she had changed her hair color.

&quot;...Miss Blair?&quot;

&quot;Yup, that&#39;s me, old Alex Blair. What, didn&#39;t you know that I&#39;m a 
natural blonde?&quot;

&quot;Um...no,&quot; stammered the older woman, clearly flushed and impressed. 
&quot;You look so...beautiful! I never imagined&#151;&quot;

&quot;That I could care enough about my physical appearance to look like 
this? Or that the caterpillar could become a butterfly?&quot; Hitomi smiled 
humbly. It was Miss Blair, all right, no longer the Furious Hail from 
days of old.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, you just look so different, but I like the change Something 
must&#39;ve happened to you over the holidays.&quot;

&quot;You could...say that.&quot; Just then a girl passed by, one Hitomi instantly 
recognized. She said hello to them both, stopped to plant a small kiss 
on Alex&#39;s pink lips, and left with a joyful grin. Alex smiled and parted 
her long blonde hair, slightly embarrassed over the public display of 
affection. Hitomi raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Oh, so that...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, my girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Corona Marcos,&quot; she mused. &quot;You know, when I think about it, it makes 
perfect sense. You two would be wonderful for each other.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m no longer riding that angst bus, ma&#39;am. I&#39;m seriously trying 
to be good here.&quot;

&quot;Well it&#39;s plainly working.&quot; She smiled, proud that her student was 
finally having some good in her life&#151;she deserved it after that Hell she 
had been through&#151;and unlocked the door. Alex walked inside and took a 
breath of the familiar air.

&quot;Ah...place hasn&#39;t changed at all.&quot;

&quot;No, it hasn&#39;t. Oh, good morning, ladies.&quot; She turned to greet two as 
they came in, and they returned it.

&quot;Mornin&#39;, Miss M!&quot;

&quot;Guten morgen, Frau Madsen!&quot; Alex waved happily as Gabrielle and Lilian, 
shamelessly giggling and holding hands, managed to squeeze themselves 
into the room. Neither of them recognized Alex at first&#151;they too thought 
she looked prettier&#151;and joined her for a conversation. Hitomi was happy 
that the girl who had begun the year as one of the most hopeless cases, 
one who had been thrown around from one place to the next, never knowing 
the love and care of another, had transformed so greatly into this 
beautiful, energetic, smiling creature. A good semester&#39;s work indeed!

&quot;Well,&quot; she said to the trio, &quot;I&#39;ll be on my way. Feel free to talk 
amongst yourselves and welcome everybody else in.&quot; Alex raised her hand, 
so polite. Madsen smiled. &quot;Class hasn&#39;t started yet, Miss Blair, so no 
need for formality.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay. Uh, hey, I was wondering, where do you go between the time 
you open that door and the time school starts?&quot;

&quot;If you must know, I visit a friend.&quot;

&quot;Miss Keeping, right? Isn&#39;t she your girlfriend?&quot; Hitomi&#39;s face turned a 
color as Gabrielle blurted out. She smiled shyly.

&quot;Yes, actually. I&#39;m not ashamed to admit it. I assume none of you have 
any problems with that!&quot; The trio all smiled, all of them knowing the 
joys and puzzles of loving members of their own gender. Even Lilian was 
happy; she wished her teacher and former love interest farewell as she 
left. Alex quickly bolted out so she could say hello to Corona; Lilian 
snuck a few smooches with Gabrielle once they were gone.

......

Abigail Keeping looked up from her work as she heard a knock at the 
door. Opening it, she smiled brightly as her friend and lover&#151;well, not 
quite a lover yet&#151;Hitomi Madsen stood before her, hands tied shyly 
behind her back.

&quot;Hitomi! I missed you! How have you been?&quot; They embraced and kissed 
deeply. Thankfully, nobody was in Keeping&#39;s class yet to witness it.

&quot;Oh, quite good. Have you seen Alexandria Blair lately? It&#39;s like she&#39;s 
a whole nother&#39; person!&quot;

&quot;I know, I saw, and Corona too. I heard they&#39;re an item.&quot;

&quot;Indeed indeed. I&#39;m quite happy for them.&quot;

&quot;Yes, so am I. Poor Corona, too, being so tortured like that. I find it 
rather unlikely, albeit sweet, that she takes such a shine to an 
equally-tormented soul like Miss Blair. It seems they canceled each 
other out, though, so I guess all they really needed was for somebody to 
love them.&quot;

&quot;Like us,&quot; mused Madsen. Abby smiled and accepted another kiss; Madsen&#39;s 
tongue was invited inside, and together they wrestled lustfully. Abby 
hissed in frail breaths as she felt the younger woman&#39;s gnawing lips on 
her neck and throat&#151;&quot;Oh!&quot; She blushed as she felt Madsen&#39;s hand touching 
her crotch, searching for a way inside.

&quot;We should find somewhere private to do that,&quot; she intoned playfully. 
Madsen gasped, as if they were conspiring.

&quot;You mean the bathrooms? But that&#39;s so naughty!&quot;

&quot;Why not? Our love first found root in a bathroom.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather get you in bed.&quot; Abby weakened in the knees as Hitomi curled 
her tongue around her ear&#151;&quot;Ohhh...&quot; She felt herself ready to surrender, 
ready to be taken&#151;to hell with it, ready to be fucked mad&#151;in her own 
classroom! She had not relished in such carnal pastimes in weeks, 
choosing to spend her holiday abroad in her home country of Romania, 
away from the love of her Hitomi. But now...she was a dam ready to 
burst.

&quot;Bathroom,&quot; she barked, managing to compose herself. &quot;One down the 
hall.&quot; She led Hitomi there, wary of eyes, and snuck inside once the 
coast was clear. Madsen forced her long-absent lover into a stall, 
locked the door, and removed her black skirt clumsily. The panties were 
forced down; Abby Keeping gasped, closed her eyes, and tilted her head 
back as Hitomi pleasured her right there in the school bathroom...

Fifteen minutes later, everyone was in the classroom, most of them 
wondering where their teacher was now. She usually popped by around that 
time, whistling a tune or carrying a book, a smile on her face no matter 
what. Yet the first bell rang, and she was still missing. Thankfully, 
most of the girls knew exactly where she was, and a few could even guess 
accurately what she was doing. That didn&#39;t stop them from grinning like 
idiots.

Finally, Hitomi walked into her classroom, slightly disheveled, and 
closed the door. She excused herself and took a moment to straighten her 
hair, which had been let loose for that day. She still looked pretty and 
commanding, a real role model, but her face was brighter than before, 
her eyes merrier. Most everyone knew why.

&quot;I am sorry,&quot; she managed, gasping faintly. &quot;I do apologize for being 
late. I have no permissible excuse; please forgive me. I owe you all 
better than that. Please accept five bonus points each for being so 
considerate.&quot;

&quot;Gift accepted,&quot; called Olivia. Mira smiled.

&quot;So how was your visit with Miss Keeping?&quot;

&quot;Enjoyable, as always,&quot; she answered calmly. She let them interpret that 
however they wished. Noticing their collective smiles, though, made her 
blush and relax. &quot;I see. I guess it&#39;s apparent to everyone where I&#39;ve 
been and what I&#39;ve been up to. Well, I may as well confirm it: she and I 
are in love with each other. I know a few of you may think that 
wrong&#151;even if we were not both women, finding a romance in the same line 
of work is usually unprofessional&#151;but circumstances led me to accept her 
into my heart, and I stand by that.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve no problem with it, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Blake. &quot;We&#39;re happy for you two. 
We actually took a poll and agreed&#151;we think you and Miss Keeping make a 
great couple.&quot;

&quot;A poll?&quot; she blurted in disbelief. &quot;I think you should spend your time 
with other pursuits! But I deserve it, don&#39;t I? I am sorry.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize,&quot; said Zane. &quot;We understand. It&#39;s hard breaking away 
from somebody you love.&quot;

&quot;We should get down to business,&quot; sighed Madsen, parting her hair. &quot;I&#39;ve 
delayed us enough. First, let me greet every one of you properly: Good 
morning, ladies.&quot;

And in unison, they all said, &quot;Good morning, Miss Madsen.&quot;

&quot;Welcome back to Stanton.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. Welcome back yourself.&quot;

&quot;I am glad to be back,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;Let&#39;s begin, shall we? I 
would like for all of you to come up in front of the class and tell 
everyone what you did over the winter holiday, even if you think it 
wasn&#39;t special. If you have nothing to say, at least entertain us with 
what you would&#39;ve liked to have done. Even I shall say something. Now, 
Miss O&#39;Shannon.&quot; Everyone looked to Gabrielle, whose face was as red as 
her hair. She grinned shyly and tried ducking in her seat (for the 
record, Lilian&#39;s face was just as bright).

&quot;Uh, may I please pass for now, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Since you asked so politely, yes. I won&#39;t pressure you. Volunteers 
only.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go.&quot; It was Alex Blair, who&#151;if the girls recalled&#151;had been the 
last to go up previously, when the whole school year started. And now 
she was first. Madsen smiled warmly.

&quot;Excellent, Miss Blair. Two bonus points for volunteering first.&quot; Alex 
smiled, put her hands behind her back, and gazed at her fellow 
classmates, many of whom she considered friends.

&quot;I bet you&#39;re all wondering why the heck I&#39;m blonde all of a sudden. 
It&#39;s my natural hair color; I started dyeing it when I was about 
fourteen. I used to hate it until just recently. My girlfriend is 
absolutely nuts about it&#151;um, Corona Marcos. Anyway, most of my break I 
spent with Corona&#151;we shared New Year&#39;s together, plus a little 
something-something on the side!!&quot; A few of the girls whistled and 
grinned, knowing just what she meant.

Blair concluded and let others go up, most of them having good if not 
great tales. Some had spent the days with loved ones, or family, or 
working dreary jobs, like Olivia. Others had made friends. Many had 
pushed the boundaries of their relationships, or ended them altogether. 
Finally, Gabrielle felt she had sat through enough. She looked at 
Lilian, who smiled in support, and stood up&#151;along with the albino. 
Madsen gave them an inquisitive look.

&quot;We&#39;d like to go up together, if ya don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;And why is that?&quot;

&quot;Our stories are...connected.&quot; Gabrielle&#39;s friends smiled sweetly, 
knowing what was in store. Madsen permitted it, curious as to how these 
two, whom she loved and respected, had gotten closer since last she saw 
them. Needless to say, it was quite a lovely story, though some parts 
obviously had to be edited for time restraints (and for explicit 
content). The entire story was far too long to speak of in a few 
minutes; it demanded its own section for development.

Next time: I think you all know what&#39;s coming!
