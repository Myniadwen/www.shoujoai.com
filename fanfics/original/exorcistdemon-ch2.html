<h1>The Exorcist and the Demon (part 2 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>      Eveon was really having doubts about how successful they were going to be. The 
exorcist was a total joke and they had gotten lost in the forest 3 times already. 
&quot;Alright... this has got to be it,&quot; said Krystal. &quot;Sorry it took so long, Eveon. The demon 
set up an illusionary trap.&quot;

      The young girl let out a relieved sigh, but it caught in her throat as she looked up 
the path. There was a huge, foreboding mansion in front of them. &quot;When did that get there?!&quot;

      Krystal answered her shout with a shrug. &quot;Demons are sneaky, but not modest...&quot; With a 
sigh, the exorcist and the young girl entered the building. 

***** 

      It didn&#39;t take them long to navigate themselves into the ballroom. It was pitch black 
and Krystal had Eveon stand behind her. She could feel the presence of the demon. The air 
became tense and Eveon watched in the darkness as Krystal started unwrapping the long bundle 
she kept on her back.

      Both of them flinched as they heard the booming laugh of the demon. &quot;Ah, I see that 
little Eveon has finally showed up.&quot; The blonde girl flinched and looked over at the 
exorcist, worried. &quot;If you&#39;re here to save your precious Mina, I suggest you head over to 
the guest room... she&#39;s been dying to see you.&quot;

      Eveon let out a sharp gasp as Krystal pushed her towards the door of the ballroom. 
&quot;You go find Mina. I will take care of the demon,&quot; said the exorcist. Eveon nodded and 
trotted off. As soon as she was down the hall, the doors to the ballroom slammed shut and 
the candles on the side started to light themselves.

      Krystal turned towards the center of the room as she heard the clicking of heels and a 
sultry, smooth voice. &quot;Well, well, well. They sent an exorcist after me?&quot; When all the 
candles were lit, it revealed a young woman in a black dress. She had lavender eyes and long 
brown hair. Her beauty shocked Krystal, but also the fact that it was a female demon 
terrorizing the town.

      &quot;Yet, they only sent me a scrawny boy,&quot; said the demon, referring to Krystal and her 
disguise. &quot;I am completely insulted. I was thinking some big, strong idiot would come to 
rescue the damsel in distress.&quot;

      Krystal removed a sword from the bundle of cloth, but simply held it at her side. &quot;Are 
you the one... tainting the girls of the town?&quot;

      The demon just laughed to herself before answering. &quot;Of course. Why? Were you 
expecting a male? Have you never seen a woman take pleasure in other women?&quot; Krystal knew 
this conversation was starting to go down a strange path.

      &quot;Regardless, I am here to ask you to please stop doing... whatever it is you do to,&quot; 
said Krystal. The demon just laughed in her face.

      &quot;I&#39;m surprised that you would even bother asking. And you&#39;re blushing, aren&#39;t you? I 
may not be able to see through that scarf, but... hmm, it was very polite of you to ask, but 
I&#39;m afraid I won&#39;t stop.&quot; Krystal inwardly sighed. She always asked demons to stop, but they 
never did and then she always ended up fighting them...

      &quot;I&#39;m not hurting those girls at all... I just enter their dreams and expand their 
horizons,&quot; said the demon, who was getting much pleasure from embarrassing the exorcist. He 
really was a strange boy, but it didn&#39;t matter. He couldn&#39;t stop her from doing what she 
wanted to.

      &quot;Why did you kidnap Mina? She&#39;s much too young as compared to the other girls that... 
you know...&quot; Krystal said, awkwardly. The demon replied, &quot;Oh, Mina. I just helped her out 
with a little &#39;problem&#39; she had. I was just waiting for some one to come pick her up.&quot;

      That surprised Krystal. The demon went through all the trouble of kidnapping Mina, but 
was willing to give her back? &quot;Demon, I am afraid that I must use force unless you are 
willing to stop... whatever it is you have done to those girls!&quot;

      The demon giggled at Krystal&#39;s words. &quot;Why are you so afraid to use the word &#39;sex&#39;?&quot; 
She asked, allowing dark energy to gather in her palm. This would be fun... 

***** 

      It took Eveon a minute to realize that she had no clue where the guest room was. She 
had been running through the mansion and now she skidded to a stop, thinking. Where could 
Mina be...? She tried to focus a bit and... well, Eveon was trying to sense where her friend 
was, but she would never admit that. Finally, she found a door in the hallway that called 
for her.

      She turned the knob and entered, only to find that the room was complete dark. Eveon 
took out a lighter that the exorcist had given her and lit a candle on the nearby dresser. 
It was then that she noticed Mina lying on the bed. She walked over to her and noticed that 
she was clad in a Victorian style white dress with her black hair in its signature state of 
disarray. Weird choice of clothes, but whatever. Eveon sat down on the bed and gently shook 
her friend. &quot;Mina... Mina?&quot;

      Her friend&#39;s eyelids opened to reveal blue eyes. &quot;...Eveon...? What...?&quot; As Mina sat 
up, she recognized her blonde friend, but Eveon hugged her so tightly that no words could 
come out of her mouth. &quot;Mina! You&#39;re okay! I&#39;m so sorry... this was my entire fault, but I&#39;m 
here to save you!&quot; Mina was speechless, but let herself sink into Eveon&#39;s embrace.

      &quot;Eveon... you came to save me?&quot; Her blonde friend nodded and Mina gave her a bright 
smile before hugging her just as hard. &quot;...Did the demon do anything to you,&quot; asked Eveon. 
&quot;No, I&#39;m perfectly fine. I was just... kidnapped,&quot; Mina replied.

      Eveon lifted her off of the bed by the hand and Mina blushed. &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get 
going. The exorcist is fighting the demon right now, I guess, but he doesn&#39;t look that 
strong. We should probably escape while we can...&quot;  

***** 

      The demon gritted her teeth in frustration before launching another volley of dark 
energy at the exorcist. With a few swings of her holy blade, Krystal completely evaporated 
the energy. &quot;Tell me your name, exorcist,&quot; said the demon, very curious as to who this 
person was. &quot;I cannot tell you for the sake of keeping my personal life out of this.&quot;

      The woman just smirked and let the dark energy gather as a maelstrom in her hand. The 
exorcist wouldn&#39;t be able to fend this off. &quot;I wanted to know what to put on your grave, you 
foolish boy... My name is Isaka so you may tell those in the afterlife who sent you!&quot;

      The dark flames raced towards her, but Krystal concentrated on her blade and let out 
her own wave of holy power. Isaka was stunned as the white torrent headed towards her. 
This... this couldn&#39;t be happening, right? Nobody could be strong enough to take her down 
with such an attack...

      It engulfed her and Isaka let out a yell of pain as she fell to her knees. She barely 
had time to look up as she felt the cool metal of a sword against her throat. &quot;You have 
lost, Isaka.&quot;

      She looked up at Krystal with slight anger, but her eyes danced merrily with respect. 
&quot;I guess this is it then. You can bring my head to the villagers and-&quot; Her words were cut 
off as Krystal took the sword away from her neck and let it rest at her side.

      &quot;You&#39;ve been beat. There&#39;s no point in me killing you... not every demon deserves to 
die.&quot; Krystal smiled through her scarf and Isaka only stared in disbelief. &quot;You... you&#39;re 
sparing me?&quot; The exorcist nodded her head before explaining, &quot;You haven&#39;t killed anyone and 
there has been little harm done to those girls. If you don&#39;t learn your lesson, then I will 
just have to beat you again.&quot;

      Isaka slowly rose to her feet with a wicked grin on her face. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to 
regret this, boy. I won&#39;t continue bothering those girls, but I am going to find a way to 
get you back.&quot; With a laugh she disappeared in a whorl of shadows, leaving Krystal slightly 
confused. It was a good thing that Isaka didn&#39;t know she was a girl.

      That would be bad. 

***** 

      Krystal was packing up all her gear when Eveon showed up in her room. &quot;Oh, Eveon. 
What&#39;s wrong?&quot; The blonde girl&#39;s face was streaked with tears and the exorcist went over to 
embrace her. Instead, she collapsed on the bed, wiping her tears. &quot;I... I&#39;m so confused...&quot; 
Krystal sat down next to her, silent. &quot;I think... I think the demon did do something to 
Mina... the demon did something to her, just like what happened to the others!&quot;

      Krystal put a comforting arm around Eveon&#39;s shoulders. &quot;What? What did the demon do to 
the others?&quot; She remembered that the priest had told her that the afflicted girls no longer 
became interested in men, but he never explained what was wrong with them.

      &quot;When the demon entered the dreams of some of the girls, it just started off as... you 
know, naughty dreams. Eventually, the dreams would stop, but the girls...&quot; Eveon bit her lip 
and blushed. &quot;...the girls weren&#39;t interested in boys anymore...&quot; Krystal caught the hint. 
Isaka had influenced those girls into being lesbians. This was definitely the weirdest thing 
Krystal had ever encountered.

      &quot;I mean, the girls were... well, the girls the demon went after were already kind of 
iffy on whether they were or not, so I never worried about it. But Mina... Mina&#39;s the 
perfect example of a &#39;good girl&#39;. She&#39;s pretty, kind, smart and she dresses like a &#39;good 
girl&#39;. I&#39;m just a tomboy who&#39;s a bit of an outsider, but we&#39;ve always been friends...&quot; Eveon 
stopped and let out a slight sob.

      &quot;...I already checked to see if Mina was tainted by the demon, but she wasn&#39;t Eveon,&quot; 
said Krystal. Mina had no signs on her of Isaka&#39;s influence and Eveon said that the girl was 
just as she remembered. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with Mina, Eveon?&quot;

      The blonde girl turned to her. &quot;She said... Mina said that she loved me.&quot;
