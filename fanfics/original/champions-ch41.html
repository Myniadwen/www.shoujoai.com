Joanna White could do nothing but smile and weep for joy. After 
suffering for so long&#151;a week it seemed&#151;under the oppressive belief that 
Aura Valeria had died violently, it was still difficult to accept that 
she was there, right in front of her, smiling back. She wanted to run up 
and embrace her, just to ascertain the reality of the moment, but it was 
too good to ruin even with happiness. They approached each other slowly, 
both of them ghosts in a sense, still unable to believe...

&quot;AURIE!!!!!&quot; Valeria was suddenly tackled hard by a green blur, and 
before she knew it, Julie Smith pressed her mouth against her lips. Her 
eyes flew open in shock and she nearly lost her balance. Needless to 
say, both Joanna and Kristen, who had stepped outside with Julie just at 
that moment, were equally surprised.

&quot;YOU&#39;RE ALIVE!!&quot; screamed Lurker, too happy to bear. She hugged and 
kissed poor Aura wildly, declaring again and again, &quot;Aurie, Aurie, I 
missed you, I missed you! I love you I love you I love you!!!&quot;

&quot;I...love you too, Julie,&quot; managed the unfortunate girl, desperately 
trying to pry her friend off. Julie clung stubbornly and only moved when 
she was told that if she didn&#39;t let go, Aura would most likely 
suffocate. Once she could breathe, everyone there immediately started 
asking questions, and soon more and more people were coming out to see 
the spectacle. Things became too loud to bear, so Aura simply covered 
her ears and waited for everyone to realize her distress.

Oh, how weak she looked, how frail, how fragile, how wrought with 
disaster...

&quot;Everybody be quiet!&quot; somebody shouted. &quot;Quiet! SILENCE!!&quot; The crowd 
hushed slowly. Bubblegum Black made her way through the group, knelt 
down next to her friend, smiled, and flung her arms around her.

&quot;Welcome home, Aura.&quot; Valeria merely nodded; she felt empty, as if she 
had forgotten her soul when she came back from the dead. At last she 
stood up and got some air, and faced everyone that had came out to see 
her with weary eyes.

&quot;I know you all are wondering what happened to me,&quot; she began. &quot;And I do 
intend to tell you my story, but not right now. I&#39;d like to rest, if you 
don&#39;t mind. I&#39;ve had quite a harrowing experience, and this is the last 
thing I need.&quot; Shame now overcame the crowd, as they realized what they 
were putting their friend through, so they dispersed and waited 
patiently for her to revive. That she was alive and well was good enough 
for the time being. Aura followed Xianq, and laid down in her bed to 
take a long nap; she slept well into the afternoon, and woke up looking 
much better, though there was still an unidentified sadness in her eyes.

After eating a small meal, she asked for everyone to come into the main 
lobby of the building, and here it was that she told her fascinating 
tale...

......

&quot;...Well, good evening, all,&quot; began Aura Valeria as she stood in front 
of the crowd. &quot;It&#39;s nice to see all of you again. Some of you I missed 
very much. Others, I wish I had known better before my...untimely 
departure. Let me first say what a joy it is to be back here, and 
that...yes, the reports of my death were all false. This is me, in the 
flesh, alive and recovering from my ordeal&#151;and what an ordeal it was! 
I&#39;m sure you all want to know what happened to me shortly after what 
everybody told you, so I&#39;ll get to the point.

&quot;From what I&#39;ve heard around here, the last time I was seen, I was being 
forced into that warehouse full of weapons and...erm, explosive devices, 
by one of the members of the so-called Dead Zodiac, Darred the 
Numb-Mind. I&#39;m guessing you all figured out, too late on your part, that 
Darred could literally numb minds&#151;that is, meld them to believe whatever 
he wishes. Only Marissa saw through it, with her powers, but even her 
fast rescue was too late. Darred grabbed me and rushed inside the 
dangerous place, explosives in tow&#151;and that was apparently my end.

&quot;I almost wish it had been. I did not die. I wasn&#39;t even burned. By some 
otherworldly magic, I&#39;m guessing teleportation, both Darred and myself 
were teleported away before the blast could take us. We arrived 
somewhere in an underground bunker of some sorts, and that&#39;s where my 
story really begins...&quot;

.........

The initial shock of nearly being engulfed in flames took too long to 
wear off. I honestly thought I had died, but what sort of afterlife was 
so dark and...cold? Was I in Hell after all? I had been too horrified by 
what happened to know anything, or to even do anything. Before I knew 
it, I had been tossed on the ground and beaten into unconsciousness.

When I woke up, I found myself sitting uncomfortably on a chair in the 
dark. My hands were tied behind my back, and a thick rope bound me to 
the chair. Even my legs were subdued; I was trapped, and I was about to 
find out by whom. I had difficulty adjusting to the darkness of the 
place. The smell was incredibly stale and it was a bit damp, but I also 
remember feeling cold. My chest and abdomen ached from the beating I 
got, but I would recover. I was more worried about where I was, and how 
I got there.

&quot;All that trouble for this? Blimey!&quot; I heard a voice say. It sounded 
like Darred&#39;s, only more rat-like than before. I groaned.

&quot;Do not let her simple appearance deceive you, Darred the Numb-Mind,&quot; 
said another voice, this one wheezy but strong. &quot;Though on the surface 
she seems like nothing, there is more to this girl than even you know. 
Did you really believe what I told you earlier?&quot;

&quot;What, that she had the skill to make people lucky and such?&quot; replied 
Darred&#39;s voice. &quot;That she could influence them just by bein&#39; around em&#39;? 
Well, no, not really. She looks like a common little brat to me.&quot;

&quot;I assure you,&quot; whispered the older voice with chilling strength, &quot;she 
is hardly common. Her capture was a part of my own grand strategy. I 
assume you have enough mind left in you to figure out why.&quot;

&quot;Urgh, no,&quot; grunted Darred, sounding disgusted. The other voice sighed.

&quot;It is a miracle you&#39;ve not been killed by your stupidity! Listen well! 
She is the very symbol of good fortune, the literal Lady of Luck. If we 
have her here, would not her powers influence us as well?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah! But what was all that about killin&#39; her, and me?&quot;

&quot;To make sure we are not pursued,&quot; he answered coolly. &quot;If they believe 
the two of you are dead, there shall be no rescue mission, and nobody 
will go after you. Besides, by &#145;killing&#39; her, I sent them quite a strong 
message.&quot;

&quot;...That you did, mate,&quot; admitted the younger voice after a pause. &quot;That 
you did. Well, I guess I understand&#151;oh, hell. Lookit this! Since you had 
to be so loud, she&#39;s heard our entire bloody conversation for the past 
two minutes or so! Didn&#39;t you see her comin&#39; to, ya crazy bastard?&quot;

&quot;No. It does not matter; let her hear what she wishes. Nobody knows 
she&#39;s here, and it will be impossible to get out. Still, I have not 
lived my many years and seen my many sights without knowledge of 
unbelievable outcomes, and so I want you and the others to prepare for 
one.&quot;

&quot;You mean there&#39;s a possibility she could escape?!&quot; Apparently, Darred 
didn&#39;t believe a &quot;common girl&quot; like me could ever be so resourceful. 
He&#39;d ultimately pay for his mistake.

&quot;You should at least know that possibilities lie everywhere,&quot; answered 
the old voice. &quot;She could actually escape and kill some of us with her 
bare hands, if she is allowed. Do not allow her, or else death will be 
your most merciful punishment.&quot;

&quot;All right, all right, I get it,&quot; snorted Darred bitterly. &quot;I&#39;ll keep a 
guard next to her, all times. Ay, since you&#39;re the one who&#39;ll have me 
hide if she escapes, who do you think should watch over her? I can&#39;t do 
it, I got plans. You-know-who gave me instructions that are not to be 
disregarded! And I fear him more than you.&quot; There was a pause that hung, 
one I didn&#39;t like. Even though the room was dark, I could see the one 
with the strong, ancient voice smiling wickedly.

&quot;She would be most uncomfortable with the lycanthrope watching over her. 
Bring &#145;the Fang&#39;, and give adequate instruction. This lady Aura is not 
to be harmed&#151;after all, she is working for us now&#151;so the Fang 
will...have her work cut out for her. I will leave you in charge of this 
matter, Darred. You will be held responsible if anything happens, be it 
good or...ill.&quot; With that last threatening statement spoken, the one 
with the ancient voice apparently stood and left.

I know now that the old man was Ezekiel the Seeker, second-in-command in 
the Dead Zodiac. That man...... I must warn you, he is both very much 
alive and active. And he is very, very powerful. If we see him 
again...we must not allow him to strike first. Once Ezekiel had left, 
Darred turned around and glared at me, perversely and wickedly. With a 
snarl of malice, he stepped towards me and reached out to touch my 
shoulder. I jerked away immediately.

&quot;Well, you&#39;re a pretty ducky. And you&#39;ve got spirit, too. I guess you 
heard the old crone talking back then. He says I can do with you as I 
like, long as I keep you alive. You know what that means, right?&quot;

&quot;Torture and rape, no doubt,&quot; I spat bitterly. &quot;Well, you won&#39;t get 
anything without a fight!&quot;

&quot;Ha!&quot; he bellowed, and a violent laughter came from out of his gut. &quot;A 
fight, you say? What&#39;re you gonna do, ducky? You&#39;re all tied up!&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean anything to me,&quot; I snarled. He shrugged.

&quot;Oh well. Whatever. FANG! Get in here! Our respective boss has a job for 
you!&quot; Apparently, he was calling for this &quot;fang&quot; that Ezekiel had 
mentioned, the one who would be my new guard. What miserable fun. Darred 
turned back to me and smiled, almost warmly.

&quot;Well, while we&#39;re waitin&#39; for her, let&#39;s get to know each other. You 
already know my name, and I know yours. Well, I&#39;m also 23 years old, 
currently single, and...ah...gifted with a rather fashionable power, one 
might say. What about you?&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t get anything out of me,&quot; I stated firmly. He smiled, and 
then, it seemed as if the entire world was becoming hazy.

&quot;You are going to tell me what I want to know,&quot; he said in monotone. 
Blurred and confused, I suddenly had an overwhelming desire to do as he 
asked.

&quot;I...am 14 years old...soon to be fifteen in four months. 
I&#39;m...single...and...I have great gifts also. Uh...&quot;

&quot;Ah, I see. Then we&#39;re about nine years apart, not so bad! Well, that&#39;s 
good. And you&#39;re pretty, too! Skin meshed up like an elf, eyes colored 
wildly, hair checkered...yer a regular goddess, you are! Heh, but no 
less for Lady Luck. I can see why your friends love you so much. 
Perhaps, with the proper persuasion, we could be your friends as well.&quot;

&quot;Not... likely,&quot; I muttered, still feeling dizzy from his mind-control. 
I had already figured out that Darred had the ability to warp people&#39;s 
minds to his desires; I was just powerless to fight it. He sighed, and 
reached out to touch my shoulder again.

&quot;I don&#39;t wanna torture and rape you, Aura Valeria. I could never do that 
to somethin&#39; so pretty. Tell you what&#151;if I loosen your binds and set you 
free, would you be my lover? There&#39;s no chance for you to escape, so you 
may as well&#151;&quot;

&quot;I would rather swim in a pool of broken glass,&quot; I snarled bitterly. I 
wrenched away from his touch and added, &quot;And if you touch me one more 
time, I will make you feel pain.&quot; Darred just laughed, and suddenly 
slapped me with a fierce blow.

&quot;Bah, you&#39;re not so tough! Specially with them ropes around you. So you 
gonna make me feel pain now that I slapped you? Huh?&quot; He struck me 
again, and several more times, until my face was red. Each time I was 
struck, my head snapped the other way, but I refused to cry out or show 
my pain. I just recovered, and resumed staring at him, wishing for his 
death. He laughed.

&quot;Lookit them eyes...! They looks like the eyes of a wolf who&#39;s cornered 
but refuses to give up. So cold and hard...but real beautiful, too...&quot; 
The man touched my face with his rough hand, caressing my cheek with 
surprising gentleness. I stiffened and tried to avoid it, but he was 
smothering me. I finally lurched forward and sunk my teeth into his hand 
as hard as I could, causing him to scream violently. He then struck me 
so hard that I fell to the floor, chair and all.

&quot;BITCH!!&quot; he screamed. Darred started kicking me fiercely, landing his 
hard boot wherever he pleased&#151;mostly my stomach, chest, and limbs. Once 
he kicked me in the face. The pain was agonizing, but all I could do was 
brace myself and hope his rage didn&#39;t last. &quot;Stupid bitch! I&#39;ll kill you 
for that! Worthless son of a&#151;I mean, daughter of a bitch!&quot;

&quot;How clever,&quot; I managed. I spat at his feet and added, &quot;You taste 
terrible.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Darred picked me up off the floor, chair and all, only to 
slap me again. He then pressed the flat of his palm against my nose, and 
crushed it until I was nearly ready to shout. It nearly broke into 
pieces before he was stopped.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t hog her all to yourself! Leave some for me!&quot; It was a rough 
voice, perhaps feminine, but very coarse. I couldn&#39;t make it out either 
way.

&quot;Ay, Fang! It&#39;s about time, you flea-infested walking shag carpet! This 
one&#39;s giving me trouble!&quot;

&quot;Ugh, I could tell,&quot; grumbled the &quot;Fang&quot;. &quot;That foul stink you make 
almost covers up the smell of blood.&quot;

&quot;You...&quot;

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t get mad at me, Darrie,&quot; said the Fang defensively. &quot;I wasn&#39;t 
the one who bit you. You should be kinder to your captives.&quot;

&quot;I think you should be silent now,&quot; he said flatly, using the same tone 
of voice he had used on me. I could hear the Fang shivering.

&quot;...All right.&quot;

&quot;And help me pick her up.&quot;

&quot;Pick her up? But she&#39;s already&#151;&quot; Before I could prepare myself, Darred 
struck me again, using the hand I had bitten. Such defenselessness only 
fueled my rage, and the desire to escape. The Fang grunted. &quot;Oh, yeah 
right! You knocked her down, you idiot! You can pick her up!&quot;

&quot;But you will pick her up,&quot; he ordered. The Fang paused briefly before 
complying. As I opened my stinging eyes, I could see a muscular, 
long-haired, wolfish young woman approaching me. She lifted my chair and 
myself up off the ground, then gave Darred an empty glare.

&quot;Good,&quot; he said, smiling smugly.

&quot;...Whatever. Now I think you better leave before you damage our prize 
anymore. She won&#39;t be of any use to us if you keep abusing her.&quot;

&quot;The old man put me in charge of taking care of her!&quot; he insisted. The 
Fang crossed her arms.

&quot;Yeah, well, both of you wanted me to guard her, so I&#39;m taking over. Why 
don&#39;t you leave the two of us alone and go mess with someone else&#39;s 
brains? We need to have some female bonding time anyway.&quot;

&quot;But&#151;&quot;

&quot;Go,&quot; she insisted, snarling fiercely, &quot;or I&#39;ll tear out your ribcage, 
one bone at a time.&quot; Darred&#39;s nostrils flared as he stared down the 
long-haired Fang, but in the end he decided it would be better to not 
waste his powers on her, and so left the two of us alone.

Out of the frying pan and into the fire...

The woman called the Fang let out a relieved sigh, and I can&#39;t say I 
blame her for it. Her earlier comment was right: Darred had a foulness 
to him, one that I didn&#39;t care to experience again. She fluffed her long 
hair and turned to me, giving me the usual &quot;good cop&quot; smile. I knew I 
wasn&#39;t going to like this.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry he beat you like that,&quot; she said sympathetically. &quot;He&#39;s a 
total jerk. Darred&#39;s used to getting what he wants, so don&#39;t be too 
surprised at his immaturity. I, on the other hand, won&#39;t be so quick to 
anger. In fact, I actually like you. You&#39;re a little famous in our 
group, or what&#39;s left of it.&quot;

I didn&#39;t say a word.

&quot;Your friends were responsible for killing off a good portion of our 
bunch, but I&#39;m actually glad they did,&quot; she continued, pacing around the 
room like a panther. &quot;Out of all the people here, I only like the women. 
At least they&#39;re not bloodthirsty savages like Indira, Sashuo, Yan, or 
Darred. Well, Yubami creeps me out, but Emily and Naoma are all right. 
Oh, I guess I never introduced myself. I&#39;m Jane of the Fang.&quot;

&quot;I know that,&quot; I emphasized. She nodded.

&quot;Hmm. Darred and Ezekiel both have big mouths. Nobody can really control 
themselves in our group. Well, I&#39;ve gone on long enough. You&#39;re supposed 
to be my captive, so I should watch over you. Frankly, it&#39;s an honor. 
It&#39;s so nice to finally see a beautiful, strong, intelligent, 
independent woman in this line of work. Most of the no-good girls I&#39;ve 
seen just fawn around everywhere or else appear helpless. But you? I&#39;ve 
heard how your work has given our group some trouble.&quot;

&quot;You sound as if you don&#39;t like the others,&quot; I noted. She shrugged.

&quot;Not really. As a matter of fact, I really don&#39;t like working for the 
Zodiac at all. The old crone you saw and that other guy, the one with a 
number for a name, are really too creepy for me&#151;and I&#39;m a werewolf!!&quot;

&quot;A werewolf?&quot; I parroted in disbelief. I was naturally surprised, for I 
thought there was no such thing. But then I remembered Kailin and 
Marissa telling me about a wolf-girl hybrid that was being experimented 
upon in the laboratory where they had first met. Was this that same 
girl, now free and working for the enemy?

&quot;I am indeed,&quot; answered Jane. &quot;How else do you think I got the moniker 
&#145;Fang&#39;? Anyway, that&#39;s not important. The important thing is that I like 
you and respect you&#151;a lot&#151;and genuinely so. Plus, I might feel inclined 
to really help you in a way that benefits your friends.&quot;

&quot;Oh, please!&quot; I moaned, rolling my eyes. &quot;I&#39;m hardly stupid enough to 
fall for that! If it&#39;s information you want, you&#39;ll have to drag it out 
of my mouth yourself!&quot;

&quot;Oh no, no-no, it&#39;s not like that!&quot; she insisted, waving her hands for 
emphasis. &quot;I really do want to help you! Really, I do! I hate this 
organization, see! I only joined up with the Dead Zodiac because, as you 
might guess, I didn&#39;t have anywhere else to go! It was fine for awhile, 
but eventually I got to hating it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure.&quot;

&quot;Really!&quot; Jane paused for a moment, and appeared to calm down. She knelt 
to look me in the eye, and smiled softly. &quot;All right, I understand. You 
don&#39;t believe me and you don&#39;t trust me. Well, I can see why. But I&#39;m 
going to earn your trust eventually, Aura. I&#39;ll start by giving you your 
meal. If the others had their way, you&#39;d starve until you talked.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a rather cruel way to get information,&quot; I sneered. Jane frowned 
and nodded sympathetically.

&quot;Yeah. So be glad you got me. Now, I&#39;m going to untie your hands so you 
can eat like a civilized woman, but I&#39;m going to watch you carefully. 
After you finish, I&#39;ll tie you back up. Since you don&#39;t trust me just 
yet, if you make any attempt to escape, I&#39;ll stop you.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll kill me, even though you like me?&quot; I said, bitter with 
sarcasm. She shook her head.

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t say that. I just said that I&#39;ll stop you.&quot;

A day passed, and I grew weak. They fed me, but barely, and a lack of 
exercise was making my body slip into atrophy. I felt sore from sitting 
and being tied up, but it wasn&#39;t as if I was content to let nothing 
happen. Even then, I was already plotting my escape. And believe it or 
not, my friends, I was about to get some help from a very unlikely 
source. I think you all know where this is going, but I bet I can still 
surprise you...

On the morning of the next day, I was awakened from my stiff slumber by 
a slap to the face. It was from somebody I didn&#39;t know, a woman of 
silent, chilling demeanor. She gave me a bitter look and lowered a 
crossbow at me&#151;yes, I was surprised to see such an ancient weapon in the 
hands of this woman. I perspired, but said nothing. Then, my unlikely 
savior came to free me.

&quot;Enough, Yubami. We don&#39;t want to give her the wrong message. Oh, and 
you-know-who has new orders for you.&quot; The woman with the crossbow 
lowered her weapon, nodded at the unseen voice, and left. I received 
different company as Jane of the Fang came into the room. I didn&#39;t 
bother to loosen my tension in spite of her assuring smile.

&quot;Sorry. She&#39;s a little trigger-happy. That was Yubami the Great-Bow, a 
former sylvan priestess who forsook her religion or something. My advice 
to you is to never upset her. She can kill the fleas off a dog&#39;s back 
from a mile away.&quot;

&quot;Why was she in here?&quot;

&quot;Because I specifically asked for that weirdo Darred to never show his 
stinking face in here,&quot; she answered roughly. &quot;Personally, I don&#39;t like 
him, and it seems you feel the same. I trust Yubami a little more.&quot;

&quot;Why couldn&#39;t you do it?&quot; I snorted. She shrugged.

&quot;Well...it&#39;s a long story. But it involves me helping you, which is 
something I plan on doing.&quot;

&quot;Well, don&#39;t count on me doing the same,&quot; I answered with breezy 
bitterness. &quot;I&#39;m not giving your group anything, least of all much good 
fortune. And I am going to escape here.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t see how you would,&quot; answered Jane, sitting down on a chair 
opposite mine. She crossed her legs and arms, staring mindlessly. &quot;Those 
ropes are tight, and you have plenty of people who are watching you, 
some much less merciful than Yubami and Darred. Even if you got out of 
this place, you have no idea where you are. The guy with a number for 
his name sent you here from that warehouse; he can teleport people, like 
a wizard could. For all you know, this could very well be the south 
pole, or a volcanic island, or the Utter East where the world ends.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps...&quot; I murmured, trailing off thoughtfully. Needless to say, her 
bluff was not entirely implausible. I didn&#39;t know who &quot;the man with a 
number for his name&quot; was, or why he&#39;d use such power on trivial things. 
The enemy would probably have to find other means of transportation. 
Knowing the persistence of the Dead Zodiac and the frequency of their 
appearance, they had quick access to the base I was in, the Battle Diva 
temple, even MERCS headquarters. Logically, I could not have been that 
far away from home.

&quot;Well, in any case,&quot; Jane continued, &quot;I&#39;m not to let you escape, but I&#39;m 
willing to help you anyway. I bet you want to know why.&quot; I didn&#39;t say 
anything, even though this was true. &quot;Well, you won&#39;t say it,&quot; she 
continued, &quot;but I can see it in your eyes. I will tell you something, 
but not everything. Not yet.&quot; She paused, as if to lure me in. I have to 
admit, though a captive of hers, I was indeed curious.

&quot;...All I can say,&quot; she concluded quietly, &quot;is that I have never liked 
being in this group, and I want out. And I like you enough to take me 
with you. That&#39;s all. My orders for today were to keep you under 
surveillance and try to extract useful information from you, but I know 
you won&#39;t talk. Also...I&#39;ve been told that you&#39;re to have nothing to eat 
until you give us some information or good fortune. This is enforced 
under penalty of torture, even death.&quot;

I stared at her doubtfully, hungrily, daring to hope that this was a 
bluff as well. I could tell from the hauntingly sad, partially 
nonchalant look on her face that I would be disappointed. I hung my 
head, realizing the ache in my stomach from not having eaten well in a 
long time. Would it really come down to my own starvation before my 
sanity was lost? Before I could dwell on that thought, Jane rummaged 
through her pockets, pulled out something small, and stuffed it in my 
lips.

&quot;Open your mouth and eat it,&quot; she whispered carefully. I didn&#39;t trust 
her, but I was too hungry to have a choice. The food was dry, cold, and 
tasteless, but it sated my hunger like only a military ration bar could. 
I made sure I had taken in every morsel before I asked my captive why 
she risked so much for me. She smiled gently.

&quot;Like I said, I like you. I like you enough to risk my life...and I want 
you to trust me. Maybe now, you will. I&#39;ll see you soon, Aura.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re leaving?&quot;

&quot;Well, you won&#39;t get any meals until you start singing, so you won&#39;t 
need delivery service. They&#39;re sending in another guard while I&#39;m gone, 
but don&#39;t worry&#151;I&#39;ll be back if you&#39;re going to miss me that much.&quot; She 
gave me a wolfish smile, the kind that only a lycanthrope could have, 
and left like a breeze. She was immediately replaced by a nondescript 
man in uniform. I was then glad she had chosen something without an odor 
to feed to me; I would have smelled of food any other way. So, she was 
clever and quite subtle. And...perhaps it was the isolation, or the lack 
of food, or the ache in my body, but...I felt like I could really trust 
her. Maybe. Just a little.

Many long, lonely hours passed. Thankfully, the guard assigned to me 
didn&#39;t bother to extract information from me, nor did he even talk. He 
just sat on a stool, ever alert, keeping a bayonet poised at me. I&#39;m not 
sure if he believed I could escape or not; I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t want 
to risk being killed. Well, the time passed, and I became glad of the 
small ration bar provided me. Jane returned after a time, shooing the 
guard back to his original post. I noted that she had a very enticing 
tray of food with her, and my stomach acted up again.

&quot;I hope that guy wasn&#39;t a bother,&quot; she said once we were alone.

&quot;He wasn&#39;t much of anything. Your dinner?&quot; I nodded at the tray and Jane 
shook her head.

&quot;No, yours. Well, it&#39;s sort of mine, but I can give you something if you 
talk. I&#39;m sorry, I know that sounds stupid, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not the 
type to cave in like that. I&#39;m just repeating what the old badger said.&quot;

&quot;I thought you hated this place,&quot; I snorted. She frowned.

&quot;I do, really I do. But I&#39;m just saying...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I can trust you after this incident,&quot; I said to her.

&quot;Even after I risked my life?&quot;

&quot;How do I know that you weren&#39;t just making all that up?&quot; I shot back. 
She pursed her lips and nodded.

&quot;Point taken. My my, you&#39;re fiercely intelligent, Aura. Even at your 
age, you&#39;re more than a mental match for me. I have to admit, you&#39;ve got 
me beaten. Well...maybe this will make you trust me.&quot; Jane then 
proceeded to lay the tray down on another table, and opened the metal 
lid, revealing a steaming helping of a full-course meal. The smell of 
the assortment drove me mad, so much so that I almost lunged for the 
delights. I have to wonder, even now, how these creatures ever learned 
what my favorite foods were.

&quot;I&#39;ll leave that there,&quot; said Jane quietly. &quot;But first, there is 
something I must do...something that will guarantee that you trust me.&quot;

&quot;It would have to be a miracle,&quot; I admitted. Jane came closer, kneeling 
down to my level as she gave me a smile.

&quot;Well, perhaps I can produce that.&quot; And then...ugh...you&#39;re not going to 
believe this, but the lycanthropic woman kissed me, right on the mouth. 
The initial shock of the action was so great that I nearly screamed. I 
had just enough space to move my head back and snap it forward, crushing 
her forehead and knocking her away. Jane fell to the floor, surprised by 
my violent action, and laid there in amazement as she nursed her wound.

I then saw the horrifying sight of one whose heart might have been 
broken. As the woman rubbed her forehead, she gazed up at me with dark 
eyes full of painful longing: of hopes mashed, and dreams sent to 
darkness, and years of knowing no place to rest, only to wander the land 
thriving on her own foolish ideals. It was the look of freedom crushed, 
of cruel slavery&#39;s burning-hot brand, of tears that fell knowing the 
object of your greatest love and respect bore you only hate and 
mistrust. Jane stood sadly, and I almost apologized for hitting her.

&quot;This changes nothing,&quot; she whispered quietly, her eyes still locked 
onto me. &quot;I still...respect you, Aura. I have to...go...and think for 
awhile.&quot; She said nothing else. Soon, I was alone.

And then it dawned on me. I was alone. No guards. No Yubami or Darred. 
No Jane.

I was alone.

If ever there was a time for my escape, it would have to be that time.

As some of you may know, fortune is always with me, and it always seems 
to lend me methods of getting out of precarious situations. Sitting in 
the same chair with the same ropes bound around my limbs for several 
days caused me to slowly recognize the sort of method used to keep me 
from freedom, and fortune had it that the method to free myself came to 
me over the course of time. I immediately got to work. I was glad that 
my arms had been tied to each other and not the chair itself&#151;it would&#39;ve 
been harder that way. I had to twist them a certain degree and angle, 
and I had to rub them together for so long, causing brief rope burn. 
Back and forth, sideways and down-ways...you get the idea. I was finally 
able to twist one hand free, then loosened the other. It was then that 
everything changed.

Opening my long-clasped hand, I found a small pocketknife resting in my 
palm. I stared at it longer than necessary, wondering how it had gotten 
there. It then dawned on me that Jane had placed it there as she kissed 
me&#151;subtle, quiet, making sure the action went unseen. I clutched the 
small knife close to my heart, feeling guilty for everything I had done. 
The woman, strange as she was, had been genuine all along.

But I still didn&#39;t trust her.

Quickly, I used the small blade to cut through the ropes that kept my 
legs tied to the chair, then loosened out of the rest. I rose out of my 
chair, wobbly for awhile, and felt weak from sitting so much. Even 
though I was strapped for time, I forced myself to stretch my limbs 
until they regained their strength&#151;and then, nervously, I searched my 
pockets, looking for my special coin. My heart jumped as I touched it; 
the object was practically begging me to use it, and I knew I would need 
its powers to get me out of that place. But first, something to eat. 
Jane had left that tray of food as well, and I was too hungry to pass it 
up.

I slowly began to creep out of the room, wary of anything that might&#39;ve 
been watching me. I slipped out the door and found myself in a hallway. 
Deciding to risk it, I raised my hand slightly and imbibed the powers of 
my coin on a small scale. I had a feeling I would need to head right to 
find the safest route, so I quickly sprinted in that direction. I passed 
no guard as I made my way down the hall, and then dove into a nearby 
door. Not willing to argue with fate, I complied and regretted it two 
minutes later. For the moment, though, I was in the clear.

After taking a breath, I looked around and wondered why fortune had 
indicated for me to come in here (I would find out later). As I stood 
wondering, I felt the presence of another, one whose foul aura of deceit 
I had sensed many times before. I turned around to the door and snarled 
like a cornered wolf as I saw Darred the Numb-Mind grinning back at me.

&quot;Ello&#39;, luv, we meet again!&quot; he growled playfully. &quot;You&#39;re more 
resourceful than I thought, Aura. Getting out of those binds and coming 
all the way here...that&#39;s quite impressive. Indeed, you&#39;re no normal 
girl, which is why I likes you.&quot;

&quot;Spare me,&quot; I spat. &quot;If you take so much as one step, I&#39;ll kill you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think you will,&quot; he said quietly, using the tone of voice 
he reserved for hypnosis. I found myself having the greatest desire to 
spare his life suddenly as he walked up to me. &quot;In fact,&quot; he continued 
melodiously, &quot;you&#39;ll do just the opposite. I think this room is far 
enough from prying eyes that I can go about a pleasurable business. Now, 
Aura...you will have an overwhelming desire to please me.&quot;

I knew in my heart that I wanted anything but that, but everything 
within me said otherwise. Darred spoke again, emphasizing how I would 
ache to make him happy, how I would suffer so that his every need was 
met, and how much I would burn just to hold him, to kiss him, to love 
him forever. I could not fight him off, no matter how hard I tried.

&quot;Now, I want you to do something special for me,&quot; he said quietly, 
making sure for the second time that the door was locked. &quot;Now that you 
desire me like none other, I&#39;d like for you to demonstrate this desire. 
Off with your shirt.&quot; My face turned red, perhaps from both anger and 
embarrassment, but I slowly obeyed his order. My top came off and fell 
to the floor, and a look of pleasure flashed in his eyes.

&quot;Ah, good. You&#39;re a sight for sore eyes, Aura. Now...your skirt. Off 
with it as well.&quot; I felt helpless as I slipped off that which kept my 
legs covered, and stood quivering and nearly naked in front of him, all 
my clothes in a pile. Inwardly, I wanted to crush his throat, but...

&quot;Ah...absolutely magnificent...&quot; Darred sighed airily, and approached me 
with every intention of making me his. I wanted to kill him, but a 
strange part of me wanted to please him. I would have been shamed and 
humiliated deeply if a burst of blood and a scream hadn&#39;t woken me up 
from my state.

Both the blood and the scream were Darred&#39;s; he had been slashed in the 
back while he was focused on me. As my eyes became less hazy, I saw that 
the door had been broken apart, and Jane&#151;in the guise of a full-blooded 
werewolf&#151;had been the one to rescue me. ...Yes, I&#39;m sure most of you all 
saw that coming, but bear with me. Darred was wounded, but that only 
made him angrier as he turned to glare at my savior.

&quot;Jane!!! You bitch!! How could you betray us like that?!&quot;

&quot;Easy, all I had to do was break down the door and give you a massage.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mean that, you pompous retard! I mean...ahh, you traitor! How 
dare you do this! Just for that, I&#39;ll see you die meself! Pick up that 
knife over there!&quot; Jane snarled at him, but slowly the evil power of 
Darred&#39;s numbing effect took control over her sense of judgment. The 
lycanthrope struggled to fight it, but in the end he proved too 
powerful. Jane lurched towards a small, discarded blade in the corner, 
and bent down with rusty joints to pick it up.

&quot;Now stand up, you dog, and plunge that thing into your body until you 
die!&quot; I stared in shock as Jane stood up, and raised the blade high for 
a finishing blow. My body found its strength again, and with a fierce 
tackle, I smashed myself into Darred, instantly breaking his mind 
control. Both of us fell to the floor in a heap and struggled with each 
other violently as Jane slowly came to.

Darred was much stronger than I thought he would be, and he overpowered 
me several times. The fiend pinned me down once and ran his tongue along 
my face, but my legs were far from restrained and so I kicked at him 
with everything I had. Darred fell away as Jane yanked at him, and 
turned his aggression towards her. I stood up as quickly as I could, and 
grabbed the evil man by the neck as he wrestled with my savior. I 
wrapped my fingers around his throat and squeezed as hard as I could, 
still flushed from my lack of clothing and the recent struggle. Jane 
took some time to recover and focused her glare on Darred, but I kept 
her away with my words.

&quot;No! This one is mine! I owe him for humiliating me!&quot; She understood, 
and allowed me to wrestle with the man. He struggled, trying desperately 
to keep his windpipe from smothering under my claw grip. He lurched and 
wriggled like a stubborn carp in my hands; I had to fight just to keep 
him still. It was then that I felt the dreadful foul aura of his, the 
one he used to bend people&#39;s minds.

&quot;You......will......release me...&quot; he rasped. Under any other 
circumstances, I would have been swayed, but this time, I would not 
allow myself to simply comply. I summoned up the full force of my skill, 
countering any effect he had with its superior power.

&quot;No... I... will... not!!&quot;

&quot;Aura!&quot; he wheezed, feeling my overwhelming power take control. 
&quot;You...no!!&quot; With a powerful twist, I used every shred of determination 
and anger to crush his throat, and didn&#39;t let go until I felt his breath 
die and his pulse fade to nothing. I released the man to the floor, 
suddenly realizing what I had done.

Yes, that&#39;s right. I killed him.

&quot;Oh, God... Almighty God in Heaven, what have I done...&quot; I trembled 
uncontrollably and stared at my hands as the body of my enemy rested 
motionless on the floor. I couldn&#39;t believe that I could ever have the 
power to actually kill anyone, even in self-defense! I had followed 
people into battle and seen many deaths before, but never...not even 
once...was one of those deaths directly caused by me. It was a scary 
feeling&#151;the feeling that, after nearly fifteen years of &quot;clean&quot; living, 
you find that you have the potential to murder after all.

Finally, I felt a hand touch my shoulder. It was Jane. She only gave me 
a look, but I knew from that look that what I did was not a crime, nor 
was it evil. It had come down to the lives of two people, and I had been 
willing to fight in order to preserve those lives. I understood the true 
nature of war in those few seconds&#151;the desire to fight even during 
frightening times, for the sake of that which is most beloved&#151;and though 
I shuddered, I also stood.

&quot;Now do you trust me?&quot; she asked solemnly. I glanced at her again, 
taking on her new image. As a woman, she had appeared wolfish, but as a 
wolf, she looked somewhat human. There was a beauty beneath the fur, 
tail, ears, and fangs that I could see, one that had been made strong by 
outlasting many difficult obstacles. I slowly nodded my head.

&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied with a whisper, &quot;I do. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. Well, I never thought I&#39;d say this, but you&#39;d better get 
dressed. We can&#39;t have you escaping this mudhole in your underwear.&quot; I 
blushed and smiled shyly as I realized I was still mostly undressed, and 
took a few embarrassed moments to put my clothes on. Curse that 
Darred...but I had repaid his evil, so I didn&#39;t have to think about 
cursing him.

&quot;What do we do now?&quot; I asked once I was presentable. Jane held her elbow 
up with one hand and propped the other beneath her chin, giving me a coy 
look.

&quot;Well, well, now it&#39;s &#145;we&#39;? You really do trust me, don&#39;t you Aura?&quot;

&quot;It seems I have no choice,&quot; I answered. &quot;You&#39;ve saved my life enough 
times for me to trust you. I...I am grateful for all of them. Thank 
you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she replied. &quot;Well, let&#39;s get out of here. I know the 
quickest way; we should have you back under the sun in a few minutes.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; I followed her out of the room, realizing why fortune had 
asked me to enter there. I also ascertained that it had indeed been Jane 
who placed that small pocketknife in my hand; the woman really was 
saving me from that awful place. I felt guilty for being so mean to her 
before...but now that I look back on it all, I guess I can understand 
why I did it.

We raced through several hallways and doors, keeping out of sight for 
the most part. Luck was with us, of course, and with Jane leading us the 
right way, we came quite a good distance before we were stopped. The 
commotion had been kept quiet throughout our escape, but somebody was 
bound to notice Darred&#39;s lack of existence. We ran into a small mob of 
guards on our way out; most of them had guns, and I assumed one of them 
had been the one who watched over me briefly.

&quot;Stop right there!&quot; A shot came out and whizzed right past us. These 
people weren&#39;t fooling around and they weren&#39;t sticking around for 
formalities. Jane quickly jerked me aside, and ran as fast as she knew 
how past the long corridors. I could barely keep up.

&quot;Wait, this is getting us nowhere!&quot; she said at last, exasperated. 
&quot;Climb on my back and ride!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no time! Just do it!&quot; I gave up arguing and did as she asked, 
and hung on tight as the faster woman sped up. I clutched on for dear 
life, pressing my whole body against her back as I hung on. Riding a 
werewolf that&#39;s running in full stride is an experience, I&#39;ll say, 
though one I wouldn&#39;t like to feel it again. We made it away from the 
group of guards, distancing ourselves from their destructive bullets and 
anger, and found ourselves closing in on a fiercely secure door.

&quot;Get off,&quot; she told me, so I jumped. Jane quickly broke the lock and 
chain that kept anyone from leaving, and kicked the steel door down with 
a mighty blow. She beckoned for me to follow, and without needing any 
more instruction, I entered into the world of light once more.

......

Pursuing them like a hawk would pursue an escaping rabbit, Yubami the 
Great-Bow protruded out of the door slightly, raising a much larger 
version of her crossbow. The destructive weapon was perfect for 
long-distance sniping, hence her name&#151;and she had it aimed at both Aura 
and Jane. The deadly ex-priestess would have impaled them both through 
the base of the neck if she hadn&#39;t been stopped.

&quot;No. Put it down. Let them go.&quot; Silently, she focused her cold gaze 
towards the old, wiry man behind her. The ballista fell, and she turned 
away from her prey. &quot;Let them believe they have escaped. We will not be 
the ones who kill them. Nature will do it for us.&quot; Yubami nodded, and 
followed Ezekiel the Seeker inside the base. The blast of arctic wind 
did not follow her.

......

Maybe...this wasn&#39;t such a good idea after all.

I do not know as much of the world&#39;s geography as I would like, and 
being that as it may, I had no idea where we had ended up. What I did 
know was that it was a frozen wasteland, covered in snow and bitterly 
cold winds. I saw immense, icy mountains standing off in the forbidden 
distance, and before us there was a great river covered with a glassy 
sheet of frost. In the far distance, we would soon discover, were pine 
trees, but little else in the ways of protection. My meager clothing 
barely kept my body from sinking into frostbite; I held myself and 
shivered horribly as my feet rose and plunged forward into some unknown 
freedom.

&quot;Do you know where we are?&quot; I managed, shouting over the blizzard. Jane, 
donned completely in the bristly fur of a werewolf, seemed unaffected by 
the cold.

&quot;Far to the north,&quot; she replied. &quot;I don&#39;t know my land that well.&quot;

&quot;Oh. That&#39;s comforting!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; she said. Jane noticed my frigid condition and drew me in 
close to her. &quot;Come here, Aura, you&#39;re freezing! You humans should know 
that being exposed to intense weather for so long can kill you!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like I had a choice!&quot; I shouted, fighting just to keep my 
voice from stuttering. Jane nodded.

&quot;Well, keep close. Let&#39;s head over there. I think I can smell pine 
trees. We can use that for some shelter.&quot;

&quot;Shelter?! From this?!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s better than being exposed. Come on, ride on my back, and be 
thankful I&#39;m equipped for cold weather!&quot; I was, many times over, and did 
as she asked. It was terrifying to blitz through all that snow and cold, 
but I suppose going through it quickly was better than trudging through 
it slowly. I tried to keep my skin covered up, little good that did, as 
I rode for the mile or so it took Jane to reach the grove.

We were blessed with fortune (again) to find that the clump of massive 
evergreen trees was so clustered together that the floor was clear of 
white frost. Jane was exhausted from running so much, and I didn&#39;t 
exactly feel refreshed either. I dismounted and huddled in the driest 
place I could find while she shook all the flakes off. It was still 
bitterly cold, but at least some of the snow and wind didn&#39;t affect us.

&quot;You okay? Your face is as blue as a berry.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll...be fine...&quot; I managed, though I knew I was anything but. Jane 
gave me a tender smile.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. We weren&#39;t out there long enough for you to get frostbitten, 
and I&#39;m rather comfortable, thanks for asking.&quot;

&quot;...Sorry,&quot; I managed with embarrassment. During all that time, it had 
occurred to me that I never thanked her for any of her help. I fixed 
that problem on the spot, and received the usual welcome and &quot;it was no 
big deal&quot; response. &quot;I can&#39;t say that a whole lot of people have saved 
my life in the past,&quot; I continued, trying to stay warm. &quot;Of course, I 
haven&#39;t exactly been in much danger, due to my power and all. But you&#39;ve 
been excellent.&quot; Jane smiled and chuckled humbly.

&quot;It was a pleasure. It&#39;s not every day I meet a beautiful, strong, 
intelligent, independent young woman, and it certainly isn&#39;t every day 
when I get to save her life.&quot; All right, I couldn&#39;t help blushing. You 
keep a relatively romance-free life for nearly fifteen years and you 
start craving admiration. So I was starting to like her, too. I was 
actually starting to like the idea of being warm a lot more, though.

&quot;It&#39;s cold,&quot; I said after a pause. &quot;And dark. Does the day always end so 
quickly up here?&quot;

&quot;Most likely,&quot; she replied, looking off into the creeping darkness. &quot;I 
heard from old man Ezekiel that the far north and south parts of the 
world see darkness more often because the way they&#39;re positioned on the 
planet. It was way too complicated for me.&quot;

&quot;Too complicated for me, too,&quot; I added wryly. Jane turned to me and 
grinned.

&quot;Naw! You&#39;re a smart lady!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m also a cold lady,&quot; I added with a shiver. Jane smiled sadly, and 
walked over to where I was huddled. She sat, and took me into her 
embrace. I was so frozen, I couldn&#39;t resist even if I wanted to. Oh, but 
heavens, that fur coat of hers made me feel warm!

&quot;I can help you there,&quot; she whispered&#151;quite shyly, I&#39;ll add. &quot;The cold 
doesn&#39;t bother me. You can...you know...hold onto me for warmth. I know 
it&#39;s not gonna be comfortable sleeping outdoors in this weather...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll fare,&quot; I said. She smiled, her face close to mine, and parted a 
few dark locks of hair that were about to get into my eyes. I turned red 
and looked away.

&quot;You&#39;re so pretty...&quot; she whispered. &quot;And you kiss good.&quot;

&quot;That makes me a little uncomfortable,&quot; I told her. She nodded.

&quot;All right. I&#39;m sorry for that. It seemed like the best way to...help 
you. I learned it from this really handsome spy named Ash. He sorta 
taught it to me.&quot;

&quot;...Lucky Jane,&quot; I added with a shy smile. She returned it and nodded. I 
then noticed something that I hadn&#39;t seen before. Being so close to her, 
I could smell blood and metal, and my hand felt something trickle into 
it. I grimaced and shirked back as I saw I had touched a spot of blood.

&quot;Ugh! What&#39;s this! Jane! Oh, goodness! You&#39;re bleeding! You&#39;re hurt!&quot;

&quot;Where?&quot; The woman combed through her short fur, and noticed that a 
small gash in her oblique had been made. She shrugged nonchalantly. &quot;Oh, 
that. I probably took a hit while we were escaping. Don&#39;t worry about 
it.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s a wound from a gun!&quot; I hissed sharply. She shrugged again.

&quot;Yeah, I know. I&#39;ve been hit by them before. They&#39;re like mosquito bites 
to me; I&#39;m not too affected.&quot; Seeing my puzzled and shocked face, she 
laughed and clarified. &quot;I&#39;m a werewolf, remember! Bullets don&#39;t hurt me! 
I&#39;m only weak against one thing, and it&#39;s in sharp demand wherever you 
look! Don&#39;t worry about it! It&#39;ll heal up soon!&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; I said darkly. She grinned.

&quot;Of course! I&#39;ve had much worse than this, although I am flattered that 
you care enough for me to be concerned.&quot; I flustered again, and actually 
stammered.

&quot;Uh, well, um...you know...it&#39;s the least I could do...&quot; Jane grinned 
sweetly, and brushed the hair from my forehead again.

&quot;You&#39;re sweet. Well...try and get some sleep. Stay as close to me as you 
can. When we wake up, I&#39;m afraid you may be a bit too toasty.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind that,&quot; I admitted, and already I was feeling warm. Jane 
and I shared a smile, and together we nestled into a bed of pine 
needles, readying ourselves for a short, rough, cold nap. It was a 
dreamless five or six hours... one that I found myself scared into 
liking.

I did indeed wake up feeling unusually warm. I was flushed to find 
Jane&#39;s wolfish face close to mine, her breath pouring onto my neck. It 
was hot and humid, something I hadn&#39;t felt since I left the island 
several days ago... but it was a strange, comforting feeling. She was 
beautiful, even as this creature. I struggled to release myself from her 
&quot;protective&quot; hug and stood, stretching my limbs. The weather had gotten 
warmer since apparently, during our rest, the fierce storm of ice died 
down. I looked down at my traveling companion and smiled. She squirmed, 
and clutched at the invisible air. I chuckled and nudged her awake.

&quot;Hey. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s time we got moving? I&#39;m feeling refreshed.&quot;

&quot;Ugh... that&#39;s because you didn&#39;t have to run so far...and you don&#39;t 
have a bullet in your body.&quot;

&quot;I thought you said you could heal fast.&quot;

&quot;...Shuddup.&quot; I giggled and helped her to her feet.

&quot;Get...up, lazybones!&quot; Jane groaned and stood to her feet&#151;erm, paws. She 
seemed okay&#151;actually better than before&#151;and without any delay we set 
off. Unfortunately, we were both hungry, and even though snow can 
provide adequate supplies of water, it&#39;s no substitution for a hot meal 
(or even a cold one!). I thought we were doomed, being out there in the 
middle of nowhere, having no clue where to go even just to escape, but 
once again Jane saved my life. She stuck her fuzzy snout in the air, 
sniffled, and marched ahead of me.

&quot;It&#39;s food or I&#39;m a goat,&quot; she murmured. It took us a few cold minutes 
to get there, and once in awhile we had to rest, usually stopping if the 
winds died down. Eventually we made it to the outskirts of a small 
village nestled in the wasteland, bright and homey against the backdrop 
of white. Jane let out a shiver as she stared at the place.

&quot;Curse this transformation of mine,&quot; she said. Looking at me, the woman 
explained, &quot;I go from woman to wolf every month, around the first full 
moon. Just one of the many &#145;side effects&#39; of this curse of mine. If I 
didn&#39;t look like this, we could go in there and be safe, but...well, 
when was the last time that people held any sympathy to werewolves?&quot; I 
admitted she had a point, but then suggested she go in disguise. I 
offered her part of my clothes, and together with her own, she was able 
to construct a kind of hood that shielded her face. It was then, very 
carefully, we proceeded into the town.

I knew we couldn&#39;t stay long, so we headed to the nearest hotel (but 
they called it quaintly an inn). All the way I feared the gaze of 
others&#151;not for me, but for Jane. I doubted the extra covering would give 
her much protection, but we were able to make it to the inn without 
incident. I briefly wondered how we&#39;d pay, but Jane had some money. Once 
we were in our room, we both got to warm up from the cold, but I had to 
go out again for groceries. I wish I hadn&#39;t done that. An uprising of 
violence occurred while I was out, and it seemed focused on the inn we 
were staying at. I dropped my bags and rushed there as quickly as I 
could, fearing the worst.

Before I knew it, Jane was diving through the second-story window of the 
inn. She rolled in the ground and limped a few feet, covered in glass. A 
mob chased after her, screaming for the blood of the werewolf they had 
just discovered, firing rounds of ammunition I hoped weren&#39;t silver. I 
grabbed my friend and dove down to pick up one sack of groceries and 
barely made my way out of there. We ran and ran and ran, until Jane 
collapsed, so we hid in a dark corner and waited for the mob to pass. 
Once things were calm, I got a good look at my comrade and could tell 
from the bleeding that she had been hit, hard.

&quot;Silver bullets,&quot; she hissed. &quot;Those stupid humans thought of 
everything! They must&#39;ve...been superstitious!&quot;

&quot;Listen, we can still make it,&quot; I told her with determination. &quot;The 
weather&#39;s died down and I&#39;m strong enough to carry you. Just hang on, 
Jane. Hang on, and don&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Oh, what I wouldn&#39;t give to hear that again...&quot; she murmured groggily. 
My pulse quickened as I realized just how little time she had left. I 
had to devote more and more of my strength to carrying her as we left 
the village.

&quot;Hang on, Jane,&quot; I whispered, fulfilling her request. &quot;Please, don&#39;t 
leave. Don&#39;t you even think about it. It would hurt me to have you...go 
like that.&quot;

&quot;What a...flattering thing to say,&quot; whispered the lycanthrope airily. 
She and I both stumbled, and I had to crawl over and hoist her up with 
all my strength. The wound had not closed and she was losing blood&#151;the 
snow was turning redder and redder&#151;and Jane&#39;s nonsensical babbling 
became quieter and less frequent. I ended up carrying her with my arms 
instead of just supporting her. She smiled quietly and hooked her paw 
around my neck.

&quot;I thank you,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I&#39;ve got enough strength to thank you. 
I&#39;m glad...you have a good enough heart...to help someone who was your 
enemy two days ago.&quot;

&quot;You were never my enemy, Jane,&quot; I huffed. &quot;I was just...mistrusting. I 
was a monster, really.&quot;

&quot;No, I...can&#39;t blame you,&quot; she replied weakly. &quot;It&#39;s because you don&#39;t 
trust the people I worked with...and you&#39;ve been conditioned to not 
believe in anything that seems too good to be true. A woman on the 
inside wanting to help a potentially valuable hostage? It&#39;d be ludicrous 
in any other situation.&quot;

&quot;But not in ours,&quot; I added, smiling gently. She squeezed her eyes shut 
in a sweet smile, and nuzzled my neck weakly.

&quot;No. Not ours. ...Aura.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; I managed.

&quot;......I think I love you. Yes. I know it now. To have such compassion 
for a person to be willing to risk one&#39;s life...and then to throw it 
into the pot for permanent safekeeping just so they can live a bit 
longer, without shame and shackles to keep them... That is pure love. 
And...to have that person repay every debt with acts of love and 
kindness...their own acts...... Aura...&quot;

&quot;Yes, Jane...&quot; I whispered. I didn&#39;t know whether I was going to lose 
her or not. The way she was talking, I felt scared. That sort of thing 
usually isn&#39;t said until...last. I had a sudden rush of emotions coming 
at me, some so strong that I could ignore the cold. I suddenly felt like 
desperately holding onto the woman who had been a stranger and an enemy, 
to not let her go, not even into pain and death. I realized, though it 
might seem foolish now, that I would have done anything to ease that 
agony she had&#151;both in her body and in her heart. I wanted to do this 
because...I knew I would lose her, and...Jane had performed many 
sacrifices for my own well-being.

I loved her, but I was forced to let her go. She had enough strength to 
breathe and speak. The silver shards were poisoning her beyond my help.

&quot;Aura...I&#39;m...sorry...to have burdened you...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t speak,&quot; I whispered, caressing her furry face with my hand. The 
cold meant nothing to me now. Jane closed her eyes and wept.

&quot;I wish...I could live for a few more years...so you and I...could have 
a proper relationship. I would have liked to have known you more 
completely...in that time...&quot;

&quot;Yes...myself as well. I...wanted to know more about the beautiful woman 
who saved my life and......died for me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not dead yet,&quot; she murmured hazily. I smiled sadly, and she spoke 
again. &quot;Aura...I have two last things I want to tell you. First, look to 
those mountains, over there.&quot; She pointed clumsily, and I saw the peaks. 
They looked like prongs on a fork. &quot;You are supposed to go there if you 
want to escape. Pass through their valley and you&#39;ll see a port town. 
You&#39;ll find passage back south, across the seas. I...overheard that 
route...from those that have taken it. It&#39;s the only way out that I know 
of.&quot;

&quot;I...I see.&quot; What else could I say? All I could do was understand. 
&quot;Thank you. Are there boats there?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she managed weakly, squirming in pain. I clutched her 
paw and hung on as her pulse slowed. Damnation, I was powerless.

&quot;What&#39;s the other thing you wanted to say?&quot; I whispered. She glowed with 
happiness.

&quot;I...wish that you would return my kiss...even if it makes you 
uncomfortable. It&#39;s my only request of you.&quot; I looked down at her, 
helpless and quickly slipping, and sighed.

&quot;Right now, it does not make me uncomfortable.&quot;

It did not.

&quot;Thank you...Aura...&quot; Jane smiled at me again, and in that frozen middle 
of nowhere, I lost a good friend. Excuse me for a moment, please. This 
is still a little traumatic, even now. I&#39;ll be all right. I just need 
some time to pause. Could I have some water, please? ...Thank you.

After a long moment of frozen silence, I decided to bury my friend. It 
was the least I could do after everything she did for me. I wanted to 
mark her burial site, but the only thing I had with me were my clothes. 
I opted for a shred of my skirt, and stuck a piece in the snow using the 
pocketknife she had slipped me earlier. Then, I set out for the 
mountains, now weighed down by another death.

I will now abbreviate my tale by saying that, through great force of 
will and persistence, I braved the frozen elements alone and reached the 
mountains without having my limbs frozen off. The peaks provided some 
protection from the cold, and led me almost directly towards a second 
small town. I found out that few boats were harbored there&#151;few of 
anything, really&#151;but I could get a warm room and some food. I rested 
there a day and bought fare for a ride south the next.

The journey was long and chilling. I stayed mostly in my room, 
reflecting on what had happened. I had nearly died enough times to be 
considered part-cat, but all those times I had been saved one way or 
another. Yet...I had been powerless to help the one who saved me the 
most, the one I...regret having known so briefly. Jane was right; I wish 
I had known her better. I am sure I would have liked her more and more 
as time went on. That ride across the ocean would&#39;ve been more bearable, 
at least. Perhaps it was for the best, though.

When at long last we reached warm waters, the seas became wild and out 
of control. Hardened sailors, who had claimed to have seen the worst, 
scrambled to keep their boat from toppling over. I felt like I had been 
tossed into a cyclone, and struggled to merely keep myself from being 
flown in all directions. The ship became capsized in no time, and soon 
all hands were ordered to abandon ship. There were few life rafts to 
step up into (yes, quite fierce sailors, these were), and I got knocked 
out of mine by a fierce wave. When I surfaced from the deep, I couldn&#39;t 
find any of the rafts or even the sinking ship. I was alone in the 
ocean, miles from anywhere.

I swam for it anyway. Living in a bustling port town most of my life 
gave me good reason to learn how to swim. I&#39;m certainly no mermaid, but 
I could hold my head above water long enough. I decided not to fight the 
storm temporarily, and hung onto a piece of timber that had floated my 
way until it calmed. Once the seas became less rough, I paddled on 
south, following the stars until my small life raft gave way. I was 
forced to use all my strength to swim the rest of the way, wherever I 
was going.

Needless to say, things seemed hopeless once I began to feel fatigue. I 
certainly couldn&#39;t swim for very long, least of all in an aimless 
direction. I had no idea how far along I was or even if I had made any 
progress at all. I felt that once again, death would arrive to extend 
its skeletal hand&#151;and this time fortune would not be with me. I swam 
until my legs and arms grew numb, and soon my muscles and even my 
willpower failed me. I started to sink and began to weep as I realized I 
had come through so much only to fail now.

It was not to be my end. After sinking for a short time, I felt a sandy 
surface beneath me. Daring to hope I had reached land, I surfaced and 
took in the sweet sea air. I could hear waves crashing against a beach! 
I swam as fast and as furiously as I could, probably destroying my 
muscles in the process. I finally felt the wet ground beneath me after a 
few minutes, and crawled the rest of the way to land. I distanced myself 
from the waves and collapsed on the beach, exhausted beyond my own 
comprehension. I slept until the burning sun woke me up.

I woke up alive, though I felt terrible. I had seaweed and sand all 
over, and my clothes were hopelessly clogged with water. I managed to 
crawl to my feet, but stumbled once I discovered the energy I spent 
swimming there still had not recovered. I didn&#39;t want to lie on the sand 
exposed like that, no matter how warm it was, so I found some shade and 
tried to relax. I was starving and parched, but I knew I could survive 
until I found a source of refreshment. A few hours later, with my hunger 
overcoming my weak limbs, I stood and trudged past the beach.

&quot;As luck would have it,&quot; sighed Aura, &quot;I had stumbled across this 
continent after all. Surely, the creator of this world was watching out 
for me, and had some other plan for me instead of a death in the ocean, 
or anywhere else. I wandered through most of the land nearly on the 
brink of hopelessness, but once I saw the glint of MERCS headquarters 
and the gates guarded by Joanna, I knew I was safe. And the rest... is 
history.&quot;

.........

The burden that Aura had been carrying seemed to have lifted over the 
course of the next day. Several people apologized for their earlier 
insensitivity, but there was no need: their reaction was reasonable. 
Eventually things crawled back to being &quot;normal&quot;, although Kailin still 
hated her powers and poor Joanna had not said a word about her feelings 
to Aura. Julie&#39;s ecstatic behavior was accepted by Kris, who devoted 
herself to teaching the younger girl all the different aspects of love 
(even though she herself was confused by them), and Kohona had even more 
questions to ask her mother, who didn&#39;t know how to explain this new 
development.

The day after Aura returned, it was decided that a celebration was in 
order, and while decorations were strung up, food was cooked, and a 
loose schedule was made, the party was soon put off to the side (and 
much later, it was forgotten entirely). During the process of setting 
things up, a sharp knock came at the door and no receptionist was there 
to answer it. Sally was the first to volunteer, so she excused herself 
and saw to the new guest. On the other side of the door was an 
eerie-looking man, a smile perpetually plastered on his face and a hat 
over his head. His lips broadened into what might&#39;ve been actual 
happiness as he greeted the young lady.

&quot;May I...help you?&quot; she said.

&quot;I would appreciate it. I have come here to...visit some old 
acquaintances, and to check up on a partner of mine. Would you tell Dr. 
Yohko Kamaguchi of my arrival?&quot;

&quot;All right. And your name?&quot; His eyes flashed with color.

&quot;Just say...Mr. White has come calling. And he has some information that 
everybody will benefit from.&quot;
