<h1>Project Angelus (part 2 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>      Abby immediately noticed Sakura&#39;s state of disarray the next morning. The angel had 
been reliving the night&#39;s events over and over... How could Eveon have such an ability and 
how could she have not noticed sooner? It was possible that no fiend had ever visited the 
town and the girl had lived a virtually sheltered magical life until recently...

      Could Sakura&#39;s constant presence have bled some seeing power into Eveon...? But then 
why not Tycara or Abby? The sight for humans, demons and angels was extremely rare... but 
it was often isolated and... genetic...

      &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Abby&#39;s question brought her out of her musings.

      &quot;I... a fiend... a very nasty demon was here last night...&quot;

      Abby frowned. &quot;Ugh. Did you kill it?&quot;

      Sakura shook her head. &quot;No... it&#39;s just... his master wanted to see me, but I don&#39;t 
know who it was or why... and... Eveon could see him.&quot;

      &quot;What&#39;s so weird about that?&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s impossible to see a fiend unless you&#39;re a fiend yourself or you had a job... 
like mine...&quot;

      Her blonde lover started to catch on as she scrambled eggs for breakfast. &quot;You mean, 
Eveon shouldn&#39;t have been able to do that?&quot;

      Sakura shook her head, seated on a stool by the counter. &quot;No... unless... Abby. Have 
you ever... seen ghosts... or...?&quot;

      The young mother laughed immediately. &quot;God no. I&#39;ve never had any supernatural 
moments or seen stuff. Eveon&#39;s never really had it either. She had an imaginary friend when 
she was young and Terry-&quot;

      Abby stopped. &quot;Terry... used to play with Eveon and her imaginary friend all the 
time...&quot; She started to trail off, deep in thought. &quot;It&#39;s possible that she got it from 
him, then. I mean, Terry used to stare off into space all the time and tell about these 
great ghostly encounters he had.&quot;

      She turned to look at Sakura. &quot;He said he often just ignored it since it happened so 
much. I think that&#39;s... how he knew he was going to die...&quot; She put the eggs onto a plate. 
&quot;The week before the accident, he was in a frenzy. He double checked his life insurance, 
funds, stocks, everything. I thought he was insane, but he just wanted us to be safe.&quot;

      Sakura began to idly chew on her fingernail. &quot;That would... make sense... if he could 
see things, that Eveon would inherit it...&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t see what the big deal is. I mean, if people have this special sight, 
wouldn&#39;t more have it due to having children with it?&quot;

      Sakura shook her head and poked idly at the eggs with a fork. &quot;No... most people with 
the sight are trained as exorcists early on because it suits the job... Krystal and Josh 
don&#39;t have it, so it... isn&#39;t that dire... but... most people with the sight... don&#39;t last 
long.&quot;

      Abby was silent.

      &quot;If people with the sight let a fiend know they can see... Terry died out of 
happenstance, so maybe he was lucky. But...&quot; Sakura looked down at her plate. &quot;Fiends 
immediately eliminate those who can see.&quot;

      Abby was shocked. &quot;What? You mean someone is going to try and kill Eveon...?&quot;

      Sakura shook her head. &quot;No... fiends are... they&#39;re a dying race of demon, so... they 
like to convert those with the sight. Eveon is in a different kind of danger...&quot;

      Just then, Eveon and Tycara came downstairs to see their mothers looking worried. 
Eveon let out a long sigh. &quot;Is this about that weird guy from last night?&quot;

      Abby only nodded solemnly. &quot;Yeah... apparently he might kidnap you because you can 
see him.&quot;

      Eveon frowned. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me this is going to become another magical adventure...?&quot;

      &quot;Not if we can help it,&quot; Abby said. &quot;Actually, I have a foolproof plan! Eveon, when 
Mina collars you, make sure she puts a tracking device in it so we can find you when you&#39;re 
kidnapped!&quot;

      Abby was lucky enough to escape from the kitchen before Eveon could throw the stool 
at her. 

***** 

      &quot;I&#39;m a failure...&quot; Isaka groaned out.

      &quot;No, no, it&#39;s fine,&quot; Krystal said gently. The demon was curled up on the couch, her 
head in Krystal&#39;s lap. The exorcist was trying to assure her by stroking her head. Her 
lover, however, was still depressed at earlier events.

      &quot;I... I&#39;m just not good at this at all!&quot;

      &quot;Isaka, just because you can&#39;t crack open an egg doesn&#39;t make you a failure.&quot;

      Isaka suddenly sat up and looked at her girlfriend. &quot;But if I can&#39;t even crack open 
an egg, how am I supposed to help you make a cake for Eveon and Tycara?&quot;

      Krystal just hugged her close. &quot;You can... you can just read the recipe directions 
then.&quot;

      Isaka pouted, but snuggled up closer. &quot;...but what if I read the wrong thing?&quot;

      Krystal just patted her head, thinking on what had just transpired. They decided that 
instead of getting a gift, they would make a nice cake. Today, they were going to practice 
together. However, the blonde had greatly underestimated Isaka&#39;s lack of cooking expertise. 
First try, she wanted Isaka to mix all the ingredients together with the hand mixer... 
unfortunately, Isaka didn&#39;t realize that she had to have the mixer in the bowl before 
starting or-

      Well, they spent a long time cleaning the kitchen. The second try, Krystal wanted 
Isaka to measure the dry ingredients... but the demon didn&#39;t know the difference between a 
teaspoon, a tablespoon or even a cup. Thus, they had to throw away a lot of batter.

      Finally, Isaka had been demoted to cracking open the eggs and just putting them in 
the bowl. Krystal didn&#39;t even want her to separate the yolks from the egg white - she 
figured it would be easier to take the whole egg. Of course, it took all of one egg and a 
squeeze for them to have to clean the kitchen again.

      &quot;Maybe...&quot; Krystal said, already imagining Isaka reading something wrong in the 
directions, &quot;Maybe I will make the cake and you can be the taste tester for the cake 
batter?&quot;

      The demon just snuggled up closer to her girlfriend. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I suck at this...&quot;

      It always amused Krystal how in times of trouble or distress, Isaka would go from 
demonic seductress to scared little child. Odd, but she didn&#39;t mind one bit. &quot;It&#39;s okay - 
you&#39;re a good at a lot of other things.&quot;

      Isaka snorted as she pulled away. &quot;Like what? Sex? Sometimes I think that&#39;s about 
it...&quot;

      Krystal smiled and gave her a kiss. &quot;You&#39;re number one at making me happy.&quot;

      The demon&#39;s frown slowly turned into a smile. &quot;I sure hope so...&quot;

      It was then that Krystal heard the jingle of her cell phone and reached over to the 
coffee table to grab it. &quot;Hello?&quot; 

***** 

      Abby set the phone back in the cradle, looking at her daughter. &quot;Well, Eveon... after 
contacting our magical friends, it seems Krystal and Isaka will be here soon, Faye and Erin 
are already on their way while Tsuru and her little incestuous harem are looking into the 
surrounding area...&quot;

      &quot;And I&#39;m still trying to find stuff,&quot; Seth piped up, flipping through another old 
book as Eveon idly munched on her cereal.

      &quot;I really don&#39;t see why everyone is freaking out...&quot; Eveon mumbled.

      &quot;Ah, but would Mina be happy to find out her girlfriend got turned into a ferociously 
evil fiend?&quot; Seth asked.

      Eveon sighed. &quot;I&#39;m guessing we won&#39;t be able to go out on our date tonight, then.&quot;

      Abby laughed. &quot;Sorry to ruin your Saturday night. The two of you can just have fun 
over here. I don&#39;t want some weird ass demon showing up at Mina&#39;s house. Melanie and Matt 
might get mad at me...&quot; She trailed off, thinking about her strange friendship with the 
Lamets... why they still allowed Mina over was beyond her.

      Then again, even in high school, Melanie wasn&#39;t the brightest of all girls so-

      Sakura came down the stairs, trying to hide her frazzled state. The thought of 
anything happening to her family worried her. Everything was perfect now... Behind her, 
Tycara came down, beaming when she saw Seth.

      &quot;You&#39;re here already?&quot; The hybrid asked, immediately sitting down next to him.

      &quot;Yeah, I was already on my way to come see you, so...&quot; Seth returned to his book for 
a moment. &quot;I called up Josh and him and Bakra are going to try and see if anything is going 
on with fiends right now. Unfortunately, the sight doesn&#39;t run in Krystal&#39;s family, so 
they&#39;re probably going to have a long time.&quot;

      Eveon stared at her cereal. &quot;Is it really that special? And if normal people can&#39;t 
see fiends, why haven&#39;t they overthrown the world or whatever?&quot;

      Sakura spoke up. &quot;They&#39;re... invisible until they react violently... they possess the 
ability to hide themselves from prying eyes... but it only lasts so long as they don&#39;t lash 
out.&quot;

      &quot;And there are only about... a couple hundred of them world wide, if even,&quot; Seth 
added. &quot;They&#39;re nasty little suckers, but thankfully too small to do anything.&quot;

      Sakura finally settled on sitting down when Abby guided her to a chair. &quot;But...&quot; the 
angel murmured. &quot;If someone were to...&quot; She trailed off, her mind looking for answers she 
didn&#39;t have. The only possible explanation would be someone trying to control the fiends... 

***** 

      &quot;We... can&#39;t go out tonight?&quot; Eveon felt her heart sink a bit at Mina&#39;s words.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s my fault, but you can come over. I&#39;m sure you can stay the night, 
too!&quot; Eveon crossed her fingers and was relieved to hear her girlfriend agree. They were 
supposed to go out to the movies and then watch the stars, but...

      It seemed like her mothers didn&#39;t want her going outside at all. Eveon had just shut 
her cell phone after saying goodbye to Mina when there was a knock on her door. She had 
barely opened it when Faye came busting in.

      &quot;Eveon! You&#39;re going to be 16 soon!&quot; The red head exclaimed. Erin came in right after 
her and Posh-Posh slithered off her shoulders to take comfort on Eveon&#39;s bed.

      &quot;Sorry, she just gets really excited about birthdays since we don&#39;t age,&quot; Erin said.

      Eveon sat down on her bed, careful not to squish Posh-Posh. &quot;So, I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re 
here to protect me from nasty demons?&quot;

      Faye shrugged and motioned to the box in her hands. &quot;Yeah, but we figured we&#39;d bring 
you your presents a bit early.&quot;

      Erin gave her lover a dubious look, not knowing herself what was in Faye&#39;s mysterious 
box of goodies. The snake goddess instead held out a bracelet to Eveon. &quot;I didn&#39;t actually 
get a chance to pick out my gift yet, but this will keep you safe in case anything 
happens.&quot;

      To Eveon, it looked like a normal leather strap that fit comfortably. &quot;...so if I 
jump off a building would it protect me?&quot;

      Faye and Erin just laughed. &quot;No,&quot; the goddess of love said. &quot;If you jumped off a 
building Sakura and Tycara would dive to save you since they&#39;re the only ones who can fly.&quot;

      &quot;Hopefully there will be no reason to use it. It&#39;s like a tracking device,&quot; Erin 
said. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to work on my powers so I can be more useful, but this will help 
you out.&quot;

      Eveon nodded and suddenly found the mysterious box in her lap. It was made of flimsy 
cardboard and it took a little while for the blonde to realize that it was just a 
department store style clothing box. That was a good sign.

      She lifted off the top and heard a sigh of relief from Erin. There was a book sitting 
on top of some tissue paper... and it wasn&#39;t about sex...?

      &quot;I know you love to cook, so I went got a good one for a chef like you,&quot; Faye said. 
&quot;But there&#39;s more, I promise!&quot;

      &quot;Thanks, Faye,&quot; Eveon said. &quot;I&#39;m sure it will-&quot; She had started going through the 
tissue paper to find her other gift, but when she touched something that felt soft... Eveon 
lifted up the offending article before quickly, putting it back in the box. &quot;F-Faye!&quot;

      The Goddess of Love just laughed as Erin gave her a deadpan look. &quot;I thought you 
weren&#39;t going to get her anything inappropriate.&quot;

      Faye reached into the box and pulled out the lingerie set. It was a pair of lacy 
black undergarments with a matching bra. &quot;Oh, come on! She&#39;s going to be 16 next month and 
I figured that her and Mina are going to celebrate.&quot;

      She held up the panties to Erin. &quot;And this bold black color just brings out Eveon&#39;s 
best features while displaying to Mina that she isn&#39;t as na&iuml;ve as she initially seems. 
Plus, it&#39;s very dominant and sure to make their night very special.&quot;

      Erin let out a long sigh. &quot;Please... Faye... I baby-sat the two of them for a long 
time, so I&#39;d rather not think of them in skimpy outfits.&quot; 

      Faye grinned and handed Eveon the underwear. &quot;Make sure you try it on later. If you 
don&#39;t like the color or the design, I can go get you a different kind.&quot;

      Eveon just looked up at the ceiling in despair. &quot;This is so awkward... you went 
lingerie shopping for me?&quot;

      Faye scoffed at the girl&#39;s protest. &quot;Please, would you rather have me or your mothers 
do this?&quot;

      Eveon thought for a moment and tried to imagine them getting her intimate things in 
preparation for a night with Mina. &quot;...I guess you&#39;re right...&quot;

      Faye gave her a big hug. &quot;I&#39;m sure everything will work out-&quot; The goddess stopped and 
Erin saw the gears rolling in her mind. That meant big trouble. &quot;Mina&#39;s coming over tonight 
isn&#39;t she?&quot;

      Eveon nodded slowly, looked down at the panties in her hand and then back at Faye&#39;s 
smiling face. &quot;I... I will be sure to try them on tonight.&quot;

      Faye jumped with joy. &quot;Yay! Erin... it&#39;s time for us to prepare to distract her 
mothers so when Mina comes over, nothing interrupts them.&quot;

      Erin ruffled her hair and gave Eveon a sympathetic smile. &quot;Regardless of what Faye is 
advocating, do whatever is comfortable for you.&quot;

      The 15 year old nodded and with a sigh, placed the items back into the box.
