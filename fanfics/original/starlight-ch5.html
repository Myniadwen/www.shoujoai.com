    &quot;Thank you sensei. I&#39;m glad you chose me to go. It was very
educational.&quot; Tataku beamed at her course tutor.

    Misaniti smiled knowingly as she suppressed her slight blush. &quot;And
enjoyable by the looks of it. Well, I&#39;ll leave you to unpack. I just
needed to extend the academy&#39;s thanks.&quot;

    &quot;Umm, actually sir, I&#39;ve been invited to go to the Chaosis space
race. I&#39;ll be back for the start of term, but I thought I&#39;d like to
finish my holiday with a little time away.&quot; And with someone who&#39;d
been a great friend to her, and more. Someone who&#39;d left a small
folded note as she slept. Someone who said yes.

    &lt;Well well&gt;, Misaniti thought, &lt;it looks like she&#39;s finally
getting out a bit. Strange venue though.&gt; He gave her a reassuring
nod. &quot;Well, the rest of the month is yours. Enjoy yourself.&quot;

    &quot;Thank you sir. I&#39;ll try.&quot; It wouldn&#39;t be hard.

    Angelica leaned back against the landing strut of the Gal&#39;s Army
and sighed. &quot;Jeez, she is comin&#39; right? How long does it take to talk
to a couple of teachers?&quot;

    &quot;She&#39;s coming.&quot; Yae was certain of it.

    &quot;And what&#39;s got you so chipper this mornin&#39;?&quot; Angelica asked with
a distinct lack of subtlety. &quot;Not that I mind company without a black
cloud over it.&quot;

    Fate however, in the guise of Jei Tazenten, deigned to keep
Angelica&#39;s nose out of other people&#39;s business. &quot;Then you shouldn&#39;t
question it.&quot;

    Angelica conceded that point. &quot;At least *you&#39;re* talkin&#39; now. I
mean, you can tell us what the big deal is, you know. I ain&#39;t gonna
laugh if that&#39;s what you&#39;re worried about.&quot;

    &quot;We&#39;re going to the race. Isn&#39;t that enough?&quot;

    Angelica gave a sigh but wasn&#39;t going to give up. &quot;Trust me, we&#39;ll
have fun or we&#39;ll die tryin&#39;, which is petty possible, but where&#39;s the
fun without a bit of risk eh?&quot;

    Jei gave her a deadpan stare. &quot;That doesn&#39;t exactly enamour me to
the idea.&quot;

    &quot;We&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Sylvie said, halting the already well doomed
conversation. &quot;It won&#39;t take long to get there, and the course isn&#39;t
as dangerous as it could be. As long as we get the ship and make the
modifications in time there&#39;s nothing to worry about really.&quot;

    &quot;Exactly,&quot; Angelica crowed, &quot;and we&#39;ve got a damn good chance of
gettin&#39; back what we spend and a whole lot more. And even if we don&#39;t,
the way you get paid means we won&#39;t be out of pocket in the least.&quot;

    Angelica had been very pleasantly surprised at her cut for the
completion of the job. Jei hadn&#39;t been lying when she said she got
good work, and if her business sense was always as good as this
becoming a legitimate multimillionaire legally was indeed possible
with a bit of frugal living. It hadn&#39;t passed her notice that the
Moonlight had been without a bedroom. It wouldn&#39;t have surprised her
to know that Jei had just left a futon in one of the cargo bays.

    The sight of green hair over the storage crate heralded Tataku&#39;s
return, much to Angelica&#39;s relief. Docking bays were some of the less
interesting places to hang out as places went, and this one was no
exception. &quot;Hey Tataku, you ready?&quot;

    &quot;Yes, I&#39;ve made sure they know I&#39;ll be gone a bit longer. I&#39;ll get
my ship.&quot;

    Yae blinked. &quot;You have a ship? I thought you couldn&#39;t fly.&quot;

    It would take four days to get to the ship dealer Jei and Angelica
had in mind, and another week and a half to get to the race location.
She had been secretly looking forward to two weeks with Tataku before
their official &#39;date&#39;. There was so much she didn&#39;t know about her,
and she still didn&#39;t know how strongly she felt about the situation.
The Gal&#39;s Army only had one coupling dock, meaning one other ship
would have to be manned. Business reasons would mean that ship was
Tataku&#39;s. She wouldn&#39;t have time to find out whether this would work,
and no time to break off the date if they realised it wouldn&#39;t. And it
was two weeks with only radio contact with the shy girl. It just
didn&#39;t seem fair.

    Tataku noticed the encroaching despondency in Yae&#39;s face and
smiled reassuringly. &quot;No, I can&#39;t, I just kept failing the tests, but
it&#39;s an automatic. My father gave it to me when I came to the
academy.&quot;

    Angelica whistled appreciatively. &quot;Rich father. Well, let&#39;s see
it.&quot;

    &quot;No,&quot; Tataku corrected as she started to head off across the
immense bay, &quot;but Daddy works very hard for me. It was one of his old
ones.&quot;

    &quot;An automatic? So you&#39;ll still be flying with us right?&quot; Yae just
had to confirm it, and didn&#39;t realise how much she was giving away in
her voice. She also missed the curious looks Jei and Angelica gave
her. Sylvie just smiled happily.

    For her part Tataku gave a small amused smile and a nod. &quot;Yes.
I&#39;ll set it to take off and join formation with the Gal&#39;s Army.&quot; She
made it sound like the most obvious thing in the world. &quot;If you all
want to leave after the race then I can come back to school on my
own.&quot;

    Angelica gave a lopsided grin. &quot;Heh, nice thinkin&#39;. Never know
what might come up, and Crow looks like he&#39;s got plans of his own
anyway.&quot;

    She noticed Tataku&#39;s ship instantly. It was so typically Kai
Reithan it couldn&#39;t help but stand out, and she made it a point of
checking out the best of every possibility in her life. The ship was
pretty good, but she couldn&#39;t help but laugh.

    &quot;An Echohawk Six?! Heh heh, oh you have real class girl! It does
still fly right?&quot; She failed to suppress her giggles before she
started trying. &quot;And look at those mods!&quot;

    Tataku looked at her defensively. &quot;It&#39;s a good ship, and it works
like new. It&#39;s one of Daddy&#39;s favourites, and I like it.&quot;

    Angelica had the good taste to try and look apologetic through her
laughter. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m sorry girl. This is the classiest retro ship-work
I&#39;ve seen in ages, but really! I mean the fake vents on the engine
casings are just great!&quot; She finally dissolved into her elaborate
amusement, leaving the others to make their own judgements.

    The Echohawks were, in their day, the height of personal ship
design, and still a part of the era in Kai Reithan space history that
had the enthusiasm to come up with a name like the Echohawk. Of the
eight evolutions of the ship the six was both the best and the rarest,
being the safest, fastest and the only one not to include inertial
dampeners, so you could really feel the ride.

    Naturally like all AI controlled craft it let you fly manually if
you wanted to provided you had passed the test, and those few who
could afford to collect ships just loved it because it was a joy to
fly. It was also recent enough for the designers to realise that as
great as streamlining looked (at the time it was a big thing) it was
completely redundant in spacecraft, so the Echohawks made the best of
their chunky, angular design. Added to the Kai Reithan&#39;s love of
bright, bold colour it was quite a sight.

    Not only was the Six a good thirty years old now, the owner
obviously still loved the age. It had a gloriously garish orange and
brown two tone finish and the modifications were overdramatic to the
point of fond nostalgia for the time of the group&#39;s parents. Some
would have called it a retro nightmare, others a fantastic homage to
the age. Tataku&#39;s father called it Kookoo-chan&#39;s.

    &quot;Kookoo-chan&#39;s&#39;?&quot; Jei read off the yellow bordered silver
lettering on the ship&#39;s side, Angelica reading behind her.

    Tataku cringed inwardly, knowing what was coming. Angelica just
read the name again. &quot;What kind of name is that? Kookoo-chan? Oh,
don&#39;t tell me...&quot; She looked slowly over to Tataku, with a crafty and
very much amused smile.

    Tataku nodded. &quot;That&#39;s what Daddy calls me when he gets
emotional,&quot; she said in a very small voice, blushing brightly.

    Sylvie smiled while Angelica rolled around in fits of giggles.
&quot;Your father must think a lot of you.&quot;

    Tataku just nodded as Jei hauled a recovering Angelica back to her
feet.

    &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go. We&#39;ll see you back on board Tataku,&quot; Sylvie
said as she turned and the others followed. At the last minute a small
pang caught Tataku and she held out her hand.

    &quot;Yae.&quot;

    The woman in question turned. &quot;Huh?&quot;

    Tataku walked shyly up to her and bowed her head slightly. &quot;Thank
you.&quot;

    &quot;What for?&quot;

    &quot;... you know what for.&quot; The pair stood in silence for a second
before Tataku moved. Whether it was a surge of courage or impulsive
stupidity she didn&#39;t know, but she leaned forward and place a quick
light kiss on Yae&#39;s cheek. The two of them were blushing furiously as
she pulled back.

    &quot;ALRIGHT! GO FOR IT KOOKOO-CHAN!&quot; Angelica called as Jei and
Sylvie hauled her away, and Tataku dashed away into her ship,
embarrassment colouring her cheeks.

    Yae stood there looking into the ship and having just one little
guilty thought. &lt;I don&#39;t know how that just happened... I hope it
happens again.&gt;

***

    One day into the journey and Angelica was already bored.

    &quot;Haven&#39;t we even got any TV on board?&quot;

    Across the table Jei shook her head, not once taking her eyes of
her book. &quot;Yae abhors television.&quot;

    &quot;There&#39;s got to be something to do around here!&quot;

    Jei held out one of her other books, and Angelica looked at it
with distaste. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you of all people read this mush.&quot;

    &quot;Then don&#39;t read it.&quot;

    Angelica gave her and the book a cautious look, then opened the
novel.

    &quot;Don&#39;t damage the covers.&quot;

    &quot;Of course I won&#39;t!&quot; Angelica grumbled. &quot;Jeez it&#39;s only a damn
book.&quot;

    She turned the page and began to read.

***

    Sylvie watched with amusement as Angelica&#39;s eyes shined across the
vast array of ship. It was indeed a very extensive and fairly pricy
selection they had but she couldn&#39;t feel in the least bit melancholy
about the fact she would never fly one. Yae had been flooding her with
happy enthusiasm all day, no matter what she had been doing. She let
her smile widen just a little and hugged Andy that bit harder. It
seemed like her intuition had been correct.

    And now Angelica was on cloud nine too. It was a far cry for when
that had started out together, that was for certain. Even Jei was
beginning to open up again. &lt;God is in heaven, all is right in the
world.&gt;

    &lt;Okay,&gt; she admitted to herself, &lt;maybe it&#39;s horridly out of
context, but it feels right.&gt; She was in too good a mood to let
something like that matter right now. She would have to try and
convince Yae to bring out the old cartridge player again. Sylvie
really (and somewhat guiltily) enjoyed those old animations. It was
such a shame they were so hard to come by. &lt;Maybe it would help
Angelica relax once she finishes that book.&gt;

    Then again that might not be needed. The outlaw was currently
fawning over the bizarre looking ship she and Jei had settled on
during the trip there. It wasn&#39;t that it was particularly ugly, but
since racers were only really designed to move in one direction they
were the only ships still made that were even remotely streamlined.
While it didn&#39;t help the speed one bit it did help deflect any debris
that might otherwise punch through the thickly armoured hull, and at
those speeds you were bound to hit *something*.

    It really needed re-painting though. The lime green and yellow
look made her feel faintly ill. Still, it was their ship now, and she
had no right to tell them what it should look like.

    &quot;That&#39;s the one, huh? Expensive.&quot;

    She looked round in surprise to see Crow giving the ship an
appraising glance. &quot;Crow. Have you finished your work?&quot;

    &quot;No, there&#39;s always more you can plan. Only so much time you can
concentrate though.&quot;

    &quot;Oh.&quot; His tight lip about what he had been up to these past few
days made her nervous. It felt like he was hiding a secret from his
parents or something, because he knew he would get in trouble if they
found out. Coupled with the fact he didn&#39;t have to answer to them left
her mind creating all sorts of ideas as to what was going on, and some
of them were very plausible.

    &quot;Umm, Crow, I know it&#39;s not my place, but if you&#39;re planning
something dangerous you should tell Jei. She is still your employer.&quot;

    Crow looked down to her and gave a mild grin. &quot;I plan to.&quot; If he
ended up needing help then it was a good idea if at least one ally
knew where you were. &quot;Where are the other two?&quot;

    &quot;Making lunch. Will you be joining us this time?&quot;

    &quot;If there&#39;s enough.&quot;

    &quot;Sure there is,&quot; Angelica said as she marched over, followed by a
quietly pleased Jei who managed to look as stoic as ever. &quot;Glad to see
you out for some air at last. What&#39;ve you been up to?&quot;

    &quot;Just business,&quot; Crow replied evasively. &quot;That lime over there
yours now?&quot;

    Angelica grinned. &quot;Damn right. The mods&#39;ll take about two days to
finish, but we&#39;re gonna kick some real ass when we get it out of here.
&#39;Course the lug nut over there&#39;s just gonna keep it in auto &#39;till we
get Yae to try her out.&quot; She stuck her thumb over to Jei. &quot;Spoil
sport.&quot;

    &quot;We will allow Yae to familiarise herself with the interface and
controls during the trip. If we are entering the race we should be as
prepared as possible. If we don&#39;t race to win we might as well not
bother.&quot;

    As cold as she sounded Jei was very pleased with the new ship.
Once all the extraneous space was knocked out the cargo capacity would
be at least a third larger than her old ship, it was fast, and having
seen the controls she was confident she would be able to handle flying
it manually. The race would also be excellent publicity. She only
hoped it would attract the right people.

    &quot;Heh heh, that&#39;s the spirit,&quot; Angelica said, glad to finally have
what little enthusiasm Jei seemed to posses tied to the idea. &quot;Why you
want it white and grey though I&#39;ve got no idea.&quot;

    Sylvie had to mentally agree. It would end up a little stark. &quot;I
think we should be ready to eat soon if you&#39;ve got nothing else to
finish up now.&quot;

    &quot;Good, I&#39;m famished.&quot; Angelica took Jei&#39;s arm and started to drag
her off. &quot;Your supplies can wait, my stomach can&#39;t.&quot;

    &quot;Your stomach should learn its place,&quot; Jei stated bluntly, but she
didn&#39;t bother trying to escape. She was hungry too, and in no mood to
try and tussle with the hyperactive blonde.

    &quot;Nope. Tummy leads, we follow,&quot; &#39;Andy&#39; said from Sylvie&#39;s arms,
grabbing some of her own long hair. &quot;&#39;tis the rule of us blondies.&quot;

    &quot;Exactly!&quot; Angelica called and picked up her pace, very glad the
otherwise quiet girl had her panda. The quest for satisfaction could
not be withheld, culinary or otherwise.

    Crow just quirked an eyebrow and followed. He was getting quite
good at that eyebrow thing.

    As with most space stations that sold such things the ship
showroom shared its space with the landing dock for the ships not
docking outside. This meant they could design it as one gargantuan
section and the incoming ships would get to see the current stock as
they docked. It also meant purchases didn&#39;t need to be moved, and the
walk back to your own ship was a very short one.

    Sylvie&#39;s smile widened as they boarded the Gal&#39;s Army again. The
recent nervousness in Yae&#39;s mind was explained as the pair sat on the
settee in the lounge, Yae tentatively taking Tataku&#39;s hand in her own
as they chatted quietly. Tataku&#39;s cheeks coloured slightly, but the
moment couldn&#39;t last.

    &quot;Now isn&#39;t that cute!&quot;

    The pair sprang apart and turned to see them, Angelica ready to
burst into giggles again. Yae was glaring at her in uncomfortable
annoyance while Tataku had gone bight red from ears to toes, verified
by the fact she wasn&#39;t wearing her sandals. Sylvie and Jei came to the
rescue though as Jei took the opportunity to grab Angelica&#39;s arms and
Sylvie stuffed a pork bun into the offending outlaw&#39;s mouth.

    &quot;That was mean,&quot; she said with mock anger. &quot;Now leave them be
before poor Tataku implodes from embarrassment.&quot;

    Tataku gave her a grateful look as Crow hauled the temporarily
silenced woman into a seat. Luckily for the pair involved the rest of
the meal was taken up by the food, rather than their embarrassment and
Angelica had the new ship to take up her obligatory mealtime
conversation.

***

    The following ten days passed the same way most days of long space
travel do. That is to say, intensely dull with the occasional moment
of tension. Unusually though, the tension this time was not a breached
hull panel or running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. It was
Sylvie&#39;s old cartridge player.

    &quot;Oh man that hurts!&quot; Angelica exclaimed as the villain&#39;s head
cracked brutally against the mono-train handrail. &quot;I know, believe
me.&quot;

    &quot;Shh, just keep watching,&quot; Sylvie said, the large bowl of popcorn
in her hand jumping as the hero suddenly made his comeback.

    The quartet sat avidly glued to the screen as the combat unfolded
at a blistering pace. &lt;Who would have thought Sylvie would have been
into this sort of thing?&gt; Angelica grinned as the hero took a turn for
the worse.

    As it happened this was one of the more harsh films in Sylvie&#39;s
collection, but it was also one of the best. Angelica and Crow had
already asked to see the full series. If only she could find a copy of
episode #16. She knew it wasn&#39;t a great one, but it was such a shame
to miss it when she had found all the others.

    Jei just sat transfixed at the moving pictures in front of her.
She might have to add a copy of this to her collection if she could.
Animation wasn&#39;t a favourite of hers, but this was riveting and the
messages under the visuals pulled at her behind her stony facade.

    The current stretch of empty space was so seldom used all the
ships were left on their autopilots and Yae had decided that it was
about time she got to grips with the new racer&#39;s controls. Since Yae
wasn&#39;t around to dislike them, Sylvie had decided that getting her
video cartridges out was a good way to spend the time.

    Actually that was a bit hard on her. Yae just tended not to like
TV in general, and she had admitted that on occasion some of Sylvie&#39;s
shows were fairly enjoyable, but it wasn&#39;t her chosen method of
escapism. Give her a good horror novel however and you might not hear
from her for days.

    For Sylvie, growing up with two brothers, although she loved them
dearly, meant lots of suppressed stress, and her parents&#39; split hadn&#39;t
helped one bit. For the short quiet girl this kind of show was her way
of letting go for a little while.

    Angelica on the other hand just loved the action. &quot;Now that&#39;s
entertainment!&quot;

    &quot;Shhh!&quot; came three pairs of lips.

    &quot;Hey Crow, that guy kind of reminds me of you, just with worse
hair!&quot;

    Crow gave her a sideways glance as the bullets flew again.
&quot;Thanks, but I like my hair.&quot; He turned his eyes back to the new on-
screen developments. &quot;... Mind you, I wouldn&#39;t mind being able to do
moves like that.&quot;

    Sylvie just took another handful of popcorn.

***

    Tataku gazed off into space from the observation deck of the Gal&#39;s
army, watching as the white ship out there turned and rolled
elegantly. Yae really was a great pilot.

    Tataku now knew Yae was more than someone she simply found
attractive and pleasant to be around. Every day she meant more, little
by little, and it almost scared her. She really was falling in love,
for the first time in her life. She could only hope Yae felt the same
way, because it was going to be hard to say goodbye.

    That was the thing she hadn&#39;t planned. She had been so wrapped up
in her own feelings of pity and affection for the woman she hadn&#39;t
considered the fact she would have to go back to school after this was
over, and Yae would carry on with her job by Sylvie&#39;s side. Yae&#39;s
whole life revolved around Sylvie and the ship the two of them shared,
and it pained her to know that. She couldn&#39;t begrudge the short girl
for it though. She was a friend, as close as any she had, and the two
worked wonderfully as a team.

    Tataku didn&#39;t really know what she was going to do with her
eventual degree, but she knew she wanted Yae to be a part of it.
Whether actually working side by side or simply being able to see each
other when they could she didn&#39;t know, but that was what she was going
to strive for. She only prayed it was possible.

    Behind her Jei walked slowly in, her boots sounding heavy in the
quiet air.

    &quot;Hello Jei,&quot; she said pleasantly. &quot;Was the film good?&quot;

    Jei took a seat on the floor next to her and lay her hands in her
lap. &quot;Yes. I&#39;m sorry it was not to your taste. Sylvie said she would
find something less coarse next time.&quot;

    Tataku smiled almost apologetically for leaving the viewing. &quot;It
was a little violent, but you don&#39;t have to accommodate me. Really.&quot;

    &quot;Since your role of commercial asset is no longer valid you are
actually a guest among us. You should be afforded the courtesy a guest
is given.&quot;

    &quot;Really, it&#39;s okay.&quot; Tataku looked back out into the void. &quot;It&#39;s a
nice ship.&quot; The colour scheme actually worked quite well, white and
grey with yellow/orange highlights. It wasn&#39;t as flashy as most
racers, but humans never were as colourful in their designs as her own
people.

    Jei nodded. &quot;I thought so. I&#39;m glad you approve.&quot;

    &quot;What are you going to call it?&quot;

    Jei brow furrowed slightly as she considered the question. &quot;I
don&#39;t actually know. It doesn&#39;t matter. My last ship was the
Moonlight, so perhaps Starlight.&quot;

    Tataku nodded. It sounded nice to her. &quot;Does it mean anything? The
type of name I mean.&quot;

    &quot;Not really.&quot; Jei said as she gazed out. &lt;Nothing important.&gt;

***

    Yae fidgeted nervously with her fingernails as she stood waiting
at the gangway to the Gal&#39;s Army. Truth be told she had never really
been on a proper formal date before, let alone one to anywhere as
classy as Angelica said this place was. It was the one time on this
trip she had been thankful to have Angelica aboard, because whatever
else she was she had a great eye for an outfit.

    She had taken her to a tailor onboard the small station and
managed to make a fair impression on Yae&#39;s usually unremarkable
appearance. The jeans were replaced with a well cut pair of black
trousers that proved she did in fact have more than a pair of poles to
stand on and the iconic flight jacket was missing for the first time
in seven years. In its place was, essentially, a black T-shirt, but
one that screamed class as it fitted around her, showing just a little
midriff and making the most of what little bust she had. From the
lower side, a silver-embroidered, thin-leaved frond reached up across
the side as though it was calling you to see its wearer, and the
ensemble was finished off with a simple silver necklace.
Unconventional, but surprisingly effective. Looking in the mirror she
couldn&#39;t remember the last time she looked quite as feminine as she
did now.

    Off at the side Angelica admired her handiwork while Jei and Crow
watched her nervousness with small smiles. It was like looking at a
teen waiting for her first date.

    Finally after ten agonising minutes, Tataku appeared with Sylvie
behind, her waiting to see her friend&#39;s face. Needless to say she
wasn&#39;t disappointed.

    Yae&#39;s jaw almost fell right off as Tataku slowly, and with a great
deal of nervousness, walked down to meet her. A strapless dress of
gentle blue hugged her body, falling to just above the knee where it
ended in a daring slant. It blended with her hair beautifully as it
cascaded down her shoulders, framing her face and a new pair of
stunning glasses giving her an air of elegance some might not have
though possible.

    Later Yae confided that had she not had the discipline she did she
might have started drooling.

    Gathering her wits she pulled herself up straight and gulped,
trying to regain control of her vocal chords. &quot;Wow. You look
stunning.&quot;

    Tataku smiles beatifically and blushed. &quot;So do you.&quot;

    Yae didn&#39;t believe it for a second but decided now was not the
time. If nothing else Crow would cut the sentence right off. His
tolerance level for the &#39;mutual appreciation society&#39; as he called the
two of them, was not infinite.

    After a small silence Yae held out her arm, much to everybody&#39;s
satisfaction. &quot;Well, shall we?&quot;

    Tataku just nodded as she slipped her own arm into her date&#39;s.
&quot;Let&#39;s.&quot;

    &quot;Have fun,&quot; Sylvie called as the pair headed for their
destination.

    &quot;Don&#39;t do anything I would do,&quot; Angelica added mirthfully.

    Crow started to give the expected response before thinking better
of it. Angelica was stronger than him.

    Jei&#39;s smile turned slightly melancholy as the pair disappeared.
&quot;Good for you. And good luck.&quot;

    Sylvie gave a happy sigh. Helping Tataku get ready had been fun.
Angelica was of the same mind about her trip with Yae. It hadn&#39;t been
easy, but they got there in the end, and it had definitely been worth
it.

    &quot;So,&quot; she said, clapping her hands and dispelling the air of calm,
&quot;let&#39;s get drinking!&quot;

***

    Tataku had been right - the restaurant was wonderful. High class
business men and women, politicians and the other couples who had been
willing to splash out for the night talked and danced in the
romantically lit room surrounded by a breathtaking nebula spectacle
outside. It was extravagant, but worth every credit to those who had
come.

    However, as the night wore on Tataku noticed Yae&#39;s mood become
sombre, no matter how hard she tried to disguise it. They had started
off just as she had dreamed they would, and seeing Yae&#39;s metaphorical
socks get blown off as they entered the place had been very
satisfying. So had her reaction to the dress. She had strived very
hard to make sure this date was a night they would want to repeat, and
up until the last few minutes she had thought she had succeeded. She
only hoped it wasn&#39;t something she had done, or not done, that was
causing Yae&#39;s quiet mood.

    She set down her spoon and gave her a sad look as the woman
opposite almost listlessly ate her sorbet. &quot;Yae, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

    Yae looked up in surprise and smiled. &quot;Wha..? Nothing. I just
can&#39;t believe I&#39;m in a place like this.&quot;

    &quot;Please Yae, I want to know, and we&#39;ve talked enough for me to
know that isn&#39;t it. I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m not good company.&quot;

    Yae stared at her, scandalised she would think like that about
herself if her own behaviour was bad enough to show. &quot;No! Tataku
honestly I&#39;ve had a wonderful night and I wouldn&#39;t ask for anyone else
to share it with. It&#39;s my own problem, I&#39;ll deal with it.&quot;

    Tataku smiled sympathetically and reached over to take Yae&#39;s hand
across the table. &quot;Yae, I want you to talk to me. If I didn&#39;t, I
wouldn&#39;t have offered to listen. If you don&#39;t tell me... I won&#39;t know
why the woman I asked to dinner is unhappy on her date.&quot;

    &quot;Oh God Tataku please don&#39;t say it like that.&quot; She gave a watery
eyed grin. &quot;You&#39;re good at that guilt trip stuff you know.&quot;

    Tataku gave her hand a soft squeeze. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but you look like
you&#39;re about to cry Yae. Please, I want to help.&quot;

    Yae looked down at her food almost in shame. &quot;Tataku, I know how I
feel about you, and it&#39;s getting to be more than a friend, just like I
wanted.&quot;

    Tataku&#39;s heart soared, it was confusion that reigned her mind. &quot;W-
why is that bad? I thought...&quot;

    &quot;Because I love Sylvie.&quot; Yae&#39;s tear filled eyes met Tataku&#39;s in a
moment of pure understanding. &quot;I&#39;ve loved her for years, and I can&#39;t
stop. It... it feels like I&#39;m betraying her.&quot;

    She rubbed her eyes quickly and gave a rueful smile. &quot;I know it&#39;s
stupid. I mean, she doesn&#39;t love me. She never will. But it still
feels like that.&quot;

    Tataku knew she couldn&#39;t let herself cry at what she was about to
say. It was too important. &quot;Yae, if you don&#39;t want to, that&#39;s okay.
I&#39;m sorry I pushed you into this. I didn&#39;t mean to. I know I&#39;m not
her.&quot;

    It hit Yae like an express train. Not only was Tataku still
willing to blame herself, but she was willing to walk away, all
because stupid little Yaedite couldn&#39;t sort herself out. Sylvie was
out of the picture, and she knew that. That meant that logically there
was only one question. Could she say, honestly and sincerely, that she
was in love with Tataku? That was what started it off. She was.

    &quot;No! I don&#39;t want you to be her. Because,&quot; she reached over the
table with her other hand and placed it on top of the green haired
woman&#39;s, &quot;because if you were, you wouldn&#39;t love me either.&quot;

    And Tataku&#39;s face broke into the most captivating smile she had
ever seen. &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m glad.&quot;

    The pair sat for a while, their eyes saying all that needed to be
said. They both knew they wanted this to happen, even if it was going
to be bumpy getting there. Yae was going to work out her conflicting
emotions, and Tataku would be there with her. Had it taken a long
time, or no time at all? Neither really knew, but they were glad it
had, because perhaps they needed it. And each other.

    &quot;Want to dance?&quot; Yae held out her hand.

    Tataku took it with a happy smile. &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

    The pair left what remained of their desserts and made their way
onto the floor in the middle of the restaurant to join the other
couples in their slow movement.

    Yae took the lead, and even though she was the taller of the two
Tataku leaned into her as the danced, still smiling. &quot;Yae, thank you.&quot;

    Yae smiled back. &quot;That&#39;s my line.&quot;

    At an unspoken signal they both leaned forward in their moving
embrace and, as their lips met, the rest of the universe ceased to
matter.

***

    &quot;Hey... What you so smilin&#39; abou&#39; Sylli-chan?&quot; Angelica slurred
through her pint.

    Sylvie just kept grinning and took another sip of her drink. It
wasn&#39;t right to tell on people&#39;s minds, but it was okay for her to
know because she couldn&#39;t help it. And Yae was happy! Another slice of
pizza managed to find its way to her mouth, giving her an excuse not
to speak. It wasn&#39;t polite to speak with your mouth full of pizza. Or
anything else for that matter, but she liked pizza, so pizza it was.

    Crow however was above the fast food the others were taking in, so
it was a steak and bottle of best red he was working on in the pre-
race party bar. He was perhaps the most sober of the four, but only
because he had good alcohol tolerance. There wasn&#39;t much he had a good
tolerance for, but alcohol was one of them. Even so, he made up for
not rambling out loud by rambling in his head instead.

    Jei just sat there with an odd smile on her face, chatting slowly
with Crow and Angelica on either side of her when something came up,
and successfully ignoring the not unattractive man that was trying and
failing miserably to pick Angelica up.

    &quot;Look Jubei,&quot; the outlaw said around the mouthful of high class
curry, which was helping to take the edge off her equally high class
beer and visa versa, &quot;sod off. You wanna know how&#39;ta flirt with me?&quot;

    The man gave a real lady killer smile and tilted his head forward.
&quot;Well, my usual style&#39;s never failed me before, but evidently a girl
of your calibre requires a new approach, so I&#39;m all ears.&quot;

    &quot;Now you&#39;re jus&#39; getting&#39; sloppy Ju-chan. The best way to&#39;n
outlaw&#39;s heart is her stomach.&quot; She held up her now empty mug and
smiled suggestively.

    The four had finally realised that, despite this being a drinking
night, they had not yet eaten properly all day with all the race admin
stuff to do. It had been a nice surprise that they could eat at the
bar stool, since right now at least one of them was in no condition to
actually stagger to a table. As such they all had great seats for
ordering, and Tendu Jubei, freelancer and a strong favourite in the
race whistled to the barkeeper for a couple of drinks.

    The Gauoli barkeep nodded and mixed the heavy concoction with a
flair that only a five foot purple-green alien could. Sylvie decided
not to look, concentrating on her pizza instead. Watching those
distended limbs flail like that made her queasy.

    Angelica however grinned evilly as she took the proffered drink
and clinked her glass with Tendu&#39;s. &quot;Now, there&#39;s one import&#39;nt rule
to flirtin&#39; with Angelica. Don&#39;t.&quot;

    Then, without warning, she grabbed Jei and pulled her into a
*very* passionate kiss. Everyone else just blinked before Jubei broke
out laughing, knowing he&#39;d been had. &quot;Well played hon, well played.&quot;

    He downed the rest of the drink and rose to his feet a little
unsteadily. &quot;Heh heh, well then, I&#39;ll see you on the race line then,
just long enough to pass you by.&quot;

    Angelica shut her eyes and threw back her head. &quot;In your DREAMS!
We&#39;re gonna *kick* *your* *ASS*!&quot; The two of them smirked at each
other as the man left her to her food.

    &quot;Sorry Jei-Jei,&quot; she said, patting her on the back, &quot;but I&#39;s too
drunk to be bothered to talk my way outta that.&quot;

    Jei looked at her sullenly and took another bite out of her
gargantuan burger.

    &quot;Don&#39;t be like that! Come on, I&#39;ll buy you &#39;nother drink.&quot;

    The Gauoli was there almost instantly. &quot;What&#39;ll it be?&quot;

    Jei&#39;s mind went blank a she looked down into her glass. &quot;Right.&quot;
She swung her head around to look down the line of patrons who were at
the bar and here eyes locked onto a depressed looking young teen
sighing into her drink.

    &quot;What she&#39;s having.&quot;

    The Gauoli followed her finger and did a split take. &quot;You *are*
human right?&quot;

    &quot;Yeah,&quot; Jei replied spikily, &quot;what of it?&quot;

    &quot;Then you *don&#39;t* want what she&#39;s having. Trust me.&quot;

    Jei took another look at the girl and her drink. &lt;Maybe muddy red
isn&#39;t the best colour for my next one anyway.&gt; She gave him a dull
look. &quot;Whatever. Same again.&quot;

    The quartet lapsed back into friendly conversation until Sylvie&#39;s
scream shook the bar.

    &quot;All go tonight isn&#39;t it?&quot; Crow asked nobody in particular as they
assessed their race partner&#39;s situation.

    &quot;What it is?&quot; Jei asked, critically poking the large, smelly thing
that had attached itself to Sylvie&#39;s rear.

    &quot;I DON&#39;T CARE!&quot; Sylvie cried as she clutched to the bar top for
what she thought was dear life. &quot;GET IT OFF!&quot;

    &quot;It is Gorgonius,&quot; said the bin standing behind Jei.

    &quot;Oh. Right.&quot; Jei decided she was better off not knowing why the
bin behind her was talking and just accept it as the source of
information that it obviously was. There was also the fact it hadn&#39;t
been there a few seconds before, but she put that down to the drink.
Talking bins don&#39;t just appear out of nowhere after all.

    &quot;That&#39;s right pretty lady,&quot; said the haggard, wrinkled and
thoroughly disgusting &#39;man&#39; as Angelica wrenched him off poor Sylvie&#39;s
buttocks. &quot;How about you and me go and have some fun.&quot; His perverted
leer got him further than he had ever got with a woman before.
Angelica actually favoured him with an expression that wasn&#39;t of pure
disgust.

    &quot;I didn&#39;t realise I was such a guy magnet around here,&quot; she
quipped, before throwing him over the counter where the barkeeper
brained him with an empty bottle.

    &quot;One day I&#39;m going to find a way of keeping him out,&quot; the
exasperated Gauoli sighed. &quot;One day.&quot;

    &quot;Hey, robot,&quot; Angelica called as Jei worked on getting Sylvie
calmed down, &quot;you with this thing?&quot;

    &quot;I am programmed to accompany it.&quot; Its goggly white eyes swayed
expressionlessly from its top.

    &quot;What&#39;s your programming?&quot; Sylvie asked, still working on getting
her breath and her dignity back.

    &quot;I am a sanitation machine.&quot;

    &quot;Then sanitise him!&quot; she almost growled and hauled him back over
the bar, smashing him into the sentient bin.

    The bin analysed him for a second before concluding that yes, he
was the most unsanitary thing in the room and promptly opened its
lid/mouth/whatever and dropped him in.

    Unfortunately the impact with the various discarded items the
machine had been cleaning all evening was enough to bring him around
and the patrons were treated to the muffled sound of, &quot;Let me out of
here you worthless good for nothing piece of tin plated.. er... *tin*!
When I get out I&#39;ll give you my karate chop! I&#39;ll use my sub-space
photon laser catapult on you, I&#39;ll - Ooh, this one&#39;s still full!
*gulp* *gulp* Ahh!&quot;

    The quartet stared as the bin squeaked off on its mismatched
wheels.

    &quot;Riiiiight. Back to that steak,&quot; Crow deadpanned.

    &quot;And another round!&quot; called Angelica. &quot;Andy&#39;s not pulling his
weight!&quot;

    The stuffed panda on Sylvie&#39;s belt just sat there as Sylvie
collapsed into hysterical laughter.

***

    &quot;So, you were gonna go for Jei-Jei, huh?&quot;

    The teen nodded, a crooked smile on her face. &quot;Well, it would have
been nice to try, but I guess tonight isn&#39;t the night.&quot;

    Jei just huffed into her last beer. The &#39;girl&#39; was apparently not
as human as she looked and had clumsily joined them where they decided
chairs would be safer than bar stools. Sylvie just kept falling off
hers.

    &quot;Sso, why are you heer?&quot; Sylvie asked before Angelica could reveal
that she wasn&#39;t actually &#39;with&#39; Jei. She had a feeling Jei would
prefer to stay unattached right now.

    &quot;Oh,&quot; said the teen, taking a sip of whatever it was Jei
apparently didn&#39;t want, &quot;vengeance, research, the usual.&quot;

    It turned out her last &#39;partner&#39; had been killed and she was going
after the murderer. Apparently there was a chance that he or she would
be at the race. Sin, as she had introduced herself, was a lot older
than she looked, but they were all drunk enough to believe her
whatever age she seemed.

    &quot;Ah, well, least I&#39;m not the only one hunting.&quot; Crow sat back and
ran his fingers through his hair. &quot;Good luck.&quot;

    Sin smiled appreciatively. &quot;You too.&quot; She still had no idea
whether he was another of her kind, but it was clear he wasn&#39;t going
to talk about it. She let out a sigh. &quot;This is the first time I&#39;ve let
go like this in ages. Nice not to be tense for once.&quot;

    &quot;You&#39;re not the only one.&quot; Jei slumped back and closed her eyes.

    &quot;And admit it Jei-Jei,&quot; Angelica niggled blearily, &quot;you&#39;ve loved
the hell outta it!&quot;

    &quot;Yeah,&quot; Jei almost sighed out, &quot;that I did.&quot;

    &quot;VICTORY!&quot; Angelica leaped into the air, knocking over the table
in the process. &quot;Ooops!&quot;

    After the table was back where it belonged they carried on
chatting idly until well into the early morning until Sin told then
she needed to get going for some good sleep. For a nocturnal girl she
liked to get to bed early. It meant more good night to live, and she&#39;d
have a hell of a hangover when she woke up.

    The other four made their way back to the Gal&#39;s Army propping each
other up. In fact they almost had to carry Sylvie, but she&#39;d been on
the water during the last hour so she&#39;d be in less pain when she
managed to wake up.

    The sight that met them was one that they couldn&#39;t help but fawn
over. Yae and Tataku had fallen asleep on each other&#39;s shoulders on
the settee, still in their fancy clothes.

    Crow chuckled before bidding them goodnight and staggering back to
his ship while Sylvie just managed, &quot;Awwww!&quot; before falling asleep on
the spot, leaving the other two to catch her.

    After putting her to bed Jei went back to the other room to look
in on the sleeping couple.

    &quot;Jealous?&quot;

    Jei nodded. &quot;Yes.&quot;

    &quot;Well,&quot; said Angelica, &quot;If&#39;t makes you feel any better you&#39;re a
good kisser, even if you were half dead from shock at the time.&quot;

    Jei&#39;s face darkened in a real frown, but she couldn&#39;t find the
will to be angry. &quot;Shut up.&quot;

    &quot;What, don&#39; believe me? Here.&quot; She dashed forward and locked lips
again.

    As soon as Jei&#39;s senses returned she threw Angelica off her and
cracked her palm across the blonde&#39;s face, only to receive one a
second later. She swung out again in pure reflex, but this time found
herself countered as Angelica leaped at her, wrapping her legs around
her and slamming them both into the wall as she kissed with as much
passion as she could muster.

    Jei couldn&#39;t do anything but kiss back. Somewhere inside her mind
her other self was screaming in pure hysteria, but she wanted to be
wanted by someone else. She was in love with the concept. A concept
she could never attain.

    But Angelica was kissing her. One of the most irritating people
she had ever met, but one who had done everything to help her. One who
had done everything she could to stay rather than leave at the first
opportunity.

    When Angelica came back up for air she was as shocked as Jei was.
Jei had actually been kissing back. Not only was this a great
opportunity, but Jei was all she had right now. She knew she wasn&#39;t
thinking clearly, but if Jei wanted that she sure as hell wasn&#39;t going
say she didn&#39;t.

    &quot;That was intense,&quot; she gasped.

    Jei just stared at her with as much hope as confusion.

    &quot;You, wanna go f&#39;r&#39;it? &#39;cz I&#39;m game.&quot;

    Jei felt herself begin to shudder. &quot;I couldn&#39;t say no, even if I
wanted to.&quot; It scared her, but there were no defences left to hide
behind.

    There was no hesitation as Angelica hauled her to her feet and out
to the deserted brig room - and the rest, as they say, is history.
