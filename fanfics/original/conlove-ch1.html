<h1>Conventional Love</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/takemenew.html">La Parka Girl/Take Me New</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      It was only noon, and already the pigtails were driving me up a 
wall.  Why did gnomes have to wear such oversized, mutton-shaped clumps 
of hair?  Sure, thanks to the temporary dye I had bought I was able to 
emulate that bright pink hue just fine, but now I was really starting to 
regret it as I felt the huge things pulling back on my scalp.

      Well, nobody said cosplaying was easy, and so far at least the 
reaction I had received was worth it.

      The guy who ran the turnstile at the entrance had really thought 
it was cute, and even said I was one of the best he had seen so far.  I 
had accented the gnomish pigtails with a blue and white wizard robe to 
simulate one of the dozens of similar generic caster items in the game, 
and a plastic dagger I bought at the dollar store.  It wasn&#39;t the most 
complicated or expensive costume at the Warcraft convention, but it 
looked all right.

      For once I was grateful that I was just under five feet tall, it 
made it so much more believable.

      Costume aside, so far the convention had been a lot of fun.  I 
spoke with a few developers, posed for a few pictures with other fans, 
and by noon my cheesey plastic bag with the Alliance symbol was filled 
with useless junk.  A pamphlet for a new game coming out, a few odds and 
ends with various Warcraft faction symbols on them, and a toy 
mechanostrider that I just had to buy for my desk at work.

      For my first convention, the only complaint I had was that I 
didn&#39;t have anyone to go with.  That thought struck me again shortly 
after noon, just as I had stepped to the side of the enormous crowds to 
once again adjust the pigtails.  I plopped down the bag of giveaways and 
fidgeted with them impatiently, tugging and yanking at the pigtail 
clasps to make them fit more snugly.

      As I messed with my almost painfully pink hair, I couldn&#39;t help 
but take notice of all the couples.  The stereotype of the dateless male 
loser at these things was true to some extent, but a casual non-dork 
citizen would&#39;ve been amazed at all the relationships flitting about.  A 
shirtless, semi-muscular guy painted in green was walking hand-in-hand 
with a girl whose face had been flushed and pale, an adorable Horde duo 
now looking over a selection of posters.  An older couple, far too 
mature for the nonsense of cosplaying, sat contently at a nearby table, 
sharing a basket of fries from the food court.  And finally with a 
giggle I noticed a pair of young men dressed like Blood Elves, cuddling 
into one another while they watched a demo at a nearby table.

      Hey, at least they picked the right race.

      It was sweet to an extreme, but for all the cuteness of the duos I 
was forced to think back to my own partner, my own mate that was 
supposed to come along with me.  He was going to go as his dwarf 
paladin, and had even gone so far as to purchase the fake beard in 
preparation for the event.  (The idea of him growing his own so long was 
simply laughable, given his inability to even grow chest hair.)

      But as things would have it, tickets you sign up for months in 
advance aren&#39;t always ones you&#39;ll use.  By the time I had received them 
in the mail he was already gone, left for me some tramp he met at the 
comic book store.

      There&#39;s something funny about infidelity when nerds do it?  I 
guess it&#39;s because of the locations.  We don&#39;t fuck around in a sleazy 
parking lot or at a seedy, smoke-filled bar.  We cheat on each other in 
the library, or at the arcade, or at our parent&#39;s house while Smash 
Brothers melee is on pause.

      My favorite is Kirby, by the way.  And I was super pissed when I 
heard Brawl was pushed back to March.

      At any rate, my boyfriend and comic whore first kissed right in 
front of a display of Magic: The Gathering cards, and with that kiss he 
tapped two black mana and used an instant to destroy our love.

      Stop laughing, it was traumatic.

      I graduated from college a few months later and got a job at a 
nearby retail place, and still saw him on occasion walking around with 
her.  One time I even dared to speak to him, but he was so distant and 
unaffected it was clear that he moved on.  So when the tickets to the 
convention arrived I resolved myself to go, even if I had to by myself.  
It had been what I was looking forward to for months, and I wasn&#39;t about 
to deprive myself of my first convention just because he couldn&#39;t keep 
his Meekstone card to himself.

      You can laugh at that one, it was meant to be funny.

      Just as I had let loose a tiny sigh from the back of my throat, it 
was absorbed by the noise of the people around me.  Chatting about their 
characters, trading information like server and side and name, enjoying 
being in an environment where our dorkiness was celebrated rather than 
shunned.

      The noise was louder down near the poster booth, and I turned my 
head to see if the orc and undead couple were posing for more pictures.  
Certainly there were dozens of flashes going off, but I was surprised to 
see that the Horde duo had long since moved on.

      The attention was centered around a girl, no older than twenty or 
so, casually flipping through a set of page-sized posters the right 
proportions for putting at a desk or cubicle.  She was unique in several 
ways, the first of which being that she had decided to come to the 
convention in one of the most attention whoring outfits imaginable.

      A Night Elf sentinel.

      A fake-metal bikini was accented by large leather boots that went 
up to her knees, and thick gloves that went halfway to her elbow.  Large 
metal shoulder pads were almost the exact same size as the cups of the 
breastplate, which even I could tell was over exaggerating the size of 
her chest by a significant degree.  The skin which could be seen; which 
was in massive abundance, had all been painted a rich deep purple, 
flawlessly matching in-game colors to a delightful level that allowed me 
to indulge in my appreciate for geek-riddled attention.  Likewise her 
hair; if it was indeed her own hair and not a wig, was pulled back into 
an almost ludicrously long ponytail, and capped with an elvish-looking 
bead near the end to hold it all into place.  A half  helmet wrapped 
around her head, metal plates draping down either cheek with the face 
fully exposed.  It was that sort of pure fantasy armor that would&#39;ve 
offered no protection in the real world, but looked oh-so-stylish when 
worn on the body of someone that knew how to carry it.

      This girl did, and the cameras were eager to see it.

      I hadn&#39;t yet seen her face, but her body was quite appealing, if a 
bit clich&#130;d amongst our normal gathering.  One of the simple rules of 
being a geek is that you&#39;re either overweight or underweight.  I was the 
former, and she was the latter.  Where my own slightly large hips ruined 
any confidence I would&#39;ve had in such a skimpy outfit, her ultra narrow 
frame had just enough mass to stand with her rump to one side, allowing 
the waistband of the metal bikini to threaten dropping away.  My own 
stomach had a bit of a pot belly to it, but hers was trim and 
delightful, and I had no doubt that she barely would&#39;ve used even a 
single canister of body paint to cover all of that exposed flesh.  As I 
mentioned her breasts were small, much smaller than the metal bikini 
indicated, and it was the one area where I felt a bit superior to this 
mysterious night elf.  My own chest was ample thanks to one of the few 
blessings of being fat, while hers was so small as to be almost 
non-existent.  As a final contrast the elf girl was tall, even moreso 
than some of the boys surrounding her, standing what had to be at least 
close to six feet, if not hitting that marker itself.  A tall, thin girl 
dressed as a night elf...and a pudgy, short girl dressed as a gnome.

      If we had met each other earlier, we could&#39;ve signed up for the 
duos costume competition and been guaranteed a victory.

      As the mysterious Night Elf continued to casually inspect the 
comics, my eyes drifted across the crowd to the various people watching 
her.  There were a few of the stereotypical desperate teenage boys, 
gawking with obvious, slack-jawed expressions at a nicely shaped female 
that decided to parade around wearing practically nothing.  They were 
the sort that were still at the age that it was cute to be charmingly 
inexperienced, and they had at least five years before their social 
awkwardness made them downright creepy to talk to.  Speaking of, the 
much older variety were also peering at her, and in far greater numbers.  
Trying to be subtle about their staring they peeked from behind the 
edges of magazines, around the fringes of the crowd, and a few even 
dared to casually glance at the posters on the table, inching ever 
closer to her.  Finally there was a rep for the convention taking his 
own photos with an expensive camera, and I could tell by the smirk on 
his face that he was just as entertained as I was by the clich&#130;s 
surrounding the scene.

      The Night Elf turned around to walk away from the table, seemingly 
unknowing of the small following she had collected.  At last now I could 
see her face, and I admit that at the same time I was both relieved and 
disappointed.  If she had been a beauty queen of the highest level, I 
would&#39;ve been confused to the point of going cross-eyed.  Let&#39;s face it, 
we&#39;re not the most attractive culture in the world.  Despite our wildly 
fluxuating weights we&#39;re usually slapped with eyeglasses and pimples, or 
disproportionate faces that are outlined by shaggy, maniacal hair.

      True story.  At the opening of the Two Towers, there were so many 
greasy ponytails I almost choked on my Milk Duds.

      She was cute for one of our kind, but she wasn&#39;t beautiful like 
one of them.  One of the outsiders that didn&#39;t understand our world, or 
our fascination with the bizarre, the arcane, and the misunderstood.  To 
them she would be average.

      She had bright blue eyes with thin blonde eyebrows, indicating the 
true color of her hair in contrast to the mass of startling white that 
clung around her head.  Her smile was sweet and simple, with bright 
white teeth that stood in perfect formation.  She had the sort of smile 
that put me in mind of someone who wore braces, which made me 
immediately wonder if perhaps she was just recently out of them.  A nose 
a single size too small for her face was bent ever so gently up at the 
tip, and the entire face was covered in that same purple body paint, 
with lipstick a little bit darker spread around her too-large mouth.

      The girl moved past the crowd and eventually drew upon me, and I 
blushed and smiled when she finally made eye contact.  The look on her 
face was a charmingly, friendly sort of exasperation, and as the horde 
behind her continued to follow, she took the chance to roll her eyes, a 
humorous sign only I could see.  Before I knew it she had moved past me 
and a door swung open, and I turned around to watch while the group let 
loose with a collective, disappointed moan.

      The tiny embossed lady figure on the door was proof enough that no 
one from this crowd would be getting inside. 

      I slipped into the ladies&#39; room after moving quickly past the 
crowd, curiously pursuing the Night Elf that had caused such a scene 
only to quickly vacate the premises.  Noise from the outside filled the 
room but silenced into a muffled sound once the door was closed, and 
already I could smell the distinct odor of a burning cigarette.  Moving 
through the tiny alcove past the door I came into the main portion of 
the room, and saw her.

      It was almost a laughably ridiculous sight, an armored, 
purple-skin maiden sitting on the low windowsill of the bathroom, one 
leg up against the opposite side while she clutched a cigarette in 
between two thickly-gloved fingers.  The mass of white hair was now 
sitting on the nearby sink, the long ponytail bunched up and folded over 
itself to avoid laying on the floor.  In its stead I was able to see the 
girl&#39;s true hair, bright and blonde and falling down to near the bottom 
of her cheeks.  As I entered she turned her head and gave me a small 
smirk, her wide lips turning up into a welcoming and friendly 
expression.

      &quot;When is that developer making his speech about the Witch King 
expansion?&quot;  She abruptly asked, and didn&#39;t wait for my answer before 
taking in another long drag of her cigarette.  Eager to answer I set my 
bag of convention memorabilia on the nearby counter, and quickly 
rummaged through to find the schedule of events.  I could hear my own 
voice echoing in the bathroom, but it almost felt surreal, as if I 
couldn&#39;t imagine myself talking.

      &quot;Well, let&#39;s see...&quot;  I paused, scanning over the chain of events.  
&quot;At twelve-thirty there&#39;s the card game tournament, then at one o&#39;clock 
the costume competition.  Looks like they&#39;re not going to be doing the 
expansion thing until one thirty at the earliest.&quot;  The girl chuckled a 
little, and pursed her falsely purple lips to let some of the smoke slip 
through the cracked windowsill.

      &quot;I&#39;ll sneak out when they do that, maybe by then the crowd will 
have died down some.&quot;  She paused for a moment, and her blue eyes 
narrowed as she slightly turned the cigarette back and forth in her 
fingers.  Musing mostly to herself, I had to strain to hear anything she 
said.  &quot;This was such a stupid idea, I don&#39;t know what I was thinking.  
All those people watching me, it&#39;s not my thing at all.&quot;

      I smiled a little bit, and began to slowly make my way over to 
where she half-sat on the sill.  My own short, large body leaned against 
the wall beside her, and I tilted my head to look in her direction.  
Even though one of those ridiculous pink ponytails was in the way, I 
could see her face enough to know she was looking back.

      &quot;You don&#39;t seem like the type.&quot;  I offered, shrugging my shoulders 
a little.  &quot;Dressing up to tease and make a spectacle of yourself.  Did 
your boyfriend make you do it?&quot;  To this the girl gave a resounding 
laugh, and she drew another long bit of breath from her smoke.

      &quot;Oh, gnomey, if you only knew the many things wrong with that 
question.&quot;  She chuckled, and my eyes followed as tendrils of gray smoke 
drifted from her nostrils.  &quot;Nah, this was my idea.  Thought maybe it&#39;d 
be fun to get out of the apartment for a change, dress up all sexy, get 
a little bit of attention.  I can&#39;t tell you how many guys offered to 
buy me an epic mount if I come play on their server.&quot;  We both laughed, 
and she reached into a tiny pocket built into her fake-metal bikini, 
pulling out a list of several dozen character names and servers.  With 
complete apathy she lobbed it lightly into the trash can a few feet 
away, and I smirked wide in response.

      &quot;At least people didn&#39;t spend their morning telling you how 
childishly cute you were.&quot;  I replied, rolling my eyes up at the 
pigtails.  &quot;There&#39;s not really a whole lot of interest from the guys 
when you remind them of people that pwn them in PvP with names like 
Taffyhead.&quot;

      We both laughed, and as she covered her mouth with one of her 
gloves I could hear a tiny snort from deep inside her.  Cute.

      We chatted for a while longer, completely uninterrupted by the 
outside of the room.  Turned out her name was Karen, and-

      Oh, wait.  I never told you mine, did I?  It&#39;s Samantha.  Sam 
works.

      Anyways, Karen and I talked for about twenty minutes.  Turned out 
she wasn&#39;t the attention whore I had pegged her for at first, as a 
couple of times she mentioned her regret of dressing up so skimpy.  She 
sounded like she had the same concerns I did about my own body, albeit 
from different perspectives.  It gave us a common ground and we built on 
that with the superficial talks about the game, our characters, and how 
much a Warcraft movie would suck.

      Seriously, it would.  You know it would.  

      Before I knew it one o&#39;clock had come, and we heard the muffled 
voice of the announcer from outside preparing to say who had won the 
costume competition.  I gave a smirk to Karen and reached out a hand, 
poking her exposed, purple tummy with one of my fingers.

      &quot;You should be there for that.  I bet you&#39;d get all kinds of 
awards...and phone numbers.&quot;

      &quot;Nah...&quot;  She had just finished her second cigarette, and was 
preparing to light a third when she suddenly arched an eye, and looked 
up at me with a sudden wave of concern.  &quot;You don&#39;t mind, do you?  
Sorry...I was so stressed, didn&#39;t even think to ask.&quot;

      &quot;No, no...I&#39;m fine.&quot;  I assured her, lying that the cigarette 
smoke didn&#39;t bother me.  She shrugged and lit up as planned, and leaned 
her head back against the frame of the windowsill.

      &quot;Half hour to go...&quot;  She mused, gazing up at the ceiling.  There 
was a moment of quiet in the air, until her voice once more broke out 
into the echoing silence of the bathroom.

      &quot;Hey Sammy...&quot;  I looked casually over, tilting my head curiously.  
When she spoke again, her words hit me like a Pyroblast.

      &quot;You wanna have sex?&quot; 
 
      I stood dumbfounded for a few seconds, staring ahead with my mouth 
wide open and eyes large with shock.  Karen was still casually sitting 
against the windowsill, her eyes flickering now over the cigarette she 
casually twirled in her fingers, not even acknowledging my presence.  
After I had assured myself that I did indeed hear her correctly, I 
stammered out an answer as quickly as I could.

      &quot;Uh...s-sure!&quot;  I cringed at the sound of my own voice; it was 
hesitant and wary, not at all the tone of a confidant woman.  For as 
much as my tone shocked me the words themselves held an even greater 
surprise value, for I suddenly realized what I had just agreed to.  It 
was part reactionary response, part underlying loneliness, and perhaps 
part rampant curiosity.  Whatever it was, it was out there, and I 
suddenly straightened by back to look steadier.

      Karen&#39;s mysterious eyes drifted slowly up to look at me, the 
corners of her wide mouth turning into what was clearly an expression of 
confusion.

      &quot;I...was joking.&quot;  She spoke with a cautious and careful tone, 
each letter of each word murmured with clarity.

      Then came the awkward silence.

      For about a minute neither of us said anything, and we both began 
to mindlessly fidget with pieces of our costumes.  I had found a stray 
thread on the sleeve of my mage robe that merited attention, and from 
the corner of my eye I could see Karen adjusting the length of one of 
her brown leather gloves, tugging it down more so the fingers stretched 
the fabric inside.  Neither of us said anything, and Karen even forgot 
about her cigarette after laying it on the windowsill.

      I pretended to cough to break the silence, but it was transparent 
to say the least.  By now my cheeks were flush with crimson, almost 
brighter than the hair dye in my pigtails.  As I studied that fact in 
the adjacent bathroom mirror, my mind began to swirl with how to get 
myself away from the conversation.  Karen had been a delight to talk to, 
but how could I possibly consider hanging out and chatting more after 
such a colossal embarrassment?  Soon my rapidly drying mouth opened, and 
my voice croaked out a few broken fragments.

      &quot;W-Well, I really s-should get goi-&quot;

      &quot;What the hell?  Let&#39;s go for it.&quot;

      Her voice cut me off, and my head swung so hard around to view her 
that one of my pigtails came free.  My hair was suddenly unleashed from 
its bindings and cascaded across my shoulder in a blinding wave of hot 
pink, and this time I stood staring at her with the same slack jawed 
expression, but with much goofier hair.  Her head had raised and she 
stared back this time, smile slanting to one side in a cocky and 
downright arrogant smirk.

      I wanted her in the worst fucking way. 

      The next thing I knew the door to the nearby stall had been flung 
open, and Karen&#39;s surprisingly strong hands were pushing me back by 
means of a delightful grip on my shoulders.  The back of my knees hit 
the ridge of the toilet and I immediately slumped down atop it, and the 
sound of the door slamming could be heard as Karen kicked back with one 
of her knee-high leather boots.

      If I may break from the upcoming steamy sex scene for a moment, 
I&#39;d like to paint for you a picture of just what the deal was.  You see, 
it&#39;s not surprising that a lot of people within my delightful geek 
community have a distorted view of what sex looks like.  Indeed, thanks 
to the Internet and the abundance of professional quality pornography, 
the average person&#39;s view on how smoothly and beautifully the deed goes 
down is horribly askew.

      Suffice to say, neither Karen nor myself are supermodels.  We 
weren&#39;t wearing Hollywood-grade makeup, and there was no pouty, full, 
collagen-injected lips.  It was a dingy bathroom in the convention 
center of a hotel, so you can also put out of mind any visions of a 
resort-level accommodations in which we made love.

      The passionate part of me wanted her more than anything, but the 
realistic side said there was no way in Hell I was going to get on my 
knees in a public restroom.

      So are you still with me?  Good.  I wanted to dispel any 
preconceived ideas of what the moment looked like.  Because believe me, 
even though it wasn&#39;t a big budget porno, I wouldn&#39;t of traded what I 
had in that bathroom for the world.

      Karen was upon me, and I only had a few brief seconds to take her 
all in.  She tore off her gloves and threw them down to the ground, and 
I could hear the ringing of cheap costume jewelry she had used in their 
construction hitting the cold tile floor.  Immediately her milky white 
palm was at my cheek, and by sheer instinct I found my lips turning into 
her hand, kissing a few times while she cradled my face.  She had great 
hands.  Large for a girl, but her fingers were as thin as the rest of 
her, and they had the calloused texture of a hard worker.

      I love a rough hand, it feels so safe.

      I closed my eyes and relished in the feel of her other hand in my 
hair, undoing that infuriating other pigtail and catching all the 
released strands in her fingers.  My lips traveled further along her 
hand and up her wrist, pausing to dab my tongue atop her flesh where I 
could swear that I could feel her pulse.  When I opened my eyes I could 
see the blend of body paint and skin, the seam on her body at the 
forearm where she had stopped applying makeup because she&#39;d be wearing 
gloves.  Swirls of dark purple separated the woman from the Night Elf, 
just as the hair she now held to her nose and drew breath upon hid a 
woman underneath a gnome.

      I let my hands wrap around her trim waist, and I contented myself 
with tracing lines up and down that slender, lovely back.  She was so 
thin I could easily feel the ridge of her spine down to her tailbone, 
and I teased that trail up and down a few times.  Upon each journey my 
fingers bumped the upper rip of her gaudy &quot;metal&quot; bikini, which I now 
realized was little more than a regular bikini top expertly plated with 
pieces of cardboard and plastic, spray-painted in hues of silver and 
gray.

      Her fingers now met at the back of my neck, gently encouraging my 
gaze to lift upwards.  Not one to refuse the orders of a strange girl in 
a bathroom I let my head crane skyward, and our eyes met in a moment 
lost in the sudden waves of desire.  

      I could almost see the girl that hid behind the paint.  That big 
and friendly smile, those shining aqua eyes, and that softly curved chin 
tapering into a trim, elegant neck.  Her painted lavender lips parted to 
reveal an even more charming smile, and she stretched her neck down so 
that our faces could be brought together.  Hands tightened around each 
other as my new friend drew near, and I couldn&#39;t resist letting my 
fingernails dig into the soft flesh of her waist in anticipation.

      I never kissed another girl before then, it was a pretty big 
moment in my life.

      You don&#39;t believe me? ...well, your mom doesn&#39;t count.  Hee!

      I used to hate the smell of cigarette smoke, but the second I 
could breath it in off of Karen&#39;s sweet mouth, I knew just how addictive 
it could be.  My eyes fell closed as her hands swept around to grip my 
cheeks, and then came the warm sensation of lips upon mine.

      Her kiss was slow at first, and I was surprised by it.  Given the 
sudden flurry of excitement and how she had so roughly pushed me into 
the bathroom, I had half expected to be completely ravaged without any 
patience or pause.  Part of me had imagined it being over before I even 
realized it began, afraid that time would go by so quickly I&#39;d not have 
a second to experience it.  On the contrary though, when we kissed it 
was as if time stood still.

      Clich&#130;, I know, but I mean it.  It had such an impact that I can 
still feel it lingering on my mouth months later, and if I think hard 
enough I can almost taste her flavor that afternoon.  Tobacco, 
peppermint gum, and a fading taste of coffee.

      It was offered to me atop the skills of a strong, thin tongue; 
slipping past my quivering lips and pushing past my own.  I attempted to 
wrestle my tongue against hers but it was a futile battle, she showed 
her dominance by pinning mine to the roof of my mouth several times 
without fail.  Futile battle or no; however, I continued to fight, and I 
enjoyed every last second of it.

      Our mouths separated by means of her biting gently down on my 
lower lip, and pulling apart enough to make me gasp from the excitement.  
My eyes snapped open and we gazed at one another, intently studying the 
features of the other cosplayer.  A hand left my hair and began 
traveling down the length of my robe, and a new game was born between 
us.  She&#39;d do all she could to make me flinch, and I&#39;d try my best to 
pretend like it had no effect on me.

      Our staring contest would&#39;ve normally be even matched, and since 
that day I admit I&#39;ve won my fair share of them against her.  But it&#39;s 
not so easy when an expert like Karen is slipping her fingers in between 
the openings on your robe, touching at whatever strikes her fancy.

      I remained sentinel for a few moments, somehow finding the 
strength to endure even as she petted my bra.  My knees trembled but I 
continued to stare ahead even as her fingers slinked underneath my 
breast, and digits began to knead it from below, molding into it and 
making my heart race faster.  The snap of my bra being pulled over my 
breasts was like a gunshot in the confines of the bathroom, and the 
arrogant smirk playing on her face told me that she knew how close I was 
to breaking.  She could hear the skipping of my breath, see the sweat 
clinging to my forehead, and see the trembling of my lip which so 
desperately craved for the taste of hers again.

      My hands tightened around Karen&#39;s body and I stifled a yelp as she 
first touched my bare nipple with her fingers, brushing across it 
swiftly at first before darting back to give it a lingering pinch.  As 
my fingernails dug into her waist the other nipple was given the same 
attention, and my resolution continued to break down.

      Lips then fell upon my forehead, and a fading moan slipped from 
the back of my throat.  My endurance was nearing its breaking point as 
she continued, giving tiny kisses across my brow and peppering my skin 
with the feel of her deliciously scented breath.

      I lost yet another battle against her when I felt her tongue dab 
away a bead of sweat, and my voice cried out in a sudden surrender.

      &quot;Oh God, fuck me!&quot;  I wailed, and tightened my arms around Karen&#39;s 
waist.  She laughed in her victory and nodded in eager acceptance, large 
hands escaping the folds of my robe to move up again to my shoulders.  
As fingers began the relaxing process of kneading into my sore muscles, 
she whispered against a mass of bright pink hair.

      &quot;You&#39;ve gotta be loud for me, Sammy...&quot;  She gave me a command, 
and her voice was so dominating that it simply made me melt.  I 
whimpered and nodded in agreement, writhing there in my seat, rubbing my 
thighs together in my lap in some desperate gesture of desire and 
anticipation.  Her voice filled me like nectar, each word making me want 
to do her bidding more and more.  &quot;If I have my head underneath that 
robe, you better make sure you&#39;re loud enough for me to hear it.&quot;

      There was a paused moment as she lowered her head a slight bit 
more, and her mouth came in contact with the upper rim of my ear.  I 
shivered from the breath that struck me, but even moreso from the words 
that were whispered.

      &quot;I don&#39;t care if everyone at this fucking thing hears me make you 
cum.&quot;

      A lick across my ear nearly made me black out, but I held on 
through sheer force of will. 

      She disappeared underneath the long azure robe of my gnomish other 
self, kneeling on the floor of the bathroom and effectively vanishing 
save for the thin outline of her body underneath the fabric.  Stretching 
forward I could see the edge of her boots peeking out from the length of 
my garment, and I couldn&#39;t resist a giggle at how wonderfully Karen had 
essentially become a part of me.

      WTB lesbian lover enchant for robe.

      I made good on my word almost immediately, and the ladies room 
filled with the noise of my increasingly loud moaning.  Each feel of 
fingertip along my thighs, each sensation of breath striking my flesh, 
and each frustrating nip of teeth against my panties made my desperation 
become more potent.  I couldn&#39;t even remember what panties I had worn 
that morning, but I was certain that it was nothing erotic or enticing.  
I mean, seriously.  Who wears sexy lingerie to geek gathering?

      Rocky Horror fans, that&#39;s who.  But that&#39;s beside the point.

      Her hands swept underneath my thighs and enriched the entirety of 
my legs, clutching them tightly and holding them apart.  In obedience I 
leaned forward a little and began to stretch my legs outward, lifting 
them until I could fit both of my gnomish work boots (sneakers with 
rawhide glued to them,) against the door of the stall.  I was short 
enough that the action almost made my butt slide off of the seat, but 
thankfully Karen&#39;s grip and even more thankfully, her face, were there 
to keep me from falling completely off.  Her hands tightened and her 
mouth dropped down, and I gave another sharp cry as teeth once more came 
down upon the fabric of my panties.  A single close bite, and she&#39;d pull 
them back an inch until she felt the fabric grow taught, and then 
immediately release them to snap against my skin.  And again.  And then 
a third time.

      &quot;Please don&#39;t tease me!&quot;  I begged, squirming again against her 
amazingly strong hands.  In punishment and reward she turned her head 
from side to side to shower a series of kisses and bites against my 
inner thighs, nothing more than a nibble, and nothing deeper than a 
peck.  It was enough to make me let loose with a slow and pitched whine, 
and briefly I began to wonder if they could hear me outside yet.  I had 
little time to dwell on it, or get my head around the fact that it was 
an arousing thought, until Karen released one of my thighs so her hand 
could go to the panties themselves.

      My hips jerked when she first touched me, two solid fingers held 
against the length of my, er...

      Story&#39;s really heating up, isn&#39;t it?  I don&#39;t mean to break the 
mood, but damned if it doesn&#39;t bother me how some people that write 
erotic stories just use the same word for that area over and over and 
over again.  They&#39;re either obsessed with being vulgar and just rifle of 
pussy a few dozen times, or they&#39;re completely loyal to a clean 
narrative and let loose with ridiculous descriptions like flower, petal, 
valley, rainbow flesh house, et cetera.  

      Anyways, back to Karen dry petting my twat.

      She pushed her front two fingers against me through the cloth of 
my panties, sort of testing the waters to see how ready I had become.  
It wasn&#39;t even a question for debate; there was nothing more that I 
wanted in that instant than her.  I was wet through my panties and I was 
sure she could feel it, because everywhere she touched me seemed to get 
even wetter.  My rear end squirmed back and forth in my seat and I 
whined louder just as I heard her giggle, and then her teasing voice 
echoed from underneath the fancied length of my robe.

      &quot;You want to come back to my hotel tonight?&quot;  She asked, casually 
stroking her fingers up and down my lips.  &quot;I brought my Wii along, so 
we could play some Reside-&quot;

      &quot;Just keep going and I&#39;ll do whatever you want!&quot;  I shouted to cut 
her off, almost angry at the sudden interruption of my pleasure.  My 
voice was so loud that it echoed inside of the bathroom, and I could 
hear faint murmuring from just outside the door.  It could&#39;ve been that 
people hear me, or it could&#39;ve been that they announced Pandaren as a 
playable race in the Witch King expansion.

      Either one of those instances would only make me wetter.

      Karen gave me my wish by suddenly snatching away my panties, 
pulling them aside just enough so that I could feel the rush of fresh 
air against my pussy.  I yelped in surprise and joy when her mouth 
lunged forward, and there came a rapturous moan when she gave me what I 
had been so desperately yearning for.

      Her clever tongue was tracing my folds while her hand was busy 
playing support, dancing across my thighs and pinching in random places 
to keep my sensitive body guessing.  I clutched the rim of the toilet to 
hang on, and my head fell back while my eyes closed, knowing it would 
take all I had to endure the coming onslaught.

      Karen&#39;s forefinger slid inside of me just as I first felt her 
tongue encircle my clit, and my hips bucked violently at the sensation.  
She was clearly far more experienced than me, for the way in which she 
used her tongue was like nothing I had ever felt before.  She was swift 
but precise, attentative and generous.  She was nothing like my ex, who 
just did it to get his own in return.  Within the first few seconds of 
Karen&#39;s tongue working the northern end of my pussy, I could clearly 
tell that she was loving every second of it.

      Echoing now in the stall was not only my heavy moaning, but the 
noise of Karen&#39;s messy slurping.  Several lines of saliva were running 
down my valley, joining with the moisture that had already been building 
up over the past few minute&#39;s events.  The finger inside was twisting 
and turning in all the right ways, hooking inside of me only on random 
instances where her hand would jerk upward as if to lift me off the 
seat.  I gave a piercing cry as a second digit wedged its way inside, 
and Karen straightened both of her fingers so she could test the waters 
of how deep I could take them.

      All the way to the hilt of her hand, if you&#39;re curious.

      By that point my moaning and occasional screaming had reached a 
fevered pitch, and to add to the noise the toilet lid was banging up and 
down as my entire body bounced atop it.  The hinges of the stall&#39;s door 
creaked with both my feet still wedged against it, and as a final lovely 
touch Karen&#39;s own moaning had joined the noise.

      I really shouldn&#39;t of been surprised, but the surprise was part of 
the pleasure.

      I could hear the door to the bathroom being swung open, and a 
brusque female voice shouting into the room.

      &quot;What the hell is going on in here?!&quot;

      Needless to say, I came on the spot.  The sound of splashing 
against the tile was the only thing that preceded the following awkward 
silence. 

      That last part of the story really ended on a hell of a 
cliffhanger, huh?  Yeah, sorry about that.  Ending on a note like that 
is a pretty cheap way to get a response from the audience.  I think the 
technical writer&#39;s term for it is &quot;being a lameass.&quot;  I promise this one 
won&#39;t end on a cliffhanger.  

      So, you&#39;re probably curious about what happened after someone 
burst into the bathroom.  At first, Karen and I didn&#39;t know what to 
think.  It could&#39;ve been a regular person there at the convention, or it 
could&#39;ve been one of the hotel&#39;s rent-a-cops.

      At first we just stayed completely quiet, like whoever it was 
would just go away.  The front of my robe had already been pulled up 
around my waist, and the top half of Karen&#39;s face was peeking out from 
underneath.  Lavender painted skin shyly making an appearance, her blue 
eyes wide with more than just a little surprise.  She was probably 
regretting telling me to be loud.  We glanced to one another and I even 
brought a finger to my lips to encourage our silence, but it wasn&#39;t any 
use.  My lanky lover&#39;s foot was sticking out from underneath the wall of 
the stall, and I watched as the interloper stepped up and kicked at it.

      &quot;All right, c&#39;mon out.  This is security.&quot;

      Generally speaking, when someone identifies themselves as 
&quot;security&quot; instead of &quot;the police,&quot; there&#39;s time to make out for a few 
seconds before listening to them.

      Before Karen started to stand up, I couldn&#39;t help but flash her a 
huge smile to cheer her up.  When she saw me her eyes lit once more and 
her worried look turned to one of mischievous joy.  Once she was up I 
joined her, and we opened the door together so we could face the music. 

      You&#39;d think that getting caught by security while having sex in 
the bathroom would be kinkier than it really was.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, 
the act itself was unbelievable.  Probably the best I&#39;ve ever had up to 
that point.  When we got caught; though, the excitement kind of died 
down.  We listened to the security guard ramble about why what we did 
was wrong, and how we were disturbing the convention.  It was mostly a 
chance for her to stroke her ego, make herself look big, and push around 
someone slightly more civilian than her.

      When it came down to it, what could they do?  Karen and I were 
both over eighteen, no parents to call and complain to.  Would they call 
the real cops on us?

      That&#39;d go over well.  Call the cops to a Warcraft convention 
because two girls were dyking out in the bathroom.  While in cosplay 
gear.

      We&#39;d be fucking legends. Bigger than the guy that made the Jimmy 
YouTube video.

      At any rate, the hotel politely asked us to leave, and we did so 
without much complaint.  Thankfully neither of us were staying at the 
hotel that was holding the convention, so when we got outside we 
exchanged cell phone numbers and headed off to our respective lodging 
for a bit.  Just long enough to shower and change, with the promise of 
spending the rest of the day hanging out with one another.

      About a half hour later I was in the shower, that annoying robe 
bunched up in the corner with a pair of mutilated sneakers on top of it.  
Leaning back against the wall and letting the shower spray strike all 
over me, I finally had a chance to process all that had happened in the 
day.  Just as the hot beads of moisture rained down on every sore muscle 
in my body, the events that had led me to my first lesbian experience 
beat upon my mind with piercing accuracy.

      Never had I imagined that I would&#39;ve ended up in the bathroom 
having sex with a stranger, shouting with the intent to be heard by 
others.  My goal for the day was simple when I woke up that morning, I 
would&#39;ve been content just to get my Alliance T-shirt autographed by a 
few random developers that no one would recognize the name of.  Maybe 
flirt with a few geeky guys, get the code for the next Murloc 
promotion...

      Well, safe to say my rogue wouldn&#39;t be dressed as a murloc anytime 
soon.  I guess it&#39;s a tradeoff.

      I began to rub shampoo into my hair in the hopes of working out 
the temporary dye.  For the most part it worked, but the weak, tiny 
bottle of hotel lather wasn&#39;t able to completely destroy the hot pink 
from my normal natural light brown.  I stayed in the shower for an extra 
fifteen minutes working on cleansing my abused hair from the horrid 
color, the entire time mumbling to myself how stupid I was to think it 
was cute to go as a gnome.  When my shower was over and I stepped, 
soaking wet, onto the bathmat, I glanced at the mirror and had to 
cringe.  While most of my hair was back to its normal color there were 
grotesque streaks of pink in random intervals, showing no rhyme or 
reason other than clearly shouting &quot;I ran out of shampoo.&quot;

      Well, I got dressed while I let my hair dry, hoping it&#39;d look 
better once it wasn&#39;t soaking wet anymore.  Since I didn&#39;t know what was 
totally appropriate to spend the evening with someone you just had 
public sex with, I went with a basic T-shirt and jeans, the spares I had 
brought along in my luggage.  A few more minutes to brush my teeth and 
put on some body spray, and I was ready to go.

      I met Karen a few minutes later near a restaurant we had agreed to 
meet at, and by that time my hair had dried into a somewhat decent 
state.  There were still streaks of pink randomly spaced in it, but it 
looked more like a punk dye job that was slowly fading as opposed to an 
obvious half-ass attempt to clean it out.  Regardless, there was a 
certain knowing smirk on Karen&#39;s lips when she first saw me, and her 
eyes spent their fair share of time enjoying it.

      And speaking of Karen...wow.

      You don&#39;t really get an idea for how pretty someone is when 
they&#39;re in full body paint and dressed like a medieval whore.  When I 
saw her leaning against the wall beside the restaurant, I was nearly 
breathless at beholding what I made out with.  Her trim figure was 
contained now inside the confines of a green and white striped T-shirt, 
which clung to her body without any room for imagination.  Blue jeans 
likewise appeared mostly painted on her body, stretched taught over 
long, lanky legs that crossed so casually at the ankle.  She seemed to 
have more luck with her dye than I did, since her arms and face were all 
a delightful shade of milky white, pale to the point of being the 
trademarked stereotype of nerdy culture.  Her blonde hair only made her 
appear even paler, catching the sun and shimmering in a subtle beauty.  

      So I&#39;ll spare you the boring stuff that happened, and summarize 
what the evening was like.  We started off with a late lunch, and the 
chemistry was good.  We talked about family, relationships, what brought 
us to the convention.  Turned out that her situation wasn&#39;t too much 
unlike my own, except that it was her girlfriend that she had just 
broken up with, and it was a mutual thing rather than a &quot;Can&#39;t believe 
you ate out that whore on top of the issue where Captain America dies&quot; 
situation.  As we talked we figured out that in reality we only lived 
about an hour and a half away from one another, and while we didn&#39;t 
specifically mention anything about getting together later, it was 
somewhat implied.

      After the meal we hit the theater and saw Cloverfield.  And no, 
before you guess it, we didn&#39;t have sex at the movies.  For being a wild 
dyke, Karen was actually quite the gentleman.  While we watched she had 
an arm around my shoulders, and occasionally when our hands met in the 
popcorn bin she&#39;d stroke the back of my fingers with her thumb, and give 
me a wide, charming smile in the darkness.  The closest we got to any 
physical mischief in the theater was when she fed me a piece of 
chocolate from her candy bar, and I let my lips linger at her 
fingertips, kissing softly across them.

      It doesn&#39;t sound like much, but at the time it was the most 
sensual moment I could think of.

      Y&#39;see...it&#39;s been a while.  Even before things ended with my ex, 
they were going downhill.  Sex was a rarity, as was any indication that 
he even found me attractive.  It was nice to be out with someone that 
wanted me, that wanted to hold my hand, to cuddle into me, to every so 
often nudge my forehead with hers.  Several love-starved months can 
really make you appreciate it when someone gives you the attention 
you&#39;ve been yearning, and at that moment I was basically in heaven.

      Needless to say, I barely remember Cloverfield.  Not because my 
eyes weren&#39;t on it, but because I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about how great 
it was to be in Karen&#39;s arms.

      When the credits finally came up, I glanced at my wristwatch and 
saw that it was swiftly approaching seven.  Still not ready to stand up 
from Karen&#39;s arms I lingered there, and rolled my head back so that I 
could glance sideways at her handsome features.  She smiled, leaned 
down, and offered a tiny kiss to the edge of my nose.

      &quot;What do you want to do now, sweetheart?&quot;  Even with the noise of 
people leaving the theater all around me, her voice calling me by such a 
pet name was enough to make me shiver.  I known then I must&#39;ve blushed 
fiercely, because she took notice and began to trace my cheek with her 
fingertips.  I wasn&#39;t sure what to say in response, so I decided to 
simply follow my heart and say the one thing I had been thinking of all 
evening.

      &quot;Take me back to your hotel room?&quot;

      It sounded slutty, I guess, but it really wasn&#39;t meant to be.  
When I asked it, sex was the farthest thing from my mind.  Well...maybe 
not exactly the farthest, but it wasn&#39;t my main intention.  I just 
wanted her attention all to myself for the evening, no matter what we 
did.  Gazing up into those bright blue eyes, totally smitten, my 
attraction to her was undeniable.  She could take me back to her hotel 
and promptly fall asleep for all I cared, I could content myself with 
snuggling against her and listening to her breathe until I faintly fell 
asleep.

      Hey, this is a chick story.  Just because we had ridiculously 
kinky sex later doesn&#39;t mean that I can&#39;t also describe my deeply 
intimate adoration of her.

      Karen was pleased at my request, and she nodded once before 
dropping her head down to give me a tiny kiss on the lips.  It was brief 
and sweet, enough to show me her affection but not enough to get us into 
any more trouble.  When we stood up to leave she acted again as the 
perfect gentleman, holding my coat for me as I slipped it on, and 
holding my hand firmly but not tightly as we left. 

      Karen was staying at a similar hotel to mine, not as nice as where 
the convention was held, but not nearly the cesspool with the broken 
sign I saw as I was driving in.  The entire walk to it was made in 
silence as we moved hand-in-hand, both of us quiet in anticipation of 
what would come.  It wasn&#39;t until we were inside the elevator that one 
of us spoke, for when Karen slinked in close to wrap an arm around my 
waist, I moved to hold my head to her chest and listened to her softly 
speak.  Cuddled together in the first true privacy we had since the 
convention&#39;s bathroom, we were free to unabashedly hold each other, and 
relish in the intimacy.  She lowered her head into my hair, and I could 
feel her taking a deep breath of it before her soft pink lips opened to 
whisper.

      &quot;Mmm, Sammy...&quot;  Her voice was almost absorbed by the noise of the 
elevator as it began to rise, a deep, echoing metal creak.  She waited a 
moment until it found its groove, and then whispered some more into my 
strands of brown and pink hair.  &quot;You&#39;re gonna call me when the 
weekend&#39;s over, right?&quot;

      She said it with a tone that indicated a casual, free spirit, but 
I knew better.  As my head tilted to the side, her mouth began to drop, 
and soon I could hear the pause of breath and the faint licking of 
tongue to flesh on the outside of my earlobe.  A warm breath coursed 
down the length of my neck, and I trembled so hard that Karen had to 
tighten her arms around me to keep me up.  The first thing from my mouth 
was a simple gasp at the sensation, and then a low and subtle moan as I 
felt her tongue delicately tracing every contour of my ear.  As she made 
me melt yet again with her skills, I thought upon what she had asked.

      She sounded casual, sure.  But deep down there was concern.  The 
same concern I had.  The fear that when the weekend was over, so was 
this.  That it was just a one night stand.  She was trying to prepare 
herself, just in case she got home on Monday and the phone never rang.

      I couldn&#39;t help but giggle, even more charmed by Karen&#39;s 
nonchalant mask.  Even amidst insecurity and worry, she played it cool 
and calm, continuing to work my body like the heartthrob rebel of the 
fifties.  Those old movies where the guy with greased back hair and a 
handsome smile could make a girl faint just by giving her a certain 
look, Karen had them all beat.  She was scared.  And her hair wasn&#39;t 
greasy.  And even still, she managed to get the job done.

      With still-buckling knees (and a growing sense of, erm, let&#39;s say 
enthusiasm,) I tilted my head away from Karen&#39;s mouth, bringing my eyes 
to be in line with her own.  I could still feel a bit of moisture at the 
edge of my ear, just as I could see the bead of spit across her pale 
lips.  She was still giving me that look, through these hauntingly 
gorgeous eyes that seemed to make every inch of my flesh tingle in 
excitement.  Knowing her worry, knowing her fear, I did my best to 
console her of what she was too proud to admit.

      My lips drew near, and I gave her a tiny peck, just barely enough 
to collect the drop of moisture at the cusp of her flesh.  My tongue 
peeked out to collect the droplet, and I gave her a smile as warm as I 
could muster.  Then, well...

      I&#39;m not proud of this, okay?  It sounds really sappy, it sounds 
over-romantic, and trust me, it sounds a lot better when you&#39;re in that 
situation.  That&#39;s how it goes, damnit!  You ever tell someone they&#39;re 
the sunshine and rain to you?  You KNOW it sounds ludicrously goofy, but 
you say it because it sounds good at the time.  She had just asked 
&quot;You&#39;re gonna call me when the weekend&#39;s over, right?&quot;  And that&#39;s why I 
said this, as Karen looked at me with masked worry and unmasked hope;

      &quot;I&#39;m gonna call you my girlfriend when the weekend&#39;s over.&quot;

      To this day, she still teases me about what a lame line it was.  
But you know what?  Bitch didn&#39;t think it was lame back then!

      I could almost instantly feel her arms tighten around me, and in 
response my own squeezed her back.  Our faces drew closer as Karen&#39;s 
beautiful, extra wide smile erupted in a shining wall of perfectly white 
teeth.  She giggled deep inside her throat in an almost stupid-sounding 
chuckle, for it was mixed with equal portions of happiness, arousal, and 
excitement.  Her joyful noises weren&#39;t alone, I certainly made plenty of 
my own, including giggling so hard I hiccupped.

      Kinda embarrassing, but whatever.

      The elevator finally reached its destination and we darted out, 
holding each other&#39;s hand as we practically ran to the end of the hall 
where Karen&#39;s room was.  While she fumbled with the key I stood behind 
her, hands on her shoulders and lips on the back of her slender neck, 
standing on my tiptoes to make it a reachable height.  An unlocking 
noise later and we were inside, a split second afterwards a &quot;Do not 
disturb&quot; sign was thrown upon the door, and it slammed shut with a heavy 
crash.

      And what happened after is between me and her, dear reader. 

      ... 

      ... 

      ... 

      Ha!  Just kidding.  Gotcha!  

      The hotel room was pitch black when we slipped inside, and as we 
stumbled inside Karen struck the bathroom light, one of those weird 
setups where the light is outside of the bathroom itself.  It allowed 
for a dim light to slip into must&#39;ve the room, adding an atmosphere not 
unlike that which a few perfectly placed candles would give.  Looking to 
the side I saw Karen&#39;s dirty clothes in a corner, beside a few bits and 
pieces of her costume that she had worn to the convention.  A freshly 
made bed with a mint on the pillow told of a maid&#39;s visit, but an empty 
soda can on the nightstand told me she hadn&#39;t done a thorough job of 
cleaning.

      We slipped inside with me right behind Karen, and I wrapped an arm 
around her slender waist to help hold her in close against me.  Before I 
even knew what I was doing, my hand had slipped underneath her shirt, 
and I felt my fingers brushing up against her perfectly trim tummy, 
sliding back and forth against that lovely pale skin.  There was a 
moment where she savored it; I could tell.  Despite the sexual energy in 
the air, we both gave ourselves the moment to enjoy the tender 
sweetness, a few seconds where I stroked her stomach and smelled her 
hair while she closed her eyes and lavished in the attention.

      The moment of sweetness melded gradually with less innocent 
desires, and I could feel my body giving way to the urges I had felt all 
day long.  My face was no longer keeping my nose nearby to smell her 
hair; instead it had dropped down so that my lips could begin kissing 
along her back, any flesh that the collar of her short was shy of 
hiding.  I still stood on my tiptoes to do so, one hand braced on her 
waist for balance, the other still underneath her shirt.  It wasn&#39;t 
satisfied by stroking her stomach anymore, though!  My fingers had 
become hungry, and they were keeping my new lover guessing by 
occasionally slipping to the extremes of the north and south of her 
body.  First, past her stomach and towards her chest, where they just 
barely stroked across the bottom fabric of her bra.  Then down in a 
swift motion, enough to stick my fingertips just underneath the rim of 
her jeans.  With each motion she gave a tiny gasp, her body aware of 
where it wanted to be touched; everywhere.  Before long her knees had 
buckled so that we stood on a closer level, and she leaned her head back 
to rest it upon my shoulder.

      I enjoyed this.  With my old boyfriend, I never got to be the 
&quot;dominant&quot; one.  I&#39;d play the femme role and let him do his thing, and 
god forbid if I tried to be the one to instigate things.  Now, with this 
gorgeous thing in my arms, leaning behind me, writhing under my 
touch...I was finally in control.

      Her head tilted and looked sideways at me, and the desperate 
pursing of her lips told me she wanted a kiss.  I teased her with it, 
dipping my head in to gently brush our lips together, only to swiftly 
pull away and leave her gasping in frustrated torment.  Once again, and 
her mouth still fell for it.  It wasn&#39;t until she gave a pitiful whine 
and reached a hand back into my brown and pink hair that I finally gave 
her what she required, and with her hand in my hair guiding my actions, 
I moved in to fiercely kiss her.

      There was no sweet and subtle kisses, no gentle pecks around the 
area.  It was primal, and it was pure.  My tongue darted into her mouth 
and immediately struck hers, and we both shared a moan that made our 
lips tremble from vibration.  God, she tasted good.  Sweet and 
addicting.  Our eyes closed and we whimpered from the sensations, deeply 
kissing each other with all of our frustrations fading away.

      My ex liked to hide porn on his computer from me.  Sometimes I&#39;d 
snoop, and I&#39;d see a lot of the girl/girl stuff he had.  They kissed so 
dainty.  Tiny pecks, closed lipped, so obvious that they didn&#39;t want to 
be doing it.  Obvious that it was just a show.  I had wondered a lot 
back then what I would&#39;ve kissed another girl like, what my own style 
would be.

      Well, at the time...it was sloppy and wild.  It was wet and noisy 
and deep and uncontrolled, and with each breath we took mid-kiss it only 
became moreso.  I could feel her breath upon my face, chilling the marks 
of spit that had collected here and there across my cheeks, and I knew 
that she felt the same sensation by the moans she was starting to make.  
Unable to maintain full control of my body, my hands started to take 
matters into themselves, and soon I felt too fleshy orbs inside my 
palms.  I was squeezing them, and she was singing in cries and whimpers 
and gasps.

      The fabric of her shirt was tossed aside after the kiss, and Karen 
was tossed to the bed.  She looked like a Gap model.  Thin, blonde, and 
wearing nothing but jeans and a bra.  While she stretched back and gave 
me a wagging finger motion to come to her, I worked at my own clothing, 
eager to get off all I could.  While my feet worked to kick off my 
sneakers my hands were busy at my jeans, fumbling with the button as if 
it had suddenly become a combination lock.  When I caught a sight of 
those gorgeous eyes of hers; however, there was no time to remember the 
combination numbers.

      I shoved the jeans down without unbuttoning them, hooking my 
thumbs into the waistband of my panties on the way down so I could kill 
two birds with one stone.  My oversized T-shirt fell over anything 
revealing, and as soon as the jeans were at the floor I charged ahead to 
join Karen in bed.

      Tackling atop her, I snatched her into my arms and kissed her as 
passionately as I ever kissed my ex.  Moaning and desperate my mouth 
fell on hers, and we eagerly shared each other as we had been doing all 
day long.  Her hands were inside my shirt, stroking my back and nipping 
at the straps of my bra, and mine were in her hair, holding the back of 
her neck, making sure that she couldn&#39;t escape my deep and lusting kiss.

      My knees suddenly buckled and I nearly slipped in the kiss when I 
felt her touch me someplace very sensitive.  My body alive with a 
pleasure I hadn&#39;t known since earlier in the day, my eyes shot open and 
I looked into the piercing color of Karen&#39;s own.  They were shining with 
mischievous delight, and as our kiss faded our foreheads met, so that 
she could stare into my eyes while her hand below started to play.

      One of her palms had nestled against my pussy, palming it like she 
was holding a handful of water.  Her fingertips were sliding back and 
forth at the very bottom of it, while the heel of her palm mashed gently 
into the top.  I grit my teeth with a manic grin as I gazed at my new 
lover, and the look she gave me was enough to make anyone; man or woman, 
melt.

      &quot;I wish I brought my toys...&quot;  She whispered, and placed a kiss on 
my cheek, just at the corner of my lips.  Her voice was deep and hoarse, 
an aroused whisper only meant for those lucky enough to spend a night 
with her.  &quot;I&#39;d wear my strap-on and fuck this pussy raw...&quot;

      She was making me incredibly wet.  This woman knew how to read my 
body like a book, the way she touched me, the way she talked to me.  My 
mind flashed back to how she coaxed me into screaming in the public 
bathroom stall, and how my body had gone so mad with pleasure I would&#39;ve 
done anything she commanded.  Now with the mental image of her wearing a 
toy and taking me harder than my ex ever did...well, I was very quickly 
finding myself falling into the same pit of uncontrolled arousal.  My 
hands fell on her shoulders and my fingernails dug into her flesh, which 
made her give a cat-like yowl of delight.

      There I knelt on the bed, rocking back and forth in place, 
creating a tiny pool of moisture into Karen&#39;s hand.  Every now and again 
a finger would &quot;slip&quot; and end up inside of me, but she kept these teases 
to a minimal, and each time placated me with another fierce and messy 
kiss.

      I dropped my hands down, and clawed the bra away from her tiny 
breasts, sending the garment soaring across the room to strike the hotel 
window.  I gazed down with a hungry look, and before I could stop myself 
a nipple was within my lips, and my tongue was battering down on it with 
a relentless, merciless fury.  Her breasts were so tiny that it was 
difficult to get a full fist of them, but I made due by slipping my hand 
underneath each with my palms flat against her abdomen, pushing them up 
and into my slobbering mouth.

      By now the room was filled with our noises, mixed moans coming 
from two young women who needed each other in a sexual desperation.  As 
our foreplay continued other garments were thrown aside, including 
Karen&#39;s jeans, her panties, and my shirt and bra.  In a matter of 
minutes we went to nothing but socks, naked and hot and rolled up in a 
filthy hotel blanket.

      I was on my back now with Karen atop me, and my arms were wrapped 
tightly around her waist with each hand planted on a cheek of her rump.  
She giggled with delight as I squeezed and dug in my nails, and she made 
me squirm with ravenous licks and nibbles across my breasts.  Mine were 
much bigger than hers so she had plenty of room to work with, and that 
wide smile of hers found a worthwhile purpose wrapped around one of my 
stiffened nipples.  My head bucked back with brown and pink hair 
whipping around, and my hips arched as I gave a cry of eager passion.  
Every now and again she&#39;d suckle just the right way, with the fingers of 
her other hand stroking the perfect spot on my flesh, and it&#39;d cause 
another wild buck from my body.  Our legs danced together, entwining and 
squeezing and rubbing, and every now and again I gave Karen&#39;s ass a firm 
squeeze to let her know I hadn&#39;t forgotten about it.

      Karen was tall and skinny, so it was easy for her to maneuver even 
inside of the tight wrap of blanket we found ourselves in.  When she 
left my breasts and began to move I was initially disappointed, but when 
I saw what she had in mind all of my worries were quickly put to rest.  
Karen&#39;s upper half had disappeared underneath the blanket, and just as I 
felt her breath against the lower half of my stomach, her lovely hips 
were coming in towards my face.  Before I could speak a word of support 
or protest she had brought her knees down at either side of my shoulder, 
and a beautiful, sweet smelling mound was lowered onto my lips.

      Never had I done anything like this, but in that moment I was 
simply swept up into the passion.  Hungrily my face lunged for her 
valley, and I began by forcing my tongue through the folds near the top, 
eager to lick the brass ring of her excitement.  Once I found the nub 
amidst the layers of lovely pale pink, I battered it ferociously with my 
tongue while pursing with my lips, giving it a slow sucking as I so 
fervently lashed it.  I could hear muffled moans from inside the rolled 
up blanket, just as the touch of her large hands spread out across my 
inner thighs.  I paused in my licking, and my breath caught in 
anticipation of what came next.

      When I felt her tongue first touch my clit, I thought I was going 
to scream forever.  My hips bucked from the affection and I thrashed 
violently around, her tongue had touched me so teasingly and delicately 
that it made my entire body ache.  My scream was soon muffled though, 
for my little Karen seemed to be impatient and had forcibly lowered her 
moistening pussy down on my face.  My world quickly became her juice, 
her flesh, and I couldn&#39;t be happier.  Tongue lashing wildly I covered 
as much area as I could, nowhere near the delicate touch she was taking 
with mine.  If it tasted like Karen, I wanted to lick it as much and as 
hard as possible, and to that extent my lover was thoroughly enjoying 
it.

      On paper, it wasn&#39;t an equal lovemaking session.  For every minute 
of almost violent devouring that I performed on her, I&#39;d be rewarded 
with a lick, or a tap, or a faint kiss on the very edge of my lips.  
Doesn&#39;t quite seem fair, does it?

      In truth, it was more than fair.  Karen touched and licked with 
such precision that I wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if she spent those 
minutes studying my body, analyzing where the perfect spot to touch me 
was.  She couldn&#39;t have simply guessed, for each lick was like she had a 
radar to my body, each one made my muscles jerk and convulse like I was 
being electrocuted.  So the only answer HAD to be that she spent those 
long, touchless minutes studying.

      Well, studying and screaming.  For as much as I enjoyed her, I&#39;ll 
be damned if she didn&#39;t enjoy me.

      We were two different entities.  Slow and precise versus wild and 
passionate.  Perfectly serving each other, one flailing and the other 
focusing, filling more needs than we even knew we had.  With every 
second of my rampant licking Karen&#39;s pussy grew more wet, and before 
long my mouth was simply a mess of fluid, lines of her nectar running 
down my cheeks in dozens of small streams.  And conversely, with every 
pinpoint touch she delivered to me I felt my own floodgates straining.  
Hairline cracks were appearing in my dam, and each bit of pressure made 
the structure more unsound.  Hers was a steady season&#39;s worth of 
rainfall.  Mine was a building flood.  

      Speaking of liquid and spit and cum juice and wet things, there&#39;s 
something very tactile in these moments I never see anyone write about.  
Sweat.  Karen was latched onto me in a sixty-nine, half of her 
underneath the blanket we were tightly encased in.  She was sweating 
like mad from the heat and the excitement, and I was certainly doing my 
fair share.  It&#39;s so erotic, two glistening and moist bodies clinging to 
one another.  Every time my hand would cross over her waist, and I&#39;d 
feel the faint sliding tendency thanks to how slick our bodies 
were...well, there was something oddly intimate about it that made me 
even more excited.  

      So there we were.  Entwined, soaking wet both outside and in, 
screaming amidst muffled barriers.  It wouldn&#39;t be long before we both 
finally exploded, and it was Karen to first vocalize those thoughts.  I 
heard her cry from underneath the covers, a shattering pulse of 
delightful voice that destroyed any doubts I had that Karen was enjoying 
the pleasure I gave her.

      &quot;Oh, Godfuckdamnit!&quot;  As she shouted her body suddenly convulsed, 
and I felt her muscles tighten and convulse around my face.  For a 
moment it became very hard, but very very enjoyable, to breathe.  Almost 
suffocated in her intoxicating smell, I thrashed around in rapturous joy 
as Karen came by means of my attention.  It was a wet orgasm, sloppy and 
sweet and delicious.  As I felt her flavor smearing across my face, 
soaking into everything from my tongue to my hair to my pores, I knew 
there was no way I could become more of a part of her.  It was enough to 
make me burst, as well.

      Well...that, and the sudden bite.  Right after Karen shouted she 
jerked her head forward, and I felt her teeth sink deep into the inside 
of my right thigh.  It hurt like hell, but in a visceral, sexually 
delightful fashion.  When I felt my skin being so tightly pinched 
between her teeth, and two of those slender flingers slide almost 
instantly inside of me...there was no holding back.

      I came like a goddamn freight train.

      If I yelled something, I don&#39;t remember what it was.  Probably 
some incomprehensible stream of flashing random words laced with 
vulgarity, like &quot;Fuck chair cunt chute cum cellphone.&quot;  To this day, 
Karen insists that I shouted that I loved her then and there.  I totally 
don&#39;t remember it, but who the hell knows?  Not to ruin the ending, but 
I&#39;ve told Karen I love her a thousand times since then, several hundred 
of those taking place mid orgasm.  Maybe she&#39;s just confusing it with 
when we fucked on a Skeeball lane a few weeks ago, or maybe I really did 
lay all my cards on the table that quickly.  I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.

      I love her now, and I loved her that first night.  

      And for the record, I hosed her down like she was a peace rally 
protestor and I wasn&#39;t cleared for lethal force.  Some of it she 
swallowed up, some of it soaked her hair, some of it became the wet spot 
she forced me to sleep on that night.  What can I say?  When it&#39;s been a 
while since you&#39;ve been touched by someone that knows how to do it, some 
orgasms can just knock your fucking head off.

      And that&#39;s about it!  After we laid there in that position for a 
few minutes, recovering from what we had just done, Karen finally swung 
her sweaty body around so that we could lay stomach to stomach once 
more.  She rested on top of me and put her head on my shoulder, and I 
felt myself instinctually holding my arms around her waist, assuming the 
role of the masculine one in the romance.  A few kisses, whisper faint 
and delicate, and then a few shared quiet words to help solidfy the 
sudden sweetness in our post-orgasmic bliss.

      &quot;Sweet dreams, Karen.&quot;

      &quot;Good night, Sammy.&quot; 

      Her words must&#39;ve been enchanted, because they&#39;ve all been good 
ever since.
