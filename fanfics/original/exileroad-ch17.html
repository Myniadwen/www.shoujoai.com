onto the river plain with a telescope, &quot;the bastard is
really doing it.&quot; She passed the device over to
Laur&#39;ien, their mistress having already taken a look.

&quot;How many do you think?&quot; the Dutchess Jantha asked,
her blonde hair glittering as she looked at her close
friend and bodyguard.

&quot;At least a thousand men encamped on the river plane
outside the city,&quot; Midori frowned, her short black
hair falling forward as she scowled down at the city
bellow them, &quot;and if what I saw in the hills is
accurate, more troops are coming.&quot;

&quot;Is the king of Xiang a total fool?&quot; Laur&#39;ien
wondered, the tawny haired woman warrior sweeping the
looking glass over their assembled foes, &quot;He knows
that Edo is just waiting for a sign of weakness to
strike!&quot;

Jantha sighed, &quot;A fool he may very well be.&quot; She drew
her cloak around her to ward off a chill as they left
the battlements, &quot;He deludes himself into thinking he
can take us quickly, then just refortify his eastern
border.&quot;

&quot;Midori,&quot; Laur&#39;ien looked at her as they passed into
the dark hallway within the wall, &quot;what do you think
Edo will do?&quot;

&#39;Indeed,&#39; Jantha thought, peering at the handsome
woman&#39;s profile in the torchlight, &#39;I&#39;d pay to know
what you&#39;re thinking.&#39;

&quot;The Shogun probably already has forces on their
boarder ready to move out,&quot; Midori said, opening the
door ahead of them and warily checking both ways
before they moved on, &quot;they&#39;ll move out quickly, drive
into Xiang and grab as much land as they can hold or
until they hit something tough enough to stop them...&quot;

Jantha paused as they went down another set of stairs
as she thoughtfully said, &quot;Xiang isn&#39;t terribly well
known for it&#39;s fortifications or even construction...
there&#39;s not much there to stop the Empire of Edo.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Midori agreed with her grimly, &quot;but until
he notices Edo is invading, we&#39;re stuck with him.&quot;

Laur&#39;ien looked amused, &quot;And as a messenger has to get
over a mountain from eastern Xiang to here, it could
be awhile.&quot;

They descended again, reaching the ground level as
restless guards nodded to them worriedly. Commander
Hudson strode up with a grim look on his face, &quot;Why
were you up on the walls? It&#39;s dangerous.&quot;

&quot;Good to see you too, commander,&quot; Jantha looked
amused.

Hudson actually blushed, &quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;Sorry, sir,&quot; Laur&#39;ien looked a little sheepish, &quot;she
threatened to go up there alone if we didn&#39;t
cooperate.&quot;

Midori looked thoughtful, &quot;An&#39; I rather thought Queen
Gwen&#39;d be upset if I knocked her out with my staff.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Jantha turned to look at Midori
indignantly.

Midori gave her a steady glance as she said, &quot;If I
thought it was needed to save yer life? Yes, I would.&quot;

Hudson cleared his throat, &quot;Ladies, could we please
get back to the palace? The Queen wants to seal the
city...&quot;

&quot;That might be unhealthy for the homes and businesses
outside the walls,&quot; Jantha noted with a deadpan
expression.

&quot;Too bad there&#39;s no way we can hold the whole city,&quot;
Laur&#39;ien said pointedly, &quot;our defensive line would be
unacceptably thin.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to be hard stretched to defend as it is,&quot;
Hudson said with a sigh.

As a group they hurried through the streets, the city
filled with the usual business along with a certain
amount of panicked preperation. While the initial
arrival of troops a few weeks ago had been taken
rather calmly, the rapidly building forces had begun
to fill the people with fear. Now people were fleeing
up and down the coast or away by boat, not considering
what would happen if the city did fall.

The palace itself was busy as nobles hurried to and
fro, more than the usual numbers watching things with
steely eyes. They were led past the throne room to one
of the private meeting rooms, where they were ushered
in with a certain degree of bowing and scraping.

Gwen turned from where she had been waiting by the
fireplace, the flames providing a cheery note to the
usually dank room. &quot;Took you long enough,&quot; Gwen said
crossly, but then the green clad blonde hugged her
cousin.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Jantha hugged her back even as she took in
the others in the room.

Taking up a position by Jantha&#39;s seat, Midori swept
the room with her eyes. Richard, the Queen&#39;s viceroy
and confidant sat in one chair, Hudson and another
officer took two, Jantha another and surprisingly the
Countess Hazan was there, the black haired woman
dressed as usual in her men&#39;s trousers and a matching
shirt, while her lover Ra&#39;hel sat beside her, dressed
as innocently as the former streetwalker could manage.

&quot;Countess,&quot; Jantha nodded to her, a bit of frost in
her tone as she tucked her dress under her and sat
down.

Hazan&#39;s smile was wry as she looked across the table
at her, &quot;Hello, Duchess. Nice to see you looking so
well.&quot;

&quot;Lieutenant,&quot; Laur&#39;ien nodded to the intense looking
redhead beside the commander.

The woman smiled suddenly, softening her appearance a
great deal as she said, &quot;I thought I asked you to call
me Jo.&quot;

&#39;Well ain&#39;t that interesting,&#39; Midori thought.

&quot;Midori, Laur&#39;ien, you don&#39;t need to hover,&quot; Gwen said
briskly as she sat down at the head of the table,
&quot;there are chairs for you too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather stand,&quot; Midori said, &quot;just in case.&quot;

Gwen gave her a withering look, &quot;And I&#39;d rather not
tilt my head to speak to you.&quot; She pointed forcefully,
&quot;Sit!&quot;

&quot;Aye, my Queen,&quot; Midori conceded as she sat.

&quot;Roll over,&quot; Laur&#39;ien muttered, &quot;play dead.&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Midori scowled.

Gwen hid a smile, then forcefully brought her mind
back on business. &quot;Commander,&quot; she turned to him,
&quot;what&#39;s the state of the army?&quot;

&quot;Much less than I&#39;d like,&quot; Hudson admitted, &quot;the
Queen&#39;s guard numbers less than a thousand, and we&#39;re
having difficulty mustering the personal guards of the
noblemen in the city and beyond.&quot;

&quot;No one wants to surrender any troops in case the
capital falls and they have to fend for themselves,&quot;
Jantha mused.

Richard looked pained as he said, &quot;But if they don&#39;t
surrender their troops to our defense, we&#39;re more
likely to fall.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Gwen growled. 

Hazan smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;ll put my associates in noble
circles to work, they may be able to pry some troops
loose.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d appreciate it,&quot; Jo said as she studied
documents. &quot;We&#39;ve already tentatively contacted the
mercenary guild, with their assistance we can muster a
additional three hundred troops,&quot; she reported.

&quot;My budget,&quot; Richard winced.

&quot;They won&#39;t fleece you too bad,&quot; Midori noted, &quot;their
lives are on the line, too.&quot; She looked at Hazan, &quot;You
might want to get together your female swordswomen
too.&quot;

&quot;Do our best,&quot; Ra&#39;hel nodded gravely, taking notes for
her lover.

&quot;Is it worth the trouble to arm the common people?&quot;
Laur&#39;ien wondered, looking first at Gwen then over at
Hudson and Jo.

&quot;Former soldiers, maybe,&quot; Gwen mused.

Hudson nodded grimly, &quot;Or merchants with fighting
experience. My experiences with untrained fighters in
battle haven&#39;t been good ones.&quot;

&quot;A pike is a relatively forgiving weapon,&quot; Midori
noted thoughtfully, &quot;if they come at the walls, I&#39;d
not mind a few volunteers with them on the walls.&quot;

Jo made a note, &quot;Good point. I&#39;ll have to see what we
have in stock...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to say I have no guards,&quot; Jantha sighed,
&quot;or I&#39;d donate them to the cause.&quot;

Midori found herself wondering why Jantha didn&#39;t have
guards, but resolved to ask later. &quot;Are we going to
launch attacks against his forces,&quot; she asked, &quot;or is
this going to be a purely defensive action?&quot;

&quot;Attack,&quot; Hudson started to say...

...even as Gwen said firmly, &quot;Defensive.&quot; She and
Hudson looked at each other as she continued, &quot;Once
the king discovers his kingdom is being chewed up by
Edo, he&#39;ll go back to defend it. We just have to hold
out till he goes.&quot;

&quot;Or,&quot; Hudson sounded oddly grandfatherly, &quot;he might
gamble on taking us and trying to hold off Edo&#39;s army
from here.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Richard sighed, &quot;I need a drink.&quot;

&quot;I too,&quot; Laur&#39;ien agreed.

&quot;No drinking on duty,&quot; Jo chided.

Laur&#39;ien gave her a charming smile as she added, &quot;I
said I needed one, not that I was going to have one.&quot;
