<h1>LoveStruck (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jpoulos.html">Jennifer Poulos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/lovestruck-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Dawn found Heart awake, the first grey wisps of morning flowing in 
around the heavy velvet curtains.

Sunrise! She thought excitedly. That was enough to prompt her out of 
bed. She grabbed her glasses off the bedside table and hurried to the 
window. She peeked around the curtain, grateful their room was high 
enough above the surrounding buildings to allow her to see the sun rise. 
She watched happily as the huge orange orb crept slowly into the sky, 
glistening off the glass buildings and lighting the city with a warm 
ethereal flame. It washed the city with a copper glow and the promise of 
a bright new day.

Filled with euphoria at the beautiful sight, Heart watched until the 
copper faded to the plain light of day, then let the curtain fall, 
plunging the room into twilight again. She turned and sat on the small 
couch to look through the assortment of magazines the hotel had 
provided. She found a few that contained listings of places to go for 
entertainment, and her mind reeled at the myriad of plays, museums, 
night clubs, and fancy restaurants this city had to offer. She couldn&#39;t 
wait till Seraph awoke so they could go and do all these things 
together.

She looked to the bed where Seraph still lay sleeping. Her pale skin 
seemed to be still fresh and glowing from the night before. Her wings 
sprawled off the bed, their tips nearly spanning the room. Her tail 
trailed off the end of the bed, its tip twitching with her dreams. Her 
long legs were curled slightly to one side, offering only a small 
glimpse of the curly white locks that crowned her pubis, and her 
delicate purple hooves poked out from the tangle of sheets around the 
end of the bed. One of her long-nailed hands rested on one of her 
generous breasts, the other dangling off the side of the bed. Her long 
hair made a pale corona around her head, accenting the small curved 
horns on her temples. Her full, red lips were parted just slightly, her 
elongated canines shaping her lower lip into a small pout. A look of 
utter peace graced her face, giving her a glow that spoke of 
contentment.

Heart was enraptured. Seraph was so beautiful when she was sleeping. 
Heart watched her for almost an hour as she tossed and purred, small 
noises of pleasure reminiscent of their previous night escaping her now 
and then.

At a murmured &quot;Mmmmmm... Heart....&quot; from the still-sleeping succubus, 
Heart smiled, her entire body filling and swelling with a warm sensation 
that flowed from inside out. Seraph even dreamed about her...

She reflected on the activities of the night before, the sheer joy of 
feeling Seraph&#39;s love flowing from her, filling her, the rush of passion 
that had burned through her, the pleasures of sharing that passion with 
Seraph, the ecstasies of feeling her feed. Heart&#39;s eyes teared at the 
awesome power their lovemaking had released. Her emotions, her heart, 
and her soul were singing a song sweeter than ten thousand hosannas. How 
could she ever have believed something so glorious was wrong?

Finally, she was unable to gaze at Seraph anymore without an 
overwhelming urge to wake her and renew their activities. She stretched; 
reveling in the ways Seraph had made her body feel, then turned to the 
TV, looking for a distraction. She pushed her glasses back up her nose 
as she flipped the channels, her face souring at the sight of all the 
violence, the gratuitous sex, and the constant promises of instant 
gratification and indulgence. It was all so overwhelmingly 
sensationalist. Where was the love?

Then she found a movie about angels. She was mildly disturbed at the 
black trench-coats they all wore, but she smiled happily as they all 
gathered to watch the sunrise, just as she had. However, when the 
Angelic main character fell in love with a human, her heart went out to 
him. It was so like her and Seraph. Then, when in the movie, he fell, 
she couldn&#39;t bear it any more, she turned off the TV, tears in her eyes. 
Why was love a crime?

Then her eyes fell on the white purse that contained all her 
belongings...

Until then, she&#39;d been able to forget that she&#39;d Fallen, had managed to 
push it all to the back of her mind and ignore it, but the sight of the 
purse, and the knowledge of what was in it combined with the movie 
brought it all crashing down like a bludgeon. Numbly, she sat on the 
couch and began to pull out the mementos of the life she had lost...

Her harp was the first thing she placed on the small table before the 
couch, an ancient instrument of Greek design. It had been crafted for 
her by one of her first assignments as a young Guardian Angel. Demetrius 
had been a master harp maker, enslaved to a Roman Patrician in the first 
century. He&#39;d converted to Christianity and, fresh out of the academy, 
Heart had been assigned to guide and guard him. She&#39;d never known he 
could see her until she was playing one day and he had whispered &quot;Your 
song would shame even the Muses...&quot;

He&#39;d spent a decade crafting a harp he felt worthy of her, a gift he had 
carried all the way to Heaven to give her on the day he&#39;d died, a thank 
you for all she had done to free his spirit, if not his body...

How many countless days had she sat on a cloud in the centuries since, 
playing it softly and gazing down at the planet she cared so much for?

A small music box came next, a memento of a Swiss clock maker she had 
comforted following the loss of his son. The intricate mechanism played 
nearly a minute of the Moonlight Sonata on tiny chimes. Then came a 
necklace of polished glass beads with a crudely carved figure of an 
angel in a crude wooden box. A small scrap of paper inside the box bore 
the words &quot;For Heart, my best friend&quot; in a childish eight-year-old 
scrawl. Despite the hardships an orphan had to face in Victorian 
England, Reggie had never given up that bright spark of hope that let 
him face every day with a smile. The day he&#39;d been adopted by a loving 
family had been one of the proudest moments of her life...

Then came the small carefully rendered portrait... a memory of one of 
her toughest assignments. She remembered Michelangelo De Caravaggio 
well: an angry young man who saw only a world of hate and violence. All 
of his paintings of people reflected this chaos, but his beautiful still 
lifes had been full of bright promise, with apples so real you could 
taste the juice, and flowers so bright you could detect their perfumed 
scent from the oil and medium. The man had loved nothing but his art, 
and in a tortured time, it had been all she could do to keep him 
painting, to keep him telling the stories of the Son of God and his 
Angels, Saints, and Martyrs.

Still, in the end, he had died young and alone on a beach. Heart had 
been there, watching as Abaddoniel&#39;s angels had come and taken him, 
holding the small portrait of her he had done... Like Demetrius, he had 
had the Sight.

She shook her head as she put the master work aside. She&#39;d once 
considered her guidance to the angry youth a success. Now it was... 
what? A success? A failure? Or just another meaningless chapter in a 
pointless existence? Two thousand years of service in the name of Love 
and for what? To be told that she didn&#39;t know what Love truly was? She 
pulled several more items from the bag as she thought: her spare halo, a 
jar of polish, some soft polishing cloths...

When she pulled out the long stiff-bristled brush, she could control it 
no longer. The tears came unbidden, choking her. She collapsed on the 
floor, her tears flowing freely, the weight of all that had been taken 
from her crushing her...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Seraph woke up to an empty bed in a strange room. Noting that that was 
nothing unusual, she stretched, basking in the afterglow of the night 
before...

Heart!

She sat bolt upright and for a panicked moment couldn&#39;t find her angel, 
her beautiful Beloved. She felt a tight knot in her stomach &#151; had she 
slept through an attack? She checked the bed and the bathroom for 
Heart... or worse, the telltale signs of brimstone burns...

...But the faint glistening of silver light by the window, nearly 
drowned by the sunlight leaking into the room around the curtain, drew 
her attention. She went to investigate.

Heart&#39;s halo glowed as bright as it ever had, but the angel herself was 
in a dark mood, tears streaming down her rounded cheeks. By her hand was 
a large flat brush, apparently dropped in her anguish. Only its long 
bristles kept Seraph from mistaking it for a scrub brush. Thinking to 
comfort her love, Seraph sat and cradled Heart to her breast, combing 
her hair to calm her. &quot;Oh, Beloved, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Heart&#39;s only response was a renewal of heart-wrenching sobs. Seraph 
dropped the brush and held the angel tight. &quot;My Heart. What is it? 
What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she whispered, concern clear in her voice. Tears streamed 
down her face. &quot;Beloved, what did I do to upset you so?&quot;

It took Heart a few minutes to catch her breath and calm down enough to 
answer. Her voice was a barely audible squeak. &quot;That w-was m-m-my 
fuh-fuh-feather brush!&quot;

The terrible realization of what that meant to the wingless angel 
combined with the complete absence of any joy in Heart&#39;s eyes crushed 
Seraph, her emotions spiraling down like the fresh stream of tears on 
her face.

They held each other as they cried for the angel&#39;s loss, comforting each 
other as only the presence of a loved one can. Long moments passed 
before the tears quieted and Seraph whispered, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Beloved... I 
didn&#39;t know... My beautiful angel...&quot;

&quot;Am I? How can I be an angel anymore, Beloved? I&#39;ve Fallen...&quot;

Something within Seraph rebelled. &quot;That&#39;s not true!&quot; she said intensely. 
&quot;They may be able to take your wings and exile you to the Mortal Plane, 
but they can&#39;t force you to Fall! They can&#39;t take what makes you an 
angel: Your warmth, the purity of your soul, your compassion, your love! 
That&#39;s what makes you an angel, Heart, your love! You love, Heart, so 
much you even gave your love to a succubus like me.&quot; Seraph reached up 
to touch Heart&#39;s halo. &quot;You are the truest angel of Love I&#39;ve ever seen, 
Beloved. And if showing me how to love isn&#39;t an indication, what&#39;s 
this?&quot; She pulled Heart&#39;s halo down in front of her nose. &quot;Or this!&quot; She 
held up Heart&#39;s harp as the angel straightened her halo. &quot;Or even this!&quot; 
She snagged the first thing that came to her hand &#151; a jar. She looked at 
it in puzzlement for a second, then opened it and took a whiff. She 
closed the lid hurriedly as her eyes watered and tossed it to Heart. 
&quot;What IS that?&quot;

Heart couldn&#39;t help herself; she giggled. Seraph&#39;s vehemence in 
defending her had lifted her spirits, having her halo pulled in front of 
her nose had made her smile, and the wrinkled face Seraph had given the 
jar made her laugh, her nose crinkling as her cheeks gathered in a broad 
smile.

&quot;It&#39;s Halo Polish,&quot; Heart said as she giggled. She took a cloth from the 
table and dipped it in the polish, then took her halo off. &quot;All that 
nasty psychic residue of evil tarnishes halos and turns them black.&quot; She 
showed Seraph a few small smudges. &quot;Halos do need to be polished every 
so often.&quot;

Seraph looked horrified. &quot;Oh, no! I smudged it!&quot;

Heart laughed. &quot;No, silly! Those demons you fought did.&quot; She took 
Seraph&#39;s hand and laid it on the halo. &quot;See? You can&#39;t smudge it, 
Beloved. You love me.&quot; Heart smiled her crinkly grin again. Seraph was 
happy to see it. Heart only gave that smile when she was really happy. 
But there was one small problem...

&quot;I&#39;m so glad I didn&#39;t smudge it, Beloved, but could you please do me a 
favor?&quot;

&quot;Anything, Beloved.&quot;

&quot;Could you please put your halo back on?&quot; Seraph&#39;s voice was so 
plaintive that Heart had to laugh as she complied.

&quot;Is that better?&quot;

&quot;Much!&quot; Seraph said as she gave Heart a quick hug. &quot;You look naked 
without it.&quot;

&quot;Silly! I am naked,&quot; Heart giggled.

&quot;Not like that.&quot;

Heart understood, and her heart soared. Seraph could make her feel like 
an angel, halo or not, but if it made her happy...

Seraph looked at the table. &quot;What&#39;s this other stuff?&quot;

Heart took Seraph on a grand tour of the contents of her purse, telling 
the stories of each item as she pulled it from the bag. Seraph listened 
raptly, her eyes shining with pride as Heart told her about her various 
assignments.

Finally, Heart had all her belongings out of the bag and spread out on 
the table, two thousand years of gifts and memories.

Seraph hooked a long fingernail into the top of the bag. &quot;Anything else 
in here?&quot; she asked as she peeked in the top.

&quot;There shouldn&#39;t be...&quot; Heart shrugged as Seraph stuck her arm in up to 
the shoulder, her tongue sticking out one side of her mouth in 
concentration as she searched the enormous insides of the small purse.

&quot;Hmm... what&#39;s this?&quot;

Heart&#39;s head snapped up to see what Seraph had pulled from the bag, then 
with a bounce and a glad cry she snatched it up.

&quot;My sword!&quot; Heart&#39;s face erupted in unabashed joy as she held up the 
elegant weapon.

From tip to pommel, it was just over five feet long. The blade was an 
elongated leaf shape, broad at the head, then tapering to a narrow 
middle and flaring out again right above its base. Circular blades 
formed blade breakers on either side of the flare, their outer edges 
sharpened. Faint traceries of blue light danced along the mirror-bright 
cutting edges. The flats were dead black in contrast to the polished 
edges, almost seeming to draw the light in. The blade was set into a 
rounded cone-shaped hilt piece, from which sprang a finely-crafted 
crosspiece carved into the shape of silver angel wings. A large sapphire 
graced either side of the golden hilt guard, of a blue so deep it seemed 
the gems had no bottom. A spiral of twisted copper descended from the 
cross guard to a second ring of gold supporting a golden circle like a 
halo. The hilt that sprang from the ring was an elegant hardwood carved 
into a graceful repeat of the blade&#39;s curves. A heavy gold pommel 
crowned the hilt, its edges carved into a design of an Egyptian papyrus 
flower. From the center of the pommel a spire rose to a carved crystal 
heart that glowed crimson from an inner light that shone as brightly as 
Heart&#39;s joy.

&quot;I still have my sword!&quot; Heart whispered, her eyes behind her rose 
glasses shining.

&quot;See, Beloved?&quot; Seraph said brightly. &quot;They can kick an angel out of 
Heaven, but they can&#39;t steal your birthright.&quot; She rose to give Heart a 
hug.

As she did so, Heart&#39;s purse fell over and one last object fell out. The 
bundle of papers fell to the floor, trailing the ends of the white 
ribbon that bound them. Seraph bent to pick them up.

&quot;My eviction papers,&quot; Heart said sourly before Seraph had a chance to 
ask.

&quot;What should I do with them?&quot;

&quot;Just&#151;&quot; Heart sighed. &quot;Just throw them away. It&#39;s not like I need them 
anymore.&quot; With finality and resignation, she replaced the sword in the 
purse and began putting everything away...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lipton sighed and threw the folder on his desk. It was as useless as the 
rest. The only real evidence had been dismissed as a hoax... Again.

He looked at the plaster casts the evidence team had made, the ones no 
one had taken seriously. Personally, Lipton felt like cheering... maybe. 
It was hard to make up his mind on how he should react to real tangible 
proof he wasn&#39;t insane.

The two larger casts were very plainly the bottom of a pair of 
spike-heeled platforms, woman&#146;s size 10. Somehow, they had been driven 
through six inches of asphalt to imprint the clay beneath. Overlaying 
the soles of the shoes, and descending slightly deeper into the clay, 
was a pair of cloven hooves, somewhat smaller than a cow&#39;s and somewhat 
larger than a goat&#39;s. Lipton figured that after she had changed, her 
leap up had driven her hooves into the clay. It fit with the witness&#39;s 
testimony.

The other cast was almost more disturbing. It had had to be cut 
carefully from the asphalt, but had emerged nearly perfect. It was a 
feminine hand, the fingers slim and graceful, the nails a good five 
inches long. The evidence team had almost chucked it, sure someone had 
planted a joke, though no one could figure out how. Lipton had caught 
them before they had disposed of it and rescued it along with the 
others. He stared at it, unsure even he wanted to believe it. The 
strength it hinted at was... unsettling. He had debated about tossing 
all three himself, but had decided they at least made interesting 
paperweights.

He leaned back in his chair and rubbed his temples. This case made 
absolutely no sense! Mrs. L. had been absolutely positive that the tall, 
white-haired female had been a demon, but there were only a handful of 
female demon types he was aware of, and what she looked like made no 
sense. There was only one female demon type he was positive could have 
caused the carnage in the alley and made the hand imprint, but there was 
no way the witness could have mistaken six arms and a snake&#39;s lower body 
for batwings...

Lipton shuddered at the memory of his one and only encounter with a 
Marilith. The super-fast, six-armed Cusinart had nearly turned him into 
stew beef before he could blow her heart out with blessed 12-gauge 
slugs. He&#39;d been lucky, but he knew there was no way to mistake a 
Marilith for anything else.

Trouble was, the wings and hooves were common to about three of the 
other types, but none of them could be classed as fighters. So where did 
that leave him? He couldn&#39;t even confirm that the girl had been a demon 
beyond the witness&#39;s testimony. He&#39;d seen the angel well enough, but the 
demoness had been fully shape-changed into human. All he had to go on as 
to her identity was a license plate that made no sense. SE2 YOU.

Why had the demon saved the angel? Mrs. L. had been positive they had 
been in love, but she was a lonely woman OD&#39;d on daytime soaps and baby 
boom memories. Not exactly what Lipton would call reliable.

And the angel? Why hadn&#39;t she fought? Or just flown away? The only 
weapons Mrs. L. had described were the demon&#39;s, yet every angel Lipton 
had ever seen possessed a sword; why hadn&#39;t this one?

His head was pounding as he decided his only option was to check the 
plate. Most of the tags he&#39;d ever tried to run on demons before had been 
stolen or nonexistent... maybe for once he&#39;d be lucky enough to have one 
who was actually registered... Time for a trip to the Pit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lilith studied Lipton from her vantage point in a spider&#39;s web above the 
door to his office, wondering what was going on in the demon hunter&#39;s 
head. She&#39;d been amused to find out he&#39;d been assigned to the case. The 
New York rumor mill had been buzzing for years about how annoyingly 
effective Detective Bruce Lipton had been at demon slaying, but Lilith 
had never had a reason to look him up before. She&#39;d found the 
detective&#39;s reaction to the plaster casts curious... Most mortals found 
evidence for the existence of supernatural beings like herself either 
reassuring, or incredibly unsettling. Lipton seemed almost... resigned?

Most curious.

He&#39;d finally come to some decision and got up to leave. She hurriedly 
dropped down as he passed and latched onto his tan trench coat, changing 
into a tan moth to better camouflage. This... diversion... was becoming 
intriguing...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lipton headed down to the sub-basement, home to the super computers that 
linked the NYPD precincts and lair of the two super geeks who ran those 
computers: Randy Barnes and Barry Davis, the only two people in the 
precinct he could be said to be more than working with...

No. Randy and Barry were probably the only people in the precinct he 
could legitimately call friends, however loosely. The rest of the 
precinct had labeled them &quot;The Three Muskaweirds&quot; since Barnes was 
obsessed with aliens, and Davis was convinced everything was a 
government conspiracy, from early morning traffic to planes vanishing in 
the Triangle. Lipton knew better, but saw no point in trying to convince 
them. They used everything as evidence in their favor anyway. At least 
they never raised an eyebrow when he had them covertly close a case for 
him. He had solved them after all, even if his superiors wouldn&#39;t have 
approved of his methods, or believed his reasons for using them.

But knowing they&#39;d been solved helped him sleep better at night.

Besides, they all shared a common bond, one shared by all those whose 
beliefs included a bright future, the nobility of the human spirit, and 
the need to expand their horizons. A belief that merit was rewarded, 
that going against the grain when you were right was justified, and 
above all, a drive to &quot;know all that is knowable, learn all that is 
learnable.&quot; That drive had created a generation of people whose 
imaginations and vast knowledge let them see the world with a unique 
perspective, and given them a need to dream and create, at least in 
their own estimation.

In other words, they all watched Star Trek.

So when Davis rose at Lipton&#39;s entry, snapped him a salute and said, 
&quot;Captain on the bridge!&quot; followed by Barnes, Lipton&#39;s only response was 
a sour &quot;He was Admiral Kirk for awhile, you know.&quot;

The other two looked at each other and rolled their eyes.

&quot;Still worshipping the wannabe, I see,&quot; Barnes quipped.

&quot;First gen is so limited for creatures,&quot; Davis chimed in. &quot;Not like 
DS9.&quot;

&quot;How lame can you get? Sisko is no comparison for Picard!&quot; Barnes 
parried.

They could go on like this for hours if Lipton let them, but he was here 
at least semi-officially. &quot;One word gentlemen...&quot; he interrupted. They 
turned expectantly. &quot;Janeway.&quot;

Both the tech wizards emitted little tiger growls.

&quot;Oh, Janeway...&quot; Davis said, stretching his tall lanky frame in his 
chair. &quot;Many nights I have dreamed of... Janeway.&quot;

&quot;That with your left hand or your right?&quot; Barnes smirked.

Davis flicked his pudgy partner off, then addressed the detective. &quot;You 
coming to the con this weekend?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Fraid not. I&#39;ve got a multiple I&#39;m working.&quot;

&quot;Ooh? Another weird one?&quot; Barnes cooed.

Lipton nodded.

&quot;Hot damn. Whatcha got for us?&quot;

Lipton handed over the tag number. &quot;Black Corvette. New York tags.&quot;

&quot;Seduce you? How cute.&quot; Barnes said wryly as Davis turned to his 
computer and logged on to the DMV.

&quot;Seduce?&quot; Lipton started. Ahh... of course. S E 2... deuce... you. 
&quot;Cute.&quot; He echoed. Trouble was, it gave him a clue as to what the 
demoness was, but that made no sense. Succubae weren&#39;t warriors... they 
were sex demons. He&#39;d never run into a single one that could fight worth 
a damn.

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Davis announced. &quot;Seraph Darkfell, nice name. No alias 
listed.&quot;

Seraph Darkfell? Another cute pun for fallen angel. Lipton thought with 
a sigh. Whoever she is, she has a sense of humor.

Davis handed him the printout of her license while he looked at her 
record. &quot;Hmm... couple of hundred minor traffic tickets... but not a 
single bench warrant. Let me check her credit records...&quot; He started 
typing again as Lipton checked the license.

The face it revealed was stunning, fairly typical for a succubus. The 
outfit she must have been wearing had to have been extremely low cut, as 
the photo appeared to be a nude, again typical. Only... there was 
something different about her he just couldn&#39;t place. She just didn&#39;t 
look like a typical succubus...

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Davis said as Seraph&#39;s credit records showed up on his 
screen. He whistled. &quot;Whoa. I wish I had her credit limit. Quarter mill, 
quarter mill, hundred thou, half mill. Shit! Her investment portfolio 
alone is worth &#151; uh, make that was worth, thirty mill. Looks like it was 
seized and all of her credit&#39;s been cancelled. I&#39;d say IRS, probably at 
the behest of the CIA. Houses, stocks, property. All gone. Looks like 
the car&#39;s hers though. Paid in full, cash. &#39;72 Corvette Stingray, custom 
order from Detroit. Police Interceptor engine kit, minus tweaks. 
Probably had &#39;em added. Damn thing&#39;s a rocket. Original owner... Seraph 
Darkfell? I&#39;ll be damned... she&#39;s aged well for someone over forty.&quot;

Lipton nodded. &quot;So most of her assets are gone?&quot;

&quot;Looks like,&quot; Barnes said from his console. &quot;This record&#39;s a maze. Looks 
like she might still have a few assets but it&#39;s gonna take a while to 
track them down through all the dead ends. Whoever set this up is a 
pro.&quot;

&quot;Probably CIA. Most likely she&#39;s a government agent. This sudden turn in 
fortune probably means she&#39;s gone renegade and is on the run,&quot; Davis 
said. He looked at the license again. &quot;No way that is over forty.&quot; He 
tapped a few more keys, changing screens faster than Lipton could keep 
track of. &quot;Yeah, see.&quot; He pointed his nose at the screen while still 
tapping. &quot;Police records. She&#39;s been arrested a shitload of times. Looks 
like either no charges filed or charges dropped. Suspected prostitution, 
suspected drug use, suspected drug smuggling, lewd and lascivious 
behavior... What the fuck?! Suspected bootlegger?&quot; He called up the 
file. &quot;1928? &quot; Disbelief colored his voice.

&quot;Must have been her grandmother.&quot; Lipton supplied.

&quot;Had to have been, or she&#39;s using a cover identity that&#39;s been around 
awhile.&quot; Davis nodded.

&quot;Any of the charges stick?&quot;

Davis scanned further. &quot;Nope. No pictures, prints, or DNA on file 
either. They probably made sure of that.&quot; No need to ask who they were.

&quot;Same on Interpol.&quot; Barnes added. &quot;Lots of arrests, no convictions and 
looks like she never even saw the inside of a courtroom. But she&#39;s been 
all over the world.&quot; He gave Lipton a look that said he wasn&#39;t buying 
the grandmother line. &quot;Most of the places she&#39;s been have been hotspots, 
just before or just after trouble.&quot; His eyes showed he&#39;d come up with 
his own explanation for Seraph&#39;s long record.

&quot;Want me to put an APB on her?&quot; Davis asked. &quot;I can, but it&#39;ll put up a 
red flag to the Agency and the IRS that you&#39;re looking for her.&quot;

Lipton shook his head. &quot;Just dig me up everything you can find on her, 
no matter how far away or long ago. This case is so strange you never 
know what might be useful.&quot;

Both of the geeks&#39; eyes gleamed. Whether long-lived alien transplant, or 
government conspiracy agent, it didn&#39;t really matter as much as the joy 
of the hunt. Lipton nodded to himself as he headed back upstairs. They 
had never believed in his &quot;demons&quot; but they were useful nonetheless. If 
it existed online, they&#39;d find it.

Unfortunately, the trip had led to more questions, not less...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Back in his office, Lipton put his feet up on his desk and watched a tan 
moth struggling in a spider web above his door for a few seconds before 
reaching into the right hand drawer and pulling out his recorder. He 
closed his eyes as he activated it and spoke.

&quot;Puzzles, puzzles, puzzles. I have six dead demons in an alley, not that 
anyone else believes that, one live one who&#39;s proving to be one of the 
most confusing demons I&#39;ve ever run into, and one angel who apparently 
needed saving, and if the witness is telling the truth, by the demoness 
no less.&quot;

&quot;Fact: Something killed six combat demons in a matter of minutes.

&quot;Fact: I saw the angel myself.&quot;

Lilith nearly fell out of the web. He had?

&quot;Fact: I saw the supposed demoness with the angel. However I cannot 
confirm her status as a demon yet, she looked human, even though she is 
extremely tall for a female. However, evidence does suggest she is a 
demon, and most likely a succubus.&quot;

Lilith was impressed. He was more knowledgeable than she&#39;d given him 
credit for.

&quot;Fact: Most succubae are not warriors. They are built for sex, not 
combat.&quot;

&quot;Fact: Angels and demons do not get along. Encounters between them are 
usually fatal for the demon involved.&quot;

Lilith smiled mentally. That wasn&#39;t really true. The G.O.D. just did its 
best to clean up the messes before humans found them, the better to 
promote it&#39;s &quot;infallible&quot; image.

&quot;These are established facts, or have been previously. So now we are 
left with questions this case has raised.

&quot;Question one: Who is Seraph Darkfell? Why did she save the angel, and, 
if she is a succubus, where did she learn to fight?&quot;

&quot;Question two: Who is the angel? Why was she there? Why did she become 
the target of a party of six demons? And most importantly, why didn&#39;t, 
or why couldn&#39;t she defend herself?&quot;

&quot;Question three: What is the connection between the angel and Seraph 
Darkfell? The witness seemed to think they were in love, but that makes 
no sense for several reasons. First, they are angel and demon. By all 
previous evidence, they should be trying to kill one another. Second, 
they are by appearance, both female, and the last I checked, 
homosexuality was still classed as a sin. Thirdly, by that reasoning the 
angel could not still be an angel if she had committed a sin. Obviously, 
there must be another reason, or there are factors involved I&#39;ve never 
heard of.&quot;

Lilith was giving the detective a slow once-over. He was definitely 
interesting. She wondered how he would react if she seduced him. He was 
certainly not like most mortals she&#39;d dealt with before.

Oblivious to the spider&#39;s scrutiny, Lipton reached out, picked up the 
plaster hand and looked at it as he continued.

&quot;And finally, Question four: Who is behind Miss Darkfell? Until 
yesterday, no succubus I&#39;ve run into has ever had the kind of clout 
Seraph had. Credit cards, land investments, stock portfolio, I&#39;ve never 
run into any demon with that kind of background. I&#39;ve dealt with a few 
succubae in High Society, but every one has been a kept woman. None of 
them had the kind of bankroll Seraph had. Obviously, someone went 
through a lot of trouble to set her up, and just as obviously, pulled it 
down. Beyond that, who has kept her out of trouble? Most succubae have 
records, it&#39;s a natural result of their work, but someone went to a 
great deal of trouble to keep Seraph&#39;s record clean. Who? The answer 
could go a long way to explaining some of the mysteries around this 
case. Like motive. What could force a succubus to fight?&quot;

Lilith smiled to herself. She&#39;d had no idea Mephie had invested so much 
into Seraph. No wonder he was so upset with her defection.

Lipton was continuing. &quot;Something... or someone?&quot; A thought seemed to 
occur to the detective. &quot;Could Seraph be being controlled?&quot; he mused.

He reached into the desk again and brought out a thick manila folder 
labeled &quot;Magick Users&quot; and flipped it open. Inside was a thick stack of 
8x10s. Lipton looked through the stack slowly, reading the notes he had 
written on the backs of each photo. He stopped at one of a 
refined-looking Latino which had been crossed out with a red marker.

&quot;Santobal. I&#39;d suspect you, knowing your penchant for &#39;enslaving&#39; 
succubae and for murdering angels, but somehow, I just don&#39;t see you 
surviving that 12-gauge slug I put through your brain.&quot; He chuckled as 
he scanned through the rest. As he dropped the last one, he sighed and 
rubbed his eyes. &quot;Not one of you has the power to make a succubus 
capable of winning a fight against six combat demons.&quot; He tossed the 
folder back into the drawer. &quot;Which means I&#39;m either up against a new 
mage, or someone else gave her the power.&quot;

Lilith chuckled to herself. If he only knew how close he actually is!

Lipton looked up at the clawed hand he held, then shook his head. &quot;Maybe 
it has to do with the angel?&quot; he asked to no one in particular. He 
clicked off the recorder and rose. As Lilith watched, he bolted the door 
to his office and moved to a locked cabinet against the far wall. He 
took out a set of keys and opened the cabinet. Lilith gasped in surprise 
at what was inside. A lot of would-be mages would kill for the contents 
of the cabinet, and if the church had ever seen it, Lipton would have 
been excommunicated and burned at the stake on the spot. The majority of 
the books were trash, New Age mysticism, but a few of them were real. 
Ancient books dealing with Demonology and Black Magick, many written in 
Latin... A Hebrew Kabala sat next to Assyrian religious texts and even a 
copy the Mahabharata in Sanskrit was on the shelf. It was certainly the 
last thing Lilith had expected. She wondered where he had gotten them.

He knelt down to the bottom of the case, removed an iron box, and took 
it to his desk. Curious, Lilith crawled across the ceiling to get a 
better look. After Lipton sat down, he took out another key and undid a 
lock on the iron box, then opened it. As the lid swung open, Lilith was 
nearly shocked into dropping her shape change from the holy energies the 
book poured forth. The reason for the iron box became easily apparent: 
unshielded, the book in the box would have turned the other texts into 
smoking ruin.

In appearance it was nothing special. It had a plain thick leather cover 
reinforced with thin iron straps, and a simple clasp that held it 
closed. The pages were crisp vellum, yellowed with age but otherwise 
whole and undamaged. The title was simple, written in elegant gold 
script, but Lilith nearly passed out in shock as she read it. At most, 
the book looked a hundred years old, but she knew it was over four 
thousand, and that the passing of time would not have affected its 
accuracy, Jehovah had seen to that. Only fifteen copies were known to 
even exist, and Lilith hadn&#39;t know of one in New York, yet somehow, the 
detective had managed to get a hold of a copy of the only book her first 
ex-husband had ever written.

The Directory of Angels.

Lilith nearly panicked. If the Detective could even read the Directory, 
it meant he had True Sight! He could see her! Only the fact she was 
shape-changed instead of glamoured had kept him from discovering her 
already...

Then logic reasserted itself. He hadn&#39;t discovered her, and so long as 
she didn&#39;t shift where he could see her, she was safe. It simply made 
for an interesting tidbit. The detective really could see demons and 
angels... even glamoured ones... only a shape shift couldn&#39;t be seen 
through.

It made the notion of seducing him more appealing. Seeing how he dealt 
with the Queen of Hell could be... entertaining.

But that was for a later time, for now, she watched as he slowly flipped 
through the book, looking at the picture of each angel and reading the 
short description. After nearly an hour, at the end of the G&#39;s, he lost 
patience. &quot;This is hopeless. Without a name, I&#39;ll never find her.&quot; He 
got up and paced the office for a minute than grabbed his long empty mug 
of coffee. &quot;Definitely need a caffeine break. Then maybe I&#39;ll check out 
her apartment.&quot; He unlocked the door, and at the verge of heading for 
the coffee maker, paused and looked at the book on his desk.

&quot;Hell, it&#39;s just for a moment...&quot; He exited, but locked the dead bolt 
behind him anyway.

Lilith shimmered into her own form beside the desk. It was time to check 
on Bhaalor. She looked down at the Directory one last time.

The breeze from Lipton&#39;s departure had flipped several pages over, and 
there, staring serenely up from the page, was Heart&#39;s face...

Lilith laughed all the way to Hell.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In many ways, the Pearly Gates Complex was the nexus of Heaven. Through 
its myriad of gates and terminals passed all the souls of mortals who 
believed in the Christian Savior, and all of Heaven&#39;s various agents. On 
a good day, over a million souls passed through is massive halls, 
refurbished time and again as the Human Race expanded its population.

Looking down on it from his plush fifth floor office, Saint Peter could 
recall when he had sat at a table outside the gates with his pen and the 
Book of Life. That had been replaced over the centuries with a library 
and an army of scribes, and most recently, by the vast Database of Life 
and the sprawling bureaucracy of the Department of Immigrations, of 
which he was President.

A long way from the simple life of a fisherman.

He sighed and turned from the huge bay window. It had been so much 
simpler then, all he&#39;d had to fear was crucifixion. Now? Between the 
massive juggernaut of the Department and... his other duties... he&#39;d 
welcome another crucifixion as a nice relaxing break from all of his 
worries.

Horrible thought for a Saint, he mused as he sat down behind a massive 
desk piled high with stacks of paper and documents, all of which needed 
his personal attention. He was contemplating setting fire to all of them 
when a document caught his eye.

He pulled the papers out of the stack that had partially concealed them, 
and confirmed that his eyes hadn&#39;t deceived him. They were exile papers.

What in home&#39;s name is this? I&#39;m supposed to be apprised of any exiles. 
He looked at the bottom of the page where his signature had to go for 
any exile to be processed.

His flowing signature sprawled across the signature line. Hmm... 
funny... I don&#39;t remember signing this.

He flipped through the rest of the form, noting that it had been 
processed and the Exile Clerk&#39;s paperwork had been completed yesterday 
morning. Everything appeared to be in order...

But he definitely didn&#39;t remember approving an angel&#39;s exile.

He shoved the other papers off his desk, ignoring them as they fluttered 
to neat stacks on the floor, until he found his video intercom.

The G.O.D. had frowned at his modernizing the D.O.I., but he&#39;d 
succeeding in convincing them of the need, and it made his life much 
easier... So few of Heaven&#39;s agents really understood modern technology, 
which made his clandestine activities easier to conceal. But this time, 
it looked like someone had expected that same effect to shield them from 
his scrutiny...

The man who answered the vidcom was a distinguished older gentleman, a 
few years younger than Peter in appearance. In life, he&#39;d been one of 
the few people Peter had come close to hating, despite his master&#39;s 
teachings. Alive, the man had been almost single-handedly responsible 
for corrupting, as far as Peter had seen it, the Christian religion from 
the elegant and beautiful teachings of his master, to the bloated 
law-ridden tool of the G.O.D. it had become. Saint Paul had been born a 
Pharisee, and even after his &quot;conversion&quot; had remained one. His &quot;advice&quot; 
helped turned his new faith into as rule-bound a religion as his old 
one, and he had never realized he was playing right into the enemy&#39;s 
hands doing so. Peter had fought him while still alive, but had lacked 
the charisma Paul exuded, and Paul had never understood why Peter had 
been so angry about the spreading of the faith... But then, Paul had 
never actually met Christ while he was alive. Peter had been quick to 
change that when he had died.

In two thousand years, they hadn&#39;t had much success, and for the most 
part, the G.O.D. ignored them. Peter had remained the gatekeeper because 
that was the role he&#39;d been given by tradition, and Paul had pretty much 
become his vice president, but neither role had any real power or say in 
the G.O.D.&#39;s policies.

But occasionally, the G.O.D. made mistakes... and this had all the 
earmarks of one.

Peter held up the form to show Paul. &quot;I think you might want to come up 
here... Looks like I have a case for you...&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The girls had showered, with a short break from actual washing for other 
activity, then Seraph had had a paper delivered with breakfast. She 
pored over it with Heart as they ate, making a list of places to check 
out for jobs. Then Seraph availed herself of the modem line while Heart 
called and made appointments. The girls finally left the room around 
eleven and hopped in the &#39;vette to make the interviews.

Hours passed and Heart was dizzied by interviews, applications, and 
social security numbers. Seraph had tried to explain the concept of the 
social security to her when she had run across a request for the number 
on her first application, but the explanation made no sense to Heart, so 
Seraph had simply given her a number to write into the space, one that 
had belonged to one of her alter egos until that morning.

Seraph had given the basic info to a hacker she had &quot;helped&quot; not long 
before her retirement, and now the number reflected the personal data 
and history of one Harteriel Serafina. It had been a favor returned for 
getting him a pair of live-in girlfriends, twin sisters who incidentally 
had been living on the street before Seraph had introduced them all. 
Now, all three lived in a nice apartment, the girls no longer had to 
hook, and the hacker was basically teaching them about computers. Heaven 
frowned on the arrangement, but they all three were very happy and the 
hacker&#39;s desire to take care of his girlfriends had even encouraged him 
to take a legitimate job with a computer security company. Hacking the 
Social Security card had been the first non-legal job he&#39;d pulled in the 
two years since.

Another example, in Seraph&#39;s opinion, of Heaven&#39;s messed-up morality. 
They were happy, law-abiding, productive people now, but condemned to 
hell for the &quot;sin&quot; of fornication, because they all couldn&#39;t marry each 
other.

After several hours of job hunting, they stopped for lunch, the two 
sitting dispiritedly in a small cafe downtown.

&quot;We&#39;re never going to find human jobs at this rate,&quot; Heart sighed.

&quot;No, love, I know we can do it. How many of your interviews said that 
they would call you back?&quot;

&quot;None,&quot; Heart&#39;s beautiful face held an unhappy frown. &quot;They all said I 
didn&#39;t have enough experience.&quot;

Seraph reached into her cleavage and pulled out the list. She looked it 
over, her brow wrinkled in thought. Finally, she looked at Heart, an 
idea bright in her mind.

&quot;Beloved. I think we&#39;re going about this all wrong.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean? I&#39;m doing exactly what you told me to, Beloved.&quot; She 
looked down at her exposed cleavage. &quot;Even though having my shirt pulled 
this low is a little uncomfortable.&quot;

Seraph blushed as she moved a little in her chair. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, love. I 
thought it would help. You can pull it up if you like.&quot;

Heart gave her a sidelong look over her glasses. &quot;No. I&#39;ve noticed you 
seem to enjoy looking at me more since I pulled it down.&quot;

Seraph blushed even brighter as she wrenched her eyes away from the rise 
and fall of Heart&#39;s breasts. &quot;Ummm...&quot;

Heart laughed. &quot;I love you... Anyway, what am I doing wrong?&quot;

Seraph fought the urge to let her eyes return to their previous gaze as 
she answered. &quot;Well, umm... maybe we should be trying to find jobs where 
we do have experience. You were the best matchmaker in Heaven. We should 
get you a job doing that here.&quot;

&quot;Are there jobs like that on Earth?&quot;

&quot;Of course. Humans thrive on personal contact!&quot; Seraph exclaimed. &quot;I&#39;ve 
met lots of my assignments through matchmaking services. Lots of lonely 
people try to meet through matchmakers. Most of them are just looking 
for companionship, the sex was just incidental. I&#39;ve started lots of 
affairs that way, and I&#39;ve seen a lot of relationships that came under 
your old office&#39;s jurisdiction come from them too.&quot;

Heart nodded. &quot;Lonely souls needing someone to love.&quot;

&quot;Well, humans have all kinds of ways for meeting one another,&quot; Seraph 
said. &quot;And I know they have matchmaking services that try to do just 
what you used to do, bring two people together who will fall in love, 
just like there are places that do the kind of matchmaking I used to do 
too...&quot;

Seraph stopped as a thought struck her, then she groaned. &quot;I am such an 
idiot. Why am I worried where I&#39;m going to get a job, when I already 
have a job just waiting for me to come back and take it.&quot;

&quot;You are not an idiot,&quot; Heart said firmly.

&quot;Yes, I am. I&#39;ve been worried about how quickly we&#39;ve been draining my 
bank account, and forgetting where the money in it comes from. I already 
have a job. All I have to do is go and tell the manager to put me on the 
lineup.&quot;

&quot;Oh? What will you be doing?&quot; Heart looked excited. Seraph hoped she 
still would be after she told her what the job was.

&quot;Dancing,&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Heart&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;Maybe I can too? I know the minuet, the 
waltz, the&#151;&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that kind of dancing, dear,&quot; Seraph interrupted. &quot;I&#39;ll be 
doing erotic dances.&quot;

Heart looked confused. &quot;What does that entail?&quot;

Seraph looked off to the side. &quot;Well, for one thing, a lot less 
clothing.&quot;

Heart nodded. &quot;How much less?&quot;

&quot;Umm...&quot; Seraph looked down. &quot;I think New York law says I have to keep 
my g-string on nowadays.&quot;

&quot;You mean you&#39;d be nude?&quot; Heart looked puzzled. &quot;Don&#39;t humans forbid 
that?&quot;

&quot;Only in public,&quot;

&quot;But if you&#39;re dancing for people, won&#39;t you be in public?&quot;

&quot;No. It&#39;s a club where men come to watch nude women dance.&quot;

&quot;Oh... Why?&quot; Heart really did look confused.

Seraph shook her head. &quot;Oh, Beloved, you really are an innocent to the 
ways of lust. It&#39;s so the men can fantasize about having sex with me,&quot; 
she admitted.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Heart&#39;s face fell. &quot;I see. Well, if you need to do that to feed I 
suppose it&#39;s okay.&quot; Her voice held a note of sadness.

Seraph took Heart&#39;s hand. &quot;Beloved. I don&#39;t need them to feed. I need 
you for that, and only you. You are the one I love, and only you can 
satisfy my desires. But men will pay a lot of money just to fantasize 
about sex with me, and I never have to actually fulfill that fantasy. I 
can dance and arouse their lust without having to do anything else... 
except of course to arouse my desire for you even more.&quot;

Heart smiled at Seraph&#39;s words, but then a thought struck. &quot;But isn&#39;t 
that demeaning, Beloved?&quot; she asked plaintively.

&quot;No, Beloved. Not for me. I&#39;m a succubus. I was created to arouse lust. 
It was my purpose for existing before you taught me how to love. It&#39;s 
all I&#39;ve done for over a thousand years.&quot; Seraph struggled desperately 
for the right words to say. &quot;I took pride in my work, Beloved. That&#39;s 
part of what you fell in love with, no?&quot; Heart nodded. &quot;I love to dance, 
Beloved, and it&#39;s always been one of my most effective means for 
arousing lust. What&#39;s best about it, is that I can make us money doing 
something I enjoy.&quot; Inspiration hit. &quot;Besides, Beloved, we were both the 
best at what we did because we loved our jobs. It doesn&#39;t matter that 
we&#39;re not working for them anymore. We don&#39;t have to give up on what we 
love doing, what we are best at! Heaven doesn&#39;t have a monopoly on 
Love!&quot;

            Heart still looked uncertain, so Seraph continued. &quot;Heart, 
we can keep doing what we&#39;re doing right now and spend our immortal 
lives unhappy, or we can continue doing what we were meant to do, make 
people happy. We can do that better than Heaven or Hell, because we can 
give them a love like ours. The love, the passion, the joy, all of it! 
All we have to do is keep doing what we love best, our jobs, but for the 
people we help, not for our idiot ex-bosses!&quot;

Heart&#39;s eyes said she wanted to believe. &quot;Oh, Beloved... I don&#39;t know if 
I can bear to keep doing my job anymore.&quot; Tears trickled down from the 
corners of her eyes.

&quot;No Beloved, that&#39;s not true! You can do it better!&quot; Seraph tried to 
keep her voice encouraging, but she too fought back tears. The sight of 
how badly Theliel had undermined Heart&#39;s confidence infuriated her, and 
it was all she could do not to howl her frustration. If I ever get my 
hands on him again... She left the thought unfinished as primal 
bloodlust coursed through her body.

&quot;Beloved? Are you okay?&quot; Heart&#39;s voice was full of concern.

Seraph shook her head as s few tears escaped across her cheeks. &quot;When I 
think about what Theliel must have said to you to hurt you so much, the 
horrible thoughts he put into your head...&quot; Her teeth and hands 
clenched. &quot;I just want to rip out his heart and eat it raw!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Beloved...&quot;

Seraph looked up, pleading in her eyes behind the anger. &quot;You are an 
angel of Love, Heart. Nothing Theliel can say will ever change that 
unless you give in to him and give up. If you do that, he&#39;ll win. I know 
you can do it, love.&quot; Her head hung till her bangs overshadowed her 
eyes. &quot;Won&#39;t you please try?&quot;

&quot;B-but...&quot;

&quot;But nothing, Heart. Theliel didn&#39;t make you good at your job. You did.&quot;

&quot;Did I, Beloved?&quot; Heart looked at her. &quot;I always thought so, but...&quot;

&quot;Beloved... He isn&#39;t the Creator. Only an angel. Like you.&quot; Seraph met 
her eyes through the rose-tinted lenses. &quot;He couldn&#39;t take your love, 
your halo, or your sword, so he tried to take your spirit instead. Don&#39;t 
let him win...&quot;

Heart saw the faith Seraph had in her, and it helped to spark her own. 
&quot;I will try, Beloved.&quot; She smiled. &quot;That&#39;s all I can promise.&quot;

Seraph returned her smile. &quot;That&#39;s all I could ever ask...&quot;

They gazed at each other for long moments, the cafe ceasing to exist 
around them. Activity continued around them, but they took no notice, 
lost in a world where no words were needed... were the contentment in 
their eyes said all that needed to be said...

Then Heart rose.

&quot;Let&#39;s go get you a job, Beloved,&quot; she said to the succubus.

&quot;Love? Are you sure?&quot; Seraph rose as well, pulling a wad of cash from 
her cleavage and tossing several bills down on the table.

&quot;Of course, Beloved,&quot; Heart grinned. &quot;You&#39;re right. We should do what 
we&#39;re good at, and I can definitely attest to how good you are at 
arousing lust. If people will pay you to dance for them and arouse their 
lust... well... that&#39;s our good fortune, although I still don&#39;t see how 
dancing could get them that aroused.&quot;

Seraph smiled. &quot;Let me get you alone tonight, and I&#39;ll demonstrate.&quot;

Heart smiled indulgently. &quot;Does that mean I might get a full 
demonstration?&quot;

Seraph arched an eyebrow. &quot;You mean using my powers on you?&quot;

Heart wrapped an arm around her, and gave her smile full of promises. 
&quot;Yes. I love you, Seraph... and you won my heart without them... but I 
am curious...&quot;

Seraph gave her a lopsided grin. &quot;I-I just didn&#39;t want you to think I 
was taking advantage of you...&quot;

Heart stopped at the curb and turned to her smiling mischievously.

&quot;Oh no, dear. I plan to take advantage of you...&quot;

Behind them, the busboy cleaning their table peered in puzzlement at the 
eight crescent-shaped holes that pierced the table, perfectly matching 
Seraph&#39;s nails...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The buildings were tall enough to block out the sun even though it was 
still early afternoon. A stray cat scampered across the alley, not 
sparing a glance at the girl who was wading through an ankle deep swamp 
of old newspaper. She scanned the piece of paper in her hand and looked 
around, trying to match the number to a building. She stepped further 
into the shadows, her ankle length trench coat flipping idly as she 
walked, apparently so absorbed in her quest that she didn&#39;t notice the 
mugger creeping up on her until he cocked his nine.

&quot;Reach for the sky, bitch!&quot;

Casually, she took a last drag on her cigarette and nonchalantly turned 
around as she reached up. She said not a word.

The thug appraised her for a second, noting the habit-like headdress 
that covered most of her long black hair, and the skimpy little silver 
bikini she had on under the trench, but what really caught his eye was 
the arsenal her spread coat displayed. The shotguns across her back and 
the twin cannons at her hips were definitely grown-up toys that would 
fetch him a small fortune from the fence he knew who handled that kind 
of artillery. Then again, he knew a guy who&#39;d ask no questions about the 
girl either, and she&#39;d bring a nice price too.

Fuck it. Be too much trouble to drag her there. Waste the bitch and take 
the guns and money. Not like she can use &#39;em anyways. Stick with plan 
A...

&quot;Prepare to say hello to God, baby!&quot; He began to pull the trigger, then 
something hot burned into his eye. He had just enough time to realize 
she&#39;d thrown her cigarette and fling his arm across his face before he 
felt something strike him in the arm with the force of a baseball bat.

His gun flew across the alley as she planted one of her custom-made 
blade-heeled boots in his chest and she kicked him nearly thirty feet. 
He slammed into a dumpster, denting the side before dropping to the hard 
asphalt bruised, but miraculously unbroken. He gasped for breath.

She strode up to him, a sneer on her face, the wickedly curved blades on 
her heels chiming with every step.

&quot;I have,&quot; she said flippantly. &quot;He&#39;s about two thousand years behind on 
his child support.&quot;

She placed one of those viciously bladed boots on his belly, the needle 
sharp tip just resting on his crotch. She pulled one of the small 
cannons from her hip and pointed it at his nose. He stared down the 
black maw of the barrel.

&quot;Now,&quot; she said. &quot;Give me one reason not to kill you. A good one. 
Because until now, Matthew Weaver, you&#39;ve been a scumbag. No real 
surprise that you&#39;d off a thirteen-year-old girl, or were you planning 
to sell me to that child pornographer friend of yours?&quot; Her harsh laugh 
echoed across the alley. &quot;If I thought for a second it would get this 
titanium bikini off me, I&#39;d have let you!&quot;

Her eyes full of fury, she leaned closer. &quot;So tell me, Matthew Weaver. 
How do you plead?&quot;

The thug seemed mesmerized by the barrel of the gun, his mind barely 
registering the fact she&#39;d used his name twice. In desperation, he 
closed his eyes and began a prayer he hadn&#39;t used since childhood.

&quot;Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is&#151;&quot;

Her backhanded slap rocked his head on his shoulders. &quot;Blessed this, 
blessed that... blah, blah, blah. If I had a nickel for every time I&#39;ve 
heard that.&quot; She stuck the gun against his forehead. &quot;You&#39;re a 
hypocrite. First you get yourself in deep, and now you want deliverance? 
Did it ever occur to you not to do the bad thing in the first place? 
Now, I&#39;ll ask you again, Matthew Weaver. How do you plead? Are you a 
scumbag? Why shouldn&#39;t I just shoot you?&quot;

Fear even stronger than before streaked across his mind as her use of 
his name registered.

&quot;H-how do you know my name?&quot; he whispered hoarsely, an ominous feeling 
in the pit of his stomach warning him he didn&#39;t want to know.

&quot;Matthew, Matthew, Matthew...&quot; She said as she pulled the gun away from 
his forehead and leaned on the bent knee, pressing the blade against his 
crotch. A warm trickle began to flow down his leg, either blood or 
urine. &quot;You&#39;ve been praying to me since you were six, and you don&#39;t know 
who I am?&quot;

&quot;No... no way...&quot; he whispered, as if denial would chase away the terror 
he felt.

She grabbed him by the collar as she effortlessly lifted him and placed 
the gun under his chin.

&quot;Go to church, scumbag. Pray for forgiveness and confess your sins,&quot; she 
cooed. &quot;Go straight, or I will be back, and have no doubt I&#39;ll know 
where to find you...&quot;

She smiled as she holstered the pistol and let him slump back against 
the dumpster as she turned to sashay off.

&quot;Wh-who are you?&quot; he croaked.

&quot;The Virgin,&quot; she called back over her shoulder.

Weaver stared after her, the fear in him doubling at the utter 
confidence she exuded. She had no fear of him going for his gun, there 
was only the sureness that she was finished here.

&quot;Mother of God,&quot; he whispered involuntarily.

Her reply was faint, but her voice echoed in his ears mockingly.

&quot;Exactly...&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mephistopheles glanced around the apartment, feeling the faintest echo 
of remorse. It was dingy, dusty and the little bit of light that came 
through the dust-encrusted windows did little to improve its appearance, 
but if he knew his best agent, it had not always been so. Yesterday, it 
had probably appeared a hundred times as large, and been impeccably 
neat, a lavish plush den suitable for lusty debauchery. The old rusted 
bed frame had probably been an oaken four post bed, perfect for bedtime 
sport. The cracked bathtub had probably been a spa filled with crystal 
water that flowed from golden faucets...

No, not clear, he thought. Bubbles... He smiled as he imagined those 
fine white breasts, their lush pink nipples bobbing at the waterline, 
laced in bubbles... But, time for those thoughts later. He had work to 
do.

He began searching the apartment, unceremoniously dumping and 
overturning the bed, the dresser, the closet... anything he could find, 
looking for clues to where the succubus might have gone to ground. In 
the process, the Demon Lord caught an item from his belt on a doorknob 
and it fell to the chipped concrete of the floor with a clear chime like 
a bell. He reached down and retrieved the silver hoop, tarnished nearly 
black, and stroked it fondly, reminiscing...

The entrance door slammed open, startling him into dropping the metal 
ring. It rolled across the floor and clattered to a halt against the far 
wall.

He looked up at the young girl who&#39;d just entered so dramatically, 
taking in the knee-high blue leather boots, the lithe shapely body, the 
arsenal. He would have given nearly anything to have a way past that 
titanium chastity set she wore, but he never would, and he knew that 
trying would be his death. She was pure for a reason he feared as much 
as he desired, a reason not even his master Lucifer would cross lightly. 
She was the ultimate prize for the Lord of Temptation, the one woman 
pure enough to have born the Son of God... the Queen of Heaven... the 
Virgin.

&quot;Mary,&quot; he said, his voice conveying disgust, but he couldn&#39;t hide the 
fear and desire he felt for her.

&quot;Well, hello Mephie,&quot; she cooed, knowing how much he hated the nickname. 
She played with the keyless padlock that sealed her metal halter top. 
The small lock swung back and forth with a hypnotic rhythm between her 
shapely breasts. &quot;You get manlier every time I see you.&quot;

He took a step back. &quot;Don&#39;t try to vamp me, Virgin. Yours is one 
maidenhood I&#39;d rather not claim,&quot; he lied.

Mary sauntered up to him and looked into his eyes with a sultry look. 
&quot;But Mephie, you know how much I want you.&quot; Her hand casually cupped his 
crotch as she purred. &quot;And you know you want me... It&#39;s not like my 
husband cares...&quot;

The Demon Lord felt his loins starting to betray him, visions of Mary 
chained to a bed, nude, begging him to come and give her release playing 
across his mind. She was beyond any Angel, any being he had ever 
taken... perfection personified... He could almost feel her wings as 
they closed around him, forcing him down on her in her hunger... He 
could almost feel the ecstasy of plunging himself into her virginal 
body...

He pushed her and his fantasy away.

&quot;I said forget it,&quot; he growled. &quot;The Creator claimed you, and He would 
find out and we&#39;d both pay... The G.O.D. may rule Heaven, but He rules 
you. I have no wish to suddenly cease to exist.&quot; He crossed his arms. 
&quot;Why are you here, anyway?&quot;

Mary laughed, &quot;Why Mephie... I&#39;m crushed. You wouldn&#39;t brave 
nonexistence for...&quot; She pulled her trench wide and inhaled. &quot;Me?&quot;

Mephistopheles closed his eyes to keep from being driven to an attempt 
he was sure to suffer for.

&quot;Just answer the question,&quot;

If only she was serious and not just trying to lead me to my own 
destruction... the back of his mind whimpered.

Mary stepped back, the glint in her eye telling him that he may have won 
this round, but she was confident of getting him in the end. &quot;I heard an 
angel had Fallen, and was captured by a succubus who lived here. I came 
to either free her and slay her captors, or kill them all if she had 
already been corrupted.&quot; She paused and looked around the apartment. 
&quot;One may ask why you are here as well. Hoping to soil another angel?&quot;

&quot;I was. However, as you can see, there is no angel here.&quot;

The steely gaze she fixed him with left no doubt what she would have 
done to him if she had caught him defiling the angel, Demon Lord or not. 
&quot;So it seems,&quot; she said in an icy voice.

&quot;Now, now Mary, you know the rules. I&#39;m not a valid target. Hell needs a 
Lord of Temptation. I&#39;m just doing my job.&quot;

The look she gave him would have frosted the Lake of Fire. &quot;Oh, please,&quot; 
she snorted. &quot;As if there aren&#39;t a hundred other demons lined up to take 
your place.&quot;

Mephistopheles decided cowardice was the better part of valor and that 
leaving the apartment to Mary was a wise idea. &quot;I suppose I should be 
going now,&quot; he said as he began to fade into teleport.

&quot;You&#39;re up to something Mephie. What?&quot; Mary asked, her arms crossed.

&quot;I would stay to chat...&quot; His words faded as he did. &quot;But Bhaalor&#39;s...&quot; 
His last words were lost as he vanished.

Bhaalors? she thought. As in more than one?

She glanced around the apartment, trying to figure out what 
Mephistopheles had been searching for. Her eyes fell on the tarnished 
circlet. Her eyes hardened as a corona of silver fire flared around her, 
and she strode over to pick it up.

It was, or rather, had been, a silver halo.

Her corona flared even brighter as she hissed, &quot;You fuckers will pay for 
defiling an angel.&quot; She clutched the circlet tightly.

Suddenly, the apartment was filled with the roar of an inferno. Mary 
leaped to a standing position, her free hand drawing forth the Desert 
Eagle from her hip holster. The smell of brimstone was heavy in the air 
as six demons appeared, armed to the teeth. With a start, Mary realized 
what Mephistopheles had meant.

&quot;Well, well. Bhaalor&#39;s minions. How sweet. A welcoming committee for 
little old me?&quot;

&quot;Ah shit! It&#39;s the Iron Virgin!&quot; one of the demons exclaimed.

&quot;No matter!&quot; the leader yelled. &quot;There&#39;s only one of her and six of us!&quot; 
He gulped as Mary&#39;s pistol spoke and one of his subordinates&#39; head 
exploded. &quot;Umm... make that five of us.&quot;

&quot;Blessed bullets,&quot; Mary announced. &quot;I&#39;ve noticed your kind has an 
extreme allergy to them.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t scare me, bitch!&quot; the leader called, then looked at his 
subordinates. &quot;Get her!&quot;

As they lunged for her, Mary leaped up and grabbed onto the chandelier, 
releasing a spray of gunfire into the demons below. She hit another one 
dead between the eyes, and grazed the arm of a third, the halo dangling 
from her wrist like an oversized bangle. She got off another round, but 
missed as the chandelier gave and she fell towards the waiting maws of 
the demons...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lipton checked the address, then he checked it again, then a third time.

&quot;This can&#39;t be right,&quot; he muttered. &quot;I&#39;ve seen nicer crack houses.&quot;

But the numbers matched and there was nowhere else on the corner it 
could be. The building looked like a converted warehouse, fairly common 
in New York, and in typical New York contrast, it was just off a street 
full of high-rent high-rises. He supposed that in the dark, the fact 
that the block was deserted of all but derelicts might not be 
noticeable. A succubus could drain a man to a dry husk back here and the 
body would never be found.

He unpacked the twelve-gauge from his trunk to be on the safe side, 
double-checking to make sure the symbol laden slugs were still loaded. 
Blessed ammo, like all his guns, custom made for him by a friend who was 
a young priest and warded against evil with everything the Jesuit could 
dig out of the Catholic texts on exorcism. Never hurt to be cautious. He 
tucked a box of the slugs into his trench as well.

He kicked open the door, checking the hall beyond for demonic ambushers. 
When none made an appearance, he stepped inside. The hallway extended to 
a freight elevator, the doors to several apartments leading off. He 
tried the elevator, the noiseless ascension surprising him. The eerie 
silence of the building would have convinced him the place was deserted, 
but the sounds of gunfire upon his arrival at the top floor let him know 
otherwise.

He made his way cautiously across the high ceilinged area around the 
elevator over to the door through which the sounds had issued, 
completely unsurprised it was the succubus&#39;s apartment. He peered in the 
doorway, shotgun ready, then stepped into the room, his jaw slack and 
his eyes wide.

Three demons had gathered around a figure of feminine proportions. Two 
of them held the girl pinned while the third seemed to be tugging and 
slashing at the metal bikini bottoms the girl wore. His talons were 
leaving no mark on the metal, and even though his claws were making 
small scratches, they barely marked the girl either.

Suddenly, the faint silver nimbus around her flared. Her foot lashed out 
with a kick that buried the bladed heel of her boot into the crotch of 
the demon trying to remove her bottoms. The force of the kick viciously 
ripped the blade back out as the demon was flung across the room. He 
howled in fury and pain as she brought her arms together and slammed the 
others&#39; heads together. They fell back, dazed. In a whirl, she retrieved 
her Desert Eagle and rolled to her feet, allowing Lipton his first 
really good look at her. He nearly fainted in shock. He wasn&#39;t given to 
being easily impressed, but she was an awe-inspiring sight.

Silver fire burned around her like a candle flame flickering in a gale, 
illuminating the dark hair which flew about under the blue veil that 
covered the back of her head. Above the veil, an ornate golden halo 
crowned her, nearly blinding in its brilliance, the rays of light 
streaming from it illuminating the demons starkly. Her body was lithe 
and voluptuous, athletically formed and covered only by the minimal 
metal halter top and bikini. She had an ornate crowned dagger strapped 
to her right calf. Twin holsters on her hips held the Desert Eagles, 
while a pair of nines rested in the shoulder rig. Over her groin, and on 
both breast plates, was a symbol Lipton had seen many times, the two 
Greek letters Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. Her face was 
young; Lipton would normally have estimated her to be only about 
thirteen, but he knew she was much older, and none of the thousands of 
pictures he had ever seen of her came close to the reality. And he 
doubted that anyone would ever have envisioned her with the bloodlust he 
saw in her eyes.

She fired a shot at the demon whose crotch she&#39;d mutilated, his head 
exploding into so many bloody chunks, then she kicked at the one 
charging her from the left. He flew back, his face bleeding from where 
her heel had caught him, and she drew a bead on him. The third stepped 
quietly behind her, ruddy flames flickering along the blade he swung to 
decapitate her.

Lipton&#39;s shotgun kicked in his hand a second after the girl had fired, 
her bullet caving in her target&#39;s face. She whirled to see the last 
demon&#39;s corpse collapsing, most of his upper torso gone from the twin 
twelve-gauge slugs. She looked at Lipton, her eyes blazing. &quot;I had him 
covered!&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Lipton said sarcastically. &quot;I noticed.&quot;

For a second, the silver aura flared, tracing the pattern of glorious 
wings. It faded as she holstered the pistol with a huff, her halo fading 
to a simple gold circlet of light. &quot;What the fuck do you know anyway? 
You&#39;re just a stupid cop,&quot; she muttered.

&quot;Well, I can see we&#39;re just a two-thousand-year-old bitch, aren&#39;t we?&quot; 
Lipton responded angrily. &quot;One wonders how you ever got the reputation 
for being merciful or forgiving.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; She&#39;d frozen in surprise and was staring at him. &quot;You know 
who I am?&quot;

&quot;Lady, I&#39;ve seen a lot of pictures of you. None of them did you 
justice.&quot; He looked her up and down appraisingly. &quot;Sure as hell none of 
them ever captured this side of you.&quot;

&quot;Artists have their visions. I&#39;m under no obligation to live up to 
them.&quot; She cocked her hands on her hips and looked at him saucily. 
&quot;Still, I think Michelangelo captured me best.&quot;

&quot;What, a mother mourning her son?&quot;

&quot;No. A girl never allowed to blossom into womanhood.&quot; She plucked at the 
metal bikini. &quot;My husband played a rather nasty trick on me.&quot;

Lipton gave her the eye. &quot;I have bolt cutters in the car.&quot;

Mary laughed. &quot;I think I like you, Detective Lipton. Not many people 
with the Sight actually treat me like a person. It&#39;s refreshing. But I&#39;m 
afraid bolt cutters won&#39;t work. Believe me, I&#39;ve tried everything. Do 
you have any idea how frustrating it is being forever a 
hormonally-overloaded thirteen-year-old when you can&#39;t even get yourself 
off?&quot;

&quot;Umm... well, I suppose that could account for the psychotic look in 
your eyes a few moments ago,&quot;

Mary gave voice to a full throated laugh. &quot;No, Lipton. That&#39;s from two 
thousand years of devout Catholics whining at me to do something for 
them. After a thousand years of that, I got very fed up.&quot; She smiled 
coquettishly. &quot;You don&#39;t think that&#39;s unwomanly of me, do you?&quot;

Lipton grinned. &quot;Not at all.&quot; He gave her another look. &quot;In fact, I&#39;d 
have to say I&#39;d probably be the same way in your shoes.&quot; He looked at 
the wicked blades on Mary&#39;s boots again. &quot;Not that I&#39;d ever fit in your 
shoes, that is.&quot;

Mary sat down on a dusty easy chair, displaying herself to good 
advantage. &quot;So tell me, Detective. What brings you here?&quot; Her voice was 
sultry.

Lipton swallowed hard. &quot;Umm... I came to search the place.&quot;

Mary gave him a half lidded gaze. &quot;So... why don&#39;t you?&quot; Her voice left 
no doubt that she included herself in things to be searched. She toyed 
with an oversized hoop of tarnished silver around her wrist.

Lipton backed up a step. &quot;Um... actually, I can come back. Why don&#39;t we 
go for a slice of pizza, and you can tell me why the Madonna is in a 
succubus&#39;s lair.&quot;

She gave a disappointed pout. &quot;Ok... Pizza and an explanation... but 
only if you tell me how you knew a succubus lived here.&quot; She stood and 
sauntered to the door, picking up her trench coat from where the demons 
had thrown it. Lipton followed her, bemused by the weirdness of it all.

&quot;Pizza with the Virgin Mary,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Won&#39;t my Catholic friends be 
so impressed...&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Are you sure this is the place?&quot; Heart asked, looking up at the gothic 
facade of the three story building Seraph had parked in front of. &quot;This 
place looks so intimidating, and...&quot; She paused long enough to scrape a 
wad of bubblegum from the bottom of her shoe. &quot;...kinda dirty.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just out here, Beloved. It&#39;s kept low-key for a reason. It&#39;s 
much nicer inside.&quot; She looked around, noting that at least the exterior 
had been kept properly. No garish neon or tasteless ads, just the same 
old bronze plaque bearing the name &quot;Dante&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; she urged Heart as she headed for the massive double doors, 
solid oak slabs bearing a carved impression of an ornate double-ended 
trident that looked suspiciously like Seraph&#39;s own.

&quot;You said you could definitely get a job here?&quot; Heart asked, following 
her timidly.

&quot;Oh, definitely,&quot; Seraph said, opening the door for Heart. &quot;I&#39;m the 
reason Club Dante exists.&quot;

&quot;Okay, if you&#39;re sure,&quot; Heart said as she entered and stopped.

&quot;You worry too much, Love,&quot; Seraph laughed as she stepped around Heart 
and vanished through a curtain into the interior, leaving Heart alone in 
the antechamber.

Heart took a deep breath, and told herself it was only a room. No matter 
that the red lights overhead illuminated stark murals of the River Styx, 
or that the curtains of red and yellow streamers over the two doors to 
the main room gave the uncanny impression of being walls of flame, or 
that the marble floor was inlaid with a copy of the club&#39;s logo trident 
surrounded by Dante&#39;s most famous quote, it was not the Gate to Hell.

It just looked like it.

Heart took an involuntary step back. What she stepped into was not the 
exit door as she had been expecting. It was tall, and hard, and it had 
its arms crossed sternly. Heart let out a small cry and whirled around.

Facing her, muscles bulging against his tight tee shirt, was a man every 
bit as tall as Seraph. His arms were as thick as an average human&#39;s 
thigh, and his legs were like tree trunks growing from his hips. His 
thick beard was trim, neat and as blond as his streaming hair. His face 
bore the unmistakable stamp of Nordic ancestry, his square jaw and 
strong cheeks giving him a look of stern dignity. His ice blue eyes 
gazed down at Heart scoldingly.

&quot;You the owner of the Corvette parked outside?&quot; he demanded, his deep 
booming voice carrying a rumbling undertone like distant thunder.

&quot;Umm... no... My friend is,&quot; Heart said lamely.

&quot;Well, your &#39;friend&#39; needs to move it,&quot; the big man snapped. &quot;It&#39;s 
blocking our liquor delivery. We can&#39;t have that now, can we?&quot; He cocked 
his head to one side and gave her an appraising look, giving Heart the 
distinct impression he was stripping her in his mind. &quot;Say. You&#39;re a 
cutie. You new talent come to try out?&quot;

&quot;Umm... no... My friend is,&quot; Heart felt like a broken record.

&quot;You should try out too. The slobs who frequent this place would go 
apeshit over a beauty like you. I can see it now&#151;&quot; he unfolded his arms 
to size up the marquee in his mind. &quot;Club Dante&#39;s very own dancing 
angel.&quot; He interrupted his daydream to ask her &quot;What&#39;s your name again?&quot;

&quot;Heart,&quot; Heart said, backing up at the word angel.

&quot;Heart,&quot; he smiled. &quot;That fits. You a Dominion or a Virtue?&quot;

&quot;A Virt&#151;&quot; she broke off in shock. &quot;How- how did-&quot;

&quot;You angels are the only ones with those cockamamie halos.&quot;

Heart straightened her halo self-consciously.

The big man laughed. &quot;Ah, don&#39;t take it personally. I think yours is 
kinda cute. And the pink glasses are a nice touch.&quot; He stuck out his 
hand. &quot;My name&#39;s Thor.&quot;

Heart shook it lightly. &quot;Like the Norse myth?&quot;

Thor looked amused. &quot;No,&quot; he said jovially. &quot;Like Thor Odinson. God of 
Thunder.&quot;

Heart looked at him pityingly. &quot;The Norse gods are a myth.&quot;

&quot;Now who told you that?&quot; Thor still looked amused.

&quot;My... my superiors,&quot; Heart said, knowing in retrospect how lame that 
sounded.

Thor nodded. &quot;The G.O.D. has gotten pretty good at denying reality over 
the centuries. No, young Heart. The Norse Pantheon is no myth, any more 
than the Greek or Egyptian. Not many of us live in Asgard these days, 
though. Your superiors&#39; tactics of attacking our followers and their 
faith is rather effective. I didn&#39;t feel like surrendering to their 
dictatorship, so here I am. Bouncing in a tittie bar in Manhattan.&quot; He 
shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s a living.&quot;

&quot;A-a &#39;tittie bar&#39;?&quot; Heart looked confused. &quot;But Seraph called it a 
&#39;strip club&#39;.&quot;

Thor laughed even harder this time. &quot;Poor little angel. You need to get 
used to living in this plane. The humans call places like this a tittie 
bar, a strip club, a dance joint, even a gentleman&#39;s club. It&#39;s all the 
same place, a bar where women dance naked for money.&quot;

&quot;And men pay for that?&quot;

Thor nodded. &quot;Pretty good too. This place is classier than most, so it 
attracts the well-to-do set. The girls here can take home five to six 
grand a night. Some girls try for years to get a gig here, but the boss 
has standards. I&#39;ll say this for Miss Darkfell, she may never stop by, 
but she makes sure the girls are taken care of.&quot; His paused, his brow 
wrinkling. &quot;You know, your kind usually comes by here to cause trouble. 
I really hope that&#39;s not true in your case. I&#39;d really hate to snap that 
lovely little neck of yours.&quot; He stepped closer, looming over Heart.

She stepped back, alarmed. &quot;M-miss Darkfell?&quot; She stammered. &quot;B-but 
that&#39;s who I&#39;m here with!&quot; She didn&#39;t like the look in his eyes.

&quot;You?&quot; Thor shook his head. &quot;No way.&quot; He continued advancing.

Heart stepped back again. She could feel the blowing ribbons against her 
back, and the air from the fans was hot and dry. She realized she might 
have to do something to keep the huge man from carrying out his threat, 
and she reached into her purse, grasping the smooth wood of her sword&#39;s 
hilt. &quot;You&#39;ve never even met Seraph Darkfell, have you?&quot;

Thor shrugged. &quot;I doubt you have either, or you wouldn&#39;t be claiming to 
be her friend.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true! That&#39;s her car outside, and I came in here with her,&quot; 
Heart cried. &quot;Why won&#39;t you believe me?&quot;

Thor looked uncertain for a minute, then shook his head. &quot;You know, it&#39;s 
really not like an angel to lie,&quot; he said, anger in his voice.

&quot;I&#39;m not lying!&quot;

&quot;You really expect me to believe an angel is going to hang out with a 
succubus?&quot; He grinned ferally. &quot;No. I don&#39;t think so.&quot; He reached for 
her.

Heart stepped back, realizing too late that she&#39;d stepped through the 
curtain. She drew her sword and held it at the ready, fearfully eyeing 
the flickering wall of pseudo-flame...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Seraph strode purposefully towards one of the bars, her eyes taking in 
all the old familiar sights: the large overhead dome painted to look 
like the roof of Hell, grinning demon faces glaring down from nooks and 
crannies; the plush flame-stitched carpet; the antique iron and glass 
tables; the vast three-pronged stage with its brass railing and sturdy 
brass poles. She was happy to see so much of her handiwork and planning 
had gone unchanged. True, the current manager had replaced the murals on 
the walls with mirrors, and all of the couches and chairs with cheap 
black leather that didn&#39;t match the rest of the decor at all, but it had 
been about thirty years since she had last been here. Still, she had 
thought Monty had had better taste.

She could remember how much fun she had had setting the place up in the 
Twenties, first as a speakeasy, then, after Prohibition, as a 
gentlemen&#39;s club. It was one of the oldest such clubs in the city, 
having had several managers over the years, but only ever one owner: 
Seraph Darkfell. She&#39;d built the place with money John Jacob Astor had 
left to her following their affair on the Titanic. He&#39;d handed her the 
bank draft as he made sure she had a place on one of the lifeboats, 
thanking her for a wonderful voyage, and insisting it was a gentlemen&#39;s 
duty to stay behind and allow as many of the women and children to leave 
as possible. She&#39;d waited till he had left and gave her seat to a young 
black woman, winging off to try and get the desperate vessel aid. 
Unfortunately, she&#39;d gotten lost in the fog...

She&#39;d built the club in a style she thought he would have approved of, a 
mix of classical elegance and pure debauchery. The mirrors covered 
scenes which would have done her old home proud. She&#39;d kept a low 
profile over the years, allowing her managers to have mostly free rein 
in running the club. She just checked occasionally to ensure that her 
share of the club&#39;s payroll made it into her Swiss account. She&#39;d 
carefully overlooked the millions of dollars laundered every year by the 
syndicate she&#39;d chosen to protect the place. They maintained a low 
profile as well and made sure no one tried to muscle in on her 
ownership. It had been a mutually profitable arrangement and in all the 
years of the club&#39;s existence, it had never been raided.

She glanced around. A beefy bartender was wiping down the bar, a sour 
look on his face. A fat little man with a cigar sat at one of the 
tables, counting wads of bills and prepping the tills for the day. 
Neither was the man she sought.

The bartender spared her not even a glance when she approached.

&quot;We&#39;re closed,&quot; he said abruptly as she stepped up to the bar.

&quot;I know. I&#39;m here to see Monty,&quot;

&quot;No Monty here,&quot;

Seraph blinked in surprise. &quot;He&#39;s the manager,&quot;

&quot;Look, lady. I don&#39;t know what bar you think you&#39;re in, but it ain&#39;t 
this one. Ain&#39;t no Monty here.&quot; He turned his back on her.

&quot;No. It&#39;s the right bar,&quot; Seraph said icily. &quot;And when I find the 
current manager, you&#39;re fired.&quot;

The bartender threw a thumb over his shoulder at the fat man. &quot;That&#39;s 
the manager, sweetheart. Go ahead and try to get me fired. I wish you 
the best of luck.&quot;

Seraph smirked as she approached the little man. She sat down at the 
table and cleared her throat. The little man looked up at her chest and 
wolf-whistled.

&quot;Well, you&#39;re a tall one. Cute too. You here for a job?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Seraph replied. &quot;I&#39;m looking for Monty 
Scorciano.&quot;

&quot;Monty ain&#39;t here no more. He retired about eight years ago,&quot; he 
replied, his eyes never leaving her chest. Seraph smirked again and 
inhaled.

&quot;Did you take over for him?&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot;

&quot;And you are?&quot;

&quot;His nephew, Tony,&quot; the man replied, a sudden guarded look coming to his 
eyes.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Seraph said in sudden recognition. She remembered Tony, a chubby 
child in the early Sixties who&#39;d had a bad habit of grabbing the 
dancer&#39;s breasts. He&#39;d grown up into an obese man with the same beady 
eyes and the same bad taste in clothes. She wondered if he still grabbed 
the dancer&#39;s breasts.

&quot;Look, if he owes you money or something...&quot; Tony began.

&quot;No, he&#39;s been paying me just fine,&quot; Seraph replied with a wicked grin. 
&quot;Surely he must have told you I would be back eventually to check on 
things?&quot; she asked sweetly.

Tony&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; he demanded.

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember me, Tony? I used to sneak you candy bars backstage,&quot; 
her voice held a teasing lilt.

&quot;No way. You&#39;d be geriatric by now.&quot;

&quot;I age well,&quot; Seraph said coldly.

Tony&#39;s eyes narrowed suspiciously. &quot;Yeah? Prove it,&quot; he said, though not 
without some reservation.

Seraph rose and motioned Tony to follow as she led the way to the 
manager&#39;s office. It was done in antiques, and from the dust, had 
obviously never been used by Tony. Of course not. Can&#39;t see the show 
from in here, she thought as she crossed the room to a large painting 
behind the oak desk. It showed a scene from Dante&#39;s Inferno, where the 
narrator had encountered the circle of the sin of lust. Seraph stared at 
the painting of the lovers Francesca and Paolo, thinking They were truly 
in love, only the G.O.D.&#39;s Code made it a sin... So for love, they were 
damned... She shook her head and reached for the concealed latch. The 
picture frame swung away to reveal the wall safe. She spun the dial and 
opened it with a smile. Inside were several stacks of bills, over a 
quarter of a century old.

&quot;Oh, cool. Extra cash,&quot; Seraph exclaimed.

&quot;That safe is the property of this bar,&quot; Tony said uncertainly.

&quot;I know,&quot; Seraph replied. &quot;And&#151;&quot; She reached into her bosom and pulled 
out a key. She picked up the large iron box in the back of the safe and 
plopped it down on the ink blotter on the desk. Tony came over and 
looked on in interest as she used the key on the box.

Inside the box was a treasure trove of antiques: old photographs, 
newspaper clippings, and a thick file folder of paperwork. Seraph spread 
it all on the desk.

Tony Scorciano looked at the pile of pictures and newspaper clippings 
before him, his eyes wide and his jaw gaping. Here was a picture of 
Seraph, opening night, 1920. There was a picture of her on stage in the 
Fifties&#39; idea of sexy lingerie, teasingly pulling off an elbow-length 
glove. And here was a picture of her and her crew, a young Monty 
Scorciano looking proud in a new tux...

&quot;Wow... You did age well,&quot; he whispered.

Seraph smirked. &quot;Told ya,&quot;

A small stifled cry from outside the office brought both owner and 
manager running out to see what was wrong. Seraph put her hand over her 
mouth as Heart faced off, in a fighting stance, an invisible threat on 
the other side of the curtain. Her sword was drawn and gleaming.

Then the bulldozer piled through the curtain...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Heart looked up at Thor, eyes wide, and tried not to panic. Something 
about the man made her far less certain of winning this fight than any 
demon she&#39;d ever faced. Thor halted his advance when he saw her sword, 
but he grinned rather ominously. From his belt, he produced a massive 
iron hammer, its head fully as large as Heart&#39;s own. Small arcs of 
electricity played over its surface as his eyes danced gleefully.

&quot;It&#39;s really too bad your bosses won&#39;t let you believe in other 
pantheons,&quot; he said to Heart. &quot;Or perhaps you&#39;d know I&#39;m also a God of 
War.&quot;

&quot;Hell has a Horseman for that,&quot; Heart responded curtly.

&quot;Yeah, I know. Ares got fed up with fighting them after Constantine 
decreed everyone in the Holy Roman Empire had to become Christian or 
die, so he joined Hades in Hell.&quot; Thor shrugged. &quot;They offered me the 
job, but I hate horses.&quot; He twirled the hammer between his fingers. &quot;But 
that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not always looking for a good fight.&quot;

&quot;Who the hell is that guy?&quot; Seraph demanded of Tony as they watched the 
exchange.

&quot;Thor? He&#39;s the bouncer.&quot;

&quot;Thor? As in Thor Odinson? The bouncer?&quot;

Tony shrugged, gazing at the item in Heart&#39;s hand incredulously. &quot;Yeah. 
Best one we ever had, even if he is obsessed with using a hammer. She 
ain&#39;t gonna scare him off with that nail file.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Seraph replied. &quot;So good he&#39;s threatening my girlfriend.&quot; She 
straightened her skirt and stalked across the floor, allowing her shape 
shift to lapse. She marched up to the two glaring opponents, tail 
lashing.

&quot;Excuse me!&quot; she announced loudly to Thor. &quot;But would you mind telling 
me why it is you were about to try and hurt my girlfriend?&quot;

Thor glanced at her irritatedly, then did a double take as his jaw 
dropped.

&quot;This... this is...?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Seraph nodded.

&quot;But she&#39;s... but she&#39;s&#151;&quot; He pointed dumbly at Heart&#39;s halo.

&quot;I know what she is, Mr. Odinson. And what a shock that must be. But I 
would appreciate it if you would stop threatening her. Immediately,&quot; 
Seraph said menacingly.

Her tone overcoming his shock, Thor demanded. &quot;Yeah, well who the hell 
are you to be telling me what to do?&quot;

Tony stepped up. &quot;Thor, I&#39;d like you to meet Miss Darkfell, the owner of 
Club Dante.&quot;

Thor gave Seraph a look-over, from wingtips to hooves. &quot;I should have 
guessed.&quot; He turned to Heart. &quot;My apologies, Miss Heart. Like I said, 
it&#39;s not like you types to lie. I hope there&#39;s no hard feelings, it&#39;s 
just business.&quot; He replaced his hammer and scratched his head as he 
looked at Seraph. &quot;She&#39;s your what?&quot;

Heart beamed as she latched onto Seraph&#39;s arm and held it.

&quot;Girlfriend,&quot; Seraph repeated firmly.

Thor looked from one to the other, then shook his head. &quot;Never would 
have figured.&quot; He stuck out his hand. &quot;My apologies to you too, Miss 
Seraph. Just trying to keep the Club safe.&quot;

Tony looked at the diminutive form of Heart. &quot;From her?&quot;

Thor gave Tony the evil eye. &quot;Yeah, from her. She&#39;s more than you&#39;d 
think, Tony. I ain&#39;t a hundred percent sure I&#39;d have succeeded in taking 
her. Ninety nine maybe, but not a hundred.&quot; He looked back at Seraph, 
still holding out his hand. &quot;Or you either.&quot;

Seraph finally took Thor&#39;s hand. &quot;Well... umm... I suppose I&#39;ll consider 
that flattery.&quot;

Thor grinned. &quot;Naw. If I was flattering you, I&#39;d say you could take 
Sif.&quot; He laughed and turned to exit. Heart watched him vanish through 
the curtain again before dropping her sword into her purse and turning 
to Seraph.

&quot;Wow, what a big mean guy.&quot;

&quot;Beloved, whatever started that?&quot; Seraph asked, looking at the ceiling, 
afraid of the answer.

&quot;Umm. Well, he thought I must be here to cause trouble because... 
well...&quot; She looked up at her halo.

Seraph sighed. &quot;That&#39;s what I was afraid of. Well... at least he knows 
the truth now.&quot;

&quot;So... let me get this straight...&quot; Tony said looking eagerly at the two 
girls. &quot;You two are lesbians?&quot;

Heart only looked puzzled, but Seraph said, &quot;Yes. Passionately.&quot;

Tony rubbed his hands together. &quot;Well... that could be interesting. A 
lesbian dance act! The two of you up there, dancing together. The men 
wanting both of you... &#39;cuz everyone knows all men want two women at 
once...&quot;

&quot;Umm... I don&#39;t dance sir. At least... not like that,&quot; Heart said 
demurely.

&quot;Oh, come on.&quot; Tony cajoled. &quot;It&#39;s not that hard after the first few 
times. At least, that&#39;s what the girls say...&quot;

&quot;No sir, thank you,&quot; Heart looked a little uncomfortable.

&quot;But it&#39;s good money...&quot;

Seraph&#39;s hand gripped Tony&#39;s shoulder and bones creaked. &quot;She doesn&#39;t 
dance.&quot;

Tony gasped in pain and cried, &quot;Ok, ok... She doesn&#39;t dance!&quot; He looked 
relieved as Seraph&#39;s hand released.

&quot;Of course&#151;&quot; Seraph added. &quot;&#151;I do.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;Starting tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Yes, of course.&quot;

&quot;You saw the deed?&quot;

&quot;No, but I don&#39;t have to. Uncle Monty told me you&#39;d be the only one with 
a key to that lockbox, and would know the combination to the safe. Don&#39;t 
worry, Miss Darkfell, he told me to treat you like you was the Don, 
himself.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m flattered, but just now, I need a place to work. I&#39;m just here to 
dance.&quot;

&quot;You...&quot; Tony stopped. &quot;You just wanna dance?&quot; He looked around. &quot;You&#39;re 
not here to take the place back over?&quot;

Seraph laughed. &quot;Why do you think I hired your uncle in the first 
place?&quot; she asked. &quot;The business end of the club bores me to tears, 
Tony. No, I&#39;ll check things out of course, but so long as you&#39;ve been 
doing a good job of managing, you can keep it.&quot; She looked around. &quot;But 
some of this decor has got to go.&quot; She looked back at Tony. &quot;I will not 
dance in a tacky club.&quot;

Tony looked mildly offended, but only nodded.

&quot;Umm... Excuse me,&quot; a rather despondent voice interrupted.

Seraph and Tony turned to see the bartender, who was looking down at his 
feet.

&quot;What&#39;s up, Guido?&quot; Tony asked.

&quot;Well... I guess I need to tender my resignation,&quot; he said sourly.

&quot;What?&quot; Tony looked shocked.

&quot;Miss Darkfell said I was fired. I figure I&#39;ll save her the trouble. 
Besides, it&#39;ll look better when I&#39;m looking for a new job.&quot;

Tony looked at Seraph, but it was the big-eyed gaze Heart gave her that 
made her swallow.

&quot;Beloved?&quot; Heart asked.

Seraph looked down at her hooves. &quot;You&#39;re not fired. You didn&#39;t know who 
I was. I for-for-for&#151;&quot; She strangled on the word.

&quot;You&#39;re forgiven, for whatever it was,&quot; Heart finished for her, poking 
her head from under Seraph&#39;s arm. Seraph nodded fiercely.

Guido looked at the pair of them for a minute, then shrugged. &quot;Thanks, 
boss.&quot; He turned and went back to the bar.

&quot;You&#39;re so wonderful, Beloved,&quot; Heart said, beaming.

Tony had raised an eyebrow at the exchange, but kept silent. Seraph 
blushed at the praise.

Heart was looking around at the club. &quot;So this is a strip joint? Aren&#39;t 
the mirrors kinda tacky?&quot;

Seraph sighed. &quot;It used to have murals, Love.&quot; She turned to Tony. 
&quot;Please tell me whoever had those awful mirrors put up didn&#39;t paint over 
the walls?&quot;

Tony looked defensive. &quot;No... I just had them mounted over so the 
customers could see the dancers better.&quot;

&quot;No... You mean so that no matter where you looked you could see them. 
Please don&#39;t try to hide the fact you like looking at the girls, Tony... 
I like the fact you like looking at the girls... it means you&#39;ll make 
sure the girls that work here are worth looking at. But the mirrors have 
to go. I had to go through Hell to get Waterhouse to paint those murals, 
and had to delay the grand opening a year while he painted them.&quot; She 
looked down at Heart. &quot;They had better not be too damaged. You have no 
idea how hard it was to get the pictures he worked from. Charon had to 
make me waste a good fifteen plates being a ham, and it took forever to 
talk Cerberus into allowing me to enter with the camera. Then, trying to 
get everyone organized properly for the orgy was just hell. They all 
wanted to make sure I got their best sides and Helen and Paris insisted 
that they had to be the centerpiece, which of course started an argument 
with Cleopatra and Mark Anthony. I swear... If they hadn&#39;t all already 
been dead, I&#39;d have killed the lot of them!&quot;

Heart was lost in giggles. Tony was just giving her a look that said, 
Oh, god... I work for a madwoman. Seraph rolled her eyes.

&quot;Oh! Never mind... just please get someone in here to remove the 
mirrors. Carefully!&quot;

Reassured she was at least functional, Tony nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll call my 
brother. He&#39;s got a business that restores old houses.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure. And he&#39;ll split the bonus for finding him the job with you. 
Tell him I&#39;ll triple it if he can get it done by tomorrow night. And 
double that if he can get a painter to restore the murals exactly.&quot;

Tony blanched.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Tony. I&#39;ll cover the bonus personally, but the restoration 
had better be perfect.&quot;

Tony nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll tell him Miss Darkfell.&quot;

&quot;Oh, fer Chrissakes! Call me Seraph.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Seraph,&quot;

There was the beginning of respect in Tony&#39;s eyes that hadn&#39;t been there 
before. He&#39;d looked at her as a sex toy, then a nuisance that was going 
to cost him his job, then as a sucker to be fleeced, but now he was 
beginning to respect her as his boss. Seraph wasn&#39;t too worried about 
him. Monty wouldn&#39;t have placed him as manager if he wasn&#39;t a damn sight 
more than competent. He might be an obscene, vulgar little man, but he&#39;d 
get the job done... and make a profit doing it.

Heart had recovered from her giggling fit. Seraph smiled at her.

&quot;I still have to put away some papers, love, then we&#39;re finished here.&quot;

&quot;I take it that everything went well?&quot; she asked brightly.

&quot;Well enough. I&#39;m going to start tomorrow night.&quot; She looked at Tony. 
&quot;Right?&quot;

Tony looked up from the small notepad where he was jotting down Seraph&#39;s 
orders on his to-do list, not minding in the least that he was 
addressing Seraph&#39;s oversized breast instead of her face. &quot;Absolutely.&quot;

Seraph took Heart&#39;s hand and led her to the manager&#39;s office.

&quot;Oh! Pictures!&quot; Heart exclaimed on their entry. She plucked them from 
the desk and began going through them. Seraph froze, worried. Most of 
those were... well... explicit.

&quot;Beloved?&quot; she asked nervously.

Heart didn&#39;t notice, too absorbed in looking at the pictures. She&#39;d 
examine each one for long moments, then go to the next. The silence grew 
longer as Seraph&#39;s heart sank.

Finally Heart reached the last photo.

&quot;Beloved?&quot; Seraph whispered.

Heart looked up at her. &quot;Hmmm?&quot;

&quot;I-I&#151;&quot; Seraph couldn&#39;t think of anything to say.

&quot;Beloved? Are you okay?&quot; Heart asked worriedly, her face immediately 
concerned.

Seraph blinked. &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Love?&quot; Heart asked.

&quot;I-I thought...&quot; She gestured at the pictures.

Sudden understanding hit Heart. &quot;Did you think I would be upset by those 
pictures?&quot;

Seraph nodded, looking downcast.

Heart reached up and cupped her face as she drew her down for a kiss. 
&quot;Now, why,&quot; she asked, &quot;would I be upset at pictures of my Beloved, who 
just happens to be a succubus, being herself?&quot; She kissed Seraph again. 
&quot;I like looking at you Seraph, and I like looking at pictures of you 
too. I was a little worried myself, but now that I&#39;ve seen them, I can&#39;t 
be jealous. You look so happy in them. But you know something?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t look anywhere near as happy as you do when you&#39;re with me.&quot; 
She gave Seraph a stunning smile, then reached down to pull one 
particular picture out of the pile. &quot;Besides, I kind of like this one. 
Can I keep it?&quot; She held the photo out for Seraph to see.

She blushed right down to her hooves. It was a full nude of her in one 
of her more athletic poses, in full succubus form &#151; not that many 
mortals would have been able to see that &#151; but it was particularly 
explicit.

&quot;Ummm...&quot;

Heart kissed her again. &quot;Thank you, Beloved!&quot; She looked at the picture 
again and gave Seraph a sidelong look over her glasses. &quot;However, you 
will have to demonstrate that particular use for your tail to me 
sometime.&quot;

Seraph blushed more brightly. &quot;I must be rubbing off on you, Love.&quot;

Heart giggled. &quot;Why, love, of course you are. I love you, and as much as 
I love you, I also lust for you. And I noticed I&#39;m rubbing off on you 
too. I was very proud of you for forgiving Guido like that, even if you 
do still have a hard time saying it to anyone but me.&quot;

Seraph rolled her eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t help that, Love.&quot;

Heart smiled. &quot;I know. But you tried.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t rub it in,&quot; Seraph grumped, but her face said she was far from 
displeased. She sat behind the desk and sorted through the paperwork in 
the folder. Heart peered over her shoulder, then reached out to grab one 
that caught her eye.

&quot;Wow,&quot; she said, looking at the deed. &quot;You own this place?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, why do you think I was ordering Tony to take down the mirrors?&quot;

&quot;I figured you had charmed him or maybe had a history with him or 
something,&quot; Heart admitted. &quot;I mean... well... You are a succubus, love. 
It would be reasonable.&quot;

Seraph smiled. &quot;Yeah... but in this case, I actually do own it. I had 
this place built back in 1916. It took almost four years to track down 
an architect I liked to design it, get the permits, grease palms, and 
find craftsmen who met my standards. I wanted something that was mine, 
totally mine, from start to finish. I didn&#39;t get any help from Mephie, 
or any other agencies in Hell. I was given the seed money for the place 
by John Jacob Astor, a gentleman I had an affair with when I was on a 
vacation. We met on the Titanic and he treated me like a real lady. He 
listened to my ideas and respected my opinions and gave me pointers on 
how to accomplish what I wanted, then when the ship went down, he gave 
me a bank draft in apology for not being able to keep his promise to 
help me in person. I decided to keep the club very high class and 
upscale because of him. Building the place took another four years, and 
when I finally had it finished, Prohibition was in full swing, so I had 
to make it a speakeasy at first. That meant dealing with the Mafia.&quot;

She leaned back in the chair and pointed to a picture on the wall. &quot;I 
took the easy way out and found a local boss, a guy named Vito 
Scorciano. He had a knack for managing the books and looking legitimate, 
and he stayed low-key. The mob got its cut and a discrete place to 
launder money, so long as they kept their profile low. They kept it that 
way because Dante&#39;s attracted some very high profile clients, and they 
knew a good deal when they heard one.

&quot;Then World War I broke out and I was sent overseas by Mephie to 
entertain the generals. I sent Vito some acts I found in Paris and 
Berlin, and after the war, I hung out in Berlin for awhile, until Hitler 
came along and I had to go back to work. After that war, I came back to 
the States to find Vito had been killed in a mob war and that his son 
Monty had taken over the place. Monty was better at managing than Vito 
was, so I hung around for a few years and relaxed. Then Korea started. I 
was over there until Vietnam was in full swing and Bhaalor&#39;s troops 
started making everyone crazy. I came back here just in time for the 
whole hippie movement, and... well...&quot; She gazed into Heart&#39;s eyes. &quot;You 
know the rest.&quot;

Heart nodded, eyes shining. &quot;That&#39;s when we got assigned to neutralizing 
each other and started our duel.&quot; She smiled. &quot;Remember Woodstock? The 
beginning of the most wonderful time in my life?&quot;

&quot;How could I forget? We had just decided that killing one another was 
something neither of us had in us, and we&#39;d decided to settle things by 
you trying to prove to me that your virtue was more important than my 
vice, and vice versa. We tied that time. Five casual affairs to five 
true love matches.&quot;

&quot;And those were the five pairs we both hit,&quot; Heart reminded.

&quot;How could I forget? They were the ones that made us wonder if we should 
even be fighting. We&#39;ve discussed them how many times these last thirty 
years?&quot; Seraph laughed. &quot;And how many more did we both work on since?&quot;

Heart snuggled against Seraph. &quot;I lost count, Love, but the most 
important result of it all is our love. And you.&quot;

Seraph looked up into her angel&#39;s green eyes. &quot;You really think I&#39;m a 
wonderful part of your life, Beloved?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m an angel, Seraph. I can&#39;t lie.&quot;

&quot;You are so very wonderful though.&quot;

&quot;You are!&quot;

&quot;You!&quot;

&quot;No. You!&quot;

&quot;But, Beloved, you forgave me for all those pictures!&quot;

&quot;There was nothing to forgive. Besides, you were the one to save me from 
Bhaalors troops, and &#150; &quot; She raised a finger triumphantly. &quot; &#150; Thor!&quot;

&quot;Well... He was threatening you.&quot;

&quot;Yes. And you stopped him. That makes you wonderful.&quot;

&quot;But what about you?&quot; Seraph asked plaintively.

&quot;I must be wonderful,&quot; Heart kissed her neck. &quot;Because, after all, you 
love me, no?&quot;

Seraph smiled. &quot;With all my heart, Heart.&quot; She let herself get lost in 
the tiny angel&#39;s embrace for a small eternity.

Finally, Heart looked over to the desk. &quot;Let&#39;s get this stuff put away, 
Love.&quot; She started putting pictures back in the lock box. &quot;I want to get 
away from here for now. It&#39;ll take me a bit to get used to this place, 
and your manager unnerved me a little with the way he was trying to get 
me to dance.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about him, love. He&#39;ll behave himself around you from now 
on. I&#39;ll see to it.&quot;

&quot;And what did he mean by calling us lesbians?&quot;

Seraph stopped and looked to where Heart was still sorting pictures. She 
had asked that so matter-of-factly.

&quot;Um... Beloved? Do you know what a lesbian is?&quot;

Heart looked up. &quot;Yes. It&#39;s a mortal slang term for two women who have 
sexual relations. But why would that apply to &#150; &quot; She stopped and then 
looked down at herself. &quot;Oh. I never thought of that.&quot; She blushed. 
&quot;I&#39;ve been an angel so long I&#39;d stopped thinking about the fact that I 
prefer feminine form. It&#39;s not something angels think about.&quot; She sat 
down. &quot;I mean, I was female when I was a Mortal, but that was over two 
thousand years ago.&quot; She looked at Seraph. &quot;Do you think that was why 
Theliel was so mad at me for falling in love with you? Just because I 
prefer a feminine physical form?&quot;

Seraph put the folder back into the lockbox and closed the lid. She 
looked at Heart worriedly.

&quot;That&#39;s one thing I never really understood,&quot; Heart continued.

&quot;It&#39;s such an arbitrary rule and has nothing to do with the concept of 
Love. Love is Sacred, and the Soul is Sacred. The physical body is only 
a shell. The Soul has no gender beyond that of its own self image, and 
Love is above the restrictions of the physical. By all the definitions 
of Heaven, the body doesn&#39;t matter, and two souls can love one another 
regardless of the physical shell, so why does that aspect matter? Why 
does the Code condemn it among mortals?&quot;

Seraph had no answer. She shrugged.

Heart sighed. &quot;I&#39;ve always been bothered by that. Theliel has forced me 
several times to break up matches that involved same-gendered couples, 
and make new matches that weren&#39;t. In a very few of the cases, it 
produced a true love match, but in most cases, it didn&#39;t and the new 
couples were never as happy or as compatible as the ones Theliel had me 
break. I always thought I must have failed somehow.&quot; She looked up at 
Seraph. &quot;But did I? Or did Theliel?&quot;

Seraph stood and put the iron lockbox back in the safe and closed the 
picture over it. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Love. Do you think our love is unholy?&quot; 
She couldn&#39;t meet Heart&#39;s eyes.

But Heart&#39;s immediate response relieved her. &quot;No, Beloved. I know our 
love is holy because our love is true. True love can never be unholy, 
because it is a gift from the Creator and our own hearts.&quot; She stepped 
behind Seraph and laid against her back. &quot;He designed us to love, to be 
complete only with our soul&#39;s mate. Too often, we search for eternity 
and never find that one soul which will make us complete, but once we 
find them, there is no doubt. You complete me Seraph, make me feel 
whole... I could never think our love is anything but meant to be. No, 
the problem isn&#39;t with us, Beloved. It&#39;s with Theliel.&quot; She sighed. 
&quot;Exactly what his problem is though, I guess we&#39;ll never know.&quot;

&quot;All the more reason for you to go back to making matches, Love,&quot; Seraph 
said. &quot;You can finally set things right.&quot;

Heart smiled and hugged her tighter. &quot;See? You&#39;re being wonderful 
again.&quot;

Seraph blushed as she turned and returned the hug. &quot;Are you ready to 
go?&quot;

Heart stepped up on tiptoe, and still had to pull Seraph&#39;s head down for 
the long passionate kiss. &quot;Now I am.&quot;

They exited to the main room to find Tony waiting. &quot;My brother will have 
a crew here tonight at closing to remove the mirrors. We&#39;ll have &#39;em 
down by opening tomorrow. He also knows a guy who restores Waterhouses 
for the Museum.&quot; He checked his notes. &quot;That was the artist you named, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Thank you, Tony. That was fast work.&quot; Seraph was impressed. Monty 
had trained him well.

&quot;Anything else?&quot; he asked.

Seraph looked at the stage. &quot;Yes. Get someone in to look at the gas 
lines. I want to use the jets tomorrow, if I can do so without blowing 
the place up.&quot;

&quot;The jets?&quot;

She led him over to the stage and showed him the concealed gas jets. 
&quot;They put a border of flame around the stage.&quot;

Tony looked nervous. &quot;I ain&#39;t never seen &#39;em used,&quot;

&quot;Have them checked. If it&#39;s too dangerous as is, get them replaced as 
soon as you can.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; He jotted the note down.

Seraph linked hands with Heart and they walked towards the curtains. 
Right at the threshold, she paused. &quot;Oh, Tony? One last thing.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Miss Seraph?&quot; She winced, but she&#39;d break him of it eventually.

&quot;If you aren&#39;t using the office, could you have it cleaned for me?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

They nodded at Thor as they made their way outside to Seraph&#39;s Corvette. 
As Heart got in, Seraph pulled something out from under the windshield 
wiper.

&quot;Damn. Another ticket.&quot; She leaned over, opened the glove box, and added 
the pink slip of paper to a stack of similar ones over an inch thick.

&quot;Beloved?&quot; Heart asked. &quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to pay those?&quot;

Seraph looked at her and smiled. &quot;I am a demon, Beloved.&quot;

Heart laughed as they pulled out and away from the club.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mephistopheles stormed into the huge main room of his castle, fuming. It 
wasn&#39;t bad enough Bhaalor wanted his former best agent dead, now Mary 
was chasing Seraph too! He had to do something before he lost the 
opportunity to teach that bitch angel and that ungrateful whore who the 
true Master of Lust was!

He kicked aside one of the lesser succubae decorating the throne room 
with her naked form and stomped to his throne. Another succubus lounged 
on a pillow at the foot of the throne, on a duplicate of Lilith&#39;s place 
by Lucifer&#39;s. She gave him a raised eyebrow as she shifted, her long 
golden hair cascading down across the sheer see-through imitation of an 
angel&#39;s robe, while golden horns glittered under a silver hoop on a wire 
atop her head. He ignored her as he sat down heavily on his throne.

&quot;Faust! Get out here!&quot; he yelled, his head slumping to rest on his hand, 
his elbow propped up by the ornate throne&#39;s armrest. He stared sullenly 
at the many large screen televisions around the room, not seeing the 
mindless drivel on most of them. Only the blonde was watching anything 
besides soaps, her TV instead set to a documentary on ancient Greece. 
Finally, a tall figure wearing a business suit entered the throne room. 
He carefully stepped around the various succubae, incubi and lesser lust 
demons littering the room, finally stopping in front of the throne.

&quot;You bellowed, oh, Master?&quot; he asked, his voice honeyed condescension.

&quot;Have you found Seraph yet?&quot;

&quot;No. You know this. If I had found her, you would know that, too. Any 
other obvious things I can enlighten you on?&quot;

&quot;You do realize I could have you tortured in so many ways, right?&quot; the 
Demon Lord asked acidly.

&quot;In which case I simply go to work for someone else. Now which other 
Demon Lord would pay the most to learn all of your secrets, hmm?&quot; The 
amusement in the man&#39;s eyes was obvious.

Mephistopheles sighed. &quot;Find her. Before Bhaalor does. I have a plan to 
tempt the angel. I can&#39;t do that if she&#39;s dead.&quot;

The blonde succubus gave him the eye. He ignored it. She was only 
Seraph&#39;s replacement by default. She frowned and turned back to her TV 
in a huff.

Faust gave him a shake of the head. &quot;One hopes this plan will prove 
better than the last. This has turned into quite the little fiasco.&quot;

&quot;FIND HER!&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lipton sat on the pew looking at the statue of Mary and tried hard not 
to laugh. The young Jesuit priest finishing midnight mass just wouldn&#39;t 
have appreciated the joke.

As he waited, he reflected on his conversation with The Virgin, and 
debated whether he should tell the priest the woman he was praising as a 
paragon of virtue had spent most of the conversation coming on to him 
like a succubus in heat. He doubted Al Lorenzo would believe him. He&#39;d 
always been particularly prejudiced in that department. He never doubted 
Lipton&#39;s descriptions of the demons he&#39;d met, but he&#39;d never listen to a 
single criticism about the side he served, no matter how many of his 
preconceptions Lipton had discovered were wrong.

He watched the young priest drone on and considered the little bit of 
new information he had gotten out of Mary, but no matter how he looked 
at it, she had just raised new questions. He&#39;d discovered that succubae 
worked for Hell&#39;s Department of Corruptions, a rather amusing bit of 
information, and that the D.O.C. was run by a Demon Lord called 
Mephistopheles, a name he was familiar with from the writings of 
Christopher Marlowe. But none of this helped him figure out who Seraph 
Darkfell really was. All Mary had been willing to tell him was that she 
had heard that an angel was being held captive by a succubus.

As for the six demons they had slain in the apartment, Mary had told him 
that they had been low-level grunts from Hell&#39;s armies, which were 
commanded by a Demon Lord named Bhaalor. From the fact that she had told 
him they usually came in six-packs, he suspected the six demons in the 
alley had been Bhaalor&#39;s troops too.

It was interesting information to be sure, but not what he had been 
looking for. Most of the rest of the information he had tried to get out 
of the Queen of Heaven had been met with a pat reply of &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll tell 
you later...&quot; For all she had been willing to rant on how much she hated 
being whined at by the Church, or how lurid her tales of demon slaying 
had been, she&#39;d been rather closed-mouthed about the actual details of 
the Otherworld.

Still, he didn&#39;t think he&#39;d seen the last of her, and she&#39;d even given 
him a gift. The 9mm semi-auto held ten rounds and he had a full dozen 
clips, all personally blessed by Mary. It was a comforting weight in his 
coat pocket.

The priest finally finished saying mass to the almost empty sanctuary 
and stepped down from the pulpit. Lipton waited till the few people who 
requested blessings were done, then stepped forward himself.

&quot;Bruce,&quot; the young man said as he approached. &quot;Where have you been all 
week?&quot;

&quot;Busy, Al. Holidays always cause an upswing in crime. Valentine&#39;s Day is 
no different.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; the priest said sadly. &quot;That really is a shame. It is supposed to 
be a day of love.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but we both know people aren&#39;t always like that.&quot; He shrugged. 
&quot;Anyway, I got a case.&quot;

&quot;Yes? Is there anything I can do to help?&quot; Lorenzo looked around to make 
sure no one was observing them, then motioned Lipton back towards the 
offices. &quot;Within the bounds of reason, of course. I still can&#39;t give you 
a copy of the rites of exorcism.&quot;

&quot;Actually, this time, I need information of a different sort.&quot;

&quot;Oh? What?&quot;

&quot;Does the Church keep records of the activities of particular demons?&quot;

Father Lorenzo stopped and gave Lipton a hard look. &quot;Sometimes.&quot;

&quot;I need to know if they&#39;ve ever documented anything on a succubus by the 
name of Seraph Darkfell... and anything you can find on a pair of Demon 
Lords named &#150; &quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say them,&quot; the priest interrupted. &quot;Not in the Sanctuary.&quot; He 
motioned Lipton through a door into a small office.

After they had seated themselves, he looked at Lipton. &quot;Bruce... how do 
you get yourself involved in these messes? Two Demon Lords?&quot;

Lipton shrugged. &quot;What can I say Al? The case I&#39;m working on seems to 
involve the minions of both of them and I&#39;m trying to find out what the 
motives might be.&quot;

&quot;Which ones?&quot;

&quot;Mephistopheles&#151;&quot;

&quot;The Lord of Temptation and Lust.&quot;

&quot;And Bhaalor.&quot;

&quot;The Lord of War and Anger.&quot; Lorenzo shook his head. &quot;Why am I not 
surprised?&quot; he sighed. &quot;Well, I can tell you right off the top of my 
head that you don&#39;t want to try and go up against either of them 
directly. All the charms I could put on any amount of ammo won&#39;t even 
phase them.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not looking to fight them, like I said, this involves their 
minions.&quot;

&quot;May I know what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Basically, it seems that an angel fell yesterday, and six of 
Bhaalor&#39;s troops tried to grab her and rape her.&quot;

&quot;An angel?&quot; The priest was horrified. &quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yep. I saw her halo.&quot;

&quot;What color was it?&quot;

&quot;Silver.&quot;

Lorenzo nodded. &quot;That would mean she&#39;s a lower-level Angel. Against six 
of Bhaalor&#39;s minions, she wouldn&#39;t have had much chance.&quot; He crossed 
himself.

&quot;Hmm... interesting detail... I didn&#39;t know that. Anyway, these six 
demons were interrupted before they could do anything by a new arrival.&quot;

&quot;Another angel?&quot;

&quot;No... As best I can figure from the witness&#39;s testimony and my own 
investigation, it was Seraph Darkfell, the succubus I asked you to 
research. She killed the other demons and rescued the angel.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Blew my mind too,&quot; Lipton admitted.

Lorenzo looked disturbed. &quot;I don&#39;t like it. Why would a succubus save an 
angel?&quot; He thought for a second. &quot;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s unnatural.&quot;

Lipton shook his head. &quot;No, what&#39;s unnatural is the witness&#39;s story. She 
said they were acting like young lovers.&quot;

&quot;Blasphemy!&quot; Lorenzo exclaimed. &quot;Never!&quot;

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m only telling you what she said. All I saw was they seemed to 
be getting along fine. I saw them getting into a car together and it 
didn&#39;t look like the angel was protesting.&quot;

Lorenzo crossed himself. &quot;Such a thing would be the most unholy of acts. 
I can only suspect you must have either seen a demonic agent 
masquerading as an angel, or that the angel must be under some evil 
enchantment.&quot;

&quot;Well I don&#39;t know about the enchantment part, but I have it on good 
authority that the angel is indeed an angel.&quot;

&quot;Whose?&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe me if I did tell you.&quot;

&quot;Try me.&quot;

&quot;The Virgin Mary. I ran into her in the succubus&#39;s apartment. She&#39;s 
hunting her.&quot;

Lorenzo stared, then shook his head. &quot;I will never understand you, 
Bruce. The Lord has given you the Sight, yet you still reject his faith. 
The Holy Madonna would not be hunting succubae, Bruce. She is above such 
things.&quot;

&quot;Not from what I saw. Matter of fact, I&#39;d say she rather enjoyed killing 
demons. She killed five of them before I took out the last one.&quot;

Lorenzo held up his hand. &quot;Enough. I know we&#39;ve been friends since 
school, Bruce, but please don&#39;t mock the Virgin like that. If for 
nothing else but the aid I&#39;ve given you, show the faith at least a 
little respect.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay. I won&#39;t say anything else on the subject. But can you get 
me any info?&quot;

The priest sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll see if the library has anything on Seraph, but 
I can&#39;t make any promises. The Church records rarely deal with more than 
the Lords and their Lieutenants and high level minions.&quot;

&quot;Good enough.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll call you if I find anything. And, Bruce?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;You really should come to confession sometime. It would be good for 
your soul.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah. I know. You tell me that every time. My answer&#39;s still the 
same. You really don&#39;t want to know what I&#39;ve seen...&quot;

The Priest looked after him sadly as he exited the office. Such a pity.

&quot;Go with God, my friend.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lilith lay in Lucifer&#39;s bed in the castle and sighed. She&#39;d tired of 
Bhaalor rather quickly. There were, after all, only so many times one 
could listen to boasts, battle strategies, nefarious plots, and ranting 
about incompetent minions before even the Queen of Hell got bored. 
Bhaalor was rash, overconfident, and completely reckless with the lives 
of his troops, a perfect general for Hell&#39;s armies, but he was so... 
so... thickheaded. She&#39;d wasted a good hour fucking him only to find out 
his big plan for dealing with Seraph was to simply send in more minions 
until she was killed.

And the biggest waste was that Lucifer probably wouldn&#39;t even notice she 
had been unfaithful. Her infidelity games couldn&#39;t even get him aroused 
anymore. She thought back to the wildly passionate sex they&#39;d once 
enjoyed after she&#39;d seduced another person, how he&#39;d enjoyed the signs 
of another&#39;s spent passion upon her, all lost to her now. He&#39;d not 
touched her more than casually for centuries, and now, all his attention 
was drawn by the angel and the succubus.

She sighed yet again and rose to look over the balcony, contemplating 
how to win back her Lord&#39;s passion. Her eyes fell upon the stone set 
below the balcony on the bridge, and she thought fondly of her rape by 
all the Lords of Hell as she lay bound to that stone, being &#39;punished&#39; 
for Lucifer&#39;s rage over some trifle. She&#39;d rekindled his passion for 
almost three years with that little display. He&#39;d taken her on the stone 
himself, following the last Lord who&#39;d raped her, showing her less mercy 
and brutalizing her worse than any of them, as befitted the Master of 
Hell.

Now, nothing worked. Men, women, animals, toys, fetishes... nothing 
she&#39;d tried interested him anymore. They&#39;d done it all before. No matter 
how depraved, or violent, or painful, it just had no effect, and being 
an ignored wife was the most painful thing of all...

Inevitably, her thoughts returned to Seraph and Heart, and the 
love-making she had witnessed the night before. There had been... 
something... special about that. Something she just couldn&#39;t put her 
finger on about that magical blending of demonic and angelic auras...

With a small inrush of air, she returned to the mortal plane, arriving 
in her dimensional pocket just as Seraph and Heart returned from a night 
out.

The happy couple was dressed for a play, Seraph in a black satin dress 
that clung to the curves of her full bosom, but had no back, the top of 
the skirt beginning below the top of the cleft of her derriere. A long 
slit dropped down her left leg from mid-hip, revealing sheer black hose 
and the stiletto-heeled platforms she wore in human form to maintain her 
height. Her long white hair contrasted with the black satin, but it lent 
her an elegant look, despite her imposing height.

Heart was in a more business-like outfit that still displayed her 
voluptuous form, her white princess-cut top displaying her shapely 
cleavage. A short slit revealed the top of her white silk stockings, and 
the low-heeled pumps she wore had small gold ribbons that matched her 
belt. Her red hair was tied back with a gold bow at the nape of her 
neck.

So elegantly opposite, Lilith noted. As different as night and day, yet 
to look at them, you can see they compliment each other so well.

The pair entered the room singing and Heart executed a few neat dance 
steps as Seraph closed the door, the final twirl leaving her sprawled 
gracefully on the bed.

&quot;Oh, Beloved! That was a wonderful play! So romantic!&quot; She sang another 
verse of the aria.

Seraph smiled and stretched, letting her shapeshift go and returning to 
her true form. The reason for the low-cut back was readily apparent as 
she rubbed the base of her tail.

&quot;I wish one day humans would figure out that their chairs are murder on 
those of us with tails,&quot; she muttered as she stepped to a chair and 
swept her skirt out of the way to sit in it backwards. &quot;Yes, it really 
was very romantic,&quot; she answered Heart. &quot;But I felt sorry for the 
Phantom.&quot;

Heart sniffed. &quot;Me, too. He was so in love with Christine. Everything he 
did, no matter how bad, he did for her. If I&#39;d been assigned to his 
case, he would have won Christine&#39;s love. She inspired all of the 
goodness inside him!&quot;

&quot;Beloved, he was insane.&quot;

&quot;Only because he was unloved, Seraph. No one loved him because he was 
ugly! It&#39;s horrible!&quot; Heart replied. &quot;Christine loved him! You could see 
she did, right up until she found out what was under the mask!&quot; Heart 
pounded her fist on the bed. &quot;I could have made that love true!&quot;

&quot;But, Beloved, isn&#39;t that what she had with Raoul?&quot; Seraph asked, 
puzzled.

&quot;No,&quot; Heart said shortly. &quot;He was a convenient escape route. An excuse! 
She was shallow and vain and gave up her true love because she blinded 
herself to her own heart!&quot; Heart shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s like that story 
about the Hunchback or Beauty and the Beast. Esmeralda blinded herself 
to love because Quasimodo was ugly, but Beauty learned to see with her 
heart, not her eyes. Because she did, she found her true soulmate, and 
happiness beyond her wildest dreams.&quot; Heart jumped up and began pacing 
the room. &quot;It&#39;s like what we were talking about earlier, Beloved. The 
soul is what matters, not the package it&#39;s wrapped in! The body doesn&#39;t 
define it!&quot;

&quot;Are you still upset because Tony called us lesbians today?&quot; Seraph 
asked concerned. Heart was rarely this agitated.

&quot;No,&quot; Heart shook her head. &quot;In a way, I&#39;m glad he did. If he hadn&#39;t, I 
might not have noticed these things. When I think about all the lovers 
who have walked away from their true loves because they couldn&#39;t see 
beyond the surface, or were ripped away from their true loves because 
the Code said they couldn&#39;t be in love... of all the times I thought I 
was doing it in the name of Love!&quot; She snorted. &quot;And then I get my 
evaluation assignment, and I do something no other Angel of Love has 
ever done &#151; I showed a demon how to love &#151; and do I even get a pat on 
the back? A &#39;good job Heart&#39;? No. Theliel kicks me out of Heaven for 
it!&quot; She stopped in front of Seraph. &quot;I showed you how to love, and I 
gave my love to you, because you needed love, and because I needed you. 
And for that, Theliel wants to punish me. Is it because you&#39;re a 
succubus? Or is it because you&#39;re a woman?&quot; She whirled and stalked to 
the window.

Seraph looked at her, her heart in her eyes.

&quot;I mean, yes, you are a succubus, and by definition, all succubae are 
female. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. You can&#39;t change 
it, nor do I want you to.&quot; She gave Seraph a brilliant smile. &quot;But I 
could be male if I chose.&quot; She shimmered.

Seraph blinked as Heart changed. Where her beautiful angel had been 
stood a broad muscular man whose body could have been sculpted by 
Michelangelo. Heart&#39;s telltale red hair hung down his back, but where 
the soft curves of her full breasts had been was now hard muscle. The 
sheer fabric of her tortured dress defined the muscular outline of male 
legs and the faint outline of male genitalia.

&quot;Theliel knows this,&quot; male-Heart added, her voice crisp and deep. &quot;I was 
assigned to stop you by any means I could, to bring you to Heaven&#39;s side 
if possible, and I thought you would respond to me better as I was, so I 
stayed female.&quot;

&quot;Um... Beloved?&quot; Seraph interrupted.

&quot;Yes, Beloved?&quot; Heart replied, glancing at a Seraph who was looking 
rather pensive.

&quot;Could you please change back? That dress is definitely not cut to your 
proportions at the moment,&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; Heart said distractedly. She shimmered back to her normally 
lovely self. &quot;Anyway, we fell in love&#151;&quot;

&quot;Heart?&quot; Seraph interrupted again.

&quot;Yes, Beloved?&quot;

&quot;Promise me you won&#39;t do that again,&quot;

Heart nodded, but had a puzzled look on her face. &quot;Why, beloved?&quot;

Seraph looked down. &quot;You&#39;re going to think it&#39;s terribly silly.&quot;

Heart shook her head. &quot;I&#39;d never think you were silly, beloved.&quot;

Seraph gave her a shy smile. &quot;It&#39;s just, well, the female you is the 
woman I fell in love with. It&#39;s what I think of you as. I know you don&#39;t 
have a true gender, but I&#39;m used to you as a female.&quot;

Heart had to laugh. &quot;I like being a female, Seraph. I&#39;ve been female 
most of my existence. It&#39;s more comfortable.&quot;

&quot;Good. I&#39;m glad. I like you better as a woman.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my point, Seraph,&quot; Heart continued. &quot;Theliel knew I could be 
either sex, that my gender had no bearing. He could have simply ordered 
me to stay male. He didn&#39;t have to exile me! I did my job! I admit I 
certainly didn&#39;t expect to fall in love with you, but that only had 
bearing on my assignment inasmuch as it would aid me in winning you to 
Heaven&#39;s cause.&quot; She looked sheepishly at Seraph. &quot;Sorry, Beloved. I was 
hoping eventually to convince you to come to Heaven.&quot;

Seraph shrugged. &quot;And I was assigned to cause your fall,&quot; she said 
bitterly. &quot;Which in the end, is exactly what I did, whether I wanted to 
anymore or not.&quot;

&quot;Beloved! You weren&#39;t responsible for Theliel&#39;s behavior. I certainly 
didn&#39;t expect it. I filed a very positive progress report telling him we 
were in love and that I believed that love would work a wondrous change 
in you&#151;&quot;

&quot;Which it did,&quot; Seraph added.

&quot;&#151;and that I thought you would eventually come to Heaven&#39;s side, and he 
accused me of failing my assignment and betraying Heaven and then he 
exiled me!&quot; Heart sighed. &quot;Seraph? Lust, or what I&#39;ve learned of it, 
it&#39;s purely physical, right?&quot;

Seraph nodded. &quot;Mostly. There&#39;s a lot of complex mental stuff, and 
hormones and biological stuff, but most of the feeling is physical.&quot; She 
smiled. &quot;What you showed me was that while lust may consume the body and 
mind, it will fade as the biological imperative is met. Love provides a 
catalyst that allows lust&#39;s passions to be maintained indefinitely, as 
well as providing for needs beyond the purely physical. Lust may be the 
lighter fluid, but love is the flame.&quot;

Heart did a triumphant little twirl. &quot;Exactly! Love without passion is 
cold, remote, no matter how deep or strong. It&#39;s only when both fires 
are manifested that love reaches its full potential! I did not fail in 
my assignment! I was not corrupted! I was completed!&quot; She stopped 
suddenly. &quot;Could that be it? Was I not supposed to realize what love 
could be?&quot; Her eyes implored Seraph for an answer.

&quot;Beloved, I have no idea.&quot;

&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; Heart said despondently as she sat back down on the 
bed. Seraph looked at her lover in dismay.

&quot;I wish I knew how to cheer you up.&quot;

Heart looked up at the succubus through long sensual lashes, her 
rose-tinted lenses falling down her nose. &quot;Well...&quot; she purred. &quot;You did 
promise to show me something.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot; Seraph brightened. &quot;So I did.&quot;

Lilith watched as Seraph rose. That conversation had been very 
interesting. She wondered what the succubus was going to do now.

Seraph twisted into a well-placed kick, and the table silently slid to 
the wall as she dimmed the lights. Only the chair she had been sitting 
in remained. The radio turned itself on and began to search through 
channels until it found a piano intro into a song. Seraph smiled. 
&quot;Perfect. I like this version so much better than the country one. I&#39;m 
glad they made a pop cut.&quot;

The music went into a lull as Seraph struck a pose, her wings framing 
her in the light.

Is she finally going to show the angel her true powers as a succubus? 
Lilith wondered. This should be interesting.

Then, the song began...

For the brief moments of the song, time ceased to exist. For both the 
Angel of Love, and the Queen of Hell, there was only the music...

And Seraph...

The song was a simple ballad, the words solely praising a love so 
intense it was amazing, and Seraph brought the emotions of the song to a 
living breathing life. She started with a twirl that lifted her skirt to 
show her calves, the slit wrapping around to show a flash of her garters 
and the silky red panties she was wearing, but more than the dance was 
the aura Seraph exuded. She had released her abilities to evoke passion 
and as she danced, the subtle siren call of desire rose slowly to a 
fever pitch. As Seraph slowly removed articles of clothing and revealed 
more and more of herself, Lilith felt herself responding. No succubus 
she&#39;d ever encountered had had that effect on her, and that was 
peripherally; the effect on Heart was even more potent.

As the last of Seraph&#39;s clothes fell to the floor, the succubus moved to 
the chair and used it as a brace for some of her more erotic moves, 
using her tail and wings to teasingly hide, then reveal various part of 
her body.

Heart&#39;s face flushed with desire as she watched mesmerized.

Lilith fought against her own reactions, wanting to observe Heart&#39;s 
reactions to Seraph&#39;s revelation of her powers, and trying to figure out 
why Seraph&#39;s powers were so strong. If she could learn to imitate 
Seraph&#39;s aura, even Lucifer would be rocked by her hot wind. There was 
no demand to Seraph&#39;s call, no urge for immediate reaction, no push for 
a response to the silent wave of passion, yet it was all the more 
seductive for it. Without the overwhelming drive towards sex that a 
succubus&#39;s aura usually invoked, Seraph seemed more alluring, more 
desirable. Something lurked behind that call that Lilith had never felt, 
something that awoke yearnings within her she had never realized were 
there.

As Seraph concluded her dance to stand before her lover unconcealed, the 
last word of the song fading slowly, Lilith gasped, her body shuddering. 
In amazement, she looked down at her betraying hand, now slick and wet.

She&#39;d climaxed, and worse, she&#39;d been heard.

Seraph whirled. &quot;What was that?&quot;

Heart only had eyes and ears for her lover. &quot;What was what?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I thought I heard someone moan in orgasm.&quot;

Heart stood on the bed, bringing herself up to a height level with 
Seraph&#39;s. &quot;That was me.&quot; She took off her glasses and drew Seraph&#39;s lips 
into a long passionate kiss as she guided the Succubus&#39;s hand to the 
zipper of her dress. &quot;And now you&#39;re going to make me do it some more.&quot;

Seraph giggled as Heart was quickly divested of clothing, and the angel 
dragged the succubus down on top of her. Lilith sighed in relief, but 
could not bring herself to leave yet. She watched as the two made love 
again, their auras intertwining once more.

When it was over, Heart raised her head to look into Seraph&#39;s eyes, and 
smiled at the light that filled them. Lilith marveled at the ecstasy the 
succubus&#39;s eyes revealed. She had never seen a succubus who had ever 
seemed satisfied with a lover. Heart&#39;s &quot;I love you&quot; made Seraph stretch, 
looking down at the little angel. She reached down and tousled Heart&#39;s 
hair, mussed from their recent activity.
