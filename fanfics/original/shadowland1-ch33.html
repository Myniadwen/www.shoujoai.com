Council of Lords

Sophia sifted through a pile of paperwork that she found sitting on her 
desk the moment she arrived in her office first thing that morning. 
Small glasses perched on her nose as she tried desperately to find some 
order to the insanity. It was nearly lunch hour and she felt nowhere 
close to being finished when there was a light rapping upon her office 
door. 

&quot;Come in.&quot; She called out, not looking up from the papers. 

&quot;It&#39;s just me, Sophia.&quot; Amy said as she entered the room. The office was 
large with high ceilings that only made the room seem all the more 
overwhelming. The entire room was covered with deep crimson carpets. Two 
desks sat at the end of the room near a large window that covered the 
entire far wall. Bookcases stretched across the length of the walls to 
either side, with long rolling ladders stretching to the very top 
shelves. Melissa could be seen sitting at the top of one of the ladders 
reading a large, thick old book.

&quot;Hey there Amy!&quot; She waved from her spot and slammed the book shut 
before sliding down the ladder railings, nearly tripping and falling 
face first to the ground, recovering at the last moment to land on her 
feet. 

&quot;Melissa, I wish you would stop doing that.&quot; Amy shook her head slowly, 
&quot;I have enough trouble taking care of these girls that I don&#39;t need you 
taking up a bed.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Melissa said with a giggle and added the book she found to the 
mound that already was piled up on her own desk, &quot;What brings you?&quot; She 
asked while sifting through the pile in search of another tome.

&quot;Well for one we need to arrange the Elementary grade examination.&quot; Amy 
stated leafing through the papers in her hands, &quot;A few of these girls 
are in need of a check up. A couple seemed to have avoided the last 
one.&quot; 

&quot;That is right.&quot; Sophia peered up from her papers over the rim of her 
glasses, &quot;You did say you would be dropping by about that.&quot; She 
stretched in her tall leather chair, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I completely forgot 
about it.&quot;

&quot;And here I thought I was behind schedule and all after the incident at 
the Western Dorms.&quot; Amy said let out an exhausted sigh and flopped down 
in one of the high backed plush chairs set opposite the Head Mistress, 
&quot;This is going to be an interesting year.&quot;

&quot;Are those girls already getting into trouble already?&quot; Sophia asked 
taking off her glasses and rubbing her eyes, &quot;You are way to kind to 
those girls at times.&quot; 

&quot;No, there was no problem.&quot; Amy said, &quot;At least not for me. I do, 
however, wish I could do more for them. I wish there was some thing I 
could do to cure their tattered hearts.&quot;

&quot;So do I.&quot; Melissa agreed with a sigh and sitting upon the only edge of 
her desk that was not already occupied, &quot;There must be more we can do 
than just sit around here. Why can&#39;t we get involved more?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; Sophia said sternly, &quot;You know the rules. We just observe and are 
an ear for them to talk to. We are not allowed to interfere, and that 
especially goes for you, Missy. We don&#39;t want another incident like last 
time. I&#39;m still trying to sort everything out.&quot; She motioned to the pile 
of papers in front of her, &quot;We still don&#39;t know the full extent of the 
damage that was caused.&quot; 

&quot;True.&quot; Amy agreed then thought for a moment, &quot;Which reminds me, I 
wanted to talk to you about something else as well.&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; Sophia inquired. 

&quot;It is that red haired girl.&quot; Amy said milling over her words, &quot;She got 
a strange cut this morning and doesn&#39;t seem to respond to pain in the 
usual ways. Sure there are many who shut off the pain but the extent in 
which this child does is so extreme and supposedly she saw May Young in 
a mirror.&quot; 

&quot;May?&quot; Melissa glanced up from the book she had just opened. 

&quot;You should not have to worry about the child any longer.&quot; A deep voice 
said from a shadowy corner of the room. 

&quot;Milai, what are you doing here?&quot; Sophia asked, more amused to hear the 
sound of the man&#39;s voice then anything else. 

Out of a dark corner the masked man stepped into the light. His long 
cloak appeared more like an extension of the shadows than fabric, &quot;I 
hear that Aigneis has rejoined your lodgings and envisioned I would see 
how she was at.&quot; 

&quot;She is doing just fine, Milai.&quot; Melissa said cheerfully, &quot;I&#39;m glad to 
see you visited.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m delighted to hear that she is alright, however I can only stay for 
a time.&quot; He stated tonelessly, &quot;The Halls await me. I do bring a 
warning; my sisters have been neglecting their duties to visit this 
place. They may be near and far. Thus bring troubles with them.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for the news.&quot; Sophia said with a smile, &quot;We&#39;ll keep and eye 
out for them. Please give your Father my regards.&quot; 

Milai bowed deeply, &quot;I will see to that.&quot; He then drifted back into the 
shadows, &quot;It was good to see you all again. Aunt Sophia, Aunt Melissa 
and you too Amy.&quot; He vanished into the darkness. 

Sophia dropped heavily into her seat, &quot;So we have a couple more girls to 
watch out for it would seem.&quot; She spun the chair around and gazed out 
the large window, &quot;We have our work cut out for us it would seem.&quot;
