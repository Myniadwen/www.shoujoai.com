Darkness Amongst Darkness

Akaime marched down the streets. He was beyond displeased with the way 
the situation had evolved out of his control. The girls should be 
cowering in a corner by now, too terrified to even raise a hand to him. 
Not even able to run and yet here they are scampering about, forcing him 
to search for them time and time again. He touched one of the freshly 
made cuts in the skin of his false face and winced as they stung. That 
angel was not part of his plans either. He was so deep in his thoughts 
that he almost didn&#39;t notice one of the girls as she darted down a road 
turning just in time to see a fleeting glimpse of red hair. The game was 
on again and a grin crossed his face. 

*****

Kima ran around yet another corner to find Natalie awaiting her arrival. 

&quot;Are you really sure about this idea?&quot; Natalie nervously asked, &quot;I mean 
this is out of the ordinary.&quot; 

&quot;And so am I.&quot; Kima&#39;s smile made a shiver creep up Natalie&#39;s spin. 

&quot;You can be a very spooky girl. I never really realized that before.&quot; 
Natalie remarked.

&quot;There are many side to me that you have yet to meet.&quot; Kima stated then 
jumped over a fence, &quot;Come on, everyone is waiting.&quot; 

&quot;Just for the record: This is insane.&quot; Natalie then followed the girl 
just as Akaime came around the corner. 

******

&quot;So while the other two are playing bait, what do we do exactly?&quot; Tanya 
asked, still not understanding what was going on. She walked along side 
Alyson with Cherilyn holding close to her side. 

&quot;We protect her.&quot; Alyson pointing at Kim while repeating what Kima had 
told her, &quot;Kris is checking on her sister while we get Kim safely to 
those apartments.&quot; She pointed to some buildings in the distance. 

&quot;Then what?&quot; Tanya asked. 

Alyson shrugged, &quot;We wait and see what happens.&quot;

&quot;This doesn&#39;t sounds like such a great plan.&quot; Tanya admitted. 

&quot;Well, you have any other options to add?&quot; Alyson encouraged, &quot;We would 
be open to another way to resolve this situation.&quot;

Tanya thought for a moment then shook her head. 

&quot;Then we continue as we were told.&quot; Alyson stated, promptly ending the 
conversation.

Jenn walked along side Kim, not able get her mind off that kiss or off 
Kris. She glanced behind herself in search of her friend to find she was 
nowhere in sight, then turned back to look at Kim one more time. She 
found herself doing this several times over again. First searching for 
Kris and then returning to Kim. Her head felt muddled and confused, her 
memories were colliding into each other and contradicting each other. 
She had only met Kim a couple of days ago, however she now clearly 
remembered meeting her before that. She also was almost certain that she 
first met Kris just last year and yet her heart kept telling her it had 
been much longer then that, so many new thoughts and emotions that she 
felt a need to scream or just fall into a deep slumber. She turned to 
look at the girls behind her and her eyes fell upon Tanya, one of her 
oldest and dearest of friends and she suddenly back stepped so she was 
walking along side the girl. 

&quot;Tanya..?&quot; Jenn asked timidly. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; Tanya gave the girl a beaming smile. She seemed to be handling 
the whole situation rather well, or was just very good at concealing her 
own fears. Her smile faded when she saw the sad worried look in her 
friend&#39;s eyes, &quot;What&#39;s bothering you?&quot; She asked concerned for her 
friend.

Jenn rubbed her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She said, struggling to keep her 
emotions under some kind of control, &quot;Everything feels... so messed up. 
Nothing is making any sense and I don&#39;t know what is real anymore.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Tanya lowered her head to gaze at her feet, &quot;I know what you 
mean.&quot; 

&quot;We have been friends since Kindergarten, right?&quot; Jenn asked, unsure of 
her own memories. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Tanya said with a smile, &quot;We all were taken to that special 
school because we had &#39;problems&#39;.&quot; She stated with a cynical giggle, 
&quot;Like that would help. It just caused us more problems and worries. 
Being an out patient at that place just singled us out from the other 
kids in the neighbourhood.&quot; 

&quot;What school?&quot; Jenn was startled by this notion; &quot;I thought we went to 
an ordinary school together?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Tanya gave the girl an unusual look, &quot;You really don&#39;t remember do 
you?&quot; She asked cautiously. 

Jenn shook her head, &quot;Nothing is clear anymore. Things are coming back 
but are mixed up. I&#39;m not sure what is real anymore.&quot; 

&quot;That is why we&#39;re at the academy.&quot; Cherilyn finally spoke up, her voice 
low as if she were afraid someone might hear her, &quot;We all have some kind 
of darkness inside of us. A lot of us start by visiting during school 
hours and going home afterwards while many others end up living there 
soon after. Almost everyone can&#39;t remember why they are there at first.&quot; 
She shrugged and drew silent. 

Jenn thought about this carefully, &quot;They why do I remember other 
things?&quot;

Alyson gazed up at the sky, &quot;Because our minds will not let us face the 
truth.&quot; She stated, closing her eyes then turning and looking at Jenn 
again, &quot;Our minds are trying to protect us and at the same time they are 
hurting us. We end up forgetting the good with the bad. Being haunted by 
nightmares without understanding their nature and in the end being torn 
apart by our own memories.&quot; She let out a deep sigh, &quot;This is the nature 
of our souls and I guess why we are all here.&quot;

Jenn glanced up at Kim who looked back at her then turned away quickly. 
Now her mind felt more a mess then before and she fell back into 
silence, being consumed by her thoughts.

*****

After seeing Akaime follow Kima down the road Kris came from her hiding 
place beneath a large pine tree and quickly headed back towards the 
mobile homes. It didn&#39;t take her much time to back track and she was 
stunned by the amount of chaos that was left over from the battle. At 
least three houses were torn to shreds with pieces of plywood scattered 
across the road and Kris had to search some of the wreckage before she 
found her sister laying on her back with her eyes closed. If Kris had 
not known better she would have thought her sister to be dead, but there 
has yet to be anything that could kill one of her family... Hurt them, 
yes. Kill them... that was another story. She herself was unsure if 
death could come for her now that she was no longer one of the sisters. 
The idea had crossed her mind many times over the years, but she had yet 
to try to test that theory.

She lifted a few pieces of wood off her sister and the angel&#146;s wings 
flickered and faded transparent a couple of time. Kris took this as a 
good sign that her sister was surely alive, &quot;Hey sis?&quot; She bent over the 
girl closely so she could listen for her breathing. 

&quot;Unnn...&quot; Gwen muttered, &quot;owwww...&quot; she moaned again. 

&quot;Gwen!&quot; Kris sat up, excited to see her sister starting to stir, &quot;I was 
beginning to worry.&quot; 

Gwen opened one eye and peered up at her little sister, &quot;I&#39;m not going 
to die if that is what is worrying you.&quot; She lifted a hand to her head 
and rubbed her forehead, &quot;What hit me?&quot; She asked groggily. 

&quot;A very big man.&quot; Kris replied, &quot;I never thought someone could knock you 
flying like that. What is he?&quot;

&quot;A faceless.&quot; Gwen answered while trying to sit up. Her back ached and 
her arm hurt and she struggled to conceal her pain. 

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen a faceless like that.&quot; Kris stated worriedly, &quot;There is 
something strange about that one.&quot;

&quot;He was a man, a dream ghost.&quot; Gwen corrected herself, &quot;And somehow he 
merged with a Faceless becoming something else, a creature that grows 
with strength in dreams and feeds on fear. He needs to be stopped.&quot; 

&quot;How can such a thing exist?&quot; Kris asked, helping her sister to her 
feet. 

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t...&quot; Gwen stated shaking her head in dismay, &quot;Morrigan said 
he was in a line-up to death&#39;s corridor when she stumbled upon that red 
haired girl and the next thing she knew he was missing. She thinks that 
he might have followed the girl and escaped.&quot;

&quot;Kim?&quot; Kris became more worried, &quot;What was she doing there?&quot;

&quot;Searching for your friend.&quot; Gwen added trying to shake the last of the 
light-headed feeling from her, &quot;Your friend was being haunted by a 
faceless for the past while, a faceless that had taken the shape of one 
of her dead friends. I thought you of all people would have noticed that 
girl was not real when you were in her dream.&quot;

&quot;May...&quot; Kris shook her head in dismay, &quot;I felt she didn&#39;t belong, but I 
just thought she was another ghost of the dream.&quot;

Gwen shook her head in disappointment, &quot;You were never any good at 
sensing those kinds of things. I shouldn&#39;t have allowed you to enter 
that girl&#39;s Dream Sphere in the first place.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Kris apologized sadly, &quot;I just wanted to be with her.&quot; 
She lowered her head in shame, &quot;I thought I could help free her.&quot;

Gwen patted the girl on the shoulder, &quot;I know... I know...&quot; She scanned 
their surroundings, &quot;Where are your friends by the way?&quot;

&quot;They think they can stop that monster.&quot; Kris stated, still unsure of 
their plans. 

&quot;How, in the name of our father, are they going to do that?&quot; Gwen asked, 
shocked to hear about this turn of events. 

Kris only shrugged, &quot;We need to hurry. They are heading for those 
apartments.&quot; She pointed in the distance. 

&quot;Hang on.&quot; Gwen wrapped her arms around Kris&#39;s waist; spread out her 
wings full and took flight. 

*******

&quot;Hurry up!!&quot; Natalie called out behind her as she ran down another back 
alley. 

&quot;I&#39;m... trying...&quot; Kima panted taking a glimpse behind herself to see 
Akaime was following close behind, &quot;Maybe this wasn&#39;t such a good idea.&quot; 
She remarked as the man closed in on her. 

&quot;You think so!?!&quot; Natalie said with a snarl. The apartments could be 
seen just ahead of them, &quot;We are almost there.&quot;

Kima stumbled and fell the to ground, scraping her knee and hands, 
&quot;Nat!!!&quot; She cried out as she tumbled to the ground. 

Natalie spun around, &quot;Kima!!!&quot; Akaime was already upon the girl. He 
grabbed Kima by the scruff of her overalls and slammed her up against a 
brick wall with a thud. 

&quot;Enough of these game, princess.&quot; He snarled at the girl, &quot;It is time 
for you to return to where you belong.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not going anywhere with you.&quot; Kima struggled against the man&#39;s 
grip, &quot;Leave me alone!!&quot; She yelled. 

&quot;Let... her... GO!!&quot; Natalie flung herself at the man and kicked him in 
the side, having little effect. 

Akaime glanced down at the girl, not even flinching at her efforts, 
&quot;I&#39;ll deal with you later, cousin.&quot; With one swing of his arm he hit 
Natalie across the side of the head, knocking her into a pile of 
trashcans.

&quot;NAT!!!&quot; Kima cried out, &quot;Don&#39;t you hurt her!&quot;

&quot;No worries.&quot; Akaime turned back to face Kima, &quot;I have plans for her.&quot; 
He said with a sinister grin. 

Natalie shoved the garbage out of her way and sprung to her feet. Her 
fear of the man had been replaced with a rage that boiled from the 
depths of her heart and a need to protect her friend. She clenched her 
fist and a long blade sprung forth from beneath her sleeve. Unlike her 
normal blade this one shimmered with glowing blue light. Akaime was to 
busy struggling with Kima to notice the blond approach from behind him 
and she jammed the entire blade&#146;s length into his side with all her 
might. He screamed in agony as Natalie twisted the knife, blackness 
oozed forth from the wound. Akaime dropped Kima and turned on Natalie. 

&quot;You little...&quot; He reached out for the girl only to have her produce 
three little daggers between the fingers of her other hand and stab them 
deep in to his leg. She pulled out the blade causing a tar like 
substance to come spluttering out then the darkness suddenly changed and 
became a tattered cloth, like some strange silk cloth a Magician would 
pull from his sleeve, but if the sleeve was a hole in the side of a man. 
The cloth fluttered for a moment then came free of the blade leaving it 
as clean as ever. She raised the blade high over her head and slashed 
the man across the face cutting a chunk of his flesh off and causing a 
crack to form in his mask. He fell to the ground writhing in pain, 
clenching his face and screaming. Natalie quickly grabbed Kima&#39;s hand 
and helped her to her feet and they both dashed out of the alley towards 
the apartments. 

******

Kim and the others arrived at the fifth floor of the building and came 
to a stop in front of Kim&#39;s old apartment. She stared at the door 
uncertain about opening it in fear of what might linger within its 
confines. 

&quot;Kim?&quot; Jenn set a hand upon her friend&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You don&#39;t have to 
open it.&quot; She reassured the girl. 

Kim shook her head in disagreement, &quot;No... Kima is right... I have to 
face this.&quot; She took a deep breath and set her hand on the doorknob. 

Jenn set her hand upon Kim&#39;s, &quot;Then we&#39;ll do it together.&quot; She smiled at 
the red head.   

&quot;Guys, Nat and Kima are here!&quot; Jessica called out from her lookout at 
the edge of the balcony hall, &quot;It looks like they have company.&quot; 

Kim nodded at Jenn and they both turned the knob and opened the door. 
The apartment was dark and a smell of death assaulted the girls causing 
them to quickly cover their mouths. The first thing Kim noticed was the 
silverware scattered across the floor and fear welled up on the girl as 
she froze in place. She suddenly wanted to run, wanted to hide. 
Anything, but enter that apartment again. Jenn stepped around her friend 
and entered the kitchen. She stepped around the clutter and took a look 
around then gestured for Kim to follow. Kim simply stayed rooted on to 
her spot. Jenn returned to her friend and took her by the hand, &quot;Come 
on.&quot; She coxed, but Kim would not budge. 

&quot;Girls, you had better hurry.&quot; Jessica stated with a tone of worry in 
her voice. 

&quot;Hide!&quot; Jenn commanded to the others. The girls did as they were told 
and ran back to the stairs, up one more level. 

Tanya stopped before following the others and turned to Jenn, &quot;You be 
careful.&quot; She demanded. 

&quot;We will.&quot; Jenn assured, &quot;Now get going.&quot; Tanya hesitated for a moment 
then rushed up the stairs. Soon after Natalie followed Tanya and Kima 
appeared on the floor running towards the apartment. 

&quot;What are you two doing?&quot; Kima asked anxiously, &quot;Get in there.&quot; She took 
Kim&#39;s other hand and pulled her into the apartment, closing the door 
just as Akaime came stumbling up the stairs. Kima fumbled with the locks 
and just as she flipped the bolt they heard Akaime start banging on the 
door. Kima shakily latched the chain in place and spun around, &quot;Quickly! 
Our bed room.&quot; 

Kim was still frozen in place and shaking her head, &quot;No no no... I don&#39;t 
want to be here.&quot; She protested.

Kima grabbed the girl by the arm, &quot;We have to. Just remember this is 
only a dream.&quot; She reassured the girl.

&quot;But it isn&#39;t a dream.&quot; Kim countered still shaking her head. 

&quot;It is if you want it to be.&quot; Kima stated boldly, &quot;You can&#39;t keep being 
afraid for your entire life.&quot; 

Kim glanced towards the living room, &quot;But...&quot; Images of her dead parents 
entered her mind, the blood soaking in the carpet and their dead eyes. 

&quot;You have too.&quot; Kima commanded, &quot;For Jenn&#39;s sake.&quot; 

Kim glanced at Jenn who had the same level of fear in her eyes, then 
back to the door that was bulging at it&#39;s hinges, &quot;O...okay...&quot; She took 
a deep breath and entered the living room. It was just as she feared. 
There lay her mother, a pool of blood under her head and there was her 
father with the knife still sticking out of his back. She began to shake 
her head and turned to leave the sight when Kima stopped her. 

&quot;Just look straight ahead.&quot; Kima ordered, &quot;And DON&#39;T look down.&quot; She 
commanded, and then turned to Jenn, &quot;That goes for you too.&quot;

The group of girls quickly crossed the living room, stepping over Kim&#39;s 
father and ran to the end of the long hall to the bedrooms. Kima opened 
the door to their parent&#39;s room, &quot;Jenn you hide under the bed.&quot; She 
ordered not leaving room for arguments.

&quot;But...&quot; Jenn began to protest when there was a large crash as Akaime 
broke the front door down. 

&quot;There is no time!&quot; Kima shoved the girl into the room and closed the 
door. She then turned to her double, &quot;You know what needs to be done.&quot; 

Tears were streaming down Kim&#39;s cheeks and she trembled in fear, &quot;I&#39;m 
afraid.&quot; She sobbed while looking at her bedroom door. 

Kima held Kim&#39;s cheeks in her hands and gazed into her eyes, &quot;So am I... 
so am I... but we have to open that door.&quot; 

Kim shook her head, &quot;I...&quot; She had an idea what was behind that door and 
it scared her more then anything else in this nightmarish world. She 
wanted nothing more then to hide under the bed with Jenn and forget all 
this ever happened. 

&quot;There you are!&quot; Akaime snarled, holding his side while staggering down 
the hall. He stopped and blinked at the twins for a moment, &quot;So there 
are two of you. No matter. I&#39;ll take you both.&quot; Used the wall to support 
himself he stumbled down the hall, dragging his wounded leg behind him. 

Kima placed Kim&#39;s hand on the bedroom doorknob and waited until Akaime 
got a little closer, &quot;Wait for it...&quot; She whispered.

Kim let go of the doorknob, &quot;No...&quot; She retreated from the door. 

&quot;NOW!!!&quot; Kima commanded, grabbing the girl&#39;s hand and forcing her to 
take the knob as they both turned it. The door was instantly sucked open 
and there was a black mass writhing upon the ceiling. Lines of jagged 
teeth could be seen twitching in hunger along the edge of the ceiling. 
It&#39;s tentacle like tongue with a forked tip dropped from the centre of 
the mouth and whipped around in the middle of the room and dripping 
saliva upon the carpet, then it noticed the girls and struck out at 
them. Kima glanced from the creature to Akaime, and then suddenly pulled 
Kim to the floor. The tongue speared Akaime through the arm just as he 
reached the girls. He screamed and pulled at the tentacle, trying to 
free his arm from the creature. For the first time he gazed into the 
room and was startled by what he saw. Two more tongues appeared from the 
darkness and shot out at the man, one piecing his shoulder and the other 
wrapping around his neck. The creature pulled Akaime into the room. He 
grabbed the frame of the door, but felt his grip slipping and could not 
hold on for very long. The moment the man was pulled entirely into the 
room the door slammed shut and the apartment became silent once again. 
The two girls lay on the ground panting. Kima finally found the strength 
to open her eyes and was relieved to find that there were alone again. 

&quot;Is it gone?&quot; Kim mumbled into Kima&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;They are gone.&quot; Kima said with a sigh of relief. 

Kima sat up and glanced around. Her eyes fell on the door and she shrunk 
away from it. She could still sense that dark mass, feel it&#39;s saliva 
dripping upon her and the sensation made her shiver in disgust. She then 
turned to her parent&#146;s room, &quot;Jenn?&quot; She quickly opened to door and 
found Jenn peering out from under the bed. Kima leaned against the 
doorframe and let out a long sigh.

&quot;Is it safe?&quot; Jenn asked from her hiding spot. 

&quot;He&#146;s gone.&quot; Kima replied entering the room, &quot;and I don&#39;t think he will 
be bothering any of us ever again.&quot; 

Jenn crawled out from under the bed, &quot;What did you do to him?&quot; She asked 
curiously and at the same time not sure she really wanted to know. 

Kima helped the girl to her feet, &quot;He was eaten by one of our 
nightmares. I figured it would be there and thankfully it was satisfied 
with just taking him and not us.&quot; 

&quot;Is it still there?&quot; Jenn asked nervously. 

Kima shrugged, &quot;Hard to say.&quot;

Jenn smiled at Kim who was still standing at the door. Kim pushed off 
the doorframe and glanced down the hall, her expression changed and she 
let out a scream of terror, &quot;Kim?&quot; Kima turned to see Jenn&#39;s corpse like 
mother grab Kim from behind and wrap its arms around the girl. 

&quot;Mother...&quot; Jenn stumbled backwards until her leg bumped into the bed, 
&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Jeeenniffer...&quot; The creature hissed, &quot;You dishonoured me. You failed 
me... you KILLED me!!!&quot; It snarled gripping Kim by the hair while 
glaring with one good eye at Jenn. 

Kima ran at the creature, &quot;Leave her alone!&quot; She demanded only to be 
instantly knocked to the ground and rolled into a dresser. 

&quot;Mommy stop it...&quot; Jenn was shaking with terror as her mother stepped 
into the room, partly carrying Kim, &quot;Please...&quot; Jenn weakly pleaded. 

&quot;First, I shall kill your little girlfriend...&quot; The corpse said with a 
grin, &quot;Then you will join me as well.&quot; It gripped the bony fingers of 
one hand around Kim&#39;s tiny neck and began to squeeze the life out of the 
girl. Kim struggled against the creatures grip only to find her strength 
slowly draining from her body. 

&quot;jeennn...&quot; Kim tried to speak as she gasped for air only to feel the 
corpse&#39;s finger close tighter on her larynx, her eyes began to blur and 
she felt faint. 

&quot;MOTHER STOP IT!!!&quot; Jenn screamed at the creature, &quot;Leave her alone. Why 
can&#39;t you just leave us alone?!?&quot; She cried in frustration as she 
watched the life of the first girl she ever loved slip away, &quot;I love 
her...&quot; she whispered. 

Almost as if knives were driven into Jenn&#39;s mother she released Kim, 
letting the girl tumble to the ground, and staggered backwards, &quot;You 
can...&quot; The creature stammered, &quot;You can only love me.&quot; The dead woman 
was becoming frantic as she watched her daughter rush over to Kim and 
wrap her arms around the red head, &quot;You can&#39;t...&quot; The corpse muttered 
again. 

&quot;I do!&quot; Jenn cried, glaring up at her mother, &quot;I always have... You 
never listened to me... always told me how to feel... Well I&#39;m not your 
child, anymore.&quot; She felt strength build inside of her heart as she 
spoke the words. 

The woman stumbled back out of the room in dismay, &quot;but... you are my 
daughter... I love you... I know what is right...&quot; It continued to 
ramble. 

&quot;Not anymore.&quot; Jenn&#39;s glare intensified with her new found courage, &quot;You 
are dead!&quot; She declared, &quot;Dead, Dead, Dead!!!&quot; She screamed at the 
woman. 

Flames wrapped around Jenn&#39;s mother&#39;s legs and crawled up her body. For 
the first time the woman looked down at her hands and saw the corpse she 
had become. She gazed at her daughter and saw the hatred burning in the 
girl&#39;s eyes. She bowed her head as the flames enveloped her, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry...&quot; she whispered then the flames consumed her entirely and she 
dissolved into a pile of ashes that blew away in a passing wind.  

Jenn watched the last of the ashes drift away as tears washed out her 
vision, &quot;Goodbye... Mom...&quot; She hugged Kim and let out a tired sob. 

*******

Gwen glided down to the apartment balcony as Kim, Kima and Jenn exited 
the apartment. Kris ran over to her friends and hugged Jenn tightly. 
When she looked into the girl&#39;s eyes there was something different about 
her, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; She asked concerned. 

Jenn gave the girl a weak smile, &quot;I&#39;ll live... I finally said my 
goodbyes.&quot; She glanced back at the apartment then back to Kim, &quot;Can we 
go back to the academy now?&quot;

Kris nodded, &quot;If you wish.&quot; She glanced around to see all the other 
girl&#39;s had gathered together. Everyone was hugging each other and 
listening to the tales of how they defeated their nightmares. She then 
turned to her sister, &quot;Gwen?&quot;

Gwen nodded, &quot;Alright everyone. Time to go home.&quot; She walked down the 
hall to another apartment door, touched the door for a moment and when 
she opened it. Beyond the door they could all see the path that lead 
them into the forest and the exit back to the academy. The girls rushed 
down the path and out of the forest, each one grateful to be free of 
that evil place. 

Kris stopped before leaving the forest to turn and see her sister 
walking in the opposite direction. She ran towards the girl and wrapped 
her arms around Gwen&#39;s waist in a warm hug, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Kris muttered 
into the girl&#39;s back then ran off before getting an answer. The moment 
she stepped out of the forest the entrance closed up behind her and she 
saw her sister wave at her before being surrounded by the trees. Kris 
gazed up at the sun and smiled. She finally felt like she might have a 
chance at life after all. She heard some of the girls calling out for 
her and chased after them. Ready to begin her new life with her friend 
and new family.
