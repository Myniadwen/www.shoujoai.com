Tweet!

Twelve young women lined up for brief inspection and roll call. With a 
whistle in her mouth, Leena K. crossed her arms and looked up and down 
the line.

&quot;We&#39;re going over the basics today,&quot; she told them. &quot;A general 
Olympic-style exercise for everyone. That includes relays, ropes, bars, 
and basketball for today. I wish to God that we had our own pool, but we 
can do without it. Now I know that some of you feel that you can&#39;t 
participate in these exercises, and to that I say you should drop that 
idea. There&#39;s only one student in this whole class who has trouble with 
participation, but she and I have made arrangements to fit her needs.&quot; 
Katt Parkin blushed and looked away, and knew that a few of the girls 
stared right at her. Even the best of them hated a teacher&#39;s pet.

&quot;After we do our stretches,&quot; resumed the teacher, &quot;we&#39;ll start with a 
few relay races. We&#39;ll work our way through the ropes, then we&#39;ll hit 
the bars and maybe have a basketball game if there&#39;s any time left. 
Katt, I&#39;ve arranged for a short distance for you; you should be able to 
cover it.&quot; Parkin blushed again and wished everyone would not stare at 
her so much. The twelve girls were broken into three teams of four and 
were split up with one standing at each corner of the gym (except for 
Katt, who was closer between two good runners). Once Leena blew her 
whistle, each of the groups made a run for it. Since one group went at a 
time, it wasn&#39;t so much a race as it was a time trial.

The relay left many breathless, but it hadn&#39;t been grueling. Leena let 
her students rest for awhile as she explained the next exercise, the 
ropes. Besides the obvious vertical climb, there were also rings and an 
overhead climb that hung above a safety mat. Most of the girls looked 
forward to this (sans rope burn), but Gabrielle turned green&#151;and not the 
kind she was accustomed to.

&quot;Aw, shyte,&quot; she whispered under her breath. &quot;Ropes! God in heaven, I 
knew there&#39;d be ropes! I knew it! That&#39;s it; I&#39;m gonna fail gym. I&#39;ll be 
a lark at parties, sure!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with ropes?&quot; asked Ayanna, who had not yet been her 
girlfriend long enough to find out anything secret. Gabrielle groused.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid o&#39; heights. Last time I was more&#39;n a head above ground was 
when I was a wee girl in Disneyland. Got stuck in a ride high off the 
ground and I bawled like a sissy. They couldn&#39;t never get me back up 
there again, not for a song or anything.&quot;

&quot;Oh... poor baby.&quot; Ayanna rubbed O&#39;Shannon&#39;s back in sympathy, trying to 
soothe the nerve-wracked girl as best she could. Since Gabrielle&#39;s name 
fell around the middle of the alphabet, she had quite a bit to dread: 
the suspense kept building up. Leena and some of the other students were 
preoccupied with the climbers, however.

&quot;Great! Now don&#39;t slide back down, use your hands.&quot; The climber, the 
bubbly Ana Lu, whooped in excitement and shimmied back down the rope 
until she was jumping distance away from the safety mat. She let out 
another victorious howl upon touchdown and rubbed her weary arms and 
burnt palms. Gabrielle shuddered as her name came one step closer to 
being called.

&quot;Joss?&quot; Jocelyn McKeough screamed bloody murder and nearly jumped half 
the distance of the rope as she attacked the challenge with all her 
might. Ayanna couldn&#39;t help but be impressed as she split her attention.

&quot;Look, just go a few feet and stop. How high can you go before you feel 
sick?&quot;

&quot;Bout&#39; the second story of a house,&quot; said the redhead. &quot;I can climb 
stairs and take an elevator fine, and once I badgered meself into goin&#39; 
up a third story buildin&#39;, but in those cases, I usually feel like I&#39;m 
still on ground level. I can&#39;t stand it when it don&#39;t look like I got 
nothin&#39; beneath me.&quot; Ayanna smiled very gently and kissed her cheek.

&quot;You&#39;ll do fine.&quot;

&quot;Aya?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m up,&quot; she whispered, and Montgomery left her girlfriend&#39;s side. 
Gabrielle took in a deep breath and watched nervously as her brave 
girlfriend ascended upwards like an angel, then came back down. She had 
made it look so easy. Gabrielle knew she would have terrible butterflies 
long before she even touched the dreaded cord. Leena&#39;s next word sealed 
the deal:

&quot;Gab?&quot;

&quot;Aw, hell.&quot; The poor girl swallowed and managed to walk towards the 
rope. She could touch it and hop up a few feet, but anything higher than 
a meter without solid support and... She shivered and tried to focus. 
Even Blake had managed to get all the way to the top, and she had 
depleted her meds for the week. Gabrielle could do the bars and she 
liked basketball, but those ropes... those damned ropes... it was all 
she could do to stop convulsing as she held the cord and shakily looked 
up.

Crap, she thought to herself, that was damn stupid of me! Ayanna 
screamed out her support, and soon Janine and Blake were with her. 
Aintzane, who was studying Gabrielle for her homework in Madsen&#39;s class, 
voiced her support as well, and even Leena seemed to wish her well. 
Gabrielle pursed her lips and eyes, and managed to climb a few inches 
up. Her hands began to sweat with fury, and her legs wobbled as they 
lost touch with the ground. Her elbows shivered and a squeal of terror 
came from her throat. The poor thing was barely a few feet off the 
ground when she quit.

&quot;I know you can go all the way, Gab,&quot; said Leena. O&#39;Shannon shook her 
head fiercely. &quot;Look, I know you can do it. I&#39;ve seen you do tougher 
things.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t! I&#39;m afraid of heights! Anymore and I&#39;ll faint!&quot; Leena sighed, 
feeling just a little frustrated.

&quot;Gabrielle, you won&#39;t fall. You&#39;ve got four friends down here watching 
you and supporting you, and I&#39;ll catch you if you do fall. Just trust us 
and go on. I know you can do it.&quot; Again, she shook her head violently.

&quot;I can&#39;t! I can&#39;t even hold on! ...Ow! Shyte!&quot; Cursing loudly, Gabrielle 
nearly screamed out loud as her hands slipped and burned from the rope 
friction. She finally let go and flopped on the ground, landing with a 
painless bump on the mat. She groaned in humiliation and tried hiding 
her red face.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she said, over and over again. Leena sighed 
in defeat.

&quot;So am I. I can&#39;t give you a good grade for quitting.&quot;

&quot;But at least I tried!&quot; shouted O&#39;Shannon defensively. &quot;That should 
count for something! It was dam&#39; brave of me just to touch that thing!&quot; 
Leena grumbled, but it was only by the word of Blake and Janine, who 
insisted their friend&#39;s phobia was true, that she got any kind of grade 
at all. Embarrassed and beaten, Gabrielle picked herself up and limped 
back to Ayanna, who embraced her with a quiet hug.

&quot;Hi, hon. How does a date sound?&quot; she whispered. Gabrielle managed to 
smile.

&quot;Swell. Thanks.&quot;

&quot;No problem. You know, I think you did something really brave.&quot;

&quot;...Y-yeah, right.&quot;

............

Leena smiled and waved away her students as the last bell sounded. Some 
had not bothered to shower, while others would remain for soccer 
practice or other after-school activities. She saw Gabrielle and Ayanna 
walking off together, chatting; Furious Hail seemed very distant from 
Ivory, who had been cavorting more and more with Ancelin recently. Their 
politics were none of her business; she only watched them and hoped that 
they would make good decisions. She did not expect Kathlyn to stay after 
class, because she had noticed her leaving eagerly for several days. 
Curiosity was drawn out.

&quot;Is something the matter, Katt?&quot; she asked, using the girl&#39;s informal 
name. Parkin shrugged meekly.

&quot;Uh, no... I&#39;m kinda just waiting for a friend.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well, I just asked because you usually seem ready to leave, like 
you don&#39;t like me or something.&quot; Parkin managed a weak laugh as she 
dismissed her teacher&#39;s prying voice.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s nothing like that! I just... well, I like getting home before 
my brother does.&quot;

&quot;Matt, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. He&#39;s staying over at a friend&#39;s house today.&quot;

&quot;So you can take your time getting home?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Katt fumbled for words for awhile, then murmured with a meek 
smile, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to a friend&#39;s house as well. Um, my parents 
understand.&quot; Leena shrugged again.

&quot;Anyone I know?&quot;

&quot;Oh, um... I don&#39;t think so. Her name&#39;s... Danica. I&#39;ve got a car, so 
I&#39;m just waiting for her.&quot; Leena nodded again and was silent. Kathlyn 
fidgeted nervously. Did her teacher realize that there was no Danica, or 
was she just content to hear those jittery lies? She just seemed 
unaware, maybe

&quot;You&#39;re antsy!&quot; she stated at last. &quot;Sit down. Take a few breaths. You 
look more nervous than Gab did before she climbed the ropes. Go on, go 
get a drink at the fountain.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; lied Parkin shakily. Leena frowned.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think so. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I know when to stay out of my 
students&#39; affairs, but... well, the things I&#39;ve observed... Uhhh, Katt, 
this may seem uncomfortable...&quot; Knowing where the older blonde was 
going, Kathlyn squirmed and tried to change the subject.

&quot;Uh, yeah... Say, um, I&#39;ve been making some friends in soccer. I mean, I 
never thought I&#39;d be good at any sport&#151;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve seen you come to class with bruises.&quot; Katt was silent, Leena too. 
The girl&#39;s face was red. She took a breath and laughed.

&quot;Well, I am the team goalie.&quot;

&quot;Those aren&#39;t soccer bruises.&quot; Katt&#39;s chest throbbed with every beat of 
her heart.

&quot;I just bump into things, especially at my job. I work where I bump into 
stuff a lot. It doesn&#39;t hurt, it&#39;s just inconvenient.&quot;

&quot;Katt, I like you and respect you, and I always hope my students treat 
me the same.&quot; Leena put one impatient hand on her hip and looked at the 
younger woman very seriously. &quot;I&#39;m not na&iuml;ve,&quot; she continued, &quot;so don&#39;t 
treat me like it, and please respect my intelligence. I can tell what&#39;s 
going on. Listen, Katt&#151;&quot;

&quot;Leena, it&#39;s&#151;&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not in trouble,&quot; she resumed, coming closer to her student. &quot;I 
just want you to be frank with me. Is your brother hitting you?&quot;

&quot;Matt? No, God no!&quot;

&quot;Any of your other brothers? I know how tough it is being a girl in a 
houseful of boys&#151;&quot;

&quot;No, most are moved out or else they leave me alone,&quot; she whispered. 
Leena stepped very close, touched Katt&#39;s shoulder, and rubbed it gently. 
Parkin had to admit to herself that the nurturing touch felt quite good.

&quot;Is it your father?&quot; Mute. &quot;You can tell me, Katt. Look, I know that 
you&#39;re being hit, and it&#39;s by something with hands. I&#39;m not going to 
accuse anybody, but if one of my students is being hurt, I&#39;m going to 
intervene and help. It&#39;s my job.&quot; Taciturn. &quot;Katt, please trust me.&quot; She 
squeezed her eyes shut, but didn&#39;t cry.

&quot;Not all the time.&quot;

&quot;You believe he might today?&quot; She shook her head.

&quot;I can never tell. Sometimes... but yesterday he seemed really upset 
because of what mom was doing.&quot;

&quot;What does she do?&quot;

&quot;Just work,&quot; sighed Katt, who had given into Leena&#39;s comfortable touch. 
&quot;Work, work, work: two jobs she and all of us hate. Most of my family 
works and we&#39;re still in debt. How about that?&quot; She chuckled a little 
and gently removed Leena&#39;s hand from her shoulder. &quot;Look, I&#39;ll level 
with you. I don&#39;t have any friends. Whenever I think my father... is in 
a bad mood... I just find some homeless shelter to go to, or I go to 
work and stay there until it&#39;s time for school. It&#39;s not bad, and like I 
said, it doesn&#39;t happen all the time.&quot; Leena sighed. She had heard of 
girls like Katt before, even in Finland, but being raised in a loving 
home brought her away from actually meeting one.

&quot;But Katt,&quot; she whispered gently, touching both her shoulders now, &quot;just 
once is too many times. You don&#39;t have to put up with it.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; she sighed, still not showing any signs of tears. &quot;That&#39;s why 
I tell Matt to stay at a friend&#39;s, and I go somewhere else. I just run 
and hide until the storm&#39;s over, or if I have to, I just lock myself in 
my room.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re not disturbed?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got good locks,&quot; she muttered with a grim smile. Leena drew in a 
very deep breath, looking up at the ceiling as if to consult the very 
Powers themselves.

&quot;Katt,&quot; she said at length, &quot;I don&#39;t know what I can do for you, but if 
you don&#39;t think it would be too weird, you can stay in my apartment if 
you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Katt&#39;s face practically beamed at the invite, and her mood 
swung back to the happiness it sometimes showed at strange intervals. 
Leena nodded.

&quot;I&#39;ve got a nice couch, and while I can&#39;t promise anything big, or a 
fancy breakfast, at least you won&#39;t be in a shelter or... wherever you 
work. And you&#39;ll be early to classes.&quot; Kathlyn chuckled lightly, and 
since it did seem like the best option&#151;and she was starting to like 
Leena as more than a teacher&#151;she agreed. Leena smiled, as she was easily 
inclined to do, and led the younger girl to her car. When they arrived 
at the humble yet pleasant apartment complex and walked into the 
first-story door, Kathlyn Parkin realized that she had a crush on her 
own teacher.

............

Rather than going directly home, Lilian rode her bike to the park, 
carrying an umbrella and a large white beach towel. She liked the 
outdoors but was unfortunately restricted due to her condition; the sun 
usually started to burn her before an hour had passed. It was cool and 
cloudy that day, with barely any rays poking out of the puffy canopy, so 
Lilian would take the shaded chance and enjoy the weather before it 
turned cold. She brought her parasol just in case; the towel was so she 
could lie down without getting earth-stains.

Living around a suburban-rural community didn&#39;t give her much of an 
opportunity to enjoy more than a few acres, and what was there really 
wasn&#39;t very enjoyable. The roads were paved, not worn by feet, and there 
was a shopping center not a mile away. The air wasn&#39;t always clear, and 
there was enough trash on the ground for it to count as a compost heap. 
Whatever was left of the creek was dirty and polluted, and cars traveled 
around and even on the grass. Lilian sighed. Some Americans could be so 
insensitive.

In the mess and mangle of the park, Lilian found a pine tree she liked 
to shirk under and spread her towel out beneath it. She sat down and 
took a few breaths to enjoy the day. A car passed by, filling the air 
with smoke. Lilian coughed and cursed such foolish behavior. In the 
distance, people her age were playing frisbee golf, unaffected by the 
defecation around them. She ached to join them but feared rejection; she 
was socially inept and didn&#39;t exactly look like a normal teenager. 
Sighing again, Lilian tried not to contemplate the ugly fate given to 
her and managed to enjoy some part of the day. It would be winter before 
she knew it, and probably a long one at that.

The cloudy shadows above didn&#39;t fade, and the rays of sun that poked out 
here and there became slimmer. The afternoon was waning and evening 
would soon approach; forecasters had seen rain for that night. Lilian 
didn&#39;t want to go back home unless it seriously started to pour, or else 
if the dark hours started to creep up. She distanced herself from home 
whenever possible, and some days she never returned at all. The pale 
young woman would&#39;ve been more encouraged to do otherwise if Mother and 
Father Nachtheim concerned themselves over their daughter&#39;s absence, 
but...

A shadow unlike one cast by clouds covered her. With such shade over her 
eyes, she could open them wide to see who was there. She smiled warmly 
as the person squatted down and joined her on the towel. It was Hitomi 
Madsen, out for a stroll.

&quot;Guten tag, frau Nachtheim,&quot; she said. Lilian&#39;s smile broadened. Her 
teacher knew a handful of German words and used them whenever she could 
if she was around Lilian. It made the young woman feel more relaxed and 
at home, even if the accent was funny or the pronunciation was off.

&quot;Hello, Miss Madsen,&quot; she replied back, making sure to do just the 
opposite. Hitomi grinned and sat next to her.

&quot;You don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot; Lilian shook her head; her teacher let out a 
long gust of wind as she relaxed her body. She quietly pulled a 
half-empty pack of cigarettes and a matchbook from her jacket and put 
one in her mouth.

&quot;You smoke?&quot; Lilain shook her head and Hitomi lit up. She drew in the 
tobacco and blew it out very slowly. &quot;I try limiting myself to three 
smokes a day&#151;morning, noon, and night. This is my last one. I used to be 
a chain smoker, but a friend helped me quit that. My ultimate goal is to 
get off completely, but... old habits.&quot; Lilian nodded, understanding 
what she meant.

&quot;Not easy to quit.&quot;

&quot;No, God no,&quot; murmured Madsen, inhaling again. &quot;It&#39;s addictive as hell. 
I nearly had a nervous breakdown going from six to three; I can&#39;t 
imagine what one or none must feel like.&quot; Lilian was apparently content 
to just listen to her teacher speak; she never talked very much, even if 
her few friends were around. She had blushed a fraction when her teacher 
let a tiny word of foul language slip, but otherwise didn&#39;t mind. Hitomi 
noticed the reaction and grinned.

&quot;Oh... I tend to let bad words slip out now and then, but I&#39;m very good 
at keeping it out of the way of business. You could say it&#39;s another 
&#145;bad pleasure-habit&#39; of mine, like smoking. It&#39;s something I need to 
quit, but I just can&#39;t. I know I sound hypocritical... but I&#39;m not 
perfect.&quot; Lilian smiled. So, the woman she liked and respected was 
really not very different from anyone else&#151;and here, certainly, she 
didn&#39;t have that commanding presence. Madsen seemed content to let her 
hair down (figuratively; she wore it down in class) and relax, even if 
it meant exposing her weak points.

&quot;I still respect you, frau Madsen,&quot; assured Lilian.

&quot;You can call me Hitomi, Lilian. We&#39;re not in class.&quot;

&quot;But is it not disrespectful for youths to address their elders like 
that? Or their teachers?&quot;

&quot;Mm, perhaps,&quot; she shrugged, &quot;but we&#39;re not in a formal setting. Would 
you think it weird to speak to me so casually?&quot;

&quot;A bit, ma&#39;am&#151;erm, uh, or should I say, Hitomi?&quot; The Japanese name 
sounded cute, and even more so coming through with a Teutonic accent. 
Hitomi laughed gently and flicked at her cigarette.

&quot;Whatever makes you comfortable, Lilian. I can call you Lilian, or would 
you prefer Miss Nachtheim?&quot; The albino smiled humbly. Aside from a 
handful of people, nobody had ever really been that friendly with her. 
Even her parents rarely called her by name, instead choosing &quot;young 
lady&quot; or &quot;daughter&quot;.

&quot;I would actually like to be called Lil,&quot; she whispered. Hitomi 
chuckled.

&quot;Then Lil, do you come here very often?&quot;

&quot;Ja, all the time, whenever I can. I really do not like going home.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; She frowned and pulled her knees to her chest, hugging 
herself loosely.

&quot;My parents... I am sure they do not like me. My absence is not really 
even recognized. I can apparently come and go as I please, unless there 
is some stupid event that I am forced to come to.&quot;

&quot;Event?&quot; Lilian casually told her teacher of her family lineage and 
status, and how she was often expected to attend many fancy socials, 
events, galas, concerts, and parties. She hated some of it, tolerated 
most, and only really liked going to musical or theatrical events, if 
and when. Hitomi Madsen seemed genuinely impressed.

&quot;Amazing. I never knew.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good. I&#39;m afraid that people will treat me differently if they 
learn I&#39;m famous or rich. I&#39;m sometimes tempted to just tell them, if 
only for the attention, but I know it will all be false. This way is 
better.&quot; She loosened her legs and laid flat on the blanket, squinting 
against the milky sky. She stayed there in silence; Madsen didn&#39;t feel 
inclined to speak at all. At length she began to brush Lilian&#39;s long 
grayish-white locks with her fingers, giving some measure of comfort to 
the young woman. Lilian smiled and whispered something in her own 
language.

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;I said that felt good.&quot; Madsen smiled and continued brushing the girl&#39;s 
hair, feeling it not unattractive at all. There was no doubt in her mind 
that Lilian was very beautiful, both outward and in, she just looked 
different. Maybe even that difference alone contributed to her 
attractiveness; monotony got ugly after awhile. At length, when the sky 
turned darker and the breeze became chill, Madsen stopped brushing and 
glanced at her watch.

&quot;As good an alternative to smoking this is,&quot; she said, &quot;I must be off 
home. I&#39;ve got lots of work to do, and I&#39;m feeling hungry. Would you be 
uncomfortable if I asked you over to dinner?&quot; Lilian sat up and nearly 
beamed.

&quot;I would love that!&quot; she exclaimed. Hitomi chuckled at her sudden 
eagerness and stood up, helping her student as well.

&quot;All right. Are you sure your parents won&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she snorted, &quot;not in the least. I&#39;ve been away from home before; I 
will do it again. I could stay over and they&#39;d never notice.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if that would be a good idea,&quot; murmured Madsen 
thoughtfully (even though she actually liked the thought quite a bit), 
&quot;but we&#39;ll see. You can at least stay for supper.&quot; Lilian smiled warmly, 
and followed her teacher to her car, detouring only once to pick up her 
bike.

............

Lilian had always envisioned her teacher&#39;s house to be small, if not 
humble, perhaps built to suit only her needs and maybe a luxury once in 
awhile. She wasn&#39;t far off the mark. The fact that she didn&#39;t live in an 
apartment was a surprise, because she could&#39;ve managed to squeeze all 
her possessions into a smaller place. She reasoned that Hitomi liked the 
extra room; being crammed in somewhere tight was never very fun.

&quot;What do you like to eat?&quot; she asked as she and Lilian came through the 
door. Hitomi dropped her keys and mail on a cupboard and removed her 
shoes roughly, putting them on a small rack nearby. Lilian did the same. 
Madsen&#39;s small home was dimly-lit and didn&#39;t have a particularly great 
smell; it wasn&#39;t well-organized or clean, and not very colorful. This 
was where Lilian&#39;s imagination and reality parted ways&#151;she had thought 
the opposite.

&quot;I&#39;m in the mood for casserole,&quot; she said. There came a pause from her 
teacher.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to warn you, I&#39;m not fond of cooking and I can&#39;t do much 
outside the basics. Unless you&#39;re willing, I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to 
settle for something less.&quot; Lilian smiled and made her way into the 
kitchen. Being mostly independent led her to making meals for herself, 
and since she preferred reading to television, she had spent many long 
hours learning unique recipes for various meals that would otherwise 
have been simple. She volunteered for the act and set to work; Hitomi 
thanked her and turned on the TV.

Lilian ignored the half-hour sitcom and fixed a crude casserole with the 
leftover ground beef, cheese, and bread crumbs she found. She could 
improvise when needed, and her teacher seemed to have more at hand than 
she gave herself credit for. By the time the end credits had rolled out 
from under the show&#39;s carpet, Madsen was completely relaxed from the 
stresses of the day and dinner was ready.

&quot;Oh, it looks good!&quot; she exclaimed as she saw the spread on her humble 
table: Lilian had taken plates, utensils, and glasses and set them to 
good use, splitting them two ways for her and her teacher to share. She 
had manners enough not to serve herself until Hitomi took a piece (even 
though she was not the hostess), and Hitmi had manners enough to leave 
the television off. She quickly reached into her refrigerator and pulled 
out a green bottle.

&quot;Wine?&quot;

&quot;Just a bit,&quot; replied Lilian. She added with a smirk, &quot;After all, I am 
underage in this country.&quot;

&quot;Did you drink in Germany?&quot;

&quot;Only during social occasions, when my parents permitted it. I will if 
you&#39;re offering; I&#39;d just prefer something else.&quot;

&quot;A little wine&#39;ll do us both good,&quot; said Madsen quietly as she poured 
two glasses. She sat down and clinked her glass with Lilian&#39;s, and drank 
slowly. Lilian barely sipped hers, vying for a humble glass of water 
when she felt thirsty.

The meal tasted as good as it had looked; Hitomi insisted on cleaning 
the dishes and asked Lilian to relax. It was not often that people 
treated the young albino so kindly, so &quot;normally&quot;, so her guard was up a 
little bit in spite of how eagerly she embraced the safety and rest of 
the small loveseat. Being a bit unaccustomed to such freedom and 
goodwill, she was a bit shy about changing the silent mood. Luckily, it 
seemed both their minds were on the same tangent.

&quot;What sort of music do you like?&quot; asked Hitomi from the kitchen.

&quot;Instrumental. I really like Wagner&#39;s works.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So I played the right thing on the first day of school.&quot;

&quot;Ja.&quot; Madsen chuckled very softly, and left the dishes in the washer 
while she joined her student on the loveseat. &quot;I suspected as much,&quot; she 
sighed, &quot;but it was also meant to be a general... feeling or term, or 
whatever. Music helps us dream, I think, so... it worked.&quot;

&quot;Do you have any others?&quot; It didn&#39;t take her long to figure out what 
Lilian meant.

&quot;No, just that one. It&#39;s got quite a compilation, and I&#39;m afraid to buy 
any others since they seem to carry everything else I have. Would you 
like to listen?&quot; Lilian nodded her head. Hitomi got up (reluctantly), 
drew the CD out, put it in, and played it.

Lilian recognized the music playing as something from &quot;Lohengrin&quot;.

Then, &quot;The Valkyrie&quot;.

After that, &quot;Tristan and Isolde&quot;. It really was quite a mix.

Lilian closed her eyes and kept them closed, letting the music take her 
to places only dreams allowed. If Heaven were anything like this 
experience, she was ready and willing; it was better than cozying up by 
a fire with a mug of cocoa (although she certainly wouldn&#39;t have been 
against that). Hitomi seemed absorbed in the music and stared absently 
at the wall, just as lost as her student was. She didn&#39;t notice young 
Lilian edging closer to her, until their bodies were in contact and her 
head was resting on her shoulder. Hitomi smiled warmly, and even though 
she knew she would regret it in the future, she put her arm around her 
student. Lilian sighed in contentment.

The music came to an end after a long while, and neither had moved. 
Eventually, Hitomi drew in a deep breath and let it out. The last hour 
had been more intimate and personal than my nights and evenings with her 
previous lovers; it was something so simple that to cherish it was a 
prerequisite. Lilian had never looked happier&#151;she had never been 
happier. She still looked to be in a euphoric state; Hitomi didn&#39;t want 
to break it. But the hour was late. She shook her student gently.

&quot;Lilian...&quot;

&quot;Hitomi,&quot; whispered the girl very gently, &quot;may I please stay the night?&quot; 
A stab of love and terror, wickedly cold and beautifully warm at once, 
pierced Madsen&#39;s spirit. She desperately wanted to say yes, for truth be 
told, she had fallen for Lilian ever since taking that very first peek 
into her soul. She badly wanted the girl to stay over&#151;that night and 
every night, safe in her arms and happy&#151;but the businesswoman in her 
knew that it could not be. She was still her teacher, and probably at 
least ten years older. She swallowed and tried fighting off her 
weakness.

&quot;Lilian, you can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Please? I do not want to go back home.&quot;

&quot;But you have to.&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t care about me,&quot; she sighed, and to emphasize it, she clung 
onto the older woman&#39;s arm for dear hope. The stab grew worse; Hitomi 
felt a lump in her throat. She tried calming her desires by stroking the 
long braid of whitish hair and whispering.

&quot;Lil, you can&#39;t stay here the night. Even if I didn&#39;t mind, and I don&#39;t, 
it wouldn&#39;t be professional. In the morning, I&#39;ll still be your 
teacher.&quot;

&quot;I understand. Just tonight, then?&quot; Hitmi frowned. Lilian sounded 
desperate, as if going back home would kill her&#151;or maybe she only felt 
alive everywhere else. The teacher sniffed and shook her head.

&quot;Just tonight,&quot; she stated, &quot;but...&quot;

And then, there was silence. Lilian&#39;s smile was warm, and her ruby-red 
eyes radiated love. Her heart seemed to shed off its burden, and felt 
light again. The simple gesture apparently garnished more thanks than 
Hitomi thought possible. She had never seen anything so beautiful 
before.

Hitomi Madsen lost the battle with her sensible side and took Lilian&#39;s 
face into her hands, gently kissing her for as long as she dared.

Leena set her alarm to go off at six in the morning and stripped down to 
a white tank top and shorts; Katt settled for a T-shirt and her jeans. 
She had already thanked the older woman enough to embarrass her. The 
light flicked out and Leena was in the bed, covered by only a sheet 
since the weather was still warm. For awhile, there was silence as 
Kathlyn tried to adjust sleeping in the foreign yet comfortable place.

&quot;Katt,&quot; said Leena suddenly, &quot;you don&#39;t snore, do you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so. Do you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Would you tell me if I do?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, same here?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Silence again. It was almost cute, Leena wanting to know if her 
rest would go disturbed or not. Then again, Leena could pass off as 
being a very cute person despite her age and build. She was anything but 
macho or butch, and could probably pass off as a ballet instructor, 
especially with her accent. Katt sighed. She wished she had gone to 
ballet classes, but her family...

I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have to think about it here, she said thankfully. She 
smiled and tried to sleep, but even then she couldn&#39;t. Not a full meter 
away, Leena snoozed lightly, the only sound coming from her nose as it 
took in and expelled air. It sounded like she was still awake and not 
quite able to drift away. Kathlyn fidgeted and waved at her sheets as 
she tried to adjust her comfort, but something still bothered her. She 
sighed, and in spite of herself, went to resolve it.

Leena stirred slightly as she felt her bed shake. She immediately tensed 
as she felt the presence of another in her bed. It was Kathlyn, 
practically sucking on her inhaler. In the darkness, she could only make 
out the younger girl&#39;s general appearance, but she looked distress.

&quot;Yes?&quot; said Leena quietly. Kathlyn&#39;s blush was covered by the darkness.

&quot;May I... um... share your bed?&quot;

&quot;You said I should have it. If you want it, I&#39;ll take the couch.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Katt nudged herself in and cuddled close to Leena, feeling 
herself become oddly more comfortable. If anyone in the whole wide world 
could be a protector to her... &quot;I just need someone to hold me,&quot; she 
whispered. &quot;I&#39;ve never been held all my life.&quot;

Leena&#39;s heart went out to the poor girl, so she automatically drew her 
into an embrace and kept her there. Kathlyn Parkin quickly faded into 
Nippon. She had never slept more soundly or more peacefully since then; 
she knew now that she could be at peace, and could find someone strong 
enough to help her, hold her, and love her. Maybe even all three at 
once.</pre>
