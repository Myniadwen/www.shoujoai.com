The opposite of love is not hate, it&#39;s indifference. The opposite of art 
is not ugliness, it&#39;s indifference. The opposite of faith is not heresy, 
it&#39;s indifference. And the opposite of life is not death, it&#39;s 
indifference.

Prize-

Captain David Rogers reached into his hip pocket and wiped the 
perspiration from his forehead. Armed forces radio played music from a 
small radio in the corner behind the nurse who was quickly wiping down a 
counter top. He heard the spastic coughing again, and frowned in disgust 
as he turned to see the rail thin old woman sitting on the examination 
table shaking all over as she continued her coughing fit.

He could remember originally being stationed as a frontline medic with 
one of the negro regiments in Italy, and how long it had taken to get 
any of his superiors to acknowledge any of the many transfer requests 
he&#39;d sent in to HQ. It wasn&#39;t the frontline he was afraid of, and he 
didn&#39;t consider himself a bigot, but he did question why he&#39;d been sent 
to the frontline with a colored regiment. The coloreds were looked down 
upon and segregated, and so he saw his being sent to them as some sort 
of punishment duty (for what he never could guess). Finally, he was 
reassigned to a MASH unit.

Which was how he ended up in Dachau.

He&#39;d been here since the initial liberation, and had come to resent it. 
Sure, he&#39;d felt as sorry for these poor bastards as everyone else had at 
first, but after a while one skeletal frame blended and faded into 
another until they all had a monotonous sameness to them. And the smell; 
everyone and everything in the camp seemed to exude it. And it followed 
you around like a cartoon storm cloud even after you left camp.

A knock on the door alerted him that a translator had been found. 
Reaching into his pocket he pulled out a flask of whisky, took a quick 
swig, and turned around to see Nurse Sarah with another nameless, 
faceless, grey looking stick with legs.

&quot;Lieutenant Shore is it?&quot; he asked, his voice raised so he could be 
heard over the big band on the radio and the hacking of his patient, 
&quot;Are you ready?&quot;

&quot;Yes doctor,&quot; Sarah answered a bit surprised. &quot;Where&#39;s Captain Stevens?&quot;

&quot;Colonel Wilson sent for him. Something about a statistical analysis,&quot; 
the doctor explained, &quot;I&#39;ve been sent from the men&#39;s camp as a 
replacement.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve replaced Captain Stevens?&quot; Sarah asked. &quot;But I only left to find 
someone who speaks Polish not even ten minutes ago.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to the army,&quot; the other nurse quipped as she continued 
cleaning.

&quot;Oh, I see, yes. Well, this is Gilda Groz...&quot;

&quot;Lieutenant Shore,&quot; Rogers sighed as he put his flask back in his 
pocket, &quot;Let&#39;s get one thing straight, okay? I don&#39;t care what her name 
is. She&#39;ll probably be dead by tomorrow anyways, as will she,&quot; he said, 
motioning with his thumb over to the patient sitting up on the 
examination table. &quot;So let&#39;s cut pretenses and just get on with this.&quot;

Gilda noticed the sudden stiffening of Sarah&#39;s body, as well as the 
angry stare she was giving the doctor. &quot;Anoil,&quot; she asked, &quot;(What&#39;s 
wrong?)&quot;

Sarah wanted to scream at the doctor in front of her, giving the creep a 
piece of her mind. Unfortunately, he was a Captain and she was only a 
2nd Lieutenant. She&#39;d already had a demerit for insubordination once 
after slapping a superior (the fact that he&#39;d pinched her rear somehow 
never came up during the inquest).

&quot;(Nothing,)&quot; Sarah finally responded through clenched teeth. Meeting the 
Captain&#39;s gaze, she took a deep breath. &quot;Very well Doctor, whenever 
you&#39;re ready.&quot;

Gilda turned away from Sarah to study the old woman coughing on the 
examination table. Pushing her glasses up the bridge of her nose with 
her index finger once more, she slowly made her way over to her and 
began talking to the woman in Polish.

&quot;Ask her to tell her we need her name and age, and that we need to weigh 
her and get her height.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Sarah answered crisply. Turning to Gilda, she tapped the 
taller woman on the shoulder to get her attention. &quot;(Gilda, can you tell 
her we...)&quot;

&quot;(Her throat is in pain,)&quot; Gilda said, turning away from the woman to 
face the nurse. &quot;(She says it itches from the inside.)&quot;

Sarah grimaced. &quot;Typhus...&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; The doctor asked. Turning towards the other nurse who was still 
cleaning, he snapped his fingers to get her attention. &quot;Lieutenant 
Buckingham, turn that damned radio off. Between her cough and that junk 
I can&#39;t even hear myself think.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not junk,&quot; the younger nurse said defensively, &quot;It&#39;s Benny 
Goodman.&quot;

&quot;Off!&quot;

With a pout, the nurse turned off the offending radio. The music 
stopped, but strangely enough so did the coughing. Sarah strode past 
Gilda, checked the patient for a pulse, and silently hung her head.

&quot;Well?&quot; Captain Rogers demanded.

&quot;She&#39;s dead,&quot; Sarah answered.

&quot;God damn it,&quot; Rodgers grumbled. &quot;Just what I need on my record. 
Buckingham, go tell Sergeant Moynahan to send in two of his men to get 
rid of the body, then...&quot; the doctor was interrupted by a corporal who 
just then burst through the door to the examination room. &quot;What, doesn&#39;t 
the army teach anyone to knock anymore?&quot;

&quot;S-sorry captain,&quot; the corporal nervously said as he quickly saluted. 
&quot;Master Sergeant Reynolds reports we&#39;ve not received the scheduled 
penicillin.&quot;

&quot;Damned army,&quot; Rogers cursed. &quot;Buckingham, get two of Sergeant 
Moynahan&#39;s men. Shore, baby sit the Polish translater for me. Corporal, 
bring me to talk to the Master Sergeant.&quot;

In a huff Captain Rogers and the corporal left the room, followed by Lt. 
Buckingham. Sarah suddenly found herself alone with Gilda for the first 
time since their meeting behind barrack number five (well, alone except 
for the corpse on the examination table). &quot;G... Gilda, I want to 
apologize.&quot; Gilda looked neither surprised nor taken aback. Her facial 
expression didn&#39;t alter at all in fact, which unsettled Sarah. &quot;I want 
to apologize for the doctor&#39;s behavior.&quot;

Gilda wobbled closer to her. &quot;He&#39;s been here too long,&quot; she said, as if 
that explained everything. &quot;This place, it does that. It eats away at 
you, at your soul, until you can&#39;t feel anything for yourself or anyone 
else anymore.&quot; Meeting Sarah&#39;s gaze, she now looked sad. &quot;Leave soon, 
anoil, or it&#39;ll get to you as well.&quot;

Sarah came over and placed a hand on Gilda&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Did it get to 
you?&quot;

Gilda didn&#39;t answer. Instead, unable to meet Sarah&#39;s eyes any longer she 
sadly looked away. Both women felt awkward and out of place at that 
point, and neither were quite sure what to say or do next. Finally, 
Sarah broke the silence. &quot;I looked for you.&quot;

Gilda looked back at Sarah, genuine surprise evident in her eyes. &quot;You 
looked for me? Why?&quot;

Before Sarah could formulate an answer, a knock was heard at the door to 
the exam room. Both women watched as two privates came in carrying a 
stretcher and wearing scarves over their mouths and noses to fight off 
the stench. They quickly picked up the dead body, put it rather roughly 
on the stretcher, and left the room.

&quot;Your eyes.&quot;

Gilda looked quizzically back over to the nurse. &quot;What?&quot;

Sarah suddenly felt self-conscious under the other woman&#39;s stare. &quot;Your 
eyes. I looked for you because they were pretty. They were the only 
thing of beauty I saw since arriving here.&quot;

Gilda stared wide-eyed at Sarah, unable to process the compliment. It 
had been so long since anyone had flattered her that she wasn&#39;t sure how 
to take it. &quot;I don&#39;t understand. Do... Do you want something?&quot;

Sarah shook her head. &quot;No, I don&#39;t, I...&quot; just then, a knock on the door 
signaled that Captain Rodgers had returned. As the doctor looked through 
a pile of paperwork he was carrying while grumbling to himself, Sarah 
quickly came up to Gilda. Tracing the pink triangle she whispered &quot;I&#39;m 
one too.&quot;

&quot;Lieutenant Shore.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir,&quot; the nurse replied, turning away from the now visibly shocked 
Gilda Grozheim to deal once more with her superior, &quot;What do you want, 
sir?&quot;

&quot;A transfer stateside.&quot; Looking up with a yawn, he motioned to the door. 
&quot;But until I get one, you can send the next Pole in.&quot;

Sarah nodded and turned towards the door, waiting until her back was 
turned before making a face.

The next few hours seemed to crawl by, as one woman inmate after another 
came into the examination room. The doctor would ask a question, Sarah 
would then translate it as closely as possible into Yiddish for Gilda, 
and Gilda would then attempt to translate the Yiddish into Polish for 
the woman being examined. When the patient answered, the process was 
repeated in reverse. It was lengthy and ponderous, but it worked, and by 
the end of the shift they&#39;d only had one other patient inconveniently 
die on them.

The doctor left the room as Sarah was cleaning the examination table. 
Gilda looked from the attractive young nurse back down to her star of 
David with its pink triangle. &quot;You&#39;re one too.&quot;

Sarah looked up, and smiled. &quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking, and no, I&#39;m 
not thinking of taking advantage of you.&quot; Gilda was not, however, 
thinking of that, but decided to keep still while her angel continued. 
&quot;I... I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been in the Army Medical Corps for close to 
three years now, and in all that time you&#39;re the first person like me 
that I&#39;ve met. I&#39;d like to be your friend, if you&#39;d let me. I&#39;d like to 
get to know you, but more than anything I want to try to help you. I 
don&#39;t think I could take the first person like myself that I&#39;ve met in 
three years dying in a place like this. Does that make sense?&quot;

Gilda looked intently at Sarah for a few moments before the corners of 
her lips slowly curled up into a smile. &quot;Friends,&quot; she said, holding out 
her hand.

&quot;Friends,&quot; Sarah replied happily as she took Gilda&#39;s hand in hers and 
warmly shook it. She then went over to a nearby cupboard and, opening 
it, pulled out a small apple. &quot;For you,&quot; she said, handing it over.

&quot;Thank you, anoil.&quot;

Sarah looked amused. &quot;What does that word mean? You know, the one you 
keep calling me. Ani... ana...&quot;

&quot;Anoil,&quot; Gilda gently corrected, &quot;It means &#39;angel&#39;.&quot;

Sarah blushed at the compliment. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;Go ahead, eat it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I will,&quot; Gilda said. &quot;But I want to wait until I can share it with 
Anja.&quot;

&quot;Anja?&quot; Sarah asked, suddenly feeling an unwanted tinge of jealousy, 
&quot;Who&#39;s she?&quot;

&quot;An old woman who sort of adopted me when I first arrived,&quot; she 
explained, earning an unexpected sigh of relief from Sarah. &quot;She&#39;s one 
of the political prisoners, a communist.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Sarah said. Looking up at the wall clock, she noticed the time. 
&quot;Nix!&quot;

&quot;Sarah? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to be leaving soon,&quot; Sarah whispered. The thought of 
leaving Gilda behind, after searching for her for so long, now seemed 
quite unbearable. Her mind racing, she did a quick mental inventory of 
the supply closet in the other room. &quot;Gilda,&quot; she said, turning to her 
new friend with a determined look, &quot;How fast do you think you can get to 
your friend Anja and back?&quot;

Gilda tilted her head a bit and pondered. &quot;I&#39;m not sure. Why?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a few surplus nurses uniforms, as well as some army fatigues, 
stored in a nearby room. If you get back in time, how would you like to 
leave this place and spend the night at camp with me?&quot;

&quot;Leave Dachau?&quot; Gilda asked, not quite believing she&#39;d heard right. 
&quot;With you?&quot;

Sarah smiled giddily as she nodded her head. &quot;I have a bunkmate,&quot; she 
said excitedly, &quot;But she&#39;s on furlough. Normally I take the lower bunk, 
but something tells me it&#39;ll be easier if you sleep down there tonight, 
and I can take the top. We can talk and share some cookies my mom sent 
me and...&quot;

&quot;It sounds wonderful,&quot; Gilda conceded, &quot;But what if we get caught?&quot;

&quot;Leave everything to me,&quot; Sarah answered. &quot;So, what do you say?&quot; she 
asked, giving Gilda a pleading look.

Gilda smiled. &quot;Very well. I&#39;ll be back as soon as I can.&quot; She placed the 
apple in a pocket of her prison uniform and walked out as quickly as her 
thin legs would allow her. Sarah followed, turning once out in the 
hallway to head to the supply closet. As she went in and began rummaging 
through the clothing, she chuckled to herself as she remembered the last 
time she&#39;d done something this foolhardy.

It had been in autumn of &#39;41, and as the sun set Sarah snuck out into 
the night dressed for a night out. Still a nursing student back then, 
she&#39;d heard through a third or fourth party about an underground 
nightclub in Greenwich Village. So, one taxi cab ride and two subway 
rides later she found herself out in the unfamiliar surroundings. 
Summing up her courage, she made her way towards the address.

She finally found it, and got close enough to hear the music coming out 
of the jukebox, before the police sirens began to blare. Fear seized 
Sarah, her heart felt like it was going to leap out of her chest. She 
turned and ran for her life, heading into a nearby alley as the lights 
of the police cars filled the night sky. Diving behind a garbage can, 
she timidly looked up to see the police raiding the lesbian nightclub, 
dragging out women who tried to hide their faces as the press 
photographer who was with the cops clicked away. The women screamed and 
shouted obscenities, the cops laughed, and the cameraman continued away, 
no doubt thinking of the big headlines that would go with his photos in 
tomorrow&#39;s newspaper. It was all too horrible for Sarah, and she had to 
look away.

That&#39;s when she realized she wasn&#39;t alone. In the shadows she made out 
the outline of a woman who was crouched down in hiding like her. Her 
fellow fugitive held a finger up to her mouth signaling for Sarah to 
keep quiet (like she needed instruction on the matter).

Finally, as the final &quot;criminal&quot; was loaded into the paddy wagon (a 
butch who&#39;d been knocked out by a billy club), the police and press 
photographer left. The other woman in the alley slowly made her way 
over. &quot;Are you alright? They didn&#39;t hurt you did they?&quot;

&quot;No, I... Jess Sullivan?&quot; Sarah asked, shocked to see one of her fellow 
nursing students.

&quot;Sarah? Sarah Shore?&quot; the other woman asked in amusement. &quot;Fancy meeting 
you here.&quot;

&quot;Humph, this isn&#39;t funny,&quot; Sarah grumbled, standing up and cautiously 
making her way out of the alley into the street. &quot;My skirt is ruined, 
I&#39;ve now got a run in my stockings, and look at my broken heel.&quot;

Jess just chuckled. &quot;Come on,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s grab the subway down to 
83. We&#39;ll go to my apartment, and get you cleaned up. &#39;K?&quot;

Sarah sighed. &quot;Very well.&quot; And so, what had begun as an attempt to enter 
her first lesbian nightclub had ended instead with her spending the 
first of many evenings at Jess&#39; flat.

Back in the present, Sarah had gathered a pair of worn women&#39;s army 
boots that looked to be about the right size, as well as fatigues and a 
white labcoat. She was stuck as to how to hide Gilda&#39;s shaved head, when 
she suddenly heard pattering on the roof of the building.

&quot;Anoil.&quot;

Sarah turned to see Gilda watching her, the taller woman&#39;s shoulders wet 
from the rain shower that had just started outside. A large grin slowly 
formed on the nurse&#39;s face.

A few minutes later, two women wearing heavy hooded rain ponchos made 
their way to one of the transport trucks with the red cross painted on 
the side. The smaller one led the taller woman to the back of the 
vehicle.

&quot;Sit on the inside next to the window,&quot; Sarah whispered as nurses and 
other medical personnel filed into the vehicle all around them. &quot;Just 
keep quiet, and let me do all the talking.&quot;

Gilda nodded silently. As the engine started up, Sarah reached over and 
took Gilda&#39;s hand in hers, the two women&#39;s fingers intertwining as the 
vehicle left the death camp and headed out.
