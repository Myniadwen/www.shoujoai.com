<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 18 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>      Tsuru didn&#39;t know anyone at this house and yet she decided to come anyway. Alright, 
maybe she did know that Krystal and Isaka were coming... and there had been the promise of 
seeing the heartbreaking visage of Tycara, but still! To make matters worse, she was here, 
by herself, not even accompanying Isaka and Krystal, whom invited her along.

      Now she was on the doorstep and since she already rang the bell, it was too late to 
escape. The person who opened the door was really, really pretty and for a moment, Tsuru 
thought everything was going to be okay.

      &quot;...hey... are you a lesbian pirate?&quot;

      Unfortunately for Tsuru, Abby opened the door. The blue haired girl cringed. &quot;N-no! 
I&#39;m not a pirate, just because I have my eye bandaged doesn&#39;t mean - how do you know I&#39;m 
gay?!&quot;

      &quot;Because every girl that comes to this house is gay,&quot; Abby said, matter of factly. 
&quot;Well, except one... hey, maybe that&#39;s why Mina&#39;s mom never wants to come over!&quot;

      Tsuru just stood there, still admiring the woman. She was still really pretty, even if 
she was mean. &quot;But you&#39;re Isaka&#39;s friend, right? Glad to add you to the cavalry... this is 
going to be one heck of a night.&quot;

      Tsuru followed the mother inside and was steamrolled by the next sight to meet her 
eyes.

      &quot;Lemme see, lemme see!&quot; A red head wearing a baseball cap was currently tugging on the 
pants of a girl with oddly green hair.

      &quot;No! Faye - it&#39;s for later and - gah! Stop it, everyone&#39;s going to see...!&quot; Erin 
whined out, trying to wrestle away from her girlfriend.

      &quot;What do you expect?&quot; Faye asked, now flush up against the back of her lover and 
holding tightly onto the belt loops of her jeans. &quot;You can&#39;t whisper in my ear about the 
sexy lingerie you&#39;re wearing and just leave it at that, you naught little snake!&quot;

      As the struggle continued, Tsuru stared. It was... it was like paradise. Abby snapped 
her fingers in front of her face to get her attention. &quot;You&#39;ll have to excuse our resident 
sex freaks. I&#39;m Abby, and the crazy one is Faye and her unfortunate soon to be depantsed 
victim is Erin.&quot;

      How the blonde woman said it all with a straight face was beyond her. &quot;Oh, and that 
man sitting at the table, hiding his face in a textbook is Seth,&quot; Abby said, pointing to the 
obviously distraught Seth at the dining table. &quot;He&#39;s trying to pretend that Faye and Erin 
don&#39;t turn him on, but if you take a quick peek under the table-&quot;

      &quot;Shut up, Abby!&quot; was his choked, embarrassed reply. Tsuru started to wonder what kind 
of friends Isaka and Krystal had...

      &quot;Mommy! The pot roast is almost done,&quot; a girl said, coming out of the kitchen. She 
looked almost 16-ish, with blonde hair tied up in a ponytail. Abby nodded and headed over to 
the kitchen.

      Mommy. The teenager had called Abby mommy, so that meant Abby was... Tsuru silently 
put it together in her head and realized that this girl had a very attractive mother.

      &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Eveon,&quot; the girl said.

      &quot;Oh, my name is Tsuru. I&#39;m friends with Isaka and Krystal.&quot; Eveon suddenly turned 
towards where a lot of yelling and commotion was coming from. Apparently, Erin and Faye had 
done everyone a favor (or maybe a disservice) by moving to a nearby room.

      The doorbell rang and Eveon went to answer. Eveon was kind of cute too, a bit young, 
but cute. Tsuru watched her open the door and get swept up in an embrace by another girl. 
The blue haired girl looked awkwardly away as Mina kissed her girlfriend on the lips.

      &quot;Oh, Eveon, I missed you...&quot; Mina murmured, coming inside. Eveon only laughed.

      &quot;We&#39;ve been apart... just a couple of hours.&quot;

      Tsuru sat down at the dining room table, across from Seth. Eveon and Mina were so... 
so... cute! She couldn&#39;t help but internally gush over their young, innocent love. Seth 
looked up from his book at Tsuru.

      &quot;It&#39;s kind of hard to adjust to, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Tsuru didn&#39;t quite catch his meaning. &quot;I 
meant, with all the lesbians here and how pretty they are and stuff. It&#39;s really odd.&quot;

      Tsuru nodded. &quot;Oh yes it is... actually-&quot; The blue haired girl was suddenly cut off 
when she saw something out of the corner of her eye.

      There was an angel descending the stairs. An angel... like on with wings. Tsuru stared 
and Sakura only stared back. &quot;Seth, am I hallucinating or is there actually an angel in 
front of me?&quot;

      The young man didn&#39;t even look up from his book. &quot;Nah, it&#39;s a real angel. It&#39;s okay, I 
almost pooped bricks too. It&#39;s natural.&quot;

      &quot;A-a real angel! Oh my God, how - what? Uh, er...&quot; Tsuru stood up. &quot;I&#39;m Tsuru, it&#39;s 
nice to meet you.&quot;

      &quot;...I&#39;m... Sakura,&quot; she said in a quiet voice, giving Tsuru a slight nod. &quot;Do you... 
know where Abby is?&quot;

      Tsuru motioned to the kitchen, unable to voice it. An angel... a real one! A total 
embodiment of purity and holiness had just been standing in front of her. &quot;Yep, she&#39;s 
actually Abby&#39;s lover so she&#39;s a lesbian too,&quot; Seth said with a small laugh. &quot;The only 
straight girl here... I mean, if you&#39;re not, would be my eleven year old girlfriend.&quot;

      Seth let out a sad sigh at the look he got from Tsuru. &quot;She&#39;s supposed to be 18 again 
later this year... I mean she was an adult and then she was reborn and now she has to grow 
up and it&#39;s so odd to be around her...&quot;

      Tsuru was sure she was in a crazy house. Definitely a crazy house. &quot;...exactly what is 
everyone? I mean, human, demon...?&quot;

      &quot;Well, we have angels, humans, demons and two horny goddesses,&quot; Seth said, thinking to 
himself. &quot;But we have some crosses between them and Abby is... well, Abby and Sakura have a 
thing set up where if one dies, so does the other, but if Sakura has a long life span from 
being an angel, Abby might live as long, too, so...&quot; Seth trailed off. &quot;I really don&#39;t know, 
Tsuru.&quot;

      Tsuru banged her head on the table. So many beautiful girls... all taken. Why? Why?! 
When she lifted her head, she noticed someone else coming down the stairs. It was a girl, 
much younger than anyone else, assumingly Seth&#39;s girlfriend.

      She had long silver hair and matching eyes and... and... Tsuru stiffened when she 
recognized the little girl. She looked a hell of a lot like Tycara. Their eyes locked and 
Tsuru was soon assaulted by a white blur.

      &quot;Tsuru! Tsuru! It&#39;s really you!&quot; Tycara said, wrapping her arms around the older 
woman.

      &quot;T-Tycara! What happened? You&#39;re... so young!&quot; Tsuru said in shock, too oblivious to 
notice the next couple that made it.

      &quot;Well, little miss danger prone,&quot; Isaka said, having just entered the house. &quot;Got 
herself killed protecting Abby.&quot;

      Tycara frowned a bit. &quot;But I didn&#39;t want Abby to die...&quot; The demon just ruffled 
Tycara&#39;s hair.

      Seth let out a small laugh. &quot;Well, Abby took Tycara&#39;s soul into her own body, planning 
on dying for her in return. Somehow, Abby slept with Sakura, got pregnant and gave birth to 
Tycara.&quot;

      Tsuru was stunned. &quot;Wait... so those two gave birth to a Tycara?! How... how&#39;s 
that...?&quot;

      &quot;Yep, I have two mommies now! Sakura was my real one and Abby&#39;s my new one!&quot; Tsuru 
just nodded at Tycara&#39;s declaration. This... was all so odd. She looked up to see Krystal 
giving her a sympathetic smile. 

***** 

      &quot;To the kitchen,&quot; Tycara said with glee, currently mounted on Tsuru&#39;s back. The blue 
haired girl had been suckered into being the little girl&#39;s ride, but she didn&#39;t mind at all. 
Tycara was such a cute child... It had taken Tsuru some time to understand the mechanics of 
how two women made a baby, but she eventually got it.

      Magic - that&#39;s all she needed to know. As they entered the kitchen, both girls spied 
Eveon and Mina inconspicuously cuddling in a corner. They were whispering things to each 
other and kissing and- Tsuru found it all... cute. Hell, she found a lot of things today 
cute. But two girls, so in love with each other right at that blossoming age-!

      It was almost too sugary for Tsuru to handle and apparently for Tycara as well. &quot;Ah, 
big sister is kissing Mina in the corner!&quot; This caused Eveon to jolt in surprise and smack 
into the cabinet behind her.

      &quot;Tycara! Stop doing that - you&#39;re picking up bad things from your Abby mommy again, 
aren&#39;t you?&quot; Eveon said, unhappy to be caught. Mina just giggled and held her girlfriend.

      &quot;But just think, Eveon. In a couple of months... maybe less, Tycara is going to be 
your big sister,&quot; the ebony haired girl said. Tycara scrambled off Tsuru&#39;s back to sit down 
in the stool and eat the different treats on the counter.

      &quot;Jeez, I wish I had someone when I was your age,&quot; Tsuru murmured wistfully, now 
feeling old. She actually had a crappy love life, now that she thought about it. She had a 
few kissing trysts, fondled regularly by a demon she hated, almost got screwed by a vampire, 
did get screwed aforementioned demon, got flat out rejected by a pretty straight girl who 
was now eleven years old and got screwed by the demon again. Lovely.

      Tycara had a sad look on her face. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Tsuru,&quot; she said through a mouthful of 
food.

      &quot;What, no! Don&#39;t be... don&#39;t be sorry.&quot;

      Eveon and Mina just watched the exchange with interest. &quot;Wait,&quot; the blonde started. 
&quot;Have you two-?&quot;

      &quot;No!&quot; Tsuru said quickly. She didn&#39;t want to bring up the painful memories and the two 
girls caught on. Suddenly all of them heard a voice coming near the kitchen.

      &quot;Hey Eveon... You&#39;re not smooching Mina in there, are you?&quot; At the distinct sound of 
Abby&#39;s voice, Eveon hid behind her girlfriend. Tsuru quickly ushered them out, allowing them 
to retreat to a remoter part of the house to cuddle.

      Abby entered with Sakura in tow, surprised to not see her daughter. &quot;Huh, where did 
she go? She&#39;s usually too busy with Mina to hear me when I catch her...&quot;

      Sakura on the other hand, was busy using a napkin to clean off Tycara&#39;s mouth. The 
young girl laughed happily and gave her mother a wet kiss on the cheek. Tsuru found it 
heartwarming and was happy that Tycara had a family to care for her. She watched as Abby 
came over and picked out things for her daughter to try from the plate.

      Tycara... Tsuru felt those past emotions in her chest, but they were gone. Now, she 
only felt that way with-

      The girl she&#39;d been thinking of walked in, engaged in some topic of discussion with 
Seth. Even though he was Tycara&#39;s boyfriend and Tsuru should dislike him, she found the 
young man easy to talk. Plus, it helped that he was the only normal one at the house... She 
locked eyes with Krystal, who only smiled. She motioned to Tsuru to follow her and the blue 
haired girl willingly did so.

      Krystal took a deep breath of air as she headed out onto the patio. The weather 
outside was still nice, even in the night. Tsuru sat down next to the other girl. Krystal 
actually looked nervous and solemn.

      &quot;Isaka told me about the things she did to you.&quot; Tsuru flinched. Did she now? She 
hated thinking about it, thinking about all that. It was a lot easier just to get into 
stupid fights with the demon instead of actually confronting their problems.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Krystal said. &quot;I didn&#39;t know... I didn&#39;t know she was really capable of 
those things. I mean, she&#39;s always been very physical, but what she did to you-&quot;

      &quot;Please don&#39;t apologize,&quot; Tsuru said. &quot;You aren&#39;t her keeper, you aren&#39;t the one that 
controls her actions. She... she&#39;s just stupid. Utterly and truly stupid. It&#39;s my fault for 
actually thinking she liked me or that she was capable of reading my emotions. She&#39;s not. 
And it&#39;s not you who should apologize...&quot;

      Krystal shook her head and let out a small laugh. &quot;When she told me, it seemed so odd. 
I didn&#39;t want her to feel bad, so I haven&#39;t actually... mentioned what I think about it, 
but,&quot; She bit her lip nervously. &quot;Tell me... does she always do that with girls?&quot;

      Tsuru couldn&#39;t help but look away from those deep blue eyes. Krystal was way too good 
for Isaka... way too good. Hell, she was even too good for Tsuru! How could this girl... how 
could this girl end up with Isaka?

      &quot;...I really don&#39;t know what she does to other girls that much, I know she sleeps with 
them and that&#39;s about it. If she likes a girl, she&#39;ll stay with her for a bit until she... 
gets bored.&quot; Tsuru mumbled the last part, looking away from Krystal. This was a horrible 
situation to be in - trying to be honest with a girl dating a total whore. Great.

      Tsuru could see the sadness on Krystal&#39;s face so she quickly asked her how she met 
Isaka. Krystal recounted the tale faithfully from their first meeting, to the soul prison 
and even how Seth broke up with her. Tsuru felt disgust for the demon. Of course she would 
take advantage of Krystal in the same way - be the rebound and reap all the rewards.

      Krystal let out a long sigh. &quot;I guess she kind of tricked me into being her 
girlfriend, but I do love her... I love her very much, so...&quot; She gave Tsuru a bright smile. 
&quot;Even if... even if she leaves me soon, I think it&#39;s better than if I never loved her at 
all. If my heart gets broken, then... then it will be fine. I know it will be fine. She 
promised she&#39;d stay with me, but you never know. I&#39;m only human...&quot;

      Tsuru couldn&#39;t understand how she could say it all with a hint of a smile. This was 
unfair. Isaka didn&#39;t deserve her, not at all. If Tsuru-! If Tsuru were her lover, she would 
never leave her, never make her question her fidelity. Even as Krystal aged, Tsuru would... 
she would be there, because the physicality didn&#39;t matter - it didn&#39;t matter because Krystal 
was more beautiful on the inside.

      The blonde gave her a sad look. &quot;That&#39;s probably what&#39;s going to happen, isn&#39;t it? She 
tells me she loves me all the time, but I know she might be saying that because she thinks 
she should.&quot;

      That was when Tsuru realized that this... this was her chance. Krystal was so 
distraught over her relationship with Isaka that she was on the edge... on the edge of 
ending it. If, if Tsuru gave it a slight nudge, just a little push, Krystal would be free. 
And if Krystal were free... well Tsuru didn&#39;t want to play rebound, but she could easily 
snatch her up and show her what real love was.

      Isaka would then be without Krystal and Tsuru would have a shot at it. She could 
actually love and spend time with one of the most beautiful girls she&#39;d ever met. Krystal 
was everything she wanted and more. And she would stick by her no matter what... Tsuru knew 
it would be easy - the seed of doubt was already there and for good reason! Chances were 
that the demon would leave her for some other pretty girl once Krystal was no longer fun for 
her.

      Then Tsuru could be the one that Krystal kissed and hugged and spoke so highly about. 
Likewise, she would be the one to hold her hand, kiss away her tears and share a home with. 
All it would take would be... the truth. She didn&#39;t even have to lie - Isaka wasn&#39;t the 
least bit faithful.

      Tsuru felt her throat get dry and her chest was filled with emotion. This could be 
it... her key to happiness, right here. Krystal. She turned to face those beautiful blue 
eyes. They were so sad, but hopeful... oh so hopeful for the one that she loved.

      &quot;Sh...she,&quot; Tsuru stuttered out. &quot;She told you that she loved you?&quot;

      Krystal nodded, unsure of herself.

      &quot;She really does love you Krystal. Isaka&#39;s never said that to a girl, save for her 
older sister when she was human and... and it&#39;s been forever since she did that to me. 
Isaka&#39;s a lot different now and just how she acts around you,&quot; Tsuru choked out, her heart 
clenching painfully, &quot;Isaka loves you and you have nothing to worry about.&quot;

      Krystal&#39;s eyes widened and a relieved smile broke out on her face. &quot;Really? You think 
so...?&quot;

      Tsuru could only nod, ready to vomit. Krystal gave her a hug and the blue haired girl 
had to fight back her tears.

      She just gave up her chance at happiness, all for the biggest bitch in the world, 
Isaka. She could have told Krystal otherwise, that just because Isaka had changed didn&#39;t 
mean she was faithful and... and... Krystal&#39;s body was so warm, her form so soft and god 
damn it! Why the hell did she do that?! Why did she tell Krystal that it was okay?

      Tsuru bit down on her lip. She did it... she did it because of the look in Krystal&#39;s 
eyes. She would have been devastated if Tsuru  skewed her words. It hurt so much and all she 
could think about were all the things Isaka could do with Krystal - all the things they 
could spend time doing. Just talking to each other... even the simple brush of their 
hands... It was something Tsuru was never going to experience because she had to go and be a 
flipping martyr and give away her shot at some happiness just because it was...

      It was the right thing to do...

      Once the hug ended, Tsuru got up. &quot;I&#39;m glad you feel better, Krystal,&quot; she said, 
trying to keep her composure under control.

      &quot;No, no. Tsuru, please. You&#39;ve been so kind to me... if there&#39;s anything you want in 
return, just tell me, okay? I owe you,&quot; Krystal said.

      Tsuru could only give her a wry smile. Such an inviting offer... but she couldn&#39;t get 
what she wanted. Krystal&#39;s love belonged to someone she hated more than anything... the type 
of person who always gets what they want no matter what they do. Maybe the thing that pissed 
Tsuru off the most was knowing Isaka did genuinely care for Krystal.

      &quot;I think I&#39;m going to go inside now,&quot; Tsuru murmured, getting a goodbye from her 
crush. On her way in, she passed by Isaka.

      &quot;Is Krystal over here?&quot; the demon asked. Tsuru felt that anger build up again.

      &quot;Yes, she&#39;s waiting for you.&quot; Isaka was going to chide back with some smart aleck 
response until she noticed the pain and cloudiness in Tsuru&#39;s visible eye. The demon watched 
her retreating back instead.

      Isaka felt a twinge of guilt, but what was she supposed to do? Everything she did was 
out of... well, she guessed out of love for herself but even out of care for Tsuru. She 
didn&#39;t try and ruin her life - hell, she really did think they were friends with benefits 
and Tycara was a lesbian.

      She brushed all those thoughts from her mind when she spied Krystal sitting on the 
patio. &quot;Hey there,&quot; the demon said casually. She was rewarded with a timid smile.

      As she sat down, she thought of words to say to her girlfriend. Isaka was going to try 
and explain her feelings to her so- Her thoughts were immediately cut off when Krystal laid 
her head on her shoulder. The blonde carefully intertwined their fingers, a smile on her 
face. The demon didn&#39;t know what to say and simply sat there, silent.
