<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>      Eveon gave Bakra a confused look. &quot;Wait - so those three incestuous sisters want to 
use Krystal as a vessel?&quot;

      Isaka was biting a nail anxiously. &quot;Oh, crap... what if they&#39;re molesting her?&quot;

      Tsuru ground her teeth. &quot;Oh no... they probably are!&quot;

      Abby spared them a glance and then sighed. &quot;So, excusing tweedledee and tweedledum 
over there, exactly what are you going to do?&quot;

      The male demon shrugged. &quot;Considering most of you are inhuman beings with great 
powers, I propose we all go rescue her.&quot;

      Everyone exchanged glances. &quot;We&#39;re in,&quot; Faye said proudly and Erin nodded.

      &quot;We&#39;re going to kick their asses!&quot; Isaka and Tsuru said in unison, creeping the hell 
out of Bakra. They shouldn&#39;t be getting along that well...

      Sakura quietly raised her hand. &quot;I no longer have the powers of the Living Inferno, 
but I can still fight and use angel magic.&quot;

      Bakra looked over at Tycara who smiled sheepishly. &quot;I... don&#39;t have all my powers 
because my mommy got them while she was pregnant with me.&quot;

      Abby looked stunned. &quot;I... I did? Since when did I have the heaven and hell blades?!&quot;

      Sakura gave her a small smile and grabbed her hand. &quot;Probably when you came to save me 
from Eska.&quot; Abby could only blush as Sakura tinkered with her fingers, reminding her of 
events just a little over an hour ago in bed.

      As the couple continued their cuddling, Seth piped up. &quot;These girls are servants for 
the Demon Lord, right? I should probably come along with my text books in case my research 
on the occult helps us out.&quot;

      Bakra grinned and gave him a pat on the shoulder. &quot;Great! It will be a big help.&quot; It 
was then that the demon noticed all the looks he was getting. He slowly retracted his hand 
and instead pretended to smooth out his hair.

      &quot;Well, we&#39;re staying home,&quot; Eveon said simply.

      Mina nodded. &quot;Yep, we don&#39;t have anything to contribute so we&#39;d just be a liability.&quot;

      Abby, who was caught up in Sakura nipping at her ear, immediately perked up at that. 
&quot;Like hell you are!&quot;

      The two girls looked stunned. &quot;I&#39;m not going to leave you two alone, in the house, 
after giving you the sex talk! What do you think you&#39;re doing, Eveon?!&quot;

      Eveon shot up. &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?! How do you know if we&#39;re going to do 
it tonight?! And what if we just want to be considerate? Do you want us to do it while 
you&#39;re at home? Shoot - you and Sakura screw each other almost every night and guess who has 
to hear it... me, you freaking hypocrite of a mother!&quot;

      Abby faltered at that. &quot;W-well, I&#39;m just not giving you the opportunity to let Mina 
enact her wild fantasies on you!&quot;

      It was Eveon&#39;s turn to be shocked. &quot;Wh... what are you talking about?&quot; Mina just 
smiled innocently.

      &quot;Oh, Melanie tells me about all the things your girlfriend writes in her diary, so 
don&#39;t you think I&#39;m going to let you be a willing participant in them!&quot;

      Eveon turned around to look at Mina. &quot;First you get the sex talk from Isaka and 
Krystal and now you have a list of dirty things you want to do to me?!&quot;

      Mina, however, didn&#39;t share Eveon&#39;s shyness. &quot;Why? Do you want to read it sometime so 
we can agree on things?&quot;

      The blonde girl was shocked. &quot;Ah... ah, th-that&#39;s alright and... Mina! You still owe 
me two favors for the poker game and for the bet on Sakura&#39;s gender, so don&#39;t you get any 
crazy ideas!&quot;

      Abby butted in again. &quot;What?! What favors? Eveon - you&#39;re supposed to be the 
submissive puppy, not the instigator!&quot;

      Eveon scoffed at her mother. &quot;Whatever - just because I don&#39;t bend to Mina&#39;s will like 
you do to Sakura doesn&#39;t mean you have to get so mad.&quot; She shot her mother a smug look.

      Abby froze up, her face bright red. Could this really be happening? She just... she 
just lost in a verbal lashing of her daughter! She was now the butt of the joke... unless... 
unless...

      She grinned and turned to the side. &quot;Right... which is why you always get hot and 
bothered when Mina comes over. Don&#39;t think I don&#39;t know about your special time in the 
bathroom.&quot;

      Checkmate - Eveon was never going to beat her. Her daughter looked utterly horrified. 
&quot;M-M-Mommy!!! How do you know that? Do you... do you listen in when I... in the bathroom, 
but- but-&quot; She looked around, only to see everyone else in the room finding other things 
interesting rather than the mother-daughter spectacle.

      Even Mina was blushing bright red. Eveon stamped her foot on the ground. &quot;Come on! I&#39;m 
sure you all do it too!&quot;

      Sakura was the one who spoke. &quot;But not everyone gets caught by both their mothers.&quot;

      As if she couldn&#39;t be embarrassed enough, Eveon now knew that her angel mother had 
overheard her during her personal time as well. Awesome. Truly awesome.

      Abby clasped her hands together. &quot;Unless you want me to go into more detail, Eveon, I 
suggest you come along!&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Alright,&quot; Seth said, looking at a book. &quot;If they&#39;re going to summon the spirit of the 
Demon Lord back into Krystal&#39;s body, then they&#39;re going to use an area of high spiritual 
power around here.&quot;

      Erin smiled. &quot;That&#39;s easy. If we triangulate the locations of the snake shrine, 
Isaka&#39;s home and the soul field, we should find a structure that they&#39;re hiding in.&quot;

      Faye hugged her girlfriend. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s my Erin! So smart...&quot;

      &quot;A soul field?!&quot; Seth exclaimed. &quot;There&#39;s a soul field around here?&quot;

      Sakura nodded. &quot;Of course, there are many around, just not easily found.&quot;

      Abby looked over at Isaka. &quot;What the hell is a soul field?&quot;

      The demon shrugged. &quot;I understand I&#39;m a mythical creature, but I don&#39;t know what it 
is.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s the gathering point of lost souls and sometimes a gateway to another place. A 
lot of energy gathers there as well,&quot; Tsuru stated. &quot;It&#39;s... like a fountain. No one really 
bothers them because they don&#39;t do much.&quot;

      Bakra sighed. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t they be at the Demon Lord&#39;s castle? It&#39;s really close here and 
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s in between all those three places.&quot;

      Everyone turned around to face him. Isaka grabbed him by the collar. &quot;You already know 
where she&#39;s at?! Why didn&#39;t you speak up before?&quot;

      &quot;Well you were all really into that soul field stuff, so...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;...Tsuki.&quot;

      The brunette ignored Krystal, her eyes still hollow, a smile painted on her face. She 
tried again. &quot;Tsuki, please...&quot;

      Krystal was still stuck in the seal, unable to move. Hoshi had left with Hina to... do 
distasteful things. They told her how they knew Isaka and Tsuru and Tycara... but... did 
this mean she was going to become the next Demon Lord? It didn&#39;t make sense.

      &quot;I know this isn&#39;t what you want. Your sister is using you,&quot; Krystal said, trying to 
get a response from the younger girl. When Tsuki cried to her in the shrine... it was 
because of Hoshi&#39;s influence. She was the one corrupting her sisters and forcing them to do 
things they wanted.

      &quot;Big sister takes care of us,&quot; the girl said simply. &quot;If you allow it, I&#39;m sure big 
sister could take care of you too.&quot;

      Krystal grimaced. &quot;Tsuki! You&#39;re being controlled, but you have to fight it. Let me 
help you-&quot;

      &quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m all better now. Before I was sick because of you, but now I&#39;m not.&quot; 
Tsuki smiled at her.

      &quot;Whoever your master is, he&#39;s not a good person, Tsuki... I know you can beat whatever 
it is that&#39;s controlling you!&quot;

      Her cries went unheeded. &quot;Our master is a great man. You&#39;ll get to meet him soon, 
though...&quot; Tsuki trailed off and started to giggle as Hoshi came back into the room, a sick 
smile on her face.

      &quot;Tsuki? How about you go get Hina?&quot; Her younger sister got up and after a long kiss, 
left her big sister to watch over the seal.

      Hoshi was holding something in her hands and Krystal soon realized it was a set of 
clothes. &quot;We need you to be dressed nice to present to our master,&quot; she said simply. The 
blonde woman tried to move, but she was too lethargic from the seal to do so.

      She could only watch as Hina entered the room, tired, and tied her up with threads as 
Tsuki let down the seal. Krystal saw it as her chance to escape, but Hina kept her bound. 
Krystal realized with a sudden dread that they were going to be dressing her.

      &quot;I can put it on myself!&quot; she shouted to Hoshi. The silver haired woman only grinned.

      &quot;But that wouldn&#39;t be any fun, would it?&quot;

      Krystal shut her eyes and started to fight against the hands on her. Why did this have 
to happen?

      &quot;You won&#39;t be needing your bra,&quot; Hina said and Krystal let out a shout at the loss of 
her undergarment.

      After much prodding, harassment and nips, Krystal found herself in a white dress, 
still caught in the grasps of the three sisters.

      &quot;So pretty...&quot; Hina murmured out.

      &quot;I know, she&#39;s such a lovely girl,&quot; Hoshi said.

      Krystal tried to struggle against Tsuki who was stroking her hair. &quot;Let me go! I don&#39;t 
understand any of this - please!&quot; She looked over at Hoshi. &quot;Why are you doing this? Why did 
you train me?!&quot;

      Hoshi caressed her cheek. &quot;Quite simple - you have great potential and your power 
grows the more you train. Our master requires someone of your strength, so we did our best 
to hone it.&quot;

      The blonde woman blanched. &quot;What are you... what does your master want from me?&quot;

      Her only answers were their laughs before Hina tied her up again and Tsuki reset the 
seal. Hoshi looked over at her. &quot;We would love to explain it all, but I have to go finish up 
preparations for the ritual while my little sister takes care of your friends.&quot;

      Krystal tried to struggle against the lethargy of the seal. &quot;My friends? They&#39;re 
here?&quot;
