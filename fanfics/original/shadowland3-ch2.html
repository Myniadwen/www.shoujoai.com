<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Kimberly Harrison&#39;s disappearance, or death depending at how you looked 
at it, hung heavily over the Whispering Hills Academy, more so over the 
Western Dorms then anything else. As the girls of the Western Dorms 
gathered to eat dinner in the cafeteria the usually lively chatter in 
the cafeteria had been replaced with a low mummer as rumours of the days 
events drifted from table to table. The story of Jessica Wright&#39;s 
dismissal from her duties as the Dorm Head and the death/departure of 
Kimberly Harrison spread over plates of food rapidly and built into a 
roaring blaze within no time at all as people got their tales mixed up 
and became increasingly confused as to which of two girls, Kimberly or 
Kima were indeed gone. 

&quot;Did you feel that weird energy from earlier?&quot;
&quot;Yeah, it hit me so hard I feel out of my chair.&quot;
&quot;I nearly threw up. What was that all about?&quot;
&quot;I heard it was because the new girl died...&quot;
&quot;Which girl?&quot;
&quot;That redhead.&quot;
&quot;Which one? I hope it was Kima.&quot;
&quot;I heard it was the shy one.&quot;
&quot;She seemed so sweet. What was wrong with the other one?&quot;
&quot;Haven&#39;t you seen the way she looks at the girls here?&quot;
&quot;She creeps me out. I heard she forced herself on Natalie?&quot; 
&quot;Prince Harshaw? I thought she could beat anyone off her.&quot;
&quot;I think they are ex lovers. Alyson doesn&#39;t look please.&quot; 
&quot;Alyson Dalfort&#39;s girlfriend is Natalie?&quot;
&quot;What a shame. Alyson&#39;s so hot and sexy.&quot;
&quot;I know what you mean. I hope those two break up.&quot;
&quot;Did you hear about the Sisters of Death that where here to take 
Kimberly away.&quot; 
&quot;Sisters of Death?&quot;
&quot;Turns out Kris Tallet&#39;s little sister is one of them.&quot;
&quot;You don&#39;t mean that cute little kid with the different coloured eyes.&quot;
&quot;Yeah, she was with another Death Sister, I saw them together, wings and 
all.&quot;
&quot;Wait! Death Sisters can make their wings disappear? How will we know 
when one of them is here with us?&quot;
&quot;Hey, doesn&#39;t that mean that Kris is...&quot; 
&quot;There&#39;s a Death Angel living with us? I want to transfer to the Eastern 
Dorms now.&quot; 
&quot;Me too.&quot;
&quot;Same here.&quot;
&quot;I can&#39;t live with a Death Angel. That&#39;s just creepy.&quot; 
&quot;Everything has gone to hell since that stupid red head arrived. I wish 
both of them would just disappear.&quot;

Somewhere at the back of the cafeteria came a heavy metal crash as 
something slammed upon the table with enough force to echo across the 
large hall and cause most of the girl&#39;s to be startled out of there 
conversations and turn to face what had caused such a ruckus. 

Natalie stood at the back of the room, her black leather jacket and long 
blonde hair glistening in the last rays of sunlight that drifted through 
the large picture windows, a window that covered one half of the 
cafeteria wall, her powder blue eyes angrily scanning the many girls 
that where willing to greet her gaze. 

&quot;You all make me sick!&quot; She shouted, causing several girls to turn away 
from her accusing glares, &quot;Whispering like kindergarteners when one of 
your dorm mats has died. Don&#39;t any of you care about her feelings?&quot; 

&quot;How can you defend a slut like that?&quot; A girl with buzzed cut dirty 
blonde hair, torn jeans, white t-shirt and jean vest spat, returning 
Natalie&#39;s glares as she stood to her feet, &quot;Or maybe you actually loved 
that little tramp.&quot; The girl said with a sly grin.	

Natalie leapt atop the table and rushed across it, swiftly stepping over 
trays of food and paper cups of drink as she easily jumped over the 
heads of girls, from one table to another. Before anyone could move 
Natalie was upon her prey, a long blade springing forth from its housing 
underneath the right sleeve of her jacket as she swung a fist at the 
girl. At that same moment the girl pulled out a large dagger from the 
belt of her jeans, a rippled blade of at least thirty centimetres in 
length with a white bone handle, and thrust it towards Natalie. Just 
before their blades were able to bite into each other a great force 
threw Natalie off her feet.

When Natalie looked down at what hit her and found a small brown haired 
pigtailed girl had her arms wrapped around her waist. &quot;GET OFF ME 
TANYA!!!&quot; Natalie snarled at the girl as the two of them tumbled over a 
table to the floor, scattering trays of food to the air, &quot;Let me go!&quot; 

Tanya hugged Natalie tightly as they slid across the floor between the 
lines of tables, &quot;Don&#39;t do it, Nat!!&quot; She cried out frantically, &quot;Don&#39;t 
waste your life on some brainless twit who doesn&#39;t know any better.&quot; 

&quot;She doesn&#39;t deserve to live.&quot; Natalie hissed, her blade arm slicing 
through a nearby table, sending a tray of food into the air and several 
girls scurrying for cover. &quot;Kim had more of a right to live then that 
bitch.&quot; She screamed, trying to free herself of the girl&#39;s grasp.

&quot;Who&#39;re you calling a bitch?&quot; Natalie&#39;s near victim pushed passed a 
growing group of gathering girls, flipped her dagger around in her hand 
and raised it above her head, aiming the tip at the back of Tanya&#39;s 
head, &quot;Tanya, you had better move before you get hurt.&quot; The girl warned 
as she prepared to plunge the dagger into the back of the girl&#39;s skull.

Swiftly Natalie rolled over Tanya and kicked out with a foot, knocking 
the girl&#39;s hand to the side while she tried to pull herself free of 
Tanya so she could better fight her opponent only to find Tanya&#39;s grip 
on her jacket was made of iron and she refused to release Natalie no 
matter how much she struggled, &quot;Tanya!! You&#39;re going to get us both 
killed you know that!?!&quot; She growled, keeping an eye on her attacker as 
she approached for another attack. 

Misty stood to her feet and stepped in front of the burly girl, &quot;Stop 
it. Both of you!&quot; She demanded, holding a hand up in front of the girl&#39;s 
face, &quot;Kelly, why don&#39;t you just back off for a change?&quot; 

&quot;Now you I expected to jump to a slut&#39;s defence.&quot; The girl snickered at 
Misty, waving the knife before Misty&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;Call me what you like.&quot; Misty stated coldly, not allowing the girl&#39;s 
weapon to cause her to back down, &quot;But I know who my friends are and I&#39;m 
not going to let you hurt them.&quot; Her eyes caught a familiar glimpse of 
long wavy blonde hair and she felt a slight relief, &quot;Emily, could you 
help Tanya with Natalie.&quot; She inquired of her friend, never letting her 
gaze move from Kelly&#39;s. 

Without a word the girl pushed through the crowd to Natalie&#39;s side, with 
Tanya&#39;s girlfriend, Cherilyn, right behind her, &quot;Come on Natalie.&quot; Emily 
said as she reached the girl&#39;s side, &quot;You don&#39;t need to lower yourself 
to her level.&quot; She stated as she took Natalie by one arm and helped her 
to her feet.

Cherilyn nodded in agreement, &quot;You&#39;re better then this. Come on, let&#39;s 
go.&quot; The two of them helped Tanya usher Natalie out of the cafeteria and 
on to the patio. 

Misty gave Kelly a warning glare and pointed a finger at the girl, 
touching the tip of the girl&#39;s knife which she suddenly realized was 
very sharp and tried hard to conceal the nervousness that was starting 
to well up inside of her, &quot;You&#39;re lucky Tanya was brave enough to stop 
Natalie because I would have allowed her to cut off your head.&quot; She 
stated, pushing the blade to the side.

&quot;I&#39;m reporting that psycho to the Head Mistress.&quot; Kelly snarled, patting 
the knife on her hand, &quot;She should be locked away, just like the rest of 
you.&quot; She said, pointing the dagger at the girls now on the patio and 
back to Misty.

&quot;You&#39;re the one who needs to be chained up.&quot; Misty commented, &quot;Next time 
I will allow Natalie to have her way with you and we&#39;ll see how tough 
you are.&quot; 

Kelly simply grinned, &quot;Anytime and while your at it invite your 
girlfriend to the party. Now that she is no longer dorm head I have a 
few things I would like to discuss with her.&quot;

Misty boldly took a step closer to the girl; &quot;Jessie is still Dorm Head 
here so you better keep that in mind before starting a fight around 
here.&quot; She explained with a broad grin upon her face, &quot;The Head 
Mistresses would not be too please if they found out you were 
threatening their Dorm Head.&quot; 

Kelly seemed taken back by this news, &quot;I heard Mistress Sophia fired her 
ass.&quot; 

&quot;Nope,&quot; Misty stated proudly, &quot;She was just given more help. Kris, that 
Death Angel you are all muttering about, is also a Dorm Head here so I 
would think twice before starting anything around here because I&#39;ve 
heard that she tore the wings off another Angel of Death, so she could 
make short work out of any of you.&quot; She said with a nod to the girls 
that had gathered around. 

A mummer filled the crowd as the idea of a Death Angel running the 
Western Dorms spread from one girl to another. Realizing she might have 
said too much Misty cautiously backed out of the cafeteria, quickly 
retreating out on to the patio and closing the sliding door behind her, 
only turning around when she was sure that no one was following her.
