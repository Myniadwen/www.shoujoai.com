<h1>Prophecy of Krishinda: The Kusagana Myth (part 4 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/krishinda-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&#147;It was extremely foolish of you to run out there like you did.&#148;
 
Mitsuki looked away from Genzo miserably as he started to yell at her. 
The two of them were in Genzo&#146;s room at the Tsukiyo Inn, and Genzo was 
reprimanding Mitsuki for running into the battle with the second 
devil. 
 
It wasn&#146;t like what she did was thought out rationally. Mitsuki saw 
Akira in trouble and she just acted. Her grandfather seemed to think 
that she wanted to put her life in danger. 
 
&#147;It was going to hurt Akira.&#148; Mitsuki said.
 
&#147;It was not your place to intervene.&#148; 
  
Mitsuki&#146;s eyes widened and sought out her grandfather&#146;s face. She 
could not believe he just said that.
 
&#147;Excuse me? Akira was in trouble and you didn&#146;t even bother to help 
her when you knew you could have! I could have lost Akira thanks to 
you!&#148; 
 
Mitsuki did not mean to yell at Genzo but just seemed to flow from 
her. Genzo himself understood why Mitsuki was so angry, but if Akira 
were ever to live up to her position as 113th knight of the Order, she 
would have to learn to fight for herself.
 
&#147;I was doing what I thought was best.&#148;
 
Mitsuki smiled sarcastically. &#147;You mean leaving her on her own to get 
killed?&#148;
 
&#147;I was allowing her to follow her own path.&#148; Genzo corrected. 
 
Mitsuki looked away again. &#147;That&#146;s no excuse.&#148;
 
A cough escaped Genzo&#146;s throat as he stood up from the chair he was 
sitting on. The ageing master walked over to the far window and looked 
out in contemplative thought.
 
&#147;That does not matter anymore. We cannot be satisfied with today&#146;s 
victory. We must travel north to Rz&#146;oawrein and find the next devil.&#148;
 
Mitsuki blinked. &#147;Is that all you care about? Fighting?&#148;
 
&#147;This isn&#146;t about me, Mitsuki. This is about Juukumei.&#148;
 
Mitsuki stood up and looked at her grandfather angrily.
 
&#147;What about me?!&#148; Mitsuki yelled.
 
Genzo turned around gradually and faced his granddaughter. The old man 
had an inquisitive look in his eyes.
 
&#147;What about you?&#148;
 
&#147;You&#146;re forcing me to marry a man I don&#146;t love!&#148; 
 
Genzo&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;I thought we had discussed this. Kai is the 
perfect man for you. He is intelligent, well established, and of good 
lineage. Your union would cement the ties between the clans of Kiryu 
and Soujumah. This is important to the future of our clan. Do you not 
see that?&#148;
 
Mitsuki was incredulous. Akira had told her to &#145;value&#146; Genzo but right 
now, the way she was feeling inside; Genzo could throw himself into 
hell, boil for an eternity and she still wouldn&#146;t give a lick.
 
&#147;Go to hell, grandfather.&#148;
 
And with that, Mitsuki left Genzo&#146;s room banging the door behind her. 
 
**********
 
Akira shed her armour and clothes once again. In her under-things, the 
young knight settled shakily on the bed. Trying her hardest not to put 
pressure on her ankle. It felt like it was injured. 
 
{It must have been when I dodged the second devil&#146;s energy blast.}
 
Just as Akira settled into a comfortable position, Mitsuki stormed 
into their room and the door behind her. The angry blonde cursed under 
her breath for a second, eliciting a curious look from Akira.
 
&#147;Uh...Mitsuki, is something wrong?&#148; Akira asked.
 
Mitsuki looked at Akira for a second, and shook her head. She was just 
glad that she had her best friend with her.   
 
&#147;I&#146;m okay. Just had a little argument with my grandfather.&#148;
 
The young healer walked over to the bed to sit down for a minute, when 
she saw the bandage around Akira&#146;s ankle. Mitsuki slid onto the bed 
and looked up anxiously.
 
&#147;You didn&#146;t hurt yourself, did you Akira?&#148;   
 
Akira sweat-dropped. The last thing she wanted was for Mitsuki to 
worry about her. 
 
Akira smiled briefly. &#147;It really is just a little scratch.&#148;
 
Mitsuki did not say anything to that, but she settled down peacefully 
next to Akira, and took a look at her ankle. The young healer looked 
back at Akira for a second.
 
&#147;I&#146;m going to see how bad it is, so this might hurt just a bit.&#148;
 
Akira nodded. Mitsuki then gently placed her hands on Akira&#146;s leg, 
slowly sliding down to the ankle. The dark haired girl bit her lip as 
Mitsuki probed her injury. Mitsuki was doing her best not to hurt her, 
so Akira tried to put her discomfort to one side. A few minutes later, 
Mitsuki finished with her gentle ministrations. 
 
&#147;Akira, I think it&#146;s broken. I don&#146;t know how you managed to walk on 
this thing.&#148; Mitsuki said.
 
Akira rolled her eyes. &#147;Yeah, well...&#148;
 
Mitsuki then smiled brightly at Akira. &#147;No prob, Akira! I can just 
heal it, so don&#146;t you worry!&#148;
 
Akira sighed briefly, and Mitsuki concentrated Mana-Ki through her 
hands. The young knight took a second to observe Mitsuki. She was 
always so very caring. Even now, although she was the team&#146;s healer, 
Mitsuki didn&#146;t have to do this for Akira. She was a true friend. And 
it made her sick to think about how close she came to losing her.
 
Mitsuki was still working on the healing process when Akira spoke.
 
&#147;Mitsuki...?&#148;
 
The blonde looked up but didn&#146;t stop the healing. &#147;Yes?&#148;
 
&#147;Promise me that you won&#146;t run out into the battle the way you did 
before...&#148;
 
&#147;But Akira...&#148;
 
Akira looked firmly yet tenderly at her best friend. &#147;Please?&#148;
 
The healing that Mitsuki preformed completely restored her Akira&#146;s 
ankle to its former glory. Mitsuki kneeled down on the bed and looked 
at Akira longingly. She wanted to protect Akira. The young knight 
meant so much more to Mitsuki then she realized. 
 
&#147;I don&#146;t want you to get hurt.&#148; Mitsuki whispered.
 
&#147;Mitsuki,&#148; Akira said, leaning forward and playing with a lock of the 
young healer&#146;s hair. &#147;If I don&#146;t know that you are safe, I will worry 
about you and make mistakes. Please do not be concerned about me. If 
anything, knowing that I have you to come back to will be the perfect 
incentive to stay alive. You have to promise me that you will not get 
involved...&#148;
 
Mitsuki nodded slowly. &#147;Okay. I promise.&#148;
 
**********
 
The next morning, Mitsuki yawned luxuriously as she woke up from her 
sleep. She was pretty well rested considering what happened the night 
before. The young healer looked over to her side in the hopes of 
seeing Akira, but she wasn&#146;t there. 
 
&#147;She must be downstairs. Oh well.&#148; 
 
Mitsuki&#146;s stomach then growled. She sweat-dropped and then got out of 
the bed.
 
{I guess I am kinda hungry.} Mitsuki thought.
 
Thinking that, the blonde slapped on her clothes and hurriedly made 
her way downstairs. 
 
**********
 
&#147;I still can&#146;t believe that girl killed one of the six devils.&#148; Anju 
said quietly. 
 
Anju and Miki were at table having breakfast with each other. They 
were both a little browbeaten by the amount of attention they were 
getting from neighbouring tables. Word had gotten around fast that 
they killed the devil that was stalking Soryu and the Heichi 
grasslands. People had been coming up to them and offered tokens of 
their thanks. Miki understood why they were doing this, but still it 
was unnecessary. 
 
&#147;Well, believe it. These people do.&#148; Miki said. 
 
Anju leaned back on the chair he was sitting on. 
 
&#147;Y&#146;know, when I first took up this job I thought it was a suicide run. 
But after what I saw of that girl yesterday...I&#146;m starting to think we 
can actually do this.&#148;
 
Miki grinned at him. &#147;If that was so, why even bother to join up with 
us? Be honest.&#148;
 
Anju looked deep into Miki&#146; sweltering jade eyes and smiled. 
 
&#147;I wanted to see you again.&#148; Anju said candidly.
 
Miki sighed and looked away from Anju. She thought that they had been 
over this.
 
&#147;I wish you would not say things like that.&#148;
 
&#147;You asked me to be truthful.&#148; 
 
Miki didn&#146;t say anything more to that. Anju could understand why Miki 
was acting this way. She had every right to want to stay away from 
Anju. Taking into consideration the history that was between the two 
of them, her actions were justified. But he still couldn&#146;t deal with 
it. Miki only knew so much about what happened back then. There was 
still so much that she didn&#146;t know. 
 
Anju could have told her what she didn&#146;t know now, but something just 
didn&#146;t feel right about that. He had to know if Miki still had...some 
sort of feelings for him. Seven years is a long time...   
 
Before Anju could say anything more, Mitsuki walked over to them from 
across the room. She too could see the stares and glances that the 
other boarders were giving them.
 
Miki let out a small sigh of relief when Mitsuki walked up to them. 
Anything that could get her out that conversation with Anju was 
welcomed in her book.
 
&#147;Morning sleepyhead. Are you hungry?&#148;
 
Mitsuki looked around the table. &#147;A little. Where&#146;s Akira?&#148;
 
Anju pointed over his shoulder. &#147;Outside.&#148;
 
&#147;What&#146;s she doing out there?&#148; Mitsuki asked confused.
 
Anju just shrugged. &#147;I dunno.&#148;
 
&#147;I think I&#146;ll go see her.&#148;
 
Miki looked curiously at Mitsuki for a second, and called out to her 
as she walked away. 
 
&#147;Wait. Don&#146;t you want something to eat? Genzo will be down soon.&#148;
 
Mitsuki scowled hatefully when she heard her grandfather&#146;s name, but 
didn&#146;t let Miki see it. She was the one who respected Genzo the most. 
    
&#147;No. I&#146;ll eat later.&#148; Mitsuki then walked away. 
 
Anju laid his arms behind his head and looked at the door Mitsuki had 
walked through. The girl always seemed so very bubbly, but one mention 
of her grandfather&#146;s name and she turned sour.
 
&#147;What&#146;s up with that kid?&#148; Anju asked.
 
Miki thought for a second. She had accidentally overheard the argument 
Mitsuki had with Genzo last night, and Miki knew there was still a 
little frustration in her. And then there was Akira...
 
&#147;Don&#146;t be hard on her. She does have a lot to struggle with.&#148;
 
Anju yawned. &#147;Like what?&#148;
 
Miki stayed silent for a second. &#147;She&#146;s...marrying Kai...&#148;
 
Anju&#146;s eyes widened in total surprise. He had no idea that Soujumah 
and Kiryu planned on uniting. And then here Anju was, trying so hard 
to...
 
The second of the Twelve Dragons looked at Miki wholeheartedly, trying 
his best to seem apologetic.
 
&#147;Miki...I&#146;m...sorry, I had no idea that-&#147;
 
Miki cut Anju off. &#147;I made my choice.&#148;
 
The hazelnut haired woman stood off of her chair and walked away 
silently. Anju was beating himself up inside. He may have put himself 
back ten spaces without even knowing it.
 
**********
 
Akira was outside the Tsukiyo Inn, sitting next to the wall, polishing 
her Dragon-edge. Genzo had once told her that a sword that is well 
maintained would bring good fortune. It seemed silly but Akira 
believed it. It was a well-known fact that Hyudo&#146;s sword, the 
Lightning-edge, was treated like a queen.
 
Akira smirked lightly. &#147;Am I picking up your habits, dad?&#148;
 
The young knight looked up as she saw a shadow cats over, and smiled 
sweetly at the girl standing there.
 
&#147;Morning Mitsuki.&#148; Akira said.
 
Mitsuki kneeled down onto the ground and looked at her Akira 
bashfully.
 
&#147;What are you doing out here all on your own?&#148; Mitsuki asked quietly.
 
Akira finished polishing her sword and sharply sheathed the blade. 
 
&#147;Just thinking about stuff.&#148;
 
Mitsuki looked curious. &#147;About what?&#148;
 
Akira smiled sadly. &#147;My dad.&#148;
 
Mitsuki shuffled a bit. She could relate to Akira and at the same 
time, Mitsuki&#146;s situation was nothing like Akira&#146;s. Mitsuki&#146;s parents 
had only passed on three years ago, after a devil attack. Akira had 
never really known her parents. Her mother disappeared and her father 
died in battle with the Tenshi-jin. 
 
&#147;Do you miss him?&#148; 
 
Akira nodded slowly. &#147;Yeah. Sometimes.&#148;
 
Mitsuki looked desperately at Akira for a second, the pulled her into 
a friendly, yet intimate hug. Akira easily settled in Mitsuki&#146;s arms. 
A lot of people in Zaakumaikyuu found the closeness between the two of 
them to be a little...strange, but Akira saw nothing strange in it. 
She loved holding her and being held by her. Things just felt safe 
that way.
 
&#147;You have me Akira. I&#146;ll always be here.&#148; 
 
Akira smiled again. &#147;I know.&#148;
 
Mitsuki then pulled back from Akira just enough to see her face. Akira 
was so very beautiful. Mitsuki had to admit, she had dreamt about 
Akira many times in the past. She had told herself to keep her 
feelings hidden, but Mitsuki couldn&#146;t take it anymore. Deep in the 
young healer&#146;s heart, a shred of hope that Akira may feel the same way 
still existed. 
 
Mitsuki blushed a bright crimson and looked at Akira awkwardly.
 
&#147;Akira...I...&#148;
 
The young knight gently rested her palm on Mitsuki&#146;s check, stroking 
her soft skin to reassure her. Mitsuki was never the type to be 
nervous unless it really meant something.
 
&#147;What is it, Mitsuki? You can tell me anything.&#148;
 
Unbeknownst to both Akira and Mitsuki, Miki was just a couple of 
metres away, watching the two of them. Her heart bled to see this. She 
wanted them both to be happy, she really did, but some things appeared 
to be more important than others.
 
&#147;Akira...I lo-&#147;
 
&#147;Akira.&#148; Miki said sharply. 
 
Akira and Mitsuki both looked around to see Miki behind them, and 
suddenly felt a little self-conscious. Not that they had any reason to 
be...right?
 
&#147;Akira,&#148; Miki began. &#147;Genzo needs to talk to you.&#148;
 
&#147;Right now? Okay.&#148; 
 
Akira quickly stood up and walked past Mitsuki into the Tsukiyo Inn, 
but not before winking at Mitsuki. Mitsuki blushed again, and smiled a 
small smile at her. When Akira was gone, Mitsuki stood up and looked 
at Miki irritably. 
 
&#147;We were just talking.&#148; Mitsuki said angrily.
 
&#147;You were going to tell her that you love her, weren&#146;t you?&#148;
 
Mitsuki gasped. Did Miki know? She had no idea that anyone may have 
picked up on her feelings for Akira. Mitsuki could only look away 
sadly. 
 
&#147;I don&#146;t mind how you feel about her.&#148; Miki said. 
 
Mitsuki appeared surprised. &#147;You don&#146;t?&#148; 
 
Miki smiled. &#147;No.&#148; But became serious when she added, &#147;However you 
both have responsibilities. Don&#146;t go falling for her Mitsuki.&#148; 
 
Mitsuki shook her head and looked back at Miki. &#147;You&#146;re too late.&#148;
 
**********
 
Akira knocked on Genzo&#146;s door in the Tsukiyo Inn, hearing a gruff 
voice calling out to her. 
 
&#147;Come in.&#148; It was Genzo.
 
Akira opened the door a crack and saw Genzo sitting down on the bed, 
his thin legs crossed and his eyes closed. Apparently he was in some 
form of meditation. 
 
&#147;Master Kiryu, Miki said that you wanted to speak to me?&#148; Akira said. 
 
Genzo opened his eyes and threw a confused look at Akira, not knowing 
what she was talking about, but he chose to dismiss it. He had to 
speak to her anyway. 
 
&#147;I want to congratulate you on defeating the second devil. But there 
are still five more out there Akira. We must keep moving. Now, do you 
understand?&#148;
 
Akira nodded. &#147;Yes sir.&#148;
 
&#147;We will head north to Rz&#146;oawrein tomorrow. Be ready.&#148;
 
**********
 
The next day the gang packed up their things and decided to move on. 
Anju and Miki went down to the front desk to pay for their stay at the 
Tsukiyo Inn. 
 
Anju walked up to the main desk, and was about to get out the money 
needed to pay for the use of the Inn. 
 
&#147;So, how much do we owe you?&#148; Anju asked.
 
The owner of the Tsukiyo inn grinned at Anju, &#147;For others, 1000 gold 
pieces. For you, nothing.&#148;
 
&#147;Huh? Why?&#148;
 
&#147;After what you did for Soryu village, I couldn&#146;t dream of charging 
you. That devil had been terrorizing us for years. I just hope that 
you understand my thanks.&#148;
 
Anju smiled appreciatively. &#147;Thank you.&#148;
 
With that, Akira, Mitsuki, Miki, Anju and Genzo left the Tsukiyo Inn 
and Soryu Village.
