<a href="../original/allgirls-ch95.html">Back to Part 95</a><pre>&quot;Spring Break&#151;Road Trip&quot;

Spring Break was upon them, but what were they going to do? They 
couldn&#39;t afford to go on a real vacation and they didn&#39;t want to spend 
every day lounging around the house&#151;and besides, Mrs. Yi had earned a 
few days off. A solution did not present itself until just at the last 
minute (it seemed), for not a day before the week-long vacation did 
Ancelin overhear a conversation that would overall change her life. On 
the last Friday before the great holiday began, she overheard Ana and 
Rai chit-chatting during a lull in Mrs. Keys&#39; class. Hero was in on it 
as well, and since it was Friday and art class, Mrs. Keys let them talk 
as long as they wanted. Ancelin only overheard a few key parts, but the 
whole conversation went something like this:

&quot;Hey, you guys doing anything for Spring Break?&quot;

&quot;You know I&#39;m not,&quot; answered Rai stiffly. &quot;My mother practically kicked 
me out of the house after she learned of my &#145;coming out&#39; episode. The 
fool didn&#39;t even realize I&#39;d been that way for awhile now. Anyway, I&#39;m 
lodged somewhere else, either until she cools her jets or I find a real 
place to stay, so I&#39;ve really got nothing to do. What about you, Love?&quot;

&quot;My parents are going out of state to visit a buddy of theirs. They 
offered to take me along, and if I don&#39;t have any other options, I&#39;ll 
go. But I&#39;m game. What about you, Lulu?&quot;

&quot;My parents have a plan!&quot; she exclaimed happily. &quot;They said they&#39;re 
spending the week in a summer house they co-own with some relatives and 
friends. They said I could come along and bring as many friends as I 
want!&quot;

&quot;Sounds awesome,&quot; Hero commented. &quot;Can ya count me in? I&#39;ve got nothing 
against my parents, but I barely know their friend, and I&#39;d just be out 
of place.&quot;

&quot;Sure, sure, you can come! And bring that awesome babe of a girlfriend 
with you!&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; she murmured, &quot;my girlfriend...&quot;

&quot;Well, that settles it,&quot; said Rai coolly, crossing her arms. &quot;Looks like 
I&#39;m tagging along as well. Somebody&#39;s gotta keep those Lu people in 
line. So that&#39;s four along with mom and dad Lu. I wonder if any of these 
beautiful stiffs wanna go as well.&quot; Frankly, the idea of staying at a 
summer home in another state&#151;perhaps close to the ocean&#151;was a dream for 
Ancelin, but she didn&#39;t speak up until later. The girls got into a 
debate about Ayanna Montgomery (as Hero had recently revealed how 
separated they now were), and it didn&#39;t seem like the right time. Class 
concluded slowly, with Mrs. Keys wishing all of them a happy vacation; 
she was later seen taking Alexandra and Corona to the side, possibly 
talking about sharing her own vacation with them.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Ancelin, bowing humbly. Ana, Hero, and Rai took notice 
of her and smiled; it was nearly impossible to not like the beautiful 
young woman. &quot;I overheard your conversation,&quot; she said, &quot;and I was 
wondering if it&#39;d be possible to take four more people with you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, four? Who do you have in mind?&quot;

&quot;My mother, her girlfriend, Ivory, and myself.&quot;

&quot;Ah, taking the whole family, huh?&quot; A look of joy, mixed with some 
mischief, was in Ana&#39;s eyes, and Ancelin was smart enough to understand 
what she really meant. But she feigned ignorance and nodded.

&quot;Not quite. Would it be inconvenient?&quot;

&quot;No, not at all. I&#39;ve been there before; it&#39;s a big place. Of course, 
some of us will have to share rooms, but I don&#39;t think any of us will 
mind!&quot; Hero chuckled&#151;the meaning behind that sentence was clear&#151;and 
Ancelin thanked her. There was of course a problem with transportation 
(not all of them could fit into one car), but Ancelin said her mother 
would be happy to drive one car.

&quot;Yee-haw!&quot; shouted Ana, snapping her fingers. &quot;That&#39;s what I want to 
hear! Road Trip! Road Trip! Road Trip! Woo-hoo!&quot; Rai chuckled nervously 
and tackled her girlfriend before she could make more of a fool of 
herself; Hero just kept silent. She could be as hyper as Ana sometimes, 
but not now. She did want Ayanna to come, but...would she agree? Would 
she even be interested, especially after what they had talked about?

SATURDAY

She agreed.

&quot;One, two, three, four, five, six,&quot; counted Ana as she read the names of 
the girls coming on the road trip. &quot;And the adults,&quot; she read, &quot;one, 
two, three, four. Hmm, a two-to-three ratio. Not too good if you&#39;re an 
adult, but I guess we were fortunate in this endeavor.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said Rai. They were arranged on Ana&#39;s bed, going 
over the last-minute details since they were all leaving early the next 
morning, and were both in a state of surprising undress; Ana had her 
head nestled comfortably on Rai&#39;s tummy.

&quot;Normally, adults want nothing more than to ruin our fun, boss us 
around, and be a general pain in the ass. A &#145;wet blanket&#39;, as they&#39;d say 
in England.&quot;

&quot;Here too,&quot; Rai noted. &quot;Though not as much.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but my parents are cool, and from what I hear, Mrs. Yi and Miss 
Fiske are all right as well. It&#39;s too bad Hero&#39;s parents couldn&#39;t come. 
Then it&#39;d be a party!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be stressful enough with you two pixies around, and let&#39;s not 
forget that Ayanna is of the same race. And Ivory is rather 
unpredictable.&quot;

&quot;So really it will be just you and Annie-kins acting as supervisors. 
Heh, here&#39;s hoping you don&#39;t dull everything up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to dull a thing,&quot; Rai argued coolly. &quot;I&#39;m as interested 
in this as you are. I just want to approach things with some rationale. 
Your suitcase was an awful mess before I came around and fixed it. What 
were you doing with all that junk in it anyway?&quot;

&quot;Hey, gimme a break here; I haven&#39;t been on a vacation in years. I am 
grateful for your help, but you don&#39;t have to act like a nag.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just helping you, kiddo.&quot; Ana stuck her tongue out and pounced, 
ready to wrestle Rai to the floor. There was no way she could win, but 
Rai certainly didn&#39;t mind losing if it meant being pinned, dominated, 
and fairly taken advantage of by this beautiful fairy. Ana did want to 
fool around, but she also wanted to prove she had some sense as well.

&quot;What the heck are you doing?&quot; she blurted suddenly, arms and hands 
latched securely around her lover&#39;s wrists. &quot;This is no time for games! 
We&#39;ve got to get organized! It&#39;s a good thing you have me here, Raisa 
Marie Zanders, or we&#39;d all be in a mess.&quot;

&quot;You know that&#39;s not my middle name,&quot; she replied. Ana beamed.

&quot;I know! But Marie sounds a lot better than Lanceten. What were your 
parents thinking, anyway?&quot; Rai gave off a sad smile and attempted to 
shrug, even though with Ana pressing down on her arms it was tough.

&quot;Honestly? I think they were both on dope.&quot;

SUNDAY

Hero was a chatty girl, but she was strangely quiet for the first hour 
or so on the road. Ancelin&#39;s mother and Ana&#39;s father were driving cars 
stuffed with suitcases and young women, and while the one car had plenty 
of chatty kids in it, the other was quiet. Ivory had blurted a storm at 
first, but now she was taking a nap (admittedly looking adorable with 
her head nestled on Ancelin&#39;s shoulder), and Ancelin was her usual mute 
self. Hero had wanted to say something to Ayanna, anything, but she was 
out of words. Besides, she had her own problems to deal with.

I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do. Is it my faith slipping, or my 
selfishness growing? I want to be with Ayanna, but I want to do what&#39;s 
right? Is being in love with another woman such a sin? I wouldn&#39;t be 
thrown into Hell for it, would I? It&#39;s no worse than stealing&#151;ugh, but 
thieves can reform; all manner of sinners can reform. But this is a sin 
of the heart&#151;and do I want to reform my heart? Oh, I love Ayanna, this 
is certain. I love her in ways I shouldn&#39;t love her; I want to be with 
her, be a part of her life, a part of her body! I want to become one 
with her; I know it&#39;s wrong, but...why? I&#39;d give anything to know what 
she&#39;s thinking.

Ayanna Montgomery was thinking how very nice it would be if they all 
stopped for some lunch.

They found a good diner several miles down the road and stopped to eat 
(they wanted to stretch their legs, but how possible was that in a 
diner?). They all sat together in one big table and for the longest time 
had a great conversation, mainly focused on getting to know each other. 
Ana&#39;s parents and Ancelin&#39;s mother had met briefly in several 
parent-teacher conferences, but this was their first real social event 
together, and they jabbered a storm. Ivory had declared a French Fry war 
with Ana and was fighting to the death over some silly manner (they used 
ketchup as blood, of course); Rai and Ancelin stared at each other 
quietly, knowing smiles gracing their lips.

&quot;Our girlfriends,&quot; they seemed to say, &quot;certainly know how to brighten 
things up.&quot; Hero sat directly across from Ayanna, whether by intent or 
accident, and at first they kept their silence. They didn&#39;t even speak 
until they had ordered, and tried ignoring everyone else.

&quot;...How&#39;s the girlfriend?&quot; blurted Love, unfortunately the only thing 
she could think of. Ayanna gave her a placid, if not bored look.

&quot;Oh, you know. Exciting and dull. She&#39;s pretty, but about as smart as 
printing paper.&quot;

&quot;...Oh. You gonna stay with her?&quot;

&quot;Mm, not long. She&#39;s nice, but a bit...not there, if you know what I 
mean. What about you?&quot;

&quot;I...don&#39;t think you wanna know.&quot;

&quot;No, go on, tell me. Now I&#39;m interested.&quot;

&quot;My intent all along,&quot; she muttered under her breath. She gave a 
charming grin, glinting her eyes just so as she oozed out a romantic 
line she had wanted to use for ages: &quot;Frankly, you&#39;re the only one for 
me.&quot;

&quot;Gee,&quot; Ayanna countered after some thought, &quot;that doesn&#39;t sound like 
you. And here I thought you didn&#39;t want to be gay&#151;or excuse me, bi.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not saying I am, not for any of them. I just...look, it&#39;s tough for 
me, but I want to be with you. I know I&#39;m just contradicting myself, but 
I think back then I was only lying. Back then I wanted to do what was 
right, or at least what I thought was right. But now I&#39;m not even sure 
what that is anymore.&quot;

&quot;So it was right of you to break up with me?&quot;

&quot;To be honest, I think it was damn stupid of me to do it.&quot; Ayanna 
couldn&#39;t help but smile, and secretly reached under the table to take 
Hero&#39;s hand. Oh, that felt good, and it brought back so many wonderful 
memories!

&quot;Yeah, it was. So you feel awful?&quot;

&quot;Actually, I really feel worse every day, and not just cuz&#39; of that, but 
because I&#39;m really starting to question things. Up until now I&#39;ve been 
pretty much on the level with God, but...things have transpired that 
made me really doubt Him.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really, do tell,&quot; she insisted. Hero sighed glumly.

&quot;It&#39;s just the whole matter of not being able to fall in love with other 
girls&#151;you know, homosexuality and stuff. I&#39;ve tried justifying it by 
myself, but I never get anywhere. To be honest, I want so badly to be 
back with you, because I do love you&#151;but I have duties to God, even 
though now I&#39;m getting muddled again.&quot;

&quot;...I see,&quot; was all she could manage to say. The others weren&#39;t 
listening in, or if they were, they paid them no mind. Then, &quot;Look, I 
said I admired your devotion, and I was telling the truth. It was one of 
your best qualities. But I also like your honesty, and the fact that now 
you&#39;re struggling. Makes me feel a little better knowing I&#39;m not the 
only one wrestling with this. It&#39;s a relief.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; said Hero with a smile.

&quot;I actually asked several ministers about it,&quot; Ayanna continued, a 
little flustered now. &quot;Men and women,&quot; she added. &quot;A lot really took me 
off guard. They didn&#39;t even bring out the fire-and-brimstone when I told 
them I was gay. Some of them even fired back with worse things, like 
adultery, thoughts of murder, theft, drugs, the whole deal. One guy said 
that if God can forgive theft, murder, and deceit, He can forgive 
anything. That definitely made me feel better. And there&#39;s another 
thing.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;...One really wise man, this guy named Doug or something, said that the 
things stated in the Old Testament part of the Bible didn&#39;t always hold 
true with the New Testament, or even the modern era&#151;like what animals to 
eat and how to govern and hold court, that sort of thing. In other 
words, times change and laws do too. He told me there may yet be hope 
for my, uh, cause&#151;so you can imagine I was a little more comfortable 
with this whole thing. I dunno, maybe he was just saying something to 
placate me.&quot; She got a long drink of water since she had been talking so 
much, leaving Hero to smile sweetly.

&quot;Oh. So...you&#39;re a little more at peace now with God.&quot;

&quot;Just a wee bit,&quot; she said, pinching her fingers together to indicate 
the amount. &quot;I still don&#39;t like some parts of the religion, and part of 
me still thinks that God is just a crazy lunatic who doesn&#39;t know what 
the hell He&#39;s doing. And I still hate it when these idiotic 
Bible-thumpers run after me telling me I&#39;ll go to Hell if I fornicate 
with women. Ugh!&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; said Hero, smiling broader. &quot;The best thing to 
do in that situation is either ignore them or ask them what sins they&#39;ve 
committed recently. You know, whoever&#39;s without sin must cast the first 
stone, that sort of thing. That usually shuts them up. Anyway, I&#39;m sorry 
I messed things up, but do you suppose we still have a chance at being a 
couple?&quot;

&quot;Mm, maybe,&quot; she teased her. They didn&#39;t talk about it any more for 
awhile, but there was definitely some improvement in their relationship, 
and their barriers had been eroded. As for the French Fry war, Ivory 
won.

MONDAY

Everyone arrived at the summer home so late the other night that they 
didn&#39;t have time for anything except to dress in their sleeping wear and 
fall into bed. There were a grand total of three bathrooms in the whole 
place, each with their own shower, and four rooms which everyone could 
share with somebody else. This left two people out, but Ana&#39;s parents 
said they&#39;d be happy sleeping on the fold-out couch in the den, provided 
nobody came in there until after 9:00 every morning (easier said than 
done). That first morning, nobody was in danger of disturbing anybody as 
they were too tired, but during the week several awkward &quot;incidents&quot; 
made the trip more...interesting.

For a brief moment, Ivory wondered if this would be the week when she 
would finally go &quot;all the way&quot; with Ancelin, but the goodness that had 
built up in her heart told her to push that thought aside. Ancelin was 
too fine and sweet to be rushed into that sort of thing, and besides, 
she was plenty content to spend her time like a real girlfriend and not 
a one night stand. They woke up together but did not share a shower, 
even though to be honest, they both wanted to. Ivory let her go first 
and went to the kitchen to make breakfast, but inadvertently stumbled 
into the den. It was 8:43 am.

Ana and Rai showered together, as they were now in the habit of doing. 
Ana was usually the aggressor in their relationship&#151;Rai didn&#39;t want to 
come across as pushy, and besides, she liked being dominated by the 
beautiful blonde fairy&#151;but that morning she was in control, throwing 
clothes to the floor in a frenzy and carrying the squealing, naked 
little Ana into the stall so they could wash up. Their antics could be 
heard outside the bathroom, all the way to the den, but the &quot;Lusome 
twosome&quot; showed no objection to their daughter being sexually pleasured 
by another woman, masculine though she was.

Ivory made a fair meal with the help of Madeline and Kiki, but everyone 
had to have rations since there wasn&#39;t enough food to go around. It was 
decided that half the team would split up to do grocery shopping, while 
the other half set about cleaning, and at first nobody wanted to do 
either since they didn&#39;t sound very exciting. In the end, since they 
technically owned the house, Ana&#39;s parents stayed behind with their 
daughter, Rai, and Hero, while everyone else went shopping. Hero wanted 
a moment alone with Ayanna, but she would have the rest of the day for 
that.

Cleaning her girlfriend&#39;s summer house was not what Rai had in mind for 
Spring Break, but at least Ana was there to make things go by faster. 
She looked so cute washing the windows, especially when she bent down 
just a little to get the lower parts. And she was so thorough and 
attentive, too (of course, Rai only thought these traits applied to 
their...evening affairs). She recklessly pursued stains and swept the 
floor, both with mop and broom, twice. They didn&#39;t say much to each 
other while cleaning, but there was a radio on and so time moved a 
little quicker.

The others arrived from shopping an hour later, and since they had been 
running around having fun in a nice local store, it was their duty to 
make lunch (the others got a well-deserved break). Hero popped in and 
offered to help, even though her ulterior motive was to get a moment 
alone with Ayanna. She was promptly scooted out by Ancelin&#39;s mother, 
told to relax, and that was the end of it.

Since so many of the girls hadn&#39;t been to the beach or even swam in 
years, it was decided they&#39;d go to the beach for the day, and packed a 
light supper along with everything else. Ivory was alone in her room 
trying to squeeze into her old swimsuit, and quickly resolved to get a 
new one when she discovered several embarrassing rips and tears in the 
fabric. While fretting about her condition, and wondering if she could 
borrow/swipe someone else&#39;s, the pervert in her couldn&#39;t help but look 
around the house and see if anybody else was dressing...or undressing.

To her disappointment, Ancelin still hadn&#39;t even taken her shirt off. 
Ana and Rai were more or less in between, though they were delayed by 
their hormones and several bouts of &quot;playful wrestling&quot;. Madeline and 
Kiki (Ivory couldn&#39;t help but be a little attracted to them both) were 
fully covered with nice, sensible, sexy one-pieces; Ayanna had an 
eye-popping bikini, but poor Hero had forgotten her suit entirely.

&quot;No big deal,&quot; Ivory told her when she learned the news. &quot;Mine&#39;s all 
ripped up anyway. We could just get new ones later.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but you know they&#39;ll cost an arm and a leg. I guess it&#39;s for the 
best, though, since I&#39;m not a swimmer.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Well you don&#39;t just swim at the beach, Love. You need a tan anyway; 
why not just take a towel and cover what may?&quot;

&quot;Because I&#39;m not an exhibitionist.&quot;

&quot;Oh, lighten up,&quot; said Ivory with a laugh. &quot;I thought you were cool, 
Hero.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, I&#39;m my own definition of cool, and I say I won&#39;t expose my 
naked back or butt to the world.&quot; Ivory made a face, called Hero boring, 
and made herself scarce by going up and asking the adults if she could 
run out and buy a new swimsuit&#151;preferably something that would catch 
Ancelin&#39;s eye. It was Madeline Yi who helped her out, giving the younger 
girl a sly smile as she took her to the nearest store. Now at first even 
Ivory was embarrassed about buying a revealing bikini (or two) with her 
own girlfriend&#39;s mother present, but Madeline was so helpful and 
sincere&#151;&quot;This would look good on you,&quot; she&#39;d say, or, &quot;I really think 
Ancelin will like this,&quot; that soon Ivory felt like she was with a cool 
aunt and not the mother of her love interest.

TUESDAY

The beach on Monday was disappointingly crowded, and dark clouds came up 
before anybody had any real fun. That night, Ivory wanted to press the 
issue of sex to her girlfriend, but knew it would only be received in 
the same way. She would have to be content with being held by Ancelin, 
being touched and caressed by those hands, being kissed and stared at, 
and fondled every so often by a &quot;slip&quot; of her hands (or tongue). There 
was no question that Ancelin was becoming a very sexual creature, and 
longed to have Ivory in her grasp, but she felt it wasn&#39;t the right 
time.

Of course, Ana and Rai were past all that, and frankly screwed each 
other like lovesick rabbits who just found out they would die the 
following day. This didn&#39;t happen every day, of course: sometimes Ana Lu 
was so exhausted (&quot;Her sugar supply&#39;s gone dry,&quot; Rai was prone to 
remark) that she just fell into bed and wouldn&#39;t move to save her own 
life. Other times she wasn&#39;t in the mood, annoyed at something, or else 
just plain unresponsive. And that Tuesday morning, it was Rai herself 
who refused, saying she wanted to just sleep, sleep, sleep without any 
concerns. Besides, she wasn&#39;t a sex fiend, and there was more to life 
than humping.

Sex aside, Tuesday was spent indoors since a terrible rain befell the 
beaches. Even Hero was not crazy enough to venture outside and get 
soaked. It would be, as she described it, &quot;like walking into a hovering 
pool&quot;. The Lu family braved the elements and dashed out to rent a 
handful of movies, and everyone spent the day in front of one film or 
another, usually snuggled with their significant other. During a break 
in the lull, Ayanna pulled Hero aside to the room they shared and locked 
the door. It was good that the last film they saw was a comedy, because 
it put them both in good spirits.

&quot;I&#39;m thinking now&#39;s a good time for us to talk,&quot; she began peacefully 
enough. Hero agreed.

&quot;Yeah, we haven&#39;t gotten a moment together since we got here. So you 
enjoying yourself?&quot;

&quot;Mm, I guess. I wanted to go swimming some more.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, not me. I sink like a rock.&quot;

&quot;Oh, nonsense, you can learn how to swim easy! Are you afraid of the 
water, or can you just not swim?&quot;

&quot;Um...I really can&#39;t swim. I&#39;m not scared or anything, I&#39;m just not like 
half of a dolphin or something.&quot;

&quot;Well I can teach you.&quot; Hero half-smiled.

&quot;I&#39;d like that. Anyway, I just, uh...wanna talk to you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I figured, and so did I. Mainly about our relationship. Hero,&quot; 
she said, very serious now, &quot;tell me the truth. Are you in love with 
me?&quot;

&quot;Without a doubt in the world,&quot; answered she, quietly.

&quot;Did you ever fall out of love with me?&quot; A cold pause.

&quot;I...wanted to, I admit, but I couldn&#39;t. It was like quitting a 
wonderful drug cold turkey. One day I just out and cried, knowing I had 
to be honest with myself. Saying I shouldn&#39;t be with you is an outright 
lie; I want to, so badly, and I don&#39;t care what anyone else thinks. It 
can&#39;t be a sin. It can&#39;t be. I love you too much for it to be wrong. I 
love you, Ayanna, and I&#39;ll say it as many times as I can.&quot; She grinned 
in spite of the mist in her eyes. &quot;Wanna know something funny?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Even when I wasn&#39;t with you, people still thought I was gay. I ended up 
saying to myself...&#145;Self! If people are going to think you&#39;re a lesbian, 
or bisexual, or whatever, then you may as well try and find some 
happiness with it&#151;and who makes you happier than Ayanna Montgomery?&#39; Of 
course, all this was over a long period of time, and I near well 
tortured myself with all these thoughts. But I&#39;m thinking clearly now, I 
swear.&quot;

&quot;You certainly sound like it,&quot; said Ayanna. She stood up and did what 
she had wanted to do for a long time; she put her arms around her 
beloved Hero and squeezed, wanting to feel that warm body up next to her 
again. Hero had broken her heart a little, yes, but she could forgive 
the foolish fairy, because she was being honest with herself now.

&quot;What&#39;s the point in ignoring the plain truth?&quot; said Ayanna, looking 
directly into her beauty&#39;s face. &quot;I can&#39;t resist you, no matter how hard 
I try and shove you out of my life. You are...everything I want, Hero 
Love. Everything.&quot;

They kissed, together, as one. And stayed like that, quietly loving, for 
such a long time that the others started wondering where they were.

Finally, Mrs. Lu poked her head inside the door to their room and jerked 
with an embarrassed chuckle as she spotted the two fairies enamored with 
each other. They noticed her and grinned sheepishly, but she just 
winked, told them how happy she was they were back together again (and 
so cute, too!) and left them to resume their...activities. This might 
not have been a good idea in the long run, for nobody saw hide or hair 
of either girl until the next morning, and God only knew what they were 
doing until then.

WEDNESDAY

The two fairies, or princesses, or whatever they were calling themselves 
now, woke up in each other&#39;s arms: not quite naked, yet not quite 
dressed. They smiled and sighed as morning stiffness overcame their 
limbs, and shared several weak kisses before pulling themselves out of 
the sheets. Ayanna, her skin bronze and her hair dyed red, looked like a 
goddess in her white clothes, and Hero was worth staring at as well, 
especially with the cute mat of yellowy hair that was hanging over her 
eyes. The two girls giggled at each other and went for a far, far deeper 
embrace than before. What stopped them from making out right then and 
there was toothpaste&#151;or a lack of it, anyway.

They fixed this by sharing mirror space in one of the three bathrooms, 
each scrubbing her mouth with a toothbrush. After spitting, they both 
tried kissing again, and found the experience much more pleasant.

&quot;Mm, minty!&quot; purred Hero. They laughed and kissed again, sharing smiles 
and a slightly serious expression. &quot;So are we an item again?&quot; asked Love 
shyly. Ayanna beamed happily.

&quot;Yes, we&#39;re definitely an item.&quot;

&quot;All right! That&#39;s good.&quot; She inhaled her new girlfriend&#39;s scent, 
burying her face in the crook of Montgomery&#39;s neck. Chills and a rush, 
an avalanche, ran down all nervous system highways in Ayanna&#39;s body and 
eroded her psyche like only the touch of a heroic lover could. She took 
Hero&#39;s fingers into her own; they were so beautiful together!

&quot;Hero,&quot; she said, looking her girlfriend in the eye when she could, &quot;I 
want to say something very sweet to you.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Go ahead.&quot;

&quot;...I would be deeply in love with you even if you didn&#39;t dye your hair 
blonde.&quot; The words did not have the affect Ayanna was hoping for, 
because Hero just stood there looking puzzled. After awhile, she just 
said &quot;Oh&quot;, and smiled. &quot;No, you don&#39;t get it,&quot; Ayanna continued; &quot;I&#39;m 
like Mira the Dike, obsessed with blondes&#151;especially those tall leggy 
ones with great flowing hair, and Daryl Hannah...&quot; She sighed greedily 
and nuzzled Hero&#39;s face with her nose, but came back from her dreamy 
stupor before long, and grinned. &quot;But you&#39;re much better than her,&quot; she 
concluded, and this time the words struck true.

Hero grinned lovingly and put her arms all the way around her 
girlfriend&#39;s body, pressing their mouths together much as their own 
bodies were pushed. They stayed kissing one another for a timeless age, 
long enough for their bodies to wake totally from sleep and into 
hormone-driven starvation, the need for sex and lust and each other. 
Ayanna erupted with passion as Hero&#39;s tongue invited itself into her 
mouth and caressed...oh, for eons and eons, driving her madder and 
madder with every passing second, every touch, every loving stroke. And 
then, when they concluded and came up for air, a glint of foreign desire 
was in the young woman&#39;s eye, and breathlessly she spoke the words that 
Ayanna had been aching to hear.

&quot;Let&#39;s take a shower...together.&quot;

The moment required a pause to register the improbability of it all. To 
appreciate it, one had to remember that Hero was a church girl, and 
(once upon a time) had been bisexual, at best, merely dabbling with 
other girls here and there. She was fun-loving, sure, but hardly so 
adventurous or &quot;driven&quot;. Ayanna&#39;s elation was expected; she grinned back 
with just as much wanting and glee, not quite sure she had heard those 
very words.

&quot;Y-you sure? You want to?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Hero whispered, &quot;let&#39;s do it.&quot; Another pause&#151;Ayanna struggled to 
remove herself from Hero&#39;s grip so she could undress.

&quot;I&#39;m game!&quot; she exclaimed, perhaps too hasty for her own good. But their 
actions could be forgiven, and nobody would look down on them if they 
chose not to avert their eyes, but to stare hungrily as each other&#39;s 
flesh, copper-tones and pale pink, respectively, bared itself for the 
other. It was honestly the first time they had seen each one another.

Now the mechanics of two hopelessly horny teenage girls, just recently 
rekindling their desire and love for each other, could not (and should 
not, really) be mentioned outside of barest description, but for these 
two an exception was made (meanwhile, coincidentally, Rai and Ana were 
also sharing a shower and so were Kiki and Madeline; Ancelin and Ivory 
took theirs separately). The whole thing really got started when Hero 
turned the faucet and showerhead on, which gave Ayanna an incredibly 
good excuse to reach out, caress, then firmly slap the voluptuous rear 
end of her girlfriend. It was then only fair that Hero did the same.

Somehow the two managed to remember they were supposed to be in the 
shower in order to use it. They stepped in and at first it was pleasure 
before business. It&#39;s not every day you see the woman you love, 
beautiful by all means, standing naked and happy before you, sprayed by 
water above and perfectly willing to give herself over to you. Ayanna 
badly wanted to squeeze Hero&#39;s breasts (which were impressively larger 
than hers and sagging just a bit), while Hero, every religious duty now 
out the window, stared very hard at the naked womanhood of her Ayanna, 
and the sensual shape placed vertically in the very center. She had 
never seen another woman&#39;s genitals up so close, except for her own, and 
would&#39;ve stood there staring for hours if Ayanna hadn&#39;t come to her 
senses.

&quot;We&#39;d better hurry before it gets cold,&quot; she said sheepishly. &quot;After 
all, we&#39;re not the only ones in the house.&quot;

&quot;Pity; I&#39;d like to streak around nekked with you.&quot; The two squealed and 
Ayanna playfully slapped Hero several times for her raunchy remark. Her 
hands touched those ovular breasts, accidentally at first but then by 
intention, and stayed there as if their body parts were magnetized. The 
soothing sound coming from Hero&#39;s throat told Ayanna she was by no means 
against this contact.

&quot;They&#39;re so sexy,&quot; she whispered lustfully, taking a few slippery steps 
closer so she could fully appreciate her Hero&#39;s endowment. Both hands 
now went to her bosom, and performed such light, tender, gradual motions 
that it actually had a greater effect than if Ayanna had gone and 
assaulted her. Hero drew her beloved closer, eyes clouded with unnatural 
lust, and placed her hands upon the mammary glands of another woman for 
the first time. There were some fireworks.

They evolved from touching to rubbing the four orbs together; they drew 
so close and began to suck face so heedlessly (what other expression 
could explain it?) that their breasts not only touched, but ground 
together, sometimes causing pleasant pain. Hero felt her hips come into 
contact with Ayanna&#39;s, and ever bit of sense she had was lost. She 
wanted to grind and make love to this angel, to fuck her&#151;yes, fuck 
her&#151;senselessly, for weeks and months on end, to become one with her 
until they were both of one mind, one heart, one soul, and maybe even 
one body. She started by reaching out and squeezing Ayanna&#39;s rear end 
with both hands.

&quot;I want you,&quot; she practically barked. &quot;I want you so badly. Ayanna...I 
want to make love to you.&quot; This stopped their session cold. Ayanna froze 
and looked dead into Hero&#39;s eyes, suddenly frightened by their 
seriousness. She stopped and backed away, managing to breathe.

&quot;Whoa, okay, going too fast.&quot;

&quot;What, we are? But I want this, babe. I&#39;m really ready. I&#39;m ready, I 
swear! I want this!&quot;

&quot;...No,&quot; she insisted, &quot;it isn&#39;t right. This isn&#39;t you talking, it&#39;s 
just your hormones. It&#39;s just lust, Hero; just let it go away. Please, 
you don&#39;t really want this. Think it through.&quot; Now it wasn&#39;t as if 
Ayanna didn&#39;t want sex as well&#151;oh boy, did she ever!!&#151;but she knew her 
Love better than that, and she knew that her Love didn&#39;t really mean any 
of that. She still had morals and she still had a promise she had made 
to herself. Even if Ayanna was going to be the person she would spend 
the rest of her life with, they couldn&#39;t possibly be ready for that 
final level yet. They just couldn&#39;t.

All this and more went through Hero&#39;s mind and stabbed her like icy 
daggers (helped in part by the water, which was quite cool now). She 
took a moment and came to her senses, then realized, as if waking from a 
dream, she and Ayanna were both completely nude and sharing a small, 
cramped, wet shower space together. She let out a steamy sigh of regret 
and almost collapsed against the tiled wall.

&quot;God,&quot; she uttered raggedly, &quot;I almost blew it. I really almost blew it, 
didn&#39;t I? Ha! Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever do this. I don&#39;t know what came over 
me. There, see?&quot; she said, smiling sadly at her beauty. &quot;I&#39;m not better 
than anyone or holier than thou. I slip up too. I have wants and needs 
too. I&#39;m sure even the minister&#39;s daughter masturbates, and thinks of 
boys screwing her&#151;or girls for all I know. This just proves that the 
people you think are really great are really not. God, I&#39;m sorry 
Ayanna.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, sweetie,&quot; she said comfortably, touching Hero&#39;s soaked 
shoulder. &quot;I would&#39;ve done the same thing. Oh wait&#151;I almost did. Ha!&quot; 
Hero chuckled and stood up, but didn&#39;t want to hug Ayanna and start that 
all over again. They didn&#39;t really know what to say to each other, so 
they held hands and pressed their noses together.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Love. &quot;Thanks for bringing me to my senses. I&#39;m glad one 
of us still has some.&quot;

&quot;Well, I owed you for all those times you looked out for me. I guess you 
rubbed off on me...in more ways than one.&quot; They shared another chuckle 
and then, a kiss, then quickly showered for real before the water 
started to get really cold. They didn&#39;t tell anybody what happened, 
although Olivia probably guessed something was up once her cousin came 
back. As for the matter of Ayanna&#39;s &quot;other&quot; girlfriend...

&quot;No loss on my part,&quot; she groused sometime later, fully dressed and 
reclining on their bed. &quot;It&#39;s over between us. She was an okay lady, but 
definitely not my type. She was just not you, Hero.&quot;

&quot;Oh. That&#39;s good to know.&quot;

THURSDAY

Most of Wednesday was spent sightseeing, but considering how long some 
people took to get out of the shower or bed, the day was quite busy. 
That evening the troupe returned the videos and went to see a play, and 
surprisingly nobody started necking, because it never ended up being 
dull (Rai liked it the best). For supper, two great pizzas were ordered 
and the whole team got into a spirited conversation&#151;spirited probably 
because, with Hero and Ayanna in love with each other again, everything 
seemed much brighter and jovial.

Thursday was spent on the beach. It was a right proper day to go, even 
though it was still crowded. There wasn&#39;t a cloud in the sky, so there 
was no threat of bad weather at all. At first only a few people went in 
the ocean&#151;Ana, Ayanna, and Ancelin said they didn&#39;t need tans and ran 
out to swim&#151;but soon their respective love interests chased after them, 
and the six girls ended up having a huge sea-war with water bombs and 
kamikaze dunking and races and huge splashes and snappers (where one 
naughty woman snapped the back of another woman&#39;s bikini) and all kinds 
of general mayhem.

When it was all over, Rai hoisted Ana in her arms and carried her 
squealing and laughing back to dry land, where she was deposited right 
in front of her parents, who set about burying their daughter in the 
sand (Rai helped). Hero and Ayanna took to a walk-and-talk, holding 
hands and receiving several flirtatious calls along the way. But Ancelin 
and Ivory stayed in the water, talking peacefully and quietly.

&quot;So what&#39;cha think about all that?&quot; said Ivory, indicating their 
traveling companions. Ancelin smiled.

&quot;It&#39;s great to go out with them. I really think we could all be good 
friends when we get back to school, especially Rai and myself. She seems 
to be just the kind of person I would want to be with. And then there&#39;s 
you, of course!&quot;

&quot;Oh, how nice of you to mention me!&quot; she exclaimed, sounding faintly 
sarcastic but otherwise happy. &quot;As for me, I&#39;ve really enjoyed hanging 
with your mom and Kiki. I just cannot stop telling you how utterly cool 
they are! I swear, if my dad and your mom ever got in the same room 
together, it&#39;d be a ball.&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t told me much about your family,&quot; Ancelin said. Ivory 
groaned.

&quot;Oh, what&#39;s to tell? My mother is a bitch and my father is some witless 
vagabond. I&#39;ve...been told I take after him. Guess I should be glad I 
don&#39;t take over my mother. God, I just...hate that woman!&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nearly the same reason you hate your dad,&quot; she said. Ancelin 
became very silent and withdrawn, but Ivory knew what she was talking 
about. At last she sighed and spoke up.

&quot;Our parents. One we love, another we detest, but at least your mother 
didn&#39;t abuse you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, she did. It&#39;s not like she hit me or anything, it&#39;s just...other 
ways. And I gotta live with the bitch while my stupid bastard of a dad 
runs around in...Tanzania or Mongolia or Belgium, or wherever the hell 
he is now! So...you&#39;ll excuse me if I look like I&#39;m real clingy around 
your mom.&quot; Ancelin was a little taken aback to see Ivory crying, and it 
was clear she was trying very hard not to. Ivory rarely cried or showed 
this serious side of hers, but to Ancelin it was beautiful and precious, 
something to take and nurture, and to love. She waded forward and placed 
her hands on Ivory&#39;s cheeks, gently moving her fingers over her skin as 
their eyes met and a deep, new understanding was reached.

&quot;It&#39;s all right, dear-heart,&quot; said Ancelin as she kissed her beloved. 
&quot;You can stay with my mother as much as you want. She and I both love 
you so much...&quot;

&quot;Annie...!&quot; With that little wail she fell apart, plunging herself into 
Ancelin&#39;s arms, where their lips touched and their souls became as one. 
They sunk underneath the waves and continued their embrace, Ancelin&#39;s 
magnificent russet hair waving above like rich seaweed. Ivory&#39;s hands 
couldn&#39;t help but reach out and touch her girlfriend&#39;s breasts, but she 
quickly realized what she was doing and pulled away. They surfaced, 
gasping a little, but Ancelin had a forgiving smile on her face, and 
took Ivory into her heart once again before the other woman could speak. 
Then Ivory felt what she least expected: a gentle hand softly cupping 
her own bosom. Ancelin was copping a feel!

&quot;God,&quot; she giggled once their kiss ended, &quot;if I didn&#39;t know any better, 
I&#39;d say you were horny, Annie-kins!&quot;

&quot;Oh, just a wee bit!&quot; she squealed&#151;another rare trait of hers. Ivory 
blushed, and for the first time in her life (maybe), she actually backed 
out of a sexual situation.

&quot;Umm...l-let&#39;s go see what your mom&#39;s up to. Betcha a million bucks 
she&#39;s giving that lover of hers a massage!&quot; Ancelin giggled and followed 
Ivory, and allowed her eyes to fully gaze on the naked skin of her 
sweetheart as she emerged from the water, dripping wet. She didn&#39;t want 
to blush or become embarrassed, because this was Ivory, the woman she 
was in love with, and she wanted to be drawn to her. Quietly, subtly, as 
they both surfaced onto the crumbly sand, Ancelin flashed Ivory a look 
of unquestionable lust and patted her behind gently before taking her 
hand.

Ivory was very happy for the rest of the day.

That night, when all the young and young at heart were in bed, Madeline 
and Kiki explored the lonely beach together, holding hands beneath a 
smiling crescent moon. The only sound was the music of waves, coming in 
and going out slowly, some reaching to their bare feet. A long, long 
trail of sandy footprints showed where they had been; before them was 
emptiness, their future together, so full of possibilities. No symbolism 
crossed their minds, for they were too absorbed in the simple aesthetic 
value of the moment, and each other. It was quite awhile before either 
of them spoke.

&quot;Madeline?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been...speaking with Ancelin about a few things, mainly asking her 
what she thinks of me. She&#39;s really grown fond of me, which is good. I 
was afraid for a moment that she&#39;d be distant somehow.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said her lover with a smile, &quot;if you had met her a year earlier, 
she might have been. I think being around Ivory has really opened her 
up, in more ways than one. Did you see the way they were flirting with 
each other earlier on?&quot;

&quot;Like a couple of kids,&quot; Kiki said with a giggle. &quot;But anyway, I am glad 
she&#39;s more receptive now. If she wasn&#39;t, I would not be able to stand 
here and ask you the question I&#39;ve been meaning to say for awhile now.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; And the heart of Madeline Yi leaped forth with a wild 
hope as Kiki Fiske, new love of her life, knelt down on one knee and 
took her hand.

&quot;Madeline, will you be mine forever, and do me the honor of being your 
wife?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Kiki!!&quot; Too happy to speak, Madeline crumbled and embraced the 
other woman, fighting to say yes, yes, &quot;Yes! Of course I&#39;ll marry you! 
Oh, Kiki! I...love you so much!!&quot;

&quot;I love you too,&quot; said she through tears. &quot;And I was...a little 
concerned, because of this, but when I told Ancelin what I was going to 
do, she looked just as happy as you are now! The resemblance is 
uncanny!&quot;

&quot;Of course it is, nitwit!&quot; said Madeline, pressing their noses together. 
They grinned, kissing each other until the waves splashed round them and 
they remembered where they were. When they had the courage to speak 
softly instead of screaming for bliss, they held each other, knowing 
that this was now the person they would live with and love for ever. 
&quot;You are going to make such a wonderful stepmother,&quot; Madeline whispered. 
Kiki sighed happily.

&quot;I hope so. She deserves the best. You both do.&quot;

&quot;Mm, well, that&#39;s easily taken care of...&quot; Kiki giggled as her lover, 
her fianc&eacute;e, kissed her neck, bringing her in and out of wonderful 
spasms until they could no longer bear it, and made love right there in 
the sand. But they were not the only ones out that night; Ana and Rai 
patrolled the shores as well, though their engagement was an entirely 
different sort. They merely wanted to take a moonlit walk, maybe steal a 
glimpse of the sunset if they could, or else watch the stars and the 
waves if they could not. It would&#39;ve been disaster if the two pairs of 
women had came into contact, but by sheer good fortune, the footprints 
of both couples traveled along different paths, so nobody knew what 
happened that night save those involved.

FRIDAY

Raisa Zanders, called Raisa Marie by her girlfriend, was frankly sick 
and tired of staying inside all the time. Not even the beach sparked her 
interest anymore, and though she loved Ana deeply, she wanted to spend 
some time away from her (and the Lu family itself in general; Ana&#39;s 
parents sort of freaked her out). But since it wasn&#39;t like her to just 
up and run off, she was polite enough to tell Ana of her plans, though 
it took some convincing to pry the little fairy away. Rai borrowed Mr. 
Lu&#39;s car and drove it to an arts and music gallery she had heard about, 
thinking it&#39;d be best to end the week with style.

The place certainly did not disappoint. She arrived just in time to hear 
a live performance of several Rachmaninov pieces, and spoke to the 
player once she had a break. She wasn&#39;t surprised to find the pianist 
was a lady, but the lady was surprised to find that Rai was also an 
accomplished musician, albeit amateur. After all, at first glance, who 
would think that tall, dark-haired, handsome Rai was into the arts? She 
had to prove to the woman that she knew her stuff, and played Rossini 
until the older girl was satisfied.

&quot;You&#39;re quite skilled,&quot; she admitted humbly. &quot;You&#39;re a truer aficionada 
than I am. What&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Rai,&quot; she said gruffly&#151;then decided to say more than just that. &quot;Raisa, 
I mean. Raisa L...Marie Zanders.&quot; Oh wow, Ana was right! It did sound 
better. The other woman smiled and took her hand, though her grip was 
not good.

&quot;I&#39;m Shaylee Travis. I guess we both have exotic names.&quot; Rai just 
shrugged, then Shaylee offered to buy her some coffee from the local 
shop. &quot;Don&#39;t worry!&quot; she assured her new friend. &quot;It&#39;s not the evil 
empire known as Starbucks! It&#39;s a small place, family-owned. You drink 
real coffee there.&quot; Rai honestly didn&#39;t care: Shaylee had caught her 
with the word coffee the minute she spoke. Her promise actually 
underscored the flavor of the drink, and once Rai got a few sips in, she 
knew where that five dollars and forty-one cents were going.

&quot;So how&#39;d you get to be such a good ivory tickler?&quot; asked Shaylee. Rai 
only blushed a little; one of her companions on this trip was named 
Ivory.

&quot;My...mother made me at first. I kept going because I didn&#39;t want people 
to think I was an uncivilized barbarian. If you walk around looking like 
me,&quot; she said, indicating her masculine build, &quot;people tend to think 
stereotypical thoughts. Of course, I&#39;m partially to blame, seeing as how 
I dress this way, but I can&#39;t stand feminine clothes.&quot; Rai also didn&#39;t 
know why she was opening up to Shaylee like this. She had never been 
this revealing before, not in a first encounter anyway, and she was 
surprised how easily the words came out. But Rai didn&#39;t stop: she spoke 
until the coffee was gone and her throat was dry. Shaylee sucked it all 
in and had a smile to show for it.

&quot;Well that&#39;s a fine story. I&#39;d love to stay and chat more,&quot; she said, 
taking a glance at her watch, &quot;but I&#39;ve got another performance coming 
up. As a fellow artist, I&#39;m sure you know how important it is to take 
gigs wherever you can find them, even if it&#39;s wearing a dress and 
playing piano for artsy people. No offense!&quot;

&quot;None taken,&quot; said Rai, a bit glum to see Miss Travis go. She waved 
goodbye, feeling like she had made a good friend, even though the two 
would probably never meet again. Although Rai felt tempted to go back 
and listen to the lady&#39;s concert, she wanted to see the rest of the 
gallery first. A woman dressed like her was a rare thing in that area, 
so she wanted to soak it all in. Idly she noticed that the place had an 
internet caf&eacute;, and kept that in mind while she wandered around, letting 
her mind take control.

When she had had enough of the art (Lippi and Botticelli always left her 
exhausted), she wandered into the internet caf&eacute;, paid for an hour of 
service, and checked her email. Most of it was nonsense, or reminders 
she had mailed herself (some, admittedly, she had forgotten about), or 
the occasional love letter from Ana. What a sweet girl! Rai printed 
every one of them out and kept them together, then noticed a new letter 
from somebody who evoked quite a few memories of the past. She actually 
gasped as she read the letter.

&quot;So how&#39;s my favorite Yank? Do you KNOW how long it&#39;s been since we&#39;ve 
spoken? You SAID you&#39;d email me, but I think you must&#39;ve forgotten. 
Don&#39;t tell me you LOST my address, or I&#39;ll have to smack your bum! 
Forget what I said; how are you, my dear? I&#39;ve been having a rather 
uneventful life&#151;if what you call a stint in the military uneventful!&#151;and 
I couldn&#39;t help but think of you. Do tell me what&#39;s become of you, or I 
shall grow sick with worry. And DO tell me if you have a love-life or 
not, because nice &#145;guys&#39; like you deserve to have love. I only wonder, 
though, which direction will you turn in? (chuckles) Seriously, write 
back, or I will be cross. Ever loving and sincere, S. B.&quot;

Rai grinned as she read the letter, and knowing that brevity was the 
soul of wit, she typed only a few sentences.

&quot;Sorry, I think I did lose your address. I am still alive, just...busy. 
I hope we&#39;ll talk later. Sorry, I can&#39;t think of anything else to say 
right now; I&#39;m on &#145;holiday&#39;. It is good to hear from you again. And yes, 
I am in love, but mum&#39;s the word on that. Returning your love and 
sincerity, R. Z.&quot;

Rai was then surprised to see, not five minutes later, an instant 
message come up. It was from her, the girl that had sent her that email.

HotshotSB3: Hullo! So you DO remember me!

Rai checked the computer clock, seeing she still had quite some time 
left. Yeah, she could carry a conversation with her old friend.

AmbivalentBlu: Of course. I could never forget you. I assume you got my 
email?

HotshotSB3: Yes indeed, so nice of you to FINALLY send me a message! 
(stamps foot impatiently) Lost it, did we?

AmbivalentBlu: I&#39;m sorry about that. But I have been thinking of you.

HotshotSB3: Oh... (smile) And what&#39;s this I hear about a love-life? Come 
on, who is s/he?

AmbivalentBlu: Are you saying I&#39;m gay?

HotshotSB3: I&#39;m just opening up the field, &quot;ducky&quot;. It&#39;s all right if 
he&#39;s a man.

AmbivalentBlu: SHE is a lady.

HotshotSB3: I thought so! (laughs)

AmbivalentBlu: ...Whatever. You&#39;ll never see her anyway, you crazy 
Redcoat :P

HotshotSB3: Wow, Rai has an attitude! You&#39;ve changed a lot.

AmbivalentBlu: It&#39;s been a long time since I was in England&#151;about a 
year, nearly. Lots of things have changed. I&#39;m a different person. Hey 
Salud...

HotshotSB3: ?

AmbivalentBlu: ...Sorry if I was an ass to you and your pals.

HotshotSB3: ???

AmbivalentBlu: I admit, I was a big pain back then, and I&#39;m sorry. Hey, 
tell you what: if I do see you again, I&#39;ll treat you nicer, and I&#39;ll 
introduce you to my girlfriend. You&#39;ll like her, she&#39;s very sweet.

HotshotSB3: Aww... (great big smile) Well, it doesn&#39;t seem possible now, 
our meeting, but who knows? Maybe in the future we&#39;ll have an excuse to 
run into each other. Which state do you live in?

AmbivalentBlu: ...Kentucky. (just kidding!)

HotshotSB3: (surprised look) I was about to say!! Oh, sorry&#151;I really 
have to go. You will email me more often, right?

AmbivalentBlu: Of course, you go and do your thing. Bye, or cheerio&#151;I 
forgot the Welsh farewell.

HotshotSB3: You brick! (waves bye)

After logging off, Rai explored the rest of the gallery, but didn&#39;t come 
across anything new, except Shaylee. How odd, to meet two friends in one 
place; it was as if some greater force had caused them all to be 
together. Zanders felt warm from the connection&#151;three girls, three 
different stories&#151;and openly smiled, showing her quiet feminine side 
happily. Shaylee was kind enough to offer her a ride home, but Rai 
declined politely. The two parted ways, with Zanders wondering if, 
somewhere down the road, she would really see either one of them again. 
For now, there was only Ana, the return trip back to Stanton, and two 
and a half months until she was freed from high school.

......

That night, the whole cast and crew threw a party&#151;not just because it 
was their last night there and they wanted to end everything with a 
bang, but because Madeline and Kiki had announced their engagement as 
well. Ivory and Ancelin were especially beside themselves with 
happiness, and made a louder noise than anyone else. Several jugs of 
soda and even a few bottles of wine were passed around, and everyone, 
regardless of their age, drank and was merry. Rai came back a little 
late, but not so late that she missed the fun; she made a special toast 
to the Lu family for their generosity in taking everyone into their 
home, and said she was completely at their service from that day on.

When at last the noise died down, everyone retired to their rooms, or 
else the shower to wash up. Rai told Ana how she had spent the day, not 
forgetting to include her chance meetings with two friends. Ana, blithe 
and merry as the day Rai had met her, was happy that her girlfriend was 
making friends, even if they were all long-distance.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, noticing a bag Rai had discarded earlier on their bed, 
&quot;what&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;One of Shaylee&#39;s CDs I bought,&quot; she answered. &quot;I know how tough it can 
be for musicians, and buying their stuff is about the best thing you 
could do for them. It boosts their confidence and their wallets.&quot;

&quot;Well that was darn sweet of you!&quot; she exclaimed, hugging the tall girl. 
&quot;So why don&#39;t you play some of it? I could use some music about now.&quot; 
Rai thought it a good idea, and took out the small CD player she had 
brought with her. The first track was an all-time favorite of hers, a 
Frank Sinatra song that Shaylee completely nailed. It was a very good 
way to end the Spring Break vacation; Rai even sang along with it as the 
artist went through the song a second time.

Fly me to the moon and let me play among the stars

Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars

In other words, hold my hand

In other words, darling kiss me

Fill my heart with song and let me sing forevermore

You are all I long for, all I worship and adore

In other words, please be true!

In other words, I love you!</pre>
