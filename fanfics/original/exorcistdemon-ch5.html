<h1>The Exorcist and the Demon (part 5 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>      Mina was aware that the bed she was lying on was extremely soft and there was a hand 
gently stroking her hair. She let out a few murmurs and the hand continued to ruffle her 
hair. &quot;...mommy? Is it time to get up already...?&quot;

      She heard a chuckle. &quot;Not quite, my dear...&quot; Mina&#39;s eyes snapped open and she realized 
that she wasn&#39;t at home. When she tried to jump off the bed, Isaka held her down. &quot;Whoa, 
there. You aren&#39;t going anywhere until we solve your problem.&quot;

      She pushed Mina back down on the bed and lied down next to her. &quot;I&#39;m Isaka and I am 
here to help you and your unrequited love.&quot; Mina blushed a bright red. &quot;We&#39;re just 
friends...!&quot;

      The demon just scoffed. &quot;Right. And that&#39;s why whenever you see her you feel warm... 
and she makes you feel safe, special, important... most of all, you can&#39;t think of a life 
without her being in it.&quot; Mina sat up, surprised. &quot;How... how... did you know all that?&quot;

      Isaka just grinned like a cat. &quot;I didn&#39;t.&quot; Mina caught the meaning and buried her face 
in her hands. &quot;Oh my God... I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m in love with... I&#39;m in love with Eveon...&quot; 
She gulped and tried to quell the funny feelings in her stomach. &quot;There we go. At least 
you&#39;ve admitted it. Come,&quot; Isaka got off the bed and offered Mina her hand. &quot;I can&#39;t let you 
starve, can I?&quot;

      Isaka let the flustered girl down the hall and they had dinner together. As Mina was 
eating her food, she was still trying to make sense of the whole situation. In love with 
Eveon...? It... was nerve-racking, but somewhere in her heart, it felt right. She almost 
jumped out of her chair when she felt a hand run through her hair.

      &quot;You have such beautiful tresses,&quot; Isaka murmured, &quot;Why do you keep it so short?&quot; Mina 
blushed as she ruffled her own locks. They didn&#39;t even brush her shoulders and her mom 
always said they were a voluminous mess, but... &quot;Um... it&#39;s because... 
Eveon-really-likes-it!&quot; She blurted out that last part and stared down at her plate, 
embarrassed. Out of the corner of her eye, Mina could see the smug grin on Isaka&#39;s face.

      &quot;Now then, I&#39;m going to tell you how you&#39;re going to get Eveon to love you back.&quot; Mina 
gave Isaka a shocked look as the demon led her back to the guest room. As soon as she was 
seated on the comfy bed, Isaka started to give her tips. &quot;First off, you can&#39;t outright 
confess your love. The only time you can do that is if she tries to deny or question your 
feelings.&quot;

      Mina just nodded, dumbfounded. &quot;Second, you have to find a subliminal hint.&quot; Isaka 
looked intently into her eyes and realized the 14 year old wasn&#39;t quite sure what that 
meant. &quot;In other words, you have to find a way to make Eveon drop a hint. She probably has 
intimate feelings for you, but she&#39;s blinded by the friendship factor. When you find that 
hint, go for it.&quot;

      Mina blushed again and shook her head. &quot;Wh-what? How am I supposed to do that, I-I&#39;m 
not aggressive, so...&quot; Isaka just grabbed her chin to steady her head. &quot;If you want Eveon, 
you&#39;re going to have to make the first move...&quot; Mina took a deep breath and nodded. Of 
course, the next thing Isaka said startled her.

      &quot;Do you know how to kiss a girl?&quot; Mina&#39;s silence told Isaka enough. &quot;All you have to 
do... is be gentle and slow. You&#39;ll know the right time when to get passionate and remember; 
you&#39;re both girls so you know how she&#39;d want to be kissed.&quot;

      Mina flopped down on the bed. &quot;I don&#39;t think I can do this, Isaka!&quot; The demon just 
sighed and went to the closet to look for something. &quot;When you&#39;re in love, you can do 
anything.&quot; Isaka pulled a white Victorian style dress out and handed it to the girl. &quot;Wear 
this. I&#39;m afraid everything here is a bit old fashion.&quot;

      The demon turned around as Mina changed. &quot;Chances are... Eveon&#39;s going to come rescue 
you.&quot; Mina straightened out the dress and gave her a confused look. &quot;She... she wouldn&#39;t do 
that. She&#39;s probably still mad at me.&quot; Isaka just let out a laugh. &quot;Goodness, since when did 
girls become so blind?&quot;

      She sat down on the bed and motioned Mina to do the same. &quot;Eveon&#39;s a lucky girl...&quot; 
Isaka murmured as she played with Mina&#39;s hair. &quot;Or you&#39;re lucky that you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re a few years off 
my personal preference.&quot; She gave Mina a playful wink and the younger girl blanched. Isaka 
just laughed and leaned in to whisper in her ear.

      &quot;My young friend... you&#39;re going to go to sleep and the next time you awaken will be 
when Eveon comes to rescue you...&quot; Mina tried to move away from her. &quot;Isaka! W-wait!&quot; The 
demon just ignored her and kissed her on the forehead. &quot;Pleasant dreams, Mina.&quot;

      The 14 year old couldn&#39;t protest as her eyes fluttered shut and her body relaxed. 
Isaka set her down gently on the bed and flicked a piece of hair away from her face. Mina 
drifted off until... 

***** 

      &quot;...until you came and rescued me.&quot; Eveon just stared at her. &quot;So that demon set it up 
so I would be your... uh... knight in shining armor?&quot; Mina nodded and started to nibble on 
her own sandwich. &quot;...and last night...? I gave you a subliminal hint...?&quot;

      Mina blushed and peeked into the basket to pull out more goodies. &quot;W-well... I... 
Everything I told you was the truth and then... you said that being with me makes you smile 
so...&quot; They made brief eye contact and looked away from each other. &quot;Mina... it makes me 
glad that you&#39;re honest with me. I... just... I don&#39;t feel like that...&quot;

      Her friend just bit her lip. &quot;I know.&quot; Eveon looked over and felt her heart wrench as 
Mina started to cry. &quot;I just... really like you, but I screwed up, huh?&quot; Mina started to sob 
and Eveon wasn&#39;t sure what to do. Eventually, the blonde girl took her friend in her arms 
and started to rub her back. &quot;Please... please don&#39;t cry, Mina.&quot;

      Of course, that didn&#39;t help any. &quot;Even if I don&#39;t share your feelings, I&#39;m still your 
best friend.&quot; Mina looked up at her. &quot;R-r-r-really? Y-you still want to b-be my friend?&quot; she 
asked, through choked sobs. &quot;Of course! Why would I abandon you?&quot; Mina looked really 
relieved, but the tears kept flowing. She gently laid her head on Eveon&#39;s shoulder.

      &quot;Please... hold me...?&quot; Eveon just smiled and hugged her friend tightly. After a long 
while, Mina stopped crying and pulled away. &quot;I-I guess... you wouldn&#39;t want any chocolate 
cake would you?&quot; At that, both of them cracked up until the sun started setting. Eveon 
giggled some more before answering. &quot;Sadly, I actually do want some!&quot;

      They laughed some more and started to eat the cake. &quot;Eveon?&quot; The blonde girl turned at 
the mention of her name. &quot;Hmm? What&#39;s up?&quot; Mina took a deep breath. &quot;...I guess we&#39;re best 
friends now, but we both acknowledge my feelings?&quot; Eveon thought to herself and nodded. &quot;I 
guess that&#39;s a weird relationship, but... I still want to be your friend.&quot;

      Mina just smiled and started to pack up the picnic. As they started walking pack, 
Eveon noticed some chocolate frosting on the corner of Mina&#39;s mouth. Out of habit, she wiped 
it away with her middle finger. Mina stopped abruptly and just looked at Eveon and the 
chocolate frosting on her middle finger. Eveon was about to laugh or make a joke about it, 
but Mina surprised her.

      She grabbed Eveon&#39;s hand and took the finger in her mouth. The blonde girl&#39;s face 
turned steadily redder as she suckled on her finger and lapped up the frosting. When Mina 
finally relinquished her finger, Eveon was stiff as a statue, her face suffering from tomato 
syndrome. Eveon was partially brought back to reality when Mina giggled. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, 
Eveon? You&#39;re flushed.&quot; Oh, Mina knew what was wrong alright... she leaned in and Eveon 
backed up a bit, recognizing the mischievous glint in Mina&#39;s eye.

      That usually meant a practical joke, but in this case... Eveon wasn&#39;t quite so sure. 
Mina walked a bit forward, backing up Eveon to a nearby tree. The blonde girl had never 
really paid attention to their height, but Mina had always been a tad bit taller. Right now, 
it felt like she was towering over the poor blonde. &quot;Are you okay, Eveon? You&#39;re not sick 
are you?&quot; Mina ran a hand over one of her red cheeks and Eveon could have cussed out her 
friend for playing with her like this.

      She hated when this happen. One moment, Mina was maternal and kind, or fragile and 
vulnerable and then BAM! All of sudden, she was mischievous and teasing and now... Eveon was 
subject to her blatant flirting and seduction. &quot;I-I-I feel j-just fine...&quot; Eveon stammered 
out as Mina touched her forehead to her own.

      &quot;Really? It doesn&#39;t seem like it...&quot; Mina leaned in and Eveon let her eyes close. 
Sure, Mina was her best friend, but she&#39;d never been good when standing up to her when she 
got in a mood. She could feel Mina&#39;s breath on her lips and Eveon didn&#39;t move. Maybe she 
wanted it too... Mina&#39;s lips barely brushed against her own and-

      &quot;What are you doing?!&quot; Mina jerked away from Eveon and both girls looked to the side. 
The shrill voice had come from none other than Melanie, Mina&#39;s mother. &quot;M-M-M-Mommy!&quot; Both 
girls exchanged looks and moved away from each other. &quot;I-I-I was just... I was just 
t-telling Eveon a secret and I wanted to whisper it in her-&quot; Her mother cut her off.

      &quot;Where? In her lips?!&quot; Mina looked down at the ground, flustered, and Melanie took in 
the sight of both girls&#39; disheveled states. &quot;I came all this way to drop off those cookies 
you made this morning for your picnic and I find... I find... you- both of you, up against 
each other like that?! What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; Eveon tried her hand at quelling the woman. 
&quot;Mrs. Lamet, she just... we kind of tripped on the way back and-&quot;

      Melanie shook her head. &quot;Not another word from you! You&#39;re supposed to be her 
friend... I trusted both of you to behave and I knew...! It must be that damned demon,&quot; 
Melanie grabbed her daughter by the wrist and started dragging her home. &quot;And you, Eveon!&quot; 
she shouted over her shoulder at the blonde, &quot;You go back to your mother and have her teach 
you how to behave! I should have known better then to let my daughter hang around a tomboy 
who has no father...&quot; Even though Melanie muttered the last part, it still pierced Eveon in 
the heart.

      As Melanie pulled the struggling Mina with her, Eveon could still hear them arguing. 
&quot;Mommy! It&#39;s not Eveon! It&#39;s not her fault! I wanted it! I wanted to do it...!&quot; Her voice 
started to fade and Eveon wiped away the tears that were starting to prick her eyes. She 
started her solemn walk home, already knowing that the Lamets would call her mother and her 
mother would...

      Well, she&#39;d probably react like Melanie did.
