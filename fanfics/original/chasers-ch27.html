<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 27 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/chasers-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>        Dr. Alexis Jameson felt a bit of nervousness, something that the 
dark haired woman took great pains to hide as she entered the bar. It 
was right on the edge of Lowtown, not quite in the slums but near enough 
to seem dangerous to those living on the higher levels.

        The heavily muscled bouncer looked her over, taking in her suit 
and styled hair with a slight smile. &quot;You&#39;re Dr. Jameson?&quot; he smiled, 
then shook his head. &quot;No one else you could be. Christa&#39;s waiting for 
you at a back table.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Alexis nodded.

        The bar was mobbed, filled with both young and old, wealthy and 
not so wealthy. Club rats, hanger ons, cyberpunks and a dozen other 
groups mingled uneasily out on the front dance floor. She cut through 
the mob to the back, meeting the gaze of another bouncer. A female, and 
quite clearly an android, her face was marked by a single scar.

        The black haired woman looked at her coldly, &quot;You know someone?&quot;

        &quot;Alexis,&quot; she introduced herself, meeting the woman&#39;s gaze 
calmly, &quot;Nyara and Christa are expecting me, I think.&quot;

        The woman smiled slightly. &quot;You&#39;ve got spunk,&quot; she mused, &quot;I 
like that.&quot; She opened the door and nodded her in as she said, &quot;I&#39;m 
Yume.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll remember,&quot; Alexis answered calmly. Normally this backroom 
was a fetish club, the people within participating in acts rarely 
discussed in polite company. Today it was quiet, a sense of a storm 
coming as groups met and talked around the room.

        The white haired Christa wasn&#39;t garbed in her usual leathers, 
and the tawny haired Nyara stood beside her, talking openly. Christa saw 
Alexis near and smiled, but the hard look in her eyes didn&#39;t soften. 
&quot;Alexis, you&#39;re here,&quot; she said.

        &quot;You did ask me to,&quot; Alexis answered. Her own eyes narrowed in 
anger, &quot;I thought it was a pretty effective message too, especially 
after every one of my contacts in the rights movement suddenly decided 
not to talk to me.&quot;

        &quot;You have to admit we&#39;ve got cause to be concerned,&quot; Nyara said 
diplomatically, &quot;considering you&#39;ve been seen consorting with the 
enemy.&quot;

        A muscle in Alexis&#39; jaw jumped as she clenched it. Keeping her 
temper under tight reign she said, &quot;If that&#39;s as little trust I&#39;ve 
earned, so be it.&quot; With that she turned and walked towards the door.

        &quot;That was fast,&quot; Yume said as Alexis stalked by her.

        &quot;I don&#39;t think I have anything I want to talk to them about,&quot; 
Alexis growled.

        &quot;Hold on a minute,&quot; Yume grabbed her arm, holding it with 
surprising gentleness. She tilted her head to the side, &quot;What happened?&quot;

        &quot;It doesn&#39;t much matter, Yume,&quot; Alexis said, her anger fading a 
bit, &quot;I&#39;m done. If they don&#39;t trust me by now ...&quot;

        Yume looked down at her a moment, then nodded once. &quot;Come on,&quot; 
and ignoring Alexis protests Yume tugged her along right back to where a 
startled Nyara and Christa stood. She parked Alexis then turned to the 
pair, &quot;You both know this lady has put it on the line for us before. 
She&#39;s earned some courtesy, if nothing else.&quot;

        Christa hesitated, then nodded. &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; she said to 
Yume, then she turned to Alexis. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she executed a small bow.

        &quot;Yume&#39;s right,&quot; Nyara quietly admitted. She looked over at 
Alexis and asked, &quot;Could we talk about this, please?&quot;

        Alexis hesitated, then nodded in return. &quot;All right,&quot; she 
agreed, &quot;let&#39;s talk.&quot; She turned back to say something to Yume only to 
notice the woman was gone, returned to watching the door.

        They walked back to one of the tables, Christa waving Alexis to 
a seat. She held out a chair for Nyara, pushing it in as she sat, then 
Christa took a seat herself. Christa&#39;s nearly white hair fell into her 
eyes as she studied Alexis thoughtfully.

        &quot;Could you tell me what&#39;s going on,&quot; Christa finally asked 
softly, &quot;from your perspective?&quot;

        Alexis nodded slightly. &quot;I raised the alarm as soon as I heard 
about the possible police crackdown on the freewills,&quot; she finally said, 
&quot;but what you don&#39;t know is I got the information from a contact in the 
Chasers itself.&quot;

        Nyara sat up straight, looking at Alexis in surprise, &quot;You&#39;re 
serious?&quot;

        &quot;Very much so,&quot; Alexis nodded. She smiled slightly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
intend to name him or her, but this contact has provided me information 
before.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I understand this officer&#39;s motivations,&quot; 
Christa frowned, &quot;the Chasers job is to go after androids.&quot;

        &quot;Androids that break the law, yes,&quot; Alexis agreed. She tilted 
her head to the side, &quot;But are Freewills breaking the law? No.&quot;

        Nyara nodded slightly, &quot;I see your point. So in your opinion the 
Chasers are not our enemy?&quot;

        &quot;Yes and no,&quot; Alexis was as honest as she could. &quot;From what I&#39;ve 
learned about them they have no enmity towards the Freewills,&quot; she 
explained, &quot;but they are bound by the political decisions of the city 
and government.&quot;

        &quot;So we need to make sure the law doesn&#39;t change,&quot; Christa mused, 
&quot;or keep the pressure up on the Mayor to protect android rights.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s about it, yes,&quot; Alexis said. She hesitated, &quot;You should 
also be careful about targeting any of the Chasers in your activities.&quot;

        &quot;We stopped the distribution of photos of Williams,&quot; Nyara said. 
She frowned, &quot;Though I still feel her actions make her a fair target.&quot;

        &quot;Love,&quot; Christa murmured to Nyara cautioningly.

        &quot;You might want to look into Kate Williams background before you 
judge her,&quot; Alexis said, her narrowed eyes showing her anger. &quot;It&#39;s all 
in the public record.&quot;

        Nyara looked at her curiously, then nodded slightly, &quot;I&#39;ll do 
that.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry for the misunderstanding,&quot; Christa said, &quot;and I hope 
you&#39;ll continue to support the android rights movement.&quot;

        Alexis rose from her seat, &quot;I&#39;ll do what I can.&quot;

        The two women waited until Alexis walked away before talking 
softly. &quot;What do you think?&quot; Nyara asked curiously.

        &quot;She&#39;s not wrong,&quot; Christa finally said with a sigh, &quot;but she 
doesn&#39;t know about the entire situation, either.&quot;

        &quot;And do you really think the Chasers might be sympathetic to 
us?&quot; Nyara raised an elegant eyebrow questioningly.

        &quot;It&#39;s certainly possible. I had some of our people do some 
research on the Chasers,&quot; Christa took out a slim computer pad, &quot;Gwen 
Musashi isn&#39;t your typical police officer.&quot;

        &quot;Alexis said something about Kate Williams background,&quot; Nyara 
mused, &quot;do you have her personal history on there?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Christa said, &quot;I&#39;ll just..&quot; She scrolled through the 
data, then her dark eyes widened slightly as she murmured, &quot;Oh, dear.&quot;

        Silently Christa passed the device to Nyara, a section 
highlighted. Nyara groaned softly, &quot;Her parents were killed by an 
android. No wonder she hates us.&quot;

        &quot;Not.. exactly,&quot; the quiet voice said. Yume pulled out a seat, 
the dark haired woman sitting down where Alexis had been.

        &quot;You know something?&quot; Christa asked curiously.

        &quot;A rumor around Lowtown,&quot; Yume said softly. &quot;A woman of Kate&#39;s 
description has been seen with a Freewill down there,&quot; she confided.

        &quot;Isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Nyara mused. &quot;Do we know who it is 
she&#39;s visiting?&quot;

        &quot;I can probably find out,&quot; Yume smiled.

        &quot;Thanks for stepping in that way,&quot; Christa said seriously. &quot;It&#39;s 
been a long couple of days, but we nearly fumbled that badly.&quot;

        &quot;No problem,&quot; Yume said casually. A bit more seriously she 
added, &quot;The doctor&#39;s got a good reputation among us, I figured we 
wouldn&#39;t want to lose her.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; Nyara agreed.
