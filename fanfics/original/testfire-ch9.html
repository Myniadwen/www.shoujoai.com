<a href="../original/testfire-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Motoko Fitzgerald studied Jack Scott as the redhead
carefully did her makeup, skillfully downplaying the
Asian cast to her features. Sandy brown hair fell into
the other lady&#39;s piercing blue eyes, the face itself
oddly handsome looking, really, her slim body sheathed
in a deceptively simple black dress. If someone had
told Motoko that this pretty young woman was a
bodyguard and investigator, she wasn&#39;t sure if she
would have believed it.

&#39;Why did father choose to hire an outsider,&#39; Motoko
wondered, &#39;instead of calling on one of the Shogun&#39;s
men?&#39; She frowned slightly as she looked up at Jack,
&quot;Are you planning to shadow me all night? What if I
decide to go home with a client?&quot;

&quot;Not going to happen,&quot; Jack answered calmly,. &quot;This
isn&#39;t a bawdy house, you might keep them company but
you don&#39;t go home with them.&quot;

&quot;Very sharp,&quot; Motoko nodded slightly, feeling her
frown easing involuntarily. This Scott was clearly
wiser than she first looked, she might even live up to
her inflated reputation.

There was a dangerous twinkle in Jack&#39;s eye as she
said, &quot;Which makes me wonder why Davidson lied to me
at first, claiming you were a goodtime girl and his
lover.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d have to ask him that,&quot; Motoko felt a flash of
anger, only her experience keeping it off her face.
&#39;How dare he...?&#39; she thought.

As the other woman watched her put on her makeup there
was a flicker of something on Jack&#39;s face, the other
woman stiffening just slightly. Motoko finished,
rising even as she looked over at Jack curiously to
ask, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

&quot;No, nothing,&quot; Jack smiled back at her while adjusting
the small earrings she wore, but she was clearly
holding something back.

Motoko was tempted to push her on it, but something in
Jack&#39;s look said she wasn&#39;t going to talk about it.
&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; she told Jack as they walked together
to the door.

The club was an old, familiar friend to Motoko now, a
converted set of business offices in Chinatown. The
connecting walls that had subdivided the large space
had beren knocked down, new carpet laid down even as
fixtures and furnishings had been brought in. It
almost felt like another era in the club, one far
before the meteors and all the chages that they
brought.

Motoko carefully noted the mood of the crowd, smiling
slightly as she saw Heather singing the next song in
her usual number. The glossy black haired beauty
swayed up on the stage, her full breasts straining
against the simple gown she wore as she sang a torch
song. She was&#39;t a bad preformer, even if she didn&#39;t
quite get the songs spot on.

&quot;Jade Flower preforms here often?&quot; Jack asked with a
false sort of casualness.

Motoko had to fight back a smile at the mildlty
annoyed look on Jack&#39;s face but answered mildly,
&quot;Merely as a hostess, I think. She&#39;s quite popular,
too.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Jack murmured.

A figure waved and Motoko hurried over, the night soon
falling into it&#39;s usual pattern. Motooko chatted with
customers, danced and entertained people, using her
charm to induce them to stay and buy more food and
drinks, spemnding on her and Jack. Surprisingly Jack
was a subtle presence, muting her usual impact and
actually helping them do their jobs.

&quot;You can be remarkably pleasant, Scott-san,&quot; Motoko
murmured.

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Jack said, frowning slightly as she saw
someone approaching.

Motoko turned to look, her lips rising into a warm
smile as her friend approached them. Chizuru chuckled
softly, the little blonde smiling as she nodded to
Jack and said, &quot;Your friend is proving to be popular,
too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure this is quite my thing,&quot; Jack said
diplomatically.

Chizuru gave her a wry look, then she gazed over at
Motoko and asked, &quot;Would you mind singing tonight?&quot;

Motoko bowed her head slightly, &quot;Of course, I&#39;d be
glad to.&quot;

A few moments later Motoko found herself up on the
little stage over to the side, raising a microphone to
her lips. &quot;Welcome to the Nightingale,&quot; she said to
the crowd formally, &quot;a place of music and relaxation
in our modern world. Let our hostesses take you away
from it all....&quot;

Jack watched from the shadows nearby, and Motoko found
herself wondering what this woman thought of it all.
For a westerner Jack was remarkably difficult to read,
only the occassional moments of jealousy or anger
showing through her iron control.

Raising her voice in song Motoko smiled, crooning to
the people even as she noticed Heather quietly making
her way through the shadows over to stand by Jack&#39;s
side. &#39;They do know each other,&#39; she noted even as she
sang, &#39;isn&#39;t that interesting.&#39;

Heather was speaking to Jack, possibly trying to
explain her presence in the club. By the look on
Jack&#39;s face she hadn&#39;t known about Heathjer&#39;s
occupation, and it had been a unpleasant surprise.
Finally Heather left, back stiff with anger, and Jack
looked after her with a achingly lost expression on
her handsome face.

&quot;Treat the Nightingale kindly and she will sing for
you,&quot; Motoko finished up her preformance as she slid
the microphone into it&#39;s stand, &quot;but this one has to
retire for the night.&quot; To the respectful sound of
claspping she slid down from the stage towards the
tables, unsurprisded to see Jack materialize at her
side.

&quot;You&#39;re very good,&quot; Jack said calmly as they moved
forward together, her voice showing none of the strain
from just having an argument.

&#39;Remarkable self control,&#39; Motoko found herself noting
once again. &quot;I&#39;m pretty much finished for the night,&quot;
she said, &quot;if you want to go.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Jack gave a wintery smile as they headed to
the doors, Motoko giving her farewells, &quot;you have no
idea how nerrvous I was having you up on that stage
where any shooter could have tried going for you.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t seriously think someone would try to shoot
me,&quot; Motoko blinked at Jack in shock as they went out
into the Vancouver night together.

Jack helped Motoko slip on the jacket she left up
front after subtlely checking it over. &quot;We don&#39;t know
the objectives of whoever is after you or Davidson,&quot;
Jack aswered simply, pulling her jacket on too, &quot;so I
can&#39;t guess what they might do.&quot;

&quot;Comforting,&quot; Motoko shivered just a bit and not from
the cold.

Jack heard a horse taxi coming up Main Street and
flagged it down, helping Motoko up into the back seat.
&quot;Woodwards building,&quot; she instructed the driver,
passed him a coin and they were off.

&quot;Why are we going back to your office?&quot; Motoko asked
Jack quietly, sitting back with a soft sigh of pure
relief.

&quot;Got to pick up a few pieces of clothes,&quot; Jack said
frankly as they clattered down main towards Hastings,
turning west then up towards Woodwards, &quot;then we can
decide where to hole up.&quot;

Above them stars gleamed through the cloudless night,
the moon lighting up the streets where people of all
types still wandered. &quot;It&#39;s a bit late to be running
around,&quot; Motoko said hesitantly, &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you
have a couch I could borrow?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jack replied simply, her expression
clearly distracted as they passed between the battered
buildings. Suddenly she grabbed Motoko even as she
threw them out of the cab, the other woman crying out
in alarm even as a shot rang out.

&quot;What in the....&quot; Motoko stammered.

Jack pulled the pistol from where it was strapped to
her thigh, looking around coolly then firing once,
twice into the night. &quot;Looks like someone decided to
make our night more exciting,&quot; she answered coldly,
&quot;probably warning shots.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Motoko demanded, her heart pounding in her ears
even as Jack gently shielded her with her own body.

&quot;Even at night it&#39;s not that hard to hit something,&quot;
Jack scanned their surroundings warily, &quot;before the
taxi bolted I saw they put the shot right through the
roof.&quot;

&quot;You take this so calmly,&quot; Motoko said weakly as Jack
eased up, helping her rise to her feet.

&quot;Practice,&quot; Jack answered dryly. They raced down the
restr of the way to the Woodwards building, Jack
unlocking the main doors and then letting them inside.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want that kind of practice,&quot; Motoko
admitted as Jack lead them over to the stairs, all the
while keeping a gentle grip on her hand.

&quot;Occassionally I&#39;d agree with you,&quot; Jack answered
frankly.</pre>
