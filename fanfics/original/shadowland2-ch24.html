<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 24 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Jennifer glanced around Tanya&#39;s room for a moment, even though she had 
been in the room the other day it felt different somehow. She scanned 
the empty side of the room and sat down upon the bed, &quot;I really did live 
here, didn&#39;t I?&quot; She asked Tanya as her friend brought some empty boxes 
into the room and set them upon her bed. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Tanya states heavy-heartedly and watched as Jenn lay back on the 
bed, &quot;I missed talking with you late at night. Those were great days.&quot; 

Jenn folded her hands behind her head and lay back on the bed, &quot;Ever 
since returning from those woods everything feels so different. I keep 
getting fragments of memories here and there of things that made no 
sense before. The more I think about it the more this place feels right 
and the other place feels like a dream.&quot; She explained, and then tilted 
her head slightly and squinted at the wall above her as if she was 
trying to focus on something that was not there, &quot;I hung a poster here, 
didn&#39;t I?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Tanya glanced up at the spot on the wall and smiled, &quot;Yeah, It was one 
o-&quot; 

&quot;Cloe!!&quot; Jenn declared excitedly, the same poster that was in her dream 
room, then that would mean... She quickly sat up and looked at the 
wardrobe. On the front of the door was a hook to hang ones clothes just 
like the one on the back of her bedroom door just above another poster, 
&quot;And on one the door of my wardrobe of Melissa Ethridge, right?&quot;  She 
quizzed pointing to the wardrobe at the foot of the bed. 

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Tanya exclaimed, enthusiastic that her friend was getting her 
memory back. 

Jenn rolled over on the bed with her head on the pillow and a smile upon 
her face, &quot;This really was my bed.&quot; She breathed in and smelled 
something familiar, rolling over she buried her face in the pillow and 
inhaled, then lifted her head to look down at the pillow, &quot;I... is this 
the same pillow that I used to sleep on?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Tanya nodded, &quot;Yeah,&quot; She agreed, &quot;I made sure they did not take your 
blankets or pillow after you were gone.&quot; She frowned, &quot;I wish they would 
have told me that they were taking your stuff though.&quot; 

&quot;K... Kris slept here...&quot; She swallowed hard as her mind filled with 
memories of Kris&#39;s warm embrace, &quot;She used to sleep with me...&quot; Jenn 
began to tremble at the realization. 

Tanya sat down on the floor next to Jenn&#39;s bed, &quot;She would sleep over a 
lot.&quot; Tanya stated with a sly grin, &quot;Since she is the Head Mistresses 
niece and not registered to either wing they let her stay overnight. I 
don&#39;t think anyone, aside from me, really knew how close you two were.&quot; 

Jenn rolled over in the bed again, &quot;We made out here.&quot; She remarked in a 
bit of a daze. 

Tanya blushed, &quot;Yeah...&quot; She replied, &quot;You too were not very subtle. You 
tried to keep quiet but I knew what you were up too. 

Jenn lightly touched her lips as the memories of Kris&#39;s kiss came to 
mind. A soft, deep and passionate kiss, nothing like the memory of her 
childhood kiss with Kim. Suddenly her mind was invaded by the image 
Jessica and Kris. There was something about the way they were looking at 
each other earlier that was bothering Jenn, &quot;Tanya..?&quot; She inquired 
cautiously.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Tanya set her head on Jenn&#39;s bed and watched the girl, 
&quot;Something wrong?&quot; She could sense something was bothering her friend, 
but with everything that had happened in the past few days she was not 
sure what it could be. 

&quot;Do you think there is something going on between Jessica and...&quot; Jenn 
swallowed hard as she did not want to admit aloud what she was feeling 
inside, &quot;...between Jessie an.. and Kris...&quot;

Tanya slowly turned her back to Jenn and leaned against the bed. Her 
gaze drifted to the photo of Jenn and Kris that sat upon her desk, as it 
had for over a year. She knew the moment she had laid eyes on Kris again 
after all that time that Kris&#39;s heart was hurting, it showed in her eyes 
and the way she refused to look Tanya in the eyes. Then there was the 
look upon her face this morning, a look of embarrassment and something 
else. She thought long and hard over everything that had happened 
recently before feeling she could respond. 

&quot;I think Kris loves you with all her heart.&quot; Tanya finally replied, &quot;I 
don&#39;t think she would leave you after waiting so long for you to 
return.&quot; She explained her heart ached at the lie she had told. She 
really wanted to tell Jenn about what she saw that morning. She was sure 
that Kris and Jessica were making out and she had no doubts that Jessica 
would go after Kris. She had to admit that she even found Kris hot, but 
the question that was haunting her was if Kris was willing or was it all 
just one sided. She decided it was better not to upset her friend when 
she was in such a fragile state and she would allow Kris to come forward 
if she truly intended on breaking things off with Jenn, which Tanya 
prayed would never happen.

Jenn let out a slight sigh of relief, &quot;Yeah... I guess so...&quot; She 
remarked, pushing the small bit of worry she had out of her heart. 

Tanya got to her feet and offered a hand to Jenn, &quot;Come on.&quot; She nodded 
at the door, &quot;Let&#39;s get Cherilyn and find some lunch. The cafeteria 
should be serving lunch by now.&quot; She explained with a glance at her 
watch. 

Jenn took her friend&#39;s hand and allowed herself to be pulled out of the 
bed, &quot;I have been hungry for the past while. Was considering digging 
into my chips if lunch did not arrive soon.&quot; She stated licking her lips 
at the bag of Doritos sitting at the foot of Tanya&#39;s bed. She want even 
more to skip lunch and just rip open a bag of Zesty Cheese, however 
Tanya pull her out of the room before she could go through with her 
plans. 

&quot;Cherilyn, should be finished packing her clothes by now.&quot; Tanya stated 
with a slight bit of uncertainty in her voice. Cherilyn had demanded 
that they let her finish her packing on her own and that they should 
start on Tanya&#39;s room so they could leave the dorm before it filled with 
girls as everyone returned from school. Tanya on the other had was 
unsure if Cherilyn would actually finish her packing, throughout the 
entire time they were packing Cherilyn was moving extremely slowly, as 
if she was trying to slow the process down, &quot;Do you think she is really 
ready for this move?&quot; Tanya asked anxiously. 

&quot;She will be fine.&quot; Jenn stated confidently, &quot;She decided to go through 
with this on her own. She may be taking it slow, but if you consider the 
fact that she will be leaving all her friends behind to be with you we 
should give her as much time as she needs.&quot; 

&quot;I guess so.&quot; Tanya admitted, &quot;Let&#39;s find out what is for lunch 
alright?&quot;
