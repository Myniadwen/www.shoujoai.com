<a href="../original/descent-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>&quot;She&#39;s hiding out where?&quot; the Lady Diana asked, the
tall blonde narrowing her eyes in displeasure. She sat
on what could only be thought of as a throne, the room
around her decorated as beautifully as any palace in
the world.

Grace visibly paled under the Lady&#39;s stern gaze but
the dark haired woman bravely continued on, &quot;It
appears that the woman called Descent and the priest
Samantha Teresa are both taking refuge at the
Daughters of Artemis.&quot;

The Lady&#39;s eyes glittered with anger as she hissed,
&quot;Why weren&#39;t they stopped before they could reach
there?&quot;

&quot;We didn&#39;t know they would risk it,&quot; Grace answered
promptly, &quot;or that the owners of the bar would risk
angering you by taking them in.&quot;

Lady Diana looked off into the distance, silently
considering the situation. With a degree of reluctance
she said,. &quot;Remind any of the freelancers in town that
the Daughters in neutral territory, and that no
attempts are to be made on the demon while she is
there.&quot;

Grace hesitated, &quot;The freelancers in town aren&#39;t
directly connected to us, we could simply deny any
connection to them.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be a fool,&quot; Lady Diana&#39;s eyes flashed with
anger, &quot;I gave my word when the bar opened that it
would be neutral territory. The consequences of
breaking my word would be... dangerous, to say the
least.&quot;

&quot;Of course ma&#39;am,&quot; Grace bowed. She smiled grimly, &quot;A
independent operator attempted to set up a drug house
in the city, but it&#39;s been dealt with.&quot;

&quot;Did you handle it?&quot; Diana asked curiously.

&quot;I didn&#39;t need to,&quot; Grace answered her simply, &quot;it
seems they were foolish enough to set up in Jess
Drake&#39;s territory.&quot;

That brought a amused smile to the Lady&#39;s face. &quot;I
suspect that they&#39;ll be regretting that for awhile,&quot;
she said.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Grace agreed. She consulted her files, &quot;Lina
reports that drug shipments are back to normal, and
the weapons shipment is going through as planned. The
standard arrangements with the Mayor and chief of
police are in place.&quot;

&quot;How is the chief?&quot; Diana asked with a dangerous
smile.

&quot;He seems to be developing a spine,&quot; Grace conceded,
&quot;he&#39;s demanding to see his daughter to confirm she&#39;s
all right.&quot;

Diana raised an eyebrow, &quot;Where are we stashing the
little slut?&quot;

&quot;Selene has been.. taking care of her,&quot; Grace said
delicately.

Diana almost smiled, imagining the sorts of
depravities the redhead had initiated the young woman
into. &quot;Knowing Selene the girl is probably quite
obedient by now, so allow the father to see her.
Remind him her life depends on him choosing to obey.&quot;

&quot;Of course, ma&#39;am,&quot; Grace bowed.

&quot;You may go,&quot; Diana waved casually, the blonde
watching almost catlike as Grace left.

The room was silent as Diana sat there a moment, then
rose gracefully to walk across the lushly carpeted
floor to a dresser. From a crystal bowl she took
several red pills and swallowed them with a bit of
wine, then stalked towards the door. Opening it
silently she entered the bedroom, gazing thoughtfully
at the figure laying on the bed.

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; the redhead looked up with doe-like eyes,
her skin a gorgeous tan. Her naked body was all lush
curves, the gleaming chains making her seem even more
erotic, not less.

Diana walked over to the bed and sat down on the side,
sighing as delicate but strong hands reached up to
work her shoulders. &quot;Thank you, Luan,&quot; she murmured,
the young woman&#39;s spicy scent washing over her.

Thumbs pressed into stiff flesh, massaging with sure
confidence. &quot;You are so tense,&quot; Luan murmured, &quot;let me
help.&quot;

Diana let her business coat be stripped from her, the
her shirt was unbuttoned to reveal creamy white flesh.
She moaned as she lay face down on the bed, the lovely
Luan working over her back with skill and precision.
&quot;If I released you from your bindings,&quot; Diana asked,
&quot;what would you do first, I wonder?&quot;

&quot;Slay you most horribly,&quot; Luan answered her promptly
as she worked the muscles of her lower back, &quot;then
Selene, the one who helped bind me here.&quot;

&quot;Elves,&quot; Diana said with amusement, &quot;you are so
obsessed with vengeance.&quot;

&quot;Vengeance and honor,&quot; Luan agreed. She shifted and
pulled off Diana&#39;s heels, gently massaging her feet
first, then working up.

&quot;You know, I actually prefer you as a masseuse to
being a bedmate,&quot; Diana mused. She looked as Luan
through eyes that were heavy with pleasure, &quot;Did you
count on that?&quot;

&quot;Yes, m&#39;lady,&quot; Luan answered honestly, compelled to do
so by the enchantments in the gleaming chains that
bound her.

&quot;Even bound you are devious,&quot; Diana purred, &quot;I like
that.&quot;

Firm hands worked up muscles thighs to round buttocks,
massaging the flesh and bringing forth happy sighs.
&quot;Are you not afraid that I&#39;ll find a way to be free,&quot;
Luan asked, &quot;and carry through with my threat?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m mortal, and like all mortals I&#39;ll die sometime,&quot;
Diana shrugged, &quot;but not today or tomorrow. That is
good enough for me.&quot;

Luan delicately turned Diana over, shifting her body
so that her mistress could lay on her back. Meeting
those heavy-lidded eyes Luan conceded, &quot;I do not think
I understand mortals. The prospect of eventually dying
would fear my kind with terror.&quot;

&quot;It does many of my kind, too,&quot; Diana conceded as Luan
bent forward, her breasts brushing over Diana&#39;s bra
covered breasts. The elf massaged her upper arms,
kneading muscles, then slid down to delicately stroke
pressure points in her wrists and hands.

&quot;Better?&quot; Luan asked as she settled onto her bottom,
looking down at Diana with a carefully blank
expression on her face.

&quot;Much,&quot; Diana sighed softly.

&quot;What...?&quot; Luan gasped in surprise as Diana reached up
to grasp her arm, drawing the lushly beautiful woman
down on top of her.

Diana shushed her, pressing her lips to Luan&#39;s in a
chaste kiss, then letting her tongue slip into the
other woman&#39;s mouth. After a moment they parted, Diana
letting a hand stroke down Luan&#39;s back as she
murmured, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m feeling very... vanilla,
today.&quot;

Luan moaned softly as Diana slid a hot kiss down her
neck, then she was gently pulled up to bring her
breasts up to Diana&#39;s mouth. A raspy tongue flicked
across her swollen breasts, flicking the rock hard
nipples to a aching hardness. Shuddering with pleasure
Luan groaned musically as she rasped out, &quot;Oh
Mistress.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Diana hummed softly as she slid back and forth
between the full breasts, licking and sucking with
abandon. When the first shot of milk sprayed the
inside of her mouth Diana sucked harder, drinking the
lovely Elven nectar.

Luan mewled like a cat in heat, unconsciously wrapping
her arms around Diana&#39;s head as her breasts began to
give up their life-sustaining milk. Like all the
females of her dying kind she was always ready to give
milk, and the shudders of decadent pleasure Diana&#39;s
sucking mouth gave her were almost as good as an
orgasm.

Reluctantly Diana surrendered the breasts, a bit of
milk dripping onto Luan&#39;s gently curved belly. &quot;I
think you&#39;re most beautiful like this,&quot; she kissed
along the belly to the top of Luan&#39;s delicate folds,
&quot;filled with desire, yet not wanting to.&quot;

With tears at the corners of her eyes Luan spread her
legs with a soft moan. &quot;Please Mistress,&quot; she moaned
in pleasure.

Diana let her fingers tease wet flesh, the naturally
bare skin shuddering beneath her touch. &quot;What do you
want?&quot; she asked the lovely young woman.

&quot;Your tongue, your fingers,&quot; Luan managed, her cheeks
flushed with embarrassment at having to ask, &quot;make me
come, please!&quot;

&quot;Beg,&quot; Diana&#39;s voice was a whisper.

Lewdly Luan thrust her hips up, &quot;Please Mistress, I
beg of you!&quot;

Diana&#39;s laugher was soft in the bedroom, &quot;I thought
you&#39;d never ask.&quot; With that she brought her lips to
the slick skin, not seeing the eyes filled with a mix
of raw desire and pure hatred that stared down at her.
