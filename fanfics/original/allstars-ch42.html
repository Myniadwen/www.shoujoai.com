4:55 am

 

Gardenia Kemper was having a lovely dream until her cell phone woke her 
up. She ignored it after the first few rings, but the annoying siren 
came back for revenge soon after. Lazily she flung her arm out, reaching 
across her dresser, knocking her radio alarm clock and lamp over onto 
the carpet. Cords were compromised and the power was shut off; Gardenia 
mumbled and tumbled out of bed, crawling along the floor. She forgot 
that her cell phone was in her jacket, and her glasses in the bathroom, 
as always. She rubbed her face and picked it up.

&quot;What?&quot; she said groggily, recognizing the number as Lau&#39;s. &quot;Jeez, 
it&#39;s...five in the morning.&quot;

&quot;Miss Kemper, I&#39;m just calling in to tell you I can&#39;t make it today. I 
have to be at the airport by seven. My grandparents are coming into town 
and I&#39;m the only one available to pick them up.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; she yawned, &quot;I remember you telling me that. Sure, take a few 
days off. You&#39;ve...uhh...huah! Scuse&#39; me. You&#39;ve earned it.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, I appreciate it. Are you going to be all right at Lily today? I 
mean, Miss Khovansky and Miss Velur aren&#39;t going to be there either.&quot;

&quot;Relax, Lau, this isn&#39;t my first barbecue, okay? I&#39;ll do just fine on my 
own. Say hi to everyone for me. Hey, maybe you can bring them by later 
and I can treat them.&quot;

&quot;Yeah right!&quot; Lau snorted. &quot;They&#39;re Malaysian, Miss Kemper! As in, 
traditional! They have no idea I work there! They think I&#39;m still at 
that art museum! If any of them found out I work with...well, you know. 
I don&#39;t mean any offense...&quot;

&quot;I get the picture, all right? I won&#39;t say a word. Anyway, have fun.&quot; 
She could practically hear the grimace Lau made, and smirked as she hung 
up. But soon that smirk turned into a whine, and Gardenia rubbed her 
face as she tried to figure out how she was going to get out of this 
one. But since she was awake, she figured she might as well take a 
shower, get dressed, and head on over to work.

&quot;God, I need more employees,&quot; she hissed.

 

&quot;The Gardenia &amp; Robin Super Happy Fun Time Hour&quot;

 

After putting on her &quot;Suffering Sappho-tash!&quot; shirt and stuffing all her 
necessities into a duffel bag that read &quot;Infinite Holding&quot;, Gardenia 
locked up and got into her car. Dawn had not yet broken when she arrived 
at the quite little caf&eacute; she owned and operated; the weather was growing 
chilly and her skin prickled in response. Faint puffs of fog flew from 
her lips as she breathed, and as she unlocked the doors and quickly 
turned on the lobby lights, she rubbed her arms and fingers. It wouldn&#39;t 
be long before she would be forced to trade in her beloved short sleeves 
for something warmer.

There were multiple light switches, knobs, and levers that had to be 
turned, flipped, and pushed throughout the Lily Club; Gardenia was 
mainly concerned with the main breaker, which required considerably more 
effort to activate. She wanted her customers to adjust the lighting to 
their tastes, and so usually didn&#39;t fool with them individually. Once 
everything was brighter, Gardenia performed a quick spot-cleaning of the 
place, and made sure the coffee was fresh and the rolls were hot and 
ready. She completed her morning ritual by sliding off the catch that 
kept the front doors from opening, flicked the neon sign on, and turned 
on the music station- something subdued and relaxing for the early 
hours. It was 5:52 in the morning.

Gardenia slumped her head down on the counter wearily.

 

1: Two Flowers

People didn&#39;t usually come into the caf&eacute; until 7:00, and then at a 
trickle. Until then, population was sparse at best, too quiet and 
contemplative, or in too much of a hurry, to speak with the owner or 
keep her entertained. Robin wouldn&#39;t arrive at Parody until 8:00, and 
Odessa wouldn&#39;t even be awake for hours. That meant that Gardenia had 
about two hours to occupy herself until something more exciting came 
along. Fortunately, since she considered Lily to be her second home- she 
spent more time there than at her house, and rarely took days off- there 
was plenty to do. At least, under normal circumstances, there would be 
plenty to do, but her morning shift employees were all out of town. 
Gardenia started by making sure the place was clean, even though her 
evening shift workers mopped up the caf&eacute; pretty well every day before it 
closed.

First she treated herself to a crepe suzette and slipped a movie into 
one of the televisions scattered around. Tonight&#39;s features were Gojira 
and Clerks- an odd combination, certainly- but she saved those for 
later; she watched Porco Rosso instead. After she finished her 
breakfast, Gardenia made herself a cappuccino and absorbed herself in 
the film.

&quot;Ah, Michael Keaton,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Is there anything you can&#39;t do? I 
mean, Christian Bale was the better Batman, no mistake, but you bring 
such a quirky charm to your work. Hey, good morning!&quot; She waved at her 
first customer of the day, a heavyset butch with a Mohawk, her face 
covered with rings and studs.

&quot;Hey,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Can I have like an expresso and a slice of apple 
cinnamon pie?&quot;

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; she said, rising from her seat.

&quot;Sorry I made ya move,&quot; she grinned. Gardenia smiled brightly.

&quot;Nah, I was bored stiff. Hardly anybody comes in here this early. You 
aren&#39;t in any hurry, are you? The pie might take awhile.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what she said,&quot; she joked. Gardenia smirked and made the 
espresso (much too relaxed to bother correcting the woman&#39;s 
pronunciation). Lily Club pies came refrigerated so they&#39;d last, and 
they were usually sliced, baked, and sold immediately upon request, 
unless someone asked for a whole one. There was a microwave at the caf&eacute;, 
but Gardenia rarely used it for customers; she preferred the oven.

&quot;What&#39;s that you were watching?&quot; the woman said, raising her espresso to 
the TV screen. &quot;Saturday morning cartoons?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an anime film. Miyazaki productions. Uh...ever heard of Spirited 
Away?&quot; The woman shook her head. &quot;Hmm. Princess Mononoke? Nausicaa? 
Howl&#39;s Moving Castle? Hmm. Anyway, it&#39;s about a World War one pilot 
who&#39;s apparently under this curse that makes him look like a pig. It&#39;s 
pretty decent.&quot;

&quot;Huh, sounds weird. Is it a Disney film?&quot;

&quot;No, Studio Ghibli. They&#39;ve produced some of their work to American 
audiences through Disney, though. All right, umm...looks like it&#39;s gonna 
be five more minutes for the pie. Can I get you anything else?&quot;

&quot;Nah, I&#39;m just stopping by from my night shift. I need a snack before I 
head home.&quot;

&quot;I hear that. You live around here?&quot;

&quot;No, commuter. About forty-five minutes away.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well, if you&#39;re in the area again, try our crepe suzettes.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; she shrugged. &quot;So like, why is this placed called 
the Lily Club? Is it some kind of floral caf&eacute; place?&quot;

&quot;No, just an homage to Japanese lesbians. Long story.&quot; The woman gave 
her a peculiar look. Finally her pie came out, hot and fresh. She took a 
bite and was amazed.

&quot;Damn, that&#39;s good! Did you make these?&quot;

&quot;No, we buy them from a bakery. It&#39;s made from natural ingredients.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I can tell. So like is this really a dyke caf&eacute;?&quot;

&quot;We offer sanctuary for women when times become perilous,&quot; Gardenia 
proclaimed theatrically, &quot;but there&#39;s nothing that says men aren&#39;t 
allowed. They just don&#39;t come in here often.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well, thanks for the stuff. Take it easy.&quot;

&quot;Sure, you too.&quot; Gardenia wiped the counter and cleaned the coffee 
machine to occupy herself as the film continued. She was about to return 
to her seat and relax when three other women came in, yawning and 
bleary-eyed. &quot;Hey there! Have a seat and relax.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re in a hurry,&quot; they said. Gardenia tried not to look puzzled. Now 
what kind of a person was in a rush on a Saturday morning? Honestly, 
now... &quot;Can we have three coffees, with sugar and cream? And do you have 
any muffins?&quot;

&quot;Sure, what kind?&quot;

&quot;Do you have banana nut?&quot;

&quot;That and then some,&quot; she said, pointing to the caf&eacute;&#39;s main menu. They 
could be forgiven for their lack of observation- after all, it was still 
fairly early. &quot;How do you want them?&quot; she asked as she pulled a box from 
the refrigerator: &quot;Cold, warm, piping hot?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re fine. We&#39;ll eat them later. Thanks.&quot; The women left as quickly 
as they came, leaving Kemper to sigh. She was so bored and lonely...

 

2: Erithacus rubecula

Robin Granveldt, her focus hazy and her march in tune to a song playing 
through her headphones, needed to look up only once on her way to work. 
Unlike a certain someone she had been acquainted with since her shop 
opened up, Robin did not have the luxury of driving to work, nor did she 
have the spacious dwellings her friend boasted- but then again, she 
didn&#39;t have to wake up before five o&#39;clock every morning, she could walk 
to work since she lived only two blocks away, her rent was cheaper, and 
she could take more days off. She looked up to see a bit of steam 
curling from the Lily Club&#39;s vents, and could smell the cinnamon and the 
rolls and pastries and cakes and coffees wafting out into a cloudy 
perfume. She unlocked her store, turned on the lights, took a peek 
around to make sure nobody had broken in (or they had, that they at 
least had the courtesy to tell her about it), then closed shop once 
more, hanging a sign that irresponsibly said, &quot;Store Closed until I feel 
like opening it again. Sincerely, management.&quot;

She walked into the Lily Club smugly and hungrily, noticing her longtime 
friend and occasional lover glued to one of the caf&eacute;&#39;s television sets, 
eating something bite-sized and undoubtedly bad for her. She went behind 
the counter without saying a word and plucked out a muffin, slipping it 
into the microwave. Robin had just turned the coffee machine on when her 
hostess finally took notice of her.

&quot;No booty call discounts.&quot;

&quot;Tit for tat. Want anything while I&#39;m up here?&quot;

&quot;Orange juice. There&#39;s a glass in the fridge. Help yourself. Come here, 
sit down. I&#39;m just about finished.&quot; Robin brought Gardenia her glass and 
pulled a chair. They grinned at each other and made a toast to 
irresponsible behavior. &quot;Man, I hate coming here on Saturday mornings. 
It&#39;s so fucking dead, and the people that do come in are all asshole 
losers!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re more eloquent than usual,&quot; Robin smirked. &quot;Did someone slip 
Ritalin into your Red Bull this morning?&quot; Gardenia scoffed.

&quot;I wish. I get some stereotype dyke who&#39;s one flannel shirt away from 
giving chicks like us a bad name, some goofball retards who won&#39;t sit 
down for three seconds because they think being late to some meeting or 
whatever will destroy them, and another bunch of guys protesting this 
place.&quot;

&quot;Wow, and it&#39;s not even eight-thirty yet. I&#39;m impressed, Dee.&quot; Gardenia 
grunted and reclined further in her seat, nearly toppling over. She 
turned the TV off and ejected the disc. &quot;Well, just to make you feel 
better, not all is wine and roses at the Granveldt estate, either.&quot;

&quot;Do tell. You know how I love hearing about other people&#39;s miserable 
lives.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got it easy!&quot; Robin chuckled darkly. &quot;Even with those soccer 
pals of yours away on their game- oh, shit, that reminds me, it&#39;s being 
broadcast on some cable network later today. Do you think we could 
pirate something and watch it?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need to avast anything, landlubbers. I&#39;ve got it all worked 
out. You were saying something about Kitty and Perky?&quot;

&quot;Well I- &quot; Robin interrupted herself to grin at her friend&#39;s nicknames 
for Felicity and Nadia. &quot;I was just saying that with those two gone, you 
still have Lau, and...wasn&#39;t it one other person? You just got a new 
employee in that I haven&#39;t met.&quot;

&quot;Louise,&quot; she answered. &quot;She doesn&#39;t come in until Monday. I hired her 
for morning shift on weekdays since Perky and Kitty are at school.&quot;

&quot;Well, you still have Lau,&quot; Robin gestured. &quot;That&#39;s my whole point. You 
have more people, and I only have Terra and Fausta.&quot;

&quot;Hot Ass and Ghibli,&quot; Gardenia grinned lewdly. &quot;I&#39;ve been giving all the 
girls on Carnegie&#39;s team nicknames.&quot; Robin was amazed but hardly 
surprised.

&quot;Evidently. Is this what you spend your free time doing?&quot;

&quot;Hey, I gotta fill the void. Like I said, until my sweet little bird 
showed up, it was nothing but losers here. I could&#39;ve watched the 
extended edition of Return of the King and wouldn&#39;t miss a thing.&quot;

&quot;I am delighted to be of distraction for you,&quot; Robin bowed.

&quot;But you&#39;re wrong about something,&quot; Gardenia gestured.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have Lau today.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Nope. She&#39;s out of town visiting relatives.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s cool. Maybe she could invite them over. Family discount.&quot;

&quot;No can do, they&#39;re backwards Malaysian hillbillies.&quot;

&quot;What? No. Get the hell outta here!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m serious!&quot;

&quot;Do they know where their daughter works?&quot;

&quot;They think she&#39;s still over at that art museum, and for her sake, she 
better not have burned any bridges, if you know what I mean.&quot;

&quot;Oh wow, that sounds like something from an independent film. &#39;My 
Malaysian daughter works at a semi-lesbian caf&eacute; and we don&#39;t know about 
it because we&#39;re traditional Asians who want to arrange a marriage for 
her.&#39;&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re pretty fuckin&#39; accurate,&quot; Gardenia snickered. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
about the marriage deal, but you&#39;ve got the rest pegged. Except for all 
we know, Lau&#39;s as straight as I used to be before you seduced me.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Robin squealed as she slapped her friend&#39;s arm. &quot;You were 
giving off these lesbo-vibes the moment we first met! If anything, Miss 
Flower Girl, your wily charms got the better of me and I decided to make 
the first move so we&#39;d get all that sexual tension out of the way!&quot;

&quot;What wily charms?&quot;

&quot;Your wily Flower Girl charms you throw around.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s for work and work alone.&quot;

&quot;Unless you visit me at Parody.&quot;

&quot;Because we&#39;re friends.&quot;

&quot;Do you flirt with your friends?&quot;

&quot;No! Do you?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes.&quot; Robin paused uncomfortably and added, &quot;I flirt with Jenny.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and guess who has the most video games between the two of us.&quot;

&quot;You pig!&quot; she exclaimed incredulously. &quot;I&#39;m not getting a discount from 
her!&quot;

&quot;You get free coffee and snacks from me whenever you like.&quot;

&quot;And who spends half her time with her nose in a comic book when she 
ought to be working?&quot; The Lily Club door opened while the women were 
debating: people were beginning to stream in regularly now. Robin 
clucked her tongue. &quot;Saved by the bell, you are. Listen, Dee, if you 
don&#39;t stop being so charming, I&#39;m going to have to confront you about 
this.&quot; The two scrambled to their feet, Gardenia hastily swallowing the 
rest of her juice.

&quot;How are you going to confront me? Hey, ladies, come on in! Cool, you 
brought some guys around! Relax, stay awhile, have some fun! Yes, yes, 
men can come in here, too. Settle in, fellows. Don&#39;t be afraid to do 
something feminine now and then.&quot; Gardenia got back behind the counter, 
and Robin joined her. They took orders together and started baking, 
occasionally exchanging words.

 

3: Pollination

&quot;Well?&quot; Kemper said during a short break.

&quot;Well what?&quot;

&quot;How are you going to confront me and my wily lesbian charms? Hey, great 
to see you! Sure, go ahead and turn it on! Here&#39;s the remote.&quot;

&quot;In the usual place,&quot; Robin answered simply. She smiled mysteriously and 
added, &quot;But maybe not in the usual style.&quot;

&quot;Spontaneity has been the key to our success,&quot; Gardenia admitted. &quot;Okay, 
here&#39;s your cinnamon rolls. Some napkins...and a bottle of milk. Thanks- 
enjoy it! Here: the fruits of our labor.&quot; She dipped her finger into 
cinnamon icing and placed it on Robin&#39;s lips. Robin&#39;s eyes smoldered as 
she drew the sugary confection into her mouth and suckled it.

&quot;Mmn, tastes good. Especially since you mostly sat on your ass all 
morning.&quot;

&quot;And yet you haven&#39;t even opened your store. There&#39;s probably fifteen 
people there right now with a battering ram.&quot;

&quot;Bah, nobody comes to Parody on Saturday until ten o&#39;clock.&quot;

&quot;Except us,&quot; she grinned. When she had the opportunity, Gardenia glanced 
around and noticed that nobody was paying the order kiosk any special 
attention. She took Robin by the wrist, gesturing for the back door she 
used when she wanted to sneak out unseen. Normally, she would never 
attempt to leave her store for long without someone to watch over it, 
but today...

&quot;Wait,&quot; Robin said, noticing her friend&#39;s anxious gaze. &quot;You want to go 
now?&quot;

&quot;No time like the present. Not unless you think you can handle more of 
my charms.&quot; Not one to back down or show indecisiveness (or worst yet- 
responsibility!), Robin eagerly followed, keeping an eye out for anybody 
watching their exit. The path was cleared and they were soon outside. 
Even though they were not traveling very fast, both women were quite 
exhilarated at what they were doing.

&quot;This is a new level of slacking off for you,&quot; Granveldt grinned 
giddily. &quot;I&#39;m almost lightheaded!&quot;

&quot;So I guess you won&#39;t be up to task, huh?&quot; Gardenia&#39;s eyes sparkled; she 
was glowing with the thrill of the escape.

&quot;I&#39;ll try my best, Dee. Whew! There, see? Nobody in front with a 
battering ram.&quot; She flipped the sign so that it read &quot;Open&quot;, unlocked 
the door and slipped inside, turned on a neon light, and quickly dashed 
to the basement, still clasping onto her partner. Robin and Gardenia 
were spastic with adrenaline and hormones; they were laughing wildly as 
they wrestled in Parody&#39;s spacious basement. Soon Robin gained the upper 
hand and threw her best friend and lover onto a bean bag chair, then 
dove in after her, purring hungrily.

&quot;You smell heavenly,&quot; she whispered as she kissed and nibbled. Gardenia 
sighed warmly as she felt gentle hands clasp her bosom, lips touching 
her neck, igniting her pulse, and fingers digging deep- rubbing, 
touching, penetrating. She gasped and jumped as the beginnings of that 
ultimate sensation brought her sweet promises.

And then a customer came. &quot;Hello? I&#39;m ready to order now. Is there 
anybody here? The store says &#39;open&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Robin hissed, bailing out sourly. &quot;Some people have the worst 
timing.&quot;

&quot;Just ignore him!&quot; Gardenia begged, her eyes desperate and her breath 
short. &quot;Please, Robin...god...not now.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, honey flower. I&#39;ll make it up to you.&quot;

&quot;Hey, wait- where are you going? Robin! Don&#39;t make me charm you back 
here! Rob- shit!&quot; Gardenia zipped up her jeans and followed her friend 
to the top, where a patient man awaited with a stack of books in his 
arms. They both put on the act without missing a beat.

&quot;Sorry for the wait. Will you be needing anything else?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no thanks, this will do. This is a really great store, you know.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she smiled cordially, &quot;I get that all the time.&quot;

&quot;I mean, there&#39;s stuff here I&#39;d never be able to find anywhere else. I&#39;m 
actually pretty surprised something that&#39;s this small and out of the way 
carries this kind of selection.&quot;

&quot;Rare and unique books,&quot; Robin said, referring to Parody&#39;s slogan.

&quot;I know. So why&#39;s it called Parody, anyway? I pass by here all the time 
but I never could figure it out. Does it have something to do with 
jokes?&quot;

&quot;I just thought it was a cool name. Thirty-seven fifty-three, please.&quot; 
He gave her his debit card with a look of surprise.

&quot;So you own it?&quot;

&quot;Yep, bought and paid for. I get to name it and I get to say when it&#39;s 
open and when it&#39;s not.&quot;

&quot;Wow, that must&#39;ve cost a fortune.&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; she shrugged. &quot;I bought this place back when the economy 
was bad and demand was low. It was next to nothing. I spent most of my 
money fixing it up and arranging all the standard contracts.&quot;

&quot;Huh. So what&#39;s that like?&quot;

&quot;As boring as it sounds,&quot; she replied evenly. She gave him his receipt 
and he signed another copy. &quot;Thanks so much. Come back again sometime.&quot;

&quot;Uh, sure. So what&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Gardenia,&quot; said Robin with a little smirk. &quot;Gardenia Kemper.&quot; Gardenia, 
who had been wandering around browsing the CD section, couldn&#39;t help but 
snigger. Sometimes they assumed each other&#39;s identities and even worked 
each other&#39;s jobs; the anonymity gave them a rush not unlike playing 
hooky or having sex during business hours.

&quot;Whoa, cool name! Listen, um, I&#39;m kinda busy this weekend, but do you 
think maybe you could take some time off and we could hang somewhere? 
There&#39;s this concert coming into town and I was...um, well, you know.&quot;

&quot;I do know about that!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I actually have tickets...and a 
date. Sorry.&quot; She hissed awkwardly; he took it fairly well.

&quot;Oh, no worries. Just thought I&#39;d ask. Anyway, maybe we&#39;ll see each 
other there.&quot;

&quot;Amidst thousands,&quot; she smiled doubtfully.

&quot;You never know. I&#39;ll see you around, Gardenia!&quot; He waved; she couldn&#39;t 
help but grin. The real Gardenia came out several seconds later, holding 
a soundtrack album.

&quot;Wow. You get people asking you out on dates a lot?&quot;

&quot;Often enough. I know, it&#39;s weird! They&#39;re mostly perfect strangers, 
too.&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;m not the only one with charm around here,&quot; she grinned. 
Robin smiled smarmily and pointed to her friend&#39;s possession.

&quot;Are you actually going to buy something, or am I going to have to burn 
another CD?&quot;

&quot;Huh? No, just browsing. So...can we pick up where we left off?&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;d better check up on Lily first,&quot; she sang. Gardenia rolled 
her eyes and grumbled.

&quot;Urgh, right. I&#39;ll see you later, okay? Don&#39;t be a stranger!&quot;

&quot;You too,&quot; she called. Robin sighed drearily as she watched her friend 
leave. &quot;Waste of a perfectly fine ass.&quot;

 

4: Football is Un-American

&quot;They&#39;re playing the men&#39;s game first,&quot; Gardenia said, squeezing her 
cell phone between her shoulder and ear. &quot;Yeah, and the women&#39;s right 
after. Uh, let&#39;s see. It says here that the guys are going against 
Redwood Private Academy and the women have St. Thekla&#39;s. ...Yeah, I 
don&#39;t know where they come up with these names, either. ...Well sure. I 
mean, it&#39;s not going to be the same, but I&#39;ll definitely keep it on. 
Someone might want to see it. ...Hahahaha! Am I really that gay? You&#39;re 
the one who&#39;d burst in there while they&#39;re all showering together and 
take photos. ...Oh yeah, I guess you would. Speaking of video cameras, 
do you still have yours? ...Well, I was thinking of putting on a talent 
show, and thought that maybe we could record it. ...Um, November. Like 
the first Sunday of November. I don&#39;t have my calendar with me, so I 
don&#39;t... Hold on, let me check.&quot;

She put her phone down, completed another order, and flipped the caf&eacute;&#39;s 
personalized calendar over a month. &quot;It&#39;s going to be the fourth. 
...Yeah, that&#39;s right after that convention. ...Robin, I am not working 
here while there&#39;s a convention in town! Do you realize how often we 
have those here? ...Exactly! ...I dunno, maybe Lau and Louise could 
work. I&#39;ll have to ask Kitty and Perky if there&#39;s interested or not. 
Anyway, talent show on the fourth. ...Yeah, I&#39;ll make fliers and 
everything. Say, are you coming over to watch the game? ...All right. 
Listen, if you can&#39;t make it, I&#39;ll tell you how it went. ...I will. And 
I&#39;ll keep an eye on Kitty and Perky, too. Okay, I guess I&#39;ll see you 
when I see you. Love ya, babe. ...Hahaha! Bye.&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; she said as she slid over to her next customer. &quot;I 
needed to call my buddy in Parody about the game. We both have employees 
on the women&#39;s team, so we try to watch as many as we can.&quot;

&quot;Women&#39;s team?&quot; the girl said, blinking in confusion.

&quot;Yeah. The women&#39;s soccer team for the local college.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t even know there was a college here,&quot; she admitted stiffly. 
Gardenia snorted.

&quot;You been living under a rock?&quot;

&quot;No. I&#39;m not from around here.&quot;

&quot;Oh. I guess that&#39;s excusable. Anyway, my friend and I have employees 
that go to Carnegie- that&#39;s the local college here- and they&#39;re also on 
the women&#39;s soccer team. There&#39;s a men&#39;s game on right now if you want 
to watch.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not really into sports, and I think soccer is boring.&quot;

&quot;Well, I know, and I feel the same, but you gotta watch your friends. 
It&#39;s actually pretty engaging once you get into it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give it a glance.&quot; She picked up her order and returned to her 
table, leaving Gardenia to juggle a swarm of people flooding Lily. 
Weekends were the biggest hits for the caf&eacute;, so Gardenia normally asked 
all her employees to come in. Unfortunately, Nadia and Felicity were out 
of town and wouldn&#39;t be back until later, just in time to help with 
Saturday evening movies. Gardenia had put a &quot;help wanted&quot; sign outside 
and even advertised in the paper, but she hadn&#39;t seen any serious 
applicants yet. But she was tough; she could hold down the fort, at 
least for awhile.

The front door suddenly burst open and a voice shouted: &quot;Fucking 
dykes!!&quot; It closed just as quickly and Gardenia made a bewildered face. 
The woman closest to her mirrored that expression perfectly. &quot;Wait, is 
this like a gay bar or something?&quot;

&quot;No...people are just stupid. You see a sign that says &#39;sanctuary for 
women&#39; and assume all kinds of crazy things. Oy...I should employ a few 
men just to prove this isn&#39;t some women&#39;s-only club.&quot;

&quot;But...lesbians do come here, right? I mean, it&#39;s sort of themed around 
them, isn&#39;t it? I mean, you&#39;re gay, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Gay and proud, but that&#39;s just me. I can&#39;t control how other people 
believe and live their lives. This is a place where all people can relax 
and where women can let their hair down and relax, but I&#39;m not excluding 
men. We raise our cups in Lily, not our fists.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, so you&#39;re a dyke? Gross! God, I can&#39;t believe I was in some 
fucking dyke bar!&quot;

&quot;The door&#39;s over there, sweetheart,&quot; she pointed curtly. &quot;I&#39;ll have to 
ask you to leave with that language.&quot;

&quot;Fine! Fucking faggots!&quot; Gardenia wasn&#39;t the type to get into a foul 
mood easily, but stupid small-minded ignorant people like those men and 
this woman really steamed her. She chased after the girl and shouted to 
her.

&quot;A faggot is a bundle of sticks, asshole! And a dyke is 
something...to...dam up water and...aw, screw it.&quot; She ignored the looks 
pedestrians were giving her and sulked her way inside. One of her 
beloved regulars put arms around her and squeezed gently.

&quot;Only you would run outside in broad daylight screaming something like 
that. Don&#39;t let it get to you, honey. They&#39;re closed off in their dull, 
grey little worlds while we get to be here. Okay?&quot; She kissed her 
forehead and Gardenia thanked her. People ignored the men&#39;s game for the 
most part (they lost) and interest didn&#39;t raise very much when the 
women&#39;s match came on. Gardenia cheered for her girls, but she mostly 
cheered alone.

&quot;They work here, you know,&quot; she grinned proudly. Another regular took 
notice and approached the television.

&quot;Hey, she&#39;s right! That&#39;s Nadia! That&#39;s that cute Russian chick! 
Shelley, that&#39;s that girl I told you about! Look!&quot;

&quot;Cool,&quot; Shelley said as she joined her friend. More people were being 
drawn into the game, but only because they recognized Nadia, not because 
they were actually interested in soccer, or Carnegie, or (saddest of 
all) Felicity. One or two also knew of the exploits of Shannon Wilson, 
and soon there was a buzz going about. Business exploded as people made 
new orders for food and drink, and poor Gardenia was nearly ran ragged. 
She was saved by grace as Robin strolled in, smiling, and walked up to 
kiss her cheek.

&quot;I missed you! Busy day?&quot;

&quot;Hectic. I&#39;m thinking I shouldn&#39;t&#39;ve turned the game on. Now everybody&#39;s 
watching.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s a bad thing?&quot;

&quot;No, but the line for orders is half a mile long! Please help me out, 
sweetie.&quot; Robin chuckled as Gardenia pulled out the puppy-dog eyes.

&quot;It&#39;s the least I can do after you put me out of business. Nobody&#39;s 
coming to Parody now. Don&#39;t worry, I put up a sign. We won&#39;t see any 
battering-rams today.&quot;

 

5: Succubus

Odessa Beill woke up at 1:00 in the afternoon every day and loved her 
life more than anyone she knew, with the possible exception of a certain 
Flower Girl and Bird. Not only did she own and operate her own business- 
just like her contemporaries- but she was doing exactly what she wanted 
with her life, could make her own schedules, answered to no higher 
authority (besides her parents), and devoted her life expressly to love, 
romance, and adventure- again, like her companions. Unlike the two 
younger women, however, Odessa was single and had no attachments to any 
lover- but this was her choice and her belief, and she would stay that 
way until she was convinced there was something even better.

Odessa didn&#39;t believe in long-term relationships. She had made love to 
many women (and women only), and had always felt something towards them, 
yet she always concluded the relationship before it could become stale 
and stagnant. Odessa loved getting to know people and loved being around 
them, and she was all for the congress and copulation of lovers; she 
just didn&#39;t think anybody could hang onto one person for very long, 
unless it was out of habit or necessity. She scoffed when the religious 
right claimed that homosexuality would be the downfall of marriage; 
adultery and divorce took care of that millennia ago. Instead, she 
preferred being with a person only as long as both parties were 
interested- or rather, interesting. She didn&#39;t like being tied down and, 
with only two exceptions, had never honestly been in real love. Odessa 
would have nothing to do with &quot;slutty&quot; behavior; she preferred to be 
called a romantic.

When she woke up that morning, took a shower, ate her breakfast, and got 
dressed- in that order- there was no romantic partner by her side, nor 
had there been for some time. The last one had terminated their 
relationship due to &quot;outside conflict&quot;: with my schedule, she said, we 
wouldn&#39;t be able to keep it up for long. It was fun while it lasted, 
but...

&quot;You don&#39;t have to say anything else,&quot; Odessa had said with an 
understanding grin. &quot;I know exactly what you mean. We&#39;ll just cut our 
losses and count our blessings. But if you ever have some free time, 
stop on by for awhile. Out and About won&#39;t be the same without you.&quot;

As Odessa made her daily drive to Parody and Lily to see her favorite 
patrons, she wished with all her heart that one of her employees, a 
buxom young woman with a silvery streak in her dark hair, would come of 
age soon and join everyone on the main floor. Odessa liked Kasumi a lot, 
but she would be of better service amidst the crowds, flirting and 
serving drinks. Her talents were being put to waste in that disastrous 
office (although to be fair, she had tidied it up well). Odessa couldn&#39;t 
count the number of times she had stared longingly at the younger woman, 
or how many times she wondered if Kasumi would be at all interested in 
her. She didn&#39;t think of herself as anybody&#39;s &quot;boss&quot;; the title sounded 
so ugly. Gardenia and Robin certainly bucked the office, and they seemed 
to have a great rapport with their employees. Now if only she could 
convince Kasumi to see past all that...

Breakfast service had ended when she finally reached the Lily, and the 
gang was busy watching a soccer match on TV. It was Carnegie versus St. 
Thekla&#39;s, and interest was surprisingly high. Odessa knew that most of 
the people that came to her nightclub were in the post-college crowd, 
and seeing as how she recognized a few old friends, she didn&#39;t think 
they&#39;d pay much attention to a small college sports team. She had to 
remind herself never to underestimate the value of familiar faces: a lot 
of women were starting to recognize Kasumi and Fausta, and one had even 
put a name to Felicity&#39;s face.

&quot;Oh my god, that goalie is so hot!&quot; she heard one girl say. &quot;What was 
her name? Elincia? Oh, Valencia. Wow, she&#39;s good. And that tall girl, 
uh...Howlet? Anybody know her? Right, Rain Howlet. She&#39;s really limber!&quot;

&quot;Ohmygosh, I recognize her from the fencing team! That&#39;s that girl from 
the fencing team!&quot;

&quot;Hey, it is! She&#39;s sexy!&quot;

&quot;She sure is,&quot; Odessa purred. She watched Shannon attack St. Thekla&#39;s 
defense, paying special attention to her firm legs. Odessa was somewhat 
indiscriminate with her women.

&quot;Hey, gorgeous!&quot; she heard a familiar voice chirp. Odessa smiled and 
sauntered over to the front counter, where she met two exhausted best 
friends. &quot;About time you showed up. Help us out here, will you? We&#39;ve 
been swamped.&quot;

&quot;Hello to you too, Granveldt! Where&#39;s that cute little Asian girl that 
works here?&quot;

&quot;Off with family,&quot; Gardenia said. &quot;Come on, step over. A little hard 
labor isn&#39;t going to kill you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather not leave that to chance,&quot; Odessa laughed. &quot;So do I get a 
discount or something if I help?&quot;

&quot;Free lunch,&quot; Gardenia offered.

&quot;Plus all the women to flirt with you can handle.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, very tempting. Maybe we can discuss something a little better 
soon. Okay, so what do I do?&quot;

&quot;Run the register, please. The price guide&#39;s right there in front of 
you. Don&#39;t flirt too much, and, um...oh! Hand out fliers for the movie 
night tonight.&quot;

&quot;Sounds thrilling,&quot; she groaned.

&quot;Better than being stuck at Parody,&quot; Robin sighed. &quot;You know, you two 
are very cruel, stealing all my customers away.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the &#39;smart&#39; one, though,&quot; Gardenia said, pointing to Robin&#39;s 
outfit. She had on a skirt that went to her knees, hosiery, heels, a 
dark blue vest, and a pink sweater- altogether a very 
professional-looking ensemble. Odessa&#39;s midriff was exposed and she was 
wearing shorts- and Gardenia, of course, has already been discussed. 
&quot;People go to your store to get intellectual stimulation. That&#39;s why I&#39;m 
always there.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s not to flirt with me?&quot; she smirked.

&quot;You&#39;re the one who flirts!&quot; she snorted. &quot;I&#39;m in it for the 
scientifical aspect and stuff.&quot;

&quot;Well, what do people come here for? Naturally, they go to Odessa&#39;s 
because it&#39;s sexy...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m the fun one,&quot; she replied cheerfully. &quot;I&#39;m the one wearing goofy 
shirts and playing movies. You two really need to lighten up.&quot;

&quot;Maybe after you expand your mind,&quot; Robin moaned playfully.

&quot;Or your legs,&quot; Odessa added with a wink. That brought their 
conversation to a standstill. The next customer in line blanched.

&quot;Um, so, what&#39;s that about playing movies again?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t mind the cashier,&quot; Gardenia gestured. &quot;She&#39;s a temp worker.&quot;

&quot;Fuck you, flower girl,&quot; Odessa grinned. &quot;Can I help who&#39;s next in line, 
please? Oh, hey Betty! How ya doing, girl?&quot;

&quot;She is such a whore,&quot; Robin sighed as she watched Odessa kissing her 
customer. Gardenia put her arm around her and slid her free hand down to 
her bottom.

&quot;Don&#39;t be jealous, honey. We&#39;re living in sin too, remember?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah!&quot;

 

6: Household for Three

&quot;Where&#39;s your clock?&quot; Odessa wondered as she looked up during a lull. 
She had been to Lily enough times to know its basic layout, and was used 
to seeing a wall clock near the front, with two &quot;female&quot; symbols as the 
hands.

&quot;Something&#39;s broken on it,&quot; Gardenia grumbled. &quot;I had to take it into 
shop the other day and I haven&#39;t heard anything back. I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll 
get a discount because it&#39;s a Lesbian Clock.&quot;

&quot;Why do you think you&#39;ll get a discount?&quot;

&quot;Because whoever fixes it wouldn&#39;t dare overcharge me,&quot; she answered 
wryly. &quot;If I so much as whisper the word &#39;sexual discrimination&#39;, I 
could have a lawsuit on my hands. God bless a nation that allows people 
to sue others for something so ridiculous. Anyway, instead of risking 
it, I&#39;ll bet the thong I&#39;m wearing that I get a pretty decent cut. I&#39;m 
hoping, anyway.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll probably charge you the same flat rate he charges everybody,&quot; 
robin gestured. &quot;No muss, no fuss. Odessa, would you like a milkshake?&quot;

&quot;Sure! Did you get any new flavors?&quot;

&quot;Nope, still the same five.&quot;

&quot;Make it a peach, then. Are you buying, Robs?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, are you buying?&quot; Gardenia said, giving her a firm poke. &quot;Maybe I 
should collect that enormous tab of yours.&quot;

&quot;Just as soon as I get yours, lover,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;I don&#39;t have a tab! I just come in and borrow your stuff for awhile! 
It&#39;s not like I steal it.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t operate a library, honey buns. There you go, Odessa. What about 
you, Dee? Surely you can afford a free shake.&quot;

&quot;You know I pay for that stuff,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;But fine, whatever. More 
money out of my pockets. Cookies and cream, please.&quot;

&quot;You can afford it, sweetie,&quot; Robin giggled. &quot;You are richer than both 
of us put together. That&#39;s why you have that obscene penthouse with the 
pool.&quot;

&quot;That was a gift from mommy- and just be thankful I don&#39;t charge for its 
use...ya freeloader.&quot;

&quot;Both of you get weirder every time I see you,&quot; Odessa muttered. Still- 
Lily had the best shakes she knew of. When the three were finished, 
Odessa announced she&#39;d be going on a break, but first wrapped one arm 
around Gardenia&#39;s waist and whispered something into her ear. She kissed 
the woman&#39;s soft supple lobe, sucking softly, and blew into it gently 
before leaving. Gardenia had to remove her glasses to wipe the fog off.

&quot;A business deal, I take it,&quot; Robin said blandly.

&quot;If you say so,&quot; she grinned. Gardenia scampered away without hesitation 
or restraint, once again leaving the store&#39;s upkeep to chance. Robin 
decided she&#39;d give them a few minutes to themselves before pulling them 
back. Odessa was already down to her shorts and brassiere when Gardenia 
found her searching through the vending machine, so the younger woman 
snuck up on her and wrapped arms of desire around her naked tummy. 
Gardenia wasted no time and peppered Odessa&#39;s rich ochre skin with 
kisses: shoulders, neck, arms, hands, fingers, and the delicious 
muscular hills and valleys of her back, her glorious womanly back, naked 
and beautiful as it curved and soared. Her hands covered Odessa&#39;s soft 
breasts and caressed them, pinching and tickling her taut brown nipples, 
rubbing and lifting the supple underpart, squeezing gently until they 
had blossomed into full arousal. Odessa moved only briefly to remove 
Gardenia&#39;s jeans, using her sultry eyes to insist that she keep her 
shirt. Her bare bottom was out in full glory soon; Odessa yearned for 
its roundness as her warm lips found the epicenter of womanly delights.

It didn&#39;t take long for the young woman to reach orgasm; she muted her 
cries by burying her mouth first in Odessa&#39;s neck, then her lips. They 
kissed fiercely at first, rather mashing their mouths together, almost 
pushing each other with the force of their strength. Later, gradually, 
their affections softened, and what was once fire became silk instead, 
slick and smooth and delectable. Tongues leaped out and met; saliva was 
exchanged; sighs and breathless smiles were made. It wasn&#39;t until 
Gardenia turned around, by chance, that she happened to notice they were 
being watched- by Robin. She was smiling warmly, arms behind her back, 
and nude from head to toe.

&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Gardenia yawped with a laugh. &quot;You&#39;re completely naked!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t we have a knack for the obvious,&quot; Robin said warmly. She 
approached the two without a care in the world (of course, making sure 
the door was locked) and knelt down. &quot;I said I was going to make it up 
to you, didn&#39;t I?&quot; The two kissed passionately; Gardenia&#39;s breasts were 
bared in seconds.

&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; Odessa said. Robin purred as she pulled her shorts 
down and kissed everything she could. The dark-skinned woman said, &quot;Oh, 
that,&quot; before surrendering herself.

 

7: Twenty-four for one-hundred

&quot;So long, Rachel. Bye. Take care of yourself, Renee. Have a safe trip. 
Hey, it&#39;s been fun, Betty. You watch out for that Odessa, now! Kitty, 
Perky, you crazy kids stay out of trouble. Congrats again for winning 
that game! Is that it? Are we all clear? Okay, Lily old girl, time for 
you to sleep.&quot;

&quot;Do you always talk to the store when you lock up?&quot; Odessa said. 
Gardenia grinned.

&quot;No, just off-hand. Today was a pretty good day, wasn&#39;t it? I mean, this 
morning was awful, but...overall, it was pretty good.&quot;

&quot;What about tomorrow?&quot; Robin said. &quot;You said you were going to be hiring 
soon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m taking the day off tomorrow, actually,&quot; she said as she stretched. 
&quot;I&#39;ll let Kitty and Perky take care of the place. They owe me big time 
for all the days I let them practice. What about you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need to hire any more people.&quot;

&quot;I mean what are you going to do tomorrow? Why not come over and swim? 
It&#39;s been ages since we&#39;ve spent an entire day together.&quot;

&quot;Oh, do all those times we played hooky and visited each other not 
count?&quot;

&quot;Come on, you know what I mean. I miss being around you.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Robin sighed as she approached Parody. She locked up as well, 
making sure everything was in its proper place and not stolen (or if it 
was, that someone at least had the courtesy to tell her). &quot;I&#39;ve got a 
date tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Gardenia grinned. &quot;With who?&quot;

&quot;Jennifer, that girl from the team.&quot;

&quot;You mean Shorty?&quot; Robin chortled.

&quot;You really are immature, you know that?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, so? Is it so bad being young?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she answered serenely. &quot;And that&#39;s why I love you. ...Odessa, 
you&#39;ve been awfully quiet. Any plans for tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Go to work and go to bed until one in the afternoon,&quot; she answered 
breezily. &quot;Maybe one of you can join me. Dee, how about it?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t, I&#39;m wiped out. Uuhhh!&quot; She yawned loudly and stretched again. 
&quot;Damn! Who would&#39;ve thought I&#39;d be this tired at only...ten o&#39;clock at 
night? Woof, yikes! It&#39;s not my age, it&#39;s my workload.&quot;

&quot;You did work very hard today,&quot; Robin said as she drew her friend in for 
a kiss. Gardenia moaned softly and caressed Robin&#39;s body; Odessa walked 
away, feeling lonely.

&quot;Aaaaaanyway, I&#39;ll get back to the O and A. Kasumi&#39;ll clock out soon and 
someone needs to watch over the place. I can&#39;t slack off like you two.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s slacking off?!&quot; Robin wondered, feeling insulted.

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re the epitome of responsible behavior.&quot; The two best friends 
looked at each other, then snickered out loud before heading home. 
Another day, another dollar.
