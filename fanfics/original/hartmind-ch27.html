<a href="../original/hartmind-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>The group of girls were taken to the police station where they where 
asked a number of questions. Trish and Sam already worked out their 
response, telling the police that they went to see Star for her birthday 
when Star&#39;s father started shooting at them. After a short while their 
mothers arrived at the station with Beth. Diana rushed to Sam and Trish 
and hugged them tightly, while Mary-ann quickly moved to Star and 
checked the girl for wounds. 

&quot;Good god girls, you had me so worried.&quot; Diana said as she held the 
girls, &quot;What happened?&quot; She glanced around as an officer approached 
them. 

The officer tipped his hat at the women, &quot;I&#39;m guessing that you are the 
parents.&quot; He inquired glancing the three women. 

They all nodded and held their daughters to their sides. 

The officer smiled, &quot;You have some very brave girls.&quot; He said to Diana, 
&quot;They are heroes really, well heroines.&quot; He said as he corrected 
himself. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Diana demanded. 

The officer looked over his notes, &quot;I&#39;m not really sure entirely, but we 
got a call of mysterious man in the area which was quickly followed by 
calls of gun fire. Star&#39;s father was convinced that his daughter was a 
demon, keeps rambling on about Samantha here as well, and tried to kill 
the girl. Nearly did if it wasn&#39;t for Samantha&#39;s quick actions, she 
pulled the girl out of the line of fire and wrestled the gun from the 
man. I don&#39;t know how she did it, but it was something else that was for 
sure.&quot; 

Sam blushed as the man looked down at the girl proudly, &quot;I just didn&#39;t 
want him to hurt Star.&quot; She stated, hugging the girl in her arms. 

&quot;Well you don&#39;t have to worry about him anymore.&quot; The officer insisted, 
&quot;We have thirty or so witnesses who saw him shooting at two young girls. 
He is going away for a long time that is for certain.&quot; He assured the 
girls and Mary-ann sobbed into her sister&#39;s arms. 

Jasmine patted her sister&#39;s back and looked over at the officer, &quot;Can we 
go home now?&quot; she inquired curiously. 

He nodded and held out a card to the women, &quot;Sure thing, I think we got 
all we need from the girls, but if you wish to call me with any 
questions then feel free.&quot; He gave each one a card and tipped his cap 
one more time before turning to leave, &quot;I have to get to work now. You 
girls have a good day, and happy birthday to you two, Star and 
Samantha.&quot; He said with a smile, and then passed through a door at the 
back of the room. 

Jasmine glanced between the girls and smiled, &quot;Well should we be on our 
way?&quot; She inquired. 

The girls all nodded, wanting nothing more then to have then entire 
event behind them.

The group of them returned to Trish&#39;s place, all of them, not one sure 
what to say to the other. As Diana opened the door she and Jasmine 
suddenly stooped to pick up an armload of balloons each and tossed them 
at the girls. 

&quot;HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!&quot; They both cheered. The house had been covered in 
colourful streamers and a large banner covered the far wall, above the 
picture window with the words, &quot;Happy birthday Sam and Star.&quot; Written 
across it in a hasty scrawl that showed their mothers rushed things a 
little. Sam and Star both stood in the doorway in shock; neither of them 
prepared for the surprised that was planned for them. 

Trish and Beth moved around the girls, a broad grin upon both of their 
faces, &quot;Did we surprise you?&quot; They inquired already knowing the answer 
from the looks upon the two girl&#39;s faces. 

&quot;When did you have time to set this up?&quot; Sam inquired in awe of all the 
colours. 

Jasmine smiled, &quot;I had to come up with a way to get Mary-ann out of the 
house and all I could think of was telling asking her to help set up a 
surprise birthday party for the both of you.&quot; 

Mary-ann stared at her sister in shock, &quot;Get me out of the house? What 
are you talking about?&quot; 

Jasmine looked at the two mother&#39;s guilty and then down at the group of 
girls, &quot;Should we tell them?&quot; 

Trish nervously shifted her weight from foot to foot as she looked up at 
her mother, &quot;Mom, don&#39;t be angry with us... we had to save Star and her 
mother.&quot; 

Diana looked down at the girl with a puzzled look upon her face, &quot;What 
are you going on about?&quot; She glanced from one girl to another, stopping 
on Star&#39;s face. 

Star shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m as lost as the rest of you.&quot; She insisted, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what is going on either.&quot; She lied, her link with Sam filled 
her in on a years worth of details, but she was no ready to tell a 
stranger. 

Sam let out a sigh and stepped forward to stand in front of Diana, &quot;You 
remember those strange marks I got in the hospital?&quot; She inquired 
curiously. 

Diana nodded, &quot;Sure, the bullet woun-&quot; She brushed the girl&#39;s bangs back 
to find the scar had vanished and quickly checked the rest of the girl&#39;s 
body to find no other bullet scars, &quot;What happened to it?&quot; She glanced 
around at the group that stood around her, feeling like she was the only 
one left out of some strange joke. 

Jasmine lead the woman to the couch and lowered her into a seated 
position, &quot;It is a long and confusing story.&quot; She said with a nervous 
smile and glanced up at her sister, &quot;Sis, you might want to sit down for 
this too.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll stand.&quot; Mary-ann insisted, holding onto her daughter&#39;s shoulders 
for comfort. 

Jasmine took a deep breath and explained everything as best she could. 
When she got to the part about Mary-ann and Star&#39;s murders Diana brought 
her hands to her mouth as the pieces fell into place and she gazed over 
at Sam, reaching out for the girl to come to her. 

Reluctantly Sam approached the woman and was instantly pulled into the 
woman&#39;s arms, forced to sit on her lap as she was embraced in a warm 
hug, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Diana mumbled, &quot;I knew you were going through a lot 
of pain, I just didn&#39;t know how to help you.&quot; She said miserably, &quot;I&#39;m a 
horrible mother.&quot; 

Sam shook her head, &quot;You&#39;re the best mother I&#39;ve ever met.&quot; She glanced 
around the room at the other two women and smiled, &quot;All of you are.&quot; 

Jasmine set a hand upon the woman&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You did the best you 
could and that is all that counts.&quot; 

Mary-ann hugged Star, &quot;I&#39;m just glad you are all alright.&quot;

Diana nodded in agreement, then gave the girl&#39;s a stern look, &quot;Now I 
don&#39;t want to hear about you three chasing after mad murders again is 
that clear?&quot; 

The girls all nodded. 

Diana set her eyes upon Star, &quot;That goes for you too.&quot; She demanded. 

Star shrank into her mother&#39;s side and nodded. 

Diana patted Sam on the butt to her causing her to jump off her lap, 
&quot;Now who is for cake?&quot; She inquired with a smile.
