<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>There was a whistle, almost a loud screech as it cut
through the air then the rocket stuck home, exploding
in a sudden wash of heat and fire. The tattoo parlor
was swiftly engulfed in flames as the man dressed all
in black lowered his weapon, the rocket launcher
thumping to the ground as he smiled to himself in pure
satisfaction.

&quot;That was stupid,&quot; the voice seemed to boom out and
the blonde haired man jerked in surprise, looking
around wildly for where it was coming from.

The flames around the building faltered, swiftly
fading away before revealing a bizzare sight. The
tattoo parlor itself was utterly untouched, apparently
undamaged, while beside it the buildings were burned
and battered by the blast. Jess Drake stood in her
front door, her hands splattered with blood and her
expression murderous.

&quot;Shit,&quot; he cursed as he pulled out a pistol, leveling
it at her then freezing.

&quot;You really don&#39;t want to do that,&quot; Jess purred
dangerously, her black hair falling into her eyes, &quot;or
do you think that gun&#39;ll do better than your rocket
did?&quot;

He stood there, then lowered his gun reluctantly.
&quot;Looks like you live up to your reputation,&quot; he raised
his hands in surrender.

Jess strode through the remaining flames, simply
ignoring them as she quickly reached him and grabbed
him by the collar. &quot;Start explaining,&quot; she said coldly
as she yanked him roughly towards her, &quot;and make it
good.&quot;

&quot;Do you really think that I&#39;m going to reveal who sent
me?&quot; he asked her, his lips curling up in a mocking
smile.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m hoping you don&#39;t,&quot; Jess said with a chilling
kind of seriousness, &quot;at first. That way I can take
you into the back and get my knives out.&quot; She
continued on, &quot;Then I&#39;ll use my tattooing gear to
label you just like the scum that you are, mark you
forever....&quot;

The man&#39;s face paled, meeting Jess&#39; eyes and seeing
that she was entirely serious about what she was
saying. &quot;I came here on my own,&quot; he rushed to say
fearfully, &quot;I thought that the bounty on the do-gooder
on on the other side of town was for you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Lady Diana&#39;s territory,&quot; Jess hissed, eyes
flashing dangerously. She took a breath, &quot;If you knew
a damn thing you&#39;d realize that she and I avoid each
other like the plague.&quot;

&quot;I had also heard,&quot; he gulped nervously before saying,
&quot;that you two hated each other. I just thought that,
well....&quot;

Jess growled deep in the back of her throat and he
shut up promptly. &quot;All right,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;you
are going to go to the police and tell them you did
this, as well as about any other crime you may have
committed.&quot;

&quot;Are you nuts...?&quot; he blurted.

&quot;It&#39;s your choice,&quot; Jess said, her voice coming out in
a deadly purr, &quot;go talk to the police... or stay and
deal with me.&quot;

The man looked at her, a professional hitman meeting
the eyes of a supposed tattoo artist and he felt his
heart chill with fear. &quot;All right,&quot; he suddenly seemed
smaller, all the fight gone out of him as he sighed,
&quot;I&#39;ll go confess to the police.&quot;

Jess watched him go, kicking the rocket launcher aside
with a scowl as she muttered under her breath, &quot;What
the hell is going on with Lady Diana?!&quot;

The tattoo parlor was dark as the fierce looking Jess
went back inside, moving through the front without
looking at the posters decorated with fantasy figures
and dangerous women into the back, her private work
area. A lean but shapely blonde was sitting there
waiting on the edge of the table, her face lighting up
in a smile as Jess entered.

&quot;It took you long enough, lover,&quot; Elizabeth purred.

&quot;We&#39;re not lovers,&quot; Jess reminded her, reaching out to
touch the girl&#39;s arm where the first few cuts
shimmered slightly, red blood smearing pale skin.

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Elizabeth laughed, then shuddered genty
under Jess&#39; touch. &quot;So what made the shop shake?&quot; she
asked as the taller woman delicately blotted up the
remaining blood, leaving a delicate tracing of a fiery
bird behind.

&quot;Stupidity,&quot; Jess answered her, trying not to smile as
a certain scent of arousal reached her nose. &#39;She&#39;s
such a masochist,&#39; she mused as Jess delicately
stroked the wounds clean with sterile cotton, &quot;even
this little pain feels like pleasure to her.&#39;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Elizabeth looked up, slowly moistening her red
lips with the pink tip of her tongue. With a sudden
move she pressed her body up agrainst Jess&#39;, her lips
brushing against hers.

Jess put her hands on Elizabeth&#39;s shoulders, feeling a
sudden flash of hunger as the smaller woman&#39;s tongue
slipped between her lips. They kissed deeply, Jess&#39;
hands moving reflexedly to pull the very willing young
woman up against her.

&quot;Please don&#39;t say no,&quot; Elizabeth moaned as Jess pulled
back a moment to look into the girl&#39;s feverishly
hungry eyes.

&#39;I want this,&#39; Jess realized breathlessly, &#39;almost as
much as she seems to. It&#39;s been too damn long since
I&#39;ve had....&#39;

Elizabeth kissed her once again, letting her mouth
gently trace across Jess&#39; jaw before eventually
flicking across her ear. &quot;The last time you took care
of me,&quot; the smaller girl gently pressed Jess
backwards, tugging impatiently at her shirt, &quot;this
time, let me.&quot;

Jess gasped as the girl got her shirt up, lapping like
some overgrown kitten at her breasts. &#39;Way too damn
long,&#39; Jess thought, tangling her fingers in the other
girl&#39;s hair and firmly pressing Elizabeth&#39;s mouth to
her breasts.

&quot;I&#39;m going to enjoy this,&quot; Elizabeth purred, sliding
down the lanky woman&#39;s body, kissing her belly button
before unclipping her jeans. With a single smooth
motion she yanked both pants and underwear down,
leaning forward to press her lips to wet flesh.


&quot;This can&#39;t happen again,&quot; Jess quietly said as she
saw Elizabeth off, both of them standing out there in
the chill morning air.

&quot;That&#39;s what you said the last time,&quot; Elizabeth
answered, reaching up to gently stroke the latest
tattoo she had done. She smiled slightly as she said,
&quot;Maybe you should just let yourself have what you
really want.&quot;

Jess raised an single eyebrow as she asked her, &quot;And
that would be you?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Elizabeth firmly shook her head, &quot;you&#39;re
longing for something, Jess, someone that you don&#39;t
have just yet.&quot;

Jess shook her head slightly as she admitted with a
sigh, &quot;I&#39;m almost impressed that you can read me so
damn well.&quot;

Elizabeth smiled as she reached out to put her hand on
Jess&#39; cheek, &quot;Tell her how you feel, let her try to
fill your needs.&quot; A suddenly wicked smirk appeared as
she added, &quot;Or you could always just keep me on your
speed-dial.&quot;

Jess scowled, &quot;You never give up.&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; Elizabeth stole another kiss before
sauntering away, hips gently swaying.

&#39;She&#39;s too perceptive,&#39; Jess thought as she turned to
go back into the shop, &#39;but how do I tell someone like
Alice that I want us to move on to a more physical
relationship? She&#39;s nervous enough just being my
friend.&#39;

Calmly Jess cleaned up the back room, dropping the
bloody scalpel she had used into boiling water.
Insense candles were lit to cover up the scent of sex,
then she moved over to the surgeon&#39;s table that she
kept back there. The sheets were soaked with sexual
juices and a bit of blood, the scent heady in the room
as she bundled them up and replaced them with fresh,
clean sheets.

&quot;And then there&#39;s the situation with Diana,&quot; Jess
muttered once she was finished cleaning up. She walked
over and picked up her phone, dialing the number from
memory.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Grace answered, Diana&#39;s executive secretary
speaking with her normally smooth and refined
delivery. It was only when you got to know her that
you came to realize that she was as corrupt as her
mistress, in her own way.

&quot;This is Jess,&quot; she answered crisply, &quot;I want to speak
to the Lady,&quot;</pre>
