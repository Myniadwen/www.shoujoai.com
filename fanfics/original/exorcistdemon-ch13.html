<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>      When Seth had knocked on Krystal&#39;s door in the afternoon to return some of her 
exorcist gear she accidentally left in his car, he didn&#39;t expect the scantily clad Isaka to 
answer the door. He didn&#39;t realize that she moved so fast! Heck, he&#39;d just broken up with 
Krystal! &quot;Seth! I&#39;m actually glad to see you for once!&quot;

      His eye twitched at the insult/greeting, but he held up the bag containing Krystal&#39;s 
things. &quot;She, um, left this in my car.&quot; The demon took it and then gave him a big hug. 
&quot;Thank you so much for breaking up with Krystal!&quot;

      He ground his teeth and broke away from her. &quot;Yeah, yeah... no problem. I figured I 
didn&#39;t want to be a hindrance and stand in the way of you relationship.&quot; Isaka just blinked. 
&quot;Really? Well, because you broke up with her, I have Krystal all to myself!&quot;

      It hit him like a brick wall. &quot;W-wait... you mean I broke up with her so you could 
make a move?&quot; The demon just gave him a bright smile. &quot;Yep! Thanks! You know, Tycara is a 
nice girl,&quot; she said, about to close the door. &quot;Oh, and Krystal tastes even sweeter than I 
thought.&quot;

      With that, she slammed the door in the young man&#39;s face.

      Krystal peeked out from the kitchen and asked, &quot;Who was it?&quot; Isaka just held up the 
bag. &quot;Seth came to drop off your stuff.&quot; At that moment, both girls could have sworn they 
heard the young man shout and expletive at the top of his lungs. They chose to brush it off.

      &quot;What do you want for lunch, Isaka?&quot; The demon just came up behind her and wrapped her 
arms around her waist. &quot;Hmm... I&#39;d love to eat you...&quot;

      Krystal went bright red as the demon nuzzled lovingly into her neck. &quot;I-Isaka!&quot;

      &quot;I told you that you&#39;d never get rid of me...&quot; 

***** 

      Abby sighed as she sat in the living room. It had been around a year since Isaka had 
caused such a stir and now, they were having a reunion. Or something of the sort. Of course, 
Eveon and Mina were taking a suspiciously long time getting ready and coming downstairs. 
Both girls were 15 and now Abby actually HAD to worry about them... about them having... 
Well, at least neither of them could get pregnant.

      The door bell rang and she got up to answer it. It was merely Seth standing there 
bashfully with Tycara practically glued to him. It was then that Abby stared up at the 
ceiling and said, &quot;Thank you for granting us one hetero couple to balance us all!&quot;

      Tycara and Seth exchanged worried looks before entering and sitting down. It was then 
that Evelyn and Mina started coming down the stairs. Granted, their hair and clothes were 
quite haphazard and Abby gave them a knowing look.

      &quot;Mommy! Don&#39;t look at us like that! I promise, we&#39;re thinking of waiting until 16...&quot; 
Eveon&#39;s protest fell on deaf ears as the three people in the room just rolled their eyes. 
Mina giggled and whispered in to her ear, &quot;Do you remember the poker game? You just give me 
the word and I&#39;ll live up to it.&quot; Eveon&#39;s face went beet red.

      Luckily, she was saved from embarrassment when the doorbell rang again. All five of 
them knew it had to be Isaka and Krystal, but everyone except Seth and Tycara couldn&#39;t 
imagine them being a couple. Abby opened up the door to see Krystal childishly holding 
Isaka&#39;s hand. Abby had kind of expected to see them making out on the porch, but this was 
perfectly fine too.

      &quot;Hi, Abby!&quot; Krystal said happily as she was dragged inside by an overzealous Isaka. 
The demon gave Tycara a happy wave, which she returned, and a smug look to Seth who was 
still getting over the fact that he had handed his loving girlfriend over to a lesbian. He 
wasn&#39;t too happy about it... but Tycara just gave him a reassuring smile. If only he were a 
girl...

      &quot;So you guys are really... you know?&quot; Eveon asked, making strange hand gestures that 
made Mina slap at her hands.

      Isaka just lovingly embraced Krystal. &quot;Yes... yes we are.&quot; Krystal just hid her 
embarrassed face in the crook of Isaka&#39;s neck. &quot;Have you and Mina been well,&quot; asked the 
demon. Eveon just blushed and nodded, intertwining her hand with Mina&#39;s. &quot;Yeah, we&#39;ve been 
fine.&quot;

      Eveon had become the slightly taller than the two by an inch or so, and was starting 
to complain about being submissive to Mina. Of course, she soon found out that if she gave 
it a little bit of effort, she could make Mina melt in her arms.

      Abby let out a sigh and wandered into the kitchen. &quot;Enjoy your reunion; I&#39;m going to 
go drink something to dull the fact that my lesbian daughter gets a lot more action than 
me.&quot; There was an awkward silence as the three couple watched Abby leave and soon heard the 
sound of a cork popping.

      A party of sorts ensued, with food, drinks and tipsy Abby making lewd jokes about her 
daughter. Krystal luckily saved Eveon&#39;s virgin ears when Abby tried to give her tips on how 
to please a woman. Unfortunately, the blonde woman was unaware that Isaka was imparting the 
same advice to Mina.

      Finally, the party wound down, ending on a happy note. Tycara and Krystal helped Abby 
up to her room and Eveon and Mina had gone to sleep a little while ago. Granted, everyone 
had been listening to their room to make sure they weren&#39;t participating in &quot;adult 
activities&quot;, but the girls were quiet.

      Now, it was just Isaka and Seth sitting downstairs, waiting for their respective 
dates. &quot;So... you&#39;re dating Tycara?&quot; Seth just nodded and shifted on the couch. &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s 
a nice girl if a bit... hyper.&quot;

      They both laughed and she suddenly sent him a death glare. &quot;IF you EVER harm her in 
any way, I swear you will wake up one morning with an empty space between legs and two extra 
weights on your chest.&quot;

      Seth gulped. &quot;D-d-d-don&#39;t worry! We haven&#39;t even made out yet!&quot; He had been wishing he 
was a girl, but now... he wasn&#39;t quite too sure. &quot;Isaka! Our room is up here!&quot; The demon&#39;s 
expression suddenly changed into one of happiness as she trotted up to meet her love. When 
she was at the top of the stairs with Krystal, she held her around the waist and gave Seth a 
smug wave.

      She could be so mean... His thoughts of anger disappeared as Tycara came down and 
wrapped her arms around his neck. &quot;Are you tired? Abby only gave us one room, but I trust 
you, so...&quot; She just giggled and bit her lower lip. &quot;Yeah, don&#39;t worry. Isaka... um, has 
discouraged any of that kind of thinking.&quot; 

***** 

      Isaka sat on the edge of the bed, watching as Krystal came out of the bathroom. &quot;You 
always make me feel strange when you look at me like that...&quot; Isaka just laughed and started 
pulling her towards the bed. &quot;It&#39;s only because I love you.&quot;

      The demon watched in amusement as Krystal started suffering from tomato face syndrome. 
The buried themselves deeply in the covers and Isaka could feel Krystal&#39;s eager lips. What a 
surprise, Krystal usually didn&#39;t initiate... The demon didn&#39;t mind at all, parting her lips 
and tasting the sweet girl that belonged only to her. Her hands skated across her pajama top 
and slipped under to cup her-

      &quot;Not ready, Isaka,&quot; Krystal whispered sternly and Isaka regrettably withdrew her hands 
from under her shirt. &quot;Kry-stal,&quot; she drew out, &quot;...we&#39;ve been together for sooooo long...! 
Why can&#39;t I just... touch you? Your body is just crying out for it-&quot;

      The demon was effectively cut off when Krystal put a finger to her lips. &quot;Isaka, we&#39;ve 
been over this every night. Do you want me to turn you into a young child again?&quot; Krystal&#39;s 
stern mood was interrupted when the demon merely took her finger in her mouth and suckled it 
suggestively.

      When Isaka let go, she straddled Krystal&#39;s waist and gave her a knowing grin. &quot;How can 
you resist that?&quot; Krystal let out a sigh before reaching up and cupping Isaka&#39;s cheek. &quot;You 
know, it&#39;s a real turn off when you try to do that. I like it much, much better when you are 
sweet, not sultry.&quot;

      The demon pouted and got off of her waist, only to pull Krystal into her arms. &quot;You 
know I can be both...&quot; Krystal let out a long sigh of pleasure as Isaka assaulted her neck 
with long, languid open mouth kisses.

      &quot;Who would have thought...&quot; Krystal murmured out, making Isaka stop to look at her 
face. &quot;An exorcist and a demon being together.&quot; Isaka just grinned at her.

      &quot;Well, you can exorcise me any time.&quot;

      &quot;...Isaka... you never change...&quot;
