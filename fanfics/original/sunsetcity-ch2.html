~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Diamond Star, Brookwood District 

As soon as she left the Mao-Kung Dojo, Yun-Yun made sure to reach the 
Diamond Star as fast as possible. Jahn was a real bear when it came to 
lateness. But that really wasn&#39;t the issue. What bothered her was the 
prospect of another attack by the Zazubaza Gang. The over-zealousness of 
that group was beyond words. And Yun-Yun still didn&#39;t know who led the 
group. What she did know what that they were targeting bars and clubs 
all over the Brookwood District. Though gangland wars had been 
downplayed in the face of the regeneration of the city, battles tended 
to crop up every now and again. And one of the most powerful gangs in 
the city, Zazubaza, had a thing about marking off their &#39;territory&#39;. 
Brookwood fell into that category. Thus the Zazubaza made a habit of 
pestering and hassling anyone inside their scope of vision. It made 
working at the Diamond Star a teeny bit more dangerous than Yun-Yun 
would have liked. But it was better than not working at all. Besides 
which, Jahn was a friend. And though the English Boxer was a fair hand 
himself, he couldn&#39;t fend off the Zazubaza alone. 

Which was why Yun-Yun took a deep breath as she stepped in front of the 
doors to the Diamond Star. Part of her was expecting to see the place 
trashed and Jahn laying face down on the ground. But what she did see, 
was completely unexpected. The Chinese girl grabbed the handle of the 
door and yanked it open just to make sure that her fears were misplaced. 
They were. But there was still a surprise waiting for her.

&quot;Jahn, I came in early today, so-&quot;

Yun-Yun merely silenced herself as she looked over the space of the bar, 
past all the tables and stools and looked over at the bar side. Jahn was 
behind I as usual, wiping out a glass with a chequered rag. But there 
was someone else sitting on the opposite side of the bar. With a glass 
of Blue Moon and a confident smile. 

Yun-Yun was almost speechless. &quot;...R-Ryo? It can&#39;t be... Ryo?!&quot;

&quot;Hey, sweetness,&quot; Ryo offered with charm (or seemingly so), &quot;three years 
have been good to you too, huh? Little Yun-Yun&#39;s finally a woman.&quot;

Tears began appearing at the girl&#39;s face. She could hardly speak. But 
the second she got over her shock she rushed over to the outgoing 
Japanese youth. Ryo stood upright and groaned playfully as Yun-Yun threw 
herself into his arms, smiling and laughing and crying for all her 
worth. Jahn watched on as Ryo hugged her back. He could see the reaction 
that Yun-Yun would have to all this. She was the one who missed Ryo the 
most after he and his sister left three years ago. And to see how 
comfortable they are with each other now... you&#39;d have believed that 
they hadn&#39;t been separated for five minutes. When Yun-Yun finally pulled 
back and stared up into those cool eyes of Ryo Asagawa, Jahn took that 
as his sign to make himself busy. He had had his chance to catch up with 
Ryo and now it was Yun-Yun&#39;s turn. 

The English gentleman put down his glass, slung his rag over his 
shoulder and strode out from the bar into the back. Some beer barrels 
needed taking care of anyways. And this left the two teens alone to 
digest their current reunion. 

Ryo was the first to speak after that. &quot;I guess I was missed. Maybe a 
little more than I thought I would be.&quot;

&quot;Bastard,&quot; Yun-Yun spoke, smiling tearfully, &quot;Out of the three years 
you&#39;ve been gone you&#39;ve called me twice. And written to me three times. 
But you&#39;re still as cocky as ever when you finally come back, huh?&quot;

Ryo shrugged. &quot;Did you expect to find me any other way? Sorry, Babe. 
Guys like me, we just don&#39;t mature. I guess that&#39;s what makes us such 
fun.&quot;

&quot;And unreliable. But you&#39;re here now. And I swear you&#39;ll never hear it 
from me again, but I&#39;m so glad to see you, Ryo.&quot;

The Japanese boy nodded. &quot;Me too. But I can&#39;t imagine why you&#39;d wanna 
see me again. Catchin&#39; sight of  me would just remind you about the old 
days. And from the looks of Brookwood... I&#39;d have to say that those days 
are over.&quot;

Yun-Yun took that moment to nod and walk around behind the bar. She was 
sure that Jahn wouldn&#39;t mind her busting out one of the drinks in such 
an event. The Chinese woman reached under the bar and opened a 
mini-fridge for cool drinks. There was a particular alcoholic drink that 
she had her eye on. Yun-Yun pulled it out, slammed the mini-fridge shut 
and twisted open the bottle, gulping some of the drink down.

&quot;Don&#39;t be so sure,&quot; Yun-Yun finally answered, &quot;Three years is a long 
time to be gone. And this place is very different from then. All the 
graffiti, slums and waste is gone. Less unemployment, free health care, 
outside access. But that doesn&#39;t make the streets any safer than they 
were. Everything you see here is a veil. The same dirt and scum of three 
years ago are just hiding behind it. Only difference now is that the 
crime is less overt. And there are bigger players involved this time 
around.&quot;

&quot;Like who?&quot; 

Yun-Yun gulped down some more. &quot;Like the KAIGA Group.&quot;

&quot;The KAIGA Group?&quot; Ryo blinked, surprised, &quot;That multinational 
conglomerate? But what would those big wigs want with Sunset City? I 
mean this place was considered one of the most crime-ridden towns on 
Earth up until now.&quot;

The Chinese woman shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m just as clueless about it as you are. I 
suppose that the businessmen working for them can see some brilliant 
financial opportunities that we don&#39;t. But this is our hometown after 
all. Who better to understand it than us?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ryo guzzled down some more of the Blue Moon, &quot;But enough about 
that. What about you? What have you been up to for the past three 
years?&quot;

Yun-Yun smiled. &quot;Just this and that. My grandfather gave me open reins 
on the Mao-Kung Dojo last year. Ever since then he and I have been 
training lots of new students and its been making us a lot of money. 
More so than the old days.&quot;

&quot;...But you&#39;re working for Jahn.&quot;

&quot;I know that,&quot; She replied, &quot;But it&#39;s not about the money. It helps me 
relax when I work here. Aside from the interference of the Zazubaza 
Gang, who I&#39;m sure Jahn has told you about, things are calm here. It&#39;s 
better than instructing people all day.&quot;

Ryo pressed his face into his palm, lazily. &quot;Well I see that you&#39;ve been 
doing well for yourself, all things concerned.&quot;

&quot;And you?&quot; Yun-Yun questioned.

&quot;Me? There isn&#39;t much to say. When my Pops died, Yoko and I left and 
went straight over to Japan to live with our adoptive uncle, Nobuo. I 
trained there for a while but things got boring so I just gave my sister 
a farewell and left to see more of the world. Went to all kinds of 
places. London, Avignon, New York, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro. You get the 
picture.&quot;

Yun-Yun&#39;s eyebrow ticked. &quot;And that&#39;s not much?&quot; 

&quot;Didn&#39;t feel like it at the time,&quot; Ryo answered, &quot;But I guess none of 
those places felt like... home, to me. Eventually I just realized that 
I&#39;ll never be happy anywhere but here in Sunset City. So that&#39;s why I 
came back. I offered for Yoko to join me, but she&#39;s pretty much told me 
that she&#39;s sticking around in Tokyo with our Uncle. I&#39;d prefer to have 
her with me, but, she can&#39;t be forced into anything.&quot;

Yun-Yun drank some more. &quot;Well... she&#39;s not the little girl clinging to 
your coattails anymore, I&#39;ll bet. She&#39;s a young woman. The two of you 
have your own lives to lead even if you share the same second name.&quot;

Ryo just shrugged. &quot;I suppose so. But now for the big question. Where in 
the good name of hell is Kayde?&quot; 

&quot;Lewis Charlie Kayde,&quot; Yun-Yun mouthed, leaning backwards, &quot;That guy is 
just as distant and cold as before. Maybe even more so. But I always 
make sure to keep tabs on him. He sometimes comes by the Diamond Star 
for a drink, and we spar occasionally up in the Mao Kung Dojo, but I 
barely see him twice a week.&quot;

&quot;Is he still living in his old place?&quot;

The Chinese girl shook her head. &quot;Nope. He moved out of there like four 
months after you and Yoko left the city. But I know where he lives and 
where he works. There&#39;s a snazzy new nightclub open in the Nippon Town 
district. It&#39;s called Whiteout. He works as a bouncer there. The music 
is amazing and the crowd gets bigger every night. And don&#39;t tell Jahn I 
said this, but the drinks are a hell of a lot cheaper over there as 
well.&quot;

Ryo smiled. His friend and rival, the cold-blooded American youth, 
Kayde, was still around. It made him wonder if Kayde had made any 
improvements to his style. Back in the old days of Sunset City, the only 
people around who good give Ryo a half-decent fight were Kayde and 
Yun-Yun. Time had passed since then and the Asagawa-boy had grown a 
whole lot stronger. But what about the others? 

Maybe he&#39;d pay Kayde a visit at work and find out. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Whiteout Nightclub, Nippon Town District

&quot;Well, well, well! Isn&#39;t this a little slice of Sunset Heaven?&quot;

Night had hit the city. These were the times when the scum of the town 
crawled out of the woodworks to have a little party. But thing were, as 
stated, different from before. Even though the punks and vagrants came 
out at night, there were cops all over the streets on constant night 
patrol for rowdiness and louts.  And though her could tell that they 
were good at their jobs, he figured that most people were in now hurry 
to suffer the brutality of those police officers. But he wasn&#39;t about to 
spoil his night thinking about all that. He was going to enjoy himself. 
The Japanese youth had come to the so called Whiteout nightclub with 
Yun-Yun to check it all out. And it was just as good as Yun-Yun had made 
it out to be. The two youths stood in front of the large archway into 
the club, standing in an entry line of velvet carpeting. They were a 
good ten metres down the line from the entrance but even from their they 
could hear the banging street music playing into the background of the 
club. All the clattering of glasses and the banter and the laughter. It 
was everything you could expect from a club in Sunset City. That was the 
one thing the teens of this town knew about other than fighting. 
Partying. But from the looks of things, this club wasn&#39;t as rowdy as the 
ones that Ryo and his friends always snuck into in the old days. The 
security around here was tight. Bouncers dressed in fine black and white 
suits watched and stood over all those coming in. There were probably 
more inside. Obviously there to stop any fights that might spring up. 
That was another common thing to happen in Sunset City clubs back in the 
old days. But that kind of thing happened everywhere. 

As Ryo stood in line with Yun-Yun, waiting to get inside, he spoke. &quot;So 
Kayde actually works in a place like this? Who&#39;d have guessed it? Back 
then he didn&#39;t seem the type to be a bouncer.&quot;

&quot;He only does it for the money,&quot; Yun-Yun replied, &quot;He told me that 
before. Now that I think about it, it isn&#39;t really his style, is it?&quot;

Ryo smiled. &quot;Not by my memory. But I have been gone a while.&quot;

They continued to talk about the issue as the thin line continued to 
recede. Eventually they reached the front of the line. Lucky for Ryo, 
Yun-Yun had already paid for two to get into this place. She had 
intended on taking out some guy-friend she had, but Ryo was just too 
important. And this way they could see Kayde together. The Chinese girl 
brandished two slips in front of the bouncer who was checking people out 
before they entered the Whiteout. The other hulking bouncer manning the 
velvet rope allowed the two of them passage. Yun-Yun nodded in thanks 
and walked into the nightclub with Ryo on side. The two were bombarded 
with the banging music, alcohol-ridden young adults and humanity 
greatest achievement, slutty waitresses. Just as Ryo remembered Sunset 
City clubs to be like. The only difference was that this place was a 
whole lot cleaner. And probably a little safer. 

Ryo grinned at the sight. Though he had to yell loudly to be heard over 
all the music coming from the background speakers. &quot;Alright! Haven&#39;t 
been to a place like this in quite a while!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s great isn&#39;t it? Whiteout may have tight muscle but it still 
rocks!&quot; 

But before Ryo could actually enjoy any of this, he had to know if Kayde 
was around today. That was the main reason for coming to this particular 
nightclub after all. The Japanese boy cast his eyes around and searched 
through the crowds to the other side of this packed hall-like room. 
Behind the bar there was no sign of him. There was no sign of him on the 
upper banisters of the walls. Nor was he amongst the bouncers lined at 
the walls of the club. Where in blazes was he? Regardless, Yun-Yun 
grabbed Ryo by the arm and dragged him over to the bar to get something 
to drink. As they moved through the dense crowds though, they had no 
idea that they were being watched. On one of the tables to the far side 
of the room was a group of shady-looking teens. They eyeballed Ryo and 
Yun-Yun with familiarity, in particular Yun-Yun. If Ryo had noticed 
them, he would have seen that two of that group had been the ones he 
kicked out of the Diamond Star. 

They were the head cronies of the Zazubaza Gang.

But the ring leader was amongst them this time. And he was vastly 
different to the others. For starters, he was a full nine feet in 
height. A man-mountain, his chiselled Adonis-like muscles barely 
contained by his tight brown jacket and string shirt. An American 
national, this titan of testosterone dominated the Zazubaza Gang with a 
steel grip. 

&quot;That&#39;s the one, boss...&quot; Said one of the cronies, &quot;The one who forced 
us out of the Diamond Star. And the Chinese girl with him is that same 
chick who keeps defending the damn place.&quot; 

The giant ran a hand through his bangs of brown hair. &quot;What&#39;s his name?&quot;

&quot;Ryo Asagawa.&quot; One of the others answered. 

At that point, the leader of the Zazubaza Gang froze. The name rang in 
his ears as loudly as any bell. Asagawa. Memories of Tsukasa came to all 
those who were active in the fighting world of Sunset City. And now a 
boy of the same second name was getting involved in the business of his 
gang? The gigantic man stood upright, taking one last gulp of his beer 
whilst staring over at Ryo and Yun-Yun.  

He sneered. &quot;Whether he&#39;s connected to Tsukasa or not... I  can&#39;t have 
that little punk throwing his weight around in my territory. I say I 
give him a little taste of Zazubaza medicine...&quot;

Something that both Ryo and Yun-Yun were completely in the dark about. 
The two had picked up a drink each. They stood by the bar side and 
watched all the others dancing to the music and all those men who passed 
off hopefully chat-up lines to women in the hopes they could score. One 
thing with places like this was that you could always get a little show 
alongside the drinking. But Ryo didn&#39;t realize until the last minute 
that he was going to be the show of today&#39;s night out. He and Yun-Yun 
gabbed like usual until they both felt a massive shadow being cast over 
the two of them. 

Ryo looked up to see the leader of the Zazubaza standing above him. 
Despite the much bigger mass of muscle on this burly guy, Ryo didn&#39;t 
show a single shred of fear. &quot;Got a problem there, junior?&quot; 

The huge guy cracked his knuckles. &quot;Ryo Asagawa, right? The name&#39;s Cain. 
But most people in Sunset City call me Rockeye I&#39;ve heard quite a bit 
about you. Not many people outside of the gang scene wanna mess with the 
Zazubaza like you did.&quot;

Yun-Yun spoke soon after. &quot;You&#39;re with them, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;What was your first clue, sugar?&quot; Rockeye turned back to Ryo, &quot;And I 
respect all the confidence you&#39;re packing, kid. But you&#39;ve made a fool 
of two of my boys and we just can&#39;t have that now, can we?&quot;

Ryo smirked at him as he sipped on his bottle. &quot;I didn&#39;t have to work 
hard to make your posse look like morons. They&#39;ve got a knack for that 
all of their own.&quot;

Rockeye sniggered. &quot;Better watch that mouth of yours. I&#39;m the head of 
the Zazubaza Gang. We don&#39;t screw around no more. And I don&#39;t know what 
we were like in your day, but times have changed. Once I get revved 
up... you&#39;re as good as dead.&quot;

And to that, Ryo just shrugged. &quot;Could you repeat that? Sorry, I just 
couldn&#39;t hear what you said over all the bullshit.&quot; 

But saying that, Ryo had just pushed the last button. Rockeye released a 
powerful roar that was heard throughout all the music and noise in the 
background of the Whiteout. He grabbed Ryo straight by the collar of the 
neck. He turned in motion and dragged Ryo ahead of him and over the 
shoulder. Yun-Yun gasped as Rockeye tossed the not so light Ryo straight 
into the musky air overhanging the crowds of the club. Ryo glided across 
the club until he regained his senses. He tightened his body into 
himself and flipped forwards until he landed into a small dent in the 
crowds. Everybody around gasped at the speedy and timed landing, leaving 
Rockeye with a few questions on his mind. The groups of people hanging 
around all silenced themselves and stepped back. Opening up a large 
circle of room. They could tell from experience that this was a new 
challenge between two fighters. Ryo smiled at this sight. Just like the 
old days. 

Rockeye stood next to Yun-Yun, cracking his knuckles again. &quot;...Not bad. 
You&#39;re pretty agile if you can worm your way out of a throw like that. 
But make no mistake about it. You are gonna regret the day you met me!&quot;

Again, Ryo simply let such comments roll off his back. He pulled his 
trained fists up and spread apart his feet, shuffling into a fighting 
stance. &quot;Could you stop stroking your ego and just fight a little?&quot; 

It was obvious to anyone that Rockeye didn&#39;t have much of a taste for 
Ryo&#39;s smart mouth here. The titan of man-muscle bellowed another 
powerful roar and charged straight across the divide of space created 
for the two of them to fight. Ryo gave one quick look at Yun-Yun to make 
sure that she was okay and then turned to Rockeye. He came quickly, a 
far faster runner than someone of his size normally was, and attacked. 
One of those powerful, meaty arms was thrown into Ryo&#39;s direction in the 
form of a punch. The Asagawa-boy dodged away from it and sidestepped 
Rockeye&#39;s entire body. With a kind of speed that Rockeye could hardly 
keep up with. The giant man turned himself around and swung another 
punch in Ryo&#39;s direction. The youth ducked under the attack with a 
playful smile. Then a third one came. Ryo leaned his entire body 
backwards, as that meat hook  hand skimmed over his upper torso. 
Avoided. The people surrounding the whole thing looked on as Rockeye 
grew more and more frustrated with all of this. He couldn&#39;t lay a hand 
on this guy. And then some of the tall bouncers began to notice that 
thicker gathering of teens. Knowing full well that it meant trouble. 
Three of the well-dressed bouncers scrambled over to the cluster of 
clubbers to see what the commotion was about. But a forth bouncer, who 
happened to be watching the fight, stopped them from interfering in it. 
None of the three were particularly happy to let this kind of thing 
pass... but that blocking bouncer was not to be questioned. And he had 
particular interest in the outcome of this fight. 

Rockeye gave off another of those powerful cries of war and hurled 
himself at the poised and playful Ryo Asagawa. But he had been playing 
with his food for long enough. Time to fight back. The bull-charging 
Rockeye ran straight towards the boy. But he held his ground. Before 
Rockeye even pulled up his hand to attack Ryo, the younger man took 
action. With almost artistic speed he shifted to one side of the massive 
man&#39;s charge and crouched downwards. Ryo deftly extended his leg and 
Rockeye stumbled over it. His shock knocked him from his charging 
posture and he began the fall downwards. Ryo swiftly jumped upwards from 
that crouching kick and pulled up his leg along with him. He brought 
down the kick in a violent axe-like arc, smashing into the neck of the 
bigger man. Rockeye was fully grounded seconds later. And all his 
Zazubaza cronies expressed gasps of shock at the sight of their downed 
leader. Ryo landed swiftly and drew back his leg, still smiling. 

Yun-Yun on the other had, was shocked. &quot;Incredible! Ryo is not the same 
boy who left Sunset City three years ago. I never remembered him making 
those kind of seamless movements before. I was sure that he would have 
improved on his skills, but this...&quot;

&quot;Bastard...&quot; Rockeye seethed as he rose from the floor, &quot;...You&#39;re gonna 
regret this!&quot;

Ryo assembled another fighting stance. &quot;Hmm. Most people I know would be 
K.O grade after a hit like that. Oh well. We started the show so we 
might as well finish it with some flair. Or tenacity, in your case.&quot;

&quot;...Keep talking...&quot; With his head leaned down, Rockeye rose from his 
grounding. He tightened his fists together and growled under his titanic 
breath, poising himself for something. Ryo watched the veins on 
Rockeye&#39;s temple throb vividly. It seemed that he wasn&#39;t the type to 
like fighting those stronger than him. A sentiment that was quickly 
confirmed when Rockeye jerked his head right back up and bellowed out 
loudly, &quot;Iron Head!&quot;

The move was sudden. For more sudden than expected from such a bulky 
guy. But Rockeye yelled out his attack and rushed forwards and roared 
once more. He bashed his own head straight into that of Ryo&#39;s with such 
power that the boy was stunned senseless for a few seconds. Yun-Yun 
gasped and the bouncer in the crowds watched on. The Japanese lad 
stepped back from the man-mountain and scowled, holding a hand to his 
forehead. A trail of blood leaked downwards from the bangs of his hair. 
And Ryo couldn&#39;t help but notice how dazed he felt.

&quot;Damn...&quot; Expressed Ryo, &quot;T-That&#39;s one hell of a head butt!&quot;

The smile returned to Rockeye. &quot;Now do you see my power, boy?! Do you 
understand who you&#39;re screwing with?! The Zazubaza Gang rule this area. 
Anybody who gets in our way will answer to me and my iron fist!&quot;

Ryo pulled his hand away from his forehead, bleeding. &quot;.... And you call 
THAT power? Bashing that thick head around like a bulldozer?&quot;

Rockeye crossed his arms. &quot;It&#39;s enough to defeat you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so sure,&quot; Ryo said, his smile gleaming, &quot;I dunno what pansies 
have taken over gangland scene right now... but if they&#39;re ANYTHING like 
you, then this city is a hell of a lot safer than I would first 
guessed.&quot;

Rockeye&#39;s smile dropped. &quot;What the hell does that mean?&quot;

&quot;It means...&quot; There was a sudden burst of adrenalin in Ryo. The dark 
eyes of the youth gave off a tiny little glint of momentum. He drew back 
both hands and held them at his side, striding ahead. Mid-movement, Ryo 
pulled back his shoulder and thrust out his hand in a ruthlessly 
powerful punch. One where Ryo was actually trying to make an effort. The 
whole crowd gasped at the vicious sound of Ryo&#39;s fist striking the 
taller, muscular man dead in the stomach. Rockeye rocked forwards and 
groaned violently at the strength of the punch, his eyes widening. 
Before he even had the chance to adjust to the strike, Ryo thrust the 
other hand upward into his jaw as an uppercut. Rockeye&#39;s beefy head was 
thrown back from the neck with a sickening judder. A third blow then 
came. A kick. Ryo hopped off the ground and swung his leg around. His 
foot smacked the jaw and cheek of the older man. Drawing forth both 
blood and a purple bruise all in one instance. The massive, enormous 
torso of Rockeye was thrown backwards into the crowds surrounding the 
fight. They all gasped and strained as the added weight of the gang 
leader was hurled into him. And one of those people waved a hand over 
his face. The dude was knocked out. In only three strikes. &quot;....You&#39;re 
fucked.&quot; 

Now Yun-Yun was really shocked at it. &quot;...Is... that Ryo&#39;s true 
power...?&quot;

Even now, anyone with an affinity for Chi could see it glowing off the 
boy. Yun-Yun in particular. A beautiful but violent blue aura was 
surrounding him. It was both thick and willowy at the same time. A 
feeling that indicated that most of Ryo&#39;s power was lying untapped. But 
even so... Ryo Asagawa had grown stronger than ever. Far stronger than 
Yun-Yun herself. Was it all a result of his training in Japan with his 
sister and uncle? Or was there more to it than that? Before Yun-Yun 
could answer her own questions on the topic, new members of the Zazubaza 
Gang began to crawl out from the woodwork. They surrounded Ryo and cast 
him devious and angry looks. He had just humiliated and beaten the crap 
out of their leader after all. But if they were going to gang up on him 
then Yun-Yun wouldn&#39;t sit back on the sidelines and watch. She was just 
about to go out there and help, until a new figure made an appearance. 

A strong and familiar (to Ryo and Yun-Yun) battle cry was heard. One of 
the bouncers dashed through the crowds and leapt into the air. He 
extended his leg and kicked effortlessly, ploughing into one of the 
Zazubaza members. The thug was thumped across the face by the skilful 
flying kick, knocking him out instantly. The blonde bouncer then landed 
to the floor and stared off against the remaining five. 

&quot;You&#39;ve had your fun,&quot; He said icily, &quot;Now get the hell out of here 
before you make even bigger fools out of yourselves. Unless you feel 
like taking on the pair of us?&quot;

Well, that appeared to be enough for the day.  The lingering Zazubaza 
Gang members scrambled for the exit. One or two of them stopped to drag 
off their sleeping, lumbering leader, clearing the dance floor of all 
the commotion. The blonde bouncer then ran a hand through his long bangs 
of hair and said,

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned. It seems as if you quadrupled your strength since the 
last time we met. Three years has been a very productive stretch of time 
for you, Ryo.&quot;

The boy in question smiled at the bouncer. &quot;...Kayde.&quot;
