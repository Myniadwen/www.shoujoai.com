<p>“The Miraculous Meetings:  the crew of the Dauntless is complete?”</p>
<p>             “You know dear, I don’t think we should have stopped for that  hitchhiker, it was quite a bad idea, we’re going to be very late now,  and you know what my people say about that, yes, and I do admit that my  people are known for their charity every once in awhile, yes, but this  delay has caused us a great deal of time, hmm, don’t you see, because  it has made us late, and we are already running far behind schedule,  and any further, I’m afraid, will result in a sharp decline of profits,  don’t you understand, can’t you make this thing go any faster, hmm?”</p>
<p>            “No.  I am sorry.”</p>
<p>             “That’s very disappointing, yes, because even if you are trying your  best, and I know you are my dear, then that must mean this is all my  beautiful vessel can give us, yes, because this is probably its top  speed, and if you can’t exceed its top speed, as you’re no doubt trying  very hard to do, hmm, then that means we’ll be late, and I’ll have lost  a considerable profit, you know, because we’ll have missed the deadline  in the advertisement, aren’t you worried?”</p>
<p>            “No.  We’ll make it.”</p>
<p>             “My dear, I admire your fortitude, and that is precisely why I have  kept you on for so long, you see, because you’re a blessing, and no  member of my race could possibly hope to find any better servant, yes,  I really lucked out with you, didn’t I, but how can you be so sure that  we’ll make it, especially since picking up that passenger delayed us,  and we’re already running so very, very, VERY late, and I’m afraid that  our top speed simply won’t suffice to meet the deadline, so do you have  a secret, my dear?”</p>
<p>            “Yes.  A path through the heavens  that will take us there and will return one day and nineteen hours to  our schedule.”</p>
<p>            “Oh, that’s wonderful, however did you  find such a path, but wait, you had better not tell me, because more  than likely a member of my race has already bought and paid for it, and  if we use it and get caught, we can feign ignorance, yes, and say we  came here by accident, and were lost, and were unaware of the copyright  infringements, and I say, my dear, that if someone has not yet bought  this route, I would like to place my gold atop it, and charge the  tiniest profits, so be a dear and check to see if this path is owned,  but don’t tell me, all right?”</p>
<p>            “I have already filtered the route through all known Norgrin venues.  It has not been bought.”</p>
<p>             “Oh thank heavens, well, then that means I’ll take it, so would you  please record that in the archives, and remove the necessary funds from  my account, because I’d like to own a shortcut like this if it’ll save  us some time, but I say, my dear, kindly refrain from using our  species’ name, because as you know, it has already been copyrighted,  and I don’t want to have a lawsuit because my innocent servant was  ignorant of our statutes, and you WILL be more careful in the future,  won’t you?”</p>
<p>            “Yes.  I will try, Master.”</p>
<p>             “Good, that’s good, you’re quite a dear, now please keep course and  tell me when I have ownership of this pass, and do you think I’ll  already have a revenue when we arrive at Strategos, and how rich is  this Dr. Miracle, I wonder, if he or she can offer 300G to practically  anyone in our humble galaxy, or for that matter, a greater sum once the  job is complete?”</p>
<p>            “I’m not sure.  I have not been able to discover any records concerning Dr. Miracle’s status or identity.”</p>
<p>             “I assumed as much, and an ‘A’ for effort, I suppose, and more than  likely, he or she is a fan of anonymity, and they must be, if they are  this wealthy, and take treasure-hunting as a hobby, because they’re  most definitely a person after my own heart, and a fine ally if any of  the rumors prove to be true, but my dear, aren’t you supposed to update  me about the status of this path?”</p>
<p>            “It’s already  yours, Master.  Everything you have requested has been completed.  You  have not made any profit from the passage yet.”</p>
<p>            “I  didn’t expect to, my friend, since we ourselves have just arrived, and  if nobody else knows about this, as you claim, then how in the world  could I make any profit yet, when we are not yet out of the pass  ourselves, but oh well, it’s still very fresh, and if I make some  advertisements, I’ll have all my investments back in spades, so make  that a top priority, and by the way, how much closer is Strategos now,  and will we make our deadline?”</p>
<p>            “Strategos is  approximately 347 light-years away, and at the rate we are going, we  will make it with about ten hours to spare.”</p>
<p>            “Ten  hours, did you say, because when you think about it, that’s hardly any  time, I mean we don’t even know where Dr. Miracle might have docked, or  what the <em>Dauntless</em> looks like, and perhaps joining him or her  is a bad idea since it seems our host does not even have the prudence  to list these basic instructions, why, we could be searching the planet  for <em>days</em>, and we’d be no closer to finding our goal, and all  this trouble I went through will have been for nothing, and now I’m  depressed.”</p>
<p>            “We’ll find Dr. Miracle, Master.  We found the shortcut, didn’t we?”</p>
<p>             “Ah, yes, we did, and what a fool I am for thinking so negatively, yes,  we must all be positive, because if we surrender now, we’ll have  already lost, so we have ten glorious hours to spare, and with our  combined skills, we won’t even need one of them when we arrive, don’t  you think?”</p>
<p>            “Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Vimmy Fonester</strong></p>

<p><strong>Favorite pastime:  Observing the world</strong></p>
<p>             “How can that maiden endure such a rancorous master?” mused the  hitchhiker, shaking her head as she washed the dishes.  The swordswoman  was going to Strategos as well, to sign up as a warrior for Miracle’s  crew, but she didn’t even have enough money to buy a ticket for the  transport services:  knights of New Avalon led fairly monistic lives  and survived on the donations of others.  Vimmy and her servant Mink  had stopped by New Avalon only to refuel and trade (there was no way  the diminutive entrepreneur could resist), and while they were there,  they ran into a swordswoman who begged and pleaded for their  hospitality.</p>
<p>            “Art thou truly destined for Strategos?”  she had said.  Vimmy’s answer consisted of a long-winded speech  detailing the journey they had went through and the trials yet to come,  but in the end, she replied that she <em>was</em> headed there (“thank you for asking”), and wondered what business the knight had there.</p>
<p>“O  eloquent noblewoman, whose worth is surely beyond measure, I am but a  humble knight seeking a way to prove myself amongst my ranks, so that I  may achieve honor and title befitting the great, whereby I would be  given—“</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I’m sure it’s a lot, but you see my friend,  you’re wasting up a lot of our time, we really came here for supplies,  and I must thank your people for doing their part to boost my economy  and their own, but we must be off and I’m afraid taking you would  simply be out of the question, now if there won’t be any further  delays, we’ll be off.”</p>
<p>“You can join us,” said the chatty woman’s  servant.  The knight gazed up and beamed for joy; she clasped two  dark-gray hands just as the master gawked.</p>
<p>“I thank you, most worthy visitor!  I know not even thy names, yet I am indebted to thee beyond all capacity for words!”</p>
<p>“MINK,  you know full well that I don’t run a charity here and since this woman  has no money, as heartless as it may sound, we’ll have to leave her and  be on our way, so kindly—WHAT DID YOU SAY, YOUNG LADY?!”</p>
<p>“Um…I-I  s-said that I owe thee a debt, gracious one.”  Gears were already  beginning to turn in Vimmy’s head—she jerked it back and forth, humming  and smiling to herself—and finally seemed to come to a decision.</p>
<p>“You  say you owe us a debt, well, I’ll see you pay that, my friend, but  you’ll have to work very hard because Mink is my servant and she works  VERY hard, but you’re a strong woman and you seem capable, though I  doubt you’re Mink’s equal, but nobody is in this galaxy, so I kindly  welcome you aboard, but you must remember to keep everything nice and  tidy, and assume all responsibility for everything you do, and once  we’re on Strategos, we must part ways and I hope, I pray my friend,  that your debt is repaid, because what a tragedy it would be for you to  keep it while we’re guests aboard Dr. Miracle’s vessel, don’t you see?”</p>
<p>“I  understand.”  It was difficult following Vimmy, since she spoke at an  incredible speed, and always seemed excited even when talking about the  most mundane topics, but the lady-warrior got the gist of it, and knelt  before them both.  “I am at your service.  Prithee, introduce  yourselves, O great benefactors, and I shall give you my name as first  sign of good faith.”  Vimmy took at least a minute to introduce  herself; Mink just pointed to herself and announced her name.  If she  didn’t move, one would think this woman was a statue.  Her face  betrayed no emotion whatsoever, and she was so rigid and unflinching  that one felt she should be on a pedestal (the dark gray skin made it  even more believable).  Vimmy swore that Mink was the best and staked  no less than two-thirds of her entire fortune on the woman’s  reliability, for which the knight was deeply impressed.</p>
<p>“And how  about you?” Vimmy concluded eagerly.  She had very little interest in  the knight—it was merely the prospect of a debt that thrilled her.</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Sharyn</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species:  Human (<em>Homo sapien</em>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  New Avalon colony (orbiting Uther 10)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Skin color:  Green</strong></p>
<p>             And now Sharyn of New Avalon had to work her fingers to the bone in  order to pay off her debt.  Vimmy explained to her that the jobs she  was tasked to were normally reserved for Mink, but since she had so  graciously volunteered to take over, the gray-skinned servant could be  put to better use.  The experience was tremendously humbling for  Sharyn, who had been a proud warrior in her homeworld, but at least she  had a way to get to Strategos.  Sometimes she would see Mink wandering  around, attending to “better uses”, but there was not the slightest  hint of friendliness or even contentment on her face—nor was there  malice or grief.  That face was as clean and pure and dull as a smooth  slab, her eyes expressionless, her mouth flat, her voice deliberate and  slightly husky.  Sharyn couldn’t tell what Mink was thinking, and  although all she had to do was ask, she didn’t believe this would work.</p>
<p>             “Pardon me, benevolent Mink,” she called.  Mink paused to examine  Sharyn, silently wondering why she had been interrupted.  “Prithee, be  frank.  Have I caused thee offense, my friend?  For if thou art  agitated in any way…”</p>
<p>            “Why would I be angry?” Mink wondered.</p>
<p>            “Erm…then is something the matter?  Would you rather I not be here?”</p>
<p>            “No, it’s fine.  You wanted to come along and we have more than enough room.”</p>
<p>            “You are certain that all is well?”</p>
<p>            “Yes, if not better.”</p>
<p>            “Then I am a welcomed guest here?”</p>
<p>             “Of course.  But be mindful of Vimmy.  She is a good master, but very  greedy.  At least you were clever enough to take advantage of this.   Please excuse me.”  The words and expressions were mechanical, but  Sharyn could sense that Mink meant no harm, and was probably quite good  at heart, just not accustomed to strangers.  Not everyone could be as  bold, outspoken, or confident as Sharyn of New Avalon—and no doubt the  galaxy had billions of people very unlike her.  The mere thought  humbled her until she finally bent down and resumed scrubbing the  floors.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Strategos was used to receiving  millions of visitors every day, so being infiltrated by several dozen  adventurers did not affect it at all. As Chandra and Herut were landing  in their stolen vehicle (arguing about how they should dispose of such  a hot item, since they would no longer need it), Vimmy and Mink were  making a landing as well, their lone passenger weary but relieved.  Sharyn had proven herself a worthy servant during the long voyage over  and successfully cleaned the entire ship. Even though Mink’s  expressions did not change, she reported that she was glad to have the  assistance, and she hoped that she and Sharyn would continue being  friends as they worked for Dr. Miracle. As they left Vimmy’s ship, the  chatty businesswoman asked Mink and Sharyn to go search for the <em>Dauntless</em> while she sold her vessel.</p>
<p>“But  keep this in mind, my newly-freed servant,” she murmured in the  knight’s ear: “As worthy an aide as my dear Mink is, she’s developed a  habit of staring out into the open whenever she’s in a new place, and  I’ve noticed she has a particular fondness for aesthetic scenery, you  know what I mean, don’t you, so keep an eye out for her and make sure  she doesn’t slack, she’ll stare for hours if you don’t remind her how  important this is, and I say, be sure you ask around, because someone  in this port city is bound to know where our destination is, do you  remember its name, it’s called the <em>Dauntless</em>.”</p>
<p>“I shall  keep all this in mind,” Sharyn answered. She took Mink’s wrist and led  her through the city, and sure enough, the gray-skinned woman quickly  lagged behind as she gazed with hidden joy at the infinite sky  surrounding the flying continent. Sharyn couldn’t help but share her  enthusiasm, and slowed her gait so they could absorb the majestic  spectacle. Galactic records generally agree that Strategos once had  much more surface area, and was like any other terrestrial planet out  there. Three theories existed that suggested how it had arrived at its  current status, though members from each camp quickly dismiss the ideas  from their rivals.</p>
<p>Some people accepted the idea that a very  advanced alien species was responsible. They utilized a technology that  people were just beginning to grasp, and—in the face of a possible  apocalyptic scenario—raised several continents high into the sky in  order to preserve most of their world. Several crafts had already  explored the majority of Strategos’s atmosphere and could not support  this theory, since they pointed out that there would still be some  debris left around the core (citing that the law of gravity would keep  said remains suspended in the “middle” for as long as the planet  revolved). Others claimed that a massive meteor had struck the very  tiny planet, which had boasted an enormous atmosphere to begin with,  and scattered the pieces of the world into the air, where they were  supported by massive “balloons” of lighter-than-air gas. A final theory  claimed that Strategos had always been a gas planet, and the continents  were the remains of “living vessels” that could support and ferry life.  Whatever the reason, it was now used as a spaceport, and Sharyn and  Mink drank it in before resuming their task.</p>
<p>Normally, the wind  and moisture of the outside world is filtered in through small slots,  since to leave the continents exposed to the vast atmosphere would be  catastrophic. Cloud-farmers bring moisture and various gases in to  supply the world with basic materials, but sometimes a bit of steam  will slip in harmlessly. Sharyn observed several ghostly strands  dancing in the air and watched them in wonder, making sure to move a  little in order to avoid total distraction. The wisps gradually began  to take shape, though, and as she stared, now totally motionless, they  took the image of men, armed with various weapons.</p>
<p>“What devilry  is this!” she exclaimed, drawing her sword. Sharyn immediately sliced  through three of them—they were quite easy to destroy with her  skills—but more came to replace them, until there were fifteen of the  fog-men there.</p>
<p>“What business do you have with us?” Mink asked  flatly. One of the fog-men rushed her, but was eliminated as she swept  her arm right through his head. Five ganged up on Sharyn—she cut four  of them down, but was hurt by the fifth. She stumbled back in surprise,  her arm throbbing from the damage, her breath wary. These misty  entities were not difficult foes, but their numbers made them dangerous.</p>
<p>“I  shall not be beaten by the likes of thee!” she swore, impaling three in  one lunge. Mink “killed” two more—but how could anyone possibly kill  anything made out of smoke? More and more of them streamed in, even as  they fell by massive numbers. Destroying them was a cinch; surviving  would be nearly impossible. As Sharyn forced her way through their  ranks, covered with sweat and drops of her own blood, she noticed there  were even more of them around—scores and scores, but they were  attacking other people.</p>
<p>“We’re not the only ones afflicted by  this obstacle!” she said to Mink, who merely nodded in response.  “Somehow, we must escape and assist those people. Faugh—if only I had a  diversion!” She cleared a path for herself, but came to a screeching  halt just two meters shy of a precipice. Naturally there was a wall  erected to keep people from falling off, but it was so clear and  polished that it looked almost invisible. Sharyn was now cornered, and  even with the impassive Mink at her side, things didn’t look good for  her. She clutched her sword and held it before her, ready to die  fighting if necessary.</p>
<p>A gust of wind must’ve kicked up, because  she saw a large number of the assassins flying into the air, fading  away and drifting off. This was no breeze, though, but a helping hand  come to strike from behind. Bolstered by the kindness and bravery of  this stranger, Sharyn and Mink pressed on until the last of the fog-men  were eliminated. They were then able to behold their savior, who was a  fellow swordswoman, although one descended from the rabbit-folk, since  she had their long ears, their curious faces, and their puffy tails.  She had mesmerizing crimson hair and stood quite tall, but like most of  her kin, she did not look nearly as powerful as she was.</p>
<p>“We  thank you, kind lady,” Sharyn saluted. She reached out her hand, but  the other woman just grunted and sulked away. A second girl came  running by, slowly and wearily, dressed as a doctor but so frail, it  was a miracle she could go that fast. She reached the rabbit-warrior  and hugged her fiercely, declaring something Sharyn and Mink could not  hear. The doctor turned to look at her audience, blushed prettily, and  approached them, her gait very calm and sincere (if one can call a walk <em>sincere</em>).</p>
<p>“Are either of you wounded? Oh, look at that!”  Without waiting for an answer, she tended to their injuries—but how  quickly and efficiently she worked! It was common to see physicians  wandering around Strategos, but none of them had this woman’s skill.  Five seconds after she finished dressing their wounds, Sharyn and Mink  felt better than before.</p>
<p>“We are in your debt yet again,” said the knight, bowing deeply. “If there is anything we may do to show our thanks…”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not necessary,” answered the doctor brightly. “I’m just doing my duty.”</p>
<p>“Take us to the <em>Dauntless</em> if you know where to find it,” spoke the warrior. Sharyn and Mink gazed  at her as they realized they were all headed in the same direction.</p>
<p>“Would that we could, friends.”</p>
<p>“We’re  searching for it now,” Mink replied. “It seems we’ve been led to find  each other.” The quiet warrior nodded curtly; her companion clapped her  hands cheerfully.</p>
<p>“Wonderful! We can go look for it together! Oh,  by the way, this is—“ The doctor was suddenly cut off as a petite,  purple-skinned, fashion-conscience creature scurried past them,  berating her companions in a shrill, incessant voice.</p>
<p>“Mink, Woman, why haven’t you found the <em>Dauntless</em> yet, I’ve already sold the ship and made a tiny profit, and I even had  time for lunch, which I hope you two have had because I’m not paying  for your meals, especially not now since you haven’t found the <em>Dauntless</em>,  and from the looks of things, you’ve been fighting as well, and who are  these two people, I have no doubt you’ve been up to no good, I expected  this behavior from you, Mink my sweet, but I thought this lady was a  little more responsible, well, I am disappointed, so answer me!”</p>
<p>“Who…” whispered the doctor.</p>
<p>“Annoying,” concluded the warrior. Mink sighed: it would be up to her to iron out the details.</p>
<p><strong>Name: Athena Sifr</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species: Usagin (<em>Primus lepus</em>) (commonly called “rabbit-people”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin: Olympia Prime (Olympus 1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Weapon’s name: Murisato</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name: Fuuka Fujiwara</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species: Kitsune (<em>Kitsunae</em><em> vulpus</em>) (commonly called “fox-people”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin: Onogoro (Shimada 4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hates: Snakes</strong></p>
<p>“Fog-Ninjas?!”  Vimmy blurted as explanations were made. It was by far the briefest  sentence she had made yet. After rambling for at least a good two  minutes longer, it was decided that the small group should help those  in need—and thus, little by little, the pilgrims became acquainted with  their fellow coworkers: Shana, Valti, Kate, Kyrie, Yenae, Eve, Allegra,  the Acheron sisters, Rebecca, Lil, Aseria, Chandra, Herut, Riene,  Athena, Sharyn, Fuuka, Vimmy, and Mink.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t surprise  me,” said a weary Yenae, once the last Fog-Ninja was wiped out. “Dr.  Miracle sent that ad throughout the whole galaxy, or so I’ve heard.  This probably isn’t even a fraction of the applicants. Well, the more  the merrier, I guess they say.”</p>
<p>“I see the docks,” Kate  mentioned. She felt uncomfortable with so many people around, and  decided to busy herself checking out the surrounding area. Strategos  was a far cry from her homeworld of Utopia; she shivered for joy as she  anticipated what other worlds they were going to explore. Soon everyone  could see their destination, and flocked there as a single group.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Even  though the ports of Strategos are littered with ships of every size,  color, shape, and design conceivable, somehow, it was impossible to  mistake the <em>Dauntless</em> in that crowd. There is a certain vague  similarity that most ships have, if they are made in the same galaxy.  The number of intelligent species in the Milky Way is vast, and their  diverse creativity leads to any number of possible results (humans in  particular claim the coveted title of “best imagination”), but after a  certain point, there are definite parallels between the work of one  species and the work of another. Not so with the <em>Dauntless</em>, for  this was a vessel that seemed to originate beyond the borders of the  Milky Way, borne out of a creativity so distanced and alien that no  other living creature could have conceived it. Later on, the crew would  understand that the <em>Dauntless</em> had indeed originated from  another galaxy, though which one it was, and how it had arrived on  domestic shores, were questions for another day.</p>
<p>Because the  creativity of these alien designers was so unlike anything that had  been seen before, it was very difficult to describe the craft. It was  roughly the size of a cruiser, and was certainly capable of comfortably  housing the number of hopeful candidates, with room to spare for  various necessities and luxuries. There was a conveyor belt ramp that  led from the ground to the interior, resembling the hungry mouth of a  dragon; the ship itself was a contradiction of engineering. It seemed  bulbous and sleek, dull creamy-peach and brilliant silver,  outstandingly intimidating and comfortably familiar, powerful but with  the grace of a swan, fierce and unrelenting and capable of surviving  Hell itself, hence its name, but very peaceful too: like the mighty  whale that, at a distance, seems terrifying, but is actually quite  gentle, yet unmistakably majestic all the same. The simplest way to  describe it would be to say it was a vessel magnificent enough for an  Emperor but practical enough for the humblest monk.</p>
<p>Naturally,  there was already a line. Vimmy wanted to push her way through (being  rather short in stature only increased her desire for attention), but  there were women in the line even rougher and more self-centered than  she was, and of course Sharyn played the role of police officer by  keeping the peace.</p>
<p>“We arrived with plenty of time to spare, lady Fonester, just as lady Mink predicted. There is no further need for haste.”</p>
<p>“Yes,  but I’m a very important person, and this business deal will make or  break my career, so why are all these fools prohibiting me from  achieving supremacy, and why do they have to take so long, can’t they  hurry up, don’t they understand that time is money?”</p>
<p>“Have  patience, Master,” Mink said calmly. “Dr. Miracle will not turn us away  since we have made it this far. We can certainly wait a few more  minutes.”</p>
<p>“She’s right,” Sharyn said, throwing the taller woman a  smile. Mink merely declined her head, so Sharyn just assumed she was in  a good mood. There were at least fifty people in the line by Mink’s  count, five or six of them males who apparently could not read, or else  thought very highly of themselves. Nobody could see the very front of  the line, nor could they tell if Miracle was there in person or if a  representative was thinning out the herd. A few people were already  being dismissed, though, mostly misguided males. The handful of females  being cut from the list trudged despondently away, but it was clear  just by looking at them that they would be of little use on this  dangerous voyage.</p>
<p>Chandra had charmed her way near the head of  the line, but discovered it was impossible to proceed any further.  There were two women between her and the reception desk, and even  though she poured her feminine wiles all over them, they refused to  budge. Being a pleasure unit designed specifically to be seductive,  submissive, attentive, and devoted, she was unversed in the niceties of  polite society and so failed to understand why what she was doing was  both wrong and ineffective. Her predecessors were strong people not  easily susceptible to fickle charisma or frivolous sex, yet their  species were ironically renowned for their passions.</p>
<p>At the very  front of the line, speaking with the receptionist, was an Elshyrin (or  snake-woman), who were infamous for their cold and intimidating  personalities. This one in particular craved action and adventure, and  one got the impression she would rather be in the middle of a war than  following a team of roughneck treasure-hunters. She glowed quietly with  a dull copper light, her slick, sensual scales shining in the light.  Unlike the Lamias, who slither along the ground with a more reptilian  appendage, the Elshyrin stand upon two legs, and are more apt to dress  like a human—this woman seemed to prefer loose-flowing robes and  dresses. Her muscular arms were crossed and her sharp teeth were bared;  a forked tongue wiggled in the air at times, testing the new sensations  all around her.</p>
<p>“Are you the one that’s keeping track of all  this?” she snapped, kicking the table impatiently. The receptionist  held down papers and pencils so they wouldn’t fly off, and smiled  warmly at the Elshyrin.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am. I’m Dr. Miracle’s assistant. Might I have your name?”</p>
<p><strong>Name: Naja Elapidae</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species: Elshyrin (<em>Lamias erectus</em>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin: Jelrin (Prayxus 2)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greatest strength: Ambition</strong></p>
<p>“Ah  yes, I remember you made a reservation, and your people insisted that  my master take you with us. Welcome aboard, Miss Elapidae!”</p>
<p>“Don’t  get cozy!” Naja snapped, pushing the receptionist’s hand away. “I’m not  exactly pleased to be here. My people insisted? Ha! Those toothless  bastards sure can lie. They forced me here in order to humiliate me!! I  aspire to great heights, so don’t think I’m going to let you or your  fucking treasure hunt slow me down!!”</p>
<p>“I assure you, Miss  Elapidae, Dr. Miracle would never impede your ambitions. Even if you  are only staying with us for a short time, you are a welcome addition  to our team.”</p>
<p>“I dunno about <em>short</em>,” she grunted. “If it  came down to staying here or going home, I’d anchor myself down on your  ship. Just don’t disturb me for the rest of the day: I’m in a venomous  mood!” She opened her mouth to expose those legendary Elshyrin fangs,  which were already dripping with poison. The receptionist smiled warmly  and waved at her.</p>
<p>“All right, I’ll tell everyone else. Why hello  there!” she said to the next one in line, the girl preceding Chandra.  “Do you have an application filled out?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, right here!!” she  bellowed. She slammed the paper on the desk, upsetting the rest of the  paraphernalia. She looked willful and strong, and just a bit angry at  the world, but this only sharpened her adorable features. She was a  cat-girl through and through, from the tip of her fuzzy white tail to  the faint whiskers on her cheeks, all the way up to her pointy cat ears  and snobbish pink nose. It is universally believed that cat-folk (a  derogatory slang word for the Felinis people) are bubble-headed,  impulsive, moody, arrogant, lazy, and quick-tempered sex fiends, with  one particular race having a craving for their own gender. As the  receptionist read this furry girl’s résumé, however, she quickly  discovered that she was a deviant.</p>
<p><strong>Name: Alala</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species: Felinis (<em>Felis</em><em> sapiens</em>) (commonly known as “cat-folk”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin: Tigris (Leo 4)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Biology: Half-human, half-Felinis</strong></p>
<p>“Oh wow,” the secretary gasped. “You received valedictorian at Phobos <em>and</em> Ares Academies?! That’s incredible! It also says that you have several  years’ experience as a records keeper, and have practiced contortionism  for nearly half your life. That’s wonderful!”</p>
<p>“You’re damn right  it’s wonderful!” Alala shouted. “I’m gonna prove something to those  dogs who dared to laugh at me, and if they can’t respect my academic  prowess, then maybe getting rich and famous will show them! Whaddya  say, lady? Am I in or not?!”</p>
<p>“You’re definitely in,” chuckled the  receptionist. “Dr. Miracle will be delighted to have such an energetic  and intelligent lady onboard…and think of how useful it will be to have  an escape artist with us!”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah!” she roared, balling her  fists and unintentionally striking a very adorable pose. “This’ll show  them! You won’t regret this, lady, I promise! So where do I go now?!”</p>
<p>“Just head up the ramp to your right and make yourself at home. There are plenty of rooms, so find one that suits your tastes.”</p>
<p>“Great!”  she growled happily. “So when do we blast off, huh? When do we get to  find the treasures?!” The receptionist laughed beautifully; Alala was  bursting with zeal and spirit, which would certainly boost morale.</p>
<p>“All  your questions will be answered later. Will the next one in line please  step forward?” It was Chandra’s turn now, and she immediately went  right to work, fixing a seductive gaze on the unsuspecting secretary.  She was certainly not unattractive, although far from the beauty that  Chandra herself exuded. The woman actually looked fairly mousy and  petite: she had soft brunette hair wrapped in two pigtails, a face that  shined with love and patience, two small honest green eyes (hidden  behind oversized eyeglasses), and she dressed shoddily—apparently the  type of woman who didn’t care about fashion. Her vague, innocent  expression concealed a woman who was likely closer to thirty than  twenty, and a pair of crutches was leaning against her chair: her right  foot was swathed in bandages, and the woman winced whenever she put any  weight on it.</p>
<p>“Hello, beautiful one,” Chandra whispered huskily.  “I’m Chandra, the passionate one. If there is anything I may do for  you…truly, anything at all…you must not hesitate to ask.” She concluded  with a giggle and waited for the magic to take affect. The receptionist  didn’t even seem to notice the flirtation, and smiled politely.</p>
<p>“Actually,  you can fill out an application. I’m afraid that Dr. Miracle will not  accept you until you have completed one. It would be unfair for  everyone else.”</p>
<p>“But I’m already at the front of the line,”  Chandra moaned. Acting so defenseless was a surefire way to earn the  sympathy of anyone she desired—but once again, this meek woman was not  stirred.</p>
<p>“It only takes about half an hour to fill one out. You  may return it to me whenever you are finished. I assure you, the good  doctor will not depart until midnight tonight, so you have ample time.”  The receptionist laughed warmly, disarming Chandra and disabling her  powers. She was smart enough to realize there were some people she just  could not seduce, no matter how hard she tried, and unfortunately, she  had met her match in this unassuming assistant. With a sigh, she  accepted defeat, but scribbled as fast as she could, fearful that every  second counted.</p>
<p><em>To be concluded…</em></p>
<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Naja: WHAT!? That’s IT? This sucks! I came all the way out here and I barely get a few words out of my mouth!</p>
<p>Aseria: There’s nothing we can do: this seems to be a very lengthy opening chapter.</p>
<p>Naja:  Well, I just hope everything finally resolves itself next time! I’m  spending valuable time with these fifth-rate thieves! They had better  appreciate it.</p>
<p>Herut: We’ve been through a lot, but in the next  part, we finally get to see who makes the cut—and who is just cut! I  hope Chandra doesn’t finish in time, heheh.</p>
<p>Yenae: Ooh, scary girl! She’s a cutie, too! I wonder how ticklish <em>she</em> is!</p>
<p>Athena: Hmph.</p>
<p>Fuuka:  I think what my dear Athena meant to say is that you should all stay  tuned for the conclusion of the first chapter: “The Miraculous  Meetings: will we all make the grade?”</p>
<p>Athena: We’ll see.</p>
<p>Lil: Damn! If the first chapter is FOUR PARTS long, how will the rest of the story play out?</p>
