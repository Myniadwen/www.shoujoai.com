<pre>Recap of story &amp; characters

Story - In the Realm of Dreams, a human girl training as a Dream 
Guardian (Reika) has fallen in love with her dragon companion Trina. 
After Trina&#146;s rape the two confess their secret love and begin on a 
long road together towards an uncertain future. But they&#146;re not alone. 
With their friends Ami (human studying to be a Judgment), Kismet (elf 
girl studying the mystical art of SpellThrashing) &amp; Mi&#146;shari 
NamoCatCat (Guardian in training) they&#146;ll walk the road towards their 
future (while studying to make the grades and pass their exams to 
become the best they can be at Guardian Academy).

And now---

It&#146;s been two weeks since the day Trina &amp; Reika confessed their love.

Things changed for the both of them since then.

Trina moved out of the giant campus dorm for dragons and into her 
lover&#146;s room as a bondmate (which was allowed by campus rules between 
two students training to be a Guardian Duet (two Guardians working 
together)). They&#146;ve mostly kept &#147;room&#148;, and helped each other study to 
date, but slowly their feelings continue to grow and mature for each 
other.

On top of the hill where Trina first met Reika, the young human female 
lies on Trina&#146;s back (in her dragon form) as she watches the clouds 
lazily drift by. Beneath her, Trina lounges without a care, munching 
on a pink cotton candy bush she swiped from the nearby Choco Woods 
(where everything is edible).

&#147;I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll ever get tired of this.&#148;

&#147;Get tired soon.&#148; Trina remarks playfully, &#147;I want my turn lying on 
top of you soon.&#148;

&#147;Change first and we&#146;ll talk about it.&#148;

&#147;Looks like you two lovebirds are hitting it off just right.&#148; a voice 
calls out from behind. The two turn to look as Mi&#146;shari finishes 
climbing up the hill to meet them. &#147;Maybe you two would like to let us 
use your room this week for study buddies since we used my room last 
week.&#148;

&#147;I guess. That OK with you, Trina-chan?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s fine. I didn&#146;t like the smell of catnip in Mishy&#146;s room.&#148;

&#147;Mi&#146;shari, not &#147;Mishy&#148; and don&#146;t diss it until you tried it.&#148;

At that Trina makes a sick face, &#147;I&#146;m not a Neko.&#148;

&#147;Then stop complainin&#146;. The Choco Trees gave up some of their 
branches. Come on down, the others are already waiting there for us.&#148;

-----

Kismet chomps down on another chocolate branch, a dull &#145;pok&#146; sound 
emanating as she snaps abit of the branch off in her mouth and chews 
on it. &#147;Maybe you should have been Trina&#146;s human, Ami, you two seem to 
adore those cotton bushes to death.&#148;

&#147;We do not!&#148; she complains, grabbing another fluffy handful of the 
bush and shoving it into her mouth, chewing quickly in her annoyance. 
&#147;It just tastes good.&#148;

&#147;Uh-huh.&#148; (thinks for a second) &#147;Your friend Rena wrote yet?&#148;

&#147;No. She moved to Terra(*) a few weeks ago. Something about work but I 
haven&#146;t heard anything about any open assignments on Terra.&#148; (note - 
see end of chapter for notations during episode).

&#147;Figures.&#148; Kismet pouts, chewing on her branch as she does, &#147;She&#146;s 
probably getting into somebody else&#146;s business again as usual. I 
personally don&#146;t see how that friendship started anyway.&#148;

&#147;Rena &amp; I haven&#146;t gotten along very well since I met her back in our 
old home valley. Anyway, it&#146;s easier that way.&#148; (gives Kismet a 
serious look) &#147;She&#146;s one of the few who know the truth about us.&#148;

&#147;Well then keep her far far away from us as far as I&#145;m concerned.&#148; 
Kismet jokes.

As her hand reaches down for another branch, a new hand beats her to 
it. &#147;Hey!&#148;

&#147;Hay&#146;s for horsies.&#148; Reika remarks, sticking the chocolate branch into 
her mouth as she starts to nibble and bite at it. &#147;Your not trying to 
wipe out the forest are you?&#148;

&#147;It fell fair and square on the ground! I&#146;m not eating live branches!&#148;

&#147;Is that better?&#148; Ami asks from her side.

&#147;Of course it&#146;s better!&#148; (Kismet) &#147;Where have you been? The live 
branches has chocolate sap running through them, but the school 
forbids the eating of live trees.&#148;

&#147;Of course the school bans it! We&#146;d have tons of students eating down 
live trees and they&#146;d strip the entire Academy valley of choco-tress 
in no time flat!&#148; Reika shoots back, huffing her breath as she does. 
&#147;Save some branches for the others. We&#146;re not the only girls here with 
a chocolate fetish.&#148;

&#147;I like the cotton bushes.&#148; Trina remarks smugly, chomping into 
another bush as she watches the others eating, which draws a sneer 
from Kismet, &#147;You and Ami love those bushes to death!&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t seem to mind when I let you have---&#148; (before Ami can finish 
her sentence Kismet is on top of her in a second flat shutting her 
mouth) &#147;---mmmp.&#148;

&#147;Give it up, Kizzy.&#148; Reika remarks slyly, &#147;The entire West Wing of the 
campus knows you two are doing it so stop pretending your so innocent 
being roomies and all!&#148;

&#147;NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!!&#148; Kismet shoots back at Reika, &#147;I don&#146;t bitch 
about your off species girlfriend! At least mine is humanoid by birth 
and not by design!!&#148;

&#147;You got some nerve---&#148;

&#147;YOU TOO!!&#148;

Before the argument escalates, Ami quickly gets between them, &#147;There&#146;s 
a flyer up on the bulletin board about a festival today! Let&#146;s go!&#148;

&#147;Festival?&#148;

&#147;The Mallow Trees are in bloom over in the Trellian Valley, Rei-chan, 
they&#146;re having their seasonal festival celebrating the Mallow Trees 
and the Mallow Berry harvest.&#148;

&#147;I read that flyer! There&#146;s supposed to be tons of cakes, snacks, 
goodies and other treats with a highlight of the festival being the 
scape&#146;s largest Mallow Berry Pie! I have to see that!&#148;

&#147;Or eat that, right Mishy?&#148; Kismet chides, &#147;Oh, why not. Sounds like 
fun and I heard the Mallow Trees are very beautiful this time of 
year---&#148; (smiles at Ami) &#147;---makes for a comfortable place to have a 
romantic picnic for two---&#148;

&#147;Party before sex, girls. Let&#146;s ride. C&#146;mon, Trina-chan, let&#146;s go.&#148; as 
she speaks she slides up onto Trina&#146;s back, sighing as she gets a firm 
grip, &#147;Sigh--- I love that feeling--- right there---&#148;

&#147;Bet you wish it was another part of me &#147;right there&#148;---&#148; (smirks 
playfully)

&#147;You two think you can keep from jumping each other until AFTER we&#146;re 
there?&#148; Kismet scoffs as she pulls one of her Rubicon cards (each 
holding a spell beast or Darkling (nightmare) within it&#146;s clear 
crystal facades, which act as her &#145;minions&#146; in battle or in doing 
tasks (like providing transport to the festival). With a snap of her 
arm she lets a card fly downward into the ground, where it breaks 
apart and releases a gigantic winged cat-beast (the card reforming 
into it&#146;s form and returning to Kismet&#146;s hand). &#147;The catgirl want a 
ride with us? Pleenty of room.&#148;

&#147;Nah. I prefer tech in my deck of cards.&#148; (tosses down her own card 
which releases a mechanized one person jet-wing which she straps onto 
her back (wings unfurled). &#147;Anytime your ready.&#148;

With a slight nod Trina takes into the sky first, followed by the 
winged cat-beast, then Mi&#146;shari&#146;s jet-wing. As they rise into the air 
Kismet&#146;s arms circle about Ami and draws her close. They don&#146;t say a 
word, but their feelings are known to each other as they watch the 
landscape spiral around them as they take course towards the Trellian 
Valley.

Softly, Ami whispers as she leans into the warm hug. &#147;Goddess--- so 
beautiful---&#148;

&#147;It is, isn&#146;t it. I like this view of the world, from on high like 
this---&#148;

&#147;Being here I mean--- in your arms--- feeling your warmth, the beating 
of your heart as I lay my head against your chest--- it&#146;s beautiful.&#148;

Kismet smiles, growing a little teary eyed as she lets her macho 
attitude slip in Ami&#146;s presence. &#147;Ami-chan--- my precious girl--- it 
is beautiful-- holding you this close--- feeling your warmth so near 
to me--- goddess---&#148; (leans head down so she and Ami are cheek to 
cheek) &#147;---you&#146;re everything to me.&#148;

&#147;Meh&#146;ai---&#148; (Ami shudders, speaking Kismet&#146;s family name softly, the 
name she only shared with Ami to seal their loving bond) &#147;I love you, 
Meh&#146;ai-chan. I love you---&#148;

&#147;I love you too, my precious---&#148;

-----

&#147;Looks like the kids got the hang of making out while flying.&#148; 
Mi&#146;shari chides as she flies up near Trina. &#147;Think that thing knows 
it&#146;s pilot is off to her own little dream land within a land of 
dreams?&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s not push our luck---&#148; Trina sighs, &#147;---anyway, the valley&#146;s 
just ahead so we&#146;ll be touching down shortly. So---&#148;

&#147;So let&#146;s hope those two are back to reality when we do touchdown, 
neh?&#148;

&#147;Sure, Rei-chan, whatever. Like you never been seen spazzing while in 
flight.&#148;

With that Mi&#146;shari kicks her wing forward into high drive, leaving the 
others behind while she scouts ahead for the festival. &#147;Phht. I&#146;m not 
that bad--- am I?&#148;

&#147;You have been known to be rather dreamy faced while training.&#148;

&#147;Have NOT! I&#146;m focused! I am!&#148;

&#147;Uh-huh.&#148;

Reika looks down at the forests as the trees shift from Choco to 
Mallow trees, &#147;Wonder if it&#146;s too early in the relationship to 
threaten Trina with a night on the couch.&#148;

-----

As the Mallow trees come into view, Kismet lets out a low whistle of 
admiration. &#147;They&#146;re huge! So many trees!!&#148; Suddenly inspiration hit&#146;s 
the girl right between the eyes, prompting her to lean forward to 
drive their mount faster. &#147;Meh&#145;ai-chan? What are you doing?&#148;

&#147;Mallow Valley&#146;s right below us, the festival can&#146;t be too far off! 
So, let&#146;s give the crowds something to get excited about!&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t say that! Think big or go home! That&#146;s our new motto for 
today!&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t that a line from Hamtaro?&#148;

&#147;AMI-CHAN!!&#148;

Ami blushes as she lowers her head and gives Kismet a slight nod 
giving her approval, &#147;ALRIGHT AMI-CHAN!! THAT&#146;S MY GIRL!! LET&#146;S 
ROCK!!&#148;

&#147;---I have a bad feeling about this---&#148;

-----

Suddenly the cat-beast Kismet/Ami is on shoots forward quickly, 
leaving Trina/Reika behind.

&#147;W-wh-what are they doing?!?&#148; Trina gasps, as Reika&#146;s eyebrows furl in 
frustration. &#147;HEY! Wait up!! Don&#146;t---&#148; (sighs) &#147;---they&#146;re out of 
earshot already. Damn.&#148; (Reika&#146;s teeth clench as she fumes in her 
place on Trina&#146;s back) &#147;That damned Kizzy! She&#146;s going to get the two 
of them killed if she keeps going on like a lunatic every time there&#146;s 
an audience for her to show off in front of!&#148;

As the two watch, sweat dropping, the cat-beast goes into a complex 
set of aerial maneuvers over the festival, making complex turns and 
spins while keeping the two riders safely on it&#146;s back. Each loop, 
dive, spin, barrel roll, and dive brings a loud roar from the crowds 
below (unaware that this wasn&#146;t a planned part of the festival). 
Reika, however, is not one of the two girls fans as Trina draws closer 
to the festival grounds. &#147;What a bloody showoff! Damn idiot could have 
gotten little Ami-chan killed! There&#146;s no sense of responsibility or 
proper conduct in that girl at all! And they&#146;re such---&#148; (everything 
suddenly goes dark) &#147;---funny. It&#146;s daylight all the---&#148;(**) (looks up 
to see the girl&#146;s cat beast spiraling towards them, in the middle of a 
complex stunt that they weren&#146;t paying attention to (location wise). 
&#147;---AHH!!&#148;

The two beasts collide, dropping all three riders and their mounts 
into the largest Mallow Berry Pie in the whole Central Hub. All in all 
it was a rather interesting sight, and the fall did kick up a lot of 
pie all over the place dousing nearby viewers in Mallow Berry Pie. 
From her spot where she saw everything, Mi&#146;Shari sighs as she watches 
the crowds disperse from the scene of the crash (to clean off). &#147;Never 
a dull moment with those two---&#148; (face faults) &#147;---sadly.&#148; (sigh).

-----

Reika, obviously, is not a happy camper about the whole situation. As 
she shakes off some of the excess pie, noticing she was waist deep in 
pie filling, she began to grumble and curse under her breath. Off to 
one side is Ami, covered in pie (so that only her eyes are visible) as 
she floats in the pie filling looking dazed by the entire incident. To 
one side of Reika is Trina, her whole body from head to tail covered, 
her wings saturated, her eyes the only thing showing beneath a sugary 
furry coating of blue. &#147;Ouch.&#148;

At this moment, Kismet (the most damning grin on her face) chooses to 
surface, about as excited as she could be about the whole thing. 
&#147;YEAH!! THAT WAS COOL!! LET&#146;S DO IT AGAIN!! LET&#146;S DO IT AGAIN!! 
LET&#146;S---&#148;

&#147;KISMET!!&#148;

She stops, turns, looking right into Reika&#146;s smoldering eyes and 
vicious expression. Quickly Kismet dives back under the filling, 
gasping &#147;Oops!&#148; as she does. Reika looks down and sighs. &#147;Knowing her 
(and her large lungs considering how she&#146;s good at talking people to 
death) she could stay down there for hours and not surface---&#148; (Kismet 
bobs back up to the surface gasping for breath) &#147;---then again---&#148;

It takes the girls a few minutes to get out of the huge disaster that 
was once a pie. Leading to the next challenge, mainly cleaning up. But 
Reika didn&#146;t want to deal with it because she was still fuming from 
the crash, and it seemed Reika would be in a bad mood for the rest of 
the day. That theory, of course, ended rather quickly when Trina 
started licking the gooey tasty substance off of her, bringing the 
human down onto her back laughing and giggling like mad under her 
dragon&#146;s tongue attack. &#147;STOP IT!! GOD STOP IT!! BWAHH!! I--&#148; (giggle) 
&#147;--I CAN&#146;T--&#148; (laughs) &#147;--TAKE IT!!&#148; (breaks into a torrent of 
laughter that brings tears to her eyes).

Meanwhile, Kismet is having a time arguing with a bathhouse owner. &#147;No 
I don&#146;t want to use the public baths! I don&#146;t like mixed baths, 
alright? I want to rent the place out for an hour so we can bathe!!&#148;

Eventually with some effort, and a little money from Mi&#146;Shari (who was 
rich enough to buy a thousand bath houses and then some) the girls 
finally get the house to themselves to clean off. After showering (and 
using several showers to clean off Trina&#146;s huge surface area) all the 
girls (Trina in her half human form) soak off the landing while 
Mi&#146;Shari just soaks because she likes bath houses.

&#147;Kizzy strikes again.&#148;

&#147;You still blaming me for this, Rei? What a sore head you are.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not like I&#146;m saying something new that hasn&#146;t happened before. 
Especially since a majority of our little &#147;accidents&#148; can be 
attributed to you personally.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s my fault too!&#148; Ami speaks up, &#147;I shouldn&#146;t have encouraged 
Kismet. I&#146;m at fault too.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not your fault, Ami. Kizzy&#146;s always been like this!&#148;

&#147;Stop harassing Ami-chan! If Trina was watching where she was going we 
wouldn&#146;t have had a collision in the---&#148;

&#147;If you weren&#146;t screwing around up there then there wouldn&#146;t have---&#148;

&#147;KIIYYAAAHHH!!!&#148; The noise, high pitched and screeching, scares 
everyone. Everyone stops and spins around to look at Mi&#146;Shari. 
&#147;WHAT?!?&#148; At this Mi&#146;Shari stops stretching, and looks at the four 
girls oddly, realization slowly dawning on her. &#147;Oh. Nothing. Just 
couldn&#146;t stand listening to you two bitch and whine anymore. So I 
yawned.&#148;

Reika sweat drops, &#147;Some yawn.&#148;

&#147;Kitty needs her daily feeding of human flesh?&#148;

&#147;Shut it, Kizzy.&#148;


-----

After an hour bathing they still smelled like Mellow Berries. Just as 
well since it was a Mellow Berry festival so pretty much everything 
smelled like Mellow Berries. Still, Reika lost her appetite for 
chicken since it tasted like somebody drowned the chicken in Mellow 
Berries before cooking it in Mellow Berry oil and dusting it with 
Mellow Berry flour and dried Mellow Berries.

&#147;Can&#146;t get that taste out of my mouth.&#148; she grumbles.

&#147;It&#146;s not the fall&#145;s fault. EVERYTHING has Mellow Berries in it. Even 
the beer.&#148;

(stops and stares at Trina with a rather unshocked, Spock like 
expression) &#147;Well that&#146;s both truly and honestly disturbing of them. I 
like the stuff, but not stuffed into replicated imitation dead animal 
products (the theme of the festival should only go so far!)&#148;

&#147;Is all the snack foods made with Mellow Berries, Trina?&#148;

&#147;&#146;Fraid so, Ami. I&#146;d stick to the desserts, fried pastries and drinks. 
Maybe the sweet &amp; sour ribs because Mellow Berries make a good sweet 
sauce.&#148;

&#147;Ladies? How can we possibly want more of this stuff after nearly 
drowning in it? Me? I landed before the collision so I didn&#146;t take a 
berry bath (and you guys stay away from me for awhile because your 
beginning to make my senses go numb from berry overload).&#148;

&#147;Knew we should have drowned the catgirl in the pie before we got 
out.&#148;

Mi&#146;shari frowns at Reika, &#147;You have my senses and see if you can 
handle it!&#148; (scowls) &#147;I mean really! What kind of pie was that anyway 
besides being overloaded with---&#148;

&#147;CREAM PUFF SQUADRON FOUR!!&#148;

Everyone stops, and turns towards the source of the yell. Behind them, 
a small boy dashes off pointing backwards at them, all the time 
yelling &#147;CREAM PUFF SQUADRON FOUR!!&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; Mi&#146;shari sniffs the air again, &#147;He&#146;s right. There is a hint of 
cream puff in the air.&#148;

Kismet pushes Mi&#146;shari aside as she walks past, &#147;Stop sniffing me! 
Makes me think you&#146;re a damn dog or ham-ham the way you sniff the air 
like that! Go find someone&#146;s butt to sniff in greeting dammit.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s what dogs do, dummy.&#148;

&#147;You no woof-woof, Mishy?&#148;

&#147;----&#148; (Mi&#146;shari&#146;s eyes suddenly spin back towards the boy) &#147;---what 
about---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a harmless thing. Don&#146;t think much about it.&#148; Reika casually 
comments, looking about at the selections of food about them, &#147;Kizzy&#146;s 
right though, I could go for a bite to eat.&#148;

&#147;After being a bite to eat---?&#148; (Mi&#146;shari looks about scanning the 
booths as she does) &#147;Let&#146;s split up and relax.&#148; (walks off) &#147;Maybe 
I&#146;ll actually start smelling something other than Berries if I walk 
far enough away from you guys.&#148;

&#147;Whatever.&#148; The remaining girls split into two groups of two apiece.

After sampling some of the food booths, Reika stops off at one of the 
gaming booths (an archery booth) and gives the long bow a try. But the 
bow, meant for tall elfin types, is too big for her. As hard as she 
tries she ends up struggling to draw the arrow back. &#147;Damn--- this 
isn&#146;t as--- easy as--- it looks----&#148; suddenly the string slips from 
her fingers, sending the projectile glancing off the targets at an 
awkward angle, shattering against a gargoyle vendor selling snacks 
(much to the vendors surprise).

&#147;---uh boy---&#148; (Reika slowly walks away blushing)

At another booth, Kismet palms through a few of the Cds on display, 
looking for new music to SpellThrash by, while she does that she also 
shares a little small talk with red mage (abit shorter than Kismet) as 
she browses his selection. &#147;It&#146;s been awhile, Paku, so how are 
things?&#148;

&#147;Oh fine. Couldn&#146;t be better. How that&#146;s beautiful daughter of yours? 
Still---&#148;

&#147;Yes, still---&#148; Kismet blushes slightly at the remark, &#147;---it&#146;s like a 
beautiful dream.&#148;

&#147;Speaking of which have you met my lovely wife?&#148; (turns towards the 
elf girl working the counter, whose a full foot taller than Paku. Her 
auburn hair flows down her back as she turns, her smile radiant like 
the sun and her eyes sparkling with energy and youthful spunk. Clearly 
the bright, shiny eyes of a young girl barely in her 70s! Those young 
elves! &#147;This is my lovely wife Trinket! Trinky? This is my friend 
Kismet.&#148;

Trinket smiles, sliding forward gracefully to embrace Trinket much to 
the latter&#146;s shock.

&#147;Oh Paky! She&#146;s trembling! Is she in love with me?&#148;

Quickly Kismet shakes her head, shivering in her strong grip, &#147;NO! I&#146;m 
just--- well--- surprised--- I mean Paku--- and you--- being so bold 
and--- (let me go will you?)--- so--- I mean you---&#148;

Trinket releases Kismet, gently sliding backwards next to Paku 
giggling abit, &#147;Don&#146;t worry! I&#146;m strictly a one love elf myself. I 
just love my precious little Paku! Don&#146;t I, sweetie?&#148;

&#147;You bet Trinky my big tall love machine, you!&#148;

Kismet feels rather faint, mostly from the babble. &#147;Ugh. I&#146;m going now 
so you two can make out beneath the bench or something--- eww--- see 
ya&#146; around, Paku.&#148;

&#147;Bye!&#148; (turns back to Trinket) &#147;---oh Trinky---&#148;

(sounds of kissing and fondling reaches Kismet&#146;s ears) &#147;Get a tent or 
something you two! Sheesh!&#148;

&#147;Hey Kismet!&#148;

Another voice catches her attention, as she turns towards another mage 
(blue). &#147;Hey Donelly. How&#146;s aquatic magic doing for you lately?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s doing fine. How are things? Are you---&#148;

Kismet waves him off without another word, &#147;Why did I have to run into 
the few people who know all on the same day? Anyone else want to come 
and ask? Yes. We&#146;re still lovers. Give it a break.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not here to harass you.&#148; Donelly assures her as he walks next to 
Kismet, &#147;I just want to see how your doing. That&#146;s all.&#148;

&#147;Well now you know. Anything else?&#148;

&#147;---she&#146;s the world to you, isn&#146;t she?&#148;

Kismet stops, and for the first time today she didn&#146;t know what to 
say. &#147;You know she is.&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t that enough, then?&#148;

&#147;Not by some standards. I mean they won&#146;t understand what it&#146;s like. I 
mean. They can&#146;t---&#148; (sighs) &#147;Never mind. I&#146;m rambling. Probably need 
to eat, or drink, or something. Anything else?&#148;

&#147;What happened after you two ran off? Why did you never return home?&#148;

Kismet walks away without answering.

-----

Trina wandered aimlessly about the festival. Sampling food here and 
there, looking at things, but not really doing much. Her mind was just 
far too occupied with her own busy thoughts. 

&#147;Need a little good advice?&#148;

Trina&#146;s thoughts come to a stop as the voice snaps her out of her 
thinking. She turns about, her eyes falling upon a booth/tent manned 
by a short young woman with an addictive smile, her short strawberry 
blonde hair rolling just past her ears to barely brush against her 
shoulders. &#147;Like the sign says, good advice free to all. And you look 
like you could use some good advice.&#148;

&#147;But I---&#148;

&#147;Come on! A big strong strapping dragon girl like yourself shouldn&#146;t 
be afraid of little old me! I won&#146;t bite! Promise!&#148;

&#147;W-who are you?&#148; Trina stammers, walking up cautiously, &#147;What&#146;s with 
the free advice?&#148;

&#147;I was blanking on a theme for my booth and somebody already did the 
dunking booth and kissing booths (and the kiss the girl in the wet 
t-shirt after being dunked booth), so I went for good advice.&#148; 
(motions for Trina to follow her into the tent) &#147;It might not be the 
best advice, but it&#146;s pretty good I&#146;d say.&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148;

&#147;Come on. Think of me as a friend. Someone looking out for your best 
interest. Think of me even as your big sister!&#148;

&#147;Must I?&#148;

&#147;Didn&#146;t have a great sibling relationship, eh?&#148; (girl shrugs) &#147;Well, 
NOT every girl can grow up  with an incest-ful love for big sis I 
suppose.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s incest?&#148;

&#147;----never mind---&#148; (clears throat as she walks Trina into her tent, 
which looks like a large bedroom complete with bed filled with stuffed 
animals and so forth.

&#147;Uhh--- miss? We&#146;re not going to--- I mean I&#146;m spoken for.&#148;

&#147;No problems.&#148; (jumps on bed) &#147;So, dragon lady, what&#146;s troubling you.&#148;

Trina sighs, lying down next to the strange girl (picking up a little 
furry dragon toy as she does) &#147;Everything&#146;s happening so fast. Reika 
being in love with me, our relationship--- I&#146;m scared.&#148;

&#147;Of what?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know---&#148; Trina sighs irritably as she bounces the toy up and 
down watching it with weary eyes, &#147;It feels abit hard to adjust to 
what&#146;s going on. Everything&#146;s going so fast. I&#146;m in love with Reika 
but I&#146;m scared too. I just don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#147;I bet she&#146;s scared too. She so wants to love you but she&#146;s afraid 
she&#146;s not woman enough for you. She sometimes thinks she can&#146;t measure 
up.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s how I feel. But I also feel as if she&#146;d be better off with a 
humanoid. I mean--- what if she gets hurt--- or worst--- because of 
me? There&#146;s so many who see dragons keeping human lovers as being 
unnatural. They see humans as nothing more important to us as a form 
of sex toy, and that&#146;s wrong. Reika&#146;s not just something I&#146;m using to 
get off! Hell, we haven&#146;t even consummated yet! I really love her 
but--- I don&#146;t want her to be hurt by the bigotry of some of my kind. 
I don&#146;t want her to suffer because of me.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t feel brave enough?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not just that, I don&#146;t want to see her hurt--- I love her too 
much!&#148;

&#147;Here.&#148; (girl reaches over and draws out a mirror) &#147;Look into this 
mirror.&#148;

&#147;What is it?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a mystical piece of scrying glass placed into a rather ornate 
metal frame meant for looking into one&#146;s inner self, but that&#146;s not 
important right now. It&#146;s a metaphysical show and tell thing, don&#146;t 
worry about it. Just look inside.&#148;

Slowly, reluctantly at first, Trina reaches out and takes the mirror&#146;s 
handle and draws it towards her. As she peers into it she gazes into 
herself.

She remembers her youth, when she was old enough to know that 
humans/dragons don&#146;t usually marry and fall in love. She learned how 
her mom married her human husband at first to save her unborn child, 
but as she lived with him she slowly felt guilty about marrying him 
without love and began to feel love for him as he selflessly cared for 
her and her child. Trina knew her parents didn&#146;t consummate until she 
was three. Three years of his undying love and her slow acceptance of 
his love. Sometimes she wondered how it would have felt to been her 
father, waiting so patiently for her mother to love him as much as he 
loved her. Then she thought of Reika. Could she be the lover Reika 
wanted her to be? She felt so unsure she could be the best lover she 
could be for Reika. Doubts plagued her quite abit.

When she first moved into Reika&#146;s room she noticed the girl used a 
dark sphere for sleeping since it never grew dark on the central hub. 
The first night she was scared, she never slept with the use of a dark 
sphere (she always fell asleep in full daylight), and Reika wanted to 
cuddle her. She was highly resistant though and she only felt that she 
was hurting Reika by her reluctance. The next day Reika said it was 
OK, but she couldn&#146;t stop wanting to hold Trina, and Trina knew it.

&#147;Everyone has bouts of fear or reluctance. It&#146;s not bad. And it&#146;s not 
bad to feel uncertain about your ability to be a lover to Reika. It&#146;s 
how you deal with your fears and feelings that makes the difference.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know how to. I&#146;m just--- awkward with my feelings.&#148;

&#147;I know.&#148; (silence) &#147;How&#146;s your mother &amp; father now?&#148;

&#147;Happy as husband and wife can be. She stays in her human form a lot 
now and they&#146;re so close it&#146;s beautiful. But if mother didn&#146;t take a 
chance to fall in love it never would have happened.&#148;

&#147;How about you? Do you want to take a risk in love?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t like taking risks. I like sure things. Love isn&#146;t something I 
want to leave to chance.&#148;

&#147;There&#146;s no certainties in life. It&#146;s all chance and circumstance 
which make up our living. One day we could be the happiest people in 
the world, the next the most miserable. Money, fame, love, family--- 
it&#146;s all so fleeting. It&#146;s there one day, as certain as the sun rising 
and setting in the waking world, the next it&#146;s gone. Even if we&#146;re 
very careful of our precious things they have a tendency to go away 
without us wanting it to happen. Do you know what&#146;s worst than being 
uncertain in love?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s being in love and knowing there isn&#146;t a thing you can do to make 
him or her feel the same. No matter how badly you feel for them, or 
how much your in love you know it&#146;s inevitable that he or she will 
have only a distant to undesirable reaction to you and never feel the 
way you feel about them. That&#146;s what they call unrequited love. When 
you love someone even if you know they&#146;ll never be able to return that 
love you hold in your heart for them. It&#146;s not right, and it hurts, 
but it&#146;s a form of love no matter how distant and painful it is for 
the person feeling it.&#148; (sighs) &#147;That&#146;s worst.&#148;

&#147;But I--- I won&#146;t---&#148;

&#147;Tell her how you feel. Let her decide if you two are truly compatible 
or not. And if your uncomfortable with a certain degree of intimacy 
tell her, let her know you want time to deal with it.&#148;

&#147;I---I see.&#148;

&#147;No. You don&#146;t. Have you consummated yet? Lost your---&#148;

&#147;Yes. But not my choice. I--- was in heat and he---&#148;

&#147;I see.&#148; (girl rolls over on bed and gazes at Trina) &#147;It&#146;s not that 
simple, is it? Getting over it, I mean. It&#146;s not like losing your 
lunch money, or a favorite CD. When you lose your innocence--- you 
lose it for life, and nothing in the worlds both waking &amp; dreaming can 
bring it back to you--- nothing.&#148; The girl sighs as she rolls onto her 
back again, staring listlessly at the tent ceiling) &#147;According to an 
old survey of boys some years ago, a lot of High School aged boys were 
asked if it would ever be acceptable to force a girl to have--- well, 
have sex. Over half of the boys surveyed? They said yes.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s awful.&#148;

&#147;And the worst thing is they funded that poll on taxpayer money! 
Sheesh. Pork!&#148;

Trina blinks in confusion, &#147;Pork? You mean how they said they&#146;d 
pork---&#148;

&#147;I meant Government pork. As in waste, not--- never mind (I don&#146;t even 
know how you learned things like that anyway!)&#148;

&#147;I watch a lot of Cable like Showtime and---&#148;

&#147;Oh. Never mind.&#148; (girl clears throat) &#147;Reika must feel a bit 
frustrated. You let a male have you but you push away her attempts to 
show love to you. Let her know it&#146;s not her fault, that you want to 
love her but---&#148;

&#147;No buts.&#148; Trina whispers, &#147;I can&#146;t do it anymore. I&#146;m going to love 
her more boldly. Throw caution to the wind. Your RIGHT! I already had 
a male take me against my will, the least I can do is start showing my 
feelings more strongly towards her (the only person who really loved 
me that wasn&#146;t related to me)! I&#146;m going to do it! I&#145;m going to take 
that woman in my arms and show her how much I love her! I&#145;m going to 
do it! No more reluctance! I&#145;m in love and I&#145;m going to show the world 
how I feel!&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s good for you--- wasn&#146;t related--- you didn&#146;t---&#148;

Trina runs out of the tent before she can finish her question.

&#147;---never mind.&#148;

-----

Reika, the only one of the four girls (not counting Ami or Mi&#145;Shari) 
not embroiled in self discovery or having her past sneak up her at 
this moment, walks about casually munching on yet another fried thing 
she found being served at one of the booths. &#147;Can&#146;t be real possum. 
Possums don&#146;t live in this part of the Realm.&#148; Reika mutters, taking 
another bite out of the meaty confection. &#147;Maybe it&#146;s an import.&#148;

&#147;OK! We found a replacement! Let&#146;s go!&#148;

&#147;Eh?&#148;

On one of the entertainment stages a chorus line of dancing elfin 
girls (doing a Rockettes style routine) strut onto stage high kicking 
as they go. One of the girls is a very familiar looking human girl, 
which makes Reika stop in her tracks (completely forgetting about the 
possum in her hand). &#147;Ami??&#148;

&#147;Where?&#148; Kismet asks, walking up to notice Ami on stage kicking away 
in her borrowed costume. Kismet watches awe struck as Ami follows the 
other girls&#146; lead on stage, kicking with strength and vigor. &#147;That&#146;s 
my girl!&#148; Kismet whispers to herself as she watches, abit teary eyed. 
&#147;I&#146;m so proud of her!&#148;

&#147;Oh lighten up!&#148; Reika moans, taking another bite of the food, &#147;You 
act like she&#146;s your daughter or something!&#148;

&#147;----&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;N-n-nothing!! Nothing. She&#146;s my lover after all. I should be proud of 
her! Your proud of Trina aintcha?&#148; Briefly Reika thinks of Trina, 
kicking it up (wings twitching nervously because she hates performing 
in front of crowds), knocking a few girls over with her overexcited 
wings--- &#147;Right.&#148;

&#147;She certainly can high step it can&#146;t she?&#148; (Trina)

&#147;Hey, Trina. How---&#148; Trina moves quickly up and kisses her love hard, 
causing her to shudder visibly (from the shock) as they French kiss 
right in front of everyone. After a long drawn out kiss, Trina 
separates leaving Reika shivering in her grip. &#147;Sorry. I&#146;m feeling 
like a new girl and---&#148; (munch munch) &#147;---mmmm. Chicken.&#148;

&#147;Chicken? That rat bastard said it was possum! I---&#148; (blinks) 
&#147;Changed?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m a new girl! Your going to see a lot more of that later--- in 
bed.&#148;

&#147;---gulp---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t worry--- I&#146;ll be gentle---&#148;

&#147;----&#148; (silent from shock)

-----

After a few minutes to get Reika to calm down the three go backstage 
to see Ami after the performance. &#147;Oh, so that&#146;s why Rei went so white 
all of a sudden.&#148; Ami sighs, &#147;I thought you could see up my skirt or 
something!&#148;

&#147;Nope. Not that I wouldn&#146;t have minded---&#148; Kismet joshes, tagging Ami 
on the arm, &#147;So how was it? Was it as fun as it looked?&#148;

&#147;It was fun! I never had that much fun performing in front of people!&#148;

Kismet smiles, thinking back abit, &#147;Yeah. The last Academy Talent show 
was abit stressful.&#148;

Ami was in a play with her class and she had a fair role in it, but 
Kismet had to help her through the performance because she kept 
freezing up and needed Kismet to &#147;speak&#148; her lines for her through a 
clever use of a few good spells. &#145;Still---&#146; (Kismet thought to 
herself) &#145;---we did steal the show didn&#146;t we?&#146;

As everyone talked the dancing girls passed out drinks, and joined in 
on the conversation, bonding as they did with their new friends. 
Suddenly however the sound of screams breaks the good mood.

&#147;What the?&#148; Reika mutters, a tad pissy at the interruption, as she 
walks to the tent opening. &#147;What the hell is going on out---&#148; (stops) 
&#147;---uh boy.&#148;

Outside, a group of skeletal things and dark shadow armors skulk 
about, knocking things over and making a chaotic scene outside. People 
scattering, screaming, lots of fear.

&#147;Darklings.&#148; Reika sighs, &#147;They&#146;re here to wreck the festival and 
cause fear and panic.&#148; Slowly Reika turns, looks at the others, and 
motions for them. &#147;Alright everyone, let&#146;s go.&#148;

&#147;Right! You lead the way, boss!&#148;

&#147;---Let&#146;s go AWAY! Come on, there&#146;s a nice movie showing in town 
nearby and---&#148;

Everyone faints.

&#147;WHAT?!? REIKA!!!&#148;

&#147;What!&#148; (motions outside) &#147;It&#146;s NOT like it&#146;s something special! 
Drunken bands of dark malevolent forces of evil ALWAYS pop up around 
festivals! It&#146;s NOTHING SPECIAL! Sheesh! You act like you never seen 
an Anime where something like this happens! It&#146;s old school boring!&#148; 
(waves for everyone to follow her again) &#147;Let&#146;s go get dinner, watch a 
movie, forget about it! They&#146;ll shamble off again and nobody gets 
hurt. It&#146;s a waste of time---&#148; (looks as the others head out) &#147;---and 
nobody&#146;s listening to me. Ah, well.&#148; (looks back at girls) &#147;Want to 
run screaming in terror?&#148;

&#147;No thanks, we have another show in 30 minutes.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148; (shrugs) &#147;Whatever.&#148; (Reika sighs as she walks out after the 
others). &#147;Why can&#146;t we ever just leave well enough alone like I always 
want to? I mean really---&#148;

-----

Kismet puts her headset on, cranking the volume high as she hold her 
arms out and begins the work of SpellThrashing. To the high pounding 
beat and thrum of the music in her ears she weaves a set of spells, 
first defensive, then offensive, as she starts to take out enemies 
left and right as they come at her.

&#147;TOO SLOW!! TOO SLOW!! LOSERS ARE WAY TOO SLOW!! CRANK IT ABIT!!&#148;

Playing it light and fast, Kismet focuses on easy spells like fire 
shot, burning missile, and so forth. Nothing too fancy, just nice 
simple crowd pleasers to keep the dark things at bay. 

Ami grabs a weapon from a exhibit of weapons and goes into them, 
slashing each one as they come at her. Trina, in her human form, also 
takes up a weapon and starts fighting as Reika joins her (sword in 
hand). &#147;Change forms! Roast them!&#148;

&#147;Can&#146;t!! Too many people around us! I might hit an innocent by 
accident if I start laying down heavy energy blasts!&#148;

Mi&#146;Shari cartwheels and kicks about the field, knocking undead and 
dark things down easily. &#147;Well, it&#146;s not like we need it! They&#146;re 
pushovers!&#148;

&#147;Right! We can handle this!&#148; Kismet smiles, turning her attention to a 
new wave of attackers, weaving a new spell, &#147;Dispell UNDEAD!!&#148; (the 
creatures crumple into dust under the intense light of the spell, 
returning back to the &#147;ground&#148; they came out of).

Reika starts weaving her own runes, casting her Guardian discipline, 
thunder magic. From her hands she unleashes waves of electrical 
energy, stopping the armored creatures in their tracks and shattering 
the skeletal Darklings. Mi&#146;Shari &amp; Ami moves through their ranks, 
slashing each one down as another rises in it&#146;s place to take up the 
charge. However, from the rear of the waves of Darklings, something 
watches them. Sat perched on top of a huge statue, a dark armored 
figure looks on in interest.

&#147;Well that&#146;s good. Very nice---&#148; (shrugs) &#147;---very good.&#148; (leans back 
) &#147;Let&#146;s see how good.&#148;

From nowhere he draws a small deck of Rubicon nightmare prism cards. 
Each one imprisoning a darkling within it&#146;s facets. Flipping through 
his cards he draws a few, standing up from his lounging position. With 
a few waves of his free hand he sketches runes in the air, focusing 
his mind, &#147;Spell Shatter.&#148;

As the girls fight hard, their adversaries suddenly shatter, falling 
apart around them.

&#147;?&#148;

As the girls look about at the ruins of former enemies returned to 
dust and shadows, a darkness falls over them. &#147;Now wh--&#148; Reika starts, 
her voice trailing off as she looks up at their new adversary.

&#147;Do you know what this is?&#148; (holding the cards forward) &#147;Just 
checking. Don&#146;t mind me. I&#146;m just curious that&#146;s all. Nothing 
special.&#148;

The girls exchange glances as they ponder his weird question. &#147;Rubicon 
cards?&#148; Ami answers.

&#147;Yes. But, when put together like this---&#148; (pointing at the deck) 
&#147;---this set-up is called a Terroka Deck. It&#146;s used by disciples of 
the religion of the order of Nightmares. Lots of nasty stuff in here. 
Frights, horrors, daymares, etc. Not at all pleasant things for young 
girls to play with.&#148;

&#147;I had a dildo once people said wasn&#146;t nice for a girl like me to play 
with, and I loved it.&#148; Reika shoots back at him, only to get very odd 
stares from everyone. &#147;Say what?&#148; (Trina)

&#147;I have no idea what compelled you to say that. Honestly---&#148; (draws a 
card into his free hand, rotating it abit as he holds it) &#147;---each of 
these cards have the power of nightmares. People&#146;s fears, irrational 
paranoias, etc. You heard this before no doubt in Nightmare 101 back 
at your school. You ARE Academy students right?&#148; (waits for them to 
nod their heads) &#147;Thought so. The training shows. Most of the people 
here just ran mostly out of fear (or maybe boredom) but you girls 
stuck right out the minute you fought back.&#148; At this Reika hisses 
beneath her breath, causing everyone to blush. &#147;Told you we shouldva&#146; 
left.&#148;

&#147;Good advice.&#148; he remarks, listening in to Reika&#146;s words, &#147;Still---&#148; 
(with a whip of his arm he sends the card in his hand flying at the 
girls) &#147;---you better think fast!&#148;

As the card hit&#146;s the ground it explodes and releases a dark cloud.

&#147;It&#146;s a nice little darkling. It represents those who are rather prone 
to evil through acts of stupidity or of deception--- not particularly 
hard to beat but still a handful if you can&#146;t handle it.&#148; (waves) 
&#147;Ta-tah.&#148;

&#147;WAIT!!&#148; (as he teleports away he leaves the girls with a mess to 
clean up)

&#147;Oh, great.&#148; Kismet sighs, &#147;The clouds dissipating and it&#146;s nowhere to 
be found.&#148;

&#147;No darkling?&#148; Mi&#146;shari remarks, &#147;How anti-climatic.

Ami looks about, sweating abit from the workout and the stress. &#147;Maybe 
the card&#146;s a d---&#148;

The ground shatters, and an armored hand shoots upwards wielding a 
scythe. From beneath the ground, a horrific scream pierces the air.

&#147;---maybe not---&#148;

Notes &amp; Notations

(*) - Terra. Earth&#146;s &#147;dream moon&#148; counterpart in the Realm of Dreams.

(**) - There is no actual &#147;sunlight&#148; in the Realm of Dreams. The 
&#147;light&#148; seen on both Terra &amp; the central hub comes from the vast 
expanse of nothingness nicknamed &#147;ElseSpace&#148; (the &#147;hub&#148; between the 
waking world and the Realm of Dreams). The sky, however, only seems 
blue as the light of &#147;ElseSpace&#148; is filtered through the atmospheres 
of Terra/Central hub giving the sky a blue tinge. Hence that&#146;s why 
it&#146;s daylight 24/7 on the Central hub while there&#146;s both day/night on 
Terra. (Only a few hours after dusk and dawn can &#147;stars&#148; (other dream 
moons) be seen from Terra, otherwise the night sky is dominated by the 
Central hub hanging overhead).</pre>
