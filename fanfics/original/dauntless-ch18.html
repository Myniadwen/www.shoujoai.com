<p>“The Great Cooking Wars: I am the undefeated cooking champion!”</p>
<p>Ever  since the crew was shorn in half following the mission to Bibliopolis,  there had been an abundance of empty rooms on the ship, which was  fortunate for Marsa Rosemont, who had to charter one final voyage on  the Dauntless. She picked out a fairly nice room which quickly  accommodated itself to her humble tastes, and rested inside as she was  escorted back home. She was reluctant to hire the Ozmund Company, and  didn't trust any of the smaller businesses—lately there had been an  increase in raids and pirate activity. Staying here gave her a chance  to mingle with more interesting people anyway, even if most of them  were sporting a darker shade of gray. As she was resting on the journey  back, somebody came knocking at her door, and for awhile she thought it  was Alala. She made a face and took a reflexive step back as she saw  the Acheron twins peering at her instead, but gradually composed  herself.</p>
<p>&quot;You startled me. Is there something I can do for you?&quot;  The girls took turns informing her, their personalities bleeding  through each sentence: short and quiet for Kay, personal and rough for  Tee.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Miracle is asking for your presence. Well, it seems  that since you're such a special guest, and this is your last trip with  us, we've decided to send you off right. There's a cooking contest  being held in your honor. It's more like Riene's idea of settling an  argument—we just want you to be a judge. Chandra is listed as a chef,  but lately she's been neglecting her duties. Yeah, she even made a pass  at us—not that I'm complaining. Anyway, Fuuka and Rebecca have been  assuming her duties. This apparently made her believe she was losing  what little value she has! That's basically where we are, but several  other women are joining in. And we want you to help decide who's really  the best. We've been selected to be judges as well. Probably because  it'd be almost impossible to please us both!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see,&quot; she replied quietly. It had been difficult keeping up with both of them. &quot;It sounds fun. When does it start?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dr.  Miracle has requested your presence immediately. We've gotten everyone  else together.&quot; Marsa rose out of her chair and followed the twins to  the dining room.</p>
<p>&quot;So who will be competing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rachel and  Vimmy will announce that later. They've volunteered to be commentators  for this little show. They were quite insistent.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess they can answer all my other questions.&quot;</p>
<p>The  dining room and the kitchen of the Dauntless had been tricked out just  for this occasion. The spectators—those who would neither be cooking  nor judging—were seated in the dining room, three or four women to a  table, and were promised sample dishes from the top two winners. A  rectangular table was set between the dining room and the kitchen, and  it was here that Marsa and the twins sat down, next to the other two  judges. The kitchen itself was divided into six segments, with every  practical appliance and ingredient ready for the contestants. Only a  master chef could possibly recognize such a wide variety of tools and  tastes; to the casual observer, it looked like a silvery river of pans  and plates, and a rainbow of colors and tastes. Once Marsa and the  Acheron twins had settled in, the lights blacked out for a moment  before two spotlights shined down on the energetic hosts.</p>
<p>&quot;Welcome,  ladies and gentlemen--I mean, ladies and OTHER ladies, to the very  first annual Great Cooking Wars: I am the undefeated cooking champion!  We are your fashionable and upbeat hosts, Rachel the genie...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And  Vimmy Fonester, a professional entrepreneur who has sampled dishes from  all over the galaxy, my palate is too sophisticated for today's event,  so I've graciously stepped aside as judge, even though I did sponsor  this event and possess all right to measure the value of its  contestants, but I digress, I am here as Rachel's co-host, let's get  the good times rolling, shall we?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;(Psst, Vimmy!)&quot; Rachel whispered. &quot;(You're boring them to death! Just keep it short and simple!)&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  that's impossible for a woman of my position and influence, don't you  see, I have to express everything I can as quickly as possible to  achieve maximum dominance over my adversaries, it's a common trait in  my people and it's something we're all taught to excel at, you can't  expect me to forget a lifetime of teaching just like that, but I  digress once more, these good people have come to see a contest, I  think we should get things started, don't you agree?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Completely!&quot;  Rachel groaned. &quot;First off, I'd like to introduce our six brave  contestants! Hailing from Vulcannis, a Pyrosian with a penchant for  fire and creating wacky machines, it's Kyrie Lastgear!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next  comes my faithful servant Mink, a Yun from the planet Joff, and even I  cannot describe all her wonderful traits, but suffice to say she's  earned a place on this roster, and I dare say she'll prove more than  capable of holding her own!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Coming up next, the sexy, sweet,  sisterly doctor of the Dauntless, Athena's main squeeze and a rabid  anime fanatic, Dr. Fuuka 'Fuji-san' Fujiwara!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, and next we  have a heavyworlder from Utopia, it's a rather nasty planet so you know  she can fend for herself, would everybody please give it up for Kate  Shepherd, don't let her looks deceive you, she's actually a nice girl  once you get to know her, just not very rich, so she's not worth MY  time!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next we have the ship's sweetheart, that angelic weapons  modifier from New London who once saved her own life through the power  of cooking, give it up for Rebecca Hill!&quot;&quot;Finally, we have a  nymphomaniac who honestly can't go five minutes without undressing,  flirting, or having sex with SOMEONE, lord knows she's proposed a  session with me, and I just may take her up on her offer, erm, if  business allows, but now she's the current head cook and the main  reason we've all gathered here, you know her, you love her, unless  you're Herut, it's Chandra!&quot;</p>
<p>The spectators and judges all  clapped enthusiastically as the six chefs took their positions; some  even whistled. Rachel could easily fill a room with energy, and in  spite of her long-winded speeches, Vimmy was entertaining to watch as  she bounced around gesturing and chattering. The spotlights then fell  upon the four judges, whom the hosts introduced next.</p>
<p>&quot;A contest  of this proportion calls for a handpicked group of judges who will  fairly gauge the quality, appearance, and satisfaction of each dish.  Vimmy and I have scoured the Dauntless long and hard, and we've come up  with four of the most discerning minds and mouths around! First off is  Aseria Tolath, the Sindar from Alfheim. She's a very high-bred person  who prefers elegant dishes in small portions, but her favorite is  Sindarin Azoth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next we have Herut the maintenance unit, one  would think an artificial human would have no need for taste, but Herut  is quite a distinguished food critic in her spare time, why she  criticizes Chandra all the time, plus we can't overlook the fact that  she's become very popular recently, and so as far as this ship's  concerned, her word may as well be law!&quot;&quot;Our next special judge is  Kayleigh and Teleah Acheron, the twin pilots of the Dauntless! They  don't interact with the rest of the crew so much, but they've saved our  tails a number of times, so we owe them our gratitude! With two  distinct personalities and a single stomach between them, our  contestants will have to be very creative in order to satisfy their  tastes!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, we have our special guest judge, the former  high priestess of Tigris and a universally revered woman, the Lady  Marsa Rosemont, who we met on Tigris as Alala's mother was married and  who hired us to ferry her to Rajani, where we experienced our usual  brand of wacky hijinks, all thanks to her for this time she is  contributing—HOORAY!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Stop, you're embarrassing me,&quot; Marsa  grinned. The lights drew away from the judges back to the hosts, who  would now explain the rules of the contest.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that we have  introduced our brave contendors and the people who hold their destinies  in their mouths—“ (Let the record reflect that Chandra perked up when  she heard that) &quot;—we'll now go over the rules! Our six contestants have  just ninety minutes to make a three-course meal! APPETIZER! MAIN DISH!  DESSERT! When making these classic meals, the tastes of the judges must  be taken into consideration. Time is a factor, and with six rivals,  ingredients will be scarce!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've been told the last place loser  has to clean the entire kitchen for a week, while the first place  winner gets to be head chef for a whole month, so please take all that  into consideration, and Chandra has also asked me to tell everyone that  she will probably seduce the winner, unless she has won first place, in  which case she will seduce everyone, so keep this in mind as well.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damned if we do and damned if we don't, huh?&quot; Kyrie muttered.</p>
<p>&quot;Can't you be optimistic for once?&quot; Chandra grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not the act I loathe, but the principle.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But that's the sexiest part!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Can  we continue, please?&quot; said Rachel. Since Kyrie's face stayed red even  when she blushed and Chandra had no shame to speak of, their  expressions stayed the same as they let the commentators do their job.  &quot;Thanks so very kindly. Now, contestants! To your stations! This  contest begins in TEN SECONDS!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I really wasn't made to rush,&quot;  Fuuka sighed as she hurried to her post. The audience counted down the  seconds with fanatic zeal; Chandra wondered if it would be morally  permissible to cheat just to win first place. Then again, she'd be  happy even if she lost: all five of her rivals were incredible beauties  and would no doubt be vixens in the bedroom.</p>
<p>&quot;Three...two...one...GO!!&quot;</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like our contestants are off to a slow start, Vimmy.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes  that's right, except for Mink who is always so punctual and precise,  she's really a darling, but I'm afraid her knowledge of dishes is very  limited, while I've no doubt she's a good cook, she's never  disappointed me, the fact remains that she has very little experience  outside the simpler meals, and this might be her only weakness, the  others stand a good chance if they can exploit this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean all that time working for you and she never learned to cook anything complex?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well—no,  Rachel, not at all, but—I'm quite embarrassed to say this—I never gave  her a chance to, all her meals were superlative, now Chandra is in a  league of her own, I fear she'll give my Mink a run for her money.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  right, folks. If you're just tuning in, the pleasure unit known as  Chandra prefers creating intimate dinners and has a vast knowledge of  French cuisine. She's also skilled at a wide variety of desserts,  although to be fair, she uses this knowledge in sexual foreplay...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I do love a hot fudge sundae,&quot; Chandra said. &quot;Especially if it's slathered all over a beautiful woman!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's  what we call 'too much information' in the business world,&quot; Vimmy  muttered. &quot;But I have to admit, making meals for large groups is not  Chandra's forte, if she was making dinner for two, she'd be unbeatable,  now what do you think of Kate and Kyrie, dear Rachel, do they stand a  chance against their competitors?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kate's skill is average at  best, but she works quickly and she seems to know what other people  like. Growing up in a rough neighborhood has made her very independent,  so while the others might go a little slower, she can handle pretty  much any job on her own. As for Kyrie, well...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;BURN, BABY,  BURN!! I can't believe I get to play with so much fire! Things are  really starting to heat up in here! Gaah, I'm so happy, I'm ranting in  clichés! Turn the ovens on full blast and open up the boilers!  Bwahahahahahahaaaaaa!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The proof, as they say, is in the pudding,&quot; Rachel sighed. &quot;We'll be lucky if the kitchen doesn't burn down!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  you can't neglect her inventiveness, she could just as easily create  better appliances and have them do the work for her, why even an idiot  can make a decent meal if they have top-notch tools, so what is your  opinion of Fuuka, hmm?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's not very assertive,&quot; Rachel  pointed, &quot;but people respect her. She's very quiet, and yet she can get  people to listen. Athena has rated her cooking as 'excellent', and we  all know how difficult she is to please.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But she and Athena are  lovers, she's biased, Fuuka is a doctor and not a chef, she couldn't  have mastered two occupations, not in her lifetime, I've no doubt she'd  good but let's face it, she's slow and too methodical, she doesn't put  enough love in her dishes, and I believe the otaku in her will be her  undoing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can hear you,&quot; Fuuka muttered. She smiled to herself  and said, &quot;This is just like that episode of Mai Hime. I hope we're not  attacked by any cake monsters—and speaking of cake...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It looks  like Fuuka is starting on her dessert already!&quot; Rachel exclaimed. &quot;We  all know that if you do that, you'll just spoil your appetite. Does the  same apply to cooking as well?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll find out later, let's not  neglect Rebecca, remember she did save her own life by cooking an  exceptional meal, and you know these pirate warlords, they're nearly  impossible to satisfy, do you think she should trade in her bounty  hunter's license for an apron and spatula, I heard her mother's a  waitress, maybe that sort of thing runs in the family, but her weakness  seems to be other women.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right, Vimmy, and Chandra has  pulled out her ultimate weapon! She's taken off all her clothes and is  wearing only an apron! Will Rebecca be distracted? Will Fuuka force her  to wear an OSHA-approved uniform? Will Kyrie violate everything in an  orgy of flames and destruction? I CAN'T STAND THE SUSPENSE!!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  it seems their first meal is ready to be tested, with an hour to spare  for the other two dishes, can our contestants accomplish this difficult  task, and can they win the approval of the judges, let's see what they  think right now!&quot; And so, feeling so very left out, the judges quietly  ate the appetizers the contestants had made, and rated them according  to their individual tastes.For Kyrie's burnt clams...Marsa: tastes as  bad as it smells. Zero.Kay and Tee: could not get a single bite down.  Zero.Herut: Unfit for consumption. Zero.Aseria: crispy on the outside,  crispier on the inside. One.For Mink's garden salad...Marsa: a  surprising flavor and zing that penetrates my soul and sends shivers  down my spine. However, it's not very original. Four.Kay and Tee:  perfect with every bite. Five.Herut: Excellent! Five.Aseria: I had no  idea something so simple could be this magnificent! Five.For Fuuka's  shrimp-fried rice...Marsa: this woman definitely knows how to make  rice! Five.Kay and Tee: definitely fulfilling, and the flavor is great.  Four.Herut: Good. Three.Aseria: delightful to look at, but average in  the mouth. Three.For Kate's pigs in a blanket...Marsa: I only eat white  meat. One.Kay and Tee: parts of it were still cold; the rest felt dry  and flaky. Two.Herut: Not bad. Two.Aseria: this is a joke, right?  One.For Rebecca's sushi...Marsa: a wonderful, colorful variety.  Five.Kay and Tee: disgusting. Zero.Herut: Not bad. Two.Aseria:  delectable. I wish I had more. Five.For Chandra's foccaccia  dip...Marsa: the bread was just how I like it, while the dip  complimented it perfectly. Five.Kay and Tee: should spend less time  flirting and more time in the kitchen. Three.Herut: I hate to admit it,  but…great! Four.Aseria: a pedestrian meal that left me feeling empty.  Two.</p>
<p>“An interesting way to start off this competition, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Yes,  I agree Rachel, these judges clearly know what they’re looking for and  they expect these competitors to take the contest seriously, hmm, it  seems Mink is in the lead so far, I told you she was exceptional, her  specialty is ordinary dishes, hmm, but it seems Kyrie was a little <em>too</em> enthusiastic with the fire, yes, and burnt everything she had, what a shame!”</p>
<p>“I’d  have to agree with you, Vimmy, and it also seems that Kate’s a little  out of her element. She used comfort food as an appetizer, and what’s  worse, she didn’t completely cook it! You have to wonder what she was  thinking, using frozen food like that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but our judges are  not a forgiving group, and speaking of which, now it seems they’re  ready to deliver the main course, I wonder what new surprises our  aspiring chefs will bring out now, and will they find favor with our  elite critics, let’s watch!”</p>
<p>For Kyrie’s burnt chicken…</p>
<p>Marsa: is she <em>trying</em> to lose? Zero.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: blackened all the way through, but not in a good way. Zero.</p>
<p>Herut: Unfit for consumption…again. Zero.</p>
<p>Aseria: not nearly as nutritious as the plate she served it on. Zero.</p>
<p>For Mink’s stew…</p>
<p>Marsa:  a heavenly treat. Mink has somehow drawn out every molecule of flavor  from these humble dishes and created a masterpiece—but once again, it’s  not original. Four.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: scrumptious. Perfect once again. Five.</p>
<p>Herut: Excellent! Five.</p>
<p>Aseria: made me consider stealing her away from Vimmy. Five.</p>
<p>For Fuuka’s grilled salmon…</p>
<p>Marsa: delectable and wonderful to look at. Every bite was remarkable. Five.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: perfect, perfect, perfect. Easily a rival for Mink. Five.</p>
<p>Herut: Great. Four.</p>
<p>Aseria: she’s exceeded my expectations. Five.</p>
<p>For Kate’s lasagna…</p>
<p>Marsa: not outstanding, but definitely great. Four.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: overcooked in a few places. Three.</p>
<p>Herut: Excellent! Five.</p>
<p>Aseria: pitiful. Cat food would have been better. One.</p>
<p>For Rebecca’s Lifesaver, Junior…</p>
<p>Marsa: the dish she used to save her life lives up to my expectations. Five.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: the dish that tamed Gallows McGirk and our appetite. Five.</p>
<p>Herut: Good. Three.</p>
<p>Aseria: I really don’t see what the big deal is. Three.</p>
<p>For Chandra’s foie gras…</p>
<p>Marsa: too dry for my taste. Two.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: the presentation was VERY nice; the food was a letdown. Three.</p>
<p>Herut: Disgusting. One.</p>
<p>Aseria: a delight for all six senses. Five.</p>
<p>“Oh! Once again, Kyrie tanks out! It looks like the judges have already picked out their favorites!”</p>
<p>“Yes,  and once again I must sing the praises of my wonderful Mink, she really  is a great chef, but it is sad she can’t make complicated dishes, but  who cares, she beat everybody else, well, maybe not, Fuuka and Rebecca  are proving themselves very worthy rivals, one can only wonder what the  final round will hold!”</p>
<p>“It looks like we’ll just have to wait  and see. Well, there’s the bell, so now all chefs must stop whatever  they’re doing and present their final dishes. Will the judges favor  their desserts any differently? Will someone pull out an unlikely  victory? And when will the rest of us be fed?”</p>
<p>For Kyrie’s S’mores…</p>
<p>Marsa: FINALLY, Kyrie got something right! The wait was worth it. Five.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: we thought she was joking, but it turns out this girl can really cook. Five.</p>
<p>Herut: Excellent! Five.</p>
<p>Aseria: too sweet for my taste. Three.</p>
<p>For Mink’s blueberry pie…</p>
<p>Marsa:  flaky crust, tender filling bursting with juice, and the splash of  lemon was a surprise. Still unoriginal, but who cares? Five.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: Mink clearly has a gift for simple dishes. Five.</p>
<p>Herut: Excellent! Five.</p>
<p>Aseria: nothing was lacking. Five.</p>
<p>For Fuuka’s sacher torte…</p>
<p>Marsa: perfectly bittersweet, but a bit dry. Three.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: made us consume more milk than we’re used to. Four.</p>
<p>Herut: Good. Three.</p>
<p>Aseria: a perfect blend of bitterness and sweetness. Five.</p>
<p>For Kate’s mint ice cream…</p>
<p>Marsa: pretty good for hand-made. Four.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: her only exceptional dish in the lineup. Four.</p>
<p>Herut: Excellent! Five.</p>
<p>Aseria: boring, bland, and uninspiring. One.</p>
<p>For Rebecca’s sherbet and wafers…</p>
<p>Marsa: delightful! Five.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: Rebecca has great potential. Four.</p>
<p>Herut: Great. Four.</p>
<p>Aseria: a very classy dish that made me want more. Five.</p>
<p>For Chandra’s crepes…</p>
<p>Marsa: the chef was clearly distracted when she made this. Two.</p>
<p>Kay and Tee: melts right in your mouth. Five.</p>
<p>Herut: I loathe to admit it, but…excellent! Five.</p>
<p>Aseria: not a dish for everyone. Four.</p>
<p>“It seems all of our judges have a sweet tooth. That round really helped a lot of people, but will it be enough?”</p>
<p>“Now  the votes will be tallied and a winner will be selected, remember with  four judges and three dishes, the highest possible score would be a 60,  I’m afraid to say even my Mink is not perfect, but I’ll wager she’ll  score very high, but oh dear, if she does, that means Chandra will  pursue her, and heaven knows how my poor servant will take that, she’s  not sexually experienced at all, this could be trouble!”</p>
<p>“Not experienced, you say?” Chandra purred. “Hmm…looks like I might have to teach her a few things.”</p>
<p>“Drumroll, please!” Rachel exclaimed. The scores of all four judges for all three dishes were added up, and the results were…</p>
<p>Kyrie: 19</p>
<p>Kate: 32</p>
<p>Chandra: 41</p>
<p>Rebecca: 46</p>
<p>Fuuka: 49</p>
<p>Mink: 58</p>
<p>“We  have a winner!! Mink, you have been chosen as the ultimate undefeatable  cooking champion! That means you get to be head chef of the <em>Dauntless</em> for a whole month! Of course, that also means Chandra will try and seduce you.”</p>
<p>“I’ve  got a feeling I won’t have to ‘try’ very hard,” she giggled as she  cozied up next to the winner. As always, Mink showed no emotional  response, except for a tiny sliver of happiness and humility.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect to win. I just did what I usually did.”</p>
<p>“So  I guess this means I have to clean up for a week,” Kyrie groaned. She  took off her apron, tossed it away, sighed…then suddenly got a  dangerous glint in her eye as she realized how fun her new job could  be. “Of course, we all know that fire is the ultimate cleanser…”</p>
<p>KER-SMACK!</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare burn this hallowed sanctuary down!” Rebecca and Fuuka screamed.</p>
<p>“Aww, not even a little?”</p>
<p>“NO!!”  Kyrie moped and shuffled off to change into a janitor’s uniform, but no  sooner had she left did she come running back again, panicked and  terrified. “Holy fireballs, there’s a big…THING out there! It’s massive  and huge and alive and it…it’s after me!” There was certainly something  after Kyrie; it crashed through the dining room door and slithered  through the tables, frightening the audience away as it upset  everything in its path.</p>
<p>“What the hell IS that thing!?” Naja shrieked.</p>
<p>“It  looks like those tentacle creatures we saw on that asteroid,” Yenae  said. A piercing chill ran through her guts and she looked around,  wondering where a certain six-armed geneticist was. “Hey, has anybody  seen Valti? She’s not here!”</p>
<p>“Oh gods of Elshyrin, <em>please</em> don’t let this be what I think it is!” A distant cry of, “Hey, has  anybody seen a slightly overgrown creature anywhere?” confirmed Naja’s  fears, and she felt her stomach grow cold as Valti came into the dining  room, breathing heavily, drenched in a red goo that smelled  suspiciously like tomato sauce.</p>
<p>“Hey, is the contest over yet?”  she called cheerfully—then, observing the destruction and chaos before  her, she added, “Oh, there it is, you found it!” Several voices rang  out with furious rage, almost knocking her over.</p>
<p>“VALTI BRIGNOR, WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?!”</p>
<p>“Yikes,  I guess you don’t like my pet Banjo.” The monster went out of control,  lashing and smashing everything; it took the entire crew just to subdue  it.</p>
<p>“Banjo?! Valti, what the <em>fuck</em> is this monstrosity!?”</p>
<p>“It’s that tentacle-creature I brought back from the asteroid, remember?”</p>
<p>“Told ya,” Yenae groaned.</p>
<p>“Why the hell is it so big?”</p>
<p>“Well,  I…sort of spliced its genes with a fast-growing tomato plant, and then  I fed it several of Kyrie’s leftovers. You know, for all the burnt food  she makes, she’s really not that bad of a chef.”</p>
<p>“That explains the goo,” grinned the Pyrosian.</p>
<p>“Yeah,”  Valti giggled, “that thing had me in its grasp for a moment. It was  pretty stimulating, I must say, but way too sticky. I’ll have to take a  shower later.”</p>
<p>“Figures a freak like her would get turned on by  that sort of thing,” Naja muttered to herself. “So what’re you gonna do  about this monster, huh? It’s going to destroy the whole ship!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Banjo’s just playing with you—see? He likes you!”</p>
<p>“HE’S SQUEEZING THE AIR FROM MY LUNGS, YOU MORON!! DO SOMETHING!!”</p>
<p>“My  god, Naja! What have I unleashed?! Banjo, put her down now! I gave you  life, boy—why are you doing this?” The tentacle-beast threw Naja away  and smacked against several other girls before wrapping its  tomato-sauce coils around Kyrie, the Acheron twins, and Rebecca. Seeing  people she liked suffering on her account pushed Valti over the edge,  and she dove towards the flame thrower Kyrie always carried with her.</p>
<p>“That’s  it, boy,” she growled: “come get some!!” The fires burst out and fried  the tentacle to a crisp; it released its hostages and collapsed into a  dead, smoldering, yet disturbingly aromatic pile. Valti dropped her  weapon and fell to her knees, sobbing from the loss of her beloved pet.  “Damn it, why do we always hurt the ones we love? Why, Banjo, why?!”</p>
<p>“Uh, Val?”</p>
<p>“What is it, Kyrie?”</p>
<p>“Are you gonna eat that?” Sigh.</p>
<p>“I  suppose I could put in a late entry to the contest. Dig in, everyone.”  And so the crew feasted on Valti’s specialty, genetically altered  Kamikaze Calamari in tomato sauce, and declared it to be morbidly  delicious.</p>
<p>When the crew finally arrived at Marsa Rosemont’s home world, she couldn’t get away fast enough.</p>
