<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch37.html">Back to Part 37</a><pre>&quot;Jessie, why didn&#39;t you tell me something was wrong?&quot; Misty asked the 
sleeping girl, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you come to me?&quot; She buried her face in 
Jessica&#39;s shirt and let out a small sob, &quot;Why?&quot; 

&quot;Misty?&quot; Amy lightly set a hand upon the girl&#39;s back, &quot;Did you notice 
anything unusual about Jessica&#39;s behaviour this morning?&quot; 

Misty lifted her head and shook it, &quot;Not at first.&quot; Misty replied, 
gazing at Jessica affectionately, &quot;Last week she was fine, but recently 
she seemed more depressed and then she started hanging around with those 
new girls and I&#39;ve not seen her much since then. Today was the first 
time I got to talk to her in a while.&quot; 

&quot;Did she say anything?&quot; Amy probed, &quot;Anything at all?&quot; 

Misty shook her head, &quot;She did seem more down then usual.&quot; She 
explained, &quot;She took off pretty quickly after...&quot; She lightly flushed. 

Amy shook her head in dismay and patted the girl&#39;s head, &quot;You don&#39;t need 
to explain more.&quot; She turned to glance down at the redheads, &quot;I just 
wish I knew what those two are up against. I feel so helpless just 
standing around here.&quot; 

Just then the doors of the lobby opened and Natalie entered with a 
couple of boxes in hand, &quot;Could someone help me?&quot; She hollered as she 
struggled with the door. 

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Amy got to her feet and rushed over to hold the door for 
Natalie when she noticed Tanya and Cherilyn through the doors windows 
caring more boxes and stuffed backpacks slung over their arms, &quot;Misty 
could you help, please?&quot; She requested. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Misty quickly hurried over to Natalie, &quot;Hey Natalie, Let me take 
those.&quot; She offered, taking the top most boxes that were obstruction 
Natalie&#39;s view. 

&quot;Thanks, Misty!&quot; Natalie said grateful to be removed of some of her 
load. 

&quot;More new recruits?&quot; Misty inquired scanning Tanya and Cherilyn as they 
pushed through the doors. 

&quot;East Wing transfers.&quot; Natalie explained with a huff as she dropped the 
boxes on the floor near the stair then took the box from Misty. 

&quot;East Wingers, hmmmm...&quot; Misty examined the two girls as they placed 
their load next to Natalie&#39;s, &quot;And cute ones too. I&#39;m Misty, welcome to 
hotel hell.&quot; 

Amy let the door close, &quot;Misty don&#39;t tease them.&quot; She warned, &quot;This 
place is far from hell.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Amy.&quot; Misty apologized, &quot;Welcome all the same.&quot;

Cherilyn blushed as she dropped a duffle bag of clothes to the ground 
and stared at the girl in astonishment. Her eyes scanning over Misty&#39;s 
short skirt and tight blouse, noticing that only the two buttons in the 
middle was fastened revealing her tight stomach and breasts. Her clothes 
gave very little to the imagination showing the world her rather 
feminine, yet built, frame to anyone who dared to look. Never had 
Cherilyn seem anyone dress the way this girl did. Most of the East Wing 
girls that Cherilyn knew were self-conscious of their body in one way or 
another and tended to cover up in loose fitting clothes. Misty&#39;s fashion 
left Cherilyn lost for word. 

Tanya noticed the way her girlfriend was staring at Misty and rolled her 
eyes, &quot;You act like you&#39;ve never seen a pretty girl before.&quot; Tanya 
remarked crossly, giving Cherilyn a nudge, then flashed a quick smile to 
Misty, &quot;Sorry for my girlfriend&#39;s rudeness.&quot; She stressed the word 
&#39;girlfriend&#39; as she spoke, &quot;I&#39;m Tanya and the gawker would be Cherilyn.&quot; 
She introduced. 

&quot;I&#39;m not gawking!&quot; Cherilyn protested, &quot;I was just... just...&quot; 

Natalie let out a laugh and patted Cherilyn on the back, &quot;You&#39;d better 
be careful or you are going to be in the dog house very quickly.&quot; She 
stated with a grin. 

&quot;So you two are a couple then?&quot; Misty inquired, glancing between the two 
girls.

&quot;You could say that.&quot; Tanya stated, giving Cherilyn a glare, &quot;Am I 
right, Cherilyn?&quot; 

Cherilyn&#39;s blush brightened, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to stare.&quot; 

Natalie shook her head as she walked away, &quot;First day here and you are 
already in trouble.&quot; She remarked with a chuckle. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Tanya.&quot; Misty said with a warm smile, &quot;I will not chase 
your girl. Promise.&quot; She raised her hand in a salute, &quot;Girl Guild&#39;s 
honour.&quot; 

&quot;You didn&#39;t eat any of the Brownies, did you?&quot; Tanya inquired 
sceptically. 

Now it was Misty&#39;s turn to blush, &quot;Never!!&quot; She protested then saw Tanya 
smile, &quot;Oh you... So that is how you play things.&quot; She returned the 
smile and shook her head then glanced at Cherilyn, &quot;You better keep an 
eye on that one. The Western Dorm have been know to do things to the 
girl&#39;s here and it seems she has already been effected.&quot; 

Now Cherilyn was glaring at Tanya, &quot;I can see that.&quot; She replied 
irately.

&quot;Girls!&quot; Amy interrupted them, &quot;Please, try not to argue.&quot; 

&quot;Just playing Amy.&quot; Misty remarked, &quot;I&#39;m harmless.&quot; 

Amy rubbed her forehead, &quot;If you are harmless then I hate to met the 
dangerous ones.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s right there.&quot; Natalie pointed at Jessica, and then glanced down 
at the redheads, &quot;So they really did jump into their dreams.&quot; She 
remarked as she knelt next to the girls, &quot;I hope they know what they are 
doing...&quot; 

&quot;They are tough.&quot; Alyson replied, &quot;They will make it back.&quot; 

&quot;What makes you so sure of them all of a sudden?&quot; Natalie inquired 
sceptically. 

&quot;I looked into their heart.&quot; Alyson stated with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
fought with Kima. She isn&#39;t all that bad after all.&quot; 

Natalie smiled, &quot;Good to hear you&#39;ve changed your mind about her.&quot;

Amy glanced around the room, &quot;Where is Kris?&quot; She inquired. 

&quot;She went after them.&quot; Tanya explained miserably, &quot;With her sister. They 
said someone named Carey was involved.&quot; 

Amy sank heavy into a nearby chair, &quot;Carey? Oh god this is worse then I 
though.&quot; She remarked in dismally. &quot;I prey the lords will protect them 
because they will need every ounce of help then can get.&quot;
