When Spring Break finally came around, the teachers were just as eager 
for a vacation as the students were. In fact, most of them decided to 
pool their money together for something extravagant, and bought passes 
for a week-long getaway onboard an Olivia Cruise Ship&#151;designed, not 
unintentionally, for women. Except for Bernadette Marbel, who was 
spending the week quietly with her significant other, and Leena, who was 
flying to Finland to see her family, nearly all the teachers went on the 
cruise, thinking that, at the least, it would be a good way to shuck off 
all their stress.

DAY ONE

To start their vacation out on the right foot, each of the women were 
greeted by a beautiful Hawaiian girl wearing a semi-traditional island 
dress&#151;certainly no lei or grass skirt, but radiant all the same (the 
leis went to the guests, and ended up being traded, used as projectiles, 
or other &quot;interesting&quot; purposes). Then, when they all actually flocked 
together in a single group, they needed a moment just to take in the 
sights. A robust blend of calypso, hip-hop, and reggae music shivered 
every foot and ear, women of all shapes, sizes, ages, and types crowded 
the vessel, paper lanterns hung here and there with every conceivable 
color, and beyond all that was the gray sparkle of waves, the song of 
gulls, and the salty smell of air&#151;mixed, of course, with every other 
scent.

&quot;Wow!&quot; exclaimed Janna Raulson. &quot;This is really...&quot;

&quot;Loud?&quot; offered Elspeth.

&quot;Crowded?&quot; muttered Abi as an older woman shuffled past her.

&quot;Hot?&quot; said Jean with a grin. Raulson grinned.

&quot;Actually, I was about to say that this was really nice&#151;but all those 
are good answers too.&quot; For awhile they all stood there, letting the 
sights and sounds and smells affect their every sense&#151;then restlessness 
took in, and they all parted ways, each of them out to discover some 
mischief or another. Before long a throng of women were advancing on 
Janet Keys. Not wanting to be the target of flirtation, she looked 
around and found Elspeth Post staring into the distance, and headed 
toward her.

&quot;Elly,&quot; she breathed, &quot;stick with me for awhile, won&#39;t you? I don&#39;t 
wanna get picked up.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Elspeth saw the women heading towards them, grinned, and gave her 
friend and one-time love interest a catty grin. &quot;Oh, I see. Well, I 
can&#39;t blame them&#151;but all right, I&#39;ll be your bodyguard.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, I owe you.&quot; The women stared and smiled at the &quot;couple&quot;, but 
passed them by harmlessly. Janet breathed out in relief. &quot;I think I&#39;ll 
need to stay here with you for the rest of the trip. Say, you hungry? I 
could go for a snack.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m game. Let&#39;s see what they have to eat.&quot; Keys and Post linked arms 
and searched the cruise ship, but Elspeth wasn&#39;t into the pursuit. She 
still felt giddy while attached to Janet, and tried so hard to force her 
feelings away that she actually missed several obvious outdoor 
restaurants. Janet found a nice one (by smell), but even food didn&#39;t 
distract poor Miss Post. Besides, she wasn&#39;t even that hungry.

Jean-Jacques Andrews, known by many names and even more stories, was now 
confident she had died and gone to heaven. Here she was on a boat full 
of hot young (or not so young) women, many of them without a lover, most 
of them totally indifferent to long term relationships! She couldn&#39;t 
have asked for any better. She spent a few good hours wandering around 
flirting&#151;the sideshows, games, and events that were held daily didn&#39;t 
interest her&#151;and by late afternoon had already broken at least two 
hearts. Her exploration led her to an isolated part of the ship, where 
the sun was just falling down into the sky and the scenery, though 
pretty, was almost void of human life. She did find somebody, and arched 
an eyebrow as she recognized them. It was Sonia.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she sang. Sonia jumped in surprise, turned, and let out a smile 
of relief. Andrews just grinned. &quot;Sorry. Did I scare you? I didn&#39;t mean 
to break your concentration. You look bored.&quot;

&quot;Not bored,&quot; she replied, taking a deep breath and letting it out as a 
sigh. &quot;Just in deep thought, contemplative. I needed some time 
to...reevaluate some things.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Does this have anything to do with that person who broke your 
heart?&quot;

&quot;The what?&quot; Jean chuckled politely and took Sonia&#39;s hand into her own. 
It was cold and a little rough, but smelled like a scented lavender 
candle.

&quot;Don&#39;t look so surprised. Anyone can see that something&#39;s been stressing 
you out lately. Take it from me: I know heartbreak when I see it. 
Elation one day, depression the next.&quot; Sonia turned a dark, embarrassed 
color.

&quot;Was it really that obvious?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing to be that ashamed of. We all go through it. Even I, the 
great Dr. Andrews, have seen my fair share. Of course I did get over it, 
and I know a lady like you can as well.&quot;

&quot;I dunno,&quot; said Verela, smothering her face with her hands. &quot;I 
really...loved this person, with all my heart. She told me she had been 
married all this time! Married!! I just...ran out on her after she told 
me.&quot;

&quot;God,&quot; winced Jean, &quot;what a bitch. Some people can be so insensitive.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, tell me about it. How did you get over it, if I may ask?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s like the song goes,&quot; she said, stepping closer and kneading 
Sonia&#39;s hand gently. &quot;&#145;Nothing mends a broken heart like time, love, and 
tenderness&#39;. Of course, if you&#39;d like, I can easily provide for the 
other two...&quot;

......

One of the most popular attractions in the cruise ship was the bar and 
ballroom, which not only proved that patrons could get drunk, but they 
could dance too, and even combine both pleasures if they so chose. 
Plenty of teachers from Stanton gathered there, especially that first 
night, their quest similar. Elspeth and Janet took a lovelorn Sarah 
Johansson with them, volunteering to help the Swedish beauty find a 
lover or bust; Abby and Hitomi (after more private conversations) 
decided to go on a double-date with their own respective girlfriends, 
hoping to suck some civil fun out of the evening.

&quot;I appreciate your help,&quot; Sarah said to her coworkers, &quot;but I&#39;m just not 
made out for this sort of thing. I mean...I&#39;m not that good at 
socializing with strangers.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;re here,&quot; Janet told her. &quot;If I&#39;m to be the motherly 
figure everyone is making me out to be, I may as well pass on some 
&#145;parental advice&#39;. Just keep looking around until you see somebody you 
like, then go for her!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t do it,&quot; Sarah replied. Elspeth gave her a shove.

&quot;Then what, will you wait here and let them come to you?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t do that either, not with you two here. You know that nobody 
approaches a table full of women. Who knows which of them have dates and 
which don&#39;t! Of course, a lady sitting by herself is even more 
pathetic.&quot;

&quot;Oh, knock it off. We&#39;ll just leave you for awhile and say our excuse is 
we needed to use the loo.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully we can avoid being picked up in the meantime,&quot; Janet added. 
&quot;I don&#39;t know what it is about straight women that lesbians find so 
alluring.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the forbidden fruit,&quot; Elspeth grinned. &quot;They like the challenge.&quot; 
Janet rolled her eyes and went off with Elspeth, leaving poor Sarah all 
by herself. Everyone else was having so much fun, while she was left 
reeling from the loss of all her past dates. What&#39;s worse was that most 
of them had rejected her, like she wasn&#39;t good enough or she wasn&#39;t 
their &quot;type&quot;.

But I&#39;m guilty of that as well, she considered. Letting her vision stray 
lamely, Sarah noticed a rather lonesome and attractive dark-skinned 
woman hovering around the bar. Reasoning she had nothing to lose&#151;and 
taking a swig of wine for good measure&#151;she walked over to the woman and 
did her best to play the damsel in romantic distress.

Meanwhile, Janna Raulson sighed. From the way Abigail and Hitomi were 
acting, one would think they were still in love. Sure they had broken up 
just to see other people, but was that going very well? Hitomi and 
Samantha seemed more like an eccentric aunt and her niece, and Abby, 
whilst a refreshing and wonderful girl, seemed distant and wistful even 
during the most exciting moments. She still yearned for Hitomi, that 
much was certain. Perhaps the entire purpose of that break-up was to 
remind her of this fact&#151;to remind her that she loved Hitomi, fully and 
completely, and nobody could ever take her place in her heart. It 
sounded nice, but not to Janna. She had been through the emotional 
wringer enough times; lord forbid she ever come out of it in one piece.

Samantha O&#39;Brien was taking things well. She clearly had had no 
delusions of a relationship with beautiful Miss Madsen. At best she was 
a reassuring figure, a person who could care and love, but never love, 
not in the way Sammy needed. And she was young, far too young. Samantha 
craved older women for their sensual appeal, their wisdom, their 
strength and grace. She might&#39;ve gone after the Headmistress if 
everybody and their dog hadn&#39;t known that the woman was happily married.

&quot;Enjoying yourself?&quot; said Hitomi. Janna blinked and smiled.

&quot;Sort of.&quot;

&quot;You looked spaced out.&quot;

&quot;I was just thinking.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. We&#39;ve not been attentive lovers, have we Abigail?&quot;

&quot;No, my dear Hitomi,&quot; she said coyly. Oh, the double meanings! Janna 
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if she discovered the two &quot;reuniting&quot; in their 
room later on that night. But what chance did she ever have? Being with 
Abby (or for that matter, Hitomi herself) guaranteed her a short 
relationship, just as it had been with Emma and Abi before them. Sure 
the flings were nice, but what Raulson really wanted was to have 
somebody there, somebody she could wake up next to every day for years 
on end, knowing they still loved her, still wanted to be around, still 
cared.

&quot;Whew!&quot; Samantha whistled, breaking her thoughts. &quot;I never thought I&#39;d 
hear you two say that! Well! If you&#39;ll excuse me, girls, I&#39;ll be in the 
bathroom. It&#39;s a lot safer than out here!&quot; She stood and waddled off, 
merrily greeting everyone with a hello. Abby and Hitomi grinned as they 
watched her leave, then stared at each other.

&quot;She&#39;s in a good mood.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and she didn&#39;t even have any alcohol yet. Wonder what&#39;s up.&quot;

&quot;Probably this atmosphere. It&#39;s so festive!&quot;

&quot;Mm, and we haven&#39;t allowed ourselves the chance to cut loose in ages.&quot;

&quot;Too true.&quot; Hitomi turned to Janet and asked, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to bug you like 
this, Janna, but you wouldn&#39;t happen to have a cigarette on hand, would 
you?&quot;

&quot;...Get your own,&quot; she pronounced, very bitter. The Indian woman stood 
up and huffed, marching out of the room without any obstacles. Hitomi 
immediately felt a guilty weight tie her down, but was calmed by Abby.

&quot;Just let her go. I think she believes we&#39;re going to get back together 
soon.&quot;

&quot;Are we?&quot; Keeping smiled.

&quot;We&#39;ll leave that for another day.&quot;

......

Night came quickly for many, too quickly for some, and not nearly quick 
enough for others. For Abianne Cerio, the day was short and 
uneventful&#151;she had &quot;only&quot; made a pass at fifteen women! She didn&#39;t have 
any dates for that night, but found distraction enough at a light show, 
which nearly everyone attended. It wasn&#39;t quite fireworks&#151;more like 
performers manipulating beams of colored lights around in the sky&#151;but 
the day ended with fireworks, though not an impressive amount. The true 
sparks were not flying in the sky but in many rooms&#151;such as the room now 
occupied by Jean-Jacques Andrews and Sonia Verela.

Emma McGowen was having a good time, but she wanted to sort something 
out before the day was finished. She was looking for Andeira Torvald, 
who had surprised everyone by agreeing to tag along. Torvald didn&#39;t seem 
the type to board an Olivia cruise ship, but here she was, currently on 
the dance floor. Emma found her, pulled her aside to a quiet place, and 
greeted her.

&quot;So how&#39;s everything going for you, Andy?&quot;

&quot;Not too bad, not too bad. You?&quot;

&quot;Oh, the usual. It might take me awhile to get into the whole cruise-y 
atmosphere. Say, uh...listen. The reason I wanted to talk with you was 
so that we could hopefully straighten some things out between us&#151;mainly, 
our, erm, relationship and the, uh, rumors going round that you&#39;re 
leaving Stanton come this summer.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s really nothing to say,&quot; she replied. &quot;I&#39;m just leaving, that&#39;s 
all. I have too many bad memories of this place.&quot; Emma winced. She was 
perhaps the worst of those memories.

&quot;Urkk... Jeez, you must hate my guts.&quot; Sigh.

&quot;No...I don&#39;t hate you. I was just confused and overwhelmed back then. 
Me leaving has nothing to do with you. I just don&#39;t want to be here 
anymore. I really have no reason.&quot;

&quot;But Miss Marbel says you&#39;re the best linguist teacher we&#39;ve ever had. 
You&#39;ve got all the foreign languages covered except Latin, and they say 
that Sammy&#39;s gonna help you out with that. Where&#39;s she gonna go when you 
split?&quot;

&quot;Bernadette will just have to find herself another instructor,&quot; Andeira 
replied bitterly. &quot;I&#39;ve spoken to her about this, and I&#39;m not changing 
my mind. ...Sorry if I sound angry,&quot; she added under her breath; &quot;I&#39;m 
just stressed. The main reason I came here was so I could relax and get 
away from Stanton.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s all our reason. Listen, if it&#39;s really your decision, 
then...as a friend, I&#39;ll support you. Just remember that a lot of girls 
there like you and need you, and it won&#39;t be the same without you.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; Andeira&#39;s gloomy face lit up a few seconds later. She 
grinned and waved at somebody&#151;Emma turned around and noticed Sarah 
Johansson walking past them, holding hands with a gorgeous dark-skinned 
girl. Emma laughed as they passed, presumably to a more private place.

&quot;Well I&#39;ll be!&quot; she said.

DAY TWO

&quot;Good morning!&quot; exclaimed Hitomi Madsen as she reunited with her 
friends. The sun was just peeking out of the horizon, splashing the 
world with new colors. Meanwhile, Samantha O&#39;Brien was splashing 
something else with colors, making a rather loud noise of it as well. 
She was frankly hung over and about as pleasant as a porcupine.

&quot;So,&quot; said Abi, grimacing from the sight of the sickly older woman, &quot;do 
you...sleep with her?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve slept together once, why?&quot; Cerio just frowned, choosing not to 
discuss it. Too early, she reasoned. Hitomi took offense to it. &quot;For 
your information, Samantha O&#39;Brien is a wonderful person, and she&#39;s 
excellent in bed too.&quot;

&quot;If you say so,&quot; she sighed. Noticing the look in Hitomi&#39;s face, Abi 
smiled lazily and remedied, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t mean to insult you; it&#39;s just 
too early for this sort of talk. Let&#39;s wait until lunch to spread the 
gossip. Speaking of which, why don&#39;t we have breakfast together? The 
whole lot of us rarely do anything as a group.&quot;

&quot;Not hungry,&quot; said Elspeth. &quot;I&#39;m guessing those that are hungry 
are...preoccupied. Please note, Abby and Raulson aren&#39;t here. Their 
absence does befuddle the mind, does it not?&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t make me jealous, Ellie,&quot; said Madsen, coming up to tickle the 
other woman. Post laughed and swatted Hitomi away; meanwhile, a few 
other teachers came out of their caverns, some hardly looking the 
beauties they usually were.

&quot;If only we saw ourselves for what we really were more often,&quot; noted Abi 
after seeing Sarah&#39;s disheveled hair. She looked terrible. Of course, 
Emma dressed like a professional no matter where she went, and had her 
curly black hair tied up precisely even now. Janna and Abby were the 
last to join them (Jean and Sonia didn&#39;t even show up until before 
lunchtime, and when they did, miss Verela had a grin on her face the 
size of Saturn&#39;s rings), and while it did seem that they had slept 
together, they certainly didn&#39;t act like lovers.

&quot;Morning, all,&quot; said Keeping, joining her colleagues to watch the sun 
rise. &quot;Lovely day, isn&#39;t it? I hardly ever get to see the sun rise now. 
Remember when we watched the sunrise for the first time, Tomi?&quot;

&quot;I do indeed,&quot; she replied coyly, hiding her grin. The look exchanged 
between the two was borderline nauseating; Janna&#39;s ochre skin became 
gray. Going...

&quot;Remember when we watched it...from the bed?&quot;

&quot;Abby! Hush!&quot; Going...

&quot;And that special sunrise we saw on January first? I think the first 
sunrise of the New Year is so romantic...&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; Gone. Yep, that was it. She lost her. Janna dismissed 
herself without incident, knowing that she was no longer welcome. 
Unfortunately, nobody saw her leave&#151;in fact, to add insult to injury, 
Abby and Hitomi drew close and started to hold hands, completely 
oblivious to the world outside their own.

......

Breakfast was quick, healthy, and energizing, but there was little room 
for socializing. A small variety show played for the guests, featuring 
skits and stand-up suitable for early morning viewers. When the applause 
ended, the teachers parted ways again: Elspeth and Janet went back to 
the bar and ballroom for some dancing; Andeira went with them and asked 
Abi to go along, not wanting to be the object of her shipmates&#39; 
affections (they had all been flirted with enough times during the 
trip). Em McGowen, wanting to try something new, opted for the indoor 
golf course.

&quot;I feel so gay doing this,&quot; she muttered to herself. Needless to say, 
her performance was not up to par.

Once they finally emerged from their room, Sonia and Jean wandered 
around trying to find something to eat. They bumped into Janna 
Raulson&#151;&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she huffed as she passed them&#151;and wondered briefly 
why she wasn&#39;t clinging to her girlfriend.

&quot;The way she&#39;s running,&quot; Jean observed, &quot;you&#39;d think her sari was on 
fire.&quot;

&quot;Or she forgot something.&quot; They shrugged and went about their day&#151;mainly 
spending time with each other, Jean shamelessly showering her new love 
interest with attention and flirtatious actions and comments (a touch of 
her hand here, a wink there, a lick of the lips here or a brush against 
her hip there). The more time Sonia spent with the tall woman, the more 
she forgot about the debacle with the Headmistress. Dr. Andrews had that 
kind of skill&#151;she could make any woman forget about their previous 
lovers, and believe they were the most important and wonderful girl in 
the world. And Sonia had a na&iuml;ve heart.

&quot;Enjoying yourself, sexy?&quot; she asked. Sonia shivered as butterflies 
banged up against her stomach and a red glow found itself on her cheeks.

&quot;Y-yes, quite a bit. I&#39;ve never been on a cruise ship before, least of 
all one populated by women.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to the planet of the lesbians,&quot; Andrews joked. Sonia laughed, 
pure and mirthful; Andrews went in for the kill, touching the tall 
woman&#39;s face and her hair, drawing her into her stare. Sonia blushed but 
did not look away, oh no. &quot;I am glad you&#39;re feeling happy,&quot; purred 
Andrews. &quot;It&#39;s sad when a person breaks up with you, especially if they 
do it to a lovely woman like yourself. The very nerve.&quot;

&quot;Y...yes...&quot; Andrews licked her lips.

&quot;If there&#39;s anything I can do to...take your mind off that other person, 
just...let me know.&quot;

&quot;I...I shall.&quot; And then she laughed.

&quot;Come with me. I&#39;ll show you something nice.&quot; She took Sonia&#39;s hand and 
guided her gently. They could&#39;ve been going to a garbage dump; Sonia 
didn&#39;t care, as long as Jean Andrews would be there too. Dr. 
Jean-Jacques Andrews, the tall and intimidating woman who was cold and 
businesslike&#151;Sonia never imagined she&#39;d fall for her! Yet here she was, 
safe in the woman&#39;s hands, her heart light and cleansed, ready for more, 
for anything Andrews could throw her way. They ducked inside a small 
bar, found a cozy spot beneath an archway, and then, as the crude would 
say, snogged each other stupid.

Sarah Johansson was having a passionate adventure of her own. The 
insecurities she had been cloaked with earlier were gone&#151;and to prove 
it, she strolled around the ship proudly, wearing only a white A-shirt 
and shorts, nothing else. The music was hot and the March air was 
warming up to compliment it well; she soon shed her flimsy outfit, first 
removing her shirt to proudly expose her attractive chest to the whole 
world. Nearing her objective, a hot tub containing the woman she had 
picked up earlier, she wiggled out of her shorts, earning a wolf whistle 
from some distant admirer, threw her clothes in a pile, stepped inside 
the bubbling water, and made out passionately with the dark-skinned 
woman she had met not twenty hours earlier.

......

Around nightfall, Janna Raulson finally stirred up the courage to 
confront Abigail Keeping about their relationship. She looked all around 
the cruise ship, including her room and Hitomi&#39;s, and finally found the 
two holding hands along the bow, mesmerized with each other and the 
view. Right then Janna knew she had lost Abby, but what could she 
expect? Despite the fight they had been through, Hitomi and Abby were 
clearly meant for each other; their bond couldn&#39;t be snapped by anyone 
else, regardless of how much they tested its strength. It might have 
been a masochistic move, going up there and engaging her, but love had 
dug a deep hole in Raulson&#39;s heart and this seemed the only way to fill 
it.

&quot;May I speak with you two?&quot; she said meekly. The two women turned round 
and greeted Janna with a smile. She wrung her hands and lowered her 
face. &quot;It&#39;s over between us, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Um...gosh,&quot; whispered Abby, &quot;I, uh...I don&#39;t know what to say.&quot;

&quot;Just say yes,&quot; she replied glumly. &quot;It&#39;s the truth, isn&#39;t it? You two 
are going to get back together soon, I know it&#151;if you haven&#39;t already. 
Well, go on. I don&#39;t mind. It was a fun fantasy while it lasted, silly 
though it was.&quot;

&quot;Wait, Janna!&quot; Hitomi took her arm and brought her back. &quot;Listen, 
neither of us meant to get you involved in all this. Okay, so we&#39;re both 
terrible people who used you to soothe our own wounds and then broke 
your heart. We don&#39;t deserve anything but the worst&#151;but we do want to 
apologize, both of us.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no need,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I didn&#39;t expect either of you to stay 
with me. I was just...deluding myself.&quot;

&quot;Wait,&quot; murmured Abby, staring at Hitomi in disbelief. &quot;You mean...you 
and Janna?&quot;

&quot;Yes, why?&quot; Abby gawked and put her hands on her hips.

&quot;Hitomi Madsen! Honestly!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t look surprised, dear; I thought I told you.&quot;

&quot;...Oh. ...My mistake. Heh-heh.&quot; She giggled and blushed; Janna merely 
sighed.

&quot;Look, I just wanted to clear things up between the three of us. All 
this drama is giving me a headache, so if you don&#39;t mind...&quot;

&quot;Uh, actually, Janna,&quot; said Hitomi saucily. She gave Abigail a wry look 
(she knew it meant trouble), then gazed at Raulson. &quot;Janna, would you be 
interested in...a three-way?&quot;

There was an understandably awkward silence.

&quot;...What?&quot;

DAY THREE

The third day passed quickly, as days sometimes do when lots of people 
are having (perhaps) too much fun for their own good. What transpired 
between Hitomi, Abby, and Janna the night before was their business 
alone, but needless to say that it was a time enjoyed by all, no matter 
how weird it was. Raulson woke up sandwiched between the two naked 
lovelies, and when she parted ways with them there was no depression in 
her eyes nor a slouch in her step, just a smile and two clear almond 
eyes. And at least Janna showed up&#151;Hitomi and Abby didn&#39;t come out of 
their room until much, much, much later.

&quot;I&#39;m okay,&quot; she told the others during breakfast. &quot;I guess there&#39;s a 
certain peace that falls upon us all after something like this happens. 
I&#39;ll be fine, and they really do look beautiful together. I guess I&#39;m 
free to spend the rest of the cruise without a leash around my neck, or 
my eyes!&quot;

&quot;There you go, that&#39;s the spirit!&quot; sang Jean. &quot;Being single can be one 
of the most blessed times in a woman&#39;s life&#151;and on this ship, you&#39;ve got 
your pick of the litter! I bet you money there are at least...what? 
Fifteen, twenty women who&#39;d love to swing with you! That&#39;s counting me 
too, gorgeous.&quot; Janna blushed and shied away; Sonia also turned red, but 
for a completely different reason.

&quot;Well,&quot; sighed Sarah, &quot;I&#39;m not one, but for good reason. I guess I 
should introduce everyone to my new girlfriend. Ladies, this is Rita. 
Rita, these are my coworkers.&quot; The women smiled and greeted Sarah&#39;s 
girlfriend, a sultry ebony goddess some had a hard time averting their 
gaze from. &quot;We&#39;re missing two,&quot; Sarah told her new lover, taking her 
fingers into her hand. &quot;The lovebirds, I guess. Are Abby and Hitomi 
still in their rooms?&quot;

&quot;Last I saw they were,&quot; said Janna. Elspeth groaned.

&quot;They always did act like newlyweds. Why don&#39;t they just give up the 
bloody charade and get married? I&#39;m surprised they haven&#39;t yet!&quot;

&quot;Give them some time, dear,&quot; said Emma quietly, drinking her coffee. &quot;If 
what dear Miss Raulson said is correct, they just reunited after a long 
time apart from each other. They are no doubt relishing in each other&#39;s 
company.&quot; A few women blushed and opted not to say anything&#151;a few, that 
is, except for Jean Andrews.

&quot;That&#39;s a polite way of saying they&#39;re fucking each other&#39;s minds out.&quot;

&quot;Honestly, Jean,&quot; muttered Sonia, pronouncing it the American way. 
Andrews just giggled and kissed her, which she was not exactly 
enthusiastic about.

Generally the day was spent partaking in every possible activity there 
was. With the cruise and the week about halfway over, everyone wanted to 
get their money&#39;s worth, and some almost blew their minds running here 
and there, doing everything they could. The most popular sports were 
parasailing and water-skiing, but nobody was brave enough to go first. 
Samantha finally stepped up, shoving the others aside so she could 
demonstrate &quot;how a real woman does these things&quot;.

Parasailing for her was more comical; she looked like a hot air balloon 
up there. The others gave it a try and equated the rush to sex&#151;good sex, 
the kind they spoke about whenever a wave of nostalgia hit them. Others 
did not have such a view, and preferred the ground or even the waves to 
the air. Samantha was once again the first to try water-skiing, and once 
again made everyone laugh at her pale attempt (but then again, nobody 
looked cool out there, not even Dr. Andrews).

Abby and Hitomi finally showed up around late afternoon, looking every 
bit like a couple of newlyweds. Despite their extended absence in 
regards to their &quot;reunion&quot;, they both looked the professional, although 
they hardly acted like it. Soon they had convinced everyone to go 
dancing again, if only for the very last time. Nearly everyone had 
somebody to go with&#151;Sonia did not bask in the comfortable arms of her 
Jean nearly as much as she wanted to, however&#151;and even those 
unaccustomed to dancing with other women in front of a group of total 
strangers (most of whom, surprise-surprise, were gay) found themselves 
having fun.

Elspeth Post was in heaven.

&quot;This is heaven,&quot; she murmured to her partner, Janet Keys. The older 
woman smiled.

&quot;You having a good time?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been...dreaming of this moment for years.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take that as a yes.&quot; Elspeth sighed, nestling her head upon the 
older woman&#39;s shoulders. Okay, so she hadn&#39;t exactly gotten over her 
infatuation with the woman, but times had been tough for Elspeth and she 
was yearning for the presence of a lover. She was getting to the age 
where loneliness crept in the most; some would&#39;ve called it her 
biological clock going off. Looking up into Janet&#39;s kindly, pretty, 
motherly face, she could almost fool herself into believing it was meant 
to be.

&quot;Janet?&quot; she whispered, her English accent quiet.

&quot;Hmm, yeah?&quot;

&quot;I...have a confession. I&#39;m still in love with you.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; A pause. &quot;That takes some guts to say. But you know I can&#39;t return 
the feelings.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know.&quot; She squeezed the younger woman&#39;s hand. Poor Elsie!

&quot;You know that I&#39;m dating Mr. Blair, Alex&#39;s father.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;You know that...I care for him, and for Alex, and I can&#39;t abandon them 
for anybody.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.&quot;

&quot;I think...you should look for a woman your own age,&quot; she murmured. 
&quot;Somebody you can love without restraint, without negotiation.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m never going to find somebody like that, Janet.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I think you will. She&#39;ll come along when you least expect it, and 
you&#39;ll know it&#39;s her right off the bat.&quot; Elspeth sighed in defeat, 
knowing Keys was right. She couldn&#39;t do this. It just wasn&#39;t right.

&quot;I&#39;m...sorry.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; she said supportively. &quot;I&#39;ll let you dance with me tonight. 
I can do that at least. Tomorrow you&#39;ll find the woman of your dreams, I 
know it.&quot;

&quot;Here?&quot; she scoffed, &quot;On this cruise ship?&quot;

&quot;Who knows. Perhaps. Just don&#39;t give up, El, please. I&#39;m...supporting 
you.&quot; Elspeth merely grunted, not wanting to say or do anything, save 
cherish that moment, quite possibly the last happy moment she would ever 
have.

DAY FOUR

The events of the fourth day, as seen by those whose hearts have been 
broken.

I, Sonia, standing alone in my room, feel sun and sky and sweet salty 
breeze, but I do not feel Her. I, Sonia, wander alone, searching for her 
amidst a sea of skin. I must pass through the labyrinthine bodies, 
plowing my way through their midst for her touch&#151;why does my stomach 
churn so? Is it love, is it anticipation? Is it dread? I have heard the 
stories, and the rumors, but my heart believes that I could be the one 
to change them. I could be the change in her life; I could give her that 
chance to start over.

What a fool I was. What a fucking fool I was.

Now, tears in my eyes, I confront her, as I confronted my last lover, 
the one that decided to destroy me. I approached her&#151;&quot;JEAN!&quot;, I cried, 
yelling and weeping violently. &quot;You whore!&quot; I struck her hard, and spat 
at the woman she was with. I hated her so much. She told me she loved 
me! She gave me sexual pleasure! What was it all for?! Was it so she 
could have a good time, or play with another fancy plastic doll? Was 
Woman, to her, like a sock&#151;to be worn and discarded? I can&#39;t remember 
how long I cried or how long I stayed in my room, but I knew I hungered 
for many hours, deprived of a simple meal. How ironic&#151;the chef, 
starving! I starved, all right, but it was not for food. I was just a 
stupid love-starved girl, that&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever been. Nobody could love 
me. They just use me for their twisted desires and leave me in the cold.

Now I stand alone again&#151;but now, it is everywhere, like the air itself. 
Loneliness has become my air; I breathe it, in-out, in-out, and consume 
it. I am loneliness now, and depression. I think I&#39;ll go cry again.

I, Sarah Johansson, wasn&#39;t asking for much, was I? All I wanted was 
stability&#151;and a lover who would knock me off my socks! I was positive 
that I had found it when I met her&#151;and then again when I met her&#151;and 
then again, and so on, and so on, down a pathetic spiral. It&#39;s strange 
how self-destructive and masochistic we women can be. I don&#39;t care if 
you&#39;re gay or straight&#151;the things we put ourselves through are 
unbelievable! My example is most tragic: every relationship I&#39;ve been 
in, I seemed to lack the two things I most wanted. Usually, the woman 
was either steadfast and a bore, or exciting but hardly the type to 
stick around. They were just in it short-term.

Rita was like that: amazing and thrilling, but much like anything 
explosive, she was gone once the flames died and the smoke settled. I 
remember it clearly; I doomed our relationship with just one question. 
&quot;Hey, you want to be my girlfriend when we get off this thing?&quot; We were 
just finished with our...bed-business, relishing in the feel of our 
sweaty bodies melding together. I inquired, she declined. Just like that 
(well, more elaborately), she ruined my world, adding yet another mark 
to the long tally of women I had loved and lost. A few of those souls 
were even on that ship, coworkers I addressed daily! She left me in the 
morning, that Rita, saying she didn&#39;t want to be in a long-term 
relationship, like it was some nuisance or a chain. I sighed and cursed 
myself.

When I found out that Sonia had been equally inflicted, I empathized. 
Then I offered my love. No, too soon&#151;and as sweet as she was, she lacked 
the edge I needed, the sharp bang, the &quot;Wow&quot; factor that so many of my 
past failures had brought and stolen away. Only one woman came closest 
to meeting my needs, somebody who remained a friend long after we 
parted. I thought our first &quot;encounter&quot; had been made from desperation, 
like so many other encounters of our age. We must&#39;ve ended it because we 
were no longer desperate&#151;but ah, I was desperate once again. What would 
she say if she saw me crawling back to her on my hands and knees?

Only one way to find out.

&quot;Emma,&quot; I said, murmuring, &quot;can we talk?&quot;

......

Well, Janet had a point&#151;and who was I to pine after a woman I couldn&#39;t 
have? It was just plain silly (or is that the beer talking back to me?). 
So I gave up (beer). So long, Janet (beer). Been nice knowing you. Can&#39;t 
wait to get back to school (definitely the beer). Honesty is telling the 
truth, so I&#39;ll say that the result of all this drinking (to force myself 
into accepting things and letting go) was a whole hell of a lot of 
vomiting. But I composed myself, stood back up, and went out there, 
vowing to forge a new path. I made way to my friends and said &quot;Hello!&quot; 
in my finest, most proud voice, giving them a smile that was clearly 
false. I noticed an absence among us. Hitomi said that Sonia was nowhere 
to be found. Oh dear.

Sonia Verela was a good friend of mine. I have to say that we&#39;ve been 
good to each other, giving one another little gifts and gestures of 
affection&#151;such as a backrub, a smile, a polite word, some free food 
(heh-heh!), a costume for that silly party we went to (t&#39;was my field), 
or merely our presence. Nobody else was so close to her, so I 
volunteered to find her, and if need be, bring her out of her 
withdrawal. She seemed happy yesterday&#151;but then again, she had been 
moody our first day here. Cramps, perhaps?

I knew her room because she showed it to me proudly on the first day we 
arrived. I knocked at the door. &quot;Sonia?&quot; I called. &quot;It&#39;s Ellie. May I 
come in?&quot; I had to wait awhile, maybe a minute, before I was allowed 
into her world. I don&#39;t think she would&#39;ve let anyone else in.

......

Nothing else needed to be said of that day. Everyone else was simply 
sick of all the drama that had been going on, both on and off the ship, 
and so ventured to the nearest comedy club, hoping to alleviate all the 
nonsense that had gathered around them. But oh, if they only knew what 
went on behind those closed doors! Thousands of tales were being spun on 
that vessel that day, and that week; to say all of them would&#39;ve taken a 
library. But love ought not to be ignored so completely either, so 
perhaps some devotion could be brought to these tales, if only those of 
great merit.

In the case of Em McGowen and Sarah Johansson, their discourse happened 
during the trip to the comedy club, where all manner of stress could be 
alleviated with simple humor. They were both in good spirits despite the 
wrongs they had seen, committed, or had inflicted upon them. A kind of 
peace settled between the two&#151;they flirted with each other openly, 
perhaps influenced by wine&#151;but there was no alcohol needed for their 
midnight tryst, save the ambrosia of each other&#39;s tender kisses. They 
attempted to give their love a second chance, two sad souls reaching out 
for the nearest possible thing: seeking for a sliver, finding a 
treasure!

And in the case of Sonia Verela and Elspeth Post...perhaps all that 
needed to be said was that broken hearts can be mended, if they are sewn 
together correctly and forged with the flames of unlikely love. When 
Sonia fell wailing into Elspeth&#39;s arms, seeking solace in her friend, 
the words of Janet Keys came to haunt Miss Post. She would know, she 
would know, she would know her next lover when the time was right. 
Sonia&#39;s grief was practically a flare for her&#151;a sign indicating a new 
path, one that should have been tread a long time ago. All this time, 
she had been right in front of Elspeth&#39;s nose!

And that, as they say, is that.

DAY FIVE

With only two days left to enjoy their vacation, the women knew that not 
only did they need to squeeze as much fun and excitement into their 
days, but they needed to straighten out several issues first. Emma left 
her new lover briefly to give her old acquaintance Jean Andrews a piece 
of her mind&#151;and added the back of her hand for good measure. Janet, 
permanently deprived of her &quot;flirt bodyguard&quot; (and happy to hear of it), 
spent her time with Samantha O&#39;Brien instead, who was not so fortunate 
with women. The two were rarely seen by anyone, and it was assumed they 
just wanted to isolate themselves from the crowd and enjoy the few hours 
left.

Later, those without lovers gathered around to talk, complain, and think 
of their future. Andeira Torvald was still adamant about hers; leaving 
Stanton seemed to be her new passion, as if the place was diseased. 
Samantha, whenever she emerged, just listened and ate, muttering her 
opinions now and then. Abi and Janna were the most upbeat and 
enthusiastic, even though one had lost a lover earlier that week.

&quot;I&#39;m not supposed to act like a kid,&quot; Janna reasoned, &quot;unless I&#39;m 
playing a game. So screw all that love-starved nonsense. I&#39;ll just relax 
and forget about all that.&quot;

&quot;Amen!&quot; shouted Abi, raising a toast (of course, they both committed 
hypocrisy later, but the specifications of this deed went unknown and 
didn&#39;t need to be mentioned. Suffice to say, though, they both ended up 
discovering much about each other). &quot;To Janna,&quot; she said, &quot;and to all of 
you. May your state of social solidarity be fruitful and enjoyable. As 
for me, I shall continue having fun, hopefully not at the expense of 
others.&quot;

&quot;Fruitful and enjoyable?&quot; They heard a familiar voice scoff&#151;it was Jean, 
her face slightly tan from so many hours in the sun. She laughed and 
added, &quot;You&#39;re all such losers.&quot;

&quot;Oh? How so?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re sitting around moping about your relationships. If they&#39;re that 
bad, just go out and do something about it.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Janna politely, &quot;but some of us are content to stay out of 
that. I for one won&#39;t be busting my brain cells playing that game 
anymore.&quot; The others congratulated her for her ideals, but the doctor 
just snorted.

&quot;Your loss.&quot;

DAY SIX

By the final day, everyone was officially sick of each other&#151;except for 
those who had found new love on the high seas. The cruise capped off its 
events pleasantly, albeit not with much of a bang: first by serving an 
elegant breakfast and then, around noon, offering the whole crew 
scuba-diving lessons. Elspeth and Sonia were the first to jump in the 
water; Hitomi met a few dolphins while she and Abby were wading around; 
Samantha even saw a whale and took pictures that would make her the envy 
of the teacher&#39;s lounge.

At last, the ship docked and everyone was set ashore, more or less in 
better condition than they were when they set out. Abby and Hitomi had 
cemented their relationship, possibly for good, and two new pairs of 
lovebirds were born as well (most sweetly sickening were &quot;Elly&quot; and 
Sonia, but nobody wanted to begrudge the kind chef any happiness). 
Andeira, Samantha, and Janet had released many burdens from their backs, 
got a good tan, and plenty of &quot;interesting&quot; memories to share with Leena 
and Bernadette upon returning home.

As for Abi and Janna, they became close friends, but to call them 
anything else was a waste of time&#151;there was no solid proof of a deeper 
relationship (the key word, of course, being solid). As for Dr. Andrews, 
well...what could possibly be said? Except for a tan, the masculine lady 
hadn&#39;t changed a bit, which was really pathetic in terms of her 
character. As the women said farewell to the ship and the people they 
had met and known there, Emma couldn&#39;t help but pass off a snarky remark 
to Sonia, Sarah, and all those affected by the wily woman.

&quot;That one&#39;s trouble, she is,&quot; she boasted. &quot;Hell of a doc, but danger 
right out the wazoo. Better spread the word, too. We wouldn&#39;t want any 
other innocent flowers pruned by her shears.&quot; The others said they would 
do their best&#151;but eerily enough, so did Jean.</pre>
