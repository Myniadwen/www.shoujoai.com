Further In

Considering how much everyone mistrusted and generally felt animosity 
towards her, rescuing Lyn Shival from the clutches of Kali was not 
exactly high priority.  The heroes spent the better part of three days 
recovering from their ordeal in the city (along with the equally-taxing 
albeit brief battle with Mr. White), with few (if any) showing much 
passion about their next line of work.  They had to be honest:  Lyn had 
not been liked while she was living in the MERCS building, and some 
people quite despised her.  Those who felt indifferent, the majority, 
wondered why they even had to bother.  After all, Lyn had followed Kali 
of her own free will, and she probably didn&#39;t want to be rescued if that 
was the case.

Mora&#39;s &quot;noble&quot; cause was encountering more pitfalls and potholes than 
she imagined.  On the second day of respite, she herself wondered why 
she was doing this&#151;rescuing a woman she professed a hatred for, and not 
a very valuable asset to the team.  Sure, she had fought against Indira 
of the Dead Zodiac, but many others there had proved themselves beyond 
such a task.  Even Mora&#39;s friends wondered why they were going after 
Lyn, and why Miss Johsen seemed so intent on bringing the woman back 
into the fold.  Perhaps to finally prove herself, or to settle their 
rivalry?

Or was there another reason?

Alyssa considered herself the closest person to Mora in the whole 
building.  They had once been lovers, and still treated each other with 
kindness and decency, although there were plenty of awkward moments.  As 
sisters-in-arms, they had fought and bled together, in victory and 
defeat, and understood what it was like to be alone in the world.  
Hunter figured that she, more than anyone else, would be able to resolve 
this mystery, and so she made a beeline for Mora&#39;s room, asking that the 
other three residents leave them in privacy.  Mora looked like she had a 
lot of her mind, but she still let her friend in and asked her to sit.

&quot;What&#39;s on your mind, Siren?&quot;

&quot;The same thing that&#39;s on everyone&#39;s mind.&quot;

&quot;Ah.  I was expecting this.  Well, I&#39;ll tell you what I told Sal, Merry, 
and Julie:  it&#39;s something you wouldn&#39;t understand, something personal.  
I&#39;ll ask you to stay out of my affairs.&quot;

&quot;Mora, we&#39;re friends,&quot; Alyssa stated, edging closer to grasp the older 
woman&#39;s hand&#151;a bold move, considering their past.  &quot;Merry and Julie are 
newcomers to our world, and even Sally&#39;s still wet behind the ears.  
We&#39;ve gone through too much just to say that&#39;s that.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t wanna hear that from you,&quot; Mora grumbled coldly.  &quot;I know our 
past just as well as you do.  I don&#39;t owe you a thing, Siren.&quot;

&quot;Not even as a friend?&quot;

&quot;No, I saved your ass enough times in that war.&quot;

&quot;Come on, don&#39;t be like that.&quot;

&quot;And don&#39;t push me!!&quot;  Mora&#39;s sudden loudness jerked Alyssa back, making 
her recoil.  She had the look of fear as her friend&#39;s face gradually 
shifted from irritation to gray impatience.  &quot;...Don&#39;t push me, Alyssa.  
There are things I just can&#39;t tell you, not even if it helps.  I can&#39;t 
let anyone know.&quot;

&quot;Why, because you&#39;re afraid?  Or you&#39;re too stubborn?&quot;

&quot;Shut up; you don&#39;t know me.&quot;

&quot;Right, only Lyn &#145;knew&#39; you, is that it?!  Is that why you&#39;re going 
after her&#151;because you finally found someone who gave a damn about you?!&quot;

&quot;Yes, damn it!!&quot; spat Mora, who had finally snapped.  After so many 
days, so many hours trying to justify her actions, to uncover why she 
was doing this, to reason her illogical actions...it now came to a 
crash, and she burst forth like a flood.  &quot;Damn it, yes, that&#39;s why; are 
you happy?  I love that insane, selfish, stupid, bitter bitch.  I love 
her like I&#39;ve never loved anyone before.  She pushes me, she challenges 
me, and God Himself damn it, she does understand me.  Both of us could 
hold each other at night, after all our fighting and arguing, and know 
that there was someone else who could measure the degree of pain we 
know.  Ha...what a load.  I fell in love with a freak of nature who 
doesn&#39;t even know who she is, and now she&#39;s...&quot;

Mora crumbled, and Alyssa was there to catch her.  All she could do was 
hold her friend, whisper quietly to her, caress her weary shoulders, and 
comprehend what had just been revealed.  So...that was why.  Mora did 
the unthinkable, the insane, because of love.

Ten minutes later, Alyssa Hunter finally spoke.

&quot;I&#39;ll come with you.  Even if nobody else does, I&#39;ll be there.&quot;

And Mora replied, quietly and weakly.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

.........

Even though everyone was reluctant, they still went along with their 
comrade.  They had stood united before, and they were not about to let 
one of their own go off into dangerous territory by themselves, even if 
they didn&#39;t always get along with her.  Mora thanked them all as a 
group, and felt like she was really starting to belong here, amidst all 
the other freaks of nature.  For the next hour, everyone packed a few 
supplies for the road ahead and made preparations for what they felt was 
going to be their very last battle together as a team.  The only time 
they even stopped was when Marissa excused herself to speak with Dr. 
Kamaguchi.

&quot;...Do you know why I&#39;m here, doctor?&quot; asked the pale psychic.  Yohko 
looked up from a clipboard and gave her a mild smile.

&quot;I pick things up.  You&#39;re off to find Bloodbane, right?  I don&#39;t 
suppose you want me along.&quot;

&quot;The...group probably wouldn&#39;t allow it.  They trust you even less than 
they trust Lyn.&quot;

&quot;Hmph, nothing new there.  But you didn&#39;t come up here just to say that.  
What&#39;s on your mind, Marissa?&quot;  Wainright took a deep breath, folded her 
hands together, and fumbled with them nervously.  Even now, the issues 
surrounding her birth and rebirth bothered her, and she especially hated 
talking about it with the woman who was responsible for both.

&quot;...Do you know who my parents were?&quot;

&quot;Marissa, you know you weren&#39;t born like normal children.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean.  You had to get a sperm and an egg somewhere, 
doctor.  Who did you get them from?&quot;  Yohko put her studies aside, 
stood, and removed her glasses.  She looked quite the tomboy, really, 
especially since her lab coat helped conceal her petite bust.

&quot;You will not like the answer, my dear.&quot;

&quot;Please, I have to know.  You&#39;ve already told me everything else.&quot;  
Yohko sighed.  The young woman standing before her, begging and pleading 
for the truth, would be shocked if she knew.  But...she owed her this 
much, at least.

&quot;Let&#39;s just say that the bond between the two people responsible for 
your existence was...very strong.&quot;

&quot;Yohko, who...were...they?&quot;

A pause.

&quot;The egg came from me,&quot; she said at long last.  &quot;And the sperm, my 
brother.  We didn&#39;t have intercourse, naturally&#151;you know that&#151;but...yes, 
I could be considered your mother.&quot;

Another pause&#151;colder, more lonely than the first.

&quot;I thought so.  Thank you, doctor.  Uh...would you do me one more 
favor?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;...Go ahead and prepare another body.  There&#39;s a...good chance the one 
I&#39;m using now will be destroyed.&quot;

&quot;Now Marissa.&quot;  Yohko smiled warmly and placed a hand on the young 
woman&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Marissa, my dear, you&#39;re not going to try and fight 
that Kali woman all by yourself again, are you?&quot;

&quot;N-no, of course not.  But......just in case, please.  It&#39;ll give you 
something to do.&quot;  Yohko smiled sweetly, and ruffled the girl&#39;s hair.

&quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot;

......

The group was ready soon, but now a bigger problem stood before them.  
It had been about two weeks since Lyn left with Kali, and since then, 
she could&#39;ve gone anywhere.  The problem was how to find her, especially 
with such a great lead.  There wasn&#39;t another soul around for miles 
thanks to the recent war, so nobody would&#39;ve seen them coming or going, 
and any trace of their passing would&#39;ve worn away over time.  Never one 
to be intimidated by the impossible, Mora suggested rounding up a team 
of &quot;hunters&quot; to lead the group.  Among them was Butterfly with her 
massive insect spy network; Lurker and Sanaa with their sharp senses; 
Angel with her greatly-enhanced vision; Marissa and Snowblood with their 
individual psychic powers; and Thunder-Claw with his police contacts.

Now the team was set, their leaders scouting out ahead for clues of 
Lyn&#39;s passing.  Kali was reputed for leaving a trail of corpses and 
death in her wake, but except for the ruined, abandoned city, the land 
was strangely quiet.  For the moment, everyone had to rely on their 
hunters...and try to sort out issues of lesser importance along the way.  
Namie and Shalis were with the group, but said very little since the 
battle with Mr. White concluded.  They didn&#39;t expect anyone to forgive 
their betrayal, nor did they ask for it.  They just clung to each other, 
two lovers lost in their own world, walking separately from everyone 
else.  The only ones they talked to were members of &quot;the Lost&quot;, or at 
least those who bore them no great ill will (Amielle glared daggers at 
them).

&quot;Hey.&quot;  Everyone had decided to take a rest, partially because the 
hunter team was split on which direction to take.  The 
traitors-in-question noticed Merry calling out to them, and approached 
her carefully.  She crossed her arms sternly, sneering a little.  
&quot;Look...I&#39;m in no position to judge you.  I was just as desperate as you 
were, once upon a time.  I might&#39;ve given Pale away too, if it meant I&#39;d 
be rid of my anger and loneliness.  You did what you did because you 
were caught in that same curse we all were, so I can&#39;t really blame you.  
I just want you both to know that Amielle has changed a lot because of 
Pale.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve noticed,&quot; said Namie quietly.  &quot;She has improved a great deal.  
And...now that we know who and what Pale really is, I would like to 
offer an apology.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s unnecessary,&quot; Merry sighed.  &quot;The two of you were at least 
justified.  I&#39;d hate it too if I burned everything I touched, or if I 
was half-machine.  But if you want to apologize, go over and say it to 
Alicia.  I doubt Miss Celestino will listen to you.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get to it,&quot; Shalis said.  &quot;Right now, I 
have a thought I&#39;d like to share with the others.  It&#39;s not about our 
quarry, it&#39;s about the Lost Girls, and what we were promised.  Gather 
the others, will you?  Pale too; we need to speak with her.&quot;  Merry 
looked around, observing the large number of heroes lounging around, 
some conversing and some sparring to keep their skills sharp.  Was it 
really a good time for a team meeting?

&quot;...Now?&quot;

&quot;Unless our friends know where Lyn is.&quot;  Merry chewed on her lip.

&quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do.&quot;

In just a few moments, the full cast of &quot;the Lost&quot; had gathered in one 
place, with Alicia representing Pale.  Shalis detailed her thoughts 
about the promises Mr. White gave them all, and even though mentioning 
it led the others to glare at her, she went on and explained herself.

&quot;He promised us all, in general, a better life&#151;and I say he was good on 
his word, whether it was by his hand or not.  Merry is no longer under 
the influence of rage, and when she falls, she has someone there who 
clearly loves her.  Amielle, even though you lost your mother, you found 
peace of mind and someone who would understand you and care for you.  
Alisti, your mind is clear and your body is whole.  Julie, you&#39;ve 
stumbled into a whole nest of people who love you for what you are, 
especially one who loves you the deepest.  Marissa, you have discovered 
your true identity, and your purpose in this world.  And Alicia...well, 
I think you&#39;ve been given a nice gift in spite of that man&#39;s plans for 
you.

&quot;Please notice, my friends,&quot; concluded Torth, &quot;that in each of our 
cases, most of our happiness was drawn from a loved one.  Alisti has 
Skye, Amielle and Alicia have each other, Merry has Sally, Namie and I 
have each other, Julie has Kristen, and Marissa has Sanaa.  That&#39;s 
basically the whole gauntlet of my thoughts; feel free to dwell on that 
in your own time.  Oh...I want to formally apologize for betraying your 
trust in us, and especially for betraying Pale to that man.  As a 
gesture of penance, I would like to donate my own skills in the hunt.  
Being able to control computerized devices will certainly come in handy, 
if you&#39;ll have them.&quot;

&quot;Not like we have much choice,&quot; muttered Alisti.  &quot;Fine, you can help.  
The sooner we get this out of the way, the sooner...&quot;  She trailed off 
slowly, and suddenly turned into a very depressed young woman, so much 
so that it even garnered Amielle&#39;s concern.

&quot;...Hey, you okay, Alisti?  You look like your dog just died.&quot;

&quot;...Nothing,&quot; whispered the girl, her voice frighteningly faint.  &quot;Let&#39;s 
just continue our search, and get it over with.&quot;  No arguments were 
made, and once a path was decided on, the group resumed their trek.

But they were not alone.

&quot;What do you hope to gain from this, doctor?&quot; whispered Pandora 
drearily.  Crouched in a safe spot several dozen paces behind the 
others, Kamaguchi and Soma had secretly and carefully followed the 
heroes in spite of everything.  Soma went along, as usual, but this time 
she had doubts, which she voiced as quietly as she could.  &quot;I mean, 
don&#39;t you have enough specimens?  Getting them from the Savage Six and 
all those other powered beings should&#39;ve been enough.  I&#39;d say you&#39;re 
about ready to burst.&quot;

&quot;I know what I&#39;m doing, Soma,&quot; Yohko hissed.  &quot;It&#39;s not Kathlyn Shival 
I&#39;m after anyway, it&#39;s that woman she went with.&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh...Kali, was it?  Why, you think she has special powers?&quot;  Yohko 
nodded.

&quot;Remember, it took several of them just to hold her off.  Marissa 
herself perished in an earlier fight&#151;she gave Kali everything she had, 
and still the woman&#39;s alive.  I&#39;ve never encountered a stronger subject, 
not even among the Savage Six.  If I can somehow channel that strength 
into my project...&quot;  She trailed off eerily; Pandora noticed that her 
friend&#39;s face was drawing a smile of total, insane glee, like a child 
would if they were told they were now the proud owner of a candy store.  
Soma liked Yohko&#151;no, in truth, she loved her&#151;but the look on her face 
was unsettling.  She shuddered, and wondered if the good doctor knew 
what she was getting into.

.........

Two weeks into their lonely journey, and Kathlyn Shival was seriously 
starting to wonder if the bond Kali claimed was between them was really 
true.  She had never felt like anyone&#39;s sister, or even a member of 
anyone&#39;s family&#151;just a lonely, isolated woman, turned bitter and jaded 
because of it.  When those monks found her in that jungle, she was a 
baby, with no memories or history to call her own.  They first called 
her Kathlyn, after a Saint, and Shival, after the jungle&#151;but when she 
was three years old, they dubbed her &quot;Solaris&quot;, after the rare species 
of plant.  This flower&#39;s inner fluids could harden in a matter of 
seconds, much like Kathlyn&#39;s blood.  For the longest time, she believed 
she was the result of a plant-human hybrid, whether born or created, but 
now...

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Lyn said as Kali approached her, looking curious.  &quot;I was just 
thinking.  I&#39;m starting to have doubts about myself.  Earlier, I thought 
my personal history was set, and I was the result of mad science or a 
freakish deity&#39;s joke.  But then you came along, and I began to wonder 
if I really was your sister.  It made sense at the time&#151;after all, this 
Dark Scion person could&#39;ve made me as well as you, and...I&#39;ve always 
wanted a family.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have any doubts,&quot; Kali spoke tenderly.  She took Lyn&#39;s hand and 
squeezed it affectionately.  &quot;There can be no argument.  We are of the 
same make and model.&quot;

&quot;Is that so...&quot;  Lyn drew away, and looked off into the distance, 
wondering what their destination was.  Kali was taking her somewhere, 
but where?  &quot;So just where are we going, anyway?  You plan on parading 
with me across the whole planet?&quot;

&quot;No, I know where we&#39;re headed.  I can feel it in my bones.  It&#39;s a 
sacred place on this very planet, a source of the world&#39;s own energy.  
The name for it is a Mana Leyline, a nexus that channels the soul of the 
world into the living air.  There are very few of them in the known 
universe; my memories indicate that I have seen two.  One was in a vast 
desert, guarded by triangular tombs; the other was nestled deep in a 
forest where fairies lived.  The one we&#39;re aiming for is not far off.  
Can you feel it?&quot;  Lyn closed her eyes in silence and concentrated, but 
the only thing she could feel was her clothes.

&quot;No, I can feel nothing.&quot;  Kali smiled warmly and encompassed her hand 
again.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;ll come to you.  Give it time.  Are you ready?&quot;

&quot;...Yes.  Let&#39;s go.&quot;

The great wilderness broke amidst tall grasslands and marshes.  
Mountains began to form, their chilly air falling down to inflict the 
valleys with refreshing breezes.  The day brightened; Lyn removed some 
of her clothes, and fanned herself in the increasing heat.  The sun bore 
down; green roads of lush fern and bush waved as a sea of flora in the 
wake of the two women.  Waters formed as rivers; a great rainbow of fish 
flew down the stream, some caught as the women scooped or speared them.  
Days turned pale, dark and gloomy; the sky became littered with lights, 
a few of which Kali recognized.  She felt she could spy the world she 
was first born on, distant though it was; Lyn retreated into a 
melancholy sleep, feeling she belonged on no world, not even this one.  
Kali came to her and comforted her through the cold evening.

Upon dawn&#39;s first stretch into day, the ladies left their first 
impressions on the populace together, demonstrating to each other the 
skills they held in battle.  A large organization of desperate 
criminals, some left over from the three-day war, surrounded them and 
demanded their possessions and bodies.  Their challenge was met and 
overcome; not a single survivor remained to spread the tale of the two 
goddesses of death, one fair and the other silvery.  Upon victory, Kali 
turned toward her companion and remarked how much greater now was her 
skill&#151;yet another reason to believe they were as family.

The end of two and a half weeks led them to their destination, a place 
that could not be mistaken as anything but magical.  A great fountain, 
circular and massive, straddled the midst of the grassland, flanked by 
ruinous architecture that suggested a more ancient civilization.  The 
fountain&#39;s very spire rose high, nearly tickling the sky with its watery 
zenith; the falls it produced were as mighty and strong as any natural 
ones.  Lilies, narcisses, fresh hanging ivies, and even Solaris flowers 
decorated the fountain; the pool itself was larger than most houses, and 
deep as a small giant, so that the two women could enter into it and 
bathe at leisure.

&quot;We&#39;ve arrived,&quot; said Kali, allowing a moment for them both to 
appreciate this beautiful sight.  &quot;This the Mana Leyline I spoke of.  
Can you feel the aura of the world&#39;s soul flowing out from it?&quot;

&quot;I certainly can,&quot; whispered Lyn breathlessly.  Even a skeptic could not 
avert their gaze from the spiritual aura of this place; it was as if the 
footstep of the Creator had carved a niche just for this fountain.  
Carefully, as if the slightest move would upset this balance, Kali 
ceremoniously removed her clothes, catching her companion off guard.

&quot;Come.  We must purify ourselves first before the ceremony of bonding 
can begin.  We must have a baptismal of water and flesh before we can 
have one of spirit.&quot;  Lyn didn&#39;t know what she was talking about, but 
she went along with it, disrobing down to her bare skin.  Kali&#39;s body 
was breathtaking:  strong, tall, and muscular, but clearly soft and 
feminine to the touch, one would not accuse this woman of any evil.  
Nervously, Lyn dipped her feet into the pool; Kali took her hand, smiled 
warmly, and together they entered the waters.

They separated to douse their bodies with the water.  Two weeks&#39; worth 
of traveling&#151;dust, brambles, thorns, a few bruises here and there&#151;melted 
off in the cool, clear water, and soon Lyn&#39;s body was renewed.  Her 
long, silvery hair matted against her skin, so she held it back as best 
she could.  Kali erupted from the water, creating a splash as her skin 
emerged, clean and pure once more.  Lyn couldn&#39;t help but stare at her 
companion, beautiful and deadly, and slowly waded over to her, seeing 
the look of need in Kali&#39;s eyes.  They came within reaching distance; 
Lyn lowered her head shyly, her nakedness now ten times more apparent.  
Kali lifted her chin with her dripping fingers, and smiled with love 
before placing a tender kiss on Lyn&#39;s trembling lips.

The two slowly melded, merged, and fused together in a baptism of flesh 
and water.

......

With their sexual congress concluded, the two women calmly came to shore 
and dressed once again, finding their clothes itchy and worn-out.  For 
the time being, the humble garments would have to suffice:  they didn&#39;t 
want to complete the ritual of bonding naked, after all.  Lyn&#39;s mind 
continued to spiral downward into conflict, and her doubts increased by 
the minute.  Kali had been good to her so far, but...what if this ritual 
failed?  What if it didn&#39;t work, and she discovered Lyn wasn&#39;t her 
sister?  Would she hate her?  Would she kill her?  Or...would it work 
after all, and all of Lyn&#39;s wishes came true after that&#151;but then what?  
What did this woman hope to achieve?

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; asked she, extending her hand.  Lyn nodded timidly and 
took it.  She had came this far, so for better or for worse, she would 
see it through to the end.  Carefully, the two waded their way through 
the waters again, drenching their clothes in the crystalline water.  
They began to ascend the spire, that zenith from which the water flowed, 
presumably to the top where the ritual would take place.  But no sooner 
had Lyn began her ascent did a voice cry out, one she thought would 
never haunt her ears again.

&quot;WAIT!!  Hold it!  Stop!!&quot;

It was Mora Johsen, the Cobra, that miserable creature Lyn hated, yet at 
the same time, understood and even loved to a degree.  She halted as 
requested, turned to ascertain the truth, and revealed her greatest 
scowl.  Not only Lyn, but the whole gang was here.  Kali leaped down 
from the spire, Lyn coming after her, and grinned maliciously at those 
who had come to witness this event.

&quot;You&#39;re too late.  There will be no stopping our bonding ritual.  Once 
my sister and I fuse our bodies together in perfect harmony, the world 
will be under our thumb.  We will bring about an age of order and reason 
again, where death shall cleanse and where life shall renew again.  This 
woman is mine.  You have no hope of stopping us.&quot;

Mora Johsen smiled.  She loved it when people said something was 
impossible.

&quot;We&#39;ll see about that.&quot;

To be continued...

Epilogue

[...] And I saw a beast coming out of the sea.  He had ten horns and 
seven heads, with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head a 
blasphemous name.  [...] The dragon gave the beast his power and his 
throne and great authority.  One of the heads of the beast seemed to 
have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed.  The whole 
world was astonished and followed the beast. &#150;Revelations 13: 1-4
