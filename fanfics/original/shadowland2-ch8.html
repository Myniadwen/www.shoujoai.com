<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Alyson frantically dug through her duffle bag in search of a long sleeved shirt, ever since Kris mentioned the marks on her arms she felt even more exposed then usual. Finally she came across a tight black long sleeved shirt and quickly stripped off her t-shirt before pulling the new top over her head. It clung snugly to her body revealing her thin frame. She starred at herself in the mirror for a moment smoothing out the wrinkles in her clothes. Her breasts were barely visible against the black fabric and yet there was a comfort in the tightness of the clothes. She grabbed her katana off the hook on the back of the door and rushed out into the hall. 

She found herself needing to snake her way through the tide of girls which were cramped and crowded, and she want to get out into the open air as she searched for some way out. Several girls greeted Alyson as she pushed on through the crowd, however she ignored the greetings. She had only one destination in mind and ignored all around her till she found a back entrance at the far end of one of the halls, burst out of the dorm into a small field and took a deep breath of the cool air. She could hear the chatter of girls on the patio to her left, her ears picking out Natalie&#39;s laughter from the crowd and she turn to see the girl sitting amongst her friend smiling and talking. She watched the girl carefully as Natalie proceeded to tuck a lock of her hair over her ear before taking a bite of eggs. A pang of pain stabbed at Alyson&#39;s heart and she forced herself to turn away from the group, trudging across the field until she came to a tree. She leaned her sword against the side of the tree, then flopped upon the ground and stared up at the leaves as they played with the breeze, her eyes felling upon an apple hanging off one of the branches causing a frown crossed her face. 

(Don&#39;t you love me?) 

Alyson could hear Natalie&#39;s words from yesterday still ringing in her ears, haunting her very existence. How could such a simple question hurt so much? She closed her eyes against the question, still not sure how to answer it. If it were as easy as saying &#39;yes&#39; then Alyson would have done so right then and there. She rolled onto her stomach and glanced over at the girls on the patio. If she only had the strength to speak what was in her heart. If only fear would not continue to torment her mind. 

She sat up and leaned against the tree. Near the front of the dorm Alyson watched a small group of girls giggling amongst themselves. How she wished she could be part of the crowd, she had always been the outcast since her earliest memories. She stared down at her hands and studied her long thin fingers, rough hand that had grown tough from years of sword training, never having time for girlie things. Drake was always demanding her to practise more and grow stronger. She never left home without a blade in hand, she was even the one who demanded Natalie never go out without that arm blade on her and as such no one wanted to befriend a freak like herself. 

Her eyes drifted to her sword, it&#39;s sheath made of the finest of obsidian, a Celtic design in gold leaf adorning its surface and a gold catch near the hilt.  She picked up the weapon, enjoying the way the black silk ribbon wrapped handle felt in the palm of her hand. She unsheathed the blade, watching as the sun gleamed across its silver finish. Within it&#39;s reflective surface Alyson could see her own sad eyes staring back out at her, deep set eyes with long lashes and a misery so profoundly set that no matter of love would free her from its agony. She set the broad side of the sword against her forehead and let out a sigh, &quot;She could never really love me.&quot; She muttered to herself half-heartedly. 

&quot;Alyson?&quot; Someone called out softly. 

Alyson opened her eyes and looked up to see Nicole cautiously walking towards her with nervousness in her stance, &quot;Morning, Nicole.&quot; Alyson greeted with a weak smile, &quot;Did you just arrive at school?&quot;

Natalie nodded energetically, the sight of Alyson&#39;s smile seemed to cheered up the child as she sped up her pace and sat down beside Alyson, &quot;I didn&#39;t seen you around after class. I was getting worried.&quot; Nicole said wearily, &quot;Is it true that you are staying at the dorms now?&quot; She asked with a look of intrigue upon her round face. 

Alyson nodded slowly, &quot;Yeah, I have to watch over that sister of yours after all, right?&quot; She half joked with a slight smile.

Nicole&#39;s face brightened, &quot;Really? That is great!!&quot; She leaned on her hands, &quot;I wish I could stay at here too.&quot; 

&quot;Maybe one day you will.&quot; Alyson noticed a pendent swinging around the girl&#39;s neck, the gift she had given Natalie to protect her from evil.

&quot;Not likely,&quot; Nicole remarked dismally, &quot;Does that mean that you and Nat are back together again?&quot; She asked, changing the subject. 

Alyson frowned, &quot;No...&quot; Her eyes did not leave the pendent, &quot;So that is where it ended up.&quot; She reached out to touch it when Nicole cringed and clenched onto the necklace. Alyson glanced up at the girl&#39;s face to see fear in her eyes; &quot;I&#39;m not going to take it from you.&quot; She assured brushing the girl&#39;s bangs out of her eyes. &quot;Natalie gave it to you, so it is now yours.&quot; Alyson explained, although the thought of Natalie giving her gift away so easily hurt. 

Alyson turned away to see Natalie leaving the dorm with Jenn, &quot;Well, speaking of your sister...&quot; She watched the two girls cross the lawn on their way to the nurse&#39;s office behind the school, &quot;Come back to me...&quot; Alyson mumbled sadly under her breath hoping that the girl would hear her prayers. Almost as if Natalie could hear the girl&#39;s plea she turned to face them. Natalie stared in her direction for a time. It almost seemed as if she would in fact head towards Alyson. However, after a word with Jenn they both turned and disappeared around the building out of view. Alyson rolled to her side and curled up into a ball, &quot;Please come back to me...&quot; She repeated with her face buried in her sleeve.
