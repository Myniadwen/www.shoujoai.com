text-indent:.5in'>To tell you the truth, I don’t really know how to start
things off, as this is the first time I ever wrote a diary. I didn’t even know
what one was until a couple of weeks ago, when I found my housemate sitting in
her room, writing neat characters in an elegant, flowing hand upon the pages of
a small book under the flickering candlelight. When I gave her hair, tied at the
nape of her neck by a snowy ribbon, a tug and asked her what she was doing, she
had given such a violent start that her flailing arms nearly knocked over the
table in front. It turned out that she never realized me standing behind her
back, looking over her shoulder.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, you’d probably think that it’s nothing out of the
blue, wouldn’t you? What’s unusual about a girl being startled? But you know ne,
it’s my housemate we’re talking about, and saying that she’s <i>just</i> a girl
is the furthest thing from the truth. Her senses are so acute that no one – I
mean <i>no one, </i>seriously! – had been able to get within twenty feet of her
without being noticed. I should know, as my attempts to sneak up on her had
always ended in failures. That probably explains why it had been so fun looking
down at her that night, watching the panic in her obsidian eyes and listening
to the unevenness of her breaths. In fact, it was so amusing that I actually rolled
on the floor laughing and thumping my fist on the tatami mat. I couldn’t stop
until my side ached. Meanwhile, my companion never said a thing as she fixed me
with an intimidating look, most likely trying to quiet me down. She gave up a
while later, when she dropped her serious expression and began to laugh softly
into her hand. Nikki-chan, you probably can’t imagine how cute she looked doing
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>After our mirth had been suppressed, she explained to me that
she was writing a diary, which I noticed was lying upon her laps, beneath her
folded hands, its content safely away from my prying eyes. She said that a
diary was something in which she recorded what had happened during the day,
both good things and bad. She believed that putting her thoughts into words,
onto the paper would help clear the heavy thoughts that clouded her mind. When
I asked her why I never saw her doing that before, she said that it was because
she only wrote things in her diary when she was alone in her room. Amused, I
asked jokingly if she had some kind of secrets she was hiding from me, fully expecting
her to shake her head frantically and assure me there was nothing like that. Surprisingly,
she only gave me an odd look and kept silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Puzzled, I nagged her and tugged at her sleeves – trying to
get an answer, of course – for the next hour or so but didn’t get anywhere. The
only thing she said to me in the end was that she was going to take a bath and
that I should go back to my room. She wasn’t quite amused when I offered to
scrub her back, though. Well, I knew I wasn’t supposed to but….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Anyways… I digressed. How silly of me, ne, Nikki-chan. Sorry.
The point I’m trying to make is that I’m still new at this, that’s all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, the weather today is totally better than usual. Um,
well, it’s still as cool as ever. I’m in Hokkaido after all, and you know how
low the temperature here can drop. At least the clouds are nowhere to be seen,
leaving a deep azure stretching across the heavens. The sun’s out, casting its
golden shine upon the ground of <i>Furisame Jinja.</i> I wish it could warm the
air around me up a little bit, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Right now I’m sitting on the verandah around the residential
area of the shrine, in a warm coat, legs dangling over the edge, with you
propped on my laps, a brush clutched in my hand, and an ink tray on the wooden
floor, within my arm’s reach. Nikki-chan, I probably should put you on the
table in my room, as my handwriting would be a little bit more legible that
way, but I figure that staying outdoor is much healthier for both of us, don’t
you agree?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Let me give you more details about my place, ne, Nikki-chan.
We’re in <i>Furisame Jinja</i>, <i>the Shrine of the Falling Rain</i>, which
was dedicated to Susanou no Mikoto, the God of Storms. I asked my housemate
once why the people chose to worship him out of all deities in the Plains of Heaven.
The answer I got was kinda unexpected.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“<i>Practical reason, no more, no less,</i>” my housemate said
wryly. “<i>They picked Susanou no Mikoto because he is the one who twiddles
their chance of survival around his fingers. You would understand, many people
in this neighborhood are farmers living solely on the profit their rice fields
yield each season. As such, they have good cause to be fearful of storms, which
can destroy their crops. Think about it that way, and you can see clearly why
they try so hard to appease Susanou, hoping to earn his good graces.</i>”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I know I shouldn’t be telling you this, Nikki-chan, but I
think out of all the people in our little town, my housemate’s the only one the
deity failed to impress. Isn’t it ironic that the Chief Priestess of Susanou no
Mikoto’s Shrine regards him barely higher than a mere mortal?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>In any event, our Shrine is pretty new, about half a dozen
years old, just like others around this northern island. My housemate explained
that the Meiji government was – still is, she added – using Shinto to unify the
hearts of its citizens. No wonder why the Emperor introduces the state religion
to Hokkaido, at the faraway edge of his empire. <i>Furisame</i>, located at the
foothill of Asahi Mountain, was among the first to be built in that effort.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Well, whatever the purpose of this Shrine’s existence is,
it’s still a nice place to live in, especially when the person in the room next
to mine is a young Priestess who smiles fondly at me whenever our eyes meet. In
her company, I doubt I can find sadness or boredom any place near where we live.
In fact, I can gush about her all day, telling you about her good points but
I’m rather afraid it would fill all your pages without being able to finish.
Yes, she’s <i>that</i> wonderful. I don’t think I can find anyone like her even
if I travel to the end of the world. She’s kind, she’s caring, she’s gentle,
and she’s the prettiest girl I’ve met. She’s…. Sorry, I’m doing that again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>You know ne, Nikki-chan; I think <i>Furisame Jinja</i> is the
most beautiful shrine on Earth. Unfortunately, my lovely companion didn’t share
the same opinion, for she tried to point out to me once that our cozy and
humble abode was much smaller and far inferior to <i>Ise Daijin-guu</i> or <i>Izumo
Taisha</i> in both artistic sense and prominence. She asked me once why I insisted
that even if the places she listed were a hundred times prettier, they would
still be no match for <i>Furisame Jinja</i>. I answered that it was because <i>she</i>
didn’t live in the <i>Grand Shrine of Ise</i>, or the<i> Great Palace of Izumo</i>.
She blushed bright red and changed the topic.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Dear Nikki-chan, the reason why I’m writing right now is
because I was terribly lonely. I couldn’t help but feel that way when I'm all by
myself in this spacious <i>Shrine of the Falling Rain</i>. No, there is no one
else except me here. I didn’t expect that I would be in this situation, to be
honest. If anything, I only thought that I could take advantage of this day to have
fun with my lovely companion. You know what; I even spent the better part of
last night planning ways to make her show once more the beautiful whole-hearted
laughter I so dearly cherish.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>With that said, you probably could tell how devastated I was
when I woke up to her voice this morning, being told that she had urgent
business in a town on the other side of the island so she had to leave in a
minute. My heart sank upon realizing that she was already in traveling clothes,
her luggage laid at her feet. My whole self ached as I followed her to the Main
Gate of <i>the Shrine of the Falling Rain</i>. My eye stung watching her treading
upon the road leading to the small town this Shrine’s supposed to protect. My
face was soaked with tears even before her slender figure faded completely into
the distance. Only then did I realize that I had been too shocked to realize
that she never once asked me to come with her, or gave me any idea of when she
would return. I didn’t stop crying in my room until a few hours ago, when fatigue
defeated me and put me to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>To sum it all up, the young Priestess’s departure is the
cause of my loneliness and misery. Without her presence nearby, I can hardly
find anything that lifts my spirit. Without her voice, the deafening silence
seems to solidify into something that weighs down on my shoulders. Without her
beautiful face, everything in my eyes becomes dull. Even my favorite <i>odango</i>
snack tastes like dust in my mouth. Even the melodious chirping of the birds
around the <i>Jinja, </i>which I love listening to every moment awake, is now
but an off-key note in the rhythm of life. Even the leaves, coated with the morning
dew, have stopped being shiny. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Dear Nikki-chan, I just remember that there are a few things
that require my immediate attention, so I’ll stop. Since my friend the
Priestess left in such a hurry, she didn’t have time to prepare anything for my
lunch or dinner, which means that I must do the cooking myself. By the way,
I’ve noticed some cobwebs hanging at the corners of our rooms and the Hall of
Offerings, so I guess I’ll clean up the Shrine, too. I hope I’ll be too tired
to think of her when I’m done with all these chores. Hopefully, I won’t have to
cry myself to sleep….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I’ve just realized that although I’d been bothering you for
hours on end yesterday, I never introduced myself. How very rude of me, ne. My
current name’s Amano Hikari. Current… because it’s not what my mom and dad gave
me when I was born into this world. To tell you the truth, none of what I own
right now belongs to me. Certainly not the clothes on my body, my name, my
face, or even my past. You see, Nikki-chan, all I’m living is a lie. Worse, if my
housemate the Priestess learned of the secret I’ve been keeping, she’d probably
drive her sacred sword into my heart despite what we shared during the time I
lived with her. Should I choose to run away from her – small chance I could –<i>
someone else</i> would make me wish I had died at her hand. How did I get
myself into such a mess? Well, it’s a long story, but I’ll tell you all about
it, Nikki-chan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Despite my appearance, as much mine as the identity I’m assuming,
I’m not human. Are you guessing that I’m a demon? No, silly. How can a demon
get inside a Shrine and live together with a Priestess? I think there’s a word with
which humans call my kind… what is it I wonder? It’s on the tip of my tongue,
so wait for me a second…. Ah, a half-breed. Yup, a half-breed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As the name tells you, I’m the product of the love between a
human and a demon. You know ne, Nikki-chan, my dad is a nine-tail <i>kitsune
youkai</i>, a fox demon, who had lived for hundreds of years and accumulated
powers beyond belief. Unlike his people, he never despised or looked down upon
the ‘<i>pitiful’</i> humans whose lives were at best ephemeral. What my dad harbored
towards them were pity… and love. He even lived among them so he could silently
protect them from the other demons who wreaked havocs across the land. I don’t
think there’s a demon who has as much sense and honor as him in the darker side
of the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>My mom, on the other hand, was a human. Not just any normal
human, she’s a Priestess who once served in the <i>Grand Shrine of Ise </i>itself!
Well, the most incredible thing about her wasn’t her power or her rank at the <i>Grand
Shrine</i>, but her attitude toward demons in general. She, heavens and earth
apart from her colleagues, was fed up with seeing demons and humans trying to push
each other toward the edge of extinction. Brought up as a guardian of
humankind, she had been taught that the demon race must be wiped off the face
of the Earth. She was sickened to the core by the teachings. It wasn’t long
until she resigned from <i>Ise</i> and decided that she wanted a quiet life on
this faraway island, where demons and humans alike could pester her least. It
was fate, because Hokkaido was the birthplace of my dad. It was here that my
parents met one another, fell in love, and gave birth to me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>My childhood was filled with bliss. Both my mom and dad doted
on me and spoiled me rotten the way they gave me everything I wanted. Of course
I have a demon form, as you’d expect, but I would never transform unless I
choose to. That was how I had the luxury of living a human’s life without the
fear of being detected. I could even play with the neighbors’ kids as long as
either my mom or dad was there to keep an eye on us. I had spent the first sixteen
years of my life thinking that I was the happiest and luckiest child in the
world. I never imagined that one day, all hell would break loose.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I suppose that the Immortals of Heaven either envied my mom
and dad’s relationship or were just cruel in general. I see no other reason why
calamity would descend upon the roof of the most respectable family in this
island. It all began with my dad’s protectiveness over his human villagers, who
of course were still kept in the dark about his true identity as a demon. You
see, Nikki-chan, my dad prevented the other demons of this island from harming
the villagers, driving them away every time there was a raid. One problem, my dad
refused to kill his own kind, so in the end, what he essentially did was sowing
enemies all over the place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>On my very sixteenth birthday, the demons decided that they
had had enough. A horde of them converged upon the sky of our house and sent dad
an ultimatum, declaring that he would either fight them to preserve this
village or watch everyone in it die. My dad, being the righteous and merciful
person he was, picked the first choice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When he came back two hours later, he was a bloody mass of
torn flesh. My mom and I felt our heart convulsing in pain as we watched him emerge
from the barrier that kept whatever going on within invisible. Both of us burst
into tears seeing him collapse on our doorstep. It had been a brutal fight,
with my dad outnumbered a hundred to one. Thanks to his transcending power, he
managed to kill them all – he couldn’t afford letting them live this time, Nikki-chan,
so don’t think badly of him, ne – but not before he himself sustained grievous injuries.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>We tried to help my dad, yet our efforts turned out to be in
vain. We stopped the blood but we could do nothing to replenish the power he exerted
during the battle. Nikki-chan, my dad was a full-blooded demon, whose human
form was directly linked to his power. Without the latter, the former couldn’t
exist. We realized that we were in deep trouble when my dad’s body started to
glow so intensely it plunged the whole village in which we lived into a sea of
white light.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When the villagers rushed to our house, where the light
originated, what they found wasn’t the gentleman who had set such a perfect
example for everyone else to follow. What they saw lying on his bed was a fox
twice as large as a man, whose fur was white as driven snow, whose nine tails
were as long as his body. It didn’t take them much time to realize that the <i>kitsune
youkai</i>’s fur was of the same color as my dad’s hair. Even the dumbest
person could figure out the rest. When my mom and I noticed that their faces
were darkening with anger, some with fear, some with disgust, we knew something
bad was going to happen. When we saw them running back to their houses, we knew
we had to get my dad away.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, you can’t imagine how panicked my mom and I were
at that time. We were aware that the villagers, those who had guts anyway, were
fetching pitchforks and plows so they could come back later and kill my dad.
Yet, there was nothing we could do. Having reverted into his true form and
being covered with bleeding wounds only made the situation worse. He was too
heavy for us to carry him to safety, and had too little of his powers left to
teleport all three of us away. It didn’t help, either, that we refused to leave
him to mercy of the mob of villagers who would arrive in any minute. In the
end, my parents came to a conclusion. Blessed with a good memory as I am, I
still can remember every word they said on that fateful day.</p>

to my mom after a sigh, his voice barely audible. After every few words, he
would cough a cough that tore at my heartstrings.</p>

the wardrobe. In no time at all, she pulled out some of my clothes and put them
in a large piece of cloth, which she tied up in the end into a large bundle.
“Here you go, child.” She put the thing in my arms.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“My stubborn daughter,” he sighed, “I’m sorry, but you don’t
have a choice.” A magic circle appeared beneath my feet at the end of his
sentence, which trapped me inside a pillar of white light. I knew what he was

longer see either my mom or dad. Yet, I could hear the sound of people shouting
getting louder and nearer. It was the villagers. And they were screaming for
death and blood.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, I found myself on a forested hill behind our
village after that, watching a column of pure white flame charging at the
afternoon sky. No human could have created it. I think you could figure out
what it meant, don’t you? Yeah, my dad had invoked the final bits of his powers
to weave a spell that would render both him and my mom to dust. They didn’t
want to die in the hands of the people they used to love, the people they had
spent years protecting from the shadows… so they took their own lives. Nikki-chan,
I spent the rest of the day on that same hill, crying my eyes out even after
the column of flame had dissipated. When I sneaked back into town at midnight,
all I found was a blackened ground where my house used to be… and a drawn
picture of me everywhere else. The villagers meant to see me dead. The first
thing I did after seeing that was running as if hell was on my heels.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>From that day onward I lead a life where I didn’t know
whether I could live to see the next sunrise. I wandered from villages to villages,
earning money from whatever jobs I found so I could ease my almost always empty
stomach. I rarely stayed in one place for too long because the fear in my heart
always urged me to leave before people recognized who I was. I couldn’t take
chances. Who knew when a wanted picture of me would arrive from the village I
grew up? Who knew when the villagers around would try their best to kill me
because I’m a half-breed?</p>

clothes, the sun was shining just like it did the day I first talked to you so
I thought to myself that by the end of the day, the laundry would be all dried.
Boy, how wrong I was. After I hung everything over the clotheslines, I decided
that I’d like a little nap. Washing clothes was hard work, you know, especially
when I spent a lot of time on each piece of clothing of my friend the
Priestess. Not that they were very dirty, though; my housemate’s one of the
cleanliest persons I ever met. Somehow, I felt sorta happy knowing that I for
once was doing something for the one I cherished so I kinda lost in the sensation,
that’s all.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>You must be thinking that I’m a lazy girl, don’t you, Nikki-chan?
Um, I admit that I am one, but the reason why I haven’t been helping much with
the chores had nothing to do with that. I’m telling the truth, honest! My
housemate likes to do everything herself. She doesn’t let me cook. She doesn’t
let me clean the floor. She doesn’t even let me wash my own dishes!</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Um, I’m rambling, aren’t I? Sorry, Nikki-chan. As I was
saying, I took a nap once I was done with hanging the laundry on the clotheslines.
I don’t think I had slept for more than half an hour when a loud, rumbling
noise woke me up. I was horrified upon realizing that it was raining cats and
dogs outside. Everything was sodden as a result. I’ll wash them again when it
stops raining. The load isn’t that much anyway, especially when I plan to take
care of only my friend’s clothes. Mine? I’ll just dry them off. Yeah, yeah, I’m
lazy, I know.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>The new chapter of my life started somewhere in the middle of
the sixth month of last year. To tell you the truth, I was on the run from an
exorcist – a monk – who arrived at my last dwelling, a village that was quite
far away. Call me a coward all you want, Nikki-chan, and I’ll agree with you
whole-heartedly. I’m aware that my human blood completely dominates my other
one, therefore erasing any and all demonic behaviors other half-breeds may
have. I don’t even exude the evil aura that my kind does, so unless an
extremely powerful exorcism ritual was performed on my body, none would know
I’m not entirely human. In other words, the exorcist couldn’t possibly find out
about me. Yet, the fear never stopped putting me on edge. I could barely keep
myself from trembling every time I saw the monk passing by the takoyaki shop I
was working in. I never had the courage to look him in the eye or wish him a
good day when I saw him on the street. In the end, I couldn’t take the pressure
anymore. I fled the village.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>At that time, I didn’t have anything with me except the
clothes I was in. The little amount of money I earned from the takoyaki shop
had been spent on the journey, the food I bought thoroughly consumed even
before reaching this town. Upon my arrival at Unomichi, I hadn’t had anything
to eat for two days. I tried looking for work. None accepted me. The rest of
the day dragged painfully by with me sitting in an empty alley while hunger
clawed madly at my stomach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I was leaning against a wall of the alley, trying to put
myself to sleep when three men emerged from the entrance. The moment I noticed
the leer on their lips, I knew I had to run. There were only so many things men
wanted to do when they looked at a girl that way, you know. One problem,
though, the alley had but one way out, and they were blocking it. Frightened silly,
I only stared as the men walked toward me, their grins growing wider after
every step they took. I tried to stand up and run. All I managed to do was
crawling away, all the while hearing the footsteps falling behind my back. I
started to cry once they rolled me onto my back, two of them pinning my arms
and legs to the ground while the last one towered over my sprawled body. I
desperately screamed for help. Yet even when my voice became hoarse, even when
the bastard ripped my clothes apart, no one came.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Ah, don’t worry, Nikki-chan. They didn’t manage to do
anything to me at all. In fact, I even felt <i>sorry</i> for them afterwards.
It was <i>they</i> who made a fatal mistake choosing to attack <i>me</i>. You
remember, don’t you, Nikki-chan, that the demonic blood in me would awaken at
my command. The three men were able to pin me down because I was too frightened
to <i>remember</i> that I was capable of tearing them into pieces. When the
shock had faded and the anger arisen, I <i>did</i>.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Just like what had happened to my dad, a powerful wave of
white light emerged and hauled the three men off of my body. What they found
themselves confronting in the end was a <i>kitsune</i> <i>youkai</i> as tall as
any man and thrice as large. Seeing my claws and sharp teeth, they weren’t very
happy. Unfortunately for them, neither was I.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>My first strike severed an arm of the man who ripped my
clothes. My second took away a leg. Blood splashed onto the ground and the
walls of the alley, painting them red. My prey passed out on the spot without
letting out the smallest cry. I was preparing to sink my claws into his throat
and finish him once and for all when something flickered at the edge of my
vision. The other two men were running away, abandoning their comrade. Knowing
my anger wouldn’t be sated unless I got all three, I chased after them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>Dear Nikki-chan, they only made it to the empty town square,
where they found themselves pinned onto the ground under my paws. This time, it
was they who started to scream. I silenced them by shifting all my weight onto
my front limbs, driving all the air out of their lungs. I could even hear their
ribs crack as they squirmed in pain. I could even smell the blood trickling out
of their mouth. I could even see their eyes trying to jump out of their sockets.
Truth be told, I would have pressed harder and crushed them to death had a
voice even colder than the night winds not reached my ears.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Looking up, I saw a slim figure cloaked in the shadow of the roof
of a house nearby. Nikki-chan, I was pretty shocked at that. You probably don’t
know, but my demon form did gift me with extremely heightened senses. Despite
the fact that I was occupied with my preys, I still should have noticed that
someone was there. I never did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The figure stepped forward into the silvery light radiating from
the full moon on high. It was a girl perhaps a few years older than I was in my
human form, but a hundred times prettier. Her long raven hair, tied at the nape
of her neck with a snowy ribbon, formed a long, tidy tail that ended at her waist.
The hair at the sides of her slender half-oval face fell all the way to each of
her jawlines in a wide stream of glorious darkness. Her large eyes, pretty and
deep, gleamed obsidian in the moonlight. Her small nose and lips delivered the
finishing touches to the most dazzling face ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>My breath caught when my eyes traveled below the girl’s neck.
Her upper body was clad in a white robe worn over a red <i>kimono</i> shirt.
Her wide sleeves, fringed with red velvet, stopped at her wrists, revealing
small, delicate hands. A divided red <i>hibakama</i> graced her lower body;
white stockings and red <i>tabi </i>sandals adorned her feet. There was no
doubt. The girl standing before me was what my mom used to be before she left the
<i>Grand Shrine of Ise</i>. A Priestess.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>In my <i>kitsune</i> <i>youkai</i> form, I slowly backed up
from the two men, who crawled away from me as fast as they could while moaning
in pain. The Priestess never paid any scrap of attention to them. Her obsidian
eyes, glowing with hatred and distaste, were fixed on me alone. I didn’t have
to be a genius to guess that she meant to destroy me, which of course, neither
the beast I had become nor my human self, locked inside the beast’s head, could
permit. My demonic blood sang in my veins, urging me to kill the pest. Nikki-chan,
I’m ashamed to admit that I didn’t take a lot of time reconsidering before I
obeyed.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>I jumped at her viciously, bared fangs and claws aiming for
her throat. Unfazed, she only put up her left hand. Light flared from her
fingertips in colorful sprays that painted concentric magic circles spinning
about her palm in various angles and directions. In a deafening sound, my front
body crashed into what I knew was a barrier wrought solely for physical
defense, and was hurled back with a force much stronger than what I had employed.
I landed at least thirty feet away from the girl, every muscle on my body sore
from the impact. My front paws were in an even worse situation. They hurt so badly
I could have thought I just stepped on a bush of thorns.</p>

grant you a quick, painless death.” I favored her with a thunderous roar. Her
expression never changed.</p>

side, palm erected. “<i><span style='font-family:"Footlight MT Light"'>O

text-indent:.5in'>The silvery light of the moon on high gathered into a
brilliant shaft that banished the darkness. It was as if she had succeeded in
summoning the moon itself. Well, she didn’t. What appeared in her hand afterwards
was a very unusual sword. The hand-guard was nowhere in sight, and the hilt a white
lacquered wood so well-polished that it seemed too slippery to hold. Yet, the
rest of it was a wonder to look at. Slightly curved, the long blade was made
entirely of transparent glass that made it seem more like a beautiful
ornamental piece than an actual weapon.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Halfway in the swinging arc, the sword blazed at the same
time brilliant sparks emerged around its blade. The latter, multiplying in a
terrifying rate, then gathered into the former and made its length grow rapidly.
In the blink of an eye, the prickly tip of <i>Sennen no Inori</i> had traversed
the distance between us and arrived at my left side, ready to slice my leg off.
Had I failed to react in time and leap a few steps backwards, it would have. And
that was <i>nothing</i> compared to what happened next.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Despite the fact that the Priestess never moved an inch from
her initial position, she was death incarnate. She merely stood on the ground,
her body perfectly still except for her wrist, which directed <i>Sennen no
Inori</i>, but the sword’s blazing shaft – crisscrossing soundlessly in the air
like a flexible thin ribbon, which seemed able to change direction at will – appeared
everywhere within the empty space of the town square. Thanks to the darn thing,
I accumulated at least a hundred wounds – none was fatal, I was grateful toward
whatever power out there for that – within the first ten minutes of the fight.</p>

extremely bold and overly confident; yet the blood that dyed my fur red and the
pain that tore at my body slammed fear back into my head. Also, I had regained
enough sense to realize that should this continue, I’d die. There was simply no
way I could win. I fled Unomichi.</p>

While I was running so fast the winds howled fiercely in my ears and the
scenery became a blur that rushed the opposite direction, she was right behind
me. Taking leaps so wide and high she gave me impression that she was lighter
than a feather, she continued to swing that monstrous – ironic, I know – <i>Sennen

text-indent:.5in'>My chance to escape came when I caught sight of a forest
straight ahead. Ducking my head to evade one last slash from <i>Sennen no Inori</i>,
I threw myself between the trees bordering the darkness that grew thicker and
thicker with every step. I immediately discarded my demon form and changed back
into being a human, for a large <i>kitsune</i> would have a very tough time slipping
past the trees.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Naked as the day I was born, I ventured deeper into the
forest while the cold air bit at my skin and the rocks on the ground pricked my
feet. I didn’t stop running until I found a small cave the entrance to which
was covered by thick bushes with thorny leaves. I heaved a great sigh of
relieve after a while of feeling around of my hands in pitch darkness and
finding that there was nothing else except me. Time passed in silence as I sat
against the cave’s rocky wall, where I hugged my knees as tightly as I could
and listened for any sound that might warn me of the Priestess. I fell asleep
shortly afterwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>Stop laughing at me, Nikki-chan! I was only a teenage girl
who had wrung out every drop of sweet running from an enemy. It was only
natural that I became too tired to keep my eyes open, don’t you think? And
don’t say anything about my choice of hiding inside a cave either, please? I
know it wasn’t the best idea, regarding how I would have become dead meat had
the Priestess discovered that I was lurking in there, not to mention that I
could have found a den of vipers waiting to sink their fangs into my flesh or a
bear – are there bears in Hokkaido? – staring at his dinner…. Um… I’m not
making myself look any better, am I?</p>

text-indent:.5in'>When the light of dawn slipped past the foliage and woke me
up, every muscle on my body was sore, and my skin was covered with cuts and
bruises. It didn’t help that my stomach was growling loudly, either. It was
then that my nose caught a delicious smell and my ears heard the snapping
sounds of a flame burning on dry twigs. <i>‘Someone was cooking something out
there’,</i> I thought. Mouth watering, I gingerly got on all four and peered
through a small opening between the leaves of the bush hiding the entrance to
the cave. What I saw increased my hunger ten-fold.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>A young man dark of hair and eyes, in a samurai’s armor and
outfit, two <i>katana</i> hanging at his belt, was seated on a slab of stone
behind a cooking fire, over which he was roasting a rabbit. I would have run out
there and grabbed it had I not realized that I wasn’t wearing a stitch on my
body. I was wondering whether I should change into the <i>kitsune</i> form to
chase the man away when he suddenly spoke, “Come out, girl, I know you’re
hungry.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I had been so startled that my head hit the low roof of the
cave in a loud, painful <i>CONK</i>. I let out a small ‘<i>Oww’</i> as colorful
stars erupted in my vision. The man outside merely chuckled, sounding amused.</p>

can’t guarantee there’ll be any leftover.”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

into the cave for me instead?”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You don’t need to be shy, girl. I’m not interested in you
whether you have clothes on or not.” I gave another start hearing him say that.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Silence passed between us, with me wondering how the man
could have known I was in the cave – naked! – and what he could possibly want
with me, until he reached behind him and took out a large black cloak. Then he bundled
it up and tossed it at the entrance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>After I had taken the piece of cloth and wrapped it decently
around my body, I left my hiding place and sat down next to him. I wasn’t
afraid at all, despite him being a samurai bearing swords, as I could change
back into my demon form and put him in his place.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>We shared the roasted rabbit and ate, each of us pursuing our
own thoughts. I would once in a while steal glances at the man to make sure he
wasn’t trying anything funny, and he would shake his head and chuckle quietly every
time he caught me doing it. After the hundredth time or so, he threw up his
hands in exasperation and said irritably, “Oh come on! Would you stop that? When
I say I’m not interested, I mean it!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

“Men are beasts. Or at least most of them are.”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

some bad experience with men, no?”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Some of them tried to rape me the last night,” I muttered
darkly to him. Nikki-chan, even <i>now</i>, I still think that it’s hard to
distinguish between men and monsters, and decide which were more dangerous.
Demons killed men, true, but it wasn’t as if men didn’t anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Is that so? Is that so?” He laughed and ruffled the messy
hair on my head. “Rest assured though, kiddo, you’re safe now. I’ll protect you
from now on.” Nikki-chan, I was both shocked and amused at that time. From the
man’s youthful face, I was sure that the age difference between us couldn’t
have been more than three years, yet he called me <i>“kiddo</i>” and acted as
though he was my father. To tell you the truth, I didn’t enjoy being treated
that way, at all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I studied him for a while, and suddenly had an idea why he
was so detached when he had a young, seemingly helpless girl wearing nothing
but a cloak at his side. I poked his shoulder with my finger and asked, “You
like men, don’t you?” The shocked look he gave me in return was most satisfying.
It wouldn’t be fair if I was the one surprised all the times, don’t you think, Nikki-chan?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>Um, well, Nikki-chan, you must be thinking that I’m a rude
girl without any manner at all. I’m not, really! I’m just curious in nature, so
I couldn’t have helped myself even if I had tried to, that’s all!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well, yes,” the man said after clearing his throat. He even
looked a trifle embarrassed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Only a perv would go after someone of his own gender.” I
stuck out my tongue at him. “Isn’t that true?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No it isn’t, you ignoramus! You haven’t heard that you can’t
choose the one you fall in love with, no?” he said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I didn’t buy a thing he said, for I thought he was just
trying to find an excuse for his pervy nature. But of course, attacking his <i>particular</i>
taste right after he had clothed me and fed me would turn me into ungrateful
brat, so I held my tongue. Silence returned.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How are you feeling, kiddo?” he spoke finally. “Are your
wounds okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“They aren’t,” I mumbled. “Still hurt a lot.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Okay, then.” He put his hand back on my head. At the
contact, a wave of something, cool and soothing like a balm, swept over me.
Next I knew, there wasn’t a scratch left on my body. “There we go,” he said,
and I gave a start. Noticing the fear in my eyes, he added, “Don’t worry, kiddo,
I’m not an exorcist. I would have killed you already if I were one, agree?” He
never withdrew his hand.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>If he thought he could calm me down with his assurance, he
was wrong. He only managed to make me more frightened. My whole body trembled,
as did my voice, when I opened my mouth and spoke, “You’re a demon, aren’t you?”
The casual nod he gave stilled my tongue and sent chills slithering down my
back.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Allow me to introduce myself, kiddo,” he said, smiling. “I’m
Kugimiya Karasu, from the Kugimiya Crow Demon Clan. Pleased to make your
acquaintance.” A pair of wings black as a moonless night unfolded from behind
his back, which made the fear from the night before, staked into my heart by
the Priestess, come alive stronger than ever. When it comes to a half-breed, a
demon should be as loving and friendly as an exorcist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No need to be so afraid, kiddo,” he said, his hand gently
stroking my head. “As long as you cooperate, I won’t harm you. I give you my
word.” I suddenly became aware that the fingernails on both of his hands had
grown longer, sharper, and much pricklier. No doubt he would sink them into my
brain as soon as I refused to ‘<i>cooperate’</i>. The knowledge made me tremble
even more wildly, and much more conscious of his hand at the top of my head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What… do you… want?” I asked him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Something only you can help me achieve,” he answered. “You
see, kiddo, my <i>source</i> in the town you visited last night told me what
happened between you and the Priestess. He also revealed that despite being a
demon, you could slip into town without alerting <i>Seinaru Suishou</i>. Would
you tell me why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“<i>Sei… naru… Suishou</i>? What?” My teeth clattered. Karasu
didn’t radiate any menacing aura that I could sense, and he was quite the
gentleman, yet somehow he scared me even more than the girl the night before
did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Ah, sorry, sorry.” He chuckled. “<i>Seinaru Suishou</i>, or
the <i>Sacred Crystals</i>, are devices that detect demonic presence. To put it
simply, they cast a large Ward around Unomichi. Every time a demon wanders
inside, the <i>Crystals</i> would chime, and the Priestess would come to
destroy him, or her,” he added, winking at me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>In a cracking voice, I told him that I wasn’t a demon, that I
was only a half-breed, and that I had no idea why the <i>Crystals</i> or
whatever failed to work in my case. I almost whimpered when he arched an
eyebrow at me. Still, he only studied me intently, his dark eyes so unnerving
that I actually sighed in relief when he shifted his gaze from me to the
burning fire in front of us.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Sounds like you have a dominating human trait…” he muttered.
“But how? I’ve never seen such a half-breed in my life. And I’ve killed
hundreds of them, you know.” His casual words sent goosebumps rising all over
my skin. Never noticing it, he became immersed in his own thoughts, eyes still
fixed at the fire. After half an hour or so, Karasu demanded that I tell him
all about my family. He didn’t really say it out right, but he hinted that he
could tell if I lied, and he’d make me regret ever doing it. So I told him what
he wanted to know. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> “Oh I see, I see!” Karasu burst into laughter. “You’re the child
of that famous Nine-Tail Shirazuki Rin and the Priestess Kazahara Kozue! You’ve
inherited both of your pop and mom’s powers at birth, which simply canceled
each other out! That’s why there isn’t an ounce of demonic power in you. That’s
how you fooled the <i>Crystals</i>! This is just perfect! Perfect I say!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Perfect… for what?” I stared at him. When his hand slid from
the top of my head to my face, which he gripped tightly, I knew something bad
was going to happen. I was right.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh, for a great many things,” he said cheerfully. “You just
don’t need to know what yet.” His palm and his fingertips grew warmer, his
black wings blacker, and I more frightened with ever word he spoke. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“The process won’t take too long, kiddo, so try to bear with it,”
Karasu whispered, and the heat of a thousand suns exploded within his grip
while nerve-wrecking pain surged across my body. I screamed, feeling as though
my limbs were tied to four horses running in different directions. Karasu… he
only laughed harder and harder. I passed out shortly afterwards.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>The weather today isn’t better than yesterday at all. It’s
already noon, but the sun’s still hiding behind the dark clouds that threaten
another heavy rain. It’s because of them that I don’t dare hang the laundry
over the clotheslines. In times like this, I only wish I possess some sort of
special powers. It’d be awesome if I could dry all the laundry with a wave of
my hand, or prepare food without actually going into the kitchen. Silly, aren’t
I? If I had powers, the <i>Sacred Crystals </i>would have chimed the moment I
stepped into Unomichi, and the people would have killed me before I could
twitch. If I had powers, Kugimiya Karasu would have found me useless, and
probably wouldn’t have kept me alive. And of course, if I had an ounce of
powers, I wouldn’t have ended up in <i>Furisame</i>, where I found the most
precious treasure in the world. But I’m jumping ahead.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Let me tell you about what happened after I regained my
consciousness. When I opened my eyes, the sun was setting, and I was lying upon
the grassy ground, with Karasu’s sitting where he used to, black wings no where
in sight. He broke into a smile the moment he noticed that I had woken up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Feeling alright, kiddo?” He grinned as I rose slowly to my
feet. “Oh, be careful, or you’ll ruin your clothes.” It was only then did I realize
that what I had on my body was no longer Karasu’s black cloak, but a simple
brown<i> yukata</i> any servant in any household would wear. I had stockings
and <i>tabi</i> sandals on, too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You do look pretty.” Karasu nodded. “But hey, why are you
backing away from me?”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What did you do to me?” I asked, feeling anger and fear rising
in my heart, the latter overwhelming the former. I tried not to remember the
pain he had caused me earlier in the day, lest it turn my knees into water. He
was scary enough as it was already. I gave a start, however, noticing that my
voice had changed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well, instead of me answering, why don’t you look at this?”
Karasu snapped his fingers. A silvery surface that looked like a mirror as tall
as I was appeared in front of me. I gasped aloud as I looked at my reflection.
Everything about me had changed. My face had grown more slender, my eyes
larger, my nose smaller, and my lips thinner. Even my hairstyle was no longer
the same. What I used to have was hair long enough to reach my waist, not short
straight hair with bangs ruffling in front of my forehead and ringlets brushing
my ears. Admittedly, though, I had never looked more beautiful.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Because I can’t let you keep yours. You’re wanted, remember?”
He winked at me. “But forget about that for a second and listen. You’re going
back to Unomichi, for the Priestess would visit the town for some business the
day after next. You’ll approach her for me.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>“Shush!” Annoyance flashed across Karasu’s face. “There’s
nothing to worry about. If <i>Seinaru Suishou</i> can’t identify you as a
half-breed, neither can she. She’ll take you for a human.” His face hardened
upon seeing that I still shook my head vigorously. Saying nothing, he glanced
over his shoulder at a large tree, at which he flung his right hand. For the
first five seconds or so, nothing happened. At the sixth, a gust of wind rose,
and the tree along with its branches and leaves crumbled into to dust. As the
winds continued to blow, nothing was left of the mighty wooden pillar that
seemed more than able to survive the heaviest storms. Cold sweats rolled down
my back, and my knees gave way. I sank to the ground, trembling.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh, what was I saying kiddo?” Karasu looked at me, his lips
widening in a smile, “you are to go back to Unomichi and approach the Priestess
for me. You understand perfectly, yes?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes,” I mumbled meekly. ‘What am I going to tell her?”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, Karasu gave me somewhat of an oral <i>script</i>,
which was really short, but he spent the rest of the evening and the next day
making me repeat it over and over until I could say every line without
forgetting the next. The morning after, he took me to the border of the forest,
from where there was a road leading to a large town perhaps five or six minutes
of walking distance away. It wasn’t where I entered the forest in hope of escaping
the Priestess two days ago, though. Beyond the tiled roofs of Unomichi, fringed
by numerous luxuriant rice fields halfway through the rice season, stood
another forest that seemed much thicker and deeper than the one I was in at
that time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“See that one, kiddo?” Karasu said, hand gesturing toward a tall
archway flanked by two watchtowers. I nodded, and he continued, “That’s called
the Southern Gate. See the two-story building tiled in red beyond it? Good.
That’s the local branch of the government’s Colonization Office. The Priestess
should be in there right now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Your <i>source</i> told you, I suppose?” I muttered.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Exactly.” He winked. “Oh, oh, our helper’s here.” A man, the
same getup as Kugimiya Karasu but less handsome, a head taller, and much more
severe-looking, stepped out from behind a tree to our left.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

“Everything’s ready.”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Let me introduce you to my servant, kiddo.” Karasu smiled
pleasantly. “His name’s Akiba. Akiba, this is your responsibility for the next half
an hour or so.” Strangely, although I gave him a polite bow, Akiba shot me a
look that was barely friendlier than what the Priestess did before she
proceeded to attack. At that time, I thought he was just hostile in nature, for
there was no other reason why he should hate someone he met for the first time.
Only later did I find out that I was sorely mistaken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“We’ll wait for the Priestess to leave, and then we’ll
execute our plan….” He paused. “Okay, that’s freaky.” The gates to the
Colonization Office swung open, and a slender figure walked out. Young, yet
somehow possessing a presence that could shame an Imperial princess, the
Priestess’s beauty seemed to even dwarf the glory of the sunlight. Nikki-chan,
my new face’s prettier than most girls’ are, yet I would be nothing standing
next to her. To compare us would be to compare a firefly and the sun, a
wildflower grown at the side of the road and a rose tended with utmost care in
one’s precious garden. She’s a gemstone, and I but a grain of sand one can find
on any beach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> “Now, little <i>kitsune</i>-chan, you can go,” Karasu pat me
on the back. “Be quick, or Akiba will kill you.” He was smiling as usual, he
even winked, yet the mere curving of his lips and the glint in his dark eyes
were so menacing that I thought I was a fox cornered by a hunter with a bow.
“Well?” He arched an eyebrow at me, and I ran as though hell was on my heels.
Akiba, on the other hand, didn’t move an inch, his face grimmer by the minute.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>After I had gotten around three or four yards away from the
forest, I heard violent flaps of wings overhead. Looking up, I felt my heart
sinking into my stomach upon seeing a giant crow as large as a small house. It
was Akiba in his demon form, and he was chasing after me. Knowing that
everything was an act didn’t make me feel any safer, really. I ran harder, and
faster, and screamed for help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, the plan that Karasu had drawn out was relatively
simple. I was to leave the forest, followed by Akiba, screaming like any
helpless girl chased after by a demon. Of course, the Priestess was nearby, so
she would notice me. Obviously she would attack Akiba and rescue me, like any
decent exorcist would. Well, the plan itself was simple, true, but the
execution was hard. If I wanted to fool the Priestess, my acting needed to be
as realistic as possible. To “<i>help</i>” me do that, Karasu told me he had
ordered Akiba to attack me <i>for real</i>. Yeah, that meant Akiba was free to
give me as many wounds as necessary without actually killing me. To tell you
the truth, Nikki-chan, I didn’t think Akiba would bat an eyelid if he ripped me
apart. I couldn’t have been more correct, really. The way Akiba, in his
gigantic crow form, tried to grab me with his claws with his every dive, I
believed he meant to send me to the grave, and Karasu’s order be hanged. Had I
not frantically tried to evade him, he <i>would have</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>With sweat drenching my face, blood surging in my veins,
colorful sparks hurrying across my vision, and a terrible cramp crawling up my
legs, not to count rocks and dirt blowing up all around me every five seconds
or so, it was a wonder how I didn’t fall and become minced meat beneath Akiba’s
claw. My heart was beating so fast it ached terribly in my chest; my throat
hurt so much from shouting my voice grew weaker and weaker. Fortunately for me,
the Priestess heard me, or perhaps saw me – I couldn’t tell which – for she
looked in my direction as she reached out her hand. Then she unleashed death. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>A searing-bright column of liquid golden fire, thicker than
any tree I had ever seen, soared forth from her hand. It only took a second for
the spell to engulf the monstrosity that was Akiba in his true form. The
gigantic demon crashed into the ground, where he thrashed and crowed out in
pain as the flame consumed him alive. He started to change then. His feathers
disappeared one by one, perhaps wilted by the heat, I couldn’t say; his wings
withdrew into his back as humans arms sprouted from his side. He grew smaller
and smaller, too. In heartbeats, he reappeared as the man in samurai outfit
with which he revealed himself to Kugimiya Karasu. Looking at Akiba, rolling on
the ground just a few yards away, and hearing him screaming, I couldn’t help
but pity him.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I was turning around, intending to go toward the Priestess,
when I heard her cry, “RUN, NOW!” at the same time that Akiba bellowed, “YOU DO
NOT DESERVE TO LIVE!” The flame-wreathed figure of the demon towered over me
from behind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Frozen in fright and fazed by the scorching heat, I only stared
wordlessly at Akiba, whose flesh was breaking apart from his body, trying to
put him arms around me, undoubtedly wanting to take me along with him to the
grave. He never succeeded – of course, if he did, I wouldn’t be here writing to
you, Nikki-chan – thanks to the Priestess. I never noticed it, but she already had
her sword <i>Sennen no Inori</i> in hand, which she swung the way she would a
whip. In the blink of an eye, the sword’s blade extended soundlessly, overcame
the distance, and pierced Akiba’s heart, knocking him backwards.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>You know ne, Nikki-chan, I was scared to death at that point.
The Priestess’s blade was dangerously close to the side of my face. Had she
missed her target by a few inches, <i>Sennen no Inori</i> would have punched
through <i>my</i> head. I could have died twice on the same day, you see. The
knowledge was the last straw of a series of fatal moments and bad experiences I
had undergone, which was too much for me to bear, so I crumbled into a heap on
the ground and passed out. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, everything in the world seemed to be against me
at that point. Even after I was knocked out cold, I couldn’t rest. A nightmare
seized me and showed me the horrible sight of Kugimiya Karasu grabbing me by
the throat, my feet dangling a few inches off the ground. The crow demon was
laughing madly while tightening his grip and letting his knife-sharp
fingernails cutting into my skin. <i>“Remember, little kitsune-chan,” </i>he
said. <i>“Remember the price of failure.” </i>Nikki-chan, I don’t know about
how other people’s dreams work, but when Karasu strangled me in mine, it hurt!
Fortunately for me, I woke up before he managed to kill me. Yet, the pressure
of his hand around my throat didn’t fade, and it <i>still</i> hurt. Nikki-chan,
my whole body was drenched with sweat at that time, and I was so busy gasping
for breath that I never realized I wasn’t alone until a cool, melodious voice
spoke right next to me, “Are you alright?” I gave a start and screamed hearing
that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The Priestess, who once attempted to dissect me, was sitting
in the <i>seiza</i> fashion next to the futon on which I sat, hands folded
neatly on her laps, face a mask of unflappable serenity. The only thing that I
didn’t remember seeing on her the first time we met was the warm glow in her
deep obsidian eyes, which made her more beautiful than ever. Nikki-chan, I
think no man aside from the likes of Kugimiya Karasu could look at her and <i>not</i>
want to pull her into his arms and kiss her. Small chance they can do that,
though. If she’s able to destroy a demon like Akiba seemingly without trying,
she surely can crush any man who thinks he can have his ways with her.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Uh, yes,” I answered timidly. “Um, if I may ask, ane-san,
who’re you?” It was the first line of the script Kugimiya Karasu had taught me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I’m sorry, but do I know you?” I told her, and her face
paled. Silence hung between us until it was broken by a man’s voice coming from
outside the room, “May I come in?”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Please do, Shichou-san,” the Priestess said, her eyes still
fixed on my face. The shoji door slid aside, admitting a stocky man perhaps a
few years into his forties, who donned a black kimono for men with a
retractable paper fan stuck at the sash around his waist. Despite his fatherly
appearance, he smiled as soon as he saw me, the very sight of him soured my
stomach.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Eh?” He blinked in evident surprise, then turned to look at the
Priestess, who was too immersed in staring at me to notice. Her unrelenting gaze
was most uncomfortable. “Why do you ask?” he told me finally.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

while thumping the side my head with my tiny fist. “I lost all my memory a year
ago, when I fell on my head from the top of a stair, you see.” The Priestess’s
beautiful eyes widened at the same time her lips compressed into a thin line,
which I wasn’t sure whether out of anger or shock. “This ane-san,” I gestured
my hand toward the raven-haired girl, “acted like I should know her, so I was
wondering if you are as well.”</p>

his head slightly. “Pleased to meet you.”</p>

they? Where is this place? Why am I here?” I cried, clutching my head with both
of my hands, “Why don’t I remember anything?”</p>

Office. You were chased to this town by a demon.” the Mayor said. “And you collapsed,
so we brought you here.” He hesitated. “As to your master and mistress, I have
bad news.” The Priestess shot him a silencing look. He pretended that she didn’t.
“We found many broken carriages in the woods, and a lot of blood on the ground,
but no sight of any humans or horses. We believe they have fallen victim to a
demonic attack. May their souls rest in peace.” He concluded in a commiserating
voice.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Dear Nikki-chan, I was just acting at first, trying to fake
my grief in a way that could fool the Priestess… yet the more I elaborated on
how blissful my fictitious life was, the more I was reminded of my own. The
more I talked about my non-existent master and mistress, how they treated me
like one of their children, the more I remembered my late mom and dad, and the
more my eyes stung, my voice quivered, and my heart ached. In the end, I
couldn’t take it anymore, so I broke out crying for real. Both the Mayor and
the Priestess were stunned, the latter quite angry with the former, both
extremely uncomfortable. I soon forgot about them, though, as I buried my face
in my hands and wept.</p>

and I was able to make myself stop crying. The raven-haired girl silently handed
me a handkerchief, which I accepted with a nod of gratitude. When I dried my
tears with the silky piece of cloth, elegantly sewn with a golden lily at one
corner, I noticed a faint fragrance that didn’t resemble that of any flower I
knew. It smelled really nice, though.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Do you have to go there, Shichou-san?” the Priestess put in
coolly; her eyes were obsidian augers boring at the stocky man. Face paled to
the color of a blank sheet of paper, he clamped his mouth shut immediately.
Nikki-chan, it was amazing, really, how she could intimidate a man at least
twice her age, a government official at that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It’s okay,” I told the man in a tattered voice, “I... I
think I’m going back to Kyoto. I hope I can find a new master there.”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It shall be difficult, Amano-san,” the Priestess said. “Do
you have money left?” She continued after a shake of my head, “The way from
here to the nearest port is quite long and treacherous, as you have known. Worse,
it would also mean that you <i>will</i> have to cross Sengimori Forest once
more.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Sengimori?” I asked curiously.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“The Forest of a Thousand Demons,” the raven-haired girl
answered smoothly. “Where you emerged from earlier this morning. I do not
suppose you want to go in there ever again.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No!” I frantically shook my head.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Then would you consider staying here?” A smile lit up her
dazzling face. She didn’t look anything like the murderous exorcist who chased
me into the forest, into Kugimiya Karasu’s palm and his wretched scheme.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You know a household that would take me in, ane-san?” I
asked her while leaning slightly toward her, trying to appear hopeful. It
looked like I succeeded, for the Priestess’s smile broadened, and a faint color
crept onto her cheeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I am afraid I do not know any that needs a servant in this
town,” she said. “But I do know someone who is seeking a helper.” Unbeknownst
to the Priestess, the Mayor’s lips curved upward in a satisfied smile. The man
started to dry wash his hand in expectation, glee evident on his sweat-drenched
face. He did have good cause to, of course, but I wished he wouldn’t do that
right next to the Priestess, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Who is it?” I turned my attention back to the other girl.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Myself. I manage a Shrine nearby, and am in desperate need for
an assistant.” She smiled again. “The pay is not as good as what you get from a
distinguished household, of course, but at least food and shelter would be the
last thing you need to worry about. So, would you consider my offer?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, you can only imagine how happy I was to finally
hear that from the Priestess’s mouth. After all, everything the Mayor and I
said in this conversation was a calculated farce aimed at making her ask me to
come to her Shrine. And yeah, Sadamoto Shun'ichi himself was Kugimiya Karasu’s
minion through and through. The Mayor was lying through his teeth when he
claimed to have found broken carriages with blood sprayed all over them in the
forest. I never had the chance to verify it but he should also be the one who
informed the crow demon of what happened in the village the night I met the
Priestess, of the fact that she would be coming to the Colonization Office on
that day, and finally that the she had been walking around town asking people whether
they would like to help her out at her Shrine. Kugimiya Karasu hadn’t thought
much of those pieces of information until he met me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, you must be thinking what Kugimiya Karasu hopes
to achieve by sending me into the Priestess’s Shrine. You know ne; the crow
demon has an unquenchable thirst for power. Yeah, he really is, I tell you, although
the Kugimiya is among the most powerful Clans of the Demon World, and Karasu
himself stands higher than any in his own Clan except his father and his
siblings. Karasu doesn’t sit very well with that. He told me that his father,
Kugimiya Ryuha, had been heading the Clan for almost a thousand years straight
and refused to step down from power. The thing that upset Karasu the most was
that even if Kugimiya Ryuha did, the throne would most likely fall into the
hand of one of his numerous brothers or sisters. <i>“Pop never approves my
liking… ahem… other men,”</i> Karasu explained in a frustrated tone, <i>“so
there’s no way in hell he’d let me succeed him.” </i>The man was determined to
change that, so he planned ways to take his own father down. Ungrateful bastard
of a son, isn’t he?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>This is where the Priestess comes into the picture.
Nikki-chan, Karasu told me that in order to defeat Kugimiya Ryuha, he needed a
powerful magical weapon, and that one of the most powerful of all was the sword
<i>Sennen no Inori</i>, <i>A Thousand Years of Prayers</i>, in the Priestess’s
possession. Karasu wants it so very badly that he even dreams of it every
night. One problem, he isn’t strong enough to take it from the girl’s hand. The
Priestess’s already as strong as him, maybe stronger, so with the aid of <i>Sennen
no Inori</i>, she was way out his league. The knowledge infuriates him no end.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Of course, if brute force doesn’t work, underhanded methods
must be employed. Kugimiya Karasu decided to steal the sword, which happens to
be the <i>goshintai</i> of the Priestess’s Shrine. Another problem, even the
most powerful demon in the world isn’t capable of entering the Shrine, as it’s
protected by a Sacred Barrier so strong that a low-level demon can die just by standing
next to it. Even Kugimiya Karasu wouldn’t survive a direct contact with the
thing. Such is the reason why the crow demon hasn’t been able to snatch <i>Sennen
no Inori</i> and launch himself at his father.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, you’ve noticed why Karasu wants to use me,
haven’t you? Yeah, it’s because I’m a half-breed whose dominating human trait
renders any Ward or Barrier useless. I can get into the Shrine without any
difficulty, and I can steal <i>Sennen no Inori</i> for him once I find out
where it is. No, no, that’s wrong, Nikki-chan, just picking a human to do his
biddings won’t work. You see, a human has many things to fear from a demon like
Kugimiya Karasu, but none from an exorcist. There was no guarantee that the
human, whomever the man chose, wouldn’t betray him the moment they met the
Priestess and revealed Karasu’s scheme. It’s a whole different story with me,
for I had everything to fear from the Priestess. Humans treat our kind the same
way they do full-blooded demons, you know. Any exorcist would skin me should
they find out I’m a half-breed. Which, unfortunately, made me the perfect
target for Kugimiya Karasu to bully. If I disobey him, I will die by either his
hand or the Priestess’s. The only way out is getting Karasu what he wanted, <i>Sennen
no Inori</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You do not have to answer me immediately, Amano-san,” the
Priestess said, still smiling. From the painful experience of our first
encounter, I never thought she was the type who liked to smile. I was wrong,
obviously. “I can come back in three days and ask you again. Meanwhile, I believe
I can find you lodging in the Izumi Inn across the street. Free of charge, of
course. Since the inn keeper owes me a favor, she would be perfectly happy to
accommodate you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No need, ane-san,” I told her. “I agree.” A broad smile
split the girl’s face into two.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Are you quite sure? I would rather you think my offer
through in a couple of days, perhaps after I have told you what I would require
from an assistant,” the Priestess advised. Nikki-chan, the girl wasn’t telling
the truth. The gleam in her obsidian eyes all but tell me she wanted me to
ignore all she said and just answer yes. I did, and was stunned by the brilliant
glow of joy that settled upon her already striking face. Nikki-chan, had you
been there, I’m sure you would have thought that I had given her the Imperial Throne
instead of a simple word. I never understood why until recently, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Congratulation on finding a helper, Fuyuu-kun.” The Mayor
laughed a rich laughter, appearing infinitely relieved. Of course, failure in
getting me employed by the Priestess would mean his death, which he couldn’t
possibly enjoy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Fuyuu? Is that your name, ane-san?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Ah, how very rude of me,” the Priestess said ruefully. “We
have been talking for so long yet I never introduce myself. I am called Fuyuu
Kotonoha, Chief Priestess of <i>Furisame Jinja</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Yeah, Nikki-chan, on that fateful day, I became Kotonoha’s
housemate and her personal assistant in the <i>Shrine of the Falling Rain</i>,
where I’m living in now. You must be surprised, ne, how I’ve been speaking of
her so fondly despite the fact that she almost killed me once, that I’m
supposed to keep a distance from her and focus on stealing the <i>goshintai</i>
of <i>Furisame Jinja</i>. Well, that’s the story for another day. I’m really
sorry, Nikki-chan, but I’ve got some urgent thing to do, which may take the
rest of the evening, so I’ll see you tomorrow. Jaa ne.</p>
