<p>“Space Station: heroes rise to  overcome the crisis!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Athena Sifr and Fuuka Fujiwara  smiled warmly at each other as they snuck out of their room, fresh  and glowing after an impromptu sexual escapade. They couldn’t help  it: the time they spent apart on that dreadful world had affected  them deeply, even more so because Athena knew in her heart that her  time with Fuuka was short, and that in a few years— eight, maybe  nine at most— her beloved would have rotted away into a desiccated  shell of her former self, and would then perish in pain, the victim  of a fatal nerve dysfunction. That she still devoted her life to joy  and healing was a testament to her indomitable (one could even say  her <em>dauntless</em>) courage. Athena didn’t take a single moment  for granted, and so once the two soulmates were reunited, they began  to make up for lost time. Slipping into their room at the station for  a little lovemaking was just one of the methods they employed.</p>
<p>But now, it seemed, the halls of the  space station were lifeless. The two women held hands as they stepped  across the hallway towards the main pavilion, feeling wary all of a  sudden. Athena’s senses were slightly sharper than her lover’s,  due to the extensive training and tests she went through in her  former life, so she was the first to really believe something was  wrong. She released Morisato from his slumber and held it aloft,  shielding Fuuka with her free arm. Their presence was soon noticed as  twenty figures, each one indistinguishable thanks to their dark  clothes and protective gear, stormed into the hallway, bearing stun  guns and electric prods. Athena bristled as she glared at them.</p>
<p>“So what the hell is this,  someone’s idea of a prank?”</p>
<p>“Lay down your weapon and come  with us!” one of the figures shouted. The voice was scrambled and  distorted, so even Athena could not tell if it was a man or a woman.  Fuuka showed no fear as she emerged from hiding and snarled at them.</p>
<p>“You’re the ones who are going  to regret it if you don’t surrender. You don’t even have a clue  as to what you’re up against!”</p>
<p>“This is your last warning!”  they shouted, approaching nearer. Athena smiled grimly.</p>
<p>“Funny, I was about to say the  same thing. Fuu-chan, go find someplace safe, and don’t come out  until I say so.”</p>
<p>“Try not to make too much of a  mess,” she moaned somberly. Fuuka knew only too well what Athena  was about to do, and she resigned herself to accepting its necessity.  It was either their lives, or the enemy’s. As she slipped back into  her room and locked the door, Athena’s eyes narrowed, and an  unquenchable fire burned right out of their orbs. A rage unlike  anything ever felt by mortal flesh overcame her, and nightmares  beyond reckoning spilled forth as she screamed bloody murder and  sailed into the mass, swinging her sword with abominable strength.  Flick— swish— thwack— she moved too fast to even see. Three  heads were chopped off with a single stroke; one body was cut from  shoulder to hip; legs and arms were hacked apart as she </p>
<p>flew into the wall, bounded off with  her powerful legs, dove into the air, and spun around like a blender,  slicing apart faces and craniums as she soared overhead.</p>
<p>Athena’s roar really intensified  as she bounced off the wall again and flew into the remnant, soaring  past the guns and the prods like a shark, her bite fatal and fast.  Blood poured out by the barrel; innards spewed like gruesome  fireworks; bones were hacked and mangled; limbs were crushed, ripped  off, and twisted beyond recognition. Whenever she hit a wall, she  simply thrust her legs and pushed herself back into the fray, an  invincible whirlwind of death and mayhem, slashing wildly until she  had amassed a grotesque pile of unfortunates. It took her the better  part of two minutes to calm her frenzy, to catch her breath, and to  wipe off the blood that had sprayed on her fur.</p>
<p>“Fuu-chan?” she said, turning to  their room. Instead of her lover waiting for her, however, she saw  another one of the figures, aiming a harpoon-gun at her. She froze,  not yet able to pounce since she was floating in midair, unable to  dodge or avoid the attack. She growled and held her ground, but was  startled when a loud CLANG silenced her attacker, sending him  groaning into unconsciousness. As he floated away, Athena’s heart  nearly burst as she saw her beloved standing there, bravely wielding  a frying pan.</p>
<p>“Fuu-chan!” Fuuka smiled at her  bashfully, her paws trembling.</p>
<p>“Just in time,” she gasped.  Before she could fly into Athena’s arms, however, a loud snap  surprised her, and Athena groaned quietly before drifting into the  cold. <em>Another</em> figure had snuck up and jabbed her with an  electric prod, and pushed the unresponsive Usagin out of the way as  they approached Fuuka, gingerly wading through the carnage. Fuuka  panicked, held her feeble weapon tight, and almost fainted out of  fear and exertion. Athena needed medical attention, but there was an  enemy between them, and Fuuka had tapped the last of her frail  strength just to beat that last one— and they would wake long  before Athena. She was completely trapped and helpless.</p>
<p>But something stirred inside that  gentle Kitsune’s heart, a meek, timid ember that had stoked all of  her passions and powers— that strength of will that made her  continue going on in spite of the odds and her impending doom. And  beyond that, imbedded into her DNA, was Animal Instinct in its  purest, most savage form: the strength of Kitsune warriors and their  Fox ancestors that had been accumulating over the years, just for  this moment, it seemed. Fuuka didn’t know what she was doing as she  leaped on the black-clad figure, snarling savagely, biting so hard  that she almost ripped his whole neck out, scratching deep gashes  that penetrated flesh and bone— she just knew she was fighting for  Athena’s sake, and that nothing— <em>nothing— NOTHING</em> was  going to beat her. The sight of blood dribbling down her jaw was not  nearly as frightening as the image of her lover, floating there in  oblivion, twitching slightly from the electric shock. Fuuka removed  her outer coat and wrapped the warrior with it, then hauled her back  to their room, locked the door, and put Morisato at her side as she  began administering to her wounds.</p>
<p>It was her turn to protect the one  she loved.</p>
<p>　</p>

<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Yes, I see. Thank you. I’ll do  that right away.” Astor hung up, stood, and addressed the remaining  three women in the room: Riene, Alala, and Iona. “There’s a  crisis aboard the station, and I’ve been called to attempt  negotiations. It’s a group calling themselves the ‘Hamaki na  Gerni,’ people’s liberated front of Gerni, and they’ve taken  over most of the station. Exits and entrances are blocked, all  communication to the outside is down, and there are even hostages.  This could be dangerous, so I want you two to stay here with Iona.”  Clarissa spoke with such commanding authority that it was difficult  to refuse; and the admiration of the two younger ladies spiked. Even  so, the Felinis have a very stubborn nature.</p>
<p>“We’re not exactly kittens here,  Director! We can help!”</p>
<p>“I know,” she said warmly. “Out  of all the people I know, you three may very well be able to turn the  tables. But I can’t risk it. I’m military personnel and you’re  not.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to negotiate,  let me assist you,” Riene offered. “I <em>do</em> speak most of the  galactic languages, and I’ve studied diplomacy extensively.”</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous,” Clarissa  stated sharply. Riene drew a stun gun she managed to smuggle through.</p>
<p>“I’ve also been to the firing  range. Don’t underestimate me, Director. I can be fierce if I have  to.”</p>
<p>“And I’ll be damned if ya leave  me behind!” Alala shrieked. Clarissa sighed, but one look from her  wife told her that she wouldn’t be winning this argument.</p>
<p>“I thank you,” she whispered.  “But don’t hold me responsible. Odds are that they’re after me  and will go to any lengths to achieve their goal. Let’s go.” Iona  quietly floated next to her wife, squeezing her hand as the four of  them made their way to the main pavilion. There were people covered  in black everywhere, but they were mainly concentrated at the  entrances and exits, and a circle had gathered around all the  hostages. As Clarissa identified herself, she was allowed to pass  through, and Riene was permitted to go as well, providing she leave  her weapon behind. Iona and Alala were left by themselves, which was  ultimately a bad idea. The Hamaki na Gerni would soon come to fear  the ancient Felinian proverb:</p>
<p>“Love us and you have a hundred  friends; scorn us and you make a thousand enemies.”</p>
<p>“Here I am!” Clarissa exclaimed  as she floated up to meet the leader of the Hamaki na Gerni. “I’m  the Director of the UCM, Clarissa Esriel Astor, and I have brought a  negotiator and interpreter to aid me. Her name is Riene Latoli, the  student of a friend of mine, and her words are as good as mine. Tell  me what I must do so that you will leave these people in peace.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, well,” the leader said,  brandishing a studded staff, “the rumors about you weren’t  exaggerated, Director. Bold, beautiful, and devoted to your ideals in  true militaristic fashion. Heheheh! You do realize that your life,  your friend’s life, and the lives of everyone in this station are  now the property of the Hamaki na Gerni, and we now have the right to  kill and save as we please!”</p>
<p>“Such folly leads to destruction,”  Astor warned. “Only God has the right to life and death.” The  leader chuckled, and slapped Astor, pushing her backwards until Riene  flew out and caught her.</p>
<p>“Keep spouting bullshit like that  and you’ll see just how godlike we can be! However, I like your  spunk, so I’ll pretend you didn’t insult us like that. Our  demands are quite simple, my lady. The Hamaki na Gerni requires a  vast sum of cash and military endorsement, and we’d like for you to  give us both. You know, make a friendly deal. Of course, we’ll also  have to take you into our custody so your friends don’t try  anything foolish, but don’t think of it as kidnapping. You’ll  just be…our esteemed guest and…personal protection.” Clarissa  closed her eyes and rubbed her stinging cheek, weighing his words  carefully. She had dealt with requests like this before, and although  she knew very little about the Gerni, she didn’t believe for a  second that she could rely on their word.</p>
<p>“Riene,” she said, “how would  you handle this situation?”</p>
<p>“I asked YOU, bitch!” The leader  smashed the butt of his staff in Clarissa’s solar plexus, causing  her to cough loudly and whirl away. Iona gnashed her teeth together  and clasped her hands, silently screaming for her love. When she  looked around, however, Alala was nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>“Tell me what the Hamaki na Gerni  movement is first,” Riene demanded. The leader glared at her,  shouldered his weapon, and grinned.</p>
<p>“You wanna be next? It doesn’t  bother me to hit girls, you know. Hell, I’d have you killed right  now if you weren’t so amusing.”</p>
<p>“Please,” she whispered. The  leader laughed out loud and put his weapon down. Clarissa slowly  recovered and was drawn back to face her adversary.</p>
<p>“They mostly smuggle contraband  supplies for several anonymous organizations,” she grunted.  “They’re more than likely demanding that we stop UCM  intervention, maybe even make their actions legal.”</p>
<p>“You’ve done your homework!”  he cackled, tapping Clarissa with the staff.</p>
<p>“Not really. A subordinate officer  merely ran into a convoy several months back. Her report was very  precise.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Brr,” Kaori shivered. Sati  raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Cold?”</p>
<p>“No, I just get the feeling that  somebody’s talking about me.”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” she squeaked, tilting her  head. “Aren’t you confusing that with something else? Don’t  your ears have to burn or something?” Kaori looked at her friend  incredulously.</p>
<p>“Are you saying <em>you</em> can’t  sense that? Something’s gone wrong.”</p>
<p>“Well, now that you mention it, my  nose <em>has</em> been acting up lately. And here I thought you had bad  taste in perfumes!”</p>
<p>“You can tease me later,” Kaori  stated as she made a beeline for her closet. Even though she was on  vacation, she still brought her Damascus suit with her, just in case  duty decided to call. “Right now I need your help. Can I count on  you?”</p>
<p>“Hey, you <em>know</em> I’m good  for it! All the time and every time! Ooh, nice outfit!”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she smiled. “A  friend gave it to me. Let’s roll.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Brr,” Eve shivered. Quincy  smiled and tickled her ear.</p>
<p>“What, is somebody walking over  your grave?”</p>
<p>“No, I just get the feeling that  somebody’s talking about me.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that when your ears burn?  Never mind. I want to hear what the Director is saying.”</p>
<p>“They’re not faring too well,  are they?” Eve glanced up as the two women continued negotiations  with the leader. After watching that animal hit the defenseless  Director twice, Eve’s fists balled and she swore to wreak nasty  vengeance the minute she was freed. The Jackal was as calm as ever,  although in reality, her mind was jumbled with schemes and plots.</p>
<p>“Relax,” she said, placing a  cold hand on Eve’s shoulder. “Your Quincy is more than just a  pretty face. I figured they’d do something like this. While the  goon squad was busy staring at the Director and their boss, I’ve  been sending a message to an old partner of mine. Just be prepared to  run when you see the signal.”</p>
<p>“Run? Signal?” Eve didn’t know  what the aptly-named Jackal had in mind, but she knew it wouldn’t  be pretty. She had no choice but to trust the older woman, and given  her record, that was much easier said than done.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Oh, gimme a break!” Yenae  groaned in exasperation. “I thought she was dead for three years  and all of a sudden, she comes back and tells me <em>that?</em> Psshh,  what a selfish little cunt! Always has been, always will be! I don’t  even know what I saw in her! Oh, fine, I’ll save your scrawny  little ass one more time, but you’d better be freaking grateful!”  She rubbed her horns and went looking for Alala, who had managed to  sneak away from Iona and perform some reconnaissance. Yenae saw a  familiar silvery tail flash by, and scurried over towards it.</p>
<p>“Hey!” she hissed. “Alala!  Over here! Turn this way! Psst!” The feisty catgirl heard her name  being called and scurried over, grimacing briefly as she discovered  who had summoned her. But this was no time for mistrust, so she put  her feelings aside.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got a plan to save the  day, and I’m going to need your help! We’ll make our way to the  station management room and flip the artificial gravity on. Lyara’s  going to link up with everybody telepathically, so we can coordinate  our attacks and get these losers out of here. I need you to help me  sneak in and hold the guards off.”</p>
<p>“Um, okay,” she replied  awkwardly. She wasn’t used to Yenae acting so…responsibly, and it  took her off guard. The mood was softened as Yenae giggled and licked  Alala’s cute pink nose.</p>
<p>“Ready to go kick ass, partner?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but you better watch out I  don’t kick yours first! Lead the way!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Regardless of how much you know  about our fine establishment,” the leader resumed, “it still  doesn’t change the fact that you’re still not agreeing to our  demands. I think I’ve been more than reasonable, and since you’re  in no position to bargain, it would be wise of you to just give in  and forget about this mess. Hell, I might even consider letting you  go, Miss Director, if you take off your clothes and lick the bottom  of my shoes!”</p>
<p>“That’s inhuman!” Riene  exclaimed, but Clairssa stopped her from lunging. She started to  unbutton her blazer and kicked off her shoes; they floated mindlessly  through the air.</p>
<p>“My pride isn’t nearly as  important as their lives, Riene. If this will honestly help them, I  don’t mind stooping to that level. I’m only one person, anyway;  it’s not as if it matters.”</p>
<p>“But you can’t,” she murmured.  Clarissa took her hosiery off next, and loosened her necktie. Before  she could remove her slacks, however, a voice called out to her, and  a tiny creature fluttered above, flailing her limbs wildly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, oh, listen to Riene, she’s  quite sharp, you know, for a human, and if it’s someone lowering  themselves that you want, Mr. Gerni leader, I’d be more than  willing to take her place, because I’m really more valuable than  she is, but listen to my proposition first, okay, I could pay you <em>ten  times</em> what the military has to offer, oh yes, quite easily, and  don’t you give me that look, Riene, it’s in my authority, or have  you forgotten I’m still carrying that note from the Vicegerent,  huh?”</p>
<p>No mistaking it: there was Vimmy,  flying above the leader’s head, wielding her treasured parchment.  Below, Mink lowered her head in humiliation.</p>
<p>“Oh, master Vimmy, how could you  make such a spectacle of yourself?”</p>
<p>“A Norgrim?” the leader  bellowed. Vimmy brandished her parchment and lifted her wig, tipping  it like a hat.</p>
<p>“Indeed, but normally I’d call  in our police and charge you for using that name, however, I’m  feeling generous, I’d really like your people to leave quickly and,  erm, painlessly, if possible, do you think it could be done, honestly  now, you can’t talk to humans, they’re not good with business,  but you can get a fair deal with me, I’ll treat you properly, and  maybe we can be friends.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be!” he exclaimed,  crossing his arms boldly. “An honest-to-goodness Norgrim! If I’d  known there was one of you aboard this flying trash pile, I wouldn’t  have gone to so much trouble with the Director! So you say you’ll  give me what I want?”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed, you can trust my  word, and my assistant is down there somewhere in the crowd, she’ll  help seal the deal, give your fellows the cash they need and the  freedom they deserve, I mean, what’s more important than  enterprising, and how cruel of the military to restrict you like  that, Ms. Astor ought to be ashamed.” The leader laughed  uproariously, but nobody else was in such a good mood. In fact, Riene  felt sick.</p>
<p>“I always knew that Vimmy would be  the end of us— someday, somehow.”</p>
<p>“You should put more faith in your  comrades,” Astor replied. She subtly gestured to the ground, where  Mink, Shana, Yenae, Alala, and Herut were slipping through the  crowds, completely undetected. “This is a situation only a Norgrim  could handle,” she continued, her voice firm and sure. “An  unscrupulous merchant such as Miss Fonester can turn the balance of  power faster than the entire military combined. Besides, even if she  really <em>is</em> betraying you, she’s also buying the others plenty  of time. Thank goodness they’re such a garrulous race.” Riene  hadn’t counted on that factor, but sure enough, Vimmy’s  chattering was giving the others time to act. Herut and Shana were  hacking into the revised computer programs and unlocking all the  blockades, while Mink was flitting around freeing the hostages little  by little. Yenae and Alala were heading to management, presumably to  take control of the space station, and people like Lil, Aseria,  Kyrie, and Naja were ready to fight their way to victory. Riene felt  hope flaring up, and whispered her thanks to the “annoying little  troll”.</p>
<p>“The bad news is,” she chuckled,  “we’ll never hear the end of it.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Kaori and Sati fought through  several waves of attackers as they made their way to the main  pavilion. They were alarmed to discover the whole station had been  taken over by terrorists, but they wasted no time and started to  “clean house”. Sati was definitely more experienced in actual  hand-to-hand combat, and she whirled her way through the opposition  like a leaf caught in a twister, taking advantage of the zero  gravity. Kaori wasn’t too shabby, but her real strength rested in  the Damascus suit, which boosted stamina and reflexes, and could  protect against mortal wounds, something even Sharyn’s Lesser Armor  couldn’t do.</p>
<p>They only stopped their assault out  of prudence. The pavilion was littered with people in black, far more  than they could ever hope to defeat by themselves, and there were  many hostages to consider as well, so for the moment, the two friends  hid themselves, uniting their minds to hatch a plan. The real trouble  rested on Yenae’s shoulders as she and Alala approached the  management room, which was protected by six of the black-clad  terrorists. Yenae quickly downed two of them with her knives, while  Alala sprang into action and took down three more. The last one was  crushed as Yenae jumped on his chest and twisted his neck; not a  single one had been given time to call for help.</p>
<p>“You know what to do!” Yenae  grinned, flashing a thumbs-up. Alala couldn’t help but feel elated  by her confidence and tenacity, and her trust in the mischievous  woman strengthened. She ran in first, leaping into the air and  kicking two of the black-clad people in the chin, then hid in the  ceiling pipes as they fired their stun-guns into the air. Yenae  swooped in, slashed their knees, and grabbed hold of the controls.  She glanced over to check up on the hostages, but they had been  killed: two men working at this station had their throats cut. She  grimaced in anger and resolved to avenge their loss; Alala,  meanwhile, was holding the rest of the guards off, fighting with the  strength of her ferocious ancestors as Yenae worked her magic.</p>
<p>“I hope I know what I’m doing!”  she exclaimed as she ignited the artificial gravity.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The effects were felt almost  instantly. To start off with, Vimmy plummeted straight onto the  terrorist leader’s face, which ultimately saved her life when he  came crashing down. The force of the fall broke his spine, and with  Vimmy lying on top, his skull was busted in (she would forever brag  about how she had heroically “vanquished” him). Clarissa and  Riene also fell, but Iona rushed in to catch her wife, and Lil caught  Riene in her arms. She grinned brightly as Riene hopped off, slightly  dizzy, and tried not to blush.</p>
<p>“Pretty lucky save!” she  cackled. “So doesn’t the hero get a kiss from the princess?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“She will if she acts heroically,”  Riene wheezed. She was quite disoriented from the sudden shift in  gravity, but managed to compose herself just in time to catch a  flying stun-gun.</p>
<p>“Astor!” Herut and Shana had  done their work well, and were throwing weapons to all their allies  scattered around. Astor wasted no time and jammed an electric prod  directly into the forehead of the nearest terrorist, blasting her  brain to bits. Iona was slightly more peaceful about it, and merely  shocked them in the stomach or the neck; Valti armed herself with six  prods, and laughed wickedly as she started to go on a rampage.</p>
<p>“Mwahahahahahaaaaa!! Run, run—  or you’ll be well done!!”</p>
<p>“She is having <em>way</em> too much  fun,” Shana sighed.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Kaori blinked and tried to sit up,  but something was weighing her down. She didn’t quite expect the  gravity to return, throwing everything into chaos, but she was glad  for the distraction, and if she could…just…move…then she would  be able to help in the fight. But something was on top of her, so  heavy that she could barely budge. It wasn’t her armor— that had  helped save her when everything came crashing down— but instead…</p>
<p>“Ooh, soft! Smells nice. Hey, I  was wrong about your choice in perfumes, Kaori-chan!”</p>
<p>“GET OFFA ME!!”</p>
<p>“Whoa!” Sati was thrown so far  that she crashed into one of the terrorists. Without thinking, she  sprang into action and broke his shoulder bones, then squirmed around  and kicked him in the guts, permanently erasing him from the fight.  Kaori limped out after her, glaring with dignity. Sati blushed and  apologized.</p>
<p>“No need, it was just an accident.  Uh— GET DOWN!!” Kaori whipped out a stun gun and shot the  attacker in the eye, then ran over to push her away. She quickly  whirled around, absorbing three prods as she clutched the  outstretched arms tightly, yanking her enemies out with a judo toss  and slamming them on the ground. In the distance, Kaori saw someone  wielding a blowtorch, cackling wildly as she set the unfortunate  black-clad figures on fire.</p>
<p>“This is a catastrophe!” she  exclaimed. Sati rubbed her head bashfully.</p>
<p>“They are getting a little out of  hand.”</p>
<p>Kyrie was the one with the torch,  naturally, but she didn’t mean to lose control. She had resisted  the terrorists from the start, and had been stuffed inside a storage  room for her efforts. Not one to be deterred, and wielding a secret  agent’s resourcefulness, she quickly constructed a torch out of the  materials she found and burned her way through the door’s hinges.  Of course, once she got going, it was impossible to stop, and she  kept burning and scaring people away as she ran </p>
<p>through the pavilion, laughing  wildly. Valti saw her, but decided it would be impossible to calm her  down.</p>
<p>“And to think you had sex with  that monster!” Riene sighed. Brignor chuckled.</p>
<p>“Oh, it wasn’t all bad.” Kyrie  eventually ran out of fuel, however, and her fire died down. Her  spirits remained as strong as ever, though, so when seven of the  infuriated terrorists surrounded her, each one wielding a melee  weapon, she grinned and flashed her claws.</p>
<p>“Who wants to be the first?” she  hissed. None of them were brave enough to charge the demonic  creature, so Kyrie struck first, tackling the nearest one and gouging  his eyes out. She jumped over a flying wrench, hovering with her  wings, and dove down to smash the head of another, crumpling his  spine like an accordion. She felt the icy kiss of a knife caress her  skin, and circled around with a renewed fury, slashing so hard that  the woman’s intestines leaked out. She head-butted the next one,  goring him with her horns, and finally lashed out and ripped a poor  girl’s mask and voice filter off with her teeth.</p>
<p>The entity was literally faceless.  She perished instantly, suffocating without her breathing device.</p>
<p>“AW, HELL NO!!” she roared.  “WHAT IN THE FREAKING FROZEN HELL WAS THAT!! He…she…it…there  wasn’t a face! They didn’t have a face!”</p>
<p>“That’s good to know,”  remarked the Acheron twins, who were running up to join the fight.  Kay had wanted to get the hostages to safety, while Tee insisted that  they start clobbering people. Since both mind shared only one body,  they were forced to come to a compromise, and flipped a coin to see  whose wish would be fulfilled first. Tee had won, but they both  stopped to check up on their comrade. “Are you okay? You’re  bleeding.”</p>
<p>“It’s their blood,” she said,  spitting out flecks of yellow and white (strangely, Pyrosians do not  have red blood; theirs is pallid).</p>
<p>“Well, if you can stand, I suppose  you’re okay. Could you do us a favor and help the hostages?”</p>
<p>“No, I think she should fight with  us. Did you see the way she handled those others? Kyrie can really  kick ass!”</p>
<p>“Um, thanks, you two, but this is  kinda confusing…”</p>
<p>“Well <em>somebody</em> has to help  all those people! Admit it, you wouldn’t stop bitching if I had won  that toss! At least I’m not complaining.”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t pretend you don’t  like cracking skulls, Kayleigh! You’ve been itching for a good  brawl ever since we took out that monster together! Remember, Kyrie?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but we’re kinda wasting  time here…”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The needs and lives of the  civilians are more important than your…war-lust!”</p>
<p>“I thought you weren’t <em>going</em> to complain!”</p>
<p>“I’m not! I’m just saying that  we can’t ALL play the warrior here! Who’s going to protect those  people from all the strays?”</p>
<p>“Guys, really, I don’t mind  doing it if you’re going to argue like that…”</p>
<p>“That’s what the police are for!  You saw all those UCM suits wandering around! Besides, who’s to say  that one of our crew isn’t helping them?”</p>
<p>“I’d just rather be safe than  sorry, is all.”</p>
<p>“KATIE!!” The Acheron sisters  froze and glared at Kyrie hatefully. Nobody had ever fused their  names together like that and walked away from it.</p>
<p>“Oh, you didn’t. You’re in for  it now, Red! Prepare to be the last Lastgear ever!”</p>
<p>“Oh for heaven’s sake, Teleah,  is that your idea of a joke?! If you’re going to break the poor  girl’s skull, you could at least come up with a better line!”</p>
<p>“Oh? What do you have in mind,  hotshot?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah,” Kyrie whimpered, “I  think I’ll just leave you two in peace.” She shuddered and  scampered away quickly. Luckily, the sisters stopped bickering long  enough to notice she was gone, and that there was a battle still  going on. They put their enormous differences aside and went back  into the fray, a two-headed warrior-goddess that quickly became the  bane of the Gerni.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>With the entire crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> working together, they were able to kill, disable,  or route most of the terrorists, and guided the hostages and  civilians to a safe place, where Lil and Aseria stood their ground  with Naja as a last line of defense. While things were slowly  beginning to settle down outside, the wildest members of the crew got  to see some last-minute action as a swarm of dark-robed enemies came  their way, loaded for bear. Aseria held her palms out and began  whispering a spell, but Naja stopped her.</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s been too long since  I’ve had a good fight, so you just leave these fools to me! I don’t  give a rat’s ass about those people back there, but if one of these  fuckers slip through, don’t let them get any nearer! Time for Naja  to undergo some stress management!!”</p>
<p>“Heaven help them,” Aseria  gestured, crossing herself sarcastically as Naja cracked her  knuckles. The abilities of the Elshyrin are legendary, and Naja was  one of the roughest ever borne from that pit of vipers. She waited  until all fifteen of the enemy had come out to face her, </p>
<p>clutching their weapons nervously.  She made sure to give them a great, poisonous smile before leaping  into battle.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the enemies drew first  blood, plunging a dagger into Naja’s scaly skin. The knife went in  all the way to the hilt, but Naja completely shrugged it off and  slammed her palms on the woman’s head, cracking her skull like an  egg. She lifted the body and used it as a shield, sweeping her legs  underneath to smash her enemies’ knees, then tossed the headless  corpse into their midst, leaping after it as she brandished iron  fingers and deadly teeth. She sunk herself deep into the nearest man,  digging her hands into his body until they passed out his back, then  charged after another and punched her fist right through his mouth,  caving his teeth in and breaking his jaw. A second punch ruptured his  windpipe; she threw her second human shield away, lashed out to  shatter a woman’s ribcage, and jumped after her, digging her feet  into her chest.</p>
<p>It wasn’t as if she was invincible  or impervious to attack. Naja was cut, stabbed, punctured, slashed,  beaten, thrown, and even shot with an electric prod. That last attack  actually slowed her down, but in respect, she had slaughtered all but  three of the enemies, and the remaining few were mortally frightened.  She squirmed and convulsed on the floor, trying to hoard her wits and  willpower, but even Naja had her limits; she had used a lot of energy  in the fight, and was now bleeding in several places. Lil stepped in  to take over, but with a sudden burst of defiant strength, Naja  dismissed her.</p>
<p>“Stay the fuck out!” she  groaned, her voice and movements now distorted. Slowly, the  serpentine woman slithered to her feet, staggering and limping  weakly. That shock certainly did a number on her body, but she was  just stubborn enough to see the rest of the battle through. One of  the women ran screaming, while the others charged after her. She  grabbed one and bit him in the neck, injecting her venom and killing  him instantly, then snapped out at the last, grabbing her by the leg.  With the last bit of her strength, Naja ripped the limb off, and dove  after the doomed terrorist, launching her elbow into the base of her  skull, and there was where she rested.</p>
<p>“Holy shit,” Lil whispered in  awe. “Remind me never to piss <em>you</em> off!” Aseria knelt down  and began weaving Sindarin healing magic over her wounds, smiling in  gratitude.</p>

<p>Needless to say, there was a lot of  cleaning up to do once the last of the Hamaki na Gerni was accounted  for, but many heroes were praised and rewards were given out. The  Director and her wife didn’t stay very long, wanting to avoid a  public spectacle, but everyone else decided to remain for another day  and rest up. That night they spent was particularly memorable for  some people: for one, Alala talked to Yenae about the offer that  Clarissa had made her, and after nearly squeezing the life out of the  silver-haired Felinis, Yenae gave her unconditional support, and even  swore that, should Alala get the position, she would be more than  happy to act as her right-hand officer.</p>

<p>She also suggested they share the  same bed. This was promptly rejected.</p>

<p>Quincy Winchester was paid the most  for her services, and was finally able to treat Eve to a day at the  spa. Later, they were seen walking into the same hotel room, and were  not seen again until the afternoon of the following day. Mink watched  their actions stoically, and if she ever did show any emotion, it was  doubt: was Eve merely throwing herself at this suitor out of  desperation, or was there a real connection between the two? That  seemed highly unlikely…but who was she to judge? She returned to  the astronomy lesson Shana was giving her, and gave the petite lady  her brightest smile when their eyes met. Shana blushed, but didn’t  dare look away: her expression was so sweet and sincere.</p>
<p><em>I’m so unsure of myself,</em> she sighed mentally. <em>There’s Herut, and then there’s Mink. I  wish I were more experienced— then I would know for sure. For right  now…</em></p>
<p>She held Mink’s hand and snuck a  quick kiss before peering into the telescope. Mink’s grey skin  turned rosy, and she pressed her lips against Shana’s forehead,  feeling true love finally crawling out of hiding. Suing had but to  tilt her head a little, and all of her questions would be cleared, or  so she believed. She tried it and, as sweet a sensation it was, still  felt lost. Oh well.</p>
