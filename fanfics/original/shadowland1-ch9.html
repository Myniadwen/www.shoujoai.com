Deadly Eyes

It was a night and a twelve-year-old Kimberly stumbled around the city 
in her nightgown. She was lost, alone and very much afraid. She wanted 
nothing more then to be with Natalie and her mother, however she knew 
that was impossible and she really didn&#39;t want to think about that. She 
shivered in the cold until she found an old dissolute playground and sat 
on one of the swings, wrapping her arms around her body to keep warm, 
trying hard not to cry. 

&quot;Hello?&quot; A soft child&#39;s voice said from behind her. 

Kimberly glanced around to see another girl about the same age as her, 
however much shorter. The little girl had soft greyish hair and a 
slightly boiish face if it wasn&#39;t for the girl&#39;s voice and the pink 
overalls that were cut into shorts Kim would have mistaken her for a 
boy. Kim simply stared at the girl and blinked, trying hard not to let 
her tears show.

&quot;My name is Lauren. What is yours?&quot; The girl asked curiously, with a 
smile.

Kimberly glanced around to see if the girl was really talking to her. 
When she was certain that they were the only others one in the park she 
spoke, &quot;Ki... Kimberly, but everyone calls me Kim.&quot; she answered 
quietly.

&quot;Kiiimm!!! What a nice name.&quot; Lauren cocked her head sideways, &quot;Are you 
alone?&quot;

Kim looked at the ground, &quot;I... I&#39;m lost.&quot; She stated with despair in 
her voice.

Lauren crouched so she could gaze up into Kimberly&#39;s face. &quot;I&#39;m on my 
own too. You want to come with me? Then neither of us will be alone.&quot; 
Kimberly blinked at the girl in confusion. Natalie was the only person 
who ever tried to be friends with her before, but the way the girl 
smiled at her made Kim feel she could trust this girl. Lauren stood and 
held out a hand. &quot;Come on. I know where there&#39;s a warm place to stay the 
night.&#148; She offered a hand to Kim, &#147;You&#39;ll be safe with me. I&#39;ll protect 
you.&quot; Kimberly cautiously and took the girl&#39;s hand and was instantly 
pulled into the night. 

                             *****

Kimberly rubbed her eyes and felt a stabbing ache run through her body. 
She sat up quickly grabbing her shoulder, biting back the pain, 
&quot;Nnnnnn!!!&quot; She struggled against the scream that wanted to burst forth. 

&quot;HEY!! Don&#39;t do that!!&quot; Jenn yelled out as she forced the girl to lie 
down again.

Slowly Kim opened her eyes and looked around, &quot;Where am I?&quot; She inquired 
through the haze of pain. 

&quot;The nurse&#39;s office.&quot; Jenn kept her voice low as she sat down on a chair 
next to the bed, &quot;I told the nurse that you slipped and fell and I think 
she believed me.&#148; She explained quickly then set her worried eyes upon 
the girl, &#147;You&#39;ve been asleep for over an hour now. How do you feel?&quot;

Kimberly glanced down at the bandages and self-consciously pulled the 
blankets over her body, &quot;H...have y... you been watching over me the 
entire time?&quot; She inquired embarrassed that a girl had been looking at 
her practically nude body.  

&quot;I...&quot; A flush covered Jenn&#39;s face, &quot;I couldn&#39;t just leave you here not 
knowing if you would ever wake up. I didn&#39;t want you waking up alone not 
knowing where you were.&quot; She gave Kimberly a weak smile, &quot; Besides, it 
gave me an excuse to skip class.&quot; She began to reach into her bag, &quot;By 
the way, have you eaten? I still have some lunch if you want some.&quot; She 
pulled out a sandwich.

&quot;Why? Why are you helping me?&quot; Kimberly asked confused by Jenn&#146;s 
presence, &quot;I guess you&#39;ve seen my arms and...&quot; She wrapped her arms 
around her waist and trembled. 

Jenn leaned back in the chair and gazed up at the ceiling, &quot;If I told 
you it was because I hate math, would you believe me?&quot; She glanced at 
Kimberly who gave her a weird look, &quot;No, I guessed not.&quot; She leaned 
forwards in the chair setting her elbows on the bed. &quot;Let&#39;s just say 
that you remind me of someone.&quot; She smiled at Kimberly who just stared 
back at her. Jenn handed the girl a piece of her sandwich. &quot;Here, eat 
up. I have to get to my last class, but I&#39;ll be back soon enough, &#39;kay?&quot;

Kimberly gingerly took the sandwich from the girl and slowly nodded. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be back in a hour or so...&quot; Jenn assured with a smile as she stood 
up and prepared to leave, &quot;You&#39;ll see: The time will fly by so fast you 
won&#39;t even notice that I&#39;m gone. Oh and here is a new shirt and blazer 
for you.&quot; She pulled the shirt off the back of the chair she sat in, 
&#147;The school always keeps some spares in the gym in case something 
happens.&#148; She explained, handing the clothes over to Kim. 

Kim took the shirt and glanced up at Jenn peculiarly, &quot;Promise?&quot; 
Kimberly whispered.

Kimberly&#39;s eyes looked fragile as glass and made Jenn want to reach out 
to take the girl in her arms and hold her &quot;I promise.&quot; Jenn reassured 
and reach out to ran a hand through the girl&#39;s red hair. 

Kim was surprised that she didn&#146;t pull back for the first time in years. 
The feeling of Jenn&#146;s fingers caused her to shiver, and then Jenn 
quickly turned and ran out of the room. Kim stared at the chair in which 
Jenn had been sitting only moments ago and down at the shirt she held in 
her hands. She raised the shirt to her nose and inhaled the smell. She 
stopped herself and blinked at the shirt. She pulled the blankets over 
her head and buried her face in the pillow, letting out a deep pained 
sob.

*****

The time did not &#39;fly by&#39; for Jenn as fast as she would have liked it 
to. It was pure torture having to sit in class and listen to the 
teachers go on and on about things she already knew. She could not keep 
her mind off of Kimberly, her soft red hair, those oddly beautiful eyes 
and small breasts. She shook her head trying to clear the thoughts that 
threatened to invade her mind. She scanned the class and wondered how 
many of the girls around her were thinking the same as she was, dreaming 
about the softness of a girl&#39;s kiss. One of the girls noticed that Jenn 
was looking at her and Jenn gave a small wave, causing the girl to blush 
and quickly turn away.

Usually she would play along with the game but now... now her heart 
ached the more she thought about Kimberly&#39;s sad eyes. This was the first 
time she felt so close to someone that she didn&#39;t even know. She wished 
there was something she could do to take the girl&#39;s pain away when she 
was startled by the bell announcing the end of the day. 

Slowly, she got up and stretched when someone tapped her on the 
shoulder, &quot;So where have you been all afternoon?&quot; came the sound of 
May&#39;s annoyed voice.

&quot;May, I don&#39;t have time right now.&quot; Jenn returned with equal annoyance 
in her own voice, &quot;Could we leave this for another day? I&#39;m tired.&quot; She 
grabbed her bag and stuffed her notebook into it, then prepared to 
leave. 

&quot;Did you have fun with that girl?&quot; May demanded coldly as Jenn headed 
out of the class. 

Jenn turned to glare at May, &quot;This has nothing to do with her and you 
know it, so leave her alone.&quot; She was now beyond annoyed with May&#39;s 
attitude and if the girl did not drop things Jenn was afraid she was 
going to snap. 

&quot;Did you know she&#39;s been kicked out of four schools in the past two 
years? Seems she has quite the reputation for being a psycho.&quot; May 
remarked with a smirk, proud of her investigation skills.

Jenn stepped up close to May and gazed her in the eye, &quot;I&#39;m getting 
tired of your garbage, May. Kimberly has never done anything to you so 
why don&#39;t you leave her alone.&quot; Jenn requested through clenched teeth, 
trying hard to keep herself from showing how angry she was getting with 
the girl.

May was finding it hard to look Jenn directly in the eyes, but could not 
avoid Jenn&#39;s gaze,  &quot;She&#39;s... She&#39;s weird and I don&#39;t understand what 
you could possibly see in her.&quot; May retorted, covering up just how much 
Jenn&#39;s gaze was affecting her. &quot;I always knew you were strange, but come 
on Je-&quot; Jenn slammed her hand on the desk, startling everyone in the 
room and even making May jump out of her skin.

&quot;That is enough out of your mouth.&quot; Jenn snarled. She was seriously 
angry now, which was rare, so everyone listened, &quot;I don&#39;t know what your 
problem is lately, but I&#39;ve just about had it from you.&#148; Her voice rose 
to a roar, &#147;You&#146;re always getting in my way and butting into my 
business. So why don&#39;t you shut the hell up for a change?! And leave me 
alone, Alright!?&quot; Jenn turned away and stormed out of the class. 

As Jenn stomped down the hall with her hands in her arms, crossed before 
her chest. She noticed Kris leaning against the far wall with her eyes 
closed. The girl opened one eye and looked up as Jenn approached her, 
&quot;May bothering you again, is she?&quot; Kris inquired casually. 

Jenn did not slow her pace as she passed her friend, Kris quickly 
pushing off the wall and following close beside her. &quot;She&#39;s beginning to 
really piss me off with her attitude problem.&#148; Jenn seethed, &#147;I wish she 
would stop with the games for once.&quot; She remarked, rubbing her hand, 
which was now red from hitting the desk. 

Kris thought to herself and when she spoke her voice was very calm, 
&quot;Well sometimes it&#39;s not that easy for some. You&#39;ve both changed a lot 
since getting here and I think she feels like she&#39;s losing a friend.&quot;					

&quot;You sound like you&#39;re talking from experience.&quot; Jenn glanced over at 
her friend curiously.

Kris gazed out of the windows that ran along one side of the hall, &quot;You 
could say I&#39;ve lost a few friends.&quot; She fell was silent for a moment 
then spun around to face Jenn again, &quot;Oh! You still up for tonight?&quot; She 
inquired, that warm smile that Jenn had grown accustom to upon her face. 

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be renting some movies along the way home.&quot; Jenn returned 
the smile. 

&quot;Something R-rated?&quot; Kris suggested eagerly, while winking and poking 
Jenn in the side with her elbow, causing the girl to break out into 
laughter. 

&quot;Stop it, Kris, or I&#39;ll have to hurt you.&quot; Jenn laughed. 

&quot;Like you could.&quot; Kris pushed Jenn up against a wall and held the girl&#39;s 
arms over her head with one hand. Jenn blushed as she looked up into her 
friend&#39;s eyes. &quot;What you going to do now miss &#39;I&#39;ll kick your butt&#39;?&quot; A 
smile played across Kris&#39;s face and she placed her free hand under 
Jenn&#39;s chin so she could not break away from her gaze. Jenn always felt 
a weakness to those eyes and right now she was sure she had lost.

&quot;Kris...&quot; Jenn was lost for words. She wished that for once Kris was 
being serious. Her eyes fell to the girl&#146;s lips and could feel a hunger 
growing in side of her, wanting nothing more then a chance for a taste. 
She licked at her own lips and quivered in anticipation. 

Giggles could be heard from down the hall and Kris noticed they were 
being watched by a couple of girls and let Jenn go. The girls giggled 
and whispered to each other some more as they stared at Kris and Jenn, 
before they ran away. 

Jenn let out a sigh of relief, &quot;For a second there I thought you were 
serious.&quot; She was not sure what she would have done if Kris had really 
kissed her. She forced the hunger deep inside and locked it away. Not 
wanting to deal with it at that time.

&quot;I was just teasing you.&quot; Kris laughed.

&quot;And do you &#39;tease&#39; all the girls like that?&quot; Jenn glanced at Kris 
curiously.

Kris turned her back to the girl, &quot;Nope, you&#39;re the only lucky one.&quot; She 
stated as she started down the hall, then turned back around and gazed 
at Jenn, &quot;I just realized something. Why are we going this way when the 
exit is that way?&quot; She inquired; poking down the hall in the opposite 
way they had come. 

Jenn moved passed her friend, &quot;Because there&#39;s someone I promised I 
would see when school let out.&quot; She replied simply.

Kris quickened her pace so she could peer in Jenn&#146;s eyes, &quot;It&#39;s that new 
girl, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She remarked with a grin.

Jenn blushed a deep red. 

&quot;I should have guessed you had a weak spot for redheads.&quot; Kris&#146;s grin 
broadened.

&quot;It&#39;s not like that!&quot; Jenn retorted defensively. 

Kris stopped smiling, &quot;She reminds you of yourself, doesn&#39;t she?&quot; She 
remarked seriously.

Jenn was shocked by what Kris said, &quot;Ho... how&#39;d you know that?&quot; She 
stammered nervously.

&quot;I can see it in your eyes.&quot; Kris turned away from her friend. 

&quot;Kris?&quot; Jenn stopped in her tracks and stared at Kris&#146;s back as she 
walked away from her. 

Kris stopped and let out a sigh before turning around to face her 
friend, &quot;Come on now;&quot; Kris gave a smile at the girl, &quot;You don&#39;t want to 
leave your girl waiting now, do you?&quot;

Jenn slowly shook her head and rushed to Kris&#146;s side. The two of them 
walked in silence down the long hall. Jenn thought for certain that she 
saw a glimmer of pain in Kris&#146;s eyes just a moment ago, almost like the 
other day, but could not think of how to bring it up. Before long they 
arrived at the nurses office and Jenn pushed her thoughts to the side as 
they open the door

The nurse turned to glance at the two girls as they entered the office 
and smiled at Jenn, &quot;Well, hello again. Your friend has been asking for 
you since the bell rang.&quot;

&quot;How is she doing?&quot; Jenn inquired, concerned and somewhat nervous.

&quot;Hmmmm...&quot; The nurse tapped her pencil against her lip, &quot;Well, you were 
right, it was only a scratch, which is odd because I remember it being 
much worse when you first walked in. But now...&quot; She lost herself in her 
thoughts. 

&quot;Ummm,&quot; Jenn nervously stood on one foot then another. She was hoping 
that the nurse had not caught onto her little lie, however it made no 
sense, the nurse should have noticed the large bandages and blood 
everywhere. Things were beginning to lose their rationality and Jenn was 
finding it hard to clear her head of the disorganization. It felt to 
Jenn like someone was playing with her world and this was only the 
beginning. She almost feared what the rest of the day would hold, when 
Kris&#146;s voice pulled her from her thoughts. 

&quot;What happened? You weren&#39;t hurt, were you?&quot; Kris asked there was a note 
of concern in her voice. 

&quot;No, I&#39;m just fine; Kimberly just fell down.&quot; Jenn tried to convince 
herself that she was not lying to the one person she didn&#39;t like to lie 
to. 

Kris looked Jenn in the eye, &quot;I see.&quot; was all she said. Jenn could tell 
her friend didn&#39;t believe her, but knew that Kris would not confront her 
on it right away. 

The nurse turned back to Jenn, &quot;That reminds me, I couldn&#39;t get an 
answer from Kimberly&#39;s father at work or home, so could you make sure 
she gets home safe and sound?&quot; She gave Jenn a warm smile. 

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Jenn took this chance to avoid Kris&#39;s gaze and turned back 
to the nurse, &quot;I should go see her now.&quot; She then slipped behind the 
curtain with Kris following closely behind. 

&quot;You going to explain, or do I have to force it out of you?&quot; Kris 
whispered into Jenn&#39;s ear.

&quot;I&#39;ll explain later tonight, alright?&quot; Jenn was not sure how she was 
going to explain what happened because she was still trying to sort it 
all out herself, and she didn&#39;t think Kris would believe her even if she 
did tell the truth. 

&quot;Fine, you owe me an explanation, or I will tickle it out of you 
tonight.&quot; Kris grinned maniacally. 

Something about when Kris smiled like that always tickled Jenn funny. 
She supposed the grin was supposed to look frightening, however to her 
it looked sillier. Jenn tried hard not to laugh as she turned to find 
Kim not in her bed.

They found the redhead standing at the window gazing out at the blue 
sky, now wearing the shirt that Jenn had found her. She turned when she 
heard their voices and a small smile broke out across her face, &quot;I was 
beginning to think you were another dream.&quot; She said softly.

&quot;Nope,&quot; Jenn smiled back at the girl, &quot;I&#39;m very real and so is this pest 
here.&quot; Pointing at Kris, &quot;Kimberly, this is my best friend Kris. Kris, 
this is Kimberly.&quot;

Kris took a deep bow, with one hand across her waist and the other off 
to the side in a gentlemanly manner, &quot;Pleasure to finally meet you, Lady 
Kimberly&quot; She then took Kim&#39;s hand and placed a light kiss upon the back 
of the girl&#39;s hand.

&quot;Ummm...You... you can call me Kim.&quot; Kim stammered as a light blush 
crossed her cheeks.

&quot;Kim it is, then.&quot; Kris said as she straightened up and gave the girl a 
smile that made her blush deepen.

 &quot;Are all the girls in this school like you two?&quot; Kim asked, a slightly 
flustered by the idea and glancing between Jenn and Kris.

&quot;I sure hope not!&quot; Kris said sounding a little worried. &quot;There are 
already enough problems with just this one around.&quot; She said as she 
ruffled Jenn&#39;s hair.

&quot;Hey, will you cut it out?&quot; Jenn hit Kris&#39;s hand away and fixed her 
hair, &quot;I&#39;m not the one who keeps kissing girl&#39;s hands now, am I?&quot; She 
said with a sneer. 

&quot;Ummm...&quot; Kimberly tried hard not to laugh then glanced at Jenn, &quot;Thank 
you for finding me a spare shirt and for staying with me and...&quot; She 
stammered

Jenn stepped closer to Kim and set her forehead on the girl&#39;s while 
looking her in the eyes, &quot;No problem.&quot; She said softly, not letting go 
of Kim&#39;s eyes, &quot;Don&#39;t worry too much about it. Like I said, you can 
trust me with your life, and that goes the same for Kris too.&quot; Kim felt 
her entire body flush. 

Kris watched the two girls with a broad smile on her face, &quot;Well, come 
on girls. We don&#39;t want them to force us to stay overnight now do we?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m getting tired.&quot; Jenn pulled herself away from Kim, &quot;I&#39;m so 
happy that it&#39;s Friday.&quot; The group of girls started on their way out of 
the school.

The three of them walked side by side as they set out into the autumn 
air. Kimberly tried to keep up as Kris told tales about life at an all 
girls&#146; school, from tales about club activities to tales about their 
adventures at and outside of the school.

 &quot;Once there were so many girls trying to talk to Jenn that she locked 
herself in the girls&#146; washroom, not wanting to come out.&quot; Kris laughed. 
&quot;She was so cute when she arrived at the school. I knew right away that 
she would be a challenge to my spot as top girl in school. Just didn&#39;t 
think it would only take two months.&quot;

Jenn reddened and glanced from Kim to Kris and back to Kim. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
don&#39;t listen to her. She doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s talking about.&quot; She 
said to Kim. 

&quot;Don&#39;t be modest.&quot; Kris&#39;s grin broadened, &quot;It only makes you cuter when 
you try to deny it.&quot; She laughed more. 

&quot;KRIS!!&quot; Jenn growled at her friend. 

Kris stopped laughing and noticed that Kim also was bright red and 
staring intensely at the ground. Kris scratched the back of her head, 
finally realizing that maybe she had said too much after all, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to embarrass the two of you.&quot;

&quot;Yes you did!&quot; Jenn glared at Kris, &quot;Anyways, don&#39;t you have somewhere 
you need to be?&quot;

&quot;Somewhere?&quot; Kris blinked.

Jenn shook her head in disappointment, &quot;You were so busy talking that 
you didn&#39;t notice we passed your turn. Aren&#39;t you going to be late for 
Cram Classes?&quot; Jenn said.

Kris scanned her surroundings, &quot;Well what do you know...&quot; She laughed to 
herself while scratching the back of her head, &quot;Well, I&#39;d better get 
going.&quot; She turned to Kim. &quot;It was nice meeting you. I&#39;m sorry if I made 
you feel uncomfortable. I&#39;m usually very kind and charming.&quot; She glared 
at Jenn, who stifled a laugh, then turned back to Kim. &quot;I hope to see 
more of you.&quot; She finished with a smile. 

Kim slowly nodded, still blushing. 

Kris started to jog backwards. &quot;Jenn, I&#39;ll see you later tonight. I&#39;m 
looking forward to spending the weekend with you.&quot; She waved, then 
turned around and ran down the street. 

Jenn waved back at her friend, watching the girl disappear around a 
corner, she spoke as she did so, &quot;I&#39;m sorry about my friend. She&#39;s 
usually not like that.&quot; She turned to look at Kim. The redhead&#39;s eyes 
were wide as if she has just seen a ghost. She started to sway and Jenn 
caught the girl as she began to fall. &quot;KIM! KIM! What&#39;s wrong?!?&quot; She 
glanced around and frantically called out to anyone who would listen, 
&quot;Help, HELP!!! ANYBODY!!!&quot;
