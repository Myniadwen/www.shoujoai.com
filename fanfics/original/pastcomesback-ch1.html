<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 1 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      Tsuru never really took herself for an idiot, but sometimes... sometimes, she wondered 
why she let this happen to her. Maybe it was the eye patch? Yep, it was definitely the eye 
patch. Purposefully handicapping yourself seemed cool, especially since pirates did it all 
the time and it gave you night vision and made training more challenging-

      Regardless, that had to be it - covering her right eye wasn&#39;t so great. Or was it the 
oversized sword? That might be it - oh yeah, she used TWO swords, so that could be it. One 
oversized, eye sore of an ethereal light blue blade and then a nice, elegant black bladed 
katana. It sounded cool and all, plus it made her a better fighter. You know, dual wielding 
and all that jazz.

      Perhaps it was her outfit? Her black, almost military like uniform was pretty and 
sharp looking, but was it really the best for fighting? It was made out of a protective, 
magical fabric. Magical. So maybe it wasn&#39;t the uniform... but still...

      Tsuru would have continued along her list of faults, but she was kind of busy with the 
Godzilla look alike demon in front of her. She was a traveling... mercenary of sorts and the 
nasty, big, black dragon thing decided it wanted to attack the place she was currently 
staying at.

      She dodged a swipe of its claws and swung the huge sword in her right hand. The dragon 
let out a cry and she had to use both blades to save herself from the lash of its tail. She 
was still flung out across the ground and the thing was writhing in pain. She could kill it, 
no problem. Well not &#39;no problem&#39;, but she could do it.

      Tsuru got up and prepared herself. She&#39;d already distracted and led the dragon away 
from innocent people nearby, so now it would be easy to take down. When it swung, Tsuru 
jumped onto its hand, using that at as leverage to go up its arm. Before it could fling her 
away again, she launched herself at its chest, delivering a crushing strike with her 
broadsword and a deeper slice with her katana.

      Do dragons scream? Tsuru smiled to herself as the beast let out a cry of agony. Heck, 
maybe it should have thought twice about attacking innocent people. &quot;What a stupid demon,&quot; 
she murmured, wiping her blades in the grass.

      Just as she was about to leave, the dragon rose back up. Tsuru didn&#39;t have time to 
redraw her weapons as it breathed fire from its massive mouth. &quot;Ah, sh-&quot;

      The flames engulfed her, but it wasn&#39;t hot. Not at all... instead... Tsuru found 
herself sitting on her butt with another figure in front of her. The flames had dispersed 
and the figure held out their longsword to the dragon.

      &quot;Another shadow beast? That&#39;s the fifth this month,&quot; the figure murmured. Tsuru 
scrambled to her feet as the dragon reared up for another attack. A shadow beast? Tsuru was 
a master of swords, not of magic, so-

      Her dilemma of how to kill the dragon was answered as soon as her savior swung and 
sent a wave of energy at the dragon. Tsuru was disappointed to see it die after that one 
hit.

      &quot;Whew,&quot; her hero said. &quot;That wasn&#39;t so bad.&quot;

      Tsuru watched as the young woman ruffled her shoulder length blonde hair and 
stretched. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

      She nodded dumbly at the blonde - scratch that, very cute blonde. Tsuru felt super 
dorky at the moment, wearing her fighting outfit, eyepatch and having her swords out. Maybe 
it didn&#39;t help that her hair was up in a ponytail and a bluish white. God, she probably 
looked like a freak.

      The young woman looked like she was going to say something, but she suddenly whirled 
around, as though concentrating on something. Tsuru looked around and felt a familiar shiver 
down her back. The presence reminded her of someone she ran into a long time ago, but-

      &quot;Watch out!&quot; Tsuru really didn&#39;t mind having cute girls launch themselves at her, not 
at all. She could have died of happiness in then girl&#39;s embrace, even with the maelstrom of 
dark energy heading right at them. So Tsuru did just that. 

***** 

      She didn&#39;t die, per se, but waking up to the cute girl&#39;s face was like heaven. Granted 
she could only see it from one eye. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re awake. We got knocked to part of a forest 
nearby, but whatever did that is gone.&quot;

      Tsuru was helped up to her feet and sighed at the loss of the young woman&#39;s hand. So 
she was love-struck. It happens, right? Her blonde beauty turned away to check her cell 
phone as Tsuru secretly admired her. How long was it since she last-

      Okay, maybe she should stop that train of thought. One, it was wrong to think of a 
girl like that, without even knowing what she was like and two, the last girl she was with. 
She shuddered and resisted the urge to gag. Her last and possible greatest experience in bed 
had to have been with one of the people she hated most in the world.

      She peered over to see the young woman become frustrated with her phone. &quot;Is there no 
signal,&quot; Tsuru asked and the girl nodded. &quot;Yeah, I was hoping to call my,&quot; She stopped and 
tried to search for the right words.

      &quot;Your boyfriend?&quot; Tsuru said, with a friendly tone. Might as well find out and get her 
hopes crushed early.

      &quot;Um, not... not a boyfriend,&quot; she said, blushing. She was smiling. &quot;It&#39;s just not a 
boy, if you kind of...&quot;

      Tsuru nodded. &quot;Oh yeah? Haha, me too. I mean, I&#39;m single, err, I meant that I don&#39;t 
like boys either. Not that I despise the male race-&quot;

      The blonde laughed at her rambling. &quot;You&#39;re a lesbian too?&quot; Tsuru nodded and smiled. 
The young woman continued her musings. &quot;It&#39;s really so strange - even though we&#39;re supposed 
to be a minority, I always run into such pretty girls who are that way...&quot;

      It would forever be a mystery.

      However, Tsuru was just happy to have been called pretty. &quot;Come on,&quot; the light blue 
haired girl said. &quot;We should get out of here before anything happens.&quot; The other woman 
nodded and they started walking down the path.

      Just Tsuru&#39;s luck to run into a pretty, nice girl that&#39;s a lesbian... only to find out 
she&#39;s taken. Lovely. Just lovely.

      &quot;So, what do you do?&quot; Tsuru looked over to see Krystal looking at her get-up.

      &quot;Ah, well, I&#39;m kind of a mercenary... my eye got injured in a battle when I was young 
girl,&quot; Tsuru said, noticing the other woman&#39;s gaze on her eye patch.

      &quot;Sorry, didn&#39;t mean to stare like that.&quot;

      &quot;Huh, oh it&#39;s fine. I can see perfectly, but I don&#39;t like uncovering it... bad 
memories. I used to be an exorcist as well.&quot; The young woman seemed surprised by Tsuru&#39;s 
words.

      &quot;Exorcist? I could tell that your large sword is a holy weapon, but I didn&#39;t think you 
were an exorcist.&quot; Tsuru flushed at her words.

      &quot;Ah, I... I was. I lost my holy power and my resolve a long time ago. I spent a while 
trying to find myself. I&#39;m better with these weapons and physical strength then holy powers. 
I still remember rituals and procedures, but they&#39;re a bit outdated.&quot;

      The blonde gave her an appreciative look. &quot;Wow, that&#39;s crazy. My type of exorcism is a 
lost art, or at least, it&#39;s a very selective one. I only got lucky that I found someone to 
teach me. Maybe we should get together sometime!&quot;

      Tsuru&#39;s heart skipped a beat. Oh yes, she would love to get together with this girl. 
She would love that. &quot;My name is Tsuru, what&#39;s yours?&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Tsuru. I&#39;m Krystal.&quot; 

***** 

      Isaka sat on the couch, staring at the ceiling. Where was her delicious little 
Krystal? The blonde woman had pleasantly tired her out the last time they made love and 
happened to leave Isaka behind while she went out on another job.

      She started to absent mindedly flip channels. She wished Krystal would just wake her 
up instead. The note Krystal left behind did state that Isaka was so cute while she slept, 
so maybe that&#39;s why she was left to dream of her love.

      As though her demonic prayers had been answered, Krystal opened the front door. Isaka 
resisted the urge to pounce and instead settled for giving her a heated look. &quot;How was your 
little mission?&quot;

      Krystal started removing some of her clothing. &quot;It was fine, but it was another shadow 
beast. I&#39;ve been seeing them a lot, plus I got attacked by something else today. There&#39;s 
probably a stronger demon controlling all this.&quot;

      As she started heading towards the bedroom to deposit her dirty clothes in the hamper, 
Krystal felt lithe lands clasp around her naked waist. &quot;Well, that isn&#39;t important now,&quot; 
Isaka murmured into her ear. Krystal just giggled. &quot;Isaka, I&#39;m all dirty, you know. I got 
blasted in the woods.&quot;

      The demon just hugged her closer. &quot;Ah, but you undressing is really... heh, do you 
need help in the shower?&quot;

      Krystal flushed and broke free of her arms. &quot;Maybe...&quot; Isaka watched as her lover 
walked away, taking off her clothing at the same time. She looked over her shoulder at the 
demon before disappearing into the bathroom.

      Isaka smiled to herself and followed as Krystal shut the door. So that&#39;s how she 
wanted to play, then... She reached for the knob and opened the door-

      The demon stopped and twisted the knob again. No good. She took a deep breath and 
tried again, feeling resistance and a slight click. &quot;K-Krystal...?&quot; She could hear the other 
woman laughing behind the door.

      &quot;Sorry, Isaka. I love you, but if I let you in, we&#39;ll never be done with the shower.&quot; 
The demon tried to open the locked door again before letting out a frustrated sound.

      &quot;Krystal! You can&#39;t make me all horny and then do that!&quot; The water being turned on was 
her only response and Isaka let out a groan. She picked up Krystal&#39;s clothing and put it in 
the hamper, disgruntled with her partner&#39;s actions.

      15 minutes... that was usually how long Krystal took to shower. Just 15 minutes. It 
was at times like these that Isaka started to wonder if she really was a nymphomaniac. It 
wasn&#39;t like she was going to die or anything...

      Isaka sat back down on the couch and crossed her legs. 15 minutes. She had been 
without Krystal for a few hours, so a couple minutes was nothing - nothing at all. She felt 
her resolve crack a bit. Maybe she could use her shadow powers to magically appear in the 
shower... but then Krystal would be mad. And a mad Krystal left her feeling bad inside.

      Only 12 minutes now. 12 minutes. &quot;I&#39;m going to die!&quot; 

***** 

      When Krystal emerged from her shower, she unlocked the door and stood still, waiting 
for her demon to fling open the door. Nothing so far. She opened the door, peeked out and 
looked for her demon. There was nothing. Krystal stepped outside and turned off the light in 
the bathroom.

      She was dripping wet, only wearing a towel and vulnerably standing out side of the 
bathroom. Isaka should have been all over her. She went towards the living room and saw 
nothing. That was disturbing. What if Isaka magically appeared where she couldn&#39;t see her?

      Honestly, Krystal didn&#39;t mind because she wanted Isaka to come get her, but...

      The exorcist headed back to her room, ready to change. Of course she was surprised 
with what she found lying in her bed.

      How Isaka managed to fall asleep was beyond her. Krystal sat down on the edge of the 
bed, looking over the beautiful, sleeping demon. She was curled up, clutching onto Krystal&#39;s 
pillow. The blonde stroked her head before leaning down. She let one hand hold on to her 
towel as she gave Isaka a gentle kiss on the lips.

      The demon stirred, but did nothing. So Krystal kissed her again... and again... and 
again, until Isaka had a firm grip on her shoulders and her tongue was teasing Krystal&#39;s 
lips. The blonde pulled back and said, &quot;Did you get tired of waiting?&quot;

      She let out a yelp when Isaka pulled her down on top of her. &quot;I settled for having 
nice dreams of you.&quot; She giggled in response to the demon, but kissed her again. 

***** 

      Tsuru stared at the phone in her hand. She&#39;d gotten home a while ago and had been 
sitting around, thinking. Krystal had her phone number. To Tsuru. And it was already saved 
on her &#39;contacts&#39;. So she could call Krystal to get together. &quot;I&#39;m such a looooseeeer!&quot;

      So she had a huge crush on some girl she&#39;d just met, even though said girl already has 
someone. But it wouldn&#39;t hurt to try, right? Tsuru leaned back against the couch, thinking 
of Krystal. The beautiful blonde girl, with such a nice body... and she&#39;d been so nice too.

      If she was with Krystal, well... Tsuru drifted off into fantasy happy world until her 
phone vibrated. She fumbled with it and found that it was a text. And it was spam. The light 
blue haired girl screamed into a cushion. She was such a weirdo. 

***** 

      Krystal let out a sigh of content, happily being spooned by the demon behind them. 
They were both naked and the blonde wondered where her towel had gone. Oh well - it wasn&#39;t 
like she cared. She played with Isaka&#39;s fingertips that were resting on her stomach and 
could hear the demon growl slightly in her ear.

      &quot;I never understand why you don&#39;t just let me come into the shower with you all the 
time,&quot; the brunette said.

      &quot;Well, we would waste all the hot water...&quot; Isaka nuzzled into her neck in response 
and Krystal snuggled closer. It was sometime in the late afternoon, maybe dinner time, but 
she wouldn&#39;t mind going under the covers and going to sleep.

      &quot;If we took a shower together, we could get clean and make love - or maybe make love 
then get clean.&quot;

      Krystal laughed at her suggestion. &quot;But that makes it sound so... compact.&quot;

      Isaka was silent before saying, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. It isn&#39;t something I can it into 
a schedule.&quot; Krystal tensed up as she felt one of the hands she&#39;d been playing with drift 
down lower towards her navel.

      Maybe she wouldn&#39;t be getting much sleep that afternoon.

      Isaka was about to pleasure her little lover when Krystal&#39;s phone went off. The blonde 
opened her eyes and started to get up. The demon instead pushed her down and held her 
tighter. &quot;That ring tone means it&#39;s a personal call - not business. They can leave a 
message.&quot;

      As much as the exorcist wanted to stay in the warm embrace of Isaka and make love 
again, her phone was ringing. She gave the demon and apologetic smile before sitting up and 
grabbing it. &quot;What if it&#39;s Tycara or Abby? It could still be important.&quot;

      Isaka pouted, but settled with resting her head in Krystal&#39;s lap. The blonde woman 
answered the phone as she started to stroke her lover&#39;s brown hair.

      &quot;Hello?&quot;
