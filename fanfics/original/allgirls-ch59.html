<h1>All Girls School (part 59 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/allgirls-ch58.html">Back to Part 58</a><pre>Hero: Hi, all! Magical fairies of wonder Hero and Ayanna here to greet 
you all!

Ayanna: And here you thought you&#39;d seen the end of us and our cool 
costumes!

Hero: Well, mine&#39;s kinda snug...

Ayanna: All the better for me, honey pinches

Hero: Yeowch! ...That kinda felt good.

Ayanna: Ooh, you like that, babe?

Hero: Umm... sweat drops Anyway, let&#39;s continue with the story, shall 
we?

Ayanna: Yes. Today, we are most proud to present to you a totally 
made-up farcical chapter, one pitting our heroines in situations so 
unlikely and absurd, you&#39;d be crazy to think they&#39;re real.

Hero: We&#39;re also going to include several special cameo appearances, but 
since they&#39;re so special, we can&#39;t tell you who they are yet.

Ayanna: Let&#39;s just say you&#39;ll be pleased.

Hero: We also want to give a shout-out to the story for passing its one 
year mark! Happy birthday, &quot;All Girls School&quot;! May your greatness never 
fail, and may your failures never be great!

Ayanna: Finally, a magical treat for you all: fan service at long last, 
starting with the two of us! Hey Hero, just how snug is that fairy 
costume of yours?

Hero: blush Y-yikes...! I dunno whether I should be scared or excited. 
Ayanna&#39;s giving me the eyes, folks! What should I do?

Italy Ishida: I think we all know the answer to that!

Hero and Ayanna: ITALY ISHIDA!!?

Ayanna: What are you doing here? I thought your cameo appearance had 
already passed.

Italy: Yeah, well, a contract&#39;s a contract. Heh&#151;know you know we&#39;ll be 
sued!

Ayanna and Hero: --

Italy: Enjoy, folks! And don&#39;t forget to visit me at &quot;The Lounge&quot;!

Hero: Gahh, shameless self-promotion!!

&quot;A Puck&#39;s Fine Day&quot;

The farcical AGS chapter

&quot;Very nice, Tristan,&quot; said Ethan Nikholai, obviously bored. &quot;What else 
can you tell me before our time runs out and I slip into a coma?&quot;

&quot;Well, there was with one time I actually met Frank Gorshin, the guy who 
played the Riddler. He was a...very polite gentleman, but he 
never...struck me as the kind to be all that dangerous, least not along 
the lines of, say, Burgess Meredith or Cesar Romero. And...another time, 
at this convention, Lee Meriwether&#151;&quot;

Zing! Cut off, just like that. Ethan jolted awake, having fallen asleep 
of course.

&quot;Huh? What was that? Oh, did we lose him? ...Okay. We&#39;re back on the air 
with special guest star, Drew Carey! Or was it Carey Elwes? Or Drew 
Barrymore? Maybe it was Carey Barrymore&#151;Carey Barry? The Care Bears?&quot;

&quot;Egad!&quot; exclaimed Avelina. Ethan nodded.

&quot;Yes, I agree completely. Now what in the world happened to Tristan? 
Vai? Vai, is he still there? Vai, where the heck is Tristan?&quot;

Vairocana Knox did not answer.

&quot;Darn that woman,&quot; he sighed. Ethan got up and walked over to where Vai 
was supposed to be, but only found a ransom note instead. It read...

&quot;Surrender control of your talk show and give me all your DVDs! If you 
fail to comply, I will have your precious director thrown into a Death 
Mine! Sincerely, Evil Lord Gary&quot;

&quot;Holy stolen characters, Ethan!&quot; exclaimed Avelina. &quot;Vai&#39;s been 
kidnapped!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, old chum, and there&#39;s only one person who can rescue her 
from the clutches of...EVIL LORD GARY!&quot;

&quot;You mean Burt Ward?&quot;

&quot;No, me! Now turn around so that I can transform!&quot; Avelina wheeled 
around. Meanwhile, back where Ethan was, a hideous mutation was taking 
place! So hideous, that it must...BE CENSORED!!!

&quot;GAHH!&quot;

KA-BOOM!!!

&quot;I shiver with power!&quot; quoth he as the smoke settled. &quot;I ache with 
vengeance! I...am WOM...batman!&quot;

&quot;Holy transformation, Wombatman!&quot; exclaimed Avelina. Ethan smacked his 
fist into his palm.

&quot;That&#39;s right, old chum! And I&#39;m gonna stop...EVIL LORD GARY, or my name 
isn&#39;t...WOMBATMAN!&quot; Ethan swung his fist into the air just to 
demonstrate how he was going to stop...you know who.

BAM!!

&quot;Hey, that was cool!&quot; squealed Avi.

&quot;Yeah, I know. Throw a punch and you get a word!&quot;

THWACK!!

BIFF!!

POW!!

SPOON!!

&quot;Punch an adjective!&quot; said Avi. Ethan swung...

LOOPY!!

&quot;Punch a preposition!&quot;

BETWEEN!!

&quot;Punch...the state capital of Rhode Island!&quot;

PROVIDENCE!!

&quot;Look well into the face of justice, Evil Lord Gary!&quot; exclaimed 
Ethan/Wombatman once he was all punched out. &quot;For soon, it is a face 
that will spell the end of your reign of evil! And I mean that 
literally, since...I can...spell. ...Really fast! So...watch out!&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; cheered Avi. &quot;Now I gotta go change too, into your sidekick.&quot;

&quot;No time for that, old chum. You&#39;ve got to get to the control room.&quot;

&quot;For butter and cheese?&quot;

&quot;No, we need to contact the spirits of Frank Gorshin and Burgess 
Meredith. Only they know the true scope of evil. Only they can help us.&quot;

&quot;But you said you were the only one that could&#151;&quot;

&quot;Never mind! Just do it!&quot; Avelina sighed.

&quot;Yes, dear.&quot;

(the Wombatman signal pans forward and back quickly)

Avelina sat in the control room and called up the spirits of dead Batman 
villains...and surprisingly, one showed up!

&quot;Burgess Meredith!&quot;

Bum-bum-bumm!!!

&quot;...You were the Penguin!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. So what can I do for ya, kid?&quot;

&quot;...Danny Devito was better.&quot;

&quot;Bah, he was a bum. He was born a bum, he lived like a bum, he directed 
movies like a bum, he&#39;ll die like a bum.&quot; Avi froze.

&quot;Okay, that&#39;s the last time we&#39;ll have any Rocky references. Sheesh!&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s an insult to one&#39;s acting if they remain consistent. I 
prefer larger roles that don&#39;t typecast me.&quot;

&quot;Good luck with that,&quot; she murmured. &quot;So Burgess, Evil Lord Gary has 
kidnapped my buddy Vai. Will you help us with your years of experience?&quot;

&quot;Hey, I got a news flash for ya: I&#39;m dead! What does it look like?!&quot;

A pause.

&quot;So...is that a yes?&quot;

&quot;.........No.&quot;

&quot;So is that a, &#39;No I won&#39;t help&#39;, or a &#39;Yes, that&#39;s a no&#39;?&quot;

&quot;...This is screwy.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re aiming for, pal.&quot;

Meanwhile!

Zip!

&quot;Oh, am I on again?&quot;

&quot;Tristan!&quot;

Bum-bum-bumm!!

It was Tristan Reeves (Ivory&#39;s best friend&#39;s boyfriend), back from the 
void of televised space.

&quot;Good to see you back, Tris. We&#39;re having a villain problem.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Do you think it could be Dr. Stabs-a-Lot?&quot;

&quot;No, we ruled him out. Malpractice suit.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well, what about Rubber Rear, the man with an eraser for a butt?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s...busy. Erasing things. With his butt.&quot;

&quot;I see, I see. What about Professor Murder?&quot;

&quot;Um, he&#39;s...dead.&quot;

&quot;Did you forget...Y2K Woman?&quot;

&quot;Oh, she was beaten by Y2K-Compliant woman. And a big ball of Nobody 
Cares.&quot; A pause.

&quot;What about Yul Brinner? He&#39;s got a shiny head.&quot;

&quot;Yes! I must admit, that man has a shiny head. Never have I seen such a 
gleam on a man&#39;s noggin before.&quot;

&quot;And Natalie Portman...now there&#39;s a shiny head for ya.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, when she&#39;s not parading around in that Star Wars crap, she&#151;HEY, 
are you trying to distract me?&quot; Tristan laughed.

&quot;Am I a bad talk show guest?&quot; Ethan/Wombatman frowned. Then he punched 
him.

BOOF!!

&quot;Put that in your Batcave and drive it!&quot;

Meanwhile...

&quot;Burgess Meredith...... Gimme a dollar!&quot;

Bum-bum-bumm!!

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; he whispered.

&quot;I said gimme your money!!!&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear...&quot;

Meanwhile-meanwhile...

&quot;That was a waste of guest time&#151;oh, I got another transmission!&quot; Ethan 
reactivated his television set&#151;but on the other end was the dreaded Evil 
Lord Gary!

&quot;Ah, Wombatman, at last we meet!&quot;

&quot;Do I know you?&quot;

&quot;No! But soon you will, for I am about to tell you! And when I tell you, 
you&#39;ll know! I am the Evil Lord! Buwhahahahahahahahaaaaa!!!!&quot;

There is an awkward pause.

&quot;......Gary.&quot;

Bum-bum-bumm!!

Ethan gasped: &quot;You&#39;re Evil Lord Gary??!?!?!?!!?&quot;

&quot;YES!!!&quot;

Bum-bum-bumm!!

A pause.

&quot;Man...what were your parents thinking?&quot;

&quot;Shut up! Shut up! I hate my stupid name! I sent my parents to 
Miltorkka&#39;s Death Mines for giving me such a horrible name!&quot; Ethan 
gawked.

&quot;You killed your own parents?!&quot;

&quot;Well...no, not really. But I&#39;m planning to, as soon as I move out of 
the house!&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t even moved out yet?&quot; he snickered. &quot;How old are you, 
anyway? Thirty, twenty-five?&quot;

&quot;I shall be 27 this coming week!&quot; Ethan laughed out loud; Evil Lord Gary 
snapped at him. &quot;Shut up, shut up! How dare you mock me and my perfect 
villainy! Just for that, the deadline for releasing your friend has just 
been shortened!&quot;

&quot;Holy Bob Kane! I forgot all about her! You monster!!!&quot;

&quot;You have just one hour left, Wombatman!&quot; exclaimed ELG wickedly. 
&quot;Surrender control of your show or else! Once your time expires, I shall 
send both your friend and my parents to the Death Mines! There they will 
live the rest of their short, miserable lives in agony! 
Mruahahahahahahaahaha!!!!!&quot;

There is an awkward pause.

&quot;Gwuahahahahahahaha!!!&quot;

Another awkward pause.

&quot;How do you...turn this stupid webcam off? Lousy, stinking...the guy at 
the store said all I had to do was push this button. ...I&#39;m pushing it. 
Am I off?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no. I can still see you.&quot;

&quot;Drat! Another enemy of mine to throw into the mines! Stupid, 
raggin-fraggin&#151;&quot;

Will Wombatman be able to save his friend in time? Will Evil Lord Gary 
triumph and have not one but several last laughs? Will Avelina ever 
actually accomplish anything with the spirits of the Penguin and the 
Riddler? Or will she simply continue those one-line phrases that are 
always punctuated by suspenseful yet cheap music? WHAT WILL HAPPEN?! 
Will anything happen? The answers...are yes, no, no, yes, Good Lord Yes, 
and maybe.

Alexandra &quot;Furious Hail&quot; was sleeping in Mrs. Keys&#39; art class one day, 
dreaming of Corona (both the girl and the beer, which led to dreams of 
Corona drinking...Corona), when she found herself the subject of a 
Victorian-era ladies&#39; dress!!

Bum-bum-

Hold on, we&#39;re not doing the suspenseful music in this section.

Sorry.

Right. Anyway, Alex was in a dress!

&quot;OMG, I&#39;m in a dress!&quot; she exclaimed, noticing the obvious. She turned 
around, getting a good look at herself in a mirror. She grinned and 
exclaimed, &quot;Hey, this actually makes me look kinda hot! Maybe I oughta 
wear it when Corona takes me on our next date.&quot; With thoughts of her 
beloved in her mind, Alex Blair started walking, not knowing where 
though. Suddenly, she saw a white rabbit and realized exactly where this 
was going!

&quot;Umm...a Matrix parody?&quot; Yes, Alex, wearing a Victorian dress and 
following a rabbit down a hole will lead to a Matrix parody. &quot;Well, it 
can&#39;t possibly be worse than Matrix Revolutions.&quot; She has a point, 
folks. As it turned out, though, the bunny was really Alisha Fox, and 
she was really quite revealing in it, just like a Playboy bunny only 
with a little bit more class.

&quot;And yet less of an endowment,&quot; she moped, examining her you-know-what. 
Alex followed her, as the plot dictated, and found herself in a very, 
VERY big room. But everything else was tiny! And Alisha the Rabbit was 
gone!

&quot;So now what?&quot; she asked. Along came a griffin&#151;really it was Nomi&#151;and a 
mock-turtle (Amina), and each one presented to her a bottle&#151;both, as you 
probably have guessed, marked &quot;Drink Me&quot;.

&quot;We get paid for every word the author writes,&quot; explained Nakatori, &quot;so 
don&#39;t think we&#39;re humiliating ourselves for free.&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; whispered Amina, &quot;I like turtles. And Lewis Carrol.&quot;

&quot;We are so sued,&quot; sighed Blair. She shrugged, then chugged, and also got 
mugged! Alisha ran by and stole all her clothes! &quot;GACK! My sexy 
Victorian dress! Come back here you wascawwy wabbit!&quot; Speaking of being 
sued... &quot;Not now, I gots ta get me stuff back!&quot; So Alex streaked after 
the mischievous bunny-girl, only slightly aware that a pun had just been 
made. She also felt a chill that had not been there a few minutes 
earlier. Soon she discovered why.

&quot;Hey!&quot; exclaimed Zane, appearing out of nowhere. &quot;She&#39;s NAKED!!!&quot; 
Everyone turned to gasp and look; Hail sputtered and ran off, covered 
only by the occasional, well-placed leaf.

&quot;No, no, you got it all wrong! Men have leaves, women 
have...uh...Y-shaped objects!&quot; Well, all right, she was covered by 
Y-shaped objects from time to time. Which brings me to my next point: 
climate control. Am I right, folks?

&quot;STAY ON TRACK!!!&quot;

Whoops, sorry. Got distracted. Anyway, Alexandra&#151;now truly furious&#151;found 
some poor schmuck to rob, and beat him senseless so she could steal his 
clothes. Of course, this made many fans sad (being as how she was no 
longer naked), but it made others rather happy since Miss Blair can look 
sexy in almost anything she wears.

&quot;I swear, when I find something to shove up your ass&#151;anything, 
really&#151;you had best just watch out.&quot; Ah. Point taken. Alex ran about 
looking for Alisha to retrieve her nice clothes, but then ran into a 
crack-smoking caterpillar! Who came from out of nowhere!

&quot;Actually, it&#39;s just all us teachers on a smoke break,&quot; said Hitomi. 
Alex sighed with relief and joined them, taking a few puffs&#151;HEY! You 
can&#39;t be smoking now! You&#39;ve got a rabbit to chase after!

&quot;Oh, and then what? Have graphic sex?&quot; Well, uh, yes. &quot;Sorry, man, 
Alisha&#39;s not my type. I&#39;d much rather snuggle up with my sweet Corona. &quot; 
Which, the beer or the girl? &quot;Both. &quot; I see. Well then, Alisha ran into 
the Queen of Hearts, who was really just Olivia in a red dominatrix 
outfit. The bunny and the queen had some &quot;private meetings&quot; together, 
giving Alex time to retrieve her dress.

&quot;I&#39;m going to change,&quot; she alerted the author. &quot;No peeking.&quot; Uh, sorry 
folks, you&#39;re gonna have to look away for awhile. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s 
happening elsewhere.

When we last left Wombatman and his trusty sidekick, Evil Lord Gary had 
just finished making unreasonable demands! We also learned that Evil 
Lord Gary was really a wussy villain who still lived with his parents, 
and was probably being kicked around by Vai a lot. Avelina, meanwhile, 
was having a heart-to-heart with the ghosts of old Batman villains, and 
Ethan was exercising his right to make words from his punches. And now, 
let&#39;s tune in to the conclusion of...the first section of this chapter!

&quot;I bet that narrator&#39;s worn out by now,&quot; mentioned Ethan.

Bum-bum&#151;wait, are we back?

Yes, we&#39;re back.

Just checking. ...BUMM!!!!!

&quot;Also, that spider needs a shave.&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot; screamed Victoria. &quot;Don&#39;t shave Dick Tracey!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I must! To save the world!&quot; Ethan walked up to Victoria&#39;s 
pet spider with an electric razor, grinning wickedly as he aimed it at 
the non-bug-like creature. &quot;Dick Tracey, you need a shave!&quot; ZZT! &quot;Ow!! 
...Stupid spider bit me!&quot;

&quot;Serves you right,&quot; pouted Vicki, snuggling her poor pet. Dick Tracey 
gave Ethan the finger (eight times over!) and squeaked as he returned 
Vicki&#39;s love. June, who had observed it all, blanched.

&quot;She&#39;s hugging that spider more than she&#39;s hugging me!&quot;

&quot;June!&quot; screamed Vicki randomly. &quot;Let&#39;s take another bath together!&quot;

&quot;...Okay! &quot; They went off&#151;Ethan gawked.

&quot;But the shave...&quot; He looked at Gabrielle, who snatched poor Muraki away 
before she too could be stripped of hair, then at Lilian, who snorted as 
she stood over her doggies protectively. Ethan would not get to shave 
any pets that day.

&quot;You can shave me!&quot; exclaimed the &quot;other&quot; Alex. Ethan stared at Miss 
Walker.

&quot;A bald female...oh, why not? The author has a sick fetish for bald 
girls. And redheads. And albinos.&quot; After reading off exactly how many 
fetishes I had, Ethan resumed his shaving quest and robbed Alex of all 
her hair. She stood happy and bald before the world, hugged Ethan, then 
went skipping along in search of another girlfriend. Ethan, meanwhile, 
was left with Walker&#39;s hair, and of course, the Boog.

&quot;We must get this hair to Evil Lord Gary before he sends our friend Vai 
to the Death Mines!&quot; he exclaimed. Meanwhile, Captain Plot Device was 
being paid handsomely for his role in this story...

Meanwhile...

&quot;Hey Frank. I just wanted to tell you, Jim Carrey really blew it when he 
played your role. To me, you shall always be the Riddler.&quot;

&quot;I think this Batman parody thing has worn out its welcome,&quot; he told 
her. &quot;I&#39;m sure the author wants to get back to when Alex was in 
Wonderland. Heh! Alex in Wonderland! Get it?&quot;

&quot;I get it,&quot; sighed Avelina. She then punched the ghost of Frank Gorshin.

PTOOIE!!

&quot;That&#39;s a new one,&quot; she observed. &quot;But now we have no more ghosts to 
summon, unless somebody wants to go out and make some more.&quot;

Ethan: Avi, that&#39;s a terrible thing to say!

Avi: Since when are we doing script format?

Ethan: Since the author got lazy.

Avi: Oh. Well, let&#39;s get cracking. Evil Lord Gary won&#39;t be waiting 
forever.

ELG: Actually, your time is up! Such mindless lollygagging has ruined 
the life of your friend! Now, to the Death Mines with her!

Ethan: But we have the hair...

ELG: Oh, well, that changes everything. ...Oh, what the heck&#151;into the 
Death Mines anyway!

Avi: What?! Nuuuuuu!!!

Ethan: VAIII!!!! Vai...Vai...

&quot;Snurkk! Huh, what?&quot; Ethan Nikholai suddenly woke up, finding himself 
back in his seat, with Tristan still going on about his usual nonsense. 
&quot;Oh, hey, it was all a dream! God, could the author be any less 
original? That whole dream sequence ending is older than dirt!&quot;

&quot;Hey, it works,&quot; said Vai. Ethan and Avi squealed.

&quot;VAI! Is that really you?&quot;

&quot;Yup, in the flesh. Well, not really; I&#39;m just a fictional character.&quot;

&quot;Good enough. Ya know what, I&#39;m so happy we&#39;re all safe and sound, let&#39;s 
celebrate. Tonight, the steaks are on me!&quot;

&quot;Yay!!

Avelina suddenly wakes up in her bed and realizes that she, too, has 
been dreaming

Avi: What a strange dream. Hey, waitasecond! How could I have a dream 
about Ethan having a dream?! Unless...

Vai: Morning hunny!

Avi: AAAAH!!! This is a dream too, isn&#39;t it?

Later, Vai woke up, realized that she had dreamt it all, then went 
outside. The sky, as always, was still purple.

Evil Lord Gary: But I never got my chocolate milk!

&quot;There, that&#39;s better!&quot; Alexandra Blair finally finished changing back 
into her Victorian dress, and just in time, too! Kathlyn the Cheshire 
Cat had arrived.

&quot;So now I&#39;m Katt the Cat?&quot; Yeah, pretty much. &quot;Bah! Who else saw that 
one coming? Go on, raise your hands. I&#39;ve got all day.&quot; Thankfully, 
Leena came by to remove her sweetheart (aw, c&#39;mon, it wasn&#39;t like they 
weren&#39;t gonna hook up), leaving Alex free to date Corona at long last. 
Unfortunately, miss Marcos was wearing the exact same dress as her 
girlfriend&#151;the ultimate faux pas!

&quot;Noooo!!!!&quot;

Alex suddenly bolted upright, her body covered with sweat. She breathed 
quickly before realizing she had been asleep in her room the whole time. 
She grumbled: &quot;Whoa, I gotta lay off the shrooms. Did that really 
happen, or was it just some magical dream?&quot;

&quot;You tell me, sweetie!&quot; said Corona, laying next to her in a bunny 
costume. Alex would&#39;ve screamed and pulled her hair out, but hey, you 
don&#39;t get too many opportunities like this, so she took it&#151;and how!

Miss Marbel gathered all the students together in the gymnasium for an 
assembly. It was one of those miraculous days where everybody was 
present and accounted for, so naturally, the place was both crowded and 
loud. She could silence them, though, and stood at the podium clearing 
her throat in an attempt to do so. Suddenly, Steve McQueen came from out 
of nowhere, and all the lesbians in the room got hearts bulging in their 
eyes. Lotta hearts.

&quot;Why Steve McQueen?&quot; asked Marbel.

&quot;Simple,&quot; explained Ivory. &quot;He is only one of three men, that I know of, 
that can turn any gay girl straight! The other two are Billy Lee Black 
from Xenogears&#151;&quot; At the mere mention of the priest, nearly all the girls 
in the auditorium sighed dreamily. &quot;And of course,&quot; continued Ivory, 
&quot;Randolph Scott.&quot;

&quot;Randolph Scott?&quot; blurted Ancelin. She along with everyone else stood up 
and covered their hearts with their hands. In unison they cried, 
&quot;RANDOLPH SCOTT!&quot;, and sat back down. McQueen cleared his throat.

&quot;...Okay. Uh...everyone quiet please. Your teacher&#39;s got a word for 
you.&quot; The girls naturally obeyed; Marbel resumed, her face flushed.

&quot;Ah, yes. As you all know, the Christmas season is upon us. Now I 
realize that most of you will want to run around with mistletoe hats, 
give presents, and stay places for New Year&#39;s, but we&#39;ve got to have a 
decorum of order here! I can&#39;t just allow all of you to slack off and 
ride the rest of the month; we&#39;re going to buckle down here. That 
includes midterms, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all looking forward to.&quot; 
Naturally, none of the girls were; they were rather looking forward to 
Steve McQueen doing wonderful things with his motorcycle.

&quot;So without further delay,&quot; concluded the Headmistress, &quot;we should all 
return to class and realize that the toughest days are ahead&#151;so you had 
all best behave. Any chaos will not be tolerated!&quot; Suddenly, of course, 
a great big ball of chaos rolled into the auditorium, banging through 
the doors until it forced itself inside. The girls stood up in 
exclamation as they saw that it was every single character from the 
author&#39;s first interactive story!! The auditorium became crowded as 
Sayrah, Diana Jade, Dana Withers, Zet the elf, Sahn, Greg Rodriguez, 
Woolyford the goat, Cat Prepells, Dustin Harper, Jerwon Nodsten, General 
Brokolov, Melena Fara&#39;dellyn, Titania Prepells, Ketra Glang, Shadi, 
Malecanthrite, Frost, Cedro Fontano, Sean Gilliam, Klarana, and Seraph 
Stone stuffed themselves inside it.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; demanded Marbel.

&quot;Uh, remember Hero and Ayanna talking about special guest appearances?&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Technically our contract hasn&#39;t expired yet.&quot;

&quot;Hey, there&#39;s some missing!&quot;

&quot;Oh. ...They&#39;re all dead.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Soon everybody got in a terrific fight (except for Jerwon and 
Seraph

Stone, whom most of the girls were cuddling/ogling), with interactive 
story characters flying everywhere. Things didn&#39;t calm down from there, 
however, as the ceiling immediately blew up. Several figured rappelled 
down to meet the increased crowd, and wouldn&#39;t you know it, it was every 
single character from the author&#39;s second interactive story!! Aisuna, 
Kit Hiro, Eien Kinu, Captain Jack Lazarus, Shellby Blake, Lantariz 
Tornheart, Asuka Honmisei, Bloodstorm, Keiko Yamanaka, Glavius, Ichi, 
Thirteen (not the &quot;Champions&quot; one), Max Rockwell, Silvara, Brinna 
Ptolemie, Galaga Starik, Kagai Shazou, Matthew Dark, and Miichi Zuroi 
all descended down, standing before the casts of the author&#39;s &quot;other&quot; 
two interactive stories.

&quot;This is going a bit overboard,&quot; muttered Marbel. Unfortunately, things 
went awry after that: Kit and Eien were too busy cuddling, Shellby and 
Lantariz wanted time to themselves, Asuka and Brinna snuck off for hot 
dancer-elf sex, more than a few characters from AGS egged Silvara and 
Miichi about getting together, and everyone that had died in the 
interactive story now died again. By explosion.

&quot;Gaah, what&#39;s next&#151;the Spanish Inquisition?!&quot; No sooner had Gabrielle 
said that, did the windows break open and shatter, ushering in a large 
team of elderly pirates.

&quot;Worse!&quot; shouted Mira. &quot;It&#39;s the Crimson Permanent Assurance!!!&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s our Monty Python reference for the day...&quot; The auditorium 
came alive with battle as every character from the author&#39;s interactive 
stories (except that one, which was never finished, and of course the 
superhero one), plus the Crimson Permanent Assurance, got into a huge, 
violent free-for-all. I do expressly apologize for this interruption, 
but rest assured, steps are being taken to fix it.

Meanwhile, aboard the Death Star...

Darth Vader observes the goings-on in Stanton, and knowing what the 
author wants to do, points a dreadful finger at Imperial Officer #4.

&quot;You, dog! Prepare to fire the Death Star on my count!&quot;

&quot;Death Star prepared to fire, sir!&quot;

&quot;Good! Fire at will!&quot; The Death Star charged up, blasted its immense 
laser, and instantly blew up David Carradine. Vader turned and laid an 
invisible scowl at the Officer. He could only chuckle weakly.

&quot;Well, whaddya know? We killed Bill. Tarantino&#39;s not gonna like this.&quot;

&quot;At least we didn&#39;t shoot Will from Illusion of Gaia again,&quot; muttered 
Officer #7.

&quot;Yeah, that one&#39;s getting old.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; spat Vader. &quot;Destroy the planet Earth!&quot;

&quot;Yes sir!&quot; The Death Star prepared to fire another blast; meanwhile, of 
course, our heroes and heroines had no idea of the imminent doom they 
would soon face. But they would!! Until then, it was up to June to stop 
the madness, so she wheeled close to the podium and shouted.

&quot;HEY! Everybody freeze!&quot; Frost, of course, cackled wickedly, but she 
gave him a &quot;you know that&#39;s not what I meant&quot; glare that chilled even 
him. June got up and slammed her fist on the podium angrily: &quot;I cannot 
tolerate this anymore! Now everybody stop; let&#39;s not fight again. Don&#39;t 
you see? We can use our combined skills to take over the 
world......cattle industry!&quot;

&quot;June, your legs!&quot; June looked down, noticing that she was standing up 
for once. She screamed and raised her fists in the air.

&quot;Meine fuehrer! I&#39;M WALKING!!!!!!&quot;

KA-BOOM!!!!!

Some time later, around the old campfire...

&quot;I guess that must&#39;ve been the only time the author killed off lesbians 
in this story,&quot; observed Ancelin. Ivory nodded.

&quot;Yeah. Well, glad he got it out of his system. And hey, technically, 
none of this happened anyway.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re right! Now let&#39;s cuddle!&quot;

&quot;Yee! &quot; Ivory and Ancelin cuddled, and soon practically everyone 
attached themselves to somebody else (yes, yes, May and Janine started 
snuggling too, you happy? Fan-service over), except of course for Vai. 
As usual, she was left with nobody to love, but not to worry, folks! 
I&#39;ve got the perfect solution!

Zing! The girls gasped in unison.

&quot;It&#39;s Mr. Toasty! And he&#39;s finally made his prerequisite cameo 
appearance!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s me,&quot; I said humbly. A few of the girls rushed over for 
autographs and stuff, but I pushed through and made my way to Vai. She 
smiled shyly and nodded.

&quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;Hi. So, I guess you wouldn&#39;t mind hooking up with me for a bit.&quot;

&quot;No, not at all. &quot; I squealed happily and picked her up in my arms; Kula 
snorted.

&quot;You do realize that she&#39;s a fictitious character, right?&quot;

&quot;So? I don&#39;t care. This is as close as I&#39;ll get to a real girlfriend, so 
don&#39;t ruin it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, buzz-kill! Party pooper! Wet blanket! Sour grape! ...Um...nerd 
gobbler!&quot;

&quot;Hey, I resent that,&quot; she grumbled.

&quot;So, Mr. Toasty,&quot; said Vai cheerfully, &quot;how do you think we&#39;ll end this 
chapter?&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been pondering it for a long time, Vai, and I came to the 
only conclusion worth speaking of. ...LET&#39;S HAVE AN ORGY!&quot;

&quot;Yee!&quot; squealed about five dozen girls. So everybody (censored). 
Somebody (censored) while somebody else (censored) with their 
(censored). Hitomi and Abby (censored) with their (censored) on top of 
the (censored) with Leena&#39;s (censored). Mr. Toasty (censored) around 
(censored) random preposition meant to represent unspoken sexual act 
(censored) salad dressing! Ana and Rai (censored) with a midget, while 
(censored) with (censored) until (censored) broke! (censored) (censored) 
(censored) (censored) pencil!

Meanwhile...

&quot;I wonder what everybody else is doing.&quot; Avelina posed this thought to 
Ethan as they sat cuddled in a couch by a fire; he smiled gently and 
squeezed her a little closer.

&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re all having fun. But are you positive you don&#39;t want to 
join them?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I think I&#39;ll just stay here...with you.&quot; She kissed him and 
rested her head against his chest; he took time in caressing her hair, 
until they both drifted off and slipped into another fanciful dream...

If we shadows have offended,

Think but this, and all is mended:

That you have but slumbered here,

While these visions did appear;

And this weak and idle theme,

No more yielding but a dream,

Gentles, do not reprehend.

If you will pardon, we will mend.

And as I am an honest puck,

If we have unearned luck

Now to &#39;scape the serpent&#39;s tongue,

We will make amends ere long,

Else the puck a liar call.

So, good night unto you all.

Give me your hands, if we be friends,

And Mr. Toasty shall restore amends!
