<h1>Guardian Angel Remastered</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;I learned this later--- after I did some research on the topic.&#148;

The blade jumps upwards, Keiko&#146;s arm holding it tight as it reflects 
the downward swipe of her opponent&#146;s hunting knife. The weapon, normal 
by most standards though wielded by a strong adversary, shatters 
against the mystical &#147;cursed&#148; blade of Yamanaka, the 7th Judgment.

&#147;There&#146;s this legend, in the waking world or in fictionalities, about 
this small village in what is known as China (I can&#146;t pronounce the 
Chinese name, but it&#146;s dream counterpart in the Realm of Dreams is 
called &#147;The Dreaming Continent&#148; in common) there&#146;s a legend of this 
mystical &#147;ring&#148;.&#148;

Keiko spins on her heels, whipping her blade about fully to catch her 
opponent midriff, ripping into him splattering his &#147;blood&#148; everywhere. 
Since he was a Darkling this was a fatal blow, it would not resurrect 
or &#147;wake up&#148; from this. It was for all intents and purposes quite 
&#147;dead&#148; once the blade impacted and went through it.

&#147;This &#147;ring&#148;, not like the legendary &#147;one ring&#148; of LotR fame, was not 
really a ring at all but some sort of crystal paperweight thingee. 
Anyway, it&#146;s said that whoever can see the light within this &#147;ring&#148; 
will be blessed by a guardian angel--- the spirit of the moon if you 
will--- who will protect them from harm.&#148;

As the Darkling drops, it&#146;s body disintegrating, something shiny 
catches Keiko&#146;s attention.

&#147;But then again, before today, I would have told you that whoever came 
up with that concept was probably on crack or something stronger---&#148;

Keiko scoops up the object and looks at it. &#147;Eck? Why did it swallow 
this crystal paperweight? (Strange thing to find after gutting 
something like that).&#148;

&#147;---then again that was before all this happened. And believe me--- I 
wish it hadn&#146;t happened.&#148;

(Note - This is an alternate &#147;Elseworlds&#148; style fiction and doesn&#146;t 
reflect Yamanaka&#146;s current role in Card Captor Sakura Remastered)

------

Keiko feels the weight of her day weighing down on her as she slowly 
trudges up the stairs to her apartment. &#147;For god&#146;s sake why don&#146;t they 
ever fix the damn elevator--- eh?&#148;

Something was sticking out of her door&#146;s mail slot as she reached her 
floor. &#147;Better not be junk mail--- last thing I need right now---&#148; 
(bends over and picks it up) &#147;---it&#146;s from Nina.&#148;

Inside the envelope is a holo-postcard which Keiko sets to play while 
she washes the strange crystal object she picked up earlier in the 
sink. &#147;I&#146;m in lockdown again with the gang! Sure it&#146;s for Spider-Man 
but I bet we&#146;ll be here for months past that. You know these things, 
they last forever!&#148;

&#147;Duh.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re about to see Star Wars Episode II which is cool. They&#146;re 
finally inaugurating ti and that took this side of forever! I mean, 
all the waiting! I think I nailed Eliza in every part of this complex 
by now with all the time we had and such!&#148;

&#147;Wouldn&#146;t doubt it---&#148; (holds crystal up) &#147;---just about clean---&#148; 
(sits down on couch drying the crystal with a towel as she listens and 
watches the images from the card).

&#147;Been doing this snazzy review thing for this dandy view called &#147;Die 
Anime Girl!&#148; (It&#146;s really up there stuff, you have to see it to 
believe it! Love my work on it, I think it&#146;s my best to date!) Well, 
that&#146;s that. The movie is starting soon. So take care and do something 
about that abysmal thing you call &#147;life&#148;.&#148;

&#147;Jerk---&#148; (sighs) &#147;---just because I&#146;m not doing it 24/7 like a crazed 
animal doesn&#146;t mean I don&#146;t have a comfortably healthy---&#148; (?) &#147;---I 
thought I cleaned this stupid thing!&#148; (shakes it abit) &#147;---can&#146;t be 
blood, it&#146;s too black even for Darkling blood, and it doesn&#146;t feel 
like there&#146;s liquid in it---&#148; (?) &#147;---there&#146;s reflected light---&#148; 
(looks up) &#147;---but the lighting is facing the wrong direction to 
reflect into---&#148;

The light grows stronger, and brighter, until it reflects a strange 
long haired woman in stranger robes inside the crystal. &#147;YEOUCH!!&#148; 
(Keiko tosses the ring away, jumping back abit (which doesn&#146;t get her 
far because she was already sitting down on her couch when she tried 
to push herself backwards)).

The very woman she saw in the crystal forms before her.

&#147;Greetings,. Master.&#148;

(blank expression) &#147;----&#148; (blinks) &#147;----eh?&#148;

&#147;Are you OK, Master?&#148;

&#147;---&#148; (draws closer) &#147;You&#146;ve seen far too much I Dream of Jeanie, 
haven&#146;t you.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Never mind.&#148; (Keiko stands up working off the kinks of her earlier 
shock (trying to look cool as she does this) while pacing about the 
strange newcomer). &#147;Uh---hi?&#148;

&#147;Salutations.&#148;

&#147;---?---&#148;

&#147;I am the Guardian Angel Shao Lin.&#148;

&#147;---&#148; (looks out window) &#147;---shouldn&#146;t you be in cherub form or 
something? It&#146;s dark outside.&#148; (no reaction) &#147;Guess not. So----&#148; 
(stops, regards her words for a second) &#147;---you&#146;re a Guardian Angel, 
eh?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;What does---&#148;

&#147;It means like the Moon in the sky. I accompany my Master and protect 
you. My name is Shao Lin. Please call me Shao.&#148;

Keiko takes Shao by the arm and leads her to the balcony outside of 
her apartment. &#147;Look up.&#148;

Shao does as she is told.

&#147;See the moon?&#148;

&#147;No. Is it a new moon out---&#148;

&#147;There is NO moon. This is the Realm of Dreams. (Lunaris, the Dream 
Moon, stays in light orbit facing &#147;Elsespace&#148; so it&#146;s not visible at 
night.)&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Never mind--- you just stand there and let me know the instant you 
see the moon. Alright?&#148; Keiko turns and walks back inside, &#147;Have a 
nice life.&#148; (locks the door tight) &#147;Nice kid. No brains since she 
could stand out there all night and not see Lunaris. Heck, she&#146;d 
probably starve to death out there--- or end up a cast member in 
Showgirls 2--- or both (given her dumb luck I&#145;d opt for both).&#148;

&#147;Master, what is you---&#148;

&#147;ACK!!&#148; (Keiko spins about to find Shao behind her (inside the 
apartment)) &#147;Didn&#146;t I just---!!&#148;

&#147;Master, what is your name?&#148;

&#147;But I---I--- I locked you outside and---&#148; (stops) &#147;Keiko Yamanaka. 
Does it matter?&#148;

(This conversation is a bit awkward)

&#147;Your telling me.&#148; Keiko remarks blandly.

&#147;That&#146;s such a beautiful name. (And who are you speaking to?)&#148;

&#147;---thanks--- (and ignore me, I&#146;m just talking to the narrator).&#148;

&#147;?&#148;

&#147;Ahem---&#148; (changes subject) &#147;Thanks. I&#146;d compliment my parents on your 
compliment on their selection of my name mind you but for the fact 
they&#146;re---&#148;

&#147;Dead?&#148; (at this point Keiko grabs Shao and just moves her to the 
couch to sit her down) &#147;No, they moved to Florida to play golf, drink 
Florida Premium Orange Juice and hang around Disneyworld with the rest 
of the walking damned. OF COURSE THEY&#146;RE DEAD!!&#148;

&#147;Is Disney world a place of the damned? Are there souls in torment in 
Disneyworld?&#148;

&#147;Only if your dumb enough to actually visit. Though mind you it&#145;s not 
as bad as the hell known as EuroDisney or Tokyo Disney---&#148; (sighs) 
&#147;What&#146;s your point?&#148;

&#147;Master Keiko Yamanaka---&#148;

&#147;Keiko.&#148;

&#147;---from now on, no matter what happens--- I will protect you.&#148;

At this point Keiko didn&#146;t know whether to laugh, or laugh until her 
lungs froze and she began to choke from the extreme seizures from 
laughing too hard. &#147;---say what---?&#148; (Keiko&#146;s thoughts) &#145;Don&#146;t laugh, 
don&#146;t laugh, keep a straight face, don&#146;t laugh--- don&#146;t laugh--- think 
about something else--- think about The Rock in the Scorpion--- hell, 
no, I&#146;d never stop laughing at that rate---&#146;

&#147;Uhm--- you really don&#146;t need to---&#148;

&#147;This house seems to have so little security.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s an apartment. And I do just---&#148;

&#147;And that must be the doorway.&#148;

Keiko looks on in disbelief. &#147;Yeah, right. Why don&#146;t you let yourself 
out while your at it. I&#145;m sure the alley cats can put you up for the 
night--- they need a singing companion out there.&#148; (sighs) &#147;What the 
hell---&#148; (a few minutes and a quick link to cyberspace yields 
information on the subject).

GUARDIAN ANGEL PROJECT

Waking Century 13th (time relative to normal time)

Goal - Create &#147;Guardian&#148; type breeding combining angel/dreaming DNA.

Subjects - Shao Lin (Original/Angel) (Chinese peasant girl ascended to 
Angel, predating first known Angel of Gender (male or female) (Joan of 
Ark))

Chandler Lazarus (deceased human, passed over to heaven, defected to 
Realm of Dreams).

Both defected to be together (married 1275WWT (Waking World 
Timeline)).

With proper spells two became sexually capable of breeding children 
together.

First daughter (Shao Lin the 1st) became guardian angel prototype.

11 more Guardian Angels were born (bringing about the birth of the 
Guardian class of protectorate in 1375) before project was scrapped. 
Reason - Unknown.

Original 13 Shao Lins are still &#147;alive&#148; to today, as well as mates, 
offspring and relations.

However, rumors persist of a 13th Shao Lin. File follows.

Shao Lin the 13th - Born from the rape of Shao Lin the 7th by the 
Darke Raven (Calistro, 15th Century). Shao Lin the 13th is to date the 
only Shao Lin born between light and darkness.

Present whereabouts and status of Shao Lin the 13th - Unknown.

-------

&#145;Is she the 13th Shao Lin then?&#146; Keiko&#146;s thoughts are a jumble as she 
lets the information sink in. &#145;12 Shao Lins. Then along comes a 
13th--- born between light &amp; darkness. Could this be---&#146;

&#147;Master Yamanaka---&#148;

&#147;Keiko. And why are you still here?&#148;

&#147;Now you&#146;re safe!&#148;

&#147;That&#145;s nice--- go away.&#148;

&#147;I have booby trapped the entrance!&#148;

&#147;Yeah, yeah. Thanks---&#147; (takes a few seconds for it to sink in) 
&#147;---YOU WHAT?!?&#148;

(sound of cannon fire and chaos outside) &#147;Looks like we caught one!&#148;

&#147;What--- the--- hell---?&#148; (finds two strange things sitting on a 
cannon guarding her front door)

&#147;That is Shaki. I can bring out traditional Chinese Zodiac spirits 
from the Shitenrin.&#148;

&#147;The what?&#148; (Shao Lin points at the paperweight) &#147;Oh---&#148;

A little more typing (while still linked reveals----

SHAKI - A CHINESE ZODIAC RELATED TO THE WOLF SIGN.

&#147;I have ordered them to attack anyone who does not live---&#148; (Keiko 
picks the little creatures up and glares at them) &#147;Do that again and 
I&#146;ll see if either of you tastes like CHICKEN!!&#148;

The two look as if she&#146;s kidding, only to stop, realize she&#146;s NOT 
kidding, then disappear, and takes their weapon with them. &#147;Eh?&#148; (Shao 
Lin looks about quite disturbed) &#147;I didn&#146;t ask them to leave.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m asking, though. So pack up your troubles (and mine while your at 
it) and---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll go secure the next room.&#148; (she disappears into the bathroom)

&#147;---well, I have had some troubles with voyeurs filming me 
showering--- (maybe she&#146;ll kill them).&#148;

------

&#147;Are you still here?&#148; Keiko sighed, exasperated with the whole 
situation.

&#147;Yes. What can I---&#148;

&#147;You can drop dead.&#148;

&#147;Anything else, Master Yamanaka?&#148;

&#147;Keiko--- never mind. Stop calling me master before I decide to make 
you my pet you---&#148; (Keiko sighs as she rifles through the channels 
trying not to think about her troubles. Clearly Command wouldn&#146;t be of 
much else at this moment either.)

------

Earlier (and one call to Command Tokyo)

&#147;You&#146;ve got to be kidding me!&#148;Keiko huffed, looking at the screen with 
a stern expression, &#147;She could be Britney f-ing Spears for all I care! 
I&#146;m NOT hosting her in MY APARTMENT! No way!&#148;

&#147;Guardian Angels for the most part keep a extremely low profile. It&#146;s 
hard to find one these days. This one being so open about her status 
and seemingly employing dark magic as you noted is a significant sign 
that she must be the 13th Shao Lin.&#148;

&#147;And that&#146;s important because---&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s a daughter of a Darke Raven. The power she must wield must be 
enormous! We need to know more about her, and the kind of power 
potential she has. So, for the time being, we want you to keep her at 
your place until you gain her trust, then---&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s no problem. It&#146;s her gaining my trust---&#148;

&#147;---just until we can find a way to have her tested and trained to see 
her full potential. Besides which, you&#146;ll be a positive role model for 
her! After all Guardian Angel types only come out for pure souls and 
you must have a soul as pure as snow!&#148;

&#147;Or she&#146;s just bored and I was the first sucker she saw.&#148;

&#147;Doesn&#146;t work that way. Look, just keep her in there and we&#146;ll do the 
rest. Command, out.&#148;

If it would have helped, Keiko could have put the screen out with her 
fist--- but since she would just have to replace it anyway (and have 
to communicate with them in any case) she left the screen be.

She went to her couch and started watching TV with a vengeance just to 
work off the stress.

That&#146;s when she returned from her venture into the bathroom to secure 
it.

And where we are at present with this situation.

------

&#147;What the hell do they know anyway, bunch of paper pushing idiots---&#148; 
(sighs as she tries to look around her new &#147;house guest&#148;) &#147;Hey! Down 
in front! I&#145;m watching TV here!&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s this?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s called a TV. Now sit here and watch the idiot box with me--- do 
something useful at least.&#148;

For the longest time she sits there transfixed by what she sees, 
though she was still in front of Keiko and hadn&#146;t moved to the spot 
next to her yet. This gives Keiko a little time to think. &#145;Why am I 
bitching her out? She can&#146;t help being stupid, she&#146;s the product of a 
ridiculous century after all---- still---&#146; (steals a peek at her face) 
&#145;---she is kinda cute. And I really haven&#146;t had a significant other in 
a long time---&#146;

&#147;Oh! There&#146;s a dog!&#148;

Keiko shuffles herself in her seat, feeling herself get a little 
excited by her excitement. &#145;Speaking of dogs I feel like one in 
heat--- dammit--- I&#146;m getting hyped and I couldn&#145;t stand her one 
minute ago! I can&#146;t stand her one minute and the next I want--- oh no, 
not going there!&#146; (closes eyes) &#145;Not going there! Not going there! 
Just NOT GOING THERE!&#146;

&#147;Wow! And a man!&#148;

Keiko frowns inwardly, &#145;---great, she&#146;s straight--- killjoy.&#146;

&#147;It must be so crowded in the box for a man and a dog to be in it.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s just an image. An illusion for entertainment. A picture show if 
you will---&#148;

But Shao Lin is too transfixed by the show to listen.

&#145;And she does have a nice---&#146; (closes eyes tight and curses herself) 
&#145;---I knew I never should have added the Spice Channel to my service 
last month!! Damn I&#146;m a sucker for bargains!!&#146;

&#147;MASTER YAMANAKA! HE&#146;S A BAD MAN!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s Keiko. For the last time my name---&#148;

&#147;Master Yamanaka! Run! If he shoots that Tensha, you could be---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll &#147;disarm&#148; him then---&#148; (holds up remote) &#147;---no pro---&#148;

&#147;LOOK OUT MASTER YAMANAKA!!&#148; (she pushes Keiko down onto the ground, 
flipping the couch over in the process (she was in a panic and really 
overdid it))

For the longest time (by Keiko&#146;s reckoning) they just lie there still 
and quiet. As they lie there Keiko shuts her eyes, grits her teeth, 
and whispers one thing. &#147;Dammit.&#148;

Her arms wraps around Shao Lin, squeezing her, relishing this close 
intimate contact.

&#145;Goddess I feel so old!&#146; Keiko yells at herself in her thoughts, &#145;Like 
some desperate pervert who can&#146;t stand not having some! SO WHAT?! It&#146;s 
been 4 years since she died--- I can&#146;t stop thinking about it but--- I 
don&#146;t want to be--- I need something--- make me feel---&#146; (looks into 
Shao Lin&#146;s eyes) &#145;---like I&#146;m a woman again. It&#146;s my life so why can&#146;t 
I get over it--- move on--- fall in love---&#146;

By now she pulls herself up, looking at Keiko. &#147;Are you OK?&#148;

&#147;---no---&#148; (her hand reaches up and gently cups Shao Lin&#146;s face as she 
stares into her eyes) &#147;---I---&#148;

&#147;SANDY!!&#148; (Shao Lin&#146;s attention has spun back to the TV).

Keiko faints (which wasn&#145;t too hard since she was already flat on her 
back).

&#147;Master Yamanaka! Sandy got that bad man!&#148;

&#147;---hooray---&#148;

&#147;I must give Sandy a treat!&#148;

Keiko rolls over face down and sighs. &#147;Weird Al was right. The signs 
of Jupiter does indicate I&#146;ll be spending this entire week with my 
face down in the mud--- sorta.&#148;

&#147;Master, may I have the sweets here?&#148;

&#147;Help yourself. And it&#146;s Keiko. Just Keiko---&#148;(sighs) &#147;---whatever. 
Have fun&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s strange. Where did Sandy go?&#148; (commercial break, but 
regardless, Keiko had enough &#147;entertainment&#148; for the time being). &#147;If 
you need me I&#146;ll be drowning myself in the bath.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s a good way to drown your sorrows away, Master.&#148;

&#147;No, I meant LITTERLY drowning myself--- if that was possible which it 
doesn&#146;t seem to be ever since I had that aquatic breathing spell cast 
on me in 1745 which never seemed to wear off--- whatever.&#148;

Keiko leaves her &#147;guest&#148; behind, waiting patiently for Sandy to return 
for her treat. Seconds later, &#147;Here, Sandy. It&#146;s a treat. It&#146;s 
actually my Master&#146;s, but---&#148;

Just as well. She was trying to give Sandy chocolate.

------

Sure enough, three attempts at self drowning leads nowhere. She did 
learn one thing though from her experimental suicide attempt. (&#147;So 
that&#146;s what fluoridated water smells like.&#148;)

As she lies back in the tub, splashing the water absentmindedly, her 
thought vocalize as she ponders her present situation. &#147;Figures. If it 
didn&#146;t work four years ago, it won&#146;t work now (and I threw myself into 
Tokyo Harbor too).&#148; (Keiko traces a few lines in the water as she 
soaks) &#147;---goddess, I wanted her so badly I couldn&#146;t think. I just 
wanted to hold her--- kiss her--- goddess---&#148; (shakes head) &#147;---Nina&#146;s 
right, I need a legit girlfriend. At least a serious full time lover 
before I end up driving myself crazy with this strange guardian girl. 
I mean, I can&#146;t have her. She&#146;s too out there to even consider 
starting a relationship with, and what do I tell her? &#145;Oh by the way 
I&#146;m a lesbian and I&#146;m feeling like experimenting with you because I 
haven&#146;t been with someone in a few years and you look like quality sex 
partner material?&#146; Eck. That&#146;s a sure way to drive her away---&#148; (even 
her remote controlled boat didn&#146;t make her happy as it sputtered about 
the bath) &#147;What&#146;d she say if she was here right now&#148;

&#147;Master Yamanaka.&#148;

&#147;Yeah. She&#146;d start with that but that&#146;s a given. What else---&#148; (stops) 
&#147;---oh no.&#148; (huffs her breath) &#147;Don&#146;t you know it&#146;s impolite to 
teleport into somewhere without---&#148; (stops) &#147;---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s dangerous for you to bathe alone.&#148;

&#147;---you can&#146;t be serious---&#148; (face freezes in place despite the fact 
she can&#146;t see much yet since Shao was obscured by the smoke of the 
teleport spell) &#147;---are you trying to get in her naked?!? Are you---&#148;

She&#146;s wearing a bathing suit. Keiko almost faints from shock, but 
somehow doesn&#146;t.

&#147;When your bathing your not armed! You&#146;re an ideal target for ass---&#148;

&#147;Katana.&#148; (holds up sword she usually keeps at the side of the bath, 
then swivels over and clicks open a secret compartment in the side 
wall) &#147;Glock (the infamous &#147;plastic gun&#147; though it&#145;s not completely 
plastic because the damn thing would shatter under heavy usage if it 
was all plastic), Desert Eagle (Israel model, my favorite), Smith &amp; 
Wesson, Globek pulse gun (24th Century).&#148;

&#147;Oh. Your well---&#148; (Keiko reaches out and touches her arm) &#147;Bathe with 
me anyway?&#148;

&#147;But---&#148;

&#147;Not to protect me--- just because?&#148;

She steps into the tub, only to find herself holding Keiko as she lays 
her head against the girl&#146;s chest and closes her eyes. &#147;Just hold 
me--- and don&#145;t say a word.&#148;

The rest of the bath is spent in her arms, resting silently against 
her as she enjoys the brief warmth of their bodies together wondering 
why she wanted to be this close to her--- yet no answer comes to her.

Maybe later--- but, for now, just being in her arms held this close 
was enough.

------

Keiko wakes to find herself flat on her back on her couch, dressed 
once again.

&#147;----eh---?&#148; (looks about, only to find Shao Lin staring at her). &#145;Is 
she really trying to save me?&#146; Keiko&#146;s thought roll on the subject as 
she stares as Shao Lin, &#146;I know people want me dead, but not this 
badly. I feel sorta bad leaving her dangling like this---&#146; (Keiko 
sighs inwardly) &#145;---but I might as well level with her and get it over 
with. Command will have to pick her up prematurely and deal with her 
themselves.&#146;

&#147;Uh--- Shao Lin? My life really isn&#146;t as dangerous as you think. Sure 
it&#146;s dangerous but that&#146;s part of my job. It&#146;s just that--- well, 
people ARE trying to kill me--- just they never get very far with 
those plans so I am usually very safe at home, and at work for the 
most part. I have no real enemies and the few I do have would probably 
kill you to get at me so I&#146;d rather not see you get butchered or worst 
because of me---&#148; (gulps) &#147;---so--- what I mean is--- I---&#148;

&#147;I see.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry. I just---&#148;

&#147;Then I must be an inconvenience.&#148;

&#147;Well--- no--- that&#146;s not what I meant---&#148;

&#147;I understand. Please forgive me for my inadequacy. I shall return to 
the Shitenrin, and one day I shall meet another person with a pure 
heart.&#148;

And, like that, she was gone back into the crystal.

&#147;---well, I&#146;m dead.&#148; Keiko laments. &#147;Command&#146;ll never understand why I 
ended up chasing her back into her pocket dimension.&#148; (laughs 
nervously) &#147;---what&#146;s the worst they can do? Talk about censuring me 
AGAIN? Heh. That&#146;d never stick anyway so it&#146;s not like I care--- 
still--- &#147; (holds crystal up and looks into it) &#147;---I wish she could 
have stood for dinner. Not fair--- but---&#148; (touches cheek that only a 
few minutes ago rested upon her bosom) &#147;---I wish I got to know her 
better. Maybe--- she could have been the one---&#148;

Are you lonely?

&#147;Damn. I&#146;m hearing voices--- heh. Par for the course I guess---&#148;

Are you lonely?

For the longest time Keiko says nothing, just sitting there staring 
into the ring--- then, finally.

&#147;---yeah---&#148;

With a final sigh, Keiko puts the crystal down and rolls over on the 
couch, closing her eyes.

&#147;Master Yamanaka.&#148;

&#147;Keiko. Keiko. Keiko.&#148; (Keiko grumbles as she closes her eyes) &#147;At 
least call me Kei---&#148; (spins around shocked) &#147;---Shao?&#148;

She kneels down, and touches Keiko&#146;s cheek with her open palm, smiling 
in a different way than her usual grin as she does. This time she 
smiled a genuinely affectionate smile. &#147;If it&#146;s not a problem--- I&#146;d 
like to protect you--- would that--- be a problem?&#148; Keiko returns the 
touch, carefully reaches her hand up to cup Shao&#146;s face in turn, 
listening as Shao Lin continues to speak, &#147;I don&#146;t know this place, 
but I would like to stay with you. I don&#146;t know how to protect you 
from being alone--- but I want to try--- if you&#146;d let me.&#148;

With that Keiko closes her eyes, and smiles a genuinely warming and 
heartfelt smile (the first since she met Shao). &#147;I want to protect you 
too--- my heart and yours---&#148; (Keiko is really on a high cloud nine 
now so she has no clue what she&#146;s saying, she&#146;s just ad-libbing as she 
goes). &#147;---stay with me--- my love.&#148;

&#147;Love?&#148;

&#147;Be my lover--- please? Love me---&#148;

&#147;Thank you!&#148; Shao Lin cries out, looking happy beyond belief.

As they stare at each other, the endless possibilities and moments 
that they could share together open before them, and something 
beautiful starts to form from what seemed a very awkward situation.

Shao Lin leaps on top of Keiko (knocking the wind out of her) as she 
cuddles close to her new lover. &#147;I&#146;M YOUR LOVER!! I&#145;ll protect your 
heart forever!&#148;

&#147;---eck--- you can say that again---&#148;

&#147;I&#146;M YOUR LOVER!! I&#145;ll protect your heart forever!&#148;

&#147;----&#148; (thinks to self) &#145;Note to self--- housetrain new lover ASAP.&#146;

------

&#147;What was I thinking?! Sure she&#146;s cute, and has cuddly breasts, and 
nice legs--- but for god&#146;s sake her first act of love nearly broke my 
arm and a few ribs!&#148; (overexaggerating a bit aren&#146;t we, Keiko?)

&#147;Still, if I can live through all the years as a Judgment, I can 
survive this relationship--- maybe.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m just not too anxious to find out what sex&#146;ll be like with her--- 
one shock at a time.&#148;

------

Shao Lin - &#147;When is Sandy coming back?&#148;

Keiko - &#147;Same time tomorrow, same Sandy time, same Sandy channel.&#148; 
(groans)

Shao Lin - &#147;Where did they go? Who are these people and why are they 
yelling?&#148;

Keiko - &#147;It&#146;s a game show.&#148;

Shao Lin - &#147;What kind of game? Can we play? What&#145;ll we get if we win? 
What are the rules? Why aren&#145;t they waiting for us to answer? Is Sandy 
with them? Will they remember to feed Sandy before bed?&#148;

Keiko - &#147;----&#148;

Future of Guardian Angel Remastered? - What future? You know how 
expensive Raijin Comics is on a budget (and I already expend $60-up 
dollars a month reporting on TOKYOPOP)! I&#146;d say the future is nil, and 
most of you might even be thankful for that. Still, if anyone actually 
liked reading this (doubt it) if I ever get another Raijin Comics I 
might revisit this Remastered thread--- maybe.
