<h1>The Devil's Job</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kickass.html">Kickass_Kfu</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Through a huge mansion, at exactly 2:19 am in the morning, upon a 
reclusive hill. No lights were on, not that anyone could see anyways. 
Through and through all the big dark halls.  Quiet sounds running 
throughout the abode only meant something else.

* Slish*

Crimson

A butcher knife right into the shoulder.

A stupid butcher knife wasn&#39;t going to stop this...

/just stop running/

Slamming into walls

/it would make this easier on the both of us/

Lead right into a dead end

/here we go again/

&quot;PLEASE DON&#39;T KILL ME!! PLEASE, OH GOD! OH GOD DON&#39;T KILL ME! I&#39;LL DO 
ANYTHING!!&quot;

BAM!

There was always the three seconds silence that makes the victim finally 
figure out that they just ate a bullet to their forehead. Right after 
this, they fall to the ground, most dieing before they hit the ground. 
Making the heavy &quot;thud&quot; sound, like when you drop a bowling ball on the 
ground, except with crimson liquid gushing out of it while falling and 
hitting the ground. 

The shooter just looked at the body, emotion drained from their face. 
Putting down the Colt Diamond Back.  But the shooter never took its eyes 
off the body. The last thing they felt was total terror

Totally Vulnerable

No control

Pissing pants chaos

The dark figure in the shadows turned its back and began to walk away. A 
proper funeral was to be taken; the body would be found, people would 
mourn, blah blah and more blah.

Who honestly cared anymore?

Certainly not the shooter.

Walking through the dark chilly hallways, the shooter passed the only 
large window. Red eyes gleamed toward the crescent moon.

&quot;Yet one step closer&quot;

Was all that slipped through their lips, before the shooter finally 
disappeared into the shadows, Letting the darkness consume them, no one 
would find out who they were.

They never did.


&quot;DAD! YOU&#39;RE KIDDING ME!&quot;

&quot;Afraid not sweetie&quot;

&quot;But, I know you&#39;re rich and famous and everything, but...this is abit 
extreme&quot; The girl tried to comprehend what was going on. The man sighed 
and looked up at his daughter who was standing over him while he sat in 
the chair trying to read a newspaper. She was taller then average (but 
only by an inch), fair skin, long, silk like reddish/brown hair. Today 
she was adorning her simple school uniform. But her face was full of 
surprise.

&quot;But dad, getting a...a...&quot;

&quot;A body guard? Not extreme sweetie, I&#39;m just taking extra precautions 
for your safety.&quot; He spoke casually. The girl stood still for a moment 
/wow, a bodyguard? I feel like a CELEBRITY!/ the girl joyously played in 
her mind about Justin Timberlake, Paris Hilton, Johnny Depp and 
countless others.

&quot;you know that this man will have to follow you around everywhere 
right?&quot;

&quot;I know, I know&quot; she dreamily passed away her fathers advice. He sighed, 
knowing that this was his daughters &quot;LaLa land&quot; faze. He decided to snap 
her out of it quickly.

&quot;Natalie&quot; He began... but her eyes were swoon to La La land. He breathed 
in again.

&quot;I HAVE AN INTERVIEW WITH JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE!&quot; he shouted. 

&quot;JL??? REALLY....juuuuussssstttttiiiinnnnnnn&quot; she moaned his name, sending 
herself deeper into La La land. The man shook his head in 
disappointment, but wordlessly tried again.

&quot;ANGLINA JOLIE WILL BE MAKING AN APPOINTMENT TODAY WITH ME!&quot;

&quot;AJ?? Annnnnggggggglllllliiiinaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot; she moaned her name as she 
went back to La La land thinking deeply about tomb raider, Dark angel. 
The man nearly slapped himself, but decided to take the &quot;third times a 
charm&quot; adage. 

&quot;I CAN SEE YOUR HELLO KITTY PANTIES!!&quot;

&quot;-WHAT?? REALLY?? NOOOOO!!!!&quot; she screeched, covering her thighs , 
crossing her arms frantically.  Hopping backwards, her sky blue eyes as 
big as dinner plates. Finally it all hit her, &quot;wait, my skirt is right 
above my knee&#39;s...&quot; Her father&#39;s laughter rang in her ears, which where 
quickly turning red as she turned her head sharply to her father was 
literally slamming his fist down on the table in laughter.

&quot;YOU DIRTY OLD MAN! THAT WAS A MEAN TRICK!!&quot;

He only laughed harder, the &quot;hello kitty&quot; panties worked EVERY time. She 
grabbed her book bag hastily, growling &quot;so when do I meet this man?&quot; 
finally her fathers laughter died down, her managed to get a simple 
answer out of his sore cheeks &quot;Tonight dear, don&#39;t worry, I only hired 
the best for you...&quot; He looked sincerely into her eyes...right before he 
burst out into uncontrollable laughter.

&quot;OH GROW UP!!&quot; she shouted angrily, her face flushing a deep red. As she 
began to stomp towards the door. Feeling more anger since her fathers 
just hooted in response.

&quot;I HOPE YOU CHOKE TO DEATH!&quot; she shouted before slamming the door.

&quot;I would die a happy man then&quot; he chuckled, wiping his eyes.


Natalie huffed out a breath, walking toward the limo in the long drive 
way. Her father was such a weirdo, and just LOVED to tease her about her 
hello kitty panties. &quot;Where to ma&#39;am?&quot; The chauffeur asked. She sighed 
then growled &quot;you know where&quot;

&quot;school then?&quot;

&quot;what do you think?&quot;


The lady just sighed, /what a brat/ she thought. &quot;Ok then&quot; She started 
the car, beginning to feel the car move.  Natalie stared out the window, 
welcome to the big metropolis known a Los Angeles. Where all the rich 
and famous lived... to her, it was just another day.

&quot;Stop here&quot; she commanded. The chauffeur obeyed, though she never got 
why, she always wanted to be dropped off four blocks from her school. It 
didn&#39;t make any sense.

&quot;Have a good day&quot;

&quot;what ever&quot; Natalie brushed off her comment, she was just another weird 
employee, like this bodyguard that was coming in. She hopped out of the 
car as quickly as possible and began to walk toward her school. IT was a 
prestigious all-girls school in a remote earthier place, away from the 
big city. Truth was, her chauffeur didn&#39;t know that it was actually four 
blocks to the BUS STOP, then another 15 minutes to get to the school.


Natalie liked to do this because, it made her feel more normal, not like 
one of the rich and famous. Plus it was a lot more exciting that  way, 
you could actually see out the windows and look around, rather look 
through the ugly purple tint of the limo. Sure she was the most popular 
girl at school, but everyone knowing the limo, and the huge mansion, and 
THEN the bodyguard? It would be way too much.

She was closing in on star bucks, hmm she was early, a frap chino was 
calling her. She began to swerve toward the front door, until she felt 
an intense gaze on her. Immediately she turned her head toward the gaze. 
Tall, around 5&#39;8 ish, baggy black pants. A long pea coat, with some 
heavy-duty combat boots. Though covering the head was a pretty big biker 
helmet. The plastic was tinted deep purple, impossible to see any sort 
of facial features. The figure it self sat lazily on a simple thing that 
looked A LOT like a motorcycle. IT was looking directly at her, an 
extremely creepy vibe came over Natalie, she swerved out of the way from 
Star bucks continuing her way realizing that Coffee wasn&#39;t that 
important today.


/so that&#39;s the one/


Natalie could still feel the gaze upon her, she began to walk faster

/Ok, creepy person is still looking at me/ she thought

, then go into a slight jog.

/what if this is another one of those stalkers? /

She felt her feet begin to pick up a pace

/I&#39;m just being paranoid, stop feeling so nervous/

Her heart began to race as well

/AHHH!! STOP I SAY! STOP! Look no one is looking at me--/

As Natalie turned around to see if the figure was still staring at her&#151;

KABAM!!


Her head collided right into a pole, her body just fell like a cinder 
block. She shook off the pain on her upper lip and nose as she scrambled 
up and just sprinted. Never looking back.  The person calmly looked at 
the young girl running away with blood streaming out behind her, making 
an air trail (she looked like a total fool). But then walked over to the 
ground where she fell on, and observed the object on the ground.


Natalie finally panted to a stop as she leaned against the bus stop. She 
whipped her face off from sweat, only to shriek when she saw blood. 
Apparently her nose had stopped bleeding but left an awkward trail down 
her face (she made sure to wipe off all of it). But blood just made her 
feel sick. She rode the bus pretty care freely, but in the back of her 
head still remained of that same image...

CREEPY BIKER MAN!!  The note wrote in huge letters, the blonde haired 
girl looked at it with an amusing smile. Then quickly wrote back on the 
small piece of paper, {are you serious? Creepy Biker man?} She then 
skidded it across the floor without the middle-aged teacher looking. 
Natalie got back the paper and without a second thought began to 
scribble down on it furiously. {I am damn serious, this is the most 
creepy biker dude EVER!} she then drew an extremely crude picture of a 
stick figure with a way too big helmet that looked more like a sawed off 
bowling ball then a helmet. Average height, blonde, fair skin, green 
eyes, and Natalie&#39;s right-hand girl in crime; sniggered at the drawing. 
Natalie smirked seeing her snigger, she propped her feet onto her desk, 
totally ignoring the teachers long lecture on something /I&#39;m just glad 
I&#39;m away from that person--/ Natalie&#39;s eyes finally wandered to the 
front of the room...

&quot;CREEPY BIKER MAN AHHHHHHHHH!!!&quot; 

swwwIIIIPPPPPP!

&quot;AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!&quot;

CRASH! BAM!!

&quot;AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!&quot;

THUD!! WAAAAKK!

&quot;WAHHHHHH!!&quot;


Well, screaming, then falling in the most idiotic way out of your chair 
and STILL screaming on top of your lungs when everything came crashing 
down on top of you wasn&#39;t a very good way to start off the day. Flaying 
her arms on top of her face, her legs in an odd splayed out position, 
with her desk in complete disarray was when Natalie finally snapped back 
into reality. Everyone&#39;s eyes was glued onto her, Natalie looked around 
cluelessly for a few seconds then got up, wiping off dust from her 
clothes.

&quot;well what are you all looking at?&quot; she growled, trying to be as poised 
as possible, putting her desk and chair back up in position. Then 
sitting back down unfortunately all the girls were still staring at her 
wide mouthed, a few pieces of gum even fell out and onto the floor. The 
teacher coughed and began again.

&quot;Well class, despite the DISRUPTION-&quot;

&quot;are you looking at ME Mrs. nor stein? IF you are I can assure you that 
there were Plenty of other disruptions FAR more disturbing then MINE&quot; 
Natalie said curtly, getting plenty of sniggers from the class room; 
though truth was, she was trying to forget the fact that there was the 
creepy biker man standing RIGHT in her class room. The teacher just 
rolled her eyes and continued, &quot;I have hired a  teachers aid to help me 
and the other teachers around school, everyone please welcome....&quot;

&quot;....&quot;


&quot;....&quot;


&quot;err, can you introduce yourself?&quot; The teacher asked finally after a few 
seconds.  The Creepy biker man took out something, not actually 
something&#39;s from his pocket. Something small and square, the other thin 
and white... With a quick flick with the same hand, the tip of the thin 
white object lit afire, while the square metal object dropped back into 
his pocket. Then holding it, he pointed at Natalie

&quot;girl&quot;

&quot;...&quot;


&quot;what?&quot; the teacher asked, then began, &quot;this is an all girl school of 
course she&#39;s a-&quot;

&quot;No, I know that, she said Creepy biker man, Its actually-,&quot; The creepy 
biker man took off the helmet with one hand revealing a young, feminine 
face, pink pale lips, hawk like eyes, and an oval head. But by far the 
most peculiar feature was the jet white hair, thick, short(not super 
short) and absolutely wild; but also the marble like eyes, so pale they 
looked like a bluish milky mixture of a cornea, with a black dot in the 
middle.

&quot;Creepy biker girl&quot;

With that, the creepy biker GIRL  took a long drag on he cigarette, 
blowing a steam of smoke, staring at Natalie with those hawk like eyes. 
Natalie felt her stomach do a handstand. /absolutely creepy still/ she 
thought. Her teacher coughed at the sudden smoke in the room.. &quot;You know 
that that MUST be put out if on school grounds, anyhow, what is your 
name and say something about yourself&quot; .

&quot;....My name is Oren....Don&#39;t ask for my first name... I&#39;m 18...and I&#39;m 
apparently a creepy biker girl&quot;  her voice was deep and dry, it so 
seemed with her humor as well. She earned some snickers at this...after a 
few seconds of silence the teacher prodded her again.

&quot;so what do you like then?&quot;

&quot;.... I like smoking&quot; Oren replied. 

&quot;What a freak&quot; Kat whispered to her friend, unfortunately for Kat, she 
sat in the front row, and unfortunately for Kat, Oren stretched out her 
arm and burned out her cigarette right in the middle of her forehead, 
and unfortunately for Kat again, it hurt very very very much...

&quot;AUGHH!! WHAT THE FU-&quot;

&quot;well you DID tell me I couldn&#39;t smoke on school grounds&quot; Oren cut off 
the cursing girl with a slight smirk on her face. The teacher just 
sighed, deciding not to argue today. Everyone in the class stared in 
A)	Horror
B)	What the fuck??
C)	HAHA THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST THING EVER!! 

&quot;Well then, Oren, start getting to work by removing the posters back 
there&quot; The teacher pointed, Oren walked, and the teacher began to 
lecture again. Natalie tried not to pay any sort of attention at all, 
but heard something get put on her desk.

&quot;I believe you dropped this&quot; 

Natalie looked down and saw her 8 paged report due next period and 
gasped. /HELL! If I didn&#39;t get this a chunk of my grade would be lopped 
off...how did I forget it, who-/ Natalie looked up and saw Oren walking 
away...

She stared at the back of her black pea coat for a second, before 
staring back at the title page of her report, finally dawning on her 
what had happened.

&quot;Thanks....Oren&quot; Natalie whispered vacantly at the title page, as guilt 
began to inflate in her stomach silently, and painfully.


&quot;so that REALLY was the Creepy Biker guy?&quot; Natalie&#39;s right arm in crime 
laughed.

&quot;I know Ronnie, I know&quot; Natalie rolled her eyes. As Ronnie began to 
laugh again remembering Natalie falling over her chair.

&quot;sorry, but....your...whole desk, FLIPPED OVER!! HAHAHA&quot; Ronnie laughed even 
harder, grasping onto Natalie&#39;s arm for support. Natalie feigned being 
angry but couldn&#39;t help but smile, Ronnie seemed to be her only real 
friend out of all the popular ones she had...that was saying something. 
After her friend finally recovered from her laughing fit, she grasped 
her arm and pulled &quot;C&#39;mon we got history next&quot;
Natalie only nodded, a slight pink on her cheeks from her friends grin.  
BUMP!

&quot;Ow!&quot; Natalie did a 180* degree turn, heading eye to eye with a evil 
grinning Kat.

&quot;so when your desk flips over you like to show off your panties? 
Princess Slut is also Queen of Klutz&#39;s&quot; She slurred, earning several 
hoots from the people around. Natalie&#39;s fire immediately burned aflame 
in a short second and exploded.

&quot;Well its better then the so called * toughest girl * getting owned by a 
TEACHERS AID!&quot;

That caught Kats attention, her head whirled around, glaring brown eyes 
staring back.

&quot;what did you say?&quot;

&quot;oh, by Mrs. NORDSTEINS T.A of all LESS! I think everyone over rates 
your title by FAR!&quot; Natalie faked laughed. Kat stood at 5&#39;7 inches., had 
an athletic build and was supposedly the toughest girl at school, head 
of the chain gang that was gaining a fierce reputation. Deep inside 
Natalie&#39;s head, she knew she had to push the wrong persons buttons...and 
with that look Kat was giving her, it wasn&#39;t going to be pretty.

&quot;Who the hell do you think you&#39;re talking to bitch?&quot; Kat hissed, inside 
of Natalie&#39;s mind, she just shrugged.

&quot;TO a girl who&#39;s face is an ashtray, an ugly one no less&quot; Natalie 
growled. Kat&#39;s arm shoved into Natalie&#39;s collar. Natalie saw the fist, 
prepared herself and shut her eyes tightly

&quot;NOW YOU&#39;RE GONNA G-&quot;

A quick shove and a growl, then Natalie felt as if she was grabbed.

&quot;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; A voice sharply asked. 

&quot;fuck...stay out of this&quot; A malicious Kat seethed. Natalie popped her eyes 
opened, only to realize that she was staring into black threads. / what 
the? My life just flashed before me.../ Natalie looked up and was staring 
at the cheek, ear, and a bunch of thick, white hair.

&quot;Oren?&quot;

&quot;Toughest girl? I don&#39;t think so&quot; Oren said, her eyes never twitching or 
showing any sort of emotion. Kat&#39;s left eye twitched as she yelled, 
&quot;I&#39;ll KICK YOUR ASS ALL THE WAY INTO NEXT WEEK, NOW GET YOUR ASS OUT OF 
HERE!&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll kill you next Thursday&quot;  Like a tiger&#39;s growl, as soon as 
those words left Oren&#39;s mouth EVERYTHING went still...and cold. Natalie 
didn&#39;t hear much though, usually if a complete creepy stranger was 
holding her tightly against their bodies with one hand, Natalie would 
struggle and try to get out...but this was different.

/strong, safe, warm/ that mantra kept repeating itself in Natalie&#39;s 
head.

/comfortable/ was the next word added a few seconds later. 

&quot;get to class now, wouldn&#39;t want you late would I?&quot; Oren&#39;s voice cut her 
thoughts. Natalie looked over and couldn&#39;t believe what she was seeing, 
Kat was TWITCHING the so called * toughest girl* was twitching under the 
gaze of Oren!

&quot;I&#39;ll....I&#39;ll get you later&quot; she spat hastily and turned her heel to run 
off. Natalie felt herself getting pushed out of the newfound comfort 
zone. &quot;Get to class&quot;

&quot;whoa, WOAH!&quot; Natalie&#39;s shocked mind hadn&#39;t been able to inform her 
brain (until too late) hat she was tipping over on her own shoelace. 
/TTIIIMMMmmmbbbeerrrr/ Her mind hoarsely yelled, shutting her eyes close 
ready for the strong impact of the hard floor, but only to land again in 
the /strong, warm, safe, comfortable/ zone. Before she could how ever 
enjoy it, she was tipped back onto her two feet and Oren was looking 
intently into her eyes. Natalie&#39;s face flushed a deep red as she felt 
the heat greatly sizzle her cheeks.

&quot;You&#39;re a klutz&quot; Oren murmured walking away quickly. /I have a name you 
know/ Natalie&#39;s mind burned, but was snapped short by Ronnie grabbing 
her arm and running, dragging her along back to History class. 

&quot;HA! Did you see that? Kat was totally pissing her pants at Oren&#39;s gaze! 
Wonderful isn&#39;t it? Ronnie giggled. Natalie nodded, her face still 
flushed, wondering what the heck went on back there.
