<h1>Necroknight (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/elkat.html">Elkat</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/necroknight-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a>  <p align="center"><font size="4" face="Century"><b>Chapter 4: New Alliances</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The cloaked figures enclosed 
on the tigress and hunter with surprising speed. As the tigress pounced 
one of the cloaked figures, biting its neck with crushing strength. 
Meanwhile Shiko rolled off the bed, snatching her quiver that lay at 
a hands reach. Drawing an arrow, she tossed with all her strength, piercing 
another of the cloaked figures in the throat. <i>(Two arrows left and 
with only my normal arm strength to propel the arrow, I must aim to 
kill,) </i>she thought as she pulled the second arrow.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Blood was spilled as the cloaked 
figure the tigress had attacked chopped into her side with its kama 
despite having suffered a fatal wound. The figure that had been pierced 
by Shiko&#39;s first arrow didn&#39;t slow one bit nor attempt to remove the 
arrow in its neck. &quot;Foolish girls! You cannot kill my death-dolls!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;D-Death dolls?&quot; girls 
asked, gulping. Something that couldn&#39;t be killed... She of only one 
type of creature that couldn&#39;t be killed; the living <b>dead</b>. The 
color drained from her face and her hands began to shake. Her breathing 
became shallow and her chest constricted. The only thought that would 
register in her mind was &quot;run&quot;. Grabbing the mattress, she 
hefted it at the cloaked figures and knocked them over like bowling 
pins. Tossing her arrow, she forced Neco Lee to duck out of the arrow&#39;s 
path. Grabbing the bed sheets and draping it around her shouted &quot;Tora-sama 
run!&quot; while running out of the room and slipping past a flat-footed 
Neco Lee. The tigress, dislodging the kama and shoving herself off the 
cloaked figure she had pounced, followed the hunter.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Laughing hysterically, the necrophiliac 
watched the women depart. &quot;So they ran, eh? Well I&#39;m up to the 
game! Girls hunt them down and bring back their bodies! I don&#39;t care 
how many limbs you have to cut off, just make sure that you keep the 
damage to a minimum!&quot; The woman barked to the cloaked figures who 
were getting back onto their feet. Nodding, they shuffled out and chased 
after the girls.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; 
Long asked as one of the twins appeared before him, kneeling on knee. 
He still sat in the same chair in the same position, almost practically 
with the same posture as if he hadn&#39;t moved an inch.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;The knight&#39;s going to 
attack mistress Lee!&quot; the girl exclaimed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Is that it?&quot; Long 
said in a dull tone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;But master, mistress Lee 
is an important client of ours! We loose her, our profits will drop!&quot; 
the girl said, confused by how he acted.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;And if the knight brings 
her promised order, we won&#39;t need her patronage,&quot; Long said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Not to mention it&#39;s only 
a matter of time before she learns that you killed the real Neco Long 
right before taking this town from us,&quot; said a new voice from atop 
the stairs. &quot;Or have you forgotten your real identity, Lili-imouto?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Of course not Hou-nee!&quot; 
Long said, removing his dou li. Long black hair and a feminine face 
greeted the new comer. &quot;How long has it been since you sold me 
to that greedy pig?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;A little over three decades. 
I only remember that because as soon as I did you helped Gutou Daiyu 
with that little rebellion and stole my city right under me!&quot; snarled 
Hu Hou as she climbed down the stairs. &quot;And thanks to that horny 
little freak, you&#39;ve taken the lives of my people for the last time!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Big words! How about I 
collar you and teach you how it&#39;s like to be a slave!&quot; Lili said, 
tossing her dou li at the new comer.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The conical hat was split in 
half as Hu Hou brandished a jian. &quot;Is that why you continue to 
enslave girls, to teach them what it&#39;s like to suffer? I didn&#39;t know 
you were so sadistic!&quot; The woman said rushing forward.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;You wouldn&#39;t understand! 
You never had to live in another&#39;s shadows for most of their life!&quot; 

Lili returned as she leaped from the chair with a flying kick.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Hu Hou side stepped the attack 
and thrust her jian forward to impale her opponent.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Turning in mid-air, Lili rolled 
away from the blade while landing on all fours. Sweeping out with a 
foot, she knocked her elder sister&#39;s feet from under her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  With lighting fast reflexes, 
Hu Hou slapped her hands on the ground, bracing herself as she black 
flipped away a safe distance. &quot;You&#39;ve gotten rusty, Lili-imouto!&quot; 
Hu Hou said with a sinister grin.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;It is you who gotten rusty 
Hou-nee because I only fight on the level of my opponent; the weaker 
they are, the more I hold back. I&#39;d exert more strength fighting a newly 
born babe!&quot; Lili returned with a chuckle.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;I&#39;ll enjoy cutting that 
smart little tongue of yours!&quot; Hu Hou hissed, charging forward.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;And I&#39;ll enjoy watching 
moan and cry in pleasure as you are forced into the suffering as you 
subject the slaves you buy from me to!&quot; Lili said, shifting into 
a defensive posture.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Eh master... have you 
forgotten about the knight and mistress Lee?&quot; the girl who had 
been kneeling on knee for the entire time said, sighing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Go and make sure that 
the knight stays alive damn it! If she dies, I submit you and your sister 
to unimaginable torture!&quot; Lili snarled as she ducked under the 
swing of Hu Hou&#39;s jian.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;R-Right!&quot; the girl 
said, getting up and running up the stairs and into the street.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Bones couldn&#39;t shake the feeling 
of discomfort she had been feeling since she left the Black Dragon Inn. 
She could have easily turned back now, but she knew she couldn&#39;t allow 
the hellfire skeleton to harm more. She had to continue onward. She&#39;ll 
let no one stop her!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The nine identical women that 
the twins had summoned rushed forward, surrounding the knight and stopping.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Bones skittered to a stop, looking 
at the women angrily. &quot;Did he send you here to stop me? Doesn&#39;t 
he understand that innocents are being killed? Please! I must stop that 
monstrosity!&quot; the knight exclaimed, looking at each of them in 
turn.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The women didn&#39;t budge.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Have it that way!&quot; 
the knight said somberly. Bringing her hands together, she knight began 
to chant, &quot;(Warriors in white, skeletal soldiers, aid in this fight)!&quot; 

A pentagram formed under her feet, glowing with a black energy. The 
energy flashed bright and faded soon after. Burned into the ground was 
the pentagram and standing at each of its point stood a skeletal warrior 
clad in armor made of magically reinforced bone. &quot;Attack the enemies 
before me!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The skeletal warriors slowly 
moved forward, weapons readied to strike.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  With a flick of the wrist, the 
warriors wrapped the skeletal warriors in nearly invisible nylon wires. 
With the slightest tug, the wires cut through the warriors with ease.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The empty eye sockets of the 
skeletal warrior&#39;s began to flash brightly and their began jaws chattering. 
Without warning their skulls exploded, expelling a thick cloud of smoke 
as they sent fragments of bone everywhere. As the smoke cleared, the 
identical women were revealed to have been unharmed by the explosion 
and that they no longer surround Bones.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The women charged into the nearest 
alley, weaving through the back streets in attempt to cut off the knight 
who successful escaped them for the moment.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The younger of the identical 
twins found herself in the red light district- or what remained of it, 
where she faced a charred skeleton walking about, laughing maniacally. 

&quot;I could swear I felt one of their chi coming from around here, 
but I don&#39;t see mistress Lee anywhere!&quot; The younger sister said, 
looking around. &quot;Skeleton-san! Have you seen a group of suspicious 
looking cloaked figures?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;You mean the fools that 
have been running about screaming &#39;protect Ho Hou-sama&#39;?&quot; the skeleton 
said looking towards her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Eh, no... those are just 
a bunch of good for nothing informants of the Tiger clan. I&#39;m looking 
for some people, I think most were female, but one was male.... or was 
he? Well the important one, mistress Lee came to master&#39;s shop wanting 
to receive her present and-&quot; the girl began, but the skeleton cut 
her off.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Oh it&#39;s you. You may not 
recognize me, but I&#39;m that guy with them. So what do you want?&quot; 
the skeleton said, sighing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Well there&#39;s a knight 
that saw the fire and she ran this way, wanting to stop mistress Lee 
and-&quot; the girl began to explain, but the skeleton cut her off again.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;A knight! Tell, was she 
one of these dreary elves with long black hair and a little dog?&quot; 
the skeleton asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Yeah, I think...&quot; 
the girl said, thinking.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;I knew she&#39;d come! Where 
is she?&quot; the skeleton asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Well she came from the 
inn, so she&#39;d be coming from this direction,&quot; the girl said, pointing 
in the direction of the Black Dragon Inn.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The skeleton madly and ran off 
in the same direction.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Wait! I&#39;m suppose to keep 
you away from her!&quot; the girl cried, but it was too late; he was 
long gone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>&quot;(Imoto, have you found 
mistress Lee?)&quot; </i>spoke a voice in the girl&#39;s head.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>&quot;(No, onee-chan! I met 
with one of her companions and I accidentally pointed him in the direction 
of the knight! I&#39;m so sorry!)&quot; </i>

she replied telepathically.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>&quot;(It&#39;s okay, though 
we&#39;ve been new orders. Master has forsaken mistress Lee, but we have 
now to protect the knight! If we don&#39;t, our punishment will be 
unimaginable!!)&quot;</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century"><i>  &quot;(No!!!)&quot; </i>
the girl moaned telepathically.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>&quot;(Stop that companion! 
I&#39;ll protect the knight!)&quot;</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century"><i>  &quot;(Understood!)&quot; </i>
the girl thought, nodding her head.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The older twin ran as quickly 
as possible through the back streets of Dusklan&#39; to catch up with the 
knight. The fastest route to the red light district, where the knight 
was heading, went past the Black Dragon Inn where the knight&#39;s squire 
and particularly familiar tigress was escaping from. Chasing them not 
very far behind was Neco Lee&#39;s cloaked companions. <i>(Though master 
said to protect the knight, if I let anything happen to her companions, 
the knight might not bring the order that master desires more than anything 
and we&#39;d be held responsible... I&#39;ll help them and then find the knight!) </i>

The girl thought. <i>&quot;(Imouto, I&#39;m going to help out the knight&#39;s 
companions. I&#39;ll leave the knight in your hands.)&quot; </i>
She said telepathically.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>&quot;(Ok, Neechan!)&quot; </i>
The younger sister&#39;s voice said in her head.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Exiting through an alley, the 
girl shot towards the hunter and the tigress, taking them by surprise. 

&quot;Follow me!&quot; she called out them as she disappeared down another 
alley. The hunter and tigress, though confused, followed her. Together 
the three of them began to weave through the maze like backstreets of 
the city.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Excuse me, but where are 
you taking us?&quot; Shiko asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;To the knight! I&#39;ve been 
given orders to protect her,&quot; the girl said, turning at a corner.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;I&#39;m grateful for you helping 
us, but I cannot fight like this!&quot; the hunter said, holding the 
sheet around her the best she could.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Don&#39;t worry! There&#39;s a 
clothier and armory not far from here, but we&#39;ll need to loose these 
guys first,&quot; the girl said, abruptly turning at a passage that 
was hard to see in the darkness of the night.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The hunter and tigress followed 
after her, effectively disappearing from sight in time for the cloaked 
figures to run past the hidden passage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;That won&#39;t hold them off 
for long,&quot; the girl said, &quot;But until they realize what&#39;s happened, 
we have time to prepare ourselves. She pulled open a door in one of 
the alley&#39;s walls and stepped inside. The hunter and tigress followed 
her. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century"> Closing the door behind them, the 
girl flipped a switch and a slowly a light filled the room. Racks of 
clothes surrounded the trio. &quot;Let&#39;s begin by getting dressed. That 
includes you.&quot; She said, pointing to the tigress.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;So I&#39;m to be freed?&quot; 
the tigress asked, transforming into her humanoid form.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;That&#39;s to be decided by 
my master. For now, we&#39;ll need all the fighting strength we can get,&quot; 

the girl said, pulling out a number of clothing articles from the racks.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Both Shiko and the tiger-woman 
dressed in black qipao and trousers, and shoes, though Shiko the sleeves 
of her qipao in place with vanbraces to allow her to fire arrows without 
her hand-eye coordination being restricted. Once they were dressed, 
the girl brought them to the armory that was the adjoining building. 
Shiko grabbed the best bow she could find and a quiver of silver tipped 
arrows. The tiger-woman sorted through the spears and polearms, finally 
settling with a simple spear she found.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Now, let&#39;s save the knight!&quot; 
the girl said. She led the girls to the door, but stopped before exiting. 
Gesturing for them to remain silent, they opened the door a crack and 
peeked outside. As she had expected one of the cloaked figures had discovered 
the hidden passage and were now searching the alleyway intently. The 
girl backed away and gestured the hunter towards her. &quot;(Can you 
soulpierce?)&quot; she asked, whispering into the girl&#39;s ear.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Not really. I&#39;ve only 
done it once and I was really upset at the time,&quot; the hunter said 
in return.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Then I&#39;ll teach you a 
little. First knock your bow,&quot; the girl instructed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Right,&quot; the hunter 
said, drawing an arrow and knocking it on her bow.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Now close your eyes and 
empty your mind of the entire world,&quot; the girl continued.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Shiko closed her eyes and tried 
her best to clear her mind.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;You need to make your 
mind a blank slate necessarily, but rather invert your thoughts. Think 
not about anybody or anything else; just you.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>(Think only about myself...) </i>
the hunter thought. Her body began to slowly glow with silver light.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;That&#39;s it, now think about 
the arrow in your hand.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The hunter visualized the arrow 
in her mind and the light drifted from her body to the arrow.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Now visualize the enemy.&quot; 

the girl said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The image of the cloaked figures 
came into her mind, though they appeared only as masses of purple energy. 
&quot;These lights...&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;What you see are the soulthreads 
that give them life. In your mind focus on piercing this thread and 
fire!&quot; the girl said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Right!&quot; the hunter 
moved her bow and aimed for one of the lights. Releasing her arrow, 
it shot forward, striking the cloaked figure she was aiming at dead 
on. The arrow flashed brightly on the hit and caused the cloaked figure&#39;s 
body to burst in purple light. The cloaked figure fell to the ground 
lifelessly. The rest gathered about the body and looked in the direction 
the arrow came from.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Good job, now get back!&quot; 

the girl said, yanking the hunter back and shutting the door.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Opening her eyes, the hunter 
looked confused. &quot;But Bones-sensei said it was difficult to do 
without Soulpiercing silver.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;If you haven&#39;t guessed 
by the uniforms you are wearing, this place is our storehouses, so those 
arrows are a part of arms collection and it only make since that they 
would be purified into soulpiercing silver!&quot; the girl said in a 
matter of fact way. &quot;However we can&#39;t dawdle over small facts like 
that, we must now move. We have to get moving. They&#39;ll catch on to our 
location quickly enough!&quot; She led them to another door. Opening 
the door, she motioned for them to follow her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Wait! What was the point 
of teaching me to Soulpierce?&quot; the hunter asked. &quot;If you wanted 
to distract them, couldn&#39;t I have just shot a normal arrow?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;You mean that was all 
to distract them?&quot; the tiger-woman said, confused.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Call it an act of generosity!&quot; 
the girl said with a smile. &quot;No let&#39;s get going!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The trio left the room and the 
girl closed it behind her.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Running down the back streets, 
they soon saw night sky brighten by unholy blue flames.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Those flames!&quot; the 
hunter said, surprised.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;They must be close by!&quot; 
the commented.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;We better hurry!&quot; 
the tiger-woman said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Turning a corner, they were 
greeted by a group of women.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Those are the slaves from 
the White Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe!&quot; Shiko said in surprise.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Wait!&quot; the tiger-woman 
said, stopping the girl and the hunter with her outstretched spear. 
&quot;They smell odd.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Odd?&quot; the girl asked, 
sniffing the air. &quot;Though it&#39;s masked by perfume, they&#39;re drenched 
in embalming fluids. They&#39;re no longer among the living!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Shiko&#39;s widened in shock and 
horror as the color drained from her face. Her body began to shook as 
tears built on their eyes. &quot;D-did she do this to them?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it past 
mistress Lee,&quot; the girl said darkly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Leave them to me,&quot; 
the tiger woman said. &quot;Go to your knight!&quot; Without allowing 
the hunter to argue, she ran forward, spear readied set to impale.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Let&#39;s go!&quot; the girl 
said, grabbing the hunter by the wrist and dragging her back. Pulling 
the girl into another hidden passage, she lead them to the street, stopping 
at the end of the alley. They could see the hellborn skeleton, Bones 
and the younger twin all together. &quot;Your welcome.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;For what?&quot; the hunter 
asked as she wiped the tears from her face.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;For teaching you how to 
Soulpierce,&quot; the girl said, smiling.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The girl looked at the trio 
who were quite a way&#39;s from them and then the girl. Her lips curled 
into a warm smile as she bowed respectfully to the girl. 
&quot;&quot;Arigato!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Now stop wasting time 
and shoot!&quot; the girl barked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;R-right!&quot; Shiko said, 
grabbing an arrow and knocking it. She closed her eyes and cleared her 
mind of anything except herself. Once she began to glow with the silver 
light, she focused on the arrow, sending the light to the arrow and 
finally on hellborn skeleton which appeared to her as a strong blue 
mass of energy. Once she had aligned her arrow, she fired it.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The nine identical women had 
cutoff Bones again, having once more out maneuver here with the help 
of the city&#39;s back alley&#39;s. &quot;I&#39;ll have to-&quot; the knight began, 
placing her hands together, but nearly invisible, razor sharp wires 
wrapped about her body. &quot;I guess the same trick won&#39;t work 
twice...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Suddenly the women combusted 
in bright blue, unholy flames. The fell to the ground, writhing in pain 
as the flames consumed their bodies and reduced them to charred skeletons. 
The wires binding Bones&#39; body loosened and fell to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for 
you!&quot; the charred skeleton said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;How many Hellborn skeletons 
does <i>he </i>control?&quot; Bones asked looking at the skeleton in 
disgust.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;It&#39;s hard to say, I&#39;ve 
personally lost count after the 90th,&quot; the skeleton said, shrugging.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>(T-that many? A single one 
is powerful enough to kill a skilled warrior barehanded, but over ninety? 
At this rate, he could possibly take over the continent- no the world 
as we know it! But why hasn&#39;t he?) </i>
The knight thought, sweat drops beading on her hot skin as a cold shiver 
ran down her spine.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Stop right there! You 
are no longer an ally of my master! Lay a hand on that knight and I&#39;ll 
be forced to destroy you!&quot; the older twin said, running up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;<i>My </i>
master will be disappointed to hear that. He was planning to scout him, 
but it looks like we&#39;ll have to lay waste to this entire city!&quot; 
the skeleton said, laughing maniacally.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;I won&#39;t you hurt anyone 
else!&quot; the knight hissed, reaching for her Nodachi only to grab 
empty air. Her face paled as she remembered that she left the blade 
with Long in order to have it repaired. <i>(L-Like it would make much 
of a difference... Nothing can stand those hellish flames- except something 
that already has been bathed in the flames!) </i>
Removing her gauntlet, she grabbed the wire with her exposed hand, cutting 
herself. The blood flowed quickly and the knight closed her hand, sprinkling 
the blood onto the skulls of the women that had been sent to stop her. 
&quot;(Blood from the knife, bondage of soul, bring the dead to life!)&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The blood began bubbling and 
turned black. The black, bubbling blood then seeped into the skulls&#39; 
every pore. The skulls began to glow with black energy, twin pricks 
of red light appearing in their empty eye sockets. The black energy 
soon stretched to the rest of their bodies. The black energy faded and 
the skeletons stood up.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;I thought it was forbidden 
to create Hellborn Skeleton!&quot; the skeleton said, cackling.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;It is forbidden to create 
a Hellborn Skeleton through the effect of Hellfire spell, but animating 
skeletons that have been bathed in hellfire is not in any way against 
the law!&quot; the knight said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Technically a Hellborn 
Skeleton is an acquired template that can be applied to any creature 
with a skeletal system killed by the <i>Hellfire Reincarnation</i> spell!&quot; 

the girl said, pulling out a tall, hard cover book and opening it. &quot;A 
skeleton charred by a hellfire spell and animated by a <i>Corpse Animation</i> 
spell is simply a skeleton with the Hellfire subtype including the immunity 
to Hellfire and the vulnerability to-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;DON&#39;T GIVE AWAY OUR SECRETS!&quot; 
the skeleton cried, snatching the book from the girl. &quot;Fiery lush, 
charcoaled flesh, burn everything I touch!&quot; The skeleton was coated 
in bright blue flames the reduced the book it held to ashes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;That was a first edition <i>

Graveyards &amp; Ghouls</i> Boogie Bestiary! You know how hard it was 
to obtain that?&quot; the cried.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Stand back! Only those 
born of hellfire can withstand the flames of the Hellfire Armor spell!&quot; 
the knight said, putting her gauntlet back on. &quot;My skeletal soldiers 
attack!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The nine skeletal warriors slowly 
made their way to the hellborn skeleton.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;You think those proxies 
can stop me!&quot; the charred skeleton said, laughing harshly. As the 
skeletons approached, swiping an arm that caused them to shatter on 
contact. &quot;These skeletons are too frail to compare to I, an elite!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Of course not!&quot; Bones 
yelled rushing forward with an open hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Cackling the skeleton grabbed 
the knight by her arm. &quot;I won&#39;t fall for the same tricks that felled 
the my predecessor!&quot; Blue flames engulfed the arm. Reaching out 
with his other hand, the skeleton reached for Bones&#39; face.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Suddenly an arrow struck the 
skeleton&#39;s arm, exploding in blinding light. As the light faded, the 
skeleton&#39;s arm was nowhere to be seen. &quot;What the-?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;So you won&#39;t fall for 
the same old tricks?&quot; the knight said with a smirk, grabbing the 
skeleton&#39;s skull with her free hand and shooting a wave of black energy 
into it. Though her other arm caught fire as well, the skull exploded 
and the skeleton&#39;s body fell to the ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">   The blue flames that engulfed 
the skeleton&#39;s body slowly died out. The flames on the knight&#39;s arms 
however, were still alit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Grabbing each arm in her hands, 
she quickly slipped her hands and arms out of what remained of her gauntlets 
and the sleeves of her chain mail shirt. Like the last battle she had 
been, her arms were relatively unharmed except for some light burns. 
&quot;I hope I don&#39;t have to do this every time I fight one them... 
I don&#39;t think the council will continue footing the bill for replacement 
chain mail and gauntlets.&quot; <i>(He knew that the skeletons were 
just a feint. Did he must have studied the last battle and calculated 
I&#39;d use the same tactic. With over ninety of these hellborn skeletons, 
I cannot make the same mistake when battling the third one!)</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>&quot;(Imouto-chan are you 
okay?)&quot; </i>The older twin asked telepathically.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>&quot;(I&#39;m fine, though I 
lost your first edition </i>Graveyards &amp; Ghouls <i>Boogie Bestiary! 
I&#39;m so sorry!)&quot; </i>The younger twin replied.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  <i>&quot;(It&#39;s okay! Now let&#39;s 
regroup,)&quot; </i>the older twin replied, stepping out of the alley 
with Shiko.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The avoided looking at the skeleton&#39;s 
arms as she walked out of the alley. She looked at her master, who looked 
upon her with a proud smile, causing her to look blush and look away 
to hide her face. She happened to looked down, but not far enough that 
would see the skeleton. Instead she looked down far enough to see the 
knight&#39;s burned arms. All color drained from her face as she ran to 
the knights side.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  The knight wanted to raise her 
arms to embrace her squire, but the slightest movement caused them to 
send pain through her entire body. &quot;I&#39;m in your de-&quot; the knight 
began, but the palm of Shiko&#39;s hand silenced as it connected with her 
cheek in a loud slap.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Y-you idiot! What were 
you thinking! If I hadn&#39;t been there to save you, you would have...&quot; 
the hunter yelled, tears welling in her eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t live without 
you!&quot; the girl said, burrowing her head into the knight&#39;s bosoms 
as she embraced her master lovingly, sobbing hysterically.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;You must have a low Wisdom 
score knight-san,&quot; the younger twin said looking at the knight.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Indeed, doing something 
so reckless, but for that girl to forgive you so easily, she must truly 
be in love with you,&quot; the elder twin added. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about 
Neco Lee. We&#39;ll find and deal with her. You two fought enough tonight.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Arigato,&quot; the knight 
said.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Hu Hou pulled herself along 
the wall of the stair case, rushing out of the Dragon&#39;s Den as quickly 
as her exhausted body would allow her to. <i>(Damn it! I won&#39;t let that 
little bitch get away with this!) </i>
She thought. A look over her shoulder confirmed that Lili stood there 
smugly, waiting for the woman to fall. &quot;I-I won&#39;t let you have 
any satisfaction, you greedy bitch!&quot; She hissed. &quot;How long 
do you think you can go on fooling Neco Lee? When she finds out-&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Worry not my fair beauty, 
I already have,&quot; said a voice from beside her.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Her face paled as she looked 
at the woman that leaned the walls of the Dragon&#39;s Den with her arms 
crossed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;And I&#39;ve heard that you 
have something that belongs to me!&quot; the woman said, smiling.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Please, I&#39;ll give you 
anything, j-just don&#39;t kill me!&quot; Hu Hou said, shaking in fear.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Well, I&#39;d really want 
the tiger, but I have a feeling that the cute little knight is not going 
to let me have it. I also wanted to recruit Neco Long, but he&#39;s dead 
and I heard this crazy rumor about the person masquerading as him wanting 
to sell out to the knights. What will I do?&quot; the woman said, sighing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Take me instead!&quot; 
Hu Hou said in a rather demanding way.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Even though it was at 
my ally&#39;s hands that your precious minions were slain?&quot; the necrophiliac 
asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;I have safely hidden those 
that were important to me and I can replace that which I lost. I may 
not look like it, but I have many years on the battlefield experience 
and can lead any number of soldiers. I-&quot; the woman began, standing 
as tall as her exhausted and bruised body would allow her too.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;That&#39;s good enough. I 
just don&#39;t want to return empty handed especially since I fear I&#39;ve 
lost a few of my own girls. I don&#39;t suppose that is too much of a lost 
to you, is it Lili?&quot; she woman said glancing down the stairs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;It&#39;ll give a me a reason 
to aid the knights further,&quot; Lili said, smirking.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Then let&#39;s be off. I can&#39;t 
afford to loose any time!&quot; Neco Lee said, walking off. Hu Hou followed 
as quickly as possible.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  By the time that the twins would 
reach the Dragon&#39;s Den, the pair would be long gone.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  In a few days, the burns on 
Bones&#39; arms had healed and Lili, having taken up the guise as Neco Long 
again, had replaced her Nodachi&#39;s blade. &quot;Now be careful, I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;ll be able to replace the blade again,&quot; Lili said, handing 
the sword to the knight.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Arigato,&quot; Bones said, 
taking the sword.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;About the tiger...&quot; 
Shiko began, but her voice trailed off.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Take her. Consider it 
as a consolation gift for all the trouble my sister caused you,&quot; 
Lili said, removing the collar around the tigress that sat at her feet.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  Free of the collar, the tigress 
strolled over to Shiko, rubbing against her lovingly, much to the dismay 
of Marrow who cowered behind Bones.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;It seems that Hu Hou, 
the leader of the Tiger Clan has sworn alliance to Neco Lee. She&#39;s not 
to underestimate. If not for the benefit of surprise, we&#39;d would surely 
have lost in the battle to take this city three decades ago,&quot; Lili 
said. &quot;She&#39;ll try to retake this city; there&#39;s no doubt.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Then we have common enemy,&quot; 
Bones said, nodding.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Long live the Skullguard,&quot; 
Lili said, offering her hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Century">  &quot;Long live the Dragon Clan,&quot; 
Bones said, taking Lili&#39;s hand and shaking it.</font> <br> <br>
