Chronicle Ten - a living corpse in the ice 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

South Shidou, was definitely one of the hardest places to live. 

A country that was completely covered over with ice and snow. The frozen 
waters and icy tundra that made up the mountain ranges and slates of 
frost had never been a place at which man could settle. Some modern 
scientists believed that this was the same for the world long before its 
&#39;reshaping&#39;. There were people left who knew... just no one left who 
cared. But South Shidou was not entirely insignificant. With an overall 
land mass of nearly 2,000,000 miles that was made almost entirely of ice 
and water, it was a place of pure peace. Free from the world around it, 
South Shidou existed as the perfect place for experimentation, as long 
as those involved were willing to take the challenge of living on the 
coldest place on Earth. 

Perhaps this was the reason for the Ashurian Empire to construct such a 
small but grossly important research facility there. And perhaps that 
was why one of the most important archaeological digs ever was being 
conducted from that same facility. That building was known as the South 
Shidou Investigative Research Station (or SSIRS for short). It was a 
compact laboratory complex forged into the upper lip of the coastal 
lines of South Shidou. Automatically placing it as cautionary close to 
the mainland as possible. And this was to be the place where Operation 
Y-S would be accomplished. Just a mile south of the SSIRS, two short but 
hulking bipedal construction worker machines (their official names were 
Edifice Slaves; but they were more commonly known as &#39;Chuggers&#39;) marched 
a slow dirge downwards. Their flat metal feet stepped across the ice on 
a walk to a certain site on the country. And following shortly behind 
them was a land jeep, designed with tyres that could compensate for the 
lack of traction on the ice. Eventually the two Chuggers and the jeep 
found their destination. A very large hillock, standing at a height of 
over 56 metres, that was seemingly built up purely of ice. The Chuggers 
and the jeep stopped when the came to the hill. What was left of the 
last archaeological team to assess this place (all the schematics, 
diagrams, tables, chairs and tents) still surrounded the front half of 
the ice mound. Not much progress had been made up till now. That was the 
most logical reason for sending in the Chuggers to carry out the second 
portion of Operation Y-S. The two worker machines stomped up to the ice 
dome with their loud footsteps and then stopped a second time. The 
pilots manning the two Chuggers then extended the arms of their bipedal 
devices to their target. The twin hand-like proportions of the Chuggers 
opened. From their &#39;palms&#39; came very highly concentrated beams of 
energy. The four red beams cut into certain specific sections of the 
hillock. Melting the ice in part with precise actions that carved a way 
inward for the hands of the Chuggers. They kept this up for quite a 
while, at least an hour, until finally they cut far enough into the ice 
to see another substance. A black substance that was definitely more 
than mere ice. 

Suddenly the man in the jeep yelled out &#39;that&#39;s enough&#39;.

The two pilots of the Chuggers heard that and turned off the energy 
beams of their machines The man in the jeep, an Asiatic man whose body 
was enswathed with heat-preserving overalls, leapt out and touched upon 
the ice with his own shoes. He then walked up to the incision made by 
the tall hillock they were dealing with. About half a metre into the ice 
was the hardened &#39;shell&#39; of that which encased their target. The Asiatic 
man with the eternal frown on his face reached into that hole and then 
repeatedly knocked his knuckles into the section of that shell. 

&quot;Unmistakable,&quot; He said, &quot;that is definitely hardened Qi energy. 
Amazing. For well over 6000 years the Qi from the Divine Hibernation is 
still in tact. I&#39;d wager that the extreme cold froze the Qi soon after 
it began... probably explaining the shape of the mound.&quot;

One of the pilots opened the flat hatch to his Chugger and looked out at 
what he had freed up from the ice. &quot;Hey, Professor Quan, are you sure 
about this? I mean it just looks like some kinda dark ice to me.&quot;

The Professor, the man named Long Wu Quan, replied to that with a snort 
and stated. &quot;That&#39;s because you are an uneducated worker. Nothing more 
than that. If you knew anything... you would know what this truly is. 
Katarium, in its purest and most solid form. And Katarium itself is a 
form of hardened Qi energy. Very few ruins from the old world still 
possess a Katarium structure such as this. But that is mostly because Qi 
was of such little importance to that culture.  And this is only the 
shell that enfolds what we want Imagine what could be learned from its 
contents...&quot;

Then another voice, one willowy but greased with the attitude of rank, 
called out to Long Wu from behind with a chuckle. &quot;Heh. You scientists 
are always so frickin&#39; romantic about such meaningless trifle.&quot;

Long Wu turned around in that instant. A young woman was suddenly 
standing behind him. Dressed fully in the white and blue military 
uniform of the Schutzenreich, with a small hand pistol attached to her 
waist. She looked no more than twenty years of age; her face framed by a 
long mass of blonde hair that simply inched its way down to the crests 
of her behind. This woman stood cross-armed, smirking, her beautiful 
face saturated by what appeared to be nothing more than a bloodthirsty 
soul. And though he had never met her before, Long Wu knew who this 
woman was, just from hearing her speak. 

The one known as Aratia de Toscana. 

&quot;Miss Toscana,&quot; Long Wu said, &quot;I believe?&quot;

Aratia uncrossed her arms with another smirk and marched up to the 
incision in the ice Standing beside Long Wu she looked at the sphere 
without the glow of wonder in the Professor&#39;s eyes. &quot;So this is it, is 
it? This is the thing I was dragged out of Aryahm for?&quot;

Long Wu removed his hand from the opening. He stared at Aratia for a 
moment, not letting the fact that she had no protective clothing to warm 
her in such a cold environment That alone showed her inner strength to 
him. &quot;...While this might not be the most glamorous of all your 
missions, Miss Toscana... the importance should not be lost to you. And 
might I ask? Just how on earth did you get here?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bother trying to figure it out,&quot; Aratia said, grinning, &quot;I&#39;m a 
member of the Shinjinkai. Or haven&#39;t you heard of me?&quot;

Long Wu frowned. &quot;...Oh, I&#39;ve heard of you, alright.&quot;

&quot;...Do I detect a little hostility? I suppose I shouldn&#39;t normally 
mistake a scientist for a pacifist these days. Or is that in itself the 
problem?&quot;

The Professor looked away, as if to stifle something within himself, and 
turned to look back at the sphere in his charge. &quot;How you conduct 
yourself on the battlefield is of no concern to me. Wars are potentially 
fruitless things resulting only in the loss of life... but if that life 
lost is not my own, then I care not for the consequences. Peace or 
not... I couldn&#39;t care any less about the presence of the Schutzenreich. 
Thus your own actions in your own life mean nothing to me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s so cold,&quot; Aratia prodded with amusement, &quot;do you really expect 
me to believe that?&quot;

&quot;Should I care if you didn&#39;t?&quot; Long Wu replied. 

Aratia smiled at him again. &quot;I suppose not. Anyway. Enough of that I 
just want this thing over and done with so I can get back home. This 
place is the most boring heap of ice in existence.&quot;

Long Wu shook his head. &quot;I have no business telling you how to do your 
job, Miss Toscana. But I think that you should approach this with a 
better degree of caution. This is the most significant discovery we have 
made in the past fifty years. And the importance of what is inside it... 
well... you need only look to your own deployment here to see it for 
what it is.&quot;

Aratia&#39;s smile fell. &quot;...Normally someone of my rank wouldn&#39;t be 
stationed in such a remote dump. So explain to me what it is that&#39;s so 
important about a block of goddamned ice?&quot;

&quot;This is more than just a block of ice,&quot; Long Wu affirmed, &quot;you see this 
inner material within the hillock? That is a type of ancient 
crystallized Qi force that is referred to as Katarium.&quot;

Aratia&#39;s face twisted into a scowl. &quot;I know what Katarium is.&quot;

For one slight moment, the briefest of smiles ran across the face of the 
normally cold hearted Long Wu&#39;s face. Aratia seemed to notice it, but by 
the time it was there, it was gone again. Shortly afterward, Long Wu 
continued. &quot;...I apologize. Anyway. This Katarium formation is over 6000 
years old. That means that it predates the Divine Cataclysm; the 
destruction caused upon the world by the Guardian of Meshezabel, 
Deathcatcher. The very same destruction that annihilated the old 
civilization. The Cradle of the Second Genesis. This sphere was formed 
shortly before that time. And inside this sphere is...&quot;

&quot;...Is what?&quot; Aratia questioned. 

&quot;...Inside this sphere is a Meta Suit and a pilot. Two things that 
were... shall we say... the fruit of magnificence and providence. I had 
believed that the tales spun to me by my superiors in Kyurai were just 
that. Tales. But the condition and formation of this Katarium is living 
proof that that is not the case.&quot;

When Long Wu observed that perplexed expression of Aratia&#39;s, he realized 
that he had gone quite a ways off topic. &quot;...Basically, trapped within 
this sphere of ice and Katarium is an ancient Meta Suit and the one who 
piloted it in the pre-Cataclysm era. This is truly a significant 
discovery&quot;

Aratia looked to the hill of ice. &quot;Hmph. Some outdated hunk of junk and 
a 6000 year old corpse? What the hell is so interesting about that?&quot;

&quot;...Oh?&quot; Long Wu removed his hand from the indentation, &quot;You think of 
this as mere folly? I can&#39;t say that I share that opinion. Because very 
rarely does one see the tainted mirror for what it is. The properties of 
that power are... more than just increased levels of Qi... dark as it 
is...&quot;

Aratia pressed her hand into her hip, beaming another scowl at the 
Asiatic scientist. &quot;What in blazes are you talking about?&quot; 

&quot;...I am saying... that the person who piloted the Meta Suit is probably 
still alive. ...Yes. The suit known as the Oriax... and the woman known 
as... &#39;Yumi Mishima&#39;...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

It was an odd world.

The place known only as The Void. 

There was no footing. No place where one could rest the feet and be 
seated. Below the regulatory axis of horizon there was nothing but the 
visual image of a warm rosy red sky. Like the setting of the sun in the 
Far East of the world. Above that point was the blackness of a grim sky. 
Like a group of rain clouds circling over the vastness of a set of hills 
to the north. Wedged between those two worlds, those representations of 
goodness and darkness, evil and hope, faith and execution, was the 
floating body of Yumi Mishima. Still as she ever was. Her 
shoulder-length hair flocked around her neck. Her sparkling blue eyes 
ever shut. Her limbs loose and free, her body drifting but at the same 
time unmoving. An eternal state for someone who readily smiled upon by 
the fates. No matter how cruel those fates might be.

That was the woman known as Yumi Mishima.

A youthfully masculine voice called to her. &quot;...Yumi... it is time...&quot;

Slowly her eyes began to open again. The eyelids fluttered bit by bit 
until she could see what this was. Where she was. Or where she thought 
she was. Yumi looked straight ahead of her. Floating in the void ahead 
was another person. He was a young man Looking the same age as Yumi did. 
Eighteen and no more. His body was completely naked, just as Yumi&#39;s was. 
But what struck her about him was that long, flowing mane of golden hair 
coming down from his scalp and dancing around his ankles. This boy 
possessed such a gentle smile and expression. But his body spoke of true 
authority, a force that transcended time itself. That Qi force, that 
haughty aura; smouldered potently around the boy&#39;s angelic torso with an 
instantly recognizable clarity. 

Yumi was almost mesmerized by it. &quot;...Who are you...?&quot;

&quot;I have no name,&quot; The golden-haired boy said, &quot;a name exists as more 
than a simple mark of distinction to someone of my kind. A name should 
be a representation of the feelings and emotions that a person undergoes 
when they address that entity.&quot;

Yumi blinked slowly. &quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you do. For example. The name itself might not mean much but when 
one utters the word &#39;God&#39; the sentiments and beliefs that the word 
conjures within ourselves defines the perceptions we have of the one we 
refer to as &#39;God&#39;. Don&#39;t you agree?&quot;

She didn&#39;t know if she did or she didn&#39;t. But that was because she 
didn&#39;t see how it mattered at this point. And so Yumi remained silent. 
No matter what she said, she got the accurate feeling that it would be 
incorrect in someway. 

The entity in the image of a boy smiled once more at her. &quot;My truest 
name shall remain unspoken until the day I am able to see you with 
biological eyes. Very soon I will have the ability to incarnate myself 
upon the world. My time has not yet arrived. But yours has. Soon you 
will leave The Void. Soon you will leave the world which you and I share 
as one. The world in which only you and I can exist And I truly regret 
this. Because if there is a single positive aspect to my imprisonment... 
it is that I was allow to share my prison with you, Yumi. My dearest 
friend.&quot;

Again Yumi was confused. By the way this boy was talking, it seemed as 
if they knew each other for years. But she had no memory of him or of 
this place. None what so ever The golden-haired boy lowered his smile 
when he seemed to sense what Yumi was feeling, and cleared up her 
confusions by stating; &quot;It is okay You do not have memories of... our 
life here. I could never let you suffer like that forever. With the 
powers I have managed to gather up within myself since my 
imprisonment... I have sealed away all memories of your time here. When 
you awake... it will seem as if only a day has passed since... that 
time. And you will have to see the world for what it is with your own 
two eyes. Be brave, my dearest Yumi. Be brave&quot;

Just as Yumi was about to say something to him, something she felt she 
needed to say, the world which he called &#39;The Void&#39; started slipping 
away from her. Yumi opened her mouth to yell to the boy but nothing in 
the way of sound came out from it. All she could do was mouth a certain 
word...

And that word was &#39;Seraphiel&#39;.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Gah!&quot;

Yumi awoke with a start, her upper body leaping up from the pillow of 
the bed she was on. The girl gasped for breath, rasping as if someone 
had been holding her head underwater Yumi pressed her hand onto her 
chest and caught her breath slowly, managing to get herself under 
control again. And once she did, she let her eyes adjust to the location 
she was in. It was a small and quite boxy room. It was padded and 
undecorated In the far corner was a small toilet and sink. And across 
from her own bed was another bed with another girl sitting on it. A girl 
that looked to be around the same age as Yumi was, maybe a little 
younger. The first thing she noticed was how pretty she was. With 
definitively Western looks, she gazed back at Yumi with a shy little 
expression, her pale green hair flowing around her shoulders in slightly 
unkempt strand. This green-haired girl happened to be dressed in a bland 
white smock. The kind of smock you&#39;d expect to see on a patient of a 
hospital. 

The girl pressed her hands into her lap and stared with concern at the 
newly awakened Yumi &quot;...Are you okay? You&#39;ve been sleeping since they 
brought you here?&quot;

Yumi held a hand to her skull, as if to shake off a headache. &quot;...Hold 
on a minute. Let me just get my thoughts... together. First... who are 
you...?&quot;

&quot;Me? I am... Lune. Lune White.&quot;

&quot;...Lune?&quot; Kind of an odd name, Yumi thought, &quot;...fair enough. So now 
where are we? Is this some kind of... Protocol base?&quot;

Lune blinked &quot;...Protocol...?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yumi answered, &quot;have we been captured or something?&quot;

&quot;I... don&#39;t know what you mean...&quot; The girl replied.

Yumi shook her head again. This girl really didn&#39;t seem to understand 
the situation that either of them were in. So the Japanese woman looked 
around the room a little more closely. She was sure that she had no 
memory of coming here. The last thing Yumi remembered was battling 
against Freeman Ronove in Antarctica She had been losing the fight, with 
the Oriax begin damaged severely enough to prevent it from fighting any 
further than that. Then a memory cube stored in the databanks of the 
Oriax came on screen. One that beamed the image of a certain man named 
Geist Fahlem; one who seemed to know of Yumi in the past. He had told 
her to type in a password that would unlock the Oriax&#39;s &#39;true form&#39;, 
which she did. And that was the last thing Yumi remembered. The next 
thing she knew she was in here with Lune. What had happened? How did she 
get here, of all places? What happened to the Oriax? And most 
importantly of all, how did the Chrysalis fare in the fight against Holy 
Protocol? Did they stop the Divine Blade from making it to the 
AM-Cannon? Yumi had so many questions buzzing all around in her mind. 
None of which she had the answers to. And she never would as long as she 
was stuck inside this padded prison cell. 

Yumi looked over at Lune. She was the only hope of Yumi understanding 
what was going on here, no matter how confused she might have been. But 
it was then that Yumi noted the collar that was around Lune&#39;s neck. A 
collar made of a gold-like metal that had a little light which flashed 
every three seconds or so. But it look less a decoration and more a... 
tagging.

&quot;What&#39;s that around your neck?&quot; Yumi said, pointing at it.

Lune blinked when she realized that Yumi was addressing her once more. 
She then tilted her head down and stared at the metal collar around her 
neck as best as she could. &quot;...I&#39;m not really sure what this is. They 
made me wear it years ago. One of them said it was to hold back my 
powers.&quot;

&quot;...I see.&quot; Yumi started to understand a little This collar that Lune 
was wearing was probably some form of Qi control. She remembered that 
when she was captured by Protocol, she had been chained to a wall with 
chains that were forged with an ore that blocked out her powers of Qi. 
This was most likely the same thing. Then Yumi noticed the additional 
weight that she felt around her shoulders. She pressed her fingers 
against it. She had on one of those things too Now she knew for sure 
that she was a prisoner to someone. Most likely Protocol 

Lune lifted a bashful smile at Yumi. &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; She repeated

Yumi shook off her reverie. &quot;Oh. Sorry. My name&#39;s Yumi Mishima.&quot;

Lune kicked her legs off the bedside, childishly. &quot;...It&#39;s nice to meet 
you, Yumi. You&#39;re the first girl I&#39;ve ever met here... apart from 
myself.&quot;

&quot;...How long have you been... inside this place...?&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Lune took a moment to think, &quot;...I guess about... thirteen 
years? That sounds right. I&#39;m about to turn eighteen in a month&#39;s time. 
But I&#39;ve been here since I was five. That&#39;s what the doctors told me.&quot;

Yumi was literally stunned by that. &quot;...You&#39;ve been locked up in this 
cell for thirteen years?!&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Said the green-haired girl, &quot;...it&#39;s not so bad anymore. They 
don&#39;t treat me bad like they did the others... and they hardly do any 
tests on me these days... I&#39;ve gotten used to it.&quot;

The hacker sighed. How could a girl be trapped inside a research prison 
like this for thirteen years? Didn&#39;t Celaph free all the people that 
Protocol had abused for their research? What was happening here? Yumi 
shook off her confusions once again with a jerk of her head and gazed 
over at Lune once more. &quot;...I can&#39;t believe Protocol&#39;s still doing this 
to people. I know that they did it with me... but that was different. I 
am the Eros... that was something they would have done without fail, 
ethics or not. But wait a minute. Lune, which denomination of them 
locked you up in here? Was it New Protocol or the Holy Empire of 
Protocol?&quot;

Lune stared at Yumi with perplexity again. &quot;...What&#39;s this &#39;Protocol&#39; 
thing you keep talking about?&quot;

&quot;You know, Protocol?&quot; Yumi prodded, &quot;...The global government that 
controls almost everything in the world?&quot;

&quot;Are you talking about the Ashurian Empire?&quot;

Now it was Yumi&#39;s turn. &quot;Huh? Ashurian Empire...? What&#39;s that?&quot;

Lune ran a hand through her green-coloured bangs. &quot;Well I&#39;m not really 
good at... explaining the way... that the world works. I only know what 
the scientists tell me from time to time. They say that the Ashurian 
Empire is the largest empire in the world. In the space city of 
Meshezabel they rule everything. But they didn&#39;t really show up until 
the city of Aryahm was built on the world itself, 60 years ago. Led by 
their ruler, their Queen, they waged war on all the nations of the Earth 
that wouldn&#39;t bow down to them. Then... after the Xu-Canaan War... they 
settled down in Northern Horan. That&#39;s what the Ashurian Empire is... 
from what I learned. There is more to them, I know, but... I don&#39;t know 
anymore than that.&quot;

Yumi&#39;s eyes widened. None of this was making any sense. A war 60 years 
ago? The Ashurian Empire? Yumi couldn&#39;t get around any of it. But Lune 
didn&#39;t look like a liar or a crazy person. There had to be some degree 
of truth to what she was saying in her own away. Maybe it was just some 
fabrications that her captors span on the girl to make it seem as if she 
was living in some kind of fantasy world. Yumi remembered that during 
her time of captivity, her father Dr. Katsuragi Mishima, and his 
assistant, Dr. Shugo Yamamoto; had tried their hardest to keep Yumi from 
learning about the outside world. Maybe this was a similar sort of 
thing. 

A caring, motherly look was reflected in Lune&#39;s eyes. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry I 
don&#39;t know more to help you, Yumi. But you still look a bit tired. Maybe 
you should eat something?&quot;

At that point, Yumi noticed that there was a small chest of drawers by 
her bedside. And on that wooden piece of furniture was a tray full of 
food. It contained a small packet of crackers, eight thin slices of what 
seemed to be ham, a block of cheese, an apple and carton of water. It 
had been seal wrapped and looked more like a packed lunch than a meal, 
but that was probably what the people holding Yumi prisoner had left for 
her.  

Yumi jerked her head away from the tray. &quot;...I&#39;m not hungry...&quot;

&quot;But you really should eat,&quot; Lune suggested seriously, &quot;you need to keep 
your strength up for-&quot;

&quot;I said I&#39;m not hungry!&quot; Shouted Yumi.

Not so surprisingly, Lune silenced herself. Lowering her head with a sad 
look of dejection Yumi instantly regretted her tone when she saw that. 
And made an effort to put it right. &quot;...Look, I&#39;m sorry, Lune I don&#39;t 
mean to yell at you. I&#39;m just a bit confused about things.&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s okay...&quot; Lune said timidly, &quot;...I don&#39;t mind...&quot;

Yumi sighed again, leaning back. &quot;Damn. It&#39;s all just so weird. How did 
I get captured by Protocol? And what about Terry and Sophia and the 
others on the Leviathan? What about Freeman? Did he defeat me and bring 
me here...? What is going on...?&quot;

At that point, the sound of footsteps rustling from the outside of the 
cell door was heard Both Yumi and Lune looked to the door and watched it 
open as someone unlocked it from the outside. Three heavily suited 
guards, dressed in black riot gear, marched into the cell. All of them 
were armed with hand-held laser cannons; dangling off a strap across 
their backs. All three of those guards directed their attentions to 
Yumi.

&quot;Get up,&quot; Guard #3 barked, &quot;we have a use for you now.&quot;

Yumi stood up from the bed in suspicion. &quot;...What&#39;s going on here? Are 
you guys working for Protocol?&quot;

Guard #1 placed his hand to the handle bar of his gun. &quot;If you don&#39;t 
choose to cooperate, we&#39;ll have to use force. Now do you want that? Or 
are you going to be sensible enough to submit?&quot;

Her hands were tied in any case. Yumi was no real hand-to-hand fighter, 
despite her abundance of Qi and prowess in Meta Suits. And these three 
were all armed. If she tried to resist them now, she&#39;d be killed for 
sure. Yumi sighed and nodded her head to assure them that she would 
behave herself while in their care Guard #1 nodded back and removed his 
hand from his gun. Guard #2 extended his hand out the door for Yumi to 
join them. After exchanging a few lingering glances with Lune, Yumi 
exited her cell with three guards around her. They locked the door to 
keep Lune inside; and then led Yumi through the place. When Yumi was 
walking she got a good look at the halls of her environment. It was 
clear that she was in some sort research facility rather than a prison. 
Everywhere she turned she was surrounded by white walls that led into 
private laboratories for experimentation and testing. Eventually she was 
marched up to a lift at the end of the cell corridor She and the guards 
entered and were taken up a floor to a higher level. When the lift doors 
opened and she walked into the new floor, there were windows. Yumi 
walked by them and looked outside to see what was happening there. She 
saw snow and tundra Now she knew at least one thing. She hadn&#39;t gone too 
far from the place at which she had battled Freeman. This was probably 
Antarctica. Judging by the inner shape of the building, it was highly 
unlikely to be Ix Nos Babel. With that one piece of information in mind 
Yumi walked down the hall with the guards around her. They headed to a 
room at the far end of that second corridor. One of the guards fished a 
key card out of his pocket when he came to the door, and he swiped it 
through the nearby control panel. The automatic door opened thereafter 
All four strode into the room. But the slow padding of Yumi&#39;s bare feet 
came to a stop when she looked around it.

The room was huge. A hexagon-shaped metal hall that was about the size 
of her old apartment building in width. In the centre of the room was a 
small monochrome metal chair with a few dials and gauges on it. This had 
to be some sort of testing room. 

Guard #2 pointed at the chair. &quot;Sit down.&quot;

The girl did as she was told and walked over to it. Yumi sat down on the 
metallic chair and placed her arms on the arm rests. There were metal 
clamps around those armrests Yumi gasped when the four of them swung 
around and clutched onto her wrists tightly Though she struggled to get 
free, there was no escaping this predicament. Then when she was gave up 
from the hopelessness of it; a voice called out to her from a set of 
speakers that surrounded the room.

A man with a slightly warped Cantonese accent spoke out, his now voice 
amplified by the loud speakers. &quot;You are Yumi Mishima, correct?&quot;

&quot;Who are you?!&quot; Yumi yelled, &quot;Where am I?!&quot;

&quot;Relax. We don&#39;t plan on harming you. We are simply conducting a few 
tests on you for the time being. Tomorrow morning you will be shipped 
out of the South Shidou Investigative Research Station and transported 
to Aryahm for processing. But until that time... I have a few things I&#39;d 
like to learn about your kind.&quot;

&quot;My kind?!&quot; Yumi shouted.

The man (obviously Chinese in origin) replied. &quot;That&#39;s right. You are a 
former Eros. To this very day, no Eros beside you has ever gone beyond 
her own generation. Your existence alone is a puzzle. The tests I am 
about to run will do nothing to clarify the reasons for your existence. 
But I am most curious... about what secrets your DNA might yield up.&quot;

Whoever this guy was, he was aware of the Eros/Thanatos Cycle. That put 
the idea of these people being connected to Protocol in an unblocked 
cell inside her mind. She was sure that these guys were Protocolians, or 
at least a certain rogue division of it. 

&quot;Didn&#39;t you get enough of this the last time?!&quot; She cried out.

The man took a brief pause, then said; &quot;...You seem to be confused But 
that is quite understandable. From what I&#39;ve seen... you were buried 
very deep in that Qi sphere of yours. Divine Hibernation is a phenomenon 
that shall never cease to amaze me.&quot;

Yumi blinked Divine Hibernation? She remembered talking with Freeman 
about that. It was a periodic sealing in which Ashtars; those tainted 
with the Seed of the Astaroth by descent; could achieve symbiosis with 
the very Heart of the Astaroth. She experienced it before in Ix Nos 
Babel. And she saw it happen to Rain with her own eyes. But if she had 
undergone a second Divine Hibernation, just how long had she been inside 
her Qi orb? While Yumi settled on the chair and pondered on those 
thoughts, the man from the speakers was observing her from the one-way 
window of a completely separate room. It was Long Wu Quan. He stood 
before the long panel of the facility&#39;s super computer, Tigris; watching 
Yumi&#39;s life readings being calculated and displayed on a video screen. 

&quot;Amazing,&quot; He said, his face glowing with the light of the screen, &quot;this 
girl has incredible life readings. Her fundamental Qi Level is at 6,500; 
even though she is not piloting a Meta Suit. Her Bio-Rhythm is at a 78-2  
ratio. Even her brainwaves and Psycho Borders are completely in sync 
with one another. Never before have I seen someone with such high 
readings. Not even the current one...&quot;

A separate voice answered that one. &quot;...That is because she is extremely 
important to this world. Yumi Mishima is an inexplicable anomaly... but 
I think we will all soon know that she persists for a reason.&quot;

Long Wu looked back over his shoulder. &quot;I was wondering when you were 
going to show your face. This one interests you even more than Lune 
does, am I right?&quot;

The figure in the shadows of that room stepped out to reveal himself. A 
man dressed in a black-coloured Asiatic uniform, covered with gold 
Aztec-like patterns. Around his waist was a strap that held an 
ornamental katana to his body. This man, with his firm Japanese looks, 
possessed a wisdom in his eyes that went beyond time. As if he had been 
living a far longer life than anyone else could understand. This man was 
Doctor Geist Fahlem.

Fahlem walked up to the one-way window and looked at Yumi through it. 
She looked as young and lovely as she always did. &quot;...I cannot believe 
that after all this time she hasn&#39;t changed a bit. I knew that the 
Periodic Phase Sealing Phenomenon was a brilliant preserver of life but 
never did I expect something like this. She hasn&#39;t aged a day. It was 
even more effective than I had hoped. Not even cryogenic suspension 
could bring about this effect.&quot;

&quot;What of her Qi?&quot; Long Wu asked.

Fahlem crossed his arms. &quot;If the readings you are taking are correct 
then... it&#39;s even higher than it was back then. But that is 
understandable. After all... she did awaken the Oriax&#39;s true form. And 
to be linked with it for so long... will have lingering after effects. I 
just hope that those after effects are all positive.&quot;

&quot;Extended time in a Meta Suit can be dangerous,&quot; Long Wu commented, &quot;but 
the case is different with her. She was inside the Divine Hibernation 
when synchronized to her suit. Everything should be okay in that 
respect.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t take risks with Yumi,&quot; Fahlem said, &quot;you don&#39;t know her in the 
same way that I do, old friend. The strength of Oriax is not just 
determined by Seraphiel or the Soul Gear Engine. Yumi&#39;s aura is the 
driving force behind its strength. I just do not think that K&#148;hler sees 
it that way.&quot;

Long Wu sneered. &quot;Ugh. That man. He has to be the Schutzenreich&#39;s most 
irritating leader ever. Ever since his grandson vanished he has become 
an even more stagnant man than before. I can&#39;t see the people of 
Jaankang following the coattails of such a man.&quot;

&quot;Gustav K&#148;hler is an oddity,&quot; Said Geist, &quot;but he&#39;s a tactical genius. A 
fact that has not escaped the Ashurian Empire&#39;s notice; hence his 
position But he is not the ultimate concern I have when it comes to the 
Oriax.&quot;

&quot;Then what is?&quot;

Fahlem uncurled his arms. &quot;...I think you already know.&quot;

&quot;...You mean...&quot; Professor Quan&#39;s eyes narrowed, &quot;...&#39;her&#39;...?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;

&quot;But I thought that she was returning to Meshezabel so as to investigate 
that malfunction in the Ragnarok System. What does she have to do with 
something like this?&quot;

Geist pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. &quot;I haven&#39;t a clue. 
But I know for a fact that she was the one to finally request the 
excavation of the Oriax. It is the reason for that order that I am after 
I am actually starting to think that the rumours about her are true.&quot;

Long Wu blinked. &quot;...Is that why you have come for the Mishima girl?&quot;

&quot;...Well, that&#39;s one of the reasons. Right now the most significant is 
that she is the adoptive daughter to an old friend of mine. It is my 
duty to protect her. Doing so is one of my chief concerns. And 
perhaps... doing so might help me along the road to atonement for my 
sins.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Said Long Wu, &quot;and everything is prepared. I hid the 
explosives by wiring a few holographic cubes to Tigris&#39; main system. I 
do not think they will hold out long... especially not when the chargers 
run out... but it should give you enough time to use them before the 
Ragnarok System detects an irregularity. If you plan on helping both of 
them escape then there is no better time than now. Just so long as that 
Aratia woman doesn&#39;t interfere&quot;

Fahlem sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you have to take such risks, Long Wu.&quot;

&quot;You needn&#39;t be,&quot; He said in reply. Long Wu went into his pocket and 
pulled out a small remote control with a single button on it. He tossed 
the control to Fahlem, and he grabbed the device Long Wu finally pulled 
a genuine smile and said, &quot;I have responsibilities of my own. And up 
till now I have managed to cover my tracks. Just make sure you do this 
before midnight. Any later than that and the boat will leave&quot;

Geist nodded to his friend. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Snow was coming down quickly from the cloudy sky. The hard wind that 
suddenly appeared was blowing in from east. Scattering the snow over the 
South Shidou Investigative Research Station. Including, obviously, its 
roof. A thin build up of snow had already taken shape on the roof of the 
building. But that didn&#39;t stop Aratia going up there. Not today, anyway. 
From here she could get a good view of a certain something on the 
horizon not half a mile south. It was a view of the Meta Suit they had 
excavated from the ice hillock to the south earlier that morning. The 
Meta Suit that Professor Long Wu Quan had called the Oriax. 

Aratia stood silently on the edge of the SSIRS roof. A Meta Suit-size 
pickup vehicle was currently driving up from the excavation site with 
the Oriax in its wake. The titanic piece of ancient machinery had been 
strapped and tied down to the carrier by chains and harnesses 
specifically designed to keep Meta Suits in place. All of the materials 
were made from those of the mainland, Horan; which by no coincidence 
happened to be the place to which the Oriax was headed. Shipping Meta 
Suits across the sea was easy when someone was piloting them. But of 
course, they had been given strict orders not to touch the innards of 
that thing until it reached Aryahm. So Aratia&#39;s hands were tied. It 
meant that they would have to get the suit to the mainland via ship. A 
waste of time and money in her opinion; but she didn&#39;t have any say in 
it, no matter what her rank. 

The blonde woman sighed while the snowy wind blow her locks of blonde to 
and fro. While she looked over the landscape and the incoming carrier of 
the Oriax, the door to the compartment room leading back downstairs 
shifted open. A young male soldier, dressed in the same white and blue 
Schutzenreich uniform as Aratia (albeit with a more masculine cut) 
walked out of the doorway and came up to his superior. 

&quot;Greetings, Lieutenant!&quot; He said cheerfully.

Aratia pressed her hand into her hip. &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Sorry to bother you, ma&#39;am. But I was told to find you and tell you 
that the Oriax is on its way from the dig-site. That means that after 
these science boys analyse the thing, we&#39;ll be shipping out with both 
women.&quot;

The blonde Lieutenant turned around. &quot;...You mean that girl we found 
inside the cockpit of that &#39;Oriax&#39; fucker is coming as well? Why wasn&#39;t 
I told about this?!&quot;

&quot;W-we just got word,&quot; The youth admitted, shivering from the cold, &quot;from 
Command Central. The Oriax&#39;s to be shipped to the St. Mary&#39;s Base in 
West Horan, ma&#39;am, instead of Aryahm. Of course that Lune White girl is 
still coming with us all the way to Aryahm, so it means a heavier work 
load.&quot;

&quot;...Shit...&quot; Aratia whispered, &quot;...and I was hoping to flex my Hanuman&#39;s 
muscle on my way back. The Grand Meta Suit Tournament is taking place 
soon. If I have to do this... I&#39;m gonna miss it for sure...&quot;

&quot;Well, Commander K&#148;hler was pretty adamant about it...&quot;

&quot;That old bastard,&quot; Aratia said with a chuckle, &quot;I guess he must mean 
business though. There&#39;s no other reason for someone as beautiful and 
powerful as me to be sent to a shithole like this place.&quot; 

The young soldier smiled bashfully at his superior, then noticed that 
Aratia was standing quite firmly in this cold. While he on the other 
hand, was shivering like no one&#39;s business. The boy breathed out a puff 
of cold air and stared at the unfazed Aratia, saying, &quot;Aren&#39;t you cold, 
Lieutenant?&quot;

Aratia shook her head. &quot;...I don&#39;t get cold.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Yumi couldn&#39;t sleep.

Night had fallen on the South Shidou Investigative Research Station. And 
by this time the setting around the place had changed. Night made the 
station seem less threatening For some reason this made Yumi feel a 
little calmer. But she still couldn&#39;t sleep. It had been about 14 hours 
since she had been sent to that large hall for her life signs to be read 
by that anonymous scientist. Once the tests were over, Yumi was shunted 
back into her cell. She had been told that tomorrow morning she would be 
transported with Lune and the Oriax to a new location. And that if she 
wanted to &#39;enjoy&#39; the rest of her life then she would cooperate with 
whatever was asked of her. Yumi wasn&#39;t about to argue with anyone in 
this position. While the Oriax was out of her possession and this 
Qi-blocking collar was around her neck, there was nothing that Yumi 
could do to stop them. 

However right now; she knew that her life was safe. No matter what 
happened here or anywhere else, it was clear that they wanted Yumi alive 
if anything. Killing her was an option but was obviously one that these 
people would rather avoid. So if she stayed sharp, she&#39;d be fine. No, 
Yumi&#39;s chief concern was for her circumstances. She was being held by 
people she didn&#39;t know. She was in locations unknown (perhaps the only 
thing she did know was that she was being held somewhere in Antarctica) 
and the Oriax was theirs now. These were the things that mattered in 
Yumi&#39;s  mindset at present. Getting out of it was something she could 
worry about later. Her immediate, major concern right now was for an 
understanding of the situation. Which was something that would seem to 
be impossible to attain right now. Lune was pretty much clueless about 
her circumstances and completely passive in regards to them; and the 
tight-nosed guards weren&#39;t the &#39;talkative&#39; type. There seemed to be no 
hope for knowledge of her true predicament

Yumi rolled over on the bed and stared up at the ceiling with her wide 
open blue eyes. Right now she couldn&#39;t help but wonder what her friends 
were doing Especially Terry. The way she had left things with him were 
pretty inconclusive; if you took it from his perspective. That brought 
Yumi to think about his feelings for her. And in turn brought Yumi think 
of her feelings for Chizu. 

The New Protocolian Lieutenant was still very much a permanent fixture 
of Yumi&#39;s mind. Even after what she had done. Even after knowing that 
Chizu was to be married to Celaph. Yumi still found herself thinking of 
her. When Yumi first realized her feelings for Chizu (at that time she 
still regarded the girl as &#39;Chizuru&#39;) she didn&#39;t think of it as love. 
Just attraction. But maybe it  was really more than that. The fact that 
Yumi still found herself thinking of Chizu after all this time... made 
her believe that. But while Yumi distracted herself from her problems by 
thinking of Chizu, things were going on outside. 

Suddenly there was a loud explosion. One that obviously took place on a 
higher floor, but was loud enough to be heard from even that distance. 
So loud in fact that it awoke Lune (a surprisingly heavy sleeper) with a 
start. The gentle girl popped up from her pillow in surprise, grasping 
onto the bed-sheets. 

&quot;W-what!?&quot; She stammered, &quot;W-what&#39;s going on?&quot;

Yumi held a finger to her lips. &quot;Shush!&quot;

Lune quietened down so that Yumi could hear what was going on outside. A 
group of guards, the majority of the ones watching their cell, shouted 
to each other about the explosion Yumi couldn&#39;t make out what was said 
between the lot of them, but when she heard the sound of stomping boots 
growing thinner and thinner; she knew that some of them had left to go 
investigate what had happened. Which left (by Yumi&#39;s judgements) about 
two or three guards left to watch over their door. Then both Yumi and 
Lune heard more coming from outside. It was the sound of a man&#39;s battle 
cries, accompanied by three strokes of a blade. There were three 
gargling death gasps afterwards. Then those groans were joined by the 
sound of that same sword slicing through plastic. The automatic door to 
Yumi and Lune&#39;s cell shifted open. And standing in the middle of the 
doorway with a blood-soaked sword and three corpses by his feet, was Dr. 
Geist Fahlem. 

Yumi and Lune both stared at him, though Yumi was the one to feel the 
familiarity. &quot;...Wait a minute... I know you... you&#39;re the guy who...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no time for that now!&quot; Fahlem yelled, &quot;We&#39;ve only a few minutes 
to escape the facility before we are caught! It is time to leave!&quot;
