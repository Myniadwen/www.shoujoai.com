<h1>All Girls School (part 5 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Our Beloved Faculty&quot;

Fugue. Pipe organ. Haunting, with fear. Holy, with trust. Profoundly 
deep, profanely rough. It condemned the soul and sent the ear wandering 
down a v-shaped path, split over the minor differences that may one day 
set one from another. Phantoms. A toccata. Bach, senior. Her fingers 
floated over her desk, landing in tune to the hum of the organ, whether 
quickly and mad or slow and scathing. Depth, a charge for peace, even 
upon that very first day. She would need the creative patience.

Static.

Hendrix. She smirked. It, too, was classical music. Her fingers mimed a 
guitar.

&quot;Please wait,&quot; she said, noticing the knock on her door. They waited, 
and the song was ended with an abrupt twist. Pity, she loved that one. 
Carefully the woman removed herself from the seat and charged skilled 
fingers for the knob, and a second abrupt twist took her from one world 
to the other. To her, though, both were fanciful, or at least they were 
at that moment. The woman on the other side of the door shone, 
fittingly, like a jewel.

&quot;Harmony,&quot; she sang, embracing the other. The woman who knew her songs 
well put her arms around the person, scarcely seen a few hours ago, and 
smiled wearily.

&quot;Sapphire, I&#39;ve not been gone half a day. Do you need me with you all 
the time?&quot; The other woman, the bejeweled one of similar age, smiled 
with simplicity and love.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Harmony sighed and took Sapphire inside her office.

&quot;Well it is a pleasure to see you, though I&#39;d not like you to come here. 
You&#39;re a distraction.&quot;

&quot;Am I?&quot; Sapphire smiled coyly, raising her eyebrows twice. Harmony let 
out a cautious breath.

&quot;Yes indeed. Look, I&#39;ve no trouble with you in private, but I must 
present myself with discipline here&#151;if nothing else, then to set an 
example to the faculty and students. If I cannot do that, I may as well 
leave.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, we don&#39;t want that,&quot; said Sapphire softly. She leaned forward, 
quickly looked left and right, and kissed her closest and most beloved 
friend of forty years. Harmony smiled shyly.

&quot;That is exactly what I mean. We have been over this before, dear. I 
don&#39;t see why,&quot; she emphasized, sliding the jewel&#39;s arms off her torso, 
&quot;you insist on this&#151;and don&#39;t say just because you love me, or you like 
teasing me.&quot;

&quot;Damn!&quot; she snorted. Harmony chuckled politely, and drew her friend in 
for a more reserved hug. They were interrupted, of course, but at least 
neither one had to scramble to look innocent of any lewd crime.

&quot;Ma&#39;am, I have your papers here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Stephanie. Oh, I would like to introduce my lifelong best 
friend, if I may? We met over 45 years ago and we still hold some 
measure of love for each other.&quot;

&quot;Some?!&quot; shrieked Sapphire. Harmony smiled politely, and bowed to 
Stephanie.

&quot;Ah, excuse her, she doesn&#39;t like getting tastes of her own medicine. 
This is Joanna Langston. Jo, this is Stephanie Dermot, my so-called 
second in command.&quot;

&quot;How do you do?&quot; Both ladies smiled and shook hands; Stephanie spoke 
first.

&quot;I&#39;ve heard so much about you. Bernadette has had nothing but good to 
say of you, Joanna.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s her all the way,&quot; she laughed, &quot;always out for the truth.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not always an angel, dear,&quot; muttered Bernadette. Joanna gave her 
friend a frozen smile.

&quot;Only due to my influences.&quot;

&quot;(Your influences saved your arse in Philly,)&quot; hissed Bernadette 
sharply. Stephanie, who looked like she had overheard them, gave a 
puzzled look.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, did I arrive at the wrong time?&quot;

&quot;Not at all, ma&#39;am&#151;Dettie and I have always been like this.&quot;

&quot;The sad thing is that we only squabble like this when there are people 
around. Alone, we&#39;re like turtledoves.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; vouched Langston. Stephanie stared a bit more, then just 
nodded and accepted it.

&quot;Well, all right. I suppose you&#39;re entitled to leave your friends some 
elbow room. Well, you have your papers there; everything you requested. 
The student body meeting is after lunch, and the campaigns for class 
presidency begin officially&#151;&quot;

&quot;On Friday, September third of this semester, wherein the elections take 
place three weeks later, on the 24th. Yes, I know.&quot; Stephanie&#39;s cheeks 
glowed with pride, already in respectful awe at how quickly the 
headmaster caught on.

&quot;So glad you know. Well, I have other matters to attend to. Must see to 
it that things get done. See you soon, Ms. Marbel, and you, Miss 
Langston.&quot; She bowed her head and left smiling, and once again the two 
ladies had their privacy. Joanna put her hands on her hips and sighed.

&quot;It&#39;s been a long time since anyone&#39;s called me by my birth-name, 
Dettie.&quot;

&quot;Yes, well, it&#39;s a wonder I didn&#39;t blurt out your other name, Jo.&quot; 
Joanna snickered, and even Bernadette could not hold it in and laughed. 
They returned to being Harmony and Sapphire, for a little while at 
least, since Joanna seriously had to go as she really was distracting 
the headmistress from her work.

&quot;Do leave, dear,&quot; she said, sitting down to her papers. &quot;I love the 
visit and am glad of your company, but it&#39;s the first day of school and 
I&#39;ve got papers up to my nose. I don&#39;t need your salacity right now.&quot;

&quot;Well, it becomes equally lonely in the governor&#39;s office, yet you don&#39;t 
pay me nearly as many visits.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what summer&#39;s for, love,&quot; murmured Bernadette quietly, already 
engrossed in her work. Joanna sighed, walked over to the small desk, and 
planted her palms on it firmly. Bernadette stopped and patiently looked 
up to see what the problem was.

&quot;This is how we&#39;re changing the world, Harmony,&quot; said Joanna quietly. 
&quot;We both wanted to have our hand in its development; I&#39;m just a bit... 
disappointed to see how short our range is.&quot;

&quot;Our range isn&#39;t short at all,&quot; stated Marbel, darting her eyes back to 
her work. &quot;You in politics, I in education... we still make a fine team. 
Besides, have you never heard of the pool analogy?&quot;

&quot;Enlighten me.&quot;

&quot;We both went to the same rally,&quot; sighed Marbel, &quot;but I&#39;ll say it again: 
you jump into a pool and create ripples, right? These ripples continue 
going on and on even when you&#39;ve gotten out of the pool&#151;and if there&#39;s 
no wall or friction, they&#39;d probably go on forever. These students,&quot; she 
gestured with her hand, indicating the school in general, &quot;and your 
people may yet spread our teachings and influences further than we 
ourselves could. Who knows: perhaps if we could live much longer lives, 
we&#39;d meet somebody we never even heard of who got their start because of 
us. It&#39;s the ripples I want, Sapphire&#151;not the splash itself.&quot;

The room became quiet, except for the tick of a clock and small chatter 
being carried across the main hall outside the office. Sapphire, having 
not really forgotten the analogy, merely shook her head as she 
understood her friend.

&quot;Of course, of course. Just remember, if you come to the governor&#39;s 
office or manse feeling randy, you won&#39;t receive any comeuppance from 
me.&quot;

&quot;Really, now!!&quot; snapped Marbel in shock, slamming her pencil and hand on 
the desk. Her cracked smile, however, did a poor job of keeping her 
professionalism up.

&quot;I&#39;m kidding,&quot; laughed Sapphire, &quot;I didn&#39;t come here for sex.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, thank God. We&#39;d have to seclude ourselves in a bathroom like 
stupid teenagers.&quot; Both women blushed and held each other&#39;s gaze. Oh, 
the power of a single slipped reference and fleeting glance toward the 
left hallway...

&quot;You want to?&quot; asked Joanna sweetly. Harmony gave her a look too forlorn 
to be thought of as false.

&quot;As exciting as that sounds, I really have too much to do here. You 
understand. It&#39;d be as if you were elected and it was your first day.&quot;

&quot;I may yet get the chance to find out.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t, dear,&quot; warned Harmony sadly. &quot;It would be too awkward being a 
love of my own boss. Besides, we&#39;re equals right where we are&#151;and the 
scandal, Sapphire, if people found out!&quot; Sapphire nodded and had to 
admit, no matter how kinky it sounded, she could not run for an office 
higher than her own.

&quot;That would destroy us. And being caught naked in the women&#39;s bathroom 
of Stanton High School for Girls wouldn&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;Not if we locked the door,&quot; suggested Harmony in song. Sapphire gave 
her a coy smile.

&quot;Oh, bad indeed. We&#39;ll save that lucid deed for another day, perhaps in 
a week?&quot;

&quot;A week would be splendid.&quot;

&quot;Then in a week,&quot; said Sapphire, and she bent down just enough so that 
Bernadette didn&#39;t have to rise very far. They kissed once, twice, and 
again, until they were nearly sure they&#39;d be caught. They bade each 
other a quiet farewell and left for their own duties. When she was alone 
again, Bernadette &quot;Harmony&quot; Marbel laughed quietly.

&quot;Silly woman. I haven&#39;t even been gone from home and you miss me 
already. Silly...&quot;

1969

Washington, D.C.

&quot;These are years of history!&quot; screamed Harmony, a bullhorn in one hand 
and in the other, a picket sign. &quot;America will be remembered for our 
deeds, both in the past and future! The rights of women are changing! 
The rights of blacks are changing! Even as members of our movements are 
being repressed, dozens more take their place and fight! Keep going, 
keep protesting, keep boycotting! Every action will spawn a reaction! 
Rights for all! Peace on Earth! It&#39;s no more than we ask!&quot;

The crowd, stirred by the firebrand, cheered wildly. Sapphire stood up 
and jerked her picket sign towards the White House.

&quot;They have set laws against this and against that, yet how much more 
wiser than we are they? They say that all men are created equal!&quot; The 
crowd booed ferociously, egging Sapphire to continue. &quot;You disagree? Of 
course you do! Segregation and discrimination are hardly equal! I am 
shamed to walk these streets, knowing that there are people who are seen 
as superior to me! Well Nixon can kiss my feministic ass!&quot; Sapphire 
lowered her bellbottom pants and waved her bottom at the White House, 
garnishing even more cheers from the hot crowd. She then joined Harmony, 
locking arms with her lifelong friend.

&quot;Tell Washington that our rights are on paper, clear for everyone to 
read!&quot; they screamed. &quot;And what&#39;s the worst they could do? Arrest us, or 
change the laws?&quot;

&quot;If they do that, I&#39;m deporting!&quot; screamed Harmony. The crowd went wild.

&quot;I&#39;m moving to Canada! I&#39;m going to France! At least in England, we can 
so-and-so! We can do this there! Screw America!&quot;

&quot;And you can tell John Law,&quot; announced Sapphire, stirring them up again, 
&quot;that we&#39;re not bending to his will anymore! This is no longer a man&#39;s 
world, but a world for everyone: black, red, yellow, white, young, old, 
male and female! So take this, Washington! PEACE!!!!&quot; The two women 
immediately locked arms and lips, kissing passionately in front of the 
whole crowd. Everyone ate it up, screaming and chanting a hundred 
different supports. The police force arrived upon the group and 
scattered a few, but Harmony and Sapphire continued to kiss and hold 
each other.

They felt the iron curtain of hands on their shoulders, but did nothing 
save show their love.
Present

Bernadette didn&#39;t expect to hear the same riotous cheer she had once 
been accustomed to during her youth as she faced the student body, but 
times had changed and so had she. The world had aged along with her 
body, but neither appeared ready to slow down or retire. After clearing 
her throat and the light applause, she gave a polite smile to the 
assembly before her. In her eyes, those girls had as much potential as 
she did, all those days ago...

&quot;Good afternoon, ladies,&quot; she began. Some students returned her 
greeting, an act she didn&#39;t quite expect. Well, somebody had taught them 
manners. &quot;Welcome to Stanton Public High School for girls, one and all. 
I am Headmaster Marbel. To you new students, I bid a special welcome and 
hope that all of you find your experience an enlightening one. I vow, as 
passionately as I can, to see that each of you leaves here transformed 
into something far greater&#151;indeed, I hope each of you evolves into a 
better Self. That, in essence, in my opinion, is the entire goal of life 
itself. May you all grow well and flourish.

&quot;To those returning, I bid a heartfelt welcome. I recognize a few faces 
already, and I&#39;m glad your parents enrolled you here again. I believe, a 
bit firmly, that private schools may teach our future leaders greater 
than public schools, yet they still allow great diversity into their 
halls. I welcome the difference; it is this also which makes us human, 
and we must look upon it as a gift for all. I hope I am not the first 
today to emphasize our intolerance to prejudice and bigotry, but if so, 
let me say that I am strictly against it. Differences I embrace, but the 
refusal to accept them and even admire them I do not.

&quot;As this is your first week of school, things shall be light and fair. 
Let me warn you to not grow complacent with this. Things shall change 
here daily, and the road upward and forward shall become tougher. For 
those too weak&#151;well, I am confident that there are none in here. I 
believe you are all strong enough to endure our tests and come out 
shining brighter because of it, each one of you. Well, enough of my 
blathering. Let me introduce you to a few members of our faculty, some 
of whom you&#39;ve had the privilege of knowing a bit:

&quot;First, we have a new mathematics teacher to replace Mrs. Gohn, who 
retired last year. Please welcome Abi Cerio.&quot; The students applauded, 
and Abi came up and said a few formal words before ducking back down. 
&quot;Next, we have a wonderful physical education teacher from Finland, who 
is also coach for our formidable and proud Stanton Badgers, Leena 
Katajisto.&quot; Leena smiled broadly, but kept herself to a wave and little 
more&#151;well, she did scream out a wild &quot;Go Stanton Badgers!&quot; The ensemble 
cheered with her, and even a few of the more strict teachers clapped.

&quot;Ah, thank you. I&#39;m glad the school spirit still lingers here,&quot; resumed 
Marbel, flushed. &quot;Next, we have Hitomi Madsen, whom many of you know has 
shown excellent prowess since her introduction to Stanton two years ago. 
She is strict but fair, and I trust many of you will learn well from 
her.&quot; (Madsen declined from speaking) &quot;Next, we have Emma McGowen, our 
sciences teacher. I know that many of you have heard ill rumors of her, 
but I assure you that they are all false. She is as competent and 
precise as she is charming, and I would not like another in our main 
laboratory. Miss McGowen, a word?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, scratching the side of the nose. She smiled into the 
microphone, and in a dead-on Anthony Hopkins, she whispered, &quot;I cannot 
wait to meet and greet everyone that is interested in my art.&quot;

Applause.

&quot;Thank you, McGowen, you are skilled and creepy as always,&quot; managed 
Marbel awkwardly. A few girls laughed, and she continued. &quot;Next, we have 
Elspeth Post, our drama teacher. I have heard rumor that she is planning 
something special for the school&#39;s productions this year, so if you are 
interested in participating, please see her. Next is Janna Raulson, a 
new but brilliant presence here in Stanton. Normally I would suggest 
that students treat a first-year instructor with gentleness and 
patience, but Miss Raulson has personally proved to myself that she may 
handle any ill situation given her. Just... don&#39;t take her to Vegas.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, ma&#39;am,&quot; called Janna. Some students laughed&#151;more rolled their 
eyes&#151;and Marbel continued.

&quot;Well, don&#39;t worry ladies, we are almost done. And since you&#39;ve all been 
patient, and some of you apparently have difficult homework given to you 
by our fine staff, I shall allow you to leave five minutes early.&quot; The 
group of women naturally cheered and clapped, and were silenced after 
awhile by a beaming Marbel.

There you go, Harmony old girl. Let them see you as fair and just, and 
you shall win their trust.

Headmistress Marbel rounded off a few other key members of the staff, 
from old favorites to people that &quot;those of you thinking you can course 
through this school easily should beware of&quot;, and of course she listed 
every new teacher and stated the passing of retired ones. She ended her 
introductions with Andeira Torvald, a shaky-looking, somewhat 
questionable personage.

&quot;Miss Torvald shall teach foreign languages,&quot; explained Marbel. &quot;She is 
quite skilled in many, so feel free to speak to her any way you choose, 
just as long as it&#39;s respectable. I realize we have many more transfer 
and foreign students this year than before, so it would be great to see 
you and experience what you know. I beseech those of you willing to 
acquaint yourself with these ladies. Make them feel welcome, learn from 
them, and I assure you that your experience will better. Well, that is 
really all I have to say. If you have any problems, please see friends, 
councilors, or trusted teachers; I can only manage the lot of you and 
not individuals. You have my support and guidance from here on out.

&quot;Well, what are you all standing around for?&quot; she called merrily. 
&quot;Students dismissed! Go to your last class of the day and revel in 
having completed the first of many wonderful days. Adieu.&quot;

Bernadette Marbel smiled and bowed, then walked out of the gymnasium 
with the other members of the faculty, save Leena. Most of the bleachers 
emptied out as woman after woman filed away, but a few stayed since P.E. 
was their last class (convenient!). Ivory Tran snorted and stuck her 
nose up at the Headmistress, but this was probably going to be another 
woman not to be trifled with. Best to puff her ego out elsewhere. She 
grinned and winked at Abi Cerio before heading off to the locker room to 
change.

Headmistress Harmony, as only one person called her, breathed out a big 
puff of relief as she collapsed on her couch. That hadn&#39;t been such a 
bad day! Her biggest problem was all that paperwork: the assembly took 
care of itself, and the election, hopefully, would do the same. Having 
the difficult job of managing and guiding an entire school was going to 
get difficult, just as the student&#39;s jobs were going to get more 
difficult, but Marbel didn&#39;t sign up to do something easy.

&quot;I have a feeling that this will be a good year,&quot; she announced out 
loud. Her roommate, lover, companion, and friend answered just a few 
moments before coming into the den.

&quot;That&#39;s good. You do always seem happiest on the first day. By the end, 
though, you look as if you&#39;ve been in a war!&quot;

&quot;Sometimes it is a war,&quot; she sighed, wiping her weary face with a cloth. 
She dug out the pins that held down her long graying blonde hair, shook 
it loose, and sprawled her arms across the sofa. Joanna &quot;Sapphire&quot; 
Langston-Marbel came into the room with two glasses, a bottle of 
champagne, some sandwiches, and a warm smile. Bernadette &quot;Harmony&quot; 
Langston-Marbel grinned and took half the load.

&quot;And how was your day, dear?&quot;

&quot;Splendid, but I&#151;&quot;

&quot;Missed me, I know. You said so at school. You took up my lunch hour.&quot; 
Joanna smiled softly.

&quot;Forgive me?&quot;

&quot;Nothing to forgive, love,&quot; whispered Bernadette, taking her lifelong 
lover into her arms for a gentle embrace. &quot;It was the happy point of my 
day.&quot;

&quot;Well, your day&#39;s about to get a lot happier,&quot; whispered Sapphire 
saucily. Harmony grinned and blushed.

&quot;Oh? And what do you have in mind?&quot; Sapphire purred lustfully, traced 
her finger along her lover&#39;s collarbone&#151;

--and turned on the television. &quot;Friends&quot; was on.

&quot;Damn,&quot; snorted Harmony, &quot;that&#39;s cold.&quot;

&quot;Oh, hush,&quot; snapped Sapphire in return, quickly cuddling against her 
love. &quot;It&#39;s your favorite episode.&quot; Poor Harmony gave in, and decided 
that once again, her wife knew best.</pre>
