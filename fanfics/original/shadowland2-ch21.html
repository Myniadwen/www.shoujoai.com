<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 21 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Jenn and Tanya crossed the academy grounds in silence. The cool wind 
brushed passed Jenn&#39;s bare knees and she pulled her jacket around her 
shoulders and wished that she had chosen something warmer than the skirt 
and blouse, but did not wish to return to the dorm to change. She shoved 
her hands in her pockets, grocery bags around her wrists, and shivered 
against the cold. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Tanya fretted over the way her friend was acting. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot; Jenn snapped, &quot;Will people stop asking me that.&quot; She 
growled, irritated by being asked the same question over and over again. 
She saw Tanya&#39;s face grew long and wished she could take back her words, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She apologized with a sigh of dismay, &quot;I don&#39;t know what is 
wrong with me, maybe it&#39;s my period.&quot; 

&quot;Must be a killer.&quot; Tanya remarked even more concerned at this news, 
&quot;You&#39;ve never snapped at people during your period before.&quot; 

&quot;You remember what I was like during my period?&quot; Jenn asked, intrigued 
and panicked that her friends would keep such a close eye on her mood.

Tanya blushed, &quot;Well, we were roomies for several years after all.&quot; She 
explained simply, hoping that would be the end of that subject. There 
were a lot of things she knew about Jenn that she did not wish to admit 
aloud.  

&quot;Years?&quot; Jenn was startled by this information. &quot;Wait... when did we 
move here? Yesterday you said that we were sort of out-patient at this 
school years ago.&quot; 

Tanya let out a sign, &quot;You still don&#39;t remember, huh?&quot; She inquired.  &quot;I 
thought it was coming back to you in the woods?

&quot;Things are still in pieces,&quot; Jenn explained dismally, &quot;The dates and 
places are still messed up for the most part.&quot; She admitted sheepishly. 

&quot;It was not this school that we were out-patients at.&quot; Tanya corrected, 
&quot;It was another place. We all met there, May, you and me.  I don&#39;t 
remember much about it other then it being a hellish place that parents 
sent their kids when they could not deal with their problems.&quot; 

&quot;I never realized I had any problems until I woke up here.&quot; Jenn 
remarked with a glance at her wrists.

&quot;I think that school caused us most of our problems.&quot; Tanya stated 
dryly, &quot;I wish I knew where my parents were so I could thank them for 
messing my mind up.&quot; She said angrily. 

&quot;So how did we end up here then?&quot; Jenn asked glancing up at the school 
as they walked around the massive structure, &quot;You would think that we&#39;d 
all be sent to some kind of insane asylum or something and not a private 
school like this.&quot;

Tanya simply shrugged, &quot;I do not know what we are doing here.&quot; She 
confessed, &quot;But I&#39;d rather be here then some asylum.&quot; She noted with a 
shudder, &quot;I find this place is more like an orphanage of sorts, but I 
never see any adults around. You came here a long time ago. I remember 
that you disappeared soon after your mother&#39;s death and I thought I 
would never see you again until I was sent here a year later. I was 
happy to see you were living here as well and since we&#39;d known each 
other for so long they allowed us to room together.&quot; She explained in 
one breath. &quot;May arrived much later and was rather upset to have missed 
so many years of your life.&quot;

&quot;So I have been here since I was eleven?&quot; Jenn remarked aloud, &quot;That 
would make me....?&quot; She tried to add up the years in her mind. 

&quot;Seventeen.&quot; Tanya answered, not even surprised that Jenn would be 
asking a question about her own age. 

&quot;Seventeen?!?&quot; Jenn blinked and tried to figure out the math in her 
head, &quot;How is that possible? Where did the passed year go? She was 
almost certain that she was younger then that, &quot;Did I dream about being 
younger? I remember my sixteenth birthday, but not my seventeenth.&quot; 

&quot;Time can get warped in a dream.&quot; Tanya returned, &quot;You have only been 
missing for a few months and yet I bet it feels like a lot longer.&quot; She 
glanced at Jenn&#39;s wrists, &quot;Do you remember what happened yet?&quot; She 
inquired nodding down. 

Jenn shook her head knowing exactly what the girl was talking about, &quot;I 
only remember a lot of blood and something to do with a library.&quot; She 
explained softly.

&quot;I still remember hearing about you cutting yourself. You walked out of 
the doctors office without Amy being aware before I could visit you.&quot; 
Tanya commented in astonishment, &quot;Everyone at the school was searching 
everywhere for you. How did you get stuck in a dream? Kris thinks you 
entered the woods. Do you think that is where we ended up yesterday?&quot;

Again Jenn shook her head, &quot;No idea.&quot; however the woods suddenly seemed 
the most plausible answer to her whereabouts the past while. The other 
day they had only been in the woods a few hours and yet not even an hour 
had passed at the school. She milled this over as they approached the 
Eastern Dorms, &quot;Well here we go.&quot; Jenn stated with a deep breath and 
proceed to enter the building.
