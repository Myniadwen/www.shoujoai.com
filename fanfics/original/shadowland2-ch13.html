<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 13 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Kris helped Jessica into the lobby and to one of the couches, &quot;Careful 
now.&quot; She cautiously lowered her friend down lengthwise on the sofa, 
&quot;Are you going to be alright?&quot; Kris asked apprehensively. 

&quot;I think I just threw out my back is all.&quot; Jessica admitted painfully as 
she rubbed her back. 

&quot;Here let me help.&quot; Kris offered as she sat down behind Jessica.

&quot;No, that is alright.&quot; Jessica began to protest as Kris moved in closer 
until her legs were at either side of Jessica, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine. I just 
need some pain killers.&quot; She remarked gesturing to the office. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Kris comforted Jessica as she pulled the back of the 
girl&#39;s shirt up, &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing.&quot; She placed a hand on Jessica&#39;s 
shoulder and the other in the centre of the girl&#39;s back and pressed her 
thumbs into Jessica&#39;s spine causing the girl to scream out in pain. 
					
&quot;Hey wait!!!&quot; Jessica squirmed in her spot, but found it hard to break 
free of Kris&#39;s grip, &quot;You really don&#39;t have to do thhhaatttt....&quot; At 
first there was a wave of pain, which was quickly replaced by intense 
desire for more. Her muscles relaxed as Kris kneaded out the cramp in 
her back and Jessica started to melt in Kris&#39;s arms.

&quot;You just have a pulled back muscle.&quot; Kris stated as she worked her 
fingers into the girl&#39;s back, &quot;My sister used to get them all the time. 
I learned how to massage them out rather well.&quot; She explained as she 
released Jessica and moved both her hands across the girl&#39;s neck and 
shoulders.

&quot;I... can... seee....&quot; Jessica trembled with a shiver as Kris massaged 
her stiff shoulders. Jessica tried to keep herself from going completely 
limp in Kris&#39;s arms. She felt a heat rise inside of her chest; it 
started at her back and rose up around her neck. She felt it becoming 
hard to breathe and considering stopping Kris, but could not pull away 
from the girl&#39;s sensational touch. Kris&#39;s fingers made Jessica feel 
wonderful, for the first time Jessica felt herself not pulling away from 
someone&#39;s touch, there was no fear or the need to hide. She closed her 
eyes and enjoyed the feeling of Kris&#39;s hands upon her skin.

&quot;You see isn&#39;t that much better now?&quot; Kris grinned while leaning over 
the girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;It may hurt at first but given a moment the pain 
goes away.&quot; 

Jessica nodded in agreement and leaned into Kris setting her head upon 
the girl&#39;s shoulder. She raised one arm, slipped a hand around Kris&#39;s 
neck and ran her fingers through the curls at the back of Kris&#39;s head. A 
new feeling started to overcome Jessica; she wanted to feel Kris&#39;s 
fingers all over her body, wanting to be touched everywhere, outside and 
in. She could feel her control weakening against Kris&#39;s touch and unable 
to resist anymore she rolled her head over on Kris&#39;s shoulder and softly 
kissed the girl on the neck. 

Kris shivered against the feeling of the girl&#39;s fingers and soft lips, 
&quot;Ummm... Jessica...&quot; She stammered as she felt the girl&#39;s leave a trail 
of kisses up her neck to her ear and lightly lick her ear lobe, 
&quot;Ummm...&quot; Kris let out a shivered moan, &quot;Should... should you be 
doing... that...?&quot; She asked with a swallow. She moved one of her arms 
around Jessica as the girl forced her to lean back into the corner of 
the couch, virtually pinning Kris.  

Jessica stared up into Kris&#39;s eyes with a deep intensity. In all her 
years she never felt such a strong desire to be held by another. There 
was something magical about Kris&#39;s presence that forced all her worries 
and fears away. It felt right being in Kris&#39;s arms, like she belonged 
there. Jessica found she could no longer hide her feelings for the girl. 
&quot;I don&#39;t know if we should, but...&quot; She lifted her head and softly 
kissed Kris&#39;s bottom lip, &quot;I know what I want too.&quot; She said with a 
blush. She took Kris&#39;s left hand and placed it upon her breast. 

Kris nervously bit her lips as she let her hand wonder across her 
friend&#39;s breast and listened to the soft moans she made. She watched as 
Jessica rolled her head against her own breast and felt a heat boil up 
inside of her. It had been such a long time since she felt the softness 
of another girl&#39;s skin, since she held anyone in an intimate manner. She 
was so worried about hurting Jenn that she shut off that part of her 
mind, but at that moment she could feel those locks coming undone. She 
found herself unable to turn away from Jessica&#39;s smooth body. The girl&#39;s 
tank top had rolled up exposing her tummy to Kris and she let her right 
hand roam over Jessica&#39;s body and lightly trace along the girl&#39;s 
stomach. 

&quot;Oh, Kris...&quot; Jessica moaned in pleasure, &quot;More...&quot; There was a pained 
sound in her voice. That feeling was rising inside of Jessica&#39;s stomach 
again. At first she felt a pang of fear that was quickly replaced by a 
deeper desire for Kris&#39;s touch. She did not feel guilt about being in 
Kris&#39;s arms. If it were Kris then it would be okay, as long as it was 
only Kris. Giving in to the felling Jessica took Kris&#39;s hand and gently 
guided it downwards,  &quot;Please...&quot; She unbuttoned her pants for Kris. 

Kris&#39;s mouth quivered in anticipation and her mind raced, telling her to 
stop but she wanted more. She watched Jessica&#39;s hips beckon Kris to move 
further south, and her fingers obeyed as they ventured under the band of 
Jessica&#39;s boxers. She was surprised to discover how damp the girl&#39;s 
undergarments were, however this seemed to only excite Kris all the 
more. She continued to allow her fingers to explore until they brushed 
against pubic hairs causing Jessica to bring both of her arms around 
Kris&#39;s neck and nuzzle into her neck, &quot;Please.&quot; She whispered into 
Kris&#39;s ear again, begging for the girl to continue.

Kris turned her eyes from those hypnotic hips to Jessica&#39;s eyes, there 
was a deep hunger in them, &quot;Do you really want me too?&quot; Kris whispered, 
knowing that deep inside she didn&#39;t want to be told to stop. 

Jessica nodded vigorously, &quot;I...&quot; Her voice got caught in her throat as 
she felt Kris&#39;s fingers brush her outer lips. &quot;Oh... Kris...&quot; Jessica 
panted; she wanted Kris inside of her. It was like an ache that her 
entire body desired. 

Kris leaned forwards and kissed Jessica softly on the lips, her heart 
raced at an increasing speed, her mind competing for which could move 
faster. Her eyes scanned over Jessica&#39;s body to find sweat beading up on 
Jessica&#39;s flesh. Kris swallowed hard against the sight as she allowed 
her fingers to work their way under Jessica&#39;s shirt and caress her 
breast. Jessica&#39;s hips tempted her to do more. Kris swallowed again and 
let a finger slip between the girl&#39;s lips and watched as Jessica rubbed 
up against her and let out a moan of pleasure. Kris could feel her 
finger become coated in cum as it pressed against Jessica&#39;s clitoris and 
she could feel a desire growing inside of her. She could smell Jessica&#39;s 
scent in the air and it made her want a taste. It had been so long since 
she sampled the sweetness of a woman. She let her fingers slip deeper 
into Jessica and envisioned cum covering them. She could not stop 
herself and she wanted it all. The guilt forgotten Kris started to pull 
the girl&#39;s pants down with her free hand. 

Jessica squirmed to help Kris free her clothes, &quot;I...  lo-&quot; Jessica&#39;s 
words were cut off as the sound of the front doors opening could be 
heard and Jessica quickly slipped out of view behind the back of the 
couch. 

&quot;Jessica?&quot; Tanya called out as she glanced around the lobby. She spotted 
Kris head peeking out from behind the back of a couch and smiled, &quot;Kris! 
Have you seen Jessica?&quot; She inquired.

Jessica struggled to get her pant back on and shirt pulled down then 
quickly zipped up before she sat up, &quot;I&#39;m right here, Tanya. What can I 
do for you?&quot; She requested, trying hard to conceal her annoyance at the 
girl for interrupting them. 

&quot;I have... my transfer... papers...&quot; Tanya stammered nervously as she 
glanced between the two girls. She could tell that she had walked in on 
an intense situation for Kris&#39;s face was flushed and she was nervously 
running a hand through her tangle of curls, &quot;K... Kris... were you... 
and her... just...&quot; She tried hard not to believe what it was that her 
mind was telling her. 

&quot;N... No....&quot; Jessica rubbed the back of her neck as she walked around 
the couch, &quot;Kris was just working a knot out of my back.&quot; She glanced 
down at Kris who was sinking deep into the couch and hiding her face 
under a pillow. She smiled at Kris&#39;s embarrassment and considered giving 
the girl a light kiss on the cheek then reconsidered, &quot;Let&#39;s see your 
papers.&quot; She ushered for Tanya to follow her to the office, opened the 
blinds and sat upon the small stool before the sliding window. Jessica 
glanced over at Kris another time to see the girl sit up and run her 
fingers through her hair again, the sight of which tugged on Jessica&#39;s 
heart. Could it be she has finally fallen in love? She tried not to 
think about it. She opened the ledger and took Tanya&#39;s papers from her 
hand. 

Tanya could not take her eyes off of Kris. She was almost certain she 
stumbled upon those two making out and the idea distressed her so. All 
she could think of was the sad look in Jenn&#39;s eyes and she wondered if 
Jenn already knew or was this happening behind her friend&#39;s back. She 
tried hard to think of something to say. Something to break the tension 
when Kris shakily got to her feet while holding her head and started 
towards the cafeteria doors. 

&quot;You alright there Kris?&quot; Jessica asked with even more concern. She bit 
her lip at the sight of the girl staggering across the room. 

Kris waved a hand at Jessica, &quot;I just need to go to the washroom.&quot; She 
lifted her head and forced herself to smile at the girl, &quot;I&#39;ll be right 
back.&quot; She assured as she pushed through the double doors and headed 
straight for the washrooms at the back of the cafeteria. 

The washroom door banged opened as she rushed inside and sought out the 
sink. She set her hands on the counter and took a deep breath. Her mind 
was racing, emotions she had not faced in years were surfacing from 
their jails and she did not like this one bit. She glanced at her 
reflection in the mirror. 

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; She asked the image before her, setting her 
forehead against the mirror, &quot;You love Jenn. You can&#39;t be doing this.&quot; 
She reminded herself, &quot;I promised her. That I would stay at her side 
forever.&quot; She slowly shook her head as tears filled her eyes, &quot;It is not 
fair!&quot; She punched the wall. &quot;Why does life have to be like this?&quot; She 
turned away from her image and leaned against the counter with her arms 
crossed, &quot;What do you want anymore?&quot; She asked herself, thinking of the 
way that Jessica looked at her. She had to admit that she did feel 
comfortable around the girl, not the way she was with Jenn, and yet 
Jessica had been at her side since they arrived at the Dorm. She claimed 
that she was told by Kris&#39;s aunts to watch over her, but all the same 
she did not have to follow her into the woods or try to ease her misery. 
Always watching over her with that concerned look in her eyes. 

Kris glanced up at the ceiling, &quot;Jessie, Is this one of your games?&quot; She 
asked no one at all. She brought her fingers to her nose and smelt them. 
That sweet sharp scent was still there and it made her mouth quiver. 
Swallowing hard she lightly licked some of the cum off and savoured the 
taste. She stopped herself, she spun around, washed her hands in the 
sink, then filled them with water and splashed it on her face. She 
shivered at the coldness, and then glanced once again at herself in the 
mirror. She needed to know if Jessica was being serious or was Kris 
another of the girl&#39;s play toys. With that she pushed off the counter 
and headed back. As she re-entered the lobby she found Jessica writing 
in the ledger. 

&quot;Kris!!&quot; Jessica glanced up from the book and smiled, &quot;Are you feeling 
alright?&quot; The smile quickly turned to a frown as she noticed the serious 
look on the girl&#39;s face. There was intensity in Kris&#39;s eyes that Jessica 
had not seen before. Jessica glanced at Tanya. If Tanya also noticed 
Kris&#39;s glares then she was not commenting. Tanya actually seemed to be 
deep in her own thoughts at that moment. 

Kris walked directly into the office, set her hand down on the counter 
next to the ledger and leaned in close to Jessica. Jessica found it hard 
to take her eyes off of the girl&#39;s. Kris seemed to be thinking over what 
she was going to say. She glanced from Jessica to Tanya and back again 
then moved slightly closer to Jessica, &quot;Jessie...&quot; She started, &quot;We need 
to talk.&quot; There was a sense of urgency in her tone and Jessica felt 
herself growing increasingly more nervous. Did she do the wrong thing? 
Did she finally go too far? Her heart pounded and she could feel a 
terrible aching feeling at the thought of losing Kris so soon after 
experiencing the comfort of being in her arms. She started to rise when 
Kai and the others returned.   

&quot;One Bugbear exterminated!&quot; Kai exclaimed as she hopped down the stairs 
into the lobby. 

Kris glanced through the office window at her sister then back at 
Jessica, &quot;Later.&quot; She stated then left the office. 

Jessica let out a deep breath that she wasn&#39;t even aware she was 
holding, &quot;Okay.&quot; She swallowed hard then turned back to Tanya, whom was 
now glaring at her, &quot;Sorry about that...&quot; She apologized, trying to 
ignore the girl&#39;s stares as she picked up Tanya&#39;s move notice and filled 
it out.

&quot;How&#39;d things go?&quot; Kris probed her sister as she crossed the room. She 
was surprised when Kima came down the stairs with a girl in her arms, 
&quot;What happened? Who is she? Is she alright?&quot; Kris rushed to Kima&#39;s side 
to help her carry the girl to the couch, &quot;Jessie!!&quot; Kris called out. 

Jessica quickly ran over with Tanya close behind her, &quot;Penny? What 
happened?&quot; She scanned the gathering group of girls in search of 
answers.

&quot;Kima just gave the girl a small heart attack.&quot; Kim stated coldly, &quot;I 
can&#39;t believe you at times.&quot;

Kima gave her twin a cold glance, &quot;How was I to know she would faint?&quot; 
She defended as she placed the girl gently down on the couch. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you know anything about Dreamers?&quot; Kai remarked in frustration, 
&quot;You never reveal who you really are when they wake up. I though a 
powerful Walker like yourself would know something like that.&quot; 

Kris glanced from Kai to Kima then back to her sister, &quot;Are you sure she 
is a Walker?&quot; She asked in confusion, &quot;That would explain a lot.&quot; She 
noted.

&quot;All three of them.&quot; Kai pointed from Kima to Kim and then Alyson, &quot;The 
twins are really powerful ones I might add. I&#39;ve never seen anything 
like these two. Where did you find them?&quot; She inquired with extreme 
interest.

&quot;Well...&quot; Kris scratched the back of her head trying to figure out how 
to explain the past few weeks events, &quot;It is a looonnggg story.&quot;

Jessica interjected, &quot;One that would probably take an entire novel to 
explain and still not make much sense.&quot;

Kima glanced up at Jessica, &quot;Who is she? I thought everyone went off to 
school already.&quot; There was concern in her eyes and voice.

Jessica knelt beside Penny and examined the girl, &quot;Penny is a special 
case.&quot; She explained, &quot;She arrived here only weeks before you all. She 
had a serious case of agoraphobia and we couldn&#39;t lure her out of her 
room no matter how hard we tried. She would just sit up there playing 
the same old waltz over and over again.&quot; Jessica placed a hand over her 
mouth in thought, &quot;It was like she wasn&#39;t really there. Always partly in 
a dream.&quot; She half mused.

&quot;That was until idiot here rudely snapped her out of it.&quot; Kai stated in 
distaste, &quot;What did you think you were doing?&quot; She demanded of Kima 
angrily.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t help myself.&quot; Kima admitted sheepishly, &quot;I found myself 
drawn into the moment. It was just an innocent kiss.&quot;

&quot;It was innocent until you shattered the poor girl&#39;s dream world.&quot; Kai 
growled, &quot;You could have caused her sever harm. How would you feel if 
you dreamed about being saved by your prince only to find out that your 
prince was actually a girl?&quot; 

&quot;I would be happy.&quot; Kima admitted with a smile and nod. 

Kai stomped angrily over to Kima, having to look up at the girl because 
of her shortness, &quot;How do you know she is even gay!?!&quot; She demanded 
pointing at the sleeping girl. Flames were beginning to leap across 
Kai&#39;s arm.

Kris grabbed her sister around the waist and pulled her away, &quot;Calm down 
sis. Kima is a difficult case to understand. I&#39;m sure she thought what 
she was doing was right.&quot; Kris remarked not really believing a word of 
her own comment. 

&quot;Like that girl would ever think instead of following her hormones.&quot; 
Alyson snorted, &quot;That would be a first.&quot; 

&quot;Oh will you leave me alone for once.&quot; Kima asked wearily, rubbing her 
head, &quot;I screwed up. I admit it. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Do you really think you can just apologize and everything will all go 
away?!?&quot; Alyson boomed, &quot;Your hands were down Natalie&#39;s pants!!&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t seem to protest.&quot; Kima explained irately as she rose to her 
feet, &quot;Maybe you weren&#39;t giving her what she wanted.&quot; She said with a 
mischievous grin. 

&quot;Why you fragmented illusion.&quot; Alyson unsheathed her sword; &quot;I&#39;m going 
to finish you off like I should have the moment I first laid eyes on 
you.&quot; She pointed the sword at Kima. 

&quot;Hurt me and you&#39;ll be hurting Natalie too.&quot; Kima explained with a 
sneer, &quot;Come on. How far do you want to push her away?&quot;

Jessica leapt between the two girls and held her arms out, &quot;That is 
enough out of the both of you.&quot; She yelled in a commanding voice that 
stopped both girls dead in their tracks. She turned her gaze to Alyson, 
&quot;Alyson!&quot; She gave the girl an irritated glare, &quot;You know the rules 
here. Sheath that sword before I confiscate it and any other blade you 
may have been hiding in your room.&quot; 

&quot;Fine!&quot; Alyson did as she was told and stormed out of the room, &quot;We will 
finish this later daemon.&quot; She hissed. 

&quot;That is fine.&quot; Jessica agreed, &quot;Just keep it off school ground is that 
clear!&quot; She kept her eyes on Alyson until the girl disappeared up the 
stairs. When she was sure that Alyson was not going to return she turned 
her attention on Kima, &quot;Now as for you.&quot; She snapped, &quot;I don&#39;t care if 
you are part of Kim&#39;s persona or whatever it is you claim to be. You are 
here out of the kindness of the Head Mistress&#39;s heart and I want you to 
treat everyone here with the respect they deserve.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Kima started to protest. Her eyes darting around in search of 
someone to defend her, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean too...Why am I always to blame?&quot; 
She pleaded, and there was a lost look in those red eyes.  

&quot;I know.&quot; Jessica&#39;s anger melted away as she sympathised with the girl&#39;s 
plight for she to had been in Kima position on more then one occasion. 
She took a quick glance at Kris and let out a sigh, &quot;Trust me I know...&quot; 
She patted Kima on the shoulder, &quot;However you must realize that your 
presence here causes a lot of tension so please try to not provoke 
things more.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kima bowed her head in shame and turned to gaze upon 
Penny&#39;s sleeping form, &quot;I really didn&#39;t mean to harm anyone.&quot;

&quot;We all mean well.&quot; Jessica said understandingly. She glanced at Kris 
again then quickly away, &quot;Now there is no way to change the past so 
maybe we can find a way to help the girl. So let&#39;s stop arguing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kim bowed her head in guilt over her out burst.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry too.&quot; Kima sat down on the couch next to Penny, &quot;What do we 
do about her?&quot; She wiped a lock of wavy hair out of Penny&#39;s eyes. 

As if some unheard spirit heard Kima&#39;s pleas the front doors opened and 
Amy walked in with a black bag in hand, &quot;Kim, Kima, I&#39;ve been looking 
for you too.&quot; She exclaimed happy to see the two redheads together.

Kim backed away from the nurse and clenched her arm, &quot;You have?&quot; She 
asked nervously running a hand through her short hair. 

&quot;Actually I had a feeling that I was needed.&quot; Amy explained as she moved 
across the lobby till she saw Penny, &quot;What happened to her?&quot; She 
inquired as she quickly rushed around the couch and knelt next to the 
girl.

&quot;She was rudely awakened by Kima here.&quot; Kai explained crossly, this time 
with no protests from the redhead. 

&quot;Kima?&quot; Amy glanced at the girl who lowered her head and rubbed her arm, 
&quot;Is that true?&quot; She inquired gently. 

&quot;Yes...&quot; Kima admitted even more ashamed of herself, &quot;I didn&#39;t know she 
would faint. I just wanted her to know that it was me.&quot; 

Amy turned to examine Penny while pulling a penlight from her pocket and 
shone it in the girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;She seems to be just sleeping.&quot; She noted 
opening up her bag, &quot;Has she been out long?&quot;

&quot;A few minutes.&quot; Kima replied, she nibbled on her bottom lip, &quot;Will she 
be alright?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll give her some time to wake up and see.&quot; Amy replied, taking out a 
needle and tapping it a few time before inserting it in Penny&#39;s arm and 
pressing the plunger, &quot;This should help her a little.&quot; She explained 
then turned to Kima and Kim, &quot;While we wait why don&#39;t I look over those 
wounds of yours?&quot; She offered with a warm smile as she moved to an empty 
couch and patted it. 

Kima and Kim nervously stood still. Kima was the first to step forward, 
&quot;Alright...&quot; She sat on the couch and offered her bandaged arm to the 
nurse. 

&quot;That is a good girl.&quot; Amy smiled and took a pair of scissors out of her 
bag and started trimming away the old bandage then glanced around the 
room. This could not be the reason for her worries. There must be 
something more, something waiting to happen and this was only the 
beginning. She knew what would come after would be much worse.
