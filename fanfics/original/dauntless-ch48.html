<p>“Epitaph: the artist’s true heart”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Epitaph, Shana Suing’s home world and the destination  for the next stage of the journey, was a fairly ordinary world  considering the variety available. The only really unique thing about  it was that there were very few “short” people walking around;  Shana was a rare example and so she had felt left out. Then again,  this isolation did spark her interest in learning, memory, art, and  solving puzzles, so it wasn’t a complete loss. However, there was  also a considerable amount of racism, xenophobia, and discrimination  on Epitaph; it was almost universal. The worst part was that there  was no good excuse for this anachronism: the world was considered up  to date in terms of technology, government, and learning, but their  mindset was still primitive. Shana had fought hard to keep herself  from joining the crowd.</p>
<p>Epitaph had many small villages, and very little  desert, making it ideal for agriculture. It had an impressive ocean,  the Strafdat, and lands full of fertile plains and forests. There was  one main city, given the uninspiring name of Epitaph Central, and the  other cities were either branches around the world, or villages and  colonies. There were no countries or regions because a single world  dictator governed everything. Most of the “branch cities” were  very poor or corrupt, and Shana had the misfortune of living in one,  cramped inside a small apartment with her two older brothers, three  older sisters, and her younger brother, Allen, the only one she  genuinely loved. Despite the number of cities, most of Epitaph  remained unknown, and there are large numbers of underground  passageways that had never been explored. Many legends of “monsters”  living in these passages arose over time, but stories like that  circulate everywhere; no civilization is without its urban legends.</p>
<p>As soon as they arrived, everybody disembarked and  stretched their limbs: it was nice walking around a world without any  considerable danger for a change. Because Shana knew this place the  best, everyone looked to her to guide them around, but there was very  little she could say about it she hadn’t pointed out already. She  did note that the docking bay was rather sparse, even with the  relatively low tourism, so twenty-three newcomers and one prodigal  daughter was something significant. Epitaph hadn’t seen such an  influx of outsiders in years.</p>
<p>“We used to get all our income from tourists,” she  explained, “but now that we’re in a recession, we’ve turned to  the ocean for our resources. It’s not an enormous problem, of  course— we’ve got plenty of agriculture and domestic trade— we  just have to tighten our belts a little and take care of what  resources we have left. You’re all free to look around— you’ll  be treated fairly well since we don’t usually get outsiders— I’m  just going to visit my brother. I’ve got a lot of artwork to show  him!”</p>
<p>“He’s the young man with the illness,” Fuuka  stated solemnly. Shana nodded. “If you don’t mind, I’d like to  come along and diagnose his symptoms.”</p>
<p>“That would be fine, but it’s getting to the point  where I’m starting to lose hope.”</p>
<p>“I know just how you feel,” she replied forlornly.  Herut wedged her way through the crowd and tugged on Shana’s arm.  She was afraid that by now, her feelings for the young woman would be  in vain, that she had chosen Mink to love and merely thought of Herut  as a friend, but… Even if that was true, she still loved Shana and  wanted to understand her own feelings more. She was supposed to be a  maintenance and repair unit; she wasn’t mean to feel much of  anything. And perhaps she still had a chance! She had to risk it, if  only to realize her identity and come to grips with who— and what—  she was turning into.</p>
<p>“Could I come too?” she asked meekly. Shana’s  dour face turned bright all of a sudden. If only Herut knew how much  she warmed her heart!</p>
<p>“Of course, I’d love to introduce you to my family!  Let’s go find a trolley.”</p>
<p>“What’s a trolley?” Shana pointed to the roads,  where large boxlike cars traveled across wires and rails.</p>
<p>“Those are,” she said. “Epitaph ran out of fossil  fuels and crude oil long before I was born, so we were forced to rely  on other sources of energy. These trolleys run on electricity, and do  you see those?” She pointed to a fleet of yachts sailing through  the air; they looked like crescent moons. “They utilize the wind to  move around. Bicycles and steam-propelled engines have resurfaced in  popularity, and we even have a few solar vessels. Say, what are the  rest of you going to do while we’re gone? I’m afraid that Allen  can’t receive too many visitors in his condition, so you’ll have  to find something else to keep you busy.”</p>
<p>“That won’t be easy with our cute tour guide gone,”  Lil purred. Shana giggled nervously.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure you’ll manage on your own. Let’s  meet back here by about noon tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“You won’t stay any longer?” Fuuka asked. Shana  smiled up at her.</p>
<p>“Allen wouldn’t want me tied down here with him.  Besides, I’ve got more worlds to draw, and…you know…I want to  see the most beautiful one before he…passes on. I’m just  visiting.”</p>
<p>“But we’re in no rush.”</p>
<p>“We’re really not,” Eve said as she uncrossed her  arms. “I mean, it’s not as if we have a lot to go on. Um, you  know, with all this Origin stuff going around. We can stay another  day.”</p>
<p>“I guess that settles it, then!” Fuuka beamed.  “Let’s meet here by evening in two days.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Shana giggled. “I didn’t want to  sound presumptuous by proposing a deadline.” And so the three of  them found an available trolley and rode off in one direction, while  the crew separated according to their tastes and desires. Mink  lingered for several minutes, declining to join anybody, wondering  what she should do about the current situation. She couldn’t help  but wonder why Shana had not invited her. Had their brief, rebellious  night together meant nothing? Did they defy Vimmy and consummate  something special in vain? Maybe Shana didn’t want to expose  someone so precious to her brother’s fatal illness— but why bring  Herut? Mink understood that Shana loved the other woman just as much,  and was happy for her— but even so, she couldn’t help but feel  the tiniest bit envious. Mink ultimately decided to believe that  Shana just wanted to spend some time alone with Herut, and she would  come back to her eventually.</p>
<p>“Wait for me!” she called, running after the last  trolley.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“There’s something I have to warn you two about  before we go any further,” Shana said as the trolley dropped them  off at their destination. “It’s about my family, see. Allen, my  brother, and daddy…they’re both good people, and I’m sure  you’ll like them. But I have two older brothers and three older  sisters who are…uh, I really hate to say it, but they’re pretty  much scum. They’re either into drugs, into gangs, or both, so if we  happen to run into them, just stay out of their way. My mother’s  not quite as terrible, but she is an alcoholic, and she will curse at  you if you do anything…well, let’s just say that she’ll curse  if you do <em>anything</em>.” Shana had a dead-serious expression;  the years of torment she spent in that squalid apartment, trapped  with a family of degenerates, had been hidden well behind her sunny  exterior.</p>
<p>“I had no idea,” Herut murmured as she realized  just how strong her best friend was. Shana smiled feebly.</p>
<p>“It’s not the sort of thing you can talk about that  openly. We’re also fairly poor, Fuji-sama, so don’t expect any  payment for your services.”</p>
<p>“I could never dream of asking you for anything!”  she exclaimed in shock. “Any real doctor wouldn’t let a thing  like finances get in their way!”</p>
<p>“Well, Epitaph is just that corrupt,” she  explained. “But even so, the only reason I left was so I could see  the universe and what it has to offer, then show it to my brother,  since he can’t even leave the house. Unless you can pull out a  miracle— um, I mean, something extraordinary— Allen won’t  survive for very long.”</p>
<p>“I always did value actions over prayers and divine  intervention,” Fuuka said. “But considering what we’ve been  through, I’m prepared to open my mind a bit. Tell me what he was  like before you left him.” Shana filled them in as they walked the  rest of the way. Thanks to the dystopian government, the abuse and  neglect of natural resources, and the allocation of funding to the  wealthy few, most of Epitaph’s cities were in ruin or else on the  verge, and very few people still made their homes in the ramshackle  shanties and dilapidated constructs. Some moved out to explore the  unknown country in a desperate hope, while others sold themselves  into servitude— or else gave up entirely. The only reason Shana’s  family lived in relative comfort was due to their illicit actions. In  a city congested with dismal morals and greed, drug dealers and gangs  were the only trades that prospered.</p>
<p>Herut, meanwhile, clung to Shana with newfound  appreciation and humility. She wondered how she could ever be selfish  enough to worry about her own feelings when her closest friend was  going through so much inner torment— and she kept her smile on in  spite of everything! She had only tasted the darker side of life in  her secluded, safe world of transport repair and maintenance: Shana  had to live with this filth all her life. And all she wanted was to  send Allen away in peace, with the universe spread out before him in  perfect illustrations! Herut wept and held Shana’s hand; she didn’t  know her questions about her humanity were being answered.</p>
<p>“It looks like we lucked out!” Shana exclaimed  cheerfully as she approached her neighborhood. “The only ones home  are daddy and Allen. It’s that little gray one over there.”</p>
<p>“They’re all gray,” Fuuka said. Shana giggled.</p>
<p>“Right, right. Ours is the one with the white and  green graffiti. Hey, daddy finally fixed that window! Someone threw a  brick into that window a few years back. That’s a piece of good  news.” She led them up the crumbling staircase and through the  front door, knocking quietly.</p>
<p>“Is your father expecting us?” Fuuka asked.</p>
<p>“Well, I told him I’d be back eventually, but I  never said when. He’d probably just pretend I had only been gone  for a few hours. Daddy, I’m home! It’s Shana!”</p>
<p>“It’s a nice home,” Herut mumbled, trying to make  the best of things. Shana’s influence stood out like the proverbial  diamond in the rough, as patches of color exploded out from the walls  and certain pieces of furniture, giving pale life to the drab  apartment. It stank a little, but most of the odor came from the  plumbing, which had been broken for a week. Shana’s father was  apparently trying to mask it with some cooking, and as Shana stuck  her head through the kitchen, he waved at her as if she had never  even left the building.</p>
<p>“Hey, great to see you! Glad you could make it:  tonight’s dinner is grilled duck. I actually caught one live out in  the wilderness!”</p>
<p>“Oh, cool! So what’s it like out there?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what those weasels in Central are  doing,” Mr. Suing growled, gesturing towards the door with his  tuning fork. “They’ve been proposing a new development plan that  will take all of us poor saps into the wild where we’re supposed to  be building a better community. We all know they’re only doing it  because they’ve drained this half of the world dry, and now they’re  going for the other half. Vicki was actually out there protesting!”</p>
<p>“My oldest sister,” Shana explained. “I’m not  surprised at all; she always was an activist. Uh, Vicki goes out into  the wild and…uh, well, she harvests illegal substances.”</p>
<p>“It’s the least offensive thing I’ve seen in a  long time!” Father Suing said, adding more seasoning and herbs to  his pot. It smelled fairly nice, but his efforts were hopeless: the  plumbing was downright acrid. As he returned to his meal, Father  Suing muttered, “So who’re your friends? I see a lil’ lady  about your age and…uh, size, and a woman that looks like a fox.  That’s not a costume, is it?”</p>
<p>“No sir, I’m a Kitsune.”</p>
<p>“A what?”</p>
<p>“A fox-person, sir. We evolved from the foxes just  like you humans evolved from— ”</p>
<p>“I don’t mind any of that evolution crap, but I  suppose not all the aliens can be little green men…or little green  women.”</p>
<p>“Actually, sir, one of our crew does have green  skin,” Herut said.</p>
<p>“Your crew? Oh, that’s right! You went to sign up  for Dr. Miracle’s voyage for treasure!” He put his utensils down  for a moment to face them, smiling as he dried his sweaty face. “So  how was that like? Is Dr. Miracle as terrifying as they say? What was  the treasure? Did you see a lot of worlds? Is it too much to ask if  you found something to help Allen?”</p>
<p>“Uh, maybe we’d better talk over supper, daddy,”  Shana said. “You’re kind of flustering me with all these  questions. They’re not easy to answer.”</p>
<p>“Apparently not, considering you look tougher and  smarter than when you left. Well, I won’t be done for awhile, so go  say hello to your brother. Now who are these people again?”</p>
<p>“My friends,” she explained as she made  introductions. “This is Herut, a girl that works maintenance and  repairs. We wouldn’t be where we are without her help. And this is  Fuuka Fujiwara, or just Fuji-san, a doctor.”</p>
<p>“Pleased to make your acquaintance,” he smiled,  bowing politely. “So, a mechanic and a doctor, huh? Did you bring  her here to see Allen?”</p>
<p>“Well, not specifically, but she said she’ll give a  diagnosis.”</p>
<p>“I can’t make any promises, sir,” Fuuka replied.  Father Suing shrugged and went back to his cooking.</p>
<p>“Just making Allen’s day a little brighter is all I  ask for, and Shana’s probably going to take care of that. If you  three are all that’s there, then you’re welcome to some supper. I  reckon Deena and the kids might not show up today. Heck, Vicki’s  probably in jail again! Well, at least she’s standing up for  something. Anyway, I’ll call you when supper’s ready.”</p>
<p>“Okay, thanks daddy! C’mon, I’ll show you to my  brother.”</p>
<p>The family resemblance between Allen and Shana Suing  was strong, even though there was a difference in age…and height.</p>
<p>“Don’t make fun,” Shana groaned as Allen ruffled  her hair. He was only thirteen, yet he towered over his smaller,  older sister.</p>
<p>“Hey, I haven’t seen you since you ran away. I  deserve a little brotherly abuse. What I’d like to know is why you  came back! Turning tail was the smartest thing you could’ve done,  Shan.”</p>
<p>“But I told you I’d be back to give you my  pictures. You made me promise, remember?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but here’s the thing: there’s this new  invention called the mail. You can send packages with it and stuff.  Why, you can even send me all your portraits over the computer!”</p>
<p>“But what good would that do if I’m not here to  show them to you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, there’s also this thing called a letter.”</p>
<p>“Stop being such a brat,” she moaned cutely. “And  stop messing up my hair! I came all this way just to show you all  these beautiful worlds…”</p>
<p>“I know,” he grinned impishly. “That was the  welcoming reception. So who are your friends? They’re cute! I hope  they’re single.”</p>
<p>“They’re both way older than you,” Shana  grumbled. Fuuka laughed at them, and even Herut finally cracked a  smile.</p>
<p>“I’m flattered, but spoken for. Shana, your brother  is too adorable! I can see the family resemblance.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a dominant trait,” she explained.  “Daddy and Allen are the only good apples in the bunch.  Well…Vicki’s not <em>too</em> bad if you catch her when she’s  clean.”</p>
<p>“We’re adopted!” Allen sang triumphantly.  “Actually, we’re aliens from the planet Dwixl, invading the  bodies of the unworthy for our crazy mad science experiments!”  Fuuka laughed again; she was glad to see Shana’s terminal brother  in such good spirits. He reminded her of herself, so very much…</p>
<p>“If only,” Shana sighed. “Anyway, this is Herut  and Fuuka. Herut and I became best friends during our journey, and  Fuuka’s sort of like a big sister to me. She’s a very famous  doctor, so please behave yourself, at least for an hour.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to be watching the seconds closely,”  he warned, pointing to an old clock hanging on his wall. “You have  exactly three-thousand six-hundred of them to spare, doctor, before  I’m free again. Of course, if you’ll go out on a date with me, I  might extend them…or who knows! I might just give you less, if  that’s your thing!”</p>
<p>“He’s so cute!” Fuuka squealed, giving Allen a  hug. Shana giggled and admitted she was right (sometimes), while  Herut stood off to the corner, smiling patiently. As Fuuka was  examining Allen for his terminal illness, Shana put on a show for  him, pulling out all her portraits and landscapes, describing each in  turn. Along with the crew, of which was a greater interest to Allen  in the long run, she showed him every world they had visited since  the journey began: Strategos, the comet, Sargasso, Bibliopolis,  Olria, Reversa, Sekhamank 4, Amazonia, Tigris, Rajani, New London,  Cumulus, the Hagan system, the nameless primitive world, Saigrim,  Necropolis, the Space Station, and finally, Hallow’s Point around  Silvanus.</p>
<p>“So what’s the verdict, doc?” Allen said. Fuuka  gave him a sad smile and caressed his face.</p>
<p>“It’s a terminal degenerative disease that slowly  affects the nerves. I expect you only have less than two years left  to live. Soon it will affect your spine and you won’t be able to  walk on your own anymore.”</p>
<p>“Is that all?” he said calmly. “Hmm. And here I  thought it was serious.” Fuuka stared at him in awe, blinked, and  couldn’t help but grin: his resilience was remarkable.</p>
<p>“That sounds like the one you’ve got,” Herut  said. Allen raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p>“You mean she and I have the same illness? Isn’t  that weird! I guess…I should welcome you to the club! It’s very  exclusive, you know, but we get the best care and company around!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said, her voice strained as she began to  cry. Fuuka put her arms around Allen and let the tears flow. “You’re  absolutely right, darling. We have the best there is.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“What’s eating you?” Eve said as she glanced at  Mink. “You look more down than usual.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s not so bad. You musts till be mourning  for your friend.”</p>
<p>“Nah,” she smiled gently. “Zeta wouldn’t want  me crying for him. Besides, I’m happier than I am sad. I just found  out I got a real family. It’s not every day your dream comes true.”</p>
<p>“Your dream?” Eve blushed and scratched her cheek  bashfully.</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah… Listen, I know it sounds really dorky,  but the one thing I wanted more than anything else was a family that  loved me. I had a xenophobic turd for a father and an iceberg for a  stepmother. It…kind of rubbed off on me. Hey, if I ever caused you  offense, I’m real sorry. I want to start being a better person  now.” Mink’s lips curled upward very slightly, a sharp change in  mood for her.</p>
<p>“You’ve never caused me any trouble. I’m glad you  decided to change. And…I’m glad I decided to come along.”</p>
<p>“Everybody came along,” Eve replied simply. “And  I can’t blame them. It’s about time we ran into a <em>normal</em> world.”</p>
<p>“That isn’t what I meant,” she said, giggling  very quietly. Eve asked her about it, but Mink was resting her head  on her shoulder, sleeping peacefully, trusting Eve to care for her  until they reached their destination. She hesitantly put her arm  around the taller woman and snuggled a little closer.</p>
<p>“Oooh,” Kyrie squealed. Kasberry snorted.</p>
<p>“Shut up.” Their trolleys soon sojourned at a  transit station, just long enough for everyone to get out, get a  snack, relieve themselves, or just take in the sights. Passengers  came and went, but three in particular looked awfully familiar,  especially to Sharyn and Lyara. The younger one had a very tragic,  ethereal beauty on her face: she was as pale as the clouds  themselves, fair but with curly hair darker than the storms, and she  had a regal dress that humbly glowed with a misty blue, like the sky  when dawn has approached on a clear day. She had no jewels save a  pearl headband that kept her hair from flapping, and her feet were  bare. The elder was striking in her mature beauty and commanded great  respect and love with the smallest gestures as she greeted her  guests. Her hair was much longer than her daughter’s, and it was  flecked with dim silver and tied up to expose her silky neck, but age  had clearly been kind to her and she wore her years proudly, although  her ruby eyes did not even hold half the life they once did. They  were Alto and Cirrus, former Queen and Princess of the Cloud Kingdom,  and Sharyn knew them well, since she had helped save them from a  dreadful curse. The third was a woman with brilliantly colorful  wings— not like Rebecca’s pair at all, but naturally attached at  birth, as much a part of her body as her eyes and ears. She had  feathers for hair, cautious eyes and a sharp face, and when she  recognized her fellow passengers, she yelled in anger.</p>
<p>“Oh, shit! You’re those meddling bitches from  before!!”</p>
<p>“And you’re that foul harpy that soured our journey  so much,” Sharyn growled. She pulled her sword but could not swing  it; Amy came between them and hugged the bird-woman.</p>
<p>“Ferrara! It’s so great to see you again! How have  you been?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Uh, hey! If it isn’t Amy Miracle! It’s  great seeing you! I figured you’d still be traveling with these  hoodlums!”</p>
<p>“How dare you insinuate that <em>we</em> are the  villains here!”</p>
<p>“Amy, what the hell are you doing?” Lyara growled.  Amy turned to face her friends, still clinging to Ferrara. Her sweet  emerald eyes glittered with deep patience.</p>
<p>“I’m greeting a dear friend, of course! Ferr helped  me out while I was stuck on that primitive world. We grew close and I  found out what a good person she is.”</p>
<p>“A good person?!” Lyara screeched. “Do I need to  remind you of all the trouble she’s caused us?!”</p>
<p>“Um, pardon me,” Alto said tenderly, “but what is  all this about? You must be mistaken! Ferrara’s the sweetest,  kindest, most wonderful person. She might be a little coarse at  times, but that’s no reason to be so judgmental.”</p>
<p>“Highness, thou hast not the inclination to her  treachery,” Sharyn hissed.</p>
<p>“You’re the ones that don’t have a clue!”  Cirrus exclaimed, holding Ferrara close. “Ferr came and saved us  when we were on the brink of starvation, without any concern for her  own welfare. She took care of us and watched over us until we were  fit to go on…and when we did, she came with us, because I had  fallen in love with her, and I wanted to be with her.” At the  mention that they were lovers, iron-willed princess and foul-mouthed  brigand-bird, everyone gawked. Alto smiled proudly; Ferrara laughed.</p>
<p>“Uh, well, you know how these things go!” she  explained sheepishly to Amy. “It’s pretty hard to refuse a  princess!”</p>
<p>“So you two are together now?” Amy said. She smiled  sweetly and clasped their hands. “I’m so happy! I just knew there  was somebody out there who’d see you for what you really were.”</p>
<p>“Excuse us,” Lyara snorted. “But all that aside,  your highness, weren’t you with the Dead Roses?”</p>
<p>“Yes, all too briefly,” she replied wistfully.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? They didn’t get rid of you, did  they? Rose didn’t strike me as the type.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, gracious no. She actually made me her new  first mate…and her lover.” Alto blushed warmly, a crestfallen  smile on her lips as she recalled happier times. Tears formed in her  eyes as she resumed her tale. “But all that ended shortly after the  Space Race. You all were there, right? I’m assuming from your  earlier question that you haven’t heard the news.”</p>
<p>“What might that be, majesty?” Sharyn asked. Alto  took a steadying breath before answering.</p>
<p>“Captain Rose is…she’s dead. She was murdered by  an assassin after the race.”</p>
<p>“That’s awful!” Amy exclaimed. “What about her  crew? Couldn’t they do anything?”</p>
<p>“The crew was almost entirely wiped out with her, and  the ship was launched into Hagan’s star. The only survivors are  people like us, who weren’t onboard when the killer attacked. I’d  say that at best, there are probably only a dozen of us left. That’s  how Cirrus and I came to be impoverished so suddenly.”</p>
<p>“What a horrible fate!” Sharyn exclaimed. “The  Rose that hath lived up to her name was a stern, strong, worthy  adversary; tis’ shameful to hear of her demise. But who was the  assassin?”</p>
<p>“We had the opportunity to meet him several days  later,” Cirrus shuddered, holding both mother and lover close. “He  called himself Barbarossa, Captain of <em>The Flying Dutchman</em>. We  wanted to avenge our friends, but…we couldn’t. He decided to let  the rest of us go: he said, ‘I have already finished my work. It  would be a meaningless waste to kill the rest of you. Go and live  with what you have left.’”</p>
<p>“Did he really call himself the Captain of <em>The  Flying Dutchman</em>?” Amy whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes, why? Does that mean anything?” She didn’t  answer them immediately. When the trolley came to its destination,  Cirrus and Alto offered to treat everyone to dinner, and even though  Lyara and Sharyn were still wary of Ferrara, they trusted Amy’s  judgment and went along. They wanted to learn more about Rose, and  her killer, and what happened when they left the Hagan system.</p>
<p>“I hope you’re prepared for a long story,” Alto  warned them.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Fuuka Fujiwara stepped outside for a moonlit stroll  once dinner with the Suings had ended. Shana’s family had returned  in the middle, throwing a fairly utopian setting into chaos, and had  surprised her with their deplorable ways; it was amazing that three  pure souls had crawled out of that cesspool. Apparently, you really  couldn’t judge a person based on just one factor, not even if you  wanted to judge them positively. But she had other thoughts on her  mind as well— for one, Allen Suing’s condition. It struck Fuuka  as cruel that she and he both had the exact same ailment, and that  Shana and Athena would suffer the same long, agonizing years of  futile care and waiting. If only she could remove this deadly  disease, or at least ease the agony it would cause! But that was  impossible; it would be better if they both enjoyed what time they  had left. Allen had so many beautiful worlds to look forward to, and  Fuuka…</p>
<p>“It’s not fair,” she whispered to the stars as  she began to cry. “I wanted to live so many years with you, Athena.  I wanted to adopt children and raise a family. I wanted us to grow  old together and die peacefully. I want to believe that there’s a  godly force out there watching over us, but how can they be so  heartless? Where has all the goodness gone in the universe?”</p>
<p>“Do you really wish never to die?” she heard a  voice call out to her. Fuuka jumped in surprise and stepped back.  With her sharp senses, she recognized her visitor immediately, and  bowed politely as she welcomed the New Angel of Death.</p>
<p>“We meet again. Have you come for Allen…or for me?”</p>
<p>“No,” she answered, stepping into the light. Grave  had gotten rid of her black cloak in exchange for normal clothes: she  wore jeans and a pale blue long-sleeved shirt just like normal  people. Even her scythe was gone; she just carried an ancient  hourglass. “I had an appointment elsewhere on this world. However,  when I heard you talking, I couldn’t help but get involved. Forgive  me.”</p>
<p>“No forgiveness needed,” Fuuka replied softly. “You  work on a different level than we do.”</p>
<p>“I’m not immortal,” Grave said, smiling gently.  “This body is as fragile and ephemeral as yours. I just had an  enormous task thrust upon me. But back to my earlier question.”  Fuuka shook her head firmly. She knew better than to wish for  everlasting life. She had seen enough anime— particularly the works  of Osamu Tezuka— to know that those who wished for eternal life  always regretted their decision.</p>
<p>“I know better than that,” she whispered. “I  wouldn’t want to keep on living if everything I had ever loved was  taken away. I just don’t think it’s fair that I have to die like  that.”</p>
<p>“You’re not the only one who thinks that way,”  Grave warned her. “As a doctor, you’ve seen plenty of examples of  people my forerunner and I took ‘before their time’. But as you  said, you and I work on different levels; I only take those my  Masters have designated, and I rarely question their decision. Some  of those people deserve to die, while others have earned the right to  transcend suffering. You must understand, Dr. Fujiwara: a fair world  would not be very good to live in. You would not like it at all.  Mortals must be grateful for the mercy and grace of the higher  powers; we shouldn’t complain. I am sorry that I will have to take  you away sooner than you’d like. Believe me, I despise this job…but  somebody has to do it.”</p>
<p>“What about your predecessor?” Fuuka whispered  bitterly. Grave sighed forlornly.</p>
<p>“If I began that story, I would have to take you  before it ended.”</p>
<p>“Is my time really that short?” she cried  fearfully. Grave shrugged.</p>
<p>“All time is short to me.” Fuuka heard Shana and  Allen laughing in the distance, and turned to look at them When she  turned around again, her guest was gone, swift and silent as the  evening breeze. She shivered a little and went back inside.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Since Shana was staying longer than she had originally  intended, she asked to use her old room, which was little more than a  space she shared with a few of her sisters. She had happily been  spared most of their attention during her lifetime, and she had no  reason to worry about rooming with them— but even so, they  declined, saying they had other places to be, which could only mean  trouble in their case. This worked out just fine for Shana, because  now there were two spare beds, one for each of her guests. Fuuka  turned in for the night without a word, but given the circumstances,  her silence was perfectly understandable. Herut got a bed to herself,  but she couldn’t imagine sleeping alone, so she snuck out and  snuggled next to Shana, who took her in her arms very willingly.</p>
<p>“I was actually going to creep into your bed,” she  giggled, caressing Herut’s face. In the sickly light of the  outside, they both looked far older and more mature than they really  were. “I want to thank you for coming with me…and for a lot of  other things.”</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it,” Herut blushed. “I was happy  to come along. I actually came here for selfish reasons, but I’m  glad I got my priorities straight.”</p>
<p>“And what does that mean?”</p>
<p>“I’ve just been questioning my humanity. I mean, I  am sort of an android when you think about it.”</p>
<p>“No you’re not,” Shana beamed, snuggling closer  until their noses touched. She took Herut’s hands and held them to  her chest. “I don’t know what you were like before you were an  M&amp;R unit, but does that really matter? What are you right now?  Who are you right now? You’re my best friend, my rock, and my most  precious companion, and I love you deeply. I would not love a  machine. I mean, I’m not Eve.” Herut giggled warmly.</p>
<p>“But Eve’s turned over a new leaf as well. She’s  got a sparkle in her eyes that wasn’t there a few weeks ago.  Anyway, I don’t think I have any more questions. I used to hate  Chandra because she was so frivolous with her emotions, but I also  envied that side of her a little. I wanted to get in touch with that  side of myself, even if it meant giving something up. I know it  sounds trite, but meeting you really brought all that out. I’m not  so scared or angry anymore. Of course, that probably has to do with  the fact that I’m only in love with one person.”</p>
<p>Shana just smiled at her; she didn’t have to ask who  that was. They kissed each other silently, lovingly, and made hushed  promises to one another as they exchanged hearts. Night brought a  sweet relief that had not been a part of their lives for as long as  they could remember.</p>
