<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>As the Dorm Heads and the Head Mistress moved down to the lobby Kima, 
now preferring to be called Kimberly, sat up in bed, clenching at her 
chest and gasping as she tried to catch her breath. It felt as if 
someone had punched her in the chest, forcing every last bit of air from 
her lungs and now each breath came in quivered spurts. Air finally 
filled her lungs as she took several deep breaths, causing a dizziness 
to overcome her and she lay back in the bed once again. Her mind was a 
flutter of memories and images from the day&#39;s events and dreams. She 
clenched at the sides of her head as a thousand thoughts threatened to 
crack open her skull and leak out upon pillow behind her head. She 
pulled off the blankets, with the intent to search for some painkillers, 
when she discovered a small, frail, nude girl with sandy brown, sweat 
matted, hair, curled up beside her. Her mind raced as it tried to recall 
how this girl ended up in bed with her. She reached out to touch the 
girl when another flood of memories invaded her mind. A foster home, 
several young girls, a dark room, camera and... Her lips quivered and 
she was over come by a queasy feeling that rose up from her stomach and 
made her lips suddenly felt numb and a heat rose up around her neck and 
behind her ears. Quickly she got out of the bed and rushed to the small 
bathroom that adjoined the bedroom. Without hesitation she stuck her 
head in the toilet bowl and processed to vomit. 

A sicken sweet smell filled her mind and she could taste it upon her 
puke covered lips. She wiped at her mouth and smelt a linger scent of 
something familiar upon her finger tips, a scent that made her stomach 
turn once again and she crouched over the toilet yet again, awaiting the 
inevitable foul liquid to come pouring forth yet again. When only a dry 
cough emitted she sunk to the floor with her back to the glass doors of 
the shower. Her eyes wondered her surroundings as she tried to piece 
together where she was or how she got there. The last she recalled was 
being in Ma&#39;am&#39;s old foster home, cleaning the floors as she had been 
told, cleaning with her friends and sisters. She had no recollection of 
how she got from the foster home to this new place and this frightened 
her greatly. She scanned the room to find herself in the tiniest 
washroom she had ever seen. A single sink and a standing shower to 
either side of the toilet, taking up most of the space in the room, 
giving only a small square metre or more of moving space. A frost shaded 
bulb softly shed its light upon the rooms white walls and tile floor, a 
floor that was covered in a clutter of clothes that laid in crumpled 
piles in the corner near the door, a pair of pyjamas, a night gown and 
two pair of panties. She recognized the blue colour of the pyjamas and 
tiny paw prints that covered then within an instant. A friend has lent 
her those to wear, but what friends and why did they lend them to her? 

Her eyes moved to one of the pairs of panties lying near the edge of the 
shower and she picked them up, inhaling its scent. It was the same smell 
from her memories, so sweet and so wonderful. She rubbed at her eyes as 
tears began to well up in the corners. What had become of her and how 
did she end up in this room with this strange girl? More over, how did 
she come to long for this scent? More memories and image filled her 
mind, images of her making love in the shower to the girl who now slept 
soundly in the other room. A girl that she now remember went by the name 
of Penny, a girl whom she had met in the foster home, where they had 
become very close. More then just foster sisters or just mere friends 
even, and this was not the first time they had made love to one another. 
There had been other times, but she would not have called it &#39;making 
love&#39; those times, no those were nightmares and the images of being 
pressured to have sex with the girl flashed through her mind like the 
camera she was forced to strip before. With each flash of imagery she 
wrapped her arms around her head ever so tighter, hammering her head 
against the metal frame of the shower stall with increasing voracity in 
an attempt to ward off the horrifying memories.

&quot;Kim?&quot; A small weak voice drifted in from the bedroom, causing Kim to 
stop moving and search for a place to hide, she noticed she was still 
holding the underwear and shoved it behind her back as Penny stepped 
into the light of the washroom and stared down at the girl before her, 
&quot;Are you alright?&quot; She inquired worriedly, taking a ginger step through 
the threshold of the washroom. 

&quot;I... I...&quot; Kim shook her head vigorously while clenching the sides of 
her head, trying to keep the tidal wave of emotions that crashed over 
her. She did not want Penny to see her this way and yet the closer the 
girl approached the louder the echoing voices in her head screamed at 
her to flee, but she held steady, cowering between the toilet and the 
shower stall. 

Penny slowly lowered herself next to Kim and reached out towards her 
only to have the girl flinch back, hitting her head against the toilet&#39;s 
tank and let out a scream of pain. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorrryyyy...&quot; Kimberly wept, holding her head, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m 
sorry.&quot; 

Penny gently set her hand upon the trembling girl&#39;s head, trying to coax 
her out from the corner and into her arms when Kim flinched in pain. 
Penny recoiled, &quot;Kim, Kim it is just me.&quot; She assured the girl, and then 
glanced at her hand to see spots of blood upon her fingertips. Her eyes 
moved to Kim again as worry built up inside of her, &quot;Kim! You&#39;re hurt!&quot; 

Kim reached up to touch the back of her head and quickly pulled away. 
She stared down at the blood that now coated her fingers and panicked, 
&quot;No... no...&quot; She slowly shook her head in disbelieve of what she was 
seeing. 

Not able to take being in the room any longer she quickly pushed passed 
Penny and gathered the pyjama bottoms off the ground, &quot;I... I have to 
go...&quot; She stated nervously as she pulled on the pants. 

&quot;Go? Go where?&quot; Penny stood as she watched the girl in confusion, &quot;I 
thought you were going to move in with me?&quot; 

Those words caused Kim to falter as she tried to get her second foot 
into the pant leg. Penny rushed to Kim&#39;s side, giving her balance and 
leading her over to the sink so she could hold onto something. For a 
moment the two girls stared into each other&#39;s eyes, Kim pushed up 
against the sink with Penny&#39;s arms around her. 

&quot;Please don&#39;t leave me.&quot; Penny pleaded, misery filling her tired green 
eyes, &quot;I need you.&quot; 

Kim felt unable to pull away from those eyes, eyes that she clearly 
remembered now that she got a moment to look into them. She recalled 
those very eyes watching her through the night and how they silently 
offered themselves to Kim. Kim wrapped her arms around the girl and held 
her tight, &quot;I... I&#39;m not leaving you.&quot; She stated, taking a deep breath 
as she tried to regain her thoughts. Something about holding the girl 
felt right to her, but at that same time there was the well of 
confusion, &quot;I just need some time... to sort out my thoughts is all.&quot; 
She rubbed at her forehead as another headache rose up from within, &quot;And 
I need some Advil, or something, I have an awful headache.&quot; 

Penny stepped back from the girl and glanced around in search of 
something, &quot;I&#39;ll come with you.&quot; She offered hopefully as she picked up 
the panties that Kim had only recently been sitting on and began to slip 
them on. 

Kim reached out and took the girl&#39;s cheek in her hand while shaking her 
head; &quot;I need to be alone for a moment.&quot; She said unhappily, &quot;I just 
need to get some air, alright?&quot; 

A crushed expression crossed Penny&#39;s face for a brief moment, which was 
quickly replaced by a fake smile, &quot;All.. Alright... I... I&#39;ll move my 
things around to make room for yours, okay?&quot; 

Kim forced herself not to flinch this time. Part of her did want to stay 
with the girl, but she did not wish to commit until she was sure where 
her mind set laid, however she could not refuse the pleading look in 
those eyes and let out a sigh of defeat, &quot;Alright. You do that and I&#39;ll 
be back in a bit.&quot; 

Penny smiled brightly as she rushed out of the tiny washroom and flung 
open the curtains, spiriting the shadows into the corners of the room. 
The room itself was rather large for one girl. It was square with the 
washroom in the corner and the bed up against one of the two sets of 
long windows that ran across the northwest and north eastern walls, Kim 
figured the building must have laid on an angel for she could see the 
sun drifting behind a large set of clouds in the distance. 

Finding her pyjama top laying near the washroom doorway she picked it 
up, and pulled it on, as she watched the small girl run around the room, 
gathering her own clothes and getting dressed. Kim felt sorry for the 
girl and wished that her mind would sort itself out quickly so she could 
get back to the girl as soon as possible. While buttoning up her shirt 
she moved around the room towards the bedroom door and out into a hall. 

&quot;Come back soon.&quot; Penny&#39;s pleas floated to Kim&#39;s turned back. 

Without turning around Kim nodded, not able to face the girl again, and 
stepped out of the room, closing the door behind herself and leaning 
against it. She thought she could hear the small sound of a chocked sob 
through the thick wood of the door and tried to force herself to ignore 
it, she was in no condition to be there for the girl at that moment and 
she knew it. She pushes off the door and glanced around herself, trying 
to regain her bearings but finding herself lost and confused. She did 
not recall being in an apartment building before; in fact she could 
barely remember what happened to herself and Penny after the foster 
home. She stood at the corner of two halls, one stretching out in front 
of her and another to her left. Halls covered in an old polished wood 
that darkened the area eve with the lighting, which was provided by the 
lamps that lines the walls. Down the hall, in front of her, she could 
see the light of the sun shining off the wood panelling and decided that 
would be the best direction to investigate first and started down the 
hall.
