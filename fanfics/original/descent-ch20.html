<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/descent-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>The Lady Diana reclined on the couch, the lovely
blonde studying the figure who was kneeling before
her. &quot;So, our pet killers are ready?&quot; she asked,
reaching up to stroke the brand on her cheek almost
absentmindedly.

&quot;Yes, m&#39;lady,&quot; Grace moaned softly, shivering at the
touch of a hand on her clothes covered breast. Sitting
at the end of the couch one of the Lady&#39;s many slaves
was nearly wrapped around her body, kissing the back
of her neck as her hands roamed freely.

Diana looked amused as she saw her black haired
lieutenant being ravaged by the gorgeous young girl,
sipping from a glass of red wine as she watched it.
&quot;What do you expect them to do?&quot; she asked calmly,
pleased at her servant&#39;s work.

&quot;None of them are known for their impulse control,&quot;
Grace croaked, her throat tight with desire. Clearing
it she continued, &quot;I suspect that they&#39;ll simply go
out and begin killing... that will draw both Descent
and the Sister out.&quot; She bit back a moan as her full
breasts were squeezed, skilled fingers unerringly
seeking out her nipples.

Taking another slow sip Diana set the glass on a tray
help by a leather bound slave girl, the older woman
gorgeous in her tight bondage. &quot;We&#39;ll have the police
officers we own stay clear,&quot; she mused, &quot;any
do-gooders that remain in the force can be cannon
fodder for our pets.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll need,&quot; Grace bit back a moan as her nipple was
tugged and pinched, &quot;containment on several levels.
I&#39;d suggest a death cult cover story...&quot;

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Diana said after a moment of reflection,
&quot;and a mournful statement from the mayor&#39;s office,
regretting the incident and saluting the brave, fallen
police officers.&quot;

&quot;Mmmmmph,&quot; the leather clad figure nodded the very
little that her bondage costume would allow, the
corset and gloves tying her arms back, pinching her
body, straps making her flesh bulge. A long leather
skirt brutally hugged her legs together making walking
incredibly difficult and regular steps impossible.

&quot;Yes, Madame Mayor?&quot; Diana said mockingly, reaching up
to grasp the wadded up panties that had been stuffed
into her mouth and pulling them free with a wet pop.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the mayor breathed out weakly, &quot;I&#39;ll do
whatever you say madam.&quot;

&quot;Of course you will,&quot; Diana looked amused as she ran a
hand up the mayors thigh, &quot;and maybe if you&#39;re very
good, I&#39;ll give you to Selene for a night.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; the mayor blushed, looking more than
a little humiliated by her treatment. Of course that
was part of what got her off, the helplessness and
control being exorcised on her, the embarrassment of
her situation. Part of her knew she should break
free... but an even larger part was drawn to this
life.

Grace bit back a gasp as a sleep hand slid beneath her
shirt, caressing her bare belly then sliding up to
stroke across her bra covered breasts. &quot;There are,&quot;
she looked up at Diana a bit dazedly, &quot;certain
administrative matters I have to deal with... may I
go?&quot;

Diana watched a few moments as the slave slowly worked
on eroding her lovely lieutenant&#39;s composure. &quot;You
hate losing control, don&#39;t you?&quot; she purred as she ran
a hand up the mayor&#39;s ass. &quot;One of these days I must
have sweet Rachel bring you to orgasm in front of me,&quot;
but she added regretfully, &quot;though not today. You may
go.&quot;

With a sigh of relief Grace pulled free from her
lover, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

As Grace was leaving she heard the mayor ask in a soft
whisper, &quot;Why mistress... why did you do that to my
daughter?&quot;

&quot;Why did I make her into one of my slaves?&quot; Diana
responded. She sounded amused, &quot;To show you I can, of
course. To make you understand that I own you, the
spawn of your loins and anything else I want.&quot;

Grace fought down a shudder as the door closed,
straightening out her clothes as she strode down the
hall of the mansion. It was in moments like this she
was most tempted to try to strike out at the lady, to
kill the puppet master, but she held herself back. No
matter how vulnerable Diana might seen Grace knew
there were defenses ready to act, to kill any
attempted assassin.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Lina nodded from where she waited at the end
of the hall, the younger redhead&#39;s expression kept
perfectly blank.

Grace strongly suspected that Lina knew what had just
happened in Diana&#39;s chambers, and her fists itched to
wipe that look off her face... &quot;Do we have someone
stationed at the Daughters?&quot; she asked, getting down
to business.

&quot;One of the regulars, Jasmine, has agreed to let us
know if any of our Hunters make a move on the club,&quot;
Lina said promptly, falling into step beside Grace as
they walked to the stairs and down into the main
entrance way.

&quot;I&#39;m surprised,&quot; Grace said after taking a moment to
match the name up to a face, &quot;I thought she was loyal
to the club and that police officer she&#39;s dating.&quot;
From what she remembered the beautiful escort worked
out of the apartments behind the Daughters, the nearly
human woman providing exotic dates for a price.

&quot;I suspect she&#39;s doing it out of that loyalty to the
club,&quot; Lina said as she nodded to one of the guards at
the door, the two leaving into the afternoon sunlight,
&quot;she knows we&#39;ll stop the assassins if they do try to
hit the club.&quot;

Grace walked over to the red sports car, climbing into
the passengers seat as Lina took the wheel. &quot;Of course
it also gives us leverage over her,&quot; Grace purred.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Lina said with satisfaction as she took the
wheel, turning the key and starting it up. &quot;Where to
first?&quot; she asked respectfully.

&quot;Drive,&quot; Grace said as she pulled her cellphone out.
The car smoothly left the circular drive and into the
green hills around the city as she dialed, &quot;Selene,
it&#39;s Grace. Are the new batch of slaves ready to ship
out?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Selene purred and Grace could easily
imagine the satisfied look on the lush redhead&#39;s face.
A sorceress and seductress Selene was very good at
what she did, not to mention taking great pleasure in
her work. &quot;I&#39;ve put the binding enchantments in place,
as well as... broken them in just a bit,&quot; she
finished.

&quot;Make sure the ones who were virgin stay virginal,&quot;
Grace put some iron in her voice, &quot;the Lady would be
very displeased if her customers were
disappointed....&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I was careful,&quot; Selene hastened to say
just a bit fearfully. &quot;They&#39;re ready to be shipped out
tonight,&quot; she added.

&quot;Good,&quot; Grace nodded, &quot;Descent and her friends should
be busy with the hunters, but take the usual
precautions.&quot; Hanging up she noticed they were at the
edge of the city, the houses stretching out in
organized grids.

&quot;We&#39;ve made good time,&quot; Lina explained, &quot;do we head
for the office or...?&quot;

Grace hesitated, looking out the window. The merciless
teasing of the girl still pulsed in her blood, her
desire humming like a cord in her. She wanted, needed,
some relief no matter what she might want to think,
and soon. Reluctantly she said, &quot;We&#39;ll need to stop in
one of the houses first... then head to the office.&quot;

There was a little flash of surprise on Lina&#39;s pretty
face, but she mastered it after only a second or so.
&quot;Of course, ma&#39;am,&quot; she said, taking a turn by pure
instinct. &quot;Is there one you&#39;d prefer?&quot; she asked
respectfully.

&quot;Patricia knows me pretty well,&quot; Grace answered her
with just a trace of reluctance, &quot;it&#39;d be best, I
think.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Lina nodded taking a route that she knew from
being a bagman for the organization not that long ago.

Grace gave Lina a look, wondering what was going on
behind those oddly calm eyes. &quot;You don&#39;t seem too
surprised,&quot; she noted.

Lina looked forward, keeping her eyes focused on the
road ahead. &quot;There have been some rumors,&quot; she
conceded after a moment.

&quot;I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; Grace said, feeling a flash of
irritation.

Lina looked at her sideways a moment, then hesitantly
said, &quot;Ma&#39;am.... if you wish, I could take care of
that for you myself.&quot;

Grace actually raised her eyebrow in surprise. &quot;Do you
really know what you&#39;re getting into?&quot; she asked,
studying Lina with interest.

Lina&#39;s voice was faintly husky as she said, &quot;I think
so, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Grace smiled slightly, quickly making up her mind.
&quot;Pull over,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;and call the office...
I think we&#39;ll be a while.&quot;</pre>
