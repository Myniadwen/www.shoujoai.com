It was a horrible site to see the state that Summer&#146;s house was left in 
the night after her birthday party. Such a mess was the mark of a good 
time, but was also going to be an utter  nightmare to clean up. Cans and 
bottles that once contained alcohol were strewn over the tables, chairs 
and stands. Much had been moved around. At least three of the beds 
upstairs had been unmade. And you didn&#146;t have to be a genius to know 
why. In the hallways, the scent of smoke still lingered. Pillows that 
were supposed to be on the three couches  of the living room were 
scattered around the floor along with dozens of bottle caps. The air 
still felt thick there; as if the party were still on, as if the music 
was still banging. Fortunately for the three people left in that house, 
the party ended over five hours ago. 

Beams of light shone through the large windows of the living room that 
overlooked the lawn of Summer&#146;s house. It was morning. Well, a little 
later than morning. Holly-Raine released a groggy sigh as those beams 
hit her face. And her eyes fluttered open with the realization that she 
was awake. The brunette was strung out over the couch to the left of 
Summer&#146;s rather large living room, while Jenny was doing the same on the 
couch facing opposite, her hand held at her head. 

Holly looked over at her friend, rubbing her eyes a little. &quot;Huh? Did... 
you say something?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m never drinking like that again,&quot; Jenny declared, &quot;It feels like 
someone&#146;s drilling in my skull... ugh...&quot;

Yeah, Holly could relate to that. &quot;Last night was awesome though, wasn&#146;t 
it? I&#146;m glad that Summer enjoyed herself. By the way, where is she?&quot;

&quot;In her kitchen,&quot; Jenny replied slowly, &quot;Making breakfast for us. I know 
she means well, but I really don&#146;t feel like eating anything right about 
now.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#146;ll go see her.&quot;

Holly-Raine lifted her head upwards as best she could. It had escaped 
her that she wasn&#146;t doing any better than Jenny was. Still, they were 
teens and this was a party. These were the times in life where you got 
to enjoy yourself the most. It was because of this that Holly didn&#146;t 
mind waking up with the odd hangover now and again. The young woman 
yawned with &#145;unladylike&#146; casualness, and proceeded to tidy herself up, 
standing upright from the sofa. She smoothed out her skirt a bit, 
straightened her chestnut hair by running her fingers through them, then 
walked out the room. Holly passed through the hallway until she reached 
the kitchen door, then entered. 

The nubile young brunette smiled as she saw Summer across from her, her 
hand wrapped around the handle of a frying pan, while a quartet of eggs 
sizzled on it. Summer looked back from the stove as she heard someone 
enter the kitchen. The (former) birthday girl gave a generous and warm 
smile to Holly, knowing that she and Jenny were finally starting to wake 
up. 

&quot;Morning, sunshine,&quot; Summer chirped. &quot;How&#146;d you sleep?&quot;

Holly shook her head. &quot;Not good. Remind me to bring some Pepto-Bismol 
the next time I come to one of your parties.&quot;

Summer giggled deviously. &quot;Sorry, but we&#146;re out. I&#146;ll try to keep that 
in mind in future. But hey, I&#146;ve always said that the best way to get 
over the post-drink morning is to line your stomach with something 
strong. So grab a plate. I don&#146;t fry like this very often.&quot;

Though Holly didn&#146;t quite see it that way, the girl did as she was told. 
Holly went to one of the cupboards that surrounded the kitchen wall, 
withdrew a plate (by now she knew her way around Summer&#146;s house) and 
went over to the counter right by Summer. A few slices of toast had 
already been made at this point. Holly snagged one as she waited beside 
Summer, nibbling on it carefully.

&quot;Hey Summer?&quot; 

Summer didn&#146;t look up from the sizzling frying pan. &quot;Yup?&quot;

&quot;I meant what I said last night,&quot; Holly replied between bites, &quot;I&#146;m glad 
that what happened between us won&#146;t get in the way of us being friends. 
I wouldn&#146;t want it to.&quot;

&quot;I understand, Holly,&quot; The taller girl affirmed, &quot;I don&#146;t want things to 
be weird between us either. So you shouldn&#146;t worry about it. We&#146;ve been 
friends since we were kids. Me, you and Jenny. Nobody or nothing is 
gonna get in the way of that. Okay?&quot;

Holly nodded happily. &quot;Yeah.&quot;

For which, Summer was thankful. &quot;Good. Now could you go get Jenny for 
me? She&#146;s gonna eat some of this if I have to jam it down her throat and 
force her to munch with my hands.&quot;

**********

&quot;...Charlemagne&#146;s quest for power. Summarize three key objectives...&quot;

Cassie tapped her HB pencil on the edge of her bedroom desk quietly. 
History homework. It was a personal habit of hers to clean up any 
unfinished homework on a Sunday morning.  And since she had been out 
partying with Alyshia last night, she had a lot to catch up on. But for 
the most part, Cassie was glad that she had gotten out last night. 
Though she had made absolutely no headway with Holly-Raine yet... not 
even so much as telling the girl how she felt, and Shannon absolutely 
humiliating her... Cassie felt strangely relaxed and loose at this 
point. She knew that it was no result of her own making. It has 
something to do with Alyshia.

Cassie stared over at her bed. It was freshly made, since Cassie had 
fallen asleep on the couch last night, much to her Dad&#146;s displeasure. 
But on that bed were her clothes last night. And on top of those clothes 
was a piece of paper. Cassie knew from memory that Alyshia&#146;s phone 
number was written down on that little paper sheet. It surprised Cassie 
greatly to have hit it off so well with Alyshia. Though she couldn&#146;t 
quite understand why that girl would want to have anything to do with 
her. Cassie didn&#146;t have that many friends, not real ones anyway, and up 
came this eager, confident girl, who for some reason, really liked her. 
And Cassie liked her too.

To be honest, Cassie really did need this pick-me-up. After what Shannon 
did to her at Summer&#146;s party, she was bound to experience waves of abuse 
and teasing from that bitch&#146;s pack when she went to school tomorrow 
morning. The fact that she had managed to enjoy the remainder of the 
party with Alyshia made that idea easier to deal with. But that was 
something she would worry about tomorrow.  Right now...  she had to 
think about the most pressing issue on her mind. 

And it was, as usual, Holly.

Cassie slid her History books to one side and pulled out her poetry 
diary. The one dedicated to Holly-Raine. It was adorned in love hearts 
and little scriptures of the beautiful girl&#146;s name, signs of passion 
which very much did Cassie&#146;s feelings justice. She pulled back the cover 
and flicked through masses and masses of poems and short stories, until 
she came to a blank sheet of paper. Perfect for writing. And as this 
happened, Cassie thought back in her mind about what she had seen of 
Holly last night. In her mind&#146;s eye she could so clearly picture that 
stunning girl as she strode down that dark night street. Dressed so 
sexily... walking so seductively... looking so heavenly. Soon as those 
images came to mind, Cassie was already putting pencil to paper and 
jotting down her feelings. Her passion. It was the best way for her to 
vent those urges. 

Yet, even though writing another poetic passage did much to cool 
Cassie&#146;s yearning, she knew the obvious. Nothing was going to be 
resolved unless she actually presented her feelings. But after last 
night, Cassie&#146;s resolve was wavering. Not only had Shannon totally 
embarrassed her, but Holly-Raine virtually ignored her. Plus, she had 
made a new friend out of Alyshia. Telling Holly how she felt would upset 
all of that. If Holly rejected her, then bang, Cassie&#146;s life was over. 
If word leaked out about Cassie&#146;s homosexuality, it would add more fire 
to Shannon&#146;s engine. More ammo to slam Cassie with. Only this time it 
would be a lot more hurtful. And what of Alyshia? Would she want to be 
friends with a girl who had a crush on another girl? 

All those issues were not lost on Cassie. Which made her decision even 
more important. Would she tell Holly-Raine how she felt and risk 
everything? Or keep bottled up with little glimpses of Holly from afar 
when she knew that wasn&#146;t enough for her?

Cassie was stumped. &quot;What should I do...?&quot;

**********

Monday.

Holly-Raine sighed as she made a desperate pitch across the stone 
courtyard that enfolded the main building of Atlantic High. The girl 
dashed past all of the other more casual students that just happened to 
be lazing around, those whose idle nature was brought by their decision 
to skip class. But Holly-Raine couldn&#146;t do with that. She was almost 
fifteen minutes late for Miss Harding&#146;s History class. And Miss Harding 
lived up to her name when it came to tardiness. For such a beautiful 
woman, she could be one hell of a hard-ass. That was what made Holly run 
across the courtyard and rush towards the glass-pane front door of the 
humanities department. Holly yanked the door open and continued her 
desperate run, plying through whatever teacher or student that just 
happened to be in her way. She really couldn&#146;t believe that she had 
ended up waking up so late this morning. Rather than go home on Sunday, 
Holly and Jenny decided to stay at Summer&#146;s for the rest of the weekend. 
Which was a good idea, because it took more than a few hours to clean up 
all the mess and disorder made during Summer&#146;s party.  But by the time 
Monday morning had rolled around, Holly still felt wiped out for some 
reason. So she adopted her time-honoured cure for that sort of thing. A 
bubble bath. In the middle of the morning. Of course, Summer and Jenny 
went straight for school, while Holly-Raine yelled and told them that 
she would catch up before class. Well it didn&#146;t quite work out like 
that. And now she was late for Miss Harding&#146;s class. Holly turned a 
corner and whizzed by another startled teacher as she dashed for Miss 
Harding&#146;s History room. But the moment Holly-Raine turned that corner...

...She would have had no idea that that moment would turn her current 
life on its head as well. The girl only stopped running as she felt her 
body collide with someone else&#146;s. She let out a little &#145;oof&#146; sound 
before landing square on the ground, hiking up her standard black 
mini-skirt. The brunette launched a squeal of embarrassment, knowing 
that she had just given the person standing above her a flash of her 
panties. Of course, Holly-Raine&#146;s concerns switched from embarrassment 
to awe as the girl she slammed into finally spoke. 

&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; She told the floored teen, &quot;Here, let me give you a 
hand there.&quot;

The girl projected her hand at Holly-Raine. Holly was about to make a 
little remark about her own clumsiness, until she actually stopped and 
looked at the girl whom she had bumped into. Holly-Raine&#146;s marvellous 
bright green eyes widened as she took in the sight of the woman standing 
above her. She was... beautiful. And from the instant that their eyes 
connected, Holly started to take little glimpses of this young woman. 
There was something about her... that silky jet black hair, passing down 
to her shoulders and spilling off them in thick tresses. Those pouting 
but somehow mature cheeks, brandishing a rosy shade, which somehow 
melted against the pale ashen tone of her skin. This also contributed to 
highlighting the sweet sky blue of her eyes, ones that held youth but at 
the same time; cunning and intelligence. Her bodily form followed the 
path of beauty that the face had set for it, from the heart-shaped ass 
and the long, smooth legs enswathed by denim, to the radically thin 
waist and small yet firm breasts clinging to her torso in the boundaries 
of that somehow revealing black tank top. Though this girl was not 
dressed in clothing that would be considered seductive, she was working 
a spell on Atlantic High&#146;s trademarked necromancer, Holly-Raine. 

When a few seconds passed, Holly realized that she was just now staring 
at the girl, so quickly grabbed her outstretched hand and pulled herself 
up onto two feet. And upon touching the girl&#146;s hand, Holly-Raine was 
left speechless by the softness of her sweet flesh. Suddenly she started 
feeling so light-headed. Light-headed enough to render her (almost) 
speechless. 

...Who was this girl?

&quot;There you go,&quot; The teen spoke, helping Holly up, &quot;You should slow down 
a little in these corridors. You might hurt yourself or something. So... 
what&#146;s your name? I don&#146;t think we&#146;ve met before, have we?&quot;

Holly couldn&#146;t find the words to say anything. Not even in the least. 
For some reason her focus lay solely on this stranger&#146;s eyes. Goddamn 
her eyes. Those pools of crystal blue. Holly could envision herself 
staring at them for hours. That was until the girl playfully waved a 
hand in front of Holly&#146;s face.

She chuckled between the two of them. &quot;Hello? Anybody home? Not feeling 
dazed, are you? I said what&#146;s your name?&quot;

That, Holly began to understand. &quot;M-Me? My... name is Holly-Raine. 
Holly-Raine Johnson.&quot; 

&quot;Holly-Raine, huh?&quot; The girl took a second of thought, &quot;That&#146;s a pretty 
name. Well, since I asked you your name, it&#146;s only fair that I dish out 
my own, right? The name&#146;s Sharon Daniels. Just for the record.  Well, 
I&#146;m late for class, and I guess you are too, so we better cut this 
short. But it was nice meeting you, Holly-Raine.&quot;

After leaving behind a somehow knowing smile, Sharon hiked the small 
pack on her shoulder back into a tighter position, slinging it into 
place. She strode forwards, passing a stunned Holly by, not trading 
another look back. Holly finally regained her senses just enough to look 
over her shoulder. That gorgeous young woman, who seemed to be about a 
year older than Holly herself, turned the corner of the corridor and 
walked off to whatever classes she had in her year. And Holly-Raine was 
left standing there, her senses still ringing from her meeting with 
Sharon Daniels. And now Holly was only sure of one thing. She had to 
become a part of that girl&#146;s life. 

But before she got ahead of herself, there was still the matter of 
History class. Holly had kinda forgotten about it. After all, from 
meeting someone like Sharon, who could blame her? The auburn-haired 
Holly took a few moments to get her head together and then continued her 
journey to Miss Harding&#146;s room, this time walking slowly. Once she came 
to the door, the girl gave an embarrassed and mild smile as she peered 
into the classroom. All students there, including Jenny and Summer, cast 
a look over at the sheepish Holly. And Miss Harding gave her a glance 
too. But hers seemed far more forgiving this time around. 

Holly ran a hand through the back of her hair. &quot;S-Sorry I&#146;m late, Miss 
Harding.&quot;

&quot;Forget it, Holly,&quot; Miss Harding spoke, adjusting her glasses, &quot;You&#146;ve 
been improving your tardiness in the past five months so one slip-up can 
be swept under the rug. Just take a seat and try not to disturb the rest 
of the class.&quot;

Holly nodded to her. &quot;Yes miss.&quot;

But as she began walking over to her desk, Miss Harding said something 
else. &quot;Oh, Holly?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...?&quot;

&quot;Did...&quot; Miss Harding&#146;s voice happened to become a bit more emotional, 
&quot;...You happen to see Miss Blake on your way to class?&quot;

Holly-Raine shook her head. &quot;...No, miss.&quot;

It was safe to say that no one was imagining the brief look of confusion 
that passed over Miss Harding&#146;s face from hearing that. But no one said 
anything regarding it. &quot;...Fine then. Take a seat, Holly.&quot;

**********

Lateness seemed to be a Monday morning trend in Victoria. Because Sharon 
and Holly-Raine were not the only ones to be late for their classes. 
With a science book slung under her arm and a nervous quiver in her 
throat, Cassie stood before the door to her Chemistry class. She was 
late this morning because she had to help out her Dad with a few things 
before he left for work. Normally he wouldn&#146;t have asked because he knew 
how important school was to Cassie, but she was his life-line when it 
came to the books. But that wasn&#146;t really important to Cassie at this 
moment in time. What happened to be of interest to her now was getting 
inside that Chemistry class without making a scene. Classes had already 
started, and Cassie knew that Atlantic High&#146;s bitchiest trendy, Miss 
Shannon Marson, would be in there. And Cassie could barely take the idea 
of coming face-to-face with her again. Shannon had effectively 
humiliated her in front of God-knows-how-many people at Summer&#146;s party. 
Could she really go in there and face that woman after what she did? 
Cassie couldn&#146;t imagine herself plucking up the courage to do something 
like that. Not at all. Normally she would be the first in and just find 
a small seat for herself which put her a hell of a way away from 
Shannon. Now she couldn&#146;t do that... and Cassie felt fear sneak up 
inside her from having to deal with another round of Shannon&#146;s digs. But 
what choices did she have? Cassie couldn&#146;t cut class, she was not that 
kind of person. The girl swallowed the lump of anxiety in her throat and 
pressed her hand against the door. She had to go in. Even if that meant 
facing Shannon. The wood and glass door began to creak open, until 
Cassie heard a voice call out to her. 

&quot;Hey, Cassie!&quot;

Cassie stopped and turned around. She knew that voice. And by golly, the 
voice fit the face. It was Alyshia. The blonde girl eagerly jogged down 
the corridor of the Sciences department, stopping only to catch her 
breath as she came towards the pensive Cassie. Alyshia pressed her palms 
into her knees and caught her breath as intended, then looked up at 
Cassie through those thick bangs of hers. 

&quot;You okay?&quot; She asked, watching Cassie&#146;s facial anxiety, &quot;Why are you 
just standing there?&quot;

The blonde genius looked through the glass of the door. &quot;...Shannon will 
be in there...&quot;

&quot;Shannon?&quot; Alyshia finally stood upright, &quot;Forget about her. Don&#146;t let 
her spoil your day. Look, if it bothers you so much, I&#146;ll sit with you 
today. Okay?&quot;

Cassie could only nod her normally shy way. It was nice that she had 
Alyshia&#146;s support in this. Because she really needed it. But Cassie did 
not assume that her support would amount to much. There was very little 
that seemed to ease the intimidation that Cassie felt from Shannon 
Marson. Alyshia acted first; pressing open the door and walking inside. 
Cassie followed along. The whole class turned and watched the two girls 
amble into the room with their Chemistry books in hand. But needless to 
say, their teacher, Miss Susan Brooks, was less than cheerful to see 
them.

&quot;Alyshia, Cassie,&quot; Miss Brooks recited, &quot;You&#146;re both over twenty minutes 
late. Do you care to explain that to me...?&quot;

Alyshia went first, releasing a nervous giggle. &quot;Oh well, you know me, 
Miss Brooks, I&#146;m such daydreamer, I kinda got on the wrong bus to 
school, and came late! Sorry about that...&quot;

Miss Brooks just ignored the childish giggles of the class and turned 
her attentions to Cassie. &quot;Well, what about you? Normally, you&#146;re the 
first to get here, Cassie.&quot;

The expression on Cassie&#146;s face reflected her awkwardness. She didn&#146;t 
even have to look up to know that Shannon and her cohorts were already 
picking fun at her. The girl let her cute blue eyes lower to the ground, 
hoping that the redness in her cheeks would die down at some point. 
&quot;...I&#146;m sorry, Miss Brooks. I had to help my Dad with something before 
he left home and it took longer than I expected. I&#146;ll make up whatever 
work I missed.&quot;

&quot;...It&#146;s fine,&quot; Miss Brooks offered with delay, &quot;Just don&#146;t make a habit 
of it.&quot;

To that, both Cassie and Alyshia nodded. Then began walking to the only 
two seats that were left in the classroom. And, strangely enough, they 
were directly parallel to where Shannon  and some of her friends were 
sitting. The exact kind of set up that Cassie was dreading. But she 
still tried her hardest to keep from looking at Shannon. Or listen to 
the inane giggles that Shannon exchanged with her friends. Alyshia took 
a seat on the stool at the chosen chemistry table. Cassie took the one 
next to her, which was adjacent to Shannon&#146;s seat by about a metre. 
Cassie&#146;s mind was precise like that. Miss Brooks began addressing the 
class again, and the students started pulling up hands to answer 
questions. While Alyshia slapped her thick Chemistry book on the table, 
Cassie did the same. And then she froze as she heard Shannon call out 
her name.

&quot;Hey Cassie,&quot; She whispered deviously, &quot;Didn&#146;t you enjoy your wet 
t-shirt contest last Saturday...? I know we did!&quot;

Cassie tightened up from the inside. Just as Shannon started laughing. 
She couldn&#146;t take this anymore. Why did Shannon seem to enjoy making her 
miserable? But while Cassie was willing to reluctantly accept that kind 
of crap, Alyshia was not ready to watch a friend take it. 

Alyshia turned and gave a hateful glare at the trendy. &quot;Hey Shannon, why 
don&#146;t you just back off for once, alright? Unless you get off on being a 
bitch.&quot;

The glare that Shannon cast back was even more hateful. &quot;What did you 
call me?!&quot;

And of course, that little verbal scrap would have continued if not for 
the influence of Miss Brooks. The whole class stopped as Miss Brooks 
stopped, then she gave a look down the aisle of tables to the back. 
Alyshia and Shannon both silenced themselves as Miss Brooks was made 
aware of the noise. And neither wished to incur *her* wrath. There was 
no need for the teacher to say anything. Shannon and Alyshia dipped 
their noses back into their Chemistry books. Miss Brooks went back to 
teaching. And Shannon was effectively silenced. For now, anyway. Cassie 
remained silent, but opened her book to the chosen page and kept her 
head down. Though in her mind, she was thanking whoever needed to be 
thanked for making Alyshia her friend.

**********

Lunch break. 

The all-female, all-teen populous of Atlantic High buzzed around from 
the lunch line to their respective tables. Each tray they carried was 
packed with the junky yet semi-appealing foods that had come to be 
trademarks of American schools. And this was not lost on high schools in 
Victoria.  Like usual, all the tables were divided into high school 
&#145;class&#146; system. The trendies stuck with the trendies, the cheerleaders 
stuck with the cheerleaders, the geeks stuck with the geeks, and those 
on the fringe stuck with those on the fringe. Over in the centre of the 
room was the table that Summer, Jenny and Holly-Raine usually sat by. 
And all three got their chance to sit there. Summer was in a bright 
mood, as usual. But even more so today, because every once in a while, 
someone would come up and congratulate her on how great her birthday 
party was. Which felt great. Because her parents came back tomorrow and 
she would have liked to have thought that her time while they away 
wasn&#146;t wasted. Jenny was equally happy. Mostly because she had made a 
huge result on Saturday. She met a guy! 

And it occurred to Summer that she didn&#146;t know how that went for her. 
&quot;Hey, Jenny. Now that I think about it, what happened between you and 
that guy? From the smile on your face, I can tell he worked a number on 
you, right?&quot;

Jenny blushed vividly. &quot;I guess love must be in the air or something if 
you could guess. God, he is so sweet, Summer. And so kind, and so 
funny... I can&#146;t believe he was actually single.&quot;

&quot;Well are you going to give me a name?&quot; Summer prodded. 

&quot;Nathan,&quot; Jenny answered timidly, &quot;Not only is he cute, and funny, and 
smart, he&#146;s captain of his Football Team at Saffron Jameson High. And he 
is so fine... I can&#146;t believe I met him at a party...&quot;

Summer ran a hand through her hair, smiling. &quot;Uh oh! Why do I get the 
feeling that I can hear wedding bells ringing?&quot;

&quot;...S-Shut up!&quot; Jenny jabbed sweetly, &quot;I ... don&#146;t know if he wants to 
start anything serious with me just yet... but I can see Nathan and I 
going steady in the future. He called me last night and said he had 
Football Practice today. Once he&#146;s finished, he&#146;s going to pick me up so 
we can go someplace. I don&#146;t know where he&#146;s taking me... but I know it 
will be special...&quot;

Summer&#146;s hand rested against her cheek, propping her up. &quot;Oh man. You 
are so sprung. Hey, are you hearing this, Holly?&quot;

Holly-Raine didn&#146;t answer. The girl simply looked down into her plastic 
plate full of cafeteria food, twirling her fork in it. A dreamy sigh 
escaped her lips. And her eyes felt somehow heavier than they usually 
looked. Summer began to notice that something was bothering her. But 
even Holly-Raine couldn&#146;t completely understand what she was feeling 
here. The brown haired girl felt so desperate and mild ever since she 
saw Sharon this morning. Sharon was just so earth-shatteringly 
beautiful. Holly felt like slapping herself the moment she first laid 
eyes on her. But yet... it was different from the girls she had crushed 
on before. Take Ella for example. Holly-Raine found Ella to be hot, that 
was for sure, but she didn&#146;t have any real feelings for her. The same 
went for all her other past sexual conquests. But this time... something 
felt different. This felt... special. Real. Just the idea of seeing 
Sharon made Holly felt all tingly and numb inside. What was she feeling?

She tried to catch up with Sharon as soon as History Class was over. But 
Holly couldn&#146;t find her anywhere. And now Holly-Raine was just left with 
this aching, binding feeling of longing. And because of this, Holly 
could barely look up from her plate to respond to her friend Summer. 
Until she heard something that caught her interest...

&quot;Hey, it&#146;s Sharon.&quot;

Holly blinked as Summer spoke that name. &quot;W-What...?&quot;

True to form, Summer was speaking the truth. And Holly-Raine&#146;s stomach 
began stirring with that classic sensation of butterflies. The 
auburn-haired seductress sat wide-eyed and speechless as that beautiful 
girl, Sharon Daniels, walked past the surroundings and strode to their 
table, a lunch tray in hand. Holly tightened up again, forcing her palms 
into her lap and lowering her face as Sharon came up to their table. 

The girl slapped hands with Summer. &quot;How are things, Summer? You staying 
out of trouble? I hear you had one big bash last week.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, you know how it is, Sharon,&quot; Summer began to reply as Sharon took a 
seat next to her, which put her in front of an uncharacteristically 
nervous  Holly-Raine, &quot;Same old, same old. You should have come to the 
party on Saturday. It was a blast.&quot;

Sharon nodded. &quot;I can imagine. But my Mom was kinda busy with the move, 
and all. She made me and my Dad help out. It sucks but, it&#146;s not like I 
had much choice about it.&quot;

&quot;No problemo. There&#146;s always next year for another birthday bash. Oh 
yeah! I haven&#146;t really introduced you all yet, have I?&quot; Summer turned to 
Jenny and Summer, &quot;You guys, this is my friend, Sharon. We met a 90&#146;s 
Rock tribute a few months ago. And Sharon, these are my two best 
friends, Jenny...&quot;

Sharon gestured to Jenny. &quot;Hiya.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you.&quot; The other girl replied. 

&quot;And,&quot; Summer then turned to Holly-Raine (who still remained quiet). 
&quot;This is Holly.&quot;

Sharon smiled at Holly, waving Summer off. &quot;...We already met this 
morning. Right?&quot;

Holly-Raine simply nodded. She had never acted like this in her life. 
She could hardly speak for fear of saying something stupid. And yet she 
could barely bring herself to tear her eyes away from Sharon. Talk began 
to spring up around the table. Jenny was rather curious as to the 
connection between Summer and Sharon, for unknown reasons. But she 
seemed cheerful enough about it. But while the other three spoke, 
Holly-Raine kept quiet, exchanging a bite of her food with a glimpse of 
Sharon every few moments. She could hardly stand it. And it was so 
different to what she had experienced before. In the past, Holly would 
just make a move on a girl that she liked. With Sharon she felt so... 
hesitant. What if Sharon wasn&#146;t interested? A girl as pretty as Sharon 
was; had to have had a boyfriend or girlfriend, right? Holly-Raine 
squirmed on the inside from thinking that. Just the idea of someone else 
with Sharon actually made her angry. But despite the tornado of 
startling emotions that Holly was enduring, she managed to keep a lid on 
it without making herself look too anxious. This lasted through the 
seemingly elongated twenty minutes that the four girls spent together, 
eating lunch. Until...

&quot;...Oh man,&quot; Summer took a gander at the watch on her wrist, &quot;Jenny, we 
forgot about that extra credit work we&#146;re supposed to be putting in for 
Home-Ec. Dammit!&quot;

Jenny reflexively stood up as Summer did the same. &quot;You&#146;re kidding me? 
We&#146;re late for the first day?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, so c&#146;mon,&quot; Summer slapped her fork down on the tray and sighed, 
&quot;Holly, Sharon, we&#146;ll have to catch up with you guys later. If my 
brilliant friend Jenny could remember these things it wouldn&#146;t be a 
problem...&quot;

Jenny pouted and followed Summer as she began walking. &quot;Oh no you don&#146;t! 
You aren&#146;t blaming this one on me, Summer Andrews!&quot;

Sharon pointed over her shoulder at Summer &amp; Jenny as they walked away 
quickly. &quot;What&#146;s up with those two? They&#146;re like a pair of catty sisters 
that can&#146;t do without each other at the same time.&quot;

Holly finally found the words to say something worthwhile. &quot;...Yeah... 
but that&#146;s how I like them. Because it&#146;s how I&#146;ve always known them.&quot;

&quot;So...&quot; Sharon smiled curiously at the slightly younger girl, resting 
her cheek in her propped up palm, &quot;You can speak then? I&#146;m glad to see 
that you can. After all, you don&#146;t strike me as a shy girl. Especially 
after what Summer told me about you.&quot;

Holly blinked, looking up. &quot;W-What did Summer tell you... about me?&quot;

&quot;That you&#146;re the most confident &#145;member&#146; of your little group. And 
despite the fact that you can be a bit selfish sometimes... your heart&#146;s 
always in the right place when it needs to be.&quot;

The auburn-haired girl smiled to herself. &quot;She really said that about 
me?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Sharon nodded, &quot;She thinks really highly of you and Jenny. Makes 
me kind of jealous. I don&#146;t really have any childhood friends. Since Mom 
&amp; Dad moved here from Sacramento, I haven&#146;t spoken to or seen many of 
the kids I knew back then.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry to hear that.&quot; Holly offered. 

Sharon just waved that off. &quot;Ah, don&#146;t be. None of those guys were 
really all that charming to be honest. Besides, I like it more in 
Victoria. It&#146;s a sleepy kind of town compared to what I&#146;m used to, but, 
it feels like home.&quot;

Holly-Raine marvelled at that look of distant nostalgia that flashed in 
Sharon&#146;s eyes. Even that little quirk was appealing to Holly. And now 
that her atypically timid shell was starting to break a bit, Holly 
became more open. The girl pushed aside her tray for the moment and 
tried to get a bit more comfortable. If she was going to make any 
headway with Sharon she at least needed to be a bit more talkative. 

&quot;I&#146;m glad you like it here in Victoria,&quot; Holly-Raine fidgeted with her 
hands a little bit, &quot;And I hope you like it at Atlantic High. 
Saffron-Jameson might be a bigger school, but, I like this place a whole 
lot more. It&#146;s easy to make friends here.&quot;

Sharon smiled. &quot;You&#146;ve given proof of that, right? But we still don&#146;t 
know much about each other. And if my watch is right then we have about 
ten more minutes till class starts. So I&#146;ll tell you what. How about a 
movie? Just you, me, and the Big Screen. You can clue me in on this 
school and, I&#146;ll even pay. So what do you think?&quot;

&quot;...Sure. I&#146;d love to catch a movie with you,&quot; Though Holly&#146;s face was 
rather relaxed, inside she singing to the angels. She and Sharon alone 
together? &quot;...How about tomorrow? I know it&#146;s a school night... but... I 
can always sneak back home without my Dad finding out.&quot;

&quot;Perfect!&quot; Sharon then stood up, taking one last sip of the carton 
orange juice on her tray. Holly watched her throat bob up and down with 
each gulp of juice swallowed by those gorgeous pursed pink lips. By the 
time Sharon was finished, Holly-Raine was beginning to notice a wetness 
between her thighs. Which she ignored until Sharon spoke again, &quot;I guess 
I&#146;ll catch you later, okay?&quot;

Holly gave a muffled grunt of understanding and watched as Sharon walked 
away, slowly darting through all the noisy tables towards the exit on 
the other side of the room. And the jade-eyed girl sighed longingly. 
Tomorrow she would be alone with Sharon. Outside of school and free to 
do what they wanted to. Tomorrow... 

**********

A sparkling illumination shone down on the two lovers from above. The 
light of the moon. It was beautiful here in St. Lucia. The sun-kissed 
beaches and smooth crashing sounds of the sapphire blue waves were just 
so romantic. Especially at night. That was when all the loudness of the 
tourists ended and those who took note... could sample the sweetness of 
the whole beach. It created an atmosphere that Holly-Raine just soaked 
up with open arms. Because what more could she ask for? After all, she 
was accepting this beautiful place within the arms of her lover...

She loved this. Just being with Sharon in this way. The two young women 
held each softly, no words being spoken, just holding each other. They 
clung together across the multi-coloured blanket that had been smothered 
out over the layers of golden sand that made up the beach. They were 
just a short distance from the edge of the sea, the waves splashing 
about a short few metres ahead of them. Holly-Raine had her head nestled 
on the small cleft between both of Sharon&#146;s pert breasts, a careless 
smile on her face. Holly had been waiting for this for so long. Just the 
chance to be alone with Sharon, to be next to her.  To hear her 
breathing, to feel her heart beating. After waiting so long.

Sharon tightened the binding hug that she had around Holly&#146;s torso, just 
looking out into the crashing waves of the sea. &quot;Everything okay? You 
seem sort of quiet right now.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m...&quot; Holly gave herself the time to speak, &quot;...I&#146;m just happy to be 
here with you. To be with you like this. It doesn&#146;t work back home. With 
so many things standing in the way...&quot;

That she understood. The slightly older girl ran one of her soft hands 
through Holly&#146;s equally soft brown hair, soothing her. It wasn&#146;t like 
Sharon was completely oblivious to what they had to go through in their 
relationship. So many obstacles to fight through, so many tricks to deal 
with. But that was one of the reasons they came to St. Lucia with their 
parents. To get away from all of that nonsense. This was their time. 
What else could they do but enjoy it?

&quot;Don&#146;t worry so much, Holly,&quot; Sharon whispered, continuing her smooth 
stroking of the younger girl&#146;s hair, &quot;...We can worry about that stuff 
when we go home. Right now... we should just concentrate on each other 
now. For starters...&quot;

Holly released a tranquil sigh as Sharon&#146;s probing hand moved from her 
silky chestnut hair toward the south. That gentle hand moved down the 
clear tones of her neck, then down to her chest where it remained. 
Sharon gave a playful squeeze of the small, firm mound, all the while a 
frank wetness began emerging between her thighs. Holly-Raine could 
pretty much sense that Sharon was burning for her. Because her own body 
reacted in the exact same way. Sharon shuffled her body around so that 
Holly&#146;s torso was laid flat across the towel on the sand. And the older 
girl gave a confident smile, mounting Holly from the waist, her legs 
seamlessly straddling Holly&#146;s hips. And as Sharon looked down at her, 
Holly took note of that look of desire and lust that raged around her 
dark blue eyes. It pleased Holly immensely to know that she could bring 
forth such a reaction from her girlfriend. But it wasn&#146;t just because 
Holly was decked out in a skimpy black two piece bikini. It was because 
there was something between them... something special... something that 
neither of them had the power to resist. Holly-Raine smiled to herself 
as Sharon lowered her face a little. Before she reached within kissing 
distance, the younger woman rested her left palm against the smooth pale 
cheek of her lover. 

...And Holly felt her heart throbbing... &quot;I love you, Sharon...&quot;

**********

Holly&#146;s head jerked up in realization. Things felt dazed. All she knew 
was that she felt something wet, and it wasn&#146;t the waves of a sea 
crashing against a beach. The young woman looked down to see what was 
causing that &#145;wet&#146; feeling. Her elbow had knocked over her  carton of 
orange juice. And that same elbow was swimming in the orangey liquid 
that had filled her lunch tray. Suddenly she remembered just where she 
was. In the cafeteria, sitting by her usual table, on her own. Most of 
the other students had packed up and headed for class, aside from a few 
stragglers. So she got her head back into focus. She would probably be 
late for her next class if she didn&#146;t hurry it up a bit. Holly-Raine 
stood from the plastic chair she had sat down on, then lifted her tray 
and made a short-paced dash for the lunch line. She chucked her unwanted 
remainder of lunch into the large trash bin at the side of the lunch 
line counter, then put her tray on the pile of others. With that done, 
the brown-haired girl exited the lunch room. But her thoughts were 
running a mile a minute. What was she feeling here? Why was she thinking 
like that? Holly-Raine was a dreamer, but her dreams and fantasies were 
never anything like that. They were always playful and sexual. But 
that... vision of her and Sharon together didn&#146;t feel the least bit 
sexual. It felt... romantic. And from thinking of that scene, of Sharon 
laying over her on a Caribbean beach, the teen experienced another of 
those butterflies-in-the-stomach sensations. It was becoming 
overwhelming. And it grew in strength every time that Holly&#146;s mind came 
to Sharon Daniels.

...Sharon...

Before she made it to her next class, Holly-Raine slumped against the 
wall of the corridor she was walking through. A few other students 
passed her by, giving her odd looks, but she ignored all of them. All 
her mind was centred on was Sharon. And the sudden feelings that were 
springing up in her heart from meeting her.  What did all this mean? Was 
she...?

Holly had to ponder the question in words. &quot;...Am I falling in love with 
her...?&quot;

Chris Angel says,

* As you can see, there&#146;s no sex in this chapter. I think it would have 
cheapened the seriousness of Holly&#146;s sudden change in emotion. And 
there&#146;s very little Debbie/Linda in this chapter, mostly because they 
dominated the last one. 

* Thanks to Jackie. B for her request. It&#146;s about time that Sharon made 
an appearance. Keep those requests coming and I&#146;ll keep churning out 
chapters for ya. As usual if you have any comments, e-mail me. I&#146;d love 
to hear from you. 

* Just to clear up a few confusions, &#145;Shannon Marson&#146;  and &#145;Sharon 
Daniels&#146; are two completely different people. I apologize for the 
similar names, but I pick names that suit the personality so I was 
caught in a bind, really. Oh and to re-affirm the point, the 
Misadventures of Holly-Raine takes place *before* the Misadventures of 
Anna. That&#146;s all! ^_^
