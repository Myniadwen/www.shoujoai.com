The redhead walked into the room, her eyes casually sweeping the
figures who were sitting there waiting for the meeting to begin. &quot;So
Cathy,&quot; Aileen said softly into her throat mic, &quot;can you tell me who
the competition is?&quot;

Using the mini-cameras on Aileen&#39;s clothes Cathy must have run some
image comparisons, because she answered her remarkably quickly. &quot;The
schoolgirl blonde in the corner chewing gum is Thrill-kill, a wanted
woman in twenty states so far,&quot; she said crisply. &quot;She&#39;s an impulse
killer, so be careful around her,&quot; she cautioned.

Aileen tried to not let her surprise show, but it was hard. The
little blonde looked like she had just walked off some campus,
looking around the room curiously while she happily chewed her
bubblegum. The mini-skirt and blouse couldn&#39;t have concealed a
weapon if they wanted, though she did have a curiously large purse
beside her.

&quot;The young man dressed all in black calls himself Solitude,&quot; Cathy
continued on, &quot;he&#39;s a Goth wanna-be who kills with his knives
mostly. He&#39;s good at faking suicides, so he hasn&#39;t got much a
criminal record yet.&quot;

The black haired Solitude really did look a bit like a wanker, his
stylish hair and black clothes giving him an artificial air. Still,
the gleam in his eyes wasn&#39;t faked, the look of a man who not only
killed but who enjoyed doing it.

Aileen didn&#39;t need help recognizing the next killer. &quot;Sister
Rosette...&quot; she murmured, looking at the woman dressed in a
traditional nun&#39;s robes, her rosary hung around her neck. But she
wasn&#39;t a sister in any order that Aileen knew, instead using her
steel wire rosary to strangle and her robes to conceal a multitude
of weapons.

&quot;Rosette&#39;s been busy,&quot; Cathy agreed, &quot;she&#39;s got several more kills
in the last few months, as well as some I can&#39;t confirm as hers but
bearing her signature.&quot;

&quot;Is she taking the anti-psychotics still?&quot; Aileen asked, vividly
remembering the one time that she had been at ground zero when
Rosette had completely lost it. The woman had gruesomely killed the
pastor of a small county church and the only reason that Aileen
hadn&#39;t intervened had been that he was their target.

&quot;According to on-line sources, her prescription is up to date,&quot;
Cathy answered as Aileen sat a little apart from the others.

&quot;Great,&quot; Aileen murmured.

&quot;The other guy is alias Pyre,&quot; Cathy continued, &quot;as you can imagine
he&#39;s a pyromaniac. He gets off on burning things or ideally people,
with multiple arson accusations but few convictions.&quot; A pause, &quot;He&#39;s
a brilliant chemist, igniting nearly untraceable fires.&quot;

Pyre looked deceptively average, brown hair falling into his eyes
and glasses gleaming. The only unusual thing about him was the faint
twitch in his hands, almost as if he wanted to be flicking a lighter
or match, maybe. Dressed in his plain suit he could have been one of
a thousand businessmen, fading into the crowds easily.

&quot;And who is the last woman?&quot; Aileen asked, looking over at the black
haired woman who was leaning up against the wall, her long hair
falling limply around her face. Compared to all the others in the
room she was dressed rather sloppily in a battered looking sweater
and jeans, looking away from the various killers shyly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Cathy admitted the fact reluctantly. &quot;She&#39;s not in
my criminal database, and I haven&#39;t got any hits off the FBI, CIA or
NSA networks,&quot; she said.

&quot;So she&#39;s new,&quot; Aileen murmured.

&quot;Or effectively off the usual radar,&quot; Cathy suggested grimly. &quot;Heads
up, looks like the boss is incoming,&quot; she warned.

Grace strode into the room in a wave of self-confidence, the black
haired woman looking over the band of killers thoughtfully. She was
gorgeous in her power suit and Aileen felt a flash of desire that
she quickly suppressed. No matter how beautiful she was Aileen knew
Grace was a ruthless killer, and not someone you ever wanted to
cross.

&quot;I want to thank you specialists for responding so quickly to our
request for qualified personnel,&quot; Grace said smoothly, &quot;I&#39;ll be
giving you a summary of the target and it&#39;s capabilities.&quot;

&quot;Neat,&quot; Thrill-kill murmured in a perky voice, sliding a bit forward
in her chair as the others paid close attention to Grace.

An image was posted behind Grace, the face of a human woman on one
side, then a much more demonic visage on the other side. &quot;This is
Descent,&quot; Grace said coldly, &quot;in both her human disguise and her
true form. She appears to be a demon, possessed with enhanced
strength, durability and regenerative powers.&quot;

&quot;Shapeshifter?&quot; the quiet one asked softly.

&quot;To an extent, Deathwish,&quot; Grace addressed the woman, &quot;survivors of
encounters have witnessed her growing claws, for instance.&quot;

&quot;What are her weaknesses?&quot; Pyre asked softly, eyes glowing with
eagerness.

&quot;I suspect it&#39;s vulnerable to fire,&quot; Grace purred then looked over
to Aileen, &quot;but why don&#39;t we have our expert explain?&quot;

Aileen got up, her simple black suit snug on her body. She could
feel assessing eyes on her and fought back as smile as she walked up
to Grace, nodding to her slightly. Looking at the group she
said, &quot;Descent is vulnerable to most forms of conventional injury,
but reports say that her regenerative capacity is remarkable.&quot;

&quot;Which means...?&quot; Solitude asked.

&#39;Fool,&#39; Aileen firmly kept her thoughts from her face as she
said, &quot;If you manage to hurt her you have to follow up on your
attack as fast as possible, you must keep on hurting her or she&#39;ll
simply heal up and kill you.&quot;

&quot;She just keeps going and going,&quot; Thrill-kill grinned, &quot;just like
the bunny. Good, I think she&#39;ll be fun to play with.&quot;

Aileen decided to just ignore that. &quot;Go to a priest and have your
weapons blessed,&quot; she said, &quot;it&#39;ll increase their effectiveness.
Also, holy water, silver and certain types of incense will slow down
or even poison a being like this.&quot;

&quot;The local Bishop has ordered his priests to do the blessings, no
questions asked,&quot; Grace added from where she casually stood nearby.

&quot;I don&#39;t really believe in God,&quot; Deathwish asked her softly, &quot;will
that make the blessed weapons ineffective?&quot;

&quot;Descent believes, I think,&quot; Aileen said to her dryly, &quot;and that&#39;s
all that matters.&quot; Silently she wondered at the deadness that she
saw in the other woman&#39;s brown eyes, a utter and complete
hopelessness that seemed to fill Deathwish. She looked away,
shivering a bit and said to Grace, &quot;I think that&#39;s about it.&quot;

&quot;Our other target is Sister Samantha Teresa, a priest from a obscure
religious order called the Knights Templar,&quot; Grace showed another
picture of a brown haired woman, her hair tied back in a
ponytail. &quot;She carried twin blessed pistols,&quot; she said, &quot;and has
certain abilities of a... holy nature.&quot;

Before anyone could ask Aileen said flatly, &quot;She&#39;s a paladin,
basically. She can heal with a laying on of hands, undead run away
from her normally and she can even track certain kinds of unholy
creatures mystically.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re an expert on this, too?&quot; Pyre asked with a sly smile.

Aileen gave him a flat look, silently warning him not to ask any
more. &quot;You could say that,&quot; she answered grimly.

&quot;The Lady will provide any additional equipment you need, within
reason,&quot; Grace said simply. A grim smile, &quot;The only regulation we&#39;re
imposing on you is this: while Descent and her ally are at the
Daughters of Artemis you will not attack them or attempt to damage
the nightclub.&quot;

&quot;Aww,&quot; Thrill-kill pouted,. &quot;why?&quot;

&quot;The bar is neutral territory,&quot; Grace said coldly, &quot;recognized by
the Lady herself. If any of you do decide to strike at the club, the
next bounty will be on your heads.&quot; With that Grace collected the
photos and papers and left, heels clicking on the floor.

Waiting a moment they all got up, but Solitude made a beeline
towards Deathwish. &quot;I know the rest of us here by reputation at
least,&quot; he said challengingly, &quot;but I&#39;ve never heard of you. What&#39;s
so special about you that Grace brought you in?&quot;

Deathwish looked at him a moment then said flatly, &quot;Cap me, right
through the head.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Pyre looked shocked.

Thrill-kill whipped out a Magnum from her purse faster than anyone
could see and fired, punching bullets through the grim young woman&#39;s
face and splattering her head up against the wall behind her. &quot;Don&#39;t
say I ever turned down a lady,&quot; she smirked.

&quot;You homicidal little....&quot; Solitude barked.

&quot;Look!&quot; Pyre squeaked.

Deathwish&#39;s body convulsed, body jerking wildly as if electricity
was being pumped through her corpse. With incredible speed her body
began to rebuild, blood, bone and flesh restoring themselves layer
by layer until she looked like she did before she was shot. As her
hair began to regrow Deathwish opened up her eyes, blinking a moment
to focus them.

&quot;My god,&quot; Aileen murmured.

Deathwish pushed herself up, scowling at the blood that splattered
her clothes. &quot;Brains are always a bitch to get out of clothes,&quot; she
grumbled then looked up to meet their shocked gazes. &quot;I can&#39;t die,&quot;
she explained grimly, &quot;though I wish I could.&quot;

&#39;This is going to be an interesting job,&#39; Aileen thought.</pre>
