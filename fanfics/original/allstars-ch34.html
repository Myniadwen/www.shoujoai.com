4:27 pm

 

There came a knock at Dean Rosewood&#39;s door; she bade them enter; it was 
Leena.

&quot;You wanted to see me, Stacie?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Sit down, please.&quot; The Finnish woman glanced around Rosewood&#39;s 
office as she approached the nearest chair and made herself comfortable. 
The difference between this room and Fitzgerald&#39;s was stark: his was 
somber, regal, and earthy; Rosewood&#39;s walls were bright and bare, with a 
halogen lamp in one corner and a large plant in the other, fed by 
sunlight from two windows, On Rosewood&#39;s desk were pictures of her 
family, her military circle, and a group of men and women that, if Leena 
had known who they were, it would&#39;ve surprised her to know the Head of 
the school shared acquaintance with. Stepping into Fitzgerald&#39;s place 
gave you the impression of entering a monk&#39;s cell; Rosewood&#39;s office 
felt more like an observatory, emptier and less practical but somehow 
more pleasant.

&quot;I&#39;ll be with you shortly,&quot; she murmured as she scribbled her way 
through several papers. &quot;Unfortunately, I&#39;m a very busy person, so most 
of my time is not my own. But I&#39;ve tried to sequester some hours for 
myself today, and that thusly leads me to the purpose of my call. Ah, 
there. You said you were married to a student, correct?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but this is her last year.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, that&#39;s right. And a woman. I was once in a rather 
&#39;questionable&#39; marriage myself,&quot; she grinned: &quot;I fell hopelessly in love 
with a subordinate officer and ended up giving him twenty years of my 
life and two beautiful children. Have you two ever thought about 
starting a family?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s never come up in conversation before,&quot; she admitted. &quot;I think 
we&#39;re in agreement that we&#39;re both too busy right now. But if and when 
we do, I&#39;d really like to adopt.&quot;

&quot;I could help you out if you&#39;d like,&quot; she offered warmly. She stiffened 
a little and adapted a more businesslike tone. &quot;But that&#39;s not really 
why I called you here, is it? Well. Now to the purpose of this meeting. 
First off, let me tell you how impressed I am at your team&#39;s victories. 
I&#39;m sorry to say that I actually doubted them for awhile, but seeing 
them play against Anolis and Lovelace turned my faith around. You&#39;re 
certainly living up to your reputation as a miracle-worker.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know I had a reputation like that,&quot; she smiled humbly. &quot;My 
methods really aren&#39;t so unique. It&#39;s the players that deserve the 
credit.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Second, and most important, I&#39;d like to inform you of a regret. 
Aside from missing time with my children, the thing I regret the most is 
not acquainting myself with you and your team. I&#39;m ashamed to say that, 
except for a few small details, and a few I&#39;ve interviewed personally, I 
really don&#39;t know any of them. I was hoping that we could all have an 
informal dinner together, you and I and the team. Of course, I&#39;d like to 
meet each of them individually, but none of us have the time for that, 
and besides, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be able to understand the whole team 
dynamic that way.&quot;

&quot;It sounds like a great idea,&quot; Leena said. &quot;Let me run it by the girls 
and see what we can organize. When do you think you&#39;d like to have 
this?&quot;

&quot;On a weekend, most certainly. Perhaps a Saturday, if possible.&quot; Leena 
made a face.

&quot;It&#39;d have to be sometime next week. The girls are all going over to our 
team manager&#39;s house this weekend to celebrate their victory.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she mumbled sadly, &quot;I&#39;m going to be busy next weekend, and every 
other one after that. This was the only time I could have an entire day 
off. How about this Thursday? Would that be any better?&quot;

&quot;I guess that could work,&quot; she said. &quot;Let&#39;s see how they take it first. 
I mean, I like your idea, and I totally agree, it&#39;s just...the timing of 
it all.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered wistfully. &quot;I would be grateful, Leena. Do call me 
when you have an answer.&quot;

&quot;All right. Thanks.&quot; They smiled and waved to each other; Stacie glanced 
at her calendar once the younger woman had left the room. She put a 
large question mark on Thursday the thirteenth, then glanced at her next 
few weekends. On each one was marked, in bold red letters, &quot;M &amp; J&quot;.

 

In this wide world

People you&#39;re meant to meet can be seen

Beyond the window, beyond the rainbow

I think you&#39;re aware of them

Take off that restrictive weight

Let your feelings go

Now keep your ears open and wait for that time

Awaken now

Cherish the little dream you&#39;ve drawn in the vast sky

If you do, you can always become happy

It&#39;s certain, whoa whoa!

 

&quot;Potpourri&quot;

 

Retired General, Dean Anastasia Rosewood was an attractive, intelligent, 
patient woman in her early fifties, born in England and raised in two 
worlds. The first was a world of propriety, decorum, wealth, education, 
dignity, and esteem; the second was the world of the military. Although 
most people saw her as she had been in her first world- a prudent, 
polite, wise woman who rarely raised her voice and always treated people 
professionally- she excelled in both. Even during her career as a 
General, first for the British Army and then for an &quot;undisclosed pocket 
of independents&quot;, she rarely moved out of this world and always made 
sure to use her voice and her heart and her mind instead of force. But 
woe to those she used this final measure on: she vigorously kept her 
military training every day, and could best most people half her age.

When she entered the Lily Club and found the table reserved for her and 
her seventeen guests- they all decided to dine there, since they felt it 
was the one place they could relax and &quot;be themselves&quot; (except Shannon, 
who preferred steakhouses)- a lot of people paused to stare at the 
graceful woman. Rosewood was gorgeous for a woman in her fifties: she 
had long dark hair she kept tied up in braids at the back of her head, 
fair skin, penetrating eyes that could be warm caresses one moment and 
steely daggers the next, a figure most women half her age would kill 
for, and a hushed gray business dress. She looked nearer forty than 
fifty, and her British accent was like a clear rushing river, enchanting 
and rich. On the other hand, she was a workaholic, and it showed in her 
eyes and her face and her gait even as she smiled and joined the team.

&quot;What a marvelous place!&quot; she exclaimed as she sat. &quot;I feel so horrible 
for neglecting this campus. I really should take a week off and just 
tour the place. Ah- yes, hello, good afternoon. I&#39;m sorry for making you 
all wait like this, but my duties are rather pressing. But maybe now 
we&#39;ll have some time. Let us make introductions: I am Anastasia 
Rosewood, pleased to meet you.&quot; She tried to memorize the other names 
announced, adding an occasional, &quot;Ah, so you&#39;re that person,&quot; and, &quot;Yes, 
I remember you now,&quot; but in the end, she was forced to give everyone 
nametags. The woman named Felicity waved at someone, and Rosewood turned 
her head to see a cute-looking girl in glasses with a Rainbow Bright 
t-shirt approaching.

&quot;Hey, kitties! Is this your team?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah, every last one. Do you need me to introduce you?&quot;

&quot;No thanks,&quot; she grinned, &quot;I can read. Um...so which one of you two is 
the Coach?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s me,&quot; Leena waved. &quot;This one is the Head of the school, Ms. 
Rosewood.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, the former General. Awesome! Can I have your autograph?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid to say my celebrity retired with me,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;Aww. Well, eighteen gorgeous women gathered in my place! Must be my 
lucky day. How can I serve you ladies?&quot; Everyone made their order and 
the woman wandered back to the kitchen.

&quot;A friend of yours?&quot; Rosewood asked.

&quot;Uh, yeah, that&#39;s Gardenia. She owns the place.&quot;

&quot;Flower girl wonderful boss,&quot; Nadia chirped.

&quot;She seems like a nice person. Why don&#39;t you all tell me a little bit 
about yourselves while we&#39;re waiting? Miss Berkeley, why don&#39;t you 
start? My son and daughter have told me a lot about you.&quot;

&quot;Your son and...&quot; She trailed off, trying to remember when she had ever 
made and impression on two junior Rosewoods. It wasn&#39;t until Stacie 
identified them did she understand: &quot;Oh, you&#39;re Mary and Jerry&#39;s mother? 
But your names are...uh, I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t mean to be rude. It&#39;s just 
that I didn&#39;t know...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no offense,&quot; she said. &quot;Rosewood is my maiden name; Belfiske is my 
married one. I had it changed back ten years ago, when my husband passed 
on. That was also around the time when I was promoted to General, so I 
like to think of it as a way of protecting my children.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see. Well then, something about myself? Oh, Ms. Rosewood, there&#39;s 
really nothing there. I&#39;m not special at all.&quot;

&quot;Eleeza modest,&quot; Nadia grinned, giving her a flirty shove. &quot;Eleeza best 
on whole team- very sweet, so pretty, awesome player, good at music. Am 
loving her deeply.&quot;

&quot;Nadia, please,&quot; she murmured, turning red. Rosewood waved dismissively.

&quot;It seems your friend has a high opinion of you. There&#39;s clearly 
something about you that attracted Leena so much.&quot;

&quot;You mean my athletic skills? Oh no, ma&#39;am, I&#39;m a living disaster. You 
saw the way I acted during our first practice game. I nearly ruined 
everything.&quot;

&quot;I apologized for yelling at you, didn&#39;t I?&quot; Fausta grumbled. She turned 
to Rosewood and said, &quot;The truth is, Elisa&#39;s too self-depreciating for 
her own good. But she&#39;s incredibly gifted and smarter than most of us 
put together.&quot;

&quot;Fausta, honestly...&quot;

&quot;I can see why my son and daughter like you so much,&quot; Rosewood grinned. 
&quot;And being English certainly helps out.&quot;

&quot;Actually, ma&#39;am, I&#39;m almost certain I&#39;m Irish.&quot;

&quot;Well, regardless, you seem like a wonderful person, and a good addition 
to the team. Now- you, uh, Miss Khovansky. Did I pronounce that 
correctly? Ah. Tell me about yourself.&quot;

&quot;Not too much. Have crazy Babushka that will flirt with you if give 
chance, so pleaze have careful.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t be the first time,&quot; she muttered wryly.

&quot;Um...also have been in Enkland for short time, but family move to 
America. We&#39;ve been to many place. Sorry if language iz not so good. 
Have not lived there long.&quot;

&quot;You have a very charming dialect,&quot; she assured her. &quot;Now- who else? 
You, Miss Ofdensen, I know a little about, as I do Miss Nazario and Miss 
Howlet. But I&#39;d like to hear a bit more. How are you all faring now that 
you&#39;ve actually experienced all this? No regrets, I hope.&quot;

&quot;Uhh, here and there,&quot; Lauren gestured. &quot;But overall, it&#39;s been pretty 
cool.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s different, I&#39;ll say that,&quot; Fausta smirked.

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Rain muttered. &quot;Don&#39;t tell Mr. Fitzgerald, but 
honestly, I like it here better. I didn&#39;t...I didn&#39;t have friends 
before, if you know what I mean. And I&#39;ve never felt like I was part of 
the circle until now.&quot;

&quot;You spent plenty of time around us before,&quot; Fleur indicated. &quot;As I 
recall, you seemed to waste a lot of your time, and the Chairman&#39;s, with 
these vagabonds.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t help it,&quot; she grinned goofily. &quot;Fencers may be sexier but 
soccer girls are more fun. Even you&#39;re more exciting than some of the 
stiffs I&#39;ve run into.&quot;

&quot;How flattering,&quot; she said bitterly. The food came around that time, 
borne by three employees who were working over Nadia&#39;s and Felicity&#39;s 
shifts. Fleur, as usual, had very little on her plate, and she ate it 
slowly, like it was her last meal. She smirked at Rosewood and wondered 
how she viewed the world. Se gave off the impression of being an 
altruist, even a deontologist, but the distant, professional haze in her 
eyes led Fleur to ultimately conclude she must be utilitarian. &quot;So, Ms. 
Rosewood, just what is your relationship with the Chairman?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve answered all the questions I needed to,&quot; she replied gently. &quot;I 
will say, however, that I trust him and admire him, though we rarely 
agree. Miss Lacroix, how about you? What is your role in all this? I&#39;ve 
begun to notice a camaraderie in the group that you seem to lack.&quot;

&quot;Is that wrong? I&#39;m just cooperating with them,&quot; she replied. &quot;These are 
not my friends and this is not my group. I&#39;m only here because it 
concerns the team- I have a soccer world and I have a social world. Kind 
of like you and your military-slash-professional career. You keep them 
segregated, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied evenly, &quot;but do you really want nothing more than a 
professional relationship with these women?&quot; Fleur shrugged as she 
chewed her broccoli.

&quot;I might sleep with a few. My mind&#39;s just as open as anyone else&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Except to being happy,&quot; Lauren muttered. Fleur gave her an expression 
that, even though she was smiling, could be interpreted as pure cold 
bitterness.

&quot;My dear Miss Ofdensen, you cannot say that and call yourself a 
psychologist. Surely you must realize that every human being craves 
pleasure: it&#39;s a universal truth. I am no exception. My interpretation 
is just different than yours. You&#39;re a hedonist and I&#39;m a nihilist. You 
like pleasure for pleasure&#39;s sake while I derive my happiness 
from...more experimental ventures. Even a masochist equates pain with 
pleasure; you&#39;d be hard-pressed to not want it.&quot; Lauren hadn&#39;t expected 
such an intellectual attack on herself, and didn&#39;t know whether to 
retaliate or keep her mouth shut. She decided not to respond for her 
team&#39;s sake.

&quot;It seems you have another very intelligent woman on your team,&quot; the 
Dean smiled. &quot;But not everything is as dark as it seems, Miss Lacroix. 
There must be one pure thing in your life.&quot;

&quot;Everything pure has been stained. There is no good, only spoiled 
goodness.&quot;

&quot;And the sex?&quot; Rain said. Fleur gave her an unreadable expression.

&quot;Egoism, my friend.&quot;

&quot;Okay, enough of this!&quot; Freya chirped, trying to lighten the mood. &quot;Ms. 
Rosewood- ah, guten aben- I was wondering what your view on human 
sexuality was. You see, I noticed you didn&#39;t even bat an eye when Fleur 
said she wouldn&#39;t mind sleeping with any of us, and you seemed perfectly 
at ease at the idea of Nadia&#39;s Babushka coming after you. I must admit 
that this is rather exceptional.&quot;

&quot;Is it?&quot; she murmured. &quot;I simply had many friends and subordinates who 
were like that. They were always just people to me, Miss von Hohenheim: 
nothing less. Getting to know the person convinced me there was nothing 
wrong with their choice. Of course, my own sexuality I must keep a 
secret, save that I am a mother of two and fiercely loved my husband 
while he was with me. Miss Velur, you&#39;ve been rather quiet. Why don&#39;t 
you change the subject for everyone?&quot;

&quot;There has actually been something I&#39;ve been thinking about lately,&quot; she 
confessed. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to play the part of the downer here, but I&#39;d 
really like to know what you and Leena think the future of our team will 
be.&quot;

&quot;Ah!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I was wondering when the conversation would lean 
that way. Very well: I suppose all pleasures must be dulled by business 
at times. Now that you are an official team, you will need to play 
official games. Football is an outdoor sport and the weather&#39;s still in 
your favor, so I&#39;d advise you to get some games in while you can. Not a 
practice match, I mean: a real game. If you doubt your readiness, 
perhaps I can relate the scores of your previous games to you, and my 
opinion regarding your performance.&quot;

&quot;So the shit has finally hit the fan, huh?&quot; Lauren grumbled.

&quot;Nothing so drastic or crude as that,&quot; Rosewood muttered, imperceptibly 
disgusted. &quot;You all knew this would be inevitable when you won that last 
game. You must now be placed against other teams for the right to 
participate in the national championship, as many games as possible, 
weather and time permitting. However, your opponents will be nothing 
like the imbalanced teams you&#39;ve previously been thrown against. 
Fitzgerald organized those to put you through the ultimate test, and now 
that you&#39;ve passed, it will be up to Leena, and perhaps myself or some 
other liaison, to arrange more appropriate rivals.&quot;

&quot;Such as?&quot; Kasumi said.

&quot;As I said, giving you superior opponents all the time would be fatal, 
but it would be just as grave giving you very easy teams to play 
against. In order to bring out your fullest potential, and in the 
interest of fair play, you must play against your inferiors, your 
equals, and your superiors. Not immediately, of course- no one expects 
you to jump back into the game so quickly after your victory- but quite 
soon down the road. As a matter of fact, it would behoove me to start on 
that immediately, so you must all please excuse me as I regrettably 
leave you for duller pastures. It has been a great pleasure and I have 
been honored to meet you all. I shall make an attempt to return here, 
when I can, but do not seek me out for chatter or idle social matters 
unless the matter is of great importance. You are in College now, and I 
cannot hold your hand. That task rests on your family, your friends, 
your teammates, or yourselves. Have a good weekend, everyone.&quot;

She smiled politely and paid for everyone&#39;s meals, with plenty of change 
to spare for a tip. Just like that she was gone, leaving everyone to 
stew in her own reactions. Felicity looked sheepish, worried that her 
concern had caused this sudden icy change, while a few of the others had 
the life drained from their eyes. They tried reasoning that even though 
the last two games were difficult, these next few would not be- but that 
didn&#39;t untie the knots in their stomachs. Few seemed excited or even at 
ease, but those few helped brighten the others with their morale.

&quot;So, our first official game as a team,&quot; Valencia said with a smile. &quot;I 
can&#39;t wait! If we can fight Anolis and Lovelace on equal footing, just 
think how we&#39;ll do against the others!&quot;

&quot;A few victories don&#39;t win a war,&quot; Fausta warned her sagely. &quot;Leena, 
what do you think about the future of our team?&quot;

&quot;Weren&#39;t you listening? Rosewood said that she&#39;d have someone take care 
of your games. Relax: this weekend is all yours, ladies. You&#39;ve earned 
your fun. But you had better enjoy it while it lasts. Day care has 
ended- boot camp is about to begin.&quot;

 

- Arina Essylt, Favorite color: red; team psychologist/reserve-

 

Someone casually driving along the road late Friday afternoon would see 
a cavalcade of cars coasting down the other end, perhaps wondering where 
such a group was headed. It was no funeral procession: the mood inside 
was festive, for they were going to finish a business they started 
earlier that week and relax for three consecutive days in the comfort of 
their manager&#39;s home. They quickly left the small city behind them and 
penetrated into the heart of the wide open country, rolling a few 
windows down to ventilate their cheer. Coming to meet them was Freya von 
Hohenheim&#39;s three-story estate, which only Amy had seen before- yet even 
she was still stunned by its wonder and beauty. It was one of those 
great old homes people rarely make anymore, but you can find in Europe 
just about everywhere, especially with the upper class. There were 
gardens, trails, a stable, a riding track, and even a small forest out 
back, its leaves bursting gold and orange in an autumnal flame. Although 
the garage was only big enough for Freya&#39;s car (or rather, Shiki&#39;s), 
there was plenty of room on the gravel for everyone else.

&quot;Aw, sweet!&quot; Lauren exclaimed, voicing everyone&#39;s opinion as she stepped 
out. &quot;Freya, this is a pimpin&#39; crib! Shit, girl, you got everything 
here!&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that. We&#39;re missing a launch pad. All right, everyone, 
this is it: your new home for the next three days! Take a gander.&quot; 
Freya&#39;s house towered over them, both inviting and intimidating. 
Everyone had managed to put some time away to come here, except for 
Leena, who said that she had had enough fun, and she would probably only 
get in everybody&#39;s way. Shiki and Maria were already inside preparing 
everything, but Ida, the only other resident and Freya&#39;s cousin, dashed 
out of the house to hug her older relative.

&quot;Mama! Vilkommen!&quot;

&quot;Oh- guten tag, liebkind!&quot;

&quot;So kawaii,&quot; Nadia grinned. Freya introduced everybody and Ida stated 
she was very happy to see them.

&quot;Now before we go inside,&quot; she pointed, &quot;there are a few rules I&#39;d like 
for you to abide by. You all are my friends and my honored guests, but 
please bear with me. First, please take off your shoes before going 
inside; there are cubbies you can store them in. Second, although you&#39;re 
free to eat anything you see in the kitchen, I&#39;d like for you to ask for 
it first. Also, we&#39;ll be catering tomorrow and having a cookout the next 
day, so don&#39;t fill up too much on what I have here. The third rule is 
that although you may explore at will, if you break or lose something, 
please be honest about it. Fourth, I have no rules regarding swimming 
attire, but for everyone&#39;s courtesy, please don&#39;t think this applies to 
the rest of the house. Fifth, I believe there are enough guest bedrooms 
and bathrooms for all of us, but...uh, if you want to share a room...or 
a shower...you are, of course, free to do so, providing you remember 
rule number four.&quot;

&quot;Sweet,&quot; Nadia grinned.

&quot;Oh, before I forget, please ask Shiki to assist you if you&#39;d like to go 
horseback riding. This is for your safety as much as anyone else&#39;s. And 
try not to wander too far out in the woods behind our property, 
particularly at night. Uh, let&#39;s see, what else? If you&#39;re going to stay 
up late and watch TV or play video games, I have plenty of headphones 
you can use so you don&#39;t disturb anyone else. Finally, the most 
important rule at all: DO NOT LEAVE THIS PLACE WITHOUT HAVING A GOOD 
TIME!!!&quot;

&quot;I like that rule,&quot; Terra smiled. &quot;So when&#39;s the pool going to be open?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll open it just as soon as I get there, and I&#39;ll be closing it when 
we all leave on Monday morning. So you can swim just about anytime you 
like.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m there,&quot; Ran blurted as she dashed inside. She kicked her shoes off, 
flung her shirt, and hopped out of her jeans, laughing and stumbling.

&quot;But you don&#39;t know the way!&quot; Freya exclaimed. That didn&#39;t seem to 
matter: Alice and Lauren were fast on her heels.

&quot;Shit...wait for us, Howlet!&quot; Girls&#39; clothes littered the ground as they 
raced for the pool; Freya grunted as she bent down to pick up some 
socks.

&quot;I probably should&#39;ve told them to pick up after themselves. I guess 
that&#39;s my fault, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;What can you do?&quot; Fausta shrugged. &quot;Some people are too infantile to 
listen. I think I&#39;ll go for a horse ride. If anyone else wants to come, 
I&#39;d be glad to have the company.&quot;

&quot;Finally, something I can enjoy!&quot; Elisa said zealously. She looked over 
at Nadia, who was predictably struggling out of her clothes. &quot;Um, 
honey...&quot;

&quot;Swimming time!&quot; she squealed, flinging shirt and bra away. Freya and 
Elisa both cried after her.

&quot;Hey, not in the house!&quot;

&quot;But you already brought a swimsuit!&quot; Nadia&#39;s shirt settled on 
Valencia&#39;s head.

&quot;Whoa, who turned out the lights?&quot;

 

Freya&#39;s indoor pool turned out to be a lot bigger than everyone 
anticipated. Although not Olympic-size, it was sufficient for a few 
laps, had a deep end of two meters, (which barely surpassed Alice&#39;s 
height), a shallow end where most everyone congregated, and even a small 
hot tub a few steps away. Rain and Alice were already playing tug-of-war 
with a Styrofoam tube; Lauren jumped in and started splashing wildly. 
Nadia stripped down to her bikini bottoms and leaped off the deep end, 
shamelessly exposing herself for all. Freya was a little more restrained 
when she joined them some minutes later, slipping out of her clothes 
into a gold one-piece.

&quot;Aww, Frey-Frey&#39;s not showing her naughty bits?&quot; Lauren pouted.

&quot;Maybe later,&quot; she giggled. &quot;Just once I want to swim with a suit on.&quot;

&quot;We should seriously come here more often,&quot; Rain said to Alice. 
Hawthorne agreed. Valencia came by later still, in a sizzling 
red-and-white bikini, dragging Kasumi by the wrist as she bounced 
energetically.

&quot;Come on, shy girl, into the water! Hey everybody, how ya doing? Listen, 
my girlfriend here&#39;s a little bashful. Can we make her feel welcome, 
please?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve just never swam with other people before,&quot; she muttered. Valencia 
smiled at her sweetly and embraced her.

&quot;You are so cute. Listen, why not show off that gorgeous body of yours? 
You&#39;ve got nothing to be ashamed of. We&#39;re all women here, Kasumi- and 
besides, some of them are going au naturel. D&#39;you think they&#39;re 
ashamed?&quot;

&quot;Hell no!&quot; Lauren cried. Even Freya was smiling at her, so finally, 
Kasumi crumbled under the peer pressure and undressed, revealing an 
ample endowment clasped by a solid blue top. She kept her shorts on, 
however, choosing to mix men and women&#39;s swimwear. Everyone whistled and 
Alice caught herself drooling; stars were in Valencia&#39;s eyes.

&quot;See? That wasn&#39;t so bad?&quot; They kissed gently; Kasumi felt like melting.

&quot;Yeah...but this is!&quot; She hoisted her girlfriend into the air and dumped 
her in the drink, then jumped in after her and splashed her until she 
submitted. Fleur cringed as she stepped in the room: her bikini was 
skimpier and looked like something a professional model would wear.

&quot;Really now, grow up! Ah, a hot tub! Mind if I indulge?&quot;

&quot;No, go right ahead. Say, do you all want some drinks?&quot;

&quot;Beer please?&quot; Lauren begged. Freya laughed and got out so she could use 
her pool phone (yes, a phone specifically built for the pool room).

&quot;Why not? Shiki, hi! Could you please bring...four, five, six...a wine 
cooler to the pool room? ...Uh, just a little bit of everything, would 
you? And maybe some snacks. ...Thanks, you&#39;re a dear. Oh, and you may 
join us once you&#39;ve taken care of that. Thank you.&quot; Freya smiled, hung 
up, and said, &quot;It is done.&quot;

&quot;I love you,&quot; Lauren purred as she slipped back into the water. &quot;You&#39;re 
like the best manager ever.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re not old enough to drink, Freya,&quot; Alice observed. &quot;Hardly any 
of us are.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous! Alita and Gauss buy me adult drinks all the time. 
We usually save them for special occasions, though. Besides, I&#39;m German, 
remember?&quot;

&quot;Right, you guys don&#39;t have that rule. ...Do you?&quot;

&quot;I had my first brew when I was Ida&#39;s age. Fleur, don&#39;t you want to come 
join us? Free drinks.&quot;

&quot;No way Captain Bring-down&#39;s ruining our fun!&quot; Rain snickered. She stuck 
her tongue out and Fleur waved.

&quot;I&#39;d prefer the hot tub. It&#39;s okay if I take my suit off, right?&quot;

&quot;Sure, release your inhibitions! Just please get dressed when you go 
back outside. And please, you all, pick up your clothes. Shiki is my 
maid, not yours.&quot;

&quot;That sounded kinky!&quot; Kasumi chortled. Valencia swam over to her, 
smiling seductively, and slipped underwater; Kasumi joined her and the 
two stared at each other in the murky depths. They kissed and 
resurfaced, their hair clinging to their faces. Shiki came by soon with 
a cooler full of &quot;adult-flavored beverages&quot;, most of them imports from 
Germany and Japan. Everyone got a glass and raised a toast to their team 
and their host, and kicked back as Shiki fully undressed and dove into 
the pool. She swam up and started playing with Freya&#39;s skin-tight 
outfit.

&quot;Hmm, you know, you actually look sexier with this thing on.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really? I&#39;ll have to remember that. Where&#39;s Mari-chan?&quot;

&quot;With Ida and a few of the others, playing video games.&quot;

&quot;And what about Fausta? Don&#39;t tell me you left her out there alone.&quot;

&quot;No, Berkeley-san and Nguyen-san are with her. They&#39;re quite exceptional 
riders. I figured they could handle themselves.&quot;

&quot;Ah. So everything&#39;s been taken care of.&quot;

&quot;Almost,&quot; she hissed, putting her mouth on Freya&#39;s neck as her hand 
wandered. The golden-haired girl felt hazy as she let out a pleasurable 
sigh, but blushed as she realized they had company. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think 
they&#39;ll mind,&quot; Shiki grinned wickedly. It didn&#39;t take her long to peel 
off Freya&#39;s shoulder straps, exposing her soft supple bosom.

&quot;Hey, stop staring,&quot; Valencia said, giving Kasumi a gentle smack. &quot;Or 
should I just take mine off as well?&quot;

&quot;Everybody go naked!&quot; Nadia squealed.

&quot;I&#39;m in favor of it,&quot; said Fleur from the hot tub. She stepped out, 
naked and dripping, as uninhibited as an animal as she waited for her 
body to cool. &quot;We&#39;re all adults, right? And none of us are particularly 
ugly. Well, Lauren could stand to lose some weight.&quot;

&quot;Hey, this is pure muscle, bitch. But I guess you wouldn&#39;t know what it 
looks like, huh? Shit, I&#39;d&#39;ve smacked you weeks ago if I wasn&#39;t so 
scared I&#39;d break you in half!&quot;

&quot;Like I&#39;d really want ugly man-muscles,&quot; she snorted as she thrust her 
feet inside. Freya&#39;s pool wasn&#39;t necessarily cold, but it came as a 
shock after boiling in the sauna for awhile. Fleur eventually slipped 
inside, wading around and smiling at everyone. Alice and Rain were the 
only ones that joined her.

&quot;What is her freakin&#39; problem,&quot; Kasumi sighed. She smiled wearily at 
Valencia, then turned purple as she saw a red and white striped bikini 
top dangling in front of her face. &quot;Uh, hey, you didn&#39;t have to do 
that...&quot;

&quot;But what if I wanted to?&quot; she chuckled, swimming around to Kasumi&#39;s 
back. She kissed the tomboy&#39;s pale muscular shoulders, her endless acres 
of skin, her firm spine and waist, fumbling with her top. Nadia saw the 
fun and waded over to help, and soon they had stolen her bikini top, 
hoisting it up like a battle-trophy. &quot;Hey, no fair! Give it back! Hey- 
no! Damn it, you guys, stop playing around! I mean it, seriously!&quot;

&quot;Woo-hoo, nice knockers!&quot; Kasumi fumed as she submerged up to her chin. 
They eventually threw it to Alice, who took one look before tossing it 
out of the pool, near the door. Just then, Felicity came by, curious to 
see what the pool looked like. She didn&#39;t even own a swimsuit, and had 
meant to buy one, but with school and work and all...

&quot;What&#39;s all the ruckus?&quot; she said. Velur froze as she noticed a gaggle 
of naked and half-naked girls thrashing around in the pool- Nadia among 
them- and a bikini top at her feet. She made a face and looked away as 
she knelt down to retrieve. &quot;Umm, okay, uh...&quot;

&quot;Over here, Felicity!&quot; Kasumi shouted, thrusting her arm up.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare!&quot; Valencia giggled. &quot;Take it and run! Run fast and far 
away!&quot;

&quot;Come on, Felicity, I&#39;m your roommate! Gimme a break, will ya!&quot; Felicity 
didn&#39;t want Kasumi to be embarrassed: she was a good friend and a good 
roommate. Not that she wasn&#39;t curious, of course...

&quot;I&#39;m just going to throw this back in, so...&quot; She hurled it amongst 
protests, and waved feebly as she headed out the door. Nadia quickly 
scampered out and, covered only by water and her bikini bottoms, caught 
up with her coworker and grabbed her arm.

&quot;No, pleaze, be staying with us! Kittiez not been having any fun. Very 
poor for Velur health. Promise we are not to biting.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to!&quot; she blurted, trying to keep her eyes 
averted. Sweet Sappho, Nadia had a beautiful body. &quot;I didn&#39;t bring my 
suit! I don&#39;t even own one! Besides, I...I just ate, and I was going to 
ride with Amy, and- &quot;

&quot;Bring kitty new girlfriend here for bouncy fun!&quot; Nadia squealed.

&quot;Yeah, it doesn&#39;t matter if you don&#39;t have anything to wear!&quot; Freya 
cheered. &quot;Just come on in! Don&#39;t be bashful! Even Kasumi came out here!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, only to have my top taken away!&quot;

&quot;Oh hush, dear, you loved it,&quot; Valencia purred. It seemed like Felicity 
had no choice: her inhibitions were melting and Nadia was dragging her. 
But she had only swam nude once, and that had been with a trusted 
friend. How could she ever expose herself like that in front of 
everybody?

&quot;But I don&#39;t really...I mean, I was going to- WHOA!&quot;

&quot;No whining! Bombz away!&quot; Nadia threw her inside, clothes and all. 
Felicity screamed and swore revenge once she had surfaced; everybody 
laughed as she flung water everywhere. To make up for her mischief, 
Nadia gave Felicity a drink, and they toasted again: to the wondrous 
lack of a dress code.

 

- Jennifer Andre, Favorite color: green; left midfielder-

 

There are nineteen of us here, including me: sixteen women on the team, 
two who act as our staff, and one presently in the custody of our 
manager and hostess. She is too young for alcohol and too young to swim 
naked with us, although some of the women get dressed for her sake, and 
clean up their language, and flash their charms less. During the 
duration of our stay, the pool rarely goes without some use. By day, 
it&#39;s filled with screaming, laughing, splashing barbarians; at night, 
lovers come here to caress each other under starlight and moonlight. 
Even I slipped in once, though I observed the rules of propriety and 
covered myself. I have the shabbiest swimsuit of them all, but it&#39;s 
sufficient for my purposes- and anyway, I&#39;d much rather spend my time 
elsewhere.

I do my best to keep with small crowds while I&#39;m here. These people want 
to pass themselves off as my friends, but I don&#39;t know who I can trust 
and who is just using that word casually, like they say hate and love 
and kill and sex. They&#39;d think I was crazy if I told them I trusted 
Fleur, but it&#39;s because she&#39;s so honest about herself, so unflinching 
about her beliefs. She may not have a good heart, but she admits it; 
she&#39;s almost proud of it. We talked and rode horses together, and she 
invited me into her bed for the night. I declined. I wanted my first to 
be with someone I loved.

I do not know if I can find that in this group. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m all 
that desperate; I just have my doubts. Right now, Arina is taking a walk 
through the woods, and I join her. She smiles but keeps silent, and I 
return the favor. We stay there for many of the morning hours, just 
exploring in silence, curious about our boundaries, about who we really 
are and what we&#39;re really doing here. We never say a word during the 
long time we spend together- parting only to satisfy our hunger as the 
catering arrives- but I think I have connected more to her than I have 
to anyone so far. I mean, I like Terra, but she&#39;s kind of two-faced. She 
can be quiet and withdrawn one moment, and- when she was invited to swim 
later on- she jumped right in. She even acted like an animal when we 
gathered around the television to watch video games. She was a whole 
other person and I felt separated from her.

Fausta and Elisa were brilliant riders, but I suppose the rich have that 
sort of time on their hands. Freya and Valencia solidified my theory, 
and I wondered if Alice or Felicity were any good. I had gotten a lot 
better and could nearly race the others, but I, like Elisa and our 
hostess, was content to trot and explore, to listen and to observe, to 
be the woman filling in the background, occasionally looked at and 
referred to, but never a participant. Felicity joined us later and I 
couldn&#39;t help but smile at her. She has always been beautiful, in my 
opinion, but lately she had grown radiant, attractive, and warm. I had 
wondered before whether or not this was the person I could devote myself 
to- whether or not I could love her- I felt giddy just by thinking about 
it. When you&#39;ve led a life of suffering like I have, you get a sixth 
sense about people, about whether or not they&#39;ve shared your pain, if 
you can relate to them or not. I could most definitely relate to 
Felicity. I don&#39;t know what her problems were, but she seems to have 
conquered them, and for that, I envied her.

I knew she was serious about dating me when she asked a third time. The 
first, obviously, I took as a crude joke, since plenty of men (and a 
small number of women) have said the same, only to jerk away at the last 
minute, laughing. Oh, that&#39;s right. I don&#39;t dress like you and I don&#39;t 
talk like you, so it must be funny, eh? I get it. But look: I can&#39;t do 
anything about my wardrobe; besides, these clothes seem to reflect my 
personality. They&#39;re comfortable. And don&#39;t tell me you&#39;d walk away sane 
after hearing that your family&#39;s been obliterated in a Triad gang war. I 
was lucky. I found someone who actually cared. You know how rare that is 
these days? Terra...I think she does care, a lot really, but I can&#39;t see 
the real Her. I know Fleur doesn&#39;t care, even though she&#39;s honest. 
Felicity...

The second time was when we were in the pool together. Elisa had too 
much to drink and was singing with Nadia, while Fausta was going on 
about fashion with Valencia. Shannon was in the hot tub with Kasumi and 
Arina, holding a fairly normal conversation, and I was the only one 
there actually trying to swim. I saw Felicity sail over to me, doing a 
backstroke, borrowing one of Maria Maethers&#39;s outfits. She righted 
herself, smiling, leaning against the side. I decided to take a break 
and studied her. She was recklessly beautiful- and radiant- and I felt 
nervous just being around her. It was sort of like how I felt with 
Freya- and once this thought crossed my mind, I raised my guard and 
crossed my arms. No way was I going to be fooled a second time.

&quot;You having fun?&quot; she asked. I nodded my head. &quot;Good. I&#39;m having a lot 
of fun. This is probably the first time...well, the second since 
yesterday...that I&#39;ve really let myself go, and not been ashamed about 
it. It makes me feel dizzy. Um...so anyway, we didn&#39;t have a lot of time 
to talk yesterday after we left that karaoke place, and I was wondering 
if...well, you know. If you gave what I said any more thought.&quot;

I couldn&#39;t believe that she was actually nervous and stuttering. I know 
I intimidate a few people with my size and strength, but she looked even 
happier than before, like she was actually serious about this, and 
merely unsure of my reaction. Well, I remembered, and to be honest...

&quot;I hav-ven&#39;t given it m-m-much thought,&quot; I muttered. She made me 
dreadfully nervous. That&#39;s all I could force out. O Buddha, why did that 
swimsuit have to cling to her like that?

&quot;Uh, that&#39;s okay,&quot; she said frantically. &quot;I mean, just...if you&#39;re not 
interested, it&#39;s cool. I just thought... Hey, everyone! Look who finally 
decided to come here!&quot; Terra had returned and the girls threw her into 
the pool. I lost Felicity&#39;s attention and decided to get out and dry 
off. I went to the kitchen to finish off more of our catered meal, and 
was joined by Fleur, who was wearing a towel. She gave me a paralyzing 
smile and hunted for something to eat.

&quot;I normally don&#39;t snack, but swimming builds up such an appetite. Ah.&quot; 
She took a single strawberry and savored it like it was a work of art. 
My heart pounded in my chest. I liked Fleur for her beauty and her 
realism, but not for much else. She was good enough to take care of me, 
and I had felt a powerful surge as our lips met, but she was not the 
one. I would much rather be with a poor woman with a good heart than a 
wealthy girl that&#39;s morally bankrupt.

Like I&#39;m one to judge, right?

&quot;You know,&quot; she said, casting her face to glance out the kitchen window, 
&quot;I actually like it here. I&#39;m really enjoying myself. Freya has a good 
maid with her, and Maria&#39;s designs have really given the place some 
character. It&#39;s too bad she&#39;s such a goody two-shoes. Freya&#39;s exactly 
the kind of person I could like. But...ugh. And that cousin of hers! 
What&#39;s with the whole &#39;mommy&#39; charade? It&#39;s really repulsive. I envy you 
a lot,&quot; she stated suddenly, facing me again. I didn&#39;t know what she 
meant by that.

&quot;Wh-what do y-y-you mean?&quot;

&quot;Your family&#39;s all wiped out, aren&#39;t they?&quot; she said flatly. &quot;You&#39;re the 
last one left. That&#39;s what I envy. I wish my family would just go to 
Hell and never come back. Not...not my mother, I mean. She...god, Amy, 
if you tell anybody this, I swear...but I guess you won&#39;t. Heh, I can 
trust you.&quot; Her smile was sharp and sinister; I nodded in agreement. &quot;My 
mother&#39;s the only person I still like in this world. Her and Rain. Well, 
and you, maybe, but only because you don&#39;t talk much. That&#39;s the problem 
with people. But my mother was good, and I wouldn&#39;t want anything bad 
happening to her. Nothing she didn&#39;t deserve, anyway. But my father...&quot; 
She grinned and I stepped back, frightened. How anybody could look like 
that when they mentioned their own parents...

&quot;You know, when I heard he was slaughtered in prison...I said, &#39;That&#39;s 
nice,&#39; and went about my day. You don&#39;t even have a family to mess you 
up. You can still think of them in a positive light, like they really 
were the loving people you saw them as. Very few of us are that lucky, 
Amy. I wish to God my father had died sooner. But it&#39;s probably for the 
best, right? Through all this pain comes clarity, I suppose. You&#39;re just 
not a person until you&#39;ve suffered.&quot; She smiled at me and relinquished 
her towel. I had seen her body before, but not like this, not like this. 
I looked away and she laughed.

&quot;Now I wonder what parental nonsense is making you deny your instincts. 
You&#39;re not looking away because you&#39;re repulsed. You&#39;ve got a 
deontological fear of immorality: you only act good because you&#39;re 
afraid of the consequences. But what would really happen if you followed 
your instincts? Would it be so bad to sleep with me?&quot;

We were touching now. Her hand was on my face. She kissed my mouth and I 
stepped back.

&quot;Y-yes,&quot; I hissed painfully. &quot;I d-d-d-don&#39;t love you.&quot; And I walked away 
before she could tempt me further.

 

Felicity asked me if I had given her offer any more thought on our last 
day, as we went horseback riding together. I took her to a secluded spot 
and said that I would love to go out with her, and together we 
dismounted and spent many quiet hours alone in the forest.
