<h1>Project Angelus (part 7 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>      &quot;The... uh, the ATM doesn&#39;t take my card...&quot; Miki said slowly, trying to gauge 
Eveon&#39;s reaction. They were outside a bank, unfortunately not Miki&#39;s bank, and the ATM 
didn&#39;t take her type of card.

      &quot;Seriously? Can&#39;t we go to a store and just take money out?&quot;

      Miki shook her head. &quot;No, apparently they don&#39;t trust me... I guess we&#39;re suspicious 
since this is a small town.&quot;

      And that&#39;s how the two of them got stuck walking again. &quot;This really sucks. We&#39;re 
totally going to run into more Death Dolls out here!&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;ll be alright... it&#39;s actually harder to fight when you&#39;re with me so if 
something happens again, run off.&quot;

      Eveon just gave her a look. &quot;Really? I impede that much on you?&quot;

      &quot;N-no!&quot; Miki stammered. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean... I just get nervous fighting around you.&quot;

      They had been walking for hours and the sun was starting to set. Eveon looked around, 
not seeing any fiends, so it was a good sign. &quot;Nervous,&quot; she asked after a few minutes.

      &quot;...yeah... I just don&#39;t want you to think I&#39;m weird,&quot; Miki said.

      &quot;Dude, I have a healing flashlight on my hand, we&#39;re being chased by puppets, you can 
explode things and all you can worry about is being weird?&quot;

      Miki was about to reply when she suddenly looked around. &quot;Do you... hear something?&quot;

      Eveon immediately looked up. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a helicopter.&quot;

      &quot;A... helicopter?&quot; Miki looked up and as it came closer, she recognized the logo on 
it. &quot;Looks like the Shadow Organization caught up with us...&quot;

      Before Eveon could react, she was being tugged along. &quot;You know, for a protector, you 
sure do run a lot!&quot;

      Miki just ignored her as the helicopter got close to the open field behind them. She 
cursed at herself for not choosing to walk by the highway.... but... it was either a back 
road and risk getting attacked or the highway and risk getting picked up by the police 
after curfew.

      Eveon turned around to see someone jump out of the helicopter and... fly? &quot;Uh, Miki, 
we have a flying person coming our way.&quot;

      &quot;A what-?!&quot; A flash of energy came their way and ground around them blew up. Miki 
grabbed at Eveon, trying to keep her from getting hit by the flying debris. The force of 
the attack caused them to be blown back and Eveon coughed as dust flew up into the air.

      The blonde sat up and could see the person as the ground cleared. Her wings were made 
of a bright red, vaguely transparent energy that began to dissipate. The woman standing 
before her had light purple hair, an open overcoat and... a very weird tattoo.

      &quot;I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re a bad guy,&quot; Eveon murmured, looking over at Miki. She was 
kneeling on the ground, coughing due to the dust.

      &quot;Sure, you can call me that,&quot; Lilith said. &quot;You&#39;re Eveon?&quot;

      She nodded, not bothering to stand up. If the woman in front of her could throw 
blazing balls of energy while flying out of a helicopter, then she was probably screwed.

      &quot;Good, that makes things easy. You&#39;re going to be a special guest of the Shadow 
Organization.&quot;

      Eveon just gave her a deadpan look. &quot;Awesome. As long as you don&#39;t chain me up in a 
room and stab me with knives, I think we&#39;ll be good.&quot;

      Lilith&#39;s face instantly changed to one of total surprise. &quot;You... you little-! Ugh, 
you&#39;re almost as bad as Eric!&quot;

      Eveon shrugged. &quot;Yo, provocative female villain, do you have a name?&quot;

      &quot;Lilith,&quot; she said simply and then noticed Miki. &quot;And is that girl next to you Miki 
Uramoto?&quot;

      Eveon nodded despite Miki&#39;s attempt to non verbally tell her to shut up.

      &quot;Then, I will have to kill her a second time.&quot; Lilith held up one of her hands and a 
bolt of red energy shot right at them. It was then that she remembered she was supposed to 
take in Eveon alive... hopefully the girl would only be vaguely injured and Miki would take 
most of the blow.

      Lilith watched in shock as the dust cleared to reveal a barrier around the two girls 
and... Eveon&#39;s hand was glowing.

      &quot;I told you not to use that!&quot; Miki shouted at Eveon.

      &quot;I... I didn&#39;t! It just did it on it&#39;s own!&quot;

      &quot;You... you have the Key to God?!&quot; Eveon looked at Lilith&#39;s surprised face. &quot;You have 
it?!&quot;

      &quot;Uh... no,&quot; Eveon said lamely. &quot;It&#39;s... uh... just run of the mill holy power...?&quot;

      Energy began to build up around Lilith. &quot;Looks like I will need to take you in for 
sure, Eveon. And you-&quot; Lilith turned to Miki, throwing more energy at her. &quot;Why don&#39;t you 
just die?!&quot;

      The green eyed girl deftly took out her sword and cut at the energy. It dissipated 
and Miki grabbed Eveon. &quot;Time to go!&quot;

      For the second time that day, Lilith was shocked and completely forgot to get a good 
look at Miki as she turned away. When the helicopter touched down, Lilith was too surprised 
to remember to give chase. Instead, she fumbled with her cell phone to dial Eric about what 
just happened.

      &quot;What do you want?&quot; He answered immediately.

      &quot;I thought Miki wasn&#39;t supposed to be strong,&quot; Lilith fumed.

      &quot;Ah, great... just come back to the lab so we can talk?&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;If she can fly, why isn&#39;t she chasing us?&quot; Eveon asked.

      &quot;Uh... well, she... I don&#39;t know,&quot; Miki responded, just as confused. The two girls 
were hiding in a tree, waiting for the sounds of helicopters to become faint.

      &quot;Do you know her? She seemed dead set on roasting you,&quot; Eveon murmured, looking at 
her hand.

      &quot;I...&quot; Miki trailed off, now worried that Lilith saw her. &quot;Kind of. I kind of know 
her...&quot;

      The blonde obviously didn&#39;t believe her, but changed the subject. &quot;So are we now 
screwed beyond belief since the Seal of Light activated on its own?&quot;

      Miki nodded solemnly. &quot;Yeah, but it seems like they&#39;re already after you. But now 
I... I don&#39;t what&#39;s going to happen to Dark...&quot;

      &quot;To what?&quot; Eveon gave her a confused look. &quot;Dark?&quot;

      &quot;That... that&#39;s the name of the angel they were torturing,&quot; Miki said, leaning 
against the trunk of the tree. &quot;They might... kill her now that she&#39;s no longer any use.&quot;

      Eveon looked down at her hand. &quot;So... I just... caused someone&#39;s death...?&quot;

      &quot;What? No, no that&#39;s not what I... that&#39;s not what I meant at all. It&#39;s the Shadow 
Organization. It&#39;s all their fault.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Whaddya mean she was too strong?&quot;

      Lilith tried to ignore the sounds of Eric slurping on his noodles. She&#39;d just gotten 
back to headquarters to talk to him, only to be told she was interrupting his college style 
instant ramen dinner.

      &quot;It was... it just didn&#39;t make sense.&quot; Lilith twirled a piece of hair with her 
finger. &quot;I mean, she didn&#39;t show any of the power she used to have-

      &quot;Because you stole it?&quot;

      &quot;-she uses a sword-&quot;

      &quot;Change of style?&quot;

      &quot;-and she ran away.&quot;

      Eric took a moment to chew his food and swallow. &quot;Alright. So Miki isn&#39;t in tip top 
shape. I thought you said she was stronger... Hmm, but if she is perfectly healthy and 
without any dangerous power, I would love to have her alive for additional testing...&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re not listening to me! She&#39;s still strong because her sword cancelled out my 
attack!&quot;

      Eric choked on a noodle and started to hack. Lilith rolled her eyes as he groped 
around his desk for his water and chugged it. &quot;Cancelled! How did she do that?!&quot;

      &quot;She just swung. Oh and Eveon has the flipping Key to God, so we need to get her.&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t care about the Key, but Miki cancelled your attack with her sword?&quot; Eric 
went back to eating his noodles, watching Lilith expectantly.

      &quot;Yes! It was a lot like the...&quot; She trailed off and started to massage her temples. 
&quot;It was a lot like the Demon Buster...&quot;

      The professor froze up and started typing in things to his computer. &quot;The Demon 
Buster? I thought so, but it was destroyed when... huh... Miki must have recovered the- Did 
you leave the knife behind?&quot;

      Lilith started to call Adrian. &quot;No, I still have the knife I used to kill her.&quot;

      &quot;Well you obviously didn&#39;t kill-&quot;

      &quot;How was I supposed to know she survived?! I stabbed her and gouged out her insides!&quot; 
She shouted out, energy crackling around her.

      Eric held up his hands defensively. &quot;Just saying...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Man... this really sucks,&quot; Eveon muttered. &quot;I&#39;m hungry...&quot;

      Miki rooted around in her backpack, trying to find something to appease the girl. She 
still felt terribly guilty for kidnapping her, so... she quickly fished out a candy bar and 
handed it over. &quot;Here, I got a bottle of water too, if you get thirsty.&quot;

      &quot;Thanks,&quot; Eveon said, sadly. &quot;You don&#39;t really think they&#39;re going to kill her, do 
you?&quot;

      The green eyed girl shook her head. &quot;No, I mean, she&#39;s an important angel, so it 
might start a war.&quot; Though, she doubted it. Dark was probably dead.

      The blonde unwrapped the candy and broke it in half. &quot;Here,&quot; she said, handing it to 
Miki. &quot;Thanks for taking care of me despite the fact that half the bad guys in the world 
are apparently chasing me.&quot;

      Miki laughed. &quot;No, no... At least Lilith doesn&#39;t want you dead. That&#39;s a bonus - you 
won&#39;t get killed. Besides, no matter what I&#39;ll pro-&quot;

      Just as Miki was going to repeat her token lines, threads came out of nowhere and 
entrapped her. &quot;Wha-? Fiends?!&quot;

      Eveon tried to grab her, but Miki was flung back into a tree as a seal erupted 
beneath her, stopping all movement. Two shadowed figures came down next to her and just as 
Eveon was about to react, she heard:

      &quot;We caught a kidnapper, Big sister!&quot;

      &quot;Hina, don&#39;t shout so loudly in a forest. Big sister is right there.&quot;

      The blonde started to put two and two together, but a hand clamped down on her 
shoulder, causing her to panic and scream. &quot;Relax,&quot; a smooth voice said, grabbing her 
around the waist. &quot;We&#39;re here to help.

      Eveon knew she should have figured it out sooner. Who else would pull off the creepy 
shoulder grab other than... She turned around. &quot;Hoshi? What are you doing here?&quot;

      The silver haired woman chuckled. &quot;We&#39;re here to save you from your kidnapper, of 
course.&quot;

      Hina had her spirit threads tight around Miki and Tsuki was kneeling on the ground, 
keeping her seal active.

      &quot;What? But Miki&#39;s a good guy...! Er, girl, whatever! She&#39;s been helping me,&quot; Eveon 
shouted.

      &quot;Oh. Whoops,&quot; Hina giggled, causing her threads to disappear.

      &quot;Ah... I told you Sakura said she wasn&#39;t harming Eveon,&quot; Tsuki muttered releasing her 
seal.

      Miki proceeded to fall over on to the ground. &quot;...wha...?&quot; The girl was dazed beyond 
belief.

      &quot;Um... these are my friends,&quot; Eveon said shakily, going over to the green eyed girl. 
&quot;They... uh, get pretty serious when it comes to taking out people.&quot;

      Hoshi let out a slight laugh. &quot;Indeed. It&#39;s alright; I&#39;ll carry your friend.&quot;

      Eveon just looked at Hoshi and then back at Miki. It was then that Tsuki said, &quot;Maybe 
I should carry her.&quot;

      Hoshi let out a little bit of a sigh, but maybe it was her own fault for being too 
friendly around pretty girls...
