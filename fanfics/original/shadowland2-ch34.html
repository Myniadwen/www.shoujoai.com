<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch33.html">Back to Part 33</a><pre>The last of the shards of glass passed by Jenn and she cautiously opened 
her eyes to find the washroom had melted away and now she found herself 
sitting upon the floor of the library from her dreams. She scanned the 
room quickly to see a whirlwind of glass circling in the middle of the 
room, making it impossible for Jenn to escape. Jenn could still see the 
distinct shape of May standing amongst the fragments. 

May spread her arms apart and the glass responded to her every movement 
as they swirled around her limbs merely inches from the surface of her 
skin. Suddenly the bits of mirror changed colours and began to look more 
like the glass from stained glass windows then mirrors. The glass 
drifted about until they began to encase May in what appeared to be a 
large stain glassed egg. Abruptly the shards pulled back like a pair of 
giant glass wings revealing a small girl floated a foot above the ground 
with her toes pointed towards the floor. The girl appeared to be about 
twelve or thirteen years old with short curly pink hair and a small blue 
ribbon tied to a lock of hair at one side of her head. The girl&#39;s attire 
comprised of a long sleeved one-piece dress that came down to the girl&#39;s 
knees and a small grey short-sleeved hooded sweater. Jenn thought at 
first that the girl looked rather cute if it wasn&#39;t for those lethal 
glass wings that hovered behind her, each gently striking each other 
creating the sound of an eerie wind chime, a sound that Jenn recalled 
hearing before, but could not remember from where. 

&quot;H... hello?&quot; Jenn mustered a greeting. 
					
The girl simply grimaced at Jenn as if disgusted by the prospect of 
being greeted by Jenn. 

Jenn stood to her feet and brushed the dirt off her skirt, &quot;I&#39;m Jennifer 
North. What&#39;s your name?&quot; Jenn asked politely, trying hard to make 
conversation. 

The girl sprung forwards without warning, her glass wings filled the 
library, slashing bookcases as she flew at Jenn. She crashed into Jenn 
hard and hauled the girl off the ground by the front of her shirt. Jenn 
peered down as the two of them sailed over tables and chairs across the 
library, &quot;I know exactly who you are.&quot; The stained glass angel sneered, 
then slammed Jenn into a bookshelf with enough force to topple the 
entire shelf over causing it to crash against the wall.  

Jenn grunted against the pain that shot through her shoulder from the 
force of the blow. She could feel the edge of a shelf digging into her 
back and tried to ignore the pain, focussing on the girl in front of 
her, &quot;H... how... do you know me?&quot; Jenn stammered feeling uneasy with 
those shimmering glass wings hovering over her head. This had to be 
another of her dreams, there was no other way to explain it, &quot;Who are 
you?&quot; She inquired with as much calmness as she could muster.

&quot;I&#39;m Carey.&quot; The girl hissed, pressing her knees into Jenn&#39;s chest 
causing the girl to scream out in pain, &quot;And you are the one who took my 
sister from me.&quot; She snarled digging her knees into Jenn.

&quot;What?!?&quot; Jenn glanced into the hate-filled eyes, &quot;Y... you can&#39;t 
mean... K... Kris?&quot; She stammered trying to fight the pain. 

&quot;Her name is Aigneis.&quot; Carey reminded Jenn and slammed her against the 
shelves again, a sinister smile playing across the girl&#39;s face, &quot;Sis 
might not have been strong enough to give you to father, but I can.&quot; She 
grabbed one of Jenn&#39;s arms and wrenched it around until Jenn&#39;s wrist was 
facing upwards. A glass feathers broke free from its position and 
lowered itself until it was touching Jenn&#39;s wrist, &quot;It was supposed to 
be so easy.&quot; She explained angrily, &quot;All you have to do is die and 
everything will be back to normal again.&quot; The blade started to cut away 
at Jenn&#39;s bandages, &quot;With you gone we can all be a happy family again, 
but no you had to be a fighter. They always want to live. Why can&#39;t you 
simply die?&quot; She asked no one in particular.

Jenn stared in stunned shock as layer by layer the bandages began to 
fall away until her bare wrist were exposed and the blade began to pick 
away at her stitches, &quot;N... no...&quot; Jenn stammered as she tried to break 
free of the girl&#39;s grasp, however Carey held a great amount of strength 
in her tiny arms. 

&quot;This time I will make sure you stay dead.&quot; Carey giggled insanely, 
&quot;Finally I&#39;ll be rid of you and Father will be proud of me again.&quot;
