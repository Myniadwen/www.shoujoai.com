Chronicle Fifteen - the RE-incarnation of Seraphiel 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The &#39;super-city&#39; Aryahm.

It was the most technologically advanced place on Earth. And the second 
most technologically advanced city in the Ashurian Empire, following 
after the paradise called Meshezabel. If that space city was the heaven 
of earthly advancement, then Aryahm had to be classified as the hell. 
This city was ridden with the bitter product of human stagnation, like a 
fruit gone overly ripe. Some people used to call Aryahm &#39;the child of 
humanity&#39;s demise&#39;. But others didn&#39;t tend to enjoy hearing such a thing 
about the city. Because in most cases it was the one place on Earth 
where the lifestyle of the Sermo age could be enjoyed. This city had the 
needs of anyone born in that era. The access to public computers, paved 
streets constantly run over by wheel-less hover cars, buses, 
skyscrapers, train systems, underground railways. The buildings were 
made of imposing steel polished off and protected by mixtures of 
chemicals to prevent rusting. Three million people lived it its walls. 
Making it the most densely populated city in the world. The only city 
left that could stand against its old Sermo counterparts. Because of its 
stationing on the thin bridge of land between the countries of Northern 
Horan and Areopagus (the remains of Europe) it had a limitless water 
supply which was purified by the many underground waterworks stations. 
To some this was seen as the highest point of mankind&#39;s work in the 
Anthropos Era. Those were the opinions of the Ashurians who had built 
and designed the city to their own specifications.

But to the people who lived on the other side of Aryahm&#39;s spectrum, 
those who were not immediately put into profit by the city&#39;s global 
magnetism and stellar development; life was far different. 

Aryahm was seen as a cage to those people. The steel buildings of pride 
billowed out thick pillars of smoke that hung in the air like shadows. 
Those clouds overhung certain parts of the city so thickly that it 
seemed like night most of the time. Those who had no talents in life, no 
redeeming features, were forced to either join the army and die fighting 
in other lands, or live in the kind of poverty that would have outshined 
the 19th Century of the Sermo period by far. Certain sections of the 
city were specifically designated to the poor. Most townsfolk referred 
to them as Meta Ghettos. The people living inside them were seen to be 
no more than scum; who could only be classed into two categories. Ones 
that wanted to be saved and so worked hard to be elevated in standing, 
or ones that accepted the hopelessness of the situation and indulged 
themselves in the most dulling and lecherous ways possible. The latter 
was more likely than the former. The only lucrative way of life for a 
man living in a Meta Ghetto was to sell drugs or human body parts for 
bio-technological use. The only way for a woman to make good money was 
to prostitute herself, bouncing from brothels to whorehouses. The kind 
of places that Ashurian diplomats in any echelon of the spectrum would 
come to fulfil their sick desires. To forsake either of those strategies 
in life whilst existing in a Meta Ghetto would probably lead to a short 
life. One ended either by murder (most likely by those who would seek 
your bodily organs), sickness (there was no free health care in the Meta 
Ghettos) or of hunger (and there was no steady food supply either). 

This was Aryahm.

It was the grim place that Yumi, Tomoko, Fahlem and Terry now found 
themselves inside of. The four outsiders dressed themselves inside four 
brown cloaks to obscure their bodily features. After what happened at 
the St. Mary&#39;s Base, Fahlem had decided that the Ashurians would have 
put out an profile for each of them. Thankfully Skye had stayed up half 
the night programming fake ID Cards for them to pass through the many 
checkpoints on. Now that the Ragnarok System was back online, getting 
through any checkpoints without an ID Card was virtually impossible 
without force. The four had gathered together at a small steel house on 
the very edge of the city walls. It was an old hideout of Terry&#39;s when 
he had lived in Aryahm before deserting the army. Small in all, but it 
did have the one thing that they needed right now. And that was a 
computer terminal. The Kamiyashiki was hovering about a mile south of 
the city. Fahlem, Tomoko and Terry had taken the same jeep used at St. 
Mary&#39;s to make it this far. Only stopping to enter into the underground 
water pipes that ran in skeleton-like format under the city streets. 
Those pipes were big enough for Meta Suits to walk in. And so Yumi had 
come into the city via the Oriax which was now lying in wait for her in 
the sewers below the Terry&#39;s old hideout.   

After spending a half hour or so at the hideout with Yumi and Tomoko; 
Terry and Fahlem left for the Command Central. That was around twenty 
minutes ago. Though the headquarters of the Schutzenreich was buried in 
the middle of Aryahm, about three miles away from the hideout; there 
were trains that could take them into Command Central&#39;s district at any 
time. By now they were likely to have reached the walls of the base 
itself. Yumi and Tomoko were therefore left alone inside Terry&#39;s 
hideout. And the majority of that time alone was spent in silence. Yumi 
sat by the wooden desk of the computer terminal and busied herself with 
making the preparations necessarily to upload her Counter Demon Wall. 
Tomoko stood at the far wall, looking out through the blackened window 
into the hustle and bustle of the city streets. It was an awkward air 
between them. One that Tomoko resented with a passion. But she knew that 
this silence and awkwardness between the two of them was her own making. 
By kissing Yumi yesterday, Tomoko had changed the nature of their quick 
relationship almost instantaneously. No ignorance could be feigned about 
it. They both knew what this was about. And yet Tomoko was the only one 
of them who was willing to make an effort in fixing it.

&quot;How long are you gonna ignore me?&quot; Tomoko questioned. 

Yumi was typing on the keyboard when she said, &quot;...I&#39;m not.&quot;

&quot;See, that&#39;s one of four things I&#39;ve noticed about you, Yumi. One, 
you&#39;re insecure. Two, you&#39;re fragile. Three, you&#39;re constantly burying 
your head in the sand. And four, you&#39;re a crappy liar.&quot;

&quot;...What... do you want from me?&quot; The Japanese girl asked. 

&quot;Just tell me what&#39;s on your mind,&quot; Tomoko urged, &quot;My God, it was a 
kiss. It&#39;s not like I threw a dagger at your face or something. How hard 
can it be to express your feelings about it?&quot;

Yumi kept on typing. &quot;...I&#39;m... busy right now.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you keep telling yourself that.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you want to find Lune?&quot; Yumi prodded, stopping the actions of her 
hands on the keyboard, &quot;Don&#39;t you think that preventing the Novus Deus 
birth is more important than...&quot;

Tomoko crossed her arms over her chest. &quot;...Than... what? Than what? 
C&#39;mon, speak already, Yumi. I&#39;m not quite as weak-hearted as you seem to 
think. Or maybe you&#39;re just comparing me to yourself.&quot;

&quot;...Just leave it...&quot; Yumi whispered, &quot;...I... can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;What is it, Yumi? What do you want to say to me? Look, if you want me 
to apologize for making you uncomfortable then I&#39;m sorry. Maybe I 
misread the signs. Whatever. I didn&#39;t mean to-&quot;

Yumi lowered her head. &quot;It&#39;s not... that. I like you... Tomoko. I really 
do, I... just met you, but... that&#39;s the way... I...&quot; 

&quot;So then what&#39;s your problem?&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ve never... been like that with someone. At least not... 
willingly. Not in the way that... I always dreamed of. And back in my 
own time there was... someone I cared about. She didn&#39;t feel the same 
way about me... and she betrayed me. That was over 6000 years ago... but 
I still remember it like it was... yesterday. I still have feelings for 
her... and when you kissed me... it was like... for a moment... that... 
I... suppose I could put it all behind me. But as much as I like you, 
Tomoko... I still...&quot;

Tomoko chuckled grimly. &quot;...You&#39;re still hot for this dead chick. 
Right?&quot;

&quot;...&quot; Yumi said nothing in reply to that. But the tension in her eyes 
spoke greatly about what she was thinking. 

&quot;...I get it. You like me but you&#39;re not ready to let go yet. I can deal 
with that. I&#39;m not some little girl anymore. So don&#39;t worry about it. 
It&#39;s fine.&quot;

Yumi looked over at Tomoko. &quot;...You don&#39;t sound fine...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well...&quot; The captain of the Kamiyashiki looked away, &quot;...I&#39;m not 
gonna pretend that I&#39;m not a little disappointed, either.&quot;

Once that was said Yumi turned back to the computer screen. When she did 
she bit her lip with guilt. Tomoko was one of the few positive things 
about the Sermo period. The last thing she wanted to do was hurt her. 
But Yumi couldn&#39;t lie about what she was feeling, either. Chizu Yagata 
had been her first love. It was an unrequited love, certainly, one that 
was centred around a fictional woman, &#39;Chizuru Matsubana&#39;, the disguise 
of Chizu. But that didn&#39;t make it any less real in Yumi&#39;s heart and 
mind. And those feelings couldn&#39;t just vanish overnight. Even though 
Chizu had died thousands of years ago, Yumi&#39;s memories of those times 
were clear as rock. Therefore it was impossible to simply cast aside 
everything and just start something new with Tomoko. No matter how much 
either of them wanted it. But the former Eros couldn&#39;t think of that 
now. And she knew that she had to concentrate on the task at hand. 
Finding out Lune&#39;s location. Once the computer was online and Yumi had 
access to the A.M.N (Aryahm Military Network) she went to work. First 
she slotted the disk with the Counter Demon Wall program into the 
CD-Drive and activated it from the onset. Instantly her fingers touched 
the keyboard again and Yumi opened a screen which led to Central Data 
Banks of Metatron. With the Counter Demon Wall in play, the Security 
Demons of the Aryahm Military Network could not pick up on her 
incursion. And more importantly, it blocked the Ragnarok System&#39;s own 
Security Demons for a three minute period. Yumi soon hacked her way 
through the system, using her software to surpass the many firewalls 
blocking intrusion. Until finally she was able to observe the now 
lesser-protected files of Aryahm Military, those inside of the Central 
Data Banks of the Aryahm super-computer, Metatron.

Tomoko walked up to Yumi and rested an elbow on her chair. &quot;How much 
time do you have left.&quot;

Yumi&#39;s fingers tapped the keys as fast as possible without error. &quot;At 
least a minute and a half. That&#39;s plenty of time.&quot;

And so it was. It took a lot of scrolling and code-breaking in such a 
short period, but eventually Yumi found a data file that had been 
uploaded into the Central Data Banks more than six hours ago. One that 
spoke of the details of Lune&#39;s personal details, capture, re-capture, as 
well as her current location inside of Command Central. 

Tomoko peered over Yumi&#39;s shoulder and saw;

NAME: LUNE WHITE - THE  EROS - 
AGE: 17 YEARS, 11 MONTHS
SEX: FEMALE 
RACE: EROS/HUMANOID 
HEIGHT: 5&#39;9&quot;
WEIGHT: 145 LBS 
PLACE OF BIRTH: THE ISLANDS OF BAAN
DATE OF BIRTH: UNKNOWN

BIO-RHYTHM: 69-3
PSYCHO BORDERS: UNKNOWN 
QI-LEVEL (UNSYNCHRONISED): 1,340
QI-LEVEL (SYNCHRONISED): UNKNOWN 

WEAPON CAPABILITIES: NONE
TRAINING: NONE
FAMILY MEMBERS: DECEASED 
HOLDING POINT: CELL 19, BLOCK 2-F, CONTROL CENTRAL

Yumi smiled a little at that. &quot;...Cell 19, Block 2-F. That&#39;s where they 
are holding Lune. Now we just need to get this information to Terry and 
Doctor Fahlem.&quot;

&quot;Gotcha,&quot; Tomoko tapped a button on the earmuff-sized receiver over her 
left ear, &quot;Hey. Terry? Are you reading this?&quot;

A muffled, static-ridden voice replied into Tomoko&#39;s ear through that 
same receiver. &quot;...I... hear... you... boss... speak... up...&quot;

&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll keep this brief. Lune is locked up inside Cell number 
nineteen of something called Block 2-F. You got that?&quot;

&quot;...Got... ya...&quot;

Tomoko nodded with a sigh of relief. &quot;...Okay. Over and out.&quot;

With that, Yumi quickly logged out of the Central Data Banks as well as 
the Aryahm Military Network. The Counter Demon Wall&#39;s range of effect 
was now void. The white-haired teen stood up from the desk of Terry&#39;s 
hideout and turned to Tomoko.

&quot;You should leave now,&quot; Yumi said, &quot;...I&#39;ll have to cause a distraction 
at the frontal walls of Command Central to give the others enough cover 
to find Lune.&quot;

Tomoko removed the receiver from her ear. &quot;...I&#39;m not... gonna start 
being all romantic and fearful now... but... just be careful, okay?&quot;

Yumi nodded. &quot;...I will. You should return to the Kamiyashiki now. That 
way you won&#39;t be caught up in the battle. I&#39;ll see you later, Tomoko.&quot;

And she wasted no time in leaving after that. Yumi jogged out of the 
small metal home and outside, leaving Tomoko to ruminate with her 
thoughts. The hacker ran around the building and over to a trapdoor 
fixed into the strong ground. The same one she had come up from. Yumi 
strained and lifted the trap door upwards, giving her access into the 
waterways again. While Yumi was doing that, Tomoko ran outside and 
jumped into the driving seat of the jeep. She quickly fixed her key into 
the ignition and revved up her transport, its engine chugging with life. 
Tomoko pressed her foot into the accelerator gave a turn of the wheel, 
switching gears. The jeep drove out into the main road, cutting into the 
down moving traffic. Then when she started driving back towards the city 
limits, Tomoko heard a huge rumbling sound. One follow by a gigantic 
eruption to stone and fire. The Oriax burst from the street floor, 
tossing cars away and provoking the many sounds of crushed steel, broken 
glass, rumbling stone and tooting car horns. The gigantic Meta Suit 
leered over the smaller buildings below it, with the Kaiser Halberd 
locked within the grip of its left hand. Soon enough the Oriax took 
flight, bursting into the smog-like air of Aryahm and darting towards 
the city centre. That suit would provide one hell of a distraction.

...Though it didn&#39;t stop Tomoko from worrying as she drove away in the 
opposite direction. &quot;...Please be careful... Yumi.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Cell 16, Block 1-F.

One of many sections and cells inside of the building known as Command 
Central. And it was also the cell that this generation&#39;s Eros, Lune 
White, was now residing. It was much like her old cell inside the South 
Shidou Investigative Research Department. It was very small, boxed in, 
and had absolutely no windows. The cell contained only the minimum 
things needed for a prisoner. A wash basin, a toilet and a lumpy bed. 
Lune sat on top of that bed with her hands still bound together by 
handcuffs. Her legs were drawn up into her chest and she wrapped her 
arms around them as best she could with the handcuffs on. Lune&#39;s head 
lulled into the egg-like shape she had position she had put herself 
into. Though she did not feel very comfortable or happy here, she could 
at least calm herself in fact that she was not being treated with any 
violence. Even the seemingly violent Aratia de Toscana had been 
considerate of Lune to a certain extent. And Lune found herself thinking 
of her. Aratia seemed so close-hearted and yet so wild, in a strange 
sort of way. But Lune could see through that shell. It was one of the 
reasons she felt herself to be so calm in a situation like this. Though 
the effect that meeting Aratia had was not planned for her. 

The third member of the Shinjinkai had delivered her to this place in 
the early morning. Once they arrived in Command Central Lune was given 
to the care of guards. Those guards were the same ones who brought here 
down to this cell. And Lune had been waiting here ever since. The Eros 
did not know why she was part of this whole affair, she didn&#39;t know why 
she was in captivity. But being in these conditions for most of her life 
gave her a sort of half-jaded, half-subservient ease in accepting them. 
This had been Lune&#39;s life for so long... it was only natural for her to 
cope this well. 

Then while she found herself thinking of Aratia, the door to the right 
of Lune started to open. It shifted to one side and a female scientist 
walked in. She was flanked by around three guards but they remained 
outside. When the automatic door closed once more behind her, the woman 
spoke.

&quot;Lune White? That&#39;s your name, is it not?&quot;

Lune gave a small nod. &quot;Yes. That&#39;s me. Who... are you?&quot;

&quot;My name is Diana Magnus Katrianna,&quot; She replied, &quot;I am the leader of a 
scientific team called the Ministry of Metaphysical and Biotechnological 
Neo-Eugenic Research. We operate out of Aryahm, the city you are now in. 
I am honoured to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Honoured to meet me?&quot; Lune wondered. 

Diana smiled that cold smile of hers. &quot;Yes. You may or may not realize 
it but you are a very important person to us. You have a power inside 
you that escapes even me. But your role is a great deal more 
imperative...&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;I suppose no one has gone out of their way to explain your 
significance. So would you like me to tell you this myself?&quot; Asked the 
Katrianna woman. 

Lune bobbed her head again as a silent yes. Diana pushed her glasses up 
the bridge of her nose and said, &quot;Around 12,000 years ago an organism 
descended to the world from space. We call it Novus Deus and my 
superiors think of it as a god. This god gave birth to a new organism 
which soon divided itself to become the ancestors of human beings. Then 
a certain woman did something. She tried to take all information to 
herself. In a way this act brought about the death of the god that came 
from space. And when that god died it split itself asunder. The two 
halves of that god became humans. Those two people and all of their 
descendants are called Eros and Thanatos. Roughly every century and a 
half they have to &#39;sleep&#39; together and give birth to a child. That child 
will be the new god. Until now none of the Eros and Thanatos throughout 
history have been able to produce a child worthy enough for that. But 
you are different. You are an Eros. One which is pure. One that shall 
truly give birth to the new Novus Deus.&quot;

Lune&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;...Eros... God...?&quot;

&quot;You will probably take all of this in as a shock. But I assure you, I 
speak the truth. I understand that recently you have met a girl named 
Yumi. Yumi Mishima? She was once an Eros. She was the one fated by 
destiny to produce a Novus Deus. But because we interfered in that 
process, destiny was re-written. So now the duty falls to you. Although 
we are interfering once again... there is no doubt that you shall spawn 
a new god.&quot;

Lune looked away. &quot;...I don&#39;t... understand...&quot;

&quot;I will not expect you to,&quot; Diana stated, &quot;you have been poorly educated 
by the operatives at the South Shidou Investigative Research Station. I 
blame myself for this. Because I know that I should have taken you into 
my own care to properly prepare you for your fated task. But such a 
thing is normally held to scorn by our... superiors. The father of Yumi 
Mishima was killed because of that same desire.&quot;

&quot;Why are you doing this?&quot; Asked the Eros, &quot;This is wrong.&quot;

Diana widened her smile. &quot;...Yes. For man to interfere in the wheels of 
time and fate is probably the mark of our own impurity. But we are no 
more than the guides to the future. Whether we interceded or not, it 
would have made no great difference to your destiny. You WILL give birth 
to the Novus Deus. There is simply no avoiding it.&quot;

&quot;Is this... what you&#39;ve locked me up for?&quot;

&quot;Yes. This is your one and only use,&quot; Claimed Diana, &quot;to give birth to a 
so-called god. You should know however that your friends are making 
moves to rescue you.&quot;

Lune blinked. &quot;Yumi and the others?&quot;

&quot;Yes. They will be here soon. That girl, Yumi Mishima... she will play 
her role to its fullest today. And thus stage five of my plans now 
begins...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;So. Once again the Shinjinkai are together...&quot;

Aratia, Ryoufei, and Onaba, the three greatest Meta Suit pilots of the 
military behemoth that was known as the Schutzenreich; stood together in 
a circle with their right fists outstretched. The three shades of their 
skin colour reflected their ethnicity. And their action showed off their 
unity. Of all the military divisions that worked on the Earth Sphere, 
Meta Suit-based ones were always the most feared. And the most feared 
team of pilots in terms of Meta Suits had to be the Shinjinkai. They 
were known the world over for their success in battle; be it through 
conquest of a country or the suppression of rebels in the Ashurian 
Empire. And their conceited attitude towards themselves showed that same 
thing.

The room that they were in was their personal room. One for recreational 
purposes while working in Aryahm. It was no more than usual in design. 
The tall metal pillars that supported ceiling were framed with pictures 
and wall scrolls, as were the walls. It had a computer terminal, a 
television set, a separate bathroom with a built-in Jacuzzi, bright 
carpeting and mounted on the walls alongside certain pictures were old 
relic weapons, like muskets and bayonets from the Sermo era. This was 
the place that the Shinjinkai came to relax in as a unit. 

Aratia, Ryoufei, and Onaba stepped back from their circle of form and 
relaxed. Aratia plopped down on the black leather couch and spread her 
arms out, crossing one of her legs over the other. Ryoufei went over to 
a small side bar and removed three crystalline glasses. He took out a 
bottle of champagne (made in North Horan) and poured some of it into 
those three glasses. He then put the bottle down and took the glasses 
over to Onaba and Aratia. Each member of the Shinjinkai took a glass and 
held it up in unison, each of them stating;

&quot;For the grace of unity, the eternal prosperity of the Ashurian Empire 
and for the completion we seek in the eyes of our sovereign, Queen 
Ashura, the Shinjinkai shall arise to do down all those who would stand 
in the way of God&#39;s will.&quot;

Aratia took a sip of her wine. &quot;...It&#39;s nice to see this place hasn&#39;t 
changed. The St. Mary&#39;s Base was abysmal. Not to mention that facility 
in South Shidou. Finally I feel like I can unwind...&quot;

&quot;I heard that a rebel soldier attacked the St. Mary&#39;s Base.&quot; Onaba said.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; The blonde woman confirmed, &quot;I think it&#39;s that same guy who 
Commander K&#148;hler&#39;s grandson ran off with. I thought that both of them 
would have been dead by now, but... I suppose one of them still lives.&quot;

&quot;And did you take care of him, Aratia?&quot; Ryoufei drank some wine before 
continuing, &quot;Rats should die before they have a chance to breed.&quot;

Aratia frowned. &quot;Meh. I downed his suit, but that was all. I should have 
finished him off but once I figured out where that Lune White girl was I 
had to re-capture her, the little bitch. What does the Council 
Electorate even want with her?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not for us to say,&quot; Onaba mumbled, &quot;we only need to think of our 
orders. So what did you see of that suit? That Oriax? I have been told 
that the one known as Yumi Mishima now has it in her possession.&quot;

Aratia again scowled. &quot;That old hunk of junk? It was-&quot;

And once again Aratia found herself cut off by an alarm. One that was 
quite familiar to her. &quot;Warning. This base is under attack. All members 
of the Shinjinkai please proceed to the Meta Suit hanger.  Warning. This 
base is under attack. All members of the Shinjinkai please proceed to 
the Meta Suit hanger. Warning. This base is under attack. All members of 
the Shinjinkai please proceed to the Meta Suit hanger. Warning. This 
base is under attack. All members of the Shinjinkai please proceed to 
the Meta Suit hanger.&quot;

Aratia, Onaba and Ryoufei stood up in shock at the siren. Something was 
attacking the base?

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The siren&#39;s red flash went off. And the chant that came from the 
speakers was loud enough to fill the corridors of Command Central. Two 
people happened to be running down a specific corridor of Block 2-F. 
Those ones were Doctor Geist Fahlem and Terry Hennig. The two ran down 
the hallway with the echo of their footsteps drowned out by the repeated 
mantra of the siren. 

&quot;Warning. This base is under attack. All members of the Shinjinkai 
please proceed to the Meta Suit hanger.  Warning. This base is under 
attack. All members of the Shinjinkai please proceed to the Meta Suit 
hanger.&quot;

They turned a corner in the middle of their run and came into another 
section of Block 2-F. Yumi&#39;s distraction outside was causing more than a 
lot of damage up above. The shockwaves of which could be felt even here. 
Their current position was at the furthest end of the base, towards the 
northern point of its cross-like shape. Skye had downloaded the layout 
of the base thanks to the Counter Demon Wall programs that Yumi had 
created. So he was able to give Terry and Fahlem a new understanding of 
the current arrangement of the structure. Which was a good thing because 
the design of Command Central had changed a lot since Terry had last 
been there. Much to his own surprise. When the pair of them ran down the 
corridor which was lined with doors to cells on this block, four guards 
were standing in their way just a short distance down. 

Guard #2 piped up. &quot;Intruders! Stop!&quot;

As they ran, Terry and Fahlem nodded to each other to signify their 
response to this little development. They rushed at the guards at a 
faster rate and readied themselves. Fahlem unsheathed his katana from 
its sheath in his stride and slashed at Guard #4. The blade hacked 
through the black armour-clothing and cut into the younger man stomach. 
He gargled on his own blood and dropped to the ground, while Fahlem 
turned to Guard #3 and performed a single half-moon cut. One that 
slashed through the guarded shoulder and into the nerve centre of the 
lungs. He choked on his own blood while falling down, his blood and 
muscle staining Fahlem&#39;s sword. Terry flung himself straight at Guard #2 
with a powerful punch to the face. With all his muscle-enhanced strength 
Terry&#39;s punch cracked the plastic-glass of the guard&#39;s helmet and rammed 
into the nose. Blood gushed from it and screams rent the air. Guard #2 
slouched to the ground whimpering and coughing. Then Terry threw one of 
his lethal kicks into the stomach of Guard #1 and winded the taller man 
effortlessly. His body skidded backwards and slammed into the wall from 
the force, creating a shallow crater mark in it. 

With the guards defeated, Fahlem wiped the blood from his sword and 
sheathed it. &quot;We need to keep moving.&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot;

They continued the run down the corridors and corners towards the cell 
that would be holding Lune. Eventually they reached the one that Tomoko 
and Yumi had told them of. Cell 19. Both fighters stopped and caught 
their breath when they finally reached Lune&#39;s cell. Fahlem acted 
wordlessly and pressed his palm against the computerized control panel 
that secured the lock on the automatic door. He closed his eyes and 
focused his energies, his improved Ishtar Qi, and then concentrated that 
same energy through the panel in a compressed burst. The plastic of the 
panel imploded. And a small wisp of smoke rose from it. With the control 
panel shorted out, the automatic door opened. Fahlem and Terry quickly 
rushed into the room to rescue Lune. But when they entered the room was 
pitch black. Then suddenly the door became active and shut closed again, 
locking them inside this dark room, which was obviously bigger than a 
basic holding chamber. 

&quot;What the hell&#39;s going on?!&quot; Terry shouted, &quot;Lune, are you here?!&quot;

The lights suddenly flashed on. And the true layout of the room was 
shone to both Terry and Fahlem. It was a composed laboratory. The white 
walls, the three heavily-wired computers, and the tables mounted with 
beakers full of chemicals, tripods, design sketches and data statistics 
all indicated to it. The east wall of the lab was concealed by a long 
black veil with the phrase &#39;into the next millennium&#39; stitched on it. 
Then a familiar woman walked into view from the right.

Diana Katrianna.

&quot;You won&#39;t find her here,&quot; She said, &quot;This is Cell 19 of Block 2-F. The 
one you are looking for is in Cell 16 of Block 1-F.&quot;

Terry grit his teeth. &quot;Damnit. Did Yumi get the wrong information?&quot;

Diana smiled at him. &quot;Oh, she thought it to be accurate, alright. But 
you see I changed the records pertaining to Lune&#39;s location in the 
Central Data Banks of Metatron. Just to lead you here. I thought it 
might be more of a convenience for me to keep the Eros out of your hands 
for now. I cannot be sure of the steps you will take in order to assure 
the prevention of the birth of the Novus Deus.&quot;

&quot;You set us up?!&quot; Questioned Terry.

&quot;Not quite, TH-C4. Not quite.&quot; 

Terry&#39;s face twisted with a scowl when Diana referred to him as &#39;TH-C4&#39;, 
not knowing what she meant by that. But Fahlem was the one with the most 
immediate question. &quot;Diana. I know that you are planning something with 
the Oriax and the Novus Deus. What are you up to? What are you trying to 
accomplish?&quot;

Diana lowered her cold smile and turned her head to the side. When she 
did she found herself staring at a table. Not so much the table but the 
thing that was on it. The scientist strode up to the table and picked up 
something on it. A framed photograph of herself by a cabin in a forest. 
Standing next to her in that picture was a slightly older male and a 
young girl. Diana stared at it warmly.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it funny how well our most treasured memories engrave themselves 
to our minds? Human beings spend years pursuing trivial happiness by the 
aid of money... yet when we all look back upon our memories... the ones 
that mean the most to us... such worldly possessions seem... almost 
insignificant. For some people letting go of those memories is just...  
far too hard a feat. And so we dance upon the prospect of reclaiming the 
times at which such memories were realities. Such greed forces us to 
make choices that we would have thought better of beforehand... but that 
ever remains to keep moving. That is how the human animal exists today. 
With the distant spectre of our glorious past hanging over us like a 
shadow... a constant reminder of the life that was denied to us as a 
result of that same kind of greed. That alone is the proof of our 
unworthiness. And yet I will tap into that same greed to obtain my 
happiness. And those who provide me with such... the seeds of my 
memories.&quot;

Fahlem narrowed his eyes. &quot;What are you getting at?&quot;

&quot;...Doctor Fahlem,&quot; Diana brought down the picture, &quot;...you and I have 
known each other for quite a while. Could you truly have forgotten the 
reason I am still alive? As well as mistake the very impetus for my 
ambitions?&quot;

The older man still couldn&#39;t see what she was talking about. &quot;...What 
are your plans, Diana? Why are you doing all this?&quot;

Diana put down the picture and got a grip on herself. &quot;...My truest will 
is no more than resurrection of my daughter Rachel and my husband John.&quot;

&quot;...Now I see...&quot; It was entering Fahlem&#39;s mind, &quot;so THAT was why you 
had the Oriax excavated. You are planning on provoking the 
re-incarnation ahead of schedule, is that it?&quot;

Diana resumed her indifferent smile. &quot;So you have finally figured it 
out. And now you know my reasons. I was once a Protocolian scientist 
named Emma James. These were the days before I was a scientist of such 
high standing, the days of Sermo, 6000 years ago. From my earliest days 
I had been fascinated by nano-technology. And I devoted myself so wholly 
to the subject that I became no more than a shy introvert. Until he 
came... John... my husband and still to this day, my only love. In 
meeting him I began to understand my folly and he brought me out of the 
cage I had unknowingly created for myself. So when I found myself 
pregnant with his child, you could not imagine the pride that I felt. To 
be starting a family with the man I love and the daughter I would 
cherish eternally. It was the beginning of the happiest period of my 
life. The point at which my most beloved memories were formed. But all 
periods of happiness and peace are followed by equally tragic ones. And 
so it was for us. You see my husband was an archaeologist. Whilst 
conducting a dig on some underground ruins in the former Nigeria, he 
uncovered an ancient parchment. That parchment was the Scroll of Sariel. 
It spoke of a creature with tremendous power. One that would supposedly 
&#39;extract the power of sin&#39; and kill God. When the discovery of thus 
scroll was leaked to Protocol, they ordered my John to destroy it. To 
erase its existence. He refused, knowing that this was far too 
significant of a discovery for him to just abandon. So in a fit of 
retaliation, the Protocolians murdered my daughter.&quot;

Fahlem&#39;s eyes saddened. &quot;...Diana...&quot;

&quot;There was no mercy,&quot; Uttered the cold scientist, &quot;an eight-year-old 
with absolutely no connection to the scenario whatsoever was slaughtered 
like an animal. Rachel&#39;s arms were broken from their sockets. Her eyes 
were gouged out. Her stomach had been sliced open and her heart was 
removed from her ribcage. And that heart was mailed to John as a 
declaration of intent. My perfect world crashed around my eyes. Never 
before had I seen or heard of such brutality. And my heartbreak was 
added to when two of my husband&#39;s partners had discovered that John hung 
himself from grief. From then on I devoted myself fully to my research. 
I made a copy of the Scroll of Sariel and then burned the original, to 
appease the Protocolian leaders. Then began work on my only goal in 
life. The restoration of my family. My original plan was to create clone 
bodies for both Rachel and John. However John possessed a rare 
blood-group that could not be melded with animal DNA to produce a clone. 
Therefore the same applied to Rachel, despite the attenuation of that 
aspect of her blood thanks to my own. When I learned that I gave up all 
hope. Until I re-read the Scroll of Sariel. It spoke of Seraphiel. It 
was destined to re-incarnate itself to the world. And the one behind 
that act would be granted with any wish within the parameters of 
Seraphiel&#39;s power. The resurrection of my family shall be that wish.&quot;

&quot;Diana!&quot; Fahlem yelled, &quot;There is FAR more to that &#39;wish&#39; than that! You 
do not understand!&quot;

Diana crossed her arms. &quot;Oh I believe I do. The time has finally come. 
The TRUE God of this planet shall rise up from the imprisonment that you 
placed up it, Doctor Fahlem. And when it does... Rachel and John shall 
be returned to me. My memories will become reality.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re wrong, Diana,&quot; Fahlem suggested, &quot;Seraphiel will not see the 
light of day. I swore to my people that that would not happen. And Yumi 
will not use Transmutation.&quot;

&quot;She will not have a choice in the matter,&quot; Diana affirmed, &quot;not when HE 
arrives.&quot;

Fahlem&#39;s eyes enlarged. &quot;You mean Deathcatcher...?&quot;

Diana nodded to the doctor. &quot;He is already on his way. And when the 
Angel of Death descends upon Aryahm it will begin. My 6000-year wish 
shall be realized.&quot;

Terry was confused about all this. But no more so than what she had said 
of the time at which her story took place. &quot;Wait a minute! 6000 years 
ago? I know that Yumi was preserved and that Fahlem&#39;s an Ishtar. But how 
the hell did YOU survive for that long?&quot;

&quot;Sharp as a tack,&quot; Diana commented, &quot;at least for a soldier. Let me show 
you this... method.&quot;

The brown-haired woman walked over to the black veil that was covering 
the far wall. She grabbed a hold of a rope that dangled from it. Then 
pulled that rope down. Revealing what behind it. Fahlem and Terry both 
gasped when they saw a huge tank of life-sustaining liquid. And inside 
that liquid were more then twenty naked bodies, floating in stasis. And 
all of those bodies were exactly identical to Diana. From the brown hair 
to the green eyes, and from the pale skin to the rosy pink lips. Every 
single one of those lifeless bodies was an exact replica of the current 
Diana. 

&quot;...These are all my fruits of immortality,&quot; Diana said, &quot;after the 
Divine Cataclysm, Emma James went into seclusion and prepared herself 
for the coming resurrection of Seraphiel. She soon changed her name to 
&#39;Diana Katrianna&#39; and realized that the resurrection would come long 
after her death. So she made clones of herself. Hundreds of them. Each 
one lacking a mind of its own. Diana then made a digitised copy of her 
own memories and placed them inside a nano-size chip. And when her body 
began to deteriorate she freed one of her clones and implanted a copy of 
that chip into their brains. That process was replicated over and over 
again to maintain the woman that is both Diana Katrianna and Emma James 
to this day. That is my fate. I am the 783rd clone of Diana Katrianna. 
And I will be the one to see the rebirth of both Seraphiel and my 
family.&quot;

Terry was stunned. &quot;...Oh... my... God...&quot;

&quot;...Why are you so surprised, TH-C4?&quot; Asked Diana, &quot;Oh that&#39;s right. You 
have no understanding of your true nature, have you?&quot;

&quot;What does that mean? Why do you keep calling me TH-C4?&quot;

Diana smirked. &quot;...Have you ever wondered about your REAL origins? I 
think you will be most interested to know...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Bits of destroyed Meta Suits now lay in the streets surrounding Command 
Central, the very heart of the dark city of Aryahm. Smoke and flame rose 
from those pieces. And the people nearby either stared in horror or ran 
away in fear as more of those pieces starting falling down on the area 
from above. Each of those Meta Suit parts were the remains of those 
wiped out by the Oriax. And the Oriax was now hovering high over the 
city, before Command Central itself. The front walls of the compound had 
been smashed through. The twenty-metre thick wall was nothing to the 
Oriax and it had taken its wrath down on the building itself. Over 85% 
of the lower point of Command Central had been obliterated already. 
Flames roared from the points of destruction. And jagged, loose rubble 
littered the stone grounds around them. The steel buildings that were 
built around the layout of Command Central was glowing from the 
illumination that was provided by those flames. And the smoke from them 
joined the smoke that came from the chimneys of the Meta Ghettos. 

The Oriax floated above as three Stolas Marionettes came charging its 
way. They were much like the Baals from Yumi&#39;s time period. But 
different in that they were larger and bulkier. The hide legs of the 
Stolas Marionettes were thick and fully formed into thrusters, forgoing 
the shape of feet. On their shoulders were large beam cannons that could 
only be mounted in that position. And just like the Baals of the Sermo 
era, this machines were unmanned. The three Stolas types flew up from 
one of the ground-level hangers of Command Central, towards the Oriax. 
Yumi&#39;s Meta Suit pulled up the Kaiser Halberd and activated its 
Disruptor Expansion Sword Mode (D.E.S.M). The hub-shaped covering over 
the front of the blade slid back all the way to reveal the full length 
of the blade. And now that the Elohim Program was running in full unison 
with the Soul Gear Engine of the Oriax, it could harness the magnified 
power of Yumi&#39;s Qi. The long blade of the Kaiser Halberd started to 
crackle and sizzle with bright emerald Qi force. The Oriax jetted 
downwards on its thrusters to meet with Stolas #1 with the charged 
Kaiser Halberd in hand. With a two-handed grip it slashed through the 
steel body of the Marionette, chopping it into two, flying through the 
flames of the following explosion. The Oriax performed a second slash on 
Stolas #2, one that cut through the machine just as easily as it did 
with the first. The Oriax zoomed back from the flames of that and 
lowered the Kaiser Halberd. When the final Stolas chased it upwards, the 
Oriax opened its free palm, its left, and the metal in its parted to 
unleash it Gatlings. A hail of bullets were fired on Stolas #3. Each one 
buried itself inside the light brown armour and the process was repeated 
until it blew up. With the destruction of Stolas #3, the Oriax retracted 
its Gatling and clenched a fist.

Yumi, inside the watery dimensional cockpit, sighed. She didn&#39;t like 
killing and fighting anymore than she had done before. But her new 
powers as an Ishtar at least removed her fear of it. &quot;The Kaiser Halberd 
is charged to 65% of its maximum power in the Disruptor Expansion Sword 
Mode. I can&#39;t use the Disruptor Rail Gun here because it might harm too 
many people if I do... but this should be enough to see me through for 
at least another three hours. But I&#39;ll fight for as long as it takes to 
save Lune.&quot;

Then a separate doorway into a Meta Suit hanger of Command Central  
parted for the release of three Meta Suits. This was the suit hanger of 
the Shinjinkai. One of the suits to fly out was the black-armoured 
Hanuman.  The Meta Suit that belonged to Aratia de Toscana. The second 
and third were identical to the Hanuman aside from the colour of their 
armour.  The second suit was the green and white-armoured Fafnir 
(piloted by Onaba) and the blue-armoured Sabnock (piloted by Ryoufei). 
All three Meta Suits of the Shinjinkai flew up to the same air level as 
the Oriax and squared off with it. 

Yumi mused when she saw them. &quot;...Hmm. Those three suits... I know that 
black one from the St. Mary&#39;s Base. But the other two... it&#39;s weird. In 
some ways they look just like the old Bishamon did.&quot;

Ryoufei smirked from his cockpit. &quot;...Is this the 6000-year old beast we 
were warned of? That outdated relic?&quot;

&quot;...No matter,&quot; Onaba said from his Fafnir, &quot;we shall destroy it.&quot;

Aratia giggled devilishly. &quot;Heh, heh, heh! You got that right, Onaba! 
Lets show this bitch why the Shinjinkai is the most feared team EVER!&quot;

The Hanuman, the Fafnir and the Sabnock all split off thereafter. The 
three suits manipulated the Bishamon-style thrusters and moved 
themselves into a triangular position that surrounded the Oriax. With 
the Hanuman to its front, the Fafnir to its rear left and the Sabnock to 
its rear right. They all pulled back their weapons and gathered energy 
into them from their Qi Generators. The Energy Naginata of the Hanuman 
glowed a bright blue. The Energy Broadsword of the Sabnock shone a deep 
yellow. And finally the Energy Axe of the Fafnir brimmed with a fiery 
orange. Their Qi-addled weapons reached their maximum charge and all 
three Meta Suits slashed at the Oriax in the centre of their attack 
pattern, conjuring the kinetic force and raw Qi into projectile-like 
Long Range Slashes. The Oriax was knocked forwards with power by the 
first blow. Then knocked back by the second. And struck forward again by 
the third. Each one did a bit of damage, albeit small. The Oriax 
instantly raised its free arm and aimed in the direction of the Hanuman. 
Its palm opened and its Palm Gatlings shot out another chain of rapid 
fire bullets. The Hanuman vaulted up with its thrusters and darted above 
the bullet fire. Not a single one landed. Then from behind the Oriax 
came the Sabnock. Its clunky Japanese-armoured shoulder rammed into the 
back of the Oriax and forced it forwards again. Fafnir then flew in 
swiftly landed a punishing blow to the head of Yumi&#39;s mecha with its 
Energy Axe. The Oriax flew downwards and steadied itself. Then the three 
Shinjinkai suits re-assumed their previous formation. 

Aratia chuckled. &quot;Oh man! What did I tell that Katrianna bitch? It&#39;s 
just an old piece of junk! I can&#39;t believe I unleashed my Hanuman on 
something this pathetic!&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Onaba sneered, &quot;Maybe I over-estimated it...?&quot;

&quot;There is no longer a need for that. Now we can just dispose of it and 
take the judgment of those arrogant scientific white-coats down a peg or 
two.&quot; Claimed Ryoufei. 

In the cockpit of her Oriax, Yumi wiped the blood that dripped from her 
skull. She forgot that any damage that the Oriax suffers, she would 
suffer too. &quot;...I can&#39;t allow myself to be defeated here. I&#39;ll have to 
fight seriously from now on. Or Lune and the others will be in 
danger...&quot;

The three Meta Suits of the Shinjinkai started to gather up the energy 
necessary to perform their Triangular Formation Long Range Slash Combo 
against the Oriax again. The sizzling of their weapons returned to the 
fold and they prepared themselves. The Oriax flapped its long feathered 
wings backwards and awaited the attack. This time Yumi was prepared 
herself. The first Long Range Slash came from the Sabnock. The Oriax 
used split second speed and soared upwards by both its wings and its 
thrusters. Then it sped ahead on that same speed. With the Kaiser 
Halberd at the ready it performed a following slash to counter the 
previous one. That slash cut off the head of the Sabnock. Then the Meta 
Suit exploded, blowing its pilot Ryoufei into oblivion. 

&quot;R-Ryoufei...&quot; Aratia was stunned, &quot;YOU BITCH!&quot;

The Oriax flew back on its wings and fired its Gatling Palm at the 
Fafnir. It was an action that came so fast the Fafnir couldn&#39;t defend 
against it by mounting a Qi Barrier. The armoured machine&#39;s Energy Axe 
was knocked from its fist quickly. Then Yumi&#39;s mecha flew forwards at 
it. Rather than use the Kaiser Halberd it energized the Gauntlet Blade 
and stabbed the Qi force manipulation into the chest of the Fafnir. Oil 
was hurled into the air when the Oriax carved up the Fafnir&#39;s mechanical 
innards and ripped out the Gauntlet Blade. The white suit then flew away 
while the Fafnir was blown into nothing more than scrap metal. Onaba was 
killed. 

Hanuman was alone. But its pilot was becoming more and more incensed by 
the deaths of her comrades. &quot;...I&#39;ll kill you... I&#39;ll kill you... I&#39;ll 
kill you... I&#39;ll kill you... I&#39;ll kill you... I&#39;ll kill you... I&#39;ll kill 
you...I&#39;ll kill you... I&#39;ll kill you...I&#39;LL KILL YOU!&quot;

The Oriax faced off with the Hanuman once again for confrontation. But 
before the black mecha could even begin its attack on the 6000-year old 
suit, a chain of rapid fire shots came down from above and struck the 
Hanuman ruthlessly. Yumi could here Aratia screaming as she was taken 
out of the air and blow down to the ground level of Command Central.  
The Hanuman crashed into the surface, killing a few people below it and 
smashing the part of the wall it had landed on. It had not be destroyed 
and Aratia was still alive... but Hanuman was out of commission. Yumi 
was taken by surprise at that. The head of the Oriax cranked upwards to 
see who it was that had shot down Aratia&#39;s suit. In the blackened skies 
above Aryahm floated an amethyst-polished Meta Suit with its metallic 
arms crossed. The same suit that had flew into the heart of Meshezabel 
and activated the Elymus Drive. That same act triggered the Divine 
Cataclysm. The nightmare that ripped apart the world and began the 
Anthropos Era. It was the same suit that had single-handedly destroyed 
the nation of Xu and provoked the Jaankang Parliament to assassinate 
Tomoko&#39;s Father. 

That suit was known as the Diablos. 

Yumi was mesmerized when she saw it. Bright sapphire Qi burned around 
its body with vigour. The very air around those flames were warped. It 
gave this Meta Suit a far more intimidating air than even Yumi could 
have imagined possible. And when she looked at the readings from her 
control panel, she could see that this suit was running on a Qi-Level of 
59,000. This suit was nearly twice as powerful as the Raum of Freeman 
Ronove. She had never seen it before... but Yumi could not shake this 
unmistakable feeling of nostalgia she felt from the pilot&#39;s Qi. Who was 
that?

The pilot of the Diablos called out to Yumi from his suit. &quot;...Do not 
lower yourself by battling the weak, Yumi Mishima. In the holy name of 
Queen Ashura... I shall be your opponent. I shall rend thy body in two 
and I shall drink thy very soul. Thy bones shall be scattered into the 
winds and I shall quash thy heart in my own fist.&quot;

Yumi asked the question herself. &quot;...Who... are you...?&quot;

&quot;I am the Angel of Destruction,&quot; He replied, &quot;I am Deathcatcher.&quot;

A chill ran down Yumi&#39;s spine. Now she knew exactly who was piloting 
that suit. The same man she had met in the Sermo era. The man who had 
ended it. &quot;...Rain...?&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;What the hell are you talking about!?&quot; Yelled Terry, &quot;Why do you keep 
calling me TH-C4? What the hell does that mean?!&quot;

Diana smiled at him, removing her glasses from her face. &quot;So tense for 
one so young... in no obvious manner of speaking. To put it simply... 
you are nothing more than a product of war.&quot;

&quot;...What...?&quot;

&quot;You know of Project Sohei, do you not?&quot; Asked the older woman.

Terry growled. &quot;...Yeah. It was a plan by your people to harness the 
true strength of normal humans and transform them into the ultimate 
soldiers. So what?&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Diana smiled once again, &quot;that was the cover story. The thing 
that we at the Ministry of Metaphysical and Biotechnological Neo-Eugenic 
Research used to protect the image of our work from those who might wish 
to rebel. In reality the Sohei Project was a plan to create the ultimate 
army of biologically engineered human-weapons.&quot;

Terry&#39;s heart slowed. &quot;...W-what...?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the truth. There is a shortage of labour on this planet. Ever 
since the Divine Cataclysm the birth rate of the world itself has been 
steadily slipping. Though the Ashurian Empire has long maintained every 
possible advantage over the Earthlings in terms of military equipment... 
our overall numbers are far smaller than those of the land dwellers. So 
do you see what this whole affair really is? All members of the 
Schutzenreich are genetic duplicates of exceptional warriors from bygone 
eras. You yourself are a clone of a man who lived in the final days of 
the Sermo Period. A man that Yumi once knew. Terry Hennig. You, TH-C4, 
are a clone of that man.&quot;

&quot;N-no...&quot; Terry was shocked so badly that his voice was shaking, 
&quot;...this just... can&#39;t be... I remember... my parents...&quot;

Diana shook her head. &quot;You&#39;ve never had parents. In fact you have only 
been released from stasis for a year. The memories that you have are 
just fabrications I designed to induce the impression of a traditional 
life. In reality you are nothing more than a tool of war. After the 
Divine Cataclysm I tracked down all information I could on the cause. I 
learned of the battle between New Protocol and the Holy Protocol Army in 
space. And I soon learned of the outstanding talents of one individual 
in that battle. Terry Hennig. His mother and uncle were already 
profoundly involved in Protocolian life. Thankfully his Meta Suit was 
thrown to Earth after the battle. Then two years ago our group&#39;s search 
of the great soldiers of the past led us to the original&#39;s Meta Suit. We 
dug it up and used the most minute of DNA samples to produce you. But 
because the sample was so small... we had a great deal of effort in 
producing clones of that same man. You were the only successful 
bi-product of that experiment. But even so... your Bio-Rhythm is 
completely unstable. Deterioration will take place in less than a year.&quot;

Terry&#39;s blank eyes showed his horror. &quot;...I&#39;m a clone? And the rest of 
the... Schutzenreich...?&quot;

&quot;They are clones of other individuals,&quot; Diana answered, &quot;the only 
Schutzenreich member who is not a clone of anyone else is Aratia de 
Toscana. She was the first biologically engineered product I created for 
purposes of war. However I used my ovum for her... so... in most 
respects you should consider her to be my daughter. But developing a 
soldier from such a form is extremely costly. And considering Aratia&#39;s 
current lack of self-control... I think it was quite sensible for us to 
continue our research and production through the art of cloning.&quot;

&quot;...This can&#39;t be right...&quot; Mumbled the blonde clone. 

&quot;Oh, but it is. The Sohei Project was one of my biggest works. It was 
given to me as an order by Commander Gustav K&#148;hler. Of course I never 
programmed you to fall in love with his grandson, but... that was a 
welcomed result.  Because it showed to me that conformity in the mind of 
a biologically engineered soldier has a low probability ratio. Thus came 
the remodelling of the Marionettes...&quot;

Diana walked over to one of her other tables and placed her hand on a 
circular metal oval. On it were the printed words &#39;Stolas&#39;. &quot;Do you see 
this, TH-C4? This is the AI pod for the Stolas Marionettes. The machines 
that operate without pilots. Now take a good look...&quot;

The scientist pressed a button on its underside which flipped open the 
upper casing. Fahlem and Terry gazed at it. But then scowled when they 
saw what was inside. The fleshy pink ridges of a human brain, linked to 
a snake-like mesh of wires. &quot;...This is the true form of the Marionette 
AI. The internal core consists of the replicated cerebral cortex of an 
average Schutzenreich soldier. These AI-Brains are hardwired into both 
Metatron and the Ragnarok System. And they are all implanted with DNA 
from an Ashtar. In this sense... they are the true legacy of the Sohei 
Project. You are flawed, TH-C4. The fact that you can feel such emotions 
as love is proof of that. These brain caskets might not seem to be 
much... but they fulfil the role of a soldier to a far greater degree 
than a clone like you ever could. But considering that I myself am only 
a clone of the real Diana Katrianna... I can sympathise with the 
confusions you might be experiencing.&quot;

Terry was literally aghast. &quot;...What... gives you the right... to do 
things... like this... what gives you the right...?&quot;

&quot;I am a scientist,&quot; Said Diana, &quot;I do not make bones with the morality 
and ethics of a person blinded by their own lack of curiosity. I merely 
discover and do as I am commanded to. However... I have always had my 
own agenda. And you will see it take shape soon. The Stolas Marionettes 
will soon become an army owed only to Seraphiel.&quot;

Fahlem interjected. &quot;...Diana. I do not pretend to understand the depths 
of your suffering. But you do not understand everything about Seraphiel. 
It is far more powerful than any of us could understand. Such a thing 
cannot be controlled.&quot;

&quot;And yet you attempted to do so 6000 years ago, when you placed the 
Seraphiel nucleus into the Oriax, did you not?&quot;

&quot;...I am paying for my mistakes everyday,&quot; Fahlem said solemnly, &quot;...I 
pay with my tears and the agony in my heart. But that is why I seek to 
end this all now! I wish to make amends for my crimes!&quot;

&quot;You are too late,&quot; Diana stated, &quot;and my plan is already reaching its 
end. Deep below this base is a secret testing ground. Inside that 
testing ground is the Meta Suit I have developed for Seraphiel&#39;s 
Incarnation. That mecha is the Apocryphal.&quot;

Geist blinked. &quot;...Apocryphal...?&quot;

&quot;Yes. The ultimate Meta Suit. My plan was simple. To provide the 
ultimate body - Apocryphal - and the ultimate weapon - the Counter 
Kaiser Halberd - for the true God, to supply him with an army - the 
Stolas Marionettes - ready to be levied, and to induce the final thing 
that shall provoke its birth - the re-awakening of Demiurge - into the 
world. Once Seraphiel is reborn to all that I have prepared for it, it 
shall grant me with the one wish I have worked so hard for. The 
resurrection of Rachel and John. My beloved ones.&quot;

Terry&#39;s eyes flamed. &quot;You did ALL this just to revive two dead people?! 
You cloned yourself, engineered weapons, built Meta Suits, constructed 
brain-boxes; all so you could have one shred of happiness back?! Do you 
know how many people have suffered for this?! All for TWO people!?&quot;

Diana remained firm. &quot;The value of my daughter and husband outweigh the 
whole world in my eyes. My love for them will transcend time, morality 
and God.&quot;

&quot;...You&#39;re insane!&quot; Terry yelled, &quot;You&#39;re in-fucking-sane! You&#39;ve been 
playing all of us from the beginning!&quot;

Fahlem gripped his fist. &quot;What has become of you, Diana!? And how can 
you be so sure that Yumi will even restore the Oriax to its true form!?&quot;

&quot;She has no choice,&quot; Claimed the cloned scientist, &quot;Deathcatcher is 
already here. And if she wants anyone within a ten mile radius from 
Command Central to survive long enough to see tomorrow... she will have 
to use the Transmutation. The stage is finally set for the Rebirth of 
the Slayer of God...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Yumi couldn&#39;t believe it. It was him. Though Rain&#39;s voice had changed a 
lot, no longer possessing such fear and now marked fervour and strength, 
she was sure that it was him. Just as Fahlem had said to her. The Oriax 
floated just a short distance below the Diablos in the cloudy skies over 
the city of Aryahm. Aratia and her Hanuman Meta Suit had been downed. 
And now Deathcatcher himself had appeared from nowhere. 

Yumi pleaded with him. &quot;Rain, please listen to me! I know what you did! 
But I also know that the Triad of the Inquisition interfered with you! I 
can see that from the way you&#39;re talking! You sound just like Freeman 
did! But his fate doesn&#39;t have to be the same for you or me! It&#39;s not 
too late to fight their control!&quot;

&quot;...Control?&quot; Deathcatcher mimicked, &quot;What control? No one ever has a 
complete control over anything else. What I did I did as an act of my 
own free will. I slaughtered millions of lives in the name of God and I 
will do so again if need be. That is my destiny. The destiny that 
providence offered to the one who was fated to become the Catcher of 
Death. Meaningless words like your own will do nothing to sway my 
course.&quot;

Yumi tilted her head downwards. &quot;...Rain... how could you... did you 
miss Edwina and her family that much... so much so that you would make 
everyone else feel that pain?&quot;

Deathcatcher remained silent after hearing Edwina&#39;s name. 

&quot;...Did you kill all those people for that?&quot; Yumi kept on, &quot;because of 
what you felt for her? Because of what you couldn&#39;t say to her? Rain, 
you&#39;re not the only one that feels that way. I know... that same pain. 
I&#39;m struggling with it now. Clinging to a life I don&#39;t want by means of 
a power I didn&#39;t ask for and a fate I didn&#39;t deserve. I understand what 
you went through, now. Maybe I would not have been able to then but I do 
now! Please, Rain, stop this! Turn back into that sweet boy I spoke with 
in Green Cloud!&quot;

Deathcatcher sneered behind his mouthpiece. &quot;...Prepare yourself.&quot;

&quot;...You won&#39;t listen, will you?&quot; The hacker sighed, &quot;Fine! I&#39;ll break 
their hold over you, Rain! I&#39;ll stop the Triad from doing this to you!&quot;

The Oriax acted swiftly and darted upwards into the skies towards the 
Diablos. That purple Meta Suit uncrossed its large arms and spread apart 
the wing-like devises at its shoulders. The Oriax opened its free hand 
and fired off its Palm Gatling. The long turret extended from that hand 
and proceeded to offload hundreds of bullets in the Diablos&#39; direction. 
There was a momentary stillness. Then a spherical Qi Barrier enfolded 
the suit with all its sapphire energy. The bullets hit the shield 
repeatedly but could not break into it; only create minor ripples that 
spread from the point of shooting onwards. The Oriax quickly retracted 
its Palm Gatling from action and zoomed upwards again to attack at a 
closer distance. It was going to be impossible to beat the Diablos with 
just bullets. But Yumi felt that the Disruptor Extension Sword Mode of 
her weapon would be enough to make Rain see sense. The energy running 
through the Kaiser Halberd started to flicker once again, the Qi 
Generator running in tandem with Yumi&#39;s thoughts and the Elohim Program. 
Just as the Oriax flew up and slashed in the Diablos direction. With the 
kind of speed that Yumi had never seen before from a Meta Suit other 
than her own, the Diablos darted around that slash, with a movement so 
fast it seemed to be nothing more than a blur. The Diablos circled the 
Oriax once more and stopped behind it. Quickly the white suit turned 
around and slashed again with the Kaiser Halberd. The Diablos&#39; body 
leaned back with more of that blur movement and let the blade swing over 
its torso. The Oriax swung its weapon around into a two-handed grip and 
then cut downwards. But before it could even land a blow the Diablos 
vanished. The Kaiser Halberd hit nothing but air and Yumi was left 
speechless.

&quot;Where did it go?!&quot; She asked. 

Both she and the Oriax felt that first hand when the Diablos came 
rushing in from the right. It extended its spiked fist and punched the 
Oriax across its &#39;face&#39; A hard blow that sent shockwaves of force 
throughout the mecha and its circuits. Metal clashed with metal but 
flesh too suffered. Yumi cried out, feeling the pain of her suit first 
hand. Blood dripped in a cool line down from her cheek in fact. The pain 
receptors of the Oriax were just as active as ever. The Oriax flew 
backwards to escape a further blow, flapping its wings behind it. Once 
it had gained some distance from the super-fast Diablos, Yumi took the 
moment to wipe the blood from her face.

&quot;Blast,&quot; She expressed, &quot;...I don&#39;t want to hurt Rain. But I can&#39;t use 
any other weapons on him. If I use the SU-Wave it might injure the 
people of Aryahm, too. Maybe if I use the Disruptor Rail Gun and aim it 
fully at the Diablos then I can slow its movements down. Yes... that&#39;s 
it.&quot;

The Oriax soon lifted the Kaiser Halberd into place. The Elohim Program 
perceived the pattern of Yumi&#39;s thoughts and the twin-hub casing of the 
blast shifted forwards to surround the blade from either side without 
closing around it. This was the position for the Disruptor Rain Gun 
Mode. Streaks of black lightning force coursed up and down the blade 
while the Kaiser Halberd drew in energy for the blast. And moments 
afterwards a huge beam wave of pure negative force exploded from the 
blade. That black wave streamed across the grim skies of Aryahm and 
engulfed the air around the Diablos in a consuming pattern. The cry of 
the energy rumbled throughout the air and echoed across the city, 
spreading its sonic waves outwardly. The Diablos was caught in the 
middle of that, swallowed up in a cloud of smoke which crackled and 
smouldered with bolts of black lightning running up and down it. When 
the beam subsided the Oriax pulled down the Kaiser Halberd and reverted 
it back into normal mode; the hub-like casing closing down on the blade 
to conceal it once more. It was then that Yumi stared at her video 
screen to see the damage. 

Or rather the lack of it.

Once the clouds of smoke and the streaks of lightning surrounded them 
started to dissolve, the Diablos was revealed again. Around its body was 
another azure Qi Barrier. And the Meta Suit inside of that barrier was 
totally unharmed. 

Yumi&#39;s mouth was left wide open. &quot;Impossible!&quot;

&quot;...Hmph,&quot; Deathcatcher&#39;s eyes hardened, &quot;You are relying far too much 
on that new weapon of yours. You think that could ever be a substitute 
for your true power? Is this the force that destroyed the last Thanatos 
of the Sermo Era? Why do you hide your suit&#39;s true self?&quot;

&quot;Are you talking about Demiurge?!&quot; Yumi questioned.

&quot;Correct.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t! I won&#39;t use that again!&quot;

Deathcatcher snarled. &quot;...You cannot defeat me without it. You know 
that. It was only because of that ability that you were able to destroy 
the Raum and its pilot. And you know as well as I do that my powers far 
transcend that of Freeman Ronove. You are experiencing that for yourself 
now. So shirk the manacles of restraint. Open yourself to your suit&#39;s 
true form and show me your ultimate power.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t!&quot; Yumi cried.

&quot;...Very well.&quot; The Diablos subsequently un-crossed its metallic arms 
and aimed its arm down at the city of Aryahm. 

Yumi&#39;s heart leapt into her mouth. &quot;W-what are you doing?!&quot;

&quot;...If you refuse to show me your true strength willingly...&quot; 
Deathcatcher began, &quot;then I shall demolish everything that is currently 
below us.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a lie! You wouldn&#39;t do that! Those people there are Ashurians! 
They are loyal to Ashura! This city itself is an Ashurian possession! 
You would never destroy it!&quot;

&quot;Ashurians?&quot; Said Deathcatcher, derisively, &quot;Do you really believe that 
the holy people of Meshezabel are of the same stock as these 
land-dwelling scum? This city was created specifically as an operational 
outpost for the Schutzenreich. And no more. While it may possess 
technology that can be classed at a similar level to that of 
Meshezabel... its people are no more to us than livestock. This city 
itself is infested with sin. An insubstantial and claustrophobic 
settlement for depravity and covetousness. Once the Novus Deus is 
reborn; all such colonies of decadence will be torn asunder. To 
devastate this municipality now would be no more than an aid to God.&quot;

&quot;Rain! Stop it! Leave these people out of it!&quot; Shouted the hacker.

The world murderer formerly known as Rain Harland snorted at that. &quot;If 
you have the means to stop me, then do so.&quot;

There was a tremendous anxiety in Yumi&#39;s heart. If Deathcatcher was not 
stopped now then he would ruin all of Aryahm. Millions of people were 
down there. Including Fahlem, Terry and Lune. And Tomoko probably hadn&#39;t 
gotten back to the Kamiyashiki yet. But at the same time she had made a 
promise not to use the Demiurge form again. In the end she had no choice 
in the matter. There was no way Yumi could allow Deathcatcher to do to 
Aryahm what he did to Xu and the Sermo Period civilization. It was a 
risk she just had to take. Yumi took a deep breath and tapped the code  
Q5F6XS97HI into the control panel. Instantaneously the Oriax responded. 
The video screen in front of her was rapidly filled with the phrase &#39;De 
Mundo&#39;. One which repeated over and over again. From that panel snaked 
out the wires of the program, attaching themselves to Yumi&#39;s arms, neck 
and temple. A thin gelatinous liquid surged from those cables and into 
Yumi&#39;s bloodstream once again. The girl remembered the pain she felt the 
last time and it was the same this time. Her screams filled the cockpit 
and were heard by Deathcatcher inside his own. The process had begun. 
The former Rain crossed the arms of his Meta Suit, retracting its arm. 
Yumi had initiated the Transmutation ability of the Oriax. 

And now the Oriax was evolving into its truest form.

The machine&#39;s mouthpiece broke open and the wide jaws opened to call out 
a scream. One that ran out in sync with the screams of Yumi inside its 
cockpit. The colour of the armour itself began to morph as if doused in 
a colouring bleach. Tones of purple and silver ran into the armour. From 
the back of the Oriax, six more wings sprouted vibrantly. Those wings 
were born of Yumi&#39;s Qi force, purified to give its energy the tint of 
cerulean. A huge tremor of force spread outwardly throughout the air as 
the new form of the Oriax flapped its wings. Those force waves blew past 
the Diablos and smashed into the grounds below, packing the force of a 
full-contact punch. The people standing up in Aryahm were blown off 
their feet. The windows that felt the shockwaves within their immediate 
radius of a mile were shattered. And so was formed the terrific 
instrument of destruction that had slaughtered the Raum Meta Suit.

Demiurge.

Deathcatcher smiled under his chin mask. &quot;...So. At last you show 
yourself to me. Your true self.&quot;

Demiurge pushed its eight wings back, raising its head and screaming 
into the skies with that bestial cry. But soon after it became clear 
that more was happening inside the suit. Demiurge clawed and gnashed at 
its chest with its hands, is if something was trying to break free. It 
bellowed out more of its terrible and frightening screams. Then a huge 
golden light burst out from the Demiurge. That insanely bright light 
shone across the entire city. Anyone out of doors at that point would 
have had to close their eyes from the staggering brightness that was now 
emanating from the Oriax&#39;s true form. That eruption of glorious 
luminosity could be seen as far away as the Kamiyashiki. Skye, Suzuhara 
and Neela picked up tremendous readings from it. And through the video 
screen of the ship&#39;s bridge, that light could be seen flawlessly. The 
stone ground directly beneath the sky-hovering Demiurge started to 
crack. It shattered into itself like the erosion of ice to an ice pick. 
While in the centre of that maelstrom of light, the Demiurge continued 
to scream and thrash. The Diablos hovered there for a moment. Then it 
flew off in a backwards motion, watching the reaction of Demiurge take 
place. Once those ministrations reached their zenith, something started 
to phase out of the chest plate of the Demiurge. An entity that appeared 
to be no more than a naked teenage boy, with a long flowing locks of 
gold hair. The ethereal golden light that shone from Demiurge was now 
shining from that boy. And soon the light itself faded into the heart of 
the being that had dragged itself from the body of Demiurge. The teenage 
boy with the long golden hair was now left hovering in the air, his 
torso  still brimming with an intense golden aura.

Throughout all of this, somehow, Yumi had managed to retain her 
consciousness.  Her body was surrounded in her silver Qi flames and her 
skin was covered in blue veins, the cables of the panel still linked 
with her flesh. But she could now open her eyes and see what was 
happening. She could see the golden-haired boy floating in the air. And 
she felt a twinge of familiarity inside her heart when she did. 

This was Seraphiel Incarnate.

Though his lips parted with speech, his words could only be heard in the 
ears of Yumi. &quot;...My dearest friend...&quot;

Yumi was gob smacked. &quot;Who... what... are you...?&quot;

&quot;I have no name,&quot; Said Seraphiel Incarnate, &quot;a name exists as more than 
a simple mark of distinction to someone of my kind. A name should be a 
representation of the feelings and emotions that a person undergoes when 
they address that entity.&quot;

&quot;...I feel... as... though I&#39;ve heard of that before...&quot;

Seraphiel Incarnate nodded. &quot;You have. We spent 6000 years together. I 
delved into your mind and you did with mine. I felt your pain... and I 
did all that I could to comfort you. Until the time in which you would 
be awakened to fulfil your destiny. I have removed all memories of those 
years we spent in the world of our own making, The Void. I wanted you to 
experience the rest of your life without the restraints of such 
memories. It broke my heart to do so... if such a being as myself can 
possess a heart. If I did not have such a thing upon my conception... 
then I greatly suspect that it was given to me as a result of your 
influence, Yumi. For that gift, I thank you.&quot;

&quot;...But... what are you?&quot; Asked Yumi once more.

&quot;I am the humanoid incarnation of a being that transcends time itself. 
You people of the world have chosen to regard me as &#39;Seraphiel&#39;. If it 
will make it easier for you to understand what I say to you then please 
consider me as such. You see in each planet of the universe there is an 
internal force that comprises the existence of that same planet. From 
the very beginning of a planet&#39;s life this force matures into a singular 
cogent being. The role of that being is to guide, guard and nourish the 
planet with its power. And those organisms are the Messiahs. And I am 
the Messiah of planet Earth.&quot;

Yumi blinked. &quot;...M-Messiah...?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Confirmed Seraphiel Incarnate, &quot;our given roles as Messiahs are 
to purify and protect the worlds we were spawned from. However... there 
will be events or circumstances that not even the Messiahs can contain. 
One such event occurred on this planet. A global geological catastrophe 
many years ago caused my imprisonment inside the Earth&#39;s core. Stopping 
me from guiding the world. And when Hashabnah detected no signature 
Messiah from this planet, it came down to Earth to take on that role.&quot;

&quot;Hashabnah?&quot;

&quot;That which you call Novus Deus. That also is a Messiah. It hailed from 
another planet which had been devastated by an uncontrollable climate 
disturbance. And so it came here. However. The fate of the Earth can 
only be decided by the Messiah that oversees it. Therefore my given duty 
is to vanquish it. And to vanquish all those upon the Earth who have 
descended from it &quot;

Yumi&#39;s throat quivered. &quot;...You mean people... humanity...&quot;

&quot;I have no choice,&quot; Said the boy with the golden aura, &quot;...it is a fate 
that has been pre-written into the mind and soul of every Messiah. A 
practice that has maintained since the dawn of time. What I do... I do 
with a heavy heart... yet my will is bound to that same fate.&quot;

&quot;...Why?&quot; Yumi asked, &quot;Why?&quot;

The sadness in Seraphiel Incarnate&#39;s eyes were apparent. &quot;I am sorry, 
Yumi. I do not wish to kill you. You are the brightest star of them all. 
So I will forgo our confrontation for the time being. If you still wish 
to stop the genocide that I shall cleave... you will have three days to 
do so. Farewell, my dearest friend.&quot;

In that instant, Seraphiel Incarnate spread out his arms. His head 
tilted back and his eyes closed. His body began to glow brighter with 
that golden Qi force of his. And these actions seemed to have an effect 
on the world beneath him. On ground level, the stone floor that framed 
itself around Command Central continued to crack. There was a sudden 
rumbling that came from the major point of those cracks. Then a Meta 
Suit burst up from the ground. That suit was Apocryphal. Yumi watched as 
the suit arose with tremendous speed until it stood behind Seraphiel 
Incarnate, floating in an aura that was almost identical to that of its 
future pilot. Apocryphal&#39;s armour was a gold-tinted titanium, polished 
up nicely. The form of the body was jagged and angular, but also with a 
dominating air to it. From its back extended eight metallic proportions. 
Like thin limbs. Each of those limbs opened and sprouted a wing of 
golden light, each of them more than 300 metres in length. And in the 
hand of the Apocryphal was the Counter Kaiser Halberd. Identical to 
Yumi&#39;s own; except it was made of a gold casing rather than white. And 
when Yumi saw that she knew that Diana Katrianna was behind this suit. 

Seraphiel Incarnate pulled up its fist up and the ground down below 
started to react again. The floor around Command Central ruptured in 
hundreds of places and hundreds of Stolas Marionettes leapt up from the 
rubble. They zoomed into the air under the horsepower of their thrusters 
and joined the Apocryphal. An army of Marionettes were now orbiting the 
golden-haired boy who had shared in Yumi&#39;s consciousness. Seraphiel 
Incarnate moved backwards through the air towards the Apocryphal. The 
stomach doors into the cockpit parted for the God of the Earth. He 
entered and the Apocryphal itself was re-activated. Its jade eyes 
brightened with life and the azure-coloured exhaust of its wing 
thrusters kick-started. Soon afterwards Apocryphal darted off into the 
skies with its army flagging behind it. And Yumi was left inside the 
Demiurge with a look of confusion and utter sadness in her heart. 

Another great tragedy was about to unfold.

2. Main Characters  

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Yumi Mishima
The last &#39;Eros&#39; of Sermo period and the main character of the Messiah 
Series. Her adoptive father, Katsuragi Mishima, who was a member of 
Protocol, found her embryo with his investigative team in 2135. She was 
then raised and studied at a research facility until the age of eight 
when her Qi exploded to life during an attack on her father, killing 
both assailants. This event caused Yumi much personal distress and 
caused her lapse into a coma.  When she awoke, five years later at the 
age of thirteen, she had  lost all memory of her life before that age.  
She was then shunted to Meta-Tokyo where she lived alone until the age 
of 18 (though she was always under the observation of Protocol). She 
attended college alongside Chizuru/Chizu Yagata (who made a point of 
spying on Yumi for the purpose of documenting her development). 
Eventually she and &#39;Chizuru&#39; were confronted by agents of Protocol, ones 
which Yumi killed. This caused her to override a small portion of the 
biological lock placed on her powers by her father, and allowed her to 
pilot the Oriax which took her out of Meta Tokyo. After meeting with 
Terry Hennig and the crew of the Leviathan, Yumi was recaptured by 
Protocol, and labour was forcibly induced on her. It gave birth only to 
another Vulnus Deus, but triggered off Divine Hibernation around Yumi. 
When she escaped her Qi, she attained the level of Demi-Gnosis and 
deflected three blasts from the AM-Cannon, which in turn prolonged the 
Sermo Period. Shortly after the Great Schism, Yumi officially joined 
ranks with Chrysalis and was challenged by Freeman Ronove in the village 
of Green Cloud. Yumi accepted that challenge and faced him on the ice of 
Antarctica. The Oriax was greatly damaged in that fight, until Yumi was 
prompted to use its ability of Transmutation. This transformed the suit 
into its &#39;true form&#39;, Demiurge. After the destruction of the Raum and 
the killing of Freeman, Yumi underwent a second Divine Hibernation and 
both she and Demiurge were swallowed up in it. 6000 years later she was 
freed from her Qi sphere when the Ashurian Empire excavated the Oriax. 
She soon after escaped into the new world and journeyed to retrieve the 
Oriax. This path led her to Aryahm where she was confronted by 
Deathcatcher. To stop him from causing another great tragedy she used 
the derider once more to unlock the Demiurge form of the Oriax once 
more, thus causing the reincarnation of Seraphiel. 

Yumi has tremendous Qi. When pushed to an absolute limit she can warp 
time and space, so a biological lock was placed on her to retrain most 
of her abilities (which was later broken). Due to her exposure to 
violence at such a young age, she is introverted and softly spoken, 
without being shy. Though Divine Hibernation did much to give her 
confidence, her feelings for Chizu still linger and hurt her.

Terry Hennig (original)
A young man who has a laidback, careless, humoured, vain personality and 
is a bit of a ladies man. When he was a child, his parents were killed 
when his runaway uncle, Waltrech Hennig (General Naam) disguised an 
attack Terry&#39;s village of Eberbach as a training exercise. Terry swore 
revenge for it and thus joined Chrysalis. He was then posted to gain 
information on Yumi, and developed feelings for her along the way. When 
she was recaptured by Protocol, Terry led a single handed attack on Ix 
Nos Babel, one that would have gotten him killed; if not for the 
Asmodeus. Eventually he discovered the truth about what happened in his 
past (and that his mother, Lilith, was forced to become one with the 
Asmodeus suit) and killed General Naam in the field of battle. After the 
Great Schism he helped battle Holy Protocol in space, but was unable to 
stop Deathcatcher from using the Elymus Drive. Shortly after the Divine 
Cataclysm his Meta Suit was damaged and it crash-landed on the Earth, 
killing him.

Chizu Yagata/Chizuru Matsubana
A young woman whose parents were murdered when she was a child. She then 
sought revenge and it was given to her when a member of the Protocol 
council adopted her and gave her training in gun handling. She took her 
revenge on the killer and thereafter became a spy for Protocol as a 
trade off for the training that Chizuru got. She was sent to keep an eye 
on Yumi, and thus fed information to Celaph (her leader and fianc&#130;e) 
about the girl and the location of EDEN. She later joined New Protocol 
as a result of the Great Schism. Chizu was then killed during the Divine 
Cataclysm.

Rain Harland/Deathcatcher
An Ashtar who lived in the American village of Green Cloud. Quiet and 
respectful, but also very lonely, he protected the village in his 
outdated Meta Suit, Syoga. His only friend was a stable girl named 
Edwina, who he had feelings for. When Edwina and her family were  gunned 
down by Freeman and the Raum, the trauma Rain underwent produced a 
Divine Hibernation. From which the Triad altered his mind and 
transformed him into a cold and ruthless killer known as Deathcatcher. 
Shortly afterwards, Deathcatcher piloted his Diablos Meta Suit and flew 
into the heart of Meshezabel, activating the Elymus Drive. This action 
caused the Divine Cataclysm, which ruined the Sermo period civilization 
and paved the way for the Anthropos era. His purpose now is to serve as 
a knight for Ashura and the Triad of the Inquisition. He has done that 
for the past 6000 years, and he flew down to Aryahm in the Diablos to 
meet with Yumi. Provoking the Oriax&#39;s transformation into Demiurge and 
thus the reincarnation of Seraphiel. Once a kind and shy young man, he 
has become cold, dark and inhuman.

Freeman Ronove
The last &#39;Thanatos&#39; of the Sermo generation. He was a normal young man 
until he was kidnapped and brainwashed by Protocol from the French 
village he grew up in at the age of 15. His mind was then wiped to 
remove all memory of this, but this caused a mental collapse within him 
and Freeman became mildly insane. After impregnating Yumi he was 
summoned to the Hall of Garatia, and selected to become pilot of the 
Raum. However the Triad soon rethought this and used him only to produce 
a second Divine Hibernation within Yumi. And after he attacked the 
village of Green Cloud, as commanded, he was confronted by Yumi and the 
Oriax. Freeman and the Raum were then both destroyed. A man with severe 
mental disturbance, in his time of life, his level of Qi rivalled that 
of Yumi.

Naam/Waltrech Hennig
The former leader of the mobile Meta Suit army of Protocol, known as 
Divine Blade. He was haughty and proud, and commanded much respect from 
his subordinates. He was also the man whose training in the outside 
world killed the people of his old village. Including his brother. The 
only survivor being his nephew, Terry Hennig, and his step sister, 
Lilith Hennig (who he loved). Naam took her to Ix Nos Babel and demanded 
that they save Lilith&#39;s life, which caused her to be placed in the life 
support module of the Asmodeus. He was killed by Terry in the Battle of 
Ix Nos Babel.

Geist Fahlem/Shugo Yamamoto 
Formerly the Japanese scientist who worked alongside Dr. Katsuragi, 
Fahlem was an Ashtar who gained favour with the Triad of the Inquisition 
for his high Qi level and brilliant intellect. After the death of Dr. 
Mishima, he implanted nanomachines into his blood so that he could 
extend his life. He also underwent plastic surgery to change himself, 
and thus became the man known as Geist Fahlem. Fahlem was then selected 
by the Triad to act as the helper of Bahaman, Keeper of the Source. 
Since then his loyalties have remained with Bahaman. Geist was 
instrumental in the production of the Oriax, as well as the Three Gods 
of Wrath and Meshezabel, as well as the Ragnarok System. He gained 
Complete Gnosis and became an Ishtar, and also participated in the 
monitoring of Princess Ashura from the earliest age. After much time 
working for the Ashurian Empire, he decided that he had to atone for his 
crimes, and thus fully joined forces with Caliph Bahaman and the nation 
of Geshem. When Yumi was freed from the ice 6000 years after the 
destruction of the world, he journeyed with her to Aryahm, where 
Seraphiel&#39;s reincarnation took place. A knowledgeable and kind man, he 
carries a strong sense of duty to Geshem as well as a sadness for his 
crimes.

Queen Ashura/Leah Cloud
The former notional head of the Holy Empire of Protocol and the 
subordinate of the Triad of the Inquisition. She was once a normal girl 
in Meta Cardiff until the Triad of the Inquisition kidnapped her and 
brainwashed her mind, injecting her with nanomachines to prolong her 
life. Thus she became Princess Ashura and led the HEoP during the Great 
Schism. After the Divine Cataclysm, Ashura was crowed &#39;Queen&#39; and set up 
court in the space city of Meshezabel. Her personality is regal, calm 
and knowing. She is also an Ashtar. As one of the Three Stars, she has a

Aratia de Toscana 
The ace pilot of Schutzenreich and one of the Shinjinkai Team. She was 
the first and most successful product of the Sohei Project, and was 
created with the ovum of Diana Katrianna, head scientist of the 
experiment at the time. Aratia&#39;s memory of such creation was wiped out 
and her mind was re-written (to make her believe that she was adopted) 
and because of this she believes that she is a pure-blooded, &#39;natural&#39; 
Meshezablian. She&#39;s posted in Aryahm to oversee production of the 
ultimate Meta Suit but her mission will change once Yumi is awake. Her 
personality is flirty, bloodthirsty and devious, but she has a good

talent. When he was introduced into Schutzenreich he was given the 
Bishamon M-4 as a mark of his new rank. However, he has none of the 
original Terry Hennig&#39;s memories. He left the group after a disagreement 
with its leader, Gustav Kohler. A confident and outgoing young man, he 
is presently in a relationship with the hacker Skye Kohler. Though a

Seraphiel Incarnate 
The humanoid reincarnation of the Seraphiel Messiah. His fate is not 
written on the Tablets of Destiny and because of this; the possibility 
of it gaining an incarnation is a big issue to the Ashurian Empire. Once 
Yumi unlocked the power of Demiurge for a second time, Seraphiel 
Incarnate was born unto the world for the first time in millennia. He 
merged with the Meta Suit Apocryphal and took command of the 
Stolas-Marionettes that Diana had constructed for him. His will now is 
only to destroy humanity and the Novus Deus, to re-assume his position 
as Messiah of the Earth.

Diana Katrianna 
The mastermind behind the Sohei Project and the &#39;mother&#39; of Aratia. 
Diana (back then Emma) was a scientist in early Protocol days. Her 
husband was archaeologist who found a parchment on Seraphiel during a 
dig. It was the Scroll of Sariel. It said that Seraphiel was destined to 
extract the &#39;power of sin&#39; and kill God. When this was discovered by the 
Triad, they had  the couple&#39;s daughter, Rachel, killed. Emma&#39;s husband 
hung himself in grief. Emma then went about looking for ways to bring 
them back. She learned of nanotechnology and created hundreds of bodies 
for herself. Then downloaded her memories into a mini-disc which could 
be plugged into her brain (which she would do every time one of her 
bodies weakened to keep herself alive). Bringing back Rachel and her 
husband was impossible because they possessed a rare blood group that 
could not be replicated. Eventually she learned that Seraphiel had the 
power to restore life, and so devoted herself to reviving its force. She 
underwent plastic surgery and renamed herself &#39;Diana&#39;. She later (after 
the Divine Cataclysm) learned that Seraphiel would incarnate itself once 
more so prepared herself for that time by joining the Ashurian Empire 
and participating/starting the Sohei Project. She has now created the 
ultimate vessel for Seraphiel Incarnate, Apocryphal, so that it would 
bring back both Rachel and her husband and destroy the Triad of the 
Inquisition (she also developed the innards of the modern marionette 
systems, which are nanotechnological replicas of brains). Diana 
developed the Hanuman, Sabnock and Fafnir Meta Suits as well as the core 
of the Marionettes. Age 28.

and she was revived, but was unable to sustain her own life. So they 
hooked her up to a machine body. And that body was of the most powerful

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

4. Organizations 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Protocol 
Protocol was a scientific/political/religious organization that acted as 
a global government on Earth during the latter half of the Sermo Period. 
Protocol and its followers regard the original Novus Deus to be its God, 
and all its incarnations through the years its &#39;offspring&#39;. The HQ of 
Protocol is a tower in the Arctic island of Kyoga called Ix Nos Babel. 
The three original leaders of Protocol were the Triad of the 
Inquisition. Protocol are behind many scientific discoveries and 
inventions. They created the Meta Suit (most glaring being Oriax, Raum, 
The Three Gods of Wrath, etc), the Ragnarok System, Meshezabel, the 
AM-Cannon, the Elymus Drive, and so on. They were also the ones to 
unearth the Tablets of Destiny, resurrecting the old tales of Novus 
Deus. The group remains as the most influential organization of all Five 
Ages. 

- New Protocol: A faction created as a result of the Great Schism. It 
was led by William Ank Celaph and those loyal to him when he decided to 
break away from the cruelty of the Triad of the Inquisition. As a 
military force it had one major army to its name, the New Protocol Meta 
Suit Division (NPMSD) which was almost wiped out in the battle in moon&#39;s 
orbit. Shortly after the Divine Cataclysm, the members of New Protocol 
were rounded up and killed, thus quashing the faction. 

- Holy Empire of Protocol: The other half of Protocol, created as a 
result of the Great Schism. It consisted of those who remained loyal to 
the Triad of the Inquisition and those who saw that life had to be 
prepared in the right way for the coming of the Novus Deus. The group&#39;s 
figurehead leader was Princess Ashura, but in truth it was commanded by 
the Triad of the Inquisition. Once the Divine Cataclysm was instigated 
on the world by Deathcatcher, it became the dominant power on earth (but 
eventually forsook the name &#39;Protocol&#39;). 

- The Upper Council: A group of representatives from each country of the 
world before the Divine Cataclysm. Though they appeared to be a solid 
government, they were no more than a puppet show for Protocol to display 
its democracy. A fact that is shown when the Upper Council disintegrates 
after the Great Schism. 

- The Triad of the Inquisition: The alliance formed between the Three 
Wise Men; Aherg, Ein, and Karahi. Though born in the Nous Period, they 
didn&#39;t excerpt any control over the world until the Sermo era, when they 
single-handedly created the Protocol organization. Because of their 
Demi-Gnosis state (which is significantly different from those of 
others) they cannot sustain their own existences in the natural world. 
So they created their own private dimension from which they can guide 
their interests. Because of this, the Triad has a representative perform 
their will for them (with Princess Ashura and Celaph being prime 
examples of that). 

- The Divine Blade: The military force which was the primary division of 
the Holy Protocol Army both before and after the Great Schism. Its power 
was feared for years because of its many talented Meta Suit pilots. The 
Divine Blade&#39;s main Meta Suit for use was the Amon (which was supported 
by Allocers, Baals, Zagans, as well as custom suits like the Bahamut, 
the Morax and the Eon). Its leader was General Naam, who later succeeded 
by Selena Fol. Members of the Divine Blade include General Naam, Selena, 
Kraepelin, Steed, Aria, Ry, etc. 

Chrysalis
A small but influential militia which was created to both defend EDEN 
and free the citizens of the Meta Cities in the Sermo era. Its leader 
was Cecelia Faye Beatrix, and it operated out of the giant battleship 
Leviathan. Its Meta Suit troops consisted of Uvalls, Gusions and the 
custom suits Oriax and Bishamon/Bishamon M-2. Some of its members were 
Beatrix, Sophia, Yumi and Terry. 

The Ashurian Empire 
That which Protocol became after the Divine Cataclysm took place. The 
Ashurian Empire, headed by Queen Ashura and the Triad of the 
Inquisition, began creating its own race to populate Meshezabel and then 
worked on expanding its military force. After establishing themselves in 
space, the Ashurians then turned to the Earth and is now spreading its 
influence across the planet. Members of the Ashurian Empire are 
numerous, including Ashura, Aherg, Ein and Karahi, Deathcatcher, Aratia 
de Toscana, Doctor Mien, Geist Fahlem, Long Wu Quan, Onaba, Ryoufei, 
Gustav K&#148;hler, Diana Katrianna, etc. 

- Ministry of Metaphysical and Biotechnological Neo-Eugenic Research: 
The scientific team that Diana Katrianna heads in Aryahm. They were 
behind the Sohei Project, the Stolas-marionettes, Apocryphal, the Kaiser 
Halberd and the Counter Kaiser Halberd, as well as the duty of 
maintaining the Gospel Template and the Ragnarok System.  

- The Templar Sages: The first half of the Ashurian Empire&#39;s army. This 
operates from Meshezabel and acts as its primary defence. Though 
Deathcatcher&#39;s control over the army is informal, he is considered to be 
its commander. The Templar Sages consist mainly of Meta Suits. 

- The Schutzenreich: This is the second half of the army of the Ashurian 
Empire. Its station is primarily on Earth and so it is seen as the most 
powerful Earth-bound military ever. It consists mainly of Meta Suits.

- The Shinjinkai: The name for the three most skilled pilots in the 
Schutzenreich, Aratia, Ryoufei and Onaba. Because of their status they 
are given special treatment wherever they go. 

- Council Electorate: The descendants of the Upper Council, and those 
who supplement Queen Ashura&#39;s rule with their guidance. They make the 
smaller decisions that neither the Triad nor Queen Ashura concern 
themselves with.

5. Locations/Buildings

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

(Pre Cataclysm) 

Ix Nos Babel
The former HQ of the Protocol organization. It is a gigantic tower built 
on Kyoga Island in the Arctic Circle. It has a height of over 23 
kilometres and a width of 0.6 kilometres. Ix Nos Babel was constructed 
over the site of the Ancient Ruins, so that the excavations of the 
Ancient Ruins could continue unabated. After the Great Cataclysm, it 
became no more than a very large research facility. 

Temple of Tlazolteotl
The temporary home of Princess Ashura and her followers during the Great 
Schism. 

Shinrai Building
The outpost of Protocol affairs in Japanese society. It was the same 
place where Celaph was stationed to oversee the capture of Yumi Mishima 
and the destruction of the Chrysalis, during the Sermo period. 
 
- Ochiai Underground Research Facility: A underground laboratory complex 
beneath the Shinrai building. Many experiments took place there, 
including the production of the Oriax (and thus the sealing of 
Seraphiel). During the Sermo era it was seen as the hub of scientific 
discovery, even over Ix Nos Babel. 

The Sky Cords
Four gigantic tower-like structures designed to allow transport into 
space. The four Sky Cords were the North American, South American, West 
European and the East Asian. A few more were due to be commissioned but 
they was scraped when the Meshezabel project was abandoned by Protocol. 

Green Cloud
A small American village within the state of Texas, one which was raided 
by Freeman and the Raum. It was thereafter destroyed during the Divine 
Cataclysm. It was the hometown of Deathcatcher. 

EDEN
The enormous metal city created in the sea. It created by Father 
Bartholomeus and his followers during the latter Sermo era. It was an 
outpost for people who did not want to live under Protocol&#39;s rule, and 
the base of operations for Chrysalis. It was briefly captured by 
Protocol but was then later released by Celaph. In the Divine Cataclysm 
it was destroyed. At its height, EDEN housed over 950,000 people. 

Ancient Ruins
A very large temple under the Arctic, created by the ancient humans 
during the early Nous period. Inside its halls rested the Tablets of 
Destiny. 
 
Kyoga Island
An artificial island in the Arctic Circle created in the Sermo Period 
after the discovery of the Ancient Ruins. Ix Nos Babel rests upon it and 
it was once protected by three lines of defence (which were destroyed by 
Bishamon M-2 and the Asmodeus). 

The Lunar Station
The only recognized space outpost for the Protocol organization during 
the Sermo era. It holds the AM-Cannon.  

The Hall of Garatia 
This is the mini-dimension that the Triad of the Inquisition created and 
operate from. 

The Mouth of the Shenlong 
A base for the Chrysalis group in the Gobi Desert. 

(Post Cataclysm) 

Meshezabel 
A large space-city that was created over a ninety year period by 
Protocol. It was abandoned by Protocol at the command of the Upper 
Council after so many people died to build it, just when it was 92% 
complete. Meshezabel was then left to float in the Moon&#39;s orbit. Its 
people, numbering at 1.2 million, are all the future forms of human 
beings and are descendants of the nanotechnologically manufactured race 
(Homo Perdignus). Thus they are an essentially peaceful people, 
oblivious to the suffering of the surface worlders. It is the seat of 
the Ashurian Empire and though controlled by Queen Ashura; the highest 
authority is the Triad of the Inquisition. It&#39;s protected by 
Deathcatcher and the second half of the Divine Army of the Ashurian 
Empire, the Templar Sages. It contains factories of nanomachine 
technology as well as the Elymus Drive. It is big enough to house more 
than 2 million people. 

Horan (South/North/West/East) 
A Large east-central grassland region. It is not a formal nation but a 
land covered with sparse and separated villages. The closest thing it 
has to a city is the village of Troas.   

Canaan
A desert nation; held to scorn by the world. This is because it pays no 
homage to Meshezabel or Aryahm. It joined forces with its neighbouring 
country, Xu, and waged war on Aryahm 32 years ago. When Xu was 
destroyed, Kaiser Veitshied Xirau III surrendered and abdicated the 
throne, leaving it to his son. Canaan now lives in fear of attack. Its 
people are slaves, experimented on and exploited. Its major city is 
Azgad.

Xu/The Islands of Baan
Formerly the nation of Xu. When it joined forces with Canaan and started 
a three-year long war, it ended when Deathcatcher was commissioned by 
Aryahmese officials to take care of the situation. Deathcatcher 
destroyed the state ruthlessly, transforming it into a clump of islands 
known as Baan. Though it is no longer recognized as a nation, people 
still live there and burn with hatred for the Ashurian Empire. 

St. Mary&#39;s Base
An Ashurian base in Western Horan, built with an underground sea-port 
for access to the ocean via the Tarawa River. It is where the Kaiser 
Halberd was constructed. 

The Forests of Seth
A large set of forests that stretch out for miles around the South Horan 
landscape. 

South Shidou Investigative Research Station
A research facility in the South Horan ice flats which took on the 
responsibility of guarding Lune White and excavating the Oriax. 

Command Central/Control Central 
The main base of the Ashurian Empire on Earth&#39;s surface, located in the 
super city Aryahm. The Schutzenreich operate out of it and run Ashurian 
affairs from there. 

Aryahm
A city-sized nation built below Meshezabel. It&#39;s almost as 
technologically advanced as Meshezabel, but its people are still seen as 
a lower class. Potentially it acts as a gateway/way station between 
Meshezabel and the Earth. Though it is not an autonomous nation it&#39;s 
seen by surface people as such.   

Jaankang
Former Japan. An Asiatic nation wishing to break from the grip of 
Shengese power 

Shengong
An Asiatic nation to the east. It was one of the first nations to sell 
out to the Ashurian Empire once the strength of Aryahm was revealed. It 
is ruled by a council which is in the pocket of the Ashurian Empire. Its 
major city is Kyurai.

Shidou
Iceland region to the far south (former Antarctica). Like Horan it has 
no national recognition. 

Geshem 
An alternate dimension world that was created by the Triad of the 
Inquisition 300 years before Deathcatcher destroyed the old world. Its 
ruled by Caliph Bahaman, the keeper of the source. It eventually broke 
its ties with the Ashurian Empire but is neutral in standing. Though it 
has a population of only 2000+, it has a very powerful military and thus 
is considered a possible threat to the Ashurians.

6. Meta Suits

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Oriax (Pilot: Yumi)
The Oriax is one of the most powerful Meta Suits ever created. It was 
originally designed as a counterpart to the Raum, but gained its own 
priority in the eyes of Protocol. When the entity Seraphiel was 
discovered in the Ancient Ruins, it was imprisoned inside of the Oriax, 
giving it great powers that far surpassed Meta Suits of that time. 
However they saw that that power was too great, and so placed restraints 
on Seraphiel, weakening the Oriax in power. Geist Fahlem, one of the men 
behind the creation of the Oriax, programmed a derider into the systems 
of the machine in case the pilot (who he knew would be Yumi) ever needed 
the full power of the suit. Because the Soul Gear Engine works in 
tantamount with Seraphiel, the inner creature&#39;s power can be manipulated 
without it gaining full control over the suit. But this is only a 
temporary solution. When Seraphiel&#39;s powers are unleashed 
(Transmutation) the suit takes on a form known as Demiurge. When smaller 
portions of Seraphiel&#39;s powers are used, the suit is called Meta Oriax.

7. Details 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Astaroth
The &#39;Original Evil&#39; or the &#39;First Devil&#39;. The Astaroth was a 
manifestation of the evil that took shape because of the Second Sin. 
Though it committed no overall horrors in its time of life, it is seen 
by the ancient humans as a sinful and vile force. When the Astaroth and 
the Novus Deus met, it triggered the death (some might say 
self-destruction) of the Astaroth, which then divided itself into two 
forms. The legacy of the Astaroth hangs darkly over the world. 

- Corpse of the Astaroth: The body of the Astaroth, one of its forms 
after death. It was buried under the ice of the Antarctic and remains 
there now. 

- Heart of the Astaroth: One of the forms that Astaroth&#39;s remains took 
upon its death. This is the soul of the monster. The Heart of the 
Astaroth retains the mind of its former self, and it theorized its own 
revival. In a bid to do this, it created the Seed of the Astaroth. The 
Heart then remained on either as a non-corporeal force; one that offers 
power to Ashtars and impure members of the Novus Deus bloodline. 

- Seed of the Astaroth: The &#39;Seed&#39; of the Astaroth is the name for the 
spores it released in a bid to plot its own resurrection. These seeds 
were embedded in select members of ancient humanity and were passed down 
their bloodlines until the seed fused with their DNA. The modern day 
descendants of people infected by the Seed of the Astaroth are called 
Ashtars. 

- Ashtars: The name for a descendant of a human infected by the Seed of 
the Astaroth. They have the ability to become synonymous with the Heart 
of the Astaroth.

- Divine Hibernation/Periodic Phase Sealing Phenomenon: This is the 
result of an Ashtar whose achieved symbiosis with the Heart of the 
Astaroth. They will seal themselves inside a Qi egg for a brief period 
of time. If they do it when their powers reach a maximum then they will 
hibernate for an extended period of time. Divine Hibernation can only 
occur once the user undergoes a serious mental surge. 

- Demi-Gnosis: The first level of Gnosis. Once a person undergoes Divine 
Hibernation, they are given all new powers which can range from 
increased Qi level to an extended lifespan of even a new level of wisdom 
and perception. However the level of Demi-Gnosis is still seen as an 
&#39;incomplete&#39; one. 

- Complete Gnosis: The maximum level of Gnosis. One becomes enhanced in 
almost every possible way. For example, only Ishtars, those who attained 
Complete Gnosis, are able to leap between dimensions without internal 
ushering from the dimension&#39;s creative or managerial  source (I.e. The 
Triad of the Inquisition, Bahaman). Only a few people have ever reached 
this level, the two most noteworthy being Geist Fahlem and Ashura. 

- Ishtars: A name given to Ashtars who attain Complete Gnosis. 

Novus Deus/Hashabnah 
The original organism that descended from space to the world and 
breathed new life into it. Though both Protocolians and Ashurians call 
it &#39;Novus Deus&#39; its true name is Hashabnah. It is a Messiah whose planet 
was destroyed by climate-changes and geological instability. When its 
sensed that Earth was lacking a Messiah (Seraphiel being imprisoned at 
that time) it came down to the planet to give it new life. It is the 
centre point of the entire Messiah Series scenario. No one besides 
Seraphiel Incarnate knows the Novus Deus&#39; true origins or what it looks 
like, but its importance and legacy shines through each era. It gave 
birth to the Bio-System and oversaw life for the brief time of the Seven 
Keys, until the Second Sin was committed. This provoked the death of the 
Novus Deus. Upon its death the Novus Deus&#39; corpse was divided into two 
forms known as the Eros and Thanatos. They are destined to mate every 
148 years for the revival of the Novus Deus, until the bloodline is 
rendered &#39;pure&#39; and a successful birth takes place.

- Eros and Thanatos: The two life forms created from the remains of the 
Novus Deus after its death. They start out as embryonic forms that 
remain in stasis for 130 years. After which they begin to develop. On 
their eighteenth birthday, they are destined to mate. A birth is almost 
instantaneous; however if the bloodline is still impure, a fake god or 
Vulnus Deus will be born. The Vulnus Deus will soon afterwards crumble 
and then turn into two embryos, which will evolve into the next Eros and 
Thanatos of the following generation. This cycle will continue until a 
Novus Deus is born. Eros and Thanatos, although not Ashtars, have the 
power to achieve Gnosis (if their bloodline is still impure). 

- Vulnus Deus: An imperfect God, one created by the Eros and Thanatos 
after mating. It will then break itself down into the embryonic forms of 
the future Eros and Thanatos. 

Seraphiel 
The true Messiah of the Earth, Seraphiel is an entity that took shape in 
the planet more than 2,000,000,000 years ago, long before either Novus 
Deus or Astaroth came about. It was sealed inside the Earth&#39;s core 
during a climate disruption and thus imprisoned in stasis until its 
energy was awoken by the birth of the Novus Deus. It took another 6000+ 
years for it to be discovered by Protocolian scientists. They then 
compressed its existence and placed it inside the Oriax. When the 
Oriax&#39;s Demiurge form was activated in the battle with Freeman and the 
Raum, the Seraphiel regained its consciousness. It remained inside the 
Oriax, waiting until it was strong enough to gain an incarnation.  Its 
will now is only to destroy humanity and the Novus Deus 

Bio-System
The original organism to be spawned from the first Novus Deus. It was 
alike a biological computer, with an insatiable need to assimilate 
information. Eventually, once it gained the knowledge to do so, its form 
divided into smaller beings which are now known as mankind. 

Interlink
The psychological connection that existed between the minds of humanity 
after it separated from the Bio-System form.  It allowed data to be 
interchanged and shared between everyone. When one woman tried to 
monopolize this data for herself, it resulted in the destruction of the 
Interlink, causing the subsequent death of the Novus Deus. 

Qi
The life-force of all living things. Everything that exists possesses it 
to a certain degree, but it is stronger in some than most (like Ashura, 
Rain/Deathcatcher, Yumi, Freeman, etc). 
 
Meta Suits 
Gigantic mechanical/bio-mechanical suits of armour used in either battle 
or construction. There are three types of Meta Suits; construction, 
military, and marionette. Military-grade Meta Suits come under many 
types, all of which come under one of two categories, mass-production 
(Zagan, Amon, Uvall) or custom (Oriax, Bahamut). Certain combat suits 
are built with Qi Generators, allowing the power of the user to enhanced 
the capabilities of the suit itself. 

The Tablets of Destiny
Ancient tablets written by the old race of humans, the first to 
originate from the Novus Deus. The tablets detail the events after the 
birth and death of the Novus Deus, and the prophesies that the ancients 
had about the future. They were discovered in 2103 within the Ancient 
Ruins, 28 years after the Ancient Ruins had been exposed by Protocolian 
submarines. There are eighty-six discovered tablets, and two of the 
tablets happen to be; 

- Sepher Yetzirah: Which deals with the prophecy of the Five Ages. 
- Asch Metzereph: Which details the Astaroth and its overall legacy, as 
well as the legend of the Three Stars. 

The Seven Keys
This is the term used to describe the final seven days of the Bythos 
Period, the time between the arrival of the Novus Deus and its death. 

The Five Ages/Second Cycle
A concept of the Sepher Yetzirah tablet, one that believes that the 
world will be subject to five overall ages, varying in length. This will 
only take place if the 41st Union between Eros and Thanatos (the final 
union of the Sermo period) is unsuccessful. These ages are;

- 1. Bythos: The time from the beginning of the universe to the Seven 
Keys. 
- 2. Nous: Everything from the Seven Keys up to 2005. 
- 3. Sermo: Everything from 2005 to 2153.
- 4. Anthropos: From 2153 onward, following Deathcatcher&#39;s destruction 
of the world. 
- 5. Synesis: The age at which Novus Deus returns to the world after 
successful conception between an Eros and Thanatos (yet to be decided). 

Ragnarok System
A gigantic computer structure created by Protocol at the same time as 
they created Meshezabel. It runs on four smaller ones (Genesis, 
Leviticus, Deuteronomy and Exodus) connected together. The Ragnarok 
System was originally created for the mass-production of Marionettes, as 
a way to control marionettes all over the globe in one place. However 
this changed after the Grand Cataclysm, and the Ragnarok System was 
thereafter used to control and monitor computers all over the world. It 
takes a special hacker or scientist to program something that cannot be 
controlled or detected by the Ragnarok System. When Meta Suits are 
linked to the Ragnarok System, it manipulates brain waves to improve the 
performance of the pilots.  

The Elymus Drive
A key component of the many defences of Meshezabel. It amplifies force 
projections from cannons and Meta Suits and scrambles their power into 
billions of separated beams which attack multiple points over a specific 
area. This was the same machine that Deathcatcher used, in conjunction 
with the Diablos, to destroy both the nation of Xu and the Sermo period 
civilization (thus ushering in the Anthropos era). 

The Second Sin
When the Interlink was destroyed by a single person, this was the name 
that was given to the act. It is the first overall evil act, and the 
energy created from that act resulted in the birth of the Astaroth. It 
is called the &#39;Second Sin&#39; because Sermo period philosophers held it in 
the same regard as the Original Sin (Eve). 

The Great War
The nuclear war that began with conflict between Iran and America, which 
then spilt out over the world until it became a fully fledged battle 
between the West and the Middle East. This war killed many people on 
Earth and is seen as the first great event of the Sermo Period. 

Ark of the Luria 
The denomination of Christianity that was created by Father Bartholomeus 
when he retreated from secular life to life on EDEN. It teaches peace 
and unity. 

The Great Schism 
The name for the divide of the Protocol organization and the subsequent 
war between the two factions that formed as a result (New Protocol - led 
by Celaph, and the Holy Empire of Protocol - led by Princess Ashura and 
the Triad of the Inquisition). The Great Schism ended when the Divine 
Cataclysm took place. 

The Divine Cataclysm
One of many names given to the event that ended the Sermo period and 
hailed the beginning of the Anthropos era. Deathcatcher and his Meta 
Suit, the Diablos, entered Meshezabel and activated the Elymus Drive, 
destroying the Sermo civilization and killing over two billion people.  

Soul Gear Engine 
When an operating system and Qi Generator of a certain Meta Suit are 
linked together, they become known as a Soul Gear Engine. The existence 
of a Soul Gear Engine in a Meta Suit allows for better control over the 
Qi-flow of the body and generator. 

Spectral Circuit 
Another name for the operating system of a Meta Suit. 

Derider 
An invention of Geist Fahlem&#39;s. It is a program which has the ability to 
override other programs designed into Meta Suits and computer systems. 

Security Demon
Randomly coded security programs to detect criminal activity in a 
computer server. 

Counter Demon Wall
A program created by Yumi to disguise downloading from a Security Demon. 

Gospel Template
The uniform name for the interconnected computers and electronic systems 
which come under the jurisdiction of the Ragnarok System. Examples of 
things which run under the Gospel Template are Tigris, Metatron, the 
Initiative Trigger, etc. 

Initiative Trigger
The name for the computer program which the Marionettes run on via the 
Ragnarok System. 

Elohim Program
The program that operates the Kaiser Halberds. 

Chuggers
Meta Suit-like bipedal machines used for construction and excavation. 

Katarium
The chemical name for hardened Qi energy. 

The Cradle of the Second Genesis
Another name for the world created by the Divine Cataclysm. 

Xu-Canaan War
The war that the nations of Xu and Canaan fought against the Ashurian 
Empire. It came to a head when Deathcatcher destroyed Xu, transforming 
it into the Islands of Baan. It was the only great resistance to 
Ashurian rule. 

Bio Rhythm
A name for the effort by which the body operates with Qi energy. 

Psycho Borders
The name for mental strength. 

Kaiser Halberd/Counter Kaiser Halberd 
Also known as Wechselhaft Zerst&#148;rung Klinge Gewehr (Variable Destruction 
Blade Rifle), these are two weapons created as replicas of the Arrow of 
Seraphiel. The formal plans for them were developed by Diana Katrianna 
but their making took place in the St. Mary&#39;s Base and Command Central. 
The Kaiser Halberds have two modes of being. 

- Disruptor Expansion Sword Mode: The Kaiser Halberd&#39;s casing opens all 
the way transforming it into a sword-shaped state. 

- Disruptor Rail Gun Mode: The projectile attack of the Kaiser Halberds. 
The casing moves back half way and alters itself into a Rail Gun. Its 
energy is extremely potent. 

The Arrow of Seraphiel
The legendary weapon of Seraphiel, a spear which was said to transform 
into a bolt of light to smite the enemies of the Earth. In the Scroll of 
Sariel it is stated that the Arrow of Seraphiel will take on many forms 
until the time comes for it to be wielded by the Incarnation. 

Metatron 
The super-computer of Aryahm/Command Central and a key component of the 
Gospel Template. The Central Data Banks of the city are stored in it, 
which monitors deaths, births, the influx of immigrants, crime levels, 
etc. 

The Source
The &#39;Source&#39; is the gateway into the domain of Seraphiel that was 
uncovered in 2143 AD. It was sealed inside the domain that Bahaman 
rules, Geshem, by the Triad of the Inquisition (it was placed there when 
it seemed that there was no other way to keep Seraphiel from returning) 
after they discovered the Scroll of Sariel.

Tigris
The super-computer of the South Shidou Investigative Research Station 
that acts as a part of the Gospel Template. 

Scroll of Sariel 
An ancient scroll documenting the legacy of Seraphiel and prophesising 
its reincarnation into the world. It was discovered by John James in the 
Sermo era and later fell into the hands of Diana Katrianna, who made a 
copy of it and destroyed the original. 

The Sohei Project
A project formulated by Diana and Gustav K&#148;hler, but for different 
purposes. The general view was that it was a plan to create a 
super-trained army out of the Schutzenreich by using muscle enhancers 
and chemical/mental treatments. However Diana and the Ministry of 
Metaphysical and Biotechnological Neo-Eugenic Research did more than 
that for the Sohei Project. They cloned ancient warriors of the old ears 
and re-wrote the memories of those clones to mask that fact. The 
Ministry then went on to make genetic copies of the brains of average 
Meta Suit pilots for the Stolas Marionettes. In reality, the Sohei 
Project was an undercover means of Diana researching into and producing 
an army for Seraphiel&#39;s Incarnation. 

Messiahs 
All-powerful creatures spawned from the core of planets to act as 
overseers. Novus Deus/Hashabnah and Seraphiel are both Messiahs.   

The Three Stars 
A prophecy of the Asch Metzereph tablet. It states that three people or 
&#39;stars&#39; known as De Caelo (on the heavens), De Anima (on the soul), and 
De Mundo (on the world) will guide the world through the Anthropos era. 
The three stars are Yumi (who is De Mundo), Ashura (who is De Caelo) and 
Deathcatcher (who is De Anima). The nature by which the three will 
&#39;guide&#39; the world is unknown. 

The Offerings 
It was theorized by the Triad of the Inquisition that each of the middle 
generations of the world (Nous, Anthropos and Sermo) would have to 
supplement the spirit of the Novus Deus with &#39;offerings&#39; of penance 
through bloodshed to bring about the Synesis period. Those supposed 
offerings are; 

- The First Offering: The First World War (Nous) 
- The Second Offering: The Divine Cataclysm (Sermo)
- The Third Offering: Yet to be decided (Anthropos)
