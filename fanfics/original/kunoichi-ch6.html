Shinrin Jinja

The Room of Fates was not empty when Ryoko entered it; but her 
condition did have a heavy ring. Loud enough to catch the 
attention of more than one person there. A flash of pink soon 
blurred into sight in the large main room of the Shinrin Jinja. 
It materialized as the so-called &#39;Imageless&#39; Kunoichi; Ryoko. 
The girl landed swiftly to the smooth wooden floorboards of the 
shrine room; her sandals clacking down and her blonde ponytail 
waving behind her. She had managed to escape death from Shiki, 
but not without harm. Her Chi was dreadfully low. Maintaining 
that fog was very difficult. And it gets even more difficult as 
fights drag out. All of her kunai had been expended and most of 
all... she failed her mission. Just like Zanmaru had done. But 
unlike Zanmaru... Ryoko had managed to keep her life. If not for 
making the  quick escape when that she did, she probably would 
have been killed just like he was. 

Ryoko kneeled to the floorboard ground and took a deep breath. 
She felt so tired. But it wasn&#39;t like she didn&#39;t have any reason 
to be. Not only was her Chi heavily exhausted but teleporting 
from Ichijiteki Park to the Shinrin Jinja was a taxing ability. 
It made her even more tired than she felt. But she wasn&#39;t alone 
in the Room of Fates. The older man who happened to be there as 
well walked up to the kneeling kunoichi. She knew that it was 
Hirotsugu but she did not want him to be. He would know that... 
she failed her mission...

Hirotsugu&#39;s powerful dark eyes looked down at the ailing young 
woman. &quot;...Well. If it isn&#39;t the First of the Orochi, Ryoko-kun. 
I would have assumed that I would be seeing you in better shape. 
The girl of Morioka must have given you some trouble. Though I 
assume that she is dead now...?&quot;

Ryoko stood upright, her stomach squirming. She failed in that 
mission. And she was deathly afraid of what Hirotsugu&#39;s reaction 
to that might be. The Imageless Kunoichi lowered her face and 
pulled off her pink mouthpiece. Revealing her mouth, which was 
bleeding a little bit from the corner of her rosy lips. 

&quot;...I am sorry, sir...&quot; Ryoko said both fearfully and 
apologetically, &quot;...But I failed to kill the girl from Morioka. 
I tried... b-but she was lucky enough to land a blow on me 
before-&quot;

&quot;Silence!&quot;

Hirotsugu&#39;s roar echoed throughout the Room of Fates. It shut 
Ryoko right up. She clammed up and looked downwards at her tired 
feet. She felt like a little girl being scolded by her parents 
for breaking something. However that chilling fear Ryoko also 
carried far outshined her embarrassment. The last thing she 
wanted to deal with was her Lord&#39;s anger. Ironically; it was the 
thing she expected most. And she got it. In all its glory. Then 
Hirotsugu turned his back to Ryoko, lowering his heavy tone of 
voice to speak in his normal manner.

&quot;You&#39;ve said quite enough,&quot; He followed, &quot;I have no time for 
your excuses. But I have news. My plans will be realized soon. I 
have ordered the other Orochi to rope those who will stand in 
the way of these plans into submission. Odd members of 
Parliament mostly. It is high time that we got started with 
this... I have waited too long.&quot;

Ryoko brightened a little. &quot;I-I understand, sir! You wanna see 
things go well for you and your plans. After I rest and regain 
my Chi; I&#39;ll join the others in the work on the politicians. You 
can count on me. I won&#39;t let you down again.&quot;

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Hirotsugu said, sharply, &quot;Why do you not tell me, 
Ryoko-kun? If a person were to die before achieving their 
dreams... how would that person get back in order to realize 
them?&quot;

Ryoko let out a half-confused glare at the Honshu Koga. She 
really had no idea where he was going with this so just answered 
to the best of her ability. &quot;Well... a person cannot come back 
from the dead... so they cannot achieve their dream.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; The older man said, &quot;The same applies to you, little 
girl. A failure is a failure. If you have been unsuccessful once 
then there is nothing to assure me that it will not happen 
again. When you take on missions for the Koga... you have one 
option. To succeed. And if you fail... then you are worthless. 
One strike, one kill.&quot;

A quiver found its way into Ryoko&#39;s throat. Now she knew exactly 
what Hirotsugu was talking about. And it didn&#39;t spell good news 
for her. The blonde ninja stepped back in slow fear, shaking. 
&quot;P-Please, sir... I-I&#39;ve been good to you in the... p-past...&quot;

Hirotsugu looked over his shoulder at the trembling girl. &quot;The 
past is the past. All I care about are results in the here and 
now. And the fruits that these efforts will bare in the future. 
You do not understand this...? Then I will make it easier on 
you.&quot;

The Honshu Koga then looked over to the darkness around the 
close wall of Room of Fates. He nodded, as if to signal 
something. Ryoko knew that that action pretty much set up her 
death warrant. A crescent-shaped slash violently cut through the 
quiet air of that room. By the time that Ryoko even noticed it, 
her vision was turning red. The girl tightened up and collapsed 
to the ground in a heap. Her blood soon surrounded her corpse in 
a grim puddle. In one whole motion, her neck, chest and stomach 
had been sliced open vertically from her chin to her crotch. If 
anymore force was put into the strike, she would have been cut 
in half. The powerful shinobi, Yagami, landed in a crouched 
position, his large glaive crescent moon bladed glaive dirty 
with the dead Ryoko&#39;s blood. He had killed her effortlessly. 

Hirotsugu just looked over to his most trusted aide. &quot;Stupid 
child. She really was talented. It is simply a shame that she 
couldn&#39;t hone those talents to their finest edge.&quot;

&quot;Master,&quot; Yagami spoke, &quot;This woman has caused us too much 
trouble. I could find her myself and eliminate her.&quot;

The Honshu Koga shook his head. &quot;No. That would be a waste of 
your talents, Yagami-kun. I want her to come to us. For too long 
we have played under her terms. Now it&#39;s time to truly see what 
she is made of. If her intelligence is anything to go by then 
she will head for the Diet Building soon. When Mask-kun comes 
back from his &#39;errands&#39; with Setsuki-kun, I want you and he to 
go there and wait for her. It&#39;s time the girl learned her 
place.&quot;

&quot;What about Setsuki-san?&quot;

&quot;He will remain here,&quot; Hirotsugu replied, &quot;It is time we got 
started. And I cannot have that girl interfering with me 
anymore. She must die&quot;

Kimagure Gakuen

Morning had hit Tokyo.

Just like she wished, Yui had gotten home at a decent hour last 
night. Despite her fight with the First Orochi, Ryoko. As soon 
as the fight was over she left for her apartment. And after all 
the excitement with Haruko and Ryoko; it was kind of lonely 
there. But that wasn&#39;t much of a problem for Yui at that point. 
She was more concerned with what she was going to be doing about 
the Honshu Koga; Hirotsugu. The fight with the Imageless 
Kunoichi had shown that Yui couldn&#39;t put off the killing of 
Hirotsugu for long. He would keep sending more and more of the 
Orochi to kill her until she was eventually worn out. Unless she 
could get to him first. And put an end to his miserable life 
once and for all. When Yui had woken up this morning, she 
quickly got dressed and had something to eat. She didn&#39;t want to 
be late for Haruko since they were walking to school together 
(and Haruko apparently hated it when people were late). This 
morning she managed to leave on time. And she met up with Haruko 
right in front of her house. It didn&#39;t take all that much 
walking but they got to school together okay. By this time; Yui 
didn&#39;t need to be shown around the class rooms and went straight 
to her first lesson. As soon as that lesson and the second one 
were over; Yui made her apologies to Haruko and left for the 
library. Once she got there she found a quiet table for herself 
and took out a certain book. A sort of A-Z of Modern Tokyo. She 
set it down and took a seat. Her goal? To find possible places 
where that snake Hirotsugu would be hiding.

Which was what she was doing now.

Yui&#39;s soft green eyes rolled from one side of the book to the 
other. Those orbs searched and searched for something. A place 
where Hirotsugu might be hiding in. She knew that he was showy 
and stuck-up (even if he didn&#39;t always act like it) and it was 
because of this he would probably make some Tokyo landmark  his 
base of operations. All of the Koga tended to do that. Just as 
they tended to stick to the major city of their respective 
islands. The Hokkaido Koga lived in Sapporo, the Shikoku Koga 
lived in Matsuyama, and the Kyushu Koga lived in Fukuoka. The 
only reason that Yui knew this however; was because of the 
information given to her by her employer. But even she didn&#39;t 
know exactly where the Honshu Koga resided. Such details were 
top secret; even in the underworld. It was part of her job (or 
moreover, that of Shiki) to find these details. But finding out 
where the Honshu Koga was living was going to be harder than she 
first thought. In more ways than one. Two days ago; it wouldn&#39;t 
have mattered what happened or who came after her, Six Orochi or 
not. But Yui now had Haruko to think about. She had made a good 
friend out of Uchida Haruko and Yui didn&#39;t want to risk losing 
that. Especially so early on in their acquaintance. She had to 
bring to a prompt end to  Hirotsugu before Haruko got sucked 
into any of it. Because not only did she have a probing 
political mind, the class representative had already been 
targeted by the Six Orochi. Though Zanmaru had probably thought 
of Haruko as nothing more than target practice at the time; it 
showed that the Orochi had no qualms in killing people who 
weren&#39;t even involved in their business. 

Yui, with the intimidating presence of Shiki watching over her, 
had to take a stand against the Six Orochi and kill Hirotsugu. 
The question was, however... where the hell was he? 

The Morioka girl scanned over her A-Z book map of Tokyo. Still 
searching for places in town that Hirotsugu might be calling 
home. There had to be somewhere special in this city that he was 
working from. Yui flicked over a page and kept looking. Classes 
started again in about five minutes so she didn&#39;t have much time 
for this. It would have been better to do this sort of thing at 
home; but Yui was too consumed with figuring out the mystery to 
care about location. And Yui was so caught up in her work that 
she barely noticed someone approaching her.

&quot;So...&quot; A small hand was slapped on the table to gain Yui&#39;s 
attention, &quot;Here you are. I&#39;ve been looking all over for you, 
Yui-san.&quot;

Yui blinked and looked upwards from the map. &quot;...H-Haruko-san?&quot;

&quot;Yes, who did you think it was?&quot; The short-haired blonde 
replied, &quot;But never mind all of that. Have your heard the news?&quot;

&quot;What news?&quot; Yui questioned. 

Haruko shook her head and pulled something from under her right 
arm. It was a newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun. Haruko presented it 
to the girl with surprised eyes. On it was a very blunt and 
eye-catching headline, entitled &#39;Butchered&#39;. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we 
just found out about it now. Sakamoto Gendo was murdered last 
night.&quot;

Yui blinked, and grabbed the newspaper, looking down on the 
front page of it. Before she even read it she asked Haruko what 
was buzzing around in her head. &quot;Who on earth is Sakamoto 
Gendo?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you know?&quot; Haruko shook her head again, &quot;Sakamoto Gendo 
was a popular member of the Kokkai. Sakamoto-san was one of a 
small number of politicians with pro-socialist views; since most 
of the cabinet are conservative. He even supported that failed 
bill for legalized same-sex marriage a couple years back. But 
last night his wife found him beheaded in the living room of his 
home in the early hours of the morning. But the weirdest thing 
is; his body was also covered in sheets of ice. Nobody can 
explain it.&quot;

A chill passed down Yui&#39;s spine. Nobody else could figure it 
out. But Yui could. She had only met three of the Six Orochi. 
Zanmaru, Setsuki (for a brief moment) and Ryoko. Only Zanmaru 
and Setsuki had any affinity with the elements (Zanmaru was 
linked with Lightning, Setsuki with Wind). So it was obvious 
that another member of the Orochi had killed this politician. 
The Six Orochi had struck again. And this time they had taken 
someone in the public eye. But for what reason? Surely then 
couldn&#39;t need to kill a member of Parliament. The Four Koga 
already had a stranglehold on Japanese Politics. Their powers 
were not... absolute, but still...

Yui felt herself becoming more serious. &quot;...What does 
Fujiwara-sama say about this?&quot; 

&quot;Prime Minister Fujiwara?&quot; Haruko held a hand to her chin, 
&quot;Well, naturally, the article says that he&#39;s shocked and 
saddened by the killing. But he apparently didn&#39;t have much else 
to say on the matter. That&#39;s just typical, isn&#39;t it? 
Conservatives are always so cagey when it comes to issues like 
this one.&quot;

But Yui knew better than that. If Fujiwara wasn&#39;t talking it was 
because he couldn&#39;t. Spineless as he was; Fujiwara wasn&#39;t 
stupid. He had to be aware of the fact that it was the Six 
Orochi who had done this. Probably under Hirotsugu&#39;s command. He 
was probably frightened for his own life. As much as others 
would be. 

Yui looked over at Haruko again when she remembered something. 
&quot;Hey... Haruko-san. You said that this guy was a kind of 
liberalist, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Haruko nodded to confirm it, &quot;He was a rare breed in 
this day and age. Why?&quot; 

&quot;N-No reason...&quot; But in truth, she did have her reasons. The 
Morioka girl sighed at this. She was beginning to understand 
what was going on here. Intimidation. Sakamoto was just meant as 
an example. To wordlessly threaten those other members of the 
cabinet who just might be willing enough to question one of the 
Four Koga. Parliament was very important to the Koga; whether 
they liked to believe it or not. Because most of the Japanese 
people were completely in the dark about the Koga. Without the 
public image of congress (of which people were familiar with and 
knowledgeable about) the Four Koga couldn&#39;t employ any of the 
powers they had gained from the economic crisis years back. In 
that sense; the Four Koga were not all powerful. But because so 
many members of Parliament were either in the pocket of the Koga 
or too spineless to take a stand, opposition to their plans came 
very rarely. And only by those who felt their lives were worth 
less than the intrinsic right of freedom for Japanese politics. 
Sakamoto Gendo was one of those people. Now he was dead. Which 
was sure to spread a fresh wave of fear throughout the 
government. 

Yui didn&#39;t know how this was going to affect her shot at 
Hirotsugu, but it couldn&#39;t have come at a more awkward time. The 
Honshu Koga was bound to be more alert than ever. Which was 
probably one of the reasons he wanted Yui out of the way. He was 
obviously planning to do something big. Something that required 
the intimidation and silence of those who might try to stand 
against it. 

But it did give Yui one fresh clue.

Whatever Hirotsugu was up to, it clearly involved something 
political. This was a sure thing by now. And if Yui was going to 
find out more about the location of Hirotsugu; she would have to 
go to the one person in Parliament whom had more contact with 
the Honshu Koga than anyone else. That was Prime Minister 
Fujiwara. And where else would she be able to reach him...? None 
other than the very hub of Japanese politics. 

...The National Diet Building.
