<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 44 of 46)</h1>

<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch43.html">Back to Part 43</a><pre>      Hoshi had already been awake since dawn, but she couldn&#39;t find the energy to get up. 
Guilt was weighing her down and she wondered how her sisters felt. The three of them had 
always been together and now... It was then that she prepared herself to leave the room, 
thinking only of her sisters. They needed her - whether they needed her to be angry at or to 
be comforted by didn&#39;t matter.

      She dressed into the clothes left for her and walked down the hall with a great deal 
of apprehension. Hoshi didn&#39;t know her way around the house at all, but followed the 
delicious scent of breakfast that she first noticed in her room 40 minutes ago. She soon 
found herself in the kitchen, a bit perplexed. So much for showing up in the dining room...

      Eveon came back in to the kitchen and jumped out of reflex. &quot;You scared me,&quot; she said 
with a grin, going over to some of the pans to check on the food. &quot;Do you want anything?&quot;

      Hoshi shook her head silently. &quot;I...&quot; She sat down on a stool by the counter. &quot;I need 
to speak with Hina and Tsuki, but I...&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t know where to start?&quot; Eveon finished the sentence for her. &quot;Hina is eating at 
the table and she seems perfectly fine. Tsuki... didn&#39;t look well. She left her food on the 
table and went outside, so...&quot;

      Hoshi nodded, getting up. &quot;I could... go talk to Hina first, then take Tsuki&#39;s food to 
her as an excuse...?&quot;

      Eveon gave her a thumbs up and Hoshi couldn&#39;t quite understand the kindness that was 
being displayed to her. &quot;Don&#39;t you... think I&#39;m horrible?&quot;

      The blonde girl immediately shook her head. &quot;No - there are plenty of worse people. I 
mean, sure you had some desires that you should have talked to your sisters about instead of 
bottling it up... but that doesn&#39;t make you bad.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; Hoshi said, before stepping outside of the kitchen and to the dining 
room.

      Everyone immediately looked up when she arrived and Hoshi wanted to crawl back into 
the kitchen to ask Eveon if she could hide in the pantry. Krystal, Isaka and Tsuru were 
eating and talking amongst themselves as Tycara tried to convince Seth to feed her. Bakra 
and Josh were trying to figure out how Eveon prepared the food and Hina...

      With eyes currently all on her, Hoshi&#39;s confidence faltered. It wasn&#39;t until she heard 
the slight screech of a chair and saw beautiful hazel eyes that she remembered why she came 
out of the kitchen in the first place. &quot;Big sister!&quot;

      Hina almost tackled the silver haired woman in a fierce hug. At that moment, everyone 
at the table exchanged glances. They abruptly got up with their plates and shuffled over to 
the living room, chattering about watching the news.

      Hoshi froze up at the feeling of her younger sister pressed up against her, her 
forehead fitting perfectly against the hollow of Hoshi&#39;s shoulder. When her brain finally 
turned back on, she pushed her sister away, keeping her hands on Hina&#39;s shoulders. &quot;G-good 
morning, Hina.&quot;

      The blonde girl seemed shocked and disgruntled at the sudden loss of contact. With a 
determined face, she embraced her sister again. &quot;Big sister... you&#39;ve always been pushing us 
away,&quot; Hina whispered. &quot;You never let us see your emotions.&quot;

      Hoshi was quiet. &quot;Because it was better that way... or at least... I didn&#39;t want you 
to know what I&#39;d become inside - that your precious big sister was just a... a...&quot;

      Hina shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t care. I love you the way you are and I forgive you 
because I know it hurt you to do those things just as much as it hurt me. So please, don&#39;t 
push me aside.&quot;

      &quot;Hina...&quot; Hoshi quietly held her sister as well. &quot;I don&#39;t deserve your kindness...&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Hina pulled back a little bit, a blush streaking across her face. &quot;I like 
you a lot, big sister.&quot;

      Hoshi felt her body get hot and that seed of desire that she thought she destroyed 
roared back to life. The urge to hold Hina close and give her little kisses was so 
overwhelming-

      She let go of Hina and turned away from that cute face. This... wasn&#39;t the time for 
her to misconstruing her sister&#39;s kindness. &quot;Thank you, Hina... but... I think I need to 
talk to Tsuki.&quot;

      Hina nodded happily. &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll follow you out in a bit, okay?&quot;

      Hoshi stumbled a bit on her way to the patio. Luckily, it was close by, but she took a 
minute to clear the light headedness from her brain. Had that really just happened? She was 
sure she must be dreaming... with much hesitation, she opened the glass door and headed 
outside.

      Under normal circumstances, Tsuki should have noticed her. Hoshi took a breathe of 
deep air before sitting down on the edge of the patio, a good foot away from where her 
sister was. Tsuki suddenly noticed her and jerked away instinctively.

      &quot;...Tsuki, I know there is nothing I can say to-&quot;

      &quot;Please, please don&#39;t,&quot; the younger girl choked out. &quot;I really don&#39;t want to... to 
talk about this right now.&quot;

      Hoshi was silent, trying to think of something to do. &quot;I&#39;ve violated you and taken 
away your chance at an innocent life... I just... I was too selfish to try and fix it. I 
shouldn&#39;t have let it grow out of proportion because it was my fault that we got used.&quot;

      Tsuki suddenly got up, with the intent of leaving. However, her head throbbed 
violently and she had to immediately sit back down with a pained groan. It was then that 
Hoshi suddenly felt the overwhelming presence of holy power coming from her sister. For a 
moment, she forgot all about her promise to not touch her sisters.

      &quot;Tsuki!&quot; She called out and went to her side. &quot;Your power... it&#39;s going out of 
control, isn&#39;t it?&quot; The girl was in too much pain to nod.

      Hoshi grabbed Tsuki&#39;s left arm and began to examine it. Even the seals all over her 
arm didn&#39;t seem to be stopping it... Hoshi began to massage it meticulously, trying her 
hardest to pinpoint the problem spots and release the pent up holy power in her sister&#39;s 
body.

      Tsuki tried to struggle until Hoshi told her to stop, in a very firm, commanding tone. 
So she stopped. The brunette let out groans as the pain started to ebb away slowly and she 
stole a look at her sister. Hoshi&#39;s face was calm, determined on the task at hand.

      It reminded the brunette so much more of their times before the Demon Lord, when Hoshi 
watched over them like a kind hawk, allaying each one of their fears and worries. Anytime 
she or Hina were miserable, it was Hoshi that held them, Hoshi that whispered sweet things 
to banish those doubts.

      But it was also Hoshi who ripped away her innocence and it was Hoshi that showed her 
the world was a cesspool of depravity. Tsuki started to cry as all the pain left her.

      &quot;...why didn&#39;t you wait?&quot;

      Hoshi looked up, her mask of concentration broken.

      &quot;I asked you to wait, but why didn&#39;t you?!&quot; Tsuki was bawling now, tears running down 
her face. &quot;That night, I asked you, but you didn&#39;t wait!&quot;

      Hoshi was silent. Should she embrace her sister and calm her fears...? Or keep away to 
not upset her? The debate only lasted for a few seconds before Hoshi held Tsuki close to 
her. This wasn&#39;t the time to worry about her perverse lust - she had to comfort Tsuki when 
she needed it most.

      Wasn&#39;t that what she was supposed to do as her big sister?

      The silver haired woman slowly rocked back in forth, whispering words into Tsuki&#39;s 
ears that would calm her down. Tsuki was once again swept up in the nostalgia of it all. She 
wished for nothing more than for the same maternal comfort that only Hoshi could give her.

      After a few more minutes, Tsuki spoke again. &quot;My shameful body... is always such a 
traitor...&quot;

      Hoshi looked down at her sister, but Tsuki was turned away, her right cheek pushed up 
against her big sister&#39;s bosom. &quot;I could... I could have been a great exorcist like you, 
even surpassed you... I wanted to be better so I could help you.&quot;

      She clenched her fist of her still aching right arm. &quot;But my body wouldn&#39;t allow it. I 
had so much power that I couldn&#39;t even control...! I just ended up being  a burden to you, 
to Hina, because you had to care for me and make sure I didn&#39;t get ill. You even... you even 
stopped your studies for a whole year just to find a way to keep my power in check.&quot;

      &quot;Tsuki... I couldn&#39;t stand by and let you suffer when I could help you.&quot;

      &quot;I know... but then... it happened again that night. My body betrayed me... when you 
came to me that night, I didn&#39;t understand and I needed time and I... I... my disgusting 
body gave in and then the curse had me. I tried so hard,&quot; Tsuki whispered. &quot;So hard to break 
free, but every time you and Hina touched me... I... couldn&#39;t help myself.&quot;

      Hoshi froze up and slowly pushed her sister away so she could look at her. &quot;Tsuki... 
what are you talking about...?&quot;

      Her sister looked very much like a guilty child, the tears having dried up and a red 
blush adorning her face. &quot;...I thought you... knew. Hina and I... we... when you did things 
to us, we...&quot; She bit her lip. &quot;Because it gave us pleasure and made us... realize a 
d-desire we never knew about... the curse got increasingly stronger...&quot;

      Hoshi took a long time to process it. The real reason her sisters became obedient to 
the curse was because of the desire they felt when she...?

      &quot;I know it&#39;s wrong to feel that way and you&#39;re both my sisters, but my body - it just 
wouldn&#39;t stop liking it even though i-it&#39;s disgusting and-&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s alright, Tsuki,&quot; Hoshi said cutting her off. &quot;It&#39;s alright... I... know that you 
know your big sister isn&#39;t pure...&quot;

      The two slowly broke away from each other to sit up. &quot;But you can have all the time in 
the world,&quot; Hoshi murmured. &quot;I will wait, even if I&#39;m waiting for nothing.&quot;

      &quot;Big sister...&quot; Tsuki whispered, wiping at her eyes.

      It was then that Hina came outside, after watching the spectacle of her two sisters 
making up. She figured this should be correct time and she had in her hands a plate of food 
and couple of drinks. Hoshi and Tsuki were startled at her sudden appearance.

      &quot;Is... everything okay now?&quot; Hina asked as she sat down in the convenient empty spot 
between her two sisters.

      Hoshi nodded slowly. &quot;For... the most part, I think, if you two think... that we could 
start over?&quot;

      Tsuki nodded as well and Hina only smiled. &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; the little girl said. &quot;It&#39;s 
nice that we&#39;re all back together.&quot;

      She handed out the drinks and some of the food. Suddenly, Hina interrupted the quiet 
mood. &quot;Neh... big sister... if we&#39;re starting over... does that mean we&#39;ll go back to the 
way we were?&quot;

      &quot;Yes... I know that&#39;s what... you two want, right? If... if you don&#39;t want me around-&quot;

      Tsuki interrupted her. &quot;No! ...I mean, how are we going to get over this if we can&#39;t 
do it together. I want us... to be sisters again...&quot;

      They all settled down and continued eating in silence. Hina watched a few birds play 
in the outskirts of the backyard leading into the forest before voicing a question that had 
been bothering her. &quot;If we&#39;re starting over as sisters, does that still mean we have a 
chance at being lovers?&quot;

      Hoshi presumed to spew her orange juice all over the yard as Tsuki choked on a piece 
of toast. Hina swallowed uncomfortably. Maybe... maybe that was a little too blunt...? Tsuki 
downed her whole entire cup of hot tea to clear the crumbs from her throat while Hoshi 
proceeded to stare at Hina as though she&#39;d grown a pair of horns-

      The silver haired woman stopped that imagery in its tracks before it could instill 
into her head another... fantasy, for lack of a better term. &quot;H-Hina... did you just...?&quot;

      &quot;I know I&#39;m young, but... I... I know what I want. I want to be with you and Tsuki, 
but... but as lovers. I like it when you touch me,&quot; she trailed off, blushing and directing 
her gaze at the birds, pretending not to see Hoshi&#39;s flabbergasted expression.

      &quot;B-b-but Hina,&quot; Tsuki started. &quot;Aren&#39;t you... disgusted by it?!&quot;

      &quot;No... I love you both so much that it doesn&#39;t bother me,&quot; she said, giving the 
brunette and big smile. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want anyone else to touch me.&quot;

      Tsuki held her head in her hands, trying to keep her traitorous body from reaching out 
to embrace her cute little sister-

      Hoshi was looking up at the sky, still quite sure it was a dream. Hina let out a long 
sigh at both of her sister&#39;s apparent shocked states. She swirled her cup of milk with a 
frown. &quot;...I guess it&#39;s easy to tell we&#39;re related...&quot;

      At least, if there was any indication from both of her sisters&#39; reactions.
