5:45 am

 

&quot;This is so cool,&quot; Jill Haynes hissed. &quot;I had no idea you two were this 
devious.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not,&quot; Mary Belfiske insisted, creeping closer to the building. 
&quot;This is the right course of action. We&#39;re on a mission of goodwill and 
justice.&quot;

&quot;Plus it gives us an excuse to slink around wearing ninja clothes,&quot; 
Jerry Belfiske whispered, concealing a smile behind his facemask. The 
three of them were as shadows, shrouded in the dark on a covert mission 
to acquire secret knowledge. They knew it was dangerous, and they were 
pretty sure they were breaking at least two laws, but the risk made 
everything more exciting and significant. Carefully, the three friends 
sidled against the outer wall, snuck underneath the window, and oh so 
carefully, took Dean Rosewood&#39;s master key out and unlocked it. Jill was 
the first to slither in, since she was the skinniest and the quietest; 
next came Jerry, and Mary at the rear, keeping the window open a crack. 
According to their calculations and &quot;inside information&quot;, the target 
would be three rooms down, and more importantly, nobody would interrupt 
them for five minutes.

&quot;No talking, now,&quot; Jill warned them. She peered out of the room, gave a 
thumbs-up, and ushered her friends down the hall. They heard someone 
coming and scattered like mice, each one finding a bathroom to hide in. 
Once the coast was clear, they returned to their work, and finally found 
the room they were looking for. Plastered on the door in firm, gold and 
black letters was the name H. FITZGERALD. Mary carefully opened her 
compact and used its mirror to peer inside. Jerry and Jill were relieved 
when she flashed the thumbs-up. One turn of the master key, and they 
were inside.

&quot;Quickly, now,&quot; Jerry whispered, glancing at his wristwatch. &quot;Only two 
minutes left.&quot;

&quot;Clear,&quot; Mary whispered, giving her team updates on the hallway. Jill 
took longer than they expected to locate the information, despite how 
tidy and organized everything was, and by the time she found it, Mary 
was giving them the &quot;move out&quot; signal.

&quot;One second! I can&#39;t read his handwriting!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t disturb it! He can&#39;t know we were in here! Here, let me take a 
look. You get out of here.&quot;

&quot;Enemy approaching,&quot; Mary hissed in a panic. &quot;Target ETA forty-five 
seconds! No, wait- he&#39;s busy talking to someone! His back is turned! Go, 
go, go!&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Jill blurted, taking a quick picture of the info with her cell 
phone. The three of them made tracks: Jill, Jerry, and Mary at the rear, 
making sure they were covered until they returned to the entry point. 
They shut the door just as someone was coming round the hallway, slipped 
back out the window, locked it, and didn&#39;t relax until they put some 
serious distance behind them.

&quot;Good Lord, that took days off my life!&quot; Jerry exclaimed as he removed 
his face mask. &quot;But I gotta admit, that was fun! Let&#39;s see it, Jill.&quot;

&quot;Good thing they figured out how to make these take good pictures,&quot; she 
muttered as she pulled her phone out. Of the many photos she had taken, 
one of them revealed the information they had been seeking: Fitzgerald&#39;s 
plans for the three practice matches.

&quot;You know,&quot; Jill said, &quot;we could have just asked him.&quot;

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;Adversaries Revealed&quot;

 

&quot;You two do realize that what you&#39;ve done is very duplicitous,&quot; Rosewood 
said, glancing sternly at her son and daughter. &quot;I know I have not 
always been there for you as a mother, but I do know I have raised you 
better. To think that you would sneak into the Chairman&#39;s school and 
infiltrate his office, merely to acquire this information! It&#39;s enough 
to make me feel shameful. However,&quot; she added, shifting her tone to a 
gentler inflection, &quot;I understand why you did it, and why you felt it 
was the right thing to do, so I will not punish you. Just exercise more 
prudence in the future.&quot;

&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; they murmured. Rosewood took a cleansing breath and sat 
at her desk, waving her children&#39;s findings before her.

&quot;Now that that unpleasantness is over with and you&#39;ve heard my official 
stand on the matter, I&#39;d like to unofficially thank you for your 
bravery. I&#39;m still surprised, of course, but a mother can&#39;t help but 
feel proud towards her children at moments like this. Knowing 
Fitzgerald, he&#39;d never tell me who the teams were going up against, so 
at least they&#39;re more prepared. I&#39;ll alert Coaches Bracton and Leena as 
soon as possible; until then, do try and keep yourselves out of 
trouble.&quot;

&quot;Yes, mother,&quot; they smiled. Rosewood dismissed them, and a great weight 
fell off their shoulders as they left her office.

&quot;It was worth it,&quot; Mary said. Jerry nodded.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m glad we took the risk. Now we know what we&#39;re up against.&quot;

&quot;I only wish Jill or I were on the ladies&#39; team so we could tell them.&quot;

&quot;Well, nobody will stop you from visiting.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t even know when they meet!&quot;

&quot;Coach Bracton has us going the weekends. We were meeting every day for 
a few hours, but he changed our schedule for some reason. Maybe the 
women meet on the weekdays now.&quot;

&quot;Possibly. Mother will take care of it, though. You just concentrate on 
winning!&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m too busy hanging out with my new brothers!&quot;

&quot;Oh, do you do anything special together?&quot; she squealed, eyes shimmering 
with hope. Jerry laughed at her.

&quot;And just what might you think we...uh, are doing?&quot;

&quot;Oh, never mind,&quot; she giggled. &quot;Just leave me with my fantasies. So do 
you have any plans now that you&#39;re free?&quot;

&quot;The guys are all going to the park for some extra practice- shirts 
versus skins. We&#39;ll probably hit an arcade or two along the way.&quot;

&quot;Mmm, yummy! It&#39;s too bad I can&#39;t be a spectator: Jill and I are going 
to that nightclub. That will be kind of like shirts versus skins.&quot;

&quot;Sounds wholesome and not at all sexual in any way. Later.&quot;

&quot;Bye!&quot;

 

- Terra Tu, Vietnamese, unknown weight (average), left back-

 

The soccer team traditionally began their meetings by warming up and 
running three laps around the field, sparing most of their chatter until 
later. Changing their schedule to make the meetings more frequent was 
beginning to show its effectiveness. While some of the women still 
looked a little stretched from the recent change, they were also 
improving significantly from so much exercise. Still, it was only the 
first week of the new arrangement, and they had less than two weeks to 
get everything right for their first practice game. Once everyone 
completed their laps, Leena called them together for an announcement.

&quot;Okay, doing great, keep it up. Uh, I have some good news, ladies: we 
finally know who we&#39;ll be up against for our three practice games. This 
knowledge may not bring us an advantage, but at least it&#39;ll help us 
prepare better. Are any of you all familiar with Laudendale University?&quot; 
Several hands raised and a number of girls shook their heads. &quot;Okay, 
some of you. That&#39;s good. We&#39;ll be playing them first, and thanks to 
Miss Hohenheim&#39;s, uh, connections, we know that their skills are about 
level with ours.&quot;

&quot;So is their sports program new, too?&quot; Valencia said.

&quot;Yes, they just started this semester, but they&#39;re a larger school, and 
they&#39;ve been functioning longer than we have, so it&#39;s likely they have a 
broader selection of players. I doubt their offense is as great as ours, 
but that&#39;s our only strength for the moment, so expect them to work 
around that. I also learned that the time has been moved up: we&#39;ll now 
be meeting on the twenty-fifth of August instead of the thirty-first, 
which means we now have about ten days to get our act together.

&quot;I think that would justify some complaining,&quot; Felicity said, and nearly 
everyone else agreed.

&quot;Oh, pipe down,&quot; Fausta grumbled. &quot;This just means we&#39;ll have to work 
harder. Do you know who our other two opponents will be?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and their schedules have been bumped up as well. The second team 
is Anolis University. I trust most of you know of them.&quot;

&quot;Good lord, are you serious?&quot; Jen squealed. &quot;There&#39;s no way we&#39;ll beat 
them.&quot;

&quot;Are th-they any g-good?&quot; Amy wondered.

&quot;They play on the national level,&quot; she reported grimly. &quot;Anolis has a 
long history of making it to the finals and getting out of tight 
situations. They even had a perfect season one year!&quot;

&quot;So Mr. Fitzgerald chose a team we have little chance of beating,&quot; Fleur 
gestured. &quot;Of course, if I wanted to disband this team, I&#39;d do the exact 
same thing.&quot;

&quot;Sometimes I wonder about you,&quot; Fausta muttered bitterly. Fleur grinned 
sharply at her.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry about me. My pride&#39;s on the line, so I&#39;m not about to 
let this team lose.&quot;

&quot;A good position to have,&quot; Leena said. &quot;If you think you&#39;ll fail, then 
you will. We don&#39;t know how we&#39;re going to do until we do it, so I 
suggest you keep your attitudes up. It&#39;s not like we have no hope, and 
even if we lose, there&#39;s still one more match to play: Lovelace 
Academy.&quot; The team murmured anxiously, and a few girls turned pale.

&quot;Sounds girly,&quot; Lauren snorted.

&quot;Ignorance is bliss in this instance,&quot; Arina said to her. &quot;It&#39;s a public 
school for women, so you have one assumption right. But they&#39;re hardly 
ladies on the soccer field, judging from the videos I&#39;ve seen. I hear 
several professional teams go to Lovelace first when they scout.&quot;

&quot;Oh shit, really? Are they that good?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re probably at the same level as Anolis,&quot; Kasumi sighed. &quot;I went 
to a few of their away games, and I was impressed. A lot of their 
players were out of my league.&quot;

&quot;That means we&#39;re screwed, then,&quot; Valencia grumbled, reclining lazily on 
the Astroturf. &quot;Kasumi&#39;s really good, and if they&#39;re better than her...&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t just fucking quit!&quot; Fausta roared, pulling clumps of grass out 
and squeezing them. &quot;I don&#39;t give a shit about our chances! If you say 
we can&#39;t win, I&#39;m going to prove you wrong! I&#39;m going to train harder 
and longer, because I don&#39;t want to embarrass myself!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m with ya on that one,&quot; Shannon said, slapping her back firmly. &quot;I&#39;ve 
nevah backed down from a challenge befoah! Besides, isn&#39;t the whole 
point o&#39; this game to see what happens to us when we&#39;re pushed? Frankly, 
I&#39;d like to see what comes out!&quot;

&quot;And they&#39;re not perfect,&quot; Felicity added, slowly feeling a fire awaken 
in her that she had long thought extinguished. &quot;I&#39;ve seen those games as 
well, and they do have weaknesses. We can&#39;t give up.&quot;

&quot;Right, and lots of other lame buzzwords to encourage us!&quot; Fleur 
shouted. &quot;This is completely repulsive. &#39;Oh yeah, let&#39;s never give up 
and do our best! It doesn&#39;t matter if we win, it&#39;s how we play!&#39; Good 
lord. We&#39;re not in grade school anymore, and this isn&#39;t the Girl Scouts. 
All the cheerleading in the world won&#39;t help us if we don&#39;t shut our 
holes and work for it. Actions yield the only results.&quot;

&quot;So give an example and do two extra laps,&quot; Leena suggested. Fleur 
smiled devilishly and leaped to her feet. Before she began, she imparted 
once last piece of advice for her team.

&quot;If you all are smart, you&#39;ll follow my example. So cut out all this 
foolishness and get busy. I&#39;m not about to humiliate myself either.&quot;

&quot;Damn, but she&#39;s a bitch!&quot; Lauren shivered.

&quot;Although one with a good point,&quot; Jen said, grunting as she stood up. 
&quot;We need to start getting serious. Coach, tell us how we can survive.&quot;

 

- Kasumi Beckett, American, unknown weight (very fit), striker-

 

The ladies of Carnegie&#39;s fledgling soccer team worked hard, so it only 
made sense for them to play hard, too- and it being Tuesday, nearly all 
of them voted to visit Out and About. A handful of them were still 
skittish about visiting a lesbian nightclub that allowed its guests to 
romp around topless, particularly Terra, Felicity, and Shannon. Threal 
ducked out once again, while Terra at least promised she&#39;d try &quot;some 
other week&quot;, maybe after the first practice game, and Felicity buried 
herself in her work, staying at the field until the sun went down and 
the stars came out. Everyone else was in attendance, even Amy, who was 
slowly recovering from her heartbreak.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you came with us!&quot; Valencia beamed as she unbuttoned her 
shirt. &quot;We should do more things as a team. Say, I wonder if the Coach 
will treat us to anything if we actually manage to win.&quot;

&quot;D-do you m-m-mean the practice g-games?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; she exclaimed, loosening the last button. She wasn&#39;t 
wearing a bra, so Amy tried not to leer. &quot;I have...no expectations about 
our long-term victory. We should take like a vote on where we can go 
once this is over. What about you? Anyplace in particular?&quot;

&quot;Um...I c-can&#39;t think of anyth-thing right n-now.&quot; Amy kept her eyes 
locked on the ceiling, fighting to keep her propriety. She had never 
been flirty or wild, and couldn&#39;t imagine herself ever hooking up with 
someone like that.

&quot;Well, give it some time!&quot; Valencia exclaimed, tapping the taller woman 
on the arm. &quot;I&#39;m going to find Kasumi and dance with her. I&#39;m thinking 
maybe she could be a good girlfriend. You should have some fun, too!&quot; 
She smiled and waltzed away, leaving Amy a little flushed. It wasn&#39;t 
just Valencia, though: Out and About was crammed with beautiful, wild, 
half-naked women that evening, and it was too much for Amy to bear. She 
knew she didn&#39;t belong there, so she left, excusing herself meekly, 
trying not to engage anyone&#39;s attention, suffocating from the pressure 
until she was outside again underneath the clear, cleansing sky.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever be doing that again,&quot; she gasped, fanning 
herself frantically.

&quot;You couldn&#39;t stand it either, huh?&quot; Amy jerked with surprise and 
whirled around, trying to calm her frantic pulse. Standing behind her 
was a beautiful brunette, impeccably dressed with a regal bearing. She 
wore a pink skirt and a white blouse, and had her hair tied back with a 
red band. There was a clear, calming look in her eyes that settled Amy&#39;s 
nerves, even as she caught her breath and wiped her face.

&quot;Can&#39;t say that I blame you,&quot; she gestured, walking closer. &quot;I&#39;m not 
usually cut out for loud parties myself. Were you just curious to see if 
the rumors were true, or were you dragged here by friends as well?&quot;

&quot;Um...the s-second,&quot; she murmured. The brunette smiled warmly.

&quot;Same here. All of my friends are wild, and it&#39;s amazing they&#39;ve still 
kept me around. I&#39;d much rather curl up with a good manga. Do you read 
manga?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m n-not sure w-w-what that is.&quot; The other girl smiled and reached out 
her hand.

&quot;Japanese graphic novels. I can let you borrow a few if you&#39;d like. If 
I&#39;m not mistaken...you&#39;re on the new soccer team. Ah! I knew I 
recognized you! Wait- are you Amy?&quot;

&quot;Y-yes,&quot; she said cautiously. How did this woman, who Amy hardly knew 
herself, know her?

&quot;Terra&#39;s told me about you. Uh, sorry, I&#39;m bad at meeting strangers. I&#39;m 
Robin.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; They shook hands, but Amy still wasn&#39;t clear who this angelic 
creature was. Owner of Parody, hostess of Wednesday night video game 
tournaments, Gardenia&#39;s best friend...there had to be something else.

&quot;Since you aren&#39;t the type to enjoy this sort of thing,&quot; Robin said, 
gesturing to the nightclub, &quot;I can only assume some of the others conned 
you into it. I saw a few of them in there. Say, maybe you&#39;d like coming 
to game night tomorrow. It&#39;s still loud and crazy, but not this much. Or 
we could hang out over the weekend if you&#39;ve got the time.&quot;

&quot;You w-w-want t-to hang out with m-m-me?&quot; she questioned, unsure of this 
new turn of events.

&quot;Sure! We could make a date of it.&quot;

&quot;A date?!&quot; she blurted. This was too much. They had only met two minutes 
ago and now she was being asked out on a date! Robin gave her an 
assuring smile and sidled away, not wanting to stifle her.

&quot;Am I being a bit presumptuous? Sorry. We can just hang out as friends 
if you&#39;d like. I just figured it&#39;d be nice if I met someone a little 
calmer than- &quot;

&quot;A d-date sounds n-nice,&quot; Amy stuttered, feeling excited. &quot;Um...I 
m-mean...I&#39;ll d-do it if you w-w-want.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; she grinned. &quot;So let&#39;s meet tomorrow before the tournament and 
I&#39;ll cook you dinner. What would you like?&quot;

&quot;Y-you don&#39;t have to g-g-go through the t-trouble,&quot; she smiled warmly.

&quot;Eh, I was gonna make something anyway. How does Mediterranean nachos 
sound? Can&#39;t go wrong with Mexican-Italian.&quot;

&quot;Anyth-thing is f-fine.&quot; Amy then grew a little bolder and added, 
&quot;W-would you like to d-d-do something right n-now?&quot;

&quot;You mean go back in there and dance?&quot; She blushed and started to 
breathe heavily.

&quot;If y-you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;Maybe for a few minutes. We can take a nice walk later, and you can 
tell me all about the team. Fausta and Terra are pretty tight-lipped 
about it.&quot;

&quot;I s-still don&#39;t kn-know the others v-v-very well,&quot; Amy gestured. She 
took a deep breath and said, &quot;But...I will t-try and answer your 
qu-questions.&quot; Robin beamed at her and they went back inside, feeling a 
little more comfortable with a kindred spirit along.

 

- Amy Nguyen, Vietnamese, 155 lbs (70.4 kg), right back-

 

When Tuesday ended and Wednesday began, the team had only nine days left 
to prepare for their very first practice match- which meant they really 
had to crack down on their training or else risk humiliation and an 
early demise. This also meant that they had to start making sacrifices: 
social obligations, evenings out, eating habits, romantic 
pursuits...things that one can take for granted.

&quot;I know I said I&#39;d go to the faih with ya, Scott, but I really gotta 
focus on this game. I&#39;ve been gettin&#39; sloppy with my footwork and I 
won&#39;t be able to rest until I get it right.&quot;

&quot;No problemo, I&#39;m used to it by now. Just don&#39;t get pissed off if I take 
some sexy young lady with me instead.&quot;

&quot;So what am I, a replacement?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, most of the time,&quot; he laughed. &quot;Tell ya what: I&#39;ll come watch you 
kick some Laudendale ass, and you can make it up to me by giving me a 
backstage pass to the locker rooms.&quot;

&quot;Would if I could,&quot; she chuckled. &quot;Sorry, Chahlie, but I think most of 
em&#39; really are gay.&quot;

&quot;At least introduce me. Don&#39;t work too hard, Cannon.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir. You have fun, now.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; Shannon hung up and tried to shrug her guilt off. What 
kind of a friend was she, giving up a few hours with Scott just to beat 
herself up on the field? But this was her life now, and she knew that if 
she turned her back on it, she would regret it forever. Unfortunately, 
Shannon was not the only person forced to endure this trial.

&quot;What a disaster!&quot; Robin groaned as she closed the store down. &quot;This has 
been our lowest turnout ever!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s probably going to get worse when the season starts,&quot; Odessa 
reasoned. Wednesday night games had suffered from the lack of 
participation: Parody was almost completely empty that evening due to 
the increased training crunch- and when Saturday evening rolled around, 
most of the girls were too exhausted to watch the double feature.

&quot;And I picked such great movies, too!&quot; Gardenia moaned. She was showing 
Ghostbusters and Bound; next week would be the original Ninja Turtles 
movie and Wild Things, but she expected turnout to be even lower due to 
the game. Of course, with everyone busy with training, Out and About 
just wasn&#39;t the same, either. Leena was trying very hard to restrict 
unnecessary activity- not because she objected to having a good time, 
but because she knew that any distraction, however well-deserved it 
might be, would be damaging and even fatal to the games. It was much 
more difficult to hammer this into the novices&#39; heads; the veterans 
understood the full scope of their sacrifice and accepted their heavy 
burdens.

&quot;I&#39;m flattered, but I&#39;ll have to pass for now,&quot; Kasumi said to Valencia.

&quot;So...you&#39;re not ready?&quot;

&quot;I feel like I am,&quot; she answered as she delivered another practice kick 
to the goalie, &quot;but now&#39;s not a good time. I can&#39;t go out on dates 
during training. That&#39;s what it means to be on this team: you give up 
stuff so you can accomplish bigger goals.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she grunted, diving and catching another ball. &quot;I&#39;m still new 
to this. I&#39;ve never had to give up anything like that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s tough,&quot; Kasumi muttered grimly. &quot;I gave up a lot coming here, but 
I also think I gained a lot in return.&quot;

&quot;I know I gained some sore muscles!&quot; she cried, diving and missing a 
ball. Kasumi took a deep breath and helped Valencia up. She smiled at 
her sadly and, feeling a little bold, bent down to kiss her cheek.

&quot;Ask me again once we win. I&#39;d be happy to go out with you then.&quot;

&quot;You sure do know how to motivate a girl,&quot; Val murmured dreamily.

&quot;Okay, ladies, that&#39;s enough of a break!&quot; Freya shouted. &quot;Get your heads 
out of the clouds and get your butts back to work! We&#39;re not going to 
lose on your account!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not the coach, Freya,&quot; Valencia reminded her. Leena glanced up 
from her book and raised her sunglasses. She had been tanning.

&quot;Do what she says, you two. Nguyen, Lacroix, excellent hustle! Keep up 
the footwork! You&#39;re lagging behind, Hawthorne- I know you&#39;ve got more 
than that in you! Don&#39;t hog the ball, Nazario! Miss Hohenheim&quot; she 
gestured, &quot;they&#39;re all yours again.&quot;

&quot;Danke shoein, Frau Leena! Okay, Nadia, don&#39;t be a chicken! Just score a 
goal!&quot;

&quot;Her head iz getting too big for neck,&quot; she muttered. Felicity snorted.

&quot;I&#39;ll say.&quot; Out of all the players, Velur had been affected the least by 
this crunch, but only because she had been fanatically applying herself 
since day one. All of her dedication was now coming to fruition as she 
dominated the field and showed what a force to be reckoned with she was. 
But even Leena knew that too much work was bad for one&#39;s body, and tried 
to encourage Felicity to take a breather and relax once in awhile. That 
she continued to refuse these golden offers was reason for concern, and 
Leena seriously believed that something else was behind this relentless 
drive- something that horrified her prize forward and kept her secluded 
from everyone and everything.

&quot;So how are you and Khovansky handling this?&quot; Lauren asked Elisa during 
a break. The two of them were slowly becoming friends, despite their 
vast differences in personality.

&quot;We&#39;re just handling it, is all,&quot; she answered humbly. &quot;After discussing 
things a little, we decided there&#39;s no need to rush. It&#39;s not like we 
never see each other, either, and isn&#39;t time spent together, regardless 
of where or when, the whole point of relationships?&quot;

&quot;Saaaage,&quot; Lauren crooned. &quot;You are so fuckin&#39; wise. You&#39;re like 
freakin&#39; Yoda.&quot;

&quot;No, not at all,&quot; she laughed sadly. &quot;You&#39;re not having any problems, 
are you?&quot;

&quot;Nope, not a one. I&#39;m used to all this training shit. You know, with 
baseball.&quot;

&quot;Ah. Everyone here is so athletic but me!&quot;

&quot;And Al and Arina,&quot; she listed. &quot;But even they could run circles around 
Fuhrer Lesbo. Don&#39;t get so discouraged, okay? We got&#39;cher back.&quot; Elisa 
smiled feebly and returned to work, patiently waiting for the day when 
her time could be just for her and Nadia, and nothing else. Terra and 
Fausta waited a little longer to return to their drills; they had both 
been working very hard and had earned the rest.

&quot;So...how do you feel about our chances?&quot;

&quot;Well, if this keeps up, we&#39;ll definitely have a better shot at winning. 
I&#39;m surprised that so many of them are getting into it. I am loathe to 
admit it, but even Lauren&#39;s showing some aptitude.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s because of what Fleur said earlier. Nobody wants to 
embarrass herself.&quot;

&quot;I certainly didn&#39;t come this far just to lose,&quot; Fausta muttered. She 
smiled faintly at Terra and added, &quot;You&#39;ve certainly improved. Where do 
you get all your energy?&quot;

&quot;Sugar and anime, mostly,&quot; she chuckled. Fausta cringed, so Terra 
quickly edited her response. &quot;Uh, but seriously, I&#39;ve been taking 
martial arts for years. It was one of the few things my parents approved 
of.&quot;

&quot;Teach me some of it later,&quot; she asked, taking one more drink before 
jumping back into the game. Terra sighed in a lament to her lost free 
time. So much for hanging out with Mayu and the boys. Tuesdays and 
Wednesdays would be shot for awhile now.

 

- Freya von Hohenheim, German, 90 lbs (41 kg), manager-

 

Nine days came and went too quickly for the ladies of Carnegie&#39;s soccer 
team. Even though many of them still felt like they weren&#39;t ready, time 
wouldn&#39;t wait for them: the day of their first trial had finally 
arrived. Their brothers were scheduled to play their first practice game 
tomorrow, which meant they would have to set a good precedent. It would 
be a home game, so the girls had a slight advantage in terms of 
familiarity, but that didn&#39;t put their nerves at ease. Some prayed, 
others pumped themselves up, and a few even held hands. Once they were 
all dressed in their uniforms, Leena called them together for one final 
piece of advice.

&quot;Relax!&quot; she exclaimed as she looked over them. &quot;You won&#39;t perform very 
well looking so stiff! Just loosen up and have fun. This is only the 
first practice game of three, so don&#39;t feel too bad if you mess up. I 
certainly won&#39;t think the worst of you for it if you do. Still, there&#39;s 
no harm in putting yourself in the right mindset. If you&#39;ll permit me, 
I&#39;ve devised a little mantra for us to chant before we start our games. 
I want our passion for this sport to be as strong and absolute as this 
poetry.&quot;

Oh, god, Fleur grumbled, rolling her eyes. But Leena knew what she was 
doing; she made her selection carefully. The mantra was written on a 
plaque Kathlyn and Shiki had made over the past few days, and they hung 
it proudly beneath the nameplates.

Batter my heart, that I may rise, and stand;

O&#39;erthrow me, and bend Your force,

To break, blow, burn and make me new...

Take me to You, imprison me, for I

Except You enthrall me, never shall be free,

Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me.

&quot;By John Donne. Repeat it if you would.&quot; As the girls read the selection 
aloud, some more reverently than others, someone snuck into the locker 
room and waited for her chance to slip through. As soon as Alice broke 
away from the group, the intruder made her move and tackled the taller 
woman.

&quot;Hey there!&quot; Alice jumped in surprise, but her anxiety loosened as she 
saw Rain&#39;s beautiful face smiling at her. She embraced her warmly and 
even kissed her.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Duh! I&#39;m here to wish you all good luck! I&#39;ll be in the front row 
cheering you on! Did you hear that, Fleur?&quot;

&quot;I heard you,&quot; she replied flatly. &quot;I was wondering what sort of 
foolishness you&#39;d attempt. Please don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve done anything to 
the other team.&quot;

&quot;Uh, no,&quot; she murmured, &quot;but now that you mention it, maybe I 
should...um, never mind. Just kick some butt out there, both of you. I 
mean, uh, it&#39;s not like I care about the team or anything, but...you 
know...you all are my friends.&quot; Alice smiled warmly and kissed her 
again; Fleur rolled her eyes.

&quot;If you&#39;re through with the sentiment, we have a game to play, Howlet.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Yes ma&#39;am, so sorry to bother you! Hit em&#39; hard, Hawthorne! Show 
them who&#39;s boss, Lacroix!&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Alice gushed, kissing Rain one more time before reuniting with 
her team. Leena advised them to take a deep breath, relax, and just do 
the best they could.

&quot;Here goes,&quot; Freya whispered as she pushed the door open, leading her 
team onto the field.
