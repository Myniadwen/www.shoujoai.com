<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 42 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/chasers-ch41.html">Back to Part 41</a><pre>The first explosion was exactly at midnight on New
Years Eve. The financial district was still running
electronically, of course, they hadn&#39;t closed it down
for holidays in many years, but thankfully no one was
inside the building as the first floor erupted in
flames, the windows blowing right out from the force
of the blasts.

Police and emergency response vehicles were already on
their way there precisely a minute later when the next
blast hit, a power transformer across the city going
up in a fireball. Lights went out in that district,
elevators stopped and the air circulation went,
inspiring some concern in the massive towers in the
city.

Trying to decide on the priority for response the
police were confused, even more so when in another
minute a primary road detonated. The supports and
superstructure were mined, it was decided later, the
bombs placed in eerie precision just so, to cut away
the ramp and then sever the section of road, sending
it plummeting down into the valley between high rises,
doing even more damage on the way to the ground.

Then the vehicle lift system went out, a
transportation essential in the city. The central
computer center exploded exactly three minutes after
the first bomb blast, the rest of the building
miraculously untouched. But without the lifts there
were panic, people unable to rise and fall between the
towers in their vehicles, stuck dealing with longer
routes on ramps now battered or damaged.

The fifth and final explosion went off four minutes
after midnight, and the explosion at City Hall made
the rest of them look minor in comparison. The records
office was a complete write off, paper and electronic
data storage all ruined by the powerful blast, flames
rippling through the building. It took hours for
emergency services to get the flames under control,
and even longer to assess the scope of damage, but it
was clearly a crippling blow.

Exactly as intended.

Alpha nodded to herself slightly as they listened in
on emergency frequencies, assessing the movements of
the various forces around the city as they monitored
the effects of their actions. The tall redhead looked
thoughtful, her clothes well chosen to project her
authority, and even though she was beautiful there was
nothing warm or welcoming in her face.

Gamma and Delta worked to plot all the activities of
the vehicles and units, displaying them on a board
mounted on the wall of the Lowtown suite, a step up
from their last residence. Icons represented police,
fire department, emergency managers, ambulances and
finally four golden icons representing the primary
officers of the Chasers.

Beta smiled slightly, the average looking black haired
woman standing nearby Alpha. &quot;I&#39;m a bit surprised at
how badly prepared they are,&quot; the human interaction
specialist noted, her business suit crisp and neat.

&quot;Wait for it,&quot; Delta said softly, a faint smile on the
brown haired woman&#39;s face.

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Alpha murmured as a secondary command
center suddenly came on line. Commands went out to
confused and disorganized officers and emergency
services, and soon they began to get to the crisis
points much more effectively.

&quot;How?&quot; Gamma blinked, the blonde looking honestly
confused.

&quot;Beth Harris and Gwen Musashi,&quot; Delta said promptly,
&quot;they covertly set up the Chasers command center as a
secondary emergency coordination unit. I suspect they
took command once they verified City Hall was
offline.&quot;

&quot;Is that legal?&quot; Beta blinked.

&quot;Probably not entirely,&quot; Alpha murmured, &quot;but I
suspect no one will argue with the results.&quot; A smile,
&quot;City Hall may even claim it was officially approved
after this is over.&quot;

&quot;Delta, like we discussed,&quot; Beta prompted her.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Delta hurried over to her computer set
up, sitting down at the bank of towers and smoothly
plugging in a cable to her arm. Monitors flickered to
life as data began to scroll by, faster than any human
could read then she murmured, &quot;Beginning cyberdive,
now.&quot;

Gamma watched with some concern as Delta stiffened,
the majority of her consciousness becoming focused on
her dive into the city internet, and beyond that the
world wide web. Normally attempting to raid the city,
with defenses created by the formidable Beth Harris,
would be very unwise, but they were gambling that the
chaos would give them an edge.

&quot;I&#39;m in,&quot; Delta murmured. A second in which gigabytes
of data moved by her command, &quot;The defenses were only
partially upgraded before we hit, we&#39;re in luck.&quot;

&quot;We need identification papers for our new cover
identities,&quot; Alpha frowned before admitting, &quot;the ones
we can acquire on the black market are substandard for
our needs. Our covers must be impenetrable, at least
until we&#39;re ready to act.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll have them,&quot; Delta vowed.

Beta watched the screen as emergency forces moved to
bring the attack under control, but it looked like
they would be at work a long time. &quot;At least we know
our internal cloaks work,&quot; she murmured, &quot;none of the
security systems spotted us as androids.&quot;

&quot;I was terrified I was going to be discovered,&quot; Gamma
admitted, the little blonde smoothly checking over
some of their weapons cache while they waited. She
disassembled a rifle efficiently, examining the pieces
critically then put it back together.

&quot;Is it me or is she trying to be TOO human?&quot; Beta
blinked, but Alpha didn&#39;t comment, she was focused on
Delta.

Delta shuddered visibly, then her thin body finally
seemed to relax. &quot;It&#39;s done,&quot; she said as she pulled
the connection cable from her arm with a sigh, &quot;our
covers are made and I reported that we lost our
identifications for various reasons. They&#39;ll be mailed
out to safe drops around the city in the next few
days.&quot;

&quot;Well done,&quot; Alpha smiled. After a moment she asked,
&quot;And the data I asked for?&quot;

&quot;I did a partial download of Chasers criminal files,&quot;
Delta sounded a bit frustrated as she reported, &quot;but
their core system remained sealed off. The data I got
is also encrypted, but I believe I can crack that in a
few days.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Alpha reassured her, &quot;those files will
make a excellent bargaining chip for when I approach
the android rights movement.&quot;

&quot;Should we do that?&quot; Beta asked respectfully. &quot;Forgive
me,&quot; she smiled faintly, &quot;but they seem too...
amateurish.&quot;

&quot;By our standards they are,&quot; Alpha agreed, &quot;but they
have contacts and information we don&#39;t.&quot; She sighed,
&quot;They may know some way to help our sisters Theta and
Epsilon, as well as being useful in our future plans.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to set a standard guard tonight?&quot; Gamma
asked respectfully, picking up a small pistol and
sliding it away into a holster beneath her arm.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Alpha nodded, &quot;and let&#39;s continue to monitor
events, as well. I&#39;m curious to see how long it takes
the city to recover from tonight.&quot;

In another part of Lowtown several figures also
monitored the night&#39;s goings on, but with a great deal
more alarm. Over in a corner the tawny haired sexaroid
shook her head, her expression grim as Nyara said,
&quot;This could be very bad.&quot;

Christa reached out to squeeze her lover&#39;s shoulder
gently, standing close for comfort. &quot;Do you think it
was androids that did this, then?&quot; the white haired
young woman asked, listening to the latest news
reports come in.

&quot;Even if it wasn&#39;t done by androids we&#39;ll possibly be
blamed for it,&quot; Nyara noted. She frowned, &quot;I don&#39;t
understand this, what statement were they trying to
make?&quot;

&quot;Maybe they aren&#39;t making a statement,&quot; Christa
answered grimly, &quot;showing they could do this might be
message enough.&quot;

Nyara looked off into the distance, lost in troubling
thoughts. &quot;We&#39;ll have to talk about their motivation
later,&quot; she finally said, &quot;we have work to do.&quot;

&quot;You want to issue a statement?&quot; Christa anticipated
her lover as usual.

&quot;From the organization, yes,&quot; Nyara said, &quot;denying any
involvement in this and offering our condolences to
the families of anyone slain.&quot; She paused, &quot;And we&#39;ll
need to put the word out to a few of our &#39;passing&#39;
members to be cautious.&quot;

&quot;You think the police will go after androids living as
human beings?&quot; Christa asked as she began to dial the
older phone.

&quot;I hope not,&quot; Nyara said, &quot;but this might just
convince the police to try again.&quot;

Christa talked to someone a moment, then dialed up
another number. &quot;Should we try to pump Beth for
information?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Bringing it up in casual conversation wouldn&#39;t be
easy,&quot; Nyara shook her head, &quot;and drugging her is too
chancy. No, we&#39;ll save sweet Beth for emergencies.&quot;</pre>
