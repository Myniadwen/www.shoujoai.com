Palace of Dreams, Forbidden Tokyo

Deep in the uncharacteristically Georgian halls of Forbidden Tokyo&#39;s 
Palace of Dreams, far into its many winding passages and rooms, sat 
Shinryu. Upon that mighty polish steel throne, before the Great Hall 
from which she would decide the fates of all. The powerful leader of the 
Jikininki smiled to herself, her thin pink lips curling upwards. 
Princess Umi had assembled a team of warriors to fight her? Well them... 
maybe it was time that Shinryu showed Umi that the gifts given to them 
by their Ashidah blood was not something to toy with. Maybe it was time 
to show the Princess just what she was dealing with. 

And so she got to work. Shinryu tossed her long ponytail of jet black 
hair to one side of her head; over her shoulder. Then thrust her right 
arm forwards. The loose sleeved of her dress fell downwards a little, 
over her wrist. Just as her slender fingers jutted forwards. And soon a 
bright sprinkling of light began to pour from that hand. Little drops of 
sparkling energy, falling from Shinryu&#39;s hand to the white-grey marble 
of the floor. Those sprinkles of magical energy did not fade as they 
made contact with the ground. They did the opposite. The more that 
Shinryu poured into her efforts, the more the sprinkles reacted. As far 
as to take shape. Those small dots of beautiful magical power began to 
create some of itself. They became something... collective. A form of 
mass. Which became more and more shapely till it gave off a shape of a 
figure. With a loud &#39;whoosh&#39; sound, the energies surrounding that figure 
faded to nothing. Leaving behind that which had been created. Shinryu 
smiled at it. It was a statue. In the image of a young man, surrounded a 
futuristically built armour that had been made into the image of 
classical 14th Century European armour. The statue six feet tall at the 
least. But made of stone. Or so it seemed. 

Shinryu leaned onto the armrest of her throne, supporting her elbow on 
it. And forcing her fist against her cheek. Never had she expected to 
have a use for one of her Five Sacred Spirit Soldiers in this day and 
age... but... Princess Umi had assembled a fine force for herself. The 
only way that Shinryu could match that would be to send out a powerful 
force of her own. Only this time, her Spirit Soldier would not would not 
falter, like the worthless Oniko that Shinryu had sent before. Now it 
was time to awaken her subject. Shinryu simply brought up her right hand 
and grinned. She snapped her fingertips, and upon that moment, that 
statue began to react. The stone that it had seemed to be made off 
became nothing. Soon the plates of armour, the helmet, the skin, the 
limbs; all of it reverted from stone to their true forms. Steel and 
flesh. Until the soldier was completely free from his stone confinement. 
The young man, peering out to look from the eye-slits his protective 
helmet, cast his gaze to the throne of the Palace of Dreams. And to the 
woman who was sitting on it. 

He instantly fell to his knees in reverence of her. &quot;...Lord Shinryu... 
You have awoken me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Tenma,&quot; Shinryu replied, &quot;New dangers are threatening Tokyo. I 
need your powers once again if I am to avert disaster. Princess Umi is 
about to turn of age. At all costs, she needs to be secured. She is a 
key point in my plans. Without her; nothing can be achieved.&quot;

Tenma understood this much. &quot;Do you wish me to capture her?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Shinryu had already thought about that side of things, &quot;The Oniko 
are enough for that request. The main problem is that she has five 
bodyguards. Each summoned from a different world or a different 
variation of our own world. These people must be destroyed. Once I have 
them out of the way... I can move on with the process of capturing 
Princess Umi on my own. But for now...&quot;

Tenma nodded to the leader of the Jikininki. &quot;Understood. I will not 
fail you, Lord Shinryu. Where can I find these bodyguards of the Young 
Princess?&quot;

&quot;Do not be worried. They will be coming to you&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Keiya &amp; Esperanza&#39;s Apartment, Forbidden Tokyo

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to do this for me, Esppie. I could have taken care of 
myself while the others are away.&quot;

Esperanza D&#39;Laine rung out the wet towel in her hands over a thin basin 
of water. The second that it was damp (not wet) she draped it over the 
forehead of the lilac-haired Keiya. To be perfectly honest; she had been 
very worried about Keiya. Ever since they had been called from their own 
realities to this one; Keiya Shindou had been having the hardest time in 
adjusting to it. After all she came from a relatively peaceful reality. 
It made her shy and quite reserved. Which was probably one of the 
reasons that Esperanza had taken such a shine to her. Out of all five 
members of the Silver Valkyries, they were the closest, though at heart 
they were complete opposites. Keiya was polite, calm and a bit of a 
worrier. Esperanza was the opposite to that. The American woman was 
unrefined, flirty and lively. She lived every day like it was her very 
last. And though such differences of character were large; they added to 
their friendship. Keiya helped keep Esperanza on earth and under 
control. Whilst Esperanza herself helped Keiya to open up and enjoy life 
more. Polar opposites attract, they say. This rubbed off well on Keiya 
and Esperanza. Of course, Keiya&#39;s attraction went deeper than simple 
friendship. Not that she would ever say so. 

Esperanza pressed the compress down on Keiya&#39;s forehead as she lay on 
the couch. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about all this, cute-stuff. But I couldn&#39;t leave 
you here all alone while we took care of the attack. You know that 
Rinako, Miki and Natsuna can handle it. I just have to make sure that 
you stayed in bed.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not like you... Esperanza,&quot; Keiya shifted in her bed a little, with 
a grin, &quot;When I say that I&#39;ll do something, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

Esperanza scoffed. &quot;Oh ha, ha! Miss Shindou finally cracks a smile and 
she&#39;s doing it while she&#39;s making fun of me? This is rich. But at least 
you&#39;re starting to feel better.&quot;

&quot;All thanks to you.&quot;

&quot;Well... yeah,&quot; The American woman replied, &quot;But I&#39;m still glad. You 
just haven&#39;t been yourself recently. And I&#39;m not talking about the 
cold.&quot;

Well that verged on something that neither woman really had the answer 
to. But that didn&#39;t mean that Esperanza wasn&#39;t searching for one. Of 
course, this was never answered. The second that Keiya parted her lips 
to speak something (anything) the door at the other side of their 
apartment burst right open. It was quite messy (after all, Esperanza was 
a naturally messy person) but that didn&#39;t stop Natsuna and Miki from 
walking inside. Natsuna walked over to the left of this room and flopped 
onto the couch; taking a sigh of relief; while Miki dodged through all 
the panties and food packets sprinkled across the floor to get to Keiya; 
whom had been resting on the other couch. 

Miki bent down at the knees to look at her. &quot;How are you feeling now, 
Keiya?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; She replied, &quot;Esperanza&#39;s been taking good care of me.&quot;

The older Miki looked over at the American. &quot;Is that so...?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t sound so surprised, Miki!&quot; Esperanza claimed sharply, running a 
hand through her shoulder-length emerald hair, &quot;It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t 
have experience with this sort of thing. I used to catch colds all the 
time back home. And I took care of myself pretty well back then too. So 
I think I can handle it.&quot;

Miki smiled at her. She could sort of see the direction that Keiya and 
Esperanza&#39;s relationship was heading. The exact same thing had happened 
with Akira and Mitsuki back home in her home world of Juukumei. &quot;I was 
sure that you could, Esperanza.&quot;

This time Keiya spoke. &quot;So how did it go? Did you take care of the demon 
I sensed?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Natsuna answered the question for her, &quot;We took care of 
it. No thanks to our little &#145;charge&#39;, Princess Umi. You&#39;d think that the 
future ruler of Forbidden Tokyo would have a little more sense than to 
leave the apartment without her cloaking powers, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot;

Esperanza shrugged that off. &quot;Natsuna, just cut her some slack. She&#39;s a 
princess but she&#39;s still human. Everybody wants to go out and live a 
little. Besides, Umi&#39;s fine isn&#39;t she? As long as we protect her then we 
have nothing to worry about.&quot;

Miki held a hand to her chin. &quot;What I&#39;m more concerned with is why the 
Jikininki would send such a weak creature to capture the princess. They 
are obviously planning something special soon. We should be on our toes 
from now onwards.&quot;

But while they discussed this; the leader of the Silver Valkyries was 
far from caring about it at that point. Rinako didn&#39;t go with the others 
to Keiya &amp; Esperanza&#39;s apartment. She walked down the flight of her 
apartment building and into her own apartment. She shared it with 
Princess Umi. It was a weird way to work around things. Even though 
Rinako and the Silver Valkyries were doing their best and protecting 
this city with their lives;  they had to live in some ordinary apartment 
block. Not only that but they had to share their rooms. Rinako lived 
with Princess Umi. Keiya lived with Esperanza. And Miki lived with 
Natsuna. Each pair had their own apartment. It was awkward but they put 
up with it for the time being. 

Rinako slinked inside her apartment, opening the door then slamming it 
behind her. Today had been sort of annoying. Not only did she have to 
stomach shopping with the Princess; she also had to be punched by some 
ogre for the Jikininki. She was actually bruised where she had been hit. 
On the cheek. It was turning purple a little. Which just didn&#39;t suit 
Rinako&#39;s complexion. Or the fact that she hated being hit by someone she 
didn&#39;t feel weaker than. If she had only kept her concentration up 
whilst fighting against the creature. Rinako tried to plot out where 
things went wrong in her head. It made her come back to the fight with 
the Oniko at Shinjuku. Then an image of Princess Umi came to mind. Umi. 
The Ikatsuji-girl shook her head as she realized that Umi was where she 
had gone wrong. The very second that Rinako took her eyes off the Oniko 
and focused on Princess Umi... that was the point at which the monster 
struck. She let her guard down just to look at that bratty girl. But 
Rinako didn&#39;t want to waste anymore time thing about all that. She, Miki 
and Natsuna had defended Umi from attack. That was the main thing. Now 
they had to focus on keeping her safe. As soon as Umi turned eighteen 
then Rinako could get back home. 

The young martial artist yawned aloud as she stalked through her and 
Umi&#39;s apartment. She first whipped off the top of her school uniform; 
leaving behind nothing but her pink bra; then shot into her bedroom and 
flopped onto her comfortable bed. It was one of the few things in the 
alternate version of Tokyo that felt normal. It reminded Rinako a lot of 
Mishizu&#39;s bed back home. That was one of the reasons Rinako made such a 
big deal about it. Not to mention the fact that it was the one place in 
the entire city of Forbidden Tokyo that felt safe. 

Rinako eased her head back on the pillow and took a deep breath. She 
winced a little as she felt a throb at her cheek. Just where the bruise 
was. Typical. It didn&#39;t start hurting until she settled down a little. 
Rinako tried to ignore the slight pain and focused on something else. 
The doorway. It just so happened that someone was standing in the 
doorway. And who was it? None other than Princess Umi herself; arguably 
the reason that Rinako had been smacked in the mouth. The martial artist 
turned over on her bed so that she and Umi didn&#39;t meet eye to eye.

&quot;What the hell do you want?&quot; Rinako wasn&#39;t usually so snappy with Umi; 
but right now she just didn&#39;t want to deal with her and her pompous, 
controlling attitude, &quot;I&#39;m not feeling so good right now. So if I were 
you; I&#39;d just leave, Umi.&quot;

Princess Umi cast her eyes downwards, peering at her painted pink toes 
as they wiggled freely with no restraint by her high heel sandals. 
&quot;...Please do not be angry with me, Rinako. I really did not mean for 
you to be hurt. I just wanted to spend... some time with you.&quot;

Rinako gave a harsh chuckle. &quot;While doing things that you like, right? 
Did you ever stop to think that maybe you could have asked me if I 
wanted to go somewhere else? You knew I wasn&#39;t happy there and you 
didn&#39;t care at all. As long as you got your way, it was fine and dandy. 
And if you had been paying more attention you&#39;d have slipped up your 
cloaking magic before you left the apartment.&quot;

Though Rinako couldn&#39;t see them, small tears were welling up in Umi&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; 

&quot;Why the hell does everyone say that every single time they get caught 
out doing something wrong? It&#39;s not like sorry will smear this damn 
bruise off my face. And it&#39;s not like sorry will get me home. To the 
place I rightfully belong.&quot;

And that was what this was really about. The fact that Umi had summoned 
Rinako from her home world without question. Nevertheless, Umi had no 
choice in the matter. If she were to die or be captured before her 
powers matured... &quot;...R-Rinako... if my world were to go... yours would 
be no safer. The Jikininki... they...&quot;

Rinako sighed into her pillow. She was actually getting tired of being 
angry. Mostly because it was so hard to stay angry with Princess Umi. 
She had a personality that could choke the life of the Pope; but had the 
face and heart of angel. Umi was so delicate and un-seeming at the core 
of it all. &quot;...Look. I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t be snapping at you. I&#39;m just 
not in a good mood right now, Umi. I&#39;m tired and I wanna go home. And 
I&#39;m packing a wad of pain from this damn bruise on my face.&quot;

Well that was one thing that Umi might be able to help with. The 
slightly older girl walked across the untidy floor of Rinako&#39;s room and 
took a seat on the edge of her bed. Rinako rolled back around when she 
felt a shift in the weight on the bed and looked up. Umi had sat down. 
But for what reason? 

&quot;...Umi, wha-&quot;

The young princess thrust her left hand forward. Just over Rinako&#39;s 
face. She let it hang there for a while; ignoring Rinako&#39;s quizzical 
stares and proceeded with her plan. A bright golden power soon began to 
form around the Princess&#39;s fingertips. It shone brightly; leaving a 
vivid glow upon Rinako&#39;s curious face. A small &#145;chime&#39; sound began 
passing through the space of the room. Which the Ikatsuji-girl knew to 
be a sign of Umi&#39;s hidden magic. And Rinako did not begin noticing the 
effects until she felt the pain of the bruise subside. Umi cast Rinako a 
bright smile then lowered her hand. 

Rinako touched her face, confused. &quot;W-What the heck did you do?&quot;

&quot;I eased the pain of the bruise,&quot; Umi replied, &quot;I will not acquire the 
full use of my powers until I turn eighteen. Then I will be able to use 
all of my magic. But for now, I can use small portions of it. It&#39;s the 
same thing I used to bring you here.&quot;

Rinako&#39;s fingers still probed her face. Now it was adorned with a little 
blush. &quot;...Well... uh... thanks, I guess.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t worry about it... just...&quot; Umi&#39;s smile lowered a bit, 
&quot;...Tell me you aren&#39;t angry with me... please...&quot;

After doing something like that, Rinako really didn&#39;t have the stomach 
for being annoyed with Umi. The glare of the martial artist subsided a 
little bit. It was eventually replaced with a smile. Rinako liked it 
when Umi was this way. That pretentious, bratty side to her personality 
was so damaging to the young woman&#39;s overall image. It tended to 
overshadowed her subtle sensitivity and sense of duty. Hopefully, those 
qualities would consume her character flaws. 

Rinako lowered her hand from her face. &quot;No... I&#39;m not angry with you, 
Umi.&quot;
