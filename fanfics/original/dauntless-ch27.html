<p>“Space  Race: where decisions are made”</p>
<p>“…Construction  crews will continue working through traffic hours, so please stay  tuned for further details. And now an update on the Space Race. Every vehicle registered in the race has now passed the first  checkpoint, and very few are experiencing any difficulties so far. In the lead is the <em>Elegant  Clio</em>,  representing Demise Industries, and following close are the <em>Einlanzer  3, Bulldozer, Zephyr,</em> and <em>Opportune  Rain</em>. A minor dispute involving light aggression has stalled several  ships, including the <em>Domination</em>,  which was struck by a sonic disruptor, and the <em>Backdraft</em>,  which  sacrificed precious time to help out. The race is still  anybody’s game, even as participants struggle to reach the  checkpoint caught between the orbits of Hagan 6 and its moon, Oika. We  will have another update as soon it develops, so until then, stay  tuned. Now here’s a look at this week’s forecast.”</p>
<p>Captain  Kaori Chuunaru coldly turned the news feed off and concentrated on  finishing her meal. She was alone in the break room—it was  difficult for her to socialize with her subordinates—and aside from  the droning hum of the <em>Stormrider</em> as it flew through space, it was deadly quiet. Even picking apart a  fish with her chopsticks and nibbling it created a series of noises.  Kaori preferred the silence and the isolation, though: it helped  clear her mind, and it gave her space to move around. A world of  emptiness could be filled with anything she desired; a cluttered area  only invited destruction. She was resisting the urge to eat her  dessert first and had shoved it aside, which took a considerable  amount of discipline. She wanted to focus on her strategy and  couldn’t afford any distractions, minute though they were.</p>
<p>The  cake found a good home five minutes later. Most of her thoughts  centered on what would happen after the race. She wanted to win, of  course—not just for her honor, but for the military’s as well—but  she also wanted to go after the Dead Roses. She had a feeling it  would be impossible to do them both, so if she had to choose, she  would take the second option. What victory was there in winning a  contest when there were threats to safety, sanity, and civilization  running around? Kaori toyed with the idea of hiring that bounty  hunter, Shandra Hill; she also wondered if she could find a few other  freelancers in the area. The Norgrim might help out if there were  benefits involved; the Ozmund people would certainly assist them,  seeing as how they were also troubled by pirates; maybe that Elshyrin  would come along as well, if Kaori offered a position in the UCM. Her  excitement grew as she considered all this (eating all that sugar  made it easier), but then her reasoning shot her down, dragged her to  the side, and pointed out that for the moment, she would just have to  wait.</p>
<p>A  quick, polite knock came at her door, and a female officer poked her  head in. “We’ve intercepted a message, Captain. The <em>Backdraft</em> is hailing us and requests an audience.”</p>
<p>“What’s  this about?”</p>
<p>“He  says he wants to propose an alliance, ma’am. Those are his exact  words. He’s using a voice scrambler, though, so we’re very  suspicious.”</p>
<p>“And  rightly so. All right, I guess I better hear him out. What did they  say his name was? Mr. D? He’s going a little too far with this  secrecy thing, if you ask me.”</p>
<p>“It’s  effective,” said the officer as she led her Captain back to the  bridge. “In spite of all the attention he seems to be avoiding, we  can’t find very much. Our people are looking into any possible  leads and connections. The <em>Backdraft</em> was registered out of Epitaph, and it seems that Nemo Nephele is a  resident private business owner who sponsored the ship for financial  gain. We learned he has an employee named Kaz Derada, but that’s  the extend of our discovery.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Leave  no stone unturned.” Kaori fluidly climbed into her Captain’s  chair and activated the receiver. A picture reading “Sound Only”  appeared on the monitor, and sure enough, a scrambled voice came  through. “This is Captain Chuunaru. What message do you have for  me, Mr. D?”</p>
<p>“An  alliance of like-minded parties,” replied the sluggish, sonorous  voice. “Let us not waste each other’s time. I saw your battle  against the Dead Roses on the news, and I couldn’t help but admire  your tenacity, Captain. My employer, Mr. Nephele, has carried a  grudge against these loathsome sores ever since they ruined an early  enterprise of his, and part of the reason I’ve been sent here is to  make some attempt at revenge. I despise these barbarians, for I have  paid dearly to recover what they stole from my life, and if you would  be so kind, we may form a partnership and erase this scum from our  memories.”</p>
<p>“It  does appear we have the same goals,” Kaori answered cautiously,  “but you forget who you’re addressing, and you forget the  circumstances we’re in.” The voice on the other end laughed  quietly, dark and deep like a troll.</p>
<p>“I  know  you’re the kind who has to do everything by the book, Captain. Your  reputation precedes you faster than light itself. You were  about to say that you’ve never broken the rules, and you’ll be  damned if you stop now—right? What if I were to offer a way  to…<em>bend</em> the rules—or better yet, to avoid them entirely?”</p>
<p>“I’d  say that I was within my rights to arrest you.”</p>
<p>“Even  if the end justifies the means? Even if Captain Rose herself is  brought before a firing squad as a result? Come now, Captain, you’re  a smart woman, even if you are a military dog. You know full well  there are people everywhere who take advantage of those who follow  the rules.”</p>
<p>“You’re  trying to tempt me, and it’s not working,” Kaori muttered  bitterly. She couldn’t deny her curiosity, though, and the rising  willingness to do what she believed in her heart to be right. The  seed was small, but it had been planted. “Listen, I’d be more  than happy to work together once the race is over.”</p>
<p>“Do  you need a demonstration?” said the voice, chilling her blood. “Is  that was you require? Ah yes, I understand, you need a little proof  to assure yourself before making any commitments. You want to know  if I <em>can</em> bend the rules. Witness carefully, Captain.” Kaori focused on the <em>Backdraft</em> as it sped a little further away, fired random shots at another  ship—the <em>Colonel  Lingus</em>,  by Chuunari’s readout—and boldly announced its actions. Fai-Lynn  of the Tigris screamed and cursed as well, and to top it all off, Mr.  D even encouraged Kaori to call for help. She ordered a full  battalion of race officials to detain the <em>Backdraft</em>,  but never heard so much as a whisper of affirmative, not even after  fifteen straight minutes. Mr. D blasted the envoy from Tigris one  more time before prancing away, smug and bloated with pride.</p>
<p>“Are  you satisfied?” he asked, using a chillingly gentle, even sweet  voice. “Normally those officials would swarm around me like  vultures on a carcass. Just look at what I have wrought, Captain: the <em>Colonel</em> is flailing, her pilot is frantic, all three of our parties have  summoned the referees with everything we have, and yet I can still  fly, as free as a bird. If you join me, even for a moment of  beautiful vengeance for all the people those pirates have ruined, I  will personally guarantee your immunity. I await your decision.”</p>
<p>Chuunaru’s  crew was stunned, to say the least, and not a single one was strong  enough to seriously call a bluff. Everything they knew about right  and wrong had suddenly been jerked out from underneath  them—everything they stood for was mocking them, slapping them in  the face, and jeering. Kaori tried to assemble her thoughts and  approach this scientifically. Tigris was not </p>
<p>especially  powerful in the grand scheme of things, and might have been ignored  because of this. She wondered what would happen if the <em>Backdraft</em> fired on the Ozmund ship, or Lord Demise’s, or the Sindar envoy, or  even hers. Would <em>their</em> influence save them? But she didn’t want to test this man any  further. Fear was starting to control her now, fear of the safety of  others, and she imagined that if she refused this offer, the <em>Backdraft</em> would use its invulnerability against all the ships, and mow them  down. That this scenario was within the realm of possibility  terrified her the most, and with a great heave of reluctance, she  accepted his offer.</p>
<p><em>I  just hope he’s satisfied only fighting the </em>Bloody  Dove. <em>If  I have to compromise my beliefs, I may as well eliminate an enemy  while I’m at it.</em></p>
<p>“You’ve  made me a happy man, Captain,” Mr. D exclaimed softly. “My  master will be pleased. But Rose is dangerous, as I’m sure you’re  aware, so I’ve enlisted some extra protection. I’m not asking  you to befriend anybody today, Captain, least of all myself. Just  try to get along, will you? She should be coming along soon—you <em>have</em> met Shandra Hill, haven’t you?”</p>
<p align="center">………</p>
<p>“It’s  a dangerous place to pass through even under the best circumstances,”  Shandra said quietly, mostly to pass the time and break the  discomforting silence. “As you’ve learned in physics, every body  orbiting a star has its own gravity, and every body orbiting another  body also has gravity. Most of these ‘satellite systems’ are  arranged so that neither body will ever be able to pull the other  towards itself, but sometimes you run across a deviant such as Hagan  6. I’m not saying the moon will ever crash into it, but they’re  so close together that their respective gravity fields meet about  once a month, when the moon is at perigee, and the two fields play  tug of war with whatever’s caught in between. Do you see the  deviousness of this area?”</p>
<p>Kaori  nodded her head silently; she knew exactly what the bounty hunter was  talking about and had even experienced “gravity tug” once before,  when a superior officer was forced to fly into a binary planet’s  orbit. Of course, that sensation would probably be much stronger  than what she would feel right now, if she went along with Mr. D’s  plan, but regardless of its strength, it wasn’t something she  wanted to go through again. According to the <em>Backdraft’s</em> design, Shandra and Kaori would assault Rose from two sides while she  was clearing this difficult obstacle, and several other ships were  promised as backup. Chuunaru still carried some moral dilemmas with  her, but her excitement was overpowering her reason: she was so  close to capturing that loathsome pirate that little else seemed to  matter.</p>
<p>Shandra  Hill,  on the other hand, was not quite as concerned about what was  right or wrong; she couldn’t really afford to in her line of work.  Once, during her early years, she even did something she knew full  well was evil, but it was either that or perish, and she had chosen  her own survival. She had a mountain of regrets but tried to justify  all her decisions based on what really needed to be done at the time.  Would this benefit her, or her sister-in-law, or her niece? Would  it ultimately turn out for the best, regardless of the actions she  took prior to completion? Would some good come from it, or would  some greater evil be taken away? She didn’t feel the need to  juggle those thoughts now, though: the race and its rules were  completely meaningless to her. She hadn’t put any serious thoughts  into capturing Rose during the event, but now that she had allies,  and some degree of protection, it was full speed ahead, and damn the  torpedoes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So  have you ever fought against the Dead Roses?” Kaori asked.</p>
<p>“No,  but I’ve faced my share of pirates. I hear you tangled with them.”</p>
<p>“It  didn’t end well,” Kaori grunted. “They had help: the <em>Dauntless</em>,  one of the ships in this race. Supposedly, they have at least six  wanted criminals onboard.”</p>
<p>“I’m  not interested in the <em>Dauntless</em>. Nobody’s paying me to go after them.” She didn’t mention that  she wouldn’t go after that ship even if the Vicegerent of Nurogrim  offered his entire fortune to her, not even if it was entirely  peopled by criminals. What was left of her family meant that much to  her…and besides, she trusted her niece, and had taught her well.</p>
<p>“Well,  I don’t care about any reward,” Kaori sighed solemnly. “You  can keep the money if you want. I just want to see their heads on a  chopping block.”</p>
<p>“Are  you birds finished chirping?” sang Mr. D impatiently. “One of  our allies has sited the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>,  so wrap up your sewing circle and move into position.”</p>
<p>“Copy,”  Hill said.</p>
<p>“And  what will you be doing?” Kaori asked.</p>
<p>“I  will be supporting everybody. I will run circles around their ship  and confuse them. I will punch holes in their shields and tear open  their sails. I will do whatever I have to. Do you follow me?”</p>
<p>“I  guess we all have the same job, then. All right, crew, move to  coordinates 64-68-17 and go into silent running. Coordinate attack  pattern Phi on my mark, and whatever you do, don’t let her get  away.”</p>
<p>“I’m  still not so sure about this, Captain,” said first gunner. “I  mean, what kind of example is the <em>military</em> showing by breaking these rules?”</p>
<p>“I  understand your concern, and I’ve prepared an explanation in case  we are spotted. Besides, I’d like to see how far Mr. D’s  immunity will last him. We won’t stay in the battle long—just  enough to scorch the <em>Dove</em> and give the impression we’re fighting. Our allies can do as they  please, but I’ve decided that for the moment, the <em>Stormrider</em> will act as a defensive and rescue frigate.”</p>
<p>“Not  a bad arrangement,” the helmswoman commented. “You really think  of everything, don’t you Captain?”</p>
<p>“I  do my best. All right, we’ll be in position in T-minus forty. Everybody buckle down and brace for zero gee.” Kaori knew that the  best way to attack an enemy was to make the enemy think you weren’t  there at all, so in order to avoid detection, she was going to shut  the ship’s power down, and would rely on time—and some luck—to  assist her. Of course, without power, the ship’s shields, weapons,  and artificial gravity would be lost, so they had to be prepared and  act fast. Her stomach did a little flip from the weightlessness, and  anything that wasn’t held down slowly floated in the air (a few  items were caught by the crew). Now all they had to do was wait for  Shandra’s signal, and hope they would be able to get away with  this.</p>
<p><em>I  am doing the right thing. I am doing the right thing. I’m going  to capture a dangerous threat to society. I’m going to watch this  person and make sure they don’t abuse this ability of theirs. I’ve  got to be doing the right thing. I just have to.</em></p>
<p>“Captain? I think I just saw Miss Hill’s signal.” Kaori snapped out of  her delirium and thrust herself into action. She hadn’t realized  her inner monologue had lasted so long, or that she would completely  neglect the battle erupting in front of her. The <em>Stormrider</em> emerged from hiding, reactivated its power, and sent two precision  bolts flying after the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>,  just as Kaori had planned. It stopped attacking and kept the enemy  ship from running, and if the <em>Dove</em> somehow pulled off a lucky shot, she went in to support the injured.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’ve  got to be doing the right thing,” she muttered to herself, over and  over again. “I have to. My superiors would understand. The  Director would understand. My crew knows my intentions; I’m not  breaking these rules because I really want to. I’m cautious. I’m  observing. I’m just in support.”</p>
<p><em>You’re  in denial,</em> her conscience told her, and Chuunaru instantly knew it was true. Her  uncertainty had caused her to fly into this moral tailspin; she  never acted this way whenever she was really sure about anything. Even  though she was going after one danger while trying to guard  another, she knew in her heart that this was the wrong course of  action—and yet she dared not retreat.</p>
<p>“Captain? Captain!! We’re  picking up three other ships in the fray!” Once again she broke out of  her trance, feeling cold and sick to her  stomach, and only managed to compose herself because so many eyes  were upon her.</p>
<p>“What’s  their registration?” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“Uh,  give me a second… Ah! It’s the <em>Bulldozer,  Dauntless,</em> and <em>Elegant  Clio</em>. Do you think they’re here to help us, too?”</p>
<p>“I  don’t care,” she murmured. “Break away from the attack. We  have no business being here.”</p>
<p>“If  you say so,” he replied doubtfully. Kaori watched numbly as the  newcomers swept in and joined the fight—not to attack the Dead  Roses, but to defend them. She ordered for an open channel and  listened in on their broadcasts, and was quite amused by the  exchange.</p>
<p>“Just  look at you all! Five ships ganging up on a defenseless vessel—and  a woman’s vessel, at that! You should be ashamed of yourselves!”</p>
<p>“My  Heavyworld friend is right! Ladies should be loved and honored, not  massacred! Where are your manners? Is chivalry so dead? C’mon,  Mack, let’s kick their butts!”</p>
<p>“You  do realize these are criminals and pirates, right?!” snapped Saki  Yrhol. “What the hell’re you guys defending <em>them</em> for?”</p>
<p>“A  woman’s a woman, no matter how you look at it!” came Demise’s  puckish voice. “Now if you’d like to step out and wrestle Rose  in person, well…that’s a whole nother’ matter!”</p>
<p>“Criminals  or not, they’re still our friends,” Kay Acheron added.</p>
<p>“You  have to wonder what the race officials are doing,” Tee replied, “or  the UCM for that matter! Hang on!”</p>
<p>“Open  a  line,” Kaori commanded, as if she had been waiting for that cue. “We’re  going to correct our errors. I just hope nobody realizes  what we did here.”</p>
<p>“Line  open, Captain!”</p>
<p>“Attention,  all vessels! This is the United Cosmic Military envoy <em>Stormrider</em>,  commanded by Captain Kaori Chuunaru! You are in violation of rule  87-B, Article three of the Galactic Space Race guidelines, forbidding  excessive aggression against your fellow racers! While even the  military is bound to this rule, if you do not cease your attack on  the vessel registered ‘Bloody Dove’, we will have no choice but  to detain you and present you to a race tribunal! You will comply  within five standard minutes before we use force!”</p>
<p>“Speak  of the devil!” Mack exclaimed. “You all sure did get here quick! These four jokers have been ganging up on the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>! We were just helping her out, Cap’n!”</p>
<p>“Regardless  of your intentions, please distance yourselves and continue with the  race, all of you. Further misconduct will not be tolerated.”</p>
<p>“What  sweet hypocrisy, Captain!” cackled Mr. D. Kaori barked out for her  crew to fire a warning shot; the <em>Backdraft</em> was singed and clumsily wobbled away, swearing retribution. As </p>
<p>Chuunaru  turned her sights on the remaining aggressors, they quickly followed  suit and flew away as fast as they could, relieved and enraged and  utterly betrayed. Her shoulders slumped with relief, and she picked  up her transmitter for what was possibly the most difficult  conversation she would ever have.</p>
<p>“<em>Bloody  Dove</em>,  are you functional?”</p>
<p>“You’ll  have to excuse us, Captain Chu-chu,” Rose answered bitterly: “we’re sort of drowning in the irony here. I don’t know  whether to resent you or thank you.”</p>
<p>“I  don’t  expect your thanks, Dead Rose,” Kaori snarled. “I didn’t  save you out of charity or honor. It was just my duty, nothing more.  And…I saw him attack another ship without being stopped, so I  needed to exercise caution.”</p>
<p>“Go  fuck yourself with your lame-ass excuses, and leave me alone. I’ve  got better things to do.”</p>
<p>“Then  I guess we’ll meet again once the race is over.”</p>
<p>“You  can  count on it. Damn, why are all the sexy ones stiff-assed  bitches?” Kaori cut off the transmission and masked her face. Putting  up with Rose’s foul mouth and misguided flirtations was bad  enough, but now she was burdened with all that guilt. Regardless of  her later actions, or how she justified it all, she had broken the  rules and would wallow in that shame until somebody found out.</p>
<p>“Get  through this checkpoint, on the double,” she ordered coldly. “Once  we’re clear of the binary gravity, send a transmission to the  Director. I need to take responsibility for what I did.” Kaori’s  crew was still for a moment. They loved their Captain and were very  loyal to her, mostly because she followed the military’s guidelines  and was proud to serve with all her heart. Yes, she was  uncompromising and even merciless, but she was also reliable, and  believed in real truth and real justice, and she cared very deeply  for those under her command. After this fiasco, however, it was  likely they would not serve under her for some time.</p>
<p>“Understood,  Captain. We will be outside the pull in thirty-seven minutes.”</p>
<p align="center">………</p>
<p>If  Rose  Gillian wasn’t enthralled with the Acheron twins yet, being  saved from certain death by them pushed her well over the edge. Their  date on Hagan 6 was a surprising one, and not just because Rose  was so open about it. They dressed conservatively in dark, muted  colors, and Tee put makeup on her sister to “spruce things up”—but  Rose stole their breath away when she greeted them in a dazzling red  evening gown. Her long golden hair had been looped and tied and  knotted up, revealing a strong neck and a firm jaw; her eyes  glimmered like the sea as the bright sunlight reveals every wave; a  white flower was in her hair, and soon Rose gave flowers to her  dates. The Acheron twins were rarely treated like normal people, so  they were pretty much floored as this exotic lady poured her  attention over them.</p>
<p>Shockingly,  Rose had a strong passion for opera, and she wasn’t shy about her  emotional replies. She laughed, wept, and groaned openly, and  sometimes flirted with the two sisters when she thought no one was  looking. During intermission, she answered their questions about her  crew and her ship, flattered that these two beauties would show that  much concern, but didn’t say much else. She was completely  hypnotized by the twins and seemed reluctant to take her eyes off  them. This was as different from the standard ugly stares as Rose  was different from their </p>
<p>childhood  tormentors. If she hadn’t been a half-crazed pirate, they might  have believed she was honestly in love with them.</p>
<p>The  twins gave in to her love that night, or perhaps it was Rose who was  overcome by it—but either way, their nocturnal activities  intensified with every dark hour that passed. None of them could  resist the other. Rose was selfless and caring, and treasured every  touch and kiss and caress as if it were her first; the twins,  however, were greedy, and slurped it all up out of desperation and  fear. They had never been in the thralls of pure ecstasy before and  they did not believe it would happen again. Sleep provided some  comfort—eventually—but Rose was insatiable, and woke her lovers  with pleasant kisses all over their body. They resumed their  progress in the bathroom—and the shower—and the kitchen—and the  den—and anywhere else the Acheron women could think of. It took  two days of dating and lovemaking to wear them both out; they were  amazed at their own energy.</p>
<p>On  the morning of the third day, when everyone else aboard the <em>Dauntless</em> were rested and ready to resume the race, Kay and Tee woke in their  bed, naked and disheveled and suddenly feeling lonely. Rose had  finally abandoned them and went ahead, but not before planting a  gorgeous orange flower upon their breast, and attaching a note to it.  They both smelled like her; by now, the twins had memorized Rose’s  scent and would carry it for the rest of their lives. The note read:</p>
<p><em>“To  my two goddesses: let’s not slander our experience with words. I  couldn’t hope to describe it with my eloquence, or anybody else’s,  for that matter! Just promise we’ll see each other again, even if  I have to resort to kidnapping! Why not join me while you’re at  it? You’d both make terrific pirates, and I know the others would  love to have you. Think about it. In the meantime, show me what  you’re made of and give me a race to remember. If you manage to  beat me, I’ll give you something special. If I beat you…well,  you might still get something nice. (Wink!) Lustfully yours, R.”</em></p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Kaori  decided to take a long, hot bath while she still had the luxury of  time. These races were not designed to be completed in one go—even  the most advanced spaceship had to stop for fuel, repairs, and  supplies. Her crew was given leave to do as they pleased, and were  scheduled to meet onboard the <em>Stormrider</em> at 1000 the next morning. She sat through her meeting with the  Director first, and planned to let the stress of the past few hours  slip away later. Taking a bath, even a short one, was a rarity in  her line of work, and cleansing herself with real hot water, and not  the tepid trickling military showers offered, was something she would  not miss. There was a glass of wine on the floor and a plate of  delicacies next to it, and she dined carefully as she ran over the  warnings Astor had presented.</p>
<p>“Yes,  Captain Chuunaru, is there something I can do for you?”</p>
<p>“Director,  I’m reporting a temporary violation of rule 87-B, Article three of  the Galactic Space Race guidelines. Six of the race participants  attacked another ship without just cause, but fortunately, I was able  to break them up and save the victim from further abuse.”</p>
<p>“Are  you sure? I’ve been monitoring this race as carefully as I can,  and I never heard anything about this.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I  am certain, Director. At 1325 hours today, just outside the second  checkpoint located between Hagan 6 and its moon, the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> was attacked by the following vessels: <em>Backdraft,  Opportune Rain, Screaming Skull, Prince Mishkin, </em>and<em> Domination</em>.  Please check my records if you don’t believe me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll  have someone look into that once the race is over. But you said  there were six ships, Captain, and you only listed five.” Kaori  breathed deeply and braced herself for the worst.</p>
<p>“The  sixth was my ship, Director. I also attacked the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>.”</p>
<p>“I  was afraid so,” Astor muttered. “Go ahead and give me your  reason, then, and it had better be good.”</p>
<p>“Yes,  ma’am. Prior to the attack, the pilot of the <em>Backdraft</em>,  who we believe is a man named Kaz Derada, came to my ship and offered  an alliance against the Dead Roses. He proceeded to explain that he  could completely avoid the detection of the race officials, and  promptly proved his claims by attacking the <em>Colonel  Lingus</em>. Despite my best efforts, I was not able to summon any assistance. May I inquire about its present condition?”</p>
<p>“The <em>Colonel</em> is fine, Captain, though her pilot is infuriated. Tell me, why  didn’t you apprehend the <em>Backdraft</em> right then and there?”</p>
<p>“I  apologize, Director, but I was selfish, frightened, and a victim of  my passions. I believed that Derada would attack more ships unless I  agreed to his conditions, and so I went along with his plan, but I  accredit most of the fault to my own desires. I wanted the Dead  Roses captured and killed, ma’am, and I regret to say I might’ve  done worse things to achieve this goal. I accept full responsibility  for it all, and—“</p>
<p>“That  will be enough, Captain. I’ve heard everything I need to.” Kaori swallowed nervously.</p>
<p>“Yes,  ma’am.” Clarissa sighed and pushed her glasses up so they  wouldn’t aggravate her nose.</p>
<p>“How  old are you, Chuunaru? Twenty-five, twenty-seven? You’re still  young, you know, so don’t feel like you have to carry yourself like  someone my age. Of course you’ll fall prey to your passions, and  your desires, and sometimes you won’t even have the willpower to  back away at all. You said that you later broke up the offenders?”</p>
<p>“Yes,  ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Then  it seems to me you realized your mistake, and corrected it before any  real damage could be done. You <em>have</em> performed shamefully, Captain, but you were also wise enough, and <em>good</em> enough, to see your error and back away. You even reported your  actions directly to me, without any instruction. I’d say that, all  things considered, you have qualities many of your superiors seem to  lack. You will be haunted by this failure, Chuunaru, but you must  also remember this quiet triumph you’ve achieved. It’s all part  of being human.”</p>
<p>Kaori  stood before the monitor, stunned, unable to form words or thoughts  or even a facial expression. Finally, she croaked out, “Thank you,  ma’am,” and saluted slowly. Astor did not smile, but she didn’t  really frown either; she was clothed in a cautious joy that could  only be seen through her eyes.</p>
<p>“Be  careful, Captain,” she whispered as warning. “There are many  forces in this life that can twist your thoughts and make you believe  things you would otherwise never even consider. You are young, and I  believe you are trying to do the right thing, but you’ll soon find  out that’s not always a clear concept. Mind yourself against  temptation, Chuunaru: it’s the deadliest power out there. I know  you won’t disappoint me again. Oh, and Chuunaru? Please enjoy the  last race.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kaori  finally managed to smile. “Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>And  now she sighed as her memory came to an end.</p>
<p>“I  won’t fail again. I’m going to make her proud of me. I will  regain my honor.”</p>
<p>She  dried off, got dressed, and went into her bedroom.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview  of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Herut: Talk about a cop-out! We weren’t even <em>mentioned!</em></p>
<p>Athena: Pretty soon the focus will move away from us entirely. We’ll move  into the realm of forgotten relics.</p>
<p>Rachel: Not again!</p>
<p>Herut:  Well, I guess we can have a chapter like this every once in awhile. We  really got into Kaori’s head. Thankfully, it appears as if the  next chapter is all about the crew again.</p>
<p>Athena: Riene fans rejoice.</p>
<p>Rachel: Does this story even <em>have</em> any fans?</p>
<p>Herut: Uh…</p>
<p>Athena: Hmm…</p>
<p>Rachel: …Yikes. Not even one?!</p>
<p>Athena: Please stay tuned for the next chapter, “Space Race: drifters”,  even if you’re the only one.</p>
<p>Rachel: Your family is your fans!</p>
<p>Herut: Uh, yeah, I’m an artificially-created construct.</p>
<p>Athena: Despite the breeding habits of my species, I don’t have any family  either.</p>
<p>Rachel: Urgh… Just how much room is there in that relic place?</p>
