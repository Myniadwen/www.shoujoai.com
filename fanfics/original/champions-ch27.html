<h1>Champions (part 27 of 56)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/champions-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>Taichou

The Director of MERCS&#151;a man who only addressed himself as Taichou&#151;sat 
patiently as Sayonada Kogure, his long-time friend, father figure, and 
benefactor, peered over the week&#39;s statistics. They had been meeting 
regularly for over a year now, discussing plans and the development of 
their secret pet project, which only they and Dr. Kamaguchi knew about. 
Taichou was a very skinny, black-haired man, his body developed 
fanatically into one of wiry strength. He was the kind to sit quietly at 
a desk and direct things from afar, a subtle yet strong force in MERCS, 
one which the organization could not live without&#151;and Sayonada was in a 
way the power behind the throne.

&quot;I see that tournament did wonders to boost the progress of Yohko&#39;s 
crusade,&quot; murmured Kogure as he scanned the status sheets. &quot;Pandora did 
an excellent job, but I think the true hero was this Ferret person. Tell 
me, is Ferret still around? I would like to speak with him or her, and 
congratulate them. This is outstanding work.&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately, the Ferret&#39;s contract expired,&quot; answered Taichou. &quot;But 
while she was still with us, she was one of our most valuable employees. 
Naturally, I...took those liberties during that time.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so this Ferret had those types of skills, huh? No wonder you hired 
them&#151;or should I say, her? Two birds with one stone.&quot;

&quot;More like a whole flock, but that&#39;s beside the point. To be honest, I 
didn&#39;t just call this meeting to have you check up on me. Dr. 
Kamaguchi&#39;s arsenal has just achieved idealism.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;You recall her talking about the three whom she wanted to employ more 
than anybody else, right? Well von Zomren was easy&#151;she jumped at the 
chance of working with Yohko. Apparently they hit it off really well. 
And you know we have one of the other two right here at base; well, 
we&#39;ve finally managed to track down the last one.&quot;

&quot;Who might that be?&quot; he asked. Taichou gestured to his speakerphone.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you ask them to come inside and see for yourself?&quot; Kogure did 
so, paging Yui Miyamoto who escorted two young girls into an anteroom 
(mysteriously, Taichou&#39;s reclusive behavior limited only Sayonada and 
Dr. Kamaguchi to see his face, but apparently he trusted the girls). 
Sayonada stood up politely, even though the girls, fourteen and twelve 
respectively, were young enough to be his granddaughters. He knew better 
than to second-guess his old friend.

&quot;Sit,&quot; bade Taichou; the girls found chairs next to the older man as 
they were announced. &quot;My friend, permit me to introduce you to a great 
potential employee, Aura Valeria, and our current ward, Kamaguchi&#39;s 
supposed favorite, Joyce Jameson.&quot;

&quot;Hi!&quot; chirped Aura, taking Sayonada&#39;s hand. Joyce declined to speak.

&quot;And what exactly do they do?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s been reported that Aura, who calls herself Lady Luck, 
affects that very vitality when she is around; she literally makes 
people lucky, merely with her presence or concentration. Naturally, this 
had made her something of an unwilling celebrity.&quot;

&quot;Unwilling indeed,&quot; said the girl, rubbing a short shuck of jetty hair 
to her left. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll end up working here. I really only came 
to help somebody.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do to convince you otherwise,&quot; said Taichou 
mysteriously. He then resumed, gravely: &quot;Joyce, on the other hand, has a 
power too terrible to describe or demonstrate. It would be better for 
you to observe the man she unleashed the full brunt of her abilities on, 
or what&#39;s left of him.&quot;

&quot;Do you mean that one case in Trent Asylum?&quot;

&quot;So you have seen it.&quot; Sayonada shuddered.

&quot;Seen, but not believed. That man... Just looking at him made me weep. 
Are you saying that this girl...&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; murmured Taichou darkly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, she usually has fair 
control over her powers. Apparently she does not like using them, not 
that I can blame her. A kid her age shouldn&#39;t be...oh, forgive me!&quot; he 
exclaimed suddenly, laughing. &quot;I&#39;m getting off on another tangent, 
aren&#39;t I? Well, the point is that they&#39;re here, and if I can just make 
my sales pitch to Lady Luck here&#151;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Aura, rising from her seat. &quot;I don&#39;t work that way. 
I&#39;m a living person, not a tool to be used as you see fit. I give my 
skills to those who need it.&quot;

&quot;But Aura, surely you must know the corrupted state the world is in.&quot;

&quot;Of course, I see it every day. That&#39;s why I do what I do, to the people 
who need it.&quot;

&quot;But with MERCS, you could do so much more.&quot;

&quot;I have no desire for more power. I&#39;m quite content with what I have. 
Nobody should do more than what they were created for.&quot; Taichou&#39;s lips 
pressed together in thought, in disappointment. Aura wasn&#39;t being 
stubborn, but he knew she could do more good for him than for anybody 
else. Again he tried.

&quot;With our resources, we can send you where you&#39;re needed. Plenty of our 
employees desperately need luck on their side.&quot;

&quot;Your employees are largely endowed with supernatural gifts,&quot; said Aura 
deadpan. &quot;The people I help are no more special than anyone else not 
born with such &#39;talents&#39;. Therefore, they need it more than your people 
do.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m sure we could help you find&#151;&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need help. I&#39;m quite fine on my own. I apologize if I sound 
rude, but this sort of talk really ruffles my feathers.&quot;

&quot;Is that your final answer?&quot;

&quot;I doubt you could get me to reconsider.&quot; Taichou frowned again, leaned 
back in his chair, and sucked on a pencil, contemplative. Sayonada had 
merely watched; Joyce appeared invisible, which, from the look of her 
withdrawn face, was just the way she liked it. Finally the dark-haired 
man leaned forward again, a smile on his face.

&quot;Aura, could I ask you for one simple favor?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Even if you don&#39;t work for us, Joyce is still under our care. She 
hasn&#39;t even spoken since that incident, not even to those kind to her, 
and there&#39;s nobody even remotely close to her age that stays here 
long-term. Maybe you could take care of her.&quot; Aura crossed her arms, and 
looked to the younger girl. Joyce was pathetic, even for a pre-teenager: 
she had very messy hair splotched in dark colors, and the faded pink 
shirt she wore was a few sizes too big. A single, flimsy braid held most 
of her hair in an unattractive tail; the rest shuffled as she shied 
further away. Her hands clutched a teddy bear protectively, and aside 
from a few quiet squeaks, she had not said a word.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; murmured Aura. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind looking after her for 
today, but wouldn&#39;t something long-term be up to her?&quot;

&quot;At the moment, Miss Jameson is incapable of making those kinds of 
decisions. She does not respond to anything.&quot; Aura thought about this 
and looked at Joyce again. She tried staring into her face, but Joyce 
just looked away.

&quot;Joyce? What do you think?&quot; Silence. &quot;Joyce? Would it be okay?&quot;

&quot;Try it out just for today,&quot; said Taichou. &quot;I understand if you don&#39;t 
want to help us, but please, at least help Joyce.&quot;

&quot;What about her parents? Does she have any family?&quot;

&quot;No. Her mother died in childbirth and her father was killed several 
weeks earlier. She doesn&#39;t have anybody else. Miss Miyamoto is her legal 
guardian, though they&#39;ve drifted apart since that incident.&quot;

&quot;What incident?&quot; Taichou took a deep breath.

&quot;About two months ago, one of our crew was with Joyce on a walk outside. 
She&#39;s quite frail, as you can see, and we figured she could use the 
exercise. They were attacked, though, by robbers. The crewmember was 
killed, and for that...one of the robbers was permanently disabled by 
Miss Jameson&#39;s incredible powers. She couldn&#39;t control herself. The 
others got away; we presume they&#39;re still out there, but too frightened 
to reveal themselves. Joyce hasn&#39;t spoken since. Even if the person she 
harms is evil, she is still sensitive about it, and hates using her 
power even for the shortest time, even on the worst person imaginable.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s awful...&quot; Aura sucked in air as she gasped quietly. Looking at 
Joyce for a third time&#151;seeing how terrified she now looked, how 
withdrawn and bashful&#151;Aura couldn&#39;t help but feel for the kid, and 
wanted to help. She didn&#39;t like being taken advantage of, but this poor, 
unfortunate girl needed her, even if just as a friend. Aura took a 
breath and agreed: she would be Joyce&#39;s caretaker and would try and 
befriend her.

Lady Luck had no idea what she was getting into...

.........

&quot;Taichou, are you sure it&#39;s wise to let them go like that? If that girl 
is half as bad as you say she is&#151;&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not bad, Sayonada,&quot; replied the younger man coolly. The only 
window in his room offered little peace as he stared out of it; it 
merely looked at another section of the building, and hardly let in any 
sunlight. &quot;Her power is just...&quot;

&quot;Dangerous?&quot; he suggested.

&quot;I was about to say &#39;wild&#39;...but there&#39;s really no difference. You can 
relax, though. I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry about. She 
probably will never do that again, unless something awful happens to 
her. But she has luck on her side, does she not?&quot; The older man 
snort-laughed.

&quot;If I see a whole list of vegetated people in the papers tomorrow, I&#39;ll 
know where to point the finger.&quot;

&quot;Come on, you know this is all for a good cause. The specimens I&#39;ve 
already collected should make you pleased. These next two will just make 
it all the better. With every person bearing special powers that passes 
through my door, or comes into contact with our dear Dr. Kamaguchi, the 
Militaristic Enterprise for the Reformation of Civilization and Society 
grows stronger. We&#39;ll have achieved our goal before long.&quot;

&quot;And what is that exactly? Come on, both you and the, uh, doctor keep me 
in the dark about this. You shouldn&#39;t give me, of all people, vague 
answers.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s simply what our organization stands for, Kogure,&quot; said Taichou 
airily.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t the &#39;R&#39; stand for Revenge?&quot; Taichou smirked knowingly.

&quot;Ssh. That&#39;s supposed to be a secret between the three of us.&quot;

&quot;You are canny, Director. Oh, I almost forgot. We have two 
representatives from the, uh, organizations I mentioned earlier here 
with us. Something about how all of you conspired in secret to further 
your plans.&quot;

&quot;There was no conspiracy; I merely had my agents overhear a few things, 
and planned accordingly.&quot;

&quot;Well, they both want to talk with you, for different reasons. Should I 
let them in?&quot;

&quot;But of course. I&#39;d be happy to see them both&#151;but one at a time.&quot; 
Taichou sat back down and waited for Yui to guide the visitors into the 
anteroom. One stepped inside, nodding slightly. Taichou beamed and 
smiled, spreading his arms as if welcoming back a brother.

&quot;Lord Avarice! What a pleasant surprise to see you! How can my humble 
actions help you today?&quot;

.........

The day was beautiful, but only Aura was enjoying it. She was skipping 
and smiling, glad to be in such good weather, but Joyce hung back, 
barely even trudging as she cast her face down and followed her new 
caretaker. It had been the first time since the incident she was allowed 
to go outside, and normally that would&#39;ve cheered her. Aura paid her 
little mind until later, when the two came to a stop. They had taken a 
loop around the building and were in the garage, where Aura had a Vespa 
parked. She climbed on and offered Joyce a helmet, but the girl declined 
with a firm shake of her head.

&quot;I was thinking maybe we could go somewhere,&quot; Valeria said. &quot;I heard you 
were cooped up in this building for a long time. I would hate that. Hey, 
I know! How bout&#39; we get some ice cream, huh? Would you like that?&quot; 
Joyce made no movement, except to squeeze her bear tighter, so Aura just 
assumed that not saying No meant Yes. &quot;Well, climb on, and hold tight. I 
don&#39;t go very fast, but you never know. I know a great place.&quot; Joyce 
still refused, but Aura was persistent. She touched the younger girl and 
offered her best smile; Joyce slipped away.

&quot;It&#39;s my treat, Aura. I promise I won&#39;t go fast. Are you scared? Look, 
you can trust me. I want to look out for you. Let&#39;s do something fun 
together so that we can be friends. Would you like that? I know I would. 
Come on.&quot; Joyce peered up briefly, and noticed that aside from the 
friendly, pretty face, Aura had eyes colored differently: one solid 
gold, the other a firm, bright blue. Her hair, though mostly black, also 
had pretty white streaks in it, probably a dye, and her skin, if Joyce 
looked carefully (which she didn&#39;t), had miniscule runes etched on it. 
They were too fine to be tattoos, too broad and complex to be 
birthmarks. Aura noticed Joyce staring and blushed.

&quot;Oh. Uh...it&#39;s just something I got when I, uh, found out about my 
powers. Listen, if you really don&#39;t want to ride with me, I won&#39;t force 
you.&quot; Joyce looked a little less apprehensive, and climbed on behind 
Aura, silently fitting her helmet. Valeria smiled. &quot;All right, awesome! 
Well then, let&#39;s get going! Hold on tight!&quot;

Joyce had to admit, she enjoyed the ride over. For a girl only two years 
older than her, Aura really knew how to drive, and seemed to have 
amazingly good fortune with traffic lights (granted, she loved using her 
powers in situations such as those). The ice cream store was a smaller 
chain than normal, but they offered quality treats at good prices, and 
had a small but excellent choice of flavors. The workers knew Aura well 
and welcomed her; she introduced Joyce and took a moment to decide what 
she wanted.

&quot;You can have anything you want!&quot; she exclaimed happily. &quot;Really, sky&#39;s 
the limit.&quot; Joyce was still tongue-tied, but she looked a little more 
relaxed in the small, foreign setting. &quot;Take your time,&quot; Aura said 
softly, sensing her new friend&#39;s discomfort. &quot;There&#39;s no rush. We have 
all day. Do you mind if I order first? I&#39;m sort of craving some butter 
pecan.&quot; Joyce shook her head, and Aura got her treat in five minutes. 
She even offered a small spoonful to Joyce, who finally broke out a 
timid smile as she swallowed the treat.

&quot;Good?&quot; The girl nodded. &quot;See, I told you. Let&#39;s find a seat somewhere; 
you can decide from there.&quot; Joyce nodded and followed Aura to the table, 
where the older girl, after taking a few hasty bites and nearly getting 
a headache, promptly interrogated her about her life.

&quot;So what do you like to do for fun? ...Uh, you like music, books? ...Any 
movies you like? ...Or should I shut up? ...I wanna get to know you, but 
if you&#39;d rather not talk, that&#39;s fine.&quot; Joyce sighed and stared at the 
table. She traced imaginary lines on it with her finger.

&quot;I&#39;ve made up my mind,&quot; she whispered at long last. Her voice came so 
suddenly and so weakly that Aura almost didn&#39;t hear it: &quot;I&#39;d like some 
strawberry, please.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Okay. Uh...in a cone or a cup?&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get a cone. Anything else?&quot; Joyce smiled very weakly.

&quot;Sprinkles.&quot;

&quot;Got it. Be right back.&quot; Joyce smiled to herself and hugged her bear 
close while waiting. Aura came back soon, the treat in hand, and gave it 
and a napkin to her new friend. Joyce whispered a thanks and slurped it 
quietly. Aura was left to eat in silence, at least until Joyce had 
devoured enough to start chewing on the cone.

&quot;I was named after my mother,&quot; she said quietly. Aura stopped eating, 
wanting to savor the conversation more than the ice cream. &quot;My 
mother&#151;who died while giving birth to me&#151;her name was Joyce as well. I 
was an orphan the moment I came out&#151;they had to do a C-section to save 
me&#151;and since I didn&#39;t have any relatives to give me a name, the doctors 
just decided to name me after my mother. That&#39;s where it comes from.&quot;

&quot;Oh. My name comes from the shining resilience and determination I had 
when I was born. I wasn&#39;t even supposed to survive, but...miracles were 
with me that day, and every day since. Actually, if you want my full 
name, it&#39;s Aura Miracle Valeria, though I think it&#39;s a little silly.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s pretty,&quot; said Joyce, her smile now in full. She lifted her bear, 
tilting it gently for her new friend to see. &quot;He doesn&#39;t have a name. I 
just call him Bear. Miss Miyamoto gave it to me when I moved in with 
her. I didn&#39;t have anybody to take care of me, so I was an orphan until 
Miss Miyamoto came by and adopted me. But I don&#39;t call her mom or 
anything, and she doesn&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Oh. I don&#39;t really have any stuffed animals; I gave them all away. 
Normally, girls your age don&#39;t carry them around, but I guess you could 
if you wanted to.&quot; Joyce nodded.

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s strange. He&#39;s the only one I can talk to about 
anything I want, and he won&#39;t give me strange looks or call me names. 
Everyone else does that, even Miss Miyamoto. But at least she tries to 
be nice.&quot;

&quot;What about Dr. Kamaguchi, or Director Taichou?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like anybody else there,&quot; whispered Joyce. &quot;I think they&#39;re 
awful. They treat me so horribly.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, I can imagine. Why don&#39;t you...oh, I guess you couldn&#39;t leave. 
It&#39;s really the only home you have, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;I would leave if I could, but where would I go? I tried running away 
several times...&quot; She trailed off and reverted back to her withdrawn 
self, shunning Aura as her face lowered. She took a few licks of her ice 
cream and numbly chewed on the cone. Aura finished hers and excused 
herself to get a drink. She didn&#39;t want to push her friend into saying 
anything that made her even more uncomfortable.

&quot;Joyce,&quot; she spoke upon returning, &quot;you know I&#39;m your friend, right? You 
know I&#39;d like to help you. I personally hate it when people take 
advantage of my powers, so I think we can relate to each other.&quot;

&quot;So will...you not use them on me?&quot; Aura smiled.

&quot;I think I can make an exception. I feel sympathy for you. I think a 
turn of good fortune is something you need. But I&#39;m your friend first 
and foremost, Joyce&#151;don&#39;t forget that.&quot; Joyce nodded, and finally 
finished her treat. Before Aura could stand to throw them away, Joyce 
beat her to it.

&quot;You&#39;ve been so kind to me,&quot; she whispered. &quot;The least I could do is 
throw this stuff away. Take care of him for me while I&#39;m gone.&quot; Aura 
didn&#39;t have long to wait, and since Joyce asked her, they left the store 
once she returned.

Aura took Joyce to the park and wondered if she wanted to play, but the 
young preteen seemed happier just sitting by herself, away from everyone 
else. At least she did not shy away from Aura, who ran out to play with 
a few kids (all of them benefiting from her radiance of good fortune). 
Joyce just watched, holding her bear and keeping to herself. Aura joined 
her once she was done, not wanting the young girl to be lonely. She 
asked again if her friend wanted to do anything, but got a solid no. 
Eventually they wound up taking another walk, which Miss Jameson was at 
least agreeable to.

Aura tried opening more conversations, but Joyce&#39;s lips were sealed. She 
did say more words, and sometimes talked in long strings of sentences, 
but was taciturn for the most part. Aura was more used to talking with 
chatty people; being with Joyce was a new experience. She at least tried 
to be open-minded about it, and continually told her new friend that 
whatever made her comfortable was okay. Joyce smiled a little easier 
after that, which was progress enough.

&quot;Hey!&quot; An irritating voice called out to the girls; they turned to see a 
man, far older than both of them, approach them with a dangerous smile. 
Joyce whimpered and took a step back, while Aura prepared herself for 
the worst. She had no fighting experience and didn&#39;t want to start 
learning the hard way.

&quot;Can we help you?&quot; she asked. The man ignored her and approached Joyce.

&quot;What do we have here? A little girl, holding a cute little toy bear? 
Lemme see that!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; she shouted, squeezing the toy for dear life. He pushed her to the 
ground and snatched the poor thing up; Aura let out a shout and was 
right there to help Joyce up.

&quot;Hey, give that back, you jerk, and apologize!&quot;

&quot;I think not!&quot; he sang, surly and leery. &quot;I think I&#39;ll keep this. 
What&#39;re you gonna do, call the cops?&quot;

&quot;Give it back!&quot; shouted Joyce, her eyes becoming angry. &quot;Give it back 
now!&quot;

&quot;Or else what? Huh? You gonna cry? Hey! I wonder what would happen if 
I...!&quot; He pulled on the poor toy&#39;s head, stretching it and nearly 
ripping it off. Aura shouted, but Joyce screamed, as if it was her own 
head being mistreated.

&quot;Stop it now!!&quot; she demanded, eyes welling with tears. &quot;Put him down!!&quot;

&quot;Aww, little girl gonna cry?!&quot;

&quot;Give that back NOW!!!&quot; A wave of unimaginable power seemed to shoot out 
directly from Joyce&#39;s forehead, hitting the cruel man full force. Aura 
didn&#39;t notice it at first&#151;she was too enraged and yet too helpless&#151;and 
neither did the man. However, what happened next was brutal. He dropped 
the bear, clutched his head, and started to moan in a low, agonized 
voice. Joyce was livid with rage, staring and frothing madly.

Aura&#39;s eyes flew wide open as she was forced to watch the man scream in 
absolute horror.

Never before had she seen such torture! The man was on the floor, 
writhing and bawling viciously. He clawed at his face, the ground, 
anything&#151;screaming, howling, nearly on the verge of insanity&#151;and Joyce 
stood still as stone, and just as firm, her face contorted in violent 
hatred. Aura finally snapped out of her shock and ran to her friend, 
screaming&#151;&quot;STOP!!!&quot;

Joyce was shaken, and stopped. The overwhelming feeling that had circled 
the air and focused on the man was gone. He laid there, muttering and 
babbling helplessly; Joyce suddenly realized what she had done, and wept 
in sorrow.

&quot;Oh no, not again! I did it again! I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m so sorry! I didn&#39;t 
mean to! Please, please forgive me!&quot; She approached the man, who was 
gradually recovering from his unspeakable ordeal, but as soon as he got 
sight of her, he shrieked and stumbled away.

&quot;Stay back! Keep away from me, you monster! Ah...HELP!!!!&quot; The poor 
creature ran off wildly, leaving Joyce to sob uncontrollably. She sank 
to her knees, grubby hands covering her wet face, and moaned her 
apologies again and again. Aura Valeria was stunned, and sat there 
catatonic as the full scope of what had just happened sunk into her 
mind.

The question was, what would she do now?

----------

To be continued...

What indeed? What exactly is Joyce&#39;s radical power, and how deeply can 
it affect the human psyche? For the moment, other questions need 
resolutions and other problems need addressing. In the land of the dead, 
Rin and Kailin try to come to terms with their situation, and seek help 
from two unusual strangers who may have a way of bringing them back&#151;but 
at what horrible cost? Meanwhile, Lady Snowblood learns of their death, 
and swears to avenge their falling no matter what. But can the Iron 
Arena Games champion stand a chance against the malicious Kali, or will 
she too be obliterated? Many questions will remain unanswered in the 
next chapter, &quot;Kissa and Kali&quot;. Stay tuned!</pre>
