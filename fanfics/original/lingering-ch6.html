<h1>A Shadowlander's Tale: The Lingering Shadows Within (part 6 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/lingering-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>I woke up with a start and sat up straight, checking my arms for 
restraints, to find . I found the IV back in my arm, but other then that 
there was nothing. However something felt different, I glanced around to 
find myself again in a large hospital room. The room was bright with the 
light of a new day, shining through an open window. The curtains were 
pulled back and I could see other patients laying in their beds. One 
person in a arm cast and another with bandages over his eye. This room 
felt like it has more life to it them before, but I could not explain 
why. Then I noticed a bouquet of flowers sitting in a vase on the night 
stand next to my bed, next to my journal. A card stuck out from between 
a couple of the flowers and I plucked it free from its plastic stand as 
I picked up my notebook and I read the card.

&quot;Get well soon.
From everyone at Our Place.&quot; 

I smiled at the card and could feel a tear brim up at the edge of my 
eye. I opened the journal to the last entry to see my final notes from 
the night before. It really was a dream and I really was with Liz and 
Beth. I let out a sigh of relief that I was not truly insane, but that 
still did not explain that dream I just had. I&#39;d had my fair share of 
strange nightmares, but nothing like that before. Then I recalled 
something that I&#39;d dreamed about a few years back and started to flip 
through the book in search of the entry. I stopped on a page marked May 
eleventh, almost two years ago. My eyes fell upon a paragraph and my 
heart felt as if it stopped: 

&quot;I saw its eyes staring out as me from under the bed again. It watched 
me, waiting for me to move. I could sense it wanted to feed on me, but I 
was unwilling to allow it the pleasure. This beast had been waiting for 
me since I was young, I know this now, but I would not and will not ever 
surrender myself to it. Never.&quot; 

I did not recall writing those words and I knew almost every word in 
this book as if it were part of my heart. I&#39;ve found that just by 
writing out my thoughts and dreams I tended to record them in my mind 
forever. That didn&#39;t explain this passage. What was this beast I was 
referring too? Why did I feel it was after me?  I glanced over the page 
until I came across another unusual paragraph. 

&quot;I remember now. She died in that hellish place and I could not help 
her. I remember the way she screamed out as she was tied down to her bed 
and the way she struggled against her restraints as I watched from her 
bedroom door. She had a feeling that she would die that day and even 
told me so. She wanted to be free of this place before death came for 
her, but they caught her just outside of those cold glass doors. As she 
was tied down I could see her eyes pleading to me. Begging me to free 
her, but what was I to do? I was just a small child back then. How was I 
supposed to help her? That night I remember the screams, sounds that I 
must have blocked out of my mind because they hurt my heart and mind so 
dearly. Then they suddenly stopped and a deep silence filled the room. I 
would not find out til the next morning that she was gone. They say she 
escaped, but I do not believe it. She died on that bed and now her soul 
was lost somewhere in the shadows of the night.&quot; 

I shuddered at my own words. I hated not remembering and writing in this 
book was supposed to help, so why could I not remember these entries 
until now. I rubbed at my eyes with the palm of my hand as I hugged the 
opened book to my chest. It made no sense. I was not insane and I knew 
it, but this book, these things I&#39;d written. How could I explain them?

There was a slight rapping at the door and I glanced up to see Liz 
standing before my bed with her hands behind her back and an embarrassed 
look upon her face. Her cloths were rumpled as if she had slept in them 
and there were red bags under her eyes. 

&quot;Liz!!&quot; I exclaimed, excited to see the woman was not a figment of my 
imagination. Maybe all that other stuff was a dream after all and this 
was the reality. I closed my book and placed it at my side, &quot;I&#39;m so glad 
to see you.&quot; I rubbed at the tears the threatened to tumble from my 
eyes. 

Liz rushed around the bed and gave me a tight hug, &quot;I was so worry... 
they made me leave and... I wanted to stay by your side, but you know 
how it is... only family are allowed in...&quot; 

I returned her hug and felt a comfort in the feeling of her warm arms 
around my body. She was real, really real. The feeling of her hand 
stroking the back of my head and smell the scent of her hair was 
relieving. This was real and that other place was just a bad dream. I 
squeezed Liz tightly as I felt myself become overcome by emotion. 

She backed up slightly, leaving her hands on my shoulders, and stared 
into my eyes, &quot;Hey, you alright sweetie?&quot; She asked worriedly. 

&quot;Sweetie?&quot; I gazed into those brown eyes as I watched restlessness fill 
them. She had never called me a nickname before. What brought this on? 
As I pondered this I watched her cheeks take on a shade of crimson and 
she stood up straight. 

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She stammered and paced beside my bed. 

I gave the woman a puzzled look as I watched her carefully, &quot;Are you 
alright?&quot; I inquired, unsure what was going on here exactly. Then I 
recalled Julia telling me that Liz broke up with her girlfriend. Could 
she actually have feelings for me? My heart raced out of control as the 
idea of Liz returning my love sent it into overdrive. 

At that moment a young nurse entered the room, &quot;Well, I see you are 
awake.&quot; She observed, with a warm smile upon her face, &quot;You had quite a 
fall I hear.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; I rubbed the back of my neck in embarrassment, &quot;It&#39;s stupid 
considering I&#39;d just warned someone about that step only a few hours 
earlier.&quot; I remarked foolishly. 

Liz shook her head at me, &quot;You are not stupid.&quot; She stated confidently, 
&quot;You were worried about Beth, just like the rest of us. I would have run 
up those stairs just like you, if it was me.&quot; She admitted with a nod of 
her head, &quot;It could have easily been either of us in the hospital.&quot; 

I flushed lightly at Liz&#39;s confidence in me, &quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot; I 
glanced up at Liz with the recollection of Beth&#39;s disappearance, &quot;Did 
you find Beth?&quot; I inquired hopefully. 

Liz&#39;s face grew long and I knew the answer before she even spoke the 
words, &quot;She never returned. We looked everywhere, but there was no sign 
of her. I spent the entire night in the lobby waiting to be allowed to 
see you.&quot; She explained sheepishly, &quot;I called Julia and she stayed 
behind the entire night with no sign of Beth at all.&quot; She stated with a 
sigh. 

I pushed myself into a seated position and placed a hand to my chin as I 
tried to think about what could have happened to our friend, when I 
noticed the nurse as she checked over my chart and I remembered Beth&#39;s 
medication, &quot;Miss?&quot; I picked up my notebook and began to search for the 
name of that drug Beth had been taking.

&quot;Yes, Miss Baker?&quot; The nurse replied politely as she moved around the 
bed to come to my side, &quot;Is there anything I can do for you?&quot; 

I nodded, &quot;Do you know of a medication called...&quot; I paused as I leafed 
through the pages and finally came across the entry, &quot;Somnambulom?&quot; I 
asked. I figured it was the best lead I had to finding out what happened 
to our friend and this might be the only time I get to talk to the staff 
here. 

The nurse had a puzzled look upon her face, &quot;Somnambulom?&quot; She repeated 
the word as if it held some familiarity to it, &quot;I remember one of the 
doctors talking about it the other day.&quot; 

&quot;Which doctor?&quot; I gently probed, &quot;I am a detective, well a P.I., and 
this is of extreme importance.&quot; 

&quot;Ummm... uhhhh...&quot; The nurse seemed unsettled by my questions and 
glanced around before turning back to me, &quot;I don&#39;t know if I should be 
telling you this, but Dr. Johns has been prescribing that mediation to 
several of the patients in Ward 6.&quot; She explained in a low voice. 

&quot;Dr. Johns!!&quot; Just the sound of that man&#39;s name made my blood chill. It 
couldn&#39;t be possible, could he really be linked to Beth&#39;s disappearance? 
Was that what my dream was trying to tell me? 

&quot;Brenda? You look sick, are you going to be alright?&quot; Liz inquired 
worriedly. 

I pulled the blankets off my legs, &quot;I need to have a words with an old 
acquaintance.&quot; I grumbled as I swung my good leg off the bed. 

&quot;Wait!&quot; The nurse took hold of my arm, &quot;You can&#39;t leave here. The doctor 
still needs to check your wounds.&quot; 

I glared at the nurse, &quot;You don&#39;t understand.&quot; I pleaded with the woman, 
&quot;I have to see Dr. Johns. Someone&#39;s life could depend on it.&quot; 

Liz to tried to force me back into my bed, &quot;Are you crazy? You can&#39;t 
walk on that leg!&quot; She exclaimed uneasily, I heard her voice crack and 
felt a tear drop upon my hand. 

&quot;Liz?&quot; I stopped and placed a hand to the woman&#39;s chin, forcing her to 
look up at me. Now that I got a closer look at her I could see that she 
had spent the last while crying. She was probably trying to keep herself 
from tearing up since she entered the room, trying to be strong for me. 

&quot;I... I know you want to help Beth.&quot; She rambled through a stream of 
tears, &quot;But you need to stay put or you&#39;ll get hurt. I can&#39;t stand the 
idea of you being hurt.&quot; She cried and dropped her head into my lap. 

Hesitantly I placed a hand upon her head and ran my fingers through her 
soft hair, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I didn&#39;t mean to worry you.&quot; I said softly. I 
never realized how deeply she felt for me or how much I caused her pain. 
I felt horrible at that moment and wanted to sink into the sheets and 
hide. 

&quot;You are always being so reckless.&quot; She stated as she raised her head 
slightly, still keeping her eyes upon my lap, &quot;You always seemed to care 
more about others and never about yourself. That is what I love about 
you, but you can really drive a girl crazy at time, you know that?&quot; 

I blinked in disbelief, &quot;D... did you say you l... love me...?&quot; I 
stammered, unsure if I really wanted to hear this. All this time I&#39;d 
dreamed of Liz returning my feelings and now that I was getting it I was 
terrified. 

Liz lifted her head and looked dead in the eyes, &quot;Of course I do.&quot; She 
stated boldly, &quot;You are so sweet and lovably, how could I not love you?&quot; 
She said with a crocked smile, &quot;I&#39;ve always loved you.&quot; 

&quot;But... you...&quot; I tried to piece together what she was telling me, &quot;But 
you always pushed me away... and... What about Sarah?&quot; I inquired 
frantically. 

Liz ran her hand frantically through her hair, &quot;You were so caught up in 
your work you never seemed to notice me and I needed someone who would 
not run off to their death.&quot; She cried out. 

I was startled by what I was hearing. Here I thought she didn&#39;t love me 
because I was a foolish idiot and now I find out it is because of my 
lifestyle. My mind raced as I tried to put everything together when I 
noticed the nurse nervously standing beside me, trying not to be paying 
attention to us. I flushed as I glanced around to see several other 
patients were now watching us. We must have looked like some kind of 
drama show at that moment. Well, there goes my attempt to keep my 
sexuality a secret. I just hope this does not bite me when I return to 
work. A lesbian P.I. would not be looked upon to highly in this day and 
age. I gazed down at Liz and smiled, maybe it would be a good thing if I 
lost my job. At least I would still have Liz. That is I would have her, 
if spoke up soon and didn&#39;t let her run off on me again. 

&quot;I love you too.&quot; I said softly, not really wanting the entire room to 
hear me, &quot;I&#39;ve loved you since I first set my eyes on you behind that 
bar. I never realized that you felt the same for me. The thought makes 
me heart pound wildly in my chest. I&#39;ve always wanted to be with you. I 
just thought you didn&#39;t want to be with me.&quot; 

Liz looked up at me and a twitchy smile upon her face and wiped at her 
tears, &quot;R... really?&quot; She stammered and she rubbed the heel of her palm 
into her eye. 

I nodded my head at the girl, &quot;Really.&quot; I said simply and pulled her 
into my arms, &quot;I&#39;ll always love you.&quot; 

She sobbed into my shoulder as I held her in my arms. I could feel a 
blush cross my face as many eyes watches us, but at that moment I didn&#39;t 
really care. If someone had a problem with us I would defend my love to 
the death and I eyed a couple of the people to make sure they got the 
point. I would never allow anyone to hurt Liz. I would alway protect he, 
I just wish someone could have been there to protect her from me.
