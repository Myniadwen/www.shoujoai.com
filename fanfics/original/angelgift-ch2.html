<a href="../original/angelgift-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Both women turned to look at Allison thoughtfully. Sharin shook her 
head, her long blond hair swinging as she said to Jenna, &quot;Good luck.&quot; 
With that she shimmered a moment, then was gone, leaving a streak of 
light in her wake.

Jenna reached out to take Allison&#39;s hand in her own, and the dark 
haired woman looked her in the eyes, &quot;I will explain, I promise.&quot; She 
sighed softly, &quot;But this is not the best place. Will you come with 
me?&quot;

For a moment, Allison felt like she was drowning in those golden eyes. 
&#39;What in the world is happening to me?&#39; she thought. A breath, &quot;Sure, 
I&#39;ll come with you.&quot;

Jenna closed her eyes, light dancing around her, her long hair blowing 
backwards from a sudden uprush of air. Suddenly, white wings exploded 
from her back, reaching up to the sky through a slit cut in her white 
shirt.

Allison cried out, her shoulders burning with a sudden pain. There was 
a tearing sound, then from her own back wings matching Jenna&#39;s swept 
outward. &quot;what.. what... oh my god,&quot; Allison whispered softly.

Jenna&#39;s wings swept her up into the air, and Allison found herself 
following, her wings moving of their on will. They rose up, light as 
feathers, soon high above the office buildings of the city. &quot;We&#39;ll be 
there soon,&quot; Jenna smiled.

&#39;Thank god nobody in this city looks up,&#39; Allison thought, fighting to 
keep her terror at bay. Jenna&#39;s hand was warm in her own, and she 
tried to ignore the little lightning tingles it caused her to feel. 
&#39;Just reacting to stress,&#39; she tried to rationalize.

They descended together, both turning slowly to come down gently on 
top of a residential tower. Jenna came down first, reaching up to 
catch Allison in her arms as she landed, and with a soft cry Allison 
clung to the other woman. Jenna seemed surprised, &quot;There, there, it&#39;s 
all right,&quot; she murmured to her softly.

&quot;I&#39;ve never been so scared in my whole life,&quot; Allison blurted out. The 
brown haired young woman was shaking like a leaf, her eyes firmly 
shut.

Jenna gently led her inside, sliding the door to the penthouse shut 
behind them. She sat her down, and after a few moments Allison began 
to calm down enough to listen. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Jenna said softly, &quot;it 
seems there&#39;s much that I don&#39;t know about your people.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m scared of heights,&quot; Allison explained, shivering slightly. &quot;I 
don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been that high up before,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; Jenna murmured.

&quot;What?&quot; Allison demanded. Instead of answering Jenna walked over to 
the nearby kitchen, putting on water for tea. Allison blushed 
brightly, unwillingly noticing the sway of those hips in her tight 
black pants. A few moments later, the tea was ready, and Jenna sat 
down beside Allison on the couch.

&quot;I promised you an explanation,&quot; Jenna poured the tea. She took a 
breath, &quot;My mother, the Queen, wishes me to marry for politics. I fled 
my home to a world in the outer territories, where I encountered you.&quot;

&quot;Encountered?&quot; Allison echoed, &quot;You totaled my house!&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Jenna admitted. &quot;You see, my ship was destroyed on 
arrival, and my descent to your world was uncontrolled,&quot; she 
explained.

&quot;So you crashed into my house, destroying it,&quot; Allison said. She 
blushed suddenly, remembering, &quot;And something else happened, too.&quot;

Jenna blushed as well. &quot;Yes,&quot; she admitted softly. &quot;I found you in the 
rubble. My arrival had hurt you terribly, done you fatal harm.&quot; She 
took a deep breath, &quot;There was only one way I could replenish you life 
force and save you.&quot;

Jenna trailed off, and Allison prompted her, &quot;How?&quot;

&quot;The bonding,&quot; Jenna blushed harder. &quot;Among my people when two choose 
to become lifemates, they share their life forces in the bonding. 
That&#39;s what the first kiss was,&quot; she explained.

&quot;Lifemates,&quot; Allison echoed, her eyes wide, &quot;you mean it&#39;s for life?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Jenna nodded. She looked up at Allison shyly as she asked her 
softly, &quot;Would that be so bad?&quot;

Allison blushed fiercely, &quot;Well, no.&quot; She tilted her head to the side, 
&quot;You said the first kiss was for the bonding. What about the second 
one?&quot;

Jenna smiled widely, &quot;Because I liked the first one, of course.&quot;

Allison blushed fiercely.

In another part of town, a frowning Sharin strode down the street. She 
had stripped her uniform of it&#39;s exterior armor, leaving her sheathed 
in tight black leather. Her long blond hair swirled around her as she 
scanned the crowds.

&quot;What a dump,&quot; Sharin muttered. The technology level of this place was 
just pitiful, barely in the atomics era! Why Jenna would pick a place 
like this was totally beyond her.

&quot;New blood,&quot; she heard from behind her.

&quot;Fair game,&quot; another answered, and she could hear several figures 
moving.

Sharin walked on, turning into the dead end alley, pausing long enough 
to give them a chance to gather. She turned, looking surprised at the 
six young men and women behind her. &quot;Something I can do for you?&quot; she 
asked pleasantly.

&quot;Give us all your money,&quot; the dark haired man asked with a grin.

&quot;And if I don&#39;t?&quot; Sharin asked.

&quot;You&#39;ll pay the price,&quot; his buddy said ominously.

&quot;No, you will,&quot; Sharin grinned, and ran at them.

A few moments later unconscious young men where scattered around the 
alley. A pink haired woman tried to slip away, but Sharin collared her 
smoothly.

&quot;Can&#39;t even get a good fight here,&quot; Sharin complained bitterly. She 
scowled down at the pink haired woman, &quot;And what is a Rhian warrioress 
doing slumming down here?&quot;

&quot;Running from the Empire, what do you think,&quot; the girl growled.

An odd look crossed Sharin&#39;s face, &quot;And how many like you are on this 
planet?&quot;

The pink haired girl pulled free and began dusting herself off, &quot;A 
fair number.&quot;

&#39;The Queen is not going to like this,&quot; Sharin thought, even as the 
girl fled down the alley. &#39;And she is going to find out eventually,&#39; 
she thought grimly.
