<p>“Corpse World: the morbid, the  merrier!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Disgusting.” Allegra shivered  just by glancing at the monitor. Kayleigh and Teleah were usually  sound of mind, despite their stark personalities, but this time she  seriously had to question their judgment. There was no reason for any  creature to visit the nameless necropolis, city of the dead—or for  that matter, there was not even a reason to go <em>near</em> it. True  to its name, it was a moon-sized world completely covered with  corpses, regarded as the universe’s graveyard, with rotting flesh  for soil, blood for rivers and oceans, and bones for mountains. It  was impossible for anything to live there: not only because nothing  grew there, but the atmosphere was fatal to breathe; the air was  saturated with the stench of death, and even a fly would suffocate in  agony. A desperate smuggler facing half a military armada would  sooner turn and fight rather than land there; the most  battle-hardened warriors turned sick and pale just by mentioning it.  Every galactic brochure describing ideal tourist destinations had  only three words for this vision from Hell:</p>
<p>DON’T GO THERE.</p>
<p>So why was the <em>Dauntless</em> hovering overhead, threatening to descend? Certainly not out of  morbid curiosity. Something was buried beneath the festering earth,  an ancient artifact of enormous power: a material that, oddly enough,  drew Sharyn and Kyrie together to form an unusual alliance. Out of  the many quests the Lady of New Avalon had been sent on, she had been  asked to retrieve at least one of the mystical Blessings, objects  that could bring great prosperity—or ruin—to those who possessed  them. The Standard of Andvari had been one of the three Blessings,  and now Sharyn had asked the Acheron twins—<em>begged</em> them,  really—to guide her to the second. Because there were so many risks  involved, Sharyn was warned that nobody else would follow her on such  a horrifying journey, and accepted the responsibility. But she had  very strong friends.</p>
<p>Amazingly, Kyrie had been the first  to volunteer. “I never knew fear until I learned that this place  existed,” she whispered timidly, “but if you’re after what I  think you’re after, then I’m coming along. It’s the Breath of  Vulcan, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Aye, but how didst—“</p>
<p>“I know about it? Please, I’m  not just a pretty face and a charming genius! Your Kyrie has done  some research! The Breath of Vulcan can turn winter into spring,  spark fire in the most obstinate hearth, ignite any forge, and can  invigorate a strong fighting spirit, or so I’ve read. It could very  well be just a legend, but there’s a grain of truth behind every  story, and every Red worth his or her salt has been searching for  Vulcan’s Breath. But why the hell would it be <em>here?</em>”</p>
<p>“I knoweth not,” Sharyn stated  as she girded herself for the journey. She would have to forego her  armor and sword in favor of another form of protection, a spacesuit.  Her lean, strong body, fit and firm from years of hard work and  dedication, easily slipped into the suit, and Kyrie was small enough  to glide in as well, even with her wings. But they were not the only  ones going </p>
<p>along: Alala decided to go out as  well and test her courage, and it was universally believed that  wherever Alala went, Yenae was not far behind.</p>
<p>“Somebody has to take care of  you,” she cooed. Alala glared, but she <em>was</em> grateful: she  didn’t believe she could face the necropolis by herself. And she <em>was</em> warming up to Yenae, slowly but surely; she just needed  more time to judge the rogue’s sincerity. Lyara decided to come  along as well, though her reasons were more emotional. She needed to  get away from Rebecca and Riene, since memories of their time spent  together on that empty world still lingered in her heart, and she  also knew that she wanted to stay by Sharyn’s side and observe her  courage for herself as she dove into this foreboding environment. The  green-skinned lady had gradually become a source of comfort and  strength for Lyara; just being around her calmed the Valar’s  cluttered thoughts. She was a pure, clear river flowing away from a  storm.</p>
<p>There were two last-minute additions  to the team, Allegra and Kate, and their reasons for going were even  more introspective. Although Allegra refused to tell anyone else why  she wanted to visit such a dead world, she did let Kate in on the  secret, and because she trusted her so much, Kate opened her own  final barrier and made herself vulnerable. The two did not speak as  they put their spacesuits on (Kate’s was a bit of a squeeze), but  their faces were clear and focused, expressions that had not been a  part of their world for ages. They had bared their souls and drew  closer because of it, and they shared a smile as the <em>Dauntless’s</em> passenger shuttle flew down and came to rest upon the drear, rank  surface.</p>
<p>“Here we go,” Sharyn announced,  trying to keep hold of her bravery. Lyara marched next to her and  clasped her hand, smiling through her visor. That humble gesture gave  Sharyn the additional strength she needed to take the first step.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Hearing or reading about the world  of corpses, and walking upon its surface, are two alarmingly  different concepts; it’s like reading about Hell, and then going  there. There was no wind blowing, for one, so except for the crunch  of boots and the hiss of breathing, the world was completely silent.  Nothing lived or grew there, not even grasses, lichen, or fungus, and  the surface was covered with rotting flesh and shredded skin. A  thick, gooey red river gurgled in the distance, made completely out  of blood that seeped out of the piles of bodies, and instead of  trees, mountains, or roads, bones had been forged together to create  a ghastly landscape. It was enough to snap the mind and drive a  person insane, and were it not for the company of others, nobody  would have gotten far.</p>
<p>“So, uh, how’s everyone holding  up?” Kyrie whispered shakily.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“As well as can be expected,”  Sharyn answered, her voice wrought with intensity. She was glad that  Lyara was next to her; she felt naked without her sword. “Let us  not waste breath on idle chatter. Our supplies shan’t last long.”</p>
<p>“So it’s get in, find what we’re  looking for, and get out?” Sharyn tapped her helmet, a gesture for  “you got it”, and knelt down so she could get a firmer grasp of  the land: they had approached a hill and would have to climb over it.  The suits were too heavy to perform acrobatics in, so they all had to  tread carefully, and devote every moment to caution and precision. An  observer would liken their movements to a ballet: seven bulky aliens  trudging around clumsily in search of something they hoped would be  worth their efforts. Although Kyrie and Sharyn assured everyone that  the Breath of Vulcan was certainly worth the risk, the others were  not interested in the treasure: they had all come to test themselves.</p>
<p><em>I sure am glad we have to save  our air,</em> Alala exclaimed to herself. <em>That means that  irritating she-devil won’t be able to tease me! No name-calling, no  singing, no flirting…and for that matter, with this suit on, she  can’t pull my tail or touch my ears! This is great! Well worth the  horrors I have to put up with!</em></p>
<p>“What are you so happy about,  snookie wookums?” Yenae sang. All of Alala’s hopes burst like a  bubble thrust against a thorn.</p>
<p>“Hey, didn’t sharyn tell us not  to waste our air? Don’t talk to me unless you have to!”</p>
<p>“But you’re wasting air, too,”  she giggled. Alala growled at her cheekiness, but decided she was too  dignified to sink that low, and this was no place to goof around.</p>
<p>“Why did you come, anyway? You’ve  got no reason to be here.”</p>
<p>“Neither do you, pumpkin.”</p>
<p>“URGH! This is a personal quest,  you immature brat! I’m testing myself to see how far I’ve come.”</p>
<p>“That’s so admirable!” she  squealed, tackling Alala with a hug. Being slammed by a spacesuit in  normal gravity is not a fun experience. Alala fell over with a crash,  Yenae piled on top, squealing happily.</p>
<p>“H-hey, gedoffa me! Quit fooling  around! We’re dragging everybody else behind and we’re wasting  our air!!”</p>
<p>“Well, if you run out, darling, I  can just give you CPR.”</p>
<p>“Oh, shut up! Help me pull this  twisted monster off, will ya!” Lyara wanted to roll her eyes and  scold them for making such a scene, but the planet was so grim and  scary that a bit of comic relief was refreshing. It was worth losing  a bit of time, energy, and air to lift everyone’s spirits.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“All right, we’re coming,” she  chuckled. Hearing the serious-minded elf laughing did even greater  wonders, and soon everyone was relaxed and their joy was restored.  The “lovebirds” were pulled free and the journey continued,  Sharyn and Kyrie in the lead. As everyone took a rest at the top of  the bone hill, Yenae caught up with Alala and tapped her on the  shoulder. The catgirl shooed her away, but Yenae was persistent, and  finally got her attention.</p>
<p>“What now?”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to answer your  question. You asked why I came along, remember?”</p>
<p>“Yes, so?” Yenae smiled warmly  and embraced Alala’s left arm.</p>
<p>“I came because you were coming  along.”</p>
<p>“Oh, please!”</p>
<p>“No, really. I wanted to be with  my sweetie pie. I wanted to stay by your side.” Alala couldn’t  see Yenae’s face, but it was glowing and warm with love. Her voice  reflected this much, though, and the warmth crept into Alala’s  body, sneaking up to her face and causing her to blush. It was true  that not even the insane would visit this world, not unless they had  to, and anyone accompanying them would probably only do so because  they wanted to. Alala could feel it in her gentle grasp and her warm  voice: Yenae wanted to be with her even as she walked through a  literal valley of death. None of her previous love interests could  claim that.</p>
<p>Reaching the top of the bone-hill  was only the beginning of their troubles: they had to go down, too,  and the surface was far from stable. One wrong slip would cause an  avalanche, and there was also a pool of blood not far away from the  bottom, increasing the risk. Alala volunteered to go first, and with  the elegant nimbleness of her kin, she shimmied down and encouraged  her friends to follow.</p>
<p>“We’re not Felinis, y’know,”  Allegra muttered.</p>
<p>“Or spiders, for that matter,”  Kate added. Their descent was far less graceful; Allegra tripped and  fell, causing half the hill to collapse, and their companions with  it. Thankfully, their bulky suits served to protect them from the  fall and the landslide, and they missed the pool. Lyara, Sharyn, and  Yenae escaped with relative ease, so they helped dig their  unfortunate friends out.</p>
<p>“Talk about getting a boner,”  Kyrie snickered as she was pulled free. Yenae snickered; Sharyn, in  her innocence, didn’t quite understand the humor. She jerked to the  side and shrieked as another figure joined them, sneaking up out of  nowhere.</p>
<p>“Need a hand?”</p>
<p>“YAAAH!! Halt, fiend!” She went  for her sword-belt out of habit, but only drew out an imaginary  weapon. Even Lyara had been caught off guard, but she had been  preoccupied with </p>
<p>unearthing the others. The stranger  waved their hands in a gesture of peace and tried not to laugh too  much.</p>
<p>“Forgive me for sneaking up on  you. I heard a crash and came over here to check it out. It’s been  awhile, hasn’t it?” Her voice sounded familiar, but peering into  her face was difficult with the visor. Alala, however, screamed with  ecstasy, and rammed into a stranger like a puppy welcoming her master  home.</p>
<p>“Lady Rosemont! Is that really  you? Ohmygod, what are you <em>doing</em> here?!”</p>
<p>“Ow, take it easy! It’s been a  long time since I’ve been greeted with such enthusiasm. Help me up,  will you, and tell me how you’ve been since we last saw each other.  I’m assuming Valti took care of that tentacle beast?”</p>
<p>It was Marsa Rosemont, former High  Priestess of Tigris, the woman who had performed the marriage  ceremony for Alala’s mother and stepmother, and who had lifted the  curse of Rajani.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“You’ve been very busy,” Marsa  remarked softly as they finished their tale. Running into the Dead  Roses, participating in the Space Race, getting stranded on a  deserted world…it sounded like the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> had  been destined for adventure. “I’m glad to hear everyone’s all  right. Your concerns about the Doppelganger are well-placed: they’re  a mysterious race that usually doesn’t get involved with outsiders.  I’m surprised you even met one. Whatever she was doing, it was  probably a portent of greater troubles. As for the name of Origin,  I’m afraid I don’t know much, although I promise I’ll look into  it. I’m actually doing some research right now, if you’d care to  join me.”</p>
<p>“That would be awesome!” Alala  squealed, once again forgetting to conserve her air. Sharyn sighed  and put her hand on the catgirl’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“We can afford very little time,  most holy lady. We are on a quest to retrieve Vulcan’s Breath.  Perhaps thou hast heard of it?”</p>
<p>“Of course I have, it’s one of  the three Blessings. Ah, so that’s the kind of trial they’re  putting young squires through on New Avalon, is it?”</p>
<p>“Nay, tis’ a personal journey.”</p>
<p>“I see. Well, maybe we can help  each other out anyway. I discovered what might be the Breath’s  resting place, but since I wasn’t interested in it, I didn’t  bother investigating. I would hate to </p>
<p>impose, but if you could just offer  me a little assistance, I would gladly help you find what you’re  looking for.”</p>
<p>“Tis’ a fair bargain,” Sharyn  replied as she and Marsa shook hands (she wanted to kneel, but Marsa  forbade it). Kyrie didn’t like the idea of slowing down, regardless  of the reason or who she had to help, and claimed to have an even  better idea.</p>
<p>“Sharyn and I are the only ones  that want it, Miss R! You can just keep the others and lead us there!  We’ll be fine on our own.”</p>
<p>“That sounds good,” Kate said.  “That would actually save us more time, and we can meet up once  everything is taken care of.” Marsa shook her head doubtfully.</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous here with small  groups. Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll be going  with them.” Lyara gave Marsa an assuring smile, and locked eyes  with Sharyn. “I promise I’ll protect you.”</p>
<p>“Lyara…” She couldn’t see  it, but the warrior’s face was glowing red. Lyara felt the love and  admiration flowing out of Sharyn’s heart and turned away before she  was overwhelmed. Marsa led half of the team to her research site, and  told them to wait while she guided the other half to the altar of  Vulcan. While Yenae snuggled up with Alala and lovingly pestered her,  Kate and Allegra shared a quieter moment together, staring at each  other fondly as they waited for the priestess to return. They had  remained silent for most of the trip, not just because they wanted to  conserve their air, but they were also girding their souls for the  battle to come.</p>
<p>This was not merely a world of  corpses. This was a place where ghosts came to life.</p>
<p>“I envy those two,” Allegra  whispered, nudging her friend. Alala and Yenae were wrestling and  shrieking in spite of their surroundings, their outfits, and their  air. They were completely oblivious to everything except each other.</p>
<p>“Yeah, me too,” Kate replied,  folding her hands as she sat on one of Marsa’s chairs. “I’ve  never had anyone like that, Allegra. I mean, with Sarishaun, I could  at least feel what love was like, and when I was with those Amazons,  I felt like somebody really wanted to be with me. But I’ve never  been with anybody that stuck by my side—nobody except you, that is.  Tell me, Allegra, is it really better to love, and lose, than never  to love at all?” The gunslinger moaned softly, drawing her knees  close to her chest.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I doubt it, Katie.  Steven and I had such a brief affair…and when I couldn’t even  take care of my young’uns anymore, I just lost it. I stopped  believin’ in love a long time ago. Instead, I just carried around…”  Something caught Allegra’s eye and stole her breath away. Alala and  Yenae stopped goofing around, and Kate inched closer, taking hold of  Allegra’s gloved hand. A misty, luminescent entity rose from the  desecrated ground and took shape, gazing directly at Alala. Another  form, a smaller one, stood out of the haze to greet Shepherd, and  just as Allegra predicted, several dozen figures passed through the  deadly fog to surround </p>
<p>her. This is what she and Kate came  here for, not for treasure or tests, but to finally confront their  personal ghosts.</p>
<p>“These are all the people I killed  when I lost my mind,” Allegra moaned. She struggled to stand and  face them; her voice and knees were wobbly. “And all the people I  killed after that, too. So many came after me…so many.”</p>
<p>“And this is the girl I killed  when I raided that man’s hideout,” Kate whispered. The young lady  looked up at her, neither angry nor sad, just silent and motionless.  Alala was screaming feverishly, covering her ears so she wouldn’t  be deafened by her own shouts.</p>
<p>“M…mother? Mother, is that you?  What are you doing here? You can’t be here! Mama said that you went  to a good place when you died! Why are you here?! Don’t tell me  you…NO, THAT CAN’T BE!! YOU DON’T BELONG HERE!! WHAT THE HELL  ARE YOU? MY MOTHER WENT TO HEAVEN! SHE CAN’T BE…here…”</p>
<p>Alala sobbed and knelt on the  ground, prostrating herself in sorrow. The ghostly figure approached  her, and though it did not reach out to her, Alala felt herself being  lifted up. She saw the entity’s lips loving—lips she still  remembered kissing her when she was so young—and although no sound  came forth, Alala seemed to understand her. She wept once more, but  out of happiness and not frustration.</p>
<p>“I see, so that’s how it is. I’m  sorry I got so upset. How could I doubt her? I’m so happy…” She  inched closer and, even though this image was not her mother, she  snuggled next to it anyway, purring softly. Yenae watched her out of  the corner of her eye, her heart overflowing with love. She was also  confronting her own ghosts, but with Alala there by her side, there  was nothing she could not overcome. She dismissed them peacefully and  felt an enormous burden lift her shoulders.</p>
<p>Kate and Allegra were still holding  hands, even though they had individual battles to wage. The images in  front of them represented the people they had killed, whether  accidentally or by insane design, and they needed to conquer these  ghosts and release them if they had any hope of returning to a normal  life. Kate went first, and knelt down on the mushy surface, slipping  out of Allegra’s grasp.</p>
<p>“Can you ever forgive me for  stealing your life so soon?” she said to the entity. The girl said  nothing; she just kept her big, empty eyes focused on her killer.  Kate smiled sadly and said, “Or are you thankful I took you away  from all of life’s hardships? Go ahead and say it, then: I’m a  coward who just ran away. I never wanted to confront this problem  again. I shut my ears and closed my eyes, and for what it’s worth,  I’ve hated myself for it ever since. Please, tell me: how can I  come to terms with what I’ve done?” The ghostly girl was still  silent, but now she smiled, and reached out to touch Kate’s visor.  The gesture was so gentle and loving that Kate interpreted it as a  sign of forgiveness, her permission to release all the guilt and  self-loathing she had carried around for so long. Kate wept and  smiled shakily. The best way for her to move on, then, would be to  simply move on, forgive herself, and devote the rest of her life to  goodness, so her one horrible mistake would be her last.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Allegra?” she called, turning  to face her source of joy and inspiration. She saw her friend keening  on the ground, an invisible demon clinging to her back, and rushed to  help. Yenae swooped in clumsily and held her back, shaking her large,  domed helmet.</p>
<p>“No, let her face them alone.  She’ll never break free if she can’t do it by her own power.”</p>
<p>“I know, but can’t I at least  stand by her side?” Yenae’s face drooped, and for awhile she  revealed the part of her that was most hidden: the vulnerable, soft,  sensitive Yenae that listened to her heart regardless of the  consequences. Alala got a brief glimpse of this face, and was  stunned.</p>
<p>“Allegra,” Marliir said, her  voice soothing. “Did you see my ghosts? I had more than you do.  Although I’ve rarely killed someone directly, I’ve been  responsible for the loss of so many lives. Many of them were my  enemies, true, but they still died thanks to my actions. I can’t  give you any easy answers, Allegra: I had to come up with a way to  defeat them all on my own. Right now I have an angel at my side, with  an iron will and an invincible heart; I can free myself and be at  peace. Find your own contentment Allegra, whatever it may be. We must  grab onto this if we’re to console our pasts and prepare our  futures.” She turned to face the woman she loved, waved, and  shuffled off to join her; Alala was still stricken by what she saw  and heard, and did not reject her company. Kate knelt down next to  the tormented woman, refraining from touching her, and waited for her  to overcome her nightmares.</p>
<p>She decided to start singing.</p>
<p><em>Even though people are there,</em></p>
<p><em>People are here as well.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to connect all of the  small miracles;</em></p>
<p><em>The door to tomorrow will be  opened.</em></p>
<p><em>Sha lala, lala,</em></p>
<p><em>This planet is gentle, so</em></p>
<p><em>Let my exhausted body be  released.</em></p>
<p><em>Time is the history</em></p>
<p><em>On the morning of shooting stars</em></p>
<p><em>By being wrapped in the wind.</em></p>
<p>Allegra had stopped keening, and was  now crouching on the ground, a solemn figure meditating amidst a  world of death. Long minutes of personal introspection passed before  she slowly rose </p>
<p>up, brushed the filth from her suit,  and turned to face her friends. Allegra lifted her arm, extended it,  and gave them a thumbs-up, smiling sweetly.</p>
<p>“I ain’t afraid of no ghosts.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Kyrie said as  she gazed out at the great reddish-black ocean of blood, standing  between a skeletal pier and the altar they sought. Marsa had brought  them this far, telling them as much about the world as she knew, but  then they ran into this obstacle, a stinking, bubbling pit that  stretched out all the way to the horizon. Marsa touched the sky with  her finger, indicating the shore where she had spotted the Breath of  Vulcan.</p>
<p>“I made a boat,” she said,  leading them down a gentle bluff to the shoreline. Sharyn felt like  she was visiting the first ring of the seventh circle of Hell, where  the damned were boiled in blood according to their foul deeds: the  wickeder the sin, the further they were submerged. Like Virgil, Marsa  guided them through the hellish inferno to a boat just large enough  to hold three people, Charon’s own personal ferry.</p>
<p>“Use those as paddles,” she  said, pointing to two large leg bones. “Head southeast from here  and you’ll find the island of Vulcan. That’s what I called it,  anyway. Since I didn’t investigate, I have no idea what’s waiting  for you, but best of luck. I have to head back to my research, so I  hope you can find your way back. <em>Vian con Dios.</em>” Sharyn  wasted no time and stepped into the boat, assisting her friends  inside. They each grabbed a makeshift oar, trying not to let their  disgust overwhelm them, and paddled down the murky ocean to their  destination. Their air supply was getting low, so they refrained from  speaking.</p>
<p>The atrocity of the Blood Ocean had  clouded their vision, for the island was much nearer than they  believed, or else the current was better than expected. In any case,  they made anchor and faced the structure that crowned the island, a  single large skull that had belonged to a three-eyed beast. The  creature must have been enormous in life, for its nasal cavities  could’ve held all three women very comfortably, and the cavernous  mouth was almost large enough for the <em>Dauntless</em> to fly  through. They were not comfortable walking into that toothy maw, but  compared to the rest of the world, it seemed downright homey. Even  so, Lyara wedged several bones into the jaw and stood guard while  Sharyn and Kyrie pressed on.</p>
<p>Finding the Breath of Vulcan, an  unmistakable sculpture rent from pure fire-crystals and formed into  the shape of a cloud, seemed offensively anticlimactic after  everything they had been put through. Kyrie in particular was  expecting to find monsters, traps, or at least a labyrinth to work  through, but here it was, barely fifteen meters inside the mouth,  waiting for a new master! She picked it up pitiably, shrugged, and  handed it to Sharyn, who was a little more thankful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Urgh, is that all there is? Seems  kind of a letdown.”</p>
<p>“Let us not curse good fortune,  friend. The horrors outside were tribulation enough.”</p>
<p>“Good point,” she shivered. The  necropolis seemed to increase in depravity once they emerged from the  skull, and a flashing light in their suits indicated there was going  to be further trouble. They were running out of air. Wanting to  conserve as much as possible, Sharyn pointed to the boat, and they  paddled her back to the pier as carefully as they could, not wanting  to overexert themselves. Everything became difficult now that their  air supply was dwindling. What was once a relatively simple task—  walking, climbing, even moving the arms—  now became tiresome and heavy. Lyara started to yawn, and Kyrie began  gasping irregularly, trying to draw what little oxygen was left. They  had worked too hard and had spoken too much, and would soon regret  this short-sighted idiocy. The Breath of Vulcan felt cold and useless  in their hands, but Sharyn pressed on, even as her muscles sagged and  her vision blurred. She…<em>had</em>…promised to give one of the  Blessings to her people, and with the Standard gone…</p>
<p>“Not yet,” she heard Lyara say,  as she was lifted up by strong Elvish arms. She pulled Sharyn’s  helmet towards hers and, though they were separated by their visors,  the two women could easily see each other’s faces, and feel  connected somehow in this wasteland. “You’re not giving up yet.  Marsa said she was researching. She has to have more supplies. We  just have to make it back. You can do this, Sharyn of New Avalon. I  believe in you. Don’t let that trust go to waste, now.”</p>
<p>She smiled feebly and nodded. Kyrie  was still standing, at least, but what sanity she had left was  slipping away with every molecule of air sucked out. She sang,  twirled dizzily, laughed softly, clapped to an inaudible tune, and  babbled out nonsense. Lyara couldn’t even gather up enough strength  to sigh, so she just pushed the Pyrosian in the right direction,  hoping she wouldn’t be permanently damaged. She noticed Sharyn  holding up well, and reached out to sense her emotions. They were  pale and faded, just as she expected, but they fought to maintain  their firmness, and most of them were focused on two ideals:</p>
<p>Love of country.</p>
<p>And love of Lyara. The elf blushed.</p>
<p>“Shut up,” she grunted, giving  Kyrie a blunt kick. The Pyrosian did as she was told, strangely, and  became still and limp. Lyara feared the worst, but she couldn’t  stop yet: she had promised to protect them both. She <em>did</em> love  Sharyn, or at least she cared about her, and as obnoxious and  eccentric as Kyrie was, she didn’t deserve to be left behind in  this deathly world. Lyara felt blind as she groped ahead, and her  fingers turned prickly. She sent a telepathic message to Marsa,  squeezing out almost all her energy, and gave way underneath the  staggering weight of asphyxiation. The last thing she saw before her  world went dark was her helmet being thrust off, and a beautiful  green-skinned goddess leaning in to kiss her.</p>
<p>“You fool,” she murmured, “this  is no time for romance…”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>An hour after parting ways with  Marsa and returning to the <em>Dauntless</em>, Yenae wanted nothing  more than to take a shower. Even though no part of her body had  physically touched that damned world, she still wanted to scour  herself long and hard. There was nobody in the public showers, so she  undressed, skipped right in, turned one of the spigots to full blast,  and let out a loud, happy groan as scalding hot water washed the  filth away. After a few seconds, she cooled it down and took her time  cleaning, but wished she had some company. While she was shampooing  her silky blonde hair, the washroom door opened and her wish was  granted, beyond all measure of hope and fantasy. Alala strolled  inside, humming merrily to herself, and started to undress as she  picked out a stall. Yenae felt her heart soaring; she was in heaven.</p>
<p>“Yoo-hoo, pretty kitty! Over  here!!” Alala yelped in surprise, and comically covered her skinny  body with a towel.</p>
<p>“Aw, no freaking way! Are you <em>following</em> me or something? What did I do to deserve <em>this?!</em>”</p>
<p>“Oh, quit whining and come join  me!” Yenae sang. Alala growled, but seeing as how she was in a  relatively good mood…and she did sort of want someone to talk  to…and she did sort of like all the attention, as aggravating as it  was…and her inner pervert did want to see what Yenae looked like  without any clothes…</p>
<p><em>Get it together! This is the  wickedest and most lecherous woman in the universe we’re talking  about! She’ll probably just sneak into your stall and try to seduce  you! You can’t trust her! Take a shower in your room!</em></p>
<p><em>But would it really be so bad?</em></p>
<p>“You’re just lucky I’m feeling  so good!” she snapped as she removed her clothes and chose the  stall next to Yenae’s. And bless her, poor girl, she couldn’t  help but sneak a peak at the bronze-skinned woman’s back…and her  backside. As she turned the water on, Yenae’s smooth slender tail  slithered out and touched Alala’s silky furry tail. The catgirl  stiffened for a moment as the two appendages intertwined, but then  relaxed, thinking back to that day when they were stranded together,  and had drawn closer. Their tails had embraced back then, too; it was  a fond memory and it made her feel at ease.</p>
<p>“So is it really true you killed  all those people?” she whispered solemnly. Yenae pointed her nose  to the ceiling and raised her hand defensively.</p>
<p>“I have absolutely no idea what  you’re talking about! Those ghosts of mine are dead and gone. I  only have you in my life, sweet kitten. The rest is a forgotten  memory buried long ago and far away.” Alala’s blush strengthened,  and her smile became even more timid. Sometimes, Yenae could be  poetic and deep.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“If that’s the case, then I’m  glad. You know, I never really knew my birth-mother. Mama kept  pictures, of course, but I never saw her when she was alive. Somehow,  I remember her kissing me when I was still just a kitten…but maybe  those are just thoughts I’ve made myself. Do you think she’d be  proud of me, Yenae?”</p>
<p>“I don’t even know why you’re  asking that question,” she sighed, sprawling out on the partition,  hair and arms drooping lazily. “You shouldn’t have any doubts  after today’s fiasco, Lala. Anyone who thinks less of you should  have their head stuck in a toilet. Your mother and stepmother love  you so much, you know…and so do I. Did I tell you I was hopelessly  and madly in love with you yet, my delicious lemon cupcake, because  if I haven’t, I’m telling you right now!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’ve told me,” she  grunted, feeling exasperated. She pried her eyes open, saw the  beautiful warmth of Yenae’s glow, blushed, and turned her back.  “Listen,” she whispered, “I want…to thank you for going down  there with me. It really meant a lot. Yenae…I <em>want</em> to like  you, but…I’m sorry, I still have doubts. It’s harder because  I’ve had my heart broken.”</p>
<p>“I guess that means I’ll have to  work hard to prove myself,” she answered sweetly. Alala turned  halfway, gave Yenae a genuine smile, and shut the water off.</p>
<p>“That’s it for me. Unlike  certain people, I am <em>not</em> a dirty girl, so I don’t need to  spend hours cleaning myself!”</p>
<p>“And I suppose this dispels  another myth about your people,” Yenae tittered. Alala tilted her  head to one side, looking horrifyingly cute. It took everything Yenae  had to restrain herself. “It seems you <em>don’t</em> use your  tongues to bathe…although I wouldn’t mind using mine.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, lech!” Alala snapped her  towel up and marched off, but Yenae was able to have a brief glimpse  of her bare bottom before it wiggled away. She blew a kiss, turned  her water off, and grabbed a towel, wondering if it would be wise to  follow her felonious pal.</p>
<p>“Some other time,” she cooed,  rubbing the cloth over her bronze skin. “I don’t want to push the  dear girl away. We made a lot of progress today.” Images of Alala’s  beautiful bottom appeared in her mind, and there they would stay  forever and always. “Definitely a lot of progress!” she giggled.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Well, Kyrie seems to be taking  this in stride. It might be awhile before she snaps out of it,  though.”</p>
<p>“Aye, she didn’t move even when  we presented that lighter. Truly in a daze.”</p>
<p>Lyara smiled to herself, and to  Sharyn, as that last thought hovered in the silent air. A daze… The  two of them had acted like they were also in a daze as the shuttle  returned to the <em>Dauntless</em> and they resumed their lives. As  usual, they didn’t speak very much when they took a bath </p>
<p>together, but the silence was no  longer awkward or troublesome, and they even seemed to enjoy it.  Kyrie was still a little ballistic when they came back, but she had  calmed down now and was resting in her room, clutching the lighter  they had given her. Fuuka promised she would examine her later, but  she gave them a promising early diagnostic. Apparently, the lack of  oxygen combined with the warped terrain had dealt very little  cerebral damage; it was what happened later that ultimately caused  her mental breakdown.</p>
<p>Once the finished with their bath,  and safely put Kyrie in her room, Lyara and Sharyn took a walk around  the ship together, leisurely exploring its wondrous terrain—  sometimes holding hands, sometimes refraining. It was difficult to  bring up the subject of what had happened recently, but they knew  they must address it, and soon. They were too close now to avoid  meaningless secrets like that. As the more experienced person, Lyara  felt it was her duty to speak first, but Sharyn’s chivalrous honor  prompted her first.</p>
<p>“I want to thank thee for thine  accompaniment. I could not accomplish this task alone.”</p>
<p>“I was glad to help,” Lyara  whispered, not daring to speak any louder, at the risk of ruining  such delicacy. “While we’re at it, I want to thank you for saving  my life. Are you sure <em>you’re</em> okay?”</p>
<p>“Aye, I did not inhale any of the  fumes. I…am a bit repentant about the method I used…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” she grinned,  noticing Sharyn’s sweet, shy face. “I’m just glad you had some  oxygen to spare…and that Lady Rosemont came back to us in time.  Thank goodness <em>she</em> was there.”</p>
<p>“Aye, a serendipitous adventure.”  Once again, the two ladies were silent. Lyara reached for Sharyn’s  strong hand and held it protectively. Their fingers wrapped together  tightly, and both women smiled forlornly.</p>
<p>“It’s too bad Vulcan’s Breath  evaporated when we took it away from that world. Who would have  thought that the stench of death was keeping it alive? What pitiful  irony. Um, Sharyn, you know that if there’s anything I can do to  help you find the third Blessing…”</p>
<p>“Say not such sweet words,  dearest,” she warbled, slowly kneeling as she brought Lyara’s  hand to her lips. She kissed it, and wept softly. “That you risked  thine own life for my selfish cause was treasure in itself. To have  someone I care for stand by me and raise my dejected spirits…”  Lyara’s hands were fluid as they covered Sharyn’s lips, brought  her face close, and held it gently as she kissed her mouth for the  first time, gloriously and deeply. There was no shock or awe between  them while it lasted, only a sense of wonderful finality. Lyara’s  face was enraptured when they parted.</p>
<p>“It’s official now,” she  grinned. Sharyn’s skin almost turned totally red.</p>
<p>“Ah…aye, I suppose it is! But  should that not be enough…”</p>
<p>And so, their walk was delayed a  little more.</p>
<p></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Are you feeling better?”  Allegra asked as she dried her hair. Kate’s eyes closed, she was  smiling so much.</p>
<p>“Yes! That shower really did the  trick! Ugh, I’m ready to visit a beautiful world now! Um…so what  about you? Are you any better?”</p>
<p>“Lots!” Allegra heaved as she  threw her hair back. It sparkled like moonlight, pure golden-white  with flecks of water still flying as she sighed—  a beautiful sight for Kate after suffering through a place even worse  than her Utopia. Her pulse quickened, and she began gathering her  courage. Today would be the day she told Allegra about her feelings—  yes, today would be the day. In just a few hours…</p>
<p>“A million times better,”  Allegra clarified, slinging the towel over her shoulder. Her emerald  eyes glistened, and her face seemed innocent and pure for the first  time. “That weight I was carryin’ around just rolled right off.  You know, it wasn’t just my own gumption that got me through that.  Y’all really came through for me. Where’d you learn that song,  anyway?”</p>
<p>“From…a friend,” Kate  murmured. She didn’t dare say that her first lover had sang it to  her during the aftermath of their sex. “It always helped bring me  out of my dark moments. I figured it could do the same for you.”</p>
<p>“That it did, Katie.” Allegra  nestled closer to her strong, gentle friend, burying her shoulders in  Kate’s chest as she folded her arms around her waist. This was  everything Kate had been wishing for and more, and the woman she  cherished had been the one to start it! If ever there was a time to  open that final barrier and expose her feelings for what they were…  “You know,” Allegra whispered sweetly, “you’re the best  friend I’ve ever had. I dunno what I’d do without ya.”</p>
<p>“I feel the same way,” she  cooed. Then, leaning closer so she could whisper gently, “I’m in  love with you, Allegra.” She was able to kiss her ear softly before  van Landingham broke away from her embrace. A look of fear, doubt,  confusion, and amazement was on her pale face, and yet, for a very  long time, Allegra had suspected…</p>
<p>“I thought so,” she sighed. “Oh,  Katie, I don’t know how to answer that. It’s just…not something  a lady would do…”</p>
<p>“So what does that make me, then?”  she cut. Kathleen Shepherd reared back like an angry tigress, her  eyes ablaze with hurt and offense. She honestly didn’t expect  Allegra to just throw open her arms and smother her with kisses, nor  did she hope for it. It was too much. She thought that Allegra would  shy away, stutter, and make up some excuse, but…to pull out that  remark… Allegra understood her error and yammered, but the damage  was done.</p>
<p>“Oh no, Katie, I didn’t mean it  like that! I meant…I’m not sure if it’s something I as a lady  would do— no, wait, I…”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You don’t have to defend what  you said,” Kate stated coldly as she stood up to leave. “I  understand it perfectly well. I didn’t expect you to feel the same  way, Allegra…but I also didn’t expect you to say…what you just  said to me.”</p>
<p>Tears came falling out like precious  gems as she turned and ran, leaving the woman she loved behind, once  more burdened by guilt and sorrow.</p>
