strode across the room, &quot;I have good news.&quot;

Nocturne looked up from where she had been sitting, lighter brown
hair shining as her eyes lit up with cautious happiness. &quot;Have you
found her?&quot; she demanded, pale skin slowing against simple black
clothing.

&quot;Your Anne,&quot; Natasha reported to her crisply, &quot;is alive and well,
and hiding out at the Daughters of Artemis.&quot;

&quot;The Daughters?&quot; Dominique blinked in surprise from where she stood
nearby. The tall redhead shook her head ruefully as she added, &quot;I
should have thought of it, the place is famous for being a sanctuary
to those in need.&quot;

Nocturne looked off into the distance, her own thoughts
racing. &quot;Natasha, would you care to drive me out there this
evening?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Natasha bowed slightly. She hesitated a moment, &quot;You
realize that with the current situation it might be dangerous to be
seen with her?&quot;

&quot;As in?&quot; Nocturne asked.

&quot;She means,&quot; Dominique said quietly, &quot;that if we go see Descent it
might appear that we&#39;re siding with her against Lady Diana.&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t bother me,&quot; Nocturne said firmly. She gentled her tone
after a moment, &quot;But if you two don&#39;t want to come along, I&#39;ll
understand.&quot;

Natasha smiled slightly, &quot;Where you two go, I go m&#39;lady.&quot;

&quot;If I wasn&#39;t here you&#39;d get into more trouble,&quot; Dominique
laughed, &quot;besides, the Lady&#39;s been getting a bit too ambitious. If
your paramour will accept it I&#39;d be glad to help.&quot;

&quot;If she&#39;ll accept it,&quot; Nocturne agreed a bit ruefully, &quot;I&#39;ve noticed
that Descent has been reluctant to put anyone else in danger.&quot;

&quot;Then maybe it&#39;s time we reminded her she has friends,&quot; Natasha
smiled.

Later that evening, shortly after sunset the limo came to a stop in
front of the infamous nightclub, tinted windows shielding the
passengers from the last rays of the sun. Once the dark was fully
come the doors opened, two stylishly dressed vampires emerging.

Nocturne adjusted her skirt, feeling an odd sort of nervousness. She
pushed her carefully designed hair back as she quietly instructed
Natasha, &quot;Please park the car, then join us inside.&quot;

&quot;Of course, madam,&quot; Natasha nodded, then rolled her window back up
then was off.

&quot;Ready?&quot; Dominique asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Nocturne smiled wryly, &quot;but that&#39;s never stopped me.&quot;

The two women walked up the sidewalk then knocked, a young woman
opened the door and let them both in. Inside the Daughters was
crowded, men and women talking energetically, the surface bright but
a clear undercurrent of tension in the air. And up at the bar,
serving drinks smoothly was a very familiar figure.

&quot;You have got to be kidding,&quot; Dominique blinked.

Descent handed a mug of beer to another customer, her pale skin
making her look almost vampiric herself. Only those who knew her
well would recognize how weak she looked, her eyes even more
unearthly than normal, the depleted young woman not even using her
shapeshifting powers to disguise her true nature.

&quot;We&#39;d better go gets some drinks,&quot; Nocturne murmured, the oddest
look on her face. Clearly she had noticed the men and women giving
Descent more than just admiring glances.... and wasn&#39;t terribly
happy about it.

The two vampires&#39; auras were enough to clear the crowds, the people
recognizing a predator when they met one. In a moment they were at
the bar, Descent turning towards them the stopping, a smile tugging
at her lips. Nocturne hesitated, then Descent leaned across the bar
to gently press her lips to the vampire&#39;s.

With the cheers of nearby patrons in the background Descent murmured
to her, &quot;You have no idea how good it is to see you.&quot;

Nocturne smiled back at Descent, &quot;Anne, I was worried about you.&quot;

&quot;Things have been hectic,&quot; Descent said to her apologetically, &quot;why
don&#39;t you grab a table and I&#39;ll join you when I finish here?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be long,&quot; Nocturne said seriously.

As the three collected their drinks and stalked over to a table
Natasha looked over at her mistress and teased, &quot;I think she was
happy to see you.&quot;

Nocturne blushed faintly as Dominique grabbed a chair, settling into
her seat with a purely feline grace. &quot;I suppose she&#39;s doing that to
earn her keep?&quot; she nodded towards where Circe, one of the bar&#39;s
owners, was replacing Descent so that she could join them.

&quot;I doubt that she&#39;d take charity meekly,&quot; Nocturne agreed.

Descent walked over to the table and people cleared the way for her
almost as fast as they did for the vampires. It wasn&#39;t that she was
using her powers or anything else, instead it was the rapidly
spreading knowledge of what she was and what she was capable of.

&quot;Welcome stranger,&quot; Dominique said, her voice having a bit of bite
to it. She had watched Nocturne worry since they had heard about the
attack on Descent and knew how even a word from the woman might have
eased her friend&#39;s pain.

It was something that Descent clearly understood as she sat down,
her expression calm. &quot;I would have called you earlier,&quot; she
explained, &quot;but I was out for nearly a day after what happened.&quot; A
pause, &quot;And I wasn&#39;t sure if contacting you would be wise,
considering.&quot;

&quot;I heard about the attack against you,&quot; Natasha conceded, &quot;they
clearly went for overkill, but we can take care of ourselves.&quot;

Descent shook her head with a sigh, &quot;I thought I could take care of
myself until that kamikaze nearly killed me.&quot;

Nocturne reached out, putting her hand over Descent&#39;s. &quot;So what are
you planning to do now?&quot; she had to ask.

&quot;Keep fighting,&quot; Descent shrugged, &quot;at least now I know that I&#39;m
hurting the Lady, if her reaction is any indication.&quot;

&quot;With our help,&quot; Dominique said crisply. Before Descent could
protest she continued, &quot;We aren&#39;t doing this to help you, the Lady
is clearly out of control. If she isn&#39;t brought down soon she&#39;ll
bring ruin to the underside of the city.&quot;

&quot;And you have other allies as well,&quot; Natasha said with some
amusement. When Descent look at her in surprise she continued, &quot;You
recall when you kicked the pimps out of the region you protect? Well
the Lady tried to send her people back in while you were down.&quot;

Descent&#39;s eyes narrowed in anger, &quot;I&#39;ll have to...&quot;

&quot;The prostitutes were apparently happier with you around,&quot; Natasha
continued, &quot;they&#39;ve gotten together and drove the Lady&#39;s pimps out
again.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Descent blinked.

&quot;In fact things are shifting for the Lady across town,&quot; Nocturne
said, &quot;it seems this attack against you may have been the straw that
broke the camel&#39;s back,&quot;


Descent studied the three women at the table before asking, &quot;What
are you saying?&quot;


&quot;The people aren&#39;t openly supporting you yet,&quot; Natasha
conceded, &quot;they&#39;re too cautious for that, but the Lady isn&#39;t getting
the full support she once did either.&quot;

&quot;So if I bounce back from this attack and keep whittling her down,&quot;
Descent mused aloud, &quot;I may be able to win?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Dominique agreed.

Gently Nocturne squeezed Descent&#39;s hand, cradling it in her
own. &quot;Let people help you,&quot; she said softly, &quot;you have more allies
than you know.&quot;

Descent smiled back, then nodded slightly.</pre>
