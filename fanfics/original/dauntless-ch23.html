<p>“Mission of the Bloody Dove: yo  ho-ho, a damsel in distress!”</p>
<p>“I told ya already, I don’t  know what came over me,” Rose said sourly. “Something just made  me want that hat really bad. The thing is, I got so caught up with  that piece of shit that I forgot to get what I <em>really</em> came  there for! Lasses, if ever you see that scurvy <em>Dauntless</em> with  those two goddesses behind the helm, give me a scream and we’ll  take back what’s ours!”</p>
<p>“Aye, Captain!”</p>
<p>“Actually,” Patches murmured,  “we might have to hold off on that for awhile. I’m getting a  distress signal from the Nimbus system—place of origin is the moon  of their main planet, Cumulus. Want me to patch it through?”</p>
<p>“Sure, go ahead.” There was no  visual but the audio was enough to grab the pirates’ attention. A  young woman’s voice called out to them, choked with desperation.</p>
<p>To all vessels passing the Nimbus  system outside the jurisdiction of the Royal Stratus house, I am  Princess Cirrus Stratus, and I beg for your assistance. I repeat, I  am Princess Cirrus Stratus, and if anybody is listening, the kingdom  is in bleak jeopardy. Please respond, anybody!</p>
<p>“That’s the whole reel,”  Patches said. “So whaddya think, Cap’n? Should we make a pit  stop?”</p>
<p>“Sure, why the hell not?” Rose  sang arrogantly. “You know I can never turn down a request from a  lady, and she sounds cute. But let’s make this a kidnapping, just  in case.”</p>
<p>“And what do we do with her after  we kidnap her?” Natalie said, grinning lustfully. Rose swatted her  bare bottom with the flat of her blade.</p>
<p>“Keep your mind outta the gutter,  Nats. We’ll all have our fun once we’ve figured out the whole  story.” The <em>Bloody Dove</em> quickly changed course and barreled  through the darkness of space to meet the cloudy damsel in distress.  True to its name, the Nimbus system was solely populated by gas  worlds, but almost all of them were habitable, and they were ruled by  the benevolent but distant Cloud Kingdom, which had been independent  from the rest of the galaxy’s armies and bureaucracies eons before  its discovery. Visitors were welcomed and treated warmly these days,  but in most cases, they were not encouraged to stay very long. The  Royal Family had been in isolation for millennia and it preferred to  cling to its old ways for as long as possible.</p>
<p>Only the moons of Nimbus were  solid, and all save one were inhospitable wastelands, much like the  satellites of the Helios system. Cumulus, the only exception, was  strictly reserved for the royal family and could not be despoiled by  common feet lest a member of royalty grant them special pardon. That  the princess should so boldly invite perfect strangers to this  forbidden realm gave the Dead Rose pirates an idea of how serious the  situation was, and they raised their guard. They had been through </p>
<p>scenarios like this many times  before, when an innocent party requested their aid, and few of them  turned out to be legitimate. There was no teeming armada to greet  them this time, though, nor a platoon of soldiers ready to imprison  them—nor anything, for that matter, save for a large bare spot  reserved for the first good Samaritan to land, and of course the  princess herself, who stood waiting patiently even as the pirate ship  made port.</p>
<p>“Hot damn, she’s a looker!”  Patches screeched. All the pirates clamored out to see, a great  noise of whistles, howls, and catcalls rising as they beheld the  beleaguered woman. Despair and torment had carved a very tragic,  ethereal beauty on her face: she was as pale as the clouds  themselves, fair but with curly hair darker than the storms, and she  had a regal dress that humbly glowed with a misty blue, like the sky  when dawn has approached on a clear day. She had no jewels save a  pearl headband that kept her hair from flapping, and as was the  custom on Cumulus, her feet were bare.</p>
<p>“She is pretty,” Rose admitted. “Damn, I hate playing rough with something like that! You don’t  see too many maidens like her anymore. Duchess, you come with me,  and the rest of you horn-dogs, stay put! I don’t need you  slobbering all over her!”</p>
<p>“But why only Duchess?” they  whined. Rose snapped at them harshly and swung her sword in the air.</p>
<p>“Get your heads outta that  woman’s cleavage for a second and think! Who else here even  remotely resembles a sophisticated lady? Hell, even I’d throw that  woman off, and I’m the biggest fucking socialite on this ship! So  Duchess comes with me to make sure she’s comfortable, <em>comprende-vous</em>? Let’s go.” The crew was still downcast  as their Captain and the lucky helmswoman left the ship, but they  were a loyal crew: they would obey Rose even if it meant holding  back their wild sexual rampaging.</p>
<p>“You’re a silly fool,” said  Rose as she saluted the princess. “Only an ignorant little brat  that’s spent too many hours getting her pink ass pampered in some  froofy drawing-room would broadcast a distress signal for every  sleaze, scumbag, and no-good scallywag to listen to! Just look at  the people that took your little bait!” Rose was expecting Cirrus  to back away in defeat, or at least humiliation, and smiled as she  noticed the princess had not budged an inch. In fact, her steely  crimson eyes were firm and strong, like the burning sphere above, and  she stood as if transfixed upon the very foundation of the moon  itself.</p>
<p>“I had no alternative,” she  answered plainly. “Are you here to help me or not?”</p>
<p>“Please don’t pay any attention  to the Captain’s rude behavior,” Duchess said as she approached  the princess. She bowed politely, finally educing a tiny smile. “We  Dead Roses are accustomed to subtler greetings, I’m afraid. She’s  really very kind, you know, just not respectful.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Born and raised,” Rose said  proudly with another salute. “So what can we pirates do for you?” Cirrus didn’t even flinch at the mention of pirates, which  indicated this situation was darker and grimmer than even Rose could  imagine.</p>
<p>“How many do you have?”</p>
<p>“A hundred, on and off, every  lass loyal and strong.”</p>
<p>“That will do,” she murmured to  herself. “Are there any that have skill with picking locks, or  theft, or skulking around?” Rose snickered and gave Duchess a  condescending expression.</p>
<p>“Maybe I forgot to mention we’re  pirates.”</p>
<p>“Forgive  me, but I needed to  know,” Cirrus replied. “You see—and this might sound strange  to you—a certain item has taken over my mother’s mind, and every  attempt at removing or destroying it has…well, they have all  failed. Every friend that I’ve been able to summon has either been  imprisoned, exiled, or…executed. I’m at the end of my rope here;  I’ve exhausted all my other resources. I realize that my distress  call was foolhardy, but as I said, I had no other options before me. I  love my mother dearly and she is the only family I have left, and  if you could only see her before the change went into affect…” Here the  young woman’s strength finally waned, and her posture bent  as untold months and years of misery weighed her down. As  disrespectful as Rose was, though, she understood the stab of  hopelessness and didn’t blame the young woman for breaking.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of items like this  before,” she said once Cirrus regained her composure. “Actually…I  may have been under the influence of one recently. Most of em’ are  the work of that damned Elvish race, but I’ve heard that a few were  made by Wizards—real ones, too, and so long ago. I sincerely  apologize for insulting you earlier, Princess Cirrus. Rest assured  the Dead Roses won’t give up until this thing is destroyed and your  mother’s been freed.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she sighed,  shedding tears of relief.</p>
<p>“So what is this object called,”  Duchess asked, “and what does it look like—and would you know  where it is right now?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rebecca’s heart was pounding  hard, and a portion of her mind told her that she could really talk  to anybody about this. But no matter what defense she put up or who  she gazed at in an attempt to cover the truth, she was irresistibly  drawn to Riene Latoli and wanted to speak with <em>her</em>. She had  told herself there was no way a cultured, debonair lady like her  would ever associate with a fifth-rate tomboy pretending to be a  superhero, but her legs and her heart drew her to Riene’s room  anyway and she knocked on the door with the hope that Riene’s  civility would shine through and tolerate Rebecca’s presence for a  few minutes at least. It opened, to her frayed delight, and Riene  smiled in a way that indicated she was pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>“Rebecca! I hardly ever see you  around anymore!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, just one adventure after  another. Umm, is it okay if I come in to talk?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you have lunch with  me? I’ve been napping ever since we came back and I haven’t had  a thing to eat.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, did I wake  you?”</p>
<p>“Yes,”  she replied cheerfully,  “but you’re a very good alarm clock. Why don’t we order  something and then find a nice quiet table to sit down?” The very  thought of being in relative privacy with Riene gave Rebecca’s  nervous heart wings, and she almost danced the rest of the way. Riene  smiled beautifully as this mysterious, gorgeous, strong warrior  walked by her side; the temptation to reach out and hold her hand was  outstanding. In truth, Riene had been groggy and bitter when she was  rudely jerked away from her warm, soft bed, but seeing the angelic  Rebecca brightened her moment. And she wanted to talk! She felt so  unworthy wasting this goddess’s time, but she wasn’t about to  complain about it!</p>
<p>“Hi, Kate,” Rebecca said as she  passed through the kitchen. “You all been busy?”</p>
<p>“On and off. I really wish  everyone would stick to the same schedule. You’re so lucky that  you don’t have a shift today.”</p>
<p>“Luck of the draw, I guess.” Due to Chandra’s increased negligence and the erratic eating  schedules and habits of the crew, the few people who could cook took  turns making meals for everybody, and now Kate was handling  everything. She had greatly improved ever since the infamous cooking  contest not long ago (Valti had only just finished mopping up tomato  sauce and pieces of tentacle goo), and though she still had a long  way to go, she learned quickly and was happy to be working. The  dining room was virtually abandoned that time of day (which was why  Kate was in the kitchen and not a more experienced chef), so Riene  and Rebecca had their pick. They chose a distant table in the corner  and sat down, picking quietly.</p>
<p><em>Is this a date,</em> Rebecca  hoped.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if she meant for this  to be a date,</em> Riene thought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So what did you want to talk to  me about?”</p>
<p>“You had more fun the other day  than I did,” Rebecca pointed. “My team just stood outside and  covered your back. I’ve always wanted to explore the Panther’s  Tomb, but when I finally got my chance, I chickened out and stayed  behind. I guess that was for the best—I mean, I probably would’ve  been useless in there.” Riene shook her head quietly.</p>
<p>“I could’ve used you. I  actually wished you had come with us. There was a deep pool of water  in there and…ugh! Aseria actually dove in.”</p>
<p>“Are you afraid of water?” she  asked delicately. Riene smiled.</p>
<p>“No, of course not. I just hate  the idea of drowning. It was a deep place… But at least I made  myself useful in there. We <em>really</em> needed you, though.”</p>
<p>“When?” Riene took a deep  breath and mindlessly prodded her food.</p>
<p>“This  journey we’re all on  requires more than strength and intelligence, or skill, or talent. I  know it sounds cheesy, but everyone really does have her uses here,  and…if the situation called for it, everyone could prove very  powerful. Just look at Vimmy: she’s small, frantic, vain, and oh  yeah, let’s not forget the chatter!” They chuckled for awhile,  each one briefly captivated by the beauty of the other’s mirth. “But  when it comes to the economy, or money in general, we couldn’t  ask for a better ally. Naja and Lil…they’re obnoxious, and  frankly not entirely virtuous people, but they’ve saved our lives a  hundred times over. Shana looks like an ordinary kid, but I don’t  even think we could’ve made it out of Bibliopolis without her. And  you…”</p>
<p>For the first time since they met,  Riene looked Rebecca straight in the eye, and all of time and space  seemed to freeze as each one mirrored the full gamut of human thought  and feeling. “Fixing and modifying weapons is a nice skill,”  Riene whispered, “but I think you’re best at raising other  people’s morale. There’s a certain air about you that makes  things…happier, and better than when you’re not around. At  least,” she murmured with a soft blush, “that’s how I feel.” A long, slow silence passed between them as Rebecca let these words  permeate her skin and penetrate through into deeper, more spiritual  realms. In so many words, Riene had said “I like being around  you”, and even if she meant that to be strictly platonic, it was  better than she could’ve ever hoped.</p>
<p>“You sure are good at changing  the subject,” she said at last. They laughed quietly and Riene  resumed telling her about all the perils of the Panther’s Tomb.</p>
<p>Since  the adventure inside the  Panther’s Tomb was so wearying on everybody, Amy decided to give  the crew a few days to rest before suggesting the next destination.  Since she was relying on distance and not precedence, Amy looked  through the requests to see which was the closest to their </p>
<p>current location. Going on Rose’s  expedition had thrown them off course a bit, so now they were  actually closer to Sharyn’s treasure than anyone else’s. Naja,  who would’ve gotten her way if the <em>Dauntless</em> had not turned  around so suddenly, was understandably furious, but Amy withstood her  complaints peacefully and ended up making a compromise with her.</p>
<p>“When we’ve finished getting  Sharyn’s treasure, I’ll personally come along with you when we  find the Nail of Saigrim, I promise. And you can hold me to that.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I will!” she  had snapped. Naja then remembered that Amy was hardly in any  condition to go traveling with her and had pointed this out. “But  you’re gonna hold me back, you know. I may just cut that foot  off.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome to try,” Amy  had answered calmly, “but before you go looking for a hacksaw,  remember that I have a genie for a friend, and she’ll do whatever I  tell her, and that includes helping you.” Naja had paused for a  moment and frowned as she tried to make sense of this.</p>
<p>“Um…so you won’t be coming  with me alone?”</p>
<p>“I never said that,” she  smiled. Naja had actually laughed and shook her head in surprise.</p>
<p>“You are one tricky bitch, doc! Okay, I’ll hold you to your word, but you’d better keep it! Otherwise—“</p>
<p>“If I don’t,” Amy had  answered coolly, “I’ll give you the hacksaw myself and hold back  on the anesthetic.”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Amy said to  herself as Sharyn walked into her room with the Tome of Treasures,  “now I’ll have to negotiate with whoever was originally after  Sharyn. Rose certainly had an inconvenient way of repaying her debt. Hello! So where is it you’d like to visit?”</p>
<p>“A place which holds sublime  significance to my life, my quest, and my people,” the young woman  answered, flipping the virtual pages until she came to her spot. “Hast thou ever heard of the Cloud Kingdom?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“There are few who have. It has  hitherto been isolated and ostracized from alien contact. Their  doors opened but recently, a century ago methinks, whereupon my  people rejoiced, for within their magnificent walls lies a treasure  worth more than gold or jewels. Do ye know of the Standard of  Andvari? Ah, tis’ an item sought above all else in New Avalon;  tis’ said a mere glance revives the spirit of even the most  downtrodden. Harvests increase to overflowing, enemies shirk back in  terror, friends flock and become graceful, the elderly feel young and  the young feel wise. My land hath been gloomy and bleak for many an  age; I myself grew up in poverty, though my father was a fine man and  a heroic knight. Void Dragons hath beset us with unjustified wrath,  and many have placed their hopes in me, who decided to venture  outside our walls seeking this Standard. O dearest Amy, if ever you  considered </p>
<p>yourself my friend, prithee do it  now, and grant me leave to visit the Cloud Kingdom. The Nimbus  system hast becometh mine hope.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>A  much smaller team accompanied  Sharyn to Stratus, since most of the others were still bushed from  all their earlier travels. Since everything was still on a  volunteer-only base, Lyara volunteered first, mostly because she felt  deep in her heart that Sharyn would need her for this task. She  still remembered lashing out at the impressionable young woman on  Reversa, and even though it hadn’t been her fault and Sharyn had  forgiven her long ago, she wanted to do something to lift the guilt  and prove herself. Speaking of people wanting to prove themselves,  Alala came along, and did everything in her power to keep Yenae away  (even though all it took in the end was a simple “no thank you”). Of  course, since Sharyn was now directly involving herself in a  task, Vimmy went with her in the hopes of settling her debt (when she  and Mink picked up the young woman and gave her a ride), and where  Vimmy went, Mink was sure to follow.</p>
<p>“I say, dear friend, if this  Standard is half as important as you think it is, you could easily  give it to me once you’re finished with it, yes, once you’re <em>done</em>, in other words, and that would clear everything nice and  square, I think it’s a bargain, and I wouldn’t even try to take  it for myself first, no, your story was touching, it really struck my  heart, such selfless philanthropy is missing these days, so please  take it and use it, my dear, by all means, but once you’re, erm, <em>finished</em>, do kindly let me have a look at it, yes, a very  long, <em>careful</em> look.”</p>
<p>“Greedy little monster, aren’t  you?” Alala growled, giving the petite Norgrin a soft kick. Vimmy  squealed and went into a tirade about how “beautiful businesswomen  should not be abused by the economically inferior”, and this  started a squabble between two very strong-willed women which was  thankfully cut short by Lyara.</p>
<p>“Both of you, shut up!! We’re  not here to satisfy your greed or your ego, we’re here to help save  Sharyn’s people! Honestly, why don’t you grow up?”</p>
<p>“Hey,  I’m pretty mature for  my—“ A single glare silenced Alala’s retort, but Lyara sent a  secret telepathic message just in case she didn’t get the hint. Vimmy  grumbled about how she was being treated like a martyr, but  never loud enough to draw attention, and Sharyn walked ahead, silent  with Mink, both humbly glowing with faint happiness.</p>
<p><em>She stuck up for me! Lyara’s  really starting to come out of her shell.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>I was hoping somebody would put  Master Vimmy in her place.</em></p>
<p>“So what does this Standard look  like?” Lyara asked once everything had calmed down. “And do you  know where it is?”</p>
<p>“The Tome indicated it would  decorate the mantle above the royal thrones, so we shall move there  and judge the next course of action. Tis’ unmistakable, this  Standard: a silver tortoise bearing six limbs and two heads rests  atop a field of lush green, and the sky doth offer a backdrop, lined  with wisps.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like the unholy offspring  of Valti and the Acheron twins,” Alala muttered.</p>
<p>“Tis’ a harbinger of good  fortune, so let not its appearance deceive thee.” Alala shrugged  casually and stuck close to the group, distancing herself from Vimmy,  as they approached the royal castle. Customs hadn’t been as  nightmarish as they thought with Riene negotiating their way through  (Sharyn’s strange manner of speaking also impressed ground  control), and after a bit of formal conversation, Sharyn and her  accomplices were labeled as guests of Queen Alto Stratus, privileged  with exploring her home and visiting her when summoned.</p>
<p>Those blessed enough to study the  grace and dignity of the princess would instantly see the family  resemblance: Queen Alto was striking in her mature beauty and  commanded great respect and love with the smallest gestures as she  bade her guests to enter, slowly. Her hair was much longer than her  daughter’s, and it was flecked with dim silver and tied up to  expose her silky neck, but age had clearly been kind to her and she  wore her years proudly, although her ruby eyes did not even hold half  the life they once did. She sat up perfectly straight and spoke  slowly, her voice rich and thoughtful, but a careful observer could  notice how stiff she seemed, and how her joints sometimes twitched,  like she was being pulled on a string. She never made anybody really  feel at ease; she was just too intimidating and radiant. You really  felt obligated to kneel before her.</p>
<p>“It is our pleasure to welcome  you and offer our hospitality,” she droned mechanically (if  richness can be mechanical). “We see an Elf, graceful and wise,  and a Yun, thoughtful and deliberate. There is also a Norgrin,  avaricious and cunning, and one who could readily assimilate into our  guard, if she did not seem so sickly. The catgirl is also welcome,  though we would command her to refrain from her harlotry.”</p>
<p>“I’m <em>not</em> a harlot,”  Alala hissed furiously.</p>
<p>“Tis’ my natural color,  esteemed highness!” Sharyn exclaimed. “And I beg of thee to  forgive my feline friend. Her chastity and valor are equal to my  own.”</p>
<p>“Then we apologize, unless you  are a harlot yourself, emerald girl. Tell us, what brings you to  visit Stratus? Long have we been in isolation, and too few years  since have been spent in the company of aliens.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“My companions and I wish to  behold the Standard raised yonder, and with your permission, borrow  it briefly for the improvement of my kin.” The five of them didn’t  even need to wait a second for the Queen’s answer: the moment  Sharyn uttered “Standard”, Alto’s eyebrow raised indignantly  and her cold fury was summoned. Her expression and tone of voice did  not change in the least as she ordered her visitors imprisoned, and  upon the morning of the next day, executed.</p>
<p>But Vimmy sure did make a scene.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>“Hey, what do you think you’re  doing, don’t you know who I am, you can’t handle Vimmy Fonester  like this, I know <em>people</em>, you’ll see, they’ll hear about  this and you’ll be wishing you hadn’t treated me so poorly, this  cell reeks, and what about my last meal, do you realize how  uncivilized it is to execute someone simply for no—mmphhn  phnnmff?!”</p>
<p>“<em>Thank</em> you!” Lyara  exclaimed as the guards gagged Vimmy. They smiled thinly, happy to  be of service, and continued their rounds. Lyara mirrored their dead  expression and glanced at Mink, who was blankly staring into space. “It  was worth being thrown in the slammer just to have her shut up  for a moment.”</p>
<p>“Mm,” she nodded. Sharyn was  pacing back and forth, wringing her hands and muttering incoherently.  She could face death all right, but not an unjust death, and she  couldn’t understand why anybody would be executed for mentioning  the Standard of Andvari.</p>
<p>“Mayhaps my quest includes  liberating it through force,” she deduced doubtfully.</p>
<p>“Will you quit your babbling?”  Alala growled as she picked at the cell’s lock. “We’ll be  outta here in five minutes, so figure out what you wanna do.”</p>
<p>“What I wish to do?” Sharyn  stopped pacing and focused her doubt on the studious catgirl.</p>
<p>“Yeah. You brought us here, so  whaddya wanna do now? We can’t just ask for that thing, but I  don’t wanna steal it either, and I don’t like the idea of giving  up.”</p>
<p>“My intention was to retrieve the  Standard and use it for the betterment of my people,” Sharyn  answered firmly. “Diplomacy hath failed us, that much is certain,  and if the Queen’s guards espy us, we shall be incarcerated  again—or else killed outright. I do not wish to resort to  pilfering, but if this Queen doth refuse her aid, she ranks below a  villain!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“But do your ends justify the  means?” Lyara wondered rhetorically. “Who’s to say they don’t  need it here? We should take it, certainly, but we should confront  the Queen once we have it, and state our case out loud. If she  refuses then, we may not have any other choice.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got no problem beating up  wicked people,” Alala said as she finally solved the lock. The  cell door opened and she jumped for victory. “Ha! There hasn’t  been a prison yet that can hold me!”</p>
<p>“Yenae would be proud,” Lyara  teased her. “In any case, let’s figure out what we’re going to  do. What’s the plan, Sharyn?”</p>
<p>“We shall need infiltrators to  spirit the Standard away covertly. Lady Alala, I count on thee for  this task, and Lady Mink, thou as well.”</p>
<p>“Sounds fine.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me! But just  ‘Alala’ will do.”</p>
<p>“Ah, as you will. Ladies Tanith,  Fonester, I shall ask thy aid for distracting the guards. Lady  Fonester, this is where your skills will be the most required. Wilt  thou perform accordingly?” She gently removed Vimmy’s gag and  smiled softly; the petite entrepreneur wiped her mouth and sighed.</p>
<p>“Oh all right, I think I know  what you have in mind, dear, but let’s be quick about it, this  place rubs me the wrong way, but bother, I’m hungry, Mink, would  you happen to have anything to—“</p>
<p>“Shut up and let’s go,” Lyara  barked as she dragged the energetic woman away.</p>
<p>Very  little had changed around the  royal estate since Sharyn and her crew of four were thrown in prison.  Dusk was now closing in on the world and soon it would be night;  stars were already poking through the inky ceiling, and torches were  being lit everywhere. The guard had doubled, which was exactly what  Sharyn expected: they would need the increased security during the  night, and surely their previous attempt helped increase the numbers!  This Queen was shrewd, no mistake there, but Sharyn felt blessed to  be around so many capable friends.</p>
<p>“We shall draw as many away as we  can,” she said to Alala and Mink. “Once ye feel tis’ safe,  entrench thyself inside and slink along as you can. I urge thee both  to take care; I hath a negative sentiment concerning this.”</p>
<p>“Just  leave it to us!” Alala  exclaimed, clenching her fist in excitement. Mink nodded blankly,  but Vimmy could tell she was really having a lot of fun. It was her  job to waddle into town and (as much as she despised the idea) throw  her money around wildly, raising as much of a ruckus as possible. Lyara  would send telepathic messages to the guards, confusing them as  Sharyn moved in to disable them. She </p>
<p>had no problems wielding her sword,  but preferred only to use it on her enemies, and realistically, these  men were only doing their jobs.</p>
<p>“Well,  here I go,” Vimmy  wailed, so crestfallen that she didn’t even continue her tirade. She  drew in a great breath and ran screaming down the venues and  alleys, throwing fistfuls of gold as she announced her generosity to  the world. The town was soon crawling with people, and the guards  chased after them to calm the uproar. Lyara directed her thoughts to  their minds and also to the minds of those who stayed behind; Sharyn  struck them down with the pommel and flat of her blade. Alala and  Mink crept inside during the chaos, found the Standard, grabbed it,  furled it up, and crept back without so much as disturbing a single  grain of dust.</p>
<p>“Ah, excellent! My heart is  sorrowful to commit such vulgar acts, but what must be done must be  done. Let us meet the Queen and plead our case!”</p>
<p>“Not so fast!” Sharyn’s hand  went straight for her sword and she inched it out as she glared at  her challenger. Alala looked disturbed but calm, Mink was as  emotionally cold as ever (though there was a small trace of  uneasiness in her eyes), and once Lyara and Vimmy joined them, the  latter sobbing profusely, they jerked to a halt and bristled (well,  Vimmy was far too upset to be bothered by anything else, and didn’t  even notice the company). The Dead Roses stood between them and a  clean getaway.</p>
<p>“Sorry about the cliché,” Rose  grinned craftily, “but I’ve always wanted to use it and I figured  it’d get your attention. So what do we have here, old friends? If  I had known you’d resort to piracy, I’d recruit your sweet  asses.”</p>
<p>“This is a matter that concerns  thee not, foul Rose,” Sharyn muttered darkly. Rose brightened at  this latest insult and laughed.</p>
<p>“<em>Foul</em> Rose? Now that’s  a new one. But all playful bantering aside, I’d like for you all  to move away, unless you wanna help me. We’re looking for the  Standard of Andvari, and as grateful as we are that you all got rid  of security, we’d prefer it if you didn’t get in our way. So <em>sil  vous plait</em>…” Sharyn took a careful step back and squeezed  the scrolled-up Standard defensively. She drew her sword out all the  way. Lyara rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“T’was I who claimed it first,  foul Rose.”</p>
<p>“You’re acting like a brat,  Shar,” the elf sighed. “Rose, why do you need that thing? Is it  just another pretty decoration?”</p>
<p>“I can handle mine own  negotiations, Lady Tanith!!” Sharyn snapped. Everyone else decided  to stay out of the conflict and left it up to the two women and their  hapless mediator. Rose sighed gently and lowered her sword; she had  to remember this was a hotheaded young woman fresh out of training  school.</p>
<p>“You know, a wise man once told  me that if your eyes are too wide, you’ll go blind. I think he  meant that you couldn’t take such an innocent view of the world. Good and evil are subjective…and all </p>
<p>that  futzpah. Look, babbling aside,  the princess here—“ She gestured to a beautiful, pale woman who  greatly resembled the Queen they had met earlier, “She told us that  the Standard you have there has taken control of her mother’s soul,  or whatever. Look, it’s basically a magic artifact that somebody  gave the Queen in the hopes of patching up some conflict, I dunno.  Cirrus here can tell you about it if you’re really interested. The  point is, I promised this woman I’d set fire to that thing, and if  you’re not gonna cooperate with me and force me to go back on my  word, I’m afraid we’ll have to cross swords.”</p>
<p>“Would that I could trust a fox  such as thee,” Sharyn muttered darkly. “Brigands such as thyself  caused the downfall of many good estates when my people thought their  famines and depressions concluded, and I hath not once lowered mine  guard in thy presence. They suffer still, friends and family I hath  known since birth, and this Standard may be their only remedy! Thou  sayest mine eyes are too broad, my shoulders too light, my experience  too scant…yet many dark times I’ve spent hoping beyond all  measure. What wouldst thou have me do, now that my greatest wish  hast been granted?”</p>
<p>“The real question is,” Rose  said quietly, “would you really allow Cirrus’s mother to continue  leading her kingdom to ruin? Furthermore, what makes you think that  Standard will do everything you say?”</p>
<p>“And hast thou a right to say  different?!” Their swords both glittered in starlight and  firelight: the only way to settle this would be through dual.</p>
<p>“You’re  both such children,”  Lyara sighed wearily, “but I guess now it can’t be helped.” They  charged and fought each other methodically at first, gauging the  other’s strength and style. Sharyn drew first blood as she slashed  at Rose’s coat, but Rose’s cutlass couldn’t even scratch  Sharyn’s armor. The pirate stepped back, let out a breath, and  began removing her outer garments: cloak, vest, and bodice, leaving  only a comfortable, light corset protecting her. Sharyn turned red:  Rose appeared quite feminine without her pirate’s clothes.</p>
<p>“Don’t give me a disadvantage,  girl,” she stated bitterly. “Take off your armor and face me  like a woman!” Sharyn hesitated for a moment, but understood what  the older lady was implying. She was humiliated for going into this  dual wearing her armor, which could protect against the claws of a  Void Dragon, and quickly unclasped it. She threw it to the side  along with the Standard, and stood shivering in a humble white tunic  before her enemy. Rose allowed her sexual arousal to peak for a  moment before the battle continued.</p>
<p>The pirate was much faster and  stronger than Sharyn anticipated, and fought ferociously, a predatory  grin on her face as she pushed the younger woman back. Rose had an  advantage in height and experience, and her blade was much easier to  handle, but Sharyn was hoping her skill as a swordswoman would be  greater. Rose’s style didn’t seem to follow any of the rules  Sharyn had been brought up with, and just as soon as the knight  thought she had figured her opponent out, Rose would change strategy  and surprise her in mid-slash. She cut open a fine gash on Sharyn’s  leg just as the young woman was preparing for a colossal swing, and  she stumbled back, grimacing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Just as I thought,” Rose  sighed flatly as she bounced her cutlass. “You’re still just a  kid. You follow rules and order without a single question, until the  last shred of your humanity is gone and you’re nothing more than a  robot. You really think your actions are justified, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Be  silent! Thou hast not won  yet!” Sharyn continued pressing Rose and renewed her attack, but  the older woman was far too cunning to lose to a braggart and an  idealist. Fun was fun, but this was battle, and the victory would go  to the one who had seen both good and evil, and could judge fairly.  Rose lightly cut Sharyn on the side of her neck, making her stumble  and clutch the wound fearfully. It was only a scratch—but it was  also a warning.</p>
<p>“So what if your people need a  miracle? They can make their own. I can’t stand people who whine  and complain about their lives, but are so lazy they won’t even  bother to change it. Those are the weakest people in the world, and  they deserve their torment.”</p>
<p>“Thou shalt not insult them,”  she growled, rising to stand on wobbly feet. “Thou hast no idea  the kind of misery we hath seen!”</p>
<p>“So let them do something about  it!” Rose screamed as she attacked Sharyn full force. She fell  back and the pirate kicked her hard in the face, bending her nose and  blackening an eye. She ran in for the kill but Sharyn wriggled and  brandished her blade like a wild animal, barely fending off her  attacker. She stood back and waited for her opponent to stand;  Sharyn looked like a different person now, and their audience started  to show concern.</p>
<p>“Of course I know what misery  is,” Rose stated coolly. “Every woman aboard my ship has had her  fair share of it. My own family was killed by marauders—real ones  too, not the honest criminals we are. I lost brother and sister  both; I can understand what people like you are going through. But  I’m <em>doing</em> something about it, too. Patches and Natalie were  brothel-girls before I took them in. Duchess was going to be sold to  a slave-trader. Torch was trapped in the most godforsaken orphanage  you could imagine. Henrietta had her leg ripped off in an accident  without a soul to care for her. My heart is jealous for women like  these; I can’t help but love them. Now Cirrus and her mother need  my help too, and I’ll be damned if I’m going to allow some  selfish little fucker get in my way! You fight or you die, Sharyn!”</p>
<p>Rose came after her like a force of  nature, and Sharyn knew she couldn’t hold up much longer. She  fought well all the same, but now a great doubt was creeping into her  heart. If Rose was right, then if she took the Standard as her own,  wouldn’t she be committing an evil? But forsaking it would be just  as wrong, wouldn’t it? Her mind became clear as her sword crossed  with Rose’s, and her arm seemed to move all on its own, raising her  weapon until it opened a flow of scarlet. Blood spurted from Rose’s  face as she dropped her sword and clutched her wound; Sharyn quickly  kicked her enemy’s weapon away and held a blade to her neck. Rose  slowly caught her breath, and in spite of the searing pain, she  smiled.</p>
<p>“Heh…quite a beauty mark you  gave me, kiddo. Looks like you won. Go ahead and do what you feel  is right.” Her voice had dropped so rapidly into somber defeat  that it struck a chord deep in Sharyn’s heart, and her doubt  increased. She picked up the Standard and her armor, and slowly  dressed </p>
<p>herself  as her mind wandered. To  keep it would save her people, but at the cost of an innocent woman’s  mind, and possibly an entire kingdom. But to destroy it was to lose  it forever, and any hope she had of reviving her beloved New Avalon.  Sharyn stood poised on this great razor’s edge and realized she was  now being forced to make a gruesome decision. She would bring grief  to somebody no matter what the outcome—it all came down to a  stranger’s life versus the civilization of her people. It would be  the last decision she made before really becoming a woman.</p>
<p>With a piercing scream, she thrust  the banner into a torch, and turned away from the blaze, tears  pouring down her face.</p>
<p>“I  hope I did the right thing,”  she whispered, sobbing quietly. She looked up at her friends, who  had witnessed everything silently, and trembled in fear and defeat. “Oh  Lyara, prithee tell me I did the right thing.” She didn’t  really expect an answer; she just wanted the older woman to hold her.  Lyara was quite happy to do this at least.</p>
<p>“Um, Miss?” Sharyn turned her  head and saw Princess Cirrus standing behind her, aglow with joy as  her own eyes overflowed. “Uh…thank you. My family is…in your  service. We can’t…uh, ever repay you…for what you did…”</p>
<p>“Mention it not,” Sharyn  sighed, and she meant it. The young woman did not want to dwell on  her decision any more. Rose approached her next, a bandage over her  wound and a look of deep respect radiating from her face. She smiled  at Sharyn, extended her hand, and the two shook as equals.</p>
<p>But just to be safe, she kissed her,  too.</p>
<p>“Thieves! Thieves! Somebody has  stolen our Standard! Catch them! Kill them!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Damn it!” Rose swore as she  pulled away from her shocked adversary. “Right when I was gonna  cop a feel, too! Hey Princess, wasn’t your mother supposed to be  cured?”</p>
<p>“Well, I thought—“ The Queen  suddenly burst outside, livid and frantic as a banshee, and yelled in  agony as the last shreds of the Standard of Andvari were consumed by  the torch and became smoke and ash. She fainted—Mink and Cirrus  were at her side immediately—and ten guards rushed outside, looking  for blood.</p>
<p>“What’s happened? What have  you done to her Highness? Where’s the royal banner?”</p>
<p>“It’s gone to Hell, you  pricks!!” Rose screamed. The guards suddenly relaxed and put their  weapons away.</p>
<p>“Then we owe you our thanks. Long have we suspected that device had played a part in changing her  Majesty’s spirit, but we could do nothing about it, lest her anger  devour us as well. Through sheer love alone were we able to stay by  her side.”</p>
<p>“Yada, yada, yada,” Rose  snapped impatiently. “So everything’s fixed and happy for good,  huh? Princess, I’d better scramble before—“</p>
<p>“No, you don’t understand!”  the guards exclaimed fearfully. “The Queen’s new temperament  brought many enemies to our doorstep, and the only thing keeping them  from performing a coup was the very hellishness that brought them! Now that she’s back to her old self—we hope…“</p>
<p>“She will be,” Cirrus insisted  as she cradled her mother’s head. The change to Alto’s face was  as obvious as daylight: she looked younger and full of benevolence,  and if her eyes had been open and her consciousness restored, she  would’ve laughed and sang for merriment, as she once did.</p>
<p>“I think I know where this is  going,” said Rose as she picked the unconscious woman up. “Princess, it looks like this is the end of your family. There’s  no way you’ve got enough loyal followers like these guys to help  you. I’m afraid that if you don’t move it, all our efforts’ll  be for nothing.”</p>
<p>“But where should we go?” she  wailed. Rose looked back at her and winked.</p>
<p>“Well, have you ever considered  piracy?” The princess gasped in shock, but the look of honesty and  love was so prevalent in Rose’s eyes that even the guards trusted  their lieges to her care. One of them helped her carry the Queen and  the others cleared a path for her—and since Sharyn had experienced  the true heart of her rival first hand, she and her friends were  right there with them, never leaving their side until everyone had  safely boarded and the <em>Bloody Dove</em> was well on her way.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>“I guess it goes to show that you  can’t achieve happiness without sacrifice,” Alto Stratus remarked  once she was told the full story. Needless to say, she was surprised  by it all, especially when her daughter informed her they would both  be proud members of the Dead Roses from now on, and their days as  Queen and Princess were now only memories. But she took it fairly  well, and after resting and having something to eat, she went right  to work and became immensely popular onboard. Rose felt happy to  have two wonderful women as fellow scallywags, and with a final  thanks to the green-skinned goddess who had made all this possible,  she set the course of the <em>Bloody Dove</em> in motion and sailed off  into the deeps of space, ready for her next adventure.</p>
