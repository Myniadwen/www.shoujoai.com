~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Prepare to descend into the netherworld, little boy.&quot;

There was nothing Saizaki could do. The Fire Cutter was out of its hand 
so he could not use its magic to defend himself. And if he tried to 
move, Diana would gun him down for sure. The glow around Diana&#39;s 
fingertip grew in size and brightness. Saizaki&#39;s eyes slipped shut 
because he knew this would be the killing blow...

&quot;Thunder Shot!&quot;

Diana&#39;s attention went to her right instantly. An arrow-shaped wave of 
crystal blue energy came straight for her. Diana swerved her hand to the 
bolt, and fired one of her own. The blast was ejected from her 
fingertip, in the form of a energy beam. The beam and the Thunder Shot 
struck each other instantly, blowing up on contact with each other. The 
impact was closer to Diana than anyone else, so she automatically 
brought her invisible magical defences to protect herself the dust and 
stray energy. During that explosion, Rainhande leapt over in the path 
between Saizaki and Diana, bringing his sword back up in readiness. 

&quot;Lieutenant,&quot; Rainhande said commandingly. &quot;...Still alive?&quot;

Saizaki groaned, then rolled over to grab the Fire Cutter. In an instant 
he was back on his feet, the soldier resumed a fighting stance and 
stared down Diana. &quot;...Guess so, Captain.&quot; 

Diana ran a hand through her silvery-blonde hair. &quot;Well, well, well. So 
two of the three who are wielding the remaining swords are here, eh? And 
I suppose I can assume that the third sword-wielder is somewhere out in 
this battlefield. The Order of Light must be desperate if they are 
willing to throw this kind of force at us for a simple siege of a town.&quot;

Saizaki whispered to Rainhande whilst watching Diana. &quot;Got any bright 
ideas, wonderboy?&quot; 

The Captain just ignored the &#39;wonderboy&#39; comment. &quot;... She is a 
magic-user. Their powers have to be focused on one person for their 
spells to have the greatest effects. I assume that this is the reason 
she attempted to isolate you from the rest of the Special Mission 
Corps.&quot;

Saizaki felt himself getting angrier. &quot;And how the fuck is that 
relevant?&quot;

&quot;To put it simply,&quot; Rainhande stepped forwards a tad. &quot;Her concentration 
will be weaker if she fights the two of us at the same time. If we 
combine our forces we can-&quot; 

&quot;Diana?!&quot;

Rainhande did not get the chance to finish what he was trying to say. A 
fourth voice came from the right, and the two soldiers looked over at 
the trench that had been created by Diana&#39;s Pulsation attack. It was 
Aarin, with a vacant, haunted expression on his face. This seemed to be 
being brought on by seeing Diana. Diana looked over to the Commander of 
Order of Light. She hadn&#39;t seen him in years. And to see him now...

Diana smiled innocently, though it looked tyrannical with all the 
bloodshed and misery that was surrounding them. &quot;So it is you. Aarin 
Highland. Still alive, I see.&quot;

Aarin&#39;s breath quivered. &quot;It cannot be... you haven&#39;t aged at all...&quot;

&quot;And you have grown old,&quot; Diana mocked him. &quot;At last, Karma makes its 
mark. This situation has come full circle I only wish Setsuya were here 
so I could author my revenge upon him as well as you.&quot;

&quot;Setsuya committed no crime.&quot; Aarin claimed, shaking his head. 

&quot;He killed the man I loved!&quot; For the first time, Miss Angelinous lost 
her control. The ground began to shake underneath them as Diana 
unleashed her rage. Rage that she had been holding back ever since the 
death of Zephaniah. 

Aarin drew up his sword, but did not attack. &quot;Zephaniah would have been 
stopped at some point, Diana! Such was the position he was setting 
himself in! Setsuya&#39;s intention was never to kill him! He just wanted to 
re-claim the girl that Zephaniah had kidnapped in his plan to lure out 
the sacred swords! You must believe this!&quot; 

Anger was her belief. &quot;I will hear none of your excuses, Highland!&quot;

Diana growled, and pulled up her hand, to strike. Energy began to gather 
at that hand, the summoning of magic. Seconds later a ball of white 
streaming fire was blasted from it. Aarin gathered his impetus and 
vaulted in the air, clear over the blast. It whizzed along till it 
killed a random soldier on the other side of the battlefield. But Diana 
didn&#39;t give a damn. It could have been an enemy soldier, could have been 
one of her own, it was irrelevant in her mind. All that mattered to her 
now was avenging her beloved. Aarin landed just in front of Saizaki and 
Rainhande, in a defensive stance.

He whispered to the two of them, &quot;Retreat.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Saizaki exclaimed. 

Aarin watched Diana, but responded. &quot;Gather up the remaining soldiers 
and retreat. They will not follow us to until they are better prepared. 
And though we may have the upper hand now... Diana could change that all 
in a heartbeat. I shall handle her myself, while you two retreat with 
the able-bodied We cannot allow Diana to seize your swords. At any 
cost.&quot;

Saizaki groaned again. &quot;Oh come on, Commander! We can&#39;t punk out now!&quot;

It was then that Rainhande agreed. &quot;No. He is right. We were not 
prepared for this &#39;Diana&#39; woman. He have been outwitted If this battle 
is to fail, we have to do what we can to minimize the collective 
fallout. We should retreat now.&quot;

Saizaki didn&#39;t agree at first. But the idea that this battle might be a 
losing one struck home. And Lilia was somewhere in the thicket of all 
that fighting He couldn&#39;t allow her to be killed in this place if they 
weren&#39;t even going to win. So Saizaki said nothing in protest and just 
nodded in cooperation with Rainhande. The Neo-German Captain nodded, and 
the two lads ran out into the battle ground to spread the word of 
retreat. Leaving Aarin behind with Diana. The two watched each other as 
they had done 66 years ago In the murky ruins of Neuschwanstein Castle. 
At that darkly sacrosanct event which was known to the many as the 
Ten-sekai sentou kyousou... 

&quot;Diana... this is wrong...&quot; Aarin had matured much since then. &quot;I bore 
no resentment to you back then. In fact, when I saw you; I was 
bewitched. By your strength and beauty, your courage and fire. And most 
of all your caring nature. It makes me sad to see your heart suffer like 
this... I know that vengeance is not who you are.&quot;

Diana lowered her eyes. &quot;...This world violates people like us, Aarin 
People who are gifted. It turns us against each other. If not for the 
World Federation and their romance with the Safe Zones, this war would 
have never taken place. The thousands who have died would have lived to 
see other days.&quot;

&quot;So why fight in this war?&quot; Aarin asked sharply.   

&quot;I side with Al Gul Jehed because he does not stop me from being who I 
am. When magic was prohibited from use in the Safe Zones, people of my 
kind were feared and persecuted for their gifts. Treated like dogs! Just 
like I was in my youth! When they are under the control of the World 
Federation, the Safe Zones do nothing but constrict life. And the World 
Federation uses them to absorb all that is pure from the world. They 
hide behind truth and honour! These are nothing but guises! And they 
corrupted my love with their greed! They made me loose all faith in what 
is left of this ruined world!&quot;

Diana spread her arms out as she continued. &quot;Look at this desecrated 
planet! A mere carcass of its former self! And we fight over it like 
rabid dogs brawling for a decaying bone! I have no kindness left in me 
because I am trapped in this disgusting reality! All I feel is pain, all 
I see is sadness. There is nothing left of this world to love. The only 
thing I cared about in this earth was Zephaniah And he was taken from me 
by you and Setsuya! The only man I ever loved! And the only way I can 
see to cure my heartbreak... is to revenge myself upon you and the 
descendant of Setsuya. It is all I have left... the last narcotic to 
keep me from the brink of madness...&quot;

It broke Aarin&#39;s heart see a once kind woman fall into disillusion like 
this. &quot;I truly am sorry for you, Diana. This world has polluted your 
life countless times. But I am firmly committed to ending this war once 
and for all.&quot;

Diana&#39;s beautiful, pain-filled eyes narrowed out at him. &quot;Then do as you 
must, Aarin.&quot;

That he would Though he truly held no hatred for her, Aarin would have 
to do all in his power to keep the swords from falling into the hands of 
the enemy. The old master gripped the Double Cleaver&#39;s hilt with both 
hands. In a firm hold. He held the sword in front of him, the edge 
running parallel with his face. Aarin then drew in breath, released it, 
and his body reacted. His aged, weakening muscles suddenly bulged from 
underneath the fabric of his uniform. Diana watched intently This was 
not magic. This was the natural flow of a strong warrior&#39;s Chi, being 
implanted inside his muscles.  Aarin stamped his foot into the ground, 
growling with a deep rustle in his throat. His muscles continued to 
expand until they reached and inner limit. And it was obvious that Aarin 
had intended this.

The old master began to swing his sword around. &quot;This is it! Herald of 
the Yuuga school! Bane of that which is evil! Un-sealer of the universal 
Chi! Raaaaaagh! Plasma Sandanjuu!&quot;

As soon as the sword fell into a double-gripped position pointing at 
Diana, a stream of magnificent lavender energy burst out from the Double 
Cleaver. A huge stream of spiritual power, rivalling the strength of 
Diana&#39;s Pulsation spell. The Angelinous woman gasped at the sheer size 
of the attack, and brought up her defences Invisible shields defended 
her from the onslaught of the blast wave, energy spilling off it in 
streams. These rogues bolts blasted the ground, making it break open in 
clumps around Diana&#39;s feet. The woman gritted her teeth as she struggled 
to protect herself, while Aarin struggled to keep it up. Something had 
to give eventually. And it was Diana&#39;s magical wall. The ageless woman 
cried out as the Plasma Sandanjuu broke through her shields and struck 
her. The energy of Aarin&#39;s spirit was enormous. Such spiritual strength 
made up for the weaknesses of age. Diana was blown back from the 
unstoppable force, hurled by relentless Chi into the crowds of soldiers 
far behind her. She fell into them with a thud, their guards lowered due 
to the sudden shock of a deflected Diana. 

The energy then washed away. 

Aarin lowered his sword and gasped violently for breath. That was only 
about 40% of the Plasma Sandanjuu&#39;s ultimate power... but it was all he 
could handle at his age. Anything more than that and his heart would go 
into cardiac arrest. It had happened before. But fortunately this was 
enough to resist Diana. All he wanted to do was stun her so his troops 
could make an escape. Which was exactly what they were doing. They were 
running towards the west, in the opposite direction from the battlefield 
and Rosenheim. 

The noble old master sheathed his sword and followed them, dodging what 
few enemy soldiers were left in that part of the battlefield. The Battle 
of Rosenheim had been a failure But Aarin was not going to risk anymore 
of his men on a hopeless fight. He would simply wait for the 
repercussions.

Ones that were bound to come.
