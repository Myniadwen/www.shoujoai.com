<a href="../original/descent-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>The older man running the bar looked over at the
twitchy guy in the corner, wondering at his oddly
average appearance. Mousy brown hair, battered
overcoat and jeans, glasses gleaming as he bent over
his beer. The only odd thing was his hands, which
twitched and moved almost with a life of their own. He
looked up at the barkeep, &quot;Yes?&quot;

Fighting back his disquiet at the odd young man the
barkeep asked gruffly, &quot;That all?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; the young man took a drink, &quot;do you
remember a few weeks ago, a odd priest or her friend
causing trouble here?&quot;

&quot;You connected to them?&quot; his voice was cold, gray eyes
narrowing.

&quot;Bounty hunter,&quot; he said casually.

&quot;Yeah, that crazy priest was here once,&quot; the barkeep
admitted, &quot;busted up the place then set the bar on
fire.&quot;

&quot;On fire? A woman after my own heart,&quot; he purred,
gazing off into the distance dreamily. Shaking himself
he asked, &quot;Any idea where she is now?&quot;

&quot;Hasn&#39;t been back,&quot; the bartender said with a firm
shake of his head, &quot;and I don&#39;t want to see her again,
either.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; he got up, leaving money on the
table.

&quot;What are you...?&quot; the barkeep asked as the young man
took out from his coat four glass test tubes with two
different fluids in them. He tossed two of them
towards the occupied tables at the back, the rest up
at the main bar. The glass broke with a almost musical
sound, the chemicals mixed then there was an explosion
of fire. Flames raced fast, screams of alarm and pain
ringing out, then coolly the young man turned to go.

&quot;My name is Pyre, and I have a message for you to pass
on,&quot; he said, ignoring the mob of people who were
streaming by him out the door, &quot;tell Descent and her
priest to come out, or I&#39;ll make this city burn.&quot; And
with that he was gone too.

&quot;First that crazy priest burns my place down,&quot; the
bartender raged, &quot;now this?!&quot; Outside of the building
he collapsed on the sidewalk and groaned, &quot;What did I
do wrong?!&quot;

Over in another part of town a blonde dressed in a
schoolgirl&#39;s outfit walked along the street with a
easy air about her, window shopping. Casually she
chewed gum, then pushed the pink stuff with her tongue
to start up a bubble. Blue eyes amused she paused by
the fashion outlet, gazing at the clothes with
longing.

&quot;I still don&#39;t understand why I&#39;m here with you,
Thrillkill,&quot; the morose young woman frowned, her long
black hair falling limply around her face.

&quot;Cause I think you&#39;re interesting, Deathwish,&quot;
Thrillkill answered brightly, &quot;you&#39;re the first person
I&#39;ve met who I can kill more than once.&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Deathwish sighed. A bit crossly she
asked her companion, &quot;Are we going to start working,
soon?&quot;

&quot;I thought we were already at work?&quot; Thrillkill
smirked. They had hit two shops so far, casually
killing anyone who crossed them.

&quot;No sign of &#39;em, though,&quot; Deathwish pointed out, her
flat, dead eyes sweeping the crowd then the busy
street beyond.

Thrillkill pouted, &quot;Maybe we need to do something more
noticeable?&quot;

&quot;How about this?&quot; and after a running start Deathwish
threw herself out into the busy stream of traffic. She
hit one car, blood fountaining as he legs were broken
then bounced, flying till she hit another vehicle&#39;s
windshield, shattering it as well as her shoulder.
Blood splashing she hit the pavement a short distance
away, sending more cars careening aside.

The chain reaction crash that followed was almost
textbook. The first car tried to brake then was hit
from behind, both cars ramming into a lamppost. They
in turn stopped other cars while the vehicle with the
wrecked windshield careened up onto the sidewalk,
plowing down bystanders then crashing through a shop
window.

&quot;Cool,&quot; Thrillkill loudly popped her bubblegum as she
watched the unfolding chaos admiringly. In a few
moments Deathwish emerged from the madness, her
clothes splattered with red but fully healed from her
injuries. &quot;You know,&quot; Thrillkill looked the blood
splattered woman over, &quot;you look sort of hot like
that.&quot;

Deathwish ignored that as she frowned down at her arm,
the flesh twisted out of alignment. Grabbing her
forearm with her other hand she yanked and wrenched at
her flesh, the misaligned segments of bone grinding
eerily until they popped back into place. &quot;Do you
think that was enough?&quot; she asked flatly.

Sirens wailed off in the distance as Thrillkill
shrugged casually. &quot;If not,&quot; she said cheerfully, &quot;we
can also kill any emergency services that come, too.&quot;

&quot;Freeze!&quot; the police officer yelled, the dusky skinned
young man holding his gun at the ready. They had
rushed to the business district when a 911 call
reported a crazy man.. they hadn&#39;t expected to find
bodies slashed with knives.

The black clad young man turned, his eyes narrowing a
bit, then he seemed to merely flick his wrist. With a
painful cry the officer stumbled backward, dropping
his gun as he reached up towards his face where a
bloody knife dripped between his eyes. A second blade
to the throat cut off his gurgling cries, and after a
moment he dropped.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; a annoyed voice came from behind the black
clad man, &quot;do you have to play with them, Solitude?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Solitude flashed a grin, &quot;otherwise it&#39;s no
fun, Sister.&quot;

Sister Rosette sniffed loudly, her red hair flowing
around her pretty face, her black and white nun&#39;s
habit giving her a reserved look. &quot;God won&#39;t forgive
you this,&quot; she said flatly, reaching up to
thoughtfully finger her rosary.

&quot;God and I haven&#39;t talked in years,&quot; Solitude answered
dryly.

Sister Rosette gave him a dangerous look as she
hissed, &quot;I&#39;ll deal with you after we&#39;ve found the
other unbelievers.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to see you try,&quot; Solitude laughed, reaching
out to slap her ass.

Rosette moved like a shot, wheeling around to knee him
right in the balls. As Solitude was gasping painfully
she slipped her rosary free from around her neck,
whipping the white beads across his face and making
him cry out in surprise as the weighted length struck.

&quot;Crazy bitch,&quot; Solitude cursed in pain, staggering.

&quot;I&#39;m a bride of GOD,&quot; Rosette growled as she whipped
the beads hard across his face again, staggering him
once more. &quot;Repent!&quot;

&quot;What the hell...&quot; Solitude moaned weakly, shocked and
confused by the sudden violence.

&quot;GOD may forgive you,&quot; gracefully Rosette pulled the
rosary around his neck then tightened it, exposing the
razor wire hidden beneath the metal beads, &quot;but I
won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Solitude reached up as he felt the wire cutting
into his flesh, slicing his fingers as he tried to get
free, blood pouring down his black clothes.

With a final twist of her arms Rosette finished,
watching the man&#39;s head roll free as the body dropped,
still twitching faintly, to the dirty ground. With an
odd kind of serenity Rosette kneeled down beside him,
clasped her hands and began to pray softly.

From the shadows Aileen watched the young woman going
through her after kill rituals, then the redheaded
killer walked away. Talking softly into a mic. mounted
on her collar she asked, &quot;Cathy, I thought you told me
her prescription to the anti-psychotics was up to
date?&quot;

&quot;Her prescription might be up to date but she&#39;s
obviously not taking them,&quot; Cathy replied dryly. &quot;What
do you want to do?&quot;

&quot;I think,&quot; Aileen turned to see Rosette dabbing her
fingers in the pool of blood then crossing herself
formally, &quot;we&#39;ll send her after the others... she only
kills sinners.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Cathy sounded dubious, &quot;but she considers you
a sinner, too.&quot;

&quot;I can handle her if needed,&quot; Aileen smiled
dangerously.

&quot;I&#39;ve heard that before,&quot; Cathy grumbled.</pre>
