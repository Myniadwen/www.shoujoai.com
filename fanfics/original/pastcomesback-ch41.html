<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 41 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch40.html">Back to Part 40</a><pre>      When Krystal was heading back to Hoshi, she noticed that Isaka had fallen asleep in 
the hallway. She set down the plate with the sandwich and the glass of water down before 
examining her girlfriend. It made sense - Isaka was probably exhausted from everything. She 
lovingly stroked her brown hair before giving her a chaste kiss on the lips.

      As she got up, she figured Isaka must be really tired to not awaken at the touch of 
her lips... Krystal opened the door to Hoshi&#39;s room and was greeted with the sight of the 
woman staring at the ceiling. She sat up as Krystal approached and took the plate.

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered as she bit in. Krystal only watched as the tears began to 
stream down her cheeks. &quot;It&#39;s delicious,&quot; she sobbed.

      Krystal sat down on the bed as Hoshi continued. &quot;What am I going to do? How can I face 
them? I was supposed to protect them and treat them well and make sure they found nice boys 
to settle down with and have a family, yet I... yet I ruined it all. All of it was my fault! 
The Demon Lord... if I hadn&#39;t of been so self absorbed in my impure thoughts than we would 
have been able to kill him and seal him away all those years ago... then everything...&quot;

      &quot;Hoshi... if you stay fixated on the past, nothing is ever going to change-&quot;

      &quot;I know, you just don&#39;t understand,&quot; Hoshi screeched out. &quot;I&#39;m not like you, I&#39;m not a 
saint, I can&#39;t do it! I can&#39;t... just... I can&#39;t just lie and say it wasn&#39;t me, because it 
was all me when I touched my sisters and it was all I ever wanted.&quot;

      &quot;Then don&#39;t lie,&quot; Krystal suddenly shouted, louder than she meant to. &quot;You&#39;re sitting 
here, talking about how you need to be honest, but you&#39;re still hiding. A... an infection 
doesn&#39;t get better by covering it up. You have to cut it open, expose it and clean it before 
it heals.&quot;

      &quot;...but it will still leave a scar, won&#39;t it?&quot; Hoshi avoided Krystal&#39;s annoyed gaze. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just terrified because the girls I love more than myself hate me.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s not true,&quot; Krystal said, her voice becoming softer. &quot;Hina was asking to come 
see you. Tsuki seemed reluctant because I think she has a clue, but if you talk to them...&quot;

      Hoshi began to eat her sandwich again. &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; she whispered out. &quot;Tomorrow I will 
have to face up to everything...&quot; 

***** 

      Just as Abby and Eveon were setting down platters of food on the table, Tsuru came 
into the dining room, trying to brush off Carmilla. &quot;Really, I thought you said you weren&#39;t 
going to cling to me...!&quot;

      &quot;This isn&#39;t clinging,&quot; Carmilla whispered out. &quot;It&#39;s cuddling.&quot;

      At that moment the two women caught the eye of the two sisters. Hina and Tsuki 
exchanged awkward glances before getting up from their seats.

      &quot;We&#39;re so sorry,&quot; Tsuki started.

      &quot;We never meant to be so horrible!&quot;

      Carmilla froze and glared at them. &quot;Ah, it&#39;s the little devils... you nearly starved 
me to death when you made me your little shadow beast factory!&quot;

      Tsuki cringed. &quot;We... we really do feel bad, so if there&#39;s anything we can do to make 
it up to you...!&quot;

      Carmilla let out a sigh before a great idea popped into her head. &quot;Actually... I know 
a great way for you to make it up to me.&quot;

      &quot;Really?&quot; Hina said, happy to find a way to be forgiven. That is... until the vampire 
grabbed her by the shoulders and sunk her fangs into her neck.

      The blonde&#39;s cry of surprise caused everyone to cringe and Eveon to immediately excuse 
herself back into the kitchen to check on the pasta. Carmilla took a single gulp before 
letting go. Hina struggled to stay on her feet, but Tsuki caught her and set her down in the 
chair.

      &quot;Hina, are you alright?&quot; The brunette asked her sister. She only gave a dazed nod, 
holding a hand to her neck. It was then that Tsuki felt the stare of the vampire upon her 
own neck.

      She turned hesitantly to see Tsuru looking quite shocked at Carmilla&#39;s aggressiveness 
and the vampire herself wiping her lips with a single finger. &quot;Hmm,&quot; the blue haired woman 
said. &quot;Hina&#39;s a nice, light taste... very... I dunno, it&#39;s very nice... I wonder how you 
taste?&quot;

      Tsuki racked her brain for some kind of excuse but it didn&#39;t take long for Carmilla to 
taste her as well. The brunette plopped down next to her sister, just as stunned at the lack 
of blood. &quot;My, you&#39;re taste is nice and robust... it&#39;s a lot different, but just as good,&quot; 
the vampire said, as though discussing the intricacies of wine rather than blood.

      Tsuru went over to the two girls. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

      &quot;Oh, it&#39;s okay, master,&quot; Hina said. &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

      Tsuru tensed up. &quot;M-master...?&quot;

      The blonde gave her a confused look. &quot;Oh... I guess even though the curse is gone I 
still think of you that way.&quot; She started giggling. &quot;How weird, huh Tsuki?&quot;

      Her sister laughed as well. &quot;At least Tsuru is a kind master.&quot;

      &quot;D-don&#39;t call me that! You aren&#39;t my servants - we&#39;re equals.&quot;

      Hina pouted and exchanged looks with Tsuki. &quot;If master isn&#39;t the good,&quot; the young girl 
started...  &quot;How about mistress instead?&quot;

      Tsuru turned bright red and felt the jealous glare of Carmilla permeate the room. 
Tsuki joined in as well. &quot;I suppose mistress would technically be better. Tsuru is the one 
whose going to take care of us, right?&quot; The brunette asked with a bit of uncertainty.

      Tsuru let out a sigh. &quot;That&#39;s true... I will be taking care of you guys...&quot;

      &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

      The question came from Tycara. Tsuru nearly forgot they had an audience at the table. 
&quot;Oh well... they&#39;re obviously in no shape to assimilate back into a normal life so I&#39;m 
probably going to stay with them at the shrine so all of us can train. It seems only 
appropriate.&quot;

      Carmilla, however, was still in one of her moods. &quot;Mistress?&quot; She asked Tsuru.

      &quot;I-I...&quot; The ebony haired woman tried to dodge the question as everyone else continued 
eating what had been brought out.

      Mina looked around. &quot;Where&#39;s Erin and Faye?&quot;

      Abby, who had been setting out a salad, let out a slight laugh. &quot;Why eat dinner when 
you can just have each other?&quot;

      Seth just covered his face in embarrassment of having to hear such a joke and thinking 
that was probably what Bakra and Josh were doing as well. The two sisters flushed a bright 
red as Mina just tried to pretend nothing happened by eating her mashed potatoes. Tycara 
looked around, missing the double entendre. &quot;...but why would Faye and Erin want to eat each 
other...?&quot;

      Sakura tilted her head. &quot;I guess... that would be a good idea for... dessert...&quot;

      Abby almost dropped her salad bowl at the look Sakura was giving her. &quot;You... you 
really need to stop hanging around Isaka and Faye.&quot;

      Mina let out a laugh. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s because she spends so much time with you.&quot;

      Abby scoffed. &quot;Whatever, bondage queen.&quot;

      Mina started reddening with anger. &quot;Hey! Just because my mom reads my diary and shares 
it with you whenever you come over for coffee doesn&#39;t mean you have to go shouting that 
stuff out to the world!&quot;

      Abby just smiled at getting back at the girl. &quot;Please - I have the safety of my 
daughter to worry about.&quot;

      Hina and Tsuki exchanged looks. &quot;Even... even we never did that kind of stuff with big 
sister,&quot; Hina murmured.

      Tsuki just shook her head. &quot;Please, let&#39;s not talk about that right now...&quot;

      Hina peered over at her sister. &quot;...are you ashamed?&quot;

      Tsuki just nodded. &quot;I&#39;m ashamed of my traitorous body.&quot; She let out a bitter laugh. 
&quot;Big sister was right about me always being trouble... I was the first to fall and the first 
to disobey and the first to be free.&quot;

      Hina pursed her lips in thought. &quot;Hmm... but I&#39;m sure everything will be okay now, 
right?&quot;

      Her sister didn&#39;t react. &quot;Hina, let&#39;s eat.&quot;

      &quot;So,&quot; Tsuru said suddenly, finding a way to distract Carmilla. &quot;You aren&#39;t killing 
people anymore?&quot;

      The vampire laughed, forgetting her earlier bad mood. &quot;No, not since I started chasing 
you. I knew you&#39;d be upset. Now I just take little sips as often as I can instead of gorging 
on one person every once in a while...&quot; She absently put a hand on her stomach. &quot;But I&#39;m 
still hungry...&quot;

      She gave Tsuru a searing look and the Demon Lord knew exactly what she was asking. She 
let out another long sigh of defeat and looked away. &quot;Uh... I guess you can drink mine...&quot; 
Carmilla almost immediately pounced on her.

      &quot;Oh, thank you!&quot; Tsuru started to figure that it was a bad idea seeing how Carmilla 
was giving her neck open mouthed kisses instead of biting.

      Seth turned away from the scene as her pierced a piece of lettuce with his fork. &quot;If I 
were a more perverted man...&quot; he murmured. &quot;I would be very happy right now... talk about 
dinner and a show.&quot;

      Carmilla finally bit in and after only a second, she pulled away with a stunned gasp. 
Tsuru watched in surprise as the vampire grimaced and put a hand over her mouth. Tears were 
springing to her eyes as she let out a girly moan.

      &quot;Tsu... Tsuru!&quot; The vampire wailed. &quot;You taste... you taste disgusting!&quot;

      Everyone at the table was stunned as the vampire continued lamenting. &quot;This is 
terrible! I chased you for so long with the hope that I could feed off your blood so you 
wouldn&#39;t get jealous of me biting other girls... but your blood is absolutely repulsive!&quot; 
The vampire cried out, heading towards the kitchen.

      &quot;Eveon!&quot; She called as she entered. &quot;Please! I need your blood to wash my mouth out!&quot;

      &quot;Oh, hell no!&quot; The young girl said, running around the other side of the counter. 
&quot;Just use water!&quot;

      &quot;But the taste won&#39;t go away,&quot; Carmilla moaned. &quot;I need to taste something yummy 
instead.&quot;

      The fork in Tsuki&#39;s hand dropped as everyone at the table heard the signature sound of 
Eveon scream from getting bitten. Mina immediately raced into the kitchen. &quot;Ugh, you nasty 
vampire! Stay away from my girlfriend!&quot;

      Tsuru sat down, rubbing her neck. &quot;I wonder... if I should feel this offended...&quot;

      Sakura spoke up. &quot;Carmilla... likes human virgin girl blood... and considering you&#39;re 
none of those except for the female part... it&#39;s probably disgusting.&quot;

      Tsuru sunk down deeper into a chair. For a beautiful angel, Sakura could be pretty 
damn blunt... 

***** 

      &quot;I must say... that was a tricky little plan you pulled,&quot; Bakra said looking over at 
Tsuru. It was now later in the evening and the demon was eating some of the leftovers 
reserved for the people too busy with each other to come to dinner.

      The Demon Lord was currently in the dining room to stave off having to deal with 
Carmilla. &quot;I know. I wasn&#39;t sure if it would actually work and I almost messed up by 
underestimating the power sealed in that pit...&quot; She took a drink from her glass of water. 
&quot;By the way, where&#39;s Josh?&quot;

      Bakra let out a slight laugh. &quot;He&#39;s dead tired from using all his holy energy.&quot; Tsuru 
rolled her eyes, thinking there was something else behind it, but she didn&#39;t say anything. 
&quot;Why couldn&#39;t you have told us what you were doing?&quot;

      &quot;Well, I was being watched. While I&#39;m now the greatest embodiment of dark power, it 
doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m completely in control. That thing that was sealed up could see everything I 
was doing so I didn&#39;t have a chance to tell anyone except Krystal right before we broke the 
seal.&quot;

      Bakra shoveled some more food down his throat before thinking. &quot;Yeah, but somebody 
must have noticed what was going on. I&#39;m surprised that no one was sent after you, like 
angels or some kind of army of peace keepers, you know?&quot;

      Tsuru frowned. &quot;That bothered me too... so I guess whoever is in charge of keeping the 
world order was using you guys as bait. I suspect that if we&#39;d all been taken over by dark 
power inside the pit, there would have been a standing army right outside to defeat us.&quot;

      Bakra still didn&#39;t look too pleased. &quot;It shouldn&#39;t be our responsibility for this kind 
of stuff. I overheard Sakura freaking out a bit over how they hadn&#39;t found a replacement for 
the Living Inferno or just... how they didn&#39;t send some kind of agent or something.&quot;

      Tsuru shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m not going to worry about it. The last thing I want to do is try 
to wrap my head around all the stuff that happens behind the scenes. Sakura is supposed to 
be under oath to not speak of those things us earth dwellers shouldn&#39;t know. We may be 
demons and angels and everything in between, but we&#39;re all really human.&quot;

      He let out a slight laugh and leaned against his chair. &quot;I know, I know. I&#39;m just 
worried.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s odd, isn&#39;t it? In the public, this is simply a world filled with humans - yet we 
exist in a secondary secrecy where there are demons living perfectly among the humans. Then 
there&#39;s a third layer of Heaven&#39;s Gate - the name of the secret place of angels. Finally... 
there&#39;s everything else we don&#39;t even know about,&quot; Tsuru muttered, crossing her arms. &quot;I 
just hope being the new Demon Lord doesn&#39;t mean I have to take on responsibilities.&quot;

      Bakra sighed and started on his apple pie. &quot;I guess it is a lot to think about. Wanna 
split this with me?&quot;
