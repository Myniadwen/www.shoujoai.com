<a href="../original/dreamday-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Since the night of that first kiss Kris and Jennifer peacefully slept in 
the same bed every weekend. Kris felt safe in the girl&#39;s arms; it was 
like the monsters of the night couldn&#39;t harm her as long she could feel 
her friend next to her. Kris would curl up close to the girl&#39;s body and 
fall asleep with her head on Jennifer&#39;s shoulder. She would drift to 
sleep while breathing in the scent of her hair. She enjoyed that scent, 
it had a soothing quality to it that put Kris&#39;s mind at ease. They slept 
like this for several years and Kris wished that they could stay in each 
others arms for ever. 

One such night Kris felt something brush against her face, and she 
cautiously opened her eyes to see Jennifer leaning over her. Her hand 
reached out to softly stroked Kris&#39;s cheek and there was a look in 
Jennifer&#39;s eyes which struggled with some kind of inner pain that Kris 
could not comprehend. 

Kris had a peek at the clock and noticed that it was only slightly past 
1 am. Jennifer&#39;s mother was probably fast asleep on the floor above 
them. She pulled herself up to sit against the headboard, forcing 
Jennifer to move back a little, &quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; Kris 
whispered in the night, afraid of the way her voice echoed in the 
silence. 

Jennifer crossed her legs under her nightgown and leaned against the 
wall. Kris personally got Jenn that nightgown for the girl&#39;s 14th 
birthday and Jenn wore it every night that the girls spent together. 
Jenn pulled at the fabric and licked at her lips, &quot;I was just thinking,&quot; 
She said resting her head against the wall behind her and looking at the 
ceiling. 

Kris scooted closer while curling her legs beside herself. She placed 
her hand next to Jenn so she could pull herself even closer. Tilting her 
head to one side Kris blinked at the girl. &quot;Thinking?&quot; She murmured 
intrigued. 

Jennifer rolled her head on the wall until she was looking at Kris. 
Light from a house across the way washed over her pale face and Kris 
could see her friend was seriously troubled by something. Jenn&#39;s eyes 
darted around as she tried to find her voice, &quot;I just... I...&quot; She 
stammered trying to form her pain into words. 

Kris reached out and brushed a lock of hair out of Jennifer&#39;s eyes. She 
could see her friend shiver against her touch. Kris went to pull away 
when Jennifer took her hand and rubbed it against her cheek. Kris sat 
still, not knowing what to do. In the past years that she had known this 
girl the most they had done was innocently hug and kiss each other. 
However right now, as Jennifer caressed her hand, something overwhelmed 
her like nothing had before. A shiver that started deep within her and 
washed over her entire self. Their eyes met and Kris had to swallow 
hard. She felt something tug at her heart and she was frightened by what 
it wanted. She craved to touch Jennifer more, not just holding her hand 
or a simple kiss. Caress her everywhere. Thoughts rushed through her 
mind that she never fully understood. It made no sense to her why every 
time Jenn got near her that she wanted to pet the girl. Desired to be 
more intimate to her than ever before  

Earlier that week they were sitting together in Sexual Education Class 
and were each given a pamphlet to take home with them. While Kris simply 
turned the paper down. Jennifer took one of the pamphlets with her and 
read it on the way home that day. The whole thing made Kris nervous, 
nevertheless Jennifer seemed more intrigued than anything else. She read 
to Kris, in awe and amazement, a list on how girls masturbate. Kris felt 
herself blush many shades of red listening to her friend talk about the 
subject. It was not like Kris didn&#39;t know about those things. Her father 
taught her more then she wanted to know about the subject. For some 
reason the thought of Jenn masturbating made Kris&#39;s heart flutter all 
the faster. Now here they sat in the darkness and Kris started to be 
overrun by fear. She wanted to run, wanted to hide, but couldn&#39;t take 
her eyes off of
Jennifer as she softly kissed the back of Kris&#39;s hand. 

&quot;Umm... Je.. Jenn...&quot; Kris stammered not to sure if she liked the way 
things were going. Her heart was pounding so hard she was afraid that 
she would wake up Jenn&#39;s mother.

Almost as if Jennifer wasn&#39;t aware of what she was doing, she looked at 
Kris&#39;s hand and suddenly let go, &quot;I... I...&quot; She began to rub her head 
and eyes in frustration. Tear were forming in the girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry... I didn&#39;t...&quot;

Kris&#39;s fear was replaced by distress. She pulled herself to the girl&#39;s 
side and tentatively touched her friend&#39;s hand. Jennifer looked up at 
Kris, her lips quivered and she seemed as fragile as glass. Kris didn&#39;t 
know what came over her and she took the girl&#39;s cheek in her hand and 
looked her in the eyes. Kris&#39;s breathing quickened and her heart raced. 
She leaned in close and let their foreheads meet, not letting her eyes 
off of Jennifer&#39;s. Kris finally understood what was behind those eyes. 
She understood the pain her friend was experiencing because it was 
welling up inside of her at that moment. She took a deep breath and when 
she finally spoke her voice was but a mere whisper. &quot;Do you want to?&quot; 
was all she could muster. Kris could sense that the girl was as afraid 
of her own feelings as Kris was, maybe even more. 

Jennifer closed her eyes, licked her lips and swallowed hard, then when 
she opened them again she forced a tiny smile and nodded her head 
slowly. Kris placed an arm around the girl and slowly tilted backwards 
until they were laying down again. Jennifer eyed the girl that she had 
become to love and for the first time really kissed her. It didn&#39;t 
resemble the soft kisses they had given each other frequently over the 
years. This time it was a long deep kiss. A kiss that made Kris savor a
rush of warmth run through her body. 

Kris felt a shiver run through her as Jenn&#39;s fingers ran under her 
pyjama top along her side. Her body froze as they moved along her rib 
cage up to her small breasts. Jennifer stopped and sat up on Kris&#39;s lap, 
&quot;Are you sure?&quot; She asked, unease could be heard in her voice. Kris 
realized that this girl would not purposely harm her, never treat her 
like an object. Jenn really loved Kris as much as Kris loved her. To 
show how much Kris trusted the girl she started to shakily unbutton her 
top from the bottom up. 

Jennifer bit her bottom lip as she watched the buttons come undone one 
by one. No matter how much Kris complained about how thin and boyish she 
appeared Jennifer would always reply by telling her how cute she looked. 
Almost to reassure Kris&#39;s feelings she leaned forward and slowly kissed 
the girl&#39;s now exposed tummy. Kris became aware that her back arched as 
soft lips tickled her skin. Jennifer sat up again and smiled down at 
Kris who&#39;s entire body flushed bright red. Kris lay still for a moment 
with her eyes shut, trying to catch her breath. She opened her eyes to 
see Jennifer strip off her nightgown. The streetlight made the girl&#39;s 
skin almost glow in the night as she sat in nothing, but her white 
panties. Kris stared up at the girl like she was some kind of angel. 
Jennifer blushed at the way Kris observed her and tried to cover her 
chest. 

Kris reached out and ran a hand through soft strains of hair. Jennifer 
rolled to Kris&#39;s side and pulled the covers over them, almost as if she 
was trying to hide from whomever might be looking. Kris could feel the 
girl&#39;s soft skin press against her&#39;s as Jennifer buried her face into 
Kris&#39;s short hair. The two explored each other&#39;s bodies with their 
fingertips, listening carefully to what made the other softly squirm in 
the right way or caused them to cry out. 

Kris began to feel more at ease with Jennifer&#39;s petting. Even enjoyed 
the way it caused her body to turn to goose bumps when she traced along 
the bottom of her breasts. Just as Kris was beginning to relax more she 
notuced the girl&#39;s hand slip into her pyjama bottoms. She felt herself 
hold her breath as Jenn&#39;s fingers lightly traced along her small thighs. 
Kris rubbed her head against Jennifer and felt herself purr. For the 
first time she was actually enjoying being held and cuddled. She wanted 
to tell Jennifer not to ever stop until she sensed fingers  brush 
against her panty line. Her breath suddenly got caught in her throat as 
she tried to find her voice to put a stop to what she knew was about to 
happen. She didn&#39;t like being touched there, even so whenever someone 
did she lost all control of her body and would freeze in place. She 
disliked how that made her feel trapped, she didn&#39;t want Jennifer to 
stop caressing her, but she just didn&#39;t want to be touched there. She 
squeezed her eyes shut making a silent wish for Jenn to stop. 

Almost as if Jenn could hear Kris&#39;s silent words her hands stopped, but 
didn&#39;t retreat. Kris slowly opened her eyes and looked up at the girl. 
Jenn noticed the scared look in Kris&#39;s eyes. They almost pleaded her to 
stop. Jenn leaned over and kissed the girl softly. Kris felt another 
rush of heat run though her body. Again the fear was overcome by 
pleasure and Kris started to breath again. Jennifer looked the girl in 
the eyes and was about to say something when she sensed a hand trace 
circles down her spine. Jenn closed her eyes and enjoyed the sensation. 
She moved down and kissed Kris on the nipple. Kris squirmed, but did not 
pull away. She suddenly became hot all over, then Jennifer&#39;s hand slip 
under her panties and gently petted her. For a moment she didn&#39;t know 
what happened. She enjoyed the feeling of Jenn&#39;s fingers as they ran 
softly against her pubic hairs. Jenn then moved her fingers inside of 
the girl. Kris prepared herself for the pain that usually follows, 
however Jennifer was gentle. Kris tasted a flood of pleasure as the girl 
moved her fingers inside of her. She panted heavily as Jenn&#39;s fingers 
worked their way deeper. Kris felt the last of her fears melt away and 
she rolled over on top of Jennifer and kissed her deeply. For the first 
time Kris made love. The experience changed her perception on sex in 
general. She never wanted to be apart from Jennifer. She wished that 
this moment could last forever. For the first time ever Kris would wake 
up fully rested. Without a care in the world.
