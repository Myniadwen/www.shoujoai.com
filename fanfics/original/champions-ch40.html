Ashes of Loss

Sarah and Joyce stood together outside MERCS headquarters, awaiting news 
of their comrade&#39;s return. The two were interacting well despite the 
&quot;misunderstanding&quot; that arose from Sarah&#39;s first appearance, and were 
now inseparable. It seemed they both liked being alone, or at least away 
from all the others, having barely spoken to anyone unless it was 
necessary. This was understandable, since both girls had frightening 
powers that had isolated them from everyone else, even the kindest or 
most understanding soul&#151;and yet here they were, together, holding hands, 
awaiting the arrival of the few people they were comfortable with 
calling friends. They noticed two vehicles coming instead of one, but 
merely assumed that more people were needed for this trip.

Only four people came out of the vehicles: Xianq, Kailin, Sanaa, and 
Marissa, each looking as gloomy as the last. Their very bodies seemed 
dark and burdened by some great sadness; it was all they could do to 
limp out, shuffle aimlessly, and stare ahead, their eyes ghastly. They 
looked like they had peeked into some hellish abyss, their minds 
subsequently warped and their souls wrung dry. Joyce chewed her lip 
anxiously as she noticed that Aura was not among them, and stepped 
forward with a concerned face.

&quot;What happened?&quot; she asked. None of the four older girls looked like 
they had the strength to say. Their combined despondency was 
contagious&#151;soon the younger girls felt it as well. Finally Sanaa, the 
eldest in the group, managed to speak, though her voice was hardly 
there.

&quot;Get everyone together, would you? We have some awful news, and I don&#39;t 
want to repeat it more than necessary.&quot; Her brown eyes offered a further 
look into her soul&#39;s darkness; their stare alone was enough to convince 
the young girls that things really were serious. They ran off, and 
together, gathered everyone inside, even Dr. Kamaguchi and Pandora, who 
had isolated themselves from the others. Those who knew the four 
returning women well enough could tell that only a catastrophe would 
make them so distraught, so defeated, so hopeless in their agony. It 
took them awhile just to deliver said news; the reaction was just as 
they expected.

&quot;Aura Valeria...is dead.&quot;

Gasps. Murmurs of denial. Some wailing. One person cried. Another 
growled. Some merely shook their heads, unable to believe it. Others 
were silent, contemplative, their faces like stone. Nobody took the news 
well, not even Kamaguchi, who was the first to really speak.

&quot;That is a shame,&quot; she said. &quot;How did this happen? Weren&#39;t you all with 
her?&quot;

&quot;There was nothing we could&#39;ve done,&quot; said Xianq, her perky voice now 
dead. &quot;She was...taken from us by somebody&#151;that man that came here 
looking for help. His name was Darred the Numb-Mind, and he was one of 
the Dead Zodiac.&quot; Those that knew that title turned pale from shock, or 
else red with anger, or green from sickness. Marissa then recalled the 
events that had happened, in a chillingly monotone voice, straining her 
emotions near the conclusion.

&quot;We were apparently deceived by some form of strong mind control,&quot; added 
Xianq, &quot;hence his name, I suppose. I was asked...to string dynamite 
around the building, and Kailin was asked to light the fuse. I didn&#39;t 
even know I was doing it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare tell them what I did!&quot; barked Hsu angrily. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
dare! It&#39;s my fault she&#39;s gone! If I hadn&#39;t been there, she might still 
be alive!&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t say that for certain,&quot; Xianq told her, but the younger girl 
was stubborn, enraged, and inconsolable.

&quot;But I was the one responsible for her death! If I hadn&#39;t been tricked 
into using my powers, she&#39;d still be alive! Don&#39;t you get it? I&#39;m 
cursed!! I&#39;m just a stupid cursed fool! I hate myself! I hate my powers! 
I&#39;m never going to use them again, never! I&#39;m not going to be 
responsible for any more losses&#151;NO!!!&quot; Before anyone could even approach 
her, she lashed out at them, eyes burning with self-hatred. Again and 
again she denied the world hr abilities, even her own sense of value, 
and cursed herself and her family and her teacher and anyone else that 
had encouraged her, even Rin.

&quot;Just stay away from me, all of you!&quot; she roared. Bubblegum Black 
finally had enough, and slapped Kailin across the face, making a small 
hand-shaped red welt on her cheek. The snapping sound was loud enough to 
be heard by everyone; they winced.

&quot;Do you think you&#39;re the only one who&#39;s in pain?! Just look around you! 
Everyone here&#39;s affected! Aura brought us all good fortune&#151;no, she 
brought us good friendship! Everyone here is just as sad and angry as 
you are, Kailin! How do you think I feel?! She was my best friend! I was 
there too, I saw it happen&#151;I had a hand in it, for heaven&#39;s sake! Don&#39;t 
close yourself in a sphere of misery without acknowledging how others 
feel! Don&#39;t be so selfish!&quot; Bubblegum Black and Kailin glared at each 
other, both at their wit&#39;s end, both ready to break down into pieces. 
Kailin sniffled, and her eyes started to leak tears. She excused herself 
silently and went to her room; Rin sighed.

&quot;Damn,&quot; she snorted, &quot;just one thing after another. I better go talk to 
her.&quot;

&quot;May I go instead?&quot; asked Kathy, holding the older girl back. &quot;I think 
she will need somebody a little more...understanding of these things. I 
have lost a cherished friend once, so I sympathize with her.&quot; Rin 
frowned but relented, and could only watch as the Angel ascended the 
stairs to their room. She looked at Snowblood, who was only faintly 
stoic, and then to Ferret, who was downright miserable. She decided to 
go off by herself, to think things over, and to let her friends absorb 
this disaster and calm down.

Once things seemed a little calmer, Sarah finally asked, &quot;What about 
that guy that went with them&#151;Darred, I think. What happened to him?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the only good news in this whole tragedy,&quot; Sanaa answered. &quot;He 
thrust Aura into the warehouse before it blew up. It&#39;s safe to say that 
there&#39;s nothing left of him. It&#39;s one less enemy for us to face, 
but...such a cost!&quot; She wouldn&#39;t say anything else, except for a brief 
&quot;excuse me&quot;. It seemed then that the meeting was over, so everyone was 
now free to go off on their own and reflect what had happened. Yohko 
stayed behind, smoothing the wrinkles out of her coat, eyeing Pandora 
carefully.

&quot;Don&#39;t look so smug, Soma,&quot; she said evenly. &quot;I know what you&#39;re 
thinking: one less freak of evolution in the world, right? I would say 
the same too, if I didn&#39;t have a use for them. Unfortunately in my line 
of work, they are all necessary evils.&quot;

&quot;So what exactly are you using them for? Look, I don&#39;t mind working for 
you&#151;I actually like it&#151;but I don&#39;t get why you have to have so many of 
them around. It&#39;s like living in a leper colony.&quot; She sneered and 
shuddered, as if already infected with some disease. Yohko nodded and 
fixed her glasses, more an act of habit than necessity.

&quot;Look, I know exactly how you feel. You know our feelings on them are 
the same. If I had no use for them, I&#39;d take all my staff away from here 
and blow the place sky-high. But trust me, they are helping.&quot;

&quot;With what, your missions?&quot; Yohko frowned and invited her colleague to 
sit down. The two shared a couch; she draped her arm around Pandora, as 
if they were closer than they acted.

&quot;That&#39;s just on the surface, a ruse, a legitimate reason to keep them 
here,&quot; she said, her voice low and conspiratorial. &quot;You&#39;re a friend, and 
one of my most valuable employees, so I think it&#39;s time I let you in on 
my secret&#151;the real reason I&#39;m gathering them.&quot; Pandora smiled, and felt 
like she was finally making some progress in understanding Yohko&#39;s 
motives.

&quot;Go on.&quot;

.........

Joyce retreated to the small garden that she frequented whenever she 
wanted to get away from the world&#151;basically, her second home&#151;and Sarah 
came with her, squeezing her hand in support. Jameson was plainly crying 
even as she walked through the quiet rows of vegetables and flowers, her 
teddy bear hanging by its stuffed paw in her other hand. The two stopped 
at a stone bench and sat, letting the day&#39;s ironic beauty attempt to 
warm them. How wonderful: Aura would&#39;ve wanted this day to be pretty. 
Neither girl said anything; they just sat, holding hands, thinking back 
on how good Valeria had been to them, how she accepted them and 
befriended them, and how, luck aside, she had enriched their lives.

&quot;Just like my brother,&quot; Sarah whispered. &quot;Taken away from me... But this 
person was a monster, wasn&#39;t he? He meant to do this. I still hate 
Sally, but even I know she didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; She let out some air, and 
rested on Joyce&#39;s shoulder. Jameson turned pink just a little, smiled, 
and leaned over to kiss her dear friend on the cheek. A second 
butterfly, different from Kari but just as pretty, landed on Sarah&#39;s 
exposed neck, and rested its wings. Joyce didn&#39;t flinch when more 
insects came to gather around their mistress, not even when hornets or 
beetles arrived. She wanted to love them all, because Sarah loved them, 
and she loved Sarah, as only one monster could love another.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; came a voice from the door that led inside. Joyce 
looked up and noticed it was the Spoon Man, Haanz Glucklig. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
mean to disturb you; I just thought this might be a good place to 
meditate.&quot;

&quot;You can join us,&quot; Joyce said. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind...company.&quot; He smiled 
and thanked her, and took his time walking through the garden, careful 
not to disturb the girls. He did grimace a little as he noticed the 
insects crowding around Sarah&#151;truly, this young girl had awesome 
powers&#151;but he respected her and her symbiosis with them, and tread 
carefully.

&quot;I...heard you have both lost a good friend today,&quot; he told them a few 
steps later. &quot;I didn&#39;t know Miss Valeria that well, to my misfortune, 
but I can surmise she was well-loved. I&#39;m sure she is happy now, 
wherever she is. I just spoke with Miss Takamatsu; she seems confident 
of this. I...don&#39;t mean to embarrass either of you,&quot; he muttered shyly, 
&quot;I&#39;m just doing my best to comfort you. Forgive me if I...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Joyce assured him, smiling. &quot;I appreciate it. 
You&#39;re...not such a bad man, Mr. Glucklig. I just...wish more 
people...could be so kind.&quot; He chuckled dryly, rubbing his naked scalp.

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not that nice! Some people in here call me names, most of which 
are true. I&#39;m just...some fool who got a crazy power, and the will to 
use it to defend others. That&#39;s all I&#39;m really good for, but defending 
people isn&#39;t such a horrible life. I do wish I were more like you, 
though&#151;not thrust into this world of war, though I guess you are now 
involved. And there I go again.&quot; Now Joyce joined him in chuckling, and 
if she could move without disturbing Sarah, she would&#39;ve hugged him.

&quot;It&#39;s all right. Thanks for making us feel better. We&#39;re both probably 
going to cry some more, but at least...it&#39;s peaceful now. Aura would 
want that.&quot; He looked over and smiled.

&quot;Yes...&quot;

&quot;...What is it?&quot; Neither Mora nor Lyn felt like continuing their 
rivalry. The moment was just too heartbreaking to keep something so 
petty fueled. Neither woman bristled as Cobra came to the balcony, stood 
next to Bloodbane, and leaned against the railing. The day was 
beautiful, sunny and warm, the way their hearts should have been. The 
loss was terrible, but how much more would it have been if the day were 
murky?

&quot;Mind if I join you?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Johsen shrugged. Shival hissed. &quot;Go ahead. Not that you care, but 
I liked Aura very much. She... I think she understood me a little. She 
made me feel more...human.&quot;

&quot;Oh? I thought that&#39;s what you were.&quot;

&quot;None of us are human, Johsen,&quot; she stated bitterly. &quot;Being human means 
not having these freakish powers. Look at you, you&#39;re a snake, and I... 
Every time I bleed, I create a nihilistic object. You tell me that&#39;s 
normal. Aura, though...she really accepted herself, no matter what she 
could do or what she looked like. I admired that in her&#151;maybe even I was 
jealous. But I liked her, and now that she&#39;s gone, I feel...less of 
myself than before.&quot; Mora said nothing. She wouldn&#39;t even know how to 
comfort her closest friend, much less this woman she hated.

&quot;Listen,&quot; she said after a lengthy pause, &quot;I&#39;m no good at this sort of 
thing. I&#39;ve never had the opportunity to grow close to anyone. My family 
didn&#39;t want me, none of them. I had to live by myself, grow up alone, be 
my own teacher. It&#39;s a miracle I can even read and write. Even within 
the Divas, I never felt like I really belonged.&quot;

A longer pause.

&quot;You too, huh?&quot; Mora blinked.

&quot;You...as well?&quot; Lyn snorted.

&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong. At least you had a family, whether they liked you 
or not. I don&#39;t even know where I came from.&quot;

&quot;So you have amnesia?&quot;

&quot;No. I remember perfectly. I just...don&#39;t...know. The only clue I have 
is the word Solaris, and that&#39;s it.&quot;

&quot;Solaris?&quot;

&quot;A kind of flower found only in a tiny section of the world. It grows at 
a great speed, and its fluids harden in a matter of seconds. The people 
who discovered me thought I was half-flower.&quot; She chuckled to herself, 
at the absurdity of such an idea. Cobra blinked curiously.

&quot;Are you?&quot;

&quot;I could be,&quot; she shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ve endless possibilities with my history. 
But who cares, right? I&#39;m just Bloodbane, Lyn Shival, without an 
identity or a friend in the world. And I still hate you, Mora.&quot; She 
smiled faintly in spite of saying that; Mora returned it.

&quot;Oh really? Well that&#39;s great, cuz&#39; personally I can&#39;t stand the sight 
of you. You&#39;re so damned ugly...&quot; And yet...they found each other in an 
embrace. They shared each other. To love and to hate, to cherish and to 
cast away, to lose and to gain...

Clouds and sun high above the world, matted against a monochromatic 
sky...

Julie Smith cried herself to sleep, and she nearly dragged Kristin with 
her. Masterson was happy just to hold the tender-hearted girl in her 
arms, remembering to be careful with her strength. Even at its lowest 
level, she could crush bones and flesh with a tight enough squeeze, so 
she had to treat everyone, even the toughest person, with tender care. 
Maybe that was a way of compensating for her inability to express 
herself&#151;tenderness over words, quiet love over passion.

Julie woke up an hour later and smiled as she realized she was still 
safe in Kris&#39; grasp. She cuddled the dark-skinned girl close, so happy 
to be with someone who not only loved her for who she was, but even one 
who saw her as somebody beautiful, in and out. They didn&#39;t say much to 
each other&#151;all Julie did was cry, and Kris didn&#39;t know Aura well enough 
to comment&#151;but maybe it was for the best. Kris greeted Julie&#39;s awakening 
with a smile, and leaned in to kiss the girl&#39;s lime-colored cheek.

&quot;Feeling better?&quot; she asked. Smith nodded.

&quot;Yes-yes, Krissy good for making I feel better. Good person. Have very 
deep feelings for her. So good.&quot; She beamed beautifully, still unable to 
grasp the full concept of love, but willing to express it anyway with 
her limited vocabulary. Kris let the white-haired girl nuzzle her neck, 
feeling dizzy from the contact, and kissed her through that fuzzy mop. 
She wanted to hold Julie&#39;s face, to look into her red eyes, to see 
purity and love, the kind only a gentle monster could offer&#151;but no, 
Julie was no monster. She was...so gorgeous...

&quot;Julie,&quot; Kris whispered, fulfilling her desires. Smith&#39;s skin felt so 
good... She smelled so wonderful... Masterson leaned in, now a breath 
away from the kiss that had been interrupted the other day&#151;&quot;I...love 
you, Julie...&quot;

Their relationship was sealed forever with but single act.

Unfortunately, Julie had no idea what was going on. She just smiled, 
enjoying this new stimulus.

&quot;What was that?&quot; she asked once her lips were freed. Kris grinned.

&quot;A kiss.&quot;

&quot;Kiss my mouth? Why there?&quot; Kris was at a loss for words. How could she 
explain the epitome of nonsexual physical love?

&quot;It&#39;s...a very special symbol of love between two people. It means...I 
love you very much, and I wanted to...show you.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So Krissy loves me?&quot; Kris blushed and nodded; Julie, for her part, 
suddenly glowed bright with happiness, and tackled her friend with 
enthusiasm anew. She tried a few primitive kisses herself, planting her 
lips clumsily against Kris&#39; rosy mouth, sending jolts of pleasure 
through every one of Masterson&#39;s nerves. &quot;Oh Krissy! I love you too, so 
much! So, so, so much! I love you, I love you, I love you!&quot; Kris 
laughed&#151;she was being suffocated&#151;and wrestled back, playing with this 
beautiful girl, sharing love that was so primitive, so new and fresh and 
scary and wonderful. Then, after awhile, Lurker started crying again.

&quot;What is it, sweetheart?&quot; asked Masterson, cupping the girl&#39;s pretty 
green chin. Julie sniffled.

&quot;I wish Aurie was here...so I could say I love her too.&quot; She moaned very 
softly and flung herself into Kris&#39; arms again, but Masterson was not 
quite as receptive. Was Julie in love with Aura too? Did she even 
understand what she was saying? Didn&#39;t she know anything? Ah, but why 
would Kris know that as well, one who was so equally inexperienced? All 
she could really do was embrace Julie back, caress her and kiss her, and 
tell her that somehow, it was going to be all right.

&quot;I miss her too, sweetie,&quot; she said.

Xianq Shou wept, but not like one who had no hope. Angel reported that 
Kailin was feeling better, although she still blamed herself, and still 
refused to use her powers again. Xianq knew the Ronin well enough to 
have heard their story, especially the part about their journey into the 
Afterlife. If Aura really was gone, then she was probably there, resting 
in peace and happiness, away from every sorrow. She had returned &quot;Home&quot;, 
for good this time. How then could anybody be so sad at her parting? Yes 
Xianq missed her best friend, but...she could find joy too. Aura was now 
literally in Heaven, so there was no reason to be hopelessly depressed.

&quot;You all right?&quot; asked Steve, who had been beside her as she wept. Xianq 
Shou managed to nod and even smile.

&quot;It&#39;ll be awhile before I can walk around without feeling the pain. I 
might eventually become that hyperactive young woman I once was, but 
something&#39;s going to be missing regardless. It&#39;s not every day you lose 
your best friend, especially since...I had a part in...&quot;

&quot;You know it wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; he said. She took in a deep breath.

&quot;Yes... Now I just have to believe it. How&#39;re Sal and Merry taking it?&quot;

&quot;Well, Merry hasn&#39;t destroyed anything yet,&quot; he answered, smirking a 
little. Xianq finally giggled, just barely. &quot;No,&quot; he continued, &quot;they&#39;re 
both strong. Sal&#39;s more worried about Sarah&#151;you know, because of her 
brother&#151;and Merry&#39;s got her missing friends on her mind.&quot;

&quot;So today marks the first time, possibly, that we have all lost 
something. Heh... &#145;The Lost&#39;. I really wonder what all that means.&quot;

&quot;It means...that we&#39;re all the same,&quot; he replied, as honestly as he 
could. She smiled.

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;ve got a point.&quot; She leaned up to kiss him, placing her mouth 
on his. They were still a little unaccustomed to being a couple, but 
they were trying. Sally and Merry soon joined them, just as concerned as 
they had been, and together spent a moment as four friends would, if one 
of their own had passed on. Merry, who didn&#39;t know Valeria, still swore 
to avenge her, along with her missing friends if the need arose. Sally 
just wanted peace, and to talk to her parents. She longed for the arms 
of her mother and father, to feel them comfort her in this hard moment. 
So much death, in such a short period of time!

&quot;We&#39;ve got to have a funeral,&quot; Xianq suggested at last. &quot;Aura would want 
that. After that, we&#39;ve got to strike back at these enemies.&quot;

&quot;Where do we start?&quot; wondered Merry. &quot;We&#39;ve got the remnants of the Dead 
Zodiac, those people calling themselves the Seven, plus this woman that 
killed Rin and Kailin, not to mention that Dark Scion Kagemush&#151;I mean, 
Amielle mentioned. And do you think this Kissa character could be an 
enemy as well?&quot;

&quot;I hate to add fuel to the fire,&quot; murmured Sally, &quot;but Pandora seems 
suspicious as well.&quot;

&quot;One at a time, hon. Let&#39;s just rest for now, and have that funeral. We 
owe it to her at least.&quot;

Setsuka had her daughter nestled in her lap, explaining why everybody 
was so sad. Innocent little Kohona still did not understand death, but 
when it was explained to her&#151;&quot;It&#39;s when somebody goes away...and they 
never come back.&quot;&#151;she started to cry. She wondered why Aura would do 
something like that, but her mother told her that sometimes, people 
can&#39;t help it. Eventually everyone died&#151;&quot;Yes, even you and I will die 
someday, Kohona.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll leave me alone then, mama?&quot; Setsuka managed to chuckle.

&quot;Oh, not for years and years. By the time I go, you&#39;ll understand.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to go!&quot; she moaned, clinging onto her mother tightly. 
Setsuka hushed her child, blindly stroking her long hair with sensitive 
fingers. Rin, who had been talking to the Ferret until then, popped in 
her two cent&#39;s worth.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, kiddo! Dying isn&#39;t so bad! You go to this real awesome 
place that&#39;s better than anywhere you can think of! Think of it 
as...going into another world. Yeah, that&#39;s it! Aura&#39;s in another world, 
and she just can&#39;t come here because, well...it&#39;s really far away.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Kohona wiped the tears from her eyes but still looked 
inquisitive. &quot;If it&#39;s far away, how&#39;d she get there?&quot; And dear Rin, 
beaming happily, had the perfect answer.

&quot;Well, think of death as a kind of...one-way rocket ship. It goes so 
fast and so far, it takes the person to the other world instantly!&quot;

&quot;Really? Can&#39;t they come back the same way?&quot;

&quot;Uh, sorry, the rocket&#39;s one way. It turns into a star once it&#39;s carried 
the person away; that&#39;s why there are so many stars in the sky. I bet if 
you look real closely, you can see Aura&#39;s!&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; This unusual explanation seemed to please Kohona, who finally 
smiled and clapped. Ferret was more inconsolable: she had performed 
several ghosting attempts since learning about Aura&#39;s demise, but wasn&#39;t 
able to contact her.

&quot;It&#39;s like she&#39;s not even there,&quot; she murmured, out of earshot from the 
child. &quot;I hate to think...she&#39;d be in the other place.&quot;

&quot;Eh, don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s a big friggin&#39; place. Maybe it takes awhile to 
look for people.&quot;

&quot;...I hope so.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Rin exclaimed, drawing poor Joanna into her grasp, &quot;Why so glum?! 
We know she&#39;s in a good place, and we can probably revive her easily! 
Just look at Kailin and me!&quot;

&quot;Would you really ask this Kissa person to bring Aura back?&quot; Rin stopped 
to think about it, and came up with an answer.

&quot;...My God, that&#39;d be terrible! She&#39;d probably ask poor Aura to do 
something evil, like she did with us. I wouldn&#39;t even put my worst enemy 
through that.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it won&#39;t be so bad!!&quot; insisted Joanna, raising her voice in 
desperation. &quot;Maybe...she&#39;ll just have Aura do a harmless favor and 
that&#39;ll be that! Like...make a delivery, or cook her lunch, or fetch 
something from the store! We could ask her! We could beg her! We 
could...&quot; The woman looked away, afraid to let others see her cry. 
Setsuka sighed, placing Kohona in Rin&#39;s care as she went over to Ferret 
and touched her shoulder.

&quot;...You were in love with her, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;What if I was?&quot; she snapped. Silence. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to 
say that. It&#39;s true, I had a crush on her. She seemed like she&#39;d treat 
me like a normal person, and not...like a freak, even though I am one.&quot;

&quot;No more freakish than any of us,&quot; Rin offered, but Joanna wasn&#39;t in the 
mood.

&quot;You have no idea! All of you, even the ones that belonged to that Lost 
group, are normal next to me! I&#39;m worse than all of you put together! 
I&#39;m just a...mutated freak! Every time I get close to somebody, they run 
off in terror when they find out my secret! It&#39;s better if I never get 
close to anybody! Nobody would accept me for what I am anyway, not even 
her!&quot;

&quot;Joanna...&quot; White was now bleary with tears. She had to cover her face 
with her sleeve, just to appear more in control.

&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; she wailed. &quot;You don&#39;t understand, none of you do. You 
only think you&#39;ve had tough lives, but they&#39;re nothing next to mine! 
Just...leave me alone, please. I&#39;m...sorry to sound rude, I&#39;m 
just...sensitive about it. Excuse me.&quot; She stormed off, and nobody had 
the heart to go after her. Rin and Setsuka exchanged a glance, wondering 
just what was eating away at their friend, but they knew now was not the 
time to pry. Snowblood had a daughter to put to bed, and Rin had some 
inquiries to make.

&quot;What did you ask us here for?&quot; Amielle, Alicia, Marissa, and Sanaa 
stood around patiently as Rin wrung her hands, looking at each of them 
expectantly. She knew that if there was any hope of getting Aura back, 
it would rest in these people.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been thinking. If Aura&#39;s gone, can&#39;t we just bring her back, 
like what happened with me and Kailin? I know Kissa&#39;s a creep, but it&#39;s 
got to be better than what&#39;s going on now.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s possible,&quot; said Sanaa. &quot;You told us that Kissa was 
able to restore you, yes, but she had bodies to work with. Except for 
a...noticeable loss, the two of you were more or less already there&#151;and 
in case you don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t really think there&#39;s enough of Aura left 
to...well, I don&#39;t want to sound grim, so I&#39;ll just shut up.&quot; She looked 
to Marissa, who gave her a very pale smile. She was glad Sanaa had 
stopped when she did&#151;otherwise, the bad situation would only get worse.

&quot;...Oh,&quot; said Rin, grimacing. &quot;Oh. I haven&#39;t thought of that. And she 
did say that it was easier to restore life if the body were whole. Umm, 
Amielle, Alicia, any suggestions? You two seem to have exceptional 
powers.&quot; The shadow warrior and the possessed girl looked at each other, 
their expression far from promising.

&quot;...I can&#39;t work such miracles,&quot; Amielle replied. &quot;I can only deal in 
the dark. This goes beyond my understanding. If Pale were here...&quot; 
Suddenly, the room glowed brightly for an instant, and when it became 
dim again, Alicia&#151;now Pale again&#151;stood to her feet and nodded. Amielle 
grinned. &quot;Well, the squeaky wheel gets the grease...&quot;

&quot;I heard everything,&quot; Pale told them, &quot;but the situation is more 
hopeless than you know. If Aura&#39;s body were intact, bringing her back 
would be a simple matter. But even I cannot achieve that level of 
skill&#151;only my Master, the almighty one, and He will not listen to me.&quot;

&quot;What about with me?&quot; asked Marissa&#151;the first time she had spoken of her 
revival outside of Kamaguchi&#39;s office. Rin looked confused, but since 
she was the only one there that didn&#39;t know, she had good reason to be. 
Marissa realized her error, and so was forced to tell Rin of her own 
destruction and revival. But that only made things more puzzling.

&quot;From what you said, your body was just as destroyed. How did you come 
back?&quot;

&quot;It was a simple matter for me,&quot; answered Sanaa, though nobody had asked 
her. &quot;My soul just had to be moved back into my body, and the hole in my 
chest sewn up&#151;in layman&#39;s terms, I mean. Pale mostly did that on her 
own.&quot;

&quot;And Marissa?&quot; Wainright turned dark red from embarrassment. She didn&#39;t 
want to talk about it, not even to save her friend. The method used was 
just too indescribable.

&quot;That path...is unavailable,&quot; she managed. &quot;Trust me on this. We cannot 
use...that method. It is completely impossible.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it!!&quot; Rin shirked away, knowing when to 
leave well enough alone. Things really did seem hopeless now, but she 
didn&#39;t want to give up.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how determined you are,&quot; Pale told her. &quot;The fact of 
the matter is that Aura is gone, and there&#39;s no bringing her back. I am 
sorry. Sometimes...these things just happen.&quot;

&quot;So there&#39;s no other way?&quot; Pale shook her head. Rin&#39;s face twisted in 
disbelief.

&quot;What a load of shit!!!&quot; she screamed. Nobody saw her crying as she 
stormed away, and nobody would. The remaining girls simply basked in the 
hopeless silence, knowing there was nothing more they could do, except 
perform the final rites of passage, and pray for their friend&#39;s soul.

......

Everyone attended, even Dr. Kamaguchi and Pandora, though the latter had 
been forced to go. Since there was no body, a weighted casket had to 
suffice. The whole thing was held outside, in the garden that Aura had 
frequented, and nary a dry eye was in sight. The people who considered 
themselves her friends stood up to speak, saying nothing but praise and 
love for the young woman, each one proclaiming how much she meant to 
their lives.

&quot;She did not merely have an aura of good fortune to her,&quot; said Father 
Pochanski, who performed most of the service, &quot;but an aura of love, of 
devotion, of humble selflessness. She was always helping those in need, 
those who were most desperate for her skills, yet she never sought to 
further her power. For one so good to die so early in life, to be taken 
from this world so violently... It brings a tear even to my eye.&quot; He 
paused to dry his cheeks, and continued.

&quot;Aura Miracle Valeria, brought into this world against all odds. One 
could say she sacrificed herself in order to destroy the enemy. Others 
could say that she died so that others might live better, more full 
lives. Those of us here that know death, or the edge of it, know now 
that she is happy and at peace with herself, finally with those she has 
lost. No better fate...could await any of us. I was...happy...to have 
known her...and I shall miss her, though I know now she walks in the 
house of the Lord.&quot; He wiped his cheeks again, and excused himself for 
others to speak. Few refused a chance&#151;even Kamaguchi said a few kind 
words&#151;and once they were done, flowers were laid to rest on the casket. 
It was decided that the vessel would be sent to drift in the ocean, and 
so Aura&#39;s six closest friends volunteered to drive it down to the sea, 
and cast it off with tears and weeping farewells.

Later that night, Joanna White, not yet devoid of tears, paid a visit to 
her friend Kailin, and found her nestled safe in the arms of an Angel. 
Rin and Setsuka were sharing a bed as well, little Kohona sandwiched 
between the two. Sarah and Joyce were together, Sally and Merry were 
together, even Mora and Lyn&#151;even Steve and Xianq shared a bed. Few 
people could say they were alone that night, except herself. She stayed 
up all night, refusing to go to sleep until the stars showed up. She 
wanted to see which one was Aura&#39;s, to bid the girl she had fallen for 
one last farewell.

And so, the night opened, played through its act, and steadily turned to 
morning.

One week passed.

Joanna definitely felt better as she stepped outside in the sunny air. 
She was visiting what was now called Aura&#39;s Garden, the small place that 
Lady Luck had visited so many times, the same one where the funeral had 
taken place. It was now an eternal memorial to the girl, where anyone 
could go to meditate, and often many people did. Joyce and Sarah were 
there, already up and playing, looking much happier now that they had 
both been given time to cry and recover. Joanna smiled and even managed 
to laugh a little as she watched them run around.

&quot;Hi! Have you two seen Kailin anywhere, or Xianq?&quot;

&quot;Hsu&#39;s in her room with Kathy,&quot; said Joyce, who was making good social 
progress. When Ferret looked at the young girl, a kind 
of...understanding could be seen between the two, as if their pain and 
isolation were something they both knew. &quot;As for Beeg,&quot; she continued, 
&quot;the girl&#39;s off on some date with her boyfriend.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s great. Do you know if Hsu&#39;s in a good mood or not?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t say. We only saw her once. She didn&#39;t look happy or sad.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see. Well, I hope she&#39;s getting along okay. Are you two well?&quot; 
Both girls smiled brightly, holding hands and looking rather darling 
together. If at that age, they were just discovering the first twinges 
of love&#151;with each other or even other people&#151;then Joanna was happy for 
them. Even if she never found that special someone, at least her friends 
would, and that was a joy, the quiet sort, the one that few people 
noticed or appreciated.

&quot;We&#39;re pretty good,&quot; they sang. Joanna returned their smile and, except 
for some light chatter, left them alone as she patrolled the garden and 
took in its small wonders. Flowers, exotic bugs, the clear sky, the few 
other people there, the stone erected to commemorate Valeria... Surely 
the Lady Luck would smile upon it. After a few hours of staying in that 
place, Joanna decided to go back in for something to eat, but took the 
long way around since it was such a pretty day. She didn&#39;t pass anybody 
else, although if she looked very, very hard, she could make out a small 
blur off in the distance, like a mirage.

A mirage that was growing. A mirage that was coming closer.

She squinted, peering carefully (shielding her eyes from the sun), 
wondering if it was just some trick, maybe her eyesight growing worse. 
No, that was definitely somebody on the horizon, and they were coming 
closer, slowly closer, steadily onward. Probably a visitor, or a client, 
somebody here to see the doctor. Joanna decided she&#39;d greet this person, 
maybe make a new friend, and waited patiently. She soon wondered if her 
eyes were deceiving her again, for the person in the distance looked 
awfully familiar, and if she peered just right...

But no, it couldn&#39;t be! ...Could it?

Could it? She dared hope. Her skin crawled as the person came closer, 
closer, closer still, now so visible that she could see them limping. 
Her mouth widened in surprise, her heart leaping for sheer exhilaration, 
hoping that her vision was true. The person saw her, and smiled. Tears 
of delight formed and trickled down the Ferret&#39;s face as she called out 
their name, singing for joy.

&quot;...Aura!!!&quot;
