**********

Zanaan stood alone in a large lower-level section of the multiple floor 
Space Palace known as Deuteronomy. It was a hexagonal room. In the 
centre was a circular 40-metre in diameter glass chamber, secured by 
iron bars. In parallel lines to those bars were six pillars that held up 
the roof of the room. On the surface of the tank was a gold plaque that 
read MAHALAH. Zanaan stood before that tank. His body once more 
enswathed in his amethyst cloak though his hood had been lowered. Zanaan 
pressed two of his fingers against his left temple. His eyes were closed 
as if in meditation. After a few moments in that pose, Zanaan pulled a 
smirk and dropped his hand from his head. 

&quot;I see,&quot; He said to himself, &quot;so he&#39;s managed to escape. Perfect. Now 
it&#39;s only a matter of time before I have everything I want. There&#39;s just 
one last chore I need to take care of beforehand.&quot;

The Archangel&#39;s eyes returned to that glass tanker in the centre of the 
room It was completely filled with an oxygenated liquid. Wires were 
attached to the bottom part of the circle-shaped container. It was 
covered over with condensed gases, probably due to the clash between the 
warmth of the liquid and the coldness of the room it was in. Zanaan 
ignored it and stared at the entire container. Or rather what was inside 
of it. Bubbles floated up from the centre of the watery depths of that 
thing. Inside it was a sentient, living being. Zanaan stepped forwards 
and wiped the condensed gases from the glass. Which gave him clear sight 
of what was lurking within. The bulbous, writhing, sallow 
greyish-brownish mass of an entity which far surpassed human 
understanding. This entity was the Mahalah. And Zanaan smiled at it 
gleefully. 

&quot;So this is the Mahalah sample; &#39;That which shall be God&#39;,&quot; He mumbled, 
&quot;the &#39;shadowy demon&#39; of the Mu Civilization, the bastard alien child of 
Planet Golgotha. The Ministry really has gone out of its way this time. 
And Bardia and the Esdraelon Conglomerate are completely oblivious to 
the truth. Heh. But then maybe they all are. It doesn&#39;t matter anymore. 
All that matters now... is now.&quot;

Zanaan extended his hand at the tanker. &quot;Mahalah. You are only 
half-awakened... let me... awaken you fully... to fulfil your new 
purpose...&quot;

A dark blue energy started to glow at Zanaan&#39;s extended hand. One that 
emulated the intensity of his own spiritual signature. He stared at the 
Mahalah sample inside the liquid of that container. There was an 
internal rumbling sound One that came from the interior make-up of the 
sentient mass within the tank. And it reverberated through the room. The 
pillars that held up the hall began to shake. The bars around the tank 
itself did just that. The energy at Zanaan&#39;s hand grew in size and as 
that happened, so rumblings increased in their fervency. The wires 
attached to the lower part of the tank broke off from their ports, 
sending crackles of electricity and gas out from their length. The glass 
of the container then cracked directly at the point to which Zanaan&#39;s 
hand pointed. Some of the oxygenated liquid poured out from that crack 
and spilled upon the steel ground of the room. The Mahalah sample&#39;s 
&#39;groaning&#39; became louder with that. While Zanaan&#39;s dark grin started to 
widen even further. 

Far above that room, in which Zanaan was, was the Control Room. It was a 
large, four-tiered hall in which the primary defensive and offensive 
systems of Deuteronomy. On the three lower tiers were fifteen different 
technicians of the Ministry&#39;s personnel. Five of them were on each tier. 
They sat beside their own individual computer consoles which were 
interconnected with the fundamental computer system of Deuteronomy 
itself, the Eleazar. The top tier of Deuteronomy&#39;s Control Room was 
where the key orders were made from the one in charge. And at this point 
that happened to be Dianus. The woman sat on the reclining grey leather 
chair that stood before the railing of the top tier. Standing on one 
side of her was Isabelle. On the other side was both Allen Kuhnen and 
his assistant, Nina Tu&#39;vette.

Allen tapped two of his fingers against his cheek. &quot;Hmm. This all seems 
a bit odd. Shouldn&#39;t we begin the process of extracting the Anti-Lambda 
data from that boy?&quot;

&quot;There is plenty of time for that,&quot; Dianus told him, &quot;Don&#39;t forget that 
all aspects of the Master Plan have to be completed before we carry it 
out. Since you have yet to complete the Zarathustra, there is no problem 
in that respect. Now. How goes the shipment of the Seraphim Replicates 
from Shem to Rehoboam?&quot;

Technician #12 answered that. &quot;...The Shemite carrier ship Septimius is 
less than an hour&#39;s distance from Deuteronomy. It will be here shortly. 
Approximately 50 Replicates have been sent for the initial shipment&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Dianus told him, &quot;After they are brought here and each are 
processed, make arrangements for them to be transported to the 
Ministerial Bastion in Agnus Dei. From there, our operatives will have 
them sent to one of the Esdraelon Conglomerate&#39;s minor bases. If the 
reports we are getting from Crux Cartha are true, then sending them 
directly to Bardia&#39;s doorstep is out of the question.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am!&quot; Replied Technician #12.

Then suddenly a red alert flashed from the six overhanging lights and 
siren speakers to declare that something was wrong. Dianus, Allen, Nina 
and all the other technicians became attentive at the very sound of 
that. Dianus leaned up and blinked. &quot;What on earth?! What&#39;s the 
problem!?&quot;

Technician #2 tapped over his keyboard to find out. &quot;This is odd! The 
Mahalah sample! It&#39;s resonating!&quot;

&quot;Resonating...?&quot; Nina wondered, &quot;Resonating with what?&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t say, Miss Tu&#39;vette!&quot; Replied Technician #3, &quot;for some reason, 
the security cameras and energy signature sensors around the Mahalah 
containment chamber have been deactivated! Something down there is 
resonating with the Mahalah sample at an unbelievable rate!&quot;

Dianus narrowed her eyes. &quot;What about the Zophim?! Is it that? Is this 
phenomenon being caused by her?&quot;

One of the technicians, no. 7, tried to find that out. He tapped a few 
keys on his keyboard and the visual display on his computer screen 
changed to show a room in a lower level. It was the room that the 
Zophim&#39;s coffin had been confined in. &quot;No, Ma&#39;am! The Zophim is within 
containment and is not active!&quot;

&quot;Then what is this?&quot; Dianus wondered aloud, &quot;the only being we&#39;ve 
programmed to have any kind of powers of resonation with the Mahalah 
sample is the Zophim. I headed Project SIGMA myself. There is no way for 
there to be anyone else with that kind of power Who or what could be 
causing this to happen?&quot;

The face of Technician #9 paled. &quot;Oh no! Doctor Maximus! Eleazar has 
detected transportation energy 1.3kms from the outer layer of 
Deuteronomy!&quot;

Allen pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. &quot;...What? You 
mean...?&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; Dianus stared at the gigantic video screen on the other side of 
the Control Room, one which switched to a visual image of the space 
outside of Deuteronomy, &quot;the Saviours...&quot;

While some of the fifteen technicians started to relay facts about what 
was going on with the resonation of the Mahalah sample, the others began 
plotting out what was happening with the spatial transportations. And 
the video screen gave a very good display of it all. Outside 
Deuteronomy, in the starry black distance of space, was the 
materialization of numerous blue-tone energy portals. Each one of the 
seventeen was around 700ms in height and 800ms in distance. Those voids 
of energy rolled into and out of themselves until they began to open 
into ring shapes. Then Saviours started to exit from them. Not dozens, 
but hundreds of Behemoth-types slowly inched their way out of the 
numerous portals in the void of space. Each large transportation beast 
came from the portal with its fins moving it forward in a slow and 
floating march. Dianus, Allen, Nina, Isabelle and the technicians stared 
with shared horror as an entire armada of oversized Behemoth-types came 
in enormous numbers from those sixteen portals. 

&quot;This is just TOO convenient!&quot; Remarked Technician #4, &quot;first the 
Mahalah sample saturates and now the Saviours are attacking! Goddamnit, 
this is just too convenient!&quot;

Dianus sneered at that. &quot;Pull yourself together, damn you! There is 
absolutely no reason to suggest that the occurrence concerning the 
Mahalah sample has anything to do with this! Now get to work! Order a 
team of guards to assess what&#39;s happening in the Mahalah sample 
containment room! One of you activate the Lambda Effect Wave Shield 
Generators and then prepare Deuteronomy&#39;s weapons systems for our 
defence! Aim straight for Saviours!&quot;

Now that she had taken command, everyone got it together and yelled 
&#39;yes, Ma&#39;am!&#39;. Then they went about doing as she asked. One of the 
technicians made contact with the head of security on the Space Palace 
and ordered an investigation into what was happening with the Mahalah 
sample. Then others did what they could in Dianus&#39; request for the 
protection of Deuteronomy itself. Deep inside the frame of the fortress 
were the twenty unified Lambda Effect Wave Shield Generators that acted 
as the primary source of defensive action for this place. All twenty of 
those generators went about activating in unison, lighting up with gold 
force under the command of the Control Room technicians via the Eleazar 
mainframe. Then those machines did their job. An enormous, globular 
manifestation of the Lambda Effect, a gigantic Wave Shield, surrounded 
the entire complex of Deuteronomy. The repelling energy stood before the 
unhurriedly encroaching fleet of Behemoth-types. Once the Wave Shield 
was in effect, the third part of Dianus&#39; orders were carried out. Around 
5000 turrets, each of them being those on the side of Deuteronomy that 
the Saviours were about to attack, opened. From them extended in unison 
huge set of multiple round machine gun/Neutron laser cannon units. All 
of them took soundlessly took aim at the swarm of enemy beings that 
Deuteronomy were now facing. Then after a few minutes wait they all 
fired in unanimity. The wave of cannon fire passed through the Wave 
Shield. Thousands of beams of sparkling red energy as well as millions 
of energy-charged bullets were blasted from the frontal weapon systems 
of the Space Palace. Each and everyone of them crossed over the distance 
of space between Deuteronomy herself and the Behemoth-type space fleet. 
A glorious burst of explosions overtook the space around that area, 
overlooking the large blue expanse of Planet Rehoboam When it all died 
down, holes had been created in the lines of the Saviour forces But 
those holes were only minuscule. While the remains of the Behemoth-types 
that had been shot down still lingered, the surviving majority made 
their way forward once more. 

Dianus sneered, watching this all through the video screen of the 
Control Room. &quot;How many did we take out?&quot; 

&quot;No more than sixty...!&quot; Said Technician #8, &quot;and more Behemoths are 
arriving from the space-time tears!&quot;

&quot;Damnit,&quot; Dianus whispered, &quot;this is exactly what we don&#39;t right need 
now.&quot;

&quot;But why are they attacking Deuteronomy?&quot; Allen asked, &quot;That&#39;s never 
happened before...&quot;

Dianus banged her fist into the leather armrest of her chair. &quot;I said 
that doesn&#39;t matter. All that matters is being able to proceed with what 
we have intended for the Master Plan. We cannot let anything stand in 
the way of that. Not now. We have no choice. If our regular weapons 
cannot destroy them fast enough then we will have to finish them in one 
go! Activate the Longinus Cannon!&quot;

Everyone, aside from Isabelle, gasped hard at that. And everyone turned 
to her with mixed reactions of fear, surprise, doubt, and terror. Allen 
leaned into Dianus&#39; ear with a startled expression and tone of voice. 
&quot;The Longinus Cannon!? Are you out of your mind?! Not even YOU have the 
authority to use that, Dianus! You&#39;d need the permission of the Tsar 
before you could even think of attempting something like that!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take responsibility for it,&quot; Dianus answered, &quot;the council would 
permit this action if they knew that the Saviours were bringing a threat 
to the success of the Master Plan. All your lives, even this Space 
Palace itself, are worthless in the face of that. There is no other way 
to deal with that many Saviours in one place as we are now. There is no 
other choice! Now begin charging the Longinus Cannon!&quot;

Technician #1 swallowed the lump in her throat and turned back to her 
keyboard. &quot;...Roger...&quot;

**********

Ash groaned, stirring in his bed. Still dressed in his battle uniform, 
he shrugged up from under the covers and leaned up against the headboard 
of the metal bed. He touched his face and groaned again, then pulled his 
hand away and smiled. The restorative drug that Cream had given him 
after taking off in the Arayashiki had worked. His bruises and cuts had 
already healed up since leaving Crux Cartha less than an hour ago. The 
blonde boy clenched his fists and stretched his arms out. He felt better 
now than ever. Especially after getting some sleep, no matter how brief 
it was. He turned to his right and looked out through the porthole 
window of the room. It was one of only four bedrooms inside the 
Arayashiki. The little ship was bigger than a dropship but far, far 
smaller than a starship. And practically minute compared to a 
battleship. But it was good enough to get into space. And from the stars 
he could see, the Arayashiki had done just that. Ash shook his head to 
get the sleep-mode off his mind and then crawled out of bed. Ash grabbed 
the harness of his Sigmund-PRO8000 sword and slung it back over his 
shoulder, fastening it back around him Then he exited that room through 
the automatic door, into the small hallway between compartments of the 
ship. Ash came to the hatch door closing off the cockpit. Ash opened 
that hatch. Cream and Yoko sat in the two seats of the Arayashiki&#39;s 
cockpit. While Cream guided the ship by the control bars, Yoko turned 
around in her seat and frowned at Germanic descendant.

&quot;Feeling better after your rest, Sleeping Beauty?&quot; She said 
sarcastically, &quot;If you&#39;ve finished power-napping then we&#39;ve got a 
problem.&quot;

Ash blinked &quot;A problem? What is it?&quot;

Yoko just pointed at the transparent canopy of the Arayashiki. Ash 
stared out with her and gasped when he saw the scene. They had made it 
into orbit of Rehoboam and were less than 1.4kms from Deuteronomy. The 
thing was so large that it could be seen very clearly even from that 
distance. But the thing that bothered Ash was that a massive swarm of 
Behemoth-type Saviours were slowly floating towards it. Ash glared 
through the plastic at the sheer number of them. At least 2000 of them 
by now. Each of them opened their mouths and fired more of their 
powerful cannon beams at Deuteronomy. Waves of beams crossed the 
shortening divide of space between the Saviour fleet and the Space 
Palace. Those beams of ruby light bombarded the spherical Wave Shield 
that had now enfolded the entire building. Thousands of blasts crashed 
into the Wave Shield vibrantly and repeatedly. But none were able to 
break through it. Yet, such attacks would eventually overwhelm the 
palace. And Rain was still inside it.

Ash grit his teeth. &quot;Goddamnit! What next?! Now the Saviours are 
attacking that thing?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not just Deuteronomy and Crux Cartha,&quot; Cream told him, &quot;Look at 
this.&quot;

Cream tossed Ash her PM. He caught it and stared at the holographic 
projection. It was the recording of a news caster from Rehoboam. Ash 
watched and listened as the news caster spoke. &quot;This is Trent Davidson 
of the Ladeny Regional News. In the following fifteen minutes we have 
received numerous reports of Saviour attacks across the planet, the most 
notable of these being attacks on Crux Cartha and Agnus Dei. It has been 
suggested that each of these attacks were synchronized to occur at the 
exact same time and to this point there is no accurate picture to the 
extent of the damage or the number of lives lost or injured. But there 
have already been 329 confirmed deaths in over eight cities across 
Rehoboam. We will keep you informed of all developments as time passes.&quot;

Ash switched off Cream&#39;s PM. &quot;This is some kind of a joke, right? I&#39;ve 
never heard of Saviours attacking cities simultaneously. Can the 
Rehoboam Regular Military even handle something like that?&quot;

&quot;If not then they&#39;ll probably be calling for reserves from Alvastian and 
Shem,&quot; Yoko said, &quot;they might even have to recall the fleets of the 
Rehoboam Foreign Military battling Saviours elsewhere. But what bothers 
me is this. Why the heck would Saviours be attacking Deuteronomy of all 
places?  I mean, with the C-Gear we can still hide the ship from their 
presence, but-&quot;

Cream cut her off with urgency. &quot;Uh, guys!? I REALLY think you need to 
see this!&quot;

The two soldiers stared off through the canopy back to the course they 
had set for themselves towards the Space Palace. But that in itself was 
taking action. The underside of Deuteronomy was a metallic dome lined 
off with six compartments above it from the ground level. The dome was 
at least 0.7 miles wide which was phenomenally big with comparison to 
other space stations. The dome at the base of the Space Palace leisurely 
separated itself into six pieces attached to the nexus of the six upper 
compartments The six segments of the dome then closed themselves into 
the those six compartments The opening now created in the base of the 
building was filled again when something started to descend from it. 
From the chasm darkness of it came the 0.1 mile long barrel of a cannon. 
The Longinus Cannon. It was attached to another dome-shaped structure of 
metal which took the place of the previous one, clicking into place with 
the soundless clang of metal. That long cylinder barrel of the Longinus 
Cannon was pointed downwards from Deuteronomy&#39;s base. Then it started 
moving. It rose up a quarter of the way until it was poised at a 90 
degree angle, positioned horizontally from the bottom of the palace. The 
two half circle compartments on either side of the upper length of the 
barrel opened up. They jutted out to either side and was followed by the 
sound of more steel movement. Eventually that steel was revealed in the 
form of two thin electrode-like poles that switched themselves forward 
in the same manner as the head of the barrel. Then the two partitions 
above and below that point did the same. They opened themselves the 
exact same way which brought four of the electrode energy charges out. 
Each of them then slid back down the four trench grooves of the barrel 
until their spherical tops were aligned with the front of the cannon 
perfectly. From both sides of each electrode burst a sheet of metal. 
Each sheet linked with each other&#39;s neighbouring one, until the head of 
the Longinus Cannon had altered itself into the shape of a goblet. Then 
the barrel head itself shifted forwards so that the opening stuck out 
from the surrounding dish. Then the energy that had been gathered 
started to ruminate. 

Ash, Cream and Yoko covered their eyes when it fired.

There was a thunderous impact. If it could have been heard in space then 
it would surely have deafened someone. The Longinus Cannon&#39;s barrel 
jerked back as a TREMENDOUS beam of absolute anti-material force was 
blasted from it. That searing scarlet beam of relentless power rocketed 
expeditiously ahead with frighteningly devastating speed. It burned 
through the ranks of the Behemoth-types and incinerated what it touched 
with its wide 0.8km radius. The area around Deuteronomy was engulfed in 
tremendous crimson light that the Saviours shrieked venomously at. The 
beam of the Longinus Cannon ruthlessly eradicated both the beings in its 
way and those near it. Once it cut its way through the Saviours it did 
not stop. It kept on moving until it plummeted towards Rehoboam. The 
beam shot down into the stratosphere of the orb past the clouds of the 
nanomachine-ridden atmosphere until it was visible in the skies of the 
planet itself. The beam crashed violently into a set of mountain ranges 
nine miles southeast of Ladeny. And from that blast point, everything 
within a 3 mile radius was destroyed. The mountains, the land, the 
animals, the flora, the waters, the rocks, the soil, everything. It was 
all swallowed up in a titanic dome of red death that expanded as the 
explosion continued. The earth near the blast point cracked into itself 
and each crack streaked out from that area like a spreading virus. 
Tremors passed along the surface of the tectonic plate that those 
mountain ranges happened to be on. People in the un-attacked city of 
Ladeny felt those tremors themselves. The window and glasses cracked and 
then broke for kilometres around. Some of the townsfolk stepped out of 
their buildings and stared at the glistening red light of the explosion 
in the distance, terrified of what it might mean. The explosion 
continued and sucked up the straggling bits of rubble, tossed into the 
air, into itself. After a good 3.4 minutes of complete destruction, the 
red energy combustion triggered by the blast of the Longinus Cannon 
started to regress. When it did, there was a smoking mile-deep crater 
where those mountain ranges had once been. As well as twenty people dead 
and 600+ injured in Ladeny from NOTHING more than the tremors of the 
detonation. 

All that, and yet only 22.89% of the Longinus Cannon&#39;s full output had 
been used. 

Back in space, on the Arayashiki; Ash, Cream and Yoko opened their eyes 
again. They looked back out to the scene. At least two-thirds of the 
Saviour forces had been wiped out in little less than 58 seconds. Ash 
was absolutely astounded. &quot;What in the name of fuck was that!?&quot;

&quot;The Longinus Cannon,&quot; Yoko put forth, &quot;I had heard about it. It&#39;s 
probably the most powerful mortar weapon ever made in the Augusta Star 
System. It was one of the additions made to Deuteronomy during its 
design and... was one of the reasons that the Ministry is so feared. But 
they need the clearance of the Tsar to use it so...&quot;

&quot;How do you know all that?&quot; Ash asked her.

&quot;Lets just say... I&#39;ve dealt with information about it in the past,&quot; She 
replied, &quot;now lets move.&quot;

Cream blinked. &quot;Are you crazy?! We can&#39;t advance on Deuteronomy in this 
little thing when they have weapons like THAT!&quot;

&quot;The Longinus Cannon cannot fire continuously,&quot; Yoko told her, &quot;it has 
to recharge to fire again and that will take at least half an hour. Even 
heavy mortars like that have their limits. Just keep the Arayashiki 
steady. It&#39;s C-Gear will keep us hidden from the remaining Saviours. 
Okay?&quot;

Cream bobbed her head. &quot;Okay...&quot;

Cream put more juice on the boost thrusters of the ship and jetted off 
towards Deuteronomy once again. It blew its way through the numerous 
Behemoth-type Saviours, past those living and the remains of those 
burned to ashes from the blast of the Longinus Cannon. The Arayashiki 
kept moving until it was less than 200km from the Wave Shields of the 
Space Palace. The small laser turrets that the ship was equipped with 
aside its wings opened and started firing. Each blast shot at the 
gargantuan sphere protecting the place. But it was no more use than the 
attacks of the Saviours were.

&quot;It&#39;s not working!&quot; Cream yelled

Yoko sneered &quot;Damn! I forgot about the Wave Shield! We don&#39;t have 
anything close to what we need to break through something that 
powerful!&quot;

&quot;This can&#39;t be...&quot; Ash stared at Deuteronomy and the glowing Wave Shield 
around it. Rain was somewhere inside that prison. And the one thing left 
standing between them and Rain was that blasted shield. Ash gripped his 
hands into fists and scowled. This was the second time that he had lost 
Rain and now this thing was standing in the way of him making up for 
that. In his heart, he felt a savage churning. One of both anger and the 
ability to do something about a situation that seemed to be getting more 
and more hopeless as time passed. That sentiment of anger and the urge 
for the power to change things was what finally snapped him. Or rather, 
snap what was left of the part of him that was ignorant of what his 
Mother and Father had tampered with his genes for. Ash&#39;s body started to 
glow with golden light. Yoko turned back on her seat in the cockpit of 
the Arayashiki when she noticed it. But Cream kept her eyes ahead of 
her. And she was provoked into gasping when she saw something happen to 
the Wave Shield that was surrounding Deuteronomy. The part of the Wave 
that was directly in front of them started to &#39;bend&#39; into itself. It 
seemed to defy all known laws of physics but it was happening. And a 
forty-metre wide hole in the Wave Shield, one big enough for the 
Arayashiki to fit through, was created.

&quot;An opening in the Wave Shield?&quot; Cream wondered. 

&quot;That&#39;s impossible!&quot; Yoko turned back to Ash. The golden light around 
him was gone, but the significance of it was not, &quot;Did... you do that?&quot;

&quot;I-I don&#39;t know...&quot; Ash then shook his head, &quot;but it doesn&#39;t matter what 
the cause is! There&#39;s an opening now! Cream, fly through it!&quot;

The redhead nodded and put more spunk on the boost thrusters. &quot;Gotcha!&quot;

**********

Inside the Control Room of Deuteronomy, there was a deathly silence, 
aggravated by more than one thing. Dianus, Allen, Nina, Isabelle and the 
fifteen technicians of the room were utterly astounded. The power of the 
Longinus Cannon, even though it was running at less than a quarter of 
its full capacity was amazing. It had cleared away most of the Saviours 
that were encroaching on the Space Palace. But that was the least of it. 
The surveillance cameras had caught sight of that tiny little ship which 
had gone past the Saviour fleet. The one known as the Arayashiki. What 
had startled them all was that Wave Shield that was protecting the 
complex from the Saviours had been bent to accommodate that ship. It was 
a phenomenon that had been of great interest to the Ministry. In fact it 
had been a chief aspect of the completion of the Master Plan. 

Dianus leaned from her chair with both hands gripping the seat. &quot;It 
can&#39;t be...&quot;

&quot;Is that...?&quot; Nina drifted. 

Allen nodded his head, adjusting his glasses. &quot;Yes. There is no doubting 
it. That was the...&quot;

&quot;The Anti-Lambda Effect,&quot; Dianus stated, &quot;the ability to bend and alter 
Lambda Waves. Someone on that military ship has that ability. But is 
that even possible? The only ones with any knowledge of the nature of 
the Anti-Lambda Effect are the late Dr. Sorel and the doctors Gestalt. 
How is it possible for someone to... wait!&quot;

Dianus looked over to the technicians. &quot;What division of the military is 
that ship registered to!?&quot;

&quot;...It appears to be the Darshana Division.&quot; Claimed Technician #11.

Dianus leaned back into her leather seat with a self-degrading grin. 
&quot;Hmph. Now I understand. What a fool I have been. I&#39;ve been chasing the 
wrong boy...&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, Dr. Maximus?&quot; Asked Nina.

&quot;I should have figured it out earlier,&quot; Said the conductor, &quot;all the 
facts were staring me in the face but I overlooked them. I should not 
have been so presumptuous.&quot;

Allen stared at her. &quot;What are you talking about, Dianus?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t either of you see it?&quot; Allen and Nina straightened up when Dianus 
said that, &quot;there were only three people left who could have been 
implanted with the Anti-Lambda Effect data. The son of Dr. Sorel and the 
two sons of doctors Gestalt. Since Zanaan did not possess the data, we 
did not think that his younger brother would have it either. That is why 
we had Zanaan kidnap Rain alone two years ago. The one who possesses the 
Anti-Lambda data is not Rain Sorel... it is Ashriel Gestalt.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Allen said, &quot;So that was why we found no trace of the data in 
Rain when we first conducted the tests those years ago. He never had it 
in the first place.&quot;

Dianus bobbed her head. &quot;Exactly. We were wrong about the Sorel boy And 
I know for a fact that Ashriel is a soldier of the Darshana Division. He 
was the one put on trial for kidnapping Dr. Sorel&#39;s son after the 
retrieval from Protea. I suppose that he must have escaped from the 
Esdraelon Conglomerate building during the confusion caused by the 
attack of the Saviours on Crux Cartha This is certainly a very startling 
change in developments.&quot;

&quot;MEH, HEH, HEH, HEH!&quot; Everyone in the Control Room froze when they heard 
the twisted sound of insane and maniacal laughter, &quot;SO YOU&#39;VE FINALLY 
FIGURED IT OUT, EH? THE ONE WHO POSSESSES THE ANTI-LAMBDA EFFECT DATA IS 
MY OWN DEAREST LITTLE BROTHER! HOW HUMILIATING IT MUST BE FOR YOU TO 
OVERLOOK SUCH AN OBVIOUS FACT, DIANUS!&quot;

Everyone was taken aback when the sound of Zanaan&#39;s voice rung around 
the Control Room. All of the many computer screens across the tiers were 
then switched to a flickering head shot of Zanaan&#39;s face. The speakers 
above cast down nothing but his oily voice. The big scale video screen 
on the opposing side also displayed his face. Dianus, Isabelle, Allen, 
Nina and the technicians all looked up to it.

But Dianus addressed him. &quot;Zanaan?! What is the meaning of this?&quot;

&quot;DON&#39;T EVEN BOTHER TO INVESTIGATE IT,&quot; He answered sharply, &quot;I HAVE 
COMPLETE CONTROL OVER ELEAZAR. IF I WANTED TO, I COULD SIMPLY SHUT OFF 
YOUR OXYGEN AND SUFFOCATE YOU ALL. BUT THAT DOESN&#39;T SUIT MY PLAN AS YET. 
ASHRIEL STILL HAS ONE LAST GIFT FOR ME. ONE THAT YOU HAVE JUST 
WITNESSED...!&quot;

&quot;The Anti-Lambda Effect?&quot; Allen said. 

Zanaan chuckled to himself. &quot;MEH, HA, HA, HA, HA! THAT&#39;S RIGHT! THE TRUE 
SECRET BEHIND THE ANTI-SAVIOUR RESEARCH OF WILHELM AND MARIA GESTALT! 
AND THE KEY TO UNLOCKING MY TRUEST DESTINY! THE KEY TO BOTH ZONE 
BETHLEHEM AND CONTROL OVER THE POWER OF THE ELZABAD MECHANISM!&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s your game?!&quot; Dianus yelled, &quot;You&#39;re the one behind the 
resonation of the Mahalah sample!&quot;

&quot;OF COURSE!&quot; He said derisively, &quot;YOU, MICHAEL BARDIA, THE ESDRAELON 
CONGLOMERATE, THE COUNCIL OF THE MINISTRY; YOU&#39;RE ALL NO MORE THAN PAWNS 
IN MY GAME! THANKS TO YOU ALL, I NOW HAVE ALL THAT I NEED TO FULFIL MY 
HOPES FOR THIS BLINDED STAR SYSTEM! ALL THE HUMANS WHO HAVE TRICKED 
THEMSELVES INTO RUNNING FROM GOD&#39;S GRACE AND TAKING THE PATH AWAY FROM 
PAIN WILL BE JUDGED! SOON IT WILL ALL BE REVERSED!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not making any sense, you fool!&quot; Barked Dianus.

&quot;IF YOU DON&#39;T UNDERSTAND... MAYBE IT WOULD BE BETTER TO JUST... LET YOU 
SLIP AWAY INTO THE FIERY DEPTHS OF HELLFIRE! YOU&#39;VE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE 
WONDERFULLY, DIANUS! IT&#39;S JUST TOO BAD THAT THE REVENGE YOU SOUGHT FOR 
YOUR DEARLY DEPARTED LOVE WILL NEVER BE ATTAINED! MEH, HAH, HAH, HAH, 
HAH, HAH, HAH!&quot;

&quot;Damn you!&quot; Dianus yelled.

That just caused Zanaan to laugh harder. &quot;MEH, HAH, HAH, HAH, HAH, HAH, 
HAH! MEH, HAH, HAH, HAH, HAH, HAH, HAH, HEH, HAH, HAH, HAH, HAH, HAH, 
HAH!&quot;

The technicians around were startled by all this. Zanaan was not lying. 
Somehow he had control over Eleazar, and while that took place, they had 
no means of doing anything to stop him. They couldn&#39;t even call for 
help. But they had more to worry about than that. While Zanaan laughed 
like a madman through the speakers attached to the ceiling of the 
Control Room, energy started crackling in the air Then ten Slave-type 
Saviours warped into the room in random positions across the tiers. 

Nina tried to contain her fear. &quot;S-Saviours?! In here? But...!?&quot;

&quot;MEH, HEH, HEH!&quot; Zanaan laughed, &quot;HAVE FUN! I KNOW THAT THESE BEINGS 
WILL AFTER THEY FINISH TEARING THE FLESH FROM YOUR BRITTLE, COWARDLY, 
UNWORTHY BONES! KYAH, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA!&quot;

Dianus could only stare with fearful frustration as the Slave-type 
Saviours ripped their way through the ranks of the technicians. They 
grabbed the heads of the defenceless men and women and ripped them 
apart, limb from limb, one by one. Blood splattered across the many 
monitors and empty chairs along with the dying shrieks and frightened 
screams of those next in line. Some of the technicians tried to flee, 
but the Slaves jumped in front of them and picked them off with violent 
fury. One of the Slave-types climbed up to the highest tier and lunged 
at Nina.

Allen was wide-eyed. &quot;Nina!&quot;

The young black assistant jerked forwards from the waist when that 
Saviour ran its biometallic fist straight through her torso. Her blood 
and guts were torn out from her now lifeless body, robbing life with no 
calm. She toppled over dead. A second Saviour jumped from one of the 
lower tiers all the way up to the top and landed right before Allen. He 
tried to run, but the Slave-type simply grabbed him by the neck with 
both powerful hands. It cranked its fists around in opposite ways, 
snapping the man&#39;s neck ruthlessly with a gargling breath matted with 
blood Dianus and Isabelle backed up from the ravaging of their 
subordinates to the far door. But another of the Saviours had its eye on 
them. It lumbered slowly over to them. Dianus shook with fear, still 
hearing the sound of Zanaan&#39;s fanatical laughter in the background. The 
hulking Slave-type that stood over Dianus lifted up its fist to strike 
her down. Suddenly Isabelle, the bioandroid seemingly devoid of human 
sentiment, pressed a button on the key panel and roughly shoved Dianus 
through those doors to get her out of the way. Dianus stumbled backwards 
out of the Control Room and into the corridor. And when she looked back 
through the door, she could see Isabelle standing there, tears in her 
eyes, smiling whilst the Slave-type raised its hand to kill her.

Dianus was shocked. &quot;...Isabelle...?&quot;

&quot;I know... what I was...&quot; She said slowly, the steel doors closing back 
up again, &quot;...just a substitute for the one you loved -- Alexandra. 
Still... it was a nice fantasy... the hope that I could... take her 
place...&quot;

Three seconds later, Isabelle&#39;s head was punched clear off her shoulders 
And the doors closed the second that Dianus saw it with her own 
astonished, horrified eyes.

**********

The steel underside set of stairs came down from the thin hull of the 
Arayashiki ship. Ash, Cream, and Yoko, each of them fully armed with 
their respective weapons, charged down it and into the metal shaft 
corridor that the little ship had landed in. Deuteronomy&#39;s total layout 
had thankfully been uploaded into the mini-computer of the Arayashiki 
and so Yoko was able to familiarize herself with much of it before 
coming here. It was from that that she leaned that the prison cells of 
the structure were on level 19. That was pretty high up, but they were 
all sure that the Ministry had its hands fully with the Behemoth-type 
Saviours outside. By now they were no more than 200m away from the Wave 
Shield of the Space Palace. All it would take was a little more time 
before the charge for the shield ran out and they could pass through for 
a full-contact attack. It was only good luck that none of the Saviours 
could use the same method to enter as they did. Ash, Cream, and Yoko 
dashed down that elongated path straight ahead from where they had 
docked the Arayashiki. But it became clear that something sinister was 
going on inside Deuteronomy right now As they closed in on the fork at 
the end of the corridor, they noticed the bloodied corpses of at least 
six armed security guards. Some of them were leaned up against the 
walls, the others were face down on the ground. Their helmet visors had 
been cracked open and their guns were broken to pieces. Something had 
ripped them apart without much of a concern. And those beings made 
themselves seen. Ash the girls skidded to an abrupt stop when three 
large Slave-type Saviours materialized ahead of them.

&quot;Slave-types!?&quot; Yoko barked, &quot;In here?!&quot;

Cream scowled. &quot;I thought they hadn&#39;t made contact with Deuteronomy 
yet!&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter...&quot; Ash sneered at the three lumbering alien beasts 
standing in his way. He then reached behind his back and withdrew his 
elongated Sigmund-PRO8000 sword from the sheath on his back, &quot;Well okay 
then. Yoko? Cream? Lets kick some ass!&quot;

Both women nodded to him. Ash rushed forwards with the two projectile 
carriers flanking him He gripped his Anti-Saviour designed blade in a 
two-handed hold and jumped up in that narrow corridor. Ash then came 
down again with a revolving slash that hacked straight through the torso 
of the middle Slave-type, cutting along the groove of the brain, down 
the snub nose and mouth-plate, through the neck and steel chest into the 
stomach and down the innards of the vagina. The Slave-type released a 
muffled shriek and then collapsed to either side of Ash&#39;s 
Sigmund-PRO8000, its putrid green blood and sallow yellow intestines 
splattering all over the compacted walls. Ash then got up from the 
crouched position he landed in and started running once more, past the 
other two Saviours. Yoko aimed her Sankhya-PRO8000 twin handguns (Yin 
and Yang) at the skull of the right Slave-type. She fired and buried 
bullet after bullet into the armoured skull of the beast. Its green 
blood was spat up from the bullet holes when it dropped to the ground, 
dead. Yoko followed after Ash. Cream came in last, aligning one of her 
arrows (ice-tip) with her Sophia-PRO8000 bow. She released the arrow and 
let fly into the temple of the left and last Slave-type. It screamed 
horrifically when the arrow nailed it in the head and offloaded a small 
but very deadly vat of liquid nitrogen into its brain The entire 
cerebral structure of the monster&#39;s mind was turned into freezing cold 
ice -- and the Slave-type fell dead instantly. Cream them jumped over 
the three cadavers and caught up with Ash and Yoko at the other end of 
that long corridor.

Ash turned to Yoko whilst they stood at the door to the elevator. &quot;What 
floor is Rain on?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Answered the Asiatic woman, &quot;I only know the floor on 
which the cells are Nineteen. We have no idea if he&#39;ll be in there or 
not. But right now it&#39;s our best shot so we might as well start their 
first.&quot;

Ash and Cream bobbed their heads. Yoko pressed the button to engage the 
lift. The metal doors opened up a second later. The three of them ran 
into the lift and let the doors close behind them. Yoko turned to the 
key panel beside the doors and pressed the button marked &#39;19&#39;. The 
elevator started moving again. But not in the direction they wanted.

&quot;Um, Yoko...? Did you press the right button...?&quot; Wondered Cream.

&quot;Of course I did!&quot; Yoko remarked with a scowl, &quot;It&#39;s floor nineteen!&quot; 

Ash blinked &quot;Then why does it feel like we&#39;re going down!?&quot;

&quot;THAT WOULD BE MY DOING...&quot;

Ash, Cream and Yoko took notice when they heard that voice. But only Ash 
knew it or the significance of it. The blonde boy&#39;s free hand tightened 
up into a fist and his eyes thinned out angrily. He knew EXACTLY who 
that was. &quot;...Zanaan...&quot;

Yoko reached for one of her handguns. &quot;...Zanaan?&quot;

&quot;GREETINGS, LITTLE BROTHER!&quot; Said the Archangel through the speakers, &quot;I 
KNEW YOU&#39;D MANAGE TO FIND A WAY OUT OF THE INQUEST! AND I SEE YOU&#39;VE 
BROUGHT FRIENDS WITH YOU! HOW FUN! MORE TOYS TO PLAY WITH BEFORE I 
DESTROY THE PLAYPEN!&quot;

Ash stared at the ceiling of the lift. &quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing 
here and I couldn&#39;t care less! I just want Rain! Where is he?! Where&#39;s 
Rain, damn you!?&quot;

&quot;OH? WHY NOT TRY FINDING THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF? BUT BEFORE YOU DO... WHY 
NOT COME AND SEE ME? WITH MY NEW CONTROL OVER THIS FACILITY, I CAN MAKE 
SUCH A THING QUITE POSSIBLE...! HOW ABOUT IT...!?&quot;

Cream scowled. &quot;You&#39;re Ash&#39;s brother, aren&#39;t you? You&#39;re the one who 
took Rain in the first place!  Tell us where he is or I swear I&#39;ll make 
you regret this!&quot;

&quot;WHAT SOULLESS BEING SEEKS TO ADDRESS ME?&quot; 

&quot;What...?&quot; Cream blinked. 

&quot;A BAS-SERIES GIVING ME ORDERS!?&quot; Zanaan laughed, &quot;MUH, HAH, HAH, HAH! 
YOU JEST! HOW COULD ONE SUCH AS YOURSELF POSSIBLY CLAIM TO FEEL LOVE 
WHEN YOU KNOW NOTHING OF THE SOUL?! YOU&#39;RE AS MUCH OF A JOKE AS BARDIA&#39;S 
DAUGHTER OVER THERE!&quot;

Yoko took aim at the ceiling with Yang. &quot;You son of a bitch! Where is 
Rain!?&quot;

This time there was no reply. Only the sound of Zanaan&#39;s laughter. Then 
the lift stopped. They had hit one of the lowest levels of Deuteronomy 
(if not the lowest). The metal doors shifted open to either side and 
revealed another corridor It led to a hexagonal room. Ash stepped out of 
the lift and said, &quot;That bastard. I don&#39;t know how, but he&#39;s gotten 
control over this whole building.&quot;

&quot;Looks like he&#39;s inviting us to something,&quot; Yoko readied her 
Sankhya-PRO8000 handguns, &quot;it&#39;d be a shame to disappoint him, wouldn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

Cream appeared more subdued than the others, but tried to conceal it. 
&quot;Then lets go.&quot;

All three of the Darshana Division soldiers walked down that long 
pathway to that hexagonal room. They kept going until they entered and 
saw what was waiting for them. It was Zanaan. His cloak was still 
attached to his body but his hood was down. The glass tanker that had 
been in the centre of that large hall was broken completely from the top 
down. And the bulbous being existing within it had spread itself across 
the room. Dozens of dormant tentacles extended from the main body of 
that entity, stretching across the room and attaching itself to the fuse 
boxes, computer systems and power plugs. Ash, Cream, and Yoko looked on 
with dumbfounded expressions at the thing. As well as the one standing 
before its tanker. Zanaan turned around, his cloak flocking round his 
ankles, and showed his face. It was covered in dark green veins that 
pulsed as if beating rapidly with his heart. 

Cream winced, looking away. &quot;W-what is that thing...!?&quot;

&quot;This?&quot; Zanaan extended his arms to either side of his body, &quot;This 
magnificent wonder is what people in this realm would refer to as 
&#39;Mahalah&#39;. An inert yet sentient life-form that shall give me a power 
that goes beyond your wildest dreams. See the face of the future for 
yourselves!&quot;

Ash grit his teeth. &quot;What have you... done to yourself...?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing really,&quot; Zanaan stared as his hands. They too were 
throbbing with green veins, &quot;I have merely aligned my brainwaves with 
the thought processes of the Mahalah. Our minds now run as one. But 
this, as splendid as it is, is only the beginning.&quot;

&quot;Why are you doing this!?&quot; Ash barked.

Zanaan widened his smile. &quot;This being called Mahalah has the power to 
absorb human thought as well as the very cryptograms and algorithms of 
the soul Its mind doesn&#39;t simply interpret human nature. It absorbs it 
and that force then becomes one with its own flesh. Mahalah has been 
entombed for thousands of years. Just think of the information it could 
have assimilated in that time should that fate not have befallen it? But 
now I will set the change for everything. The time has come. By linking 
my mind with the Mahalah and allowing it to feed off my own soul, I have 
gained access to some of its powers My control over the Eleazar should 
be confirm that. But there is only one ability I need at this point. One 
that you shall see. Now!&quot;

Zanaan extended one of his hands and pointed his palm at Ash. The blonde 
man pulled up his sword as if to fight, but then felt a tremor over his 
entire body. Cream grew concerned when she saw Ash react like that. He 
lurched forwards and groaned. The Sigmund-PRO8000 was dropped from his 
strong hand and Ash clutched violently at his head. The boy dropped to 
his knees and groaned loudly, clawing at his hair.

Cream kneeled down to his side. &quot;Ash? Ash!? What&#39;s wrong with you?!&quot;

&quot;My... mind...&quot; The older one struggled to say, &quot;he&#39;s...&quot;

Yoko aimed Yang at Zanaan. &quot;What are you doing to him!?&quot;

Zanaan only laughed at that and kept on with what he was doing. His 
fingers writhed and Ash&#39;s body jerked according to the act, across the 
room. Ash&#39;s groan then transformed into a scream. And golden energy, the 
same golden energy that had appeared around him when he had come before 
the Wave Shield of Deuteronomy on the Arayashiki, was now flowing from 
his brain like a line of gases. It floated towards Zanaan&#39;s hand in a 
straight line and shaped itself into a golden ball of energy; one that 
hovered over that hand. Ash&#39;s body jerked once and he ceased screaming. 

&quot;Ash! Ash!&quot; Cream directed her fury at Zanaan, &quot;What did you do to 
him!?&quot;

Zanaan chuckled at the ball of energy over his open hand. &quot;Ha, ha, ha! 
Behold the power of the Mahalah! The power to alter mere thought and 
knowledge into a physical form! This orb you see before you -- is the 
physical form of the Anti-Lambda Effect data! The piece of the puzzle 
that was denied to me twelve years ago! Now it is mine! The key to Zone 
Bethlehem is mine!&quot;

Yoko thinned her eyes. &quot;Zone Bethlehem...?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve served your purpose now,&quot; Zanaan said to the weakened Ash, &quot;I 
won&#39;t even bother to kill you. Your fate and that of all the Augusta 
Star System is now sealed.&quot;

Cream and Yoko watched as Zanaan tilted his head back. The orb of the 
Anti-Lambda data was then absorbed into the flesh of his hand, adding a 
golden glow to the Archangel momentarily. Zanaan then spread open his 
arms and his body suddenly became transparent, as if it has lost all 
physical buoyancy. He started floating up from the steel ground towards 
the ceiling which he phased through effortlessly. The Mahalah entity 
behind him also went transparent, its material body becoming 
non-corporeal. It rose up just as Zanaan had done, following his 
commands. Its many tendrils were dragged up with it, which would 
probably restore Eleazar&#39;s control over itself, but now, that would seem 
to be the least of anyone&#39;s problems. Zanaan and the Mahalah drifted up 
with each other through the many floors of Deuteronomy until they both 
phased through its colossal roof. Out in space, the Behemoth-type 
Saviours were advancing on the Space Palace with ever more fervency. But 
they seemed to react to the signature energy of the Mahalah. Not that 
they were in any position to do anything about it. Zanaan widened his 
smile and proclaimed, 

&quot;In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth 
was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and 
the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. And God said, &#39;Let there 
be light,&#39;.&quot;

There was a tremendous crackle. One that shone a dark amethyst light 
over the upper levels of Deuteronomy as well as the Saviours launching 
their attacks on it. The light was so bright that it could be seen all 
the way from the western hemisphere of the blue planet Rehoboam. It 
peered from a thin slit in the fabric of time and space now no more than 
980m from Deuteronomy. That slit then opened and revolved around like a 
opening eyeball. Another bright flash of light over took the darkness of 
Rehoboam&#39;s orbit. And then the result was shone. A gigantic sphere of 
light purple negative energy -- more than 540m in diameter. While still 
dwarfed by Deuteronomy, its significance was far more glaring than the 
Space Palace 

Zanaan pulled a dark and triumphant smile, mouthing &#39;Zone Bethlehem&#39;, to 
himself. Right before he and the Mahalah floated to the sphere and 
melted themselves into it. Now life as it was known in the Augusta Star 
System had been put into a level of danger that only a few people could 
have understood the magnitude of.
