<p>Space Race: pursued by an inferno!</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“What?” Lyara smiled  mysteriously and wiggled her pointed ears, amused by Riene’s  puzzled expression. She had just returned from her date with Sati and  looked to be in a very serene mood: her face was aglow and her eyes  flickered with warm light. Lyara had always considered Riene a lovely  person--probably too elegant for the likes of her--but now she was  downright ethereal, and she couldn’t help but grin.</p>
<p>“Nothing. I’m just trying not to  abuse my abilities too much.” Riene suddenly remembered what Lyara  could do and turned dark red; the elf laughed and backed away before  she could embarrass the redhead. “You had fun, right? That’s all  any of us ever need to know. We’re being asked to strap ourselves  in, so you’d better get to it. The twins will be severely tested  from here on out.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know,” she whispered:  “the checkpoint around the sun, and after that, an asteroid belt,  an ocean, and a frigid ice-world. Sounds dangerous.”</p>
<p>“That’s probably why they chose  the Hagan system,” Lyara shrugged. Fuuka stuck her head out from  the hallway and smiled; her long furry ears flopped down.</p>
<p>“Actually, the sun’s checkpoint  shouldn’t be all that dangerous. If we angle our descent at…what  was it, 36 degrees…and accelerate at full speed, we should use its  gravity to get a huge boost!”</p>
<p>“This isn’t an anime, Fuu-chan,”  came Athena’s voice. Her long limbs grabbed the excited woman and  pulled her back, giggling and squealing. Soon even Lyara was  blushing, as she could guess what was keeping them so occupied.</p>
<p>“<em>Anyway</em>, I trust Kay and  Tee, but we should still be prepared. I hope you liked your…vacation,  because we won’t be able to stop until we get to Hagan 20. After  that, it’s the home stretch to the finish.” Riene followed Lyara  as they made their way to the emergency landing room, which had been  designed specifically to shelter crewmembers in case the <em>Dauntless</em> was forced to make a rough touchdown. The walls were padded and the  seats had belts, harnesses, and cushions to prevent the passengers  from rattling around too much. About ten women were already buckled  in and making the best of their situation (Chandra was “preparing”  herself for the star’s heat and was naked in her seat); Lyara  helped bind Riene, and Sharyn came by later to secure her.</p>
<p>“Do you know who’s ahead?”  Riene asked in the meantime. Lyara shook her head.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been paying  attention.”</p>
<p>“<em>Prince Mishkin</em> took an  early lead after the last checkpoint,” Shana reported. She winked  at Rebecca before continuing. “Hooray for Becky and her aunt. The <em>Zephyr</em> is in second place, but the <em>Colonel Lingus</em> is  gaining speed. They recovered pretty quickly after that accident.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Just what you’d expect from a  Felinis!” Alala exclaimed proudly. Yenae giggled and waved her tail  seductively.</p>
<p>“That’s right, those ladies can  go on all night, but I’ll bet my sweet-cheeks has even more  stamina.”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah,” she purred  innocently, “but don’t call me sweet-cheeks!”</p>
<p>“The <em>Screaming Skull</em> was  forced out of the race,” Valti sighed darkly. She hung her head and  grumbled, “Just another sad year for the Rennai penal colonists. I  say again, I’m glad I was never forced to fly for them.”</p>
<p>“I heard the <em>Renegade</em> is  doing really well,” Kyrie added. She grinned naively at Lyara:  “Didn’t you say you knew the captain of that ship?” Lyara  jerked her head around and glared furiously; her eyes were poisonous  and her teeth were bared aggressively.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk about it!”  she snapped. Kyrie wailed out an apology and stopped talking--she was  more interested in the star they were approaching. Although not even  a Pyrosian could withstand the purifying heat of a star, they could  study it and harness its energy more capably than other species.  Kyrie also made a note to return to Hagan 2 once she had more time:  she was tailor-made for its volcanic composition, and could probably  distinguish herself as an outstanding scientist and inventor with all  the materials available. Just thinking about it made her squeal, and  she hurt herself trying to leap out of her fastenings.</p>
<p>Within half an hour, the entire crew  had affixed themselves to something and were hanging on tight: the <em>Dauntless</em> would be violently shaken by the approaching star’s  gravity, and the Acheron sisters weren’t about to be gentle with  it. Even Rachel was latched onto something, and slept peacefully as  she hung chained to the ceiling of Amy’s room. Chandra had prepared  by taking off all her clothes (the sight of her nakedness didn’t  provide the same shock it once held), but it was a wasted effort: the <em>Dauntless</em> would be protected by heat, radiation, and other  powerful flares that emitted from the sun, and whatever warmth  escaped these shields would be inconsequential--it would be the  difference between late fall and the middle of summer, about fifty  degrees at best. The crew would not be able to monitor their progress  since all windows, shutters, and observational posts would have to be  shut and shielded, but Kay and Tee promised to give regular updates  based on the information they received. There would be no possibility  of electric power during the revolution--the sun’s magnetism would  short it all out--so they would have to rely on battery power.  Several women started holding hands.</p>
<p>“Is everybody ready?” Tee  announced. “We’re entering into the outermost region of Hagan’s  corona. Things are going to get pretty hot down there, so try not to  move around too much. There are emergency water bottles for you all,  but don’t get greedy--it’ll take us at least an hour before we  can move on.”</p>
<p>“Most of the previous vessels  strayed far outside Hagan’s orbit, then flew in through the  checkpoint so as not to be drawn in by gravity pull,” Kay reported.  “They put their engines to full blast and shot right out. It takes  longer, but it’s the safest route.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’ve got a bad feeling telling  me they won’t follow <em>that</em> example,” Herut muttered.</p>
<p>“So what’s the fastest way outta  this?” Naja yelled.</p>
<p>“Well, we’d have to approach  Hagan’s spin-orbit much sooner, catch it without drawing any  closer, ride it all the way through, and shoot out at the proper  trajectory. Basically, we’d be like flies trying to hitch a ride on  a toy top that’s on fire.”</p>
<p>“Shit, forget about that!”</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s not impossible  to pull off,” Shana explained. She grinned cutely and began  explaining the physics of it, which was both entertaining and  complicated. Only a few people understood what she said (Alala was  one of them), so somebody had to water it down.</p>
<p>“What Fuuka said earlier wasn’t  entirely fictional,” the catgirl stated. “Let’s think back to  the fly analogy. If the fly approaches the top directly, of course  it’ll get burned up, but if it angles its escape at 35 degrees  right when the top is revolving out, it will escape the pull and thus  be shot out much faster than anything it could make on its own. The  sun isn’t like a planet or a satellite: it doesn’t revolve around  anything. Rather, <em>it</em> does the spinning, and all the other  planets are like its slings. But the sun also revolves like a toy  top, and if the fly jumps directly on that top and jumps off at the  right moment, uh…you all aren’t getting this at all, are you?”</p>
<p>“Sort of,” Allegra winced.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we can kinda see it in our  heads,” Fuuka grimaced. Valti sighed gloomily.</p>
<p>“<em>I</em> understood it.” Shana  was content with that and concluded her lecture.</p>
<p>“Regardless, it’s going to be a  rough ride. The ship will actually go faster than it technically can  for a few minutes. There’ll be a fair share of shaking and  rattling, but the trick is slowing down after that.”</p>
<p>“What for!?” Naja screamed. “I  know this bucket of bolts can take that kind of punishment, so why  would we wanna give up our lead?!”</p>
<p>“Because if we don’t slow down,  the asteroid belt surrounding the next checkpoint will turn us into a  flying junkyard,” Yenae answered coolly. “Not even Orihalcum  could withstand an onslaught like that at the speed we’re talking  about.” Naja snorted, crossed her arms, and lashed her tongue in  the air.</p>
<p>“I knew that.”</p>
<p>“Settle down back there!” Kay  shouted. “We’re approaching Hagan. It’s going to be Hell from  here on out.” The women became grim and clutched tighter to their  harnesses; they could already feel the universe rumbling as the <em>Dauntless</em> dove into Hagan’s gravity field. Herut let out a  disappointed breath.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“See? I knew they’d do something  stupid like this. The way those two treat it, this thing would’ve  fallen apart ages ago if I hadn’t been there! I’m sure going to  have my hands full once we settle down again!” Shana giggled and  gave her a proud smile; Herut grinned back, in spite of her  annoyance. The next hour was a tribulation for crew and vessel alike:  Hagan was about as young and large as Helios, and it burned with a  merciless fury that lashed against the <em>Dauntless</em> like an  enraged taskmaster who was only restricted by the length of his whip.  Several times, a stray flare shot out and deadened the whole ship:  life support, communications, readouts, even artificial gravity were  shut down. Emergency power was turned on and the twins were forced to  rely on their skills and the laws of physics. Another flare belched  out and covered the checkpoint, rendering all access temporarily  closed--but the <em>Dauntless</em> could not slow down or stop, and  raced towards the fiery gate with demonic persistence.</p>
<p>“Things must be reaching a  critical level,” Lyara whispered. The main lights in the emergency  room were off, so she was cast in an eerie red glow. “I can sense  their feelings, you know. It’s difficult picking them apart from  all of yours--I guess you can’t help but feel scared at a time like  this--but they’re worried we might not make it. I think something  just came up.”</p>
<p>“Well, we’re not dead yet,”  Aseria said confidently. “Those two may be a little unsociable and  stiff, but their skill is peerless. Maybe only Arileth Naiis or the  Ozmund Company could ever match them. Even if they do fail, we know  they gave it everything they had. We can’t blame them for that.”</p>
<p>“That’s right!” Fuuka  exclaimed cheekily. “All of this is Naja’s fault! She should be  the first to die if we don’t make it through!”</p>
<p>“Say that again once we’ve won  first place!” she countered nastily. It was a good thing they were  both restrained, because otherwise a fight would’ve broken out. In  spite of their worries, the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> rode out  their latest trial as the Acheron twins dove underneath the arch of a  flare, brushed against the checkpoint, and rode the slingshot gravity  to freedom. Escaping was a nightmare--soon all conflicts and problems  were forgotten as the crew focused solely on staying in one  piece--but this passed as well, and once the <em>Dauntless</em> had  settled down, the twins brought the ship to a shaky crawl. Power  returned shortly thereafter, and the first thing they did was restore  communications to inform their companions of the victory.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Mr. D, it has come to my  attention that the ones I have asked you to remove have just passed  the checkpoint around Hagan’s sun and are now en route to the  asteroid field. The Jackal is keeping a close watch on the Dead  Roses, and has assured me they will meet their proper end once the  race is over. I am sending our greatest exterminator to greet them,  so all you need to concentrate on is the <em>Dauntless</em>. Bear in  mind that you are tolerated out of sheer amusement, and any use you  may contribute to my organization is completely miniscule. However, I  am willing </p>
<p>to give you chances, permitting you  act according to your promises. I must inform you one more time that  failure will lead to <em>unpleasantness</em>. Do promise you will not  waste my time.”</p>
<p>That was the end of Master’s  transmission. Derian scowled and smashed the recorder on the floor,  then kicked it until it ran into a robot sweeper, who took it for  garbage and swept it up. So the Jackal really was in on this! Derian  had been hailed as a devious meddler, a genius, a fierce opponent,  and a man who could topple entire empires from the safety of the  shadows--and he had the Fog Ninjas as well! Yet no matter what kind  of victory he achieved or how much effort he put forth, setbacks or  not, Master would only look kindly upon that apathetic witch, and she  wasn’t even loyal to the cause! Derian had promised life and limb  to Master, because he <em>believed</em> in Master and wanted to mold  the universe at his side, but now… Things were so bad that he had  to resort to <em>this</em>. Derian would have to risk his own life if  he wanted to please Master--he would have to attack the <em>Dauntless</em> inside the asteroid field.</p>
<p>And so, the <em>Backdraft</em> returned to service, deadly and pathetic all at once. He had put the <em>Screaming Skull</em> out of commission according to the designs  laid out by Rennai Police, and was on the verge of eliminating the <em>Einlanzer 3, Bulldozer, Kemosabe, </em>and <em>Stormrider</em> as  well. Master didn’t tell him to do it--those were his own plans.  But now, all that had to be laid aside for a more important venture.  Derian hated giving the <em>Dauntless</em> more precedence, but his  fear of retribution overpowered every other feeling he had, and he  went to work like the obedient little drone he was.</p>
<p>According to Master’s design, the <em>Backdraft</em> had already cleared every checkpoint and only needed  to cross the finish line to win, so Derian could take his time  hunting. He wouldn’t have to risk his life searching for the marker  in the asteroids (or anywhere else); he just needed to make sure his  enemies never came out of that death-trap. He slipped into the field  and planted several mines at key positions, then hid on one of the  larger rocks and waited for his prey to arrive. According to reports,  the <em>Dauntless</em> had an Orihalcum alloy built into its armor, so  he would have to cripple its systems with a sonic disruptor before  unleashing a special corrosive. It came shortly after he settled in,  just as Master said, tentatively crawling through the flying rocks,  boulders, and dust clouds. Unlike the sun checkpoint, there was no  way around the asteroids, but there were safe paths that led to the  marker, and Derian was counting on his enemies to take those paths.</p>
<p>The first blast went off  immediately. Explosions are silent in space. Since there is also no  atmosphere, there are no fires or fumes, but there is a lot of  debris, and when debris strikes other debris, it creates even more  interference, so even one explosion can cause significant long-term  damage (Derian had planted seven). He didn’t giggle for joy just  yet, even though it was fun watching his enemies stumble blindly into  his trap. The hull would be battered and bruised, but the ship would  have just enough energy to limp on into his next attack. Derian set  off explosives number two, three, and even number four, just for fun,  and finally cackled out loud as the <em>Dauntless</em> was smothered by  bits and pieces of asteroid. It was like watching a rotting bison  being surrounded by flies: they ate away at the ship, and soon there  would be nothing left but bones and bodies floating in the darkness.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kazcada was stunned momentarily as  the <em>Dauntless</em> started blasting the rocks away.</p>
<p>“I forgot about that upgrade they  took in after the tussle with Chuunaru,” he muttered to himself.  “No matter; I still have plenty of explosives left. They can’t  possibly blast every asteroid here.” He set off another bomb, but  waited for it to go off in vain: the <em>Dauntless</em> was shooting  with surgical precision, and had somehow picked up his hidden  devices. Frustrated, Derian set off his remaining detonations all at  once, but the asteroid field remained undisturbed, and the <em>Dauntless</em> passed through the first gauntlet relatively unscathed. His rage  increased even more as he watched them pass by and loop through the  checkpoint; the nose turned up away from the asteroids into safety,  and in his anger, Derian followed them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> was just wrapping up their sighs of relief. They didn’t expect  those first two bombs, but they were prepared for the others, and  thanks to some clever teamwork and a considerable deal of  technological finagling (Herut, Kyrie, and Eve worked their fingers  to the bone making that locator), they were able to save themselves  any further trouble. But it had been a ride, all the same. The ship  was in terrible shape and was limping as bad as Dr. Miracle herself.</p>
<p>“I just hope one of them has a  chance for recovery!” Fuuka exclaimed wearily. But nobody was given  time to rest or reflect just yet: Derian was openly attacking them,  and he wasn’t holding back. He even managed to grab a few asteroids  with his ship’s grappler arms and threw them out; Eve and Allegra  took the main guns and defended their territory well.</p>
<p>“So he’s actually attacking us <em>inside</em> the asteroid field?” Kasberry shouted.</p>
<p>“Looks like it! I guess he got  tired o’ sendin’ his lackeys after us and came by to finish the  job hisself. Looks like we’re just a cat caught in a tree!”</p>
<p>“I think I’ve seen something  like this in an old Earth film before. It was about a guy who went  into an asteroid field to escape his pursuers. I thought it was a  documentary at first!”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? What happened to em’?”</p>
<p>“Well, the guy went inside this  cave that was in one of the larger asteroids so he could wait for his  enemies to pass him by. But that turned out to be a big mistake--they  weren’t alone in that cave!”</p>
<p>“Scratch one idea,” Allegra  mumbled. “I’m guessin’ his enemies didn’t make it out.”</p>
<p>“No, but here’s the thing: the  heroes made it out safely, and they hid themselves on the radar  control of their enemy’s ship so they couldn‘t be found. Once  everything settled down, they disguised their ship in the enemy’s  garbage, and floated away safe. Uh…I didn’t see what happened  after that. I had to give the film back to my old boss, and she lost  it.”</p>
<p>“Can’t really apply that here,  sug,” Allegra called out. The <em>Backdraft</em> and the <em>Dauntless</em> were locked in a mortal dogfight amidst the rubble of the asteroid  belt; occasionally they would be </p>
<p>struck by a glancing rock, and  sometimes one of the larger ones sailed precariously by. The Acherons  were too skilled to be taken down by space rocks, but they had to  give their enemy credit as well--he was no slouch when it came to  dancing around flying boulders. That they managed to fly and fight  each other was a marvel in itself.</p>
<p>“You’d think they’d at least  try and get us <em>out of this fucking mess we’re in!</em>”  Lillianne screamed. “What’s going on in their heads, anyway?  Okay, so I get we were ambushed in a vulnerable position! Fine! But  they could, ya know, try and get <em>out</em> before blasting the other  guy to pieces!”</p>
<p>“Would if we could,” Tee  grumbled; apparently her transmission had picked up that latest rant.  “It’s not a matter of just flying somewhere safe, you know. This  guy isn’t fooling around: he’s really out for our blood.”</p>
<p>“Shields are at 59,” Kay added.  “Try to relax, okay? We’re working on an escape plan. Once we’re  free, we’ll turn the tables and he won’t know what hit him.”</p>
<p>“Oh, he’ll know, all right!”  Lil roared sadistically. “The moment we catch up to that little  prick, my foot’s going right for his testicles! I’ll tear his  face off and shove his teeth through his ears, then I’ll punch a  hole through his belly, rip out his spinal cord, and use it to hang  him by his ankles! After that, I’ll start getting <em>nasty!</em>”  Aseria rolled her eyes, wishing that her companion could at least try  to show some civility.</p>
<p>“I’d be content to crack his  ship open and watch him slip into the void,” she muttered. “So  can we radio anybody for help?”</p>
<p>“Negative,” Kay said, “the  asteroids are interfering with our broadcast. Eve, Allegra, keep  firing! Pardon me, but one of the big asteroids we hit burst into a  big particle shower, and our enemy accidentally flew right into it.  He’s as blind as we were when the <em>Opportune Rain</em> jettisoned  on us.”</p>
<p>“Holy shit, that’s right!”  Naja blurted suddenly. “This is the same guy that attacked us back  then, isn’t it? Damn it, I wanted to get my revenge, too! Why do  the freaks get to have so much fun?!” Tee spat in shock; the effect  was lessened since nobody could see her face.</p>
<p>“If you want to try flying this  thing while dodging asteroids and fighting an unpredictable maniac,  be my guest!”</p>
<p>“I <em>am</em> qualified,” Naja  answered humbly. Her face suddenly lit up and she pushed her way into  the main cockpit, shoving the twins aside. They politely brushed  themselves off and stepped away, wondering how long it would take  before Naja regretted her decision. She turned out to be surprisingly  competent, and even managed to give the <em>Backdraft</em> the slip.  Naja had to drain the ship’s ammunition and most of its energy, but  now they were clear of the danger and had a good long stretch of  space to run in.</p>
<p>“Full speed ahead!” the Elshyrin  screeched triumphantly. It was hard not to laugh at the situation:  nobody expected Naja to save the day or redeem herself. The <em>Backdraft</em> quickly </p>
<p>emerged from its prison and chased  after the <em>Dauntless</em>, but it was in no condition to run, and  was forced to putter along on reserve power and sheer momentum. Naja  Elapidae laughed at her opponent and easily put distance between  them, and soon their enemy was just a speck in the distance.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Ten minutes passed before she  collapsed out of misery. She had completely forgotten about her  beautiful revenge.</p>
<p>“Darn it,” she groaned. “And  we had em’ in our sights, too. This really sucks! I don’t wanna  go back, but I still feel like blasting that son of a bitch!  Uuugghh…Kayleigh, Teleah, why don’t you take over? I need to  punch something.”</p>
<p>“You’ve earned that at least,”  they said warmly. She managed to return their smile, and slithered  over to the training room, hoping to find a sparring partner.  Striking a punching-bag just wasn’t her style.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>The crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> had  a bit more competition for the next two checkpoints, but at least  their rivals weren’t nearly as aggressive as Derian had been!  Kaori, Lord Demise Jr., Shandra, and Fai-lynn of Tigris had all made  it to the aquatic world of Hagan 5 at the same time, which meant they  would all be swimming together to reach the checkpoint. Race  officials had cleverly hidden it underneath the vast oceans, and  scanning equipment could only venture so much before the pilots were  forced to rely on instinct. Lord Demise Jr. chivalrously decided to  point out where the marker was so the other ladies wouldn’t have  such a hard time finding it, and went on ahead with all sensors  running. Aseria, who had taken over piloting the <em>Dauntless</em> for  the weary Acheron sisters, couldn’t help but chuckle at the boy’s  enthusiasm, but preferred to rely on her own abilities. She dove in  second and the race began anew.</p>
<p>Infinite oceans require infinite  time to describe, and the waters of Hagan 5 were vast and  ever-changing. Among the thousands of wonders lurking in the deep  were whales that could rise above the surface and float briefly in  the air; they had a civilization and a society all of their own, and  were regarded as intelligent species, though they rarely interacted  with the outside worlds. There were also mer-folk swimming around,  but they were mostly wild and savage creatures who either ran from  the competing vessels or attacked them, throwing spears and exquisite  projectiles (there were, of course, civilized mer-folk, but they were  scarce on this planet, and they only revealed themselves once to  cheer for the brave pilots). Fai-lynn was mesmerized by the clusters  of aquatic life and vowed to return here for a fishing expedition  (and to possibly seduce some mermaids); Kaori patrolled the waters  cautiously, wary of leviathans, serpents, krakens, and the like.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An important notice must be made  about these alien forms of life. While human civilization thrived on  Gaia (or Earth), stories were created about mythical creatures and  fictional lands. Gods, heroes, demons, spirits, and other fantastic  beings interacted in these stories all the time, but with only a few  notable exceptions, such as the validity of the Trojan War, these  myths remained myths. Progression into the far reaches of space  proved many of these “fantasies” to be alarmingly realistic:  there <em>were</em> such thing as mermaids, unicorns, krakens,  Cyclopes, centaurs, and intelligent beasts of every species; one just  had to look for them, and more importantly, one had to love and  admire them with prudence and respect. A Gorgon could be your friend  or your enemy, depending on how you treated them (results of the  latter spoke for themselves).</p>
<p>Kaori’s caution paid off. She had  been watching for these kinds of creatures, and was prepared to run  when an enormous squid passed next to her. Luckily, it was not on the  prowl and regarded the amphibious ships with the same indifference it  gave to the whales, and so Kaori escaped to clear the marker first.  Lord Demise Jr. nearly ran into it as he searched for the checkpoint,  and poor Fai-lynn accidentally attacked it. The monstrous mollusk was  stunned, and lashed out lazily, like a horse swatting flies with its  tail. Fai-lynn barely escaped with one of her nine lives, and from  that moment on, her crew never stopped making “tentacle” jokes.  Shandra’s determination to seek out the checkpoint on her own meant  she went through after everyone else, but she went through without  any trouble; even the <em>Dauntless</em> was halted as two warring  armies of mer-folk interfered with their voyage.</p>
<p>An entirely new set of rivals gave  them a challenge during the long marathon run to the ice world. Kaori  still hung around to pester them, but now the <em>Zephyr</em> was in on  the fun, and was showing just why it was a fan favorite: it had  Sati’s acceleration, the equipment of the <em>Opportune Rain</em>,  the duration of the <em>Dauntless</em>, and a top-notch pilot who took  his job very seriously. Tinma was a worthy foe and an honorable man;  he made sure to keep his work clean and fair, and never held back  even in the long cold loneliness. Sati had come around as well, and  was trying to goad Aseria and Kaori for a rematch, but neither woman  was going to take the bait (but at least Aseria didn’t ignore the  outgoing woman). Lyara panicked as she saw the <em>Renegade</em>, and  prayed her presence would go unnoticed. Rebecca and Sharyn wanted to  confront her about it, since they felt like they were fairly close to  her, but Lyara just shook her head and asked to be left alone.</p>
<p>“It’s just a personal matter,  all right? I don’t want you involved. Asara can be a ruthless,  manipulative devil when she’s in the mood, and she can turn your  best friends into your mortal enemies. If nothing else happens  between us from here on out, there won’t be much point in telling  you anyway. It’s just…old history to me now. I am glad you care,  but please…don’t ask me anymore.”</p>
<p>“If you so wish it, may it be  done.” Sharyn gave her a shy, pretty smile, and left the room;  Rebecca thought Lyara could use a hug, and approached her. She was  held back by a soft gesture.</p>
<p>“Don’t. I’ve said enough. Come  up with something better to talk about the next time you visit.”</p>
<p>“…Sure.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The <em>Renegade</em> managed to slip  through the frozen checkpoint first, but the <em>Zephyr</em> was right  on its tail, with the <em>Dauntless</em> gaining on them both. Sati  opened up a channel and offered to buy a congratulatory round of  drinks for everybody, but Tinma and Asara refused (to Lyara’s  relief).</p>
<p>“I’m too young to drink anyway,”  the <em>Zephyr’s</em> pilot deadpanned. “However, I might need to  refuel. I will not be staying long, so please don’t consider this a  social call.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, suit yourself. What about  you, Miss Renegade?”</p>
<p>“We’re fine. I hate alcohol,  anyway. I never drink…wine.” She smiled sarcastically and  saluted; Sati’s ears drooped momentarily but perked up again as  Aseria took her up on the offer.</p>
<p>“I suppose we could get out and  exercise before the final stretch. I know of one person who’s  impatient to meet you!” She dragged Riene over and forced her to  wave at the video feed. Sati laughed and waved back; her tail wagged  and her heart leaped for joy. She always had been attracted to the  smart, sophisticated, quieter types, and Latoli fit that description  flawlessly.</p>
<p>“So I guess this will end up being  another date,” Chandra sighed to herself. She opened up a channel  to the <em>Stormrider</em> and studied Kaori Chuunaru for a moment. She  was right around Chandra’s age, and in spite of her stiff neck and  fanatical obedience to military rule (which Chandra considered a  turn-on anyway), she was actually a very beautiful woman. She had a  light tan from spending most of her life at the beaches on Gaia, and  had the narrow eyes and jet-black hair that made Asians so distinct.  Kaori had a sexy figure and it really showed behind her uniform.  Chandra had fallen in lust at first sight…again.</p>
<p>“And what about you?” she sang  coyly. “Will you be joining us as well? We can make it a date as  well, Captain. I really think it’s time we start acting like  friends. I’d hate to make an enemy out of someone so pretty.”  Kaori jerked back in surprise and stuttered. She was a role model to  her subordinates and an example of true loyalty and valor, but she  was also very susceptible to flirting--especially if a knockout like  Chandra was the one delivering.</p>
<p>“Um, well, you, uh…I probably  shouldn’t really…um, I mean…I can’t think of a reason  to…uh…oh, drat, I’ve lost my train of thought. It’s…really  not good for me to be socializing with you, uh…”</p>
<p>“Please?” Chandra whispered,  batting her eyelids helplessly. “Can’t you let that luxurious  hair of yours down for a moment? I would be so happy if you could. I  promise to make it worth your time.” Kaori tried to think of  another protest--she was really a shy person underneath her rigid  exterior--but fortunately, several romantics were on hand to help  deliver her to the promised land.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and do it! Nobody will  ever blame you for it! Gals like you deserve a little personal time  every once in awhile!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I think Miss Yeriman is right,”  Aseria chuckled. “You should come down and socialize. I know we’ve  had our scrapes before, but maybe we can work something out. We’ve  got a lot of convincing diplomats here with us!”</p>
<p>“Besides, your power, fuel, and  supplies are bound to be low,” Mink added. She wasn’t smiling,  but her eyes indicated she really wanted Kaori to join them all.  Chuunaru hesitated for one final moment before consigning herself to  their wishes.</p>
<p>“Just for one day, all right? And  I’m doing this for my crew, not myself.”</p>
<p>“Whatever pleases you,” Chandra  grinned. She winked at Kaori one last time before the video feed was  cut, and had the distinct pleasure of watching the other woman smile  briefly.</p>
