The Protection of Trees

Nicole watched as her sister and Alyson sat under a tree and began to 
talk. She figured that the girls probably wanted time alone so she 
decided it would be best not to disturb them. She turned to Jenn, who 
was shakily hovering over May&#39;s plaque with Kim close beside her. She 
approached the girls and looked down at the plaque. 

&quot;Did you know her?&quot; She asked with true concern in her tone. 

&quot;She was my best friend.&quot; Jenn said sniffling back the sobs.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Nicole fell silent. She placed her hands behind her back 
and gazed up at the tree, &quot;I was told that these trees protect and kept 
souls happy. I wonder if there is a tree near my mom and dad.&quot;

&quot;Your parents died?&quot; Kim asked sadly. 

&quot;Nicole.&quot; Jessica had a warning tone to her voice.

&quot;Actually...&quot; Nicole turned to look at the redhead, &quot;no...&quot; She then 
looked up at the tree again, &quot;I just wish that a tree was watching over 
them.&quot; She glanced around at the other trees, &quot;I always feel safest 
around the trees... I don&#39;t know...&quot; She shrugged then glanced over at 
her sister, &quot;Sis always told me that she could feel them watching over 
us... maybe I shouldn&#39;t believe her...&quot; 

&quot;Sis?&quot; Kim followed the girl&#39;s gaze, &quot;Alyson?&quot;

Nicole shook her head, &quot;Although I really wish she was at times. Nat is 
my real sister... though she is never around much to act like one.&quot; 

&quot;Your sister?&quot; Kim stood and stared at her blonde friend who seemed to 
be in a heated discussion, &quot;She never told me...&quot; Kim said astonished by 
the news.

Nicole blinked at Kimberly, &quot;Have you known my sister long?&quot; She asked 
curiously. 

&quot;We met a few years back.&quot; Kim nervously looked from Natalie to Nicole. 
The two looked nothing alike. Natalie was athletic with long silky 
blonde hair while this child was skinny with short black hair cut 
cleanly at the neck and across her brow. The only similarity was in the 
girls&#39; eyes, which held the same intense blue. Nicole had her eyes 
currently fixed on Kim and seemed to be sizing the girl up. 

&quot;I know you now.&quot; Nicole suddenly said, &quot;You are that girl that went 
missing after her parents were murdered.&quot; 

&quot;Murdered?&quot; Jenn stood to her feet unsure if she heard the girl 
correctly. 

Kim, however, felt her blood turn cold, &quot;Who... Who told you that?&quot; She 
nervously swallowed hard. 

&quot;Nicole!!!&quot; Jessica&#39;s warning this time came with an edge of anger, &quot;You 
know better!&quot; She walked over to the child and set a hand on the child&#39;s 
head. 

&quot;I&#39;m just telling her what Sis told me.&quot; Nicole stated, &quot;She is the girl 
Sis has been searching for, isn&#39;t she?&quot; She asked innocently blinking at 
Kim with her big eyes.  

&quot;She has?&quot; Kim looked over at the blonde to see her suddenly get to her 
feet and run away, &quot;Nat?&quot; Kim was about to go after the girl when she 
felt a small hand take her own. 

&quot;Stay...&quot; Nicole said softly, gripping tighter onto the redhead&#39;s hand, 
&quot;She is only filled with hurtful words when upset.&quot; 

Jenn knelt next to the girl, &quot;Has she hurt you before?&quot;

A smile suddenly came across the girl&#39;s face, &quot;Nope, I just said that to 
keep you here.&quot; She said, however the smile didn&#39;t stay long as the girl 
turned to watch Alyson start to stand and Kris run to the girl&#39;s side, 
&quot;Do you love my sis?&quot; Nicole asked Kim bluntly without moving her gaze 
from the two girls in the distance. 

&quot;Ummm...&quot; Kim stammered glancing from Nicole to Jenn, &quot;That is... she 
is... just my friend...&quot; 

Jenn&#39;s face turned long at the way Kim stuttered over the answer. Nicole 
was the one to voice the thoughts in Jenn&#39;s mind, &quot;Then why did you 
hesitate?&quot; She asked, then let go of the girl&#39;s hand and started towards 
Alyson, &quot;You&#39;d better not get between them or else.&quot; She let the threat 
hang in the air and she ran over to Alyson and gave the girl a hug. 

&quot;That is one scary girl.&quot; Jenn admitted once the child was out of ears 
length. 

&quot;Just ignore her.&quot; Jessica declared, &quot;She is a trouble maker. Always 
protective of her sister and Alyson.&quot; She shook her head in displeasure 
&quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m going to do with that group.&quot;

&quot;She seems nice enou-&quot; Kim started to say when she felt her strength 
slip away from her all of a sudden.

&quot;Kim?&quot; Jenn asked watching her friend sway, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t feel to good.&quot; Kim mumbled, holding her head, she started to 
slip to the ground as she felt darkness envelope her. 

&quot;KIM!?!&quot; Jenn slipped her arm around the girl to help her stand. 

&quot;Easy there...&quot; Jessica wrapped an arm around the other side of the 
redhead, &quot;You should be in bed like Amy ordered.&quot; She stated with a 
snicker. 

&quot;I... just...&quot; Kim struggled to speak. 

&quot;I know.&quot; Jessica grinned at Jenn, &quot;You just wanted to be with your 
love.&quot; 

&quot;We are not!&quot; Jenn protested with a blush as she struggled to help Kim 
to her feet only to find herself still exhausted from the past days 
events.

&quot;I&#39;m just kidding.&quot; Jessica defended worried by the anger in Jenn&#39;s 
eyes.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Alyson asked as she approached the girls and began to 
assess the situation, with Kris and Nicole followed closely behind.

&quot;She is just dizzy from the loss of blood is all.&quot; Jessica said lightly, 
&quot;We just need to get her back to bed.&quot; 

&quot;Let me help.&quot; Alyson grasped Kim&#39;s wounded arm and recoiled from it as 
if the girl&#39;s arm was on fire. She quickly took Kim by the hand instead 
and pulled the girl&#39;s sleeve back to see the set of bandages that 
covered her entire forearm and gave Jessica an intense look, &quot;What cut 
this girl?&quot; She asked sternly.

&quot;Just some glass from a mirror.&quot; Jessica replied with a shrug, &quot;Nothing 
much, however it did cut her rather deeply.&quot; 

&quot;Hold these!&quot; Alyson commanded as she dropped the apples into Nicole&#39;s 
awaiting hands, with the dagger still protruding out of them and then 
took Kimberly from the girls, &quot;Show me to her room.&quot; She lifted Kim into 
her arms as if the girl was nothing more than a small child and started 
towards the dorms with everyone following closely behind her.
