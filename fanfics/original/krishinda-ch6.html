<h1>Prophecy of Krishinda: The Kusagana Myth (part 6 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/krishinda-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Eventually after about five hours of walking, Akira, Mitsuki, Miki, 
Anju and Genzo finally reached the state of Rz&#146;oawrein, and its 
capitol, Rz&#146;oawrein city. It was a bustling merchant&#146;s town, full of 
market stalls and public displays. However the Heaven Slayers had no 
time to enjoy it. They had no idea where the next devil was, so Genzo 
and Anju suggested that they search the city for it after they got 
some rest. 
 
The others had agreed on that, seeing as how it was the best course of 
action at this time, and so they hired out four rooms at the best Inn 
in town, the Ivory Vale. 
 
Like before, Genzo, Miki and Anju all had separate rooms, and Mitsuki 
and Akira shared a room. It was already dark out now, so Mitsuki and 
Akira decided to turn in. But for some strange reason, Mitsuki and 
Akira felt very tired.
 
Mitsuki puffed up the pillow on her bed while Akira got undressed. 
This time they had individual beds, and the room in the Ivory Vale was 
much more rich and decorated then the Tsukiyo Inn. However, it was 
also much more expensive, and money had to be paid up front. 
 
After softening the plush pillow on her bed, Mitsuki tiredly climbed 
in and lazily shut her eyes.
 
&#147;Night, Akira.&#148; Mitsuki managed to utter before sleep took over. 
 
Akira smiled peacefully at her best friend. &#147;Night.&#148;
 
Akira then packed up her armour and normal clothes and placed them in 
a small pile on the chair next to her bed. Akira yawned aloud and 
slipped under the covers of her bed, letting sleep claim her.
 
**********
 
Miki&#146;s eyes adjusted harshly as she walked around a very misty, dank 
and dark forest. The large oak trees around her towered into the sky, 
owls were hooting mischievously in the night, small crows flapped in 
the far distance. Though the ground was solid, Miki felt a splash 
every time she made a step. The winter&#146;s breeze blew in a chilling 
wind, eliciting a poignant rustling from the leaves of the oak trees.
 
The Soujumah priestess had no idea as to where she was, or how she got 
there, but a cold sense of dread developed within her to think about 
the place. In a very unusual way, it felt...familiar.
 
She continued to walk around the forest, not following a precise 
course, rather going where her instincts took her.
 
Miki eventually made her way to a small house, well maintained despite 
the fact that it was in such a harsh area. 
 
Slowly and cautiously walking up to the house, Miki knocked 
surreptitiously on the door. No one answered her. Suddenly the joyous 
laughter of a child rang in her ears. Miki turned around in haste and 
looked down to see a youngster right behind her. 
 
She was short, about six or seven, had her hazelnut hair coming all 
way down to her ankles, and beamed a toothy grin at Miki, her emerald 
eyes shining brightly. 
 
Miki struggled to get this all into her head. The child before Miki 
looked *exactly* like she did when she was that child&#146;s age.
 
The youngster smiled at Miki. &#147;Hiya. I&#146;m Miki Soujumah. What&#146;s your 
name?&#148;
 
Miki blinked at that. This was she as a child... Miki kneeled down to 
face her past self at eye level, and forced a smile onto her face. 
 
&#147;Hi. My name is also Miki.&#148; She said.
 
The young Miki looked surprised for a second, but it disappeared as 
soon as it came, and looked up expectantly into the older Miki&#146;s eyes.
 
&#147;Will you play with me?&#148; The young Miki asked.
 
Miki nodded. She knew that when she was a child, she didn&#146;t have many 
friends. And she also knew that these were not the happiest years 
either. The young Miki pulled out a small red ball from under a nearby 
pile of leaves and kneeled down. Miki also kneeled down on the ground, 
rubbing a few twigs away from underneath her feet. 
 
Young Miki rolled the ball towards the older Miki, and she rolled it 
back accordingly. A cheerful laugh escaped the young girl.
 
&#147;So,&#148; The older Miki said. &#147;Why are you here all alone?&#148;
 
The young Miki&#146;s eyes darkened. &#147;I&#146;m always alone. People don&#146;t like 
me.&#148;
 
The older Miki felt a pang of nostalgia. &#147;Why?&#148;
 
&#147;That&#146;s &#146;cause my Daddy&#146;s the high priest in the Soujumah clan. I know 
they hate me &#145;cause I have to take over for my Daddy...and get 
married.&#148;
 
The older Miki rolled back the ball when it came to her. &#147;You...do not 
want to get married?&#148; 
 
As she received the ball, young Miki didn&#146;t roll it back, instead she 
looked at older Miki with a distant frown on her face. 
 
&#147;No...I don&#146;t wanna get married. I wanna be a knight.&#148; She said. 
 
The older Miki smiled inwardly. &#147;That can be dangerous.&#148;
 
Standing up, the young Miki picked up a stick and swung it around 
arrogantly. 
 
&#147;I can handle it! I can handle anything! One day I&#146;ll be a brave 
knight just like Hyudo is! I&#146;ll beat all the Tenshi-jin with one 
blow!&#148;
 
The young Miki swung her &#145;sword&#146;. &#147;POW! Like that, see?&#148;
 
Miki laughed at her younger counterpart. She had forgotten how 
immature and na&iuml;ve she was then. 
 
&#147;I think you might just pull it off, Miki.&#148;
 
**********
 
Miki twisted and writhed in her sleep. Though the dream wasn&#146;t exactly 
a bad one, a dark feeling laid within it. The Soujumah priestess 
continued to toss and turn in her sleep, unaware of the bright glow 
surrounding her...
 
**********
 
Mitsuki looked around her. She was standing on a large stone-finished 
floor, a few cracks here and there but in relatively good condition.  
It was outside, a hot summer&#146;s day in the afternoon. 
 
The only thing Mitsuki could now confirm about her situation was the 
fact that she was alone. Just as she thought about leaving, a figure 
faded into view at the edge of the stone floor. 
 
She squinted at the character, taking note of their features. Dark 
hair done up in a ponytail and slung forwards over her shoulder, sword 
and scabbard strapped to her back, arms crossed, with a shy yet 
confident smile on her face...
 
&#147;Akira!&#148; Mitsuki yelled happily.
 
The young healer ran over to her friend instantly, and breathed a sigh 
of warm relief. Akira said nothing as Mitsuki ran up to her. 
 
&#147;Akira, I&#146;m so glad you&#146;re here. Where are we?&#148;
 
The daughter of Hyudo did not say anything to Mitsuki; rather she 
looked at the blonde with a look of condescension. 
 
It made Mitsuki nervous. &#147;Akira...?&#148;
 
&#147;Don&#146;t even speak my name!&#148; Akira yelled.
 
Mitsuki&#146;s eyes widened and she backed off slowly. She had never heard 
Akira yell at anyone, least of all her.
 
&#147;...Akira, what&#146;s wrong? What&#146;s the matter with you?&#148; Mitsuki said, a 
fragile voice becoming even more timid.
 
Akira, or what seemed to be Akira spat scornfully in Mitsuki&#146;s face. 
The young healer gasped in shock and disgust, scrubbing the saliva off 
of her face quickly.
 
Akira grinned at a now teary eyed Mitsuki. &#147;Don&#146;t cry you little runt. 
Just get out of my face. How dare you think things like that about 
me?&#148;
 
Mitsuki looked confused. &#147;What?&#148;
 
&#147;Don&#146;t play dumb you pervert. I know how you think about me. You say 
that you love me and that you wanna protect me...makes me wretch.&#148;
 
Mitsuki&#146;s tears started to spill. &#147;Akira...please...I-&#148;
 
Mitsuki&#146;s pleas where silenced when Akira viciously slapped her in the 
face. The blonde yelped and fell to her knees, holding a bright red 
cheek doused in Akira&#146;s spittle. Akira grinned again as Mitsuki cried 
openly. 
 
&#147;Did you ever believe that I could love a whining little brat like 
you? Did you?!&#148; 
 
Akira was now yelling straight at Mitsuki&#146;s face, holding her arms in 
place very tightly and the girl in her grip simply cringed in fear. 
Mitsuki was so frightened. She loved Akira with every piece of her 
soul, and now...
 
{No, this can&#146;t be real...my Akira would never hurt me like this!} 
Mitsuki thought.  
 
&#147;Answer me you sick freak! I said answer me!&#148; Akira yelled.
 
Mitsuki continued to cry, till Akira dragged her onto her feet. She 
then drew her sword, a darker version of the Dragon-edge, and glared 
hatefully at Mitsuki. Mitsuki tensed up as the sword was placed 
dangerously close to her throat. 
 
&#147;I could kill you right now, you know. I could slice off your head 
faster then lightning...I could disembowel you here and now...but I 
want you suffer...&#148;
 
Akira shoved Mitsuki away, sheathed Dragon-edge, and turned her back 
to Mitsuki.
 
&#147;Get away from me. I want you live out your pathetic little life 
knowing how much I despise you. And that no matter what you do...I 
will never love you...&#148;
 
Mitsuki wept painfully as Akira walked away from her, and she vanished 
of into the distance, leaving a horrified and heartbroken Mitsuki in 
her wake.  
 
**********
 
Mitsuki tossed in her bed, tears streaming down her face, and a very 
unusual glow surrounding her body...
 
**********
 
Akira was in a barren and quiet place with nothing around her, no 
sound and no view. A total blank. Suddenly and image of Mitsuki popped 
in front of her. The young knight beamed happily, running up and 
hugging her best friend.
 
&#147;Mitsuki! Are you okay? I was worried about you.&#148;
 
Mitsuki only looked confused, and pushed Akira away gently. 
 
&#147;Why?&#148; Mitsuki asked blankly.
 
This time, Akira was the one to be confused. Mitsuki and Akira always 
worried about each other. They were such close friends. Mitsuki should 
have known that without even asking.
 
&#147;I always worry about you. You know that.&#148; Akira said.
 
Mitsuki still looked confused. &#147;But...why?&#148;
 
&#147;We&#146;re friends, Mitsuki. I care about you.&#148; 
 
Mitsuki stepped back for a second, and still looked at Mitsuki with 
the most bewildered expression on her face. Akira stepped forwards to 
meet with Mitsuki, but the blonde only stepped back accordingly.
 
&#147;But it&#146;s not your place to watch after me. And we are not friends.&#148;
 
Akira&#146;s eyes widened. &#147;What are you talking about? You&#146;re my best 
friend, Mitsuki!&#148;
 
A warm smile crossed Mitsuki&#146;s lips, and Akira felt better for that, 
but she didn&#146;t feel good about what Mitsuki said next. 
 
&#147;I&#146;m...sorry miss, I am sure you&#146;re a nice girl and everything, but I 
don&#146;t even know you...&#148; Mitsuki said.
 
It was then that Akira officially became worried. &#147;Mitsuki...please. 
This is crazy. You&#146;ve been my best friend for the past four years. We 
do everything together, you mean everything to me...&#148;
 
Mitsuki sweat-dropped and stepped back again.
 
&#147;Whoa. Okay, you&#146;re actually starting to scare me a little. I don&#146;t 
know how you know my name, but the joke&#146;s over.&#148; 
 
Akira suddenly became desperate. &#147;Listen to me, Mitsuki. We are best 
friends. I do not know why you are doing this, I just want it to 
stop.&#148;
 
Mitsuki actually felt scared now. She had no idea who this girl was, 
and was starting to think that she might do something rash. Mitsuki 
caringly (but cautiously) put her hand on Akira&#146;s shoulder, and gave 
the young knight a small smile. 
 
&#147;Look, you&#146;ve probably got me confused with someone else. I&#146;m sorry 
for that, but you have to understand the fact that I&#146;ve never met you 
before. It&#146;s sweet that you care so much for this other Mitsuki, but I 
am not her, all right?&#148;
 
It hurt for Mitsuki to say that to her. Mitsuki would never say that 
to her. They were *best* friends.
 
Akira&#146;s eyes glazed over. &#147;Mitsuki...&#148;
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry miss, but I have to go. I&#146;m gonna meet,&#148; Mitsuki sighed 
breathlessly. &#147;...Kai...&#148;
Akira snapped back into focus when she heard that name. But what 
irritated Akira was the way Mitsuki said his name...
 
&#147;But I thought you said that you didn&#146;t love Kai!&#148; Akira yelled.
 
Mitsuki looked back at Akira and scowled at her for claiming such a 
ridiculous notion.
 
&#147;Are you insane? I&#146;ve always loved Kai! He&#146;s one of the cutest guys in 
Daitoshi city. Plus he&#146;s smart, funny, and my grandfather likes him 
too. We&#146;re perfect for each other.&#148; Mitsuki said.
 
The young knight felt her heart fall. This...wasn&#146;t happening. Mitsuki 
had said that she did not love Kai, that Genzo was making her marry 
him. Akira closed her eyes for a second. She just had to get a grip on 
reality. There was no way that Mitsuki loved Kai...
 
As soon as Akira opened her eyes, Mitsuki was gone. Now there was only 
a tall man. Muscular yet slender, gold armour polished to a eye 
blinding sheen, his long dark grey hair done up into a pony tail and 
draped forwards over his shoulder, a long sword strapped to his back, 
and a cocky leer framing his face.
 
Akira stood in awe of this man&#146;s lion-like grace and haughty nature. 
And she recognized who this was...her father,
 
Hyudo Kusagana.
 
Hyudo let out is proud trademark laugh. &#147;Well, well, well. Is this 
shining herald of my legacy?&#148;
 
Akira gasped. &#147;Father...I-&#147;
 
&#147;Do you really consider yourself to be a knight? You coward, you&#146;re 
not even brave enough to admit what your heart really wants. You don&#146;t 
deserve to wield that sword, or carry on my name, little girl.&#148;
 
Akira fell to her knees in utter sorrow. She had long suspected that 
her father would not be pleased with her, that she could not live up 
to his expectations, but when it was said...
 
The dark haired girl had to shut her eyes tightly to prevent the tears 
from spilling. Hyudo caught on though.
 
&#147;Oh, don&#146;t give me that,&#148; The legendary knight said. &#147;Grow up...&#148;
 
Akira kept her eyes closed, but spoke out to Hyudo. &#147;I have done 
everything...in my power...to be worthy of the name Kusagana...&#148;
 
Hyudo grinned. &#147;Is that so?&#148;
 
&#147;Yes...&#148;
 
Hyudo&#146;s grin then faded. &#147;Lies. You are telling me that you worthy of 
my name, but you&#146;re bawling like an infant at my feet.&#148;
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry father...I-&#147;
 
&#147;If you&#146;re sorry, then get up off your knees and act like a warrior 
who deserves the name, Kusagana!&#148; Hyudo roared.
 
It was then that Akira realized that Hyudo was right. Whining and 
crying about it would not do any good she had to stand her ground. She 
*was* a Kusagana, and she was going to prove it. 
 
The scenery behind them changed from a barren void, to a glistening 
field of green decorated with beautiful cherry blossom trees and 
sparkling springs of water, the whole place vibrant and full of life. 
 
Akira then pulled herself off of the floor, and wiped away the tears 
that were forming around her eyes. Steely, the young knight walked up 
to the image of her father, staring him down, meeting his probing gaze 
inch for inch.
 
&#147;Now,&#148; Hyudo said. &#147;Prove to me that you are my daughter. Wield the 
Dragon-edge with all your power and attest the belief that you carry 
our family&#146;s noble blood.&#148;
 
Akira drew the Dragon-edge and stared at Hyudo. &#147;Yes father...I&#146;ll 
make you proud. By destroying all of the six devils.&#148;
 
**********
 
Akira awoke from her dream with a start. It felt like some sort of 
powerful force was trying to keep her asleep. Then she got worried. 
Whatever happened to her was happening the others. Akira looked over 
at Mitsuki. She was still asleep, just tossing around a bit, however 
she did have a strange aura surrounding her. 
 
Akira stood up quickly and kneeled next to Mitsuki&#146;s bed. On closer 
inspection, it was revealed that Mitsuki was crying in her sleep. 
 
The young knight didn&#146;t know why she was crying but she hoped that it 
would go away. After brushing Mitsuki&#146;s tears away, Akira blushed and 
planted a sweet kiss on Mitsuki&#146;s cheek.
 
Subsequent to that, Akira quickly put on her armour and strapped the 
Dragon-edge over her back. She didn&#146;t know what exactly was doing 
this, but she was pretty sure it was the work of a devil.
 
**********
 
Akira was running through the path towards the old hut where the 
fortune-teller lived. Akira could think of nothing else that would 
have affected the team so badly. None of the others could wake up from 
the slumber that they were in, so she decided to confront the old hag 
alone. That might have been a mistake, but right now she had no 
choice. 
 
Akira ran across the path, and over the horizon of the Kaunikauna 
plains, she saw the shack of the old woman. The old hag, who was still 
sitting on her wooden chair, sneered grimly as Akira approached her.
 
Akira slowed to a stop, and walked up to the old woman slowly. The old 
hag let out a shrill laugh at the young knight.
 
&#147;So, little girl, you managed to break free of the spell?&#148;
 
Akira drew Dragon-edge and pointed it threateningly at the old hag.
 
&#147;You better release my friends you shrivelled up old prune. Or I&#146;ll 
cut you open a new blow hole.&#148;
 
&#147;Is that so? The old hag said. &#147;When I get all the energy I need from 
your friends, there won&#146;t be anything left to save. In fact I already 
have enough to restore my youth and my powers...&#148;
 
Akira smiled. &#147;Who says I won&#146;t just kill you now?&#148;
 
&#147;Pretty good question...&#148;
 
The old hag&#146;s eyes flashed a deep scarlet, and a furious wind blew 
across the plains. Akira stepped back to cover her eyes, and the old 
hag&#146;s body rose into the air, the wind playing menacingly with her 
clothes and hair. Unexpectedly, a bright light surrounded the hag&#146;s 
body, and the old woman shrieked in delight as she felt her powers 
coming back, the signs of aging fading away. Her body then descended 
to the ground, and Akira opened one of her eyes enough just to look at 
her.
 
Gone were the wrinkles and bony limbs of the woman, her body was now 
young and powerful, her hair, now a dark blue was tossing vehemently 
in the wind. What remained was the voluptuous body of star, yet her 
powers were dark...and evil.
 
&#147;Now my child, what were you saying?&#148; said the witch, her voice 
clearly younger and smoother then it was before. 
 
Akira&#146;s eyes widened when she took a *good* look at her...
 
&#147;You *are* the forth devil!&#148; Akira shouted. 
 
 
The wind around them settled down, but the devils aura remained 
strong. The forth devil&#146;s eyes lit up, and she raised her palm into 
the air.
 
&#147;Yes, that&#146;s right. And unfortunately for you, I am not as brainless 
as my brother was!&#148;
 
A powerful bolt of energy shot out of the forth devil&#146;s hand, and 
Akira expressly dove onto the ground to avoid it. The devil smirked 
and shot more blasts at Akira, the young knight having to tumble her 
way past the energy balls. 
 
Akira slid away from the blasts and managed to get back on her feet. 
The dark haired girl gathered up her strength and filled her body with 
the essence of Mana-Ki.
 
The Dragon-edge began to glow a pale sapphire, energy surrounding the 
blade with a feral will, almost comparable to lust. Akira&#146;s eyes 
broadened as she raised her sword into the air, preparing for *that* 
attack...
 
&#147;Kyoretsuzan!&#148; 
 
Akira yelled out her attack and a magnificent wave of spirit energy 
left the sword it clung so lovingly to, and threw itself towards the 
forth devil. The devil smirked evilly, then faded into a bleak mist.
 
Akira gasped as the Kyoretsuzan wave passed straight through the 
fourth devil, and blew up the old shack that the forth devil had been 
living in.      
 
Cinders and charred pieces of wood were tossed around the ground, and 
the hut&#146;s remains were set alight. 
 
The forth devil smiled at a now worried Akira.
 
&#147;What&#146;s wrong, little girl? Your trump card came up short did it? 
Well, not to worry, you can have all the time you need to improve your 
tactics. In the next life...&#148;    
 
Akira gritted her teeth and held firm. She would not lose; she would 
find another way. The forth devil fired again at Akira, and the young 
girl had to run to avoid the blasts. 
 
The forth devil continued to fire, following Akira&#146;s every movements. 
Until one shot came very close to Akira&#146;s ankle, and it was enough to 
make her trip up. Akira cursed as she fell to the ground. 
 
Another energy attack followed the previous one. The blast rammed 
smack bang into the middle of Akira&#146;s stomach, and the young knight 
was thrown across the dirt. 
 
&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!&#148; The forth devil laughed. &#147;Now you&#146;re mine!&#148;
 
Akira weakly stood up, steadying herself with the Dragon-edge, and she 
narrowed her eyes at the devil. Abruptly, Akira became filled with 
images of her father, Mitsuki, Genzo, Miki and Anju. She had to do 
this for them...
 
&#147;My father was right,&#148; Akira started. &#147;I have been doubting myself, 
and not trusting in my skills. Well no more. If I am to defeat the 
devils, honour my father and protect Mitsuki, then I must have faith 
in the power that lies within me. I have Kusagana blood running 
through my veins... and as long I stand and breathe, nothing will stop 
me...&#148; 
 
The forth devil laughed again. &#147;My dear, you can&#146;t even hurt me!&#148;
 
Akira smiled, almost conceitedly. &#147;Oh yeah, well try and fire one of 
those power balls you keep shooting at me again. I dare you...&#148;
 
&#147;Foolish girl. But if you want your destruction, I&#146;d be more than 
happy to give it to you.&#148;
 
Just as she was asked, the second devil fired an additional blast at 
Akira. The young knight held her ground, and quickly deflected the 
ball with her sword. The shot was sent careening back to the forth 
devil, and she screamed in agony as the flare drilled into her. 
 
Her eyes expanded significantly, and the forth devil doubled over in 
pain, wheezing and gasping for breath, obviously winded. Then the 
devil saw nothing but red as Akira&#146;s sword sliced her in two.</pre>
