Central Courtyard, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

Overall, this was the last day of Ten Sekai Sentou Kyousou. All matches 
had been decided. Setsuya Seisuji had faced Aarin Highland in the final 
round of the tournament. Setsuya had come out of that fight as the 
winner of both the match and of whole shebang. Now he was in line for a 
nice little cash sum of 800,000 credits. After the bonus match was 
settled. Of course, Setsuya didn&#39;t really care about the money. Even 
though it would last him a year with no work. All he cared about now was 
the freedom of Lin-Lin. He was sure that she was here somewhere. So 
while Setsuya kept Zephaniah busy up on the courtyard, Aarin and Ingrid 
would go free Lin-Lin themselves. They would then sneak out of the 
castle and wait for Setsuya at South Beach. After defeating Zephaniah; 
he would join them and the four of them would escape from the Island of 
Creation. That was the plan. The only hope was that it would work. 
Hopefully Aarin and Ingrid would run into no trouble whilst looking for 
Lin-Lin. Because Setsuya had no idea just how long this fight would be 
with Zephaniah. Or how long it would be until he showed himself. 

Setsuya stood in the centre of the stone courtyard of Neuschwanstein 
Castle. It was exactly the place that he expected this last match to be. 
It was within the boundaries of the main compound so troops from the 
Shougatsu could turn up whenever they wanted. This fight was probably 
being monitored too. But it seemed like a decent place to deal with the 
battle between himself and Zephaniah. The Courtyard of Neuschwanstein 
Castle was not built with the same zeal as other parts of the Castle. It 
was 110x108 metres in size. It was also kept deliberately antiquated to 
give off that aging look. From the slit openings at the sides of those 
towering stone walls to the simple fact that it was open-aired. Setsuya 
could look up and see that bright morning sun blazing along the clear 
blue sky. A bright day. Perfect for fighting. And though minutes soon 
passed by; Zephaniah finally made an appearance on the other side of 
that large courtyard. 

The large wooden doors, bolted with iron, swung open with a loud ominous 
creak to reveal the man. But he was not dressed in the same garbs as 
when Setsuya had first seen him. Zephaniah had abandoned those business 
suits for full-fledged armour. His legs were swathed with a smooth dark 
purple armour, just as his chest and left arm were. His right arm was 
different. It was made of a different piece of armour. One that had 
wires attaching the large arm gauntlet to the Great Knight&#39;s actual arm. 
It didn&#39;t stand out much but it was different from the rest of his 
plates of armour. His head was enswathed with a helmet, too. The visor 
was a rather thin slit that just about allowed sight around them. 
Setsuya blinked. That suit of armour Zephaniah was wearing did not look 
very comfortable; but surely gave him great defence against Setsuya&#39;s 
attacks. It looked like something that a Knight would have worn into 
battle during the Middle Ages. But with the kind of polish and care in 
detail that would have come to a suit of armour built in this day and 
age. But even more alarming than that was the weapon that Zephaniah was 
carrying. A rather large sword. It was made with a thick black metal 
which Setsuya could not identify. It had runic symbols along the blade. 
And possessed a kind of aura that was threatening in nature. Which 
contributed to that powerful but enormously dark aura that Zephaniah was 
giving off. The sword was almost perfect for him. And from looking at 
it; Setsuya got the distinct and accurate impression that the blade in 
Zephaniah&#39;s hands was the Shadow Edge, the last and most destructive of 
the Four Sacred Swords.

The Great Knight Zephaniah walked forwards, towards Setsuya, quite 
slowly. Taking the time to evaluate this man called Setsuya Seisuji. He 
stopped walking when he reached within twenty metres of the younger 
fighter. The tip of the Shadow Edge touched upon the flagstones of the 
courtyard. 

&quot;You are... Setsuya Seisuji...?&quot; He questioned.

The boy nodded. &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s me. And you must be &#145;Mr. Zephaniah&#39;, the 
leader of the Shougatsu Financial Group and the guy who arraigned this 
little shindig you called Ten Sekai Sentou Kyousou.&quot;

&quot;Correct,&quot; The English Swordmaster said, &quot;I did engineer this 
tournament. And you are its winner. Congratulations. You will be awarded 
with the prize money (800,000) after this additional fight is 
concluded.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; And although Setsuya&#39;s face was smiling, his thoughts did not 
follow it, {Not that I give a damn about the prize money or the 
tournament. The only thing I came here for was to free Lin-Lin. And 
while I keep you occupied up here, Aarin will go rescue her for me.}

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Aarin&#39;s Room, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

&quot;Let me get this straight. You say that the Shougatsu Financial Group, 
the blokes who hosted this tournament, are in reality a super-powerful 
conglomerate with aspirations that could bring serious problems to the 
world? ... I don&#39;t believe a word of it.&quot;

Aarin sighed, holding his forehead in his hand. Morning had come quickly 
after the Final match yesterday. It was at this point that they had to 
be swift. By now the additional fight between Setsuya and Zephaniah was 
getting underway. He had to act fast and find Lin-Lin before this fight 
ended. It was going to be difficult though. For one thing; Aarin did not 
know what Lin-Lin looked like. He had been given a brief description of 
her before Setsuya left for the courtyard, and he knew that she was 
Chinese, but that was it. And one more glaring problem was Ingrid. The 
girl had been in the dark about the Shougatsu until now. But if he were 
going to be able to protect her then Aarin had to be honest about the 
issue. Which meant spilling the beans on his sister. But she did not 
seem to be swallowing those beans very well. 

This was the last thing they needed. &quot;...Ingrid. It might sound a little 
crazy, but I assure you that this is no joke. The Shougatsu Financial 
Group are dangerous and they have to be stopped. But first things first. 
We have to help Setsuya find his friend and then leave the Island of 
Creation.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; It wasn&#39;t like she had much will to stay here, &quot;Fine. But I 
think you&#39;re really wrong about the Shougatsu. They have shown us 
nothing respect since we came here. Which the way it should be. We do 
belong to the Highland Family, after all.&quot;

Aarin shook his head again and gripped Ingrid by the wrist. &quot;Save the 
family pride for another day. Right now we really have to move.&quot;

But both their attentions were robbed in the instant that Aarin said 
that. The door at the other side of the room burst open. It broke off 
the hinges with a rough blow from the other side. And Aarin and Ingrid 
could see why. Four hulking soldiers, dressed in the brown, green and 
black of army combat camouflage; stood in front of the doorway. One of 
them had his boot raised. He was the one who had kicked down the door, 
obviously. The four burly men marched into Aarin&#39;s living quarters and 
narrowed down on the Highland siblings.

&quot;You!&quot; One soldier shouted, &quot;Aarin and Ingrid Highland! Owners of both 
Wind Soul and the Lightning Tooth! Stand down and hand over both of the 
swords now! Or we will be forced to take action!&quot; 

Ingrid scowled, gripping the hilt of the Lightning Tooth. &quot;How dare you 
talk to me like that!? Do you have any idea of who you are speaking to, 
you foul mouthed ruffian?! Talk to me like that again and I&#39;ll castrate 
you!&quot;

One of the soldiers to the left cracked his knuckles. &quot;That cute little 
chick over there&#39;s got some pair of balls on her! I like a woman with 
spunk. Heh, heh, heh.&quot;

Ingrid scowled at them and looked over at Aarin. &quot;...Can I deal with 
this?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Aarin heaved a sigh. He really wanted to avoid any needless 
conflict until Lin-Lin and Setsuya were safely out of harm&#39;s way. But 
Ingrid would never be able to tolerate men who disrespected her like 
that anyway, &quot;Just be quick about it, please.&quot;

Not that she wanted to waste great deals of energy on these crude 
bastards, either. Ingrid gave another scowl at the quartet of un-armed 
soldiers and withdrew Lightning Tooth. The one at the back stepped away 
from the other three after seeing this. But the other three held their 
ground. Apparently they were wearing some kind of armour under those 
clothes that protected them from weapons like swords. But Ingrid highly 
doubted that these idiots had compensated for the magical properties of 
her blade. The youngest of the Highland Family pulled her sword out and 
pointed it straight for the band of soldiers at the doorway. They all 
froze in place as Ingrid gave a deeper grip of the Lightning Tooth. And 
that grip gave way to a bright sapphire glow enfolding the blade. 

&quot;You should never piss off a Highland woman,&quot; Ingrid claimed, &quot;Thunder 
Breaker!&quot;

The Lightning Tooth shot out a thin but sharply aimed beam of blue 
energy at the guard at the front of the room. His body jerked and his 
mouth screamed with the pain as he was brutally electrocuted by the 
sword of the Highland girl. The beam that attacked him broke off at the 
point of contact into three other small lightning beams. Each of those 
beams went to one of the three other soldiers and gave them the same 
shock treatment as their friend. To Ingrid, it served them right. Once 
smoke began to rise from the four of them, she then lowered the 
Lightning Tooth and relinquished the Thunder Breaker Magic Attack. The 
four soldiers all collapsed and passed out, their clothes smoking from 
the thunder magic. 

And Ingrid smiled at the results. &quot;Stupid men. Why are all the 
Muscleheads so brainless?&quot;

Aarin stepped over them. &quot;Forget that right now. We have to get down to 
the holding cells on the bottom floor and free the Chinese girl. Come 
Ingrid, we must be quick about this.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Central Courtyard, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

Setsuya kept his hand poised on the hilt of the Fire Cutter. He could 
not attack recklessly. And truth be told he needed to drag this fight 
out. The longer he spent fighting Zephaniah,  the more time Aarin had in 
freeing Lin-Lin. But even more than that; he was intrigued by the aura 
of Zephaniah. His aura was invisible to the naked eye, but Setsuya&#39;s 
mind eye could see it without fail. It was bright emerald. The spirit of 
the Great Knight was quiet but surprising forceful. A kind of aura that 
did not come to many people easily. Because of this Setsuya was taking 
great caution in how he fought this guy. He might have been the leader 
of the Shougatsu but that did not mean that he was harmless. Zephaniah 
stood across from him with the Shadow Edge at hand. He was ready for 
battle. But was taking a defensive posture. Something that Setsuya might 
have predicted earlier, considering how heavy all that armour looked. 

&quot;I have to look for a weakness,&quot; The Japanese man said to himself, &quot;That 
sword does not look like the kind you can swing around very easily. Then 
an aerial assault might be the best way to feel this guy out and see 
what he&#39;s made of.&quot;

And so that was the plan. Setsuya withdrew Fire Cutter from the sheath 
at his waist. With it now freed into view, he jumped upwards. Dust blew 
away from his feet as he leapt skywards off the stone of the courtyard. 
While moving mid-jump, he rotated his body forwards while grabbing the 
Fire Cutter with his free hand. Zephaniah looked up from behind that 
clunking helmet of his. A double handed from above? Nothing couldn&#39;t 
handle after his training. Zephaniah focused his attentions on the arm 
to his right. The wires that attached the armoured gauntlet to his arm 
began to bulge. But not with the electricity. But the power of magic. 
And it worked along with the brainwaves of the one using it. That was 
Zephaniah in this case. With one mighty swing he lifted that heavy 
Shadow Edge blade and brought it up evenly to block. Setsuya and the 
Fire Cutter were deflected by it. He jumped back in confusion and landed 
in a crouched position, Setsuya&#39;s boots skidding over the stones of the 
courtyard floor. It was amazing. How was this Zephaniah character so 
easily able to block an aerial attack like that? Especially with all 
that armour?

He wasn&#39;t going to ask his opponent. It didn&#39;t seem that the C.E.O of 
the Shougatsu was likely to divulge his secrets to Setsuya. At any rate 
it meant that this fight would not be as predictable as Setsuya might 
have originally believed. And the real money-maker here was the Shadow 
Edge. One of the Four Sacred Swords and according to his Dad, Keijiro, 
that one was the most dangerous. Setsuya pulled Fire Cutter back behind 
him and began to charge Zephaniah again. A frontal assault might not be 
the best course of action against this guy but Setsuya needed to drag 
this fight along anyway. The Japanese fighter inched his way across the 
gap between himself and the Englishman and tilted his body to one side 
of himself. A full body slash came afterwards as the Fire Cutter swerved 
around his side and at Zephaniah. The older man did not shrink from 
this. He brought up his right arm, the one protected by that powered 
arm-gauntlet; and deflected the slash with the back of his steel covered 
hand. The Fire Cutter was batted away like nothing at all, leaving 
Setsuya more than open for a counter-attack. Zephaniah hoisted Shadow 
Edge into the air, this time with only one arm, and slashed downwards. 
The tip of the mighty sword brutally cut through the fabric of Setsuya&#39;s 
white undershirt and sliced open a shallow gash. Setsuya grunted hard 
from it and stepped backwards, blood spurting from his chest into the 
air. The young man gripped his chest and closed an eye. He had been cut 
already? Even more than that...

Setsuya could not help but ask the question. &quot;How the hell were... you 
able to... block Fire Cutter with your hand like that...?!&quot; 

Zephaniah lowered the Shadow Edge and pulled up his right arm, 
brandishing the large arm-gauntlet that had been wrapped around it. 
&quot;Just one of the many fascinating creations of my company. It is called 
the Zunahme Macht Arm. Not only does it increase my physical strength 
but it also allows me to better wield the Shadow Edge. Almost as if it 
were weightless. So you see... I am more prepared for this fight than 
you can imagine.&quot;

&quot;Using magical enhancers?&quot; Setsuya grinned at him, clutching the wound 
at his chest which was staining his white shirt with a dark pink colour, 
&quot;Afraid to face me without them? Or too afraid to trust in your own 
abilities?&quot;

&quot;Silence!&quot; Zephaniah growled sharply and rushed forwards. Faster than 
Setsuya would have thought he could move with all that armour over his 
lithely muscled body. With great urgency; Setsuya blocked the descending 
blow with a horizontal parry. But when their swords locked with each 
other he realized what a mistake that had been. Setsuya shut one of his 
eyes and gripped the handle of the Fire Cutter with both hands. 
Zephaniah actually was stronger than an average man was with that 
power-gauntlet. It took all of Setsuya&#39;s strength just to hold him at 
bay. The younger man held his ground as best he could. But it was 
obvious at this point that the Great Knight was stronger than he was. 
His brown boots nudged back a bit out of no wish of Setsuya&#39;s. And the 
veins of his body started throbbing from the force he was using to hold 
back Zephaniah and his Shadow Edge. He could not keep that up forever. 
He had to get out of that situation. The Yuuga Fighter instilled one 
last push of force into the sword lock. Then his whole body phased back 
from it towards the ground. He tumbled down and backwards until his head 
was about to hit floor level. Setsuya then quickly pressed his hands 
behind him and rolled backwards as best he could. The Shadow Edge came 
down seconds later and smashed the ground where Setsuya had once stood. 
The Japanese youth rolled away until he was far enough to avoid a follow 
up attack. At a distance of about sixteen or so metres. And so he stood 
back up and dragged Fire Cutter into a defensive two-handed position. 
Regardless of the distance between the two of them. 

This Zephaniah was no joke. Even without the Zunahme Macht Arm, Setsuya 
knew that this man had a physical edge over him. The only battle 
advantage Setsuya had was speed. The leader of the Shougatsu was swifter 
than most in that armour; but still rather slow with comparison to 
Setsuya. Which meant that he would have to use this difference in 
motility to his advantage during the fight. For now, Setsuya could not 
win a full-on sword clash battle. He had to focus on long range. The 
young man was just about to attempt something along those lines when 
Zephaniah spoke up.

&quot;Pitiful,&quot; He said mockingly, &quot;Are you really the winner of my 
tournament? The great wielder of the Fire Cutter? You attack me like a 
novice.&quot;

Setsuya&#39;s face twisted in anger. &quot;I&#39;m not gonna take any crap from you! 
You know full well why I&#39;m here! Your heavy-handed cronies attacked a 
helpless village and kidnapped a girl that was no match for you! What 
kind of human beings would do something like that?&quot;

Zephaniah smiled (though Setsuya couldn&#39;t see it thanks to the helmet). 
&quot;So I was right in my first belief. You are not here for the tournament 
at all. But to reclaim the girl my troops captured as a bargaining chip 
for the Fire Cutter. You may rest assured in the knowledge that I have 
no use for that tiny insignificant insect. I merely could not allow a 
hick village of China to have possession of that blade you now hold. 
Because it is far too essential to my overall plans.&quot; 

Setsuya&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;...And just what in the hell does that 
mean...?&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kuji Bay (Eastside), Kuji, Neo-Japan

The last time Ayame and Julia had come to Kuji Bay, the Omi-Aorta had 
sustained some slight damage. It was to be expected after the strength 
of Ras es-Shamrah. It was no ordinary being that was for sure. But this 
time Ras made no appearance. Ayame had taken more rubbing acid to 
Nobunaga the previous night just to make sure that if they were attacked 
on their way to the bay, she would be ready for anything. But no attack 
came. After leaving the Sugano Warehouse last night, the two of them 
went to a restaurant to eat. Then immediately began work on getting to 
Kuji Bay. They prepared themselves and left for their apartment building 
(which was untouched by the Shougatsu) then gathered up all their stuff. 
They had only been living in Kuji for three months so there wasn&#39;t much 
to take. They also took some of Simon&#39;s valuables, to keep the Shougatsu 
from tracking them and to lay rest with the body when the time came for 
his funeral in Scotland. 

Once they had gotten their things in order, Megumi was the next issue. 
She had been put into storage when Julia and Simon had decided to wait 
it out in Kuji, so, Ayame hadn&#39;t ridden her in a while. The two girls 
went straight to the Westside of the town and picked up Ayame&#39;s 
treasured bike (something she apparently could not live without) then 
began making their way for Kuji. There was still the issue of Ayame&#39;s 
apartment in Nagoya, but she had friends around that city, she could 
always ask one of them to ship her items to Julia&#39;s Scottish home. 

By the early afternoon, Ayame and Julia had made it back to the bay. 
Their items were fully packed and ready to be loaded onto the ship, 
which was carried out by the handlers that were dotted around the port. 
As all the others (whom had had their trip delayed thanks to Ras) 
gathered up around the bay facing the Omi-Aorta. The small iron paths 
that were spread out from the doors into the ship finally touched the 
floor of the port and allowed the travellers to finally enter. In the 
middle of those crowds were Ayame and Julia, far closer now, Julia&#39;s 
left hand interlocked with Ayame&#39;s right. When the former Dark Katana 
felt Julia&#39;s grip tighten, she cast a look at the British Beauty. She 
had a nervous look on her face. Ayame couldn&#39;t quite understand this, 
after all she was finally going home. But then she remembered the more 
important fact. Simon had been killed here. It was natural that she 
would feel a bit ill at ease from staying here.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Ayame said soothingly, &quot;Everything&#39;s gonna be okay, alright? Ras 
is gone and all we have to look to now is the future.&quot;

Julia nodded silently. Ayame was right, things would be better from now 
on. And so they followed the crowds as they entered the ship white iron 
ship via the pathways. While all the luggage of all the passengers was 
loaded along with them, Ayame and Julia made their way to their 
particular cabin in the ship. They had rearranged their tickets after 
the death of Simon so they could share a cabin in this case. Originally 
done for Julia&#39;s protection; now they saw it more as an opportunity to 
be closer in a comfortable light. And a good fifteen minutes later the 
ship was setting sail. Ayame and Julia walked over to the glass 
portholes of their room and watched as all the remaining people by the 
bay waved them off. Ayame soaked up what this finally meant. She was 
leaving Neo-Japan. It was her home, the place of her making. But she 
could find a better life with Julia. She was sure of it. 

Julia turned to Ayame as she looked out of her respective window. &quot;Are 
you going to miss this place?&quot;

&quot;...I suppose so,&quot; She replied, &quot;Neo-Japan has always been special to 
me. It was one of the first nations to feel the weight of the Safe Zone 
Project, so it&#39;s probably one of the better places in the world to live 
right now. But I can&#39;t stay here. Because... there&#39;s one thing that this 
place doesn&#39;t have.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Julia asked.

And Ayame beamed a little smile at her. &quot;You. It doesn&#39;t have you. I 
thought I could handle the idea of losing you, but as it turns out, I 
can&#39;t.&quot;

It made Julia&#39;s knees weak to hear Ayame talking like that. She was such 
a strong-willed person but unusually able to express her feelings. Very 
well in fact. Most people that Julia had known to be strong of mind were 
naturally weak at heart. Or at least in presenting the feelings that the 
heart held. But Ayame wasn&#39;t like that. When in the right position, she 
had no qualms about speaking her heart&#39;s truths. It was an endearing 
quality for Julia in every possible way. The Scottish girl stepped over 
to her lover and lowered her head onto the slightly taller girl&#39;s 
shoulder, wrapping both of her arms around one of Ayame&#39;s own.

&quot;You don&#39;t ever have to worry about losing me,&quot; Julia spoke softly, &quot;I&#39;m 
always going to be with you now. Forever.&quot;

But that simple moment of affection was cut short... by the now familiar 
sound of a scream. &quot;AAAAAGGGGGHHHH!&quot;

Both Ayame and Julia froze in place as they heard screams from up above. 
The main deck most likely. Something was going on up there. And the 
feminine scream they heard in that instant was soon joined by five 
others. Ayame pressed her hand downwards and gripped at the hilt of 
Nobunaga. She had no idea what was going on but she had to check it out 
for Julia&#39;s sake. The Neo-Japanese woman nodded to Julia to let her know 
that everything would be okay. But for now she had to check out what was 
going on. Ayame then ran straight to the door and out into the white 
steel corridor. She swung through the pathway and dashed up the stairs, 
and a swarm of tourists/travellers ran past her to get inside the ship. 
Before she moved on she took a look at all of them. Around twenty people 
and they were all terrified. But of what? Ayame couldn&#39;t wait any longer 
to find out. She ran up the steps and climbed the stairs until she 
reached the surface level. Ayame kicked open the metal door that secured 
it and strode out onto the deck. People were running like wild fire down 
her side of the ship and ran right past her to get inside. Ayame barged 
past them and fought her way into the direction they were coming from. 
Towards the far end of the Omi-Aorta was a being of bulky stature. And 
though the armour it was wearing was charred from silvery into a smoky 
grey, Ayame knew exactly what it was.

But she just couldn&#39;t believe it. &quot;...R-Ras es-Shamrah! How the hell did 
it survive that explosion in Kuji!?&quot;

The bio-metallic creature in all its glory. The beast stood astride 
three dead corpses, all of them workers on the ship, none were 
civilians. It seemed to have a habit of wanting normal people to escape 
its wrath unless such an action conflicted with its mission. Baga&#39;enka 
was glowing as bright as ever, the Plasma blade coursing with waves of 
electrical energy. The thing looked over to Ayame and tossed its spiky 
mass of sandy-coloured hair, turning black in patches from the purifying 
fire it had been subjected to just a day or two earlier. 

&quot;You&#39;ve played this out for long enough,&quot; The Bio-Tech creature spoke, 
its deep voice now sounding completely human and eloquent, &quot;But the 
Research Facility cannot be kept waiting any longer. I will take the 
Test Sample into my custody now.&quot;

Ayame gripped the hilt of Nobunaga again. &quot;I&#39;ll have to be cold and dead 
before I let you get anywhere near Julia. I don&#39;t know how you keep 
surviving our encounters, monster, but it won&#39;t be happening again. This 
time I&#39;m gonna see to it that you never live to see another sunrise!&quot;

Ras shook its head. &quot;Foolish. But for me to complete my objectives, 
you&#39;re going to have to die. It is under the authority of Commander 
Zephaniah that I take your life on this day. Prepare to meet with 
eternity.&quot;

Ayame swiftly withdrew Nobunaga from its sheath. Just when things were 
finally getting better this beast had to rise up from the flames of 
hell. She should have guessed from the start that Ras would not have 
been destroyed back in Kuji. However, that didn&#39;t change the fact that 
she had to stop this thing. The only question was how. How was she going 
to kill Ras? From this thing&#39;s resilience, it would probably keep 
hunting them down even when she reached Scotland with Julia. The ship 
was too far from port right now to get off, unless they stole some sort 
of emergency dingy from the other side of the deck. But what life would 
that lead to? One where she and Julia had to spend their new start 
constantly looking over their shoulders? Waiting for an attack that may 
or may not come? No. The former Dark Katana knew that she had to put an 
end to this situation now. Otherwise Julia would never have her well 
deserved peace. 

The silvery eyes of the Neo-Japanese girl thinned out. And she released 
a powerful ringing battle cry the second that she charged forwards. Ras 
evened out Baga&#39;enka behind him when he saw this and prepared for battle 
with her. Ayame ran with Nobunaga in a two-handed grip and then leapt 
from the floorboards of the deck. She glided through the air at the same 
target, Ras, and extended her right leg outwards in a flying kick. 

&quot;Ayame Diving Raven Attack!&quot;

Ras&#39; head was knocked to one side of his shoulders and Ayame&#39;s sandaled 
foot struck him in the face. The instant she did that, the girl back 
flipped from his face with her body in full extension. Both of Ayame&#39;s 
feet smacked the chin of Ras, jerking his thin metal-flesh head 
backwards. And as her body rotated backward, the sword span with her, 
slicing along the length of Ras&#39; torso and face. Ayame flipped backwards 
and skidded over the ground in a crouched position as she landed. But 
looked up to see Ras. He was hit but not hurt. Even after sharpening the 
Nobunaga she still couldn&#39;t cut the hide of Ras es-Shamrah. But the 
creature itself didn&#39;t waste any time with a jibe about Ayame&#39;s failure 
to damage him. The plasmatic blade of Baga&#39;enka glowed once again as Ras 
hurled himself straight for Ayame. The woman quickly stood up and 
quickly held her sword out horizontally, blocking Ras&#39; overhead slash. 
But the strength behind the attack was amazing. Ayame&#39;s whole body 
jerked with the contact and her feet struggled to remain firm as Ras 
pressed all of its strength into the weapon lock. And from this, Ayame 
realized that Ras had been growing stronger. It was both stronger and 
faster than it was when they first met. And that trend had been going on 
throughout all their encounters. It seemed like... the more Ras fought, 
the more it gained an affinity for fighting. It was evolving. Growing 
stronger with each strike it threw and received. A bead of sweat 
trickled down Ayame&#39;s face as she held off the techno-organic nightmare. 
But when Ras gave one final push of strength, Ayame was knocked back 
like a rag doll. The woman rolled over the floorboards of the deck until 
she came to a violent stop against the railings on the furthest side of 
the ship. Nobunaga was knocked from her hand. And a slip of blood came 
down from the corner of her mouth.

&quot;...Ugh...&quot; Ayame groaned, &quot;...It&#39;s... too strong for me... now...&quot;

Ras slowly walked up to the downed fighter. He was aware of this. His 
mechanical-muscular brain could calculate that its fighting powers were 
at a far higher level than Ayame&#39;s was. The more they fought, the 
stronger he would get. It stood above the girl, casting its shadow over 
her. Then its powerful hand reached downwards and grabbed Ayame straight 
by the neck. He lifted her up with no effort whatsoever, and looked deep 
into those silver eyes of hers.

It spoke to her swiftly. &quot;You&#39;ve survived for long enough, child. This 
is the end of your road. As it comes to all. The Test Sample will be 
returned to the Research Facility... and I shall return to my ice with 
the knowledge that I have played my small part in Master Zephaniah&#39;s 
plans.&quot;

Though Ayame was struggling to breathe, she had to question Ras about 
that. &quot;Zephaniah?&quot;

&quot;The leader of the Shougatsu Financial Group,&quot; Ras replied, &quot;His plans 
will change the world as you know it. I was created merely as a prelude 
to his bio-engineered race. When his plan is  realized, the weaknesses 
of human beings like yourself shall be enshrouded by the shadows of 
organisms that are far more powerful than me. Do you see it now? The era 
of mankind has finally run its course. And now? It&#39;s time for you to 
die.&quot;

&quot;Shadow Crescent Moon!&quot;  

Both Ayame and Ras stopped as they were when they heard the bellowing 
scream of an attack called out by a third voice. A female voice. A 
speedy crescent-shaped blast of amethyst power was shot out from nowhere 
and struck Ras in the arm. The arm that held Ayame. For the first time 
the creature growled with sheer agony, dropping Ayame instantly. The 
Dark Katana fell to the ground, choking, but more shocked to see someone 
throwing a magical attack like that. Ras skidded back and gripped his 
arm in pain, while it still throbbed with streaks of purple lightning 
that were running up and down it. The bio-tech monster looked over at 
the direction from which the blast came. It was appeared to be shocked 
to see the person who stood there.

Julia.

But not as she normally was. Her hands were glowing with smouldering 
purple energy. And her normally green eyes glowed with that very same 
shade. Her soft chestnut brown hair was hovering upwards, while her 
dress swayed from one side to the other, despite the lack of a breeze. 

Even Ayame was shocked to see this. &quot;...Julia..?&quot;

&quot;Impossible!&quot; Ras bellowed, &quot;You were injected with a special chemical 
that prevents use of your magical powers! You cannot be doing this!&quot;

But if it broke the rational laws then Julia didn&#39;t seem to care. A huge 
gust of wind circled her as the flames of darkness surrounded her hands. 
Her affinity was with the magic of darkness. And now she finally had 
control over it again. &quot;You&#39;re making me angry...&quot;

Julia&#39;s flaming eyes began to darken. &quot;...You won&#39;t like me when I&#39;m 
angry...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

Aarin and Ingrid bolted down the steps of that long, spiralling 
staircase. It was build into the edge of the Castle. And every time 
Aarin passed a open-air window he could see the brightness of the sun 
beaming down upon the grass fields of &#145;Eden&#39;. If he botched this up then 
he would never get to see things like that again. He and his sister 
continued to run down the steps to the lower levels. While running he 
went into his pocket and withdrew a map of Neuschwanstein Castle. It had 
been given to him by Setsuya. And it had been given to Setsuya by 
someone else in the tournament, a magic user of some kind. Aarin opened 
it up while he ran down the stairs with Ingrid. It showed him where he 
needed to go. Down to the holding cells. He knew the way there with this 
map, but one remaining question was which holding cell would Lin-Lin be 
in? From the notes scripted on the map, there were about fifty or so 
holding cells and each of them could contain at least one person. It 
would take more time than they had to find her. And Aarin didn&#39;t feel 
right leaving Setsuya alone to fight Zephaniah. Setsuya could handle 
himself up if he killed Zephaniah too early then the Shougatsu would be 
all over him. Then that would be it for him. Game over. So Aarin had to 
be quick in how he handled this. 

While running down the staircase alongside her brother, Ingrid couldn&#39;t 
help but wonder, &quot;What is going on here, Aarin? Why do they want our 
swords?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t exactly know!&quot; The older of the Highland Siblings stuffed the 
map back into his pocket and kept on running, &quot;We haven&#39;t actually 
figured that out yet! But if these swine are essentially willing to kill 
and kidnap people for them then we can only imagine that its not 
something good!&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we let the Neo World Federation handle it?&quot; Ingrid asked, 
&quot;This is the exact kind of thing they have to deal with isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Aarin spoke in stride. &quot;They do not have a sufficient amount of 
evidence, apparently. We have to spear-head the fight against them 
ourselves until we get off this island. Then we will let the NWF take 
care of it. But first things first, we have to find out which cell these 
people are holding the girl in!&quot;

As they ran down the final length of that staircase they came to a new 
level below. One that had been barred from entry by tournament 
participants. Now the tournament was over and Aarin really didn&#39;t give a 
damn for the rules anymore. Especially not for these guys. The other 
staircase led down to the holding cells. The open doorway ahead of both 
sets of stairs led to a new section of the Castle. Before going to the 
cells they had to find out which one Lin-Lin was being held in. Aarin 
grit his teeth and looked over at Ingrid. 

&quot;Stay here,&quot; He ordered commandingly, &quot;I&#39;m going to find someone who can 
tell me where the girl is. If anyone comes by, take care of them, but do 
not go overboard. We have the cover of secrecy now and I do not want to 
lose it.&quot;

Ingrid just nodded. &quot;You can trust me, Aarin.&quot;

The young man nodded back and then ran through the open doorway in a 
long corridor. Filled with fire torches and suits of archaic armour. 
Firm iron doors were built into the sides of each stone brick wall, and 
the design followed the way downwards to the other end. Any door would 
do as long as someone was in it. Aarin went to the first door ahead of 
him and yanked it open via the iron handle. He strained to open it but 
the heavy door slowly came around. He walked inside and saw a young man 
standing in front of a table. He was pouring a liquid from one glass 
tube into another and mixing it with another substance. This was a room 
for research. The young scientist turned around as he saw Aarin. 

And he was shocked. &quot;You! You are one of the tournament fighters! Get 
out! You are not permitted to be here! Go back or I will call the 
security team!&quot;

Now Aarin was really getting sick and tired of playing nice with these 
bastards. The blonde swordsman gripped the Wind Soul and un-sheathed it 
quickly. He rushed over to the scientist who dropped his glass vial in 
fear. Aarin lunged at him and forced his back down onto the table. Then 
thrust Wind Soul right at the young man&#39;s neck. But rather than cut him, 
Aarin stopped and gave the scientist a devilish glare. &quot;I am thoroughly 
tired of playing around with you scum! So here it is! You tell me where 
the girl is or you&#39;ll be breathing through a bloody second hole in the 
middle of your neck!&quot;

The scientist froze. &quot;...W-What g-girl...?&quot;

&quot;The girl you and your cohorts kidnapped in Neo-China!&quot; Aarin pushed the 
Wind Soul even closer to this man&#39;s neck, &quot;What holding cell is she in?! 
Tell me now!&quot;

His fear did the talking for him. &quot;...S-She&#39;s in h-holding cell 08! 
There I told you! Please don&#39;t kill me! I have nothing to do with that 
girl&#39;s kidnapping.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Just what Aarin wanted to hear. But he couldn&#39;t let this go 
completely. Aarin&#39;s free hand curled into a fist and punched the man 
straight in the stomach. The scientist gasped with the pain of being 
winded and then toppled over, passing out. Aarin didn&#39;t want to hurt the 
guy but couldn&#39;t take the risk of him alerting the security team about 
his presence. So Aarin quickly sheathed the Wind Soul and then ran back 
out into the corridor. He re-closed the door and jogged back to Ingrid 
at the far staircase. 

Ingrid brightened as Aarin ran past her. &quot;Did you find it out?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I did!&quot; He then began running down the second set of steps which 
led to the holding cells, &quot;But the guy I knocked will wake up in about a 
half hour&#39;s time! We&#39;ve got to move!&quot;

The younger sister nodded and followed her brother. If nothing else, 
this tournament had turned out to be a lot more surprising than anything 
else that she could have imagined. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Central Courtyard, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

&quot;Hey you! Answer me! What did you mean by that!?&quot;

Zephaniah kept smiling to himself at how flustered Setsuya was becoming. 
But he was not like those Setsuya had fought in the tournament. And he 
was going to show that to this Japanese upstart. But not before 
explaining himself. The Great Knight of England heaved Shadow Edge up 
onto his shoulder so it rested behind his head. While his gauntlet arm 
hung loosely to one side of his body. 

The older man sneered. &quot;Did you really believe that you people would 
make it off this island alive? Seeing all that you have seen? This 
tournament was nothing more than a plan. A plan of mine to assemble all 
four of the Sacred Swords into one place. I have prepared and planned 
for this event for sometime now. Over the past year I have researched 
the findings of your father when he went into the bowels of the Genesis 
Comet and excavated the swords. I learned that they possess great levels 
of magic. No other items on Earth have the same concentration of magic 
boiling within them. Imagine what the Lightning Tooth could do for the 
current energy problem? Imagine what the Shadow Edge could for new Safe 
Zones that need to be built? Such weapons had to be in my control. But I 
had a far deeper use for them.&quot;

Setsuya&#39;s eyed thinned out even more. &quot;...What was it?&quot;

&quot;Purification.&quot;

Now that was something Setsuya didn&#39;t understand. Just what did 
Zephaniah mean by purification? The purification of what? Still, Setsuya 
would not let it rest. &quot;What in the hell are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;You heard me,&quot; Zephaniah barked, &quot;Those swords are great. But when all 
four are used together they can harness a magic the likes of which have 
never been seen. That was the subject of the very last study your father 
had conducted over the four swords before his... tragic assassination. I 
do not know who killed your Father. But I greatly suspected that they 
eliminated him to prevent him from revealing this secret of the swords 
to the public. And so those four swords were scattered. Until they found 
their way into the hands of us. My company worked to its fullest to find 
out all those who possessed the swords. And so I came up with Ten Sekai 
Sentou Kyousou as a way of gathering all four swords to one place. The 
Island of Creation. Here I am free of the restraints of the Safe Zones. 
And I can do as I please. My intention now is to free the great power of 
that hidden magic. Soon my scientists will discover how to unlock it. 
And when they do  I will use that ultimate magic to destroy everything 
on this worthless planet. All of the evils born during the landing of 
the Genesis Comet will be negated. And with the Four Sacred Swords I 
shall  shape a new world. And at the very helm of that beautiful new 
world will be me and my biologically enhanced race called the Deities. 
It will be a utopia. A brave new civilization. Free from the pain and 
anger of this disgusting current world we live.&quot;

Setsuya was absolutely stunned. &quot;Y-You&#39;re... insane. Do you actually 
mean to kill millions of people to start a new world? From the ruins of 
this one? And you call it a world free from anger? That&#39;s like washing 
blood away with blood! You&#39;ll prove nothing! The only thing you&#39;d show 
is how much of a maniac you are!&quot;

Zephaniah lowered his sword back down. &quot;Do not be worried, Setsuya 
Seisuji. Because you will not live to see my future utopia.  You are 
going to die right here. Along with all the others who entered the 
tournament. None of you will ever live to see another sunrise!&quot;

Well at least now he knew what this man planned to do. Setsuya doubled 
the strength of his grip around the Fire Cutter&#39;s handle. Though he 
cared about Lin-Lin a lot; Setsuya&#39;s focus had to be on killing this 
guy. If Zephaniah lived then he would probably bring about more agony 
than even the Genesis Comet was capable of. 

&quot;Even if I&#39;m killed today,&quot; Flames started burning around the length of 
the Fire Cutter&#39;s smooth metal blade, &quot;There is no way in hell that I&#39;m 
gonna let you get your hands on this sword! I won&#39;t let you get away 
with what you&#39;ve done so far and I won&#39;t let you carry out your twisted 
plans! &#145;Cause you&#39;re gonna die here and now!&quot;

Zephaniah grinned again. &quot;You know that you cannot defeat me.&quot;

Well Setsuya would see about that. The Japanese man stepped backwards 
and focused his power on the Fire Cutter. Time to conjure up some more 
of that magic. But this time his intent was to kill. Setsuya&#39;s face 
contorted with his mental determination and the flames over Fire Cutter 
grew in size. Those runic symbols appeared again. It was time to finish 
this guy. Setsuya slashed forwards with both hands gripping the sword 
and he screamed, 

&quot;Burn Shell!&quot;

A twisting cannonball-shaped surge of fire exploded from Setsuya&#39;s quick 
motion, streamlining over to Zephaniah. The Burn Shell speedily made its 
way over to him while burning itself a smoky track across the courtyard. 
But Zephaniah did not move an single inch. He simply pulled the Shadow 
Edge up into the air. The black-colour blade of the sword soon began 
glowing in the same way that the Fire Cutter had been doing. But this 
was not magic. This was a move used by Zephaniah exclusively. In the 
second that Fire Shell came close enough to hit him, Zephaniah brought 
down the sword in one powerful swing. 

&quot;Arcus Nova!&quot;

A shining emerald wave of followed the path of the sword as it slashed 
diagonally downward. That wave separated from the sword and shot 
forwards with a thunderous cry that ripped open the flagstones in its 
way. It sliced through the flames of the Burn Shell and cut it up like 
paper. The remaining cinders faded away while the Arcus Nova Attack went 
ahead. In Setsuya&#39;s direction. The young man could not have dodged of 
blocked something of that speed. The Arcus Nova wave rammed right into 
Setsuya; striking him dead on in the chest. The youth coughed up a batch 
of blood and bile as he was thrown back by the attack. He hurtled 
backwards until he slammed into the farthest wall of the Central 
Courtyard. A wave of dust blew away from that point. And Setsuya slumped 
into a tired sitting position. His face now covered with bruises and 
dirt. While a trail of blood came down from his right nostril. 

Zephaniah grinned again. &quot;That was just my power, insect. Just imagine 
what I could do to you with the power of the Shadow Edge. A horror you 
will learn soon...&quot;
