Concerned Apologies

&quot;But Daddy, I love her!&quot; Kris cried out.

&quot;Impossible!&quot; Her father countered, &quot;There is no way you can understand 
the meaning of that word.&quot; 

&quot;But Father!!&quot; Kris dropped to her knees trembling, &quot;Can&#39;t we just-&quot; 

&quot;Never!&quot; Her father snapped, &quot;You knew the consequences when you went to 
her. Julie will make things right again.&quot;

&quot;NO!!&quot; Kris pulled on her father&#39;s sleeve, &quot;Please don&#39;t harm her. She 
means everything to me.&quot; 

&quot;You should have thought about that before hand.&quot; Her father pulled his 
sleeve from the girl&#39;s grasp. 

&quot;I hate you!!&quot; Kris cried, &quot;I hate all of you!!!&quot; She ran from the 
house. 

                            ****** 

Kris sat backwards in her desk chair, watching the sun slowly move 
across the sky. Very little seemed to have changed since she was last at 
the academy. Even with moving from her Aunts place to the Western dorms 
things were pretty much the same. It might have been because she spent 
so much time at the Eastern dorms before, she remembered visiting the 
dorms first thing in the morning of every weekend, just so she could be 
with her friends. 

However things were simpler back then. She turned her head to look upon 
the photo on her desk. The exact same photo as Jenn had. She dug it out 
of her suitcase the moment she got back to her room. She let out a deep 
sigh and buried her face in her arms. 

The door opened and Jessica entered the room, &quot;Evening there, Kris!&quot; She 
cheerfully greeted the girl. 

&quot;Evening.&quot; Kris mumbled her face still obscured by her arms. 

Jessica quietly closed the door and scanned the room. Kris&#39;s suitcase 
lay open on the girl&#39;s bed, yet nothing seemed disturbed. Jessica walked 
across the room and pulled her desk chair over to Kris, &quot;Are you 
planning to mope the entire week?&quot; She asked, placing a hand on her hip. 
Kris simply shrugged, &quot;Listen, I wanted to apologize about earlier.&quot; 
Jessica said as she rubbed the back of her neck, &quot;I was having a weird 
couple of days and you know...&quot; She walked over to the other desk.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kris lifted her head enough for her eyes to be seen, &quot;I&#39;ve had 
my fair share of those days.&quot; 

&quot;I hope you are not bothered by staying with me.&quot; Jessica asked, &quot;I know 
you are used to having a room to your own and I&#39;m usually down in the 
office so I thought... I don&#39;t know...&quot; she let out a deep sigh and 
leaned against the window, glazing out at the sunset. 

&quot;You should be apologizing to Kim.&quot; Kris said distantly, &quot;She is the 
more sensitive one.&quot; 

Jessica crossed her arms, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you are not the sensitive type. 
I saw the hurt look in your eyes when Jenn choose Kimberly over you. I 
know all about you two.&quot; She nodded at the photo, &quot;So don&#39;t try to tell 
me there isn&#39;t something between the two of you.&quot; 
                                   
Kris sat up abruptly, &quot;You know nothing.&quot; She angrily said, &quot;You have no 
idea the things Jenn has suffered through.&quot; 

&quot;I was not talking about Jenn.&quot; Jessica stated point at the girl, &quot;I was 
talking about you. You can&#39;t keep burying your feelings for the girl 
like that or it is going to bury you.&quot; 

&quot;What would you know about it?&quot; Kris snapped, &quot;You haven&#39;t lost someone 
you love.&quot; 

&quot;You are not the only one who has suffered.&quot; Jessica countered, &quot;I never 
thought you to be so stupid. Have you been so blinded by that pain of 
yours that you can&#39;t accept why you are here? There is a reason your 
aunts sent you to live in the Dorms and they personally asked that I&#39;d 
watch over you for them.&quot;

&quot;They did?&quot; Kris seemed started by this thought. 

&quot;They thought this place would do you some good,&quot; Jessica stated calmly, 
&quot;However, know this, if you plan to hide away in here like you did at 
your Aunts, after Jenn tried to kill herself, I&#39;ll be right here to drag 
your butt out of the room. I&#39;m not going to let one of my girls just let 
themselves spiral into darkness. Not while I&#39;m the head of this dorm 
that is.&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot; Kris gazed out the window again, &quot;She can&#39;t love me anymore... 
it is forbidden,&quot; Kris stammered&quot; &quot;... and she... she has some... 
Someone else...&quot; she buried her head in her arms and sobbed. 

Jessica slid her chair closer to the girl, wrapped her arms around her 
and gave her a hug. Kris unravelled her arms, enfolded the girl and 
squeezed her tight, finally letting herself cry.
