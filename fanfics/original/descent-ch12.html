<a href="../original/descent-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Seeing the funeral notice hit her like a ton of
bricks. It had been such a hectic few weeks that she
had mostly put the details of what had happened to her
human body out of her mind, but the news that she was
going to be buried in a few days hit Descent hard.

She put the paper down on her battered desk, the black
haired woman gracefully rising to walk over to her
apartment window. Descent gazed out at the busy street
below, the evening sun illuminating the occasional
woman standing at street corners. It was a bad part of
town she had chosen to live in, by her own choice, but
slowly it was becoming a cleaner place.

&#39;Should I go to the funeral?&#39; Descent wondered. It
wasn&#39;t like she was going to be recognized, she had
altered her form a bit since her first public
appearance, but the idea of meeting the people she
once knew.. it was a bit unnerving.

Descent smiled slightly, &#39;And then there&#39;s the current
situation.&#39;

Over the past few days several individuals had taken
shots at either Sam or Descent, and the contacts she
had developed said that the Lady had put a contract
out on the two of them. Personally, she felt mildly
complimented by that, it was a sign they were causing
Diana some troubles. So far only amateur attempts had
been made, though from the size of the price on their
heads she strongly suspected that some heavy hitters
were on the way.

&quot;We&#39;ve handled everything so far,&quot; Descent murmured to
herself, &quot;except for that rocket attack on Jess
Drake&#39;s place.&quot;

The war with Diana was simmering, but they weren&#39;t
making as much process as she would have liked. For
every operation that Sam and Descent shut down, there
were two more waiting, not to mention the depth of the
moral depravity they were coming up against. Diana&#39;s
people seemed willing to sell anything to anyone, at
the right price.

With a sigh Descent realized that her attempts to
distract herself weren&#39;t working at all. She returned
to her desk and the paper, razor sharp mind memorizing
the details of the funeral, all the while telling
herself that she wasn&#39;t really going to go.

&quot;A funeral?&quot; Sister Samantha Teresa, more commonly
known as Sam, asked as they stood in the shadows,
readying themselves for what was to come. This illegal
money lender wasn&#39;t something they&#39;d normally worry
about, but the recent killing of several of his
clients caught their attention. It seemed that falling
behind on your payments was fatal....

&quot;Yes,&quot; Descent nodded, silently cursing herself for
even mentioning it.

&quot;Of course you have to go pay your respects,&quot; Sam said
crisply. The brown haired priest held her pistol at
the ready, her black garb suiting the severe young
woman. She continued on seriously, &quot;It&#39;s the right
thing to do, after all.&quot;

&quot;The woman being buried wasn&#39;t a very nice person,&quot;
Descent answered dryly, &quot;in fact, there were times
that I didn&#39;t even like her very much.&quot;

Sam smiled grimly as the man they were waiting for
arrived in front of the older three story building,
getting out of his fancy car and walking inside.
&quot;Maybe so,&quot; she said as Sam swiftly led them towards
the building, &quot;but at least it would give you the
chance to say good-bye.&quot;

Two men were stationed just inside the front doors,
big, hulking men who&#39;s presence practically screamed
bodyguard. As soon as they saw the two women they drew
guns and began firing, but they were even fasted.
Descent ripped the gun from his hands even as her hand
shifted into a claw, tearing at human flesh to reveal
green blood.

Sam&#39;s opponent stiffened then dropped as smoke curled
up from the silenced handgun, the odd scent of incense
and gunpowder lingering in the air. &quot;Let&#39;s move,&quot; they
ran up the stairs, neither willing to risk the old
elevator.

The hallway was quiet as Descent looked around the
corner, frowning slightly as she saw the hall was
empty. &quot;Aren&#39;t two guards a little light for
security?&quot; she asked as they cautiously moved on.

&quot;The Lady must think we don&#39;t know about him,&quot; Sam
answered, &quot;or about the organ-legging element of this
operation.&quot; They moved towards the corner office, Sam
gesturing Descent to stop a moment. &quot;On three?&quot; she
asked.

Descent counted down softly then on cue they burst
into the room together, hoping to catch their target
off guard. Instead he looked up with a warm smile,
looking almost grandfatherly with his gray hair and
round, horn rimmed glasses. &quot;If you wanted to see me,&quot;
he said to them mildly, &quot;you could have just knocked.&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Sam barked, looking around the room warily
for any sign of a trap.

&quot;Well done,&quot; he nodded, still smiling, &quot;but you two
are such well meaning amateurs, really. Do you think
the Lady isn&#39;t prepared for such as you?&quot;

&quot;What are you....&quot; Descent started to say when she
spotted the device he carried in his hand. &#39;A
detonator!&#39; she thought even as she moved.

&quot;Wait a...&quot; Sam started as Descent slammed her out
into the hall.

&quot;Down!&quot; Descent shielded her with her body even as a
soft click was heard back in the office.

K-THOOM!

The charges went off down on ground level first, then
the other explosive devices rippled the powerful
blasts right up the older building. Glass windows were
blasted out violently, raining passerby with shards,
the entire structure swaying a moment then it simply
collapsed, the utter destruction a work of art created
by demolition experts.

For a time the rubble was still as the wailing sirens
of the first ambulances ad emergency response vehicles
sounded, then a section of rubble shifted. Up it rose,
terribly slowly, then with a massive effort it was
thrust aside, revealing two badly battered but still
living women.

Descent rolled off Sam with a thump, leaving the
priest laying there stunned for a few moments. With a
groan she forced herself to sit up, body aching, only
to freeze as she felt the warm fluid soaking her black
clothing.

&quot;Not my blood,&quot; she murmured then Sam&#39;s eyes widened,
&quot;Descent!&quot;

The black haired woman&#39;s clothes were more rags than
anything else, Descent&#39;s flesh beneath torn and
shredded. Clearly she had taken the brunt of one of
the explosive devices, both the power of the blast and
the flying debris. Most shocking of all was the pole
that impaled her, blood oozing out into a puddle
around her now frighteningly still body.

With a cry Sam reached for her, only to blink in
surprise as Descent&#39;s eyes popped open. &quot;I am not,&quot;
she rasped out, &quot;doing that again any time soon.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re alive,&quot; Sam breathed out, &quot;thank God.&quot; She
looked over the bloody wounds worriedly, &quot;What can I
do to help?&quot;

&quot;Help me get the larger pieces out,&quot; Descent growled,
gesturing to the metal pole that had plunged through
her body at the shoulder.

Sam didn&#39;t offer any consoling words, instead she
grasped the pole firmly. &quot;Brace yourself,&quot; she warned
then yanked, drawing the metal from Descent&#39;s body
with a single pull.

&quot;Arrg,&quot; Descent choked off her cry, her face looking
much more demonic than normal. She swiftly and
brutally ripped the remaining glass, wood and metal
shards from her front with Sam carefully assisting at
the back.

&quot;A hospital....?&quot; Sam started.

&quot;They wouldn&#39;t know what to do with me,&quot; Descent said
grimly. Swaying she was helped to her feet, even as
the first police unit arrived on scene.

&quot;Took long enough,&quot; Sam growled.

&quot;They probably didn&#39;t get the emergency call
immediately,&quot; Descent answered bleakly, &quot;the Lady
Diana probably saw to that.&quot;

The redheaded young woman got out of the squad car,
scanning the scene quickly, then spotted Descent and
Sam. Unconcerned with her own safety she raced to
their side, her green eyes widening as she took in
their condition. &quot;What the hell happened here?&quot; she
demanded.

&quot;Well, well,&quot; Sam blinked as she recognized the
officer, &quot;Alex Conner.&quot;

&quot;Friend of yours?&quot; Descent blinked as Alex swiftly
moved to support her other side.

&quot;We worked on a case together,&quot; Sam answered.

Alex looked at Descent&#39;s bloody but gradually
shrinking wounds worriedly, &quot;Are you going to be all
right, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;With a little time,&quot; Descent groaned.

&quot;This is like that skinwalker case?&quot; Alex asked Sam.
The other woman nodded and Alex directed them to the
squad car, &quot;I&#39;d better get both of you out of here,
before anyone starts asking the difficult questions.&quot;

To be continued....

Note: Alex Conner first appeared in my other original
series Blood, Sex and Magic and has also appeared in
Daughters of Artemis. Reading those appearances aren&#39;t
necessary to understand her reactions, but it would
probably help.</pre>
