<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch34.html">Back to Part 34</a><pre>      Hoshi buried her face in the pillow, trying to smother her sobs. He&#39;d placed the curse 
on her to make sure she always obeyed him... but he didn&#39;t need to do that. As long as he 
had her sisters under his control, she would do whatever was necessary to protect them.

      &quot;Why are you crying?&quot; She kept her back turn to him. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to cry about... 
Hell, it&#39;s not like losing your virginity is going to kill you.&quot;

      She ignored him. He had promised to stay away from her sisters so long as she... Hoshi 
felt a hand travel along her naked back. &quot;You weren&#39;t bad either. But don&#39;t cry. It really 
kills the mood.&quot;

      He got up from the bed and started to put his clothes back on. &quot;Your sisters are out 
on an errand for me and they&#39;ll be back around noon. You should pull yourself together 
before then.&quot; He looked back at her and grinned. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t want them to see big sister 
crying, now would you?&quot;

      She sat up as he left the room, weeping into her hands. Hoshi wanted nothing else than 
for the damned curse to be strong enough that she would have no qualms being his whore. How 
nice it would be just to give in to a mindless existence rather than be aware of what was 
happening. Was this her punishment for thinking so lewdly of her sisters?

      Hoshi shook her head and dressed back into her clothes discarded around the room. 
Servant to the Lord of Demons. She had never been so disgusted with herself...

      She continued to sleep with him whenever he asked for it and ran &#39;errands&#39; for him. 
But they were never simple tasks. They did demon assassinations, tricked human armies and 
acted as spies. With every person she killed, Hoshi began to feel the effect of his curse. 
It was small, but it was there. After a year, Hoshi gazed at Hina and realized that she 
stopped growing. They all stopped growing. They were stuck at the ages of 26, 18 and 14.

      It was around that same time that Tsuki came to her, eye unclouded, a determined 
expression on her face instead of a painted on smile. &quot;I... I can fight it,&quot; she murmured, 
looking around the hallway. &quot;The curse or whatever he did to us. I can fight it.&quot;

      Hoshi gripped her tightly and pulled her into a room. &quot;You can?&quot;

      &quot;Yes, and I know it hasn&#39;t been affecting you that much either. I&#39;m positive that Hina 
is too young to understand so it has little hold over her as well. We&#39;ve been pretending 
since a few months ago,&quot; Tsuki said. &quot;If he still thinks we&#39;re under his spell, then we can 
all escape soon.&quot;

      Hoshi let out a happy sigh. That meant... if they could escape, they could figure out 
a way to get rid of the curse and then go on with their lives. Tsuki and her began to make 
plans when they could and even Hina was aware of it. When the sisters were altogether, they 
would exchange looks and smiles, knowing that they would soon be free.

      Unfortunately, plans never went the way they are supposed to. It was all Hoshi&#39;s 
fault. She&#39;d been able to push her innermost desires to the back of her head until the day 
when Tsuki and Hina hurriedly changed in front of her after one of their &#39;errands&#39;. Every 
one of those nasty thoughts assaulted her the moment she saw Hina&#39;s sun kissed skin and 
Tsuki&#39;s pale features.

      The curse inside of her whirled and tightened because her weakness had been exposed to 
it, something that didn&#39;t go unnoticed by her master later that night. &quot;You&#39;re unusually 
submissive,&quot; he murmured after their usual activities. &quot;Something wrong?&quot;

      She just shook her head, staring blankly at the ceiling. Hoshi felt like she was lying 
on a bed of clouds, like her whole sense of reality had been stripped away. The curse did it 
to her, but she didn&#39;t mind. It was bliss to be out of control of herself - no longer having 
to cry when he had sex with her or wrestle with the desire for her sisters. It was so... 
nice.

      He stared at her for a long time before a grin waltzed onto his face. &quot;My, my, even 
big sister has a weakness. Tell me,&quot; he said, rolling over to face. &quot;Tell me what it is.&quot;

      Hoshi could help but giggle. She didn&#39;t know why. &quot;I love my sisters so much... I&#39;m 
supposed to protect them, but all I want is to do is touch them.&quot;

      He stared at her in disbelief before his smile returned. Hoshi guessed that he was 
surprised, but pleasantly so. &quot;Really, now?&quot; He sat up. &quot;You&#39;ve been such a good big sister, 
that I think you deserve a reward.&quot;

      He had whispered evil things into her ear, things she&#39;d always thought about... things 
she&#39;d always wanted to do. And he was giving her permission to do them. &quot;One condition,&quot; he 
said. &quot;You cannot touch their secret place. Everywhere else is fine.&quot;

      Hoshi nodded, only half listening. The curse&#39;s hold tightened and she quickly dressed 
herself. That was how she found herself in Tsuki&#39;s room, looking down at the beauty that was 
her younger sister. The moon... so elusive and mysterious, but beautiful. And Hoshi would be 
the one to catch it.

      She straddled Tsuki, letting out strangled breaths. A part of her was screaming, 
screaming to stop it because this was her sister, a girl, somebody that she had to protect. 
But the rest of her... she was too far gone and she wanted it so badly.

      Hoshi let her hand cup Tsuki&#39;s cheek and relished in the soft warmth. And her lips... 
lips that she wanted to kiss so badly. She ran her thumb over them and that&#39;s when Tsuki 
awoke. The brunette jerked up in alarm until Hoshi pushed her down and shushed her.

      &quot;Wh... what? Big sister...?&quot; Tsuki whispered, trying to adjust to the darkness.

      &quot;Just be quiet, Tsuki,&quot; Hoshi murmured, her hand slipping down to Tsuki&#39;s neck, then 
her collar bone.

      &quot;Is everything alright?&quot; Tsuki asked. Hoshi shook her head and her younger sister 
spoke again. &quot;Do you need help with something?&quot;

      Hoshi needed help with a lot of things. And this was one of them. Without warning, she 
leaned down and caught those lips she so desired. She was rewarded with a softness she&#39;d 
never known and a jerk from the girl below her. She could feel Tsuki trying to yell.

      Her sister shoved her away, confused. &quot;What are you doing?!&quot;

      Hoshi said nothing and swatted Tsuki&#39;s hands away. &quot;Just be quiet...&quot; she repeated, 
her hands dipping into the parting of Tsuki&#39;s robes. When Hoshi&#39;s hands found her left 
breast and squeezed it, the younger girl finally understood.

      &quot;Wait, big sister, wait,&quot; Tsuki said, her voice growing hoarse and desperate. &quot;Please, 
wait!&quot;

      But Hoshi didn&#39;t wait. She&#39;d been waiting far too long already and this was her 
chance... her chance to get what she wanted. Hoshi silenced her sister with a kiss. Tsuki 
eventually stopped struggling that night and for the next week, she didn&#39;t say a word. Hina 
was the only one who noticed the hollow looks in her sisters&#39; eyes and the way the horrid 
smile reappeared on Tsuki&#39;s face.

      Their master noticed it as well. &quot;Hoshi,&quot; he said one day, calling her away from her 
sisters. &quot;I&#39;m very pleased with your... interactions with Tsuki. Look at how obedient she is 
now...&quot; He trailed off, looking at the two other sisters.

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; Hoshi said. &quot;Ever since I&#39;ve started visiting her, Tsuki&#39;s gone back to 
the way she should be.&quot;

      The Demon Lord smiled. &quot;You&#39;ve done such a good job,&quot; he murmured. &quot;Actually, I came 
here to say that I will no longer be requiring your presence in bed. I think you should 
focus on your sisters... both of them. I think Hina is getting a bit unruly, don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t you?&quot;

      Hoshi looked over her shoulder at the blonde girl who was trying to talk to Tsuki. The 
brunette was too affected by the curse to respond normally. &quot;I...&quot; Hoshi started, before a 
small smile crept on her face. &quot;I suppose so.&quot;

      He watched the silver haired woman leave, trying not to laugh to himself. It was 
absolutely perfect - Hoshi&#39;s perverse desire for her sisters would ensure him three loyal 
servants. So long as he allowed her to molest her sisters, she had no reason to go against 
him. And if she molested her sisters, they would be forced to give in to the curse. Perfect.

      Hoshi didn&#39;t care about that or even realize what was happening to them. That night, 
all she was worried about was keeping her hands buried in Hina&#39;s golden locks and her mouth 
tasting the delicate flesh of her neck. 

***** 

      Hoshi stopped for a second. &quot;I want... I want a place where I will be free to be with 
my sisters.&quot; Her expression became happy and dreamy. &quot;I want us to be altogether and to be 
in a world where I can love them freely. That&#39;s what our master promised me back then and 
that&#39;s what she&#39;s promising now.&quot;

      Krystal just stared at her. &quot;Is that why... is that why for hundreds of years after 
your last master died you&#39;re still his servant?&quot;

      Hoshi nodded. &quot;This world... this world looks down on our type of love. It can&#39;t 
understand how I feel... no one can. Not even you.&quot; She frowned and looked over at Krystal. 
&quot;I see the way you look at me and I know what you&#39;re thinking. You think I&#39;m disgusting for 
loving my sisters, don&#39;t you? You love women as well and just because the women I love are 
my sisters... you think I&#39;m even worse than you.&quot;

      Krystal said nothing, her mind racking for a solution. Hoshi was now almost completely 
enveloped with dark energy, so she may have a chance to hurt her.

      &quot;When the world is recreated by our master&#39;s hands, I will be free from service and I 
will have a place in the new world to be with Tsuki and Hina. That&#39;s all I want...&quot;

      Krystal swallowed, hoping Hoshi would go crazy on her again. &quot;Even if you&#39;re forcing 
them into things they don&#39;t want?&quot;

      Hoshi ground her teeth. &quot;You don&#39;t understand! I know them better than anyone and I&#39;m 
the only one that can care for them properly.&quot; Her voice became quiet and nostalgic. &quot;When 
Hina can&#39;t go to sleep, I know exactly which story to whisper to her...When Tsuki&#39;s arm 
cramps up, she turns to me to help it. If Hina gets sick, she likes a certain kind of soup 
and if Tsuki gets sick, she wants a certain kind of tea. When they sleep, Tsuki twitches and 
Hina hogs the blankets...&quot;

      Krystal watched a pained expression come over Hoshi&#39;s face. The silver haired woman 
looked like... like she didn&#39;t know what to do with herself. &quot;I just... love them so much,&quot; 
she whispered. &quot;So I have to do this. There&#39;s no turning back. I&#39;m past the point of no 
return.&quot;

      &quot;No one is ever too far gone,&quot; Krystal said.

      Hoshi straightened up. &quot;Enough of all this. I think it&#39;s time for you to stop.&quot;

      &quot;Sorry, but I can&#39;t do that!&quot; Krystal focused all of her remaining energy in her blade 
and released an immense blast of holy power.

      Hoshi looked surprised at the spontaneous attack, but merely slashed at it with her 
sword. Krystal fell to her knees in shock as her attack dissipated into nothingness. She&#39;d 
spent everything she had on that...

      &quot;You&#39;re so silly, Krystal,&quot; Hoshi said, her tone going back to playfulness. &quot;We&#39;re 
both able to use holy attacks and since I&#39;m much more powerful than you, it&#39;s not going to 
work. Would you like to see how it&#39;s done?&quot;

      With a flick of her wrist, Hoshi imitated Krystal&#39;s attack, albeit with a lot more 
power. The blonde didn&#39;t have time to defend herself as the white light washed over her. 
Hoshi let out a sigh. &quot;Looks like you will be having a nice nap...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Alright, time for you to go get my cousin,&quot; Josh grunted out, pulling open the door 
with the help of Sakura.

      &quot;Good luck,&quot; the angel said.

      Isaka nodded and looked down the corridor. It reeked of death and despair. Just what 
she needed. &quot;If I keep going down this hallway, then I should reach the innermost chambers?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, they didn&#39;t put much thought into the architecture of this thing,&quot; Josh said 
with a shrug. &quot;You&#39;ll feel a lot different in there, but you should be able to take on 
Tsuru.&quot;

      Isaka rolled her eyes as she walked through the doorway. &quot;You&#39;re just saying that, 
Josh...&quot;

      Sakura gave her a slight wave and the two of them watched the demon sprint away, 
leaving nothing behind but her shadow.

      &quot;Will she be alright?&quot; Sakura asked the young man.

      &quot;Yeah, if Krystal&#39;s able to help her, all will be good.&quot; He turned towards her. &quot;We 
need to go help the others though. They&#39;re taking a long time.&quot;
