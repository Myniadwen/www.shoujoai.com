Chronicle Six - because his name is &#39;Rain Harland&#39;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Any and all contact with the Triad of the Inquisition had always been 
considered a great issue to deal with in the Protocolian terms of life. 
Always. That sentiment had not changed, even in the face of the Great 
Schism. Which was why all of the attendants at hand were fawning and 
pawing over the one who would be speaking to them today. The Temple of 
Tlazolteotl, better known to the people as the &#39;Holy Protocolian 
Palace&#39;, was one of the grandest structures in Middle America. Possessed 
of many tall and gigantic stone columns that supported the building and 
glorified it with the power and the outright dominance of its creators.  
It was surrounded by a large and expansive set of intricately designed 
water gardens. The long stretch of stone that crossed through the water 
gardens, the pathway into the centre of the compound (the Temple of 
Tlazolteotl) was telling of the size of the area. Because the path 
inwards alone was less than half a mile long. Such was the size of this 
place. Though from outside it might have appeared to be nothing more 
than a large shrine from the forgotten Nahua eras, the innards of the 
temple were far different to the outside. The inside of the Temple of 
Tlazolteotl was composed of the modernity of the contemporary world. It 
possessed three Control Rooms at least. And was guarded by over 150 Meta 
Suits. Each of them being the Baal marionettes. Those types of Meta 
Suits that were controlled by a highly advanced automated computer 
system. They stood guard over the Temple, monitored by the data 
collectors inside the Control Rooms. It was important that they 
protected this temple, you see. 

Because it was home to a woman who would come to be one of the most 
important in the entire world. 

High in the upper echelons of the Holy Protocolian Palace was a very 
large hall. One that acted as a kind of meeting hall. Its walls were 
adorned with poetry scrolls, woven tapestries and flickering flame-glass 
lamps that ignored the electrical systems of the temple. A long golden 
rug had been run over the floor leading to the far end of the room. 
Surrounding that hearth rug were tall statues carved in the shape of 
prone young women, standing silently as if they were submitting 
themselves to some greater will. A few suited guards, men dressed all in 
black, stood without words as protection for the woman sitting on the 
very edge of carpet&#39;s path. A youthful female of no more than 23 years 
of age. That woman was of great significance, especially to the young 
attendants by her side. Though they did not know her by her true name, 
her past name, all called her what the Protocolians regarded her as. 

The woman known as Princess Ashura. 

And she was the notional leader of the Holy Empire of Protocol. 

The young adult sat with her legs folded underneath her, her rich and 
lavishly designed white and gold robes collecting in bunches around her 
bare feet. With her extremely elongated chocolate brown hair flowing 
down from her scalp, and her sultry and wide forest green eyes, Ashura&#39;s 
almost incomprehensible beauty was already unmatched in this world. The 
girls who primed and prepared her for the address from the Triad of the 
Inquisition found themselves blushing and giggling when did this for 
her. Princess Ashura herself remained unfazed by their attractions to 
her and the embarrassed behaviour thereof. Her quiet, calm, almost cold 
face proved that much. Then in time those three attendants of hers 
finished their preparations of Princess Ashura&#39;s dress and left the 
grand hall to tend to the rest of their duties. While Ashura was left to 
wait silently for the address from her masters. The ones known as Aherg, 
Ein and Karahi. The stone ceiling of the hall had an opening part of the 
way above. A computer screen slowly descended from that opening, then 
shifted itself around by the joints of its pulleys and gears so that it 
could be seen by the princess at a natural angle. That video screen then 
switched itself on. The background of the screen was dark. So much so 
that it completely enshrouded the three hooded figures in darkness. 
Those three hooded men were the Triad of the Inquisition. 

Princess Ashura lowered her head in reverence for them. &quot;It is a 
pleasure that my eyes are to grace themselves upon you all once again, 
sirs.&quot;

Aherg, the first of the Triad, nodded. &quot;Greetings, Princess Ashura. We 
are extremely pleased with the progress you have been making so far. 
Anointing you as the leader of the Holy Empire of Protocol was no 
mistake, even in the least.&quot;

&quot;I am pleased you think that, sir,&quot; Ashura replied, &quot;...but the most 
important work is yet to come, is it not?&quot;

Ein, the second of the Triad, answered that. &quot;Correct. Ever since the 
insurrection of William Ank Celaph, our strategic strength over this 
world has dwindled. Internal conflict has become rife. It is as any 
great philosopher predicted. One&#39;s greatest enemy is found within 
oneself.&quot;

Princess Ashura raised her head with a bob of understanding. She knew 
exactly what Ein was speaking of. The Great Schism. The fate that befell 
Protocol during the attack on Ix Nos Babel, no more than six months ago. 
The Reunion had been attempted, between this generation&#39;s Eros and 
Thanatos. And the result had been a failure, succeeding only in the 
production of another imperfect God, another Vulnus Deus. The Triad of 
the Inquisition changed their plans when this happened. And those plans 
were thwarted by both Celaph and the Eros. The woman called &#39;Yumi 
Mishima&#39;. Since then, the political/militaristic/theocratic/territorial 
power of Protocol had been split into two halves. One of those halves 
was New Protocol. A faction created by Celaph and his supporters, as 
well as those who frowned on the actions and intentions of the Triad. 
The New Protocol was a group that abandoned the theocracy of the old 
order. Many felt that it was too stern and heartless. The attempt by the 
Triad to destroy the cities of Meta London, Meta Cape Town and Meta 
Tokyo had shown to many members of Protocol that brutality firsthand. 
They commanded over 68% of Protocol&#39;s overall military power, which 
might have seemed like too high of a number to really seem 
challengeable. But what the New Protocol faction did not have control 
over was the Divine Blade, the most important part of the Protocolian 
military. And that was the firm edge of the second half of Protocol.

The Holy Empire of Protocol.

That faction was the one that retained the old ways. Those members of 
the global organization that retained their loyalty to the Triad of the 
Inquisition. Those who wanted to see change in the world. By passive or 
violent ways. It was the legendary phrase of &#39;By Any Means Necessary&#39; 
that echoed the loudest of all in the Holy Empire of Protocol. The HEoP 
had since distanced themselves from the incident at Kyoga Island. But 
had also done something different than usual. They had selected this 
young woman, Ashura, to be their leader. Truer to the fact was that the 
Triad had &#39;selected&#39; her. She was considered to be the perfect 
figurehead to counter the noble image of New Protocol&#39;s champion, 
William Ank Celaph. Hence her current Goddess-like status. The Great 
Schism, the divide in the ranks of the Protocol organization, had torn 
apart the world as well. The Upper Council was now powerless, just a 
bunch of old men and women bickering aimlessly. People across the world 
were rallying to the side of Protocol they felt more connected to the 
ethics of. Those who feared death joined New Protocol. Those who sought 
the newer future that the HEoP were offering joined to them. Others just 
aligned themselves with whoever it seemed was going to win the war. Many 
whispers had suggested that it would be New Protocol. And considering 
the fact that public support for them was growing, it was not outside 
the realm of possibility. 

Ashura sighed. &quot;...That man. Celaph was a such a great leader. If not 
for him then Protocol would never have been accepted to power in Asia. 
Yet he betrayed us. And look at what it has led to. Protocol is torn 
asunder. EDEN has been emancipated. Chrysalis roams free in world 
without restraint. Father Bartholomeus continues to preach the Ark of 
the Luria to those willing to listen. Ix Nos Babel is out of our hands. 
General Naam has been killed. And the Divine Blade is no longer what it 
was. How is it that a man such as Celaph can cause such problems with 
only one action?&quot;

Karahi snorted. &quot;He commanded more respect than any of us were aware of. 
But fear not, Princess Ashura. Your immense beauty and courage shall 
soon be the flame that the moths of humankind will flap to. Let not your 
flame flicker. The Second Genesis is at hand.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; She replied, &quot;it will take at least two days for the 
Divine Blade to carry out the mission, but the North American Sky Cord 
will provide the best means for reaching Meshezabel. And the Divine 
Blade&#39;s new leader, General Selena Fol, should be the perfect commander 
for the securing of it... if what I am told of her has any truth to it. 
The only problem I see now, is...&quot;

Aherg nodded. &quot;Yes. But do not worry about that issue. We have already 
found the perfect candidate for that position. He might not be the most 
glaring of choices... but rarely does one find an Ashtar who is so 
deeply tainted by sadness. The &#39;Seed&#39; is strong within him. And he will 
achieve symbiosis soon enough, with or without our intervention. The 
major problem is not Celaph or New Protocol right now. Our great concern 
must be for the rebels and the Eros.&quot;

Princess Ashura&#39;s eyes thinned. &quot;...I have heard much about her. The one 
known as Yumi Mishima. To think that a descendant of God could achieve 
symbiosis... it is living proof that the bloodline is still impure. How 
could Dr. Katsuragi have overlooked something like that?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps he did not,&quot; Ein suggested, &quot;there was a great deal that he 
concealed from us with regards to his &#39;daughter&#39;. We should have learned 
that lesson and entrusted the Eros sample to the Ochiai Underground 
Research Facility from the beginning. But the past is the past. Our way 
is to look to the future. And Eros will be a great impediment to our 
futures, Princess.&quot;

Ashura blinked. &quot;Is that why you sent the Thanatos here, sirs?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Karahi said, &quot;he has already attained the gift of symbiosis, just 
as the Eros has done. And preparations for the Raum have been completed. 
He must have a second confrontation if our will is to be done. Do you 
understand, Princess Ashura?&quot;

&quot;Of course, sirs,&quot; The brunette replied, &quot;...it is all so enthralling. 
An Ashtar has been discovered and both the Eros and Thanatos are fully 
synonymous with the Heart of the Astaroth... I can feel that this is the 
beginning of the new world.&quot;

While Ashura spoke on with the Triad of the Inquisition about the issue, 
one of the subjects of their conversation was admiring another aspect of 
it. High above the meeting hall inside was the roof of the Temple of 
Tlazolteotl. And on the wide roof of that ancient temple was the one 
known as Freeman Ronove. The Thanatos of this generation. And the father 
of the 41st Vulnus Deus. The smog-green haired teen stood cross-armed, 
his eyes looking upwards at the gigantic vision of his towering Meta 
Suit, the Raum. The Aztec-style leggings he was wearing flapped to one 
side when a gust of wind blew in from the east. But all the same he 
looked up to the Raum. With both pride and esteem. And when he felt 
those emotions, small streaks of purple lightning-like energy, a 
manifestation of his Qi, traced up and down his arms and chest. Just 
being close to the Raum filled him with strength. This was the mobile 
war machine that had been sculpted in metal and programmed with the DNA 
of his &#39;forefathers&#39;. It would be his vessel in battle. The tool by 
which he would bring down all those who dared to stand against the HEoP. 

&quot;A faint hymn,&quot; Freeman muttered absently, &quot;such is the cry of the weak. 
To be led to that which they call freedom. The desire of theirs which is 
individuality is the prison of life. Isolation, segregation, and 
separation. These are the engines of destruction that mankind was forced 
to endure as a consequence of the Second Sin. And yet we turn to the 
fruit of that evil to provide the Spirit of God the offering of a new 
genesis. The ironies of this world... shall never escape me.&quot;

The loud chime of wind blowing through the valley muffled the sound of 
footsteps. So Freeman could not tell when a young woman walked up to him 
from behind. A young woman dressed in the dark green and gold uniform of 
the Holy Empire of Protocol. She had semi-Eurasian looks about her, 
indicating that she was probably from a nation like Turkey or Syria. 
This woman ran a finger through her hair and coughed from her throat to 
draw Freeman&#39;s attention away from his own personal thoughts. Thanatos 
lowered his smile and turned around, uncrossing his arms. 

Freeman observed her for a second. &quot;...You?&quot;

&quot;The name is Private Leena Fol,&quot; Replied the woman, &quot;I have gotten word 
from North Control Room. Mister Freeman Ronove. You are to return to 
your quarters to be briefed on your role in the coming Operation M. 
There can be no further delays.&quot;

Freeman smirked idly. &quot;...Is that so? Tell me. Do you have any real 
hopes in life?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Do have any ambitions?&quot; The Thanatos asked, &quot;Any dreams?&quot;

Leena looked away. &quot;...W-why are you asking me this?&quot;

&quot;Heh. I thought so. You do have a dream, don&#39;t you? What is it?&quot;

Private Fol looked back at the curious Freeman, and she nervously rubbed 
against her cheek with her thumb. She didn&#39;t like this man much. There 
was no big or powerful reason for it, Leena just found him to be a very 
creepy guy. But though he had no rank in the Holy Empire of Protocol&#39;s 
Army, he was still technically her superior. So she answered him as a 
sign of respect. &quot;...I wish to end the war. So that my sister will no 
longer have to fight. I want to return Protocol to its dominance over 
the world and heal its wounds.&quot;
 
Freeman closed his dark eyes with a chuckle. &quot;...Those are fairly lofty 
desires for such an inconsequential girl. Even the mind of a sole worker 
bee can want to change the way a hive works. Human beings are so much 
alike that. Everyone in this world has a dream. A desire. Some might be 
the same... and most are different from each other. Our desires are a 
mark of our impurity, our individuality. This was the fate that we were 
subjected to by destiny. So I wonder... why would a worker bee like 
yourself be straddled to the waist of a group that would seek to 
dissolve that... taint?&quot; 

Leena blinked in confusion. &quot;...What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Homo sapiens,&quot; Freeman spoke, &quot;Homo sapiens are the imperfect offspring 
of the Child of God. They are those who walk the world in autonomy and 
chant the language of individual desire, the language that forsakes the 
very righteousness of God. Homo sapiens are the mistake of life. So it 
confuses me... as to how Protocol can align itself so totally with the 
race.&quot;

&quot;...Is that a habit of yours? To be so self-critical?&quot;

The current generation&#39;s Thanatos pulled another heavy grin. &quot;That 
doesn&#39;t quite apply to me, my dear.&quot;

Leena sneered at him. &quot;How so?&quot;

&quot;Because...&quot; Freeman turned around and faced the Raum suit once more, 
crossing his arms again into their previous position, &quot;...I am no longer 
human. And neither is she...&quot; 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The main conference room of the Leviathan was not the largest. But it 
was definitely the most significant. Next to the bridge, of course. The 
gigantic steel air/land/sea battleship, home to the Chrysalis rebel 
army, hovered with its powerful engines over the waters of the pacific 
ocean. The ship had just recently stopped off at EDEN. Just to make a 
few repairs to the ship and its Meta Suits. And once the Leviathan was 
refuelled it was ready to take off. Normally the crew of the ship would 
stop off at EDEN longer than just two days. But they had to keep moving 
towards their current destination. As hard as it was to believe, 
Chrysalis would be helping Protocol to defeat... Protocol. The idea of 
Chrysalis working alongside New Protocol after all they had been through 
still seemed odd to many people. In fact, more than a few soldiers 
resigned from their posts because of their mistrust towards New 
Protocol. It was certainly an opinion shared by the populous of EDEN. 
But that was understandable. For those souls had to suffer the rule of 
Protocol for at least three weeks after the first battle on the metal 
sea city. Fortunately, Father Bartholomeus was supportive of the idea. 
He too knew that if things were to change on this planet then New 
Protocol had to be sided with. Because it was becoming obvious to all 
that there was a deeper enemy to contend with; one that was far more 
significant than the deceased General Naam or William Ank Celaph. Those 
enemies were the Triad of the Inquisition. They weren&#39;t holding all the 
cards but they were certainly in a position to steal them. Thus a union 
of effort between Chrysalis and New Protocol seemed to be the best way 
of stopping them.

Four people had gathered in the conference room. The leader of the ship 
and its crew, Colonel Cecelia Faye Beatrix. Alongside her was her second 
and lover; Major Sophia Mariette.  Across the large holo-screen table 
was the half German/half American Lieutenant, Terry Hennig. The 
masterful ace pilot of Chrysalis and the owner of the Bishamon Meta 
Suit. And next to him was one of the newer members of Protocol. The 
woman smiled and frowned upon by destiny. The very Eros of this 
generation, and the unintended mother of the 41st Vulnus Deus. The pilot 
of the fabled Oriax Meta Suit. That young Japanese woman was called...

...Yumi Mishima.

Or more accurately, Lieutenant Yumi Mishima.

Sophia absently pushed her spectacles up the bridge of her nose with a 
sole finger, re-positioning them. Then she placed her fingers to a 
keypad fixed into the edge of the table that the four of them stood 
around. Once she began tapping a few codes into it, a small holographic 
display of a certain village appeared.

&quot;This is the village of Green Cloud,&quot; Sophia announced, &quot;it&#39;s located in 
the American state of Texas, about 3.4 miles north of the old city which 
was once known as El Paso. That is our target. And that of the Holy 
Empire of Protocol.&quot;

Terry shivered visibly. &quot;...Geez. Just hearing that name makes me feel 
colder. But what the hell. Seems like quite a show that those Holy 
Protocol bastards have planned.&quot;

Yumi turned to Terry with stern, almost authoritative eyes. &quot;What makes 
you say that?&quot;

&quot;Well they wouldn&#39;t be heading to some remote village outside the Meta 
Cities if there wasn&#39;t something pretty valuable down there. Remember 
what you told us about Ix Nos Babel and Kyoga Island? They would never 
have been built in the Arctic if the Ancient Ruins weren&#39;t below them. 
See what I mean?&quot; 

Beatrix pressed her hand into her hip. &quot;...You may have a point. So I 
can confirm the truth about it. Strategically, the Green Cloud village 
is important to Protocol. Ever since the Great Schism, both factions 
have been clamouring to secure any military base or territory they could 
before the other got their hands on it. This just happens to be one of 
the more important ones.&quot;

&quot;If that&#39;s the case then why didn&#39;t the Holy Empire attempt to secure it 
in the beginning?&quot; Yumi questioned. 

Sophia answered that one. &quot;Because they couldn&#39;t. The religious element 
of Protocol was never a predominantly powerful aspect of Protocolian 
life in the Americas. Thus when the Great Schism occurred, people were 
forced to rally to the faction they felt most comfortable with. It 
stands to reason that HEoP backed away from Green Cloud because of a 
lack of public support to consolidate the seizure of it. They probably 
didn&#39;t want to bother until they beefed up their armies a bit. In which 
case it really doesn&#39;t matter what the people think.&quot;

Terry crossed his arms. &quot;Typical Protocol. But what about it? What&#39;s so 
special about a tiny American village?&quot;

&quot;I got the de-briefing documents from the New Protocol forces that are 
on their way there,&quot; Replied Sophia, &quot;Apparently, there is a vast 
section of underground corridors beneath Green Cloud. Ones that link 
directly to a valley in the north which has been dubbed by the locals as 
&#39;Death Gorge&#39;. And inside that gorge is one of the four Sky Cords. The 
steel towers that act as ramps for the transportation of shuttles and 
cargo vessels into space. As we all know the other three Sky Cords have 
been reclaimed by New Protocol. But this one...&quot;

Yumi sighed. &quot;...I&#39;m starting to get the picture. Celaph is concerned 
that the Holy Empire of Protocol are going to seize Green Cloud and gain 
access to the Sky Cord. By which they can leap into space and attempt at 
taking over the Lunar Base... and its AM-Cannon.&quot;

&quot;That seems to be their plan,&quot; Beatrix added, &quot;The New Protocol forces 
fought like dogs to retain both Lunar Base and Ix Nos Babel. It seems 
that purification isn&#39;t quite off the minds of Holy Protocol just yet. 
We have to do everything in our power to stop them from taking over the 
last Sky Cord. Even if it means working alongside Celaph.&quot;

Sophia turned to Beatrix, adjusting her glasses. &quot;...You knew him, 
didn&#39;t you, Colonel?&quot;

&quot;Yes. But that was a long time ago. He has changed and so have I.&quot; The 
high commander of Chrysalis then turned to Yumi, &quot;Lieutenant Mishima. I 
can understand the fact that you might not be very comfortable with this 
mission after what happened in Ix Nos Babel six months ago. If you want 
to refuse it... feel free.&quot;

Yumi shook her head, waving her shoulder-long locks of snow white hair 
to one side. &quot;Don&#39;t be concerned with me, Colonel. I&#39;ve come to terms 
with what happened on that island long ago. You needn&#39;t distress 
yourself with it.&quot;

Terry and Sophia didn&#39;t feel too reassured about that. Yumi had been 
subjected to horror upon horror in her life. What happened at Ix Nos 
Babel might have only been one of them... but it was clearly different 
from the rest. Protocol had used her to re-create God. And from learning 
of that fate, she also learned of the true nature of the one woman she 
seemed to love. Chizu Yagata... 

Colonel Beatrix nodded to her. &quot;Very well. The Leviathan is already on 
its way to Green Cloud. We&#39;ll meet with Celaph and his second once we 
get there. I&#39;ve heard rumours that Holy Protocol has a new leader. If 
that&#39;s so, I assume it shall be one of the things we will be discussing 
with him. So. We&#39;ll reach the village in a few hours time, shortly 
before nightfall. You all should get some rest beforehand.&quot;

Yumi, Terry, and Sophia saluted their Colonel in acceptance of that, 
then excused themselves.  The look shared between the Major and the 
Colonel seemed to suggest that Sophia wouldn&#39;t be sleeping alone for the 
night. But that went unnoticed by Terry and Yumi. Most people on the 
Leviathan had no idea that Beatrix and Sophia were a couple. The 
automatic door to the conference room opened up for Yumi when she walked 
through it, and she gaited from the doorway with a quiet stride. Terry 
quickly followed and watched her walk from behind. He had noticed a lot 
of changes in the girl since the battle at Ix Nos Babel. Yumi had both 
grown... and become less attached at the same time. Before, in the days 
preceding the attack on EDEN, Yumi had been quiet and full of 
post-adolescent angst. Not enough to really make her a total recluse, 
but it was there. But after what happened, Yumi had changed a lot. And 
in the six months since that time, those changes seemed permanent. Now 
Yumi had become stern and silent, cold and firm. Her eyes were no longer 
na&#139;ve, they were confident. But that new confidence came with a dramatic 
shift in attitude. Yumi was less talkative, more work-driven, and 
completely unafraid to kill Protocolians in the name of the future. 
These changes weren&#39;t all unwelcome. Yumi was by far the greatest weapon 
and soldier that Chrysalis could have hoped for. It was hard to see a 
downer in that. But no one in Chrysalis saw Yumi for the person she 
was... aside from Terry. They were friends, and he didn&#39;t like what he 
was seeing in Yumi these days. He almost missed the shy, unstable old 
Yumi in comparison to what she had become now. 

Terry shook the concerned look off his eyes and ran up to Yumi from 
behind, catching up with her. &quot;Hey, Yumi!&quot;

Yumi looked over her shoulder. &quot;Lieutenant Hennig?&quot;

&quot;Hey...&quot; Terry shook his head, &quot;What have I told you about that? When 
we&#39;re in private just call me Terry, alright?&quot;

Yumi blinked at him. &quot;...Okay. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to apologize. But can I ask you something?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Yumi wondered. 

&quot;You agreed to this Green Cloud mission,&quot; Terry put forth, &quot;but you know 
that we&#39;ll have to meet up with Celaph and that Chizuru girl again, 
right? Are you sure you wanna go through that again?&quot;

Yumi turned her gaze from Terry. &quot;That was a long time ago, Terry. I&#39;m 
not afraid anymore. I know what they did to me... I remember it all as 
clearly as if it occurred yesterday. But I won&#39;t run from it. I have to 
stop the Holy Empire of Protocol as well as whoever it is that&#39;s 
controlling them from behind the scenes. The same people who ordered the 
use of the AM-Cannon. I have my mission. And I want to make sure that no 
other child has to experience what I went through for those ambitions. 
That&#39;s why I fight. And it&#39;s the same for you, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;What about your happiness? That&#39;s important too.&quot; Terry said.

Yumi sighed once more. &quot;Terry.&quot; 

&quot;Huh? What is it?&quot;

The young woman turned around and pulled a diminutive smile at her 
half-Germanic, half-American friend. &quot;Thank you. For caring about me.&quot;

Terry returned the same smile. &quot;...Yumi...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

America was, agriculturally speaking, the most fertile nation in the 
world. During the war of almost 150 years ago, the USA had been the 
first country to use atomic and chemical weapons. This in turn was then 
used against them with equal passion from the other half of that war, 
the Middle East. The southern states were the worst hit of all. Much of 
the sandy/rocky/desert-like terrain was bombarded by those WMD missiles 
and infected by its taint. After the war ended, researchers (who would 
some day become members of the Protocolian AI team) went to work on 
chemicals that could de-contaminate the southern areas. In 2089, they 
come up with a solution. A kind of compound substance that had the 
ability to neutralize toxic waste and pollution. A short few years 
afterwards, gallons of that chemical substance was sprayed over the land 
by planes and Meta Suits. Soon afterwards the land became re-liveable. 
And an after-effect was the sudden high rate of fertility in the soil. 
Some leading scientists suggested that this was caused by the mixing of 
the toxic substances with their anti-toxic solution. Some argued that it 
was caused by the regeneration of barren lands, newly fertilized by the 
anti-toxic agent. No matter what the reason was, it was now clear that 
the southern region of America would yield much more in the way of crops 
now that the landscape had been re-forested so effortlessly. 

It explained why Texas was now covered in a blanket of forests and 
farmland. One of those forests was near the small village of Green Cloud 
which had been built only forty years ago by vagrant escapees from Meta 
San Antonio. Inside that forest was a small cove. Gloomy moonlight 
poured in from the jewelled black heavens. But the sight inside that 
cove was far from frightening or intimidating. Because a young man sat 
inside it. A boy with a destiny that far transcended this place. He was 
medium of stature, at 5&#39; 6&quot; feet in height. The wind swiped his thin 
bangs of silvery hair from side to side over his forehead. The wind went 
on to caress his soft and pale white skin, pink lips and gently tease 
his glittery blue eyes. 

The boy, this male youth appointed by destiny for tasks that were as 
yet, unknown, was called Rain Harland. The quiet youth sat before the 
chopped stump of an oak tree. The surface of it was smooth. Smooth 
enough for Rain to place a sheet of paper and eight multi-coloured ink 
jars on it. With a paint brush between his long fingers, Rain dabbed the 
green ink of one of the jars and brought the bristles of the brush to 
the paper. We went on to write a Kanji symbol. One that was &#39;Ten&#39;, 
pertaining to &#39;Heaven&#39;. Calligraphy was the only subject that Rain had 
enjoyed back in his school days. Mostly because it gave him the perfect 
excuse to draw Kanji symbols, an after-effect of love for the nation of 
Japan. Coming to the cove of the forest to do this was one of his 
&#39;guilty pleasures&#39;. Often he would skip his villager chores to do this. 
But it wasn&#39;t like he had parents to scold him for doing that. 

Perhaps it was the lack of parental guidance that brought along that 
cold, heartbreaking look of sadness in Rain&#39;s eyes. Even the small smile 
he practiced during his calligraphy, couldn&#39;t hide it. While Rain 
continued to work on his Kanji, the leaves of a northerly bush parted 
for a young woman. The girl pulled the twigs and grass blades from her 
chestnut hair and strode up to the stump that Rain was working at. 

&quot;Rain!&quot; The girl yelled, &quot;I&#39;ve been looking for you everywhere! Why on 
earth did you leave the town meeting so quickly? I didn&#39;t even have a 
chance to catch up with you!&quot;

Rain put down his paintbrush and looked up. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Edwina. I tried 
tell you I was leaving. But it got... complicated. I didn&#39;t want to sit 
there and hear the elders talk about their fears of Holy Protocol. I am 
tired of listening to them bicker incessantly about fighting... I hate 
it...&quot;

The brown-haired girl, Edwina Saffron, lowered her scowl of anger. Rain 
often came to his not-so-secret cove when he wanted to get away from 
something. A topic of constant presence was protection of Green Cloud 
from outsiders. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry, Rain. I shouldn&#39;t be so mad at you. I 
know how much you hate fighting.&quot;

&quot;...I just want to live out the rest of my life,&quot; Rain said, &quot;...I don&#39;t 
want to do things like that. And yet all the elders seem to do is think 
about what&#39;s right for themselves. Why is this?&quot;

Edwina kneeled down to the tree stump, next to Rain. &quot;...They aren&#39;t 
just thinking of themselves, you know. They care about all of us. 
Especially you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s because... they think of me... as a weapon.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the best pilot, Rain,&quot; Edwina said, &quot;I know you don&#39;t like to do 
it. And I haven&#39;t forgotten about what happened to your dad. But nobody 
in the village is as good as you are in piloting Meta Suits. We look to 
you for protection. But... if things were different... I would have 
wanted to be the one to protect you, Rain.&quot;

The young man blinked. &quot;...Edwina...?&quot;

&quot;...Hmm,&quot; Edwina blushed a little, &quot;...well... we are arranged to be 
married after all. Shouldn&#39;t I be able to defend my future husband as 
well as any other future wife could?&quot;

Rain pulled a tiny smile. It wasn&#39;t fake or misleading. It was a true 
smile. Something that Rain didn&#39;t often do while he was outside the 
presence of Edwina. She was the only reason he fought inside Meta Suits. 
He cared not for Green Cloud or the elders. All he wanted to do in life, 
even if it meant fighting, was to protect Edwina. And it was that same 
will that had brought along such heartbreak and tragedy in the boy.

Edwina nudged her head towards the exit of the cove. &quot;C&#39;mon. I&#39;ll whip 
up something nice for you, today. My mom and my father should be back by 
now. You should spend the night at my place.&quot;

Rain nodded to Edwina and started tightening the caps of all his ink 
jars. He slotted them into the brown backpack he had brought with him to 
the cove, along with his two paintbrushes and the sheets of paper he had 
taken out. Both used and not used. Soon afterwards he zipped the 
rucksack back up and slung it over his shoulders. He and Edwina then 
left the cove and walked out into the moonlit darkness of the forest. 
The two walked together slowly as the owls hooted into the distance. 
Edwina took the time to admire that sound as she walked. Along with the 
snapping of the twigs, the gentle babbling of a nearby brook, and the 
soft rustling of the calm winds that blew through the branches and 
leaves of the surrounding oak trees. 

The two stayed silent during their short walk back to the village, until 
Edwina suddenly blurted out. &quot;...Rain? Do you think I&#39;m a tomboy?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Some of the girls in the village called me that. They didn&#39;t know I 
could hear them. They said, &#39;that tomboy Edwina sure doesn&#39;t mind being 
such a loudmouth&#39; and &#39;that Ed-girl better hope to find a real man 
before it&#39;s too late&#39;. Is that... true?&quot;

Rain looked surprised. It was no secret that the majority of girls in 
Green Cloud thought of Edwina as a tomboy. Despite her feminine looks, 
she had more of a fierce temperament than the adult males of the 
village. But she always took it in her stride and held her chin up. This 
was the first time Edwina had seemed... concerned by what was said about 
her behind her back. That startled Rain a little bit.

&quot;...Ignore them,&quot; He said, &quot;...I don&#39;t mind the fact that you&#39;re a more 
confident person than they are. I don&#39;t see that... as a bad thing. The 
thing is... I&#39;ve always... liked that about you, Edwina. You&#39;re always 
so strong...&quot;

Edwina found herself blushing again. &quot;...You think so?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh.&quot;

&quot;...Rain...&quot; She murmured, &quot;...you&#39;re such a sweetie.&quot;

That was how it was between Rain and Edwina. They constantly reinforced 
each other and supported one and other. It was the way that they handled 
things between them. It was one of the many reasons that they liked each 
other so much. Enough for them to do anything to protect each other. 
While Rain and Edwina walked down the thin dirt road that cut through 
the forest, Edwina noticed something far in the distance. A twinkling 
set of lights. About five of them. Floating in a position that was 
probably just above the homes of the village.

Edwina pointed them out in the night sky. &quot;Hey. Look at those.&quot;

&quot;...What?&quot; Rain&#39;s baby blue eyes focused on them, &quot;...oh no. Those 
lights are from Meta Suit exhaust...&quot;

&quot;Huh? Meta Suits? Is Green Cloud under...?&quot;

Rain rapidly turned to Edwina. &quot;Quick! Get to one of the shelters as 
soon as you can, Edwina! I&#39;m going to have to... fight them off, okay?&quot;

Edwina nodded, knowing this was his duty. &quot;...Be careful.&quot;

The silver-haired youth bobbed his head to accept that and then darted 
off for down the dirt path. He ran as fast as his legs could, to get to 
a certain point in the path when it split off into three trails. One of 
them (the left pathway) lead to the western regions of the forest, where 
the abandoned Protocolian Research Facility was. The middle pathway led 
into the village of Green Cloud. But Rain took neither of those and 
dashed through the one to his right. It was a shorter trail than it 
looked. And it brought Rain to a large (or at least tall) building. A 
storage warehouse. The Harland boy jogged to the door and pulled out a 
key card from his trouser pockets. He slotted the key card through the 
indentation of the control panel and the automated door then opened for 
him. The light flickered on when Rain entered the warehouse, which 
revealed the four things that were of any worth here. Four Meta Suits. 
Each of them of a stocky frame and brown armour. Rain ran up to one on 
the centre right. A steel ladder was there next to it. He climbed up 
that ladder and made it to the upper balcony that stood before the 
entrances to the cockpit of the Meta Suits. The stomach cockpit of his 
own Meta Suit opened for him as he came to it, and Rain jumped inside, 
seating himself on the leather pilot&#39;s chair. The stomach doors into the 
suit closed and then the whole suit came online. The video screen 
flashed on, brandishing the name of this Meta Suit. &#39;Syoga&#39;. It was an 
old model. Used mainly these days for construction purposes in the Meta 
Cities. But by using a battle-ready operating system by making a few 
adjustments to the controls, the technicians in Green Cloud were able to 
make this a combat-standard suit. 

The automatic doors on the ceiling of the warehouse slowly parted 
themselves for the Syoga when Rain typed the exit codes into the keypad 
of his suit. The thrusters of the Syoga then kick-started and the old 
Meta Suit flew up into the sky, through those doors. The mecha bolted 
into the cold night air -- moving vertically and then horizontally. The 
Syoga darted towards Green Cloud with the most of the quickness of its 
thrusters. Soon the Syoga found itself flying over the houses of the 
village. A short ways ahead, five Meta Suits were hovering over the 
centre of town. Each of them being from the Holy Empire of Protocol. The 
standard symbol on the chests of those Meta Suits, a golden sword 
positioned before a reef of holly, showed who the pilots pledged their 
fealty to. Most of those Meta Suits were Amon-types. The main Meta Suit 
of the legendary Divine Blade. But the one in the middle was a 
custom-model Meta Suit. It was leaner version of an Amon, one that 
carried a potent-looking Beam Rifle in its metallic hands. That had to 
be piloted by the leader of this set-up. 

The Syoga rushed into the sights of the four Amons and the custom model 
Meta Suit. Once they were in full view of it, the Syoga came to a stop 
and hovered motionlessly in the air. Rain then yelled out to them 
through the speakers of the suit. &quot;You there! What are you doing here?&quot;

-- ASSIMILATION --

The crude pilot of Amon #1 chuckled. &quot;Heh, heh, heh. You gotta be 
kidding me! Look at that outdated Meta Suit! Is THIS the best that these 
stupid peasants have?&quot;

The pilot of Amon #2 added in the laughter. &quot;Ha, ha, ha, ha! This&#39;ll be 
cake! Hey, General Fol! Should we take care of this little hunk of junk 
or what?&quot;

All eyes and scanners turned to the custom model Meta Suit. As Rain had 
suspected, the one leading this band of attackers was inside it. The 
pilot was the new leader of the Divine Blade. With the deaths of both 
General Naam and Captain Kraepelin at Ix Nos Babel, the next person to 
succeed as leader was Selena. The strident sister of Leena Fol smirked 
inside the cockpit of her suit, gripping the control sticks. Her sights 
were locked firmly on the Syoga.

&quot;Idiots!&quot; Selena barked, &quot;That suit might be older than dirt but just 
look at his Qi-Level! He has a synchronization level of over 4,000 
units. This is no ordinary kid.&quot;

The pilot of Amon #3 gulped. &quot;...Um... doesn&#39;t that make him... stronger 
than us...?&quot;

&quot;Heh, fear not,&quot; Said the confident pilot of Amon #4, &quot;This guy is 
unarmed and there&#39;s five of us! We&#39;ll destroy this interloper in the 
holy name of Princess Ashura!&quot;

-- PROCESS -- 

Then the Amons rushed ahead. Well, one of them did. Amon #4 zoomed 
across the small space between its group and the Syoga. It pulled up its 
beam rifle and fired a chain of shots at the suit. The Syoga instantly 
acted, darting to one side of those blasts effortlessly. It flew around 
in a half-circle motion and then closed in on Amon #4 from the side. 
Before the Protocolian pilot could even command his suit to act, the 
Syoga bolted in front of it. Then extended its leg and spun around with 
a heavy roundhouse kick. With one super-sharp motion, the head of Amon 
#4 was knocked right of its shoulders. Oil and sparks of electricity 
stained the decapitated neck of the Amon. And it exploded soon 
afterward. The Syoga flew backwards to avoid the force of that 
explosion. And thankfully it occurred high enough over Green Cloud to 
prevent it from effecting the village. 

-- REACTION --

Selena and all the burly pilots of the Amons gasped. An unarmed 
construction-style Meta Suit of the oldest kind had just kicked the head 
off an armoured Amon mecha. The pilot of Syoga, Rain, just sighed. He 
hated fighting. He hated it with a passion. An effect that had deeper 
implications than just... sadness. Rain scowled when he felt a burning 
pain in his chest. His hand gripped it tightly. And he suddenly felt 
hot. His whole body in fact. His muscles trembled along with this heat. 
And a smoggy aura rose up from him. It looked light wisps of cold air 
rising from dry ice. But that gassy air was as hot as fire. Sweat 
trickled down from his forehead which rapidly rose in temperature. Rain 
closed one of his eyes and tried to get a grip on himself. This 
sensation happened every time he killed someone on the battlefield. 
Another of the reasons he disliked fighting and killing on these Meta 
Suits. But the fragile boy held himself the best he could, struggling to 
control his breathing.

&quot;...What...&quot; He laboured to say, &quot;...do you want...?&quot;

Selena chuckled. &quot;Heh, heh, heh. It seems that Green Cloud will be a 
little more interesting than I thought. Fine! I&#39;ll take you on myself! 
No matter what your Qi-Level is, it&#39;ll be an easy fight with my Morax! 
Get ready... to die!&quot;

The Morax Meta Suit, as Selena called it; ignited its thrusters and 
prepared to attack. The Syoga got into a position to defend itself, when 
an glowing energy blade came swiping through the torso of one of the 
Amons. Amon #2&#39;s pilot screamed violently as his mecha was chopped into 
two even pieces, and then exploded into bitter flames. A steel sword 
Meta Suit-sized sword then hacked through one of the remaining Amons as 
well. The third Amon blew up from that actions, spitting its blood-like 
oil into the air. Selena, Rain and the nameless pilot of Amon #1, turned 
to see the two foreign suits that had established themselves as 
attackers. And Selena knew just what those suits were and who they 
belonged to. 

Those mecha were the Oriax and the Bishamon M-2.

Terry chuckled from the cockpit of the Bishamon. &quot;Heh! You know, five 
against one just doesn&#39;t seem like fair odds to me. I guess we&#39;re gonna 
need to even this out a little. But that doesn&#39;t spell good news for 
you, does it, shitwitz?&quot;

The subdued Yumi called out to Selena from her Oriax&#39;s watery 
dimensional-cockpit. &quot;Just who are you?&quot;

Selena smiled, despite her situation. &quot;...My name is Selena Fol. The 
greatest ever Meta Suit pilot in the history of the Fol Family. And I am 
the leader of the Divine Blade. But I know you two well. The man inside 
that red suit is the slayer of General Naam and the Bahamut Meta Suit. 
And the one in the Oriax is Yumi Mishima. The thief of the great 
destroyer... I&#39;m honoured.&quot;

Terry abandoned his smile. &quot;...So you&#39;ve taken over from Naam? Well that 
didn&#39;t take too long. Six months seems quick for the replacement of the 
Divine Blade&#39;s leader, eh Yumi?&quot;

&quot;Be careful, Terry,&quot; Yumi answered, &quot;she&#39;s got a Qi-Level of 5,450. We 
shouldn&#39;t underestimate her.&quot;

Amon #3 set up a private communications link with the Morax. And his 
image appeared on the screen of Selena&#39;s control panel. &quot;General Fol! We 
are outnumbered! I think we should retreat now!&quot;

Selena growled. &quot;...I don&#39;t like showing my back to my enemies... but in 
this case... you&#39;re right...&quot;

The Morax and Amon #3 then suddenly bolted into the air with the 
thrusters of their armour. Rain, Terry and Yumi all watched them escape, 
only to hear Selena yell back, &quot;This isn&#39;t over! Anyone who denies the 
will of Princess Ashura will be destroyed!&quot;

Yumi blinked. &quot;...Princess Ashura...?&quot;

&quot;Forget them,&quot; Terry said to her from his cockpit, &quot;we can take care of 
that girl at any time.&quot;

Rain, who by now was close to passing out, pressed some keys on the 
keypad of his Syoga&#39;s controls. This set up communications with the two 
Meta Suits that had helped him, the Oriax and the Bishamon M-2. Rain&#39;s 
face appeared on the screens of both mecha. And he spoke soon 
afterwards. &quot;...W-who on earth... are you two...?&quot;

Terry answered that one. &quot;...The name&#39;s Terry Hennig. My friend over 
there is Yumi Mishima. And we&#39;re working for a group called Chrysalis. 
We&#39;ve come to help Green Cloud against Holy Protocol.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Far-off from the nightly village of Green Cloud, existing in locations 
that as yet remained unknown, three men were observing all that had 
taken place in that small American village. Those three men were the 
Triad of the Inquisition. Aherg, Ein and Karahi were in their gigantic 
hall of darkness. They stood around a circular video screen which had 
been shaped in the form of a pool of water on the hard marble floor. On 
it was an image of the three Meta Suits left standing in the skies above 
Green Cloud. The Syoga, the Bishamon, and most importantly of all, the 
Oriax.   

Karahi spoke first. &quot;...Eros has appeared. Her body seems to have full 
control over her symbiosis. If that is the case... the preservation of 
her via the Periodic Phase Sealing Phenomenon might not occur. Now that 
our plans have changed, her power is too important for that not to take 
place.&quot;

&quot;Fear not,&quot; Ein answered, &quot;the Second Reunion will see to that. The 
Divine Hibernation will be assumed once again. Even if it means 
sacrificing another of our pawns. Besides. Our utmost concern must be 
for the securing of Meshezabel as well as the activation of the Elymus 
Drive.&quot;

Aherg nodded. &quot;...That is so. And the plan moves swiftly. Not only is 
the boy&#39;s tremendous Qi melding itself seamlessly with the Heart of the 
Astaroth... he is also assuming synchronization with the first of our 
three Gods of Wrath...&quot;

Behind Aherg, Ein and Karahi, stood that tall and dominating figure. 
That large winged, purple-armoured Meta Suit that glowed very 
ostentatiously with a smouldering aura of Qi. And though it could not be 
seen, Aherg was smiling. 

&quot;...The Diablos...&quot;
