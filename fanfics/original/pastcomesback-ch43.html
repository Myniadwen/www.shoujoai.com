<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch42.html">Back to Part 42</a><pre>      &quot;Um, can I ask another favor?&quot;

      Krystal and Isaka had been planning their own special time that night after the bath. 
Hina, however, was still a bit lonely. &quot;Can... I stay with you guys tonight? I don&#39;t want... 
to be by myself.&quot;

      The little girl before them looked so pathetic and needy that the two lovers had a 
feeling their special night would have to wait for later.

      &quot;Oh, you can stay with us.&quot;

      The three of them all looked over to see that it was Erin who had spoken, Faye right 
by her side. Hina brightened up. &quot;Really?&quot;

      Faye nodded. &quot;Yeah, you should probably leave Krystal and Isaka alone since they have 
a lot of catching up to do.&quot; She winked at the couple, making Krystal blush and making Isaka 
wish Faye couldn&#39;t read their love thoughts.

      Erin held out her hand to Hina. &quot;You have such nice hair so let&#39;s go comb it before it 
tangles up.&quot; As they started to leave, Krystal tugged on the collar of Faye&#39;s shirt.

      &quot;Hold on - you better just be sleeping with her and not &#39;sleeping&#39; with her,&quot; the 
blonde said, giving the goddess and wary look.

      Faye held up her hands in defense. &quot;Hey, we aren&#39;t that weird. I mean, me and Erin 
already satisfied ourselves today and Hina&#39;s stuck in puberty.&quot; Suddenly, a sly grin broke 
out of the red head&#39;s face. &quot;Plus, Tsuki and Hoshi would be mad if they didn&#39;t get to take 
their little sister&#39;s virginity.&quot;

      Isaka let out an exasperated sigh. &quot;They probably would... I just wish all three of 
them would get over themselves and confess their love for each other. It&#39;s so... obvious!&quot;

      Krystal shook her head. &quot;That&#39;s not exactly true. What about Tsuki? She obviously 
seems a lot more hesitant-&quot;

      Isaka rolled her eyes. &quot;Tsuki gets a pretty nice reading on my gaydar.&quot;

      &quot;And I already took a little peek into her mind. She&#39;s as straight as a twisty straw,&quot; 
Faye confirmed. &quot;She&#39;s just... a little more stubborn than her sisters.&quot;

      Krystal rubbed her temples. &quot;Just promise me you guys won&#39;t do anything...?&quot;

      Isaka frowned. &quot;Wait, why are you lumping me together with her?&quot;

      Krystal let out a slight laugh. &quot;Because you have the nasty tendency of forcibly 
outing girls. Need I remind you of Mina?&quot;

      The demon was defeated, knowing that her girlfriend was right. &quot;And you,&quot; Krystal 
said, pointing at Faye. &quot;You have a bad habit of giving poor girls &#39;hands-on&#39; experience in 
order to get them to hop the fence.&quot;

      Faye scoffed at her. &quot;Yeah, well some girls do need a bit of a push and what better 
way than to show them what they&#39;re missing out on?&quot;

      Krystal grabbed Isaka&#39;s hand and started to head to their room. &quot;Alright Faye, but 
just don&#39;t do anything inappropriate to Hina!&quot;

      Faye laughed at the thought and headed back to her own room where Erin was currently 
braiding Hina&#39;s hair. 

***** 

      Tsuru had woken up on such a delightful morning, with the smell of breakfast wafting 
into her room. She&#39;d promptly changed, not forgetting her eye patch of course, and headed 
out into the hallway. It was then that she was struck with... well...

      &quot;Thanks so much for last night,&quot; Hina said with a smile to both Erin and Faye. &quot;It was 
really nice of you guys to let me sleep with you.&quot;

      Tsuru froze in the hallway, trying to process the information she was hearing.

      Erin just laughed. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s fine Hina. We were happy to help you out.&quot;

      &quot;If you ever feel lonely again, just come talk to us. We&#39;ll be sure to-&quot; Just as Faye 
was finishing up, Tsuru came over and defensively cradled Hina to her chest.

      &quot;What the hell are you two doing?!&quot; She shouted at the goddesses. They were stunned, 
as was Hina. &quot;How could you do such a thing to this poor child? She&#39;s barely recovering from 
the curse and you jump on her like a pack of wolves?!&quot;

      With that, Tsuru quickly whisked the girl away faster than Child Protection Services, 
leaving the two women confused. Faye let out a long sigh. &quot;Jeez, have one threeway with a 
girl and everyone thinks you&#39;re a sex crazed maniac.&quot;

      Erin giggled. &quot;But you are a sex crazed maniac.&quot;

      Faye raised an eyebrow at her lover. &quot;Really? I didn&#39;t hear you complaining 
yesterday...&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re my maniac,&quot; Erin murmured as Faye slowly started pushing her 
back into the room.

      &quot;How about we skip breakfast?&quot; Faye breathed into her ear.

      Erin laughed again and was sure to close the door behind them. 

***** 

      Tsuki looked like hell, but Eveon decided she shouldn&#39;t ask why the other girl looked 
so tired. It probably had something to do with her sisters, so the blonde continued making 
breakfast. She wasn&#39;t sure how many people were going to be eating with them, so she was 
estimating. If worse came to worse, Eveon could make more or just heat up any leftovers.

      &quot;Here you go,&quot; Eveon said, setting down a cup of tea and some mixed fruit for Tsuki. 
&quot;Your toast will be done in a few more seconds.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you very much,&quot; she mumbled out, holding her forehead. Eveon watched as the 
girl poked absently at her food.

      &quot;Ah! Whatever you&#39;re cooking smells good,&quot; Seth proclaimed, coming into the dining. 
His happy mood diminished a bit when he saw the obviously pained Tsuki.

      &quot;You got that right,&quot; Josh said, waking right in after him and clapping his friend on 
the shoulder. &quot;The only bad thing about dating guys is that sometimes we all suck at 
cooking.&quot;

      Bakra came in with a sour look on his face. &quot;Hey... I make some mean sandwiches when I 
feel like it.&quot;

      Eveon rolled her eyes. &quot;Alright you guys - could you at least help? I think my mommy 
isn&#39;t going to be down for a bit and this is a lot for me.&quot;

      They all exchanged glances before Bakra cleared his throat. &quot;Well, I think I speak for 
all of us when I say that we aren&#39;t meant for home cooked meals.&quot;

      The girl just gave them a slight glare. &quot;But you&#39;re totally willing to eat?&quot;

      They all sat down, embarrassed. &quot;W-well,&quot; Josh choked out. &quot;We&#39;ll offer you our moral 
support back here. We have confidence in your culinary expertise.&quot;

      Eveon went back to cooking with a sigh and Seth shrugged. &quot;Man, I&#39;d be grumpy to if I 
were up cooking at 7 in the morning. I&#39;m surprised you guys are up this early.&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, we went to bed kind of early and Josh wanted to eat whatever he was smelling 
from the kitchen,&quot; Bakra said.

      Seth rubbed the back of his head. &quot;I&#39;d believe it. Tycara usually doesn&#39;t get up until 
9 or 10, but I&#39;m used to getting up earlier anyway.&quot;

      Josh suddenly said, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

      His question was directed at Tsuki, who only briefly looked up before returning her 
gaze to her barely eaten fruit. &quot;I... I&#39;m just...&quot; she trailed off before getting up. &quot;I 
think I need some fresh air. Please excuse me.&quot;

      As she left, Bakra rose from his chair, but Josh put a hand on his shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t. I 
think she needs a moment alone.&quot;

      Seth frowned. &quot;She seems completely... just out of it.&quot;

      Eveon came out of the kitchen with the toast, looking around. &quot;Did Tsuki go to the 
bathroom?&quot;

      Josh shook his head. &quot;She wasn&#39;t feeling well, so she went outside.&quot;

      The young girl set the toast down next to the other plate. &quot;She&#39;s been really down, 
but I guess it&#39;s understandable. She finds homosexuality disgusting so I think she&#39;s having 
a hard time coping what&#39;s been happening with her.&quot;

      Bakra made another move to get up and was stopped by Josh again. &quot;If she&#39;s having 
trouble with her sisters, it&#39;s pretty obvious that anything we say won&#39;t help,&quot; the exorcist 
said. &quot;We should let Hina and especially, Hoshi handle this.&quot;

      The demon plopped down with a groan. &quot;But I can&#39;t stand to see her like that...&quot;

      Eventually, Eveon returned to the kitchen, bringing out eggs, hash brown, pancakes and 
other breakfast essentials. The guys began to eat, letting their worries about Tsuki leave 
their heads for the time being.

      It was then that Tsuru came into the dining room, still holding on to Hina as though 
the girl would magically fly away without a moment&#39;s notice. &quot;They didn&#39;t do any weird 
stuff; we just slept in the same bed since I didn&#39;t want to be alone.&quot;

      &quot;Are you sure?&quot; The Demon Lord asked. &quot;I mean... they... er, Hina! The next time 
you&#39;re lonely, just come to me, okay?&quot;

      Hina nodded slowly. &quot;But Erin and Faye were really nice and cuddly.&quot;

      Tsuru let out a sigh. &quot;I know... trust me, I know.&quot;

      Hina&#39;s attention soon drifted to all the food out on the table. She wasted no time 
grabbing a seat and piling stuff on a plate. The guys just watched. Josh ruffled his hair. 
&quot;Wow, total night and day between Tsuki...&quot;

      Bakra nodded. &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s kind of... weird, I guess.&quot;

      Seth watched with a bit confusion. &quot;Is it just me or does Hina seem... to act younger 
than her age?&quot;

      When the young girl looked up to ask someone to pass the syrup, she became aware that 
all of the guys were staring at her. She shrunk back in her seat. &quot;Is something... wrong?&quot;

      They cleared their throats, looked away, pretended to be doing something as soon as 
Hina caught them.

      Tsuru watched it all in amusement before noticing that Isaka and Krystal were nowhere 
to be found. She left the dining room after greeting the guys and went back upstairs. As she 
passed by Erin and Faye&#39;s room again, she tried to ignore all the suggestive sounds coming 
from there.

      At least there was nothing coming from Abby and Sakura&#39;s room... but... Tsuru stopped 
in front of Isaka and Krystal&#39;s room before knocking lightly. No response. She knocked 
harder and was rewarded with the sound of a groan, moving sheets and footsteps.

      It took a few more minutes for the door to open, showing Isaka trying to get her pants 
on as she leaned against the doorway. &quot;Tsuru...? It&#39;s kind of early,&quot; the demon said with a 
yawn. &quot;Plus, you&#39;re interrupting my cuddle time.&quot;

      &quot;I just really wanted to talk to you about... about...&quot; It was then that Tsuru&#39;s eyes 
drifted past Isaka&#39;s shoulder to the sight of Krystal lying in bed. The blonde&#39;s hair was 
spread all over the pillow and her lips were slightly parted as she breathed. The covers 
were pulled up to about her chest, leaving her naked shoulders bare to Tsuru&#39;s prying eyes. 
Actually, the Demon Lord craned her head because the sheets were just about low enough 
around her breasts that she might be able to-

      Her thoughts were abruptly cut off as Isaka moved right in front of her, blocking the 
perfect view. &quot;Tsuru?&quot;

      The ebony haired woman nodded slowly.

      &quot;You&#39;re staring.&quot;

      She backed away, embarrassed as Isaka came out and shut the door, now completely 
dressed. &quot;Carmilla might be upset about that,&quot; the demon teased.

      Tsuru shrugged. &quot;I doubt it. Ever since she found out that my blood is disgusting, 
she&#39;s been sulking around the house and looking at me all teary eyed.&quot;

      Isaka laughed. &quot;And Krystal says I&#39;m oblivious. Maybe she&#39;s looking at you because she 
expects you to do something?&quot;

      &quot;Is that what it is? I thought she just needed some time alone...&quot; It wasn&#39;t that much 
of a tragedy for Tsuru - it allowed her to breath for the rest of the night without Carmilla 
all up in her bubble.

      Isaka gave Tsuru a little shove as they continued down the hallway. &quot;No, she wants you 
to dote on her... or something. Speaking of which,&quot; the demon suddenly stopped to face 
Tsuru. &quot;I wanted to apologize to you for everything.&quot;

      Tsuru just looked confused so Isaka continued. &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve done so many horrible 
things to you because I was only thinking about myself and what I thought was best instead 
of what was best for you.&quot;

      The Demon Lord suddenly grabbed her by the shoulders. &quot;Did you get possessed? Are you 
sick? Wait - you&#39;re a different demon in disguise, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

      Isaka was, however, unamused. &quot;I&#39;m not crazy - I&#39;m trying to apologize here!&quot;

      Tsuru let her go with a slight laugh. &quot;Sure... right. No offense but you&#39;re probably 
going to end up accidentally screwing me over next month anyway.&quot;

      &quot;No! No I&#39;m not!&quot; Isaka shouted, very much like a child. She stopped to regain her 
composure. &quot;If I... do end up hurting you again, I do it with the best intentions.&quot;

      &quot;You know, the most ironic thing about this is I actually came to you this morning to 
apologize,&quot; Tsuru said, secretly loving to watch Isaka squirm.

      &quot;Eh... why?&quot;

      &quot;Because I kicked the crap out of you two times, convinced you that your girlfriend 
was mine and take liberties on her while I was at it.&quot;

      Isaka&#39;s eye started to twitch. &quot;...took liberties?&quot;

      Tsuru felt a cloud of dread looming over her. &quot;Uh... yeah. She didn&#39;t mention anything 
about what happened?&quot;

      &quot;What did you do to Krystal?&quot; Isaka growled out.

      &quot;I-I... I just kissed her and... and drank her blood once. It was... it wasn&#39;t 
anything serious!&quot; Tsuru said, backing away.

      &quot;Who&#39;s the whore now?! How dare you touch her? It&#39;s one thing to kidnap her and say 
nasty things about me and crush on her, but to actually act on it?&quot; Isaka grabbed Tsuru and 
started to shake her violently. &quot;You know I&#39;m a possessive demon and you should know that 
you don&#39;t go kissing a possessive demon&#39;s lover, whether you&#39;re trying to trick an evil 
entity or not!&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry-&quot; As Tsuru went on yelling out her apologies, a door nearby 
opened and Sakura came out, lazily rubbing her eyes. The angel had on a haphazard robe and 
stared at the two feuding women.

      &quot;...can you be quiet...?&quot; Sakura asked. &quot;...Abby&#39;s still sleeping... and I think 
you&#39;re going to wake... Tycara next door.&quot;

      Isaka and Tsuru froze. The demon abruptly let her friend go, Tsuru crashing none to 
gracefully to the floor. &quot;...thank you,&quot; Sakura said, before slipping back into the room.

      With a sigh, Isaka reached out to Tsuru. &quot;Well, I feel a lot better letting all that 
frustration out. Truce?&quot;

      Tsuru had no choice but to take her hand and agree to it.
