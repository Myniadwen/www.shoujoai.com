<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>For the next hour Samantha found herself surrounded by a group of 
doctors and nurses as they asked her a multitude of questions and tested 
her for any possible brain damage or signs of her relapsing in to a 
state of unconsciousness. During the entire time she never saw even a 
glimpse of her parents or her little sister anywhere. She was certain 
they must be worried about her, sure they may have disliked her, but 
that would not explain why they would not be there. 

&quot;W... where is my family?&quot; She finally inquired, glancing at the many 
faces around her. She could see the question made them uneasy as they 
glanced to one another for an answer to give. Finally nurse Janis spoke. 

&quot;Do you remember what hit you?&quot; The nurse inquired lightly, her face 
long with worry. 

Samantha blinked at the woman, &quot;Yeah, my mother threw a vase at my 
father, but hit me instead.&quot;

The nurse cleared her throat, &quot;Well you see...&quot; She looked up at the 
doctor as if in search of what to say when someone knocked at the door. 

&quot;Can I talk to the girl yet?&quot; A woman dressed in a grey business suit 
asked from around the white curtain that hung around Samantha&#39;s bed. 

The doctor placed his stethoscope around his neck and straightened, &quot;I 
guess so, but try to not upset her too much, alright?&quot; He informed then 
turned to the girl &quot;This woman is from social services and needs you to 
tell her what happened. Are you alright with talking to her alone?&quot; The 
doctor asked Samantha, &quot;Or would you like one of the nurses to stay with 
you?&quot; 

Sam tensed up at the idea of Social Services wanting to talk to her. She 
had hear stories of children being taken away from their parents for 
saying the wrong thing and the thought that she could end up in an 
orphanage scared her more then living with her mother. She glanced up at 
nurse Janis and reached out for the woman&#39;s hand, &quot;Can you stay with 
me?&quot; She asked weakly. She was not sure she wanted to be alone when 
woman gave whatever news she had. 

&quot;Is that alright with you, Janis?&quot; The doctor inquired. 

Janis slipped her hand through the bars at the side of Sam&#39;s bed and 
took her hand, &quot;I would be delighted to stay at your side.&quot; She said to 
Samantha with a smile upon her face. 

The doctor nodded then turned to the Social worker, &quot;Try not to be too 
long. She is weak and lost a bit of blood. I don&#39;t want her under too 
much stress alright?&quot; 

The woman nodded as opened up a briefcase and pulled out a folder, &quot;I&#39;ll 
make this quick.&quot; 

The doctor nodded again then left the room with the other nurses behind 
him. 

Samantha&#39;s watched the women carefully as she paced before her bed, 
sifted through papers in a brown leather folder she held in her hands. 
She appeared to be in her mid to late twenties with short brown hair, 
neatly cut and curled outward around her neck, feathering out at the 
ends. Her suit was pressed without a single wrinkle in sight and she 
wore a tie tightly around her neck and tucked into her suit jacket. Her 
legs were clad in a matching pair of slacks that has been ironed so 
there was a crease along the front of each leg. One would have thought 
her as an extremely professional businesswoman if it weren&#39;t for the way 
she fumbled with the papers in her folder and searched for a pen in the 
briefcase that threatened to spill its contents upon the floor. Her 
modest clumsiness only eased Samantha&#39;s nerves ever so slightly, it was 
the way she smiled at the girl when she finally recovered her pen that 
made Sam&#39;s heart slow in pace and relax ever so slightly. Sam could 
sensed no hate or anger towards her in those soft blue eyes, in fact she 
was almost certain that she saw them faintly twinkle as their eyes met 
and this caused the girl to flush lightly and glance down at her hands, 
which still held her Meephit. 

&quot;Hello Samantha.&quot; The women finally greeted the girl as she sat upon a 
chair next to the bed, &quot;My name is Linda Polaski and I just need to ask 
you a few questions.&quot; She held her hand out towards the girl only to 
have it starred at in return.

Sam&#39;s mind froze at the sight of the woman&#39;s long fingers extended out 
towards her. She feared touching the woman and she knew it was 
irrational, but she could not help it. All she could do is stare at the 
hand, examining the perfectly short trimmed nail as if it were some 
alien object. She tried to will her hand to take the woman&#39;s but it 
would not respond, it was as if the command was being blocked by 
something. She quickly turned away from the hand and squeezed her eyes 
shut against the frustrated tears that threatened to emerge. 

((Samantha, are you alright?)) Star softly spoke up inside of her head.

((Have you been listening the whole time?)) Samantha inquired nervously. 

((Sorry.)) Star apologized guiltily, ((I can&#39;t help it. We are stuck 
together remember.))

Sam let out a sigh, ((Yeah... This is just too weird.))

((Do you want me to go away?)) Star inquired disappointedly. 

Sam shook her head, ((No... no, I want you to stay... I just...))

((What is wrong? Is there something I can do?)) Star offered. 

Sam could feel the concern in the girl&#39;s voice and it made her heart 
warm knowing someone cared about her. It was strange in the few hours 
since she had awaken Star had not said much of anything and yet Sam 
could feel her presence all around her. She had a hard time 
distinguishing if it was her own heart that was racing or Stars, she 
figured it must be her own because Star had little to fear at that 
moment. She was used to having people&#39;s minds in hers and this made Sam 
feel insecure. She did not know what to say to the girl and at the same 
time did not want her to leave her side. 

((I... I can&#39;t move my arm...)) Sam finally explained, feeling both 
pathetic and ashamed that she could not complete a simple task as this.

((You were moving it for the doctor a moment ago.)) Star noted firmly, 
((It should be fine.))

&quot;Samantha?&quot; The nurse waved a hand before the girl&#39;s eyes and Sam 
abruptly looked up at the women, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; 

Sam glanced around to find the two women were watching her intently and 
she felt a rush of heat rise up around the back of her neck, &quot;I... I...&quot; 
She stammered as she tried to find some kind of answer for the women.

((Tell them about your arm.)) Star stated calmly, ((They will 
understand.))

Samantha looked down at her hand, &quot;I... I&#39;m having troubles moving my 
arm.&quot; She stated timidly. 

Janis lead over the bed and took Samantha&#39;s hand in her, then bent the 
fingers, &quot;Do you feel that?&quot; 

Samantha could feel the smoothness of Janis&#39;s fingers on her skin as she 
proceeded to move one finger after another, &quot;Slightly.&quot; She mumbled 
embarrassed by the tingle that ran through her body at the woman&#39;s 
touch. She was never this sensitive to touch before and abruptly her 
hand recoiled out of the nurse&#39;s hand. 

&quot;Oh!&quot; Janis blinked in surprise, &quot;Did I hurt you?

&quot;N... no...&quot; Sam cradled her arm close to her chest, &quot;It... it just 
jumped...&quot; 

Janis patted the girl on the shoulder, &quot;You may find some troubles every 
now and then, but try not to worry about it too much. The doctor says 
your injuries were not as bad as they could have been.&quot; 

((See? I told you not to worry.)) Star exclaimed happily. 

Sam smiled nervously, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She said to the nurse, ((Thanks too 
Star.)) she added internally. 

&quot;How badly was she injured?&quot; Linda asked the nurse.

Samantha found herself startled by the woman&#39;s presence. She had nearly 
forgot the woman was sitting beside her and spun around to face her once 
again, a shocked look upon her face. The woman returned Samantha&#39;s 
stares with a curious gaze. 

&quot;Do you not remember me?&quot; She inquired worriedly. 

Samantha slowly nodded, she did remember the woman, however for a brief 
moment was not aware that the woman was there and this unsettled her 
immensely, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry. I...&quot; 

((Don&#39;t worry about that woman.)) Star repeated, trying to sooth the 
girl&#39;s worries, ((She probably just wants to know what happen is all.))

((But what should I say?)) Samantha anxiously inquired, ((What if they 
want to take me away from my mother and my friends?))

((Hmmm...)) Star pondered the possibility of that outcome, ((Try not to 
worry so much. I&#39;ll be here with you so don&#39;t worry.))

((Thanks)) Samantha gave a half smile that made the woman stare at her 
with even more puzzlement. 

&quot;Are you alright Samantha?&quot; She inquired, making the girl jump every so 
slightly. 

&quot;I...&quot; Her eyes darted around in search for an answer to the woman&#39;s 
question. 

((Just tell her your head hurts.)) Star suggested. 

Sam lightly touched her bandaged head and closed her eyes, &quot;My head 
hurts.&quot; She echoed.

The woman frowned and glanced at the nurse, &quot;How badly was she hurt?&quot; 
She inquired again.

 &quot;She has a severe concussions.&quot; The nurse remarked watching Samantha 
carefully, &quot;and the doctor retrieved a few fragments of glass from her 
forehead before stitching the wound shut, but other then that she is 
fine.&quot; 

Lisa turned back to Samantha, &quot;Sam... can I call you Sam?&quot; 

Sam nodded slowly. 

&quot;Can you tell me what happened tonight?&quot; Linda gently asked. 

&quot;I... is my mother in trouble?&quot; Sam inquired uneasily.

Linda nervously ran a hand through her hair, &quot;Not at the moment.&quot; She 
stated a mix of worry and unsureness covered her face, &quot;Now she claims 
that she hit you by accident.&quot; 

&quot;Where is she?&quot; Samantha demanded, &quot;Why isn&#39;t she here?&quot; Suddenly 
agitated by the absents of her parents, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t my parents be here if 
you are questioning me?&quot; 

Linda let out a sigh; &quot;She can&#39;t see you right now.&quot; She regretfully 
admitted.

&quot;Why can&#39;t I see her?&quot; Sam set her angry eyes on the woman, &quot;Has she 
been arrested?&quot; She may have had disagreements with her mother but she 
did not want her to get into trouble because of her. 

&quot;She is being questioned by an officer right now.&quot; Lisa explained, &quot;We 
are trying to piece together how you ended up laying on the front lawn 
with a concussion.&quot; She flipped through her notes, &quot;Your mother claimed 
that she accidentally hit you with a vase, do you remember that?&quot; 

Samantha slowly nodded, ((I&#39;m scared Star.)) She miserably said inside 
her head, hoping the girl was still listening. 

She could feel Star take a deep breath, ((So am I.)) Star admitted, ((I 
don&#39;t know what to do to help you.))

&quot;This is all my fault...&quot; Sam muttered, tears forming in the corners of 
her eyes, &quot;If I only stopped acting like a child then none of this would 
have happened.&quot; 

Nurse Janis lowered herself into a chair next to Samantha&#39;s bed, &quot;None 
of this is your fault.&quot; She cooed, patting the girl&#39;s hand, &quot;What would 
make you think something like that?&quot; 

&quot;If... if I&#39;d just gone home like I was supposed to.&quot; Sam chocked back a 
sob, &quot;If I just stopped running from everything. Then none of this would 
have happened. I&#39;m sixteen and... I... can&#39;t stop myself... from... c... 
crying.&quot; A dam broke inside of Samantha&#39;s heart and tears began to 
steadily flow.

Janis collapsed the bar long the side of the bed and sat down next to 
the girl, wrapping her arms around Sam and holding her lightly, &quot;It&#39;s 
alright. You are safe now.&quot; She rubbed the girl&#39;s back as she spoke. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorrrryyyy....&quot; Sam wailed into the nurse&#39;s shoulder as an 
uncontrollable wave of sadness washed over her. All her life she wished 
to be free of her mother and now it might actually happen and it 
frightened her to no end. Earlier she screwed up her friendship with 
Tristan and now she was going to loss her family. What a lousy birthday 
this was turning out to be. 

Janis sat upon the corner of the bed and held the girl as her body 
racked with sobs. She glanced up at Linda and nodded towards the door. 

As if Linda understood she retreated from the room, &quot;I&#39;ll come back 
later then.&quot; She stated as she left the room, at a loss for words. 

Janis lightly stroked Samantha&#39;s back and the girl&#39;s tears began to 
slowly subside. She looked down at Samantha, who now lay with her head 
upon the nurse&#39;s lap, &quot;Are you feeling any better?&quot; She asked softly. 

Sam shook her head, &quot;M... My head hurts.&quot; She stated through the last of 
the sobs. 

&quot;Do you want me to ask the doctor for something for it?&quot; The nurse 
offered. 

Again Sam shook her head, &quot;What&#39;m I going to do?&quot; She inquired 
sorrowfully, &quot;Where am I going to stay?&quot; 

Janis petted the girl&#39;s head, &quot;Try not to worry about that right now. 
Just rest up for now.&quot; She suggested.
