<h1>In My Heart and In My Mind (part 1 of 28)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<pre>An alarm clock came to life in the early morning hours of the day, 
screaming its call for its owner to stop dreaming and enter reality once 
again. A long slender hand emerged from a cocoon of blankets and gave 
the alarm a quick smack to shut the infernal machine up. With a moan the 
arm returned to its cave and pulled the blankets closed in an attempt to 
block out the intruding day. Within moments the alarm sprung to life yet 
again to be quickly silenced, this time by the heel of a foot. Struck 
from its place on the night table the alarm hung mere inches from the 
floor, saved from a dreadful fall by its cord. The arm snaked out from 
its hiding place to retrieve the alarm and pull it atop of the bed. A 
single green eye stared out from the blankets at the clock&#39;s display 
with its numbers reading, &quot;7:16&quot; in bright red lights. 

With a tired moan the blankets unravelled to reveal a teenaged girl clad 
in baggy pink flannel pyjamas. She sprawled out on the bed, knocking the 
blankets partly to the ground, and stared up at the ceiling. The clock 
held lightly in the palm of her hand as she contemplated if smashing it 
on the ceiling would silence the day forever when there was a knock at 
the door. 

&quot;Samantha, are you awake?&quot; The voice of her mother called out from 
behind the door. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Samantha called out irately from her spot on the bed, not making 
any move to actually get up. 

The door slowly opened and a middle-aged woman with long sleek straight 
blonde hair and a haggard look upon her thin narrow face entered the 
room, &quot;Look at you!&quot; Samantha&#39;s mother stated disappointedly, &quot;You are 
not even dressed and you have school in less then an hour.&quot; 

Samantha groaned as she rolled out of bed, &quot;I&#39;m going.&quot; She said 
listlessly as she got to her feet and stretched. 

&quot;I want to see you downstairs in ten minutes.&quot; Her mother ordered, &quot;Why 
can&#39;t you be more like your sister?&quot; She probed coldly, &quot;She is already 
dressed and eating breakfast. You are turning sixteen tomorrow so why 
don&#39;t you try acting more like an adult.&quot; Her mother left without 
waiting for an answer and closed the door behind her. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sixteen yet.&quot; Samantha muttered under her breath. She never 
understood why her mother bothered to compare her with her ten-year-old 
sister. The girl was in elementary school still while Samantha had just 
begun her first year of high school. She wished she could be back in 
elementary school like her sis. She missed recess and the long lunch 
breaks with her friends. She had found that since going to junior high 
school things have changed, a lot. Most of her friends drifted away over 
the years leaving her with only a few close friends. Now that they were 
in high school she suspected that even those few remaining would drift 
further away as they found new lives for themselves. 

They were almost adults now after all, a fact that she was reminded of 
every day by her mother since she turned thirteen. She was beginning to 
hate the prospect of becoming an adult and detested it ever so much more 
every time she heard her mother remind her of her age. She glanced 
around her room and frowned. Her mother had demanded her to put her toys 
away before her sixteenth birthday, however Samantha refused to do so. 
Stuffed animals from her childhood adorned every piece of white 
furniture that filled her room. They peeked out from behind the table 
lamp that sat upon her night table, they lined up along the dresser as 
if in some strange parade. Several shelves that her father had nailed to 
the wall above her bed were overflowing with the critter; a couple would 
fall upon her while she slept to join the others that already took up 
half the bed. She did not want to pack up all her memories and knew that 
when she got home from school there would be an argument over them just 
like everything else, but could not give a dame about it. There would be 
arguments no matter what she did or didn&#39;t do so she figured she 
couldn&#39;t win no matter how hard she tried and decided to forgo the toys 
for now and head for the washroom. 

In the brightly light washroom, with it mirrored walls and lines of 
lights above the sink; Sam got a good look at herself and let out a deep 
sigh. Her short thin wavy blonde hair hung loosely around slightly 
chubby, freckle-speckled face giving her the appearance of an twelve 
year old and not someone about to turn sixteen. She was small and frail, 
a twig in comparison to other girls, which only made her cheeks stand 
out all the more. Her eyes were the only remarkable feature she had, or 
at least that was what she had heard all her life and they were the only 
physical trait about herself that she did not detest. They were large in 
comparison to her face and held gleaming emerald irises that&#39;s colours 
seemed to shift in the light. She loved staring into her own eyes just 
to watch the way the light reflected off of them. Often wondering what 
she will look like in the years to come. She wished that the rest of her 
body would be as elegant as her eyes were, but realized that was a silly 
thing to wish for.

She grabbed a comb and run it under water before brushing her bangs out 
of her eyes. They were getting long and she figured that she would need 
a haircut soon. She parted her hair over her left eyes then quickly 
grabbed a few of metal hair clips that lay around the sink to hold her 
bangs to one side, Green, blue and one with a yellow butterfly upon the 
end. She hated the way her hair would curl around her ears and tickle 
the backs of her ear lobes so added two more hair clips behind her ears 
to hold them in place as well. Finally satisfied she hastily brushed her 
teeth and returned to her room to find some clothes. She pulled a pair 
of torn jeans and a blue t-shirt out of the dresser and tossed them onto 
her bed, then added a red hooded sweater from her closet before 
stripping off her pyjamas. It took her much longer than ten minutes to 
get prepared and she tried hard to ignore the cross look upon her 
mother&#39;s face as she entered the kitchen and took a bowl down from the 
cupboard.

&quot;Could you move any slower?&quot; Her mother scolded, &quot;You will be late for 
school.&quot; 

Samantha glanced up at the clock to see it was now fifteen minutes to 
eight, &quot;I can bike there in ten minutes, no problem.&quot; Quickly she placed 
the bowl back in the cupboard, then grabbed a granola bar and headed for 
the front door to find her sneakers, a pair of white runners that had 
turned a light brown from all the mud they had gathers from her 
adventures through the many trails behind their house. She could feel 
her mother looming over her as she stepped into her shoes and began to 
tie the slightly mud encrusted laces. 

&quot;I am beginning to wonder if we should allow you to turn sixteen.&quot; Her 
mother suddenly stated surly with a shake of her head at the state of 
the girl&#39;s shoes.

Samantha&#39;s mind froze at those words. Her mother had threatened to hold 
off her birthday before, back before her thirteenth birthday. She had 
fallen off her bike and scrapped both her knee and elbow so badly that 
blood flowed over her the new white dress her mother had bought her the 
other day. She tried hard to hold back the tears but the moment her eyes 
set upon the blood as it pool up on her knee the tears began to flow. 
Unfortunately for Samantha her mother had been talking to one of the 
neighbours out front of their house and witnessed the accident, seeing 
her daughter crying in front of the neighbours infuriated her more then 
anything in the world. She grabbed Sam by the arm and hauled her back 
into the house; only when they were out of earshot did the yelling 
start. First it was about how Sam was always destroying the beautiful 
clothes that she bought and then it was about how she was always crying 
over nothing. Sam could have had a broken arm or leg and it would still 
be nothing in her mother&#39;s eyes. Her mother&#39;s voice kept rising as she 
poured alcohol over the girl&#39;s wounds, only causing the tears to flow 
steadier. Finally her mother became so fed up with Sam&#39;s tears that she 
told the girl that if she did not stop she would not turn thirteen. 
Samantha knew deep in her mind that there was no way that someone could 
stop someone&#39;s birthday from happening, however she feared that if her 
mother set her mind to it she could stop anything from occurring.

Samantha struggled to control the anger that was boiling up inside of 
her as she stood up to face her mother. The woman was standing in the 
middle of the hall in her stark white nurse&#39;s uniform and a stern look 
upon her face. Samantha knew better then to argue with her mother but 
this was her birthday and she could not just give in on this, &quot;But 
mother you can&#39;t!!&quot; She exclaimed as panic filled her mind. Her mother 
had a way of ruining her day and she always did it at a point when 
Samantha needed to be somewhere, &quot;You promised my friends could come 
over tomorrow and everything.&quot;

&quot;Well you should have thought about that and tried harder to act like a 
lady.&quot; Her mother scolded, &quot;I swear, I honestly thought that by the time 
you got to High School you would begin to show some level of 
responsibility and here I see you room is still filled with toys.&quot; She 
chided her daughter, &quot;I have yet to see you even attempt to try acting a 
little more like a young lady and less like a child. Look at you, you 
are a disgrace.&quot; She gestured to Samantha&#39;s attire, &quot;Why can&#39;t you get a 
hair cut without my suggesting it?&quot; 

Samantha rolled her eyes. She had heard this lecture many times. Over 
the summer holidays Samantha was bombarded by her mothers accusation and 
insults. From how much of a disgrace it was to be seen with Sam in torn 
jeans or the way she always wore T-shirts that were so big on her that 
the collar would fall off her shoulder exposing too much skin, as well 
as her lack of manners or attention to her own looks. It was not her 
fault that shirts never fit and she was not going to wear some of the 
dresses her mother tried to buy on more then one occasion. Samantha had 
grown out of the frilly dress stage when she was only nine years old and 
by the time she was thirteen she stopped wearing dresses entirely. She 
wore the occasional skirt, but that was only on hot days and she would 
prefer to wear shorts even then. 

&quot;Mother, I don&#39;t have time for this.&quot; Samantha remarked coldly. If she 
didn&#39;t hurry she really would be late for class and she did not want 
that. School was one of the few things in this world that Samantha 
actually enjoyed. It was her escape from the nightmares that was her 
home and at that very moment she longed to be freed from this dispute 
and be on her way. 

&quot;That is exactly my point.&quot; Her mother stated, &quot;You never listen to me. 
You are always thinking of yourself. Why can&#39;t you try to act like me 
for once.&quot; 

&quot;Because I want to actually graduate from High School, mother.&quot; Samantha 
snapped, quickly regretting her words as her mother&#39;s hand struck her 
across the face with enough force to nearly knock the girl off her feet. 
Samantha was used to that kind of response from her mother so had time 
to brace herself for the blow, but if she had not caught the wall with 
her hand she would have been knocked to the floor.

&quot;I dropped out because of you.&quot; Her mother angrily reminded her, 
something Samantha had been reminded of from the moment she entered 
school. Her mother was forced to leave school at seventeen because she 
was pregnant with Sam; &quot;If you weren&#39;t around then I could have 
graduated and not ended up in these dead end jobs all the time. Do you 
have any idea what it is like having to be a porter at a hospital, do 
you?&quot;

Samantha rubbed her cheek as she righted herself and nodded, &quot;Yes.&quot; She 
said quietly, she knew all too well what her mother went through at work 
because every time her mother got a new job she made a point of taking 
Sam to work with her so her daughter would get a better idea of what she 
suffered through for her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She knew that bringing up her 
mother&#39;s schooling was a bad idea, but for some reason when her mother 
got on her case she always felt a need to dig right back and every time 
she received a smack for stepping out of line. Not wanting to continue 
with this fight Samantha grabbed her backpack, turned on her heels and 
headed for the door, &quot;I... I have to go.&quot; She stated then rushed out of 
the house before her mother could protest. 

Around the side of the small, two floor, duplex that they called a home 
she found her mountain bike leaning against the fence. She rarely locked 
the bike up at home even though she was well aware of how much the bike 
cost. Her mother gave it to her for graduating from Junior High and it 
was a constant reminder that she needed to graduate from High School or 
she would forever be under the woman&#39;s wing. Not wanting to deal with 
her mother any longer she grabbed the bike by the handles and ran down 
the street with it, one foot on a pedal while the other kicked at the 
ground. 

After drifting a block or so away from home she came to a stop and 
pulled off her backpack. Inside a small pouch on the side she took out a 
small yellow plastic walkman, press the large black play button, then 
placed the headphones over her head before dropping the walkman back 
into its pouch and slinging the pack onto her back. The familiar sound 
of Roxette poured out of the headphones as she leapt onto the pedals and 
tore down the sidewalk on her way to school. She tapped a hand on the 
hand break to the beat, enjoying the rhythm as Joy Ride blared through 
her ears. The tape was a mix of 80&#39;s tunes that her best friend, 
Tristan, had mixed for her over the summer holidays and she loved 
speeding along on her bike to the sound of soft rock filling her mind, 
her troubles at home nearly forgotten as the next song began to play. 

She quickly found herself lost in the sensation of the music upon her 
ears and the feeling of the mountain bike&#39;s thick tires tearing up the 
ground beneath her. She had to admit that it was a nice bike, she had 
only driven a dirt bike before summer and the height of a mountain bike 
was not easy to get used to, but after adjusting the breaks a little and 
fiddling with the gears she found the ride was smooth and graceful. She 
did not even feel the bumps as she moved off the sidewalk to take a 
shortcut through a small forest behind the school. She stood up on the 
pedals and leaned over the handle bars as she turned another corner and 
started on a downhill drop that would have scared her a few years ago 
but now she knew the path by heart and could feel her heart pounding 
hard as the wheels of the bike skid along an embankment at top speed and 
everything became a blur. Trees took on the quality of a watercolour 
painting that had been left out in the rain as she sped along the dirt 
path. She kept her eyes on the ground, concentrating hard on the terrain 
in front of her. Lightly hopping over the root of a tree and ducking in 
time to miss a fallen branch of a tree. The thrill of the near miss 
accelerated her and she felt a rush of excitement as she rounded yet 
another bend. 

((STOP!!!)) A voice suddenly cried out inside of Samantha&#39;s head. 

Before she knew what she was doing her hand quickly squeezed the brakes 
as tight as she could and she began to skid along the path. The front 
wheel bit into the dirt bringing the bike to a quick halt, however the 
back wheel refused to stop and began to leave the ground. The world 
moved in slow motion as Samantha realized that her bike was about to 
flip end over end. For a brief moment the entire world came to a 
standstill as the bike stood on its front wheel and Samantha found 
herself staring straight down at the dirt path before her. That was when 
she noticed it, sitting mere centimetres away from her front tire was a 
large toad, it appeared to be staring up at her. She abruptly realized 
that if she did not do something double-quick she would land on the poor 
creature. Without a second thought Samantha wrenched hard on the 
handlebars causing the rear of the bike to turn in mid air. The world 
abruptly returned to normal speed as the bike came crashing down on its 
side, throwing its owner off. 

Samantha toppled to the ground and lay on the path blinking at the 
canopy of trees overhead. Her heart pounded against her rib cage with 
such force that Samantha thought it would break out if it did not slow. 
Her eyes darted around as she tried to piece together the events that 
landed her on her back in the middle of the woods. &#39;What the hell was 
that?&#39; She thought to herself as she tried to catch her breath. Slowly 
she rolled her head to the side to see the toad sitting right before 
her, staring at her with those big black eyes. 

&quot;D... did you call out to me?&quot; She inquired, not really sure if she 
wanted an answer or not. Hearing voices in the forest was not something 
new to Samantha, but this was the first time she heard something shout 
at her. Over her life she always had this feeling before she stepped on 
any critter, be it furry or otherwise. She never understood what would 
stop her from hurting a creature, not like she wanted to, but this was a 
little too freaky for her. She let out a laugh then got to her feet and 
glanced down at the toad, which was still staring up at her, &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong, hmmm?&quot; She knelt beside the toad and looked into its eyes, &quot;You 
know you don&#39;t belong on the path like this. You&#39;ll get hurt if you stay 
here.&quot; She proceeded to gently pick up the toad and held it up to her 
face, &quot;You really didn&#39;t call out to me did you?&quot; 

The toad licked its eye in response.   

Glancing around she spotted a small pond off the side of the path and 
set the toad next to the water&#39;s edge, &quot;Now you stay off the path 
alright.&quot; The toad leapt from the girl&#39;s hands into the water and swam 
away, &quot;Take care little guy.&quot; She called out after the toad then turned 
to check on her bike. For the first time she noticed that her Walkman 
had fallen out of the backpack and her headphones were no longer on her 
head. Curiously she scooped up the device and turned it over in her 
hands. It did not seem broken and when she pressed the play button the 
sound of &quot;Tears for Fears&quot; blazed forth from the headphones, singing, 
&quot;Shout&quot;. With a shrug she placed the phones back on her head and picked 
up her bike, with the Walkman in hand. The bike did not seem damaged so 
she jumped back on and speed off to school, hoping that she would not be 
too late. 

Before long she broke out of the trees to find herself on the school&#39;s 
back lot, where the gym classes were usually held on good days. The 
sight of many kids still trickling towards the school gave Samantha a 
good feeling. She hated being late more than anything else in the world, 
because it meant one more thing for her mother to argue about. She 
pushed hard on the pedals and sailed across the field on her way towards 
the bike racks. As she glided her bike into an empty spot at the bike 
rack she heard someone called out to her over the music. 

&quot;Hey Sam!!&quot; A smiling girl with long wavy blonde hair and similar taste 
in clothing called out from the shadow of a tree. &quot;I was beginning to 
wonder if you were going to make it on time.&quot; She said as she approached 
her friend. 

&quot;Hey Trish!&quot; Samantha returned the greeting as she pulled the headphones 
around her neck, then took a U-lock off the bike and wrapped it around 
the back tire and the frame of the bike before latching it to the bike 
rack, &quot;I almost didn&#39;t.&quot; Samantha admitted bleakly, glancing at the girl 
occasionally. 

Tristan&#39;s smile faded the moment she say the red mark on the girl&#39;s face 
and the dirt stains on the side of her jeans, &quot;You alright?&quot; She 
inquired anxiously, &quot;Were you in an accident?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Samantha gave her friend a half smile, &quot;Just crashed in the 
woods.&quot; She explained simply. 

Tristan gave the girl a sceptical look, but did not push the matter, 
&quot;Thought you were the goddess of those trails.&quot; She remarked 
confidently, &quot;I don&#39;t think you have crashed since we were in grade 
three.&quot; 

Samantha rubbed the back of her head in embarrassment, &quot;That is not 
true. Anyway, this new bike is a monster to handle, it glides nicely, 
but breaking is a pain. I will tame it before the year ends I&#39;m sure of 
that.&quot; She patted the black sit of the bike proudly before starting 
towards the school, &quot;Something really weird just happened to me in the 
woods.&quot; She stated, thinking over the incident with the toad and 
consider how she would explain thing to Trish. 

Trish was the only person Sam truly trusted and even let the girl in on 
her little secret. The girl had been at her side longer then she could 
recall and she was like a sister to Sam, in fact most mistaken them for 
siblings until they took a closer look at the girls. The fact that they 
tended to share the same taste in fashion did not help matter much 
either. As far as Sam could tell the only difference between the two of 
them were their eyes. While Sam&#39;s were vibrant green and large, too 
large in Sam&#39;s opinion, Trish had smaller brown eyes that usually 
avoided intruding gazes with a glance to the floor. Sam was the only one 
lucky enough to peer within those eyes to stare upon the amber flecks 
the resided along the edges of Trish&#39;s eyes, making them appear to burn 
with a pain that Trish refused to allow out.  

 &quot;Hmm?&quot; Tristan grabbed her bag from its spot against the tree as they 
passed it, &quot;You see a ghost in there or something?&quot; She nervously 
glanced towards the forest as she swung the pack over her left shoulder 
and shuddered at the idea. 

&quot;Noooo...&quot; Samantha said sarcastically, she could never understand why 
her friend had such a fear of ghosts or why she refused to enter any 
forested area for that matter. It was as if the girl thought some kind 
of ghoulish creature might leap out at her or something. &quot;Nothing like 
that. It was just a toad.&quot; Sam assured the girl, still milling over the 
event, &quot;It kept staring at me. It felt weird.&quot; 

Tristan eyed her friend, &quot;Annnd?&quot; She probed knowingly, her eyes wide 
with wonder. When they were young and the sun descended in the distance 
as they walked the twisting paths that made up the neighbourhood Trish 
would cling tightly to Sam&#39;s arm, pointing at every approaching shadow 
to be certain no ghost lingered within their depths. Even with her 
intense fear she wanted to know if Sam saw anything at all, almost as if 
she teetered between fear and wonderment. 

&quot;And nothing.&quot; Samantha stated with a shrug, chuckling at the 
disappointed sigh that emitted from her friend&#39;s lips. &quot;I nearly ran 
over the thing and crashed when I tried to avoid it is all.&quot; 

&quot;Somehow I don&#39;t believe that was all.&quot; Tristan remarked knowingly, they 
had known each other since they were in kindergarten and Tristan knew 
that anything involving animals and Samantha was never just nothing. She 
still remembered how her friend had calmed an angry tomcat that had a 
broken leg. While everyone else ended up scratched by the cat Samantha 
simply knelt out of reach of the creature and stared at it. Within 
moment the cat was purring and curled up in Samantha&#39;s lap, &quot;Come on, 
this is me you are talking to.&quot; She begged, &quot;Tell me what really 
happened.&quot; 

&quot;Alright.&quot; Samantha took a deep breath and glanced around to make sure 
no one else was listening to her, &quot;I was riding my bike through the 
woods, listening to that mix tape you gave me, when I heard someone yell 
out, &#39;Stop&#39;, out of nowhere. I slammed on my breaks and nearly flew over 
the handlebars, doing an endo, when I noticed this toad right in front 
of my front wheel. It was like the world stopped and the two of us were 
staring at each other. I somehow got this feeling the toad was the one 
that called out to me.&quot; 

&quot;A toad?&quot; Tristan gave her friend a peculiar look, &quot;Did you hit it?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Samantha said gratefully and continued on with her story, &quot;I 
missed the toad but crashed the bike. Strange thing is the toad just 
kept staring at me the whole time.&quot; 

&quot;You sure it was the toad that called out to you?&quot; Tristan inquired as 
they found their lockers and began to fiddle with the combination lock. 

&quot;Yeah, I got this feeling that it was.&quot; Samantha opened her locker and 
pulled out a textbook and shoved it into her backpack. 

&quot;Did you try to talk to it?&quot; 

Samantha flushed in embarrassment, &quot;Yeah... but it didn&#39;t say another 
word. It was like it wanted to say more but I couldn&#39;t hear it. I&#39;m just 
being stupid I guess.&quot; 

Tristan grabbed a few of her books, &quot;It could have been someone else, 
couldn&#39;t it?&quot; She inquired in search of any other answer to the mystery.

Samantha shrugged, &quot;It felt like it came from inside of my head. It&#39;s 
just too weird.&quot; She stated with a shudder.

Tristan patted her friend on the shoulder, &quot;I always knew you were weird 
so don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; She reassured her friend.

Samantha gave the girl a smirk, &quot;Gee, Thanks.&quot; 

Suddenly the bell rang and kids began to rush to their classes, &quot;I&#39;ll 
talk to you at lunch alright?&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Samantha waved to her friend, who returned the wave, then headed 
off to her class.
