<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch53.html">Back to Part 53</a><pre>&quot;Jessica, you have to do something.&quot; Jenn cried out as Kim&#39;s screams 
filled the room and she faded to a point that only her silhouette could 
be seen on the ground, &quot;Can&#39;t you see she&#39;s dying?&quot; 

Jessica stared at Kimberly as she writhed on the floor, &quot;What am I 
supposed to do?&quot; She inquired frantically, &quot;I&#39;m scared.&quot; 

Amy held the girl by the shoulders and looked her in the eyes, &quot;You need 
to go back into your nightmare and face it.&quot; 

&quot;I can&#39;t&quot; Jessica cried. 

&quot;J... jessie...&quot; Natalie clutch at her chest, &quot;I... I know you can do 
it.&quot; 

&quot;You are stronger then you think.&quot; Amy commented, &quot;You fought with this 
nightmare for over half a decade and survived. You are the only one who 
can face it now.&quot;

Jessica let out a sigh of defeat, &quot;Fine.&quot; She finally agreed, &quot;What do I 
need to do?&quot; 

&quot;Just sleep.&quot; Amy rushed around the couch to pick up her bag where she 
left it, &quot;I can give you a sedative to help you get to sleep, but from 
there you are on your own.&quot; 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Alyson interjected, &quot;Kim and Penny will be there as well. 
If you can snap them out of the dream they will be able to help you 
escape.&quot; 

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be dangerous?&quot; Jenn inquired anxiously, &quot;Couldn&#39;t she get 
lost between dreams?&quot; 

&quot;Not likely.&quot; Alyson replied, &quot;Seeing as Jessica is already upset by 
these dreams it is most likely that she will simply find herself back in 
the nightmare.&quot; She looked Jessica into the eye, &quot;You have to remind 
yourself it is a dream or you will be pulled in and not be able to free 
them.&quot; She stated urgently. 

Amy pulled out a needle and a bottle of sedative, &quot;I sure hope you are 
right because we could loss them both if not.&quot; She remarked, and then 
plunged the needle into the bottle and pulled the plunger back, &quot;You 
ready Jessica.&quot; 

Jessica held out her arm to Amy, &quot;Do it quickly. Before I change my 
mind.&quot; Amy swabbed the girl&#39;s arm with a cotton ball soaked in rubbing 
alcohol before slipping the needle under the girl&#39;s skin. 

&quot;It will only take a few minutes so you might want to lay down.&quot; Amy 
suggested, &quot;And try to think of that house.&quot;

Jessica frowned, &quot;I wish that was hard to do.&quot; She could feel her body 
already relaxing as she settled onto a couch. Her eyes fell upon Jenn 
and she smiled at the girl, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I tried to take Kris from you.&quot; 
She stated with a long face, &quot;She really does love you. I just wish I 
could find someone who loves me as she loves you.&quot; She felt her mind 
begin to drift, &quot;Ple...ase... don&#39;t... be angry... with her...&quot; She felt 
herself begin to drift to sleep. .

&quot;Good luck.&quot; Amy lightly pet the girl&#39;s head, &quot;Keep safe.&quot;

*****

Kim&#39;s body floated in the tub of steaming water, lying perfectly still 
as to allow the warmth to seep through her bones, the steam filling her 
nostril and clearing her mind. Abruptly the memory of Penny&#39;s kiss 
drifted through her head and she smiled at the thought of those soft 
lips against her own. The kiss felt so warms and sweet that she wanted 
to continue kissing her even more, then she frowned as images of the 
other things she did to Penny entered her mind again. The feeling of the 
girl&#39;s smooth skin under her fingertips and the way her heart pounded 
while being forced to have sex with the girl. She recalled how Penny 
moved under her touch and she flushed, she had never felt so excited 
before in her life. She wondered what it would be like to feel Penny&#39;s 
fingers inside of her and shook her head against the idea. She quickly 
dunked her head under the water in an attempt to wash the memories away. 
She wanted to be rid of those emotions and vigorously rubbed at her arms 
in an attempt to free herself from dirty feeling, wishing to never think 
of those feelings again.

Under the surface of the water she felt safe, the warmth wrapped around 
her body and hugged her gentle. She held her breath and allowed herself 
to float under the surface with her eyes lightly closed. She wished she 
could stay beneath the surface, with its welcoming embrace, forever. 
Never having to face her father or those men again. She considered 
releasing her breath to allow the clear liquid to enter her mouth and 
fill her lungs, to let the grim reaper take her soul and take her away 
from the nightmares of reality.

As she pondered her existence and the pros and cons of her actions, 
eternal darkness or the blissful feeling of Penny&#39;s soft embrace, she 
felt something icy slip around her wrist. Her eyes fluttered open to 
find herself surrounded by darkness and the only light emitting from the 
tub, which now hovered several metres above her head. Panic overtook her 
mind as she realized that she really was going to drown and would never 
be able to see her sisters again. She tried to swim towards the light 
when she felt something tug on her arm. She glanced down to see a dark 
shadow writhing below her like a thin cloth caught up in a strong 
breeze, piece of which had wrapped itself around her wrist and refused 
to let her go. She grabbed at the thing to find her hand passed right 
through it, however it did not release her arm. Out of the centre of the 
black mass floated up a bone white oval object. A porcelain mask with no 
features other then a pair of empty slights for eyes and several small 
black curved markings around them, however Kim was sure that it was 
observing her with those void eye sockets as it drifted toward her.

Terror now gripped the girl&#39;s heart as the mask moved ever so much 
closer. She tried to scream only to find her voice drowned out by the 
dark waters that surrounded her. As the mask floated closer she noticed 
that the black cloth seemed to follow it as if they were an entity of 
its own, forming a pair of shoulders and a hood around the mask. Then 
before Kim&#39;s eyes something slunk out from behind the mask. Kim watched 
in horror as she realized that what she was seeing was a piece of flesh 
crawling across the mask. She could make out an eyebrow and closed 
eyelid in the middle the writhing skin as it slithered over the left eye 
of the mask. The moment is settled into place the eyelid abruptly opened 
to reveal a gleaming yellow eye staring up at Kim. A few loose fragments 
of flesh formed where the lips should have been and started to move into 
what appeared to be a sinister grin.

&quot;Eeevv..venning... P..pri...incess..sssss...&quot; It gurgled in the water as 
the eye set upon Kimberly&#39;s face. From the way the skin flickered around 
the month Kim sensed that the creature was smiling at her, &quot;Ddooo.. 
yo...ouuu.... n...noot... re...re...remme...mmeber me, Myy... 
sweeetttt...?&quot; It inquired darkly. 

Kim began to shake her head when her eyes fell upon a deep gash across 
the mask that ran from above the right eye across the bridge of the 
nose. A memory flashed through her mind, an image of a teenaged girl 
with long blonde hair and a long blade extending from the sleeve of her 
black leather jacket. The girl leapt through the air at a large man and 
slashed at his face, cutting it open revealing a porcelain mask,  
&quot;Akaime!!&quot; Kimberly snarled at the creature, forgetting her fear and the 
fact that she was submerged underwater.

Akaime smiled, &quot;So glad you remember me,&quot; The remains of his face 
twisted in anger, &quot;Because it was you that reduced me to this 
deteriorated state.&quot; He exclaimed irately, shaking the girl through the 
murky water like a rag doll, &quot;Because of you and that hunter I have been 
reduced to feeding off these feeble children&#39;s fears.&quot;

Kim stared at the creature in shocked appal, &quot;You&#39;re the reason they are 
trapped here.&quot; She suddenly realized. 

&quot;It is not I that keeps them here.&quot; Akaime protested honestly, &quot;It is 
their own fears that entraps them. I simply stumbled upon them after you 
so rudely tricked me and that Dream Ghoul ate me. I cannot believe I 
have been reduced to feeding off children&#39;s fears again. Then again 
there is nothing as delectable as your fears, my dear princess. You are 
a meal that I will drink slowly and will enjoy ever morsel.&quot; 

Suddenly Kim recalled what it was she was staring at, it was this 
creature that used to sit at the corner of her bed watching her father 
molest her. She could feel it drinking from her fears as it hovered 
behind her father like a grim shadow and now it has returned for her, 
however this time it would finish her off. The idea of this creature 
gaining delight from her suffering angered her, and then she thought of 
it lurking in the safety of the darkness behind the flash of camera 
lights, feeding on her sister&#39;s terror. This infuriated her to no end 
and she found herself glaring at the creature as the mask glided up 
close to her face. 

&quot;When I am finished with you I will feed on your little friends.&quot; Akaime 
smacked his lips hungrily, &quot;Then, as soon as I&#39;m at my full strength I 
will return to finish off Natalie and all of your other friend.&quot; He let 
out an inane laugh that caused the liquid around them to shake. 

Kim watched as the creature swam boldly closer to her and she grinned 
maliciously, &quot;I will not let you ever hurt my friend again.&quot; With the 
creature mere inches from her face Kim plunged her fist into the centre 
of what she suspected was its chest. Akaime&#39;s face contorted to an 
expression that could only be described as a mix of confusion and alarm. 

His inky body wrapped around Kim in an attempt to strangle the girl, 
&quot;Let go of me you disgusting little girl.&quot; He snarled, struggling to 
free her arm from his chest, &quot;Or... or I will kill you quickly, then 
make your friend truly suffer.&quot;

However she felt little fear for the monster anymore. If he had the 
strength to kill her he would have done it already instead of writhing 
around like a fish on a hook. Her heart was filled with a need to 
protect Penny and all of her friend from this monster in the night; she 
wanted to keep him from ever feeding off her friends ever again. 
Redoubling her efforts she lunged her other fist deeper into the 
darkness until her fingers touched something silky and smooth with a 
piece of metal attached to it. The moment her fingers wrapped around the 
object Akaime began to violently trash about, trying to pull away from 
the girl. 

&quot;N... NOOOO!!!&quot; Akaime screamed out, &quot;Let go of that!!!&quot; He demanded, 
frantically flailing about.

Regardless of the creatures screams of protest Kim held a firm grip on 
the object within his black body. She kicked out at the creature, 
swimming through the darkness, as she yanked at the item in an attempt 
to free it from its inky prison. Akaime swam directly at Kim&#39;s face, the 
mask splitting open down the middle to reveal a set of gleaming ragged 
teeth. 

&quot;I don&#39;t care what Draigo thinks of you.&quot; Akaime hissed angrily, &quot;I will 
kill you here and now!!&quot; He hollered. 

Kim gave the object another quick tuck and watched as the mask distort, 
shifting before her into a face filled with agony and terror. She almost 
felt sorry for the creature and considered letting the item go when she 
saw the glimmer of a gold star about the size of her palm emerge from 
the depths of the monster&#39;s chest. 

&quot;Penny&#39;s belt!!&quot; She cheered out in amazement. This monster had it all 
the time; he was the reason for Penny being trapped in this nightmare 
after all. She intensified her efforts to recover the item, her promise 
to reclaim the belt for Penny filling her heart, giving her even more 
strength. With one finally tug the belt came free and the creature 
quickly swam away from the girl, disappearing into the darkness. Kim 
glanced down at the object in her hand; it was a long blue silken belt 
with a large golden star connected to one end. She really did it, she 
found Penny&#39;s belt just as she promised. She smiled at the item happily 
when darkness began to seep into her mind. She had forgotten that she 
was underwater and could feel herself slowly being pulled into obscurity 
below. She may have won against the creature, however she lost her 
battle with death. 

Suddenly an arm burst through the surface of the water and grabbed Kim 
by the arm. Hastily Kim&#39;s body was dragged upwards and within moments 
she burst through the surface of the water, gasping for air. 

&quot;Kim! Are you alright?!?&quot; Amber anxiously inquired as she pulled the 
girl out of the tub and onto the floor. 

Kim gave a wearied glance around the room to see Penny and Sarah 
standing in the door to the room, she held the belt out to Penny, &quot;Y... 
you... are free...&quot; She weakly smiled then collapsed in Amber&#39;s arms.
