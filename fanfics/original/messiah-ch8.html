(Who... am I...?)

WHO ARE YOU

(What... am I...?)

WHAT ARE YOU

(...I am...)

...YOU ARE...

***********

&quot;...Rain... Harland...&quot;

**********

A bitter chill.

That was the first thing Rain noticed. And his eyes could barely adjust 
to his surroundings now. Mostly because he was so sure that this was all 
just some odd delusion.  Whether or not that was true remained to be 
seen. The young man stood alone in a cold void of darkness. One much 
colder than any winter and darker than any night. He could barely see 
anything within three feet of himself (had there been anything there 
been anything there for him to see). Rain looked upon himself and knew 
that he was naked. The clothing he had worn was gone. The setting of 
Green Cloud in flames was gone. The smell of the smoke and the heat of 
the fire had vanished along with it. Though those were not sights he 
wanted often to see, Rain could not help but ask;

&quot;Where am I?&quot;

A spotlight fell from above to a point just twelve metres ahead of him. 
A younger version of Rain (about ten or eleven) was enveloped in the 
newly provided light. Child Rain stood in place, his clothes ripped and 
his eyes haunted with grief, shock, anger and heartbreak. As well as the 
wafting stink of blood clinging to his dirty clothes. A look of horror 
passed over Teenage Rain&#39;s face when Child Rain looked over at him with 
that haunted expression. The older one knew, implicitly, what had caused 
it. But Teenage Rain could not help but ask;

&quot;...Who are you?&quot;

Child Rain stifled his sobs and answered. &quot;...I&#39;m R-Rain Harland...&quot;

&quot;What are you?&quot; The teen asked the child.

Child Rain&#39;s head drooped. &quot;...I&#39;m... I am... you.&quot;

Once again the broken, tainted mirror was stared at. The pre-pubescent 
boy looking into the eyes of the post-pubescent man. Child Rain and 
Teenage Rain gazed at each other with confusion, sadness, not 
understanding how or why any of this was happening. They were the two, 
twin edges of the same coin. These were two opposing yet interconnected 
faces of Rain Harland. 

**********

&quot;WHAT AM I?&quot; 

**********

* Why am I here? Why am I seeing myself like this?!

**********

...rain harland...

**********

*  That boy is your true face

**********

&quot;WHAT AM I?&quot; 

**********

* That me... is the same as me...?

**********

...Rain Harland...

**********

* Correct.

**********

&quot;WHAT AM I?&quot; 

**********

* I don&#39;t want to be that boy anymore! I want to be brave!

**********

...RAIN HARLAND... 

**********

* So why are you still so afraid?

**********

&quot;WHAT AM I?&quot; 

**********

* Afraid?

**********

...rAIN hARLAND... 

**********

* To face yourself. Your true self. 

**********

&quot;WHAT AM I?&quot; 

**********

* I don&#39;t want to be that way... anymore

**********

...nIAR dNALRAH... 

**********

* Yet you are still afraid.

**********

&quot;WHAT AM I?&quot; 

**********

*  What do I have to do... to escape it?

**********

...dNALRAH nIAR ... 

**********

* You must face yourself. 

**********

&quot;WHO AM I?&quot; 

**********

* Face myself?

**********

...hARLAND rAIN...

**********

*  Yes. Face your true self to emancipate your heart. 

**********

&quot;WHO AM I?&quot; 

**********

* Then... what will happen? 

**********

...HARLAND RAIN...

**********

* You shall take your true place, oh Second Star, the Catcher of Death.  

**********

&quot;WHO AM I?&quot; 

**********

*  My true place? My destiny?

**********

...Harland Rain...

**********

* Yes.  

**********

&quot;WHO AM I?&quot; 

**********

* What is my destiny?

**********

...harland rain...

**********

* To become the destroyer of the world. Thus you must...

**********

&quot;...OPEN THE DOOR...&quot;

**********

Shortly ahead of Child Rain appeared a door. Another spotlight fell on 
it when it did. Teenage Rain stared at it just like he had done his 
counterpart. Something told him to go to it. And open it. Something was 
calling him from inside it, something cold and yet... important. He 
could not resist that will. Even though he wanted to. Rain found his 
feet moving him forward against his immediate will. But eventually he 
began to accept this turn of events, and stopped resisting it. Teenage 
Rain walked passed Child Rain casually and stepped before that wooden 
door connected to nothing. He gripped the doorknob and pulled it open, 
light and wind pouring out from it like the release of Pandora&#39;s Box. 
Rain squinted and stepped forwards, into that vortex of illumination. 
And the door closed behind him.

Child Rain then vanished. And three more spotlights fell down in his 
place. Three hooded men known as the Triad of the Inquisition. But their 
forms were not solid. They were transparent and partially clear, unable 
to be touched but perfectly able to move and speak, as well as interact. 
These entities were not the Triad themselves, but more like the spectral 
&#39;representations&#39; of the Triad. The Sages of the Modern Era stood around 
the door like a triangle. Knowing what it was that Rain Harland had just 
done. And what it was that would become once he stepped out of that 
door.

The representation of Aherg gazed forwards at the door. &quot;The boy has 
entered the door of his memories. This is good. We were not able to 
intervene in the Gnosis of the Eros or Geist Fahlem, but with this one 
it is different. He is a true Ashtar. The very existence of him spits in 
the face of the ancient Novus Deus... but he is truly instrumental in 
the creation of the new world.&quot;

&quot;That being said,&quot; Stated the representation of Ein, &quot;the Diablos now 
continues to coalesce with his Qi, even in its adolescent state. Do we 
all realize what that might mean?&quot;

The representation of Karahi nodded. &quot;The boy has gone beyond us 
already. He will soon be an Ishtar, like Fahlem. He will be one that 
vastly transcends our own plane of Demi-Gnosis. There is little doubt of 
it now. Rain Harland is the one worthy enough to be our second 
Archangel. He is the man who will bring an end to the Sermo Period and 
usher in the next phase.&quot;

&quot;He may be the De Anima,&quot; Aherg&#39;s representation said, &quot;but he is only 
one node on the game board. Don&#39;t forget the other two.&quot;

Ein&#39;s representation shook its head. &quot;Fear not. There is no turning back 
for the Princess. Her memories and life as Leah Cloud are over. No 
better Redeemer could have been fashioned for us. Fahlem&#39;s work extends 
to far more than just our Gods of Wrath. And if the Eros is or is not 
the De Mundo, that needn&#39;t trouble us until the new world has taken 
shape.&quot;

&quot;That is true,&quot; Claimed Karahi&#39;s representation, &quot;but we cannot let her 
die until we know. And it seems that failure of an Archangel, the 
Thanatos, has set his sights on her. Their powers might not be equal... 
but the Raum is fully capable of assuming its Arcanum form now. Just as 
the Oriax is.&quot;

Aherg&#39;s representation chuckled softly. &quot;If she is the De Mundo, then 
her death will not come now. Besides. If Celaph was correct about 
anything then it had to be the worthlessness of the Thanatos. Powerful 
though he is, he is far too caught up in that power to possess sound 
judgement. Becoming synonymous with the Heart of the Astaroth was merely 
a stroke of luck. There is no way he could attain Gnosis. And he will 
not be able to defeat the Eros until he achieves that level. Thus we 
need not worry. What is truly of concern now is the Elymus Drive and the 
one who will activate it. And soon he will be ready for that task. It is 
very ironic. The boy is clearly an embodiment of the Astaroth and the 
multiplicity of its Seed. Yet he will bring about the Third Redemption&quot;

The representation of Aherg looked over to the single door that Rain had 
entered through. &quot;Hmph. Well, the end justifies the means in this case. 
So hurry and learn of your true self, oh Catcher of Death. The grand 
stage of destiny awaits you.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Yumi? Yumi? Hey, come on. Wake up, kid.&quot;

The Mishima girl moaned irritably in her sleep when she felt someone&#39;s 
strong hand ruffle her by the shoulder. Ever since that event six months 
ago, she had been sleeping better. Insomnia was no longer a problem for 
Yumi since the awakening of her Qi. But also it made her crabby when 
someone woke her now. Fortunately she was aware of herself enough to 
know that bigger things were already at work for her to consider 
handling. Yumi&#39;s bright blue eyes flapped opened slowly at the sound of 
the voice of the one trying to awaken her. She knew that voice to be 
Terry&#39;s. The half-German, half-American teen-adult stood next to Yumi&#39;s 
bed with a frown on his face. It was like this practically everyday. But 
today was a little more important than others. Mostly because of what 
had happened at Green Cloud yesterday. 

Yumi yawned impolitely into her fist and eased up the headboard of her 
bed, looking over to her blonde-haired friend. &quot;...T-Terry? What time is 
it?&quot;

&quot;About half past nine,&quot; He stated, &quot;you&#39;ve been out like a light since 
we got back from Green Cloud.&quot;

Yumi&#39;s eyes then turned serious when she thought about that. About what 
happened at that quiet American Village. Out of nowhere, Freeman Ronove 
had attacked with his Meta Suit, Raum. He destroyed buildings, homes and 
lives like they were nothing at all. He went so far as to bring directly 
himself before Yumi, Terry, Rain and the Saffron Family, proclaiming his 
hatreds and racism towards humanity. And when Yumi refused to fight him 
in a place that would bring destruction to innocent lives, Freeman took 
his wrath out on the Saffron Family. He shot them down in cold blood 
with the Gatlings of his Raum Meta Suit. All of them were killed; 
Edwina, Kurt, and Bella, before they even had the chance to make it to 
the Leviathan. Another cold act of brutality that simply defined what 
Freeman Ronove was. An unstable maniac, drunk on his own power and the 
destiny given to him by it. Just thinking about Freeman unsettled Yumi&#39;s 
stomach. She knew what he had done to her in Ix Nos Babel. Though the 
drugs administered to her blood clouded her mind and made her think she 
was sleeping with Chizu/Chizuru, in actuality she was sexually assaulted 
by the Thanatos. He did it not for sexual gratification (though he 
probably experienced it) but rather to inseminate Yumi to give birth to 
a new Novus Deus. But instead Yumi had produced another Vulnus Deus. 

Yumi&#39;s expression hardened. She had to do something about Freeman. He 
was still out there somewhere, she knew that the Leviathan&#39;s Gamma 
Cannons wouldn&#39;t be able to stop the Raum. And Freeman was waiting for 
her. 

&quot;What about Rain?&quot; Yumi stated, &quot;That spherical Qi anomaly that 
surrounded him was the same thing that happened to me in Ix Nos Babel. 
But will he be okay?&quot;

Terry shrugged. &quot;We don&#39;t know. After picking up the survivors of that 
bastard Freeman&#39;s attack, we had to leave Green Cloud. Freeman did a 
runner too, thankfully. But the Chrysalis personnel couldn&#39;t get Rain 
outta that thing. I know it&#39;s cruel to leave him behind but... there was 
nothing we could do. But you said the same thing happened to you, right?  
What was it like?&quot;

&quot;...Weird,&quot; Yumi stated, clutching her head as if she had a headache, &quot;I 
remember seeing all these images and reflections of my past. I remember 
someone or something whispering things to me. I can&#39;t recall all of it, 
but... what happened wasn&#39;t completely without its benefits. Once I 
escaped that thing I regained all my memories, my skills in Meta Suit 
piloting went up drastically... and I feel more... aware now. I don&#39;t 
know what it was that happened then, but, it wasn&#39;t all bad.&quot;

Terry nodded. Now he understood the cause of Yumi&#39;s change in 
personality. &quot;I guess that Rain should be okay then. That&#39;s good. I 
wouldn&#39;t wanna keep worrying about it in which case. Anyways, enough of 
that, we&#39;ve got bigger problems than just Freeman.&quot;

Yumi scratched the side of her head. &quot;We do?&quot;

&quot;Yup. Major Mariette will probably be better off in explaining it all to 
you, but, you should know from now that... Celaph and Chizu are here.&quot;

The hacker&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;...Celaph and... Chizu? Here?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. This is gonna be tough for you, I know, but we were going to meet 
up with them anyway. You better come up to the bridge so we can talk 
things through with them.&quot;

Yumi nodded slowly. It was painful seeing Chizu Yagata the last time. 
But she had managed to deal with it. Mostly for Terry&#39;s sake. If he 
suspected that she might still care for Chizu, then his feelings would 
be hurt. Thus she had to do this. The Japanese teen climbed out of her 
plain white bed and ambled over to her side bathroom in nothing more 
than her Meta Tokyo Zappers sweatshirt. She walked into the circular 
podium of her door-less bathroom, removed her sweatshirt and then 
vocally called out &#39;shower on&#39;. The voice recognition box on the far 
wall received that command and a cylinder-shaped formation of glass 
descended around her naked torso. The warm water came down to her skin a 
moment later. Steam began to rise. About twenty minutes later the shower 
was over. Yumi re-dressed herself in her green and silver Chrysalis 
Lieutenant&#39;s uniform. Then she left with Terry beside her. One the way 
to the bridge, Yumi dropped a few coins in a vending machine and bought 
a snack bar for breakfast. And before she left she ate it. Discussions 
with New Protocol tended to be quite elongated, and she didn&#39;t want her 
stomach groaning throughout the entire thing. Once she was finished, 
Yumi tossed the wrapper in a litter bin and ascended to the bridge of 
the Leviathan with Terry alongside her. Once they entered they saw just 
who they expected to see. The four helmsmen and women manning the 
controls and frontal computers of the ship, with Colonel Cecelia Faye 
Beatrix handing out her orders. As usual, Major Sophia Mariette was not 
too far from the colonel. But there were two additions to the group on 
the bridge that were eliciting mixed reactions. 

Those two people were Commander William Ank Celaph, leader of New 
Protocol. As well as his informant, consort and fianc&#130;e, Chizu Yagata. 
The crew of Chrysalis did not have short memories. Many of them hated 
Protocol with a passion in the old days. So they found it hard to have 
Celaph on their ship without expression that anger. But a special kind 
of hatred was reserved for Chizu. Her betrayal, the betrayal that caused 
the deaths of thousands of EDEN citizens months ago, had damaged their 
faith in her. Beatrix had never liked her in the beginning, but Chizu&#39;s 
actions back then had earned her a new kind of hatred from the colonel 
of the ship. Terry felt the same way, but for both of them. Sophia and 
Yumi were the only ones that tried to retain any neutral sentiments in 
the given situation. Though seeing Chizu again was something that 
carried its own edge in Yumi&#39;s unmistakably fragile heart. Her sky blue 
eyes ducked away, unwilling to gaze at Chizu again. It was plain to 
everyone that Yumi still retained feelings for her.

Especially to Terry.

Celaph nodded to Yumi. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Miss Mishima.&quot;

&quot;...Yes. A long time.&quot;

Chizu seemed to take note of Yumi but said nothing to her. Not even 
under Celaph&#39;s silent ushering. That caught Terry as odd, but, he didn&#39;t 
say or do anything about it. 

Sophia shifted her glasses. &quot;I&#39;m glad you could join us, Lieutenant 
Mishima. Since you weren&#39;t here before, and since Lieutenant Hennig is 
so bad at explanations, I&#39;ll brief you on the situation. At 12.13, 
Pacific Time, an unknown Meta Suit descended on the village of Green 
Cloud and instigated an attack. This much you know. That same suit 
wrecked over 67% of the village, leaving behind only eleven survivors, 
excluding Rain Harland. After we retreated from the valley that Green 
Cloud was built in, the Divine Blade of the Holy Protocol Army entered 
into the caverns, according to the reports of our spies. By now they 
will have assumed control over the Sky Cord. Which means our mission is 
a failure.&quot;

Yumi bobbed her head. &quot;...I understand, Major.&quot;

&quot;Holy Protocol has the upper hand,&quot; Celaph said, &quot;the North American Sky 
Cord is the fastest running Sky Cord on the planet. It would take less 
than fifteen hours for them to leap through the stratosphere on it. I 
just never expected Freeman Ronove to intercede on this occasion.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Beatrix asked. 

&quot;Because our doctors confirmed that he is mentally unstable. Of course 
there are a great deal of intravenous drugs that have periodical mental 
anaesthetizing properties in them. But none we tested were strong enough 
to control his psychological imbalance. How is it possible that he could 
pilot a Meta Suit in that condition?&quot;

Yumi looked over at him. &quot;The Raum is like my Oriax, isn&#39;t it? Our suits 
run on more than just mental control. Their performance is determined by 
our Qi.&quot;

&quot;So what?&quot; Terry barked, &quot;When we face off with Freeman again, I&#39;ll kill 
him myself. But I&#39;m not thinking about that now. What I wanna know is 
what took these two so frickin&#39; long to make it here.&quot;

Sophia narrowed her eyes. &quot;Lieutenant!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Chizu declared, &quot;we did get ourselves delayed. You see, 
since the Holy Empire of Protocol have control over the Divine Blade, 
New Protocol has spent over 6 billion credits in the training of pilots 
and the building of mecha for a new Meta Suit force to counter the DB. 
That force has been dubbed the New Protocol Meta Suit Division, or 
&#39;NPMSD&#39; for short. Right now they are stationed in Meta Paris, France, 
for the coming battle.&quot;

Beatrix pressed her hand against her hip. &quot;The coming battle?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Celaph answered, &quot;it is obvious that we will not be able to stop 
the Holy Protocolian forces from ascending into space. The only way we 
can stop them from seizing the Lunar Station now is to face them in 
space before they ever make it to the base. In which case, Meta Suit 
conflict is unavoidable.&quot;

Sophia nodded. &quot;I see. So this NPMSD of yours, were they stationed in 
France because of the Western European Sky Cord?&quot;

Chizu answered that one. &quot;Correct. It&#39;s the fastest overall Sky Cord 
next to the North American one. However if we are to be successful in 
stopping the Divine Blade then we will need support from your Meta Suit 
military.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s understandable,&quot; Beatrix affirmed, &quot;and we can provide that. Our 
Uvalls and Gusions are already online for battle. However none of our 
Meta Suits, with the slight exception of them have any form of 
space-flight capabilities. To install the software and upgrade the suits 
for that would take sometime.&quot;

&quot;At least a full two days.&quot; Sophia added. 

Celaph crossed his arms. &quot;...We can&#39;t wait that long. This might be a 
problem.&quot;

&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Chizu commented, &quot;only slight modifications are 
needed for space flight on Gusion-models. If we left the Uvalls you have 
in reserve then we could speed up the counter-process.&quot;

&quot;But wouldn&#39;t that limit our overall force?&quot; Sophia supposed. 

Terry sighed for no reason in particular. &quot;Given the circumstances, I 
don&#39;t think we have too much of a choice. If we waste too much time then 
the Divine Blade&#39;ll take over the Lunar Station. We can&#39;t let that 
happen, right?&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Beatrix confirmed her input, &quot;we&#39;ll begin modifications on 
the Gusions as soon as this meeting is over. But that does leave one 
throbbing question. Exactly how are we going to go about this 
situation?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s very much up to you,&quot; Celaph said to Beatrix, &quot;in times gone by 
you were a brilliant tactician, Cecilia. I think that should hold up 
well today, also. I will not be on the bridge to help command you, 
anyway.&quot;

Sophia wriggled her nose with surprise when she heard, for the first 
time, someone other than herself and Father Bartholomeus refer to 
Beatrix as &#39;Cecelia&#39;. But that was not Beatrix&#39;s concern at this point. 
What bothered her was the fact that Celaph would not be commanding this 
operation alongside her and Sophia. &quot;Celaph?&quot;

Chizu sighed, catching Yumi&#39;s attention, then said, &quot;The Commander has 
decided to fight on the battlefield alongside the troops. That was one 
of the reasons we were delayed in reaching America. Preparations for his 
Meta Suit, the Orobas, took a bit longer than expected.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re fighting?&quot; Beatrix said curiously, &quot;...I should have expected 
it.&quot;

Celaph pulled a smile before his old friend. &quot;Old habits die hard, 
right? I am still a soldier at heart, after all. I assume it&#39;s the same 
for you from time to time.&quot;

Beatrix smiled back. &quot;Fine. Then it&#39;s settled. I&#39;ve decided what the 
pattern of attack shall be. We&#39;ll strike the Divine Blade in a pincer 
movement. The New Protocol Meta Suit Division will launch up the Western 
European Sky Cord and position themselves in wait for the DB within the 
next 24 hours. Then the Chrysalis team will follow them and strike from 
the rear when the Divine Blade engage our first party. It might be 
cutting close but this strategy can work if we waste no time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s acceptable to me.&quot; Celaph said.

&quot;I agree.&quot; Chizu acknowledged.

Sophia smiled at her lover. &quot;Sound&#39;s good.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Terry said, &quot;I just hope the Englishman over there 
doesn&#39;t slow us down out on the battlefield.&quot;

Celaph grinned competitively. The only one who said nothing to agree 
with Beatrix&#39;s plan was Yumi, who had remained silent throughout the 
conversation. Terry, Sophia, and Chizu looked at her. Though she had 
become more confident and direct since her time in Ix Nos Babel, seeing 
Chizu again seemed to be having an effect on her. One that neither Terry 
nor Chizu could ignore. Yumi kept her eyes down, but stole one glance of 
Chizu when she had the chance. And she came to notice the large diamond 
ring on Chizu&#39;s left wedding ring finger. It had to be an engagement 
ring from Celaph. That thought in itself stirred up feelings in Yumi 
that she had sought to put away. And now that they were bubbling up 
again, she couldn&#39;t bare to face them. Yumi excused herself and quickly 
jogged out of the room via the automatic door. Terry&#39;s instinct was to 
immediately go after her, but he was restrained by Sophia. She grabbed 
his arm and shook her head for a no. She needed to be alone. 

Chizu sighed, crossing her arms, ignoring the dirty looks that were 
begin cast in her direction from Terry. The problems of Yumi Mishima 
were not resolved. In fact... they were just beginning.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Temple of Tlazolteotl.

It was an intimidating structure from a distance or from inside, by 
anyone&#39;s book. But the roof of the temple provided such a brilliant view 
of the landscape. Of the rolling hills and the rounded demi-mountains. 
That could be as calming a sight as the temple itself was a threatening 
one. So it wasn&#39;t hard to understand why Princess Ashura often came up 
to the roof of the temple to think. As she was doing now. The notional 
leader of the Holy Empire of Protocol stood astride the sandy stone 
balustrade that framed the 320-metre long roof of the Temple of 
Tlazolteotl. Her long and intricately designed dress clamoured around 
her ankles and sandals. They would get scuffed out here. But that was 
not Ashura&#39;s concern right now. Her only thought was for what would take 
place once her army made its way into space. But she was not the only 
one who could see that that destiny weighed heavily on her mind.

A man stood a short ways behind her. The same man who had addressed 
Freeman after his check-up in the temple&#39;s research labs. And that man 
was Dr. Geist Fahlem. He had forgone his scientists cloak for more 
casual wear this time around. A formal grey suit with an ornamental 
Japanese katana attached to his waist. It was a weapon of destruction, 
with somewhat of an unknown technological edge to it, but nonetheless 
her carried it with him when outside of the labs. Fahlem smiled softly 
at the pensive Ashura from behind, and then walked up beside her. 

Ashura blinked when she heard footsteps. &quot;...W-who... are you?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve forgotten me?&quot; Dr. Fahlem softened his smile, &quot;how cold. Have I 
changed so much since the old days? Moreover, a princess must not 
concern herself with the fates of the lower-borne, is that not so?&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t answer my question,&quot; The Princess stated, &quot;Who are you?&quot; 

Dr. Fahlem looked out into the distance. &quot;I am a man who has had a home 
in many places. Yet there is only one to which I feel connection. Inside 
the bosom of man&#39;s need to expand and discover. My place is that of 
science. Apropos... to enhance my own standing in that field... I was 
forced to betray my friend. As well as the four &#39;nieces&#39; and &#39;daughters&#39; 
that I had come to love.&quot;

Princess Ashura was still confused. &quot;?&quot;

&quot;I am not surprised that you cannot remember me,&quot; Geist stated, &quot;I 
assume that it will be the same for Miss Mishima when we finally meet 
again. We have all undergone changes. But for now... you can just call 
me Fahlem. Dr. Geist Fahlem.&quot;

Ashura observed this man closely. &quot;...It&#39;s odd. The way you speak... and 
the familiarity I feel when I see you... it seems as though we&#39;ve...&quot;

&quot;Met before?&quot; Fahlem answered, &quot;You&#39;d be right in that belief, Princess. 
But you of all people, needn&#39;t think of it. You&#39;ve grown beyond those 
times and become an intelligent and beautiful woman. I am so proud of 
what you&#39;ve become. All of you have matured.&quot;

&quot;Matured?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Fate is a cruel thing, on occasion. But it can also give birth to 
many wonderful things. Like you and Miss Mishima. Which is why it 
troubles me to see such a horrid frown on that exquisite visage of 
yours. Such a frown suits you not, Princess.&quot;

Princess Ashura tilted her head down. &quot;You know... what the Triad of the 
Inquisition intends in this mission, do you not?&quot;

Fahlem&#39;s expression became serious. &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;...If the Divine Blade... reaches Meshezabel and someone achieves the 
activation of the Elymus Drive, then...&quot;

&quot;...It is a heavy weight on your heart, I see,&quot; Fahlem stated, &quot;knowing 
what it is that the Triad of the Inquisition will allow. But the 
scriptures of the Sepher Yetzirah are clear to us. The forth world, 
Anthropos, must come into being. It is not a matter of choice anymore. 
Although Yumi Mishima unintentionally prevented this event for taking 
place six months ago... she could only prolong the third world, Sermo; 
not protect it. This is destiny. Grim as it maybe... this would happen 
with or without the ushering of the Triad.&quot;

Ashura sighed. &quot;...I just can&#39;t accept that. There must be another way.&quot;

&quot;I assure you, there isn&#39;t. The Catcher of Death will be born. And he 
will do the tyrannical work of fate. It is a terrible destiny for one so 
young to shoulder. But with death there comes resurrection. You of all 
people, should know that. And from that point on... it will be your role 
to guide us all.&quot;

Ashura watched Fahlem. &quot;What are you saying?&quot;

&quot;You know of the Sepher Yetzirah, one of the eighty-six located Tablets 
of Destiny. There is a concept on that tablet that pertains to three 
chosen people. It is called The Legend of the Three Stars. The star of 
birth is De Mundo (on the world). The star of death is De Anima (on the 
soul) and finally, the star of rebirth, De Caelo (on the heavens). It is 
those three Stars that shall be the light in the cosmos. The torch in 
the darkness. The chains that bind shall be broken. The evil incarnate 
that plagues us will be torn asunder. And thus God&#39;s absolution will 
descend.&quot;

&quot;What are you... talking about? I don&#39;t understand.&quot; Ashura stated. 

&quot;I know,&quot; Fahlem put forth, &quot;but you will. One day. It&#39;s a strange fate 
for us. Those of us who are synonymous with the Heart of the Astaroth. 
It all seems to be a cosmic, parable-like joke.&quot;

That comment, Ashura understood. &quot;...Are you saying that...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Princess. You and I are both Ashtars,&quot; Fahlem resumed his smile, 
&quot;but your road is noticeably more noteworthy and significant than my 
own. But that is to be expected from one who is De Caelo. You are the 
Third Star, Ashura. The Star of Resurrection. Once the current work of 
the Catcher of Death is completed... your role in this, will begin to 
take shape. Then you can truly forsake the name &#39;Leah Cloud&#39;.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

When Yumi was stressed out she often found herself staring at the Oriax. 
In the six months since she had escaped Meta Tokyo, she had grown 
attached to it. After what happened at Ix Nos Babel, it became important 
to her. As a form of protection, and also as a friend. Terry had often 
told her that he felt the same about his Bishamon, but that was 
different. The Bishamon M-2 was purely metallic. Oriax was not only 
metal and plastic. It was fashioned with DNA from the 40th Vulnus Deus. 
The Vulnus Deus that Yumi herself originated from. Thus she felt a deep 
connection to the suit. In some ways you could call it her relative. Of 
course, if that were the case, then that would also apply to Freeman, 
and the thought of that just sickened Yumi. No, to her, the Oriax was 
more than just the Oriax. And with the exceptions of Terry and Sophia, 
Yumi considered the suit to be her only true friend. 

It might have sounded odd, but, it was easy to love a machine with a 
&#39;soul&#39;.

Yumi stood at the lower surface of the Leviathan&#39;s Meta Suit hanger. Her 
arms were at her sides and her neck cranked back so she could get a good 
look at the Oriax from down there. All around her were the sounds of 
metal clanging against metal, oil being poured into fuel tanks, workers 
and technicians muttering to themselves about what work needed to be 
done on certain suits. A new addition to the Meta Suit hanger was the 
constant work being put into the Gusions by New Protocolian engineers. 
When Beatrix had said that modification of space-flight capabilities 
would commence as soon as the meeting was over, she hadn&#39;t been kidding.  
The workers from Celaph&#39;s rebel Protocolian group were already 
installing the space-flight software into the great number of Gusions on 
board. All things considered though, they had to be quick about all 
this. The Divine Blade was already on the move. If they made it to the 
Lunar Station and claimed the AM-Cannon then it was all over. Yumi and 
the Oriax had been quite successful in stopping the AM-Cannon from 
destroying Meta Cities six months ago, but there was no way she could 
keep that up indefinitely. 

While Yumi stared at her Meta Suit from below, a slow-moving Terry 
Hennig advanced on her from the right. The blonde man stepped up astride 
Yumi with a careful smile. He stuffed his hands into his pockets and 
followed her gaze, staring at the Oriax.

Terry was not oblivious to the tear tracks trailing down Yumi&#39;s cheeks. 
&quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;...No.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m sorry, Yumi,&quot; The Hennig boy said, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have let this 
happen. I should have just found a way to keep you out of this. But I 
swear to God, I didn&#39;t want to hurt you by seeing Chizu again.&quot;

Yumi bobbed her head. &quot;I know. You&#39;d never do that to me.&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; He affirmed, &quot;I just wish I could do something to make 
you feel a little better about all this.&quot;

&quot;There isn&#39;t anything you can do. But I do appreciate that you&#39;d want 
to. I know that I said that I could handle seeing Chizu again after 
everything that happened. And I truly believed that I could. But seeing 
her in mind... is different from seeing her in the flesh. All those 
feelings just came rushing back like a flood in an instant... all those 
times I remember being with her... watching her eat, watching her speak, 
watching her move, watching her laugh and complain. Back then... all I 
had to go on was my feelings. And it all came back to me. I know how 
pathetic is it. I hate that I still have these feelings.  After all, she 
betrayed me in the worst possible way. But seeing her like that... it 
just reminded me that I&#39;m not... over her. I still love her. And I can&#39;t 
help hating myself because I know that I shouldn&#39;t. For so many reasons 
than one.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m so sorry, Yumi.&quot; It was all Terry that could say. 

&quot;You don&#39;t have to apologize, Terry,&quot; She replied, &quot;If anything, I 
should be the one apologizing to you. I ruined the talks with Celaph 
when I ran out the way I did. I know that Colonel Beatrix will chew me 
out for it, but...&quot;

Terry crossed his arms. &quot;...She understands. Nobody wants to pressure 
you into anything, Yumi. I wouldn&#39;t allow that. You&#39;ve been through so 
much crap in your life in anyone&#39;s books. I don&#39;t want someone adding to 
it.&quot;

Yumi looked down from the Oriax and presented Terry a diminutive smile. 
&quot;You&#39;re such a sweet guy, Terry.&quot;

&quot;...Y-yeah, well,&quot; The normally headstrong male started blushing, 
&quot;...You&#39;re my friend, right? Friends have to look out for each other. 
Through the good times and through the bad.&quot;

The Japanese girl nodded. &quot;Yes. And if we see each other again, I&#39;ll 
repay the favour.&quot;

Suddenly the bright, bashful smile on Terry&#39;s face melted away into a 
frown. &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot;

Yumi turned her glance back to the Oriax and walked forward. She walked 
up to the left leg of that towering titan and pressed her palm into its 
cold and polished white metal. It was her vessel, her true friend. The 
one thing that Yumi would be with until the end of her life. 
&quot;Sometimes... when I&#39;m inside the cockpit of the Oriax... I can feel a 
voice speaking to me. It&#39;s a warm voice. One of protection and 
forgiveness. I think that it&#39;s the voice of the Oriax.&quot;

&quot;The voice of the Oriax?&quot; Terry repeated.  

&quot;Uh huh. These days I can hear it even when I&#39;m outside the cockpit. And 
I hear it now. The suit is telling me... that I have to confront my 
other half. I have to settle things with him.&quot;

Terry blinked. &quot;Your other half? You mean Freeman, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yumi closed her eyes, &quot;...In a way... I feel like... I 
understand him. He&#39;s very confused and unstable... but he&#39;s searching 
for his destiny. And I want to believe that I know what it is. Our 
confrontation. I know... it has to happen. I can&#39;t run from it.&quot;

&quot;Yumi, you don&#39;t owe that guy anything! Are you forgetting what he did 
to you?! Are you forgetting that he killed Edwina and her family?! Are 
you forgetting that he damn near wiped out Green Cloud?!&quot;

The hacker shook her head. &quot;No. I haven&#39;t forgotten. I&#39;m not making 
excuses for him, nor am I doing this in a bid to help him. This isn&#39;t 
about the pursuit of a vendetta or sating myself with revenge. This is 
my destiny. I can feel it. And I know deep in your heart that you feel 
it too.&quot;

&quot;It sounds to me like you&#39;re just looking for an excuse to die.&quot; Terry 
uttered. 

&quot;I don&#39;t plan on dying,&quot; Yumi&#39;s sky blue eyes opened again, &quot;but you 
know that I have to do this. I care about this ship and its crew. I&#39;ll 
miss it. But I can&#39;t stay here any longer than I already have.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re gonna go.&quot;

&quot;I have to.&quot;

Terry looked away. &quot;...Why?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m causing you pain by staying here. We both know it. At least this 
way it works out best for both of us. You have to concentrate on 
stopping the Divine Blade up in space. I have to finish things with 
Freeman. We both have roles to play... I just don&#39;t think they run on 
the same path anymore.&quot;

Terry sighed. This was not what he wanted to hear. Yumi was Yumi. His 
friend, his fellow pilot, and most of all the girl he cared for. He 
didn&#39;t want to let her go. But at the same time... Terry knew that he 
had no choice in the matter. Yumi Mishima was clearly important to the 
fate of the world. Standing in her way now would be selfish. And that 
was another thing he had been taught not to covet. The young man pulled 
the weakest smile of his life, un-crossed his arms, and tossed his 
ponytail over his shoulder. &quot;...If this is what you want then... I&#39;ll 
back you up on it. Go do what you have to.&quot;

Yumi turned around and walked up to Terry with a sad smile of her own. 
&quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;...Yumi... before you go... I have to tell you that...&quot;

The white-haired teen placed a finger on his lips. &quot;...Stop. Don&#39;t say 
it. It just makes things harder for both of us. I just want you to know 
that... had I never met Chizu... had I never been born with this 
power... had the circumstances been different in all ways possible, 
then... who knows. Maybe I could have felt the same.&quot;

Terry&#39;s head lulled. &quot;...I gotcha.&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t deserve someone like you, Terry,&quot; Yumi said, pressing her 
soft hand into his cheek, &quot;but I know there&#39;s someone out there who 
does. Goodbye.&quot;

Yumi Mishima then backed away from the Half-American, half-German pilot. 
And she stepped up to the tall metal ladder that led up to the platform 
from which she could enter the Oriax. Terry watched the younger girl 
climb up the steel bars of that ladder, until she reached the top of the 
platform. 

He quickly yelled, &quot;Will I ever see you again?!&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Yumi offered, once she came to the stomach of the Meta Suit the 
gateway into its dimensional cockpit opened up. She stepped inside and 
moved through that gate, shifting herself through time and space into 
the watery, spherical cockpit of the Oriax. Once she settled down on the 
seat, her hands went to the controls of her suit. And the image on 
screen showed her Terry, standing silently before the feet of the Oriax, 
&quot;...if such is the will of fate.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Once again the Triad of the Inquisition conversed in the large hall of 
darkness. The cold air bitter with the lingering words that pertained to 
mankind&#39;s fate. The three wise men stood together, in their normal, true 
selves, surrounding that circular window that acted as a means of 
observing what went on with regards to their affairs. The current image 
on that window which was fixed into the floor, was that of the Raum Meta 
Suit. It was standing cross-armed in a huge, expansive field of snow. It 
was probably Antarctica that Freeman had flown it to. And the Triad were 
more than aware of what he had planned. 

But they also had other... issues.

Aherg stared at the sight of the Raum. &quot;...He truly is worthless. He 
disobeyed orders and left his post. If he had more in the way of 
intelligence then he would know that he does our will, regardless of his 
insubordination.&quot;

&quot;This is good,&quot; Karahi suggested, &quot;now the ambiguous fate of the Eros 
can be delayed at our leisure. Their battle will cause the second 
evolution. The Oriax will become the Demiurge a full 8732 years ahead of 
schedule, but, it will guarantee a second Divine Hibernation. That will 
preserve her for the new era.&quot;

&quot;And Princess Ashura is secure. The defences of the Temple of 
Tlazolteotl have been mounted to their entirety. With the genetic 
modifications induced on her by Fahlem, she will preserve herself 
whether she undergoes Divine Hibernation now or later.&quot; Ein said.

&quot;Excellent,&quot; Aherg looked up from the window, &quot;then there is one last 
act to be fulfilled before we can prepare for the next stage. The Third 
Redemption, that which is the Last Massacre, must finally take place. 
Thus the executioner and his axe are at hand to perform the deed...&quot;

A cool, vivid chuckle rang out over the normally quiet hall of darkness. 
All three members of the Triad of the Inquisition turned to face the one 
who had produced that chuckle. Standing behind them was Rain. But in a 
very different form. His body had grown in age. From eighteen to 
twenty-two in development. His silvery hair had turned a darker shade. 
And his body was decked out in an all new form of dress. The torso of 
the youth was wrapped in a dark blue uniform that was added to by plates 
of steel armour, over his wrists, shins, chest and the lower half of his 
face. A long black cape flowed down from his back and spilled to the 
ground in its length. And his eyes, newly tinted with the colour of 
blood red, looked on his masters with a furious glare of servitude, 
bloodlust, and composure, all in one. This was not the same Rain Harland 
that Edwina Saffron had fallen in love with. This man had changed beyond 
recognition. He had become a whole new person. 

The Second of the Three Stars, &#39;De Anima&#39;. 

Aherg, Ein and Karahi stared at him from their positions around their 
window, though it was Ein who addressed him. &quot;...So you&#39;ve full control 
over your current Gnosis, eh? A true Ishtar has been born. Finally.&quot;

&quot;What is my name?&quot; Asked the new warrior.

Karahi spread his arms out. &quot;Thy name shall be Deathcatcher...&quot;

&quot;What is my mission?&quot;

&quot;To destroy,&quot; Aherg began sternly, &quot;all the world.&quot;
