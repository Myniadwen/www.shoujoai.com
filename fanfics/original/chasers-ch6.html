<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 6 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/chasers-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;So where to?&quot; Jen asked her as she leaned over in the driver&#39;s seat to 
program their course into the car&#39;s onboard computer. Her blue suit made 
her look like some kind of office lady, though most wouldn&#39;t look that 
stylish.

Kate sat in the passenger seat with her arms crossed, looking at the 
computer driven car with undisguised loathing. &quot;I don&#39;t like these 
automatic cars,&quot; she growled, tugging at the battered &#39;Pearl Jam&#39; 
T-shirt she wore.

&quot;Tough,&quot; Jen surprised her by answering. &quot;It&#39;s my turn to drive, so I 
get to pick the vehicle,&quot; she stated simply.

Kate gave her a glance that was almost respectful. &quot;Not bad, rookie,&quot; 
the brown hared woman said. She called up the initial report and read 
off the address, adding with a little smile, &quot;Something going on in 
uptown.&quot; A frown, &quot;Not much detail, though. Hostages again, maybe.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Jen programmed their route, and with a soft hum the car 
smoothly started off. &quot;So why do you dislike me so much?&quot; she asked Kate 
bluntly.

Kate looked clearly startled, &quot;What? I don&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Well, being surly and snarly isn&#39;t a true sign of friendship where I 
come from,&quot; Jen crisply answered her. The tall blonde pushed her hair 
back, suddenly looking nervous as she quietly asked, &quot;Have I done 
something to offend you?&quot;

Kate looked at the young woman, then looked away with a sigh. &quot;It&#39;s 
nothing personal, Jen,&quot; she answered. &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re a nice kid,&quot; she 
looked out the window, &quot;but I don&#39;t want a partner who&#39;s also a friend 
right now.&quot;

Jen opened her mouth to say something, then she closed it. There really 
wasn&#39;t much she could say in answer to that. &quot;All right,&quot; she 
acknowledged with a sigh.

The car glided along roadways, eventually reaching a lift. They slid 
inside, and rose to the top of the building, then out on a roadway 
again. They cruised along for a while, then entered yet another lift to 
rise even higher.

To break the silence Kate said, &quot;The air up here&#39;s almost clear. I 
wonder how many billions of yen a year you need to make to live here?&quot;

&quot;More than either of us will,&quot; Jen smiled. They slid from the lift out 
onto a sunlit street, and she was tempted to slow down to enjoy it. But 
they were here on business, and innocent lives might be in jeopardy.

They pulled up in front of the block on the report, and noticed several 
squad cars parked around it. Police officers waited against their 
vehicles, their casual air bothering Kate. &quot;What the hell?&quot; she 
whispered softly to Jen.

Jen shrugged eloquently even as they coasted to a stop. &quot;Let&#39;s find 
out,&quot; Jen said as she popped the hatches and they both climbed out.

Kate strode over to where the officer in charge stood, &quot;What&#39;s the 
situation?&quot;

The man looked awfully nervous. He flipped though his papers a moment, 
cleared his throat, &quot;Hostage taking. There&#39;s only one android involved, 
a housekeeper.&quot;

&quot;So who&#39;s the hostage?&quot; Jen asked.

The officer hesitated, then a woman&#39;s voice cried out, &quot;Thank god you&#39;re 
here!&quot; They looked up to see a obviously wealthy redhead run over, her 
face pinched with strain. &quot;You&#39;ve got to rescue my Poochie,&quot; she wailed.

&quot;Poochie?&quot; Kate echoed, an odd look on her face.

&quot;That horrible android has my dog,&quot; the redhead said tearfully.

Jen looked sideways at Kate. The older woman&#39;s eyebrow was twitching 
madly, and the veins on the side of her head throbbed. &quot;We&#39;ll do our 
best, ma&#39;am,&quot; Jen reassured her. She looked over at the officer, &quot;Where 
is it?&quot;

She noted the information down quickly, and before Kate could say or do 
anything too career damaging, Jen grabbed her by the arm and nearly 
dragged her inside. The door shut behind them, and Kate exploded.

&quot;A dog?!&quot; Kate growled, waving her arms around wildly. &quot;They called us 
out here to rescue a dog?&quot; she repeated indignantly.

&quot;I suppose we could always complain to Gwen about it later,&quot; Jen sighed.

Kate surprised her by snickering. &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll get a good laugh out 
of it,&quot; she said. She took a few deep breaths, managing to get her 
temper back under control again. &quot;All right,&quot; she sighed, &quot;let&#39;s go 
rescue the damn dog.&quot;

They went down the hallway silently, then up to the suite&#39;s second 
level. They neared the back room where they had been told Poochie was. 
They heard the playful yips of a small puppy, and Jen looked 
questioningly at Kate. She shrugged in reply, and they cautiously looked 
around the corner into the room.

The android, a dark hared model dressed up in a maid&#39;s outfit, was 
sitting on the floor as the puppy ran around her, yipping madly. She 
smiled down at the dog fondly, reaching out to gently ruffle it&#39;s fur. 
The dog yowled happily, wiggling under the caress.

The android noticed them, and smiled sadly. &quot;I guess you&#39;re here to take 
him back,&quot; she said, picking up the wriggling puppy. She gently held the 
dog close, &quot;She over feeds him, you know. Never exercises him, or spends 
much time with him.&quot; She sighed, &quot;Poochie is just a status symbol, the 
prestige of having enough money to be able to afford a pet.&quot;

She got up and walked towards them, the puppy still in her arms, Jen 
noticed Kate draw her pistol, but the android surprised her by simply 
putting the puppy in Jen&#39;s hands. She turned to Kate and extended her 
arms, the classic position for receiving handcuffs.

&quot;Uhm, Thanks,&quot; Kate said as she secured the android&#39;s wrists, just a bit 
thrown off by her peaceful surrender.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; the android responded serenely.

As soon as they were out the door the redhead ran forward, tearfully 
pulling the puppy from Jen&#39;s hands. It yelped happily, licking the tears 
from her face and she laughed, holding it close. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she cried, 
kissing Jen on the cheek. She turned to do the same to Kate, saw the 
look on her face, and decided not to.

The android looked kind of startled at that display of emotion. As Kate 
and Jen began to lead her away, the puppy began to cry piteously.

The redhead looked at the puppy, then over at the android. &quot;Wait a 
moment,&quot; she said, walking over to the police officers. The puppy 
quieted down as soon as it got near her. &quot;You were taking care of him, 
weren&#39;t you?&quot; the redhead asked the android.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the android answered her simply. &quot;You were feeding him too 
much, and he wasn&#39;t getting enough exercise. He would get sick soon, if 
I didn&#39;t do something,&quot; she explained.

&quot;Just like I told you to,&quot; the redhead said thoughtfully. She looked at 
the puppy, then over at the android. &quot;What happens,&quot; she said quietly, 
&quot;if I don&#39;t choose to press charges?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Kate said, surprised.

&quot;I guess,&quot; Jen said with a little smile, &quot;we&#39;d probably have to let her 
go.&quot; Kate kept her mouth shut, but the muscles of her jaw tensed.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to have inconvenienced you,&quot; the redhead smiled at them, &quot;but 
I&#39;m not pressing charges.&quot; Without saying a word Kate reached over to 
unlock the cuffs and then stalked back to the car, clearly displeased.

Jen watched the android and the redhead walk off, hearing them talking 
quietly.

&quot;Next time, just tell me,&quot; the redhead told the maid, reaching over to 
gently take her arm.

&quot;I&#39;ll try, ma&#39;am,&quot; the android answered, both of them walking close 
together.

Jen raised her eyebrows. She walked away, and joined Kate in the car. 
&quot;That was cute,&quot; she smiled, &quot;and did you see the two of them together? 
Made me wonder...&quot;

Kate groaned, before glaring at Jen. &quot;If you don&#39;t stop being so perky,&quot; 
she said dangerously, &quot;I&#39;m going to have to get violent.&quot;

Jen just grinned back at her.



Beth looked at the initial report, and began to laugh.

&quot;What?&quot; Gwen asked, coming into the computer room.

Beth handed the hand screen over, &quot;Read this.&quot;

&quot;Poochie?&quot; Gwen raised her eyebrows, and gave a throaty laugh. &quot;I wonder 
how Kate took that,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;Badly!&quot; both young woman said together.

&quot;Are you going off shift?&quot; Gwen asked her, noticing that Beth had a 
jacket on over her usual x-rated outfit. This time, the little redhead 
was wearing short-shorts that left little to the imagination, with a 
spandex top.

&quot;Just as soon as my relief arrives,&quot; Beth smiled, and noticed a young 
woman coming in to the room. &quot;Speak of the devil,&quot; she laughed, getting 
up out of her seat with a bounce. &quot;Hey, Julie,&quot; she smiled at the dark 
hared girl.

&quot;Hi, Beth,&quot; Julie smiled, giving her a hug. More quietly, &quot;So when are 
we going out together again?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take you home with me anytime,&quot; Beth laughed at she hurried out.

Julie went beet red, and Gwen had to fight the urge to laugh.
