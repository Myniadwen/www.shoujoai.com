<h1>All Girls School (part 44 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch43.html">Back to Part 43</a><pre>Rai Zanders woke up with no energy. It was nearly 7:30, time to get up, 
but she felt like she could pull a Rip van Winkle and sleep for years. 
She groaned, slumped down, and weakly pulled back the sheets covering 
her body. She was naked underneath, save for the young woman folded 
around her. It was well into October, but their combined heat made her 
swelter. She groaned and rubbed her face. Last night had not been her 
best moment.

Ana Lu woke up with far too much energy. She breathed in life, sighed, 
and cuddled closer to Rai. With a soft &quot;Morning, honey&quot;, she crawled up 
and kissed Rai&#39;s shoulder and neck. Her hands rubbed naked skin 
contently, and no words came from her, except a wistful &quot;I&#39;m happy&quot;. Rai 
shoved her away, managed to flop out of bed, and lumbered to her 
bathroom.

&quot;Where ya goin&#39;, honey?&quot; whispered Ana.

&quot;Shower.&quot;

&quot;Can I come?&quot; Rai just grumbled. As Ana pushed herself from the empty 
bed, the alarm finally went off as 7:30 rolled around.

Well I can&#39;t regret,

can&#39;t you just forget it?

I started something I couldn&#39;t finish

And if we go down,

we go down together

best friends means,

well best friends means

And I&#39;ve got a twenty-dollar bill

that says you&#39;re up late night starting

fist fights versus fences in your backyard

Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor

Soaking in sympathy

from friends who never loved you

nearly half as much as me

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable...ohoh

Well I can&#39;t regret,

can&#39;t you just forget it?

I started something I couldn&#39;t finish

If we go down,

we go down together

best friends means,

well best friends means

You never knew

well I never told you...

Everything I know about breaking hearts

I learned from you, it&#39;s true

I&#39;ve never done it with the style and grace you have

But I&#39;ve made long term plans

based on these mistakes

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable

Is this what you call tact?

I swear you&#39;re as subtle as a brick in the small of my back

so let&#39;s end this call,

and end this conversation

there&#39;s nothing worse...

(that&#39;s right he said, that&#39;s right he said it)

I swear, you have no idea

The jealousy that became me thinking

(that&#39;s right he said)

that you always had it way too easy

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friend thinks I pulled the trigger!

Best friend thinks you get what you deserve!

&quot;Conflict&quot;

Rai drove Ana and herself to school in humiliation. Of all the things 
she had done! She never thought it would ever go so far, or be so quiet, 
or pass so suddenly. She had slept with Ana&#151;no, not slept; they had 
shared a bed before. They had engaged in sex, rather, something she 
believed would never happen. But now... the lingering grit, smell, and 
feel was still on her, despite the shower she had taken&#151;the shower she 
had taken with Ana. Her eyes squinted, she turned a corner, and stopped. 
She could see Ana smiling quietly from the corner of her eye.

&quot;Guess this makes us lovers, huh?&quot; she said at last. Rai didn&#39;t reply. 
&quot;Huh? Rai-chan? Sweetest lady? Pretty blunette?&quot; Ana kissed her cheek 
and toyed with her dyed-dark blue hair, and Rai swatted her away.

&quot;I don&#39;t feel well,&quot; she grumbled. Ana cooed.

&quot;Aww... whassa mattah? You gotta sniffle? Well you just let Nurse Ana 
take care of you, sweetie.&quot; Zanders rolled her eyes.

&quot;Spare me.&quot; The light turned green.

&quot;Hey...&quot; Rai left Ana in the car. The poor blonde was used to being 
escorted out, so she was amazed to find herself left behind. Irritably, 
she jerked herself out, locked and shut the door, and jogged after her 
love. &quot;Rai... Rai! Is something wrong? You know, you really do look 
sick. I&#39;ll take care of you if you need me to.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t... Ana.&quot;

&quot;What, what?&quot; Lu hugged her arm and got shoved off. She slapped Rai&#39;s 
shoulder and continued to pester her, &quot;What-what-what-what-what? What, 
Rai?&quot;

&quot;Stop it.&quot;

&quot;Stop what?&quot; She kissed the shoulder. &quot;Am I bothering you?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Get to class.&quot; Ana frowned.

&quot;You in a bad mood?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh.&quot;

&quot;Is it cuz&#39; I wasn&#39;t very good in bed last night? It was my first time, 
Rai.&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t believe you,&quot; she murmured. Now this got Ana mad.

&quot;What? Are you saying I&#39;m a whore?!&quot; Rai stopped walking and turned to 
face her.

&quot;I realize you&#39;re inexperienced,&quot; she said stoically, &quot;so it&#39;s not that. 
I believe that was your first time. But I just don&#39;t... believe you.&quot; 
Ana was silent for awhile as she stared at her love.

&quot;When it comes to...... what?&quot; she asked. Rai half-shrugged.

&quot;A lot of things. Almost everything. Get to class, Ana.&quot;

&quot;Uh-uh, no way. If you need to say something&#151;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see you in history, I guess.&quot; Rai walked off, leaving Ana to 
fester in anger.

&quot;Rai! Come back&#151;hey! Don&#39;t leave me! Rai! You&#39;re being very rude.&quot;

&quot;Go away.&quot; Ana froze in her tracks&#151;her heart froze in its cage of 
bone&#151;and she stared in horror. Go away. Rai had told her to go away 
before, many times, but never in that tone of voice. Go away, Ana, I&#39;m 
busy. Ana, go away, I&#39;m in the bathroom, I&#39;m in the shower. Get away, 
Ana, I&#39;m in a bad mood and I don&#39;t want to let it out on you. Get away, 
silly. Ana, get away from there, you know better. Ana, let&#39;s go away 
somewhere quiet. Go away, I&#39;m eating. Go away.

Ana Lu whispered to herself quietly as she watched her love vanish in 
the sea of people.

&quot;Rai... was it something I did?&quot;

............

Hero Love sighed. Just when her life was becoming sweet, it had to turn 
so complicated! She believed Ayanna was all worth it, but... why so much 
trouble? Why now? Was having a girlfriend such a bother? Why all this 
conflict with Ayanna, and not with Brandy, her best friend and first 
girlfriend? Was it because Ayanna was new in her life? Because she was 
black? Because she didn&#39;t attend church three times a week? Because... 
why? Even Hero didn&#39;t understand, and she had tried to look at things 
from every point of view.

Dinner

&quot;We&#39;ve been seeing a lot of you, Ayanna. You must&#39;ve taken quite a shine 
to Hero.&quot;

&quot;Uh... you could say that, Mrs. Love.&quot; The older woman smiled.

&quot;I can&#39;t blame you, she&#39;s a sweetheart. You two seem to spend quite a 
bit of time together, more than most friends would. Hero, are you making 
Ayanna another best friend of yours?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no mom,&quot; she answered, &quot;uh... about that. I&#39;ve been meaning to tell 
you.&quot; Hero cleared her throat, laid down her fork, and took a deep 
breath. &quot;Ayanna is my girlfriend, mom. We&#39;re dating.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; If Mrs. Love was surprised, she didn&#39;t show it. Her husband 
actually looked happy.

&quot;It&#39;s good that you&#39;ve found someone again, Tracey. I was beginning to 
think you turned into a nun after parting ways with Jon. So you&#39;re her 
girlfriend...&quot; He studied Ayanna casually, not appearing mad or upset, 
as Johnson would&#39;ve expected. She gave Hero an inquisitive look.

&quot;Um, this is a bit off topic, but why&#39;d you call her Tracey, sir?&quot;

&quot;Short for Teresa,&quot; he said. Hero picked up the slack.

&quot;Hero Teresa Minerva Love. It&#39;s my full name. My parents have an odd 
sense of humor.&quot; Ayanna blanched somewhat.

&quot;Hero Teresa... so it spells HTML?&quot;

&quot;Computer joke,&quot; muttered her father playfully. Hero rolled her eyes, 
and Ayanna said &quot;Oh.&quot;

Then she said, &quot;But anyway, you&#39;re not upset that Hero and I are 
dating?&quot;

&quot;Mm, not really. We&#39;re okay with her being bisexual, and she&#39;s dated a 
girl before, although the last one was her best friend Brandy.&quot;

&quot;I know. But it&#39;s a little weird&#151;&quot;

&quot;That we&#39;re okay with Hero being half-gay?&quot; said her mother. Hero 
snorted.

&quot;It&#39;s not half-gay, mom. I&#39;m just bisexual.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re okay with it anyway,&quot; resumed Mrs. Love. &quot;As long as she&#39;s happy 
and doing good, we don&#39;t care. Besides, she&#39;s proven that she has good 
judgment, in spite of her ability to make very rash decisions.&quot;

&quot;Mother!&quot; Mrs. Love laughed politely.

&quot;Don&#39;t get so annoyed over the truth, dear. So tell us how you two came 
to be. I know you met in gym class and knew each other for awhile, but 
how&#39;d you start actually dating?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a weird story, ma&#39;am,&quot; admitted Ayanna quietly. &quot;I was first 
dating this girl named Gabrielle, who was also in gym class. She was my 
cousin Olivia&#39;s best friend, or one of them. Anyway, I sort of broke it 
off with her since it really wasn&#39;t what I was looking for&#151;I hear she&#39;s 
got a new girlfriend now anyway.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;By that time,&quot; added Hero, &quot;we sort of became friends, so we had a 
little talk and decided to go out one evening and... y&#39;know, celebrate 
our new bachelorette status.&quot;

&quot;Did you go to that club again?&quot; asked Hero&#39;s father sharply. Hero made 
a face, which was admittance enough. &quot;Tracey, we&#39;ve warned you about 
going there, especially on school nights. You know those places can be 
very dangerous.&quot;

&quot;I know, dad.&quot;

&quot;Drugs and... gangs and... alcohol and... kids looking to pick 
fights...&quot;

&quot;Dad,&quot; she said impatiently, &quot;half that stuff&#39;s not even there, you&#39;re 
just exaggerating. Anyway, I know that place well, so I can take care of 
myself.&quot;

&quot;All the same,&quot; he muttered, drinking his evening coffee, &quot;I think you 
should find someplace else to spend your evenings. There&#39;s nothing wrong 
with a few nights at home.&quot;

&quot;I spend a few nights at home, dad.&quot;

&quot;I think your father has the right idea,&quot; said her mother quietly. &quot;You 
should definitely find somewhere nicer. Your father and I never went to 
any of those places, and we still had fun.&quot;

&quot;Mom.&quot;

&quot;Hero, it&#39;s no big deal,&quot; murmured Ayanna carelessly. &quot;Those places 
aren&#39;t my style either. I mean, once in awhile, sure, but... any other 
place would be fine.&quot; Hero grimaced again, and picked at her food for a 
few seconds, until an idea came to her.

&quot;How about this? What if I only go with Ayanna, and only when she 
wants?&quot;

&quot;Then it&#39;s really up to her,&quot; said Mr. Love, &quot;and as she said...&quot;

&quot;Well, if it&#39;s once in awhile, I don&#39;t see the harm.&quot; Father smiled at 
mother and agreed, and allowed their eldest daughter that much room at 
least. She thanked them and resumed her story.

&quot;So anyway, Ayanna and I went to that club. We kinda got into the music 
and met some friends of ours there as well. Zane from gym, she&#39;s the 
soccer captain, she went off with Ayanna&#39;s cousin, and I think I saw 
Katt and X there as well. So anyway, Ayanna and I were by ourselves, 
having fun.&quot;

&quot;Sounds nice,&quot; said her mother. &quot;Then what?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s...&quot; Hero and Ayanna shared meek smiles, and became flush. 
&quot;...Kinda personal after that.&quot;

&quot;Mm, don&#39;t be shy. You know you can say anything in front of the family, 
Tracey.&quot;

&quot;But not my brothers and sister.&quot; Her parents looked at their other 
children, who had eaten very quietly throughout the entire meal (their 
dates, if they had any, were not present). They looked back.

&quot;Maybe we should spare ourselves Tracey&#39;s exploits this one time,&quot; said 
their eldest son. They all agreed and excused themselves, leaving just 
Hero, her girlfriend, and her parents. Mr. Love cracked his knuckles and 
smiled broadly.

&quot;Well then, that&#39;s taken care of. Still feel awkward?&quot;

&quot;A little,&quot; admitted their daughter meekly. She coughed, but Ayanna 
covered for her cold turkey.

&quot;We kinda made out, Mr. Love.&quot;

&quot;And that means...?&quot;

&quot;We kissed a lot, dad.&quot; He blinked.

&quot;Just like that?&quot;

&quot;I guess. It sorta happened. But we both liked it.&quot; Hero grinned, as did 
Ayanna, and both her parents turned a little flush.

&quot;Well... now we know,&quot; said her mother.

Present

Her mother and father had been cool with it, as she expected, but some 
people&#151;mainly, a few from her church&#151;were not. Hero had feared the 
repercussions of secretly towing a girlfriend around that place, and 
while a few good souls lived and let live, others thumped around, poked 
their noses, and otherwise got goats and stirred dust. The whole thing 
might&#39;ve been laced with irony if Hero hadn&#39;t seen it coming. Ayanna, 
for her part, was supportive and cooperative, and especially patient.

Sunday

Few people really stared at them, as there were many people there and it 
was not easy to pick two out of the crowd, in spite of Hero&#39;s choice of 
dress (she came with her raver clothes, but could not glean shock from 
anybody). Ayanna had worn a pink sweater and jeans, so they hardly 
attracted attention&#151;at least for awhile. Hero kept her hand locked with 
her girlfriend&#39;s anxiously, hoping her faith in humanity&#39;s goodness 
overcame her dread of its insidious nature.

The preacher, or rather the speaker (&quot;religious&quot; terms like that were 
used sparingly at the church), spoke about how similar humans are to 
sheep: how easily they stray, how foolish they can become, how God often 
must call them sharply or punish them for wandering away. He cited a 
parable about lost sheep, and even told a story about a young shepherd 
looking for one he had lost. The message had truth to it, so it was 
offensive, but Hero was glad for it, although she couldn&#39;t help but 
think how it foreshadowed events. Humans are foolish sheep. Their 
bleating can sometimes be louder than the shepherd&#39;s gentle call.

The youth program service, simply called One, was fairly gentle to the 
couple. The high school minister spoke to Ayanna for awhile, and Hero, 
and many others, and made no assumption other than fact. Love&#39;s friends 
greeted her and drew no conclusions. She didn&#39;t flaunt her girlfriend 
around like a jewel, but neither did she hide her like a scar (the false 
piercings and tattoos she bore were evidence enough that Love was not 
accustomed to hiding things). They had ran into good fortune, but it was 
only a matter of time before...

&quot;Young lady.&quot; Hero turned, parted her dyed-blonde hair, and smiled.

&quot;Yo, afternoon there.&quot;

&quot;Are you two together here?&quot; he asked, pointing to them both.

&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;

&quot;As in... friends?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s a concern.&quot;

&quot;You do know what the Bible says about homosexuals, don&#39;t you?&quot; Hero 
rolled her eyes.

&quot;God, I can&#39;t believe we&#39;re having this conversation...&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;s that? Does it make you uncomfortable?&quot;

&quot;Very,&quot; she answered frankly. She gave Ayanna a &quot;let&#39;s go&quot; look and took 
her elsewhere. The man persisted, though.

&quot;You should end that relationship, young lady, as quickly as possible. 
Otherwise you&#39;re knowingly committing a sin.&quot; Hero snorted.

&quot;Didn&#39;t Our Father who art in Heaven say something about whoever was 
free of sin could cast stones?&quot;

&quot;He also asks obedience to His word.&quot;

&quot;He also asks we love others, and I&#39;ve no shame in saying I love this 
woman.&quot;

&quot;But as a sister in Christ, or&#151;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a sister in Christ,&quot; interrupted Ayanna, taking Hero&#39;s hand. 
She stared down the taller man and added sharply, &quot;I stopped believing 
when people like you came about, thinking you knew all the answers, 
thinking you were better, thinking one sin was more unforgivable than 
another. Get a life, bozo.&quot; She walked away with her girlfriend, 
ignoring the man&#39;s reply. When they were alone, she sighed and covered 
her face. Hero embraced her.

&quot;Hey. It&#39;s all right. You did really great back there.&quot; Ayanna revealed 
herself after a few seconds and smiled. She caressed Hero&#39;s face, and 
kissed her.

&quot;People like you reaffirm my faith in people, and in God. If only the 
world were half as great as you.&quot;

&quot;Mm, I&#39;m not really great, I just try doing great.&quot;

&quot;What humility.&quot; Ayanna beamed and gave her girlfriend a long, loving 
kiss. Hero sighed and rested her head on her fuzzy pink shoulder.

&quot;They&#39;re not all like him, Ayanna. Of course, some are even worse, but 
most people here are smarter than that. We&#39;re each wallowing in sin; 
he&#39;s done things just as bad, not nearly as bad, and worse than us. He&#39;s 
no right to judge us or to say how right he is.&quot; Ayanna did not answer. 
She held her girlfriend a little while longer, and kissed her ear.

&quot;You hungry?&quot;

&quot;...Starved. Soon all these extra pounds will wither away.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;There anyplace to eat around here?&quot; Hero took a breath and pointed far 
off into the distance.

&quot;Over there&#39;s an atrium. The food&#39;s usually very good, but I wouldn&#39;t 
touch the pizza. Get the catfish sticks, trust me.&quot; Ayanna promised she 
would, and took Hero&#39;s hand as they walked over. They did not encounter 
any hecklers, not even the man&#151;but over time, Hero&#39;s situation weighed 
upon her. Christian. Bisexual. Lover of God. Lover of Ayanna. God abhors 
homosexuality. God loves all. Hate sin. Love people. If ever she felt 
pulled in two different directions, it was now that time...

............

Rai ignored Ana in history class, and in art, she sat with somebody 
else. Ana had noticed the change in her girlfriend and figured it was 
just moodiness or a desirability to be left alone, to have space, to 
think. Rai didn&#39;t seem like she was in a very bad mood, because she was 
smiling with Furious Hail, who had no companion that hour (Corona was 
home sick). Ana blew air from her mouth in annoyance, and worked solo 
until somebody came over and joined her.

&quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;Uh... actually, no.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Eh... no reason. Just not feeling 100.&quot;

Denial was by far one of the best ways to cope with weakness.

Ana knew she&#39;d have to bum a ride off Rai, unless she wanted to take the 
bus. She gambled on Zanders&#39; generosity and waited for her by her car. 
She gave a wide grin and waved her blue-haired partner over, but was 
sadly ignored. As Rai unlocked her vehicle, she finally took notice of 
the blonde, sighed, and parted her sapphire hair. Ana personally loved 
it when she did that, but she looked so serious.

&quot;If you want me to take you home, Ana, I don&#39;t mind, but this will be 
the last time.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; she asked innocently.

&quot;Because I don&#39;t think we should see each other again.&quot;

&quot;Well we kinda share classes&#151;&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean.&quot; Ana&#39;s pep began to drain. Her face drooped. 
She began to realize why Rai was treating her like this. Zanders didn&#39;t 
give her much time to think as she opened the car door and told her to 
get in. She did not turn on her radio.

&quot;Let&#39;s talk,&quot; she said on the way to Lu&#39;s home. &quot;About earlier... when I 
said I didn&#39;t believe you. It&#39;s not about the sex; it&#39;s about... a lot 
of things.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; said Ana seriously. Rai swallowed.

&quot;First, I don&#39;t believe you when you say you&#39;re attracted to women. I 
cite our first encounter. Second, I don&#39;t believe you when you say I&#39;m 
your girlfriend, and I don&#39;t like you clinging to me like a lovesick 
barnacle. I&#39;m going through some troubled times here, and your 
attachment isn&#39;t helping me.&quot;

&quot;What do you&#151;&quot;

&quot;Third,&quot; she continued, &quot;I don&#39;t believe you when you say you love me.&quot;

&quot;But I&#151;&quot;

&quot;Fourth,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I can&#39;t believe we actually had sex. We did, I 
know, but... I sort of regret doing it. Even if I did like you...&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Ana quietly. Rai took a deep breath.

&quot;I never considered you my girlfriend, Ana. From time to time I liked 
you, and enjoyed your company, but overall... you were an annoyance, a 
hindrance. You&#39;re just not like me at all. You make me ask myself too 
many questions. Some days, I even hoped I wouldn&#39;t run into you. Others, 
yes, I couldn&#39;t wait to see you, but for the most part, Ana... We should 
not see each other again. I don&#39;t like you like that. I barely like you 
at all.&quot;

Rai then hardened her heart as Ana began to cry. They said nothing else 
the whole trip, except when they arrived at Lu&#39;s home. Rai said &quot;Get 
out, please,&quot; very quietly, and drove home in solitude. She couldn&#39;t 
help but relax as she felt a great weight lift from her back.

But if I&#39;m so relieved, then why does a part of me feel bad?

For her part, Mrs. Lu could do nothing to comfort her daughter&#39;s grief.

Her father only offered her food and an ear, and a hand to hold.

.........

A single figure, traveling in secrecy, shrouded by a coat and by her own 
doubts, made her way to the church. Could absolution save her? Could she 
repent of something she believed in? Could one love overcome another, 
even though she wanted both? Would she be forgiven&#151;or would she be 
forgiven because she sought forgiveness? Was her remorse a kind of sin 
as well? Was her pride? Her love? Could love ever be wrong? Could she 
forsake love for beliefs? Too many questions. Maybe she sought answers, 
not forgiveness. Regardless, she entered the room quietly, traveled down 
the sanctuary, and came to the booth. She drew a breath, perhaps to 
cleanse herself.

&quot;Father forgive me, for I have sinned. At least I think I have.&quot;</pre>
