The Lost were feeling more like themselves than before: they truly felt 
lost. After the sudden disappearance of Kagemusha, the emergence of 
twelve others who on occasion came and went (consorting with the eerie 
Mr. White), and the rather distressing rise in turmoil in the outside 
world, everybody had been on edge. There was also terrible cabin fever 
to consider, and fights broke out nearly every day, even amongst 
friends. Something dreadful was on the horizon, everybody could feel 
it&#151;but what it was and when it would come remained a mystery.

But not for long. Many days passed since Merry&#39;s first dip into a 
romantic life. The afterglow was wearing off and she began to miss 
G-Force. Marissa had that Sanaa character on the mind, and Lurker, whose 
charm was starting to wear thin, was soon becoming more trouble than she 
was worth. Venom was growing close to Technomancer, but the older woman 
kept herself isolated and shut off from everybody, much like Kagemusha 
before her. The Disintegrator remained unchanged&#151;immature, dangerous, 
and unpredictable&#151;but was beginning to wonder, in her own way, just what 
she could get away with while the &quot;boss&quot; was gone.

They could go outside, but the six Lost girls wanted more; they wanted 
to truly get out, leave the compound, seek their ally (or, if the 
mysterious Pale had a mind to join them, allies), and do some good in 
the world (except Shalis the Technomancer, who actually loved being 
cooped up). It was like having an itch while their hands were tied, and 
if things didn&#39;t start to turn around for them, one or another would 
have a mental breakdown and flee, or worse. The real question was Whom, 
and When.

On one of the more dreary days, Venom was passing by Shalis&#39; workspace, 
knowing every area of the compound by heart. Shalis was taking a shower, 
and had left her computer in the care of a mighty protection system, the 
likes of which only she could handle. It was displaying information 
quickly, processing all by itself in the absence of its caretaker, and 
Venom&#151;now called Namie very commonly by everybody&#151;couldn&#39;t help but take 
a closer look and see what the older woman was working on. Apparently 
she had built in a new radar system that tracked foreign life forms, and 
it clicked every so often on the screen.

Meaning they had visitors. Namie became uneasy. Lurker had been the last 
new person to enter into the compound, not counting those others that 
came and went, so she became suspicious. Who would even know where they 
were, and why would they visit? A misguided wanderer was too unlikely, 
seeing as how utterly isolated the compound was (but it was not 
impossible). According to the new radar, though, there were at least 
seven of these visitors, and they were coming closer. They knew where to 
look, Namie thought with a chill. Were they friends or...

A violent shudder swept her from her feet as the world around her 
trembled. A second eruption sent her rolling, and a third nearly broke 
her leg. She managed to stand, only slightly amused that her body had 
not burnt the floor away, and ran to see if everyone else was okay. 
Before she left the small room, Shalis&#39; computer activated the alarm 
system, which had never been needed until now. It was designed to warn 
the Lost of invaders.

The six girls had all been doing something tedious when the explosions 
hit, and were all thrust to the ground, even Alisti, who swore violently 
and demanded to be put back up. Only Julie, the Lurker, found her 
footing the easiest, and scampered about on all fours, heeding the call 
of her friend. She lifted Kreager back into her chair, asked the girl if 
she was okay (getting a foul response), and helped wheel her to safety, 
or what could pass as it. Julie wanted to find the others, and to see 
what was going on, but it was a slow process, as Alisti could not be 
jostled around very much.

CAREFUL! she would screech if she was so much as wiggled.

&quot;Trying hard. The world is angry, or frightened.&quot;

EXPLOSIONS.

&quot;What, what? What could blast and blaze like that? And where does it 
come from?&quot;

OUTSIDE.

&quot;What, what!&quot; she screamed, letting go of Alisti&#39;s chair. Disintegrator 
yelled for Julie to come back as she ran off, but there was no stopping 
her once she was berserk. Everyone had been itching for a fight for too 
long, and now that one was right at their door, they would not pass the 
opportunity by. Lurker was soon joined by Rancor and Marissa, and Venom 
came in later, desperately trying to keep her balance as the compound 
shuddered. Flames erupted, and the building stared to cave. The girls 
screamed and Merry willed her skin to thicken as she stood like a 
pillar, protecting her friends. Just in time, too&#151;the ceiling looked 
ready to collapse.

&quot;We have to get outside!&quot; shouted Namie. &quot;Marissa, gather everyone here 
where it&#39;s safe. I&#39;ll go get Shalis.&quot;

&quot;Where are Julie and Alisti?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, but if they&#39;re here, you&#39;ll find them! Hurry! Merry, how 
much longer can you hold out?&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she said, obviously overwhelmed, &quot;as long as I need. Don&#39;t worry 
about me being smashed. I&#39;ll keep this place from falling apart.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; The two dispersed, but Merry had other problems. As the 
ceiling completely fell down, into her awaiting hands, she soon became 
caught, and not a good time for it. She was the first to see the 
invaders, all seven of them, and glared though she could do nothing. She 
recognized the one called Pride from the Arena, but the others...

&quot;Let me guess,&quot; she managed. &quot;The Seven Deadly Sins?&quot;

&quot;Right you are,&quot; said Avarice, nodding politely. He then directed the 
others: &quot;I will go see what funds this place has. Don&#39;t let it crumble 
until then. Wrath, Pride, Envy, I encourage you to continue what you&#39;re 
doing and weaken this place. If there are more like her, get rid of 
them.&quot;

&quot;What about her?&quot; asked Lust. &quot;She looks divine.&quot;

&quot;Oh, who cares? Do whatever you like. It doesn&#39;t look like Gluttony 
could stomach her&#151;&quot; The fat man who was obviously Gluttony barked at 
this terrible pun, but seeing as how he was forbidden to fight one of 
his own, he simply stomped off looking for scraps. Merry scowled like a 
cornered dog, and wondered if she could let the ceiling fall and flatten 
everyone in there. But no, if that part of the compound was lost, then 
the whole building would soon collapse, and everyone would die&#151;except 
for her, of course, what with her thick skin. She could not bear to do 
such an evil act.

But she soon wouldn&#39;t have a choice. Avarice was giving her a malicious 
look, and smiled. &quot;On second thought,&quot; he drawled. &quot;Sloth, my good man. 
Please keep this woman company. We&#39;ll do whatever we like from here on 
out.&quot; An older man in a wheelchair, willowy and lazy, rolled over to her 
with a sleepy smile, and stared. Rancor immediately buckled as he came 
to a stop, and suddenly felt an overwhelming desire to let do, drop to 
the floor, and sleep, sleep forever. It was all she could do just to 
stand and keep a hold on what little life she had left.

Marissa found Alisti, not in very good shape, and got her to calm down 
just enough so she wasn&#39;t raving anymore. She told the girl what was 
happening and volunteered to wheel her to safety. Of course there was 
protesting&#151;Alisti wanted to zap the invaders with her ghastly power&#151;but 
Marissa knew that any stray blasts of disintegration would cause even 
more destruction. And besides, Alisti usually blacked out after a few 
powerful volts, and would be easily slain by survivors.

The two got to near one of the back doors before they were stopped. 
Standing before them were two distractingly gorgeous women, though one 
looked considerably more confident of herself than the other. The second 
clearly envied the first, for she stole glances even as they spoke: 
&quot;Well, what do we have here? Two stray hens from the flock. What are you 
running away from?&quot;

&quot;You, most likely,&quot; answered Wainright. Alisti merely glared.

&quot;Oh, but we&#39;re not going to harm you. We actually want to help.&quot;

&quot;You...do?&quot;

FOCUS! Marissa snapped out of her trance&#151;Alisti&#39;s loud telekinetic 
blasts certainly came in handy&#151;and she was herself again. She glared 
just to be sure.

&quot;Out of our way!&quot;

&quot;You there,&quot; said Envy, the second woman, to Alisti. &quot;Aren&#39;t you always 
jealous of others? The way they&#39;re always prettier than you, how they 
can walk around freely and use their bodies? How people don&#39;t stare at 
them, how they&#39;re able to so easily blend in? Don&#39;t you hate being a 
freak? Wouldn&#39;t you give anything to be just a normal little girl?&quot;

SHUT...UP...managed the girl, but it was clear she was being swayed. 
Marissa couldn&#39;t knock her out, because she was being affected as well, 
by Lust. The older girl had slinked over, oblivious to the destruction, 
and soon had wrapped naked arms and legs around her pale frame.

&quot;Don&#39;t feel bad,&quot; she sang. &quot;I can make all this pain go away. And 
you&#39;re so beautiful, too! Why, I bet you think nobody loves you! I would 
like nothing more than to be your soulmate, forevermore, my ethereal 
beauty.&quot; Marissa was unaccustomed to such adoration, and even if Lust 
had not inherited dark powers from her Master, she would&#39;ve easily 
swooned. Nobody had ever felt that way about her, ever. And this girl 
was so wonderfully perfect, her sweet lips closing in like two buds of a 
honey-flower...

&quot;YAAAAH!!!&quot;

An animalistic growling broke Lust&#39;s concentration, and the flying 
tackle that came after it nearly broke her shoulder. Lurker had seen the 
two and came flying across the room like a panther, striking the siren 
full-on. She now had Lust pinned on the floor, snarling and snapping, 
her diamond-hard claws clutching Lust&#39;s arms tight. The hypnotic woman 
squirmed under the weight of the creature, but was too afraid and too 
weak to move. She opened her eyes and decided to seduce the creature, 
but...

&quot;Ugh! What a hideous monster! Get her off me, now!&quot;

&quot;I AM NOT A MONSTER!&quot; roared Julie. Envy stared, knowing it was up to 
her, but...what good would her powers do? This creature was even uglier 
and more decrepit than she was, and seemed to miss so much from her life 
that even Envy had. She could not bring her down, though she tried hard. 
Lurker attacked her next, and took a swipe at her face, cleanly raking 
four bloody lines on her cheek. Suddenly the girl stood, sniffing the 
air.

&quot;Bad feelings!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Bad things come! But bad things also 
come to bad people who hurt Julie&#39;s friends! Fiends!&quot; With that she 
raked her claws on Lust&#39;s shoulders, causing the girl to scream in a 
very un-hypnotic way. Envy broke her hold on Alisti, who looked ready to 
blow apart everything in sight, and fell to the floor. Lurker tackled 
her as well, throwing back a look of unusual ferocity to Marissa.

&quot;Go!&quot; she howled. &quot;I take care of them! Alisti must leave!&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;Merry in trouble too! I fight them easy! Merry almost done for!&quot;

&quot;My God...&quot; Gasping in fright, Marissa picked up Alisti from her chair 
and dashed away, heedless of danger. Alisti protested again, but there 
was no going against it: Marissa raced desperately for her closest 
friend, and would have nothing get in her way. Tragically, she stumbled 
on a piece of plaster that had fallen from the ceiling, and flung Alisti 
by mistake into some dark corner. She limped to her feet, wincing 
terribly with every step. Her ankle had been twisted, but she would have 
to ignore it. She would rather lose her whole foot than Merry&#39;s precious 
life.

Pain was now the least of Marissa&#39;s worries as she stumbled into the 
room where Merry stood her ground. The poor girl, in spite of her armor, 
was terribly fatigued, but more so than she should&#39;ve been. Marissa 
gasped as she saw the culprit: a weak-looking man reclining safely in a 
chair, his arms tied and his head drooping slightly, a smile of frail 
cruelty on his mouth. Even as she watched him work his terrible curse, 
Marissa felt weary as well, and knelt to one knee as her energy sapped.

&quot;Good...night,&quot; whispered the man, Sloth. He laughed hoarsely and tilted 
his head back and forth in amusement. Rancor trembled and almost fell. 
Then something came over Marissa, a spark of power and rage she had 
seldom felt before. She stood up strong again, and focused every bit of 
her energy on Sloth. The wave was so terrible that it pushed him back 
out of the whole compound, and nearly everything else in the room, 
including Rancor. The whole place was flattened and blown away, leaving 
Merry with nothing to hold but her own arms, and Marissa with a killer 
migraine.

She screamed and dropped. Merry was at her side, and hoisted her friend 
up, breathlessly exclaiming how brave she was and how deep in debt she 
was. But their troubles weren&#39;t over yet, and the invaders were still 
out there, wreaking havoc. It was going to be a long, terrible day.

......

Avarice made his way to Shalis&#39; room all by himself. He apparently knew 
where to go, for his powers enabled him to zero in on sources of wealth 
and information, and what better place to look than the Technomancer&#39;s 
own personal database? He allowed himself to walk right inside, waved 
politely to an amazed Shalis, and shot a tranquilizer dart into her 
neck. The young woman was mildly surprised, and stood to meet her 
attacker. Avarice shot her with one more, successfully felling her, then 
stepped over her body to reap the benefits of his labors.

What a find! It would take ages for him to download and process all that 
information, but he had not become such a tycoon for nothing, and could 
easily copy the entire system into his own network. This is what he 
programmed the computer to do (luckily for the Lost, he could not access 
some of the top-secret files that Shalis had protected, nor could he 
destroy them), and simply stood there looking at Shalis nap. He 
shrugged, seeing no further point in staying, and walked away to rejoin 
his comrades in victory. The woman would burn or be crushed no matter 
what; why waste energy killing her?

Avarice was long gone and the whole place was nearly an inferno when 
Namie found Shalis at long last. The woman was still out cold, even 
though her heart was mechanical, and would not recover quick enough on 
her own. Namie cradled the older woman close to her body, aching to 
touch that rough skin even for a moment. The impossibility of such 
intimacy gnawed at her heart terribly, and she wept as she squeezed 
Shalis close to her bodysuit and clothes. Sighing, she resigned herself 
to at least wake the woman up, and removed one of her gloves.

&quot;Forgive me,&quot; she whispered as she lightly touched Shalis&#39; torso. The 
burning sensation immediately woke her up, and she screamed for a good 
while before calming down. The burn would heal in time&#151;that is, if the 
two ever escaped. Namie put her glove back on and helped the wobbly 
Technomancer to her feet, but it was no use. It was like trying to move 
a stubborn mule.

&quot;Forget about me,&quot; implored Torth. &quot;Go on, get out of here. At least you 
have something of a life to look forward to! Look at me! I&#39;m a monster 
amongst monsters! What do I have to look forward to? I may as well have 
died when...&quot; She stopped herself and grimaced, unable to cry. &quot;I have 
nightmares,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Nightmares that I&#39;m pregnant, and my baby is 
a cyborg. I&#39;m more machine than woman. That thing,&quot; she pointed in 
disgust, indicating the computer, &quot;is all I&#39;ve lived for. I&#39;ve kept my 
old company afloat from here, and they&#39;ve depended on me. That&#39;s why I 
keep to myself, out of duty. But even if I left this place and found 
some kind of life, it would mean that I would lose everything. I can&#39;t 
save my work. You go; I&#39;ll die with it.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t let that happen,&quot; Namie said strongly. &quot;I care for you too much 
to leave you alone. If you aren&#39;t leaving, then neither will I.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that. Your life will be much more important than mine after 
this place blows.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t hear it,&quot; said Namie, and she clung tight to Shalis, refusing 
to let go. Shalis actually shuddered, and wiped her hair away before it 
could brush against Namie&#39;s face. How ironic! It had been she, of all 
people, who had pulled Namie into the ranks of the Lost, and now she was 
returning the heartfelt favor, begging for her life! Shalis took a deep, 
strained breath, and looked deep into the younger woman&#39;s eyes. Such a 
noble soul reflected back at her!

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she managed. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be a burden. You&#39;re right. Help 
me up, and let follow what may after that.&quot;

......

Marissa and Merry both were exhausted and wounded, but they managed to 
limp their way through the compound in search of their friends. Marissa 
hated leaving Alisti behind, but she was probably in less danger than 
Rancor had been. Now they wanted to find her, reunite with Julie, and 
find Shalis and Namie again, if any of them were still alive. Marissa 
vaguely recalled the dark room Alisti had flown into when she stumbled, 
and let Merry force her way inside. What they saw chilled them both.

Alisti was on the floor, her body all but useless save for her head and 
arm, yet she seemed to be holding her own against one of the Seven. 
Unfortunately for everybody, that one was Wrath, one of the most 
dangerous to fight, and he had absorbed just about all he could stand 
from Alisti&#39;s destructive power. The girl had clearly been using her 
disintegration blasts quite liberally since parting with Merry, for the 
room she was in was almost completely destroyed. Yet even Wrath 
withstood her fury, and looked prepared to blast back. Marissa and Merry 
sensed what was coming and shouted.

&quot;NO!!&quot;

&quot;Feel my vengeance!!&quot; roared Wrath, blasting back with ten times the 
strength of Alisti&#39;s power. The whole room was instantly obliterated, 
and if Marissa hadn&#39;t shot up an impenetrable force field (made by her 
sheer willpower, it seemed), everything else in a two-mile radius 
would&#39;ve been wiped clean. Alisti barked in shock as her power was 
returned and magnified, and crawled away with her one good limb as Wrath 
laughed, breathed deeply, and demanded more.

&quot;You bastard!&quot; spat Rancor. Even Wrath might&#39;ve been troubled by her 
fury; he stood helpless as she chased after him and slammed her fist 
right in his nose, breaking it to pieces. The large muscular man was 
thrown down, and Merry might&#39;ve killed him if her head hadn&#39;t been 
screwed on so tight. She quickly picked Alisti up and raced out of the 
room, leaving Marissa to faint from power overload. Wrath chased after 
them, ignoring the young girl, and soon even they were, well, lost.

For a short time, Marissa lay there, groaning and whispering to herself. 
Unbelievable luck was with her, for if Wrath hadn&#39;t unleashed all that 
power (thus blowing off a portion of the building), she would&#39;ve died 
from smoke inhalation. As it stood, she had the whole crisp afternoon 
air to filter that out, and could lay in leisure. Of course, this was 
not the case, as the ground shuddered under the weight of a massive 
creature. Gluttony came by, belching loudly after having cleaned out the 
refrigerator (he had tried to eat some of the others, but they fought 
back), and noticed the smallish morsel before him.

To his eyes, Marissa looked as good as any banquet he had dined on, so 
he licked his lips and waddled over to her, thinking himself safe as 
long as she was unconscious. Marissa woke before he could touch her, but 
her head felt like it had been cracked wide open and stuffed with 
needles. Her powers were dangerous both to enemies and to herself, which 
was why she rarely used them. All she could do was groan and rub that 
poor noggin of hers as Gluttony advanced.

&quot;Don&#39;t you go anywhere!&quot; he laughed. &quot;Meat that&#39;s been running around 
too much ends up being stringy! Sit down for awhile! It&#39;s not like you 
can run; Master Omega has a keen eye on this place!&quot;

&quot;...Who?&quot;

&quot;Our Master!&quot; he laughed. &quot;Probably off hunting that White guy he 
mentioned.&quot;

&quot;You mean Mr. White? He&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;Huh, gee. I guess I should be glad I haven&#39;t eaten you yet. Otherwise 
Master Omega will have searched longer than necessary! Thanks!&quot; He 
chuckled and lunged after her, and grabbed her by the shoulder. 
Marissa&#39;s face went white&#151;not the pale-pink she had, but real milky 
white&#151;and though she struggled, she couldn&#39;t overpower the vast 
Gluttony. She decided to use her powers, wanting rather to have a bad 
headache than to be devoured. She focused her mind on his...

A sudden flash of bright light filled the whole room. Gluttony screamed 
and covered his eyes. Marissa was dropped, where she stumbled around 
blindly.

&quot;Follow me!&quot; said a familiar voice&#151;what choice did she have? Marissa 
picked herself up and ran, until she was outside of the compound and 
back in a more normal lighting. She vaguely feared being spotted by this 
Omega person, but her thoughts were mostly on the identity of her 
rescuer. When her vision cleared, she was startled to see who it was.

&quot;Sanaa?!&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; said Sanaa, taking her hand and running again. &quot;We don&#39;t have 
much time to lose! Just follow me and we&#39;ll be safe. I can evade them.&quot;

&quot;Wait, wait! My friends are still back there! We have to go save them!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t do that.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; Suddenly a massive explosion lit up the sky, and as Marissa 
forced herself to turn around, she screamed as the Lost compound was 
blown sky-high. Immense, unbearable flames overtook it, and smoke 
floated into the sky. Marissa yelled for her companions, but was forced 
away by Sanaa.

&quot;Let me go! Let me go, damn it! Let me go!!&quot;

&quot;Compose yourself!&quot; snapped the older girl, wriggling Marissa with her 
hands. &quot;Don&#39;t you get it? If you go back there, the sacrifice of your 
friends will have been in vain!&quot;

&quot;What sacrifice?!&quot;

&quot;They wanted you to escape, Marissa Wainright!&quot; she exclaimed. Marissa 
gasped&#151;she never recalled fully introducing herself to Sanaa before&#151;and 
the concept of her friends making such a sacrifice was even more 
disturbing. &quot;They wanted you safe,&quot; continued Sanaa, &quot;and so they made 
sure you could leave this place by distracting the Seven.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute! What do you mean? Why can&#39;t any of this make sense?!&quot;

&quot;Just trust me,&quot; she assured her, &quot;and keep running. We are by no means 
safe. Of course, I don&#39;t think we will ever be safe, but we can try. 
Hurry!&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Come with me,&quot; stated Sanaa firmly: &quot;If, that is, you wish to live.&quot;

Marissa knew she had no choice. Leaving her friends behind, perhaps all 
of them dead, was the worst thing she had ever done. Now, she wanted to 
know why, but answers were far and away.

A hauntingly similar ordeal had taken over the Battle Diva Enforcement 
Team, and on that same day no less. The girls (with Father Jacob and 
Thunder-Claw, of course) were just welcoming a new member of the team, 
the mute girl known as Skye. They knew her from the Area and the great 
trip to the beach they had shared with the Lost, and were happy to have 
their ranks increased. But joy was soon drained from their faces, for a 
shadow of evil overtook that place, borne on the wings of terrible 
agents.

Father Jacob sounded the alarm: invaders had come, four this time, and 
they had already made it to the temple. The whole team, counting the 
men, were now eight strong, so they believed they could win. But the 
four invaders were only a deception: two more were well on the way, both 
of them easily more powerful than all the Divas combined. Not knowing 
this, the BDE met their four invaders zealously, sizing them up before 
the battle.

One was a gold-skinned creature, its head bearing a massive crown and 
its arms, all six of them, carried weapons; it was called Indira. Still 
another was a wisp of a beautiful man, carrying his frame on the wind 
high above; he was Yan. The third was a child, dressed in animal skins, 
carried on the back of a large bear; he was Valmont. The fourth was a 
woman, stoic and hawkeyed, bearing a nasty-looking crossbow in her arms; 
she was Yubami. They were but four of the Dead Zodiac, and four was more 
than enough to conquer the Battle Divas.

The great fight carried out with just as much blood and confusion as the 
fight between the Seven and the Lost earlier. Indira could&#39;ve very well 
taken on everyone there by itself, whirling like a typhoon as its 
weapons made blurs in the air. Yan battled with Skye and G-Force, the 
only ones who could pose him any kind of threat, but he laughed and blew 
them away with mighty gusts, or sent them hurtling to the ground&#151;or 
worse, calling on his own typhoon to flatten everyone.

Valmont was obviously no threat on his own, but he had summoned an army 
of animals, great and small, to overwhelm everyone. A pride of lions 
came out of the forest, flanked by a murder of crows above in the sky, 
and a pack of wolves and wild dogs alongside. Even the insects were on 
his side, for a swarm of bees were chasing people around, sometimes 
landing kamikaze stings (though Mora, with her hard scales and immunity 
to venom, tried to act as a shield). Yubami climbed the temple to its 
very top, aided by Yan, and stood with her crossbow, firing precisely to 
make sure nobody would leave the battle. Every one of the Divas was 
challenged.

But the battle became impossible to win after a quarter-hour of 
fighting. The ground trembled from an earthquake, and yawned open, 
making way for a colossus of stone and earth. The giant towered over 
everything, even the temple, and with a single lumbering step, had 
dislodged everyone from their feet.

&quot;There is no way in hell we can fight that!&quot; spat BK Power. &quot;God, who do 
they think we are?&quot;

&quot;Oh, stop complaining!&quot; snorted Yan. He threw a small gust at her and 
flew off to retrieve Yubami, who looked perfectly happy on her perch. 
She quietly clung onto him and was carried down just in time: Titus the 
Golem leaned over the Battle Diva&#39;s temple, and with its large rocky 
arms, began to demolish it mercilessly.

&quot;NO! Our temple!&quot; Siren ran after the gigantic monster, screaming 
uselessly, but was stopped by the sixth and last of the Zodiacs to join 
the fray. A mere blow knocked her to the floor, where she lay helpless. 
The man stood over her, crossing his arms, and glared at everyone.

&quot;This I prophesy,&quot; he whispered eerily: &quot;Lost you shall be, and lost 
shall be your destiny! You may soon be glad of shadows, and one dearest 
to your hearts will be denied herself and thrown into the furnace. Yes. 
One amongst your numbers shall soon fly on the back of a great bird, and 
I can see myself casting you down to the earth! All who draw breath 
shall perish; it&#39;s merely a question of who goes first.&quot;

&quot;What is your business?&quot; grumbled Father Jacob. The man before him, old 
and wild, grinned maliciously. His name was Ezekiel the Seeker.

&quot;My business is my own. I was sent here by my master, the illustrious 
Thirteenth, to give a warning! Thou shalt not cross the Dead Zodiac.&quot;

&quot;But we don&#39;t even know who&#151;&quot;

&quot;You have been warned,&quot; said Ezekiel sternly. He then looked up, towards 
the immense golem destroying the remains of the temple, and waved his 
arm. The creature stopped, turned to the Divas, and slowly lumbered 
their way.

&quot;Uh...girls?&quot; muttered G-Force.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Do you suppose that thing is...&quot;

&quot;Coming our way?&quot; The team trembled as one as the monster drew 
fanatically close in just two steps. It was slow, but gained colossal 
ground with each step, and soon was almost towering over them. Ezekiel 
grinned wildly.

&quot;Be flattened into the ground, you vile worms!!!&quot;

&quot;Not if I have anything to say about it!!&quot; A voice cried out to the 
girls, and from out of the sky, a large spoon, of all things, wedged 
itself into the ground. Ezekiel leaped back and stared at the source of 
the object.

&quot;What lunacy is this?&quot; he demanded. A figure stood in the distance, 
darkened by the sun behind him, and stood proudly with another spoon in 
his hand.

&quot;The villainy that springs forth from the horizon has been drifting 
around like a disease for far too long! Now is the time for all heroes 
to take a stand and fight back against this tyranny! I, the Purple Spoon 
Man, shall be the first to answer this call! Back, devil!&quot; Another spoon 
hurled through the air, straight towards the golem; a wide purple beam 
struck it as it twirled in midair, suddenly making it enormous. The 
spoon then sailed after Titus, and buried itself deep inside the 
monster&#39;s stone belly. Titus grumbled from the shock and glanced down at 
the weapon sticking out of it.

&quot;Heroes of all kinds!&quot; cried the so-called Spoon Man. &quot;I hope my aide is 
not too late! Come and retreat; you shall have other days to fight!&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s you,&quot; said Thunder-Claw, who remembered the odd man. Skye 
recognized him too, and helped gather the other Divas into their great 
van as the Spoon Man distracted Ezekiel and the other Zodiacs, tossing 
spoons into the air wildly. Ezekiel himself, shielding his face from the 
flying utensils, ran back and barked at Titus, who was still stunned.

&quot;You wretched buffoon, pull that contraption out of your body and pursue 
them! Do not stop until they are ground under your foot!&quot; Poor Titus, 
brainless and impaled, couldn&#39;t understand the order, and resumed 
smashing the temple (although he did pull the spoon out first and fill 
in the hole). The others pursued, but by then, the Battle Divas were 
long gone&#151;and so, it seemed, was their home and legacy.

It was indeed a day of tragedy, but the worst was still to come.

To be continued...

Even superheroes have frailties: the Lost might all be dead, Marissa is 
on the run with her mysterious benefactor, the Divas are driven from 
their home, and the evil in the world grows larger with each passing 
moment. It is Marissa, though, who will face the greatest burden, as she 
learns more about herself than she bargained for in the next chapter! 
Some questions may finally have answers next time in &quot;Downfall&quot;. Stay 
tuned!</pre>
