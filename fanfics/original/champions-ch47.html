<a href="../original/champions-ch46.html">Back to Part 46</a><pre>Reformation of the Seven

As the others were filling Mora in on everything that had happened since 
her absence (she, in turn, regaling her own exciting story), the man in 
white looked at the Seven, those now totally fallen both from grace and 
power.  With an iron stare he lifted them up and commanded them to 
approach him.  Nobody was in a position to argue or refuse, not even the 
lazy Sloth.  He actually surprised a few people by standing on his own 
two feet and trudging forth like a zombie.

&quot;Wonder what&#39;s going on,&quot; Mora said, observing the spectacle.  She let 
out a weary gust and fell bottom-first onto the ground, too beaten to 
even stand.  &quot;Not that I really care,&quot; she added; &quot;I&#39;m too tired to.  
Anybody seen what happened to the old man I was fighting?&quot;

&quot;I believe he landed in that direction,&quot; Kathryn pointed.  A small team 
ran out to see, and winced as they came across the flattened old man, 
dead as dead could be, his ghastly face thankfully buried in the ground.  
For good measure, Julie poked him.

&quot;I&#39;ll bet he didn&#39;t see that coming,&quot; muttered Sally.  She shuddered and 
looked away, and soon everyone made a note to not approach the body.  
They were more interested in what was happening now:  the Seven had all 
gathered around the strange man in white, not a one of them resembling 
their old wicked selves.  Wrath still shivered in fear, Lust and Pride 
were ugly, Gluttony looked sick with starvation, Envy held herself and 
wept, Sloth wheezed with exhaustion, and Avarice stood cold and naked, 
save for a scrap improvised for a loincloth.

&quot;Your master is dead,&quot; announced the white one, and his smile returned 
and the glow he had been covered with was now gone; his old self.  &quot;You 
are without guidance.  Accept your defeat.  Now is the time for you all 
to receive the fruits of your labor.  As you have sewn seven great evils 
in your life, so too will you be afflicted with torment fitting your 
crimes.  This is the price all men and women must pay for their sin.  
Holivx Dirge, come forth.&quot;

Wrath&#39;s fear intensified, and he looked like a little child summoned to 
see an angry school principal.  With Omega gone and his influence lost, 
the mind of the man became clear.  So many wrongs, he had done so many 
wrongs!  How could he, a man who once valued justice, have stooped so 
low?  Perhaps he, more than any of the others, was remorseful for his 
sins and acknowledged his sentence.  The man in white placed his naked 
hand on Holivx&#39;s forehead, making the man scream in pain.

&quot;I sentence you to a life of service, where you will make up for your 
wrongs, work off your debts with your own toil, and suffer as those you 
have harmed did suffer.  In a year&#39;s time, if you have reformed, this 
sentence will be revoked and you will be given your freedom.  Perhaps 
some day you will realize, Holivx, that justice is not the only right in 
this world.  You are dismissed.&quot;  The man once known as Wrath wept, 
bowing several times as he stepped back.  So, that was his punishment.  
It was a fitting one.

&quot;Christine Velshoni, come forth.&quot;  Now Envy toddled up, still clutching 
Aura&#39;s coin, looking more pathetic by the minute.  Mr. White touched the 
palm of her right hand, making her scream in pain.  &quot;I sentence you to a 
life serving and aiding the poor.  For your crimes of envy, you are to 
live in the worst conditions, aid those who are even less fortunate than 
you, and enjoy not but what you have earned.  In this I hope you mend 
your ways!  In a year&#39;s time, if you have indeed reformed, I shall 
revoke this sentence and you will be freed.  Perhaps with this, you will 
know what it means to be blessed, to not want what you do not need, and 
to be content.  You are dismissed.&quot;  The woman once known as Envy wept 
as Wrath had before her, and bowed as she joined Holivx.  Even with this 
she was grateful:  he had been very generous to her, and so had Aura.  
Their generosity had opened up her rocky heart; now she was ready to 
open it more.

&quot;Rosalyn Eden, come forth.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious!&quot; she exclaimed.  &quot;Look at me!  I&#39;m scarred for 
life!  That freak destroyed me!  Now I won&#39;t even be loved by a blind 
man!  Don&#39;t you think this is punishment enough?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he stated in a powerful voice.  &quot;My punishment is far, far worse, 
Rosalyn!  Alisti Kreager, come forth!&quot;  Alisti, the Disintegrator, 
winced as he called her name.  She wasn&#39;t one of the Seven!  She hadn&#39;t 
done anything wrong&#151;well, nothing that bad.  ...Not recently, anyway.

WHAT?

&quot;Come here,&quot; he beckoned.  Alisti looked to Skye, who could only nod 
solemnly.  She snorted, and wheeled herself up, glaring at Mr. White 
with her wild eyes.  He just smiled and clasped her only operable hand, 
then took Lust&#39;s.  As soon as they both touched him, something like 
lightning boomed, sending a mighty flash of light and crash of sound.  
Both Alisti and Lust screamed as they were thrown back, Alisti clean out 
of her chair, and for awhile neither woman moved.  Then, in spite of 
everything that had happened, something even more horrible and 
entrancing occurred that made a few people weep in fear.

Alisti Kreager stood up to her full height.

Rosalyn Eden wailed in misery.

They were amazed at what happened to them.

She could feel herself standing, and her fingers&#151;all of them&#151;flexing 
just fine.  She could move her hips, and her knees, and for the first 
time since her birth, her mind was clear and calm, no longer raging in 
anger and sorrow.  She took a deep breath, stepped forth, and stumbled, 
just like a baby might&#39;ve.  She gave out a small yell and was frankly 
shocked to hear that she really had a voice.

&quot;...I can talk,&quot; she whispered, staring at her hands and her friends and 
the world again in a whole new light.  She gasped and wept:  &quot;I...can 
speak.  This is my voice.  This is my mind.  I can talk.  I&#39;m...all 
right again.  I&#39;m all right!&quot;  She laughed and hugged herself&#151;then 
realized just why she could stand and move and talk.  Alisti Kreager 
gasped in amazement as she saw, for the first time, she was no longer in 
her body.

Rosalyn Eden was.  Or, to be more precise, she was now in the body that 
had once belonged to Alisti.  Stricken into that cursed shell, she 
wailed around helplessly, her legs dysfunctional and her hand limp.  
Words could not come from her mouth, only ugly moans and cries, and a 
million thoughts of rage, confusion, exhaustion, grief, and astonishment 
clouded her mind until she thought she would explode.

HELP!  Everyone jerked back as they heard the voice.  It did not sound 
like Alisti; it sounded like Lust.  WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!  WHAT 
HAVE YOU DONE?!  WHERE AM I?!  THIS ISN&#39;T...OH, GOD!  GOD IN HEAVEN!  
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!!!

&quot;Unbelievable!&quot; exclaimed Stevenson, who understood things first.  &quot;He 
just...switched their bodies!!&quot;

&quot;WHAT!&quot;

WHAT!

&quot;Alisti is now in Lust&#39;s body!&quot; he exclaimed, pointing to the startled, 
scarred, beautiful, standing Alisti.  &quot;And Lust...oh my God...&quot;  Even he 
shuddered and fell to his knees, unable to bear what had just happened.  
Alisti, her mind and soul transferred to Lust&#39;s body, shivered and wept, 
but even she didn&#39;t know which emotion the tears came from.  The Seven 
all looked ill, even Sloth.  Lust&#39;s punishment was to have that hideous 
body!!

&quot;Settle down,&quot; said Mr. White, his voice reaching everyone and silencing 
them.  He helped the woman formerly known as Lust into her chair, then 
addressed her again:  &quot;This is your punishment, Rosalyn.  You have used 
your wonderful body far too sinfully, and for that, you are reduced to 
this pathetic shell.  Alisti,&quot; he indicated, &quot;a far better person than 
you,  is thus gifted with your body, thankfully with none of your 
skills.  She has earned this; to her I give your skin, your beauty, your 
own self.  And you...shall soon know what it means to be cursed.&quot;

I HATE YOU!!!!

&quot;No doubt,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;But I am not without heart.  Holivx and 
Christine shall take care of you, as is their punishment.  You just have 
to cope with this form for a year.  If you have reformed by then, I have 
it in my powers to give strength back to your legs and arm, thoughts to 
your mind, and speech to your voice.  But you shall never be freed from 
this body for as long as you live.  Do you understand?&quot;  Rosalyn just 
screamed hopelessly, loud and long, until her voice died and her mind 
took over.  Alisti was still in shock, and had to sit down before she 
fainted.  Skye approached her, not quite sure what to make of all this.

Alisti?  Are you...there?  Alisti blinked (with Lust&#39;s eyes), looked up, 
and saw Skye, still pretty and patient and wonderfully understanding.  
She extended her right arm, the one that had been disabled in her own 
body, and clasped it around Skye&#39;s hand.  She then smiled and pulled 
herself up, embracing the other woman.

&quot;It&#39;s...me,&quot; she whispered, hearing her own voice.  She did not have 
Lust&#39;s sultry sound; this was her own.  She didn&#39;t say anything else; 
she just embraced Skye and stared endlessly into her eyes, forgetting 
for a moment that she could now speak.  But the words wouldn&#39;t do her 
any good anyway; this was a moment reserved for silence.

Ignoring them for the moment, Mr. White then turned to his next 
penitent.

&quot;Edward Nashiyori, come forth.&quot;

Scarred, burned, and naked save for the piece of fabric around his 
waist, the man once known as Avarice could only crawl.  He scowled, 
though, resistant to the end, and only lowered his head because he could 
not bear to look at the harsh, sickly-smiling face of his judge.

&quot;Your punishment is great,&quot; said Mr. White, almost in pleasure.  &quot;First 
I will siphon every last measure of currency and value from everything 
you possess and give it to those who need it most.  You will be 
penniless in a week!&quot;

&quot;What!  No!&quot; he screamed, desperate and wild.  Thirteen went on.

&quot;Once you are completely bankrupt, you will live with the others.  I 
have arranged it so that every one of you will have the same lodgings.  
You will live in a small, poor, destitute village, and there you are to 
labor until your sins are swept clean.  You, Edward, shall help with the 
poor, along with Christine.  There maybe you will learn what value 
really means.  I hope to see you reform.&quot;  Nashiyori scowled, of course, 
but he couldn&#39;t match the white one&#39;s gaze, nor rebuke him for his 
sentence.  He could only back away, broken into pieces, left to wallow 
in his own ruin.  Only Edward, out of all the seven there, entertained 
thoughts of vengeance and rebellion; the ones before him seemed willing 
to comply.

&quot;Frederick Revini,&quot; called Thirteen.  Since he was still bound in 
Xianq&#39;s gum wrapping, Gluttony had to be dragged by Kristen.  He could 
barely even stare at the man in white, who with but a humble nod 
dissolved the bind.  &quot;Hungry?&quot; hissed he, making Edward wince in agony.  
&quot;Good.  Your punishment will be particularly nasty.  For a single week 
you will be unable to eat anything!  Just as Midas before you was unable 
to feed himself for his greed, so shall you.  That which you touch shall 
turn into dust, and you will starve for a week.

&quot;Afterwards,&quot; he continued, ignoring Frederick&#39;s pale face, &quot;you will be 
forced into labor befitting your crimes.  For six months you will never 
be able to eat more than what is necessary to sustain your life, though 
surrounded by banquets you may be.  After this period, you will only be 
given what you have worked for, not a crumb more.  If by a year&#39;s time 
you have reformed, this punishment shall be lifted.  But have a care!&quot; 
he warned.  &quot;Should you, or any of you, return to your evil ways, a far 
deadlier sentence will you receive!  Now, begone.&quot;

Frederick actually wept and covered his face as he slowly waddled away.  
He wanted to rebel, of course, but he loved food far too dearly and was 
too frightened of the curse to do anything.  Some of the others looked 
at him in pity (or worse); Rosalyn had finally stopped wailing and was 
being quiet, though anyone could tell she wanted to be alone.  There 
were only two left, possibly some of the most incurable cases yet.  But 
of course, they were up against somebody that had obliterated their 
master with a mere snap of his fingers&#151;what could they do?

&quot;Timothy Grotin.  Come forth.&quot;

Despite his pain, both physical and egotistical, the man known as Pride 
scowled furiously.  No&#151;that wasn&#39;t his name, not any more!  He had 
changed it; he was Hanz Himmler, the perfect man, and 
nobody&#151;nobody&#151;would address him as anything less.  Of course, he could 
no longer have such esteem now that his once-beautiful face was scarred 
by acid, his victories destroyed, his master gone, and his allies 
defeated.  He walked up to Mr. White, and in spite of his pain, crossed 
his arms and sneered.

&quot;Kneel,&quot; commanded Thirteen.  A fear ten times greater than anything 
Joyce could deliver overcame Hanz&#151;Timothy, that is&#151;and not only did he 
kneel, but he became prostate and let his forehead touch the floor.  
That Mr. White still smiled made the scene all the more sickening to 
watch, even for those who hated Hanz.  &quot;I have a simple punishment for 
you, Timothy,&quot; said Mr. White:  &quot;Take a look in this mirror.&quot;  Hanz then 
realized that he had not yet seen his disfigured face, nor, now that he 
thought about it, did he want to.  But some godless power forced him to 
look, and as he stared at the monster in the reflective glass (produced 
from some invisible pocket of space, maybe), he wailed and thrust his 
hand against the damned object.

&quot;This disfiguration is punishment enough!&quot; shouted Thirteen above 
Pride&#39;s racket.  &quot;Bear it well, Timothy!  For one year you are to look 
this way, twisted and ugly, and like your comrades, I require you to 
labor in the village and help those unfortunates afflicted by the 
tragedies you caused.  I especially give you the personal care of 
Rosalyn, who shares a similar physical burden.  May you love each other 
in your monstrous appearance!  In a year&#39;s time, perhaps, many of those 
scars will be healed, and you will gain some semblance of a human face.  
But you shall never be the same.&quot;

Poor Hanz was still distraught over seeing his ruined face to accept or 
deny his punishment.  He fell to the ground and keened like a baby, and 
would not be silenced.  Even Christine looked at him in pity, if not 
disgust.  She knelt by his deformed body and started to help him up, but 
he swatted at her and tumbled away, going only a few steps before 
tripping and falling in the dirt.  Most people couldn&#39;t bear to watch, 
and turned their focus on the last of the Seven to receive judgment.

&quot;Walter Barsnef, come here.&quot;  He had no choice:  the man once known as 
Sloth actually walked up, gazing fearfully into Mr. White&#39;s smiling, 
eerie face.  He was not asked to kneel.  &quot;Feeling tired, are we?&quot; asked 
he, sounding gleeful.  &quot;Good, that is good.  Your punishment will be the 
most difficult, I would wager.  You shall have the brunt of the physical 
labor placed upon your shoulders.  You will work as a Son of Father 
should work, and grind yourself into the dirt until you are utterly 
spent!  A taskmaster shall be assigned to you; the more you work, the 
less you will feel his wrath.  As with the others, if you have changed 
by a year&#39;s time, this burden shall be lightened.&quot;

&quot;And if not?&quot; spat Edward.  Mr. White&#39;s smile suddenly turned very vile, 
and Nashiyori shuddered.

&quot;Pray you never find out, O Man.  Now...go.&quot;

&quot;Wait,&quot; called a voice, one belonging to Holivx.  &quot;Wait.  Don&#39;t send us 
away yet, please.  Not yet.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;  He took several gasping breaths, turned, and faced those he 
had harmed, a look of grief and regret now in his eyes.

&quot;Because...I owe the people here a debt.  I, more than any of the 
others, should have repulsed the evil in my system.  That&#39;s why I 
deserve this&#151;not because of my sins, but because I welcomed them!  
However, I would like to help; a small way of making amends.&quot;  Kristen, 
probably the one who had fought him the most, scoffed.

&quot;You?  Help us?&quot;

&quot;I apologize for everything,&quot; he said, full of sorrow.  &quot;I know I can&#39;t 
make it up to you, but let me at least try!  I have some information 
regarding the other cult members.&quot;

&quot;...And that is?&quot;  He sighed.

&quot;Without Mast...  Without Omega, they will go berserk and avenge him.  I 
heard there are at least five thousand members scattered worldwide, and 
they will all converge here, at this point, to take out the ones 
responsible.&quot;

&quot;So?  You&#39;ve seen how Mr. White blasted Omega.  He can just blast them 
too.&quot;

&quot;I do not kill humans,&quot; said Thirteen coldly.  &quot;That is not my task.  If 
you wish to defend yourselves and the city, this job falls to you.&quot;

&quot;...You&#39;re kidding!&quot; spat Rin.  &quot;Five thousand?!  And you won&#39;t even 
help?!&quot;

&quot;Actually,&quot; murmured Christine quietly, &quot;it&#39;s...eight thousand.  
Eight-thousand, two-hundred, thirty-seven to be exact.  That does not 
count the other army.&quot;

&quot;What other army?!&quot; screamed the Ronin.  Christine stood up and 
shivered; she too looked remorseful for everything she had done, and 
wanted to help.

&quot;When we left him, Mast&#151;Omega was signing allegiances with two other 
people; I forget their names.  These two people are necromancers, able 
to bring back the dead.  I heard them whispering about summoning an army 
of undead warriors, all the great warriors from the past, and 
overwhelming the city, and all cities of the world.  I have no doubt 
that they&#39;ll try and join up with the cultists.&quot;

Rin Takamatsu, and most everyone else there, were so shaken by this news 
that they could do nothing but fall on the ground and sit.  Over eight 
thousand fanatics devoted to the vengeance of their master was far too 
much, but an entire army of undead warriors added to it?  It was 
ghastly, catastrophic news, and even the sturdiest hearts there quailed.  
Only Thirteen kept his smile; he seemed completely unconcerned.

MALCHIOR, came a hoarse croak from Rosalyn&#39;s direction.  She turned to 
look at the team assembled there and said, MALCHIOR.  HE IS ONE OF THEIR 
LEADERS.  HE&#39;S THE NECROMANCER.  AND...KISSA, I THINK, IS THE OTHER.

&quot;Damn!&quot; spat Rin angrily.  &quot;I knew she was no good!  Is this about me 
not killing any of those people on her list?&quot;

&quot;Probably not,&quot; muttered Kathy, holding Kailin&#39;s hand for support.  
&quot;This does not seem to be an act of retribution against you in 
particular; it&#39;s too encompassing.  I think it wouldn&#39;t make a 
difference even if you had done everything she asked.  I think she was 
planning this all along.&quot;

&quot;And you didn&#39;t tell us?&quot;

&quot;I said I think she was doing this,&quot; replied Kathy harshly.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t 
certain.  Not that there was anything I could&#39;ve done anyway, not in my 
condition.&quot;  Rin wanted to ask just what the young Angel&#39;s relationship 
to Kissa was, but was interrupted by Amielle.

&quot;Malchior...  He must&#39;ve been that guy we met in that graveyard, the one 
bringing up all those zombies.  You remember, don&#39;t you P&#151;Alicia?&quot;  She 
had frozen for but a second, frightened that she had given everything 
away.  At the last moment she redeemed herself, though Mr. White stared 
at her coolly.  Alicia nodded.

&quot;Then I guess we have a good excuse to kill them both!&quot; exclaimed Rin, 
brandishing her sword.  &quot;But how in the hell are we gonna fight that big 
huge army?  All of us put together couldn&#39;t make a dent in a group that 
size!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll come up with something,&quot; said Stevenson, rubbing his 
chin.  &quot;Right now we better rest, and send these seven away.  We&#39;re 
grateful for the news,&quot; he said to them, &quot;though it was pretty grim.  
But at least we&#39;re prepared.  That&#39;s some exoneration for you at least.&quot;  
The three that had divulged information nodded; the others were still 
miserable.  Christine spoke up next, slowly walking back up to Aura and 
bowing.

&quot;Here,&quot; she said, presenting the coin.  &quot;You take it.  I have a feeling 
you&#39;ll need it more than I will.&quot;

&quot;No, really, you keep it.  You need it.  I still have my powers, just 
not at full strength.&quot;

&quot;Then take this,&quot; she insisted, planting the coin in Aura&#39;s hands, &quot;and 
be at full strength.  Please.  This is the first time I&#39;ve ever given 
anybody anything, so please take it.&quot;  Aura smiled warmly and promised 
she would, but vowed to give it back once everything was settled.  Mr. 
White spoke up next, apparently trying to ease some minds.

&quot;I am sure this obstacle will be overcome, and I did not say I would not 
help.  I will just not kill a human being.  That is not my duty.  As for 
you,&quot; he addressed to the Seven, &quot;I may never see you again, but the 
council in the village will act as your judges.  May even your souls be 
redeemed; I take no pleasure in damning humans!&quot;  As he said this, a 
clear, clean wind swept across and (it seemed) literally blew the Seven 
from the eyes of their enemies into a dirty village square, the center 
of their new, permanent world.  Once they got their bearings, most stood 
and looked at their surroundings, some of them fearful and anxious.  In 
all their ugliness, Hanz and Rosalyn held hands, and Holivx stood with 
his head hanging, ready to face the trials.

.........

It was a long and grueling time for the seven of them in the village.  
The work was much harder than Thirteen had described to them, and the 
torture of having their sins cast back upon them made things even worse.  
Holivx immediately got to work and accepted his punishment, and in just 
a few short weeks had completely reformed and turned out to be quite a 
great man; his family was brought into the village later, and there they 
lived for the rest of their lives, Dirge himself later becoming 
appointed as a mid-level magistrate.  He still fought for justice, yes, 
but now that he knew the full meaning of grace, he worked for this as 
well.

Christine also set out to work as soon as she could, but once she dove 
into the deepest and darkest places there, she couldn&#39;t help but weep in 
sorrow.  The village was nearly flooded with people a dozen times more 
worse off than she had ever been!  Most had no clothes, little food, and 
their living conditions made her old shack look like a palace.  The 
granite that had formed around her heart quickly melted as she cared for 
them all, and soon she too reformed, ending up a very generous person.  
She still had some envy, of course, but she also had the discipline to 
work for what she wanted instead of merely going after it.

Only Rosalyn was excused from the hard labor, and for obvious reasons.  
Being trapped in Alisti&#39;s old body&#151;unable to move, think clearly, or 
even speak&#151;was terrifying, worse than Hell, and for awhile she wanted to 
die.  On the other hand, she did grow incredibly close to Hanz, who she 
could not see as ugly, and also became close friends with Christine.  
Rosalyn did finally mend her ways, and by the year&#39;s end wept for joy as 
she took her first steps (and said her first words) in her new body.  
Since she was unable to have children regardless of her condition, she 
merely adopted three orphans, and became a rather good mother.

For poor Frederick, every day was agonizing.  True to Mr. White&#39;s words, 
everything that could be considered edible, even paper, turned into dust 
and ashes whenever he touched them.  He wasn&#39;t even able to lift spoons 
or forks, and was forced to go on a juice diet just to sustain his 
sanity.  When he was first presented with real food, he wanted to gorge 
himself stupid&#151;but all he got was enough to live on, and considering his 
size, it wasn&#39;t very much.  This drove him to insanity and beyond 
several times, and there were days his colleagues feared for him.  It 
nearly took him the entire year to get his act straight, but by then, he 
had lost so much weight and gained so much muscle that he ended up 
becoming quite an attractive man, and drew some very hungry stares from 
the village women.  Needless to say, he considered this a fair trade.

Hanz kept himself distant from everyone for the first month there, save 
Rosalyn, and only worked when he was forced to, which was about all the 
time.  Rosalyn ended up being his rock and fortress during that time, 
and he became hers.  Working humbly for a change disgusted him, but 
seeing everyone else stoop just as low made the burden easier to bear.  
Later on, he started to volunteer for work, realizing that more people 
respected him when he was humble than when he had been full of himself.  
Hanz never quite got rid of all his pride, but there were some 
variations of it that should not go away.  He did turn out all right, 
though he never regained his beauty.  Instead he legally married 
Rosalyn, and became a father of three adopted children.

Like Frederick, Walter also had a tough time of things.  He still held 
onto his slacker ways, and spent every waking moment...well, asleep.  
This made his taskmaster hound him every day, yelling and even whipping 
him if he so much as sat down.  Walter tried to feign illness and 
weakness, but it was no good, and besides, he wasn&#39;t fed if he didn&#39;t 
work.  The year had in fact nearly drawn to a close before he started 
doing things right, but perhaps it was the grim promise of worse 
punishment that motivated him, nothing else.  Regardless, the 
middle-aged man did become a much harder worker and finally developed 
some muscle, though he always found some excuse to sleep an hour late.

Only Edward did not reform.  Out of all the Seven, his soul was the 
darkest, his lust the strongest, and his curse the most hopeless.  Not 
only did he not reform, but he actually started taking advantage of all 
the villagers, even stooping so low as to rob from the very poor he had 
been commissioned to help.  By the year&#39;s end, he was actually worse 
than when he had first started, leaving the village council no choice 
but to declare their sentence.  Edward was immediately executed that 
day, his body tossed in the sea, his assets divided, and his soul gone 
forever.  The remaining Seven still mourned him, though they did it 
fearfully, and worked even harder lest the same fate should befall them
