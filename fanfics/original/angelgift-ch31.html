<a href="../original/angelgift-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><pre>Allison nearly felt her knees give out on her, the
sensation of relief was so great, but she made herself
keep standing. The Queen still held on to her daughter
gently even as she studied Allison with a warm gaze,
the great chamber stretching out around them. Then her
eyes settled on Sharin and narrowed slightly, the
warmth fading a bit.

&quot;Uh oh,&quot; Sharin gulped softly under her ruler&#39;s stern
glance, the tall blonde trying to make herself as
small as possible.

Jen&#39;ai raised an eyebrow as she frostily addressed her
Questor, &quot;I take it retrieving Jenna was more
challenging than expected?&quot; Seeing Sharin visibly wilt
she relented, &quot;Though I know how stubborn my daughter
can be.&quot;

&quot;Mother,&quot; Jenna jokingly protested even as she gently
pulled free from her mother&#39;s grip, walking to
Allison&#39;s side.

Milly reached up to reassuringly squeeze Sharin&#39;s
shoulder as the little redhead said softly, &quot;I&#39;m glad
you&#39;re not in trouble.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Sharin agreed, reaching up to squeeze
Milly&#39;s hand gently.

With smooth grace X&#39;tahn had chairs brought out for
them, the group taking seats around the throne. The
white haired catgirl then brought out a cart of food
and drink before looking curiously at the Queen, &quot;Is
there anything else?&quot;

Surprisingly the queen reached up from her seat to
gently take X&#39;tahn&#39;s hand as Jen&#39;ai said, &quot;Stay,
please, I am comforted when you&#39;re near.&quot;

X&#39;tahn&#39;s voice was far warmer than a servant&#39;s
normally would be as she gently answered, &quot;Of course,
m&#39;lady.&quot;

&#39;I guess the rumors about them might be true,&#39; Jenna
thought to herself with a faint smile. She felt glad
to know that her mother had found such happiness,
especially considering what the Queen&#39;s marriage of
state had been like.

&quot;Should I...?&quot; Milly visibly hesitated, torn by the
idea of leaving her mistress or leaving them to their
possibly private discussions.

&quot;Stay,&quot; X&#39;tahn told the young woman firmly, &quot;I think
it will be all right.&quot;

Jenna gave everyone a moment to drink and relax before
she asked her mother the question that was on
everyone&#39;s mind, &quot;How goes the war? I&#39;ve seen the
communications from the Throne World, but I suspect
it&#39;s edited...&quot;

&quot;Not so much as you would think,&quot; Jen&#39;ai gently
reassured her daughter. &quot;The Star Empire has a
numerical advantage in battleships,&quot; her eyes were
faintly amused, &quot;but our technical advantages seem to
have put us at an equal footing.&quot;

Allison was intent, &quot;By how much?&quot;

&quot;According to our office of naval intelligence the
factor is nearly three to one in our favor,&quot; Jan&#39;ai
said serenely.

X&#39;tahn added, &quot;Though I would take that will a grain
of salt.&quot;

&quot;You think your intelligence service is padding the
numbers a bit?&quot; Allison raised her eyebrows in
surprise.

Sharin spoke up that time, &quot;ONI has been known to be a
bit arrogant about our own capabilities, though I&#39;d
have thought they&#39;d have grown out of it by now.&quot;

&quot;No such luck,&quot; Jen&#39;ai said serenely. She fixed a
amused glance on Allison, &quot;I suspect your own military
adventures have made a difference, too.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Allison blinked.

&quot;Many of our own younger captains have argued over our
strict adherence to battle customs, and your
unconventional successes have convinced them to try
new tactics,&quot; Jen&#39;ai actually grinned, &quot;to the dismay
of the Star Empire.&quot;

&quot;I told you that you were doing well,&quot; Jenna purred,
squeezing Allison&#39;s hand while the other woman blushed
charmingly.

&quot;So,&quot; Milly asked them a bit tentatively from where
she stood behind the others, &quot;what do we do now?&quot;

&quot;We return to the Throne system,&quot; Jen&#39;ai said, &quot;I
believe we have a wedding to prepare for.&quot;

&quot;You mean...?&quot; Sharin looked thoughtful.

X&#39;tahn nodded her agreement, &quot;The marriage of Jenna
and her consort will announce her return, not to
mention being a poke in the eye to those Star Empire
dogs.&quot;

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Allison managed to get out as Jenna squealed
in delight, grabbing her forcefully into a powerful
hug. She blushed brightly as Jenna kissed her, their
bodies rubbing together, even as the Queen and the
others looked on with gentle amusement.

&quot;This is going to be interesting,&quot; Milly fretted as
she walked over to X&#39;tahn&#39;s side, &quot;especially
completing all the preparations in the time we have.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry little one,&quot; X&#39;tahn smiled fondly at the
younger woman, &quot;we&#39;ll manage.&quot;

&quot;Are we going back to Throne system, then?&quot; Jenna
asked, still keeping a firm grip on the brightly
blushing Allison.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jen&#39;ai laughed. She smiled wryly, &quot;I know
I shouldn&#39;t have come to meet you, but with seventh
fleet standing guard there I felt it was safe enough.&quot;

&quot;You going to be all right?&quot; Sharin asked Allison
softly, looking at the younger woman with a degree of
humor.

&quot;I&#39;d be honored to marry Jenna,&quot; Allison admitted, a
blush still coloring her cheeks.

&quot;And I, you,&quot; Jenna kissed her again, ardently.

&quot;I almost hate to send you all back to your ship,&quot;
Jen&#39;ai said wryly, &quot;but the Liberty&#39;s Sword shouldn&#39;t
be without her captain.&quot;

&quot;And will you be considering another wedding?&quot; Milly
asked X&#39;tahn softly.

X&#39;tahn looked at the younger woman in surprise then
blushed faintly. &quot;I hope this isn&#39;t common knowledge,&quot;
she frowned.

&quot;I suspect that much of the royal household knows,&quot;
Milly confessed to her, &quot;but none of us have chosen to
reveal it to others.&quot; A smile, &quot;We hold you and the
Queen in too high a regard.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; X&#39;tahn murmured. She looked over to where
Jen&#39;ai talked to her daughter and friends, &quot;It would
be too risky, little one. The Queen could lose the
support of the nobility, something critical to this
war.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but she&#39;s winning the war,&quot; Milly said softly.

X&#39;tahn gave her a look then smiled faintly. &quot;And have
you confessed to your love yet?&quot; she asked her
teasingly.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Milly blinked.

&quot;I have seen you gazing at the Questor Sharin,&quot; X&#39;tahn
said cheerfully, &quot;or did you think no one noticed?&quot;

&quot;I am not interested in her,&quot; Milly protested weakly.

X&#39;tahn chuckled merrily, &quot;I&#39;ve known you for years,
child.&quot; She gently smacked her ear, &quot;Don&#39;t even think
of lying to me.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Milly winced, rubbing at her ear. &quot;All
right, I like Sharin,&quot; she conceded, &quot;but I don&#39;t
think she notices me.&quot;

&quot;What have you done to get her attention?&quot; X&#39;tahn
asked.

&quot;Pounced on her,&quot; Milly answered promptly.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; X&#39;tahn said thoughtfully then continued, &quot;you
do know our courting methods and humans are different,
right?&quot;

&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; Milly&#39;s tail lashed as she
fidgeted, &quot;what should I do?&quot;

X&#39;tahn noted how Sharin was looking at Milly and
smiled faintly. &quot;Oh,&quot; she said cheerfully, &quot;I think
we&#39;ll come up with something.&quot;</pre>
