<a href="../original/angelgift-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>        Sharin quietly made her way outside to the patio, breathing 
deep of the cool air, leaning up against the railing and gazing out at 
the twinkling stars. The blonde searched for her home sun for a little 
while but finally had to give up with a soft sigh, that point of light 
just too far away to see, even with her eyes.

        &quot;You miss it, don&#39;t you?&quot; the quiet voice asked her softly.

        Somehow, she wasn&#39;t too surprised to see Milly emerge from the 
shadows, the pretty redhead dressed in her maid&#39;s uniform. &quot;How do you 
do keep doing that?&quot; Sharin asked her crossly as the girl settled in 
to stand beside her.

        Milly flicked her tail, &quot;I am part cat, you know.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Sharin admitted.

        &quot;I know I miss it,&quot; Milly said softly, &quot;I miss the Queen&#39;s 
court. I miss the plots, the intrigue,&quot; her fangs showed as she 
grinned suddenly, &quot;why, I even miss protecting Mistress Jenna from all 
the suitors after her money and power.&quot;

        A surprised Sharin looked over at her curiously to ask, &quot;But 
why you aren&#39;t bothered by her and Allison being together?&quot;

        &quot;No, I&#39;m not bothered,&quot; Milly agreed. &quot;Allison hasn&#39;t got a 
clue that Jenna will someday be the queen of all of this,&quot; she 
gestured to the stars above them. More quietly she added, &quot;The 
feelings that Allison and her share are real.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve got a point,&quot; Sharin admitted. She returned her gaze 
to the stars, &quot;But you should remember that Jenna only inherits if the 
Queen doesn&#39;t disown her.&quot;

        &quot;True,&quot; Milly&#39;s tail began to lash back and forth, &quot;What was 
her majesty&#39;s mood like, when you left after Jenna?&quot;

        &quot;She certainly wasn&#39;t very happy,&quot; Sharin quietly admitted to 
Milly as she sent her thoughts back to a few weeks ago...

        Sharin paused for a moment at the great doors themselves, 
letting the guard who was standing there recognize her formally. All 
of the proper traditions had to be observed, even when one had been 
called forth by the Queen herself. The doors opened up grandly and 
with a gulp Sharin entered into the throne chamber itself.

        It was said that the monarch could see over all he or she 
ruled through the great viewscreens on all sides of this massive 
chamber, but for today the view was obscured. Countless courtiers and 
minor nobles scurried around the throne, all trying to get the 
attention of the woman now sitting on that uncomfortable throne.

        Taking pity on her Sharin loudly announced, &quot;The Questor 
Sharin is here on business most urgent with the Queen!&quot;

        A few nobles squawked out in protest, and Sharin smiled a 
cold, dangerous little smile. The smarter ones who knew her, either 
directly or by reputation, fled immediately and the rest ran when 
Sharin ignited her energy blade and charged the mob. With much 
bleating and cries of fear the nobles fled, leaving the Queen and her 
alone.

        &quot;A trifle overdone,&quot; the Queen noted with a little smile, &quot;but 
very effective.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Sharin let the blade dissipate as she smiled 
grimly, &quot;but considering my mood it was a real relief to cut loose.&quot; 
She took a nervous breath, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to report that I was to meet 
your daughter today, but she never turned up.&quot;

        The dark haired woman on the throne eyes&#39; darkened as she 
softly murmured, &quot;I know.&quot; She met Sharin&#39;s gaze steadily as she 
continued on gravely, &quot;It seems that my daughter Jenna has chosen to 
take her personal servant and flee.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Sharin blurted.

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; the Queen nodded grimly.

        &quot;But why?&quot; Sharin looked clearly confused. While she wasn&#39;t 
Jenna&#39;s best friend, she knew her fairly well, and had seen no signs 
that she was that unhappy.

        &quot;I knew she was displeased with the latest marriage meetings,&quot; 
the Queen sighed, &quot;they were not what she might have hoped for.&quot;

        Sharin winced. That was something of an understatement. She 
had seen the portly, older man, and the spindly, gray haired man whom 
the last marriage meetings had been with and felt relieved that her 
guardian hadn&#39;t sent them after her.

        Banishing those thoughts Sharin asked, &quot;How can I be of 
assistance, my Queen?&quot;

        &quot;Do you know where she would run to?&quot; the Queen asked Sharin 
intently. Much more softly she added, &quot;If Jenna does not return here 
to seal the agreements with a marriage, the consequences for us could 
be.. most dire.&quot;

        Sharin thought for a moment, &quot;I think she&#39;d run to the very 
rim of our colonized worlds, and maybe beyond that.&quot;

        &quot;Like some old holo-novel,&quot; the Queen murmured.

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Sharin agreed, &quot;but that&#39;s how Jenna thinks, my 
Queen.&quot;

        The Queen settled back in her seat and said, &quot;If you feel so 
certain, would you take up this Quest for me, Sharin?&quot;

        Sharin didn&#39;t hesitate, &quot;Of course.&quot;

        &quot;Then do and bring her home for me,&quot; the Queen ordered. As 
Sharin walked towards the doors the Queen added, &quot;Do so, and the 
rewards will be great. But if you fail me,&quot; she paused, &quot;I would not 
recommend returning at all.&quot;

        Sharin stepped through the doors, &quot;I understand,&quot;

        Milly was gazing up at Sharin in shock as she finished 
recounting her encounter with the Queen. &quot;What?&quot; Sharin finally had to 
ask.

        &quot;Was she truly so cold?&quot; Milly finally asked, clearly hoping 
that it wasn&#39;t so.

        Part of Sharin wanted to soften it, and she didn&#39;t quite 
understand why. As gently as she could manage she said, &quot;I&#39;ve never 
gotten a sense of the typical feelings between a mother and daughter 
with the Queen and Jenna.&quot;

        Milly nodded grimly, &quot;Please, don&#39;t tell Jenna what you just 
told me.&quot;

        &quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; Sharin promised. She moved to go inside, then 
paused, &quot;You asked me if I missed it, being back home?&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Milly looked over at her curiously.

        &quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; Sharin said quite seriously. &quot;Back home, I&#39;d be 
waiting to be married off, too. Here, I&#39;m free, more so than I&#39;ve ever 
been,&quot; she smiled. A short pause, &quot;And I&#39;d have never gotten to know 
you better back home.&quot;

        Milly looked a bit startled, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Sharin shrugged.
