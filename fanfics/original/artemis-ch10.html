<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 10 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/artemis-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Morning came too damn early for everyone, the sun
slowly cutting through the polluted haze of the city.
Athena groaned as she felt her headache pounding in
her head, the taste in her mouth reminding her of
something that had died. The blonde rolled out of her
bed, fighting the urge to be sick then stumbled over
to the suite&#39;s bathroom.

Mouth rinsed, cold water splashed on her face and some
mouthwash and Athena felt nearly human, a few steps
down from her usual state but she wasn&#39;t complaining.
&#39;Thank the fates I wasn&#39;t drunk enough to bring anyone
home with me,&#39; she noted her still empty bed with a
bit of regret. Not that some of the mortals last night
hadn&#39;t been pretty, but she hadn&#39;t been in the mood.

Putting on shorts and T-shirt she headed out, taking
off at a brisk jog around the block. She ran for
nearly an hour on her usual route, and by the time she
was done the sweat was streaking down her back.. but
her mind was clear and the night&#39;s aches and pains
were all gone as well. Ducking back into her apartment
she showered under cold water and changed to casual
clothes before heading over to the Daughters.

Walking between the apartment building and the bar she
could feel an electricity in the air, even her limited
mystic senses picking up on the mystic defenses that
watched over the whole set of buildings. She pushed
open the front door and headed in, the scent of
cleaning chemicals in the air.

A tired looking Diana waved as she entered then the
brown haired woman warned, &quot;Watch your step, we just
did the floors.&quot;

With a degree of caution Athena navigated over to
where Circe was washing down the top of the bar, &quot;You
should have woke me, I&#39;d like to have helped.&quot;

&quot;You had a rough night,&quot; Circe remarked, the blonde
looking at her in amusement.

Athena actually blushed faintly. Last night there had
been some trouble from a group of drunken college boys
and she had fallen into her now semi-regular role of
bouncer. Two of the boys decided they wanted to fight,
but they hadn&#39;t counted on Athena&#39;s over 2000 years of
combat experience. Even when they tried to attack
together she had handled them, dropping both boys to
the ground in a manner of minutes.

&quot;Several ladies and gents were asking about you after
that,&quot; Diana informed her with a certain amount of
glee, dumping her mop back into the bucket. Dressed in
old shorts and a smelly T-shirt it has hard to believe
this young woman was the goddess of the hunt.

&quot;Knowing your clients they&#39;d probably want to see me
all in leather wielding a whip,&quot; Athena noted as she
settled on one of the bar stools, &quot;no thanks.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Circe admitted.

&quot;Still, that sort of thing can be fun in moderation,&quot;
Diana pointed out.

Athena shook her head, deciding she didn&#39;t want to
know where Diana had learned that. &quot;So how are our new
guests doing?&quot; she asked curiously.

&quot;Descent and Sam helped unload the kegs of beer and
stock the larder this morning,&quot; Circe reported,
&quot;they&#39;ll be back to help with serving this afternoon.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d hire them full time if I could,&quot; Diana mused,
&quot;but I know they&#39;d turn me down.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure it&#39;s such a good idea to be sheltering
them?&quot; Athena asked. &quot;We don&#39;t need a feud with the
Lady in addition to our other problems,&quot; she said.

Circe shook her head with a smile, &quot;The Lady is scum,
Athena, sheltering her enemies is practically a public
service.&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Diana pointed out seriously, &quot;part of the
way the spells that shield us work requires us to
extend sanctuary to anyone worthy who asked.&quot; She
paused, &quot;And can you honestly say that they are not
worthy?&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Athena conceded. She smiled slightly,
&quot;I just thought I was obligated to present the other
argument.&quot;

&quot;Sometime you&#39;re a bit too much the goddess of
wisdom,&quot; Circe grumbled.

&quot;She was like that in Olympus, too,&quot; Diana sighed.

Deciding that it was safer to change the subject she
asked, &quot;Is there any news on the Jess and Alice
front?&quot;

&quot;Still not talking to each other,&quot; Diana said with a
sigh. The mystical community in this city was fairly
close knit, and gossip about them flew with the speed
of light. Diana seemed to enjoy keeping up with the
news, more than Athena did, to be honest.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Circe sighed. She looked thoughtful, &quot;I feel
pretty guilty about all of it, considering their blow
up happened here.&quot;

&quot;Considering Jess was juggling a fling with Elizabeth
and her dating Alice I don&#39;t think you can blame
yourself,&quot; Athena pointed out.

&quot;It happened under our roof, when I organized a circle
involving Jess and Elizabeth,&quot; Circe shrugged
uncomfortably, &quot;I still feel uncomfortable.&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t try to fix them up,&quot; Diana said firmly.
She smiled faintly, &quot;I remember the sort of trouble
our nephew Cupid could cause.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Athena agreed.

&quot;All right, all right,&quot; Circe raised her hands, &quot;I&#39;ll
stay out of it.&quot;

Athena checked the time and got up from the stool,
&quot;Sorry to say I have to bail, I have a kendo class to
teach at the community center.&quot;

&quot;You know kendo?&quot; Diana blinked in surprise. &quot;When did
you learn Japanese swordsmanship?&quot; she asked her

&quot;Considering how much globetrotting we all did after
the hall of Rome,&quot; Circe pointed out, &quot;that&#39;s a dumb
question, love.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Diana conceded with a blush as Athena quietly
slipped away.

&#39;I&#39;m glad they didn&#39;t press me,&#39; Athena thought as she
collected her wooden practice sword from her suite
then headed out at a quick jog down the street. She
went to a walk as she neared the old public school
that had been converted into a community center,
slowing a bit...

&quot;Banzai!&quot; she yelled, black hair flowing at she
attacked, leaping from the cover of a clump of nearby
bushes.

CLACK!

Smoothly Athena had drawn her practice sword from it&#39;s
case and parried the attack, meeting those flashing
eyes confidently. &quot;Slow,&quot; she said in unaccented
Japanese, &quot;but you&#39;re improving.&quot; From nearby the
others emerged, wooden swords ready as they studied
her warily, circling. &quot;Attacking as a group this
time?&quot; she asked them.

&quot;We will defeat you this time,&quot; the young man at the
lead said, brown hair flowing over his street clothes
as he pointed with his sword.

&quot;Come on then,&quot; Athena invited.

Without warning she charged, Athena breaking through
the circle before they could close it around her. In
less than two minutes she was surrounded by fallen
young people, separated from their weapons and clearly
defeated.

&quot;You know,&quot; the black haired young woman sighed as she
got up, &quot;when you promised to treat us to lunch when
one of us beat you, I figured we&#39;d be eating for free
in a week.&quot;

Athena helped pull her up, &quot;Yoriko, do you think I
would have made that vow if it was going to be that
easy?&quot;

&quot;Obviously not,&quot; the brown haired man laughed. He
grinned, &quot;Though personally I just think you&#39;re a
samurai movie otaku.&quot;

&quot;That too, Alec,&quot; Athena agreed cheerfully to the
laughter of the others. Raising her voice to the rest
of the group she called, &quot;Okay, everybody inside!
We&#39;ll start with standard drills.&quot;

&quot;Hai, sensei!&quot; they called as they all headed inside.

&quot;You know, when someone told me this was happening
every week I had to go see for myself,&quot; the amused
voice said. Turning Athena saw a woman dressed in
casual clothes, her red hair flowing over her
shoulders.

&quot;Keeps them motivated,&quot; Athena said, studying the
woman thoughtfully.

&quot;Margaret,&quot; she smiled slightly, unbothered by the way
Athena was looking over her. &quot;Do you think I could
observe your class?&quot; she asked boldly.

Athena raised her eyebrows, &quot;No.&quot;

Margaret watched the woman leave, her expression more
thoughtful than offended. &quot;This isn&#39;t the end,&quot; she
murmured to herself softly.

To be continued....

Japanese Note: &quot;Otaku&quot; is a word referring to a die
hard fan, often to the point of excess. A insult in
Japan it&#39;s considered something of a badge of honor
among western anime fans. &quot;Sensei&quot; is used for
teachers both academically and in martial arts.</pre>
