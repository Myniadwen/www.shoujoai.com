Lilia was shocked at that statement. &quot;No! Don&#39;t do it, Commander!&quot;

&quot;I have no choice, Lilia,&quot; Aarin said this whilst looking at Diana, &quot;If 
my death will pacify Diana&#39;s rage, then I have no options left. Setsuya 
brought this sadness to you by killing Zephaniah, did he not? He was my 
best friend. Hold me accountable for his alleged mistakes. If that will 
stop you from killing people... I will happily die on this very spot.&quot;

&quot;...Are you serious? You would die here and now?&quot; Diana was confused, 
and very cautious. 

The old master nodded. &quot;Yes. If it will end your bloodlust and your 
sadness, then you may take my life. I will offer no resistance 
whatsoever.&quot; 

Energy of the light blade began to flicker. Aarin noticed it but said 
nothing. Diana&#39;s heart was wavering. The woman stood transfixed before a 
downed Aarin, finally with her revenge at hand. After years and years of 
waiting and suffering. But... why was she hesitating? Surely this man 
deserved nothing but death? So why was Aarin being so noble and casual 
about this? 

This was not the way Diana pictured her revenge. This was not how she 
imagined it. It was strange. She felt something. Something as she looked 
into Aarin&#39;s bright brown eyes. It felt like she was staring into the 
eyes of the younger Aarin again. But rather than seeing the cold, 
uncaring disposition of young Aarin, she was now captivated by the 
warmth and kindness of the older version. And suddenly she was struck 
with the parallel shifting of their position.  

Aarin had once been an unemotional youth and now had become a tender 
loving man. Diana had once been a tender loving woman. Now she had 
become what Aarin once was. Cold and indifferent. But Diana had fallen 
much deeper than Aarin had been. This man was different from the one who 
had caused her so much pain. Now here she was... committing death 
against others. She was administering the same kind of agony that she 
had suffered all her life. Just what... had she become? 

Diana&#39;s energy blade began to shake harder at Aarin&#39;s throat. Suddenly 
her mind began to flash with memories of her past; the short time she 
and her husband-to-be were just a couple of crazy lovers... the days at 
which Zephaniah was not &#39;Zephaniah&#39; but the peaceful Aesus...

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Long lost words whisper slowly to you
Still can&#39;t find what keeps me here
When all this time I&#39;ve been so hollow inside
I know you&#39;re still there

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Hello, my name is Aesus... um... what&#39;s yours?&quot;

&quot;...D-Diana...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Watching me, wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Fearing you, loving you
I won&#39;t let you pull me down

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Aesus... I believe I should tell you... just how I feel...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to say it, Diana. I know. And I love you too.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Hunting you, I can smell you- alive
Your heart pounding in my head

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Diana... will you do me the honour... of being my wife...?&quot;

&quot;The answer... is yes...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Watching me, wanting me
I can feel you pull me down
Saving me, raping me
Watching me

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Tears slipped from Diana&#39;s eyes. Warm dewdrop sparkles dripping from her 
face and eyes, to the cold snow below her. Her beloved... defeated and 
broken, his corpse rested in tomb that had been forgotten by the world. 
The world which had corrupted both their lives. But it was a world they 
both hoped would see sense. 

In times of desperation, people either rally together, or turn against 
each other. Both Diana and Zephaniah were disgusted with the fact that 
mankind had chosen the latter. But by following this path of revenge... 
had Diana been perpetuating the rules and miseries of a world she once 
condemned? Had she sunk so low as to join ranks with the foolish hearts 
of the hopeless? So heartbroken that the flame of caring that Zephaniah 
had once loved about her was close to being extinguished? 

Aarin noted the tears in Diana&#39;s eyes. He was finally reaching her. 
&quot;It&#39;s your choice, Diana. You lack faith in this planet. Just like I 
once did. But then I met my beloved Gwendolyn. She showed me the beauty 
that still exists in this world. She brought me love. And though I miss 
her greatly since her death, I fight on. Because I know that she would 
have wanted me to live my life for the right reasons. Will killing me 
change your heart? Will killing Saizaki do anything but serve your own 
self-destruction? Would Zephaniah even have wanted to see you so 
unhappy? Or would he have wanted you to seek some form of peace, after 
all you have been through? You can end this now, Diana. End all this 
suffering... all this hate. So that the living may strive for a better 
world. One where happiness is our light... not this senseless carnage.&quot;

The energy sword at Diana&#39;s hand dissolved. She pulled both hands up to 
her face and stared at them with tenuous eyes. &quot;...My hands... have been 
stained... with so much blood...&quot; Her voice broke into sobs. &quot;So much 
blood...&quot;

As Diana began crying, Aarin finally stood upright. He heaved himself up 
to his feet, then walked over to the whimpering woman. He was careful at 
first, but then wrapped his arms around her, drawing her into an 
embrace. Diana collapsed into his arms, overwhelmed with the intense 
realization of all the things she had done. Aarin ran a hand through her 
hair, as she sobbed into his shoulder. Such was the power of this ruined 
world. To turn a peaceful woman into a maniacal murderer. And this war, 
this inane war without a purpose; was serving to divide people even 
further. Creating boundaries between kin and loved ones. Robbing food 
from the mouths of the hungry and passing it to the glutinous. The time 
had come to finish it. 

No more tragedy, no more hatred. It had to end. If this world was ever 
going to return to the peace it held nearly one hundred years ago, then 
someone would have to take a stand. And start by ending this pathetic 
war of magics once and for all. 

Aarin looked over at Saizaki, Lilia and Rainhande, who were still 
cautious about getting in close contact with the Neo-English sorceress 
in his arms. &quot;It is okay. You may come forward. Diana is no longer a 
threat to us.&quot;

Lilia was the first to step closer. Then Saizaki, and shortly 
afterwards, Rainhande. But Saizaki was the first to speak. &quot;...What 
now?&quot;

&quot;Now we end this ridiculous war,&quot; Aarin replied sternly, holding Diana 
in his arms. &quot;Al Gul Jehed&#39;s ambition will lay waste to what is left of 
the earth. If we do not stop him, even more people could suffer the same 
fate as Diana. One last fight to the death. With Al Gul. Once we stop 
him, we will find a way to end this world&#39;s aggression. Without 
resorting to combat.&quot;

Rainhande nodded in agreement. &quot;Then we must travel to the Ruins of 
London immediately. We can waste no more time than we have.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s gonna be hard getting there though,&quot; Saizaki added. &quot;I mean we 
still don&#39;t know exactly where Al Gul Jehed is.&quot;

Diana finally pulled her face from Aarin&#39;s shoulder. &quot;...I...do...&quot;

&quot;Really, Diana?&quot; Lilia asked timidly. &quot;You&#39;ll help us?&quot;

&quot;...If it means ending the war...&quot;

Saizaki still didn&#39;t like her much, but, &quot;Then can you tell us where he 
is?&quot;

Diana bobbed her head. &quot;Yes I can... but I can do better than show you.&quot;  

The Neo-Englishwoman peeled herself from Aarin, then stood in the middle 
of the four other warriors. She spread out her arms and closed her eyes, 
calling upon her powerful magics once more. A wind picked up around the 
three of them and it surrounded them in a cluster, covered in streaks of 
lightning. Seconds later, all five of them were gone. Leaving behind the 
quiet forest covered in blankets of snow. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Prasutagus Manor, Greenwashe, Cath Maige Tuired

&quot;Ugh...&quot;

Rhiannon groaned tiredly as her eyelids began to flutter open. The first 
thing she felt was a throbbing pain in her skull. She held a hand to her 
head and tried to shake it off. Which was when she felt the plaster that 
was there. Rhiannon opened her eyes fully and looked around. She was 
lying in someone&#39;s bed, in someone&#39;s bedroom. Which was where she began 
to realize that this was her own room. The room she had been allowed to 
sleep in at Prasutagus Manor during her stay. The girl tried to think 
back to how she got here. But she couldn&#39;t at all remember how. All she 
could recall was seeing Gram charge at her with his sword. Then she saw 
nothing but stars. 

But with the memory of that defeat came all the sadness that went along 
with it.  The idea that she had been beaten was hard enough to swallow. 
But that monster had wiped out her whole platoon. All twenty-five of her 
troops were gone now. How was it that she still lived? What of Bonnie? 
Was she okay? And there was always the Quetzacoatl to think of. Did Gram 
and Ursula get their hands on that too? Or was Leignitz enough to 
prevent that?

Rhiannon pulled her upper body upwards from the bed and tried to cool 
down all of the many thoughts that were racing around in her head. She 
just had to take one thing at a time. She looked over at her right. On 
her table was her Order of Light tunic and her sword. She herself was 
dressed in a set of night clothes that obviously belonged to Bonnie. 
Rhiannon just hoped that that was a good sign. Then came a knock on the 
door.

&quot;...Come in.&quot; Rhiannon ushered.

The door parted slowly and Bonnie&#39;s cute little head peered through. A 
look of disquiet turned into one of joy when she saw Rhiannon in bed. 
She was all bruised and bandaged-up but Bonnie was just so glad to see 
her alive. The blonde strode up to the bed and took a seat on the edge 
of it, playfully kicking her legs. 

&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Bonnie enquired.

Rhiannon held her head again. &quot;Not great to be honest with you. But I&#39;m 
not so concerned with myself. I want to know what happened to you after 
I was knocked unconscious. Are you okay? Did Gram hurt you?&quot;

Bonnie shook her head. &quot;No. After you... were hurt, Leignitz tried to 
stop  Gram from taking the Quetzacoatl. Then that child, Ursula 
appeared. She defeated Leignitz and spared me for some reason. Then they 
took the Quetzacoatl and vanished.&quot;

&quot;Dammit!&quot; Rhiannon cursed, &quot;I screwed up. They got the Quetzacoatl after 
all. And now my whole squad is dead. All for a stupid quarterstaff. What 
makes that thing so damn special, anyway?&quot;

Bonnie cast her gaze back downwards. &quot;I am... so sorry for your loss. I 
didn&#39;t know everyone all that long... but they all seemed like a really 
nice bunch. Not one of them hated or scorned me for being what I am. A 
magic-user. For that I am grateful. I just wish that I could do 
something to make this easier on you.&quot;

The battered Rhiannon pulled a smile as best as she could and gently 
stroked the soft cheek of her girl. &quot;Don&#39;t feel like that. I&#39;m at least 
happy that you got out of all that alive. I never got the chance to make 
eyes at that Ursula kid... but I&#39;m thankful that you&#39;re okay.&quot;

&quot;So what are you going to do now?&quot;

&quot;...I can think of one thing,&quot; Rhiannon said, ambling out of bed, &quot;I 
need a little chat with someone about this whole situation.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral, Ruins of London, Neo-England

The stone path leading up St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral. Stone blocks dropped in 
front of a stairway to one of God&#39;s holiest temples. Corrupted by the 
decaying fingers of Al Gul Jehed. This place had already been radically 
changed. The place was now a symbol for the greed of a usurper, a man 
willing to cast the world into hell to fulfil his own egotistical 
desires.  

A stormy wind blew through the stone path leading towards the Cathedral. 
Once this wind vanished it was replaced with five people; Diana, Aarin, 
Saizaki, Lilia and Rainhande. 

They all touched solid ground once more. And their eyes dared to look 
around them. A city, perpetually covered in snow. A place filled with 
ruined buildings, decaying statues, mangled corpses and filth. The 
pestilence of rats and lice were common as it would have been for people 
in the 1800&#39;s.  It was a place of anguish and desolation. The few people 
that remained here gnawed upon the fragile things of London that made it 
a worthwhile place to live. Sinking into pleasures they might have 
thought better of years ago. The men scrounged in furrowed heaps of 
rubbish and human waste for scraps of food, while the woman sold 
themselves to the perverted with little compassion for their own bodies. 
Children bickered over the simplest things, seeking to alleviate their 
unhappiness by arguing them away. 

But this was understandable. The Ruins of London, though inside the 
Neo-English Safe Zone, was the only city that did not see any revival. 
People were doubtful that it would work. The Ruins of London were so 
damaged and battered that no one dared to hope it could be saved. So it 
stayed as it was, its only use; a reflection of what life was like 
outside of the Safe Zones, to scare Safe Zone dwellers into conformity. 
Even now, there were less than 300 people living in this defiled hole, a 
mere shadow of its former superiority. 

Saizaki, Lilia and Rainhande were all shocked at how austere this place 
seemed. But Diana and Aarin knew that it was far beyond saving. Before 
the group was St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral, the current &#39;palace&#39; of Al Gul 
Jehed. This was were he planned on controlling the earth. This would be 
the hub of his plans. Diana looked on at the place.

&quot;This is where he is,&quot; She began. &quot;Al Gul has made St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral 
his base of operations. But he lives here by himself. There are no 
troops inside. Only him alone. If you enter this place, you will find 
him. In the Great Hall.&quot;

Saizaki grinned. &quot;Okay then! Let&#39;s take this guy out!&quot; 

Both Rainhande and Lilia nodded to Saizaki, then followed him as he 
passed through the gate and ran up the steps towards the main door. They 
went in quickly, leaving nothing to time. There was a mission to 
complete. Just then, as Aarin was about to follow, when he noticed that 
Diana was fixed in her place. He looked back at her, his sage-like brown 
eyes tinted with concern.

&quot;Will you not come with us?&quot; He asked.

Diana shook her head as a no. &quot;I cannot. Al Gul Jehed is not my main 
concern right now. I have something else that I need to do first. Then I 
will tend to the matter of... him.&quot;

Aarin nodded. He understood. &quot;Accepted. And Diana... I am truly sorry 
for all the heartbreak Setsuya and I have caused you. We laid down our 
lives to stop a man who we thought would bring evil to this world. And 
though I do not believe we acted incorrectly, I am genuinely remorseful 
that we produced this agony in you.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Diana answered, &quot;I am the one... who must take responsibility for 
my mistakes. I shall not let this sadness in my heart afflict others. I 
will do as I must and acknowledge my love for Zephaniah by doing the 
right thing. That in itself should be the only thing my power must 
strive for. Farewell, Aarin Highland.&quot;

And so they parted. Diana stepped back and spread her arms open, 
allowing that transportation wind to seize her body. She cast her eyes 
over at Aarin with a tranquil glance, one that offered thanks without 
actually saying it. But was enough for Aarin. The wind grew stronger 
until it broke away, leaving nothingness in the place at which Diana 
once stood. Aarin smiled, then ran after his subordinates. He climbed 
the steps to St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral and entered, running towards the Great 
Hall at which Al Gul resided. As he ran through the elongated stone 
corridor, he noticed that his three pupils where standing ahead of him, 
and a fifth figure standing before them. At first Aarin thought that it 
might be Al Gul himself, but it was revealed that this person was a 
woman. An American woman with bright emerald hair, dressed in Chinese 
garbs, and in possession of a long metal quarterstaff which she twirled 
around her body aggressively. 

It was Lilia who carried the most hatred for her. &quot;...Esperanza!&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh...&quot; Esperanza ignored Lilia and focused on Saizaki. &quot;Hey 
there, Muffin? You miss me? I sure have missed you. I was beginning to 
think we&#39;d never get to play again.&quot;

Saizaki pointed at her. &quot;Look girl, we really don&#39;t have time for this. 
So just get out of our way and we&#39;ll say no more about it.&quot;

Esperanza continued to twirl her staff in that intimidating way. &quot;Sorry, 
Muffin. I&#39;ve got my orders. No one is allowed beyond that door over 
there. Beyond that door is a man that&#39;s gonna shape the earth. And I 
wanna be apart of that world, see? So that&#39;s why I can&#39;t let you cuties 
interfere with him.&quot;

Rainhande was the first to act provocatively, drawing Lightning Tooth 
from its scabbard. &quot;You twisted witch! You have no choice in the 
matter!&quot;

He then felt a hand on his shoulder. The hand of Aarin. &quot;No, Rainhande. 
I will handle this one. You three must go on ahead and defeat Al Gul 
Jehed.&quot;

Rainhande accepted that. This wasn&#39;t the first time Aarin would cover 
their backs. And the three needed to keep their strength for Al Gul. 
Aarin withdrew the sword from the sheath at his back, smiled casually 
and then vaulted into the air. The cut at his head, the one received 
from Diana, was actually still bleeding, but he felt no fear at all. 
What mattered now was the ending of the War of Magics. Esperanza watched 
with concern as Aarin jumped through the air towards her, repositioning 
his sword so it came down in a vertical slashing motion. Esperanza 
spread her staff horizontally and defended herself from the strike. The 
two weapons clashed with a violent echo, both fighters holding the other 
to a stand-off. Because of this, Esperanza was powerless to stop 
Rainhande, Lilia and Saizaki from running past the two of them. 

The staff-wielder was alert. &quot;No! Stop!&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Aarin forced more pressure into their weapon lock, &quot;You&#39;d be wise 
to focus on me.&quot;

The three warriors let Aarin handle that business with Esperanza, though 
Saizaki couldn&#39;t help but look back at Esperanza&#39;s predicament. 
Strangely enough, he kind of liked her. But there was no time for that. 
They had to focus completely on the mission. As Saizaki and the others 
ran up the next flight of carpeted stairs, there was one last iron door 
that was standing in the way. Saizaki took his boot to the door and 
kicked it open, the fabric of his tunic dancing around his body. They 
were in the main hall. The centre of the power of the Covenant. A hall 
that was adorned with statues of old and burnt crosses, withered draping 
over the crumbling stone walls, and a haunting feel that could chill 
even the mightiest man to the bone.

Lilia, Rainhande and Saizaki all were swallowed up the decaying images 
of what they were seeing. It was almost as if this rotting cathedral 
represented the condition of the earth. And across from them, on the 
other side of this cathedral&#39;s grand hall, was the man behind the War of 
Magics. The man who authored the theft of the Shadow Edge and feared as 
the most powerful magic user known to mankind. 

Al Gul Jehed.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Achenpass, The Bavarian Alps, Borderline Neo Germany 

Out of all the battlegrounds that had been staged in the War of Magics, 
borderline Neo-Germany had to have some of the most fierce and bloody 
ones. Soldiers for the Order of Light and the Neo World Federation were 
locked in a death duel with the soldiers following the Covenant of 
Sorcerers. Men and women; some as old as forty-nine, some as young as 
fourteen, all went into combat without caring or compassion. Only the 
will to destroy their enemies and fight for that which they believed was 
correct. People lay dead as far the eye could see across this rocky 
field. And fighting took place at ever further lengths. Blood spilt 
along the ground in pints, bodies fell from grace like leaves, and 
sounds of screams filled their ears. Screams of the dying, those in 
agony, those about to land killing blows on their targets. It was all 
the same. The same infuriating yet heartbreaking madness. Explosions 
soon rocked the battlefield. Fire and shards of soil were blown across 
those bloody ground, killing those close enough. Fresh platoons of 
magic-users marched into fray, destroying their allied rivals with 
whichever magical projectile their mind could conceive.

High above them, a lightning covered wind blew in. Diana appeared in the 
midst of it, hovering clear over the sheer destruction that was taking 
over the south of Neo-Germany. She looked down at this sight with 
regretful eyes. Not only had she been a part of this war, she was a 
willing part of it. People were dying in their hundreds and Diana had 
simply stood back and watched. Well no more. If she were ever to repent 
for her sins, then she would have start now. 

The young woman closed those expressive eyes of hers, then got to work. 
Her hands spread open at her sides, and energy began to glow around 
them. Streaks of bright white light, like a snake coiling around a dying 
mouse. This energy grew stronger as seconds went by, and a haughty but 
feminine growl escaped from Diana&#39;s throat. She struggled to maintain 
this high intensity energy, but managed to keep control over it, as she 
defiantly brought her hand upwards until they were spread out 
horizontally; from one end of her body to the other. 

&quot;I am calling on all my powers...&quot; Diana mumbled to herself. &quot;Aid me in 
quelling the sheer fierceness of this combat... this war... Critical 
Shockwave!&quot;

Diana brought her two hands together and clapped. But the sound of it 
was more like a deafening roar. From that action, a HUGE wave, clearly 
designed for large-scale battles, passed through the air. It moved 
slowly, but like an enormous vibration that warped the air as it grew 
larger in size. Eventually this vibration reached the warring soldiers 
below the Neo-English sorceress. They stood no chance of defending 
themselves against it. The armies of both factions were knocked off 
their feet and sent to their backs. Such was the force of the Critical 
Shockwave. The wave continued to pass along and knocked down each 
soldier it collided with; until it faded away. But the results had been 
the desired ones. Out of the hundreds fighting, not one soldier had been 
left standing. And, to Diana&#39;s ease, they were not getting back up. She 
was thankful. They were not injured, just stunned. This would put an end 
to all the unnecessary killing until Aarin and his group were successful 
in stopping Al Gul Jehed. 

Diana took the time to draw in breath. Pulling off techniques of that 
scale was not easy. But she had to keep it together. There were still 
more things that she needed to tie up...
