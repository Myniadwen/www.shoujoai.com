<p>“Horrors: hostile environment!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The atmosphere was unusually quiet  aboard the <em>Dauntless</em> as it flew away from the space station  and headed back into the Deep Heavens. The majority of the crew was  not concerned about where they were going so much as where they had <em>been</em>. Hallow’s Point sounded just as appealing as any other  normal hub in the galaxy, and anybody seriously looking forward to  going there was only doing so out of curiosity: they wanted to see if  the famous Wrench really was Eve’s mother. But for most people,  that didn’t matter: they had left their hearts back at that  station, and were now beginning the long journey of recovery.</p>
<p>All things considered, though, Riene  was probably the happiest with her decisions, even though a shadow of  doubt was still lurking behind her…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>After the mess left by the  terrorists was cleaned up, Director Astor awarded those directly  involved in the rescue, and personally vowed to increase military  vigilance so that further instances would be prevented. She didn’t  stay around to comment further, however, and left as silently as a  person in her position can. Riene had been one of the people Astor  personally thanked, even though she felt she didn’t contribute  much, but while she was up there receiving her accolades, she spotted  Sati Yeriman in the crowd, and made a beeline for her once the  ceremonies were over.</p>
<p>“Sati!”</p>
<p>“Who’s calling me? Oh, hey,  Riene! It’s been a long time!” Sati ran up to her and threw  herself into Riene’s arms; the redhead laughed and almost  collapsed. Her face flushed with golden-red love as Sati licked her  cheek and rubbed their noses together, and she lifted her head so she  could touch the younger woman’s soft, sweet lips.</p>
<p>“I take it you’re glad to see  me.”</p>
<p>“Very glad! Uh, here, let me help  you. Heheh, sorry about that. Sometimes I get a little carried away.”  She lifted Riene up and took a walk with her around the pavilion,  where they caught up on recent events. The last time they saw each  other, the Space Race had ended and Sati had offered to make Riene  her partner. The kindhearted linguist was flattered, but still unsure  of herself, and asked for some time so she could formulate an answer.  Although she was not completely certain yet, Riene’s feelings were  leaning very strongly towards Sati, thanks in no small part to the  events that happened between their meetings. Rebecca was just a  distant dream </p>
<p>for her now, while Sati was right  here, willing to get into a relationship. It wasn’t exactly what  Riene had envisioned, but she believed she could be happy.</p>
<p><em>Not exactly what I had  envisioned… So does that mean I had feelings for her all along?</em></p>
<p>“Wow, that’s some story,” Sati  whispered once Riene finished (naturally, she omitted the details  about her meeting with the shape-shifter). “So you really saw a  Doppelganger? That’s incredible!”</p>
<p>“I’d rather not talk about it  right now,” she said gingerly. “Tell you what: how about I take  you on a nice date, and we can try to decide what we’re going to do  about that arrangement.”</p>
<p>“It’s a little early for your  decision, isn’t it? Didn’t you say you were going to tell me once  your ship reached Gaea’s moon?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, something to that  effect, but we can still talk about it, can’t we?”</p>
<p>They did more than just talk: they  went into Riene’s room together and made love. Riene had never felt  her inhibitions drying out so quickly before, and the pounding lust  that had awoken on that foreboding world had now come to fruition,  and as soon as they slipped into her hotel room— on the pretense of  continuing their discussion in more peaceful surroundings— Riene  lost herself and attacked Sati without mercy. The half-Inu never  expected anyone as reserved, demure, and private as Riene to act  aggressively, but it was a dream come true and she didn’t care to  fight it. She had wanted her new lover to slow down and take her  time— she wanted them both to enjoy this moment— but no, Riene  was starved for affection; she was greedy, and long before they had  completely undressed, she and Sati were both shuddering with orgasmic  joy. Carefully, they climbed down from their peak, kissing and  undressing patiently, until they were naked in each other’s arms.</p>
<p>Riene had almost completely given up  on Rebecca by this point and would now focus her energies on Sati.  She could certainly be happy with the energetic lady, and at least  she was open and clear about her feelings. But oh, sex felt better  than she could ever imagine! After exhausting her reserves ravishing  the other woman, Riene laid down on her bed, spreading her arms and  legs out like a fertility goddess, and arched her head back, moaning  and singing beautifully as Sati made slow, sweet, selfless love to  her. Riene’s breasts became temples to be worshipped; her tummy,  while not as flat as Sati’s, was caressed and licked with ticklish  precision; her legs were smothered with kisses; her arms and  shoulders were rubbed until they went limp; she deeply drank from  Sati’s mouth, suckling on her tongue; she bucked and thrust as Sati  buried her lips in her vagina, but even then, she was not satisfied.</p>
<p>“There’s something I’ve always  fantasized about, Sati,” she whispered, her eyes glittering in the  sepia lighting. Her lover smiled patiently and smoothed out her  distorted hair.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Riene swallowed  and pointed to one of her parcels she had brought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You see that green bag? There’s  a…a strap-on in there, Sati. I want you to…put it on and…make  love to me.”</p>
<p>“Y…you what? Um, I mean,  seriously?” Now it was Sati’s turn to blush. She had no idea  Riene had such a wild imagination (or for that matter, a sex toy in  her possession)! And yet, gazing into those needy sapphire spheres of  hers, deep into her heart, she could see just how strong this desire  was. Riene had been wanting to cross that line for a very long time  now, but she had been so afraid of making the jump tht she had led a  rather pathetic existence. But not anymore. Sati grinned and caressed  her cheek.</p>
<p>“All right. It does sound kind of  fun. But it’s <em>your</em> turn next.” Riene giggled and reclined  like a sultana waiting for her favorite concubine. Sati had a bit of  difficulty putting the accessory around her waist, so Riene had to  reach out and give her a hand. The artificial organ was not too long  nor too hard, and Riene swallowed with anticipation as Sati modeled  it for her, standing proud with her hands on her hips. She crawled  atop her lover, straddling her as she moved the sex enhancement into  position.</p>
<p>“Ready?” she whispered. Riene  kissed her firmly.</p>
<p>“Just don’t be <em>too</em> gentle,” she glowed. Her world tenderly ripped apart as Sati  descended— first in a baptismal of pain, then in a spectacular  flourish of paradise— and she cried out, half-screaming and  half-calling out in rapturous exclamation. Sati pinched her nipples,  burrowing deeper, and Riene nearly hyperventilated. She had never  felt anything remotely close to this; it would be seared into her  heart and soul forever. She felt her virginity breaking, but she  didn’t care: this was bliss.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Riene sighed deeply and clutched her  heart, wondering if she had made the right decision. She could only  rejoice or regret: she could not go back and change anything. Deep in  her mind, she had always fantasized that Rebecca would be her first,  as no doubt Rebecca had wanted Riene to be hers— but no plan works  out perfectly, and fantasies are often dashed to pieces when  confronted with the cruel twists of reality. Rebecca had been  violated by the Doppelganger Changera, who took the form of Lyara, no  less, and Riene gave her purity away like candy, albeit to a more  reliable recipient. The distance between them was now very great,  even though they shared the same living area, merely four doors away  from each other.</p>
<p>But even so, Riene felt a still,  solemn joy, and was glad that, if she could not give herself to the  one she really wanted, she had at least shared herself with a good  person, and one she could even envision sharing a life with. Chandra,  on the other hand, was different. She was <em>still</em> reeling from  Amy’s devastating statement, and coming into contact with a  gorgeous, strong woman who nearly threw herself into Chandra’s arms  only helped to worsen her inner struggle. Even as she </p>
<p>closed her eyes, she couldn’t  focus away from that moment, nor the sensations that had bombarded  her and made her feel, for the first time in her life, vile.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“And you’re sure you’re okay?  You weren’t hurt at all?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Chandra  replied, smirking cleverly. “With a body like this, I was able to  have my way with those people. I seduced my way to safety and stayed  hidden until it was over.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like something you’d  do.” Kaori Chuunaru managed to smile, even though Chandra also  flustered her. It had been awhile since she had seen the exotic  beauty…and then there was that conversation she held with Yeriman…  “Well, I’m glad you’re safe. Oof…the same can’t be said  about me, though.”</p>
<p>“Oh, goodness, were you hurt? Let  me take a look!”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” Kaori  muttered, “just some bruises. I got kicked pretty hard in the  stomach during the confusion, but this suit saved my life. Help me  take it off, would you?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” Chandra said, her  voice trembling. As a pleasure unit made to service other women, she  could appreciate feminine beauty, and Kaori, despite her militaristic  density, was unquestionably gorgeous. Her body was quite strong and  shapely, thanks to years of hard work and dedication, and she was  tanned nicely on her legs and arms. Having Oriental features gave her  a slightly more exotic look, and while she was powerful and stern,  there was definitely something feminine (and even cute) about her.</p>
<p>The Damascus suit looked like it  would take a team of experts to disassemble, but despite how bulky  and sturdy it appeared, the trick to removing it was really simple:  Chandra merely had to unlock several clasps and release them, and the  suit rippled off like dew falling from ripe fruit. It was amazingly  light and comfortable, like silk almost, but hard enough to deflect a  point-blank blast from an explosion. But no armor is perfect; Kaori  still got a few bruises from the fight, but it would never be  anything more than that. Once the armor was removed and stored away,  Kaori sat on her bed and stiffened as Chandra lifted her shirt. There  was a very faint purple blotch on her abdomen.</p>
<p>“This looks awful,” she  whispered. “Let’s see if we can’t make it better.”</p>
<p>“That’s not necessary,” Kaori  muttered, but it was no use arguing: Chandra had already leaned in  and kissed the battle-wound. Kaori felt like her sight was stolen  away as bright lights flashed in her eyes, and they became stronger  and louder as Chandra gently lifted her shirt further, unfastening  her buttons and exposing more skin. She half-kissed, half-massaged  the wound, and </p>
<p>even though it was still tender, the  pain was completely masked by this seductress’ care. Kaori knew she  would not be able to resist Chandra’s advances; in fact, she would  welcome them. She knew that it would stir controversy, put her  character into question, and might even throw her position into  jeopardy, but oh…she didn’t care, she didn’t <em>care!</em> This  felt so good, and she would never have an opportunity like this, and  she wanted to believe in her feelings so much…</p>
<p>Her shirt came off, leaving Kaori to  stare at the pleasure unit in her plain white brassiere. Chandra’s  clothes piled around her knees as she gently laid Kaori on her back  and crouched down, trailing her lips up the ecstatic woman’s body.  This was it. It was really going to happen. Kaori stared into those  expressive green eyes for a timeless moment before pressing her mouth  against Chandra’s honeyed lips, drinking deep from a forbidden  pool.</p>
<p>“I love you,” she whispered.  Chandra smiled in spite of her mounting conflict and reached around  to unhook Kaori’s bra.</p>
<p>“I love you, too.”</p>
<p><em>But do I really love her, or is  she merely another notch in my bedpost?</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>The greatest conflict of them all  was on Mink’s conscience, strangely enough. For the first time  anybody could remember, she and her master had separated and were not  speaking to one another, and in fact, Vimmy had isolated herself in  her room the moment she came aboard, refusing to come out. Moreover,  Shana was taking a rare sabbatical from her hobbies, opting to sit  quietly and stare at the wall as she thought about what had  transpired. She only permitted Herut to approach her, and even then,  they didn’t speak. She just held her hand and felt a little better  for it.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>A discussion about the Heavens led  to heavenly confessions and caresses. The truth is, Mink told Shana  in that hushed, husky voice of hers, even though I may not look it  all the time, I actually love you very deeply, and I’ve been in  love with you for a long time. Well, how does one so inexperienced  respond to that? Shana almost felt guilty as flowery lips touched her  face, the kisses of ambrosia that gave her goosebumps and melted her  resolve. Honestly, Mink, I’ve fallen </p>
<p>in love with you as well, but I have  so many problems. My brother is dying. I have no idea what I’m  doing. I think I’m in love with Herut as well. I’m so  inexperienced.</p>
<p>She found no easy answer in Mink’s  arms, only love and tenderness, but she could be happy, even if she  believed she was acting selfishly. Soon the petite angel was naked  and straddling Mink’s body, a soft marble pillar that glowed with  unconditional love. Mink was so much taller and prettier, and yet she  yearned for Shana, because she had fallen in love with her artist’s  soul. She was inexperienced with this form of love as well— how  awkwardly she took off Shana’s clothes, and how sweetly she smiled  and beheld the nude cherubim!— but she had been storing these  feelings in her heart for weeks, and now they had finally burst out.  It was no stretch to say their actions were beyond their control.</p>
<p>“Ach, Mink, I heard somebody  telling me they saw you come into this room, where have you been, my  dear, I’ve been looking all over f— ”</p>
<p>And in that instant, everything was  ruined. Vimmy stood at the doorway to their bedroom, her hand still  on the knob, her mouth hanging open in mid-rant, entirely petrified  from the shock of bursting in on a tender moment. Mink and Shan froze  as well, too frightened to move or speak, and a deep, deadly silence  purveyed the room. At last the fatal hush broke as Mink stuttered,  trying to explain her actions.</p>
<p>“Uh…I…”</p>
<p>“WHATINBLAZESAREYOUDOINGMINKICAN’TBELIEVEYOU’DDOSOMETHINGLIKETHISHOWCANYOUBESOSHAMELESS…”  The rest of her words were lost in an explosive fury as Vimmy paced  around the room, flailing her arms and screaming at the top of her  lungs. Mink had never seriously feared for her life until that  moment, and she held Shana protectively, thrusting a blanket over  their bodies and waiting for her chance to retaliate. Vimmy finally  ran out of oxygen and collapsed, but not before giving the two women  a damning glare.</p>
<p>After recovering, Vimmy had a  smoldering expression in her numbed eyes, and if it were possible,  expressed more frustration by not saying anything. She simply huddled  in a chair, wrapped in a small sheet, cradling a tall glass of brandy  as Mink and Shana tried to explain their actions.</p>
<p>“We didn’t do anything wrong,  Vimmy,” Shana said. “We <em>love</em> each other. People do that  sort of thing when they’re in love. We couldn’t help it.”</p>
<p>“It’s true,” Mink murmured, no  longer so emotionally distant. “Shana has become the light in my  world. With all due respect, you knew when we met that I would not  remain your servant forever. I have to strike out on my own  eventually. That is the one goal every member of my species strives  for. We have not acted shamefully.”</p>
<p>“Besides, it’s not as if you’ve  ever considered Mink’s feelings in the past,” Shana muttered.  Vimmy stared daggers at them both.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I beg your pardon,” she  whispered harshly, “but I have <em>always</em> given Mink’s  feelings great thought in my every endeavor, how dare you suggest  otherwise, and as for you, my lady, you have most <em>certainly</em> performed shamelessly, really now, have you no remorse, allowing  yourself to be disrobed and…smothered like that, and speaking so  arrogantly, well now, so I’ve heard your true feelings, eh, you <em>do</em> mean to abandon me, right when I need you the most, and for what, for  this?” She gestured shakily at Shana and swallowed her drink in one  go. Mink stood up, towering over both master and lover, and seethed  with genuine, righteous anger. It had been the first time she was so  expressive.</p>
<p>And then, she slapped Vimmy, nearly  knocking her out of the chair.</p>
<p>“I have always respected you,”  she whispered darkly as tears formed in her eyes. “Bit I have  never, <em>ever</em> liked you. And you should knock whenever you enter  a room!” She grabbed Shana with iron fingers and whisked her away,  both of them deathly silent. But their efforts were in vein, for they  were doomed never to find a safe haven so long as they all shared the  same ship.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“You’d find happier faces on  Boot Hill,” Allegra remarked as she walked through the ship’s  corridors. She didn’t like being surrounded by gloom, but at least  her <em>own</em> life was turning out well. She and Kate now considered  themselves a “couple”, and as bizarre as it was for Allegra to  love another woman like that, she was glad she had given her heart  away. She was actually heading over to sample Kate’s cooking  progress and offer her opinion. Allegra felt she deserved to be happy  after nearly half a lifetime of misery and sorrow, and even though  she still had a few problems to overcome, at least now there was  somebody by her side who understood her feelings and would support  her. In fact, merely thinking about Kate’s warm presence and her  loving smile made Allegra a little dizzy, and…well, what’s this?  She must’ve been so overcome with excitement that she fell over!</p>
<p>No, that wasn’t it. The <em>Dauntless</em> was wheeling in pain as its hide was pierced by white-hot spears and  bolts. It bucked wildly, throwing everyone around, regardless of  their romantic ventures. The Acheron sisters raced to the bridge and  fought to keep the ship from flailing out of control; Aseria barked  that she didn’t need their help, but as the ship lurched forward,  she was flung against the controls violently, and knocked out cold.  Kay and Tee didn’t have time to regard her condition or cure her,  and nobody else would be able to make it to the bridge to help out.  The <em>Dauntless</em> fought back against her unknown foe, but it was  a useless venture: she was completely overwhelmed. The best the  Acherons could do was find a world to touch down on and protect the  safety of everyone onboard.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p></p>
<p>“That should do it. “They’ll  be out of it for a few hours, but let’s not get sloppy. Take the  ones the Professor asked for and leave the rest.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that’s a  little imprudent? I mean, I know were only taking the strong ones,  but they’re not exactly the majority. And what about the  you-know-what they have with them?”</p>
<p>“Pssh, don’t tell me you believe  that crap! And even if it were true, one of the professor’s ‘pets’  was brought in to keep it away. Here’s one of them. Damn…she’s  pretty cute!”</p>
<p>“I got another one. What does he  want with them, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Hell if I know. Some weird  scientific experiment. Oh, hey, over here. See any resemblance?”</p>
<p>“Oh my god, yeah. He’ll  certainly be happy to see <em>this</em> one! But check out the one  Hubert bagged.”</p>
<p>“Ooooh, sweet! Yeah, we’ll be  getting some big bonuses for this job! Uh— careful there, Gastri. I  think she might still be awake. Better tranq her.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Didn’t the professor say  that one of these angels was immune to his toxins?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, the, uh…rabbit one.  Yeah, just shoot her up. Two should do the trick. Be careful.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. Okay, I think  that’s the last of em’. Are you <em>sure</em> we should just leave  the others here?”</p>
<p>“That’s what he told us. They’re  not important. It’s not like they could follow us anyway. All  right, back to the truck.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Kate Shepherd woke up with an  agonizing migraine, and for once, it hadn’t been caused by her  cooking. But speaking of which, where was Allegra? And where was <em>she?</em> This room certainly wasn’t inside the <em>Dauntless</em>: it was too  dark, cold, and clammy. She had been lying on a hard, flat surface,  probably a slab of some sort, and woke up feeling sore and weary.  Although she couldn’t see very well, she was beginning to make out  shapes and movements, and could tell that she was not the only one  caught here, wherever it was.</p>
<p>“Shepherd’s up,” she heard  somebody say. It was Naja, no mistake. Judging by her voice and the  imperceptible movements of her body as she gestured, Kate estimated  Naja was about a meter away— and there were others as well. It  didn’t stink in that pit, thank goodness, so she could smell  Lyara’s Elvish fragrance, and it was so quiet that she could hear  Alala whining. She felt gentle hands dab something refreshing on her  head, and looked up to see the dim silhouette of Mink.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hello there,” she greeted  plainly. “Don’t worry, you didn’t sustain any injuries from the  crash. That’s really more than I can say about the rest of us.  You’re very tough.”</p>
<p>“But I don’t remember passing  out,” she groaned.</p>
<p>“That’s because you were gassed  the minute we touched down,” Lyara muttered.</p>
<p>“She’s exaggerating,” Naja  snorted. “Some guys in gray hazmat suits came in and fumigated the  whole fucking ship. Some of us just decided to put up a <em>fight</em> before we went down!”</p>
<p>“Futility,” Lyara sighed. Mink  slowly helped Kate sit up, and tried to answer her questions.</p>
<p>“I believe we’re in some sort of  prison. Alala’s made several attempts at escape, but I think this  is one cell even she can’t get out of. The bars are made of  crisscrossing superheated lasers, the walls are solid granite, and  the only window is a small hole that leaks in from the ceiling.”  She pointed to a golfball-shaped opening high up above, spilling a  single ray of dim light down into the prison, where it nearly faded.  Even so, the room was illuminated by it, and as Kate’s eyes  adjusted, she could see all of her companions. Athena was also there  with them, but she was still asleep.</p>
<p>“She’s been drugged,” Naja  reported, giving the Usagin a nudge. “That god-damned gas didn’t  have any effect on her, so they shot her up.”</p>
<p>“What about the others?”</p>
<p>“We’re the only ones here,”  the Elshyrin sighed.</p>
<p>“That’s not completely true,”  Lyara said as she stood up. “We have a neighbor next door. We can  talk to her through the bars, but she’s in the same position that  we’re in. Her name’s Melena Fara’dellyn; I think she’s a  model or something.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Vimmy’s had dealings with  her before,” Mink noted. It took them awhile to notice she left out  the honorary title. Kate sat up and looked around her again. Alala  was grumbling in the corner, nursing another escape-related injury,  Athena was lying on another slab, wrapped with whatever the others  had to spare, Lyara coolly leaned against the hard wall, Naja was  crossing her arms and glowering…</p>
<p>“So has anything happened? I mean,  does anybody know what we’re doing here?”</p>
<p>“Not a clue. So just sit tight and  keep quiet.” Kate pouted, but Naja had a point. They were powerless  to do anything, so they just had to be patient and wait for their  opportunity.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Professor, the prisoners you  requested are secured. We have six from the <em>Dauntless</em> in Cell  52, one in Cells 1 and 2, and that woman from Balder in Cell 50.”</p>
<p>“Very good. That went a lot  smoother than I expected. Give the ladies in 52 a few more hours to  cool their heads, then take them to the arena. Did you bring  Professor Brignor as I instructed?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. She put up some  resistance when we told her about you. Are you sure it was wise to  reveal your identity like that?”</p>
<p>“Valti’s better off learning  right away. She has no real reason to hate me, though. We’re  colleagues, after all. Do you have the medication I asked for?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s in this case.”</p>
<p>“Excellent. Alert me when the  games have begun, will you? I’m going to retire to my room.” The  warm, invigorating breeze blowing in was stilled as the Professor  went back inside, wound around a corner, ascended a staircase, and  came to a large, richly-carved set of double doors, which he opened  without a sound. Although his private room was as opulent as an  Emperor’s, he was only interested in his newest decoration, a  six-armed woman tied to the wall by silk kerchiefs, dressed in  fragrant cloth reminiscent of ancient Arabia: a meager top meant to  expose the chest, abdomen, arms, and cleavage, and a sheer red sarong  with a broad cut that gave the legs total freedom. Valti had never  been dressed so beautifully in her life, but the rage in her eyes  might have been even lovelier.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I had to ask my  fellows to bind you so provocatively, but I had to make sure you  didn’t wreck anything or…escape. I want you here by my side,  Valti, just like back in the old days.”</p>
<p>“You’ve turned into such a  bastard, Frank,” she scowled, struggling to free her six arms from  confinement. He smiled sweetly and touched her cheek; she lashed out  and bit him, but he kept his hand there, content to wince.</p>
<p>“I am no different from you,  Valti. We have both proved ourselves to be nothing more than  monsters. However, I would like to at least make something of myself  before God decides to send down His judgment. Are you familiar with  the name of <em>Origin?</em>” Valti’s mouth dropped open, releasing  his hand, and he withdrew it politely, rubbing the indention with a  tissue. “Ah, I see you have. That will make this much less  painful.”</p>
<p>“How do you know that name? What  does it mean?” Frank smiled calmly, walked up to Valti, and put his  nose inside her cleavage, inhaling slowly. Valti trembled at his  touch, and as deeply as she despised him now, there was still that  longtime desire of hers, the desire to be with her mentor, the man  she had loved, and lost, and now found again. Frank suddenly caught  her jaw with his soft hands, and stared into her eyes fiercely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Origin refers to absolute,  all-encompassing power. Whether it is a single entity, or several  acting together, or an entire civilization, is still a mystery. I  have only heard what I have been allowed to hear. We’re not safe  from prying ears anywhere in this galaxy: Origin is everywhere. I can  tell you this much, though: it has worked its greatest designs in the  Helios system. Origin freed Sephiria from Selene’s womb and cast  the entire world into decay. Tellus was once its goal, along with  Mars and Venus, but now it has cast its eyes everywhere. I am a part  of Origin now— I serve an entity called Boole— and I’ve been  given leave to…well, continue my research without inhibitions. That  is everything I can tell you, Valti. You had best get used to staying  here. I’m afraid I’m going to have to keep you two here  indefinitely.”</p>
<p>Franklin had the look of a madman in  his eyes, but a sliver of truth seeped out even during his raving,  and Valti committed as much of it to memory as she could, even though  he horrified her. But what did he mean by “keep you two here”?</p>
<p>“Us <em>two</em>?” she said.  Franklin glanced away and stepped back, digging through his lab coat  for a keychain.</p>
<p>“Yes, you two. My child, and the  mother of my child. Rebecca’s two cells over. Her room is even  better than yours. It’s the least I can do for her after being gone  so long.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Becky,” Valti whispered  numbly. Franklin began loosening her bonds and caught her as she fell  over; she didn’t have the will to struggle anymore. “Franklin,  listen, about that…night.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, I forgot! How <em>is</em> my son, Valti? He should be…what, two or three years old by now!”</p>
<p>“I was never pregnant, Franklin,”  she announced morbidly, staring listlessly at the wall. “I’m  sorry. When you…gave me these arms, you…well, there were  some…<em>side effects</em>.”</p>
<p>“What exactly do you mean,  Professor Brignor?” he hissed hotly, clapping onto her shoulders  with his hands. Franklin had never been a powerful man, so his grip  amazed Valti.</p>
<p>“I mean…it’s impossible for me  to have children now. The chemicals you injected me with made me  barren, and they affected the tests. I…”</p>
<p>“Then what good are you to me?”  he murmured, touching her breast and waist as he whispered in her  ear. He slipped out of her grasp and walked out the back door,  leaving Valti a brittle shell of her former self. She wheeled around  to call out to him, but he had already shut the door on her.</p>

<p>Rebecca Hill was ready for anything  when the door to her elaborate room opened up— anything, that is,  except for the handsome, warm-faced, middle-aged man that came  through. He shut the door carefully and politely approached her,  keeping his distance as she reared up, ready to fight her way  through. He was fairly tall, but he didn’t have a strong build or  an intimidating look, and his face was very pleasant to look at; it  emulated the concept of masculine beauty well. Blonde, bright-eyes,  and well-groomed, the man exuded a lovely presence, but there was  something familiar about him, some resemblance to another man that  Rebecca had known or seen before. But who, and where…</p>
<p>“So you don’t recognize me,”  he sighed, rubbing his eyes wearily. “I can’t say I’m  surprised. I’ve been gone from your life for so long that any  picture you might have kept in your mind must be fuzzy by now. I have  no excuse for that; I was merely needed elsewhere. Making up for lost  time might be futile, my dear, but at least permit me to try.”</p>
<p>“You mean,” she whispered,  gasping as the realization came to her, “are you my…father?”</p>
<p>“At your service,” he bowed,  “for what it’s worth. What’s the matter, don’t you believe  me? You had that hair when you were born, Becky. The doctors called  it an unnatural genetic anomaly. Even so, you were like a beautiful  angel from the beginning. Are you experiencing any side effects from  the toxins my fellows sprayed?” Rebecca was so overwhelmed with  what was happening that she actually did faint on her bed. Franklin  sat down and gently ran his fingers through her ivory hair, producing  a thin canister from his coat pocket. Inside was a single syringe,  along with standard equipment for injection.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the brutal manner  in which you were brought here,” he stated as he rolled Rebecca’s  sleeve back and rubbed alcohol on her arm. “My fellows have been  tracking your ship since the Space Race; we were looking forward to  your arrival. There— hold still and breathe slowly. This will help  clear your head. You’re in a citadel I’m leasing from my  beneficiaries— dramatic, I know— and for the time being, I  recommend you stay indoors. You’re free to wander around…” At  this point, he gave her the keychain he had drawn out of his pocket  earlier, adding, “And if you ring that bell over there, you can ask  my assistant for anything you desire. All right, I’m finished.”  Franklin looked down at his weary daughter, smiled lovingly, and  touched her face.</p>
<p>“You’ve grown up so much while I  was gone. Hopefully now we can be a family. I have business to attend  to, so I’ll leave you here for a few hours, but I’ll return as  soon as I can.”</p>
<p>He bent down to kiss her forehead.  She was unresponsive.</p>
<p>Before he left her room, however,  she finally sat up and spoke to him.</p>
<p>“Uh, dad…”</p>
<p>“Please don’t ask me any  questions today, Becky,” he muttered sharply. “You’d be better  off not knowing.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>The injection he gave her must’ve  been effective: she no longer felt dizzy, and in fact, her head was  clearer and more focused than it had ever been. She felt stifled, so  she went to find a drink, all the while under the careful observation  of hidden recorders. Franklin Hill checked his monitors before  returning to his studies, paying special care to his daughter’s  readout.</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Kate: Silly Franklin, didn’t he  read the last chapter?</p>
<p>Alala: Obviously not, cuz’ if he  did, he’d know what happens to people who come between lesbians and  their sex!!</p>
<p>Lyara: I didn’t think you were <em>having</em> sex.</p>
<p>Alala: Ut! I…I’m not! I’m just  saying that for those of us who ARE…</p>
<p>Mink: (eerily quiet— um, more so  than usual, I mean)</p>
<p>Lyara: Don’t look at me. Sharyn  and I only just kissed.</p>
<p>Kate: Well, <em>somebody’s </em>having  sex, and because they are, our lesbian wrath shall smite them…WITH  A VENGEANCE!!</p>
<p>Alala: Smiting is good.</p>
<p>Lyara: I’m afraid we’ll have to  do more than just smite in the next chapter. I think our captors are  going to force us into a cage match with some deadly creatures.</p>
<p>Alala: But we get a super-cool ally  as well, don’t we? There’s more to the supermodel Melena  Fara’dellyn besides looks!</p>
<p>Mink: Regardless, we had better be  careful. “Horrors: gladiators of doom” will put all of us to the  test.</p>
