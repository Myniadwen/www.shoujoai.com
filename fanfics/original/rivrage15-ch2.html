(Tokyo Nerima district, Japan June 25th 2009 11 days ago)

&quot;Who&#133; Who are you?&quot;

&quot;Me?  I am Ayane.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t underestimate you during the next duel for control.  Do 
you got that?  I won&#39;t lose to you again!&quot;

&quot;There is no way you could ever beat me.  Not in the condition 
I&#39;m in.&quot;

&quot;What are you babbling about?&quot;

&quot;I mean, lose the love of your life, then you might become as 
strong as me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re wrong.  Pride is everything.&quot;

&quot;That may be true, but love doubles that power pride gives you.  
And &#39;lost love&#39; increases it ten-full.&quot;

Rumiko woke up in a cold sweat.  Her left leg felt like it was 
on fire.

&quot;It&#39;s not really there, it&#39;s just in your mind.&quot;  Rumiko 
whispered to herself.

She had lost her left leg in an accident a few years ago.  Ever 
since then there were times she got the illusion she could feel her 
leg.  Rumiko&#39;s leg had been severed just 10 cm above the knee.

Rumiko didn&#39;t feel like putting on her prosthetic leg, so she 
grabbed her crutch and got up.

Rumiko stepped outside and breathed in the night&#39;s warm air.  It 
was very breezy and felt great as the wind cooled the cold sweat off 
of her body.

Rumiko is a direct descendent of the legendary hero Susanoou.  
The shrine she lived at is the place of his final resting place and 
also the dojo of the Tsukane Martial arts style.  It also passes down 
from generation to generation an incredibly hidden and secret form 
known as Shadow Tsukane.

Rumiko started thinking about Martial arts tournaments.  So far, 
every tournament she tried to enter refused her application.  They 
told her she would have to enter a disabled tournament or the Special 
Olympics.  Rumiko couldn&#39;t accept that.

After she finished high school her father brought her back home.  
Rumiko&#39;s father Shenna-maru told her she could still inherit the 
shrine but there would be conditions.

The first was Rumiko had to start teaching classes of Tsukane.  
The second was she had to take her little brother as her apprentice in 
Shadow Tsukane.

Normally these types of responsibilities wouldn&#39;t be put on to 
Rumiko until Shenamaru got to old to do them.  The problem was he had 
dislocated disks in his back.  The surgery put him out of death&#39;s 
reach, but as a result Shenamaru now has severe back pain that will 
last for the rest of his life.

Her little brother was six years old when she returned home and 
Rumiko hadn&#39;t seen him since he was only two.  This caused problems.  
Her little brother Ren didn&#39;t remember Rumiko very well.  Ren was 
arrogant to her, saying things such as &quot;Why am I being taught by a 
cripple?  Even I could beat her.&quot;

Shenamaru then told Ren, &quot;Ok son.  If you can beat your sister 
than I will train you myself.&quot;

Rumiko made on rule before the fight began, whoever lost their 
footing first would lose.  She then proceeded to take off her 
prosthetic leg.  Rumiko wanted to add insult to injury.

The fight lasted for hours and went into the night.  The entire 
time Rumiko just smacked Ren away.  She wanted to make sure when he 
finally did lose he would think twice about talking rudely to her.  
Finally Ren went into a all or nothing charge.  Rumiko easily jumped 
out of the way and Ren collapsed from exhaustion.

It has been two years since then.  2 &frac12; from the time she lost 
the leg.  Six days ago, Ren finally landed a punch on Rumiko.  It was 
a surprise to her yet she didn&#39;t even blink.

All of a sudden Rumiko&#39;s crutch broke in two and she came 
tumbling down to the ground.


(Across town at that very same moment, Ayane lost a fight for 
the first time to someone other than Rinako Ikatsuji)


Rumiko started to get back up, but slipped and fell face first 
into the dirt.

&quot;Damn you Ayane!&quot;  She screamed as she picked up a rock and 
threw it as hard as possible.

The rock went right through the door of the &quot;Forbidden Shrine of 
Tsukane.&quot;  The doors were made out of wood and have been rotting for 
over 50 years.  Rumiko had tried to break the lock on it many times, 
but it had been far to rusted.  No one has been in the shrine for over 
100 years according to her father.  The idea of going in was far too 
tempting for Rumiko.  If she didn&#39;t do it now, Shenamaru would see it 
tomorrow and fix it.

Rumiko got up and hopped over to the shrine.  She tore the 
broken door down piece by piece until she could fit through.  The 
small room was incredibly dusty and dark.  Rumiko could see a little 
from the moonlight.

Rumiko had asked her father once what was in the forbidden 
shrine.  All he responded with was, &quot;It is supposed to hold some 
mystic seals and spells.  There&#39;s also supposed to be some scrolls 
with forbidden Tsukane techniques within it&#39;s walls.&quot;

Rumiko asked why the techniques were forbidden and if he himself 
had ever been tempted to go inside.  &quot;Of course I&#39;ve been tempted, but 
they are called forbidden techniques for a reason.  A technique is 
usually forbidden when it doesn&#39;t just harm your opponent but yourself 
as well.&quot;

Just then a cloud moved letting the moon light shine on a object 
at the end of the shrine.  Rumiko could barely make out what it was.  
The object was a medium sized snake statue.  She hobbled over to get a 
better look.  The snake statue was beautifully painted green, with 
what seemed to be real rubies for eyes.  There was also a diamond-
shaped emerald on it&#39;s forehead.

&quot;My, aren&#39;t you beautiful?&quot;  Rumiko whispered.

&quot;And you as equally.&quot;  The statue hissed back with out moving.

Rumiko was scared out of her wits.  For once the idea of locking 
up the shrine and never coming back seemed very appealing.

&quot;There is no need to be alarmed my dear, I cannot hurt you.&quot;

&quot;How could I possibly believe you?&quot;  Rumiko asked.

&quot;Your really can not believe me, but from spending so much time 
with you humans and battling other demons, it has made me more honest.  
Although there are ways of being deceitful through telling the truth.&quot;

&quot;You said you battled &#39;other&#39; demons.  Does that make you a 
demon?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;  The statue hissed.

&quot;Exactly who are you?  I have never even heard of you.&quot;

&quot;I am hurt that you have not heard of me.  My name is Yamato No 
Orochi.&quot;

Rumiko&#39;s eyes widened.  &quot;That can&#39;t be!  Susanoou killed you!&quot;

&quot;More or less to the point.&quot;  Yamato responded.  &quot;He slain my 
physical body, but I survived to end up fighting Aerolust.&quot;

&quot;Aerolust?&quot;  Rumiko asked in a incredibly innocent voice.

&quot;Unlike me, Aerolust started out life without a body.  Because 
of this, I don&#39;t refer to it as male unlike many others.  It is pure 
energy.  It&#39;s power is amplified depending on the strength of it&#39;s 
host.  My life was spared, in return I had to help fight against it.  
I merged with a human body just like Aerolust, except instead of 
having full control over my host, we had a shared existence.  Since my 
first experience as a mortal was a in a males body, refer to me as a 
male.&quot;

&quot;Did you destroy him?&quot;  Rumiko asked.

&quot;No, but I did not lose either.  It was sealed within a statue 
just as I.  As it&#39;s name suggests, it exploits one&#39;s lusts.  I had a 
lust for it&#39;s power, so that damned Phoenix sealed me back up.

&quot;You should watch out though.  Recently Aerolust was released 
from it&#39;s statue prison.  I can feel that it has already found a 
strong host.  I can sense Aerolust&#39;s being getting stronger.&quot;

&quot;Did you end up getting any of his power?&quot;

&quot;A little.  In ways I am already like Aerolust.  For example, 
you have a lust for your leg back.  Aerolust could bring it back, but 
so could I.&quot;

Rumiko knew this could be a trap, but she didn&#39;t care.  Yamato 
No Orochi could actually be trying to kill her, but she had nothing to 
live for without her leg.  Rumiko was too far in the darkness to see 
her decision clearly for what it was.

&quot;What do I have to do?&quot;  Rumiko asked.

&quot;Tear the jewel from my head and tighten your fist upon it.&quot;

Rumiko put her hand over the statue&#39;s head and dug her nails 
under the stone.  She wiggled it to try and get it free.  The emerald 
finally popped out after a few tries.

Rumiko clutched the stone in her left hand.  She could feel a 
cold-heat building in it.  Rumiko&#39;s entire left arm then went numb.  
She felt like she was falling over to the left.  That was impossible, 
for now she had two legs.  Rumiko looked down in shock.  Her leg was 
no longer gone.  The new leg was tattooed with black lines all over 
the area where the leg had been missing.  It seemed like a dream come 
true.

Rumiko&#39;s body started to move on it&#39;s own and walked out into 
the night.  She tried to speak, but the words wouldn&#39;t come out.  The 
vision in her left eye blacked out and she could only see out of the 
right.

A light came on in the house and Shenamaru came running to the 
open door.  He was in a sleeveless shirt and pajama bottoms.  His jet-
black hair went down 5cm bellow his shoulders and was parted right 
down the middle.  As a result of his constant working out for training 
he look only about 25 years old when he was actually 35.

&quot;No!&quot;  He said flabbergasted.

&quot;You are too late.&quot;  A more dark and menacing sounding Rumiko 
replied.

Shenamaru took a good look at his daughter.  Her left leg had 
regenerated but its skin color was pure black.  So were her left arm 
and the left side of her face.  It wasn&#39;t in a straight line though, 
the edge of the black color waved down her face.  Last but not least 
Rumiko&#39;s left eye had changed.  It was now slit like a snake&#39;s eye and 
changed color from hazel to a sickly yellow.  The white of her eye had 
also changed as black as her skin giving Rumiko a completely demonic 
look.

&quot;Oh, Rumiko.&quot;  Shenamaru whispered.  &quot;You never really 
understood it did you.  The vicious cycle of vengeance you got 
yourself sucked into.  You are chasing after Ayane and Ren is chasing 
after you.  Please forgive me for not helping you.  I wanted you to 
experience this part of life for yourself and get over by yourself as 
well.  I&#39;m so foolish, but I can still save you yet.&quot;

&quot;Your too late.  Her body is mine.  She gave it up willingly.  
Now I will destroy the bloodline of my condemner with one of his own 
descendents.  I also have your martial arts style as well.  When we 
merged I gained all of Rumiko&#39;s memories and she gained all of mine.&quot;  
Yamato No Orochi lowered her (his) head.  &quot;Now, the time for talk is 
almost over.  There is just one more thing I have to say.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;  Asked Shenamaru as he took a defensive stance.

Yamato raised her head with a smirk on her face.  &quot;The wind 
blows softly,

The earth slowly starts to rise,

And steal burns like fire.&quot;
