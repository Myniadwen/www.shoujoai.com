Unbelievable Reality

Kim struggled with a scream caught in her throat, images of the undying 
demonic May hovered before her eyes and she clenched at the sheets 
tossing and turning as she tried to fight off the nightmares. She 
startled awake drenched in a damp sweat. Her eyes darted around to find 
herself in the middle of a large room filled with many other beds 
similar to the one she sat upon, all small and covered in white sheets. 
There was a line of long tall windows above each bed and she would see a 
multitude of trees outside and the early morning sun shone through their 
leaves. Next to her bed, sitting in a hard backed chair, slept Natalie 
in a black t-shirt and jeans. Kim rubbed her eyes in disbelief. 

&quot;Na... Natalie???&quot; She whispered, almost afraid that if she were to 
awaken the girl the dream would end. 

&quot;Unnn...?&quot; Natalie&#39;s eyes opened a crack and peered around. They snapped 
opened the moment they fell on the red head&#39;s face, &quot;Kimberly?!? You&#39;re 
awake!!!&quot; Natalie sat upright. 

&quot;It really is you this time.&quot; Kim continued to stare at her friend in 
astonishment, &quot;I mean... I&#39;m not dreaming again, am I?&quot; She stammered.

&quot;No,&quot; Natalie leaned closer to the girl, &quot;This is no longer a dream.&quot; 
She gave the girl a small smile.

Tears formed in the corners of Kim&#39;s eyes, &quot;I can&#39;t believe it is really 
you.&quot; She shakily reached out a hand and touched Natalie&#39;s cheek then 
noticed a dark bruise under the girl&#39;s eye. Question began to form in 
her head only to be swept away as Natalie suddenly taking her hand in 
her&#39;s. 

&quot;I told you. No more dreams.&quot; Natalie squeezed Kim&#39;s hand tightly.

&quot;OH Natalie!!!&quot; Kim suddenly jumped forward and wrapped her arms around 
the girl, &quot;I&#39;ve missed you so much.&quot;  She hugged Natalie so hard that 
she nearly fell out of the bed. 

&quot;Wah there girl.&quot; Natalie caught Kim and helped her back into the bed, 
&quot;You have to be careful.&quot; 

&quot;Is Jenn here?&quot; Kim glanced around so excitedly that she ignored her 
friends concerns. Her eyes fell on Jenn sleeping soundly in the bed 
across from her, &quot;Jenn!!! Is she alright?&quot; She jumped to her feet and 
was about to run the other side of the bed when Natalie tightened her 
grip on her hand.

&quot;I would like to ask that same question to you.&quot; Natalie pulled Kim back 
to her, turned her around and looked her in the eye, &quot;What about you?&quot; 
Her voice was calm, yet held an edge nevertheless, &quot;How are you 
feeling?&quot;  

Kimberly forced herself to smile, &quot;I&#39;m fine. Really!&quot;

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Natalie set her blue eyes on Kimberly&#39;s. 

Kim felt nervous under Natalie&#39;s penetrating gaze. Those where not the 
same eyes she remembered, &quot;Uhhh.. Of course...&quot; She stammered, nervously 
pulling on her nightgown and was surprised to find she was now in a 
hospital gown. 

Natalie stood up from the chair and pulled the girl closer so they were 
almost nose-to-nose and stared the girl in the eyes. Kim noticed that 
although Natalie was younger her eyes showed that she had grown a lot 
since they last met, &quot;Don&#39;t lie to me Kim. You were never good at it so 
don&#39;t even try.&quot; Natalie said coldly. 

Kim&#39;s fake smile quivered, &quot;I&#39;m perfect! Couldn&#39;t be be-&quot; before she 
could finish her sentence Natalie grabbed Kim&#39;s gown and pulled it over 
the girl&#39;s head, &quot;Eeep!&quot; Kimberly wrapped her arms around her body to 
cover her bandaged chest. Blood could be seen seeping through the damp 
wrappings near her shoulder, along with the numerous bruises, cuts and 
blood that covered her arms, legs and stomach.

Natalie blinked for a moment in disbelief, trembling as she tried to 
keep herself calm, &quot;LOOK AT YOU!!&quot; Anger could be heard in her voice, 
&quot;Here you&#39;re worried about your friend, and you&#39;re worse off than she 
is. Black eye, cut, bruised... and... and THIS!&quot; She gestured at 
Kimberly&#39;s bandages. 

Kimberly cringed at the sound of Natalie&#39;s voice &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; her 
voice came out in a quivering whispered. 

Natalie watched as the girl began to shake and Nat closed her eyes, 
forcing her anger away. She could no more blame Kim anymore then she 
could blame herself for not being there for the girl. She opened her 
eyes and let out a sigh. She watched the redhead she had searched for 
trembling with fear. Nat placed a hand under the her friend&#39;s chin, 
raising it so the redhead would have to look her in the eyes, &quot;Listen.&quot; 
Kim pulled away only to have Natalie take a firmer grip on her chin, 
forcing Kim to look at her, &quot;Look at me!&quot; Natalie snapped, scaring the 
girl so badly that she had to respond to the command, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
yelled,&quot; Nat said softly, &quot;I was just so worried about you,&quot; She wiped 
one for the tears off the girl&#39;s cheek with her other hand, &quot;Please 
don&#39;t cry.&quot;

Kimberly wiped at her tears with the back of her hands, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... 
I...&quot; she said between sniffles.

&quot;No, I should be apologizing,&quot; Natalie said softly, as she hugged Kim 
closely to her body. 

&quot;Now isn&#39;t this a touching sight.&quot; A voice said from the other side of 
the room. The girls turned to see a short young girl, in her early teens 
that the very least, with very short, scruffy black hair and a white lab 
coat that was a little to big for her approached the girls, &quot;Now Nat, 
you know to keep things PG in the clinic.&quot; She said with a sly grin.

Natalie blushed and handed Kim her gown, &quot;It is nothing like that, Amy&quot; 
She protested, &quot;I was just checking her wounds.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m the specialist so it will be my place to say.&quot; She eyed Kim 
as the girl frantically tried to pull on the gown, &quot;You will not be 
needing that.&quot; Her grin broadened.

Embarrassed, Kim stopped with her head and one arm in the nightgown, &quot;I 
won&#39;t?&quot; She inquired in confusion, and embarrassment. The girl could not 
have been over sixteen years old. How could she possibly be a specialist 
in anything, Kim thought. Kim glanced at Natalie in search of some kind 
of answer only to get a shrug from the girl and nervously Kim again 
removed the gown. 

&quot;Good now come sit down.&quot; Amy requested patting on the bed. Kim did as 
she was told and sat as still as possible as Amy examined the girl, &quot;I&#39;m 
guessing you think it is weird for someone my age to be looking you 
over, am I right?&quot; She asked while pulling a pen light from her pocket. 

&quot;Sort of....&quot; Kim admitted tensely, her eyes darting from the girl to 
Natalie. 

&quot;They decided it would be best if the girl&#39;s here were taken care of by 
someone similar to them.&quot; Amy said while shining the light in Kim&#39;s eye, 
&quot;and I am qualified. My parents had me studying a lot of medical 
information while I was in school. Guess they wanted me to become a 
doctor.&quot; She shut off the light and shrugged.

&quot;Are your parents here?&quot; Kim asked curiously.

&quot;No, I&#39;m alone like the rest of you.&quot; Amy admitted nonchalantly.

&quot;Alone?&quot; Kim blinked, &quot;Everyone here is alone?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Natalie said, gazing out a window, &quot;Pretty much everyone at the 
academy is on their own.&quot;

&quot;Enough about us, &#147;Amy pulled a small note pad from her pocket, &quot;Can you 
tell us how you got those bruises?&quot; She asked cautiously. 

Kim wrapped her arms around her stomach and looked down at the ground, 
&quot;I...&quot; She rubbed the side of her head with the palm of her hand, &quot;I 
can&#39;t remember.&quot; 

Amy set her hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; She gave Kim a 
warm smile, &quot;Most of us here have missing memories.&quot; She stood up, 
&quot;Listen, I need to take some blood and replace those damp bandaged, but 
afterwards why don&#39;t you and Natalie go out for a bite to eat at the 
mall. How does that sound?&quot;

&quot;Sounds good to me.&quot; Natalie smiled, &quot;We can also get you a nice dress 
too.&quot; Kim slowly nodded. She didn&#39;t know what to think anymore.
