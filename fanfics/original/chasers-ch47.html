<a href="../original/chasers-ch46.html">Back to Part 46</a><pre>&quot;So, how did taking charge of the police station
during the blackout make you feel?&quot; Dr. Alexis Jameson
asked curiously, the black haired woman pushing up her
glasses casually as she looked over her patient.

&quot;Uncomfortable,&quot; Kate Williams answered shortly, the
rangy looking sandy blonde woman sitting in the chair
opposite her.

&quot;How so?&quot; Alexis smiled slightly. Dealing with Kate
was always a challenge, the quiet police officer
giving up details only with effort. Still, it was
often rewarding work.

Kate grimaced slightly. &quot;I don&#39;t like being in
charge,&quot; she admitted after a moment, &quot;I don&#39;t like
the thought of people relying on me that way.&quot;

Alexis felt a flash of eagerness, &quot;And why is that?&quot;

Kate scowled, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Alexis pretended to make a note on the data pad in her
lap, in fact just using the gesture to buy herself a
bit of time. &quot;Who leads when you&#39;re out with another
officer in the field?&quot; she asked her curiously.

Kate seemed relieved at the change of topic, &quot;Usually
whoever is the senior officer, either by rank or by
seniority.&quot;

&quot;So if you were working with Gwen she would be in
charge,&quot; Alexis noted, &quot;and when you&#39;re out with Beth,
Jen or your new officer, Jesse, you&#39;re in charge.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Kate agreed.

&quot;And you feel uncomfortable being the one in charge?&quot;
Alexis lead Kate back around to her original point.

Kate rolled her eyes as she muttered, &quot;You should get
a job with the police, you&#39;d do great in questioning.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Alexis smiled, &quot;and you&#39;re trying to
change the subject again.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Kate sighed softly, looking down at her hands.
&quot;I don&#39;t... want to lead, because I don&#39;t want those
lives depending on me.&quot;

&#39;Like with her previous partner,&#39; Alexis noted
silently. Kate Williams was in many ways a remarkably
confident and capable woman, but that death had left
wounds to her psyche that she had never dealt with.

&quot;Your leadership didn&#39;t lead to her death,&quot; Alexis
gently reminded her, &quot;you did everything right and by
the book.&quot;

Kate shook her head, &quot;Maybe so, but that doesn&#39;t mean
I can protect them...&quot;

Alexis gave her a compassionate look as she gently
reminded her, &#39;They&#39;re your fellow police officers,
they really don&#39;t need for you to protect them.&quot;

Kate looked off in the distance as she considered
that. &quot;I&#39;m the lead officer,&quot; she finally said, &quot;it&#39;s
my responsibility.&quot;

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Alexis smiled, &quot;but I suspect you know
that, deep down.&quot;

&quot;Humph.&quot;

Alexis hid a smile at her cranky response. &quot;So how is
the new dynamic at the station?&quot; she asked Kate
curiously.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Kate conceded. &quot;I&#39;ll have to try breaking
officer Storm of her case of hero worship, though,&quot;
she added.

&quot;Jessica Storm?&quot; Alexis asked. As Kate nodded she
continued, &quot;That&#39;s the officer from Lowtown, whom you
advised.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s sort of blown up how much I helped her in
her head,&quot; Kate frowned.

&quot;You did offer very good advise,&quot; Alexis pointed out.
Knowing it would be futile to pursue that at this time
she continued, &quot;How are you and Naru getting along?&quot;

Kate smiled slightly as she admitted, &quot;I think we&#39;re
getting along better. She&#39;s not pushing me so much to
reunite with the family and I find it&#39;s kind of nice
having someone around who&#39;s actually related to me.&quot;

&#39;A big confession for her,&#39; Alexis noted. The death of
Kate&#39;s parents coupled with years in foster care had
left her very wary of those claiming close ties to
her, especially family. The fear of loss was a ongoing
theme in Kate&#39;s life, it seemed.

&quot;Oh look,&quot; Kate grinned, &quot;time&#39;s up for today.&quot;

Alexis rolled her eyes at Kate&#39;s tone, &quot;We could stay
a bit longer...&quot;

&quot;No no,&quot; Kate bounced to her feet from the chair, &quot;I&#39;m
sure you have so many appointments. I don&#39;t want to
hold things up.&quot;

Alexis chuckled as she watched Kate head to the door.
&quot;Kate?&quot; she gave in and asked.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Kate turned to look at her.

&quot;How is Gwen doing?&quot; Alexis asked.

Kate shrugged slightly, &quot;She&#39;s doing pretty well,
actually. She and Beth have been dating a few weeks
now.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Alexis paled a bit, then nodded. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Meanwhile, two police officers cautiously made their
way down a darkened hallway. Jessica pushed her red
hair back, feeling oddly undressed in casual clothes
rather than her uniform. &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Jen,&quot; the other officer corrected, a slight smile
teasing the blonde haired woman&#39;s lips as Jennifer
Grayson lead the way.

&quot;Jessie,&quot; she agreed. &quot;What do you think we&#39;re dealing
with?&quot;

Jen shrugged slightly, &quot;Hard to say. Beth got a report
on a android incident, but there was no follow up from
officers on the scene.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that unusual?&quot; Jessie asked.

&quot;Normally, but with everything that happened the
police are spread pretty thin,&quot; Jen said as they
carefully advanced.

Jessie grimaced, well aware of the chaos bellow the
city. There was a sound up ahead, glass breaking and
other indications of breaking property. Carefully they
advanced, using the noise as cover until they could
see what was going on.

The black haired android was one of the home models,
with a less drop dead gorgeous look than some of the
sex designs or commercial models. She stood in the
middle of the wrecked room, broken chairs and a
shredded table scattered around her.

&quot;Oh god...&quot; a blonde girl whimpered, pressing herself
up against the far wall, trying to get away from the
android.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to help...&quot; Jessie started to move only to
have Jen stop her with a firm grip on her arm.

&quot;We need a plan first,&quot; Jen cautioned, quickly
assessing the situation.

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Jessie conceded, wondering what tactic
the more experienced officer would come up with.

Jen checked off her pistol and hefted it into the
ready position, &quot;I&#39;ll distract the android, you get
the kid clear.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Jessie blinked.

&quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; Jen nodded, &quot;let&#39;s go!&quot;

With that Jen burst from cover, moving out to
deliberately make the android chase after her. With a
soft curse Jessie followed, keeping to the side and
hurrying to the crying woman. &quot;Are you all right,
miss?&quot; she asked urgently.

&quot;I think so,&quot; the blonde wept, clinging to Jessie.

Jen ran down the hall, the bezerk android chasing her.
Turning a corner she wheeled about, targeted and once
she was sure they were relatively alone aimed and
fired, punching bullets rapid fire through the thing&#39;s
midsection. The android slowed, staggered a few steps
then bonelessly collapsed.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Jessie asked as Jen dragged the
fallen machine after her.

&quot;Just great,&quot; Jen sighed, noting with some amusement
how the little blonde lady has nearly plastering her
body to Jessie&#39;s side. &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Jen smiled at the
girl.

&quot;Eh?&quot; the blonde lady suddenly realized what she was
doing and let go, blushing.

&quot;We&#39;ll need to get a statement from you, Miss,&quot; Jessie
said, looking more than a bit sheepish, &quot;could you
tell us what happened?&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t I let you handle it,&quot; Jen noted the adoring
look the lady was giving Jessie, &quot;I&#39;ll haul the
culprit out to the car.&quot;

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Jesse blushed.

The blonde looked up at Jesse, batting her eyes, &quot;My
name&#39;s Cassie Blake, it&#39;s very nice to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Jessie Storm,&quot; she introduced herself.

&quot;Storm,&quot; Cassie murmured, &quot;what a bold name.&quot;

&#39;Eeeep,&#39; Jessie whimpered as Jen walked away, humming
softly.</pre>
