<p>“…I’m  not a theologian, a chemist, a naturalist, or a physicist, so in my  total ignorance of the great laws that govern the universe I’ll  limit myself to this answer: I don’t know if other worlds are  inhabited, and since I don’t know, I’ll go there to find out!”  –quoted out of <em>From  the Earth to the Moon</em></p>
<p>“His  looks spread terror every hour; he strove oppression to control; nor  could all Hell’s united power subdue, or daunt his mighty soul.”  –from <em>Don  Quixote</em></p>
<p>“There  is no angel in Heaven who has not got his representative on Earth.  And there is no world where you could not meet a little unfallen  partner of our own black Archon, a kind of other self. That is why  there was an Italian Saturn as well as a Heavenly one, and a Cretan  Jove as well as an Olympian. It was these earthly wraiths of the high  intelligences that men met in old times when they reported that they  had seen the gods.” –from <em>That  Hideous Strength</em></p>
<p>“You  have carried your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you.  But you do not know all—you have not seen all. Let me tell you  then…that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel.  You are going to visit the land of marvels.” –from <em>Twenty  Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</em></p>
<p>In  a future yet to be, humanity has emerged from its heavenly cradle and  has spread its influence, for better or worse, into the far corners  of the galaxy. They have brought law, art, religion, science,  philosophy, agriculture, and business to the very edges of space  itself—but they have also introduced countless disasters, waste,  corruption, deception, and cruelty as well. Humanity has since  learned it is not the only intelligent species in the galaxy, and  through constant interaction, a frail coexistence has been formed  between all the known races. It is an age of contradictions, where  virtue and vice go hand in hand, where adventurers and outlaws fight  desperately to leave their mark in the world, and where a select  group of talented individuals will be put to the test.</p>
<p>This  is the story of…</p>
<p><em><u><strong>The  Voyage of the </strong></u></em><u><strong>Dauntless</strong></u></p>
<p>By  Al Kristopher</p>
<p>VOLUME  ONE: THE CREW OF THE DAUNTLESS</p>
<p>“The  Miraculous Meetings, Part One: You are cordially invited!”</p>
<p>The  fourth planet in the Mekratrig System—the one nobody in his or her  right mind could pronounce—did pretty well for itself considering  it was no longer a bustling spaceport. Back in the old days, when the  Golden Age of Space Travel had reached its zenith, Trig 4 (as it was  called) was a veritable metropolis, the center of the new movement,  where people from all over the galaxy could congregate in peace. It  had been by far the most popular hub since Helios 3, but now,  shamefully, it was on the decline. Civilization was on the move for a  new throne, having grown tired of this relic, but Trig 4 would  survive, like Helios 4 before it, because it was still in “good  condition” and it still had plenty of resources, bright minds,  conveniences, and attractions to keep it going for eons. Its  population was healthy and strong, its ethics solid, its morale  sound. People would remember Trig 4 with fondness: it was the first  world outside the ancient Helios System that housed multiple races;  it was the epitome of pioneer spirit.</p>
<p>Because  it was still a popular tourist destination (and an ideal place for  business, education, entertainment, etc.), the streets of Trig 4’s  cities were usually congested with pedestrians. Unlike other worlds  out in the galaxy, Trig 4 had very small cities, the kind a person  could walk through: someone in peak condition could walk from one  side to the other in an hour. Buses, bicycles, and the occasional  hovercraft were the only real methods of transport; the cities were  designed for strolling. All manner of shops, houses, offices, and  curious buildings squeezed the streets together, like the lining of  blood vessels that kept circulation going (a bird’s eye view would  improve the metaphor).</p>
<p>As  for the populace itself, there could hardly be a more diverse crowd.  Humankind had explored almost every kilometer of their Milky Way by  then, and they had discovered all sorts of races and species, many  very similar to their own. The alien representatives took up almost  half the planet’s population—any wandering tourist could spot up  to twenty different species any given hour of the day just by going  round the block—some, needless to say, more trustworthy than  others. An annual galactic census would show up to forty-two  different intelligent species (not including those closely related to  humans), but nobody believed this was anywhere near the actual  number: at least two different races were discovered every year.</p>
<p>Because  Trig 4s weather patterns are similar to Helios 3’s, it was an ideal  place for so many species and so many pedestrians. It was also the  perfect place to advertise a certain company or business—or in this  case, as several people gathered around a large bulletin board, a  private citizen hiring mercenaries. This was nothing new, as  freelancers had been contributing their services long before the  first primitive telescopes peered into the heavens, but what caught  everyone’s attention were the proposition, the pay, and the person  who had erected the ad. It read (and translated, in the two-hundred  known languages of the galaxy):</p>
<p><strong>WORK  FOR THE LEGENDARY </strong><u><strong>DOCTOR  MIRACLE</strong></u><strong>!!</strong></p>
<p><u><strong>TREASURES</strong></u><strong> AND </strong><u><strong>GLORY</strong></u><strong> AWAIT YOU!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>VISIT  &quot;THE DAUNTLESS&quot; ON STRATEGOS TO SIGN ON!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dr.  Miracle is seeking a number of strong, skilled, experienced, and/or  intelligent women to go on a voyage to a distant planet in search of  a grand treasure. Due to the high level of risk involved, applicants  should consider their abilities </strong><u><strong>VERY  CAREFULLY</strong></u><strong> before signing on. Dr. Miracle is an equal opportunity employer and  does not discriminate based on age (if adult), belief (religious or  ethical), race, species, sexual orientation, formal education, or  criminal record. All male applicants will instantly be referred to </strong><u><strong>Prof.  Nimrod</strong></u><strong>,  a faithful friend of the Doctor. Applications will be closed on  xx/xx/2807 so </strong><u><strong>FIRST  COME, FIRST SERVE</strong></u><strong>.  A payment of </strong><u><strong>300G</strong></u><strong> will be given upon launch and payment in full will be given upon  completion of mission. Dr. Miracle will not be held responsible for  loss of mind, life, or limb.</strong></p>
<p>A  sign like this cannot help but create an enormous buzz. There was  already a crowd gathered around it, pondering what this enigmatic  advertisement meant. Everyone there had heard of the mysterious Dr.  Miracle, but the name had only been whispered in rumors: there were  no facts determining just who this person was. There was not a soul  alive that could claim they had actually seen the secretive doctor,  or any who knew what Miracle was like; they did not even know if it  was a man or a woman, a human or some other alien species, or even a  corporeal presence (there were those who swore that Dr. Miracle was a  phantasm from “that other plane of existence”). Therefore, simply  using Miracle’s name was a sure way to attract lots of  attention…and the reward of money, treasure, and glory made the  puzzle more enticing.</p>
<p>“I  wonder why this Dr. Miracle person wants only women,” said one of  the onlookers. “You think it’s some perverted man trying to start  a harem?”</p>
<p>“More  than likely,” said another, “but at least he’s open-minded.  Look at all those disreputable traits he’s willing to overlook!”</p>
<p>“I  still say that ‘Miracle’ is just another codename used by the UCM  to trap space pirates and outlaws. You can bet <em>they’ll</em> come sniffing at the slightest mention of treasure and fame.”</p>
<p>“But  suppose it’s a real person and they’re sincerely scouting for  people.”</p>
<p>“That  makes me wonder what kind of treasure could be worth recruiting so  many unsavory people—or why this Dr. Miracle is making such a  spectacle of all this.”</p>
<p>“You  mean he might be finally revealing himself?”</p>
<p>“Could  be. Do you know anyone who’s signing up?”</p>
<p>“Nah,  all my friends’re smart! Hahaha!”</p>
<p>“Now  that you mention it, Strategos isn’t very far from here. It’s a  major hub for the public transport systems, so it’d only make sense  to ask people to go there. It’s nothing at all like Trig Four.”</p>
<p>“Where  is Trig Four’s main transport hub? Does anyone here know?”</p>
<p>“Why?  You planning on joining that den of pirates?” The onlookers turned  around to see who would be crazy enough to sign up, and got the shock  of their lives as they saw what appeared to be a gargoyle. One could  understand the similarity: this creature had long, pointy ears, like  one of the lower saurians, and there were two smoky-gray horns  sprouting from the highest place of her temples, moving in a smooth  curve along the sides of her head. There was also a long, flexible,  powerful tail to complete the monstrous image, but the creature  lacked any wings, so she was not a true gargoyle: she just resembled  one. Some species might have found her to be pretty, but these people  were clearly frightened of her, and most of them ran.</p>
<p>“Why  not join up?!” she screamed at the cowards. “I scared you all  without even trying! Gods of Maisa, are all humans like this?” She  approached the few spectators who were brave enough to stick around  and chuckled firmly. You could never say she was evil if you traveled  with her long enough: she was puckish and playful and very  happy-go-lucky. One could tell from her shining sulfuric eyes that  she was just bouncing on the inside, wary of the next possible prank  or joke, quick to make friends and quicker to annoy those friends  with her free spirit. She lived to play and played to live; chaos was  her pastime, and she always expressed her deepest love and admiration  with the most intricate tricks. She had very few friends among her  own species but had made quite a name for herself in the military,  mainly by fighting on both sides of the fence. Her voice was clear  and fresh, and she gestured frequently when she spoke.</p>
<p>“So  could any of you tell me where the main transport hub is? I’m  afraid I’ve never been to Mekratrig Four, so I’m pretty lost.”</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Yenae Gwen Marliir</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species:  High Saurian (</strong><em><strong>Lacertus  sapiens</strong></em><strong>)  (informally called “Changelings”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  Dwarf planet Maisa</strong></p>
<p><strong>Favorite  pastime: Gambling</strong></p>
<p>“Are  you seriously going to sign up with this bunch of hooligans?” said  the remaining onlookers. Yenae nodded firmly and even smiled.</p>
<p>“You  bet your life, old man. So can ya help me or what?” He turned  around and pointed south.</p>
<p>“Down  that road, go under the archway you’ll see. Take the first left you  come to and follow the signs. But I would reconsider if I were you.”</p>
<p>“Sorry,  you’ll have to do better than that. Opportunities like this don’t  come around very often. Well, see ya!” Yenae skipped off,  surprising everyone who watched her. The Saurians as a rule are not a  very perky race, and to see one bursting with life like that was  highly unusual. Yenae didn’t make it very far before she heard  someone calling after her. Being an alien in a world she had never  set foot on, she suspected that an enemy had followed her and was now  challenging her to a fight (not so unusual considering her  reputation). She palmed a throwing knife and whirled around, ready to  fend off her unwanted follower. It was just a girl, petite and  childlike, running as fast as she could and gasping for air. Judging  from her looks, she was no threat at all to Yenae, and so she put her  weapon away.</p>
<p>“Can  I help you?” she asked warily. The young girl bent over to regain  her breath, then looked up with a meek, helpless smile.</p>
<p>“I  couldn’t help but overhear you talking about going to Strategos. If  you’ll pardon the pun, it seems we’re in the same boat!”</p>
<p>“Oh?  Are you out for adventure as well, or just curious?”</p>
<p>“No,  I’m serious. I’m on a journey. I want to visit the most beautiful  worlds in this galaxy and I figured this was the best way. Do you  think I could follow you until we get to the transport hub?”</p>
<p>“I  don’t see the harm,” Yenae gestured. The girl looked very  young—she had a waifish body and a painfully cute face, the kind  that could charm a person like Yenae in no time. Her eyes were  different colors; they sparkled with interest and joy, gold and green  with life. Her plump cheeks looked good enough to squeeze, and her  voice matched her appearance well. This adorable little nymph was the  kind of girl who became excited easily, and one felt like they could  laugh very easily with her around. Her smile was already infecting  Yenae and she felt that not only could she trust this girl, but  strike a fast friendship with her. She had the pure soul of an  artist, but was sharper and more mature than she let on.</p>
<p>“So  what’s your name?”</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Shana Suing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species:  Human (Homo sapien)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  Epitaph</strong></p>
<p><strong>Favorite  food: Everything</strong></p>
<p>“I’m  Yenae. Good to meet you.”</p>
<p>“It’s  very nice to meet you too. What pretty hair you have!” Yenae  chuckled and flipped it vainly. She had a fluffy peroxide mane and  wasn’t ashamed to flaunt it; the locks glittered when she danced in  the light.</p>
<p>“You’re  not afraid of me? Don’t I terrify you?”</p>
<p>“No,”  Shana answered innocently. “I think you’re pretty. I can see it  in your eyes and your smile. So…so, um, about taking me to the  hub…”</p>
<p>“Oh,  that’s right! Well, that old guy said it was this way.” Shana  became a warm, welcome traveling companion, and Yenae hoped they  would both make Dr. Miracle’s cut. She had no doubt that  dozens—hundreds—maybe even thousands of other women had applied  to this coveted position. How would Miracle sort out the weak from  the strong? Would she discriminate based on skill, or were all those  pretty words just for show? Just how large was the <em>Dauntless</em>,  anyway? Where else had Miracle spread these advertisements? Yenae  made it a habit of hers to think about all this, since she was a  tactician by choice, but innocent little Shana just smiled and walked  beside her, not a care in the world. She kept stealing glances at her  new friend and was quick to offer a bright smile.</p>
<p>Once  they passed under the arch and into the tunnel, there were plenty of  signs to help them along the way—that old man knew what he was  talking about. Since most citizens and travelers could not afford  their own ship, many planets offered these public transportation  systems to ferry people between the planets and the star systems.  They were sort of like airplanes or trains had been in ancient times,  before space exploration became standard practice, and prices for  tickets were usually reasonable. Because the galaxy was so large,  however, most transport services made several layovers to refuel and  to allow passengers to come, go, and rest in between. It was not  uncommon for a service to make seven or eight brief stops before  arriving at its destination—most trips took between a week and a  month this way.</p>
<p>Strategos,  their destination, was quite close, and as the group of onlookers had  mentioned, it was an important hub on the galactic road. No sensible  service missed that world on their route: citizens, officers, and  outlaws alike congregated there. Miracle had wisely chosen an  excellent spot to gather all his (or her) applicants. Yenae and Shana  found an outgoing transport to Strategos easily, but since they  didn’t have permanent passes, they had to buy their tickets right  there.</p>
<p>“I’ll  cover it for both of us,” said Yenae as she dug into her purse. “I  couldn’t very well leave a cutie like you here, not if you have  such a wonderful dream.” Shana was easily impressed and her eyes  widened at least two centimeters as her new friend paid for both  fares. She didn’t know how she’d ever repay her…unless…</p>
<p>“I  can draw your portrait if you like,” she offered. “We’ll have  plenty of time on the ship—whoops, excuse me. I promise I’ll make  it special—pardon me.” There were already scores of people on the  ship, buckled in and waiting for takeoff. Shana and Yenae would be  seated together, but they were ushered to the rear since they had  bought their passes so late. Yenae let her friend have the window  seat and wrapped her tail around her waist as she sat down; Shana  reached out and played with the tip.</p>
<p>“Are  you ticklish?” she asked. Yenae smiled softly.</p>
<p>“Not  there, no. What about you?”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh,”  she blushed. “I’m ticklish <em>everywhere</em>.”  Yenae giggled warmly.</p>
<p>“Oh  really? I’ll have to remember that. Oh, what’s this?” Looking  across the aisle, Yenae spotted a vaguely familiar Red woman snoring  in her seat, the morning paper folded precariously over her chest.  Reds are creatures that resemble the human’s conception of devils  or demons, although they are not regarded as a malicious species (but  certainly a nuisance). They all have a shade of crimson skin—this  woman in particular had a reddish-orange tint—and the females have  small wings that allow them to fly, though none of the Reds have  tails or horns. Few of them are regarded with fondness, and fewer  still have earned themselves veneration. They are very intelligent  and curious about everything, but this powerful inquisitiveness has  been the demise and ruin of more than a few thousand hapless  bystanders, and so they are not well-loved. But Yenae believed she  knew this one.</p>
<p>“I’ve  seen her before,” she mused. Takeoff was going to start in a few  minutes and so she couldn’t get up and talk to the woman—and from  the sound of that snoring, she wasn’t going to wake up anytime  soon, either. But then she got a look at the paper on her torso, and  she tensed up as she noticed a striking similarity between the photo  on the front cover and the woman snoozing directly beneath it.</p>
<p>“I  knew it!” she hissed. “That woman’s one of the deadliest  arsonists around! She’s a pyromaniacal mad scientist! How the hell  did she manage to get through security?!”</p>
<p>“You  know her?” Shana asked. Yenae snorted.</p>
<p>“Only  through reputation. I hope <em>she’s</em> not coming with us!”</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Kyrie Lastgear</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species:  Pyrosian (</strong><em><strong>Rufus  pandaemonius</strong></em><strong>)  (informally called “Reds”)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  Vulcannis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Favorite  pastime: Burning things</strong></p>
<p>“But  the Lastgears are famous inventors,” Shana said defensively.  “They’ve provided materials for the United Cosmic Military ever  since its inception. Why would you think she’s a terrorist?”</p>
<p>“Famous  or not, she’s burned down more houses than a volcano. She claims  it’s all for science, though—what a nutcase! If she’s coming  with us, our trip’s screwed.”</p>
<p>“But  don’t you think Dr. Miracle might have a use for her?”</p>
<p>“This  ship is headed for Strategos, my friend,” Yenae said wistfully.  “But not everyone that’s going there is signing up for Miracle’s  voyage. I can only hope Kyrie Lastgear is just passing through.  Otherwise, we’ll be up to our necks in trouble.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Strategos  was not so close that the transport could make it all the way there  in one hop: it first had to stop in the Rennai system, a cluster of  seven planets that were infamous for the dregs that seemed to sprout  out of its cesspool. Authorities across the known galaxy had been  using that star system as a penal colony for centuries, long before  the people of Helios 3 emerged to join the cosmic union. The sixth  and fifth planets in particular were well-known for being the worst  of the worst—and the citizens proudly made sure the rest of the  worlds knew it. With number six housing a population of lunatics and  number five sporting the moniker of “the butt of the galaxy”, the  Rennai system was not a place one wanted to visit for very long.  Kyrie woke up just as the ship made port, and turned around to  observe her neighbors.</p>
<p>“Howdy,  folks!” she exclaimed, her voice as passionate and fiery as her  spirit. “You all came from Mekratrig Four, right? Are we on  Strategos yet?”</p>
<p>“Um,  no,” Shana replied. “We had to stop in the Rennai system. Is it  true you’re a member of the great Lastgear family?”</p>
<p>“Hell  yeah!” she exclaimed, flapping her scarlet arms wildly. “I’m  Kyrie Lastgear, daughter of Kyrshe Lastgear, daughter of Taluna  Lastgear, the 3rd.  But you may call me AWESOME!” Shana couldn’t help but giggle;  Yenae rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s  a pyro like you headed to Strategos for?” Kyrie’s eyes lit up at  the mention of fire, and if she hadn’t been fastened in, she  would’ve leaped right out of her chair, no doubt crashing into some  poor defenceless passenger.</p>
<p>“I’m  glad you asked! I’m gonna bless Dr. Miracle with my presence! If he  wants to explore worlds and search for treasures, he’s gonna need a  genius inventor who knows how to turn up the heat!”</p>
<p>“Oh,  please,” Yenae groaned, “you’d burn down the whole ship with  everyone in it. Reds are good for nothing but destruction.”</p>
<p>“Hell  yeah! I can see we’re gonna get along great on this trip! I hope  you two are coming along! You can fight alongside me with your  gargoyle bad-ass-ness and insane adorability!”</p>
<p>“I’m  not just a cute face,” Shana pouted. Yenae growled and unfastened  her belt so she could give the fiery girl a piece of her mind, but  the stewards stopped her and told her it was not safe to stand up  just yet. Because Rennai was so dangerous and vile, the vessel was  only staying to refuel and let out departures—no boarding parties  unless they carried valid passes. Unfortunately, as about a dozen  people left the ship, two more came on, squeezing and wedging their  way through the crowds. Kyrie hollered and gave them an enthusiastic  welcome, and Shana quickly joined her. Yenae didn’t feel like being  her usual spunky self: just sitting next to a crazy arsonist was  enough to dampen her mood. Receiving additions from the Rennai system  made things a lot worse.</p>
<p>The  first person to make her way down the aisle resembled a spider,  probably because she had six arms instead of two. She kept most of  them tightly wound around her chest, but sometimes they slithered out  to ruffle people’s hair, or to steal things, or to make a quick  grope. She was not unattractive at all and in fact looked rather  beautiful, with great curly brunette hair and eyes that seemed  slightly bemused by everything. She had a playful look on her face,  but it was quite diabolical as well, like this woman saw everything  as an experiment to be poked and prodded—or dissected. She had  apparently not befriended her comrade, since they didn’t speak to  each other or give any indication that they were acquainted.</p>
<p>“Pardon,”  she said, her voice both pretty and deadly, shuffling past Kyrie. Not  one to be intimidated by strange-looking people or residents of the  galaxy’s insane asylums, the red-skinned girl warmly welcomed her  new friend and shook all her hands.</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Valti Brignor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species:  Humanoid (</strong><em><strong>Ambidextro  sapien</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  Rennai 6</strong></p>
<p><strong>Occupation:  Animal geneticist</strong></p>
<p>“I  can tell we’ll get along quite well, Kyrie.” Valti winked—Kyrie  blushed—Yenae rolled her eyes. The other woman that came with Valti  almost looked like a man, for she had a powerful build and looked  quite heavy for a lady. Either she was a master athlete or else a  resident of the ironically-named Utopia, fifth in the Rennai system,  a world infamous for its heavy gravity and heavier filth. It was a  world of miners and fighters, creatures so tough that most travelers  went out of their way to avoid the system. The heavy-world woman had  a sharp, careful, intimidating look in her eye, borne from years of  surviving on one of the harshest worlds in all the Milky Way. Somehow  she managed to pull off being fairly attractive, but she frightened a  lot of people. Naturally Yenae was drawn to her, one kindred spirit  to another, and smiled fondly as the woman passed. There was just  enough room to allow her passage.</p>
<p>“You  can sit here. It’s a little crowded, but we’ll manage. I’m  Yenae, and this is my friend Shana.”</p>
<p>“How  do you do?” The petite girl’s friendly smile softened the large  woman’s heart, and she relaxed and let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>“Better  now. Is this ship really going to Strategos?”</p>
<p>“Nonstop,  once we lift off.”</p>
<p>“That’s  good.” She heaved a sigh of relief and laid back in her chair,  nearly breaking it with her overpowering strength. “I really don’t  care where we’re going, as long as it’s not back there. We could  be headed straight to Hell and I’d be satisfied.”</p>
<p>“You  don’t wanna go there!” Shana exclaimed. The woman stared at her  and laughed.</p>
<p>“You’re  awfully friendly. You said your name was Shana, right? If we’re all  going to Strategos together, I may as well introduce myself.”</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Kate Shepherd</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species:  Heavy-world human (</strong><em><strong>Homo-Herculean  sapien)</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  Utopia (Rennai 5)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Distinguishing  trait: Tattoo on her shoulder</strong></p>
<p>“That’s  some tat,” Kyrie said as she looked over. Kate covered it up  bashfully and turned to face her new friends. The Red just laughed  and jabbed Valti. “I think we got us a disciple of Sappho here, Val  my dear!”</p>
<p>“She  doesn’t look like a poet,” mused the six-armed woman.</p>
<p>“No,  ass! I mean she likes other girls! Why else have a picture of a naked  broad riding a missile?”</p>
<p>“Don’t  ask me. It’s definitely sexual in nature. The missile is clearly a  phallic symbol—“</p>
<p>“Will  you two be quiet?” Kate bellowed. “Mind your own damned business,  okay? I just got it because I liked how it looked. She’s supposed  to be a bad-ass, like me.”</p>
<p>“It  does look really cool,” Shana squeaked. “I would’ve made it a  lot better, though.”</p>
<p>“Oh,  are you an artist?” Kate quickly struck up a conversation with her  new friends—what nice, warm people they were!—and spent most of  her time getting to know her would-be partners. Fate had apparently  thrown them all together, for they were dreaming of working for the  magnificent Dr. Miracle, each with her own motive. Shana hoped to  paint pictures of all the beautiful planets; Valti and Kyrie wanted  to expand their research; Kate wanted to get as far away from Utopia  as she could; Yenae was a freelancer and an adventurer. They all came  with their own set of quirks, problems, virtues, and faults, and  seeing how things played out once they arrived on Strategos would be  most interesting…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Pleasure  Unit 729 had gone exactly thirty-seven days without sexual  satisfaction, and for her, an artificial human selectively  manufactured for the specific purpose of delivering sexual  gratification, going that long without getting it on was highly  maddening. It was like having the worst possible itch all day and  being unable to scratch it, or suffering through a strict diet during  holiday seasons, or being stopped by countless traffic lights when  time has become an enemy. But there was no use whining, because there  were only two people in that entire ship: one the pilot and mechanic,  the other a safeguard against marauders looking for a quick plunder,  and it was useless trying to seduce the pilot. Unit 729 despised that  bratty little girl and her workaholic spirit. What a tool she was!  She wouldn’t satisfy her urges with that child even if her life  depended on it.</p>
<p>That  was perfectly fine with repair and maintenance Unit 18273645: she  didn’t want anything to do with “that slutty tramp” either. She  was a reclusive workaholic who always went out of her way to avoid a  conflict, and true to her programming, kept busy with ship  maintenance rather than risking an encounter with her loose  companion. She despised that whore for whisking her away and ruining  her life, but for the moment, the two mismatched ladies were forced  to work together. They needed someone who could work the ship and  they needed protection—but once they reached Strategos, they would  no longer have to see each other again. Unit 18273645 had no  intention of following her nymphomaniac companion into Dr. Miracle’s  employ.</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Herut (Unit 18273645</strong>)</p>
<p><strong>Species:  Artificial human (</strong><em><strong>Homunculi  sapien</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  Centania</strong></p>
<p><strong>Programming:  Craft repair and maintenance</strong></p>
<p><strong>Name:  Chandra (Unit 729)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species:  Artificial human (</strong><em><strong>Homunculi  sapien</strong></em><strong>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  Andromeda Prime</strong></p>
<p><strong>Programming:  Sexual gratification</strong></p>
<p>Chandra  and Herut had rarely spoken since their initial meeting, probably  because they both knew it would only lead to another argument. The  authorities were after them both—Chandra because she had actually  stolen the ship they were using and Herut because she was an  accomplice and a runaway, albeit through no fault of her own. Staying  on any planet for very long was dangerous, and they were forced to  make several quick dashes for freedom as local law enforcement heard  about them. Luckily, Herut could repair any craft and wasn’t too  shabby a pilot, and so maintenance wasn’t a problem. Also, Chandra  could seduce practically anybody with her wiles, though in truth, she  wished she could run into more women. A glitch in her program made  her attracted to females only—a condition not entirely new for the  increasingly-popular pleasure units.</p>
<p>One  of their few conversations concerned their ultimate destination.  While roaming around several worlds, trying to evade the eyes of the  police and military, Chandra had noticed several flyers for Dr.  Miracle’s advertisement. Chandra was deathly afraid of danger and  risk, but the prospect of being around all those women overruled her  fears and clouded her judgment. She vowed to be a part of that crew  no matter what it took, and forced Herut to take them to Strategos.</p>
<p>“You  do realize that we’re going to a very popular spaceport,” she  stated bitterly. “I know your hormones have damaged what little  brain cells you were born with, but surely even you realize that if  we go there, we’ll get caught.”</p>
<p>“We’ve  never gotten caught before,” Chandra replied. Her voice was always  sultry, just as Herut’s always got down to business; they couldn’t  help it. She giggled and pinched the young woman’s nose. “Don’t  worry so much. I can charm anybody into forgetting all about us. You  just have to land this thing. I think it’d be best if we destroyed  the ship once we got there.”</p>
<p>“For  once we agree. You can go play with Dr. Miracle for all I care; I  want nothing to do with you anymore.”</p>
<p>“So  what will you do when we get to Strategos? Not that I care,” she  made sure that Herut understood, “I’m just curious.” Herut  shook her head. She hadn’t thought that far ahead. All she wanted  was to be far and away from Chandra, but if she started working solo,  eventually she would be caught, punished, and maybe even terminated.  Artificial humans do not usually come equipped with strong desires to  survive, and Herut was no exception. But she deemed herself too  important to be scrapped or recycled—she wanted to live after  all—and unfortunately, staying with Chandra seemed the best chance  she had. Hopefully, Dr. Miracle would not accept the sex fiend, and  would pass her over in favor of the superior mechanic. That would  solve both their problems…but how likely was that? If Chandra was  able to seduce Dr. Miracle, Herut was doomed.</p>
<p>“What  will I do?” she said in response. “How should I know? Just go  away and leave me alone.”</p>
<p>“Happily.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Yenae  had been so animated in her conversation with Kate that she failed to  realize that Shana had fallen asleep. She was resting her head on the  woman’s shoulder, her mouth slightly open, her breath calming and  peaceful, the epitome of adorable sweetness. Yenae couldn’t help  but stretch her arm out and brush against her cheek; it had been some  time since she had been so close to somebody. Kate smiled faintly and  waited patiently for those ahead of her to disembark: the transport  had finally landed on Strategos, only a day after leaving Trig 4.</p>
<p>Valti  and Kyrie were so engrossed with each other that they didn’t even  realize they had stopped. Valti came from Rennai 6, a penal colony,  and one mainly populated by criminal scientists such as her. She  didn’t reveal how she had escaped that fate, but she was quite open  about her occupation, and Kyrie—a fellow scientist with a few  screws loose—was enraptured from the first moment. They became  inseparable; Kate had to bang against their chairs to snap them out  of their engagement.</p>
<p>“If  you two don’t stop, I’ll tie you <em>both</em> down and see how <em>you</em> like being cut up into little pieces!”</p>
<p>“A  woman after my own heart,” Valti sighed. She wrapped her arms  around her body so they wouldn’t bang into anything—having six is  a lot more troublesome than having two—and followed Kyrie and the  others out of the transport. None of them had ever been to Strategos  before, so this promised to be a wonderful experience for them all.  It’s officially classified as a gas planet, with massive white  clouds full of steam that float across the sky like icebergs. The  planet’s atmosphere is similar to Helios 3: its composition is  mostly oxygen, with trace amounts of nitrogen, hydrogen, helium,  carbon monoxide, and several other gases. Because the atmosphere is  breathable, explorers have worked diligently to colonize and populate  Strategos—a wise move considering how rich in minerals the clouds  were.</p>
<p>“Cloud  farming” was a popular and relatively easy way to reap the benefits  of a gas planet. The outer worlds of the Helios system provided a  nearly endless supply of minerals and elements for those bizarre  species that lived on such noxious fumes (and there were a lot), and  Strategos was an ideal world for more human residents. Constructing  floating “cities” in the clouds is normally a fiendishly  difficult and outrageously expensive venture, but to the surprise of  explorers and colonists, there were already a few floating islands  hovering in the Strategos sky, left behind by some ancient and  powerful race. While most of these islands were no bigger than a  city, a few were the size of a continent, perfect for creating  spaceports. It was upon one of these floating continents that the  five travelers landed (with no worry of falling over since there were  several layers of security to ensure that even the clumsiest people  were safe).</p>
<p>“Fascinating,”  Valti said, stroking her chin as she released her arms. “Ahh, that  feels better. It’s nice having some elbow room for once. I hope  nobody here’s afraid of heights.” Kate was the only one that  seemed really uncomfortable; she had lived on solid ground surrounded  by buildings and walls all her life, and even though Strategos was  beautiful and its air was clear and fresh, she couldn’t properly  enjoy it.</p>
<p>“Awesome!”  Shana exclaimed, ready to hug the whole world. “I gotta paint this  place! Oh, that reminds me…” Shana had been carrying four pieces  of paper with her, and she gave them to her new friends. She hadn’t  finished Valti’s portrait since she was still stuck on her arms  (and she had fallen asleep), but everyone else was impressed at the  representation. She had really captured Yenae’s sweet face, Kate’s  majestic power, and Kyrie’s burning zeal. “I’ll finish yours in  just a second,” she promised Valti. The six-armed woman smiled  softly, but waved at her dismissively.</p>
<p>“Let’s  worry about later. It seems we have more pressing matters ahead.”  Shana looked over and gasped—there were twelve dark, smoky figures  barring their way, svelte and strong-looking, their faces covered,  their eyes aglow. They were all armed and clearly out for blood.</p>
<p>“Friends  of yours?” Kate asked Kyrie. The Red flapped her wings impatiently.</p>
<p>“I’ve  never seen em’ before. Just what are you accusing me of, anyway?”</p>
<p>“You  and your new buddy are clearly the most evil people in our group, and  therefore most likely to be acquainted with evil-looking creatures,”  Yenae said. Shana hid behind the Changeling as the mysterious  assassins charged for an attack. Valti suddenly burst out in maniacal  laughter and reached for her concealed weapons: a sword, a gun, a  studded club, a claw, and a chainsaw (how she managed to smuggle all  that on the transport was a mystery). Not to be outdone, Kyrie  whipped out a flamethrower and brandished it with demonic glee,  scorching at least two of the assassins right away.</p>
<p>Everyone  else was a little more graceful. Shana was a staunch pacifist and  probably wouldn’t even be able to fight for her life, so Yenae and  Kate protected her and kept the attackers at bay. Yenae reached into  her coat and pulled out several throwing knives; she tossed them with  near-perfect accuracy, piercing through three of the enemy and  warding four more off. Kate ran in and engaged them hand-to-hand,  lifting one high above her head and tossing it into a large cluster.  Even Shana helped by kicking one while its back was turned and  warning her new friends of approaching danger.</p>
<p>As  Valti cut through the last one, she was surprised to discover a dark  haze evaporating from the body. The fog drifted into the infinite air  of Strategos and was lost. There was now nothing left of the assassin  except the passing odor of its remains; it had vanished completely.</p>
<p>“Interesting,”  Valti mused. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that was  some kind of homunculus created by animating smoke or some other  visible vapor—mist, fog, steam…there’s plenty on this world.”</p>
<p>“It  felt real to me,” Kate grunted as she nursed a scratch. “Whatever  those things were, they had weapons and they could definitely hurt  people with them.”</p>
<p>“But  why would they attack us like that?” Shana wondered, her eyes  brimming with fear and questions. Yenae smiled warmly and ruffled her  hair.</p>
<p>“Well,  Valti is obviously a wanted criminal, and Kyrie is clearly an  arsonist. Kate doesn’t seem like a bad person, but she did say she  had to get away from Utopia…”</p>
<p>“Stop  blaming us for all your problems!” Kyrie screamed. Yenae giggled.</p>
<p>“Just  teasing. Maybe they were a test sent by Dr. Miracle.” Shana clung  to Yenae suddenly and pulled on her elbow.</p>
<p>“I  hope that’s not true—look!” There was now a significantly  larger cluster of the Fog-Men surrounding them, roughly fifty in  total, if not more. Where they came from, how they had assembled so  quickly, and what they were after were questions that would be  answered once the battle was over and the travelers made it to the <em>Dauntless</em>—that  is, if their enemies allowed them that luxury. For now, there was  nothing to do but fight, and hope that they all made it out of this  predicament in one piece…</p>
