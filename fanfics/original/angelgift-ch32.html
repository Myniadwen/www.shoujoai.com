The stateroom in the starship Liberty&#39;s Sword was
dimly lit, only the light from the stars outside
casting a gentle glow over the two resting figures.
Jenna and Allison lay on the bed in a tangle of limbs,
the sheets a mess from the night of passion they had
spent together.

Jenna sat up, smiling down at Allison as the faint
light danced over her near nude body, long black hair
flowing over her shoulders. &quot;Every night I think it
can&#39;t get better,&quot; she murmured, &quot;then the next night
you prove me wrong.&quot;

Allison blushed, the boyish young woman smiling up as
she gazed at her through sandy brown hair. &quot;I get
inspired by the sight of your beauty,&quot; she softly
confessed, reaching up to gently cup a full breast.

Jenna moaned softly as she felt her nipple harden
under that knowing touch, then she bent down to kiss
Allison gently. &quot;You&#39;d best not start anything,&quot; she
said with a bit of regret in her voice, &quot;or we&#39;ll
never get anything done tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Allison conceded, gently drawing Jenna closer
so that they could cuddle. She smiled faintly,
stroking her lover&#39;s long hair as she murmured to her,
&quot;Thank you for being so patient with me, by the way.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Jenna looked at her curiously.

&quot;For how long it took for me to realize your feelings
for me were real,&quot; Allison said softly, &quot;and to accept
my own feelings for you.&quot;

Jenna lay her head on Allison&#39;s shoulder, loving the
feel of the slimmer woman&#39;s body beneath her. &quot;My
people know our soulmate the first time we see them,&quot;
she reminded her, &quot;once I met you, I knew that I would
love you.&quot;

&quot;I just wish it was that straight forward for humans,&quot;
Allison said wryly. She hugged Jenna to her a bit
tighter as she remembered, &quot;Of course, at first I was
just completely overwhelmed by your beauty and grace.&quot;

&quot;Not to mention my being an alien,&quot; Jenna purred.

&quot;That, too,&quot; Allison agreed.

&quot;I have a confession to make,&quot; Jenna said softly after
a few moments.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Allison looked curious.

Jenna snuggled close, &quot;No matter what I may have said
at the time, I always knew that you were a woman.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no problem,&quot; Allison reassured her, &quot;I know I
dress and look pretty boyish.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean,&quot; Jenna actually chuckled
softly, &quot;you see, I saw you naked when I bonded with
you when we first met.&quot;

&quot;You did?&quot; Allison squeaked, blushing.

&quot;Your shyness is so charming,&quot; Jenna mused, reaching
up to lightly trace the red blush on her cheeks with a
finger. Getting back on topic she added, &quot;Yes, I saw
you naked. Your clothes were shredded by your injuries
when I crashed on your home, you know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Allison admitted, &quot;I just hadn&#39;t thought
about it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Jenna actually purred a little as she
snuggled up to Allison, &quot;I never took advantage at
all.&quot;

Allison blushed again, though this time it wasn&#39;t so
bad. &quot;I had a few moments where I thought I was going
to take advantage of you,&quot; she remembered with a grin,
&quot;like just after we met Roma and Marilyn.&quot;

&quot;That nightgown was good,&quot; Jenna laughed, &quot;I decided
it was time to get your attention.&quot;

&quot;It certainly did that,&quot; Allison agreed.

&quot;I really enjoyed undressing you, too,&quot; Jenna pouted a
bit, &quot;though I was surprised you stayed on your side
of the bed that night.&quot;

&quot;What can I say, I was raised a gentleman,&quot; Allison
sighed.

&quot;Your parents have much to answer for,&quot; Jenna teased.
She sighed, &quot;There were times I thought I&#39;d go mad for
wanting you.&quot;

&quot;Ditto,&quot; Allison agreed with her wryly. She grinned
suddenly, &quot;And where were you getting all those
different sexy night clothes, anyway? I thought I was
going to have a stroke, seeing some of those outfits.&quot;

&quot;Milly shops for me, remember?&quot; Jenna chuckled. She
impishly smiled, &quot;I figured if I was going to be
tortured I&#39;d make you want me, too.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry for taking so long,&quot; Allison repeated.

&quot;If anything it endeared me to you more,&quot; Jenna smiled
slightly. She ran a finger gently along her cheek, &quot;I
have faced more than one aggressive suitor, and my
position drew the power hungry in like flies to
honey.&quot;

&quot;I bet you saw through them pretty easily,&quot; Allison
said confidently, rubbing her shoulders comfortingly.

&quot;True,&quot; Jenna agreed, &quot;but it was lonely for me at
times. You were such pleasant surprise... even once
you knew my rank and power, you never seemed to care.&quot;

&quot;I probably didn&#39;t understand entirely, too,&quot; Allison
admitted ruefully. They lay there for a few moments in
comfortable silence, then she asked, &quot;So, what&#39;s
next?&quot;

&quot;Throneworld,&quot; Jenna sighed, &quot;and knowing my mother, a
very quick marriage.&quot;

&quot;I like you mother,&quot; Allison admitted, &quot;even if she
scares me a bit.&quot;

&quot;I think she likes you, too,&quot; Jenna said happily, &quot;and
almost as importantly, X&#39;tahn has given you her
approval.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not just you mom&#39;s servant, is she?&quot; she asked,
Allison smiling slightly.

&quot;X&#39;tahn is my mother&#39;s dearest companion,&quot; Jenna said
softly, &quot;and lover, I suspect.&quot;

Allison nodded slightly, thinking of how those two had
been together, the way they acted. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed,
&quot;I can see that. I wonder if they&#39;ll try to slip in a
second wedding?&quot;

&quot;You and Milly think alike,&quot; Jenna looked amused, &quot;she
suggested much the same. Still, it would be dangerous
right now.&quot;

&quot;She needs the loyalty of some very conservative
lords,&quot; Allison agreed. She sighed, &quot;Once you
explained how the army is actually made up of troops
who&#39;s main loyalty is to their local lords, it all
made sense.&quot;

&quot;Checks and balances,&quot; Jenna agreed, &quot;the Lords help
prevent the Queen from becoming a dictator even as she
moderates between them and the common people.&quot;

&quot;Not an easy job at all,&quot; Allison nodded. She looked
thoughtful, &quot;Remind me to read through the datafile on
the customs at court... I don&#39;t want to embarrass
myself or make things any more difficult for you or
her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Jenna purred, resting her head on
Allison&#39;s shoulder. They lay there a few moments, &quot;Not
that you&#39;d ever embarrass me.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Allison chuckled softly. A few moments later
and she felt Jenna&#39;s breathing even out, her lover
having slipped into sleep. &quot;Night, love,&quot; she
whispered softly.

Sleep, however, didn&#39;t come as quickly to Allison
herself. It had been a hectic few days, the most
recent high being meeting the Queen and she was still
a bit to excited to sleep. Then there was her upcoming
wedding to consider... she had known, intellectually
that they would need to be married eventually, but the
sudden announcement had surprised her a bit none the
less. Still, it was a good surprise and she thought
she was ready for it.

&#39;Wonder how they do weddings here?&quot; Allison thought
sleepily, &#39;Do they have a best man, or something
else...?&#39; Her eyes dipped half shut, &#39;Never mind,
Jenna will tell me....&#39; And finally her eyes closed,
sleep catching up to her at last.
