Lord Holland licked his lips as a servant placed a plate of food before 
him, &quot;Lilian, I have no idea what you did but I am grateful to have such 
a brilliant daughter as you.&quot; He remarked proudly as he studied a 
sizzling stake, his mouth watering.

&quot;It was nothing father.&quot; Lilian lightly boosted.

Alison shook her head in dismay, &quot;It is not like you made the meal.&quot; She 
stated from across the dinning table. &quot;You just ordered them around like 
you do to everyone.&quot; She noted with a sneer.

&quot;Be quiet you little demon.&quot; Lilian spat across the table. She always 
sat opposite her little sisters. She loathed the idea of being near them 
and at this moment she was being reminded of why, &quot;I cannot believe I 
have to eat my dinner with you three psychos.&quot; She muttered as she 
stabbed a fork into her stake and cut apiece off. 

&quot;Thanks for the complement.&quot; Alice replied licking her lips at the stake 
before her. The smell was like nothing she had ever dreamt. She glanced 
at Alexandra sitting next to her and blushed. The passed couple of days 
were more then she could ever wish for. It was like someone had been 
listening to her greatest desires and was making them come true.

Alison giggles at her friend&#39;s remark, &quot;Father, Thank you for letting 
Alice stay for dinner.&quot; She said, giving her older sister a sinister 
grin that caused the girl the snarl under her breath.

&quot;It is a delight.&quot; The lord stated with a smile at the girls, &quot;It is so 
rare that we have guests. She can stay the night if she so chooses.&quot; 

&quot;Really!?!&quot; Alice exclaimed through a mouth full of steak, then 
swallowed, embarrassed by her lack of manners, &quot;Thank you my lord!&quot; She 
stated gratefully.

Abruptly the dinning hall&#39;s door flung upon and Burnwell rushed into the 
room with Charles closely behind him. The three young girls stared up 
from their food in shock as they starred at the actor.

&quot;Burnwell! Where have you been?&quot; Lord Holland demanded displeased by the 
butler disturbing their dinner. 

&quot;I am... sorry... my lord.&quot; The butler struggled to catch his breath, 
&quot;Things have been... difficult...&quot; He remarked looking at Charles. 

&quot;That is no reason to go wandering off and suddenly appear when you 
feel.&quot; The lord returned irately, &quot;You know I can not deal with those 
servants of ours without you.&quot; 

&quot;I am sorry, my lord.&quot; Charles interjected, &quot;You see there seems to be 
an angry mob in town and they kept us from returning sooner.&quot; 

&quot;A mob you say?&quot; The Lord inquired curiously, &quot;What could stir the 
townsfolk into such a state?&quot; 

&quot;I do not know, my lord,&quot; The butler replied with a nervous glance at 
Charles, &quot;but they seem to be heading for the Greystoke Castle. They 
seem to be angry with Lady Greystoke.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, is that the case.&quot; Lilian remarked dryly, &quot;I hope the mob takes 
good care of that creepy woman.&quot; 

&quot;Right!&quot; The Lord exclaimed, glad to hear of the downfall of the 
Greystoke family, &quot;It is not an affair of ours, so let us continue with 
our meal.&quot; He explained stabbing a piece of stake and prepared to eat it 
when he glanced at the actor, &quot;Charles would you like to join us? We are 
having stake today.&quot; He announced gleefully. 

&quot;It would be an honour, my lord.&quot; The actor replied with a bow. He gave 
the butler a passing grin as he strolled around the table and pulled out 
a chair beside Lilian, &quot;Do you mind if I sit here, my lady?&quot; He inquired 
politely.

&quot;Please do.&quot; Lilian gestured to the chair and the actor pulled out the 
chair, smiling across the table at the three young girls as he sat. They 
all watched the man attentively with dumbfounded expressions upon their 
faces. All three immediately noticed the wound on the man&#39;s shoulder and 
could not take their eyes off of it. 

&quot;Evening ladies.&quot; Charles grin broadened causing the girls to shutter in 
their seats, &quot;It is so nice to be part of the family.&quot; He stated beaming 
at Burnwell.

&quot;Burnwell, could you get our guest a plate.&quot; The lord ordered the 
butler, who reluctantly left the room in a huff. The lord noticed the 
way the girls were eyed their new arrival, &quot;Oh Girls, have you met 
Charles... ummm...&quot; The lord stammered over the actor&#39;s name then turned 
to the man, &quot;What was your name again, good man?&quot; 

&quot;Charles Langton, my lord.&quot; Charles replied, his eyes not turning from 
the girls. 

&quot;Oh yes! And these are my daughters, Alison and Alexandra.&quot; Lord Holland 
gestured to the twins then to their friend, &quot;And this is their friend, 
Alice.&quot; 

&quot;Pleasure to finally meet you lovely young ladies.&quot; Charles greeted the 
girls and raised from his seat to give a deep bow, &quot;I thank you all for 
allowing a humble actor like myself to eat at such a luxurious hall as 
this.&quot; He remarked gratefully. As he sat back down he noticed that the 
girls were still staring at him, &quot;Have we met before?&quot; He inquired 
curiously. 

Alexandria was the first to shake the shock from her mind, &quot;We saw you 
in town today.&quot; Alex replied nonchalantly, finally regaining her 
composure, &quot;You were outside of the tailor&#39;s shop I think.&quot; She remarked 
giving the actor a challenging look. 

If the actor was not already pale he would have changed several shades 
that very moment, &quot;Oh, I see.&quot; He remarked, pulling on his collar and 
revealing his torn throat, &quot;If I had only have known that you were the 
missing Holland twins then I would have taken you straight home right 
away.&quot; He said with a nervous smile to Lord Holland.

&quot;That is very thoughtful of you.&quot; The lord commented, returning the 
man&#39;s smile, &quot;But that is in the past so do not worry so.&quot; He remarked.

Burnwell suddenly returned with a patter in hand and set it in front of 
Charles, &quot;Be careful what you say to those two.&quot; He whispered cautiously 
while eyeing the three young girls, &quot;They may seem innocent but they are 
nothing more then terrors and if they find out about your condition your 
welcome here could quickly shift.&quot; He warned the actor then rose and 
walked over to the Lord&#39;s side, &quot;Will that be all, my lord.&quot; He 
inquired; hoping uneasily that the man would request more food or drink, 
anything to keep him in the same room as Charles. He wanted to be sure 
that no one discovers the man&#39;s secret and if they did he wished to be 
there to bail the actor out.

&quot;That will be fine.&quot; The Lord replied, &quot;I will call for you if needed.&quot; 
With that he gestured for the butler to leave. 

Burnwell stood rooted to his place for a moment unable to will his legs 
to move. Alexandria was scanning his lover like an animal sizing up her 
prey. Burnwell knew very well that after Alexandria has set those eyes 
on someone they are more then likely to disappear overnight. &quot;A... are 
you sure, my lord?&quot; He inquired nervously, &quot;My ladies?&quot; He added with 
increasingly manic tone to his voice that draws the girl&#39;s attention 
away from Charles. 

&quot;Are you alright, Burnwell?&quot; Lilian inquired considerately, &quot;You are 
looking a tad pale.&quot; She noted glancing at the butler.

&quot;I... I will be fine, My Lady.&quot; Burnwell stammered glancing from Lilian 
to the twins in a way that made Lilian understand what was distressing 
the man. She scanned the three girls in search of what they could be 
planning only to have them return her gaze with cold stares that made 
her heart jump.

Alexandria examined Charles carefully as she thought over the events of 
the day. She was certain she could see worry upon the actors face, but 
was unsure how she could use this to her advantage. She merrily noticed 
that the anxiety seemed to have spread to the butler and even her older 
sister and was revelling in their restlessness when her twin sister 
started pulling on her sleeve, &quot;What is it Alison?&quot; She inquired coldly, 
she did not like when her sister interrupted her musings. 

&quot;In the garden!&quot; Alison whispered into her sister&#39;s ear, &quot;Behind the 
man.&quot; 

Alexandra moved her gaze from the actor to the large window that faced 
the garden. A dark shadow moved in obscurity quickly followed by yet 
another. Alex watched the shadows with intense curiosity. She stood to 
her feet trying to figure out what the movement could be when suddenly 
one of them came directly at the windows. It stumbled through a patch of 
flowers and it became apparent that the shadow was a human, &quot;Ummm... 
Father...&quot; She swallowed hard as she thought of the angry mob gathering 
in the village came to mind. Could they have come for them, or maybe it 
was the actor that they were interested in? 

&quot;What is it dear?&quot; The lord followed his daughter&#39;s gaze to see a 
growing number of shadowy figures stumbling about the garden and he 
slammed his fork down on his plate, &quot;What do they think they are doing 
in my garden?&quot; He exclaimed rising to get a better look out the window. 

&quot;Who?&quot; Lilian asked, curiously turning to get a look at what had caught 
her father&#39;s eye.

Charles quickly got to his feet and backed around the table in an 
attempt to gain some distance from the windows, &quot;H... how did they find 
me?&quot; He stammered softly. 

Burnwell rushed to the man&#39;s side, &quot;Do you think they followed us?&quot; He 
whispered. 

Alex was the only one to notice the actor and butler as they crept from 
the room, &quot;Maybe they are friends of Charles here.&quot; She commented with a 
grin that made Charles spin shiver in fear. At that moment one of the 
figures slammed up against the window with such force that it caused a 
couple of the girls to scream out in fright.  

Alice jumped to her feet, startled by what she saw, &quot;Cecil!!!&quot; She cried 
out. 

Cecil spotted his cousin and the blood around his lips cracked as he 
grinned at the girl. He tapped on the glass pointing at Alice. Another 
figure approached the window to reveal a rather decayed body of a man. 
He was missing one of his arms and his head partly sunken in as if 
someone had violently beat it in with something rather solid. 

&quot;The graveyard!!&quot; Alexandria exclaimed suddenly realizing that the 
garden was filled with hundreds of walking corpses, &quot;They must have come 
back to life.&quot; She muttered under her breath. She suddenly noticed that 
several of the people looked very familiar. 

Alison leaned close to her sister, &quot;Alex, I think we killed that man 
last year.&quot; She observed with a swallow. 

Alexandra nodded, &quot;Yeah and there is Mrs. Wisconsin from last month.&quot; 
She whispered with a glance over at a rather old woman in a tattered 
dress and several cut marks across her face and hands, &quot;We have to get 
out of here.&quot; She grabbed the back of Alice&#39;s dress and began to pull 
the girl out of the hall. 

&quot;Get out of there!!!&quot; Lord Holland shouted waving his fist at the 
people, not seeming to notice that the people were not alive. 

&quot;I do not think they will listen.&quot; Lilian remarked, then she noticed 
that they were alone in the room, &quot;I think we should follow the others.&quot; 
She stated trying to hide her panic. 

One of the corpses pounded on the window in front of Lord Holland and he 
staggered back from it, &quot;Y...yes... I think we should.&quot; The two rushed 
out of the room in search of the others. 

*****

Amanda stood before a full-length mirror in her new bedroom. Anita had 
carefully cleaned ever last speck of blood from Amanda&#39;s face and even 
around the hole in her eye. At that moment Anita was fighting with the 
strings at the back of the long dark gown that Maria had lent Amanda. 

&quot;There you go, my lady.&quot; Anita stepped away as she fastened the long 
collar in place. 

&quot;Thank you Anita.&quot; Amanda replied gratefully. She spun around a few time 
to get a better look at herself in the mirror. The gown fit snug around 
her waist and chest. The sleeves were lace covered in rose patterns that 
worked well against Amanda&#39;s pale skin. If it were not for the gapping 
hole in her eye she would not even have thought she was dead. She leaned 
closer to the mirror to get a better look at the wound and gingerly 
touched the edge of her eye socket and let out a sigh. 

As if Anita understood she stepped before the mirror to block Amanda 
from viewing her image and began to fuss about the collar, &quot;You look 
glorious, my lady.&quot; She stated in a calming tone. 

Amanda bowed her head in shame, &quot;I am sorry, Anita.&quot; She apologized 
dismally, &quot;I wish I could take your words as adoring as they are, 
but...&quot; 

Anita placed a finger upon the girl&#39;s lips to hush her, &quot;We have already 
gone over this, My Lady.&quot; Anita reminded the girl, &quot;Lady Clara stated 
she would fix your eye and I do believe she is telling the truth.&quot; 

&quot;I hope you are right.&quot; Amanda said with a sigh, &quot;but how do we know 
that Lady Clara was not just trying to comfort me and there was really 
no way to fix my eye.&quot; She stated miserably as she sat upon the edge of 
her bed, &quot;I am doomed to be a hideous monster for the rest of my life... 
ummm... death...&quot; She shook her head in dismay. 

Anita sat next to the girl and wrapped an arm around her shoulders, &quot;She 
was able to bring Lady Maria and Lady... uuhhh... Lord... I mean... 
Jamie back to life so I think that fixing your eye should be a simple 
task for her.&quot; She hugged Amanda tightly. 

The thought of such a possibility raised Amanda spirited, &quot;You are 
right.&quot; A smile crossed her face; she suddenly grabbed Anita around the 
waist and pulled her onto the bed. 

&quot;My lady!?!&quot; Anita exclaimed, startled to find she had landed atop of 
Amanda. She stared down at the girl and found herself leaning in for a 
kiss when there was a knock at the door. 

&quot;What is this about?&quot; Maria asked with a smirk upon her face as she 
stood in the guest room door. 

&quot;Lady Maria,&quot; Anita jumped to her feet and fixed her dress, &quot;Have you 
finished helping Lord Jamie dress?&quot; She inquired nervously. 

Amanda sat up in the bed with a flush upon her face, &quot;I am sorry Maria. 
I did not mean... I...&quot; 

Maria let out a small giggle, &quot;You two looked so cute together.&quot; She 
stated with a grin upon her face. 

&quot;Lady Maria... I...&quot; Anita glanced about the room anxiously. 

Maria crossed the room to Anita&#39;s side, &quot;Take care of her as you did 
me.&quot; She remarked with a knowing grin. 

Amanda quickly got to her feet, &quot;Maria, are you sure? I mean I do not 
wish to take her from you.&quot; 

Anita&#39;s blush brightened, &quot;But... My Lady... Am I not yours... 
forever...?&quot; She inquired uneasily. 

Maria set her forehead against Anita&#39;s, &quot;You will always be with me, 
however if you wish to be there for Amanda as well then feel free.&quot; She 
then dropped her voice to a whisper, &quot;She needs someone too.&quot;  

&quot;You really mean that?&quot; Amanda clapped her hands together, &quot;She already 
offered to be my personal maid along side you, but we wanted to ask your 
opinion first.&quot; 

&quot;I trust Anita with my life.&quot; Maria stated bluntly, not taking her eyes 
off the maid, &quot;And I would trust her with my friends as well.&quot;  

&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; Jamie inquired as she came down the hall, &quot;Did 
something happen to Lady Amanda?&quot; 

&quot;Not much.&quot; Maria replied with a wink to the two girls. She turned to 
see the teddy sitting in the arms of her body. A tiny little black bow 
tie and white collar were fastened neatly around her neck and a black 
vest covered the rest of her small bear body, &quot;You looks so adorable.&quot; 
Maria partly squealed and rushed over to snatch the teddy from the 
corpse&#39;s hands. 

&quot;I do not!&quot; Jamie retorted, &quot;I look ridiculous.&quot;

&quot;You look very adorable.&quot; Amanda agreed with Maria, &quot;And your body looks 
very handsome too.&quot; She remarked examining Jamie&#39;s headless body. 
Jamie&#39;s body was clad in the finest of tuxedos, Maria&#39;s mother demanded 
that Jamie dress properly for the dinner and sent a servant with the 
clothes after she got out of the bath. All three girls found themselves 
stunned by the way the suit looked upon Jamie&#39;s frame, &quot;You would never 
guess there was a girl under there.&quot; Amanda noted as she circled the 
body in amusement. 

&quot;I agree.&quot; Anita commented, &quot;I never thought a headless person could 
look so charming.&quot;

&quot;I would look better if I still had my head.&quot; Jamie restate grumpily. 

&quot;You still upset over that?&quot; Maria inquired with a sigh, &quot;Mother told 
you it was not likely she would be able to return your head and she 
apologized too. I do not see why you are so upset.&quot; 

&quot;You still have you head.&quot; Jamie replied irritated by the insensitive of 
her lover, &quot;I bet my head is laying in some garbage right now.&quot; She 
grumbled. 

Maria hugged the teddy tightly, &quot;We will work thing out. As long as we 
are together right?&quot; She inquired happily. 

&quot;What if she figures out that I am not a boy?&quot; Jamie worried, &quot;I mean we 
cannot keep this a secret forever.&quot; She glanced at the maid with 
distress in her eyes. 

&quot;I promise not to tell, Lord Jamie.&quot; Anita remarked confidently. 

&quot;Will you stop worrying?&quot; Maria remarked and kissed the teddy on the 
head, &quot;Just be happy that we are together again. I know I am.&quot; 

Jamie bowed her head in shame and her body slumped in a similar manner, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just keep getting this feeling that things are going to 
collapse around us and when it does it will not be a pretty sight.&quot; Her 
body nodded in agreement, or it did the closest thing to a nod a 
headless corpse could. 

Amanda starred at the body in amazement, &quot;Does it always do that?&quot; She 
inquired with a slight shudder at the idea that the body could hear even 
without its head. 

&quot;It would seem the body is connected to Jamie is some way.&quot; Maria 
explained lightly, &quot;We will have to leave that for a later time as we 
should get to the dinning hall. Mother will be angry if we are late.&quot; 
She stated then quickly moved down the hall with Jamie&#39;s body following 
closely behind.  

Anita began to follow her mistress when Amanda took her by the hand and 
pulled her back, &quot;Lady Amanda?&quot; Anita inquired curiously as the girl 
hugged her tightly. 

&quot;Did you mean what you said earlier?&quot; Amanda stared intensely into 
Anita&#39;s eyes, &quot;About being my first?&quot; 

Anita smiled at Amanda, &quot;Whenever you so wish, my lady.&quot; She quickly 
turned and rushed after Lady Maria. 

Amanda shook the feelings that filled her head and hurried after the 
others. 

&quot;I&#39;m so glad you could all make it.&quot; Clara exclaimed happily as the 
group of girls entered the dining hall, &quot;Why do you not look wonderful.&quot; 
She declared, circling around the table to look upon the girls&#39; attire. 

&quot;Thank you, my lady.&quot; Amanda replied with a curtsy, &quot;And thank you again 
for letting me stay. Are you sure Lord Greystoke will not mind?&quot; She 
asked in a concerned tone. 

&quot;Do not fret, Child.&quot; Clara returned then turned to look upon the teddy 
bear in Maria&#39;s arms, &quot;Why you do look splendid Lord James.&quot; Clara 
stated taking Jamie from her daughter&#39;s arms. 

&quot;Uhhh... thank you... Lady Clara.&quot; Jamie stammered trying to remember 
her manners. She promised Maria that she would try her best to stay on 
Clara better side. If they were to stay together they would need to keep 
Clara in blissful ignorance or she might find out Jamie&#39;s secrets and 
then they would be in real trouble.

&quot;I have someone I wish to introduce you too.&quot; Clara stated excitedly as 
she walked around the table with Jamie&#39;s body following her, &quot;I would 
like you to meet your future father-in-law, Lord Greystoke.&quot; She said 
holding Jamie up to a large tank of yellowish liquid.

&quot;My lord?!?&quot; Jamie blinked at the brain floating within the tank in 
disbelief. This could not possibly be the same person she delivered the 
paper to just the other day, could it?

&quot;Hello?&quot; Lord Greystoke replied, intrigued to hear a new voice, &quot;Who may 
this be? I was beginning to think no one would come to talk to me.&quot; He 
said miserably.  

&quot;Lord Greystoke, I would like to introduce you too Lord James.&quot; Clara 
set Jamie in the chair next to the Lord. 

&quot;It is a pleasure to meet you Lord James.&quot; Lord Greystoke replied in 
delight, &quot;It is always an honour to meet another lord. What family are 
you from?&quot;

&quot;Uhhh... uhhhh...&quot; Jamie stammered as she stared at the brain.

&quot;Th.... that is Lord Greystoke!!!&quot; Amanda exclaimed slightly alarmed by 
what she saw, &quot;You never told me your father was a brain in a box!&quot; She 
stared at Maria in astonishment. 

&quot;There was a slight accident.&quot; Maria explained shyly, feeling 
embarrassed by the way her friends were reacting to her father&#39;s 
appearance. 

&quot;Who is this sweet young voice I hear?&quot; Lord Greystoke requested 
tenderly,  &quot;Why have we not been introduced.&quot; 

&quot;I am sorry father.&quot; Maria approached the tank, &quot;This is Lady Amanda 
Dalant, father.&quot; Maria introduced, taking Amanda by the hand and pulling 
her along, &quot;Be polite.&quot; She whispered into her friend&#39;s ear, &quot;You do not 
want to be thrown out do you?&quot; She warned.

&quot;N.. No, but...&quot; Amanda stammered, her eyes not able to move from the 
floating brain, &quot;Uhhh... Ev... evening my lord...&quot; She greeted with a 
small curtsy. 

&quot;Amanda Dalant?&quot; Lord Greystoke milled the name over, &quot;I remember your 
father. He was worried about you after your disappearance. What happened 
to you, dear?&quot; He inquired with a note of worry. 

&quot;I...&quot; Amanda glanced at Maria in search of an answer to give. 

&quot;She was murdered.&quot; Clara declared bluntly, &quot;Just like yourself, our 
daughter and James here. I brought you all brought back to life.&quot; 

&quot;Well, this is an interesting turn of events.&quot; The lord commented, &quot;Lady 
Clara you have been very... busy... I see...&quot; Lord Greystoke remarked, 
slightly uneasy of his wife bringing people back from the dead.

&quot;They are all grand achievements.&quot; Clara announced proudly, &quot;Now shall 
we move on with the formalities and begin to feast?&quot; 

Anita quickly pulled out three chairs for the girls. Maria sat next to 
the teddy bear with Jamie&#39;s body on her opposite side and Amanda at the 
last seat. Amanda smiled at Anita as the maid pushed her seat in. Clara 
sat opposite the girls and watched them attentively, a proud smile upon 
her face. Several servants brought in patters of food and set them about 
the table. Before their eyes a feast appeared as one by one the plates 
were arranged across the table.

&quot;Uhhhh... My lady??&quot; One of the servant stammered and pointed to a group 
of tentacles that had snaked through the door and sat upon a chair a 
couple of places down from Clara. Three tentacle in total, two smaller 
ones coiled around a larger middle stalk, formed an almost plant like 
creature that sat in an &quot;S&quot; shape upon the chair and glanced about the 
many platters that adorned the table.

&quot;No!! Get!!&quot; Clara commanded the creature as if it were a common dog, 
&quot;Shoo. Bad.&quot; 

The middle tentacle split down the middle like a mouth revealing rows of 
tiny shape teeth and it hissed in reply to Clara&#39;s orders. A servant 
tried to move some of the food away from the creature only to be whipped 
upon the hand by one of a smaller tentacle causing him to drop the 
platter to the table. A large piece of ham rolled in front of the 
creature and it began to gnaw at the meat.

Clara sunk into her chair, &quot;Fine, be that way.&quot; She muttered giving a 
wave to the servant to let the creature be. She laced her fingers 
together and glaring at the beast, &quot;But know that tomorrow I will uproot 
you like the bad weed that you are.&quot; She snarled under her breath.

Amanda beamed at the creature, &quot;It does make a rather unique pet.&quot; She 
noted light-heartedly, watching as the creature wrapped a tentacle 
around a wine glass and dumped its contents into an awaiting mouth, 
spilling most of the liquid to the chair and floor, &quot;Rather messy, but 
unique all the same.&quot; 

&quot;Mother, are you sure we have to get rid of it?&quot; Maria inquired feeling 
sorry for the creature.

Jamie ignored the creature as she stared at the table filled with an 
assortment of food and drink. The sight of which made her mouth water 
and she rubbed her paws together in delight. She was still unsure about 
her teddy bear body, but she was going to try everything on the table at 
least once, for this was a feast that she would not miss out on. She 
stood on her chair and was about to reach for a leg of chicken when her 
body reach out for the same. She paused and so did the corpse. 

Maria could not help to giggle, &quot;It would seem your body wants the same 
things as you do, My Lord.&quot; Maria noted in amusement of the situation. 

&quot;This is very fascinating.&quot; Clara stated examining the two carefully as 
Jamie struggled to make her body not move, &quot;It is almost as if you can 
control your body.&quot; She remarked, glancing from the headless corpse to 
the teddy. 

&quot;What is going on?&quot; Lord Greystoke inquired, curious to know what has 
caught everyone&#39;s attention. 

&quot;James here had a rather unfortunate accident and his head was severed 
from his body.&quot; Clara explained calmly as she watched the struggles 
between the two halves, &quot;I placed his brain within a teddy bear&#39;s body, 
thinking the rest of his body would never to be recovered. However the 
body came looking for its head and well...&quot; 

&quot;The body?&quot; The lord seemed very perplexed by this idea, &quot;How can a body 
walk around without a head? And how can you stick a brain in a teddy 
bear?&quot; 

&quot;The teddy bear is a combination of dog parts and animal organs, while 
the body... well that is an intriguing part of the mystery.&quot; Clara 
commented amusement over Jamie&#39;s circumstance. 

Maria sunk in her chair as the two Jamies fought over a piece of meat. 
The teddy standing on the arm of Maria&#39;s chair as it struggled with the 
bit of food, &quot;It is very complicated, father.&quot; She stated, wishing that 
Jamie would find the manners to just sit down and give up the fight. 

&quot;Why does it have to choose everything I do?&quot; Jamie exclaimed suddenly 
letting go of the chicken and switching to a loaf of bread, which was 
snatched up by her body. Then a glass of wine that was immediately 
knocked over, &quot;This is getting maddening. It can not even eat, can it?&quot; 
She inquired watching the corpse try to stick the food down its throat.  

&quot;Jamie?&quot; Lord Greystoke exclaimed abruptly, &quot;Is that you?&quot; He inquired 
curiously, recognizing the girl&#39;s voice. 

Both Jamies flopped into their retrospective chairs and turned to face 
the brain, &quot;Ummm... my lord... that is?&quot; The teddy bear fiddled with her 
tie while her body squirmed in place. 

&quot;Do you know them Lord?&quot; Clara inquired, eyeing Jamie very carefully as 
she lifted a glass of wine to her lips. 

&quot;Of course.&quot; Lord Greystoke stated proudly, &quot;How could I forget my 
favourite paperboy? I did not know you were a Lord?!?&quot; He inquired, even 
more disordered then before.

Clara choked on her wine and coughed, &quot;The Paperboy!?!&quot; She shouted as 
she stood to her feet, &quot;You are not a Lord?!?&quot; She exclaimed perplexed 
by this news. 

Jamie nervously looked around the table as she tried to think of how she 
was going to talk herself out of this new ordeal.  

Maria abruptly stood, &quot;You only assumed that Jamie was a lord. You never 
even thought to ask before renaming her did you?&quot; Maria shot at her 
mother angrily. 

&quot;Maria!&quot; Clara slammed her fist down on the table causing the girl to 
jump, &quot;That is no way to talk to your mother!&quot; She yelled angrily, &quot;You 
are such a disrespectful child. Why can you not be more like Amanda 
there?&quot; 

Amanda sunk in her chair, trying hard to not become apart of a family 
squabble. 

&quot;I am not like Amanda!&quot; Maria exclaimed furiously, &quot;You are always 
comparing to me to every other girl out there. Well I am not like other 
girls.&quot;

&quot;You are a Lady of this manor and you should act that way.&quot; Clara 
returned with equal hostility. 

&quot;Since I am such a disappointment I do not know why you bothered to 
bring me back to life.&quot; Maria returned.

&quot;I brought you back because I love you.&quot; Clara cried out, &quot;I love both 
of you.&quot; She gestured to her husband.

&quot;If you loved me then why do you keep denying the fact that I am 
attracted to women?&quot; Maria stated boldly, glaring at her mother. 

Clara was taken back by this statement, &quot;But I heard from the staff that 
you liked a boy...&quot; Clara remarked warily, &quot;A paper...&quot; She suddenly 
realized whose head she was handed the other day and remembered why it 
seemed familiar, &quot;You are the paperboy!&quot; She declared as if she figured 
it out herself. 

&quot;Jamie is a girl!&quot; Maria exclaimed sharply. 

&quot;A Girl!!!&quot; Lord Greystoke was startled to hear this, &quot;How can this be? 
And you told me that those rumours were lies.&quot; 

&quot;Maria....&quot; Jamie shrunk in her seat as Clara&#39;s eyes bore through her. 
She did not like the way this conversation was going and clung to her 
lover&#39;s arm. 

Even Amanda was cringing in her sit at the rage that was flying over the 
table, &quot;Please do not fight.&quot; Amanda protested dismally, the sight 
reminded her heavily of her own family and the memory upset her. 

&quot;You can not be attracted to women.&quot; Clara declared, &quot;It is unnatura-&quot; 

&quot;We are dead!&quot; Maria cut her mother off with a slam of her hand on the 
table which frightened her mother enough to draw her attention from 
Jamie to her daughter, &quot;How much more unnatural is that? Come on mother 
you study unorthodox science. Why can you not open your eyes for once.&quot; 
She was growing tired of running around the subject and now that she was 
legally dead she felt that the ordinary rules did not apply to her any 
longer. Since no man would come near her the way she now was she was not 
going to give up the girl she loved. 

The tentacle creature applauded Maria&#39;s speech. 

&quot;You stay out of this!!&quot; Clara snarled at the beast only to have it 
growl in response. She then turned back to her daughter, &quot;And as for you 
young lady.&quot; 

&quot;What mother?&quot; Maria glared at her mother with increased intensity. 

&quot;How can you know you love women?&quot; Clara remarked boldly, &quot;You are still 
a virgin!&quot; She exclaimed. Anita quickly backed into a corner of the room 
and tried to hide among the curtains. 

&quot;No I am not!&quot; Maria stated bluntly, &quot;You have been so busy at that lab 
of yours that you never noticed what I was doing and Father here never 
cared what I did so how would you know if I am a virgin or not.&quot; 

&quot;Who was it!?!&quot; Clara screamed across the table in fury, &quot;I will kill 
him.&quot; Her eyes fell upon Jamie, &quot;Or her!&quot; 

&quot;That is none of your business.&quot; Maria replied coldly, &quot;It happened long 
ago... before Jamie.&quot; 

&quot;You have been with more then one woman?&quot; Clara sunk heavily into her 
chair, overwhelmed by what she was hearing, &quot;Why did you not come to us? 
Why did you sneak around behind our backs?&quot; She requested weakly.

&quot;Well, you would not have approved if I told you I wanted to be with a 
paperboy.&quot; Maria remarked coldly, &quot;It would not matter if she was a boy 
or a girl now would it?&quot;

Lord Greystoke finally spoke up, &quot;It is only right that you wed a man of 
noble blood.&quot; He added to the discussion. 

&quot;Well, what noble would want wed a freak like me?&quot; Maria inquired with 
tears in her eyes.  

Amanda almost answered that she would, but the fury burning in Clara&#39;s 
eyes told her that she should really keep out of this argument if she 
wanted to stay in the Greystoke castle any longer. 

Jamie however felt that she needed to speak up, &quot;You are not a freak.&quot; 
She exclaimed, &quot;I will always love you.&quot; She declared proudly. 

Maria picked the teddy bear up, &quot;As I you.&quot; She hugged Jamie, who hugged 
back and the corpse hugged Maria from the other side. 

&quot;That is all fine and good.&quot; Clara watched her daughter carefully, &quot;But 
do not think this conversation is over with so quickly.&quot; All of a 
suddenly hall filled with the sounds of loud pounding, &quot;What could that 
be?&quot; Clara inquired as she got to her feet. 

A servant burst into the room at that moment with the answer, &quot;My... 
lady?!?&quot; She stuttered nervously, &quot;The townsfolk have gathered out front 
and they do not look very pleased.&quot;
