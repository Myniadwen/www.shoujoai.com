<a href="../original/throughdeath-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>      &quot;C&#39;mon, Eveon. It&#39;s not that bad...&quot; Abby whispered soothingly to her daughter lying 
in bed. &quot;But Mommy... What am I going to do without you?&quot; With a sigh, she wiped away her 
daughter&#39;s tears. &quot;Eveon, remember what I told you? If we don&#39;t laugh, we cry. I know this 
isn&#39;t exactly the time I wished to go, but we do have some time left. If nothing else, we 
have to make the most of it, alright?&quot; Eveon nodded reluctantly as Abby kissed her on the 
forehead.

      She exited the room, her heart heavy. Abby would have preferred to kick the bucket 
when Eveon was in college or well off in life... but she didn&#39;t really have a choice, did 
she? Abby was slightly surprised to see Mina at the top of the stairs, dressed in her 
pajamas and clutching a pillow. &quot;Eveon... I can&#39;t really sneak through her window,&quot; Mina 
said with a sad smile. &quot;But I think she needs me.&quot;

      Abby just gave her a hug and walked with her to Eveon&#39;s room. The blonde girl was 
surprised, but visibly happy to see her. As they hugged affectionately on the bed, Abby 
said, &quot;Now, I know you two are sad that I&#39;m not going to be around to see your relationship 
develop... but please, don&#39;t feel pressured to have sex for my sake so I can make naughty 
jokes before I die.&quot;

      Abby luckily shut the door as Eveon chucked her pillow at her. She let a small smile 
grace her lips and felt a familiar presence behind her. &quot;Did you let Mina into the house?&quot; 
she asked as she turned around to face the Living Inferno. He nodded and watched as she 
started walking to her room. &quot;Come with me?&quot; He nodded again.

      They entered her room and she lied down on her bed while he sat in the chair. He 
looked down and saw a bag filled with junk food next to her bed. &quot;What is that food for?&quot; 
Abby looked down at the plastic bag solemnly before pulling random boxes of pastries, 
packages of candy and the occasional six pack of cream soda. She had placed the ice cream in 
the freezer already. &quot;Me and Tycara went to the supermarket together before we saw you. I 
told her to pick out what she wanted and this is it.&quot;

      Abby didn&#39;t realize she was crying until the Living Inferno tenderly wiped the tears 
away with his cool metal hands. &quot;I&#39;m just glad she&#39;ll be okay,&quot; Abby murmured opening one of 
the boxes. She pulled out a package of the cake like treat and opened the plastic wrap. 
&quot;Here,&quot; she murmured, handing one to him, seeing as how they came package in twos. He took 
it and turned around awkwardly. Abby bit into her own and licked the creamy filling off her 
lips.

      Tycara definitely knew how to pick her snacks. Abby listened and heard a clack of 
armor as the Living Inferno removed his mouth guard. She watched as he raised the cake up to 
his face and ate it slowly. Abby took two of the bottles of soda out, but let out a sigh 
when she realized they had old fashioned bottle caps. And she&#39;d have to go back downstairs 
to get a bottle opener...

      The Living Inferno had replaced his mouth guard-armor-thing and look over at the soda 
bottle. Abby laughed as he successfully popped off both caps with his metal hand. Who needed 
a bottle opener when you got the Living Inferno? She briefly wondered if he could also open 
cans... He began to turn back around, but she stopped him by placing her hand on his 
shoulder. &quot;Won&#39;t you show me your face?&quot;

      He took a hesitant breath. &quot;I... think it&#39;s better if I don&#39;t...&quot; She only nodded and 
watched him turn around to remove his mouth armor and drink his cream soda. They were silent 
until two empty glass bottles were resting on her nightstand. &quot;Why is it Tycara whom you 
have to protect?&quot; Abby asked suddenly.

      &quot;...she&#39;s was... is my daughter...&quot; Abby sat up straight and stared at him with wide 
eyes. &quot;Your daughter, but...! Tycara said her mother was raped... so you...?&quot; The Living 
Inferno diverted his gaze. &quot;I do not wish to talk about the situation or what happened, but 
my sin... the one I wish to atone for...&quot; He looked into her eyes. &quot;I was the one who 
murdered Tycara.&quot;

      Abby just looked at him, obviously put off. &quot;You murdered your own eight year old 
daughter...?&quot; He nodded solemnly. &quot;One day... Tycara wandered into the village of the 
angels. She looked like a normal angel child, so they thought nothing of it because it was 
the time of the annual festival... then one angel realized whose daughter she was.&quot; He let 
out a deep sigh. &quot;They... called her a monster and began to beat her. She... Tycara couldn&#39;t 
take it and the unstable power held within her decided to erupt at that moment. When it did, 
she began to unintentionally kill the angels around her.&quot;

      Regardless of Abby&#39;s sad expression, he continued on. &quot;The sheer enormity of her power 
was what caused their deaths. It was out of control so... I...&quot; He stared down at his own 
hands. &quot;There was a knife nearby, on the ground. I knew there was no way to calm her so... I 
pierced her heart once I was close enough. When she started to die, she was surrounded by 
the rest of the angels who were still calling her a monster... they were the monsters and 
that&#39;s why she... that&#39;s why when she came back, she started to murder so many. Tycara&#39;s 
spirit for hundreds of years was kept from moving on and that resentment and anger stayed 
with her.&quot;

      Abby looked down at his hands. &quot;That&#39;s why you&#39;re seeking forgiveness... because you 
killed her. But...&quot; She took his hands in her own. &quot;You didn&#39;t have a choice, did you? You 
did what you thought was right, but now... now you&#39;ve saved her from dying again by 
performing that ritual. It&#39;s alright... I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not angry.&quot; He looked doubtful and 
then Abby said, &quot;Is this why you wear this armor? As some form of punishment?&quot;

      He shook his head. &quot;Yes and no. I couldn&#39;t live with what I did... I just couldn&#39;t. I 
cast myself into Hell and took on this duty, with the hopes of finding some way to be 
forgiven. This armor was cast onto me in Purgatory and because I was alive when I made this 
decision, my life has been forever extended. I can die, but my life stopped the moment I 
committed myself to this.&quot; Abby let out a sigh and stroked his hands. &quot;But you can take this 
armor off, can&#39;t you? Even if your life goes on forever, you don&#39;t have to wear it...&quot;

      He shook his head and squeezed her hands. &quot;It&#39;s better this way,&quot; She looked rather 
doubtful. &quot;...alright. Just remember that you&#39;re using this armor as a shield... as a way to 
keep yourself cut off. You don&#39;t need to do that. What are you afraid of?&quot;

      He looked down at their intertwined hands. &quot;Attachment... intimacy... love... it&#39;s all 
so wonderful, but when you lose it... I&#39;m going to lose you, but I&#39;m already attached.&quot; 

***** 

      It had already been a few days... and a crazy couple of days it had been. Day one, 
they decided to have a backyard summer water party. It was all good and fun... until Faye 
started molesting Erin on the slip &#39;n slide. Everyone else watched awkwardly as the love 
goddess cooed loving phrases into Erin&#39;s ear, all the while reaching into her bikini. The 
slip and slide was soon retired since no one really wanted to go on after that. It didn&#39;t 
help that Isaka convinced Krystal to wear a white shirt and proceeded to chase her blonde 
girlfriend around the backyard with a squirt gun.

      Day two was board games galore since Abby stated that there would be no more awkward 
lesbian touching if it could be helped. Of course, as they were playing Monopoly, Erin was 
suspiciously letting out small noises and no one wanted to look under the table to see where 
Faye&#39;s left hand had gone. Once again, Isaka didn&#39;t help when she threw her hands up in the 
air and claimed that all the awkward tension was leaving her irked. Everyone left at the 
table blushed as Isaka suddenly dragged Krystal to a nearby bedroom and relieved some 
stress. Even the unabashed Faye looked embarrassed.

      On Day three was the great grand chess tournament. Abby decided she wanted to be on 
the winning team so she decided to team up with the Living Inferno. She let him do all the 
thinking. In the end, everyone else teamed up together to try and take him down. They failed 
miserably. Eveon was rather upset that they couldn&#39;t do it, so Mina gave her a reassuring 
kiss. Everyone else then cooed at how cute they were. When the couple retreated to Eveon&#39;s 
room for &#39;privacy&#39;, they all listened carefully to see what they were up to. Faye, of 
course, was curious as to why they weren&#39;t consummating their love yet. That got her a nice 
glare from Abby.

      The next morning, day four, Abby awoke with a long yawn. Today, they were planning a 
barbeque. She felt stranger than usual and meandered to the bathroom. She didn&#39;t want to 
feel strange because feeling strange meant that Tycara was slowly taking over... Abby didn&#39;t 
mind it; she just wanted a little more time. As she looked into her mirror, she realized 
something was off. Abby leaned in to get a closer look of her face.

      Dare she say it, but... did she look... a bit younger? Abby had aged nicely, but she 
swore that she looked a teeny bit younger. Like how she looked when she was 30. Tycara was 
young, so maybe her body was changing to suit that. Abby let out a long sigh and touched the 
mirror. &quot;At least I know you&#39;re there...&quot; she murmured, &quot;I promised to take care of you, so 
don&#39;t worry.&quot;
