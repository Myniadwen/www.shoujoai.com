<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 12 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/artemis-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Gentle hands came up behind Diana to cover up her eyes
as a rich, sexy voice purred in her ear, &quot;Guess who?&quot;

Diana turned, her brown hair flowing then she grinned,
&quot;Herma!&quot;

Hermaphrodite, called by her friends Herma, smiled
back, her short blonde hair styled in a boyish cut
this week, her jeans and T-shirt loose and
comfortable. Only her muscles really spelled out her
dual nature, and that was only in a subtle way.
&quot;You&#39;re still the huntress, I see,&quot; Herma chuckled,
unique violet eyes dancing.

&quot;Always,&quot; Diana agreed. She hooked her arm in the
younger lady&#39;s as they wove through the crowd up to
the bar, &quot;So how&#39;s like in San Francisco?&quot;

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Herma said with a grin, but there was a
flash of pain in her eyes.

Diana fought back a slight flinch. Herma was unique, a
true fusion of male and female, and because of that
she had difficulty in finding a place to fit in. She
was attracted to both genders, which made things even
more complicated, and had the stigma of being
considered bisexual as well.

&quot;Did you have some trouble?&quot; Diana asked, trying not
to feel sorry for her cousin&#39;s sake.

&quot;Just the usual,&quot; Herma said with a casual shrug. She
raised her eyebrows as they reached the bar and saw a
unfamiliar face, &quot;Where&#39;s Circe? Did you finally bring
in help here?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s something like that,&quot; Diana felt a bit of
amusement as Herma boldly checked out her new
bartender head to toe. &quot;This is Descent,&quot; she
introduced her before adding, &quot;and she&#39;s already got a
girlfriend, Herma.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Descent looked more amused by the
cruising than anything else. Her long black hair
flowed over her back and there was a faintly inhuman
cast to her beautiful features, along with an aura of
danger too.

&quot;Charmed,&quot; Herma grinned.

&quot;What can I get you?&quot; Descent turned to pull a beer
bottle out of a fridge, exposing her jean clad bottom
to Herma&#39;s lusty glance.

&quot;Her girlfriend is also a powerful vampire,&quot; Diana
added the warning in a whisper, &quot;behave.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Herma sighed. She smiled as Descent turned
back towards her and answered, &quot;Whisky and water,
please.&quot;

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Descent poured gracefully then
apologetically said as she rushed off, &quot;Sorry, busy
night.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s up?&quot; Herma nodded questioningly towards
Descent as she and Diana moved off to talk a bit more
privately.

Diana took a drink of a cola as she quietly sketched
in what she knew about the woman&#39;s background. &quot;We
were originally just offering her sanctuary,&quot; she
added, &quot;but I think we should hire her full time,
along with her friend Sam.&quot;

Herma nodded, &quot;You two could use the help some
nights.&quot; She frowned slightly, &quot;But aren&#39;t you worried
about making an enemy of the Lady? She may not be a
demon or goddess but she&#39;s very powerful for a
mortal.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t say that doesn&#39;t concern me,&quot; Diana conceded,
&quot;but the Lady has agreed formally to respect the bar&#39;s
territory.&quot; With a faint smile she added impishly, &quot;It
doesn&#39;t hurt that we&#39;re firmly in Jess Drake&#39;s
territory.&quot;

&quot;And how is that old rogue?&quot; Herma asked curiously.

&quot;She&#39;s hurting a little,&quot; Diana surprised her by
saying, &quot;she had a fight with her girlfriend a few
weeks back.&quot;

Herma blinked at her in surprise, &quot;Jess is settling
down? I thought she was &#39;Miss One Night Stand&#39; or
something?!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s trying to be a bit more responsible,&quot; Diana
said with amusement.

&quot;I almost regret the passing of the old Jess,&quot; Herma
mused before adding wickedly, &quot;we even had a one night
stand.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure if I believe that,&quot; Diana looked over at
Herma suspiciously, trying to read her beautiful face.
Her eyes widened suddenly as she remembered something,
&quot;Oh, you should know that Athena is around, too.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Herma blurted, going pale.

&quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s still annoyed about that stunt
you pulled on her years back,&quot; Diana noted, &quot;but I&#39;d
be careful.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m tempted to sneak out,&quot; Herma murmured softly,
shaking her head.

&quot;You have to admit, sending one of your disguised male
acolytes to seduce her was a bad idea,&quot; Diana reminded
her.

&quot;What can I say,&quot; Herma blushed, &quot;I was drunk at the
time.&quot;

Diana looked amused as she remembered, &quot;That&#39;s what
you get for trying to keep up with Dionysis in a
drinking party.&quot;

Herma took a drink, her expression thoughtful as she
changed the subject, &quot;Has there been any word from
Olympus?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; Diana looked grim, &quot;all of Zeus&#39; inner
circle is still there, all apparently unaware of what
Father has become.&quot;

&quot;Wearing freakin&#39; blindfolds,&quot; Herma muttered.

&quot;The Furies escaped, tho,&quot; Diana offered. She smiled
grimly, &quot;They attempted to bring Zeus to justice for
his sins but were defeated, so they fled here.&quot;

&quot;That must have been some fight,&quot; Herma blinked,
imagining the three proto-deities going up against the
lord of Olympus. She studied Diana thoughtfully and
added, &quot;Is that why Zeus took a shot at the place?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Diana agreed, feeling faintly proud of
the bar&#39;s defenses.

&quot;Well,&quot; Herma said, &quot;I&#39;d better scoot before Athena
spots me.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Diana snickered, seeing the figure
quietly coming up behind Herma.

&quot;Herma,&quot; Athena&#39;s voice was a low growl as the
athletic looking blonder warrior glared down at her
from behind.

Herma wheeled around, gulping as she looked up at
Athena. &quot;Ah, hi,&quot; she smiled weakly, &quot;been a long
time, huh?&quot;

&quot;Not long enough,&quot; Athena said dourly. She looked over
at Diana, &quot;How did this idiot get in here, by the
way?&quot;

&quot;She is family,&quot; Diana chided her firmly.

Herma smiled apologetically, &quot;Uhm, about that time...&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Athena said crisply.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Herma answered weakly.

&quot;You know, this butch side of you is new to me,&quot; Diana
mused thoughtfully before adding, &quot;but it&#39;s not
unattractive.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you start,&quot; Athena sighed. She gave Herma a
deadly look, &quot;If you ever try to pull something like
that on me again, I&#39;ll make you regret it eternally.
Got it?&quot;

Herma gulped, knowing that the woman meant it, too. &quot;I
promise,&quot; she vowed.

&quot;So what&#39;s up?&quot; Diana asked curiously.

&quot;I was wondering if I could have the night off
tomorrow,&quot; Athena said with a shrug, &quot;my kendo class
wants to take me out on a movie night.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t be a problem,&quot; Diana reassured her.

&quot;Good,&quot; tossing Herma a glare Athena strode off.

Diana watched her go with a faint smile, &quot;I wonder how
it is she can nurse a grudge so long?&quot;

&quot;Really tough nipples?&quot; Herma quipped. She wilted
under Diana&#39;s look and added, &quot;I know, I know, I won&#39;t
do that in front of her.&quot;

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Diana sighed wryly.</pre>
