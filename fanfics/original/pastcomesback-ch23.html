<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 23 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>      Tsuru had just about had it with Carmilla. &quot;Stop it! That&#39;s enough! All you ever do is 
come around and pretend you know me,&quot; she shouted at the clingy vampire. &quot;Don&#39;t you get it? 
I don&#39;t like you. You turned me into something I never wanted to be and you just want me to 
crawl into your arms?&quot;

      Bakra and Isaka took this time to back away from the pair. Carmilla herself looked too 
stunned to speak.

      &quot;I&#39;m not your knight; I&#39;m not anything of yours. I&#39;m sick and tired of everyone trying 
to domesticate me. Tsuru do this, Tsuru do that... I don&#39;t want to settle down on your 
terms! I want a balanced, equal relationship.&quot;

      Tsuru took in a deep breath, having let it all out.

      &quot;...I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

      The blue haired girl looked shocked at the vampire&#39;s apology. &quot;I never meant to cause 
you so much harm... I guess we, I guess we never realize how fragile people are until we 
hurt them.&quot; Isaka exchanged looks with Bakra. Wasn&#39;t Carmilla... an evil, unremorseful 
vampire?

      Carmilla took Tsuru&#39;s hand into her own. &quot;I just got excited because I think you&#39;re 
very sweet. For the last years I&#39;ve been hunting you down, I kept hearing stories about how 
great you were and all the things you did.&quot; The vampire gave her a toothy grin.

      &quot;...could you please forgive me?&quot; Tsuru was speechless. The vampire did a complete 180 
on her. Now, if only Isaka was this great...

      Tsuru&#39;s face was flushed and she struggled with her words. &quot;Ah... uh, yeah, it&#39;s okay, 
I mean, it&#39;s been so long.&quot; 

      Isaka let out a snort. &quot;Sure, forgive the horny vampire that almost turned you but not 
the demon who saved you from said horny vampire.&quot;

      Tsuru turned around and stuck her tongue out at the demon. &quot;At least she isn&#39;t a 
heartbreaker.&quot;

      The argument would have continued on had they not been attacked by a flurry of 
weapons. Bakra, actually paying attention this time, immediately deflected them all with his 
sword.

      &quot;Look who came, sister!&quot; Hina said and Tsuki&#39;s arm began to glow as seals formed 
around the room.

      &quot;Alright, these girls aren&#39;t easy. The older one uses seals and other such powers 
while the younger uses weapons and spirit threads,&quot; Bakra said to his compatriots.

      Isaka sighed and stretched. &quot;Alright. By all reason, we should split up in case 
trouble rears its ugly head. I can take down the brunette and you can get the blonde Bakra.&quot;

      Tsuru was about to get mad at Isaka for making her go with the vampire, but Tsuki 
began to use an exorcist art she recognized. &quot;Seventh Seal: Cruxis Circle!&quot;

      Isaka and Bakra promptly dodged while the sisters laughed at them. &quot;I&#39;m weapon master 
Hina,&quot; the younger sister said.

      &quot;I&#39;m seal master Tsuki.&quot;

      Isaka rolled her eyes. &quot;And I obviously don&#39;t give a damn.&quot;

      Carmilla laughed and summoned a shadow beast. &quot;Come on Tsuru!&quot; she said, pulling the 
less than eager warrior along for the ride. The giant dragon monster broke through the two 
girls, providing enough time for the vampire and her knight to proceed deeper into the 
destitute shrine.

      &quot;Let&#39;s kick some ass,&quot; Bakra said with a grin. 

***** 

      Tsuru skidded to a halt, causing Carmilla to run into her. She could hear a faint 
jingling. &quot;As a holy exorcist, I, Hoshi, can&#39;t quite let you interrupt.&quot; A woman was 
standing in front of them, Tycara tied up tight behind her.

      &quot;Just hand over Tycara,&quot; Tsuru said, unsheathing her swords. The hybrid was currently 
unconscious.

      &quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that,&quot; Hoshi murmured. &quot;She has the perfect body to become the 
next vessel for our master, the Lord of Demons.&quot;

      Carmilla, gasped dramatically while Tsuru didn&#39;t exactly care what the &#39;Lord of 
Demons&#39; was. &quot;That&#39;s... Tsuru, we can&#39;t let that happen - the Demon Lord is not someone to 
mess with.&quot;

      As if Tsuru couldn&#39;t tell from his name. She drew her weapons and prepared to attack 
the woman, but the room lit up in hidden seals and markings. Carmilla felt a great weight 
and suddenly fell to her knees with a yelp. Tsuru herself could feel the weight on her, 
causing her to slouch.

      Hoshi, however, didn&#39;t really seem to care and went back to working on a complex seal 
around Tycara. &quot;Tsuru... Tsuru, the Demon Lord is a monster born from hell, not like us, who 
were made from tainted human souls,&quot; Carmilla said, her breathing heavy. &quot;If we don&#39;t stop 
him, it could lead to the end of the human world as we know it.&quot;

      &quot;Wh...? But, wouldn&#39;t demons like the Demon Lord?&quot;

      Carmilla shook her head, trying to get up. &quot;No, he&#39;s more ruthless than any demon 
and... only truly twisted ones follow him.&quot;

      Tsuru gave a slight nod, trying to stand up. It took her a little while, but she was 
surprised at how little effect the room&#39;s seal had on her, while Carmilla was practically 
glued to the floor. Hoshi turned around and barely parried with her staff as Tsuru attacked.

      &quot;Wh... you aren&#39;t human, yet you can resist this spell?&quot; Hoshi asked, surprised.

      &quot;I&#39;m not exactly human... I&#39;m not exactly a vampire or a demon, neither,&quot; Tsuru said, 
charging.

      Hoshi blocked each one of her blows with a some effort. Tsuru wasn&#39;t concentrating on 
attacking the woman, but rather on messing up the seal around Tycara and finding a way to 
release Carmilla. If she could do that... well, then Hoshi would be screwed. 

***** 

      Isaka let out a cry as she rocketed to the ground. Bakra gave her a passing glance as 
he swiped at another knife thrown at him. &quot;Do you want to switch?&quot;

      The woman got back up on her feet. &quot;I don&#39;t think it makes a difference at this point 
because they&#39;re so goddamn far away. Their long range attacks are too good.&quot;

      At that the two demon exchanged glances. Bakra grinned and motioned with a tilt of his 
head the direction towards a different room. Isaka began to run, with him behind her.

      Tsuki and Hina watched them in confusion. &quot;What are they doing?&quot; the younger one 
asked.

      Tsuki replied, &quot;Being foolish. Do they really think they can just go around us?&quot;

      Without hesitation the two girls followed, coming to a stop inside the room. It was 
filled with different stone statues. By the time they figured out what was going on, Bakra 
and Isaka attacked. Instinctively, Hina threw out her weapons with her spirit threads and 
froze when they became stuck on the statues. Tsuki seals kept missing as Isaka hid behind 
statues and finally reached her.

      Bakra smacked Hina across the face with the hilt of his sword while Isaka delivered a 
shock of dark energy to Tsuki&#39;s body. Both girls scrambled away.

      &quot;Oh no!&quot; Hina said. &quot;Big sister&#39;s going to be angry.&quot;

      &quot;We don&#39;t have time for this now, we need to help her finish the ritual,&quot; Tsuki 
replied, helping her sister run away. The two girls disappeared, leaving the demons to 
relax...

      ...until they realized what they meant by &quot;ritual&quot;. 

***** 

      &quot;You&#39;re quite good, but not enough!&quot; Tsuru was smacked to the floor by Hoshi, now 
feeling a bit embarrassed. Seriously, two swords and a demon eye versus an exorcist with a 
lame staff? How the hell was she losing? While sitting on her butt, Tsuru finally saw what 
she was looking for.

      Hoshi jumped to the side as Tsuru hurled the blue blade at her. It stuck in the wall 
behind her and the exorcist laughed. &quot;What are you doing? That must have been the most 
foolish-&quot;

      The silver haired woman was cut off as the seal on the whole room dissipated, allowing 
Carmilla to move. As Isaka and Bakra entered the room, Hoshi looked behind her at Tsuru&#39;s 
sword. It had pierced and destroyed the origin of the seal.

      &quot;I think this fight is over,&quot; Carmilla said, with a grin. She sent a shadow beast 
right at Hoshi, its jaws ready to devour her. With a slight frown, Hoshi swung her staff, 
cutting the beast in half. Carmilla gawked and Isaka said, &quot;Damn, so much for that.&quot;

      Bakra pointed his sword at Hoshi. &quot;Give back Tycara, now.&quot;

      The silver haired woman looked between the four of them and smiled. &quot;This is a bit 
unfair don&#39;t you think?&quot;

      &quot;I agree!&quot; came Hina&#39;s cheerful voice from the rafters. The four below her looked up 
just in time to get caught up in all her spirit threads. Bakra almost tripped, Isaka let out 
a hiss as it tightened around her neck, Carmilla found herself trapped on the floor again 
and Tsuru tried to free her bound arms.

      If things could get any worse, they did... Lit up symbols appeared before them and 
Tsuru could only watch as her three companions were forced to the floor of the binding seal. 
&quot;Hmm... too bad we can only use one seal at a time,&quot; Tsuki murmured. &quot;This demon one doesn&#39;t 
work on that girl.&quot;

      The three sisters walked around to look at their captives. Hoshi laughed at their 
predicament. &quot;Well, I guess this is it. The master may not like being welcomed to a bloody 
floor, but I doubt he&#39;ll mind.&quot; She let one hand touch Hina&#39;s hair affectionately while 
Tsuki leaned into her older sister.

      The group all exchanged looks, Bakra obviously being the most uncomfortable with the 
implications. &quot;I guess we get a show before our death,&quot; Tsuru murmured out.

      &quot;Yuck, you can&#39;t seriously be screwing your sisters!&quot; Isaka shouted only to get a 
confused look from Bakra.

      &quot;But didn&#39;t you fall in love with your sister?!&quot;

      &quot;Shut up - I was adopted! That doesn&#39;t count!&quot;

      Hoshi just gave them a small smile. &quot;Oh, you just don&#39;t understand at all. There&#39;s 
nothing wrong with keeping my sisters entertained, right?&quot;

      The two other girls giggled and Tsuru shuddered. How... ugh. This was nothing like the 
feelings she had for other women. This was so vile and wrong... to imagine Hoshi actually 
doing that to her sisters! She tried to struggle against her bounds when Carmilla leaned her 
face close to hers. They were almost kissing.

      &quot;Tsuru,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You aren&#39;t affected by the binding seal so you&#39;re our only 
hope. Drink my blood.&quot;

      Tsuru tensed up and looked deep into those red eyes. Carmilla was being serious. 
&quot;Why?&quot; she hissed out. &quot;I don&#39;t want to-&quot;

      &quot;You won&#39;t turn into a full vampire - but if you drink my blood you&#39;ll gain temporary 
power to win.&quot; Tsuru looked over at the three sisters, who were currently getting a little 
to touchy feely with each other. Luckily, Isaka and Bakra caught on to their conversation 
and were working on distracting the sisters.

      &quot;Do you... do you really sleep with each other?&quot; The purple eyed demon asked.

      Instead of being embarrassed, Hoshi said, &quot;Well, since you&#39;re going to die... We can 
only do a bit of innocent touching. If I bring my sisters to a full... release... then they 
won&#39;t be so useful to the master.&quot;

      Hina gave her a large grin. &quot;But we can have as much fun as we want with big sister!&quot;

      &quot;Even if we can&#39;t be complete, at least big sister still takes care of us,&quot; Tsuki 
added.

      Tsuru wanted the sex talk to end and she could hear Carmilla&#39;s delicious pulse. It was 
calling out to her... Carmilla let out a small sigh as a warm mouth latched onto her neck. 
The vampire would be lying if she said it wasn&#39;t pleasurable to have Tsuru&#39;s teeth pierce 
her skin. She began to drink deeply, eyes closing at the unique taste entering her mouth.

      She began to break from the threads and held Carmilla more closely. It was too good to 
let go and the vampire was whimpering in her arms. Isaka spied a look at the two of them.

      &quot;Is Carmilla getting off on Tsuru drinking her blood?&quot;

      &quot;I wish eating was that exciting,&quot; Bakra responded.

      By the time Hoshi noticed, Tsuru was already free. Tsuki tried to cast a seal, but the 
blue haired girl was too fast. Instead, she was pierced by the many knives Hina threw at 
her. She pulled them out of her body as she tackled Tsuki to the ground.

      The young girl let out a cry as Tsuru in her blood lust bit into her neck. As she 
drank the essence of the brunette, the seal around her three companions dropped. Hina tried 
to tightened her spirit threads, but Isaka was able to counteract them with enough dark 
energy. Bakra went after the girl who quickly brandished a knife to block his strike.

      Isaka went over to free Tycara as Hoshi quickly cast a seal on Tsuru, &quot;Heaven Art: 
Final Retribution!&quot;

      Tsuru didn&#39;t even jerk up her head as the high level art created a great burst of 
light that entered her body before exploding. Hoshi quickly pulled Tsuki away, eyeing her 
neck wound with worry. However, Tsuru merely absorbed the blow, it having no effect on her.

      &quot;Just what the hell are you?!&quot; The silver haired woman asked, only to be confronted by 
confused eyes, still hungry. Hoshi didn&#39;t have anytime to react before Hina suffered a cut 
on her arm. The blonde girl fell back against her big sister.

      Tsuru gritted her teeth. &quot;More,&quot; she murmured out. &quot;If you don&#39;t leave... I will take 
as much as I can.&quot;

      Hoshi, not liking her odds proceeded to cast a distraction spell. The whole chamber 
burst into light as the three sisters disappeared. Tycara let out a sharp breath once she 
was freed. Bakra helped her stand up as Isaka went over to Tsuru.

      The blue haired girl was on her hands and knees, letting out labored breaths. &quot;I&#39;m 
still... so hungry...&quot; she whispered to Isaka, almost crying.

      Carmilla, who had been recovering from the blood loss, came to the girl&#39;s side. 
&quot;Here,&quot; she said, motioning to her neck. &quot;You can have as much as you like-&quot;

      Tsuru shook her head furiously and swatted away the hand Carmilla was holding out to 
her. &quot;No... no I don&#39;t want it! I just... if I do, I won&#39;t be able to stop,&quot; Tsuru breathed 
out, furiously wiping at the blood staining her lips.

      Carmilla frowned. &quot;So you&#39;re just going to starve yourself? Tsuru - you can have 
inhuman capabilities if you just nourish them with a regular supply of blood. You can do 
more good-&quot;

      &quot;But where would it stop?&quot; She asked, getting up. Tsuru began to hurriedly grab her 
weapons. &quot;I don&#39;t want this. You and I... Carmilla I don&#39;t want to be bound to you like 
this.&quot; 

      The vampire stood up. &quot;That&#39;s not what this is about! I want you to be with me, but I 
also want you to be as good as you can. I can give you all that you need, if you just let 
me.&quot;

      Tsuru shook her head again. &quot;I don&#39;t want any offerings... I don&#39;t need it, I can do 
fine on my own.&quot; She looked over at Tycara. &quot;I... will come visit another time, okay?&quot;

      The white haired girl wanted to say something, but didn&#39;t. Tycara could see the pain 
in Tsuru&#39;s eyes as well as disgust at herself. The blue haired girl got a small smile and 
nod from Bakra, but only a frown from Isaka.

      &quot;What the hell is your problem?&quot; the demon asked. &quot;You have someone here ready to 
devote herself to you, but then you refuse her?&quot;

      Tsuru glared at Isaka. &quot;Can&#39;t you see that isn&#39;t what I want? Why would I want to be 
somebody&#39;s little servant, rather than their equal?&quot; Her gaze softened as she looked over at 
Carmilla. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I know we can&#39;t be together as lovers.&quot;

      With that, Tsuru walked out of the room, only to have Carmilla run after her. &quot;Wait, 
Tsuru! Give me a chance!&quot;

      Carmilla&#39;s voice faded down the hall and Bakra let out a sigh. Isaka rolled her eyes 
and began to guide Tycara out of the room. &quot;Do you think Tsuru will be alright?&quot;

      &quot;Hell, if she complains about being lonely again, I&#39;m going to smack her upside the 
head.&quot;

      Bakra watched them leave then took a quick glance around the room. Those sisters had 
been planning for a long time... Their &#39;master&#39;, huh? He walked after the two women, still 
worried.
