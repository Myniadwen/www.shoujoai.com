<a href="../original/testfire-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Jack Scott looked around the lobby of the Woodwards
building warily, her sandy brown hair falling neatly
away from her face. Still holding her pistol in the
ready position she looked back at Motoko to ask, &quot;Are
you all right?&quot;

&quot;Just a little shaken,&quot; Motoko Fitzgerald admitted.
The Asian redhead looked at Jack warily, &quot;Do you
really think that was just a warning?&quot;

Jack lead the way over to the stairs, looking inside
cautiously before waving Motoko to accompany her into
the stairwell. &quot;I think if they did hit you it
wouldn&#39;t have bothered them very much,&quot; she said
honestly, &quot;but I&#39;m sure the first shot was a
deliberate miss.&quot;

&quot;To scare me,&quot; Motoko murmured, &quot;or someone connected
to me.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Jack agreed as they headed up the stairs
while she was also keeping a eye on the levels up
above them

&quot;That kind of contempt for life disgusts me,&quot; Motoko
said with a frown.

&#39;Not the sort of comment that I&#39;d expect from someone
like her,&#39; Jack thought. They reached the right floor
and Jack silently pushed the door open, looking both
ways down the darkened hallway for any sign of
intruders. &quot;Maybe so,&quot; she said as they went out into
the hall, &quot;but for more than one person in the city
that&#39;s how the game is played.&quot;

&quot;Like the Shogun or Davidson?&quot; Motoko asked shrewdly,
following close.

&#39;More like me and my type,&#39; Jack thought to herself
grimly as they reached her office. &quot;No,&quot; she shook her
head, &quot;the Shogun has honor, much like his men.&quot; She
unlocked the door, then looked around inside before
letting Motoko go on in.

Motoko reached for the light switch only to have Jack
gently reach out to stop her hand. &quot;Why...?&quot; she
frowned.

Jack smiled slightly as she murmured, &quot;I just want to
check something.&quot; Like a ghost Jack slid over to stand
by the window, carefully keeping herself out of line
of sight even as she scanned the street below them for
watchers. &#39;No sign,&#39; she thought, &#39;which means there&#39;s
no one there or they&#39;re better at this than I am.&#39;

&quot;May I?&quot; Motoko asked, hand still resting on the
switch.

&quot;Please do,&quot; Jack smiled and Motoko switched on the
lights even as Jack returned to the door and locked it
behind them.

The little office was just as she had left it, and
Motoko looked around with a faint frown. Still, she
sat down in one of the guest chairs even as Jack
quickly kicked off her dress shoes with a happy sigh.
&quot;They aren&#39;t that uncomfortable, are they?&quot; she asked
mildly.

&quot;I don&#39;t wear them very often,&quot; was Jack&#39;s wry reply.
Reaching up she pulled off her earrings, setting the
clip ons down on top of her desk. Wiggling bare feet
in the slightly dusty carpet she continued, &quot;I need to
get changed, would you mind joining me?&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Motoko blinked, looking at the other woman in
surprise.

&quot;I am your bodyguard,&quot; Jack shrugged slightly, &quot;and at
this point I&#39;d feel uncomfortable letting you out of
my sight.&quot;

&quot;If you feel it&#39;s necessary,&quot; Motoko said with a sigh,
&quot;of course.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jack flashed her most charming grin.

They went through the office and into Jack&#39;s quarters
where she grabbed a fresh pair of blue jeans and a
nice white blouse from her half-open closet, laying
them out on the arm of her couch. With a single
graceful gesture she pulled the dress up and then off,
wearing only her panties beneath then folding the
dress up efficiently and dressing as quickly as
possible.

Motoko had a faintly scandalized look on her face and
Jack sighed, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting you to be so... efficient,&quot; Motoko
murmured.

Jack was pretty sure that counted as a insult, at
least coming from the graceful and elegant woman who
was standing nearby. &#39;Probably makes a production out
of getting out of the bed in the morning,&#39; she thought
with faint amusement..

&quot;Are we going to be staying here?&quot; Motoko asked after
a moment.

Jack sat down on the couch, glad that there wasn&#39;t too
much dust this time. &quot;Grab a seat,&quot; she waved then
answered, &quot;I don&#39;t know, do you think they know where
you live?&quot;

Motoko frowned at the dusty cloth of the couch and sat
down. She thought about it then conceded, &quot;It&#39;s
possible.&quot;

&quot;We can try to make a run somewhere else,&quot; Jack leaned
forward slightly, :&quot;but there&#39;s a degree of danger in
moving you, as well as no guarantee you&#39;d be safe in
the new location.&quot;

&quot;But is here safe?&quot; Motoko asked softly.

&quot;That&#39;s the question,&quot; Jack agreed, &quot;they knew to
launch a attack outside of the building, but I don&#39;t
think they know the inside yet.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t sound that confident,&quot; Motoko said
perceptively.

Jack flashed a smile, &quot;Which is why I plan to stay up
tonight, just in case. And I&#39;m calling in a favor or
two, as well.&quot; She got up, stretching, &quot;I&#39;ll fold out
the bed for you....&quot;

Motoko got up, looking dubiously as Jack folded out
the hideabed, getting blankets out of a shelving unit
nearby. &quot;How... quaint,&quot; Motoko said faintly.

Jack tried not to laugh at the look at her face. &quot;Have
a good rest,&quot; she went out to her office, picking up
the phone and dialing.

&quot;What the hell d&#39;you want?&quot; Max Clark&#39;s voice came
through, sounding a bit sleepy.

&quot;Good evening Max,&quot; Jack said cheerfully.

&quot;It&#39;s past midnight,&quot; Max growled out irritably. He
took a deep breath then asked sourly, &quot;What do you
want, Scott?&quot;

&quot;How would you like to earn a few extra marks?&quot; Jack
asked, then quietly sketched in what she wanted him to
do.

&quot;Not too dangerous sounding,&quot; Max mused, &quot;go up to
your building, scout around outside a bit and then
report back.&quot;

&quot;These guys are armed,&quot; Jack cautioned him, &quot;don&#39;t
forget that.&quot;

&quot;Why Jack, I didn&#39;t know you cared,&quot; Max sounded
amused. More seriously he continued, &quot;I handled worse
shit back at Fort Langley, you know.&quot;

&quot;True enough, old man,&quot; Jack agreed. &quot;So. you&#39;re in?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Max agreed, &quot;I walk up, scout around then
phone back in a hour or so.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Jack wished him.

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Max signed off.

Jack got up, stretching out as she stood in the
office. Quietly she opened the door to the suite,
looking in to see that Motoko seemed to be fast asleep
on the fold out bed. She looked younger, somehow, and
far less cynical than she had seemed while awake.

&#39;Wonder if Davidson is really dealing with who&#39;s
threatening them?&#39; Jack wondered. She jerked as there
was a soft knock on the office door and quickly
turned, gun at the ready.

&quot;Jack, are you home?&quot; Heather&#39;s soft voice called.

Jack fought the urge to curse. She unlocked the office
door and waved Heather in, scanning the hall fast to
make sure she wasn&#39;t followed. &quot;This isn&#39;t the safest
place to be,&quot; Jack turned to say to Heather with a
frown.

&quot;You could say that about most of this city,&quot; Heather
answered, her glossy black hair flowing down her back.
She sighed, &quot;You&#39;re bodyguarding Motoko?&quot;

Jack raised an eyebrow, &quot;And how do you know about
that?&quot;

&quot;I was one of the ones that found her after the
attack,&quot; Heather explained softly. She hesitated a
moment, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Jack felt her shoulders tense.

&quot;For not telling you about my being a hostess at the
Nightingale,&quot; Heather said softly. She took a breath,
&quot;I started up there after you left town, Jack, when
none of us were sure that you were even coming back.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s none of my business,&quot; Jack said firmly.

Heather put her hand on Jack&#39;s arm, looking up into
her eyes as she gently asked, &quot;Isn&#39;t it?&quot;
