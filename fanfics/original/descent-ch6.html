<a href="../original/descent-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        Nocturne reached out, the brown haired vampiress gently pushing 
the black mane of hair from her lover&#39;s face. &quot;You are being hunted?&quot; 
she asked softly.

        They lay together naked on the large bed, two pale, sweaty 
bodies entangled on the satin sheets. It had been a most enjoyable 
night, Descent applying the many things that Nocturne taught to her and 
having those same things used on her. The slight chill to the vampiress&#39; 
skin only added a certain eroticism to the experience, going well with 
the fires that burned in Descent.

        &quot;A priest carrying guns,&quot; Descent sighed softly. She smiled 
wryly, &quot;I heard about it through Lisa, actually, it seems the priest was 
asking about my driving the pimps off.&quot;

        &quot;Do you need help?&quot; Nocturne asked softly.

        Descent looked over at her, feeling a flash of surprise that she 
kept well hidden. They had been meeting like this for the past few 
weeks, spending nights together then going their separate ways once the 
daylight came. She had told her some about her past, her demonic nature, 
and in exchange Nocturne had spoken of her own becoming a vampire. 
Still, they were strangers in many ways and the offer of help was 
unexpected.

        &quot;No,&quot; Descent finally said to her softly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to 
put you in danger.&quot; Nocturne was about to say something and she leaned 
forward to kiss her, &quot;My intention to battle Lady Diana is the source of 
this threat, I&#39;m sure of it.&quot;

        &quot;Lady Diana and a priest don&#39;t normally go together,&quot; Nocturne 
noted. The elegant vampire sighed softly, &quot;Though the coincidence is a 
bit much.&quot;

        &quot;That was my thought,&quot; Descent agreed. She smiled wryly, &quot;But 
for whatever reason she pursues me, so I guess I have to go see her.&quot;

        Nocturne looked startled, &quot;Is that wise?&quot;

        &quot;Maybe not,&quot; Descent quietly agreed, &quot;but I can&#39;t see a real 
priest working for Lady Diana knowingly. So either she&#39;s a hitwoman with 
a serious priest fixation or she&#39;s being manipulated.&quot; A grim little 
smile, &quot;I can deal with the first or reason with the second as the case 
may be.&quot;

        &quot;I can&#39;t talk you into hiding in our home for a few weeks?&quot; 
Nocturne asked softly.

        &quot;As pleasing as that sounds,&quot; Descent sighed, &quot;I dislike running 
away.&quot;

        &quot;Then let me make this an evening for you to remember,&quot; Nocturne 
startled her by suddenly rolling Descent onto her back. She smiled down 
at the pale skinned demoness, &quot;There&#39;s a few tricks I&#39;ve yet to show 
you, little one.&quot;

        Descent moaned softly as gentle fingers brushed down her neck, 
finding nipples already painfully hard. &quot;I love surprises,&quot; she managed 
to gasp, fangs gently raking across her nipples.

        &quot;You haven&#39;t seen anything yet,&quot; Nocturne chuckled, her gentle 
touch soon bringing forth soft cries of pleasure from her companion...

        The dawn was just coming as Descent strode down the hall with 
the maid, dressed in her typical jeans and black T-shirt. &quot;I made sure 
that she was safely abed before I left, Natasha,&quot; Descent said to her 
softly.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Natasha smiled slightly, then her expression became 
somewhat grave. Softly she asked, &quot;Did my Lady Nocturne ask you...&quot;

        &quot;She offered me her help, yes,&quot; Descent said calmly before 
softly adding, &quot;I had to turn Nocturne down, though.&quot;

        Natasha looked visibly surprised, stopping the two of them in 
the middle of the ornately decorated hallway. &quot;A killer pursues you,&quot; 
she said to Descent softly, her long brown hair flowing down her back, 
&quot;and you turn down help?&quot;

        Descent sighed softly, &quot;This is my fight, I don&#39;t want to pull 
any others into it.&quot; She looked up to meet Natasha&#39;s eyes, &quot;And I know 
how vulnerable they can be, in some ways. I don&#39;t want to see either 
Nocturne or Dominique harmed or killed.&quot;

        Natasha&#39;s eyes seemed to soften slightly, then she smiled.

        &quot;What?&quot; Descent frowned.

        &quot;You care about them,&quot; Natasha said softly, wonder in her voice 
as she continued, &quot;that is a most rare and precious gift.&quot; She started 
walking towards the exit, and Descent hastened to follow.

        &quot;Of course I care about Nocturne,&quot; Descent softly protested, &quot;I 
wouldn&#39;t be sleeping with her if I didn&#39;t. Why does that surprise you?&quot;

        &quot;It makes me glad,&quot; Natasha corrected her, a bit of regret in 
her voice.

        &quot;You love them both, don&#39;t you?&quot; Descent asked her softly, the 
two women hesitating a moment by the outside door.

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Natasha said. She flashed a sudden smile, &quot;And 
nothing makes me happier than seeing both of them happy.&quot; With that she 
gently pushed Descent outside, putting something in her hand as Natasha 
shut the door firmly.

        Descent pulled her long jacket around her as the sun rose above 
the buildings, slipping the envelope of money into her pocket with a 
sigh. She had tried to argue with Nocturne about that, but the vampiress 
was firm. It seemed that she wanted to assist Descent in some way, and 
her wealth made such a gesture easy.

        &#39;Well, to work,&#39; Descent thought, striding down the street. Her 
hunter was sticking to the same part of town that was her territory, and 
finding her would hopefully be easy. She rather suspected that gunshots 
or violence would follow in the woman&#39;s wake.

        &#39;And then there&#39;s the other thing,&#39; she mused grimly. There had 
been several rumors of a child slavery ring operating in the city, but 
nothing concrete. Recently Descent was offered information that might 
lead her to them, if it was legitimate. &#39;Or it might be a trap,&#39; Descent 
mused.

        The city streets were quiet as Descent walked on, checking in 
with contacts and informants. The working girls, rent boys, street 
people, they all knew her by now. Their trust had been slow coming, but 
her obvious concern with their welfare had shone through, winning them 
over one at a time. All had seen the intense female priest, but other 
than that they knew little.

        The black haired young woman stalked the empty streets as the 
sun rose up into the sky, then began to descend behind the tall 
buildings. A striking figure, black coat and pale skin making her a bold 
and intense figure. Finally, the faint sound of gunfire drew her to a 
darkened alley.

        Gazing down from a nearby roof she witnessed a pitched battle. 
Lady Diana&#39;s footsoldiers had their weapons up, guns blazing as they 
fought against the rival Asian gangsters. Men and women dropped on both 
sides and Descent felt the inhuman fury rising in her, her form shifting 
slightly, revealing her demonic aspect.

        &quot;Stop,&quot; Descent cried out, leaping down from the concealment of 
the rooftop and into the midst of the gangsters. She flung figures 
aside, jumping into Lady Diana&#39;s people before they could take advantage 
of the distraction she represented.

        Then her shoulder exploded in blood and flame.

        She walked out of the shadows as the gangsters scattered, 
fleeing the demoness. Her black garb blended her into the shadows, the 
white cleric&#39;s collar shining into the darkness. Brown hair was pulled 
back in a simple ponytail, her face intense. Twin guns shone silver in 
her hands, a bit of smoke curling up from one of them.

        Descent reached for her shoulder, hissing softly as she made 
herself dig into the torn flesh. With a gasp she grasped the bullet, 
pulling it free and letting it clatter to the pavement. Still clutching 
her injured shoulder she looked at the priest, &quot;What do you want?&quot;

        The priest had a dumbfounded expression on her handsome face, so 
shocked that Descent thought she might faint. &quot;Those bullets are 
blessed, formed from a silver cross,&quot; she said softly, &quot;you should be 
dead, demon, not just injured.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not quite typical,&quot; Descent said, pulling her hand from her 
now nearly healed shoulder wound. &quot;I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re after me, but 
I&#39;m not your enemy,&quot; she said simply.

        &quot;That&#39;s not what the church says,&quot; the priest answered calmly, 
keeping her pistols leveled at Descent&#39;s chest.

        Descent met the woman&#39;s eyes, trying to read her intentions. She 
spread her arms wide, making herself an easy target as she said, &quot;I have 
no intention of hurting you. I entered this battle to stem the 
bloodshed, not increase it.&quot;

        The breeze picked up, the scent of incense and gunpowder carried 
in the air, the woman&#39;s ponytail blowing sideways. She finally raised 
the guns, studying Descent. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on here,&quot; she 
said carefully, &quot;but whatever it is, I don&#39;t like it.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d love to stick around,&quot; Descent said, &quot;but there&#39;s a 
shipment of slaves going out of the docks tonight. I intend to stop 
them.&quot;

        The brown haired woman&#39;s eyes narrowed as she heard the word 
slaves. &quot;Would you like some assistance with that?&quot; she asked mildly.

        &quot;It might be useful,&quot; Descent agreed. She looked at the priest 
thoughtfully, &quot;What do I call you, anyway?&quot;

        &quot;Samantha Teresa,&quot; she said calmly, and with that both women 
walked off into the shadows, watching each other warily.</pre>
