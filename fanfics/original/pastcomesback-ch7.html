<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>      Krystal could successfully say that the bathing with the three sisters had been the 
most awkward moment of her life - even more than the phone sex.

      &quot;Alright, try the Flare Seal again. Focus on a more explosive power, okay?&quot; Krystal 
nodded at Hoshi&#39;s instructions and tried it again. Her holy power erupted into almost 
flames, much more perfect than the last time.

      The blonde sat back and let out a long breath. &quot;You&#39;re doing really well,&quot; Hoshi said. 
&quot;You&#39;re learning things that took us weeks.&quot;

      She looked over at her sisters. Hina seemed perfectly jolly, but Tsuki didn&#39;t look so 
good. The brunette was paler than normal and was shaking slightly. &quot;Tsuki,&quot; the eldest 
sister asked. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

      Tsuki turned to her sister and gave a weak smile. &quot;I... haven&#39;t been feeling well. 
That&#39;s all.&quot; She looked down at her hands. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to rest...&quot; She crawled over 
to her sleeping bag and lied down.

      Hina, worried, went over to her sister. As the little girl tried to see if Tsuki was 
okay, Hoshi turned to Krystal. &quot;Maybe we should retire as well. Last thing we would want is 
to send you home sick,&quot; she said, with a secret little smile. &quot;We wouldn&#39;t want your 
girlfriend to hate us now, would we?&quot;

      Krystal froze on the spot, blushing. &quot;Wait... wait, how-&quot;

      Hoshi just laughed and walked over to her sisters. Krystal wasn&#39;t sure how she&#39;d 
picked up on her sexuality... was it the way she reacted in the spring? The blonde woman let 
out a sigh and headed to her own pile of blankets. Hina insisted they make this as much of a 
sleepover as possible...

      Speaking of which, as Hoshi turned out the lights, Hina curled up to Tsuki. The silver 
haired woman soon did the same. Krystal found it heartwarming for them to be so close and 
loving. Hoshi put a hand to Tsuki&#39;s forehead and whispered something in the brunette&#39;s ear. 
She only gave a weak nod before dozing off.

      Krystal curled up and went to sleep. 

***** 

      As much as she enjoyed training and having awkward moments with the three girls, she 
decided to take the day off. When she got up that morning, it was Hoshi and Hina making 
breakfast, with Tsuki sitting at the table, wrapped in a blanket. The girl still seemed ill. 
&quot;Good morning,&quot; she said weakly.

      &quot;Morning. Are you still sick?&quot; Tsuki nodded. Hina came to the table and set down a 
bowl of soup.

      &quot;This should be nice and good for you, Tsuki! Big sister&#39;s making pancakes for us, 
Krystal.&quot; As soon as Hina said that, Hoshi came over with a plate of pancakes, fruit and 
syrup.

      As they all sat down, Hoshi asked, &quot;Will you be leaving us for a few days?&quot; Krystal 
paused in the middle of eating her food.

      &quot;Only for about two days. I think I need a break... not that I don&#39;t like it here.&quot; At 
her words, the three girls broke out into laughter.

      &quot;Ah, that&#39;s perfectly fine. We can&#39;t wait for you to come back though,&quot; Hina said 
before chugging on a glass of milk. Hoshi reached over and pulled away the glass, trying to 
keep her little sister from choking. Tsuki quietly ate her soup, looking quite 
uncomfortable.

      When the young woman finished, she excused herself from the table to go lie down. 
&quot;I&#39;ll probably have to go pay her a visit,&quot; Hoshi murmured, absent mindedly. 

***** 

      When Krystal arrived home, she looked around for Isaka. She was expecting the demon to 
pounce on her again, but she wasn&#39;t in sight. The blonde set down her clothes and her sword 
before heading down the hallway.

      She opened the door without hesitation, unsurprised to be yanked into a warm embrace 
by the demon on the other side. &quot;Hello,&quot; purred out a voice. &quot;How nice of you to show up.&quot;

      Krystal received a warm kiss and laughed at Isaka&#39;s actions. &quot;Of course I showed up, 
silly. I promised, didn&#39;t I?&quot; Her girlfriend led her over to the bed where they 
unceremoniously tumbled down on the sheets.

      &quot;Didn&#39;t you want me to wear something special?&quot; Krystal asked as her shirt was being 
pulled over her head.

      &quot;Hmmm... no time for that now - I love the wrapping, but the present is still the best 
part,&quot; Isaka said, tugging at Krystal&#39;s pants. &quot;How was your overnight training?&quot;

      &quot;Um, kind of weird. I did learn a bunch of new things, but one of the girls got sick.&quot; 
Krystal helped Isaka out of her clothe s before hugging her tightly. &quot;It&#39;s kind of odd to be 
doing this in the afternoon...&quot;

      Isaka just ignored her and started nibbling on her neck. The long, languid motions of 
her tongue made her weak and Krystal could only stroke the demon&#39;s head. &quot;I don&#39;t 
particularly care for the time of the day,&quot; she said, giving Krystal a kiss. &quot;It&#39;s just you 
that matters.&quot;

      The demon&#39;s hands roamed all over her body, making Krystal shudder. It was so nice to 
be with Isaka again... She felt those same hands go around her back to unclasp her bra. 

***** 

      Isaka was content to be curled up naked against Krystal. Sure, it was the afternoon 
now, but it was a nice time for a nap... especially after love making. She deviously nipped 
at Krystal&#39;s ear, making the exorcist moan and fidget. She was still asleep.

      The demon was about to go to sleep as well, her head against Krystal&#39;s chest when the 
young woman&#39;s phone went off again. She growled and pulled her girlfriend tighter. At least 
the phone hadn&#39;t gone off when they were having sex... that would have pissed her off really 
bad. Krystal curled up closer to her, as though trying to ignore the ringtone.

      Isaka reached over her to get the phone on the nightstand, flipping it open. She 
answered with a tired, &quot;Hello?&quot;

      There was silence, almost like surprise on the other line. &quot;Uh... hi? Is Krystal 
there?&quot; Isaka looked down at her girlfriend, sleeping soundly, her nude body pressed up 
against her own.

      &quot;Yeah,&quot; Isaka murmured. &quot;She&#39;s taking a nap. Do you want to leave a message?&quot;

      &quot;Yes,&quot; the scared little voice said. &quot;Um, I wanted to know if she could hang out later 
today... at the park at, uh 4:00?&quot;

      Isaka let a little smile light up on her face. So this was the girl that Krystal met 
up with... the demon resisted the urge to laugh. &quot;Of course. I&#39;ll let her know when she 
wakes up, okay?&quot; 

***** 

      Non date number 2. Tsuru really needed to get a life, but she was content with walking 
around downtown with Krystal - it was almost as good as having her as a girlfriend. Almost. 
Then again, she was always reminded of the voice that answer Krystal&#39;s phone, the voice that 
belonged to Krystal&#39;s lover.

      Lucky girl... Krystal looked over at a food stand and back at Tsuru. &quot;Hey, are you 
thirsty?&quot;

      &quot;Huh? Oh, yeah,&quot; the blue haired girl replied.

      &quot;I&#39;ll go grab us something and you wait here, alright?&quot; Tsuru was about to protest and 
offer to pay for it, but Krystal was already gone. She could see her across the street, 
waiting in line to order drinks. Tsuru let out a sigh, standing there patiently.

      For a moment, she felt a shiver run up her spine and a feeling of dread... was 
there... another demon nearby? Tsuru dismissed it as nerves and decided to look around.

      And that was when it happened. She caught a glimpse of a young woman she hadn&#39;t seen 
in years. Tsuru paled and turned away. It couldn&#39;t be her, could it? She was only a few 
yards away and if she were to turn, she would see Tsuru.

      Crap. The blue haired girl tried to think of a way out, but she could just leave - 
Krystal would wonder where the hell she went! Maybe she could hide in a bathroom? Then 
again, she was doomed. She was a light blue haired girl with bandages on her right eye. How 
the hell wouldn&#39;t she get noticed by someone?!

      Out of her peripheral vision, the one person she hated, despised and was terrified of 
ever meeting again decided to turn her head.

      &quot;...Tsuru...?&quot; she heard the shocked and surprised voice. Tsuru tensed up as she heard 
footsteps come nearer. &quot;Tsuru?&quot; she heard again, the voice much more sure of her presence.

      It had been such a long time since they last met... Tsuru made sure of it. &quot;It is 
you... Tsuru. It&#39;s been so long,&quot; the woman said, mirth evident in her voice. Why did she 
always do that? Why did she always sound so damn happy?!

      &quot;I&#39;m glad we could meet up again-&quot;

      &quot;Glad? Glad?! I sure as hell am not glad! I would appreciate it if you would leave me 
alone,&quot; Tsuru hissed out, anxious for Krystal&#39;s arrival. Krystal. If the other woman saw 
Krystal, than the blonde would be in danger of her lecherous ways.

      &quot;Don&#39;t be like that. I know we ended on a bad note last time, but you can&#39;t exactly 
swear me off,&quot; she replied.

      As if on cue, Krystal arrived holding to cups. &quot;Here you go, Tsuru. I got you 
lemonade.&quot; Tsuru could see the surprised look on her rival&#39;s face. Krystal turned to the 
other woman and looked just as surprised.

      &quot;Krystal,&quot; Tsuru said, holding onto the girl. &quot;Get behind me, this woman is-&quot;

      Before the blue haired girl could finish, Krystal smiled happily at the stranger 
before giving her a big kiss on the lips. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

      Tsuru froze, for now it was her turn to be surprised. Krystal grabbed the hand of her 
enemy before facing the blue haired beauty. &quot;Tsuru, I&#39;d like you to meet my girlfriend, 
Isaka.&quot;

      The demon grinned again. &quot;Oh, we&#39;ve already met.&quot;

      In that moment, Tsuru&#39;s world shattered.
