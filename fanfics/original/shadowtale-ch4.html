<h1>A Shadowlander's Tale: One's Purpose (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowtale-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Kai glided upon the winds. She spread her wings out wide and soared high 
into the air. She never felt so free in her entire life. She felt that 
she could stay up in the clouds forever. &#145;Is this why Anita liked to 
float around.&#39; She reflected. It was so peaceful as she let the winds 
carry her higher into the sky. After a time she decided to come down. 
Below she found her foster home and dove down to land upon the roof. She 
crawled across the shingles until she found her window. Grateful to see 
it still opened she climbed in only to have her wings get caught on the 
window frame. She twisted and managed to get one of the smaller wing 
through the window and her right leg only to find herself even more 
stuck then before. 

&quot;Oh come on.&quot; She growled at the wings while pulling on the feathers, 
&quot;Please work with me.&quot; She pleaded, but the more she struggled the more 
she worried that someone might hear her, &quot;Why is it that I had to have 
six wings of all things?&quot; She wondered when she felt someone watching 
her. She spun her head around to find Ashley sitting upon the top bunk 
of her bed, &quot;How did you get in here?&quot; She asked the albino. 

The girl jumped down from her spot and crossed the room with her arms 
crossed behind her back. She examined the situation then pointed that 
Kai&#39;s wings and smiled. 

&quot;Your willing to help me?&quot; Kai asked a tad sceptical. For some reason 
she sensed she could understand what this girl was trying to say. 

Ashley nodded and her smile brightened. She walked around behind Kai and 
started to work at one wing after another. With some effort the two 
girls managed to free each wing. When the final wing came free Kai fell 
through the window to the ground. Ashley ran around the girl and looked 
under the wings until she found Kai. 

Kai looked up at the girl with a sheepish grin on her face, &quot;I must look 
so graceful right now.&quot; She commented. Ashley offered her hand, which 
Kai took, and helped her to her feet. Kai&#39;s wings were so large that 
they bent along the low slanting ceiling. She looked up at the wings 
then over at her tiny bed. &quot;This is just not going to work. There has to 
be something I can do about these things.&quot; 

Ashley tugged on Kai&#39;s shirt causing her to face the girl. She placed 
her hands together in front of her chest and closed her eyes, then 
opened them and smiled at Kai. 

Kai cocked her head in curiosity of what the girl was trying to say. She 
mimicked the girl&#39;s movements and closed her eyes. The image of the 
winged tattoo appeared before her eyes as it did when she looking into 
Ashley&#39;s eyes. But she didn&#39;t feel fear this time. There was something 
calming about it this time. The image slowly faded away and when Kai 
opened her eyes she saw Ashley smiling brightly at her. She pointed 
above Kai. Kai looked up to see the wings were glowing then faded away 
leaving only a few remaining feathers floating in the air. Each feather 
weakened and vanished before landing upon the floor, &quot;Wow... How did you 
know that?&quot; She asked the girl in astonishment. 

Ashley simply smiled and shrugged then skipped over to the bed and sat 
upon the bottom bunk and continues to smile at Kai. 

Kai only shook her head, &quot;You are one strange girl.&quot; She remarked then 
looked at her right hand and the tattoos cover it, &quot;Mind you I guess I&#39;m 
pretty strange too. What is with these tattoos?&quot; She looked at herself 
in the mirror, &quot;I look like I&#39;m a punk rocker or something. Wait!&quot; She 
spun around so the back of her torn shirt was facing the mirror and saw 
that now a tattoo of the she saw in her mind covered her entire back, 
&quot;Does that mean... That I&#39;m a Sister of Death?&quot; She puzzled and shook 
her head in shock then glanced over at Ashley, &quot;Would that trick work 
for these too?&quot; She inquired pointing at the tattoos. 

Ashley shrugged and her face grew long as if she was saddened by the 
prospect. 

Kai gave the girl an odd face, &quot;Do you like these?&quot; She remarked. 

Ashley quickly nodded and smiled again. 

Kai turned and looked at herself in the mirror again, &quot;I admit that some 
of them are cool looking but I can&#39;t go around like this. Mrs. Mathews 
would kill me.&quot; She closed her eyes and wished there was a way to make 
the tattoos disappear. When she opened them the tattoo began to seep 
backwards into her eyes. She was startled as the dark lines appeared to 
be moving under her eyelids only to discover that there was no pain. She 
peered down at her arm to see those tattoos were also moving back up her 
burnt sleeve. She let out a sigh of relief and smiled at her image in 
the mirror when she noticed something very odd about her teeth. She 
opened her mouth to see that her top canines and first premolars were 
pronounced, like some strange vampire. She ran her tongue along her 
fangs and looked closely at her eyes. While the right irus had returned 
to it&#39;s natural light blue the left remained a glowing yellow. She 
closed her eyes and opened them again to find that now the right eye was 
yellow and the left one blue. She blinked a few times to see the colours 
switch places with every time she closed her eyes. &quot;What gives here?!?&quot; 
She growled at her refection, &quot;This is driving me insane. Why do other 
magical girls gain a breast size and shorter shirts while all I get is 
fangs, different coloured eyes and wings that tear my clothes to 
shreds?&quot; She ranted in frustration.

There was a soft rapping at the door that interrupted Kai&#39;s rambles. 
Ashley got to her feet and opened the door to allow Cindy to enter the 
room, &quot;Mrs. Mathews want to speak with you.&quot; She said to Ashley, then 
turned to leave when she noticed Kai standing there, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you 
were home.&quot; She said shyly then noticed something was different about 
Kai. She entered the room more and approached the girl causing Kai to 
take a step backwards. Cindy looked deep into Kai&#39;s eyes and gave her a 
knowing smile, &quot;I thought so... you are one of us after all.&quot; She said 
with a grin, &quot;Mrs. Mathews is angry so you should leave before she finds 
you are home.&quot; She nodded towards the window and turned around to leave 
the room. 

&quot;Thanks Cindy.&quot; Kai said as she watched Ashley and Cindy leave together. 
Quickly she stripped off the ruined shirt and pulled on a new one before 
climbing back out the window. She had done this many times before and 
found it rather easy. She slid down the shingles until she came to the 
edge of the roof and leapt off. It wasn&#39;t very high and Kai never once 
hurt herself. Now with her new power she was even less afraid. She just 
hoped that her wings didn&#39;t suddenly decide to spring out again and tear 
yet another shirt. She landed softly and let out a sigh of relief when 
her wings didn&#39;t appear. She run to the front door and opened it. 

&quot;So you finally return.&quot; Mrs. Mathews stated angrily, &quot;Where in lords 
name have you been? The school declared you missing around lunch hour. 
You&#39;d better have a good explanation.&quot; 

&quot;I went for a walk.&quot; Kai explained while entering the house, &quot;I told you 
I didn&#39;t belong there.&quot; Although now she was beginning to wonder if 
someone at the school knew more about her then she did. 

&quot;You are so impossible at times.&quot; Mrs. Mathews remarked and turned away 
from the girl, &quot;Well you are just on time then. It would seem since I 
took in one child of the Western Woods it was decided that I&#39;d be able 
to handle two of you. I&#39;d like you to meet your new roommate, Ashley.&quot; 

Kai stumbled into the room, &quot;Ashley?!?&quot; It suddenly made sense to her 
way the girl was in her room. Anita did say that the girl was from the 
woods and still, &quot;I thought she had a home? I mean I saw her at school 
today and everything.&quot;

&quot;Her old family found her too strange so she lives here now.&quot; Mrs. 
Mathews let out a sigh of frustration, &quot;My house is filling with nothing 
but degenerates that no one wants.&quot; She stated as she left the room. 
								
Ashley bowed her head in shame and Cindy patted the girl on the 
shoulder. The two smiled at each other as if some strange silent bond 
had formed between them. 

&quot;Well I&#39;m glad to see you have found a friend, Cindy.&quot; Kai commented 
kicking off her shoes, &quot;You two are good for each other.&quot; She nodded in 
approval when there was a knocking at the door, &quot;I&#39;ve got it.&quot; She 
opened the door to find Anita standing on the porch with Kai&#39;s backpack 
in hand. 

&quot;Kai!!!&quot; Anita exclaimed, tears brimming in her eyes. She threw her arms 
around Kai and hugged her tightly, &quot;I thought you were dead.&quot; She 
mumbled into the girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Where were you? They found your bag 
pack on the roof and  I was so worried.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m alright.&quot; Kai replied, &quot;Everything is just fi-&quot; Kai felt something 
deep inside of her shift, her right arm twitched and her fangs ache. She 
let go of Anita and stared into the girl&#39;s tear filled eyes. Her mouth 
quivered and she licked at her lips. She quickly lowered her eyes from 
the girl&#39;s.

&quot;Kai?&quot; Anita became concerned for her friend, &quot;What happened to your 
ey-&quot; 

Mrs. Mathews poked her head out of the kitchen, &quot;Why Anita so good to 
see you. Come in, Come in.&quot; She looked down at Kai who was slightly 
trembling, &quot;Why don&#39;t you invite your friend in? Sometimes I wonder 
about you child. Why can you be more like Anita here? She is smart and 
intelligent. You should try to follow after her example.&quot;

Anita blushed lightly, &quot;I&#39;m not all that.&quot; She faked modesty. 

Kai grabbed Anita by the arm and turned her head away from everyone, &quot;We 
are going to do some homework, alright?&quot; She pulled Anita into the house 
and closed the door after her. 

&quot;Kai?&quot; Anita inquired confused by her friends actions. Kai was never 
interested in studying before unless it was something personal. She then 
noticed Ashley standing near the stairs with Cindy, &quot;Ashley?!? What are 
you doing here?&quot; A pang of jealousy wove its way through the girl&#39;s 
heart. 

&quot;She is staying with us now.&quot; Mrs. Mathews replied, &quot;If you like you can 
stay for dinner too. I&#39;ll make enough for everyone.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Anita called out behind her as Kai dragged the girl across the 
living room and up the stairs with Cindy and Ashley right behind them. 
Kai pulled Anita into her room and sat the girl upon her bed then rushed 
to the other side of the room. Ashley closed the door after Cindy 
entered and sat beside Anita, smiling up at her. 

Anita return the girl&#39;s smile with a nervous one, &quot;Kai, what is going on 
here?&quot; She probed, worried about her friend. 

Kai clenched at her chest and held onto the window sill. Her arm felt as 
if it was on fire and her teeth ached something furious, &quot;No... not 
now... I promised her...&quot; She pleaded with her body. Trying to command 
it to not take her over again. 

Anita got to her feet, &quot;Kai?&quot; She stepped forwards to have Ashley reach 
out and touch her hand. She looked down at the pale girl to see Ashley 
had fear in her eyes and was shaking her head violently. She turned back 
to Kai, &quot;Why won&#39;t you let me help you?&quot; She asked ignoring Ashley&#39;s 
protests and approaching the girl. 

Kai looked at her reflection in the glass of the window to see the 
tattoos were yet again spreading across her face. She slammed her eyes 
shut, &quot;Stay away from me!!&quot; Kai screamed. There was fear and frustration 
in her words. 

Anita staggered backwards for a moment, &quot;Kai, what is the matter with 
you?&quot; She moved closer, &quot;Why won&#39;t you look at me?&quot; She suddenly grabbed 
Kai by the arms and spun her around to look into Kai&#39;s fear filled eyes, 
&quot;Kai, your eye?&quot; She was startled by what she saw. 

Kai looked away from Anita to see herself in the mirror again. The 
tattoos had yet again retreated and Kai let out a sigh of relief, &quot;Oh, 
it is just that eye again.&quot; She muttered. 

&quot;What happened to her your eye?&quot; Anita asked frantically. She let go of 
her friend&#39;s arm and put her hand to her mouth, &quot;Did... did a Sister 
touch you?&quot; She asked in terror. 

&quot;You could put it that way.&quot; Kai said with a exhausted sigh. 

&quot;She is one of them. One of us.&quot; Cindy suddenly piped up with a broad 
smile on her face, &quot;I knew she had to be. I could feel it.&quot; She placed a 
hand upon her chest, closed her eyes and took a deep breath. 

&quot;What the hell are you going on about?&quot; Anita probed the girls, &quot;What 
are these two doing here anyway? Did you tell them about what happened 
and not me?&quot;

&quot;Ashley is now under the care of Mrs. Mathews and shared my room.&quot; Kai 
explained with a deep breath, &quot;Cindy... well...&quot; She looked at the girl 
and shrugged, &quot;I have no idea what is with her.&quot; 

Anita shook her head in frustration, &quot;Why do you keep dodging my 
questions?&quot; She grabbed Kai by the shoulders, &quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; 
She demanded. 

Kai&#39;s body overflowed with the same sensation as before only more 
intense then before, &quot;I- Said- Stay- Away!!!&quot; She snarled as she doubled 
over and toppled to the ground. 

&quot;Kai!!!&quot; Anita dropped to her friend&#39;s side and tried to hold her only 
to have Kai push her away. 

Kai suddenly lifted her head to glare at Anita. Streams of black tears 
run down her face and her fangs where beared, &quot;Don&#39;t you understand?!&quot; 
She sobbed, &quot;I am the death you fear so dearly.&quot; She grabbed the back of 
her shirt and pulled it up just as her wings burst forth and once again 
filled the room. Anita scrambled backwards until her back hit the 
dresser, &quot;I don&#39;t want to take you.&quot; Kris cried as she curled up in a 
ball, &quot;But this body...&quot; She let out a deep sob and curled into a ball. 
Suddenly there was a light tapping at the window. The Kai looked up to 
see Poe sitting on the sill tapping on the window frame, &quot;Poe...&quot; She 
wiped at her eyes as she curiously watched as the bird jumped off the 
sill. It hopped over to Kai and looked her in the eyes. 

&quot;What is a crow doing here?&quot; Anita asked frightened by the black bird. 

Kai got to her knees and picked up the bird, &quot;He is not a crow. He is a 
raven.&quot; She stated petting the bird. Ashley and Cindy crossed the room 
and carefully knelt to pet the raven. The bird rubbed it&#39;s head against 
Cindy&#39;s hand causing the girl to giggle in glee. 

Anita closed her eyes against the image before her, &quot;This can&#39;t be 
happening.&quot; She stated shaking her head in dismay, &quot;How can you be one 
of the Sisters of Death? You were hit by a car and knocked out cold. 
Nothing is supposed to be able to do that to a Death Angel.&quot; 

Kai looked up at her wings, &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened but I want to 
know.&quot; 

Suddenly Poe fluttered his wings and broke free from Kai&#39;s hands. He 
flew to the window sill and turned to the girls, &quot;Follow me. Follow me.&quot; 
It cawed. Then flew out the window. 

Kai jumped to her feet and ran to the window to see the raven glide down 
to the street where he landed upon the shoulder of the same girl that 
Kai saw on the roof, &quot;Who?&quot; She asked aloud and squinted down the road 
at the girl, &quot;Brenna?&quot; 

&quot;Brenna?!?&quot; Anita got to her feet and tried to find her way around Kai&#39;s 
wings, &quot;The guardian of the Western Woods? She who will guide those to 
salvation or death?&quot; She finally found the window and looked out to see 
the girl with the raven turn and started to walk down the road, &quot;Is that 
really her? Where is she headed?&quot;

Kai looked down the road, &quot;The Western Woods...&quot; She muttered. She 
turned around to run after the girl only to find her wings caught on the 
ceiling again. Sighing in frustration she closed her eyes and 
concentration. The wings and tattoos again faded away. 

&quot;That is amazing.&quot; Anita remarked in astonishment as her eyes followed 
one of the glowing feathers as it drifted to the dresser and vanished. 
She looked up in time to see a portion of the tattoos on Kai&#39;s back 
before the girl fixed her shirt. 

&quot;Come on.&quot; Kai demanded, &quot;We have to catch up to her.&quot; The group of 
girls ran out of the room and down the stair to find their shoes. 

&quot;Where are you all off too?&quot; Mrs. Mathews asked curiously, &quot;Dinner will 
be done in a few hours.&quot;

&quot;We are just going to the park.&quot; Kai lied as she hastily pulled on her 
shoes, &quot;We&#39;ll be back in a few.&quot; She flung open the door and stepped out 
onto the patio to see Brenna fading in the distance, &quot;Come on.&quot; She 
urged. 

Anita stumbled out the door while still pulling on her second shoe, &quot;Is 
she still there?&quot; She inquired looked around. 

&quot;I saw her disappear down the road.&quot; Kai replied as she ran out onto the 
lawn. 

&quot;Wait for us!&quot; Cindy called out as she held Ashley&#39;s hand tightly and 
the two of them came fumbling out of the house. 

&quot;Make sure you are all back in time for Dinner!&quot; Mrs. Mathews called out 
after the girls as they ran down the street towards their new destiny.
