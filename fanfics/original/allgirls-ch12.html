&quot;Good day, class.&quot;

Only a few girls greeted Janna Raulson as she came into the classroom, 
and those had been the ones who went through Miss Madsen&#39;s hour. The 
rest just nodded or waved, or at worst, made no acknowledgment 
whatsoever. Janna was unaffected by the tepid response; she came to 
teach history, not manners. She sat at her desk and began taking silent 
roll.

Victoria Grissom, Zane Klein, Vai Knox, Usha Krishnan, Ana Lu, Corona 
Marcos, Jocelyn McKeough, Nomi Nakatori, May and June Tramble, Mira van 
Dijk, Amina Washim, Ancelin Yi, and Rai Zanders&#151;check!

&quot;With introductions over,&quot; she began, &quot;it is time we begin our studies. 
History is relevant no matter what field you choose to go into. Looking 
into the precedents of yesteryear help us better understand how today&#39;s 
standards were formed. Knowing who and what came ahead of us gives us 
the knowledge to further learn, and we begin to value and understand the 
sacrifices and mistakes people have made. Besides, sometimes it can even 
be fun.

&quot;I&#39;m not a student of religion and I&#39;ve devoted myself to no particular 
faith, and I agree with the right of freedom in regards to this matter, 
so do not think we will study anything involving any spiritual belief; I 
am simply here to look at facts. I have given each of you a textbook 
yesterday; would you please turn it to the third page? If you do not 
have one, I must deduct points from your grade.&quot; Everyone did, and 
discovered that they were led into the very early civilizations of 
Oriental culture.

Raulson asked a random student to read aloud the first three paragraphs, 
then went into a very basic discussion of the old culture, emphasizing 
the struggle of the then-king to unite all of China; then explained how 
he went about building the Great Wall of China, which still stood to 
that day. A few movie-loving students immediately knew what she was 
talking about, and commented as such.

&quot;They told this story in Hero, Miss Raulson,&quot; said Ana. Janna wasn&#39;t 
quite the buff on films, so she asked the blonde to explain. &quot;Well, um, 
I dunno if it&#39;s out on DVD yet, but Hero is this movie about this guy 
who has no name, and he tries to kill the king of old China, but first 
he has to get rid of these assassins&#151;&quot;

&quot;Ana,&quot; stated Rai sharply, interrupting her. Ana Lu squeaked and 
realized she had been babbling.

&quot;Uh, whoops. Anyway, it&#39;s sorta like what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Raulson probably didn&#39;t see, but it was best to make a neutral 
answer like that. &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad a few of you know the material. Now, 
may I resume, Ana?&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh, sorry there.&quot; Raulson accepted her apologetic smile and 
resumed. Ana began to wonder if she could bring Hero in for the class to 
watch, but seeing how indifferent her teacher acted towards it, it 
wasn&#39;t likely to happen.

Raulson resumed her discussion, taking breaks once in awhile as she 
asked her students to read and share their thoughts. She freely admitted 
that although that section of the textbook involved history from ages 
ago in another part of the world, it was still relevant and needed 
examination. American history (or even the histories of the countries 
many of the girls there originated from) would probably not be studied 
until after the holiday break, so everyone would have to sit and bear 
it.

Once the chapter had been dissected and digested, Janna made two 
promises to her class before issuing their homework. First, she 
guaranteed a kind of follow-up test for each chapter, but there would 
also be plenty of time to study and plenty of smaller pieces of work to 
go through beforehand. Second, she promised that the whole class would 
go through at least one activity involving the material discussed&#151;not a 
test, but something that involved everyone and their creativity.

&quot;If we are efficient,&quot; she said, &quot;we can get through one chapter per 
week. The first day of each week, I will introduce the new material and 
we will have readings and discussions, as we&#39;ve had today. The following 
day we shall get into the material more deeply, and have our first paper 
on it. The third day will be a study day; the fourth, activities, and by 
the fifth day, you should be prepared for a test. In the event that our 
weeks are shortened, I will try and squeeze some of the activities 
together. Any questions?&quot;

&quot;What sort of activities do you mean for us to have?&quot; asked Usha.

&quot;Good question. As a matter of fact, I think it would be best if I told 
you the first day of the week so you have time to prepare. Each week, 
your activity should reflect the chapter being studied. This week, I 
would like for everyone to be split up into groups and create something 
relevant to old Oriental culture. It could be a piece of art, a written 
work, a musical score, even a drama. Just as long as it&#39;s relevant and a 
group effort...&quot;

At this, most of the girls brightened with enthusiasm. Those in Elspeth 
Post&#39;s drama class were already elated at the notion of making their own 
production, but having even more freedom over their studies was nothing 
short of exciting. Raulson wisely brought them back down to earth, 
though, with an added note.

&quot;Now this doesn&#39;t mean you can do anything,&quot; she said. &quot;This week I&#39;ll 
let you off easy, but from now on, I&#39;ll have a list of activities for 
you to choose from. Groups can choose any activity they want, although I 
may give extra credit if you pick something nobody else has done. Any 
other questions?&quot;

&quot;Uh, what&#39;re we going to do on study days?&quot; asked Nomi. Raulson smiled.

&quot;Let&#39;s put it this way: you all have seen &#145;Jeopardy&#39;, right? It&#39;ll be 
just like that. You&#39;ll be divided into three teams, and each answer, or 
question, or whatever, will count for some points. You keep all the 
points you accumulate, so naturally, you&#39;ll want more points.&quot;

&quot;So nobody loses any points?&quot;

&quot;Only if you get it wrong. Any more?&quot; Nobody else had anything to ask, 
so Raulson wrapped up her class and sent everyone home without any 
work&#151;for the time. As each girl walked off to her next class, most 
banded together to talk or slip inside a restroom. Ana immediately clung 
to Rai, who looked like she didn&#39;t want company.

&quot;Sounds pretty cool, huh? So whaddya wanna do?&quot;

&quot;One at a time.&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh, okay. So does it sound cool or what?&quot; Ana&#39;s bubbly smile was 
more infectious than a plague; even Zanders couldn&#39;t contain her frosty 
stoicism, and smiled.

&quot;I guess. Creativity&#39;s always been my forte. I don&#39;t like having too 
much freedom, though.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Well, I need guidelines so I know where I can and can&#39;t go. Too much 
freedom can be overwhelming; too much of anything&#39;s not good.&quot;

&quot;What about too much love?&quot; she whispered hopefully, eyes aflutter. 
Zanders turned pink and sighed. Ana quickly gave her a kiss on the cheek 
and giggled softly in her ear.

&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; whispered Rai softly.

&quot;Don&#39;t what?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tease me.&quot;

&quot;You like that?&quot; Rai couldn&#39;t answer, at least not confidently. She 
could barely even talk. Ana was her polar opposite and someone who she 
believed she&#39;d distance herself from as often as possible, yet the perky 
girl was like a barnacle&#151;a very happy, entertaining, cute barnacle. She 
gave Rai the shivers and made her question herself a lot&#151;more than she 
ever had wanted to question herself.

&quot;Stop,&quot; she managed, pushing the smaller girl away. Ana just giggled and 
attached herself to her so-called girlfriend again.

&quot;Aw, you like it! So what&#39;re we gonna do, huh? You got some plans for 
this activity of hers?&quot;

&quot;Not really. I was just thinking of writing something, like a song or 
something.&quot;

&quot;Oh, cool. I want in.&quot; Rai shrugged. Why not? She&#39;d just bug her anyway, 
and Ana could give good inspiration at times.

&quot;Okay. ...Don&#39;t hold me so tight; I&#39;ll lose my balance.&quot; Ana just 
laughed mischievously, and loosened up just enough so she wouldn&#39;t look 
like an octopus.

&quot;So, wanna go in the ladies&#39; room and make out?&quot; she whispered. A stab 
of eroticism plunged into Rai&#39;s chest, giving her a shock. Had Ana 
really said that? Was she serious? ...Was she ever serious? Rai had to 
wonder&#151;and hadn&#39;t she been attracted to men only when they first met?

&quot;You&#39;re crazy,&quot; she managed, shoving the smaller girl away. Ana, as 
serious as a clown, giggled and tagged Zanders on the shoulder.

&quot;Aw, come on! You mean you don&#39;t want to?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s gross,&quot; she grumbled.

&quot;What, kissing or doing it in the bathroom?&quot; Rai wanted to say &quot;both&quot;, 
but she knew Ana would be crushed, so she just snorted. &quot;You know I was 
just kidding,&quot; said the blonde in remedy. &quot;But seriously, we can go 
smooch somewhere else if&#151;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather not,&quot; stated Zanders stuffily. Ana chuckled and walked 
around her self-proclaimed girlfriend (they certainly weren&#39;t an 
official pair, not really, not even after a year of being &quot;friends&quot;) 
like an overactive dog.

&quot;Oh, look at the grumpy woman in the morning,&quot; she crooned. &quot;Maybe a 
little hug will cheer her up.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;ve&#151;&quot;

&quot;GLOMP!!!&quot;

&quot;Oof! ...Hugged me enough.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense,&quot; squeaked Lu happily, embracing Rai tightly. &quot;You can never 
get enough hugs! Hug, hug, hug!&quot; Rai&#39;s face turned red and blue from 
anger and suffocation, but since she didn&#39;t want to hurt Ana more than 
necessary, she just pried her off and shoved her away.

&quot;Leave me alone. I need to get to class.&quot;

&quot;So you wanna eat together at lunch? Or come over to my house?&quot; Zanders 
just huffed away, leaving poor Ana in her dust. Not one to take such 
rejection so seriously, Ana just cast it aside, called out a farewell, 
and ducked inside her next class&#151;ironically, two minutes early.

............

Some of the girls in Janna Raulson&#39;s history class also shared Janet 
Keys&#39; art class. Keys was older and more, perhaps, conservative than the 
more strict Raulson, probably because the class she taught leaned more 
to the creative side rather than the academic. Many of the students 
thought they were both very pretty, but Janet was more well-liked 
because of how she related to her students. In spite of being one of the 
older teachers there, though she didn&#39;t look it, she understood the 
younger generation well and often acted as their confidante and friend, 
even during class hours.

Keys had no particular great ambition or plan for her class to follow, 
at least not during that year. She had been very good about taking one 
great trip abroad every few years, perhaps to the Smithsonian or even 
the Louvre, but nothing like that would happen that year&#151;maybe the next. 
In fact, she had no big projects planned at all, only a series of 
smaller ones meant to chip at the women&#39;s rough edges and make them 
understand, if not appreciate, the world of arts.

(And for the record, she had only hosted one nude modeling class her 
whole career, and was asked quite nicely not to occur again, without any 
hard feelings being expressed. So for those girls who had their hopes, 
they would be disappointed, although Janet encouraged drawings and 
sketches of all other kinds)

On one of those seemingly-minor days, Janet Keys gathered all her 
students around on one big table and told them what she had planned for 
the future. Most everyone was still new to the concept of coloring and 
construction, so she would devote much of her time going over the basics 
so that everyone would understand and have, at least, an elementary 
grasp of things. By the end of that week, she hoped that everyone would 
at least be able to paint something more complex than a blotch or stick 
figure.

She went as far as explaining her schedule for the whole month, but 
didn&#39;t like to plan any further since, as she liked to profess, the 
future was uncertain and anything could happen. After going over the 
basics, the girls would go into their first major project: they were 
asked to think of a nice song or musical composition that would fit well 
with art, and bring it in. The class&#39;s songs would be burned on one 
disk, and as a group, the students would paint a picture depicting what 
they &quot;felt&quot; in their song.

&quot;To put it simply,&quot; Keys told them, &quot;it&#39;ll be just like Fantasia, the 
Disney movie, except this will be only one scene&#151;unless you truly feel 
the need to make many.&quot; And of course, to assist those in need, Keys 
permitted the girls to watch Fantasia so they could get a good idea of 
what was to come. Coincidentally, the music teacher (Sarah Johansson) 
would also use the Disney film in her class, opting to teach upon the 
other side of the marriage between visual and audio art.

Their very first day, the girls were asked to construct personalized 
nametags for their work stations so Keys could identify them and take 
silent roll. These tags, mere construction paper folded in half to make 
a crude triangle, could have any decoration as long as it had their name 
(or a nickname) and nothing offensive. As her class came in, they picked 
out their nametags from a pile and placed them wherever they sat, which 
was completely up to them since Keys didn&#39;t have arranged seating. 
Besides, the girls worked best wherever they were most comfortable; her 
class was fortunate to have many windows in it.

Alexandra Blair (she had written &quot;Furious Hail&quot; on her tag), Olivia 
Johnson, Farrah Kwong, Hero Love, Ana Lu, Corona Marcos, Lilian 
Nachtheim, Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon, May Tramble, Amina Washim, Ancelin Yi, 
Rai Zanders: they all had made one according to their own taste, 
although some were definitely more &quot;interesting&quot; to look at than others. 
Once they were seated and quiet, Keys spoke up&#151;she also worked at the 
same large table the girls did. She had specially ordered several 
rectangular tables and had them arranged in a large square that took up 
half of the large room, so everyone could sit and work and have a good 
view of the room while still having space.

&quot;How is everyone today?&quot; she asked, and she meant it. Her class answered 
in lukewarm fashion, though if anyone wanted to, they could speak up and 
spill their guts. &quot;Well, it seems enthusiasm&#39;s here enough. I would like 
for everyone, today, to not go for any supplies or any paper: no 
pencils, pens, brushes, or anything. Just sit. Today I would like for 
everyone to participate and work together to try and demonstrate art 
without supplies. Can people express themselves without a paper and a 
brush?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; answered Corona, &quot;in music.&quot;

&quot;Ah, but doesn&#39;t music have its supplies as well?&quot; Corona nodded in 
silent reluctance.

&quot;In... drama?&quot; guessed Hero.

&quot;Are you asking me or telling me?&quot; Nearly everyone rolled their eyes. 
Only the newcomers weren&#39;t aware of Keys&#39; favorite counter-remark; 
everyone knew her because of it, and tried hard to avoid it. Hero tried 
rephrasing her question.

&quot;Uh, I am asking you if it&#39;s possible to find art in drama.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but even then you need supplies.&quot;

&quot;Not all the time. And singing... you don&#39;t need anything to sing.&quot;

&quot;Good, good. Anyone else?&quot;

&quot;Love,&quot; spoke Ana quietly. Keys looked impressed.

&quot;Ah, but is love an expression of one&#39;s self&#151;is it art? Can love be 
art?&quot; She spoke rhetorically, letting her pupils decide the answers for 
themselves, whether mentally or out loud.

&quot;Sometimes.&quot;

&quot;In what way?&quot; She encouraged Ana&#39;s thought with a smile. These girls 
were obviously onto something good and needed stimulants to keep it 
going, but even something silly had the potential to grow. Discouraging 
something was not Janet&#39;s forte; she wanted her students to think of all 
possibilities, even if they didn&#39;t seem right.

&quot;Well... love can cause people to create things in new ways&#151;like they 
can make stuff and write songs or love letters, and I guess in that 
sense it&#39;s art. Oh, wait&#151;that involves supplies, doesn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but you&#39;re going somewhere with that idea. Would anyone like to 
continue, or share something new? Where can you see art without 
supplies?&quot;

&quot;Through actions,&quot; said Farrah. &quot;Like for example: if art&#39;s nothing more 
than self-expression, can&#39;t people express themselves through actions? 
Like if I was angry, I&#39;d paint a violent picture or create a piece of 
broken pottery, but I could also show my anger through my actions. Would 
that count?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a very interesting point,&quot; admitted Keys. &quot;I think you and Ana are 
onto something. Yes?&quot; She pointed to a raised hand, although it was not 
a prerequisite in Keys&#39; class to raise a hand for attention.

&quot;Um... would speech count as art?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Amina took a nervous breath.

&quot;The spoken word. I guess this goes along with what was said about 
drama, only you don&#39;t need anything to talk except a voice. If you say 
something, like a speech or a poem, or a song, would that count?&quot; Janet 
Keys smiled and tapped her fingers against her cheek.

&quot;That&#39;s a very interesting perspective. Would anyone else like to try?&quot;

&quot;Sex?&quot; guessed Olivia. Most of the girls laughed, even Olivia, who 
hadn&#39;t meant that seriously. Keys smiled, but in thought.

&quot;Well... that could be true...&quot;

&quot;You might need supplies for it!&quot; cackled Farrah, and the girls hooted 
even louder. Keys&#39; laugh was restrained, and she called order to her 
students after awhile.

&quot;All right, all right, settle down. Olivia has a very good point; sexual 
activities could be considered a form of art, if done right.&quot;

&quot;Well since you&#39;re on that tangent, may I say something?&quot;

&quot;Certainly, Miss Yi.&quot;

&quot;Just Ancelin.&quot; Farrah couldn&#39;t help but smile a bit as Ancelin spoke 
up. She had heard enough about the tall brunette (from Ivory) to fill a 
library. She didn&#39;t condone what her friend did or where her preferences 
were, and she had made plain her beliefs more than once, but Ancelin 
seemed like a sweet girl, although probably not the kind to go for 
anyone as wild as Ivory.

&quot;You said that if done right, sex could be an art,&quot; she stated, and Keys 
nodded. &quot;Then would it be true that anything good would be considered 
art? Everything that&#39;s been said here, whether it was love or action or 
sex, has some good to it, and it occurred to me that these things 
probably wouldn&#39;t be art if there was something bad to it.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s a good point, but many wicked things have been seen as 
art.&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t believe that,&quot; replied Ancelin gravely. &quot;The truly bad 
things in life cannot be seen as art; it must be what good is concealed 
within the bad that... uh... art comes from.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Ancelin floundered for an answer for a few seconds before coming 
up with one. &quot;Take... the human body. There&#39;s such thing as modesty, but 
there&#39;s also such thing as beauty. Uh... or death. It&#39;s sad and tragic, 
but it&#39;s also truth, and much good may come of it, even if a good person 
dies.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot;

&quot;I guess what I&#39;m saying is that the... uh... existence of something can 
be art. You don&#39;t have to make it for it to be there. I mean, when I was 
a kid, I used to think of all sorts of things when I looked up at the 
sky. You know, cloud art. But if that&#39;s art, all it really takes is 
imagination.&quot;

&quot;Very good,&quot; said Keys, and she left the compliment at that. &quot;Well, you 
are all correct in a sense: art does not need supplies to be art. It can 
be expressed through feelings, or love, or sex, or goodness, or even 
imagination&#151;just as long as you include originality and personality. And 
personality goes a long way.&quot;

............

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told you.&quot;

&quot;Try me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a real doozy of a love triangle.&quot; Corona&#39;s mouth twitched into a 
smile. Farrah continued with, &quot;Well, if you really must know, she has a 
thing for my best friend, Ivory. Ivory&#39;s more gay than fifteen Ellens 
and Ethridges, but we go back a long way so she doesn&#39;t think of me as 
more than a buddy. Thank God, too. Anyway, I know she&#39;s got her eye on 
Ive, but that poor girl&#39;s just wasting her time. Ivory only uses her for 
sex as far as I know; her true objective is Ancelin, that brunette girl 
that talked about art and imagination earlier.&quot;

&quot;So your friend likes Ancelin, not Alexandra?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Farrah trailed off and began to go flush. &quot;Likes is an 
understatement. More like obsesses.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s not interested in Alexandra?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; sighed Kwong sadly, &quot;she&#39;s not. And that girl&#39;s gonna go nuts when 
she finds out. Why do you wanna know?&quot; Corona gave a little shrug.

&quot;No reason.&quot;</pre>
