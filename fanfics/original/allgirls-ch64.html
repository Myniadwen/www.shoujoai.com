<h1>All Girls School (part 64 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch63.html">Back to Part 63</a><pre>She could still hear it as she drove away. Why can&#39;t you be like normal 
girls? Why do you have to make things harder on yourself, and on me? 
Don&#39;t you think about the consequences? You know what happened to all 
those other people. Do you want to end up like that? I&#39;m ashamed to call 
you my daughter! If you want to live at your friend&#39;s house, you go 
right ahead, because you won&#39;t be welcome here. Well why don&#39;t you 
leave? Go on, get out! And don&#39;t come back until you&#39;ve got some sense 
in your head.

&quot;Some sense, right,&quot; Ayanna whispered to herself. She sighed as she 
turned left, into the familiar neighborhood. It was snowing. &quot;Merry 
Christmas to you too, mom.&quot;

&quot;Eve of Christ&#39;s Mass&quot;

She knew the neighborhood by heart, having driven through it several 
times to and from Hero&#39;s house. Knowing she would be welcome, and 
fearing it was the only refuge for her at that time, she drove through 
and spotted the two-story house easily. Ayanna parked in the driveway 
and went up to the door: Hero, her hero, what a woman. Would she be 
there? It was December 24th, so perhaps she was at church. Ayanna wished 
she had called her. Hero never took her phone to church. She knocked 
rapidly three times.

&quot;Well Merry Christmas!&quot; Mr. Love greeted her before long, a smile on his 
face and a hug in his arms. Ayanna felt a little awkward hugging her 
girlfriend&#39;s father, but hey, it was Christmas. &quot;Come on in! We weren&#39;t 
expecting you, though.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; She came through the door, took off her boots, and let Mr. Love 
take her coat. &quot;I know I should&#39;ve called. It&#39;s a bit short-notice.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense, you&#39;re always welcome. Dear!&quot; he called to his wife, and 
then, &quot;Hero! Ayanna&#39;s here! Come say hello!&quot; Mrs. Love poked her head 
into the anteroom, her hair looking splendid and her smile beaming.

&quot;Hello, dear!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I thought you&#39;d be coming on by sometime, 
but I wish you had called. Well, no matter; I&#39;ve got some lunch if 
you&#39;re hungry.&quot;

&quot;Oh, um...&quot;

&quot;Please, have a seat at the table,&quot; she encouraged. &quot;I&#39;ll just be in the 
kitchen a bit longer. Hero! Your girlfriend&#39;s here! Where is that 
child...&quot; Ayanna smiled awkwardly as the two parents of her girlfriend 
busies themselves, neither of them bothered very much by her presence. 
So, she was right: she was welcome there. Ayanna sighed and hugged 
herself. Her mother had been so insensitive to her...

&quot;Hey, wassup?&quot; She felt a firm slap on her shoulder and turned to greet 
Hero, who had on a festive green sweater. They exchanged a kiss, which 
always did brighten Ayanna&#39;s mood.

&quot;Oh, um...I just...thought I&#39;d come over.&quot;

&quot;Really? Cool! Listen, make yourself at home. Watch some TV or have 
something to eat. I&#39;m a little busy but I&#39;ll be with you in a jiff.&quot; She 
winked and flitted off, just like a fairy, leaving Ayanna to do as she 
pleased. She dove into the kitchen, absorbed by Yuletide smells, sights, 
and sounds: cinnamon sticks, burning wicks, red and green, a bubbling 
tureen, and drifting, lifting songs quietly filtering out of several 
radios scattered around the house. It was like observing the festival of 
Fezziwig&#39;s, and here Ayanna, a shy, young Scrooge!

She grabbed a small handful of M&amp;Ms and a few slices of rye bread, and 
made her way to the Love living room, which was bright since a large 
window brought in lots of white wintry sunshine. Here she sat down and 
let the music of the season calm her, here she ate and tried to forget 
her domestic woes. She had spoken to her mother about Hero, about how 
much they were in love and how wonderful they felt together, and she had 
just been chewed out terribly. Mrs. Montgomery wasn&#39;t quite as 
open-minded to homosexuality as the Loves were, and had all but exiled 
her poor daughter, right on Christmas Eve! So of course, despite the 
warmth of the household, she was depressed.

Holiday blues, indeed.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Hero interrupted her thought process and plopped down on the 
couch next to her, a few pieces of food in her own plate. They kissed 
again before the chatter started. &quot;So what brings you here, hon? Not 
that I don&#39;t love the visit, I do, it&#39;s just...well, don&#39;t you have your 
own family to hang out with?&quot;

&quot;Mom&#39;s not...big on family,&quot; she mentioned.

&quot;...Oh. Gosh, sucks to be you. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without mine. 
I&#39;d be lost.&quot;

&quot;They do seem wonderful.&quot;

&quot;A lot of work&#39;s been put into it. Hey, come on, lemme see your smile. 
You&#39;re starting to look like Olivia now!&quot; She grinned and jabbed her 
girlfriend playfully, which caused Ayanna to at least crack a smile.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t diss my cuz&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Sorry. You look like you&#39;ve got a lot on your mind. C&#39;mon, talk to me. 
It&#39;ll make you feel better.&quot; Ayanna took a breath. She found that 
talking to Hero, or even Hero&#39;s parents, was more therapeutic than 
speaking with her mother or her cousin, or even some of her other 
friends. Hero just had a naturally trustworthy disposition, like she 
could accept anything and be kept to secrecy about it, too. Despite her 
collection of flaws and freakishness, she was really quite a gem, and 
constantly lived up to her namesake.

&quot;I told my mom about us. She&#39;s never much liked homosexuals, and ever 
since I came out two years ago, we&#39;ve been walking on eggshells. We 
hardly speak anyway. I finally told her about you and me, and she just 
freaked. She practically kicked me out and told me not to come back 
until, quote, &#145;I&#39;ve got some sense in my head&#39;.&quot;

&quot;My God,&quot; Hero murmured. She drew Ayanna in for a hug and kissed her 
again. &quot;So that&#39;s why you dropped by so suddenly. Hey, but maybe it was 
a good call. I mean, maybe it&#39;s for the best. Spending some time away 
might let you both cool off.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the one who lost it!&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay...&quot; Hero caressed Ayanna&#39;s dark hair and kissed her cheek. 
Her mother came in, smiling and bearing a plate full of things that 
smelled...oh, heavenly!

&quot;You two are so adorable!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;It&#39;s almost enough to make me 
wish I had had a girlfriend when I was your age.&quot;

&quot;MOM!!&quot;

&quot;Watch where you say those things, dear,&quot; said her husband playfully as 
he passed behind her. He pinched her behind &quot;just to make sure&quot;, and 
kissed her ear.

&quot;Oh my. And you weren&#39;t any less curious when you were sixteen?&quot;

&quot;Oh, didn&#39;t you know? I was attracted to girls just like they were. So 
Hero just might take after her daddy.&quot;

&quot;Dad, come on!&quot; she blurted. &quot;I&#39;m not gay, I&#39;m bi!&quot;

&quot;Oh, so it&#39;s mommy you resemble.&quot;

&quot;You guys...&quot; She chuckled and rolled her eyes; the two older ones 
smiled and kissed each other.

&quot;So?&quot; said Mrs. Love, &quot;Isn&#39;t anyone going to take one of my cinnamon 
cookies? Your bi-curious father and I worked so hard on them.&quot; Her 
husband swiped one of the cookies and took a deep bite.

&quot;Dear, you&#39;re more gay than the lot of us combined.&quot;

&quot;Say that again later tonight!&quot;

&quot;Oh, but...so many pieces of mistletoe...and Santa must get at least one 
kiss from the fine Madame.&quot; The two laughed and teased each other, their 
daughter watching fondly. So, even after all this time, they still loved 
each other like they were newlyweds...

&quot;Your family&#39;s the coolest,&quot; whispered Ayanna once they were alone 
again. &quot;I really envy you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...I do wish more people grew up like me. God...sometimes I don&#39;t 
feel worthy.&quot;

&quot;You?&quot; Hero nodded and smiled.

&quot;The whole punk-girl thing, and on top of that, being bisexual. And 
still. They freaking adore me. Even my siblings! Ayanna...I really wish 
you&#151;&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; She pressed her lips to Hero&#39;s mouth and kept them there. &quot;Just 
hold me. And let me stay for dinner.&quot;

&quot;You can stay the night if you want,&quot; she offered. &quot;I...got you a 
present.&quot;

&quot;You did?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hm. Did you get me one?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she whispered seductively. &quot;You can unwrap it...when you get to 
bed.&quot; The two giggled and spent quite a bit of &quot;quality time&quot; on that 
couch, and only moved to avoid a scolding from the parents. After all, 
it was Christmas. Why waste it sitting on one&#39;s bottom?

So Ayanna helped trim the tree, which by Love family custom, was never 
even put up until the 24th. There were no presents under the tree, 
partially to prevent peeking, but also to increase the surprise. Hero&#39;s 
parents assured her that, as a friend of the family, she would have a 
present under the tree the coming morning, but more importantly, she 
would have a place at the table and in their home, even if she and Hero 
broke up. Their kindness made her eyes misty, so she excused herself to 
the bathroom.
If only...pops were here...

She came back and gave Hero a hug. They danced, the whole group of them, 
until it was time for evening services. Even Ayanna, who shied away from 
churches usually, attended some kind of Christmas service (and Easter, 
of course)&#151;it just seemed expected. The whole family packed itself into 
one car and drove off, braving a gentle snowfall and a 
quickly-approaching night sky. They wouldn&#39;t be able to see the stars 
because of the cloud cover, which was a pity, since astronomical 
observation was also a Love family Yuletide tradition. But a White 
Christmas was just as good.

Ayanna sat with Hero&#39;s family during the service. She held Hero&#39;s hand 
most of the time. She didn&#39;t take communion nor did she give up an 
offering (as a guest, she was discouraged anyway). She sang all songs 
she knew&#151;of course, carols and hymns were roughly the same thing during 
December&#151;and even bowed her head and closed her eyes for prayer. Hero 
knelt.

God... Is there a God? I must believe in Him now, because the girl I 
love believes in Him. Even though she loves me in an &quot;improper&quot; way, she 
still calls herself a Christian, and still believes God loves her. I 
wish I knew more about what God thought about our relationship&#151;not other 
gay couples, but us specifically. Are we doing the right thing? Are we 
sinning? Am I just lying to myself every time I come here? Should I 
break up with Hero and let her commune with other &quot;believers&quot;? It is 
said that believers should not be unequally yoked, and if so, this is 
about as unequal as it gets. God help me.

Dear God, I love her, but I don&#39;t know what to do. Show me your will, O 
Lord. Please soften other people&#39;s hearts, and remind them that everyone 
has sinned. They cannot point out ours and overlook their own. Let them 
see how much we love each other; we mean no harm. Dear Lord, please walk 
into Ayanna&#39;s mother&#39;s life, and let her see what she has done. I hope 
she comes around and takes Ayanna back, but if it is Your will, we will 
take her into our home. I know I am not to be unequally yoked, but I 
feel as if...I can make a change in her life.

God, hear my prayer. Amen.

&quot;Lovely service,&quot; commented father Love. Mother Love agreed and gave 
sweet hugs all around, even to Ayanna. She replied, albeit stiffly, but 
loosened as Hero hugged/tackled her. A few people stared as they kissed, 
but Hero didn&#39;t seem to mind. One came up and cleared his throat.

&quot;Hero...may I speak to you for a moment alone, please?&quot;

&quot;Chuck, whatever you&#39;ve got to say, you can say it in front of the 
people I love.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t mind,&quot; said her mother. They excused themselves and took 
Ayanna with them, leaving their daughter alone. She sighed and stuffed 
her hands in her pockets.

&quot;Chuckles, I know what you&#39;re gonna say, but we love each other.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not here to judge you, Hero. I just want you to be careful, to 
consider what you&#39;re doing. You know what we believe.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot;

&quot;Hero...if this is a struggle&#151;&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not!&quot; she blurted angrily. Chuck was quiet. She sighed. &quot;Actually, 
it is. Constantly. I want to do the right thing, and I want to be with 
her, and I keep on hoping that the two will end up being the same thing, 
or at least agreeing.&quot;

&quot;But you know...&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she whispered. She reached out to hug him, and held on tight. 
&quot;It&#39;s hard, Chazz. It really is. I don&#39;t even see myself as bisexual 
anymore, just...in love. I&#39;m in love with her, and right now, she needs 
that love in her life.&quot;

&quot;...I think God can justify that at least,&quot; he said. She grinned weakly, 
and let go.

&quot;Look, Chazz, I gotta pray about this some more. I mean, no matter what, 
Ayanna needs my love. I&#39;m just...sort of being drawn to her the more 
love I give her. And you know me, I&#39;m all about Love.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; They shared a grin and shook hands. &quot;Well, it was nice seeing 
you. I gotta run, though. Please take care of yourself. I do encourage 
you to love her, but just...be careful. Okay?&quot;

&quot;Will do. Feliz Navidad.&quot;

&quot;Bien Noel to you too.&quot;

&quot;Who was that?&quot; asked Ayanna as Hero rejoined her family.

&quot;My youth minister. He&#39;s cool.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

.........

T&#39;was the Evening of Christ&#39;s Mass and all through the pad

There were plenty of Sapphic fantasies to be had

Hero was snuggled in bed with her jammies so light

And Ayanna, her sweetie, was out for the night

No doubt squeamish for gifts and her beloved&#39;s own presence

Dreaming of chestnuts and pudding and ripe roasted pheasants

Ayanna&#39;s two hands reached out for her Love

And squeezed round her tummy like ye old turtledove

Higher they&#39;d go, till&#39; they wrapt round the breast

And there on Love&#39;s bosom did two tender hands rest

Love, for her part, was honestly horny

And wished, but to God, that soon it would be morny

Her hands traveled south and touched her special place

Wishing, not to visit, but in fact for a race!

She could feel Ayanna&#39;s whispering breath on her head

Saying &quot;I love you, dear Hero,&quot; her face turning red

So around did she turn to embrace Montgomery

To kiss her silky neck and to rub her tummery

And hotter, they&#39;d go, but for Hero&#39;s anxious words

&quot;I love you, Ayanna, but this is for the birds.

We can&#39;t have sex, see, certainly not on this night

Christmas is the one year I don&#39;t want such a plight

So hold me close, yea, and touch my pale skin

But please, O beloved, with not so much din

For I sleep now, but barely; I wish we could screw

I&#39;d rather abstain, love, because I love you.&quot;

And Ayanna, dear duck, saw the smile in her girl

And then did her lips, O blessed, did curl!

&quot;Hero,&quot; she whispered, &quot;now I do love you more

For it is your belief that has this eve scored

Your ideals are beloved, your faith is so sweet

I agree; so now to Slumberland must we meet

And dream of what may, what might, and what will.&quot;

The two then did sleep, their sex was now nil

And soon the sun rose, though clouded in snow

And away, to the tree, did the two lovebirds go!

T&#39;was the morning of Christmas, and all through the house

Every creature was stirring, except for the mouse.

Because Mr. Love set traps.

As was custom, the youngest members of the Love family opened their 
presents first. They had three gifts each, plus a stocking full of small 
candies and toys; Hero, the eldest female child, waited patiently and 
made little comments as her brother and sister tore into their presents. 
What a mess! She herself playfully shook a few before unwrapping them: 
one was a better television, which she had been asking for since July 
(her old one was pretty much dead), and another was, of course, her 
favorite movie on DVD, The Magnificent Seven. She gave daddy a kiss for 
that, then opened her third.

Hero Teresa Minerva Love was speechless as she unveiled before her 
family and girlfriend a gorgeous, long, strapless white dress, decorated 
brilliantly. It had plainly cost a fortune, and was obviously meant to 
be worn at prom and other special events. She gasped and embraced both 
her folks, then promised to try it on once Ayanna opened her gifts. As a 
guest, she was entitled to go first, but seeing the gleam in the younger 
children&#39;s eyes gave her a very generous feeling, and she relinquished 
her turn.

She found it strange to receive gifts from her girlfriend&#39;s parents, but 
she was thankful anyway. Mr. Love had wisely bought her a phone card so 
she could keep in contact with Hero for at least another month, and Mrs. 
Love had found a nice lamp she believed Ayanna would like (she did). 
Hero&#39;s gift, however, was special: a homemade photo album of the two, 
plus a homemade necklace with a special locket, plus a bracelet and a 
hair scrunchie she knew Ayanna needed (topped with a kiss). The two 
embraced, and once the mess was cleaned up, boxes recycled and things 
cleared away, papa Love invited everyone for a nice breakfast.

So Ayanna spent Christmas with a family that was not hers, yet felt more 
like her own relatives than anyone she had known. Once she had some free 
time, the first person she used the phone card on was her mother, 
calling her to try and speak. She got no answer from home. Holiday blues 
indeed.

&quot;You think she&#39;s still mad?&quot; asked Hero, wearing a cute red Santa hat. 
Ayanna sighed.

&quot;Knowing her, she&#39;ll be pissed for the rest of the year.&quot;

&quot;Give it time, babe,&quot; she encouraged with a kiss. &quot;Try again some other 
time. Right now, I got a dress I gotta model!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and a few more photos we need to add to this book.&quot; Still, 
despite their festive mood, part of Ayanna&#39;s mind was still in a slough. 
Thoughts of her mother, her position with the church and God, the 
constant friction she and Hero ran into at church, and the kindness of 
the Love family tugged at her. She was in exile; she truly felt home. 
She was alone; she was beloved. She was both atheistic and joyful to the 
Lord; she moped in the middle of falling snow and sang Hallelujah.

I&#39;ve heard there was
a secret chord
That David played, and
it pleased the Lord
But you don&#39;t really care
for music, do you?
It goes like this:
The fourth, the fifth
the minor fall, the major lift
the baffled king
Composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong
But you needed proof
You saw her bathing
On the roof
Her beauty and the
Moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne
And she cut your hair
And from your lips
She drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe I&#39;ve been here before
I know this room
I&#39;ve walked this floor
I used to live alone
Before I knew you

I&#39;ve seen your flag
On the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It&#39;s a cold and
It&#39;s a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

There was a time
You let me know
What&#39;s really going on below
But now you never show
It to me, do you?
I remember when
I moved in, you
Your holy dark
Was moving too
And every breath we drew
Was Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there&#39;s a God above
And all I ever
Learned from love
Was how to shoot
At someone
Who outdrew you
It&#39;s not a cry
You can hear at night
It&#39;s not somebody
Who&#39;s seen the light
It&#39;s a cold and
It&#39;s a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
