<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Misty stretched and let out a sign of content then rolled over to look 
Jessica in the eyes, &quot;Thank you again.&quot;

&quot;Your welcome.&quot; Jessica replied and lightly kissed the girl upon the 
forehead. She felt Misty&#39;s hand upon her stomach as it slid towards her 
pants. 

&quot;How shall I repay you?&quot; Misty inquired with a grin as she rubbed her 
hand across the crotch of Jessica&#39;s pants and smiled playfully at the 
girl.

Jessica quickly got out of the bed and picked her shirt off the ground, 
&quot;I have to get going.&quot; She stated with a sudden edge to her voice.

&quot;Already?&quot; Misty sat up in bed and let out a disappointed pout, &quot;You are 
always running of on me. When do I get a taste?&quot; She friskily requested.

Jessica slipped on her shirt without a word and got to her feet. 

&quot;I&#39;ll talk to you later alright?&quot; Misty&#39;s asked in desperation, as if 
she feared that Jessica would never return to her, &quot;You know I&#39;m always 
here for you.&quot; She reminded Jessica as the dorm head gripped the 
doorknob. 

Jessica lowered her head; &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; She remarked numbly then 
opened the door and stepped out into the hall. The moment the door 
closed Jessica felt tears fill her eyes, she felt so dirty, as if she 
had just betrayed someone dear to her heart. Her head hurt even worse 
then before and the ache in her heart was overwhelming her senses, this 
was not like her at all. She brought her fingers to her nose and 
breathed in the sweet scent. That delicious smell didn&#39;t even brighten 
her mood; it instead made her feel even worse, never mind the fact that 
now she could feel something else welling up inside of her. She turned 
to head back to her room when she spotted Kris coming around the corner 
and even more guilt washed over Jessica. She quickly hid her hand behind 
her back and felt trapped. 

Hastily Jessica made a u-turn and ran down the hall, hoping that Kris 
had not spotted her, down to the lobby. When she stepped into the lobby 
she discover many girls crowding around the couches giggling and 
squealing. Not prepared to deal with people she slipped passed the 
girls, took out her keys and unlocked the door to the office, ducked in 
and then closed the door. Pleased to see that the steel blinds were 
still pulled down she locked the door and flopped down into her chair to 
catch her breath. 

She could feel a pressure swell up inside the pit of her stomach; it 
made her feel sick and disgusted. She clenched her arm around her waist 
and removed her glasses to rubbed at the tears the threatened to burst 
free of their bounds. She dropped the glassed to the counter, and then 
pressed the heel of her palm against her crotch. It twitched in that 
irritating fashion that bothered Jessica so much. She grabbed at her 
crotch as tears streamed down her cheeks. Unable to hold herself back 
any longer, and wanting that infernal feeling to leave her alone, she 
unbuttoned her pants and shoved her hand into her boxers. The dampness 
of her boxers made the tears flow all the more steadier. A sense of 
embarrassed guilt surged through her body and she felt hot all over. Her 
stomach lurched and she felt the need to throw up, but forced it back. 
Her eyes clenched tight she pushed two fingers deep inside of herself, 
silently sobbing as she masturbated. The feeling of her own cum running 
over her hands made her quicken the pace as she wanted to get to the end 
as quickly as she could. She was relieved to find that she was already 
close to coming after her time with Misty and bit down hard upon her lip 
as the sensation of a small orgasm washed over her and with it the 
welled up feelings were swept away. 

She cried as she pulled out her hand and looked upon the sticky 
substance that coated her fingers.  Quickly she rushed to the sink in 
the back of the office, that was usually used for emergencies and at 
this moment Jessica felt it was one. She turned on the tap and plunged 
her hands under the warm water, frantically trying hard to scrub that 
substance and scent from her skin. This was not like her, she was 
getting better, and she was not affected by this kind of thing any 
longer. She filled her hands with water and splashed it upon her face, 
trying to remove any amount of cum that may still be there upon her 
lips, and then returned to her hands, pumping a mound of liquid soap 
into her hands and scouring them clean. She tried to convince herself to 
stop, that she was in control and could stop scrubbing at any moment, 
but she could not find the strength to end. It took ever ounce of will 
power to pull away from the sink. She found a toothbrush and tooth paste 
in the top cabinet, that she had left there after becoming the dorm 
head, and vigorously ran it across her teeth, trying to remove the 
remaining taste of Misty from her mouth. When she was finished she 
turned off the water and watched the tap drip. Even after all that 
washing she still felt dirty, but it wasn&#39;t as bad as before. After 
forcing the tears back into their cage, as she dried her hands with some 
paper towels and finally mustered the courage to step out of the office 
and see what would cause such a bustle so early in the morning. She 
zipped up her pants and took a deep breath before opening the door.

&quot;What do we have here this early in the morning?&quot; Jessica inquired 
curiously, forcing her voice to not let on how much she was struggling. 
The girls parted for the Dorm Head to get a look at what all the 
commotion was about. 

&quot;Hey Jessica!&quot; Jenn waved to the girl from her spot on the couch.

 Jenn and Natalie had changed out of their nightclothes and were sitting 
to either side of a small girl, who Jessica assumed must be a junior 
high student. The new girl wore a part of brown shorts that cut off at 
the knees and a tight white T-shirt; a long cloak was tied around her 
neck and flowed over her shoulders, her tattoos long since disappeared, 
&quot;Morning.&quot; The girl said with a shy wave. 

Jessica blinked at the new girl, &quot;Who is she?&quot; She asked pointing at the 
girl in confusion, &quot;Head Mistress Sophia never mentioned a new kid 
coming here?&quot;

The girl stood to her feet and gave a light bow, &quot;I am Aigneis&#39;s sister, 
Keelia, but I prefer to be called Kai.&quot;  She explained politely, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry to cause such a fuss so early. I was told my sister lived here.&quot;

&quot;Aigneis?&quot; Jessica shook her head in puzzlement. 

&quot;She is Kris&#39;s sister.&quot; Natalie explained with half a smile. 

&quot;Kris!?!&quot; Jessica took a closer look at Kai and noticed that the girl&#39;s 
eyes were different colours; the right one was a light blue and the left 
a bright yellow. When Kai blinked and the colours switched sides, now 
blue on the left and yellow on the right and continued to switch place 
every time the girl closed her eyes for any reason, &quot;Her sister!?!&quot; 
Jessica stood straight up and glanced around at the growing crowd. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t know Kris had a sister.&quot; One of the girls squealed.

&quot;She is so adorable.&quot; Another added, &quot;I love her eyes.&quot;

&quot;Do you have a girlfriend?&quot; Piped up yet another causing the girls to 
explode in another round of squeals and chatter. 

Jessica shook her head in dismay then turned to the crowd, &quot;That is 
enough.&quot; She commanded, &quot;I&#39;m sure our new visitor doesn&#39;t need to be 
interrogated by a group of horny girls so if you don&#39;t mind could you 
all get your breakfast and head off to school or I&#39;ll withhold your 
allowances.&quot; She demanded with her tone of authority that had gained her 
the position of Head Dorm Girl in the first place. Once the crowd began 
to disperse Jessica turned back to the newcomer. 

&quot;Okay.&quot; Jessica stared down at the little girl, &quot;Now what brings you 
here?&quot; She interrogated taking a seat across from the girls and lacing 
her hands together in front of herself, &quot;uhhh...What was your name 
again?&quot;

&quot;You can call me Kai.&quot; Kai stated with a smile, &quot;Aunt Sophia told me I 
could find Aigneis here. Is she awake yet?&quot; She inquired with slight 
excitement in her tone.  

Jessica noticed there was something unusual about this girl&#39;s chipper 
attitude, but felt it not her place to pry. Jessica glanced over her 
shoulder at the stairs, &quot;She was just getting out of the shower when I 
left.&quot; She replied then turned back to the girl and let out a frustrated 
sigh while running her fingers over the stubble on the sides of her 
head. This looked like this was turning into and interesting morning.

A moment later Kris stepped into the lobby, a black neck tie hung 
loosely around the up turned collar of her white dress shirt, her heads 
were plunged deep in the pockets of her black slacks and her head was 
low as if she was lost in her thoughts. 

&quot;Hey Kris!&quot; Jessica called out to her roommate.

Kris glanced around the lobby, spotted her friends across the room and 
started towards them, &quot;Morning everyo-&quot; She stopped abruptly when she 
spotted Kai sitting amongst the girls.

&quot;Aigneis!!&quot; Kai jumped to her feet at the sight of her sister and ran to 
her.

Kris froze at the presence of the girl, &quot;Kai?&quot; She could not believe 
what she was seeing. Her shock quickly turned to hostility, &quot;What are 
you doing here?&quot; There was an edge to her voice that stopped Kai dead in 
her tracks. 

&quot;I just arrived home.&quot; Kai explained shyly, &quot;I thought you would have 
missed me.&quot; There was mournfulness in the girl&#39;s eyes. 

Kris glared angrily at the girl, &quot;I thought I told you not to come 
around here ever again.&quot; 

&quot;I can go where I want too.&quot; Kai stated furiously, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you 
would just leave home because dad would not listen to you.&quot;

&quot;It is more complicated then that.&quot; Kris explained glimpsing at Jenn, 
who had got to her feet and seem to be considering joining them then 
reconsidered. Kris quickly turned her eyes back to Kai, &quot;You would not 
understand.&quot; She uttered.

&quot;I&#39;m not a child anymore, Aigneis.&quot; Kai shouted there were tears welling 
up in her eyes, &quot;You are not the only one to fall in love.&quot; She blurted 
out.

Kris suddenly moved towards the girl and knelt so they were nearly 
eye-to-eye with each other, &quot;What did you do?&quot; She coldly whispered so 
only the two of them could hear, &quot;Did you give father their soul like 
the good little death angel that you are?&quot; She demanded accusingly. 

Kai lowered her head, &quot;No... I...&quot; She gazed up into her sister&#39;s eyes 
as tears rolled down a cheek. 

Kris&#39;s expression softened. She understood the pain in her sister&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She knelt down and wrapped her arms around the girl, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She hugged the girl tightly. Again she glanced over at 
Jenn, who paced near the couch. Was this really the path of an angel of 
death? To never love and to always be in pain? She was not sure she 
wanted to know the answer to that question.
