<h1>The Student and the Goddess (part 13 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>      &quot;It&#39;s been five days...&quot; Krystal murmured, her head banging against the table in 
frustration. &quot;Really? I think it&#39;s only been four...&quot; Isaka said, trying to make her 
girlfriend feel better. They had yet to hear from Erin - now a goddess - and Abby still 
wasn&#39;t letting them live it down.

      &quot;Hmm... maybe she&#39;s lost somewhere, with multiple abrasions thanks to that ritual,&quot; 
the young mother sad thoughtfully. She received forlorn, pleading looks from the couple. 
Right now, Abby was preparing them breakfast. Seth and Tycara were out and about while Eveon 
and Mina were at school.

      Still no sign of Erin. &quot;I know Seth said she would be disillusioned, but what could 
have happened?&quot; Isaka shrugged at Krystal&#39;s question. &quot;If the trauma was that bad, she&#39;s 
either still recovering, or... maybe she doesn&#39;t remember a thing.&quot;

      Abby looked up from her cooking. &quot;That makes sense. If I were kidnapped thanks to some 
nitwits who supposed to protect me and I had to endure a traumatic experience, I might not 
remember much either.&quot;

      So she wasn&#39;t really helping, but Abby lived off tormenting others. &quot;I guess you guys 
just wait.&quot; They simultaneously sighed as Abby set the food on the table. 

***** 

      Erin awoke with a yawn before sitting up. She felt a lot better... She looked around 
the room, wondering where Faye was. Last she remembered, they were cuddling in the bed, 
but... The older woman was nowhere to be found.

      Just as she thought that, Faye came out of the bathroom, still only partially dressed. 
She took off her shirt without a care in the world and started to root around in her dresser 
for another. Faye suddenly turned around and smiled, a shirt grasped loosely in her hand. 
&quot;Good morning Erin! You&#39;re up particularly early.&quot;

      Erin just nodded and looked away, seeing as Faye was only in a bra and panties... but 
something caught her eye. She looked back and noticed something pink on Faye&#39;s left breast. 
It wasn&#39;t bright pink, but a light sort of dull pink.

      &quot;Like what you see?&quot; Erin jerked her head back up to Faye&#39;s face, feeling really 
embarrassed. The other woman was just smiling. Her words sounded harmless enough, but the 
way Faye said them... This was not a great way to the start the day.

      Faye started walking over to the bed, leaving the shirt on the edge. She got on it and 
kneeled right in front of Erin. &quot;If you wanted to look at my mark, you could have just 
asked.&quot; Erin couldn&#39;t help looking at it now, seeing as how Faye&#39;s chest was only a few 
inches away.

      Erin could now tell that it looked more like a tattoo, with jagged edges and swirls. 
It reminded her of something, but- Her thoughts were cut off as Faye let one hand settle on 
the side of Erin&#39;s neck. &quot;I think yours is prettier...&quot; She let her fingers trace the 
pattern on Erin&#39;s neck and it was then that she realized that Faye&#39;s tattoo was similar to 
hers... but the pattern was different.

      Something was going on. &quot;You wanna touch it?&quot; Faye grabbed Erin&#39;s hand and before she 
could react, it was cupping Faye&#39;s breast. Erin gaped before jerking it back. Faye just 
winked at her aghast expression and laughed. The red head got off the bed and put on the 
shirt before putting on a pair of jeans. &quot;I have to go run the shop, so if you need anything 
just call.&quot; With that, she pinned/clipped her hair up into a messy bun before placing a cap 
on her head.

      Erin wondered if she used magic to get her hair to fit. As soon as her hair was up and 
covered, Erin got the strange feeling that Faye was different... like something changed. 
&quot;Why... do you always hide your hair like that?&quot;

      Faye stopped and looked thoughtful. &quot;Erin... do you feel any different when I have my 
hair down?&quot; Erin tilted her head in thought. &quot;A little bit... but it&#39;s like something about 
you changes when your hair is down or up. I don&#39;t know... I&#39;m probably just delirious...&quot;

      Faye sighed and played with the bill of her cap. &quot;Oh, Erin...&quot; She gave her a devious 
smile. &quot;I meant, do you find me more attractive when my hair is down?&quot;

      Erin just stared at her. &quot;Um... I... guess? I guess you&#39;re prettier when you let your 
hair down, but it doesn&#39;t make that much of a difference - b-b-b-but I&#39;m not attracted to 
you like that or anything, um...&quot;

      Faye looked vaguely disappointed and started out the door. &quot;I had a feeling you would 
say that. You&#39;ve never been an easy one to impress.&quot;

      Erin watched her leave and realized that those cryptic words only added to her 
mounting suspicion that she had met Faye before... but when? 

***** 

      Erin stared up at the ceiling. Things were clearer now. She had a feeling... that she 
wasn&#39;t human anymore. Maybe it was because of the hair or her eyes, but she could just feel 
it. Something. There was something different about her. It was at Abby&#39;s house that she&#39;d 
been taken to. It was starting to make sense.

      She was just scared about what she&#39;d become. It felt... good. It felt like she was 
supposed to be this... whatever she was. So now she was starting to remember who she was and 
what had happened. She was kidnapped by some person and now she was that person?

      Erin racked her brain and sat up on the bed. She wished she could find the answer to 
it all. Something to do with snakes... there was something to do with snakes...! She flopped 
down on the bed with a sigh. She was still tired. Maybe she would think about it later.

      With that, Erin fell asleep and entered a dream that would help her remember. 

***** 

      The setting was familiar, but this time Erin could tell her feet were dangling in a 
river. She didn&#39;t have to look up to know someone was behind her. The person stood there 
impatiently, as though waiting for Erin to turn around or speak. She didn&#39;t do either 
because she wouldn&#39;t mind being left alone.

      With a huff, the person sat down next to her instead and Erin soon realized it was the 
woman from the other dreams. Her cloudy mind was starting to make sense of it all. They sat 
there in silence for a while before Erin spoke. &quot;I thought... I was frustrating.&quot;

      The woman pursed her lips before looking away. &quot;I&#39;m just bored, that&#39;s all. Don&#39;t 
think I actually want to talk to you...&quot; Erin just looked at her. She still couldn&#39;t tell 
what the woman looked like. &quot;Do I really act that different from everyone else?&quot;

      The woman nodded and even in that action she seemed upset. &quot;...then are you here 
because I don&#39;t act the same?&quot; The woman did nothing, but look away. Erin was starting to 
get it. &quot;It&#39;s because everyone else panders you and I don&#39;t. The only reason you&#39;re here is 
because you want to see why I don&#39;t treat you the same.&quot;

      Maybe, if Erin was lucky, her dream woman would get mad and leave again. Instead the 
woman just sat there. &quot;...why do you treat me different?&quot; Erin just looked over at her. 
&quot;...I don&#39;t know. I barely know you. Any time we&#39;ve talked, you&#39;ve been nothing but a rude 
brat.&quot; It no longer felt like she was talking, but the words came out of her mouth.

      The dream woman opened her mouth to retort, but shut it suddenly. &quot;Fine. I... I&#39;m 
sorry.&quot; Erin didn&#39;t expect that. The two of them sat in silence together. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll try to 
be nicer...&quot; The woman murmured.

      Erin gave her a confused look. &quot;You don&#39;t have to... I mean, if everyone is kind to 
you, why should you care about me...?&quot; The woman pouted. &quot;I think your opinion matters a 
lot; I&#39;ve never met someone able to resist me.&quot;
