<a href="../original/dreamday-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>&quot;Is she going to be alright?&quot; Sarah inquired concerned about Kris, whom 
just sat at the table staring blankly at the wall. 

&quot;She will be fine.&quot; Tanya pulled out her wallet, &quot;I&#39;m going to order 
something to eat. Do you want anything?&quot; She asked Sarah, &quot;My treat.&quot; 
She said with a smile.

&quot;Just a cheese burger and root beer will do.&quot; Sarah replied without 
really thinking. 

&quot;Kris, you want your usual?&quot; Tanya waves a hand at the girl to get her 
attention. 

Kris blinked a few times shaking the memories away then slowly nodded. 
She was visibly shaken and hugging herself tightly. 

Tanya turned to Sarah, &quot;You stay with her, alright?&quot; She pointed at the 
spot next to Kris, &quot;And don&#39;t worry. She will pull herself together. She 
is tough like that.&quot; Tanya ran off to get into line. 

Sarah slowly sat down on the bench next to Kris. The girl slid away, 
huddling in the corner of the bench. She seemed terrified of something. 
After a few moments Sarah finally spoke, &quot;Kris, it is just me.&quot; Sarah 
ventured softly. 

Kris turned her head to look at Sarah, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just...&quot; Her voice 
was shaky and she kept licking her lips. 

&quot;It is alright.&quot; Sarah acknowledged setting her hands on her knees, &quot;By 
the way, Thank you for chasing that boy off.&quot; 

Kris straightened herself up a little in her spot, &quot;I don&#39;t like getting 
angry.&quot; Kris admitted in a distance voice. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t hurt anyone.&quot; Sarah assured Kris, fiddling with the hem of 
her jean skirt, &quot;If you hadn&#39;t saved me I don&#39;t think that boy would 
have left me alone.&quot; Sarah closed her eyes, &quot;I was terrified before you 
showed up.&quot; She shuddered at the thoughts that invaded her mind.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry we were late.&quot; Kris confessed guiltily, &quot;Tanya was helping me 
find something to wear.&quot; 

Sarah turned to look Kris over, &quot;You look good.&quot; Sarah blushed. 

&quot;You really think so?&quot; Kris opened her leather jacket to look at her 
shirt, than eyed Sarah for the first time that night. The girl was 
wearing a short jean skirt (that made it hard to Kris not to stare at 
the girl&#39;s bare legs), a white blouse with puffy shoulders and a jean 
vest. Her hair was held up in the pony with a pink scrunchie, &quot;You look 
very pretty.&quot; Kris complimented, glad that she didn&#39;t stay home tonight. 

&quot;Th.. Thanks...&quot; Sarah stammered flushing deeper. 

&quot;Food is served.&quot; Tanya arrived with a tray of food and drinks, &quot;Eat up 
girls.&quot; She set the tray down in the middle of the table and took a seat 
opposite Kris, &quot;Here you go, One double cheese with bacon and an orange 
pop.&quot; She informed Kris as she picked up a burger and drink, then set 
them in front of the girl, &quot;How you feeling there?&quot; Tanya said to Kris.

&quot;I&#39;ll live... I always do...&quot; Kris shrugged as she grabbed the burger, 
unwrapped and proceeded to pull off all the lettuce and tomatoes. 

Sarah gave the girl an odd look, &quot;Don&#39;t you like lettuce and tomatoes?&quot; 
She enquired, confused by her friend behaviour. 

&quot;I don&#39;t like any kind of veggie.&quot; Kris explained scraping off the 
onions and pickles, &quot;I dislike green even more. I&#39;m a true carnivore.&quot; 
She put the burger back together and was about to eat it when she 
noticed the way Sarah was staring. She suddenly felt embarrassed and set 
the burger down. 

Tanya broke the tension that came over the table, &quot;Veggies are really 
tasty, If you are talking vegetarians that is.&quot; She gave Kris a broad 
grin. 

Kris reddened, &quot;Tanya!!!&quot; She shouted.

&quot;Vegetarians...&quot; Sarah stared at Tanya baffled, then turned to Kris, 
&quot;What does she mean?&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t want to know.&quot; Kris picked up her burger and took a bite, 
&quot;Tanya just likes to make me blush.&quot; 

&quot;Ahhhh...&quot; Sarah slowly picked up her drink and sipped on it, &quot;Tanya 
have you tasted a Vegetarian?&quot; She asked mystified. 

Tanya choked on her burger and grabbed for her drink. Sarah broke into 
giggles, &quot;You little.&quot; Tanya coughed, &quot;You knew exactly what we were 
talking about didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Sarah looked innocent, &quot;I have no idea. I just asked if you really 
knew.&quot; 

Tanya blinked and turned to Kris, &quot;I think we have to be careful with 
this one.&quot; 

&quot;I already know that.&quot; Kris tried to ignore the two of them and finish 
her burger. 

They finished eating quickly and Tanya looked at her watch, &quot;We&#39;d better 
get going. The club is not far from here.&quot; She stood up and stretched. 

&quot;Okay.&quot; Sarah stood and straightened her skirt. 

Kris could not help watching. Shaking her head she slid out from her 
corner, &quot;I&#39;ll get the dishes.&quot; She proposed as she started to gather the 
garbage onto the tray and left the two girls to find a garbage bin. She 
finally found one in the far corner and tossed out the garbage before 
setting the tray on top of the bin. When she turned around she could see 
Tanya and Sarah talking. As she approached the girls, it appeared that 
Sarah&#39;s expression had changed. Like she had something deep on her mind. 

&quot;Sarah, you alright?&quot; Kris wondered, &quot;You seem kind of low.&quot; She stared 
at Tanya, &quot;Tanya what did you say to her?&quot; 

&quot;Only the truth.&quot; Tanya slung her back pack over her shoulder. 

&quot;Tanya!&quot; Kris glared at her friend, &quot;What did you tell her?&quot; 

&quot;It was nothing.&quot; Sarah confirmed putting on a fake smile joining the 
girls as they prepared to leave the diner with Tanya leading the way.

&quot;You sure you are alright?&quot; Kris asked holding the door open for Sarah. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Sarah replied, &quot;I&#39;m just nervous about going to a club 
for the first time. You are sure this is a Youth Group, because I&#39;m not 
old enough to enter a bar.&quot;

&quot;How old are you?&quot; Kris was taken by surprise, amazed at herself for 
never asking before. 

&quot;Seventeen.&quot; Sarah answered, &quot;And you?&quot;

&quot;Eighteen. Same with Tanya.&quot; Kris nodded towards her friend who was 
walking in front of them not really part of the conversation. 

Sarah startled, &quot;I thought you were younger then me!!&quot; She exclaimed, 
&quot;You don&#39;t look that old. When I first met you I thought you were just 
another niner.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kris admitted shyly, &quot;Everyone confused me for being my little 
sister&#39;s twin and she is 2 year younger than me. They still won&#39;t let me 
into R rated movies thinking my ID is fake.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;She still wear kids panties too.&quot; Tanya proclaimed turning around to 
walk backwards so she could join the conversation.

Kris blushed, &quot;Will you quit it!&quot; She snarled at her friend, &quot;You don&#39;t 
need to tell everyone!&quot; 

&quot;But they are so cute!&quot; Tanya commented with a grin, &quot;All those kitty 
prints.&quot; 

&quot;Shut up!&quot; Kris started to chase her friend and jumped onto the girl&#39;s 
back, however she didn&#39;t weigh enough to really effect the girl and 
Tanya continued to walk down the street while giving Kris a piggy back. 
Not letting Kris get down. The girls laughed their way down the street. 

After a few moments they came to a stop, &quot;We&#39;re here!!&quot; Tanya called out 
to the two girls in excitement. 

&quot;Where?&quot; Kris examined the surroundings. The sun had slowly gone down 
and they found themselves standing on a small darkly lit road with lots 
of trees all around them. A small office building could be seen to their 
right and a run down old warehouse stood off the left, with it&#39;s windows 
all boarded up and it looked uninhibited.

Tanya was pointing at the warehouse with glee, &quot;There!&quot; 

&quot;THAT THING!?!&quot; Kris exclaimed in confusion staring at the structure. 

&quot;We are going to a warehouse?&quot; Sarah joined Kris&#39;s confusion, &quot;Is this 
one of those raves?&quot; She asked looking up and down the length of the 
building.

&quot;Nope, but the club is inside.&quot; Tanya started to cross the large gravel 
yard that surrounded the building, &quot;Come on.&quot;

&quot;Uhhh...&quot; Kris hesitated to move from her spot, &#39;What have you got us 
into?&#39; She thought to herself. 

Tanya stopped in the middle of the field of pebbles which Kris assumed 
was a parking lot of some sort for there were a couple cars parked off 
near the building, &quot;Come on!&quot; She waved with a broad grin on her face, 
&quot;It may look run down on the outside, but it is great inside. You have 
to see this.&quot; She ran back to her friends and grabbed each by the wrist, 
&quot;You both agreed to come. So lets go.&quot; She started to pull the girls 
along backwards. 

They reached a small set of wooden stairs at the back of the building. 
Tanya ran up the stairs and opened the door, then turned back to her 
friends, &quot;Come on, would you?&quot; 

From where Kris stood she could see that the inside of the building was 
newly renovated with freshly painted red walls and the soft sound of 
music could be heard from within. Kris shrugged to Sarah and started up 
the stairs with the girl close behind her. Inside was a small hall with 
a set of stairs leading up at one end and another set leading down at 
the other. In between the stairwells stood a large door with an even 
larger man in dark clothes standing in front of it. 

&quot;Hiya Tanya.&quot; He greeted her with a smile, &quot;Good to see you back.&quot; He 
then turned to the two other girls, &quot;These friends of yours?&quot; He 
inquired looking the girls over. Sarah half hid behind Kris staring up 
at the man. 

&quot;Yep,&quot; Tanya answered smiling at her friend, &quot;This is Kris and her 
friend Sarah.&quot; Tanya motioned to the two girls, &quot;Girls, this is Kevin. 
He is here to make sure none of the old people try to hit on the kids 
during youth night.&quot; 

&quot;You could say that.&quot; Kevin confirmed with a wink, &quot;You girls can go on 
in. Most of the group is here already.&quot; He opened the door for the 
girls. 

&quot;Great!&quot; Tanya slipped past the man, &quot;Come on guys!&quot; She called out 
behind her. 

Kris and Sarah cautiously passed the man and followed their friend into 
the next room. They were surprised to find themselves standing in a 
large well furnished and clean room. A couple of kids were sitting in 
one of three dining booths with red leather benches that were set along 
the left hand wall. Each had a dim yellow light hanging over the table. 
To the right was a square bar counter with a young boy behind it serving 
cups of coffee to a couple of other kids. A pool table was set in the 
far back with smaller circular tables around it. A dance floor could be 
seen at the very far end of the warehouse. Everything looked new and 
inviting, nothing like the outside of the building. Kris counted no less 
than twenty people in the room ranging from early teens to early 
twenties. 

Tanya walked up to the middle of the room, &quot;Hey everyone!!!&quot; She called 
out waving. A few of the kids waved back at Tanya. 

&quot;Tanya!!!&quot; A small girl dressed in a bright pink dress jumped out from 
her seat at a booth and ran over to the girl, wrapping her arms around 
Tanya&#39;s neck, &quot;I&#39;m so glad to see you!!&quot; The girl squealed, &quot;Where have 
you been???&quot; 

&quot;Sorry Jessie.&quot; Tanya apologized and let out a sigh, &quot;School has been 
keeping me busy mostly.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, long time no see.&quot; A boy in leather pants and a tight neon purple 
tank flounced towards the group of girls, &quot;And who are your cute 
friends?&quot; He marvelled eyeing Kris.

Tanya gave the boy a glare, &quot;She is off limits to you, Clarence.&quot; She 
warned with a sly smile, &quot;I don&#39;t think she swings that way.&quot; 

&quot;Darn, because she looks yummy.&quot; Clarence declared as he slunk over to 
Kris&#39;s side, &quot;To bad you&#39;re not a real boy because... yow!&quot; 

&quot;Clarence!&quot; Tanya used her most commanding voice, &quot;Down boy!&quot;

&quot;Rough!&quot; He barked before leaving the girls alone. 

&quot;Sorry about that.&quot; Tanya excused to Kris, &quot;Clarence is harmless.&quot; 

&quot;Tanya,&quot; The boy acting as bartender spoke up, &quot;Why don&#39;t you introduce 
your friends to the group?&quot; He proposed with a smile. Everyone in the 
room turned to see who the newcomers were. 

&quot;Sure thing, Jeff.&quot; Tanya put her arm around Kris, &quot;Everyone this is my 
best friend Kris.&quot; She loudly introduced her friend so everyone could 
hear, &quot;She was the one who made me realize I was a dyke.&quot; She explained 
with a grin that caused Kris to blush. Kris hated being put on the spot 
like this, &quot;And this here...&quot; Tanya pulled Sarah out from her hiding 
place behind them, &quot;Is our new friend from school, Sarah, she is only 
curious so don&#39;t scare her too much.&quot; 

The girl in pink rushed over to Kris, &quot;So you are the infamous Kris!&quot; 
She piped excitedly, &quot;I&#39;m Jessica, everyone just calls me Jess. Tanya 
told us all about you.&quot; 

&quot;She did, did she?&quot; Kris gave her friend a wry eye, &quot;I wonder what 
stories she told?&quot;

&quot;We were all discussing coming out.&quot; Jessica rattled still excited, 
&quot;Have you come out to your parents yet? I haven&#39;t... I don&#39;t know what 
to say... What about you?&quot; She talked so fast Kris was having troubles 
following the girl. 

&quot;Kris was never in the closet so to say.&quot; Tanya said approaching the 
bar, &quot;Jeff can I get a double-double?&quot; She ordered. 

&quot;Two sugar, two cream coming up.&quot; The boy acknowledged grabbing a cup 
and turned to the coffee machine. 

&quot;Really?!?&quot; Jessica looked at Kris with starry eyes, &quot;So you&#39;ve always 
known?&quot;

&quot;Not really...&quot; Kris felt herself become shy, &quot;I wasn&#39;t really told it 
was wrong so never hid it.&quot; 

&quot;How&#39;d your parents take that?&quot; Jessica asked again. The girl seemed 
filled with questions. 

&quot;They tossed me in a metal hospital.&quot; Kris uttered bluntly causing 
Jessica to suddenly go quiet.

Sarah gently pulled on the sleeve of Kris&#39;s jacket, &quot;What is this 
place?&quot; She whispered, huddling close to Kris trying hard not to stare 
wide eyed at a table where a couple of girls were kissing.

Kris let out a short sigh, &quot;Tanya tricked you.&quot; She explained softly, 
&quot;This is a &#39;gay&#39; youth club. She didn&#39;t tell me until later. Sorry about 
this.&quot; 

&quot;A gay club???&quot; Sarah&#39;s eye widened, &quot;but I&#39;m not... Did you think...?&quot; 
Sarah stammered over her words blushing. 

Kris turned to face the girl, &quot;If you hang around me that is what people 
are going to think.&quot; She clarified disheartened.

Sarah blushed deeper, &quot;I just thought... we could be friends...&quot; She 
said twiddling her fingers. 

&quot;Well then,&quot; Kris spun around, &quot;you&#39;d better get used to this kind of 
thing. I&#39;m not one to hide who I am around anyone.&quot; 

&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry.&quot; Jessica butted in, &quot;Many people come here as 
friends. It is great.&quot; She volunteered with a smile, &quot;I was confused 
when I first came here however now...&quot; She blushed looking over at 
Tanya. 

&quot;Ahhhh...&quot; Sarah exclaimed knowingly, &quot;Yeah some of the girls are cute.&quot; 
She agreed avoiding Kris&#39;s stare. 

&quot;I love the boyish girls.&quot; Jessica said excited again and looking Kris 
over, &quot;You are hot too.&quot; She added, &quot;You two could date and no one would 
know that you are gay?&quot; She quipped bluntly. 

The statement caused Sarah to blush yet more, &quot;I...&quot; She stammered. 

&quot;I&#39;m just teasing.&quot; Jessica smiled, &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll steal her then?&quot; Jessica 
moved closer to Kris only to have the girl step back. 

&quot;You don&#39;t want to get close to me.&quot; Kris glare, something about this 
girl scared Kris. 

&quot;Careful Jessie,&quot; Tanya spoke up at the bar with her coffee in hand, 
&quot;She is a dangerous one.&quot; 

&quot;Awwww...&quot; Jessica put on a long face, &quot;Why not Tanya?&quot; She suddenly 
smiled, &quot;Or do you have your eyes on her?&quot; She inquired. 

&quot;Hey Kris, they have a pool table!!!&quot; Tanya mentioned changing the 
subject and moving to the other end of the room, &quot;Do you still play 
pool?&quot;

&quot;Sort of...&quot; Kris strolled along behind her friend taking in everything 
around her, &quot;I haven&#39;t played in some time though.&quot; Her eyes fell on the 
long pool table. The familiar crack of the cue ball rung in her ears. 
She clenched onto the necklace around her neck as memories of her pool 
playing days rushed into her head. Her dad gave her the eagle necklace 
as well as taught her how to play pool. The eagle was a gift for getting 
awarded &quot;best artist&quot; in junior high school. She also remembered how her 
mother would send her on her bike to all the bars in the area in search 
of her father. It was sad, by the time she turned 11 she was already 
allowed to enter five bars without questions. The owners just waved her 
in. She clenched the eagle tighter as memories of one such day invaded 
her mind.
