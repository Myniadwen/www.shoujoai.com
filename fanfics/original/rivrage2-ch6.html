&quot;Hmm...&quot; 

The birds chirped and the sun shone brightly on the dawn of a new day 
in the bustling city of Tokyo. Deep in its suburbs was Tomeishuu High, 
and in the upper level of the second dormitory block was the young 
genius, Mishizu Yakagi.  

The diamond-eyes of the young girl fluttered open, and she moaned 
slightly, stretching her limbs about as she writhed in bed. With 
another little breath of air, the Yakagi-girl leaned upwards, pulling 
down her bedspread.  

{Wow... I have never felt so relaxed before.} 

Mishizu yawned, then stood up off the bed, thinking about that some 
more. It was true. She had never felt more tranquil in such a 
reasonable amount of time. After all, there was little she could relax 
about. The peace talks between the Cross Blade Lancers and the Spring 
Breeze Assassins had gone up in smoke. A veil of iciness had settled on 
the school, one that was as cold and harsh as ever. On top of that, 
Izumi was an issue.  

And... quite an important one.  

The aquamarine-haired girl released a deep sigh, as thoughts of Izumi 
Wakabashi came to mind. As it had been thought of in her brain, Mishizu 
couldn&#39;t quite understand what was happen with herself and Izumi. They 
had known each other for around three; verging on four years and most 
of that time they had spent arguing. It just so happened that during 
that time, Izumi had been harbouring secret desire for Mishizu. Then 
during that vicious battle with the Kyoto New Force Strikers, Izumi 
revealed that love. Mishizu couldn&#39;t return it, because at the time, 
she herself was in love with Rinako. Even after that, she and Izumi 
managed to sort out their differences and become friends. Then, just 
recently Mishizu began to feel... more than friendship for Izumi. 

But why? 

Surely she was confusing all this. There was no way she could fall in 
love with Izumi... right? After all this time, Mishizu could not really 
get her head around it. One thing she was aware of though, was the 
attraction. Whether she had feelings for Izumi or not, there was no 
denying that Mishizu was attracted to her. Was that a sign of something 
new on the horizon? 

{Dah... I&#39;m never going to be able to figure this all out.} Mishizu 
thought. {I better just get ready for classes.} 

The young girl peered at the clock on her nightstand. It was definitely 
8.10 in the morning, a normal time for Mishizu to be waking up. Without 
worrying about her &#39;Izumi Problem&#39; anymore, the young girl ambled over 
to the wardrobe across her room and pulled out her school uniform. It 
was time for another day at the salt mines. 

********** 

&quot;...Spent the night, huh?&quot; 

Ayane&#39;s pale cheek blushed a deep crimson as she nodded. The young SBA 
leader was poised under the covers of Rinako&#39;s dorm bed, in the dorm 
room shared by the Ikatsuji sisters. While Ayane nodded silently, 
Minato just rolled her eyes knowingly. She had been talking to Natsumi 
the previous night and the shrine girl asked her to water the plants in 
her dorm room while she was gone. The plants in Natsumi&#39;s room were all 
exotic and calming for her and she was allowed to keep them by 
Principle Yagami as a reward for special behaviour. Minato accepted 
that, she&#39;d do anything for Natsumi. Minato then did as she was asked 
and watered the plants. Of course, as soon as she got in the room she 
couldn&#39;t leave. Everything inside it reminded her of Natsumi.  

The curtains, the bed, the Gentatsu Boys and Yusaku Kudo posters, even 
the smell, all of it reminded Minato of her absent girlfriend. Minato 
ended up sleeping in the room all night. Then, when she realized what 
she did the next morning, she dashed over to her dorm, just in case 
Rinako was worrying about her. Then she came back to find a near naked 
Ayane wrapped up in Rinako&#39;s bed sheets.  

&quot;I... I am sorry for this. I came to see Rinako yesterday night; we got 
to talking and one thing led to another. I...&quot; 

Ayane continued to blush, while Minato looked on in disbelief. &quot;So the 
two of you &#39;made it up&#39; huh? You know that she was never really angry 
with you, right?&quot; 

Ayane just nodded. 

&quot;And... here you are. I suppose I can&#39;t blame you. Rinako&#39;s the exact 
same way. Speaking of my sister, where is she?&quot; 

The blush on Ayane&#39;s cheeks fell as she answered. &quot;She left just 
briefly to check up on you. Izumi had informed us that you fell asleep 
in Natsumi&#39;s room so we thought you would be okay with this.&quot; 

Minato scratched the back of her head. &quot;Is there anything going on in 
this school that Izumi *doesn&#39;t* know? Dah... I&#39;m not bothered, 
anyways. I know by now that you two can&#39;t keep your hands off each 
other for very long.&quot;  

&quot;I&#39;m sure that you are the same way with Natsumi.&quot; 

Now it was Minato&#39;s turn to blush. &quot;...Well... Natsumi and I... we&#39;ve 
never... &#39;gone all the way&#39; if you know what I mean. I&#39;d like to... I 
know I love Natsumi... we&#39;ll be together forever, it&#39;s just...&quot; 

&quot;Do not rush things.&quot; Ayane spoke seriously. &quot;Rinako and I... that is 
slightly different. I&#39;ve loved her for years. Had it not been for... 
well, certain complications, I am sure that we would have been together 
in the past two years. We are comfortable with this because... we have 
been in love with each other for so long. For you and Natsumi... time 
is needed. Time to adjust to what you feel. It is an important step... 
one that you should be careful about.&quot; 

Minato smiled a bit. Since when was Ayane so insightful? &quot;Thanks. I 
never knew you were so deep... and since when have we been so easy to 
talk about stuff like this.&quot; 

&quot;Rinako says that I should get to know you better.&quot; Ayane responded. &quot;I 
want to share every part of her life. Plus, you are dating one of my 
two best friends. I suppose it is only right that I should watch out 
for your interests.&quot; 

Minato smiled. This was the first time she and Ayane had ever had a 
serious conversation about anything really. And now that she thought 
about it, it was only right that Minato learn more about Ayane. After 
all, Ayane was her sister&#39;s girlfriend. Minato had known Keiji well, 
why not Ayane? 

Just then the door clicked open, as Rinako passed though absently. 
&quot;Ayane... I can&#39;t find Minato. She not in Natsumi&#39;s...&quot; She then 
stopped herself as she saw her sister. &quot;Minato?&quot; 

Minato raised an eyebrow. &quot;That&#39;s me. You&#39;re up a bit early, aren&#39;t 
you...?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t give me that!&quot; Rinako scolded playfully, ruffling her younger 
sister&#39;s blonde hair with her hand. &quot;Where the heck have you been, huh? 
I was getting a little worried.&quot; 

&quot;I was in Natsumi&#39;s room, then I just came back here. You had a bit of 
a night, didn&#39;t you?&quot; 

Though she was speaking to Minato, Rinako grinned at a pensive Ayane, 
who was staying respectively quiet. &quot;You don&#39;t know the half of it.&quot; 

Ayane blushed again as she decided to speak up. &quot;I do not mean to 
interrupt you two, but could you please hand me my clothes over there?&quot; 

Rinako&#39;s smile fell. &quot;You&#39;re leaving?&quot; 

&quot;Classes start in about fifty minutes, Rinako. And if I&#39;m correct then 
the SBA-CBL war is still active. So if I&#39;m caught here, with me like 
this...&quot; 

&quot;I gotcha...&quot; Rinako admitted sadly. &quot;But it&#39;s already late, can you 
please just stay a little longer?&quot; 

Minato backed away as the two of them got into those traded glances. 
She had the astute idea that the two of them would be joining &#39;souls&#39; 
in like ten minutes. &quot;Uh... I&#39;ll leave you two alone to... do what you 
need to... or want to... I just need my books.&quot; 

Minato quickly gathered together her stuff, packed it into her book bag 
and made her way to the door, but just before she left, she looked back 
at Rinako. &quot;Hey, sis?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah?&quot; 

&quot;Rei was looking for you this morning. I bumped into her outside and 
she said something about being ready to start the real training?&quot; 

Rinako nodded. &quot;I gotcha. Thanks, Minato.&quot; 

&quot;Sure. Seeya!&quot; 

And with that, as the door shut closed, Minato was gone. Leaving behind 
Ayane and Rinako. The younger girl walked over to her bed and sat down 
beside Ayane, staring longing eyes at her.  

Rinako smiled seductively at Ayane. &quot;So... um... where were we?&quot; 

&quot;Hold up a second, Rinako.&quot; Ayane said.  

Rinako pulled back a little. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; 

&quot;Last night you asked me for a favour. To help you train that girl, 
Reikibu. I hate to say this but... do you think it is wise to teach 
someone Rai shou en ken? I mean you barely know her.&quot; 

Rinako just shrugged. &quot;So what? Look, I know it&#39;s dangerous, but Rei 
isn&#39;t some maniac kid who&#39;ll go off on a power trip and blow up the 
town hall. I trust her.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean.&quot; Ayane stated. &quot;Remember, Rai shou en ken was 
banned by the government. Even my use of it is illegal. Only members of 
the Ikatsuji family are allowed to use it.&quot; 

Rinako wrapped her arms around Ayane&#39;s neck and shoulders. &quot;Well... I 
could remedy that... all you&#39;d have to do is marry me...&quot; 

Ayane blushed again. &quot;I am being perfectly serious here, Rinako.&quot; 

&quot;I know, I know. But don&#39;t worry. Rei is trustworthy. And I believe in 
her. You don&#39;t have to worry about anything.&quot; 

********** 

&quot;8.45...&quot;  

Yuji sighed as he stared at the blue watch on his wrist. There was no 
way he would get back to Tengoku Aijin in time for classes. It was the 
early morning and Yuji had left to delivers Keitarou&#39;s message to the 
Cross Blade Lancer&#39;s leader, Rinako. Of course, he had to leave early, 
about 8.00, now here he was, standing in front of the gates to 
Tomeishuu High once more.  

Yuji was not completely comfortable here. It was more than being shy of 
girls. This school had a notorious reputation in Tokyo. The fighters 
within it may have been a bunch of hormonal schoolgirls, but they 
fought with passion and zeal. And it made Yuji worry about Keitarou&#39;s 
chances against Rinako.  

Keitarou was a very powerful fighter; there was no avoiding that. But 
this Rinako Ikatsuji... for her to take down the ruthless Zanga the way 
she did, it had to be an indication of her strength.  

While Yuji stood in front of the gates to the school, weighing his 
options, Mishizu had just turned the corner, coming from the Gyms at 
the west of the situate. As she caught sight of this young boy, Yuji, 
Mishizu mused curiously.  

{Who is this?} Mishizu thought wonderingly. 

Well, there was no sense in wasting time. Mishizu walked over to this 
raven-haired boy, fully prepared to ask the question to his face. Yuji 
looked over to his right as he saw Mishizu coming. 

&quot;Can I help you?&quot; Yuji asked.  

Mishizu&#39;s feet came to a stop. &quot;I was thinking that same thing. If you 
wish to enrol in this school, I am afraid that you are lacking the 
right chromosome. Well, at least the right amount of it.&quot; 

The shy Yuji blushed and looked away. &quot;... I know this school is for 
girls, I have no intention of joining or anything like that.&quot; 

&quot;So then... why are you standing in front of my school?&quot; 

Yuji managed to drag his eyes back to Mishizu. &quot;Do you know a girl 
named Rinako Ikatsuji?&quot; 

Now Mishizu was alert. &quot;...Why do you ask?&quot; 

&quot;Forgive me. I suppose I should introduce myself. My name is Yuji 
Nijuurou. I am second in command of the resurrected Tengoku Dream 
Rebels. My friend, Keitarou Kusako, has an offer of challenge for her. 
It is not territorial or about past differences, Keitarou merely wishes 
to see more of miss Ikatsuji.&quot; 

Though Yuji seemed polite and very sincere, Mishizu did not trust this. 
A lot of people challenged Rinako over the years. When word got out 
that she beat Zanga to a bloody pulp, these challenges were getting 
lower and lower in number. Why would someone take her on now, if they 
weren&#39;t up to something?  

&quot;I&#39;ll give her the message... Yuji.&quot; Mishizu said quietly. 

Yuji nodded in thanks, then turned to walk away, but looked back for a 
few seconds. &quot;Wait... what was your name?&quot; 

&quot;My name is Mishizu.&quot; The diamond eyed girl said. &quot;Mishizu Yakagi.&quot; 

Yuji then smiled, just before walking away. &quot;I thank you, Mishizu 
Yakagi. For speaking with me.&quot; 

Mishizu nodded and then watched Yuji walk away. Though she didn&#39;t 
completely trust Yuji, he looked to be a nice enough person. All the 
same, Rinako would have to hear of this as soon as possible. 

********** 

A great distance from the city Tokyo was the city of Osaka, and in the 
quiet suburbs of this less hectic town, the superior building known as 
the Yakume Shrine stood proud and strong. Deep inside its cavernous 
innards, was the room of Natsumi Yakume, the eldest of the three Yakume 
daughters. Natsumi was sitting serenely on her bed, her pet kitten 
Setsuna nuzzling in her lap, while her two sisters were at the other 
side of the room, eating chocolate, reading magazines and talking about 
their favourite topic, boys.  

Tomomi and Yuri continued to enjoy themselves while Natsumi just 
sighed, managing to bring herself to stroke Setsuna under the ears.  

She had only been here for a few days and she was already missing 
Minato like crazy. The longhaired miko lowered her eyes to her pet 
kitten again, her brain wracked with thoughts of her girlfriend. It was 
bad considering that she had more important things to worry about, such 
as the Shunshibaru crystal. Natsumi&#39;s father, Tetsuya, had convinced 
himself that the crystal&#39;s power lay elsewhere, other than a simple 
tool to track down the seal child. So the two of them had to research 
the crystal in more of their family&#39;s scrolls and books before Aerolust 
re-awakes. Natsumi couldn&#39;t concentrate on any of it. All she was 
thinking of was her Mina-chan.  

{I miss her so much, Setsuna.} Natsumi thought, looking at her cat. {I 
didn&#39;t think I would... I mean it&#39;s not like I&#39;m staying here for good. 
I just need to be around her for a while... and I wish I could tell my 
family about her.} 

&quot;Hey! Wake up sis!&quot; 

With a start, Natsumi&#39;s head jerked up and she realized that both of 
her hyperactive sisters had been calling on her. &quot;Tomomi, Yuri... 
what&#39;s up?&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s up with you?&quot; Yuri said in return. &quot;You&#39;re acting all miserable 
and lovesick... did you meet up with someone in Tokyo?&quot; 

Tomomi beamed. &quot;See? I told you she met a guy there! What&#39;s his name, 
Natsumi? C&#39;mon, tell us!&quot; 

Natsumi looked away. They were right of course. Natsumi was missing a 
significant other. But she couldn&#39;t say anything about it. How could 
she tell them that the guy was a girl? 

&quot;I want to tell you guys... but...&quot; 

Tomomi shook her hands. &quot;Okay, then just tell us about him! Is he 
cute?&quot; 

Natsumi blushed a bit, thinking of her sweet Minato. &quot;Very cute...&quot; 

&quot;Is he smart?&quot; Yuri questioned.  

Natsumi nodded. &quot;Very much so.&quot; 

Tomomi asked another question. &quot;What about his performance? Is he a 
good kisser or what?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Natsumi confirmed it. &quot;My honey-dip is a great kisser. What more 
do you guys wanna know about? Blood type?&quot; 

&quot;Just one thing.&quot; Yuri started seriously. &quot;Do you love him?&quot; 

Natsumi looked downwards, her blush as strong as ever and continued to 
stroke the kitten on her lap. At first, Tomomi and Yuri were confused, 
but then their final question was answered as Natsumi parted her lips 
again. 

&quot;I love my angel with all my heart.&quot;</pre>
