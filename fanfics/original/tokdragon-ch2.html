~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Yoi shakai Marketplace, Tokyo, Japan

&#147;Just one of those salmon would do nicely! Thank you, sir!&#148;

Yoko smiled as the friendly fishmonger withdrew the selected salmon fish 
from the ice with his gloved hands. He immediately dried it off with 
some fresh paper towels, then surrounded the fish in wrapping paper. 
Yoko gratefully received the fish, placed it in the basket at her arm, 
then withdrew some slips of yen. The fishmonger returned Yoko&#146;s smile as 
he was handed the money to pay for the fish.

&#147;You&#146;re in a chipper mood, Yoko,&#148; He said. &#147;I never knew you enjoyed 
grocery shopping so much.&#148;

Yoko shook her head. &#147;Oh no, it&#146;s not because of that. I&#146;m just excited 
because I recently heard from my brother. Plus, I really don&#146;t mind 
shopping more my grandfather. So, I&#146;m going to make him a big meal 
today. Salmon and rice is his favourite.&#148;

&#147;Ho, ho, ho!&#148; The large fishmonger laughed. &#147;You are a good one, Yoko. 
You&#146;ll make some lucky man a very wonderful wife, one day.&#148;

Yoko sweat dropped. There were a few things she didn&#146;t tell people about 
her love life. &#147;Um&#133; thank you, sir. I have to be going now.&#148;

The fishmonger nodded his acceptance, then looked over at the next 
person who wanted to be served, a middle-aged woman. Yoko bounded down 
the long open street, watching everything around her take place. She 
loved markets. She loved the sound of stall owners yelling out the 
prices of their fresh fish, fruit, vegetables and spices to curious 
consumers out for a bargain. She loved how neighbours would meet up with 
each other, make some idle banter and then move on to buy new things 
with their hard-earned money It was a safe, happy community, something 
she never really saw when she was living with her father and brother in 
Sunset City. It made her love Tokyo even more. 

The young girl made her way through the thick crowds, relishing that 
sweet smell of fresh fruits and vegetables out in the wide, sunny open. 
Then this cheer was cut to the side, by the arrogant laugh of some young 
woman, and the sound of a older man&#146;s yelling. Yoko looked to where the 
voices were coming from, the right. A crowd had formed a circle around 
two people. Yoko managed to barge her way through the spectators till 
she reached the first line of people surrounding the centre. Two people 
actually were there, but were vastly different from each other. One was 
a tall hulking man, thick jaw, bald head, ragged clothes, powerful 
stink, and a bad attitude. The other was a young girl, probably the same 
age as Yoko. And the first thing Yoko noted about her was how pretty she 
was. Her wavy, shoulder long ginger hair clung loosely, curving at the 
edges of those tresses. It matched the sweet green of her eyes, and the 
cute freckles on her cheeks. Though she was probably Japanese in origin, 
she seemed to have some American blood in her. She was dressed in some 
blue denim shorts and jacket, and wearing a pair of sandals on her small 
feet. Yoko blushed as she watched this girl face off with the larger 
man. She hadn&#146;t seen a girl this attractive since&#133; well, Yoko didn&#146;t 
feel much like bringing *her* up. 

The redhead in the centre of the crowds circled with the taller man. 
Though it seemed like she was signing her death warrant by trying to 
fight with a man that seemed large enough to snap her in two, there was 
a confident grin on her face. One that seemed to indicate that she 
wasn&#146;t to be taken lightly. 

The taller man, sneering, charged at the girl, who remained still as he 
advanced. The redhead smiled at him, then ran forward, ducking under his 
arms before he could hit her The girl swerved around the guy, jumped up, 
then went to work. She wound her arms under his arms, curling them back, 
then rose her knees up and buried them into his back. The taller man 
stopped as he was, then stumbled to one knee, realizing that he had been 
caught by some form of technique. He slipped downwards so much that he 
fell to two knees. Yoko looked at his eyes. They were slowly slipping 
shut The next thing to touch the ground was his hands, that slapped to 
the soft stone of the street. The redheaded girl tightened her hold on 
the man, grinning like a Cheshire cat, digging her soft knees into his 
weakening back. This hold continued for over a minute, and soon the 
towering man was face down on the floor, completely unconscious. The 
girl climbed off him, still grinning. She removed something from his 
belt, something that looked like a handbag, then got up and walked over 
to the crowds. To an elderly woman. 

&#147;Here, ma&#146;am,&#148; She said. &#147;I believe that this belongs to you.&#148;

The old lady took the handbag and nodded in thanks, mouthing a few words 
that Yoko couldn&#146;t quite understand. The redhead simply nodded, then 
turned back to what obviously was a thief. 

&#147;Humph! What a loser. My Stunner Grab gets &#145;um all the time.&#148;

The crowds began to disperse, almost as if this was not a random 
occurrence. Yoko was one of the few who remained. She was surprised. 
From the &#145;pampered&#146; looks of that girl, Yoko would have never believed 
that she was a martial artist And a half-decent one at that. How many 
girls could have taken down a man twice their size with a body hold like 
that? The redhead had to be very skilled to pull that one off. Yoko, 
almost thoughtlessly, walked up to the girl, past the downed thief. She 
tapped on the redhead&#146;s shoulder, who immediately turned around

&#147;Something wrong?&#148; She asked.

Yoko shook her head. &#147;No. I was just&#133; really impressed by that technique 
you just did.&#148;

&#147;Are you a martial artist, too?&#148; The redhead asked. 

Yoko nodded Though she wasn&#146;t so exclusive that she announced it to 
everyone she met, it felt right to tell this girl that she was a 
fighter. Maybe some of her brother&#146;s rashness had finally rubbed off on 
her. 

The redheaded girl smiled, slapping her hands on Yoko&#146;s shoulders. 
&#147;Well, well, well. Another fight like me, huh? I thought I was the only 
girl my age who knocks around with a bit of fighter&#146;s lust. So what&#146;s 
your name, honey?&#148;

Yoko suddenly felt timid around this girl. &#147;My name? Yoko. Yoko 
Asagawa.&#148;

&#147;Jun Magami!&#148; She replied, supplying her own name. &#147;Nice to meet ya, 
girl! So tell me. What&#146;s a pretty little thing like you doing in a 
market?&#148;

&#147;Shopping,&#148; Yoko wiggled the basket at her arm. &#147;I&#146;m going to make a 
special supper tonight, for me and my grandfather.&#148;

Jun smiled once more, curling her arm around Yoko&#146;s shoulder. &#147;Home 
cooked meal, huh? That&#146;s even sweeter! I wish I could whip up something 
nice, but I can&#146;t cook worth a damn. Must be a disease in my family. 
Neither me, my Mom or my Dad can cook.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s a shame.&#148; Yoko supplied.

Jun breathed a humorous sigh. &#147;Yup. But hell, that&#146;s what we have 
take-out for! Besides, it doesn&#146;t matter much. In four days, this cute 
little number is travelling in style and profile to a full fledged 
tournament! That&#146;s when I&#146;ll kick back and enjoy great food. And, you 
know, kick a little butt.&#148;

Yoko blinked, surprised. &#147;You&#146;re competing in the God of Fighting Grand 
Championships?&#148;

&#147;You didn&#146;t think I was just a pretty face, did ya?&#148; Jun winked at Yoko, 
whipping out the tournament invite in her pocket. &#147;Beyond this hot, sexy 
exterior is the soul of a true, kick-butt fighter&#133; hold up a second. Are 
you fighting in it as well?&#148;

Yoko nodded Jun was thrown for a loop. &#147;Holy crap! So, that must mean 
you&#146;re pretty tough, huh? Fine! It&#146;s settled! You&#146;ll be cooking for 
three tonight!&#148;

&#147;Wha?!&#148; Yoko spluttered, &#147;What are you talking about, Jun?&#148;

&#147;Being that you&#146;re my newest friend and more importantly, my newest 
rival, I feel it&#146;s my duty to inspect your fighting power first hand and 
prepare myself against you for the tournament. And, y&#146;know, at the same 
time, score some free food.&#148;

Yoko blushed as red as a tomato as she realized that there was no 
getting out of this. Jun&#146;s impact-like smile confirmed that. But she 
also realized that that she wanted to get to know Jun better. It had 
only been a couple minutes since they had actually met, but Yoko liked 
her. Maybe it was her aggressive, flirty nature that made Yoko so 
charmed by Jun. Such a difference to the cold, iciness that Li Ming had&#133; 
Again, Yoko tried not to think about her. That was the past. It was time 
for the future. Yoko smiled at Jun, then grabbed her by the hand. 

&#147;If you&#146;re going to be eating any of my meals for free,&#148; Yoko jabbed 
playfully, &#147;Then you&#146;re going to help me get all the ingredients for 
them. C&#146;mon.&#148;

Jun followed along with a fake sigh and another bright grin, as Yoko 
dragged her towards some new stalls. They didn&#146;t even notice the police 
coming to cuff the dude that Jun had knocked out. It may have seemed 
strange for two people to connect so easily as that, but with Yoko, new 
friends were made everyday. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Asagawa Training Facility, Tokyo, Japan

&#147;Yoko! Hurry up! You&#146;re missing the best part!&#148;

The brunette Yoko scrambled to get up the wooden steps to her room. In 
one hand was a cup of cold spring water, in the other hand was a tape of 
her favourite Asian actor, Ryoma Taneda. Ryoma was Chinese, a great 
fighter in Jeet Kune Do that had taken to the action films scene, and 
had done a few comedy films alongside it. As it turned out, Jun was also 
a fan of him. It was surprising how much Jun and Yoko had in common They 
both liked action flicks alongside romance novels, they both liked ice 
cream, they both liked the Japanese rock band, &#145;The Valkyries&#146; and they 
both loved hanging out. And considering the fact that they went to the 
same school, it was surprising that they had never met before. Still, it 
was Summer, school had been out for almost three weeks now. Yoko walked 
along the polished floorboards of the upper living space, then came to 
her door. She slid it open with the big toe of her foot (because both of 
her hands were full) and walked inside. 

Yoko rested the tapes on the table in her room, took a sip from her 
glass of water, then turned to look at Jun. She was sitting at a 
seriously close position to the TV, her legs crossed, one of her hands 
holding a bowl of leftovers from tonight&#146;s meal, the other hand used a 
pair of chopsticks to bring rations of the bowl&#146;s contents to her mouth. 
Her green eyes remained glued to the television set, until Yoko zipped 
in. 

&#147;Yoko!&#148; Jun said eagerly, a little soy sauce on her lip. &#147;You certainly 
took your time! You&#146;re missing the good part! This is where Ryoma has to 
fight off a dozen armed guards with only his bare hands!&#148;

&#147;Your eyes are going to melt if you keep sitting so close to that 
television set.&#148; Yoko replied. 

Jun turned back to the set. &#147;Oh, stop worrying! I eat a lot of carrots. 
That&#146;ll balance it out, don&#146;t you think? Besides, this is a Ryoma Taneda 
film! And not just *any* Ryoma Taneda film, this one is &#145;Fall of the 
Screaming Dragon&#146;, Yoko! One of Ryoma&#146;s best films!&#148;

Yoko took a seat next to Jun. &#147;You think Fall of the Screaming Dragon is 
his best film?&#148;

&#147;Of course it is.&#148; Jun said blankly, still watching the screen.

&#147;Well, what about &#145;Battle Lord 3: Return to Hell?&#146;&#148; Yoko questioned. 
&#147;That was pretty cool, and the critics said it brought out the best of 
his acting skills.&#148;

Jun looked over at Yoko with a disapproving smile. &#147;Oh my god. Don&#146;t 
tell me you&#146;re one of those Battle Lord fangirls. The Battle Lord series 
is *boring*, Yoko! Too much computer generated visuals and not enough 
raw human sweat!&#148;

Yoko chuckled lightly. &#147;You sure do love your films, Jun.&#148;

&#147;Yup!&#148; Jun nodded, taking another sample of food from the bowl in her 
left hand. &#147;I&#146;m a serious film fanatic. There are only two things I like 
more. Food, and fighting. There&#146;s nothing like &#145;um.&#148;

As Jun turned back to the TV to watch the film, Yoko couldn&#146;t help but 
smile at her. She really liked Jun. There was something about her. 
Something that Yoko couldn&#146;t place, but something she could very much 
feel. Having as much in common as they did, that was just a bonus. No, 
there was something deeper about Jun that made Yoko like her. For 
instance, though she came off as abrasive and somehow rude, she wasn&#146;t 
anything of the sort. When she introduced Jun to her grandfather, Nobuo, 
Jun was perfect. Even through the meal she was polite. Maybe a little 
loud, but that just made Jun more appealing. That rough finish to 
beautiful diamond, it was more alluring than it was repelling. And it 
really hadn&#146;t escaped Yoko&#146;s notice how cute she was. Those freckles 
just made her want to melt 

Yoko smiled, moving a little closer to Jun over the floor. &#147;I&#146;m really 
glad you&#146;re here, Jun.&#148;

&#147;Hey, I enjoyed coming over.&#148; Jun replied. &#147;You gotta come over to my 
house, so I can repay the favour. But I won&#146;t cook. We&#146;ll just have to 
order a pizza. I live in Roppongi, so it&#146;s not that hard&#148;    

&#147;Pizza?&#148; Yoko blinked. &#147;Isn&#146;t that a Western dish?&#148;

Jun giggled &#147;Well, yeah. But hey, I&#146;m half American anyways. Plus, 
you&#146;ll love it. It&#146;s kinda like Okonomiyaki, accept it tastes a whole 
lot better. It&#146;s a bit more expensive, though.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure I&#146;ll love it.&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kakumei Apartment Building, Nagoya, Japan 

&#147;Hnnnnnnnnh&#133;..!&#148;

Xiangau focused his actions. His body came still, his mind became clear, 
he made his heart devoid of emotion. He spread his feet apart, tightened 
his fists, controlled his heartbeat, and turned all of his pure focus on 
the thick rock in front of him. After concentrating for a moment or two, 
there was a twinge, and Xiangau knew that was the moment of readiness. 

&#147;Hyaaah!&#148;

The silver-haired boy thrust his fist downwards, which smashed 
effortlessly through the chipping rock. His punch broke through the 
boulder till it rammed the ground, splitting it into two cracked halves. 
Xiangau took a deep breath, sighed, then withdrew his hand from the 
rocky fragments. There was a towel on the table next to him. He took it, 
used it to dab some of the sweat that had generated along his face. It 
was getting late, the sunset falling along the background was enough to 
prove it. But he didn&#146;t mind coming up to his apartment building&#146;s roof 
to practice. The rocks that were left up there were from the 
construction business that had taken place in the surrounding area. And 
with all the money that Xiangau earned by working for Mukasa in the 
Dead-End nightclub, he could afford to rent out this rooftop as his own 
from the apartment building manager. 

It was strange For a boy as young as 21, Xiangau had quite a bit of 
money on him. It was acquired by beating up people who owed money, and 
by part-timing as a bouncer at the club, but none the less, money was 
money. He could afford to live in a fancy apartment building, eat the 
best foods, enjoy the best clothes and remain relatively secluded from 
the outside world, which was what he wanted most. 

So why wasn&#146;t he happy?

Maybe it was an ever so slight twinge of guilt from earning out of other 
people&#146;s suffering. Or maybe it was because he lacked something that 
most people had. Knowledge of his past. Xiangau had no memories of his 
life before the age of twelve. All he remembered, was his times living 
on the harsh streets of Tokyo. How he had to work his way up from the 
bottom using only a fighting style that he had no memory of learning. 
For years, he thought of fighting in street fights as earning a wage 
packet. Fighting was all he knew. So when Mukasa eventually found him 
and recognized his abilities, Xiangau left with him to go to Nagoya. At 
least that way, he could make better money. 

Though it seemed like he didn&#146;t care, Xiangau did want to know about his 
past. Why was it that he could not remember where he lived or who his 
parents were? Why couldn&#146;t he  remember where he had learned this 
fighting art of his? Or who had taught it to him? These were questions 
that Xiangau longed to know the answer to And for the most part, his 
life would never be satisfactory until he knew. Which was probably why 
he was taking this tournament invite so seriously. 

Xiangau removed the towel from his forehead and walked over to a second 
table, just by the door that led into the building. On it was a glass 
and jug of water, a pair of knuckle guards, the top half of his suit (at 
present, Xiangau was wearing only trousers and shoes of his suit) and 
the tournament invitation. There was no reason why he should have even 
trusted that man, the man who handed him that tournament invite But, 
Mukasa had agreed to him taking four days off to compete in it. And, 
that man somehow knew that Xiangau was in the dark about his own past. 
For these reasons, he had to enter. If this tournament could help his 
discover his true self, then he would pursue that goal to the every end. 

Xiangau hung the towel around his neck, then looked up to the ruby-gold 
sky. His powers were his biggest mystery, and in the end, they would be 
the key to uncovering it.
