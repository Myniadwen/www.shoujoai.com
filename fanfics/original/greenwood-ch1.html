<h1>Greenwood Station</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<pre>In the seven years that I&#39;ve lived in Toronto I&#39;ve rode the subway 
trains many times and it is my main mode of transportation, aside from 
my own feet that is. I rarely go near Greenwood station; in fact I&#39;ve 
only stepped upon its platform once as far as I can remember. Every time 
I pass the station however, and read its name written in large green 
tiles across the walls, I find myself chuckling and saying to myself, 
&quot;Welcome to Greenwood. Everyone off.&quot; Now most would not understand this 
inside joke of mine unless you have lived in my shoes for a few years, 
and I would not recommend it. You see I am an avid reader of horror and 
in my day I have read nearly everything worth reading on the subject. 
Somewhere during my pursing of the libraries in my home town I 
discovered something about a place called &quot;Greenwood&quot; however in this 
case it was referring to an insane asylum in the middle of a forest 
where only the truly mad are locked away and many monster of old come to 
feast. So ever since I noticed that there was a station by this name I 
cannot help to imagine some dark asylum overhead with the insane 
screaming for freedom and creatures crawl from the vents to nibble upon 
their toes. 

I know what you are thinking, you think that I&#39;m one of those who 
belongs in that asylum for finding such a dreadful thing amusing, but 
then again I&#39;m not all there so maybe you are right, but I insist you 
let me continue with my story for you may change mind about other 
worldly things. I don&#39;t really blame you for thinking me insane for you 
see it is on my way to my psychologist office that I pass Greenwood 
station and in a way I am a little out there. However I no longer giggle 
the same way I used to about that station and now I find a smile 
crossing my usually frowning face when those tall letters appear before 
my eyes. 

For most Greenwood Subway Station is like any other. Bright overhead 
lights reflect against off-white walls and their silver-grided, black 
and white speckled, linoleum floors giving the place a welcoming 
feeling, unlike the dark halls of the New York subways that always made 
me feel as if there was something lingering the shadows like something 
out of some horror movie. The subway stations of Toronto have become a 
second home to me as I travel them so often, only avoiding them during 
the chaos of the rush hour crowds. I try my hardest to steer clear of 
those tunnels during the morning and evening rush, but sometimes it 
can&#39;t be helped and I find myself fighting for breathe between the 
crowds of people. It reminds me somewhat of my old high school, with its 
halls only wide enough for one or two people to walk side-by-side. 
Truthfully the subways are not as bad as my school was for the halls are 
much wider allowing for many people to move from one train to another 
with ease.

It was a year ago now, but I still remember that day like it was 
yesterday and the first time I set my eyes on that strangely shy girl on 
the Greenwood Station. Normally when I&#39;m riding the trains I stand at 
the doors across from those that would soon open, switching sides 
depending on which side the next platform was about to appear on. I 
usually stand to give the seats to those who need them more and standing 
near the doors allows me to watch the many passengers as they enter and 
leave the train. You see I love to people watch and it has become one of 
my favourite passed times every since escaping the nightmare of my home 
town, where everyone looked identical, to the big city, where everyone 
seemed to have something unique to share with the world. I find myself 
watching the female passengers who near me, wondering if this one could 
be the one to end my streak of loneliness. I know that may sound 
strange, but I&#39;ve pursed all the lesbian hangouts in search of my 
special someone only to be confronted with one disappointment after 
another, time and time again. 

On the day I saw her I had just about given up entirely on life itself. 
My last attempt at a relationship ended horribly only after a few weeks 
and as such I was not really searching for anyone on that day, my eyes 
drifting from one face to another without really taking in anything at 
all. I was standing in the left door, which only seems to open in the 
downtown core for the most part, as the train slowly rolled into 
Greenwood and I found myself so out of it that I didn&#39;t even smile as 
the announcer called out the stations name. The train came to a stop and 
the doors opened to allow passengers to board. It was between rush hours 
so the train was relatively empty and only a small trickle of people 
entered the train. The door I stood near was completely void of anyone 
entering or leaving, giving me a clear view of the platform before me 
and of her. 

She did not enter; instead she opted to lean against the far wall across 
from me. I have no idea how long she had been watching me before I 
finally noticed her, but the moment I did the doors began to slide shut 
again and I caught a glimpse of a small, shy, smile cross her face 
through the small glass windows upon the door. That smile effected me in 
a way that I can not explain, but I found myself moving quickly across 
the car to the doors as it start to pull out of the station, unsure if 
that smile was meant for me or not. As I peered through the window I saw 
her head follow me as the car moved along the tracks and I was almost 
certain I saw her give me a small wave, a shy little wave at waist 
height as if she did not want to call attention to herself, wanting only 
to bid me a small farewell and maybe to assure me that she indeed intend 
that smile for me. 

In those few moments that I saw her I committed her image to memory in 
hopes that one day I would meet her again. To say she was cute would be 
putting it simply, everything about her just seemed so perfect to me. 
She was about my age, in her mid twenties or maybe younger. She stood 
about five feet in height and was a tad plump, not large or fat by my 
standards, but not rail thin like so many of the girls I saw around the 
club scene. Her hair was dark brown and brushed lightly upon her 
shoulders, parted down the middle with one side tucked over her tiny 
ears, showing off her cute, round face and high cheek bones. Her dark 
eyes stared out at me, surrounded by pale skin that was speckled with a 
sparse amount of light freckles. Her attire made her seem all the 
smaller, a large black t-shirt covered her, hanging loosely over her 
shoulders and waist. Light brown kakis flowed out from beneath her 
shirt, pouring over her feet, only leaving the toes of her black docks 
poking out from under their folds. She gave me the impression of a small 
child, lost and alone. I only say this because of her eyes more then 
anything else. Even with the small smile upon her face her eyes conveyed 
a sense of sadness that I had become familiar, for I saw that same 
sadness in my own eyes every morning when I look upon a mirror, a 
loneliness that I could relate to entirely and wanted so strongly to be 
rid of.   

The next few days I could not get the image of that girl out of my mind. 
What was she doing standing there? Did she know me? Have I seen her 
somewhere before? All these questions and so many more filled my head 
and as I found myself once again riding the subways on my way passed 
Greenwood I felt myself growing excited. Would she be there again? Not 
likely, but my eyes jumped up to the platform as the announcer called 
out the station name and I quickly searched the platform for any sign of 
the girl, reminding myself that it was less then likely that she would 
be there again. She has a life and isn&#39;t going to just sit on the 
platform waiting for my return. I was happy to find myself wrong for 
there she was, standing directly across from the doors I stood at. Her 
smile broadened this time and I found myself smiling as well. We stared 
at each other, neither moving, not sure what to do next. What seemed 
like only seconds the doors closed again and the train began to move on 
again. I sat heavily upon one of the seats nearest to the door and 
dropped my head into my hands, running my fingers through my short curly 
sandy blonde hair. This was insane. There was no way this girl would be 
waiting for me. She was probably waiting for someone else who happens to 
be arriving around the same time as myself. That had to be it and there 
was no other answer. There was no other way to explain why this girl was 
standing there two times in a row. 

The next time I boarded the train I decided to enter a different car and 
left much earlier then usual. I needed to know if she was really waiting 
for me or someone else. I know how crazy this may seem, but I figured if 
she was there this time there was no other way to explain it other then 
fate. I was prepared to be disappointed and told myself over and over 
again that there was no possible way she could be there this time. I was 
an hour ahead of schedule and four cars off from my usual spot, which 
was in the middle. By the time the train arrived at Greenwood I had 
convinced myself to expect to find the platform completely empty. As the 
train slowed I frowned as she did not appear, then I saw her. Since I 
was near the front of the train it just took longer for the train to 
fully pull into the station, but there she was, directly across from the 
doors as she always was and I was almost certain that I saw a small 
glimmer in those eyes. I was so startled to find her their this time 
that I just stood there like a jaw-slacked idiot, staring in 
bewilderment at the girl before me. It took the doors closing for me to 
shake the strange sensation from my head and I cursed myself as the 
train left the station. 

Now I knew there had to be some logical explanation behind the girl&#39;s 
appearance time and time again on the platform of Greenwood station, but 
for the life of me I could not come up with an answer. The next while I 
continued to try to come up with an answer and at the same time tried to 
convince myself to finally get up the nerve to step off the train and 
approach the girl. This scared the hell out of me for some reason. I 
started to think that this was all some kind of cosmic joke and that 
when I finally spoke to the girl she was just laugh in my face and this 
notion settled heavily in my mind as the train moved along the tracks on 
its way to Greenwood station. I&#39;d completely convinced myself that this 
was one huge joke when the announcer suddenly spoke up overhead.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to inconvenience you all, but I&#39;m having troubles with this 
train so we&#39;ll be stopping at Greenwood station where everyone will have 
to exit the train and wait the next one. Sorry for the delays.&quot; 

Well this was unexpected indeed and it would appear that some force 
wanted me to get off the train at Greenwood no matter how much I refused 
to do so. I could feel my shoulder tense up and my mouth go dry at the 
idea of stepping off at that station. What would I do if she was there 
after all? What if this was all part of the joke? That was impossible, 
no one could force a subway train to stop at a specific station. Even if 
they did something to the train there was no telling where it would 
stop, or even if the train would make it to my location to pick me up. 
My mind was a muddled mess of thoughts and worries as the train slowed 
to a crawl, brakes squeaking in protest and sending a shrill sound 
through the tunnels. I figured that the brakes must have been the 
problem because I rarely ever hear them make that hellish kind of sound. 
The doors opened before me and several passengers departed, grumbling as 
they did. 

As the crowd dispersed, finding their place along the walls, I was 
surprised to find her nowhere in sight. Maybe it wasn&#39;t fate after all 
and I was just making too much out of a coincidence. Letting out a sigh 
of relief and disappointment I stepped out of the car and looked around 
for a place to stand. That was when I saw her. She was sitting upon a 
bench only a few feet away, with a book in hand. I felt myself swallow 
hard as her eyes settled upon me and I glanced around to see if she was 
indeed with someone else. There were maybe thirty people on the 
platform, but not one took notice of the girl and I felt myself growing 
nervous under her gazing, having to stare at the ground and my ratty 
sneakers. I was so convinced that I would never talk to her that I 
didn&#39;t bother to dress very nicely. My jeans were faded and covered in 
some kind of grease stain that I don&#39;t recall getting before. My white 
t-shirt was wrinkled from sleeping in it the other night and my hair was 
a complete disaster, never doing anything I want it too. 

I ran my long fingers through my hair for a moment and fixed my glasses 
upon my nose as I spun in circles a few times, trying to appear as if I 
was in search of a place to stand. I was so concerned with the girl that 
I did not notice that the train has already left and a new one quickly 
took its place. I became aware of the new arrival as people stepped away 
from the wall and approached the yellow rubber tiles that marked the 
safety zone, one step too close and someone could be clipped by the 
incoming train and that would be the end of it for them. I moved against 
the wall, not wanting to be crushed by the crowd of impatient 
passengers. I&#39;ve found that even a delay of a few minutes can cause some 
people to get rather irate and I would rather not be near someone who 
might suddenly rail up and hit someone for no reason. This has not 
happened often, but I have had a backpack hit me across the head as 
someone sung it around in their haste to enter the car and I don&#39;t wish 
to experience that again. 

Against the wall I could see the girl, still sitting at the bench with 
her book in hand. She was no longer paying attention to me as her eyes 
moved over the words before her. I pulled a wristwatch out of my pocket; 
I don&#39;t like the feel of them on my wrist so keep them in my pockets, 
and glanced upon its face to see I was about forty-five minutes ahead of 
schedule so decided it might be better to wait for the next train then 
try to fight with this mob for a spot on the train. The crowd quickly 
dissipated and before long I found myself standing alone on the 
Greenwood platform, alone aside from the mysterious girl who was once 
again looking up from her book. Unsure what to do I slid along the wall 
towards the girl and looked down at the seat beside her. 

&quot;M... Mind if I sit here?&quot; I slightly stammered, pointing at the spot 
beside her. 

She shook her head and smiled, &quot;Go ahead.&quot; 

I sat down and for the first time I noticed just how wobbly my legs 
were. I tried to think of something to say. Everything that came to mind 
sounded lame and so much like a bad pick up line it was unreal. What do 
you say to a girl that keeps appearing at the same station over and over 
again? Saying it is fate that me met sounded so stupid, but I that was 
what I was feeling that very moment. Finally a question came to mind 
that didn&#39;t sound completely stupid. 

&quot;Are you waiting for someone?&quot; I finally asked, proud of myself for not 
sounding like a complete fool, but the strange look upon her face made 
me feel that this was the wrong question to ask after all. 

The girl stared at me in confusion, &quot;I...&quot; She started to speak, then 
stopped herself and nibbled on her lip in a cute way that made me smile. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I lowered my head in shame, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to intrude, I 
just noticed you sitting here and thought you must be waiting for 
someone.&quot; 

She tilted her head as if she was studying me, &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; She stated 
miserably and turned her head to the floor, her hand holding the book 
tightly between her hands, &quot;I can&#39;t leave here.&quot; 

Now it was my turn to be confused, &quot;You can&#39;t leave?&quot; 

Her hand came to her mouth as she realized something that I hadn&#39;t, &quot;You 
don&#39;t know, do you?&quot; She said in shock and suddenly got to her feet, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I thought...&quot; 

I stood as well, watching her carefully. She seemed nervous all of a 
sudden, almost as if she had did something horribly wrong, &quot;You thought 
what? Were you waiting for me?&quot; I blurted out unintentionally. 

She froze in place at those word and stared at me with fear in her eyes, 
&quot;I really thought...&quot; again her eyes dropped to the ground. 

Suddenly I felt very anxious to know what it was that was on this girl&#39;s 
mind, &quot;You were waiting for me then, but why?&quot; 

She quickly shook her head and turned to flee, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be here.&quot; 

&quot;Wait!&quot; I called out and grabbed her arm, stopping her flight, &quot;Is this 
some kind of prank or something? Tell me why you were waiting for me 
here?&quot; I waved my hand around the station frantically, &quot;What do you want 
with me?&quot; 

The girl&#39;s arms grew limp as she stood before me, her head down so her 
hair fell before her eyes, &quot;When I saw you and you looked back at me I 
thought you knew, that you were like me.&quot; 

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I insisted firmly, &quot;I have no clue what 
you are going on about.&quot; 

She looked up at me, &quot;Where were you heading?&quot; She suddenly asked. 

I let go of her arm as I staggered back at this question, &quot;I... I...&quot; 
Suddenly remembering my appointment I pulled out my watch to see the 
hour was growing close, &quot;Shit! I&#39;m going to be late.&quot; I glanced around 
in search for the nearest clock to confirm that my watch was indeed 
telling the correct time. The digital display scrolled the latest news 
overhead along with the current time and to my surprise my watch was 
three hours behind, &quot;What the hell? It can&#39;t be afternoon already!&quot; I 
shook my watch frantically in hopes to hear the slightest ticking, &quot;My 
doctor is going to kill me.&quot;

She set her hand upon mine and shook her head. There was a look of 
sympathy in those big brown eyes, &quot;He will not mind...&quot; She said with a 
deep sigh and then pulled a scrap of paper from her back pocket and 
handed it to me, &quot;Here, this is why I&#39;ve been waiting for you.&quot; 

My hands trembled as I took the paper from her hand to discover that it 
was a torn page of a newspaper folded several times into a small square. 
As I unfolded the paper I found my hear racing out of control. Upon the 
page was a small black and white picture of me, one from my photo ID, 
below it the words screamed out at me and I felt the strength from my 
legs give out and I dropped to the ground. 

&quot;Woman, 28, pushed before train.&quot;

I could not believe what I was seeing. I was alive and there was no way 
this could be true. 

The girl knelt next to me, &quot;I found that in the newspaper a week ago and 
was hoping that we&#39;d run into each other.&quot; She said in a quiet voice, 
&quot;When I saw you on the train I thought for sure you had awaken, that you 
knew you were dead and that was why you rode the trains. I preyed 
everyday that you would step off that train.&quot; 

I glanced up at the girl to see tears in her eyes, &quot;H... how long have 
you been here?&quot; I shakily asked. 

&quot;Ten years....&quot; She said with a sigh, &quot;I was attacked by a group of kids 
and one of them stabbed me. I died in the corner over there.&quot; She 
pointed over my shoulder and for the first time I saw a red stain upon 
the wall and floor.

I stared down at the clipping before me. It stated that during the rush 
hour I was shoved too close to the tracks and as I tried to catch my 
balance the train hit me. I died instantly and I bet if I ventured to 
that station I would find a pool of my blood, people walking passed it 
as if there was nothing there. I laughed. To think it would be that 
simple and that I would be so unaware that I would continue trying to 
get to my doctor&#39;s time and time again. I glanced up at the girl, &quot;You 
mind if I join you? I&#39;m tired of being alone.&quot; I said weakly. 

The girl smiled, &quot;You can stay as long as you want.&quot; 

So that is my story and we have been haunting Greenwood station together 
for over a year now and it is even better then anything I expected. I 
never want to be without her and I truly hope she feels the same. To 
whoever reads this, the next time you are down at Greenwood Station and 
see something moving inexpertly don&#39;t be afraid, it is just us kids 
having a good time. Come join us when your time comes.

The end
