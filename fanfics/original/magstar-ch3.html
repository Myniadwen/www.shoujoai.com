<h1>Magic Star Warriors: The Dark Force Era (part 3 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/magstar-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>3rd Street, early evening

Two figures walk slowly down the quiet street of third. Two characters 
that at day, live by the names of Yai Kitana and Alana Hiramu at day, 
but at night, walk under the guise of Lovestar and Sunstar, eternal 
warriors of justice. Unknown to the people who walk amongst them, 
their destines lie in the hands of these crusaders of truth.

As they walked down the road, Yai turns to face Alana. Just two hours 
ago, she had been locked in combat with the other world general, 
Tanzanite. Then Alana arrived and helped her out. She had transformed 
into the magic star soldier, Sunstar and aided her with the attack, 
the shining sunset beam. Although they didn&#146;t manage to kill this man, 
they did injure him severely. After that, they managed to talk and 
found out each other&#146;s identities. This grand mission seemed to be a 
daunting task for Yai, but she felt as though she could handle it. But 
Alana however&#133;she seemed so distant, so full of pain and anguish.  She 
wanted to know why, what was so painful about it. She only uttered a 
few words in response, and it dawned on her. &#145;The exhilaration of 
battle is nothing compared to the responsibilities that we have to 
struggle with&#146;. 

And Alana knew first hand how true her statement was. She explained it 
all. The training, the frequency of the attacks, the horrors seen 
while in battle with them and the separation from close friends to 
protect them. She made her fate seem so bleak. That she had 
experienced no true happiness since her first transformation. It 
explained her sudden change of personality over the past few months. 
How could her best friend in the world keep something this huge from 
her?

&#147; I had no idea you were a magic star soldier you know.&#148;

Alana gently smiled. She could tell the pain she has been through had 
affected Yai. 

&#147;It&#146;s not really something you go around announcing is it?&#148;

Yai smiled back.

&#147;Yeah. I guess your right. So how long have you had to deal with this? 
I mean its such an enormous duty to take on, even if it&#146;s by a super 
brain like you are.&#148;

&#147;Why thank you! But the truth is, I have found it very hard to deal 
with. The dangers I have to face and the work I have to do to keep my 
skills at their peak. I&#146;d say I&#146;ve been doing this for around 3 to 4 
months. That&#146;s why I&#146;ve been so distant. I just didn&#146;t want to drag 
the people I care about into any unnecessary danger.&#148;

&#147; But you should have told me. I&#146;m your best friend aren&#146;t I? How do 
you think it makes me feel knowing that all this time you&#146;ve been 
going through something this deep while I&#146;ve been sitting here 
completely oblivious to it?&#148;

Alana looked confused.

&#147;Why?&#148;  

&#147;What do you mean why? I know you kept this from me to protect me, but 
you have had to isolate yourself from all your friends only to suffer 
in silence. I&#146;ve only been one of the magic star soldiers for two days 
and I&#146;ve fought someone on both of them. And you&#146;ve had to deal with 
that for the past 4 months?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not like there are attacks everyday you know. And besides who 
cares about that now? We are both magic star soldiers and it&#146;s a 
mission we can now share.&#148;

&#147;Yeah. It&#146;s just...I care about you and I don&#146;t want to see you in 
pain.&#148;

Alana smiled again. Yai was a very caring friend. Even when they were 
kids, if Alana was in any kind of trouble, Yai wouldn&#146;t stop until she 
found out the root of the problem and did something about it. Maybe 
she did worry a bit too much but she compensated for this with true 
compassion. As the two reached the end of the street, Yai pointed out 
the house of which a third Magic Starsoldier resided. Keiya.  

Keiya herself was lying on her sky white couch racking her brain with 
the same problem she had been thinking about all day. The mission 
alone was hard enough to deal with, now she had to cope with this 
thing about Yai. 

&#147;It just doesn&#146;t make any sense.&#148; She thought to herself.

&#147;Why should I care if Yai has a boyfriend of not? Why should it matter 
to me? I&#146;ve only known her for a couple of days, what concern is it of 
mine? But even if it makes no sense, I can&#146;t deny how I feel about her 
anymore. Ever since that time on 7th street where we almost kissed, 
she has been driving me crazy. I can&#146;t stop thinking about her. 
There&#146;s just something about her. She&#146;s special. Like the time I was 
battling Kazuhito at Keneda. How was Yai able to see past my cloaking 
powers and identify who I was? Oh but that didn&#146;t mean anything. 
Whether her powers were in activation or not, she was still a magic 
starsoldier. And we almost kissed. We didn&#146;t actually kiss. Maybe what 
I&#146;m feeling now is just a way of getting over Hikaru; maybe I&#146;m just&#133; 
&#147;

Before she could continue, Keiya&#146;s thoughts were disturbed by a knock 
on her door. She really wasn&#146;t in the mood for this, considering that 
she was half asleep and whichever part of her was awake was trying to 
figure out what this thing with Yai meant, but at least it wasn&#146;t a 
demon attack. Keiya arose from her couch gradually and headed toward 
the door. As she opened the door she was very surprised to find none 
other than&#133;

&#147;Yai&#133;? What are you doing here?&#148;  Keiya said shocked.

&#147;That&#146;s a fine welcome!&#148; 

&#147;Oh sorry, it&#146;s just I have a lot on my mind right now and&#133;who&#146;s your 
friend?&#148;

&#147;Oh this? This is&#133;&#148;

&#147;Alana. Alana Hiramu. And it&#146;s a pleasure to meet you Keiya.&#148;

&#147;Sure. Nice to meet you to.&#148;

&#147;Anyway Keiya, we really need to talk. Can I come inside for a moment 
please?&#148; 

Keiya&#146;s face assumed a reluctant smile, but none the less, she decided 
to let Yai and her friend in.

&#147;Well sure I guess. Just follow me.&#148; In the back of Keiya&#146;s mind, a 
voice kept calling her out, taunting by telling her sweet thoughts, 
radical ones but alluring nonetheless&#133;

&#147;You&#146;re letting her in&#133;&#148;

&#147;So?&#148;

&#147;Doesn&#146;t this prove you care about her more than you&#146;re letting on?&#148;

&#147;Shut up! Yai&#146;s just a girl I met a couple of days ago!&#148;

&#147;Do you care about that?&#148;

&#147;Well&#133; I &#133;&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t do you? Just admit you like her&#133; that you care about her&#133; 
much more then you&#146;re letting on.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t feel that way about her!&#148;        

&#147;Why are you lying?&#148;

&#147;I am not lying!&#148;

&#147;If that&#146;s true then why did you feel so badly when Yai mentioned her 
boyfriend&#133;?&#148;

&#147;I&#133; I just&#133; I didn&#146;t &#133;&#148;

&#147;You see? You&#146;re good at lying to others but not to yourself eh?&#148;

&#147;Shut up!&#148;

&#147;Jealousy doesn&#146;t suit you Keiya Shindo&#133;&#148;

&#147;Shut up!!!&#148;

Yai looked at Keiya when she mumbled &#145;shut up&#146; under her breath. She 
seemed troubled somehow&#133;

&#147;You alright Keiya?&#148;

Keiya jerked up as she her heard her name. 

&#147;Huh, what? Oh no, I&#133; I&#146;m fine. So what do you want to talk about?&#148;

**********

Meanwhile in a place far from that scene, the wounded and angry 
Tanzanite stalks up and down the long, narrow hallway of the Negative 
dimension. Surrounded by Ivory statues of demons and gods, the dark 
general was becoming more and more angry. At himself and at the magic 
starsoldiers. 

&#147;How could I let myself get so injured by one bolt of energy? Asumasa 
will not like this if she finds out.&#148;

As Tanzanite walked through the corridor, streaks of blue lightning 
past through it also. Wind created by the lightning whipped at the 
dust-covered floor of marble and the lightning gathered to form the 
figure of a woman. And to Tanzanite&#146;s dismay it was none other than 
the crimson princess herself, Garnet. Tanzanite turned round to meet 
the woman&#146;s mockingly contented laugh. Garnet herself was a stunningly 
beautiful woman. Her face framed perfectly by the long mane of silky 
ruby red hair enveloping it, with two thick locks cascading down the 
side of her face. Her sneaky jet black eyes were shining as though 
they were forged into dark crystal by the greatest darkness in the 
universe. Her body, beaming with grace and charm looked as if the gods 
themselves sculpted its lush curves. She wore a long, ruby satin dress 
tight fitting enough to make even the strongest of men faint.  It was 
accompanied by two sliver, diamond encrusted bracelets on each of her 
wrists and a pair of crimson, high heel shoes.

Tanzanite was more than startled by her appearance in the Negative 
Dimension. Mainly because of the intense rivalry between them. They 
had been enemies from the beginning, even though they served under 
Queen Asumasa, ever since their appointment into her court, and as her 
lords of darkness. They had competed for years, whether it meant a 
battle on the front line with the enemy, or obtaining more energy from 
humans.   It had been bitter competition, no quarter given and none 
asked, but the rivalry allowed them to pull of some very fine work. 
And all through this, Tanzanite had learned that when Garnet had that 
smile, that evil smile, it meant she had an ace up her sleeve. 

&#147;Well, well, well. Garnet. I haven&#146;t seen you in a while. What brings 
you to the negative dimension? Does her highness have new orders?&#148;

Garnet slowly walked toward Tanzanite and until they were face to 
face. All though he gave no outward sign, the glare Garnet was giving 
him, the fire in her eyes, and her disgustingly evil smile, made him 
nervous. Very nervous. Slowly she closed her eyes and began to 
chuckle.

&#147;You know Tanzanite. When her majesty the Queen first gave you the 
task of obtaining all of the talismans, for the first time ever I 
doubted her judgment. I couldn&#146;t understand how a weakling like you 
could be put in charge of our destiny. Our future. But now in know 
why. She felt sorry for you!&#148;

&#147;What!?&#148; 

&#147;You heard me. She felt sorry for you. Look at you. Damaged so badly 
by a single attack? Struggling to defeat a weak enemy? Getting only 
one talisman in the space of 4 months? Face it. You&#146;re a loser. An 
absolute failure, and her highness is sick of your bungling so has 
issued a decree; if you don&#146;t obtain all of the talismans soon, 
consider yourself a dead man&#133;&#148;

Tanzanite couldn&#146;t believe what he was hearing. Was her highness so 
upset she would terminate him? 

&#147;How&#133;dare you!! You lying, deceitful little&#133;&#148;

&#147;Fool. Face facts. Your incompetence and failure is dangerous us and 
our cause. If you can&#146;t shape up, you&#146;re dead. From now on I&#146;m going 
to be on you like a shadow&#133;I&#146;m going to monitor your every move and as 
soon as you slip up&#133;Bamm!!! I&#146;ll be there to take your place as 
controller of this operation&#133;Bwa, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!!!&#148;

With that, Garnet transformed into lightning and teleported out of the 
room, leaving only the echo of her laughter as a reminder of her 
little visit. With a gasp Tanzanite fell to his knees and clutched at 
his injured shoulder. He knew things weren&#146;t looking good for him and 
with an unconfirmed three Magic Starsoldiers on the loose; he realized 
unless he came up with a plan, his days were numbered.

*********

&#147;Get out of town! You mean to tell me that you&#146;re a Magic Starsoldier 
too?&#148;

&#147;Yes Keiya it&#146;s true. I am a magic starsoldier. &#145;Sunstar&#146;.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s amazing. As soon as I transfer to Keneda, I find Yai, who turns 
out to be Lovestar, and then, three days later, I find you Alana, and 
you turn out to be Sunstar! This is perfect! Individually we are 
strong but together we could be an unstoppable force! That is&#133;if we&#146;re 
all willing to work together that is&#133;&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m in. I don&#146;t want to face this alone if I don&#146;t need to. What 
about you Alana?&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t think of anything that would make me happier than to work 
side by side with you both.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s great Alana!&#148; Yai beamed. &#147;Now we&#146;ll be more powerful than 
ever! And I think we may need it&#133;&#148;

&#147;What do you mean Yai? Did this &#145;Tanzanite&#146; guy you and Alana fought 
earlier tell you anything?&#148;

&#147;Yes. Just before Alana arrived, and before I battled him, he said 
something about four Talismans and his Queen, Asumasa I think. He said 
something about an&#133;event&#133;Lunatic&#133;Andromeda or something.  Sounds 
important to me. He also told me he was assigned the duty to kill us.&#148;

&#147;Well, from what you&#146;ve told me, he doesn&#146;t seem to be that strong.&#148;

&#147;That doesn&#146;t matter. If he is willing to kill us as a set mission, it 
probably means his Queen, the leader, wants us out of the picture 
before we can interfere with this event.&#148; Alana supplied. 

&#147;You think that this may give cause for concern?&#148; Keiya asked. 

&#147;Possibly. If he attacked us directly, he was either stepping up his 
attack, which means he&#146;s, desperate and this would in turn mean that 
this event might begin soon, or it&#146;s possible that there&#146;s a talisman 
in the school.&#148;

Yai became worried. &#147;Does this mean that Keneda is in danger?&#148;

&#147;I think so Yai. Which is why it&#146;s a good thing all three of us go to 
Keneda. Keiya, did you hear anything from any demons?&#148;

&#147;&#133;No&#133;but that Lunatic Andromeda&#133;I think I&#146;ve heard of it somewhere. I 
think I&#146;m going to research it.&#148;

&#147;Research it? You mean you possess some of the sacred books of Tarn&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Well, Yes. My master passed them on to me as he passed away. 
Hopefully, they&#146;ll have some information on this Lunatic Andromeda 
thing and these Talismans.&#148;

&#147;Oh I&#146;d love to look at them! That is if you don&#146;t mind Keiya&#133;I mean 
if you don&#146;t mind&#133;&#148;

&#147;Sure. There in my basement so just follow me.&#148;

&#147;Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait just a minute. What on earth are the books of 
Tarn?&#148;

&#147; We shall tell you that in a minute. Lets go!&#148;

The newly formed team of Yai Kitana, Keiya Shindo and Alana Hiramu 
entered the basement to read these sacred books, which possessed 
information on the history of the planet, the magic star warriors 
throughout time, and the past of the Demon monsters. However even 
after 2 or 3 of search no information on the talismans or the Lunatic 
Andromeda was found by any of them. Alana and Keiya agreed to resume 
the search tomorrow and begin Yai&#146;s Training in a week or so.

Two weeks later

&#147;Oof!!&#148;

&#147;Get up Yai, it isn&#146;t that bad.&#148;

Yai again found herself ground into the floor while sparring with 
Alana. This had been her third day of training and slowly, very 
slowly, she was getting better. However she still had a way to go to 
reach Alana or Keiya&#146;s level. Whether it was studying or training, 
Alana was a demon when it came to work. She&#146;d expect 100% on the 
training ground with rests about as frequent as blue moons. It&#146;s not 
that this wasn&#146;t doing any good for Yai but still&#133;

Slowly Yai stood, picking blades of grass out of her hair and removing 
twigs from her jeans. A dense forest out in a distant patch of land 
surrounded the two of them. It was quite large, but not big enough to 
attract many people if any. Alana had been ranting on for days about 
it being perfect but now Yai was far from sure. 

&#147;Alana&#133;(huff)&#133;tell me again (huff) why we are training&#133;here?&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s the problem now?&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s the problem? I&#146;m covered in grass!&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t see anything.&#148;

&#147;Couldn&#146;t we have gone to a gym or a dojo or something&#133;?&#148;

&#147;I think a little thing called super-natural abilities may attract a 
little attention. Ha, ha, ha!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m serious! I don&#146;t know how many more times I can eat dirt! God, 
I&#146;m starting to appreciate the study sessions&#133;&#148;

&#147;Ok, Ok. We&#146;ll train a little longer and then we can go home, how&#146;s 
that? &#148; 

Yai mused over that.  &#147;Well&#133; alright.&#148;

&#147;Now. Come at me.&#148;

Yai adopted one of the sixteen fighting stances that Alana had taught 
her and began to charge at her. As the distance between the two 
decreased, Alana adjusted her position to a more defensive status. As 
Yai reached Alana&#146;s proximity of attack, she lunged her fist towards 
at Alana&#146;s stomach. Alana sidestepped the attack, moving to the right. 
Yai then made a shallow turning that direction and aimed a kick at 
Alana&#146;s head. This time the blonde genius wasn&#146;t fast enough to dodge 
it, but successfully blocked it as Yai&#146;s leg was within inches of her 
temple. Retracting her leg she leapt back defensively. She dropped to 
her feet and tried to make a sweep at Alana, who jumped into the air 
to avoid the attack. She landed and back flipped several meters away 
from Yai. Yai then stood and paused for a moment. After focusing her 
energy for a couple of seconds, she charged once again, head first at 
Alana. As soon as the chestnut haired girl came close enough to 
attack, she unleashed a flurry of punches, kicks and elbow strikes in 
an attempt to penetrate Alana&#146;s rock hard defenses. The claps and waps 
from each blocked blow sent shockwaves through the forest, disturbing 
nearby birds forcing them to flee the forest. The fury of the assault 
was short-lived however. Yai soon began to tire out as each blow began 
to slow down and lose power. As Alana dodged the last of Yai&#146;s blows, 
she used the momentum to strike. She managed to smash her knee into 
Yai&#146;s stomach, and raised her hand into the air in the &#145;Crab claw&#146; 
condition. Alana began to draw in energy to form a swirling vortex of 
power around her palm. In a move, which can only be described as 
poetry in motion, the blonde genius thrust her energy charged palm 
into the small of Yai&#146;s back. Yai let out a yelp of pain as shockwaves 
passed through her body and ruptured her balance.  Yai toppled to the 
ground coughing slightly. Alana then moved over to the bruised girl 
and crossed her arms as she watched her. 

&#147;(Cough) what the hell&#133; (Cough) was that&#133;!?&#148;

&#147;I little trick I invented called the Cannon palm. It causes 
disruptions in the vision and balance of an enemy on impact. However 
the attack only works when the enemy is burnt out. Like you.&#148;

&#147;Well you didn&#146;t&#133;(cough) teach me that&#133;&#148;

&#147;It never hurts to have a technique unique to yourself.&#148;

&#147;Well&#133;once again I&#146;m eating dirt. 	Can we go home now?&#148;

&#147;I suppose you did take pretty nasty blow&#133;lets go.&#148;

Yai let out a sigh of relief as Alana extended her hand to help her 
up.  Slowly she stood, her body still numb and sore, but at least she 
was able to walk. Alana told Yai from the beginning that this would be 
intense, but she still felt a little weird about her sweet, little 
best friend working her this hard. As they walked towards the exit of 
the forest clearing, Alana turned to look at Yai. She seemed impatient 
somehow, like she needed to get home quickly for something. 

&#147;Yai, what is it that you want to get home so badly for?&#148;

&#147;Well I simply want to rest. And&#133; to get some money off my dad to buy 
something to wear for the dance this Friday.&#148;

&#147;So that&#146;s it. The school dance. I should have known it shouldn&#146;t I?&#148;

&#147;You mean your not going Alana?&#148;

&#147;Nah, I want to research more on the books of Tarn that Keiya lent to 
me. That reminds me is Keiya going?&#148;

&#147;Yep. She&#146;s going with one of the fifty boys that have asked her out 
already.&#148;

&#147;And that doesn&#146;t bother you?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t mind. I cant resent the fact that tons of guys from our 
school find Keiya more attractive than they do me&#133;well at least not 
much.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s not what I meant.&#148;

&#147;Then what are you talking about?&#148;

&#147;&#133;You don&#146;t have a clue do you?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;&#133;Forget it.&#148;

The two women the walked out through the tree path and, out of the 
clearing. Yai still didn&#146;t know what Alana meant, at least she thought 
she didn&#146;t, but she dismissed it and left it alone.


Friday night, Keneda high school

The night was brimming with the feeling of passion. The intensity of 
the soft dance music emanating from Keneda high school blazed out into 
the night sky. It was a beacon to all couples. A time for two people 
to share their love.

But also to have a good time to. Outside the polished pine doors of 
the auditorium, dozens of couples were either talking to each other or 
making out, and on the inside more and more people were dancing. 
Slowly two characters emerged from a red car parked out in front. Yai 
and her boyfriend Akira were those ones. Arm in arm, the two stepped 
towards the doors of the auditorium, greeting those who they knew on 
their way there. As they entered, Yai looked over the place. It seemed 
completely different from this morning. It was alive with youth and 
compromise.  Decorated with multi-colored streamers and balloons, 
banners and flashing lights. The night burned with electricity.  

Before Akira got the chance to ask Yai to dance, she spotted Hisaka 
and Yumi and decided to talk to them. As you can imagine they were 
with two guys dancing.  As she walked over to where they were, she 
greeted them. 

&#147;Hisaka, Yumi!&#148;

&#147;Yai Hello!&#148;   &#147;Hiya Yai! Over here!&#148;

Yai walked over to her two good friends Hisaka and Yumi and took an 
amused, sly look at the two men standing behind them. 

&#147;Hi guys. Hey, since when have you been going out with The Kobayashi 
brothers?&#148;

&#147;A couple of days ago. Gosh Tetsura is just so cute!&#148; Hisaka squeezed 
the cheek of her boyfriend and gave him a light peck on the forehead. 

&#147;Yeah, so is Shinichi!&#148; Yumi (who was arm in arm with Shinichi) leaned 
in affectionately onto the side of her boyfriends arm.

&#147; (In unison) Yeah we&#146;re just so darn cute!&#148;

All Yai could do was just sweat drop and laugh nervously. What else 
should she have expected from Tetsura and Shinichi Kobayashi? At that 
second her brain kicked into gear as she scanned the auditorium 
profusely. 

&#147;Something wrong Yai?&#148; Yumi asked.

&#147;I was just looking for Keiya. Is she here? I can&#146;t find her.&#148;

&#147;Oh don&#146;t look so disappointed I&#146;m sure she&#146;s&#133;Hey look there she is. 
With Shingo&#133;!&#148;

&#147;Keiya.&#148;

As Yai turned around she was amazed to see Keiya. She was walking 
through the door enveloped in light. She looked different somehow. She 
was wearing her soft lilac hair up, which gave her a unique, more 
mature and elegant image. Her dress, a light/feint diamond, seemed to 
shine an eye piercingly beautiful look in the light. It was tight and 
firm, and highlighted her voluptuous, almost statuesque body. Tonight 
everything about Keiya seemed perfect. Everything from her crystal 
white, high heel shoes to her cream white long arm gloves. She was 
perfect. Like a goddess. Perfect. 

Hisaka was looking at Keiya also when Yumi nudged at her, smiling 
amusedly.  Hisaka looked at her with a bemused look about her sudden 
giggle fit. Yumi just laughed and pointed in Yai&#146;s direction, as Yai 
herself was staring at Keiya as if she were mesmerized. Hisaka 
snickered at Yai and walked over to her. She laid a hand on the 
chestnut haired girl&#146;s shoulder and Yai briefly turned around to look 
at her.

&#147;Hey girl why don&#146;t you take a picture, it&#146;ll last longer!&#148; Hisaka 
laughed.  

Yai looked confused for a moment, but then blushed a deep crimson when 
she realized Hisaka saw her staring at Keiya. Yumi also walked over 
and had a quick laugh.

&#147;Yeah, you might also think about picking your jaw up off the floor 
too Yai!&#148;

&#147;Hey I&#133;I just thought that&#133;that she looked good with&#133; her hair up like 
that, that&#146;s all.&#148; Yai argued. 

In the doorway, arm in arm with Shingo a guy that had asked her out 
recently, she caught Yai in the corner of her eye. She could feel her 
heart beating faster and faster, but she had been going over this for 
so long. This &#145;Yai&#146; thing had to end. The purple haired starlet turned 
away from her gaze and walked over to the refreshment table. Yai felt 
an uneasiness descend on her when Keiya didn&#146;t come over, so she 
grabbed Akira who was busy talking to the Kobayashi brothers and went 
over there herself. 

&#147;Keiya&#133;are you ok?&#148; Shingo asked.

&#147;I&#146;m fine. I really appreciate you taking me to this dance.&#148; 

&#147;Hey, I&#146;m just glad you picked me out of the boys brigade constantly 
following you! You&#146;re special to me&#133;I care about you.&#148;

Just as soon as he cupped Keiya&#146;s cheek in his hands he quickly backed 
off as Yai approached them. Yai moved towards the two and took a 
second to observe them. Keiya seemed to be acting normally, but she 
was a little bit more distant than usual. It felt to her, like Keiya 
was in a way&#133; upset. She could see it in her eyes. Although her body 
language and facial expression betrayed nothing to her, those usually 
bright, crystal blue eyes&#133; hid something&#133; Shingo on the other hand 
seemed to be on cloud nine. I suppose it&#146;s to be expected, he did just 
get the chance to go out with probably the most attractive girl in 
Keneda.

&#147;Keiya. I saw you from over there. You look great.&#148; Yai smiled at the 
Lilac haired girl, not noticing the faint blush that had just crept 
across her own face.

&#147;Thanks Yai. You look nice to.&#148; Keiya said that half-heartedly, and 
put out a weak smile. 

&#147;That&#146;s it. Go! Don&#146;t do this to yourself. Focus, deal, and move on.&#148;

&#147;Well I think I better&#133;&#148; Just before she could continue, she was cut 
off by Yai&#146;s habitual eagerness. 

&#147;Oh before I forget, this is my boyfriend Akira. Akira meet Keiya, a 
close friend of mine.&#148;

&#147;Close?&#148; Keiya thought confusedly. 

&#147;Hi. Yai&#146;s told me so much about you.&#148; Akira said kindly, and put out 
his hand to shake. Yai sighed at his informal ness, it was so like him 
but still&#133;

&#147;A great pleasure.&#148; Keiya looked over to him, while doing so her 
charming and elegant demeanor changed abruptly, which strangely went 
unnoticed by Yai and Shingo, but Akira was not so oblivious to her 
actions.

Keiya grasped his hand quickly and the young man found his hand in a 
surprisingly powerful grip. He was a little startled, and looked up to 
her Keiya&#146;s face. It had lost its previous look of quiet pain and had 
changed considerably. It was rigid and threatening, and it didn&#146;t suit 
her features at all. But in her eyes&#133;they burned with a passion&#133;with 
the flame of a challenge&#133;

Before he read too much into it, Akira let go and stepped back. 
Keiya&#146;s eyes still challenging, softened. Then Yai spoke.

&#147;So Keiya are you going to&#133;&#148;

&#147;Look Yai I&#146;m sorry but Shingo and I&#133;we need to go.&#148;

Keiya then grabbed Shingo&#146;s wrist and walked over to the other side of 
the Auditorium.  While she did, Yai looked back and forth between 
them. Her mind ran wild when she realized that Keiya and Shingo maybe 
more than just friends&#133;

Later that night, all of the couples were dancing closely to a slow 
song, including Hisaka and Tetsura, Yumi and Shinichi, Keiya and 
Shingo and Yai and Akira. But Yai just couldn&#146;t keep her eyes off of 
Keiya and Shingo. They were just so close. Maybe a little too close.

&#147;Since when did Keiya let a guy get so close to her?&#148; Yai thought to 
herself. &#147;Why the hell has she been avoiding me all night?&#148;

Yai&#146;s eyes narrowed as she watched Shingo move in close to Keiya. Too 
close. He mumbled something into her ear, and then the two moved into 
a slow, passionate kiss. Yai felt herself become distraught, as she 
took in this sight. Startled and shocked she asked herself&#133; has Keiya 
fallen for Shingo?
