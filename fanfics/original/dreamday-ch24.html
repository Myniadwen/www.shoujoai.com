<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Kris woke up and stretched with a smile on her face, the other night&#39;s 
adventures fresh in her mind. Jenn leaned over and looked down at the 
girl. Kris smiled, reached out to touch Jennifer&#39;s face then leaned 
forward and kissed her softly on the lips. 

Jenn seemed surprised by this and quickly pulled back. Kris was confused 
and sat up not understanding what just happened. She blinked several 
times and then noticed that she wasn&#39;t in Jenn&#39;s room, nor was she in 
her apartment. Sitting at the end of the bed was Sarah, no longer 
dressed in the gown she wore to the dance, instead in a simple housecoat 
over a long nightgown.
In her hand she held a damp cloth. Her other hand was to her lips. 

Kris looked around and started to remember what happened. The dance. The 
fight. She placed her hands over her face. She just mistook Sarah for 
Jennifer. How stupid could she be? Kris went to get up then noticed that 
she was only in her underwear. She grabbed the blankets and covered 
herself up. &quot;I... Umm...&quot; 

Sarah took a moment to recover before speaking, &quot;I put your clothes in 
the laundry machine. They were covered in mud, so...&quot; She blushed. 

Kris blushed a deeper red, pulling the blankets tighter around her body. 
She suddenly wished she wore a bra more often, &quot;Thank you and I&#39;m 
sorry... I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; She couldn&#39;t finish her sentence. 

Sarah got up trying hard not to letting her eyes fall on Kris, &quot;It was 
an accident,&quot; She paced in place then headed for the door, &quot;Do you want 
something to drink? I think there&#39;s still something left in the fridge 
that my brother hasn&#39;t finished off yet.&quot; 

Kris shook her head, &quot;That&#39;s alright, I think I drank too much already.&quot; 
She tentatively touched her face and winced in pain. 

Sarah dropped down beside the wounded girl and pressed the cloth against 
Kris&#39;s face, &quot;Don&#39;t do that!&quot; Sarah warned and then forced Kris to lay 
back while she dabbed at the wounds. She took a small bowl from a night 
stand that stood next to the bed and wrung the cloth out before touching 
it to Kris&#39;s face again. Kris winced and pulled back. &quot;Sorry,&quot; Sarah 
said nervously. 

Kris touched her chest and could feel that her ribs were bruised, &quot;I 
must look like a mess,&quot; She half laughed. Sarah ignored the attempt at 
humor and dropped the towel back in the bowl which was now tinted pink 
from the blood. Kris&#39;s cheek was badly cut, and there was a gash mark 
across her forehead as well as one along the right side of her chin. Her 
left hand and arm were scraped and there were a number of bruises over 
her body, from her head to her arms and chest. Never mind all the scars 
that Sarah couldn&#39;t fathom how someone could survive through. When Sarah 
was taking Kris&#39;s shirt off she noticed a pair of angry scars across 
each of the girl&#39;s wrists. Right now she couldn&#39;t keep herself from 
looking at them. 

Kris noticed what the girl was staring at and raised her hands into the 
air. She slowly turned them over in front of her, &quot;To think these hands 
are supposed to be artist hands. Able to create works of beauty with a 
sweep of them,&quot; Kris mumbled. Sarah continued to watch, confused as to 
what Kris was narrating. Kris resumed, &quot;but would you believe that with 
all the skill that these hands hold I could never do anything to save 
those that I truly loved.&quot; A tear began to form in her eye. Kris didn&#39;t 
make a move to wipe it away. Instead kept turning her hands over and 
over again. 

Sarah cautiously reached out and took the left hand in her&#39;s, &quot;No, don&#39;t 
blame yourself. Jason is just an idiot. I&#39;ll tell the teachers on him 
and they will solve everything.&quot;

Kris turned her head to look up at Sarah. Her blue eyes started to show 
how truly tired she was, Kris turned away and stared at the ceiling, 
&quot;Jennifer tried to get involved. She tried to get to boys to stop 
beating on me everyday.&quot; The tears started to roll down her face and hit 
the pillow, &quot;She was stronger than me. Braver than anyone I ever knew. 
I&#39;d like to believe that she fought until her final breath. That she was 
strong all the way to the end.&quot; Kris let out a tired sob, &quot;I can still 
hear
her crying out for me in the night. She is everywhere, but I can never 
touch her again.&quot; She looked at the scars on her wrists, &quot;I tried to 
join her, but I failed; I failed her in life and I failed her in death.&quot; 

Sarah tried to think of some way to comfort her friend&#39;s pains, &quot;It 
wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot; She said. 

Kris looked at Sarah again, &quot;Wasn&#39;t it? Maybe if I didn&#39;t look so much 
like a boy. I could have tried harder  to dress like everyone else. Then 
maybe... maybe...&quot; Kris trailed off thinking of all the &#39;maybe&#39;s&#39; and 
&#39;could have&#39;s&#39;, &quot;And what about you? We have only known each other for a 
short time and look at what I&#39;ve done to your life. Tonight I could have 
lost you because of my stupidity and I can&#39;t go through something like 
that again.&quot; She rolled over so her back was to Sarah and whispered &quot;I 
can&#39;t, I&#39;m sorry....&quot;

Sarah confusion rose. Here she thought that Kris was strong and brave, 
but what she didn&#39;t realize was that every day the girl was struggling 
to keep herself together, and no one offered a helping hand. She touched 
her own lips, then looked down at the sobbing girl that lay curled up in 
her bed. Noone, but herself.  She got up and turned out the lights, then 
returned and pulled off her house coat before crawling into bed next to 
her friend. 

Kris felt Sarah&#39;s body move close to her and her arm gently slip around 
Kris&#39;s waist. Kris rolled over to see Sarah laying beside her in the 
dark, brown eyes glistening in the night. Sarah was the first to speak, 
&quot;I didn&#39;t hurt you, did I?&quot; Sarah asked.

Kris shook her head. It had been a long time since she had felt a real 
body laying next to hers. She didn&#39;t know what to do, when she felt a 
pair of lips softly brush against her cheek, then to her lips. She 
closed her eyes and enjoyed the sensation that flowed through her body 
as the two of them softly kissed, Kris could no longer restrain the 
pressures that had built up inside of her. She wanted to be pet, she 
wanted to caress Sarah, she wanted to taste her. She finally gave in to 
the urges and allowed one of her hands slipped up Sarah&#39;s nightgown, 
slowly stroke the girl&#39;s leg, but when she opened her eyes Jennifer&#39;s 
face was floating in front of her. Kris pushed herself backwards until 
she hit the wall behind her. 

The light snapped on and Sarah looked over at Kris. The girl looked as 
if she had seen a ghost. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just....&quot; Sarah said with a 
blush. 

Kris closed her eyes tight and clenched her hand to the side of her 
head. She was so confused, was she really falling in love with the girl 
that sat before her or was she only in love with the idea and the 
memory? Her emotions got tied up in knots. She didn&#39;t want to forget 
Jennifer, at the same time she longed to be with Sarah. However she 
didn&#39;t just want to have sex. The internal struggle for her heart was so 
much that she was about to scream. &quot;I want to go home.&quot; Kris finally 
whispered. 

Sarah looked disappointed, &quot;Was it something I did? I mean...&quot; She 
stammered and began to get out of the bed.  

Kris reached out and grabbed Sarah by the arm forcing the girl to turn 
around a look at her, &quot;It is not your fault. It is all mine. I just...&quot; 
She felt the fog creep in and forced it at bay, &quot;I can&#39;t stand the idea 
of you getting hurt. I think it would be best if you stay away from me 
from now on.&quot; 

Sarah stood there in shock. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean...&quot; Tears 
started to fill her eyes. 

Kris was to her feet in an instant, wrapped her arms around the girl and 
whispered into her ear, &quot;It&#39;s not you, It&#39;s me. I can&#39;t forget her face, 
and the feeling of her touch. I... I can&#39;t fall in love again. I don&#39;t 
understand what I feel for you right now, but I&#39;m afraid that if I 
continue I&#39;ll only  hurt you more. Do you understand what I&#39;m trying to 
say?&quot;

Sarah slowly nodded and pulled Kris&#39;s closer, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She suddenly 
started to cry, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to hurt you. I really didn&#39;t.&quot; She 
rambled, &quot;It was their idea. I just...just...&quot; Tears fell from Sarah&#39;s 
cheeks to land on Kris&#39;s arm. 

Kris turned the girl around to look at her, &quot;You didn&#39;t hurt me...&quot; She 
started to state when Sarah violently shook her head. 

&quot;Yes I did.&quot; Sarah cried softly, &quot;They bet me to get close to you.&quot; She 
suddenly admitted, her voice  trembling, &quot;I was supposed to break up 
with you during the dance. You are just so nice that I couldn&#39;t do it.&quot; 
She said, ashamed of how she treated Kris, &quot;I didn&#39;t want to... I wanted 
you to touch me...&quot; she trailed off.

&quot;A bet?&quot; Kris was suddenly confused. Then she remembered Sarah was with 
her fan club during the first day of school. Kris clenched her fist as 
she realized that she was being played for a fool. Kris could feel the 
door to her heart slam shut, &quot;So that is how it is?&quot; She asked coldly.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know who you were.&quot; Sarah cried, &quot;Still you were so nice to 
me. Treated me so kindly. Why did you have to make it so hard?&quot; She 
asked between sobs. 

Kris stepped away from the girl in disgust, &quot;I can&#39;t believe I had 
feelings for you.&quot; She said lowering her head, &quot;Could I have my clothes? 
I want to leave.&quot; Kris ordered bluntly. 

&quot;But!&quot; Sarah started to protest, &quot;I lov...&quot;  

Kris cut the girl off before she could finish her sentence, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
but I can&#39;t love anymore. Never again.&quot; She concluded sorrowfully. 

&quot;I&#39;ll go see if your clothes are dry yet.&quot; Sarah quickly disappeared out 
the door. Leaving Kris to her thoughts. 

Kris crossed the room and looked around at all the posters that covered 
the wall, mostly boys&#39; bands and movie posters, and the stuffed animals 
that stood in a row across shelves that were nailed near the ceiling. 
She smiled at the girlish nature of the room. Nothing like her room or 
Jenn... How could she be so foolish? She should have known better than 
to let someone into her heart so easily. Did she actually love that 
girl? Not anymore. She considered if she could ever love Sarah, however 
the deception was to great on Kris&#39;s tender heart. She felt betrayed. 
Lost and truly alone. Tanya warned her and all Kris did was push her 
friend away. Now she had noone left.  

&quot;Here are your clothes,&quot; Sarah said from the doorway, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but 
they&#39;re still a little damp.&quot; 

Kris took her clothes, &quot;That is alright, Thank you.&quot; She quickly pulled 
on her pants and shirt. 

Sarah nervously fidgeted, &quot;Ummm... would you like me to walk you back to 
the school?&quot; She suggested.

Kris thought for a moment then shook her head, &quot;No, that&#39;s alright. If 
you could just point me in the right direction.&quot; Kris looked around, 
&quot;Where are my shoes?&quot; 

Sarah pointed down the hall, &quot;At the front door.&quot; 

Kris slipped past the girl and headed for the front door. She was in 
such a rush that it took her two times to get her heel into her shoe, 
then grabbed her jacket, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to run like this... I just...&quot; She 
tried to think of a good excuse. 

Sarah tried to act like none of this was bothering her, &quot;I guess... I&#39;ll 
see you at school then?&quot;

Kris straightened up and opened the door. She stood still as she looked 
out into the night. When she spoke she didn&#39;t turn around. &quot;Maybe...&quot; 
She said softly. 

&quot;Will you be alright on your own?&quot; Sarah asked concerned. 

&quot;I live... I always do...&quot; She left it at that and ran out into the cold 
night air. 

Sarah watched Kris disappear down the dark street. Only when the girl 
was out of sight did she let herself cry again, because she knew that 
even if she saw Kris again it wouldn&#39;t be the same. She felt like she 
just lost the best friend she ever had and maybe even the first person 
she&#39;d ever truly loved. 

Slowly she closed the door and walked to her room where she flopped into 
her bed and let out a deep mournful sob.
