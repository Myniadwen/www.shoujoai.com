<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/elkat.html">Elkat</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/necroknight-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a>  <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>Chapter 3: the Dragon&#39;s 
Den</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The knight and squire 
wasted no time in binding the woman and dressing themselves. Unfortunately 
for them neither the woman nor the slaves they freed were willing to 
tell them where the Dragon&#39;s Den is. For the slaves it was understandable, 
but no matter how much they threatened the woman, she wouldn&#39;t tell 
them what they wanted to know.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;You stole my face, 
my beautiful face why should I tell you anything?&quot; The woman hissed 
with her head ducked so low that her face was hidden.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Your loyalty is 
admirable, but it&#39;s in your best effort to tell us where you master 
is?&quot; Bones said, cracking her knuckles menacingly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The woman laughed hysterically. 
&quot;<i>My </i>master? Do not mistake me for one of those complacent 
little dolls that Long plays with! I only call him master out of respect, 
something truly admirable considering what he did to my real master!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Your real master?&quot; 

Shiko asked, confused.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I am Lady Weiming 
of the Tiger Clan, the former ruling family of Duslan&#39;! We ruled this 
city with fear, crushing anybody who stood against us, but then that 
slithering serpent worked his way through very fingers, dethroning our 
beloved master and humiliating her! Only by a merciful whim he let us 
live only to have us swear to serve under him! We have been forced to 
skulk around our own kingdom, waiting for the chance to pounce on that 
bastard Long and snap his little neck!&quot; The woman venomously said, 
lacing every word with toxic malice.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;m sorry for 
you lost, but that doesn&#39;t justify your actions. Once I&#39;ve brought down 
Long we shall return to relocate you to somewhere you can be more comfortable 
while you wait for your trial,&quot; the knight said, bowing. &quot;Shiko, 
we better get going. We&#39;ll have to find the Dragon&#39;s Den ourselves.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Right,&quot; Shiko 
said following after her master.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The sound of Marrow 
whimpering caught the elves&#39; attention. The tiger held the dog by the 
ruff of its neck and was sitting in the doorway.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Marrow!&quot; 
Bones cried running towards the tiger.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Bones-sensei wait!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The tiger ran outside 
with the knight and her squire in tow. The tiger ran down the streets, 
easily out running the girls, but stopping every so once to look back, 
starting up once again once they were close. Around every turn it took, 
it stopped to make sure they didn&#39;t get lost.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Why do I have 
a feeling this tiger is some sort of dues ex machina?&quot; Bones asked, 
looking at the tiger.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Hm, what do you 
mean?&quot; Shiko asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;After we wounded 
that woman, it went into the back to stop by the cage! At first one 
might consider it a coincidence, but now it has taken Marrow hostage 
and ran off with her, forcing us to follow her. She led us into any 
number of traps and we wouldn&#39;t be the wiser!&quot; the knight explained.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I don&#39;t think 
that is its intention though!&quot; The hunter said. &quot;I believe 
it trying to repay us! This may sound crazy, but I think it trusts us!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;In this world 
there are many crazy things that can&#39;t be explained, so I&#39;ve come accept 
to accept them. However, in this case, it doesn&#39;t seem particularly 
crazy at all,&quot; the knight said, nodding.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  They followed the tiger 
through a maze of streets until it abruptly stopped at the end of an 
alley, dropping the dog and laying low as though it were going to pounce.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Just before the elves 
could see the end of the ally clearly a number of figures passed by. 
Though the cloaks concealed their identity, they were suspiciously familiar. 
Among them, one even carried a scythe.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I wander what 
my new play thing is?&quot; one of the cloaked figures said. &quot;I 
hope that little tiger cub didn&#39;t break it… I&#39;ll have to take her 
head if she did!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind 
killing some people myself. Ever since our brethren had been defeated 
by that wretched knight, I&#39;ve had the urge to kill! It must be his persona. 
I wouldn&#39;t put it pass him to use our collective awareness to try to 
try and reborn himself into one of our bodies,&quot; the figure said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;You reapers are 
quite queer, but then I see the use of knowing what happens to each 
other. If one of you goes down, you can use the battle to learn how 
the enemy attacks and gain an upper hand when you try to seek him out,&quot; 
the first figure said. &quot;Now where was the White Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe…?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  By the time that the 
knight and her squire caught up, the cloaked figures had reached the 
end of the street and turned. Unfortunately, without wasting a second, 
the tiger grabbed Marrow by the scruff of her neck again and dashed 
off.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <i>(It stopped, but 
something was different this time… We were already to close for it 
to be concerned for us loosing it. It was almost like it was hiding 
from something…) </i>the knight thought. &quot;(Shiko-san, how many 
arrows do you have left?)&quot; She whispered to her squire.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(Three,)&quot; 

the girl whispered her reply.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(That&#39;s not very 
good and I&#39;ve used a lot of mana. If we get ambushed, don&#39;t waste any 
resources; aim to kill!)&quot; The knight whispered.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(Right!)&quot; 
The girl nodded her understanding.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  They continued to follow 
the tiger until it reached a black five by ten building that they almost 
didn&#39;t see due to the unlit darkness of the night. Black banners bearing 
the golden Chinese character of &quot;long&quot; were draped over either 
side of a steel door and ornamental dragon statues lined the roof of 
the building, clutching in their three toed claws a golden orb. Though 
it was quite small and plain, it held grandeur of its own design. The 
elves were too observed with gawking at the small building to notice 
that the tiger had dropped Marrow once again until it nudged the door 
open with a soft, but low and thunderous sound that could be hearing 
echoing within the building.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Is this it?&quot; 
Bones asked no in particular, though she almost assumed the tiger would 
answer her anyways.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Unfortunately the tiger 
didn&#39;t make any move to enter the building, but face the elves and lowered 
itself upon its forelegs only in a quadrupedal form of bowing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The knight was at loss 
for words. Though she liked to believe that animals could comprehend 
what they were saying, she never expected to be sentient enough to have 
manners. <i>(Maybe it&#39;s been train… Then again, I can&#39;t say that for 
certain considering its last master wasn&#39;t quite that kind or caring…)</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Um, arigato Tora-san!&quot; 

Shiko said bowing to the tiger in return.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Ditto!&quot; Bones 
said, making a quick bow before kneeling beside Marrow to check her 
for injuries. The fact that the dog wasn&#39;t moving caused her to worry, 
but further investigation revealed the dog merely lost consciousness. <i>
(I can&#39;t really blame you there. I&#39;d probably do the same thing if I 
were to be carried off by a large, killer beast.)</i> She gently shook 
the dog and whispered her name, but Marrow didn&#39;t stir.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Is she alright?&quot; 

Shiko asked, looking at the dog with concern.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Yeah, she just 
passed out from fear. It seems she&#39;s out pretty deep, the only thing 
could possible wake her would be the smell of food,&quot; the knight 
said, shaking her head and sighing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Almost as if cued the 
dog&#39;s nose twitched and her eyes flew wide open. Sniffing the air frequently, 
she got to her feet faster than either of the elves could react and 
started to follow whatever scent she had found into the building.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Marrow wait!&quot; 
Bone exclaimed, trying to grab the dog, but she was outpaced by the 
dog&#39;s one track mind. &quot;Damn it! Shiko keep an on the tiger! I should 
be right out!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Right!&quot; the 
girl said, looking towards where she remembered the tiger being. Her 
eyes widened with shock when she saw no tiger there or anywhere in sight. 
&quot;Um, Bones-sensei…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me; 
the tiger&#39;s gone,&quot; the knight said, groaning inwardly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; 

the girl cried.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;It&#39;s ok. Well 
then just stand guard,&quot; the knight said before disappearing into 
the building.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Right!&quot; The 
girl said standing by the door and gazing in the opposite direction.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <i>Yelp!</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><i>  </i>

Bones didn&#39;t like hearing that yelp, but took no more than five steps 
in the unlit building before she ended up tumbling down what she could 
assume to be stairs. As she reached even ground, with the room around 
swirling about in a nauseating pattern, she realized that the stairs 
came to stop though her mind wasn&#39;t exactly capable of much more a few 
seconds afterwards. When her senses aligned and her brain regain its 
ability to make complex thought, she began to look herself over to insure 
that she sustained no injuries. Thankfully finding none, she began to 
look for Marrow who happened to be lying not very far from her. She 
was too concerned with the dog&#39;s safety to realize the room that she 
was now in was lit, though no more than allow her to make a general 
check-up on the Sheltie.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;My, my, I was 
thinking my sister had forgotten how to knock when all together new 
faces coming tumbling down the stairs! I must admit I had to restrain 
myself from indulging in the rather comical manner you fell. It reminded 
so much of those cartoons I used to watch as a kid. Hopefully no serious 
wounds have come to either you or your pet,&quot; spoke a man behind 
the knight.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Spinning on heel, she 
looked at a man sitting on an overstuff coach with two identical twin 
girls draped on him from either side. &quot;Are you master Long?&quot; 
Bones asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Before I answer 
your question, who are you? You face is quite familiar, but I have no 
means to identify it. You see my memory has seemed to have faded in 
the last thirty years,&quot; the man said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I am Gutou Daiyu-&quot; 
the knight began, but she was abruptly cut off.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Impossible. Unless 
you have found the secret to internal youth, you can&#39;t possibly be her. 
She would be old enough to be your mother, my child, so I&#39;ll ask again 
who you are?&quot; the man said, waving his hand dismissively. &quot;Or 
should I answer for you Gutou Sui?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;H, how do you 
know that name!?!&quot; The knight cried, grabbing the man by his changshan. 
Her eyes were wide surprise and anger. The only person that ever called 
her by that name was her mother and until now she had believed the only 
person to know that name was only her mother too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Calm down, little 
one. I will tell you everything, but you should want to let go of me- 
if you want to live,&quot; the man said calmly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Bones was about to argue, 
but she then felt something prick her cheek. Out of the corner of her 
eye she could see freshly drawn blood sliding down a nearly visible 
thread. <i>(Nylon wire!?!)</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;If you haven&#39;t 
realized your predicament yet, my Dragon Ladies are each armed with 
refined nylon wire that has the strength of a chain of iron and the 
sharpness of a razor blade. Its thinness makes it nearly invisible to 
the naked eye. Any attempt on my health and these two girls will chop 
you apart so I suggest you calm down and let go of me, okay?&quot; the 
man said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Reluctantly the knight 
let go of the man watched as several threads of string unwound from 
several different areas of her body.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Good, now please 
have a seat, I&#39;ll have a few my of other girls lead in your friend from 
above. I have a lot I want to discuss with you, daughter of Slave Princess 

&#39;Daiyu&#39;…&quot; the man said.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The White Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe 
laid in smoldering pools of molten marble. The slaves that were once 
housed within it lay on the street, their corpses bearing minimal wounds 
outside of the abuse from the former master and the death wounds that 
took their life.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;As you wished, 
I made sure that I didn&#39;t mar their bodies more than I needed, though 
to be honest they didn&#39;t even give up a fight and made it all too easy, 
spoke the scythe wielding cloaked figure. &quot;It&#39;s almost a shame.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;And the tiger 
cub?&quot; Asked Neco Lee, the hood of her cloak dropped to give her 
a wider field of vision.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;No where in sight, 
she must have fled from the scene. Have you found your gift?&quot; the 
scythe wielder replied, gesturing towards a pile of clothing that it 
had taken from the clothier before destroying it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I doubt any of 
this would even qualify as a gift. Long only dabbles in slaves and narcotics 
and there&#39;s really neither here except for his usual wares… I guess 
the cub ran off with it. I&#39;m not particularly clear how many tigers 
are in this city still, but I doubt I have enough girls including the 
new arrivals to handle them. I guess we&#39;ll have to head back and ask 
for his help. I hate doing other people&#39;s work!&quot; the necrophiliac 
moaned, shaking her head disapprovingly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I wander if that 
knight would show up if we stir up enough trouble?&quot; the scythe 
wielder said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I don&#39;t think  
he&#39;d mine if you went looking for the cub in the red light district. 
If I remember correctly, that is autonomously controlled,&quot; The 
elf replied, waving its fellow off dismissively.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;ll keep an eye 
out for that present of yours,&quot; the scythe wielder said, walking 
off.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;My, my, what a 
waste. Such beautiful skin scarred,&quot; the woman said as squatted 
beside one of the slaves&#39; corpses and stroked it lovingly. &quot;I&#39;ll 
have to make the cub pay for playing with you so roughly!&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Bones couldn&#39;t stand 
the look of shame that Shiko bared as she was escorted by two women 
dressed in matching uniforms consisting of a black qipao with long, 
voluminous sleeves, black trousers, black shoes and a black dou li with 
a black veil that covered the entire face bearing the character of &quot;long&quot; 

on its front. The girl refused to look her master in her eye, believing 
that she had failed her duty.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  She hadn&#39;t a chance 
to fight back. Once they appeared, she reached for her quiver to find 
that it had been cut off and several nearly invisible threads entangled 
her. She didn&#39;t waste any time realizing the cutting properties of the 
thread and was forced to obey them. She had made to look like a fool 
and surely dishonored Bones. Though it seemed odd that her master and 
Marrow was sitting idly before Long and his girls, she saw the cut on 
the knight&#39;s cheek and knew that they had been forced into the same 
predicament. The girl&#39;s heart ached with despair when was forced to 
sit right beside her beloved master that she had failed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s 
all my fault,&quot; the knight dryly said. &quot;I should known better 
than to try barging without knowing anything about the enemy&#39;s number 
or power. I had not only put myself in danger, but you and Marrow. I 
hope they didn&#39;t harm you on my behalf.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The squire was shocked 
to hear her master take the blame on herself. Tears beaded on rims of 
her eyes, but she quickly wiped them away. &quot;No, it&#39;s my fault. 
I had been more aware of surroundings; I could have lent you back up.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I hate to be rude, 
but can&#39;t we just skip the whole &#39;it&#39;s my fault&#39; skit? I&#39;m not very 
fond of pointless arguments, listening to them or participating in them. 
Besides I have an important customer I&#39;m waiting upon to return,&quot; 
Long said, waving his hand. &quot;Besides I have many questions to ask 
you Gutou Soi. First, how&#39;s your mother? I heard she fled into the Gaiose 
Forest after leading the slave revolution and usurping the Tigers.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;She&#39;s dead,&quot; 
the knight said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Oh my! How tragic! 
Please tell me, did she go peacefully?&quot; the man asked with an air 
of interest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;No… She died 
fighting,&quot; the knight said, hiding her face so that none could 
see her grief as the memories of how she lost her entire family resurfaced.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;m very surprised. 
She was a true warrior and it seems she has passed her will on to you. 
Now what brings you here?&quot; the man asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I need a new blade,&quot; 
Bones said after some hesitation. She reached into her bag and retrieved 
the pouch that contained her nodachi and Skullguard uniform. Pulling 
the pouch open, she reached in and drew forth the nodachi. Unsheathing 
the sword, she revealed what remained of the blade.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;What in hell did 
that!?!&quot; The man said, shocked. He took the sword from her and 
looked over. &quot;It was melted, but how is that possible? This blade 
should be able to resist the flames of hell!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I transmuted it 
into Soulpiercing Silver,&quot; the knight said, looking away embarrassedly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The man was speechless. 
After a long moment of silence he finally began to speak up, &quot;You 
are just as reckless as your mother. I gave her this sword as a sign 
of trust and before I knew it she broken the blade in the revolution. 
I swear! You women have no idea how hard it is to come by a silver blade 
of this quality.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; 
the knight whispered, bowing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;It won&#39;t be cheap, 
but I think I might have a spare blade lying around,&quot; Long said 
as he turned the blade over in his hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;No matter the 
price, my order will reimburse you,&quot; the knight offered.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Order? What kind 
of order is that?&quot; the man said looking at her with interest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <i>(Crap! I said too 
much!) </i>Bones thought, the color draining from her face.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;As I remember, 
your mother had fallen in love with a knight from the order of the Cryptkeepers. 
I&#39;ve met him once, though I don&#39;t remember his name, I knew he was quite 
a honorable man. I also see much of him in you and wouldn&#39;t be surprised 
if you followed in his foot steps,&quot; the man said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;My entire family, 
including my father and mother, are dead… I&#39;m the only survivor,&quot; 
Bones said, closing her eyes and sighing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;So you have become 
an avenger?&quot; the man said, sounding disappointed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;No. An avenger 
seeks to get back at the one who had caused their dismay. I cannot avenge 
my family for it was my fault nor am I disillusioned enough to believe 
killing a single person will make things right! They are dead and will 
remain dead, there&#39;s nothing I can do to change that! Besides, not only 
my family, but the entire village I once lived in suffered because of 
my folly! I refused to make that mistake again and I refuse to let that 
man to do as he wishes if it means he would make others suffer! By the 
Necronomicon I swear I will punish him for every crime he has committed!&quot; 
the knight exclaimed. &quot;And what your crimes cannot be forgiven!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The man laughed. &quot;Yes, 
I am a sinner. To quench my endless greed, I sell human lives and biochemical 
weapons to other sinners, but I am not heartless. I treat my slaves 
with respect and humanity. What their masters do to them after they&#39;re 
sold is none of my concern, but I do not take any pleasure in knowing 
what will eventually happen to them. If only I can bring order to this 
sinful city.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Order?&quot; Bones 
asked, confused.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;You may think 
I thrive off this chaos, but that is only half-true. I thrive because 
I can make adapt to the situation. I do not take any pride in my business, 
but in order to achieve my ultimate goal, I must lay low and wait for 
my chance as I had back when the Tiger clan ruled this city. In fact 
it was all thanks to your mother that I had my chance; a brave woman 
she is. However I fear her effort may have gone to waste as I control 
all, but the slums where the tigers have raised their own filthy businesses 
to cover their covert activities to ruin the name of my clan and take 
the city back! They stand in my way of achieving true order in this 
town! If this order of yours is at all lawful as you claim, then you 
should understand my situation!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;This Tiger clan, 
by chance do they own the White Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe?&quot; Shiko asked 
out of curiosity.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;They currently 
do, though I have set out rather trustworthy ally of mine to deal with 
them and retrieve something that they have taken from me. I plan on 
using this an example of what will happen. Hopefully by eliminating 
them, I can restore this city to its former glory,&quot; the man said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;And how long will 
this former glory hold before it falls back into the chaos? How do you 
plan on maintaining your hold over this entire city? By fear?&quot; 
the knight asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;No, no! I do not 
need to resort to such petty tactics as use police brutality to keep 
the people in line. What I truly need is a powerful ally. I here there 
was an order of knights that have been eying this town, but unable to 
make a move to take it and resort control. I plan upon establishing 
my full control of Duslan&#39; to contact them with a simple and fair deal. 
Lend me their aid in keeping the order and I&#39;ll allow them jurisdiction 
within the walls. I&#39;ll even lend them the full authority over these 
girls, who are among my elite Dragon Ladies and control my entire forces! 
What more can I offer?&quot; Long said, gesturing towards the girls 
on either side of him. &quot;If my memory serves, they were called the 
Skullguard.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;If that is your 
desire, then I can act as a liaison between you and the order, but you 
must do something for me to prove your sincerity!&quot; the knight said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;If you mean the 
sword, I&#39;ll repair it on account of my debt to your mother and nothing 
more. As the lawful type, I doubt you&#39;d be interested in any of my common 
wares… I&#39;ll search my stock house for something truly valuable for 
you, though it might take some time. I&#39;ll assign you a room in the Drunken 
Dragon Inn and to show that I&#39;m not planning on killing you in your 
sleep I&#39;ll even lend you my girls,&quot; the man placed his hands at 
each of the girl&#39;s necks and began to chant. &quot;Sealing the soul, 
chains of silver, bind and control!&quot; An area of light around each 
of the girl&#39;s neck began to glow with a green light. As a silver collar 
materialized around each of the girl&#39;s necks, the light began to fall 
from the collar in a narrow line that materialized into a silver chain.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Collars of Corpse 
Command!&quot; the knight said in surprise.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Eh?&quot; Shiko 
looked at her master in confusion.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Made of Soulpiercing 
Silver, collars of corpse command force the person who syncs with it 
or else suffer Soulpiercing and risk having the thread of their soul 
be cut. Generally they are only used on full automatic animation types 
of undead such as liches and vampires,&quot; the knight explained.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;As you said, these 
girls are quite dead, as are all of my Dragon Ladies and each where 
a collar of command synced to these two girls. The collars these girls 
are wearing have yet to be synced to anybody so it&#39;s up to you to do 
so yourself. Simply just grab the chains and make the contract of command,&quot; 

Long said, holding his hand out to the knight and her squire.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;ll do it. My 
squire has little knowledge of the dark arts and wouldn&#39;t be able to 
rebound from the syncing process,&quot; the knight said, &quot;But I 
must know their names first.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Long Yi and Long 
Liang,&quot; the man said, making no move to point which was which as 
he said their names.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;One… and Two…?&quot; 

Bones said, looking at the girls with a mixture of confusion and embarrassment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well those are 
quite interesting names,&quot; Shiko stated.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The knight kneeled before 
the girls, grabbing the chains that dangled at their feet and closed 
her eyes. &quot;I, Bones of the Skullguard, claim possession of the 
individuals, Long Yi and Long Liang! As long as I live, my every command 
is law until the contract is broken or rendered null and void.&quot; 
The chains in her hand began to glow black, starting at the sections 
held in the knight&#39;s hand and drifting down the chain to the collar 
before fading. The chains dispersed except for the links in her hand 
which became two silver rings in her hand. Sliding the rings onto each 
of her hands, she sighed and said, &quot;The contract has been sealed.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Now that is done, 
these girls will gladly direct towards the Drunken Dragon Inn. I will 
call upon you once your sword is repaired,&quot; Long said as the girls 
got up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Right this way, 
master,&quot; the girls said at the same time, gesturing up the stairs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Thank you,&quot; 
Bones said, bowing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  As the knight, her squire 
and the dog got up the girls began to climb the stairs with the trio 
in tow.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;My debt to you 
is beyond measuring, milady!&quot; Weiming said bowing before a woman 
laid before her.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Weiming, you are 
too humble. I no longer am the queen of Duslan&#39;, yet you treat me as 
such. Address me by Xiaojie,&quot; the woman said. A dread elf of unimaginable 
beauty, she laid atop a tiger skin rug, her over coat and robe hanging 
immodestly open to expose the pale, supple flesh underneath. Strewn 
about her were various other girls in various forms of dress, the iron 
collars they wore clearly marking them as slaves. The woman&#39;s bangs 
were cropped around her forehead where the character &quot;Wang&quot; 
could be seen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;But to address 
milady like she was some lowly prostitute! I cannot!&quot; the woman 
said, shaking her head.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Your innocence 
is beyond understanding. Now put formalities aside as we more pressing 
matters at hand. You say that a girl who resembles the Slave Princess 
Daiyu has not only showed up, but made a mockery of my cubs and now 
challenges the Dragon… As much as I want to believe they&#39;d kill one 
another, the fact that serpent was a conspirer to the Slave Princess. 
I can only assume it would only be time before he has convinced this 
look alike to finish what they started. She is a threat and must be 
eliminated at once,&quot; the woman said, take a puff at her pipe and 
breathing out smoke. &quot;Prepare the War Tigers at once.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Yes milady,&quot; 
Weiming bowed and rose to leave.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Just then an out of 
breath girl threw the wide double doors of the darkly lit room open, 
standing doubled over and out of breath. &quot;Lady Hu Hou, the brothels 
are under attack!&quot; The girl cried in horror.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The pipe fell onto the 
ground, flicking ashes onto the tiger skin rug. &quot;WHAT!?!&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">---</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The red light district 
of Duslan&#39; was alit with bright blue flames as a scythe wielding cloaked 
figure ran about, killing all that tried to escape the burning brothels. 
The only distinction between the prostitutes and their customers that 
the assailant made was the matter in which it killed them. The men were 
cut down without mercy with the death wounds aimed where the scythe 
hit while the poor and unfortunate women forced to die screaming as 
their legs and arms were sliced away so that they didn&#39;t get away, quickly 
dying from blood loss. Since it wasn&#39;t aware of what Neco Lee&#39;s present 
even looked like, it was left to guess and to be safe, it made sure 
to kill anything it expected to the present in manner most easily overlooked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The assailant nimbly 
jumped aside as a Shen Baio flew past. The assailant continuously evaded 
as several more Shen Baio came flying towards it. &quot;What do we have 
hear?&quot; the assailant asked watching as several female warriors 
clad in white robes and black armor.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Pulling the Shen Baio&#39;s 
chain back, they retrieved their chain-darts. &quot;We are Lady Hu Hou&#39;s 
elite warriors, the War Tigers and upon the name of the Tiger Clan shall 
not let you go unpunished!&quot; roared one of the warriors.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Is that so?&quot; 
the assailant asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The Shen Baio shot forward 
faster than the assailant had time to react. Ensnaring the cloaked figured, 
the warriors held the chain-dart firmly while others rushed forward 
with hook swords drawn in pairs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Fiery lush, charcoaled 
flesh, burn everything I touch!&quot; the cloaked figure exploded in 
bright blue flames just as the War Tigers were within striking range, 
setting them alit and engulfing the chains. The chains melted in pools 
of molten metal around the now exposed body of the assailant which was 
no more than a charred skeleton as the warriors fell to the ground and 
rolled about in a futile attempt to put out the fire. &quot;Fools! Nothing 
can extinguish my hellfire! Now burn in the flames of hell! Sulfur taste, 
fiery breath, reduce everything to smoldering waste!&quot; The charred 
skeleton breathed a jet of bright blue flames at the remaining warriors.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Who dares attack 
the Tiger Clan!?!&quot; Demanded a voice from ahead of the reaper. By 
now that person was dressed, it was unmistakably Weiming though her 
face was hidden behind a porcelain mask.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I am, but just 
a murder reborn from the flames of hell who now seeks to kill all that 
lives. And who may you be?&quot; the reaper said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I am the Weiming 
of the Tiger Clan! Under the guidance of my lady I shall put stop to 
your rampage!&quot; the woman declared, snapping her whip at the reaper. 
Before it could even reach the reaper it exploded into flames that raced 
towards her hand. &quot;What the hell!?!&quot; She cried, dropping the 
whip and jumping back.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;You aren&#39;t a smart 
one are you? Don&#39;t you see smoldering piles of ashes around you? Those 
were you friends before they played with my fire! You can&#39;t touch me! 
Now before I kill, I have a very important question. Are you the little 
cub that stole Mistress Lee&#39;s present?&quot; the reaper asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;You mean the tiger. 
Well if you want it, you&#39;re too late. The same woman who stole my face 
took the tiger with her!&quot; Weiming said. &quot;Too bad you&#39;re going 
to die!&quot; Reaching into her sleeves, she drew a number of daggers 
in each and tossed them at the reaper. As the flying daggers touched 
the blue fire, they melted into puddles of molten steel at the reaper&#39;s 
feet.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Then I will have 
to find that woman and kill her myself, but not before you tell everything 
you know about her!&quot; the reaper said, rushing forward.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Weiming turned away 
from the flaming assailant and ran off as fast as she could. <i>(Damn 
it! I can&#39;t touch him while he&#39;s enveloped with those flames… I hope 
you have escaped safely, milady…)</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Deafen the hearing, 
turn to black, spherical searing!&quot; As the reaper completed its 
spell, fire that covered its body flew forth as a massive ball of fire, 
swiftly trailing behind the fleeing woman.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Weiming ducked into 
an alley just in time to escape the fireball that left all in its wake 
in ashes. Even after the ball had passed she could smell sulfur in the 
air. She didn&#39;t realized the smell was coming from behind until a skeletal 
hand grabber her by the shoulder, causing her to reflexively peer behind 
her. A startled gasp escaped her masked face as she saw the charcoaled 
skeleton grab her by the mask.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Her screams echoed through 
the night, but were muted by the roar of the unholy flames that lit 
the moonless night.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Bones woke in a cold 
sweat. For once that dream didn&#39;t plague her sleeping mind and the warmth 
of Shiko&#39;s naked body allowed her to fall asleep without any trouble, 
but something tore her away from her peaceful sleep. She wasn&#39;t sure 
what it was, but she had a feeling that it wasn&#39;t good. Looking to the 
side of her bed, her eyes grew as large as shields.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The tiger from before 
sat beside the bed looking at them with curiosity.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <i>(What is it doing 
in here? Did those girls let it in here?)</i> The knight wandered looking 
it in the eyes. <i>(Wait… Where&#39;s Marrow?) </i>
Before the knight could become worried, she heard the whimper of dog 
coming from under the bed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The tiger got up and 
made its way towards the window.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The knight followed 
the big cat with her eyes though as soon as it reached the window her 
eyes were torn to the window. Though she was more than sure it was still 
night, the window was lit with a bright, unnatural light. Silently slipping 
out of her bed and creeping towards the window, she gasped in horror. 
From the farthest end of the city the unmistakable flames of hellfire 
burned brightly, covering several blocks. Throwing the curtains shut, 
she quickly got dressed, soundlessly opened the door and slipped out 
of the room before shutting it silently.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Is something wrong?&quot; 

the girls asked in her unison.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;The city&#39;s on 
fire!&quot; the knight exclaimed as quietly as she could.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;No need to worry, 
it&#39;s only the slums where the Tiger clan are and it&#39;s self-contained 
so there&#39;s no need to fear it spreading,&quot; the girls said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Those flames are 
hellfire! There&#39;s only one person that can manipulate hellfire!&quot; 

Bones said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Ah, Master&#39;s usual 
customer did come with a quite an interesting looking fellow! He was 
a charred black skeleton and he carried a scythe. I wander if that could 
be him?&quot; the girls said, looking to one another.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  (Another hellborn skeleton?) 
The knight thought her pace pale. &quot;I have to stop it before it 
kills everyone in this city!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Um… I don&#39;t 
think it would be in your best interests to meddle! He is a guest of 
an important customer and if you interfere, we&#39;ll loose her!&quot; the 
girls said looking to one another.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Who is this damn 
customer that is so important that you&#39;d put the lives of the innocent 
at danger to appease?&quot; the woman asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Why master&#39;s half-sister; 
Neco Lee!&quot; the girls said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Without warning, the 
knight ran out of the Black Dragon Inn and down the street. <i>(Damn 
it! No wonder she had disappeared without a trace; she must have been 
recruited by that man! But what can she doing here Duslan?) </i>
The knight thought as she sprinted towards the fire.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Onee-chan what 
are we going to do? She harms mistress Lee well loose an important customer, 
but if we let mistress hurt her, Master Long would get angry at us!&quot; 
one of the two girls exclaimed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Don&#39;t worry Imoto-chan! 
We&#39;ll just keep them apart! But we cant just stop her because of the 
collars. We&#39;ll send the Dragon Ladies. She has command over us, but 
not them! If we order them to stall her, we should be able to lead Mistress 
Lee away!&quot; The other said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Wow, Onee-chan, 
why didn&#39;t I think of that?&quot; the first asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;You did, we share 
a single mind!&quot; the other girl pointed out.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;O&#39; almighty Dragon 
of the Heavens, we plea before you! Grant us your fangs!&quot; Chanting 
at the same time, the girls slapped their hands together and struck 
the ground. Under their palms a light glowed, forming a pentagram under 
them. Intensifying to the point of being blinding, the light faded away, 
revealing nine identically dressed as the figures who had escorted Shiko 
into the Dragon&#39;s Den standing around them. &quot;Follow the knight 
and make sure she stays as far away from the mistress Lee and her companion.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The nine women bowed 
and sprinted off after the knight.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Imoto-chan you 
find Mistress Lee and her companions and keep them from the knight, 
I&#39;ll inform master,&quot; one of the two girls said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Right!&quot; The 
other girl said, leaping through the window to land on the ground safely 
three stories below. Sprinting into a nearby alley, she began to weave 
through the back streets of the city, which held many shortcuts especially 
to the red light district.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;The other girl 
should be safe on her own… I hope,&quot; the remaining girl said as 
she followed as the first. As she entered the alley, she turned the 
opposite direction which lead to the Dragon&#39;s Den.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">---</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The voices of the knight 
and the twins stirred Shiko from her sleep. Still groggy she laid half 
asleep in the bed, not able to comprehend any of what was being said. 
By the time the last of the twins had left, her mind was awake enough 
to register a wet tongue licking her on the cheek. She had been feeling 
for some time after the knight left the room, but she was too far still 
asleep to realize that it wasn&#39;t Bones. Now, with all senses working 
properly, her heart stopped dead in her tracks as she looked at the 
source of the mystery tongue. Laying atop of her over the sheets was 
a naked humanoid figure with the ears and tail of a cat. Though her 
hair was black, the fur pattern on her feline appendages was that of 
a tiger&#39;s and around her neck was an unmistakable golden collar.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;T, Tora-sama?&quot; 
the hunter asked a sinking feeling in her stomach.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Now that we&#39;re 
alone, I can thank you personally for saving me back there,&quot; the 
girl said, slipping under the blankets.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Wait! I&#39;m already 
in a relationship! I&#39;m grateful for everything you did for us, but, 
but I can&#39;t!&quot; the squire said, trying her best to push the tiger-girl 
off her, but she wasn&#39;t capable of competing with the muscles that rippled 
across her tanned flesh.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Come now, don&#39;t 
be like that…&quot; the tiger said, lowering in to kiss the hunter.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Wow, I don&#39;t think 
I&#39;ve seen such a creature! I&#39;ve been looking all over for you, present!&quot; 
spoke Neco Lee leaning against the door way of the bed room door. &quot;Though 
I never expected to get two cute girls tonight!&quot; Stepping out of 
the door, her entourage of cloaked figures shuffled in, drawing kama 
from under their cloaks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Don&#39;t worry; I 
won&#39;t let them hurt you!&quot; the tiger-girl said. A soft golden glow 
enveloped her as the girl transformed into the tiger she was before.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Remember girls, 
keeping the wounds to a minimum!&quot; Neco Lee said, laughing sadistically 
to herself.</font></p>
