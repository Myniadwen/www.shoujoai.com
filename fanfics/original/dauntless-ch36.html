<p>“Campfire: four stories are told”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It had been a rough first day, but  finally the small party had overcome the unexpected tribulation and  scratched out a living in the lonely wilderness. Their troubles were  by far the worst, however—not because of any outstanding  impediments or forces beyond their control, but by inner conflict,  one of the deadliest forces in history. Lillianne Markus was in the  party, spoiled rotten and vain, selfish and manipulative and heedless  of others’ feelings, but could be amicable enough amongst those who  could take care of their own problems and didn’t incur her wrath.  Naja Elapidae was there as well, outraged that her quest for the Nail  of Saigrim had been substantially delayed, in need of something to  take her emotional and sexual frustrations out on. On the opposite  side of the spectrum was Dr. Fuuka Fujiwara, a gentle and innocent  soul who nonetheless had made two bitter enemies during her tenure  aboard the <em>Dauntless</em>, now encamped with them through a freak  twist of fate. To balance this radical tension out was Kate Shepherd,  strong in mind, body, and spirit, capable of holding her own against  the two fighters but smart enough to reason with the doctor.</p>
<p>After forcing themselves to coexist  for a few hours, the four women decided that their energies were best  spent searching for their companions, and they spent most of the day  wandering: Naja and Lil in one group, Fuuka and Kate in the other.  Their first search was fruitless, but at least it wore them all out,  so by the time night fell, nobody was in the mood to fight. They lit  a fire and roasted some game they had caught (Fuuka preferred to  snack on the wild fruits and vegetables they found), and for awhile,  there was peace. Kate still noticed that her three companions were  eyeing one another with contempt, so she decided to break the tension  by suggesting they each tell a story. To make things fair, they would  go in alphabetical order, which meant that Naja was going first  (which pleased her).</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was a wet and windy night when  Fsysh went out to overthrow her mother. The old woman had been in  control of the Hshiirmdu business for too many years, and it was time  to replace her with fresh blood. Fsysh had been her mother’s  favored apprentice and most trusted advisor ever since graduating  from Getzka Academy, so it was only fair that she smear her mother’s  reputation. Years of living under the same roof as the old woman had  given Fsysh astounding insight into her mother’s dealings, and she  knew just which corruption she wanted to expose. Events began to fall  into place as Fsysh grew closer to her mother, seducing those who  worked under her, gleaning information from people the old woman  trusted—even more than she trusted her own daughter.</p>
<p>When the time came for the old woman  to be dethroned, Fsysh invited the local chief of police to her  house, timing the visit so that her mother would not be able to  prepare for company. Fsysh led the chief through their house, down a  hallway and into a basement, where her mother kept her most  incriminating sin behind a trick wall. Fsysh grinned with ecstasy as  she showed the officer how to open it with a switch, and they  proceeded deep into the dark catacombs beneath </p>
<p>the house. Before Fsysh and her  family moved in, the house had once been used as a burial for  Elshyrin nobles—how ironic that a dark secret would be exhumed in  this place!</p>
<p>When they came to the end of the  mausoleum, the officer pointed his light to the final room. Inside  was equipment used to make suitcases, belts, book covers, shoes, and  other necessities. The last thing the officer saw before screaming  and dropping his light was a container that read, “genuine  snakeskin leather”.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Pretty scary, huh?”</p>
<p>“That was awful!” Fuuka  exclaimed. “What was the point of that story, anyway?”</p>
<p>“”It’s a classic scary story  that Elshyrin kids tell each other! It always gave me the willies  when I was young!”</p>
<p>“I don’t get it,” Kate  shrugged.</p>
<p>“Yeah, that was lame,” Lil  yawned. Naja shoved her scaly foot in the fire, erupting sparks and  embers to signify her rage.</p>
<p>“You charlatans wouldn’t know a  work of art if it raped you! That story’s guaranteed to give any  Elshyrin nightmares for a week!”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, but we’re not  Elshyrin,” Kate pointed out. Naja snorted and crossed her arms  angrily, muttering and cursing to herself. While she was defending  her race’s horror stories, Lil gave Fuuka a nasty look and a  nastier hand gesture.</p>
<p>“Your turn now, bitch meat! This  ought to be good: ten to one it’s about some stupid cartoon she  saw.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I’d like to tell how  Athena and I met each other.” Kate smiled sweetly and focused all  her attention on the Kitsune.</p>
<p>“I’ve always wondered how two  complete opposites could meet and fall in love, especially since your  species are usually enemies.”</p>
<p>“It took a lot of work, patience,  trust, and love…but doesn’t every relationship need those  qualities? Now if you want the details…”</p>
<p>“Go ahead,” Lil gestured. “Naja  and I will just tune you out and have crazy sex over there.” Fuuka  snorted impatiently and waited until the Mun was out of sight. At  least Kate seemed interested; she was turning out to be an unexpected  friend.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>On the planet Onogoro, nestled in  the island of Kyuto, the largest in an archipelago resting in the  heart of Bunkuri ocean, there lived a clan of renowned doctors called  the Fujiwaras, and they were the final authority in medical and  surgical techniques. They combined modern medicine and ancient  herbology to cure ailments that many others deemed impossible, and  their fame was so great that, despite their humble lifestyle, people  from other worlds came to visit them; some even say that this is how  Onogoro broke out of its isolation and officially joined the  planetary union (which is quite untrue, but that’s another matter).  For generations, the Fujiwaras have enjoyed their renown, and have  used it to provide care for any patient that came through their door,  whether they could afford it or not. Eleven years ago, however, they  brought someone into their home that would change the family’s  lives, perhaps even their history.</p>
<p>Fuuka, the only daughter of Hanzui  and Natsume Fujiwara and heir to their legacy, was just fourteen  years old at the time: a simple, innocent girl who was gradually  turning into the woman she was destined to become. Like nearly all  the Fujiwaras, she followed the clan’s medical profession, and had  been identified as a prodigy in the making when she was younger. Like  so many stories, this one has humble origins, an uncomplicated  protagonist, and a matter of interest (and even conflict) that would  be the crux of the tale. Fuuka was beginning her years as a high  school student, and among her studies was the obvious electives of  Biological Health, Pharmacology, General Anatomy, and Ethics. Many of  her weeks were filled with study and hands-on activity, the kind that  allowed her to personally observe and interact with the profession  she was chasing after (for example, being invited to study a routine  operation). They would all shape her into the miraculous physician  she would later become, but the assignment most important to this  particular story was Herb Gathering.</p>
<p>The Fujiwaras had turned herbology  from a science into an art, and they expected Fuuka to know about the  various plants and fungi used in medicine as well as she knew her own  room. She was often asked to venture through Kyuto in search of a  certain leaf, weed, moss, mushroom, stem, bark, or flower, and bring  it back so she could learn from it, and so when the time came for her  to look for a certain lichen, she went out equipped with everything  she needed. For the first quarter-hour, she picked through familiar  brushes and brambles as easily as one strolls around their own  backyard; she knew the lay of the island by heart, and could travel  through just as easily in pitch darkness. Nothing out of the ordinary  popped up in that fifteen minutes, but on the sixteenth, as she  turned a corner and prepared to duck under a small bluff, something  caught her eye that startled her, jerking her back and sending her  belongings to the ground.</p>
<p>It was an unconscious Usagin, a  rabbit-person, mortal enemies of the Kitsune, of which Fuuka was a  member.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The Usagin was beautiful and tall,  taller than Fuuka even while her ears drooped, and her hair was the  color of blood. She was not particularly muscular, but Fuuka got the  feeling that this </p>
<p>creature, if it was conscious, could  rip her apart, and cause plenty of destruction besides. There was a  tattoo on her right shoulder, two simple ovals etched together, 00,  its significance completely meaningless. Fujiwara would’ve ran as  fast as her feeble legs could carry her, out of fear for the enemy of  her kind, if not for the numerous wounds, bruises, and cuts along the  Usagin’s body; she looked like she had been attacked by the rocks  and trees themselves.</p>
<p>Two titanic instincts collided  inside Fuuka’s heart as she stared at the Usagin. One was, of  course, to run, and leave the woman to rot in the wild, a decision  none of her contemporaries would blame her for. The other was to  ignore her xenophobia and to listen to her training, thereby bringing  a dangerous entity into her family’s house. The choice seemed  perfectly clear to her, and so she knelt down and carried the  bleeding Usagin as far as she could. Fuuka was frail, however, and  the woman was tall and quite heavy in spite of her graceful limbs, so  she ran out to find help. She knew that only a Fujiwara would have  compassion for this creature--this helpless, beautiful, wounded  animal who would most likely attack them all once she was healed--and  enlisted the aid of her father and grandfather, who brought a  stretcher and carried the Usagin into their house like she was a  member of the family.</p>
<p>“So what’s wrong with her,  Fuuka?” Hanzui said, more of a test than an honest question. He was  already sterilizing himself and the patient; Fuuka and several other  members of her family followed suit, not a single one pausing to  reconsider the ramifications of their actions.</p>
<p>“Well, these marks along her legs  indicate she must’ve been attacked by a trained pack animal,  because I don’t know of any wild beast whose bite is so precise.  She must’ve been very fast to outrun them…and here’s a few  scratches on her arms. Ah, they were made by brushing against a  Melkruuz bush! Notice the purplish hue of the blood around the cut?”</p>
<p>“Very good. What do you  recommend?” She leaned down and sniffed; the nose of a Fujiwara is  just as important in an operation as their hands and eyes.</p>
<p>“They’re very fresh, so we won’t  have to cut anything off. I’d recommend the Pablynis weed and juice  from a Floraidis to prevent gangrene. I wouldn’t give her a rabies  antidote until she’s conscious. Oh! She was shot, too!”</p>
<p>“It was meant to kill her, not  slow her down,” Hanzui noted. “Look how close it went to her  vital organs. But from the way these scars have formed, this injury  isn’t nearly as new as the others. She must’ve carried this  bullet inside her for a good three, maybe four hours. That’s some  friend you brought home with you, Fuu-chan.” Fuuka blushed and  continued to answer her father’s questions, and in spite of the  situation, she managed to impress him with her knowledge. The  operation lasted into the evening and ended just as the moon was  crawling through the sky--a relatively speedy procedure by any other  account. When it was all over, Fuuka was so exhausted that she had to  be carried into her room, where her mother told her how proud she  was, just as she nodded off.</p>
<p>Several days passed, and while the  operation was a success, Hanzui and Natsume were beginning to grow  concerned. If their furry patient didn’t wake up soon, her muscles  would atrophy and her body would degenerate from lack of nutrition.  Fuuka had been massaging and feeding her </p>
<p>whenever she could spare a minute,  but spent most of her free time watching the redheaded woman,  wondering what she would say once the “sleeping beauty” woke up.  Kitsune and Usagin were enemies, but Fuuka was hoping she could be  friends with this stranger, and wondered if she would ever find out  why she had been lying out there, and what terrible force had driven  her hence. She was just about to leave for a lunch break when the  patient woke up with a violent start, screaming bloody murder as she  swung an invisible weapon. Fuuka was knocked to her feet and stared  at the rabbit-woman in terror before slowly calming down.</p>
<p>“Whew! You scared me!! You don’t  have be afraid of anything, uh, Miss. You’re in a clinic now, on  the island of Kyuto; my family brought you in and took care of you.  Um…is there anything I can get you?” The woman glared at Fuuka as  she tried overcoming the shock of waking up so spontaneously, and  hesitated as she studied her surroundings, and her nurse. She tried  to speak, but her mouth was dry and sore, so she made gestures  instead. Fuuka chastised herself for asking such a silly question,  and came back with water, milk, fruit juice, and several snacks that  were easy to chew and digest. Her face was glowing with renewed hope  and excitement as she placed the tray before her guest, and as  distrustful as the Usagin was, she wouldn’t turn down a free meal.</p>
<p>“My word,” Fuuka whispered as  she watched the redhead wolf everything down. “You poor thing,  you’re starving! Wait right here while I call for some help!  Um…wait, what’s your name, Miss?” The Usagin immediately turned  her head and crossed her arms. She buried herself underneath her  blankets, grunting negatively. Fuuka got the message and decided to  wait another day for introductions.</p>
<p>The Usagin slowly regained her  strength, but nearly ate everything the Fujiwaras had in their stock  that first day. By the time she started pacing herself, Fuuka was  forced to spend what little money she had replacing the groceries,  and was “punished” for bringing such a pig to the house by being  assigned as her personal chef (for which she hugged her parents quite  forcefully). The mysterious Usagin continued to remain mysterious as  young Fujiwara fed, spoke with, cared for, and entertained her, but  Fuuka believed that with persistence, she would open up once she was  ready. No doubt she had suffered through enormous trauma, and was  still coming to terms with her surroundings, her condition, and her  caretakers, which she no doubt saw as a family just waiting for “the  right moment” to spring some fatal surprise. But of course that day  never came.</p>
<p>This process lasted for half a year:  Fuuka came in nearly every day to feed her and share what was going  on in the island, usually talking about her studies, and tried to  bring a little more sunshine into her patient’s life (she still  didn’t know her name, even though the Usagin knew Fuuka’s <em>very</em> well). By this time, the Usagin was allowed to take walks around the  island, and could even swim if she chose, so long as one of the  Fujiwaras was looking after (she thought they were spying on her at  first, but they were really just concerned about her health). She  actually cracked a smile, one day, when Fuuka tripped and fell into a  spectacular mud puddle; she even played a prank on her nurse by  stealing her swimsuit while she was sunbathing. That night, as she  drank milk from a coconut and watched the sun dive below the waves,  the Usagin opened her mouth and addressed Fuuka for the first time:</p>
<p>“You know, this is the nastiest  thing I’ve ever eaten.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“That’s pretty ungrateful of  you!” Fuuka yelped, “Especially since I climbed the tree <em>myself</em> and even drilled a hole in it <em>myself</em>, which wasn’t  easy--HEY!! You talked! By gar, she <em>CAN</em> talk! You’re  actually talking to me!!”</p>
<p>“Only out of ferocious disgust.”  She smirked rather cattily and tossed the coconut to Fuuka, who got  splashed by the milk. The Usagin laughed, loud and beautiful for the  whole island to hear, and Fuuka ended up laughing too, full of joy  and wonder. Once the rabbit-woman calmed down, she bowed and stiffly  muttered out her name:</p>
<p>“It’s Sifr, Athena Sifr.  Hopefully now you can stop pestering me about it.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Athena Sifr!!”  Fuuka exclaimed, almost screaming at the top of her lungs. “My  name’s…well, you already know my name!”</p>
<p>“Fuuka,” she nodded amicably.  “Now that I’ve gone and untied my tongue, it looks like I will  never be able to give you the silent treatment again. It really  would…be ungrateful of me.”</p>
<p>“And you have such a pretty  voice,” Fuuka added sweetly. Athena smiled dimly.</p>
<p>“So do you have anything besides  coconut?”</p>
<p>“Just some chocolates I’ve been  saving.” Fuuka dug into her bag and pulled out a small sack with a  handful of candies, leftovers from her journey to the children’s  ward. Athena bit into one cautiously, but was soon gorging herself,  given new life by the strange confectioneries. Fuuka laughed and took  one before Athena could hog them all. “Slow down or you’ll get  sick! They’re not food, they’re a dessert, for special occasions!  Uh…well, I guess this <em>is</em> a special occasion. Of course,  thanks to you, we’re all out of food, again.”</p>
<p>“Whorry,” Athena mumbled, her  cheeks puffed with candy. Fuuka giggled and ate the last piece.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I’ll just have to  get some more. Actually, the store should still be open by the time I  get there! You can just wait here and, uh…try not to go swimming  anytime soon, okay?” Athena was actually at the shore and had bent  down to clean her hands and face.</p>
<p>“I’m only washing up. That  chocolate of yours is delicious, but messier than I thought. Hmm…hold  on, don’t move.”</p>
<p>“Why?” She had raised her cute  little pink nose in the air, and was sniffing carefully. Fuuka  started sniffing as well, and twitched her ears as a drop of water  splashed her face.</p>
<p>“It’s going to start raining  soon,” Athena warned her. “We should probably head back to your  house. I can wait until another day.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly!” Fuuka  laughed. “It’s only a gentle drizzle. I’ve gone to the grocer’s  and back when it was raining, don’t worry. It’s not far away, so  I’ll be back before you know it. We actually need some other  supplies as well. You go on ahead; I’ll be fine. Trust me, okay?!”  She </p>
<p>winked and skipped off, glowing and  giddy with happiness. Her patient was finally warming up to her,  after so many long weeks, and from the look of things, she would  probably make a great friend. Athena sighed and started walking back  to the Fujiwara house, but something held her up, a force she had  never encountered before. It wasn’t until later that she realized  she cared about Fuuka--she was worried about her, not merely as a  nurse but as a friend as well--and if something should happen to her  in this storm…</p>
<p>“If she gets angry, that’s too  bad,” she resolved. “I’m going to follow her and make sure  she’s safe. I do trust you, Fuuka, whether you know it or not, but  I also care about you as well. I owe you my life.” Arming herself  with a coat, a strong umbrella, and an adamant will, Athena raced off  into the rain, using her sharp senses to track down the person most  precious to her.</p>
<p>What first began as a soft shower  turned into a merciless downpour, complete with high winds, flooding,  thunder, and even lightning. Fuuka wailed as her fur was drenched  (forget about drowned rats: wet Kitsune are much less attractive),  and she slipped and slid against the wet road. She did pause to  admire the lightning, but kept moving on, as fast as she could, more  to reach shelter than to fulfill her promise. Just where did this  storm come from anyway, she wondered. Living in an island had given  her some intuition about weather, and how to read the signs nature  put up. Fuuka wished she had listened to Athena, but it was too late  for that now: she would just have to keep going until she reached the  store, and hope that the manager would let her dry off inside while  the storm passed.</p>
<p>A flash of lightning caught her eye,  and danger notwithstanding, she stopped to gaze at it with childish  glee. That was a deadly decision: the blast struck a tree on a  cliff’s side above her, and it came crashing down and collapsed on  her. The horror of the moment was not so much in the suddenness of  everything--it had all passed in the blink of an eye, making Fuuka’s  heart thud in fear as an adrenaline rush took over--but rather in the  long-term danger of her new dilemma. The tree had not smashed her  limbs or crushed her body, thank god, because the trunk had  completely missed her, and she was now wrapped in its branches. But  the worse she struggled, the more entangled she became, until her leg  found its way underneath a heavy limb, her arm pinned down, and her  head was caught underneath a limb. That was it, then; she was stuck.</p>
<p>There was no way Fuuka could free  herself, and the tree was so heavy that unless the entire Fujiwara  clan arrived immediately, armed with saws and hatchets, there would  be no hope for her escape. The road she was on was beginning to  flood, and the cliff looming over her was beginning to lose its  integrity. Soon, a mudslide would smother everything in its path,  including Fuuka and that damned tree. She panicked and lost focus,  and all the while the rain mocked her, slapping her with torrential  hands, a punishment for her selfless deed. But she was sorry! She  would listen to Athena from now on! She would never take such another  stupid risk! Wasn’t that enough? Couldn’t she be saved? Fuuka  closed her eyes and resigned herself to her fate, weeping out of fear  and regret. She would’ve given anything to see Athena’s face  again…</p>
<p>Clap, clap, went the lightning!  Snap, snap, went the laughter of the tree beneath her--but wait, that  wasn’t right! The tree’s branches were being broken--there went  pieces of shrapnel and debris, flying in horror of some greater  monster. Fuuka managed to twist her face and strain her </p>
<p>eyes through the rain, and watched  in glorious awe as Athena Sifr broke the tree’s branches with her  bare hands. She called to her in a voice that rivaled al the raging  thunders above.</p>
<p>“ATHENA!!”</p>
<p>“Hold still! Don’t try moving  just yet!” Athena worked at a tremendous speed, pulling wooden arms  like they made of cotton, her strength alien and sublime. She had to  burrow through what seemed like hundreds of interwoven bars, racing  against the storm and the inevitable mudslide. Nature’s fury seemed  to retaliate, determined to claim its prize, as part of the cliff  gave way and a deluge of thick, gooey mud surged through. Athena had  lost the luxury of time; she would not be able to reach Fuuka in  time.</p>
<p>“Save yourself!!” Fujiwara  screamed. Athena stared right at her, eyes flaming sapphire, muscles  tense and bloodthirsty, ears pointed straight up, hair standing on  end. Fuuka had never seen anything so terrifyingly wonderful before  in her life--it was like being in the presence of an angel.</p>
<p>“Fuck that,” Athena growled as  she hunched down next to the trunk. “Either we make it out of this  alive together…OR WE DIE TOGETHER!!” And with a roar that  would’ve made a dragon tremble, Athena mustered all of her strength  into a single action, and lifted the trunk off the ground. As  mortified as Fuuka was, she wasted no time and scampered away from  her prison. The ground trembled as Athena dropped the tree, and  together they sought higher ground, clinging to each other the whole  time.</p>
<p>Fuuka was in such a daze over the  whole event that the next thing she remembered was waking up in her  own bed, surrounded by overwhelmingly grateful family members. Mother  cried, father gave thanks, grandfather kissed her…and Athena, who  had been crouching patiently in the corner, looked over at her and  smiled. She waited until Fuuka’s relatives were out of the room  before approaching her new friend, grasping her hand as she caressed  that sweet face she knew so well.</p>
<p>“Guess we’re even now,” Fuuka  sighed. Athena smiled, but said nothing. “Boy, that was some stupid  stunt you pulled, Fuuka. I mean, going out in the middle of a storm  just to buy your new friend Athena some candy? When are you going to  get some sense into that head of yours? Isn’t that what you’re  going to say?” Athena’s lips parted to reveal a happy grin, and  she chuckled softly.</p>
<p>“I really wasn’t going to say  anything. I just wanted to look at you and touch you until I knew you  were really here. That’s all I wanted.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Well, thank you, Athena. Some  day, huh?”</p>
<p>“It’s actually morning now, but  I know what you mean. Actually, I should be the one to thank you,  Fuuka, although I do suppose my…umm, debt is clear now. Do me one  last favor, Fuuka, before I go to get your breakfast. Please don’t  make me worry like that again. I know I’ve…been distant ever  since you brought me in, but the truth is…I actually care about you  a lot. I thought </p>
<p>my heart was going to break when I  first saw you trapped there. Now it’s ready to burst from  happiness.” Precious jewels trickled down Athena’s eyes, tracing  teary lines on her face that Fuuka wiped off. It didn’t take long  for Athena to fulfill the one wish Fuuka had been harboring and  praying for all this time: their first kiss was as perfect as she had  imagined.</p>
<p>“I <em>love</em> you, Fuuka,”  Athena whispered. Fuuka smiled sweetly; she was crying, too.</p>
<p>“I love you too, Athena. I always  have. I promise I’ll be more careful in the future, but can you do  me a favor in exchange?”</p>
<p>“Of course, anything.” The  overjoyed Kitsune giggled.</p>
<p>“Could you call me Fuu-chan from  now on?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>They have been inseparable since.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“That was so sweet!” Kate  exclaimed as Fuuka ended her tale. Fujiwara smiled warmly and yawned.</p>
<p>“Yes, but it took longer than I  thought! I’m ready for bed. Maybe we can continue this tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I guess Naja and Lillie are  still going at it.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, don’t remind me,” Fuuka  groaned as she laid down. “It’s bad enough being stuck here with  them; I don’t need mental imagery distorting everything. Are you  going to stay up?”</p>
<p>“Nah, I’m beat. Mind if I curl  up next to you? It’s getting cold.”</p>
<p>“Sure, make yourself comfortable.”  Fuuka smiled lovingly as Kate snuggled next to her, and draped her  tail around her so the muscular woman would be warm. Athena wouldn’t  mind them being intimate; she and Fuuka trusted and understood one  another. Besides, that bunny-girl was probably doing the same favor  for another member of the crew…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Lillianne knew she had not returned  to her opulent room in the <em>Dauntless</em> since she could feel the  pebbles and blades of grass poking through her blanket, and there was  a star in the sky much </p>
<p>larger and hotter than any of the  ones she could see through her window; it beat down upon her  sadistically, but that was nothing compared to the electric warmth  Naja was giving her as she stirred, and went right to work reviving  them both. Lil giggled and gave Naja a few minutes of playtime before  retaliating.</p>
<p>“Morning, danger girl,” she  purred. Naja grinned and licked Lil’s face with her forked tongue.</p>
<p>“You smell pretty nice for a woman  who hasn’t bathed in a day. You’re soft, too.”</p>
<p>“But not too soft,” she  squealed. They wrestled intimately for about fifteen minutes—kicking,  squealing, groping, and groaning—and ended up falling into an  exhausted, naked pile, glowing with lust as the sun climbed higher,  settling in the middle of the sky. “It’s noon,” Lil estimated.  “We must’ve really been beat.”</p>
<p>“Hell, you were as insatiable as I  was! So tell me something: was I as good as Aseria?”</p>
<p>“You were <em>different</em>,” Lil  smirked. Naja scowled playfully and slapped her belly.</p>
<p>“At least the bitch meat isn’t  here,” she hissed sensually (if you’ve never heard an Elshyrin  hiss sensually, you’re missing out). “You and I would be a lot  happier if she had never come. I mean, Kate’s all right…”</p>
<p>“Let’s not talk about it now,”  Lil groaned happily. “Actually, how about I tell my story? It’s  probably a lot more interesting than whatever <em>she</em> decided to  yap about.” Naja hummed sweetly and straddled Lil, pinning her arms  to the ground as her scaly breasts and russet hair swung.</p>
<p>“Mmm, sounds nice!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em>Long ago, ere the light of  knowledge</em></p>
<p><em>Banished darkness from the East</em></p>
<p><em>Ere Mu, brilliant treasure of  Tellurian pride</em></p>
<p><em>Was cast away by Selene’s bow</em></p>
<p><em>Catapulted ‘cross primordial  heavens</em></p>
<p><em>And laid to rest in a distant sea</em></p>
<p><em>Ere Numenor fell, aye, upon the  world’s dawning</em></p>
<p><em>Did she, Nephilim, pose as  sovereign.</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Blessed with grace, beauty, and  wisdom</em></p>
<p><em>Skilled in all manners of  learning and study</em></p>
<p><em>A terror to foes, and boon to her  kin</em></p>
<p><em>Long was her life, long was her  life.</em></p>
<p><em>Long ago, ere the light of  knowledge</em></p>
<p><em>Brought wisdom from the West</em></p>
<p><em>Nephilim Queen governed the land</em></p>
<p><em>Cold was her marriage bed</em></p>
<p><em>Barren her womb, yet unchaste was  she</em></p>
<p><em>Sephira the Morning Glory</em></p>
<p><em>Pale as a winter’s dawn</em></p>
<p><em>Her blood rivulets of ice</em></p>
<p><em>Her voice as a lark in the bough</em></p>
<p><em>The terror and joy of Mu</em></p>
<p><em>She shared the bed of Nephilim</em></p>
<p><em>Their unholy union discovered,  inspiring</em></p>
<p><em>A war that stole away Promise</em></p>
<p><em>The daughter they had conceived  was lost</em></p>
<p><em>She was taken by fanatics and  heroes</em></p>
<p><em>She was called Promise, erased  from their memory</em></p>
<p><em>And thus did Selene strike Tellus</em></p>
<p><em>Her sacrosanct arrows did sing</em></p>
<p><em>Ne’er do they fail their  mistress</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>And divided the lovers with death</em></p>
<p><em>Their bodies blown to the wind</em></p>
<p><em>And spirits enveloped with chains</em></p>
<p><em>Eldar of Numenor exiled them</em></p>
<p><em>For the crimes of defiling their  honor</em></p>
<p><em>Nephilim to the stars of Deep  Heaven</em></p>
<p><em>Her kingdom carved from the  earth’s womb</em></p>
<p><em>Jewel of Tellus abandoned</em></p>
<p><em>Lost from all knowledge and time!</em></p>
<p><em>Sephira became Selene’s captive</em></p>
<p><em>Thus the goddess was charged with  a task</em></p>
<p><em>To keep the mad demon ensorcelled</em></p>
<p><em>Inside her asylum so cold</em></p>
<p><em>But eons have passed since that  dark age</em></p>
<p><em>And old chains do wither with  time</em></p>
<p><em>Nephilim’s kingdom may linger</em></p>
<p><em>And Sephira may deceive her  lulled warden</em></p>
<p><em>Their spirits honed strong  through the movement of history</em></p>
<p><em>Might yet find a union one day!</em></p>
<p><em>So listen, ye children, of the  ballad of demons</em></p>
<p><em>Let not thy thoughts wander  astray!</em></p>
<p><em>And pray, dear children, to the  heavens above you</em></p>
<p><em>So the mad lovers may never unite</em></p>
<p><em></em></p>
<p><em>Their people forgotten,  worshippers disbanded</em></p>
<p><em>Memories locked up, and rumors  kept silent</em></p>
<p><em>Not for their love were they  exiled</em></p>
<p><em>But rather, desecration of vows</em></p>
<p><em>For Sephira the fair had  forgotten her people</em></p>
<p><em>And Nephilim consumed by lust, by  lust</em></p>
<p><em>Lust of what was not meant to be…</em></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Hey, it sounds like the terrible  two are awake at last,” Kate snorted. She and Fuuka had been hard  at work all morning, gathering food and kindling for the camp, and  had just returned to rest and check up on things. Fuuka’s sharp  ears had picked up the haunting song from far away; it easily  traveled over the empty grassland, and sounded like a ghost from a  time and place long since forgotten. No doubt it was an ancient Mun  ballad describing some heroic or tragic deed.</p>
<p>“It also seems as if Miss Markus  has told her story,” Fuuka agreed. “That just leaves you, Miss  Shepherd.” Kate frowned sourly.</p>
<p>“<em>Oh</em>. I almost forgot. Um,  could I take, like, a rain check? I’m sort of running dry on  creative juices.”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t matter,” Fuuka  cackled. “We all bared our souls…sort of…so it’s only fair  that you follow up! Come on, you must’ve led an interesting life.  Why don’t you tell us about that tattoo?”</p>
<p>“This one?” Kate pulled her  shoulder strap back to reveal a portrait of a nude woman riding a  missile, armed with Uzis. Her face turned red as the memories came  back to her. “Actually, that’s a pretty unusual tale. It’s,  uh…sort of my coming-out story.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?” Fuuka  asked naively. Kate decided that the best way to explain it would be  to let her story speak for her, and began bashfully.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>You already know that I’ve spent  all my life in Utopia, a Heavy-G world that’s also regarded as one  of the worst places to live. There are cities all across the galaxy  that have infamous reputations, and on a higher level, there are  countries that are rotten and corrupt to their core. Sometimes,  you’ll even see an entire continent go under--but I don’t think  you’ll ever see a whole planet devoting itself to filth. Outsiders  have called Utopia ‘the anus of the galaxy’, </p>
<p>among other colorful monikers, and I  say it deserves them all. But I’m getting off track. As soon as I  managed to scrounge up enough gold, I took the first commercial  flight out of there and never looked back.</p>
<p>The story of how I got my tattoo  begins on my first rest-stop. As Shana or Yenae might tell you, I  took the ship from the Rennai system all the way to Strategos, but I  had one layover before that--the world where I got this work of art  etched into my skin, where I first sampled the pleasures of sex, and  where I confirmed my attractions to other women. Having just spent my  last coin on the long one-way passage, I was desperate for money, and  so gnawingly hungry that I was just about to steal something and risk  everything I had worked for, when I was stopped by a person who would  later become my first lover. Her name was Sarishaun, and she was an  artist.</p>
<p>Now <em>she</em> was a lady! She  treated me to dinner and even gave me some money to tide me over, but  in exchange, she begged me to model for her. I was flattered, of  course, but also a little embarrassed. I mean, I’m not hideous, but  I’m not exactly breathtaking, either. She told me it didn’t  matter--<em>she</em> thought I was beautiful, and that seemed good  enough to lure me in. As she drove me to her temporary studio--she  traveled all over the place in search of models for her  work--Sarishaun told me that she was a body artist, that she painted  bare skin and presented the living work of art in her gallery, or  whenever a client favored that unorthodox style. I was taken aback,  but far be it from me to keep a closed mind. She was a beautiful,  passionate woman; I was beginning to feel excited as my fantasies  grew.</p>
<p>Anyway, to make a long story  shorter, she painted this very image all over my chest. I had to take  my shirt and bra off--it was a little uncomfortable at first, but  Sarishaun was very professional about everything. I stood there  watching as she gradually transformed me, chatting with her as she  worked her magic. My god, Fuuka, it was heavenly. After I posed for a  few photos, she told me I could take a shower, and I asked her if she  wanted to join me. This is…sort of the part where you have to use  your imagination! Anyway, I got to keep the copies and before I  boarded my next flight, I went into a tattoo parlor and asked the  woman working there to impose that image on my shoulder. It’s  always been my permanent reminder of that magical day, when I was  given a new life with so many possibilities.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“And that makes four,” Kate  concluded nostalgically, “although I think yours was best.”</p>
<p>“It was certainly the longest!”  Fuuka jested. As they shared a quiet smile, Naja and Lil finally  emerged from the barrier they had erected to keep the two groups  private, apparently finished with their lovemaking.</p>
<p>“That was four, all right,” Lil  said. “And now, I think it’s time we resume our search. We’ve  wasted enough time telling stories.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I kept mine so  short,” Naja snickered. “If I wanted to, I could’ve told a  prize-winning whopper that would’ve made all yours look like  nursery rhymes! And to think, you all call ME inconsiderate! Hurry  up, bitch meat! Get the lead out, Shepherd! Daylight’s wasting!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes, boss,” she grunted  bitterly. She looked over at Fuuka, her unlikely new friend, and  reached out to support her as they moved out of the safety of their  camp into a harsh, unforgiving environment.</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Naja: SOMEONE PLEASE COME RESCUE US!  I’M TRAPPED IN MY OWN PERSONAL HELL!!</p>
<p>Lil: Gee, really? This is your idea  of Hell? I always pictured there’d be more cats.</p>
<p>Naja: sniffling Well…now that I  think about it…I suppose it could be worse. I could be married to  that caveman fiancé of mine!</p>
<p>Lil: That’s the spirit! Just keep  your hopes up! In the meantime, I’m going to start building a  weapon that will completely obliterate the FILTHY DEVIL SLUT who’s  shacking up with my Aseria!!</p>
<p>Naja: Yee! You’re so cool, Lil! I  wish I was arranged to marry YOU. pout</p>
<p>Fuuka: Eww, and the mind-raping  continues…</p>
<p>Kate: At least they have the decency  to do it in private. But anyway, we’re getting off topic. What’s  the next chapter about, doc?</p>
<p>Fuuka: Oh, I almost forgot! Yes, it  seems my darling Athena will take center stage in the next chapter!  You heard my side of our first encounter--now you’ll hear hers!  It’s all in the next astounding and completely credible chapter,  “Ballad of Angels: her bloody trail”.</p>
<p>Kate: Umm, how can I hear it if  we’re separated like this?</p>
<p>Fuuka: ………Good point. PLEASE  COME RESCUE US, ATHENA!!</p>
<p>Kate: Uh, yeah, I’ll just go curl  up in the corner over there…</p>
