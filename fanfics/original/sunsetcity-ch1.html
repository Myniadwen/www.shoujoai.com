<pre>Return to Sunset City 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Holy cow! This place sure can change in three years.&quot;

Ryo Asagawa&#39;s deep blue eyes widened as he marvelled at Sunset City for 
the time in three years. As he walked through the automatic doors 
leading out of Whiteland Train Station, he couldn&#39;t hold back the shock 
in his mind. The place looks so different from his memories of it. Where 
there were once slum buildings and cheap stalls by the open road, there 
were now tall and powerful skyscrapers climbing into the sky. The 
pavements seemed so much cleaner, the roads were far clearer, and it 
might have been Ryo&#39;s imagination, but streets even smelt fresher 

&quot;Damn,&quot; Ryo said to himself, walking down the clear pavement with his 
suitcase in hand. &quot;Sunset City sure is different from the last time I 
saw it. I wonder how all this started...?&quot;

It was unimaginable to Ryo. He had been living here most of his life and 
through that time he had come to associate two words to this town. 
Dangerous and Lawless. In his day, these streets weren&#39;t nearly as clean 
or safe for that matter. Sunset City had been a filthy stinking hole 
full of criminals, gangs and hooligans. Those who could fight were the 
best off, but when it really came down to it, nobody was at all safe. 
With a mayor that was too afraid to do anything about it, Ryo was sure 
that Sunset City would have looked even worse by the time he got back. 
Apparently, that was not the case. Because urban renewal had obviously 
been Sunset City&#39;s main agenda, but for how long? 

Well, regardless of that, Ryo&#39;s amazement could wait. His first issue 
was to track down his friends, Kayde, Yun-Yun (especially Yun-Yun, girls 
that hot don&#39;t come around often) and Jahn. It had been a while since 
Ryo left Sunset City, at least three years, so he hadn&#39;t really been in 
touch much. Not that it would have mattered. Communications between 
Sunset City and the outside world had been blocked up until two months 
ago. The reason behind this was to slow down the flow of illegal 
immigrants into the town. Now that he was able to reach the city again, 
Ryo decided that a visit in person was in order. But he still had no 
idea if he was staying or not. Still, the main issue was finding his 
friends. 

Ryo could remember distinctly that Yun-Yun had sent him a little letter 
about a month ago, saying that she had started working part-time at the 
liquor bar that Jahn owned Thankfully, that bar (Diamond Star) was not 
too far from Whiteland station. Catching up with Kayde would not be as 
easy, but in all hopes, Yun-Yun or Jahn probably knew what he was doing 
with himself. The young brunette ran a hand through his wavy black hair 
and picked up his pace, turning around a corner of a nearby building He 
may have been gone a while, and Sunset City may have changed, but Ryo 
still knew his way around. The layout had not changed much, and he knew 
that this path led to a back street. This back street when straight down 
from Whiteland road into the Brookwood district. Jahn had opened his bar 
there at least eight or so years ago, after the previous one was burned 
to the ground. 

&#39;Man,&#39; Ryo thought. &#39;I remember the days when Kayde, Yun-Yun and me all 
used to hang out at Jahn&#39;s bar. Of course he was never happy about 
having a trio of barely-legals in his bar, but he always cut us some 
slack. I hope I can score some free drinks off of him this time, since 
I&#39;m not a kid anymore.&#39;

Ryo continued to hammer over his thoughts, walking down the concealed 
back street leading towards Brookwood, trekking over a small distance. 
Though it took about ten minutes longer than Ryo remembered it taking, 
Ryo finally came into the Brookwood district. And, just as he thought it 
would be, Jahn&#39;s bar stood proudly amongst the other shops and buildings 
that surrounded it. Ryo loved the sense of nostalgia he felt when he 
looked upon one of his old hangouts. Jahn&#39;s bar, Diamond Star,  looked 
almost exactly the same, except the windows were unbroken and there was 
no graffiti on the surrounding walls. But instead of just standing 
there, the young man made his choice and began to stride across the 
road, toward Diamond Star Ryo smiled as he pushed the revolving 
glass-paned door open, and made his way inside. He instantly froze when 
he saw what was taking place inside. 

Two thugs, dressed up in punk-clothes and sporting some Mohawks, stood 
in front of the counter They were armed with 8-inch knives, and their 
greedy eyes observed the cash register Behind the bar was, just as Ryo 
had hoped, Jahn, dressed up in his trademark grey suit watching the two 
thugs with contempt. 

One of them grinned like a madman. &quot;Hey dude! I want every note and 
every coin in that cash register now, okay!? Do it fast or I&#39;ll have to 
ram this cute little knife into your eye!&quot;

&quot;You better do what he says!&quot; The fellow thug added, &quot;This guy would 
slit his own mother&#39;s throat if he wanted to!&quot;

Jahn&#39;s dark brown eyes rolled. &quot;You buffoons really think that 
intimidates me?&quot;

&quot;Bastard!&quot; The first thug yelled. &quot;This&#39;ll teach you to mouth off to 
me!&quot;

In an instant, the ruffian twirled his knife in his hand and clutched at 
it tightly, then began to thrust at Jahn. The English barkeep didn&#39;t 
move a muscle, but then he didn&#39;t need to. A second hand flashed out 
from nowhere, grabbing thug&#39;s armed hand in a crushing grip. It was Ryo, 
with a confident and beaming smile along his lips. The thug cried out as 
Ryo&#39;s powerful fingers pressed into his hand, but Ryo didn&#39;t stop until 
he dropped the knife. 

As soon as the metal blade hit the floor, Ryo dragged in the thug and 
branched out his leg The thug&#39;s head snapped back with a bang as he was 
kicked dead centre, instantly inflicting a black eye that was going to 
have one hell of a sting tomorrow This punk stumbled backwards, while 
his cohort looked on in surprise. That kick was so fast that he barely 
saw it land!

&quot;W-Whoa!&quot; The standing thug said, dumbstruck. &quot;I thought that only the 
boss could attack like that!&quot;

Ryo smiled at that man. &quot;Tell your &#39;boss&#39; this. Anyone who interferes 
with Diamond Star or its owner will have to answer to me! Ryo Asagawa!&quot;

The thug that had been downed by Ryo&#39;s single kick looked up with awe. 
Did he just say... Asagawa? There was no need to question it though. 
Before the two even knew what they were doing, they turned tail and ran, 
dashing out through the door and back into the sunny streets. Ryo 
lowered his fists and smiled once more, turning back to the counter. 
Behind the counter, was Jahn, with a hugely surprised look on his face.

&quot;Ryo?&quot; He said with strain, his English accent a familiar sound to the 
man in question. &quot;Is that really you?&quot;

Ryo nodded &quot;Yup! What&#39;s up, Jahn? How long has it been?&quot;

&quot;Three years, kid!&quot; Jahn joked. &quot;Grab a stool!&quot;

That was what Ryo wanted to hear. The young man walked over to the side 
of the room, beside one of the many rounded tables that were around. He 
pulled down one of the stools then walked back over to the front 
counter. There were no other customers, probably because it was still 
fairly early, which made this situation even easier to get around. Ryo 
pressed the stool into the ground and hopped on it, while Jahn walked 
over to the shelf holding so many drinks and liquors. 

&quot;What&#39;ll it be?&quot; Jahn asked.

Ryo grinned &quot;Aren&#39;t you gonna ask me for some ID?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get smart, Ryo Asagawa.&quot; Jahn said smiling. &quot;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re 
looking for a taste of  the old Blue Moon. You used to love it back in 
the old days.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll do.&quot; While Jahn took out the bottle of Blue Moon and began 
pouring it into the glass, Ryo looked around the place once more. It had 
been refurbished that was for sure, but it still felt like it had done 
three years ago. &quot;So Jahn. Is that the first time you&#39;ve come up against 
those guys?&quot;

Jahn shook his head. &quot;No. Sunset City might have been jazzed up 
slightly, but it is still dangerous here. And as much as I hate having 
to fight again, my run ins with the Zazubaza Gang have warranted a 
return of my fists. I can usually handle these situations though.&quot;

&quot;The Zazubaza Gang?&quot; Ryo questioned. &quot;They&#39;re still active?&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot; Jahn replied. &quot;Like I said, lots of things have changed but some 
are still the same as always. I don&#39;t really know much about them but I 
hear that the police aren&#39;t able to keep up with their activities But 
the police are just as useless now as there were before.&quot;

Ryo nodded in thanks as Jahn handed him a glass of Blue Moon. &quot;Thanks. 
So, what about Kayde and Yun-Yun? Are they around? I was hoping to see 
them now.&quot;

&quot;Yun-Yun is working here, part time.&quot; Jahn answered. &quot;She&#39;s not coming 
in till a bit later for her midday shift. You&#39;re welcome to wait, but if 
you&#39;d like to see her now, you should go up to the Mao Kung Dojo. She 
and her grandfather still own it and are still training students&quot;

&quot;What about Kayde?&quot;

Jahn  rested his elbows on the bar counter. &quot;Kayde? I haven&#39;t seen much 
of him lately. He comes in every once in a while to grab a drink and 
chat with Yun-Yun, but aside from that I haven&#39;t seen hide nor hair of 
him. That&#39;s just like Americans. Always drifting, never rooted. But I 
suppose I can&#39;t talk. Sunset City&#39;s populous is cut from so many moulds. 
American, Chinese, English, Japanese, Russian, Mexican, Irish, African, 
French. You name it, we got it.&quot;

&quot;I gotcha. Well, at least both of them are still around.&quot;

**********

&quot;Yah! Tah! Wah!&quot;

Yun-Yun pounded on the heavy bag in front of her like it was her life. 
Each one of her beautifully aimed kicks and punches slammed into the 
thick training tool, creating loud thumping noises that echoed around 
the training room of the Mao Kung Dojo. It was hard to believe that her 
grandfather, Shun son Lee, had allowed this to be added to the training 
room, because usually he frowned on such things. All the same, Shun did 
pay for it with the money earned through training students, and because 
of that Yun-Yun was free to pound on this new heavy bag as much as she 
wanted. It helped her training, but more importantly, it helped her blow 
off steam.

With one last kick, Yun-Yun ended her assault on the heavy bag. She took 
a deep breath and sighed, when she looked down at her clothes. She was 
just wearing a sweatshirt and jeans for the simple fun of it, but 
Yun-Yun had actually sweated all over it She began to wonder how long 
she was practicing for, and looked up to the clock on the left wall. 
Apparently she had been working out for like two and a half hours But 
Yun-Yun just let it roll off her back. It took its toll on her, but the 
practice was worth it. Despite the urban renewal, Sunset City was still 
never really safe All you had to do was look out the window of the dojo 
to see this. The walls that had been freshly painted were now starting 
to gather more graffiti. One of the windows in the other training room 
had been smashed in just yesterday too. Sunset City may have been 
spruced up, but deep down it was the same as it had always been And it 
was only a matter of time before it sunk back into the harshness that it 
had sprung up from. Because of this, it was absolutely essential that 
Yun-Yun was at the peak of her form. 

Yun-Yun wiped her brow free of the sweat she had collected in her 
previous workout, and grabbed a towel from a nearby rack. The woman 
placed her face inside the cooling towel, and rubbed, soaking up the 
sweat she had produced. While she did that, a door opened at the back of 
the training room. It swung open to reveal a man, tall and fairly built. 
His clothing was typically Chinese, his slightly greying black hair tied 
into a ponytail and thrown over his shoulder. Though this man looked to 
be about 45-years of age, he was actually around his 60&#39;s. 

Yun-Yun turned around when she heard footsteps. &quot;Huh? Grandfather?&quot;
 
Shun son Lee smiled. &quot;Still hard at work I see.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Yun-Yun answered. &quot;I have to keep in shape. And plus I still 
haven&#39;t mastered all the techniques that you have taught me yet&quot;

Shun nodded &quot;It will come in time. I have faith that you will fully 
understand the depths of our style of fighting. But for now you just 
make sure that your training stays as it is.&quot;

&quot;Sure, grandfather. I&#39;ll keep trying.&quot; Yun-Yun added. &quot;But I better get 
to work. Jahn will kill me if I&#39;m late again. Plus, I want to get there 
before any of the Zazubaza gang can cause anymore problems.&quot;
