<h1>All Girls School (part 53 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch52.html">Back to Part 52</a><pre>Erica was startled from her nap by the sound of a flushing commode. She 
never remembered falling asleep, but perhaps a lack of activity combined 
with the warmth of the air-conditioned house (not to mention how soft 
the couch was) had made her drowsy. She groaned stiffly, and rubbed her 
eyes. Jocelyn came out of the bathroom and padded barefoot towards the 
den.

&quot;Mom home yet?&quot; she asked. Erica groaned no. &quot;What&#39;s the matter, fall 
asleep?&quot;

&quot;I think I did,&quot; she said with a yawn. &quot;Ho, I didn&#39;t know I was so 
tired. What time is it?&quot;

&quot;Nearly five,&quot; said Jocelyn. She helped Erica up off the couch, 
entwining their fingers in a strong, helpful grip&#151;not meant to be sexual 
or even intimate, but Erica couldn&#39;t help but feel the spark. The words 
I&#39;m in love with you taunted her as she followed her friend into the 
kitchen. As an afterthought, Jocelyn mentioned, &quot;Mom should be home 
anytime with supper. Help me set up, would you?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; She wasn&#39;t sure whether Joss was being her usual friendly self 
or if she was trying to cope with Erica&#39;s feelings in a distant, polite 
manner. Either way, the girls didn&#39;t say too much to each other as they 
set plates, filled cups, took out napkins, and cleared the table. Erica 
was shy and unsure of herself, but she knew she&#39;d have to be the one to 
get the ball rolling.

&quot;Hey, Joss? Um, what do you make of what I said to you earlier?&quot;

&quot;You mean about&#151;oh.&quot; She didn&#39;t answer, and resumed setting the table, 
picking out forks and knives for three. She had to contemplate very 
deeply about that, it seemed; otherwise she would&#39;ve answered.

&quot;I mean... Joss... um, hello? Heh. Oh, sorry, I&#39;m silly.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Um... never mind. I just... well... maybe it was just a silly crush. 
You know, how friends sometimes become attracted to each other...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she answered. &quot;Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve had many friends I&#39;ve had feelings 
for.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Well, she thought to herself, so much for that. Now Jocelyn will 
think I&#39;m weird for the rest of my life. First Amina, now her. Why do I 
always go for the straight girls?

&quot;Erica?&quot; She was pulled out of her thoughts.

&quot;Um, yes?&quot; Jocelyn slowly walked over, took both her friend&#39;s hands, and 
kissed her lightly on her lips.

&quot;We&#39;ll talk after supper,&quot; she promised, and that was that.
The Protest

&quot;Part Four: Standing in the Cold&quot;

It was day seven, and everyone had been asked to come an hour early so 
they could have a chance to perform their final march. Naturally, 
speeches and ceremonies would take place, but everyone was wondering 
what would happen once the girls had circled the building and blasted 
their instruments. A few people honestly thought the school would 
collapse. Those who were more realistic believed that nothing would 
happen, that the girls would make their point, get on the news, and 
return to class.

Neither Alexandra Blair nor Corona Marcos really cared about any of 
that. They were so-so about the war and the draft; their own personal 
problems were far greater and more severe. But they had each other, 
particularly on that cold November day, and had huddled together on a 
blanket they had spread over the grass so they wouldn&#39;t get wet. Corona 
had Blair by the waist, arms wrapped around her intimately in spite of 
still &quot;just dating&quot;; it was more a means of staying warm than expressing 
romance.

&quot;What a day,&quot; sighed Corona, her breath turning into a ghost. &quot;Or for 
that matter, what a week.&quot; She checked her watch again and noted that 
they still had ten minutes to go before everyone started to circle 
around the school. She hugged Alex closer. &quot;This isn&#39;t so bad.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; agreed her companion. She covered Corona&#39;s hands and fingers with 
her palm, letting the limited heat between them increase. Marcos moved 
her hands just enough so that they could entwine with Alex&#39;s and push 
the envelope from friendly hugging to subtle intimacy. Most of the other 
girls were holding each other as well, whether outdoors or in their 
cars, and some did much more than holding. Alex didn&#39;t want to rush 
things with Corona, like she had with Ivory, Rai, and Ana. She still 
couldn&#39;t believe she was capable of being so slutty.

&quot;Let&#39;s talk about something while we&#39;re waiting,&quot; she suggested. Corona 
agreed and asked what. &quot;Well, each other, I guess. I mean, if we&#39;re 
dating, we may as well.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. You wanna go first?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot;

And so Alex told Corona about herself: about her ruined home life, her 
career as a self-destructive raver, her infamy, how close she had came 
to killing herself so many times, and how her relationship with Ivory 
had soured. She spoke of how horrible she had been, and how utterly 
close she came to giving up everything&#151;but then, slowly, as more and 
more people showed her support, she had climbed out of the deep chasm, 
towards the light.

&quot;I&#39;m still climbing, though,&quot; she added. &quot;I&#39;ve come a long way, and I&#39;m 
not nearly as nasty or miserable as I used to be, but plenty enough. 
That&#39;s the way things are.&quot; She settled back into Corona&#39;s embrace, 
letting the other girl comb through her growing purple hair. Corona 
couldn&#39;t say anything for awhile; she had absorbed nearly ten years of 
pain in a matter of a few minutes. Of course, it answered a whole lot of 
questions, and she began to understand Alex in a better way. Perhaps, 
with a little bit of time, patience, and love, she could help heal the 
broken woman, and maybe even herself.

&quot;Now it&#39;s your turn,&quot; said Blair. Corona took a deep breath.

&quot;All right. It&#39;s not a happy story, but I guess you&#39;re used to that sort 
of thing. In a way we&#39;re very similar, you and I.&quot; She gathered her 
courage and quickly kissed Alex&#39;s ear, making her shiver just a bit. She 
curled the other girl&#39;s long hair in a tight tail, brushed it aside and 
began kissing the nape of her neck, which had rarely felt the joy of 
nakedness, let alone the touch of a loving kiss. Alex gasped with a 
pleasure she&#39;d never felt before, and secretly wished that Corona would 
turn her around and start kissing her elsewhere. But she stopped pecking 
and started talking.

&quot;A constant battle rages in my head,&quot; she breathed, &quot;between what people 
say is right and what I think is right. I don&#39;t always know what they 
are; I get them mixed up a lot. Also, I&#39;ve found that in my life, no 
matter who I meet, I have an odd affect on them. I can heal their hurts, 
I can mend their inner wounds, I can quiet their demons and make them 
feel better. The downside is that I myself end up feeling more 
miserable. It&#39;s like I&#39;m a mood vacuum, and once I suck away another 
person&#39;s dirt, it&#39;s like it clings to me.&quot;

&quot;Do you feel that way around me?&quot; asked Alex quietly. Corona smiled.

&quot;Strangely, no. Do I ever make you feel any better?&quot; She nodded stiffly.

&quot;All the time.&quot; Now that was a mystery, but Marcos continued.

&quot;You could say I&#39;m a bit like a cross between you and Kula. I really 
hate people who are stuck-up or better off; it&#39;s like they laugh when 
other people are miserable, and that sets me off. I always wish those 
people would suffer as I&#39;ve suffered, so they would know. Every time I 
see some ignorant person, I can&#39;t help but chuckle with glee at the 
thought of how they would conduct themselves in, say, a third world 
country. Or if the world comes to its end and God decides to open up His 
cans of whoop-ass on our sorry population. I don&#39;t think any of that&#39;s 
necessary, though.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; asked Blair, treasuring the feeling of Corona&#39;s fingernails 
raking across her head. She kissed Alex&#39;s neck on the side before 
answering.

&quot;People are stupid and destructive. We don&#39;t need an apocalypse, because 
people will eventually wipe themselves out.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. So you&#39;re a church girl, then, or were?&quot;

&quot;I was Catholic, but now I&#39;m an atheist. I can&#39;t understand how such a 
pathetic race as Man could come from any god.&quot;

&quot;I know, tell me about it. If there is a god, I say that he, or she, or 
it&#151;whatever&#151;is pretty cruel and fucking stupid. Masochistic, lying, 
cheating, swindling; you name it, all the bad names in the book. 
Fuck-head.&quot; Corona chuckled softly and squeezed Alex&#39;s hands. Their 
intimacy was growing deep; their combined body heat made them warm. Alex 
wanted nothing more than to relax in the other woman&#39;s arms, and maybe 
kiss her.

I just wish I had the guts to kiss her.

I wish Alex would kiss me.

&quot;My parents are...&quot; she began, but stopped herself as the procession 
started. Both girls stood and watched as the student body and their 
supporters began forming a ring around the school, picket signs and 
banners giving color to the mass. &quot;Well, it&#39;s started.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s go.&quot; Alex and Corona took each other&#39;s hands, and held 
tight throughout the entire march.

&quot;On the seventh day, they got up at daybreak and marched around the city 
in the same manner, except that on that day they circled the city seven 
times. The seventh time around, when the priests sounded the trumpet 
blast, Joshua commanded the people, &#39;Shout! For the Lord has given you 
the city!&#39;&quot; --Joshua 6:15-16

&quot;You were saying?&quot; said Alex as she and her companion marched. Corona 
looked down towards the grass as she spoke.

&quot;My parents are... not a big part of my life, they never were. Dad died 
in a car wreck when I was eight, and mom was sent to an asylum soon 
afterwards. I barely see her; she barely recognizes me.&quot;

&quot;Hmph, I know what that&#39;s like.&quot;

&quot;I have an older brother, Alonso, who&#39;s a pro lifeguard and swimming 
instructor. I myself was born in Arizona, though my family came from 
Mexico City. I don&#39;t speak a drop of Spanish, unless you count the words 
on my bracelet.&quot; Corona then held up the band for Alex to see, and she 
squinted to read the engraving.

&quot;&#39;Pueda estra nina sea la corona de luz usado por Nuestro Senor&#39;. What&#39;s 
it mean?&quot;

&quot;I know the whole thing by heart: &#39;May this child be the crown of light 
worn by Our Lord&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Sounds nice. So is that where you got your name?&quot;

&quot;I guess. Corona means &#39;crown of light&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s also a pretty good beer.&quot; The two girls laughed, and 
together they circled the school once. Six more laps were left to go; 
the band was already striking up a tune.

&quot;So,&quot; said Alex, stepping across the grass, &quot;crown of light, huh? And I 
said I was climbing out of my chasm looking for the light. Maybe you&#39;re 
what I need.&quot; She looked over and gave Corona a smile, which was 
returned shyly. Their hands squeezed tighter as they resumed the walk.

Victoria helped push June&#39;s wheelchair as they made the first lap 
around. The band was already playing something, but June had kept her 
instrument silent. She put it to her mouth impulsively, and earned a few 
smiles by flawlessly playing &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot;. Victoria smiled the most, 
and even hoisted a large American flag up. They were joined by 
spotlight-hogging Alisha, who had carried a small drum with her. A white 
bandanna had been hastily wrapped around her head, a spot of it showing 
up as crimson. The three girls looked like true Revolutionary soldiers, 
and got more merry laughs and cheers from everyone.

Hand in hand, Avelina and Ethan followed close behind. Avelina started 
to sing to herself, having an elementary grasp of patriotic American 
lyrics, and was soon joined by her boyfriend. The song changed to 
&quot;Dixieland&quot;, symbolizing that both the Yankee North and the Dixie South 
of the country would be united in this cause regardless, and the band 
struck up &quot;Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. Everyone now cheered, sang, or 
chanted, and waved their signs all the prouder.

During the second lap, the band broke out in &quot;Rule Britannia&quot; to honor 
the English students there, and each lap was followed by a song from 
many of the countries the girls came from, such as Brazil, India, 
Ireland, Mexico, China, Germany, Japan, France, Russia, Sweden, Canada, 
the Middle East, Finland, the Philippines, Holland, and many more. It 
took four more laps to do them all.

Corona had revealed everything she was comfortable with by the fifth 
lap. Whenever she could get a word in, she talked about her home life, 
her troubles, and how a near-suicide had forced her brother to sell 
their only car. She was now working part-time to help pay off the debt, 
but her job only added to the stress and misery she was already going 
through. Alex looked grimly impressed as she listened; it seemed she 
really did have a whole lot in common with Corona. And this girl was 
supposed to be her light? It was more like two people trying to lead 
each other through a dark cave.

When the girls had walked around the school six times, a news van 
finally arrived at the scene. Reporters came and set up their equipment, 
distracting some of the girls. Others went to find any teachers who were 
free, and Marbel stepped out to say hello. Of course, the conversation 
was private, but it was assumed they were negotiating television time 
and coverage. The girls would later learn that a few were going to be 
interviewed just as soon as the seventh lap was completed. For now, the 
camera trained on them, swallowing footage. A few couldn&#39;t help but act 
hammy, but some showed restraint and resumed their protest.

At last the girls started the seventh and final lap around the school, 
and for this, everyone was quiet. When at last they stopped, the band 
blared and everyone shouted and cheered, raising their banners, flags, 
signs, hands, and anything else they had. Of course, the school did not 
collapse, nor did it even break, not one chip off the brick or wood. A 
few expressed disappointment, but most figured they had gotten their 
point across, powerfully and peacefully.

Alex and Corona smiled and embraced each other as the ring broke and the 
crowd dispersed. A few girls among them were pulled out for interviews 
with the news, but most of them went inside the school (finding it no 
different than before) while others got in their cars and headed to 
their home, or job, or their own school. Corona and Alex continued their 
hug longer than necessary, but it was the first one they had shared 
mutually, so they had an excuse.

What are you waiting for, dummy? Kiss her!

Will Alex kiss me? I hope she does.

Kiss her, stupid! You know you want to!

I might just have to do it myself. Oh, I hope she feels the same.

Kiss her, idiot!

Kiss me, idiot! They released each other. Words could not be said; they 
weren&#39;t needed. The protest was now the last thing on their minds; they 
were now only focused on each other, two lost souls drowning in 
darkness, two lost souls providing an unlikely source of light for each 
other. Alexandra took Corona&#39;s face in her hands and lifted it up 
slightly. She brushed a wet tear away, not knowing why the other girl 
was crying. Happiness, fear, sadness, maybe for no reason at all? She 
wanted to, she wanted to, she wanted so badly to, to...

Alex pressed her forehead against Corona&#39;s, holding the girl&#39;s head in 
her palms. Corona opened her mouth, gasping a tiny sliver of cold 
November air, and rubbed her nose against Alex&#39;s. Her heart was thudding 
restlessly. She was shaking from cold and anxiety. She touched Alex&#39;s 
hair with her fingers and smoothed it out softly. If ever there had been 
a world, it was beyond them; they were now literally lost in each 
other&#39;s eyes, each so brown and beautiful, mixed with pain and passion, 
that they mirrored each other almost perfectly.

Alexandra Blair leaned down slightly, closed her eyes, and put her mouth 
on Corona&#39;s lips.

Corona Marcos embraced Alexandra Blair and felt, for the first time in 
ages, restored and healed beyond her own comprehension.

They were five minutes late for class.</pre>
