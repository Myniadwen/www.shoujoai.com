room since that incident with the alcohol. Thanks to that, I spent every ni

at the dark ceiling, most of the times unable to sleep until it was past

midnight. Well, unfortunate as it might seem, it did give me a chance to

reflect on my situation without my girlfriend lying in my arm and tangling 
my

wits. I do realize that things wouldn’t stay this way forever, and that s
ooner

or later, I would have to deal with Kugimiya Karasu who, after learning of

Koto-chan’s survival the day following her return to <i>Furisame Jinja</i

repealed the last command he gave me and ordered me to steal <i>Sennen no I

that I must find some way to kill the man to protect the secret of my ident

or tell Koto-chan the whole truth. The first one would lead to certain deat

crow demon was too powerful and too smart for a half-breed like me. The sec

well… I can’t say that it won’t get me killed… but honestly, the fe

would be the last thing I had on my mind.<o:p></o:p></p>

text-indent:.5in'>As if sleeping on my own wasn’t enough, other misfortun
es

just <i>had</i> to befall me. It started with a minor one, which happened i
n

the third week into the second month after New Year, when my Koto-chan saw 
me

washing the bloodstained handkerchief. She repeated the question she had as
ked

on the very day of her return. Where, when, and how did I get the piece of

cloth she lost in the ruined town of Kiyozumi. I never expected her to, so 
when

she did, all I felt was panic and fright. I stared at her for a good five

minutes before I managed to answer that Sadamoto Shun'ichi’s spies had br
ought

it back for me. My girlfriend didn’t buy that, but for some reason she dr
opped

the question and acted as though she never asked. Before I could heave a si
gh

of relief, a second question came. Why did I act so coldly toward after she

performed the exorcism on little Nakayama Kohaku? This one I didn’t find 
an

answer for no matter how hard I searched.<o:p></o:p></p>

text-indent:.5in'>Perhaps the raven-haired girl sensed my desperation to co
me

up with something to tell her and my reluctance to tell the truth, for she 
told

me in the end that I shouldn’t worry about it anymore, that right then, s
he was

only glad that I had confessed to her and made her the luckiest girl in the

world. She never asked about it ever again… but it wounded me dearly to b
e

reminded that I <i>was</i>, and <i>am</i> still keeping all sorts of secret
s

from the one girl I love. The better she treated me, the more she showed th
at she

loved me, the worse I felt. Lately, before she went away on her trip that i
s,

every kiss she gave me and every touch she made on my face hurt me the way 
a

needle would.<o:p></o:p></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>The second misfortune that I suffered from came from no o
ne

but Kugimiya Karasu himself. It was just two weeks ago, actually, on the da
y

following my Koto-chan’s departure from <i>Furisame Jinja</i> to pick up 
an

envoy of the <i>Grand Shrine of Ise</i> from the port at the southern end o
f

the island. What did an envoy from <i>Ise</i> came here for, Nikki-chan? Oh
,

I’m sorry, I thought I already told you that. Guess I’ll need to re-rea
d what I

had written from times to times.<o:p></o:p></p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>Well, it’s like this, Nikki-chan. Remember the <i>Ginge
tsu no

Kosen</i> bow that used to be the <i>goshintai</i> of <i>Kokuin</i> <i>Jinj
a</i>?

Yes, it’s the same one which Koto-chan had brought along when she returne
d to the

Shrine of the Falling Rain. I forgot to mention this to you, but as soon as
 she

had time, she sent a message all the way to <i>Ise</i> to tell the Council 
of

Priests there that someone had to take the thing away from <i>Furisame</i>

before any demon learned that it was here. My girlfriend had explained to m
e

why she did that. You see, Nikki-chan, with the addition of the <i>Arc of t
he

Silver Moon</i>, <i>Furisame</i> possessed three exceedingly powerful objec
ts

in total. Who would say that the demons, who leveled <i>Kokuin</i> to the g
round,

wouldn’t drool at such a large trove of treasure and decide that they wan
ted

it? However strong the defense that the Sacred Barrier held up was, it stil
l

would crumble if the enemies tried had enough. <i>“Sennen no Koe’s powe
rs is by

no means limitless, and the Sacred Barrier indestructible, Hikari,”</i>

Koto-chan had said in a grim voice. <i>“Besides, the Barrier provides no

protection against physical projectiles. The demon legion I saw in Kiyozumi

that day had enough siege machines and firepower to crush us.” </i>If tha
t were

to happen, even all three <i>goshintai</i> together wouldn’t be able to s
ave

us.<o:p></o:p></p>

text-indent:.5in'><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>And so, that
’s why an

envoy from the Grand Shrine of <i>Ise</i> had to come and get <i>Gingetsu n
o

Kosen</i> the hell away from us, or Hokkaido would risk being turned into a
 sea

of blood and corpses. As to why the envoy, whoever or however important he 
–

yeah, Koto-chan told me it was a he – was, didn’t come to <i>Furisame</
i> to

pick it up instead of making my girlfriend go all the way to the port to ha
nd

it over…. Well, you see, Nikki-chan, the plan was that the envoy must not
 stay

in Hokkaido a second longer than necessary. His duty was to take the <i

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Arc of the Silver Moon</i> and return 
to <i>Ise</i>

the moment the Priestess handed him the <i>goshintai</i>. Remember, Nikki-c
han,

no one, demons and humans alike, must learn that the bow was going to the p
ort.<o:p></o:p></p>

text-indent:.5in'>The day after Koto-chan brought the <i>Arc of the Silver 
Moon</i>

to the <i>Ise</i> envoy, the Mayor Sadamoto Shun'ichi asked her to come to 
the

Colonization Office to discuss with her yet another governmental proposal

concerning the Shrine. I went with her, of course, but he blocked the door 
to

his office right after Koto-chan entered and refused to let me in. Then he 
said

in a dead serious voice that what he got to say to my Koto-chan wasn’t my

business. I was about to argue with him when I suddenly realized that he ha
d

unfolded his paper fan to show me what was written on it. <i>‘Come to

Sengimori, kitsune-chan. My patience grows thin enough already.’</i> I di
dn’t

have to be told to know that line was a summons from Kugimiya Karasu. I

properly excused myself right away and hurried to the spot where the crow d
emon

usually met me in the forest.<o:p></o:p></p>

text-indent:.5in'>He wasn’t pleased. The first thing he did was slapping 
me

across the face so hard that my cheek became swollen immediately and blood 
trickled

out of the corner of my mouth.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

That earned me another slap. My ears rang.<o:p></o:p></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“THEN WHY THE HELL WAS IT STILL THERE?” His mouth was
 so

close to my face that his second roar, delivered at the top of his lung, al
most

hurt my ears enough to bleed. Strangely though, no echoes were made inside 
the

forest despite the amplitude of his voice. He must have warded the surround
ing

with some sort of spells so no one could overhear us unless they got past t
he

warding, I suppose. Once they did… well… without a doubt Karasu would r
ip them

to pieces.<o:p></o:p></p>

back at

him, my voice as loud and fierce, if not more. “HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOL
D YOU

THAT ALREADY?”<o:p></o:p></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“Oh, really?” His hand moved so quickly all I saw was
 a blur

before his fingers wrapped themselves around my throat. The tips of his

fingernails, sharp as any razor, pricked against my skin short of drawing

blood. His teeth, normally white and even, had suddenly borne a striking

resemblance to those of a saw. With his then anger-twisted face, he looked

every inch a monster. “Was it the defense that stopped you, or was it tha
t you

spent too much time making out with your <i>lover</i> to remember your duty
 in

the first place?” He stilled my tongue with that one single word.<o:p></o

text-indent:.5in'>“Don’t play dumb with me, filthy half-breed,” Karas
u barked.

“You think you can hide your little affair from me?” The gaze he fixed 
upon me

was searing-hot, and his grip made his eyes seem cool. I but wondered if my

neck was on fire. “One piece of advice, wench; Unlike <i>Furisame</i> or

Unomichi, Kagemori Forest itself isn’t warded. The ravens there are my sp
ies.

What <i>they</i> see, <i>I </i>see!”<o:p></o:p></p>

text-indent:.5in'>Obscured as Karasu’s words were, they managed to explai

he found out about Koto-chan and my relationship. His ravens, wherever they

were stationed in the Shadow Forest, ought to have seen me giving my girlfr
iend

a goodbye kiss on the lips when I saw her off under the Torii Archway, from

where she departed to deliver the <i>goshintai</i> of <i>Kokuin</i> <i>Jinj
a</i>.

It had to be that, for it was the only time I showed my affection to her

outside of the safe haven protected by the closed doors of the Shrine of th
e

Falling Rain.<o:p></o:p></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>In my head, I hurriedly searched for an answer that would

help me disabuse Karasu of his assumption, however correct, that Koto-chan 
and

I were more than just housemates, or employer and employee. It was a weakne
ss

of mine that I didn’t want him to know I had. I couldn’t even begin to 
imagine

what he could do with it otherwise. I found one.<o:p></o:p></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“Then why the hell did you act as if she was?” Karasu
 didn’t

buy it, and he showed his disbelief by tightening his fingers around my thr
oat

a little bit more. Although the man had made sure that his extremely sharp

fingernails would not cut into my skin, the force he employed still managed
 to

make colorful fireworks explode in my vision. “Well? Speak!”<o:p></o:p>

text-indent:.5in'>“How… do… you…” I croaked, “expect me… to
….” Only then did

the crow demon let go of me and allowed me to gasp for breath. “Why did I
 act

as if she were my lover?” I repeated Karasu’s question and regarded him

contemptuously. His face hardened, but he did nothing about it. “Because 
the

sword will be easier to get that way, you idiot!” A light of comprehensio
n

dawned on the man’s face. “You don’t seriously think that I’m in lo

do you?” I continued, feeling my heart clench at the words I spoke. “Me
? In

love with someone who will tear me apart if she learns that I’m a half-br
eed?

I’m not that much of a fool! I repeat, Kugimiya Karasu, I don’t love he

only trying to use her to get you the sword and protect my own life!”<o:p

those awful lies because I couldn’t afford letting the crow demon know th

truth. You know as well as I do how much I love my Koto-chan, don’t you? 
At

least no one else could have heard me, though, which gave me the confidence
 and

courage.<o:p></o:p></p>

ce shone

in his dark eyes. “There has to be some other weapon in this country that
’s as

powerful as <i>Sennen no Inori</i> and less of a hassle to get!” His word
s sent

chills slithering down my spine. At that moment I knew that Karasu had grow

me last month. The third, also the final one, happened ten days ago, two da

it was rather dangerous there so she was going to go alone. Of course, I wo

of

her love for the people, the culture, and the language. The day I met her w

something the Westerners called a scarf, a piece of textile they wore in

winters to keep their necks warm. She even lent the scarf to me to put it o

own neck for a while. I liked it a lot, for I thought that the feel of the

material – she said it was made from sheep wool – was very nice, as was
 how it

looked. Cathy ended up staying for another hour in the Shrine, telling me h

one used a technique called hand-knitting to make a scarf. Seeing how much 
I

was interested, Cathy offered to teach me hand-knitting if I was willing to

try. I agreed without a second thought. As I accompanied Cathy Hawthorne ba

erupts the moment <i>Sennen no Inori</i>’s edge comes into contact with t

black light enveloping Karasu’s hand. As expected from the incredible sha

of <i>A Thousand Years of Prayers</i>, its blade slices through the defense

barrier and cuts into the man’s palm. Still, the defense barrier wasn’t
 as

strength, and most importantly, give Karasu the time he needed to leap into

and chase after me? Why aren’t you extending the <i>Blade of Water</i> to
 slay

me where I stand? Or… perhaps you no longer can do that?” He glances at
 me.

“Perhaps it was thanks to that little twerp over there? I guess it wasn

entirely useless to have sent her to this Shrine after all.” Tension drai

 She
