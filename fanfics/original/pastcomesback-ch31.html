<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 31 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><pre>      &quot;At least you&#39;re awake this time!&quot; Mina&#39;s comment did little to lessen the sting of 
losing. Isaka let out a sigh as she plopped down on the couch and Josh was introduced to the 
gang.

      &quot;This is the guy I was talking about, Josh. He&#39;s also an exorcist and he was actually 
the one who got his old master to train Krystal,&quot; Seth said. &quot;He happens to be Krystal&#39;s 
cousin, too.&quot;

      Josh gave a wave to everyone and Isaka snapped her fingers. &quot;No wonder he&#39;s so 
familiar!&quot;

      Seth made eye contact with Bakra before guiding Josh to sit next to him. The male 
demon smiled at the young man before turning to Josh. In turn, the blonde raised his 
eyebrows. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m Josh,&quot; he said, holding out a hand.

      Bakra shook it. &quot;Nice to meet you, I&#39;m Bakra.&quot;

      The two of them sat there, making eye contact, perhaps speaking on some other level 
that no one else in the room quite understood. Seth sat down next to Isaka, who whispered, 
&quot;So, is he like a male version of Krystal?&quot;

      Seth snorted. &quot;Nope, he&#39;s like a male version of you. Can&#39;t believe how many times he 
asked me if I needed help changing in the locker room...&quot;

      Isaka nodded and sat back. &quot;So,&quot; Abby started, getting up. &quot;Isaka was a failure, but 
much less so than before, so technically that makes her a success... and now Tsuru is way 
more powerful, right?&quot;

      Isaka sighed. &quot;Yes... sorry. I kind of didn&#39;t expect the sword to multiply her power 
by, like, a gazillion.&quot;

      &quot;Even though Seth told you it would?&quot; Faye asked before continuing. &quot;Look, so we have 
an exorcist now, who seems to me more adept than Krystal was, so I think that some of us 
should go and some of us should stay here.&quot;

      Josh spoke this time. &quot;Possibly. But since the Demon Lord is heading to the Pit of the 
Damned to likely unleash the nastiest things kept down there, then we might have a problem - 
especially if Krystal succumbs to Tsuru. You see, I&#39;m better than Krystal, but she has much 
more potential than I do...&quot;

      Carmilla was seething in her own seat on the couch, furiously stirring her cup of tea. 
&quot;Stupid Krystal... stealing away my Tsuru!&quot;

      Isaka looked over at her. &quot;Hey! It&#39;s not like Krystal asked for it!&quot;

      The vampire just let out a whimper. &quot;I know...! But it&#39;s just not fair that my 
precious knight would...&quot;

      Josh gave them a passing glance before shrugging. He stood up and walked over to his 
bag he left on the floor. &quot;Moving on, I have a feeling we&#39;re not even prepared to go there. 
Two of the girls, Tsuki and Hina I believe, are still technical virgins. There is actually a 
reason behind that... The only way to enter the Pit of the Damned is to have two maidens of 
opposite spectrums open it.&quot;

      Everyone in the room groaned. &quot;Seriously?&quot; Isaka asked. &quot;That&#39;s why Hoshi hasn&#39;t 
screwed their brains out? So, even though Hoshi has touched them, just because she hasn&#39;t 
gone down there means they can still open the way.&quot;

      &quot;Yep,&quot; Josh said. &quot;That and... well, Tsuki and Hina are opposites. The doorway will 
close right behind them, so unless we find two virgins and fast, we&#39;re kind of screwed.&quot;

      &quot;Two virgins?&quot; Erin asked, looking around. &quot;Honestly, we&#39;ve all done it, so... except 
for Tycara, but we don&#39;t have her opposite.&quot;

      Sakura looked over at two girls who had been really quiet. &quot;...what about them...?&quot;

      Eveon and Mina flinched when they were suddenly a part of the conversation. &quot;Oh, hell 
no!&quot; The blonde started. &quot;We are not going to some freaky ass place called the Pit of the 
Damned! Can&#39;t you find someone else?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah,&quot; Mina said. &quot;Do you seriously think we&#39;re opposite enough to open those doors? 
We&#39;ll be nothing more than a liability!&quot;

      Abby looked thoughtful for a moment. &quot;Who knew preventing Eveon from having sex 
yesterday would actually benefit us...?&quot;

      &quot;This is so stupid!&quot; Eveon said, continuing on her rant. &quot;Who makes up these rules 
about &#39;technical virgins&#39;?!&quot;

      Carmilla shrugged and stared at Eveon. &quot;Who cares? All I know is virgin girls are 
super yummy... really yummy...&quot; The vampire looked around. &quot;Am I allowed to feed yet? It&#39;s 
been a while since I attacked Eveon, so-&quot;

      She was shut down by a unanimous shout of &#39;no&#39;.

      Josh closed his book with a sigh. &quot;It&#39;s well known that all virgins possess magical 
powers. The Pit of the Damned is just like that to be a thorn in our side, I suppose.&quot;

      Tycara looked around. &quot;Okay... but if we bring them along, someone has to protect 
them...&quot;

      Seth stood up this time. &quot;And I have just the plan! Eveon and Mina are going to be our 
maidens, so we need them to be protected should the Pit of the Damned be opened.&quot;

      Mina raised her hand. &quot;What would happen to us if it opens?&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;ll be devoured by demonic spirits and turned into some sadistic monster,&quot; Josh 
said, nonchalant.

      &quot;Like that would be any different from her now,&quot; Abby snorted, getting a death glare 
from Mina.

      Seth cleared his throat and continued on. &quot;I will stay behind with Eveon and Mina and 
so will Abby and Tycara. Considering we&#39;re all rather inept at fighting, it would be best if 
we stayed out of the way... so Tycara and Abby can provide us with enough protection. We&#39;ll 
also set up a base camp at the entrance should we have to retreat.&quot;

      Bakra looked around. &quot;So I&#39;m assuming that the rest of us will go on ahead?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah,&quot; Seth said. &quot;Josh with the help of Sakura should be able to create a path 
leading to the actual center of the pit. Due to the amount of dark energy there and the fact 
that it&#39;s Tsuru and Krystal, Isaka will have to be our primary attacker.&quot;

      The mentioned demon sunk lower into her seat. &quot;Really? Are you sure? Isn&#39;t Faye 
stronger than me?&quot;

      The Goddess of Love smiled. &quot;Well, I&#39;m not meant to come in contact with a vast amount 
of demonic energy and it&#39;s your battle.&quot;

      &quot;If I lose and the world ends, it&#39;s all your guy&#39;s faults...&quot;

      &quot;Anyway, that means Erin, Faye, Carmilla and Bakra will have to fight Tsuki, Hina and 
possibly Hoshi... though I suspect Hoshi will be encountered by Josh and Sakura. Once the 
two of them take care of the last obstacle for Isaka, one of them will keep the way open 
while the other goes back to help in the fight.&quot; Seth looked at the two of them. &quot;You guys 
can decide that when you get there.&quot;

      Everyone nodded and agreed on it, save for two disgruntled teenagers, one starving 
vampire and a pressured demon. With a sigh, Isaka peeked into the bag at her feet. It was 
the remains of Tsuru&#39;s swords...

      &quot;Do you want to fix them?&quot; Isaka looked up to see the living room was empty, save for 
Erin.

      &quot;Yeah, but I don&#39;t know how...&quot;

      The green haired woman grinned and motioned to the backyard. &quot;I can summon this really 
cool fire breathing lizard so we can try to reforge them... I used to assist the God of 
Metal when he needed the extra heat.&quot;

      Isaka followed her outside. &quot;But these swords were special, you know? They were for 
exorcists and had...&quot; The demon trailed off and handed Erin the bag. &quot;Hold on a sec.&quot;

      She walked over to the kitchen where Tycara was currently trying to convince Seth that 
15 was old enough to kiss.

      &quot;C&#39;mon, Seth! I&#39;ve waited for months for us to be together!&quot;

      &quot;Y-yeah, but you&#39;re growing fast now... it would only be a day or two-&quot;

      &quot;Seth!&quot;

      Isaka rolled her eyes. &quot;Sorry to interrupt this pedophilic crime in the making, but 
Tycara, I need you to make some swords magical.&quot;

      The hybrid just stared at her. &quot;What?&quot;

      &quot;Magical swords - you know, shoot them up light and dark energy?&quot;

      &quot;Isaka, I don&#39;t know how to do that...&quot; Her little sister figure said, doubt showing 
on her face.

      Seth, however, came to the rescue. &quot;Oh, I read about that kind of stuff in a book. 
It&#39;s actually easy if you... wait, why are we doing this?&quot;

      &quot;I always wanted swords to compensate- shoot, Seth! I&#39;m preparing to fight Tsuru!&quot;

      The young man just nodded, still doubtful. &quot;Uh-huh...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;So, you&#39;re a swordsmen?&quot;

      Bakra had been sitting at the dining room table, drinking some soda, when Josh came 
over. &quot;Yeah,&quot; the demon said, leaning back against his chair.

      Eveon was across the table, eating a sandwich her mother had made her since Mina was 
sent home to avoid any tainting of their virginity. She was also trying not to turn around, 
since Carmilla was inconspicuously spying on her from the doorway. Sakura was quietly 
talking things over with Abby while keeping an eye on the vampire, but soon the couple began 
to focus on the two men.

      &quot;Do you think you&#39;ll be able to take down those girls?&quot;

      Bakra shrugged. &quot;Of course, it just takes a little strategy, you know? Actually, how 
do you fight?&quot;

      &quot;A spear,&quot; Josh said, with a small smile. &quot;It&#39;s pretty versatile - you can slash, 
stab, or push enemies away with ease.&quot;

      &quot;Holy weapon, huh?&quot; Josh nodded.

      &quot;Hey, Bakra, do you want to go practice a bit before we leave for the Pit of the 
Damned?&quot; Josh asked, giving him a bigger smile.

      The demon took a moment to answer, thinking about everything. &quot;Alright,&quot; he said, 
standing up. &quot;But before we do anything, we should at least get to know each other... talk a 
bit about strategy.&quot;

      Josh nodded. &quot;That&#39;s cool - just jumping right into it without warming up or knowing 
your training partner could be pretty bad.&quot;

      The two men left the room, making small talk about their favorite styles of fighting. 
Abby watched them leave, rolling her eyes.

      &quot;You know what - I&#39;m making it so everyone has to wash their own sheets instead.&quot;

      Eveon just gave her a puzzled look. &quot;What are you talking about, mommy? They said they 
were just going to go practice fighting.&quot;

      Sakura walked over to her daughter and started to ruffle her blonde hair. &quot;Oh, 
Eveon... you&#39;re so naive.&quot;

      As the blonde turned a deep shade of red, Abby got up from the table. &quot;At least they 
said they were going to take it slow...&quot; Sakura soon followed after, leaving Eveon to her 
sandwich... and at the mercy of a hungry vampire.

      &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; Eveon tensed up at the sound of the voice in her ear. Carmilla 
didn&#39;t waste any time...

      &quot;Uh... quite w-well,&quot; Eveon stuttered out, putting down her sandwich and looking for 
an escape route. However, with Carmilla slipping into Eveon&#39;s chair, the blonde didn&#39;t see 
much of a way. Why were her mommies so unaware of the danger they keep putting her in?

      The moment Eveon tried to bolt, Carmilla just sat down in the chair and yanked the 
girl back into her lap. &quot;So you feel okay? No sudden weakness or light headedness?&quot;

      &quot;N-no!&quot; Eveon squeaked out, trying to struggle.

      &quot;That&#39;s good - it means you&#39;re okay to donate a meal!&quot; Carmilla grinned, her canines 
seeming longer than before. Eveon shrunk away, but let out a yelp when Carmilla&#39;s hand went 
under her shirt.

      &quot;Wh-what are you doing?! Don&#39;t you like Tsuru?! And I have a girlfriend!&quot;

      &quot;Ah, but aroused virgin girls taste even better... this is all in the name of food, 
Eveon... food...&quot;

      That didn&#39;t keep the vampire from leaving a hickey on her neck or fondling her 
breasts, however. Eveon could only imagine all the crap she was going to go through once 
Mina realized what Carmilla had done...

      The vampire bit her neck and Eveon flinched before calming down. She... felt funny.

      &quot;You know, I think we forgot something,&quot; Abby said, going back into the dining room 
with Sakura. She was horrified at what she saw and froze on the spot. Sakura, however, was 
none too delighted to see a vampire all over her daughter.

      Carmilla had been in paradise feeding off Eveon, but it soon came to close when she 
got a shock of holy energy to the head. She dislodged her fangs and fell over on the ground. 
Eveon lost her balance as well and Abby caught her.

      &quot;Oh my goodness, Eveon, I am such a horrible mother, I am so sorry,&quot; Abby said, 
cradling her daughter.

      &quot;No, no, I&#39;m okay, but...oh, did she have to leave a hickey? Jeez, Carmilla! Can&#39;t you 
leave me alone?!&quot; Eveon shouted, starting to regain herself.

      The vampire sat up. &quot;But you&#39;re so delicious...!&quot; Her whine was cut off when she 
noticed the very pissed off angel standing in front of her.

      &quot;Uh,&quot; Carmilla started, wiping at her bloody lips. &quot;...please don&#39;t purify me...?&quot;

      The angel&#39;s hand started to glow with light and the vampire knew she was in for a 
world of hurt.

      Abby placed a napkin over the bite wounds as she said, &quot;I really forgot she was 
there... oh, Eveon... after this is all over, I&#39;ll make it up to you by going away somewhere 
with Sakura and leaving you with the house for a whole weekend.&quot;

      Her daughter was stunned, ignoring Carmilla&#39;s cries as she was attacked by Sakura. 
&quot;Really?! You would... do that?&quot;

      Abby gave her a wry smile. &quot;If you let your daughter almost get eaten twice within a 
24 hour time span, I&#39;m sure you&#39;d feel guilty too.&quot; She helped up Eveon and the two watched 
as Carmilla was hiding in the corner.

      &quot;I promise I&#39;ll be a good parasite - honest!&quot;

      Sakura seemed as stoic as ever, though there was a hint of smile on her face. 

***** 

      &quot;I thought you were the snake goddess,&quot; Isaka said, staring at the tiny lizard in 
Erin&#39;s hands.

      &quot;Well, I deal with a lot more than snakes. I control the amount of them and how much 
they eat. Snakes serve an important role in controlling rodent populations and helping 
crops. Also, I have an influence over all reptiles.&quot;

      Tycara stared at her in wonder. &quot;Can you control crocodiles?&quot;

      Erin shrugged. &quot;I... haven&#39;t ever tried. Plus, it&#39;s not controlling so much as 
communication. They see me as their mother or master, so they love to do favors for me.&quot;

      As if on cue, the lizard hissed out a fireball. Isaka stared at it, disturbed. &quot;Are... 
are you sure this is a good idea?&quot;

      Erin smiled. &quot;Of course it is! Just be sure stay at least five feet away when he 
starts working...&quot;

      Seth gulped and backed away, looking at Tycara. &quot;Okay, once he starts melting the 
metal, be sure to use your power to reshape it into a blade and attach it to the broken 
hilt.&quot;

      With a snort, the lizard jumped down to the ground, causing everyone else but Erin to 
back away in fright.

      &quot;If Abby finds out we&#39;re doing this...&quot; Isaka murmured.

      &quot;She is so going to kill us,&quot; Seth finished.
