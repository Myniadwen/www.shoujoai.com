<a href="../original/champions-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Meet Lady Snowblood

To her, the world was covered in darkness, and yet she could see clearer 
than any other person.

The manifested auras of thirty of her personal guard stood out like 
stars against inky darkness as she led them through the plains. She 
carried a walking-stick before her, but had little use for it since she 
could literally sense everything ahead of her: the future was her 
vision, and she could see everything it had to offer, at least in 
short-term effects. She could feel the tree coming and stepped aside; 
she could feel half her guard splitting up, and let them go; she could 
sense that her target had been here, perhaps three days earlier, if her 
intuition was right...

&quot;Through here,&quot; she said, indicating a forest she could not see. The end 
of it was near; she reached it before everybody else, and took the spare 
time to catch her breath and clear her mind. Despite countless ages of 
training, she was distracted from her goal by the more pressing 
engagement, but she could not falter. She could not. She had to move on, 
for her. Setting her jaw, the blind woman staked out ahead of the 
others, momentarily forgetting that she could not disregard them. The 
group managed to leave the forest fifteen minutes later, exhausted and 
weary; their guide and master was already long gone, and she left no 
trail.

She allowed them time to catch up, but looked impatient when they came 
by. A few of the more insubordinate ones gave her ineffective glares; 
one dropped his gear and growled at her.

&quot;You have the nerve to leave us behind like that? With the orders you 
were given?!&quot;

&quot;Call it zeal,&quot; she replied evenly. She stood up and walked on, not 
allowing them to rest from their long hike. The man yelled at her, 
indignant.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m not through with you, woman! Come back here! The lord might 
have put you in charge, but I&#39;m not going to obey you if you disregard 
us and your orders! ...Are you even listening?!&quot; Without missing a beat, 
turning around, or even stopping, she answered.

&quot;With a level of noise like that, it&#39;s a miracle our target hasn&#39;t heard 
us coming.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?! You little...&quot;

Thwing! The man stood gawking, paralyzed, then fell to the ground 
suddenly.

Dead.

The blind woman slowly put her sword back inside her walking stick and 
continued.

&quot;I presume there will be no further delays.&quot;

The rest of the guard set a record by scrambling so quickly.

.........

Neither Rin Takamatsu nor Hsu Kai Lin were lazy people, but since they 
didn&#39;t know anything about fixing motorbikes, they didn&#39;t see the point 
of hurrying along anyway. Rin&#39;s beloved steed had broken down on them 
while they were on the road, and since the nearest town was in 
who-knows-where land, and the day was so beautiful, they didn&#39;t see why 
there needed to be such a rush. They deserved a rest anyway, and BaoBao 
had been crankier than usual.

&quot;It&#39;s because you keep her stuffed in that sling of yours,&quot; said Rin 
lazily. The thin stalk of wheat in her mouth wiggled left and right when 
she spoke: &quot;I keep telling you to let her romp around and stretch her 
legs. Of course, she&#39;ll one day get too big for you to carry, and too 
bulky for me to worry about. You know how pandas are; she&#39;s not staying 
a cub forever.&quot; Kailin ignored her and continued to play with her 
adopted friend. Rin sighed in contentment and smiled, just happy that 
the two of them had some time to relax at last. What with vengeance, 
running from pursuers (or engaging them in battle), and general mayhem 
mixed in with it all...

&quot;Hey,&quot; she said a little later, &quot;you two fine ladies hungry? I could go 
for a snack.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. Um, we ate all our fruit, and BaoBao finished off the bamboo.&quot;

&quot;She can have it,&quot; mumbled Takamatsu. She was almost too lazy to get up 
and scrounge, but luckily, her stomach was strong-willed. She forced 
herself up and went searching for the knapsack that kept their food, but 
rummaging around did no good&#151;they were fresh out.

&quot;Darn,&quot; said Kailin when she heard the news. &quot;Well, you&#39;re much faster 
than I am. You can go into town, find a mechanic and some food, and have 
them drive you here.&quot; Rin hummed to herself, glad that the younger girl 
was finally developing some more brains, and hopped to her feet.

&quot;That&#39;s a great idea. Of course, all those things cost money, and that 
last job we took didn&#39;t exactly make us rich. I hope you like noodles 
and rice, because that&#39;s all we&#39;ll be able to afford.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a banquet,&quot; moaned the poor girl, obviously famished. Rin 
smiled gently, and took off running, though she had no idea where. She 
got about five miles into the road before feeling hopeless, and five 
more before ultimately feeling like she should give up. Perhaps if they 
backtracked...

Rin the Ronin suddenly got a chill in her spine. She was all 
alone&#151;except for one person, hiding in the tall grass.

&quot;Step out!&quot; she shouted. The man stood up, grinning, bearing firearms 
that could tear through stone. Rin grimaced. &quot;Ach, I&#39;m in too bad of a 
mood to let you off easily! I hope you didn&#39;t plan on having an 
expensive funeral!&quot; Minutes later, the intruder was dead and Rin was 
back on the road, only running in the opposite direction. So they had 
been discovered after all! Maybe they had only been waiting for the two 
Ronin to split up, and if that was the case, then Kailin...

She can take care of herself, Rin forced herself to believe, but 
something was nagging at her, something that gave her a lot of doubt and 
fear. Kailin could handle nine, but what if she was up against nineteen? 
Or ninety? Or nine hundred?

&quot;KAILIN!!!&quot;

Rin screeched to a halt, sending dust high into the air, and coughed as 
she caught her breath. Not only was Kailin safe, she looked rather 
bored.

&quot;Back so soon? I didn&#39;t think there were any towns near here. Why&#39;d you 
scream my name?&quot;

&quot;Are you hurt, are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine. Why, what happened?&quot; Rin told her; the concern on the 
young girl&#39;s face was evident. They had no choice but to ignore the bike 
and press on, with Hsu clinging onto Rin&#39;s back as she sprinted as fast 
as she could to the nearest town. She gave her motorcycle a sentimental 
rub before apologizing to it and running off. If somebody stole that 
thing, they would be better off going as far away as possible!

Their journey was stopped twelve miles down the road by a colossal wall 
of fire. Kailin gasped in shock and fell off; she clutched her breast as 
the immense flames shot out right before them. She immediately set about 
trying to calm the flames with her power, but there didn&#39;t seem to be 
any use. The blaze was apparently deaf and stubborn.

&quot;Over here!&quot; shouted a voice. Rin knocked Kailin to the ground and dove 
as a flurry of bullets came their way. Her father&#39;s sword was out and 
ready for combat; she wanted to fly in and pile up the bodies, but 
something stopped her. Before she could even strike at the nearest 
assailant, something hard slashed at her forehead, knocking her back to 
the ground in pain. She scowled and cursed, rubbing her poor head and 
demanding in a rather vulgar tone who in the world had the guts to do 
such a thing.

The blind woman emerged from the crowd and stated clearly, &quot;I do.&quot;

Rin snorted and stood up to meet the new face; Hsu clutched BaoBao 
meekly. The other woman looked to be Rin&#39;s age, and had identical black 
hair, only hers was tied up with pins, and she had very dark glasses. 
The woman wore a lilac kimono and a straw hat; she carried a walking 
stick, which Rin assumed had been used to strike her. The woman removed 
her hat and bowed politely.

&quot;I am not mistaken when I address you as Rin Takamatsu, am I?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no. Who wants to know?&quot;

&quot;I already know,&quot; said the lady coolly, &quot;as you can see. I think you 
have company; may I be introduced?&quot; Rin snorted and crossed her arms.

&quot;No! Who do you think you are, anyway? Did you put that great big wall 
of fire in front of us?&quot;

&quot;No, my subordinates did. But I was the one who asked them to.&quot;

&quot;What for? Are you part of the group that&#39;s following us?&quot;

&quot;Which one?&quot;

&quot;Any of them!&quot; The lady frowned, not that her stoic fa&ccedil;ade could get any 
graver.

&quot;We are part of a group that is in pursuit of you, yes. I did not think 
we would find you so quickly. Word has gotten around that you were 
responsible for that laboratory explosion not long ago.&quot;

&quot;So what, you want vengeance?&quot;

&quot;We are not affiliated with that laboratory,&quot; answered the woman. &quot;Nor 
do any of us hold a personal grudge against you yourself. The woman 
called Rin Takamatsu is of very little consequence to us; it&#39;s your 
father we want.&quot;

&quot;My father? What for?&quot;

&quot;Retribution,&quot; she answered, revealing the sword hidden in her walking 
stick. Rin growled.

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;Your father owes our group money. And he also owes us his blood. Part 
of our job is to find him and make him pay his debts. But part of it 
also is to wipe out his line. You are part of his line. Therefore...&quot;

&quot;All right, so what about all that nonsense saying I&#39;m not important, 
huh?!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t owe us money. You&#39;re just the daughter of the wrong man.&quot;

&quot;You wanna insult my father, you come closer and do it!&quot;

&quot;I just may.&quot; Patta-patta-patta-shing! Before Rin could blink, the woman 
was pressed right next to her, the sword against her stomach and a small 
throwing knife pointed to her throat. Stunned, the powerful Ronin could 
barely even breathe. She had moved so quickly! And she knew exactly 
where Rin was! Fortunately, the tension didn&#39;t last, as the woman 
relinquished her hold on Rin and stepped back.

&quot;Draw your sword,&quot; she said. &quot;I will not fight an unarmed opponent.&quot; Now 
enraged beyond help, Rin showed the world just how fast she could draw, 
and held her weapon aloft. Her opponent bowed and finally introduced 
herself. &quot;I am called Snowblood. It is an honor to meet you.&quot; The two 
women chased after each other; they crashed and slashed violently. 
Kailin forced her eyes closed and refused to watch; BaoBao wailed and 
hid behind her legs. She could still hear them fighting each other, 
metal bashing against metal, grunts and groans coming from both women as 
they fought just to stay alive.

Rin was by far more powerful, but Snowblood was quick, and she had the 
gift of premonition on her side. She could predict Rin&#39;s movements and 
sense where her energy would be spent, thus able to counter everything 
effortlessly. She couldn&#39;t possibly hold off the other woman&#39;s attacks, 
but with limited clairvoyance, she didn&#39;t have to: if Rin attacked, 
Snowblood would merely strafe or roll or jump away, and return to 
counter. It was a difficult opponent to fight against, needless to say. 
The two came after each other violently; once, while locked together, 
Rin growled something to her enemy.

&quot;Just promise me one thing, to leave the kid and the panda out of this. 
They&#39;ve got nothing to do with it.&quot;

&quot;I swear it will be done. Our fight is with you.&quot; Rin smiled.

&quot;Gee, pretty honorable, huh? If I didn&#39;t have to mow you down, I&#39;d 
almost like you!&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Snowblood smirked, pushed, and sliced at Rin&#39;s face. She barely 
avoided getting her nose chopped off, but stumbled in the process. 
Snowblood was at her feet, stabbing and thrusting madly as Rin tried to 
regain her footing. Kailin, in the meantime, screamed for them to stop, 
but her words were useless. She kept her eyes on Snowblood&#39;s entourage, 
who so far had done very little, but looked ready to join the fray at 
anytime.

&quot;I think it&#39;s time I helped out,&quot; she said to her panda friend. BaoBao 
whined, almost saying &quot;Don&#39;t go, it&#39;s dangerous&quot;. Hsu pointed her hands 
at the entourage and screamed, calling forth flames to engulf them and 
chase them away. To her surprise, the very fires from the burning wall 
leaped forward and surrounded them all, some dancing on their clothes, 
others burning the dry ground before them. The wall slowly faded as its 
children were birthed; eventually there was nothing left except a few 
stray blazes, and no guards to speak of. Both Rin and Snowblood had 
stopped to observe the spectacle, and were impressed.

&quot;The factory&#39;s destruction makes a little more sense now,&quot; said the 
latter. Rin crossed her arms.

&quot;Yeah, Kailin&#39;s a real firecracker. Waitaminute, why are we talking?! 
You&#39;re gonna pay for insulting my father!&quot; She swung...

&quot;But it is your father who will pay!&quot; She countered... Kailin groaned.

&quot;Oh, here we go again. And they seemed to get along when they weren&#39;t 
trying to kill each other.&quot; BaoBao voiced an unknown opinion and leaped 
into her arms for a better look. With a reduced audience, Snowblood 
seemed to be fighting with less ferocity and more grace. Rin too seemed 
to have a more fluid form, and from time to time they even complimented 
each other.

&quot;Your teacher...must have been...very good!&quot;

&quot;I was raised in the art of the shinobi.&quot;

&quot;Oh, it makes sense now! And all this from a blind woman! How do you do 
it?&quot; A trace of pride was in the other woman&#39;s smile and voice.

&quot;I have the skill of foresight.&quot;

&quot;Oh, cheater!&quot;

&quot;But you have exceptional strength. I must admit, you are the worthiest 
foe I&#39;ve ever fought.&quot;

&quot;Same to you.&quot; They paused to catch their breath and assess their 
wounds, and exchanged a smile of understanding. &quot;Not bad,&quot; said Rin. 
&quot;It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had to work in a fight.&quot;

&quot;I feel the same. And I apologize for insulting your father. I don&#39;t 
know him personally, so it was uncalled for.&quot; Takamatsu raised an 
eyebrow, grinning.

&quot;Wow, you&#39;re really something. Apology accepted. So you still wanna kill 
me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said with regret, &quot;but I have no choice. I don&#39;t expect 
you to understand...&quot;

&quot;Eh, you can tell me later&#151;that is, if I live that long.&quot; They both 
smirked, and saluted with their weapons.

&quot;Indeed.&quot; They resumed their war&#151;and Kailin resumed blocking the fight 
out. She hoped that Rin would come out alive, but she didn&#39;t want 
Snowblood to be killed, even if she was an enemy. The two of them fought 
each other for what seemed like an hour, maybe two, ignorant of 
everything else. And they seemed glad because of it! Honestly, though 
she had been the student of a great monk once, Kailin couldn&#39;t 
understand why some fighters seemed happiest in the midst of a battle.

Eventually, Rin defeated Snowblood, but only by use of her superior 
strength. It was clear just how evenly the battle had went until that 
last moment, and if circumstances had been different, Rin might&#39;ve been 
under Snowblood&#39;s boot. As it was, Rin stood over her opponent, knelt 
down, and offered her hand. Snowblood studied it deeply before taking 
it.

&quot;I see you have great honor too,&quot; she murmured, dusting herself off. 
&quot;That only makes my job worse. Please understand, Rin. I have no choice 
in the matter. I must kill you or else.&quot;

&quot;Or else what?&quot; she said curiously. &quot;Come on, out with it. You could at 
least do me that courtesy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but...I cannot speak of it.&quot; Snowblood hid her face beneath 
her straw hat, bowed, and put her sword away. &quot;Of course, do not think 
that I will enjoy it. Now that I&#39;ve seen your character in battle, 
killing you will be even harder. Would that I could avoid it! You are 
too great and honorable an opponent to waste, but I truly do not have a 
choice. For the time being, though, let us part ways and recover.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, so you&#39;re letting me off the hook?&quot; Snowblood smiled faintly.

&quot;For the time being. We will meet again soon, Rin. I&#39;m looking forward 
to it. Hopefully, we will both be stronger for that encounter. Until 
then, take care of yourself.&quot; She waved and was gone; Rin&#39;s eyes 
couldn&#39;t follow her as a smoke screen came up. She turned around, 
wincing from the fumes, and leered at Kailin.

&quot;Whaddyou make of it?&quot;

&quot;Um...no comment?&quot;

&quot;Come on.&quot; She smiled brightly and repeated herself. &quot;Oh, you&#39;ve got to 
have something to say!&quot; She rolled her eyes and chuckled.

&quot;If I tell you, I&#39;ll be in trouble.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but you got that panda to protect you. You know I can&#39;t win 
against her cuteness.&quot; Kailin giggled and tickled BaoBao; Rin cursed 
mildly as she remembered she still had a bike to fix, and dismissed 
herself to the whims of the road. Kailin followed, not wanting to be 
left behind.

.........

&quot;Lady Snowblood, this is Sashuo! I demand that you give me any report on 
the Takamatsu family! Lady Snowblood, do you copy?&quot;

&quot;I copy,&quot; she answered, speaking into the phone.

&quot;Well?&quot; he growled. &quot;What do you know? Answer!&quot; Snowblood paused for 
awhile before speaking.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, milord, but I don&#39;t have any information.&quot;

To be continued.

Xianq: Whoa, what a story! I think they like each other!

Kris: No, really? Oh, the introductions!

Xianq: Oh yeah! Hey there everybody, it&#39;s Bubblegum Black again, here 
with my partner BK Power!

Kris: What&#39;s up, everybody? Well, our team finally gets to show what 
it&#39;s made of in the next chapter, and it looks as if G-Force might join 
us as well.

Xianq: Hey, didn&#39;t Father Jacob say something about a tournament 
earlier?

Kris: That he did. You think the three women in this episode will be 
there?

Xianq: Definitely. I think he might ask us to fight in it, too. Well, as 
long as there&#39;s money involved, right?

Kris: She never gives up...

Xianq: Stay tuned for the next installment, &quot;Battle Diva Royale&quot;! I 
guarantee it&#39;ll be a blast!
