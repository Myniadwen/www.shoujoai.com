<h1>In My Heart and In My Mind (part 12 of 28)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Sam sat with Trish for a while, the two of them simply talking the way 
they used to, however this time she could feel the usually tension 
between them loosening. It was as if the simply knowledge of each others 
feelings made that unusual tension that sometimes appeared over them to 
drift away. Occasionally Trish would touch Sam&#39;s hand and pull away, but 
Sam assured the girl that it was alright to touch her, in fact she 
internally liked the feeling of the girl&#39;s touch but did not want to 
tell Trish for fear that it would get the girl&#39;s hopes up too quickly. 
They rang the nurse soon after and asked for a couple of movies to watch 
on the small television that hung on the wall in the corner of the room. 
Before long Trish was sitting next to Sam on the bed as they watched a 
movie, cuddling close to each other. Sam was beginning to enjoy the 
closeness of her friend at her side when she suddenly felt a voice come 
to the surface of her mind and she remembered Star was still part of her 
mind. 

((Sam?!?)) Star&#39;s anxious voice called out through the fog, ((Sam, can 
you hear me?)) 

Sam smiled at the sound of the girl&#39;s voice, ((Star? I&#39;m glad to hear 
you again.)) 

Star let out a sigh of relief, ((What happened? I lost you there for a 
moment.)) 

((Sorry, I think it was the drugs.)) Sam suggested with a shrug, ((The 
moment after I took them it was like my mind was filled with a fog and I 
couldn&#39;t hear you anymore.)) 

((I was scared there for a moment.)) Star stated worriedly, ((I finally 
decided to search for you and I nearly loose you again.)) 

Sam smiled again, ((I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll loose each other. Wait you are 
searching for me?))

Star nodded, ((I have no idea where to start, but I think you have to be 
in town somewhere, a year older, but still you.)) 

Sam frowned, ((How will my older self take that? I mean we don&#39;t even 
know what will happen in a year.)) 

Star smiled, ((I have a feeling you will be glad to see me, as happy as 
I will be to see you.)) She said confidently. 

Sam nodded in agreement, ((I know I want to meet you now so I&#39;ll sure as 
hell will still want to meet you a year from now.)) She glanced over at 
Trish, who was entranced by the movie, ((Did you hear I&#39;m moving in with 
Trish and her mother.)) Sam inquired excitedly. 

Star frowned, ((Yeah, I heard. You must be happy. I mean you get to be 
with the one you love.)) 

Sam shook her head, ((I&#39;m not sure if I love her or not. We talked 
things out and decided to just see how things go, but now I&#39;m at least 
accepting that there is a chance that I could love a girl.)) 

This caused Star&#39;s heart to flutter and Sam could feel it, ((That is 
wonderful.)) She exclaimed with more excitement then she meant. 

Sam chuckled lightly, ((Thanks for talking to me yesterday. I think I 
would have kept running if it wasn&#39;t for you. Thanks.)) 

Star lightly flushed, ((It is nothing. I just let you talk was all. I&#39;m 
just glad you have come to terms with yourself.)) 

Sam felt Trish snuggle into her a little closer and could feel her heart 
racing even more and let out a sigh, ((So am I. Even if this doesn&#39;t 
turn out to be love it is nice to be loved by someone.)) 

Star smiled, ((I know what you mean...)) Abruptly she stopped speaking 
and Sam felt an intense amount of dread fill her heart. 

((What is going on?)) Sam inquired, worried for her new friend, ((Is 
everything alright?)) 

*******

Star stood with her hand upon the knob to her home, the door slightly 
ajar and a sensation of intense fear and pain filled began to fill her 
heart. Quickly she pushed open the door to find the house dark, with all 
the curtains pulled shut and the lights out. Deep down she hoped that 
this only meant that her mother was out getting groceries or maybe 
prepared something for her birthday and would jump out to surprised her 
at any moment, but she knew that was not true because of waves of fear 
and anger emitted from the house, feeling that never before arose from 
her home before, that was usually lively and warm. Something dreadful 
has just happened in her house and she was almost frightened to enter 
the place, but the thought of her mother hurt made her enter the house 
in search of what could have caused these emotions to fill her home. The 
muffled sounds of beeps came from her handbag, but she ignored and as 
she moved further into the house.  

((Is everything alright?)) Sam inquired yet again.

((I... I... don&#39;t know...)) Star stammered as her eyes adjusted to the 
gloom and she walked down the front hall to the living room, which was 
off to her right, and stopped dead in her tracks as her worst nightmares 
became true. The living room was filled with many colourful balloons and 
streamers, which she knew must have been put in place by her mother as 
she waited to surprise her when she returned home. A cake sat upon the 
octagon table in the middle of the room with candles awaiting being set 
a blaze for some lucky person to make a wish upon. In the middle of the 
room lay a scene that she expected to only see in the movies. Her mother 
lay on her back in an unnatural position with a pool of blood upon her 
stomach and another forming under her back. A second hole could be seen 
in the woman&#39;s neck and yet another in her shoulder. Instantly Star 
realized that her mother had been shot and was more then likely dead, 
but something inside of her didn&#39;t believe what her eyes told her. 

Thinking that this was all some kind of cruel birthday prank and that 
her mother would get up to surprise her, she took a step into the room 
with the intention of finding out if her mother was in fact dead when 
she felt something move in the shadows off to her left. As she turned 
she saw a tall man standing in the shadows with something in his hand. 
Her mind quickly told her to run, but her feet did not respond to her 
command as she stared in disbelief at the person before her. 

*****

((Star???)) Sam worriedly inquired again. She could sense something was 
indeed wrong as every part of her body filled with a sense of panic and 
fear, ((Star!?!)) She called out again, but the girl did not respond. 
Frightened and curious Sam slowly closed her eyes to get a glimpse at 
what could have frightened her friend so badly. The sight of blood 
shocked her as her eyes set upon Star&#39;s mother lying on the floor in 
front of her. A breath caught in her throat as she realized that the 
woman was dead and just as she was about to call out for Star to flee 
she felt someone move to her left and Star turned to face a man standing 
in the shadows. Before she could understand what was going on her ears 
shook with the sound of a loud bang and something hot ripped through her 
side. Her hands quickly moved to her side and could feel warm blood 
seeping through her fingertips. Star starred down at a wound in her 
side, her fingers covered in crimson, dripping over her fingers to 
off-white carpet. She glanced up again to see the man step closer, a gun 
in his hand and a second later a flash exploded in front of her face and 
the world turned dark. Nothing but silence followed as Samantha slipped 
out of consciousness once again.

***** 

Trish was startled as Samantha suddenly sat up right. Her eyes were 
closed, but there was an intense expression of fear upon her face. 
Abruptly Sam clenched her side and slowly moved her trembling hands 
before her face, as if seeing them through her closed eyes. Trisha 
reached out to touch the girl, to wake her from whatever nightmare she 
was trapped in. Just as her fingers were about to touch the girl her 
head snapped back and she fell to the bed, limp. 

Franticly Trish grabbed her friend by the shoulders and lightly shook 
her, &quot;Samantha?&quot; She shook the girl again, &quot;Samantha? What happened???&quot; 
Not knowing what to do she jumped out of the bed and rushed out of the 
room, in search of help.
