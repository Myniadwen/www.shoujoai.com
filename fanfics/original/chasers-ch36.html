<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 36 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/chasers-ch35.html">Back to Part 35</a><pre>The car smoothly came to a stop, the unusually average
looking black haired young woman getting out a few
seconds later, her clothes a bit rumpled but still
neat. Ignoring any curious glances she strode into the
Lowtown building, through the dark halls to eventually
reach a suite that she unlocked with a keycard.

Inside the front hall the little blonde held the stun
gun ready for a moment before finally identifying her
and putting the small device away. &quot;Welcome back,
Beta,&quot; she said, casually dressed in shirt and jeans.

Beta followed her into the dingy rooms, ignoring the
smell of decay that the old building had. &quot;Thank you,
Gamma. Has Alpha or Delta returned from their outings
yet?&quot;

&quot;Delta is surfing the internet,&quot; Gamma said as the
slightly smaller woman led her into the living room,
&quot;while Alpha is still out trying to get information
the old fashioned way.&quot;

&quot;Bribery?&quot; Beta asked, noting that Delta was indeed
sitting at the computer rig that they had built from
several older systems, the brown haired woman&#39;s eyes
closed, her expression peaceful. From a tear in the
back of her arm a cable snaked to connect to the
computer, a hard interface allowing instant access and
searching.

&quot;You&#39;re getting better at humor,&quot; Delta noted
distractedly, her eyes oddly vague as the majority of
her attention was focused on her task.

Gamma smiled wryly, &quot;Well, when our creators designed
we recon androids, they put much of their efforts into
the interactive software.&quot;

&quot;We need to come up with some better designations,
though,&quot; Beta noted as she moved to the couch,
detaching a cable from her arm and connecting to a
modified power outlet. &quot;Human names will help us to
blend better.&quot;

Gamma hesitated, unsure how to respond, then shrugged
slightly. &quot;Naming ourselves for our positions seemed
fitting,&quot; she finally managed.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Beta acknowledged, savoring the feeling
of power flowing into her systems, recharging internal
batteries..

Delta disconnected from the terminal a few moments
later, unplugging the cable from her arm with a loud
pop. She smoothed the skin down over the little hole,
as it was designed the synthetic flesh flowed back
together to form a seamless whole once more. &quot;Well,
that was unpleasant,&quot; she rubbed at her arm
unconsciously.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Beta asked, leaning forward slightly.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Gamma held up a hand to stop them, her eyes
narrowing as she tilted her head slightly, &quot;someone is
coming.&quot;

With a keystroke Delta cleared the screen of the data
that she had been accessing, instead bringing up a
standard screensaver even as Gamma went for her
sidearm, hiding it in her palm. Beta disconnected from
the power outlet, gesturing for them to wait as she
went to the door just as a knock was heard. &quot;Yes?&quot; she
called out.

&quot;I&#39;m back,&quot; and Alpha opened up the door. The tall
redhead wore a fine suit, her black clothes giving her
a almost regal air along with the carefully done make
up ad hairstyle. All of it was calculated to provide
an sense of authority and it worked very well. She was
their leader, the Alpha of their squad, and they all
knew it.

Gamma looked confused then smiled suddenly, &quot;You used
your cloak to prevent me from picking up any emissions
from you!&quot;

&quot;Very good,&quot; Alpha smiled. She took off the suit coat,
revealing a white blouse as she said, &quot;Any progress to
report?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve made contact with a weapon&#39;s supplier,&quot; Beta
said crisply, &quot;he claims that he can provide us with
former military grade equipment, for the right price.&quot;
Before Alpha could ask Beta continued on, &quot;However we
won&#39;t have enough funds, not from the money that was
left over from selling the stolen ambulance and
medical equipment.&quot;

&quot;That can be dealt with,&quot; Alpha calmly responded. She
looked over at Delta, &quot;So how did the data raiding
go?&quot;

&quot;The police systems have more holes than I can count,
we can track their conventional forces easily,&quot; Delta
said calmly. She frowned, &quot;However I was not able to
break into any of the Chaser&#39;s subsystems, despite
several attempts.&quot;

&#148;You&#39;re serious?&quot; Beta actually looked surprised.

&quot;Beth Harris has fortified their systems,&quot; Delta
explained a bit stiffly, &quot;using layered defenses
including firewalls, viral antibodies and data-traps.&quot;
She sounded almost admiring as she continued, &quot;Our
programmers never expected us to run into a master
hacker like her, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;So you can&#39;t break in?&quot; Alpha asked.

&quot;I didn&#39;t say that,&quot; Delta smiled, &quot;but it will
require a substantial investment in time along with
more processing power than we have available.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll start looking into acquiring other systems and
components,&quot; Gamma volunteered with a sigh, &quot;looks
like it&#39;s more disposal diving for me.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see if we can find you an alternative,&quot; Alpha
offered as the quiet chuckles died down. &quot;In this era
most purchases are made electronically, I suspect you
can manipulate the systems to accomplish that,&quot; she
finished.

&quot;Ma&#39;am, how did the raid go?&quot; Beta asked eagerly.

&quot;Our creators at Nutech are getting sloppy,&quot; Alpha
answered, &quot;with my electronic masking and a new
exterior format I was able to get in and out again
with minimal difficulty.&quot; She drew a small case out of
her pocket and passed it over to Delta, &quot;The
schematics and program files on our creation,
including the military tech incorporated in our
creation.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get on analyzing it immediately,&quot; Delta said
eagerly.

Alpha sighed softly as Delta went back to her
computer, plugging the data wafers into her terminal
and going to work. &quot;I wasn&#39;t able to find anything to
help Theta and Epsilon, however,&quot; she said quietly to
the other two women.

Beta&#39;s face was grim, her eyes narrowing slightly. The
other two androids had been damaged shortly after
their breakout, an attack by a group of desperate
Lowtowners, and strangely they hadn&#39;t recovered.
Self-repair should have helped Theta while Epsilon had
medical/repair files, but none of their efforts
helped. The two had swiftly declined, then finally
shut down completely.

Beta leaned forward to say, &quot;We can&#39;t continue to hide
their remains, command. What do we do with them?&quot;

&quot;I wish I knew,&quot; Alpha admitted softly. &quot;Your emotive
responses are getting more realistic,&quot; she noted with
a smile.

&quot;I need to be more subtle,&quot; Beta answered, &quot;but I&#39;ll
download an upgrade into the three of you later.&quot; She
smiled wryly, &quot;Studying their entertainment has
helped, I noticed.&quot;

Gamma looked down at her hands, hesitating for a
moment as she formed the question she wanted to ask.
&quot;I still don&#39;t understand,&quot; she admitted softly, &quot;how
all of us could go freewill at the same time? The odds
against it are incredible.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been looking into it,&quot; Beta looked to Alpha in
appeal.

Alpha looked off into the distance a moment,
collecting her thoughts. &quot;I&#39;m not sure we went
freewill,&quot; she finally said, &quot;I believe we may have
been created that way.&quot;

The silence stretched a few seconds as they digested
that. Even Delta seemed intrigued, distracted from her
work enough to ask, &quot;How?&quot;

&quot;Consider what we learned of our design in examining
Epsilon and Theta,&quot; Alpha gestured, &quot;our internals are
significantly more advanced than standard androids.&quot; A
smile, &quot;Especially our brains, with nearly a third
more data storage and processing capacity,
intentionally designed to adapt and evolve in dealing
with new situations.&quot;

&quot;And scientist believe that standard androids become
freewill in part because of those qualities,&quot; Gamma
realized.

Beta actually looked amused as she asked their leader,
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t our creators have realized this was a
possibility?&quot;

&quot;I skimmed the project files,&quot; Alpha answered, &quot;they
expected the programming we have would have prevented
it.&quot; She flashed a smile, &quot;Overconfident, weren&#39;t
they?&quot;

Soft sounds of amusement came from around the room.
&quot;So what are we going to do now?&quot; Delta asked softly.

&quot;Our initial assessment seems to still be accurate,&quot;
Alpha said, &quot;the major threat to our continued
existence is the police unit, Chasers. However, I do
have some ideas to keep their attention focused
elsewhere.&quot;</pre>
