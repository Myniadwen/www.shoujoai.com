<h1>Mechanical Girl Blues</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The used sports car wove through the hills, out past the edge of the 
small town and to the base of the mountains. The location was chosen 
quite deliberately, intended on one hand to be accessible to cities and 
community, but on the other to be remote and private. She got out of her 
car and used her key to enter the two story house, an almost typical 
looking design from the outside.

The woman strode through the upper floor of the house with easy 
familiarity, reaching the elevator in the center of the building in a 
few moments. A keycard swiped through the reader opened up the door and 
she pressed the button for the sub-basement level as she wondered what 
her research partner and best friend might want. She emerged into the 
lab with a spring in her step only to slow to a stop, gazing at what 
awaited her.

It hung up there in the web of cables and conduits, the steel alloy 
skeleton of what might one day become a human being. From a distance it 
looked just like a human skeleton, it was only as you drew closer that 
you saw the shades of metal alloy and mechanical joints, the segments 
fused together to make the familiar shapes.

&quot;You know, I almost can&#39;t believe you&#39;re doing this,&quot; Heather said in 
awe, her golden hair falling over she shoulders and down to the top of 
her breasts. She wore simple clothes, a plain black skirt and top, but 
carried them off with style.

&quot;Love, I&#39;ve been working for this on paper for years,&quot; Nina softly 
answered. She pushed her wheelchair forward a bit, easily weaving her 
way through the lab equipment over to her partner&#39;s side. Her glasses 
shone in the light, almost as much as the glossy sheen of her brown 
hair, and her white shirt and pants were still spotless.

Heather blushed faintly at the endearment. Nina had been calling her 
things like that for almost as long as she knew her, and she was never 
that sure how to take them. &quot;I didn&#39;t know you were any where near 
achieving physical reality, though,&quot; she commented, circling the 
skeleton thoughtfully, &quot;How will it move?&quot;

&quot;She,&quot; Nina corrected Heather gently. She gestured grandly towards her 
creation as she continued calmly, &quot;I have a hybrid approach in mind, 
using artificially grown tissue accompanied by miniature mechanical 
motors.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going for a human appearance?&quot; Heather raised a eyebrow as she 
cautioned, &quot;You know the scientific community won&#39;t like that.&quot;

&quot;The scientific community,&quot; Nina said frankly, &quot;can go hang.&quot;

Heather chuckled softly, &quot;I love the way you tell it like it is.&quot;

Nina shrugged slightly as she waved, &quot;There&#39;s not a lot they can do to 
me, really. I&#39;m already considered something of an outcast for my 
thoughts on post-humanism.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Heather conceded.

Nina was a thinker as well as a hands on researcher, and part of her 
studies were on the fate of humanity. She had outraged the idealistic 
posthuman movement, a group who believed in artificial evolution of 
humanity, by pointing out that a true posthuman might not be a wonderful 
thing. In fact she had speculated on how regular human xenophobia might 
make a posthuman a threat to his merely human ancestors...

&#39;No, they weren&#39;t happy with Nina,&#39; Heather thought as she looked down 
at her friend thoughtfully, considering how best to ask the next 
question. &quot;You told me about your doctor&#39;s visit,&quot; she started, &quot;is that 
why...?&quot;

Nina rolled forward a bit more, reaching out to touch the smooth metal 
of the skeleton. &quot;Yes, my doctor has confirmed that I can&#39;t have 
children,&quot; she acknowledged the fact calmly, &quot;both my parents are dead 
and my younger brother is gone, too.&quot; A soft sigh, &quot;Yeah, I think part 
of it is just wanting something of me to... carry on.&quot;

&quot;As long as you know that is part of why you&#39;re doing it,&quot; Heather 
smiled at Nina, &quot;that&#39;s the important thing.&quot;

&quot;Always the psychologist,&quot; Nina grumped.

&quot;Well, I have to use my college minor for something,&quot; Heather shrugged, 
feeling a stab of regret for her friend. For as along as she had known 
her, Nina had dreamed of having children, and even after the accident 
that had crippled her from the waist down she had still hoped. Banishing 
the thought Heather gave Nina a smile, &quot;So what can I do to help?&quot;

Nina&#39;s face lit up with a relieved smile, and Heather again was struck 
by how beautiful the other woman could really be. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, 
turning her chair to look up at Heather with twinkling eyes, &quot;I was 
hoping you&#39;d say that.&quot;

Heather chuckled as she remarked, &quot;I don&#39;t know about that look on your 
face....&quot;

&quot;Oh don&#39;t worry,&quot; Nina cheerfully lead the way over to the work benches 
around the outside of the room, &quot;when have I led you wrong?&quot;

&quot;I seem to recall a night in jail,&quot; Heather replied dryly.

&quot;That was a special circumstance,&quot; Nina defended herself, &quot;and we were 
both drunk when I talked you into flashing that police officer.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Heather acknowledged, sitting down on her chair even as 
Nina smoothly slid into place beside her.

&quot;You&#39;ve had more experience than I have in visual design and 
engineering,&quot; Nina said as she used a monitor to call up schematics, &quot;I 
need help in figuring out how to get the sort of look I want for her 
using the systems I&#39;ve already designed.&quot;

Heather felt a stab of pleasure as they both bent over the console, 
looking at Nina&#39;s face lit up by the eagerness of a scientist who was 
happily at work. &quot;I think I can see how I can help,&quot; she agreed, 
reaching out to use the mouse to highlight the skeletal face and how the 
artificial muscles on it were to be configured.

Nina was reaching for the controls, too, and their hands brushed 
together. A faint blush colored her cheeks but Nina was calm as she 
watched Heather smoothly reconfigure the layout to allow realistic 
expressions. &quot;You really are good,&quot; she agreed.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Heather was also blushing.

They worked together for many hours, quickly losing track of time as 
Heather and Nina went over the various designs for the arms, legs and 
upper body, layering simulated flesh over projected musculature to 
create a body that would look as close as possible to a natural human. 
They had a unique way of working together, unconsciously complimenting 
each other&#39;s skills, deferring to the other&#39;s abilities or taking the 
lead when needed.

Finally Nina yawned softly, peering at the time on the corner of her 
computer screen. &quot;You aren&#39;t going to believe the time,&quot; she said 
sheepishly.

Heather stretched her arms above her head, likely unaware of how the 
motion pulled her shirt tightly across her full breasts. &quot;I think I can 
guess,&quot; she rubbed at the back of her neck, &quot;from the crick I&#39;m getting 
if nothing else.&quot; She got up, wincing a little at the stiffness in her 
knees, &quot;So how badly stocked is your fridge?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Nina blinked, diverted from what she had been thinking about.

Heather gave her a fond smile and said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s that or order take 
out.&quot; After saving their work she went behind Nina&#39;s chair and took the 
handles to push her towards the elevator, &quot;Do you want to cook or I?&quot;

&quot;I take it you&#39;re staying over?&quot; Nina asked impishly as they went into 
the lift, rising to the house above them.

Heather chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m inviting myself.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Nina said with another of those flashing grins before continuing 
happily, &quot;then you get to do the cooking.&quot;

&quot;Are you still living on TV dinners and takeout?&quot; Heather asked as she 
gently pushed her out onto the living room floor.

&quot;Hey, I do cook real food occasionally,&quot; Nina protested with as much 
dignity as she could muster. Which wasn&#39;t very much, considering how 
often Heather had been over here and seen the inside of her fridge.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Heather laughed, &quot;when you&#39;re trying hard to impress a date.&quot; 
She opened the freezer first, pulling out the burgers, then retrieved 
onions and tomatoes from the bottom. &quot;How did things work out with the 
last girl you had over?&quot; she asked.

Nina blushed brightly, remembering how Heather had innocently used her 
key to enter and walked in on her and a pretty young thing making out on 
the couch. More exactly the lady had been performing oral sex on Nina, 
while she had gaped in surprise at the equally stunned Heather. &quot;We&#39;re 
not seeing each other any more,&quot; Nina admitted.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen you blush that way,&quot; Heather remarked, a 
blush on her cheek s she put the heat on the stove and dropped two 
burgers in.

Nina rolled over to where Heather stood by the counter, chopping onion 
and tomato, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you had to see that.&quot; She smiled up at her 
hesitantly as she reached out to rest her hand on Heather&#39;s once she 
stopped, &quot;I hope it didn&#39;t make you too uncomfortable?&quot;

&quot;I knew that you were into girls before,&quot; Heather pointed out to her, 
meeting Nina&#39;s warm eyes with her own.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean you weren&#39;t uncomfortable,&quot; Nina said gently.

&quot;No, it didn&#39;t bother me,&quot; Heather said, her voice soft. A faint smile, 
&quot;If I&#39;m going to be honest, I think it was the first time I saw you as a 
sexual being.&quot;

Nina rolled her eyes at that. &quot;I thought I was pretty sexy,&quot; she sighed.

Heather shifted her grip, squeezing Nina&#39;s hand as she tried to explain, 
&quot;It&#39;s not that, it&#39;s just that you&#39;re....&quot;

&quot;Disabled?&quot; Nina asked a bit coldly.

&quot;No,&quot; Heather shook her head firmly, &quot;detached. When we&#39;re working I 
think of how intelligent you are not... your body.&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Nina sighed, but she was still smiling. She looked over 
at Heather impishly, &quot;You mean you never noticed me?&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;m just digging myself deeper here,&quot; Heather sighed. Changing 
the subject she asked, &quot;Have you decided on a name for her?&quot;

&quot;Terri,&quot; Nina said thoughtfully, &quot;I was thinking about Terri.&quot;

&quot;I like that,&quot; Heather said thoughtfully, setting the burgers on a plate 
and carrying them over to the table with buns, condiments and toppings.

&quot;Good,&quot; Nina rolled over beside her. She batted her eyes charmingly and 
asked Heather, &quot;You really didn&#39;t notice me?&quot;

&quot;Nina!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Nina tried to look innocent.

End

Notes: If you&#39;ve read my story &quot;Passing&quot; in Yuri Monogatari II from ALC 
publications, you&#39;ll know who Terri is. I wanted to look into her 
background a bit, as well as trying to write a disabled character. Not 
sure if I was quite successful.... Also added some detail based on 
readers requests.</pre>
