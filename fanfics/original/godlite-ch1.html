Author&#39;s Note:
	This is an update/edit. I changed the opening, and ending, because 
I wanted to change the feel, and part of the mood. It&#39;s been slow for a 
while, but thanks to a comment from Kaiser, I got back to work on this. 
I&#39;d like to hear any comments/critiques from all who read, so feel free. 
Now, on with GL!

***************************
       
       Outside of a Japanese restaurant, deep in the city, stood a 
beautiful woman. She was about 5&#39;8&quot; with the body of a beauty queen and 
bright red-gold hair that fell around her jaw line. Her head was down, 
her eyes hidden from view. After a moment, her hair moved slightly and 
her eyes fell on the door of the restaurant. They were an elegant green 
and filled with sorrow and bitter memories.

----------------------------

       Kara Kinahara sighed as she stood in front of the door to an all 
too familiar restaurant. &#39;*Sigh* I don&#39;t want to do this, but ... I need 
to move on.&#39; She strengthened her resolve, and brushed a loose strand of 
her newly cut hair. Kara took a deep breath, and pushed the door open, 
walking into the finely lit restaurant

       &quot;Ah, it&#39;s good to see you Ms. Kinahara!&quot; Hiragashi said brightly. 
&quot;Should I set your usual table tonight?&quot;

       &quot;Thank you Hideo,&quot; Kara replied, smiling fakely. &quot;That would be 
fine.&quot;

       &quot;Yes, yes,&quot; Hiragashi said bowing slightly. &quot;Right this way.&quot;

       Kara followed Hideo Hiragashi to the all too familiar table in 
her favorite restaurant. She fought back tears as several happy and 
painful memories came flooding into her mind. She now remembered exactly 
why she hadn&#39;t been coming to the restaurant for the past seven months. 
It hurt too much to be here, but she needed to move on. She took her 
seat and thanked Hideo quietly. He returned after a few minutes with a 
drink and asked her for her order.

       &quot;Should I bring your normal order?&quot; Hiragashi asked as Kara took 
her seat.

       &quot;No thanks Hideo,&quot; Kara answered kindly. &quot;I think I&#39;ll try 
something else tonight.&quot;

       &quot;Ok, do you want to order now, or should I return after you&#39;ve 
looked our menu some more?&quot; Hiragashi asked politely.

       &quot;I&#39;d like to look at the menu a bit longer if that&#39;s ok,&quot; Kara 
said returning the polite manner Hiragashi had shown.

       &quot;OK then, I&#39;ll be back shortly,&quot; Hiragashi said giving Kara a 
small bow before turning and walking away.

       &#39;Oh goddess, I wish I hadn&#39;t come back here.&#39; Kara thought 
letting a painful sigh escape her lips. &#39;The memories that are held here 
are just too much.&#39;
   
       Kara continued to curse herself as she gazed at the menu blankly. 
She had hardly read any of the dish selections when Hideo had returned.
   
       &quot;What will it be tonight Ms. Kinahara?&quot; Hiragashi asked pulling a 
small note pad from the pocket on his white coat.

       &quot;I think I&#39;ll try your Unagi and a small sample of the Tempura 
please,&quot; Kara answered.

       &quot;Ah yes, fine choice Ms. Kinahara,&quot; Hiragashi said scribbling on 
the notepad. &quot;I&#39;ll have Mitsuko come and cook for you tonight.&quot;

       &quot;Thank you Hideo, that&#39;s very kind,&quot; Kara began, &quot;but I don&#39;t 
want someone to go through the trouble ...&quot;

       &quot;It&#39;s not any trouble,&quot; Hiragashi said cutting her off. &quot;I&#39;ll 
send her out immediately.&quot;

       &quot;Hideo, please, you don&#39;t have to ...&quot; Kara tried to say as Hideo 
Hiragashi rushed away.

       &#39;Damn, now why wouldn&#39;t he just listen to me?&#39; Kara thought 
wearily. &#39;I wish he would just hear me out for once. I guess that&#39;ll 
happen when hell finally freezes over.&#39;

       Kara sat quietly for a minute or two before she saw Hideo walking 
back towards her. She sighed and closed her eyes and told her self not 
to get angry with the over-pleasant restaurant manager. As she opened 
her eyes, her breath got caught in her throat. The woman following Hideo 
was absolutely gorgeous. Kara stared in awe at the angellic woman 
approached her, behind Hideo. She was about 5&#39;5&quot; or 5&#39;6&quot; with long, 
shining jet-black hair, warm and gentle Honey-brown eyes, soft and 
delicate pink lips, and a body that most women would kill for. Kara 
remained not only breathless, but speechless as Hideo introduced the 
amazingly beautiful young woman and chef.

       &quot;Ms. Kinahara, I would like you to meet Mitsuko Mihoshi,&quot; 
Hiragashi said introducing her. &quot;Mitsuko, this is Ms. Kara Kinahara. You 
will be preparing our special Unagi and a sample of our best Tempura for 
her this evening.&quot;

       &quot;Yes Hiragashi-sensei,&quot; Mitsuko said bowing to Hideo. &quot;I shall 
make a meal she will never forget.&quot;

       &quot;Good, good,&quot; Hiragashi said returning Mitsuko&#39;s bow. &quot;I shall 
leave you then.&quot;

       &quot;Ms. Kinahara?&quot; Mitsuko said facing Kara.

       &quot;....&quot; Kara sat silently staring at Mitsuko.

       &quot;Ms. Kinahara?&quot; Mitsuko said slightly louder.

       &quot;Oh, yes?&quot; Kara replied snapping out the trance.

       &quot;Would you like me to begin now?&quot; Mitsuko asked making small 
motions with her small and flawless hands.

       &quot;Oh, right,&quot; Kara said starting to blush slightly. &quot;You can start 
doing whatever you like.&quot;

       &quot;Ok Ms. Kinahara,&quot; Mitsuko said preparing her cooking 
instruments.

       &quot;Please, call me Kara,&quot; Kara said trying to hide her reddening 
cheeks.
       
       &quot;If that is what you wish,&quot; Mitsuko replied.

       Kara watched in silence as Mitsuko prepared her meal. Kara didn&#39;t 
want to take her eyes off of Mitsuko&#39;s angellic face. She stared on, 
hypnotized by the young chef&#39;s beauty. She couldn&#39;t help but imagine 
pinning Mitsuko down and totally ravishing the young woman&#39;s stunning 
and flawless body. Kara snapped back into reality as Mitsuko&#39;s hand 
grazed hers as the chef placed her plate in front of her.

       &#39;Did she plan that!?&#39; Kara thought excitedly. &#39;Or was it all an 
accident?&#39;
   
       &quot;Ms. Kara?&quot; Mitsuko said sweetly.

       &quot;Yes?&quot; Kara asked in reply.

       &quot;Would you like me to stay here while you eat? To see if the food 
meets your liking, of course,&quot; Mitsuko asked in her honey-toned voice. 
&quot;Hiragashi-sensei told me to do everything you asked of me, and I just 
thought that since you had been staring at me, you&#39;d like me to stay.&quot;

       &quot;Oh,&quot; Kara giggled nervously turning bright red, &quot;that would be 
ok, I suppose.&quot;

       &quot;I will stay here then,&quot; Mitsuko said sitting across from a 
flustered Kara.

       Kara slowly ate the meal Mitsuko had prepared. She closed her 
eyes as the amazing taste overwhelmed her taste buds. She sighed in 
contentment as she finished the last of the well prepared food. Mitsuko 
smiled kindly as Kara sat back in her chair almost full from the 
exquisite meal. As Mitsuko cleared away Kara&#39;s plate, here hand once 
again grazed Kara&#39;s.

       &#39;Okay, she did it again.&#39; Kara thought quickly. &#39;It couldn&#39;t have 
been an accident both times could it?&#39;

       &quot;Ms. Kara, would you like dessert?&quot; Mitsuko asked sweetly.

       &quot;Yes, I would,&quot; Kara replied politely. &quot;And you don&#39;t have to 
call me miss.&quot;

       &quot;Yes, Kara,&quot; Mitsuko replied as she walked toward the kitchen.

       Mitsuko returned quickly with another pot to cook the dessert in. 
She began to pour some unfamiliar ingredients into the pot in front of 
Kara. As a very sweet aroma filled the air, Mitsuko placed a small bowl 
in front of Kara. Once again, her hand grazed Kara&#39;s as she placed the 
bowl.

       &#39;Again!?&#39; Kara&#39;s thoughts showing on her face. &#39;That most 
definitely wasn&#39;t an accident.&#39;

       &quot;Here is your dessert Kara,&quot; Mitsuko said as she poured the 
simmering confection into the bowl. &quot;Would you like me to sit here while 
you eat again?&quot;

       &quot;If you wouldn&#39;t mind, of course,&quot; Kara replied innocently.

       &quot;It isn&#39;t a problem,&quot; Mitsuko replied sweetly.

       &quot;Thank you Mitsuko,&quot; Kara said looking at Mitsuko and smiling.

       &quot;You are welcome Kara,&quot; Mitsuko replied smiling back.

       Kara reached for her chopsticks, but grabbed a spoon instead. She 
filled the spoon and blew lightly on her steaming dessert. Once again, 
her taste buds were overly pleased with the flavor and texture of the 
sweet confection. Kara only closed her eyes and savored the taste. She 
placed her spoon down for a moment and looked over at Mitsuko.

       &quot;Does it not please you?&quot; Mitsuko asked, worried.

       &quot;Yes, it pleases me,&quot; Kara said slowly, &quot;but, it&#39;s too good to 
eat quickly.&quot;

       &quot;Wonderful!&quot; Mitsuko said, clapping her hands joyfully.

       &quot;Yes, wonderful,&quot; Kara said gazing into Mitsuko&#39;s welcoming eyes.

       &quot;Ms. Kinahara?&quot; Hiragashi said, breaking the silence. &quot;Was your 
meal okay?&quot;

       &quot;Yes, yes it was,&quot; Kara answered honestly, her eyes still focused 
on Mitsuko&#39;s. &quot;I also enjoyed the company of Mitsuko as well.&quot;

       &quot;That&#39;s good; that&#39;s very good to know,&quot; Hiragashi replied 
excitedly. &quot;Mitsuko, you may have the rest of the evening off, if you&#39;d 
like.&quot;

       &quot;Thank you Hiragashi-sensei,&quot; Mitsuko replied standing and 
bowing. &quot;I would like that very much.&quot;

       &quot;You are welcome Mitsuko,&quot; Hiragashi replied. &quot;Do you need 
anything else Ms. Kinahara?&quot;

       &quot;No, thank you very much though Hideo,&quot; Kara replied kindly. &quot;I&#39;m 
fine.&quot;

       &quot;Ok, but ask if you do need something Ms. Kinahara,&quot; Hiragashi 
said bowing.

       &quot;I will take care of everything sensei,&quot; Mitsuko said bowing at 
Hideo once more. &quot;I am glad to serve Kara.&quot;

       &quot;Very well Mitsuko,&quot; Hiragashi said thoughtfully. &quot;Do ask if you 
need help my child.&quot;

       &quot;Yes sensei,&quot; Mitsuko said bowing once more as Hideo walked away.

       &quot;Serve me huh?&quot; Kara quipped.

       &quot;Um ... yes, Kara,&quot; Mitsuko replied blushing slightly.

       &quot;Is that a blush?&quot; Kara said playfully.

       &quot;....&quot; Mitsuko&#39;s face grew hotter, and she giggled nervously.

       &quot;It is!&quot; Kara said, laughing. &quot;I made you blush!&quot;

       &quot;It&#39;s nothing compared to how many times I made you blush!&quot; 
Mitsuko replied, matter-of-factly.

       &quot;Well ... I ... uh ...&quot; Kara said, a blush returning to her 
cheeks.

       &quot;See?&quot; Mitsuko said, folding her arms triumphantly.

       &quot;So,&quot; Kara said, her face still pink, &quot;I&#39;m blushing, it&#39;s not a 
big deal.&quot;

       &quot;Then why&#39;d you make a big deal out of my little blush?&quot; Mitsuko 
asked with a smirk.

       &quot;Because you&#39;ve been so straight faced all night!&quot; Kara said 
quickly. &quot;Especially when you purposely touched my hand three times!&quot;

       &quot;I thought you had noticed,&quot; Mitsuko replied, a mischievous smile 
crossing her face.

       &quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Kara said the playful tone back in her 
voice.

       &quot;Wait and find out,&quot; Mitsuko replied, grabbing Kara and dragging 
her out of the restaurant.

Kaiton&#39;s afterthoughts:
	Was it bad? I hope that you at least enjoyed the first 
installation of my first Shoujo-ai fiction. I&#39;ve writing other fictions, 
but this is my first fiction that focuses solely on lesbian 
relationship(s). Well, more later!

	Please, by all means, R&amp;R; I need it. Oh, and if anyone has the 
time, can I get some beta and proof-readers? Possibly an experienced 
chief editor?
