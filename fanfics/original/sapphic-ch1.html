<pre>Bonnie, meet Kris 

**********

One slap was all it took to shut that alarm clock off. It had been 
ringing for quite some time, but finally Bonnie couldn&#39;t take it 
anymore, and she turned the stupid thing off. Morning was hard for a lot 
of people, especially those who were more of the &#39;night owl&#39; crowd. One 
of those said people just happened to be Bonnie. All you had to do was 
take a look at her room to see what she had been doing all last night. 
Open books laid sprawled across her coffee table, computer desk, and 
over her floor. All were math books, all were thicker than the brain of 
an ox. And all held language so complicated that only the brightest of 
America&#39;s youth understood it. And again, our little Bonnie just 
happened to subscribe to that category. 

Bonnie sighed, moaning slightly, then pulled her head upwards, off the 
comforting pillow it had been laid to. Morning. Monday morning, for 
those who need to be exact. It wasn&#39;t her favourite day, by any length, 
but Bonnie loved the idea that school was going to start anew. Y&#39;see, 
Bonnie was a rare type. Most people her age considered their time for 
bright socializing and music. And while Bonnie was not a hermit, she was 
rather isolated. Because her real passion was for academics. The pursuit 
of knowledge above all else, that was her chosen field in life. But even 
rarer, was the asset that made her stand out from the crowds. She also 
had the amazing gift (or curse) of being astoundingly beautiful. 

Of course, she never regarded herself as such. Never let it be said that 
Bonnie Mitchell was a *vain* hottie. 

Sweeping one stray lock of blonde hair from her eye line, Bonnie leaned 
upright and swung her legs from under her bedspread.  Her bare feet 
touched the ground slowly, knowing that there was a wet patch there. She 
had spilt some soda on the carpet the night before, in a rush to get to 
her computer. She left her comp on during her study session, just in 
case one of her many internet friends tried to contact her via IM. She 
liked speaking to people at night, though she had no idea why. Bonnie 
walked over to the door of her bedroom, and strode  out, giving a quick 
yawn. It had to be about 5.00 in the morning, maybe earlier. It was 
still dark out.  She could see that from the window of her upstairs 
hallway. But it didn&#39;t matter much. As it&#39;s been said, Bonnie wasn&#39;t 
much of a morning gal, but she tended to wake up at this time. The 
blonde-headed teen strode from her bedroom to the neighbouring bathroom, 
and closing the door behind her. She was still tired somehow, and needed 
something to wake her up. 

&quot;A bubble bath.&quot; She said quietly. 

And so that was what she chose.  The young girl cast her sweet eyes over 
to the cabinet overhanging her sink. She took out what she wanted, just 
the bottle that contained the bubble bath mixture. She placed it right 
at the edge of the tub, then went for the hot water pipe, turning it 
around quickly. Out came the stream of lukewarm water that became hot 
water. While the warming stream came downwards, Bonnie took the bottle 
of bubble bath. She poured it in lingering drips, mixing with the water 
and forming bubbles from the point of connection. Once that had been 
satisfied, Bonnie moved to the sink to grab a bar of soap. Just as she 
did, she came to look at herself in the mirror. 

Her gentle, silvery-grey eyes rolled up and down the pane of glass 
enshrouded by metal, observing herself. 

Bonnie&#39;s  soft, creamy cheeks became dark with redness as she began 
removing her clothes. First came the top. She was wearing some navy blue 
&#39;sun &amp; moon&#39; pyjamas. Not very mature, quite the opposite, but it suited 
Bonnie just fine for now.  Working her dainty fingers into undoing every 
button, moving downwards,  the front of her top was completely undone. 
She pulled it away and let it fall from her shoulders and arms, to the 
ground. Bonnie looked away, a furious blush along her pouting cheeks. 
Removal of her top meant the brandishing of her womanly &#39;endowments&#39;. Or 
moreover, the lack of them. 

Unlike other girls in high school, the growth of her breasts remained 
stoic. Aside from the slight outline of flesh that highlighted *very* 
partial growth, Bonnie&#39;s chest remained low to her torso. It was no 
secret that she had the smallest breasts at her school. It was the 
source of a lot of teasing by the other girls, sometimes even her 
friends (though they meant no harm). 

Even though she had gotten used to the usual comments, i.e. &#39;you&#39;re 
flatter than a pancake&#39; and &#39;I&#39;ve seen bigger breasts in a bucket of 
chicken&#39;, she was still self-conscious about her chest. 

Next to come were the bottoms, the lower half of her PJs. She pulled 
them down her thin luscious legs slowly, revealing a flash of her white 
cotton panties, frilly around the edges, the symbols of an actual 
virgin. Bonnie stepped out of them, her small feet touching the coldness 
of the bathroom tiles once more. The last thing to come down were her 
panties. They came off her crotch and legs with even greater ease, 
presenting that crescent-shaped outline of her seductive womanhood, 
gracing the rapidly warming air. 

Bonnie crossed both of her arms over her chest and gazed at the 
reflection in her mirror. She never really classed herself as beautiful. 
It had been told to her many times before (by the male population of her 
street, on a large scale) but she had yet to believe it. But Bonnie&#39;s 
beauty transcended any other. It went beyond the kind of &#39;poster girl&#39; 
routine that women in the media pulled. Bonnie was naturally gorgeous, 
in that she needed no make up, boob job or face lift to look that way. 
She was already there, and it didn&#39;t take much for people to start 
noticing it. Though, she still had this crippling fear of intimacy. It 
was the reason she had never been in a relationship. 

And besides that, her major concern was of her schoolwork. This, of 
course, was good for her parents (what self-respecting parent could say 
that they didn&#39;t want their children to have that sort of mentality) but 
frustrating for the people that were attracted to her. And although 
Bonnie wasn&#39;t noticing them, they were quite a few people that were 
casting her their eyes. 
 
By now, the bathroom was being filled with the scent of wildflowers, 
steam rising as the water of the tub did. Bonnie turned from the mirror, 
then over to the bathtub. She shut off the hot water pipe then added a 
little cold water to balance out the warmth. Once it was hot to the 
point of cooling, Bonnie dipped a toe into the water to check for 
herself. It was soon followed by her entire body. Bonnie climbed in, the 
lower half of her body disappearing in a cloud of scented bubbles, and 
settled. There was a sponge at the side of the tub. She clasped it, 
while her nose and skin adjusted to the sweet smell and soothing heat. 
Once she felt so comfortable it was sinful, Bonnie took the yellow and 
green sponge to her body, running it over her tight flesh. She dipped it 
into the water, soaking it, then brought back out and resumed with her 
actions, gently rubbing the soft article over her body. First to her 
chest. It glided over her undeveloped mounds, leaving behind a trail of 
wetness, that faded away in drips, running down her midriff and back to 
the water. The sponge made its way to her neck, over her collarbone, and 
around the nape, then down her shoulders and arms. Bonnie slipped her 
eyes shut and enjoyed the comforting feel of it. She had always enjoyed 
taking baths like this, it was a sort of guilty pleasure for her. And 
this continued for the better part of an hour, that comfort a welcomed 
alternation from leagues and leagues of book reading. Even though she 
had school soon, it was one of the rare times that Bonnie was hardly 
concerned. It was sensations such as this, that she believed, should 
last forever. 

**********

&quot;What the hell is a workhouse?&quot;

Over, and over, and over again. Dear god, History was one boring lesson. 
Travelling through wave after wave of crusty old books that hardly 
anyone took a gander at. Then you had to read though &#39;um and dig out the 
info that your hard-ass teacher tells you to find. Which took some 
people the better half of a couple hours. What was even worse, was when 
your entire grade depended on one little exam. That made hard work a 
necessity, more so than usual. 

Kris Taylor slapped the pencil in her hand straight to the table, 
sighed, and leaned back on the chair she was sitting in. Not only was 
this boring, it was ridiculously boring. She was a star hockey-player, 
not a historian. Making her do all this was like trying to motivate a 
penguin into flight. This mumbo-jumbo just didn&#39;t fly with her. Or, 
something to that effect. Across her table, a far sterner and more 
dedicated student cast an eye. An eye for the disruption, which, in 
fact, was caused by Kris.

&quot;Kris,&quot; She said. &quot;Stick at it. This exam is really important. You don&#39;t 
want to fail it and blow your chances at a good college, do you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m starting to think college isn&#39;t worth this fuss,&quot; The frustrated 
girl ran a hand through her short wavy black hair. &quot;How many more times 
will I have to cram like this? It sucks. I wanna head down to the rink, 
and take a smack at some pucks.&quot;

&quot;Well, it isn&#39;t going to happen.&quot; The girl replied. &quot;And to answer your 
question, at least partially, go search for it in the glossary of a 
book.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You wanted to know what a workhouse was, right?&quot; 

Kris shook her head slowly. &quot;I really, really need some air.&quot; 

The hockey player stood upright and strode over to the front desk of the 
library. She couldn&#39;t take it anymore. She really and truly needed a 
break from all this stress. And to be perfectly honest, Kris would have 
easily resolved her issues on an ice rink. She loved hockey. She loved 
it with a passion. Being that Saffron-Jameson was a school that took a 
lot of pride in the ability of its sporting teams, Kris often got the 
chance to put her pleasure to practice. But recently, that had all 
changed. Since the finals were coming up soon, time had to be spent on 
study and whatnot. That meant most practice games and real ones were on 
hold. Which also meant that Kris had less of a tool for venting her 
emotions. Ice rinks were  hard to come by in Victoria-Texas, and even 
fewer were teams that played at those rinks. The only options she had 
was to wait for the exams to end. It was a shame, because not all 
schools did this. There was a school,  a couple miles from here, called 
Atlantic High. They had a rink right next to the grounds, and was open 
for access almost all the time. Kris cursed her luck to have come to 
Saffron-Jameson for her educational needs. 

Anyway, she needed to be getting out of here, regardless of the reason. 
Her Chemistry class started up in about three minutes, and her teacher 
had been riding her ass about lateness. The last thing she needed was to 
end up reprimanded in front of the class again. Kris was just about to 
turn out of the library, until a figure whizzed past her. A girl. She 
was in a rush, and she quickly skipped past Kris in her haste, towards a 
aisle between the geography section and the sociology section. The 
dark-haired girl turned in place, whipping her head around to get a 
better look at her. 

&#39;She&#39;s gorgeous...&#39; Kris thought curiously. 

And damn well, she was. A blonde, of shoulder-long hair and medium 
height, and wearing the cutest little get-up Kris had seen yet. A rather 
conservative brown skirt, which was enhanced in allure by the shortness 
of it, a white loose shirt that had been tied up at the front to reveal 
her midriff, and a pair of dark brown shoes, contrasted by the white of 
her socks. Kris couldn&#39;t believe it. Either the girl had terrible dress 
sense, or she knew *exactly* how to illicit a reaction from a girl of 
Kris&#39; orientation. But her clothing wasn&#39;t the only thing on Kris&#39; mind. 
The girl had the most beautiful face. A elfin-like visage, with cute 
pouting cheeks (boasting the slightest tint of pinkish-red), full and 
rosy lips, and a dazzling set of silvery eyes, with a entrancing sparkle 
that immediately caught the attentions of Kris. The mystery girl seemed 
a year or so younger than she was, and from the looks of it, quite the 
little workaholic. The blonde scanned through each of the books in her 
line of vision, one after the other, until she found what she wanted. 
But it was a little bit high, on the edge of the top shelf. The girl 
stretched her right arm upward, forcing herself onto tip-toes. Even so, 
her fingers just barely grazed the bottom of the book, not quite making 
the cut. 

Kris watched with a concealed glee as the stretch of the girl&#39;s body 
made that skirt ride up her ass. She had such perfect form, her cute 
little behind wiggling with every move she made. 

Kris was so drawn by the spectacle, that she just now realized this was 
the perfect time to go and be &#39;Miss Heroine&#39;. The shorthaired girl 
strode over to the blonde girl&#39;s aisle, bracing herself. While the 
blonde continued to struggle, a firmer hand clutched the book that was 
in her sights. Kris smiled as the blonde hottie swung around, casting 
those innocent grey eyes at her. 

Kris was the first to speak between the two of them. &quot;This was the book 
you were after, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

The quiet girl just nodded, saying, &quot;Y-Yes... Thank you...&quot;

There was a moment of silence between the two of them. Kris, at first, 
didn&#39;t notice that she wasn&#39;t speaking, she was just so caught up in how 
hot and petite this girl seemed. That was until the blonde gave a 
longing look over at the library&#39;s front desk. Then Kris realized that 
the girl was waiting for her to move. But rather than doing that, Kris 
remained as she was. The smiling brunette moved her head a little closer 
to the blonde&#39;s.

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen you before. What&#39;s your name?&quot;

The girl turned beet red. &quot;B-Bonnie...&quot;

&quot;Bonnie?&quot; Kris remonstrated. &quot;That&#39;s a pretty little name. I&#39;m Kris. 
Kris Taylor.&quot;

It was then that Bonnie gave her attentions to Kris and not the checkout 
desk. She blinked, giving off a questioning gaze. &quot;Are you on the ice 
hockey team?&quot;

Kris nodded. &quot;Yup. How&#39;d you know that?&quot;

The girl called Bonnie cast her gaze southward, to her shoes. &quot;I-I saw 
you in the school newsletter. They said that you... were one of the main 
reasons that this school has any sports teams right now...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true...&quot; Kris rolled her eyes. She hated the fact that the 
school paper made that story about her. It brought all sorts of 
attention to the hockey team and attracted a bunch of hopeless wannabes 
that knew nothing of the sport. &quot;But, it was nothing really.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; Bonnie&#39;s eyes lowered and fell. Kris couldn&#39;t read that. 
Normally she knew how to read the body language of a girl-into-girls. 
Smiles, up looking eyes and the embarrassed flash of an eyelash was her 
usual ticket with closet girls. With Bonnie, it was like she was stuck 
in the middle. Though she looked up enough, there was no fluttering. It 
was hard to read her. 

Kris decided to back off before she made a mistake. &quot;Well, you might 
wanna get going.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; That was all she said. And she was gone. Bonnie walked over to 
the front desk, and went through the process of checking out that book. 
Kris watched her longingly. Bonnie was so... there was nothing to 
describe her. Kris loved that look she had going on. That vulnerable, 
I&#39;m-ready-to-be-plucked-from-the-tree look. Bonnie&#39;s actions emphasized 
it. The way she absently flaunted that cute figure but gave mixed 
signals. But Kris couldn&#39;t stop staring at her. Then, as Bonnie got her 
book checked out and walked over to the exit. She stopped, then looked 
back over her shoulder, directly at Kris.

The older girl blinked. Had Bonnie stared at her? It was a fleeting 
moment; because Bonnie was gone the next minute. Now Kris was more 
confused than she had been before. But that one little look did change a 
few things... if she was right...  

**********

Bonnie bounded away from the library, down the hall, in short strides. 
What was she... feeling in there? Why was she so uncomfortable in there? 
All she was doing was grabbing a book, then bang, Kris appeared and she 
felt so... what was that? 

She hadn&#39;t the time to think about it. Her class started now, and if she 
was late, she&#39;d probably be held back after class. Bonnie made an 
ill-paced dash for the end of the corridor, ran down the flight of 
stairs,  through the following corridor, into her English classroom. But 
it was too late. By the time she opened the door, the rest of the group 
had been seated. And poor Bonnie was left looking a lemon in the 
doorway. The teacher of said class, Miss Edwards, gave Bonnie a look 
that was less than jolly. 

&quot;Glad you could join us, Bonnie.&quot;

The mild blonde nodded in apology and quickly made her way over to her 
individual desk. Bonnie tried to fade out of attention as the lesson got 
started. She hated being embarrassed by in front of groups. While she 
did this, Bonnie slipped her eyes shut. She just needed to close her 
eyes for a sec, but a rest of the eyes became a snooze. 

**********

&quot;Okay, girls! Hit the showers!&quot;

Kris and the other girls in the gym all nodded and headed for the 
changing rooms. Their coach, the burly woman in the thick tracksuit, 
walked around the room and collected all the balls that had been used in 
today&#39;s gym lesson. Basketball. Kris was the last person to head for the 
changing rooms. She waited at the corner of the echoing room, slightly 
adjacent from a hoop. The girl threw the ball swiftly, using a 
two-handed shot. Though Basketball was not her trademark sport, the 
basketball itself when straight through that hoop, almost effortlessly. 
Kris then sighed, rubbing some sweat from her face. 

They say that women don&#39;t sweat, they glow. But Kris didn&#39;t feel like 
she was glowing. Hell, she was feeling even more ragged than ever. When 
it came to sports, ones she liked or hated, Kris always made sure she 
did her best. Sometimes pushing herself to her maximum limit. That was 
the kind of dedication she presented for sports. It was one of the two 
most special things to her. The other being girls. Both warranted Kris&#39; 
best performance. And both had been giving her trouble recently. And 
that had been heightened the moment that Kris met that girl, about an 
hour ago. 

Bonnie.

Even now, Kris felt her heartbeat speed up. Just from thinking about 
her. About that cute blonde hair, those alluring grey eyes, her innocent 
smile and those magnetic pouts. She was absolutely dazzling. It struck 
Kris as weird that this was the first time they had met though. Granted, 
this was her final year, and Bonnie looked to be at least a year younger 
than Kris was, they should have crossed paths at least once before. 
Saffron-Jameson was a big school, but not that big. 

Kris shook her head, then walked over to the changing rooms as the rest 
of the class had done. She swung open the double revolving doors, and 
ambled over to her bag by the third bench. The brunette was surrounded 
by leagues of teen girl laughter and chatter, but paid no attention to 
it. None at all. It was the usual nonsense,

&quot;Did you hear that Shandi has a new crush?&quot;

&quot;Really? Who for?&quot;

That sort of thing. Kris wasn&#39;t the &#39;gossip&#39; type. In fact, she was very 
different to most of the girls at this school. Whereas most girls her 
age were into fashion and pop, Kris was what you would call ... a 
tomboy. Sports were her main bag, school was not her strong point in any 
other way. Just studying gave her a headache. Even when growing up, when 
the girls decided to grow and manage their hair, Kris was fixed on her 
normal hairstyle, her thin strands of black hair long enough to just 
about cover her ears. It wasn&#39;t just that, either. Even when she was a 
kid, and all the other girls were indoors having tea parties and 
sleepovers, Kris was out in the garden, playing softball with her dad. 
That was the kind of girl Kris was. A tomboy. But, unlike most, she felt 
no shame in being called that. Kris liked who she was, even if it meant 
being isolated from the trendy crowds. 

She took a seat on her bench, and purposefully waited until everyone got 
going. She was feeling sweaty, and needed a shower, so waited. Soon, all 
the girls had gone about their own business, leaving for other classes 
and free periods. Kris heaved another sigh and went inside her sports 
bag, drawing out her watch. It was 10.11, her English lesson started at 
10.30. She had more than enough time to get cleaned up. Kris gave the 
changing rooms one last eye over, to make sure no one was left. There 
wasn&#39;t. 

&quot;Perfect.&quot; She said to herself.  

Kris went over to the shower stalls, that were in a separate room. The 
young woman stood in front of the glass panel of one of them, and began 
stripping down to her bare minimum, her nakedness. They all went, 
falling into a pile around her legs. First the white training shorts, 
then the sports shirt, then the white socks and the sneakers around 
(sensing a pattern yet?). Before long, she was naked loose and free. 
Kris wound her hands around her pert breasts, out of reflex, not shame, 
then walked inside the stall to get a bit wet. Keeping one arm around 
her chest, Kris used the free hand to switch on the flow of water. It 
came down in warm rainfall, bathing a vertically standing girl. Kris 
shut her eyes and looked up, feeling her soft skin being cleansed of all 
the sweat she had cultivated in her Basketball lesson.  

While she showered, Kris took the time to think. But no matter how much 
she focussed her thoughts on her life and how to spend her day, she 
found herself coming back to the issue of that &#39;Bonnie&#39; girl. She was so 
gorgeous, so sweet and dainty. And genuinely innocent, not like some of 
the sluts out there who faked it to get laid. Kris could tell. Bonnie 
was a sweetheart, but it was so hard to read her. Was she presenting her 
feelings when she looked back at Kris? Or was it just a mistake? Was 
Kris just reading too much into it?

The Texan teen opened her eyes and blinked. Though she was doubting 
herself, Kris was seriously thinking that Bonnie could have an eye for 
her. But was that possible? That hot little thing couldn&#39;t really be 
interested in Kris... could she? 

Yet, in counter to that, why not? Kris might have been a tomboy, but she 
wasn&#39;t ugly. Kris Taylor had had many lovers in the past two years, some 
younger than her, most older than her. She was beautiful, with long 
silky legs, thin hips, and moderately sized breasts. Despite her mid 
90&#39;s Demi Moore haircut (or in addition to it, depending on your view), 
her face was a vision of perfection, with soulful dark eyes and pale 
milky cheeks. Kris hadn&#39;t broken any hearts yet, but her powerful looks 
were certainly capable of it.  

&quot;Dammit,&quot; She thought irritably. &quot;Why can&#39;t I stop thinking about her?&quot;

She had to do something to keep herself under control. If she didn&#39;t, 
the next time she saw Bonnie, she might do something stupid like ask her 
out. But it wasn&#39;t easy. Her nipples were already swelling to hardness. 
Just from thinking of her. Maybe just getting some of the sexual 
build-up off her back would ease the situation. Kris hazarded a gaze 
through the steamy glass of the shower stall to see if anyone was around 
again. The coast was still clear. The girl took a deep breath, and set 
about pleasuring herself. 

One hand went to her left nipple. Her longs fingers plucked at it, the 
pink flesh already hard with arousal. Kris closed her eyes as she played 
with it, and breathed in slowly. She rolled the nub between her fingers, 
over and over again, and sunk her down her damp, naked body. It slid 
over her flat stomach and her midriff, then over her vulva. Even now, 
she could feel wetness down there, and it was a little bit thicker than 
the water of the shower.  Kris separated the folds of her womanhood, 
took a deep breath, and began rubbing. Slowly at first, avoiding the 
clit. It got faster, as her hand worked over her crotch with great zeal. 
Ambitiously, she had lubricated her fingers, and so she thrust them into 
herself as best she could, spreading her legs a bit. It was an awkward 
angle to work from, so she arched her back as best she could, tilting 
her head backwards. Kris&#39; hips jerked, while her thumb rubbed the clit 
she had previously avoided. Through all this, her breath quickened, her 
mouth widened, and she released a deep moan, torn from her throat. 

Her cries echoed out around the shower stall, merging with the sounds of 
dripping shower water. But though Kris had chosen to pleasure herself, 
her feelings toward Bonnie were unchanged. And it seemed that no matter 
what would happen, Kris wanted to have the blonde girl do this for 
her...
