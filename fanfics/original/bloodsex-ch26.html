Jess Drake blinked, the thin, slightly rangy looking
woman leaning forward as she studied her companion
closely. Dressed in a simple T-shirt and jeans she
looked tough, especially with the black leather jacket
that she wore.

&quot;It&#39;s haunted,&quot; the young woman said uncomfortably,
her red hair flowing over her shoulders and green eyes
worried.

&quot;I&#39;m no ghostbuster, Miss...?&quot; Jess looked at the
woman pointedly.

&quot;Chris,&quot; she said reluctantly, her little black dress
clinging to her graceful form.

Almost casually Jess made note of her braless breasts
that were pushing against the fabric, a thin waist and
long, smooth legs. Add in the face of a fallen angel
and you had a very attractive looking package. Of
course, this was just the sort of package Jess had
learned to be wary of from bitter experience.

&quot;This isn&#39;t something I&#39;m qualified to deal with,&quot;
Jess said as she finished her drink, then waved to a
server for another.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Circe dropped off their drinks then the
blonde hurried off to serve someone else in the busy
bar.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Chris smiled then looked at Jess. &quot;You
may not be qualified, but the stories I&#39;ve heard say
you&#39;ve had experience with similar things,&quot; she said.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Jess frowned, clearly displeased that the
other woman knew this. &quot;From whom did you hear this?&quot;

&quot;Hunter, actually,&quot; Chris smiled slightly.

&#145;Of course,&#39; Jess thought, &#145;it would be her.&#39; Taking a
deep breath she said, &quot;What kind of haunting,
exactly?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s randomly throwing things around, breaking
objects, that sort of thing,&quot; Chris sighed. &quot;I can&#39;t
even try to sell it to someone else, the ghost just
scares them off.&quot;

Jess weighed her reluctance against the nudging of her
conscience and sighed. &#145;Damn it,&#39; she thought to
herself glumly. &quot;All right, I&#39;ll help,&quot; she conceded,
&quot;when and where?&quot;

&quot;Thank you so much,&quot; Chris reached across the table to
squeeze Jess&#39; hands as she asked, &quot;tonight, maybe?&quot;

&#145;In for a penny, in fort a pound&#39; Jess mentally
sighed. &quot;Sure, just give me the address,&quot; she said,
carefully pulling her hands free.

Chris wrote out the address, passing over the piece of
paper as she sighed happily, &quot;This is a load of my
mind.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not promising I&#39;ll solve this,&quot; Jess cautioned.

Chris smiled slightly as she answered breathlessly,
&quot;Just knowing that I have help makes me feel better.&quot;

Jess smiled back a bit, &quot;Then I&#39;m glad.&quot;

Later that evening and after a stop at her home for a
change of clothes and a cold shower Jess arrived at
the older house in a nice neighborhood. The building
didn&#39;t stand out from it&#39;s sisters, the three story
house with cheery windows looking out onto the street,
but there was a unusual feel around it.

&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; Chris said as she answered Jess&#39;s
knock on the old fashioned wooden front door. The robe
she wore hugged her slim body, low enough that the
rosy swell of her breasts was visible, and it was
equally obvious to Jess&#39; trained eye that she wasn&#39;t
wearing anything under it.

&quot;Right,&quot; Jess said just a bit warily as she walked in
the entrance way. She shrugged off her leather jacket
to reveal a comfortable black tank top, her jeans
black and tight as well. It gave her a dangerous look,
especially with the lack of any makeup or jewelry.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Chris gestured to her unclothed state as they
walked past the kitchen door to the living room, &quot;I
just had to get a shower.&quot;

Jess raised a eyebrow but decided not to argue. &quot;So,&quot;
she asked curiously, &quot;what do you know about the
history of the house?&quot;

&quot;Not much,&quot; Chris admitted as she sat on the couch,
her robe sliding up to her thighs, &quot;I bought it two
years ago after I had a inspector go over it.&quot;

&quot;I did a search online about the property,&quot; Jess said
as she did her best to ignore Chris&#39; near nudity,
though it was a effort to do so, &quot;there was a girl&#39;s
dorm here back around the turn of the century.&quot;

&quot;I take it something bad happened?&quot; Chris asked,
crossing her legs gracefully.

Jess gulped softly. &quot;Yes,&quot; she managed to get out past
a suddenly tight throat, &quot;apparently there was a fire
and several people were killed.&quot;

&quot;Guess I should have done my research,&quot; Chris sighed,
her full breasts bobbing against her wool robe.

&quot;You mind showing me the room?&quot; Jess asked, deciding
it was probably safer to go deal with a ghost than
Chris.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Chris said as she smoothly rose, &quot;follow
me.&quot;

Hips swaying gently Chris led her through the lower
rooms, past a finely decorated den and a nice kitchen
to the stairs. Jess fought back a gulp as Chris walked
up the stairs, her robe swirling to reveal glimpses of
her shapely legs.

&#145;Keep your mind on business,&#39; Jess reminded herself
firmly. As they reached the second floor. Her eyes
narrowed as she felt a crackle of something very like
electricity in the air, a feeling she had long
associated with the presence of the supernatural.

&quot;I always get a chill up here,&quot; Chris confessed
mildly.

&quot;Which room have you seen things happening?&quot; Jess
asked, trying to get a feel for where the forces were
the strongest. The crackling sensation was strongest
up the hall, she noted, but that didn&#39;t necessarily
mean anything.

&quot;There,&quot; Chris pointed to the room at the end of the
hall.

&#145;Bingo.&#39; Jess thought with some satisfaction. Jess
started down the hall, Chris following a bit nervously
behind her.

Chris opened the door but simply stepped aside for
Jess. &quot;Do you mind if I just leave you to it?&quot; she
asked. A weak smile, &quot;This room creeps me out now.&quot;

Jess gave her a searching look, but just saw fear and
nervousness in her eyes. &quot;Of course,&quot; she agreed,
&quot;I&#39;ll come back down when I&#39;m done.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Chris sighed her relief, &quot;and good luck.&quot;

Jess closed the door behind her then looked around at
the deceptively simple bedroom. Like most guest
bedrooms it had a beside dresser, a empty closet,
several stylish lamps and a bed, in this case covered
by a pink bedspread. The lamps provided plenty of
light, but there was still a odd, almost sinister feel
to the room.

&quot;Come out, come out wherever you are,&quot; Jess murmured
as she walked in, her eyes sweeping the corners
warily.

There was a faint scent of flowers in the air, and
what almost felt like a breeze rushing by Jess&#39; cheek.
A empty ashtray rattled suddenly, the noice loud in
the near silence, then it suddenly shot across the
room!

&quot;Shit,&quot; Jess cursed as she leapt back, the ashtray
nearly striking her.

There was a shimmer in midair, a ripple like the haze
off a hot road, then she appeared. Insubstantial,
almost mist like yet clearly a young woman, and ALSO
clearly angry about something. She gestured again and
this time a lamp crashed to the wall, sparks flying.

With a focusing of will Jess summoned her energies,
enough to block any flying fragments. &quot;Damn it,&quot; she
muttered as the girl seemed to wind up to break
something else.

&quot;Would someone please LISTEN to me?&quot; the ghostly girl
cried out in anguish.

&quot;I would have an easier time listening,&quot; Jess shot
back, &quot;if you&#39;d stop throwing things!&quot;

&quot;You can hear me?&quot; the ghost girl looked at her in
shock.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jess said, even though she was a bit
surprised she could do it too.
