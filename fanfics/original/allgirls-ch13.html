Unfortunately for the students in Ms. McGowen&#39;s class, their loveably 
eccentric teacher had gone and done something rather unwise the day 
before she was scheduled to instruct her pups in the art of discovery: 
she had gone and seen a movie, and it had gotten to her so and found 
root in her brain (skull and all) that, regrettably for the young 
ladies, she emulated many a traits of some of the wickeder characters. 
And of course, the madness had also stricken her to hum the 9th of 
Beethoven rather loudly. She was repulsively happy and it showed when 
her voice throbbed and when her smile became apparent that very day.

&quot;What&#39;s the good word, my droogs?&quot; she asked loudly upon entry. A few 
were stricken, and some knew exactly what she was talking about, and so 
snickered and answered.

&quot;Fine, fine.&quot;

&quot;There exists a quaint happiness today,&quot; she reported, and continued 
humming the 9th. More began to see her motive, but no moods were relaxed 
and certainly, no guards were a-dropped. They were all like strands of 
wheat spaghetti that had not been cooked long enough.

&quot;Well,&quot; resumed dear Emma, her mind aghast with gid, &quot;we shall continue 
our teach if someone can give us a note of their viddilikins. Tell me, 
was my speech proper on the eve of yesterdiddly?&quot;

&quot;Miss... McGowen?&quot; Emma grinned and took a bow. Though weird through and 
through, not having hardly enough sanity to be taken seriously, Em 
McGowen was harmless and gentle&#151;like a creepy barn owl or a fuzzy 
caterpillar from alien lands. She wriggled and gave a morphing wink.

&quot;Ho, ho, ho... it appears I&#39;ve tickled Usha&#39;s nerves. Dear, pay 
attention; my lesson&#39;s a strict one today, loopy. Do reach behind and 
grab that textybook, will you?&quot; Somehow, the ladies interpreted her talk 
and found their books and the proper page. McGowen nearly sang the Ode 
to Joy right there in the class as she waited.

&quot;I had been to the theater once,&quot; she said to herself. The class didn&#39;t 
know what to think or say.

&quot;Ms. McGowen?&quot; asked Blake. &quot;Uh, you okay? You&#39;re starting to sound 
batty.&quot;

&quot;No mind, googly. Page 53. I&#39;ll check your namesies.&quot; She did, out loud: 
&quot;Blake Baum, Erica Fox, Victoria Grisson, Olivia Johnson, Zane Klein, 
Vai Knox, Usha Krishnan, Corona Marcos, Kathlyn Parkin, June Tramble, 
Mira van Dijk, X Walker, Rai Zanders. Presently engrossing our 
experience, all? To what do I owe this extreme pleasure?&quot;

&quot;We just didn&#39;t wanna miss another fun-filled day in your class,&quot; spoke 
X Walker. McGowen smiled and seemed, slowly, to go back to normal. It 
seemed that as long as her students spoke to her normally and helped get 
her out of her funk, she would resort back to&#151;well, it would still not 
be normal, but it would be B.A.U. for Em. The girls spread this good 
word once they realized the trick to it all and hoped for success. 
McGowen wouldn&#39;t have time to think of nonsense if her pups kept her on 
track.

&quot;Our lessy-son paid its vids to the filing system developed some 
odd-years ago,&quot; she began. &quot;O my sisters, whom amongst you can tell me 
of what I speak?&quot; A few, more than a few, hands were raised to the 
ceiling. She picked one at random.

&quot;The classification system originated some 150-odd years ago to 
appropriate every species inside a niche,&quot; and this was said by Olivia 
Johnson.

&quot;Superb. And what are the classifications of this system? Somebody 
else?&quot; She picked Kathlyn Parkin.

&quot;Uh... family... order... class... uh, kingdom?&quot;

&quot;In order?&quot; tested Em. The class became dreadful with silence. Few could 
remember the system; seldom could remember it in order. Well, Usha 
could, but...

&quot;Domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, species.&quot; The 
room became hush with admiration, and heads turned to see a flush miss 
Vicki.

&quot;Excellent!&quot; said McGowen proudly. &quot;But how did you memorize it?&quot;

&quot;Uh... the same way I memorized the names of the seven dwarves: I just 
said all the names really fast, over and over again, until it developed 
into a rhythm.&quot;

&quot;A rhythm?&quot; asked the teacher, boldly intrigued. &quot;Explain.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; resumed Grissom-named-Victoria, &quot;whenever I have a list of names 
or numbers I need to memorize, I just keep repeating them like a cheer. 
Eventually it gets stuck in my head. Ms. Keeping has said that people 
can memorize up to seven consecutive numbers; I assumed this applied to 
names as well.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said McGowen boldly. &quot;I thank you for your time and answer; 
however, I must stop now since this is not psychology class and we are 
here to study science&#151;particularly the science of biology and genealogy 
during this period. Thank you. I would like for all of you to memorize 
these names, using Victoria&#39;s method if you&#39;d want, because I&#39;ll have a 
test on it ready by Friday. Now don&#39;t groan.&quot; Of course, they had, but 
at least McGowen had gotten out of her funk.

Emma&#151;or Em McGowen, as she was more commonly known&#151;was a semi-infamous 
teacher in Stanton, one of the few whom even freshmen knew of, and a few 
seniors still dreaded. She was by no means cruel (although extremely 
unusual), and seldom did anything out of utter senselessness, but to say 
that she was an &quot;interesting&quot; soul would put it mildly. She was quite 
petite for her age, barely taller than most of the youngest girls in her 
classes, but her charm and wit and personality gave her stilts.

Em had a healthy tan, a wardrobe drenched with wit and style, and very 
curly hair tied back in a strict ponytail that was never out of place 
while on duty (and seldom at play). The woman knew her stuff, no doubt, 
and had given lectures across the country during the summers when school 
was out. She was not only smart, but wise too, and quite charming if a 
person was the right age and demeanor. The woman was wealthy, but loved 
teaching more than retirement, and it gave her a good challenge every 
day, which was by far (to her) more important than some dollar bill.

Unfortunately, Em was unpredictable&#151;but many people knew this and braced 
for the worst. They knew better than to point out her size&#151;she was 
especially sore about that&#151;and she was usually too bitchy, impatient, or 
obsessed with her work to hold more than a few minutes of conversation. 
Her tests were ruthless (Madsen&#39;s methods were lukewarm at best in 
comparison) and her experiments, though entertaining, reflected her 
eerie obsession with the Things That Should (simply) &quot;Not&quot;.

And to top it all off, she had a lover right there in that school, 
though only one other person knew it. And they certainly would not tell.

&quot;Today,&quot; Em said later that very same class hour&#151;no longer in her funk, 
having discarded it for her greatest love and infatuation&#151;&quot;We shall 
study blood! Big, thick, drippy, gooey, smothery chunks of white and red 
cells! BLOOD!!!&quot; X and Zane looked thrilled as their smallish instructor 
lavished on the whole &quot;gory details&quot; since it was just their kind of 
thing (Aintzane had said more than one morbid time that if the soccer or 
fashion world would not take her, the cardiovascular sciences would), 
but everyone else was disturbed. They wondered if it would be their 
ownblood they&#39;d study; Zane hoped it would be. That scrape she had 
gotten yesterday would be the perfect source.

&quot;Uh, excuse me, Miss McGowen,&quot; interrupted Erica softly, &quot;but... uh... 
we aren&#39;t studying our own blood, are we?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; sang McGowen warmly, giving the young girl an assuring 
smile. &quot;I&#39;d be in trouble if I stuck needles in your arms. No, we&#39;ll be 
studying some that was recently donated to us. Some of this is the blood 
of criminals, soooo watch out!&quot;

&quot;Cool!&quot; exclaimed Walker giddily. Most of the other girls just paled. 
McGowen produced enough microscopes from the science room closet for 
everyone to share one with somebody else (their pre-assigned lab 
partners for the month), and since there was an odd number of students 
in her class, she put herself with whoever had been left out of the 
loop.

Since the partnerships were random and scheduled to change every week, 
it was interesting to see how people got along. Olivia, Blake, or 
Victoria would be good for each other due to their friendships, but 
putting Mira and Usha together might not&#39;ve been wise. Their political 
rivalry had started well after the assignments were placed, thus proving 
an interesting look at how two people who were running against each 
other in the campaign would work together. It was definitely something a 
few girls wanted to see happen in the outside political world: would 
Bush and Kerry have been bad lab partners?

For the most part, the lab partners were mixed well without too much 
strife. Whoever had been tagged with Klein and Walker were pretty much 
assured a good grade for that experiment; those stuck with people 
ignorant in scientific affairs had to cope. Fortunately, McGowen eagerly 
helped wherever she could, giving special attention to her own lab 
&quot;partner&quot;.

&quot;Look at all those chemical compounds that make up that little red 
cell,&quot; she said to Corona, who had lucked out as the thirteenth student. 
&quot;You know why it&#39;s red, right?&quot;

&quot;Hemoglobin.&quot;

&quot;Correct. Can you name three things the blood cell carries?&quot;

&quot;It carries oxygen, glucose, and wastes for excretion.&quot;

&quot;Good. Now, for bonus points: how long do they live?&quot;

&quot;A... hundred days, I think.&quot;

&quot;Close.&quot;

&quot;A hundred... ten?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re guessing.&quot; Corona frowned. &quot;It&#39;s all right. It&#39;s a lot to 
remember.&quot;

&quot;A hundred-twenty,&quot; murmured Aintzane to Vai, her partner. Vai nodded, 
as she had known that as well. Zane looked more interested in the cell 
itself rather than its statistics; Vai just wanted to get away. Blood 
was not her forte, it was not her thing. She awaited other pursuits and 
tried to endure Zane&#39;s optimism.

&quot;You&#39;re quite amazing,&quot; Usha had to admit to her partner. &quot;I did not 
believe you were capable... What I mean is, you must forgive me for 
thinking so ill of you. I just feared that a person who appeared to have 
no political agenda or ambition would not be a worthy opponent, and I&#39;ve 
heard tell you&#39;re not the type to work hard or even that well.&quot;

&quot;Bad rumors,&quot; growled Mira van Dijk angrily. She busied herself with 
writing notes so she wouldn&#39;t have to put all her focus on her partner&#39;s 
words.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sure some are distorted...&quot;

&quot;And your thoughts on me?&quot; she snorted. Usha frowned and gave Mira a sad 
face. She had clearly insulted the younger girl and was feeling 
miserable because of it.

&quot;Please, forgive me. I didn&#39;t mean to sound rude. I... merely wished to 
express my respect towards you. Your aptitude towards the sciences has 
me in awe.&quot; Mira scowled, but gave a haphazard shrug and resumed peeking 
through the scope. Krishnan sighed.

&quot;I know that if you put yourself to the task, I will be in great danger 
of losing my position as president,&quot; she attempted, her best at 
flattery. &quot;A few people from Ms. Madsen&#39;s class told me about your 
report, and I must say, even I would not go to such lengths. You have 
me, Miss van Dijk.&quot;

&quot;Mira.&quot;

&quot;Forgive me&#151;Mira.&quot; Mira blew out steam, stopped her busy work, and gave 
Usha a study. The woman was obviously upset and wanted to amend her 
ways&#151;she definitely had more honor than most politicians.

&quot;Watch out, Yusha,&quot; she said, trying her best to pronounce the girl&#39;s 
name correctly (Usha looked like she enjoyed the incorrect version). 
&quot;With such an attitude, you may lose. You don&#39;t fight dirty?&quot;

&quot;No, I do not. If I must lose, I wish to lose to a worthy opponent. I 
shall never reduce myself to a slur campaign.&quot; Mira gave her a crooked 
smile, almost sneaking in a bit of charm with it.

&quot;Then you won&#39;t get far in politics. But I respect that. I will do my 
best to meet your hope.&quot; She nodded and resumed making notes, the 
scientific side of her mind advancing past her rival&#39;s. Usha smiled and 
even blushed a little, and also resumed her work.

&quot;Look at the happy couple,&quot; murmured Vai to herself. Zane had long ago 
tuned out everything that wasn&#39;t goopy and red.

When class ended, the girls split up and went their own way. Usha just 
had to stop Mira one last time and apologize, but Mira had forgiven her. 
She even told her she shared the respect Usha gave her. Krishnan had 
earned it; Mira would have to work really hard if she really wanted to 
win. The girls parted on good terms, and then Mira spotted her Motive of 
the Day walking to her locker. Blake Freda Baum stopped to spin the 
combination lock, thus giving van Dijk a great opportunity. She walked 
near the smaller woman and stood waiting, a pleasant smile on her face 
and Sailor Pluto on her shirt.

&quot;Uh, yes?&quot; said Blake as she noticed her visitor. Mira gave a 
fully-confident grin and waved.

&quot;Hi! You are Blake Baum, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and you&#39;re Mira van Dijk. We&#39;ve got some classes together.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes. I heard from your friend that you would like a girlfriend. I 
too would like a girlfriend. Maybe we can help each other out? Would you 
like to be my girlfriend?&quot; Her face as red as her hair, Blake quickly 
shut her locker, clasped her books to her chest protectively, and 
faltered.

&quot;Uh, heh... Subtle, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;What does that mean?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re awfully direct,&quot; she remedied. Mira frowned innocently.

&quot;That is bad? I just heard that you never had a girlfriend, and since 
I&#39;d like to have one, I just thought...&quot;

&quot;So, just like that?&quot; Mira nodded, making Blake laugh weakly. Either 
Mira was unusually confident or na&iuml;ve&#151;either way, her bluntness took 
Blake off her guard. It was true that she was interested, and probably 
up to the point of being desperate, but even this was too sudden.

&quot;Who told you?&quot;

&quot;Pretty dark-skinned girl. Uh... damn, forgot her name. Liv?&quot;

&quot;Olivia,&quot; groused the Jew. &quot;That&#39;s unlikely. I&#39;d&#39;ve figured Gab or 
Jeanie would try to set me up with someone, but not Liv! Well, I guess 
we could give it a shot&#151;I mean, I&#39;m in no position to refuse, and I 
guess I wanna get to know you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, goodie!&quot; Mira nearly broke poor Blake&#39;s body in half when she 
leaped over to hug the smaller girl. She got the wind glomped out of 
her, that was for certain. To make matters worse, once Mira&#39;s joy had 
calmed, the taller girl walked away with a wave just as carefree as 
before.

&quot;Whoa, wait!&quot; shouted Baum. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to give me your number so 
we can call each other and arrange dates or something? I mean, I don&#39;t 
know how it works, but I&#39;ve seen it long enough to know.&quot;

&quot;Oh! I am sorry!&quot; Poor Mira kicked her ignorant self and walked back 
over to her new girlfriend, scribbling seven digits quickly on a paper. 
Blake did the same and they both exchanged numbers, and Mira hugged her 
unexpectedly once again before leaving.

It took Blake a long time to realize that finally, she had a girlfriend.

Wow.

............

O the sun was not shining, my friends, on that dreadful Thursday 
morning, nor were the clouds weeping; but they became still and gray, 
darker, and the sky turned murky white like bitter miso soup and 
remained thus until the evening. It was a terrible day and though 
nearing the end of a week, nothing really good seemed to come of it, at 
least from the weather. One girl believed herself pitted inside a chasm 
of darkness and became bleak on the inside and out; she hated herself 
and everything around her, and would&#39;ve turned to suicide if her body 
allowed it. But no, God chose her to suffer more&#151;hell before Hell, it 
seemed.

Vairocana Knox was not in Torvald&#39;s language class, and she was not 
friends with anyone in there, nor was she friends with anyone else; she 
had no one. Once, long ago, when innocence still found its way to her 
body, she was happy, just once. It had been the best week of her life 
and she still looked upon that seven-day period with deep longing and 
fondness. She had came out and revealed her True-Self that week; nothing 
hid her from everyone, and there was great love and acceptance, and many 
people had written her letters showing their care. Those persons were 
gone and away, probably forgetting their one-time friend for others, 
perhaps less worthy. Even that older woman she had loved, who she 
proudly called sister, was gone in obscurity.

Now, Vairocana Knox, in her final year of high school, sulked miserably 
as things crashed further down for her and darkness covered her land. 
She desperately wanted to go away from everything, but she was 
trapped&#151;perhaps forever, a flare never meant to burn. She was ash now 
and would have wept if she could have, but she could not produce tears. 
She sat and watched as people came out of Torvald&#39;s class, some of them 
quite happy-looking. They had love, she did not.

In all the happy programs, movies, shows, cartoons, plays, and 
productions, it was people like her, the ones thrust into the murk, who 
got the most love. There was always some person wounded internally who 
became distant and lonely, and always some person (usually a girl, she 
noted) who came over to them and, with a little effort, pushed them back 
into society. Then they had no more problems and lived the rest of their 
days in happiness. It was such a clich&eacute; and such a lie that the whole 
idea was sinful. Things like that simply did not exist in the real 
world, if indeed the world was real.

Vai knew the names of most of the girls in Torvald&#39;s class, because she 
shared other hours with them and knew them by the way they acted. Ayanna 
Montgomery came out, so spunky and energetic and fun. Out came Farrah 
Kwong, intolerant of the rampant Sapphic overtones that seemed to seep 
through Stanton. There came Ivory, her wild friend; out came Usha, the 
political; Lilian, the withdrawn; Walker and Klein, the sports jocks; 
out came Nomi Nakatori, the humble musician, and apparently the girl who 
had her eyes on her, Alisha Fox&#151;also inclined to good song.

Vairocana sighed. Even her mothers had begun neglecting her, as they 
seemed more and more absorbed in their work and life. Few people had 
ever come about as mentors and instructed her on how to make friends; 
nobody told her how to cure lovelessness. She was alone and 
inexperienced, perhaps even shy, and hated herself so much for it. She 
had tried, in desperation, the pull of the church, but that failed: she 
just felt even more alienated and lonely. And she had two mothers.

Vai herself wasn&#39;t gay, lesbian, or straight; she just wanted love, no 
matter where it came from, but as she had very rarely gotten it in her 
short life, how would she give it or even know it? So far, all her 
prayers for friends went unanswered-- the God she prayed to was a 
silent, indifferent, cruel deity who apparently liked to see her suffer 
and took great care to exempt her from all the mercy and love otherwise 
promised. And He, or &quot;he&quot;, certainly wasn&#39;t always with her.

She moved to her next class, constantly wondering what the point was in 
caring or trying. She began to feel ill and decided to call in sick for 
Friday. Maybe if she started bleeding, vomiting, or wasting away, her 
mothers would at long last give her some attention. Then again...

In a fantasy world, Emma McGowen would&#39;ve been watching Vai and would&#39;ve 
understood her pain, and would&#39;ve went out and comforted her or at 
worst, sent her to someone she knew would be better-suited. McGowen 
didn&#39;t even see Vai, though; she was sadly preoccupied with Torvald, and 
waited patiently, through all her classes and studies, for the school 
day to end. It took hours. When her last class let out and the burden of 
many jobs rolled off her back freely, she sighed and stalked towards the 
Foreign Language room. A.T. was inside, cleaning up and taking some time 
off for peace before heading home. Em knocked.

&quot;See you at &#39;ome, luv,&quot; she called in a bad Cockney accent. Andeira 
barely noticed her presence or registered her voice before she had left. 
She shook her head and wondered, after four years of acquaintanceship, 
why she still could not understand the petite woman. She left her 
classroom after thirty minutes and drove home, having some ways to go 
before she caught up with McGowen.

She got to her apartment quietly and let out a breath. She walked up the 
stairs and produced her keys. The door opened. Emma McGowen was on the 
other side, cheerful and still dressed sharp. She greeted Andeira with a 
big, surprising hug, and pulled her inside where their activities would 
be hid. But Andeira was not in the mood, and distanced herself from 
McGowen still. Em had to note that these moodless days and nights were 
becoming frequent; the spark had gone (or gone again) from Torvald&#39;s 
smile, and Em wanted it back. She slinked her way over to where the 
older woman sat glumly, descended down to share the cough with her, and 
began gently gnawing on her ear.

&quot;I&#39;m not in the mood,&quot; repeated Andeira.

&quot;Mmm, what&#39;s wrong? Wanna talk?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just not.&quot; Em pouted.

&quot;I thought about you all day.&quot;

&quot;Stop.&quot;

&quot;If you really want me to&#151;&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Em grunted.

&quot;Oh, all right. I&#39;ll make dinner.&quot; She then left for the tiny kitchen, 
leaving Andeira to sigh and sink further into the couch. It was like all 
the energy had been drained from her body&#151;like her soul had been removed 
again&#151;and it would take more than Emma&#39;s gentle care this time to help.

Outside, the sky relented and wept.</pre>
