Hearts Intertwined

The sun shone down on a small town, playing hide and go seek with the 
clouds, as young grade schoolgirls could be seen walking towards school. 
One small, teenaged, girl in particular happily skipped along the curb 
easily balancing on the edge without a thought in the world, her long, 
golden blonde, hair flowing behind her, and her skirt, bouncing with 
every step. She rounded the corner waving to at a passing group of girls 
along the way. Ahead of her she saw another girl, around the same age, 
with long red hair standing at the corner of the street. This girl 
seemed to be too busy staring at the ground to notice the world passing 
by.

&quot;Hey, Morning Kim!&quot; The blonde yelled out, waving to her friend. 

The bounce in Natalie&#39;s step rapidly faded as her friend lifted her head 
up to revealed a dark black bruise over her right eye and she stopped in 
her tracks, &quot;Morning Nat...&quot; Kim said as she tried hard to force herself 
to smile and pretend like she didn&#39;t notice the way her friend was 
staring at her.

&quot;Kim...&quot; Natalie felt all the happiness within her wash down the sewer 
drain at her feet. In the past few years that Natalie had known the 
redhead the girl she would to show up with a bruise or two, claiming 
that she fell on the way home. Recently, Natalie found out otherwise and 
seeing the depth of the sadness in her friend&#146;s eyes was eating away at 
her heart. &quot;What happened...?&quot; She asked bluntly, however she already 
knew what the answer would be. 

&quot;It is nothing...&quot; Kimberly said as she turned away from Natalie&#39;s gaze, 
&quot;I... I just fell in the tub...&quot; 

&quot;Bull...&quot; Natalie finally had enough of the dancing around the subject. 
Everyone in school knew the truth, but no one knew what to say about it. 
Today, Natalie had enough of pretending like nothing was wrong, &quot;You are 
the worst liar there is, and everyone can see through it, but they 
refuse to say anything.&quot; She was shaking with anger. 

Kim flinched at her friend&#146;s sudden burst of anger, &quot;Natalie, really 
it&#39;s nothing.&quot; She had seen that look in Natalie&#39;s eyes before and 
usually it was just before someone was laying on the ground after 
picking on Kim, or anyone else for that matter. 

&quot;No, it is not nothing!&quot; Natalie was truly angry and hatred could be 
seen in the girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have allowed this to continue for 
so long.&quot; Natalie stormed past the redhead towards the apartment 
building that stood behind Kimberly.

&quot;Wait! Nat what are you doing?!?&quot; Kim tried to grab for her friend, but 
Nat dodged out of reach. Fear rose up in Kim as she chased after her 
friend who was already at the stairs that spiralled the balcony halls of 
the three-floor building.

&quot;I&#39;m going to have a word with that father of yours.&quot; Natalie snarled as 
she began to mount the stairs. Natalie may only have been thirteen years 
of age and under five feet tall, but she held a strength that has been 
known to cause even an adult to back down.

The two girls reached the third floor and Natalie didn&#39;t pause as she 
made a left turn down the walkway to the apartment that Kim called home, 
with the redhead close behind her. Kimberly was visibly terrified, 
nevertheless she stayed close to her friend&#39;s side as Natalie stopped at 
the door labelled &quot;Harrison&quot; and knocked hard, tapping her foot 
impatiently as she waited for a response.

&quot;Just a moment.&quot; Came a soft voice and the door opened to reveal a tall 
thin woman with beautiful white skin and short reddish brown hair that 
had been recently trimmed and a long yellow dress with a white apron 
tied around her waist, &quot;Why, hello Kim and Natalie. Did you forget 
something?&quot; Mrs. Harrison said looking between the two girls as she was 
busily drying her hands on the apron.

Natalie began to open her mouth when the woman moved to push her hair 
over her ear causing her sleeve to fall down, exposing a dark bruise 
mark in the shape of fingers around her wrist. Natalie tried to fathom 
how hard someone would have to grab a person&#39;s arm to make that kind of 
mark,  &quot;I...&quot; Natalie glanced up into the woman&#39;s eye then back at her 
friend&#39;s to see the same fear in both of them. Natalie turned back to 
Mrs. Harrison as she quickly pulled her sleeve back down to once again 
cover her arms, &quot;I was wondering if I could get a drink. I ran most of 
the way here and am thirsty.&quot; She asked tentatively. Kimberly let out 
the breath she was holding. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Mrs. Harrison turned away from the door to enter the small 
kitchen that was right next to the entrance. The sound of the fridge 
door opening could be heard and her voice lingered from within, &quot;Will 
orange juice do? I still need to get more groceries.&quot; She asked. 

&quot;That would be great.&quot; Natalie replied. 

&quot;Kim dear, you want anything as well.&quot; The sounds of glasses being moved 
around in the cupboard drifted along with her mother&#146;s voice. 

&quot;No, that is alright mom.&quot; Kim answered, &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; 

Kim&#39;s mother returned with a small glass of orange juice in her hand, 
&quot;Here you are.&quot; She handed the glass to Natalie with a smile, &quot;It sure 
is getting hot out lately hasn&#39;t it.?&quot; 

Natalie nodded, &quot;Yeah it has... Thanks.&quot; She drank the juice quickly 
then wiped her mouth with her sleeve before she handed the glass back to 
Mrs. Harrison, &quot;We should be getting to school or we&#39;ll be late.&quot; 
Natalie said softly. She was not sure why she was talking so quietly but 
she felt that she needed to for some reason when near Kim&#39;s apartment. 

&quot;Well have a good day at school.&quot; Mrs. Harrison said with a smile, 
almost as if there was nothing at all wrong with the world or the fact 
that she and her daughter always seemed to be bruised. 

Kim&#39;s mom waved to the girls as they began to walk away. When Natalie 
stopped and turned around, &quot;Mrs Harrison..?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; The woman stepped out onto the balcony path. 

&quot;Would it be alright if...&quot; Natalie ran a hand through her hair, &quot;If I 
stayed the night?&quot; Kim stared at her friend in disbelief. No one has 
ever asked to stay over at her house before. More so since the incident 
that forced her family to move once again.

Kim&#39;s mother smiled at the girl, &quot;Sure, would you like to stay for 
dinner too?&quot; She asked. It almost looked as if the colour in her face 
brightened at the idea of her daughter having a friend over for the 
night. 

&quot;I have a gymnastics class after school but I&#39;ll try to make it on 
time.&quot; Natalie said with a grin. 

&quot;Kim,&quot; Mrs. Harrison turned to her daughter, &quot;I&#39;ll need you to pick up a 
few things when you get home from school then. So can you make sure 
you&#39;re here as soon as possible?&quot; 

&quot;Ummm...&quot; She glanced from her mother to her friend and back to her 
mother again, &quot;Al.. Alright...&quot; 

&quot;Good, then it&#39;s settled.&quot; Mrs. Harrison said clapping her hands 
together, &quot;I&#39;d better get to cleaning the house then. You two get going 
to school now.&quot; Before the girls could turn around Kim&#39;s mother was back 
in the apartment, closing the door.  

Kimberly blinked at her friend, &quot;What just happened?&quot; she stood 
dumbfounded. 

&quot;I decided.&quot; Natalie said with her eyes closed.

&quot;Decided what?&quot; Kim asked.

Natalie opened her eyes and looked into Kimberly&#39;s, &quot;That I will never 
let anyone harm you again. I&#39;ll protect you no matter what. I promise.&quot; 
She did not take her eyes off the other girl as she spoke. 

Kimberly felt her face redden, &quot;I...&quot; she could not find the words to 
speak. 

&quot;Come on...&quot; Natalie said as she headed back down the stairs, &quot;We are 
going to be late for school.&quot; She smiled up at the redhead and something 
within her moved. Natalie grabbed her chest making sure that Kim didn&#39;t 
notice. For a moment she closed her eyes and when she opened them again 
everything was all right. 

The two girls ran the rest of the way to school, arriving just as the 
final bell rang out. 

                              ***

Gymnastics practice was demanding on Natalie as usual. Her coach was 
pushing her harder and harder with each day. The school competition was 
just around the corner and they needed their best girls in top form, 
which meant that Natalie would be feeling it for the next couple of 
months. Natalie walked along the sidewalk and stretched. For some reason 
she was feeling more then the normal aches and pains that she had grown 
accustomed to. It felt almost as if someone had hit her hard in the side 
during practice, but she didn&#39;t remember anything like that happening.  

She looked down at her watch and saw that is was just a bit past six pm 
and thought that maybe she would still be able to make it to Kim&#39;s for 
dinner. She was starving. Soon she found herself standing at the foot of 
the stairs to Kim&#39;s apartment building and she got a sinking feeling 
deep within her soul. She didn&#39;t know why, but it almost felt like 
something dark fell over the building. Quickly the girl mounted the 
stairs two at a time until she reached the third floor. The moment her 
foot stepped on the landing she knew there was something indeed wrong. 
She turned to see that the door to Kim&#39;s apartment door stood wide open 
and a light trailed out from the kitchen. 

Natalie broke into a run and as she stepped into the apartment a wave of 
fear crept onto her heart. Her eyes immediately fell on a clutter of 
utensils that lay scattered upon the floor along with the drawer they 
came from. She stepped carefully over the clutter of knives and forks 
and crept into the living room, where she stopped in her tracks and felt 
the strength sap from her knees. 

There, before her, lay Mrs. Harrison next to a small night table, a 
large pool of blood formed around her head. Not far away Mr. Harrison 
lay face down with a long, blood soaked, kitchen knife laying next to 
him. Natalie felt her own stomach turn and the need to throw up as the 
smell of death hit her nostrils. Suddenly panic rose in her as she 
realized that Kimberly was nowhere in sight, &quot;Kim?&quot; She said softly at 
first, &quot;KIM!?!&quot; She then yelled. She quickly stepped over the bodies and 
checked her friend&#39;s room, then the others. Kim was nowhere to be seen. 
She quickly ran out of the apartment and scanned over the path balcony, 
&quot;KIMBERLY!!!&quot; She yelled into the setting sun. 

A neighbouring door opened and someone peeked their head out, &quot;What is 
all that yelling about?&quot; Someone asked as they stepped out into the 
evening air. Natalie stumbled around bewildered. She had to find 
Kimberly. She pushed past the person without thinking and ran down the 
stairs. She was responsible some how; she knew she had to be. 

                             *****

Streetlights shone across Natalie as she woke up from yet another 
nightmare. For the past few weeks her dreams were getting increasingly 
detailed and stayed fresh in her mind. Memories of Kimberly like she has 
had even night since the day Natalie found her friend&#39;s family dead. 
However, there was something different this time. There was more then 
the usual recollections. Kim was in the Alleys with another girl and a 
strange shadow unlike anything she had ever seen before. She could still 
feel Kimberly&#39;s presence close to her heart, could almost smell 
Kimberly&#39;s hair. She gripped at her chest tighter as the feelings of 
losing her friend again began to fill her heart and mind. She spent over 
the last few years fighting this feeling of loss, however today it was 
much stronger and for some unexplainable reason it felt as if it were 
pulling on her.   

Natalie began to roll over in the bed only to notice that her entire 
body ached. She felt like she had just received the beating of her life. 
She turned over to see short, scruffy, light brown hair poking out from 
under the blankets. Natalie lightly set a hand on the sleeping body that 
lay beside her. A soft moan could be heard from the bowels of the 
blankets, then an arm emerged as a girl with a long, boyish, face rolled 
over on her back, still sound asleep. The street&#39;s light almost made the 
girl&#39;s skin glow and Natalie leaned closer to placed a light kiss upon 
the girl&#39;s cheek. 

Natalie reached out and brushed a lock of hair out of the girl&#39;s eyes, 
&quot;Alyson?&quot; Natalie whispered softly not really wanting to wake the girl. 
Over the year the two had grown very close and Natalie could not think 
of living without her presence. Alyson was so princely in her own ways. 
She watched out for Natalie ever since the day they met so long ago. 
Natalie didn&#39;t mind, actually she felt safer with Alyson around, more so 
whenever Alyson&#39;s brother was around. There was something about the man 
that shook Natalie to her very core. She was not sure what it was about 
the man, it might have something to do with the way he just appears out 
of nowhere. It was as if he was a shadow. He never made a sound and the 
way he looked at Natalie made her a shiver at the mere thought. 

Her hand touched a small pendant that hung around her neck, a small 
amethyst crystal on a silver chain that Alyson gave it to her on her 
sixteenth birthday. It was small and not very flashy, nevertheless 
Natalie loved it all the same and on nights like this one she found 
herself holding the pendant firmly in her hand and remembering the first 
day they met. Sometime she would hold it tight enough to leave red marks 
in the palm of her hand. She stared at the pendant for a moment. 
Watching it sway in and out of a beam of moonlight. Again she gazed down 
at the girl next to her and she held the crystal close to her heart.

                             *****

Natalie searched all over town for Kimberly. Night fell faster than she 
was ready for and soon she found herself lost in the back alleys of the 
streets; calling out Kimberly&#39;s name everywhere she went. At one time 
she heard a police siren wailing out in the night and she found herself 
hiding from the sound without knowing why. Before long she was so lost 
she became scared for Kim as much as for herself. She leaned against a 
brick wall trying hard to stifle back the tears. She closed her eyes and 
took a deep breath. When she opened them a strange fog had surrounded 
her.

Natalie became suddenly very aware of where she was. She coughed and 
covered her mouth as the thick mist tried to fill her lungs. Something 
under the surface of the fog began to circle around her creating small 
ripples in the cloud; &quot;NO!!&quot; she spun around to see the mist starting to 
funnel into a twisting column like an inverted tornado. A pair of blood 
red eyes opened up at the head of the column and scales began to form 
along the surface of the cloud as the top half took on the form of a 
giant albino snake while the rest of the body of fog encircled the girl.

Natalie turned to run when the snake struck out at her and grabbed her 
by the leg with its tail, causing the girl to fall to the ground. 
Natalie let out a terrified scream as she started to feel herself being 
pulled backwards towards the creature. 

A person ran passed Natalie and jumped into the depths of the mist. The 
sounds of fighting could be heard, but Natalie was too busy keeping her 
eyes shut. She felt her leg being released and she crawled beside a 
dumpster and cover her ears as an awful high-pitched howl filled the 
night. 

Almost as soon as it started the sound ended and yet Natalie stayed 
cowering in her hiding spot. Her saviour stepped out from around the 
corner and gazed down at the shaking girl. The full moon backlit the 
person so Natalie had trouble-making out who it was. The person reached 
out and grabbed her by the arm, forcing Natalie to her feet. 

&quot;NOOO!!!&quot; Natalie began to protest, &quot;Let me go! Let me go!&quot; She cried. 

&quot;Will you stop crying already?&quot; A rather deep, yet female voice said, 
clearly annoyed by Natalie&#39;s reaction to her, &quot;I thought you were 
stronger then this.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Natalie stopped fighting and looked up at the girl who stood 
before her. She found herself blinking at a tall boyishly handsome girl 
only a couple years older then Natalie. She was clad only in tight black 
leather pants and an oversized leather jacket with a zipper that started 
at the girls left shoulder and ended at her right hip. The jacket was 
unzipped to reveal a black t-shirt underneath. A long katana was held 
firmly in the girl&#39;s right hand glimmering against the moon&#39;s light, 
&quot;Alyshione???&quot; Natalie asked in confusion.  

&quot;So you do know my name.&quot; The girl said as she sheathed her sword on her 
back.

&quot;Everyone knows you.&quot; Natalie said, still in shock at whom she was 
talking to. Alyshione Dalfort, or Alyson to those who would call her a 
friend (which there were very few), was the most popular girl in the 
area. No one knew where she came from, nevertheless over half the girls 
at Whispering Hills Academy dreamed about getting a chance to talk to 
her, or, in some cases, even go on a date with her, &quot;What are you doing 
out here?&quot; Natalie asked, befuddled. 

&quot;I should be asking you that same question.&quot; Alyson examined the girl up 
and down, &quot;I thought only East Wingers were foolish enough to wander 
here at night.&quot; She said as she started to walk away, almost as if she 
really didn&#39;t care to hear the answer. 

&quot;My friend is missing...&quot; Natalie felt her eyes drift to the ground, &quot;I 
promised I would protect her and I&#39;ve already failed her.&quot; A tear 
brimmed in her eyes. 

Alyson stopped and gazed up at the sky, &quot;I really miss seeing the 
stars.&quot; She said to no one in particular, &quot;Come on.&quot; Alyshione nodded 
down the road, &quot;I guess I can help you find your friend.&quot; She started 
down the road without waiting for Natalie&#39;s reply. 

Natalie tried hard to keep up with Alyshione as they wove their way 
through the maze of back streets. No matter how lost Natalie felt, it 
was almost as if Alyshione knew exactly where to turn; as if she had 
ventured these dark roads many a time over her years. Before long the 
two of them found themselves back on the normal streets. Natalie let out 
a sigh of relief as she watched a car slowly pass by. She thought for 
sure that she would never escape the maddening maze of alleyways. 

Upon stepping out of the alleys Alyson quickened her step as she crossed 
the road heading toward a small set of complexes off in the distance. 
Natalie found herself having to jog in order to keep pace with the girl. 
It was like Alyson never ran out of breath, never paused to make sure 
she was on the right path, and never even took a look at her 
surroundings. Not once did she even look back to see if Natalie was 
keeping up. The two walked down the street until they arrived at a 
sidewalk that lead up to a small two-floor condo. Without hesitation 
Alyson took out a set of keys from the back pocket of her pants and 
opened the door, leaving the door open for Natalie to enter. Alyson did 
not turn around to see if the girl followed her as she took off her 
shoes, dropped the sword in an umbrella stand (which held three other 
swords as well as two umbrellas) and began to strip off her jacket, 
showing off the tight white t-shirt that she wore underneath, &quot;You can 
close the door anytime.&quot; She said as she hung her jacket on a hook on 
the wall. 

&quot;Oh, Sorry.&quot; Natalie quickly entered and closed the door, but did not 
move from the doorway. 

&quot;Would you like something to drink?&quot; Alyson asked as she entered a large 
kitchen that stood off to the side. The wall had a long window cut into 
it, with wooden shutters that were currently open, so Natalie would see 
into the kitchen and watch as Alyson opened the fridge and pulled out a 
jug of juice. 

&quot;Yes please.&quot; Natalie said politely. She had never felt so nervous 
before in her life, and could not keep her eyes off Alyson, the way her 
shirt formed perfectly to her athletic body and small chest, as the girl 
opened the cupboard, grabbed a pair of glasses and began to fill them. 

Natalie blushed as she noticed that she was staring at the girl and 
stared down at the ground.  

&quot;Have a seat in the living room. I&#39;ll be right with you.&quot; Alyson said 
gesturing over her shoulder.

Slowly, Natalie began to remove her shoes. She glanced around the living 
room, which was located to the side of the kitchen. Another set of 
swords hung on a rack above the couch and many odd-looking porcelain 
masks lined the walls. Natalie found herself standing in awe of the 
array of things around her. The entire room held an air to it that made 
the girl feel small standing in the centre of it all. 

&quot;I hate those things.&quot; Alyson said nodding towards the masks in disgust 
as she entered the room and handed Natalie a glass of juice, then 
plopped down on the sofa, &quot;My brother has been collecting them for 
years.&quot; She shivered, &quot;You&#39;re probably tired from your adventure. Sit.&quot; 
She more commanded this time then asked. 
                                   
&quot;Thank you.&quot; Natalie said as she lowered herself beside Alyson. She 
suddenly realized just how tired she really was, as every part of her 
wanted to collapse and the glass began to slip from her hands.

&quot;Oops.&quot; Alyson grabbed the glass from Natalie&#39;s hand and set it down on 
the coffee table, &quot;Maybe I should take you to bed?&quot; 

&quot;No no... that&#39;s alright...&quot; Natalie tried to stand, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be 
in the waaayyy...&quot; It was like her legs would not respond and she fell 
over, landing on Alyson&#146;s lap. 

&quot;It would seem that you were in the Alleys a bit too long.&quot; Alyson said 
as she helped the girl sit up again. Natalie suddenly flinched in pain 
as the girl touched her side, &quot;Where does it hurt?&quot; Alyson knelt next to 
the girl, examining her as she clenched her side. 

&quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot; The blonde said between gasps for air. It suddenly felt 
as if her ribs were broken, or what she thought it would feel like to 
have her ribs broken, &quot;It happened during gymnastics practice. Nothing 
special.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to burden this girl with her problems, and she 
felt she should really be getting home.

&quot;Yeah right.&quot; Alyson grabbed Natalie&#39;s shirt by the bottom and quickly 
pulled it over the girl&#39;s head and tossed it on the back of the sofa. 
Natalie blinked not sure how she found herself to be sitting in her 
training bra, &quot;Let me see what you did to yourself.&quot; Alyson said as she 
inspected Natalie&#39;s chest, &quot;This is not good.&quot; Alyson stared a large 
bruise that was forming on Natalie&#39;s side, which was an odd yellow 
colour and seemed to be spreading along her ribs. She gazed into 
Natalie&#39;s eyes almost searching for something within them, &quot;You 
promised...&quot; She said the words almost too soft for Natalie to hear.               

At that moment the front door opened, &quot;Alyshione?&quot; a deep voice called 
out as someone entered the house. 

&quot;Over here brother.&quot; She didn&#39;t let her eyes leave Natalie&#39;s as she 
spoke, &quot;We have company.&quot; 

A large tall man stepped out of the doorway and into the room. He 
towered over the two girls as he took off his long white cloak to reveal 
a dark black uniform that almost pulled the light into it. His white 
wiry hair hung loosely in his eyes as he looked down at the two girls. 
They bore into Natalie as she glanced up at him, then as she suddenly 
realizing that she was topless and quickly covered her body with her 
arms, turned away from his gaze and tried to hide in the sofa. The man 
tilted his head to see the bruises along the girl&#39;s side, and then 
turned to hang his cloak upon a hook near the door.

&quot;She is a &#39;promised.&#39;&quot; Alyson said to her brother&#39;s back. 

&quot;As I see.&quot; He replied, as he began to head down the hall to the back of 
the house, &quot;If you want to keep her she will be your pupil, not mine.&quot; 
He said as he disappeared down the hall and up a set of stairs.

Alyson&#39;s eyes glittered and she yelled after her brother, &quot;Can she 
really stay?&quot; There was a note of excitement in her voice that made 
Natalie feel a little uneasy. 

&quot;Just remember: She is your responsibility.&quot; The man&#39;s voice drifted 
from the depths of the house. 

&quot;&#39;Keep her?&#39;&quot; Natalie repeated in confusion, &quot;What does he mean &#39;Keep 
her&#39;?&quot; She asked Alyson. 

The shorthaired girl turned back to Natalie, &quot;It just means that you can 
stay.&quot; Alyson said with a smile, &quot;And you did say you wanted to find 
your friend, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but what does that have to do with staying here?&quot; Natalie was 
even more confused, and the look in Alyson&#39;s eyes was beginning to scare 
her a bit.

&quot;Drake and I are... explorers...&quot; She said, grabbing her glass as she 
sat upon the couch again, &quot;He taught me everything I know and if you 
want to help your friend you are going to need to work for it.&quot; She took 
a sip of her drink, &quot;I&#39;m guessing that your family doesn&#39;t really notice 
when you are missing now do they?&quot;  

&quot;I&#39;m adopted... They don&#39;t seem to care if I&#39;m alive. I don&#39;t think they 
will care if I leave.&quot; Natalie said sadly, however no matter how much 
her family hated her she was suddenly not sure coming here was such a 
good idea, but if it helped her find Kimberly she would do anything, 
&quot;But what was this about a &#39;Promised?&#39; And why do you both seem so 
interested in this bruise of mine?&quot;

Alyson set the glass down; &quot;You mentioned that you made a promise to 
someone.&quot; She looked Natalie in the eyes; &quot;I can see it in your eyes. A 
promise to protect someone.&quot; She didn&#39;t let her eyes waver from Natalie. 

Nervously, Natalie&#39;s eyes darted around, &quot;Yeah...&quot; She turned and gazed 
at the floor, &quot;I promised Kim that I would protect her.&quot; She tried hard 
not to let her emotions get the better of her as she felt a bout of 
tears begin to form, &quot;But I failed.&quot;

&quot;No you haven&#39;t. That bruise is your link.&quot; Alyson said pointing to 
Natalie&#39;s side, &quot;When you made that promise your souls were intertwined 
to the point where you now reflect her pains.&quot;

Gently Natalie touched her side, &quot;So Kim has the same bruise?&quot; She 
asked, almost afraid to hear the answer. 

&quot;More than likely she has a broken rib, or at the least a small 
fracture.&quot; Alyson took another sip of her drink, was not fazed by any of 
their conversation. 

Natalie watched the girl perplexed, &quot;How... how do I know any of this is 
true?&quot; She asked. 

Alyson set her glass on the coffee table and adjusted her seating so she 
now faced the girl, &quot;Because we are the same.&quot; She then pulled off her 
own top. Natalie stared at the girl for a moment, stunned by the fact 
that the girl wore no bra and then her eyes moved to the many dark 
yellowish slash marks that covered her entire chest, they angry and 
appeared very deep, but they were only on the surface. Natalie almost 
wanted to reach out and touch them, but stopped herself, &quot;I promised 
someone once too.&#148; Alyson continued, &#147;Now I have to live with their 
pains. The only good thing is that as long as I feel their pain I know 
they are still alive.&quot; She leaned closer to Natalie, &quot;And that one day 
we will meet them again. As long as you keep her in your heart it will 
lead you to her.&quot;

                             ******

Natalie cautiously slipped out from under the blankets while holding her 
side, which was throbbing, but not as much as the side of face, which 
stung. She carefully snuck out of the room and entered the washroom 
where she flipped a switch next to the door flooding the room with 
light. The washroom was small enough only for one person with a small 
mirror hanging over a small sink next to a toilet. Natalie approached 
the sink and turned on the water. She looked at her reflection as the 
cold water filled her hands. A large bruise had formed over her right 
eye and her lip was broken open. She gingerly touched the bruise and 
winced in pain. The sight of the wounds worried Natalie even more. She 
quietly turned off the light and returned to the bedroom where she found 
her jean skirt and a t-shirt, then got dressed. 

She took another glance at Alyson&#39;s sleeping form before carefully 
tiptoeing down the hall towards the front door. The feeling in her chest 
grew stronger with every step and it was almost calling to her. She 
quickly grabbed a long rectangular metal box, with leather straps coming 
off the sides, off from its hook on the wall. It was about the length of 
her forearm and placed the instrument along her right arm and buckled it 
in place. She then put on her black leather boots, pair of red ski 
goggles and leather jacket, before grabbing her tattered canvas cloak, 
all gifts from Alyson. When she was finish dressing she opened the door 
to peeked out into the night. Only when she was sure that there was no 
one about did she push through the door and plunged into the darkness of 
some nearby trees. She took one last look at the house that had been her 
home this past while, before turning away and running off to find out 
what was calling her so late in the night.

&quot;Kimberly.&quot; She asked to herself while gazing up at the starless sky, 
&quot;Where are you?&quot;

Keeping her mind on the image of her friend, she wove her way through 
the city. No destination in mind only following the feeling in her heart 
and allowing her feet to take her where she needed to go. If her heart 
told her to turn left she would do such without a single hesitation. 
Alyson taught her how to follow these feelings long ago, however this 
was the first time it was strong enough to get a clear picture of which 
way to journey. Every other time the feeling would fade only moments 
into her travels, however this time the sensation was only building upon 
itself with every step she made. Before long Natalie realized where the 
feeling was bringing her and before long she found herself stopping 
before the gated archway of Whisper Hills Academy. She glanced around 
quickly to see if she could have possibly made a mistake, again the 
feeling grew in strength and it was crying out to her from somewhere 
beyond the gates. She took a deep breath and quickly marched towards the 
entrance. 

Ignoring the lights of the buildings in the distance Natalie turned off 
the path and trudged across the lawn, wet from nightly sprinklers. A new 
sense of urgency started to enter the girl&#39;s heart and she broke into a 
hard run until she came across a large chain linked fence, which was 
meant to keep the students from using the pool area after class was out. 
Natalie quickly scaled the barrier and sprinted across the patio towards 
the large body of water normally used by the school&#39;s swim team. She 
circled the pool, her eyes alertly searching the clear waters. She 
finally stopped at the deep end of the pool in confusion. She was 
certain her heart was telling her to come to this location, however 
there didn&#39;t seem to be anything there, even the water seemed calm. Then 
her eyes fell on something unusual. Not far from where she stood there 
was a small ring of ripples. She started to move closer to the edge of 
the water to see the ripples begin to grow in strength. Suddenly a hand 
burst through the surface of the water. Instinctively Natalie tore off 
her cloak and jacket and pulled the goggles into place before plunging 
into the pool. Beneath the surface she discovered two girls struggling 
to reach the top, one she realized right away was Kimberly, however 
there seemed to be something pulling them down. Natalie dove even deeper 
to find a dark mass forming below the girl&#39;s. A shadowy tentacle was 
wrapped around one of their legs and slowly dragging both deeper into 
the depths of the unknown. 

With a slight twist of Natalie&#39;s right wrist and a long blade sprung 
forth from the device beneath the girl&#39;s sleeve and she swam at the 
darkness to find herself faced with a pair of glowing red eyes and a 
mass of teeth. Natalie didn&#39;t hesitate for a moment as she plunged the 
silver blade into the shape. Many tendrils of shadow shot forth at the 
girl, however Natalie easily dodged the creature&#39;s attacks, cutting a 
tentacle here and there. With each slash of her blade she dove closer to 
the mass until she plunged her bladed arm deep into the depths of the 
darkness.  A low gurgled roar could be heard as the creature let go of 
its prey and the three girls were propelled out of the depths. Natalie 
quickly grabbed hold of the girls and swam them to the edge of the pool 
where she hauled the girls out of the water and flopped on the ground 
between the girls, panting heavily. A smile crossed her face and she 
began to laugh uncontrollably and let out a whopping holler of delight, 
&#147;I found her Alyson!&#148; She cried out into the night air, &#147;I finally found 
here.&#148;
