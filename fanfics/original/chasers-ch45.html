<a href="../original/chasers-ch44.html">Back to Part 44</a><pre>&quot;Mr Mayor,&quot; Gwen Musahi reached out to take his hand,
the Asian woman studying the larger, black haired man
thoughtfully.

&quot;I wish we were meeting again under more pleasant
circumstances,&quot; the mayor said stiffly. John Brown
clearly looked unhappy as he sat down behind his desk
in the temporary City Hall, the explosions of a week
ago damaging the old facility too much to be useful.

&quot;I do too, of course,&quot; Gwen agreed as she sat down
smoothly, her business suit neat and badge clipped to
her vest pocket.

John studied her a moment, &quot;There are officials in the
Police department and City Hall asking for your hide.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m aware of that,&quot; Gwen looked at him with her odd
grey eyes, &quot;and I also know you won&#39;t do it.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; the Mayor asked flatly.

&quot;Because,&quot; Gwen met his gaze, &quot;prosecuting me means
revealing I set up my department as a back up command
center illegally, and would also show exactly how flat
footed this entire emergency revealed the police to
be.&quot;

John tapped a ten on the desk then smiled reluctantly.
&quot;That&#39;s what the Commissioner told me you&#39;d say,&quot; he
admitted. &quot;So how long have you had Chaser&#39;s
headquarters set up as a emergency command center?&quot;

&quot;Do you really want me to answer that?&quot; Gwen smiled
wryly, &quot;If I do get charged you might have to
testify.&quot;

&quot;Gah,&quot; the Mayor made a face. &quot;The Comish is being
very wary about speculation on who set the bombs. Do
you know?&quot; he asked.

&quot;We have limited data to work with,&quot; Gwen said
apologetically. &quot;All the bombs were made using
commercial components using different designs
available from the internet,&quot; she revealed, &quot;and
security data files were wiped in a hack that occurred
during the attack.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; the Mayor muttered, &quot;is there anything you can
tell me?&quot;

&quot;Just this,&quot; Gwen paused a moment, &quot;most bombers rely
on just one type of bomb or explosive device... they
become experts on it, almost fixated. Whoever did this
does not fit the usual profile at all.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s a organization,&quot; John smiled hungrily, &quot;like
the Android terrorists?&quot;

&quot;Probably not,&quot; Gwen replied honestly.

&quot;Why?&quot; John frowned.

&quot;How do they benefit?&quot; Gwen pointed out. A grim smile,
&quot;This sort of strike should have been followed up by a
threat or demands. Instead we&#39;ve had a week of
silence.&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; John sat back, clearly unhappy. The Mayor
fiddled with papers on his desk, &quot;I understand you&#39;ve
requested more officers?&quot;

&quot;For several months now, yes,&quot; Gwen nodded.

&quot;The Commissioner has suggested approving a civilian
assistant and another patrol officer,&quot; the Mayor
grumped, &quot;I&#39;m signing off on that. However, I want to
see some results in return, is that understood?&quot;

&quot;Of course sir,&quot; Gwen rose to salute. &quot;Is that all?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; he said flatly as she left. The Mayor sat back
in his chair once she was gone, them picked up the
phone. &quot;You&#39;re sure we can&#39;t fire her?&quot; he asked after
dialing.

&quot;It&#39;d be political suicide at this time.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s no hero,&quot; the Mayor scowled, &quot;just a
uppity....&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even say that in private, John. She arguably
saved a lot of lives after the explosions. For the
time being, she&#39;s untouchable.&quot;

&quot;For the time being,&quot; John agreed. But with a feral
smile, &quot;But as soon as I can, I&#39;m going to fire her
ass.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s your privilege. Just don&#39;t do it without
justification first.&quot;

Gwen Musahi smiled wryly as she left the tower,
heading back several blocks to the older Police
Headquarters. Several officers seemed wary of her and
others equally welcoming as the various politically
aligned cops in the department tried to determine
which way the wind was blowing, so to speak.

&quot;Hello Beth, Naru,&quot; Gwen said calmly as she entered
the computer core that was Beth&#39;s personal playground.
A hybrid of standard police tech and Beth&#39;s designs it
was a remarkable machine... one that had recently
proved it could even help run a city.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Naru smiled as the tall young woman poured
Beth a cup of coffee, both woman a bit smudged from
working on the computer core again.

&quot;Hanging around again?&quot; Gwen asked, still mildly
astonished at seeing the young woman who looked like a
softer, gentler version of Kate.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. I was even thinking of asking if there
were any volunteer positions available,&quot; Naru smiled
sweetly.

&quot;I might talk to you about that later,&quot; Gwen gave her
one of her more enigmatic smiles as she went down the
hall.

&quot;Gwen,&quot; the older man nodded as he walked down the
hall towards her, his wooden cane tapping softly,
&quot;Kate&#39;s been busy. I finished examinations of both
androids she brought in, reports on your desk.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Richard,&quot; Gwen smiled, &quot;anything unusual?&quot;

Dr. Richard Davis shrugged slightly, &quot;Standard logic
failure in both.&quot;

They parted as Gwen reached a closed door and knocked
firmly. &quot;Kate?&quot; she called.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Kate responded distractedly.

Gwen pushed the door open, surveying the somewhat
ordered chaos that ruled her second in command&#39;s
office. Papers, a extremely old fashioned fetish,
covered the desk and floor, while old coffee cups,
drink cans and at least one take out container hung
about.

&quot;Heard of housekeeping?&quot; Gwen asked as Kate turned
from pinning a notice to her wall.

&quot;No, but if you hum a few bars I&#39;ll fake it,&quot; Kate
said as she took a seat, &quot;what&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve gotten clearance to bring in a new officer and a
civilian aide,&quot; Gwen began.

&quot;And you want Naru for the civvy,&quot; Kate said,
stretching out in her chair tiredly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Gwen admitted, &quot;she&#39;s done surprisingly well
the last week. But if you object I can consider
another candidate....&quot;

Kate frowned, tapping a finger on her desk top. &quot;No, I
think you should hire her,&quot; she finally said
reluctantly, &quot;she clicks with all of us. My own issues
with her are more.. personal.&quot;

&quot;Talked to the family yet?&quot;Gwen asked gently.

&quot;My Aunt called to check up on Naru,&quot; Kate admitted,
&quot;we talked a bit, too.&quot; She flashed a grin,
&quot;Cantankerous old bird, reminded me of me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you got along,&quot; Gwen chuckled as she left
the office.

&quot;Don&#39;t bet on it,&quot; Kate called as Gwen left.

Gwen shook her head, smiling wryly. It was too bad Jen
and Julie weren&#39;t in today, she&#39;d rather have broken
the news to Julie that she wasn&#39;t becoming a full time
Chaser in person. As it was Julie would hear about the
Chasers having a opening via the grapevine, and would
probably come to Gwen asking about it. All very
awkward.</pre>
