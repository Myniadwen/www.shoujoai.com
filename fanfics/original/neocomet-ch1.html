<pre>Author&#39;s Notes
============
Hey there! Kaiser here. This &#39;little&#39; story here is something I like to 
think of as one of my more important and serious fictions. Inspired 
mainly by the computer games Guilty Gear, Toshinden and Psychic Force, I 
take a lot of pride in naming this as my second longest story of all 
time (by Feb &#39;05) at a meaty novel-length of 139,000+ words. More than 
twice the size of Tokyo Iron Child Akari! Anyways, a few things of 
notice. One, this story was written over a three year period, between 
&#39;03, &#39;04, and &#39;05. So if the standard of writing seems better in some 
areas than others then you&#39;ll know why. Also, this is only one part of a 
bigger series (The Neo Comet Swordsman Series) which currently has two 
titles to its name (the other being Neo Comet Swordsman Saizaki). I&#39;ve 
also written an FAQ for the entire Neo Comet Swordsman Series, 24,000+ 
words long. If your interested in reading it, drop me a request for it 
via e-mail and I&#39;ll send it to you as soon as I can. However, I suggest 
that you read all the available Neo Comet Fictions before you read the 
FAQ. You wouldn&#39;t wanna spoil any of the surprises for yourself, would 
ya? Okay then! Lets get the party started!

Neo Comet Swordsman Setsuya:
Second Origin 

 ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ 

&quot;Weep and wail, you shepherds;
roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock.

For your time to be slaughtered has come;
you will fall and be shattered like fine pottery.

The shepherds will have no place to flee,
the leaders of the flock no place to escape.

Hear the cry of the shepherds,
the wailing leaders of the flock,
for the LORD is destroying their pasture.

The peaceful meadows will be laid waste
because of the fierce anger of the LORD.

Like a lion he will leave his lair, 
and their land will become desolate
because of the sword of the oppressor 
and because of the LORD&#39;s fierce anger.&quot; 

- Jeremiah 26:34 &quot;The Cup of God&#39;s Wrath&quot;

WIND OF THE SPRING
FIRE IN THE SUMMER
LIGHTNING OF THE AUTUMN,
DARKNESS OF WINTER,

WE ALL FADE TO BLACK

 ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ 

2050. The world reached a new age of prosperity and peace. All conflicts 
were resolved by creating a unified group of every country around the 
earth. The World Federation. The whole of the Earth is united in 
celebration at the beginning of world peace and the dawning of a new 
era, free of suffering. But then the order of things is disturbed. By 
freak accident or by destiny, a gigantic meteor which would come to be 
known as the Genesis Comet crash-landed into the planet. From the 
following destruction, an estimated 78% of the human race is wiped from 
the face of existence. Science and technology as we know it is 
irreparably  injured, sinking the world into depression and mayhem

2053: The governments newly formed in the world decide that the few 
remaining countries left standing will be reinforced with magical 
barriers. This became known as the Safe-Zone Project.

2067: The world is now beginning to recover from the landing of the 
comet, and the first Safe-Zones (Neo-Japan, Neo-England, Neo-Germany and 
Neo-Spain) are completed. 

2071: Keijiro Seisuji begins the first ever excavation of the Genesis 
Comet. He discovers four &#39;Sacred Swords&#39; hidden within its bowls. 
Shortly after their finding, Keijiro is assassinated by unknown forces 
and the four sacred swords are lost. 

2081: Present day. The Safe-Zone Project is (largely) completed. A new 
organization known as the Shougatsu Financial Group appears. With 
ominous intentions... 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Setsuya&#39;s Destiny 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Yuuga school of Sword Arts, Osaka, Neo-Japan

&quot;Well, well, well. Look where the hell I am.&quot;

With a deep breath, the fiery adventurer swordsman, Setsuya Seisuji 
studied his surroundings. The Yuuga school of Sword Arts. It was hard 
for him to believe that he was finally back here. Back in Neo-Japan, 
back in JPN-city No. 1, Osaka. When he left Osaka to explore the ruined 
world, he never expected to actually return. But fate was a fickle 
mistress. One minute he was doing battle with ten armed desert bandits 
and a prayer, the next he was receiving word that his old sword master, 
had died suddenly. 

Now Setsuya wasn&#39;t a compassionate man, but he knew he had to go back to 
Osaka and attend the funeral out of respect. His old master was a 
legendary fighter, who really helped him along the path to his current 
status. Taught him all about life and what it meant to be a warrior. 
Such bonds were hard to break. 

Dust blew off the ground as Setsuya&#39;s boots stepped through the main 
courtyard, leading him towards the main centre of his old training 
facility. The training centre was nothing special really. In someone&#39;s 
eyes, you could call it dilapidated. Cobble stone pathways, wooden 
buildings and walls, smoked glass for windows. But it was 
understandable. The Genesis Comet had really worked the world into 
devastation. Since this was built after the landing, it was no surprise 
that it was in shambles. Not many resources left in the world to go by. 

Setsuya walked up the large flight of steps leading to the main hall, 
surveying the place once more. Not much had changed these past two years 
since his leaving. His entrance into the main hall was welcomed by 
dozens of old statues and paintings, ancient tapestries and scrolls that 
had some how survived the destruction. And as his searing blue eyes took 
this all in, he was unknowingly greeted by an old acquaintance. The man 
was aging, around his mid-50&#39;s, indicated by his hovelled frame and wiry 
skin. Swathed in a pasty grey cloak and roughly sandaled feet, the old 
man called out to Setsuya from the other side of the hall. 

&quot;Seisuji-san!&quot; Called the old man. &quot;Greetings!&quot;

Setsuya broke out of his reverie to see who was calling him. It couldn&#39;t 
be... &quot;Yurunosuke-san?&quot;

Yurunosuke walked up to Setsuya as best he could, his shrivelled feet 
tapping lightly on the floorboard ground. He rested his palm on 
Setsuya&#39;s shoulder and smiled happily. 

&quot;It is good to see you, Setsuya.&quot; He said. &quot;It has been two whole years 
since you left the training hall, you do realize that?&quot;

Setsuya nodded. &quot;Yes. I have been travelling for a while now. I didn&#39;t 
expect to hear that the master had...&quot;

The smile fell of Yurunosuke&#39;s face as Setsuya trailed off. It was 
disturbing to think of the wise old master&#39;s death. By natural causes, 
no less. That was the only consolation in all this. 

&quot;It was a great loss.&quot; Yurunosuke said sadly. &quot;He was dear to us all. We 
have at least made preparations for his funeral. The Gods will not 
accept him in bad graces. He shall be sent off as best we can with all 
we have.&quot;

Setsuya grinned. Mention of the &#39;Gods&#39; never ceased to amaze him. It was 
another aftershock of the Genesis Comet. With the mortal wound that 
humanity sustained... and the destruction of science that followed 
after, the worlds populous had turned once again to Religion and Magic. 
Still, there were some left in the world who was abhorred by these 
ideas. Setsuya was one of them. 

&quot;I see.&quot; He responded sardonically. &quot;And the Gods would have expected 
this, yeah? Wipe out half the world and get my master too? Heh, heh, 
heh. Lucky bastards.&quot;

Yurunosuke sighed. Setsuya&#39;s lack of belief was nothing new. &quot;The world 
needs something to believe in, Setsuya. If it gives us a fresh hope, 
want more could you expect?&quot;

&quot;Maybe food in the mouths of the hungry? Homes for vagrants and 
drifters? While the &#39;Gods&#39; sit atop the clouds and marvel at the 
creation they can manipulate and destroy, the ever-lowly mortals can 
scrape and kill each other over the last few shreds of happiness we can 
gain. If the benevolent Gods can ruin the world, why can&#39;t they come 
down and save it?&quot;

A small silence filled the hall after Setsuya said that. There was no 
real way for Yurunosuke to answer that. He didn&#39;t have the answers at 
all. But he did have faith. And the hope in his heart that things would 
get better for Mother Earth. 

&quot;Have faith, Setsuya.&quot; Yurunosuke said. &quot;The world will recover. Until 
then, the people remaining need something to believe in, to strive for. 
If it keeps us going... then it is sufficient.&quot;

Setsuya snorted. &quot;Can the world really recover? I dunno. Ever since that 
Genesis Comet crashed landed into the planet 31 years ago, wiping out 
78% of the human race... everything has been a struggle. I was born 
after the landing, but I know that the old world had to be better than 
this one.&quot;

A wave for nostalgia filled Yurunosuke from hearing that. He was a 
little older that Setsuya when it landed, so he remembered what the old 
world was like. Beautiful, prosperous and peaceful. This blasted world 
of 2081 was so different from then.

&quot;You&#39;ve seen the outside world.&quot; Yurunosuke alleged to Setsuya. &quot;You 
know what condition the outside world is in. In the security of the 
Neo-Japan Safe-Zone, I am shielded from its horrors. Maybe seeing so 
much agony has hardened your heart.&quot;

Setsuya thought about that. He did feel like he was becoming a little 
vindictive about future hopes. He just could not believe that the world 
could save itself from the hell it had been thrown into. Before he put 
too much thought into this, Setsuya changed the subject. 

&quot;Forget that, Yurunosuke. This day is about the old master. Making sure 
that his funeral goes down well. Have you sent out invitations to all 
his previous disciples?&quot;

The older man nodded. &quot;Yes. Most of them have returned here to attend 
the ceremony. However, we have heard nothing from Aarin.&quot;

Setsuya grinned deviously at the mention of his rival. 

Aarin Highland. 

The Englishman had trained at the Yuuga School also, during that time; 
he and Aarin had developed a healthy friendship amidst a fierce rivalry. 
Back in the old days, they were the only ones who could give each other 
a decent battle. Setsuya was looking forward to a good fight when he 
returned to Osaka. Hopefully, Aarin would return and deliver. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Setsuya said knowingly. &quot;Highland will show, eventually. 
The master meant a lot to him, too.&quot;

Yurunosuke didn&#39;t very much like that look on Setsuya&#39;s face. That vivid 
look of battle thirst. &quot;I hope you won&#39;t bring disorder to the ceremony 
by starting off your contention with him. As you said, this is the 
master&#39;s day.&quot;

Setsuya shook his hands, ignoring the gut feeling of a high-quality 
challenge. &quot;Relax. I have as much respect as you do. I swear, if he 
shows up, we&#39;ll leave our scores to be settled another day.&quot;

Yurunosuke&#39;s look was still stern. &quot;Make sure that they do. The funeral 
will be held in a few days time; we still have a few more preparations 
to make before it starts. Will you be staying in the training hall, or 
will you seek living arraignments in the city?&quot;

Setsuya had been thinking about that. Staying in Osaka would be a bit of 
a chore; he&#39;d have to pay and everything. Plus, he was looking forward 
to seeing more of the training hall, and meeting up with some of the 
other students. 

&quot;I think I&#39;ll be staying.&quot; Setsuya adjusted his sheathed sword at his 
waist while saying this. &quot;I need to see more and... who knows what may 
happen.&quot;

Shougatsu Financial Group HQ, Munich, Neo-Germany

Deep in the heart of GRM-city No.3 (Munich), amidst the towering 
buildings of former industry and capitalism, there was a tall 
skyscraper, which somehow remained intact from the impact of the Genesis 
Comet. It stood apart from the other buildings, like an ominous aura 
surrounded it, warning those who looked that this was no ordinary 
commercial building. It housed secrets and hidden agendas that many 
could only dream of. Deep within its secretive bowls, halls of rich 
polished marble, with floors lined carpets imported from East-Persia, a 
solitary figure stalked along, walking quietly to his destination. 

He was a tall young man, around 23 years in age, clothed in fine 
garments (a standard suit, replicated from those created before the 
landing of the Genesis Comet). His crystalline eyes were a very pale 
red, and his long tresses of white hair swung from side to side 
elegantly as he strode through the halls of the Shougatsu Financial 
Group Headquarters. Before long he reached a large door. It was 
automatic, but since electricity had been lost due to the Comet, the 
ancient forces of magic powered the door. There was a stone plate on one 
side of the door, with the imprint of a hand. The young man placed his 
hand against it, and the stone plate lit up like fire. The wire-like 
lines of light that spread off from it went behind the door, and soon, 
that sizable door began to move on its own. 

Now that his path was clear, the young man stepped through the doorway 
and into the following room. An office like room, similar to the rest of 
the building, although this was richly furnished, rare furniture and 
ornaments littered about the place like a rich man&#39;s heaven. The man 
walked over to the desk poised at the middle of the exquisite room, and 
sat down peacefully on the seat behind it. As the man got comfortable, 
another figure appeared from across the room, popping out of the 
shadows.

He stood respectfully with his left arm held at his waist, bowing a 
little. Though his face was obscured by the shadows, he kept his devious 
grin under control.

The shadow man finally spoke. &quot;I have news, Master Aesus. The-&quot;

&quot;Stop!&quot; He yelled. 

The man in the shadows stopped speaking as his superior interrupted his 
declaration. After a short bout of silence, Aesus began to speak again. 

&quot;I thought I warned you about that before.&quot; He said sharply, shutting 
his crimson eyes. &quot;I discarded that name a long time ago. I am known as 
Zephaniah. And you will address me as such from now onwards. Unless you 
wish to incur my anger...?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; He said in response to &#39;Zephaniah&#39;. &quot;I do apologize master, but 
I have news for you.&quot;

&quot;Go on.&quot;

&quot;We have located one of the four sacred swords, sir. The one known as 
the Lightning Tooth. It has been confirmed to be in the hands of a young 
woman known as Ingrid Highland. Her position is confirmed; she is in Neo 
England, ENG-city No.4 (Manchester).&quot;

Zephaniah&#39;s eyes did not open. &quot;And you continue to leave it in her 
hands? Why have you not retrieved it?&quot;

&quot;I apologize, sir, but she belongs to a respectable family of the 
British aristocracy. It will be hard to target her without drawing 
attention from the public. Which makes the situation more complicated.&quot;

&quot;Is that so...?&quot; Zephaniah said maliciously. &quot;Maybe I have not made 
myself clear enough. Those four swords are vital to my plans. Do you 
understand? They are essential, and if I do not get them, the whole 
Second Origin Project will be thrown into chaos.&quot;

The man in the shadows squirmed. &quot;Yes... I know sir, but-&quot;

Once again, Zephaniah cut him off. &quot;Do not make excuses for yourself. I 
grow tired of you. Your mission is to find the other swords and bring 
them to me. That is all I require from you.&quot;

A gulp followed that. &quot;Yes sir.&quot;

Zephaniah finally opened his eyes, and then looked at the folder on his 
desk. It was fairly thin, but the data in it was priceless. He could 
tell by what it was marked with. &#39;The Four Sacred Swords Dossier&#39;

The white haired man grabbed the folder slowly and began to flick 
through it casually. &quot;Is this the data you&#39;ve collected about them so 
far?&quot;

The man in the shadows nodded, rubbing his hands a bit from nervousness. 
&quot;Yes, Master... Zephaniah. We have found out quite a bit about them from 
the notes of Keijiro Seisuji, the archaeologist who originally found the 
four sacred swords. We obtained his files from the Neo-Japanese data 
banks, and we have much to learn still. Even he was unaware of their 
true power.&quot;

Zephaniah continued to scroll through the folder. &quot;So, roughly, what do 
you know? Other than the information we have already obtained?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; He began gradually. &quot;As you know, they were refined from the 
Genesis Comet ten years ago by the Japanese researcher, Keijiro Seisuji. 
After he extracted them, he did a study of all four. And discovered 
that-&quot;

Zephaniah held his hand up to stop the other man as he read a passage 
from Keijiro&#39;s notes.

&#39;November 12th, 2071. After 72 hours of continuous study and analysis, I 
have failed to discover just what the four swords are made of. Their 
material is lighter than bone, but strangely, I find it to be denser 
than pure titanium. Each sword seems to have an elemental property, and 
I have named each one according to its attribute. The first is the Wind 
Soul. I have named it this because it produces violent gusts of wind 
when held for extended periods of time. The second sword is the Fire 
Cutter. It produces extreme heat when touched, and this heat can be so 
fierce that the air molecules around it can burst into flame. The third 
sword I have named Lightning Tooth. It creates small discharges of 
electricity but for some reason, the material it is made of does not 
conduct electrical energy. The last sword, and arguably the most 
dangerous, is the Shadow Edge. It&#39;s material is a very dark black, with 
strange runic symbols scripted along the blade. When it is held for too 
long, tremors seem to erupt from the ground, ones that can shatter stone 
if intense enough. It randomly creates a barrier around itself to 
protect itself from people. Which leads me to believe its power was not 
meant to be used. All in all, the swords are in all probability the 
greatest discovery of the 21st Century, although we have yet to learn 
the true depths of their secrets. Three of them, the Wind Soul, the Fire 
Cutter and the Lightning Tooth, are made from the same substance (an 
unnaturally light but strong metal) but have different properties. Which 
leads me to believe that the swords were imbued with their attributes 
upon creation. However the Shadow Edge generates its own force, and I 
think the runic symbols scratched into it are a form of warning or 
precaution. But all attempts to translate these symbols have failed; 
they bear no resemblance to any recorded language in history. I will 
continue to research the four swords for as long as my grant funding 
will allow me to, but until I can get them to a legitimate laboratory, 
any and all results on the four swords will be ultimately inconclusive. 
Keijiro Seisuji. The Four Sword Study, excerpt 211.&#39;

Zephaniah sighed as he took this all in. The Shougatsu Financial Group 
was one of the few companies in the world that still had active 
technology and scientific laboratories, and if anyone could discover the 
secrets of the swords it would be them, but how long would that take?

&quot;Does he have more information in this?&quot; Zephaniah asked. 

&quot;Yes sir. He goes on to say that the powers of the swords can be 
manipulated in limitless amounts, which leads us to believe the 
Lightning Tooth could be the answer to the world&#39;s current energy 
problem. If it is in the possession of the Shougatsu Financial Group 
then the world will be at our feet.&quot;

Zephaniah shut the folder. &quot;Enough. I want those swords found, and I 
want them found now!&quot;

Black Star Nightclub, Nagoya, Neo-Japan

In its past, this club had been called &#39;Dead End&#39;. It suited the name 
well back then. The glamour of the surrounding walls and the lights that 
illuminated them could do nothing to shroud the sense of suffering and 
misery it contained. This was as true to the club in 2080 as it was in 
1994. Of course, it was not called &#39;Dead End&#39; anymore. Now it was known 
by the name Black Star. A reflection of the &#39;black star&#39;, the Genesis 
Comet, that had come down from the heavens and caused the world to fall 
to the same depravity that had been this club&#39;s mark. A sort of &#39;symbol 
of equalization&#39;. Just like its past, the Black Star nightclub was the 
hub of sleaze and corruption in the Neo-Japanese City of Nagoya. Full of 
drug dealers and drug users alike. A place where petty crime lords and 
their subordinates gathered in small numbers to discuss any dirty deal 
they might have on the cards. The large, smoke-filled hall was packed 
with circular tables (stained from abuse), banging neo-techno music, the 
shouts, jeers and laughter of the men inside it, as well as the giggling 
of the young waitresses who darted through the gaps between each table, 
handing drinks to lecherous men, dipping their &#39;snouts into the trough&#39;. 

This was Black Star. 

Of course, even in the thickest darkness, there is always a glimmer of 
light. Not everyone in the crowds of the Black Star nightclub could be 
held to scorn. There were some people in that place that could use this 
web of immorality as mask to remain inconspicuous. True to form, there 
was no better place to hide from attention than one that drew full 
attention. And one of those  said men sat at a corner table. Alone. 
Dressed in usual clothing, ordinary, average. Every now and again a 
waitress would walk up and offer him a refill for his empty shot glass 
of whiskey. He refused with a childish blush, even though he looked to 
be around 45 years in age. Soon enough the waitress would get the 
picture and buzz off, leaving this man behind to assume himself into the 
dark, smoky club. And he did this well. It was strange, considering that 
he was the only man in that nightclub who was of western descent. His 
pale white skin made him easy to pick out... but in a place where 
corruption was the name of the game, most people were too high on drugs 
&amp; alcohol (or themselves) to even care about the origins of this man. He 
continued to wait around for a while, taking great care in searching for 
someone. His eyes darted from one side of the large room to the other, 
looking for one person. One woman. He found her. 

Or rather, she found him.

The western man looked up as he felt a shadow being cast over him. And 
before long his dark eyes were taking in the sight a young woman. She 
was averagely tall for a female. Possessed of lengthy dark black hair 
tied behind her head into a ponytail. One that swung as low as her 
ankles. Dressed in an unusual set of clothing, a sort of black coat-vest 
over the top half of a white kimono, while the bottom half of the kimono 
was replaced with a pair of tight blue denims. Most eye catching of all 
was the sword and sheath at the girl&#39;s waist. A katana, owning a dim 
glow of strength all of its own. The silvery eyes of the youth looked 
down at the westerner. But he was the one with the questions.

&quot;Are you the one they refer to as The Dark Katana?&quot; Asked the older 
male, his voice marked with a decidedly Scottish accent.

&quot;I&#39;ve been called that sometimes,&quot; She replied, &quot;But I just prefer my 
clients to call me by my birth name. Ayame Nakagawa. And if you know 
that name then I can probably guess who you are. Simon McAmish, right?&quot; 

The Scot nodded to her. &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s me. Take a seat.&quot;

Ayame pulled a little smile and did as she was asked, sitting down upon 
the cushioned seat that surrounded that particular table like a 
compartment. Once one of the waitresses noticed that there was an 
addition to the table, she walked over to it with her little notepad in 
hand, her &#39;sinfully&#39; short skirt fluttering over the globes of her ass. 
Ayame&#39;s silvery eyes darted over to her left as the waitress approached 
swiftly.
 
&quot;Can I get you anything?&quot; Asked the waitress, looking at Ayame. 

The Dark Katana grinned a little, checking out the more glaring and 
appealing features of the Black Star club, in all its tight-breasted 
fury. &quot;Yeah honey, I&#39;ll have a beer. And make it an expensive one, since 
I&#39;m not paying.&quot;

The beautiful waitress nodded, turning to Simon. &quot;...And anything for 
you? This time?&quot;

&quot;Another whiskey would be fine.&quot; He claimed, shaking his empty shot 
glass at her for a brief second. The waitress nodded, wrote down the 
order and the table it was to be given to, then strode back out into the 
smoky climate of the room. While Simon got back into focus, the 
&#39;attentive&#39; Ayame couldn&#39;t help but whistle at the waitress&#39; cute little 
ass as it wiggled behind her in stride. If there was one thing she liked 
about this place, it was the waitresses. 

Simon, who didn&#39;t quite have such a demeaning view of the job, coughed 
into his fist to draw the attention back from the waitress. Ayame 
blinked and looked back, her concentration broken. It was now that she 
remembered just what she had been called here for. 

And Ayame addressed this. &quot;...I guess you must be one of those guys that 
don&#39;t like mixing business with a little pleasure. Fair enough. Lets 
just gets straight to business. What exactly do you want of me?&quot;

Simon&#39;s gaze turned melancholic, looking into his clutched hands. &quot;...I 
heard that you&#39;re the best at what you do. Even better than some of the 
elite of the Guardian Line. Which was why I need your talents. I need 
you to do a job for me. But it&#39;s not just... any job...&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the big deal?&quot; Ayame questioned, flicking a strand of dark hair 
out of her eyes, &quot;Is it an assassination or something? You know the 
Mazda Family are best suited to something like that. If you can afford 
them.&quot;

The Scottish man shook his head. &quot;No, it&#39;s not an assassination job.&quot;

&quot;Then what the hell is it?&quot;

&quot;I need you to...&quot; Simon took a deep breath, &quot;rescue someone for me.&quot;

Hearing that, Ayame froze. A rescue mission? &quot;Are you serious? You 
actually want me to save someone... for you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; Simon replied.

Ayame sighed before the older man, shutting her silvery eyes. &quot;Look man, 
I&#39;m not that kind of employee. I may take on the kind of jobs that the 
Guardian Line frown upon... but I&#39;m a professional at my work. I&#39;ve got 
no time for search-for-the-flag missions.&quot;

&quot;This is no ordinary mission,&quot; Mr. McAmish offered, &quot;Not even in the 
least. The person that I&#39;m asking you to rescue was not taken by a 
zealous ex-partner. This is no common domestic. The situation is far 
more serious than that. And if I&#39;m to get her back then I&#39;ll need 
someone with enough strength to get the job done.&quot;

Again, Ayame sighed. &quot;Okay then, keep your top on. What&#39;s the 
situation?&quot;

&quot;...It was almost a year ago,&quot; Simon began, &quot;I was working as usual back 
on the farm in my homeland of Scotland. I left the manor one day to head 
down to the market to buy some goods. Everything seemed fine at first. 
Then people began hearing talk of a group of soldiers hiding out 
somewhere in the village. I assumed they were just rumours so I took no 
notice of them. But by the time I got home... it was in ruins. My entire 
home was destroyed. My Father was unconscious, and my daughter was 
missing. Eventually I nursed my Father back into good health. And he 
told me that soldiers, dressed as those from the early half of the 
century, came in and kidnapped my daughter. I was... heartbroken and 
confused. Why on Earth would someone want to kidnap my sweet child?! I 
struggled to find an answer... and for months I hired dozens of 
detectives to figure out what had happened to my precious one. In the 
end I discovered that she had been taken to Neo-Japan. Or more 
specifically, a research facility on the edge of Nagoya.&quot;

By now, Ayame was quite focused. &quot;Research Facility?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Simon looked downwards again, &quot;...my daughter is a magic user. A 
person born with the power to manipulate magic. Some people call them 
&#39;Ashidah&#39;. I suspect that the reason my daughter was kidnapped was 
because of this power.&quot;

&quot;If this is all true, then it&#39;s a big league criminal issue,&quot; Ayame 
claimed, &quot;so then why not ask the government for help? Sure, they can 
drag their asses sometimes but they could take care of something like 
this far easier.&quot;

Simon shook his head. &quot;I tried that route. They told me that I didn&#39;t 
have concrete evidence that my daughter was kidnapped by these people. 
But the truth is, they&#39;re just scared of the power of the company 
funding the research. So if I can&#39;t get that place searched legally then 
I&#39;ll just have to do it illegally. Through you.&quot;

By now the drinks were ready. The waitress came back to the table with 
the two orders on a circular tray. She placed the drinks down, the beer 
to Ayame, the whiskey to Simon. Simon then handed her a few slips of yen 
from his wallet, and she left to attend to the needs of her other 
customers. A small silence filled the space between Ayame and Simon, 
which didn&#39;t last long.

After taking a swig of her beer, Ayame looked over at her employer. 
&quot;...I see. So you think that you might need a bit of force to get your 
daughter back? It does make sense. So what&#39;s this place called?&quot;

&quot;The Bio-Technological Research Department, Neo-Japan Branch.&quot;

&quot;And what company funds them?&quot;

Simon lowered his head. Here came the difficult part. &quot;The... Shougatsu 
Financial Group...&quot;

The very same second that she heard the name &#39;Shougatsu Financial 
Group&#39;, Ayame almost spewed up the gulp of beer she was taking down. The 
girl of eighteen years gave a stunned glimpse to Simon, completely 
thrown for six. &quot;The Shougatsu Financial Group?! THE Shougatsu Financial 
Group?! They&#39;re the most powerful conglomerate on the face of the 
planet! And though those guys may look innocent, everyone knows that 
they can&#39;t be trusted!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s them.&quot; The Scottish man confirmed. 

Ayame took a second to breathe. &quot;...Look man, the Shougatsu are not a 
joke. If you fuck with them then you better know what you&#39;re doing. It&#39;s 
gonna take a LOT of money for me to get involved with the likes of them. 
And that&#39;s the least of it. I know it might be a horrible thing to say, 
but how do you even know that your daughter&#39;s still alive? A year is a 
long time to be holding a person. If they really are conducting illegal 
experiments on her, then chances are she&#39;ll be killed as soon as they&#39;re 
done.&quot;

&quot;I have faith,&quot; Simon spoke with full determination, &quot;in my daughter&#39;s 
will to live. She&#39;ll not die before me. I&#39;m sure of it. I can feel it.&quot;

Ayame held a hand to her head. Though she had to admire this man&#39;s 
confidence, she couldn&#39;t shake that old feeling that getting into 
matters like this was a bad idea. &quot;...If I do take on this job, then how 
much are you willing to pay me for it?&quot;

Simon looked back up to eye-level. &quot;If you rescue my daughter... I&#39;ll 
pay you 11,000 credits. To be changed into any currency that you wish. 
You&#39;ll get 2,500 upfront and the other 8,500 if you find my daughter or 
bring back any information that tells me of her current status. Do you 
accept?&quot;

The red light was flicking in Ayame&#39;s mind. But it was a lot of money, 
and this man did seem to be confident that his daughter was alive. The 
Dark Katana took another gulp from her beer and then gave her answer. 
&quot;...I&#39;ll do it. I&#39;d be out of line to back out on you now.&quot;

A smile finally came to the Scottish man&#39;s face. &quot;Thank you. Thank you 
from the bottom of my heart. Now there are a few things I must give 
you.&quot;

He then went to his side and began pulling a few things out of his 
pocket. He placed them before Ayame, on the table. One was an envelop, 
stuffed with the upfront money that Simon had promised to give to Ayame 
straight off. The other two items were different. One was a sort of 
card, like an ID card. The other was a folded piece of paper, which 
Ayame could tell was a floor plan or layout for a building. 

&quot;This is the money I&#39;ll be paying you,&quot; Simon spoke, pointing at the 
envelope, &quot;This piece of paper is a blueprint of the Research Facility. 
It will show you where the best places are to look for my daughter. And 
the card is an ID Key. Though technology was weakened by the impact of 
the Genesis Comet, the Shougatsu are beginning to re-cultivate it. Their 
laboratories will be full of technology. Use this card to get you 
through the automatic locks and such that you are bound to face.&quot;

Ayame heaved a sigh. It looked like she had gotten herself into another 
mess... &quot;So what&#39;s your daughter&#39;s name?&quot;

&quot;Julia,&quot; Simon said, &quot;My daughter, Julia McAmish.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Western Courtyard, Yuuga school of Sword Arts, Neo-Japan

With his sword rested to one side of his body, Setsuya sat down on the 
cobblestone paving of the Western Courtyard of the Yuuga School. After 
his talk with Yurunosuke, he was beginning to wonder about certain 
things. 

Setsuya had learned a lot of things in his time; he valued his skills as 
a swordsman and his life as a traveller of the ruined world. But just 
recently, he had begun to question his purpose in the world. He often 
wondered, why didn&#39;t he ever settle down? Even though he was only 19, 
the expected lifetime of someone born after the landing of the Genesis 
Comet was 30. It was logical at these times for young men to seek out a 
family. But not for Setsuya. As he ran a hand through his smooth black 
hair, he remembered his old girlfriend back in China, the village girl, 
Lin-Lin. Setsuya had met Lin-Lin in the ruins of the outside world, near 
a small Chinese village. 

Setsuya had been travelling the countryside for a few hours, on a hunch 
about a bounty he was searching for; he heard a bunch of screams coming 
from deep inside the forest. When Setsuya heard this he instantly 
recognised this as a woman&#39;s scream. Not one to leave a damsel in 
distress, Setsuya heroically plunged himself into the thicket of the 
woods, and tracked down the woman screaming. He eventually found her, 
and saw that a wild boar was about to attack her. Animals born after the 
landing of the Genesis Comet were much stronger and bigger than ones of 
previous years, which meant more meat, but also made them tougher to 
kill. 

All the same, Setsuya was undaunted, and effortlessly slew the much 
larger boar. The girl was amazed at Setsuya&#39;s ability and was extremely 
thankful for his help, wrapping her arms around the taller man. She told 
Setsuya that her name was Lin-Lin, and she led him back to her village. 
The elders and Lin-Lin&#39;s parents were very thankful for what he did for 
Lin-Lin, and he stayed there for a short while. During that time, 
Lin-Lin fell in love with him, and they had a brief but passionate 
relationship. It was hard for Setsuya to leave, but he had to, he had an 
adventurous spirit burning inside. That was around five months ago. 
Setsuya couldn&#39;t say that he didn&#39;t miss Lin-Lin. Maybe it was time to 
visit her. 

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen Lin-Lin in a while.&quot; Setsuya mused privately. &quot;Maybe I 
should go back to China...&quot;

While Setsuya continued to think in his sitting position, a strong gust 
blew into the courtyard. The brunette man looked back, in the direction 
the breeze came from. And his eyes widened as he saw who it was. 

He was a young man, roughly the same height as Setsuya. His long 
ponytail of hair was a platinum blonde, and his marble-like eyes were a 
stern brown. In his hand was an unsheathed sword, with a strange aura 
about it. Fierce winds surrounded him as he walked forward, whipping up 
the dust and loose cobblestones around his feet. His face was sterile 
and docile, his walk was slow and paced, but it was obvious that this 
man had a mind riddled with intent. Soon his slow-paced walked ended, 
and he stood before Setsuya, his emotionless face staring down at the 
seated swordsman. 

&quot;...We meet again, Setsuya Seisuji.&quot; He said coolly. 

Setsuya grinned as he recognized this young man. With a defiant grin, 
the black-haired man stood up, clutching his sword along with him. 
Setsuya turned to face the blonde man behind him, looking into his eyes 
with re-stoked flames burning in his own. 

&quot;It&#39;s been a while... Aarin.&quot;
