<p>“Master of the World: a colossal  struggle to earn our freedom!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Chandra woke up peacefully, lying  naked in the short grass next to three of the most beautiful women  she had known. One of them was Valti Brignor, her curly brunette hair  waving in the soft wind, her six arms splayed out like a windmill,  her bare chest rising and falling with each soft breath; the other  two were the twins, Kayleigh and Teleah, their single fused body  faintly tanned from the hours spent sunning, their heads leaning in  towards each other, almost close enough to touch. Chandra couldn’t  understand how people could call these women monsters or freaks: they  were both so gorgeous to her, and surprisingly sexual, judging from  the way they behaved the night before.</p>
<p>And the night before that. But her  thoughts wandered. She drew her new friends closer to her, feeling  strong electric pulses go through her skin, muscles, blood, and  bones, into her brain to saturate the whole body. She had been made  for sex, sex with women only, but it was not a curse or a burden or a  destiny to be detested: she loved her work and was thankful every day  for the twisted designs of the man (or the woman!) who had given her  this passion. She would have laid there for days on end, just staring  at her lovers, anticipating the moment when they woke up and resumed  their threesome, if not for the noise that was rising over the  distance.</p>
<p>“”Yes, I see your point, dear,  you’d make an excellent instructor, I’m just not convinced of  your sanity, after all, you have started plenty of fires, right,  you’re a menace to society, however, I consider you a friend,  because you really are a genius, and I was hoping, erm, to benefit  from that mind of yours, Kyrie dear, I’ve been looking to invest in  technology, can’t have the Demises hog it all, right, well, I say,  look at what we have here, the lovebirds have finally gone asleep!”</p>
<p>“Hello, Vimmy,” Chandra sighed.  She perked up as she saw Kyrie approaching, and cute little Sharyn  was not too far off. “Hello, my hot little flame champion! Did you  have a good sleep?” She made a face and shivered.</p>
<p>“It’s cold out here.”</p>
<p>“That’s not a problem for you,  Pyrosians can make a fire out of anything, I swear she was <em>breathing</em> it a moment ago, Chandra, so have you three finished with your romp,  I’m glad you found time to make love while the rest of us worked so  hard, you should really be more considerate, we got a lot done, and  what have you lazy people been up to, eh, I’ll warrant it’s  nothing constructive, why, my dear friend Sharyn has actually cleared  her debt to me recently, she’s at least as good as Mink in a pinch,  gods how I miss her!” She sighed, and that seemed to be the end of  her tirade. Ah, Vimmy--always so concerned about everybody’s  welfare, and how she could turn that into a profit.</p>
<p>“What’s all the commotion?”  Valti groaned as she slowly sat up, rubbing her face. “Can’t a  sin against nature get some beauty sleep? I was having quite a dream.  Oh, you’re back!” She stretched her limbs and slowly stood up,  perfectly naked and probably better off for it: she just </p>
<p>didn’t ooze the same kind of charm  in a lab coat. “Vimmy, I think I heard everything you said, or got  the gist of it at least, so shut your mouth and make yourself useful.  God, I’m starving!”</p>
<p>“How selfish, and rude, and…and  inconsiderate, yes, because if you’ve really been listening to what  I say, you’d know--”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” Kyrie and Valti  barked. Vimmy shrunk back and did as she was told; the two former  lovers grinned at each other.</p>
<p>“You’d better give us the  report, Kyrie,” Valti pointed as she hunted for her clothes.  “You’re the best that we have right now. Sharyn will just flower  hers up, and letting Vimmy do it would be a waste. We could sit here  for days and never learn anything.”</p>
<p>“I heard that!” Vimmy exclaimed,  adding a few complaints that nobody cared to hear. Kyrie took a deep  breath and sat down, worn-out from her search.</p>
<p>“Well, let me see. Where should I  begin? Aside from the grove and the river we found the other day,  there also seems to be some kind of temple. It was too far for us to  reach last night, and we had to deal with wild animals. I gotta hand  it to Sharyn: she’s one hell of a warrior. Anyway, we were thinking  that if you’re all up to it, we could visit this temple and see if  any of our friends are there.”</p>
<p>“What kind of place is it?”  Valti asked, now almost completely dressed. Kyrie shrugged.</p>
<p>“No idea. We just spotted it from  a distance. There shouldn’t be anything stopping us from getting  there, except Vimmy’s whining. Hey Chandra, feel like hiking a few  kilos today?”</p>
<p>“Must I?” she sighed dejectedly.  Kyrie smiled sadly.</p>
<p>“Afraid so, unless you wanna stay  here forever.”</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t be so bad,” she  giggled, running her hand over the Acherons’ bare chest. This  stirred them, and they were greeted with kisses. Tee wanted to sneak  off and finish what they had started, but Kay, admittedly the more  responsible one (and the one least likely to get laid), wanted to go  look for the temple. The vote was 3-2 in favor of leaving, and once  Sharyn and Vimmy got back, it became a landslide.</p>
<p>The green-skinned knight errant  brought back news, water, and enough food to last the group three  days if they rationed it carefully. The path to the temple was clear,  she said, but she had a bad feeling about that ancient place. From  what she could tell, spying at it from so far away that it looked  like a blur, it was more like a pile of rubble than a building, and  no living creature, not even a bird, dared to go near it.</p>
<p>“Cool!!” Kyrie squealed. “That  means we get to be explorers! We’ll be the first ones there and  make history!!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“First we gotta get there,”  Valti reminded her. The six women divided the supplies between them  (poor Chandra and Vimmy, being forced to carry luggage like a pack  mule!) and headed off, putting out the dying fire and erasing any  sign that they had been camping there.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>The first day they spent in this  inhospitable environment had been rough, needless to say. One would  think that large numbers would be easier for survival--there’d be  more people to assign tasks to, and the company would keep one sane  until rescue arrived--but such fantasies were best left for the  stories. Chandra predictably whined and moaned half the time, being  accustomed to a life of relative luxury (the rest of the time, she  spent seducing and making love to her fellow castaways), and Vimmy  was even worse, cursing and ranting for hours at a time, until at  last, despite her lengthy protests, she was put to work. The others,  thankfully, were up to the challenge, especially Kyrie and Sharyn,  who were both looking for a chance to prove themselves. They teamed  up several times to go looking for food and water, and even though  they could barely tolerate one another’s strange quirks, they  somehow managed to become friends.</p>
<p>Valti was a geneticist, not an  architect, yet she and the Acheron sisters coordinated and built a  shelter fairly quickly. Chandra was finally put to use as she started  to weave crude blankets and tarps together (sewing was, believe it or  not, a skill she possessed); Vimmy was reduced to being a gofer.  Thanks to this stilted teamwork, the crew was able to survive two  days in moderate comfort, but now that their scouts had picked up  signs of civilization, they were ready to move, and hopefully, find  their friends.</p>
<p>The distance really was not that  bad: six or seven kilometers, easily crossed in about an hour with  breaks added in (Vimmy usually perched on Valti’s shoulders).  Before long, everyone could see the temple in the distance, appearing  first as a mirage. A few steps later, and the blurs became solid,  then well-defined, then sharply realistic. The thing sported a  shadow, something no mirage could hold, and finally became  three-dimensional, a fairly large monument to some primordial power  that had visited this world thousands (or tens of thousands) of years  earlier. Its ruination was nearly complete; the building was scarcely  more than a large pile of rubble, overgrown with lichen, moss, ivy,  and fungus as tough as leather. Sharyn’s description had not been  completely accurate, for a few flies, ants, butterflies, and bees  crawled around the temple, the last and bravest remnants of its  population. The entrance was completely covered by pillars that had  fallen over, thanks to age or an earthquake, and there was no other  way inside.</p>
<p>“Helloooooo!!” Valti shouted.  “Is there anybody around here? Amy, Lyara? Mink, Eve, Fuuka? Kate,  Lil…anybody?”</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me we came out here  for nothing,” Tee muttered.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Although it would be a nice  rallying point,” Kay thought.</p>
<p>“There’s no point in that if  nobody else is around.”</p>
<p>“Then we’d just have to keep  looking for them. I’m saying this could be our base.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, a few curtains and lamps,  and this place will be just like home!”</p>
<p>“Don’t get so discouraged! I  swear, you’re always the first to go negative.”</p>
<p>“It’s called realism, sister.”</p>
<p>“Hush, both of ye!” Sharyn  hissed, raising her hand up. “Lest mine eyes are deceptive, there  is more to this sanctuary than ruins. I doth spot an altar.” She  gestured for everybody to follow her, quietly, and snuck around the  building to its rear, where a grassy stone pathway led away from the  temple, towards a large, lengthy staircase that rose about fifty  meters into the air. This construction was in much better shape:  although it was still covered with growth, the stairs seemed solid,  and not a single pebble was out of place. Runes were carved along  each inclination, and at the very top, a magnificent archway opened  up a pathway to the sun itself. But the most alarming thing about  this altar was not what it looked like, or its amazing survival, but  what was chained at the very top, still and silent.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Rachel.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Oh my god,” Valti murmured, “we  found her. I can’t believe we found the little troublemaker. If I  hadn’t enjoyed myself so much, I’d throttle her.”</p>
<p>“Is she asleep?” Tee wailed.  “Has she been here this entire time? Don’t tell me that we’d  have to bring that bookworm with us to wake her up!”</p>
<p>“Shut your mouth and open your  eyes,” her sister snapped, momentarily breaking out of her peaceful  character. “Don’t you see? Rachel’s chained to that archway.  It’s like she’s a sacrificial maiden or something.”</p>
<p>“Would that we knew the when and  wherefore,” Sharyn whispered. “I would charge in and rescue this  lady were it not for the sinking feeling in my gut.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes, I’ve got a bad feeling  as well,” Vimmy whined, “but we shouldn’t let that stop us,  gracious no, why, if we just walk up there and slap some sense into  her, we’ll be out of here, yes, we need to wake her up so we can  get out, who cares how she got there, we just need to--”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“All right, we get the point!”  Kyrie snarled. She sighed wearily, just as eager to leave all this  behind as anybody else, and since she was now Sharyn’s friend, she  followed her as the warrior drew her blade, creeping up one step at a  time. Valti started waving her arms once they got about halfway.</p>
<p>“Rachel!” The genie didn’t  stir. The seven women took two more steps and called out to her  again, but before they could take a third, the ground trembled,  throwing them off balance. Kyrie fell down the stairs but flapped her  wings before she crashed into anything, and floated to safety; she  even caught Chandra. Valti balanced herself with her arms, Sharyn her  sword, and the twins showed incredible reflexes as they clung to the  stairs like a spider. It was not an earthquake causing this sudden  shift--more like a monster coming to life. At that moment, Rachel  woke up, and had about half a second to warn her friends.</p>
<p>“Hey guys, long time no see!”</p>
<p>What a waste. A long appendage swept  over the stairs, knocking back everyone, and the monster revealed  itself in all its colossal glory. The animal had a head shaped like a  horseshoe, with three eyes on both sides, horns at the top, and two  more underneath. It had a cavernous mouth with two rows of sharp  teeth, much like a shark’s, and it crawled around on six powerful  legs that ripped the earth apart with frightening claws. Two long,  slender, piercing tails danced in the air as the monster searched for  its prey; spines on its back shifted noisily, warning any competitors  and stunning its prey. This was the master of the world, the being  that the ancients constructed their temples and ziggurats for, a  creature Valti identified as a Tyranohex, wielder of six tyrannical  dooms.</p>
<p>“SHIT!!” Kyrie roared. “Where  in the FUCK did that thing come from?!”</p>
<p>“It’s been here all this time,  guarding Rachel. We just didn’t see it because it was camouflaged  so well.”</p>
<p>“Nice analysis, professor!! Now  tell us what the hell this thing is and how we can kill it!” The  beast was livid with rage; it chased after the six small creatures  with savage lust, thrusting its tails around like spears, bowing its  head to catch unwary prey on its horns, its teeth grinding with an  everlasting hunger. Rachel was awake but useless: for some reason,  she just couldn’t get away from her prison. Valti tried her best to  explain it, but she had to run and hide at full speed, while trying  to remember the Tyranohex’s weakness.</p>
<p>In summary, these very rare beasts  were semi-intelligent predators that normally roamed the land in  search of prey. They did not hunt so much as find animals by chance,  but the chase was never very long: beasts were usually impaled by its  sharp tails, or gored on its horns, and thrust into its mouth where  everything was devoured, bones and all. They had no natural enemies  and had been revered as terrifying gods by the primeval inhabitants  of this world. But they only ate flesh as a last resort: their true  diet consisted of magical energy, slowly drained from a living  creature until every last drop had been stolen (this had been  difficult for the scientific community to prove, so a handful of  brave elves had volunteered to demonstrate on a few small pups). When  the <em>Dauntless</em> flew over his world, the Tyranohex sensed  Rachel’s presence and caused her to go berserk, </p>
<p>drawing her into his clutches. It  was then a matter of finding her and binding her, summoning arcane  skills from untold epochs ago, long before the genies themselves came  into existence. This was why Rachel had lost control of her powers,  and why she had been unable to help anybody.</p>
<p>But all that was meaningless for the  moment: there was still a deadly predator to fight, and if the women  wanted off that planet, they would have to kill the Tyranohex  first--certainly not an easy task. He had an excellent defense, plus  power and speed on his side, but the Tyranohex did have one weakness,  and luckily, Valti had studied them for awhile during her days at  university. She just couldn’t remember what it was yet…</p>
<p>“Valti!” Kyrie screamed. “Any  time now!”</p>
<p>“Hold on a minute, I’m thinking!  It’s been a long time since I studied these things!”</p>
<p>“Think harder! Eep!” Kyrie’s  upper arm was slashed as she rolled away from the piercing tails;  Vimmy and Chandra were taking refuge with Rachel, which was actually  the safest place to be. There was no way the Tyranohex would attack  them and risk harming his delicious banquet. Sharyn had drawn her  sword and was using it well, striking back at the tails as they  lashed out, and even attacked the head, though the thrashing horns  made things more difficult. The Acheron twins hung back--not because  they were helpless, but to study their foe and discern any patterns  or weak spots. They thought they saw something odd when the monster  turned around, exposing the back of its neck, and called out for  Valti.</p>
<p>“Hey, what about the creature’s  neck? We thought we saw something!”</p>
<p>“That’s it!” Valti roared.  “Sharyn, plunge your sword into its nape! That’s the only part of  the Tyranohex we can harm!”</p>
<p>“Aye!” She ran off, her voice  undulating in a battle-cry, her sword glimmering in the sun. But even  with Sharyn’s powerful Lesser Armor, she would not last long unless  the monster had somebody distracting it.</p>
<p>“You two, up there!” Kay shouted  to Vimmy and Chandra. “Start throwing things at it! Rocks, sticks,  doesn’t matter! Kyrie, can you get a fire going?”</p>
<p>“Way ahead of you!” she cried.  The Pyrosian found an isolated spot, and quick as a wink, she got a  blaze going (Reds can start fires just about anywhere, from anything,  at anytime, if they are pressed to). “Now what!?”</p>
<p>“We’ll need torches! Valti, we  need you to help us burn the tails off.”</p>
<p>“I copy that. Kyrie, see if you  can’t make a wall of fire so the Tyranohex doesn’t run too far  away! Make it as hot as you can!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“AS HOT AS I CAN?!” she  screeched, overwhelmed with joy. “Valti, if we hadn’t broken up,  I’d kiss you right now! AWRIGHT, sucker!! It’s time you learned  to fear the BURNING PASSION of Kyrie Lastgear!! Don’t say I didn’t  warn you all!” While Kyrie was allowing herself to be possessed,  Sharyn finally made it to the rampaging Tyranohex. She jumped as high  as she could, grabbed its coarse, thick fur, and started to climb up  to its back. The monster felt her pulling against him, and slapped  his body with his tails, sometimes missing her, sometimes not. The  appendages bounced off her thick body armor, but it didn’t offer  total protection: Sharyn was still stunned, and even lost her grip  once or twice. As she crawled up to its back, taking refuge amidst  its plated spines, Valti and the Acheron sisters approached from the  sides, wary of the trampling legs. Chandra and Vimmy were throwing  everything they could get their hands on, even clumps of moss, and  with such a large monster, it was hard to miss. Several sticks and  stones struck the Tyranohex in its eyes, and one even got caught in  its mouth, freezing it just long enough for Valti and the twins to  act.</p>
<p>“Up ya go!” Valti helped boost  the twins up, and with six arms aiding her, easily managed to shimmy  onto the monster’s large back. The women immediately painted the  piercing tails with their torches, setting them ablaze just in time  for Sharyn to strike.</p>
<p>“AVALON!” she cried as she took  a running start and rammed her sword deep into the beast’s neck.  The Tyranohex roared and thrashed in pain, but only fought harder,  desperate to stay alive. Kyrie’s wall of fire was starting to  really grow, and every time the monster summoned the courage to  approach it, the intense heat drove him back. Kyrie herself burst  through the flames like the demon she was, wielding a large branch  smothered with flames.</p>
<p>“Sharyn, hit it again!” she  shouted. The emerald knight was happy to oblige; she plunged her  blade even deeper than before, all the way up to its hilt, and had to  utilize all her strength just to pull it back out. As the Tyranohex  reared back in agony, Kyrie threw her fire into its mouth, cackling  wickedly.</p>
<p>“Smile, you son of a bitch!” The  beast’s tails broke off as it grumbled and whined, slamming the  ground with its paws and horns, and Valti and the twins grabbed the  pointed tips, which were easily bigger than a no-dachi. Together they  charged in with Sharyn, thrusting their weapons into its weak spot  for the last time. The beast let out a final anguished howl, and  collapsed on the ground, utterly defeated. Rachel was freed the  instant the Tyranohex breathed its last, and they all rested from  their exhausting trial.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>And so, the days spent on that  distant, primitive world came to a close. Rachel easily honed in on  Aseria’s light signal, and picked up a relieved Sindar and a very  happy gunslinger. She flew over Alala and Yenae’s camp, pausing  briefly to stare as they snuggled together, and coughed to woke them  up, suppressing a few giggles. Riene, Rebecca, and Lyara seemed cold  and distant as </p>
<p>Rachel swooped down to save them,  but despite their somber moods, they were all very grateful. Fuuka  and Kate laughed as they waved for Rachel; Lillianne and Naja sighed,  glad that the ordeal was over.</p>
<p>“Maybe now I can finally make it  to Saigrim,” the Elshyrin pouted.</p>
<p>“First we have to find the  others,” Lil reminded her. “The <em>Dauntless</em> just isn’t the  same unless everybody’s on there, although we could’ve done  without the bitch meat.</p>
<p>“Amen!” Fuuka and Athena  showered each other with kisses as they were reunited, and Eve, Mink,  Herut, and Shana were greeted with cheers and hugs as they joined the  rest of their friends. Finally, it was time for master and servant to  come together, and as Amy Miracle observed her friend descending from  the sky, she snuck away for a moment to bid Ferrara farewell.</p>
<p>“Even though my friends might  never see you the same way that I have, I hope you and I can meet  again later.”</p>
<p>“It’s possible,” the harpy  smiled. She bent down to kiss Amy’s cheek--she had wanted a more  intimate kiss, but didn’t see the point since there was no way they  could be together. Amy returned the gesture softly, and turned away  to rejoin her friends. With Rachel’s assistance, the <em>Dauntless</em> was brought out of a dead orbit and onto the surface, where everyone  gained a new appreciation of their “home” as they boarded.  Ferrara watched the vessel leave forlornly; Changera, approaching the  ruined temple and the remains of the Tyranohex, had a colder glint in  her eye. Needless to say, this was not the last time the crew would  run into their rivals!</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Four days after losing its crew on  the nameless planet, the <em>Dauntless</em> took off to the stars,  ready for its next adventure.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p></p>
<p>　</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Vimmy: Gracious, we’re barely  inside our rooms and Chandra gets right down to business, I suppose a  drive like that is admirable, but doesn’t she have any other  hobbies, a lady can’t live on love alone, she must expand her mind  for other pursuits, don’t you think so?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kyrie: I was actually hoping I’d  get lucky, but whatever! The next chapter FINALLY brings us to  Saigrim, where Naja finds an artifact that she believes can save her  from being forced to get married! You go, Naja! Fight the powers that  be!</p>
<p>Sharyn: Yet I hath a negative  sentiment concerning this adventure. Perhaps I should venture with  Ladies Miracle and Elapidae and offer my guidance and protection.</p>
<p>Kyrie: Don’t tell me YOU have a  crush on Amy as well!</p>
<p>Sharyn: WHA?! How didst thou…ack!  N-ne’er ye mind! T-tis’ merely my duty which compels me, and  naught else.</p>
<p>Vimmy: Ahuh, rightly so, but  denial’s a rather frail state of mind, I think, though I don’t  know what’s so attractive about Dr. Miracle, I mean, she’s not  rich or anything, if all she has to offer is 10,000 G, but it doesn’t  matter, the next chapter shows us the importance of taking the long  way around, yes?</p>
<p>Kyrie: Is that what that is? Stay  tuned for “The Nail of Saigrim: a grave situation?”</p>
<p>Sharyn: Perhaps now is not the best  time to proclaim my love for Fuji-san, either…</p>
<p>Kyrie and Vimmy: (She’s as bad as  Riene!)</p>
