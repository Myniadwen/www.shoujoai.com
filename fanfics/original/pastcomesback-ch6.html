<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 6 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>      Tsuki was still in a daze at Krystal&#39;s power, so much so that it was making the blonde 
woman uncomfortable. Hina came into the room and smiled at her older sister. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s 
lunch time, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

      The brunette snapped out of her thoughts to look at the younger girl. &quot;Oh... yeah, 
you&#39;re right. I will go get started on that - will you help me Hina?&quot;

      Krystal watched the two of them head out of the room and Tsuki stopped. &quot;Krystal? Our 
big sister isn&#39;t back yet, so maybe you could go get her? She&#39;s somewhere near the 
waterfall.&quot;

      From the smile on Tsuki&#39;s face, Krystal assumed this would be her chance to meet the 
mysterious woman. &quot;Sure, I&#39;ll go find her.&quot; As she stood up, she could feel herself get 
dizzy. All that work with seals was exhausting...

      She exited the shrine through the backyard and remembered Hina pointing out that the 
waterfall was on the left path. Krystal sighed, trying not to trip over herself. The 
training was much harder than she thought... No wonder Hina and Tsuki took so many breaks.

      Krystal wondered what Isaka was doing... maybe spending time with Tycara? Yeah, that&#39;s 
probably it. She could hear rushing water and smiled to herself. It was actually quite hot 
so maybe she&#39;d wash her face to cool down.

      The waterfall was kind of small, but it was still very beautiful. Krystal sat down 
next to the bank and proceeded to wash her face... Then she suddenly remembered that she was 
supposed to be looking for Hina and Tsuki&#39;s big sister.

      There was no one else there. Krystal stood up and looked around, unable to find any 
trace of another woman. Great... had she already headed back? Deciding to wait for a bit, 
Krystal picked up a stone and tossed it in the air.

      Maybe she&#39;d train a bit - she sent out her spirit thread to capture the rock, but it 
missed. The rock hit the ground with a plop. Awesome - she totally sucked. Even her one 
thread wasn&#39;t that great. She kept trying and as such was unaware of the presence behind 
her.

      She had the rock in her hand, ready to toss it when she felt one arm wrap around her 
waist and another hand place itself over her own. &quot;You have to act as though the spirit 
thread is an extension of your hand, not just a tool.&quot;

      Krystal gulped at the silky voice next to her ear. She could feel a warm body pressing 
just a little too close to her and she vaguely thought of Isaka. If the demon were here, 
someone would be getting hurt. It brought a little smile to her face and she said, 
&quot;Alright...&quot;

      The hand on her own let go and Krystal tossed up the stone. When she sent out the 
thread, she imagined it was her own hand grabbing the stone and... it worked!

      &quot;Oh wow! Hey, I actually caught!&quot; In her excitement, Krystal forgot about the stranger 
intimately pressed up against her and the stone in the air. She accidentally tugged the rock 
towards her and Krystal soon found her forehead making an intimate acquaintance with the 
rock.

      &quot;Ouch!&quot; She could feel the area swelling and throbbing with dull pain.

      &quot;Oh, are you alright?&quot; The woman with the seductive voice helped Krystal sit down and 
grabbed her face to look at the wound. &quot;It looks like it might bruise, but... that&#39;s about 
it.&quot;

      Krystal let her eyes focus on the woman in front of her, who appeared to be a few 
years older than herself. She was very beautiful, with oddly silver hair and hazel-yellowish 
eyes. Her hair was up in a neat ponytail, the tie wrapped with a ribbon with symbols like 
the ones decorating Tsuki&#39;s arm. The blonde wasn&#39;t too comfortable with how close their 
faces were right now.

      &quot;I&#39;m sure it will heal up fine,&quot; the mystery woman said, suddenly kissing the bump on 
her forehead. Krystal almost jerked back in surprise. &quot;There. Nothing a kiss won&#39;t fix.&quot; She 
smiled as she said that, making Krystal feel like a young child.

      Somehow, the woman didn&#39;t seem to want to let go of Krystal. &quot;My sisters told me you 
were pretty, but I suppose that was an understatement...&quot;

      Alright, alerts went off in her head and Krystal scooted away, putting a hand to her 
forehead. &quot;Uh... um, thank you for helping me with the spirit threads...&quot; The woman was 
wearing white robes that made her seem like a celestial creature rather than a normal human. 
Krystal turned away and focused on healing the bump.

      &quot;So you can heal as well?&quot; Krystal looked over at her surprise as she took her hand 
away from her forehead. &quot;Yes... yes I can. Tsuki said none of you could do that...&quot;

      The other woman nodded and as she stood up, Krystal could hear a slight jingling. She 
was holding a staff, the top part formed in a hollow circle with rings aligning it. The 
blonde thought it was an odd weapon, but said nothing.

      &quot;Ah, I haven&#39;t introduced myself to you, have I Krystal? I was so caught up with 
helping you that I forgot.&quot; A smile tugged at the silver haired woman&#39;s lips. &quot;My name is 
Hoshi. Sorry I have been so scarce around here - I&#39;ve been busy with my own personal 
training.&quot;

      Hina, Tsuki, Hoshi. Krystal was sure there had to be something behind those names, but 
she merely followed Hoshi back to the shrine, careful not to get too close to the regal 
woman.  

***** 

      &quot;My sisters tell me you&#39;re good at channeling your energy.&quot; Krystal looked up from her 
bowl of rice to see Hoshi staring directly at her with a kind smile on her face. Lunch 
consisted of seasoned chicken and rice accompanied by fruits and vegetables.

      &quot;Uh, I&#39;m okay at it. It&#39;s really the only reason why I&#39;ve been able to fight off most 
demons.&quot; Krystal suddenly felt the urge to squirm beneath all three gazes. Hoshi set down 
her now empty bowl.

      &quot;If you don&#39;t mind Krystal, I would love to practice with you.&quot; Her two sisters began 
to giggle and Krystal looked around.

      &quot;Ah, sorry, haha,&quot; Tsuki said, smiling. &quot;Big sister is really good - even me and Hina 
can&#39;t bring her down together.&quot;

       Oh wow. No pressure. Hina gave her a reassuring smile before returning to eating. 
Krystal looked down at her bowl, wishing she had eaten slower so she could stall her 
imminent doom at the hands of Hoshi.

      &quot;Alright, sounds like fun!&quot; Krystal said, getting up. She followed Hoshi to another 
room that reminded her of dojos in martial arts movies.

      &quot;Well, we don&#39;t want to hurt each other, so...&quot; Hoshi grabbed two wooden swords from a 
closet containing many weapon replicas. &quot;It should be about the same weight as the sword you 
use,&quot; she said, smiling.

      Krystal took it in her hands and looked over at Hoshi. Were they really going to 
fight? She watched the older woman get in a stance and Krystal tried to do that herself, 
only to get a confused look from her sparring partner. &quot;Is that how you normally stand to 
fight?&quot;

      Looks like she already embarrassed herself... &quot;Well, I never got actual sword 
training... I just kind of feel it, you know?&quot;

      Hoshi just nodded, but the secret smile on her face made Krystal uncomfortable. &quot;I 
will come at you, then.&quot;

      Krystal barely had time to block the onslaught and found the wooden tip pointed at her 
throat in a few minutes. Hoshi stepped and sighed. &quot;I suppose you weren&#39;t really taught how 
to fight, but rather how to take out demons... could you channel your holy power into that 
weapon?&quot;

      That was easy - she could do that. Krystal calmed herself and watched the piece of 
wood glow with a white light. She could feel the presence of Hina and Tsuki in the room, 
presumably to watch her get the stuffing beaten out of her by Hoshi.

      Speaking of which, the woman across of her had channeled her energy as well. &quot;Alright 
Krystal - I want to see if you can block my attack. Come at me with everything you have!&quot;

      Krystal watched as Hoshi came at her with her sword now filled to brim with energy. 
She could do nothing as the holy blade came crashing at her, except block.

      Hina and Tsuki gasped as there was splinter of wood and a groan of pain. Krystal stood 
still before opening her eyes. She&#39;d merely held her sword up to the blow and all around her 
were splinter. Hoshi was holding the splintered handle of her weapon and clutching her head. 
She&#39;d gotten hit by a chunk of wood when her sword blew apart.

      Hoshi began to laugh. &quot;My, my! You certainly weren&#39;t joking when you said you were 
good at this. You completely overpowered and destroyed my weapon. Good job.&quot; Krystal let out 
a relieved sigh.

      &quot;Are you okay Hoshi? I didn&#39;t mean for you to get hurt-&quot;

      The older woman waved it off. &quot;No, no. It&#39;s just a little bump on the head... unless 
you want to kiss it to make it feel better?&quot; Krystal shook her head, eliciting another laugh 
from the silver haired woman. 

***** 

      &quot;You... you&#39;re staying over?!&quot; Isaka wasn&#39;t happy and Krystal had to hold the phone 
away from her ear at the demon&#39;s cry.

      &quot;Yeah, they say my seals need major work so we&#39;re having a sleepover seal practice 
thing. I think,&quot; Krystal murmured, sitting on the bed in the guest room. It was a comfy bed, 
but Hina said they were going to be using sleeping bags in the main room so they could 
practice.

      &quot;Ohh... but that means you have to make it up for me,&quot; Isaka said, her voice becoming 
husky. Krystal giggled.

      &quot;Hmm, I suppose... I&#39;ll be sure to wear something nice...&quot;

      She could hear some shifting on the other line. &quot;Really? How about... how about that 
thing we bought a little while ago?&quot;

      Krystal sighed. &quot;Of course - but don&#39;t get worked Isaka. I won&#39;t be back until the 
evening, so be good. I don&#39;t want you to get horny and try to call me up for phone sex.&quot;

      &quot;You still haven&#39;t let that go? It was only for a few minutes and it was last year,&quot; 
Isaka whined. &quot;Plus, you were really into it too!&quot;

      &quot;I have to go Isaka,&quot; Krystal said, hearing knocking on her door. &quot;I love you.&quot;

      &quot;I love you too, come back soon!&quot;

      The call ended and Krystal opened the door to see Hina holding a towel and a set of 
pajamas. &quot;It&#39;s bath time, Krystal! We&#39;re all stinky from training, so come on!&quot; She took the 
clothes and the towel, following Hina down the hall.

      &quot;Thanks for the clothes.&quot; The blonde girl turned around and grinned. &quot;Of course! 
They&#39;re big sister&#39;s so they may be a bit big.&quot;

      They had small chat until Hina came to a set of double sliding doors. She slid them 
open without hesitation. Krystal probably would have admired the artificial hot springs... 
with water flowing into the shallow pool, fake rocks here and there and even the traditional 
wood lining to the spring.

      Unfortunately, her head snapped to the side upon the sight of Tsuki&#39;s very naked self 
perched on the edge and pouring water on herself. The brunette turned around when they 
entered, smiling. &quot;Oh hey. The spring is nice and warm.&quot;

      Hina grinned. &quot;Alright!&quot; Krystal watched, or watched and turned away, when Hina 
started to disrobe. The adolescent practically sprinted and jumped in, spraying her older 
sister with water. &quot;Hina!&quot; She got a little splash because of it.

      Krystal was still staring at them, for now the edge of the pool hid their nudity as 
the two girls frolicked and played like... well, Krystal didn&#39;t have a sister, so she wasn&#39;t 
sure if this was how it really worked. After a while, the two girls noticed that Krystal was 
still standing with the pajamas and the towel.

      &quot;Krystal, you can just set your clothes and towel aside,&quot; Tsuki said, currently 
holding her sister.

      &quot;Yeah! The water&#39;s really nice,&quot; Hina said, suddenly splashing at Tsuki, causing the 
brunette to erupt in a fit of giggles.

      &quot;A...alright,&quot; Krystal murmured, setting aside her stuff. This made her feel like she 
was cheating on Isaka... She turned away from the two, who were now washing themselves with 
soap, and began to remove her shirt.

      As it was over her head, she felt a hand tug on her pants. Krystal jerked up and heard 
a silky laugh. She pulled the shirt all the way off and looked to see a towel clad Hoshi 
trying to help her with her pants. &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to startle you,&quot; the woman said 
with a smile. &quot;You just seemed to be moving rather... slow?&quot;

      &quot;I... I don&#39;t need any help,&quot; Krystal stammered out, now rushing out of her pants and 
taking off her undergarments.

      &quot;Just making sure. Don&#39;t be so shy - we&#39;re all girls aren&#39;t we?&quot; As if on cue, she 
could hear the laughing of the two other sisters. Hoshi stepped away and headed towards the 
spring, her towel dropping nonchalantly.

      Krystal was sure she was in a porn movie. Her, one lesbian, in a room - check, hot 
spring - with three, beautiful sisters. Great. She cautiously went to the water once the 
three females were looking a different way.

      The four of them started to exchange small talk, as though them all being naked was 
cool. Krystal tried to relax and as she started to wash herself, she felt Hoshi&#39;s presence. 
&quot;Do you need help washing your hair?&quot;

      Honestly, she was relieved it wasn&#39;t her back she was asking about. &quot;I think I got 
it,&quot; Krystal said, but Hoshi already had the shampoo in her hands. Krystal faced the other 
way with a sigh as she felt strong, gentle hands work through her hair. She could feel 
Hoshi&#39;s fingers stroke her scalp and found that the silver haired woman was quite good at 
it. Maybe she had lots of practice with her sister&#39;s...

      Speaking of which, she could see Tsuki washing Hina&#39;s hair with careful precision, the 
younger of them smiling happily at the attention.

      &quot;Tell me, Krystal,&quot; Hoshi said, her voice breaking through her thoughts. &quot;Do you have 
a significant other?&quot;

      Oh boy. &quot;Uh... yeah... yeah I do.&quot;

      &quot;Ah... okay.&quot; The hands stopped their rhythm and Krystal felt them on her shoulders, 
just a little too close to her chest. Krystal looked over her shoulder to find Hoshi closer 
than what was comfortable. &quot;Dip your head underwater, okay?&quot;

      &quot;Huh? Yeah, sure,&quot; Krystal said, bending her knees and completely submersing her head 
beneath the warm water. As she came back up, she felt Hoshi&#39;s hands wipe at the water in her 
eyes and when Krystal opened them, she found that she&#39;d somehow come up facing the other 
woman.

      Well, facing her and her well endowed body. Krystal looked away, only to catch a 
glimpse of Tsuki and Hina coming over.

      &quot;Heeey!&quot; Hina whined out. &quot;I wanted to wash Krystal&#39;s hair!&quot;

      Hoshi laughed and ruffled the young girl&#39;s wet head. &quot;Sorry - I didn&#39;t know. You must 
tell me things Hina.&quot;

      Tsuki looked over at Krystal inquisitively. &quot;Do you need help Krystal? You haven&#39;t 
really done much washing...&quot;

      Krystal held up her hands in defense. &quot;What? No no no. I&#39;m perfectly fine. I can take 
care of it myself.&quot;

      The two other sisters didn&#39;t seem to believe her. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; Hina asked, holding 
the soap.

      &quot;Yeah, I mean, you&#39;re probably used to a regular bathroom and not this,&quot; Tsuki added. 
Hoshi stood a little bit away, trying not to laugh at the situation.

      &quot;No, really! I&#39;m sure I&#39;m capable of washing myself!&quot;
