<a href="../original/allgirls-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;The Two Concluding Stories&quot;

Hitomi Madsen, bearing youth and an average, somewhat slender body, 
hummed her way down the halls to her classroom, the only place she 
called home outside her apartment. It was not really work, that 
Literature and Writing room; it was a second residence, somewhere she 
could be herself and yet her Other self--a refuge of kind, though one 
where she could do the least hiding. She would have to be the shaper, 
the molder, sometimes the hammer that struck the steel. Those girls 
would need to be in working shape for the world outside teenage 
adolescence, else she would never forgive her failures. She had hoped, 
as in ages past, that her successes would overcome and outnumber her 
failures, and many times she had succeeded. This year, she felt, would 
bring her no relief yet.

But by God, she loved it so.

Her humming slowed briefly, almost to a halt, as she opened the door and 
discovered all her students, even those she felt would be troublesome, 
had came in early. Every one of them. Her lips curled in approval, and 
with the hum still rippling in her throat, she graced herself down, 
picked up the list of their names, and gave them each three points. Not 
a word was said for some time, until she looked up from her work and 
studied them. By God, it was going to be a fun year. They all had such 
pretty eyes.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; she said at last. In harmony, more or less, they replied 
as follows: &quot;Good morning, Miss Madsen.&quot; Her smile broadened. &quot;And what 
a good morning it is. Wet yet fair, not quite crowned with chill. I 
don&#39;t believe I should insult any of you by wondering if you did your 
assigned works, but for academic&#39;s sake, I will have to check anyway. 
There are many of you and precious few minutes, so let us not waste 
time. Miss O&#39;Shannon, since you volunteered first the last time, I 
should like to hear your report as well.&quot;

Nervously, Gabrielle picked herself up and made rusty moves to the 
front. Her bravado was gone. She feared retribution for, what she felt, 
the poor work she did. Gabrielle had read the book; she just didn&#39;t 
comprehend it. She let Miss Madsen know quite plainly.

&quot;That&#39;s all right, as long as you did it. Your report, please.&quot; The 
redhead smiled shyly and turned towards the class.

&quot;First of all, I wanna thank all me friends for helpin&#39; me out. Ya 
didn&#39;t say we couldn&#39;t have help, so I asked Janine and Blake--or, well, 
they volunteered--to help, and that they did. I would&#39;ve been a mess 
without em&#39;.&quot; For their part, Blake and Janine tried not to look too 
proud. T&#39;was nothing.

Gabrielle then gave a desperate, skewed history of the first two 
chapters of Melville&#39;s great novel. She didn&#39;t lie about its difficulty 
or hers, she simply gave it as it was and left nothing for speculation. 
Sometimes the class laughed. Sometimes Gabrielle looked like she would 
give up. Her report, Madsen would notice later, had been written 
phonetically, which even then sometimes made it hard. Poor Gabrielle 
finally came to her conclusion, muttered about how no-good it was, and 
looked to her teacher for mercy. Hitomi took a long look at the redhead, 
her expression careful, before speaking.

&quot;Your report was enjoyable and refreshingly simple, but I did not like 
your attitude. You went from thankful to skulking, and I find that a 
poor choice of disposition. I cannot present to you anything higher than 
a C plus. Had you kept your optimism from yesterday, I would have 
awarded a very easy A. Do remember that for next time.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; whispered the poor Irish, looking ready to cry. Hitomi said 
nothing and let her be seated, then called the next: Janine Bautista.

&quot;Did you discover a new hobby that was unlike anything you&#39;ve done 
before?&quot; asked the teacher. Firmly, the black-haired girl nodded.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. When I helped Gabrielle, I did a bit of research on fishing 
and naval times. I also started to work on jigsaw puzzles, which I did 
not care for until now.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;d have been better off with those other two pursuits,&quot; 
murmured Madsen coldly, &quot;but you have begun something indeed. B minus. 
Miss Grissom, you need not stand in front of the class. I noticed you 
were here along with everyone else; however, can anyone tell me when 
exactly she arrived?&quot;

&quot;I can, ma&#39;am,&quot; said Olivia. She stood up and answered. &quot;Vicki and I 
pooled to school today since our assignment took us into the same house. 
Um, might I note that Victoria and I have been good friends for the past 
few years, and staying over at her house is a common thing for me?&quot; 
Hitomi smirked playfully, mentally chiding herself for the mistake, and 
laughed politely.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know that. I have to admit, I wouldn&#39;t have given you that 
assignment if I knew. Well, then I assume that you have completed your 
work as well, Miss Johnson?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. However, um... Vicki removed her pet spider from her room 
while we slept. I could not make myself sleep in that same room, in 
spite of our friendship.&quot;

&quot;I understand, and thank you for your honesty. An A for each of you.&quot; 
Olivia grinned triumphantly and sat down, sharing her smile with her 
friend.

After confirming that Blake Baum had both brought and taken her ADD 
medications, Madsen called on the next girl over, May Tramble. Neither 
shy nor outgoing, May went to the front of the class, cleared her 
throat, and read her homework.

&quot;&#39;Beautiful in Spite of Everything, by myself. I&#39;ve discovered through 
the course of writing this essay that I have indeed found myself cynical 
of many things, some of which make no sense, while others I find myself 
amazed at. I should look at things as blessings, but I don&#39;t. 
Unfortunately, I&#39;ve become too weathered down by the evil and the wrong 
that I observe to really find something that shines out--but there comes 
exception in the form of my younger twin sister, June, who very recently 
gained a little more independence.

&#39;I know that sometimes I can come across as pessimistic sometimes, but 
that&#39;s only because at times, I can find the world irritating or else 
lacking in optimism itself. I do not find everything bad or 
disagreeable; the matter of my younger sister, June, is something that 
brings me joy even amidst sorrow or oppression. These are not words from 
a bleeding heart, hopeless romantic, or anything close to a person who 
can love anyone unconditionally. June can irritate me and infuriate me, 
and at times I become impatient with her. She&#39;s physically unable to do 
a lot of things that I can do just fine, and there are times when I get 
so frustrated that I just don&#39;t want to help her at all. But the marks 
of a good person are when they help out those in need, oftentimes not 
ever expecting a reward. &quot;Blessed are they who shepherd the weak through 
the valley of darkness, for they are truly their brother&#39;s keeper&quot;, or 
in my case, my sister&#39;s.

&quot;&#39;Some years ago, an automobile accident took the use out of June&#39;s 
legs, and she has grown deeply dependent on me and my parents. I believe 
that this dependency, having to take care of another person, one whom I 
have already loved deeply from the start anyway, was the root for my 
optimism. You would think it strange, but I found myself happier as a 
servant, friend, and ever-present assistant to my sister than at any 
other time. No material possession could fulfill that sort of joy, and 
no great frustration and aggravation like that could spring from such 
unbelievable love. I have come at last to face the notion that there is 
not all good inside of me or anything else, but what good is there can 
outweigh what is not. That is my joy.&#39;&quot;

May took a deep breath and bowed to the applause. Hitomi Madsen did not 
clap, but she did smile and mark a proud A next to Tramble&#39;s name.

&quot;Well,&quot; sighed Madsen once May was seated, &quot;it seems we have come to a 
more entertaining part of the day. Miss Tran, Miss Blair, it would 
deeply disappoint me to learn that your assignments weren&#39;t done.&quot;

&quot;You can relax, lady,&quot; replied Furious Hail casually. &quot;We did it, all 
right. She came to the volunteer center and I made a friend, I guess. 
Maybe. I guess I oughta thank you; Ive&#39;s kinda grown on me.&quot;

&quot;Good, good. And you, Miss Tran?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Ivory was not stuck on words long. &quot;Yeah. Free food as long as 
you serve it up. I guess I learned and yada yada, all that crap.&quot; Madsen 
frowned. Even Gabrielle&#39;s sad report was cheerier.

&quot;Not a very good attitude, Miss Tran. Miss Blair, you&#39;ve earned an A, 
but I&#39;m afraid Miss Tran still has to learn some humility. You&#39;ve earned 
a C minus.&quot;

&quot;What?! I went to the fucking kitchen, okay?&quot;

&quot;And there goes that grade,&quot; sighed Madsen, crossing out the curved 
mark. Tran snorted violently, and Madsen, youthful and lithe Hitomi 
Madsen, glared right back. &quot;I would like to see an A plus next to your 
name by the end if this week, Miss Tran, but for that to happen, your 
attitude must improve. A bitter genius is worse than a hearty fool.&quot;

&quot;Damned proverbs--&quot;

&quot;You may fail this class before then, though,&quot; muttered Madsen coyly. 
Ivory snarled, but was calmed by Blake.

&quot;Hey, chill. It&#39;s not worth it. Just let it drop, okay?&quot;

&quot;Fuck you, retard.&quot;

&quot;Miss Tran.&quot; The class became glacial. Hitomi stood like a mountain, 
ready to crumble upon the shrub that was Ivory Tran. Within two words&#39; 
time, she had brought the entire room to a deadly, quiet still. Nobody 
dared speak.

&quot;Go easy on her, Miss Madsen,&quot; murmured Hail from the cold. &quot;She had a 
rough day. She told me all about it, didn&#39;t you? Something about being 
dumped and missing your bus, right? She forgot breakfast too. Don&#39;t be 
so hard on her.&quot;

Again, silence. Nobody dared do anything except stare, to see their 
teacher&#39;s reaction.

&quot;Miss Blair,&quot; sighed Madsen at last, &quot;for standing up for your new 
friend in spite of the reprimand you feared coming, I will give you 
thirty extra credit points. Miss Tran, you would do well to acquaint 
yourself better with Miss Blair. There is more good in her than even I 
reasoned.&quot; A few breaths sighed out, and the cold melted as things got 
back to normal. Ivory took a deep breath. Hail touched her shoulder.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t mind. I don&#39;t want you in trouble. I&#39;m sure you 
didn&#39;t mean it.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t,&quot; replied Tran, easing up at last, &quot;but only because you&#39;re 
right. My day was downright rotten. Thanks.&quot; Furious Hail smiled 
brightly, and leaned back as she watched everyone else present 
themselves and their fruits before the class. Hitomi Madsen gave her a 
soft, secret smile from across the room.

&quot;You would not believe trouble I went through for this paper,&quot; announced 
Mira van Dijk with a smile as she presented herself. &quot;I had to go on a 
small quest just for salad ingredients. I wrote everything down, and 
took it seriously. My friends would say that this assignment was not... 
me. I... put things off all the time.&quot;

&quot;And your report&#39;s done?&quot; asked Madsen. Mira nodded.

&quot;Yes. I took everything seriously. Listen, please, and forgive poor 
language. English is still hard for me.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all right. Japanese is hard for me, and my father was born 
there. Go on.&quot; (Madsen&#39;s Oriental heritage was plainly obvious, as she 
certainly looked like she had came from that area) Mira cleared her 
throat and began.

&quot;&#39;My assignment was to make a meatless salad, eat it, and report it. I 
found myself strangely attracted to this work, and I followed it to a 
degree which I had never reached before. What, could something so simple 
that it was almost an insult really provoke me like this? I had been 
stirred like pot from the last class, and I knew from the look in Miss 
Madsen&#39;s eye that she expected it to be serious. Plus, my grades were 
not good, and I want to make good impression when I... um...&#39; Permission 
to omit this part. Is very personal.&quot;

&quot;Does it have anything to do with your report?&quot;

&quot;No... I put it in by accident. Sometimes I tell secrets when I write 
enough.&quot;

&quot;All right. Go on, then, and I promise I won&#39;t look at it.&quot; Mira 
continued.

&quot;&#39;After school, I first went home and told my mother to make a salad for 
school. But it was my job, she said, and we had no salad ingredients 
anyway, not even dressing. I made note that this would add flavor, no 
pun, to my report, so I had to work for the money to buy the salad. 
Soon, my vader&#39;--erm, my father &#39;sent me to the store to shop, and let 
me have a bit of money for myself. He said that if I was buying food for 
salad, we must not waste it, and so I got a bit more than I needed. The 
grocery store was lonely and old Jules, a friend of my family, was the 
cashier.

&quot;&#39;I rode my bike to and from the store, and when I got home, I was 
surprised to find myself very eager for this task. My parents thought 
since I had went through all that trouble for food, I should be the one 
to make dinner, so I tried the best I could. I got a big bowl and put 
all the lettuce in, then I threw in cheese, very violent, and poured 
little biscuits...&#39; what are their names?&quot;

&quot;Croutons.&quot;

&quot;So sorry, I forgot the word. Um... &#39;into bowl. I don&#39;t watch cooking 
shows, but I like Iron Chef, so I pretended I was Iron Chef and put in 
all kinds of spices and little nuts. I like honey mustard dressing, so I 
put it into the salad and tried tossing it with fork, but father showed 
me how with the things that look like claws.&#39; Sorry, forgot word again.&quot;

&quot;Tongs.&quot;

&quot;Yes, thank you. I also forgot to write down the spices I put in, but I 
remember cinnamon and salt, and also I put in some vinegar with the 
dressing for my parents since they do not like honey mustard. I must now 
admit that eating my own creation was very fun, and perhaps I shall cook 
again, but tonight I will eat a big juicy steak!&#39;&quot; Mira laughed along 
with a few others, and light applause rewarded her great effort. Madsen 
looked as impressed with van Dijk as she had with Hail.

&quot;You&#39;ve amazed me, Miss van Dijk,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Writing a report is 
one thing, but you&#39;ve taken this thing to many new levels. This is 
exactly the type of work that will earn you A pluses! You&#39;ve earned one 
yourself, and also, except for one little thing I&#39;d like you to do, I 
don&#39;t think I need to give you any real homework tonight.&quot;

&quot;Ah! Thank you!&quot; Mira smiled broadly and bowed; some of the other 
students looked on in wonder, wishing they had gone to such great 
lengths. Gabrielle, finally out of her funk, just had to take a joke 
when it was before her.

&quot;Well now I&#39;m hungry.&quot;

Zane Klein had had a pathetic evening. She had tailor&#39;s block and 
couldn&#39;t make anything to wear for her next date--or at any other time, 
really--and she had gotten tough math problems from two teachers instead 
of just one. Madsen looked over them with disdain, and although the 
writing was bad and more than a few of the problems were incorrect, 
Aintzane had done the work. Not well, but well enough. She received a B 
minus, and mentally anticipated a bigger, more ferocious role for 
herself later. Thankfully, Madsen&#39;s sensible dress-suit inspired her to 
a degree.

X Walker&#39;s assignment sort of blended in with Mira&#39;s and May&#39;s, as she 
was asked to write. By far not one to pass up a chance to exercise 
creative muscles, X took the assignment with her usual tackle and came 
out, as always, barfing up philosophy. How she did ramble on when her 
fingers got to work; she mostly complained about how fat she seemed, and 
how she wanted a piercing for her navel. X also talked about how she 
thought girls with bandannas were sexy, and how radical it would be of 
her to shave her head and go utterly bald, and then went on the tangent 
of drama.

Walker poured her heart out and a few things else, but never got past 
the fifth page of her diatribe. Madsen politely and wisely stopped her, 
thanked her for the &quot;additional insight&quot;, and let her go with a solid B.

&quot;I think I know your assignment tonight, Miss Walker,&quot; she said. &quot;You 
should write another paper, but this time, do try and stay on one track. 
A derailed train causes disaster.&quot;

&quot;What,&quot; smiled X, &quot;you read proverbs every day?&quot;

&quot;A few. I usually just make them up, off the top of my head.&quot;

&quot;Cool.&quot; She let it be at that. Finally, poor miserable Lilian was 
next--last in line, and she feared, in love as well. Madsen gave her an 
extra credit point for being so patient, but Lilian was really trying 
just to hide. She hated going public about things, be they her dreams or 
bad drawings. And of course, Madsen had wanted them to merge into one 
assignment.

&quot;Frau Nachtheim, we&#39;re waiting.&quot; Lilian sighed, and forced herself out 
of her chair, a colored and folded paper in her hand. She mutely gave it 
to Madsen, trying desperately to hide it and herself. Hitomi unfolded it 
and gave it a brief glimpse. &quot;Is this what you saw in your vision?&quot;

&quot;Ja.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good. It&#39;s very good. But why do you look so embarrassed?&quot; Lilian 
tried to shy away, but it was impossible to do on her feet.

&quot;Just... I do not like my work. Nobody has liked my drawings before, and 
so I just stopped working on them. Nobody pays attention to it anyway, 
and I&#39;ve stopped caring too. Nobody has ever really cared about my 
dreams either, so I was really taken aback.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see,&quot; murmured Hitomi sadly. She gave her student an encouraging 
smile. &quot;Well, it&#39;s really very lovely work. You should not give up just 
because someone without any appreciation for art or work says it&#39;s 
worthless. Here--I&#39;ll be the first of what I know will be many 
admirers.&quot; Madsen then marked an A next to Lilian&#39;s name on her sheet, 
and hung the paper on the class bulletin board for all to see. Those 
nearest to it took a glimpse, and whistled.

&quot;That is good.&quot;

&quot;You drew this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really good.&quot;

&quot;I like it.&quot;

&quot;Looks like the world of Nippon.&quot; The class turned to X Walker, who 
grinned humbly. &quot;What? Hey, I&#39;ve got an imagination, too.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; sighed Miss Madsen once Lilian took her seat, &quot;for the most 
part, everyone did their jobs well. Many have room for improvement, but 
at this rate, you should all find yourselves excelling quickly. It seems 
we&#39;ve still got some time left, so I&#39;ll assign tonight&#39;s homework. 
Everyone except Miss van Dijk is to write a paper on the one material 
object they have come to love the most, and it&#39;s due first thing 
tomorrow. Miss Walker, for your additional homework, please write a 
story using seventy words or less.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, really?&quot; X grinned with happiness. Short stories came very easy 
to her--the slimmer, the better. And seventy words? She&#39;d have it done 
before lunch.

&quot;Don&#39;t underestimate this task,&quot; warned her teacher. &quot;You may find it 
very difficult with such a limitation. Also, I have an assignment for 
everyone else, but this will be turned in at the end of the week. I have 
assigned seats for everyone, and in the five minutes or so we have left, 
I&#39;ll call out your name and let you know where you&#39;ll be seated. Miss 
Blair, would you please sit next to Miss Tran? This will make your 
homework easier, I hope.

&quot;Miss Baum, I&#39;d like you to be seated next to Miss Klein. Miss Johnson, 
please join Miss van Dijk. Miss Tramble, please relocate yourself next 
to Miss Bautista. Miss Grissom, please go to Miss Walker. And Miss 
O&#39;Shannon, please be seated next to Miss Nachtheim.&quot; The girls did as 
they were told, shuffling and stumbling past each other until they got 
to their seats. The girls each shared one of the six double-desks in the 
room, two to a desk, though the awkwardness was evident. Madsen then 
assigned their task.

&quot;For the next week,&quot; she began, &quot;I would like for you to study whomever 
is sitting with you. I&#39;ve tried to fix you with somebody you don&#39;t know, 
and if I&#39;ve made a mistake, please tell me. You will receive three 
credit points for your honesty.&quot; Nobody said anything, so Madsen gave 
them the benefit of the doubt and trusted them. &quot;All right. By the end 
of the week, I&#39;d like a detailed report on your desk partner. List as 
much as you can about her. Get to know her. Befriend her. By the end of 
this year, I&#39;d like for everybody to know everybody inside and out. That 
seems to be the end of my work; now that we have some minutes left, feel 
free to begin your assignment early. I would like to wish you all a good 
day, with hopes of seeing you in the morning.&quot;

Madsen retired to a book, leaving the girls to acquaint.

Ivory Tran was weary by the time she got to lunch. Madsen&#39;s bundles of 
homework and her bitchy glare wore down on her like nobody else had, and 
that was just the first class. Torvald&#39;s assignments in French and 
German were killing her, and despite the eye candy she got in Abi 
Cerio&#39;s class, the tough math problems weren&#39;t worth it. Ivory was 
already weighed down by what seemed like a million things to do, and 
while she would get a rest during PE (in other words, Ancelin eye 
candy), she still felt like a slave--and on the second day, no less! 
Wearily she sat down, unaware of her surroundings.

Positioned around her, like Easter Island stone heads munching and 
talking, were the few girls that had enrolled in Ancelin&#39;s Kendo club, 
including the lovely Miss Yi herself. Ivory had to rub her face back to 
life and sigh before she could notice anyone with her, and when she did, 
her spirits rose tremendously. Ancelin looked even better up close, but 
she always seemed to have a natural beauty around her no matter what. 
She was taller and heavier than Ivory, with a Korean look to her face 
and a French build to her body. Her humble clothes seemed worn-out but 
very comfortable, and she carried herself with quietness and 
consideration, although few seemed to appreciate it.

Ivory had lusted over many women in her short &quot;life&quot; as a lesbian, but 
Ancelin might&#39;ve been the first where she felt genuine, actual love. 
Maybe. She&#39;d have to get closer to see.

&quot;Hey!&quot; she said, scooting closer to the small bunch. &quot;Remember me? We&#39;ve 
got the same gym and kendo class together. I introduced myself, right? 
Ivory Tran.&quot; Ancelin nodded politely and took the girl&#39;s hand. As Ivory 
expected, the palm and fingers were rough and strong.

&quot;Yeah. You called me Annie. Everyone else just calls me Ancelin or Yi.&quot;

&quot;What kind of a name is Ancelin, anyway?&quot; blurted Tran curiously. &quot;It&#39;s 
certainly not Anglo-Saxon, or Latin like mine.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s French,&quot; said the pretty brunette, taking her plain 
spaghetti in with great manners. &quot;It&#39;s half my heritage, actually; the 
other&#39;s Korean. It&#39;s a strange mix, but I&#39;ve lived with it. What about 
you?&quot;

&quot;Viet-Chinese,&quot; answered Ivory, &quot;but I was born in America. My parents 
came in during the sixties, I think. Ah, who cares? So you got a lotta 
homework? Man, I got a few bitches and witches for teachers! My English 
and math teachers are sexy as Hell, but one&#39;s a total control-bitch, 
like some army freak, and the other&#39;s so fucking smart I can barely 
understand her when she gets into numbers.&quot; Ancelin smiled, not too 
politely perhaps, and apologized.

&quot;Sorry. I don&#39;t mean to be rude by laughing at what sounds like your 
misery; you just put it all in a funny context. My classes are okay. 
I&#39;ve got a really sweet, kinda quirky woman for history, and of course 
we have the same gym teacher. My art teacher&#39;s really nice--uh, sorry.&quot; 
Ancelin blushed and smiled with embarrassment, realizing that she had 
been staring at Ivory the whole time. Ivory was unaware of it.

&quot;Sorry? For what? You the kinda girl who rambles a lot? Do people 
not...&quot; Not quite finishing her thought, Ivory looked around and 
noticed, for the most part, that Ancelin&#39;s table was clear. Not a whole 
lot of people assigned themselves next to the beauteous young woman. 
&quot;Let me guess,&quot; said Tran gently, &quot;you&#39;re the kind that doesn&#39;t get a 
whole lot of attention, but when you do, you kinda let out everything 
that&#39;s been stored away all at once?&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot;

&quot;Ho, boy, do I know how that feels. Well, actually, I kinda admit to 
being more outgoing.&quot;

&quot;Actually, that... never mind.&quot; Ancelin shrugged and drank whatever 
remained in her glass. There was silence between the two girls for a 
period, then Tran went in for the kill.

&quot;So tell me something about you. I wanna know something. You seem like 
an all right bird, and you&#39;re about as strong as you are beautiful.&quot;

That made Ancelin blush.

&quot;Thank you. I suppose if I wanted to, I could be prettier or stronger. 
I&#39;m stuck between feministic loveliness and tomboyish physicality. I&#39;m 
the best, or worst, of both worlds, stuck somewhere and--well what do 
you know?&quot; Ancelin grinned shyly, mostly at herself, and concluded with 
a wry, &quot;I do spill everything when I have an audience.&quot;

&quot;Told ya,&quot; said Ivory coolly. &quot;I&#39;m really good at reading people, 
especially women. I guess you could say... I know my own gender inside 
and out.&quot; Ancelin nodded, unable to catch the deep sexual meaning that 
Ivory had aimed for. All the better, perhaps--she&#39;d be too red to handle 
if she had.

&quot;Well...there&#39;s really more to me than what you see.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s why I wanna know more about you,&quot; countered Tran softly, 
almost seductively. Ancelin swallowed. Unlike the more lecherous Ivory, 
she had not been very experienced in the matters of love or lust, and 
knew little outside the tenderness of her own family. Yi was 
unfortunately inexperienced, which gave Ivory all the more reason to 
pursue her. The dilemma was deciding which type was more fun: beginner 
or expert. She had been with both and loved it all, but Ancelin...

Ivory couldn&#39;t remember the last time a woman really gave her shivers.

&quot;Fries?&quot; she asked, offering her leftover lunch. Ancelin passed it down.

&quot;I don&#39;t eat French fries. And don&#39;t mention my heritage; it has nothing 
to do with it. It&#39;s just from a movie I saw.&quot;

&quot;Which one?&quot;

&quot;Supersize Me.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, I heard it was pretty good.&quot;

&quot;It is, but it really opened my eyes.&quot; Ancelin stirred at her soup 
absently as she spoke, anything to get away from the penetrating vision 
of Ivory&#39;s brown-and-blue stare. Girls with two different eye colors 
(usually those forgetting a contact lens) made her insides feel like a 
geyser. &quot;There&#39;s this part in the DVD extras that really got my mind 
going,&quot; she resumed. &quot;Did you see that?&quot;

&quot;Nah, I just saw it in theaters. What was it about?&quot; Ivory leaned 
forward, putting her tight clothes, liberal exposure of skin, and 
sensual aura all the closer. Ancelin felt her throat tighten as a breeze 
of perfume and breath touched her.

&quot;The guy, you know--I forgot his name--the guy doing the experiment put 
a lot of McDonald&#39;s food in jars, including their fries, then he put a 
burger and fries from a restaurant--a mom and pop restaurant--in jars as 
well. After a few months, what do you think happened to all that food?&quot;

&quot;Uh, it turned into magical deposits of penicillin and brew?&quot;

&quot;Right, fungus city. But get this--the McDonald&#39;s fries never rotted, 
not once. They stayed as fresh as the day they were made. Now what do 
you think something like that does to your digestion system?&quot; Ivory made 
a disgusted face and pushed her tray off to the distant side. Simply 
hearing it from Ancelin made her sick.

&quot;Ew. I see your point.&quot;

&quot;Tis&#39; a disgust!&quot; shouted a voice from across the cafeteria. Ancelin 
craned her head around, and saw an impish blonde with long pigtails 
chatting with a handsome, mannish-looking woman.

&quot;They seem to agree with us,&quot; she pointed. Ivory nodded.

&quot;So are you a health nut, or do you just not like fries?&quot;

&quot;I try to eat healthily. Lately I&#39;ve been going on a Jewish diet. Did 
you know that in the old days, the Hebrews couldn&#39;t eat most red meats?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but they could eat crickets and locusts. Yuck!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve had crickets and locusts,&quot; shrugged Ancelin. &quot;They&#39;re not so bad 
if you fry them. Anyway, I&#39;ve been frying and grilling less and baking 
and boiling more. Soups, salads, pastas, lots of poultry and fish... I 
never eat anything smarter than a parrot.&quot; Ivory stuck her tongue out.

&quot;You&#39;ve eaten parrot?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m just saying. Parrots are smart, but things like dolphins, apes, 
monkeys, and pigs are smarter. I just use parrots as a base.&quot;

&quot;Pigs are smart?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I heard,&quot; shrugged Yi. &quot;I read that pigs can be trained and 
domesticated just like monkeys. I even heard of a pig who saved a kid&#39;s 
life.&quot;

&quot;Wow.&quot; Ivory sat there amazed--not just at the little facts being thrown 
around, but by how much Ancelin knew, how deep she was. Clearly, this 
was not just a big piece of yummy for the eyes, but a person strong 
enough to match wits or power with anyone else. She was liking &quot;Annie&quot; 
more and more, and luckily for Ivory, the feelings were being exchanged 
as well. Perhaps as long as Ancelin had an audience, she would like that 
person, but Ivory had personalities and traits that she did not, she 
could not have.

&quot;There&#39;s more to you than I thought,&quot; admitted the Oriental girl with a 
smile. &quot;Say, I&#39;m not gonna be too busy after I get all my homework 
tonight. You wanna go somewhere, hang out, see a movie, get acquainted?&quot;

&quot;Like a date?&quot; whispered Ancelin unsteadily. Ivory gave off her most 
charming, roguish smile.

&quot;Well, if ya want. I mean, if girls are your thing. I just wanna find 
out a lot about Annie Yi, so maybe I can be her company when she&#39;s 
feeling all alone.&quot; Ancelin&#39;s small band of friends, long gone by this 
point, had not stayed around to hear the little insult to their 
companionship; Ancelin didn&#39;t take it hard anyway.

&quot;I&#39;d... like that a lot, Ivory.&quot;

Ivory. Ivory. Her name sounded so much more musical when it came from 
Ancelin&#39;s mouth. Ivory shivered again. She had it bad and barely knew 
the poor thing.

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Their pulses both throbbed heavily, as if nerved by each 
other&#39;s company. It was good, lustful anticipation, the kind met by 
inexperienced lovers on their very first night alone, tempted by cool 
breezes and moons, and the gentle songs of crickets and radios turned 
very low. Ivory hadn&#39;t felt giddy in ages, Ancelin hadn&#39;t felt it at 
all.

And of course, as it always seems to happen during the time of greatest 
pressure and suspense, their moment was interrupted.

&quot;Hey, everybody! FOOD FIGHT!!!&quot;

Ancelin and Ivory ducked on instinct as food flew their way. All kinds 
of things rained over and onto their heads--including French fries right 
at Ancelin&#39;s direction. The predictably ironic act infuriated the 
French-Korean to a degree unseen by most people, and before the fight 
could turn into a hurricane, Ancelin bolted out of her chair and 
screamed &quot;STOP!!&quot; Unfortunately, a wad of mashed potatoes had been in 
the air at the time, and it struck poor Ancelin right in the chest. She 
scowled, wiped it off, and stalked after the culprit. Ivory watched in 
awe as her object of infatuation towered over the meek blonde and the 
embarrassed bluenette who had started it all.

&quot;Uh, hi,&quot; squeaked the blonde, who resembled a Chinese Sailor Moon. 
Ancelin&#39;s glacial eyes dug into her like dynamite.

&quot;Would you kindly explain to me what compelled you to start a food fight 
in the middle of a cafeteria on the second day of school, miss...&quot;

&quot;Uh, Ana Lu.&quot;

&quot;Tell me, miss Lu,&quot; she scowled. Ana swallowed in fear; her mannish 
companion merely rolled her eyes.

&quot;Uh...&quot;

&quot;Or better yet, I&#39;ll tell you. Still stuck in middle school, are we? You 
know, I don&#39;t believe all that nonsense about hair color affecting one&#39;s 
behavior, but I&#39;m tempted to believe that you, miss Lu, had a blonde 
moment. Maybe you&#39;ve never really felt pain or experienced loneliness 
before, and you&#39;ve always had your friends or a boyfriend around to keep 
you happy. Your happiness has never felt any obstacles, has it? You&#39;re 
not the kind to take anything seriously, are you? And just so that I 
haven&#39;t missed anything, you&#39;re probably not the kind who&#39;s ever starved 
before, or been abused, or have been forced to go homeless. Are you?&quot;

&quot;Take it easy on her, she&#39;s just a kid,&quot; said the bluenette softly, 
trying to placate Ancelin. The tall woman&#39;s fury was too hot for a 
little shiver of cold to chill it down.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I quite saw you trying to stop your friend, so you may be 
just as guilty as her. Lu, what&#39;s her name?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Rai Zan--&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask you,&quot; spat Ancelin evilly. &quot;I asked Lulu here. Now, Lu, 
what&#39;s her name?&quot; Ana swallowed nervously.

&quot;Rai Zanders.&quot;

&quot;Rai Zanders and Ana Lu. All right. Now, girls... I want you to remember 
what I&#39;ve said. Hardships mature a person, and it looks as if neither of 
you--well, Lulu anyway--have had many. I have. I&#39;m currently mad at you, 
both of you, for this disregard of food and the health it could&#39;ve 
brought to you. I&#39;ve known the sting of starvation before, and to see 
this mindless waste really ticked me off. But I&#39;m in a very, very good 
mood today, so I&#39;ll forgive you and let you off if you do me a big 
favor.&quot;

&quot;Wh-what is it?&quot; Ancelin darkly stared at the blonde, placing her hands 
on the table as an emphasis.

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to turn yourselves in, or admit to doing this. I don&#39;t 
even want you to clean this up. If you decide to throw food away, that&#39;s 
your decision. I just want you both to try and imagine what it&#39;d be like 
to go without eating for a few days. Abstain from taking in nourishment, 
if you can, then come back and try to reason why you felt it would be 
better to waste it than compliment the bodily temples your souls 
inhabit. My own soul is weary, but I have tried to keep its shelter pure 
by taking in food which would bring me health and energy. I cannot say 
anything so good about my mental health, except that I&#39;m trying. I&#39;m 
trying awful hard. And things like this really tick me off. So... Lulu. 
Zanders. Don&#39;t forget. Here.&quot;

Ancelin Yi handed them five dollars each, and told them to buy back the 
lunches they had wasted. Of course, by that time, the whole cafeteria 
had turned to stare at the spectacle, including many teachers. It looked 
as if they wouldn&#39;t be needed, so many sat down. Only the headmistress, 
Ms. Marbel, kept watch over the scene to see what would come of it all.

&quot;Now,&quot; whispered Ancelin seriously, &quot;get to class. From now on, I 
suggest you both exercise wisdom whenever you decide to do something. 
There&#39;s nothing entertaining in making such rash actions.&quot; Ana Lu and 
Rai Zanders, one looking more pathetic than the other, quietly left the 
lunchroom together. Ancelin sighed and rubbed her forehead, groaning in 
misery at the mess on her shirt. Ivory joined her as soon as the shock 
wore off.

&quot;That was cool,&quot; she whispered. Ancelin smiled wearily, then noticed 
that she had drawn an audience.

&quot;I think we should leave.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, good idea.&quot; Ivory helped her new friend clean up, and together 
they left in the opposite direction of Ana and Rai. Ivory Tran hummed 
&quot;Surf Rider&quot; the whole way.</pre>
