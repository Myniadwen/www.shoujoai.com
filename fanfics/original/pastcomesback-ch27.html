<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 27 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>      &quot;She... she&#39;s not going to bite me or anything, right?&quot; Seth asked and Bakra shrugged.

      &quot;Probably not. I mean - she seems like the type who only goes for girls but if she&#39;s 
really desperate...&quot; The demon paused. &quot;If she does, I&#39;ll yank her off of you.&quot;

      How the young man got stuck giving the unconscious Carmilla a piggy back ride was 
beyond him. They were currently inside the labyrinth, waiting. Erin had dispersed her golem 
into smaller snakes to find the correct way to go so they didn&#39;t get lost.

      Sakura was rubbing her arms, worried. &quot;I felt a spark of energy earlier... I hope 
everyone&#39;s okay.&quot;

      Tycara bit her lip and clung to Seth. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m worried. The dark power wasn&#39;t from 
Isaka and no one else has come back...&quot;

      Erin suddenly let out a sigh. &quot;Alright, Posh-Posh is going to lead us there now that 
the golem found someone,&quot; she said, turning to everyone else. &quot;But there&#39;s only one person 
there... injured I think.&quot;

      &quot;You think?&quot; Abby asked and everyone exchanged looks before Eveon raised her hand.

      &quot;By think, you mean possibly dead?&quot;

      Without hesitation, the fastest of the group, Bakra and Sakura sped/flew down the 
correct path, following the snake. The demon muttered curses under his breath. It was a 
stupid idea to let Isaka and Tsuru go alone, but... who could be the one person left? What 
happened to the others?

      He had a bad feeling as he followed the jingling snake, especially since the three 
sisters most likely already left. What if...

      Sakura was frowning down at him. &quot;Was the Demon Lord summoned?&quot;

      &quot;I dunno. I figured we&#39;d feel it reverberate throughout the castle, but Tycara felt 
some unrecognizable energy... We might be too late.&quot;

      With that, the pair found themselves in the dark room. Sakura swooped down to the body 
and Bakra ran over, taking off his black jacket. Sakura grimaced.

      Isaka was out cold, burns and lacerations on her body. There was only a little bit of 
blood, but as Bakra put his jacket around her, he recognized her wounds immediately. &quot;She 
was taken out by a strong holy power... probably an exorcist art.&quot;

      As Sakura set about healing her, only one word crossed her lips. &quot;Krystal...?&quot;

      Bakra let out a sigh. &quot;If her girlfriend did become the Demon Lord... would she have 
been able to do this? Or...&quot; He looked around and got up.

      There were definitely signs of a ritual and... two discarded swords lied in a dark 
corner. Tsuru would have never left behind the swords of her fallen comrades - that was her 
life. Without her need to one-up Isaka or protect others, she had no reason to live. Those 
weapons were everything to her.

      He came back over to Sakura as everyone else started filing into the room. Posh-Posh 
jumped energetically and Bakra looked at him. &quot;I understand, little man. It&#39;s all a bit too 
weird.&quot; 

***** 

      Krystal wanted to be back home, back in Isaka&#39;s arms, and wake up thinking it was all 
a dream. There were a pair of warm arms around her, holding her affectionately and breaths 
barely ticking her ear. Krystal allowed her eyes to open slightly to a dimly lit room. With 
sheer dread, Krystal realized that her apartment wasn&#39;t lit with candles on the wall, barely 
shining.

      She didn&#39;t dare move, but the woman behind her already knew she was awake. Black hair 
spilled over her shoulder as the arm around her waist moved to support the woman. Tsuru 
looked down at her, before lowering herself to plant sweet kisses on Krystal&#39;s neck.

      The blonde girl stared straight ahead, wishing this wasn&#39;t true. &quot;Good morning,&quot; Tsuru 
whispered.

      &quot;Why are you doing this to me?&quot;

      Tsuru stopped and took a moment to answer. &quot;I love you, Krystal.&quot;

      Krystal swallowed, still staring at the wall. &quot;But I love Isaka.&quot;

      &quot;I know, but she&#39;s not good for you-&quot;

      &quot;If this is your way of getting revenge, it&#39;s not right.&quot; Krystal turned over to look 
at Tsuru, who was now sitting up. &quot;If you&#39;re trying to get back at Isaka, shouldn&#39;t you be 
settling it in a different way?&quot;

      Tsuru just frowned. &quot;This... isn&#39;t about her, or revenge. This is about you. It 
doesn&#39;t matter that it&#39;s her - I would have taken you away from anyone that didn&#39;t deserve 
you.&quot; She let one hand caress Krystal&#39;s cheek. &quot;I love you very much so I&#39;m not going to let 
you ruin yourself at the hands of someone else - especially her.&quot;

      Krystal pushed the hand away. &quot;I love her. I&#39;m sorry Tsuru.&quot;

      The new Lord of Demons ran a hand through her dark hair. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll have 
plenty of time.&quot; She turned towards Krystal, who sat up as well.

      &quot;Tsuru... you need to get rid of that power you have. It&#39;s evil,&quot; she murmured, but 
Tsuru only laughed.

      &quot;Evil? It&#39;s only evil if you allow it to be. It feels...&quot; Tsuru looked down at her own 
hands. &quot;It feels nice knowing that you have something so strong behind you.&quot; She faced 
Krystal and placed her hands on her shoulders. &quot;And I want to share that power with you.&quot;

      &quot;What...?&quot; Krystal tried to move away, but only found her back against the headboard. 
&quot;I don&#39;t want to share any of it with you.&quot;

      Tsuru&#39;s expression softened. &quot;But you will... once you taste it and feel it, you&#39;ll 
want it... and you&#39;ll want me too.&quot;

      Krystal turned her face to the side as Tsuru leaned in for a kiss. The blonde 
instantly began to summon her holy power, with the intent of stunning her possessed friend. 
As Tsuru&#39;s lips found her cheek, Krystal realized her holy power wasn&#39;t manifesting.

      The blonde took a deep breath, eyes wide. Her holy power was gone. She shoved away 
Tsuru before frantically asking, &quot;What did you do to me?&quot;

      Tsuru gave her a small smile. &quot;I guess you noticed. I... ate all of your holy energy 
earlier. Don&#39;t worry - it will build up again to its normal level in a few days. I did it so 
you couldn&#39;t pull any tricks on me.&quot;

      Krystal stared at her, still shocked. &quot;You... you ate it?&quot; What else could the Demon 
Lord do?

      She was still too surprised to turn away this time when Tsuru leaned in to kiss her. 
Krystal froze up as she felt that same coldness from before. It was almost like staring at a 
deep crevasse of darkness. It was unknown, yet something about it drew her in, wanting her 
to jump into the shadows and... and...

      Krystal suddenly realized what was happening as the coldness seeped deeper into her 
chest. She pulled away and looked off to the side as she caught her breath. The candles were 
still flickering against the wall.

      &quot;It&#39;s tempting, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

      She ignored Tsuru&#39;s comment as tears slid down her cheeks. She hated herself for what 
she just did. She&#39;d almost given in to the darkness and love Tsuru offered.

      The Lord of Demons kissed away her tears and smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t be so stubborn... I don&#39;t 
want to force you into anything, so take your time.&quot;

      Krystal turned back to face her. &quot;If you loved me, then you would take me back to 
Isaka.&quot;

      Tsuru&#39;s smile grew as she leaned in closer. &quot;That would have worked on the old me, but 
this is for your own good Krystal.&quot;

      She was expecting another kiss, but Tsuru dropped to her neck. Krystal realized what 
was happening a little too late as fangs sunk into her delicate skin, the blood that escaped 
Tsuru&#39;s greedy mouth staining her white dress.

      The room became darker as Tsuru drank more. By the time she pulled away, Krystal felt 
like she was floating in the bed. &quot;You&#39;re very delicious,&quot; the ebony haired woman said, 
easing Krystal under the covers.

      She gave the blonde a quick peck on the lips before tucking her in. She fell asleep by 
the time Tsuru left the room.

      Hoshi was standing outside a confident smile on her face. &quot;You left a lot earlier than 
I expected.&quot;

      Tsuru shrugged and shut the door. &quot;She needs time to accept it. I don&#39;t want to rush 
her.&quot;

      &quot;Why not? If you were to take her now, she would have no choice-&quot;

      &quot;Hoshi.&quot; Tsuru&#39;s tone was sharp and quick.

      The silver haired woman bowed. &quot;I apologize, master. I stepped beyond my boundaries-&quot;

      Before she could finish talking, Hina came running down the hallway, her hands 
slightly stained with blood. &quot;Big sister! Master!&quot; The little fell to her knees in front of 
Tsuru, earning a scowl from Hoshi.

      &quot;Please!&quot; The blonde girl said, bowing so low to the ground that her forehead touched. 
&quot;Tsuki&#39;s hurt really bad - please save her! She got hurt because of me so I will take any 
punishment for it, but please help her.&quot;

      Tsuru stared at the little girl before heading down the hallway. Hina was pulled up to 
her feet by her big sister, who followed as well. Tsuru came to a stop at a bedroom where 
Tsuki was lying on her stomach on the bed with only her panties on.

      Hina had attempted to use first aid on the semi-conscious girl. Different salves were 
spread about as well as bloody gauze and bandages. Hina&#39;s juvenile aid did little to help 
her older sister. The blonde girl was now wiping at her tears as Hoshi&#39;s scowl disappeared 
at the dire sight of her sister.

      Tsuru placed her hand on Tsuki&#39;s back, causing the brunette to let out a hiss of pain. 
Her hand began to light up with holy energy as she set about healing the younger girl&#39;s 
wounds. Tsuki let out a low moan as the deep cuts and burns started to seam together. After 
a few minutes, Tsuru started to bandage up the wounds.

      &quot;I will come back tomorrow to do more, but your sister needs more rest,&quot; Tsuru said.

      Hina bowed deeply. &quot;Thank you so much, master! I eternally belong to you and I will 
offer you anything as thanks and-&quot; Her ranting was stopped as Tsuru placed a hand on her 
head.

      &quot;I would never allow any of my servants to die under my care,&quot; Tsuru whispered to her.

      Hina&#39;s face lit up and she went back over to Tsuki&#39;s side, sitting on a chair. Tsuru 
started to leave the room and looked over at Hoshi.

      &quot;I want you to punish them both for failing me,&quot; she whispered to the silver haired 
woman. &quot;You&#39;re allowed to do anything you think is appropriate, though don&#39;t hurt Tsuki 
anymore than she already is. I&#39;m sure her watching Hina taking her portion of punishment 
will suffice.&quot;

      Hoshi allowed a smile to creep back on her face. &quot;Of course, master. I will carry out 
your orders with much... pleasure...&quot;

      As Tsuru walked out, Hoshi closed the door behind her, malevolently watching the scene 
in front of her. Hina was whispering sweet things to Tsuki, the brunette smiling happily at 
her sister&#39;s care for her. 

***** 

      Eveon flipped through the magazine, not really paying attention to it. It was 
something her mommy gave her so she wouldn&#39;t be bored since Mina was... she wasn&#39;t sure what 
Mina was doing, actually. Maybe she was helping Seth with research? That was probably it - 
she most likely tagged along with him to get books about the Demon Lord or whatever.

      She looked over at the bed to see that the vampire was still fast asleep. Carmilla was 
out like a light thanks to the way she was abused by the crazy sisters from Japan or 
wherever they were originally from. Eveon flipped another page in the magazine. And now... 
Tsuru and Krystal were gone, Isaka was out cold and the Lord of Demons was running about... 
goodness.

      It was at that point that Carmilla started to stir, her blood red eyes opening and her 
silver hair spilled all over the pillow. Eveon closed the magazine as the woman sat up. 
&quot;You&#39;re awake? Awesome, I&#39;ll go tell everyone else.&quot;

      As she got up, Carmilla grabbed her wrist. It was then that Eveon realized being put 
in a room by herself with a vampire was not the smartest thing her mommy had done.
