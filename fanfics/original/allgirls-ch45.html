<h1>All Girls School (part 45 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch44.html">Back to Part 44</a><pre>Bernadette Marbel puckered her lips as she put the last touches of 
lipstick on them. She took a breath, smoothed out her dress, and teased 
her graying hair. She took another breath. She adjusted her necklace for 
the third time, dusted the hairs off her dress, and washed her hands 
again. At last, she put a dabble of perfume on, and made sure everything 
was in place. Her lover and wife came in, adjusting her earrings, and 
made a polite smile.

&quot;Oh, you look nice. If I didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d say you weren&#39;t 
even a middle-aged woman, let alone the Headmistress of a School.&quot;

&quot;So I don&#39;t look terrible.&quot;

&quot;Not to my eyes,&quot; she said. Joanna kissed her wife&#39;s shoulder and hugged 
her from behind, regarding &quot;Marvelous.&quot; Bernadette smiled weakly.

&quot;I feel much older than my fifty-some years. I&#39;m getting fat and gray.&quot;

&quot;More for me to kiss,&quot; argued her wife. &quot;And I did always like the color 
silver.&quot; Marbel grinned, turned around, and became even more serious 
than she usually was. She held her wife&#39;s arms and pressed their 
foreheads together.

&quot;Maybe this is the year I finally tell them about you,&quot; she whispered. 
Joanna shrugged.

&quot;Maybe. You&#39;ve put it off forever and ever.&quot;

&quot;I just... wish I knew whether or not we&#39;d be accepted. If the 
Superintendent found out&#151;&quot;

&quot;Which I&#39;m sure he will anyway.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll do,&quot; sighed Marbel. Joanna kissed her nose, and 
touched her face gently. Her wife continued with, &quot;It&#39;s not as if I&#39;m 
embarrassed or ashamed, it&#39;s just... my job. I have to keep that job.&quot;

&quot;I know you do. And I have to keep mine.&quot;

&quot;Do you think...&quot; Marbel&#39;s eyes crossed with her lover&#39;s. &quot;...Society 
has evolved enough to accept the fact that two women in their early 
fifties are married and in love? It&#39;s always a sketchy topic, I know, 
but&#151;&quot;

&quot;Will the other teachers support you?&quot; she asked. Marbel shook her head.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. So few of them are really, honestly like 
us&#151;the few that I know of, anyway. Those that are, I know wouldn&#39;t care. 
They&#39;d have a field day regardless.&quot; Her beautiful Harmony nodded her 
head.

&quot;I do so want to come with you. I&#39;ve been aching to... for years... and 
I&#39;ve always understood how my presence would jeopardize our jobs. The 
way you say things, now would be the worst possible time for us to lose 
them. But all times are. Those girls need you, Sapphire.&quot;

&quot;And everyone else needs you, Harmony.&quot; They kissed, and kissed again, 
and stood in silence. Marbel felt her lover&#39;s touch across her naked 
hand and smiled. &quot;I really want you to come with me, love. I really do, 
and damn those who disapprove.&quot;

&quot;Ah, the old firebrand awakes. See, old age has made us careful&#151;and we 
were so brash in our youth! I think in time, we may yet afford to be 
silly again with ourselves.&quot; Joanna kissed her lover&#39;s hands many times, 
and even though it was mere hours before the opening festivities of 
Homecoming, Bernadette Marbel moaned in pleasure and undressed herself 
before her wife.

&quot;Homecoming Blues&quot;

The time, Friday evening at seven, all the way to eleven that night; the 
place, Stanton&#39;s large soccer field; the cost, $15 for advance tickets 
and $20 at the door; as to who could come, it was everyone, students and 
teachers alike, plus their dates; the event, Homecoming, a celebration 
of the school&#39;s basketball season and triumphs, although it did not end 
up taking the championship title. It was going to be a great night 
regardless for everyone, just so long as they behaved themselves.

Avelina and Ethan searched for Vai, but they didn&#39;t see her in the 
crowds, nor did they see Kula, whom Avelina had also befriended. Rai 
Zanders came with arms crossed and expectations low; Ana Lu had stayed 
home due to still feeling upset over the break-up. Dr. Andrews stood 
watching the festivities inside the medical tent, her date temporarily 
absent since she had volunteered to greet guests. Bernadette Marbel was 
at the very front, welcoming people and helping with ticket sales, and 
her wife Joanna Langston was there with her, looking shy if not anxious.

&quot;No turning back now,&quot; said Erica to Jocelyn as she helped her friend 
around. Joss was not quite showing yet, but she could feel her baby 
growing larger and stronger; soon she&#39;d be in emotional hell. As for 
Erica&#39;s sister, she had come to the event solo, and decided to stay solo 
unless some lonely woman came up to her. Ancelin and Ivory came as 
dates, although they still were not officially a couple yet (because 
Ancelin was still cautious about Ivory&#39;s reputation); Farrah was there 
with Tristan, and frankly not enjoying herself since she feared her 
friend was going to make a fool of herself.

When she had some free time, Joanna walked over to her wife and 
discreetly nudged her in the ribs. Hitomi and Abby Keeping were clearly 
acting as more than friends and coworkers; Abi Cerio looked like she 
didn&#39;t care if people saw her flirting with Dr. Andrews; Sarah Jo and Em 
McGowen were holding hands, and even Samantha O&#39;Brien had brought a 
female companion. Marbel saw it all and raised her brow.

&quot;My... I didn&#39;t realize there were so many gay women in my school.&quot;

Nomi knew that she and Amina had to stick together, because many people 
had warned them of how poorly first-year students were treated during 
Stanton&#39;s Homecoming festivities. Oh of course, nobody was hurt, but 
humiliation was often more hard to bear than actual physical pain, and 
it was usually the first-year girls who fell victim the most. Even if 
the two hadn&#39;t decided to stay together&#151;as dates, as friends, as 
support, who knows&#151;they were soon bunched together in four large groups, 
each one containing the members of the four classes of Stanton. Nomi and 
Amina found themselves looking pale as they scanned over the small size 
of the first-year class.

Kathlyn Parkin hung back with a few of the teachers, content to watch 
unless certain activities enabled her to participate. Thanks to the 
efforts of Leena and Sarah Jo, she was becoming a healthy young woman 
again, although she could still lose her breath and lag behind. Her 
romantic life was in worse shape, though: after her failure with X 
Walker, Kathlyn had gravitated towards Ancelin, whom she had a sizeable 
crush on. Their romance lasted quite awhile, considering the younger 
girl was still contemplating Ivory&#39;s place in her world. Ancelin was 
just what Kathlyn was looking for in a woman; however, she was 
eventually released to find someone else.

As Ancelin put it, &quot;I know what you&#39;re going through, Katt, and I agree 
that a person like me would be ideal to help you, but frankly, I think 
you need to look for... maybe... an older woman, one who&#39;s had even more 
experience than you, to help you along. It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like you, 
I just think... I&#39;m not what you&#39;re looking for.&quot; Ancelin had kissed her 
and sent her on her way, and now here she was, alone and not enjoying 
the Homecoming, despite being in the senior class. At least Leena was 
there, and never too busy to be with her.

Leena. Another person she had a wild crush on. And she was older, too. 
It was something to consider.

Alisha Fox was now dating Ancelin, though it wouldn&#39;t last (and poor 
Ivory was kept &quot;on hold&quot;!). She was actually more concerned about her 
younger sister, who seemed to have grown awfully close to Jocelyn since 
her boyfriend passed on. Sure, the girl was emotional because of her 
pregnancy and the big loss, and Erica had been her best friend since 
grade school, but something didn&#39;t seem right about their relationship, 
nor hers with Ancelin. The tall girl with enviable buckeye hair was 
staring off into the distance, watching Ivory clown around with Farrah.

&quot;Yo, Ants, you awake?&quot; Alisha rapped Ancelin&#39;s shoulder, grabbing her 
attention briefly. &quot;Look, uh, we&#39;re in separate classes, and you&#39;re with 
my sister, so uh... go easy on her when these games start flying, will 
you?&quot;

&quot;Go easy? Oh. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll play those rough games. I like the 
ones where everyone has a good time and doesn&#39;t care about winning.&quot;

&quot;Uh, then you&#39;re in the wrong place,&quot; she murmured quietly. She managed 
a careful smile and sat back as the Headmistress called everyone&#39;s 
attention and began to speak.

&quot;Good evening, and thank you for attending this year&#39;s Homecoming event. 
Let me first explain this evening&#39;s schedule for the newcomers. Most 
Homecomings, you know, involve dances, but since this school does not 
admit male students, it was decided that such a social gathering would 
be very hard, if not impossible.&quot; (Would anyone have believed the number 
of rolled eyes there? Even Joanna chuckled) &quot;Therefore, we have instead 
opted for a more casual get-together, and it&#39;s been passed around the 
board to promote theme years for each Homecoming. Last year&#39;s successful 
Luau is just one example.&quot;

Several people nudged Kula, which only served to aggravate her. Marbel 
continued.

&quot;As you know, this year is American Western-themed, and our activities 
shall reflect as such. We will have a concert at the end, plus 
refreshments, but first you&#39;ll notice that you&#39;ve been divided up into 
four groups according to your class and age, so this first activity will 
be held in each of your groups. Your sponsors will give you details 
about the games, but we&#39;ll get into that later. Let me first go over a 
few ground rules.&quot; A few people groaned, but Marbel&#39;s voice won them 
over. &quot;Your sponsors are there to ensure your safety, so these rules 
must be obeyed.

&quot;First, there will be no fighting, no poor sportsmanship, no cheating, 
et cetera. Second, I will not condone violent language or excessive 
aggression. There have been enough fiascos in previous years due to 
several first-year students being humiliated, so I also do not want 
anyone taking this very far. No drugs and alcohol, of course, and 
please, please, if you must create a mess, do remember to clean it up. 
We&#39;re not animals and we&#39;re not children, so we must behave as such. 
Failure to follow these rules will result in punishment too severe to 
speak of out loud.&quot;

The crowd murmured and whistled grimly. Marbel smiled, said &quot;Have a good 
time and be safe&quot; grimly, and left the day to the sponsors, three 
volunteer teachers per class. First-year students had Raulson, Torvald, 
and Keys; sophomores had Madsen, O&#39;Brien, and Post; juniors, Keeping, 
Andrews, and McGowen; seniors, Cerio, Johansson, and Katajisto.

&quot;Well,&quot; said Nomi to Amina, &quot;guess we better get started.&quot;

The games started out stupid: races, improv, use the prop, things like 
that. Competition already started to break out, even amongst teammates, 
and some forgot that the people they were &quot;fighting&quot; would soon be the 
ones they would have to rely on. Sponsors soon called the girls together 
and told them of the three main events, ones where class would compete 
against class. The first activity was find the flag; the second, a dance 
contest between the four groups; the third involved a rather large 
quick-draw contest where everyone would be given a water gun and told 
that, like in many good Westerns, whoever had the fastest hand (and the 
driest clothes) would win. As an added incentive to squirt first, the 
losing class would be bombarded with water balloons. The winners would 
be treated to an ice cream trough.

The soccer field was broken into four parts for the first group 
activity, and each student had an idea or strategy to win the game. A 
few teachers were chosen to be group leaders&#151;McGowen, Torvald, Madsen, 
and Leena led their individual classes&#151;and the students were divided up 
according to their skill. Some were sprinters, people chosen to rush in 
and take their opponents into the jails, or to break their allies out. 
Others were hunters, people chosen to search for the flag. A few were 
guards, picked to keep watch over the flag, and those remaining were 
seekers, who drew out their opponent for the sprinters to tag.

Neither Amina nor Nomi could run very well, so they volunteered as 
guards. Ivory was practically bouncing with glee, and vowed to partner 
up with Ancelin (of course) to route out the other students. Blake Baum 
laughed with anticipation as she prepared her legs for a good jog. Vai 
Knox resolved herself to hunting down the flags with Rai and May. 
Victoria stood by and watched as Kula psyched herself up.

&quot;If we lose,&quot; she swore, &quot;I&#39;m gonna use you all as shields. I&#39;m not 
getting soaked! I want that ice cream!&quot;

&quot;I think everyone gets it, it&#39;s just that the winners get it first,&quot; 
said Nomi. Kula grinned.

&quot;Then let&#39;s not lose. Okay, everyone ready?&quot;

&quot;Good luck to you all,&quot; muttered Ms. Torvald. The girls stacked their 
hands on top of each other&#39;s and broke.

In war, only one can win.

To the juniors went the spoils: one of three points.

&quot;At least we got one flag,&quot; offered Amina quietly. Kula frowned.

&quot;Yeah, I guess so. I almost pity those poor sophomores, though, losing 
their flag like that. I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d be out of the race so soon. 
Heh.&quot; She chuckled, but she really wasn&#39;t happy that she didn&#39;t win. Of 
course, better to not lose than to fail, and keeping their original flag 
was no shameful matter. Next was the dance contest, and it was assumed 
that since the theme for that year was Wild West, most people would do 
hoedowns, square dances, and other ridiculous stunts, all to the sound 
of awful, worn-out country music. The music was dead-on, but the 
performances were not.

Janine alone could&#39;ve clenched the victory for the juniors, since she 
had years of dance experience under her belt. She didn&#39;t even need a 
partner; she performed magnificently all by herself. A few other girls 
did take partners&#151;as promised, Ethan had a slow dance with Avelina, and 
Blake, Mira, and Usha performed what might&#39;ve been interpreted as the 
spasms of a person going into convulsions before death&#151;but some competed 
against each other, performing backflips and break-dances and even, 
observed the crowds, a good impersonation of Curly spinning and running 
around the floor.

Ultimately it was the junior class that won, with first-year girls 
coming in a close second (Kula really wanted that prize), and seniors 
coming in dead last (in spite of the sweet Avelina-Ethan number). Before 
the girls could relax and bathe in the glow of the concert that had been 
scheduled for them, one last activity had to take place to declare the 
winner of the whole night, the quick-draw. Whoever was standing last for 
each class would be the Queen of her group, sure, but whoever remained 
at the very end would be the de facto winner, no questions asked, and 
would usher in delicious sweets for her team.

&quot;This reminds me of someone,&quot; mused Rai to herself as she was given a 
pistol. She was told by her sponsors that as more and more people were 
taken out of the contest, the guns would get bigger and the splashes 
wetter, thus increasing the &quot;risk&quot;. She took aim and fired off one shot 
onto the grass to test it. A few of the girls were already anxious to 
get going and douse their comrades; some seemed to care less. Alexis 
Walker squirted herself in the mouth to relieve her thirst and 
accidentally dribbled some on her shirt.

&quot;Oh, shit,&quot; she groaned. She looked up sheepishly and asked, &quot;So does 
this make me disqualified?&quot;

Everyone was paired off into twos, each with their backs turned against 
each other. They were instructed to find space, take five steps, turn, 
and fire. Squeals, shrieks, and laughter rose up as the girls gunned 
down their friends. May clutched her chest in mock agony as Kathlyn shot 
her down. Mira stuck her tongue out as Usha tagged her. Hero and Ayanna 
blasted each other, their aim too close to call, and Nomi quickly shot 
down Victoria. The ranks thinned and the losers filed away, some 
cheering their friends, others wringing their clothes dry.

It was becoming personal. Some girls wheeled around almost too quickly, 
while others kept firing even when they knew they won. Ancelin got 
soaked, so Ivory took it upon herself to avenge the loss. Vai got 
drenched by Alisha. Kula blew away her competition easily. Blake 
actually strafed to avoid fire (or water?) and nearly emptied her gun. 
Again and again, just like in The Quick and the Dead, women fell and 
were rooted out, some lamenting their loss, others relenting and 
rejoining friends or loved ones. Sometimes it was very hard to tell who 
shot who first, and a rematch was called. A few of the very aggressive 
girls found themselves soaking by the time they were disqualified.

Due to her competitive nature, Kula ended up triumphing over the entire 
first-year class, and howled in victory. As for the sophomores, Janine 
came out on top; Usha, of all people, won over the juniors, and after 
several upsetting victories and close calls, Rai won in the senior&#39;s 
division. Their respective sponsors congratulated them and gave them 
awards before turning them against each other. The few friends that Kula 
had made since transferring to Stanton began to fret as they watched her 
face off against Usha (Rai and Janine, for the record, looked pleased 
with the outcome, and agreed to not care who won&#151;they would both bathe 
each other mercilessly with the big guns).

Hero Love grinned. This was beginning to remind her of The Magnificent 
Seven, her favorite movie. Olivia kept her eyes open and her brows 
raised. Jocelyn pursed her mouth shut. Avelina held Ethan&#39;s hand. 
Gabrielle began to eye the ice cream hungrily. One, two, three, four, 
five&#151;BANG! The flowing water was glorious, ejaculating out of its 
plastic canister of doom by a quick thrust and pull of the trigger, 
splashing wetness all over its victim. People laughed out loud as Kula 
Nanahara was drenched, and even Usha chuckled. Kula just stood there, 
soaked all the way through, the last straw having broken her back.

To be beaten by Usha, of all people, by the use of water, her own 
element! This wasn&#39;t just intolerable, this was downright unforgivable! 
Without any restraint, Kula screamed out and slammed her fist right in 
Usha&#39;s face, shouting &quot;BITCH!!&quot; with all her might. Krishnan fell to the 
ground and Kula toppled after her, beating her lifeless again and again. 
The teachers were already making a mad dash to stop the fight, but they 
were overwhelmed by students crowding around to see. Mira van Dijk 
screamed a wicked obscenity in her own language and ran to avenge her 
love, but was suddenly floored by an enraged Kula.

&quot;What did you say to me, bitch?!&quot; she yelled. Now Blake was on the 
scene, and Alisha, and Zane and Alexis, and soon Furious Hail ran to 
join the fight, shouting &quot;Finally, somebody decked that bitch good!&quot; She 
got in a few blows, but was suddenly turned on by Kula, who despised 
ravers and druggies like Hail.

&quot;Stupid bitch, this is my fight!&quot; she yelled. Ivory Tran was already in 
the mix, whooping and hollering for joy: the bottled soda had been 
shaken far too long, and the contents had been released under the 
greatest pressure into the worst form of chaos imaginable. Soon nearly 
every girl, violent or otherwise, was in on the fight. A few brave 
teachers managed to dart in and pull out the cursing banshees&#151;Leena got 
an elbow in the face and Keeping had her toes smashed on&#151;but overall 
they could not control the battle. Bernadette Marbel watched in disgust, 
and finally came down to stop the fight herself. She was struck, of 
course, but those girls were soft and frail compared to the viciousness 
she had felt in her youth.

Eventually, security came in and separated the girls from each other, 
leaving only Kula and a bruised Usha (and, notably, an enraged Mira and 
an angry Blake). Dr. Andrews was on the scene, checking Usha and 
applying salve and painkillers in her quick professional manner; Kula 
herself was being held by two weary security guards. After taking a deep 
breath and assessing the damage&#151;fifteen wounded, one harshly, and plenty 
of destruction in the wake&#151;Marbel calmly walked to Kula, glanced at her, 
and frowned.

&quot;Do you have anything to say for yourself?&quot; Kula just spat at her feet. 
&quot;I see. You&#39;re not the first violent girl to pass through my halls, Miss 
Nanahara, nor are you the worst. But I can assure you, you&#39;ll wish you 
had restrained yourself before the night is over.&quot;

&quot;What, you gonna expel me?&quot;

&quot;Expulsion does nothing to improve character, it merely pushes it 
underneath the rug,&quot; stated the Headmistress in a strong voice. &quot;I do 
not believe in it, or even suspension. Punishment must be made to fit 
the crime, and in this case, it seems as if Miss Krishnan&#39;s medical 
bills should fall on your shoulders.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a hell of a lot,&quot; remarked Dr. Andrews, still examining the 
wounded lady. She looked up and gave Marbel a grim frown. &quot;This one 
really didn&#39;t have any mercy for her. She&#39;s going to have to be in the 
hospital for awhile.&quot;

&quot;Fuck you!&quot; screamed Mira, but she was held back before she could 
pounce. Marbel kept her calm and resumed speaking.

&quot;Let Miss van Dijk know that she will be punished as well, as will 
everyone who participated in this fight, no matter if your intentions 
were good or not.&quot; The girls groaned and screamed, some suing for mercy 
and fair play, but Marbel wouldn&#39;t have any of it.

&quot;So what&#39;re we in for now?&quot; asked Ivory, who had weathered the 
Headmistress&#39; discipline before. She couldn&#39;t help but notice a trace of 
a cruel smile playing on the older woman&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Well, that is a troublesome thing. Obviously my punishments aren&#39;t 
getting through to you, and there are lots of girls here who came only 
for the festivities, not to be harassed or witness a fracas. I will 
allow those who showed restraint to continue on, but as for you all...&quot; 
She addressed those whom she had gathered together, the ones she had 
seen fighting, and pointed to them all. &quot;You will be left out of the 
festivities.&quot; A few groaned, but Alisha waved her off.

&quot;Big deal. So we don&#39;t get to listen to some band or eat crappy ice 
cream.&quot;

&quot;Ah, but that&#39;s not your punishment,&quot; said Marbel (Ivory screamed for 
Alisha to shut up before she got them in more trouble&#151;but it was too 
late). &quot;Your punishment, the whole lot of you, will consist of two 
phases, personally overseen by myself and security. Mrs. Keys, Ms. 
O&#39;Brien, please resume the Homecoming in my stead; I have to take care 
of these girls.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am. Don&#39;t go too hard on them.&quot;

&quot;Janet, I will do what I must to reform them. The evening is in your 
hands; I trust you both to take care of it.&quot; They obeyed, and tried 
organizing everyone else back to the main event. A very soaked and very 
bruised Kula scowled as she and her &quot;chain gang&quot; were led off away from 
the Homecoming, right into the first half of their punishment&#151;right into 
the cold mouth of Hell, deeper than the frigid ninth circle.

.........

&quot;You have got to be kidding.&quot;

The girls recoiled as Marbel presented them their Herculean task: the 
entire school of Stanton, its halls and its bathrooms, its locker rooms 
and its classrooms, had all been presented to them, all of it in its 
filthy, disgusting, neglected glory. Marbel and the security team opened 
up several closets and handed each of the girls some cleaning material, 
purposely neglecting gloves. Kula stared angrily as she was given a 
toilet brush.

&quot;What&#39;re we supposed to do with these?!&quot;

&quot;Clean the entire school, girls,&quot; said Marbel coolly. &quot;You&#39;ve stained 
our reputation, see, in front of so many people. It&#39;s now your 
responsibility to clean it up. By the time everyone else goes home, I 
want this entire school spotless.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve gotta be fucking kidding me!&quot; screamed Ivory as she slammed her 
mop to the floor. Security stood in front of her, arms crossed, giving 
her faces that were not meant to be trifled with. Ancelin regarded Ivory 
with a sigh, and obediently took a rag and bucket.

&quot;Let&#39;s just get this over with,&quot; grumbled Furious Hail as she took a 
window cleaner. &quot;C&#39;mon, there&#39;s enough of us to get this done.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not cleaning the school!&quot; screamed Kula. &quot;Especially not the 
toilets!&quot;

&quot;Oh, but you will&#151;and after that, you&#39;re on garbage duty.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!!&quot;

&quot;Then part two of your punishment begins.&quot;

&quot;I oughta...&quot;

&quot;Ought to what, Miss Nanahara?&quot; said Marbel sharply, using her height as 
an advantage over the tan girl. The Headmistress might&#39;ve been getting 
bulgy and gray along with her age, but she was still tough, and had 
taken more abuse in five years than many people had in their whole 
lives. She wasn&#39;t afraid of anything, or at least not the young girls, 
and stood so firmly that even Kula backed off.

&quot;Just chill, girl,&quot; said Alexis calmly. &quot;Let&#39;s just do this quickly. 
I&#39;ll help you.&quot;

&quot;No, you won&#39;t Miss Walker,&quot; stated Marbel. &quot;Miss Nanahara can do it all 
by herself. Every bathroom and every toilet, Miss Nanahara, is your 
responsibility. If you fail to do even one, then you will be forced to 
do every single one again until you are through.&quot; The words hit Kula 
like an explosion, and although it made her angry, Marbel&#39;s words were 
laced with too much strength to go against. She roughly grabbed her 
brush back, and a bucket, and marched off to the nearest bathroom, the 
other girls going towards whatever spots they had been given. Bernadette 
Marbel crossed her arms coolly, and stood watch as her charges, her 
students, amended for their ways.

Mopping floors. Washing walls. Cleaning windows. Vacuuming. Emptying 
garbage cans. Cleaning filthy toilets with only a brush. Scrubbing 
floors. Polishing mirror. Backbreaking labor. Smelly, stinking toil. 
Degrading work&#151;they were being forced to work as janitors, all of them, 
even those who had stepped in valiantly and gotten caught in the fight. 
Ivory cursed. Aintzane groaned. Alexis wiped sweat from her brow. Mira 
and Blake grumbled. Alisha wheezed. Furious Hail muttered. Ancelin wore 
herself out. Farrah snorted. Kula gasped for air. The school&#39;s filth 
seemed to last forever.

The girls slaved themselves weary until eleven that night, when the 
Homecoming festivities concluded and everyone else went home. The school 
had been cleaned, although the troublemakers seemed to have absorbed all 
of its filth on their clothes. Marbel appraised them and approved of 
their work.

&quot;Good, good. Officer Lemley, did any of the girls stray from their 
task?&quot;

&quot;No ma&#39;am, they all did their job.&quot;

&quot;Good. The entire school is cleaned. Doesn&#39;t it feel good to be doing 
something for the community?&quot;

The women answered with acidic glares.

&quot;Well, the easy part is over,&quot; said Marbel. She didn&#39;t give the girls 
time to gawk as she continued. &quot;Now your responsibility is to clean up 
the soccer field for tomorrow. I&#39;m sure plenty of people left enough of 
a mess for you all to handle. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not as bad as it sounds, 
and I promise you will all have a nice shower or... two once you&#39;re 
done. I&#39;ve already gone through the trouble of telling your parents 
where you&#39;ll be, so you&#39;ll have lots to say to them in the morning. 
Well, get to it.&quot;

The women groaned, but their spirits were too broken to protest. The 
Headmistress sent them on their way, mercifully giving gloves to the 
half of the team she believed to be mostly innocent in the fight, and 
would&#39;ve pitied the others if they hadn&#39;t brought it all on themselves. 
She also asked that the stadium lights be left on, and gave each girl a 
large trash bag. Finally, she escorted them outdoors into the chilly 
air, threw on a jacket, sat down, and observed their work. First she 
called her wife.

&quot;Hello, Harmony? It&#39;s me. I&#39;ll be a little late. ...Well, at first they 
gave me trouble, but after awhile I got to them. ...Well it wasn&#39;t easy, 
I&#39;ll tell you that. ...Cleaning the soccer field. Those people really 
left a mess. ...It&#39;s really not very funny, but apology accepted. ...Oh, 
maybe midnight, maybe one, however long it takes for them to pick up all 
the litter. ...Yes, it is the work we chose. Thank God for weekends, 
though. ...All right, I&#39;ll see you later. Save a spot for me in bed. 
...I love you too.&quot;

She put the phone down and started to read a book. She counted herself 
fortunate to be so far away from the girls, because surely their cursing 
would&#39;ve upset her more. Ah, the tranquility of an autumn evening, spent 
under halogen lights with a good book and a host of willing prisoners 
working off their debts...

.........

It took the girls two agonizing hours and several false alarms, but at 
last, Stanton&#39;s proud soccer field was restored to its beautiful glory. 
All the delinquent girls had sacks full of garbage&#151;Kula had to clean up 
bags that had spilled liquid inside, and Ivory had to clean the ice 
cream trough&#151;and they stank like they had just rolled in a landfill. But 
they were finished, exhausted but finished, and humbled before the 
Headmistress. She gave them an approving smile.

&quot;Good, good. Well done. You&#39;ve earned my forgiveness. Hopefully you all 
will think twice before resorting to violence. I&#39;ve kept the locker room 
open, so please take a shower. I hope you brought a change of clothes 
with you.&quot; The girls just rolled their eyes and meandered to the shower, 
Blake pulling Mira aside.

&quot;I&#39;ve never worked so hard in my life.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. We should get compensation. It&#39;s not fair we are 
punished because we stood up for Yusha. We should get a reward.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, we weren&#39;t exactly trying to talk our way out of that. I 
hope Usha&#39;s okay.&quot;

&quot;...Me too. I really want to bash that fool&#39;s head in...&quot;

&quot;Just relax, okay?&quot; called Farrah, who had overheard the conversation. 
&quot;Kula got what she deserved, so let it go. No it&#39;s not fair that we got 
punished for being involved, but plenty of people got hurt on account of 
us. Let&#39;s just get cleaned and go home. Maybe we can all go out to eat 
tomorrow and forget about this whole mess.&quot;

&quot;Only if Kula foots the bill,&quot; said Blake wryly. The Hawaiian skater 
snorted past her as she shoved her way towards the showers.

&quot;Fat chance,&quot; she murmured. Blake, ever the peacemaker, called out to 
her in vain.

&quot;I was just kidding, okay? No need to take it personally!&quot;

Sigh.

&quot;Come on,&quot; whispered Mira, taking her beloved&#39;s hand. &quot;Let&#39;s go, we both 
stink. I will even let you look at me naked.&quot;

&quot;Mira!&quot; Blake grinned and blushed, along with her girlfriend, as they 
scampered into the locker room. Having overheard them, Ivory nudged 
Ancelin in the ribs.

&quot;So, Annie, do you think you and I could&#151;&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Ancelin entered the locker room by herself, leaving both Ivory and 
Alisha out. Tran crossed her arms and drew the stinking air in deep, 
exhaling it with a screech.

&quot;Cold,&quot; she said, &quot;that was utterly cold. But shit, I deserve it. Well, 
time to baptize myself and wash away all my nasty sins.&quot; She marched 
inside, Alisha behind her and Aintzane before her. What a way to start a 
weekend.</pre>
