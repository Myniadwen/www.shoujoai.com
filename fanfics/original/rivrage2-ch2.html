Boredom. That was the only thing Minato could say she felt right about 
now. But then, nothing really seemed interesting if you compared it to 
Natsumi Yakume. Which was what Minato had been doing, quite often in 
fact.  

The youngest of the Ikatsuji clan lied vertically across the simplistic 
bed and bedding of her dorm room, her arms folded beneath her head, her 
eyes staring straight up into the simple ceiling of the room. Ever 
since Natsumi left to visit her father and sisters back in Osaka, 
Minato had not really been able to focus on anything. Though Natsumi 
wasn&#39;t visiting the Yakume Shrine for long, it still hurt to be apart 
from her. It was something that Minato just could not put behind her. 
And the blonde girl could tell that her current behaviour was worrying 
Rinako. Although, Minato didn&#39;t doubt that there were things to worry 
about. And not just Natsumi, either. 

Ever since Rinako went berserk and nearly killed Zanga and his cohorts, 
Minato had been having dreams. They were vivid enough, though Minato 
could not specifically remember them when she woke from her sleep. But 
what bothered her was how regular and frequent they had become. She 
could roughly make out the setting, definitely ancient Japan, long 
before even the Asuka-Nara period. Many people... arguing... fighting 
and battling...  

And the reoccurring talks of a shapeless, unstoppable demon.  

Though she couldn&#39;t really say what these dreams meant, Minato could 
feel somehow that it was a... a sort of message. From who or for what 
purpose, that was to be unknown, but for how long? 

Needless to say, Minato kept these dreams to herself. The last thing 
she wanted to do was to worry about what Rinako would say about these 
dreams, so she decided to keep it all a secret. At the least for the 
moment. Just when Minato felt like crawling back into sleep to avoid 
her impending classes, the phone on her bedside table started to ring.  

{That&#39;s gotta be Natsumi!} She thought eagerly.  

In a flash, the receiver of her phone was at Minato&#39;s face. &quot;Hello?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s so good to hear your voice, Mina-chan.&quot; 

Minato was already swooning. &quot;Natsumi... I miss you so much... where 
are you? Are you home yet?&quot; 

&quot;Nah, not yet.&quot; Natsumi answered. &quot;I&#39;m still on the train, I&#39;m 
surprised you can&#39;t hear the clattering over there.&quot; 

&quot;Is it that bad?&quot; Minato asked. 

&quot;Well, let me put it this way. I wish I was old enough to drive.&quot; 

Minato giggled. Things were always like this between the two of them. 
If they weren&#39;t already a couple you&#39;d swear they were trying to flirt 
with each other. &quot;Well, I hope you get there soon.&quot; 

&quot;Me too. So how are things back in Tomeishuu?&quot; 

Minato thought about that. &quot;Not much has changed since you left 
yesterday. Principle Yagami has been on my case again about my lateness 
to class, but then he always punishes me for that, so...&quot; 

&quot;I gotcha.&quot; Natsumi said cheerfully. &quot;Nothing new. But as long as 
you&#39;re okay, I couldn&#39;t really care about anything else.&quot; 

The platinum blonde Ikatsuji sister twirled her finger around the 
plastic wire of the phone. &quot;...Natsumi... stop saying things like that. 
It makes me miss you even more...&quot; 

********** 

&quot;This must be the place.&quot; 

Out on the streets, in the beating heart of the Akihabara district of 
Tokyo, before a tall building, erected for the purpose of a gym, was a 
young girl, 16 years of age, very new to this city. She stood up 
sweetly, her innocent smile radiating the pure light that shone in her 
soul. Her face was framed with a long mane of pure black hair, so long 
it inched its way close to her waist. Her bright purple eyes sparkled 
like the finest jewels refined from the deepest caverns of the earth&#39;s 
core. This girl&#39;s name was Reikibu Somenosuke Tsukuji.  

Or just plain &#39;Rei&#39; for short.  

It was a few hours after school broke up for the day this Rei decided 
to visit a new... friend of hers and young girl reflected on her past 
few weeks before she entered the gym she was standing in front of. Rei 
had transferred to Tomeishuu High from her previous school around three 
weeks ago. Although she was very shy by nature, Rei had made fast 
friends with a lot of the Tomeishuu girls, Rinako, Minato, Natsumi and 
Mishizu included, but there was one person who Rei had come to value a 
whole lot more. A girl who was currently training inside the gym that 
Rei was standing in front of. 

Ayaka Yakazaki. 

She and Ayaka shared a dorm room at Tomeishuu High, so they had met 
each other shortly after Rei had been introduced to the school. From 
the moment they met, Rei and Ayaka became fast friends. Since Ayaka had 
been a Spring Breeze Assassin of high ranking for quite some time, she 
could show Rei everything Tomeishuu had to offer and more. And for the 
past three weeks, the brunette had been spending much time with Ayaka. 
Which was why she was standing before the gym that Ayaka trained at. 
The Yakazaki girl was a pretty good martial artist; some said that she 
was on par with Izumi herself. And because of this, she had to keep her 
skills at there best. Ayaka wasn&#39;t like Rinako and Ayane. Although they 
trained just as much as she did, fighting was almost second nature to 
those two. For Ayaka, fighting was much more new, uncharted territory, 
since she had only started training a year ago. And so, Ayaka stopped 
over at her gym on a very regular basis. So Rei decided to pay her a 
visit.  

The young girl stepped through the unmarked door to the upstairs gym, 
climbing up a long set of stairs with all the effort her legs could 
muster. Soon she reached the door that truly led inside into the gym, 
pushing it forward. The equally unmarked door (albeit a few scratches) 
swung open to reveal a large upper room, filled with lots of curious 
machines for a powerful workout- and the burly, muscled men who worked 
out on them. The young innocent Rei suddenly felt very small and very 
insignificant as many of these chiselled giants eyed her over with a 
mixture of contempt, humour and a little curiosity.  

Rather than think about and acknowledge the grunts and moans she was 
hearing around her, Rei timidly made her way through the gym in search 
of Ayaka before some questioned her. 

Too late.  

A large man, around 35 in age, wearing only shorts and a sports shirt 
turned a darker colour from the sweat of his tested body. He inspected 
the young Rei with his probing black eyes, knowing that he had never 
seen her before.  

&quot;And who might you be, little girl?&quot; He asked. &quot;This gym is membership 
only, I&#39;m afraid. Besides... this might not be the best place for such 
a pretty little thing.&quot; 

Rei blushed a little, take the opportunity to look away. &quot;I-I&#39;m just 
here to see someone. I don&#39;t want to join this club...&quot; 

&quot;Well who do you want to see?&quot; He asked.  

Someone else answered that question. &quot;She&#39;s here to see me.&quot; 

Both Rei and the gym member looked behind them as a voice called out to 
them. It was a young blonde woman, shimmering blue eyes and a 
surprisingly feminine physique, despite the fact that she was in such a 
place. Rei could only smile as she saw her. &quot;Ayaka...&quot; 

Ayaka Yakazaki swiped the sweat off her forehead with her towel as she 
stepped forwards, and let it rest around her shoulders. Before long she 
was at Rei&#39;s side, wrapping a protective arm around the shorter girl.  

&quot;She&#39;s with me, Yuzunosuke-san.&quot; Ayaka commented. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about 
it, I&#39;m leaving in a few minutes.&quot; 

Yuzunosuke nodded. &quot;There&#39;s no rush. If that girl&#39;s an acquaintance of 
yours then I can&#39;t kick her out, can I?&quot; 

Ayaka grinned as she walked with Rei into a separate room. &quot;I should 
think not.&quot; Her attention turned back to Rei. &quot;Are you okay? Those guys 
can be pretty intimidating.&quot; 

Rei just nodded, smiling up at the taller girl. &quot;I&#39;m okay. Especially 
since you&#39;re here.&quot; 

Just for a few seconds, Ayaka had to look way to keep herself from 
being blinded by Rei&#39;s billion-yen smile. She suddenly regretted 
putting her arm around Rei. The closeness between the two of them was 
something that bothered Ayaka to no end (even though it was her fault). 
Truth be told, Ayaka just wanted to send a signal to the younger 
members of the gym that Rei was *not* going to be the next target for 
their wedding tackles. She did *not* like the looks that Rei was 
receiving from her weight lifting peers either. Even though the two had 
known each other for only a few weeks, Ayaka was VERY protective of 
Rei. So much so that Ayaka had sworn to cripple anyone who tried to lay 
as much as a finger on her. The innocent Rei had a way of working a 
spell on people. And Ayaka was apparently the latest victim. Though she 
was unnerved by the closeness of the beauteous Rei, Ayaka just let 
herself enjoy it for the most part. It wasn&#39;t that she wanted space 
from Rei, far from it. She was worried about what secrets her heart 
might reveal if they got too close...  

The two young women walked up into a separate room, many windows 
abound, a few tatami mats laid out across the floorboards. Ayaka 
reluctantly removed her arm from Rei&#39;s shoulder and walked to the other 
side of the room, sitting down on one of the mats. Rei stood by the 
doorway, watching Ayaka spread out her legs to stretch before she begun 
her katas.  

Without looking back, Ayaka called out to Rei. &quot;Something wrong?&quot; 

Rei shook her head. &quot;N-No... not at all. I&#39;m glad you invited me here. 
I&#39;ve never been to a gym before.&quot;  

&quot;Really?&quot; 

Rei nodded sweetly. &quot;Uh huh.&quot; 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t mind dealing with all this.&quot; Ayaka began to 
stretch, still talking to Rei. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Yuzunosuke gave you the third 
degree. He was like that with me at first, but when he started to train 
me, his views changed. It won&#39;t happen again.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Ayaka. I don&#39;t mind.&quot; 

Ayaka grinned. &quot;Yeah? Well I do. But it won&#39;t be happening again. So 
what do you want to do when I&#39;m finished here? Would you like to head 
down to Shinjuku and catch up with some of the other girls?&quot; 

Rei slowly started to walk over to the tatami mat that Ayaka was 
stretching on. &quot;Well... maybe, but... I...&quot; 

A kink from Ayaka&#39;s neck was removed with a small snap as she held a 
firm hand in massage to it. &quot;What&#39;s up, Rei?&quot; 

Rei took a seat next to Ayaka. &quot;Well... you know a lot about this... 
martial arts stuff, right?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; 

&quot;And... pretty much anyone could be a martial artist if they wanted to, 
and if they put enough energy into it... right?&quot; 

Ayaka didn&#39;t really see it that way, but... &quot;...What&#39;s your point, Rei? 
Is there something you want to know about?&quot; 

The dark haired girl nodded. &quot;...Y-Yes...&quot; 

&quot;Well, what is it?&quot; 

Rei took a deep breath. &quot;...Will you teach me how to be a martial 
artist?&quot; 

Ayaka instantly stopped stretching. &quot;What...?&quot; 

&quot;Well...?&quot; Rei questioned timidly. &quot;Will you?&quot; 

&quot;You want to learn martial arts. *You*.&quot; Ayaka said sceptically.  

Though Ayaka meant no harm, Rei was a little thrown by how surprised 
she was by this. &quot;...Don&#39;t you think I can do it...?&quot; 

Ayaka preferred not to answer that. &quot;Why would you even want to learn 
this sort of thing?&quot; 

Rei&#39;s eyes darted away from Ayaka&#39;s blue gaze. Soon she was racked with 
thoughts of her older cousin... &quot;I just... it&#39;s important to me, 
Ayaka.&quot; 

&quot;Rei... it&#39;s dangerous.&quot; Ayaka said. &quot;Not only will you need to work 
hard... you could get hurt... I can&#39;t take that risk with you.&quot; 

&quot;But Ayaka-&quot; 

Rei was sharply cut off. &quot;No, Rei. I&#39;m sorry. I won&#39;t do it.&quot; 

&quot;Oh.&quot; The disappointment in her voice was clear. So much that it 
concerned Ayaka. But Rei didn&#39;t let it dwell on her. There were other 
options... &quot;I... understand Ayaka. F-Forget I mentioned it...&quot; 

********** 

{This is it. I&#39;m home...} 

It was around 9.00 in the pitch of night that the shrine priestess 
Natsumi arrived back at the Yakume Shrine. Her home. It had been so 
long since she had been here... nearly four months in fact. But here 
she was, and the place still looked as it had done when she had left. 
Natsumi had to admit; she was worried about how the shrine would cope 
after she left. Her father, Tetsuya, was not the type to maintain 
organization by himself, he was much more concerned with the ceremonies 
and such. Natsumi&#39;s sisters, Tomomi and Yuri, they were very much the 
eye of an average teen. Between the two of them, Tomomi and Yuri&#39;s 
thoughts were centred on three things.  

Boys, boys and boys.  

Still, everything was in order. The shrine steps were nicely swept, the 
surrounding statues were untainted, and nothing seemed out of the 
ordinary. Natsumi smiled a little as she began walking up the steps to 
the shrine&#39;s innards. 

&quot;So they managed to keep this place in one piece... I&#39;m actually kinda 
impressed. The only other thing that would prove I&#39;m home would be the 
squealing of Tomomi-&quot; 

&quot;NATSUMIIIIIIIII!!!!!&quot; 

Natsumi squinted as her younger sister, Tomomi, came charging down the 
steps to hug her big sister. The dark haired woman was nearly thrown 
off her feet as Tomomi hurled herself into Natsumi&#39;s arms.  

&quot;Oh, Natsumi!&quot; Tomomi said excitedly. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re back! It&#39;s 
been a nightmare without you here! Daddy&#39;s been making us do all your 
chores and everything! He won&#39;t even let me date anymore! So how have 
you been? Did you meet any cute guys in Tokyo? What was Tomeishuu High 
like? Can I go there? Did you miss me?&quot; 

Natsumi sweatdropped from Tomomi&#39;s innocent tirade of questions. &quot;Hold 
up there, Tomomi! Gimme a chance to breathe first, okay?&quot; 

Tomomi reluctantly released her tight hug around her older sister. 
&quot;Sorry, Natsumi. I&#39;m just so glad to see you!&quot;  

&quot;I know. It&#39;s nice to see you too.&quot; Natsumi said, ruffling her sister&#39;s 
hair. &quot;So how is Yuri? Is she alright?&quot; 

Tomomi nodded. &quot;Uh huh. She&#39;s fine. She went out shopping in the market 
to pick up some stuff for Daddy; I dunno what he needs it for though. 
He said that he wants to talk to you as soon as you got back, as well.&quot; 

Natsumi&#39;s gaze became distant, as she thought about what might be going 
through the mind of her father. The current threat remaining with 
Aerolust... it had to be dealt with. Natsumi knew this for sure.  

&quot;I better see father then, Tomomi.&quot; Natsumi said, stepping up the steps 
again. Before she could get too far, Tomomi scampered up alongside her 
in pursuit.  

&quot;But we NEED to talk, Natsumi!&quot; Tomomi said eagerly. &quot;I wanna hear all 
about your times in Tokyo!&quot; 

&quot;Later, Tomomi.&quot;  

Tomomi stood in place and watched her sister enter the shrine. Natsumi 
had suddenly become distracted and distant, just like her father had 
been acting just recently. Though Tomomi was young, even she could tell 
when something was up. There was definitely something going down. 
Natsumi plied through room after room of the cavernous Yakume Shrine, 
until she finally reached her own room. Nothing had changed here 
either. All her posters of the Gentatsu boys, Yusaku Kudo, and the 
Eight Dragons were still up on the wall. All her miniatures were in 
tact and all her books were unmoved. Home sweet home. The Yakume girl 
didn&#39;t bother to think any more about this though, and threw her 
suitcase on the bed. She&#39;d unpack later. As quick as lightning, Natsumi 
was out the room and heading towards the main hall. She was sure that 
would be where her father was.  

And sure enough, she was right.  

Natsumi&#39;s eyes narrowed in on Tetsuya as she stepped up to the door to 
the main hall. It was night right now, so the lights were on in the 
shrine. She could clearly make out Tetsuya&#39;s silhouette in the hall. 
Natsumi took a deep breath and slid open the door, walking through 
slowly. Tetsuya was sitting in a cross-legged position, his arms 
crossed and his back facing the door. He was obviously meditating. In a 
slightly odd position, none the less.  

Tetsuya didn&#39;t bother to wait for Natsumi to introduce her own arrival. 
&quot;Welcome home, Natsumi.&quot; 

&quot;Father...&quot; Natsumi breathed. &quot;Did you sense my presence?&quot; 

Tetsuya sweatdropped, coughing into his fist. &quot;No, I... heard Tomomi&#39;s 
scream of joy...&quot; 

Natsumi chuckled a little. Things at the Yakume Shrine were never easy, 
but she missed it sometimes. Sure, she loved Tomeishuu, and all her 
friends, and her girl, Minato, but this was where she grew up. All her 
memories were here and they would always hold a special place inside 
her heart. The young woman stepped forward to be face to face with her 
father. As she reached him, she crouched down, tucking her feet beneath 
her body in a traditional Japanese sitting style. Uncomfortable as all 
hell though.  

&quot;Should I start from the beginning?&quot; Natsumi asked quietly.  

Tetsuya nodded. &quot;I would appreciate it if you did.&quot; 

&quot;Okay... well, I went to Tomeishuu High as you requested... and I 
observed Ayane for a while, to see if our suspicions were correct. She 
showed no signs of possession, and for the majority of my first three 
weeks there, nothing happened. However, the Shunshibaru crystal reacted 
to the girl, Rinako Ikatsuji.&quot; 

Tetsuya&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Stop right there...&quot; He said. &quot;...Rinako 
Ikatsuji? Is she related to Genzo Ikatsuji, the current master of Rai 
shou en ken?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; Natsumi said humbly. &quot;She is one of his... daughters.&quot; 

&quot;He has another child then?&quot; 

Natsumi nodded, blushing a little. &quot;Yes. A really great girl named 
Minato... Minato Ikatsuji.&quot; 

Tetsuya continued on. &quot;So these two practice Rai shou en ken just as 
Ayane Yosukube does?&quot; 

&quot;Nah, only Rinako. Minato is not a martial artist.&quot; 

Tetsuya thought for a second. &quot;I see. Well, regardless, continue.&quot; 

&quot;Okay. The crystal started to glow when she and I... exchanged words. 
So from then one I assumed that Rinako was the seal child. Then there 
was the incident I told you about. During a battle, Aerolust possessed 
Rinako... but she somehow managed to shake off the grip it had on her. 
She has shown no signs of residual possession thus far, but I still 
kept my eye on her. My search for the seal child has also left us with 
nothing. I have no leads now. So... that&#39;s what I have to tell you.&quot; 

Tetsuya thought to himself again, shutting his eyes for a brief second 
to get this all into his head. &quot;So... Aerolust has scattered. The 
ancient scrolls state that Aerolust needs to recover after being 
expelled from a mortal body. But they speak nothing of the time it will 
take Aerolust to recuperate. This is a good thing... but that incident 
was three months ago, yes?&quot; 

Natsumi confirmed that. &quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;Hmm... Aerolust is aware of the strength of Rinako... that probably 
means that it will come after her again. If she is not protected, then 
the beast might possess her once more. And if it takes full control... 
then there is no telling the damage it could do. We must find the seal 
child at all costs, Natsumi.&quot; 

&quot;I understand that.&quot; Natsumi uttered. &quot;But I&#39;m telling you, my search 
has come up with nothing. The Shunshibaru crystal doesn&#39;t react to 
Rinako anymore either. My search has come up with no results.&quot; 

&quot;Damn... If only we could-&quot; Tetsuya cut himself off when a new thought 
came to mind. &quot;Wait a minute... the crystal stopped reacting to the 
Ikatsuji girl? And it did so at the beginning? Is that what you are 
telling me?&quot; 

Natsumi nodded. &quot;Yup.&quot; 

&quot;Hand me the Shunshibaru crystal, Natsumi.&quot; 

Without a second thought Natsumi stuck her hand into her pocket and 
fished out the Shunshibaru crystal. Natsumi presented the shining white 
jewel to her father, who instantly took it into his hand.  

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; He mused. &quot;...Natsumi... I think we may have misinterpreted 
the scrolls somehow...&quot;</pre>
