Ichijiteki Park

School started in fifteen minutes. Kimagure Gakuen didn&#39;t have a 
habit of ringing their bells late. Uchida Haruko knew that quite 
well. So she couldn&#39;t very well stand around her all day. The 
blonde class representative gave another look around from the 
tree she was standing by in Ichijiteki Park. It was early 
Thursday morning. Haruko had intended to go straight to school 
as usual, but something was nestled in the post before she left 
in the morning. It was an un-addressed letter marked with 
Haruko&#39;s name. She took it with her when she left for school and 
then opened it on the way there. It read;

&quot;Haruko-chan. I have something I need to say to you. Meet me at 
the front gate of Ichijiteki Park at 8.30, before morning 
classes start. I&#39;ll be waiting for you.&quot;

Even now, Haruko was taking the letter out of her pocket and 
re-reading it. She had no idea who wrote it or who wanted to 
meet her here. She couldn&#39;t tell who it was by the calligraphy 
of the katakana and kanji either. Which was strange; because she 
was usually so good at that. So Haruko just waited for this 
person to show up. Whoever they were. But she found it out soon 
enough. The younger of the Uchida siblings turned to her right 
when she heard the sound of light footsteps. And her expression 
morphed into a smile from seeing the person there. Yui. Dressed 
in only a white Tokyo-Zappers tee shirt, denims and a pair of 
trainers. Out of her school uniform. Regardless, Haruko strode 
up to Yui with a giggle in her throat; more than happy to see 
the normally timid girl.

Haruko stopped and smiled. &quot;Yui-san! I can&#39;t believe that you&#39;re 
here! Watanabe-sensei got a sick note from you saying that you 
wouldn&#39;t be attending classes for a while. So how come? What did 
you have?&quot;

Unlike the normally weak and timorous way that Yui acted before, 
she was very stern and serious. Even the smile that she was 
giving Haruko seemed... forced. Haruko noticed this. But she 
didn&#39;t quite know what to make of it. Yui seemed a little 
different today. As if she had been made aware of something 
or... had discovered something that had allowed her a new quiet 
confidence. A private confidence.

Haruko tilted her head to the side, searching Yui&#39;s dazzling 
bottle green eyes for an answer to this sudden change in her 
disposition. &quot;...Is something wrong? So seem a little... 
distracted. Are you still feeling sick? Is that why you&#39;re not 
wearing your school uniform? ...Aren&#39;t you going in for classes 
today?&quot;

The silent but atypically decided Yui looked up at her friend, 
eye level. &quot;...No. I&#39;m not going to class today. And I... might 
not be coming to class here... ever again.&quot;

That was a little confusing. Haruko&#39;s eyes thinned out; showing 
this confusion. Just what did Yui mean by that remark? She 
understood that the girl might not be feeling very well, but she 
couldn&#39;t use that to skip school indefinitely. That was just... 
nuts. Then the bolt of lightning called realization struck 
Haruko down like a tree in a thunderstorm. Emissions of both 
worry and assumption filled her. But none of them were 
completely misplaced. 

Haruko blinked, her gentle voice growing shallow. &quot;...Y-You&#39;re 
not... leaving are you...?&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t know...&quot; What could Yui say besides that? If Haruko 
knew what she and Hibuki intended to do then she&#39;d know that Yui 
had every reason to say this. Entering the Shinrin Jinja could 
be the last thing she ever did. And Yui didn&#39;t want Haruko 
thinking that she ran away or disappeared without a trace. In 
the Hazumaru girl&#39;s mind; it felt better to make the Uchida girl 
believe she was leaving by choice. The last thing she ever 
wanted would be to hurt Haruko by &#39;vanishing&#39;. Because there was 
always the outcome... that she&#39;d die in the Shinrin Jinja. 

&quot;...I might be,&quot; Yui finally continued, &quot;I don&#39;t know yet. It&#39;s 
hard to explain. But before anything happens at all... I just 
wanted to tell you something...&quot;

This was all pretty much going straight over Haruko&#39;s head so 
she just went with the flow and followed along with what Yui was 
telling her. &quot;...Which is?&quot;

Well Yui didn&#39;t have much to say as she did something to show. 
The young brunette looked downwards again and mustered something 
inside herself. Breathing slowly, thinking swiftly. Then she 
acted instantly. Throwing her arms around Haruko&#39;s neck and 
wrapping her in a protective yet sweetly gentle hug. Haruko 
blinked with surprise, feeling Yui lean into her ear to speak. 

&quot;Haruko-chan,&quot; She voiced softly, &quot;In the week or so that I&#39;ve 
been living in Tokyo... I&#39;ve seen a lot of things and met new 
people. But you&#39;re the best thing about this town. And before I 
go, I really want you to know that... I&#39;m so very glad that you 
are my friend... but your friendship... means more to me than 
just that. Haruko-chan, I... &quot;

It would be pretty obvious to anyone that Hazumaru Yui was not 
the kind of girl who expressed her emotions very easily. But 
necessity often made heavy demands on the human heart. Which was 
why her following action took so much effort. The brown-haired 
woman took a deep breath and gave a firm, quick lick of her lips 
with her tongue, moistening them. Then time simply slowed down 
as Yui tilted her head to the right and pressed her lips against 
those of the class representative, Uchida Haruko. The blonde 
froze with both shock and surprise as Yui kissed her. Feeling 
the softness of the slightly shorter girl&#39;s lips. Their warmth. 
And a passion that leaked out as easily as anything. Before she 
even knew what she was doing, Haruko dropped her note &amp; bookbag 
and grabbed Yui by the cheeks, tilting her head to the side and 
parting her mouth for better entry. Yui&#39;s hands fell to Haruko&#39;s 
waist with the action, gripping them tightly, but with a 
softness that was so neglected by her other form, that of Shiki. 
And the two remained their, simply kissing, displaying an 
affection that was very new to them... but also... very 
appropriate. Though neither Haruko nor Yui could have understood 
it very well... there were strong emotions that were binding 
them together. Neither of them could have resisted it. Nor would 
they have wanted to.

But as easily as the beautiful moment came, it ended. Before Yui 
lost her herself, she abruptly broke the kiss between herself 
and the Uchida girl, taking a breath. Haruko did the same, 
though her eyes expressed great confusion. She couldn&#39;t help but 
ask herself, why had Yui pulled back like that? 

Yui tried to ignore the wetness in her eyes as she said this. 
&quot;Goodbye, Haruko-chan...&quot;

As soon as she loosened her embrace over Haruko, Yui stepped 
backwards and ran for the other side of the park as quickly as 
she could. Haruko looked on with both confusion and... a little 
heart break. Yui was saying goodbye? After that...? Without even 
stopping to see how Haruko felt about this? Or listening to her 
case for Yui to stay? 

&quot;Yui-san!&quot; She yelled desperately, &quot;Wait!&quot;

But there was no way that the Uchida Sister could have caught up 
to Yui at the speed she was going with. Nor would she be able to 
hear any words. Yui ran right around the cobblestone corner that 
navigated around a tall-fenced off bush. Inside that bush was 
her shinobi clothing, Miyuki, her mouth-mask and her fresh stock 
of shuriken (a new, sharper set made by the very patron of the 
Kakugame Jinja, Master Genryukai) all bunched together. Across 
from that bush on the other side of the stone pathway was Uchida 
Hibuki. In normal street clothes, just like Yui was. He hadn&#39;t 
seen any of what had happened. But her knew full well of the 
situation between Yui and Haruko. He&#39;d have had to be blind not 
to. 

Hibuki crossed his arms. &quot;Did you say your goodbyes?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yui didn&#39;t look back at her new partner, &quot;...I have 
every intention of coming out of this fight alive. But I can&#39;t 
assure it. So I just wanted her to know how much she meant to 
me... in case I do die.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not gonna die.&quot; Hibuki said, frowning.  

&quot;Maybe so. But I just had to do it. Haruko is... very important 
to me, even though we haven&#39;t known each other long. I just 
wanted to let her know that. And to make sure that she didn&#39;t 
worry about me if I never come back. Now I can focus on the 
Shinrin Jinja with a clear head.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Outside the Shinrin Jinja

For a relatively sunny morning... there was a glacially cold 
wind passing through the streets of Tokyo. Not lost on the quiet 
dignity of the Shinrin Jinja. Cut off from the rest of the city 
with its pride. Beside the tall metal gates that blocked off 
outsiders from the precinct was a long chain of newly planted 
(about 30 years ago) oak trees. Upon one of those oak trees were 
Shiki and Hibuki. Watching the shrine with stern eyes. Hirotsugu 
was inside that place. As was Yagami. It was finally time to 
settle the fate of the Honshu Koga. Shiki crouched down on one 
branch of the tall oak tree she and her partner were on. Fully 
geared up, with her facial wrappings nudged tight along her 
face, her twenty shuriken in her twin thigh pockets (ten on 
either side) and Miyuki strapped to her back waist. Hibuki stood 
on a branch just a little ways higher than Shiki&#39;s. And he had 
left his Kabuki Cat Mask this time. There was no need to hide 
his identity from anyone anymore. 

&quot;So that&#39;s the place that Hirotsugu-yarou&#39;s been hiding in, 
huh?&quot; Shiki mentioned, &quot;I would have never guessed it.&quot;

Hibuki pressed his gloved palm into the bark of the oak tree. 
&quot;...It&#39;s flashy enough for his twisted tastes. And it&#39;s even 
bigger than it looks from the outside. But you should be able to 
get to Hirotsugu quickly. The layout of the place is really 
straightforward.&quot;

Shiki looked up at Hibuki. &quot;...I hope so. I don&#39;t intend to drag 
this out. I might even be able to kill Hirotsugu-yarou before 
Yagami-san gets a whiff of it. If I&#39;m fast enough.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t count on it,&quot; The Uchida shinobi answered, 
&quot;Yagami-san is as clever as he is powerful. He will be expecting 
us. But whatever you unlocked from the Scroll of Mizuryu should 
be enough to at least put up a better fight than before.&quot;

Shiki grinned darkly. &quot;Like you wouldn&#39;t believe. Now lets get 
this show on the road. I need to get inside the shrine as 
quietly as possible. So I could use a nice little distraction 
for the lesser ninja to cope with while I get myself in there.&quot;

To that, Hibuki nodded, forging his left hand into the 
two-fingered sign of the shinobi. Then let his eyes slip closed 
to prepare for his little distraction. It would take more effort 
than usual because Hibuki hadn&#39;t used this Ninjutsu in a while. 
But it was better than nothing. Ryoko&#39;s skills with illusion had 
inspired it... so it was only fitting that Hibuki used its power 
to help take down the Honshu Koga. His focus went away from that 
large oak tree and towards the front doors of the Shinrin Jinja. 
They were guarded by two security guards (dressed in dark suits 
and sunglasses) at all times. But they were not the real guards 
for the shrine. Just drones used as a lure. In the long stone 
path that led up to the front doors was a puddle of rain water 
that had generated during the night rain. Just what Hibuki 
needed. The water rippled a little. Then began to rise up in a 
collective and solid but writhing form. That water soon began to 
reach a height of around six feet. Then began to take on a 
humanoid form. Legs, arms, feet, hands, and a face. 

Soon vibrant colour began to pour into the apparition, giving 
way to a complete form. A replica of the real Hibuki. Weapons, 
clothing, face and all. The Hibuki-clone soon gave a powerful 
grin, faced off with the guards, made the two-fingered sign and 
deftly spoke, 

&quot;Mizuppoi Gizou Harada... Hibuki no Henka!&quot; 
(Watery Counterfeit Body...  Hibuki&#39;s Variation!)

The two guards at the far doors of the Shinrin Jinja blinked 
with confusion. No surprise there. Security was very tight 
around the shrine. How could someone have snuck in so easily? 
But no matter what that meant, those two burly muscular men ran 
from the doors and instantly went for the Hibuki Water Clone. 
The replica smiled at the two of them and reached around its 
back for its copy of the real Hibuki&#39;s short sword, Tsumeitai 
Ryuu Ga (Cold Dragon Fang). The first of those surly bodyguards 
came up and loomed over the shorter, Hibuki-copy. 

&quot;You!&quot; The guard yelled aloud, &quot;This is private property! Now 
you better get your ass out of here before we remove you with 
force!&quot;

The Hibuki Clone continued smiling but didn&#39;t say a word. It 
simply pulled Tsumeitai Ryuu Ga from its sheath and slashed in a 
brutal downwards motion. The guards screamed in agony as the 
blade hacked right through his shoulder, chest and stomach and 
cut back out at the waist. Blood spewed freely as the body 
collapsed into two halves, falling downwards into a bloody pile. 
The remaining guard trembled with fear as the Hibuki replica 
came for him. It charged with all the speed and fluidity of the 
raging river; and horizontally slashed at him. From the waist 
upwards, the body of the security guard was sent into the air 
with a sickening build up of blood, bone and guts twirling 
around it. The hacked corpse splattered all over the ground. 
Cold and dead. The Hibuki clone smiled again and sheathed its 
sharp duplicate of the Tsumeitai Ryuu Ga. It stood silently 
before the Shinrin Jinja; making its mark. Now it was just a 
matter of the Mizuryu Clan ninja taking the bait. 

Which they did. 

Eight swift blurs shot down around the Hibuki Clone from the 
air, surrounding him. They formed into eight lesser shinobi; 
dressed in grey ninja outfits and armed with short swords and 
shuriken pouches. These were the real guards of the Shinrin 
Jinja. Now they had been lured out of the filthy rocks they had 
been waiting under. Over by the oak tree; the authentic Hibuki 
was maintaining his focus for the Water-borne copy of himself. 
While Shiki was using her Mind&#39;s Eye to probe the Shinrin Jinja 
for someone to use Shunhenkou with.  

She opened her eyes and scowled. &quot;...Damn! There&#39;s some kind of 
spell over the entire shrine that&#39;s preventing me from using 
Shunhenkou to get inside it! Like a firewall!&quot;

&quot;Guess you&#39;ll have to sneak in the old fashioned way,&quot; Hibuki 
said steeling himself, &quot;And I&#39;ll keep these guys busy while you 
do.&quot;

Shiki nodded her thanks. Then made her move. The elongated 
wrappings attached to her  face whipped around her head as she 
adroitly jumped into air; sailing off the sturdy branch of the 
oak tree. She came back down with swift movement and landed upon 
the gardens of grass beneath. Then made a quick dash across 
those lush gardens towards the very building they surrounded. In 
seconds she was on course for a collision with the large metal 
railings that blocked off outsiders from intrusion. Shiki 
grinned behind her mouth mask and leapt straight over black 
metal fence. Her body glided over it like an eagle on the breeze 
and she made a soft landing. She was within the temple precinct. 
But she spared no time to admire it. Shiki began running towards 
the Shinrin Jinja itself, but towards the left side of the 
sanctuary. And while she did that; she managed to hazard a 
glimpse at the front gates. Hibuki&#39;s Water Copy was still 
fighting off the minor ninja of the Mizuryu Clan. And from the 
looks of it, the duplicate was really holding its own. Which was 
good; because Shiki didn&#39;t want to waste time worrying about 
whether or not Hibuki could hold his own. The girl moved swiftly 
from one part of the inner gardens to the other; darting in 
swift strides that took her all the way up to the left wall of 
the Shinrin Jinja. To one of the side entrances (in the shape of 
a rather small wooden door) that had now been left unattended. 
Shiki stopped as she came to the tiny wood door lodged into the 
face of the side wall. She then rotated her smooth body, drew up 
her leg, and smashed it through the small wooden compartment 
with a brutal kick. From years and years of ninja training; 
Shiki knew how to break things and make as little noise as 
possible at the same time. But very little could have smothered 
the sound of that. Regardless, Shiki dove through that small 
opening as best she could. Her torso shot through the 
window-sized gap and rolled into the pine wooden floors of the 
Shinrin Jinja. She was inside.
