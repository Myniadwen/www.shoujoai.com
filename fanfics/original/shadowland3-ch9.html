<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 9 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Jessica gazed out the window of the Head Mistress&#39;s car as they drove 
through the winding city streets of the town that existed outside of 
Whispering Hills Academy. A town without a name or purpose other then to 
surround the school, giving the girls access to food and the activities. 
Jessica sometimes wondered why it was that the school and the town even 
existed. After her encounter with her sisters in the dream world she was 
beginning to wonder the purpose of any of this. In the distance she 
could see the sun setting on yet another day and she shivered as a cold 
autumn breeze found its way into the car and she rubbed at her bare 
arms, wishing she had grabbed a jacket on the way out, or at least wore 
something heavier then cargo pants and a camouflage tank top. 

&quot;There is a jacket in the back.&quot; Sophia offered, noticing the girl&#39;s 
shivers, &quot;Maybe you should put it on.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jessica reached into the back seat and grabbed a red fleece 
flannel jacket off the seat and thought about how it, combined with her 
current attire, made her look more like a dyke then before. She gazed at 
herself in the mirror affixed to the inside of the overhead visor and 
shook her head at her buzzed cut, spiked, hair. She hoped these new 
girls did not have a problem with her outwardly appearing lesbian, 
because she was afraid she might scare them, &quot;Whose is this?&quot; She 
inquired curiously as she pulled the jacket on to find it fit snuggly. 

Sophia shrugged, &quot;It has been there for years. I just keep forgetting to 
remove it.&quot; She remarked then turned down another street and wove her 
way through the centre of the town. 

Jessica looked over the jacket as many questions entered her mind, 
questions she would never utter aloud around the Head Mistress for fear 
of the punishment that may ensue. It was a general rule of the Academy 
not to ask about those who have recently left the school and yet she now 
wanted to know what is really beyond this town, or if there really was a 
life for her outside of Whispering Hills? 

&quot;What is on your mind?&quot; Sophia inquired, glancing towards the girl every 
now and then. 

Jessica considering saying something, but changed her mind and turned 
her eyes out the passenger window. 

&quot;You still angry that I&#39;m making you stay here longer?&quot; She asked 
knowingly. 

Jessica crossed her arms and slouched in her seat, &quot;Not really.&quot; She 
replied, trying hard to keep her irritation with the Head Mistresses 
hidden. 

&quot;You can tell me how you feel.&quot; Sophia assured, &quot;I will not punish you 
for speaking your mind.&quot; 

&quot;Fine then.&quot; Jessica turned in her seat to face the woman, anger in her 
eyes, &quot;This all sucks. I should be able to leave when I want to. I&#39;m an 
adult now and you can&#39;t force me to stay here.&quot; 

&quot;Who said I was forcing you?&quot; Sophia replied calmly. 

&quot;You told me I can&#39;t leave.&quot; Jessica returned, &quot;You said I had to stay 
longer.&quot; 

&quot;That is not my decision.&quot; Sophia remarked, &quot;It is you who choose when 
you leave.&quot; 

&quot;Then I want to go now.&quot; Jessica countered. 

&quot;If that is what you want.&quot; Sophia agreed, &quot;But do you think you are 
truly ready to leave?&quot; She inquired. &quot;Did you not feel a weight lift 
from her heart when I told you to stay longer?&quot;

Jessica shifted in her seat and stared down at her shoes. She knew 
Sophia was right; she wasn&#39;t ready to leave, not now that she found Kris 
and all the others. She really didn&#39;t want to leave, but she didn&#39;t want 
to be forced to stay either. She felt torn between the need to leave 
Whispering Hills and the desire to stay with her friends. 

&quot;You can stay as long as you need.&quot; Sophia stated taking another turn, 
&quot;I personally think you should stay longer, not just for yourself but 
for the other girls, you need each other. We could always use a more 
permanent dorm head, one who understands the girls and can council them 
when needed.  &quot; 

Jessica stared at the Head Mistress in shock. She was certain that 
Sophia would want her out of the school after finding out about her 
actions over the years. Why would she think she would be good for the 
girls? She lowered her head in shame as she recalled all the hurt she 
caused the other members of the dorms, &quot;How could you think that? Most 
of them hate me and I keep causing them so much pain.&quot;

&quot;They would be in pain if you were there or not.&quot; Sophia stated bluntly, 
&quot;Part of healing is living. You might have made some bad decisions in 
life, but you realize they were not the right decisions, am I right?&quot; 

Jessica slowly nodded, pulling the sleeves of the jacket over her hands 
to conceal the trembling that started to overtake her. 

&quot;Would you follow the same path a second time?&quot; 

Jessica shook her head violently; &quot;I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone anymore.&quot; 

Sophia smiled at the girl, &quot;Then I think you will do fine.&quot;
