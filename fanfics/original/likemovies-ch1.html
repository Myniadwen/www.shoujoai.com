<p><strong>Beginning Bonds</strong> <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Kristen!&quot; a loud, annoying voice shouted from the front of   the classroom.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Kristen Sawyer!&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  The girl peeked her head up over her arms, opening an eye. In front   of the class stood a short, middle aged, overweight, bitter Mrs. Kingston.   She was wearing one of her infamous green vests that was disgustingly   tight on her, and pants up to her bellybutton. She always seemed to   'style' her hair to look like a black, and mostly grey bird's nest.   Her thick rimmed glasses, which were always on the brim of her nose,   didn't do her any justice, either.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;It's Kris. I thought we'd already established this.&quot; The   girl replied, a hint of annoyance in her tired tone.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;I don't care! Just stay awake in my class!&quot; Mrs. Kingston   bellowed back.  <br />
  <br />
  Kris waved a hand lazily, and dropped her head back down on the desk,   gaining a wave of snickers from her classmates, and an extremely frustrated   sigh from Mrs. Kingston. She knew that she wouldn't kick her out. She   never did, so Kris always pushed her buttons, along with most of her   other teachers. She's always enjoyed annoying her teachers, and getting   them worked up. It's safe to say that ever since Kris transferred to   Highland All-Girls Academy, she's gotten a lot of attention, may it   be negative or positive. She's had so many visits from the principal,   and guidance councilor that she's lost count. Along with her 'attitude',   the teachers find her looks distracting, especially to the other girls.   Kris' boyish looks and dazzling blue-green eyes were two attributes   that helped her hold the hearts of many girls in the school. Even though   she doesn't try, she's a gentleman at heart, and it shows.  <br />
  <br />
  The school bell rang, signaling the end of Math class. Study Hall next.   Kris yawned and lifted herself off the desk, gathering the scattered   notes and books spread across her desk. &quot;Hey, Kris!&quot; Someone   yelled from outside the classroom door. Kris looked in the direction   of the shouting. Alyson McKenzie. Alyson was one of many girls who were   constantly trying to make Kris her 'Prince'. She was a pretty girl,   sure. She had long dark brown hair, going down to the middle of her   back, chocolate brown eyes, and a flawless complexion. She was about   5'5&quot;, and wore a pleated skirt, a short sleeve dress shirt, knee-high   socks, and had her shirt unbuttoned slightly, showing off her 'perfect'   cleavage. Most would be more than happy to have her as a girlfriend,   but it was much too obvious to Kris that she was just trying to go out   with her for the bragging rights. And, really, she wasn't her 'type'.   Kris got up from her seat, swung her backpack over her shoulder, and   walked towards the classroom door with one hand stuffed in her front   pocket, and the other holding onto the shoulder strap of her backpack.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;How was math?&quot; Alyson asked as Kris approached her. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;It was alright.&quot; She replied dully. She knew that she didn't   care how it was. She just wanted Kris to think she did. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Are we still on for lunch?&quot; She asked as they started down   the long hallway to the Library. <br />
  <br />
  Kris nodded as they walked past flocks of girls standing around, talking   to their friends before the bell rang. Every now and again, a girl would   stop talking, look at Kris, and turn away quickly as she made eye contact,   giggling to their friends about her. How troublesome. Alyson noticed   the gazes and hooked her arm around the taller girl's, clinging to her   hopelessly. Kris let out a soft sigh and continued walking, knowing   that there was no use in fighting any of her attempts. She was persistent.  <br />
  <br />
  They reached the door to the library as the bell sounded once again,   starting the beginning of class. Alyson detached herself from her arm.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Alright, see you at lunch!&quot; She said excitedly, waving quickly   and running off to her class. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;<em>Another late slip for her</em>.&quot; Kris thought as she pushed   open the library doors. She quickly shuffled to the back of the library,   finding a desk in the far corner, where no one seemed to ever go.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;<em>Away from everyone, finally</em>.&quot; <br />
  <br />
  The thought was great. This was the only time Kris had to herself. She   could bury herself into some books, and let loose. Here, she could finally   hide from all the gazes, the giggles, the flirting, the girls who wanted   a piece of her. Here, she could relax. Kris took out her Science textbook   and opened it to page 305. The Atomic Theory. There was a test coming   up soon, and contrary to popular belief, Kris had perfect grades to   keep up. She placed her elbow on the desk, rested her head in her palm,   and read quietly, memorizing facts for the test. As she was turning   the page, Kris' attention was diverted to a young lady across the room,   sitting at a deserted desk piled with books.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;<em>A person, back here?&quot;</em> She thought, looking the other   girl over.  <br />
  <br />
  She was small, probably about 5'2&quot;. She had shoulder-length blonde   hair, black horn-rimmed glasses, so thick you could barely see her eye   color, or her eyes for that matter, which added to Kris' curiosity.   She also had a black scarf around her neck, covering the bottom half   of her face. She wore an oversized blue sweater, and a pleated skirt   with knee-high black socks, one pushed down further than the other.   The girl was reading a thick book that was almost bigger than her head;   Kris couldn't help but smile a little as she pushed her glasses up on   her nose with her index finger. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;<em>How adorable</em>...&quot; Kris thought as she stared at her   for a few more moments.  <br />
  <br />
  Kris forced her gaze to break as she noticed that the girl was beginning   to gather her books. She frowned.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;<em>Leaving already</em>?&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  ****************************** <br />
  <br />
  &quot;STOP!&quot; shouted the young girl, struggling to get away from   the tight grasp on her wrist. <br />
  <br />
  The girl was being held back by an older boy with greasy brown hair,   piercing blue eyes, and he wore baggy clothes that were old, and did   no justice to his overweight form. He held his iron grip on the girl's   wrist tighter, gaining a scream of agony as she struggled more. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Come on now, Cassie. You know you want this just as much as I   do!&quot; The boy replied to her screams with a disgusting smirk painted   on his face that made Cassie's skin crawl.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Get off me, Ryan! Like Hell I want this! You touching me in any   way is completely repulsing!&quot; She screamed back, tears forming   in her eyes as she realized that there was no way for her to get away. <br />
  <br />
  A flash of anger went into the boy's eyes as he quickly used his free   hand to slap the small blonde haired girl in the face. The force of   the blow sent her head swinging to the side, and the tears glistening   in her eyes fell as his hand made contact to her cheek. She hung her   head, her cheek burning from the boy's assault and sobbed quietly, hoping   he would change his mind, and let her go. She knew he wouldn't.  <br />
  <br />
  Cassie finally gave up and closed her eyes, blocking out the image of   the boy in front of her, her own crying drowning out the sound of him   yelling.  <br />
  <br />
  ********************************** <br />
  <br />
  The next week went uneventful. In her curiosity, Kris attempted to find   out more about the girl she had seen in the library but only a few days   ago. She asked around, even opting to ask the faculty… But no one   had seen, or even heard of the mystery girl. Every chance she got, Kris   went to the library; to the same area where she had seen her. But no   luck. She wasn't there. It was Friday, last period, and Kris has had   enough. She sighed and walked along the long hallways of her school,   deciding to skip her last class, Home Ec. Nothing could be heard but   the tapping of her worn black and white Converse against the freshly   waxed floors. She felt strangely at ease, listening to only the sound   of her shoes against the ceramic flooring.                    </p>
<p>                                ************************************ <br />
  <br />
  A young boy ran along a straight dirt road in the middle of the woods,   far from civilization, wearing only shorts, a t-shirt, and some worn   out sneakers.  His labored breath was coming in short gasps as he ran   faster along the path, keeping his head high, and shoulders back. His   concentration was focused completely on running; putting one foot in   front of the other. He was so focused on his task, that he didn't hear   the muffled screams that were illuminating the night from a short distance.   He kept a steady pace, sweat dripping off the ends of his short black   hair, and running down his face. As he was running along, not breaking   the fast pace he had set, a louder screech broke through the moderate   silence. He  came to an abrupt stop, almost falling over in the process.   He jerked his head to the side, where the scream emanated. He started   running in the direction of the scream, even faster than before, fueled   by a fear of what he might find. He was ducking, and jumping, dodging   tree branches, rocks, stumps, and anything else that got in his way.   Another scream was heard, this time it was much closer. He slowed down   slightly as he neared the origin of these noises. He stopped as he came   upon a clearing, and hid himself in the bushes. In the middle of the   clearing there was a boy, and a girl. The boy was much bigger, and obviously   older than the small blonde girl. The blonde's shirt was ripped open,   and her small breasts were visible. She was crying. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Shut the fuck up!&quot; The boy snarled. &quot;No one is going   to fucking save you, you stupid slut.&quot; <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Please… Just leave me alone, Ryan…&quot; She pleaded to him   between sobs.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Why the hell would I do that? Sluts like you deserve this.&quot;   He replied as he threw her down onto the ground, and unzipped his pants.  <br />
  <br />
  The boy hiding in the bushes gasped as he realized what was going on.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Fuck!&quot; He whispered under his breath. &quot;I have to do   something… But what?&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Ryan pulled out his hard member out of his boxers and grinned down at   the girl he had forced to the ground. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;You're going to be a good whore, and do whatever I say, you hear?&quot;   He said, no hint of remorse in his voice at all.  <br />
  <br />
  Seeing that this would be his only chance to save the girl, the boy   ran out of the bushes, startling the older boy.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;I wouldn't do that, if I were you.&quot; He said. His voice was   calm, and held an edge to it. He showed none of the fear that he was   feeling. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;The fuck did you just say?&quot; The older boy growled, pulling   up his pants in the process. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;You heard me. If you even touch her,&quot; he replied, nodding   towards the girl on the ground, &quot;then you will be really sorry.&quot; <br />
  <br />
  &quot;And what are <em>you</em> supposed to do about that, huh? A little   fucking twerp like you. You think you can actually hurt me?&quot; He   laughed and zipped his pants up, obviously unimpressed by the smaller   boy's threats.&quot;I think I can do more than you think.&quot; He replied,   smirking.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Try me, fag!&quot; The older boy shouted back as he threw a punch   at the younger one. <br />
  <br />
  The boy quickly dodged the punch, and threw one of his own, hitting   the other boy in the stomach. The hit threw the larger boy off, causing   him to let out a loud grunt and stumble back to regain his composure. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;You…&quot; He started, swinging at the boy full force once again,   this time managing to connect with the smaller boy's jaw, throwing him   back onto the ground with a loud thump.  <br />
  <br />
  The smaller boy struggled slightly to sit up, and wiped the trail of   blood that was coming out of his mouth with the back of his hand. He   then grinned, and stood up. He walked calmly over to the larger boy,   kicking him in the groin with all of his might, before he even had a   chance to react. Within moments the larger boy was on the ground, cupping   his manhood in his hands and crying out in agony. The smaller boy chuckled   softly and walked over to the girl who was still laying on the ground,   stunned and exposed. He reached out his hand, looking down at her with   a warm, inviting smile. His hair was drenched in sweat, and plastered   across his forehead, but he couldn't have looked any better. The girl   stared into his handsome blue-green eyes in awe before she took his   hand and pulled herself up.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;I… Thank… Thank you..&quot; She stuttered, barely managing   to get out those few words. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Don't mention it. It was my pleasure… I couldn't let him just   do that to you.&quot; He replied gently, not wanting to startle the   already shaken up girl.  <br />
  <br />
  The girl smiled lightly and looked down at herself, upon realizing her   exposed chest she quickly wrapped her arms around her chest and blushed   a dark shade of red. This reaction made the boy in front of her chuckle.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Come on… Lets get out of here before he recovers.&quot; He said. <br />
  <br />
  The girl nodded. &quot;Oh… I'm Cassie, by the way.&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Kris.&quot; The boy replied plainly, as they ran out through the   path he had made earlier. <br />
  <br />
  Upon reaching the safety of the dirt trail, they both stopped to catch   their breaths. Cassie subtly glanced over at the boy who had saved her.   He was pretty short, and not very muscular, for a boy. The sweat on   his face gleamed in the moonlight, illuminating his face.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;<em>So handsome…&quot; </em>Cassie thought as she watched him   wipe the sweat off his forehead.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;So, where do you live?&quot; He asked, startling Cassie.  <br />
  &quot;Huh? Oh… Um. Fairview Lane…&quot; She replied, slightly flustered. <br />
  <br />
  Kris raised an eyebrow and chuckled at how the girl was acting. &quot;Oh?   I live two blocks from there… I'll walk you home.&quot; He said, he   eyed her ripped shirt and nodded towards her &quot;But… You can't   go home like that…&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Cassie blushed once again, forgetting her state of undress. &quot;Oh…   Right… Uh. I don't have anything to wear…&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Kris stood there for a moment, thinking. &quot;I'll give you my shirt.&quot;   He said, then started lifting off the plain navy t-shirt he was wearing.   Cassie blushed even deeper, unable to keep her eyes off of his body.   She watched tentatively as his stomach was slowly exposed. He had a   flat stomach, and his abs were visible, glistening in the moonlight   from sweating. She gulped, and waited for him to completely remove the   article of clothing. It felt like hours. She squeezed her eyes closed   tight for a moment, then opened them. His shirt was off, and he was   holding it out to her. Cassie gasped in shock at what she saw. In place   of the bare, flat chest that Cassie was expecting, there was a small,   white sports bra.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;You… You're a girl?!&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  *********************************** <br />
  <br />
  Flocks of girls filled the hallways of Highland All-Girls Academy as   the last bell of the day sounded, signaling everyone to go home for   the weekend. Kris could hardly hear herself think as everyone shouted   above the noise, making even more noise. She pushed her way through   the crowd, ignoring the waves and greetings she received on the way   to her locker. Kris quickly spun the dial on the combination lock. Right   36... Left 14... Right 39... Click. After removing the lock she quickly   shoved any books, and papers that were in her hand, into the top compartment   of her locker, and grabbed her black leather jacket. The leather was   worn out from years of owning it, and fit Kris' athletic form snugly.   She slipped it on over her arms and zipped it up half way. Kris was   about to close her locker door when she noticed a small piece of paper   lodged between some of her books, and the side of the locker. Out of   curiosity, Kris took it out and slipped it into her pocket, opting to   read it when she had some time, and privacy. She glanced up at a small   digital clock on the wall above her.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Shit!&quot; Kris muttered angrily. &quot;Going to miss the fucking   bus!&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  The bus would leave any minute now, and she wasn't really in the mood   for an hour long walk home. She closed and locked the locker and ran   past the swarm of girls still left in the school, waving to some of   the ones who called to her on the way out.  <br />
  <br />
  Kris reached the bus just as it was about to leave, out of breath she   smiled nervously and apologized to the bus driver for being late, then   took the only empty seat. She was glad that everyone else had already   taken their seats, and were chatting away to their friends. The bus   started rolling, and Kris gazed out the window, ready for the long ride   home. It moved a few meters forward before coming to an abrupt stop,   launching her forward slightly. She looked up at the front of the bus,   raising an eyebrow. The bus driver was opening the sliding door. Kris   groaned and slid down into her seat. Whoever it was getting on, would   have to sit with her.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;So much for a torment-free ride home.&quot; Kris muttered under   her breath.  <br />
  <br />
  Slightly curious to see who it was boarding the bus, Kris sat up straight   again and locked her eyes onto the front of the bus, once again. A blonde   head slowly emerged from behind the front seats. A small girl with glasses,   and a black scarf around her neck stood in the narrow hallway of the   bus, apologizing to the bus driver with a blush on her face. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;<em>The girl from the library!&quot;</em> Kris thought, her excitement   rising along with a sudden flash of nervousness.  <br />
  <br />
  After making a lengthy apology for being late, the blonde turned towards   the seats, scanning through to find an empty spot. Kris raised her hand   to get the girl's attention. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Hey there, this is probably the only free seat, so you'll have   to be stuck with me.&quot; Kris shouted out to her over the noise, giving   the other girl a smirk.  <br />
  <br />
  The girl blushed a little more and nodded towards Kris, slowly making   her way back to her seat. Kris scooted in to give the girl more room.   She took off her backpack, and sat down next to Kris timidly with her   backpack sitting on her lap.  <br />
  <br />
  The bus started up once again, and they set off to their destinations.   Besides the hustle and bustle of chattering girls around them, there   was a complete silence, between Kris, and the mystery girl.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;I'm Kris.&quot; Kris said, attempting to break the awkwardness   that hung in the air.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;I'm Melanie...&quot; The girl replied, looking over at the taller   girl slightly. <br />
  <br />
  Her voice was almost a whisper, and Kris strained to hear her. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;That's a nice name.&quot; The raven haired-girl replied, smiling   at her. <br />
  <br />
  Melanie blushed deeper and smiled, at least from what Kris could tell,   since Melanie's scarf was blocking her view of her lips.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Th-thank you...&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;So, are you new here? I haven't seen you around school before,   and I know I wouldn't have forgotten someone as adorable as yourself.&quot;   Kris said after a moment of silence between them, choosing to ignore   the other girl's obvious discomfort. <br />
  <br />
  Melanie nodded her head, her eyes fixed on her backpack.  &quot;Yeah…   My family just moved here from a small town a few hours away.&quot; <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Oh, I see. Where do you live?&quot; Kris asked, glad that the   awkward silence between them was finally letting up.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Um… 18 Madison Place.&quot; She replied after a short pause.  <br />
  <br />
  Kris' eyes lit up upon hearing the street name.  &quot;I live in 17 Madison   Place!&quot; She replied excitedly . A large smile was forming on her   face. Like a kid in a candy shop. <br />
  <br />
  Melanie finally broke the gaze she had on her backpack and looked up   at the taller girl. &quot;Really?&quot; She asked, sounding slightly   excited herself. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Yep!&quot; Kris replied, nodding her head. &quot;Maybe we can   walk to and from the bus stop together, since we live so close together?   It only makes sense.&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Melanie glanced around nervously, and after a moment finally nodded.   &quot;Sure… I mean… If you want to… I wouldn't want you to go   out of your way for me…&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Kris let out a chuckle and shook her head. &quot;Of course I want to,   silly. That's why I asked. I'll come get you at 7:30 tomorrow morning?&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  A look of panic lit up the girl's face as she quickly looked away. &quot;U-um…   N-no. How about I come get you, instead?&quot; She replied in a low,   nervous voice. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Um… Okay.&quot; Kris agreed. She was confused by the girl's   sudden actions, but decided to leave it at that.  <br />
  <br />
  Melanie let out a held breath and seemed to relax a little more.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Thank you…&quot; She whispered. </p>
