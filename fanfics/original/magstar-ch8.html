<h1>Magic Star Warriors: The Dark Force Era (part 8 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/magstar-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>As the newly transformed demon entity that was once Tanzanite inched 
his way towards the starsoldiers with an unmistakable positive ness, 
Lovestar felt a cold sense of dread pervade her body. The Dark aura 
around his maddeningly powerful body was the most intense and the most 
powerful she had ever felt. Waterstar turned to Lovestar as she saw 
the chestnut haired warrior slowly backing away. In a shot she was by 
her side, however, she keeping one eye locked on Tanzanite. 

&#147;Are you alright Lovestar?&#148; she asked concerned, and her concern grew 
when she saw the Lovestar&#146;s gaze had never left Demon-Tanzanite, and 
that her arms where shaking in cold fear&#133;

&#147;Lovestar are you okay&#133; are you okay&#133; Lovestar!&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

Lovestar faced Waterstar abruptly when her sharp plea snapped her out 
of her reverie. The chestnut haired girl winced at Waterstar&#146;s face, 
full of concern. She had to be strong. She couldn&#146;t let the Goddess of 
the sea know she was afraid. Without hesitation, Lovestar let out a 
challenging smile and tensed her muscles to control her shaking.  

&#147;I&#146;m okay Waterstar. Lets just take care of this and then we can go 
home.&#148;

Waterstar sighed and smiled back.

&#147;Right.&#148;

Waterstar and Lovestar then moved up to Sunstar and stood, as the Dark 
general&#146;s slow pace came to a stop. He smiled, his features and 
disposition, reeking with arrogant delight.

&#147;You foolish, ignorant worms&#133; do you realize who I am? What I am? I 
have become a being, which transcends any level of power that any of 
you weaklings could ever hope to aspire to. I have become a god 
incarnate&#133; nothing on this earth can stop me now&#133;&#148;

Firestar stepped forward boldly, with that same unwavering confidence 
she had against Gargantua.

&#147;Ha. You&#146;re nothing but a parasitic leech. Feeding off of the misery 
and suffering of others. You and your whole race disgust me. I am 
Firestar, the Goddess of the flame! I am going to smash you into 
fragments so small nothing could identify them!&#148;

Demon-Tanzanite merely smiled and stood, mockingly calm. 

&#147;Tough words for such a puny little girl. Didn&#146;t your mother ever 
teach not to bite off more than you can chew?&#148;

Firestar&#146;s eyes widened significantly, and Earthstar saw the pain in 
her eyes as she realized how deep that cut. The redheaded girl 
clenched her fists as the comment bit into her.

&#147;Why you son of a &#133;&#148;

&#147;Look, I don&#146;t have time to waste toying with you. Once I destroy you 
five, I&#146;ll continue my search for the other two Talismans. Then I will 
return to the Deadstar as the hero of her majesty, and the earth will 
be ours!!&#148;

&#147;No! We wont let that happen!&#148; Earthstar shouted. &#147;The earth is no 
ones property! You will not enslave humanity in the name of your sick 
little game!&#148; 

&#147;Yes. We wont let you do this! We will stop you!&#148; Sunstar added.

Suddenly Earthstar turned around and looked sternly at the other three 
starsoldiers.

&#147;You three will stay out of this!&#148; Earthstar said coldly.

&#147;What are you saying? You can&#146;t beat him alone!&#148; Waterstar argued.

&#147;We wont allow weaklings like you to get in the way, stand aside!&#148; 
Earthstar yelled.

&#147;Oh ho! Trouble in the ranks?&#148; Tanzanite joked.

&#147;Shut up!&#148;  Earthstar looked back across to her partner and smiled.

&#147;Ready?&#148;

&#147;&#133; Ready.&#148; The fire soldier replied. 

Earthstar looked back at Demon-Tanzanite, and frowned. She tightly 
clutched her fists and spread her legs in the star cross formation. 
Firestar crouched down, raised her left fist to her face. The 
fingertips of her right hand gently touched the floor in the dragon 
lotus position. Without warning and in pure anger, Earthstar yelled 
out,

&#147;Dragon Lotus star formation!!&#148; 

In a burst of adrenalin, Firestar surged forward with a furious haste, 
launching herself at the arrogant dark-general. As she ran forwards, 
towards him, she crouched again, and powered herself off the ground 
and she leapt into the air with unyielding velocity. Whilst in 
mid-air, the Goddess of flame body-flipped gracefully, and landed 
quickly behind the Demon-Tanzanite. He himself smiled, as he kept his 
eye traced on her every movement.  Firestar stood quickly then charged 
again, this time yelling in fury. Immediately she swung a fist at the 
dark general, but almost instantly, the Demon blocked it with his 
right arm. The flame goddess did not hesitate however, and hastily 
swung her left fist at him. Nevertheless he ducked under it with 
remarkable speed and countered with a sharp rising uppercut. The force 
of the blow flung Firestar back a few meters, so she smashed her arm 
into the ground, using it to propel herself into stability, and swung 
around on the arm, landing in another crouching position. Undauntedly, 
Firestar again charged at him, slid to the ground quickly, and swept 
at the dark-general&#146;s ankles with her right leg. The Demon slightly 
hopped into the air above the kick and landed as Firestar swung around 
again, stood and tried to punch him. Tanzanite blocked the straight 
with both arms, and leaned backwards to avoid the retaliating 
roundhouse kick from Firestar. His limber, and smooth body leaned 
backwards enough for Tanzanite&#146;s arms to reach the floor. And use them 
as balance to power the rest of his body off of the floor and into the 
air. Skillfully and powerfully, Firestar was struck by a well-executed 
and violent somersault kick, and hurled backwards. This time though, 
Tanzanite gave her no chance to recover, and as soon as he got on his 
feet, the Demon rushed towards Firestar and heavily kicked her in the 
stomach. Tanzanite rose and laughed as his crimson blood eyes watched 
Firestar lying on the grass, helpless.

&#147;Heh, heh&#133; just a human.&#148;

The Demon quickly raised his fist into the air.

&#147;&#133; And no human is a match for me.&#148;

The burly fist of the Dark general was about to come crashing down on 
the Goddess of flame, until he realized Earthstar hadn&#146;t attacked him 
yet. His fist slowed to a halt and his blood red eyes searched around 
for her. Soon enough the Demon&#146;s eyes observed Earthstar, gathering 
energy into her fist and using the other hand to air-smooth the 
energy. Her eyes were shut tightly as she gathered secret energies 
from within her, in preparation for the attack to follow. She quickly 
felt a ping, indicating the readiness of the attack. Her eyes opened, 
and she pulled her fist back behind her, and ran towards the dark 
general. Earthstar needed the proximity of attack and lunged at 
Tanzanite, her dark and heavy bangs blowing in the breeze as she 
moved. The haughty dark general however, had no qualms about letting 
the dark haired girl&#146;s attack hit him, and strutted up indignantly, 
daring her to attack. With lion like agility and quickness, Earthstar 
directed her energy charged fist in straight-like fashion, into the 
stomach of Demon-Tanzanite. 

&#147;Comet Fist!!&#148;

Lovestar, Waterstar and Sunstar were shaking as the shockwaves of the 
attack rippled through the air, whipping up dirt and dust, and blowing 
off branches from trees. Earthstar, with her fist still driven into 
his stomach, looked up, only to have Demon-Tanzanite gaze down at her, 
and smile amusedly. 

&#147;You&#146;ll have to do better than that girlie&#133;&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148;

Earthstar looked back down the point, which had been hit by her Comet 
fist, only to see that that area had been totally untarnished.  Then 
the Violet eyed girl saw nothing but a flash of jet black as 
Tanzanite&#146;s iron fist slapped her away as though she were nothing. The 
cool, calm Demon-Tanzanite walked over to Earthstar, and inspected 
her. 

&#147;Stupid starsoldier. Weren&#146;t you the one who told me you could 
dismember me? I have a good idea, why don&#146;t I dismember you? Yes! A 
capital plan. I tear you limb from limb, and feed your remains to 
those other little human dogs.&#148;

Earthstar looked up at him with pure disgust.

&#147;You make me sick&#133;&#148;

&#147;Oh, ho, ho, ho, I&#146;m going to enjoy killing you&#133;huh?&#148;

Demon-Tanzanite turned around quickly as he saw the other three 
starsoldiers watching this. He smiled raggedly as he saw the fear in 
their eyes. 

&#147;Scared girls? Oh don&#146;t worry everyone gets a turn. Ha, ha, ha, ha, 
ha!&#148;

Waterstar looked upon the dark-general with a building rage, as 
Earthstar yelled out in pain, when Tanzanite repeatedly kicked her in 
the stomach. Again, and again and again. The earth Goddess&#146;s cries 
filled the park, and echoed into the dark distance, merging with the 
laughing of the tyrannical instigator of the pain. Lovestar felt 
screams of Earthstar ring in her ears, and felt her inner will to end 
this over-power her, no matter what Earthstar&#146;s wishes were. Without 
thought or order, Lovestar tried to run to Earthstar&#146;s torturer, but 
was held fast by Sunstar&#146;s unshakable grip, latched on to her wrist. 

&#147;Sunstar! Let me go I need to help her!&#148;

&#147;No. Not yet&#133;just wait&#133;&#148;

&#147;Wait? For what? For Earthstar&#146;s ribs to get kicked in?&#148;

Sunstar didn&#146;t say anything, only held her wrist steady and looked on 
at Earthstar and Demon-Tanzanite. She couldn&#146;t stand any of this 
either but they had to wait. Earthstar&#146;s cries still tore out from her 
throat, and the violet haired girl started coughing up dark blotches 
of scarlet blood onto the cold, green grass. However watching over 
this was Firestar, shaking with anger. She clutched her arms together 
and pressed out her palms, eyes tightly closed, twitching from 
concentration, gathering the power of the flame of her soul. It was 
extremely difficult to concentrate with the screams of her best friend 
surrounding her, but nothing would stop her from destroying 
Demon-Tanzanite. Firestar tensed every tendon in her body as she felt 
the energy of the attack complete itself. An evil grin passed along 
Firestar&#146;s face as she watched Tanzanite, who had just spotted her. 

&#147;Take this you Neanderthal pile of crap&#133; Shooting Fireball Strike!!!&#148; 

As soon as she spoke those words, a vortex of flame erupted around the 
red haired warriors wrists, and instantly, multiple waves of small 
fireballs launched out of the vortex, towards Tanzanite. The demon 
himself finished kicking Earthstar with one final boot, and moved 
towards the energy blasts. Each fireball hit the demon and a fiery 
explosion broke out around him, burning everything as the flames of 
spirit fire engulfed him. Smoke wafted across the cold wet grass; the 
patch blasted by the shooting fireball strike now charred black. 
Earthstar, Waterstar, Lovestar, Sunstar and Firestar all looked on in 
doubtful anticipation to see if Demon-Tanzanite had survived, and to 
their great regret, the diabolical demon had emerged unscathed. 
Firestar&#146;s jaw dropped in confusion as Demon-Tanzanite&#146;s body had not 
a scratch on it, still gleaming with dark energy.

&#147;Heh, heh, heh&#133; not bad kid. Not bad at all&#133;&#148;

The dark grin of Tanzanite beamed evilly, as he screamed loudly and 
charged at Firestar. The Goddess of flame prepared herself as the 
demon flung his fist straight at her. Swiftly though, Earthstar (much 
to Firestar&#146;s surprise) swung around in front of Firestar and caught 
Tanzanite&#146;s punch with both arms. The force of the blow, whether she 
smothered it of not, was enough to push her back a few feet, however 
using all of her Un-natural super strength, Earthstar grabbed 
Tanzanite&#146;s arm even tighter, swiveled around on the spot, yanked his 
arm, and brought him over her shoulder, smashing the lizard like 
mammoth into the ground, shocking Waterstar and Lovestar who were 
watching this with amazement. Abruptly, Tanzanite felt heavily banged 
Earthstar jump into his chest, and heard her roar with anger as she 
laid waste to him with a flurry of hi-powered punches. Each punch 
repeatedly smashed into the black sternum of Tanzanite, and the rocks 
below his mighty torso shattered as the earth caved in below the 
relentless pressure of Earthstar&#146;s fists. The violet-eyed girl yelled 
madly, as sweat glistened across her tense and angry face, each blow 
taking its toll on the supply of energy within her, nonetheless she 
continued with an aggressive rhythm. One final punch drove Tanzanite&#146;s 
body deeper down into the creator of soil, and Earthstar raised the 
other hand, pulled it behind her swiftly, gathering more power, power 
she didn&#146;t have to waste.

&#147;Comet Fist!!!&#148;

Earthstar yelled out her attack and hammered her fist straight into 
the chest of Demon-Tanzanite. Earthstar leapt out of the ditch as the 
shockwave of the attack rocked the cold grass floor of the park. The 
earth goddess landed a few meters away, and collapsed to her knees as 
she fell tired.  She panted rapidly and shallowly, sweat tracing down 
the frames of her face. Firestar looked over to the creator but held 
fast defensively as the demon rose, however, this time, the demon did 
not come out unscathed&#133; Tanzanite frowned confusedly and clasped his 
chest, to find it bleeding&#133; As he raised his hand to his eyes and 
glared at the haunting sight of his own blood, Tanzanite&#146;s rage 
started to bubble over and escalate. Not to be out done, the Demon 
fired an energy blast at Earthstar, the shattering force of the blast 
propelled her into the air and she landed hard on the ground, as a 
yelp of pain had been emitted from her throat.

&#147;Damn You!&#148; Firestar yelled aloud as she charged forward.

Firestar tried to punch the demon, but his resourcefulness and cunning 
allowed him to block each attack thrown at him. Firestar felt herself 
lose all control as frustration took over, and she unleashed a flurry 
of combination attacks at the demon. They were sloppy and 
uncoordinated, and Tanzanite laughed in between dodges, at the way 
human sentiment can pull you right off your game, but this only made 
Firestar angrier. The redhead hurled punches, kicks and elbow strikes 
at him, all of which were blocked with minimal effort. One last jab 
aimed at Demon-Tanzanite&#146;s head was dodged, and just as Firestar flung 
a fist at him again, the demon quickly caught it and with all his god 
like might, crunched her hand in a radical death grip. Firestar 
shrieked in agony as Demon-Tanzanite crushed the fragile bones of her 
fist. The once proud and somewhat overbearing Firestar, was now 
helpless as she fell to one knee, aware of nothing but the pain&#133; 
Earthstar, now tired and dazed, struggled to her feet, as she heard 
her best friend&#146;s cries of pain, driven only by a blinding hatred, 
reflected in her dark violet eyes&#133; rage had taken the place of 
strength and was the only thing keeping her from passing out of 
exhaustion&#133; the will to see this freak die&#133; Recklessly she dashed 
towards her companion, and as soon as she reached the two of them, she 
missile dropkicked him in the back, knocking him over, and releasing 
Firestar from his grip. The red headed girl, always one to take up the 
challenge, didn&#146;t stop there, and charged up another attack. From 
clutched palms a new vortex opened.

&#147;Shooting Fireball Strike!!!&#148;

A massive flame ball engulfed the demon in fire, the fire exploded, 
and Firestar and Earthstar covered their faces as a wave of smoke 
billowed over the grass. As the explosion subsided, Firestar walked 
over to the creator created by the blast. Nothing but smoke. Firestar 
allowed herself to pant lightly as she called out to Earthstar.

&#147;I&#133;I&#133;I think I got him.&#148; She said breathlessly.

&#147;Are you sure&#133; huh?&#148;

Shock and panic ran through Earthstar&#146;s bones at that point. A 
chilling sense of dread enveloped her.

&#147;Firestar! Get away from the pit!!&#148;

Firestar shot a confused look at the violet-eyed starsoldier, but 
turned her head slowly back to the ditch, as she felt an energy signal 
still emanating from the smoke. Suddenly a thin, sharp beam of dark 
energy, similar to Sunstar&#146;s Shining Sunset Beam shot out from the 
smoke and pierced Firestar&#146;s abdomen. A geyser of blood splurged out 
of the small of her back, as the beam cut through her torso.  Firestar 
felt her blood run cold as she felt things go black. Felt things sink 
deep into a cold darkness&#133; a place of isolation&#133; a place without 
Krista&#133; Firestar&#146;s body fell backwards and landed crudely on the icy 
grass. Earthstar&#146;s eyes widened significantly, as she watched her 
fallen comrade, best friend, lying in awkward heap&#133;the very sight of 
this caused&#133; despair to fill her heart&#133; almost without thinking, 
Earthstar ran, clumsily, stumbling at each turn&#133; it didn&#146;t matter 
which way it happened&#133; what happened to her&#133; all she wanted to do was 
reach Firestar&#133; she couldn&#146;t let her go&#133; not her&#133; as Earthstar ran, a 
shifty vision blurred in front of her, materializing into the dark 
demon Tanzanite. Earthstar didn&#146;t ever register his appearance, not 
until she felt his large fist smash into her already bruised ribs. The 
violet eyed starsoldier begun to choke on her own blood, with nothing 
on her mind but Firestar&#133; and the alarming pool of blood surrounding 
her&#133; 

The mocking smile on the face of the Demon-Tanzanite widened as new 
thoughts bloomed in his head. He sharply grabbed the face of 
Earthstar, and pulled her up, her limbs dangling in the air, left 
lifeless from the shock of seeing Firestar in that state. He directed 
her head so that she faced Firestar, and laughed at her, in her 
helpless situation. 

&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!! This is so sickeningly delicious! How does 
it feel? Knowing you friend over there is a lost cause, that you are 
powerless to stop me? That your weaknesses and stupidity has cost you 
not only your life, but also hers&#133; she&#146;ll bleed to death soon&#133; how 
does it feel? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!&#148;

&#147;Crystal Frozen Fraction!!!&#148;

Tanzanite let out a strangled grunt of shock when Waterstar&#146;s energy 
attack hammered into him, so much so that Tanzanite let go of 
Earthstar, and just managed to maintain some form of balance. 
Earthstar snapped out of her reverie, and looked confusedly towards 
Waterstar and Lovestar, who had leapt down in front of her, facing 
Demon-Tanzanite. 

Lovestar looked back at Earthstar and nodded over to Firestar.

&#147;Go and take care of her!&#148;

&#147;We can handle this guy.&#148; Waterstar said, keeping her eyes on the 
demon.

Earthstar remembered Firestar&#146;s injuries and turned around so 
abruptly, she barely noticed that Sunstar had already gone over there 
to inspect Firestar&#146;s wound. Earthstar fumbled to her feet, and ran to 
her partner&#146;s side. As she reached the pony-tailed redhead, Earthstar 
kneeled down beside her and gently stroked the bangs from her 
Firestar&#146;s pale face. 

&#147;Oh god, Firestar&#133; this is my fault&#133; please be okay&#133;please&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Do not worry. She will be fine. Her injury is very deep and she has 
lost a lot of blood, but she will be okay. Her powers will see to 
that.&#148; Sunstar said to Earthstar, reassuringly. 

Earthstar looked towards the ground awkwardly, almost ashamed&#133;

&#147;Why&#133;why are you helping us&#133;?&#148; She asked blankly.

Sunstar didn&#146;t look at Earthstar, but pulled Firestar&#146;s uniform up, 
and wrapped a bandage around her wound, which was now a shadowy red, 
to prevent it from continuing to bleed. 

&#147;Because we are not enemies.&#148;  Sunstar said.

Demon-Tanzanite had become intrigued with these new revelations.

&#147;So&#133; you too wish to join the fray&#133; I would have thought that you 
three would be smart enough to know that any attempt to destroy me 
would be futile in the long run.&#148;

&#147;Well, people tell me I&#146;m a slow learner.&#148; Waterstar remarked.

Demon-Tanzanite snorted. &#147;You would dare mock me?&#148;

&#147;We would dare to stop you. You can&#146;t get away with this!&#148; Lovestar 
said.

Tanzanite smirked, but before he could begin his attack, Waterstar ran 
towards him, building a powerful level of speed, and at the peak of 
her run, launched into the air, and with lightning-like quickness, 
impaled Demon-Tanzanite with her &#145;Dashing spear&#146; attack. The force of 
the kick hurled the demon away, as Waterstar gracefully landed on wet 
cold grass. Lovestar, fresh with strength, leapt into the air. 
Monitoring Demon- Tanzanite with a keen eye in the air, Lovestar began 
to charge and glisten with golden energies, and after a few seconds&#133;

&#147;Crushing Love Blast!!!&#148;

A golden wave of shining energy headed towards Demon-Tanzanite, and 
crashed into him with immense force, driving him deep into the earth. 
Quickly Lovestar lands, next to her companion Waterstar, to have her 
fire another one of her attacks.

&#147;Crystal Frozen Fraction!!!&#148;

The swirling orb of pure blue energy flew across the ground, and 
ploughed into the cloud of dust and smoke, creating another explosion. 

Still by Firestar&#146;s side, Earthstar was gently stroking her ruffled 
hair, holding onto her left hand, still worried&#133; Sunstar watched the 
two of them. They were a lot closer than they first appeared to be&#133;as 
if all they had were each other&#133; Then the sound of an explosion rocked 
her ears and she looked back to the battle. Waterstar and Lovestar 
wouldn&#146;t last long on their own.

&#147;Earthstar.&#148; Sunstar said.

&#147;&#133;Huh&#133; what is it&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Firestar will be fine. Go help them.&#148;

&#147;But&#133;&#148; She felt uneasy about leaving Firestar alone.

&#147;Go help them. Don&#146;t worry I wont let anything happen to her. I 
promise.  Now go help them.&#148;

The violet-eyed girl nodded. &#147;Alright.&#148;

Earthstar took one last look at Firestar, and then quickly ran over to 
the battlefield. As she ran, she felt a new energy fill her, one of 
pure rage, and revenge&#133; the same power which had consumed her since 
the death of her father, but if this rush would aid her in killing 
this demonic un-living, then she would gladly use it&#133;

Earthstar charged up energy into fist again, and ran past Lovestar and 
Waterstar straight towards the cloud of smoke created by the explosion 
of their attacks. Demon-Tanzanite stepped out of the creator in a 
groggy state, a little dazed but relatively okay. The demon barely had 
time to adjust, before Earthstar rammed him down across the pit, and 
onto the cold grass behind it. The rage filled Violet eyed starsoldier 
drew back her energy charged fist once again, gathering more power for 
the attack.

&#147;This is for Firestar you damn monster&#133;&#148;

&#147;Comet Fist!!!!&#148;

Demon-Tanzanite mouth opened widely as he felt Earthstar&#146;s fist drive 
into his body again, this time more powerful, and the shockwave did 
affect him, pushing him into the dirt again. Waterstar looked towards 
Lovestar and smiled. A grin surfaced on Lovestar&#146;s face, and nodded. 
Waterstar quickly stood close behind Lovestar, so much so that the 
Goddess of love and peace started to blush. The chestnut haired girl 
looked back at Waterstar out of the corner of her eye, and quietly 
whispered to her.

&#147;I think I like this position Waterstar&#133;&#148;

Waterstar seemed angry.

&#147;Concentrate Lovestar! I wanna use the move we worked on. Now focus on 
merging our attacks.&#148; 

&#147;Fine, fine.&#148;

They both closed their yes and Waterstar stretched out her arms in 
front of Lovestar. Lovestar also raised her arms and outstretched 
them, just below Waterstar&#146;s, and they both clutched their palms 
together. 

&#147;Ready Lovestar&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Ready!&#148;

&#147;Crystal&#133;&#148; Waterstar said.

&#147;Love&#133;&#148; Lovestar continued,

&#147;Buster!!!&#148; They said in unison.

A massive wave of golden energy edged in blue energy, with streaks of 
electricity passing over it, shot out of the palms of Waterstar and 
Lovestar at lightning speed towards Tanzanite. Earthstar quickly 
jumped out of the way as the blast neared her. As the demon caught 
sight and sense of the attack, he actually felt fear fuse inside of 
him, as he failed to put up a suitable defense to block it. As it hit 
him, a large explosion incurred, and filled the park in gold and blue 
light. Earthstar, Waterstar and Lovestar, covered their eyes as the 
explosion conjured up winds of dirt dust and smoke. And the three then 
heard Demon Tanzanite&#146;s petty screams of pain.  Waterstar and Lovestar 
panted gently as they watched the flames of the attack Lovestar looked 
back at Waterstar, who seemed just as drained as she was.

&#147;Nice idea to combine our powers Waterstar.&#148;

&#147;Yeah&#133; I thought it would have a good effect. Are you okay?&#148;

&#147;Yeah I&#146;m fine I just thought that&#133;&#148;

Lovestar cut herself off when she saw Earthstar giving she and 
Waterstar some very confused looks. The two sweat-dropped and backed 
away from each other.

Waterstar&#146;s hand scratched the back of her head and she giggled 
nervously.

&#147;Heh, heh, heh, heh&#133; We&#146;re just working on a new technique&#133; and&#133; we&#133; 
well um&#133; heh, heh!&#148;

Earthstar still looked at the two of them oddly, but dismissed it just 
the same. The three then turned back to the wide patch of roasted 
grass, covered in a veil of smoke and dust. The second the silhouette 
of the Dark general appeared in the smoke, the starsoldiers heard a 
cry of frustration. As the demon stepped forward, Lovestar, Waterstar 
and Earthstar were shocked to see the amount of damage done to him. 
The demon&#146;s head was the first noticeable difference, since a chunk of 
it was missing; half of his brain, jaw and cheekbone were absolutely 
gone. The side of his body was burned away right down to his ribs, so 
his arm and most of his shoulder blade were nowhere in sight. His body 
was burned and bloodied, and the slick red liquid drained in a large 
pool on the ground. Demon-Tanzanite suddenly coughed up masses of 
blood, and fell to one knee. Waterstar and Earthstar seemed to be 
pleased with effect of the attack, but Lovestar was a little more 
freaked out.

&#147;Whoa! That is gross! And how the hell is he still alive after we blew 
his brains out?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s okay Lovestar. This guy is on his last legs and he knows it.&#148; 
Waterstar added.

&#147;Wrong girl. You will not kill me. In fact you haven&#146;t even seen the 
beginning of my power! The true depth of a Darkforce fusion escapes 
you&#133;&#148; The battered demon said.

&#147;You&#146;re full of it!&#148; Earthstar said.

&#147;You don&#146;t believe me? You are a fool to underestimate the Darkforce, 
you little runt. I am going to show you my ultimate powers, this is it 
Starsoldiers, it ends here!!!&#148;  

The same dark aura returned and surrounded what was left of his 
damaged body. The wind picked up and rustled through the trees 
lightly, creating a haunting sound. The dark aura then enveloped his 
body, and Tanzanite yelled at the top of his beastly lungs, his 
screams echoing into the distance of the park. To the sadness and 
dismay of Lovestar, Waterstar and Earthstar, Tanzanite&#146;s energy 
returned to him, as strands of dark light wrapped around the remains 
of his body, and slowly, his wounds began to heal. The burned ribs 
grew back, the bones of the shoulder blade and right arm also 
returned. They regenerated with a sheet of thick muscle, then streams 
of veins and arteries, then a layer of ebony black, fleshy skin. 
However the recovery wasn&#146;t all&#133; Tanzanite gripped his hand and 
gritted his teeth painfully as he went into another transformation. 
Tanzanite&#146;s feet spilt into three toes with the nails growing sharper 
and thicker. The two spikes on his back and shoulders doubled into 
four, bursting out of the seams of his back. The blades on his arms 
grew twice as long as they were before. The main torso so became much 
larger that before, losing proportion with the rest of the body, as if 
nothing could stop its growth and the blood red eyes of the demon 
became a hauntingly clear white.  The previous instability of his body 
now became frantic, and the anger of the beast was quickly rising. 
Lovestar, Waterstar and Earthstar looked towards him, stunned to 
realize that not only had his body been repaired, but that his power 
had grown even stronger that before. Much stronger.

&#147;No&#133;&#148; Waterstar drifted.

&#147;It can&#146;t be&#133;&#148; Earthstar couldn&#146;t believe it.

&#147;He&#146;s even more powerful than before!&#148; Lovestar added. 

&#147;And now&#133;&#148; The demon said in strain, &#147;Now you die!!&#148;

Waterstar instantly ran behind Lovestar and raised her arms forward. 
Lovestar followed suit, to prepare the only attack that could stop 
him. 

&#147;Crystal Love Buster!!!&#148;

The two yelled out the attack and a second wave of golden, crystal 
energy headed for Demon-Tanzanite. The demon&#146;s rage erupted, and he 
fired an energy attack of his own to counter it. The blast ripped 
through the Crystal Love Buster as though it was nothing, and Lovestar 
and Waterstar had to leap out of its way as it neared them. Earthstar 
didn&#146;t wait for the attack to follow, and lunged for the Demon. As she 
reached him, the violet-eyed girl flung a punch, but recoiled in pain 
as the connection of fist and jaw felt like punching a wall of solid 
steel. Waterstar ran towards him quickly, and fired a Crystal frozen 
fraction at Demon-Tanzanite, but the attack just bounced of him, aimed 
back at her. Waterstar just leapt out of the way in the nick of time 
to avoid. Looking across from this was Sunstar, who was next to the 
wounded Firestar. She saw that the others were backing away slowly, 
and Tanzanite was fast closing in.  Sunstar stood quickly and called 
them over.

&#147;Hey you guys! Get over here!&#148;

The three quickly ran towards Sunstar and stood beside her.

&#147;Tanzanite is coming.&#148;  Said Waterstar.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;ll hold him off.&#148;

Sunstar placed her hands in front of her and gathered an energy ball. 
As Tanzanite reached close to them, she swerved the ball into the air, 
and the ball transformed into a large force field to protect them.  
Tanzanite snorted in contempt and fired an energy attack at the 
shield, luckily the shield was strong enough to block the attack.

&#147;My Super Nebular Refraction shield wont last long. We definitely need 
a plan and we need one now.&#148; Sunstar said.

&#147;Alright so what do we do?&#148; Lovestar asked.

&#147;I don&#146;t know&#133; any ideas Earthstar?&#148;

&#147;No, none. He is much stronger than all of us and there is nothing 
that we can do to stop him.&#148;

&#147;I know. Lets just blast the thing with all we have.&#148; Lovestar 
proposed.

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, we just blast him with everything we&#146;ve got all at once, maybe 
we could stop him!&#148;

&#147;What have we got to lose? We can&#146;t stay here forever and wait. I say 
we go.&#148; Waterstar said.

&#147;Very well, lets do it.&#148; Earthstar said.

&#147;I can&#146;t hold this up any longer you guys!&#148; Sunstar strained to keep 
it.

&#147; It&#146;s okay Sunstar, just let it down.&#148; Lovestar said. 

The Field of energy faded and Sunstar caught her breath. The four 
standing starsoldiers then ran around Demon-Tanzanite, and powered up. 
The over confident Demon merely stood, and laughed as the four 
starsoldiers began their pathetic attempt to survive. 

&#147;Crushing Love Blast!&#148;

&#147;Crystal Frozen Fraction!&#148;

&#147;Shining Sunset Beam!&#148;

&#147;Earthquake Splitting Barrage!&#148;

All four Starsoldiers unleashed their attacks at the beast that was 
once Tanzanite. Tanzanite guarded himself as the massive explosion 
rumbled in the park. Waves of smoke moved over the cold grass of the 
park.  All the Starsoldiers cowered in fear however when Tanzanite 
steeped out again, relatively okay. The demon didn&#146;t say anything, 
just smiled mockingly again and fired a hi-powered attack at 
Waterstar. This time she was not fast enough to dodge it, and was hit 
violently, and chucked away. 

&#147;Waterstar!!!&#148;

Lovestar ran erratically toward the fallen starsoldier, only to have 
Tanzanite blur in front of her and slug her in the gut. Lovestar 
coughed sharply and fell to knees. Sunstar and Earthstar ran towards 
Demon-Tanzanite to try and catch him off-guard, but couldn&#146;t lay a 
finger on him as the giant beast grabbed them both by the wrists and 
swung them into the air. Like a soul leech, Tanzanite drained them of 
there energy through the pours in his hand. The two starsoldiers 
passed out when the demon absorbed all their power, and tossed them 
aside. The demon then smiled widely as he pointed his palm towards 
Lovestar, who was still wheezing from the previous punch. He was going 
to end this game once and for all&#133;

&#147;Shooting Fireball Strike!!!&#148;

Demon-Tanzanite felt a sphere of fire bounce off his back and 
incinerate a nearby tree. He turned around to see Firestar, weakened 
with only one eye open, and her fingers wrapped tightly around her 
wound. The demon laughed demonically as he ran towards her like a 
steamroller, with no thought or conscience. The Dark General grabbed 
her viciously by the neck, and slipped the other arm down Firestar&#146;s 
waist, and gripped the wound on the edge of her abdomen. 

&#147;AAAAAAHHHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!&#148;

Firestar shrieked and writhed in agony as the demon sunk his large and 
powerful iron grip into sensitive, bloody flesh. Firestar&#146;s screams 
felt like daggers in Earthstar&#146;s heart, but she couldn&#146;t get over 
there, she was paralyzed with a helpless sense of inertia.  Lovestar, 
near tears, begged and pleaded with Demon-Tanzanite to stop, but he 
didn&#146;t listen. Firestar continued to scream in pain and Lovestar 
couldn&#146;t take it any longer. All the stones on the cold grass of the 
floor rose and fell, as a furious golden energy surrounded the Goddess 
of Love and Peace. Demon-Tanzanite, Waterstar, Sunstar and Earthstar 
all looked towards her as she stood, covered in a massive golden 
light. The shining light moved as Lovestar did, and she walked slowly 
towards Tanzanite, who had Firestar in his death grip. Lovestar, 
acting as if she had no control over her actions, raised her hands 
into the air.

&#147;Crushing Love Blast!!!&#148;

A massive Crushing Love Blast smashed into Demon-Tanzanite, and the 
beast was thrown away across the park, relinquishing Firestar from his 
clutches. Demon-Tanzanite quickly recovered however, and fired rapid 
energy blasts from each hand at Lovestar. The chestnut haired 
Starsoldier would not be out done this time, and each shot was negated 
by her mighty energy. Lovestar began to stalk the demon, walking 
towards him slowly, but with a disposition masked with hatred&#133; 
suddenly though, the energy left her. She fell to her knees, weakened 
and drained from that power. Demon-Tanzanite laughed in his 
superiority, but frowned when he got a look at his stomach&#133; bleeding&#133; 
Lovestar still stood up, weak and limp, trying to maintain some form 
of balance and fell into a deep trance from which she was unable to 
hear the cries of Sunstar and Waterstar&#133;

&#147;Can you hear me&#133;Lovestar?&#148; A voice deep in her mind called to her.

&#147;Who&#133; are you&#133;?&#148; She asked.

&#147;Who are you?&#148;

&#147;What are you talking about? What&#146;s going on?&#148;

&#147;Lovestar you are letting your power leave you. It is your destiny to 
learn how to control it so you may defeat the evil of Darkforce.&#148;

&#147;But it&#146;s too hard&#133; I can&#146;t control that kind of power. It&#146;s too 
strong for me&#133; I can&#146;t do it!&#148;

&#147;Yes you can.&#148;

&#147;No I can&#146;t! It&#146;s too hard! Whenever I try to utilize that power, it 
leaves me!&#148;

&#147;That is because you haven&#146;t learned how to control it.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#148;

&#147;It is not impossible. You can manipulate the deep hidden root of your 
strength, Lovestar. Trust me. How else will you be able to save your 
friends?&#148;

&#147;My friends&#133;Sunstar&#133; and Earthstar and Firestar&#133; and Waterstar&#133; I need 
to get back there. I must save them!&#148;

&#147;You can Lovestar. And you will. Just trust me and let your spirit 
guide your actions.&#148;

&#147;I will&#133; Thank you.&#148;

&#147;It is time. To unlock one of your hidden powers.&#148;

&#147;My hidden powers&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Yes&#133; the Gates of Eternity.&#148;

Lovestar, still in her trance, made certain quick and shallow arm 
swipes with her body. Each body movement created some kind of symbol 
of spirit energy, visible only to Lovestar in this state. Lovestar 
then spoke, almost mechanically, with no hesitation or doubt.

&#147;Waterstar, Sunstar. Take Firestar and Earthstar and get out of here 
right now.&#148;

Waterstar and Sunstar looked shocked. Leave Lovestar alone with this 
beast?

&#147;Are you insane? There is no way I am leaving this park without you 
Lovestar!&#148; Waterstar yelled.

&#147;Waterstar is right! You cannot fight him alone!&#148; Sunstar protested.

Lovestar&#146;s hair rose upright into the air as she continued to make 
those strange arm maneuvers, and her golden energy returned to her.

&#147;Listen to me. You have to get out now! Tanzanite must die and I am 
the only one who can defeat him, now leave! You know in your hearts 
what I am doing is right!&#148;

Waterstar was still not convinced, and was about to go over there when 
Sunstar grabbed her hand.

&#147;She&#146;ll be okay Waterstar.&#148;

&#147;But I&#133;&#148; Waterstar began on the verge of tears, &#147;I can&#146;t just leave 
her&#133;&#148;

&#147;She&#146;ll be okay! Trust her! You wont lose her Waterstar; she&#146;ll come 
back to us. Just have faith.&#148;

Waterstar nodded gently and looked back at Lovestar.

&#147;I&#146;m leaving you Lovestar, don&#146;t you dare lose okay?&#148;

Lovestar nodded in response, and Waterstar and Sunstar picked up 
Earthstar and Firestar, who had aided them, and cleared out of the 
park through the front gate. Tanzanite stepped up holding his bleeding 
stomach, and stared at the trance Lovestar was in. 

&#147;You little fool. Do you really believe you can stop me? For your 
arrogance, I am going to send to the deepest pits of hell. You will 
roil in the sweet agony of darkness and my kind will rule over earth 
as the ultimate force in the universe!!!&#148;

&#147;Oh no you wont Tanzanite&#133; but you were right about one thing.&#148;

&#147;And what was that?&#148;

&#147;It ends here.&#148;

The ground under Lovestar separated and cracked, and a large tremor 
passed over the entire park. The dark drifting clouds in the sky 
thickened over, and a chorus of thunder erupted into the night. 
Tanzanite then gasped in fright as he realized what was about to 
happen. As soon as Lovestar completed her arm movements, a gargantuan 
beam of phenomenally powerful golden energy blasted up in the ground, 
into the air. The ground erupted as the full force of the attack 
revealed itself. Tanzanite screamed in torment as he felt his bulky 
body roil in the solid fountain of piercingly bright golden energy A 
couple of blocks away from the park, Waterstar looked back to see a 
towering beam of energy shooting up into the sky, and she looked down, 
to see the force of the energy was splitting the sidewalk in cracks 
from this distance&#133; Waterstar gasped as she came to a shocking 
conclusion&#133;

&#147;If she completes this attack&#133; she&#146;ll die!!!&#148;

&#147;Lovestar!!!&#148;

Lovestar raised both hands into the air, and was about to make the 
final move to finish the attack, when she felt something inside her 
tell her to stop. Just in time, the chestnut haired girl snapped out 
of her trance, slowly felt herself drifting towards the ground, but 
not before hearing Tanzanite&#146;s plangent screams as his black, oily 
flesh was roasted in the pandemonium of the awesome attack&#133;ten minutes 
later, the beam slowly subsided, and Waterstar returned to the park to 
find a gigantic creator, around sixty five metres long and around five 
metres deep, stretched across the even, grassy land. The Goddess of 
the sea caught sight of Lovestar, who was unconscious at the epicentre 
of the massive creator, and she ran down the smoke-soiled black hole 
to reach her. Waterstar kneel next to the chestnut haired girl, and 
cradled her love in her arms. She looked down on her, gently stroked 
the strands of hair off of her forehead, and softly kissed her there.

&#147;Lovestar&#133; just how powerful are you?&#148;

Just hovering over the wasted park, flying in the night sky, was a 
tall woman with crimson red hair, staring at the result of that 
battle, with an evil smile on her face...

&#147;I told you Tanzanite. You are, oh excuse me, you were a failure. 
Invoking the forbidden arts and still losing? That&#146;s proof enough. Now 
this operation is mine! The earth will tremble at the name of Garnet!&#148;
