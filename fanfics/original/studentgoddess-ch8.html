<h1>The Student and the Goddess (part 8 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>      Krystal and Isaka decided to conveniently disappear, leaving Eveon and Mina to wonder 
what exactly they were doing there. &quot;Did they just stop by to visit?&quot; Mina asked while 
placing her flowers in a nearby vase, but her girlfriend only shrugged.

      &quot;Eveon! You&#39;ve gotten so big!&quot; The blonde girl was suddenly assaulted by Erin and 
pulled into a huge hug. Mina just stared as her girlfriend was engulfed by another girl. 
&quot;Eh? Wh-what,&quot; Eveon choked out as Erin let her go. It took the blonde girl a minute to 
figure who exactly was holding her.

      &quot;Erin?! What&#39;re you doing here?&quot; The brunette just laughed and patted Eveon on the 
head. &quot;It&#39;s actually a long, complicated, unfortunate story... but,&quot; Erin looked over at 
Mina and gave her a huge hug as well. &quot;I can&#39;t believe how big the two of you have gotten! I 
used to baby-sit you guys all the time and now...!&quot;

      Abby just watched from the top of the stairs, waiting for the poo to hit the fan, so 
to speak. Erin didn&#39;t know exactly how much her favorite little kids had changed since she 
left a few years back. Sometimes Abby felt like an evil person for not forewarning Erin... 
then again... She smiled. It would be a crime for Abby not to get a laugh out of this.

      &quot;...so you guys are still best friends?&quot; Erin asked, after a few minutes of 
re-introductions and a condensed version of getting saved by Krystal and Isaka.

      The two girls just exchanged awkward glances. Erin was curious if this was what Abby 
was referring to when she said the two girls had changed a lot. Mina was the one who decided 
to break the ice. &quot;We... aren&#39;t exactly friends anymore,&quot; she murmured and then intertwined 
her hand with Eveon&#39;s.

      Of course, in a sheer fit of naivet&Atilde;&copy;, Erin didn&#39;t get it. &quot;Um... really? You two still 
seem really close, so I don&#39;t think I get what you&#39;re saying...?&quot;

      Eveon decided to be blunt. &quot;We&#39;re... in love.&quot;

      Abby just smiled smugly to herself, getting a perfect view of Erin&#39;s blank face. The 
brunette took a minute to let it sink in before vocally expressing her confusion. &quot;Wh-what?! 
You two are... are... um, not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that, but I just, uh... um... 
I thought, that, uh... well, jeez I should have known! Gah! Don&#39;t tell me someone else is 
gay and I totally haven&#39;t picked up on it yet!!!&quot;

      First Krystal and Isaka, now Eveon and Mina? This was preposterous! How did these 
things just slip under her nose? She had no problem with them being together, it was just...

      &quot;I should have known you two were too friendly when I baby-sat!&quot; As Erin went through 
her inner conflict, Abby enjoyed the spectacle. It got even more interesting thanks to Mina.

      &quot;Erin, is that a snake on your arm?&quot;

      &quot;Huh, why yes it- AH! No Posh-Posh! You aren&#39;t allowed to go into my shirt again!&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;I love you...&quot;

      &quot;Oh, but I love you too...&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, well I love you even more...&quot;

      &quot;...yet I love you more than anything else...&quot;

      &quot;Krys-tal! That&#39;s cheating...&quot;

      The blonde woman just giggled at Isaka&#39;s protest. Currently, the couple had holed 
themselves up in their room. The demon was lounging comfortably in her exorcist&#39;s arms, 
using the blonde&#39;s bosom as a cushion. She had to admit that she quite loved snuggling with 
Krystal. Speaking of which, she was currently stroking Isaka&#39;s head and giving her small 
kisses. Their intense cuddle session followed their make up scene in the hallway.

      &quot;You never did elaborate on how life was before me... I never knew you were hurt that 
badly...&quot; Krystal murmured before leaning down and giving Isaka a lingering kiss on the 
cheek. &quot;Well, I never like talking about it, especially when I have you to think about.&quot;

      This resulted in more kisses and snuggles, but that was when the demon decided to get 
down to business. &quot;While we have settled our sex problem,&quot; Krystal blushed slightly as Isaka 
pushed her down on the bed, &quot;we still have another to contend with.&quot;

      Krystal just stared up at the demon now straddling her waist. &quot;I don&#39;t know what being 
on top of me has to do with the situation-&quot; Isaka just smirked. &quot;It doesn&#39;t. I just miss 
being on top, as much as I love playing bottom.&quot;

      She leaned down and secured a kiss from Krystal before the other woman continued on. 
&quot;Anyways, what are we going to do about Erin?&quot; The demon sighed and lied herself on top of 
Krystal. &quot;That&#39;s a hard call. Erin&#39;s body is starting to react to being a vessel, seeing how 
she&#39;s comfortable with that snake, Poosh-Poosh or whatever, but it&#39;s her mind I&#39;m worried 
about...&quot;

      Krystal started to stroke the demon&#39;s head again. &quot;What do you think we should do? 
Erin&#39;s not going to be hurt, but she&#39;s obviously scared... especially since she was born to 
be the goddess&#39;s other half, so...&quot;

      The two lovers exchanged knowing looks before smiling. That unseen communication Abby 
so despised passed between them.

      &quot;Isaka, you think we should...?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah... it&#39;s the right thing, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 

***** 

      As Erin ate her food, she was once again confused. She&#39;d managed to last through the 
day, regardless of dealing with her new &#39;pet&#39; snake, walking in on lesbians, giving lesbian 
love advice, and finding out that those two best friends were lesbians as well. Erin was 
half afraid that Seth was secretly a girl in disguise, and Abby was keeping a lesbian lover 
in the basement.

      At this point, the vessel of the snake goddess was sure anything could happen. But if 
something was going to happen, there was fifty percent chance there would be lesbians. She 
surveyed the scene around her. Seth was embarrassed because Tycara kept trying to feed him 
his food. That wasn&#39;t the embarrassing part, but the fact was Tycara was emulating what Mina 
was doing with Eveon.

      Erin could feel for the young man. He was the only guy here and Abby constantly 
referred to him as the &#39;balancer&#39;... whatever that meant. Then there was Krystal and Isaka. 
You see, they weren&#39;t being as cute and cuddly as the other two couples, but...

      They kept shooting her strange looks. The kind of looks a thanksgiving turkey gets 
before it&#39;s sent off to the slaughter house. She would have continued to contemplate why 
they were looking at her like that, but her thoughts were interrupted by none other than 
Abby.

      &quot;You looked stressed.&quot; Erin just looked up at the blonde woman and gave her a strained 
smile. &quot;Yeah, I just... I don&#39;t know... I just started thinking about all the stuff that&#39;s 
happened in two days and everyone&#39;s so...&quot; She wasn&#39;t sure what to say without it sounding 
rude.

      The young mother sat next to her before laying a reassuring hand on her shoulder. &quot;I 
know you feel out of place, but no worries.&quot; Suddenly, she brandished a bottle of champagne. 
&quot;Single people unite!&quot; She shouted triumphantly and popped the cork. Erin had a look on her 
face that basically said &#39;you-gotta-be-sh***ing-me&#39;.

      &quot;Mommy! What&#39;re you doing?&quot; Eveon tried to reach across the table and save poor Erin 
from her crazy mother.

      &quot;Oh, please, Eveon. Me and Erin are just going to partake in some adult activities... 
But not the kind you and Mina participate in.&quot; The 15 year old blushed a furious shade of 
red. Abby disregarded her daughter and started pouring Erin a glass. &quot;Trust me, you&#39;re going 
to want to drink this.&quot;

      &quot;U-um, isn&#39;t Erin only 18...?&quot; Mina asked, looking around the table. Everyone else 
exchanged looks. &quot;So, uh, Tycara! How about me and you go get some ice cream in town?&quot; The 
angel demon hybrid stared at her boyfriend before catching on. &quot;Of course, Seth! Let&#39;s go!&quot;

      Having visited before, the hetero couple knew NOT to be around Abby when she broke out 
alcohol. Poor little Eveon did not have the option of escaping her drunk mother. She didn&#39;t 
mind it when the 34 year old decided to have a few sips, it was just the jokes! They were 
unbearable...

      Erin took a sip from the glass to appease the crazy person that was Abby, but the 
young mother had already downed a glass of her own. &quot;Don&#39;t look at me like that... Eveon, 
you can&#39;t get drunk off one glass of champagne. Just give me a few more and then things will 
be fun. Kind of like when you sneak into Mina&#39;s room... that kind of fun but less messy!&quot;

      At that point, Eveon had enough. She stood up in her seat and pointed accusingly at 
her mother, &quot;Stop saying that! Me and Mina haven&#39;t had sex and probably won&#39;t have it for a 
long while! I-I mean, saying we have sex all the time is like saying Isaka and Krystal are 
practicing abstinence!&quot;

      The exorcist and the demon, who had thus far decided to be quiet and stay out of the 
conversation, now found themselves dragged into it. There was an awkward silence.

      &quot;Um, Eveon... me and Isaka... uh, we haven&#39;t done it,&quot; Krystal murmured.

      Mina and Eveon exchanged looks, but it was the ebony haired girl who spoke, &quot;Wh-what? 
You mean, you two have never... you know... together?&quot; Isaka shook her head. &quot;Nope. 
Krystal&#39;s got me on a leash... but I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.&quot; With that, the two 
older lovers exchanged happy looks and cuddled.

      Unfortunately for Eveon, she&#39;d just self incriminated herself. &quot;Oh wow. Wow. I-I was 
seriously just kidding about you two, but now...&quot; Abby started to pour herself another 
glass, her eyes widened. &quot;I think I actually have to worry.&quot;

      &quot;Mommy! I didn&#39;t mean it like that! I-I... w-we haven&#39;t done anything... we haven&#39;t 
even touched each other anywhere...!&quot; As the conversation continued, Erin just kept sipping 
at her glass of champagne. Maybe she&#39;d be lucky enough to pass out and find out that this 
was all just a crazy dream filled with lesbians and snakes and demons...

      &quot;E-Eveon... I think me and you are going to have to have that talk pretty soon...&quot; 
Upon hearing Abby speak, Erin started to drink faster. 

***** 

      Now an hour after the dinner party, those still conscious were cleaning up. Tycara and 
Seth had decided to go for ice cream and scan the surrounding area in case the goddess 
showed up. In the mean time, Eveon and Mina were helping a passed out Abby get back up to 
her room. With some effort and an almost spill on the stairs, the two girls had managed to 
ease her into her bed.

      &quot;There you go, Mommy... you really shouldn&#39;t down one bottle so fast,&quot; Eveon murmured. 
She may put up a huge fuss about the jokes, but she really didn&#39;t mind her mother all that 
much. &quot;I know... but Erin helped me too...&quot; The 18 year old had finally drunk herself into 
submission and was currently sleeping on the couch in the living room.

      &quot;Yeah, just get some sleep. I left some aspirin by your bed so you can deal with your 
hangover tomorrow.&quot; Abby tried not to laugh at her daughter. &quot;Thanks, Eveon... don&#39;t stay up 
to late, alright?&quot; The blonde girl just nodded and gave her mother a kiss on the cheek. 
&quot;Goodnight, Mommy. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have nice dreams of Daddy.&quot;

      Abby just curled up in the bed as her daughter turned out the lights and walked over 
to Mina, who was patiently waiting at the door. As they shut it and walked out into the 
hallway, Mina said, &quot;I don&#39;t understand why you let her buy so much alcohol. I&#39;m sure if 
just told her not to, your mom wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

      Eveon just shrugged. &quot;If we don&#39;t laugh, we cry. That&#39;s what she told me once. Mommy 
didn&#39;t always act like this, but ever since Daddy died, it&#39;s always been tough for her. If 
she drank some, she had fun... I don&#39;t really like it, but she doesn&#39;t do it that often, so 
I guess it&#39;s okay...&quot; Mina looked at the ground solemnly.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I never stopped to think about how sad your mother is because your dad 
died...&quot; Eveon just smiled. &quot;It&#39;s cool. I&#39;m just hoping she finds someone to take care of 
her one day...&quot;

      By the time she said that, the two girls were back down in the kitchen. &quot;Someone to 
take care of who...?&quot; Isaka asked, drying the dishes that Krystal washed. &quot;Oh,&quot; Eveon said, 
&quot;My Mommy. She&#39;s only 34 so people will still take her, right?&quot;

      Krystal looked quite thoughtful. &quot;Wow, I always thought your mom was young... yet she 
only looks a few years older than me and Isaka. I could have mistaken her for your sister.&quot; 
The demon only nodded in agreement.

      &quot;In my humble opinion, I believe Abby is a total MILF.&quot;

      Krystal almost dropped the plate she was washing and Mina&#39;s eyes bulged. Eveon, 
however, didn&#39;t know what Isaka was talking about. The exorcist was about to smack her demon 
across the face. &quot;Isaka! Don&#39;t say things like that...!&quot;

      She just pouted. &quot;What...? She&#39;s an attractive woman okay! If I hadn&#39;t of run into 
you, or if I didn&#39;t know Eveon, I definitely would have considered it. I have a thing for 
blondes, okay?&quot; Isaka laughed to herself. &quot;Of course, you would know that Krystal, but 
still. She&#39;s beautiful, tall, and has big boo.......&quot;

      It was at this time that Isaka remembered that Abby&#39;s daughter was right behind her. 
Eveon hadn&#39;t caught on to what MILF stood for, but... &quot;My Mommy has big whats, Isaka? Would 
you like to finish your sentence?&quot;

      The demon bit her bottom lip deviously before setting down the dish towel and turning 
around. &quot;I was just saying that your mother is EXTREMELY attractive and I would totally hit 
that if I weren&#39;t head over heels in love with Krystal. Wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; She asked her 
girlfriend right next to her. Krystal let out a sigh. &quot;Alright, yes, her mom is really 
beautiful and attractive...&quot;

      Eveon was trying not to gape, but Mina totally made the situation worse. &quot;Yeah... your 
mom is really pretty...&quot; The blonde girl whirled around. &quot;Not you too, Mina!&quot; The ebony 
haired girl just let out an awkward giggle. &quot;Well, she used to walk around at night in 
nothing but a tank top and undies and when I was 12 I started to notice... so, uh... she&#39;s 
just really pretty.&quot;

      At that moment, all four girls whirled around when they heard glass break against the 
tiled floor. There, in a moment of perfectly bad timing, was Abby. The young mother&#39;s eyes 
were quite wide and she was, rather ironically, now only dressed in a tank top and panties.

      &quot;Please tell me that while I came downstairs to get a glass of water, I was really 
sleepwalking due to my drunken stupor and had a crazy dream that three lesbians in my house 
were discussing with my lesbian daughter how much they&#39;d like to have lesbian sex with me 
because I&#39;m apparently a lesbian sex fantasy...?&quot;

      There was a moment of silence. Abby just turned around and started going back 
upstairs. &quot;I really need to stop drinking so much...&quot; The four girls in the kitchen 
exchanged looks. &quot;Smooth, Isaka, smooth,&quot; Eveon muttered and the demon just glared at her. 
&quot;Hey! I wasn&#39;t the only one! Krystal and Mina think she&#39;s hot too!&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, but we didn&#39;t call her a MILF,&quot; Mina pointed out. Krystal just gave her demon a 
small whap on the head. &quot;Isaka, what happened to not being so focused on sex?&quot; The brown 
haired woman pouted. &quot;Krys-tal! It&#39;s not like that...!&quot;

      It was at this point that Eveon asked, &quot;What&#39;s a MILF?&quot; Another awkward silence 
permeated the room.
