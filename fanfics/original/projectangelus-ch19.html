<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>      Solomon was disappointed in himself as he returned back to the mansion. He should 
have grabbed Eveon much faster than to let her stall and talk to him... he shouldn&#39;t have 
retreated either. He could have easily taken down Miki.

      Alas, he already made his choice and walked down the long hallway, hearing remnants 
of music floating around. He chuckled as he entered the ballroom, Death Dolls paired up all 
along the dance floor. Pandora was tenderly leading some of them by the hand to partner up 
with others and having some hold trays.

      &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Solomon asked and Pandora turned around with a smile.

      &quot;We&#39;re practicing a party,&quot; the fiend replied before motioning over to the record 
play. &quot;Unfortunately, that&#39;s all I have to play the music...&quot;

      It was definitely classical ballroom music, something Solomon wasn&#39;t too surprised to 
hear. Pandora was slightly upset that it wouldn&#39;t play loud enough nor did it seem 
sophisticated. &quot;Do you want me to get you a pianist?&quot; he asked, referring to the black 
piano in the back of the room, the bench empty. 

      &quot;I already have one,&quot; Pandora said proudly. &quot;He doesn&#39;t have the sight, but I just 
want him to play for me.&quot;

      As if on cue, Solomon could hear the sounds of a scuffle behind him. Pandora turned 
off the record player and eagerly awaited her guest. It was a young man being dragged into 
the room by two Death Dolls and Solomon had to assume that he was just a college student.

      &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; he shouted, trying to pull his arms away.

      &quot;I need you to play for me,&quot; Pandora told him as he looked around the room wildly. He 
swallowed, suddenly realizing how creepy everything was with pairs of the same dressed 
people frozen in childish dancing frame.

      &quot;Play... play what?&quot; he asked, still looking around.

      &quot;The piano of course!&quot; she said, walking over to the beautifully polished black 
instrument. The Death Dolls let him go and the young man followed her cautiously. What 
choice did he have?

      &quot;Play me something nice... like a symphony,&quot; Pandora said, clasping her hands 
together patiently. He nodded curtly and sat down.

      &quot;That&#39;s all you want?&quot; he asked, his hands shaking slightly. She just grinned at him 
and he took that as a yes. The instrument was very nice... and he started to play the piano 
arrangement of Beethoven&#39;s 9th symphony. The notes came off shaky at first, but he started 
to gain confidence with each note.

      He suddenly stopped awkwardly, saying, &quot;I don&#39;t... really remember much of the rest 
of that. Was that good enough...?&quot;

      Pandora nodded, exuberant. &quot;It&#39;s perfect! I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll make an excellent pianist 
for my party.&quot;

      He looked around, unsure of what she meant. &quot;P... party... right.&quot;

      Pandora walked over to the bench. &quot;Of course. I&#39;m going to through a big party once 
Eveon becomes my Death Doll.&quot;

      The young man stood up, backing away from her. &quot;That&#39;s great, but I really need to be 
getting home.&quot;

      &quot;Ah, but this is your home now,&quot; she said cheerfully.

      Before he could respond, she placed a hand on his chest. The young man almost keeled 
over at the shock of dark energy that was forced into his system. &quot;Don&#39;t try to fight it,&quot; 
she said. &quot;It hurts more if you do.&quot;

      He suddenly collapsed into the awaiting arms of two other Death Dolls, nearly 
comatose. &quot;Could you give him a bath please?&quot;

      Her obedient servants carried him off as she went over to Solomon. &quot;He does play 
quite well, doesn&#39;t he?&quot;

      Solomon nodded. &quot;Indeed... I tried my hand at capturing Eveon but failed terribly...&quot;

      Pandora pouted. &quot;Failed...? Did you get caught off guard again?&quot;

      &quot;Yes... I... I&#39;m very sorry. I know how much you want her,&quot; Solomon murmured, looking 
off at a wall.

      Pandora started to walk ahead of him and he followed. &quot;It&#39;s fine... all that matters 
is that you try for me,&quot; she said, smiling at him over her shoulder. Solomon was 
immediately relieved and began to calm down as they entered Pandora&#39;s workshop.

      She began to pick out fabric and designs and other things that Solomon was unfamiliar 
with. The little girl sat down with a needle and began to sew with an alarming precision. 
&quot;Is Eveon really cute? She sounds like she is,&quot; Pandora said thoughtfully.

      &quot;She is,&quot; Solomon affirmed, watching the needle as it moved to create a black jacket. 
&quot;I learned something interesting about her.&quot;

      The needled paused before assuming its fast rate. Pandora&#39;s smile widened. &quot;Really? 
Tell me, Solomon.&quot;

      &quot;It would seem that Eveon prefers girls,&quot; he said, watching Pandora sew in little 
decorations into the jacket.

      The young fiend only giggled as she started on a pair of black pants. &quot;I prefer 
girls, too. I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s so interesting.&quot;

      Solomon just smiled at her as she finished up the outfit. &quot;Not quite in the way 
you&#39;re thinking Pandora...&quot;

      She stared at him in innocent curiosity before she realized exactly what he meant. 
&quot;Really?!&quot; she gushed. &quot;How adorable! It&#39;s so rare for me to get a doll that&#39;s like 
that...!&quot;

      Pandora set down the pants next to the jacket, looking at him with excited eyes. 
&quot;Eveon sounds absolutely wonderful! I wish I could meet her...&quot; Solomon could tell the 
little girl was thinking of something as her smile began to disappear.

      &quot;I wonder... we need to get her before the Shadow Organization does,&quot; Pandora said 
finally. &quot;If they get her first, they&#39;re going to want to use her as the Key...&quot;

      Solomon nodded. &quot;Right. Then we may never have a way to get a hold of her if that 
happens.&quot;

      &quot;We&#39;ll figure it out,&quot; the young fiend said confidently as her smile returned. &quot;Oh, 
but do you think Eveon has a girlfriend? I really want to know!&quot;

      &quot;Most likely,&quot; Solomon said, watching Pandora take out a carefully prepared, white 
mask. &quot;Why? Would you like to be with her?&quot;

      Pandora looked up from the mask and frowned. Solomon just laughed at her expression. 
&quot;I just wanted to know because I&#39;m sure they are a cute couple! I don&#39;t like to play with 
my toys like that.&quot;

      The man just continued to smile as her slightly sour mood faded away. She painted a 
music note on the mask, setting it beside the outfit. &quot;You and I both promised that we 
wouldn&#39;t do any of that until we could turn humans in to fiends,&quot; Pandora murmured.

      &quot;True... I was only trying to make you smile,&quot; Solomon said, watching as the young 
pianist was brought into the room by the Death Dolls.

      He was still in a strange trance due to the dark energy from Pandora and the Death 
Dolls laid him down on a table in the room. &quot;If only my body wasn&#39;t so young,&quot; Pandora 
said, ruffling up her skirt as she looked at a mirror in the room. &quot;Then we could have lots 
and lots of babies.&quot;

      Solomon just sighed. &quot;It&#39;s alright. I would rather we didn&#39;t ever have a relationship 
like that...&quot; The thought had always made him feel... wrong.

      She smiled at him. &quot;I know. I guess that would be our last resort when I get older... 
we aren&#39;t really related after all.&quot;

      He chuckled at her wording. &quot;True. But we might as well be.&quot;

      Pandora began to dress the young man in the black outfit she had just sewn. Solomon 
watched her careful movements and childlike tendencies. She had chosen herself not to grow 
older into a woman, not just yet, because she wanted to experience a childhood she&#39;d never 
had.

      Perhaps they could have children one day, but as Solomon watched her play with each 
and every one of her toys, he knew she&#39;d much rather have a huge family to be with. Pandora 
finished dressing the young man and grabbed the mask to place on his face. She parted his 
lips with her fingers before leaning down and kissing him.

      &#39;Kiss&#39; wasn&#39;t exactly what it was, as Solomon knew, for it was the way Pandora 
transferred her mass amount of dark energy into humans to turn them into Death Dolls. She 
placed the mask onto the young man&#39;s face and he got off of the table, moving awkwardly. 
After a few minutes, he was moving normally and Pandora sent him out of the room.

      &quot;Let&#39;s go rehearse the party now,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;I want everything to be 
perfect!&quot;
