<h1>All Girls School (part 102 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch101.html">Back to Part 101</a><pre>Janine Bautista felt bittersweet about it being so late in the month. 
Now that soccer season was officially over&#151;championship this year went 
to Laudendale, which was typically more of an academic rival than a 
sports rival&#151;and all those warm, weary, difficult days of April were 
almost behind her, she had a moment of serenity before the nightmare of 
Prom and the more hectic nightmare of finals came around. In a way, this 
weekend here was the calm before the storm (much as she hated that 
clich&eacute;). She wouldn&#39;t have any other opportunities to really enjoy 
herself. Janine had a job coming in the summer, her first, and knew that 
from then on out, long days of idle vacation would go out the window.

&quot;It&#39;s just like early in the school year,&quot; she mused to herself, lying 
flat on a bed of grass, nothing but sky above her. &quot;We wanted to 
accomplish so much before we got bogged down by schoolwork, and look 
where we are now. We&#39;re all struggling just to have a breather. A lot 
has gone on.&quot; Nobody answered her, except the wind. She was alone, but 
by choice. As outgoing and dependent as she was, Janine sometimes needed 
these moments by herself. It took her mind off work, off school, even 
off her friends.

Ah, her friends. Idiots. They all went to Lilian&#39;s pool party, and were 
no doubt having fun. Janine declined ferociously, saying she needed a 
few days just to herself. She loved her friends, but sometimes they 
could smother her, especially when it came to her &quot;romantic life&quot;&#151;the 
one they had concocted. Okay, so she liked May, big deal. Why did they 
have to make such a fuss over it? It wasn&#39;t like they were dating, and 
they didn&#39;t hang around each other as much as they used to. People had 
started addressing them as &quot;Maynine&quot;, squishing their names together 
like they did to all couples. If nothing else, this isolation gave 
Janine room to breathe and stretch her elbows.

&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; she ruminated, and reached her limbs out as far as 
they could go. Bugs, dirt, and grass stains were the least of her 
worries&#151;why else bring an older shirt and worn-out jeans to the park? 
Now that she was stretched out, she felt like a part of nature, 
sandwiched between the sky above her and the earth beneath&#151;the ultimate 
middle woman.

&quot;Man is a strange creature,&quot; she murmured, shielding her eyes from a 
protruding sun. &quot;Born from a union between the earth and the sky. God 
from the heavens came down, dug us from the soil, and breathed within 
our lungs a soul. We are more than people of mud, but less than those in 
the skies. We are in the middle. I am...in the middle, yet I do not feel 
compressed. I feel so free now. It&#39;s like...maybe an embrace of the 
elements. Earth and sky, fire from the sun and water from the stream, 
swirling endlessly in a dance that man cannot understand, only observe. 
They surround us, help us, destroy us, and continue to remind us that we 
are not the real masters.&quot;

In response, the wind blew, trees lost their leaves, and the ground 
seemed to sigh. A thick cloud covered the sun; Janine sat up and cleaned 
her hair of grass. She pulled her knees to her chest and hugged them.

&quot;I,&quot; she spoke, into the heart of the world. &quot;I am I. My eye perceives 
my I. My I knows my ai. I understand, aye. The ai understands the eye, 
aye, and I bind it all to create a new being. The beast that shouted ai 
at the heart of the world... Perception. Identity. Love. Understanding. 
The four components of man. Fire, earth, air, and water&#151;the four 
components of nature. As man perceives, understands, and loves, he gains 
his identity. As man interacts with the elements, he is witness to 
nature, and the wake of his Maker. I am. I am...myself. I am Janine. And 
I&#39;m...bloody exhausted from all this philosophy.&quot;

&quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;

&quot;All Girls School&quot; Chapter 100

by Mr. Toasty

May Tramble didn&#39;t go to that pool party either. A whole lot of people 
were invited, including her, but she turned down the offer. Unlike 
Janine, she didn&#39;t go because she wanted to be alone; she didn&#39;t go 
because she had homework to do. With soccer behind and prom ahead, now 
was a good time to get caught up. She was slowly failing two courses, 
and pessimism and procrastination kept her from going any further. At 
this rate, she&#39;d be beaten by her own little sister...

Who, for all records and purposes, might&#39;ve been skinny dipping right 
now.

May had enjoyed the game, but she had no illusions about Prom. As she 
expected, she didn&#39;t get to keep any boyfriends for a long period of 
time&#151;heck, it was a miracle she even had that one or two&#151;and all those 
&quot;lesbian&quot; rumors circling around her certainly didn&#39;t help. Guys liked 
you if you were a gay girl, sure, but get serious about the whole thing 
and it&#39;s goodbye. May wasn&#39;t serious&#151;at most, she was slightly 
curious&#151;but that didn&#39;t do anything to silence those rumors. 
Well...maybe she was more than curious. Hadn&#39;t she admitted an 
attraction to somebody before? Didn&#39;t she just have the smallest, 
teeniest, tiniest crush on a certain someone? DIDN&#39;T she?

&quot;I can&#39;t do this,&quot; she groused, stopping homework just to complain. &quot;I 
can&#39;t let my mind drift. I have to focus.&quot; She turned on some music, and 
her thoughts were tuned out. May was productive again. But all things 
had their place, even ridiculous Sapphic considerations. She vowed to 
think it over, maybe even discuss it with Janine, as soon as her 
homework was finished. It wasn&#39;t procrastination. It was just being 
responsible.
Two hours later...

&quot;Hiya, May!&quot; They both smiled, though separated by distance. It was 
Janine who called, and she knew May hated being called &quot;Hey May&quot;.

&quot;Hey &#145;Nean. I was just thinking about you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really? I hope it wasn&#39;t anything bad.&quot;

&quot;No, nothing of the kind. Listen, you doing anything?&quot;

&quot;Nope, got my whole day ahead of me.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t go with the others?&quot;

&quot;Nah, I wanted some time to myself. But I&#39;d like some company now. Are 
you free?&quot;

&quot;Free as a bird. Guess you wanna do something together.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...I figure without the goon squad hanging around us, we&#39;ll 
actually pull off something like a normal life.&quot; May laughed, and the 
two agreed on a place to meet. They said their farewells and hung 
up&#151;then a thought just occurred to both girls. Had they just asked each 
other out on a date? ...Nah, couldn&#39;t be. It was just a meeting between 
friends. Just somewhere to go, something to do, and somebody to do it 
with, that&#39;s all.

............

Meanwhile, Abigail Keeping had definitely asked her lover Hitomi Madsen 
out on a date. They were going to meet in a nice little restaurant 
called Anima, a place that served both Mexican and Italian dishes. Abby 
said that it would be a formal date, so she and Hitomi were going to 
play dress-up again, just as they had done on their first date, so long 
ago. Gosh&#151;had it really been five months since they started seriously 
dating? It seemed longer. Maybe the whole thing had been stretched out 
by their friendship of two years. Yeah, that felt about right: two and a 
half years. It was, and it was not, quite a long period of time. Lots 
could happen in that span.

Abigail knew her &quot;Tomi-chan&quot; would be rendered speechless no matter what 
she wore&#151;or did not wear&#151;but she wanted to look extra nice for tonight 
anyway. She thickened her long lashes, shaved and waxed her legs 
artistically, had her nails manicured, applied that special 
lilac-scented lipstick &quot;Tomi-chan&quot; liked kissing so much, and pinned her 
long, wavy black hair up, giving her Romanian face a slightly more 
western look. She wore a stark-white blouse that zipped (buttons were so 
aggravating during foreplay), her standard black skirt (this one rode 
just a bit higher), and put little emerald jewels in her ears to match 
her eyes. A dab here, a touch-up there, a big breath in between, 
and...showtime!

R-ring! Rr-rring! That was her.

When Abby opened the door, though, she was shocked.

&quot;Oh my Lord!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;Tomi, oh Tomi! What on Earth have you 
done!?&quot;

&quot;What? You don&#39;t like it?&quot; Abby pouted and cautiously reached out to 
cling the horribly sheared remains of her Tomi-chan&#39;s hair.

&quot;You cut it!&quot; she wailed, combing through the short strands delicately. 
&quot;God, Hitomi, that hair was your prize! Why the heck did you do that, 
sweetheart?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; said Madsen with a chuckle. She reached up and smoothed what her 
lover had weaved through, and gave her a coy expression. &quot;Abs, relax; 
it&#39;s just hair. If you miss it that much, I&#39;ll grow it out. I 
just...felt like a change was in order.&quot;

&quot;But you no longer look so Japanese,&quot; pouted the psychology teacher, 
more disappointed than she was sad. Madsen laughed and hugged the poor 
woman. Cutting her hair short was her decision, and she thought she 
looked spiffy. She didn&#39;t realize that her lover, a woman who herself 
sported an impressive mane, would be so upset about this change. She 
calmed down, though, smiled sadly, and focused on Hitomi&#39;s eyes instead.

&quot;Sweetheart, you know I&#39;ll always love you no matter what, it&#39;s just 
that...&quot;

&quot;...Just that what, dear?&quot; Abby blushed, now taciturn. She looked away 
and whispered her dread to Madsen.

&quot;It&#39;s just that...when we make love, your hair won&#39;t tickle my chest 
anymore. And I liked that part.&quot; Madsen laughed out loud, gave her lover 
an embrace, and kissed her cute pouty lips.

&quot;Well then, I guess you&#39;ll just have to be on top for a few months.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not the same,&quot; she murmured. Hitomi smiled sweetly and gave the 
dear a more deeper kiss.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m sorry. I really thought you&#39;d like it. Guess I still have a 
lot to learn about you, don&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she answered, &quot;but all the days of our lives to do it.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, no soap opera references, please. The school&#39;s nutty enough as it 
is. So, you ready?&quot;

&quot;Of course. Lead the way, you sexy little skinhead.&quot; Hitomi giggled, and 
yelped just a bit as Abby gave her a whap on the bottom. Oh, was she 
going to have sweet retribution for that!

............

Blue skies, depth of God&#39;s fathoms

Slinking by like the graves of lost angels

Withstand another mighty thunderbolt,

Know that beauty and deceit are one

Filtering the sky with black binds of softest wind.

Keep you there down by the bay of whistling words,

Gulls flock south, fly over, sit down.

There is a place I know, full of light and sorrow

Where troubles go to be intertwined with their destinies.

Form and shape of the mind, six strings on the highway

Everlasting truth, marching forth with an axe

To carve up the remains of what we all once knew.

Red, the color of violence.

Green, the color of life.

Breathe in me the Yuletide flavor, and

Let ambivalence take care of the rest.

Situation is now in hand.

&quot;And you wrote this by yourself?&quot; said May, looking over the paper. 
Janine smiled.

&quot;Yeah. Course, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s deep or just nonsensical. I was 
really going for a &#145;blah&#39; kind of feel to it, like I was going crazy.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s kind of beautiful,&quot; admitted May as she handed it back. &quot;Want to 
read mine?&quot;

&quot;You brought it with you?&quot;

&quot;You brought yours.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well...I wanted you to read it.&quot; She was flustered, May could 
tell. Pride bound next to anxiety. May smiled and gave Janine her poem.

I think I shall go to the store

I pray to myself it&#39;s no bore

Proud as I am of my fitting tie,

I know in my heart it can only lie

My feet move with independence yet,

The train of thought is still not set

Will it derail, I fear, before I reach my goal?

Or will it come safely to the station and oh,

I wish some things went faster: my feet,

Their speed succeeds over my mind, defeat.

I go through the door, wonder where I should go,

Infinite places, but only a second to choose.

&quot;I call it &#145;Confusion&#39;,&quot; Tramble announced. Janine made a face.

&quot;I can see why.&quot;

&quot;Give me that!&quot; she snapped playfully, yanking the paper away. Bautista 
laughed, then sighed. There, in the back of her mind&#151;a twitch, a twinge, 
a twist if you will. Take your shirt off. You silly fool, you wore your 
bikini just in case you changed your mind. It&#39;s a warm enough day, so 
why not? May&#39;s practically ogling you anyway. Give her something she can 
really drool about&#151;

&quot;How much time did you say you had?&quot; asked Janine, who&#39;d do anything to 
think of something else. May shrugged.

&quot;All day. But I can&#39;t stay out late.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, school.&quot;

Twitch-twinge-twist.

May all of a sudden wanted to kiss Janine.

Stop it, I&#39;m not gay.

Sigh.

&quot;It&#39;s not that bad, is it?&quot; said Bautista, noticing her friend&#39;s long 
face. May cringed.

&quot;Uh, no, I wasn&#39;t thinking about school. I was actually, uh...thinking 
about the elephant that found its way into our room.&quot;

&quot;The what?&quot;

&quot;You ever heard the term &#145;the elephant in the room&#39;? Where people will 
talk about everything except the obvious? I think it&#39;s time we mentioned 
the elephant.&quot; And with that, a flicker of bravery: May held Janine&#39;s 
hand. They both knew what that meant.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; said Janine, drawing in a deep breath. &quot;But not here, okay? 
Let&#39;s go somewhere else.&quot;

&quot;Private?&quot; If it was possible, Janine might&#39;ve blushed mentally. A 
private place with May? She was afraid she&#39;d do 
something...inappropriate.

Afraid...and excited.

Stop it, I&#39;m not gay. And neither is she.

&quot;Oh, um, not a good idea? Well...I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t wanna hang around a 
public place either. I really don&#39;t want this conversation to be 
overheard.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, me neither. Let&#39;s sit over at that bench.&quot; May noticed an 
isolated part of the park that had several empty, worn-out benches 
adorned here and there. It looked a little too secluded for her taste, 
but at least they wouldn&#39;t be tempted to do anything...improper. Her 
hand lifted itself up from Janine&#39;s grasp, and the two made the journey 
across endless fields of grass, now fully awake from their long cold 
slumber.

............

There was a piece by Bach trickling through the restaurant as Abby and 
Hitomi wove their way to their seats, but neither woman could identify 
it off the top of their heads. It was certainly no fugue, at least.

&quot;Sarah would know,&quot; Abby stated as they sat down&#151;or rather, Hitomi 
pulled out a chair for her. Keeping grinned and sat, staring not at her 
lover&#39;s cleavage as she was sometimes prone to do (hey, even she had her 
weak moments), but her shortened hair. As Hitomi sat, it ruffled a 
little around her ears. Abby grew a soft, kind smile, and tilted her 
head to look at her beloved in a new light.

&quot;You know, now that I really look at it, it does make you look good. I 
can&#39;t quite say if it&#39;s sexy or cute or pretty, but it&#39;s nice. I like 
it. But that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t be happy to have that long luscious 
chest-tickling hair of yours back either.&quot; The two chuckled softly, and 
called up glasses of water and a bottle of Chardonnay. Then they skimmed 
their menus, peeking at this and that idly, like cows deciding which 
plot of land to chew up. Abby checked the low-fat section&#151;she wasn&#39;t 
exactly the lean mean figure she once was, and wanted to hold onto this 
reasonable, womanly weight as long as possible. Wretched Hitomi, on the 
other hand, could have anything she wanted and not feel guilty. The 
little fox barely tipped 100 on the scale.

&quot;I really wish I had your body,&quot; Abby sighed longingly. Without peering 
away from the menu, Hitomi showed utmost intrigue.

&quot;Oh? And do you mean that physically, or...sexually?&quot;

&quot;Both,&quot; Abby giggled. &quot;Tomi-chan&quot; grinned.

&quot;We&#39;ll get to that later. I think I&#39;ll have...the Tuscan Salad with the 
soup of the day. You?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still deciding.&quot; But inwardly, Damn! That sure does look good! 
She&#39;s got really great tastes. I can&#39;t order what she has...can I? It&#39;s 
a special occasion; I should have something sensible. ...Hmm, Santa Fe 
chicken. All right, I&#39;ll bite. What the hey; you&#39;re only in this 
position once. When they were ready, they placed their orders and smiled 
at each other, savoring that great golden period between the time of 
ordering and the time of receiving. Ahh, the joys of conversation...

About eighteen minutes passed, and with it the music. It was now Mozart.

&quot;Tomi-chan,&quot; Abby said as she sipped her water, &quot;I have to pull a Mia 
Wallace on you and powder my nose. Will you be a dear and wait to eat 
for me if the food should come quickly?&quot;

&quot;Of course. I wouldn&#39;t be a lady if I didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Abby smiled and toddled off to the women&#39;s restroom, where she 
stopped in front of a mirror for a long time, contemplating herself and 
her relationship with the beauty called Hitomi. Two years...and five 
months of dating, not counting that dry spell of theirs. Was she ready 
for the next step? They had overcome friendship, overcome romance, 
overcome sex, even the brief separation and reunion. Now they were 
solid, and Abby thought that this was the time, just before May and the 
end of the semester, to bring things up to the next plateau. She had 
asked Hitomi to come to Anima for a reason&#151;now she was going to fulfill 
that reason.

As she made sure everything looked all right, another lady came out of 
one of the stalls, a slightly older blonde who looked serious and 
intellectual. She gave Keeping a civil smile and started washing her 
hands. Abby ignored her and sighed deeply.

&quot;I&#39;m a little nervous,&quot; she said out of the blue. The blonde gave her a 
smile of support.

&quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;I came all this way for a special moment in my life. I&#39;m with my 
sweetheart now, and we...we&#39;ve been strong together for quite some time 
now. I told myself that I would do something extra special today, and so 
I&#39;m a little nervous.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; She looked faintly interested, like if Abby had told her she won 
fifty dollars in the lottery. &quot;Well, it happens. The important thing to 
do is just to do it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; Abby then grinned, faced this total stranger, and told 
her the secret. &quot;Um, actually...I&#39;m going to ask my lover to marry me 
tonight&#151;right here in this restaurant.&quot;

&quot;Oh really!&quot; This brightened the blonde&#39;s mood, and she gave Abby a 
sweet smile. &quot;That&#39;s really wonderful, and so romantic! It&#39;s refreshing 
to see a woman asking a man to marry her.&quot; Abby grinned bashfully, not 
quite sure how to break the news to this nice lady. Best to just be 
honest.

&quot;Um, actually, I&#39;m not asking a man to marry me. My lover&#39;s another 
woman. Uh...I hope you don&#39;t have any problems with that!&quot; The blonde&#39;s 
smile froze, then faded just enough that Abby could tell she did. But 
then it returned, and the enthusiasm along with it.

&quot;...Oh. Oh. Well, uh, I&#39;m sorry for assuming, but...you know.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, I understand. ...She is a really wonderful lady.&quot;

&quot;She must be,&quot; mused the blonde, &quot;if you&#39;re telling a perfect stranger 
about it.&quot;

&quot;I know!&quot; Abby laughed, then showed her &quot;new friend&quot; the ring. With her 
salary, it was a miracle she could afford the box, let alone the jewel. 
But Hitomi was worth it. A few extra words of support and best wishes 
later, Keeping parted ways with the blonde, walked out of the bathroom, 
and made her way to her table, where Madsen was patiently waiting for 
her. The dinner, unfortunately, was not.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Madsen shrugged. &quot;Unlike Mia Wallace, your food was not here 
for you when you arrived.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

I had something much better here anyway.

............

&quot;Look, let&#39;s be reasonable about this,&quot; spoke May after a thick, awkward 
pause. &quot;I mean, I&#39;m going to be eighteen soon, and you&#39;re sixteen. We&#39;re 
not kids, so let&#39;s handle this like adults.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot;

&quot;No running away, no denial, nothing of that sort. And if we get scared, 
well...let&#39;s wait until we&#39;re comfortable to confront the problem 
again.&quot;

&quot;Agreed. So should I start?&quot;

&quot;If you want.&quot; Janine took a deep breath. It was such a beautiful day...

&quot;I&#39;m scared, May,&quot; she admitted. &quot;When I&#39;m around you as a friend, I 
enjoy myself. We haven&#39;t known each other long, but you&#39;re already as 
close to me as the others are. I think of you as one of my best friends. 
But...when we get...intimate, it scares me to death. Like...when we 
kissed for the school musical, and every other time following that. I 
mean, I&#39;ve got no problem giving you a little peck here and there, it&#39;s 
just that...when it lingers...I get scared.&quot;

&quot;Do you...I mean, are you afraid you might become gay?&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s not that,&quot; Janine whispered. &quot;I don&#39;t even think I would really 
mind if it were just that easy. But it&#39;s not. It&#39;s like, every time 
we&#39;re intimate, I feel a part of my own identity is being lost. Like I&#39;m 
trading part of my soul for all those kisses.&quot;

&quot;So...is that why you&#39;re scared?&quot;

&quot;A-huh.&quot; Janine gave a watery smile and rubbed her legs, feeling the 
roughness of the denim. She had never told anybody that little secret 
except May&#151;the rest of her friends thought she was just in denial. 
&quot;Plus,&quot; she added bashfully, &quot;when I was a first-year student at 
Stanton, this older girl came onto me in the worst way. I don&#39;t like to 
admit it, but I think a part of me enjoyed it. I mean, yeah, it was a 
sensual experience, but...it was with a girl. So I got scared and ran 
off, literally. I think after that moment, I would just get frightened 
if I saw other girls doing that. And lucky me, enrolling in an all-girls 
school.&quot; She chuckled dryly, but looked so depressed that May wished she 
could comfort her friend without it feeling weird.

&quot;May I ask a question?&quot; she said. Janine nodded. &quot;Did you ever 
think...you might be scared of it because you enjoyed it?&quot; Janine looked 
over, silent. She expected this one to pop up, but May spoke with 
kindness, not in the lewd tone her friends usually carried.

&quot;The thought did pass my mind,&quot; she admitted. Her voice was now tight, 
strained, unsure. Not-Janine, in other words. &quot;Sometimes I thought I 
did. I...think I was afraid to be gay, like you said, but I was also 
afraid of losing my identity. If I...turned out to be like that after 
all, and not the great straight little girl I thought I was, then...I 
don&#39;t think I could&#39;ve handled it. You know...homosexuality isn&#39;t 
received very well in this world. But it&#39;s not even that. Aside from all 
the names, all the stereotypes, all the mocking and the leering, I was 
afraid of the mystery of it all. I didn&#39;t know what made people do that, 
and I didn&#39;t know why so many people thought it was wrong, and I didn&#39;t 
know why, to this day, some people shudder or wince just by the name of 
it. If I tell someone I have a boyfriend, they smile. If I tell them I&#39;m 
gay, they give me that look. You know the one.&quot;

Yes, May did. She knew the look well. June got it all the time. But she 
seemed happy even with her lot in life, and whether being a lesbian was 
really inherited through genes or a decision of hers, she seemed content 
no matter what&#151;truly &quot;gay&quot; in the ultimate sense. But Janine wasn&#39;t 
June, and May wasn&#39;t June. Nobody was June except for June Rhea Tramble, 
so Janine and May could only account for themselves. They had to figure 
things out on their own.

&quot;Janine,&quot; said May quietly, &quot;I think I better say something too. Over 
the months we&#39;ve known each other, I have grown fond of you. I didn&#39;t 
think I&#39;d have any friends in my senior year, but I guess fate and Miss 
Madsen had different ideas. And when you say we&#39;re close, I agree. I 
really love you, in the sorority sense. And at times I thought I was 
even attracted to you. I&#39;ll admit,&quot; she added with a chuckle, &quot;sometimes 
I did enjoy kissing you. I thought I was gay, like my sister, and if 
that sort of thing is genetic, I guess I really am. I say it&#39;s a choice, 
but...what do I know? I&#39;m no expert. I just......yeah, it&#39;s confusing. A 
lot of nonsense. Why anyone would want to choose that way of life is 
beyond me, but...again, what do I know?

&quot;I&#39;ve got a point,&quot; she noted&#151;&quot;somewhere.&quot; The two laughed quietly, and 
May took Janine&#39;s hand in her own again. They didn&#39;t do anything else, 
they just held onto each other&#39;s fingers quietly. &quot;We sure do have a lot 
of things to sort out, don&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, definitely! But...it&#39;s good we can talk. I&#39;d hate to feel awkward 
around you. Maybe I was also scared of that. Look at me, a big 
coward...&quot; The two laughed&#151;Janine could poke fun at herself without 
feeling glum about it&#151;and purely on impulse, May kissed Janine&#39;s cheek. 
The two were silent afterwards, not knowing whether they had ruined or 
strengthened their relationship with that gesture. Janine turned her 
head around to face the older woman, and for a moment, her mind was 
clear. She leaned over and, by her own free will, pressed her lips 
softly against May&#39;s mouth, keeping them there for a good four or five 
seconds. When they pulled away, there didn&#39;t seem to be any 
friction&#151;yet.

&quot;Well,&quot; managed a nervous Bautista, &quot;I think we&#39;ve made progress. Or 
maybe we&#39;ve just went around in circles. What&#39;s the status of our 
relationship again?&quot; May laughed out loud, and gave her dear friend a 
hug, blessed fool.

&quot;Oh, best friends, at the least&#151;at the least!&quot;

&quot;Sure, why not?&quot; Janine whispered, her face very close to May&#39;s. She 
smiled tenderly and rubbed her nose against the older girl&#39;s cheek, 
until both their noses were together and kissing softly. May sighed 
dreamily, closed her eyes, and leaned forward to take Janine&#39;s soft 
heavenly lips into her own; her hair was just as soft, delicate and 
smooth.

But Janine pulled away soon, a little red in the face.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she breathed, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;

&quot;No, sorry, it&#39;s my fault. Once again we get carried away.&quot; Bautista 
rolled her eyes and sighed, placing her head on her friend&#39;s shoulder, 
feigning agony.

&quot;We&#39;re not dykes, are we?&quot; May giggled and shoved her friend back up.

&quot;No, of course not! At least I&#39;m not. I&#39;m not so sure about you, missy!&quot;

&quot;Me?! You&#39;re the one who rubbed my nose! I was just gonna give you a 
little peck on the cheek!&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah, but......you started it!&quot;

&quot;Nuh-uh!&quot;

&quot;Yuh-huh!&quot; A pause. Then, laughter.

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re really acting like adults here.&quot;

It was getting late, so May volunteered to drive Janine home. The 
younger woman thought there was still some issues they needed to cover, 
so she didn&#39;t quite get out of the car just yet. May parked out by the 
street, next to the Bautista mailbox, and rolled the windows down before 
shutting the engine off. The late April night air was a bit cool, but 
hardly unbearable. The two girls made their way to the backseat so 
they&#39;d have a more comfortable place to speak.

&quot;Something on your mind?&quot; said May. Janine looked over and took a 
breath.

&quot;Ahh...no, not really. I just thought we had some other problems to go 
over, but we can do that another time. It&#39;s late.&quot;

&quot;Oh? You don&#39;t strike me as the procrastinating type.&quot;

&quot;Well, usually I&#39;m not,&quot; she smirked. &quot;But sometimes!&quot; The girls 
grinned&#151;and that seemed to be it. Their conversation was effectively 
dead and buried. Nothing to do now but...nothing? Janine couldn&#39;t just 
sit in May&#39;s car all night and do nothing, but she stayed behind, as if 
something was weighing her down, keeping her there...

&quot;Janine?&quot; whispered May, looking directly at her. She could feel her 
heart thudding nervously, and her palms started to sweat. Uh-oh. That 
was trouble.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; she whispered back. Scoot, scoot&#151;May was closer.

&quot;Um...can...&quot; She didn&#39;t go any further than that. Just...dead, right 
there. She raised her hand and placed it on the younger woman&#39;s jaw, and 
two pairs of brown eyes stared at each other across the tiny chasm. A 
bridge was soon formed, first from a timid blossom, then into a 
beautiful flower. Janine closed her eyes and touched May&#39;s face, 
brushing back the long dark hair she had grown out (now effectively 
making her resemble her twin all the more), and let their bridge linger, 
strengthen, and solidify.

The kiss was long, deep, and too meaningful to have been fake. This was 
no act; that had been a real kiss. Another began as soon as this one 
ended, sweet and soft&#151;then another, two mouths inhaling the scent and 
flavor of each other. Another, another, another, several passionate ones 
in succession. They could no longer find the strength or willpower to 
stop themselves, so absorbed were they in the rosy embraces of each 
other. They continued&#151;kiss, kiss&#151;until slowly, they&#151;kiss, kiss&#151;drifted 
away, their russet eyes burning gently. There was no fear.

&quot;Hey May,&quot; Janine whispered, forgetting her friend hated that. She 
ignored it.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Remember what we did at New Year&#39;s?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah.&quot; A cute, shy smile came.

&quot;Y&#39;wanna do it again?&quot;

&quot;...Sure.&quot; For awhile, nothing happened. They were lost in the auburn 
labyrinth. Then, their lips met again, opening slowly to gasp the 
moistness of each other. A slick tongue crept out, touching another; the 
two interacted and felt one another, sensing for danger 
or...companionship. Janine slid her tongue through, past May&#39;s lips and 
into her mouth, invading with a welcome moan. May&#39;s tongue embraced the 
slippery moist pink dart inside its home; it curled around, touching and 
tasting until it decided to softly fight back, and slipped through its 
defenses into Janine&#39;s mouth. The tender pink explorer touched the damp 
cavern with utmost serenity, and was pulled back to safety by the 
original inhabitant, where the two embraced again and, in little time, 
made sweet love together.

In short, Janine Bautista and May Tramble Frenched each other stupid.

Without ever realizing it, Janine put her hands beneath May&#39;s 
short-sleeved shirt and had lifted it off in a moment. But even then she 
was uncontrollable, and went after the older girl with a renewed frenzy, 
now feeling naked skin and the delicate undergarment clasped over it. 
Her head swam with dizziness as she felt her own shirt being removed, 
and the two resumed kissing, touching, sighing softly with a single 
breath, their bodies now touching with a new, sharp, electric feel.

Janine finally let May have some air, but only to briefly pin her down. 
There was now no question: she leered at the girl with lust in her eyes. 
May had girl&#39;s khakis on, but not for long, and soon Janine was in her 
underwear as well. After that...oh, after that, a labyrinth became the 
least of their worries; they were soon totally lost in the maze of 
Other, of Not-Me, of something else too wonderful to abandon. May held 
Janine and left no boundary uncrossed&#151;and tumbled most ungraciously when 
she attempted to gain a dominant hand. Janine&#39;s head bumped up against 
the door&#39;s handle, shaking her out of her madness. She grunted and let 
out a soft laugh; May just beamed.

&quot;Oh, sorry! Did you hurt yourself?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, your...doors are vicious!&quot; She smiled merrily and rubbed her 
wounded noggin&#151;then, as if waking from a dream, noticed that she and her 
friend were almost naked. And they had been making out rather 
passionately. Oh dear.

&quot;Wow, we really fogged the whole place up,&quot; said May, noticing the 
ghostly residue on her car&#39;s windows. She smiled at her companion, 
heedless to her own semi-nudity, and added, &quot;Good thing I rolled down 
the windows, or we&#39;d suffocate!&quot;

&quot;...Uh, yeah...&quot; Uh-oh. May knew that look. Janine was starting to get 
scared. She smiled sadly, cursing her ineptitude. They had been so close 
to...

Wait a minute! Am I regretting the fact that we didn&#39;t go all the 
way?!!? Oh my gosh...am I really a...

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Did I break our moment?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; answered the other, smiling softly. &quot;But that&#39;s all right. 
I&#39;m glad. We shouldn&#39;t have done that. ...Sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. Uh...here are your clothes.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; They stiffly dressed, not saying a word. They had to struggle 
to fit into their jeans and khakis, but the awkwardness of the moment 
made everything ten times more unbearable. They said nothing as they 
both got out of the car, but May knew she couldn&#39;t leave it like that.

&quot;Hey, Janine, uh...just out of curiosity, were you scared at any time?&quot; 
Bautista frowned in thought. Could she really be honest with herself, or 
with May?

&quot;Right now? Yeah. I was frightened back then. But not while we were 
kissing. I wasn&#39;t scared then.&quot;

............

They had just finished their main course, and dessert would be along 
shortly, so now seemed like a good time. In front of the entire Anima 
clientele, Abigail Marie Keeping knelt down and gave a modest proposal.

&quot;Hitomi Leah Madsen, will you marry me?&quot;

And, through tears and choked words, Hitomi managed to answer her love.

&quot;...Yes!!!&quot;</pre>
