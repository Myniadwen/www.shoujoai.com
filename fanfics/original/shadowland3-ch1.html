<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 1 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Melissa, Head Mistress of Whispering Hills Academy for Lost Souls&#39; 
Western Wing, burst through the immense oak double doors of the Hall of 
Candles and down the long stone corridor. Flicking light shone all 
around, from thousands of candles held high upon hundreds of tall brass 
candelabrums that rose to either side of the hall. Even the multitude of 
candles did nothing to improve the dismal demeanour of this resting 
place for the dead. Melissa to move down the corridor with such veracity 
as to cause many of the candles flames to flicker from their spots a top 
never melding candlesticks, if the candles could be snuffed out by 
normal means then many of them would be vanished in the woman&#39;s path. 

Anger in her eyes Melissa kept her sight on the large double doors at 
the far end of the hall, never once glancing out the stone framed 
windows with their iron grid glass panes at the spiralling purples mixed 
with the darkness of the world outside the Halls, a land where only 
those who have recently passed on, and those of supernatural origin, may 
journey. She had no interest in the spiralling darkness for she had 
pressing business with a family member that she would rather not be 
seeing. The very image of her brother-in-law&#39;s masked face made her skin 
crawl, but years ago when he offered her the job overseeing the lost 
souls of Whispering Hills and she was more then willing to follow his 
orders, if it meant helping just one of those girls, however after 
recent events she was finding herself questioning her brother&#39;s methods 
and as such wished to wash her hands of the whole business. 

As she approached the inner doors that lead from the Hall to the central 
sanctum of Death&#39;s Corridor, the place where the Sisters of Death 
resided, a group of nine Death Angels, the arched oak doors began to 
swing outward on their brass hinges as if in anticipation of Melissa&#39;s 
arrival and a cloaked figure stepped through the doors. The person 
pulled back their dark grey hood to reveal the face of a fair skinned 
woman in her early twenties with long, silken, black hair that rolled 
down her shoulders and was parted to the side, the left side tucked 
behind her ear. A long curved black tattoo, the shape of an upside down 
shark&#39;s fin, cut across the left side of her face starting at her hair 
line, through her eye and ending at point on her cheek. The woman smiled 
warmly at the headmistress and nodded to her in greeting. 

&quot;Aunt Missy, it has been such a long time, it is good to see you again.&quot; 
The woman greeted the Head Mistress with a small bow.

&quot;You too Julie.&quot; Melissa forced herself to smile, only those closest to 
the woman were allowed to call Melissa by her nickname and at that 
moment she was not please with hearing her niece refer to her in such a 
personal level, but kept her venous tongue at bay for the time being. 
She straightened her back as to give off an air of authority, even 
though she was merely an inch taller then the Death Angel, nearly the 
same age and held very little authority inside these halls. She might 
have been one of the Lords of Shadow, but her refusal to partake in the 
rituals of the Lords placed her, and her twin sister, rather low on the 
chain of command. She was actually lucky her brother gave her such a 
propionate and important job as he did, she know that he did not give 
her the job because of her skills, in fact, knowing The Meanderer he had 
some secret agenda in asking her to run the Academy with her sister and 
this was one of the reasons she wish to speak with the man. She hated 
being left in the dark and felt used. She despised her brother&#39;s ability 
to see events that have yet to come, but then again he was the Lord of 
Coincidence after all so it was expected of him, yet even have several 
thousand years she had yet to get used to his ways. The way he 
manipulated events at his whim bothered her to no end and she needed to 
finally put an end to her part in his schemes once and for all. 

&quot;I need to see your Father.&quot; She half ordered the Death Angel, combing 
her own long black hair with her fingers and tucking it behind her ear 
in the same fashion as the younger woman.

Julie smiled and gestured to the doors, &quot;Father is not here right now, 
but he left you a package, it is with Milai.&quot; She said politely. 

Melissa frowned, &quot;I should have known as much, is there anything that 
man doesn&#39;t know?&quot; She inquired rhetorically as she passed through the 
doors into a massive circular room with millions of candles covering 
curved elevated wooden stairs from floor to ceiling, leaving only the 
several doors free of candle wax, making the room appear to be more of 
an auditorium then a place for the records of the dead. In the centre of 
the room stood a grand podium on raises with spiralling steps around it, 
making it tower over the room, an immense book at least a metre long and 
over half a metre thick sat upon the podium while many more similar 
books, bound in cracked, worn, dark leather, lay upon the ground stacked 
to a person&#39;s height and forcing any who enter the centre of the room to 
have to carefully weave their way through the maze of books in order to 
reach any of the doors exiting the room, or the podium itself. A tall 
man peered over the book atop the podium to look down at the new 
arrivals, his face small at such a great height.  

&quot;Aunt Melissa.&quot; The greeted the woman in a deep cheerful voice. He 
circled around the podium to reveal a long dark flowing robe and long 
straight locks of hair that almost melted into the man&#39;s cloak, which in 
turn appeared to be made of the very shadows around him. A white 
porcelain mask set upon the man&#39;s long face and a single green eye 
peered out from the slits in the mask, a smile could be seen at the 
corners of the man&#39;s face through the eyehole, &quot;I&#39;ve been expecting 
you.&quot; He said as he circled around the spiralling stairs and wove his 
way through the many books toward the woman, standing almost eight feet 
in height his head could be see floating over the books as he travelled.

&quot;I thought as much, Milai.&quot; Melissa said with a sigh, trying hard to 
keep the edge from her cutting through her voice. Out of all her 
brother&#39;s children Milai was one of the few that she didn&#39;t feel 
distaste towards. She actually loved all her nieces and nephew, but 
after recent events at the school she could not help feeling malice 
towards the Sister of Death and yet Milai was no Death Angel. He was 
something else entirely, charged with keeping track of the records of 
the dead this man has a lonely existence and unlike his sisters he does 
not get a chance to leave the Hall of Candles much. Milai was known as 
the Lord of Things to Come and Melissa need not say a single word 
without before the man read her very expressions and as such he faltered 
upon setting his eyes set on her face and she could see a frown appear 
in those eyes, this made her realize that her anger was indeed very 
visible to this godlike being. She wiped at her face in an attempt to 
rub any sign of her true emotions from her face and looked back up at 
her nephew, &quot;I came seeking your father, but I suspect he is avoiding me 
so I cannot resign.&quot; 

Milai lowered his head, &quot;I feared my intuitions were true.&quot; He lifted 
his head to peer at the woman through long strains of hair that fell in 
his face, &quot;I must ask, what would you achieve by abandoning the lost 
souls of Whispering Hills?&quot; He asked solemnly.  

Melissa let out a deep sign and fiddled with a lock of her own hair. She 
did not wish to bring up her resignation to her nephew, but knew that 
there was no way to hide anything from him, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I...&quot; She 
looked up at her nephew with pain filled eyes, &quot;I can&#39;t stand seeing 
them like this and not being able to do anything to help them.&quot; She 
explained sadly. 

Julie set a hand upon her aunt&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I know how you feel, but you 
have to let them deal with things on their own.&quot; 

Melissa spun around to face the Sister of Death, glaring at her, &quot;How 
would you know?&quot; She could not contain her disgust for the girl any 
longer, &quot;Your job is simple, just gather the souls of those who have 
died of old age and lost their way, which rarely happens because those 
who die of old age are usually read to die so you just sit around here. 
What is so hard about that?&quot; 

Julie shook her head in disagreement, &quot;I&#39;m not talking about the job as 
a Death Sister, but the one that I took on after my mother&#39;s death, your 
sister. To act as mother to my younger sisters and protect them at all 
cost. It pains me so to see them suffering and not being able to do 
anything to relieve that pain.&quot; 

Melissa&#39;s glares intensified, &quot;If that were true then you would not have 
abandoned your own sister like that. Do you have any idea how much it is 
killing her knowing that her own sisters want nothing to do with her? I 
know what she did was against the rules, but screw your bloody rules. 
Have you ever thought that it was those very rules that are the problem? 
Maybe you should stop worrying about your stupid rules and start 
thinking with your bloody heart, or have you been collecting souls for 
so long that you&#39;ve forgotten what it means to care for someone so 
deeply that you would do anything for them, even sacrifice your own 
existence in order to protect them.&quot; 

Julie stepped up to the woman, &quot;You have no right to talk to me that 
way. You have no idea that things I have done to be there for my 
sisters.&quot; She said in defence. 

Melissa slammed a fist upon one of the lower stacks of books at her 
side, &quot;I very well know all about what you consider help!&quot; She growled, 
&quot;So you allowed Kris to acquire a Malith stone, if you had stopped Carey 
in the first place then she wouldn&#39;t need that stone, hell if you had 
spoke up against your father when he banished her she wouldn&#39;t have to 
fight these never-ending battles on her own.&quot; She screamed, tears 
building up at the corners of her eyes as all her rage began to spill 
forth, &quot;Where were you when she was struggling with questions about 
love? What about when she was questioning her own sexuality, Huh? I know 
where you were and it was as sure as hell not at her side, because I was 
the one sitting on the side of her bed as she cried into my arms, 
wanting nothing more then to not exist because she felt she only caused 
everyone more pain. I was the one putting her back together after you 
tossed her out so don&#39;t talk to me about how much you have suffered.&quot;

Julie recoiled at her Aunts anger and lowered her eyes to the ground in 
shame. 

&quot;While you are here feeling proud of yourself for helping today.&quot; 
Melissa continued, &quot;What about all the years that you weren&#39;t there? 
What about that?&quot;  

Milai silently moved through the piles of books until he finally arrived 
at the women&#39;s side and placed a leather-gloved hand upon his aunt&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;Calm yourself Aunt.&quot; He said in a calming voice that made the 
anger melt from Melissa as she gazed up at the man&#39;s masked face, &quot;I 
know how you feel, but take it out on the proper soul.&quot; He glanced up at 
the pained look on his sister&#39;s face, &quot;Julie punishes herself enough 
that you do not need to enforce more pain upon her. I see the guilt in 
her heart everyday and know this is not the path she chooses, it is the 
one she is forced to take.&quot; 

Melissa shook her head slowly, &quot;Everyone has a choice.&quot; She returned, 
&quot;Even the Lords.&quot; 

Milai glanced down at the woman and shook his head slowly, &quot;If that is 
true then I ask again, why are you abandoning those girls when they need 
you so?&quot; 

Melissa ran her hands through her hair and allowed it to fall in her 
face again, &quot;I have no clue.&quot; She admitted tiredly, &quot;I just feel so lost 
and exhausted. I want to help, but I&#39;m not even allowed to tell them the 
truth of their own existence and it hurts just seeing the look in their 
eyes every day.&quot; 

Milai squeezed her shoulder, &quot;Perhaps you should reconsider your 
resignation.&quot; He pulled a large brown envelope out from under his cloak 
and held it out to the woman, &quot;I know these new arrivals will be in need 
of your care more so now then ever.&quot; 

&quot;New arrivals?&quot; Melissa blinked at the packaged and suddenly 
understanding the message her brother-in-law had sent and shakily took 
it from the man. More lost souls were on their way and her sister was so 
weak that she would not be able to be there for them all, &quot;This can&#39;t 
be...&quot; She stated, refusing to believe what she was seeing, &quot;We are full 
up... how can he?&quot; She muttered as she took the envelope from her hands. 

&quot;Not any longer.&quot; Milai said dismally, &quot;It would appear that you have at 
least one opening, and will have more soon enough.&quot; 

Melissa glanced up at the man in shook, &quot;An opening? Who left? Did 
someone graduate... or...?&quot; She could not muster the strength to utter 
the thought that rose up in her mind. 

&quot;While you were away the young red head moved on.&quot; Milai explained 
softly. Melissa spun around to fast Julie and Milai squeezing the 
woman&#39;s shoulder in assurance, &quot;She is not dead, but she no longer 
exists in the matter that she once did.&quot; 

Melissa turned back to the man wide eyed, &quot;K... Kimberly...Harrison... 
or was it Ki... Kima?&quot; She inquired shakily as the faces of the 
mysterious twins with their fiery hair and eyes flickered to mind.

Milai tapped the envelope, &quot;You&#39;ll find the answers you seek in there.&quot; 
He explained simply.

Melissa shakily opened the envelope and pulled out several file folders. 
Upon opening the first one her jaw dropped in shock and she quickly 
glanced up at Milai, &quot;This girl... she can&#39;t be... is she?&quot; 

Milai shrugged, &quot;It is more then possible, but not even I know that 
answer.&quot; He replied dismally, &quot;All I know for certain is your sister is 
going to need you at the Academy and so are the girls there.&quot;

Melissa flipped through the many folders, glancing at the photos of the 
new girls,  &quot;Three... Four... Five... How... How are we supposed to 
house all these girls?&quot; 

Milai shook his head, &quot;Father just said to give you those files, he said 
you would figure things out. You should hurry because they should be 
arriving soon and I suspect that you are going to have your hands full 
soon.&quot; 

Melissa began to back towards the front door, her eyes flicking from the 
files to Milai, &quot;I...&quot; She glanced around the room at the other doors 
and her thoughts turned to her brother&#39;s masked face staring out from 
long dirty blonde bangs and she ground her teeth together. &quot;Tell your 
father I&#39;m not through with him. I&#39;m only returning because Sophia will 
need my help with these new girls and not because of him. I&#39;ll be back 
to have a word with him as soon as this is all sorted out.&quot; She stated 
firmly and opened the doors out of the room, &quot;It was nice seeing you 
again Milai, I will talk to you later.&quot; 

&quot;Until another day.&quot; Milai said with a slight bow, &quot;Take care of 
yourself Aunt Melissa.&quot; 

Julia waved at the woman, &quot;Take care, Aunt Missy.&quot; She said with a 
twitchy smile. 

Melissa glared at her niece, &quot;I&#39;m still not pleased with you. Maybe you 
should consider visiting your sister sometime. Gwen and Keelia dropped 
by and I know she would love to see her other sisters.&quot; She stepped 
through the door; &quot;I hope the next time I see you, you will act more 
like a big sister and less like a soldier of your fathers.&quot; Without 
another word she let the large door close behind her and rushed down the 
corridor out of The Hall of Candles. 

&quot;Well... that could have gone better.&quot; Julie sighed as she leaned 
against the door, &quot;She really hates us does she not?&quot; She asked her 
brother in dismay. 

Milai shook his head, &quot;She is understandably angry.&quot; He stated simply 
and turned at the sound of the door behind him. The door opened and yet 
another of his sisters entered the room, &quot;Morrigan? What brings you?&quot; He 
inquired curiously of the Death Angels arrival. 

Morrigan gazed around from under her hood with her sightless eyes, eyes 
that she herself had gouged out and sewn shut many years ago. Even with 
her eyes sealed she appeared to take in her ever surrounding and turned 
her head to face up at her brother. Her lips parted for the first time 
in many years and a cracked voice emitted, &quot;The Child of Dream...&quot; She 
said in a pained tone that only the ears of her brother could hear, for 
he too suffered from the same tragic events that left himself in a state 
similar to her&#39;s. 

He raised his gloved hand to stare at the nonexistent arm the held the 
glove aloft and clenched his nonexistent fist, causing the leather of 
the glove to creak and close into a fist. It had been such a long time 
since the day his limbs had been removed from his body and he became the 
floating disaster that he was today. He closed his eyes as he recalled 
that day and how that man tore his arms and lower body from him as his 
younger sisters looked on and then forced him to watch as the man 
taunted Morrigan until she finally tore out her own eyes with a 
fragments of glass she found on the ground near her. He was able to 
create a psychic version of his body and escape with his sister, not 
before sealing the man in an obsidian mirror, but the torture they 
endured affected their lives forever. 

&quot;Draigo.&quot; Milai muttered under his breath. 

Julie stepped up to her brother and glanced between him and her sister, 
&quot;Draigo? Has he returned? I thought you and Morrigan sealed him away all 
those years ago?&quot; 

&quot;If the Child of Dream has returned to the Realm of Shadows it is very 
likely that he will come seeking her.&quot; Milai remarked worriedly and 
looked over at Morrigan, who shook her head uneasily and clasped her 
arms about her waist, shaking uncontrollably, &quot;I suspect that Carey has 
been trying to free him and I hope that she never succeeds for if he 
does return he will do anything in his power to have that child in his 
possession and we can not allow that to happen, for if it does the all 
the Realms will become a Sea of Nightmares and no one will sleep soundly 
ever again.&quot; 

Julie stared at her brother in shock of what she was hearing. &quot;Wait! 
Could he be the reason for the resent stir of the Faceless and Dream 
Ghouls?&quot; She inquired as an unsettling feeling began to fill her. 

Milai nodded, &quot;It is most evident and they are probably searching for 
him as we speak.&quot; 

Julie glanced at the door her Aunt has just passed through and recalled 
the stories her younger sister, Gwen, had told her of the Stained Glass 
Angel&#39;s appearance in the Realm of Shadows, &quot;I... I have to talk to 
father.&quot; She quickly turned and started for the door to her left, &quot;There 
must be something we can do to help them.&quot; 

Milai placed a hand upon her shoulder, forcing the girl to stop in her 
tracks and glance up at him, &quot;We have already done what we can. 
Everything is set in motion and we can only wait and watch.&quot; He said 
helplessly, &quot;I have seen it and our intervention will only make matter&#39;s 
worse. Those girls need to face this on their own or they will forever 
be lost.&quot;

&quot;But we can not just sit around here.&quot; She glanced around at her 
siblings, &quot;Draigo is a demon and he will torture those girls just as he 
did the two of you.&quot; She explained weakly, knowing far to well that her 
brother was correct. If Draigo was able to do the kind of damage that he 
did to Milai and Morrigan, two of their father&#39;s more powerful children, 
then what could they do to protect those children. 

&quot;They have fought worse things in their own nightmares.&quot; Milai remarked, 
&quot;I think they will do just fine.&quot;
