<a href="../original/angelgift-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Allison puffed a relieved breath out as the shuttle set down in the bay, 
the force fields sealing off the inner chamber and air rushing in. 
&quot;Well, let&#39;s go in,&quot; she said, looking up at the tall woman standing 
beside her.

&quot;Of course, Prince-consort,&quot; Commander Laurel D&#39;ken said easily, her 
short blue hair barely ruffled by the slight breeze of the internal air 
transfer systems.

&quot;That&#39;s going to take some getting used to,&quot; Allison muttered, the sandy 
haired woman tugging at her new uniform. The black jacket and pants fit 
smoothly, the glossy boots tapping against the alloy floor. &quot;Is the 
title really neccessary?&quot; she asked plaintively.

&quot;Jenna insisted,&quot; Laurel shrugged.

&quot;Guess I&#39;m stuck,&quot; Allison smiled wryly. &quot;Thanks for lending me these,&quot; 
she added as they went into the docking bay.

&quot;Considering it&#39;s my fault your other clothes were soiled,&quot; Laurel 
replied following her respectfully, &quot;it was no trouble.&quot;

The twelve foot tall and nearly twice as long shuttle settled down, the 
landing struts extending as it dropped to the floor. The engineering 
module was the largest part of the ship, the vehicle tapering off to a 
pointed nose-cone. Wing surfaces stretched out on each side, coupled 
with weapons mounts on the top and bottom of the slim vessel. The access 
ramp quickly dropped down, then a group of figures exploded out of the 
craft.

&quot;Allison?&quot; Sharin blinked, the blonde haired amazonian leading the 
charge out of the shuttle only to skid to a stop in front of the two 
women.

&quot;Where&#39;s Jenna?&quot; Milly demanded, the redheaded catgirl glaring around.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Amara waved at Allison casually.

Marilyn and Roma noticed the Commander and stiffened, saluting. &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; 
Marilyn said, the blue haired officer looking like she was going to 
faint from excitement, &quot;Galactic Patrol agents Marilyn and Roma, 
reporting!&quot;

&quot;At ease,&quot; Laurel waved casually.

&quot;So cool,&quot; Kat blinked, looking around in awe.

&quot;Jenna&#39;s fine,&quot; Allison reassured Milly and Sharin, holding her hands in 
front of her as she continued, &quot;she sent me down to bring you to the 
bridge.&quot;

Milly frowned, &quot;They&#39;re trying to force her to go back to the Empire?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Allison shook her head adding, &quot;it seems this ship has 
been assigned to Jenna for her personal use.&quot;

&quot;I think we&#39;d better go see Jenna,&quot; Sharin said into the long silence 
that statement left in it&#39;s wake. She looked over at the Commander, &quot;So 
who&#39;s your friend?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Allison said, &quot;this is Commander Laurel D&#39;ken of the heavy 
cruiser Liberty&#39;s Sword.&quot; She quickly introduced the others to the 
officer who was looking at the group thoughtfully.

&quot;Welcome aboard,&quot; Laurel smiled, &quot;and follow me.&quot;

The group crowded into the lift, rising on the nearly transparent 
glowing disk. &quot;You all right?&quot; Amara asked softly, her voice mildly 
dangerous. It was clear in her tone that if Allison had been hurt by 
someone on this ship, they were going to pay.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Allison answered back quietly, &quot;just a case of post teleport 
tummy ache.&quot;

Kat blinked, overhearing enough to ask, &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;The first time you get transported can be rough on your body,&quot; Amara 
explained with a slight smile, &quot;it can even make you be sick.&quot;

&quot;Ewww,&quot; Kat made a face.

It only took a few moments for them to reach the bridge, the bunch of 
them happily leaving the tight confines of the lift. Jenna turned in the 
command chair, the dark haired princess&#39; face lighting up in a smile as 
she saw them, &quot;Welcome!&quot;

Milly all but bounded over to her side, looking her over worriedly. 
&quot;They didn&#39;t harm you?&quot; she asked anxiously.

&quot;I&#39;m quite all right,&quot; Jenna reassured her friend with a smile. She 
reached out to take Allison&#39;s hand as she came near then looked over at 
the others and said, &quot;We&#39;ll talk in the captain&#39;s ready room.&quot; She 
looked at Laurel a moment later, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;As you wish,&quot; Laurel nodded. She lead the band across the bridge, the 
other officers watching them as she keyed open a door, &quot;Should I have 
refreshments sent up?&quot;

&quot;No thanks,&quot; Allison shook her head. She looked thoughtful, &quot;It might be 
a good idea for you to stick around, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Jenna added with a smile.


&quot;Of course,&quot; Laurel actually blushed a bit under her smile.

&quot;So would someone mind telling me what is going on?&quot; Sharin asked once 
they settled down into seats around the long table. Outside the windows 
the blue Earth slowly turned below them, wreathed in strips of white 
clouds.

&quot;I suppose I should,&quot; Laurel said, standing by a monitor screen set into 
a wall. &quot;A few weeks ago the Star Empire launched an attack on our own 
Empire, intending to conquor us,&quot; she said.

&quot;Those damn....&quot; Milly growled out, her hair standing up on tail and 
ears.

&quot;Queen Jen&#39;ai ordered the Liberty&#39;s Sword dispatched here for the 
princess&#39; protection,&quot; Laurel continued, &quot;along with an engineering crew 
to oversee her repairs.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re here to take Jenna home?&quot; Kat asked, the brown haired young 
woman gazing out the window at the Earth in awe.

&quot;No,&quot; Laurel shook her head firmly, &quot;if the princess merely chooses to 
remain here we will stay to stand guard over her as best we can.&quot;

Roma lookwed over at Marilyn then the android turned back to Laurel, 
&quot;We&#39;d be honored to assist in anyway we can.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Laurel grinned, &quot;I already have a repair team working on your 
cruiser.&quot;

&quot;You said you had an engineering crew,&quot; Amara said, the black haired 
woman looking at her intently, &quot;what about the regular crew?&quot;

&quot;The engineers are it,&quot; Laurel said a bit apologetically, &quot;the regular 
crew were broken up between other ships of the line.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Sharin muttered, &quot;we have a fully operable ship but no-one 
qualified to run it.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far,&quot; Laurel said wryly.

&quot;Be that as it may,&quot; Jenna said softly, &quot;I intend to take this ship home 
to see my mother.&quot;

Into the silence that little bombshell left Alison quietly added, &quot;And 
I&#39;m going with her.&quot;

Milly didn&#39;t hesitate a heartbeat, &quot;Me, too.&quot;

&quot;Suppose I&#39;d better tag along,&quot; Sharin pushed her blonde hair back 
casually as she said, &quot;someone has to keep you out of trouble.&quot;

&quot;You intend to take a partially crewed vessel back into what may be a 
warzone?&quot; Amara said thoughtfully. She met Allison&#39;s eyes a moment then 
sighed, &quot;Then you&#39;d better have a good tactical officer along. I 
volunteer, of course.&quot;

&quot;Our crusier can offer support if combat is necessary,&quot; Marilyn offered 
eagerly.

&quot;Kat, you....&quot; Allison started only to be cut off.

&quot;You think I&#39;m missing out on something like this?&quot; Kat demanded. She 
shook her head, &quot;The chance to go out into space, to see alien worlds 
and cultures... I&#39;d be a fool to pass this up.&quot;

&quot;This is going to be interesting,&quot; Laurel murmured. She looked over at 
Jenna, &quot;You said your friends would come along, I guess you&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;How long until we can leave?&quot; Jenna asked the Commander mildly.

Laurel looked thoughtful, &quot;We&#39;ll finish the recovery of the Patrol 
cruiser, then get the ship ready to go. Two days, give or take.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go for that,&quot; Allison said with a smile.</pre>
