<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A young girl ran down the winding city streets of her hometown, her 
backpack slung over her shoulder and a duffle bag held tightly in her 
arms. She kept her eyes low as she quickened her pace. She didn&#39;t want 
anyone to recognize her as she ventured downtown on that early morning 
hour. People didn&#39;t seem to notice the girl as she pushed her way 
against the crowd towards the train station. That was fine by her. She 
dug through her pocket to check if the train ticket she found that night 
was still there. A ticket that she had bought in her dreams and 
discovered on her dresser when she woke. She felt some comfort at the 
feeling of the paper between her fingers, a sign of her only chance of 
escaping the never-ending madness of her life. Upon entering the station 
she quickly glanced around to see it was sparsely filled with the few 
people who headed out to work at such an ungodly hour as this. She 
ignored the people and ran down a set of stairs to the main tracks. A 
large clock told the girl that her train would be leaving in only a few 
moments, which was just the way she wanted it to be. There was no time 
for anyone to stop her if they figured out her plan. Everything was 
perfect. 

She broke into a sprint down the last of the stairs and along the long 
platform. She turned around and walked backwards to make sure she was 
not being followed. Nervously she pulled her backpack higher on her 
shoulder and quickly turned around again to find herself face to face 
with another girl. She had no time to stop herself before colliding into 
her, forcing both of them to tumble to the ground. She rubbed her knee 
and began to apologize when the bell tolling the train&#39;s departure rang 
throughout the station. She grabbed her duffle bag, jumped to her feet 
and dashed for the train doors with the other girl, and someone whom she 
suspected must have been the girl&#39;s friend, close on her heels. All 
three leapt onto the train just as the doors closed behind them. The 
entire car was empty other then the three girls. Panting she found 
herself a seat and plopped down, trying hard to catch her breath. She 
opened her eyes to see the girl she bumped into sitting across from her. 
The girl simply smiled at her. There was something about that smile, 
something that she could not put her finger on. The train started to 
move. Relieved to be finally on her way the girl let out a deep sigh and 
bid a goodbye to her old life.
