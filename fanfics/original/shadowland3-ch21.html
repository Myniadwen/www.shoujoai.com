<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 21 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Nicole strolled across the Academy grounds deep in her own thoughts when 
she heard voices from behind her. She felt herself tense up at the sound 
of the voices, knowing far to well who they belonged too without turning 
around to see Kelly and her small gang running towards her. Kelly hated 
Natalie and since she could not take the girl on in a fair fight she 
extracted her frustrations out on Nicole. More then one time Nicole had 
returned home after a long day at school with bruises upon her arms and 
chest. Kelly was smart and never hit Nicole in the face knowing that if 
Natalie found out it would be the death of her, but she also knew that 
Nicole was too proud of the fact that she was not a permanent resident 
of the Academy that she would never tell a soul about the beatings.


&quot;There you are you little twerp.&quot; Kelly called out as she raced across 
the school grounds, &quot;I have a message for your sister.&quot; 

Nicole did not wait for the girl to catch up to her before breaking into 
a sprint, her small legs pumping with all their might as she hurried out 
of the academy ground and down the road to the village below. She had 
encounters with Kelly and her gang several times over the passed year 
and had learned several short cuts to get her home unharmed, or at least 
only mildly scathed. Taking a quick turn she darted down a small path 
through a small wooded area between the town and the school, sliding 
down the embracement and cutting her hand upon a sharp rock along the 
way. 

Nicole refused to allow Kelly to get the better of her, or to have to 
call on her sister for protection. She would fight her own battles in 
her own way. Sure at that moment it meant running away, but she was sure 
she would be allowed to enter weapons class next year and then she would 
ask Alyson if she can borrow one of the girl&#39;s swords. The elementary 
students were not allowed to carry weapons and they had to wait until 
they were in grade seven before they could join. She was nearly through 
her sixth year of school and just needed to keep one step a head of 
Kelly until then and she would be fine.

She smiled to herself as she broke out of the woods and out onto a small 
road, a car honked as it veered out of the way of the girl, nearly 
missing her. Nicole&#39;s hear raced at the sound of the car horn and she 
took a moment to catch her breath when she heard the gang of girls 
sliding down the embankment towards her. Double quick she ran across the 
street and started down one of the many back alleys that wove throughout 
the town. She knew she wasn&#39;t supposed to enter The Alley&#39;s as much as 
she knew she was not supposed to go near the Western Woods, but at that 
moment she would rather face the creatures of The Alleys then Kelly, who 
she was sure would cut her with that knife of hers just like she had 
threatened to do the last time. 

She zigzagged down the many tiny streets that would not even allow a car 
to travel along. Tall brick walls towered over her with many boarded up 
windows, blocking out the light of an already cloud covered sun, some 
areas so black that streets lights had already began to flicker to life. 
She was certain that she was deep within the maze of the Alleys and 
prayed that meant that Kelly and her gang would leave her alone, too 
afraid to enter the depths of this nightmarish place. She stopped for a 
moment and glanced around herself, trying to gain her bearings, when she 
heard Kelly&#39;s voice call out for her, angrier then before. 

Nicole took a glance over her shoulder; stumbling over a trashcan in 
front of her and scrapped her knees and palms upon the rough asphalt 
road. Sobbing in fear and pain she staggered to her feet and was about 
to begin running again when something hit her hard in the back and she 
stumbled forward, skidding across the ground on her shoulder this time, 
banging her head off the ground. Dizzily she got to her feet to find 
herself surrounded by several girls, and Kelly standing over her with 
her knife in hand. 

&quot;What did I tell you about running away from me?&quot; Kelly snarled and 
motioned to one of the girls, &quot;Pick her up.&quot; She commanded pointing the 
knife at Nicole. 

Two girls took Nicole by the arms and hauled her up against the brick 
wall, knocking several more trashcans out of the way as they did so. 

Nicole shook in fright, her eyes never leaving the girl&#39;s knife, &quot;P... 
please d... don&#39;t hurt me...&quot; She pleaded. 

&quot;P... P... Please don&#39;t hurt me.&quot; Kelly mimicked and laughed, a couple 
of the girls joining her laughter, &quot;You know the rules. You never make 
me run.&quot; She growled.

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Nicole sobbed wishing Alyson was there to protect 
her, or even her sister for that matter. 

&quot;Your sorry.&quot; Kelly punched the girl in the stomach with the bunt of her 
dagger, &quot;You&#39;re going to be sorry that is for sure.&quot;

Nicole cried out in pain and struggled to free herself from her captors 
only to find herself out of energy, &quot;Please...&quot; She sobbed, wanting 
nothing more then to go home. 

Kelly took the girl by the face in one hand and made her look into her 
eyes, &quot;I think it is time to teach you a proper lesson.&quot; She stated 
holding the tip of the knife close enough to Nicole&#39;s face that she 
could see the refection of the fear in her own eyes in the surface of 
the blade. 

One of the girls backed up nervously, &quot;Your not going to really cut her, 
are you?&quot; The girl asked worriedly, glancing around anxiously. 

&quot;No, not hurt her.&quot; Kelly stated as she moved the tip of the blade 
lightly across Nicole&#39;s cheek and down her chest, &quot;Just give her 
something she will enjoy.&quot; She remarked with a sinister grin, &quot;&#39;Just 
like her slut of a sister.&quot; She slid the knife down to the girl&#39;s skirt 
and let the blade dig into the fabric, then pulled up the hem and 
revealing the girl&#39;s panties. Kelly then turned the knife around and 
took it by the blade and preceded to push the bunt into Nicole&#39;s crotch, 
&quot;You want that don&#39;t you slut.&quot; 

Nicole cried as she felt the dagger grind against her crotch, &quot;N... 
no... no...&quot; She sobbed. 

&quot;Maybe you want it inside of you.&quot; Kelly inquired, pushing the knife 
harder, &quot;Or do you prefer tongue like your sister?&quot; 

Nicole suddenly screamed out, her voice echoing against the walls of the 
Alley, filling it with the sounds of her anguished screams. Suddenly a 
bright light filled the end of the alley and a bright ball of fire came 
racing towards the girls. 

&quot;A Flame Dog!?!&quot; One of the girls screamed out and let go of Nicole as 
she hurried away from the light. 

&quot;Don&#39;t let it eat me.&quot; Another girl cried as she followed the first. The 
rest chasing after their heels leaving only Kelly standing on her own, 
with Nicole curled up at her feet. 

The fireball disappeared as quickly as it had appeared and a large man 
dressed in a long white cloak appeared down the alley walking towards 
them, a sword in hand. Kelly turned to the man holding her knife out in 
defence. The man stepped up to the girl, allowing the tip of the blade 
to touch his cloak and he stared down her. 

&quot;I suggest you leave if you want to live.&quot; The man commanded, and 
abruptly a flaming dog appeared over the man&#39;s shoulders and snarled at 
the girl. The beast stood at least ten feet in height with hungry eyes 
burning brightly and drops of red saliva dripping from its long unevenly 
jagged teeth. A forked tongue darted out of its mouth more like a lizard 
then a dog and appeared to lick at its lips. 

Kelly quickly scrambled backwards and ran out of the Alleys as quickly 
as her legs could carry her. 

Nicole cringed against the wall; hugging her knees tightly to her chest 
and staring up at the man, fear in her tear-filled eyes. The man looked 
down at the girl and watched her for a moment. 

&quot;You are Nicole Harshaw, are you not?&quot; He inquired simply, studying the 
girl. 

Nicole slowly nodded her head. 

&quot;I am Drakious Dalfort,&quot; The man greeted the child, &quot;Alyson&#39;s brother.&quot;

Nicole&#39;s eyes brighten at the sound of Alyson&#39;s name, &quot;H... Her 
brother?!?&quot; She said in both surprises and awe, she had heard about the 
man from her sister before, but this was the first time she ever had a 
chance to meet him. His short curly white bangs hung over his eyes 
shadowing them from view, but somehow Nicole could not see this man as 
the monster that her sister described, in fact she found herself 
relieved to be in his presence. 

Drake slowly nodded and held a hand out to the girl, &quot;If you come with 
me I can make sure those girl&#39;s never hurt you again.&quot; He offered 
kneeling in front of the girl. 

Nicole stared at the man&#39;s hand, then up at the man&#39;s face, searching 
for any sign of the evil that her sister had told her about. The man&#39;s 
face only showed sincerity in those deep dark eyes. Slowly she reached 
out towards the man when he pulled his hand away slightly and she stared 
at him in puzzlement. 

&quot;First you must make a promise to me.&quot;
