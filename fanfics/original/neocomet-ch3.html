~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Highland Mansion, Manchester, Neo-England

&quot;Ya! Ha! Yaah!&quot;

Steel (or a substance that greatly resembled it) slice through the 
chilled wind of an English morning. This sword belonged to a solitary 
young fighting woman, the first female partisan of Roundsman, and 
younger sister of the renowned Aarin. 
Ingrid Highland. 

Clad in her shining sliver tinted armour, the young woman thrust and 
slashed the Lightning Tooth in a multiplicity of different directions 
and positions, her own form of practice. It was similar to the katas 
preformed be martial artists. Though it was training, it meant more to 
her than that. It gave the beautiful young fighter a chance to think 
things through. And right now, Ingrid did have quite a few things she 
wanted to think about. But before she could, she felt something stir 
inside her hand. Ingrid stopped slicing at the air, and took a glance at 
the hand holding her sword, the Lightning Tooth. 

It was vibrating violently in her grip. This had been happening quite a 
few times since she first received it, and Ingrid had been nervous about 
what this thing could really do. But all the same, she did not want to 
be overcome by the blade. It was he one chance at defeating Aarin. Her 
one chance and she had to take it. Ingrid gripped onto the handle of the 
Lightning Tooth with the other hand, and struggled hard to control its 
movements. 

&quot;Geez!&quot; Ingrid yelled irately. &quot;What... is this thing?!&quot;

Soon the shaking of the sword became frantic, so much so that Ingrid 
doubted that she could hold it any longer. Rather than drop it 
completely, Ingrid thrust the Lightning Tooth into the ground in one 
quick strike. The second it hit the grassy floor, streaks of crystal 
blue electricity shot out from it in waves, dissipating slowly into 
nothingness. Breathing a sigh of relief, Ingrid sat down slowly, 
hazarding a glance at her strangely un-cooperative blade.

&quot;What the heck is up with that thing?&quot; Ingrid wondered. &quot;You&#39;d think it 
was alive or something... but I need it to defeat Aarin. I have to beat 
him... to prove that I can be the best swordswoman on the planet.&quot;

Suddenly, a voice called out to Ingrid. &quot;You&#39;re well on yer way, lass.&quot;

Ingrid&#39;s solid blue eyes widened, and she instantly shot up from her 
sitting position. She&#39;d know that hoarse voice from anywhere. It was her 
faithful sword master, Roundsman. Roundsman was one of Neo-England&#39;s 
most respected swordfighters. Not only was he a trainer, he was also a 
part time blacksmith, who forged his own swords. He was a tall, burly, 
chiselled man, with a thick mop of grey hair, matching the fading grey 
of his stout beard. Though he was getting old, (he was already 48) 
Roundsman was in great shape for his age. It was understandable that he 
commanded so much respect from the Neo-English swordplay community. 

Ingrid smiled, doing a quick nod of respect. &quot;Master Roundsman.&quot;

The two were currently in the back gardens of the Highland mansion, this 
was Ingrid&#39;s normal training ground, but she had no idea that Roundsman 
would be visiting her. 
Roundsman grinned at Ingrid, then at the Lightning Tooth, buried into 
the grassy ground. &quot;You&#39;ve been practicing&#39;, haven&#39;t yer? That&#39;s the way 
forward. But you shouldn&#39;t pin yer blade into the earth like that. 
You&#39;ll dull the tip.&quot;

Ingrid also took a look back at the Lightning Tooth, with a concerned 
glare. &quot;I know... but... that thing it... I know it sounds crazy, 
Master, but I swear, that sword was vibrating a minute ago.&quot;

&quot;Oh, ho, ho, ho!&quot; Roundsman bellowed into the morning air with a 
haughty, amused laugh. &quot;You&#39;ve certainly got quite an imagination on ya, 
Ingrid Highland. It&#39;s just nerves, you&#39;ll get over it.&quot;

Ingrid tried hard to believe that. &quot;I... guess so.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve made a great deal of progress, Ingrid.&quot; Roundsman mused, with a 
deep pride. &quot;Look at you. You&#39;re a strong woman. You know, many people 
doubted that I could mould you into a warrior. But I believed otherwise. 
And I was right. You have come a long way. Still, you do have much to 
learn about the way of the sword. As long as you are committed to 
progress, then it will follow.&quot;

Ingrid appreciated that vote of confidence. &quot;Thank you, sir. I&#39;m glad 
you taught me too. This is all thanks to you. I won&#39;t let you down.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure that you won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;So...&quot; Ingrid started. &quot;Did you come here to tell me that, or did you 
want something else? Are there anymore classes?&quot;

Roundsman coughed into his fist, attempting vainly to cover up his wide 
grin. &quot;Well... I was going to give this to you in a few months time, but 
I feel I should give it to you now.&quot;

Now Ingrid was curious. &quot;Huh?&quot;

Rather than say anything, Roundsman shoved his grizzly hand into his 
pocket, and then wrenched out at a large sapphire stone, with the words 
&#39;Roundsman Lioness&#39; carved into it. The scorching blue stone was 
dangling off a silver chain, a line of silver rings linked into one 
necklace. Roundsman clasped Ingrid&#39;s hand gingerly, smiling with eyes of 
long-felt pride and joy, and placed the necklace into her hand. Ingrid 
looked up at her master, and then back down at the silver neck chain 
placed in her hand. It was well known to be a treasured memento of his 
first student, Aesus, the young man who died tragically in unknown 
circumstances 3 years ago. Obviously the carving was new, but the chain 
definitely belonged to Aesus. Ingrid would have never fathomed that 
Roundsman would give this away. It was a symbol of the power he could 
draw forth from a human being. 

&quot;What...&quot; Ingrid was speechless. &quot;This is... but... I... &quot;

Roundsman continued to smile. &quot;I cannot really say how proud I am of 
you, but this might show you. Aesus... was a great tragedy, but our 
school will continue. Under your strength... you will officially be my 
successor, Ingrid Highland.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Shougatsu Financial Group HQ, Munich, Neo-Germany

&quot;Do you mean to tell me that you have wasted 37.2% of this fiscal year&#39;s 
budget? All to find these inane four swords?&quot;

Zephaniah growled roughly under his breath, eliciting a frightened look 
of worry from the administrative board member. This was the usual sort 
of obstructions he had to face these days. The power behind the 
Shougatsu Financial Group was mostly due to the investments of lower, 
slightly minor companies. Though the group was well under Zephaniah&#39;s 
control, the stocks that others had in the Shougatsu Financial Group 
were very important to its survival. 

Which also meant that he had to deal with these people. It just wouldn&#39;t 
do to upset them. Not now at least. Zephaniah&#39;s bright red eyes scanned 
the room. It was the usual venue for the board meeting, the second 
highest floor of the building, in the de-briefing room. A circular room 
was placed into the middle of the room, with a chain of 7 button-nosed, 
glasses-wearing pencil pushers. At the head of the table was Zephaniah, 
his arms crossed and his eyes narrowed. He did hate all of this 
organizational, commercialist nonsense. It weakened his fighting soul. 
One day, he knew well that he would purge himself of such meaningless, 
clerical games. 

&quot;You insect.&quot; Zephaniah seethed to his opposite. &quot;Do you question my 
plans? Have you any idea of how powerful those swords could make us? If 
your head were not so far up your anal sphincter you would probably see 
that the world could be ours.&quot;

The questioning pencil pusher silenced himself from Zephaniah&#39;s insult, 
though he was nursing a slight anger from it also. Before things got 
heated one of the other board members intervened. He was much older in 
age compared to the rest of the group, so he had a more neutral take on 
this situation. The younger generation seemed only to care about making 
money. 

&quot;I understand what you&#39;re trying to say, Zephaniah.&quot; The old man 
commented, looking at the SFG leader. &quot;Though the Four Sword Dossier you 
have compiled is very impressive, you still lack the swords. It is only 
understandable that we have doubts about the legitimacy of your 
endeavours when you have submitted nothing to prove their existence. All 
we have to go by is the ten-year-old study of a dead archaeologist. 
Until you bring us some proof of the legend, then I do believe you will 
be contested again at the next board meeting.&quot;

Zephaniah studied the group as they all began to murmur in acceptance of 
that last speech; this was what it was all about. They needed proof...

Zephaniah began to speak. &quot;So that&#39;s it... you need proof, do you? Then 
so be it. One of the swords has already been located in Neo-England 
anyway. The second sword, the Lightning Tooth. I will have it brought 
here immediately and I will prove to the council that the Second Origin 
Project is more than mere speculation and myth. I will prove to you that 
we are on the verge of a new genesis... for all of mankind...&quot; 

One of the other board members smiled deviously, nudging at the man next 
to him privately. &quot;He sounds like a scientist. A typical romantic... too 
bad his &#39;new genesis&#39; doesn&#39;t help us get any richer.&quot;

Though there was a twelve-metre gap between that man and Zephaniah, the 
white haired leader heard him clearly. &quot;So I am a romantic, am I? Those 
without faith always fall prey to the realities of a situation. I will 
make you eat those words when I return to the next meeting with the 
Blade of Thunder. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have preparations to 
organize for the Ten Sekai Sentou Kyousou (Heavenly World Combat 
Competition) therefore this meeting is adjourned.&quot;

After grudgingly accepting that, the board members of the Shougatsu 
Financial Group&#39;s inner committee all got up and dispersed. Though they 
hadn&#39;t set up an agenda for the next meeting, they were all fairly sure 
of what it would entail. Primarily, the progress of all of Zephaniah&#39;s 
efforts. As the last of the board members passed through the adjacent 
door, the red-eyed Zephaniah growled darkly ender his breath, clutching 
his fist into a ball. 

&quot;Damn executives...!&quot; He roared. &quot;If they were not so consumed with the 
ever-flowing obesity of their wallets then they would see that the 
Second Origin is the future of mankind! Blast them! I swear... if I did 
not need them, I would cut the heads off of each and every one of those 
limp-wrist bastards.&quot;

&quot;It would seem that you have a problem.&quot;

Red eyes as cold and fluid as blood ran over to the direction in which 
that statement came from. He looked across to the other side of the room 
to see another man, hidden in the shadows of the de-briefing room. 
Zephaniah studied him. He was a total stranger. He was swathed in a dark 
grey cloak that covered most of his body, the hood was darkened, and so 
it was impossible to see his face. He was a little shorter than 
Zephaniah in height, and from the sound of his voice, he was probably in 
his mid-30&#39;s at least. His large feet were sandaled, and his sleek hand 
hung loosely between the sheets of his pallid cloak, just visible by the 
contrast of skin. His eyes almost shone, in a way, brightly, in the 
darkness of the hood, a bright white. Zephaniah&#39;s eyes narrowed. He was 
obviously an intruder. How was this man allowed to sneak into the 
Shougatsu Financial Group&#39;s building so easily?

&quot;You there.&quot; Zephaniah said directly, tapping a button under his desk. 
One that signalled for security. &quot;I don&#39;t know how you snuck into this 
building, but you shall be removed.&quot;

The cloaked man smiled, though it was impossible to tell from the 
darkness of his hood. &quot;I do believe that you would regret that. As hard 
as it is to believe, I am your destiny. You can&#39;t resist destiny.&quot;

Zephaniah&#39;s grip of his fist got tighter. &quot;Security will be here in a 
few moments. State your business!&quot;

&quot;I am here to lead you to your destiny.&quot; The cloaked man said. 
&quot;...Zephaniah Aeon. Or should I say... Aesus...?&quot;

Blood red eyes went wide. &quot;H-How do you know that name?!&quot;

&quot;That is not important. What is important is that you confront your 
destiny. It&#39;s something you must face. And to guide you on your way, I 
will divulge a secret to you. In your search, you should direct your 
attention to the crater...&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot; Zephaniah said surprised. &quot;Do you mean the original crater 
where the Genesis Comet crashed into the earth&#39;s surface? You fool! That 
crater is in the northern arctic. The ice around it collapsed seven 
years ago and now the whole of the fissure is submerged in freezing cold 
waters. No one could reach that place now. It&#39;s virtually impossible.&quot; 

The cloaked man shook his head. &quot;Don&#39;t be so na&iuml;ve. The world is much 
more diverse than you isolated warriors believe. If you held your 
spirits strong, you&#39;d know that there is a way.&quot;

Zephaniah&#39;s white-coloured eyebrow rose. &quot;And you would happen to know 
the way of this would you? What exactly lies there? How do you know of 
my plans? And who are you?&quot;

The cloaked man smiled again. &quot;I can at least answer one of those 
questions.&quot; He removed the hood of his cloak, pulling it back. It 
revealed his face. He was definitely around 37 in age, his elongated 
black pelt falling loosely behind his head, while the front bangs of his 
hair (brown in colour) fell above his face, blocking view from his eyes. 
&quot;My name is Nagare Utsume. I am the man who-&quot;

Zephaniah filled in the blanks. &quot;...The man who accompanied Keijiro 
Seisuji into the Genesis Comet. The man who disappeared two days before 
Keijiro completed the Four Sword Study...&quot;

&quot;Correct.&quot; Nagare said. &quot;And I know who you are also. For reasons you 
could not begin to imagine... but will have the pleasure of knowing... 
all too soon. But before you venture into the crater of the Genesis 
Comet... I think you will need to silence the doubts of your fellow 
businessmen.&quot;

&quot;I am not a businessman.&quot; Zephaniah said.

After a short pause, Nagare continued. &quot;All the same... you need to 
quell the fires of disbelief burning in them... and you can do that by 
displaying the power of the final sword...&quot;

Zephaniah could not believe what he was hearing. &quot;Do you mean...?&quot;

&quot;Yes... I speak of the Shadow Edge.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Bio-Technological Research Department (Neo-Japan Branch), Nagoya

&quot;Aye... but who are you...?&quot;

Ayame tightened up when she took her first glimpse at Julia McAmish. 
Strictly speaking, she did not expect the young woman to be so... well, 
pretty. She had been in captivity for little less than a year if what 
Simon had said was of any worth. Yet she looked so healthy and full of 
life. And her surroundings didn&#39;t seem to be all that hospitable. It was 
the true sign of a magic-user, an Ashidah. To be full of vitality and 
drive even in the most extreme of circumstances. And so Julia had been 
found. Ayame relinquished her hold over the hilt of Nobunaga and strode 
up to the slightly older woman. Julia held firm, even though there was a 
little fright in her eyes. Which was understandable after what she had 
been through. When Ayame realized that she was being a little 
forthcoming, she stopped herself and answered the question set for her.

&quot;Sorry to frighten you,&quot; Ayame said, running her hand through her jet 
black bangs, &quot;I don&#39;t do too many rescue missions so I&#39;m kinda lacking 
in the tact needed for these situations. My name is Ayame Nakagawa. Your 
Father, Simon McAmish, paid me to set you free from these people. I know 
this might be a lot to take in after all you&#39;ve had to suffer... but we 
have to get you out of here.&quot;

Julia blinked, looking downwards with those wide green eyes of hers. &quot;My 
Father... you know his name. Then you must be telling the truth. But why 
would you involve yourself in matters like this? The Shougatsu Financial 
Group won&#39;t stand for it. If they find out that I&#39;ve gotten free... 
they&#39;ll hunt me down again. And my Grandfather... he&#39;s dead... because 
of what happened last time... that could happen to my Father...&quot;

Ayame shook her head. &quot;No. You&#39;re mistaken. Your Father told me about 
that. Your Grandfather was just knocked unconscious during your 
kidnapping. He was brought back to full health later on.&quot;

Julia&#39;s eyes suddenly brightened. &quot;Y-You mean... Grandpa is still 
alive?&quot;

&quot;As far as I know.&quot; Ayame said, shrugging. 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it...&quot; Soon tears began welling up in Julia&#39;s beautiful 
emerald eyes, &quot;after all this time and after all the worrying I 
suffered... I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s still alive...&quot;

Ayame scowled, then grabbed Julia by the wrist. &quot;Save your emotional 
breakthroughs for later, okay? Your Father&#39;s out there waiting for you 
and 8,500 credits are waiting for me when I take you to him. Now lets 
just get out of here.&quot;

That she could do. Julia nodded to the brash young rescuer, and followed 
her along as she began running out of the door back into the main 
corridor. The two women began their path to escape from the 
Bio-Technological Research Department. Again Ayame dodged past all the 
security cameras and Julia made her best attempt to mimic this action, 
whilst being dragged along by the wrist. Of course, this was a lab that 
belonged to the Shougatsu Financial Group. No one could get in and out 
without getting caught. Not even someone with the great stealth skills 
of the Dark Katana. One camera was linked to the room that Julia had 
been locked in. Images of all that had happened and had been said were 
beamed to a separate room of the complex. This room was filled with 
video units and video screens that were attached to the many cameras 
dotted around the lab. Four men stood it that room. Three of them were 
manning a selection of computers at the edges of the room, while the 
fourth man stood at the centre of it. He was the more significant. He 
was dressed in the white coat of a scientist, and had a small tag on the 
chest pocket of his coat that said his name &#39;Dr. Kyosuke Bai&#39;. 

The scientist nudged his glasses up the bridge of his nose as they 
slipped a little and looked over at the security team member to the far 
right. &quot;Is everything okay there? You look...&quot;

That particular man gave a surprised glare over his shoulder. &quot;No, sir! 
Test Sample Magi-019 has escaped from her cell!&quot;

Dr. Bai&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s escaped, sir,&quot; The man tapped some readings into the keyboard he 
was manning, changing the image on the screen to that of Ayame and 
Julia, who by now were inside the elevator and ascending to the top 
level, &quot;she seems to have been freed by an intruder! A Neo-Japanese 
female, armed with a standard-E weapon!&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Dr. Bai mused this all over, &quot;I probably should have killed Julia 
along with Test Samples 001-018. But her affinity with Darkness Magic is 
so strong that I hesitated. And her data was put to good use for the 
Second Origin Project... but in time we could have extracted even more 
data from her. Regardless, if she gets out she could spread details of 
the tests we subjected her to. And I doubt that Master Zephaniah wishes 
to reveal the true nature of our company until Second Origin is 
complete.&quot;

One of the other men turned in his chair and spoke. &quot;So should we 
re-capture her now? I could call for the upper-level security teams to 
keep the test sample from escaping.&quot;

Dr. Bai shook his head. &quot;No. Whoever that woman is who helped the test 
sample escape, she is clearly no ordinary fighter. So we will not use 
any ordinary method of recapturing that which is ours.&quot;

The third man spoke in his turn. &quot;So then... what will we do?&quot;

The glasses of the wise doctor gleamed. &quot;...I think I&#39;ll use the second 
of the three Genocide Weapons to recapture the test sample. It is time 
to un-freeze Ras es-Shamrah.&quot;

All three of the subordinates gasped with fear and confusion. One of the 
Genocide Weapons? Did Dr. Bai really seek to reclaim the test sample 
with that kind of bio-machine? It couldn&#39;t have been any more of a 
confusing statement at all. But only one of the security team members 
spoke out about that confusion. 

&quot;But, sir...&quot; He pleaded, &quot;...do you really think it&#39;s wise to unleash 
that monster inside of the laboratory? We had it under full control the 
last time but there are never any guarantees after reawakening such an 
organism from Cryo-sleep.&quot;

Dr. Bai smiled privately. &quot;I understand such details. It would 
irresponsible if I weren&#39;t to do so. But we will allow the two to escape 
from the lab. I would prefer any battles to take place outside, lest 
they interfere with any of our experiments. And I have been looking for 
the perfect opportunity to test out the true level of the Ras 
es-Shamrah&#39;s powers. If they prove to be more worth the cost of 
production... it could lead to the re-funding of my older projects.&quot;

One of the support staff swallowed his gulp and turned back to the 
computer and keyboard he was manning, looking over the screen. 
&quot;...Then... do you want me to un-freeze the subject now, or...&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Dr. Bai turned his back to the three workers and walked towards 
the door out of that particular room. &quot;...I believe I will do it 
myself...&quot;

The talented doctor then walked from that observation room out into 
another white corridor. This section of the lab was a floor below the 
holding cells that bound people like Julia. But there was an even deeper 
holding chamber. Built for the purpose of preserving subjects that were 
not in current use for experimentation in the future. The time had come 
to awaken one of them. Dr. Bai passed through all the doors and 
staircases necessary to take him to the deepest level of the Research 
Facility. By which time the atmosphere had grown far colder. As the 
doctor came to the last leg of his journey, he stood before two solid 
metal doors that were marked with the phrase &#39;Cryogenic Preservation 
Chamber&#39;. Or CPC for short. It was far too cold in there for him. Even 
outside of the doors, every time he breathed, it released a puff of 
visible smog-like air. However. Dr. Bai turned to the right of him and 
placed his long fingers against the keypad of another electronic lock. 
But this time it had a videoscreen above it. The scientist began a set 
of keystrokes which switched on the videoscreen and gave a clear view of 
the innards of the CPC. Specifically, it gave a good view of one test 
tube in particular. It was covered in thin sheets of ice... and contain 
a grim, morbid looking figure inside of it. Along the bottom of the tube 
was a plaque that read...

&#39;GW-2: RAS ES-SHAMRAH&#39;

Dr. Bai smiled at the image of the test tube on the screen. &quot;It is time 
to awaken... my rabid instrument of destruction...&quot; 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Yuuga school of Sword Arts, Osaka, Neo Japan 

&quot;Namu amida butsu... namu amida butsu... namu amida butsu...&quot;

Cries, grunts of respect and painful weeping, all of it and more was 
heard in the respectfully quiet inner halls of the Yuuga School. It had 
been three days since Setsuya had arrived in Osaka for his return, now 
it was time for the funeral of his master. Swordfighters, villagers, 
friends, family, no matter who it was, they all came to the funeral to 
send off the great master of the Yuuga arts. The actual ceremony took 
place out in the main courtyard, where willing participants gave their 
last few words of respect. The ceremony was then continued in the fields 
just outside of the school, where other burials had taken place. It was 
sacred ground to the old master. One of his last wishes was to be buried 
within its soil. 

While the others attending the funeral wept or remained silent, Setsuya 
and Aarin stood back politely and watched it all take place. The master 
meant different things to different people, for different reasons. 

To Setsuya, the master symbolized the last shred of family he thought he 
had, and his death presented a great loss. To Aarin, the master was the 
saviour of his soul, the man who allowed his escape from the monotonous 
lifestyle of an English noble. Aarin wanted a chance to be free, to fly 
on his own wings, and that was the gift his master gave him. 

For both Setsuya and Aarin, the burial of the old master meant a turning 
point. A signal that relying on others to reach happiness was a dying 
practice. It was time to move on and grow up, for both of them. The monk 
standing at the foot of the grave continued to chant the sutra as the 
village workers shovelled the soil back into the hole, over the coffin. 

&quot;Namu amida butsu... namu amida butsu... namu amida butsu...&quot;

Shortly after the grave was refilled, people laid down flowers beside 
the tombstone of the old master, each person walking away as their 
business was done with. Setsuya and Aarin did the same and then followed 
the rest of the group back into the Yuuga School. After the burial, 
there was a small gathering held inside the school, for all people to 
catch up and talk and reflect on the master. It was like a reception, 
though slightly less lively. As usual, Setsuya and Aarin were at the 
side of the room, watching the events unfold and musing over them 
between themselves. 

&quot;Not exactly a fun climate...&quot; Setsuya said, his eyes on the crowds. 
&quot;But it seems the people are actually starting to loosen up a bit.&quot;

Aarin&#39;s honey brown eyes were shut; his body leaning up against the old 
grey wall. &quot;These people are handling the loss the only way they can. I 
do not blame them for trying to put their suffering aside. Sometimes to 
only way to heal is to forget.&quot;

Setsuya ran a hand through his hair. &quot;You and your excuses for people. 
But... I suppose I can&#39;t blame you for that, Aarin. The master taught us 
in different ways.&quot;

&quot;He taught us what we needed to know.&quot; Aarin supplied sharply. &quot;The 
difference was the way we interpreted his words. He was a great man... I 
will find it hard to forget his teachings.&quot;

Setsuya did agree with that. &quot;Yeah.&quot; 

&quot;So where do you go from here?&quot; Aarin asked, his head turning to face 
Setsuya.

The dark-haired Japanese smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve got my path set, buddy. I&#39;m gonna 
head out to China, to a small village in northern province. That is my 
next target. What about you...?&quot;

Aarin thought for a second. &quot;I am... not quite sure. I came here to send 
off the master, and test out my skills against you... but I do not 
believe this is the best time to start a real battle between the two of 
us. I think I shall further hone my skills by exploring more of the 
east... maybe Korea or Thailand. Though it will take a while to get to 
either of those places by boat.&quot;

Setsuya grinned, holding out his hand to Aarin for a shake. &quot;Gotcha. I 
tell you what. Lets make a deal. The next time we see each other, we&#39;ll 
be ready and prepared to fight for real. Deal?&quot;

Aarin nodded, clasping his rival&#39;s free hand with his own in an 
accepting handshake. It was a fair and suitable pact. When they next 
met... nothing would stop them from revealing their true powers. They 
would push each other to the limit and discover once and for all who was 
the better of them.
