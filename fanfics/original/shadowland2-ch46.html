<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch45.html">Back to Part 45</a><pre>Amber washed Kim&#39;s hair as Kim stared dismally at the bathroom wall, she 
had finally managed to stop crying, but her mind no longer felt the 
same. A sense of loss and despair set into her heart and mind and she 
kept feeling like there was something she was forgetting but could not 
figure out what it was.

&quot;Ready to rinse?&quot; Amber inquired lightly. 

Kim lowered her head into the water without answering. She was in a 
stunned daze and blinked at the ceiling as Amber rinsed the shampoo from 
her hair then helped her back into a seated position. 

&quot;You alright Kim?&quot; Amber cautiously inquired. 

Kim slowly shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She rubbed her face with a 
handful of water then leaned over the edge of the tub, &quot;Everything feels 
so murky and I can barely remember much of anything before I got here... 
I&#39;m sorry about crying....&quot; She apologized, crossing her arms on the 
edge of the tub and rested her chin upon them.  

Amber gave the girl a small smile, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; She stated 
warmly, &quot;We all need a good cry every now and then.&quot; She glanced at the 
washroom door, &quot;I only wish Sarah would cry. She is getting so angry 
with the world and I fear that she may explode if she don&#39;t let it out 
soon.&quot; 

Kim looked at Amber, &quot;Do you like her?&quot; She timidly inquired.

Amber flushed and shook her head, &quot;Not Sarah... someone else...&quot; She let 
out a sigh.

&quot;AHA!!&quot; Sarah&#39;s voice resounded triumphantly. She came running to the 
washroom door carrying pair of overalls in her hands, &quot;Don&#39;t these look 
so cute?&quot; She inquired holding the pants up to herself, &quot;Amber, you 
should see her clothes they are so adorable.&quot; 

Kim flushed lightly at the girl&#39;s ecstatic reaction to her clothes and 
sunk into the tub, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She mumbled softly.

&quot;Welcome.&quot; Sarah set the pants on the edge of the sink, &quot;I found you a 
shirt as well and will go get it.&quot; 

&quot;Could you grab some underwear too?&quot; Amber requested. 

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Sarah replied with a smile, &quot;She has the cutest panties 
with little kitty prints on them.&quot; She exclaimed as she disappeared 
around the corner again. 

Kim flushed even brighter and sunk into the water up to her nose. 

Amber gave the girl a curious smile, &quot;Kitty prints hmmmm...?&quot; 

Kim popped her head out of the water; &quot;My mother bought them for me.&quot; 
She frantically explained, &quot;They were a birthday present, she knew I 
liked cats and will...&quot; She flushed again as she realized she was 
talking too much. 

Amber leaned close to Kim, &quot;I like puppies myself.&quot; She admitted with a 
smile then stood up, &quot;You ready to get out?&quot; Amber inquired, offering 
the girl a hand.

Kim slowly nodded, &quot;Thank you for staying with me.&quot; She took Amber by 
the hand and allowed herself to be pulled out of the water.

Amber moved across the room to grab a towel from a small closet near the 
door, &quot;Anytime.&quot; She unfolded the towel and held it out before Kim who 
searching for the tub stopper, &quot;You&#39;re my little sister after all.&quot;  

Kim plucked the stopper free then stood, &quot;You really think of me as your 
sister? You&#39;ve only known me one day.&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Amber dropped the towel upon the girl&#39;s head and helped her dry off, &quot;Of 
course.&quot; She pulled the towel off of Kim&#39;s head and smiled at her, &quot;I 
already know I like you and I see us being good friends. So of course 
you are my sister.&quot; 

Kim hugged Amber, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Sarah entered the room again with a black shirt and underwear, &quot;Here you 
are.&quot; She offered Amber, who took the clothes. 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Amber glanced over Sarah&#39;s shoulder to see Penny curled up on 
her bunk, &quot;How is Penny doing?&quot; She inquired as she handed to clothes to 
Kim. 

&quot;Alright I guess.&quot; Sarah shrugged, &quot;She asked for Kim a moment ago.&quot;  

&quot;She did?&quot; Kim exclaimed in surprise, nearly falling over in the tub as 
she tried to get her legs through the panties. She managed to catch her 
balance before hitting her head on the wall, &quot;Did she really ask for 
me?&quot; She inquired excitedly. 

Amber gave the girl a sly grin, &quot;Seems someone likes Penny.&quot; She 
remarked with a giggle. 

Kim blushed as she pulled the shirt over her head, &quot;It&#39;s not like that.&quot; 
She protested as she struggled to find the neck hole and her head popped 
out, &quot;I just want to be her friend.&quot; She explained. 

Amber picked up the overalls and handed them to Kim, &quot;Well I hope you 
become good friends.&quot; She remarked with a smile, &quot;She&#39;s going to need 
one now that Jessie is gone.&quot; Her smile quickly faded at the thought of 
Jessica. 

Kim got out of the tub and took the pants, &quot;Doesn&#39;t she have friends at 
school?&quot; She inquired pulling the pants on. 

Sarah shook her head, &quot;We&#39;re not allowed to go to school. 

&quot;Not allowed?&quot; Kim blinked in disbelief as she fumbled with the shoulder 
straps, &quot;Why not?&quot; 

&quot;Ma&#39;am says that we do not deserve to go to school.&quot; Amber explained as 
the three of them left the washroom to join the others, &quot;So she tutors 
us in the evening after we eat dinner.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Kim did not like the sound of that name for some reason. Maybe 
it was the way Amber said it, almost as if it hurt to utter the words. 

&quot;She runs the house.&quot; Sarah replied dismally, &quot;She demands that we call 
her &#39;Ma&#39;am&#39;&quot; She explained distastefully, &quot;She&#39;s a witch and plans to 
cooks us.&quot; 

Amber frowned at the girl&#39;s words, &quot;Then we would be lucky.&quot; She stated 
with a sigh, &quot;Anyway, Ma&#39;am is not the one to worry about.&quot; She 
explained as she climbed up into the windowsill, &quot;She get angry a lot 
but she is not what I&#39;m afraid of.&quot;

&quot;The bad men...&quot; Caitlin muttered from the corner with April curled up 
next to her.

&quot;Bad men?&quot; Kim turned to face Caitlin, &quot;Who are they?&quot;

&quot;You will find out soon enough.&quot; Amber remarked regretfully, &quot;Just hope 
you get one good night of sleep here.&quot; She said with a sad face, 
&quot;Because you won&#39;t be sleeping much after they come visiting.&quot;
