<h1>Tokyo Iron Child Akari (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/ironchild-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Tokyo Blossom tried hard to keep focus on this situation. She was in the 
barren, people-less grassland area outside of Tokyo. She had just been 
attacked by a small selection of the Asuka Group&#39;s many combat brigades. 
She had to get back to Tokyo to protect Ryoko from any danger she might 
face. Suddenly and inexplicably, all of that seemed to just... roll off 
Tokyo B&#39;s back, like so many wasted thoughts. The moment she saw this 
brown-haired girl... something just changed. Tokyo Blossom felt 
different somehow, as if seeing the mere image of this girl had altered 
her. 

It was almost as if they were destined to meet each other. 

Tokyo B tried to shake that odd feeling of distortion off. &quot;Man, what 
should I do? This girl must be with the Asuka Group. I should probably 
just head back to Tokyo as soon as I can... ah, but I can&#39;t just leave 
her here.&quot;

Her mind had already made itself up though. &quot;God, I must be asking for 
trouble.&quot;

Tokyo B sighed, just before reaching into the Land Golem and gently 
pulled the young girl out of its chest and into her arms. While holding 
the brunette, Tokyo smiled briefly at the sleeping angel, and then 
jumped out of the Land Golem and back onto solid ground.

&quot;It&#39;s getting late.&quot; Tokyo B said to no one in particular. &quot;I better 
find some shelter for the night.&quot;

**********

&quot;Mmmmm.&quot;

Akari watched as the brunette girl&#39;s bright emerald eyes rolled in her 
sockets, her eyelids fluttering as she was welcomed back into 
consciousness. It was hard, but Akari tried to keep her focus away from 
the mysterious girl, directing her attention to the outside. She had 
managed to de-link with her armour and find some shelter all before the 
girl had woken up, but it was going to be difficult to make it back to 
Tokyo without using her Mobile Shell. Luckily, the cave that they were 
hidden in was large enough to hold the both of them effortlessly, but 
small enough to remain... conspicuous.

When she realized that the starry sky couldn&#39;t distract her any longer, 
Akari looked back at the girl whom she had retrieved from that Land 
Golem. She seemed to be looking around the cave with slight worry, 
looking up and down as if she were searching for something. 

&quot;Hey.&quot; Akari said. &quot;So you&#39;re awake.&quot;

The girl blinked, looking back at Akari. &quot;W-Who are you?&quot;

&quot;Akari.&quot; The white-haired girl had no idea why she blindly gave her name 
out like that, considering that the girl she was talking to was dressed 
in Asuka Group combat uniform. &quot;Akari Minako.&quot;

The girl looked downwards. &quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Akari asked curiously.

&quot;I thought that... hearing your name might bring back some memories of 
something. But... I still don&#39;t remember anything... I can&#39;t remember 
anything...&quot;

To keep the other woman at ease, Akari tried to make her next comment, 
and the smile that went with it, as accommodating and as warm as 
possible. &quot;Can you at least remember your name?&quot;

The girl nodded. &quot;Yes. My... name is Kagome.&quot;

&quot;Ka... go... me...&quot; Akari let the syllables roll off her tongue. &quot;You 
have a beautiful name.&quot;

Kagome smiled awkwardly. &quot;T-Thank you...&quot;

Akari suddenly felt joyful now that Kagome was smiling. All of a sudden, 
that previous rush of lightning surged through Akari&#39;s body again, her 
senses bamboozled by a feeling so frank it shocked her, but so quick 
that she couldn&#39;t rightly place it. All from seeing some stranger smile. 
Akari looked down as Kagome had done before, sliding down to the cold, 
slightly damp floor of the cave. Though the darker areas of it, reaching 
far into the back, seemed to lead to nowhere, moss grew along the walls, 
even when going further in. Moss in turn meant oxygen, and oxygen meant 
another exit. Since the campsite for the Asuka Group&#39;s failed attack was 
a few minutes walk away, Akari doubted that the AG was involved with 
this cave. 

Good thing too, because there was no way she could use her armour now 
that Kagome knew her real name. One thing still bothered Akari though. 
Why would the Asuka Group just chuck a young girl into a Land Golem and 
expect her to defeat the White Orchid? Either they were making 
ridiculously low estimations of the Mobile Shell&#39;s power, or they 
weren&#39;t taking Akari seriously. Either way, it didn&#39;t matter much. 
Akari&#39;s ambition to destroy the Asuka Group had not changed.

When a new silence fell, Akari tried to open up conversation between 
herself and Kagome, before things started to get awkward. &quot;So... have 
you any memory of where you might live or in what town you live at?&quot;

Kagome shook her head, still looking downwards. &quot;No. I remember nothing. 
And I... I don&#39;t know what I will do right now, either. But I must find 
out why I am here, why I have no memories.&quot; Kagome finally looked back 
at Akari when a certain question crossed her mind. &quot;H-How did you... 
where did you find me?&quot;

That wasn&#39;t an easy question to answer. How could Akari say that she 
found the girl inside a war weapon of a specialized military unit that 
had been set up by the Asuka Group to kill her? 

&quot;Uh...&quot; Akari was never a good liar, especially around a pretty girl. 
&quot;Uh... well, I was making a trip from Yokohama to Tokyo, when my car 
broke down. Anyways, I... uh... found you by the roadside, and I 
realized that you needed help, so I carried you here.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Kagome was shocked at this. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say to that. 
But... thank you so much for doing this for me... I should not be 
burdening you with my life like this...&quot;

Akari twisted on the inside. &quot;Uh... well it was my pleasure... I guess.&quot;

&quot;I have no idea what I shall do when morning hits us.&quot; Kagome stated. 
 
&quot;Well...&quot; All of a sudden, Akari&#39;s feelings were commanding her mouth to 
say things she might have thought better of four hours earlier. &quot;Why 
don&#39;t you let me take care of you?&quot;

Kagome looked up. &quot;W-What?&quot;

&quot;I can take you back to my place.&quot; Akari said calmly. &quot;I mean, you can 
stay there as long as you like, as long as you don&#39;t mind the mess. 
Plus, I&#39;ve never had a room mate before, and, you haven&#39;t got a memory 
of your real home, so...&quot;

An even brighter smile appeared on Kagome&#39;s pink lips, a smile that shot 
straight through Akari like a silver bullet through flesh. Deep in her 
mind, Akari was asking herself &#39;why in the hell am I going to such 
effort for a stranger&#39; but the moment she dared to glance into those 
sweet jade eyes of her new friend, such questions meant nothing. 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Kagome said politely. &quot;Thank you... Akari.&quot;

Silly as it was, Akari felt herself smiling from the simple fact that 
Kagome had spoken her name. But then, Akari turned her gaze to the way 
the fire was flickering. She had scrounged up some firewood from the 
surrounding forests above the hill overlooking the grasslands and 
leading to Yokohama, just while Kagome had been sleeping. From the palm 
blasters of her Mobile Shell, Akari (or rather, Tokyo Blossom) managed 
to get a small blaze going. Though the fire was small, it was managing 
partially to keep she and Kagome warm. But for some reason, the fire was 
starting to flicker. At first, Akari had no way to explain it, but then 
she looked back out to the outside. The winds were picking up once 
again. 

&quot;Brrr!&quot; Akari joked, rubbing her hands up and down her sides to keep 
warm. &quot;It&#39;s freezing. Those blasted winds out there are to blame. I&#39;m 
gonna move to the south one of these days.&quot;

Kagome continued to smile. &quot;Maybe you should... come closer to the 
fire.&quot;

&quot;Nah, I&#39;ve got to keep an eye out. Who knows what could find its way in 
here. You enjoy it.&quot;

Another silence fell. But this time, Akari didn&#39;t begrudge it. From the 
expression on Kagome&#39;s face, it seemed as if things weren&#39;t going to 
overwhelm her right now. Which was good. Considering the fact that she 
was stuck in a cave with someone she hardly knew, Kagome was very calm 
and reserved. At first, Akari had assumed that this was just an act that 
Kagome was putting on to keep herself under control and away from the 
madness of panic, but this proved to be false. The charmingly trusting 
and quiet nature of this girl was a part of her personality. It made 
Kagome that much more... interesting, at least in Akari&#39;s opinion. And 
when it came to women, Akari&#39;s opinion was worth quite a bit.

&quot;When we get to Tokyo.&quot; Akari began talking again. &quot;I should take you to 
a restaurant.&quot;

&quot;What one?&quot; Kagome asked.

Akari thought for a second. &quot;Hmm. Probably to Shinbunjou. They&#39;re a bit 
overpriced over there, but for a Shinjuku place, the crowd is fairly 
decent, too. Candles, lights, no smokers, and heavenly food.&quot;

&quot;It sounds wonderful.&quot;

&quot;It is.&quot; Akari confirmed, giving a brief yawn. &quot;You&#39;d enjoy it, Kagome. 
There&#39;s a real great menu in Shinbunjou. You and I should go there as 
soon as we reach Tokyo. Of course, I&#39;ll have to drag Ryoko with us, 
too.&quot;

Kagome&#39;s smile fell a tad. &quot;Who is... Ryoko?&quot;

&quot;Ryoko?&quot; Akari said slowly. &quot;She&#39;s my best bud. Hopefully I can get back 
to Tokyo quickly enough to catch up with her before...&quot;

Kagome gave Akari a questioning look when she cut herself off, 
mid-sentence, but Akari thought nothing of it. Though she trusted 
Kagome, maybe even more than she out-rightly deserved, Akari wasn&#39;t 
stupid. Revealing the truth behind Ryoko and her connection to the Asuka 
Group was dangerous, not only for Ryoko but for herself. Not to mention 
that Akari, in reality, had found Kagome inside an Asuka Group Land 
Golem. The reason behind that was still a mystery. 

&quot;Before what?&quot; Kagome asked.

Akari shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t tell you.&quot;

The brunette lowered her head again, and, like before, her smile 
dropped. &quot;You... you care a lot about Ryoko, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Akari&#39;s eyes became heavy with nostalgia. &quot;Yeah. She and I have been 
through a lot together. Through thick and thin, through good and bad, 
she&#39;s always there for me. I feel that it&#39;s my duty to protect her, as 
her friend, and as someone who knows her as well as I do. But I guess 
everyone feels like that at some point. When your friends and family 
need your support, you feel it&#39;s your duty to give it to them. 
Compassion is just a typical human weakness, I suppose.&quot;

&quot;You are a very special person to think like that.&quot; Kagome said in 
earnest. 

Akari just shook her head with a giggle. &quot;Nah, I don&#39;t think so. Once 
you get to know me better, you&#39;ll change your mind.&quot;

&quot;I hope I will get the chance.&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;re gonna be living together, won&#39;t we?&quot; It was just now that 
Akari realized how sudden a move that was, but still, she wasn&#39;t afraid 
to do it. &quot;You&#39;ll get to see how much of a slob the modern Tokyo girl 
is.&quot;

&quot;I am glad.&quot;  Kagome smiled again, and then looked over at her new 
friend. &quot;Akari...?&quot;
  
Just a bit too late. As Kagome looked over in her direction, she 
realized that Akari had just fallen asleep. The girl had nodded off, her 
body curling up along the floor. For a while, Kagome simply stared at 
the white-haired woman, watching her sleep, looking caringly at Akari&#39;s 
sleeping face. Then she noticed the slight tremble Akari endured as she 
slept. Kagome reasoned that it was due to the coldness of the winds 
outside. Without thinking, she stood up, walking past the flames of the 
fire and towards the sleeping Akari. Kagome bent down by the knees to 
look at her &#39;rescuer&#39;. 

It was obvious that Akari was very cold by the cave entrance. There was 
no way Kagome could move the fire closer to Akari or move Akari closer 
to the fire, but she mediated on a different way to keep Akari warm. 
Kagome crawled around the form of Akari, and lay down next to her, 
Akari&#39;s back to her front. With tender care she wrapped her arms around 
Akari&#39;s thin waist, and moulded her body into Akari&#39;s, their bodies 
seeming to bond together with great ease. 

Kagome wasn&#39;t completely oblivious. She knew full well how absurd this 
might seem from an outside perspective, but it didn&#39;t bother her. Akari 
was so kind and so generous, albeit a few rough edges. Keeping her warm 
was the least she could do.

It was like that that Kagome fell asleep, her arms around Akari, her 
chin resting sweetly at the shoulder of her newest friend. It was the 
first time she could truly say she felt content.

**********

&quot;What?! You failed?&quot;

Shigure yelled into his cellular. He could not believe it. Even with the 
power of the Attack Corp&#39;s mighty Land Golems and a Ground Crab, his 
mission to destroy Tokyo Blossom had ended in utter failure. It was 
ridiculous. The second in command of the Asuka Group scowled, as he held 
the phone to his ear, sitting irately in his office of the level 26 of 
the AGIST. He believed that the girl using the White Orchid, the so 
called &#39;Tokyo Blossom&#39; would die easily, breaking the ST-Link and 
allowing the Mobile Shell to be used for someone else, preferably 
someone in the Asuka Group. But as he was about to break out the 
celebratory champagne, he received a call from one of the mission 
coordinators. That person told him him that the effort was in vain.

Tokyo Blossom had survived. 

&quot;Blast you, incompetent fools!&quot; Shigure bellowed. &quot;You were armed with 
some of the most advanced technical weapons created by this company, and 
you have the nerve to tell me that you failed to defeat and retrieve the 
White Orchid? I should have you killed!&quot;

The man then gasped when he realized that... &quot;Wait a moment... what of 
Kagome? What? You lost track of her? Blast! Well... at least she&#39;s 
alive. She could not have gotten far on her own. Search that area top 
and bottom before word gets out of Kagome&#39;s disappearance. The Origin 
Scheme depends on her... without Kagome, nothing will work as we have 
intended. Over and out.&quot;

Shigure switched off the phone and sighed. It seemed that Tokyo Blossom 
was not ignorant of the Mobile Shell&#39;s true power. There were only six 
Mobile Shells, only two of which were active. Those were the White 
Orchid, the one Tokyo Blossom was using, and the Omega, the one Shigure 
was using. Though the world was scrambling over the marionette units, 
the Mobile Shells were by far the most dangerous weapon mankind have 
ever created. Their power, if misused, could destroy everything that 
humans had built in their never-ending quest to become one with God. It 
was frightening for the Asuka Group to know that someone out there had 
their top secret technology. And if word got out that the Mobile Shells 
were productions of the Asuka Group, their slowly thriving connection to 
the government moderates would probably be weakened in a haze of 
conspiracy theories and mistrust. Thankfully, only Prime Minister Kazuma 
Minakami knew fully about the Mobile Shells. The Asuka Group had been 
dealing with Minakami for years, his corruption was no new experience. 
But the immediate was a different story. It would be bad for business 
for people to know how technologically advanced the Asuka Group truly 
was. 

&quot;I have to reclaim Kagome.&quot; Shigure said sternly, stepping out of his 
chair and walking over to the wide window, overhanging the streets of 
the oblivious Shinjuku. &quot;Queen Sagi&#39;s desire will never come into being 
unless I take action. The time for messing around with the Attack Corp 
and marionettes is over. There is only one thing that can destroy a 
Mobile Shell, and that is another Mobile Shell.&quot;

Shigure&#39;s eyes glowed with intent. &quot;Be ready for Omega, Tokyo Blossom.&quot;

**********

&quot;Hmmm...&quot;

Akari sighed and moaned as rays of morning sun peered through the 
opening to the cave. They hit her face slowly, as they parted the clouds 
in the sky. The first thing she noticed as she awoke was how comfortable 
she felt. Which was odd, considering that she had slept in a cave for 
the night. Her lazy blue eyes managed to peer downwards as she felt 
pressure around her waist, and it was then that she realized that 
someone was holding her. 

Akari was just about to panic, when she looked at the wall Kagome had 
been sitting near. She wasn&#39;t there. It was then that she correctly 
guessed that the person gripping her waist was Kagome. Akari sighed, 
partly from relief and more specifically from appreciation. A keen smile 
crossed Akari&#39;s lips, as she rolled around slowly, not willing to break 
the hold that the sleeping Kagome had around her. As they came face to 
face, Akari was served another taste of that strange surging feeling in 
her body. This time it was a lot fiercer than it had previously been, 
and she started to see that this kept occurring each and every time she 
genuinely stared at Kagome. 

Akari tried hard to suppress it, but found that she couldn&#39;t. Instead 
she just went with the flow, continuing to admire the mysterious girl 
sleeping next to her. The white-haired girl pulled one of her arms away 
from her sides and reached up to Kagome&#39;s hair, stroking through the 
long brown tresses carefully and slowly. Akari continued to play with 
the girl&#39;s hair, while staring into her visage longingly. Kagome had 
such an angelic face. So innocent, sweet and gentle, those full pouting 
cheeks, those cute honey-coloured freckles, that sweet button nose. So 
much about this girl was alluring the alter ego of Tokyo B. 

It was so unusual, Akari mused, for her to be this fixed on a girl. She 
had dated a lot of girls in her time, bouncing from Tokyo nightclubs in 
Shinjuku, Akihabara and Shibuya. Normally she just hooked up one night, 
tell the girl she&#39;d give her a call (which she never did) and just kept 
things sexual. One-night stands were Akari&#39;s norm and that&#39;s all there 
was to it. At first she had believed that she was not ready for 
commitment, but then she met with Ryoko, and descended into that lengthy 
relationship. Though she cared deeply enough about Ryoko to make a 
commitment, it was not love that she felt for her. Not really. 

For the first time, Akari was feeling light-headed and bashful around a 
woman she liked, something that had never happened to her before. Not 
even Ryoko caused such a reaction in Akari, which was an amazing feat if 
you took into consideration the value Ryoko had to Akari. To know that 
Kagome was making her feel like this... it just seemed so strange to the 
blue-eyed Tokyo girl. But these feelings felt so right...

Though all her thoughts about Kagome, Akari didn&#39;t realize that her head 
was moving closer to Kagome&#39;s. All she was thinking of was how beautiful 
and gentle this girl was, so much so that it was blinding her to her own 
actions. It wasn&#39;t until her lips reached within a centimetre of 
Kagome&#39;s that she realized what she was just about to do, so 
thoughtlessly.

&quot;Crap!&quot; Akari whispered, nodding her head back. &quot;Was I really just about 
kiss Kagome like that?&quot;

Akari figured it was about time there was some distance between herself 
and Kagome, so she slowly disentangled her waist from the other girl&#39;s 
arms, and rolled away. Akari stood upright, stretching her arms a bit, 
and then she walked over to the cave entrance. She took only one look 
back at the sleeping Kagome, and suddenly felt like jelly. It had not 
escaped Akari&#39;s notice at how hard her heart was beating, or how 
apparent the dull ache between legs was becoming. 

Akari gripped her fist. &quot;I-I can&#39;t even control myself around her.&quot;

Tokyo&#39;s defender needed a distraction. And though it wasn&#39;t the kind of 
thing that she was looking for, it came to her. Akari looked out into 
the distance, squinting her eyes because of the sonically bright 
sunlight, then caught sight of what was troubling her. Armed troops, at 
least eight of them, were probing the grasslands in the far distance. 
Though Akari couldn&#39;t be sure what they were doing, she knew exactly who 
those people were working for. The Asuka Group had sent out a troop of 
private soldiers, to hunt out someone. Akari believed that she was the 
one they were searching for. 

Akari looked back at Kagome and raised her voice. &quot;Kagome! Wake up!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kagome slowly awoke through the loudness and stern voice of 
Akari. &quot;Akari? What?&quot;

Akari instantly ran over to the fire she had built last night, and put 
it out, stomping out whatever embers were left in the wasted shards of 
firewood. Kagome managed to get up, but was still confused about what 
was going on, and why Akari was looking so agitated. Though Akari had 
good reason to be. 

&quot;Dammit.&quot; Akari mumbled, so low that Kagome couldn&#39;t hear. &quot;Now that 
Kagome&#39;s with me, I can&#39;t link up with my armour. She can&#39;t know that 
I&#39;m Tokyo Blossom.&quot;

Kagome tilted her head to the left as she stared curiously at Akari. &quot;Is 
there something wrong, Akari? Did you just say something?&quot;

&quot;Yes... no... I mean.&quot; Akari could barely think straight. &quot;Look, we just 
have to get out of here, the sooner the better. I swear I&#39;ll explain as 
best I can later, but right now, we have got to book it.&quot;

Kagome nodded, still confused. &quot;Okay.&quot;

&quot;Hold it!&quot;

Akari and Kagome both turned around sharply as they heard a voice call 
out to them, from the deep innards of the cave they believed they were 
hidden in. Akari scowled when she realized that she was right about the 
cave. It had another exit, some other way to get inside. Now someone had 
gotten the drop on them, and she was pretty sure whom it had been, a 
troop for the Asuka Group. Armed with a torch and a rifle, brandishing a 
uniform in traditional gold and black colours, the standard code for 
those who worked for the Asuka Group&#39;s private military.

&quot;Okay girls.&quot; He said sneering at Kagome. &quot;This little slumber party is 
over. You are to come with us, Kagome. The will of the Asuka Group 
cannot be resisted.&quot;

&quot;Asuka Group?&quot; Kagome said blankly. &quot;What are you talking about? How do 
you know my name?&quot;

The soldier lifted his rifle, and aimed at Akari. &quot;I&#39;ll have no 
arguments! If you don&#39;t come with me now, I will kill this girl on the 
spot!&quot;

&quot;You son of a bitch!&quot; Akari spat. 

Kagome was alert. There was no way she could allow Akari to be killed 
here if there was an alternative. The young girl lowered her deep green 
eyes and stepped forward, keeping her arms respectfully at their sides. 

&quot;Please don&#39;t.&quot; Kagome said in her frail voice. &quot;I will submit myself 
you.&quot;

&quot;No, Kagome!&quot; Akari pleaded. &quot;Don&#39;t let them manipulate you!&quot;

For the first time, Kagome&#39;s tone actually sounded stern as she replied 
to Akari. &quot;I don&#39;t understand... any of this. I don&#39;t think I ever will. 
But I will not allow you to die here... like this. Not for me.&quot;

Akari growled under her breath. This was just perfect. There was 
absolutely no way she could talk Kagome out of this. But she couldn&#39;t 
call for her armour there, could she? If she summoned the White Orchid 
in this cave at that moment, both the soldier and Kagome would know the 
real identity of Tokyo Blossom. But if she didn&#39;t armour-up, Kagome 
would be taken by the Asuka Group and who knew what they might do to 
her? 

&quot;This is the last resort...&quot; Akari mumbled. &quot;I have to do this... I have 
to protect Kagome...&quot;

Akari stepped back, putting some distance between herself, Kagome and 
the soldier. She pulled up both her arms, and suddenly the air around 
her began to distort and warp. Waves of energy passed up and down 
Akari&#39;s body, shocking the soldier and Kagome. But that was nothing in 
comparison to the shock they got when Akari&#39;s body emitted a huge flash, 
illuminating the entire cave. The sounds of metal attaching to flesh 
were ringing in Kagome&#39;s ears, though she knew not of where it was 
coming from, until that blinding flash died down. Akari was gone and in 
her place was a feminine suit of futuristic armour, shining in 
beautifully polished white and sapphire, gleaming with sheen. Kagome was 
astounded, her mouth open and eyes wide, while the soldier had a shocked 
look of realization on his stout face. 

&quot;You&#39;re...&quot; He said surprised. &quot;You&#39;re... the one who activated the 
White Orchid. Tokyo Blossom!&quot;

Kagome was shocked. &quot;Tokyo Blossom? What is-?&quot;

Nothing was spoken. Tokyo B charged over at the soldier armed with the 
gun, and screamed as she landed a searing right hook, cracking his jaw 
upon contact. The man went flying into the back of the cave, slamming 
against one of its turning walls and losing consciousness as he slumped 
to the ground. Tokyo Blossom then landed and turned to Kagome, who had a 
slightly frightened expression on her beautiful face. 

&quot;Kagome.&quot; Tokyo B said. &quot;You have to find some place to hide.&quot;

Kagome&#39;s bright green eyes widened when she heard that voice. Regardless 
of how muffled it was behind the visor of that armour she knew whom that 
voice belonged to. &quot;A-Akari?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t protect you when you&#39;re out in open like this! Go and find a 
place to hide now!&quot;

The brunette nodded, taking note of the severity of Akari/Tokyo 
Blossom&#39;s tone. She dashed down into the deeper areas of the cave, she 
was sure that there would be a place for her to take cover until Tokyo 
Blossom was finished doing what she had to. Tokyo B smiled behind her 
visor, then grabbed the unconscious soldier and dragged him with her as 
she walked outside. She had to dump him somewhere away from Kagome, just 
in case he woke up and tried to capture her again. But there wasn&#39;t much 
chance for that.

As soon as Tokyo B stepped outside the cave from the front entrance, her 
sight showed her what was waiting. The eight other soldiers all lined up 
with their laser rifles at the ready, aiming directly at the cave and 
the Mobile Shell in front of it. 

&quot;Drop that officer!&quot; One of the soldiers said. &quot;Or we will open fire!&quot;

Tokyo B dropped the guy, and then brought up her palm to fire back at 
them. &quot;Open fire, huh? Give it a try and see if I don&#39;t blow you 
bastards away!&quot;

&quot;Hah! You would use your Mobile Shell against a bunch of weaklings like 
that? Your arrogance has not left you, Tokyo Blossom.&quot;

Tokyo B looked around as she heard someone say that to her. It wasn&#39;t 
one of the soldiers, but they did seem as if they knew the voice. Tokyo 
Blossom then decided to use her scanners, and tried to get the White 
Orchid&#39;s computer system to track down the voice. But still... 

&quot;It&#39;s no use.&quot;  The voice said. &quot;Scan tools don&#39;t work on this Mobile 
Shell.&quot;

Tokyo Blossom would have been more focused on that last comment if she 
had not remembered who owned that voice. &quot;I remember you. You&#39;re that 
guy from the train, the guy who set me up. You&#39;re Shigure Kagami!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; A metallic figure leapt off the roof of the cave, then 
landed down to the wet grass of the ground. Tokyo B gazed hard at 
Shigure, or rather, what he was wearing. The man known as Kagami Shigure 
was swathed in the clean polished dark green armour of a Mobile Shell, 
his hand armed with a long spear, thin and sleek at its blade. Shigure 
tapped the spear at his shoulder, staring back at a mystified Tokyo B. 
&quot;But for now, you can just call me Omega.&quot;

Omega branched out his metal covered left arm. &quot;Leave us!&quot;

All the soldiers nodded, lowered their guns then moved out, scrambling 
around the grasslands, continuing the search for Kagome. Tokyo B would 
have done something to stop them, but she got the feeling that taking 
her eyes off Omega, even for a few seconds, was a bad idea. 

&quot;So...&quot; Tokyo Blossom began. &quot;You&#39;ve got a Mobile Shell too, huh? I 
thought you were just lying when you said that before.&quot;

Omega laughed. &quot;Ha, ha, ha. Well as you can plainly see, I&#39;m not much of 
the lying type. I&#39;ll be honest with you though. I&#39;ve wanted to match 
myself with you since you robbed the power cell from the Izakawa 
warehouse in Shibuya. Anyone with the bravery to stand against a whole 
company and its illustrious leader must have the skills to support it.&quot;

Tokyo Blossom smiled behind her visor. &quot;You keep talking about this 
leader of yours. Are you going to give me a name?&quot;

&quot;If you defeat me,&quot; Omega said, readying his spear. &quot;I will reveal all.&quot;

In that instant, Omega leapt off the ground and launched himself into 
the air. Tokyo Blossom stayed alert, watching his movements as he neared 
her. As Omega came down at Tokyo&#39;s defender, he poised his long piercing 
spear for a quick and nimble strike. Tokyo B was too far ahead of him to 
miss this, and somersaulted backwards three times over. Omega&#39;s spear 
lunged into the wet grass and dirt, but did not connect with Tokyo B. 

&quot;Sucks for your aim, huh?&quot; Tokyo Blossom said confidently. 

Omega said nothing. Though she couldn&#39;t see Shigure&#39;s face behind that 
glass-like visor, Tokyo Blossom had a faint idea that he was smiling. 
Omega spun his spear around artistically, and then clasped it back into 
a striking position, the tip of its blade pointing downwards. It was now 
that Tokyo Blossom realized that the Omega suit had an external weapon, 
just like the White Orchid. Well now, Omega wasn&#39;t the only one who 
could bring out the externals, though, was he?

Tokyo Blossom reached behind her back and gripped the hilt of her sleek 
sword, the one that sliced and diced that pathetic platoon from the 
Attack Corp. She unsheathed her blade and smiled, the edge of her sword 
gleaming with light as it was freed. Tokyo B knew one thing. If she was 
going to defeat Omega, she needed to get rid of that spear he was 
carrying to give herself a good shot at him. She jumped into the air, 
just as Omega had previously done, and brought up her sword as her 
trajectory switched from upwards to downwards. Omega snickered behind 
his visor, then held up his spear horizontally, in an effort to block 
Tokyo B&#39;s impending vertical attack. She released a feminine cry and 
slashed, a flash of light quickly surging around the cold morning 
setting of the wet grasslands.

Tokyo Blossom landed, holding the grip of her sword with both hands, 
looking downwards. She was sure that a slash of that calibre would cut 
through Omega&#39;s spear without any hassle. But it appeared that she was 
gravely mistaken. Tokyo B gasped as she looked up to see that Omega&#39;s 
spear was in tact.

&quot;B-But...&quot; The girl stammered. &quot;This sword is supposed to be able to...&quot;

&quot;Cut through anything? Yes, that&#39;s true. But something can&#39;t cut through 
itself. I am Omega, the pilot of the third Mobile Shell. Our suits are 
made from the exact same material, Kowa-steel, including our external 
weapons. Fighting me won&#39;t be as easy as you believed.&quot;

Tokyo B gritted her teeth. &quot;But you&#39;ll still go down, easily or not.&quot;

&quot;So you believe...&quot;

The pilot of the White Orchid dashed back, putting some distance between 
herself and Omega. Quickly she sheathed her blade, it obviously would 
not be of use to her unless she could disarm Omega beforehand. But what 
she did do, was bring up her arm, splaying out her metal-covered fingers 
to reveal the crimson orb in the palm of her power gauntlet. If Omega 
could resist steel, Tokyo Blossom was going to see if he could resist 
pure energy. The man did not move, even though he knew full well what 
was coming, and waited for Tokyo B to fire. The girl did just that, her 
armour giving a bit of a jerk as blasts of energy shot out from her 
palm. 

Omega laughed outright, and began spinning his spear in front of him, 
creating a sort of circular shield. Each of the energy shots hit and 
were deflected by the spinning spear defence that Omega had assumed, 
knocking back the blasts directly to the sender. Tokyo B screamed as she 
was hit by her own deflected firepower, tossing her back and blasting 
her down into submission. Omega let the spinning of his spear slow into 
nothing, and then rested it against his shoulder, in a relaxed and 
un-guarded position. 

Tokyo B gritted her teeth. Part of the armour of her suit was damaged. A 
chip of metal had been broken off by the reflected wrist shots and cut 
into her skin. Though Tokyo B could still fight, her right arm was going 
to be a bit weaker. It was then that she decided to finish it all off 
and stop this &#39;Omega&#39; for good. Though this was the second battle she 
fought in a row with no system recharge, Tokyo still had about 67% of 
her energy left. That was enough juice for three hyper blasts, each of 
which absorbed 20% of her base energy. Anything more than that was out 
of the question. 

Tokyo Blossom groaned, feeling the pain of her injured arm, and 
struggled to bring herself up into a standing position. There was a 
furious glint in her eye, one that Omega could not see, but it was 
obvious to anyone that she had something big planned. Omega just 
continued to stand relaxed, not taking notice of Tokyo B&#39;s renewed 
determination. The girl fixed herself still, relaxing muscles and flesh. 
If she was too flustered, or her BP levels were too high during the 
surge that was to come, the system of the Mobile Shell would probably 
overheat. Tokyo Blossom calmed herself, watching Omega through the visor 
with soulful eyes, while he continued to watch this proceed. Then, the 
breastplates at Tokyo B&#39;s chest broke open, to reveal the energy charged 
white orb at the centre of the White Orchid&#39;s chest.

Omega&#39;s relaxed position faded but he said nothing, just grabbing his 
spear and spreading his ankles apart over the wet grass. Tokyo B kept 
calm, she didn&#39;t even bother to throw out any trash talk, and then in a 
huge bang of searing white-hot light, the blast came. 

A massive wave of pure energy blasted out from the chest plate of the 
White Orchid. It headed toward Omega and engulfed all of the area around 
him in surging ashen flames. The sounds of the explosion rocked the 
grasslands and the forests they eventually turned into, the birds and 
animals running in the opposite direction from them. A tremor was felt 
around that location, going as far back as the ruined Land Golems and 
Ground Crab that Tokyo Blossom had destroyed the previous night. 

After at least two minutes of utter destruction, the Hyper Blast came to 
an end, the white light fading into the nothingness from which it sprang 
forth. What was left it its wake had vanished equally, the former wet 
grass and mud replaced by a smoking trench carved into the ground by the 
focus of the energy shot. The trench was three metres wide and at least, 
twenty metres long, the kind of reaction Tokyo Blossom had expected. 
What was even greater was that Omega had vanished along with the grass 
and dirt, there wasn&#39;t a trace left of him. Tokyo Blossom sighed; her 
breastplates shutting back together automatically.  

&quot;So, you&#39;ve unlocked the power of the Hyper Blast, eh?&quot;

Tokyo B&#39;s eyes went wide. She searched for the direction of that voice, 
but came up with nothing, until she looked upwards. There, hovering at 
least 35 feet in the air, was Omega, his arms crossed and his spear 
between them. 

Tokyo Blossom couldn&#39;t believe it. &quot;How did you escape the... how are 
you...&quot;

&quot;Flying?&quot; Omega filled in from above. &quot;I must say that it astounds me 
how little you really know about the power of the Mobile Shells. Do you 
really think that we would go to such lengths to retrieve the White 
Orchid for the simple fun of it?&quot;

Tokyo Blossom didn&#39;t respond. She was too shocked by the failure of the 
Hyper Blast. It was the first time that something had survived it. If 
her ultimate attack couldn&#39;t stop Omega, what else could she possibly 
do?

Omega noticed the hesitation in Tokyo B. &quot;I see you&#39;ve exhausted all 
your possibilities. You should know that there are other weapons 
available to the Mobile Shells, besides the ones you know how to use. 
But I suppose you don&#39;t have a clue about them either. Ah well. I 
respect that you have lasted this long against me, since it is obvious 
that you have had no previous training. So at least you should feel 
honoured by this defeat!&quot;

Tokyo B was in shock. In a blink of an eye, Omega was gone. The only 
time she even realized that he was still around was when she felt a 
searing pain in her shoulder. Something had cut through the metal and 
slashed into her flesh, then disappeared again without a trace. Tokyo 
Blossom couldn&#39;t understand what was going on, till it happened again.

&quot;Ahh!&quot; She cried, as sleek metal sliced into the tender skin below the 
armour. Her scanners just about managed to catch on to what was 
happening. Omega was swooping around her with that spear, slashing at 
her again as he passed by, zooming back up into the air. Tokyo B was 
astounded. Those thrusters that gave Omega his flight ability were so 
fast that the White Orchid&#39;s scanners could barely keep up with him. 
Tokyo Blossom screamed once more as Omega&#39;s spear slashed at her leg in 
lightning fast speeds, so fast that to the naked eye, it was invisible. 
The girl fell to one knee, unable to stand on that leg anymore. Omega 
flew around once more, still holding his spear. But this time he did not 
attack Tokyo Blossom with it, instead he rammed his whole body into her 
back. Tokyo B was pushed forwards, over the wide ditch that her Hyper 
Blast had made, and was slammed into a huge rock face, one that was 
attached to the cave. 

&quot;Oof!&quot; Tokyo B cringed, as she was smashed against the tough rock, and 
then fell limply into the ground. Omega was wiping the floor with her. 
But whether he was or he wasn&#39;t, there was not much Tokyo Blossom could 
do to respond. Her right arm and left leg were both injured, it was 
going to be hard enough to walk, let alone fight. And she had still not 
forgotten that she was in the middle of nowhere. 

A powerful hand gripped Tokyo B&#39;s metallic neck, pulling her off the 
ground, her limbs dangling in the air. It was Omega, who was hovering 
himself, just a few inches off the grassy land. Tokyo B could hear his 
laughter, but made no snappy comeback or threat. She knew she was in a 
bad way, and Omega had the edge. 

&quot;So this is the might of the White Orchid.&quot; Omega sneered. &quot;I suppose 
you just haven&#39;t grasped its true power. Or maybe, just maybe, Queen 
Sagi overestimated you.&quot;

&quot;Q-Queen... Sagi...?&quot; Tokyo B asked clumsily. 

Omega growled irritably, and then punched Tokyo B with a furious strike, 
right across the jaw of her headgear. Though the metal of the armour 
absorbed most of the damage, Tokyo B still felt the shockwaves of the 
blow. It was like she had been smacked with a brick. 
 
While Tokyo B&#39;s head hung limply, Omega now gripped her neck with two 
hands. &quot;I told you, that you are not worthy to speak the name of our 
glorious leader. Scum like you have no business even living in the world 
she exists in.&quot;

Using just one of those mammoth hands, Omega thrust Tokyo Blossom back 
into the wall, the sound of rocks and dust being shattered was now the 
trademark sound in her ears. The defeated girl slumped back down into 
the ground, rubble and pebbles clattering against the metal of her suit. 
The cuts that Tokyo B had sustained during Omega&#39;s swooping slashes were 
now bleeding profusely, so much so that blood began to leak through the 
armour for Omega to see. They both knew that no more resistance could be 
made. 

Omega brought up his spear, spinning it around so that its blade tip was 
only a few centimetres from Tokyo B&#39;s neck. One direct blow through the 
neck was fatal. But Tokyo Blossom knew that there was nothing she could 
do to stop him. Her three years of battle, of struggle, it all ended 
here. After all that agony, her mother&#39;s death would never be avenged. 

&quot;Aren&#39;t you gonna... finish me?&quot; Tokyo Blossom asked. 

Omega laughed once more. &quot;I really should, shouldn&#39;t I? After all, the 
Asuka Group could finish all our troubles with your death. But I must 
admit, you have amused me today.&quot;
 
Omega withdrew his spear, and pressed both of his legs fully to the 
ground. He turned his back to Tokyo Blossom, walking away from the 
downed fighter, much to her surprise. 

&quot;Wait...&quot; Tokyo Blossom struggled to say. 

Omega did not look back. &quot;Fool. You cannot defeat me. But I enjoyed 
fighting you. If you improve your skills and make it back to Tokyo 
alive, I would relish a second duel. But for now, you may live.&quot;

Bastard. Tokyo Blossom couldn&#39;t stand the idea of being bested like 
this. But all her concerns shifted to another angle when she heard a 
young girlish voice, muffled by something. The armed soldiers walked out 
of the cave with Kagome, her mouth gagged and her arms tied. And her 
eyes filled with wetness when she saw Tokyo Blossom, downed and 
bleeding. 

&quot;K-Kagome!&quot; Tokyo Blossom yelled difficultly. &quot;L-Let her go...&quot;

Omega watched on as Kagome was taken with the soldiers. &quot;She is ours. 
You needn&#39;t concern yourself with her. Just make sure you are back in 
fighting form before our next encounter. Mercy isn&#39;t something I offer 
twice.&quot;
                                         
Thin drops of water suddenly rained down from the skies. Before long 
this drizzle became a downpour. In the same way rain hit the ground, the 
hopelessness of the situation fell on Tokyo Blossom. She had been 
defeated, her first real loss since she established the ST Link with the 
White Orchid. The thrusters that Omega had poised beneath the feet of 
his armour, suddenly surged to life, and pushed him upwards into the 
air, leaving the weakened Tokyo Blossom below him. The soldiers carried 
a despair-filled Kagome to a nearby parking of three trucks, then began 
to make there way out of the area. Omega watched them leave, as they 
headed towards the main road that led back to Tokyo. He sped after them, 
mid-flight, jetting over the grasslands like a bird on the winds. Tokyo 
Blossom looked up and watched him leave, her fist shaking with rage. 

Kagome was gone. 

Rather than berate herself about it, Tokyo B lifted her undamaged arm 
and tapped the button on the corner of her headgear. The button that 
held the COM link with Ryoko. The frequency was jammed when the train 
had revealed itself to be a trap last night, but it had been working 
ever since. The only reason she hadn&#39;t contacted Ryoko was because of 
Kagome.

&quot;R-Ryoko...?&quot; 

Ryoko was irate. &quot;Akari! You&#39;re just contacting me now? Where the hell 
have you been!? I&#39;ve been so worried about you!&quot;

&quot;... R-Ryoko...&quot;

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Ryoko picked up on the idea that something was amiss 
when she heard Tokyo Blossom/Akari&#39;s voice sounding so downcast and 
tired. &quot;What happened?&quot;
 
&quot;R-Ryoko.&quot; She replied. &quot;You&#39;ve... gotta come get me...&quot;

&quot;Where are you? Akari? Akari!&quot;

It was too late. She was already slipping into unconsciousness due to 
the blood loss.

**********

&quot;Akari... listen to me, dear.&quot;

Fire surged up from the rubble of the wasted buildings. Smoke floated 
along and around the blaze. Man and women screamed as their flesh roiled 
in the heat. What they thought was sweat was actually peeled skin, being 
stripped off by the surging fire around. The throws of destruction 
surrounded poor Akari, but her mind was on none of it, not even the 
destruction of her home. All she was aware of was her mother, Asuka 
Minako, lying down on the now warm stone ground of this secluded 
Shinjuku street. 

Akari watched Asuka shut one of her eyes, and grip down on the bloody 
wound at her waist. The cut was so deep that the blood was actually 
darkening, and the intense heat brought along by the flames only made 
the situation worse. Asuka groaned then lowered her head onto a 
shattered rock, some brief relief from all the carnage created by the 
Izubata Company and its ridiculous marionette drones. She had managed to 
drive them all away with the White Orchid suit, but the damage done to 
her home and the surrounding district was beyond her ability to stop. 
Though people were dying all around her, the only thing she could think 
of was her sweet innocent daughter, Akari. There was such a look of fear 
and desperation in her eyes. Though Asuka had fought to keep this kind 
of horror from her daughter, this was inevitable. A 15-year-old girl 
exposed to this madness. It was like a never-ending nightmare.

Asuka reached up, her hand covered in her own blood, and gently rubbed 
away the tears that were soiling her daughter&#39;s eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t cry, 
sweetie. You have to be strong for your mother.&quot;

&quot;Mom!&quot; Akari broke into more tears, clutching at her mother&#39;s hand. 
&quot;You&#39;re dying, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Asuka smiled briefly. &quot;We all have to die in the end, Akari. It&#39;s a part 
of life you must face. It just happens to be my time now.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to go now!&quot; Akari yelled sadly. &quot;I need you with me, 
mom!&quot;

&quot;You are stronger than you think. I have faith that you can keep 
yourself together. But... we have no time for this. You have to listen 
to what I tell you.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;
  
Asuka gripped Akari&#39;s hand tighter. &quot;Akari, there is a duty ahead of you 
that only you can fulfil. It was my task to do, and unfortunately, I 
can&#39;t keep it up any longer.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about, mom?&quot;

&quot;Look over to your right.&quot;

Akari did just that, slowly at first. She looked just briefly to a 
distance around five metres away from herself and her mother. Standing 
proud and strong amid all the fire, ash and smoke, was a huge futuristic 
suit of full body armour, sleek, tall, radiating a powerful blue aura. 
Akari was transfixed by the blue and white metal, the glimmering sheen 
and mesmerized by the simple fact that it was untouched by all this 
destruction. 

Asuka watched the awe in Akari&#39;s eyes. &quot;It is called the White Orchid 
Mobile Shell. That is what I have been using to protect you all these 
years. But I fear I can protect you no longer.&quot;

Akari looked back at her mom. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Akari...&quot; Asuka began. &quot;There are things you need to know. For most of 
my life and yours, I have been working with a group called the Izubata 
Company. I believed that they were going to help me fulfil my research 
into advanced forms of AI. And they were, but their plans for my 
technology were too horrible to imagine. I was too deep into the 
nightmare to escape as I was. But I had an angle. An angle that gave me 
power to resist the Izubata. And that angle is that White Orchid. I was 
a part of that blasted Mobile Shell project, conducted so many years 
ago, when I was just a teenager. It was the dying wish of Daigo Izubata, 
the former head of the Izubata Company. I was one of the six people who 
were first tested.&quot;

&quot;Tested?&quot; Akari said slowly.

Asuka nodded. &quot;Yes. My form of AI was still in its infancy back then. 
Due to the war in Korea, we were expected to create a powerful new 
weapon to use on the battlefield of war. I helped to design those 
destructive suits of armour, called Mobile Shells. All of the people 
involved were requested to test these suits of armour, even... even the 
daughter of the one in charge. We were all biologically advanced to cope 
with the stress brought on by the armour, but I was the only one who 
passed these tests. I was the only one in the world who was able to 
pilot one of those suits. Despite their awesome power, they were 
regarded as useless, because only I could pilot it. So they were 
abandoned. For sixteen years I carried that enormous burden. But when I 
learned of the Izubata Company&#39;s true intentions... I had to use that 
power against them.&quot;

&quot;Mom?&quot; Akari became concerned when she heard her mother&#39;s voice get 
weaker.

&quot;Be strong...&quot; She continued. &quot;Be strong, Akari. You must hear this. I 
have been battling the Izubata Company for so long. I have had to 
protect you with all I had and I can&#39;t do it anymore. But you can.&quot;

Akari looked away. &quot;I don&#39;t understand any of this!&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. But it is the truth. You can pilot the White Orchid, 
Akari. Since you were born after my augmentation, it naturally follows 
that you inherited those characteristics from me. You have to pilot that 
weapon, and stop the Izubata Company, before they bring a horror into 
this world.&quot;

&quot;Horror?&quot;

Asuka eyes began to fade, her hand shaking. &quot;Stop them... please...&quot;
 
&quot;Mom?&quot; Akari cried. &quot;Please don&#39;t leave me! I love you!&quot;

Hard as it was, Asuka managed a smile. &quot;I love you too, Akari. But... I 
also loved someone else... and it was because of my love for that 
person... that things have gotten this far. You must defeat her and the 
Izubata Company... use the White Orchid and do everything in your power 
to destroy their plans. I know you will do this for me... and I know 
you&#39;ll make me proud. Goodbye, my dear Akari...&quot;

The hand in that was in Akari&#39;s grip stopped shaking. &quot;Mom? No! Don&#39;t 
leave me! Mom!&quot;

**********

Akari opened her eyes slowly. The first thing she noticed was how warm 
she felt. When she looked down at herself, she saw that she was not 
wearing her armour anymore. The wounds she had taken from Omega had been 
taped up with some white bandages. She also noticed the safety belt 
around her chest. When she looked to her left she saw Ryoko, driving 
slowly, smiling at her with some relief. She was inside Ryoko&#39;s car, 
driving along the main road, the one that lead back into Tokyo.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re finally awake.&quot; Ryoko said cheerfully. &quot;How do you 
feel?&quot;

Akari sighed. &quot;Like crap. I&#39;ve never taken such a beating, Ryoko.&quot;

&quot;What happened out there?&quot;

Akari shook her head. &quot;First things first. How did you find me?&quot;

&quot;I used a tracker to follow the signal of your suit&#39;s COM link.&quot; Ryoko 
explained. &quot;It took me a few hours but I finally found you. It was a 
lucky break that you passed out leaving the COM link open. It was even 
luckier that the Mobile Shell didn&#39;t disassemble either. If it had done, 
you&#39;d have probably bled to death.&quot;

&quot;Thanks... I owe you.&quot; 

Ryoko shook her head, looking out at the road. &quot;Nah. You&#39;ve saved my 
butt so many times it isn&#39;t funny. So... are you going to tell me about 
what happened or what?&quot;

&quot;I got to the train.&quot; Akari began. &quot;But it was a trap. The CFL chip was 
never really there.&quot;

Ryoko lowered her head. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t think my information 
was-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not blaming you.&quot; Akari said haltingly. &quot;Anyway, it was a trap. 
They took me outside the city, and set some army-grade weapons on me. 
They came from something called the Attack Corp.&quot;

&quot;The Attack Corp?&quot; Ryoko said shocked. &quot;That&#39;s the Asuka Group&#39;s prized 
private army. I had no idea that they would use something like that on 
you.&quot;

&quot;It didn&#39;t get them very far. I smashed all of them.&quot; Akari answered.

Ryoko tried to keep her eyes on the road. &quot;So then... how...?&quot;

&quot;I was just about to finish the last one, I think it was a Land Golem, 
and then I found this girl sleeping inside it. Her name was... Kagome.&quot; 

&quot;Kagome?&quot;

Akari looked at Ryoko. &quot;You know her?&quot;

&quot;No, but it&#39;s a name that has come around more than once. I&#39;m not an 
executive in the Asuka Group so I don&#39;t know any of its major projects, 
but Kagome does sound familiar.&quot;

&quot;Well, whatever.&quot; Akari looked back into the road. &quot;She and I hid out in 
a cave for the night. I thought I could take her to Tokyo with me 
safely, but as soon as we woke up, some of the soldiers, for the Attack 
Corps I guess, spotted us. It would have been easy to fight them off, 
but then...&quot;

&quot;...But then?&quot; Ryoko questioned.

&quot;But then Omega, some guy using a Mobile Shell came, and he kicked my 
ass.&quot; Akari said irritably. &quot;He and the soldiers took Kagome and now I 
don&#39;t know where the hell she is.&quot;

&quot;Did... Kagome see you transform?&quot; Ryoko asked. 

Akari nodded. &quot;Yeah. Why?&quot;

&quot;Well... the Asuka Group might question her and ask about your identity. 
All they have to do interrogate her for a while and then they&#39;ve got 
you.&quot;

Akari didn&#39;t notice how her heart sped up from thinking of that 
mysterious girl, the beautiful Kagome. &quot;She wouldn&#39;t do that. I trust 
her.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but...&quot;

It was then that Akari became angry. &quot;I said she wouldn&#39;t do that! I 
trust Kagome! So just drop it, Ryoko.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; Ryoko&#39;s eyes were wide. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

Akari said nothing to that. She just looked back out the window, to the 
outside. The rain had not stopped, and cars passed by them quickly, 
probably to get to Tokyo fast before the rain started to set it. Ryoko 
looked over at Akari. There was something different about her since 
yesterday. And, it seemed to have something to do with this &#39;Kagome&#39; 
girl.

&quot;What was she like?&quot; Ryoko asked.

&quot;Huh? You mean Kagome?&quot; Akari&#39;s mind ran a mile a minute. &quot;She was... 
very interesting. I can honestly say I&#39;ve never met anyone like her. She 
was so calm and so mild, so gentle.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you have feelings for her.&quot; Ryoko said sarcastically.

Though that was said in humour, Akari didn&#39;t take it that way. &quot;Maybe I 
do.&quot;

Ryoko giggled like a little girl. &quot;You&#39;re kidding me, right?&quot;

Akari shook her head. &quot;No. No i&#39;m not.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Ryoko was a little confused by that earnest response. &quot;You just 
met her, Akari.&quot;

&quot;I think I know that. I just... its not like how it was with my other 
girlfriends, or even with you. It&#39;s different, it&#39;s special.&quot;

Ryoko chuckled grimly. &quot;So I wasn&#39;t special to you, huh?&quot;

&quot;Oh come on, you know I don&#39;t mean it like that.&quot; Akari defended 
herself. &quot;My feelings for Kagome are just different, that&#39;s all.&quot;

Ryoko tried not to blow things out of proportion. Just because Akari was 
the love of her life, it didn&#39;t necessarily work both ways. &quot;Well, I 
guess. So what do we do now? The Asuka Group knows they have a spy in 
their ranks, me, they have Kagome and the CFL chip, and you&#39;re all 
banged up. What&#39;s the next move?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; However, there was a strong resolve in Akari&#39;s bright 
lively eyes when she added, &quot;But I do know one thing. I&#39;m gonna get 
Kagome back.&quot;

**********

&quot;Greetings, my queen.&quot;

Queen Sagi looked upon Shigure with pride. Though she was disturbed to 
hear of the utter defeat of the Attack Corps unit that had been sent 
into battle, she was pleased to hear of Shigure&#39;s success. Though she 
doubted that even Tokyo Blossom had a chance against Shigure and the 
Omega Mobile Shell. He had been fully trained to resist and defeat all 
enemies to the Asuka Group. He was given the Omega Mobile Shell shortly 
after the Izubata Company renamed itself into the Asuka Group, three 
years ago. Therefore he had mastered all of its powers and abilities, 
making him Queen Sagi&#39;s most loyal and most powerful soldier.

But her mind was not centred on her strongest soldier, but rather the 
girl next to him. 

Kagome. 

The brunette had been stripped of her Asuka Group Combat uniform, and 
had been redressed in a loose white dress, nothing flashy but it 
probably wasn&#39;t supposed to be. Though she was being held here against 
her will, there were no shackles or handcuffs on her; she was free to 
move around as she pleased. But though she was free, Kagome knew better 
than to think she wasn&#39;t a prisoner. Kagome didn&#39;t even know why they 
wanted her, she had no memory of anything. But what she did have, was a 
stern sense of... connection to the wondrous Queen Sagi, her powerful 
aura felt somehow familiar.

Queen Sagi smiled at Kagome. &quot;Welcome to the AGIST, Kagome. I have 
longed to see you all these months... you have no idea...&quot;
 
&quot;Do you know me?&quot; Kagome asked. 

Queen Sagi still smiled at her. &quot;You are very beautiful, Kagome, and 
intelligent to boot. Though you look slightly different than I would 
have imagined. I suppose that is to be expected. Things never quite come 
out the way we plan them do they?&quot;

&quot;Answer me!&quot; Kagome yelled. &quot;You know me, don&#39;t you? Why don&#39;t I have 
any memories of my life? Why have you brought me here? Please just tell 
me!&quot;

&quot;Patience.&quot; Queen Sagi declared. &quot;I will reveal everything to you on 
that hallowed day, the day when you and I shall meet with our destinies. 
When the stars are in alignment... and the moon looks down upon us with 
glee... you will know everything.&quot;

Kagome was strangely curious. &quot;The hallowed day?&quot;

&quot;Shigure.&quot; Queen Sagi said firmly. &quot;Take my... take Kagome to her 
quarters. It has been a long day and she needs rest in preparation for 
our plans.&quot;

Shigure nodded. &quot;Yes, my queen.&quot; 

Kagome was grasped by the arm and brought along with Shigure, towards 
the far exit of this large room. But she couldn&#39;t help throwing looks 
back at Queen Sagi. She felt a connection to her, but couldn&#39;t place it. 
What did mean? But, regardless of any connection, Kagome&#39;s main worry 
was Akari. What happened to her? How did she transform into that huge 
walking battle suit? Was she okay? Although though Kagome had no real 
idea of Akari&#39;s well being, she know that the white-haired girl was 
alive. She could... feel it.
