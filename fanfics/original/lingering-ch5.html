<h1>A Shadowlander's Tale: The Lingering Shadows Within (part 5 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/lingering-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>I awoke to find myself surround by towering stark white curtain pulled 
around a ridged metal  hospital bed. I quickly sat up and clenched at my 
chest to find myself in a pale blue hospital gown. Anxiety filled my 
heart as memories of being back in that mental hospital entered my mind. 
Hastily I checked my wrists to find no bounds held me in place and no 
bandaged covered my arms, only a medical bracelet was attached to my 
right arm bearing my name. A tube stuck out of my left arm to an IV bag 
and my leg was neatly bandaged with a metal splint to hold the bone in 
place, but other then that there was no sign of the old hospital that I 
had spent so much time at as a child. I glanced down at my leg and 
winced at the sight before me. I could see blood seeping through the 
bindings, however I felt absolutely no pain what so ever. I figured they 
had given me something to deaden the pain, no matter how much they gave 
me there should have been a slight bit of pain.

I was not sure how long I was out for, but it could not have been that 
long. I searched the room for any sign of a clock, however the curtain 
blocked my view of the rest of the room so all I could see was the tiny 
night table next to my bed and the lamp attached to the wall above my 
head. I suspected that I was sharing the room with some other patients, 
considering the fact that I was not that special to gain my own room. I 
glanced down at the gown they had covered me in and I wondered where my 
clothes had gotten too. I needed to help search for Beth and I could not 
stay in this place for long. 

I rolled off the bed and used the IV pole for balance as I hobbled 
around the bed. I found a blue house coat hanging on a hook next to the 
bed and carefully pulled it on, then turned to investigate my 
surroundings. Just as I was about to pull the curtain back I heard the 
sounds of a small child&#39;s laughter, then a small shadow darted around 
the curtain. I felt my body freeze in place as fear filled my heart, I 
could not understand why I would be so frightened, it was only a child 
after all, but something told me to back away from that curtain. As I 
did the shadow of a small hand appeared before me and ran along the 
white material. It slowly moved passed me and then abruptly stopped, 
almost as if it sensed my presence. I clenched the housecoat tight 
around my neck and bid a silent prayer. Then I realized that there was 
no one to hear my prayers and shook my head at the helpless feeling that 
swam its way through my mind. Suddenly the shadow disappeared, as if 
something else had attracted its attention and I heard the sound of tiny 
feet running out of the room. 

Quickly I vanquished my fears and pulled the curtain back to find no one 
there. I glanced around a couple of time to see that curtains had been 
drawn around every bed. I figured there were maybe three beds per side, 
but it was hard to say with those curtains waving in a soft breeze that 
emitted from an open window at the end of the room. A window that showed 
me it was still nightfall outside, so maybe I&#39;d only been out for a few 
hours, or maybe the sun had fallen on yet another day. I had no time to 
worry about such things and prepared to leave the room when I felt 
something unusual under my bear foot. 

I glanced down to see that there was a small square piece of paper 
laying upon the ground under the heel of my foot, or what I figured was 
paper. I bent over, with great difficulty I can tell you, and picked up 
the paper. It turned out to be a photograph and as I turned it over I 
observed that it was a picture of my niece. A photo that could only have 
been taken long before the little girl went missing. She was sitting in 
a high back chair, clad in a hospital gown and there were many strange 
looking wires coming from her head. The worst part had to be the 
expression upon her face. Her cheeks were tear streaked and she appeared 
to be crying out to someone as she struggled with her restraints. The 
mere sight of the photo sent a wave of sadness through me. What were 
they doing to her? Why didn&#39;t my sister tell me about any of this? More 
over how could such a photo appear here of all places? 

I don&#39;t know why I thought my sister would tell me anything about this. 
I&#39;d not seen her for years before her appearance at my office. She was 
shaken and I could see anger in her eyes. An anger that she quickly set 
upon me. Everyone know about my nightmares as a child and everyone 
thought I was just insane. My sister refused to have anything to do with 
me after my release from the hospital, stating that I would spread my 
disease to her child. I&#39;m not sure if she meant my gayness or my 
sleeping troubles, but it turned out that the sleeping problems were to 
appear even without me being around. My sister demanded me to find her 
child, that it was my fault for her little girl having so many issues. 
I&#39;d only seen the girl in photos for the most part and something about 
the look in the girl&#39;s eyes called out to me. There was a depth of 
sadness under those long blonde bangs that seeped out of every photo. In 
one photo particularly I could see a shadowy figure linger behind the 
child and that was enough for me to take on my annoying sister&#39;s case. 

I gazed at the photo in my hand once again. I should have known my 
sister would have taken her child to this place, just as my parents had. 
I felt sorry for the child and wished I could take her into my arms and 
whisk her away from that place the held her captive. Then a thought 
occurred to me. What is she was still at that hospital? I had not 
thought of looking there because my sister insisted that she had not 
taken the child to see any doctors. She turned out to be as much a liar 
as my dear mother. 

The giggles of a child tore me from my thoughts with a start. This time 
my curiosity over came my fears and moved as rapidly as I could to the 
door of my room, placing the photo protectively in the house coat 
pocket. The bright light of the hallway hurt my eyes and I squinted 
against it as I searched for any sign of who could have dropped this 
photo. Then I spotted a small girl in a long white nightgown and long 
blonde hair dart into one of the rooms to my left. Clenching tight to my 
IV pole, and using a railing that ran along the hallway walls, I 
carefully moved towards the room that the child disappeared into. I took 
note of the small black plaque on the door with its white letters, 
&quot;W6-A4&quot; it read. Something about that number seemed oddly familiar and 
scratched at the surface of my mind. Not being able to recall what the 
numbers meant I decided to forgo it for now and push on forwards. 

I found the door to room &quot;W6-A4&quot; wide open as if someone were inviting 
me to enter. Cautiously peeking into the room, for the most part it was 
bare of anything, aside from a large wooden bed in the centre of the 
room. Uncertainty filled my heart, but the need to learn more about 
where this photo came from and the fact that there might be a clue to my 
nieces disappearance made me force my legs to enter the room. 

As I moved into the room I could tell that the bed was made of a 
polished red oak, not the type of bed you would find in a hospital that 
was for certain. The head board was large and curved along the top with 
elaborate carvings along its surface. Four rounded bed posts rose up 
around the bed to about breast height at each of the corners. I admired 
the smooth surface of the wood as I set my hand upon one of the balled 
tips. Whoever made this bed payed close attention to their craft and I 
could feel that they put their heart and soul into making this bed. 
Finally I moved my attention from the frame to the centre of the bed. 
There was thin white sheet draped over the bed and I could see something 
moving underneath its surface. The figure seemed to be squirming against 
the cloth as if it held them in place. An open window caused the sheets 
to flutter about in a surreal manner and for a moment I thought I could 
see a hand peek out from under the sheet, hanging over the edge of the 
mattress. 

I stepped around the bed, unsure what it was doing in there, but unable 
to turn away. Something about the movements of those sheets mesmerized 
me and I could not pull my eyes away from it. I approached the side of 
the bed and tried to gather the strength to peek under that sheet when I 
noticed a small pool of blood began to form at the edges of the bed and 
drip down the sides of the sheets. My fears were suddenly replaced with 
a need to help whomever was beneath that cloth and I shook away the 
transfixed feeling that has entrapped my mind. Without further 
hesitation I reached out and pulled the sheet off in one swift movement. 
I was startled to find the bed was completely empty aside from four 
large blood stains, two near the foot of the bed and two more at either 
side. 

Curiously, I inspected the stains and lightly dabbed my pinky finger in 
the centre to find it was still fresh, warm even. Upon placing my finger 
under my nose and sniffed at the substance. As my nostrils filled with a 
sweet coppery scent it verified, for me at least, that it truly was 
blood. The very fact that the blood had not entirely soaked into the bed 
and had not even begun to harden told me that whomever this bed belonged 
to had not been gone very long ago. I&#39;d say about thirty minutes or so 
tops, but I could be wrong about that. I was not a expert on crime scene 
investigation but I have read my fair share over the years to know that 
blood would not be pooled up on the bed like this if it had been longer 
then a few hours. 

Anxiously, I glanced down at the bottom of the bed to find restraints 
had been attached to the underside of the bed&#39;s frame. The sight of 
which caused me to think back to the days of my night terrors and how my 
own parents would strap me down to the bed in an attempt to stop me from 
flailing about and a shudder filled me as I recalled the way the 
bindings would bite into my flesh. Whomever this bed was meant for the 
maker did not wish for them to escape during their sleep. Could this bed 
have been made for a sleepwalker? The thought that someone would strap 
their child down at night was unsettling to me. Again I recalled the way 
the leather would cut into my wrists and my eyes returned to the blood. 
Could mere restraints cause that much blood? I was not certain, but I 
felt a need to seek whomever this bed belonged to and get them medical 
attention. 

I was about to move away from the bed when my eyes noticed something odd 
about the restraints and I rushed around the bed to check out the other 
side, paying close attention to the foot shackles as I passed the foot 
of the bed. Each were leather with large metal buckles fastened tightly 
in place. This was what I found unusual. If the person escaped then why 
were the restraints still fastened? I knelt next to the other arm 
shackle to find that it too was still secure. How was it possible for 
someone to free themselves without unbuckling at least one of their 
restraints. 

As I pondered this I spotted a smeared bloody hand print upon the white 
tile floor below the dangling restraint and something white laying near 
it. I carefully picked up the object to discover it was a fingernail, 
not a clipping but an full nail, maybe that of a child. I hastily 
dropped the nail back to the ground as a wave of uneasy filled my 
stomach. Why would there be a finger nail laying upon the ground? My eye 
drifted to a set of marks around the hand print, four long claw marks as 
if someone had been trying to grip the ground as they were pulled under 
the bed and that was when I noticed it. Something under the bed stirred 
and a pair of dark eyes stared out from the shadows at me. I froze in 
place as I gazed into those deep eyes, eye of some kind of monster that 
only existed within a child&#39;s nightmares. I was far from a child any 
longer so why would I be seeing this thing? More so why was the mere 
sight of this creature causing my heart to race with fright. 

I fled from the beast, if you could call it flight, it was more like I 
scrambled upon the floor in an attempt to gain some distance between 
myself and that bed. I tried to get to my feet, but forgot that my leg 
was in a splint and could not get it to work for me. The beast snarled 
at me and I could see a large clawed hand slip out from under the bed 
and move towards me. I let out a childishly horrified scream as it 
reached out towards me. I turned and scrambled out of the room, slamming 
the door quickly behind myself, cutting my IV off in the door. I pulled 
the needle from my arm, ignoring the small spirt of blood that ran down 
my arm, and crawled back to my room when a nurse came running down the 
hall towards me. 

&quot;Miss. Bakerson!?!&quot; The nurse called out, startled by my presence in the 
hall. 

I ignored the woman as I continued my way down the hall. I wanted out of 
that place and away from whatever was in that room. 

The nurse grabbed me by the arm and forced me up against the wall, 
&quot;Miss, Bakerson!!&quot; She shouted at me this time, like I was some kind of 
child, &quot;What are you doing out here? What are you running from?&quot; She 
exclaimed, her eyes fell on the blood that had formed on my hospital 
gown and stared in bewilderment, &quot;What happened to you? 

I shakily pointed at the door, &quot;S... shadows...&quot; was about all I could 
muster. I really did feel like a child again and I hated it. Where was 
all the collectiveness that I&#39;d gained over the pasted five years? What 
happened to that bold Private Eye? Where was she? I called out inside of 
my head, but there was no answer.

Another nurse, a younger one this time, came running down the hall 
towards us and I shrank against the wall. The first nurse turned to the 
young woman and pointed at the door I&#39;d just exited, &quot;I&#39;ll handle this. 
You check in there. Something really shook this woman up something 
furious.&quot; 

The younger nurse nodded and opened the door to the room. The moment she 
gazed beyond that door I could see the colour drain from her skin and 
she placed a hand to her quivering mouth. 

&quot;What is wrong?&quot; The first nurse called out, but got no response, &quot;You 
stay right here.&quot; She commanded of me as she let me go and rushed over 
to the other nurses side. The second she looked into the room she 
quickly turned away with a hand over her mouth. She shook her head as if 
she were trying to force the image out of her head. Then she quickly 
moved away from the door, &quot;We have to find Doctor Jakes.&quot; She stated as 
she rushed to the front desk and picked up the phone. 

Suddenly the intercom overhead sprung to life as the nurse&#39;s voice rang 
out over them, &quot;Dr. Jakes to ward 6. Dr. Jakes to ward 6.&quot; 

Ward 6? My mind raced and I glanced around to find a sign above the 
nurses station. &quot;Psychiatric In Patient Ward 6&quot; It read. What was I 
doing back here in the psycho ward? I only broke my leg, didn&#39;t I? I 
struggled to get to my feet and frantically rubbed at the sides of my 
head. This had to be all a dream. There was no way I could be back here. 
It was impossible. There was no reason to send me here. 

The nurse rushed back to me, with a quick glance into that room again, 
then stopped in front of me, &quot;Miss. Bakers, What happened in there?&quot; She 
inquired sternly. For the first time I actually got a look at the woman 
and remembered her from my days in Ward 6 all those years ago. Mrs. 
Helder was her name and she had a nasty reputation for being strict and 
cold. I recalled her once telling me how she wished that she was allowed 
to go back to the old days of using shock therapy, because it would 
teach us a few manners. The sight of this old wrinkled woman set a fire 
within my mind. I never hated human in my life, but this woman was not 
human in my eyes. She was a vicious demon that gained pleasure from 
children&#39;s sorrow and pain. I hated her with every part of my being and 
the mere sight of her withered old face made me feel like reaching out 
and strangling the women. 

I raised my head and glared at the woman, &quot;What am I doing here?&quot; I 
inquired with as much calm as I could muster, trying hard to hide my 
frustration and anger of the situation . 

The nurse seemed startled by my question and I thought I saw her take a 
step back from me, &quot;Don&#39;t you remember?&quot; She asked lightly, as if she 
were talking to a hostile patient or something along those lines. 

I shook my head, &quot;I remember going to the club and trying to help Beth 
and then I hurt my leg on the back stairs and I was brought here.&quot; I 
explained simply. 

The nurse let out a displeased sigh, &quot;Maybe you should wait here until 
Dr. Jakes arrives.&quot; She suggested, gesturing to a chair across from my 
room. 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to speak to that man ever again.&quot; I snarled at the nurse. 
I was losing it and I could feel it. I hated losing my temper, but I 
hated it more when people, like this nurse, danced around a topic 
instead of being straight forward with me, &quot;Tell me what the hell I&#39;m 
doing here?&quot; I demanded, taking a step towards the woman. 

She raised her hands up in defence, &quot;You were admitted after breaking 
your leg.&quot; She stated frantically, &quot;You kept going on and on about some 
girl disappearing and that you are a detective so they sent you up here 
for observation.&quot; 

&quot;My friend did disappear.&quot; I shouted, appalled by the way I was being 
treated, &quot;She vanished while I was at a club. One second she was there 
and the next she had disappeared. Just like so many of the children in 
this hell hole!!&quot; I exclaimed.   

Suddenly a doctor came running down the hall with his white doctor&#39;s 
coat fluttering around him. I turned to face the man and greeted him 
with a snarl which made him stop shortly in front of me, &quot;Why hello 
Brenda. I&#39;m glad to see you are well.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not glad to see you.&quot; I hissed. He was a greying old man that 
looked innocent enough, that dissolved the moment you got the know the 
man. His face always held a long expression as if he were incapable of 
smiling. He watched me carefully through his thick rimmed black glasses 
that sat upon his fat nose. The very sight of the doctor infuriated me 
more then seeing Nurse Helder again. This man suggested to my parents 
that I should be admitted to this hospital back when I was fifteen and 
I&#39;ve despised him ever since. I was supposed to only spend a week and 
ended up staying for over a year. He kept coming up with excuses as to 
why I was not allowed to leave and seeing him again sickened me. 

&quot;I see you are the same old fireball of energy.&quot; He observed with his 
usual chuckle, a sound which I loathe intensely and still haunted me in 
my nightmares, &quot;Do you not remember why you are here?&quot; He inquired 
curiously. 

&quot;I had an accident and broke my leg.&quot; I stated coldly, &quot;Is there 
anything wrong with that?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...&quot; He opened a folder in his hands and looked over some papers, 
&quot;It says here that you claim to be a detective, is that right?&quot; He 
inquired with a raised eyebrow. He always raised that eyebrow when he 
was being cynical or talking down to people. 

I rolled my eyes in disbelief, &quot;Of course it is. After leaving here I 
made sure to never end up here again.&quot; 

&quot;What school did you attend?&quot; He quizzed. 

&quot;It was...&quot; I suddenly froze. My mind felt as if it suddenly drew a 
blank. I knew I&#39;d attended a detective school, it was not the best one, 
but it taught me the basics and allowed me to open my own business. I&#39;d 
worked so hard to gain the respect of the town&#39;s people and never look 
back at my past. So why couldn&#39;t I remember the name of the school. 

&quot;You can&#39;t remember can you?&quot; He inquired with a smirk. 

I felt a rage build up inside of me and I reached out for the man, &quot;You 
prick!&quot; I screamed out, my hand circled around the collar of his shirt, 
&quot;What have you done to me? I was living my life the way I wanted and 
then you ruined it as always. I&#39;m not insane, you are!!&quot; I screamed into 
his face like a madman. I guess at that time I really did seem insane, 
but I remember going to work everyday and reading over each of those 
cases one by one. I am not a liar. They must have done something to me. 
They must have. 

Suddenly I felt something prick me in the rear and the world started to 
become blurry. My arms weakened and I sunk into his arms like a puppet 
with its strings cut. I heard him say something, but his voice was 
gurgled and sounded as if I were hearing through water. This could not 
be happening to me again. I was finally getting somewhere in life. It 
can&#39;t be all a lie... what about Liz? Was she part of my imaginary world 
as well? The questions circled in my mind as I drifted into a deep 
sleep.
