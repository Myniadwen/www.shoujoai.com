Red eyed Dreams

In her dream Jenn felt at peace. It was as if she always belonged there 
and she never wanted to wake up. She found herself standing upon a long 
beach with the whitest of sands and long rolling cliffs off in the 
distance. A cool breeze rushed off the ocean and played with the hem of 
Jenn&#39;s skirt. She gazed out over the crystal blue water to see the sun 
setting off in the distance. Beautiful reds and purpled swirled off the 
clouds with yellows and oranges highlighting the edges, the colours 
sparked off the waves in the water as they washed up on shore. Jenn 
smiled as she scanned the beach, taking in every bit of the scenery. 
Suddenly she spotted a person laying face down on the sand not far from 
her. She quickly rushed to the person&#146;s side, ignoring the fact that her 
shoes were getting wet. As she drew closer she could see that it was a 
small girl wearing a long white summer dress and she had flowing fiery 
red hair that covered her entire back. She was drenched to the bone and 
looked as if she had recently washed up on shore. Jenn crouched down 
next to the girl and was about to touch her shoulder, to see if she was 
all right, when the girl abruptly lifted her head and stared at Jenn. 
Her fiery red eyes setting firmly upon Jenn&#146;s causing Jenn to jump and 
stumble backwards, falling into the water, the same eyes she saw in the 
window that very morning.


                            ********
                                
The sound of the school bell ringing startled Jenn from her dreams. 
Stretching she gazed up at the clock. It was already lunch hour; she had 
missed her second period class completely, but could not really 
careless. She&#39;d just have to make up the schoolwork after school. She 
cracked her neck and let out a yawn, then leaning over to grab her shoes 
to find them slightly damp and small amounts of sand in the heel. She 
turned her shoe over in her hand, letting the sand pore into her hand, 
as she recalled the dream she just had. It was nothing like her other 
dreams, it was almost real and the presence of the sand only reassured 
her that it was in deed real. She shook her head trying to clear it; 
nevertheless she could not shake those eyes from her mind, those ruby 
red irises. They were filled with so much sorrow and pain that Jenn 
wanted to reach out to the girl and hold her. Jenn wondered if it was 
someone she met in the past. Certainly she would never have forgotten 
such a beautiful face, so she dismissed the idea. Hearing girls filling 
the halls, Jenn quickly jumped into her shoes, ignoring the slightly 
soggy feeling and joined the stream of bodies. Before long she found her 
sneakers had dried and herself at her homeroom door, which she knocked 
lightly upon door before entering.

&quot;Come in!&quot; Mr. Johnson called out from his desk and gave her his 
trademarked warm smile upon seeing Jenn standing at the door, &quot;I&#39;m glad 
to see you. How are you feeling?&quot; He asked anxiously. 

&quot;Alright, I guess.&quot; Jenn shuffled in place. She just wanted to get her 
schoolbag and get out of there as quickly as possible, not wanting a 
repeat of the incident from earlier. 

&quot;You looking for this?&quot; Mr. Johnson inquired, pulling her bag out from 
behind his desk and picking up her books from his desk with his other 
hand, &quot;I thought it would be safer here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Jenn shyly crossed the room and took the bag and books from 
the man. Her eyes fell upon the book she had been reading and she 
quickly flipped through it in search for any sign of the blood from 
earlier. Not finding any she dropped the items into the bag and prepared 
to leave.

The teacher watch her carefully as he leaned back in his chair, &quot;You 
know, I was expecting it to be a lot heavier.&#148; He chuckled, &#147;I thought 
there was a laptop in there.&quot; He said pointing at the bag.

&quot;It was my mom&#39;s.&quot; Jenn admitted, clenching the bag close to her chest, 
&quot;She let me have it when she got a newer one.&quot; 

The teacher&#39;s face grew long, &quot;How long has it been since you last saw 
your mother?&quot; He questioned, concerned for his student. 

&quot;I... I can&#39;t remember.&quot; Jenn started uneasily. She didn&#39;t like talking 
about her mother. It always made her realize just how much she missed 
her, &quot;I . . . &quot; Her lip quivered and she started to tremble, &quot;I have to 
go . . . &quot; Jenn rapidly backed away and turned towards the door. 

&quot;You know you can talk to me anytime.&quot; The teacher called out to Jenn&#146;s 
back, &quot;That is if you need someone to talk to.&quot; 

Jenn lowered her head and took a deep breath, &quot;No, that&#39;s alright.&quot; She 
murmured before disappearing out of the class. 

Jenn slipped through the crowds, weaving her way to her locker. She 
reached into her school bag when a ball of paper hit her in the head and 
rolled to the floor. She scanned the crowd to see who threw the paper, 
but there were too many girls around. She slowly picked up the paper and 
unravelled it to discover someone had childishly written the word &quot;DYKE&quot; 
in large letters with a marker. Jenn smirked at the paper; she found it 
amusing how people liked to state the obvious and actually thought 
calling her a dyke would bother her. She crumpled the paper back into a 
ball and tossed it at a nearby garbage pail only to have it snatched out 
of the air by a long slender hand.

&quot;And what do we have here?&quot; Kris inquired curiously, opening the ball 
and reading the note, then peering over the top of the paper with a 
raised eyebrow, &quot;Is this true?&quot; She prodded with a knowing grin. 

&quot;Nope, it is all lies I tell you.&quot; Jenn replied, trying hard not to 
laugh while fiddling with the combination lock on her locker.

&quot;Lies you say?&quot; Kris leaned against the locker next to Jenn, &quot;You so 
sure? It would be a shame because you are quite a good-looking little 
girl.&quot; 

Jenn pulled the lock off and glanced at Kris, &quot;Why, Kris Tallet, if I 
didn&#39;t know you as well as I did I would think that you&#39;re coming onto 
me.&quot; Jenn spoke with the best fake southern accent she could muster 
without breaking into laughter. 

&quot;Depends on what you want.&quot; Kris set her eyes upon Jenn&#39;s. Such deep 
blue eyes that Jenn felt like they would engulf her.

&quot;Uhhhh . . . &quot; Jenn stammered, staring into those eyes Jenn could feel 
herself flush. Kris had a way of looking at girls that made it difficult 
to turn away at times and Jenn was never sure if Kris was serious or 
just playing around. One could never be sure when it came to this girl. 

Kris was the first to turn away and stared up at the ceiling, &quot;I hear 
from May that you weren&#39;t feeling too well this morning.&quot; There was a 
concerned look upon her face and a serious tone to her words.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jenn turned back to her locker. She could still feel her 
heart-beating deep inside of herself. She sometimes wished Kris would 
stop playing around and at the same time was terrified of the idea, 
&quot;I...  I just needed a small nap. Nothing to worry about.&quot; Jenn half 
lied as she opened her locker and two small envelops fell to the ground. 
Kris quickly scooped the letters up before Jenn could process what had 
fallen in the first place. 

&quot;Now what do we have here?&quot; Kris wondered with a mischievous grin while 
turning the letters over in her hand. Each letter had &#147;Jennifer North&#148; 
name written on them in neat feminine handwriting and Kris placed the 
letters under her nose to take whiff of them, &quot;I smell new love in the 
air.&quot; She teased. 

&quot;Give me those!&quot; Jenn demanded as she snatched the letters out of her 
friend&#39;s hands. She could not help to sniff at the letters to see what 
Kris was talking about, but could only smell paper and glue. She felt 
another wave of heat when she noticed Kris beaming at her and quickly 
dropped the letters into her schoolbag, to be opened later. Other than 
herself, Kris was the only other girl that was treated more like a boy 
around the school. Over the year the two of them would challenge each 
other to see who could get the most love letters and gifts. Jenn 
nervously pulled out a couple of textbooks from the bag, attempting to 
not let her eyes drift back to Kris, and dropped them to the bottom of 
the locker.

&quot;You know you are really cute when you blush.&quot; Kris reached out and 
gently brushed Jenn&#146;s hair over her ear and gazed into the girl&#146;s eyes, 
and then abruptly pulled back and pushed off of the lockers, &quot;We should 
really get going. The others will be waiting.&quot; She stated as she started 
to walk down the hall. 

&quot;Right!&quot; Jenn closed her locker and locked it before running after Kris. 
As she fell into step beside her friend she glanced up at the girl and 
wished that she knew what was going on in her mind, she wouldn&#39;t mind 
understanding girls in general for that matter. It always amazed Jenn 
how mature Kris appeared to be for a seventeen-year-old. Most of the 
other teens were still flustered about who they were and where they were 
going, however Kris always held a quality to her that makes it seem as 
if she knew exactly what she was doing no matter what it was. For 
instance at this moment she walked with a long stride and her hands held 
her wrists behind her back in a casual manner, while between the fingers 
of one hand she held the top edge of a brown paper bag. Not a care in 
the world could be seen upon the girl&#146;s face and Jenn wasn&#39;t sure if 
Kris was just a good actor or just wise for her years, but for some 
reason the calm demeanour of her friend always made her feel better, 
even if she was a big flirt.

The two girls stopped at a door with a small sign hanging beside it, 
which read &quot;Club Hen.&quot;  Jenn opened the door and entered the room. The 
teachers allowed them to use this room all they wished, as long as they 
didn&#146;t do anything that went against school regulations, so some of the 
girls had brought in a few pieces of furniture for the club. A small 
couch rested against one of the far walls, on which two girls quickly 
sat up from their curled up position and relaxed when noticing the new 
arrivals were not teachers. Two recliners were set to either side of the 
couch next to the far windows with two large bookcases, filled with many 
books that had been donated to the club, taking up the far corners. A 
long table was set in the middle where several girls already sat, eating 
lunch. The girls exchanged greeting as they walked across the room and 
found seats at the table. May looked up from her lunch with a smile that 
disappeared the moment she saw the ragged look upon Jenn&#146;s face. 

Tanya jumped up from her spot on a recliner near the window, &quot;How you 
feeling, Jenn?&quot; She inquired worriedly, perching upon the arm of the 
chair, eagerly awaiting her friend&#146;s answer. 

&quot;I have a slight headache, but nothing more.&quot; Jenn explained pulling out 
a tuna fish sandwich from the brown paper bag that held her lunch. 

&quot;Did you get some rest?&quot; May pried, more anxious then she was before. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, May.&quot; Jenn countered, taking a deep breath, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
snapped at you earlier. I just... &quot;

&quot;No no, I ... I&#39;m sorry I got in the way.&quot; May stammered apprehensively, 
&quot;I...  was just worried about you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Jenn repeated attempting to swallow back the irritation 
she felt from the battery of questions and good wishes. 

&quot;Is it your time?&quot; Tanya remarked bluntly.

&quot;No! It&#39;s not!&quot; Jenn screamed, finally fed up with the interrogation. 
She hated it when people brought up her period every time she was 
irritable. &quot;I&#39;m just having a day, alright?&quot; The room filled with an 
unsettling quiet that could be felt. It was unusual to see Jenn get 
annoyed by anything like this, and nobody really wanted to upset their 
dear prince, so they kept quiet for the duration of the lunch hour. 

Jenn ate her lunch quietly then moved to her favourite reclining chair. 
She curled up on her side and stared out the window as that feeling 
began to build up inside of her yet again. It felt as if something was 
twisting deep in the pit of her stomach like a nagging feeling that she 
couldn&#39;t really put her finger on. She didn&#39;t know how long she stared 
out that window watching the autumn leaves playing tag with the wind 
before she drifted off to sleep once again. 

                              ****

Once more, Jenn found herself on the beach watching the setting sun. The 
red headed girl washed up on shore and again Jenn approached her. Jenn 
knelt down and reached out towards the girl, just as her fingers touched 
the girl&#146;s shoulder her mind rushed with a flood of images. Visions of 
blood and dark creatures invaded her mind along with a mixture of pain, 
torment and anguish that threatened to tear Jenn&#146;s mind apart, causing 
her to reel backwards and stagger into the ocean waves. Suddenly she was 
knocked off her feet by a wave and icy cold ocean water rushed around 
her body, pulling her into its deep dark depths. She could feel her 
lungs fill with salty ocean water as she struggled for breath, death&#146;s 
grip firmly around her throat. 

                            *****  

&quot;Jenn!&quot; Kris&#39;s voice called out to Jenn in her sleep, &quot;Jennifer.&quot; She 
called out to her again. It took Jenn a moment to realize that the voice 
was not coming from within the dream itself. &quot;KRIS!!!&quot; Jenn sat bolt 
right up in the recliner to find herself in her friend&#146;s arms. She 
coughed and struggled to catch her breath. She could still feel the icy 
cold fingers of death&#146;s hands around her neck, slowly loosening their 
grip, and the taste of salt in her mouth. 

&quot;Shhhh...&quot; Kris whispered softly into the girl&#39;s ear, &quot;It is just me. 
You have nothing to be afraid of, everyone else has already left.&quot; 

&quot;Kris . . . It&#146;s really you . . . &quot; Jenn stuttered, trying to catch her 
breath. She felt like something had reached into her heart and tried to 
crush it. Bewildered her eyes darted around the room in search of 
something familiar, but everything had a strange feeling to it and she 
could feel a pressure building up behind her eyes. Frightfully she 
clenched at Kris&#39;s arm, &quot;Kris, I&#39;m scared.&quot; She stated shakily. 

&quot;You were having another nightmare, weren&#39;t you?&quot; Kris inquired softly, 
making sure to keep her voice low so she didn&#39;t scare the girl anymore. 

&quot;It was horrible.&quot; The image of the red head flickered before Jenn&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;I can still see her.&quot; Jenn&#39;s whole body shook violently and she 
started coughing again, tasting salt water and sand upon her lips, 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with me?&quot; She asked between coughs. 

&quot;Nothing is wrong with you.&quot; Kris stroked the girl&#39;s hair, &quot;When do you 
have to see that doctor?&quot; 

Jenn was visibly terrified, &quot;At five o&#146;clock, but I don&#39;t want to go.&quot; 
She replied, clinging to the girl&#146;s shirtsleeve.

&quot;Would you like me to come with you?&quot; Kris suggested, setting her 
forehead lightly on Jenn&#39;s. 

Jenn hugged the girl tighter, &quot;Please, but I don&#39;t think I can make it 
through the rest of class.&quot; She felt a comfort in the warm flesh of 
Kris&#146;s head against her own. 

&quot;That is alright.&#148; Kris soothed, &#147;I&#39;ll just tell the teachers you are 
not feeling well and we&#39;ll skip the afternoon classes.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&#148; Jenn set her head on Kris&#39;s shoulder. &#147;I don&#39;t know what 
I&#39;d do without you.&quot;

Kris let out a soft sigh and for the first time she held her friend 
securely. With Jenn&#146;s head resting lightly upon her shoulder, Jenn felt 
a familiar solace in her friend&#39;s embrace. There was something about 
being in Kris&#39;s arms that made Jenn feel at home. She looked up to see 
that Kris had her eyes lightly closed and Jenn could feel her own heart 
pounding heavily in her chest as an urge to kiss the girl building up 
inside of her and she found herself unable to tear her eyes away from 
the girl&#146;s soft pink lips, but something deep in her heart knew that 
they could never be. Jenn suddenly lifted her head and shook the idea of 
a kissing from her mind, causing Kris to open her eyes. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Kris asked quietly. 

Jenn simply nodded. She didn&#39;t trust her own voice, afraid that if she 
did speak that she might cry. Something inside Jenn told her to run, 
told her that if she spoke her feelings out loud that everything would 
crumble and fall apart, like some kind of forgotten dream. 

&quot;Let us get going, okay?&quot; Kris urged as she stood up from her spot on 
the arm of the chair. 

Jenn quickly followed closely behind her friend with her head down, not 
wanting Kris to see the pain that was building up in her eyes. 

At the office Kris explained everything to the principal, who was very 
understanding and let the two girls leave without question. Now with the 
afternoon free, they left the school in search of a way to kill a few 
hours. Their homes were out of the question and they couldn&#39;t go to the 
mall in their uniforms, since security would cause a fuss. It was 
finally decided that they would spend the rest of the afternoon watching 
the day pass by in one of the local parks. 

They found a park not far from Jenn&#39;s doctor&#39;s appointment and sat upon 
one of the many long wooden benches with their curved black iron legs. 
Kris leaned back with her head hanging over the back of the bench and 
stared up at the clouds in the sky while Jenn tried hard to watch the 
squirrels playing with the autumn leaves. They sat like that for some 
time, not saying so much as a word. Just enjoying the cool breeze that 
would swoop by from time to time, curious about the two girls, and cause 
some of the leave to dance around their feet.

&quot;Kris?&quot; Jenn inquired after a little while. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; Kris answered, not moving.

Jenn glanced at Kris, trying to search for the words that were stirring 
so deeply inside her. She remembered the comfortable feeling of Kris&#39;s 
embrace and swallowed hard, turning her eyes to the ground, &quot;Have you . 
. . ever been . . . in love?&quot; She explored.

Kris sat silent for a moment as if she pondered the questions 
profoundly, &quot;Once.&quot; She finally informed with a sigh, then leaned 
forwards in her seat, with her elbows upon her knees and looked out at a 
couple of birds searching for food. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Jenn sat up and observed Kris closely, &quot;I don&#39;t mean to 
pry.&quot; 

&quot;No worries.&quot; Kris continued to watch the birds while letting her mind 
drift through memories from long ago, &quot;We sort of drifted apart.&quot; She 
answered in nearly a whisper.

&quot;Drifted apart?&quot; Jenn was confused, &quot;Didn&#39;t she really love you?&quot;

Kris closed her eyes and took a deep breath, &quot;We loved each other more 
then anything on this earth.&quot; 

&quot;Then what happened?&quot; Jennifer felt both excitement and frustrated. Kris 
was not known to talk much about her past so Jenn was all ears to learn 
more about her friend, however the idea that Kris just left her love for 
no reason bothered Jenn to no end.

Kris took a deep breath, &quot;She was in an accident.&quot; She explained closing 
her eyes, trying to keep her emotions in check, &quot;Afterwards she could 
not remember anything.&quot; 

&quot;Amnesia?&quot; 

&quot;Something like that.&quot; Kris leaned back on the bench again and wrapped 
an arm over her eyes, &quot;After a while she gained a new life without me.&quot; 
She spoke with a tremble in her voice, &quot;There is nothing worse than 
watching the one you love drift away from you.&quot; She whispered merely 
audibly. 

&quot;Oh, Kris . . . &quot; Jenn tried hard to understand her friends feeling, &quot;I 
. . . I didn&#39;t know.&quot; 

&quot;It is okay.&quot; Kris wiped at her eyes, &quot;She has her life now and I have 
mine.&quot; 

Gently, Jenn reached out and touched Kris on the shoulder, &quot;You still 
love her, don&#39;t you?&quot; When Kris&#39;s eyes fell on Jenn there was a great 
depth of pain in them like nothing Jenn had ever seen before. She 
couldn&#39;t even imagine the amount of torment her friend must be in. Yet 
now she was starting to understand why Kris pulls away when the two of 
them got too close, &quot;Kris, you know I&#39;m here for you if you need me.&quot; 
Jenn soothed softly. 

&quot;I...&quot; A tear formed in the corner of Kris&#39;s eye, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She stood 
up and wiped the tear away with the back of her hand, &quot;We should 
probably get going to that doctors of yours.&quot; Without waiting she 
started down the path out of the park.

Jenn glanced at her watch, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right.&quot; She stood and ran to 
catch up with her friend.
