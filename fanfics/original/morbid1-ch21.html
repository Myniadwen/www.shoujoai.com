<a href="../original/morbid1-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>And then there was...

Maria slowly opened her eyes to gaze up at a star filled sky. Was it 
really over? She sat up to find Anita and Amanda laying up the gazebo 
floor, &quot;Amanda!?!&quot; She crawled over to her friend&#39;s side and rolled the 
girl over. She did not make any sound or show any signs of movement. 

&quot;A... man... da...?&quot; Anita set her hand upon the girl&#39;s as Maria placed 
the girl&#39;s head upon her lap and they softly wept for their friend. 

Elizabeth began to stir from her spot in the grass. She rubbed her head 
and scanned her surroundings, &quot;What happened? How did I get out here?&quot; 
She stood up to see the two crying over her friend&#39;s body, &quot;Are you 
alright Miss?&quot; She inquired gently. 

&quot;She is gone.&quot; Maria sobbed, &quot;I knew we should not have done this and 
now...&quot; 

Anita let out a heavy wail and throw herself upon Amanda, &quot;Please do not 
leave me.&quot; She sobbed into Amanda&#39;s chest, &quot;You said that I was yours. I 
was going to take care of you.&quot; 

&quot;Maria?&quot; A small voice called out from over the side of the gazebo. 

Maria moved away from Amanda&#39;s body to look over the edge, &quot;JAMIE!!!&quot; 
She found the teddy bear lying in a small bush and picked it up, &quot;You 
are still alive?&quot; She inquired bewildered by what she was seeing. 

&quot;Sort of.&quot; Jamie coughed. &quot;Did we win?&quot;

&quot;I... guess...&quot; Maria said dismally, &quot;But Amanda... she...&quot; She could 
not bring herself to saying it.

&quot;It is too late.&quot; Elizabeth tried to sooth Anita; &quot;She is in a better 
place now.&quot; 

&quot;She cannot die!!&quot; Anita wailed, &quot;She promised I would be her first.&quot; 

&quot;And you will.&quot; Amanda sat up and smiled at Anita, &quot;I think I hit my 
head.&quot; She grumbled rubbing the back of her head. 

&quot;LADY AMANDA!!!&quot; Anita threw herself into Amanda&#39;s arms once again, 
giving her a tight embrace. Maria rushed to the girl&#39;s side and joined 
in the hug with Jamie in the middle.

&quot;Help!!!&quot; Jamie struggled, &quot;Pain...&quot; 

&quot;Oh!&quot; Maria broke the hug to have Jamie collapse in her arms, &quot;Are you 
alright, Jamie?&quot;

&quot;I feel like I have bruises everywhere.&quot; Jamie muttered through a veil 
of pain. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Amanda inquired glancing around the gazebo. 

&quot;Jamie&#39;s body sacrificed itself.&quot; Jacob stated as he approached the 
group, &quot;Her heart was not clouded by her mind so it did what it felt was 
right.&quot; 

&quot;A Werewolf!!!&quot; Elizabeth screamed and crawled to the far end of the 
gazebo. 

&quot;Beth, calm down.&quot; Jamie soothed, &quot;This is Jacob, he is a friend.&quot; 

&quot;Jamie?!?&quot; Elizabeth stared at the bear, &quot;Is that really you?&quot; 

&quot;Ummm... yeah...&quot; Jamie stated, slightly embarrassed. 

&quot;So what happened to Jamie&#39;s body?&quot; Amanda inquired curiously. 

&quot;Give it a moment.&quot; Jacob stated with a grin, &quot;And you may want to move 
out of the way.&quot; 

The air started to crackle with energy and the girls scrambled behind 
the werewolf. A swirling portal of light appeared before them and 
Jamie&#39;s body stepped out onto the gazebo, dressed in tight black leather 
pants, a white tank and leather jacket. There were also several 
colourful beaded necklaces around its neck. The corpse gave the girl&#39;s a 
quick thumbs up.  

Jacob let out a bellowing laugh that startled the girls. &quot;Well ladies it 
has been a pleasure, but I think it is time to go.&quot; 

&quot;That it is my friend.&quot; Morbius stated from behind them. The girls 
turned around to the ringmaster standing before them with Victoria at 
his side, all the other circus performers had gathered in the park 
behind him. Morbius turned to Victoria, &quot;Thank you for your hospitality 
my lady.&quot; He kissed the woman lightly on the hand, &quot;I hope you do not 
mind Markus staying with you? He has been searching for his muse and 
seems to have found it here in this tiny town.&quot; 

Victoria blushed, &quot;That is quiet alright. I guess I will get used to him 
over time.&quot; 

&quot;You will become accustom to him.&quot; Jacob said with a laugh, &quot;And I see 
you having a lot of help along the way.&quot; 

&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Maria inquired giving the werewolf a curious 
look. 

&quot;You will find many strangers visiting your town in the future.&quot; Jacob 
explained, &quot;Be nice to them. You never know you might meet a good 
friend.&quot; He patted the girl on the head, &quot;Well Good-bye everyone.&quot; Jacob 
stepped through the portal. 

&quot;Be well, my friends.&quot; Morbius bid the girls farewell, &quot;Oh and could one 
of you give this letter to a Mr. Victor Burnwell?&quot; He handed a small 
brown envelop to Anita, &quot;I do think he lives up in the Holland manor.&quot; 
He chuckled gleefully then leapt into the portal. One after another the 
performers bid their farewells and left until all that remained was the 
group of women. 

Victoria turned to the teddy bear in Maria&#39;s arms, &quot;So.. Ummm... Jamie, 
will you be returning to The Raven&#39;s Keep?&quot; She nervously inquired, 
&quot;There is still a room for you if you want it.&quot; 

Jamie glanced up at Maria, who hugged her tightly, &quot;I have been offered 
to stay at the Greystoke Castle and I think that is where I belong.&quot; 

&quot;I am happy for you.&quot; Victoria declared and went to hug the girl only to 
stop.

&quot;Here.&quot; Maria handed Jamie over to Victoria who took her in her arms 
gratefully. 

&quot;You will return from time to time won&#39;t you?&quot; Victoria inquired 
dismally. 

&quot;She better.&quot; Elizabeth demanded, &quot;If not I will march up to that castle 
and drag her furry butt down for a visit.&quot; She stated with a grin, &quot;Both 
of you.&quot; She pointed from the teddy to Jamie&#39;s body. 

&quot;Alright I promise I will return.&quot; Jamie pledged. 

&quot;Good.&quot; Victoria passed Jamie back to Maria, trying hard to hide her 
sorrow, &quot;And you are free to come by too, my lady.&quot; She said with a 
curtsy, &quot;All of you.&quot; She smiled at Amanda and Anita who were hugging 
each other off to the side. 

&quot;If you provide the tea then how about three o&#39;clock today?&quot; Maria 
stated with a grin. 

&quot;I will make sure to have the place ready for you.&quot; Victoria agreed, 
&quot;Come on Elizabeth.&quot; The two women started down the gazebo stair, &quot;I 
want to introduce you to our new musician, Markus.&quot; 

&quot;Shall we head home too?&quot; Maria inquired of the girls.

&quot;Please.&quot; Jamie pleaded, &quot;I wonder if your mother has something to stop 
pain.&quot; 

&quot;I think she does, Lady Jamie.&quot; Anita replied.

Maria stopped to see Amanda still standing at the gazebo, &quot;You coming 
Amanda?&quot; Maria asked her friend.

&quot;What do we do about this?&quot; Amanda pointed at the glowing portal in the 
centre of the gazebo.
