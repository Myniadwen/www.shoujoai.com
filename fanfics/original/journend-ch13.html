<h1>Journey's End (part 13 of 14)</h1>

<a href="../original/journend-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>The car bumped through the potholes up the drive, the
little car pulling in front of the beautiful Victorian
style house on the edge of the sea. Salt tinged the
air as the redhead got out of her car, sunlight
tinting her skin and hair as she gazed up at the house
that had over the past few months become her home.
Popping the trunk she collected her bags and slammed
it shut, walking up to the house and unlocking the
door with a smile. After being out on an interview
tour for nearly a week and a half, Nicole Richards was
glad to be back.

Nicole put her bag down with a sigh in the front hall
of Journey&#39;s End, puffing out a happy sigh. &quot;I&#39;m
home,&quot; the redhead called out, smiling.

&quot;I know,&quot; the amused voice came from right behind her.

The tired looking Nicole jumped, quickly turning to
meet the gentle smile of her lover who was standing
there right behind her. &quot;You just love doing that to
me,&quot; she chuckled fondly, gazing adoringly at the
lovely blonde. &#39;God she&#39;s just adorable,&#39; she
admitted, &#39;even when she&#39;s pulling ghostly stuff like
this.&#39;

&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; Laura promptly agreed, her eyes twinkling
with pure amusement. Her ghostly body seemed to firm
up for a moment as she leaned forward, pressing cool
lips to Nicole&#39;s cheek, &quot;Welcome home.&quot;

&quot;You have no idea how happy I am to be back,&quot; Nicole
murmured to Laura honestly. She picked up her bags as
they walked along the hallway towards the living room
and stairs then she quietly confessed, &quot;I missed you.&quot;

Laura smiled shyly, the old fashioned dress that she
wore ruffled by a unfelt breeze, swirling away then
seeming to thin out into a swirling mist. &quot;I thought
you&#39;d be happy to be away from me for awhile,&quot; she
looked over at Nicole with a gentle gaze, &quot;I know I
can crowd you at times.&quot;

&quot;Even after the first day I missed you,&quot; Nicole
answered Laura frankly as they went up to the master
bedroom, &quot;and it only got worse over time.&quot; She
casually thumped the door open with her hip as she
continued, &quot;More than just becoming part of my life,
you&#39;re in my heart.&quot;

&quot;And you mine,&quot; a faintly blushing Laura agreed
softly, smiling as Nicole set her bag down. She
sighed, &quot;I wish I could leave this place, go with
you.....&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Nicole said quietly. She smiled,
&quot;Having you here at the end of the trip almost makes
all the fuss bearable.&quot;

&quot;Was it really so bad?&quot; Laura asked her as she
gracefully settled on the edge of the bed and eagerly
watched Nicole unpack. The other woman unpacked far
less neatly than when she had gotten ready to go,
simply yanking items of clothing out and then stuffing
the stuff into the dirty clothes hamper or the
dressers, as needed.

Nicole dumped the empty suitcase to the floor with a
sigh then she sat down beside Laura. &quot;Most of my book
appearances are about the work I do,&quot; she explained
tiredly, &quot;this time, it was all about me and my life.
It was all just a bit odd.&quot;

Laura and Nicole sat close together, the author
obviously unbothered by either Laura&#39;s unearthly aura
or the slightly chill mist of her physical form.
Laura&#39;s ghostly touch was soothing, her shimmering
form stroking the side of Nicole&#39;s face as she
murmured, &quot;Well, I can understand people being
fascinated with you.&quot;

Nicole smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;m not that interesting.&quot;

&quot;You are to me,&quot; was Laura&#39;s quiet reply.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nicole blushed faintly. She studied Laura
a moment, relaxing as she looked over at the woman who
was sitting beside her, &quot;You know, Rachel and I got to
talking when she drove me over to the airport.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Laura asked mildly.

She was keeping her voice quite deliberately neutral
and Nicole had to fight hard to hold back a smile. It
was clear that Laura wasn&#39;t terribly enamored to
Rachel, especially considering Nicole&#39;s past with the
woman. &quot;She asked me about you,&quot; Nicole confided, &quot;and
I told her something about you that I should have told
you a long time ago.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Laura asked, her hair shifting gently,
stirred as much by her nervous feelings as by any hint
of a breeze.

Nicole hesitated, then steeled her courage as she
continued, &quot;I love you.&quot;

Laura met Nicole&#39;s eyes, her smile hesitant as she
asked softly, &quot;Are you sure? I&#39;m not....&quot;

Nicole let her hand touch the almost immaterial cheek,
gently cupping ghostly flesh as she smiled
reassuringly. &quot;I&#39;ve never been as sure of anything in
my while life,&quot; she answered Laura with complete
honestly.

The phantom memory of tears glistened on Laura&#39;s
cheeks as she smiled happily. &quot;I love you too,&quot; she
agreed. Her form solidified, her body becoming opaque
as she pressed her body to Nicole&#39;s, knocking her
backwards onto the bed.

&quot;Woah,&quot; Nicole gasped startled as Laura kissed her
fiercely.

Laura&#39;s eyes were cloudy with desire as she looked
down at Nicole, her touch tender on the other woman&#39;s
cheek. &quot;I missed you as well,&quot; she murmured, her
clothes having disappeared somewhere along the way,
&quot;would you like to see how much?&quot;

Nicole found herself feeling somewhat breathless at
the totally unexpected aggression that Laura was
showing to her. &#39;Breathless and a bit excited,&#39; she
silently admitted. She grinned back at Laura as she
said, &quot;Oh yes.&quot;

Laura kissed the base of Nicole&#39;s neck, her slightly
chill lips making Nicole&#39;s fevered blood race. &quot;Most
of the time you were gone,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I was
reading some of the books you brought here.&quot; A wicked
smile, &quot;I learned a great deal, I think.&quot;

Nicole chuckled then moaned as Laura began to pull
open the white button up shirt that she had worn,
kissing cloth covered breasts. &quot;From what I remember
from last time you don&#39;t need any lessons,&quot; she said
breathlessly.

&quot;You are a real gentleman,&quot; Laura purred as she undid
the front clasping bra. She licked gently, enjoying
the gasps that her tongue brought forth then
continued, &quot;But I promised myself to make your
homecoming special.&quot;

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Nicole gasped out a soft sound of surprise as
Laura stopped her careful exploration of her breasts
and slid down to kiss her bare belly. &quot;It already is,&quot;
she managed as her lover smoothly undid her pants.

Laura laughed softly but warmly as she continued, &quot;You
haven&#39;t see anything yet.&quot;

In the morning sun Nicole drank her coffee, jerked out
of a few months of memories by a gentle hand resting
on her arm. Laura smiled, the noble lady looking so
different from the wild woman who had all but ravaged
her last night, and asked, &quot;What are you thinking
about?&quot;

Nicole returned her gaze, a faint blush touching her
cheeks. &quot;Just how lucky I am to have come here and met
you,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;I&#39;m the lucky one,&quot; Laura said with a smile. She
hesitated, looking into Nicole&#39; eyes searchingly as
she continued, &quot;I&#39;ve asked this before, but are you
sure? Staying here with a ghost isn&#39;t going to be
easy....&quot;

There was a twinkle in Nicole&#39;s eyes as she murmured,
&quot;The surest sign that someone cares about someone else
is putting their needs before your own.&quot; Laura
actually blushed as Nicole continued, &quot;Someday I&#39;m
going to grow old, love, while you&#39;re staying
beautiful forever.&quot; A pause, &quot;I don&#39;t want to imagine
ever being a burden to you, either.&quot;

&quot;You are beautiful,&quot; Laura said intensely, &quot;and always
will be.&quot;

Nicole blinked back tears, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; She giggled
oddly, &quot;I guess we&#39;ll be having this conversation ever
little while, huh?&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Laura conceded with a answering chuckle. More
seriously she continued, &quot;I love you, and I think I
always will.&quot;

&quot;And I you,&quot; Nicole answered, carefully leaning
forward to kiss that ghostly cheek.

Epilogue:

And life went on in the home called Journey&#39;s End and
the world beyond. Nicole&#39;s romance novels actually
grew in popularity with her notoriety, and her first
lesbian novel was quite successful. The town soon came
to regard Nicole as an eccentric but still one of
their own, and she began to establish friendships
there.

The romance between Laura and Nicole simply grew
stronger as the years passed, and though Nicole&#39;s
writing would take her away for times, she would
always return. The ghost of Journey&#39;s End was still
sighed often by visitors, but the frightening aura
scared most people away. Still, the two were content
with each other

In her late eighties Nicole passed away up at
Journey&#39;s End, surrounded by friends both new and old.
Her will set up the house as a writer&#39;s retreat and
museum, restored to the look it once had back in the
early 1900s. The guests would comment on the warmth,
how safe they felt staying there, and would relate the
most unusual stories.

In various rooms of the house two figures would be
seen, a blonde and a redhead, each blowing with youth
and happiness. The ghosts often were seen in the
woods, gazing at the sunrise, or playing in the house,
and all would feel their pure joy.

End.

Author&#39;s Notes: The first episode began in the
present, then flashing back to Nicole&#39;s arrival in
Journey&#39;s End and this final episode returns to that
present. While I was tempted to continue on past this
point, covering more of the issues around Nicole&#39;s
coming out, I thought this would be a good place to
bring it to an end. I want to thank everyone who&#39;s
read so far, and I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed this.</pre>
