~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

In that second, Minako threw her bowl of gyuu-don into the air with one 
powerful thrust. She then rushed forwards straight for Thug #1. She 
landed a searing blow to that horny teen&#39;s pasty cheek which sent him 
flying backwards from her. Then she ran into the guy that was still 
holding Yuki Inoue by the collar. Her lithe body rotated once and then 
she extended her leg, ramming into the stomach of Thug #3 with great 
power but no effort. He was floored in that instant, doubling over with 
pain, gripping his abdomen tenderly. The bowl of gyuu-don came back down 
to earth seconds later. Minako stuck her hand out and it fell into her 
palm. Easy as cake. While Yuki took this second to adjust to her 
newfound safety, Minako took the chopsticks out of the bowl and began 
eating once more.

Yuki soon bowed in thanks to her. &quot;...T-Thank you so much, Miss Endou.&quot;

&quot;Ah, no need,&quot; Minako said ceasing breakfast for just one second, &quot;Those 
idiots from the Hitou Koku Mi are always hassling the girls around here 
for action. They&#39;ll learn that it gets them nowhere, soon enough. So 
what was your name again?&quot;

&quot;My name?&quot; Yuki responded, &quot;My name is Yuki Inoue. I&#39;m a new student at 
Soryuusuke Gakuen and I&#39;m running sort of late. So I took a shortcut 
through Ueda Park and I ended up running into those boys.&quot;

Minako nodded in understand. &quot;I get you. But a word of advice? Never go 
into Ueda Park alone. Especially at night. It&#39;s where a lot of fighting 
takes place and I can tell that you&#39;re the kind of girl that likes 
things peaceful, right?&quot;

Yuki nodded again, her long locks of snowy hair lulling with her. &quot;Yes. 
I&#39;m not... very fond of violence.&quot;

&quot;Well in any case, you&#39;re going to need a friend if you&#39;re going to 
tangle with Soryuusuke Gakuen. So I might as well take up the job. 
You&#39;ll be needing someone to help you find your way around too, right?&quot;

The white-haired Yuki smiled sweetly at her. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Not that Minako really needed any thanks. She was more than happy to do 
it. And the two young women, Minako Endou and Yuki Inoue, finally met 
with each other. They quickly passed by the downed thugs of Hitou Koku 
Mi, and then continued the journey to school. And eventually they got 
there. To the imposing, tall, but some how romantic seeming halls and 
walls of Soryuusuke Gakuen. The school bell was close to ringing. Most 
people had already entered to get to class. As Minako and Yuki came up 
to the black-painted gates, they planned to follow suit. Until...

Minako pointed to the towering pillar of education. &quot;And there it is.&quot;

But a third voice made itself known. &quot;Minako!&quot;

The Endou girl knew that voice well. She slipped her eyes shut and 
sighed, while Yuki looked over to where the voice had come from. At the 
side of the gates, standing before a long, long, long, LONG, stretch 
limo, stood a girl. But not just any girl. A beautiful and magnificent 
woman of youthful, calculating intelligence and a villainous cunning 
that outshined even the very flames of hell. With one jerk of the head 
she tossed that lengthy ponytail of raven black hair over her shoulder 
and gave a confident smile in Minako&#39;s direction. 

But Minako couldn&#39;t seem to replicate the smile. &quot;...Oh man... Onimi... 
I thought I could sneak into school to avoid her again but saving Yuki 
must have caught up on me.&quot;

The powerful and beautiful young woman known as Onimi Izakumuji, slammed 
the door shut to her long, long, long, long, LONG stretch limo. The 
chauffer at the wheel of the vehicle nodded to her and slowly pulled out 
into drive, leaving Onimi behind. The dark-haired girl ran her thin 
fingers through her heavy bangs and tossed her ponytail over her other 
shoulder. She (with her book bag in hand)  sauntered straight over to 
Minako, past a silent Yuki, with hardly a word to say. That is, until, 
Onimi threw herself all over Minako. The Endou girl heaved a deep sigh 
as she was wrapped up in Onimi&#39;s controlling embrace. Something that had 
grown into somewhat of a routine.

&quot;Oh, Minako!&quot; Onimi said with a deep pining in her voice, &quot;I haven&#39;t 
seen you at all since last Wednesday! I was looking for you everywhere 
during the weekend yet I still could not find you! You wouldn&#39;t happen 
to be avoiding me, would you?&quot;

&quot;Well, actually...&quot;

&quot;Great! I knew that was not the case,&quot; Onimi&#39;s smile grew even more 
devious, &quot;As a proud member of the Izakumuji Family, I have to possess 
everything of worth. The best that anyone could hope for... therefore 
you belong to me, do you not?&quot;

Minako slapped herself in the face. &quot;Onimi. We&#39;ve been through this. 
Time after time after time. I am NOT yours, alright?! Now just get over 
it! If you don&#39;t stop your nonsense then I&#39;m gonna be late for class 
again!&quot;

Yuki blushed a little, pointing at Onimi. &quot;...Is this your girlfriend, 
Minako?&quot;

&quot;She is NOT my girlfriend!&quot;

Of course Onimi didn&#39;t hear a word Minako said (or at least if she did 
then she pretended not to). Her powerful, sneaky eyes rolled from 
happiness on Minako to suspicion on Yuki. The quiet girl whom Minako had 
saved stood silently as Onimi untangled herself from Minako. And she 
began a slow, authoritative march for Yuki. The two of them came 
face-to-face, and Onimi cast a mistrusting gaze straight into Yuki&#39;s sky 
blue eyes.

&quot;And just who...&quot; Onimi began sharply, &quot;Might you be?&quot;

Yuki nervously replied. &quot;My name is Yuki Inoue. I&#39;m a new student 
attending Soryuusuke Gakuen today. Um... I hope we can be friends...?&quot;

&quot;Friends, eh?&quot; The girl with the sexy Okinawa tan stuffed her hand into 
her book bag and pulled out a small, glittering microphone, staring 
straight into Yuki&#39;s face, &quot;WELL LETS JUST GET ONE THING STRAIGHT, MISS 
INOUE! MY NAME IS ONIMI IZAKUMUJI! I&#39;M THE RICHEST GIRL IN SCHOOL! MY 
DADDY IS AT THE HEAD OF THE MOST POWERFUL CORPORATION IN TOKYO! THAT 
MEANS I&#39;M THE MOST POWERFUL TEEN HOTTIE IN THIS CITY! AND IF YOU&#39;RE 
GOING TO BE ATTENDING THE SAME SCHOOL AS ME THEN THERE IS ONE THING YOU 
BETTER BE AWARE OF! MINAKO ENDOU IS MINE! GET IT? MINE! COME BETWEEN US 
AND I WILL MAKE IT MY PERSONAL QUEST TO REDUCE YOUR LIFE TO A LIVING 
HELL! UNDERSTAND WHAT I&#39;M SAYING?!&quot; 

By which time, Yuki was nearly deafened. But she simply nodded, taking 
everything that was yelled at her at face value. Minako scowled at Onimi 
as she lowered that mini-microphone she was holding. By now a few more 
students were passing by and they had heard everything after that 
performance. They all gave the three girls weird looks and Minako sweat 
dropped from that. She had to avoid Onimi more carefully next time. 

Minako charged over to the girl of  Okinawa-descent and scoffed. &quot;Jesus 
Christ, Onimi! Would you PLEASE keep that voice of yours DOWN?!&quot; 

&quot;The more people that know you&#39;re mine the better,&quot; Onimi shot back, 
&quot;I&#39;m just greeting Miss Inoue like I do every new student to our 
school.&quot;
 
All Minako really cared about now was getting to school before she was 
late. But after all Minako&#39;s efforts, she had done just that. That 
classic Japanese school bell went off as usual, and from that, Minako 
realized that she would never get to her first class on time now. But 
she wasn&#39;t the only one to notice this. Minako, Yuki and Onimi looked 
over to the gates of Soryuusuke Gakuen as they heard the slapping of 
light wood against stone. As it so happened, that light wood happened to 
be the thin shaft of a kendo stick. And the person who had it in his 
grip was none other that the head teacher at this school, Principle Goro 
Mishimoto. And with his body swathed in a finely pressed suit and his 
thick glasses over his eyes, Principle Mishimoto pointed his kendo stick 
at the three girls outside of the gates to his school. 

&quot;You there!&quot; Principle Mishimoto called out, &quot;You&#39;re all late for 
class!&quot;

Yuki blinked. &quot;...Uh... but we could just quickly leave to get to...&quot;

&quot;Silence!&quot; Mishimoto bellowed, &quot;I won&#39;t have this kind of behaviour at 
my school, do you understand me? This is an establishment for learning! 
To instruct you kids on the facts of life and to prepare you for the 
harsh realities of Japanese Life! This is not a joke! The first thing 
you must all learn from school is time keeping skills! If you can&#39;t 
arrive at work when they tell you to, how long do you think it is before 
you lose that job?!&quot;

Minako scratched the back of her head. &quot;Um... isn&#39;t lecturing us like 
this going to make us even more late than we already are, sir?&quot;

&quot;That does it!&quot; Principle Mishimoto pointed at all three of them again, 
&quot;Two-hour after school detentions for all of you!&quot;

Which couldn&#39;t have left Yuki any more surprised than she was. &quot;W-Wait a 
minute! I know I was late, sir... but I didn&#39;t say anything...&quot; 

Again, Principle Mishimoto slapped the floor with his kendo stick. &quot;Do I 
look like I care?! All of you have detention after school! Now get to 
class before I throw in tomorrow as well!&quot;

The shoulder of Minako and Yuki hung lowly as they walked straight past 
the older man and into the towering halls of Soryuusuke Gakuen. Onimi 
smirked sharply and strode up to the head teacher of her school. She let 
a slow hand roll into her little book bag and from that she withdrew a 
thick roll of yen. 

&quot;Whoops!&quot; Onimi dropped the roll of yen to the polished shoes of 
Principle Mishimoto, the obviousness in her actions escaping no one&#39;s 
notice, &quot;I seem to have accidentally dropped 200,000 yen to the ground! 
What would happen if some Principle with the power to nullify my 
detention suddenly came up and took that into his hands?&quot;

Principle Mishimoto raised an eyebrow and looked down at the roll of 
money. His kendo stick was thrust against it and flicked the roll of yen 
into his hands. He quickly slotted it into his upper shirt pocket and 
adjusted his glasses. 

Onimi grinned at him. &quot;So we have an understanding?&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh, heh!&quot; Mishimoto slapped his kendo stick against the 
ground again, &quot;You still have detention, Miss Izakumuji.&quot;

&quot;What!?&quot;

The crafty Principle of Soryuusuke Gakuen marched with a skip back 
through the gates of his beautiful and somehow wacky school. &quot;Money 
can&#39;t take the place of education, Miss Izakumuji! But it can buy me a 
nice meal at Shinbunjou! So get to class before I slap you with a second 
detention to go along with the first! Ha, ha, ha!&quot;

Onimi shook her head and followed after Minako and Yuki. &quot;...Crazy old 
man...&quot;
