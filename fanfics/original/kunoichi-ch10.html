Kakugame Jinja

Yui&#39;s eyes fluttered open slowly. She felt light being cast on 
her. Over her cheeks and eyelids. So the girl looked over to the 
side with her freshly opened eyes. She squinted a little. It was 
light for sure. Light peering from between the curtains of this 
room she happened to be in. So when she realized that she was 
nowhere near knowing where the hell she was, she panicked. Yui 
launched herself upward from the waist and realized that she was 
in bed. That made her panic a little less. If someone had taken 
the trouble to do this... they probably weren&#39;t one of her 
enemies. Then she looked over herself. Over her right shoulder 
was a white bandage. It held a soft pad close to her shoulder 
blade. And she could feel something similar on her lower back. 
Not only that... but there was a curious waft in the air. And 
what was coming from her. Yui knew the scent to be of a very 
unique form of medicinal balm. Made by certain shinobi clans as 
treatment for wounds and gashes. Some of it must have been 
placed over her cuts. It smelt a little different from Yui&#39;s own 
&#39;recipe&#39; for ninja treatment oils. It had a stronger scent. 
Which usually meant better results. Yui was surprised. Someone 
had been treating her. But who?

The girl searched her memory. Thinking back to how she got this 
way. All paths of memory led toward Yagami. Her mind grew 
focused and her breath shallow. All from thinking of him. Of how 
powerful he was. And of that ancient family he apparently 
belonged to. The Kagayaku. And the power that he put on display 
for her. Yagami was so skilled. He owed it all to his DNA but 
his mastery was astounding. Now Yagami was bound to use it again 
to protect his master; Hirotsugu. And while he was doing 
that...Yui did not stand a chance against him. Could she ever 
defeat Yagami?

But first... she had to figure out what she was doing here and 
who it was that had treated her wounds. Could it have been 
Hibuki? She did remember him taking her out of the National Diet 
Building with him. But wasn&#39;t he a member of the Six Orochi? Why 
would he help her? Yui tried to ask herself this but couldn&#39;t 
come up with an answer. The Morioka girl looked over to the far 
side of the small room. He heard the door crack open a little. 
It swung open very slowly. To reveal Hibuki. He was dressed in 
his Kimagure Gakuen school uniform. That  made Yui reflect on 
school. Not to mention Haruko. 

Yui watched the calm Hibuki as he walked up to her bed and 
stopped. He crossed his arms and smiled a little. He had some 
bandages and plasters over his body as well. It must have been 
him who brought her here. 

After a little pause, Hibuki was the first to speak. &quot;So. You&#39;re 
awake. You&#39;ve been asleep for half a day, you know that? Those 
fights must have drained you as much as they did me.&quot;

Yui didn&#39;t spare him a smile in reply. &quot;...I can&#39;t believe I 
trusted you. If I&#39;d have known that you were one of the 
Orochi... I would have never...&quot;

&quot;...Started liking me?&quot; The taller youth laughed a little, 
&quot;People can&#39;t help who they like, Yui-san. I suspect that the 
same goes for you and Haruko-chan. You&#39;ve only known each other 
for a few days but you still care about each other. When you 
didn&#39;t turn up for school all she did was worry about you.&quot;

Yui blinked. &quot;...Haruko-san was worried about me? What did you 
tell her?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t tell her anything,&quot; Hibuki said, &quot;But I faked a sick 
note for you. That should give you a few days of peace before 
you have to go back to school. Haruko-chan was a little worried 
when she heard of it. She would have probably gone around to 
your place to look after you if she knew where you lived.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to tell her... in case Hirotsugu-san&#39;s ninja came 
around...&quot; The girl admitted. 

Hibuki nodded to her. &quot;I suspected as much. But Haruko-chan will 
ease up. And you&#39;ll be back to full strength in about four days. 
Genryukai-sama applied some powerful balm he created himself to 
your wounds. They will heal soon. But for now you need to keep a 
low profile.&quot;

&quot;...Low profile?&quot; It was now that Yui remembered how much she 
didn&#39;t understand about this boy. It was time for some answers, 
&quot;I&#39;ve had about enough of this. You have explaining to do. Lots 
of it. Why are you working for Hirotsugu-san? Why are you one of 
the Orochi? Why did you save me? Why-&quot;

&quot;Take it easy!&quot; Hibuki said, stopping her, &quot;...You do deserve 
answers. I&#39;m sure you must be confused. So I guess I&#39;ll start 
right now. I&#39;m on a mission. To kill the Honshu Koga.&quot;

Yui tilted her head curiously. &quot;...Like me?&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot; Hibuki nodded to her, &quot;Although my family don&#39;t know 
anything about it. I&#39;ve been training for most of my life with 
an old master of Ninjutsu called Genryukai. I met him when I was 
around five. He saw that I had potential so he secretly trained 
me for the purpose of killing Hirotsugu-san. At first I wanted 
nothing to do with it. After all I was just a child. But I did 
want some of the power he showed me. When I got old enough... I 
began to see the evil that Hirotsugu had intended for Japan. I 
knew that I had to follow Genryukai-sama&#39;s wishes and kill the 
Honshu Koga. But... unlike you, who went on a damn-near suicidal 
kamikaze mission to finish Hirotsugu-san; I made an effort to 
win his trust. That way I could watch his every move and learn 
of his plans in secret. Which I did.&quot;

Yui looked on at the eldest of the Uchida Siblings. &quot;...What are 
his plans...?&quot;

&quot;...He wants to close Japan from the rest of the world,&quot; Hibuki 
said, his tone more stern, &quot;He actually wishes to return to the 
old Tokugawa policy of a Closed Country. All foreign trade and 
import will be banned. None will be allowed to leave nor enter 
this country. That is his intention. To break the symbiotic 
attachment that Japan has on the world.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that a little senseless?&quot; The Morioka girl claimed, &quot;It 
was because of a lack of foreign influence that Japan suffered 
such a huge economic recession all those years back. My family 
in Morioka never stop talking about it.&quot; 

Hibuki looked over to the curtained window. &quot;Don&#39;t forget one 
thing. It was because of that economic crisis that the Four Koga 
were able to take control over Japan. There may not seem to be 
much sense in Hirotsugu-san&#39;s plan, but trust me. He is devious. 
And he is not stupid.  This Closed Country policy is just one 
step in his future plans. I can feel it. He has an even deeper 
agenda in mind. But I blew my cover too soon to find out just 
what that hidden agenda is. Gathering information on 
Hirotsugu-san is going to be a lot tougher now. The only thing 
left... is to finish him off. I have to kill him. To amend his 
crimes and to protect my family. That is why I fight. That is 
why I worked for the Six Orochi as a spy. And... why I had to...  
force myself to kill Sakamoto-san. I&#39;m not... proud of it. Not 
at all. But my mission comes first. The peaceful lives of 
millions of people are at stake.&quot;

Yui looked downwards, pressing her palms into her 
blanket-covered lap. She now felt sort of embarrassed. &quot;...Um... 
Hibuki-san...?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; The boy said, looking at the country girl. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I said... such mean stuff... to you...&quot; Yui 
offered apologetically, &quot;Back in the National Diet Building. I 
should have known that you could be trusted.&quot;

Hibuki chuckled to himself and pressed his palm into the younger 
girl&#39;s mop of un-brushed auburn hair. &quot;Hey. No need for that. 
You felt betrayed and you were worried about Haruko-chan. There 
is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact... I&#39;m really 
glad you&#39;re looking out for her. Besides. What happened to that 
fiery-headstrong kunoichi whom had called me an &#39;intelligent 
bastard&#39;...? You seem completely different from the way you were 
when you fought Yagami-san and I.&quot;

&quot;...I can&#39;t really explain it, Hibuki-san. But when I put on my 
shinobi gear and fight... I feel like a whole new person. Like 
there is another personality inside of me that takes over when 
my life is at risk. I know that might sound odd, but...&quot;

Hibuki waved it off. &quot;Not at all. Your powers make up for it. 
With the big exception of Yagami-san; I have never seen someone 
as powerful or as skilled as you. I actually had no idea that 
you were the kunoichi that Hirotsugu-san was so afraid of. I 
thought that you might be able to help me against him. Which was 
why I had to test you. Because I wasn&#39;t the only one caught up 
in your power.&quot;

Yui didn&#39;t quite understand what Hibuki was talking about. Until 
he nodded at the door. She looked over there to see who it was. 
And saw a new figure enter the room. A tall, muscular and yet 
elderly man. Holding a long wooden staff in one hand and wearing 
a straw basin hat. The kind that travelling Shinto priests 
tended to wear in the older days of Japan. But on his hairy brow 
was a healthy and defiant smile. Breaking his own age, it 
seemed. 

Hibuki smiled at the far older man. &quot;This is the man who taught 
me my arts. Genryukai-sama.&quot;

&quot;...Hajime mashite&quot; Yui nodded quickly. 

&quot;Hajime mashite,&quot; Genryukai said, grinning in an un-masterly 
manner, &quot;Any girl who can threaten to burst the veins of 
Hirotsugu-san is someone whom I wish to meet. You might not 
believe this, Yui-san, but I have been waiting for a long time 
for someone like you. Someone with the power to stop 
Hirotsugu-san and his plans. Hibuki-kun is strong... but alone 
he cannot stand against the likes of the Mizuryu Clan. Nor... 
the likes of Yagami-kun...&quot;

Yui blinked. &quot;...You know about... that Yagami guy...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know him,&quot; A sad look passed through Genryukai&#39;s eyes, 
&quot;That boy is my grandson.&quot;

That was a bit overwhelming. Yagami was the grandson of 
Genryukai? The two looked so... different. They even acted 
differently. And yet they were family. Then again, Genryukai was 
not the only who had issues with his family. But something else 
occurred to Yui. If Yagami was Genryukai&#39;s grandson; then that 
meant that...

&quot;...Does that mean that you are member of the Kagayaku Family?&quot;

Genryukai nodded to the girl. &quot;Yes. I possess the great powers 
of Kagayaku. Though I did not follow in their footsteps and use 
Kuro-houhou-jutsu. Such power would have corrupted my soul. Just 
like it has with Yagami-kun. My intention was to train him in 
the same arts as Hibuki-kun. I wanted them to be the partnership 
that would bring Hirotsugu-san to an end. But when Yagami-kun 
learned of his bloodline... and of the dark powers I had hoped 
to keep from him... he reacted in a way I hoped would never 
happen. He joined forces with the one other person who could 
bring out Yagami-kun&#39;s hidden potential. That man was 
Hirotsugu-san. In exchange for drawing out his hidden powers; 
Hirotsugu-san made Yagami-kun one of his Six Orochi. The 
super-trained ninja team that Hirotsugu-san uses to handle his 
more delicate affairs.&quot;

Yui looked on. &quot;So that&#39;s why he works for Hirotsugu-san.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Genryukai tapped his straw hat upwards, &quot;...Yagami-kun, 
like most other members of our family; was seduced by his own 
hidden powers. He has fallen so deep into their web... that I 
fear it will be hopeless to make him see sense. His father... my 
son... died because of them. Because he tried to master that 
power... he lost his humanity. His feelings and emotions. He 
went so far as to abandon his wife and child. When my son 
finally died from exhaustion of the Kagayaku power, Yagami-kun&#39;s 
mother also passed on from her grief. Events that I am sure my 
grandson has not forgotten. And Hirotsugu-san used Yagami-kun&#39;s 
insecurities and lust for his own biological power as tools of 
manipulation. Shaping a once innocent boy into the mindless 
killer you encountered in the National Diet. I fear that if 
Yagami-kun is allowed to further discover those dark secrets 
bound to his family... nothing will be able to stop him. If the 
power does not kill him first, that is.&quot;

Yui sighed, looking downwards. &quot;Well he might not be the most 
charming ninja I&#39;ve ever met. But he is very powerful, 
Genryukai-san. Even if Hibuki-san was there with me... I don&#39;t 
think I would stand a chance against him. It was only because 
Hibuki-san helped me that I was even able to survive against 
Yagami-san.&quot; 

A cunning and sly expression crossed Genryukai&#39;s face. &quot;...Do 
not be so sure of that, my dear. The power of the Kagayaku 
Family is legendary. But my ancestors were not invincible. The 
leading family of the Tengu Kokomaru... invented something. A 
technique. Said to give the user the power to stand against 
forbidden arts like Kuro-houhou-jutsu. It is said that only 
bloodline members of that family can use it. The Mizuryu 
Family.&quot;

Hibuki finally spoke up, shocked. &quot;Wait a minute! Mizuryu? But 
what&#39;s that got to do with Yui-san? That&#39;s Hirotsugu&#39;s bloodline 
family. There&#39;s no way she could...&quot;

Yui closed up like a clam, while Hibuki turned his stunned gaze 
to her. Genryukai nodded to no one in particular. Yui gripped 
the blanket of her bed into small balls in between her lithe 
fingers. She had wanted to block that all out of her head. From 
the time she first found herself in Morioka and ever since. 

Genryukai&#39;s smile became more sympathetic. &quot;...You don&#39;t have to 
tell us anything you don&#39;t want to, Yui-san. But I know the 
truth. I figured it out after I heard that you defeated one of 
the Six Orochi. And after learning that Hirotsugu-san wished you 
dead long before you came into contact with the Orochi. It would 
mean a lot to me if you would read the Scroll of Mizuryu. I 
think you are worthy enough. The technique that can fight 
Kuro-houhou-jutsu exists within it. Will you do this...?&quot;

Yui looked up again. This Scroll of Mizuryu might be her only 
chance at defeating Yagami. If she couldn&#39;t beat him then there 
was no way she could get near enough to kill Hirotsugu. He had 
to die. And to make him die, Yagami had to be defeated. And the 
only way to overcome the dark strength of Yagami might be to 
unlock the powers of this Mizuryu Scroll. 

&quot;...I&#39;ll do it.&quot; Yui said, quietly. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Shinrin Jinja

The Room of Fates was more quiet that usual. The vacancy of 
noise was the same. But that silence seemed to take on a new 
feeling. A new meaning. Aside from the odd crackle of the flame 
torches and wisp of the moths that flocked around them; nothing 
could be heard. There was a chill in the air. Hirotsugu was not 
ignorant of it. It was the kind of climate that came to this 
room when new fates were about to be born. The Honshu Koga sat 
silently on the cold floorboards of the Room. His legs folded 
under him. But his attention was not for the air of his room of 
meditation. The attention of Hirotsugu was locked on something 
else. A scroll. Unlike his others; which had been written by 
hand, this was not of his own making. It was older. Something 
that had been passed down through the generations. It was 
glowing a bright blue colour. Holding the kind of power that 
those without great intuition would be blinded to. 

This was the Scroll of the Kokomaru. 

&quot;Soon,&quot; Hirotsugu said to himself, &quot;...The 800-year wish of the 
of the Tengu Kokomaru ... the pride of the Mizuryu Family... it 
will all be realized. Soon...&quot;

A small wind took form in the Room of Fates. Followed by the 
blurred image of a ninja. That just happened to be Yagami. The 
young man landed upon the pine wood floorboards of the room, 
with his powerful Mikazuki Satsujinki glaive attached to his 
back. He did not exert himself much in his battle with Shiki. 
But the little energy he lost was back and he was ready to deal 
out more damage than before. A lot more. Yagami kneeled down 
before his master, Hirotsugu, even though the older man&#39;s back 
was turned. Truth be told, Yagami felt that he had much to be 
apologetic about. 

&quot;Master,&quot; Yagami said, bowing, &quot;...I have searched for 
Hibuki-san and the girl of Morioka. But I have found nothing of 
them.&quot;

Hirotsugu nodded with closed eyes. &quot;I understand. Hibuki-kun was 
clever. And so talented. I needed him as a member of the Six 
Orochi. But... it seems that he hasn&#39;t quite abandoned his ties 
to Genryukai-dono. Your Grandfather is a pesky gnat, Yagami-kun. 
But he is nothing to us now. And Hibuki-kun will pay for his 
treachery with his life. Because as things stand as they are 
now... the only hope that Genryukai-dono and the others will 
have is a last ditch assault upon the Shinrin Jinja. You must be 
ready for them. As Setsuki-kun must be. With the others gone... 
the Orochi must be on top of everything if my plans are to be 
successful.&quot;

Yagami nodded. &quot;Yes sir. I will make sure that Setsuki-san is 
prepared for Hibuki-san&#39;s attack with the Morioka girl. But... I 
must wonder. With the Orochi as depleted as this... the arrival 
of the Sixth Orochi would help us greatly. Do you have any idea 
when he will reach the Shinrin Jinja...?&quot;

A vivid and shadowy chuckle rang in Hirotsugu&#39;s throat. &quot;...Heh, 
heh, heh. The Sixth Orochi will arrive soon. Do not worry about 
that little matter. You are more than enough to handle the 
others with your great power. I leave the security of the 
Shinrin Jinja in your hands.&quot;

Again, Yagami nodded to his Master&#39;s orders. &quot;Understood.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kakugame Jinja

A few hours had passed since Yui had woken up from her long 
sleep. Once she had gotten herself together with a makeshift 
shower (she had to watch those bandages) she then had something 
to eat. This was one of the places that Hibuki had been going to 
without telling Haruko about it. Because of this they weren&#39;t 
short on food. Though Yui had to prepare it all for herself 
since Genryukai didn&#39;t eat all that much. She quickly whipped 
from rice and fried vegetables; then filled herself. She 
couldn&#39;t very well do what Genryukai wanted on an empty stomach. 
Once than was then taken care of she was presented with the 
Scroll of the Mizuryu. She didn&#39;t take much time to admire it 
from an outside view. She simply took the scroll and went into 
something that Genryukai called the &#39;Mediation Room&#39;. A sort of 
hall built into the side of the Kakugame Jinja; Genryukai&#39;s 
small but well hidden shrine home on the outskirts of Tokyo. Yui 
had locked the door behind her and not come out since. 

The Mediation Room was across the inner garden from the pantry. 
Hibuki stood at the glass window of the pantry looking out at 
the room. It was quite silent. Obviously Yui hadn&#39;t attempted 
anything yet. But the Scroll of Mizuryu was said to hold a great 
technique. Just like Genryukai had explained. Could Yui really 
learn to tap into that power? And what chance did they stand 
against the Honshu Koga if she couldn&#39;t? Hibuki couldn&#39;t help 
but ask himself these questions. He had his family to think 
about. They were at risk now that his cover was blown. As soon 
as things were done here; he would be going straight home to 
protect Haruko and his parents. But he had to see what became of 
Yui before he left. 

Genryukai stood across from Hibuki on the other side of the 
pantry. In his hands was the long wooden stick he always walked 
with. But he had abandoned the straw hat for now. 

&quot;Hibuki-kun,&quot; The old master said, &quot;Give her some time. The 
Scroll possesses many secrets. And you know now that she is no 
ordinary kunoichi. She possesses deeper ties to this scenario 
than either of us had imagined possible. And I feel... that 
whether she learns of the sacred skill hidden in the scroll or 
not... she will still go to the Shinrin Jinja. And meet her 
fate.&quot;

Hibuki fixed his eyes on the Meditation Room through the window. 
&quot;I know. I can&#39;t explain it. But I feel like... that girl will 
have an impact on all our lives in some way. She&#39;s already made 
so many waves in this thing since she came to Tokyo. I wonder 
what future lies ahead of her...?&quot;

Neither of them really knew. But both noticed huge burst of Chi 
energy. A Chi that felt both fiery and willowy. A kind of 
tranquil yet burning force. Something that caught both the 
student and master off guard. Genryukai hurried over to the 
window beside Hibuki and then looked out across into the garden. 
The slight gaps in the doorway leading into the Mediation Room 
were lit up with a bright green energy. Strong and silent. 
Making a clear twinge pass through the stomachs of Hibuki and 
Genryukai. Was that Yui&#39;s Chi Force? Yet who else could it have 
belonged to? While both of them debated that; the door the 
Meditation Room swung open in one instant. The brilliant emerald 
luminosity shone to an even more radiant degree as it was fully 
revealed. That light came from a direct source. Yui. The girl 
stood in the doorway of Meditation Room, her jade-colour spirit 
fire burning at full strength. Surrounding her young body with 
its flickering tongues. Yui pressed a hand into the frame of the 
doorway, leaning on it, while the Scroll of Mizuryu was tucked 
under her other arm. Her body looked as nothing more than a dark 
silhouette as it was bombarded with her awakened spirit flames. 
But those eyes of hers parted and opened. Revealing a very 
determined set of eyes that were much more communicative than 
the sweltering green flames that blazed up from her. 

Those eyes demonstrated an even stronger resolve to kill 
Hirotsugu than before. Hibuki &amp; Genryukai looked on at the girl 
as she uttered her first words since entering the Mediation 
Room. &quot;...I understand now. About the Tengu Kokomaru... the 
Mizuryu... the Kagayaku... my duty... my blood... and my 
destiny...&quot;

While watching the burning woman, Genryukai laughed heartily. 
&quot;Heh, heh, heh! So I was right all along! That girl is a blood 
member of the Mizuryu Family! Now it looks is if those fatal 
inner wars of the Tengu Kokomaru... will begin anew.&quot;
