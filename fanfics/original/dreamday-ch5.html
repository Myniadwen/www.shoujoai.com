<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 5 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The months after Jenn&#39;s death were pretty much a blurt to Kris. She felt 
her life worthless without Jenn. She was not allowed to attend her 
lover&#39;s funeral. Kris&#39;s own mother refused to believe her daughter was 
doing such &quot;atrocious&quot; things behind her back. She was sure that she 
would know the instant any of her children were having sex. However it 
never crossed the woman&#39;s mind that Kris could be interested in a girl, 
or was it more that she didn&#39;t want to believe such a thing even when 
faced with it head on. Kris spent the next while in a daze of despair. 
She was forced to attend school even the day after her lover&#39;s death. 
Battered and bruised she remembered how the kids teased her 
relentlessly. Many blamed her for Jennifer&#39;s death. If she only had not 
fallen in love with the girl. 

One day during Home Economics class she overheard a group of boys 
laughing about how Jennifer deserved to die and that she should have 
died along with her lover. Something inside of Kris snapped and she flew 
into a fit of rage. She grabbed a pair of scissors from her desk and 
lunged at the boys. Screaming like a wild animal. It took several 
students to pry Kris off of one of the boys. She was tired, alone and 
had nothing to lose. Someone knocked her off the boy and she tumbled to 
the ground sobbing. While everyone was busy helping the boys to their 
feet, they didn&#39;t notice, or even care, as Kris opened the scissors and 
slashed open her own wrists. 


She was quickly rushed to the hospital. When she awoke she was told that 
she was being charged with assault, however seeing as she never before 
did anything wrong the judge decided to release her into the care of the 
local psychiatric hospital. Where she would remain until her eighteenth 
year. 

******

Kris kicked out in her sleep. She was startled to find herself in her 
own apartment. Disoriented, she stood up and tried to get her bearings. 
The nightmares of those days still circling in her head. She knew the 
doctors said she would have to live with these haunting images for some 
time, but she really wished she could at least get a small level of 
sleep. She moved only to find her entire body aching from sleeping on 
the cold, hard tile floor. Her cat was meowing at her over and over 
again. It was like the cat was an alarm clock and knew exactly when she 
needed to get up. She reached out and patted the cat on the head, then 
watching as it bound out of the bathroom in
search of food.  

She carefully stood to her feet and looked herself over in the mirror. 
She could only see the boi she had become. She ran a hand through her 
mat of hair causing it to fall back in place perfectly. Jennifer used to 
hate this. She would try to ruffle Kris&#39;s hair time and time again only 
to have the girl fix it with one brush of her long fingers. Kris smiled 
at the memory of Jenn pouting over her hair not staying messed up for 
long. Her smile quickly faded when she noticed how dark her eyes were 
compared to her pale skin. She looked rather sick and skinny. It was not 
like she didn&#39;t try to gain weight. She just didn&#39;t feel like eating and 
would simply forget until her stomach was grumbling so badly that she 
couldn&#39;t ignore the pain. 

This morning her stomach was not bothering her to much, however she did 
have a need for some milk and cereal. She knew it was childish, but she 
never seemed to grow out of the sugary cereal phase and discovered she 
needed it more and more. She could polish off four litres of milk in 
under 3 days. It was like some weird addiction. Mind you it was better 
than her families need to consume alcohol every given day. She shook her 
head against the thought of family and quickly ate her cereal, then got 
changed into a white tank top and blue jeans. She stopped to take a look 
at herself in the mirror again. Some have said she had a boyish charm, 
but she didn&#39;t see it. All she could see were the scars that ran up and 
down her long and bony arms from the many times she had cut herself as a 
child. They were no longer visible to anyone, except herself and she 
struggled everyday to keep it that way. She looked down at her thin body 
in disgust. Her chest was almost unnoticeable and she was so thin that 
her ribs stuck out. She was told that her anorexic ways were stunting 
her puberty which is why she was not developing normally. This fact only 
made her more depressed because she was not even aware that she was 
anorexic. Sighing she grabbed her leather jacket, shoved a few things 
into her school bag then slung it over her shoulder and picked up her 
art portfolio. She started out of the apartment, giving a goodbye to her 
cat, before locking the door. 

The sun was high in the air and Kris grabbed her sunglasses as she 
stepped out of the apartment building. It was nice weather and she was 
glad she lived only a few blocks away from school. She saw a few other 
teens walking down the road. No one paid any attention to her, as they 
chattered with friends about life and love. Kris kept her head low as 
she passed a group of girls when someone called out to her. 

&quot;Kris?!?&quot; The voices asked in disbelief from behind her, &quot;Kris, is that 
really you?&quot; Kris looked around to see a tall girl dressed in a military 
sweater and dark green cargo pants. She had bright orange hair that was 
cut even shorter than Kris&#39;s. The sides had been shaved leaving only a 
small amount of curls at the top. Her face was long and covered with so 
many freckles that it looked like one huge blob, &quot;Oh, Kris it is so good 
to see you!&quot; The girl exclaimed. 

Kris blinked a few times trying to arrange her thoughts, &quot;Tanya?&quot; She 
asked in confusion, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I go to Westmire.&quot; Tanya said with a nod towards the school in the 
distance, &quot;What about you? When did you get out?&quot;

&quot;Only a couple of months ago.&quot; Kris answered shyly, Tanya was an old 
friend from elementary school. She was the only girl that knew Kris 
longer than Jenn did and the only person to visit her while she was in 
the hospital.

Tanya blinked at Kris a few times then stared closely at her. 

&quot;Do I have something on me?&quot; Kris wiped at her face in a vain attempt to 
find whatever it was that caught her friends eye. 

Suddenly Tanya reached out and grabbed the girl by both side of the 
head, &quot;When did you dye your hair!?!&quot; She wondered pulling Kris&#39;s head 
in for a closer inspection. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t!&quot; Kris exclaimed as she struggled against Tanya&#39;s grasp. 

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Tanya twisted Kris&#39;s head in the sunlight and watched 
the way the light reflected from the girl&#39;s hair, &quot;I remember it being 
strawberry and now it looks more copper. A cool copper.&quot; She stated 
excitedly.  

Kris finally managed to break free, &quot;You should know that I don&#39;t like 
the smell of dyes.&quot; She retorted, annoyed that she had to fix her hair 
again. 

&quot;Oh right.&quot; Tanya tried hard to think back to the old days, &quot;You usually 
stayed outside when one of the girls got a dye job.&quot; 

Kris turned her head back and forth trying to make it crack, &quot;My hair 
probably changed from all the time I spent indoors.&quot; 

&quot;Oh right... I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t visit you much.&quot; Tanya heaved, ashamed 
at herself, &quot;I meant to come by last month it is just...&quot; 

&quot;It is alright.&quot; Kris answered with a weak smile, &quot;You visited me more 
than anyone else did...&quot; She trailed off and looked at her feet. 

&quot;You parents never showed did they?&quot; Tanya asked, trying to conceal her 
anger. Tanya never liked Kris&#39;s family much. Kris&#39;s little sister used 
to tease the two of them because they both looked so much like boys. She 
really got on everyone&#39;s nerves, but not as much as her mother. It was 
as if the woman couldn&#39;t have a gentle thought to Tanya. She wouldn&#39;t 
even let Tanya into the house. She seemed terrified that Tanya would 
spread some kind of disease. She actually believed that it was Tanya 
that converted Kris to the evils of lesbianism, &quot;Not one of them?&quot;

&quot;Nope...&quot; Kris took a deep breath, &quot;Mom took me in for a bit before I 
got on disability... then she disappeared...&quot; 

&quot;Wait!&quot; Tanya shouted ecstatically, &quot;Does that mean you are living on 
your own?&quot;

Kris only nodded as she started towards the school again. 

Tanya followed closely beside her friend, &quot;As in, in your own apartment 
and all?&quot; She was getting more bewildered with each word. 

&quot;It is nothing to get excited about.&quot; Kris said embarrassed by her 
friends reaction, &quot;It is only a tiny place and it costs way to much.&quot; 

&quot;Can I come by to visit sometime?&quot; Tanya was still excited about the 
concept of living alone, &quot;What I wouldn&#39;t do to be able to get out from 
under my mother.&quot;

They approached the front doors of the school and Kris opened it for 
Tanya, &quot;It is not all it is cracked up to be.&quot; Kris admitted. She would 
rather not live alone. She would love to have a family to return to 
after school. A family that loved her for who she was. 

The two of them didn&#39;t get too far into the school when they came across 
the small crowd of kids. 

&quot;Do you think it is a fight?&quot; Tanya asked trying to look over the crowd. 

Kris looked up at the crowd. She could see a group of boys who had 
surrounded someone and a girl could be heard screaming. Suddenly two of 
the boys lifted a girl over their shoulder. The girl was wrapped up in 
what looked to be silver duct tape. Then the boys opened the boy&#39;s 
washroom door and dropped the girl inside laughing wildly. The girl&#39;s 
cries could still be heard when the washroom door slammed shut. 

Tanya gave the group a look of disgust, &quot;Dammit, Initiation...&quot; She let 
the words drip out of her mouth like acid, &quot;Every year it is the same 
thing. And lately the boys have been abusing the girls more and more.&quot; 
She couldn&#39;t stand to watch and was about to turn away when Kris shoved 
her backpack into Tanya&#39;s arms. 

&quot;Hold this.&quot; Kris ordered, her eyes not moving from the group of girls 
trying to figure out who should enter the washroom. Kris dropped her 
portfolio at Tanya&#39;s feet before pushing her way through the crowd 
towards the girl&#39;s cries. 

&quot;Hey what do you think you are doing?&quot; One of the boys yelled out as 
Kris entered the washroom, &quot;Don&#39;t let her out of there.&quot; 

Kris ignored the boys protests as she pushed the door open. Grabbed the 
girl by the feet and pulled her out of the washroom. The girl was crying 
and shaking. She was wrapped so tightly in tape that no one could pull 
it off. 

Tanya ran over to Kris&#39;s side, &quot;Is she alright?&quot; Kris quickly grabbed 
her portfolio from Tanya and popped it open to find a small sharp art 
scalpel in one of the many pockets, then turned to the girl and started 
to quickly cut away at the tape. 

&quot;What are you doing?!?&quot; One of the boys scolded angrily, &quot;That bitch 
deserves what she got.&quot; 

Kris suddenly looked up at the boy and gave him a wild glare while 
clenching the knife tightly. There was a look of hatred in Kris&#39;s eyes 
and the boy felt that if he got any closer she might actually plunge the 
knife into him. Only when he was far enough away did Kris turn her 
attention back to the work at hand. She smoothly cut away all the tape. 
Tanya helped to tear the stripes off of the girl. It didn&#39;t take very 
long for the girl to be freed and her to run crying in one of her 
friends&#39; arms. 

One of the girls thanked Kris, who returned the thanks with a small 
smile, than the girl helped her friend to the office. 

&quot;Always out to be the prince of the school, huh?&quot; Tanya voiced with a 
chuckle, &quot;You can&#39;t resist it can you?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t turn away from someone who is in trouble.&quot; Kris replied 
slinging her school bag back over her shoulder. 

&quot;Correction!&quot; Tanya countered, pointing at Kris, &quot;You can&#39;t leave a girl 
who is crying. You&#39;ve not changed one bit.&quot; 

&quot;So what?&quot; Kris turned away from her friend, &quot;There is nothing wrong 
with what I did.&quot; She stated, trying more to convince herself than 
anything else. 

Tanya blocked her friend from running away, &quot;Wrong, you can&#39;t save 
everyone.&quot; She stated more worried than angry, &quot;You are just going to 
cause a lot of heart break with that princely act of yours.&quot; 

Kris turned her eyes on her friend, &quot;What would you know about how I 
act?&quot; She asked angrily, &quot;Don&#39;t lecture me about how I act. I&#39;ll live 
the way I want to.&quot; She stormed down the hall. 

&quot;I know what you are doing and she is not coming back.&quot; Tanya called out 
causing her friend to stop in her tracks, &quot;You can try to rescue 
everyone, but one day you are going to have to live in the present and 
not the past.&quot; 

&quot;If you are finished I have to get to my home room.&quot; Kris whispered with 
her head hung low. When Tanya didn&#39;t speak she ran down the hall, 
leaving Tanya kicking at a locker.   

Class 109 was already filled with students. It was a small square room 
with all the desks arranged in rows facing a large blackboard. Opposite 
to the entrance was a wall of windows that stretched all the way to the 
ceiling. Each window was framed with red oak, the same oak that the 
school was originally made in as far as Kris could tell. 

Kris immediately noticed that the teacher was nowhere in sight which 
meant that it was a good time to make new friends and alliances for the 
year ahead. Kris looked around the class from face to face until her 
eyes fell on those of the brown haired girl from the other day, the one 
from the restroom. Today the girl was dressed in a knitted sweater and 
long black skirt, no longer was her hair pulled back in the same pony 
tail, instead it was let loose and hung over her shoulders. Kris 
realized for the first time just how pretty this girl really was. Tanya 
was right about one thing. She had to be careful and keep her heart in 
check. 

Almost as if  feeling Kris&#39;s eyes, the girl suddenly looked up at her 
and smiled. She said something to the group of girls she was talking to 
and then wove her way through the students and desks to where Kris 
stood, &quot;Hey, are you in Mr. Henderson&#39;s class too?&quot; She asked with a 
smile.

Kris just nodded. She couldn&#39;t remember the girl&#39;s name and didn&#39;t want 
to embarrass herself. 

The girl stood there for a moment, playing with her long hair, until she 
finally spoke without looking Kris in the face. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m really 
sorry about yesterday. I sort of jumped to the wrong conclusion. My 
mother told me I have to learn to stop doing that.&quot;

Kris couldn&#39;t stop staring at the girl. Watching the cute way she curled 
her hair around her finger the more nervous she got, down to the way she 
would move from standing on the side of one foot to the other. She 
almost didn&#39;t hear the girl&#39;s apology. Kris shook her head of whatever 
thoughts were trying to invade her mind. Then looked at the girl again 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m used to it...&quot; 

There was an odd silence between the two as they tried to think of 
something else to say to each other when the silence was broken by a 
deep voice from directly behind Kris &quot;Well if it isn&#39;t Kristen Carty?&quot; 
the voice boomed.

Kris looked up to see where the voice came from. Overhead stood a very 
large man in a brown jacket. His brown hair was cut short and he had a 
small mustache. Realizing that this must be Mr. Henderson she spun 
around and gave a short bow. &quot;Yes!&quot; She answered. 

&quot;I&#39;ve heard a lot about you.&quot; The teacher said with a grin. &quot;I&#39;m glad to 
see you could make it. Now find yourself a seat so we can get to work.&quot; 
Kris found herself a seat in the front row against the wall right next 
to the door so she could easily escape if needed. The teacher looked 
around the class, &quot;That goes for the rest of you, Chop chop.&quot; The 
students ran around grabbing the best seat they could. 

The teacher walked over to the large desk that stood in the far corner 
where the chalkboard met the windows. Behind his desk was a set of large 
filing cabinets and a coat hanger in which his coat already hung. He 
shuffled though a few papers that he had in his hands, then looked up at 
the students. &quot;My name is Mr. Henderson and I&#39;ll be your home room 
teacher as well as your morning Art teacher. Each class has a different 
time table for the week. Some days you&#39;ll have line art first thing in 
the morning and others you&#39;ll have 3D arts or something else for that 
matter, however for the most part you will all stay together as a group 
so you&#39;ll have to get along with each other.&quot; There was a small murmur 
from the students. Kris rolled her eyes. She had heard this speak so 
already before. This was going to be a long year for Kris, The teacher 
continued &quot;Now I have your schedules for the first semester here.&quot; He 
looked down at the papers he had in hand. &quot;So who wants to help me hand 
these out?&quot;

The girl Kris just met put her hand up. Which, Kris noted, was right 
behind her in the next row over from where she now sat,  &quot;I will, sir.&quot; 
She said with excitement. How someone could be excited about handing out 
papers was beyond Kris. 

&quot;Thank you ummm....&quot; The teacher said as the girl jumped up from where 
she sat. 

&quot;Sarah!&quot; The girl responded before the teacher could ask a question. 

The teacher handed Sarah a stack of papers. &quot;Could you make sure 
everyone gets their copy of the schedule?&quot; She nodded again. Then the 
teacher turned to the rest of the class. &quot;This is not a real school day, 
however you are required to visit every one of your classes and meet all 
your teachers so don&#39;t run off too quickly. Feel free to talk amongst 
yourselves if you like. Usually this would be a two period class. For 
today you can have the second period free. Now I have to go over a few 
things in the office so don&#39;t get too rowdy, alright?&quot; He then left the 
class to it&#39;s own accord. 

Sarah took the papers from her teacher as he left, than run across the 
room to where Kris sat while flipping through the papers, &quot;Kris 
Carty...&quot; She called out as she took out Kris&#39;s schedule. Why she didn&#39;t 
begin with the top paper confused Kris, but not as much as the smile 
Sarah gave her as she handed over the papers. As Sarah walked away Kris 
hit her head on the wall next to her desk. She had planned not to stand 
out, just concentrate on her school work so she could can finish and get 
out of here as quickly as possible, but she felt that somehow that 
wasn&#39;t going to be that easy and to prove her point one of the boys 
approached her. 

&quot;So you are the infamous Carty.&quot; He put a hand on Kris&#39;s desk and leaned 
in closer to get a better look at the small girl. Kris didn&#39;t move and 
pretended that the boy wasn&#39;t there as she stared at her schedule. He 
leaned closer and whispered something in her ear. &quot;I know where you have 
been, Psycho Dyke.&quot; 

Kris felt herself calmly turn to look the boy in the eyes. She could 
feel her breathing becoming heavier. The boy&#39;s eyes were dark and she 
could feel an amount of hatred in them. She couldn&#39;t, for the life of 
her, figure out what it was that she did to offend this boy. She had 
just met him that moment so how could she possibly have insulted him. 

Sarah finished handing out the papers and returned to Kris&#39;s desk. 
&quot;Jason, will you stop bothering her.&quot; Kris looked up at the girl in 
shock. No one had ever stood up for her. Not since Jennifer, that is. 

Jason stood to his full height and looked Sarah in the eye. &quot;Why should 
I? She is just a psycho and you know it. We&#39;ve all heard the stories.&quot;

Sarah stepped forward &quot;They&#39;re just stories. I can&#39;t believe you think 
she actually killed anyone.&quot; Sarah suddenly stopped herself, but it was 
already too late. The entire class was silently waiting to see what 
would happen next. Kris just sat perfectly still. How could this be 
happening? Who told everyone?&#39; She thought to herself. All she wanted 
was to start over. Why couldn&#39;t they just leave her alone? She never 
killed anyone. 

A grin broke across Jason&#39;s face as he watched Kris start to clench her 
fist and shake. &quot;See? She doesn&#39;t deny it.&quot; He got close to her again 
&quot;Admit it. You did do it, didn&#39;t you? Didn&#39;t yo-&quot; Jason didn&#39;t get to 
finish his sentence. Kris abruptly stood up, turned and gazed angrily at 
the boy. Her eyes were no longer their soft blue, more of a blood red. 
She suddenly struck out with both hands and shoved the boy over the desk 
behind him and into the next row. Everyone watched in complete shock how 
such a little girl could throw a boy, who was a foot taller than her, 
over a set of desks. He came crashing to the ground in the next aisle.      

Kris started to sway, she grabbed her head with one hand and reached out 
for her desk with the other, but missed. Sarah reached out and caught 
the girl before she fell to the ground. Kris blinked several times. 
Nothing was clear and she couldn&#39;t even remember how come she was 
standing, never mind why this girl was holding her arm. She looked 
around to see Jason start to get to his feet. He was rubbing the back of 
his head which hit one of the desks. He glanced at Kris and then to 
Sarah before moving to the far end of the class. All the other kids were 
staring at Kris. She looked from face to face and knew she had done 
something horrible, but couldn&#39;t remember what it was. All she knew was 
they were looking at her with accusing eyes. Kris looked from her 
classmates to Sarah and back again. Not being able to stand the stares 
any longer she grabbed her things, pushed past Sarah and out of the 
classroom. She ran down the hall and around a corner into one of the 
stairwells where her legs started to give out on her again. She gave up 
and leaned against the wall and slid into a corner, curled up there and 
began to whisper to herself. 

&quot;Jenn, I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m really sorry.&quot; She mumbled not being able to 
hold back the tears anymore not really caring. They already thought she 
was a killer. What difference would it make if they knew that she was an 
emotional nut case as well? She wasn&#39;t a murderer and she knew it. She 
couldn&#39;t remember what happened, but she didn&#39;t kill anyone. She only 
wanted them to stay away from her. If they just left her alone none of 
this would have happened. As long as Kris was with Jennifer she didn&#39;t 
have problems with her anger. All Jennifer would have to do was touch 
Kris&#39;s hand and all the hatred would melt away, now she has nothing to 
help her control that anger, nevertheless she promised that she would 
not hit another soul. That she would be a good girl like everyone 
wanted, all the same it was too late now and already she was in trouble 
again. &#39;Why doesn&#39;t anything ever work out? Why?&#39; Kris continued this 
thinking while curled up in the stairwell. She did not hear the 
footsteps approaching or maybe she just couldn&#39;t care less. 

A hand gently touched Kris&#39;s shoulder &quot;Hey, You alright?&quot; Kris heard a 
soft voice ask. There was actually concern in the voice. Kris wiped the 
tears from her eyes with the back of her hand and looked at who was 
kneeling next to her. She was surprised to see Sarah&#39;s face looking at 
her. There was worry in the girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;Listen, ignore Jason. He&#39;s 
just an idiot and doesn&#39;t know anything. I wish he had gone to some 
other school.&quot;

Kris straightened up a little and leaned against the wall, &quot;Did I hurt 
him?&quot; She asked softly.

Sarah let out a small laugh &quot;His ego maybe. I was amazed to see anyone 
knock him off his feet. He deserved that.&quot; She settled onto the floor 
next to Kris.

Kris whispered, &quot;I.. I don&#39;t like hurting people. I shouldn&#39;t have done 
that but...&quot; She looked down at her open palms and clenched her hands 
then opened them again.

Sarah stopped Kris&#39;s left hand from closing and traced a finger along 
the white scar. &quot;That looks like it must have hurt.&quot; She wondered, 
gently touching the scar.

Kris stared at her hand, &quot;Not really. It tingled a little, but after 
that there wasn&#39;t any pain.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Sarah inquired looking up at Kris with curious eyes.

Kris was about to speak when she stopped herself. She quickly pulled her 
hand away and stared at the girl, &quot;Why do you care? You&#39;d probably think 
I&#39;m even more insane if you knew.&quot; Kris could feel anger welling up 
again. &#39;Why was this girl being so friendly?&#39; No one really cares about 
how she felt, so why would this girl be any different? 

Sarah looked at her shoes, &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to pry. I&#39;m always 
sticking my nose where it doesn&#39;t belong. Sorry.&quot; She noticed Kris&#39;s 
class schedule laying at her feet and picked it up. &quot;Hey, what classes 
did you pick? I&#39;m only so-so at arts, but I was told that I have 
potential.&quot; She let out a nervous laugh, &quot;There are so many other 
classes I&#39;d love to take, but I don&#39;t really know anyone here. Aside 
from Jason that is, we used to go to the same school if you&#39;d believe 
that.&quot;

Kris looked that at the paper &quot;All I&#39;m really good at is art. Although 
I&#39;m supposed to be a good writer and I took a few classes of acting 
while in junior high, but nothing special. I also used to sing, but 
don&#39;t anymore.&quot; 

Sarah&#39;s eyes began to sparkle &quot;You can sing? Really? Can I hear?&quot; She 
begged. 

Kris looked at the other girl in disbelief. This was one strange girl. 
She almost reminded her of... she shook the thought from her mind. Kris 
was frozen by the girl&#39;s stare. Finally she found the will to look away 
and stood up to look around and see if there was anybody else around. 
The hall was empty and everyone was still in class. She turned back to 
see Sarah was quietly waiting to hear Kris&#39;s voice. If she had continued 
to simply beg, then Kris would have found it easier to refuse, however 
those eyes wouldn&#39;t leave her alone, &#39;What to sing?&#39; Kris thought, 
&#39;Something soft so it won&#39;t echo and at the same time...&#39; A small smile 
came across her face and she looked down at Sarah, then took a short 
breath. Her newly healed ribs didn&#39;t allow much room for air to enter 
her lungs. The doctors told her she would have to be careful and not 
breath too hard. She closed her eyes and thought about the perfect song. 
Sort of her little test to see how the girl would react to her. 

She closed her eyes, searching her mind for a song that was soft and 
slow, but at the same time would harmonize with the pain she was feeling 
in her heart. The lyrics to  &quot;Somebody&quot; by Depeche Mode started to 
develop in her mind. This was one of the songs she used to sing to 
Jennifer all the time and it had been a long time since she last sung 
it. She took yet another deep breath and began to softly sing. Just 
saying the words was painful and she had to force herself not to choke 
on the tears that threatened her with every passing line. After a bit 
she completely forgot her surroundings and became lost in the lyrics 
themselves. Kris listened to her voice as it softly echoed throughout 
the stairwell, not really realizing. Somehow, Kris could feel Jennifer 
standing behind her, encouraging her to finish the song, no matter how 
much her ribs hurt.

She got to the last note of the song and let it drift up the stairs and 
down the hall. She didn&#39;t open her eyes once during the song afraid that 
she would see horror on Sarah&#39;s face. She waited to hear some sign of 
how awful she truly was, however what she heard shocked her. Someone 
began to slowly clap. Kris opened her eyes to see Sarah was still 
sitting in front of her with an odd, awe struck, look on her face. The 
clapping increased to her left and for the first time she noticed that 
the door to one of the classes was open and now a bunch of kids were 
crowding into the hall. The teacher was the first to clap followed by a 
few of the students and more. Kris blushed in embarrassment not sure 
what to say. It turned out that the stairwell Kris chose carried every 
note though the halls. Three classes could hear her singing including 
her own home room class which had now all the students standing in the 
hall. She saw Jason standing in the door. He snarled then stomped back 
into the classroom. 

Sarah jumped to her feet and ran over to Kris, &quot;That was beautiful! I 
love that song.&quot; She exclaimed excitedly.

Kris&#39;s blush deepened and she found it hard to speak, &quot;Th... thank 
you...&quot; 

A couple more girls gathered around her talking about how much they 
loved Depeche Mode and they all tried to convince Kris that she should 
join the music class. Kris was overwhelmed by the sudden show of 
attention that she couldn&#39;t get out more than a mere &quot;yes&quot; or  &quot;no&quot; 
every now and then.  Many thought that maybe Kris would make a good 
actor and started talking about her playing a prince role in a play, 
which Kris quickly backed out of. Mr. Henderson came down the stairs in 
time to save Kris from another wave of questions. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you are getting along.&quot; He said smiling at Kris, &quot;I 
forgot to assign your lockers. You can pick any from 70 - 97 range.&quot; He 
said nodding in the direction of a row of lockers.

The group of girls started off to find their lockers before the teacher 
told everyone else.   

Sarah laughed as she followed Kris down the hall, &quot;Not used to this much 
attention?&quot;

Kris gave the girl a small glare. &quot;Who is the one who started this?&quot; She 
stopped at the first top locker in the line and opening it, stated, &quot;I 
wanted to just go to school and not have to deal with anything, you know 
what I mean?&quot; She fished in her bag for her lock. 

Sarah put up her hand defensively, &quot;I didn&#39;t force you to sing, that was 
all your doing.&quot;

Kris gave the girl a long disbelieving stare. She suddenly realized that 
she was going to have to watch out for this one. Either she was very 
good at using her cuteness as a weapon or... Kris didn&#39;t want to think 
about it.

&quot;Do you mind if I take the locker next to yours?&quot; Sarah asked, looking 
in the locker to see if it was clean. 

&quot;Do what you like.&quot; Kris tossed a couple of books and her gym clothes 
from her bag in the locker and decided that she would have to bring in 
some pictures to decorate it later. Just then the bell rang. 

&quot;I have to get going.&quot; Sarah looked disappointed. &quot;I have to talk to the 
councillor about my schedule.&quot; She forced a smiled, &quot;What lunch do you 
have?&quot; She asked while tossing her bag in the locker and locking it. 

Kris looked down at the schedule she was about to magnet to the door of 
the locker, &quot;Fourth period.&quot; She said looking further down the list.

&quot;I have the same.&quot; Sarah said with a smile, &quot;Maybe we can eat together.&quot; 
She chewed on her lip and looked at the ground. A second bell rang at 
that moment, &quot;I have to get going. I&#39;ll talk to you later alright?&quot;

Kris was still confused as to what was happening, &quot;Oh.. ahh... alright.&quot; 
She stammered and watched as Sarah ran down the hall. Kris shook her 
head. This was turning to be quite a beginning to the year. She turned 
around and started up the stairs, then towards the auditorium, where she 
remembered seeing a line of benches between its closed doors. She found 
herself a seat on one of the benches and stretched out across it with 
her back to a small wall. She grabbed a book from her bag and was about 
to read when she was interrupted. 

&quot;Hey, Handsome!&quot; Tanya called out. Kris looked up to see her friend 
walking towards her. She sat down next to Kris, &quot;Listen I wanted to 
apologize for what I said earlier. I know you have been through a lot 
and you need to cope in any way you can. Right?&quot; She asked with half a 
smile. 

Kris gave a weak smile, &quot;No, you are right... I should have been more 
careful.&quot; She said curling her legs up against her chest, avoiding 
Tanya&#39;s eyes.

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Tanya inquired leaning back on the bench with her 
arms crossed.

Kris rolled her head back on the wall and stared up at the ceiling, &quot;Oh, 
nothing much. Just
serenaded half the bloody school.&quot; She let out a half a laugh, half a 
sigh. 

Tanya looked at the girl in shock &quot;You sang?!? You&#39;ve never sung around 
me.&quot; She stressed out, disappointedly 

Kris rolled her head away from her friend and looked at the line of 
awards that filled the far wall, &quot;Well you probably will never hear me 
sing. I don&#39;t know why I even bothered to do it today. My ribs still 
hurt.&quot; She rubbed her lower chest.

&quot;Soooo...&quot; Tanya poked Kris in the arm, &quot; What song did you sing? 
Something new?&quot; 

Kris let out another sigh and put her feet up closer to herself, when 
she spoke it was but a whisper, &quot;Somebody&quot;

Tanya leaped up, &quot;YOU ARE KIDDING ME!! Somebody?!? As in the Depeche 
Mode song you used to sing all the time to Jennifer?&quot; Her voice echoed 
in the halls

&quot;Hush would you?&quot; Kris breathed, grabbing the girl&#39;s sleeve and pulling 
her back into the bench.

Tanya slowly sat back down and recovered from the shock,&quot;So, that is why 
you looked so miserable when I saw you here, huh?&quot; She watched Kris out 
of the corner of her eye while whispering, &quot;So, who is the girl?&quot; She 
smiled. 

&quot;She is no one. Just some girl I met yesterday. It is nothing really.&quot; 
Kris said nonchalantly.

Tanya leaned closer to Kris, &quot;You&#39;re going to be alright?&quot; She asked in 
concern. It had been a long time since the two of them were friends, but 
she knew the girl rather well and she didn&#39;t want to loss her so soon 
after finding her again. 

Kris return her friends gaze. She set her head on her knees, &quot;I&#39;ll live, 
I always do.&quot; She said as she buried her face in her knees. 

Tanya patted the girl on the head, &quot;I wish I could help you. I really 
do.&quot; She stood up, &quot;Listen, I&#39;m only on an errand for my teacher. When 
is your lunch?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;Fourth period.&quot; Kris mumbled. 

&quot;Good, we have the same lunch.&quot; Tanya said as she stood, &quot;I&#39;ll see you 
later then.&quot; She didn&#39;t want to leave her friend, but didn&#39;t know what 
she could say to ease the girl&#39;s pain. 

&quot;Later.&quot; Kris said, not lifting her head. Tanya began to leave, then 
stopped to look at Kris one last time, before walking around the corner. 
Leaving Kris to her thoughts.
