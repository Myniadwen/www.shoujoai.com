<h1>All Girls School (part 99 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch98.html">Back to Part 98</a><pre>&quot;The Field Trip&quot;

Frankly, Rozalia Miklos was looking forward to this field trip more than 
anything else. School had been rough just getting into, and there was no 
such thing as &quot;settling in&quot;: she still hadn&#39;t found her groove, or her 
niche, or whatever girls fell into to get comfortable. Her road was 
pocked with potholes and speed-bumps: she didn&#39;t have any friends, 
homework was more than stressful, she was now grounded from her 
cherished video games, and that crazy redheaded dike of a Dijk was still 
picking on her. Why she ever volunteered to go to that all-important 
anime club in her stead was beyond Rozy&#39;s comprehension. Perhaps she 
just felt like being really kind, and maybe this was the thing that 
would push her into a more sociable atmosphere. Yeah, right.

So when word got around that the drama class was going on a field trip, 
she did everything in her power to make sure she was on that list. With 
the class bearing only a handful of girls, she was bound to make a 
friend somewhere, or at least make her name known. It was already early 
in April&#151;spring had returned at last, though some meteorological force 
had kept it at bay&#151;and with Spring Break out of the way, it was a long 
stretch before Prom, the finals, and for the seniors, graduation. Rozy 
didn&#39;t want to waste another minute.

Ms. Post took a head count to make sure all her students were there. 
Blake, Janine, and Gabrielle were clustered together as always; Alisha 
was helping Jocelyn around (she was very large by this point, and even 
amateur observers said that she&#39;d have that baby any day now); Ana was 
off sulking by herself, bemoaning the absence of her sweetheart (Rai 
dropped out of drama around midterm); Hero and Ayanna held hands and 
spoke quietly to each other; Farrah, Rozalia, and May acted standoffish; 
Mira was being awfully quiet, but the broad smile she had on said 
enough; Alexis had her arms crossed, looking every bit the rebel.

&quot;I suppose that&#39;s it,&quot; said Miss Post, checking the list a second time. 
&quot;All right, everyone on the bus please.&quot; She didn&#39;t have to say 
that&#151;everyone nearly stampeded to get on, anything to have the whole day 
away from school. They were going to some Shakespearian Renaissance 
thingy several counties over, but they could&#39;ve been going to a torture 
chamber for all they cared. The driver was a stoic, heavy-set man who 
didn&#39;t seem willing to speak, and the bus reeked as all yellowish school 
buses did.

&quot;Couldn&#39;t we have afforded a Wombles bus?&quot; moaned Walker, sighing 
against a window. &quot;Those things are so nice. Plush chairs, overhead 
compartments, a bathroom... And some of them have TVs! What do we have 
but this ordinary thing?&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; grumbled Janine, &quot;and it doesn&#39;t even have seatbelts. Talk 
about a lack of safety. What happens when we crash?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d have thought they&#39;d come up with something by now,&quot; said X, her 
voice in agreement. &quot;They got every single mother-fucking thing built 
into these new cars&#151;airbags, seatbelts, special emergency breaks, 
absorbent crap like that&#151;but oh no, not for buses. We just crash and 
splat, like every other good American.&quot;

&quot;Speak for yourself!&quot; spat Mira, kicking Alexis&#39; seat. &quot;In Amsterdam, 
every bus has seat belts!&quot;

&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s where ya hail from. God, with all that Danish ambiguity, 
you could&#39;ve come from anywhere.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t come from Amsterdam; I just know a bit about it. I&#39;m 
Denmark-ish.&quot;

&quot;You sure you&#39;re not from the Nether-Netherlands?&quot; muttered Gabrielle 
with a smirk. Mira snorted.

&quot;Oh, as if you&#39;re one to talk! You and your Welsh girlfriend!&quot;

&quot;Hey, my girlfriend is a hundred percent Teutonic, and proud of it.&quot; The 
conversations became mixed and blurred after that, everybody talking 
about everything and nothing, and then some. Seated next to Alisha, 
Jocelyn moaned softly as the bus hit several bumps and clutched her 
protruding abdomen. She didn&#39;t feel very well&#151;every shake felt like it 
was helping spit her unborn child out&#151;but she deserved this vacation as 
much as anyone, and was totally adamant about coming. She had her cell 
phone with her, Janet Keys and Erica Fox on the top of the call list, 
and Alisha had hers too to be sure. She didn&#39;t hold any special feelings 
towards the younger girl, but if she was Erica&#39;s friend, then she would 
watch over and protect her.

&quot;Beginning to think this was a bad idea?&quot; she asked above the din. 
Jocelyn fought to smile.

&quot;Oh, only when the bus rattles, which is about every half-second. 
Ha...needless to say, I don&#39;t get out as often as I used to, or maybe I 
should say I&#39;m unable to. My mother can&#39;t take me anywhere except on 
weekends, of course&#151;&quot;

&quot;You mean Keys?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah, her. She said it was okay if I wanted to call her mom. 
Anyway, this was the best way for me to get out.&quot;

&quot;And away from that brat of a girl we both love to death,&quot; she remarked 
playfully, ribbing Joss. McKeough laughed softly, but didn&#39;t put up much 
of a fight. Pregnancy was harder than she thought it would be, despite 
the support her friends gave her. She was off the soccer team, perhaps 
for the whole year, and once the baby came, things would only get more 
hectic. Of course, her foster mother volunteered to help care for the 
boy or girl once it came, and Alisha and Erica voted the same. Even Mira 
van Dijk promised to procure a service.

Mira van Dijk&#151;Jocelyn McKeough&#151;Rozalia Miklos. They had met in that 
anime club, and though Rozy was more shy than a turtle, she did show an 
interest in Japanese animation, among other things. Mira was in love 
with the poor blonde by this point&#151;no mistaking it, it was genuine love, 
even stronger than what she had felt for Blake and Usha&#151;and if Rozy knew 
about it...oh, what fireworks would go off!

&quot;Hey, let&#39;s start a gambling pool,&quot; whispered Ayanna to Gabrielle and 
company. The three girls seemed interested and asked for details. &quot;Okay, 
here&#39;s the deal. Word has it that the resident Dijk has a big huge thing 
for the newbie there&#151;the girl wearing fatigues.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you must mean Geek Goddess number three,&quot; said Janine. Ayanna 
chuckled.

&quot;It&#39;s a name we came up for them,&quot; explained Blake. &quot;Mira and Jocelyn 
know about it, and they seem pretty proud. They&#39;re numbers one and two, 
respectively. We call them geeks because, let&#39;s face it, you&#39;ll find 
nobody so enthralled with anime, Final Fantasy, Lord of the Rings, Harry 
Potter, Star Wars, and all that other crazy crap. And we call them 
goddesses because, let&#39;s face it, they&#39;re all freaking hot.&quot;

&quot;You should not say that,&quot; piped Janine; &quot;you have a girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I know, I&#39;m just stating the obvious. I can still wave my opinion 
around, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, just make sure it don&#39;t hit nobody in the eye,&quot; remarked 
Gabrielle. Blake swatted at her, and the two slap-fought like apes for 
awhile, leaving Janine to sigh. She was beginning to wish she had sat 
near someone else, anyone really. Well...not May. She still couldn&#39;t 
confront the older girl after the...unpleasantness of late March.

But was it really unpleasant?

&quot;Shut up, brain,&quot; she muttered to herself. Then, &quot;So what&#39;s this about a 
gambling pool?&quot; Ayanna made a face.

&quot;Oh yeah. Well, if a certain redheaded someone hadn&#39;t interrupted me, I 
would&#39;ve said that we should have a gambling pool going on concerning 
the Geek Goddesses. You all know how Mira pines over that blonde girl, 
right?&quot; They certainly did, having to listen to her sigh wistfully in 
nearly every class or meeting. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll wager that the two of them 
end up as a couple by the end of this semester. Whaddya say, odds?&quot;

&quot;Ten to one,&quot; said Gabrielle, holding Blake&#39;s attack off. &quot;Mira and Rozy 
don&#39;t have a chance in Hell. Mira&#39;s way too outgoing, and Rozy&#39;s not 
outgoing at all. Besides, the way she picks on her and all...&quot;

&quot;Oh, I say it happens,&quot; said Blake. &quot;I mean, opposites do attract, and 
they are the Geek Goddesses, after all, so they&#39;re bound to have some 
things in common. Besides, Rozy looks like a lezzie.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not something you can tell just by looking,&quot; insisted Janine. 
All three girls rolled their eyes.

&quot;Oh yeah, like you&#39;re one to talk!&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; she groused, &quot;just shut up, all of you.&quot;

.........

&quot;Hey, Rozy!&quot; Rozalia saw a girl about her age running up, dressed 
comfortably without anything feminine touching her skin. Now that spring 
was here, her bare arms could once again proudly show off a plethora of 
temp tattoos, ranging from hearts to dragons and even a frightening 
Pikachu skeleton. If memory served her correctly, this was Farrah Kwong.

&quot;Uh, yeah?&quot;

&quot;Glad I caught up with you,&quot; said Farrah, looking placid. Wait a 
minute&#151;hold on! People didn&#39;t say that to her! Nobody was ever glad to 
see Rozy&#151;heck, hardly anyone even knew her name. Naturally, she was 
befuddled for awhile until Farrah explained. &quot;I hear you&#39;re one of the 
few girls here in this school that doesn&#39;t have a girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Uh...yeah,&quot; she said unsurely, &quot;why should I?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a very good question,&quot; admitted Kwong, smiling. &quot;Why should we? 
I for one can&#39;t stand the sight of all those crazy lesbos, and since you 
seem cool on the matter, I thought we could stick together for the sake 
of convenience. It&#39;ll give me peace of mind knowing there&#39;s someone else 
out there who&#39;s so intolerant to the insanely heavy Sapphic overtones in 
this school.&quot;

&quot;Um...okay...&quot; You lost me, Rozy wished she could say. She finally 
blurted it out and added, &quot;So...you kinda had me at the whole friend 
thing, and then...busted.&quot;

&quot;Sorry. I would like to be friends, if it&#39;s okay?&quot; And Rozalia, as glad 
as she wanted to be, couldn&#39;t help but feel suspicious.

&quot;...Why?&quot;

&quot;Why not, I say. And I know it&#39;s none of my business, but sources say 
you don&#39;t hang with much of a crowd.&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; she admitted. &quot;I think people are repulsed by me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, only because you&#39;re new,&quot; she scoffed. &quot;Give it time. I was the 
same way when I transferred here. Of course, I still am, probably 
because I keep getting overshadowed by my butthead of a best friend.&quot; 
Rozy snickered, and demanded to know who this so-called butthead was. As 
wet as her ears were, even they had picked up the name of Ivory Tran, 
and knew it well.

&quot;So...you&#39;re friends with a gay girl, but you don&#39;t like other gay 
girls, am I right?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the strange truth,&quot; sighed Kwong. &quot;But Ivory and I go way, way 
back. We&#39;ve got a kind of &#145;bond of sisterhood&#39; thing going. Now that I 
think about it, I always did seem to be her lackey&#151;getting into trouble, 
or having to bail her out of a jam. I&#39;ve tried shrugging it off, saying 
we&#39;re friends and all, but there&#39;s only so much debt a person can 
forgive.&quot;

Amazing. Simply amazing. If Rozy didn&#39;t know any better, she would&#39;ve 
sworn she was holding an actual conversation with an actual person, and 
they weren&#39;t walking away, giving her lectures, saying anything 
pointless, or otherwise doing anything to prove to her how much of a 
nitwit one or the other was. Farrah was, in short, being nice.

&quot;She sounds like a real character,&quot; she admitted with a smirk. &quot;And you 
sound like you love her very much. Um, not in the gay sense, I mean.&quot;

&quot;I know what you meant. I honestly think I&#39;m the only woman Ivory&#39;s ever 
loved without there being anything lezzy about it. Eh...&quot; She grimaced 
and crossed her arms, feeling uncomfortable. Yep, this was it&#151;the Curse 
of Rozalia was finally setting in. But it was not to be: &quot;Sorry, my 
vocabulary&#39;s not good today. Must be this whole absent from school 
thing.&quot;

&quot;Yeah&#151;without Miss Madsen here acting like a drill sergeant, we&#39;re 
getting dumber by the minute!&quot; The two laughed&#151;Rozy was surprised to 
hear her own chuckle coming out&#151;and spoke some more, of this and that. 
Farrah later introduced Rozy to Vai&#151;&quot;Another soul enlightened to the 
delights of heterosexuality&quot;&#151;and that, she said, was that.

&quot;What about those two?&quot; she pointed, indicating May and Janine. Farrah 
looked at Rozalia as if she had just revealed she was an alien from the 
planet Shizzlewizzle.

&quot;Are you serious?!&quot; she balked. &quot;Those two?! As if! I&#39;ve never seen a 
couple more involved with each other! They deny it like crazy, of 
course, but it doesn&#39;t take a Sherlock Holmes to figure out they&#39;re 
crazy about each other. It&#39;s even more disgusting than if they were just 
flaunting it casually like everyone else!&quot; Rozy turned colors, and 
looked again at Tramble and Bautista. They were as distant from each 
other as they could be, and hadn&#39;t even shared a word since the other 
day. She didn&#39;t know what to think, so she just shrugged and crossed her 
arms.

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Farrah said, calming down now, &quot;I think we better go. This 
school may be full of lesbians, but I&#39;d rather stick close to a bunch of 
crazy girls than be lost in this medieval nightmare.&quot; Rozy and Vai 
agreed, and took to following their &quot;new friend&quot; as they rejoined the 
rest of the group.

.........

The festival itself was a refreshing break from the drudgery of school. 
Everything was colored with a brilliant, fantastic hue, especially the 
people, many of whom dressed to match the time period. There were 
jugglers and knife-throwers, fire-breathers and sword-swallowers, 
jesters and clowns, and even a Shakespeare look-alike contest going on 
yonder. The music was as delightful and old European as anyone could 
hope for (Post wished that Sarah Jo could be there&#151;it was the sort of 
thing she&#39;d swoon for), although the food lacked in taste and value. 
Everyone generally had a good time, but for some, the entertainment was 
cut short.

Jocelyn had tried her very hardest to squeeze some entertainment from 
this day, but the child inside her was stubborn. It kicked like a mule, 
and even a simple shifting around made her uneasy. That there was a Life 
inside her own body gave her great joy, but she wanted that kid out as 
soon as possible. Dr. Andrews herself said that the baby would come any 
moment now, and gave her professional opinion to oppose Jocelyn going on 
that field trip...

And then it happened. A deadly, beautiful, strange, invigorating lurch 
struck her, the mother of all jerks, and the unmistakable feel and fear 
of her water breaking hit her mind. Weakened and now soiled, she let out 
a soft cry of pain, but kept her head as she grabbed for her cell phone. 
Her fingers shook violently as she punched the few keys that would 
summon her foster mother.

&quot;Joss?&quot; came Janet Keys&#39; voice&#151;she probably already knew what was 
happening by the sound of it.

&quot;Mom, it&#39;s happening!&quot; she managed. A fraction of cold silence choked 
her world.

&quot;All right, stay calm. Where are you?&quot;

&quot;The field trip. The fair. I don&#39;t know where exactly.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad I checked,&quot; mused Janet to herself as she paused for a moment. 
She was looking up a list of hospitals that were local to the fair. She 
didn&#39;t want her foster daughter to go out like that without being 
prepared, and took the time to look up all the maternity wards she could 
in that area. She called the one closest, then went back to her 
daughter.

&quot;Honey, I called the hospital; they said they should be there in about 
fifteen minutes. Are you going to be okay?&quot;

&quot;In fifteen minutes?&quot; she squealed, managing a smile. &quot;Um, no, I feel 
like I&#39;m gonna explode.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, sweetheart. Is Alisha there with you?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s off...somewhere. I&#39;m all by myself now.&quot;

&quot;Honey,&quot; sighed Janet, &quot;I warned you about that. You of all people 
should have somebody around you.&quot;

&quot;I know, but&#151;&quot; She cut herself off as another spasm of pain hit her. 
Janet panicked as the young woman she called a daughter groaned, and 
spoke as hastily as she could.

&quot;Sweetie, find somebody and get them to help you. I&#39;ll stay on as long 
as I can.&quot;

&quot;Will you go to the hospital with me?&quot; she wailed feebly. Janet gasped 
softly.

&quot;You know I&#39;ll be there, honey. I&#39;ll ask Ms. Marbel for the rest of the 
day off; she owes me something anyway. Should I call anyone else?&quot;

There was only one other person Jocelyn wanted by her side at a time 
like this.

&quot;Erica,&quot; she managed. &quot;Please call Erica for me.&quot;

&quot;Will do. Hang in there, sweetie. I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too...mom.&quot;

.........

Geek Goddess number three, Rozalia Miklos, found Jocelyn first and 
rushed to her aid, regardless of their nonexistent relationship. After 
confirming that the mother-to-be was in as good a shape as she could 
possibly be in at that time, she ran off and found Ms. Post, who took 
Jocelyn to the nearest medical tent. The doctors there were actually 
fairly experienced with improv births (whether that was a good thing or 
a bad thing remained debatable), and treated miss McKeough as well as 
they could until the ambulance came. The whole festival seemed to freeze 
when it drove by and took Jocelyn into its safety, and students and 
revelers alike were kept wondering long after it passed.

Poor Jocelyn couldn&#39;t handle the whole thing, and passed out peacefully. 
She honestly couldn&#39;t recall anything after that, except that she had a 
short dream about being a radio DJ or something unusual like that. It 
was pretty funny, to say the least, and a good means of entertainment 
until she woke up in a hospital room, dressed in those awful 
embarrassing hospital smocks, laying in a bed with her legs prepped up 
like a whore&#39;s. There were about three doctors in there&#151;a woman and two 
men, all of them murmuring quietly&#151;and with them was the more welcome 
sight of Janet Keys, looking stressed and rushed but otherwise glowing 
with happiness.

&quot;You with us?&quot; she asked. Jocelyn couldn&#39;t talk, so she nodded. &quot;That&#39;s 
good. You had quite a rest there. Lazy miss McKeough, who gets to sleep 
soundly while everyone else worries about her.&quot; She pinched the girl&#39;s 
toe and wiggled it playfully.

&quot;I didn&#39;t...really worry anyone, did I?&quot; she whispered. Keys chuckled.

&quot;Only with that unsightly weight you&#39;ve gained over the past nine 
months. I swear, we need to put you on a diet, girl.&quot;

&quot;Ma,&quot; she said with a grin, &quot;I&#39;m serious.&quot; Janet gave her beloved foster 
daughter a motherly smile, and held her hand.

&quot;Well, you&#39;re one of the lucky ones. Aside from passing out there for 
awhile, this pregnancy should be pretty standard. They say the baby&#39;s 
going to come out prematurely, but it&#39;s only by a few days. Maybe the 
little one&#39;s just as impatient as we all are.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she managed. Now that she had her bearings straight and her 
voice back, Jocelyn looked around the hospital room, its sterile smell 
infecting her lungs, and through the clarity of pain, wondered where 
Erica was.

&quot;Her father&#39;s driving her,&quot; answered Keys. &quot;She&#39;ll be here shortly. You 
sure picked a good time to have that baby.&quot;

&quot;Well...sooner rather than later.&quot; Jocelyn felt another stab of pain, 
but the doctors didn&#39;t seem aware of it. It was probably nothing to 
worry about if that was the case, but Joss still wondered if she had 
been drugged yet. With a wince she asked about it, and got several 
Yeses. &quot;Oh,&quot; she murmured smarmily, &quot;well, that&#39;s a relief.&quot;

Erica&#39;s father dropped her off some time later. She told him she would 
hitch a ride with Mrs. Keys once all this was over, and promised him 
she&#39;d give him the hospital phone number so they could contact each 
other. Janet was there to greet her, having been told of Erica&#39;s 
arrival, and guided the young woman to the room. Despite the big, proud 
smile on her face, she couldn&#39;t help lacing her words with anxiety.

&quot;She&#39;s not herself now,&quot; whispered the woman. &quot;I know it&#39;s just the 
pain, and hormones, and so many other things, but it&#39;s like looking at 
another person. Her mood shifts dangerously&#151;one minute she&#39;s weeping and 
happy, and the next she&#39;s cursing and raving&#151;but I really can&#39;t blame 
her. Erica, she called for you so much.&quot;

&quot;...I know,&quot; said Fox thickly. &quot;Let me see her.&quot; Janet squeezed the 
young woman&#39;s hand as she escorted her into the room, and left the two 
alone for a bit. No matter what moods Joss was going through now, she 
pushed all of them aside and gave a very healthy, very normal smile to 
her friend.

&quot;Hey, godmother Fox. Glad you could make it. The doctors say I only have 
a few hours left. My contractions started not long ago. You might&#39;ve 
heard me screaming halfway across the state.&quot; Erica giggled.

&quot;Yeah, Mrs. Keys said you weren&#39;t acting normally. Who would&#39;ve thought 
that little Jossy had a banshee in her?&quot; Jocelyn&#39;s face contorted 
quickly into a mask of pain, and she winced so strongly that Erica 
feared she&#39;s crush her own eyeballs. She took Joss&#39; hand and squeezed it 
firmly. &quot;Joss, I&#39;m here,&quot; she assured her.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she replied hoarsely, &quot;and this pain of mine hasn&#39;t gone down 
one fucking bit since it started. Sorry, I...don&#39;t mean half the things 
I say.&quot; She let out a vicious scream all of a sudden, wailing and 
thrashing like one possessed, and nearly broke Erica&#39;s hand apart as she 
crushed it in her grip. Amazing! That sweet, loveable, kindhearted 
Jocelyn could be so feral like this! But Erica knew it wasn&#39;t just the 
pain of pregnancy that was destroying her: it was pain of loss, and 
regret, and deep sorrow. This child would have no father, and the 
monster that killed him still lurked around, killing many more potential 
mothers and fathers. The only thing Erica could do was hold her hand and 
endure this storm.

&quot;Erica,&quot; Jocelyn wailed, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry! I&#39;m so sorry! So stupid, so 
stupid, so stupid, so stupid...&quot; She whispered this again and again, 
breaking poor Erica&#39;s heart with every word.

&quot;No, no, you&#39;re not stupid, Joss. What kind of talk is that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m such a fool,&quot; she managed, crying and smiling at the same time. 
&quot;Such a god-damned fucking moronic idiot. I should have seen it. I 
should have...known...uggh!!! Always there, always there,&quot; she 
whispered, no longer making sense&#151;&quot;Always there, she was always there 
for me, always there, so stupid.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Erica Fox. Jocelyn took a deep breath, and in 
the middle of that hurricane, she reached its eye.

&quot;It&#39;s true, what they say,&quot; she said peacefully. &quot;You really can&#39;t think 
clearly unless it&#39;s through a curtain of pain. It&#39;s the ultimate mental 
cleanser. I was such a fool to give this up,&quot; she said, holding her hand 
up along with Erica&#39;s. She smiled beautifully, perspiring and still 
suffering, nearly breaking dear Erica&#39;s heart with the wonder of it all. 
&quot;I don&#39;t know what possessed me to give you up like that,&quot; she said, 
firm and clear as anyone who had seen such revelations. &quot;The fact of the 
matter is that I was foolish. You were the best friend in the world to 
me, Erica, so why should I give a damn if you&#39;re in love with me? I want 
to be with you, I&#39;m sure of that now. Please, Erica, find it in your 
heart to forgive this silly mother, and take her back into your world. I 
want to love you so much,&quot; she wept, &quot;so much! I love you, Erica Fox, I 
love you so...much...&quot;

Moments such as this required great lengthy periods of thought in order 
to work properly, but Erica didn&#39;t get this. Instead, the storm came 
back, Jocelyn started wailing again despite the drugs, and doctors and 
nurses finally swarmed around her, saying that this was the beginning. 
Wait a minute&#151;the beginning?! Then what was all that before, just a 
prelude? It seemed that way, and Erica was ushered out of the room.

&quot;No!!&quot; barked Jocelyn madly. &quot;I want her to stay in here, you fucking 
bastards! Don&#39;t you take that woman anywhere, you fucking hear me? She 
stays in here or so help me God, I&#39;ll bite my tongue off and bleed to 
death! I&#39;ll do it, you filthy mother-fuckers!!!&quot;

&quot;Easy there, babe,&quot; murmured Erica, too shocked to feel anything save 
annoyance. &quot;Jeez. You&#39;re worse than Alisha when it comes time to get her 
shots. You&#39;d think that a girl who&#39;s that pierced wouldn&#39;t be afraid of 
a little needle.&quot;

&quot;Shut the fuck up, you god-damned beautiful angel, and get the fuck over 
here!&quot; Erica knew she didn&#39;t mean a word of it&#151;Jocelyn was openly 
weeping and scared for her life. The doctors knew it was impossible to 
fight this, and so they let her stay on as a kind of midwife. Janet Keys 
was allowed in later, standing in as the mother of the patient, and 
together the three of them weathered the most awful and most wonderful 
thing ever in human history.

Four hours later, in the still silence of the afternoon, Jocelyn 
Elizabeth McKeough gave birth to a healthy son. In tears she suckled him 
and announced his name.

Theodore Eric Henderson McKeough.

Even the doctors wept.

Nobody knows

Just why we&#39;re here

Could it be fate

Or random circumstance

At the right place

At the right time

Two roads intertwine

And if the universe conspired

To meld our lives

To make us

Fuel and fire

Then know

Where ever you will be

So too shall I be

Close your eyes

Dry your tears

&#39;Coz when nothing seems clear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Weary heart

You&#39;ll be safe here

Remember how we laughed

Until we cried

At the most stupid things

Like we were so high

But love was all that we were on

We belong

And though the world would

Never understand

This unlikely union

And why it still stands

Someday we will be set free.

Pray and believe

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

Save your eyes

From your tears

When everything&#39;s unclear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Wounded heart

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

In my arms

Through the long cold night

Sleep tight

You&#39;ll be safe here

When no one understands

I&#39;ll believe

You&#39;ll be safe,

You&#39;ll be safe

You&#39;ll be safe here

Put your heart in my hands

You&#39;ll be safe here</pre>
