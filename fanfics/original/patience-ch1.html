<pre>	Tap, Tap, Drag, Tap, Tap, Drag.  Rhyan bit back a groan and 
settled for clenching her jaw a little tighter.  This keeps up and I&#39;m 
going to break my teeth. Tap, Tap, Drag, Tap, Tap, Drag.  She opened her 
eyes and  was caught in the pale, laughing green of her girlfriends 
eyes.  &quot;Problems dear?&quot;  
	Problems? Why in the world would I have problems?  It&#39;s not like 
you&#39;ve been teasing me for an hour now.  Nope, No Problems, None at all.  
Rhyan&#39;s answer was a small indifferent smile before turning back to her 
puzzle.  The ball, warm under her fingers, failed to pull her attention 
away from the others movements.   No matter how hard she tried the rings 
were not as interesting as the cool metal that was being played across 
her stomach.  Tap, Tap, Drag, Tap, Tap, Drag. 
	Rhyan rolled the small sphere between her palms, pulling it down 
and studying each of its many marks as she had done countless times 
before.  Tap, Tap, Drag, Focus Woman!  Focus!  Tap, Tap, Drag.  She 
heard a quiet laugh, barley escaping pink lips.  And then the pen was 
pulled away and the quiet rustle of paper could be heard. &quot;Done...&quot; Rhyan 
again looked up at her lover to see her folding the newspaper, 
apparently having finished her own puzzle.  She found herself, as she 
often did, studying the other woman.  Starting at her deep auburn hair, 
braided and pulled over her shoulder.  Down to those pale green eyes, 
nearly white and full of laughter.  The corners, as usual, crinkled with 
mirth.  Small nose barely upturned at its end.  Full, pink lips, parted 
slightly give a tiny peek at white teeth and the shadow of a tongue.  	
	Biting her own lip Rhyan&#39;s gaze traveled back up to eyes she knows 
so well and a brow wrinkled in amusement.  &quot;Something funny?&quot;   Not 
expecting an answer she moved to the smooth neck, following it down to a 
shoulder that disappeared under a black t-shirt.  My t-shirt.  The 
thought tugged a smile from her.  She would have continued her visual 
exploration had the other woman not been sitting with the bedcovers over 
her lap.  So instead she sat up, leaned forward and licked the smiling 
woman between the eyebrows.  That action caused a snort and two small 
hands to push against her shoulders dropping her on her back once again.  	
	&quot;You&#39;re a dork.  I&#39;ve mentioned that right?&quot;  Her smile grew as 
the voice, words almost a whisper, reached her ears.  &quot;An incredibly 
patient, well behaved dork this morning.&quot;  A warm finger took up tracing 
the stomach the pen had so recently abandoned, the nail making slight 
scratching noises across flesh. Tap, Tap, Drag, Tap, Tap, Drag.  &quot;You 
didn&#39;t try to interrupt me once, let me finish the whole cross-word 
without trying to do it yourself.&quot; The movement stopped and the entirety 
of the hand was splayed across her stomach, just above the belly button, 
comfortable on weather worn skin.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;  The sentiment was 
punctuated by a kiss placed next to the hand.
	And it was hard earned, that kiss.  Rhyan was easily frustrated 
when something was not quickly solved.  Be it a real world problem or a 
puzzle.  If she herself knew how to solve it that is.  And more often 
than not she did.  Rhyan  preferred to spend a few moments studying a 
problem before attacking it, leading to her solving them much faster and 
in very few tries.  So it took a lot of self control for her to stay 
still and let Nara be while she worked on the crossword.  Which is what 
the small spherical puzzle was for, a way to keep Rhyan&#39;s mind busy.  
And it worked, the Isis supposedly being the hardest 3-D puzzle ever 
designed, typically kept her busy when she was playing with it. Letting 
the clever mind work through it while only occasionally moving a piece.  
However when faced with Nara or the puzzle...Nara is way more interesting. 	
	Sliding her larger hand over the one on her torso Rhyan trapped it 
there while she sat back up.  &quot;Your welcome. Very, very, welcome.&quot;  
Stretching forward she touched her lips to the corner of Nara&#39;s mouth, 
turned her head and did the same to the other side.  &quot;As long as you 
enjoyed it.&quot;	
	The hand on her stomach scratched lightly over sensitive skin 
before winding its way up and beating a baseline on tan ribs.  &quot;But it 
drove you nuts didn&#39;t it?&quot;  Nara leaned into Rhyan placing a soft kiss 
on her nose. &quot;Made you crazy? Want to climb the wall?  Yell out the 
answers?  Leave the room?&quot;  At each new suggestion she placed little 
kisses across Rhyan&#39;s face.  While her free hand took up continuing the 
former pattern on a bit of muscled thigh. Tap, Tap, Drag, Tap, Tap, 
Drag.
	&quot;A little, maybe.&quot;  Nara closed her eyes, savoring the feeling 
Rhyan&#39;s voice created.  Tiny vibrations moving through her hand and 
across her whole body.  Even those words, soft and simple as they were, 
rolled out of the woman like thunder.  Part growl, part pant, all Rhyan.  
The feel of hands on her folded knees brought Nara out of her thoughts 
leaving her face to face with her lover.  Dark, sometimes too intense, 
brown eyes stared back at her.  One black eyebrow was arched in a silent 
question, in way of answering she leaned forward, &quot;thank you.&quot; It was 
whispered against soft lips, more movement than sound but the gentle 
squeeze of a hand on her knee assured her that it was understood.  
	Pulling back she once again encountered that eyebrow.  Its 
companion twitched when she slid off the bed and thin wrinkles appeared 
across a furrowed brow.  Pulling Rhyan over till she could reach her 
Nara smiled and licked between her brows, and smiled when she felt 
Rhyan&#39;s laugh vibrating through both of them. &quot;Breakfast?&quot;  Stepping 
away she waited for her counterpart to follow.  &quot;I could eat, somebody 
took forever this morning, stupid puzzle...&quot;  Looking over her shoulder 
Nara noticed the small smile on the other woman&#39;s lips, well that&#39;s all 
right then.
