<a href="../original/artemis-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Shannon Mcgee had a faintly awed looked on her face as
she and Athena walked away from the dean&#39;s office at
the university. &quot;I can&#39; believe you managed to force
&#39;im to back off,&quot; the slim redhead admitted.

&quot;It helps having the proper paperwork in hand,&quot; Athena
smirked, the blonde warrior patting the folder tucked
under her arm. &quot;The letters from the ACLU, GLAAD and
others probably made him sit up and take notice.&quot;

&quot;Not to mention my expert testimony,&quot; Circe smirked,
the golden haired sorceress looking positively impish.

&quot;Thank you both,&quot; Shannon said softly, &quot;when I told
you about the harassment, I ne&#39;er really expected to
get help...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re my student,&quot; Athena shrugged calmly. Her lips
tightened a bit, &quot;Besides, he was clearly a bully..
once he was confronted he backed off.&quot; She looked at
their other companion, &quot;I think you looming in the
background made him nervous, too.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Sam grinned, the brown haired priest&#39;s
collar gleaming white on her black garb.

Shannon&#39;s eyes were curious as she said to Athena, &quot;So
you&#39;re a swordswoman, lawyer, and work in a bar.. what
other secrets are you hiding?&quot;

Athena grinned, &quot;I&#39;m a woman who wears many hats, you
haven&#39;t seen all of them just yet.&quot;

Shannon bowed, &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to seeing them.&quot;
She smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;d better get to m&#39; dorm, let my
roommates know I&#39;m not goin&#39; anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Athena laughed as Shannon headed off.

&quot;I know you&#39;ll want to linger here a bit,&quot; Circe said
to Athena with a knowing grin, &quot;Sam and I will just
head back to the bar.&quot; She sighed a bit glumly, &quot;I
have some work to do and I think Sam and Descent have
plans...&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Athena nodded to Circe then gave Sam a
look, &quot;be careful, please.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Sam nodded as the two walked away as well.

As always Athena felt quite comfortable walking the
halls of learning, going down the paths with an almost
instinctive knowledge. As the goddess of wisdom this
was one of her homes, in many ways, and she could
almost feel her power manifesting around her. It took
a conscious effort to make her way towards the front
gate, instead of finding the library and settling in
with research.

&quot;Athena?&quot; a surprised voice called out questioningly.
Turning around Athena saw Margaret standing nearby,
the beautiful redhead looking at her with a frankly
curious expression on her face.

&quot;Margaret,&quot; Athena nodded to the woman in recognition,
her unique gifts instantly tagging her as a teacher at
the university. &quot;I thought I saw you at the Daughters
last night,&quot; she said as they fell into step, the
breeze stirring their clothes.

Margaret looked a bit sheepish as they walked between
the buildings. &quot;You were very busy,&quot; she admitted, &quot;I
didn&#39;t want to bother you.&quot;

&quot;Next time come up to the bar and talk,&quot; Athena smiled
at her, &quot;I can manage to converse and sling drinks at
the same time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; Margaret flashed a grin. Curiously she
said, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you on campus
before...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not my usual place,&quot; Athena said dryly. She gave
Margaret a thoughtful look, &quot;In fact you might want to
avoid me, or you may be in trouble with the dean.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Margaret said in surprise.

&quot;One of my students was having some problems,&quot; Athena
said flatly, &quot;and I suspect the school&#39;s dean wasn&#39;t
pleased with how I handled it.&quot;

&quot;Shannon Mcgee?&quot; Margaret guessed.

&quot;You know about it?&quot; Athena felt a faint bit of alarm.

Margaret looked faintly uncomfortable. &quot;Several of my
students have complained,&quot; she admitted, &quot;they find
her practices disturbing.&quot;

Athena felt a sharp moment of betrayal at the woman,
and her voice went oddly flat. &quot;The freedom of
religion rules on campus protect her as much as the
good Christian children who likely complained,&quot; she
said with a bit of bitterness.

Margaret sighed, &quot;I&#39;ve offended you, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Athena saw the honest regret in the woman&#39;s face, but
that didn&#39;t ease her annoyance. &quot;I&#39;d better get back
to the Daughters,&quot; she said briskly, &quot;I&#39;m skipping out
on work as it is.&quot;

&quot;But I was hoping...&quot; Margaret started.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Athena cut her off then strode away at a
brisk pace.

Margaret looked after her, feeling like the fragile
connection between her and Athena had been cut with a
knife. Turning away she made herself walk to her next
class, silently wondering what else she could have
done. She had an obligation to listen to student
complaints, and if she agreed with them she would
never say so out loud.

&#39;So how did Athena know that?&#39; Margaret thought
guiltily as she entered the English department&#39;s
building. She headed to her classroom and entered
briskly, moving up to her desk as she saw her students
gathering. She sorted out her papers, trying to get
her thoughts in order then looked up as the bell rang.
&quot;All right,&quot; she said, &quot;today we&#39;ll be discussing...&quot;

&quot;Sorry, sorry,&quot; Shannon Mcgee blurted as she hurried
in, clutching her books. The redhead sat at the back,
giving her classmates a sheepish smile.

Margaret felt the hostility in the class, the students
glaring at the oddball and suddenly she had enough.
&quot;Excuse me,&quot; she said sharply, striking her desk with
her palm and bringing all eyes to her. &quot;I&#39;m well aware
of the prejudice Miss Mcgee has been facing and I have
had enough!&quot; There was shocked silence in the room as
she continued, &quot;Freedom of religion is just that, and
I expect you all to treat her as you would wish to be
treated. Is that understood?&quot;

Students looked at each other uncomfortably, then a
brave one started, &quot;But ma&#39;am...&quot;

&quot;Is that understood!&quot; Margaret didn&#39;t even make it a
question that time.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; the students mumbled, looking down at
their texts to avoid meeting her eyes. The only person
looking up was Shannon Mcgee, who gazed with
astonishment.

Margaret looked away, feeling vaguely uncomfortable as
she went back to work. &#39;Did I fail Shannon that badly
in the past?&#39; she wondered, lecturing almost on
automatic. She handed the students their assignments
and sat down to mark, passing the time between
classes.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Shannon said, stopping in front of her
desk.

Margaret looked up, meeting her eyes as she answered
honestly, &quot;Don&#39;t thank me... I only did what I should
have done a while ago.&quot;

&quot;Still, I appreciate it,&quot; Shannon said. She moved to
leave then stopped at the door, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind my
asking... what prompted that?&quot;

&quot;I do mind your asking,&quot; Margaret admitted, &quot;but I&#39;ll
answer. I had a talk with a friend who reminded me
what a hypocrite I&#39;ve been.&quot;

&quot;Either way,&quot; Shannon said as she headed out, &quot;thank
you.&quot;

Margaret kept at her work a few minutes when she felt
another presence at the door. The older man smiled
wryly, &quot;I heard from a student you made quite a
scene.&quot;

&quot;Professor Bennet,&quot; Margaret nodded formally to her
department head, &quot;yes, I guess I did. Is there a
problem?&quot;

&quot;Actually all the departments just got word from the
dean,&quot; Bennet sounded amused, &quot;we&#39;re now supposed to
step firmly on any signs of prejudice. He&#39;s not naming
Miss Mcgee herself, but the message is pretty clear.&quot;

&quot;Good to know,&quot; Margaret sighed.

&quot;You don&#39;t sound pleased,&quot; Bennet noted in fatherly
tones.

Margaret smiled up at her friend and coworker. &quot;Just
wondering how I got to be such a spineless drone in
search of tenure,&quot; she admitted wryly.

Bennet gave her a sympathetic look, &quot;You can be
forgiven for a instinct for self preservation.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Margaret didn&#39;t really agree, thinking of the
disdain she&#39;s seen in Athena&#39;s eyes.</pre>
