<p>“Dark Side of the Moon: Selene’s embrace”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>At first the Acherons attributed the sensations they  were experiencing to fatigue. After all, they had taken control of  the ship from Aseria ever since leaving Pluto, and they had scarcely  rested since. But then their weariness was strengthened by  loneliness, silence, emptiness, a forbidding chill, and even despair.  There was no scientific cause for this as Fuuka gave them a bill of  excellent health, and there was nothing particularly wrong with the <em>Dauntless</em>, as the repairs from Avatar were still holding  strong. Kay and Tee had only noticed this change once they were  within reach of Gaea’s moon, and it became stronger still as they  circled it for a landing. The strength of this misery came as an even  greater shock when they remembered that this is what they used to  feel all the time, before they left their homeworld.</p>
<p>“This is what Earth and her orbit feel like,” Eve  suggested as the crew gathered together. Everyone else noticed the  distinction as well and demanded an explanation from the natives  onboard. “When Allegra, Riene, the twins and I left it for space,  we immediately noticed the change. I know this may not make any  sense, but Space no longer felt like space to us.”</p>
<p>“It was like being buried under hot blankets and then  suddenly bursting out of them,” Allegra said.</p>
<p>“Or walking in the dead of winter and then turning  around to see spring,” Riene added.</p>
<p>“Or breaking away from <em>Space</em> into the <em>Heavens</em>,” Amy murmured.</p>
<p>“But there’s no scientific explanation for this!”  Valti exclaimed, gesturing like a windmill. “Why should Gaea be  different from any other world? What makes it so special?”</p>
<p>“We really can’t say,” Eve said, getting nods  from her fellow Gaeans. “We just thought that the change only  extended to the band right outside our orbit. I don’t know what  else to tell you.”</p>
<p>“Whatever it is, you’ll get used to it,” Allegra  murmured.</p>
<p>“I don’t think I want to,” Alala hissed, and  several others agreed with her. In the end, Amy had to demonstrate  her resolve once more, and followed the handful of natives onto the  lunar surface. Since it was generally considered that if a lame,  nearsighted bookworm could handle it, anybody could, the crew filed  in and prepared for a taxing adventure.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Earth’s moon has, of course, played a vital role in  all cultures since the dawn of time, and no author has the skill or  the resources to fully catalogue humanity’s ode to their haunting  neighbor. It has been Mary, holy virgin pregnant with promise;  Artemis and Diana, wild goddesses of the hunt; and Aphrodite, the  embodiment of love. It was Selene and Luna, Phoebe and the Buffalo,  the Old Man and the Rabbit; it has been called Sulva, Domina Oriens,  Nanna, Thoth, Mani, Tsukoyomi, Rahko, Tecciztecatl, and many others  (in fact, Chandra was given the Hindu name for <em>Moon</em>). Jules  Verne sent a team of explorers to it a hundred years before the  launch of Apollo 11; Arthur C. Clarke buried a legendary alien  monolith beneath its surface; C.S. Lewis suggested a civilization  lived on the “far side” 150 years before it became a reality.  Even Lillianne knew about the Moon: the poem she had recited on that  empty world described an apocryphal warrior-queen imprisoned in its  depths. Now, though, it was just another pit stop for travelers, with  75 percent of the surface covered by domes and construction, a  rank-and-file shell of her former solemn glory.</p>
<p>The Sea of Tranquility had been faithfully preserved  for centuries, however, and was one of the few places left on the  moon that actually <em>looked</em> like the Moon. Two monuments stood  out, though, that continued to draw a stream of humble pilgrims. One  was the image of Armstrong’s first footprint upon the lunar  surface, exactly as it had been six-hundred years ago, a symbol of  humanity’s “giant leap” into the heavens. Directly next to the  print was a plaque that commemorated the opening ceremonies of the  Space Exploration movement thirty years earlier. All the major  languages of the Earth had been inscribed on the plate; it read,  “‘<em>Supra luam sunt aeterna omnia: Beyond the moon are all the  eternal things’ — Cicero</em>”.</p>
<p>As usual, everyone was left to their own devices once  they arrived. There were malls to shop at, tours to take, a museum, a  handful of observatories, a place where you could rent a moon buggy,  garages, stores, hospitals— every convenience of home. Just as  Allegra predicted, everyone adjusted to the irregular sensations, and  soon it felt like any other world, or at least any other world with  no natural atmosphere. Those who spent their whole lives on Earth  adjusted the fastest, but this made them even more curious about the  celestial phenomenon. Amy had a fairly good idea what it signified,  but she kept it to herself since it would be incredibly hard to  prove.</p>
<p>Allegra and Kate decided to distance themselves from  the others and go on a date. Lady van Landingham wanted to prove that  she was not uncomfortable with being in love with another woman (even  though deep down she was, a little), and taking some time out just  for the two of them seemed the best way to go about it. She felt she  needed to be honest with Kate, and as they took a buggy out to  Tranquility, she revealed her feelings.</p>
<p>“Ya gotta understand that it’s not the principle,  just the change. I had a husband I loved and children I cherished,  and I had to leave all that behind cuz’ of what I did. I do love  you and I want to move on with my life, but that isn’t somethin’  you can just <em>do</em>. Oh wow, would ya look at that!” She pointed  to a white streak in the far distance: a shooting star was crossing  Earth’s atmosphere. Everything seemed a little nearer and more real  on the moon, even with helmets protecting them from glare and  desolation as far as the eye could see. Kate saw it too and smiled.</p>
<p>“I understand. We’re taking it slow, but I’m okay  with that. Now where’s this monument supposed to be?” Kate was  poorer with directions than Allegra and couldn’t even make sense of  the map they had. On the other hand, years of wandering North America  had given Allegra an excellent sense of where she was and where she  was going, and she found the monument faster than most tour guides  would. The two ladies gently hopped out and shuffled across the dusty  landscape, careful not to move too suddenly. Kate was accustomed to a  world with much heavier gravity, and so it took her a lot longer to  adjust; she kept panicking and underestimating her steps. Allegra  tried to help her, but she couldn’t help but laugh at the woman’s  clownish antics. By the time they arrived at the monument, they were  both worn out and had drained more oxygen than necessary.</p>
<p>“Feels like that time on the Necropolis,” Allegra  murmured. That too had been an airless wasteland, but the moon had an  eerie sense of beauty about it compared to the bleak desolation of  the Graveyard Planet. If one died here, one felt like they could be  at peace, cradled by Selene and Tranquility. They could see all of  Deep Heaven spread out before them and so there was less to fear—  less, but not nothing. Allegra’s comment caught the attention of  another pilgrim, who bounced over with equal clumsiness.</p>
<p>“Did you say ‘Necropolis’?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah.”</p>
<p>“You mean you’ve actually been there? I thought I  was the only— ” The stranger stopped herself and peered into  their visors. It was a little difficult to see, but it looked like  she recognized them. “That makes sense!” she laughed, shuffling  closer. “No wonder you knew what it was like! We meet again.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, we can’t see you very well, and these  radios don’t do much for the voice.”</p>
<p>“Right, right, I’m sorry. I ought to reintroduce  myself: it’s been quite awhile since we’ve seen each other. Marsa  Rosemont, at your service.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah!” Allegra exclaimed, reaching out to grab  her glove. As the crew of the Dauntless explored the galaxy, they  seemed to meet more friends and run into more enemies; this woman was  certainly one of the former. She was the ex-High Priestess of Tigris,  who had performed the wedding ceremony for Alala’s mother and  stepmother, as well as purified Rajani, participated in the Dauntless  Cooking Contest, and visited the Necropolis with Allegra, Yenae,  Kyrie, and Alala.</p>
<p>“So what’re you doin’ on the Moon?” Allegra  said. “Just passin’ through?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I came to pay homage to the place where ‘it  all started’— at least for humans, anyway. I’m on my way to  Gaea.”</p>
<p>“So are we! Maybe we’ll run into each other.”</p>
<p>“I hope not,” she replied, smiling sadly— though  they could not see this subtle expression. “The job I’m going to  will be very dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Then maybe we should tag along. Twenty-five has to  be better than twenty-four.”</p>
<p>“No, I could not possibly impose,” she murmured.  Allegra and Kate both gave her a friendly pat on the back which, in  that gravity, has the same effect as a firm push.</p>
<p>“Hey, you helped us out plenty of times! Besides,  it’s not like we’ve never risked our necks, or our schedule’s  set in stone! So where are you headed?”</p>
<p>“Well, if you must know,” she blushed, “I’m  going on a sacred journey from a region called Cheena to a region  called In-die-a.”</p>
<p>“Is it very far?” Kate asked. Allegra was confused  until she realized that Marsa might not know how to pronounce certain  country’s names.</p>
<p>“Oh! You mean from China to India! By the great horn  spoon, woman, I hope you ain’t thinkin’ of walkin’ that far!  That’ll take you years!”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t thinking of going the whole journey on  foot,” she replied humbly. “But regardless of how I get it done,  I must follow that exact path.”</p>
<p>“What for?” Marsa didn’t answer them at once.  Instead, she checked her oxygen, which prompted Allegra and Kate to  do the same.</p>
<p>“Perhaps we can continue this discussion indoors.  Don’t worry, I won’t set out without telling you. I would be  honored if I had some companions with me.”</p>
<p>“I think we’ll stay here a little longer first,”  Kate said. They waved goodbye and watched Marsa putter away in her  buggy. Kate now had a dozen questions about the Earth, but now was  the time for silent reflection, for awe and inspiration, for privacy  without the interference of outside agents, regardless of their  importance. They left ten minutes later, and did not say a word until  they removed their suits, relieved to break free of them.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Is this seat taken?” Rebecca smiled feebly at  Riene, who happily offered the empty chair to her. It was good to see  her taking the initiative, even for something as small as this.  Rebecca was still trying to adjust to her new wings— she had to  re-tailor all her clothes or else learn how to fold them up— but  she was putting a brave face on, and she even gave Riene a little  smile.</p>
<p>“So what are they planning?” she asked, referring  to Marsa and the group huddled around her. Riene flipped the hair out  of her face. She really ought to have it cut soon…</p>
<p>“Well, you know how Lyara said she’d help Sharyn  find that last artifact?”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah. Very romantic.”</p>
<p>“It is,” she gushed. “But from what I’ve  overheard so far, there’s more treasures to be had. Apparently Lady  Rosemont stumbled across something and would like to explore. Looks  like we’ll be on Earth for awhile.”</p>
<p>“That’s your home planet, right?” Riene nodded  wistfully (if a nod can be considered wistful) and stared out the  windows, past the stars to the magnificent sapphire orb in the sky.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m an Earthling, born and raised. I’m  European, actually— Italian if you want to be specific…although  it’s been centuries since anybody’s used all those old names.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you’re talking over my head,”  Rebecca answered. “I don’t know much about Gaea. It’s a little  embarrassing, being such an unseasoned bounty hunter.”</p>
<p>“But you’re learning along the way,” Riene  replied. “Isn’t that the whole point of the journey? I’m sure  all the greats have done something like this. You’re following in  their footsteps. Anyway, the Earth is…well, it’s hard to  describe. It’s sort of like one enormous melting pot of human  culture. They used to have all these countries and regions, and there  are more languages here than there are in half the galaxy. Why, if I  started talking in my native tongue, I don’t think anybody else  could understand me!”</p>
<p>“How many languages <em>can</em> you speak?” she  wondered, feeling entranced. Riene really had to think about that.</p>
<p>“Hmm…off the top of my head, I’d say I’m  comfortably fluent in at least a hundred, and I can do a fairly  decent job with at least fifty more. I know a smattering of some  eighteen languages that derive from others, and given enough time, I  can learn several more.”</p>
<p>“That’s incredible!” Rebecca exclaimed. “How’d  you make the time to learn so many?”</p>
<p>“I had a Merovian as a teacher,” Riene answered  warmly. “It’s said they can understand every language in the  galaxy— maybe the universe. She taught me that every language is  easy to understand so long as I can grasp two concepts: one, it’s  not the words but the meaning; two, they all came from the same  source. Well, that was her theory, anyway.”</p>
<p>“What source would that be?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. It has a name I can’t interpret  well.” Riene shifted in her seat, adopting a more relaxed position.  “So what do you know about the Earth?”</p>
<p>“Just its official name in the Galactic Archives. I  know a little about its moon now. It’s hard to believe the Gaeans  have been in space for 600 years but only seriously explored it for  thirty.”</p>
<p>“We had plenty of distractions until then,” she  answered. “What about your people?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I think we came to New London about 200 years  ago and built the Marlin Colony. I think there were enough  environmentalists with them to keep most people away from the planet.  I guess it’s <em>possible</em> we came from Gaea…”</p>
<p>“Let’s leave all that to the scientists,” Riene  waved dismissively. She excused herself to use the bathroom, feeling  more content and more hopeful than she had felt in a long time. Riene  still felt anxious about returning home, of course, but she believed  she could face her family now with the strength she had developed  through adventuring. As she came out of the ladies’ room, she saw a  familiar streak of yellow and blue, and felt her heart leap as she  remembered an appointment she made. Of course! She had promised Sati  they would meet again on the Moon to discuss a possible future  together! With all that had been going on recently, Riene had almost  forgotten the arrangement, and now that it came to it, she wished she  had more time to prepare. But there was Sati, sniffing her out and  wrapping intimate arms around her waist. She kissed Riene on the  cheek and told her that her long wait had been worth all this.</p>
<p>“We should find someplace private to talk,” Riene  said. Sati offered her hotel room, which made Riene feel a little  uneasy (she remembered the last time they shared the same quarters),  but it was the best option at the time. If Rebecca should discover  them together, all the hard work she put into developing their  relationship would be ruined.</p>
<p>And yet Riene had so many things to tell Yeriman! They  had not seen each other since that night on the space station, when  Riene gave herself away and experienced sex for the first time. Back  then, she had been doubtful about herself and her feelings, and  Sati’s advances seemed like such a sure thing. She had been  infatuated with Rebecca but she feared the other woman would not have  anything to do with her, as every time they were together, she felt  ignored or invisible. It was like a heavy curtain had fallen between  them right from the start. Everything had changed after the incident  with her father, though, and now, even if they were not on good terms  yet, there was still a strong hope. Riene’s patience was finally  being rewarded, and so she had forgotten about her meeting with Sati,  until today, when the sweet young woman was staring at her, expecting  good news.</p>
<p>Of course she still felt something towards her, as  well. Sati was exactly the kind of person Riene had dreamed about  being with ever since she made the decision to leave Earth. Not only  was she strong of body, spirit, and will, but she was friendly and  warm, very pretty, and quite the lover (that had been her first time  as well). She could’ve made anybody happy, but she had chosen  Riene, because she fit her every wish and desire in a lover. The two  of them fit together naturally and might have been an incredible pair  but for the deeper, stronger, more stubborn desire that had been  rekindled in Riene’s heart. There was a good chance for her to be  with Rebecca now and she had to take it— but how could she break  Sati’s heart, especially after making love to her? And how long had  she been waiting here, anyway? Even if she had just arrived, a  rejection would wound her deeply; if she had been waiting for very  long, it would be devastating. Riene hated the position she was in  but knew there was no other way around it. First she wanted to gauge  just how badly she would hurt her dear friend.</p>
<p>“How long have you been here? We only just arrived;  we’re on our way to the Earth.”</p>
<p>“Uh, not too long,” she said, squirming a little in  her seat. “Long enough to justify reserving a hotel room. I had a  few adventures along the way here. You know, I actually didn’t  expect to see you for a few more days.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Were you prepared to stay very long?” Sati  grinned cutely and stuck her tongue out.</p>
<p>“I have three more days to go on my reservation, but  I was prepared to sleep in the <em>Kemosabe</em> if I had to stay  longer. It’s not nearly as nice as this place, but it’s free!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry I made you wait so long,” Riene  murmured as she turned pale. Just as she feared…</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it! It’s my fault for never  specifying an exact day. So how have you been?”</p>
<p>“Busy,” she exhaled with a traveler’s weariness,  “but also…very happy. And anxious.”</p>
<p>“Anxious?”</p>
<p>“I have family on Earth that I’m planning on  seeing. They’re not…bad people, just…well, I don’t think I  made them very pleased when I announced I wanted to go into space.”</p>
<p>“Were they against it?” Riene nodded.</p>
<p>“They’re sort of traditional in that regard,” she  answered delicately.</p>
<p>“Then why see them at all?” she wondered. Riene had  never asked herself that question, but had to face it now, and for a  minute, she thought her determination to “go through with it” was  fairly silly. But…</p>
<p>“They are my family,” she answered maturely, “and  I have to confront them. I have to show them exactly why I chose this  path.” She decided to change to a more congenial subject. “Let’s  see…what else have we done? We recently visited Pluto and Mars, and  before that…well, I didn’t go with them on very many adventures.  I was sort of wiped out by a conflict we ran into awhile back.”</p>
<p>“It’s good to take a break now and then,” Sati  answered warmly, scooting a little closer. “I’m actually on  vacation right now. What about Rebecca? Is she still with you all?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Becky’s here too. She’s been through a lot,  but I think she’s stronger now.”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? What happened?” Riene let the question  hang in the air as she adjusted her position.</p>
<p>“It’s not…my place to say. But she’ll be glad  to see you. She told me her Aunt Shandra’s going to the Marlin  Colony to visit her mother.”</p>
<p>“Oh, cool. Have you run into Kaori— I mean, Captain  Chuunaru?”</p>
<p>“No, not since we last saw you. Why, how is she?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know; that’s why I’m asking you. I  haven’t seen hide nor hair of her since that incident. Oh well, I’m  sure she’s doing just fine. Kaori’s a good friend, and she’s  very strong.” She beamed wonderfully and nudged so close that the  two women were touching. Sati held Riene’s hand and gave her an  irresistible stare. Riene faltered for a minute, because she knew  what that look was for and what Sati was expecting to hear. It took a  lot of willpower to discipline herself away from the doggish girl.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Am I coming on too strong?”</p>
<p>“No,” she smiled sadly, “you’re being very  considerate. It’s just… Do you remember the promise we made to  each other? That I’d tell you if I wanted to be your partner or not  when we met here?”</p>
<p>“I sure do,” she grinned. “That’s why I came  here. Do you have an answer?” Riene faltered for awhile as she  wrestled with her emotions. Sati was so good to her, so wonderful in  every way, and she was everything Riene could ever ask for. She was  as certain as the sky itself, and no doubt Riene would have a  wonderful life with her. Yet the time she spent consoling Rebecca  after the death of her father, holding her and healing her wounds,  came back to remind Riene why she was hesitating in the first place.  She loved Sati dearly, but the love she had for Rebecca…</p>
<p><em>Yes… I do believe I love her now.</em></p>
<p>“Yes,” she whispered respectfully. “And I’ve  decided to decline your offer. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Try as Sati Yeriman might, she could not mask the sorrow  she felt.</p>
<p>“Th-that’s okay,” she warbled. “I understand.  You must have found something even better…or you just don’t like  me… I mean, I don’t mean to sound insecure, but…oh… Well, I’m  sure you made the right choice, and…thank you for telling me  kindly. It must’ve been hard to…”</p>
<p>“Yes, I didn’t mean to hurt you, and I <em>do</em> like you, Sati, I really do. I was so close to jumping into your arms  and holding on tight…it really hurt a lot to let you down. And I  know I would have been happy with you, but…I need to be honest with  myself. As amazing as you are, there’s someone I love even deeper,  someone who…I’m sure needs me more than you do— and I know, as  great as you are, that there’s someone even better than me that you  deserve.” She winced as she realized how ineffective she sounded.  “That…isn’t much help, is it?”</p>
<p>“Not really,” she grinned sheepishly. “But you  mean well, and that’s…well, it’s something. And you know, maybe  there is still a good chance for me. I know what you mean by being  honest, too. Maybe…” She paused and held Riene’s hand shyly.  “Maybe this is for the best. I mean, let’s be frank here. You’re  gorgeous and intelligent, but…I don’t know if you could keep up  with me.”</p>
<p>“How very harsh!” Riene chuckled. “But I deserve  it, and it is true. Oh, Sati, thanks for understanding. I love you  too much to hurt you, but I <em>had</em> to— ”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” she smiled. “Uhh, just out of  curiosity, who’s the fair damsel that stole my place in your heart?  I mean, I won’t be jealous or anything, as long as she’s a good  person.”</p>
<p>“She is,” Riene answered— “the very best.”  Then, taking a deep breath and steeling herself, the blushing redhead  muttered, “It’s Rebecca.” There— she admitted it at last, and  it felt so good to have it out in the open. Sati, on the other hand,  was nearly bursting with joy: her ears stood up straight and her tail  waggled. Her teeth were bared and she bounced off the bed, clapping  and squealing with glee.</p>
<p>“Oh my god!! <em>Becky</em>? No WAY!! You mean you’ve  been in love with Rebecca Hill <em>all this time</em>?! THAT IS SO  AWESOME! Oh man— I don’t know what to say! I’m so happy, I’m  speechless!! You and Becky?! Wow! That’s…remarkable! I never  would’ve put you two together, but now that I think about it, you’d  be like…the perfect couple! Wow, yeah! You two would be <em>perfect</em> for each other!” She laughed for joy and gave Riene a big, loving  hug. “I’m sorry I got so upset! I wish I had known that sooner!  There’s no way I could be jealous now! Yeah! Go for it, girl!!”</p>
<p>“I’m happy you approve,” Riene chuckled, tears  streaming down her face. Sati kissed her cheek, but stood back  suspiciously as a thought came to mind.</p>
<p>“Heeeeey, wait a minute! If you’re in love with  Becky, why’d you agree to make love with me? Why string me along at  all?”</p>
<p>“It’s all very warped and complicated,” she  sighed tragically. “I’m sorry to say that I’ve been spineless  and doubtful for a long time. Rebecca was so awkward around me that I  felt she didn’t even want anything to do with me. I thought I could  get through to her, but every time we met, it was like there was a  barrier between us. Things got so hopeless that I actually considered  that offer you gave me. But…things have a way of changing. There’s  hope for us now.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Sati still sounded a little disappointed in  Riene, but at least she wasn’t nearly as angry. “I guess that’s  a good reason. Well shoot! Now I’ll have to live with all that! And  you only get one first time!”</p>
<p>“At least it was with someone I loved and trusted,  even if she wasn’t my first choice,” Riene attempted. “Most  people aren’t even that lucky.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right.” Sati tried to be strong and  managed a smile. It wasn’t her fault she got caught up in this  maelstrom. Artists wrote tragic operas based on these very themes; it  would be better for her to just move on, hoping for an even greater  outcome in the wake of this loss. She took Riene’s hands and stared  into her eyes with a fierce, protective love. “Anyway, please take  good care of Becky. I know you’ll both manage somehow; just don’t  give up. But if I hear you’ve hurt her in any way…then you’ll  have to answer to me.” Riene smiled warmly at Yeriman’s devotion.</p>
<p>“You really love her, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course! She’s a good friend. I mean it, now! I  want you to be good to her.”</p>
<p>“I will,” she swore, giving Sati another hug. “Why  don’t you say hello to her? I’m sure she’ll be happy to see  you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that would be great. Lead the way.” Sati’s  tail wagged for joy as she followed the redhead out of her hotel and  back into the commons lounge where Marsa was still going over the  details of her mission, and where a certain white-haired maiden was  still waiting. She gawked as Riene awkwardly rejoined her.</p>
<p>“What happened, did you fall in?”</p>
<p>“Um, no,” she blushed. “I ran into a mutual  friend of ours. I believe you two already know each other.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Thanks to the recent “distraction” caused by the  Jackal and Changera, the UCM had been forced to split its attention  and ask for the independently-owned <em>Dauntless</em> to intervene.  Further details were still pending, but those who worked for Origin  had reason to believe the Jackal had perished, good riddance, and  that the information at Ares and Phobos would not be theirs. They  were forced to bear this defeat as they sent the Dutchman out to  capture Ferocious— he was the only person that could— and return  him to face judgment. But it had taken somewhat longer than  anticipated to retrieve him. The demented cross-dresser had been  wandering around Silvanus stirring up trouble, killing  indiscriminately and leaving destruction in his wake, but rampaged in  failure. Ferocious was regarded as the galaxy’s second-best  assassin, but since he seemed incapable of snuffing two-dozen ladies  of mediocre skill, his reputation was put into question.</p>
<p>“You can’t pin anything on me, copper!” he cried  as he glared at a monitor. A pale, bluish-green holographic image  gazed back, its eyes drooping with solemnity and its mouth cold. This  was Boole, or the image he chose to reveal, anyway. “I was just  picking up some groceries! That tank just fell outta the sky! All I  wanted was some frickin’ noodles, man! You can’t expect me to  ignore big guns like that! Hahahaha…what the hell do you want, man?  Police brutality at its worst! JUST SOME FREAKIN’ NOODLES!!!  AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!!”</p>
<p>“Be silent,” the image commanded him sharply.  Long-dead emotions were stirring in Boole’s words and he took a  moment to compose himself. “You were absconded not for failure, but  because you acted rashly without instruction. Origin’s will goes so  far beyond the petty destruction of property and lives that I will no  longer dignify the matter with time and energy. Since you have proven  yourself incapable of executing the simplest tasks, whether by mental  deficiency or some unforeseen limitation, you must face a decision  regarding your position here.”</p>
<p>“Screw that!!” he roared in a fleeting moment of  sanity. “My teddy bears won’t play ball with your stuffed goose!  Papa goes where he wants and slices whatever doesn’t slice him  first! H-hey, doc, just gimme another chance, all right? NOODLES,  MAN— <em>NOODLES</em>!! COOK THEM AT 420 DEGREES AND MAKE SOME NICE  SPAGHETTI SOUP!! MARINATE IT ALL IN BLOOD!!  AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!!”</p>
<p>“Be <em>silent</em>,” Boole snapped, the image  glaring a hot red. “It is not my will but Origin’s you should  fear. If Origin believes you are still useful, you will be used. If  not, you will be cast out. Let him be brought before Origin.”</p>
<p>“W-wait! You mean the…b-big boss?!” Ferocious  squeaked in terror, and dug his heels into the ground. He didn’t  fear the Dutchman, Boole, the Fog Ninjas, or the multitude of  underlings that paid homage to their mysterious Head— nay, in fact,  a man with no sound mind cannot really fear anything of this world—  but Ferocious, insane as he was, feared Origin. This was an entity no  amount of madness could surpass. In fact, some said he became mad by  gazing at Origin only once. In spite of his screams and his protests,  Ferocious was dragged to the Throne, and though he could not see what  was perched there, he definitely felt the Presence, and cowered.</p>
<p>“Mercy!!!” he wailed, prostrating himself on the  ground. The room rumbled, and Ferocious squalled as an immense weight  pressed down upon him. Sensations too radical to put into words were  slipped into his mind, winding down to his miserable soul where they  racked and tortured him to oblivion and beyond. Inhuman howls came  out of his mouth, and he feared his body would be laid bare and  ripped apart. But he could tell from the relief he felt later that  Origin had spared him in the end and still believed him an asset.</p>
<p>“You have asked for mercy and have been granted it,”  Boole said flatly. “Be gracious and go away. You will be summoned  for a task soon enough. Hendrick, Captain Barbarossa, step forward.”  The immortal Flying Dutchman did as he was bidden, though he did not  fear the entity on the throne, and certainly felt no terror towards  the Face or the Madman. “You know of the <em>Dauntless</em>. Their  passage will take them to the world that birthed you, Hendrick. I  know you are far more suited to succeed than anyone else we could  ever persuade. Do not allow a single one of them to leave that  world.”</p>
<p>“And why should I return to familiar seas to spend  energy hunting women? Tis’ poor sport and poor use of my skills. I  seek dangerous prey.”</p>
<p>“They are Origin’s enemies. That should be  sufficient.”</p>
<p>“Origin’s enemies are not my enemies. Give me a  better reason for my actions.”</p>
<p>“There are those among them who have performed  dangers enough to stoke your ire, Hendrick. There is Yenae Marliir,  whom you know of, and several criminals of various degrees with her:  killers mostly, some with prices, others with knowledge too great to  keep. Professor Brignor must be spared only to be brought before  Origin for questioning in regards to Professor Hill’s work, and you  must also capture his daughter, who we believes holds a danger. Of  the others, you may do as you wish.”</p>
<p>“This woman you speak of, Captain Marliir— I have  heard of her deeds, as you say, and know her crimes. I shall see to  it that she has died, and if any of the others hold dangers I deem  worthy of my efforts, they too shall fall. But I am no dog for you to  control, vile engine, nor for Origin to judge. If your master has the  power to kill me, let them use it! Taunt me no further with your  promises. I have one last warning for you, villain, before I depart  for home. Let not that possessed wretch come within my sight. His  wickedness exceeds a century’s worth of evil, and but for his  madness, I would have taken his head. The next time I am called to  retrieve him, he shall arrive in pieces.”</p>
<p>Barbarossa stalked away with a majestic flair, the  floor trembling with every step. Boole had forsaken almost every tie  to his humanity ages ago, yet there was still anger, frustration, and  now concern— in small doses. He knew the Dutchman was stronger than  him, and if he so desired, could probably destroy him and maybe even  Origin. But for the promise of a release, a real chance at freedom  from his immortal curse, Hendrick van der Decken might have killed  them all. Yet Origin’s grand scheme depended on that very same  invulnerability— the ability to go anywhere, do anything, and kill  anybody, without tiring or stopping until the job was finished. So  long as he was inveigled properly, Barbarossa was a dangerous but  necessary tool.</p>
<p>As he parted, a stream of Fog Ninjas came to Boole and  offered him new information. No smile came to his face, but he  certainly felt an old stirring of pleasure. “The shape-shifter  lives. Remind her why she is working for us, and put her to use. She  is wearing out her welcome, but even a worn vehicle may still run. As  for that pirate, leave her alone for now. We owe her some peace for  slaying that traitorous jackal.”</p>
<p>Origin boomed.</p>
<p>“I understand, O my Fullness. Send word to Lord  Demise that the time is fast approaching. I will attempt another  transaction with the Ozmund siblings. You— continue monitoring the <em>Dauntless</em>. If even one of them escapes Hendrick’s pursuit,  use your full power to overwhelm them. They are not to leave that  world.”</p>
<p>The mist-creature bowed and drifted away to share the  orders to its loyal brethren.</p>
