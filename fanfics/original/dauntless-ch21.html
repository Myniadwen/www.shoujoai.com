<p>“Tomb  of the Panther, Part One: a pirate raid!”</p>
<p>“I  still can’t believe you of all people did that,” Athena murmured,  not without a grain of respect. She had invited herself to the  clinic shortly after Rose and her crew got settled in, and along with  Fuuka, was the first to interview Dr. Miracle about the events that  transpired not long ago. A small, rare smile creased her lips and  she unfolded her arms. “You never struck me as the type to perform  such a mindless stunt.”</p>
<p>“Try  ‘reckless’ stunt, dear,” Fujiwara said as she cured Amy’s  wounds. Aside from the obvious damage done to her foot when Miracle  put so much weight on it, there were also a few minor burns and bits  of shrapnel to deal with. Amy was flushed for inconveniencing the  good doctor with her battle-injuries, but she was also proud and  glowing from the aftermath of victory. Not even her foot could  totally eradicate that high sensation.</p>
<p>“I  know I don’t need to say this to you,” Fuuka pointed evenly, “but  you really should be more careful. Putting so much pressure on an  injury like that will only make it worse. I’m surprised you didn’t  even faint from blood loss—and thank goodness it’s not infected! Well,  the good news is that you’re otherwise healing quite nicely. It’s  remarkable how stubborn that one injury is, though. I’ve  been able to patch the rest up so well…”</p>
<p>“I’ve  heard this speech before,” Amy said, smiling very faintly. “You  really don’t need to worry so much, Fuji-san. I know the limits of  my own body quite well. What surprises <em>me</em> is that I was able to get away with so much.”</p>
<p>“Regardless,  be careful in the future. There—those bandages should hold you for  a few hours, and I’ve applied painkillers as well.” Amy thanked  her and reached for her cane, but she didn’t seem keen on  exercising more caution than necessary. Athena crossed her arms  again and hung her head; Fuuka could tell she was weighed down by  something. “Um, Theena-chan, what is it?”</p>
<p>“What  I don’t get is how she appeared so suddenly on the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>,  and how did you know that Rose’s group had their cannons rigged  like that?”</p>
<p>“You  need to start paying attention!” Amy giggled. “I just asked  Rachel to take me there. I wanted my words to reach everyone around  us, and I wanted to show those pirates that we could be strong too. As  for the cannons, well…” She trailed off quietly and stared at  the ground for so long that Athena became impatient.</p>
<p>“Yeah?” She raised her head as if coming from a dream; her eyes appeared  clouded.</p>
<p>“Huh? I’m sorry, what were we talking about? Anyway, I’m much better  now, so I think I’ll go say hello to Rose’s crew. You two should  come along as well.” She hobbled out casually, leaving the two  lovers to stare quizzically.</p>
<p>“Did  she just space out on us? Or is there a secret she just doesn’t  want to tell us?”</p>
<p>“It  must not be our business,” Fuuka sighed. “Ugh, secrets, crazy  girls, space pirates, galaxy police…this is just like the <em>Tenchi</em> series.”</p>
<p>“Does  that make me Ryo-ohki?” Athena said with a smirk.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p></p>
<p>At  first the Dead Roses were concerned that the <em>Dauntless</em> could not hold their entire company, and even if it could, there  would not be enough room for everyone to mingle about freely. But  somehow it all worked out; the ship seemed to expand and grow large  enough to accommodate them all, and with room to spare. What each  woman saw as she explored the vessel and familiarized herself with  its alien surroundings is unknown, nor should any discovery be  reported in the first place, for this was a vessel that showed one’s  innermost desires, and so “to each her own”. Several of Rose’s  girls were already becoming very familiar with their new allies—VERY  familiar.</p>
<p>Rose’s  helmswoman and main communications officer was a beautiful feminine  creature nicknamed Duchess, for she once led a life of nobility and  grandeur before the call of the wild regions summoned her. She  represented the population of the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> that Rose kidnapped or spirited away; she was in the habit of taking  wealthy, well to-do social elitists away from their homes and either  ransoming them off (if she didn’t like them) or seducing them into  her service. Duchess didn’t quite go through with this barbaric  process, though: she joined Rose of her own free will and was quite  happy to abandon her dreary, meaningless life.</p>
<p>The  chief technician aboard Rose’s ship was given the name Juniper at  birth, but everyone dubbed her “Torch”, due to her unnatural  penchant for carrying a blowtorch into battle (she and Kyrie hit it  off beautifully). Demented pyromania aside, Torch was fairly gifted  with technology and cobbling pieces of machinery together, and if it  weren’t for her fair skin (marked with its share of burn scars) and  yellowy hair, she would’ve easily passed as a Red. She didn’t  quite have Kyrie’s zeal, though, since her mind was fairly on the  level, and she preferred working on computers rather than the latest  gizmo. Even so, it was hard tearing her apart from lady Lastgear.</p>
<p>The  girl in charge of ammunition and firearms was a sweet, spunky,  carefree tomboy who was very easy to befriend, so long as everyone  got her name right. Her left leg was severed from the knee down, and  she had a machine gun grafted in its place, earning her the demeaning  nickname Peggy—short for “peg leg”. Those addressing her as  such were introduced to the business end of her legendary artificial  limb, but on the rare chance someone actually called her Henrietta,  she showered them with affection. She was a favorite sexual partner  aboard the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>,  but lately Henrietta had been gravitating towards Mink. Mink seemed  to enjoy the company, even though she still kept an emotionless mask  on.</p>
<p>There  were at least fifty other girls that Rose brought with her: mostly  runaways, former hostages, orphans, brothel girls, and the occasional  relative. Few of them had such outstanding quirks as Torch or  Henrietta; most could almost pass as normal women in regular society  (if it weren’t for the murder, theft, and indiscriminate sex they  all committed). There were two sisters onboard that, except for  their choice of outfit, fell into this broad category: Patches  Patty, who only wore eyepatches (usually three or four, depending on  how much she wanted to cover up), and Naked Natalie, who literally  spent most of her days in the nude (as Amy could attest, she even  fought in the buff). Chandra naturally befriended them very quickly.</p>
<p>Rose  herself spent most of her time engaged in strategy meetings with  Miracle, the Acheron sisters, and Rebecca Hill. She was obviously  drawn to the humble doctor and respected her as a commander and even  a rival, but it was clear she was totally smitten with Kayleigh and  Teleah, and made no effort to hide it. The Acheron sisters were used  to negative attention—growing up with a second head on your  shoulders was traumatizing, to say the least—so when Rose made a  pass at them, they didn’t know how to handle it. Only Chandra  bothered to flirt </p>
<p>with  them, but she had been programmed to; she had no other choice. Rose  carted around a whole harem of beautiful women, and yet her eyes were  focused on the pilots.</p>
<p>It  really wasn’t such an unusual thing once you put a bit of thought  into it. Physically, the twins were actually very attractive in  their own right, once you got over the fact that they were conjoined  so closely. They had an average height and weight for their age and  dyed their sunlit hair black and turquoise so that others could tell  them apart. Kayleigh, the black-haired one, was much more  soft-spoken, and between the two, was more recessive and submissive,  unless some problem forced her to lash out emotionally. She hated  crowds and insisted that the two spend most of their time isolated in  the cockpit controlling the ship’s movements, but she also didn’t  like being bossed around, even by her sister. She only followed Amy  out of respect—and because Miracle never forced her to do anything,  and never made any unreasonable request. She even had a crush on the  older woman, but was smart enough to know it could never work out.</p>
<p>Teleah  was definitely the verbose one, and everyone assumed her thoughts  were the thoughts of both girls. Unlike her sister, she didn’t  spare any words or feelings, and if somebody needed to be told  something, she would say it loud and clear. She loved being in the  middle of crowds and used to milk her “freakish” appearance for  all it was worth, even going so far as to consider joining a circus. If  there was a pun to be made about their looks, you can guarantee  she’d make it and laugh while doing it, which made Kayleigh  horribly uncomfortable every time. She would flip her long turquoise  hair proudly and throw as much of her weight around as she could  until she got her way, which made her a little unpopular. Rose  adored the sharp contrast and treated them as individuals, which is  the way they liked it.</p>
<p>“So  just how far away from New London are we?” she asked.</p>
<p>“It’s  some light-years away,” Kay sighed. Not even Bibliopolis had a  complete map of the entire known Milky Way; there were so many  discoveries and additions being made year round that it was  challenging and expensive just trying to keep up. Combining the  knowledge of everyone onboard, including the pirates, gave everyone  at the meeting a rough idea of how the galaxy was situated and where  everything was, but they couldn’t rely on accuracy.</p>
<p>“We’re  around this area,” Kay said, tracing a broad circle on the monitor  with a laser pointer. “These are the frontier areas. The Ozmund  Company has been trying to expand their enterprise in this region,  but their progress is slow. This is Saigrim, the last registered  planet we visited before running into your group. We outfitted the  ship <em>here</em>,  and the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> is <em>here</em>. Right now, we’re just outside the Grinma system. Alpha Centauri,  which is where New London is, is way…” She drew a long line that  almost dragged over a quarter of the known galaxy, until finally  resting on a spot close to the Helios system. “Over here. It’s a  long journey.”</p>
<p>“No  kidding,” Rebecca murmured. Her face paled and she nervously  played with her white hair: home had never seemed so far away  before. Somewhere on that planet’s satellite colony, her mother  was working hard to make ends meet, oblivious to the adventures her  daughter was having. It had been over two months since she left  home, but it seemed like days; the time passed quickly and she rarely  had time to rest and reflect on it all. “But there are plenty of  shortcuts if you know where to look for them,” she added. Rose  nodded and took the pointer for herself.</p>
<p>“Yeah,  the Bold Drive here, and the Ether Highway along this stretch. Some  of the less upstanding citizens of the world use the Pheriffa Net,  but that’ll take us close to a black hole and some asteroids, and  there’s also the Way of the Serpent if you don’t mind cozying up  to UCM Dreadnoughts.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I  was thinking we could use Shandra’s Curves,” Rebecca murmured. Rose gazed in bemusement.</p>
<p>“Kid,  I’ve flown from one side of this galaxy to the next, and I’ve  ridden on just about every shortcut and highway there is, but I’ve  never heard of Shandra’s Curves. I had a lover named Shandra once,  but she wasn’t what I’d call curvy.”</p>
<p>“No,  it’s there, trust me. It loops and swerves around a lot, and  sometimes the path changes, but it’s there. My aunt discovered  it.” Rose frowned gravely and shook her head.</p>
<p>“She  must’ve kept the secret for herself, cuz’ if it’s where you say  it is, I’ve never heard of it or seen a way into it. But if you’ll  swear on it…”</p>
<p>“I’ve  ridden through it before,” Rebecca said firmly. “Kay, Tee, you  think I could navigate you through it? I promise I know exactly what  I’m doing.” The twins were unsure, wanting to trust Rose’s  experience over Rebecca’s, but the young woman had such conviction  in her voice and eyes that they decided to believe her. Rose  shrugged and let out a deep breath.</p>
<p>“Let  it not be said I was afraid of uncharted waters. While these two  beauties are off setting the coordinates, why don’t you tell us  more about New London? I’m embarrassed to say I’ve never been  there.”</p>
<p>“It’s  not very special,” she murmured. “Most of it’s been overrun by  a jungle. There are a few small towns, but nothing that would really  register. There was a huge environmental disaster there a long time  ago, and the colonists put laws into effect that would protect what  was left. It’s done pretty well on its own, though, but we can’t  land there without special permission.”</p>
<p>“Since  when have I cared about getting permission?” Rose snickered. Rebecca stared at her grimly and shook her head.</p>
<p>“No,  you really need permission to land there or you <em>will</em> be shot down. All incoming traffic lands on the Marlin Colony, be  they peasant or emperor, and the ships are grounded until they’re  cleared for their next destination. In other words, you can’t  leave until the authorities know where you’re going next.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit!”</p>
<p>“It’s  true,” Rebecca answered. “The good news is that they’re fairly  lenient when it comes to letting people visit NL. People go there on  vacations or honeymoons all the time. It’s just that nobody will  allow any unauthorized visits. They really take those preservation  laws seriously.”</p>
<p>“Mother  fucker!” Rose exclaimed in shock. “Talk about being a  tight-assed hippie! So what if an honest upstanding criminal such as  myself makes the scene?” Rebecca shrugged.</p>
<p>“As  long as you don’t cause trouble while you’re on the colony, you  should be fine. Even a deranged butcher with a billion-gold bounty  could squeak through if he kept his nose clean.”</p>
<p>“We  should be fine,” Amy assured her. “After all, Rose, you’re my  guest. So once we make our way to New London, where do we go next?”</p>
<p>“Well,  if this map has any truth behind it, it’ll be buried deep on a  small isolated continent. From what Torch was able to decipher, it’s  protected by a chain of active volcanoes, some lakes infested with  all kinds of nameless monstrosities, and a primordial jungle teeming  with the unspoken horrors of a time long forgotten. It should be a  cakewalk.” Rebecca glared at Rose for a moment and shook her head. It  was nice hearing how fearless she was, but too much bravery could  be lethal. Fear was nature’s way of telling her children to beware  of danger, and those foolish enough to ignore the signs oftentimes  paid very dearly for their errors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Before  we all risk our lives for what may very well be a wild goose chase,  I’d like some time to visit my mother. I haven’t been keeping in  touch with her very often, and I’m a little worried.”</p>
<p>“We  probably should prepare ourselves for the task,” Amy added. “I  have faith that everyone will perform well, but we can’t just throw  ourselves at it. Let’s say…one day or two?”</p>
<p>“One  day is all I need,” Rebecca said. “And in the meantime, I’ll  be in the cockpit. Rose, please kindly refrain from seducing our  pilots, at least until we’re out of my aunt’s passage.”</p>
<p>“All  the best stuff is worth waiting for,” she replied smoothly.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Thanks  to the ingenuity of Rebecca’s aunt Shandra, for whom the secret  path was named, the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> made it to New London and the Marlin colony in just three days, as  opposed to the three weeks it would’ve taken them if they didn’t  use any of the shortcuts. Even with the fastest boosters and the  most powerful engines, traveling through the broad stretches of space  was time-consuming and tedious, so people took hyperspace or  Lennethium-drive shortcuts, and many of these were commercial lanes  used by the Ozmund Company. For those who wanted to hide from public  eyes, more dangerous routes became necessary, and sometimes, like in  Shandra’s case, they were stumbled upon quite accidentally. Vimmy’s species bought several and sold their traveling rights, but  unfortunately, this one was not for sale.</p>
<p>“A  pity, too, and so many people could benefit, why it’s one of the  fastest lanes I’ve seen, and it’s hardly dangerous, I wonder why  Miss Hill said her aunt wouldn’t take the money, it’s not like  it’s an issue with me, the investment would be practical and wise,  and I heard her family needs the money, urgh, why are humans so  stubborn and unpredictable, or else so greedy they’d make ME turn  colors, I can’t understand, but oh bother, where did that  confounded Mink go, it’s nearly lunchtime and I’m starved, I’ll  shrivel away to nothing if I’m not fed, do I have to rely on  Chandra now?”</p>
<p>Mink  had been slowly integrating herself into the crew ever since the  adventure on Bibliopolis, but since her tastes were so simple and her  emotions were so dulled, it was difficult making friends. She  positively fell in love with Shana, though, and spent most of her  time with the young artist, quietly looking over her work and  commenting on its beauty. Most Yuns have very little creativity and  can hardly make anything for themselves, except for the occasional  primitive tool, and they produce very little art, but they are  unmatched when it comes to appreciating the finer things in life.  Shana’s hobby was painting and sketching all the worlds she had  visited (and all the places her companions explored), and Mink’s  hobby was sitting and staring at these pieces. Henrietta was with  her, of course, and she fell hopelessly in love with Mink’s  pastime.</p>
<p>“It  looks just like the real thing,” she whispered as Mink pulled out  another easel. This one depicted Amazonia almost perfectly: you  could nearly hear the cry of birds, the roar of rivers, the breath of  wind, and the song of the mountains. The trees were so lush and  vibrant that Henrietta reached out to touch them, expecting to feel  rough bark and silky leaves. The majestic lizard king and the  saber-cats they had fought looked so realistic, she honestly expected  to touch fur and scales, not canvas.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“She’s  quite good,” Mink answered, her face clear and deep in thought. She  wasn’t smiling, but Henrietta could tell the taller woman was  overflowing with quiet, humble joy, and she snuggled a little closer  as the next piece was drawn out. Mink had a permanent scent of  wildflowers and honey-speckled clover about her, even in the middle  of this technological marvel, and her presence was as inviting and  warm as a blanket and hot cocoa on a winter’s night. Mink was so  beautiful and pure that it seemed blasphemous to think of her in a  sexual light, but Henrietta couldn’t help herself: she lingered as  much on Mink’s figure as she did on the art. But there was no way  she could make a move now: the moment felt sacred.</p>
<p>During  the three days it took to reach New London and its colony, Torch and  Kyrie also became close, but that was inevitable from the beginning.  The capricious Pyrosian seemed to have recovered from losing Vimmy  and soon became very friendly with the human—maybe <em>too</em> friendly at times; they nearly burnt down several rooms. Of course,  it was difficult when Torch wanted to take a bath or a shower with  her new friend, because all Pyrosians are averse to water, even when  it’s boiling hot (they usually wash themselves in oil), but Kyrie  was so excited to finally meet someone who shared her interest that  she made the ultimate sacrifice, and put up with it. The payoff was  worth it.</p>
<p>Not  even Duchess was immune to sexual desires, and was consumed with lust  whenever Allegra walked by. They were both ladies in the truest  sense of the word, and normally restrained themselves when it came to  that kind of passion, but for Allegra, it was considerably easier to  avoid her urges. She liked Duchess, but wasn’t even sure if she  could call her a friend: she was going through a rough phase where  her memories of the past decided to catch up with her. She only  seemed to relax whenever Kate was around, probably because she  believed the muscular woman could understand her pain, whereas  Duchess, who had basically led an easy life, could not. That  certainly didn’t stop her from trying.</p>
<p>“Great  breasts,” she grinned. Allegra rolled her eyes and scrambled away.</p>
<p>“Time  to leave the bath.”</p>
<p>“Great  posterior, too.”</p>
<p>“Kyrie’s  is better,” Torch said, drawing the poor waterlogged Red close.</p>
<p>Out  of all the pirates, Patty and Natalie received the most stares, but  they brought it upon themselves. They were perfectly at ease with  their bodies and were perfectly happy flaunting them, both to their  enemies and their comrades—and now to all these total strangers. Riene  was careful about where her eyes wandered whenever she was in  their vicinity, but she was only human; she stared too. Herut  decided to bunk them in the same category as Chandra (who naturally  hogged the sisters to herself for most of the voyage); Lyara gazed at  them with fondness, however, since they reminded her of some women  from her old gang.</p>
<p>“You  mean they ran around naked, or mostly naked anyway?” Patty grinned.</p>
<p>“No,”  Lyara murmured thoughtfully. “They were just…very close. Well,  they did dress provocatively, but they were also very sweet.”</p>
<p>“That’s  us all the way!” Natalie exclaimed. Lyara smiled faintly and  decided to go check on Rebecca. She felt guilty for using her  psychic powers to “spy” on other people’s feelings, but she had  developed an interest in the white-haired maiden and couldn’t  contain her curiosity any more.</p>
<p><em>She  has desire…and fear…and so much inquisitiveness. There’s hope  as well, and excitement, and apprehension. She’s awhirl with  thought and I know for a fact that I play a small part in that  maelstrom. But who else? I know she’s also thinking about her  mother, but there’s another person in her mind. It’s too bad I  can only read emotions and not thoughts.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Or  maybe it’s a good thing,” she said as she knocked on the cockpit  door. The Acheron sisters were alone, their thoughts centered on  making it through the shortcut and planetary customs, two voices in  perfect synchronization. It was very entrancing, but not what Lyara  was looking for. They told her she had just missed their navigator,  and that they would be arriving soon. Next time, perhaps.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Sometimes  it takes a kick in the teeth to make somebody change. For Rebecca,  she was forced to suddenly leave her home three years ago when she  was accused of attempted murder. Rebecca knew for a fact that she  was innocent: she had been going back home after a long shift at the  restaurant her mother worked at when she was approached by the  manager of a big company. He told her he could provide better  business opportunities for her if she would agree to be his wife, and  when Rebecca refused, things turned ugly and she was forced to defend  herself. The wound he received was not very serious, but it confined  him to a wheelchair and he put forth all his power to arrest her.  Rebecca knew that the court would side with whoever had the most  money and influence—after all, she was just some lowly waitress  going up against an important man—and so, with barely enough money  to eat off, she escaped her home in search of her destiny. Thinking  about this jarring event worried her, but she found support in an  unlikely place.</p>
<p>“What  an asshole,” Lil sighed as she escorted Rebecca onto the colony. “He deserved it. You should’ve blown his balls off, too. This  is proof that the human judiciary system doesn’t work.”</p>
<p>“I’ve  tried not to let it annoy me,” she sighed. “I’ve spent the  last three years trying to eke out a life for myself. Right now I’m  more worried about my mother than meeting up with that guy.” The  beautiful warrior-archaeologist placed a supportive hand on Rebecca’s  shoulder and grinned.</p>
<p>“That’s  the spirit! You humans do surprise me now and then. Your  independence and devotion is pretty admirable. I think I’d benefit  from your company.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t  you human?” she asked. Lil shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m  from the lost world of Mu, so I’m a Mun. That Dr. Fuuka calls me a  Mulian, but that’s just insulting. It’d be like if I called you  a shaved ape.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  but if you go around saying you’re a Mun, people will think you’re  just crazy. You do realize it’s pronounced exactly the same as <em>moon</em>,  as in ‘the moon of New London is a tiny rock’. And isn’t Mu a  fictional world anyway?”</p>
<p>“It’s  definitely real,” Lil snorted. “I almost died on that world. I  guess it doesn’t matter if you believe me, as long as Aseria does.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. So what sort of relationship do you two have? I know it’s sexual,  and you seem pretty close, but I get the feeling you don’t really  love each other.”</p>
<p>“She’s  a sexy, powerful woman I respect,” Lil shrugged as they leaned over  a railing. The city where Rebecca’s mother lived, Wayneport, was  typical as cities go, but it was smaller and the sky wasn’t as  cluttered with imposing buildings. It was the type of city that  could breathe easily and put people at ease—not amazing, but  certainly charming. Lillianne wasn’t impressed, but she didn’t  seem bored, either. “Aseria feels the same way towards me. I…guess </p>
<p>you  could say she cares about me, but I think the one she’s really in  love with is that psycho sister of hers. Erm, half-sister.” Rebecca made a face.</p>
<p>“She’s  in love with her sister? That’s a little disturbing.”</p>
<p>“Not  for a Sindar,” she replied coolly. “They practice incest and  homosexuality fairly often. I guess the species is ‘pure’ enough  to allow that sort of thing. It’s not like you humans never did  that—I know we Mun did that sort of thing all the time. My parents  were actually mother and son.”</p>
<p>“That  might explain something,” Rebecca grumbled. Lil just grinned and  drew Rebecca into an act of pseudo-affection.</p>
<p>“I  told you we’re cool with it. Hell, if they hadn’t chosen me as  their sacrificial maiden, I probably would’ve been engaged to my  little brother! But now I’ve said too much. I guess what I meant  to say is that I’m not really in <em>love</em> with Aseria, but I sure as hell like her, and I like being with her. I  trust her too, y’know? And sometimes trusting someone completely  is a whole lot better than loving them.”</p>
<p>“But  you act so possessive.”</p>
<p>“I  just hate seeing filthy lower species clawing at her with their  greasy hands. I’m cool with her fucking her dumb-ass sister. Hell, I’ve  fucked that bitch myself, and I hate her rotten guts! You know, if you  want, you could fuck me. You may be a human, but  you’re sure as hell gorgeous.”</p>
<p>“No  thanks,” she whispered darkly, prying herself out of Lil’s  embrace. “I think I’ll go visit my mother now. There’s her  restaurant. Thanks for taking me all this way.”</p>
<p>“Oh,  sure, no problem. You need me to wait out here?”</p>
<p>“That  would be nice. You’re a great bodyguard,” she grinned at last,  “but way too twisted for my taste. Later.”</p>
<p>“Sure,  bye.” Then, moping to herself, “But I <em>like</em> being twisted.”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Kaylee  Hill had a bounce to her step for once as she walked back to her  small home. Getting the occasional letter from her daughter was  nice, but nothing could compare to the real thing. She had tried not  to act too emotional as she hugged the young woman and studied her  face. If anything, her dear Rebecca was prettier and more outgoing  than ever, and it was clear she had improved in general as a  person—all those experiences and adventures had been good for her.  Kaylee had been sick with worry during that first year, especially  with that bounty on her daughter’s head, but now things had calmed  down and most people forgot about the incident. She herself had been  brought into the police station several times, along with her  sister-in-law Shandra, and they both vouched for Rebecca’s  character. The authorities were quick to point out that an innocent  person wouldn’t have run in the first place, but the cunning mother  responded by pointing out Rebecca had already been declared guilty by  the court; it was only a matter of performing a “trial”.</p>
<p>“At  least it’s mostly blown over,” she sighed as she unlocked her  front door. “There’s been several investigations and there’s  some new light being shed. At least Becky’s fine, and she seems to  have made some good friends. That lady that waited outside for her  seemed nice.” Kaylee wasn’t yet aware of Rebecca’s growing  attraction towards other women, but then again, </p>
<p>perhaps  even Rebecca herself was unaware of the development. As Kaylee  struggled to balance her luggage, her keys, and the door, someone  came up to her and offered to help.</p>
<p>“That  looks like quite a load. I’ve got a hand or two to spare; let me  help.”</p>
<p>“You’re  very kind,” Kaylee said as she handed a few bags over. She froze  quietly as she opened the door and got a good look at her helpful  assistant, and stood petrified as a flood of memories washed over  her—an entire history surging back into her mind.</p>
<p>“Hiya,”  said the other woman. “Long time no see.”</p>
<p>“It  has been awhile, Valti,” she mumbled softly. “I…I’m sorry,  do you want to come in?”</p>
<p>“Sure,  I can spare a few hours. How else are you gonna stock all this  food?”</p>
<p>“What  a surprise,” Kaylee said, sighing with relief and unexpected joy. “I didn’t think I’d see you again so quickly. I know you  couldn’t have escaped on good behavior alone…”</p>
<p>“Oh,  I know how to play politics,” Valti replied slyly. “Let’s just  say there were several contributors for my freedom. There’s still  a price on my head, of course, but it’s nothing big. You know,  that’s how I first met your daughter.” Kaylee grinned softly.</p>
<p>“I  hope she wasn’t too thoughtless or rough.”</p>
<p>“No,  she’s a great woman. You really raised her well. All this time,”  she grunted, stretching her eight limbs, “I figured we’d meet  eventually. The Hills and Professor Brignor are intertwined  together; it was only a matter of where, when, and what  circumstances. How are you holding up?”</p>
<p>“I’m  doing well, considering everything that’s happened. Becky and  Shandra help out whenever they can.”</p>
<p>“Oh,  really? I’m glad. Yeah, you’ve been through Hell and back,  haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“It’s  nothing,” she grinned. “You got the bad end of the bargain.”</p>
<p>“What,  these?” She flexed and flapped her extra arms, her face beaming  beautifully. “This is probably the best thing that’s happened to  me since I got my degree! I mean, sure, it hurt like hell, and it  was hard to adjust to at first, but the benefits outweigh the  drawbacks. And let me tell you, they’re <em>fantastic</em> for sex!”</p>
<p>“Still  the same old Valti,” Kaylee chuckled.</p>
<p>“I’m  not that old,” she coughed. “Remember, Kay, I’m only six years  Becky’s senior. If I wasn’t so uncomfortable with the idea, I  could be her girlfriend! Bwahahahahahahaaaa!!”</p>
<p>“Yes,  about that,” she blushed. “Do you…know anything? I’m afraid  you’ve spent more time with her recently than I have, and…she’s  never felt comfortable around men.”</p>
<p>“You  can’t blame the lady,” Valti sighed somberly. “She didn’t  have any good male role models. At least she remembers her daddy,  though. Would it really be so bad if you found out she liked girls?” Kaylee smiled warmly and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I  just want her to be happy and safe. So how long are you staying  here?”</p>
<p>“Not  long. I gotta hop on over to NL so I can keep an eye on that angel  of yours.”</p>
<p>“Why  are you going to New London? Taking a breather?”</p>
<p>“Nah,  I wish. We ran into Dead Rose the pirate, and after a few exciting  space battles, we called a truce and came over here to celebrate. I  think she knows where the Panther’s Tomb is.”</p>
<p>“So  does everyone else,” Kaylee chuckled.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I  dunno,” Valti shrugged, “she seems really certain. I’m more  worried about it existing in the first place than what we might find  in there.”</p>
<p>“I  know what you mean. So you won’t stay for long…” She smiled  sadly, rubbing her finger against her cup; Valti squealed and leaned  in close.</p>
<p>“Aww,  do you miss me already? Come on, admit it: you were happy when they  put me away!”</p>
<p>“I  most certainly was not! I cried. I was worried. I mean, I knew  you’d get out, but…it really scared me. And now that you’re  here, it all seems so unreal. It’s staggering.”</p>
<p>“You  want me to leave so you can rest?” Genuine concern and love  radiated out of Valti Brignor, and for that, Kaylee glowed with  gratitude.</p>
<p>“No,  please stay as long as you can. I get letters from Becky every now  and then, but this is the first time we’ve spoken in ages. Val…may  I ask one final serious question? It’s about Baker.” Valti  nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>“I  haven’t seen him since. My guess is that he’s up to his usual  mischief. Please don’t assume I’m any better than he is, Kay. There is no line that separates us. He experiments on humans,” she  groaned, lifting all her arms, “and I experiment on animals. Neither one of us ever keeps in touch with you. Hell, Baker wasn’t  even locked up. If anything, you should…”</p>
<p>Kaylee  leaned in and kissed her quietly. Valti agreed to stay for a little  while longer.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>True  to her word, Rebecca was ready to leave the next day, and in spite of  Rose’s doubts, the crew was given permission to visit New London. There  was tension and excitement everywhere: Kyrie and Torch held  hands and bounced with fiery happiness; Henrietta drew a little  closer to Mink and quietly held her arm; Rebecca felt stronger and  surer of herself after visiting with her mother, and Valti smiled  silently to herself. Her eyes were on the young white-haired maiden  she promised to watch over, and her thoughts drifted to the two  people she was connected to, and had loved deeper than words can say.</p>
<p>“Land  ho!” Duchess exclaimed. She winked at Allegra, who grumbled and  shouldered her rifle.</p>
<p>“Hi-ho  Silver.”</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of  next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Kyrie: Wheeeeee, I have a sexy new girlfriend! Yippee!!</p>
<p>Mink: So is there love in store for me as well?</p>
<p>Allegra: Hey, I dunno about y’all, but I am not succumbing to these wicked  Sapphic urges!</p>
<p>Kate:  (Darn!)</p>
<p>Kyrie:  In the next chapter, Torch and I cuddle! Yeeee! We snuggle! Heeheehee!  We wrestle each other in the nude! Squee! And, uh…oh  yeah, something about landing on a planet.</p>
<p>Mink: We arrive on New London and make our way to the Panther’s Tomb. Hmm, does it really exist?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Allegra: Who cares? I hear we get to fight the Fog Ninjas again! Yee-haw!! I can’t wait to let loose!</p>
<p>Kyrie: All this and more super happy Kyrie/Torch loving in the next  chapter, “Tomb of the Panther, Part Two: forbidden secrets await  our brave heroines!”</p>
<p>Mink: That’s a long title.</p>
<p>Allegra: I will admit your new girlfriend has good taste in weaponry!</p>
<p>Mink: Hmm. (faint smile)</p>
