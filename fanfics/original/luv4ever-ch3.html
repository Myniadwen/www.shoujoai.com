<p align="justify"><strong>Isabella&rsquo;s   POV</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   keep on pushing the man away from me but he&rsquo;s too strong for me. I   keep trying to scream as loud as I can and have only succeeded once,   and then I was being pushed roughly and land painfully on the hard ground   near a brick wall building. The man with black hair and dark skin (who   I tried to break free from) was grinning sickly at me. The other man   with blond hair just keeps on watching us, enjoying the <strong><em>&lsquo;fun&rsquo;</em></strong> while smoking his cigarette<strong><em>.   &lsquo;Oh god, why did I go out today?&rsquo;</em></strong> I asked myself silently,   regretting going out with my boyfriend tonight. <strong><em>&lsquo;Speaking of   boyfriend, where is Melvin?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought panicky. I pray that   he would come and rescue me now, but I realize that it will never happen   because&hellip;.he have disappeared&nbsp; in the night&hellip;.he left me alone!&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   have a slight flashback when I remembered that I couldn&rsquo;t find my   boyfriend and gave up. Then, I went to get a taxi to go home when suddenly;   someone grabbed me from behind and dragged me into a dark alley. I have   tried struggling to break free but the two men were too strong for me.   I became afraid and started to cry. I kept on hearing them saying what   they wanted to do with me and one of them started slapping me several   times on my face.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back   to the present time, I began to focus and I feel the blond haired man   pick me up roughly and hold my arms tightly from behind. I wince in   pain because his grip is so hard that I feel my arms getting numb instantly.   While the black haired man roughly squeeze both of my breasts and also   trying to unbutton my low-waist jeans. I try my luck to scream but no   voice comes out from my mouth. I start to cry and wish to just die now&hellip;.than   facing this torture <strong><em>&lsquo;again&rsquo;.   &lsquo;Why does this have to happen to me again?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought to   myself. Have I done anything wrong? What did I do to get this? I feel   tears falling from my eyes<strong><em>. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m so dead&hellip;.oh god, anyone   please help me!&rsquo;</em></strong> I pleaded silently in my heart, wishing that   someone will hear my plea as I close my eyes. I feel my jeans have been   removed from my legs forcefully and I can hear the man opening his trousers   and parting my legs widely. <strong><em>&lsquo;NO!&rsquo;</em></strong> I screamed in my   mind. Suddenly, I hear a fury scream from above. A scream...&hellip;of an   animal?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before   I try to open my eyes to see what is going on, I heard a horrible scream   behind me. I can feel strong feather wings brushing my head from behind.   I immediately open my eyes in surprise. A&hellip;..bird is helping me?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A   few seconds later, the blond haired man let go of me and I&rsquo;m free.   I hear him screaming in pain. I turn around and watch in horror when   I see an unusual large black and silver hawk, sinking its claws&rsquo; feet   deeply into the man&rsquo;s right shoulder; adding a scream of its own<strong><em>.   &lsquo;Ouch! That got to hurt!&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought in disgust yet awe at   the same time. Suddenly, I see the black haired man run to where the   hawk and his struggling friend is, trying to slash or stab the large   hawk with a knife. However, the large hawk suddenly let go of the blond-haired   man&rsquo;s shoulder that&rsquo;s now dripping with dark red blood and his black-haired   friend slash his badly injured shoulder instead. The blond haired man   screams in pain again. I did not pay attention to them; I just look   at the hawk as it flew above us and suddenly starting to&hellip;.shape shift?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m   shock and suddenly realize that this&hellip;.person must be one of the protectors   of this city. I immediately feel grateful to this person yet curious;   thinking who my saviour is. I look at the hawk turning into a human&hellip;.with   large black wings. I can&rsquo;t see his face clearly because the alley   is really dark&hellip;..but something about him got my attention. I gasp   when I see his glowing silver eyes&hellip;or to be precise&hellip;.her glowing   silver eyes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>&lsquo;No,   don&rsquo;t tell me it&rsquo;s her&hellip;.not now,&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought in horror.   I watch her flying down and have landed on the ground with a grace of   a feral. Her large black wings are spread wide, showing the danger of   herself. I see her eyes&hellip;..that show full of rage just like I first   saw it a year ago. She then walk towards the two men (who are trying   to compose themselves to fight back) like a predator stalking its prey.   I back away further and sit right near the corner of the wall and watch   her fighting the two men with incredible speed. A few seconds later,   both of the men have dropped unconsciously on the ground and she just   stand there looking at them&hellip;.like they are just puppets to her. I   gulp nervously, realizing that it&rsquo;s only me and her now. <strong><em>&lsquo;Oh   god!&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought with fear as she slowly turn around and look   at me with her glowing silver eyes. There is only one word that escapes   from my mouth as I look at her.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">*******************&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   wanted to scream all my might and run away from her, but I just sit   near the wall looking at my former best friend with fear. I see the   rage in her eyes starting to fade and it is replaced with concern and   gentleness and&hellip;.love? I feel confused&hellip;.she&rsquo;s so mysterious. She   didn&rsquo;t even move towards me yet I&rsquo;m grateful that she&rsquo;s trying   to give me space. With this advantage, I look at her&hellip;.studying her   from head to toe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;s   wearing a black turtleneck that shows her every curves of her figure.   I start feeling myself licking my lips as I look lower and lower. She   also wears black boot-cut slacks with black boots. With her large black   wings behind her, she looks like an angel&hellip;.a dark angel. She&rsquo;s a   magnificent creature as her black and silver hair was blown softly to   her fair face and her soft silver eyes looking at me. I had always loved   her eyes when we have started being friends four years ago because it   had always brought me comfort and love. At once, I feel my body waking   up like it never have before&hellip;.feeling the warmness and desire spreading   inside my body, craving hers. Wait?! Desire?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   shook my head<strong><em>. &lsquo;No, she&rsquo;s doing this! I just   knew it! I have a boyfriend for god sake! I can&rsquo;t fall for her&hellip;ever!&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought to myself yet I find myself hesitating; and I look at her   again. Then, she starts to walk towards me, holding something in her   right hand and I start to tremble with fear. I even try to back up against   the hard brick wall, wishing that it would swallow me up now but it   never happen. I have nowhere to go and so I look at her again with all   the fear that I have for her.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>&lsquo;Why   do I fear you so much?&rsquo;</em></strong> I asked myself silently. I know that   I&rsquo;m not afraid of her when I found out who she really was or that   she would harm me or else. <strong><em>&lsquo;Then why am I afraid of you?&rsquo; </em></strong> I asked myself again silently as I look deeply into her eyes and see   a mixture of concern and&hellip;.love&hellip;for me. And I realize that I know   the answer to my question.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m   afraid of you claiming me.&rsquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">*********************&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elila   kneel down in front of me and give my jeans to me. I look at it blankly   at first and realize that I&rsquo;m not wearing anything from my lower part   of body except panties. I take it and quickly wear it as I look at her.   She just stare at me waiting for me to finish putting my jeans on. After   I finish wearing my jeans, she slowly touches my left bruise cheek.   I hear her cursing herself softly as she stared at me with full of sadness.   No matter how much I fear her, I always find myself being safe around   her because she always have a need to protect me since we first met.   How she would always volunteered to walk me home before she goes home.   How she would call me every night to see that I&rsquo;m all right. How she   catches rabbits for me in the park just to let me touch its soft fur   when we have our picnic or a walk. Oh, how I miss those times&hellip;&hellip;so   many beautiful memories. But sadly, no matter how much I want us to   be friends again yet I know it will never be the same again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   realize that she is still touching my left cheek softly. When she touches,   I did not feel pain but comfort&hellip;however I did not want this to continue   further so I said to her softly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She   stops touching my cheek and looks at me blankly yet hurt. I said to   her softly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t   do this if you want me now.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   feel like a complete fool to say that but I just can&rsquo;t help it. She   withdrew her hand slowly from my left cheek and takes a deep breath.   She said to me gently.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m   not&hellip;you know.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Going   to claim you&hellip;..now.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   stare at her; trying not to believe her but I see hurt in her eyes yet   the truth is there. Then I hear her saying to me slowly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Isabella,   allow me&hellip;.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   feel my heart beating loudly as I wait for her to finish her sentence.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;&hellip;..to   heal you completely, please?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   did not answer her immediately but just stare at her. I have remembered   her asking me the same question a year ago in our principal&rsquo;s office.   She looks at me with sadness, saying that it hurts her so much to see   me like this. My heart feels so heavy because of her concern for me.   So I just nod at her and she smiles gratefully as she slowly touches   my arms that also have bruises.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   look at her as she closes her eyes. I feel the familiar warmness of   the healing on my bruises, growing in me slowly. After for quite sometime,   she moves her hand from my arms to both of my cheeks that have bruises   on it. I close my eyes, loving the warmness and feel myself surrendering   to it. And then, the healing is complete and I open my eyes. I suddenly   watch her backing away from me, putting enough distance between us as   she starts struggling&hellip;holding herself. I watch her body tense and   her eyes are filled with desire. I realize that she&rsquo;s controlling   her need to claim me. I feel somehow amazed as I just sit there looking   at her yet I feel myself responding to her again&hellip;..feeling the need   to be close to her body, the need to be claim by her. When I have realized   what I was feeling for her, I gasp in horror and firmly put the desire   aside completely...I think.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Isabella,   are you all right?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   look up at her and she looks calm. I guess she have succeeded controlling   her desire for me. I stand up slowly and feel in a need to go home now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yeah,   I&rsquo;m okay. I think I need to go home now.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   walk pass her to get out from this dark alley but I find her using her   speed and she&rsquo;s in front of me again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Let me   send you home, little belle.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   look at her who is now a few inches away from me as my thoughts are   busy looking at her slightly pinkish lips<strong><em>.   &lsquo;Hmm&hellip;.wonder what it feels like to just&hellip;..no!! I&rsquo;m not supposed   to think like that! Focus!&rsquo; </em></strong> I thought angrily. Then I hear her asking me seriously.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re   with Melvin, aren&rsquo;t you? Where is he?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Huh&hellip;.what?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><em>&lsquo;Wait,   how did she know about Melvin?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought as I feel a pang   of jealousy in me. Jealousy? Where did that come from?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Melvin   is my 2</strong><strong>nd</strong><strong> cousin. He&rsquo;s with you tonight.   I can smell him on you.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   start to tense up. <strong><em>&lsquo;No wonder he disappeared,&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought   yet I still felt angry at the fact that he left me all alone.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;He went&hellip;.somewhere.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   hear her starting to curse under her breath&hellip;.making sure that I will   not hear her. Her eyes start to glow with anger but soon fade immediately;   when she sees me looking at her with fear. She shook her head and takes   my right hand with hers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Let me   send you home, all right?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   just nod my head to her, thinking it is best to avoid the subject about   Melvin. She pulls me closer to her and holds me with protectiveness   yet gentle. I can also feel her hot breath on my forehead. She then   went to my left ear and whispers to me huskily.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Turn   around.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Do you   trust me little belle?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   keep quiet for awhile, not trusting my voice at first. Then, I feel   a sudden comfort in my mind and I know she&rsquo;s giving me comfort for   my fears. I start to relax.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Then   turn around.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   turn around and she pulls my body from behind gently towards hers. The   minute my back touches her front body; I feel my body growing hot with   desire. I feel my legs starting to buck and getting weak. I moan loudly   and feel my centre throbbing painfully. <strong><em>&lsquo;Oh god! This feels   so good!&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought and also thinking if this is how true   mates respond to each other.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Isabella,   are you all right?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   hear her voice feeling with concern but before I realize what I was   doing, I boldly pushing my body tightly to hers, increasing the contact.   I feel her body tense up and her breathing becomes sharp and short.   I then turn my head sideways and nuzzle her neck. I answered her with   full of desire.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes Elila.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   start kissing her neck erotically, loving the softness of her fair skin.   I lick and nibble her neck as I start rubbing her body with my back.   As for Elila, I think she&rsquo;s trying to stop me but the feeling is too   great to resist. She did not dare to do anything to me but moan and   panting heavily. Her black wings suddenly covered me&hellip;or us to be exact,   not letting anyone to look at this erotic view. I feel her hands holding   my waist, trying to balance herself and somehow allowing me to explore   her&hellip;.the future mate. But I hear her plea softly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Isabella,   stop. You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   hear her plea but my desire is too great to just stop now. I quickly   turn around and push her forcefully to a nearest wall. I did not know   why I have this bold feeling. I have never made love nor have sex with   anyone. Even with Melvin, who is my first boyfriend&hellip;I never dare to   give myself to him. Yet this feeling is alarmingly strong that I feel   like I&rsquo;m going to explode. Elila&rsquo;s wings are still covering us and   I can feel her controlling her need to claim me. I feel myself rubbing   her body with mine again and our nipples starts to harden. She still   holds my waist and I play with her breasts, pinching her nipples and   love to hear her moan. I still keep on nibbling and kissing neck and   one of my hands leaves her breasts and went down lower and lower; until   I start rubbing her centre that is still frustratingly covered with   her slacks. <strong><em>&lsquo;God, this feels so good!&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought lustfully.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Isabella,   stop please.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   hear her saying that again and again but I just can&rsquo;t help myself.   She just tastes and feels so good&hellip;..And suddenly, I hear her voice   in my mind. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   instantly stop and start breathing hard. I see her face flush from the   things that I did to her. I also see her white fangs as she look at   me, breathing heavily. I back away slowly completely realize what I   have done. <strong><em>&lsquo;Oh god, what have I done?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought in   panic. First, I&rsquo;m afraid of her that she would to this to me and now   I&rsquo;m doing it to her? I apologize to her and quickly turn to run away   but she quickly holds me on my waist from behind.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Shh,   it&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;ll send you home now.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   turn and look at her blankly. I&rsquo;m shock that she still has the heart   to forgive me after I use her for my desires? But she just smiles at   me, knowing what I&rsquo;m thinking. <strong><em>&lsquo;Heck, she&rsquo;s a telepathic&hellip;of   course she knows what I&rsquo;m thinking,&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought stupidly   but somehow I feel that she won&rsquo;t read my thoughts without my permission.   She silently carries me without a struggle and I automatically put my   arms around her. She smiles at me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Trust   me?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   just nod at her.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She   smiles and starts spreading her large black wings. Her wings start to   flap and it creates a wind under those strong feather wings. I feel   that both of us are not on the ground and realize that we are not at   the dark alley anymore&hellip;. I realize that we are on the sky and I watch   in awe at the beautiful city below me. I hear Elila&rsquo;s soft laugh;   please that I love the beautiful view below me as she starts to fly   to the direction that is to my home. She holds me protectively to her   so I will never fall from her strong grip&hellip;. I'm somehow grateful that   she forgives me yet I still want to know something.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She   looks at me with gentleness.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Ermmm&hellip;are   we&hellip;.?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She   smiles at me yet I can see sadness in her eyes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Officially   mates? No&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   feel relief but still feel guilty about the whole things in the dark   alley.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Oh&hellip;.   I'm sorry Elila&hellip;I really am&hellip;.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s   all right.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All   the tense in my body starts to go away as I relax on her strong grip.   I feel the wind blowing through my face when I hear her saying something   to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;You said   something Elila?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She   nods her head at me and whispers to me&hellip;enough to make me hear.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;May I   have a request little belle?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   just smile at her.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Sure.   What is it?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Your   friendship again.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   feel myself smiling more and more.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d   love that Elila."</strong>&nbsp;</p>
