<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/rivrage-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&#147;Breathing...spirit...discipline...&#148;

A cool breeze ran through the disjointed training rooms that Ayane 
Yosukube trained in. Unlike the other members of the SBA, who trained 
at the Gyms of Tomeishuu, Ayane left the school entirely to train. 
However her actions were not to improve her fighting ability. Not 
today. Right now, Ayane needed a place to relax herself and more 
importantly, clear her mind. 

It had been nearly one whole day since Natsumi had admitted that she 
and Minato Ikatsuji were seeing each other romantically. And in turn, 
Ayane discovered about the relationship between Rinako and Keiji Aoba. 

The shock that Ayane felt was...unparalleled. Never before had she 
heard of this...Keiji Aoba. From what Izumi had told her, Rinako had 
been seeing him for around four to five months. Not only that, but 
Izumi&#146;s sources told her that Keiji was planning to take their 
relationship up to a new level.

By presenting Rinako with a commitment ring.

Once again, Ayane lost her concentration. Why couldn&#146;t she focus? 
Meditation was something that allowed Ayane to reach an inner moment 
of peace and tranquillity. Yet all she could think about was Rinako 
and Keiji...together.

{What is wrong with me?} Ayane thought. {I...I accepted the choice I 
made. I am paying for it everyday. But...does it still haunt me? Why 
have I not moved on...? Why do I still...?}

Ayane tried not to let her thoughts get away from her. Or at least 
from where she wanted them to be. Though it had been a long while 
since...those days, Ayane could not stop thinking about them. Because 
back then, she could at least say that she was happy. But between then 
and today, there was only one difference. And that difference was the 
nature of her problem. For a while, Ayane thought she had accepted the 
consequences of her actions. Even though the situation was out of her 
hands, the SBA leader knew she could have at least attempted to 
prevent it. But, her feelings denied her that choice. In addition to 
willingness to avoid something that would eventually take her over. 
Much to Ayane&#146;s mistake, it already did. 

It was possible that these things made the fighting between the Cross 
Blade Lancers and the Spring Breeze Assassins so much more fierce. 
Ayane remembered Izumi telling her that the battle were never as 
hectic before she took over control of the SBA. The rivalry between 
the two gangs was heightened when its two leaders had their own 
personal vendetta.   

Ayane&#146;s past was confusion to her, and at the same time, it was clear 
as day. Maybe because her memories were intertwined with another. 
Another fighter who possessed Rai shou en ken skills.

Rinako.

**********

Strident bangs of feet and fists connecting with a heavy bag boomed 
around the private training grounds of Rinako. It was her usual place, 
the small abandoned gym just behind Tomeishuu High. Like most solitary 
fighters, Rinako came to her personal dojo for one of two reasons. One 
would be to improve her fighting ability. The other would be to work 
off her stress. 

For Rinako, it was the latter.

Things had just piled and piled on her for the past few days. Not only 
was she getting flack from Principal Yagami, but also she was late for 
her class yesterday. Which meant weekend detention. Izumi had gotten 
her last laugh at Rinako, and smugly, she wasn&#146;t ashamed of her 
constant heckling of Mishizu. The dual of control was coming up soon, 
even though Rinako didn&#146;t feel up to fighting Ayane right now. And 
worse of all, Minato had gotten herself involved with Natsumi. 

That was the big hitter. Minato.

Rinako could not believe that her innocent baby sister would go behind 
her back the way she did. And of all people to do that with, it had to 
be a friend of Ayane&#146;s. It seemed like whatever she did, Rinako 
couldn&#146;t relieve herself of that woman&#146;s influence. 

But what made it worse was that Rinako was feeling a little guilty 
about ordering Minato to stay away from Natsumi. All Rinako wanted was 
for her sister to be happy. And she just could not picture Minato&#146;s 
happiness with a Spring Breeze Assassin. Anyone or anything that was 
within the Spring Breeze Assassins was an extension of Ayane. That 
made all of it Rinako&#146;s enemy. Rinako did not want Minato to fall into 
that category. On the bright side, she was going out with Keiji later 
on. He told Rinako the a few days earlier that he had something 
important to give to her. That was enough to keep Rinako from doing 
something drastic. Keiji always did know how to calm her down. 

On the other side of the echoing gym was Mishizu. She had just walked 
in. The expression on her face indicated her worry. Mishizu heard 
about Rinako&#146;s altercation with Natsumi, but didn&#146;t have the details. 
The worry of Mishizu prevented her from seeing the obvious scenario 
though. 

Mishizu decided to make her presence known. &#147;Problems?&#148;

Rinako looked across from her to the one who called on her. It was 
Mishizu. The CBL leader smiled timidly. &#147;You could say that. I need 
some cheering up though.&#148;

Mishizu smiled a little. &#147;Anything I could help with?&#148;

Despite her predicament, Rinako let herself chuckle a little. &#147;Nah. I 
doubt it.&#148;

A silence fell on the two. Mishizu didn&#146;t like that. It felt awkward 
between them, and that only meant one thing. It meant that Rinako was 
really caught up with something.

&#147;So...&#148; Mishizu began. &#147;Why are you so stressed out?&#148;

Rinako looked away from her close friend. &#147;...You wouldn&#146;t believe me 
if I told you, Mishi.&#148;

&#147;Does it have something to do with Natsumi?&#148;

Rinako&#146;s honey brown eyes darted back to Mishizu. &#147;Huh? How do you 
know about that?&#148;

&#147;Work gets out fast, Rinako. Some of the other girls told me that you 
had words with her. But nobody knows what it was about.&#148;

The older Ikatsuji sister wore an ironic frown, and thrust her fist 
back into the dense fabric of the heavy bag. &#147;Is that why you&#146;re here? 
To figure it out?&#148; 

&#147;No.&#148; Mishizu said. &#147;I am here because I&#146;m worried about you, Rinako.&#148;

Rinako stopped punching the heavy bag. Through all the confusion of 
the Minato thing, she was starting to forget whom her allies and 
friends really here. Sweet little Mishizu was only trying to help; and 
here was Rinako, accusing her of all sorts. 

A sigh escaped from Rinako. &#147;Mishizu...&#148;

Then a smile returned to the diamond-eyed student. &#147;You should watch 
your anger sometimes, you know.&#148;

The tense lock on Rinako faded as she slowly stepped away from the 
heavy bag. &#147;Oh, Mishi. Come here a sec, will ya?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Just get over here!&#148; Rinako shouted playfully.

Mishizu quickly walked over to her friend, and before she knew it, 
Rinako&#146;s lightly tanned arms were wrapped caringly around her. Though 
Mishizu was shocked, she returned that hug. It was a simple act of 
friendship to Rinako, but to Mishizu it meant everything. Be able to 
hold Rinako in her arms.

Rinako pulled back and Mishizu reluctantly released Rinako from her 
embrace. &#147;I&#146;m sorry for being such a misery. You&#146;re always looking out 
for me, Mishi. If it seems like I&#146;ve been...ignoring you or avoiding 
you, I&#146;m not doing it on purpose. I&#146;ve been wrapped up in myself just 
a bit too much these days.&#148; 

&#147;I know that, Rinako.&#148;

The purple-haired student smiled a little more. &#147;You&#146;re my best 
friend. I know you&#146;ll always be there for me.&#148;

&#147;Of course I will. But you shouldn&#146;t worry about me. I am a little 
more worried about you. Why were you talking with Yakume?&#148;

Rinako scowled when she pictured Natsumi and Minato together. &#147;...The 
Yakume girl is...well she was, in a relationship with Minato. That 
oily snake had her hooks into my sister...&#148;

Mishizu blinked. &#147;You...you know about that?&#148;

&#147;Well yeah.&#148; Then Rinako&#146;s mind became abrupt with a certain thought. 
&#147;Wait...are you saying that...you knew all along?&#148;

The diamond eyes of Mishizu could not meet Rinako&#146;s. &#147;Rinako...I...&#148;

Instantly the caring in Rinako&#146;s eyes disappeared. &#147;You knew about 
Minato and the SBA girl and you didn&#146;t tell me?!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, Rinako...but Minato was so happy. If you would have seen 
her face when she spoke of Natsumi, you would have done the same.&#148;

&#147;Oh I&#146;m pretty sure I wouldn&#146;t have. And you shouldn&#146;t have either!&#148;

&#147;Why not?&#148; Mishizu asked. &#147;Don&#146;t you want her to be happy?&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t tell me that crap about my sister! I know what&#146;s best for her, 
and that girl is not it! I can&#146;t believe you! You&#146;re supposed to be my 
best friend! If something like this were happening with your sister, I 
would have told you about it straight away! How can you backstab me 
like this?&#148;  

&#147;Backstab? Rinako, I didn&#146;t-&#147;

Rinako stepped away from Mishizu. &#147;Save it, Mishizu! I can&#146;t believe I 
defended you when Izumi started her freaky tricks again...I thought I 
knew you better than anyone, but it turns out that Izumi was right...I 
don&#146;t know you at all...&#148;

Mishizu tried her hardest not to leak any tears. She should have known 
that Izumi would have said something, but that was not what was 
getting to the aquamarine-haired schoolgirl. It was Rinako&#146;s 
accusations...

Mishizu&#146;s voice deteriorated into a whisper. &#147;...Rinako...&#148;  

Instead of addressing this, Rinako simple looked away from Mishizu. 
She felt like everywhere she turned, someone was dropping bombshells 
to cause her more pain. &#147;I need some space. Just leave me alone.&#148;

Ask. Beg. Plea. Whatever it took. Anything was acceptable to Mishizu 
except for Rinako&#146;s disappointment. Mishizu couldn&#146;t stand the thought 
of Rinako being upset with her. But it was out of her hands. After 
taking one last look at her heart&#146;s desire, Mishizu walked over to the 
entrance doorway and left. 

Rinako gave Mishizu no second thoughts as she went back to her assault 
on the heavy bag before her. Things just couldn&#146;t get any better.

**********

{...Natsumi...}

Minato idly flicked page after page of her English textbook. She was 
in her room, lying stomach first on her bed She was also supposed to 
be studying for a big test next week, but right now, the blonde girl 
couldn&#146;t really focus on it. Minato&#146;s thoughts were trained on Natsumi 
and Rinako. 

Never before had Minato see her sister become so angry over her choice 
in partners. Of course, Rinako never liked *anyone* who got close to 
Minato, she was a very typical over-protective sibling. But it was 
worse for Natsumi for some reason. Couldn&#146;t Rinako understand that she 
was in love? Why did she have to act the way she had been doing so 
far?

Minato flicked another page absently. {Why is she acting like this? I 
know that this is more than just Rinako being over-protective of me. 
And...for some reason...I think it has something to do with Ayane...}

Then, just when Minato felt like she was verging on something, her 
cell phone started ringing. Not that she was in the mood to talk to 
anyone, but the younger Ikatsuji sister answered the call anyway.

Minato held it up to her ear and spoke. &#147;Hello?&#148;

A familiar voice piped up. &#147;Hiya, Mina-chan.&#148;

Minato&#146;s eyes went wide. &#147;Natsumi? Oh I&#146;m so glad to speak to you! 
Where are you calling me from?&#148;

&#147;Outside the school. From a payphone. Look, I can&#146;t stop long but...I 
just needed to know how you were.&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m fine, Natsumi.&#148; Minato said in earnest. &#147;Rinako was pretty angry 
before but she&#146;s calmed down a little. I think she&#146;ll be fine in a few 
days time. Sis always bounces back.&#148;

&#147;I get the feeling that this is a little more serious then that, 
honey. Just promise me that you wont stop trying, Minato.&#148;

&#147;Of course, Natsumi. I love you. I won&#146;t give up.&#148;

Minato could almost hear Natsumi smiling. &#147;That&#146;s good, Mina-chan. 
I&#146;ll take you on the greatest date of your life once all of this blows 
over okay?&#148;

A blush popped up on Minato fair cheeks. &#147;I can&#146;t wait...for that.&#148; 

&#147;It&#146;ll be soon, I promise. I&#146;ve gotta go, Mina-chan. Bye.&#148;

&#147;Bye.&#148; Natsumi hung up. Though she was happy to hear from Natsumi, she 
couldn&#146;t stand the way things were right now. Something had to be 
done. 

**********

&#147;What&#146;s up, Rinako?&#148;

Keiji Aoba stared curiously at his girlfriend. Ever since their date 
had started, Rinako had been in a world of her own. He couldn&#146;t 
explain it and Rinako was in no hurry to explain herself to him. Even 
so, Keiji was beginning to worry. Not just because of Rinako&#146;s 
dejection, because he was going to spring his &#145;important surprise&#146; on 
her. It was around 10.00 at night and the two were currently at a 
small caf&eacute; just within Roppongi. Rinako really didn&#146;t care for 
foreigners but this place did have good service. That was worth 
something. The real problem for Rinako was her life inside of school. 
Everything was on top of her. Leadership, Mishizu, Minato...Ayane. All 
of it was bearing a heavy weight on Rinako. So much so that she was 
attacking the people who were closest to her. She shuddered to think 
how Mishizu was right about now. Mishizu always took things to heart. 
If you didn&#146;t put her at ease as soon as possible she could sink into 
mild depression. 

{Why did I get so angry with Mishizu?} Thought Rinako. {She was only 
looking out for Minato; I guess...I hope she&#146;s okay...}

&#147;Rinako!&#148; Keiji yelled, muffling his voice enough so that the 
surrounding tables were not disturbed. It was sufficient to pull 
Rinako away from herself.

&#147;Huh? Oh...sorry, Keiji.&#148; Rinako&#146;s apology wasn&#146;t exactly award 
winning, but it was enough. 

Keiji smiled. &#147;That&#146;s okay. You looked pretty bagged. Hard schoolwork 
nights or what?&#148;

Rinako sniggered grimly. &#147;Yeah. I suppose you can look at it like 
that. What about you? You look pretty tired yourself.&#148;

&#147;Not really.&#148; Keiji started tapping his fingers absently. &#147;I do work a 
lot at the shop though. But I feel better about it knowing that I&#146;ll 
see you eventually, Rinako.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re too nice, Keiji. I&#146;ve always said that. Why...do you even 
bother with me? I&#146;m always in a bad mood and we barely see each other 
a fortnight.&#148;

Before his auburn-eyed girl could continue, Keiji placed his hand on 
Rinako&#146;s smaller one and squeezed gently. &#147;Don&#146;t ever start thinking 
like that, Rinako. I would do anything I could for you and I wouldn&#146;t 
hesitate to. Even if I barely see you...it&#146;s enough...&#148;

Rinako looked into Keiji&#146;s eyes. He was really serious. And she could 
tell that Keiji was developing some real feelings for her. But Rinako 
had never once said that she was looking for a full-on relationship. 

&#147;Keiji...are you in-&#147;

The man in question placed a finger to Rinako&#146;s lips. &#147;Shush. I have 
something to give you. But not here. Come with me.&#148; 

Rinako simply nodded and the two stood up. They left a small roll of 
notes to pay for their drinks and then left. Rinako had absolutely no 
idea what Keiji was going to give to her, but she knew that it meant 
something to him. After the two walked to the car park holding Keiji&#146;s 
car. They drove back down to the residential area and parked outside 
of Mizube Ai Park. Still following his air of secrecy, Keiji led 
Rinako to a secluded section of the park. 

There was a solitary bench. Keiji gently motioned for Rinako to sit, 
and she did so, still quite curious about what all this meant.   

Keiji took a seat next to Rinako. &#147;...Look...Rinako. I...have 
something need to tell you. We&#146;ve been dating for how long now?&#148; 

Rinako took the time to think. &#147;About...five months?&#148;

&#147;Yes...and in that time...I&#146;ve really gotten close to you. I know we 
hardly see each other these days, but...not a day goes by that I don&#146;t 
think of you.&#148;

&#147;Keiji...&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Keiji stopped her. &#147;Please, let me finish. Rinako...I need you 
to know how I feel. I love you. And I want us to take our relationship 
even further.&#148;

Whist Rinako looked on, Keiji took out a small velvet box from his 
pocket. With a hopeful smile, he opened it up and brandished its 
innards to Rinako.

The CBL leader was stunned. To see a shining silver ring. &#147;What is 
this?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a commitment ring. Rinako, I want us to go steady.&#148;

Bang. Rinako had a feeling that something like this was going to 
happen eventually. Even though she warned Keiji that she was not 
looking for a long lasting relationship, he still developed those 
emotional ties. Rinako liked Keiji a lot; he was such a sweet guy, but 
the idea of going any deeper than what they already had...

The shock Rinako was feeling was reflected in her voice. &#147;Keiji...I 
don&#146;t know what to say...&#148;

The brunette man just smiled and pressed the velvet box into Rinako&#146;s 
hands. &#147;You don&#146;t have to say anything. I love you, Rinako Ikatsuji.&#148;

With that, Keiji gently kissed her violet-haired angel. Though they 
had been reluctance on Rinako&#146;s part, she wasn&#146;t fighting it. And 
while the two were oblivious about their actions in their current 
surroundings, there was another person inside that secluded area. 

Ayane.

Just behind a large oak tree, stood Ayane. With the most fragile, 
heartbroken look of suffering anyone had ever seen. Although she did 
plan on keeping tabs on Keiji, coming across this was an accident. 
There was a shortcut to Tomeishuu through this park, and Ayane was 
returning from a ramen shop she frequently visited. Then she saw all 
of this. All the hurt feelings and emotions from two years came back 
whilst watching this, and instinct offered her the only option she 
could take at the time.

Run.

And so she did. It really didn&#146;t matter where or how, but Ayane just 
had to get away from that place. And a few seconds later, it was as if 
she had never been there are all. 

Just when conformation seemed to be at hand, Rinako pulled away 
sharply from Keiji&#146;s kiss. &#147;No...I can&#146;t...&#148;

Keiji breathed in hard. &#147;Why? What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;Keiji, I...I don&#146;t love you...&#148;
