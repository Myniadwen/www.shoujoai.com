Erica and Jocelyn were deep in the violent dance of lovemaking when the 
pregnant young girl slowed down, froze up, and ceased all action, save 
for the intake of breath. Erica noticed the change in her lover&#39;s 
disposition and removed herself from the infinite mass of skin to look 
into her best friend&#39;s eyes.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter? Are you feeling well?&quot; She reached out to curl her 
friend&#39;s chocolate hair, but her attentiveness was null. Erica had 
caused her friend some degree of pain before during sex, mostly when it 
came to the girl&#39;s steadily growing belly, but those issues had been 
ignored, and even at times, enjoyed. But something was different here.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I can do this anymore,&quot; came Jocelyn&#39;s reply.

&quot;Do what?&quot;

&quot;This.&quot;

&quot;You mean...sex?&quot;

&quot;I mean &#39;us&#39;,&quot; she emphasized. She carefully pried Erica off her sweaty 
body, sat up, and felt around in the dark for her clothes.

&quot;Oh. Um...Joss?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Erica...this is...not going to work out.&quot;

&quot;You mean our relationship?&quot; The slightest of nods came from her 
direction.

&quot;Look, being friends with you is one thing. And I don&#39;t even mind 
kissing you on the mouth. The sex was wonderful the first few times&#151;just 
you being there loving me in a purely physical way was outstanding&#151;but I 
don&#39;t think we should go on. It&#39;s not right.&quot;

&quot;What part of it&#39;s not right?&quot; Erica laid a warm hand on her friend&#39;s 
spine. Joss didn&#39;t recoil.

&quot;Look, you&#39;re gonna hate me for this, but I don&#39;t think...we should do 
this sort of thing. I don&#39;t...want to be your lover or your girlfriend 
anymore. I do love you, Erica, it&#39;s just...that&#39;s not me. It&#39;s not who I 
am.&quot;

&quot;...Oh.&quot; Her voice carried defeat that only the heartbroken would know 
of.

&quot;Listen, I have no regrets. I am glad I got to be with you like that, 
even if it was a short while. It was good. I just...think of you as a 
friend too much to...you know. Have something like that. Look, we still 
have a relationship, we just can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;I think I understand what you&#39;re trying to say,&quot; Fox whispered numbly.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t take this hard.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not. You&#39;re straight, I&#39;m gay. We had a good time. But you have to 
be honest with yourself. Could you have been able to see the two of us 
together in a year, or five years, or ten? Could we have raised that 
child of yours, just the two of us? Could you sacrifice...male 
companionship...in that sense...for me? Could you admit to homosexuality 
in the same way I could? No, I understand.&quot;

&quot;You sound so heartbroken.&quot; Erica sighed, hugging her friend from behind 
in spite of neither of them not having anything on.

&quot;I am...but I understand. It was...just a fantasy. I&#39;ll get over it.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully we can look each other in the eye again without any 
embarrassing moments,&quot; added Joss. &quot;I know it will be difficult. Making 
love to your best friend, and then breaking up with them because...it&#39;s 
not the way you know you want to live...it&#39;s hard. I&#39;m already feeling 
terrible. But hopefully we can both get over this. And I hope you 
forgive me.&quot;

&quot;Nothing to forgive,&quot; whimpered Erica, kissing Jocelyn&#39;s beautiful 
imperfect shoulders, covered with sweat. She sighed.

&quot;Okay then. So...we&#39;re cool?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Then may I use your shower?&quot;

&quot;Sure. I guess you don&#39;t want me to join you.&quot;

&quot;No, not this time. Let&#39;s not make things worse and put ourselves into a 
situation where we know we&#39;ll be tempted.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you mean, &#39;where I will be tempted&#39;?&quot; Both girls giggled faintly.

&quot;Well, you know...I&#39;m still...a little bit attracted to you.&quot; Erica 
smiled.

&quot;Then you better go. Any plans after you get out?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s late...and we&#39;re already here. I can sleep on the couch. I&#39;d 
say share a bed, but you know. Evening temptations.&quot; Erica laughed, and 
restrained herself from kissing her best friend and ex-lover as she got 
up and walked to the bathroom. So, once again, she was alone. She had to 
wonder how Alisha would take this. Only one way to find out, so she 
reached for her cell phone.

&quot;...What? How dare she break my little sister&#39;s heart!&quot;

&quot;Alisha, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m all right with it. I told her I understood.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just gonna bend? I thought you loved her, Ricky.&quot;

&quot;I do. I just can&#39;t... I have to be realistic about this.&quot;

&quot;Fuck realism, go and tell her you love her.&quot;

&quot;Alisha, I can&#39;t. It would only make things worse. Please understand.&quot;

&quot;...Hmph. I don&#39;t like this. She drags you along and then pulls this. 
Nothing but a screw and bolt world.&quot;

&quot;Alisha, it wasn&#39;t like that! She&#39;s not...like that.&quot;

&quot;You are such a pussy. Can&#39;t see how we&#39;re related.&quot;

&quot;You shut up! God, can&#39;t you for once just be supportive of me?!&quot;

&quot;Look, I&#39;m trying, okay? Kinda hard when you keep on defending her!&quot;

&quot;I have to, she&#39;s my friend! No matter what, we&#39;ll still be friends.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah, right. Next thing you know, she&#39;ll have another girlfriend. 
Then what&#39;ll you say?&quot;

&quot;Jocelyn&#39;s not like that.&quot;

&quot;...Well, she is more your friend than mine.&quot;

&quot;For a reason.&quot;

&quot;All right! God, sorry! Pull that stick out of your ass and throw it 
away, jeez! I&#39;m sorry, okay&#151;there, you happy?&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t mean it.&quot;

&quot;......Erica, I&#39;m sorry. You know I love you, and I&#39;m trying to stick up 
for you. You just...get so defensive sometimes. And it&#39;s not cute over 
the phone.&quot;

&quot;You are such a cunt.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. But hey, at least I admit it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

&quot;So we cool?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re still cool. Sorry. I can be a cunt too.&quot;

&quot;Not often. Sorry I bitched about your buddy. Hey, how bout&#39; I treat you 
to breakfast when ya get home, huh? On the house.&quot;

&quot;Alisha, you can&#39;t afford Ramen Noodles, let alone breakfast.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Really.&quot; Erica giggled.

&quot;Look, I gotta go. I guess I should thank you for doing the sisterly 
thing.&quot;

&quot;Hey, no prob. Kiss-kiss.&quot;

&quot;Kiss-kiss. Bye.&quot; Click. Sigh. Erica looked to the bathroom, still 
hearing the water running. Jocelyn would be out in a matter of moments, 
then it would be her turn. After that... She could only hope they could 
return to normal.

.........

Somehow, Amina found herself staying the night at Nomi&#39;s house. Ah, 
Nomi. Apparently the only girl in the whole school&#151;or for that matter, 
the whole world&#151;who not only realized that there was a living breathing 
girl here who had some degree of talent, but who befriended her and even 
liked her! Amina felt flattered, and surprised, and a little scared. 
Such attentiveness towards a person who was used to being invisible 
was...unhealthy.

Amina didn&#39;t know whether she really had a crush on the other girl, as 
she had suspected at times, or if she just liked her immensely. She knew 
she couldn&#39;t talk to anybody about it&#151;after all, who ever listened to 
her?&#151;and she couldn&#39;t confess, she just couldn&#39;t. Everyone at the church 
would know if she did. She would be condemned and cast out, all for a 
suspicion, for a guess. She knew that having those feelings for Nomi, 
for any girl, was wrong, but...why did being around Miss Nakatori feel 
so good? Why did she feel more like herself during those sessions than 
any other moment?

And so here she was, sharing a bed with Nomi. Nomi and Amina. A 
descendant of Native Americans, and a descendant of Muslims. A girl who 
had ran to God when her father left her, and a girl who had grown up in 
that environment. An artist, and another artist. A first-year student, 
and another first-year student. A seeker and a Catholic. Two people who 
could&#39;ve been invisible everywhere else, except where they weren&#39;t 
wanted. Two people that, at one time, had shared something very 
intimate, something they had never given anybody else.

Actually, if Amina recalled correctly, she had kissed Nomi twice.

Washim knew it wasn&#39;t a sin to feel tempted, but some strange sensation 
in her mind told her to scoot closer, to drape her arms around the only 
person in the whole world who truly understood her, to lean down and 
take those pearly lips into her own. She wanted to. She felt the urge. 
She had to drive it away, she had to grasp the crucifix, she had to 
think of God&#39;s commands. She must not commit such things with Nomi (but 
at that age, she knew she shouldn&#39;t even do it with a boy). Her hand 
trailed over at least, and touched the girl&#39;s raven-wing hair. Touched, 
and trailed, and teased...

&quot;You can&#39;t sleep either?&quot; Amina shyly withdrew her hand as Nomi tossed 
around, facing her. &quot;Neither can I. Is something on your mind?&quot;

&quot;N-nothing,&quot; she said shyly. Nomi made a face.

&quot;See, when you say &#39;nothing&#39;, I know it&#39;s something, so don&#39;t lie to 
me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not lying. It&#39;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;Now I know it&#39;s something. Hey, you can tell me. We&#39;re close friends, 
right?&quot; Amina nodded. &quot;And I&#39;ve told you a few deep secrets too, right?&quot; 
Again, a nod. &quot;So...what&#39;s keeping you back? Getting it out is better 
than bottling it in, and now&#39;s the perfect time to do it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve nothing bottled up.&quot;

&quot;Washim.&quot; She edged closer and took her hands...those beautiful, 
reddened hands that could move with such dexterity if they had a pencil 
and paper... &quot;Please. Trust me.&quot;

I&#39;m afraid.

&quot;Afraid of what?&quot; She squeaked.

&quot;That I might be falling for you.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s scary?&quot; She nodded. &quot;Oh. ...Oh. So you&#39;re...and you 
think...oh. ...Oh. I don&#39;t know how to handle that. Uh...so is that what 
those kisses were about? Because I just thought you were doing it 
because you were curious, or you just...liked me. I mean, I didn&#39;t 
mind...&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re a lesbian?&quot;

&quot;I am only myself,&quot; quoth Nomi sagely. &quot;If what I do or think or believe 
defines me, I might not be myself anymore. All I am is myself. 
Everything that makes me up is a part of me. I can&#39;t be gay if I&#39;m 
myself, for if I&#39;m attracted to other girls, then it must be a part of 
who I am. But to answer your question, I have been attracted to you for 
awhile. If that makes you uncomfortable, I understand.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just...confused. And you seem to be taking this well.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s something I&#39;ve been thinking about,&quot; she sighed humbly. &quot;Ever 
since you...you know...I&#39;ve been thinking. I had a feeling, too, but I 
didn&#39;t want to say anything that would push you away. Look, maybe we 
should just date for awhile and see how things go.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Hear me out,&quot; she insisted. &quot;Let&#39;s go on a few harmless dates, nothing 
more, and see where they lead us. If we want to go forward, okay. If 
not, fine. We&#39;re both a little too young to decide what we really are 
anyway.&quot; Amina grinned as Nomi finished her soliloquy. In all her years, 
she had never heard such wisdom coming from somebody so young. 
Everything she said made sense, and needed no further elaboration.

&quot;How&#39;d you get so smart?&quot;

&quot;Oh...you pick stuff up. Mostly mom. And Sarah Jo, and Mrs. Keys.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; They grinned again; Nomi surprised Amina slightly by silently 
leaning in for a kiss. Amina took her into her arms, tossing inhibition 
aside, and dared to drink deep from a forbidden pool. The ambrosia was 
more intoxicating than any beer, more uplifting than any soda, more 
powerful than any poison. It was during that night where two souls gave 
in to their evening temptations, just as two before them had resisted 
them, and two later would soon be tested...

.........

It had only been four months since their first meeting, and yet it had 
felt like every single obstacle, trial, mountain, and valley had ran 
into them along the way. Ancelin Yi and Ivory Tran had been through it 
all, or most of it all, and they only had one night together, plus the 
winter vacation, before they would have to go back through it all again. 
But they were together, that was the point&#151;the very reason they believed 
everything they had been through together, whether as friends or 
strangers, rivals or girlfriends, had been worth it. This was their 
first night together, the first time they would sleep under the same 
roof&#151;in essence, the accumulation of their relationship up to that very 
period in time.

And in spite of having slept with countless girls before, Ivory Tran was 
nervous.

It had happened quite suddenly. Ivory had been walking Ancelin home, as 
she had started to do since first officially becoming her girlfriend, 
and the two were engaged in meaningless conversation&#151;just this and that, 
whatever came up. Ivory started to prod into Ancelin&#39;s mother&#39;s 
relationship with her girlfriend, asking how it was going and how they 
were handling each other.

&quot;I&#39;d imagine it&#39;d be tough coming out to your own daughter like that,&quot; 
she said.

&quot;She did look to be struggling, but it was all right in the end. We 
accepted each other.&quot;

&quot;It does sound kinda hot when you think about it,&quot; mentioned Tran 
foxily. Ancelin gave her a playful slap for the remark. &quot;No, really. 
Well, plus, your mom&#39;s totally cool. Mine is...god, what a pain in the 
ass!&quot;

&quot;What about your father?&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; whispered Ivory, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t seen him since I 
hit puberty, but I get letters all the time. He and mom split up, of 
course, and he&#39;s been wandering around too much for me to really see 
him. Last I heard, about a year ago, he was off in Berlin doing a 
report.&quot;

&quot;So your father&#39;s in Europe?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m guessing. Mom just screams when I ask about him, and he never gives 
me an address, not even an email address. But he was like my hero when 
he was still here; mom says, or yells, I&#39;m more like him than her. I 
guess that means he&#39;s a real womanizer!&quot; Ivory laughed, apparently not 
bothered by the idea at all, and Ancelin replied as always, quietly.

&quot;My dad,&quot; she said after a lull, &quot;you already know about.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. Still incarcerated, huh? Well good riddance. If I ever saw the 
bastard, I&#39;d deck him. How dare he hurt two such wonderful women! Your 
mom&#39;s better off without him.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t disagree. I do find it a little odd that she seems happier with 
Kiki, but...it&#39;s her life, and I&#39;m happy too. She chose right for once.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say!&quot; Ancelin chuckled and slapped Ivory again, then leaned in to 
kiss her cheek. Of course, Ivory squealed. Any attention like that made 
her melt on the inside, like nothing anybody else had ever done. Ancelin 
was just...indescribably good for her, like a breath of fresh air after 
being buried alive...

When they made it to the house, still a little cold from the 
mid-December wind, Ancelin drew Ivory in for a hug and kept her in her 
arms. Ivory was stunned. She had never been so close to her new 
girlfriend before, so close that she could smell her and feel her shiver 
from cold and anticipation, never so intimate that she could feel 
so...secure, loved, regardless of her pride and lechery. Ivory sighed 
and, being shorter, rested her head on Ancelin&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Come inside,&quot; she could hear her beloved whisper. The words uplifted 
her, reviving like a jolt of lightning, and she looked up to smile. Oh 
yeah. She was definitely taking her up on this offer.

Madeline, Ancelin&#39;s mother, and Kiki her lover cooked dinner. The entire 
clan was there: Ancelin&#39;s uncle, aunt, and cousin as well, who had all 
noticed the change in Mrs. Yi over the past few months, and were glad 
she was finally starting to glow again. So what if the one she loved was 
a woman? As long as she was healthy and content, it didn&#39;t matter. Even 
her brother thought it was a good match&#151;better than the last one. When 
it came time to do the dishes, Ancelin volunteered, and even though she 
was a guest, Ivory chipped in as well.

&quot;God, I wish I had your family,&quot; she sighed as she put dishes, cups, and 
forks into hot, bubbling water. &quot;Mine is just messed up. My grandparents 
were cool, I hear, but they all died before I was born&#151;gramps was a war 
hero, granny a war nurse. I don&#39;t have any uncles, aunts, or cousins, 
since both my parents were the only kids in their family. My mom&#39;s an 
asshole, dad&#39;s lollygagging in Europe, and I&#39;m stuck here fucking up my 
life.&quot;

&quot;So you think you&#39;re life&#39;s a waste.&quot;

&quot;Not anymore; what I meant was before. Before, I was fucking shit up, 
but now I&#39;ve got more of a purpose, a clear mind. Namely you.&quot; Ancelin 
gave a rosy smile, and started drying dishes. The Yi household had an 
automatic dishwasher, but the girls wanted to do things the manual way, 
since it seemed more intimate and...romantic.

&quot;Yeah... Believe it or not, I was really lost too, before you crashed 
into my life. I was depressed and aloof, and I barely had any friends. 
Close ones, anyway. I found myself becoming distant, a loner, the 
proverbial ice queen that so many people would come to identify me as. I 
certainly didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever be desired. Then beautiful you came 
around and tore all that nonsense to pieces.&quot; Ivory grinned bashfully.

&quot;You really think I&#39;m beautiful?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, of course.&quot; Ancelin trailed her hand down her girlfriend&#39;s long 
bleached-blonde hair, squeezing it gently like it was a bunch of 
spaghetti. She looked deep into Ivory&#39;s eyes, mischievous brown and 
heartwarming blue, and couldn&#39;t resist caressing the cheek that had held 
so many feisty smiles in its life. Ivory had felt such attention before, 
but it had never been so genuine, so pure and unconditional. It was 
love, she knew; Ancelin just had yet to say it.

&quot;So I&#39;m grateful,&quot; she said, and resumed drying. &quot;That&#39;s why I like you 
as my girlfriend. That&#39;s why I told mom I was gay, despite you being the 
only girl I&#39;ve ever been attracted to. Of course, there&#39;s also that wild 
side of yours, which does drive me crazy now and then&#151;in a good way.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Ivory gave a twisted smile, and weaseled her fingers over 
to Ancelin&#39;s ear. She tickled it until her girlfriend hissed.

&quot;Stop,&quot; she managed. Ivory leaned close and whispered.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll lose my concentration.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, we can&#39;t have beautiful you breaking those dishes.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Ivory released her fingers, kissed Ancelin&#39;s cheek, and licked 
her ear just for good measure. Ancelin gasped and dropped something, but 
thankfully it was plastic.

&quot;Are you girls okay?&quot; called Madeline. Ancelin blushed as Ivory drew 
very close.

&quot;Um...yes!&quot; A pause.

&quot;Okay! Take your time.&quot;

&quot;Mom!!&quot; Ivory laughed along with Madeline; poor Ancelin was red in the 
face.

And then...

Why don&#39;t you stay over for the night?

You mean sleep on the couch?

No, you can share my bed.

Evening temptations, indeed. Ivory accepted, of course, but...

She did not want to ruin her relationship with Ancelin. She wanted to do 
everything right. When Ancelin offered to sleep with Ivory, she knew she 
didn&#39;t mean &quot;sex&quot;. She meant &quot;SLEEP&quot;, as in closing one&#39;s eyes and 
resting for eight hours. But Ivory was tempted, oh was she tempted! 
First, the urges came about during showering. As guest, she had first 
dibs, and coyly wondered if her beloved wanted to join her. Ancelin 
declined.

&quot;I&#39;m not...ready yet,&quot; she whispered in a throaty voice. Okay. No 
problem. It was a little fast anyway. But when it came to Ancelin&#39;s 
turn, Ivory was severely tempted to open the bathroom door, just a 
crack&#151;and then to step inside and gaze at the shadowy form of her nude 
girlfriend&#151;and then to undress and open the curtain&#151;and then... But she 
couldn&#39;t, she couldn&#39;t. She forced herself not to. She had to obey 
Ancelin&#39;s wishes. She wanted privacy, for now. She didn&#39;t want sex, not 
yet. All those things would come in time, but for now, &quot;Annie&quot; merely 
wanted to enjoy her current holdings.

In other words, she wanted to experience the full joys of dinner before 
moving to dessert. As a child, Ivory always did beg for the sweet stuff 
first...

The next problem came with evening wear. Ivory typically slept nude, and 
when there was no lover beside her, she usually pleasured herself. She 
knew she Could Not do such things in Ancelin&#39;s presence, probably not 
for a long time. Ancelin, for the record, had pajamas that loosely 
resembled her kendo uniform, but she didn&#39;t have any spares. Ivory took 
to wearing her underwear, sans brassiere&#151;&quot;It&#39;s so fucking uncomfortable 
to sleep in that thing!&quot;, she had declared&#151;and a simple A-shirt instead, 
which was almost as good as nothing.

Then, the moment of truth. Sharing a bed. Sleeping underneath the same 
covers. Being in close contact. With Ancelin. It was insane. It was 
worse than having an idea on the tip of her tongue, worse than knowing 
an answer and yet not knowing it, worse than having to wait for a free 
stall in the bathroom, even worse than feeling a sneeze coming while 
food was in her mouth. It was pain. Ivory feared for her life. Every 
movement would no doubt upset Ancelin and drive her out of her life 
forever. She could barely breathe, let alone sleep. Thankfully...

&quot;Hey, is something wrong? You look awful!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s...really unusual, being here like this,&quot; managed Tran, her voice 
tittering. &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve been dreaming about this moment ever since the 
first day I met you, literally, and now that it&#39;s here... I&#39;m afraid of 
screwing up again. I wanna keep our relationship, because I really like 
you, and I don&#39;t wanna be apart from you again, but I&#39;m afraid that if I 
even move...you&#39;ll just...&quot;

Ancelin silenced her girlfriend with a sweet, short kiss.

&quot;Ivory.&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; she whispered. Ancelin&#39;s eyes were so deep and expressive...

&quot;Hold me. Kiss me. Feel me.&quot;

Ivory put her arms around Ancelin and squeezed her tight. She placed her 
mouth on the girl&#39;s beautiful two lips, the act she loved so dearly and 
intensely, and let them embrace countless times, sometimes with tears of 
joy. She felt Ancelin&#39;s breasts timidly poke out from her pajama top; 
she could feel the girl&#39;s legs twitching with the beginnings of sexual 
want; she could sense every curve, dip, and expanse of the young woman&#39;s 
face as she let her mouth touch upon it. She opened her lips to present 
her tongue; Ancelin declined and kept her mouth shut.

&quot;No,&quot; she whispered, &quot;not yet.&quot; Ivory stopped. She was experiencing too 
much euphoria to care.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said with a grin. &quot;Can&#39;t help it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; And to prove that it was, Ancelin leaned forward and 
playfully licked Ivory&#39;s lips. Tran squealed in rapture and jerked back; 
the two embraced and rubbed noses lovingly. Ancelin licked Ivory&#39;s lips 
again, slower, and stared back with shimmering eyes.

&quot;Now lick mine.&quot; She needed no further invitation. Ancelin tasted...oh, 
better than anything or anyone she had known, even better than papa&#39;s 
cooking at nine in the morning. Ivory felt her womanhood become moist 
simply because she was running her tongue over Ancelin&#39;s closed mouth, 
so she stopped after awhile and caught her breath. To further &quot;torture&quot; 
her, Ancelin licked her own lips, sucking in all the little trails of 
saliva Ivory had left.

It was pretty much better than sex, she had to admit.

&quot;You wanna...?&quot; she inquired. Ancelin shyly held back. Ivory did love 
the girl&#39;s bashfulness; it made her seem so cute and vulnerable!

&quot;I...uh... If you promise to...you know.&quot;

&quot;You trust me, right? Right?&quot;

&quot;Of course. Just...uh...um, I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t doubt you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Ivory kissed her cheek. &quot;You don&#39;t have to.&quot;

But...I want to.

She surprised her girlfriend by slowly pinning her down, leaning over, 
and painting her lips with her tongue. Ivory was taken aback as she felt 
Ancelin&#39;s palms clasp over her wrists, like some gentle dominatrix, and 
the feeling intensified as the girl&#39;s hot pink tongue touched her lips. 
Ohh...! Was she tempted to stick her own tongue and ravish the other 
girl, but! She Could Not. No, she must not. She would not.

&quot;Annie,&quot; she squeaked as her girlfriend released her. Ancelin smiled and 
wiped the tears away.

&quot;That&#39;s enough, I think. I&#39;m tired now. Do you mind?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s fine. It&#39;s perfect, actually.&quot; She grinned.

&quot;Well, wo ai ni, Ivory.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; Had Ancelin said what she thought she said?!

&quot;Wo ai ni,&quot; she repeated. &quot;You said it meant good-night, right?&quot;

&quot;...Huh? Hey, wait&#151;you remember?!&quot; Ancelin smiled and nodded; Ivory 
clutched her mouth in surprise. Ancelin had remembered what she said on 
their first date! It was a sweet gesture, but Ivory had to tell her the 
truth. &quot;Uh, Annie,&quot; she chuckled nervously, &quot;I have a little confession 
for ya. Wo ai ni, in Chinese Mandarin, doesn&#39;t mean good-night.&quot;

&quot;What does it mean?&quot; she asked neutrally. Ivory grinned sweetly and 
caressed her face.

&quot;It means... &#39;I love you&#39;.&quot;

Ancelin stared at her silently for a very, very long time.

&quot;So even back then...you knew? For sure?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she whispered. Ancelin smiled sweetly, and drew her girlfriend 
in for a deep, passionate kiss. Her eyes brimmed with happy tears as she 
touched Ivory&#39;s face with all the love that she herself had brought out.

&quot;Ivory,&quot; she murmured, &quot;je&#39;taime, Ivory.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that mean?&quot; Ancelin grinned.

&quot;It means......good-night.&quot; For a moment, Ivory was lost. But then, the 
full scope of what Ancelin had said hit her, and she burst open with 
love and tears and a wailing voice overwhelmed with happiness. She 
embraced Ancelin and they kissed; it was an hour before they finally 
went to bed, happy and in love, wrapped safely in the security of their 
arms.
