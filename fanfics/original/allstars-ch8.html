10:42 am

            &quot;So you won&#39;t be able to make it to the meeting today?&quot;

            &quot;No, sorry, and Katt&#39;s going to finish unpacking.  I promise 
we&#39;ll make the next one.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, it&#39;s all right.  We all have obligations.  Besides, 
since the team hasn&#39;t been completed yet, this will be more like an 
unofficial get-together.  I just thought it was high time we met each 
other.&quot;

            &quot;Sounds like a good idea.  If you like, you can give me a 
few highlights at the try-outs later today.&quot;

            &quot;Mm-hmm, I was planning on doing that anyway.  Um, before I 
go to call the others, would you mind telling me what you have planned 
instead?&quot;

            &quot;You sound upset,&quot; Leena grinned.  &quot;Relax, Freya, I&#39;m seeing 
somebody concerning another possible player.  You know I&#39;d never miss a 
meeting unless it was important.  Why don&#39;t you put those resources of 
yours to good use and see if you can&#39;t fill in a few blanks?  That way, 
we might get enough members to hold another session before school 
starts, and I guarantee I&#39;ll be there.&quot;

            &quot;That sounds like a great idea!  I&#39;ll get right on it!  I&#39;ll 
try and stress it to the others as well.&quot;

            &quot;Okay, I appreciate it.  Sorry I couldn&#39;t make it.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry,&quot; she laughed softly.  &quot;That just means 
less people to spend money on!&quot;

            Freya&#39;s smile vanished as she hung up.  Being so perky and 
energetic really wiped her out, but she had to keep pretending, at least 
until she called everyone.  They needed to understand that this would be 
an informal affair, and that they could always rely on their manager to 
cheer them up, even if she felt ready to collapse.  Taking a deep 
breath, Freya threw some pills in her mouth, washed them down, and 
flipped her Rolodex to the next name.

You complete my fate

The world unwinds inside of me

You complete my fate

The halo crawls away

You repeat my fate

Rewinding all we can

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Come and save me

You complete my fate

The heavens stroll inside of me

You repeat my fate

Revealing who we are

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Fill me up

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Let me follow

&quot;Answering the Call&quot;

            &quot;Thanks for the grub, Freya!  Later!&quot;

            Lauren Ofdensen was smiling as she left Chili&#39;s and wandered 
to her car.  The meeting had gone well, she had met several fascinating 
and sexy women, and she even got a free meal out of it!  Balancing her 
take-out box in one hand and her small all-purpose sack in the other 
(she detested purses), Lauren fished around for her cell phone, positive 
that she had gotten a call earlier.  Sure enough, as she flipped the 
case open, a message reading &quot;You missed 1 call(s) and have 1 
message(s)&quot; flickered to life, and prodding a little further, she 
discovered a friend of hers had tried to get in touch.  Lauren sought 
the solitude of her car before listening to the message.

            &quot;It&#39;s me.  I&#39;m probably interrupting something.  I&#39;d just 
like to inform you that we will be attending the same university now.  
You&#39;ll probably interpret this as a continuation of our so-called 
rivalry.  Well, come what may, our relationship has been given an 
extension, so if you&#39;ve been hoping to get rid of me, I am sorry to 
disappoint.  Call me back so I know you&#39;re not dead.&quot;

            (End of messages,) came the annoying recorded voice Lauren 
had grown so accustomed to.  (To delete this mess--)  She pressed 7, 
trashing it, then ran through her list of missed calls.  Wouldn&#39;t her 
friend be pissed to learn that her fiercest archrival was still alive!  
Prompt as always, the woman answered her phone after only one ring.

            &quot;Afternoon.  I presume you received my message?&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, sorry to disappoint ya!  But hey, it&#39;s great we still 
get to go to school together.  Why didn&#39;t you tell me you were going to 
CU?&quot;

            &quot;Mmn, no reason.  I just didn&#39;t.  It will take me awhile to 
move there, but I&#39;ve already registered for classes.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, so&#39;re we gonna be rivals again?&quot;  The other woman 
sighed deeply.

            &quot;I don&#39;t know what goes through that head of yours.&quot;

            &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m gonna beat&#39;cha!&quot;

            &quot;Fine, you win, you&#39;re better than me.  Satisfied?&quot;

            &quot;Tsk, you&#39;re no fun.  But you are taking a psych class, 
right?&quot;

            &quot;Yes, so we might be in the same room together.  Heaven 
forbid.&quot;

            &quot;Naw, we can be study-buddies!  Oh, hey, I&#39;ve got news as 
well.  You&#39;ll never guess.&quot;  Lauren smiled smugly, almost sticking her 
tongue out with glee.  The other woman paused a moment to humor her 
friend.

            &quot;Let&#39;s see.  Does it have anything to do with baseball?&quot;

            &quot;Sadly, no, but you&#39;re close.&quot;

            &quot;Then I give up.&quot;

            &quot;No fun at all!&quot; she yelled.  Her friend smirked just a 
little.  &quot;All right, have it your way.  I got into the Carnegie soccer 
team, through some freak chance.&quot;

            &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be so surprised:  you were always a very 
athletic girl.  But why make the transition?&quot;

            &quot;I dunno,&quot; Lauren grumbled.  &quot;This old bat conned me into 
it.  Hey, watch out for that Rosewood bitch:  she&#39;ll talk you into 
anything if you give her the chance.&quot;

            &quot;You mean the retired General, Stacie Rosewood?&quot;  There was 
finally a trace of surprise in the woman&#39;s voice, something even Lauren 
didn&#39;t hear often.  &quot;Hmm.  I never imagined.  That might make my tenure 
even more interesting.  I will be arriving there today, around 3:30, so 
I would appreciate it if you helped me move in.&quot;  Lauren shrugged 
haphazardly.

            &quot;Sure thing.  What else do I have going on?  I might even 
introduce you to a few of my sexy new friends.&quot;

            &quot;I do hope you&#39;ve not done anything Quixotic yet,&quot; she 
sighed before bidding Lauren farewell.  The redhead smirked, put her 
phone away, and drove out of the parking lot.

            &quot;She hasn&#39;t changed at all.&quot;

Soft-spoken, studious, self-effacing siren

Both a proud narcissist and an insecure neurotic

Breaking the mirror in and of her mind

Arina Essylt

            Since most of the women had gotten all the important things 
out of the way--moving in, getting a job, registering for classes, and 
applying for the school soccer team--they could spend what was left of 
their summer vacation as they pleased.  Lauren would most likely have a 
party in the future; Terra preferred prowling the mall in search of the 
latest manga and video games.  Since she had only moved recently, she 
didn&#39;t know her way around very well, so she called Amy and Freya, who 
gave her a few pointers.

            &quot;You like games?  Hmm...what about graphic animation?&quot;

            &quot;Oh yeah!  That&#39;s actually the field I wanted to get into!&quot;

            &quot;You&#39;re in luck!&quot; Freya chirped.  &quot;The company I own is 
expanding, and we really need some computer graphics designers.  Oh, 
wait--you already have a job, don&#39;t you?&quot;

            &quot;Yes, at Parody.  Uh...but you know, I don&#39;t work there 
every day.  I&#39;ve got the weekends off.  Would it be okay if I checked it 
out first?&quot;

            &quot;Sure, we&#39;d love to have you come by!  It&#39;s halfway between 
my house and the mall; however, it&#39;s located on a relatively new lot of 
land, so we aren&#39;t shoulder to shoulder with our neighbors.  Don&#39;t 
worry, you&#39;ll find it!  See you there!&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, and thanks for the directions.&quot;  Terra put her cell 
phone away and tried getting her bearings.  This mall was so different 
than the one she was accustomed to; everything was turned around and 
mixed up.  Freya told her that the nearest video game store was around 
JC Penny&#39;s, between Aeropostle and The Golden Kernel, so she followed 
her nose until she was struck with the buttery aroma of popcorn.  A shop 
labeled Game Stop was right next to it, so she stepped inside shyly, 
noticing how very few customers there were.  She had the whole store to 
herself, but it also made her feel vulnerable.

            But then, she saw it:  a diamond in the rough.

            &quot;No...freaking...way!&quot; she gasped.  The only visible 
employee was playing a game Terra recognized all too well, one she had 
wanted to play for ages, but never got the chance.  With her mouth still 
hanging open, she addressed the woman:  &quot;Is that Mother 2?&quot;

            &quot;It sure is,&quot; she answered coolly.  &quot;AKA Earthbound.  I&#39;m 
glad there&#39;s somebody out there who still appreciates the classics.  
Lately it&#39;s been nothing but advanced this and new-gen that, digital 
revolution crap and hi-def nonsense.  Feh!  All skin and no heart.&quot;

            &quot;Is it for sale?&quot; Terra asked, feeling her adrenaline rush.  
&quot;Please tell me it&#39;s on sale!&quot;

            &quot;Sorry,&quot; the older woman grinned, &quot;it&#39;s actually my copy.  
You&#39;re welcome to play it, but I&#39;m not about to let it go.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, please!&quot; she begged, nearly stamping the floor.  &quot;How 
much do you want, really?  What if money was no object?&quot;

            &quot;No object?&quot; she grinned, rubbing her cheek.  &quot;Well, with 
the system and the game, I might let it go for a thousand bucks.&quot;

            &quot;WHAT!  That&#39;s not fair!  I could get it on Ebay cheaper 
than that!&quot;

            &quot;Not anymore,&quot; she replied, saving her game and resetting 
the system.  She gave Terra a controller, not wanting her to walk away 
broken-hearted.  &quot;Come on, give it a whirl.  I gotta get back to work 
anyway.  If there&#39;s anything you want, just ask--I mean, anything 
besides that.&quot;

            &quot;You won&#39;t reconsider?&quot; she whimpered.  &quot;Come on, I&#39;ve never 
played Mother 2.&quot;

            &quot;So play it, unless you&#39;re in some kinda hurry!&quot;

            &quot;But I want to take it home with me,&quot; she sighed.  The 
employee smiled warmly, and returned behind the counter to organize her 
stock.

            &quot;Trust me, I know exactly how you feel.  Nintendo should&#39;ve 
imported the Mother series to the DS--but while we&#39;re fantasizing, I may 
as well say that Sony should&#39;ve released Suikoden one and two for the 
states.  Buncha morons...&quot;  Her sour expression slowly improved, and her 
eyes sparkled craftily as she came up with an idea.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s make a 
deal.  I&#39;ll go ahead and give it to you if you can beat me at Smash 
Brothers Brawl.&quot;  Terra snorted as she paused her game.

            &quot;Are you serious?  I have to warn you, I&#39;m pretty good at 
that.&quot;

            &quot;Well, I&#39;m not so bad myself.  You up for it?&quot;

            &quot;Sure, I&#39;ve got nothing to lose.&quot;  The employee looked over 
at Terra&#39;s purse, where a small trinket was dangling.

            &quot;You could wager that Lucca keychain you got there,&quot; she 
pointed.  Terra noticed it had gotten loose and snapped it in her palm, 
feeling very possessive.  It was cast in the image of her favorite 
character from one of her favorite games; she had bought it when her 
family went to Vietnam a few years back to visit relatives.  It had 
taken a lot of time, effort, and money to secure, and at first, Terra 
was reluctant to gamble with it.  But when she realized she held her 
keychain with the same esteem this woman held her game in, it seemed 
like a fair trade, and she placed it on the Wii system.

            &quot;Fine, it&#39;s a deal, but I hope you&#39;re ready to lose.&quot;

            &quot;A good gamer is ready for anything,&quot; the woman replied.  As 
the game moved to the character selection screen, she immediately went 
to select Pit, while Terra chose Jigglypuff, a move that usually 
bewildered her opponents.  The reaction was no different today:  &quot;Wow, 
Jigglypuff, huh?  You&#39;re either really good or really brave.&quot;

            &quot;Maybe I&#39;m both!&quot; Terra crowed, feeling herself grow more 
extroverted again.  She was always bashful and quiet around strangers, 
but was quick to become the life of the party around her close 
friends...or anyone who shared her passion.  Before the match started, 
she felt it necessary to introduce herself to her opponent, like a true 
honorable warrior.  &quot;I&#39;m Terra, by the way.&quot;

Self-proclaimed champion, fueled by indomitable endurance

Extroverted gamer, tomboyish and sweet

Reticent on matters of love alone, broken home, doubtful heart

Jennifer Andre

            &quot;But most people call me Jen,&quot; she said as the match began.  
&quot;So are you a gamer?&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, pretty avid, but I&#39;m also into manga and Tae Kwon 
Do.&quot;

            &quot;Nice!  Oh, crap, that was low!  I&#39;ll get you back for that, 
you know.&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; Terra giggled.  But she also had to admit that 
Jen was good, at least as good as her, if not better.  So, first there 
was Amy with martial arts, and now Jennifer with games:  Terra now had 
equals in two aspects of her life, and she vaguely wondered if she would 
befriend this new woman in the same manner.

            &quot;Say, if you&#39;re a gamer, you should come to the tournaments 
they hold in Parody bookstore.  Do you know where that is?&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, I work there.&quot;  Jen clucked her tongue as she gained 
a momentary advantage.

            &quot;Tsk, lucky.  That place is awesome.  So what&#39;s your 
favorite game?&quot;

            &quot;Well, I really like the Star Ocean series, but recently I 
got into Valkyrie Profile-the PSP version, I mean.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, cool.  I&#39;ve got the original.  Heh, it&#39;s kinda 
stone-age now, but it&#39;s still one of the greats.  You ever do any online 
gaming?&quot;

            &quot;Some, when I can.  I fiddled around with Warcraft and Gaios 
for awhile.&quot;

            &quot;No kidding!&quot; Jen exclaimed as her character was thrown off 
the ledge.  &quot;I&#39;ve been playing GAOG for awhile.&quot;  Terra grinned as she 
moved into a fierce combo.

            &quot;Oh yeah?  Maybe we&#39;ve met.&quot;

            &quot;It&#39;s possible.  I&#39;m Sarishaun Tartarus, the bandit 
princess.&quot;

            &quot;No...WAY!!&quot;  Terra paused her game to stare in awe.  &quot;Oh my 
god, you&#39;re Sarishaun?!  I&#39;m Huynh the centaur!  We&#39;re partners!&quot;

            &quot;No friggin&#39; way!!&quot;  Jen and Terra laughed and hugged each 
other, two online friends finally meeting in person.  Something like 
this cannot be a coincidence:  Jen thanked the divine intervention of 
God, while Terra chalked it up to her good karma.  &quot;God, I was wondering 
what happened to you!  You never told me where you were moving to.&quot;

            &quot;Sorry.  Uh, if you want my new address, I can give it to 
you.&quot;

            &quot;Sounds great.  I was worried I wouldn&#39;t be able to send you 
a birthday-slash-Valentine&#39;s day card this year.  Uh...so you got 
enrolled at Carnegie, right?&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, and their soccer team.&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;ve heard about that.  Some of the guys that come around 
here tried out.  I hear they&#39;re really strict about who gets in.&quot;

            &quot;Uh, not so much,&quot; Terra grinned sheepishly.  Jen wondered 
what her friend meant by that at first, but figured it out soon enough, 
and hugged her again.

            &quot;Wow, congratulations!  I guess you&#39;re moving up in the 
world.&quot;

            &quot;Slowly but surely.  Oh, the match!&quot;

            &quot;Bah, forget about it,&quot; Jen smiled as she reset the system.  
&quot;I can just give you the game.  I mean, I already got it on the Wii 
Virtual Console.  There&#39;s really no point in keeping two.&quot;  Terra&#39;s face 
was blindingly bright; her eyes were as wide as saucers, and her mouth 
was a great big happy grin.

            &quot;Ah...are you serious?  You&#39;re giving it to me free of 
charge?!  Ohmygod, Jen, I love you!&quot;  She tackled the older woman, 
purring and humming happily; Jen laughed and pried her away.

            &quot;Thanks, but I never said I was giving it away for free.  
How about a trade?  Yoink!&quot;  She snatched up Terra&#39;s keychain, twirling 
it on her finger.  &quot;This is the friend&#39;s discount,&quot; she announced 
proudly.  &quot;Are you happy with it?&quot;

            Terra didn&#39;t even need to consider her answer:  &quot;Sure, as 
long as you guarantee everything&#39;s in working order.&quot;

            &quot;I swear on Sarishaun&#39;s Hawkeye Crossbow.&quot;  Terra smiled 
warmly and helped Jen unplug the Super Nintendo.  As it was being packed 
away, the two reunited friends exchanged addresses and numbers, and 
promised to keep in touch, which was a given considering their hobby.  
Before Terra left the Game Stop, Jen stopped her for one last question 
that had been nagging in her mind.

            &quot;Uh, Terra...do you think I could try out for the soccer 
team as well?&quot;

-- Nadia Khovansky, 19, 5&#39;8&quot; (1.72 m), defensive midfielder position-

            Kasumi Beckett was surprised she managed to book an 
interview with the owner of Out and About so easily, but she wasn&#39;t 
about to question her good fortune.  She had scheduled the meeting with 
Odessa mostly out of curiosity:  she wanted to know just what kind of 
place this nightclub was, and whether she would like it if she got 
hired.  Since she wouldn&#39;t have classes or practice until later, her 
entire day was free, so she could devote it to this interview.  Felicity 
offered to drive her there, but no, Kasumi didn&#39;t want to trouble her, 
and besides, the weather was perfect for a bike ride.  As unfamiliar as 
she was with the new city, Kasumi would need the convenience and 
maneuverability of a bicycle.  Odessa&#39;s directions were pretty good, 
though, and she made it there without incident.  She noted with a smirk 
that there was a place to chain her bike, so she left it behind and made 
sure she had all her credentials.

            &quot;Uh, hello,&quot; she muttered to the bouncer.  The heavyset 
biker butch grinned back, waving a meaty hand.  Kasumi decided to 
identify herself before her intentions were mistaken.  &quot;I&#39;m here for a 
job interview with Odessa.  Is she in right now?&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, her office is on the third floor.  You can&#39;t miss the 
stairs.&quot;

            &quot;Thanks.&quot;  Kasumi slipped inside without fanfare; that 
woman&#39;s stare had discomforted her.  She didn&#39;t think she would feel out 
of place inside the nightclub-she had worked at another gay bar before, 
although that one was usually filled with men-and the fact that the 
floor was very sparsely populated made her feel even easier.  Kasumi was 
glad Odessa didn&#39;t schedule their meeting during peak business hours; 
she wasn&#39;t sure if she could &quot;run the gauntlet&quot; with all those feminine 
eyes gazing at her.

            &quot;Get used to it,&quot; she murmured to herself as she spotted the 
stairs.  &quot;You&#39;re probably going to be working here.  I sure do hope it&#39;s 
different from that other place.&quot;  As Kasumi climbed higher, she noticed 
the lowest area was devoted to a large dance floor and a bar spanning 
from wall to wall; the second floor was a lounge, with tables, beanbag 
chairs, couches, booths, and lots of dark corners and cubbies where 
couples could seclude themselves.  The highest floor was strictly for 
business, where Odessa reigned from on high and where her employees took 
their breaks.  Kasumi dreaded having to hike up and down these stairs 
every day, but there was also an &quot;employees only&quot; entrance that led 
directly outside, which neatly removed that labor from the equation.  
Nice.  She humbly knocked on Odessa&#39;s open door, poking her head inside 
and smiling at the owner.

            &quot;Hi, I&#39;m here for the interview.&quot;

            &quot;Kasumi, right?  Come in, make yourself at home.&quot;  Odessa&#39;s 
office was surprisingly clean, organized, and functional, hardly a 
reflection of its proprietor.  While she was certainly a very beautiful 
woman-short curly black hair crowning her head, silky-smooth brown skin, 
glittering eyes that hinted at the sensuality within, a healthy figure, 
and a smile creasing behind lavender lips-she had a reputation for being 
a wild nymphomaniac.  At least she knew when to separate business from 
pleasure, though she couldn&#39;t help but stare as Kasumi made a strong 
entrance.

            &quot;Well, we may as well get started,&quot; she sighed as they shook 
hands.  &quot;I hate doing it, but I&#39;ve got to see all the legal shit before 
I hire you.  Not my rules, sadly.  Let&#39;s see the ol&#39; r&eacute;sum&eacute;, then.&quot;  
Odessa skipped through it for about a minute and smiled.  &quot;Ah, I see you 
worked at Studs.  I also see you&#39;re not quite twenty-one yet.&quot;

            &quot;Almost,&quot; Kasumi squeaked.  Her pulse skyrocketed, and she 
turned pale.  She had managed to slip by the age limit in her old job by 
coming to an &quot;understanding&quot; with her supervisor, but she didn&#39;t know if 
Odessa would let her off so easily-or if she could call the police about 
this alarming indiscretion.  The older woman just nodded, and gave the 
sheet back.

            &quot;Well, unfortunately, the law also says I can&#39;t employ you 
until you turn twenty-one-that is, if you&#39;re just serving alcohol.  If 
we played by those rules, I wouldn&#39;t be able to hire you until October 
18th.  But lucky for you, I&#39;m the kind of person who&#39;ll take advantage 
of any loophole she can find.  There&#39;s no rule saying I can&#39;t hire 
someone your age to perform any other task!&quot;

            &quot;So you might have something for me after all?&quot; Kasumi 
whispered, feeling hopeful again.  Yes, in spite of her earlier 
misgivings, she felt that this job would be a great success for her.  
After all, she had enjoyed herself more whenever Studs had their &quot;ladies 
nights&quot;, and at Out and About, she would have those same opportunities 
every night.  Not bad.

            &quot;Well, it&#39;s nothing glamorous,&quot; Odessa gestured.  &quot;There&#39;s 
cleaning crew, bouncer-Molly&#39;s going to be moving fairly 
soon-accountant, inventory...hell, you could be a go-go dancer if you 
like.&quot;

            &quot;No thanks,&quot; Kasumi grimaced.  &quot;Actually, I have some 
inventory and data entry experience from my job at Walden&#39;s.  I could 
take that.&quot;  Odessa smiled grimly and shook her head.

            &quot;Nobody ever takes the cleaning jobs.  Well, if your 
previous employer can vouch for you, you&#39;re good in my book.  The job 
starts once I get the green light, so I&#39;ll call you in for orientation.  
Is this your schedule?&quot;  She pointed to a paragraph in Kasumi&#39;s r&eacute;sum&eacute; 
which detailed her school and soccer times.  &quot;Looks like we can work 
around this perfectly.  I guess you&#39;ll be wanting part-time.&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, if you can.&quot;

            &quot;Okay...  Uh, do you drive?&quot;

            &quot;No, I take my bike.&quot;

            &quot;All right, then I don&#39;t have to give you a parking pass.  
Um, since you&#39;ll be up here most of the day, the dress code is business 
casual, but if I transfer you to waitress, you&#39;ll have to wear a 
uniform.  It&#39;s, uh...kind of revealing.  Will that be okay?&quot;

            &quot;Nothing I haven&#39;t done before,&quot; Kasumi muttered.  Odessa 
grinned.

            &quot;Right, right.  Well, I guess that settles things on the 
business end.  There&#39;s a fridge and a freezer in the break room for your 
lunch, and we also have a water cooler and a television.  Most employees 
just go down to the dance floor for their lunch, which is fine.  I&#39;m 
pretty lenient on breaks, but you know...don&#39;t abuse them or anything.  
Any questions?&quot;  Kasumi blushed.  She definitely had questions, far too 
many to ask right now, but settled on something general.

            &quot;Um...so what&#39;s a typical day like here?&quot;

            &quot;Not as crazy as you&#39;d think!&quot; Odessa laughed.  &quot;It&#39;s 
actually pretty orderly for the most part.  We&#39;re closed from 4:30 am to 
4:30 pm, but we don&#39;t get any big crowds until 9:00 or so.  Most of the 
women behave themselves, and we have a strict three-drink limit so 
nobody gets out of control.  We don&#39;t allow any drugs or public sex-mmn, 
that&#39;s what houses are for-and everyone is required to wear a top and a 
bottom, unless it&#39;s Topless Tuesdays, of course.&quot;  Kasumi&#39;s face flashed 
in surprise, and Odessa grinned.  &quot;Yeah, exactly.  That doesn&#39;t upset 
you, I hope.&quot;

            &quot;Uh, no, I mean, it&#39;s just women, right?&quot;

            &quot;Right.  Absolutely no men allowed during business hours.  
If we need an electrician or a plumber, I just schedule them to come in 
before we open.  Most people are cool with this, but there are some 
assholes out there, so that&#39;s why we have Molly.  Any other questions?&quot;

            &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so.  Uh, so when will I know if I have 
the job?&quot;

            &quot;I don&#39;t think you need to worry,&quot; Odessa assured her.  
&quot;It&#39;s just a matter of what your previous employers have to say.  I 
promise I&#39;ll call you once I get in touch with them.&quot;

            &quot;Thanks.  Take care.&quot;

            &quot;You too!&quot;

            Whew.  Kasumi breathed a sigh of relief as she walked 
outside and retrieved her bike.  That wasn&#39;t so hard.

-- Lauren Ofdensen, 22, 5&#39;8&quot; (1.72 m), no position-

            As always, a crowd of women surged in to try their luck on 
the field that afternoon, and as always, Leena judged them very 
carefully.  She could tell that most of them were amateurs like the 
majority of her lineup, but they also lacked the heart and the willpower 
that many in the team possessed.  Only a few had the skills she was 
hoping to find, but many of these were just selfish glory-hogs, people 
that would disgust even Fausta.  The handful that passed her most 
pressing requirements, unfortunately, had schedules that would greatly 
conflict with their training, so she was forced to let them go, hoping 
they would return next year.  Three hours was a long time to be beset by 
disappointments, and when 5:00 approached, even Leena was about ready to 
fall apart.  The worst part was that her wife was not there to support 
her; she was off securing a more stable job.

            A striking young woman with long brunette hair and 
dichromatic eyes approached her with a deliberate, studious pace, 
smiling softly at the exhausted Coach.  Leena perked up a little and 
greeted her.  The brunette then turned her focus to the field, where 
several players were attempting to curry the Coach&#39;s favor.  She watched 
them carefully, tightening her mouth and tapping her fingers against her 
hand.

            &quot;The one in red thinks of nothing but the moment,&quot; she 
murmured softly.  &quot;She is focused like a blade, but she will cut down 
those in her path.  The one in blue jeans is afraid she will be 
rejected, and focuses more on perfection than accomplishment.  She is 
trying too hard.  I like the one with a baggy shirt.  She is very 
accomplished and knows exactly what she is doing.  There is a happy hope 
in her eyes that will not be crushed if you leave her out.  If I were 
you, Coach Leena, I would select her.  As for the others, I believe you 
have your own instincts to listen to.&quot;  The soft smile returned, and the 
mysterious woman bowed.

            &quot;Um...okay...well, I can see how right you are, but I&#39;m not 
sure how you could tell.  Have you been playing sports that long?&quot;

            &quot;No, not at all.  It&#39;s more of a pastime for me.  I don&#39;t 
really have any talent for it.  But reading people is not hard if you 
look for the signs, and I&#39;ve always had a particular gift.  Look, see:  
that one is destructive.  She thinks only of herself.  See how she darts 
around pursuing the ball, thinking only of her fame?  That one over 
there is far too inattentive.  She has many troubling thoughts.  How 
pitiful:  I really only like one person here.&quot;

            &quot;Who are you?&quot; Leena demanded.  Blue and green eyes 
sparkled.

            &quot;A friend of one of your players.  When I learned of her 
inclusion, I came here to witness the spectacle and offer my support.  
I&#39;m not very athletic, Coach Leena, but if you&#39;d like, I can fill in as 
the team psychologist.  It&#39;s fine if you don&#39;t need me, of course-I just 
thought I&#39;d offer my services.&quot;

            &quot;And a valuable service it would be,&quot; she noted jovially, 
thinking about Alice, Nadia, and Felicity.  &quot;You know, when I was 
coaching the Stanton all-girls school, we had a few psychologists 
helping the team out, and it seemed to work pretty well.  I suppose you 
could join the team-providing you give me your name.&quot;

            &quot;Arina Georgette Essylt.  I prefer not to shake hands.&quot;

            &quot;I understand.  Uh, so, you say you&#39;ve played before, 
right?&quot;

            &quot;Yes, but not for long, and I wasn&#39;t particularly good.&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;m just asking in case I need to use you as a reserve.  
Let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t squeeze one more player in before the day&#39;s over.  
Andre, front and center!&quot;

            Jennifer had been having so much fun that she forgot she was 
being monitored.  She jogged over breathlessly, glowing and beautiful, 
not caring whether she made it or not.  Unlike so many others who came 
to try-outs, she didn&#39;t base her self-worth on inclusion or status, but 
by how much love she invested in something, and how much fun she had 
with others.  Of course, when she heard that she had made the cut, she 
was quite overjoyed, but only for all the right reasons.  Arina smiled 
at her; she liked Jen already.

            But that was not quite the end.  Right around 5:30, when 
Leena dismissed everyone and started to pack up, a shadow fell over her 
and she looked to see which latecomer had arrived.  She wasn&#39;t in the 
mood to judge anybody, and didn&#39;t exactly look forward to coming back 
tomorrow for another tribulation.  But the instant she saw who was 
towering over her, standing still and quiet as a post, her face lit up 
and she grinned.

            &quot;Well hello there!  You must be Alice Hawthorne!  Goodness, 
you really are tall!  Sit down, sit down, make yourself comfortable!&quot;

            &quot;No thanks,&quot; murmured the giantess, &quot;I won&#39;t be long.  It 
looks like you&#39;ve had a busy day.&quot;

            &quot;Ugh, yeah, three hours of watching wannabe stars scurry 
around fighting each other.  I swear, I must&#39;ve landed in one of those 
awful reality shows.  Did you just get here?&quot;  Alice shook her head, her 
dyed-black hair shivering.

            &quot;Uh...to tell you the truth...I&#39;ve sort of been watching 
everything.  I, uh, wanted to see what things were like.&quot;

            &quot;Oh?  So what do you think?&quot;  Alice smiled feebly, hunching 
over to make herself appear smaller.  At 6&#39;4&quot; (1.93 meters), this was 
hard for any woman to do, but Alice was a diagnosed schizophrenic; she 
seemed destined to draw people&#39;s stares.

            &quot;It&#39;s nice.&quot;

            &quot;So would it be too forward of me to ask if you&#39;ve come to a 
decision yet?&quot;

            &quot;No,&quot; she answered, shaking her head again.  &quot;I&#39;ve 
definitely made my choice.&quot;  Leena was kind enough to wait for the 
answer; she didn&#39;t want to put any more pressure on her delicate psyche.  
Alice needed those few seconds of peace to finally come to terms with 
her real desires.

            I probably won&#39;t make any friends, or help win any games, or 
do anything that&#39;s worth meriting.  I doubt if I&#39;ll even be able to get 
anything out of this.  But if I want a cure...if I want to be normal 
again...I have to try, don&#39;t I?

            &quot;Coach Leena,&quot; she announced in a firm voice, &quot;I want to 
join the Carnegie soccer team!&quot;

            The older woman smiled and shook her hand.

            &quot;Welcome aboard.&quot;
