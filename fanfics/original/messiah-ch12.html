Chronicle Twelve - all hail the Kamiyashiki 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Wait a minute... is that... the Bishamon...?&quot;

Yumi was stunned. There was simply no way that it could have been the 
Bishamon. And yet it looked just like it. The same colour and plates of 
armour, a similar Energy Katana (though this one seemed to be a little 
bit longer that the previous) and aside from a few differences in shape 
and height; that machine looked exactly like the old Bishamon M-2. But 
how could that have been possible if Yumi had been trapped inside that 
sphere of her own Qi for 6000 years? It just wasn&#39;t possible. No matter 
what the reasons, Yumi stood with Tomoko and stared up at the three 
Modified-Zagans that were hovering forty metres up above the city of 
Troas. 

They had called themselves the &#39;Blue Fire Gang&#39; and had their guns aimed 
at the townsfolk. They had also declared that the village hand over all 
its food to them so that they could &#39;protect&#39; Troas from Ashurian 
Subjugation. And now the only thing standing between them and the people 
was that Bishamon Meta Suit. When the Bishamon came down from the skies 
above, the three members of the Blue Fire Gang turned all their 
attention to it and aimed their guns for fire. 

The first pilot yelled, &quot;Who the hell are you!?&quot;

And the pilot of Bishamon made no reply. 

Then the pilot of Modified Zagan #2 chuckle. &quot;...Oh? The silent type, 
eh? It doesn&#39;t really matter. We&#39;ll still kill this guy! Are you with 
me, boys!? Lets show him what it means to meddle in the Blue Fire Gang&#39;s 
business!&quot;

The pilots of Modified Zagans #3 and #1 yelled in agreement and then all 
three suits charged at the Bishamon in union. This Bishamon itself did 
not move from that point. It waited where it was for the attacks that 
were sure to come from them. And all three Modified Zagans fired their 
beam rifles in rapid succession. The Bishamon ignited its thrusters and 
jetted up into the air even further. Moving with a far superior 
manoeuvrability to the old Meta Suits of Yumi&#39;s time. It bolted higher 
into the air and sailed above the gunshots from the three attackers. 
Once it reached a new height, the pilots of the Modified Zagans all 
blasted up their with their own thrusters. Yumi watched this and knew 
what the pilot was thinking He was probably trying to the fight away 
from the villagers below in the Troas streets. 

The first of the Modified Zagans rushed at the Bishamon to attack. But 
this was the point at which the Bishamon&#39;s pilot altered his strategy. 
The right metal hand of the Samurai mecha reached back and grabbed onto 
the hilt of the Energy Katana that was sheathed on its back. It gripped 
the blade and then withdrew it in one clean action. The 42-metre long 
sword glistened with sheen upon freedom. Then the Bishamon used its 
awesome power. With one searing stroke it sliced downwards and cut the 
attacking Zagan in half. With a stroke so swift that neither of the 
other Blue Fire Gang members had caught onto it on time. Modified Zagan 
#1&#39;s two halves exploded with each other in that instant. While Bishamon 
swung its body around and turned to Modified Zagan #3. The shoulder 
plates on its red Japanese-style armour opened up. And two turrets 
extended from that same point Those Shoulder Gatlings then began 
twirling with rapid fire. Hundreds of bullets were shot into the steel 
torso of Modified Zagan #3 at incredible speeds. And moments later that 
same force blew the suits into oblivion. Which just left one last thing 
to take care of. Modified Zagan #2. The pilot of the suit soon knew what 
position he was in. But like the fool that he was, he made no attempt to 
run. Rather he re-aimed with his laser cannon and fired continuously at 
the Bishamon. Now, using more of that enhanced Anthropos Era speed, the 
Bishamon cut past all that mess, darting from one side to the other of 
the line of fire. Once it was close enough it thrust its Energy Katana 
into the body of the last of the Modified Zagans. The moment that the 
Bishamon pulled its sword out, it flew backwards to avoid the following 
explosion. One so loud and forceful that the people of Troas had to 
cover their ears before erupting with cheer.

All three suits had been destroyed. And the pilot didn&#39;t even seem to 
have been trying very hard. Tomoko crossed her arms and stared at the 
suit from below, with a kind of authoritative/proud look on her face.

&quot;Good job,&quot; She said coolly, &quot;...Skye must have told you to come...&quot;

Yumi pointed at the suit but glared at Tomoko. &quot;...Do you know who&#39;s 
piloting that suit?!&quot;

&quot;Of course I do.&quot;

&quot;Then who is it?!&quot; 

&quot;Ask him yourself,&quot; Tomoko said, shrugging, &quot;Here he comes.&quot;

Just as Geist Fahlem and Lune exited the restaurant to see what the 
commotion was, the Bishamon started to land in the park that Yumi and 
Tomoko were standing in. The owners of the shopping stalls all clamoured 
around their merchandise to stop it from being blown away. The exhaust 
of the Bishamon&#39;s large thrusters lessened when it came down to ground 
level. The loud sound of landing came thereafter when its feet touched 
upon the grass just twenty metres ahead of Yumi and Tomoko Fahlem and 
Lune came up behind them but said nothing. And just looked up at the red 
Meta Suit that was standing before them. The automatic doors leading 
into the opening of the cockpit soon unlocked and slowly parted for the 
brave occupier. That young man stepped out of the cockpit and jumped out 
to deftly land on the grasslands below him. A blonde-haired youngster 
with partly American and partly Germanic origins Dressed comfortably in 
a pair of stonewash jeans and a brown leather bomber jacket, with a 
white logo on the back that stated &#39;Madman&#39;. The youth tossed his 
ponytail over his shoulder, turned his plum-coloured eyes to Tomoko and 
gave her a cocky thumbs up.

&quot;How&#39;s that, boss?&quot;

Tomoko uncrossed her arms. &quot;You certainly took your time! But you got 
the job done in the end. This should free up enough money for us to keep 
moving towards North Horan, right?&quot;

Yumi was completely oblivious to the conversation that they were having. 
Her wide blue eyes remained locked on the pilot of the Bishamon. The one 
who just jumped down from it in all his glory. Terry Hennig. Yumi&#39;s 
expression went from one of sheer surprise to one of unbridled joy. Her 
eyes watered over instantly. And before she was even aware of it, Yumi 
was running to him. Still stumbled across the path between the two of 
them but she didn&#39;t care. All she cared about was this. Her best friend 
was alive. Yumi threw herself into a startled Terry&#39;s arms and sobbed 
instantly, overcome by emotion.

&quot;Oh God, Terry!&quot; She yelled, &quot;I thought you were dead! I really thought 
you were dead! Doctor Fahlem told me that everyone on the Leviathan had 
been killed and I thought... I thought... oh Terry, I&#39;m so sorry...&quot;

Terry looked down upon Yumi with some slight confusion, but Tomoko was 
the one most curious about this turn of events. She strode up to the 
pair of them with an angry, questioning glare. Exchanging glances 
between the joyful Yumi and the slightly bewildered Terry Then she 
grabbed onto the older man&#39;s collar with a tight fist.

&quot;...You jerk!&quot; She bellowed irately, &quot;Are you sleeping with her?! What 
about Skye!?&quot;

Terry waved his hands in defence. &quot;Of course not! I swear to God! She 
just came up and started hugging me! I don&#39;t know her from Adam!&quot;

&quot;Huh...?&quot; Yumi expressed, looking up tearfully from Terry&#39;s shoulder.

The slightly older boy grabbed Yumi by the shoulders and slowly pushed 
her back from him. &quot;...Look, um... I&#39;m sorry, Miss. But I&#39;m already in a 
relationship... and... I don&#39;t make a point of jumping into bed with 
every stranger that comes up and hugs me... even if she does know my 
name.&quot;

Yumi blinked &quot;...Terry... you don&#39;t... remember me?&quot;

&quot;...Should I?&quot;

&quot;But on the Leviathan you said... that you loved me...&quot;

Tomoko&#39;s eyes hardened. &quot;You ARE sleeping with her, damnit!&quot;

The blonde youth&#39;s shoulders sagged with exasperation. Then he turned 
his attention back on Yumi once more. &quot;...Listen, Miss I guess we must 
have known each other from some time before... but I have someone I&#39;m 
with now. You seem to be a nice enough girl, but...&quot;

Yumi shook her head from one side to the other. &quot;...You don&#39;t remember 
me, do you?&quot;

&quot;...Not... really...&quot;

&quot;But what about EDEN?&quot; Yumi prodded, &quot;You were fighting to protect it 
and its people, remember? And the Leviathan and the crew of Chrysalis? 
The way your parents died? Protocol? General Naam? Can&#39;t you recall any 
of it at all...?&quot;

Terry simply shrugged. &quot;Sorry. Doesn&#39;t ring a bell.&quot;

That was it. Yumi&#39;s hands lowered from Terry&#39;s shoulders in a slow, 
dejected way. Terry didn&#39;t even remember her. After all they had been 
through in their days as partners of the Chrysalis militia, he didn&#39;t 
recognize her at all. There were more important questions she should 
have been asking. Like just how was it that Terry was able to survive 
for 6000 years after the Divine Cataclysm. Or why he had no memory of 
her. Yumi&#39;s brief bit of happiness faded away as though it had never 
been there at all. While Tomoko looked at Yumi from the side of her eye. 
There was something going on here. And Tomoko seemed to be picking up on 
it.

The short-haired teen ruffled her hair. &quot;Alrighty then. I suppose we&#39;ve 
got an issue here. And I&#39;m not the type to leave something unfinished. 
Yumi? Are you here on your own?&quot;

&quot;...No...&quot;

Tomoko pressed her hand onto her hip. &quot;Okay. Then go get your friends 
and we&#39;ll clear this all up. It&#39;s time you met up with the Kamiyashiki.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

For the second time in 24 hours, a plane was descending from the sky to 
the northern runway of the St. Mary&#39;s Base of Western Horan. It was a 
plane that had flown all the way from South Shidou, or more specifically 
it had flown from the South Shidou Investigate Research Station. Inside 
its large hull was a very important cargo which was now being treated 
with a  code red importance. That cargo happened to be the Oriax. 
Alongside the plane flew an accompanying custom-made Meta Suit. One that 
had been flying with the cargo ship to protect it until it reached St. 
Mary&#39;s base. That Meta Suit was known as Hanuman. Its armour was painted 
a dark black. With rigid proportions to its arms and chest to give it 
the impression of muscles. A huge mane of decorative horse hair extended 
from the skull of the Hanuman all the way to its back. In its hand was 
an elongated Meta Suit-size Naginata. On that was remotely linked to the 
Qi Generator of the mecha. That was the Hanuman.

And the Hanuman was piloted by none other than Aratia de Toscana. 

Hanuman and the cargo ship descended for the runway when they neared the 
St. Mary&#39;s Base. They both landed safely, Hanuman coming down at a 
faster speed that the plane. This brought the incoming party to the 
middle of the northern runway Where a few people were waiting for them. 
Once the feet of Hanuman touched the ground, its stomach cockpit doors 
opened up for the pilot, Aratia, to exit. Which she did. The girl jumped 
from the opened cockpit and came down to the ground level gridiron. Two 
of the people waiting for Aratia and the cargo ship were Diana Katrianna 
and Doctor Mien. Behind them were four armed security guards. Security 
was always tight around these research facilities owed to the Ashurian 
Empire. Though the scientific aspect of this particular base was just 
one of its specialities, St. Mary&#39;s was no exception to the rule. Aratia 
ran a hand through her bangs and stared on at the two scientists waiting 
for her.

&quot;Here is it,&quot; The feisty Ashurian soldier said, &quot;that old Meta Suit you 
people kept badgering me for. Indulge yourselves.&quot;

Diana took a special note of this one, smiling. &quot;Aratia de Toscana You 
are one of the three members of the Shinjinkai, the star pilots of 
Schutzenreich It&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

Aratia scratched the side of her head while some of the worker began to 
unload the Oriax from the hull of the cargo ship. &quot;...Have we met?&quot;

&quot;...How soon they forget,&quot; Diana suggested, &quot;I am Diana Katrianna. 
Leader of the scientific team known better to you as the Ministry of 
Metaphysical and Biotechnological Neo-Eugenic Research. The same team 
that was behind the creation of the Hanuman. As well as the muscle 
enhancers that have increased the physical strength of the Schutzenreich 
soldiers. That suit you were piloting is one of my earlier creations. I 
see you have made some modifications.&quot;

Aratia scowled. &quot;I know you. You&#39;re that chick from Aryahm who built 
those damn Stolas Marionettes.&quot;

Doctor Mien frowned at Aratia&#39;s lack of respect, but Diana simply smiled 
with that calm, cool aura; unfazed. &quot;I take it that you are not an 
aficionado of the unmanned Marionettes?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a soldier&#39;s duty to fight,&quot; Aratia barked, &quot;I don&#39;t need a 
computer system doing that job for me.  I didn&#39;t get to where I am now 
by relying on some piss-ass super AI. I do my job damn well.&quot;

The older woman opened her eyes. &quot;And you would say that my creations 
interfere with your role as a soldier? I find that to be an interesting 
point of view. And also one that I cannot share. You see... you may have 
a point in saying that the Marionettes forsake the role of soldiers in 
battle. But I do not use that machinery. I only design and create it. 
Its overall use is determined by the will of its intended owners. Take 
that Hanuman for example. I may have created it. But I can&#39;t be blamed 
for the lives that it has taken during activation. Because I am not the 
one who either uses or owns it. That is you. And in the case of the 
Marionettes, that is Gustav K&#148;hler, the leader of the Schutzenreich. The 
role of the weapon is determined by the hand and mind of the user. And 
since Commander K&#148;hler is, by your unceremonious description, a soldier, 
and the will of the soldier is shared by all those who call themselves 
such... wouldn&#39;t that suggest that the problem you are expressing is 
internal? It is as many say One&#39;s greatest enemy is found most often 
within themselves In which case... what right do you have to blame the 
creator for the changes forced upon you by the weapon that person 
created? Isn&#39;t that... for lack of a better definition... running away 
from yourself?&quot;

Aratia stood silently with a mixed expression of anger and realization 
on her face. One that caused Diana&#39;s smile to widen. Especially when she 
put forth, &quot;There are two sides to every coin, Miss Toscana. A person 
can judge or be judged by either of those sides. I am not so 
unbelievably arrogant that I could presume to tell you that the 
impending obsolete nature of your position is completely unconnected to 
me. But neither am I so self-critical that I could allow myself to be 
blamed for the way your superiors use my technology I am a scientist. It 
is my role to discover. What people do with my discoveries and how they 
use them is not my concern.&quot;

&quot;Is that right?!&quot; Aratia said, clutching her fist

Diana merely chuckled. &quot;Correct. Now as much I would love to continue 
this discussion I have much work to do upon the Oriax. While you are 
stationed at St. Mary&#39;s you are obligated to follow my orders. Thus you 
will remain on standby until further notice. Do you understand?&quot;

Aratia&#39;s growl could have been heard from miles away. She had serious 
problems with authority below Queen Ashura, the only woman that the 
blonde vixen pledged true fealty to; but she had no choice in this 
matter. Orders were orders 

Aratia exhaled a calming breath and replied, &quot;...Whatever.&quot;

With that; Diana bid Aratia a last smile and strode over to the cargo 
ship that the Oriax was being removed from by the hands of over twenty 
Chuggers. Aratia watched her walk off and glared at the older woman.

&quot;What a bitch,&quot; She muttered, &quot;Man, I hate scientists.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;...So you&#39;re... bounty hunters...?&quot;

The battleship &#39;Kamiyashiki&#39;.

At a total length of over 160 metres and an overall width of little 
under 68 metres, weighing more than 340 tonnes made up of pure steel. It 
was definitely smaller and less well equipped with comparison to the 
Chrysalis battleship, Leviathan; but it certainly was worthy of the 
comparison. The Kamiyashiki was very large in its own way. Large enough 
to contain its own Meta Suit hanger which could house more than ten 
suits But considering the size of the Kamiyashiki, it was rather 
undermanned. There were not many people on board for something of this 
size.  Geist Fahlem was quite taken by the ship in any case. And Lune 
had found herself to be very impressed But she had spent most of her 
life in a prison... so seeing this kind of thing was bound to be 
impressive to her. Yumi was less thrown by the ship and more concerned 
with the pilot of the Bishamon. The man who she had thought to be her 
best friend. Terry Hennig. But Yumi was not ignoring the questions that 
were popping up in her mind now. Ones that were more glaring than 
before. Like how Terry managed to survive the Divine Cataclysm and live 
on for another 6000 years without growing a day older in looks. And why 
he had no memory of the past. No memory of Yumi or the love he once felt 
for her.

The group had gathered at the head of the Kamiyashiki. The bridge. Just 
the kind of bridge you would expect for such a ship. It was circular, 
built with a platform for the captain of the ship to command from. 
Standing on that bridge platform now was Tomoko, Terry, Yumi, Fahlem and 
Lune. While the surrounded computers were manned by three people that 
were as yet; unknown to the visitors. Though one of those people kept a 
glance on Terry every few minutes.

Tomoko nodded. &quot;Yup. Though I don&#39;t like to think of my crew as a bunch 
of bounty hunters. I prefer to think of us as... &#39;pirates&#39;.&quot;

&quot;But that... really isn&#39;t the case... is it?&quot;

&quot;Geez, man,&quot; Tomoko sighed, her shoulders sagging, &quot;Can&#39;t you at least 
humour me? But... yeah... I guess the best way to classify us is as a 
band of bounty hunters. You see we take on jobs for people for a set 
price and then carry &#39;um out. Once we get paid... we move on. It&#39;s kind 
of a rootless existence, that&#39;s for damn sure, but that&#39;s the way we 
operate That&#39;s the way Tomoko Minaba works.&quot;

Fahlem held a hand to his chin. &quot;...Tomoko Minaba? As in the Jaankang 
Minaba Family? Are you... the daughter of Yoshinori Minaba?&quot;

Tomoko&#39;s expression hardened. &quot;...You know about my Dad?&quot;

&quot;A small amount,&quot; He replied, &quot;...I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be. That was a long time ago. I don&#39;t hold grudges. Life&#39;s too 
short for them. Anyways, that&#39;s enough about us. I didn&#39;t bring you 
three to this ship so you could hear me gas on about my own life. 
Introduce yourselves and explain to me... just what you&#39;re doing here.&quot;

Fahlem smiled at Tomoko. It really wasn&#39;t her place to be questioning 
them like this. But she had a very powerful form of confidence that 
seemed a bit foreign to this day and age. And he knew, even from then, 
that that same confidence would do wonders around someone like Yumi. But 
for now, he only answered the question &quot;...My name is Geist Fahlem. I am 
travelling with Yumi and Lune.&quot;

Tomoko crossed her arms and looked over at Lune. &quot;Well I already know 
who Yumi is so that must make you Lune. Right?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh!&quot; Said the chirpy girl. 

The young captain of the Kamiyashiki smiled confidently. &quot;Okay then. 
Since you&#39;re on the ship now... I guess I can be straight up with you. 
My crew is made of about twelve people. The three helms people below us 
are from right to left; Neela, Suzuhara, and our chief engineer himself, 
Skye K&#148;hler.&quot;

Again Geist was astounded. &quot;Wait a moment. Skye K&#148;hler? Aren&#39;t you the 
grandson of Commander Gustav K&#148;hler, the leader of Aryahm and the 
Schutzenreich?&quot;

The eighteen-year-old boy, the short-haired Skye K&#148;hler, the one who had 
been exchanging glances with Terry; was that same person. Skye sighed 
gently from his sitting position on the chair and swivelled around on it 
until he was facing the platform that his leader was standing on. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; He said dispassionately.

Terry rested his palms behind his head. &quot;...Skye doesn&#39;t talk much... 
but yeah, that&#39;s the deal. Now that you know where he is... and who he 
is... I expect you to keep it a secret.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Fahlem assured, &quot;I will speak no more of the issue.&quot;

Skye turned back around on his chair, facing the control panel of the 
ship. But not before throwing one longing glance in Terry&#39;s direction. 
Terry noticed it and gave him a warm smile; one that seemed to say &#39;it&#39;s 
okay&#39;. A form of reassurance. Skye pulled a tiny smile from that... 
knowing that he was safe with Terry looking out for his best interests. 
Fahlem noted it. And he was beginning to understand a bit more about 
Gustav&#39;s nature... from taking such an observation. 

Tomoko piped up again. &quot;Alright, enough about Skye. He hates attention I 
need to know what you people are planning on doing.&quot;

&quot;And what does that mean?&quot; Geist wondered. 

&quot;Oh don&#39;t play dumb with me, Doctor Fahlem. You look too smart for it. I 
studied the Properties of Qi as a subject in college no less than a year 
ago. I can sense when someone has high affinity with the stuff All three 
of you are practically swimming in it. So explain yourselves.&quot;

&quot;...What&#39;s this... Qi thing?&quot; Lune asked, blinking. 

&quot;...I suppose I should say something,&quot; Geist answered, &quot;Lune, Qi is the 
life force of all living things The substance that fuels the engine of 
life. All are bound to it in some shape and form. You happen to possess 
a large amount of that energy.&quot;

Lune still didn&#39;t understand, but... &quot;...Okay...&quot;

&quot;Hey, are you gonna answer me?&quot; Tomoko prodded, &quot;Come on, what&#39;s your 
deal? I know that you&#39;re more than just travellers. So spit it out.&quot; 

Fahlem pushed his glasses up the bridge of his nose. &quot;Very well. I 
cannot tell you everything until I can be sure that you are all 
trustworthy. But for the most part you should know that we are on the 
run from the Ashurian Empire And soon they will be coming for us.&quot;

&quot;Runaways, eh?&quot; Tomoko evaluated, &quot;I got it. So what did you do?&quot;

Geist shook his head. &quot;Like I told you. I cannot supply you with all the 
information until I am sure you can be trusted. And that depends now on 
the answer you give me.&quot;

&quot;To what?&quot; Asked Terry.

&quot;There is a certain Meta Suit,&quot; The doctor started, &quot;called the Oriax. 
That suit belongs to Yumi. And our main agenda right now is to get that 
suit back. As you have stated that you carry out missions... I must 
ask... will you help us to retrieve the Oriax?&quot;

Tomoko scratched her nose in thought. &quot;Messing with the Ashurians, eh? 
That can be big business if you don&#39;t know who you&#39;re dealing with. 
D&#39;you know the power they have at their hands?&quot;

&quot;Of course I do,&quot; Fahlem said seriously, &quot;and to a far greater degree 
than even you, Miss Minaba.&quot;

&quot;Alright, alright, keep your pants on. I&#39;m just saying that the 
Ashurians don&#39;t kid around with this kind of shit Anyways, we&#39;ll take on 
any job offered to us. But we don&#39;t come cheap. Unless you&#39;ve got 
200,000 extra credits laying around this thing&#39;s over.&quot;

Fahlem bobbed his head to her. &quot;It&#39;s a deal. I can give you the money 
soon enough. But this mission will be dangerous. Can I trust that your 
people will be brave enough to handle it?&quot;

Terry grinned at the Ishtar. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t underestimate us, doc. We can 
handle ourselves. My Bishamon M-4 is more than enough to see me through 
any kind of fight. Besides. If this Oriax thing is a new model then I&#39;d 
love to check it out.&quot;

Fahlem smiled at that. &quot;Well... I wouldn&#39;t classify it as a &#39;new model&#39; 
but its overall capabilities are quite staggering. But if that is your 
wish then I am sure you will be pleased when you lay your eyes upon it.&quot;

&quot;Okay then, so it&#39;s agreed,&quot; Tomoko clarified, &quot;My crew will help you 
get this Oriax suit for a fee of 200,000 bucks. Now we need a few 
details about the mission itself. Exactly where is the Oriax and how do 
you want us to go about getting it back...?&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Towards the upper rear level of the Kamiyashiki was a large recreational 
hall. It was full of the usual stuff you&#39;d expect to find in such a 
place. Circular coffee tables, pool tables, wall posters and framed 
pictures, vending machines for carbonised beverages, candy bars, 
sandwiches and coffees, as well as three plush sofas formatted around a 
wide screen TV which picked up a great deal of channels via illegal 
radio wave receptors. It was the kind of place that you&#39;d expect bounty 
hunters to rest and relax in. Since so few people were manning so large 
a ship, it was quite empty aside from one person. And that person was 
Yumi. She stood by the bullet proof glass that made up the hall&#39;s rear 
window. From there she could look out unto the land that the Kamiyashiki 
was flying over. The green fields and plains of Horan. They were heading 
north west, to a place in Horan called the St Mary&#39;s Base. Somehow 
Fahlem knew that the Oriax was being taken there by the Ashurian Empire. 
Although that was something that Yumi could not focus on. When she 
looked out through the window she was not seeing the grasslands of 
Horan; she was just thinking about all that had happened to get her to 
this point. Seeing Terry... or whoever he was... had done nothing but 
remind Yumi of how alone she felt. Yumi had been alone ever since her 
father was killed by Protocol agents. Though she was in a coma for five 
years after that, when she awoke she was on her own. It was only when 
Yumi joined Chrysalis that she started to feel... like she had found a 
place to belong to. With Sophia and Terry and everyone else... Yumi 
didn&#39;t feel alone 

But now...

Yumi felt more lonely than ever before. Not only had her friends all 
died, but the world around her was warped beyond belief. She had no 
home, no friends, no family, no money, no job, no security, and no hopes 
or ideas as to what to do now. The only thing keeping her going was the 
thought of Geist Fahlem better explaining things when they got to Geshem 
with the Oriax. But once she learned her truths... what would Yumi do 
then? It wasn&#39;t like she could re-write history and go back to the 
Leviathan. This was her life from now on. This empty life of loneliness 
and sadness was hers and hers alone. 

The automatic door on the other side of the recreation room opened. And 
the captain of the ship and its crew, Tomoko, stepped through it. She 
pulled a smile when she saw the girl, but that smile lessened when she 
also saw Yumi&#39;s shoulders tremble. She was about to cry.

&quot;...Hey,&quot; Tomoko called out, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

Yumi held back her tears. &quot;...I&#39;m... fine...&quot;

&quot;...You know... when people say &#39;I&#39;m fine&#39; as a reply to &#39;are you okay&#39; 
it usually means &#39;I&#39;m NOT fine&#39;. So... you wanna talk about it?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;...Oh. Okay then.&quot; Tomoko shrugged her shoulders and walked up to the 
same window that Yumi was now facing. She stopped when she and Yumi were 
side to side. They stood their like that for no less than seven minutes 
Until Yumi actually turned her head and looked at her. 

Tomoko did the same seconds afterwards. &quot;...What?&quot;

&quot;...Are you... just...&quot;

&quot;...Am I just going to stand here?&quot; She filled in, &quot;It is my ship, after 
all.&quot;

The Japanese girl cast her eyes downwards. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Geez, do you do that often?&quot;

&quot;Do what?&quot;

&quot;Apologize for things that you don&#39;t need to apologize for?&quot;

&quot;...I...&quot; Yumi was lost for words, &quot;...well...&quot;

Tomoko closed her eyes with a smile. &quot;...I used to know someone just 
like you, you know...&quot;

&quot;...W-who...?&quot; Yumi wondered 
 
&quot;My Father.&quot;

&quot;...Your Father...?&quot;

&quot;...He...&quot; Tomoko crossed her arms before continuing, &quot;...was a 
politician. In Jaankang The post of Prime Minister was abandoned years 
ago but that was the best word to describe him. Jaankang has a history 
of conflict with its neighbour, the nation of Shengong. After the last 
war between the two, about eighty years ago, relations have been frayed. 
And the &#39;wonderful&#39; world of politics in Jaankang were pretty much 
screwed from then on. I mean don&#39;t get me wrong. It makes sense to me 
that my Dad wouldn&#39;t have had an easy time of it,  but...&quot;

Yumi watched the seriousness in Tomoko&#39;s face. &quot;...What...?&quot;

&quot;...I didn&#39;t think people would go THAT far against him. Say, do you 
know what Aryahm is?&quot;

Yumi shook her head for a no.

So Tomoko explained it. &quot;Aryahm is a gigantic city-sized nation created 
by the Ashurian Empire for the purpose of gaining a foothold on the 
world. It was created quite a few years ago but it&#39;s purpose has never 
changed And when they started getting involved in the affairs of the 
surface world... the bigwigs in Aryahm tried to expand their influence 
to the East. Shengong was the first to sell out of course. They knew 
that the Ashurian Empire was a force to be reckoned with. The Xu-Canaan 
War pretty much clarified that little detail for everyone. So when the 
Ashurian power-base in Shengong tried to expand their power into 
Jaankang... my Dad tried to stop them. He appealed to the people that 
they had to resist the Ashurians through non violent means. Most of them 
agreed with him of course. They didn&#39;t like the Ashurian Empire anymore 
than the next nation did. But at the end of the day... the people don&#39;t 
make the rules. They follow them So that Gustav K&#148;hler bastard told 
parliament that if they didn&#39;t accept Ashurian influence politically 
then they&#39;d use force. Even I knew that Jaankang could not risk a war 
with the Ashurians. But before my Dad even had the chance to tell them 
that... he was killed.&quot;

Yumi looked on. &quot;...Murdered?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Tomoko said calmly, &quot;a sole woman blew his brains out with a 
single bullet. Right in front of me and my Mom. Of course she did a 
runner and I hear she&#39;s hooked up with some member of Parliament. Which 
is a bit of a kick in the crotch when you consider the fact that it was 
Parliament that levied the assassination of my Dad They were afraid that 
he wouldn&#39;t cave into the pressure and would attempt to resist the 
Ashurians by force, the wankers. So they ordered someone to kill him. I 
can&#39;t remember her face all that well... but... whatever. Like I told 
your friend, Geist... I&#39;ve gone past all that.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m so sorry, Tomoko.&quot; Said Yumi.

The taller girl grinned. &quot;Hey, didn&#39;t I tell you to stop apologizing? 
You didn&#39;t know my Dad. You and he might be a lot alike but that doesn&#39;t 
mean you have to feel sorry about the things that happened to him.&quot;

&quot;...I wasn&#39;t thinking of him...&quot; Yumi admitted, &quot;...I was thinking of 
you.&quot;

Tomoko&#39;s smile widened. &quot;...Really?&quot;

&quot;...Yes. I know... how lonely... it is... to... have no parents...&quot;

That wasn&#39;t really the direction that Tomoko was heading to with her own 
thoughts, but... it was nice that Yumi thought like that. Tomoko really 
couldn&#39;t stand it when people apologized for situations that didn&#39;t 
actually involve them. &quot;...You lost your parents too?&quot;

&quot;My adoptive father was killed... just as yours was I don&#39;t really have 
any biological... parents. Since then I&#39;ve been alone. Then when I 
joined the crew of the Leviathan all that changed... it was different. I 
was starting to become happy. Why... did this have to happen...? Why did 
I have to be bought to this place? Why didn&#39;t I die along with them...?&quot;

Tomoko frowned at that. &quot;...You can&#39;t wish for death.&quot;

&quot;Why not?!&quot; Yumi barked suddenly, the tears dripping from her eyes, &quot;I 
spent my whole life regretting the fact that I&#39;m alive! And the one time 
when I can truly say that I was happy... was taken away from me! What&#39;s 
the point of living when that happens?! What&#39;s the point in that?!&quot;

&quot;You just keep going.&quot;

&quot;Why should I? There&#39;s a knife over there, right?! Why don&#39;t I just 
slash my wrists and be done with it!?&quot;

Tomoko&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;I said stop talking like that.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t help it! I should have been there! I should have been there to 
protect them from Rain! And where was I?! I was off fulfilling some 
stupid promise to the man who raped me! The man who murdered the Saffron 
Family and turned Rain into the Deathcatcher! If I had stayed with them 
I could have protected them! I could have stopped Rain from doing what 
he did! That means all those people who died... all those who 
suffered... it&#39;s all my fault...! It&#39;s all my fault! And yet I&#39;m still 
alive!&quot;

&quot;...Stop it, Yumi...&quot; Tomoko whispered

The white-haired teen clutched her hands into fists and her body shook 
visibly, all the while her tears dripped down her cheeks. &quot;...I don&#39;t 
deserve to call them my friends. What kind of friend am I if I put my 
own issues ahead of theirs? And what better proof do I need to show I 
should be dead...?&quot;

&quot;...Stop it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a coward,&quot; Yumi remarked scathingly, &quot;and I&#39;m worthless...&quot;

Tomoko closed her eyes in frustration. &quot;I said stop it!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t deserve life... not when I couldn&#39;t save the lives of those who 
meant the most to me And now they&#39;re all dead because of me! Because of 
what I did! What I am! I hate myself!&quot;

But by that time Tomoko had heard enough. The dark-haired woman faced 
Yumi and grabbed her by the shoulders, without any sort of constraint or 
confusion. &quot;You&#39;re gonna stop this right now! I&#39;m not gonna hear 
anymore, you get me? I don&#39;t give a damn about what happened in your 
past! The past is the past! Bitching about it to kingdom come isn&#39;t 
gonna bring back the people you lost and it isn&#39;t gonna change what 
happened! But that doesn&#39;t mean you can give up! D&#39;you think that those 
people you knew would wanna see you like this?! I&#39;ve never met any of 
them and I know that the answer&#39;s no! They&#39;d want you to keep living for 
them! And I know that because I know that my would Dad have wanted the 
same for me! So you can&#39;t give up! Doing so really would make you 
worthless...!&quot;

Yumi and Tomoko stared into each other. The valiant Tomoko&#39;s powerful 
auburn orbs locking with those of Yumi&#39;s tearful sky blue. And Yumi knew 
what Tomoko was saying to be true. But losing the crew hurt her so much. 

&quot;...I miss them... so much, Tomoko...&quot; Yumi whispered softly, between 
her muffled sobs, &quot;...and I&#39;ll never see them again...&quot;

&quot;...Hey... come here, okay?&quot;

Tomoko opened her arms for Yumi and the hacker collapsed into them. 
Expressing the full scope of her sadness. She cried and poured her heart 
out, her held rested on Tomoko&#39;s shoulder. The older woman held Yumi 
close and just stroked her snow white hair with her free hand. She knew 
how much it hurt to lose people in life. And from the looks of Yumi... 
she had experienced much pain in that respect. But she had to keep on 
living for the people she&#39;d lost. And though Tomoko didn&#39;t quite realize 
it at that point...

...it was going to be a personal quest of hers to keep Yumi that way.
