**********

&quot;Good work, team,&quot; Commander Eldiah said, &quot;things went by smoothly.&quot;

Three hours had passed since the completion of the mission that the 
Darshana Division had been given. They had used three of its field 
operatives, Ashriel Gestalt, Kathleen &#39;Cream&#39; Stenzel and Yoko Daitokuji 
to carry out the mission. And they had successfully taken the human test 
sample from the Protea Research Facility before the Saviours overran it. 
Now the three of them had returned to the Paracelsus with that boy in 
their grasp. The first thing they did was take him to the infirmary. 
Which was where they all were now (or at least some of them were). The 
boy had been redressed in some Darshana Division casual wear. Just a 
green and gold over-shirt and some denims. But he had not awakened since 
he had been liberated from the test tube he had been found in. Cream 
kneeled beside his bed and stared at the boy, curiously, while the older 
Yoko and the even older Commander Eldiah stood at the foot of the bed.

Yoko nodded, staring at some of the empty beds beside this one. &quot;Thank 
you, sir.&quot;

&quot;It was nothing!&quot; Cream commented, &quot;but I&#39;m worried, Commander...&quot;

Eldiah crossed his arms. &quot;About what? You did excellent work.&quot;

&quot;No, not about me,&quot; Cream gestured to the sleeping boy, &quot;I&#39;m talking 
about him. How come he hasn&#39;t woken up yet? Is he okay?&quot;

Yoko sighed &quot;Why do you always get so worked up about every little 
detail? The boy is fine. He has been in stasis for some time, according 
to the information that General Schwartz supplied us with. It will take 
a bit before his body can adjust to life normally. It&#39;s probably a 
stretch for him to breathe outside of water as it is.&quot;

Cream tugged at her bangs. &quot;Okay... if you say so, Yoko.&quot;

&quot;By the way,&quot; Commander Eldiah looked around, &quot;where is Lieutenant 
Gestalt?&quot;

The redheaded girl answered that. &quot;Well I&#39;m not sure about that one. 
He&#39;s been acting kind of weird since we came back from Protea though. 
When he saw the face of this guy, he seemed to know him Ash even called 
him &#39;Rain&#39;. But after that... Ash wouldn&#39;t go near him. Strange, huh?&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Yoko snorted, &quot;That boy is just self-centred. 
He never thinks of anyone but himself and quite frankly I&#39;m sick of his 
attitude&quot;

Commander Eldiah and Cream stared oddly at Yoko for a moment. Then Yoko 
looked back and those incredulous stares with one of her own. &quot;...What?&quot;

&quot;Oh, never mind,&quot; Cream hopped up onto her feet, &quot;I&#39;ll go get him. See 
what&#39;s up.&quot;

The leader of the Darshana Division agreed to that. &quot;Okay, Lieutenant. 
Be aware that this was not the end of our full task. We still have to 
deliver this boy to the Ministry. Once the Paracelsus stops off at 
Ladeny for some supplies and refuelling, we&#39;ll be heading to Crux Cartha 
to hand him over. The Ministry&#39;s own envoy will take them the rest of 
the way.&quot;

Cream nodded back and skipped off down the length of the infirmary, past 
the other injured members of the crew. The metal doors to the far wall 
opened for her when she approached them and she gaited out of them, into 
the main corridor of the second floor. Though she wasn&#39;t certain where 
Ash was on the ship, Cream had a pretty good idea where he was right 
now. That boy had a habit of going to similar places when he was in a 
bad or irritable mood. Cream jogged down the carpeted hall down to a 
certain compartment in the side of the hallway. It stuck out slightly 
but was fixed into the Paracelsus&#39; hull. It was a viewing balcony 
Completely covered over with highly protective transparent plastics and 
framed with metal. From that balcony you could get a good view of the 
landscape whilst travelling across the surface of a planet. In space 
(the travel for which this ship was truly intended) it gave a brilliant 
view of the stars. 

Cream looked through the glass of the inner door and saw Ash standing by 
the wall just ahead of the balcony of the partition. He looked like he 
was deep in thought. You didn&#39;t often see that kind of expression on 
that boy&#39;s face. Cream opened the first of the two doors leading into 
the balcony and then the second. She entered into the mini-room with Ash 
and pulled a bright smile across her face.

&quot;Ash? You okay?&quot;

The blonde one pressed his hand into the small wall of the balcony while 
the other was fixed on his hip. He tilted his head back up. &quot;Cream. What 
are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I got worried about you,&quot; She admitted, &quot;Since we came back from the 
mission, you&#39;ve been kinda...&quot;

Ash smiled grimly. &quot;Yeah. I understand.&quot;

&quot;So then? What&#39;s the deal?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just... thinking, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;Thinking?&quot; Cream pondered it, hooking her hands behind her back 
innocently, &quot;About what?&quot;

Ash sighed &quot;The past, mostly.&quot;

&quot;This is about that kid, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

The blonde one looked back over his shoulder with a small smile. &quot;Kid? 
He&#39;s the same age as you, Cream. Sixteen. And he&#39;s only a year younger 
than me, though he doesn&#39;t look it His name is Rain Sorel.&quot;

&quot;So you DO know him,&quot; The younger soldier said victoriously, &quot;I knew it! 
So what&#39;s the story?&quot;

Ash dropped his smile and looked back out through the full-wall windows 
to the rolling snow-covered hills of the northern Rehoboam countryside. 
&quot;That&#39;s what I was thinking about. You&#39;re right, you know He and I did 
know each other... I do know him...&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;I could tell you that we were just friends...&quot; Ash began, &quot;but if I 
were truthful... I guess the best way to say is that we&#39;re... or we 
were... lovers.&quot;

Cream&#39;s bright face blushed hard and her cheerful smile became a sly 
grin. &quot;So Rain was your boyfriend!?&quot;

&quot;Geez! Well... if you wanna put it like that, then yes... he was my 
boyfriend. It was a long time ago.  Back during the old days when my 
parents were still alive...&quot; Ash&#39;s face darkened, &quot;...and when my 
brother was still around...&quot;

The smile on Cream&#39;s face faded away when she realized the sudden change 
in her friend&#39;s disposition. One thing she knew about Ash was that he 
didn&#39;t talk about his past. It was the same as Yoko, but it was also 
very different in many ways. People were too intimidated by Yoko and her 
stormy personality to really question and pry into her past of her 
private life. With Ash, most of the crewmembers just got the feeling 
that he didn&#39;t like discussing it. So they never brought it up. And none 
of them were off the mark. 

Now even Cream became serious. &quot;Ash? I&#39;m worried about you...&quot;

&quot;You worry too much,&quot; He tried to give her another smile, &quot;I&#39;m not so 
feeble yet, Cream. I can... face up to the memories. No matter how 
painful I think they are or... how much I wanna bury them. I&#39;m not sure 
that someone as innocent as you could... really understand what that 
feels like.&quot;

Cream pressed her hands against her chest. That wasn&#39;t true, actually 
She did understand. More than Ash was aware of at the time. Practically 
everyone had memories they wanted to bury. But some more so than others. 
Cream was no exception to the rule. &quot;What is it... you feel you&#39;re... 
running from...?&quot;

&quot;...Everything, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

Ash exhaled a breath. &quot;Look, I don&#39;t talk about it often. &#39;Cause it&#39;s no 
one&#39;s business but my own. But... I really trust you, Cream. Maybe more 
than anyone else right now. The fact is... my parents were scientists. 
You might have heard of them. Wilhelm and Maria Gestalt. They were two 
of the top Saviour Researchers of all time. And they worked with Rain&#39;s 
father, Dr. Heinrich Sorel. I don&#39;t know what they were working on 
before that day... but...&quot;

&quot;But what?&quot; Cream asked softly.

&quot;I can&#39;t explain it,&quot; Ash gripped the wall tighter, &quot;not really. But 
three years ago... when Rain and I lived with my parents in their 
research facility... Saviours attacked the base. I don&#39;t remember much 
about that day. I can still picture fire, ashes, smoke, and that nasty 
stink of molten metal. And I remember...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Ash&#39;s expression became angered. &quot;I remembered how that bastard killed 
my parents...&quot;

&quot;W-who?&quot; Cream said with a gasp.

&quot;It was my Brother,&quot; The blonde one turned around again, &quot;I recall 
seeing that son of a bitch hack them down like pigs in a slaughterhouse. 
He disappeared ten years before then... when I was about five; but I 
knew it was him. I knew it because... there was a time when I missed 
him. And when you see someone you think you care about do something like 
that... it kind of dispels the image. It&#39;s easier to remember someone 
you hate, I think&quot;

The younger soldier shook her head solemnly. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Ash.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize. You didn&#39;t do anything wrong. Making the apologies for 
someone else&#39;s mistakes won&#39;t change a damned thing anyway. And I&#39;ve 
come to terms with losing my Mom and Dad. What bothered me was... Rain.&quot;

&quot;He was with you, wasn&#39;t he?&quot; Said Cream.

Ash breathed in hard. &quot;Since the day I met him... I made a promise to 
myself... that I would protect him. That I would always look after him 
and that no matter what shit came his way, I&#39;d be there to block it off. 
And look at how that turned out. I failed him.&quot;

&quot;But, Ash-&quot;

&quot;No, Cream,&quot; He said sternly, &quot;I screwed up. I thought that he had been 
killed that day... but... now he&#39;s alive. Which means... not only did I 
fail to protect Rain like I thought I could... but I&#39;ve been letting the 
Ministry experiment on him all this time... God, what must his Father 
think of me?&quot;

Cream shook her head. &quot;But that&#39;s not true! You were just fourteen, 
right? What could you have done to protect him from the Saviours back 
then?!&quot;

Ash silenced himself for a moment after hearing that -- for a certain 
reason. He felt a warmth in his hands, like he had done three years ago, 
when he had last used...

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter what the reason is,&quot; Ash said suddenly, &quot;the fact of 
the matter is... I broke my promise because I was too weak to do 
anything for him That&#39;s why I joined the army -- so that I could make 
myself stronger. So that if I ever found someone else to protect... I&#39;d 
be able to do it without failing. But now he&#39;s alive... how can I go in 
there and face him? When I thought Rain was dead I could put the fact 
that I broke my oath behind me. But he&#39;s alive and... when I look into 
his eyes I... I&#39;ll be reminded that... my weakness nearly got him 
killed. How worthless does that make me?&quot;

Cream shook her head repeatedly. &quot;That&#39;s not right! You&#39;re not 
worthless! You&#39;re one of my best friends, Ash! You&#39;ve never let me down! 
I know what happened with Rain is hurting you... but that doesn&#39;t mean 
that you should avoid him because of it! I&#39;m sure the only person he 
wants to see right now is you!&quot;

&quot;...You think?&quot; Ash asked genuinely.

&quot;Uh huh!&quot; She replied, &quot;I&#39;m sure of it!&quot;

The boy sighed. &quot;You really want me to see Rain, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yup!&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re not gonna let this go until I do, are you?&quot;

&quot;Nope!&quot;

Ash lowered his head with a smile of defeat. &quot;I don&#39;t think I could get 
away with not seeing him now that you know about all of this, right?&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; Cream said with a nod. 

&quot;Man,&quot; The blonde youth chuckled, &quot;this is so typical of you, Cream. 
Come on then. Let&#39;s go see Rain.&quot;

The redheaded soldier giggled happily and hooked her arm around Ash&#39;s 
left She dragged him off from the glass-room of the balcony and back 
into the main corridor of the second floor of the Paracelsus. The two of 
them walked from there straight to the infirmary. When the automatic 
doors for the two of them opened, they walked inside, seen by both 
Commander Eldiah and Yoko. Cream unhooked her arm while Ash took a deep 
breath and started walking. When Ash came up to the bed he looked down 
and saw the boy. The one no more than a year younger than himself. The 
one whom he had failed to protect.

&quot;...Rain...&quot;

The Commander stared at his subordinate for a moment. &quot;Lieutenant 
Gestalt? You know this one?&quot;

&quot;...Yes, sir.&quot; He answered. 

Yoko uncrossed her arms. &quot;Who is he then?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s Rain Sorel,&quot; Ash told her, &quot;we were... kinda close once.&quot;

Cream held her hands at her hips with a smile stepped ahead. Before 
anyone knew it, she was behind Yoko and the Commander. Which was when 
she started pushing. Yoko and Eldiah scoffed without understanding, but 
Cream only ordered &#39;these two need to be alone!&#39; before shoving herself 
and her companions out the metal door to the right. Though there were 
still a few other people laid up in bed in the infirmary, they were all 
asleep as Rain was, so there was nothing to worry when it came to being 
overheard. Ash kneeled down to his knees and rested his hands on the 
edge of the bed. Ash stared silently at Rain for a moment. It had been 
at least three years since he had last seen the boy, but he was just as 
beautiful now as he was then. 

That might have seemed like a odd word to use for a boy.

Beautiful

But that was what Rain was. Beautiful. Ash thought that honestly. All of 
Rain&#39;s features were so delicate and petite, but in an effeminate sense. 
Even the smallest things about Rain&#39;s body were proof of that in Ash&#39;s 
mind. The short auburn brown hair and the long, bounding bangs that came 
from them, the soft milky tone of his skin, the pixie dust-like 
chocolate freckles over his pouting cheeks and button nose, the now 
concealed brightness of his emerald green eyes, the black silky length 
of his eyelashes, his pink and slightly dampened lips; everything about 
Rain; Ash had loved. And he had matured into his beauty so well since 
then. To see him in the flesh now just made Ash more aware of how badly 
he failed back then.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Rain.&quot; Was all he said. 

Ash tilted his head down forlornly and reflected on his thoughts, which 
made him unaware that Rain&#39;s eyelids were trembling. Suddenly those 
emerald eyes began to open for themselves. Rain&#39;s eyelids fluttered open 
and revealed his bright emerald eyes to the world. He squinted, as if he 
were unused to using them, and slowly turned to see Ash locked in 
thought. Rain&#39;s lips parted with surprise, and though his voice was 
frail, it didn&#39;t stop him from addressing the blonde soldier.

&quot;...A-Ash...?&quot;

The sound of that melodic albeit weakened voice caused Rain to gasp. He 
was awake. &quot;...Rain.&quot;

**********

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re okay for moving around so much? You sure you don&#39;t 
need to rest s&#39;more?&quot;

Rain smiled innocently at that while Ash sighed. Now he understood where 
Cream got her reputation for being such a worrier. An hour had passed 
since Rain had arisen from the slumber he had been induced into having 
from being locked inside an oxygenated test tube for so long. And he was 
beginning to settle into himself again. Minutes after Cream had gone out 
of her way to make sure that Ash had some alone time with Rain, she 
couldn&#39;t help herself from coming into the infirmary and seeing what 
happened after she left. To her surprise, Rain was awake. And she had 
never seen Ash looking so happy before. The blonde boy&#39;s eyes were lit 
up with a new charge of life and Cream was so pleased to see it. The 
three of them spent the following while talking between themselves. 
Mostly just Cream teasing Ash about his concern, even though Cream was 
the one most concerned about Rain&#39;s condition beforehand. That didn&#39;t 
stop until one of the Darshana Division operatives came in and said that 
a room had been prepared for Rain in the dorms. Cream and Ash decided to 
show him to it And they were on their way now. The three of them walked 
down the long corridor of the dormitories of the Paracelsus, where all 
the personnel slept during their allocated hours. 

As Rain walked along between Cream and Ash down that corridor, he shook 
his head for a no. &quot;Please... do not be concerned with me I am fine. 
Although I must say, I... was rather shocked to wake up here and... to 
see Ash... after all these years...&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s good too, right?&quot; Cream nudged eagerly, &quot;Now you two can pick 
up where you left off!&quot;

Ash blushed hard. &quot;Cream! You&#39;re embarrassing me, goddamnit!&quot;

Cream stuck her tongue out while Ash glared back with flushed cheeks. 
Rain giggled lightly at the pair of them. Ash had made good friends 
since the old days. &quot;It&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t mind.&quot; 

The three of them kept walking, until Ash stopped before a particular 
door. A door that happened to be his own, judging by the little plaque 
on the side which read &#39;Lieutenant Ashriel Gestalt&#39;. When Ash stopped 
before it Cream and Rain did the same, turning back to him 
questioningly. Cream was the one who spoke up about it, though. &quot;Why&#39;d 
you stop, Ash?&quot;

Ash gave Cream a genuine look. &quot;You mind if I talk to Rain alone for a 
little while?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; She replied with a shrug, &quot;I should catch up with Yoko now 
anyways. I&#39;ll see you two later then, okay? Maybe we can do something 
when we stop to refuel at Ladeny?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Lets do that.&quot; He told her.

Cream smiled and waved when she started walking down the opposite 
direction. Ash shoved a hand into the pocket of his normal green and 
gold military uniform and took out his key card. He swiped it through 
the control panel of his bedroom door and walked inside. He prompted 
Rain to follow him, which Rain did. When Rain looked around he could see 
that it really had been three years since their last meeting. Everything 
around here told him of the changes that Ash had made to his life since 
then. The posters of his room in the old Gestalt Research Facility were 
all of his favourite rocks bands and computer game characters. Now they 
were replaced by landscape painting of old Earth. Hanging off the wall 
above his bed was a scroll written in a ancient Earth language that Rain 
couldn&#39;t quite understand. To their right was a bookshelf which, rather 
than being overloaded with comics, contained actual books. Most of them 
seemed to be about swordplay but there were some that focused on modern 
philosophy and psychology, as well as geology and humanism. Ash was 
still only seventeen years old but he had grown up a lot since three 
years ago. As pleased as Rain was for that, it actually hurt him to know 
that Ash had been making all these changes too his life when Rain wasn&#39;t 
there to see it. As selfish as that might have sounded, he did feel that 
way. A little.

&quot;Well, this is my room,&quot; Ash noticed the sudden drop in Rain&#39;s mood. &quot;Is 
something wrong?&quot;

Rain looked up from his sandals. &quot;You&#39;ve been... growing up without me. 
I... wish I could have been there.&quot;

&quot;Same to you,&quot; Ash told him with a smirk, &quot;I wish I was there too.&quot;

This might not have seemed like a smart thing to do, getting 
reacquainted, especially since Rain would have to be turned over to the 
Ministry soon, but they couldn&#39;t help it. Ash nodded his head to his bed 
and walked over to his chest of drawers. &quot;You can sit down, you know.&quot;

Rain did that, lowering himself to the bedspread. Ash opened the door to 
the mini-cooler he had on top of his chest of drawers and extracted two 
bottles of mineral water He walked over to the bed and sat down, being 
careful to put a bit of space between them. He handed Rain the bottle. 
&quot;Here.&quot;

&quot;You remembered...&quot; The brunette said smiling, taking the bottle.

&quot;Well you always told me back then that I should drink more of this 
stuff These days I&#39;d rather have a beer, but... it keeps the body 
healthy. And I can&#39;t drink on duty either, which makes sense. Who&#39;d 
wanna fight the Saviours with a hangover.&quot;

Rain giggled to himself. 

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just,&quot; Ash couldn&#39;t help but notice the beautiful twinkle in 
Rain&#39;s eyes when he said, &quot;I&#39;m glad to know you haven&#39;t changed too much 
since the old days.&quot;

Ash pulled a smile. &quot;I guess not.&quot;

Rain certainly wasn&#39;t different. He was still so petite and innocent, 
but not like Cream. Rain&#39;s attitude was gentle and self-aware, with a 
kind of confidence that shined enough to put even the worst memories 
aside for as long as possible. It was kind of hard to describe if you 
couldn&#39;t experience it for yourself, Ash noted that, but he could see it 
so well in Rain. Even now he brought no attention to the fact that he 
had been used like a guinea pig by the Ministry. And he had not been 
liberated from that fate. He was only to be transported to a safer 
location before being handed over to the Ministry&#39;s department in Crux 
Cartha. 

&quot;So what have you been doing with yourself since then?&quot; Rain asked, &quot;If 
I have to ask?&quot;

Ash leaned back on the bed. &quot;I joined the military. Straight after... 
what happened. At first I was just a part of the normal sector, but 
after I helped deal with a Saviour attack on a little southern city, I 
was promoted to Lieutenant. Then a year ago I was drafted into the 
Darshana Division; a special operations corps against the Saviour 
insurgency.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot; Rain looked away, &quot;...and what about...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Rain&#39;s large green eyes saddened slightly. &quot;Your romantic life.&quot;

To be honest, Ash hadn&#39;t expected that one. He probably should have, 
considering what they once were to each other. But he would have thought 
that Rain would have had more pressing concerns on his mind. Like what 
was going to happen to him now. Ash was so thrown by what Rain had asked 
him that he clammed up a bit When moments passed and Rain realized that 
Ash wasn&#39;t answering him, he turned to his left and stared questioningly 
at him. &quot;Can&#39;t you tell me?&quot;

&quot;...Well, I... just...&quot;

Rain looked away again. &quot;...I&#39;m being selfish I shouldn&#39;t expect that 
after three years you would still-&quot;

&quot;There hasn&#39;t been anyone since you.&quot;

That last comment hung in the air hard. Ash crossed his arms behind his 
head uncomfortably and leaned backwards over the bed. The bottle of 
water in his hand dropped with him. While Rain sat properly but with a 
million thoughts running through his mind It was flattering to him in a 
way. But if anyone, Rain could see that Ash took no pride in it. He was 
a good-looking, kind man and he was certainly capable of finding someone 
to be with. Even in the old days, the girls couldn&#39;t get enough of Ash. 
But if what he said was true then he hadn&#39;t been in relationship with 
anyone else since his one with Rain. Years had passed and he still 
hadn&#39;t let go of his feelings; even though he had thought that Rain was 
dead. That just went to show it - there was still something between 
them. Attraction was a given, but... there was still more than that. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rain apologized, &quot;I never wanted to hold you back.&quot;

Ash grinned &quot;You didn&#39;t hold me back, I held myself back. If I wanted to 
let go of you... I would have done.&quot;

That was another positive change in Ash since those days. He seemed to 
find it easier to express his emotions now. A quality that Rain 
certainly found magnetic. &quot;...I never stopped thinking about you. Even 
when...&quot;

&quot;Rain...?&quot;

Although this conversation was verging ever closer and closer to the 
question on the current state of their relationship, the part of Ash 
that was a soldier had some confusions to clear up. The biggest one 
being, &quot;Look I have to know. We both survived the Saviour attack. But 
how is it that you ended up as a test subject of the Ministry? How did 
you...?&quot;

&quot;...It was him,&quot; Rain said sadly, &quot;...I thought he was saving me... 
but... he was working for them.&quot;

Ash didn&#39;t even have to hear the name to know that Rain was talking 
about his older Brother. &quot;Goddamn that bastard...! What did he even want 
with you?!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Replied the Sorel boy, &quot;they kept talking about 
something called the Anti-Lambda Effect as if it was important when he 
left me with the Ministry. They said that I hold the secret to that. But 
after that day they didn&#39;t treat me like a prisoner. I was well looked 
after, I&#39;m guessing out of respect for my Father. He and your Mother and 
Father were members of the Ministry too at a point. Then a few months 
ago they put me in stasis. That&#39;s basically... what I understand of it.&quot;

Ash scowled &quot;Goddamnit. I can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve been going through all 
this. All because of that murdering bastard! How many more times will he 
screw me over?!&quot;

&quot;...Ash...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; The soldier of Germanic descent said, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t have let 
it happen. But I swear to God, Rain, if I&#39;d have known that you were 
still alive I would have-&quot;

Rain nodded &quot;I know that.&quot;

&quot;But I-&quot;

Again, Rain was forced to calm Ash down. He place a sole finger upon his 
lips, gently shushing him for the moment. Ash composed himself for a 
second; taking notice of how soft Rain&#39;s fingertip felt against his 
lips. He was a man of quick temper but Rain always knew how to calm him 
down. 

Rain waited until Ash chilled out a little before saying. &quot;Listen to me 
Don&#39;t for a second think I blame you for what happened. You swore that 
you would always protect me and I still believe that. Please don&#39;t ever 
doubt it, Ash. You&#39;re the one thing... I have to hold onto.&quot;

Ash took Rain&#39;s hand into his own. &quot;I... missed you so much.&quot;

&quot;I missed you too.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Ash proposed something, &quot;If you&#39;re feeling up to it... the 
Paracelsus is stopping in Ladeny city to refuel and restock on supplies. 
Cream and I have some free time so we&#39;re going to stop there for a 
little while and relax. You wanna come?&quot;

Rain gave him a bright smile. &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot; 

**********

The Ministerial Bastion, headquarters of the Ministry, possessed the 
largest set of laboratories in the known sphere of influence. More than 
45 levels of which were underground while another 32 existed above 
ground as part of the main building. Obviously the more important 
experiments involving issues important to the Ministry (and those that 
were not dangerous to the building on the whole) were conducted in the 
lower levels of the Bastion. And a very important one happened to be 
getting underway right at this moment. It was a very hall in which it 
would take place. One wide enough to swallow up half of the Tsar&#39;s 
Kyhshi Palace. It was divided into three levels. One was the 
observational bay -- a railing surrounding the upper walls of the room 
from which the experiment could be viewed from a non-participant&#39;s 
position. The second of them was the observational platform. The place 
where the organizers of the experiment and its overseers would what they 
needed to carry it out. The third and final part was ground level. That 
was where all the proceedings would... proceed. 

In the centre of that ground level area was a certain &#39;woman&#39;. 

One of the BAS-Series bioandroids. But this time this one could be 
easily differentiated from the others. Her body was enswathed in 
futuristic armour. Silver-painted/gold-streaked plates constructed from 
the lightest kind of protective titanium were connected to her wrists, 
shins, thighs, arms, hands, neck, and chest. From the girl&#39;s back 
extended six metal protrusions, each one shaped like the exhaust pipe 
tail of a Magi Armour. They seemed to have no purpose now; but there 
was. Aside from the armour and the white undershirt beneath it, the 
bioandroid was naked. Her limp and armoured body was strapped to a tall 
steel cross as if prepared for a crucifixion. The steel crucifix stood 
in the centre of a shallow ring-like indentation in the ground. From the 
grooves of that indentation were a set of cables and wires, as well as 
electrodes, for a now unknown purpose.  

The girl was motionless, unconscious. 

Computers and those running them were positioned twenty metres south of 
the steel crucifix Twenty young men and women, the operatives of the 
experiment, all dressed in white lab coast bearing the insignia of the 
Ministry on them; sat beside them with their fingers to their keyboards. 
Even now readings were coming in from the sleeping metal girl in their 
care. 

The observation platform was slightly above the ground level. Standing 
beside the railing of that platform was none other than Dianus Maximus 
and her redheaded &#39;doll&#39; Isabelle. The two of them stood together and 
watched as the scientists down below prepared things. But there was 
someone else waiting there. Someone who had just recently come through 
the door to the back of the platform A tall woman dressed in the same 
lab coat as her subordinates and a big player in the Ministry.

Dianus didn&#39;t even have to look back to know that she was approaching 
&quot;Dr. Kuhnen.&quot;

Doctor Annette Kuhnen, as she was called, strode up to Dianus with a 
gentle smirk. &quot;Many greetings, Doctor Maximus. I trust you are keeping 
well.&quot;

&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; Dianus said, &quot;Formalities. I don&#39;t have a great deal 
of memories to draw back upon in which I&#39;ve seen that from you.&quot;

&quot;The same might apply to you and pleasantries,&quot; Annette pressed her hand 
into the metal railing, then cast her eyes to the right and saw 
Isabelle, standing next to her mistress obediently, &quot;and who might she 
be? That is a model from the BAS-Series, right? Is she is not a member 
of personnel?&quot;

Dianus gestured to Isabelle. &quot;No she is not. She is the first of the 
BAS-Series. My secretary, Isabelle.&quot;

&quot;Secretary, eh?&quot; Annette repeated, &quot;it&#39;s funny. The planning stages 
necessary for the BAS-Series was begun more than a decade before you and 
I were born. Because of the lack of the necessary biological profiling 
and a significant deficit in funds, they could not be completed until 
now. Yet when you take over... each of the results were cast in the same 
image. One that seems to have a great deal of similarities with 
Alexandra-&quot;

Dianus cast a hateful stare at Annette. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare speak her name. 
I cast that past away years ago. Who my creations do or do not look like 
is absolutely none of your business.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry, Director. I didn&#39;t mean to strike a nerve.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a terrible liar, Annette. You were so in university and you are 
so now. And I don&#39;t need any of your disingenuous apologies. I came here 
to work. And that is exactly what I will do&quot;

Annette looked away with a smile. &quot;Very well. I must offer you my 
thanks, anyway. The other teams and I were busy working with the systems 
of the Zarathustra But since DNA samples have not been implanted into 
the main cortex as yet -- I cannot begin my part in the act. Thus I 
appreciate being given the opportunity to work on something else in the 
mean time.&quot;

&quot;It can&#39;t be helped. Your skills in the nanomachine field are necessary 
for the modifications that will be made after the activation of the 
Zophim.&quot; Dianus told her.

&quot;I am flattered,&quot; Annette looked out to the armoured girl on the steel 
crucifix, &quot;so she is the one who will be used as the sample for the 
core?&quot;

Dianus pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose. &quot;Yes. All the other 
Seraphim Replicates have been completed on Planet Shem. However the 
Zophim was far too important to allocate to the Shem branch. Once the 
data on the completed models were sent here -- we began work. The 
Esdraelon Conglomerate needed to be assuaged thanks to the delays on the 
Baruva Cannon. They should keep Bardia busy.&quot;

&quot;But the Zophim is not a part of that, right?&quot; Annette questioned. 

The older woman smirked. &quot;Of course not. She has a far greater destiny 
ahead of her. The psychological and spiritual strain that would be 
placed on a normal human being who will attempt to do what the Zophim 
will do is too great. What better tool to use than a soulless vessel? 
One who cannot feel pain or joy?&quot;

&quot;I suppose that you are the one most knowledgeable about the SIGMA 
Project You should understand better than anyone how well the Zophim 
will be able to cope in resonance with the Mahalah sample. But I am most 
impressed by the weapons specs She will be stronger than any other 
humanoid weapon we have ever made; yet her purpose is not warfare... it 
seems somewhat ironic, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Dianus pressed her hand against her side. &quot;Not necessarily. There is no 
assurance that we won&#39;t have to use her in combat. The Galactic 
Confederacy could always make trouble for us should they happen to 
discover the true nature of the Master Plan. And that doesn&#39;t even take 
into account the reaction that the Esdraelon Conglomerate will have if 
they figure out that Zophim has been kept secret from them. I refuse to 
believe that we won&#39;t ever have to defend ourselves in the future.&quot;

&quot;She certainly has the capability,&quot; Annette took a look at the papers on 
her clipboard, &quot;the memo I received says that not only was she 
programmed with psychokinetic and photokinetic capacities, but also that 
she can channel those powers through the long-ranged Crescentius-PRO8000 
lance-rifle she has been equipped with, correct? I had heard that the 
military were planning on providing soldiers with those kinds of weapons 
for use against the Saviours but I did not know you of all people were 
one of the ones behind its development.&quot;

Dianus looked at Isabelle for a moment before continuing. &quot;Weapons 
development is not my forte by any sense of standard. But I was 
commanded by the military to act. What choice did I really have in the 
matter? In any case, the Crescentius is finished and is ready to be 
linked to the Zophim&#39;s Sahaja operating system. All we need to think 
about now is the activation of the Zophim.&quot;

And so the dark-haired woman looked down on the twenty scientists. 
&quot;Begin the activation!&quot;

Shouts of &#39;yes, ma&#39;am&#39; were thrown back to her by some of the workers 
down there. They began an even more frantic tapping of the keys of their 
control panels. In front of all twenty computers but a short distance 
ahead of the Zophim, who was still strapped to the steel crucifix, was a 
flat visual producer. It generated a holographic mapping sphere which 
seemed to run in tandem with the unified actions of the desk-bound 
clerks. 

&quot;Affirmative,&quot; Said Technician #1, &quot;activation test for the ZOPHIM 
Seraphim Replicate begins.&quot;

A second Technician tapped the keys of her terminal. &quot;Contact made with 
Agnus Dei IGP, Prometheus. Permission granted for power diversion 
through the Bastion.&quot;

&quot;All probes working in link with the Sahaja Operating System,&quot; Said 
Technician #4, &quot;re-routing energy supply through Ministerial Bastion to 
TEC Umbilical Cable. &quot;

A reaction suddenly took place in the Zophim as the technicians did 
their work. Connected to the ceiling was the long &#39;umbilical cable&#39; that 
had been plugged into the lower-back of her skull on the other end. It 
started glowing as energy was passed through it from the generators of 
the Bastion to the Zophim herself. Its body jerked a bit but did not 
awaken immediately. And yet that did not seem to be an expectation right 
away. Then a second cable descended from the high ceiling along a metal 
shaft. The shaft came down close enough to the head of the Zophim to 
attach that new black cable to the left side of her head

&quot;Cephalic Neuromodulator Umbilical Cable inserted. Now secreting 
neuromodulator fluid into Z-A1 brainstem at 89.2%.&quot;

&quot;Energy transfer is beginning,&quot; Started Technician #8, &quot;ego borders 
vitalized. Cerebral cortex vitalized. Cerebellospinal tract vitalized. 
Total central nervous system revitalization!&quot;

Technician #12 looked up from his computer. &quot;Lowering neuromodulator 
fluid by 35.87%. Ideographic projection indicating unmitigated 
acceptance of revitalization&quot;

&quot;Acknowledged,&quot; Said Technician #17, &quot;Sahaja Operating System running at 
full power. 67.9875% of all bodily functions of the Zophim are operating 
in semi-operational stasis. Now proceeding with removal of 
Neuromodulator Umbilical Cable and preparing for cardiovascular 
stimulation.&quot;

The black cable attached to the Zophim&#39;s skull was ejected with a puff 
of cold air and sallow white liquid. It dangled freely from the upper 
levels while electrical energy was still being pumped into the Zophim&#39;s 
body by the lengthy blue cable sticking out of its cranium. This time 
that power was focused on a specific spot of the Zophim&#39;s 
biotechnological body. Its lithe, buxom body jerked hard at that, its 
limbs shrugging hard at the chains that bound it to the steel crucifix. 

Technician #3 grinned. &quot;Cardiovascular stimulation is a success. We&#39;ve 
got a heartbeat!&quot;

&quot;Roger,&quot; Claimed Technician #18, &quot;preparing to fuse Valkyrie-PRO8000 
Armour into the peripheral and central nervous systems of subject 
Zophim.&quot;

There was a momentary delay. Then the undersides of the plates of armour 
around the flesh of the Zophim began to react to the commands issued out 
by the technicians. The metal of that Valkyrie-PRO8000 armour started 
fusing with the very skin on the Seraphim Replicate. The cables from 
those plates weaved their way into her limbs and body and attached 
themselves to the bone, muscle and veins of the girl. For any normal 
humanoid it would have been a most excruciating process. But the body of 
the Zophim did not move an inch during it. It just hung from the steel 
crucifix on the edge that existed between life and death.

Technician #11 laughed victoriously. &quot;Valkyrie-PRO8000 armour 
installation is a success!&quot;

Dianus stared out at unmoving Zophim with a cunning smile. &quot;Perfect... 
that&#39;s just perfect. Now awaken it.&quot;

&quot;Very well, Ma&#39;am,&quot; Technician #7 answered, &quot;activating Lambda Effect 
Containment Geon for imminent Zophim awakening.&quot;

The technicians took that on board and got to it, working over their 
boards with rapid keystrokes The cables attached to the Zophim were 
ejected with puffs of cold air in one go The serrations around the 
circular indent that the steel crucifix had been staked into began to 
illuminate. All of a sudden a huge sphere of protective (or entrapping) 
energy surrounded the steel crucifix. It was a precaution. Then the 
holographic mapping sphere changed from a bright green to a bright red. 
And abruptly enough the Zophim&#39;s beautiful emerald eyes opened. All 
those in the hall gasped as it tilted its head upwards, swinging its 
locks of red hair around the shoulder plates that had been infused into 
her very skin. She yanked her steel covered arms from the binds and 
kicked the chains off her feet, jumping down to the ground. When she 
landed on the ground, the six metal protrusions stemming from her back 
started humming a low growl. Six beautiful and sparkling sapphire blue 
wing-like energy manifestations shot out from then. The six-winged 
Seraphim Replicate stood up while the others gasped. The Zophim was 
alive and awake.

Dianus called out to it from the platform. &quot;Tell me! What is your 
name!?&quot;

The Zophim&#39;s voice was extremely slow and methodical, like that of 
Isabelle &quot;Joint Esdraelon/Ministerial Production -- Hyper Seraphim 
Replicate ZOPHIM.&quot;

&quot;And what is your purpose?!&quot;

The sparkling eyes of the Zophim looked up at her creator. &quot;The catalyst 
of that which shall be God.&quot;
