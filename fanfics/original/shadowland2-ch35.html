<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch34.html">Back to Part 34</a><pre>&quot;Carey?!?&quot; Kris exclaimed, &quot;What is she doing here?&quot; 

&quot;Who&#39;s Carey?&quot; Natalie inquired wishing not to be left out of the 
conversation. 

&quot;My insane little sister.&quot; Kris explained while running a hand through 
her hair in frustration, &quot;She was in charge of murdered souls until she 
snapped and started manipulating people to kill each other for her. She 
thought death was a game and she was always trying to gather more souls 
then the rest of her sister combined. She was finally forced to leave 
the Halls for tampering with lives. That was centuries before I was 
banished.&quot; 

&quot;Geez.&quot; Tanya shuddered at the thought, &quot;Why would she be here? And 
where&#39;s Jenn?&quot; 

&quot;She probably has Jenn.&quot; Kai explained dismally, &quot;We have to find her 
before Carey kills her.&quot; She began to leave the washroom when Kris 
grabbed the girl by the arm and pinned her to one of the washroom 
stalls, &quot;Hey! You are hurting me!&quot; She cried out. 

&quot;Quiet!&quot; Kris snapped at her sister, &quot;You knew Carey was here all along, 
didn&#39;t you?&quot; She snarled, &quot;DIDN&#39;T YOU?!?&quot; 

&quot;I had a feeling.&quot; Kai admitted, nervous of her sister&#39;s anger, &quot;I hoped 
it wasn&#39;t her. That it was just the shadows acting up.&quot; 

Kris slammed the girl against the stall, &quot;LIAR!!&quot; She countered, &quot;You 
know that an angel and a shadow feel differently. I may have not been 
one for awhile but I remember that much.&quot;

&quot;Kris?&quot; Tanya set a hand on Kris&#39;s arm, &quot;Aren&#39;t you over reacting.&quot; 

&quot;You would not understand.&quot; Kris stated, never letting her eyes off her 
sister, &quot;First Gwen shows up with a gift of Jenn&#39;s memories, and then 
Kai here appear the very next day and is acting rather friendly around 
Jenn.&quot; She glared at her sister, &quot; I should have known something was up 
because these girls never appear unless there is some ulterior motive. 
So tell me the truth dear sister. Why are you really here?&quot;

Kai let out a sign of defeat, &quot;Gwen told me to watch over you.&quot; She 
explained bleakly, &quot;She saw Carey was moving about the woods recently 
and she figured Carey must have been heading for you. Probably in an 
attempt to get on father&#39;s good side or something.&quot; 

&quot;So you decided to watch over us, is that it?&quot; Kris inquired 
sceptically. 

&quot;I knew you wanted nothing to do with me so I figured I would get close 
to your friends to see what they knew.&quot; Kai continued, &quot;I didn&#39;t want 
Carey interrupting you new life. I thought she would come after you. I 
never thought she would attack your friends.&quot;

Kris let Kai go, &quot;She wants back in the family.&quot; Kris remarked 
miserably, &quot;She has been trying to find a way for years. She probably 
planning bring Jenn&#39;s soul to father.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Natalie exclaimed in shock of this news, &quot;She plans to offer up 
Jenn as a gift to your father? Why would she do something like that?&quot;

Kris lowered her head in shame, &quot;Because I refused to do it when Father 
commanded me years ago.&quot; She stated bluntly.  

&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Tanya inquired, &quot;We can&#39;t just allow her to 
bring Jenn to Death himself.&quot; 

&quot;We won&#39;t.&quot; Natalie declared glancing down at Kai, &quot;Can you take us to 
the Death&#39;s Corridor?&quot; 

&quot;Are you insane?&quot; Cherilyn interjected, &quot;No one ever returned from 
there.&quot; 

&quot;I can.&quot; Kris stated and knelt before her sister, &quot;I need to ask a 
favour. Can you take me to Jenn?&quot; She inquired anxiously. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Kai said confidently, &quot;But I am sure your dream walking friends 
will get there first.&quot; 

&quot;Dream Walking friends?&quot; Tanya inquired even more confused then before. 

&quot;Those red-haired girls.&quot; Kai explained simply, &quot;I felt them enter the 
dream world soon after I got the feeling from this building. If we are 
luck they will get to Jenn first.&quot; 

&quot;And if we are unlucky Carey may take them along for the ride.&quot; Kris 
remarked dismally. 

&quot;I hope they know what they are doing.&quot; Tanya commented. 

Kris placed her hand upon a mirror and it sunk into its surface, &quot;I&#39;ll 
bring them back.&quot; She stated confidently as she crawled across the 
counter and into the mirror. 

Kai gave the girls a quick smile, &quot;We&#39;ll bring them back. Don&#39;t worry.&quot; 
She quickly followed her sister through the same mirror. &quot;Take care.&quot; 
She waved before pulling her hand through the mirror.

&quot;I will never get used to this.&quot; Cherilyn stated as she watched the 
mirror ripple for a moment then return to normal.

&quot;I only wish I could help them.&quot; Natalie remarked miserably. 

&quot;You could help us move.&quot; Tanya hinted with a shy smile.

Natalie stretched, &quot;Show me to the boxes.&quot;
