<h1>The Misadventures of Holly-Raine (part 4 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hollyraine-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Saturday morning. 

For most of the working populous, it was a happy day. No work. 
Nevertheless, for a teacher, it was a total godsend. Teaching had to be 
one of the most stressful jobs in the world. In addition, with the 
little recognition it receives, it was no wonder that Debbie felt so 
withdrawn. However, she could not mistake her current sadness for 
stress. In truth, it had more to do with Linda then anyone else. Debbie 
sighed as she pulled up from the covers of her bed, made with mauve 
Egyptian cotton. She rubbed the matter from her eyes, yawned, and then 
looked over at clock at her bedside table. 

It was about 9.30. 

Thank god. Debbie was hopping that she did not wake up too early. She 
had to sleep off the wine from last night. Had she drunk anymore, she 
probably would have made a fool of herself by doing something crazy. 
Like go and talk to Linda. She could not. She could not do that one 
thing. For the past week, all her friends had been telling her to go and 
talk to the blonde, maybe resolve the situation with words, not matches 
of yell and shout. But Debbie couldn&#146;t do it. Not like this. The History 
teacher stood up from her bed, tapping both feet to the ground, and 
yawning once more. It was a bright day out, the sun was shining. Maybe 
she would go out and mark her papers in the park. It was always nicer to 
mark reports and tests in the sun. Just when she pleased herself with 
that thought, Debbie took a glance at her answering machine. She was one 
of those rare people who kept a phone in her room. Moreover, there was 
one message blinking its existence. You didn&#146;t have to be a genius to 
know whom it was from. 

Debbie simply ignored it. Hearing more of Linda&#146;s incessant claptrap was 
not on the agenda today. Therefore, Debs did the opposite, and went 
straight for her computer. Checking her e-mails would not be such a bad 
idea. She switched it on, hooked up her modem cable into the nearest 
phone jack, and then left her bedroom. She needed a cup of coffee before 
she did anything else. Coffee was like a woman&#146;s best friend. Kept you 
awake, and by god, it never let you down. Debs plodded through her 
upstairs hallway, went downstairs, and into the kitchen. She put on the 
kettle, and then whipped out the coffee beans and cream.  A couple 
minutes later she had the desired coffee, then went back upstairs. After 
taking a seat by her computer and logging on, she was just about to 
check her inbox to see if anybody had contacted her for whichever 
reason. Before she could, an IM box appeared on screen.

forest baby: mornin&#146; babes! u sleep well?  

Debbie smiled sweetly. Her best friend online, forest-baby. A woman who 
lived in San Antonio. Debbie loved speaking to her. She was so 
understanding and sweet, and had been really supportive after Debs told 
her about Linda. Before she knew what she was even doing, Debbie was 
tapping keys under her own alias, Archaic-girl. 

Archaic-girl: I slept as well as can be expected, so thanks for asking! 
^_^

forest baby: well u know I always worry &#145;bout u.  especially after what 
u told me.

Archaic-girl: I think Linda gave me a call when I was asleep last night.

forest baby:  what did u do?

Archaic-girl: I ignored the message. I just don&#146;t feel like speaking to 
her. Everyone else tells me that I should, but I just can&#146;t.

forest baby: she really hurt u, didn&#146;t she?

Archaic-girl: Yes, she did. But I suppose I can&#146;t blame her for not 
being committed to me.

forest baby: why do u say that?

Archaic-girl:  Well, I&#146;m not in my prime anymore. I&#146;m 34. She&#146;s still 
seems so young and innocent. How can I expect her to commit to me? Linda 
is everything I want, but I just don&#146;t think she&#146;s ready for anything 
more. 

For a while, Forest Baby made no response. Debbie was just about to 
question that, until another message was offered from her. But this 
time, it was a little bit more obscure than the others. 

 forest baby: i&#146;m ready 4 more

Archaic-girl: Excuse me?

forest baby: u read what I wrote debs. i care &#145;bout u. i want 2 take 
care of u.  

Well, this was out of the blue. Debbie had not once heard Forest Baby 
talk like this. More often than not, she was on a humour-trip. Now that 
she thought about it... was that just flirtation? But that made no 
sense. Debbie had been seeing Linda for months now. And her friendship 
with Forest Baby had never been effected. What on earth could this all 
mean? 

Archaic-girl: How long have you felt like this?

forest baby: since u stood up 4 me against that homophobe on our forum. 
u made me feel special. 

Debbie remembered that. That was almost four months ago. All this 
time...

Archaic-girl: I had no idea...

forest baby: so what does this mean 4 us? u willing to give me a shot? 

Archaic-girl: What do you mean?

forest baby: i want us 2 meet.

Holly-Raine scowled irritably as she waited by the oak tree. Jenny had 
called her last night and told her that they would meet up in the park 
closest to Summer&#146;s house before they headed over their. The party did 
not start until 9.00 tonight, and it was 9.40 in the morning right now, 
but Holly and Jenny had promised to come over and help Summer with all 
the things that needed doing. Her parents were out of town, so they 
could get wild, but Summer&#146;s house was huge, and really hard to take 
care of. Even harder to prepare for events.  But that wasn&#146;t the only 
reason Holly was anxious. It was Saturday, the very *day* of Summer&#146;s 
birth, and she *still* hadn&#146;t gotten her anything. Holly ran though her 
brain repeatedly, for something that Summer would really like. Not a 
piece of jewellery or clothing that she&#145;d eventually abandon. Holly 
wanted to give Summer something that came from the heart. Something that 
she would appreciate. It might have seemed weird, or odd, that Holly 
would care so much about a stupid present. But Summer meant the world to 
her. She, Summer and Jenny had been friends since they were kids. 

But just as yet, she hadn&#146;t gotten what she wanted for Summer. Nothing 
seemed right. And Holly was running out of time. 

&quot;Hey! Holly!&quot;

The girl in questioned looked around to her left. Just up the 
cobblestone path, etched into the grass of the park, was Jenny. A smile 
on her face and a spring in her step. She came up to Holly-Raine, a 
plastic bag in hand, and smiled. 

&quot;Morning.&quot; Jenny said sweetly. &quot;You ready to go?&quot;

Holly frowned. &quot;You&#146;re kinda late, y&#146;know?&quot;

&quot;I am? Only by ten minutes or so. That&#146;s not a big deal, is it?&quot;  Jenny 
just shrugged. Then of course, she noticed that Holly&#146;s hands were 
empty. &quot;Where&#146;s your gift for Summer?&quot;

&quot;I... I haven&#146;t gotten it yet...&quot;

Jenny was confused. &quot;You&#146;re kidding, right? Your Dad&#146;s a stockbroker, 
Holly. It can&#146;t be that hard to rustle up some cash, can it?&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s not that,&quot; Holly said quietly. &quot;I wanted to get her something 
special. Something she&#146;ll remember forever, y&#146;know? Something that can 
only come from me.&quot;

Again, Jenny simply shrugged. &quot;Why? Come on, Holly. You&#146;re making way 
too big a deal out of this. Summer&#146;s our best friend. It doesn&#146;t matter 
what we get her. You know she won&#146;t mind. Besides, she forget all about 
our presents when the party starts! You know what Summer is like. She&#146;ll 
go wild, especially since her folks are out of town.&quot;

Holly-Raine crossed her arms. &quot;You still haven&#146;t convinced me.&quot;

&quot;Geez...&quot; Jenny scratched the back of her head with her free hand. &quot;I&#146;ve 
never seen such a long face on you, Holly. Does getting something 
special for Summer really mean this much to you?&quot;

&quot;It does,&quot; Holly-Raine nodded solemnly. &quot;What should I do?&quot;

&quot;Whatever you&#146;re gonna do, do it fast. I&#146;m heading over to Summer&#146;s 
house right now, and she&#146;ll be expecting you with me. I&#146;ll make up some 
excuse though.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Jenny. You&#146;re the best.&quot;

**********

Linda struggled roughly with each book report. Each of them were well 
done, particularly those of Cassie, Jenny and Jackie. But she couldn&#146;t 
focus on any of it. All she could think about was her moody girlfriend, 
Debbie Harding. Even now, sitting at the comfort of her work desk, all 
she could think about was her Debs. When she was supposed to be marking. 
Linda had always found it easier to enjoy her weekend when all 
schoolwork had been taken care of first. And though she wanted to get 
the book reports over and done with, she found it so hard to focus. 

After all, who wants to read through and mark a twenty-page essay about 
Sense and Sensibility when you&#146;re having girlfriend troubles? Linda 
slapped the pencil to the ground when she couldn&#146;t take it anymore. She 
leaned back, eased, and tried to think if Debbie would be awake by now. 
She wasn&#146;t the type who got up early when she didn&#146;t have a good enough 
reason. But if Debbie had awakened, she would have known about the 
message that Linda had left for her. She must have read it by now. She 
must have. Right?

Linda began tapping her fingernails on her desk. Every once in a while, 
she would look over to the phone on the other side of the living room. 
Waiting for that call. Anybody who has waited for a phone call from 
someone should know what that feeling is like. Every second that went 
by, without a ring-ring, was a second spent that served to further annoy 
Linda. Soon as five minutes went passed, she felt like she was going to 
rip her hair out. Maybe something was wrong. Maybe Debbie just erased 
the message accidentally and hadn&#146;t known that Linda was calling her. 
That had to be it. If that was the case, 

&quot;I gotta call her.&quot; Linda said to herself. 

Though she might not have thought better of it, Linda&#146;s mind would have 
come up with any kind of excuse to call Debbie at that point. But call 
her was what she did. The blonde English teacher darted over to her 
coffee table, picked up the receiver, then tapped Debbie&#146;s number into 
the keypad. Seconds later, it was ringing. At least she didn&#146;t 
disconnect her phone line or anything like that...

The phone continued to ring in Linda&#146;s ear, until someone answered. 
&quot;Hello?&quot;

Linda was swooning already. &quot;...Debbie...&quot;

&quot;...Linda. What do you want?&quot;

And she was equally thrown by Debbie&#146;s response. But Linda didn&#146;t let 
that hurt her. Rather, she tried to make this situation better. &quot;I know 
you&#146;re angry with me. But please try to hear me out.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Can&#146;t we just meet?&quot; Linda asked. &quot;Can&#146;t we just talk about this? I 
don&#146;t want us to fight over something as silly as this. I hate that 
we&#146;re not talking.&quot;

It took a while for Debbie to respond. &quot;...When and where?&quot;

&quot;How about tonight?&quot; Linda suggested, cheerfully. &quot;Or even tomorrow?&quot;

Debbie heaved a sigh over the phone. &quot;I... can&#146;t. I&#146;m meeting someone.&quot;

&quot;Meeting someone?&quot; Linda then grew cautious. &quot;Someone like who?&quot;

&quot;A friend.&quot;

A &#145;friend&#146;? Linda had heard that statement over and over again. And when 
two people were fighting, an outside stimulus like a &#145;friend&#146; was never 
a good thing. The English teacher&#146;s voice became louder, not to shouting 
level, just a little bit lower in pitch.

&quot;What kind of friend is this, Debbie?&quot; Linda sharply questioned her.

&quot;Oh, you do have a very presumptuous mind.&quot; Debbie retorted angrily. 
&quot;But you see, I can&#146;t imagine why. After all, we aren&#146;t &#145;committed&#146; to 
each other. Remember?&quot; 

Now Linda really regretted voicing her opinions. And she now realized 
how serious this situation was. Debbie Harding was not a sardonic 
person. Yet here she was, asking Linda rhetorical questions. She was 
seriously angry. &quot;You said you loved me.&quot;

A silence. An awkward one. It was broken when Debbie spoke again. &quot;...I 
don&#146;t make a habit of pursuing relationships that aren&#146;t going anywhere. 
Maybe... we just aren&#146;t right for each other. It&#146;s obvious that we&#146;re in 
different stages of our lives. I think we need more than space.&quot;

There was a tear at Linda&#146;s eye, though she didn&#146;t notice it. &quot;What are 
you trying to say?&quot;

&quot;...Goodbye, Linda.&quot;

**********

&quot;With the lights out, it&#39;s less dangerous! Here we are now, entertain 
us! I feel stupid and contagious! Here we are now, entertain us!&quot;

Summer sang along eagerly, like a woman in a trance. She loved grunge 
music. Sure, she was nothing but a little kid when it was &#145;really&#146; 
popular, but it still thrilled her all the same. And it thrilled her 
even more to know that Jenny had brought the Nevermind-Nirvana CD for 
her. It was released quite a few years ago, but somehow, Jenny managed 
to track it down. And from the smile on Summer&#146;s face, that was the most 
thrilling present she had received so far. Summer removed the earphones 
from her head, switched off her CD player and put it onto the couch. 
Soon Jenny was wrapped within Summer&#146;s happy embrace, smiling sweetly.

&quot;Thanks so much, Jenny!&quot; Summer giggled. &quot;I didn&#146;t think you knew that I 
liked Nirvana.&quot;

Jenny lightly blushed. &quot;...Well, I do listen to you when you talk to 
me...&quot;

The others around the two girls giggled respectively,  swinging their 
heads to the beat. Strangely enough, none of them had even heard what 
Summer and Jenny were talking about. The music was so loud that people 
had to shout just to be heard. Which suited them just fine. This was 
Summer&#146;s birthday party. But there were no clowns, party hats or 
birthday cake. Those were replaced by the sweet sounds and sights of a 
*real* teen party. The booming speakers of the sound system released 
waves of hardcore, erratic music, music that touched the hearts and 
minds of the younger generation. Though Summer liked 90&#146;s rock, none of 
that was playing. Her mansion-like house was delightfully infested with 
the compositions of modernity, thrilling the teen partygoers inside it. 
All through the hallways, the living rooms, and the kitchen, the young 
were strewn out in great numbers.  With glasses of drink in hand, 
cheerful banter in their mouths and reckless happiness in their hearts. 

Many had come to Summer&#146;s party. Though she didn&#146;t invite all of them, 
word had gotten out fast that her parents were away. That meant total 
freedom. And all her friends acted accordingly. People had come from as 
far as Houston to take part in this scene. Boys and girls as young as 16 
and as old as 21 were here.  Enjoying the banging music, loving the 
drink and meeting new people. Eager young men flirted with the 
deceptively coy women.  People danced, and laughed, smiled and took 
part, in a night that they took no qualms in enjoying. 

Summer herself was ecstatic. Everything was going great. And since her 
folks were out of town, they wouldn&#146;t have to worry about anything. She 
had taken the time to open a few of her gifts while all the others were 
dancing and laughing, and so far she was pleased with them all. It 
really was a great night for her. Which was good, because Summer 
deserved the best. Her personality reflected her name. &#145;Summer&#146;. She was 
charming, direct, and needlessly giving. A perfect friend. It all 
tallied up to a brilliant girl who could captivate even the heartless. 
It was one of the reasons Jenny (and Holly) went out of her way find 
something Summer would really like. Only the best for the best. 

Summer smiled as she pulled back from her hold on Jenny, then looked 
over at the large double glazed window at the other side of this 
teen-packed living room. More cars were pulling up, and more people were 
heading up to her house, but there was one person she didn&#146;t see. 
Holly-Raine.

Summer turned back to look at Jenny, though she had to speak loudly to 
be heard. &quot;Holly still isn&#146;t here yet! Where the hell is she? She&#146;s 
missing the party!&quot;

Jenny squirmed. It was almost midnight. The party started at nine, and 
probably wouldn&#146;t end until morning. Yet, still, Holly hadn&#146;t arrived. 
And there were fewer and fewer excuses that Jenny could come up with to 
cover for her. What present takes so long for Holly to buy?

Jenny just shrugged. &quot;I don&#146;t where she is.  But she&#146;ll show, Summer.&quot;

&quot;She better,&quot; Summer chided. &quot;I don&#146;t want her to miss this. Holly loves 
parties.&quot;

But Summer and Jenny were the only two who heard that brief 
conversation. All others were having too much fun to worry about who 
hadn&#146;t shown up yet. And soon, both girls got back into the spirit as 
they danced to the beat, surrounded by the glorious sounds of a wild 
house party. Outside, the music could be heard. It was like a vibrant 
sound passing along the breeze. And it intimidated the young girl 
walking up to Summer&#146;s house. That girl was Cassie. 

The young woman blinked. Cars were parked carelessly against the 
driveway, some touching as far as the lawn. Summer&#146;s house in itself, 
was huge, a reflection of her family&#146;s success in life. Like Holly 
(whose father was a stockbroker) Summer&#146;s parents had successful 
careers.  And living in the suburbs of Victoria proved it. Still, her 
family&#146;s money did not show off in Summer&#146;s personality (again, like 
Holly). Summer was still bright and eager, showy and brash, like any 
other normal girl her age. It was probably part of the reason that she 
invited Cassie to her party in the first place.

But now that she was here, the blonde felt a chill of fear and anxiety 
run through her spine. Dressed in the only appropriate clothing she had 
(a knee high jeans skirt, rosy pink blouse  and a pair of sandy-brown 
club heel sandals), she still felt nervous. For more than one reason. 
For one thing, Holly was likely to be in there. Cassie had resolved to 
make a move, finally, but she was utterly scared. What if Holly rejected 
her? Calling her a freak or something? In front of all these people, 
Cassie would never be able to live that down. And even more than that, 
Shannon was invited to Summer&#146;s party. Shannon would just love to shoot 
Cassie down with another scathing remark about how &#145;dumpy&#146; she  looked. 
Or what &#145;a geek like Cassie&#146; was doing there. 

Could she really face all that?

Cassie doubted she had an answer for herself. But then, she didn&#146;t need 
to. The whole reason she was here... that notion came in the form of 
Holly-Raine. Cassie blinked, her stomach tightening, her senses 
pounding. It was Holly-Raine. The brunette was striding up the street, 
from across the road, obviously heading for that party. She looked so 
gorgeous. She was clad in a pure black, tight mini-skirt (totally 
sinful, but totally hot...) that hung snugly around the delectable rise 
of her thighs and waist. Her midriff was exposed, due to the equally 
small black tank top that Holly was wearing, tight enough to highlight 
those delicious breasts. The breasts that Cassie had caressed endlessly 
in her dreams. 

Like Cassie, Holly was wearing open-toed high heels. But Holly-Raine 
made them look glorious. Her small feet delicately stepped forward, one 
after the other, in gracefully luscious strides. Her toenails and 
fingernails were polished a dark lavender, and there was a silver choker 
necklace possessively clinging to her neck. Cassie could only describe 
how Holly-Raine looked with one phrase. 

A vision of perfection. 

But Cassie&#146;s awe took a backseat, when she realized something. Holly was 
sort of over dressed. She didn&#146;t know much about parties or fashion, but 
Cassie knew one thing. You don&#146;t wear high heels to a party. At least 
not a party that you dance at. It was only common sense. But, it really 
didn&#146;t matter. Cassie tried to keep the butterflies in her stomach under 
control as Holly-Raine crossed the road towards Summer&#146;s party-filled 
house. It was much quieter outside, so the low tones of music helped to 
set a scene for Cassie. And as Holly strode in her direction, Cassie 
prepared herself to speak.

&quot;..H-Hello, Holly...&quot;

Swish. Holly went straight past her. All the Texan brunette offered in 
response was a quick &#145;hey&#146;. The next minute, she was walking up the path 
to Summer&#146;s door, knocking on it. Cassie blinked, then turned her head. 
She watched her head as someone opened the door for Holly. She thanked 
them, then went inside, not sparing one glance at our little Cassie. 

The blonde girl&#146;s head sagged. It seemed like no matter how hard she 
tried, Holly-Raine just wouldn&#146;t notice her. Like Cassie was utterly 
invisible. And for some, that might have confirmed the answer to 
Cassie&#146;s affections. That they were pointless. Pointless if the object 
of them didn&#146;t even know you existed. But to Cassie, it was a pothole, 
not a roadblock. There was a look on Holly&#146;s face. A look of 
determination. Like she was preparing herself for something. Cassie knew 
that whatever Holly was thinking about, it had distracted her. That was 
all. 

Cassie wasn&#146;t gonna give in now. Not when she loved Holly-Raine this 
much. 

**********

Holly-Raine looked around as she entered Summer&#146;s house. Her light jade 
eyes darted from one side to the other, in search of Summer. This was 
just the lower hallway, but she was looking all the same. There were so 
many people here. More than Holly-Raine would have expected. But for 
now, they were not in her interest. 

Their was only one person she was really thinking of, and that was 
Summer. Holly walked forward, squeezing through some of the guys in her 
way. They gave her the quick eye over, and threw a few compliments her 
way. Naturally, Holly didn&#146;t respond to them. Unless they were hiding a 
pair of breasts under those clothes, Holly-Raine wasn&#146;t interested. She 
ambled through the crowds of girls and boys till she reached the open 
door leading into one of the two living rooms. Waiting in there, was 
Jenny, Summer and an assortment of teens from all across Victoria. 
Holly-Raine strode up to her two friends.

&quot;Happy birthday, Summer,&quot; Holly leaned into Summer, wrapped her with a 
hug, and placed a friendship kiss on her cheek.  Summer pulled back and 
frowned, though she was happy to see her friend.

&quot;Where the heck have you been, huh?&quot; Summer asked, still having to speak 
loudly due to the banging music. &quot;Jenny and me were getting a bit 
worried.&quot;

Jenny shook her head with a smile. &quot;Actually, I think you were the one 
who was worried, Summer.&quot;

&quot;...It really doesn&#146;t matter.&quot; Holly said seriously. &quot;Summer, I need you 
to come with me for a minute. Okay?&quot; 

Summer gave Holly-Raine a curious look. &quot;Why? What&#146;s the matter?&quot;

Holly said nothing. She simply clasped the confused Summer by the hand 
and lead her towards the exit out of the living room. Jenny watched them 
go with equal confusion, but accurately guessed that it had something to 
do with Holly&#146;s present for Summer. With that in mind, Jenny just 
shrugged and began chatting with some of the other girls. Holly paced 
with Summer through the crowded hallways of the house, towards the 
kitchen. She had slept over at Summer&#146;s house a billion times, she knew 
her way around. The moment she got to kitchen, she stepped inside and 
looked at the fifteen or so people hanging with drinks in their hands. 

&quot;Alright you guys.&quot; Holly uttered directly. &quot;Clear out.&quot;

All of them groaned, realizing that Holly was kicking them out. Summer 
laughed as the collective group ambled out into the hallway with groans, 
all rejoining the rest of the crowds on the outside. Once Holly and 
Summer were the only two left in the room, the brunette turned to the 
door and locked it, firmly. Summer was confused, even more so when Holly 
shut all the blinds that were hung over the windows. Now the kitchen was 
almost quiet, the light sound of drowned out music was the only other 
thing there. Holly walked back over to Summer, with a warm but serious 
expression on her face. Summer was perplexed by it. What was Holly going 
to so much effort for? 

&quot;Everything okay, Holly?&quot; Summer asked, concerned. 

Holly lowered her head, then clasped one of Summer&#146;s hands into her own. 
&quot;I&#146;m fine. And I&#146;m sorry I&#145;m so late. All day I&#146;ve been wracking my 
brain about what to get you, Summer. I just couldn&#146;t think of anything 
that you&#146;d really, really like. To show you how much you mean to me.&quot;

Summer gave Holly-Raine a disapproving glare. &quot;What are you talking 
about? You know you don&#146;t have to get me anything. We&#146;re best friends, 
and I-&quot;

Holly-Raine cut that statement off, placing a soft fingertip to Summer&#146;s 
similarly soft lips. &quot;I know I don&#146;t have to. But I wanted to. You and 
Jenny... you guys mean everything to me. And I just wanted to show you 
that. I know I can be a little selfish at times... but that doesn&#146;t mean 
I don&#146;t love you guys to bits.&quot;

&quot;I understand that,&quot; Summer said with a smile. &quot;But what&#146;s this all 
about?&quot;

&quot;I got you a present. To show how much I care about you.&quot;

&quot;A present, huh?&quot; Summer didn&#146;t see anything in her hands. &quot;Which is?&quot;

Holly cast Summer a confident gaze, eye-to-eye. &quot;...Me.&quot;

Now, that confused Summer the most. What did Holly mean by that? Well it 
wasn&#146;t something that Holly was going to let her ponder on for long. 
There was a slight height difference between Holly and Summer, but it 
didn&#146;t stop Holly from kissing the minimally taller girl. Summer eyes 
went wide with surprise as Holly-Raine&#146;s lips connected with hers, 
softly at first. She was astonished. Holly tilted her head to the side 
and wound her hand around Summer&#146;s head, into her mop of long, 
manageable hair. A moan escaped her lips. In truth, Holly had never 
really thought about being this way with Summer. They were friends, and 
nothing more. But that was exactly what this was about. Friendship. Who 
better for Summer to be with for the first time, than Holly-Raine? Holly 
wouldn&#146;t hurt Summer with unanswered calls or false declarations of 
love. This was just what it was. One night. To show Summer just how 
important a friend she was. 

Summer remained still, unable to take this in. Before she even knew what 
she was doing, Summer&#146;s hands worked for their own accord, slowly and 
frigidly clutching Holly&#146;s sweet cheeks, sprinkled with a innocent 
blush. The two remained that way for minutes. Exploring each other for 
the first time, for an instant, becoming accustomed to each other 
sexually, rather than just as friends. Holly-Raine pulled back with a 
sigh, her hands still woven into Summer&#146;s long locks. 

&quot;...Are you okay with this?&quot; Holly asked timorously.

Summer nodded &#145;yes&#146; without thinking of the fact. But then, she didn&#146;t 
need to. She had never kissed a girl before, but if it had to be with 
anyone, she would have wanted it to be Holly. It was strange. Before 
this night, Summer might never have classed herself as a 
&#145;girl-into-girls&#146;. Summer had had boyfriends before. She had even 
invited one of her ex-boyfriends (A/N a guy called Jackson, not really 
important) to the party. Of course, it was no surprise about Holly&#146;s 
sexuality. It was common knowledge. Holly-Raine had plenty of male 
friends, but she didn&#146;t find men the least bit attractive. But for 
Summer, this was uncharted (yet surprisingly compelling) territory. 

And yet, for the first time, she was seeing Holly-Raine as a woman. Not 
just her absent-minded friend, but as an honest to goodness woman. And 
for yet another first, Summer realized just how beautiful Holly really 
was. Maybe it was the way her emerald eyes sparkled romantically under 
the benevolent light cast by the moon, through the gaps of the shutters. 
Or the way her shoulder-long locks of milk chocolate brown hair swung to 
one side of  shoulders when she nodded. Maybe it was the kinky get-up. 
Summer couldn&#146;t place where the feeling came from. But she did know one 
thing. Something about Holly-Raine seemed different tonight. She looked 
almost magical. 

And it thrilled the birthday girl. Summer didn&#146;t know what was rousing 
her so much; the idea of being with a girl, or being with Holly-Raine, 
but it wasn&#146;t important. Not now. 

&quot;Just for this one night,&quot; Holly-Raine began. &quot;I wanna make you feel 
special.&quot;

Summer nodded again, and Holly instantly acted. If this was okay with 
Summer, then there was absolutely no problem. But first, if Holly was 
going to do what she wanted to Summer, she would have to get her own 
needs out of the way. She cast her sultry lime green eyes at Summer&#146;s, 
then took one of the taller girl&#146;s hands up to her lips. Holly&#146;s eyes 
remained fixed on a curious and spellbound Summer. Just before she 
inserted the tips of Summer&#146;s index and middle fingers into her mouth. 

Holly-Raine&#146;s startled friend looked on, warmth spreading over her body 
as she felt Holly&#146;s wet lips enveloping her trembling fingertips. 
Summer, rightfully, was nervous. But all that nervousness evaporated 
from that feeling. That feeling of Holly&#146;s sweet lips encircling her 
fingers, her wet tongue passing over them in deliberate dragging 
motions. Holly didn&#146;t close her eyes, she watched Summer&#146;s reaction, 
taking note of every look on face. In time, the teen brunette pulled 
Summer&#146;s fingers from her mouth. Holly stepped closer to Summer, then 
pulled that hand down, down so far that it hovered between their thighs. 
Holly used her free hand to hike up her black skirt a bit. She pulled 
Summer&#146;s hand under it, slowly and calmly, and continued to watch for 
her friend&#146;s reaction. Summer&#146;s hand froze when she found that she was 
touching Holly&#146;s dampening lower lips. 

Summer blinked with alarm. &quot;Y-You&#146;re not wearing any...&quot;

&quot;Do I need them?&quot; 

Well, for what they were doing, panties were pretty needless. And at 
that moment, it was really unimportant information. Summer continued on 
with Holly-Raine&#146;s direction, gently placing her saliva-coated 
fingertips against the womanhood of another person. The first thing 
Summer noticed was Holly&#146;s wetness. She was leaking. And Summer could 
feel that the condition in her underwear were very much the same. Summer 
began a slow stroke, rubbing from the edge of the hooded clitoris 
downwards, till her hand curled around Holly-Raine&#146;s vulva completely. 
Summer felt the brunette shake. Holly&#146;s eyes snapped shut, and she drew 
in breath quickly, her body tingling with Summer&#146;s curious touch. Before 
long, Summer was probing Holly&#146;s nether-region from will alone. Holly&#146;s 
hand no longer had a need to guide it. But Holly did guide Summer all 
the same. She pulled both her hands down to Summer&#146;s searching one 
(which was now wet with Holly&#146;s saliva and her premature discharge). 
Holly positioned Summer&#146;s so that her middle and index fingers were 
placed together, against her moist labial region. And her body jerked 
reactively as she forced that two-finger combo inside herself.

Holly-Raine cried out in short, muffled gasps, Summer&#146;s fingers quickly 
parting the inner flesh of her pussy. Summer was shocked at how great it 
felt. That feeling of hot, cum-ridden tissue clamping down around her 
fingers. It was indescribable. Just ten or so minutes ago, Summer would 
never have dreamed that she would have her fingers inside Holly. And now 
it was happening. In all its glory, it was happening. Holly-Raine 
squirmed internally and externally, wiggling her hips on Summer&#146;s long 
fingers. She was acting urgently, positioning Summer&#146;s thumb in such a 
way that it rubbed her clit. Further serving to thrill Holly-Raine. 

Summer watched Holly-Raine intently, entranced by her petite gasps and 
furious breathing. She watched as the nubile Holly bucked against her 
hand, and sighed from feeling her inner flesh clamp and un-clamp 
fervently with each movement. It seemed like Holly was in a rush to get 
this over with. And Summer&#146;s suspicions were confirmed. Holly cried 
loudly (luckily, her cries were drowned out by the music playing in the 
background) and slowed her breathing, decreasing the speed of her 
bucking hips. Summer felt Holly&#146;s cum firsthand. Literally. Holly&#146;s 
pussy continued to clench around her fingers, spreading her delectable 
cum around them, some leaking down to her knuckles in clinging drips. It 
was obvious that Holly had hastened that instant, but... 

It was, without a doubt, one of the most intense moments in Summer&#146;s 
life. 

Holly-Raine broke her eyes open, and they rolled over to give Summer a 
look of appreciation for her efforts. She slowly withdrew Summer&#146;s 
fingers from her sodden crack, and sighed.

&quot;I-I&#146;m glad I got that off my... chest...&quot; Holly-Raine mumbled 
incoherently.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

Holly stood upright, slowly, then touched both her hands to Summer&#146;s 
cheeks in a caring manner. &quot;...Tonight is about you, you know? Not me. 
Just lay back, okay? Just relax and enjoy this.&quot;

Summer was still a little confused. But she simply went with the flow, 
as Holly-Raine led her over to the counter in the middle of the room. 
She took each article off it, each bowl of chips and dip, every bottle 
of alcohol and even that bucket of ice. Holly moved it over to the 
surrounding counters, then looked back at Summer. &quot;Could you take off 
your clothes for me?&quot;

&quot;W-What if someone comes in?&quot;

Holly-Raine shook her head. &quot;The door&#39;s locked, Summer.&quot;

Had anyone else asked her that, Summer would have blown her top. But 
from Holly, on this night, her requests just sounded to utterly 
persuasive and melodic. Summer bashfully removed her clothes, which 
wasn&#146;t much. She didn&#146;t bother to overdress, because Summer knew that 
her clothes would be a minor issue during the party. Her hands curled 
around the bottom of her white and black tee shirt, and she yanked it up 
over head, tossing it to the floor. She next went for her jeans, and 
pulled them down in one motion. Soon Summer&#146;s jeans touched the floor in 
the same way as her shirt did, leaving behind only her underwear, her 
bra and panties. 

Summer now felt sort of awkward standing like this, in her underwear. 
Especially since ninety half-drunk youths were having the time of their 
lives outside the kitchen door. Thankfully, Holly had the foresight to 
lock it. Summer then set about removing her underwear, beginning with 
her bra. It was a white J.C. Penney brand, a &#145;bonding&#146; gift from her 
mother. She didn&#146;t like it, because it felt tight around her breasts, 
but she loved her mom too much to offend her by refusing it. It came 
down as soon as Summer unhooked it. She then slipped her panties off, a 
pair of lilywhites with a rose pattern on them. Something of her own 
choice. Summer worked her fingers under the elastic, then worked it 
downwards, to her ankles. She stepped out of the panties, which now held 
a wet patch, and then dropped it on the pile of her clothes on the 
floor. Now, Summer was completely and utter naked. 

She wrapped her arms around her sizable breasts, and watched Holly probe 
her cupboards. Holly searched through them all, one after the other, 
searching for something. And she found all of what she wanted. Four 
items in total. Summer observed them, as Holly carried them to the large 
counter in the middle of the room. A can of squirting whipped cream, 
chocolate syrup, strawberry syrup, and a plastic bottle of honey. 
Suddenly Summer had a sneaking suspicion about what Holly was up to. And 
she felt her opening get wetter with that notion. Holly placed each item 
on the counter, then slapped her hand on it, looking at Summer. &quot;Hop 
on.&quot;

The naked Summer sat upright on the edge of the cleared counter table. 
Then shifted to the middle, flat on her back. She looked up at 
Holly-Raine, who had reassumed that mischievous look in her eye.  She 
had been planning this all along. The beating heart in Summer&#146;s chest, 
and the throbbing ache at her crotch, showed that she was just as 
excited. Holly-Raine smiled as she took in Summer&#146;s lithe, buxom form. 
She was highly developed for a high school teen. From the size of her 
chest, you would have thought Summer was a practically full grown woman. 
Holly-Raine really wasn&#146;t into big breasts, but on Summer they looked 
heavenly. They were perfectly shaped with the curves of her body. 
Summer&#146;s delightful light brown aureoles encircled a pebble hard nipple, 
topping off the charm of her breasts. In addition to her long legs and 
wide eyes, Summer looked wonderful. 

&quot;You&#146;re really beautiful, Summer,&quot; Holly said confidently. Her hand went 
to the can of whipped cream. She took it smiled down at Summer, who was 
lying flat on her back. &quot;Could you open your mouth for me?&quot;

Summer did as she was asked, parting her lips. Holly took the nozzle of 
the can and out from it squirted melting soft whipped cream. Summer 
didn&#146;t eat it. How could she? The first thing she knew, the nozzle was 
gone, and it was replaced by Holly&#146;s tongue. Summer moaned, in 
appreciation of the taste, both of the whipped cream and of Holly&#146;s oral 
cavity. Holly-Raine dragged her tongue around Summer&#146;s mouth while she 
kissed her. The brunette savoured taste of whipped cream mingling 
between their warm mouths. Holly relinquished their kiss, pulled back, 
then squirted the whipped cream along Summer&#146;s neck. The birthday girl 
giggled. When Summer, Holly and Jenny were kids, they all used to joke 
about what was for dessert, straight after her birthday barbeques. Now 
she *was* dessert! 

Holly smiled at Summer, then lunged at her neck eagerly, thrashing her 
tongue around sensitive flesh covered in whipped cream. She moved over 
and over in slow motions, kissing and licking, sucking whipped cream 
between her lips while at the same time, sending waves of arousal and 
pleasure through her giddy quarry. Summer smiled and gasped, loving that 
feel of Holly licking the cream out of the nape of her neck. It was 
amazing. Even when the cream was all but gone, Holly-Raine still flicked 
her tongue over Summer&#146;s neck, over and over. Holly&#146;s hand absently went 
over for the can of chocolate syrup. Slick and dark. Just the way it was 
meant to be. Holly pulled her head upward, slurping her tongue back into 
her mouth. She then grinned, opening the cap of the plastic bottle. 
Summer shut her eyes and leaned her head back to the counter. And she 
broke out in giggles when she felt the first of the chocolate syrup drip 
onto her ample breasts. Holly moved the bottle over, and the chocolate 
was smeared over Summer&#146;s chest correspondingly. 

Soon Summer&#146;s chest was covered in thin but elongated trails of 
chocolate, the dark brown colour contrasting her pearly ashen skin. 
Holly hovered over her and dropped her head over Summer&#146;s mounds. The 
girl moaned softly, no giggles, as Holly&#146;s tongue worked its magic. It 
moved in circles, lapping up the liquid chocolate, stimulating Summer&#146;s 
firm skin in the process. Summer juddered, feeling that pink tongue 
bathing her breasts and feasting on the chocolate syrup. Magnificent. 
Even more so when Holly&#146;s lips curled around her stiff nipple.

Summer moaned and worked her fingers into Holly-Raine&#146;s head of hair. 
Holly&#146;s mouth nursed on the nub of Summer&#146;s firm mammary, while Summer 
rolled her head and ran hands through her Holly&#146;s hair. The brown-haired 
girl worked her tongue over the nipple as it nestled comfortably between 
her lips, suckling with the zeal of a newborn. Summer sighed, then 
removed her hand from Holly&#146;s hair. Her right breast, once covered with 
a thick build up of chocolate, was now covered with a thin build up of 
Holly&#146;s oral juices. The nubile Texan just cast Summer a smile and 
exchanged right for left, absorbing the left chocolate-covered nipple 
into her mouth. 

Summer continued to moan and judder. What people said was right. They 
were some things that only a woman could give. That softness, that less 
threatening scent. Holly was a clear representation of that. Suddenly, 
Summer became thankful that her first sexual experience was with 
Holly-Raine. 

Holly lifted her head, her lips smeared with chocolate. She said 
nothing, simply reaching for the next bottle. The strawberry syrup. 
Holly-Raine leaned back, then rose the plastic bottle to a slightly 
tilted, more-or-less horizontal position. She squeezed the bottle 
slowly, and a thick trail of red poured down on Summer&#146;s body. It was 
less thick than the chocolate variation, so made more of a mess. It ran 
down the sides of Summer&#146;s body, spilling onto the grey counter in 
drips. The trail passed down her midriff to her waist, then further 
south. Summer&#146;s heart proceeded to race as the strawberry-flavour liquid 
dripped over the swelling folds of her nether-lips. Again, Summer shut 
her eyes. It was strangely erotic to have that syrup gushing over her 
sacred place. Once the downpour ended, there was a brief pause. The next 
thing she felt was a jet of whipped cream being spread over the 
strawberry syrup and the labial creases beneath them.  

Holly seemed to take special care at this area, spraying cream in short 
spurts at the places that made Summer tremble. It was beginning to occur 
to Summer that Holly was far more experienced, sexually, than she was. 
Holly that shaft of a can down, then mused over her creation. Summer 
look like a sparse sundae. Just the way Holly liked &#145;um. Her eager lips 
lowered towards that strewn out, topping-covered body, and dove back to 
the flesh. Summer&#146;s stomach tightened with the touch of Holly&#146;s tongue. 
There was absolutely nothing like it. 

That lukewarm tongue ran down Summer&#146;s burning hot skin, lapping up the 
trail of strawberry syrup leading down to her pussy. Holly&#146;s actions 
further served to please the overjoyed birthday girl. It moved down 
slowly, stopping each second so that Holly could place a little kiss 
there. This continued until Holly&#146;s face reached the Y-like shape of her 
waist and thighs. Summer&#146;s crotch was hairless, kept that way on 
purpose, and so the cream and syrup hung closely to it. Holly-Raine 
licked the chocolate remaining on her lips, then went for her prize. 

Summer gasped once more, this time harshly, as Holly-Raine&#146;s mouth 
engulfed the build up of dessert toppings over her honey pot. Her lips 
ran over the cream, mixed with syrup, licking all of it like an 
aficionado. Soon all of it was gone, in mere seconds. But that didn&#146;t 
end Holly&#146;s lust. In fact, it drove it on. With one hand she parted 
Summer&#146;s opening. And with her now flavoured tongue, she sought herself 
inside it. Summer gave a shrill cry of ecstasy, as Holly&#146;s pink digit 
drove inside her. It tenderly touched areas Summer scarcely imagined it 
could reach, probing and thrusting. Summer squirmed, arching her back, 
clutching the table, as Holly&#146;s head bobbed between her thighs. Her hips 
involuntarily bucked against Holly&#146;s face. Slowly initially, then faster 
and faster the longer Holly&#146;s tongue prodded her. Summer&#146;s violent 
jerking even surprised Holly, as she had to grip Summer&#146;s hips to keep 
her in place. Once she realized that her lower body was held in place, 
it was all Summer could do to thrash her head and cry out. Holly lapped 
at that wet fissure like cream was still inside it. Though it was really 
an &#145;acquired&#146; taste, in Holly&#146;s opinion (and in the opinion of others) 
there really was just nothing like the taste of a woman&#146;s arousal. There 
was no way for Holly-Raine to really stress that point for what it was. 
Summer&#146;s premature wetness was spread over Holly&#146;s face, while she 
struggled to keep licking her. She knew Summer was a virgin, but 
goddamn... 

Summer bit her lip to keep from screaming. Though someone hearing was 
the least of her concerns, it was a reflex. She just couldn&#146;t keep 
herself under control. Holly-Raine drove her wild. Summer squeezed her 
eyes together, and tightened the muscles over her body, realizing that 
something was about to give. Just when she was brought to the narrow 
edge of that unfathomably steep cliff we call orgasm,  Holly&#146;s tongue 
retracted from Summer&#146;s tight vaginal aperture. Summer looked up in 
breathless disbelief. Holly stopped? 

&quot;W-What are you doing...?&quot; She anxiously mumbled. 

Holly-Raine leaned forward, still parting Summer&#146;s labial tissue with 
her fingers.  &quot;I need something from you.&quot;

&quot;N-Now!?&quot; 

There was a crafty smile on Holly&#146;s face. And it looked surprisingly 
sexy with Summer&#146;s wetness dripping from the corners of her mouth. 
&quot;...So who... got you... the best present this year?&quot;

Summer cast Holly-Raine an infuriated glare. Of all times to ask such a 
ridiculously obvious question! &quot;Oh Christ, is that important?&quot;

&quot;Humour me.&quot;

Summer writhed in frustration. Sometimes, she swore, she could kill 
Holly. Here she was, on the verge of quite possibly the greatest orgasm 
of her life, and Holly stopped. Just to ask some stupidly rhetorical 
question and make her sweat with impatience. &quot;Holly, please...&quot;

Holly-Raine took great delight in making Summer squirm. &quot;Say it, and I 
will.&quot;

&quot;It was the best present ever, okay?!&quot; Summer yelled irritably. &quot;Now... 
please... please just make me...&quot;

That&#146;s the ticket! &quot;Well, since you asked so nicely.&quot;

Holly smiled at the expression on Summer&#146;s face. It clearly said &#145;stop 
now, and I swear I&#146;ll kick your butt&#146;. For that, Holly-Raine was 
grateful. It meant she was doing things right for her. The brunette 
lowered her head back between the cleft of Summer&#146;s thighs, then went 
for the fleshy pearl, the centre of a real woman&#146;s pleasure. Summer&#146;s 
body reacted appropriately. Her back arched further, her mouth spread 
open and her eyes slammed her, thrusting her hips towards Holly&#146;s angel 
mouth. Only slight stimulus of her clit was enough to send the girl 
straight over the edge of that cliff. Summer screamed passionately, her 
tight pussy lactating waves after waves of discharge. Holly&#146;s mouth 
returned to Summer&#146;s womanhood, slurping up Summer&#146;s sexual makings, 
adding to the taste of cream, chocolate and strawberry. 

Summer&#146;s body ended its light spasms, and she collapsed to the counter. 
She breathed slowly, and Holly&#146;s head idly rose from between Summer&#146;s 
hips, throwing another cum-covered smile at her. Summer controlled her 
breathing, then looked back at the shorter girl. There was a glint of 
unmatched happiness in Summer&#146;s eyes that Holly-Raine had rarely seen 
before. But it sure was a welcomed sight. 

It was a birthday that Summer was unlikely to forget.
