&quot;Finally finished.&quot; Jamie stated as her body stretched while the teddy 
bear proudly skimmed over her first manuscript with a smile across her 
face. She had spent several days writing out every detail of the events 
that had transpired on those dark days. From the last day she set living 
eyes upon Maria to the final fight with the shadowy beast. She did not 
stop until every last word was recorded on paper. If anyone would 
believe her crazy story was of no concern to her. She was just glad to 
finally finish a novel, her first for that matter.

She let out a sigh of exhaustion and lay upon her desk, her eyes 
scanning her new room. Clara did not yet trust the young girl with her 
daughter so placed the girl in a room at the far end of the castle. It 
was not as luxurious as Maria or Amanda&#39;s rooms but much bigger then the 
tiny room she had at The Raven&#39;s Keep. Clara did not treat her with the 
level of respect as the other girls, but she did finally acknowledge her 
love for Maria. Jamie did not care that she was placed so far from the 
other girls for she was still living under the same roof as her love. A 
smile crossed her furry lips at the thought and she crossed her paws 
behind her head when there was a knock at the door. 

&quot;Come in.&quot; Jamie called out and sat up to see who it could be. 

&quot;How is the writing coming?&quot; Maria asked as she entered the room with a 
tray in hand, &quot;I thought you might want some tea.&quot; 

&quot;Great!&quot; Jamie jumped off the desk and walked over to a small table and 
chairs that were set in the middle of the room. Clara had specially 
crafted for Jamie so she could sit at a table when people came around to 
visit her, only problem was that everyone else had to sit on pillows 
because they were too big for the chairs, &quot;I finally finished my novel, 
My love.&quot; She exclaimed triumphantly. 

&quot;That is wonderful.&quot; Maria set the tray on the table and poured out a 
cup of tea for her lover, &quot;Now what do you plan to do with it?&quot; She 
inquired genuinely interested to learn about Jamie&#39;s career path. 

Jamie sat heavily in a chair and let out a deep sigh, &quot;Well that is the 
problem.&quot; 

&quot;What is wrong?&quot; Maria asked seeing the long look on Jamie&#39;s face. She 
set the cup in front of Jamie then poured another and brought it over to 
Jamie&#39;s body. The corpse picked up a funnel off the desk and stuck in 
its esophagus before pouring the hot broth down its throat. Maria 
shuddered that the image however she was getting used to it. They 
discovered not long ago that Jamie&#39;s body did need to eat food, it just 
needed to be blended up first and poured down a funnel, not a very 
pleasant sight, &quot;Why so dismal? I thought writing was what you always 
wanted to do. You always said your greatest wish was to finish a full 
novel and now you have.&quot; She flipped through the freshly lined pages on 
the desk, &quot;What more could you want?&quot;  

&quot;To be published... &quot; The teddy bear picked up a cookie and dunked it 
into her coffee. 

Maria peered out the window at the green fog in the distance and the two 
suns hanging high overhead, &quot;Oh, right.&quot; They may have stopped the dark 
spirit from destroying their town, however in doing so it would seem 
that the town had been pulled between worlds and no one could ever 
leave. The only way out of the town seemed to be that mysterious door in 
the middle of town and very few were willing to venture through there. 
With the nearest publishing house was several miles away in London the 
fog made it impossible for anyone to send mail anywhere outside of the 
town. 

Jamie hit her head on the table. &quot;I finally finish my book and I can&#39;t 
even publish it.&quot; She cried. 

&quot;There there.&quot; Maria patted the teddy on the back, &quot;At least we are 
together.&quot; She pulled Jamie into her arms and leaned against the side of 
the bed, &quot;That is all that is important, right?&quot; 

Jamie curled up in Marie&#39;s arms, &quot;Right.&quot; She relaxed in the warm 
embrace of her lover. The one thing that dark day proved was that 
nothing was ever going to come between their love for each other, not 
even death. She glanced out of the window; &quot;Somehow I have a felling 
that this is only the beginning for us.&quot;

&quot;So do I....&quot;

The end... until another day...
