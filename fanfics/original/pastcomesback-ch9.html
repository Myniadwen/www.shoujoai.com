<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 9 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>      Her money problem was solved with the eradication of pests and the killing of a truly 
malevolent demon that had a habit of feeding on the elderly. Tsuru was wandering along a 
countryside path, thinking. She&#39;d yet to come across the young woman she wanted to find and 
she was fifteen now... How was she ever going to find her?!

      Tsuru felt a prickle on her skin and looked around. She had felt like someone was 
following her for the last two months, but... She let out a sigh and soon came across a 
pond. On the bank, a mother was caring for a baby as her daughter washed the clothes. It 
made Tsuru smile and miss her own surrogate family.

      A young boy waded out into the pond and started swimming. &quot;Hey! Hey, mom! The water&#39;s 
really great!&quot;

      His mother shook her head and stood up. &quot;Get back here and finish cleaning your 
clothes. It&#39;s not safe to go that far out.&quot;

      The boy just laughed, but started to swim closer. It was then that Tsuru felt 
something... like a malevolent presence coming from the pond. She saw a shadow in the pond 
and realized that something was down there.

      &quot;Get away from there!&quot; Tsuru shouted, as she started to run and drop her equipment. 
The only thing she left was the dark katana in her hand. The mother and the daughter gave 
her startled looks, but suddenly the boy let out a yell. Something was trying to tug him 
under the water.

      After getting out of her boots, Tsuru dove into the water. The water stung her normal 
eye and she was once again happy for her Demon Eye. At least it helped out in these 
situations... There was a giant snake coiled along the bottom of the pond. The pond was 
barely ten feet deep, but it was still big enough for the demon to hide. It pulled the boy 
under and Tsuru struck with her sword.

      Blood drifted in the water and the snake focused its attention on Tsuru. She dodged 
its attack and then caught its head under her arm. She decapitated it, allowing the head to 
drop to the bottom. She came up for air and disentangled the little boy before swimming 
back. On the shore, the two women and the baby seemed quite hysterical until Tsuru came back 
with the boy.

      &quot;Oh, thank you! Thank you so much!&quot; the mother said, holding the boy. He began to 
cough out the water in his lungs. The daughter just went over to Tsuru.

      &quot;Are you alright? It didn&#39;t hurt you, did it?&quot; She shook her head, too tired to speak. 
She was trying to capture her breath and went back over to the pond. Tsuru sat on the bank 
and rested her hands in the water. The family behind her watched in awe as holy power poured 
into the water and purified the pond. 

***** 

      &quot;I don&#39;t think we can thank you enough for this,&quot; the mother said, giving Tsuru 
another helping of soup. The fifteen year old had unsuccessfully tried to insist that thanks 
wasn&#39;t needed. The boy was still resting from the attack and the small village had been 
treating Tsuru like a saint.

      &quot;No, no,&quot; Tsuru said. &quot;All I really need is a place to stay and some food and you&#39;ve 
all been very kind to me.&quot;

      The daughter gave her a worried look. &quot;Are you sure? I mean, you almost died for my 
brother, so...&quot; Tsuru shook her head. The family was allowing her to stay with them for a 
night or two, out of thanks. The man of the household was in the next town over working, so 
it was just the mother and her two children.

      They finished the meal and it was time to rest up. Tsuru would be sharing a room with 
the daughter, who was about the same age as her. She was a pretty girl with auburn hair and 
a sweet smile. &quot;Sorry that this isn&#39;t that great,&quot; the girl murmured, setting down a 
mattress and some blankets. &quot;We&#39;ll have to share...&quot;

      &quot;Oh no, it&#39;s fine. I&#39;m happy to have a place to sleep,&quot; Tsuru said, removing her 
clothes until she was only in the white shorts and t-shirt that lied beneath her exorcist 
outfit. They lied down together and that was when the ebony haired girl was aware of how 
close they were.

      The girl looked at Tsuru&#39;s right eye, but said nothing. They were facing each other 
and it was silent. Tsuru could feel the girl&#39;s hand on her own. &quot;You&#39;re very pretty,&quot; the 
girl murmured out, blushing.

      &quot;Uh... so are you,&quot; Tsuru said. There was a small sound as the girl leaned forward. 
Tsuru could feel something wet on her lips and closed her eyes. It was a very awkward kiss, 
but she didn&#39;t mind. The girl pulled away, looking to see if Tsuru was okay with it. The 
exorcist got a little bolder and allowed her hands to go around the girl&#39;s waist.

      This time, the kiss was less chaste and more passionate. The girl surprised Tsuru by 
lightly squeezing her breasts. They kissed again. 

***** 

      &quot;...so you really have to go?&quot; Tsuru nodded, quite sad to leave. She knew she and the 
girl weren&#39;t soul mates, but that didn&#39;t mean there wasn&#39;t a spark. She&#39;d enjoyed the 
moments they spent together - the innocent touching through the clothes and the loss of her 
first kiss.

      The girl played with a strand of auburn hair. They were by the pond and the rest of 
the girl&#39;s family was at home. &quot;I will miss you a lot, Tsuru, but... I guess it can&#39;t be 
helped...&quot; She looked so innocent and vulnerable that Tsuru felt that she shouldn&#39;t leave.

      &quot;Don&#39;t worry, when you grow older, you can leave and find someone. I&#39;m sure that you 
will be able to do it, regardless of what your family thinks,&quot; Tsuru said, bringing a smile 
to the girl&#39;s face.

      They kissed for the last time and Tsuru left, her heart full. 

***** 

      Tsuru had been reminiscing on her first romantic experience when she arrived at the 
abandoned, destroyed town. It must have been a product of war or a scuffle. The buildings 
were nothing but wooden frames with plants growing from them. It was oddly beautiful and 
Tsuru felt like this was going to be a great day, but...

      &quot;My, you&#39;ve grown.&quot; The feeling of being watched flooded Tsuru&#39;s body and the girl 
whirled around, her hand on the hilt of Uncle&#39;s sword. Who was speaking? &quot;You&#39;re so very 
beautiful, you know that?&quot;

      Tsuru flushed since it was obviously a woman speaking, but could it be the demon she 
was looking for? She finally saw her, sitting on a demolished roof, dressed in black. It was 
the beautiful young woman with the purple eyes.

      &quot;You! You&#39;re the one who&#39;s been following me?&quot; Tsuru asked, drawing both her weapons.

      &quot;Mm-hmm. It&#39;s been... three or so years. I must say that you are a great exorcist,&quot; 
the demon replied with a smile.

      &quot;How can you... how can you say that, you murderer! You slaughtered my clan!&quot; The 
demon tilted her head and let out a sigh.

      &quot;Oh, that. They had it coming, little... hmm, what&#39;s your name pretty girl?&quot;

      &quot;Tsuru and I&#39;m going to be the one that kills you,&quot; the girl replied, ready to fight 
the demon.

      &quot;Oh, that&#39;s nice. Tsuru... Tsuru...&quot; the demon said, letting her name roll off her 
tongue. &quot;You have such a nice name. I&#39;m Isaka and yes, I am the one who killed your kin. 
They had it coming, mind you.&quot;

      Tsuru gritted her teeth and removed her eye patch. Her Demon Eye honed in on Isaka and 
she said, &quot;I&#39;m going to defeat with this thing you gave me. I hope you&#39;re ready to pay for 
your crimes.&quot;

      Isaka&#39;s face softened. &quot;I am... I am truly sorry for what I did to you. I didn&#39;t 
realize that you were a small child when you came at me - I though you were one of the 
exorcists. I am happy to see you using my gift,&quot; the demon said. &quot;But, I do not regret 
killing your kin.&quot;

      At that, Tsuru launched herself at the roof, climbing up some of the fallen wreckage. 
Isaka easily avoided the blow and leaped to the ground. Tsuru followed after, swinging down 
both swords. &quot;I see you&#39;re using you&#39;re friends&#39; weapons?&quot;

      &quot;Yes, so I won&#39;t ever forget what you did!&quot; Tsuru struck out with the blue blade, only 
to find her wrist caught.

      &quot;Well, they are both nice swords. It&#39;s quite amazing to see you wield this with one 
hand,&quot; Isaka said, smiling at Tsuru. The young girl then swung with the katana, making the 
demon jump away. &quot;But you&#39;re too slow, Tsuru. You need to train more.&quot;

      The ebony haired girl ignored her and charged. In a flash of dark energy, she was 
disarmed, her weapons flung to the ground. Tsuru fell forward at her knees, shocked. How... 
how could she be so easily beaten? This was no different from the time three years ago.

      Tsuru got up and tried to instead punch at the demon. Isaka started to laugh at her 
and simply nailed her in the gut. The wind got knocked out of her and as she sunk to her 
knees, the demon caught her and sat down on the ground.

      &quot;Silly, silly Tsuru. You can&#39;t beat me like this...&quot; Isaka said, stroking the girl&#39;s 
hair as she lied in her lap, trying to catch her breath. &quot;Train more.&quot;

      Tsuru was furious, but knew there was nothing she could do. The demon could kill her 
right now, if she so wished it. It was then that the arms tightened around her and Tsuru 
became oh so aware of the demon nuzzling into her hair.

      &quot;So pretty...&quot; Isaka said before she started laughing again. &quot;That&#39;s probably why that 
country girl was all over you.&quot;

      Tsuru flinched and tried to escape, her face burning. Isaka merely made the girl face 
her and placed their foreheads together. &quot;I&#39;ve been watching you since that day... I gave 
you that eye, so no matter what, you can&#39;t escape me.&quot;

      Tsuru gritted her teeth. &quot;I don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t mind - it will give me the chance to kill you!&quot;

      Isaka laughed at her again and Tsuru was reminded that she was a powerless child 
caught in the jaws of a demon. &quot;So be it, pretty little Tsuru... that&#39;s fine by me.&quot; The 
demon looked reflective, as if examining Tsuru. &quot;I wish I had struck a little sooner - too 
bad I can&#39;t be your first kiss, but I can be your first... real... kiss.&quot;

      The demon chuckled darkly as the girl tried to escape and leaned forward. Tsuru 
blinked away the tears as she swept up in a kiss, so unlike that of her first one, the one 
she had with the pretty girl with the auburn hair... This one was dominating, passionate and 
full of such lust. She couldn&#39;t help letting out a slight moan into the kiss and a yelp when 
that mouth move down to her neck.

      Tsuru was in a daze during her first make out session and when it was over, she found 
herself lying on the ground, staring up at the blue sky. The top buttons on her jacket were 
undone and the demon was nowhere to be found. 

***** 

      &quot;...you murdered her friends and then molested her?&quot; Isaka winced at Krystal&#39;s 
assertion.

      &quot;N-no! It wasn&#39;t... ugh, I just kissed her, I mean, all that stuff doesn&#39;t happen 
until later and...&quot; The demon let out a long sigh, suddenly very pissed at Tsuru. How was 
she ever going to make this up with Krystal?!
