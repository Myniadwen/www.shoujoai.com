Kaira mumbled to herself slowly throughout the night. Though 
most people might not have expected it, she slept like a baby 
last night. In fact, she had slept better last night than she 
did most nights. Not that she remembered much. Her dreams were 
infested with images of fire and smoke. Warm night air and 
burning embers. But rather than see this as destruction or a 
violent event, Kaira saw it all in a rather different light. It 
gave her a distinct feeling of warmth and security. She could 
tell as much when she began to awaken. The young girl&#39;s eyes 
fluttered open and her arms stretched from one side of her to 
the other. She yawned, clad only in a set of pink pyjamas that 
she wore to sleep in the nights. The girl blinked and looked 
over at the alarm clock on her nightstand. 7.45 in the morning. 
A Tuesday. She had school today. But for some reason... she 
didn&#39;t feel very nervous about it. Not nervous at all, actually. 
Which was surprising, especially since she would probably have 
to deal with Motoko and her little ultimatum. 

But thinking about that issue made Kaira strike on other ones. 

&quot;Hmm...&quot; She mused, &quot;Now that I think about it... what happened 
since yesterday? I remember going to my Grandpa&#39;s Shrine and I 
remember him telling me about becoming his successor. But 
weirdly... I can&#39;t remember anything else. I wonder what that&#39;s 
about?&quot;

Still, she was feeling good this morning. No matter how she had 
gotten home last night. The blonde-brunette ambled out of the 
bed of her room and began scrambling for some clothes. 
Thankfully Hajime Seimei High School allowed personal dress. She 
would have hated to claw into a monotonous school uniform every 
weekday morning. Eventually she decided on something that she 
didn&#39;t always wear. Mostly because it attracted too much 
attention from the opposite sex (and on occasion, the same sex). 
It was a small white tank top, printed with the kanji for the 
rabbit (Usagi). Around her legs was a very small pair of denim 
jeans shorts. They were sheared at the leg holes. The typical 
and sexy car wash look was beamed from them. On her feet her a 
pair of sand-straw sandals. She had picked them up in Okinawa 
when she went there for a holiday last year. And they still 
fitted her like a dream. Before putting all that on she skipped 
out into the bathroom and ran herself a shower. A good thirty 
minutes later she reappeared from the bathroom with a spring in 
her step and a smile on her face. Fully dressed and ready to go. 
Kaira strode to the stairs from the upper floor and made her way 
downstairs. From there she could smell her mother&#39;s cooking like 
never before. For some reason she felt like she was more aware 
of the things going on around her. 

Kaira walked over to the kitchen to see her mom, Reina, cooking 
over the hob of her stove. 

&quot;Morning, Mom!&quot; Kaira said cheerfully.

Reina looked over her shoulder. &quot;...Kaira? You sound quite 
cheery this morning. I was surprised about that. After all, your 
grandfather told me that he worked you pretty hard yesterday. 
I&#39;m glad to hear that.&quot;

Kaira walked into the dining room attached to the kitchen and 
took a seat around the table at the corner. While she sat she 
took the time to think about what her mom said. It was strange. 
She didn&#39;t actually remember doing any real work yesterday. But 
Kaira just shrugged it off and waited for her mom to come on 
over. The first thing that Reina did was to bring in a pot of 
warm tea. Not much of a western mother was our Reina, but she 
did have a fondness for the hot beverage. Reina poured some for 
Kaira into a cup and then did the same for herself. 

&quot;Kaira,&quot; The older woman started, &quot;You do seem a little happier 
than you were before. Is there something you want to tell me? 
You know we never got to finish our little chat yesterday 
morning. Does this have anything to do with that?&quot;

Again Reina pointed to Kaira&#39;s cheek. To the bruise. But to the 
mother&#39;s surprise, the bruise was almost gone. It looked as 
vivid as a melon yesterday but today it was all but gone. 

&quot;Did you put some sort of make up on it?&quot; Reina asked. 

Kaira blinked, sipping her tea. &quot;Make up on what?&quot;

&quot;The bruise I pointed out yesterday,&quot; The older woman sipped her 
tea also, &quot;You must have used something to cover it up.&quot;

Then Kaira&#39;s memory returned a bit. The bruise she had gotten 
from Motoko, the schoolgirl gang-banger. Though she felt a 
little more relaxed about the Motoko issue, she still didn&#39;t 
want to worry her mom with the truth about the origins of the 
bruise. Even if it was healing up quickly. &quot;Uh... I guess I must 
have put on some blush or something last night. Worked wonders, 
don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Reina pulled an eyebrow. Her lie radar was flickering. And Kaira 
could tell that her mother was far more perceptive than she gave 
her credit for. Which made her think that she better hurry and 
get to school before Reina could drill her anymore about the 
obvious little details that cropped up from time to time. The 
teen ran a hand through her blonde bangs and gave off a little 
nervous giggle, staring over to the door.

&quot;...Uh... sorry I can&#39;t stay longer Mom, but I have to be going 
to school now. I think that I might catch up with Yuki if I 
hurry. Seeya!&quot;

As soon as she set down that cup of tea she had taken a sip of 
and made a light stride for the door which came out as more of a 
dash. Before Reina even knew what was happening, her daughter 
was out of the door and gone. But the elder of the Yatagami 
women didn&#39;t make a move to stop her. She simply sat and took 
another sip of her tea, and mouthed a quick little statement,

&quot;I think that daughter of mine... is hiding something from me?&quot;

 ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;There&#39;s a girl with cinnamon eyes. Bake me in butter, eat me 
with cream, cinnamon eyes,  
more than a dream. La, la, la...&quot;

The innocent Kaira bounded down the street towards Hajime Seimei 
School with great pride and happiness as she sung a little 
Gentatsu Boys song to herself. She felt so uplifted this 
morning. Even if she had to dodge a few of her mom&#39;s question. 
Questions that didn&#39;t need to be addressed in Kaira&#39;s opinion. 
But none of it got her down. Though she couldn&#39;t quite place her 
finger on the reason why, Kaira was feeling great. Better than 
ever really. Now worries were hassling her, no thoughts about 
school or the Phoenix Hill Shrine. Just this. And for some 
reason... Kaira was looking forward to seeing Yuki more than 
ever today. She had been aware of her feelings for the martial 
artist for so long now... and she was starting to believe that 
Yuki might be feeling the same way about her... but Kaira had 
yet to muster the courage to actually open her heart to Yuki. 
Maybe she&#39;d feel the same way... maybe they would start 
something from that. It seemed so possible now. Far more 
feasible now than it would looked before. However, before Kaira 
had a chance to properly ponder the possibilities in her head, 
she turned a corner around the fenced parking lot that she just 
happened to be walking around.  

The second she did so, she bumped into someone. 

Kaira rebounded with a questioning glimpse, and her eyes with 
graced (or cursed) with the sight of one of Motoko&#39;s usual 
cronies. By the name of Mari (real name Mariko). Then Kaira 
looked over to the right, behind Mari. She caught sight of 
Motoko&#39;s other major stomping partner, Kuki (real name Kumiko). 
Kuki and Mari were known as the &#39;Chick Muscle&#39; of Hajime Seimei 
School. Neither of them were as skilled as the likes of Motoko 
or Yuki, but they were pretty strong for such normal-looking 
girls. But the worst of the pack was taking up the rear. It was 
the teen bully herself, Motoko. Looking just as rough and 
disagreeable as she always did. 

Mari stepped back and scowled at Kaira. &quot;Stupid girl! Can&#39;t you 
look where you&#39;re going? Bash into me like that again and you&#39;re 
dead meat!&quot;

Kaira remained still for a second. Then burst out with laughter. 
&quot;Ha, ha, ha! That&#39;s funny, Mari! You&#39;re so funny! Now just buzz 
off before someone gets hurt, okay?&quot;

That was an unexpected reply. Normally Kaira was so demure and 
submissive. Motoko said nothing but her eyes showed a lingering 
tint of concern. That wasn&#39;t like Kaira at all. Kuki was up next 
with the threats. She strode straight up to Kaira and sneered at 
her, saying,

&quot;So! Baby Kaira gets a little backbone, eh? I suppose there&#39;s a 
first time for everything in this world. But you better watch 
who you run your mouth off too. Yuki Kuragama isn&#39;t here to save 
your bacon this time, girl.&quot;

And still, Kaira just waved that off. &quot;Oh, you guys are so 
clueless! Yuki is far too good to be dirtying her fists with 
your blood! She&#39;s got more important things to do!&quot;

For Kuki and Mari, that was just one comment too far. Kuki 
arrogantly cracked her knuckles in front of the seemingly 
helpless Kaira. &quot;That does it. I don&#39;t know who you think you&#39;re 
dealing with but you&#39;re gonna regret ever talking to me like 
that!&quot;

In that single moment, Kuki dropped all the bravado and just 
thrust her right fist straight at Kaira&#39;s face. The girl stood 
silent and still for one moment. Then a brilliant flash of 
alertness passed through her. Her left hand moved like greased 
lightning and flashed straight for Kuki&#39;s attacking wrist. The 
punch was stopped seconds before it landed. Causing both Mari 
and Motoko to gasp with shock. Kuki scowled and struggled to 
pull her wrist free. But the grip of Kaira was like iron. She 
couldn&#39;t get free. And what was worse? The fact that Kaira 
didn&#39;t even seem to be trying. The girl held that same sweet, 
cheerful facial expression she always did. Kuki couldn&#39;t 
understand it. But her concerns grew more urgent after that. 
From the point at which Kaira held her, the right wrist, 
something felt hot. Very hot in fact. Kuki squirmed 
uncomfortably and with great urgency as Kaira&#39;s hand changed 
from lukewarm heat to burning in seconds. 

Kuki screamed a second later. &quot;Aaahhh!&quot;

When smoke began to rise, Kaira released Kuki&#39;s wrist and let 
her stumble backwards. The injured bully sobbed a little and 
then looked down at her wrist. Burn marks were there.  In the 
shape of Kaira&#39;s hand encircling her arm. All three of the 
bullies cast frightened and confused glances at the younger 
girl. Then Kaira&#39;s expression changed from happy to battle 
thirsty. Then in another split-second movement she rushed 
forwards and ruthlessly punched Mari across the jaw. The taller 
girl screeched with agony and fell backwards, holding her mouth 
in pain. And Kaira recoiled, locking eyes with a startled 
Motoko. 

Kaira&#39;s eyes thinned out as she spoke. Or rather, as something 
spoke for her. &quot;...Pervert. I know what you&#39;ve been doing to 
Kaira. I have all her memories. You fed off her shame and her 
fear... like a leech. Because you knew... that Kaira would never 
accept your attraction to her. Thus you forced yourself on her 
so that she would never have a choice in the matter.  I normally 
wouldn&#39;t bother to deal with scum like you. But Kaira deserves 
the kind of revenge that only I can give her.&quot;

Motoko stepped back in shock. &quot;...What are... you talking 
about...?&quot;

No more words needed to be said. Kaira (heavily under the subtle 
influence of Jann Mei) rushed forwards toward the stunned bully. 
There was one hell of a loud thud as Kaira struck the girl in 
the stomach. Vibrations from the strength of the punch flooded 
through the body of Motoko. So strong that her eyes widened with 
the pain in one brutal moment. The pair of them froze in 
motion... then Kaira stepped back, withdrawing her fist from 
Motoko&#39;s gut. The bully fell to her knees groaned. Seconds 
later... chunky white cream started pouring out of her mouth by 
the bucket full. Motoko threw up all over the street pavement, 
groaning, coughing and spluttering. The young thug then 
collapsed on the ground next to her puddle of regurgitation. 
Leaving Kaira with a satisfied smile on her face. The 
blonde-brunette grabbed Motoko by the collar and pulled her up 
to her face. 

&quot;Take this warning,&quot; Kaira yelled at her, &quot;If you ever come near 
me again, I&#39;ll make sure that you regret it. Next time I&#39;ll let 
Yuki have you. And I&#39;d love to see if you could come out of that 
alive.&quot;

Motoko was then thrown back into the pavement. Kaira stood back 
and looked down at her hands. Flames began to surround them. But 
not a single tongue of them burned her. It felt as natural to 
her as bathing in water. &quot;Kami-sama... what&#39;s happening to 
me...?&quot;

 ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Kaira... is everything alright...?&quot;

School was over.

As soon as the first period came in Hajime Seimei High, the last 
period came around just as quickly. The day had gone before for 
Kaira with the speed of a cat. But Yuki was far less concerned 
with that and more with Kaira. She had been acting strangely 
today. Not strange in a bad way; just very different from the 
way that Kaira normally acted. She was far more outgoing and 
bold right now. She was answering questions in class, humouring 
the many men who sent her love letters rather than ignoring 
them, standing up for herself, doing things in a generally 
confident way. It was, in some respects, a welcomed change from 
the way Kaira acted in the past. She was taking better care of 
herself; demanding that she be treated in the way that she 
should have been. As a young woman, not just some quiet little 
mouse in the corner. But in other respects, it was worrying. As 
much as the old Kaira needed to stick up for herself more, the 
change was too... sudden. Something was up. It might not 
necessarily have been a bad thing... but it was catching Yuki&#39;s 
attentions in more ways than one. 

The two girls, Kaira Yatagami and Yuki Kuragama, walked together 
from the outer gates of Hajime Seimei School. Down their road, 
following the same path that led them towards the Phoenix Hill 
Temple. 

Kaira looked up at Yuki as she was asked that. &quot;Is everything 
alright? Of course it is! I feel great. Better than I ever have 
in a long time, really. I feel... free somehow. Like I&#39;ve just 
dawned on something that&#39;s given me a whole new set of choices 
in life.&quot;

&quot;Choices in life?&quot; The Kuragama-girl repeated, blinking.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kaira nodded to the taller girl, &quot;Things feel great. I 
feel great. It&#39;s like that moment when you finally put a key 
into a lock and see what&#39;s inside. Everything is clear now. Ever 
since I went to my grandfather&#39;s shrine yesterday afternoon, 
I&#39;ve been feeling this way.&quot;

Yuki probed again. &quot;...Has this &#39;new feeling&#39; you have got 
anything to do with Motoko being absent from school today?&quot;

&quot;She got what she deserved.&quot; 

&quot;...Kaira...&quot; Yuki finally stopped walking, &quot;...You don&#39;t 
actually mean to tell me that you took care of Motoko yourself 
do you?&quot;

&quot;Is that so hard to believe?&quot;

Well, truth be told, Yuki&#39;s answer to that question was yes. 
Kaira wasn&#39;t really a strong girl in any sense of the term 
(aside from emotionally). And as far as Yuki knew; Kaira hadn&#39;t 
studied any real forms of martial arts before. She knew that 
Kaira&#39;s grandfather Oburo was a powerful fighter in his day. And 
was the consummate master of Yatagami-style Japanese Karate. But 
that had never reflected on Kaira to her knowledge. The 
blonde-brunette looked up at Yuki again and could see that 
sceptical look in her eye. The taller girl didn&#39;t believe that 
she had been the one to take care of Motoko and her gang. 
Well... there was something that Kaira could do to amend that. 
The shorter girl looked down the street both ways to make sure 
that no one was watching any of this. Then she dragged Motoko 
into a narrow alleyway they had just walked past. 

Yuki blinked. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Just watch, Yuki.&quot; 

Kaira stopped with the newfound solitude and then brought up one 
of her hands. She clutched it into a fist and smiled. Then 
focused her thoughts and energy. Her sweet sky blue eyes slipped 
shut and her fist began to shake a little. Yuki watched this 
intently. But a gasp escaped her lips when Kaira&#39;s fist suddenly 
burst with bright flames. They coursed around Kaira&#39;s hand and 
wrist but did not burn her. Adding a bright new glow to that 
dark alley. 

{Spirit Fire?} Yuki thought, astounded, {That&#39;s impossible! 
Martial Artists have to train for years in order to produce 
spirit fire of that strength! How could Kaira master something 
like that when she hasn&#39;t even had any training?}

&quot;Pretty cool, eh?&quot; Kaira jabbed, &quot;I discovered it this morning. 
I bumped into Motoko and her gang and they were throwing their 
weight around as usual. Something just clicked inside me and I 
acted. I defeated each one of them, Yuki. Motoko, Mari and Kuki. 
I don&#39;t know how or why... but something has &#39;awakened&#39; inside 
me. I feel almost invincible now.&quot; 

&quot;Have you told anyone else about this?&quot; Yuki asked. 

Kaira shook her head. &quot;No. I couldn&#39;t tell my Mom because it 
might frighten her. But I&#39;m going to talk with my Grandpa about 
it when I get to the Phoenix Hill Shrine. I have a hunch that he 
might understand what&#39;s going on with me. Not that I&#39;m 
begrudging it. I love the power I&#39;m feeling right now. I feel so 
warm and loose and confident.&quot;

Yuki blinked again. &quot;...Confident?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; And at that point, Kaira&#39;s expression switched from 
charmed by her own powers to charmed by Yuki. The shorter woman 
looked up with bright blue eyes of vivid emotion and caring. If 
Kaira would have wished for this level of confidence in the past 
then it would have been for this very moment. The flames around 
her fist receded swiftly. Almost out of a reflex action. And 
Kaira&#39;s warm hands found themselves against Yuki&#39;s colder 
cheeks. The taller woman froze with surprise at Kaira&#39;s sudden 
closeness and display of affection. But that freezing shock 
melted into a wave of lustful passion as Kaira, standing on her 
gentle tip-toes, pressed their lips together. Both girls moaned 
into each other and suddenly lost their sense of surroundings. 
While their kiss grew in fervour, Yuki&#39;s hands wound around her 
girl&#39;s back and Kaira&#39;s did the same. And just as Yuki began to 
settle into it, their kiss ended. Kaira pulled back and smiled.

&quot;I love you, Yuki.&quot;

These two had known each other for a while. And Yuki had been 
longing to hear those words for as long as she could remember. 
When Kaira saw the sudden wetness in Yuki&#39;s eyes she could see 
that this was the case. But she didn&#39;t mind at all. She just 
held the Kuragama-girl tight and thanked whatever it was that 
was giving her these new powers and abilities. 

 ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kaira has a new spring in her step. 

No one could blame her.

In one short day she had put her overbearing, perverted bully 
Motoko in her place and declared her love for the one true woman 
her heart. Yuki. So many things were going her way now. But it 
made her wonder. Just what was causing it? As the girl walked 
down the quiet residential road that led to the Phoenix Hill 
Shrine, she had to ask herself this. What was the secret behind 
her newfound strengths of body and character? In some weird way, 
she felt that it was connected to the Phoenix Hill Shrine and 
her grandfather. Ever since she had gone to the shrine 
yesterday, she had been feeling like this. And although her 
memories of what happened at the shrine were hazing, something 
inside was telling her that if she wanted an explanation for all 
that was happening to her, she would find it at the shrine. 
Though Kaira would have much preferred to spend some more time 
with Yuki and talk about what they had on their minds, this 
issue probably couldn&#39;t wait. 

Before she knew it, Kaira&#39;s sandals were clicking against the 
tall set of stone steps leading up to the imposing Phoenix Hill 
Shrine.  She hopped up to the main clearing of the place and 
looked around for Oburo, her grandfather, who could normally be 
found sweeping up the place in that drab way he always did. 

&quot;Grandpa!?&quot; Kaira yelled, hands to her mouth, &quot;Are you home?&quot;

No answer. 

That was odd. As Kaira recalled last time, he was always around. 
In fact Oburo had actually snuck up on her. Though the 
blonde-brunette doubted she would fall for that again. Kaira 
walked forwards and looked around the shrine. He had to be here. 
It was agreed that they would meet with each other at this time 
during the day. So where was he? Kaira strode over to the shrine 
innards at the middle of the precinct. She climbed the 
three-step flight of stairs and put her hand to the sliding 
wooden door. She slid it to one side and then walked inside, her 
eyes widening with utter urgency at the sight she was seeing.

&quot;Grandpa!&quot;

It was Oburo. Face down and battered. His kimono was shredded in 
over eight places, his pasty grey hair was in disarray, and his 
body was trembling vividly. Trembling was good. Trembling meant 
alive. But Kaira didn&#39;t show any of that relief in her face. She 
was too shocked by seeing her grandfather in this state. The 
Yatagami-girl ran over to the old man and quickly crouched down 
to inspect the damage done to him. 

&quot;Grandpa?&quot; She spoke, &quot;Are you okay? Say something! Grandpa!&quot;

...Of course, the condition of her grandfather was about to be 
one of the least important issues to deal with. As the voice of 
a dark shadowy figure soon took the fold...

&quot;The old man didn&#39;t provide much sport,&quot; Spoke the voice, 
&quot;Japanese Fighters tend to be more skill than brawn. But in the 
case of the old guy... he possessed a lack of both.&quot;

Kaira&#39;s shaking blue eyes looked up to the corner of the room. 
Just where that chilly voice was coming from. And she saw a 
Chinese man. He was tall and muscular; but in most ways 
lithe-looking. He was dressed in rich Chinese fighting garments, 
beaming the great colours of green, gold and purple. With his 
arms crossed and a superior smirk on his cunning face, this 
arrogant fighter jerked his head around, tossing his braided 
ponytail over his shoulder. 
One new power Kaira had was the ability to sense the aura of 
fighters. And this power was showing itself to her now. Because 
she could plainly see the smouldering strength of this man. It 
was amazing. He was no ordinary fighter. His dark gold Chi was 
so thick and strong that Kaira could feel its power deep in her 
heart. 

&quot;Who are you?&quot; She asked swiftly.

&quot;In Japan they call me &#39;Kuroichi&#39; (Black One),&quot; He responded, 
&quot;But in my native homeland of China, I go by the name Shen Lee.&quot;

So that was his name. &quot;Why have you done this? What on earth 
could my grandfather have done to deserve this? Tell me now!&quot;

Shen Lee smirked at the girl, tilting his head to one side. &quot;You 
are in no fit position to be barking out the orders, little 
woman. My presence here is my own business. But considering that 
I&#39;d like to carryout my orders with little fuss, I&#39;ll make one 
of my intentions known. I&#39;m looking for a certain statue. A 
statue of a phoenix.&quot;

&quot;A statue?&quot; Such a thought reminded Kaira of something. That 
rang a bell. She could recall that when she came to the shrine 
yesterday, there was a statue involved. But something had 
happened with that statue. Something that was connected to her 
powers now. But what was it? What had happened with that statue?

Shen Lee sneered. &quot;That&#39;s right. You must know something about 
it. Speak up. Because I have no qualms about doing to you what I 
did to your old man. Now talk.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d never tell you anything!&quot; Kaira shouted in return, &quot;Not 
after what you&#39;ve done to my Grandpa!&quot;

The Chinese martial artist heaved a sigh and untangled his arms. 
He shortly after cracked his knuckles aggressively. Looked like 
he wasn&#39;t kidding about the extremes of his will to find the 
Phoenix Statue. Something Kaira was about to discover for 
herself. Shen gave her one quick sneaky smile and acted. His leg 
extended from his hips like a bullet, and nailed Kaira straight 
across the face. The girl screamed as she was thrown backwards; 
her body smashing through the wood of the far wall. It shattered 
into splinters and Kaira was hurled into the outside with a kind 
of brutality that came only to those who walked willingly upon 
the edge of madness. He torso rolled backwards until it came to 
a stop. Kaira opened her eyes and took a deep breath, feeling 
blood rush down from her cheek. That kick was so fast she could 
barely register it.

Shen Lee somersaulted through the jagged hole that Kaira had 
made through the wall and flipped out into the courtyard along 
with her. He landed poised, with great polish and skill. But his 
devious intent prevented Kaira from respecting that strength. 
The girl wiped the blood from her face and frowned. She then 
stood upright and assumed a fighting stance. Not from knowledge. 
She hadn&#39;t had a day of martial arts training in her whole life. 
But the more she acted the more she felt like she was beginning 
to understand her new powers. 

Shen Lee watched this with amusement. &quot;Stupid girl. Even if you 
are trained in martial arts, what good could a feeble girl like 
you do? I am Shen Lee. The ultimate master of Yin-Li Style Kung 
Fu. The Kuroichi. Challenging me is a one-way ticket to the 
underworld.&quot;  

But by now Kaira was too angry about what had been done to her 
grandfather to care about the warnings and the dangers. The 
blonde-brunette pulled one hand to her side and lunged ahead at 
the taller Chinese man. Zeroing in on him. Kaira shot a punch at 
him. Shen Lee smirked and dodged to one side of the punch. Kaira 
then followed up with a sharp kick, snapping from the knees. 
Shen Lee ducked under it before it could even strike his head. 
And then made a little reprisal. The Chinese man thrust his fist 
straight into Kaira&#39;s stomach. The girl jerked in motion and 
gasped with the shock and force of the punch. Shen Lee swiftly 
pulled back that hand and spun his body around with split-second 
timing. His leg rose with him during the motion. And rammed 
straight into Kaira&#39;s jaw again. The teen was knocked up from 
her feet like a leaf. She then tumbled backwards and rolled into 
the flagstones of the shrine courtyard again. With his right leg 
still outstretched and his arms crossed behind his back, 
Kuroichi smirked at the downed woman. 

&quot;Amateur!&quot; He remarked. 

Blood stained the ground again in drips. But not from the first 
gash. A second cut was made at the bottom of her jaw. Kaira 
groaned and struggled back up to her feet. Suddenly she was 
worried about what she might have gotten herself into. Even 
though all of her senses and strengths had been enhanced since 
yesterday, Shen Lee was still faster and stronger than her. But 
there was no turning back now. Before she knew it she was back 
onto two solid feet. Kaira wiped the blood away from her face 
again and looked over at Shen Lee. Maybe she could attack him 
from a different angle to get a better shot at him. Kaira 
confirmed the plan and then began the motions. She ran ahead 
again. But stopped before she even got into an attacking range. 
She turned around, mid-stride, and then vaulted upwards into the 
warm afternoon air. Shen Lee&#39;s dark eyes followed the action 
keenly. Kaira rotated midair and came back down with one leg 
aimed for Shen Lee&#39;s head again. The Chinese man grinned at this 
and pushed back a little. Kaira blinked with urgency as Shen Lee 
drifted backwards like a flower in the wind. Then rushed back 
ahead with all the strength of that wind. The girl was knocked 
out of the aerial attack with one vicious punch into the 
stomach. The gust in Kaira&#39;s tank was bombarded again with 
another kick across the face. Then Shen Lee thrust another fist 
straight across Kaira&#39;s cheek. Then again with the other. Five 
more blows were delivered before Kaira was sent straight back 
into the stone of the shrine courtyard again. The teen coughed 
on the dust that was awaken as she slid over the worn 
flagstones. And Shen Lee just laughed at her efforts, both arms 
crossed behind her back in that intimidating way.

He smirked at the downed girl. &quot;...Your techniques are similar 
to the old man&#39;s. But you have none of endurance. He needed a 
good twenty more blows before he was reduced to that state.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... not... done... yet...&quot; Kaira retorted, now breathing 
heavily. 

&quot;I guess I should finish this off before I end up killing you.&quot; 
Claimed the arrogant Shen Lee. He smiled once more and pulled 
his hands away from his back. Then he began gathering some 
strength into them. His demeanour remained stoic... but his 
hands started to shake a little. An energy of great ancient 
significance began to encircle them. Then sparks of thin blue 
lightning surrounded that energy. He was about to do something 
bigger than what Kaira had seen so far. But what could she do 
about it? Attacking Shen Lee was not getting her anywhere. His 
skills definitely equalled his audacity and bravado. Even with 
all her new powers... she stood no chance against the likes of 
him. But it was at this point that Kaira began to remember 
things. She remembered about what happened yesterday. The 
phoenix statue. She touched it... and it broke. And then there 
was this huge gust of flames that rose up from the wreckage. 
Those flames. The flames of the Phoenix. 

...Jann Mei...

Shen Lee watched the now silent Kaira as she started to stand 
up. But his attack was ready now. Time to put the little woman 
in her place. The Chinese fighter pulled his hands apart and 
then thrust them both forwards, his body sliding back a little 
from the action.

&quot;Hasuhanasenko!&quot;
(Lotus Blossom Flash!)

Though the attack was beautiful in both name and action, it held 
ruthless powers. An energy blast was cast flashing the colours 
of red, green and yellow with brilliant speed and light. It 
zoomed over the flagstones and closed the gap between Shen and 
Kaira. The girl looked up as the blast encroached and went for 
the last escape. Kaira jumped straight upwards into that sky 
again. The Hasuhanasenko flew under her airborne feet with the 
escape. And the blast continued until it smashed into one of the 
surrounding stone walls of the shrine. There was a loud and 
vibrant explosion. Flames shot up from that battered wall. But 
Shen Lee&#39;s looks turned to the girl in the air. Something was 
wrong. In that condition, she could not have been able to dodge 
that attack. But when he looked up at her he began to understand 
just what was going on. Kaira floated in the air now, gravity 
was not bringing her back down. And a bestial howl broke out of 
her throat. One so loud it could be heard throughout all the 
shrine. Her normally blue eyes turned the colour of complete 
pearl white. Then hot burning flames burst all over her hands. 
Kaira descended back to ground level and landed in another 
fighting stance. 

Finally, Shen Lee lost his composure. &quot;Now I see why the old man 
wouldn&#39;t tell me the location of the statue! It&#39;s already 
broken! You possess Jann Mei!&quot;

But Kaira said nothing. Now she was aware of what was giving her 
these powers. The great phoenix spirit, Jann Mei. She could hear 
the voice of the warm, motherly entity deep inside her. And knew 
that Jann Mei wanted her to defeat Shen Lee. They had to fully 
integrate their powers into one. To work together fully by means 
of that sacred technique. The Phoenix Dance. Kaira&#39;s body heat 
grew to enormous levels as she began a small and composed dance 
of elegant strides. Her steps were quick and her movements were 
smooth, leaving Shen Lee with more questions than he had 
answers. And when that dance came to a end, a huge surge of 
force was spread outward from Kaira. It took on the form of a 
gust. Which blew dust off the surface of the flagstones and 
forced Shen Lee backwards. The Chinese fighter forced his feet 
into the ground and stopped himself from being blown back. His 
focus on standing his ground made him unaware of the 
bullet-speed charge that Kaira made. She came into his defences 
and caught him right off guard. Shen Lee gasped as one of 
Kaira&#39;s flaming hands swung by her in the form of a fist. He 
just about managed to avoid it and stepped away for a better 
grasp on the situation. Kaira followed him along a threw another 
punch his way. Shen avoided this as best as he could. But it 
left him right open for a third strike. Kaira grinned and shot a 
kick straight upwards, tilting her body back. Shen Lee&#39;s head 
jerked back violently from the kick and for the first time, was 
sent straight into the ground. The Chinese man skidded back and 
he clawed his fingers into the ground to stop himself. 

&quot;What is this?!&quot; Shen Lee yelled, &quot;How can you have this much 
control over it?!&quot;

Kaira spoke but maintained her stance. &quot;She&#39;s my guardian. My 
partner. And now my friend. I&#39;ll never let you have Jann Mei. No 
matter what your reason may be.&quot;

Shen Lee scowled. He could feel that Kaira was still a little 
weaker than he was, but the odds would be far more even in this 
battle. And he couldn&#39;t risk getting into a prolonged battle 
with a civilian. He stood up and dusted his now scuffed 
garments. 

Kuroichi stepped back with an angry expression on his face. 
&quot;...I&#39;ll let you go for now. Now that the phoenix has joined 
with a human... it&#39;s useless. But I have my own scores to settle 
with you, little woman. You&#39;d better expect to see me again 
because this isn&#39;t the end! It&#39;s just the beginning!&quot; 

With that said, Shen jumped backwards with all his mighty 
agility. And he kept doing so until he was over the left wall of 
the shrine. Kaira lowered her hands. The flames began to fade 
with them. Shen Lee was gone. But she now knew where her new 
powers had come from. She had merged with the phoenix spirit, 
Jann Mei. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;How are you feeling, Grandpa?&quot;

Night had fallen on the Phoenix Hill Temple. As soon as Shen Lee 
vanished to the darkness from which he had arisen, Kaira went to 
tend to her grandfather. She carried him off to bed and let him 
get a few hours sleep. While he rested, she went about the 
shrine and set herself on cleaning up the mess that Shen Lee had 
made of the place. They&#39;d need a new wooden screen for the 
damage done in certain places, but that shouldn&#39;t cost too much 
or take too long. Soon enough, Kaira went back into her 
grandfather&#39;s room to inspect his condition. He was now awake. 
And looking a lot better than he did before. 

Oburo held a hand to his head. &quot;L-Little Kaira?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; She nodded, &quot;It&#39;s me, Kaira. How are you? Are you okay? 
Do you need anything?&quot;


Not much. &quot;I don&#39;t think so, my dear. This old fool is tougher 
than he looks. So when did you get here? You didn&#39;t come 
across... him did you?&quot;

&quot;Do you mean that Chinese fighter, Shen Lee?&quot; Kaira nodded to 
her Grandpa, &quot;I did. And I even fought with him. He would have 
defeated me... but he ran off before he got the chance to do 
so.&quot;

&quot;...I see...&quot;

Kaira looked downwards. &quot;Grandpa. I have something to tell you. 
Yesterday...&quot;

&quot;...You broke the phoenix statue,&quot; Oburo filled in, &quot;then a huge 
bird of flame arose from the shards of the statue and found a 
solitude inside of you. This event gave you powers that you are 
struggling to understand... but feel unnervingly comfortable 
with.&quot;

He got it in one. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry. This is all my fault.&quot;

Oburo shook his head at the girl and places a firm hand upon her 
shoulder as she sat next to him upon that thin bed of his. 
&quot;Never think that, Kaira. All things happen for a reason. You 
were destined to break that statue. And the phoenix was destined 
to find a home within you. It has been the way of the Yatagami 
Family since ancient times. We are the guardians of the phoenix. 
Our fighting style was created for the sole purpose of 
protecting the spirit from the harms and ills of the world. Now 
that duty has been passed to you. You must use your new powers 
wisely. And use this power to avert... disaster.&quot;

&quot;Disaster?&quot; Kaira absently repeated. 

&quot;The man called Shen Lee was just a drone,&quot; Oburo answered, &quot;A 
tool for a higher power that has interests in the spirits for 
unknown reasons. A friend of mine, Tetsuya, has told me 
something that troubles me. You must help him and his daughter 
to rectify these problems. With the power of Jann Mei.&quot;

Kaira blinked. &quot;What are you talking about, Grandpa?&quot;

&quot;Kaira...&quot; Oburo smiled at her, knowingly, &quot;It&#39;s time for you to 
go to Tokyo...&quot;
