<p>“Saturn’s rings: endless”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Captain Kaori Chuunaru had been kept very busy since  the terrorist incident aboard the Space Station. Of the few still  alive (and the fewer still left in one piece), she had to arrest,  process, and imprison, and once that was finished, she was asked to  lead a preemptive attack into their main base. Chuunaru swept them  away like dust, killing and arresting hundreds more; not a day passed  before she was pulled out to solve a labor protest that had turned  ugly. She joined up with three other Captains to quash the Green  Eagle pirates once and for all, prevented the destruction of a vital  Lennethium factory, and even helped negotiate an Elshyrin territorial  conflict. This would have exhausted any normal officer, but Kaori  pressed on tirelessly, motivated by an unknown source that gave her  such raw energy.</p>
<p>Whatever dishonor she had allowed herself in the Space  Race had been overshadowed by her accomplishments, and her superiors  took these labors into consideration when they proposed a promotion  to the military council. They argued that, while Chuunaru was still  young and inexperienced, her actions had given her strength and  reputation, so much so that people’s faith in the UCM was gradually  being restored. Astor agreed that in spite of Chuunaru’s age, a  promotion was long overdue, but she would first have her superiors  reward her with a vacation while she deliberated.</p>
<p>“Once she’s finished with her current mission, I  mean,” she added. Kaori was patrolling Helios 6 right now, on the  lookout for Orihalcum smugglers. Gas planets were known to thrive  with the rare, floating material, and Helios 6— Saturn to the  natives— was one of the largest. Coincidentally, its moon Dione was  a resort spot, so perhaps Chuunaru could stop there once she  completed her search.</p>
<p>“It’s settled, then,” Astor said to Kaori’s  superiors. “Inform the Captain of these developments and relieve  her accordingly. A reprieve is the least we can do for her.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“I understand, sir. Thank you for informing me. I  will report once I’ve completed my run.”</p>
<p>“The <em>Instinct</em> will relieve you at 0600 hours  tomorrow, which should give you time to have a relaxing breakfast.  Dione is a good place to unwind; you deserve it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t feel tired, sir, but it’s an opportunity  I won’t pass down. Again, thank you for everything.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t my doing, Captain,” he replied with  quiet pride. “You’ve been working hard. Take your time relaxing,  and congratulations— premature congratulations.” Kaori let out a  deep breath, then resumed her work. She found the main transmitter  and turned it on.</p>
<p>“Attention, crew, this is your Captain. At 0600 hours  tomorrow, the <em>Neo Yamato</em> will be relieved of its duties and  will dock at Dione. You will be given shore leave for approximately  one week, unless noted otherwise. This does not give us permission to  slacken our duties, so stay sharp and keep an eye out. That is all.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Kaori didn’t realize how weary she was until she got  to her hotel room and laid down on her bed. The next thing she knew,  it was 1500 in the afternoon: she had slept for six hours straight  and didn’t even realize it. After reviving herself with a shower  and a late lunch (she was ravenously hungry), Kaori stepped outside,  squinting in the artificial sunlight. The star called Helios was so  distant that it cast no natural light upon Saturn or its moons; there  was no “day” here, only perpetual night, and only a small orb the  size of a period in the night sky indicated there was ever a sun at  all. For outsiders unadjusted to being so far away from a star,  walking underneath artificial sky and daylight was eerie, but Kaori  was unaffected.</p>
<p>Only six of Saturn’s moons were populated; the rest  were either too small or too prone to intense meteor showers from the  planet’s legendary rings. Titan had the greatest population (and  size), but it had been devoted to Saturnian research and exploration,  along with Mimas; Iapetus was only half-populated, while Rhea and  Tethys were used solely for their massive ice deposits: miners lived  there year-round harvesting the precious material. Dione had craters  with ice deposits, but most of its surface was livable, provided  certain constructions were created. Thanks to the abundance of frozen  water, people could eke out a relatively normal existence on Dione,  even though everything— from the temperature to the sky to the  beaches— was made by hand and not nature. Since the Helios system  was one of the largest in the known galaxy, tourist spots were hard  to come by in the outer worlds, and so Dione, in spite of its general  mediocrity, was one of the best. Merely touring the moon by herself  consumed the entire day, and when night came, Kaori found herself  exhausted once more. After a quick, simple dinner and a ride on a  bus, she went back to her hotel and slept until dawn.</p>
<p>Kaori’s weariness rubbed off completely as she rose,  exercised, showered, ate, and stepped outside just in time to catch a  simulated sunrise. Discovering she had slept most of the day  yesterday was a shock, and now she was determined to make up for all  that lost time. By now she had explored most of Dione and knew her  way around; she visited the shops first, determined to bring back at  least one unique souvenir. She took a yacht ride, spotted a manta ray  and a manatee, and went scuba-diving, all before lunch. Kaori found a  nice outdoor café close to the beach, and since she was on vacation,  she decided to attend in her swimsuit (her <em>new</em> swimsuit, no  less), which was perfectly acceptable and even encouraged. She felt  exposed sitting there in her bikini, still a little wet, but also  amazingly empowered, and even a little sexy.</p>
<p>“Maybe doing this once in awhile won’t be so bad  after all,” she mused. As she sat waiting for her meal, basking in  the heat and warmth of a manmade sun, Kaori thought she saw someone  familiar pass by and sit two tables down. She stared intently, trying  to clear up the blurry memory of a past meeting. As if sensing her  attention, the person turned around, forcing Kaori to glance away  quickly. She didn’t need to be embarrassed, though: it was someone  she knew fairly well.</p>
<p>“Captain Chuunaru,” the woman announced, rising to  join her. It was Shandra Hill, whom Kaori had worked alongside  before: once on New Manhattan and once in Centania, during the Race.  She relaxed her shoulders and welcomed the older woman to her table.  “Fancy meeting you here,” she smirked. “You never struck me as  the bikini type, you know.”</p>
<p>“A friend of mine convinced me to go through with  it,” she muttered, crossing her arms. Shandra, a blonde somewhere  between ten and fifteen years Kaori’s senior, had much more  sensible clothing on: khakis and a button-down dress shirt, sandals  and a belt, and shades raised on her head. She grinned and backed  down.</p>
<p>“I never said you looked awful. It’s a refreshing  change of pace for you. You know, I believe this is the first time  we’ve met face to face— well, without our occupations getting  between us.”</p>
<p>“You’re on vacation too?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a long-deserved one. I had a job on Europa and  swung by here to take a breather. You?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been busy ever since that incident on the  Space Station. Have you heard abut that?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’m amazed that everything turned out  so well.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I think you have that niece of yours to thank  for that— partially. I heard her group was in the middle of all  that. It’s…Rebecca, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m surprised you remember. Actually, I heard  from her before I arrived on Europa. We had a lot to discuss.”  Kaori hummed quietly and the conversation dissolved. Their orders  came— the waitress was a little confused with Shandra’s change of  tables— and they ate in silence. After clearing a third of her  plate, Shandra looked up at Kaori and watched her relish her meal.  Her eyes were peaceful, her face was calm, and her muscles were  loose: classic signs of a woman having a good time. She couldn’t  help but smile.</p>
<p>“You look like you just got laid.”</p>
<p>She got a face full of beer for her humor. A coughing,  red-faced Kaori apologized and offered her napkin.</p>
<p>“What makes— kff— you say that?”</p>
<p>“Well, you just looked so serene. I’ve seen that  face before, you know. I’ve worn it myself.”</p>
<p>“I’m just enjoying a long-overdue vacation,” she  muttered. Shandra raised her eyebrow.</p>
<p>“But surely by now you’ve… Ah, so you haven’t!  Don’t glower at me! Ever since we first crossed paths, I’ve only  wished for your happiness! You’re one of the few military dogs I  actually like, so it’s not unusual for me to wish you well.”</p>
<p>“There’s more to happiness than sex,” Kaori  grumbled.</p>
<p>“Yes, but love is one of its pillars. Don’t tell me  you’ve been so busy that you haven’t even had the <em>opportunity</em> to…”</p>
<p>“I did, once, actually,” she murmured, asking for a  refill. “It didn’t go so well.”</p>
<p>“She must’ve been brain-dead to turn you down,”  Shandra murmured. Kaori choked this time and took awhile to recover.  Shandra just sighed to herself. Chuunaru was a fine woman and an  excellent commander, but when it came to matters of the heart, she  was a greenhorn.</p>
<p>“And what makes you think it was a woman— ”</p>
<p>“Just observations,” she shrugged. “Am I wrong?”  Kaori stewed in frustration for a long time before answering.</p>
<p>“No.” Shandra backed away and decided to sympathize  with her.</p>
<p>“Want to talk about it? I understand heartbreak  fairly well. Don’t worry, your secrets are safe with me.”</p>
<p>“It’s personal,” she grumbled.</p>
<p>“I understand,” she replied defensively, “I’m  just offering to listen. I’ve got my share of horror stories if you  want us to be even.”</p>
<p>“I’ll bet they’re not as humiliating,” she  mumbled. Now Shandra was intrigued. She leaned forward and pushed her  glass of beer aside.</p>
<p>“Now you <em>have</em> to tell me.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“And you’re sure you’re okay? You weren’t hurt  at all?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Chandra replied, smirking  cleverly. “With a body like this, I was able to have my way with  those people. I seduced my way to safety and stayed hidden until it  was over.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like something you’d do.” Kaori  Chuunaru managed to smile, even though Chandra also flustered her. It  had been awhile since she had seen the exotic beauty…and then there  was that conversation she held with Yeriman… “Well, I’m glad  you’re safe. Oof…the same can’t be said about me, though.”</p>
<p>“Oh, goodness, were you hurt? Let me take a look!”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,” Kaori muttered, “just some  bruises. I got kicked pretty hard in the stomach during the  confusion, but this suit saved my life. Help me take it off, would  you?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” Chandra said, her voice trembling.  Once the armor was removed and stored away, Kaori sat on her bed and  stiffened as Chandra lifted her shirt. There was a very faint purple  blotch on her abdomen.</p>
<p>“This looks awful,” she whispered. “Let’s see  if we can’t make it better.”</p>
<p>“That’s not necessary,” Kaori muttered, but it  was no use arguing: Chandra had already leaned in and kissed the  battle-wound. Kaori felt like her sight was stolen away as bright  lights flashed in her eyes, and they became stronger and louder as  Chandra gently lifted her shirt further, unfastening her buttons and  exposing more skin. She half-kissed, half-massaged the wound, and  even though it was still tender, the pain was completely masked by  this seductress’ care. Kaori knew she would not be able to resist  Chandra’s advances; in fact, she would welcome them. She knew that  it would stir controversy, put her character into question, and might  even throw her position into jeopardy, but oh…she didn’t care,  she didn’t <em>care!</em> This felt so good, and she would never have  an opportunity like this, and she wanted to believe in her feelings  so much…</p>
<p>Her shirt came off, leaving Kaori to stare at the  pleasure unit in her plain white brassiere. Chandra’s clothes piled  around her knees as she gently laid Kaori on her back and crouched  down, trailing her lips up the ecstatic woman’s body. This was it.  It was really going to happen. Kaori stared into those expressive  green eyes for a timeless moment before pressing her mouth against  Chandra’s honeyed lips, drinking deep from a forbidden pool.</p>
<p>“I love you,” she whispered. Chandra smiled in  spite of her mounting conflict and reached around to unhook Kaori’s  bra.</p>
<p>“I love you, too.” Then all of a sudden, the dream  was broken, the fantasy was finished, and Kaori was left in the cold.  She opened her eyes slowly, not sure if this was a game, and was  surprised to find Chandra crying. Myths abounded that pleasure units  were “only machines”, something like sexless robots that were  created for military vessels to curb sexual misconduct amongst  officers. That some were more human than their creators envisioned—  or even that they could show emotion, and go against their  programming— proved that these were no mere machines, but living  creatures, with fears and dreams all their own.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Chuunaru asked, instinctively  reaching out to her. At that moment, there was nothing inhumane about  Chandra at all.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this pathetic?” she sobbed, her voice  shaky as she wiped her face. “A pleasure unit who doesn’t want  sex— who questions her existence.”</p>
<p>“Everyone does at some point,” Kaori attempted.  Chandra smiled sadly and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Up until now, I’ve loved the look, the smell, and  the touch of other women’s bodies. Whether I massaged them, modeled  for them, made love to them, or just cooked for them, I was happy.  There was nothing wrong with what I did. That’s what I thought,  anyway— but then someone told me something I don’t think I’ll  ever forget.”</p>
<p>“What did they say?” Kaori whispered, putting her  clothes in order. Chandra sniffled and looked deep into her eyes. No  mistaking it at all: there was no separation or distinction between  them. Skin or silicon, they were as human— or rather, as <em>hnau</em>,  intelligent beings who governed themselves based on personal choice—  as human as anybody else.</p>
<p>“She told me that the way I lived my life was not  really love at all. I went from woman to woman, giving my heart out,  engaging in one sexual adventure after the other. She told me that  was not true love, and that my actions would make me feel empty  before long. O how right she was. I soon realized I never really  cared for any of them— not by more than the time we spent together,  anyway. As lustful as I might be, there’s never going to be anybody  that I…<em>love</em>.</p>
<p>“Even if I thrust myself into your arms, Kaori, I  can’t really love you, because I’ll just leave you behind for  another conquest— and then another— and then another! They have a  word for that, Captain! They call that kind of person a whore! And  that,” she hissed chillingly, “is not something I wish to be. I  do not want that at all. So please excuse me for wasting your time  and trailing you along. I can’t be with you because I won’t be  able to control myself— because you deserve better— and above  all, I want to experience real love, the kind I will never know. I’m  sorry.”</p>
<p>Kaori let her go without saying a word.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Oh, Chuunaru…how awful.” Shandra didn’t mean  to sound pitiful, but she couldn’t help but feel for the young  woman. “That’s one nasty precedent. I’ve never heard of a  pleasure unit refusing to have sex— especially if she had you! It  must’ve been faulty wiring.”</p>
<p>“No, I can understand her decision,” she murmured  maturely. “And now that I’ve had time to mull it over, I realize  she made the correct choice. I was being blinded by my passions and  fell victim to meaningless desire. It wouldn’t have gone anywhere  anyway. If it had been anybody else— I mean, someone I actually had  a chance of sharing my life with— then yeah, I’d be more  depressed. So don’t give me that look, please…even though it is a  little humbling.”</p>
<p>“Well, she must have been an exceptional unit to act  so prudently towards her partners. And I see what you mean. I’ve  thrown myself at strangers too hastily at times, and I’ve regretted  it almost every time. I don’t think I’ve ever been with anybody I  really <em>loved</em>.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s toast to confusing relationships and  regrets made on both sides.” Tthey smiled and raised their glasses,  then finished their meal and went for a walk. Kaori didn’t want to  dwell on her sexual abortion, but now that it had been brought up,  she couldn’t help but think about it. Then again, in her line of  work, it was unheard-of for officers of higher rank to ever really  “find” someone to love: it would always and forever be business  first with her. Nobody deserved to be thrust aside “for later”,  even if the lives of thousands or millions were at stake.</p>
<p>That’s right: Kaori would never know true love as  long as she put her duty first. She had spent a large portion of her  life coming to terms with this truth, and now accepted it  unflinchingly. And Shandra… What about her? Did she feel the same?  Or did she struggle on in spite of the evidence stacked against her?  She didn’t look defeated or resigned to her fate. Her face was as  serene as Kaori’s— possibly because she was enjoying herself as  well.</p>
<p>“Thanks for this,” Kaori smiled, relaxing even  further. “I’m glad to have some company. It’s not often I allow  myself to loosen up.”</p>
<p>“You call this loose?” Shandra muttered, smiling  subtly. She took her sandals off and waded into the artificial ocean,  groaning in disappointment. “It’s nothing like the real thing.  It’s been years since I’ve felt real sand and surf on my toes.”</p>
<p>“I grew up near the ocean, you know— Okinawa of  Japan, Helios,” Kaori gestured. She smiled and kicked a little  water on her companion. “This stuff is an insult to the real thing.  Whoops.” She stumbled into the water and got back up. “Darn, I’m  tipsy. You did this to me on purpose, encouraging me to drink all  that beer.”</p>
<p>“Good thing you were wearing a bikini!” she  grinned. Shandra was also a bit lightheaded, though she could handle  her liquor better than Kaori. She tripped and got her khakis wet;  Kaori laughed and threw a bigger handful of water at her. “Hey, go  easy! I’m wearing normal clothes.” Kaori had a beautiful smile,  though, and Shandra couldn’t help but mirror it. She gave Kaori a  gentle push which, in her condition, sent her falling into the water.  She laughed quietly and knelt down to help her up, but instead, Kaori  pulled her down with her, soaking her. They both laughed and blushed  a little as they realized just where this romp led them to. Shandra  reached out and wiped away a few strands of Kaori’s wet hair.</p>
<p>“You know,” she whispered with as much clarity as  she could muster, “maybe we could help each other out.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Her heart started to race; she  felt warm in spite of the water.</p>
<p>“Just…maybe…I could show you just how good it is—  you know, what you’re missing out on. I mean, you wouldn’t be  doing it with a stranger. I like you and I care about you. Maybe for  once, I could feel what it’s like, too. It’s certainly something  to think about— and I have <em>no idea</em> where this is coming  from, but…I mean, if you’re interested…”</p>
<p>“Y-you’re not serious,” Kaori muttered, glancing  away timidly. “You’re drunk, Hill: we both are.”</p>
<p>“I am serious,” she said, although it was true she  wasn’t entirely sober. “I’ve actually thought about it. I won’t  force you, of course, but I think it would be great for both of us.”</p>
<p>“It couldn’t even work out,” Kaori floundered.  The more aroused she got, the more objections she tried to pose.  “You’re a bounty hunter and I’m a military figurehead. We might  even end up fighting each other in the future. It’s…not like I’m  repulsed, but…”</p>
<p>“I know what you mean. We both have separate worlds  we live in. I’m not saying we could make a relationship out of it.  Just…think of it as a one-night stand that carries over. We’re  both on vacation, right?” Shandra slipped away and helped Kaori  stand. Having their sea-soaked bodies pressed so close together had  fired their lusts and delayed their sanity, and now the clear air was  coming back and they had some time to reflect on what had happened.  To curb this clarity, Shandra suggested they go to her hotel room to  change clothes. Kaori had a feeling there was an ulterior motive  behind this offer, but she was too tipsy, too excited, and too  curious to refuse.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Without the slightest hint of bashfulness, inhibition,  or hesitation, Shandra unbuttoned her shirt as soon as she stepped  inside the hotel room. Kaori was still in her bikini; she didn’t  expect to be caught so vulnerable, and was assaulted by fright and  glee, both sensations originating from the same possibility. Was she  going to be seduced? Was this Shandra’s way of “sealing the  deal”? Had their frolicking on the manmade beach been an excuse to  get close, get undressed, and explore a world they had only dreamed  about? How far back had Shandra been planning this, or fantasizing  about this moment? Kaori remembered all the beers Hill pushed on her,  and the way she peeled her own defenses down with that story of  failed love. More than any other thought, though, Kaori kept saying,  “this is really happening” in her mind, and, “she really means  to go through with it.” That she didn’t run, or raise a curtain  of modesty, or even feel an objection to the moment was indication  enough that she really did want this.</p>
<p>“I am going to be seduced by a beautiful, strong,  exciting woman,” she thought, and it paralyzed her with joy.  Shandra Hill was not the kind of person she would be ashamed of  throwing herself at: she respected her and even liked her. And why  not? Even for a night— even for a moment— didn’t she deserve  this? Kaori kept her sexuality in check because she knew distractions  were fatal in her line of work, and relationships rarely stood up to  the rigorous schedules and demands. You could be killed or  transferred at any moment; nothing was certain. You could only count  on constant change and one-night stands. The Director was an  exception, of course, but hers was also a marriage of convenience:  she and Iona were partners <em>and</em> lovers. Kaori knew that this  would be the best chance she ever had of ever getting close to  anybody, and even though she was still nervous, she was glad to  accept Shandra’s invitation.</p>
<p>But words are slow: Hill had barely freed the last  button on her shirt when Kaori made her decision. She suddenly  realized her guest would have nothing to change into, and smiled  feebly. “Sorry, I guess we should’ve gone to your place instead.  But you can borrow something of mine if you want. We look like we’re  about the same size.”</p>
<p>“I’ve made a decision,” Kaori replied  spontaneously, and not very smoothly. “I…want to…um… Hill—  I mean, Shandra, what you said earlier, what you suggested… I, uh,  think that… I think I’m ready for…uh…”</p>
<p>“I can’t help you unless you tell me,” she  replied, smiling with great delight. She knew what Kaori meant but  wanted her to proclaim it. “You have to say exactly what you want.”  She took a deep breath.</p>
<p>“I want us…to be lovers. I want to…kiss you. I  want to hold…you, and…sleep next to you. M-maybe…you know…we  could take a shower together and— ”</p>
<p>“All in good time, my sweet Captain,” Shandra  whispered, approaching her in soaking, sand-crusted clothes. “I  want you to enjoy every minute…every second…every touch and  glance. I don’t want you to forget any of it. You deserve to feel  real love and real caresses, not to be fucked in three minutes like a  whore. I’m going to be slow and sensual…and you’re going to beg  for a release…and then I might give it to you, or I might not. It  all depends.”</p>
<p>As she talked she kissed Kaori’s neck, caressing her  calloused hands over the younger woman’s skin. Her muscles were  firm and well-defined— strong, but feminine, stronger and more  feminine than Shandra herself— she wondered if she would be able to  control her. Right now she had the upper hand. Chuunaru was a virgin,  a flower not yet blossomed, and was under the loving scrutiny of an  experienced woman, who knew exactly where, and when, and how to  pleasure her. Her lips pecked Kaori’s shoulders and her hands  forced Kaori’s wrists against the wall, pinning them so she was  utterly helpless. Familiar noises of delight and joy trickled from  her soft lips like liquid gold, melodies of encouragement, of  acceptance, of a long-sought desire now finally in her grasp. Shandra  knelt down and obeyed her most lustful desire so far, licking Kaori’s  tummy until it was covered with her saliva. She let go of her wrists  just long enough to remove her shirt.</p>
<p>There was no need to restrain her arms: Kaori was a  very willing student and resisted the urge to take control: she would  let Shandra do as she pleased, for now. She wanted to tear all their  clothes off, get naked, and wrestle on the ground— but that could  not happen, not yet, because it wasn’t what she needed. She cried  out as she felt a woman’s lips touch her cleavage, her chest, her  shoulders, and her arms: Shandra made oral love to her fingers and  rubbed her soaking brassiere against Kaori’s bikini top. Kaori  reached around and squeezed Shandra’s bottom, but her hands were  restrained again as Shandra grinned and, very slowly, reached her  tongue out to encircle Chuunaru’s gaping lips.</p>
<p>“Shandra, please…kiss me. Kiss me, please. I can’t  take it anymore.”</p>
<p>“Ssh.” The touch of her sultry breath was  electrifying. Kaori couldn’t describe what was happening to her.  The best she could come up with was a kind of destruction, a  deterioration of a part of herself— something integral and definite  was being taken away, replaced with another something that would  irreversibly change her. Kaori had only known dim, quiet, fleeting  pleasures until now, and few of them had been physical. Long baths,  fine meals, the embrace of friends, beating the wicked into  submission (she was perfectly permitted to enjoy hatred towards  evil)— and now sex, which trumped them all and drove her  deliciously insane.</p>
<p>By this time, Shandra’s khakis had been discarded as  neatly as the mood offered, so the lovers were now equally exposed.  After Kaori was worshipped with extensive kisses, she saw a pattern  emerging: Shandra was revealing herself first for Kaori to drink in.  This theory proved correct as their eyes met in smoldering lust, and  Hill removed her brassiere, exposing wonderfully firm, rounded  breasts, their rosy centers protruding with need. She did not even  touch Kaori as she disposed the final veil, standing before her naked  and beautiful, so still and strong that she resembled a sculpture  more than a lady.</p>
<p>The short patch of blonde hair surrounding her  womanhood drew Kaori’s attention as she gazed longingly at the Art;  she had never seen another woman fully nude before. The vision was so  exquisite that she would have been satisfied to stare all day long,  studying her lover’s body with care, if it were possible. But of  course, she was granted greater privileges than this, and soon— as  Shandra approached her like a lioness stalks its prey— she was  surrendered to her passions and stripped bare. Kaori tried to match  her lover’s brazen shamelessness, and if she had known how deeply  Shandra was affected by this front, she would’ve been greatly  encouraged and might have taken the lead.</p>
<p>Now came the real heaven. A pleasure so strong it  became painful— or pain so glorious she adored it— these  contradictions took over and pummeled her, even though Shandra was  being so gentle, so gentle. Their kisses were beautiful and  mesmerizing as they fluctuated from great intensity to slow, seething  softness. Kissing someone who is clothed and someone in the nude are  two different sensations, so when the two women first embraced and  let themselves go, Kaori was astonished. Their skin touched and they  seemed to unite as one; then, Shandra went to work, pulling Kaori  further and further towards the edge, where she would soon fall into  overwhelming ecstasy.</p>
<p>Shandra’s newfound love for Kaori opened up new  emotions and actions for her as well. She did things to this young  woman she had never done before to any of her previous lovers. She  lavished Kaori’s back with hands and lips; she treasured the  undersides of her breasts and arms; she licked her thighs and inhaled  the rich scent of her quivering waist. Kaori had no pubic hair to  speak of and the sight of her naked maidenhood set Shandra aglow. She  groaned as Hill pushed one finger into her rear and her other fingers  through her vagina, her mouth suckling Kaori’s nipples, and  instinctively clenched her muscles.</p>
<p>“Relax, lover,” she heard the older woman soothe.  “Just relax. Let it happen. Relax.”</p>
<p>“Uh…okay, I’ll try.” She covered her mouth so  she wouldn’t yell, shut her eyes, and leaned against the wall,  supporting herself with her free hand. This was unspeakably good.  Double penetration had not been a fantasy of hers but now she was  addicted. Shandra had vowed she would not take Kaori’s virginity  (in the strictest sense, anyway), but that still left them plenty of  room for fun. Eventually she fell over the edge, coming hard on the  other woman’s hand, her knees wobbling and her legs crumpling.  Shandra gently removed her fingers, sucking on a few, cleaning the  others with a rag. She drew close to Kaori and held her as she caught  her breath and descended from her nirvana.</p>
<p>“How was it?” she asked gently. Kaori smiled and  leaned over to kiss her.</p>
<p>“Better than I could’ve imagined. Better than  anything else I’ve ever done.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad.” She caressed the young woman’s hair  and, once she had recovered, helped her stand. “I think it’s time  we took a shower.” Kaori nodded.</p>
<p>“But then it’ll be my turn.” Shandra smiled  foxily and couldn’t wait to see what the young Captain had in  store. They wrapped their arms around one another and stared  longingly into each other’s eyes until the water was just right,  then stepped inside with a squeal: Kaori couldn’t resist slapping  her lover’s bottom. Now it was time for the student to show the  teacher what she had learned.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Kaori woke up once before dawn to find her lover still  asleep at her side, and smiled with contentment as she snuggled close  and went back to sleep. The next time she woke, it was already  morning, and Shandra was gone— evidently laying out their  breakfasts in the next room. The aroma of hotel food was strong  enough to get her out of bed; she put one of Shandra’s button-down  shirts on and went searching for her lover. Sure enough, Shandra was  in the den, and still mostly nude, clad only in her panties. The  sight of her was a delight that almost surpassed all of the others.  Discovering someone who had awakened a long-dormant part of your  personality now suddenly bathed in serenity was ethereal— almost  unreal. Kaori silently padded over and embraced the older woman from  behind. She had a pleasant scent and Kaori had been well acquainted  with it last night.</p>
<p>“Morning.”</p>
<p>“Morning to you,” Shandra smiled. There was only  fruit on the platter; she picked out a melon and put part of it in  her mouth, enticing Kaori to take the rest of it. Chuunaru then chose  a blueberry, trailing it over Shandra’s naked skin until she  pressed it through her lips. In this fashion they fed each other,  never breaking from their hug, milking the eroticism until the last  morsel had been taken. Kaori soon assumed the position of domination  that had always been hers to inherit, gliding soft fingers over  Shandra’s naked bosom as she gasped for pleasure. Slowly she knelt,  kissing down Hill’s spine until she met the small of her back.  Shandra opened her mouth to cry out as Kaori ran her tongue down the  back of her panties, but no sound came out— nothing except a soft  croak and a bright flash of wonder that blinded her. Kaori then moved  to the front, licking the silky material and driving Shandra  ballistic. She fell to the floor and surrendered herself; Kaori  peeled the underwear off and gorged on a second breakfast until  Shandra released herself, panting and murmuring.</p>
<p>“<em>Very</em> good morning,” Kaori purred as she  climbed up her weary lover’s body. Her shirt hung open and her  breasts wobbled like the apples of Hesperides, enticing Shandra to  take them. Kaori winced and straddled her lover’s face, becoming  naked so she could sing of her rapture. It got to the point where she  no longer cared who this was or what she was doing; the sex was too  wonderful for anything else to matter. She came powerfully and lay  wilted in her lover’s warm embrace, idly playing with Shandra’s  nipples. They remained at rest until Chuunaru recovered. She gave  Shandra an evil grin and, without a single word, maneuvered her body  so that both woman could mutually enjoy the other.</p>
<p><em>I think I’ve created a monster</em>, Hill grinned  to herself. The two women nearly went at it for the whole day, one  making up for lost experience and the other fulfilled beyond hope.  The only thing that concerned them was that they might never again  reach this sensational height, and that singular horror drove them to  greed, resuming their lovemaking until they were physically incapable  of moving. Sleep came easy but the morning would bring a change of  pace to their routine. When Kaori awoke again, neither sight nor  sound (nor smell) of Shandra Hill remained, and loneliness and fright  took control. Shandra was not so cruel as to leave her hanging,  however, and entrusted Kaori with money for her hotel room and a note  of explanation. Kaori knew what it was going to say but read it  anyway.</p>
<p><em>Captain— </em></p>
<p><em>By now you’ll notice I’ve left you to continue  my lifestyle. We both understood that this encounter could not last  for more than a few days, and we were willing to cherish the short  time together. You have made me happier and more fulfilled than  anything I can recall, save the comfort of my remaining family, and  for that you will have my eternal gratitude and love. A woman like  yourself will no doubt find even greater and worthier love than my  own; my only regret is that I can never give you what you really  deserve. I do hope our paths never cross in violence, but if they do,  I trust you will do the right thing. I’ve left my share of the  hotel bill, and a few spare clothes (we never had much use for them  did we!?), but after that, you’re on your own. Take care, my  friend, and may we both find the love we deserve. Until then, I shall  do all I can to “fight the good fight”. I know you won’t  disappoint me on your end.</em></p>
<p><em>Affectionately, Shandra</em></p>
<p>She folded it up and kept it. Shandra’s clothes fit  her better than she expected, and Kaori decided to keep them as she  returned to her own hotel and lived out the rest of her vacation in a  relaxed state. Once she returned to the ship, her subordinates  noticed the change and were happy for her, although the secret of her  euphoria was never discovered. No sooner did the <em>Neo Yamato</em> lift off from Dione’s orbit and part from Saturn did another  “urgent call” come in, as if it had waited until just after their  vacation ended. Kaori quickly cleared out the haze and adapted a more  businesslike stance, but even now, she looked like another person.  After all, she kept her smile in spite of the heavy workload before  her.</p>
<p>“<em>Neo Yamato</em>, prepare for Lennethium warp—  and for every other horizon we are destined to travel to.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It had been a wonderful vacation, but now it was time  for Shandra to get back to the real world. She hadn’t meant to stay  long, but sometimes people simply had needs that schedules and  obligations could not supersede. Kaori deserved no less, though she  certainly deserved better— but at least now she had some idea of  what it was like. Maybe in the future, she could find that special  someone. In any case, Shandra now had other matters to attend to.  Talking with her niece had opened several revelations, not the least  of which was the condition of her brother, Franklin. Shandra had  tried to love him, but in the end she was forced to show pity and  despair; at least now he could rest in peace. That meant her  sister-in-law was no longer bound by marital obligations to wait for  him, or even to stay on the Marlin Colony. She could at last be free,  and <em>Prince Mishkin</em> was the chariot that would bear her hence.</p>
<p>“I’m coming for you, Kaylee darling— and oh, we  have so much to talk about.”</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Sati: Hey, is it my turn next?</p>
<p>Kyle: Not yet. I hear you’ll get your shot on Gaea’s  moon.</p>
<p>Sati: Aww…I wanna have my moment NOW!</p>
<p>Marsa: You’ll be lucky if you get a few pages in this  story! I only showed up a few times! People probably don’t even  remember me!</p>
<p>Lord Demise, Jr.: That’s nothing! I barely got a few  paragraphs in! Boy, secondary characters get no respect in this  story!</p>
<p>Astor: That’s because the author’s trying not to  plug his own characters too much. Anyway, an emergency on Mars has  suddenly come up, and the crew of the <em>Dauntless </em>is the only  one that can handle it. Any “Doom” fans out there?</p>
<p>Marsa: I pray for their success.</p>
<p>Ferrara: You know, I’m sure I could help save the day.  I mean, I might be their rival but I’m not evil or anything! My  lover’s a frickin’ princess, for Pete’s sake!</p>
<p>Lord Demise, Jr.: Tune into the next chapter, “Red  Planet: the crimson flowers of death”, to see even MORE secondary  character neglect.</p>
<p>Kyle: Actually, I heard the Jackal and Changera make an  appearance.</p>
<p>Lord Demise, Jr.: Gurk!!</p>
<p>Sati: And sweet Ferrara might swoop in, too!</p>
<p>Ferrara: Awesome!</p>
<p>Lord Demise, Jr.: (groan) Me hate you all.</p>
