<h1>Journey's End (part 11 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/journend-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>The young woman sat down at her computer terminal,
easily logging into her email account. Sam Davis
looked kind of scruffy, though that was pretty normal
for her, dressed in a baggy sweatshirt and casual
pants, Her round glasses gleamed, as she waited
patiently, her long brown hair flowing down her back
in a neat braid.

The mail screen came up and she frowned, noticing so
much was in her bulk mail bin, opening the folder Sam
swiftly marked off files for deleting, only stopping
when she noted one of her regular on-line newsletters.
Finishing clearing out all of the spam she clicked on
the one useful file, her eyes widening in surprise.

&#39;Scandal in Romance publishing!&#39; the banner headline
read then the article continued, &#39;In a shocking
revelation, popular romance novelist Nicole Richards
has been revealed to be a lesbian. The &#39;National Star&#39;
has obtained photos and testimony revealing the sordid
details of her many affairs. Her publisher has
declined comment at this time...&#39;

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Sam murmured weakly. She skimmed the
article with a frown, but there wasn&#39;t much more
details there. She went to one of her usual media
bulletin boards, already finding a topic where it was
being discussed.

Several pieces of the upcoming article were already
posted up there, along with several clearly
recognizable photos of Ms. Richards and a gorgeous
brown haired woman, including at least one where they
were kissing romantically. The article named places
and dates, along with details of her private life that
made Sam blush, faintly.

Along with the news there was a heated debate going
on, some posters defending Nicole for being in the
closet while writing her heterosexual romance novels
while others were harshly condemning her for the
deception. Sam read the various points even as her own
thoughts raced, trying to decide how she felt about it
all. Finally, Sam came to a simple conclusion: it
didn&#39;t really matter to her. The books that she had
read were still the same, still good, even if the
writer herself wasn&#39;t the person Sam had thought she
was.

Sam jerked up as a thought zinged her, &#39;Does Ms.
Richards know that she&#39;s been outed?&#39; Quickly checking
the date on the posts she saw that they had only gone
up this morning, along with the email that she had
just gotten. She reached for the phone, thinking of
calling Ms. Richards, but realized she didn&#39;t have her
phone number.

&#39;Which doesn&#39;t leave me a lot of choices,&#39; Sam thought
wryly, getting up from her desk. The little car
rumbled ominously as Sam started it up, but it still
headed down the street at a good pace. She cut through
town, tempted to stop in to see her brother but
decided not too. &#39;He&#39;ll find out about Ms. Richards
soon enough,&#39; she thought glumly.

Out through the commercial zone then up the roads
towards the hills and the sea, the way getting
considerably worse as Sam continued. Finally with
great reluctance she turned onto the gravel road. A
pothole nearly threw her out of her seat and Sam grit
her teeth as she bumped and lurched her way up to the
little house.

Sam sat there in her old car for a moment, idly
wondering if this was really a very good idea, then
she got out, thumping the dented door shut behind her.
A peaceful breeze stirred her long hair away from her
face as she walked over to the wooden steps and up to
the front door. She took a deep breath to steady
herself, then knocked firmly.

It took a moment for someone to answer, and Sam
blinked in surprise at the sight. Nicole had a
cellphone to her ear, talking intently to someone as
she waved Sam inside. &quot;No, I don&#39;t want you to deny
it,&quot; she said crisply into the phone, &quot;there&#39;s not
much point, Max.&quot;

&quot;If you say so,&quot; Max rumbled dubiously. &quot;So who do you
think did it?&quot; he asked, loud enough for even Sam to
hear.

&quot;I don&#39;t think, I know who,&quot; Nicole made a face as she
continued irritably, &quot;I had Lynn up here just a few
days ago trying to get some money out of me. Once I
said no, I guess she decided to sell her story to the
papers instead.&quot;

&#39;Guess she knows,&#39; Sam thought wryly as she took a
seat, nervously wondering if the ghost was going to
pop out again.

&quot;Sounds like Lynn is trying to portray herself as an
innocent who was corrupted by an evil lesbian,&quot; Max
sounded amused.

&quot;Hey, she seduced me,&quot; Nicole protested.

Max nearly choked at that comment before laughing.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; he chuckled wickedly, &quot;I
advised a few reporter friends to check into her
background a bit, so she shouldn&#39;t get away with that
very long.&quot;:

&quot;Good to know,&quot; Nicole braced herself for bad news,
&quot;is this going to set back the release of the latest
book?&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;re going ahead,&quot; Max said, &quot;I figure any
publicity is good publicity.&quot;

&quot;Give me a break,&quot; Nicole groaned. She gave Sam an
apologetic smile as she asked, &quot;Can I call you back,
I&#39;ve got company.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Max answered cheerfully before hanging
up.

Nicole set the phone down, the redhead looking visibly
weary. &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; she gave Sam a tired smile.

&quot;I thought I should come up and make sure you knew,&quot;
Sam said hesitantly.

Nicole flashed her a grateful smile, &quot;That was kind of
you.&quot; She sat down with a soft thump in one of the
chairs, &quot;I got a wake-up call from a reporter I know a
few hours ago and my editor and I have been calling
back and forth ever since.&quot;

&quot;It really surprised me,&quot; Sam said, a hint of reproach
in her voice, &quot;when I read a preview of the article on
a fan-site.&quot;

Nicole smiled at her wryly, &quot;Whenever I had an
author&#39;s bio written I insisted that they not actually
lie about anything, but maybe I should have been more
honest.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Sam admitted thoughtfully after a
moment of thought, &quot;I mean, it&#39;s not like readers
expect to know all about the writers normally, so why
should a lesbian author reveal all?&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Nicole&#39;s smile was mildly self-mocking, &quot;but
even I have to admit that it is a bit odd that a
lesbian is writing straight romances.&quot; She actually
chuckled, &quot;Too bad I ended up being so good at writing
them, huh?&quot;

Sam smiled back, her eyes lighting up as she
remembered something. &quot;You were talking to your editor
about a new book?&quot; she asked eagerly.

Nicole almost laughed at the sudden switch, Sam&#39;s pure
eagerness showing in those wide eyes. &quot;Sent the
manuscript in a few days ago,&quot; she confirmed, &quot;the
latest in my series.&quot; She added mentally, &#39;And
probably my last.&#39;

&quot;Do you think,&quot; Sam beamed, &quot;I could read it first?&quot;

Nicole hesitated, then smiled, &quot;Just promise not to
show it to anyone,&quot; she said as she left the room. A
few minutes later she returned with a loosely bound
ream of sheets, the front page simply carrying the
title and Nicole&#39;s name.

&quot;I promise,&quot; Sam beamed as she took the sheets, &quot;thank
you, Ms Richards.&quot;

&quot;Call me Nicole,&quot; she smiled.

They talked for awhile, then Sam, clutching her book
like it was a treasure, headed out to her car and
drove off. She looked in the rearview mirror and her
eyes widened as she saw two women standing on the
porch, one solid and one... not.

Nicole smiled to herself wryly as she watched Sam go,
&quot;Hope the rest of my readers are as accepting as she
was.&quot;

She nearly jumped out of her skin as Laura spoke from
behind Nicole, &quot;If they love your work, I think they
will.&quot;

&quot;You get a perverse pleasure out of startling me,
don&#39;t you?&quot; Nicole turned to look at her blonde haired
lover with a smile.

Laura echoed that smile, the gown she wore fluttering
gently around her slim body. &quot;Well, yes,&quot; she
conceded.

&quot;Thank you for not scaring Sam this time,&quot; Nicole said
softly.

&quot;I do have some tact,&quot; Laura sounded amused. She
looked at Nicole, &quot;I still can&#39;t believe that someone
who claimed she loved you could do this.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t love,&quot; Nicole sighed as she leaned up
against the porch, &quot;Lynn&#39;s a user, she&#39;s just very
good at keeping you from figuring it out.&quot;

&quot;And how&#39;s Rachel taking this?&quot; Laura asked, keeping
her voice steady.

&quot;Spectacularly annoyed,&quot; Nicole actually chuckled,
&quot;especially when she found out that she was the one
who led Lynn up here.&quot;

Even Laura had to smile at that.
