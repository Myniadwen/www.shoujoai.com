<h1>Rival Rage 2: The Hitsujiko Corporation (part 7 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/rivrage2-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>It was a brilliant day. The burning sun was high in the sky, its beams 
of natural energy unhidden by the cloudless skies above. It was so 
unusual to see a sunny day in the throws of the early morning, very much 
a difference from normal cold dreary environment that Rinako had come to 
experience during her morning training. The amethyst-haired beauty was 
glad for this though. The brighter the sun was the more she felt 
uplifted. Maybe it was the convenience that gave her this feeling, or 
maybe that normal feeling of human perception, but this bright day 
really did make her feel happier. But then again, she really was not the 
focus at this point. It was Rei that Rinako was more concerned about.

Rinako stood back on the unseasonably warm grass of Mizube Ai Park; her 
honey-brown eyes fixed on her girlfriend Ayane and their &#145;disciple&#146; 
Reikibu Somenosuke Tsukuji. Like they had agreed, Ayane would help with 
Rei&#146;s training, despite her misgivings on the situation. Not that Rinako 
could blame her. Rai shou en ken was not a joke by any standard. The 
people who had come to wield its power knew clearly of its dangers. All 
it would take would be one mistake, and the lives of all those around 
were in literal jeopardy. But, unlike Ayane, Rinako knew Rei well enough 
to know that she was not ignorant. Reikibu knew full well of the power 
she would come to understand, and the responsibilities that needed to be 
carried as a result of using it. Anyway, Ayane didn&#146;t have much choice 
either way. And until the heat from the ruined talks blew over, there 
was not much for her to do. Teaching Rei would pass time, and, it would 
help Ayane to evaluate her own progress in Rai shou en ken.

Ayane stood in front of Rei, cross-armed, her golden eyes monitoring the 
younger girl from simple confusion. Rei was so delicate and so petite. 
Why would such a girl want to learn a fighting art?

&#147;Okay, Reikibu.&#148; Ayane began. &#147;I&#146;m sure Rinako had already told you 
this, but I will be assisting her in your training.&#148;

&#147;You know Ikatsuji-sensei&#146;s style too?&#148; Rei asked.

Ayane nodded. &#147;Right. I do. She and I... both trained together in the 
Ikatsuji Fighting Institution. Although that was a while ago now. I will 
be honest with you. I have reservations about teaching you the Rai shou 
en ken art, and with just cause, but if this is Rinako&#146;s wish then I 
can&#146;t really refuse.&#148;

Rei lowered her head in thanks. &#147;I&#146;m really grateful, Yosukube-sensei.&#148;

The new teacher, Ayane blinked surprised, ignoring Rinako&#146;s childish 
giggles from behind. Her love knew more than most that Ayane was never 
really used to being addressed as someone&#146;s superior. Sort of an odd 
trait for a gang leader, but then again, Ayane was no ordinary girl. 

&#147;Okay then, lets begin Reikibu. For starters, just tell me, what skills 
has Rinako taught to you? Maybe I should have asked this earlier, but I 
think I need to know now.&#148;

Rei thought for a second. Rinako really hadn&#146;t taught her very much. 
&#147;The majority of the time it was just strength training, stuff like laps 
around the school and daily drills with her. I haven&#146;t really learned 
anything other than that.&#148;

For a brief second, Rinako entered the conversation. &#147;I didn&#146;t think Rei 
was ready for something heavy, like Chi-attacks. I decided to strengthen 
her up a bit. And from the looks of her, I did just that.&#148;

Though Ayane wasn&#146;t completely convinced of that, Rei agreed with 
Rinako. Her power was growing. By small lengths, but all the same, it 
was still growing. Last night, Rei recalled pouring herself some water, 
then breaking the glass. Not by dropping it or knocking it, simply from 
grasping the glass. And even more astounding was that fact that Rei 
looked and seemed as she had always done, simple-mannered, frail and 
brittle. 

Ayane held a hand to her chin. &#147;I see. I suppose I&#146;ll have to start from 
the beginning then. Rinako and myself will instruct you. Her strength 
lies in her Chi-manipulation and body movement, while mine rests in 
contact fighting and throws. I suppose I&#146;ll brief you on the basics, 
simple fighting techniques, beginning with kicking assaults and punches. 
I will cross over into more complicated things when I feel that you are 
ready for them. As soon as you are ready for it, Rinako will instruct 
you in the more advanced levels of Chi-control. But not before I teach 
you a little about what Chi-energy means to us as martial artists.&#148;

Rei tried to take this all in as fast as she could. &#147;Uh... sure&#133;&#148;

&#147;Okay then.&#148; Ayane said. &#147;Lets begin.&#148;

**********
 
Kozue Takami (Note, if you can&#146;t remember who Takami is, look back over 
at chapter 2 of RR2) studied the proud business building with bright 
eyes of wonder and delight. It had been quite a while since he had last 
seen the Hitsujiko Corp&#146;s main building. Two years, eight months, three 
weeks and four days ago to be precise (not that he was counting or 
anything&#133;). And after all that time, the place hadn&#146;t changed a lick. 
The double-glazed glass, decorative plants, pearly white carpets, the 
odd thuggish security guard here and there. It was exactly the same as 
it had always been, at least in Takami&#146;s opinion. It wasn&#146;t like he had 
fond memories of the Hitsujiko building, so why on earth did he remember 
its design? Had to be some of that blasted Takami family memory. Still, 
it *was* the Takami family that was behind all the glitz and glimmer of 
this building. There was a proud dignity within the annuls of the Takami 
family history. Though it had been almost three years since they last 
saw each other, Takami could tell that this was not lost on his sister. 

His sister, Shizue Takami, better known by the alias &#145;Ryuko Hitsujiko&#146;. 
After all this time, Takami could still not believe that all this had 
been left to his sister. It seemed like so long ago when their father 
passed away, leaving behind all his assets and his business (the Takami 
Concern) to the elder child, the daughter, Shizue Takami. Now she had 
changed the name of the business from the Takami Concern to the 
Hitsujiko Corporation. Though Takami had been given a fair portion of 
his father&#146;s wealth (enough to live off and enrol in Tengoku Aijin 
School) he could not help the feeling of being short-changed. Compared 
to what Shizue had, Takami had nothing. Still, if he looked at this with 
his head instead of his heart, he would have realized that his father 
made the right choice. Takami was in no way cut out to run a business. 
He was still a student after all, and what&#146;s more, he was a fighter. The 
blood of fighting ran through his veins, faster and stronger than any 
river. There was no way he could cross himself by putting is urge to 
fight aside. Shizue was very much the opposite to Takami. Where he was 
hot headed and vengeful, she was cool, calm and careful. Like a wild cat 
stalking a wilder beast, Shizue planned for the attack with skill and 
cunning. This made her the ultimate choice to succeed her father as CEO 
of the company. 

Takami strode through the double glass revolving doors, into the 
polished, decorated and spacious innards of the Hitsujiko building. As 
he walked slowly to the front desk, eyeballing his sister&#146;s HQ, a couple 
of the security guards took attention to the curious boy. The burly men 
wasted no time debating his presence, and marched up to Takami, cutting 
him off before he reached the front desk. 

&#147;Hey, kid!&#148;

Takami stopped walking as he saw the two security guards standing around 
him. The former leader of the Tengoku Dream Rebels pulled his hand out 
of his pockets and clenched his fists in reflex. &#147;You have some sort of 
problem with me?&#148; Takami asked. 

The second guard piped up. &#147;What the hell do you think this is, a 
playground or something? Beat it, kid, before I throw you out with my 
own two hands.&#148;

Takami crossed his arms. &#147;What makes you think I have no business here?&#148;

&#147;I dunno, the fact that you&#146;re a child?&#148; The second guard said 
sarcastically. 

&#147;I&#146;m here to see my sister.&#148; Takami said with a sigh. &#147;My name is Kozue 
Takami. I&#146;m sure she&#146;s told you all about me. But if she hasn&#146;t well&#133; I 
think you better go ask her.&#148;

While one of the guards froze up in shock (realizing that he had just 
yelled at the boss&#146;s brother) the other showed his disbelief in the form 
of relaxed chuckle. 

&#147;Oh yeah right!&#148; He said mockingly. &#147;You expect me to believe that 
you&#146;re the boss&#146;s-&#147;

The second guard cut off the first, and whispered into his ear, while 
Takami remained silent through the altercation. Whatever was said seemed 
to calm the first security guard down, because he backed of in an 
instant. With regretful eyes, he waved his hands in defence. 

&#147;Uh&#133;&#148; The guard began fragilely. &#147;... I&#146;m sorry about the 
misunderstanding, Mr. Takami. I had no idea&#133; you see, Miss Hitsujiko 
doesn&#146;t speak much of you and I had no idea that... well...&#148; 

Takami unwound his arms &#147;Forget about it. I didn&#146;t exactly prepare for a 
red carpet welcome anyway. Just tell her that I&#146;ve arrived.&#148;

&#147;Can do, sir.&#148; The second security guard said. 

However, there was a strange twinkle in Takami&#146;s eyes as he added, 
&#147;Oh... just one more thing...&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148;

A vicious hand snaked out from nowhere and latched onto the first 
guard&#146;s neck. The second stood back in fear as Takami clutched down on 
the taller man, his fingernail gripping deeply into toned flesh. The 
guard wheezed and gasped from breath, as Takami&#146;s vice-like grip held 
his neck with steadfast potency. Takami smiled innocently at the man, 
taking great joy in choking the bigger man.

&#147;Don&#146;t call me a kid.&#148; Takami said, staring into the older guy&#146;s eyes. 
&#147;If you call me a kid again, I&#146;ll snap your jaw in two and make myself a 
necklace from your teeth.&#148;

Takami gave one final push and chucked the security guard to the ground. 
The man coughed and dragged in as much breath as he could, his cheeks 
turning a slightly pale blue. But while the guard writhed along the 
ground, Takami looked back at the second, now frightened security guard.

&#147;Take me to my sister.&#148; He said calmly. 

**********

Deep below the Hitsujiko Corp&#146;s main building, sixty metres below the 
busy streets of the Shibuya district, there was a huge underground 
laboratory complex. Dozens of eager scientists, all donning the 
trademark white coats and the badge symbol of company, the Kanji for 
&#145;fire&#146;, scurried through the halls of the lab, darting in and out of the 
white rooms and sub-laboratories. Though this area was fairly new in 
creation (built in 1993) from all the experiments taking place, you 
would have believed that it had been in business since the sixties. The 
huge multi-level laboratory was known as the Hitsujiko Research 
Department. 

In the lowest level of the HRD, in the largest testing room of the 
entire complex, stood two figures, marvelling at the most recent 
experiment to have taken place. One of them, was a young scientist, in 
his early twenties, known to the few as Dr. Tetsuya Shigeyuki. Though he 
had a brilliant and dark future ahead of him, he was not the most 
strident of the two onlookers. The second person, standing with a 
contemptuous smile pasted over her lips, was the woman known as Shizue 
Takami, or, better known to the masses as Ryuko Hitsujiko. The CEO of 
the Hitsujiko Corp and the leader of the vile gang of Tokyo Central, the 
Hotsuma Boys.

Shizue laughed, pulling a stray lock of her long black hair behind her 
ear. She had been waiting so long for this moment, and now it was 
finally here. 

&#147;Doctor&#133;&#148; She began. &#147;You called me here so I could be briefed on your 
progress?&#148;

Dr. Shigeyuki smiled back. &#147;That&#146;s quite right. If you&#146;ll just hazard a 
look in front of you... I can show you what I&#146;ve done so far...&#148;

Shizue looked over at the floor in front of them, as she had been asked 
to do, but saw nothing. She was about to question Dr. Shigeyuki about 
that, until he withdrew a remote control from the pocket of his white 
coat. He clicked on one of its few buttons, in the direction of the 
space, and instantly, things began to happen. The two bolts on the floor 
swung to one side, and the circular door shifted around, rising while 
doing so. Shizue gasped as a huge cylinder rose up from the ground, 
filled with a watery blue liquid. Mist poured from the glass cylinder 
like dry ice, and as it stopped moving, Shizue was given a clear view of 
what was inside the transparent tube. A human being. 

Dr. Shigeyuki smiled. &#147;Is it not magnificent?&#148;

&#147;My word&#133;&#148; Shizue gasped. &#147;Is that really&#133; Seiya?&#148;

&#147;I assure you it is. After three months of hibernation in the 
containment liquid, he has morphed into a whole new form! It took time, 
but I have finally managed to find a chemical which will allow his body 
to merge with the animal cells we refined all those years ago. It has 
made him into a stronger, faster, more capable soldier with which we can 
use to the benefit of the Hitsujiko Corporation! The muscle enhancements 
and brainwave control have also made him more subservient than our last 
test sample. Seiya Mochizuki is the perfect prototype for the AURA 
project!&#148;
 
Shizue could barely take in what Dr. Shigeyuki was saying. All she was 
aware of was Seiya. Seiya Mochizuki was the sub-leader of the Hotsuma 
Boys. When Shizue had told him of a secret test that would enhance 
strength, Seiya jumped at the chance. But now he looked completely 
different. His previous brown hair was now replaced with a sickly grey. 
His muscles had grown to such a state that his body looked like that of 
a 25-year-old, not a 17-year-old schoolboy. Even though he was asleep at 
the time so she couldn&#146;t be sure, Shizue knew full well that Seiya&#146;s 
eyes would be a different colour too. 

The prototype for the AURA Project had finally been created. If Shizue 
presented this body to the board members of the Eikuseiju Foundation, 
there was no way they could question her. It was perfect. 

&#147;How will he act when he awakens?&#148; Shizue asked. 

&#147;He will pledge his allegiance to anyone who he has been programmed to 
serve.&#148;

&#147;Programmed?&#148;

Dr. Shigeyuki nodded. &#147;Correct. As I have told you, I have been working 
with his brainwaves for some time. His mind has been woven in such a way 
that he regards everything in a way that a computer would, by evaluating 
the best needs of a situation and following it to the latter. It is a 
little process I have devised, and I like to call it, 
Psycho-Programming.&#148;

&#147;So...&#148; Shizue mused. &#147;He will see everything in black and white.&#148;

&#147;Yes! Finally I have created a bio-tool that is free of the taint of 
human emotion! He is nothing less than a ruthless killing machine! The 
Eikuseiju Foundation will have no choice but to entrust us with the 
brunt of the work for the AURA-Project.&#148;

Shizue smiled at her subordinate. &#147;You&#146;re very ambitious, Doctor. Most 
people would run in fear from the likes of Drake Azureas and Genzo 
Kakyoku... not to mention that oaf, Nifrid. What makes you think that 
they will allow you express entrance into their prized project?&#148;

&#147;Because they need my skills. And because I have developed the prototype 
for it, as they commanded you to do. As soon as I get my hands on that 
data from Genzo Kakyoku&#146;s genetic manipulation experiments... I will be 
able to make you an even greater weapon than Seiya...&#148;

&#147;Good.&#148; Said the woman. &#147;Because I&#146;m getting tired of going back to 
those idiots again and again every time I want to make a decision in my 
own company. I suppose it serves me right for joining the Eikuseiju 
Foundation.&#148;

&#147;You were right to do that. Their resources stretch across the entire 
world. Look at this boy. Normally, we would not have been able to use 
this boy for tests, because of the parents, but with the influence of 
the Eikuseiju Foundation... such trivial matters can be... swept away, 
like so much dirt.&#148;

&#147;I suppose. So how long will it take before Seiya is ready for active 
use?.&#148;
&#147;In four months. In just enough time for your plans for Tomeishuu High.&#148;

Shizue crossed her arms. &#147;You needn&#146;t concern yourself with that. The 
school is meaningless to me, I am only interested in one thing&#133; the one 
thing that school has to offer me... once I obtain it, I want you to 
restart the &#145;Psycho-Programming&#146; process.&#148;

&#147;You have something up your sleeve, eh?&#148;

&#147;Yes I do... once I secure the Tomeishuu sample and the &#145;demon&#146;, Tokyo 
as we know it, will be at my feet... in four months&#133; it will begin...&#148;

&#147;Have you named this... endeavour?&#148; Dr. Shigeyuki asked.

&#147;I have,&#148; Shizue replied. &#147;I call it&#133; Operation A.&#148;

Dr. Shigeyuki chuckled. &#147;I don&#146;t think I have ever met anyone like you.&#148;

&#147;I assume that you haven&#146;t!&#148; Shizue joked. &#147;My deviousness is my badge 
of distinction. They don&#146;t call me the Queen of Aces for nothing. In 
four months, with the help of Seiya and the Hotsuma Boys, I will extract 
the greatest possible soldier for my impending war with the Eikuseiju 
Foundation. The perfect sentinel to serve me.&#148;

Just as the two of them got talking, Shizue and Dr. Shigeyuki silenced 
themselves as a secretary, donning a usual set of glasses and a pin 
board, walked through the automatic doors and bowed before Shizue. 

Shizue sighed. &#147;What is the problem?&#148;

&#147;I am sorry to disturb you and Dr. Shigeyuki, Miss Hitsujiko, but a man 
claiming to be your brother has appeared up on ground level. I believe 
his name is Kozue Takami?&#148;

Shizue blinked hard. &#147;Kozue?! He is here? Blast it all! What does that 
street urchin want now?&#148;

&#147;Should I have him removed, miss?&#148; The secretary asked.

&#147;No. I shall speak with my brother now. Send him up to my office.&#148;
