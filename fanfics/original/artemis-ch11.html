<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 11 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/artemis-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Circe studied the woman who was sitting at the end of
the bar, feeling faintly curious about the odd vibe
that the lady threw off. She was certainly attractive
looking, with long red hair and a lovely body under
those dressy clothes, but she seemed more interested
in looking around for someone than in the company
nearby her.

She waved for another drink and Circe walked over, the
blonde dressed in a leather bodysuit. &quot;What can I get
you?&quot; she asked the newcomer curiously.

&quot;Rum and coke, easy on the rum,&quot; she answered, green
eyes narrowed slightly at the glint of the zippers
from Circe&#39;s clothes.

&quot;Of course,&quot; she answered as Circe poured the drink.
Handing it over Circe asked, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen
you around Miss...?&quot;

&quot;Margaret,&quot; she supplied quietly, &quot;and I&#39;ve heard
about the Daughters before, but this is the first time
I&#39;ve been here.&quot;

Without any effort Circe shifted her perceptions
slightly, sensing a faint sheen of magic about the
other woman. There was not enough energy there to
indicate that she was a magician, but it did show that
she was magically talented in some form. &quot;Nice to have
you,&quot; Circe smiled, &quot;but what brings you here now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure,&quot; Margaret conceded.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Circe blinked.

&quot;I&#39;m possessed of a mild ability to foresee the
future,&quot; Margaret said, &quot;and my vision told me that
I&#39;d meet someone that I&#39;m interested in here.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Circe asked. Seeing the other woman hesitate
she added, &quot;I might be able to help you find him or
her.&quot;

&quot;Her,&quot; Margaret blushed faintly, &quot;name is Athena.&quot; A
fond smile, &quot;I ran into her once over at the
Sisterhood bookstore, then down at the local community
center, but I don&#39;t seem to be able to make an
impression on her.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Circe did her best not to smile or laugh. &#39;Wait
till I tell Diana that her sister has acquired a
groupie,&#39; she mused. &quot;I think I know who you mean,&quot;
she said with a straight face, &quot;why don&#39;t I go find
her for you?&quot;

&quot;No, no!&quot; Margaret quickly held up a hand. She smiled
at her shyly, &quot;Do you think you could just point her
out for me?&quot;

This time Circe dud chuckle, but it was a good natured
amusement. &quot;I&#39;ll do that,&quot; she smiled. Asking Diana to
cover things Circe moved off into the crowds in the
bar, weaving between all of the young men and women.

Not surprisingly Athena was sitting at a back table,
engaged in a spirited debate with Jess Drake. &quot;But
magic doesn&#39;t have base structures,&quot; Jess argued,
black hair falling in her eyes, &quot;it is more of a
prayer to the powers underlying the universe.&quot;

&quot;But consider quantum theory,&quot; Athena pushed a bit of
her blonde hair back, &quot;and seemingly unrelated events
that are part of a greater order...&quot;

&quot;I hate to interrupt,&quot; Circe said with a grin, &quot;but I
need to borrow Athena a bit.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Jess smiled, drinking from a can of
cola.

&quot;Staying away from the booze,&quot; Circe noted, recalling
several apocalyptic drinking bouts from Jess recently.

&quot;Drowning my sorrows in booze just makes me feel worse
in the morning,&quot; Jess answered dryly, eyes narrowing a
bit.

&quot;Do me a favor and don&#39;t bring up the booze in front
of Jess,&quot; Athena whispered to Circe as they moved off,
&quot;a few of her friends are trying to keep her off the
drink while she recovers a bit.&quot;

&quot;And how did you get involved?&quot; Circe blinked, &quot;You
barely know Jess.&quot;

&quot;Diana, however, knows Jess pretty well and she asked
me to do this in her place,&quot; Athena explained wryly.
Raising an eyebrow she asked, &quot;Now, what exactly did
you want?&quot;

Fighting back a grin she sketched in the young woman
at the bar. &quot;Looks like you&#39;ve made quite a impression
on her,&quot; Circe smirked, &quot;so what are you going to do
about it?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Athena frowned as she said, &quot;I
remember her from the community center, but...&quot; Athena
took a moment to turn her formidable memory on various
casual meetings at the Sisterhood bookstore,
eventually matching up the woman she had met at the
community center to one of those conversations.

&quot;Do you remember her now?&quot; Circe asked, once again
feeling mildly in awe of the goddess&#39;s incredible
memory.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Athena nodded, &quot;but I thought our conversations
were just casual.&quot;

&quot;For a goddess of wisdom you can be remarkably stupid
about romance,&quot; Circe muttered.

&quot;Aphrodite can seduce anything on two legs,&quot; Athena
said dryly, &quot;I never really got that talent, thank
you.&quot;

&quot;So, do you want to talk to her,&quot; Circe asked, &quot;or
should I just tell her I couldn&#39;t find you?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Athena hesitated a moment then continued, &quot;I
guess I should at least talk to her, she did go to the
trouble of coming here looking for me.&quot;

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll tell her that you&#39;re here,&quot; Circe
chuckled, walking back over towards the bar.

Margaret looked up from her drink as Circe walked over
to her, the redhead looking visibly nervous. &quot;Did you
find her?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Circe grinned as she pointed towards the corner
where Athena was gradually making her way towards
them.

&quot;You told her I was asking about her?&quot; Margaret asked
resignedly.

&quot;Athena&#39;s a friend of mine,&quot; Circe reassured her, &quot;and
I promise she won&#39;t bite.&quot;



Meanwhile at another table two very different young
women were sitting down to eat their meal. Carmen
Henderson smiled at her companion, the redhead
reaching out to put a hand on her companion&#39;s arm as
she murmured, &quot;You have no idea how annoyed I was when
you just disappeared on me like that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Diana said, the beautiful werewolf
meeting her eyes gently, &quot;but I was terrified of
telling you the whole truth.&quot;

&quot;Considering I fainted dead away when we met your wolf
mother,&quot; Carmen admitted wryly, &quot;I suppose you had
reason to be afraid.&quot; A smile, &quot;I&#39;m glad you left your
name and number on your note, or I would have never
found you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just glad you came after me in the first place,&quot;
Diana murmured softly.

&quot;After our night together,&quot; a blush colored Carmen&#39;s
cheeks as she continued, &quot;finding you again was a
priority.&quot;

&quot;Something that I&#39;m looking forward to doing to you
again and again,&quot; Diana&#39;s voice dropped to a dangerous
purr.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Carmen squeezed her arm. She pulled back a
bit, clearing her throat as she looked around the
Daughters, &quot;How come I&#39;ve never heard of this club, I
wonder?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a exclusive club that serves a pretty exclusive
clientele,&quot; Diana explained, &quot;all of us who are
touched by the supernatural.&quot;

&quot;You mean that everyone here is...?&quot; Carmen looked
around with wide eyes.

&quot;That or their guests,&quot; Diana agreed, &quot;I&#39;ve met
vampires, fellow weres, succubi, demons and many
others.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Carmen blinked, suddenly looking a little lost.
She smiled, &quot;I thought I was in a minority being gay,
but this is odder.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that bad, but we&#39;re certainly in a
minority too,&quot; Diana admitted. Dropping her voice she
said, &quot;Even the club&#39;s owners are unique.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Carmen looked curious.

&quot;They&#39;ve been running this place for nearly twenty
years,&quot; Diana revealed quietly, &quot;and apparently they
haven&#39;t aged a day.&quot;

A grin as Carmen said, &quot;Wonder if I can get a bottle
of that?&quot;

Diana reached out to stroke her cheek, &quot;Trust me, you
don&#39;t need it.&quot;

To be continued...
