Shards of Fate

&quot;Is... is she going to be alright?&quot; Jenn asked nervously glancing down 
at her friend as Alyson placed the redhead gently onto her bed.

Alyson took another look at Kim&#39;s bandaged arm, and then sharply gazed 
up, &quot;Where did she get cut?&quot; She quickly demanded. 
                                             
&quot;The washroom...&quot; Jessica stated pointing down the hall, &quot;We still 
haven&#39;t cleaned it up so-&quot; She was startled by Alyson unexpectedly 
getting up and pushing past her in the direction she had just indicated. 
Nicole followed close behind the girl. Jessica took one last look at 
Jenn and Kim before venturing after the girls, leaving Kris standing in 
the doorway.

Kris tried to find her voice as she stood in the threshold, one hand on 
the doorframe. She observed as Jenn slowly sat upon the bed next to Kim 
and gingerly brushed the redhead&#39;s hair out off her face. Kris felt her 
heart ache at the mere sight, however she could not take her eyes off 
the two of them. Jenn finally looked up from Kim to see her old friend 
watching her. She glared at the girl. 

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Jenn demanded coldly. 

&quot;I...&quot; Kris struggled with the word inside her head. There was so much 
she wanted to say, but didn&#39;t know how to convey them, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; 
She guiltily said, lowering her head to avoid Jenn&#39;s gaze. 

&quot;You&#39;re sorry?&quot; Jenn asked the anger she had for the girl could be heard 
clearly, &quot;You lied to me!&quot; She exclaimed. 

&quot;I...&quot; Kris tried to look at her friend, but found it hard.

&quot;You knew all this time and didn&#39;t even tell me.&quot; Jenn vexed, &quot;Where you 
going to just pretend that May didn&#39;t exist or something?&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Kris countered, &quot;I just...&quot; she thought to herself for a moment, 
&quot;I just...&quot; She was no longer sure why it was that she lied. She 
clenched at the chest of her shirt with a trembling hand, &quot;I...&quot; Her 
eyes lowered to the ground.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk to you right now.&quot; Jenn said bluntly and turned 
back to Kim&#39;s sleeping face. 

&quot;But...&quot; Kris started to enter the room with one hand out reached 
towards Jenn. 

&quot;LEAVE!!&quot; Jenn shouted, startling Kris so badly that she staggered 
backwards out of the room to lean again the far wall of the hall, &quot;I... 
sorry...&quot; She slowly righted herself, pulled the door shut before 
heading back downstairs.

In the washroom, Alyson set her sword next to the door before she hoped 
through the mess of glass. She watched her step carefully, making sure 
not to stir up any of the broken mirror or blood. She knelt low to the 
ground and peered closely at some of the splatters of crimson, then 
glanced up at the line of broken mirrors.

&quot;Did she do this all on her own?&quot; Alyson inquired quietly, almost as if 
she was afraid of waking someone, &quot;Was anyone else in the room?&quot; 

&quot;Not as far as we know.&quot; Jessica stated leaning against one of the 
stalls with her arms crossed, &quot;As far as I know she came in here alone. 
Something must have really frightened her because she was shaking 
something fierce and rambling to herself.&quot;

Alyson stood up and approached one of the mirrors, &quot;What did she say?&quot; 
She continued to probe while examining the edge of the glass. 

&quot;Just that she saw May in the mirror.&quot; Jessica replied, &quot;Maybe she 
really did see a ghost.&quot; She said with a shrug. 

&quot;But how did she know it was May?&quot; Alyson asked, one eyebrow rose, while 
looking over at the dorm head, &quot;She just arrived here, didn&#39;t she?&quot; 

Jessica was startled by this question. She never considered that before, 
&quot;But Jenn believed her and said she saw May the other day.&quot; 

&quot;Maybe she did.&quot; Alyson returned to the mirror&#39;s frame and stopped. She 
abruptly turned around and surveyed the scene before her and then turned 
back again and gazed into the sinks. There was not a single shard of 
glass in any of them, &quot;Did you clean the counter already?&quot; She asked 
with a note of concern. 

&quot;No, why?&quot; Jessica stepped around Nicole, who was standing near the 
door, carefully removing the daggers from the apples. Jessica patted the 
girl on the head before approaching the sinks herself and tried to find 
what was interesting Alyson so much. 

&quot;When a mirror breaks,&quot; Alyson explained pointing at the frame of one of 
the mirrors, &quot;Most of the shards would have just toppled and come 
crashing down on the sink.&quot; She turned around and studied the glass of 
the floor; &quot;This looks more like the mirrors exploded outwards at the 
girl.&quot;  

&quot;Are you saying the mirrors attacked Kim?&quot; Jessica asked with a chuckle, 
&quot;No matter how much people think this place is haunted, it isn&#39;t.&quot; She 
stated confident with her beliefs, &quot;I&#39;ve been here most of my life and 
not once have I seen a ghost.&quot; 

Alyson knelt close to the ground to examine the blood trail, &quot;I never 
said it was a ghost.&quot; Alyson stated. 

Jessica merely shook her head, &quot;Well, you continue to play detective. I 
need to check the office to see if there were any calls while we were 
gone.&quot; She began to leave the room and turned to Nicole before leaving, 
&quot;Make sure Nancy Drew here doesn&#39;t get herself into to much trouble for 
me, alright?&quot; She said with a smile. 

&quot;Sure!&quot; Nicole said cheerfully. 

&quot;Just stay away from that glass.&quot; Jessica added. She took one last look 
at the room. She may not believe in ghosts or spirits but something 
about that glass made her shudder. She quickly turned away and left the 
room.

&quot;Can I help?&quot; Nicole asked excitedly as she wiped one of the daggers off 
with a paper towel and placed it in her pocket and the apples on the 
counter.

&quot;Unnn...&quot; Alyson was too lost in her thoughts to notice the girl. She 
was starring at a large piece of glass that was so thoroughly soaked 
that it turned flush. She leaned closer to the shard and blinked and 
then glanced at yet another and another, &quot;Nicole, come here!&quot; She called 
out to the girl. 

&quot;&#39;Kay!&quot; Nicole carefully crept across the room, avoiding the glass the 
best she could and knelt next to Alyson, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Look at the glass and tell me what you see?&quot; Alyson asked politely. 

Nicole didn&#39;t understand, however she did as she asked and stared upon 
the shards of glass. Millions of multiple images of herself stared back 
up at her, &quot;I see... mirrors...&quot; She stated bewildered as to what it was 
the girl wanted her to see.

&quot;Look over here.&quot; Alyson pointed at an area of glass covered in blood. 

Nicole, yet again, did as she was asked, she expected to see the same 
things, however, &quot;Where am I?&quot; She asked even more confused. Several 
shards of glass in that area didn&#39;t show any reflection of the girls. 
One could see the reflection of the walls and the ceiling, but nothing 
of themselves. Almost like the fabled Vampire with no reflection. Nicole 
glanced at another shard and there she was staring back at herself, 
&quot;What?&quot; She queried.

Alyson looked back up at the middle mirror frame, a single shard still 
held firmly to it. She stood up to take a closer look only to find that 
this fragment too held no reflection, &quot;We need to find Natalie.&quot; She 
said urgently, as she backed away from the glass, &quot;Quickly.&quot;
