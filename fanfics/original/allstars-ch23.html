6:29 am

 

Nobody really knew why Leena had summoned the team to meet at the field 
at 6:30 in the morning, when they should have been sleeping, not even 
Freya. The match was only a few hours away, and some of the girls were 
still a little tired from their last-minute exercises yesterday, but 
Leena made sure to impress upon them the urgency of this meeting. She 
promised they would have plenty of time to rest later- they just had to 
attend for a few minutes. Fifteen sleepy pairs of eyes stared drearily 
at each other, and at their Coach, who- despite her sudden request- 
looked especially lovely in the morning mist.

&quot;Hello, ladies,&quot; she said. &quot;This won&#39;t take long. I just wanted to start 
a little tradition for us. On the morning of every game, whether we&#39;re 
here or at another campus, I want us to meet together on the field and 
take a moment of silence. But before that, please take your shoes and 
socks off, and gather together in a circle.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not going to hold hands and sing songs, are we?&quot; Kasumi grumbled.

&quot;No. This is a moment of solemn reflection. Take your shoes off, 
please.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Coach,&quot; she sighed. Sixteen pairs of bare feet, including Leena&#39;s, 
circled around on the dewy grass, and they waited for their coach to 
explain herself. After a few moments of silence, though, they began to 
realize how quieting and peaceful this was, and many of their fears and 
anxieties left them as they absorbed the morning tranquility.

&quot;Today we are gathered here as a team,&quot; Leena began. &quot;We are going to 
prove ourselves worthy of victory and worthy of recognition. Today we 
are standing on holy ground, ladies. Upon this field, and the many 
fields that are just like it, people such as yourselves have battled one 
another for glory, honor, and respect. Many of them were as nervous as 
you are. Many of them have passed through the fires and distinguished 
themselves as valiant warriors. Their struggles have been impressed in 
the soil; their blood, tears, and sweat have consecrated this ground for 
us. May we honor them with our strength, and may their spirits be with 
us today.&quot;

She dismissed them after about five more minutes of silence.

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;Game On!&quot;

 

When the team reached the door that would lead them to the field, Leena 
advised them to take a deep breath, relax, and just do the best they 
could. As overused as her line of thought was, it was really the only 
thing she could say to assure her team and give them strength. Her part 
in this was over for now: it would be up to them to win now.

&quot;Here goes,&quot; Freya whispered as she pushed the door open, leading her 
team onto the field. It was a wonderful day for a game. The sky was as 
clear as glass, bold and beautiful blue like a vast curtain overhead, 
and the sun shined bright, but not too strong. The wind was gentle and 
calm, the grass smelled sweet and ripe, and the surge of adrenaline took 
over to wash all fears and anxieties away. The only problem was that 
very few people were there to witness this match. Carnegie&#39;s new soccer 
field had bleachers that could seat a thousand comfortably, but there 
was barely a fraction of that number in attendance, and they were mostly 
family, friends, and curious onlookers with nothing better to do.

&quot;Turnout&#39;s a little lower than I was hoping,&quot; Freya murmured.

&quot;Well, what can you expect?&quot; Fausta grumbled. &quot;We&#39;re a small school with 
a brand-new sports team that owes its reputation to novelty. And it&#39;s a 
practice game.&quot;

&quot;I know, but I really thought our efforts would bear more fruit.&quot;

&quot;At least the crew from Lily and Parody made it,&quot; Felicity said, 
noticing Gardenia, Robin, and Odessa sitting with a few of their 
employees. &quot;I see Ms. Rosewood and the Chairman, too, and Mr. Warren as 
well. That&#39;s an unusual combination.&quot;

&quot;The Chairman&#39;s probably here to see how his rival&#39;s pet project is 
moving along,&quot; Fleur said. Carnegie and Laudendale met in the center of 
the field and began doing warm-ups; in the meantime, the girls kept 
chattering and the staffs set everything up.

&quot;I don&#39;t see my family anywhere,&quot; Elisa murmured as she peered through 
the crowd. &quot;Oh! There&#39;s Rain! She certainly is a bundle of energy!&quot; 
Elisa smiled sweetly at Alice, who was trying to wave and stretch at the 
same time. Felicity&#39;s father had made it as well, but she was trying 
hard to ignore him: she didn&#39;t want to be distracted by his meticulous 
stare.

&quot;Yo, there&#39;s your boyfriend, Shan,&quot; Lauren pointed. Shannon turned 
around and saw Scott waving at her. She saluted him but cast a sour 
expression towards the substitute goalie.

&quot;He ain&#39;t my boyfriend. We&#39;re just close, is all.&quot;

&quot;Right, and Fausta&#39;s St. Francis Xavier.&quot;

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t knock him! That guy was one ballsy bastahd!&quot;

&quot;Whatever. Damn, he&#39;s hot! Must be nice having a &#39;best friend&#39; like 
that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, shut up.&quot;

&quot;Catholics,&quot; Fleur muttered, rolling her eyes. Nadia suddenly jumped up 
and waved at somebody: apparently her Nana had made it after all, and 
she even brought a new toy with her.

&quot;Good Lord, woman!&quot; Jen exclaimed. &quot;Does your grandmother have a new 
lover every week?&quot;

&quot;Might be the same one. Nana says she iz having big heart. I say being 
heartbreaker iz not attractive.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re almost ready to start,&quot; Kasumi said, glancing at the Coach&#39;s box. 
She had scanned the bleachers for her father, but was disappointed. He 
had called to say he &quot;probably&quot; wouldn&#39;t be able to make it, but swore 
on his life he&#39;d be there next time. Valencia saw the grim look on her 
face and wanted to help ease her mind, but Leena was calling them over. 
The announcer introduced himself and the two teams while she was 
imparting some last-minute advice.

&quot;Welcome, ladies, gentlemen, and all sports fans, to an event which 
promises to be one for the books. It&#39;s a gorgeous Saturday afternoon 
today, perfect weather for a soccer game between two fresh faces in the 
sports world. Today&#39;s their very first time playing a game, so it&#39;ll be 
interesting to see how two rookie teams do under the pressure. The 
visiting team today is Laudendale University, led by Coach Fredericka 
Wilstone, no stranger to the sport as she&#39;s carried several little 
league teams to state championships. The team hosting this game is 
Carnegie University, led by Coach Leena Parkin-Katajisto, a veteran of 
the high school tournaments. This may be a practice game, but you can 
bet that both teams will be giving everything they&#39;ve got to prove 
themselves. And...it looks like they&#39;re ready to begin. Folks, if you&#39;ll 
take a look at your programs, you&#39;ll get a rundown of today&#39;s lineup, so 
I hope you&#39;ll be able to keep up once I get going.&quot;

Since this was only a practice game, there was no need to play the 
national anthem. The air was tense as the ladies parted from their 
coaches, took their positions, and waited for the referee to begin the 
game. Kasumi stared at her rival striker, who was wearing a frown of 
anxiety. There was something calming in knowing that her opponent was 
just as nervous as she was.

&quot;Hey, good luck today,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Thanks, you too.&quot; In that moment the two women somehow became 
friends...and then the whistle blew, the ball was thrown, and the game 
began.

 

- Alice Hawthorne, 140 lbs (63.6 kg), American, right midfielder/reserve

 

Kasumi bolted out of the blue and swept past the other striker, 
dribbling down the field to the midfielders, where she handed the ball 
to Felicity. Fleur and Elisa closed in to support them; Felicity moved 
around the left midfielder but got blocked by the defensive, so she 
tapped the ball back to Kasumi. She bounced it off her chest and 
attempted to score, but the goalie caught it and threw it back. 
Laudendale&#39;s stopper and sweeper passed it between them as they ran 
through on the way to their forward, but Elisa and Fleur cornered them, 
taking the ball into their possession and handing it back to Felicity, 
who made a wild shot. The goalie took it again and threw it far, so that 
her striker and forward could take it and make an attempt of their own. 
Nadia quickly sniped the ball away and saw where she could have a clear 
shot, but meekly kicked the ball to Fleur, who was quickly surrounded. 
Without thinking, she launched the ball to Elisa, who was suddenly 
stricken with fright.

&quot;Oh dear, oh dear, oh...shit!&quot; she squealed, too panicked to keep her 
ladylike composure. She hyperventilated as a rush of adrenaline washed 
over her and sent her flying down the field like a mad gazelle. &quot;Don&#39;t 
panic, don&#39;t panic, don&#39;t panic!&quot; she kept on praying. &quot;Just go, 
go-go-go! Go for it, go for it, go for it, go for it!&quot;

&quot;You idiot, don&#39;t try to score by yourself!&quot; Fausta hissed. &quot;No! Give 
the ball to...oh, for crying out loud! You stupid...&quot; She started 
cursing in her native language as Elisa, overflowing with terror and 
energy, kicked hard and sent the ball hurtling straight for the goal. 
The keeper caught it easily and, with the left midfielder out of 
position, Carnegie&#39;s defensive net now had a hole. The Laudendale 
striker and forward exploited this weakness and sprinted all the way to 
the goal, making their first serious attempt to score. Thankfully, 
Lauren stopped it and handed the ball to Shannon.

&quot;Good catch,&quot; she sighed. That last offensive had taken her by surprise. 
Fausta covered her face and rebuked her friend.

&quot;Don&#39;t ever try that again,&quot; she scowled. &quot;Next time you get the ball, 
just give it to me or Nadia!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; Elisa wheezed, pale and drenched in sweat. &quot;Something 
just took over me and I lost control!&quot;

&quot;Then exercise some restraint!&quot;

&quot;Get off girlfriend&#39;s back, bitch!&quot; Nadia growled. Leena groaned and 
shook her head, hoping her team wouldn&#39;t start arguing now, of all 
times. Luckily, the referee didn&#39;t have to call them out, and they 
behaved themselves long enough to intercept another attack.

&quot;Well, folks, Carnegie&#39;s off to a great start this afternoon. They&#39;re 
already made three offensive maneuvers, one right after the other, but 
Laudendale&#39;s defenses have held. You have to admire the spirit of that 
left midfielder, though, running the gauntlet without any support. 
Carnegie&#39;s defensive midfielder has the ball now after a clean 
interception...she&#39;s making it to the center with Laudendale right at 
her heels...passes to the right midfielder...she makes a run for the 
other side...gives it to the striker...striker gives it to the forward 
and makes a run for the goal...forward shoots and misses, but it&#39;s a 
free ball...oh! The striker just made a clean shot! It&#39;s the first goal 
of the game in Carnegie&#39;s favor!&quot;

&quot;Good shot, Kasumiiiii!!&quot; Valencia cried.

&quot;You rule, uh...girl with Japanese name!&quot; Rain shouted. &quot;Sorry I don&#39;t 
know your names yet! Hey Coach, send out Hot Lips Hawthorne!&quot; The game 
quickly resumed as the scattered applause died down, with Laudendale 
taking a lead. They got past Nadia and Jen with some quick passes and 
fast running- two weaknesses Carnegie was still struggling with- and got 
through Amy and Terra, who fought bravely to keep the ball on their 
side. But then there was Fausta, who wasn&#39;t going to let them get 
through her again. She plowed right into their formation, stole the 
ball, and launched it at Shannon, who made a mad dash for the goal.

&quot;Is that crazy bitch going to score?&quot; Lauren wondered. It looked like 
she was going to try: Kasumi and Felicity stayed with her as she made 
her way into Laudendale territory. The crowd started to clap, and one 
devoted young man decided to add his own support.

&quot;GIVE EM&#39; HELL, SHANNON THE CANNON!!!&quot; Shannon bounced the ball to 
Felicity, who faked the goalie out and returned the ball to Threal. A 
single flick of her ankle set the score at 2-0.

&quot;What an astonishing play! Carnegie jumps into the lead with another 
goal! Lauderdale has to be feeling the pressure now! They&#39;re moving in 
deep and they&#39;re not letting up. Playtime is over for these brave 
newcomers: now it&#39;s their turn to prove themselves. They&#39;re going past 
the midfielders and the defensive lineup...they&#39;re playing very hard, 
very close to the chest...I don&#39;t see anything reckless now. Their 
offense is a little lacking, but I&#39;ve noticed Carnegie&#39;s defense is at 
the same level, so it&#39;ll be interesting to see what gives...oh! A great 
shot, but they missed- NO! The shot rebounded and they made a second 
attempt! Carnegie&#39;s goalie is being assaulted from all angles. It&#39;s a 
miracle she was able to recover and guard the net after that last 
attack! Now their sweeper has the ball and is trying for a center field 
pass, but Laudendale&#39;s morale has been lifted after that last attack, 
and you know they&#39;ll try something like that again. With just five 
minutes left in the first half, it&#39;s still anybody&#39;s game.&quot;

&quot;Crap, that took a lot out of me!&quot; Lauren gasped. She resisted the 
strong urge to bend over and lean on her knees- Laudendale certainly 
needed no further encouragement. &quot;Yo, ladies, why didn&#39;t you stop them? 
I thought you all were more aggressive than that.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re bound to get through eventually,&quot; Shannon answered. &quot;It ain&#39;t 
like we haven&#39;t been tryin&#39; or nothin&#39;. Oh- watch out! SHIT!!&quot; Shannon 
dove but missed another offensive, but luckily, Fausta and Amy were 
there to watch her back, and recovered the ball for Carnegie. Amy kicked 
the ball back to Fleur, but she was tackled and lost balance as 
Laudendale took the ball back. Lacroix tried to stand, but winced in 
pain: she had twisted her ankle.

&quot;I told her,&quot; Arina sighed. She faced Freya and added, &quot;Now you know 
that pride comes before th- &quot;

&quot;Shake it off, Fleur! Come on, Terra, you&#39;ll have to do better than that 
if you want to work for me! Heads up, Lauren!&quot;

&quot;...Never mind,&quot; she muttered. The girl who knocked Fleur over broke off 
from her team and went over to help her up.

&quot;Oh my gosh, are you all right? I didn&#39;t mean to be so rough! Can you 
stand?&quot;

&quot;Piss off!&quot; she snapped, hopping back to her position. &quot;And watch where 
you&#39;re going next time!&quot;

&quot;Sheesh, I was only trying to help you,&quot; she griped. She turned to Jen 
and said, &quot;What&#39;s her problem?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t sweat it,&quot; she smiled; &quot;she&#39;s always like that.&quot; Meanwhile, as 
the final seconds counted down, Terra scrambled for the ball with Fausta 
at her side, but it was too late. With Lauren weary from her last two 
dramatic saves, Laudendale had an easy goal. The score ran up 2-1 right 
before halftime.

&quot;And there you have it, folks: a scrapper&#39;s heart and determination! It 
seems as if pummeling the goalie with shot after shot was the perfect 
strategy for Laudendale, and it looks like Carnegie&#39;s right midfielder 
has been injured. Coach Parkin-Katajisto will probably take this time to 
call up her reserves, but will it be enough? Stay seated for the second 
half, ladies and gentlemen, as these two bold beginners show us what 
they&#39;re made of!&quot;

 

- Shannon Threal, 138 lbs (62.7 kg), American, stopper-

 

&quot;Don&#39;t say a word,&quot; Fleur snarled as she hopped to the player&#39;s box, 
aiming her glare at Arina. She laid down and elevated her leg for the 
doctor to look at, but didn&#39;t seem to be in much pain.

&quot;I was just going to ask how you&#39;re holding up.&quot;

&quot;How do you think I&#39;m holding up, fool? Now I&#39;ll be out for the rest of 
the game- and maybe the next one, too.&quot;

&quot;Just take it easy,&quot; Leena advised her. &quot;This sort of thing happens all 
the time; we just have to cope with it. You&#39;re all doing well; I&#39;m proud 
we&#39;ve gotten so far. I&#39;m a little disappointed that you started that 
argument, but you seem to have gotten through it and focused on what&#39;s 
more important. Just keep up the good work and we&#39;ll make it through.&quot;

&quot;What about Fleur, ma&#39;am?&quot; Freya said. &quot;She&#39;s not in any condition to 
play.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not as bad as all that,&quot; she grumbled carelessly. &quot;Believe me, 
I&#39;ve had worse and walked away from them.&quot;

&quot;Still, Freya&#39;s right. Hawthorne, you&#39;re taking over. Don&#39;t make me 
regret it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ready, coach,&quot; she replied strongly. &quot;I&#39;ve been working very hard. 
I swear I won&#39;t let you down.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I wanted to hear. What about you, Ofdensen? Think you can 
go another round?&quot;

&quot;Short answer, no,&quot; she muttered, gulping down water and drying her 
face. &quot;Long answer, hell no.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate your honesty. Durante, you&#39;re taking over. Are you ready?&quot;

&quot;Does it matter if I&#39;m not?&quot; she answered nervously. She looked to 
Kasumi for strength, but Beckett was performing stretches, trying to 
keep herself limber. Instead, help came to her from an unexpected 
source.

&quot;Y-you&#39;ll d-do fine,&quot; Amy said, placing a warm hand on her shoulder. &quot;If 
I c-can last th-th-this long, anyb-body can.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re an accomplished athlete.&quot;

&quot;D-don&#39;t be l-l-like that. J-just rem-member w-what the Coach s-s-said 
earlier. C-come on, I&#39;ll b-bet you&#39;re g-g-great.&quot; Valencia couldn&#39;t help 
but glow at Amy&#39;s confidence in her abilities, and psyched herself up 
for her moment of truth. The worst part was waiting for the second half 
to begin, but at least they had someone to entertain them.

&quot;All right, it&#39;s about time the cavalry arrived! Woo-hoo! Hot Lips 
Hawthorne to the rescue! Show these Lauderdale lame-brains what a giant 
babe can do! I LOVE YOU, ALIIIIIIICE!! Woo!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s crazy,&quot; Arina giggled.

&quot;Ya got that right,&quot; Fleur muttered. Meanwhile, in the stands, Chairman 
Fitzgerald was starting to wish he could disappear. How could his best 
pupil humiliate him like that?!

&quot;Well, she&#39;s certainly getting into the spirit!&quot; Warren grinned. &quot;Maybe 
you have some redeeming qualities after all, old man!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t speak,&quot; he barked. &quot;I&#39;m embarrassed enough as it is.&quot;

&quot;I think the young lady is quite charming!&quot; Rosewood chirped. Fitzgerald 
glared at her, too, while Warren laughed. As the second half began, 
Samuel Velur sat up straight in his seat, making himself look more 
prominent, and glared at his daughter. Felicity had been making one 
mistake after another throughout the first half, and he would make sure 
she would remember what was at stake for the second. Felicity caught a 
glimpse of her father&#39;s profile before heading out into the field, and 
felt her stomach sinking. She could only try to drown out her 
frustration and anguish as she focused everything she had into the game.

What more does he want? I&#39;m doing the best I can! I just hope he doesn&#39;t 
throw a tantrum and yell at the Coach. No matter what I do, it&#39;s never 
going to be enough for him, is it? All my awards, all the victories, all 
of the sacrifices... I lost all of my old friends because he kept 
pushing me and pushing me...and now I can&#39;t even get close to these 
people, all because of him!

Nadia, I&#39;m so sorry. Please forgive me for ignoring you!

She wiped her eyes as Elisa gave her control of the ball. She wouldn&#39;t 
fail now...

 

- Arina Essylt, unknown weight (average), French, team 
psychologist/reserve-

 

&quot;Well, folks, if the first half of the game belonged to Carnegie, this 
one is all about Laudendale! They haven&#39;t let up once since the whistle 
blew, as so far they&#39;ve made an impressive five runs for the goal and 
have defended their territory on three separate occasions. Their keeper 
seems to be at peak performance, and they&#39;ve learned from the mistakes 
they made in the first half. I&#39;m not about to dismiss Carnegie, but if 
they don&#39;t pull together and show us something impressive, I&#39;m afraid I 
might have to! Carnegie&#39;s forward has the ball now...we&#39;ve seen some 
pretty decent plays from her so far, but- uh, no, wait, it looks like 
she&#39;s making a run for it! Holy cow, that woman&#39;s on fire! Straight 
through Laudendale&#39;s defense and...wow! Another goal for Carnegie! 
Folks, I don&#39;t know what to tell you! A seemingly mediocre forward has 
just pulled her team out from the depths and gave them a serious lead 
over their rivals- and it was almost too fast for me to call! That&#39;s one 
for the professionals to keep their eyes on!&quot;

&quot;And about time, too,&quot; Samuel Velur muttered.

&quot;Feleezity kitties rock hard!!&quot; Nadia screamed.

&quot;Yeah, not too shabby,&quot; Shannon smiled, giving a thumbs-up. &quot;This game&#39;s 
in the bag now!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t let your guard down!&quot; Terra shouted, taking an aggressive stance. 
&quot;They can still beat us, you know! We have plenty of time to lose!&quot; 
Fausta looked over at her coworker and smiled proudly at her devotional 
outburst. Apparently, there was more to meek little Terra than a cute 
face and an awkward personality. Carnegie took this boost in morale to 
launch an offensive, but it&#39;s dangerous to attack a wounded animal, 
especially if they&#39;re cornered, and with Laudendale down by two points, 
with only twenty minutes left in the game, there were bound to be 
surprises.

Felicity was on a roll, and turned from a depressing hermit into a 
lethal weapon, driving hard down the center to score again. But 
Laudendale was ready for her this time, and sent a right midfielder to 
steal the ball. She kicked hard, but her shot was blocked and turned 
around on her. Hawthorne flew in to recover it (Rain suddenly bursting 
with excitement), but Laudendale had excellent passing and lobbed it 
between their players, confusing her. They shot deep into Carnegie 
territory, held off Amy and Shannon, and fought a surprisingly tenacious 
Terra for a few rounds before offering a lame shot. Valencia caught it 
without any problems, but that only caused Laudendale to double their 
efforts, and they began relentlessly hounding the inner defense. Amy 
really showed her quality as she defended her position, and even held 
the ball for a moment as Shannon came in to claim it. But Laudendale was 
persistent, and captured the ball while it was sailing in midair. 
Valencia caught the next shot, but missed the second, which sent the 
score up 3-2.

&quot;I told you!&quot; Terra exclaimed. &quot;Don&#39;t let up yet! We can relax once the 
game&#39;s over!&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Valencia murmured, flushed with guilt. Shannon just waved at 
her.

&quot;Aw, nothin&#39; to be sorry about. Ya doin&#39; fine.&quot;

And I&#39;ll do better next time, she swore. But in the meantime, her team 
held tight onto their lead, and battled Laudendale fiercely as the 
minutes ticked away and the fate of the game remained unclear.

 

&quot;Five minutes left in the game. Carnegie&#39;s up three to two. Laudendale&#39;s 
played an excellent game so far, and if they can manage to get past 
Carnegie&#39;s defenses, they might be able to pull a victory out of this. 
Carnegie&#39;s goalie looks tired, but their coach appears confident- she&#39;s 
not sending in another substitute. Laudendale&#39;s offense isn&#39;t on par 
with Carnegie&#39;s, but if they can get one more goal and keep those 
penalty kicks coming, they&#39;ll emerge the winner. Carnegie has to play a 
defensive game and hold onto their lead if they want to win. 
Laudendale&#39;s driving through...they&#39;re going for it...they&#39;re going for 
it...! No! Their stopper interfered and is taking the ball back to 
center. She&#39;s...is she going for the goal? The stopper&#39;s going 
strong...passes to the midfielder...she&#39;s going for the sweeper...she&#39;s 
holding it...going for the goal...she kicks...it&#39;s not good, but there&#39;s 
no time left for a countermeasure! Laudendale makes a desperate attempt, 
but it&#39;s too little, too late! Carnegie wins three to two!&quot;

The applause and the cheers were fairly upbeat considering the number of 
spectators, but the joy on the field was much greater. Nearly everyone 
was jumping, cheering, waving, hugging, and dancing, and they had 
deserved it: they all fought hard to earn their first victory as a team. 
But considering how excellently Lauderdale played, it only seemed fair 
to go over to their side of the field and congratulate them. Kasumi 
sought out the other team&#39;s striker, smiled at her, and reached her hand 
out.

&quot;That was a great game! You were really awesome!&quot;

&quot;You weren&#39;t so bad yourself,&quot; she chuckled. They shook hands and she 
said, &quot;I&#39;m Stephanie.&quot;

&quot;Kasumi.&quot;

&quot;Good to meet you.&quot; Stephanie laughed and hugged her, flustering the 
dear girl. Lauren grinned as she saw what they were doing and figured 
she wanted in on some &quot;hug action&quot; as well.

&quot;You, I&#39;m gonna say hello to that goalie of theirs!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not gay, you know,&quot; Fausta said, pointing to the woman as she 
kissed a young man.

&quot;So what? It&#39;s the diplomatic thought that counts. Come on, I know you 
wanna wrap your arms around that adorable sweeper they got.&quot; One by one, 
all the girls went over to congratulate their rivals, even Felicity and 
Fleur, though they weren&#39;t quite as warm about it as the others, and 
Fleur scowled at the poor girl who had injured her. The announcer 
laughed at their wholesome charity.

&quot;Well folks, there&#39;s sportsmanship at its best, and Laudendale deserves 
no less for its incredible debut. Both teams have proven themselves here 
today, and one can only hope they make the same strides in the future. 
I&#39;m Tom Meriworth, and this has been...a good game!&quot; Friends and family 
of the players streamed down to shower praises on them- mostly. Samuel 
Velur made a beeline to his daughter and glared at her; only she could 
hear what he said to her on that field. She wished she had the courage 
to actually stand up to him, or just bury herself and be rid of him 
forever, but she weathered his acidic criticisms as she always did: 
silently, obediently, her spirit always on the verge of breaking. She 
left the field before anybody could see her crying.

If Chairman Helmuth Fitzgerald was affected by this blow against his 
plans, he certainly did a good job of hiding it. His face remained as 
cold, rigid, and impartial as ever; he felt no anger and no loss. 
Rosewood was graciously silent- she respected her younger adversary too 
much to gloat- but she did call for him as he stood up to leave. An 
ambiguous smile came to her lips as she held up her index finger, as if 
to say, &quot;one victory out of the way&quot;. Fitzgerald responded with equal 
ambiguity, holding up two fingers, indicating the obstacles yet to come. 
The true reason he wasn&#39;t upset was because he had planned for Carnegie 
to win: he wanted to arrange for them to play an &quot;easier&quot; opponent 
first, so that their spirits would rise just in time to be completely 
crushed in the next two rounds. And so far, judging from the cheers and 
applause, it was working.

Fitzgerald&#39;s star student wasn&#39;t concerned with his schemes or his 
feelings: she was running out on the field, ready to focus all her 
happiness on Alice and, to a lesser extent, the team as a whole. Even 
though Hawthorne had only played a bit part, Rain was still exuberant 
and proud- two feelings she had been unfamiliar with for most of her 
life. Hawthorne and the soccer team did something to her, something 
dangerous, something wonderful, and Rain knew she would never be the 
same thanks to her exposure. She was almost within arm&#39;s reach when 
something stopped her, grabbing her by the shoulder and turning her 
around.

&quot;Where do you think you are headed to?&quot; It was her fencing teacher, his 
face twitching with impatience. &quot;The match has concluded, and this is 
not the direction of the fencing school.&quot;

&quot;I was just going to say hello to everybody,&quot; she pointed.

&quot;And how much of my time do you think you&#39;ll consume in the process? 
Thirty minutes? An hour? Two hours? I wanted to believe you were more 
responsible than that, Miss Howlet. This time, your condition will not 
save you. I expect you to be at the school and ready for instruction in 
nine minutes. Otherwise, discipline will be too soft a word to describe 
what I might have in store.&quot;

&quot;But sir, you know I won&#39;t be able to make it in nine minutes! That&#39;s a 
fifteen-minute walk from here!&quot;

&quot;Then you should run, and not delay. Nine minutes, Miss Howlet, as of 
now.&quot; Rain fretted and hesitated for one agonizing moment- the choice 
between her duties and her desires had never been so cruel- then turned 
around, squinting her eyes so she wouldn&#39;t weep for the injustice of it 
all, and sprinted as fast as she could towards the fencing school. 
Fitzgerald adjusted his glasses, regarding the celebrations with polite 
indifference before going on his way.
