~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kushinami Arcade 

School was out. For Yui, the day went by as quickly as it came. 
Ever since hearing about the assassination of Sakamoto Gendo, 
the Daigishi whom had probably been one of the few members of 
Diet in opposition to the Koga... things had been moving swiftly 
in Yui&#39;s mind. Though she spent most of the day with Haruko and 
tried to concentrate on her schoolwork; the deep mind of the 
Morioka girl couldn&#39;t help but plan out her next mode of action. 
The Hirotsugu Issue could not wait. Yui was not only being paid 
to end his life... but she had her own issues to deal with as 
well. Which was why she wanted to get to the Diet Building as 
soon as possible. Of course; this was easier said than done with 
Haruko around.

Once classes ended, Yui had tried to make a break for home. They 
she would get changed and head straight for the Diet. But Haruko 
apparently had other ideas. She insisted that Yui come with her 
to Kushinami Arcade again. Yui had protested a little at this, 
saying simply that she had &#39;issues&#39; to take care of at home. But 
one stern and demanding look from Haruko put that all away. And 
Yui could hardly say no to her. There weren&#39;t many who could say 
no to Uchida Haruko when she had set her heart on something. So 
the girl from the north followed the Tokyo-borne class rep 
straight from Kimagure Gakuen to Kushinami Arcade. It was less 
of an Arcade and more of a mix of one; slashing the games 
machines with tables and chairs. At which people could sit and 
order something from the fast food vendor on the other side of 
the Arcade. It mostly sold all those junky, greasy foods that 
had piled up in Japan since the rapid westernisation it 
underwent from the late 1980&#39;s onwards. Places like this were 
even more popular today than they once had been. Which was one 
of the reasons why Haruko had wanted to get here quickly. They 
weren&#39;t the only people from school who came here. And it was 
often hard to find a decent table at Kushinami Arcade during 
weekday afternoons. Just like it was on a busy Saturday. But 
Haruko and Yui had scored big time when they found a free table 
just a little ways south of the games area. To be fair, since 
Haruko was paying for all this; Yui decided to pick up whatever 
food Haruko wanted from the front. Which it as it turns out; 
were a cheeseburger, fries and a shake. Yui really didn&#39;t take 
Haruko for a girl into the dishes of the west. But that was what 
she asked for; so that was what she got. Yui herself didn&#39;t 
bother to buy anything else for herself other than a glass of 
water. Her mind was sort of locked on what she had to deal with 
later on. But not so much that Haruko could see that something 
was wrong. The last thing Yui wanted was for Haruko to question 
her about that. After all... she was trying very hard to keep 
her double lives as separate as possible. The last thing that 
Yui would have wanted would be to involve her newest friend in 
the violent and bloody activities of her alter ego, Shiki. 

Yui brought the food order around to her and Haruko&#39;s table. 
They quickly sat down; and Haruko ate. With disturbingly polite 
manners. For a girl who went to arcades, Haruko came off awfully 
reserved. But they managed to talk a little and enjoy 
themselves. Yui still felt a little drawn to her duties later 
on, but spending time with Haruko did managed to cool her down a 
little. It was another one of the reasons that Yui valued Haruko 
as much as she did. They hadn&#39;t known each other long but the 
class rep had grown important to the country girl.  

Haruko nibbled on one of her fries as she watched a few of the 
boys (from the neighbouring schools of Kimagure Gakuen) try out 
the games of Kushinami Arcade. And one particular scenario had 
caught her eye. Some guy was trying to rack up a high score in 
one of those mini-basketball games. Every time he reached five 
or six though; he missed his target and had to start again. 
Haruko giggled at that. She liked it when people made an effort 
and stuck to it. And it was (truth be told) a pleasure for her 
to see a guy get so scrambled over something so unimportant. 

&quot;Hey Yui-san,&quot; Haruko whispered, pointing to the right, &quot;Check 
out that guy. He could use some real help don&#39;t you think?&quot;

Yui placed her glass of water down and looked around to where 
Haruko had been pointing. She saw the young man that she had 
been pointing to. He threw another few slips of yen to the guy 
who was manning that mini-basketball stall. Then got another 
selection of  b-balls to chuck through the hoop. He failed again 
without beating his previous score. He then scowled and began 
fishing out more money to buy more balls.

Yui blinked. &quot;What&#39;s up with him? What so special about that 
game?&quot;

&quot;Who knows,&quot; Haruko quipped, shrugging, &quot;But you know what guys 
are like. They never want to be outdone at anything. Even if 
they&#39;re not actually competing against anyone.&quot;

Yui tilted her head to the side. &quot;You really think that about 
boys?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, of course I do,&quot; Then the blonde Haruko looked over 
her shoulder with an irritated smile. So look who had shown 
up... &quot;Speaking of which...&quot;

When Yui saw that Haruko&#39;s attention was lost to someone else 
again; Yui followed the look. She peered over her shoulders and 
took a glance at the front of the Arcade. The long glass doors 
parted as a tall figure strode through them; his image obscured 
by the brightness of the sun behind him. Once he walked closer 
to the table, Yui made out who he was without fail. None other 
than Uchida Hibuki, the elder of the Uchida Siblings. Hibuki 
gave a confident smile to the two friends; ignoring those large 
waves of attention he was getting from the female members of the 
crowds in Kushinada Arcade. Hibuki walked up to Yui and Haruko&#39;s 
table, pulled out a chair and took a seat, leaning back with a 
breath. 

Haruko shook her head with irritation. &quot;Look, big brother 
dearest. I don&#39;t know how many times I have to say it before it 
sinks into that thick skull of yours. When you agree to meet 
with me... don&#39;t show up late!&quot; 

&quot;Geez,&quot; Hibuki slung one of his arms over the back of the chair, 
&quot;Do we have to go through this every time we meet up? You know I 
just can&#39;t help coming late sometimes, Haruko-chan. It&#39;s hard 
work for me to get here. Late buses and all that.&quot;

Haruko looked away with a pout. &quot;Sounds like nothing more than 
excuses to me. And while we&#39;re talking; do you mind telling me 
where you were last night? You came home so late that Okaa-san 
was getting worried. And then you zoomed out this morning like a 
flash.&quot;

Though Yui only caught it for a split second, there was a hint 
of seriousness in Hibuki&#39;s eyes from hearing that. Something 
that almost tinged on... sadness. &quot;...I had a few things to 
clear up for my part time job up in Shibuya. I explained it to 
Okaa-san last night. And I left early this morning because I 
have to work on my Art Project. And you remember that don&#39;t you? 
The project that counts for half of my grade in my Art class? 
The one you refuse to help me on?&quot;

Haruko scowled at her brother. &quot;I know you&#39;re not trying to 
blame me for that! You&#39;re my senior at school, you should be 
setting an example for me! I swear, Hibuki-kun. You are so lazy 
when it comes to schoolwork.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, whatever you say, little sis,&quot; Then the eased young man 
looked to his left, locking eyes with Yui. He gave a her a 
bright smile, and realized that he hadn&#39;t even said hello to her 
yet, &quot;How&#39;s it going, Yui-san?&quot;

Yui smiled back and nodded. &quot;Fine. It&#39;s nice to see you again, 
Hibuki-san.&quot;

&quot;You do not have to be so nice to my slacker of a brother, 
Yui-san,&quot; Haruko said, giving her brother a cocky smirk, &quot;He&#39;ll 
probably try and rope you into helping him complete his Art 
project or something.&quot;

Hibuki shook his head. &quot;No, of course not. I&#39;m not that type of 
guy. And Yui-san&#39;s new to the school. I doubt that she could 
help me on it. Besides...&quot;

Hibuki stopped himself when he saw that Yui&#39;s attentions had 
switched to something else. That mini-basketball game that 
Haruko had been point at. Hibuki looked over at it too. Then 
Haruko did the same; just to be a part of the club. By now the 
guy whom had been manning it before had gone. He probably ran 
out of money. At this time; the prizes for the game were 
revealed. A few stuffed animals mostly. Which pretty much 
confirmed to Haruko that the previous schoolboy was on an ego 
trip. Unless he had a weird fondness for plush teddy bears and 
pink monkeys. 

Hibuki then looked back at Yui. &quot;...You wanna try that game out, 
Yui-san?&quot;

&quot;...Well...&quot; The Morioka girl looked downwards, bashfully, 
&quot;...I&#39;d like to have one of those stuffed animals... but I&#39;m not 
so good at those kinds of games. I guess it doesn&#39;t much 
matter.&quot;

&quot;Now, now,&quot; Hibuki cast another look at that mini-basketball 
stall, rolling up the sleeves of his large white school shirt, 
&quot;If you want something then I can&#39;t let you leave empty-handed. 
Especially when you&#39;re one of Haruko-chan&#39;s friends. You have to 
have the patience of the gods to put up with her.&quot;

Haruko scowled at her brother once more. &quot;What did you say?!&quot;

&quot;Lighten up!&quot; Hibuki stood up from the table, leaving the irate 
Haruko and the giggling Yui to walk over to the mini-basketball 
game. He went into the pocket of his school trousers. He 
withdrew his wallet and pulled out some slips of yen. But just 
enough to buy one ball to use. The person at the side of the 
stall took Hibuki&#39;s money and gave him the one ball he bought. 
Maybe a little thrown by the Uchida Brother&#39;s confidence. There 
was no way he could get far with just one ball. Haruko seemed to 
have the same opinion in the matter. She gave a disbelieving 
smile at the sight. Her lazy brother could never get that done. 
Yui remained more curious to the bravado rather than cynical. 
People did tend to surprise you when it came to Tokyo life.

The older of the Uchida siblings stood ahead of the 
mini-basketball stand. He positioned the basketball between both 
hands in an awkward but focused pose. Then he took the shot. The 
ball was launched from his hands and rang straight down the 
hoop. Score!

Haruko blinked. &quot;Meh. Nothing but dumb luck.&quot;

The ball rolled back down the blue fabric of rectangular plastic 
compartment. Till it reached Hibuki&#39;s hands again. And then he 
did the same thing; taking his shot. And he scored. The cynical 
expression on Haruko&#39;s face melted slowly in one of humoured 
surprise as Hibuki repeated the process again and again and 
again. Each time he sunk another basket. Yui gave the older 
youth a warm smile as he began racking up a huge, untainted 
tally. Some of the nearby girls gathered around with charmed 
expressions. While the other boys looked on at the skill this 
seemingly vacant senior was using. He kept up that great run 
until he finally landed his thirtieth basket. Top score! And 
with only one basketball, too! 

The worker of the mini-basketball stall gave an astounded look, 
just as the crowds that had begun surrounding him did. &quot;...Uh... 
well what would you like as a prize...?&quot;

Hibuki looked over at his table and yelled to Yui. &quot;Hey Yui-san! 
What one do you want?!&quot;

The impressed brown-haired girl made her choice. &quot;...Um, how 
about that stuffed panda...?&quot;

Accepted. Hibuki looked over at the owner and pointed out what 
Yui had asked for. The stuffed panda on the side shelf of the 
mini-basketball stand. The worker went over to it and took it 
down and presented it to Hibuki. The Uchida boy nodded in thanks 
then strode over to his table. Where a grateful Yui and a 
stunned Haruko sat. Hibuki handed the panda to Yui and then sat 
down. 

&quot;There you go, Yui-san,&quot; The older youth said, grinning, &quot;Piece 
of cake.&quot;

Yui took the panda with thanks, gave it a warm little hug, then 
smiled at the man whom had won it for her. &quot;Thank you so much, 
Hibuki-san. You were amazing!&quot;

&quot;Naturally,&quot; Hibuki waved his hand at Haruko, &quot;So is there 
anything I can get for you, Haruko-sama? Some humble pie, 
perhaps?&quot;

Haruko shook her fist at her brother. While Hibuki just chuckled 
to himself. Yui watched to two bickering siblings with a smile. 
Experiencing moments like this just served to drive her passion 
even further. These people were her friends now. She had to 
protect them from harm. She had to stop the likes of Hirotsugu.

...To keep safe those she cared about most. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Outside the National Diet Building

In the long stone-paved path to the central Diet building, many 
news reporters had gathered together. It was pitch black. Almost 
ten o&#39;clock at night. Puddles of wetness had settled into the 
pavements from the build up of rain that had poured down since 
the late afternoon. It was a grim time to be involved in 
Japanese Politics. Something that Prime Minister Fujiwara had 
learned for himself; first hand. An elongated limousine pulled 
up to the long path that stretched from the Diet Building to the 
circular roundabout that had been erected a good fifty yards 
from the main building. The second that it came to view, the 
dozens of reporters and Japanese paparazzi gathered around the 
limo sharply to speak with the man inside. Their cries and 
demands to know what Fujiwara&#39;s true opinion was were loud and 
frank. Nobody could have ignored them. The crowds of media 
vultures grew in the fervour as one of the back doors to the 
limo began opening. Two burly black suit bodyguards peeled out 
of the front of the limo and walked back to stand before the 
opening back door. Then emerged the powerless Prime Minister of 
Japan, Fujiwara Jiro. Bright flashes from cameras soon took the 
fold. As did the usual jeering questions,

&quot;Fujiwara-san, what additional comments do you have for the 
Shakai-minshu tou?&quot;

&quot;Fujiwara-san, some of your peers have claimed that this brutal 
killing is too convenient for you and your current Hoshutou-led 
government to be a random occurrence. Do you have anything to 
say in reply to that?&quot;

&quot;Fujiwara-san, do you have any words of sympathy for the family 
of Sakamoto-san?&quot;

The usual questions expected when dealing with such a sensitive 
issue. But he was unwilling to say anymore than he had done at 
the morning media conference. More of the media hounds 
surrounded the PM as he made his way towards the Diet Building. 
They all clambered around him; not just Japanese media, but 
reporters from foreign countries, such as America, Britain, 
China, Korea, Germany, Russia, etc. It was a world affair now. 
And nobody could ignore some of the more glaring facts of the 
case. Sakamoto had been one of the staunchest members of the 
Shakai-minshu tou (Social Democratic Party) and one of the most 
vocal of those apposed to Fujiwara&#39;s Government. Few as they 
were. The assassination seemed to play right into Fujiwara 
Jiro&#39;s hands. That was the outside, unknowing view. These people 
could have had absolutely no idea that Fujiwara was completely 
uninvolved in the murder of Sakamoto. He was irritated by it. 
But he knew that it could not be helped. 

He knew how politics (both national and international) worked in 
this day and age. They lived in a comfortable world. Where the 
slightest graze to the national skin was abhorred. Dozens of his 
political enemies would clamour around this tragedy and use it 
to twist the fabric of their arguments against his leadership. 
It was probably anticipated by Hirotsugu. This effect of 
Sakamoto Gendo&#39;s death. The impact it would have. Just to make 
things harder for him. To make it harder for him to refuse the 
proposal that the Honshu Koga had &#39;offered&#39;. The Prime Minister 
made his way through the roving band of reporters (both foreign 
and home-grown) with his bodyguards to either side of him. All 
the questions, banter and camera flashing was ignored while he 
strode up the large front steps of that large symbol of Japanese 
democracy, the National Diet Building. From this point onwards, 
no common member of the public was allowed so Fujiwara left all 
of his budding crowds back at the front steps. Those who tried 
to force more out of the PM by following him were held back by a 
selection of hulking security officers. Fujiwara stepped into 
the building&#39;s front doors and vanished from public sight. 

Far from the very steps of the building, a good 200 metres away, 
were the surrounding buildings and the traffic beneath them. One 
particular skyscraper stood out. But not because of its design 
or what the people inside it did for a living. It stood out from 
the rest because of the determined shinobi on its roof. In that 
wet night sky, with her body fully adorned in her ninja 
clothing; was Shiki. The murderous alter ego of Hazumaru Yui. 
The kunoichi pressed her foot into the ledge of that tall 
building and smiled from behind her facial wrappings. Looking 
over the scene to the Diet Building. She was a fair distance 
from the building itself but could see all that had happened. 
Her eyesight had been one of the things improved in her 
training. Nothing could escape her vision. But the most 
important thing now would be to speak with Fujiwara himself. 
Shiki knew full well that the PM had to have had some sort of 
contact with Hirotsugu at some point. He would know where to 
find the bastard. And to be brutally honest, Fujiwara was in no 
position to hide anything either. If Yui didn&#39;t kill the Honshu 
Koga soon, then Fujiwara would probably fall to the Six Orochi 
in the same way that Sakamoto Gendo had done. 

Now. To get inside. It would be tough with all these guards 
around. Shiki guessed that she probably should have come to the 
Diet Building earlier, and wait for Fujiwara to arrive. But 
there was no time for regrets. If she couldn&#39;t sneak in under 
the power of her stealth then she would have to rely on her 
Ninjutsu. The Shunhenkou technique. If she could switch bodies 
with someone in the building and then make her way... that would 
work. Shiki quickly made the two-fingered sign of the shinobi 
and shut her eyes. She had to search that place out with the 
power of her Mind&#39;s Eye. Shiki&#39;s mental vision remained blank. 
Her senses had to stay fixed on the inner workings of the Diet 
Building if she ever stood a chance of getting inside it. The 
mental vision of hers soon grew stronger. In her psyche she 
could start making out... the layout of the building. Some of 
the rooms and halls. Heavily guarded from the outside... but not 
so much on the inside. Typical. Security was always tight around 
places as this after dealing with a politically-inclined 
assassination. Shiki soon realized that she couldn&#39;t find the 
exact room in which Fujiwara was going to be. But that didn&#39;t 
really matter. As long as she found a way to get inside; she 
could wing it from there. Her Mind&#39;s Eye kept searching until 
she found someone she could switch with. A sole security guard 
in the west wing. Perfect. She couldn&#39;t meet eyes with him for 
the Shunhenkou; but her Mind&#39;s Eye was strong enough to 
compensate for that (unlike with Ryoko&#39;s Ninjutsu fog; which 
blocked both her Mind&#39;s Eye and her regular eyes). Just the 
right man and place for the job. 

Shiki shot her free hand downwards. &quot;Shunhenkou!&quot;

The kunoichi of fire disappeared in thick puff of greyish smoke 
in that instant. Once the smoke disappeared into the damp night 
air; a burly security guard was left in her place. He gave a 
surprised glimpse around his surroundings and then gasped as he 
realized that he was standing on the roof of a gigantic 
skyscraper. And with that note... Shiki was inside the Diet 
Building.
