~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Inside the Shinrin Jinja

With her fist mounted at her side, Shiki launched herself 
straight for the blinded Yagami. The gap between them closed up 
and the ninja woman of Morioka thrust her fist straight at the 
jaw of the older Yagami. He smirked and swiftly tilted his head 
to one side of the blow. Shiki&#39;s hand went right past it. But 
she didn&#39;t stop there. The woman turned her hips towards the 
right and brought up her leg. She kicked at Yagami&#39;s rib area 
with all the speed she could gather together. Yagami&#39;s wrist 
shot downwards and latched onto Shiki&#39;s ankle before the kick 
reached centimetres of him. Which wasn&#39;t good. As soon as she 
felt herself being dragged inwards by the length of her leg, 
Shiki kicked out of his hold and jumped backwards from the 
taller shinobi. Her lithe body somersaulted backwards through 
the air repeatedly.  Her body then made a graceful landing at a 
fourteen-metre distance from Yagami. But rather than think up a 
better attack plan; Shiki charged straight for Yagami again. And 
though he couldn&#39;t see a thing, Yagami knew exactly what Shiki 
was doing. She came at him again, once more leading in with a 
punch. The footloose boy danced around the blow, avoiding it 
totally. Shiki drew her arm back inward and twisted around to 
try to catch up with Yagami&#39;s actions.  The second she did, her 
eyes bugged out and the wind was robbed from her lungs. Yagami&#39;s 
knee was planted firmly in her chest. So firmly and quickly that 
she hadn&#39;t even seen him move. The bigger fighter withdrew his 
knee from Shiki&#39;s stomach. Then smashed her across the face with 
the back of his right fist. Shiki wailed painfully and was 
thrown right off her feet. She tumbled backwards, falling over 
herself and rolling into a spread position. Her back on the 
floor, her limbs splayed out in opposite directions. Her 
breathing was heavy and her muscles were sore. The Mizuryu 
Gijutsu was still active and her body still burned with the odd 
trace of her green Chi flames, but she was tiring fast. Her 
newfound Mizuryu Gijutsu was powerful... but Yagami was right 
about it. It wouldn&#39;t last forever. And once it ran out, blows 
like his knee to her chest wouldn&#39;t just wind her... they would 
probably break open her ribcage. She was in a race against time 
to win this fight. 

Yagami stood above with an unfazed expression. &quot;Ningen-jutsu 
(Art of Human/Martial Arts)  are completely worthless against 
the Shinda Koukei technique. Every action that you produce will 
create subtle vibrations that will ripple throughout the air. My 
superior senses will pick up on them. And the enhanced speed of 
my thoughts will calculate the best way to defend against and 
counter these assaults.&quot;

Shiki rolled onto her stomach and left arm. &quot;...Y-You&#39;re... 
lying...&quot;

&quot;No I&#39;m not,&quot; Yagami replied, &quot;But don&#39;t take my word for it. 
Try attacking me with martial arts and see for yourself. All 
you&#39;ll be doing is squandering the little time you&#39;ll have left 
for the Mizuryu Gijutsu. And once it fades away completely... 
I&#39;ll kill you. So face it. Face the truth. You are no match for 
the power of the Kagayaku. You never were and you never will be. 
No one person ever was.&quot;

&quot;Arrogant son of a bitch!&quot; Shiki pulled herself up from the 
floor and shot over at Yagami. As she charged him she made a 
quick leap upwards and drew back both of her fists to her sides. 
Her hips made a swift turn, projecting her left leg towards her 
blind rival. Yagami&#39;s eyebrows rose in understanding of both 
direction and strength. His body shifted to one side of the kick 
and projected one of his own. Shiki gasped at the failure of her 
attack and then screamed as Yagami delivered a roundhouse blow 
to the back of her head. The clapping force of the kick pushed 
Shiki further ahead on her stumbling legs. Leaving her back open 
for another slash from the Mikazuki Satsujinki. Yagami drew it 
from behind on his back; then gave a ruthless stroke across the 
back of Shiki. Again. The Morioka Kunoichi grit her teeth and 
seethed a frustrated squeal from between them. Not only did that 
attack slice open a fresh wound on her body... but it cut across 
the one that had already been administered to her. Blood dripped 
freely from both wounds. Which had been awkwardly forged into a 
sort of cross shape. Shiki turned around and watched the silent 
Yagami whilst he waited for a new attack. He was right about 
martial arts not working against him. He hadn&#39;t been lying. But 
that didn&#39;t exclude all of Shiki&#39;s options. All she had to do 
was work fast. If not then the Mizuryu Gijutsu would surely wear 
off and leave her almost helpless. 

The girl thrust her hands into both of the shuriken pouches at 
the side of her leg. And hooked her fingers into the holes of 
six of them, three on either hand. Shiki had twelve shuriken 
left. Once she used these six, that would cut the number of 
shuriken she had left in half. But she had to take the shot now. 
The woman then withdrew all six of them in her two hands and 
crossed her arms in front of her chest. A few seconds later; 
those hands were burning with the smouldering emerald fire of 
her spirit. Thus igniting the six shuriken. 

Shiki braced herself, and then through all six of her 
flaming-jade shuriken at Yagami in a horizontal motion of the 
arms. &quot;Mizuryu Style! Roku Shuri-Hou!&quot; 

The six fire shuriken zoomed over at the target, Yagami. The 
Commander of the Six Orochi waited on. His facial expression 
twisted into one of alarm. Understanding. He was aware of the 
attack by now. His strapping young arm twirled around to get the 
Mikazuki Satsujinki into position, his body leaning forwards.  

&quot;Frontal assaults will do you no good either!&quot; He barked, right 
before showing her this. He twisted his glaive to one side and 
deflected the first shuriken. Then he did the same for the 
second and third. He then span the glaive around and around in 
front of him until it created almost a protective shield. The 
remaining three shuriken bounced off the spinning glaive with 
clashing sounds of metal. Each of the shuriken were batted away 
so quickly that they went flying in opposite directions from 
Yagami&#39;s point. The kind of result that Shiki was expecting. The 
young woman made the two-fingered sign of the shinobi and 
slipped her intent green eyes shut. She then began concentrating 
all of her power and attention on the six shuriken that Yagami 
had deflected. They all span away, but in that second; they 
froze and hovered silently in mid-air. Still burning with the 
power of Shiki&#39;s jade-tone spirit fire. The following second 
they then began returning to the person whom had reflected the 
attacks. Yagami&#39;s face showed his attention to the returning 
shuriken. 

Yagami re-gripped the Mikazuki Satsujinki with two hands. 
&quot;...You re-routed the direction of the shuriken using Zanmaru&#39;s 
skill. Interesting. But still meaningless...&quot;

He reattached the glaive to his back and made the two-fingered 
sign. The shadow beneath his feet began growing and growing 
until it was surrounding him in a circular dark shape. The 
Kagetoho technique. Yagami smiled for no reason in particular, 
then let his whole body sink into the shadow beneath him. The 
six shuriken slashed over his head but didn&#39;t scrape a single 
hair from it. By the time they reached the point of attack; 
Yagami&#39;s head had been swallowed up by the darkness. 

Shiki grinned as the shadow beneath her own feet began to grow 
in size, her thin long fingers still making the shinobi sign. 
&quot;...Now! Shunhenkou!&quot;

She then disappeared in a loud puff of spiritual smoke. Once the 
smoke began to fade, a surprised Yagami was replaced in that 
position. Standing above the widening shadow. While Shiki rose 
up from that shadow herself. Head, shoulders and body. It was 
the one unguarded instant she had been waiting for. The girl 
swiftly withdrew Miyuki from its sheath and gave a sharp stab 
forwards. Yagami projected a foul grunt of agony as the short 
sword roughly stabbed him straight through the side of the 
abdomen. Right through his toned back, grazing his strong organs 
and reappearing through the front of the stomach. A fresh 
coating of blood covered the blade. The stab was urgent in 
nature so was awkwardly aimed. But still did its damage all the 
same. Yagami choked up a gob of blood, which splattered in small 
puddles on the floorboards of the Room of Present. Shiki ripped 
out the sword from the torso of the stunned Yagami. Then jumped 
out of the shadows below. She delightfully backflipped from that 
position and landed a good few metres away. With a keen chuckle 
in her throat. Using her essential Shunhenkou technique, she had 
managed to reverse the power of Yagami&#39;s Shadow Walking skill 
against him, using it to her own advantage.  

Yagami gripped the wound at his stomach and coughed, blood 
staining his lips. &quot;...Very good. Your skills are better than I 
gave you credit for... but I refuse to  die here... I am going 
to win this fight...&quot;

Once that was said, Yagami firmed his hold over the Mikazuki 
Satsujinki. Shiki could tell that he was going on the offensive. 
The Fifth Orochi ignored the pain throbbing at his abdomen and 
jumped straight upwards into the air. His movements were swift. 
If not for the Mizuryu Gijutsu, her eyes would not have been 
able to keep up with them. Yagami&#39;s blurred body vaulted 
straight up into the air of the Room of Present. He turned 
around mid-jump so that he was facing his adversary, the girl 
from Morioka. There was a pause; right before Yagami swooped in 
with an even greater speed, like a bird of prey on the hunt.  
Shiki could not keep up with this attack at all, but remembered 
it well. 

&quot;Kagayaku Mangetsu Zan!&quot; Yagami bellowed, right before landing 
it. 

A wisp of a chime sound filled the air. Right before Shiki 
screamed. The fast image of Yagami swooping down on her went 
past with a flash, and a subsequent tear of her clothing. And a 
rough spurt of blood that leaked from the fresh wound at her 
left arm. Yagami zoomed all the way over to the far wall from 
the momentum of the Kagayaku Full Moon Slash. His sandals 
pressed into the fall and he braced himself against it for a 
follow up to the previous attack. Yagami thrust himself off that 
wall in the following seconds and made a second attempt for the 
K.F.M.S. Shiki held the deep gash on her injured arm. She could 
hardly move it due to the pain. One arm down and Yagami was 
about to land a second strike. He was closing in as fast as 
ever.  There was only one hope. If he injured the other arm like 
this then the fight was over. Not to mention the fact that Shiki 
could feel that the Mizuryu Gijutsu running low. The girl closed 
one of her eyes and brought up her un-injured arm. Making the 
two-finger sign. She couldn&#39;t use Shunhenkou when he was moving 
at that speed. But there was one last thing she hadn&#39;t tried. 
Keeping her focus strictly on the task; Shiki took a deep breath 
and began the process of gathering her Chi. Yagami was in metres 
of her. He held the Mikazuki Satsujinki at his side and aimed 
for the jugular. Literally. 

And had it been attempted purely a second earlier than that... 
then Yagami would instantly have killed her. &quot;Mizuryu Style! 
Monosugoi Uma Hitoiki!&quot;

Shiki&#39;s bright flaming soul ignited with a great passion and 
intensity that triggered off the most powerful Ninjutsu she 
could muster. A broad halo of searing-hot emerald fire 
surrounded her and acted as not only a method of defence; but of 
attack as well. Yagami was blown straight out of his Kagayaku 
Mangetsu Zan. The amazing force of the Monosugoi Uma Hitoiki 
rammed into his stomach and burned savagely at his flesh. The 
body of the Kagayaku descendant was thrown from Shiki and sent 
straight back towards the opposite wall. Once the ring spread 
away from the Morioka girl, she acted like lightning and went 
for Miyuki. This would probably be the only time that Yagami 
would be totally unguarded so she made the effort to end this as 
quickly as possible. Shiki withdrew Miyuki from its sheath and 
then threw the long dagger right at Yagami. As soon as the young 
man&#39;s back smashed against the back wall of the Room of Present, 
Miyuki followed him. And the steel blade, sharpened with acids, 
sliced straight through his chest. Yagami&#39;s throat gave a 
breathless gasp. Miyuki shot through his ribcage and sliced past 
his lungs, reappearing through the wooden frame of the wall. 

A new trail of blood dripped down the corner of his mouth. Just 
as easily as it came down, it made Yagami aware of the outcome 
of this fight. Shiki had won. The legendary power of the 
flawless Kagayaku bloodline... was defeated. Yagami&#39;s head 
slumped. And a smile played upon those lips. Not a smile of joy. 
One of earnest depression and sadness. He was beaten. As were 
the Six Orochi. Whoever the Sixth Orochi was... there was no way 
he could get here in time to amend the failures of the previous 
five. It was over. 

While Yagami remonstrated, Shiki fell to one knee and gasped for 
breath. All the attacks and Ninjutsu she had used had drained 
her Chi supply. The Mizuryu Technique had run out too. All of 
the green spirit fire that had been surrounding her earlier was 
now vanishing. But it had served her well. Bringing out her full 
potential. It was enough to defeat Yagami. And thusly Shiki had 
enough left in her to finish off Hirotsugu. The young woman 
stood up after getting some air into her. Then looked at the 
defeated descendant of the Kagayaku Family. He might not have 
been the most honourable person out there... but he was a worthy 
shinobi. If only he had the sense not to use Hirotsugu&#39;s 
ambitions as expression of those talents. The tired Shiki walked 
over to the downed Yagami. Impaled on her short blade. Shiki 
stopped just as she came within five metres of him. He had 
proven to be her greatest challenge. For that... Yagami had 
earned her respect.

The dying boy looked up with one open eye socket. &quot;...W-Well 
done... g-girl of Morioka... you&#39;ve beaten me... and assured 
yourself of... a meeting with... Hirotsugu-sama.&quot;

Shiki nodded. &quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;...Tell him... I&#39;m sorry... that the Kagayaku bloodline... has 
failed him...&quot;

And then Yagami&#39;s head slumped downwards in an awkward position. 
The Fifth Orochi was dead. Shiki kept her face still and then 
gripped the smooth bamboo hilt of Miyuki. She slowly removed the 
blade from Yagami&#39;s skewered chest. After wiping it free of the 
blood and then sheathing it; Shiki turned and ran for the next 
door. It was time for the opportunity that she had been waiting 
for since she came to Tokyo. The girl dashed across the Room of 
Present (which was now on fire) and began the dash through the 
door and down the corridor. That followed it. The space around 
that area was darker due to the lack of light at the far door at 
the end of the corridor. But she kept a fast pace as she ran for 
it. And suddenly memories began surfacing of the past... 

Her past...

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;The existence of a shinobi demands nothing other than skill and 
offers nothing more than servitude, bloodshed and death. This is 
how we must express ourselves. Outside of this, who you are 
means nothing.&quot;

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

You can&#39;t mean this...

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;We are powerful and we are deadly. But we possess one weakness. 
We are human. The eternal struggle of the shinobi is to overcome 
this sense of humanity. For mankind&#39;s morals have no place in 
the shinobi order.&quot;

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

...Am I worthless...? 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;Kindness is for the infirm, peace is for the feeble and mercy 
for the weak.&quot; 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

...But why? Please... 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;A shinobi who possesses emotion is the mark of a shinobi who 
has failed in their mission before it has even begun...&quot; 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

...Please, don&#39;t...

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;You need only know this, Yui... you are only a weapon.&quot; 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

...Don&#39;t abandon me, Otou-san... 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Shiki ignored her feelings no longer. It was all rushing to the 
surface. As she neared the Room of Fates. The woman from Morioka 
slowed down and then took a stop in front of the door. It was 
time... to face...the Honshu Koga. Shiki growled and kicked open 
that wooden door, shattering it into shreds. She then stepped 
forwards and walked to the bleak room. Towards the shadowy 
centre of the hall was the mastermind and cause behind all of 
this. The one single man who forced Shiki to the edge of her 
limits and beyond. 

Hirotsugu. 

The older man had his back to silent girl. But he stood upright 
from his seated position, with the Scroll of Kokomaru below his 
feet. And his aged lips parted with both smile and speech, 
addressing the Burning Kunoichi.

&quot;...It&#39;s been seven long years...&quot; He spoke, &quot;...Welcome back, 
Mizuryu Yui...&quot;

Shiki scowled, seething. &quot;...Father...&quot;
