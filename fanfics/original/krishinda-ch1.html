**********
 
13 years ago, in the mystical land of Juukumei, the half-century long 
war between humans and angels came to an end. The omen of the end of 
the war was a massive earthquake that ripped through the world. It 
released six powerful creatures onto the surface. These creatures now 
stalk the land and terrorise its inhabitants. At the present, five 
unique characters have come together to end this evil once and for 
all.
 
However, things are not always as they seem. And the only way to save 
the future may be to uncover the secrets of the past...
 
**********
 
One blow struck. A second, a third. A sharp slice to follow them up. 
Akira struck at the training dummy again with her sleek wooden sword, 
her long ponytail of black hair whipping up over her shoulders with 
the thrust. After a final, sharp, angular blow, the young woman 
collapsed to the ground in exhaustion. Akira laid the sword to rest 
next to her knees, tucked in beneath her. It was foolish to train at 
this point, in some twisted way Akira knew that, but she didn&#146;t much 
care. 
 
Today was the day.
 
Today was the day, that Akira Kusagana became a fully-fledged knight 
of the 7th Order. 
 
She had been preparing for this day for as long as she could remember. 
Under the watchful eye of her master, Genzo Kiryu, her skills had 
grown from those of an insignificant novice to those of a masterful 
warrior&#146;s. Akira herself was surprised at the amount of progress she 
made when she *really* looked at it, but Akira was never satisfied 
with that. After all, she had a legacy to uphold. She was the daughter 
of Hyudo Kusagana, the legendary crusader who led the Gammakai squad 
into victory over the Tenshi-jin. Living under the darkness of her 
father&#146;s shadow cast fear into Akira. Would she be good enough? Would 
she make her father proud? 
 
Akira sighed out loud. Even she didn&#146;t know herself. Besides, not even 
the Tenshi-jin could match up to the power of the six devils. They 
would be her targets. And when Genzo passes on, she would be the new 
leader of the Heaven Slayers. Then she would see if her skills were 
enough to match up to those of her father&#146;s. 
 
Akira meekly stood up off the ground, steadying herself with her 
sword. While standing she looked at her wooden sword. Good old 
Mokuken. When it was first given to her by Genzo, it was fresh, and 
invigorating to hold, full of Mana-Ki. Now, nearly all of its Mana-Ki 
had been drained, through battles and intense training. It was now 
fatigued, withered and worn-in. And in only two hours a whole new 
sword would replace it. Still, Akira felt a little sentimental while 
holding Mokuken. Her old buddy had been there for her throughout the 
ruff times, when she didn&#146;t think she&#146;d make it as a knight for the 
7th Order.
 
A small smile traced its way across Akira&#146;s lips. 
 
&#147;I&#146;ll miss you, sweetie.&#148;
 
The sentimentality left Akira however, when she looked back at the 
training statue before her. She chose to train a little before the 
ceremony and now she was going to go through with it. After yelling a 
war-flash, Akira plunged Mokuken at the dummy again. Only a few meters 
away behind the bushes of the Kiryu family training garden, Mitsuki 
Kiryu watched Akira in quiet awe. Her grandfather had not exaggerated 
Akira&#146;s power. Each slash Akira preformed was carefully executed and 
perfectly timed. Needless to say, it astounded Mitsuki. She herself 
was a healer. She had no powers to fight with like Akira, no hidden 
strength. Mitsuki respected Akira for it, especially since she was a 
girl. Women didn&#146;t have a lot of influence in the 7th Order. The only 
female knight she knew was Miki, so the fact that Akira was about to 
be appointed a Knight for the Order was really a great achievement, 
despite her lineage. But Mitsuki didn&#146;t just feel respect for Akira 
though. She had long since come to terms with the fact that she was in 
love with Akira. 
 
It happened a while ago. Four years back, Akira had been brought here 
to the Kiryu training grounds by her grandfather, Genzo. At first, 
Mitsuki just saw her as an acquaintance, and then she became a friend. 
Then a close friend and then her best friend. Then, just recently, 
something a little more. Mitsuki had tried to present her feelings 
towards Akira many times since then, but she just couldn&#146;t quite find 
the words. She still felt shy about it. And Akira was always too 
wrapped up in training to even look twice at her. In the end, Mitsuki 
decided to keep her feelings hidden. It wasn&#146;t easy, though, but she 
did it. 
 
{I still think Akira is cute when she&#146;s all intense like that. I wish 
I could tell you.} Mitsuki thought.
 
It all seemed so easy, right? Just tell Akira the truth? But things 
are never that simple. At least not for Mitsuki. She had Kai to think 
about...
 
*********
 
At the far gates of the Kiryu training grounds, a young man on a white 
horse. He was of medium height, had short blonde hair with smouldering 
chestnut eyes. The man was wearing a white shirt beneath a leather 
mini bomber jacket, and a pair of dark trousers, linked around his 
waist by means of some metal chains. He was also wearing a white 
bandana, and two iron bracers around wrists. As he reached the front 
gates he quickly dismounted, and strode up to the two guards in his 
path. The two guards quickly crossed their spears at the front of the 
gates and stared at him with contempt.
 
&#147;Halt,&#148; the first guard said. &#147;State your business.&#148;
 
The man smirked at the two guards for a second, and unlocked the 
bracer around his left wrist, revealing a long tattoo of an ancient 
dragon. 
 
&#147;I&#146;m Anju Raioh, second of the Twelve Dragons.&#148;
 
Both guards sweat-dropped and lowered their spears.
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry sir Anju, but we must take precautions.&#148; Said the second 
guard. 
 
Anju smirked again, lowering his wrist and walking past them 
arrogantly.
 
&#147;Yeah, yeah. Just get outta my way. And have someone tell Genzo about 
my arrival.&#148;
 
The two guards nodded, and bowed respectively. 
 
&#147;Yes sir.&#148;
 
Anju walked into the Kiryu training grounds through the gates, and he 
marvelled at the fact that in over seven years, this place had still 
not changed much. Same statues and random guards, same smell, same all 
round theme. It felt good to Anju though. He was afraid that coming 
back here after so long would have been a little...awkward, but it 
appeared to be just the same as before. Anju intended on speaking to 
an old &#145;friend&#146; here in addition to joining the Heaven Slayers, and as 
he neared the far chapel on the grounds, that &#145;old friend&#146; made 
herself known.
 
&#147;Well, well. When did the Kiryu start to need mercenaries?&#148; 
 
Anju turned around quickly to the voice that viciously called out to 
him, but he only smiled sheepishly at her. 
 
&#147;When they woke up to the fact that the second Dragon&#146;s skills were 
invaluable to their aims.&#148; Anju walked closer to the woman. 
 
&#147;It&#146;s been a while Miki...&#148;
 
Anju laid eyes upon the woman he had not seen for the past seven 
years. Miki was insanely beautiful. Possessing a seductively alluring 
and divinely sculpted body, beaming maturity amidst gorgeousness. 
Long, hazelnut brown hair, two thick locks of it braided around her 
forehead, blazing emerald eyes and soft ivory skin. She was wearing a 
buttoned white shirt, a maroon coloured skirt cut halfway around her 
calves and a silver neck chain, with them emblem of the Soujumah clan, 
the flaming lion.
 
Miki was very much perfect. Not only was she intelligent and 
beautiful, but also she was powerful. Her rank as the 73rd knight of 
the 7th Order proved this.   
 
Miki&#146;s eyes thinned into little slits as Anju stepped closer to her, 
automatically clenching her fists at his advances. Anju stopped in 
front of Miki, and gently ran his fingers through her long, hazelnut 
hair, grinning playfully at her.
 
&#147;...And you&#146;re still just as beautiful as you were then...&#148;
 
Miki closed her eyes. She was afraid of this. Anju was as much of a 
sweet talker now as he was back then. She should stop this. After what 
he did, he didn&#146;t have any liberty to speak to her like that, right? 
Following a second of doubt, Miki pulled herself away from Anju and 
glared at him.
 
&#147;That was a long time ago. Things have changed. I changed.&#148;
 
Anju grinned again. He expected this from Miki. It was understandable 
considering the history between the two of them.
 
&#147;I can see. But it was good...what we had, wasn&#146;t it?&#148;
 
Miki looked hard at Anju. &#147;We have more important things to do then 
reminisce about old times. You were hired for a reason.&#148;
 
Miki&#146;s personality hadn&#146;t changed either. She was still more 
pre-occupied with business rather then pleasure. Anju suddenly became 
serious as Miki watched him.
 
&#147;We need to take care of the six devils, right? Do you think that if 
it was this simple, Juukumei would still have to suffer their 
darkness?&#148;
 
&#147;You don&#146;t know how powerful Hyudo&#146;s daughter is. She&#146;s just sixteen, 
yet her talents already match mine.&#148;
 
Anju sighed and walked over to the balcony that was facing the inner 
courtyard. He looked out distantly.
 
&#147;She&#146;s been trained by the Kiryu. I suppose that&#146;s worth something. 
But do you really think one girl can be enough?&#148; 
 
&#147;Genzo seems to think so.&#148; Miki said.
 
Anju chuckled lightly to himself. &#147;...Genzo thinks that...what about 
you then, huh?&#148;
 
&#147;...It...does not matter what I think. My duty is to watch over her.&#148;
Anju turned around, leaning on the balcony, and stared incredulously 
at the hazelnut haired woman.
 
&#147;And that means you&#146;re not entitled to an opinion?&#148;
 
Miki looked away from Anju and stared at the far walls. Although Anju 
was a trifler, he could be very serious when he wanted to be. She 
liked this side of him more that others.
 
&#147;I have faith in Genzo&#146;s decision. And if you don&#146;t believe in it, why 
did you even bother to accept his offer?&#148;
 
&#147;Heh, heh. If I&#146;m gonna die, I&#146;d prefer to die fighting the six 
devils. And...&#148; Anju winked at Miki. &#147;I&#146;d never pass up the 
opportunity to see you again.&#148;
 
Miki sighed at that and walked away from him. Things still don&#146;t 
change, do they? 
 
**********
 
Two hours later, many people from inside the training grounds, and 
some innocent spectators from Zaakumaikyuu, gathered in the main 
chapel. This was a big event, for all of the people of Juukumei to 
celebrate about, but only a selected few could watch this in person. 
Great effort had gone in to this, and all the people seated in the 
large, musky chapel were astounded at the holy and sacred ornaments, 
the moderate decorations and that mystical atmosphere that was around 
them all. Akira was in formal 7th Order dress, a feminine armour, 
mainly for special ceremonies, and she was kneeling in front of the 
large stone altar, awaiting the arrival of the one who would bestow 
her with Knighthood. Mitsuki and Miki watched from the far doors, Anju 
was on the upper floor, leaning over the banister and watching Akira 
with some amusement, and Genzo was waiting by the chapel doors. After 
a delayed wait, the chapel doors opened slowly, and revealed a man who 
was considered the hero of Juukumei. 
 
With three guards behind him, the man called Ryuma Kakounji gaited up 
through the cheers and yells from star-struck commoners and fans. 
Ryuma was literally a celebrity. He was the legendary warrior who 
defeated the evil angel Tensatsu right before the great earthquake, 
nearly thirteen years ago. Many stories had been told about his 
heroism and bravery, and hundreds of women across Juukumei were simply 
haunted and mesmerized by his noble grace and handsome looks. Akira 
herself envied him almost as much as she envied her father. She didn&#146;t 
resent Ryuma, but a quiet jealously lay beneath her respect for him. 
 
Ryuma carefully walked up to the stone altar, and waited for the 
cheers from the all of the people around him to stop. Mitsuki and Miki 
watched Ryuma with mild interest, while Anju looked down at the hero 
of Juukumei with a scowl. He didn&#146;t trust Ryuma as far as he could 
throw him.
 
{There&#146;s just something about him.} Anju thought. 
 
Ryuma waited patiently for the end of the fanfare, and as it died 
down, he coughed to clear his throat, and tossed tresses of his long 
dark hair over his shoulders. 
 
&#147;Citizens of Juukumei, righteous knights of the 7th Order, faithful 
members of the Kiryu clan. We are all gathered here today to witness 
the birth of a new warrior. A powerful warrior who is the sole 
descendent of a great man, Hyudo Kusagana, a warrior who has a great 
destiny. To free Juukumei from the terror of the six devils.&#148;
 
Ryuma looked down to Akira.
 
&#147;Rise and step forward, Kusagana Akira.&#148;
 
Akira slowly stood up, and walked up to the altar, quickly bowing to 
Ryuma in respect. Ryuma bowed also, and a priest walked up to Ryuma, 
holding a plush and decorated pillow, carrying the sacred Dragon-edge 
sword. Ryuma bowed to the priest as he lifted the sacred sword off of 
the pillow. He then walked around the altar, and stood before a rather 
apprehensive Akira.
 
&#147;I place this holy blade in your hands, as symbol of you new 
appointment. Use it well, and trust in the blade in the same way that 
it now trusts you.&#148;
 
Akira bowed again, and respectfully took the sword from Ryuma&#146;s hands. 
Akira&#146;s eyes widened in sheer surprise as she felt the amount of 
Mana-Ki within the blade. Shaped in the form of a katana, the 
Dragon-edge was overflowing with latent power. It was to be expected 
though. Only three swords of this calibre were ever forged. This 
sword, the Dragon-edge, her father&#146;s sword, the Lightning-edge, and 
Ryuma&#146;s sword, the Mist-edge. It was a great honour to be allowed to 
wield this legendary weapon. 
 
Ryuma smiled at Akira.
 
&#147;I now pronounce you, Akira Kusagana, as the 113th knight of the 7th 
Order.&#148;
 
People then began to ecstatically cheer and cry at the birth of a new 
knight. Ryuma and Akira bowed to each other again, and Ryuma made his 
way to the chapel doors. The people continued to cheer for Akira, and 
she blushed lightly at the amount of support she had. Mitsuki watched 
Akira from the sidelines. She felt a bit dwarfed by Akira and her 
popularity. But that didn&#146;t shake Mitsuki&#146;s feelings for her. Mitsuki 
nudged at Miki.
 
&#147;I think Akira&#146;s a little embarrassed to be in the spotlight.&#148;
 
Miki let out a small smile. &#147;Wouldn&#146;t you be if you were in her 
position? Great deals of people are counting on her. And counting on 
us.&#148; 
 
&#147;What do you mean?&#148; Mitsuki asked.
 
&#147;We have to protect and guard her while she hunts down all of the six 
devils. Our roles are as crucial as Akira&#146;s is.&#148;
 
Miki&#146;s face then looked confused for a second, and she looked at 
Mitsuki.
 
&#147;But I&#146;m curious, why are you joining the Heaven Slayers? I know you 
are a healer, so you will be invaluable, but still there are others 
who could take your place. And you are marrying Kai, aren&#146;t you?&#148;
 
Mitsuki&#146;s face then became darker, more distant and foreboding then it 
usually was.
 
&#147;My grandfather arranged my engagement to Kai. I don&#146;t love him.&#148;
 
Miki smiled. &#147;I know you don&#146;t.&#148;
 
&#147;So then why must I marry him?&#148; 
 
Miki looked at Akira again, still looking self-conscious and nervous, 
then looked back at Mitsuki. In her heart she knew the direction their 
relationship was headed, but sometimes duty was more important then 
personal feelings. Miki had learned this first hand.
 
&#147;If you marry Kai, you will unite my clan, the Soujumah clan with your 
clan, the Kiryu clan. It will strengthen the both of them.&#148; 
 
Mitsuki looked up at Miki blankly. &#147;And that&#146;s more important then my 
happiness?&#148;
 
&#147;Of course not.&#148;
 
Mitsuki looked away again. &#147;So why did my grandfather arrange it when 
he knows that I won&#146;t be happy?&#148;
 
&#147;Genzo loves you. But he also has the clan&#146;s best interests in mind.&#148;  
  
Mitsuki sighed. &#147;I guess so. Anyway that&#146;s not important now. All I 
really care about at this point is protecting Akira.&#148;
 
**********
 
&#147;You have a difficult journey ahead of you, Akira. Are you prepared 
for this? After tomorrow, there will be no turning back.&#148; Genzo said. 
 
The two were in Genzo&#146;s private meditation room, a serene room with 
artificial water springs and bonsai plants. It felt calming to simply 
be in here, Akira thought. Akira then thought about what Genzo said. 
She had been waiting for this day for twelve years, and had been 
waiting anxiously for as long as she could remember. But when it 
finally came, when she finally became a knight, Akira really didn&#146;t 
know what to think. Was she ready? Although the majority of the 7th 
Order supported her, some were sceptical about giving her the 
Dragon-edge and putting her in the Heaven Slayers. Just because her 
father was a great warrior, it didn&#146;t necessarily make her one. And 
Akira was never satisfied with her powers; no matter how many times 
people told her that that they were second to none. 
 
&#147;I...think so.&#148; Akira said.
 
Genzo stepped towards Akira and looked hard at her.
 
&#147;I have trained you well, Akira. But if you doubt yourself, only death 
will await you.&#148;
 
Akira looked away. Genzo was always so very blunt.
 
&#147;But what about my father? How can I live up to him?&#148; 
 
&#147;You and your father are two different people. You will never be 
Hyudo. You know that. But you also know that you should not try to 
emulate him. You must follow your own path and etch your own destiny. 
Only when you realize that, will you know for yourself.&#148;
 
Akira smiled. &#147;Thank you, Master Kiryu.&#148;
 
Genzo smiled back. He felt close to Akira, as if she were his own 
child. He had watched out for Hyudo&#146;s daughter since she was a little 
girl, and had seen how grown up Akira had become. 
 
&#147;I know you&#146;ll make Hyudo and I very proud, Akira.&#148;
