<h1>Blood, Sex, and Magik (part 9 of 27)</h1>

<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        Jess washed her hands, picking up the ink brushes before going 
back into her work room. The young lady sat on the table dressed only in 
her panties, her short blonde hair falling around her face. Her breasts 
were shadowed by her posture, but they were well shaped and perky. Half 
in shadow her face was lovely, delicate and almost elven.

        And she was also partially a he. From what Jess heard she didn&#39;t 
work the streets for her money; instead she operated out of one of the 
highest priced establishments in the city. That was why Jess had been a 
bit surprised to see this woman at her door, and even more surprised at 
her request.

        &quot;Thank you for agreeing to do this,&quot; Lane said quietly.

        Jess set the bowl that was partially filled with black ink down 
on a work tray that was sitting near the table, a bit of water in a cup 
where the brushes waited to be used. &quot;My door is open to all,&quot; Jess 
said. A slight smile twitched her lips, &quot;Though I must admit I had to 
think about it a moment when you came in.&quot;

        Lane chuckled softly, &quot;I do that to a lot of people, I think.&quot; 
She turned her head slightly and smiled, &quot;You aren&#39;t quite what I was 
expecting.&quot;

        Jess took one of the delicate brushes from the water, pressing 
down gently to get all of the fluid out. She twirled the point up 
against the edge of the glass, and then dipped it carefully in the black 
ink. &quot;Bend forward a bit,&quot; Jess instructed Lane gently, &quot;I need to get 
good light on your back.&quot; She carefully traced the brush across the slim 
shoulders to form the upper edge of a wing as she asked, &quot;How was I 
unexpected?&quot;

        Lane shivered slightly at the feeling of the brush on her skin. 
&quot;Do you have a reputation, you know,&quot; she murmured softly.

        Jess leaned forward, blowing lightly on the ink to dry it a bit 
quicker. &quot;Oh?&quot; she asked, dipping the brush into water, preparing it, 
then gathering more ink.

        &quot;Ah!&quot; Lane shuddered as Jess blew, hot flesh meeting cold air. 
&quot;You&#39;re a mystery, the enigmatic tattoo artist who seems to know so much 
more than she should. The city&#39;s powers walk cautiously around you,&quot; she 
finished, &quot;as if you were a power yourself.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not a power,&quot; Jess said firmly as she painted, carefully 
creating the illusion of wings on the slim girl&#39;s back, &quot;not anymore.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s not true, you know,&quot; Lane said looking over at her 
shoulder at Jess with a sad little smile, &quot;or else I wouldn&#39;t be here.&quot;

        Jess leaned in to work on the fine details, hiding her face from 
Lane&#39;s gaze as she said, &quot;You might be right, but I hope not.&quot;

        The work went on mostly quietly, Jess changing brushes as she 
went. The outside structure was done first, the shape of the wings 
designed carefully, arching up at the edge of her shoulder blades the 
sweeping down to the base of her back, stopping just below the top of 
the delicate panties. With even more care she filled in each wing, 
delicately designing each feather for the wings. It took some time, Lane 
laying there on her stomach for much of it, but finally the painting was 
done.

        Jess took a mirror, moving to hold it so that Lane could get a 
look at her back. &quot;What do you think? She asked with a slight smile.

        &quot;It&#39;s lovely,&quot; Lane sighed softly.

        &quot;Too bad it&#39;s just going to disappear,&quot; Jess said with a shrug.

        &quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; Lane said, her voice dropping to a whisper.

        &quot;Trust me,&quot; Jess said seriously, &quot;there&#39;s no way you&#39;re ready.&quot;

        All around the darkened room carefully placed candles flickered 
to life, bright flames glowing golden and red. Around the table Jess 
moved, writing with one of the brushes on the tarps and sheets laid out 
on the floor. A circle, inscribed with runes in many tongues, a soft 
glow shimmering from the lines of oddly glowing ink.

        Jess laid her hands on the bare back, tracing the painted on 
wings delicately. The words that she spoke were soft, guttural, and 
violently different than any known language of man. It almost seemed to 
predate human language, sounds with greater meaning and depth, sounds 
that carried mystical power in their very structure. The black ink 
shimmered darkly, sinking down into the woman&#39;s flesh leaving no trace 
of their passing.

        The woman on the table shifted, a shudder wracking the delicate 
form. There was a soft noise from the back of Lane&#39;s throat, a weak 
gasp. &quot;It.. pinches, aches,&quot; she managed to choke out.

        The flesh of Lane&#39;s bare back shifted beneath Jess&#39; fingers, the 
woman&#39;s voice rising as she chanted onward. The skin bulged outward, 
Lane crying out with agony as her body seemed to twist, her flesh and 
even the bones beneath shifting.

        &quot;Brace yourself,&quot; Jess had a scalpel in hand.

        &quot;Do it,&quot; Lane groaned.

        Jess cut into the flesh in a decisive gesture, sweeping the 
blade down one side of Lane&#39;s back. Blood and gore splattered the tall 
woman as a single white wing exploded from the wound to stretch up to 
the ceiling, flopping down to the ground. Ignoring the groans of pain 
Jess went around to the other side, setting another burst of wetness 
free. The twin wings were blood splattered, oil and gore soaking them, 
but beneath it they shone purest white.

        &quot;Oh god,&quot; Lane murmured weakly, trying to push herself up off 
the table. She took in the wings, hanging limp and wet, and her eyes 
widened. Breathlessly she managed &quot;You did it.&quot;

        &quot;I said I would, seraphim,&quot; Jess helped her sit up, noticing the 
woman had bit down so hard on her lower lip that it was bleeding. &quot;You 
are going to need to get cleaned up,&quot; Jess said as she ducked to avoid a 
wing. They were nearly as tall as Lane herself, and it was clear the 
woman didn&#39;t have much control over them.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Lane managed, sweat running down into her eyes, 
blood dripping down from her wings onto the floor.

        &quot;Come on,&quot; Jess took her over to the small shower attached to 
the tattoo parlor, helping her climb in. Lane was about to start the 
water when Jess nodded to the little panties, &quot;You might want to take 
those off first.&quot; With that she shut the shower door, a few moments 
later the panties fluttered over the door to land on the ground as the 
water started up.

        Jess made her way to her workroom, looking around with a frown. 
She rolled up the now blood splattered tarps off of the floor, bundling 
up the cloth and tying it up. A gesture put the candles out and she 
reached over to flip the light switch back on. She carefully made her 
way around, wiping up any remaining blood and mess from the ceremony.

        &quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; Jess said with satisfaction.

        There was a soft sound at the doorway, and Jess turned to see 
Lane standing there dressed in just her panties, smiling happy. Still 
damp from the shower the wings arched up on either side of her, almost 
glowing white in the light of the room. &quot;I never thought I would ever 
regain these,&quot; Lane said, reaching up to stoke a white wing delicately.

        &quot;If you hadn&#39;t once had them,&quot; Jess said simply, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t 
have even been possible.&quot;

        Lane closed her eyes a moment, &quot;It was so painful....&quot;

        &quot;Much like a birth,&quot; Jess agreed, &quot;and as necessary, I think.&quot; 
She smiled slightly, her eyes shining with a certain amount of pride, 
&quot;They look beautiful.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks to you,&quot; Lane agreed, walking over to where Jess stood. 
The scent of soap and shampoo swirled around her, her smile gentle as 
she looked up at the taller woman. &quot;You said you didn&#39;t want to acept 
money,&quot; she said softly, &quot;but could I...pay you back another way?&quot;

        Jess smiled down at Lane gently, taking the smaller woman by the 
shoulders. &quot;The chance to do something like this is payment enough,&quot; 
Jess said quietly. With a shrug of the shoulders she added, &quot;Not to 
mention there&#39;s someone I&#39;m seeing.&quot;

        &quot;Not because I&#39;m...?&quot; Lane made a gesture downward.

        &quot;You&#39;re lovely,&quot; Jess said to her simply. &quot;If I was interested 
in trying, I&#39;d call you first.&quot;

        Lane shushed her, stepping up to kiss her gently on the cheek. 
&quot;I will not forget what you have done for me, gallant one,&quot; she said, 
then walked over to collect her clothes that had been put aside in a 
neat little pile.

        &#39;Helping a transexual angel regain her wings,&#39; Jess thought to 
herself with a smile, &#39;This is something for the memoirs.&#39;

Author&#39;s Note: The idea of the wings coming forth so messily isn&#39;t my 
original idea, it&#39;s inspired by the first episode of an anime called 
Haibane Renmei. However, I&#39;ve taken the idea and tweaked it a bit, 
hopefully making for an interesting little story. </pre>
