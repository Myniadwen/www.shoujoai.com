&quot;Please tell me that is the last of them?&quot; Burnwell requested as he 
closed the door behind the Queen&#39;s massager, who made certain that the 
party did come to an end. The butler leaned against the door, weary from 
the night&#39;s endeavours.

Charles closed another door behind himself as he re-entered the main 
hall, &quot;I checked everywhere. There seems to be no one left aside from 
us.&quot; He proclaimed happily.

&quot;It is about time.&quot; Lilian remarked sipping another drink, &quot;I am glad 
that man left. His stares were getting unnerving.&quot; She stated with a 
shutter, and then looked at the scuffmarks on the floor and garbage all 
around, &quot;Father is not going to be pleased with this mess.&quot; She 
proclaimed.

Burnwell dropped into a chair against the wall, &quot;This is such a 
disaster. If I ever find out who told the Queen I will have their head.&quot; 
He said with a shake of his fist in fury.

Charles approached the man and stepped up to his side, &quot;Everything will 
find a way to work out. He said as he started to massage the back of the 
man&#39;s neck, &quot;You will see.&quot;

Burnwell batted the actor&#39;s hand away, &quot;Will you quit that?&quot; He demanded 
sternly. 

&quot;Yes, please.&quot; Lilian added while filling another drink, &quot;I do not need 
to see you two being lovey dovey around me.&quot; She remarked then emptied 
her glass in a single swallow, &quot;What would father think if he knew about 
the two of you?&quot; She asked pointing the glass at the two men. 

&quot;He will not know about us.&quot; Burnwell announced, &quot;Because there is no 
&#39;us&#39;.&quot; He stated in an irritated tone

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Charles inquired startled by the butler&#39;s sudden 
outburst, &quot;You promised me that we would be together forever.&quot; 

Burnwell stood to his feet and turned his angry eyes on the actor, &quot;That 
was before you stepped out of line. What was that you were doing with 
the Lord? I thought I told you not to speak unless I said you could?&quot; He 
declared angrily. 

&quot;I was just trying to help.&quot; Charles explained sheepishly, &quot;I did not 
think you would mind.&quot; 

&quot;You have helped too much.&quot; Burnwell vented in frustration, &quot;Get out and 
I do not want to see you around here again.&quot; He announced and pointed at 
the door. 

&quot;Now Burnwell.&quot; Lilian cooed as she crossed the room, &quot;Is that any way 
to treat an respected actor?&quot; She asked calmly.

&quot;I do not care any more.&quot; The butler announced angrily, &quot;I do not want 
to see his face ever again.&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot; Charles protested. 

&quot;No buts! OUT!&quot; Burnwell stomped his foot upon the ground with such 
force that even a few of the servants jumped.

Charles lowered his head and dragged his feet as he did as he was 
ordered. He only stopped for one last moment to get another look at the 
man he loved before opening the door and vanishing into the night. 

Lilian shook her head in distaste, &quot;Did you really need to do that?&quot; She 
asked, feeling sorry for Charles, &quot;It is not like he did anything wrong. 
He was only trying to be there for you.&quot;

Burnwell let out a distressed sigh, &quot;I know, my lady. I know. I just 
cannot deal with him right now.&quot; He rubbed his temple. 

&quot;Then why don&#39;t you go out for a breath of air while the other servants 
clean up this mess.&quot; Lilian suggested, giving the man a pat on the 
shoulder

&quot;You are a kind young lady, my lady.&quot; Burnwell touched Lilian&#39;s hand and 
took a deep breath, &quot;Maybe I will get some air.&quot; He turned to one of the 
maids; &quot;I want to see this room clean by the time I return, is that 
clear?&quot; He commanded. 

&quot;Yes Sir!&quot; The maid ran off to fetch some help. 

Burnwell nodded in satisfaction, he did enjoy being the head butler. 
When he was sure the other servants were busy cleaning up he headed to 
the back of the hall and through the doors to the main dinning area. At 
the back of the room he found a pair of double glass doors and stepped 
out into the garden. He took another deep breath, allowing the night air 
to fill his lungs and released it.

He scanned the area and he decided that a walk down by the lake was a 
suitable venture. He walked the many garden paths until he came across a 
wide sprawling lake. The pale moonlight glimmered off ripples on the 
water like stars upon its black surface. A smile played across the old 
butler&#39;s face as he realized how right Lilian was. The crisp air seemed 
to clear his mind and he was beginning to regret sending Charles away so 
quickly. It would have been nice to sit upon one of the benches along 
the lake and watch the stars with him. 

Burnwell drifted over thoughts and memories when something on the lake 
caught his eye. It was a tiny boat with a small round man, with no neck, 
in a suit and rather tall top hat standing near the stern. As the boat 
grew closer Burnwell noticed that the man was rather well dressed in his 
French cuffs, wing tipped collar and white gloves. He even has a long 
black cane with a crystal ball on the end gripped between his hands. The 
end of the cane was planted firmly planted between his feet and he did 
not seem to move as the boat drifted along. Peculiarly the butler 
watched as the man stood still as a statue, a bright smile upon his face 
and his eyes never leaving Burnwell.

&quot;Good evening my fellow man.&quot; The man suddenly came to life and called 
out across the lake at Burnwell, &quot;Would you perchance be able to give me 
a hand?&quot; He asked politely.

&quot;What are you doing out there, sir?&quot; Burnwell inquired taking in account 
that the man truly was alone on the boat.							

&quot;I was setting up camp for my circus when I got caught a drift.&quot; The man 
explained as he knelt over and picked up a bit of rope, &quot;Could you be so 
kind as to catch this and pull me ashore?&quot; 

&quot;Ummm... sure... one moment, sir...&quot; Burnwell ran down the embankment to 
the water&#39;s edge and prepared himself, &quot;Alright then!&quot; He called out. 

&quot;There you go!&quot; The little man tossed the rope high into the air causing 
the butler to have to stretch a bit to catch it. If it were not for his 
long arms, he might have fallen into the lake with the rope. Quickly, 
Burnwell pulled the tiny boat to shore and tied the rope to a tree, 
&quot;Thank you my good man.&quot; The mysterious man said with a hint of 
amusement in his tone.

Burnwell rushed to the side of the craft and helped the man to dry land, 
&quot;How long have you been adrift out there, sir?&quot; He asked taking a look 
in the boat to see it was empty, &quot;You seem to have no oars or anything.&quot; 

&quot;Not long.&quot; The man admitted stepping onto the shore, &quot;The current seems 
rather strong. I drifted right across the lake in no time.&quot; He gave a 
short chuckle, &quot;You can see my circus tent over there.&quot; He pointed with 
his cane across the waters at a set of bright lights that the butler was 
almost certain was not there a moment before, &quot;The name is Morbius 
Morbray, I am the ringmaster of the Morbray&#39;s Circus of Morbid 
Curiosities.&quot; He took a swift bow, then magically produced a ticket and 
handed it to the butler, &quot;A gift for your services. Free entrance to my 
circus if you wish, Mister...ummm... what was your name?&quot; He inquired 
pulling the tickets back just as Burnwell was about them.

&quot;Burnwell, sir.&quot; The butler stated, &quot;Victor Burnwell.&quot; He took his eyes 
off the ticket for a moment to look at the circus lights across the way 
again. He seemed to be in a daze and it felt as if the lights were 
calling out to him.

&quot;Well, Mr. Burnwell.&quot; Morbray gave the man another smile; &quot;Why don&#39;t you 
accompany me to the other side and I can show you all the wonders my 
world can offer.&quot; He held the ticket out to the butler once again who 
took it in his hand. The moment Burnwell had the ticket Morbray&#39;s face 
contorted into something sinister. The butler did not seem to notice 
this as he followed the ringmaster back into the boat and the two of 
them drifted back across the river.

Maria and her father tread along cliffs, high above the lake. They had 
been walking many of the winding paths through the forest, not saying so 
much as a word to each other. Each was awaiting the other to speak 
first. Slowly they approached a small peninsula that jutted out over the 
cliff and they stepped out to the edge to get a better look at the 
scenery below them. This was Maria&#39;s favourite spot to visit when the 
night skis where clear, like that very night. There were no trees 
anywhere near the cliffs edge so one could see all across the land. She 
ran out to the edge to look up upon the moon overhead wishing that Jamie 
could be by her side at that moment. Abruptly Lord Greystoke broke the 
silence. 

He took a deep unsettling breath and let it out, &quot;Maria, my child.&quot; He 
said while gazing up at the night sky with his hand crossed behind his 
back. His voice held a tone of disappointment that made Maria&#39;s spirits 
dwindle, &quot;I have been told of some rather unsettling news.&quot; 

&quot;What, father?&quot; Maria tried to hide the nervousness that had been 
building up inside of her since her father asked for her to come with 
him.

&quot;I do not like to listen to rumours from servants, however this 
information was rather upsetting to me.&quot; He stated with yet another sigh 
and a shake of his head as he closed his eyes and lowered his head. 

Maria&#39;s eyes darted about. Could it be that he had found out about 
Jamie&#39;s secret? Was he there when she bid Maria a good night? She was 
uncertain, &quot;You know the maids... They tend to make things up to keep 
themselves entertained.&quot; She declared finding it increasingly difficult 
to hide her anxiety. Her maid has not looked to please when she found 
the two of them making out on the couch. Could Anita have told on her? 
The maid was just an experiment when she was younger. She never thought 
the girl would become so vindictive. She nibbled on the inside of her 
lip trying hard to think of a way to explain things away if that was 
what he brought her out to talk about. 

&quot;Is that all it is?&quot; The Lord mused, &quot;They are saying you are seeing 
someone, a commoner boy. Is this true?&quot; He turned to set his old tired 
eyes on the girl; there was intense sadness in those eyes. Maria could 
tell that her father did not want to believe what he had heard; however 
it was understandable why he would be worried.  She had turned down 
every noble&#39;s invite to court her and the idea of her falling for a 
commoner would be rather distressing. He at the very least did not know 
about Jamie and she hoped that he never suspected her either

Maria let out a slight sigh of relief, &quot;Father, don&#39;t be silly.&quot; She 
gave the man a sincere smile, &quot;You know I&#39;m waiting for until the right 
noble to come along. Would you believe some servants over me?&quot; She 
asked, frightened of the answer that might follow.

The Lord also let out a sigh himself, &quot;I am glad to hear that. I trust 
your words. I just wanted to hear it from your lips was all.&quot;  He stated 
with a hearty laugh, &quot;I was told you were sleeping with the paperboy, 
Jamie. I figured it for just a simple rumour, however one of the maids 
was rather insistent about you taking the lad up to your room.&quot; He 
laughter echoed off the hills, &quot;To think, you and Jamie. That would be 
something else.&quot;

Maria forced herself to smile, &quot;The paperboy? He is so scrawny and 
dirty. Why would I spend time with him?&quot; She fibbed. Maria planned to 
have a word with Anita the moment she returned. The sound of rustling 
from the bushes startled her out of her thoughts, &quot;Who is there?&quot; She 
called out as she spun around to face her stalker. 

Greystoke turned around to see what had attracted his daughters 
attention, &quot;Is something the matter my dear?&quot; He asked searching the 
woods. Suddenly a pair of small shadows darted out from their hiding 
place. They both drove hard into the Lord and Young Lady causing the two 
of them to topple over the edge of the cliff and fall to the rocks 
below. With a giggle the shadows quickly faded into the woods without 
leaving a sign that they ever existed.
