<h1>Magic Star Warriors: The Dark Force Era (part 6 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/magstar-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>In the long stretch of road known as 3rd street, in the residence of 
the Kitana family, two star-crossed people have declared their love 
for each other. These two now have the chance to re-shape their lives. 
A chance to build a new future together. However, they also have a 
destiny. Their duty is to protect the earth from the scourge of the 
universe, the dark force. And this destiny is about to change with an 
event&#133;an event that was fated to occur from the dawn of creation&#133;

Inside Yai&#146;s house, Yai and Keiya were sitting the couch together. 
They had just kissed after saying how much they loved one and another. 
This surprised them both, as neither one had any clue that the other 
was in love with them (even though the signs were there). Although 
this was a joyous occasion, there were many problems facing them. 
Keiya wanted to talk things out; to make sure that Yai knew the 
obstacles, which would stand in their way, but the chestnut haired 
angel just wanted to stay in her love&#146;s arms. It had been so hard for 
Yai the past couple of days, and it took all of her willpower just to 
invite Keiya over, let alone tell her, her true feelings. Now that Yai 
knew that Keiya loved her, she just wanted to stay with her, to be 
near her. 

Yai was sitting next to Keiya, reveling in the closeness she had been 
denied for so long. Her head was resting on her Keiya&#146;s shoulder, and 
her hand held on to Keiya&#146;s. Suddenly however, Keiya spoke. 

&#147; Yai I just thought of something.&#148;   

&#147;What is it my love?&#148; Yai was still absent. She cherished this. 

&#147;&#133;Akira.&#148; She said blankly.

Yai frowned a little. She still felt a little guilty about that.

&#147;I broke up with him the day we were last attacked.&#148;

&#147;I thought &#133;you loved him&#133;&#148; Keiya trailed off.

Yai held Keiya&#146;s hand a little tighter. She could tell that the Lilac 
haired beauty was still worrying over this.

&#147;I did. I still do. As a friend. But I&#146;m in love with you.&#148;

Keiya smiled happily and looked at Yai, with a face full of love and 
innocence.

&#147;You don&#146;t know how good it makes me feel to here that.&#148;

&#147;I think I have a pretty good idea.&#148;

Yai pulled her head up from Keiya&#146;s shoulder and she turned her body 
towards her. Yai then faced her Keiya and took a second to observe 
her. Keiya was beautiful. With the grace, charm and image of an angel. 
How she was lucky enough to be able to hold her in her arms was 
something Yai would never know. Slowly Yai pulled towards Keiya and 
lightly brushed her lips against the Lilac haired starlet&#146;s. Keiya&#146;s 
hands traveled down Yai&#146;s body so she could pull her closer, deepening 
the kiss. They stayed like that for a while, exploring each other&#146;s 
bodies, enjoying what they had wanted for so long. Yai gently pulled 
away, and then leaned into Keiya&#146;s body, as she wrapped her arms 
around the Chestnut haired girl. Yai then decided to speak.

&#147;So&#133;who have you told?&#148;

Keiya looked confused &#147;Told? Told who? We just got together&#133;&#148;

&#147;I mean who have you told about your feelings for me.&#148;

&#147;I&#133;haven&#146;t told anyone.&#148;

&#147;Really? I have. I don&#146;t see how you can keep something like this a 
big secret.&#148;

&#147;You told someone?&#148; Keiya was thrown for a loop. She hadn&#146;t really 
thought about telling anyone just yet.

&#147;Well no need to sound so worried! I only told Alana and she&#146;s fine 
about it.&#148;

&#147;She is?&#148;

&#147;Yes, of course she is. Why is telling everyone such a big deal?&#148;

Keiya&#146;s face took on a serious note. Yai leaned up and looked at her 
again. Yai raised her hand and brushed away some stray strands of hair 
that had fallen down Keiya&#146;s face, and stroked her cheek with her 
thumb. Yai smiled a loving smile at Keiya.

&#147;Why shouldn&#146;t the world know how much I love you?&#148;

Keiya shuffled a bit. Yai obviously didn&#146;t understand.

&#147;Well, it&#146;s just that not all people are like that Yai. There are 
people out there who disagree with our love. They think it&#146;s wrong. I 
don&#146;t think you know how hard this with be on us.&#148;

Yai was a little annoyed. Not at Keiya, but at the idea that the love 
they shared was wrong. It wasn&#146;t. It was something pure, a force that 
cannot be denied. She knew this better than anyone; after all, she was 
the Goddess of love. Yai looked at Keiya firmly.

&#147;I don&#146;t care how others view us. I don&#146;t care what they think or say. 
As long as I am with you, I know I can survive anything.&#148;

Yai&#146;s position was firm, but not without love. She was an incredible 
person, Keiya always thought so. Yai was the kind of girl who could 
put a smile on your face even if you were at your lowest. Keiya smiled 
again and held Yai a little tighter. If she was only half as strong 
and determined as Yai was, she knew she could get through this. 

&#147;I love you, Yai.&#148;

&#147;I love you too, Keiya.&#148;

&#147;NO!!&#148;

Once again, in the statue filled halls of the negative dimension, the 
screams, cries and yells of the dark general Tanzanite can be heard 
echoing into the darkness.  Wong-Lao stood to the side, in human form, 
arms folded, leaning into the wall, listening to Tanzanite whine about 
the problems he was facing. Wong-Lao thought of Tanzanite as a whining 
idiot for acting this way, but within reason, he had a right to 
complain. Someone in his situation had every right to. The dark 
general had just gotten word that Plague, Poison and Virus had been 
killed. The insidious trio was no more. And the Starsoldiers three had 
been victorious. As he stalked up and down the down the marble floors, 
he had become more and more annoyed, and worried at that. They were 
his best chances at eliminating the Starsoldiers on earth, and they 
had been defeated. Wong-Lao himself was not surprised. He had seen 
first-hand, the kind of power that those warrior women possessed. 
Tanzanite kept pacing. This was infuriating. 

&#147;I can&#146;t believe this is happening to me. It is impossible. Poison, 
Plague and Virus were some of my best warriors. How could they be 
beaten? I need the other two talismans. If I don&#146;t get them, Asumasa 
will have my head. No, no, no! It&#146;s going all wrong!&#148;

Tanzanite grumbled to himself for second, then put a hand behind his 
back. He exhaled, and then brought out a card. Wong-Lao took a second 
to observe the card, the looked back up at Tanzanite.

&#147;Gargantua. You&#146;re going to summon Gargantua?&#148;  Wong-Lao said with 
blatant scepticism. 

&#147;Yes. I must. No warrior I have is stronger than he is.&#148;

&#147;What makes you think he&#146;ll listen to you?&#148;

&#147;Ha. Once I combine my Gargantua card with my Mind control card using 
the Dark chant, I will have his full allegiance.&#148;

&#147;Well I hope you know what you are doing. And if I were you, I&#146;d think 
about going down there and making sure that Gargantua fulfils his 
mission.&#148;

Tanzanite grimaced as he heard Wong-Lao say that. Although he would 
never admit it, he was afraid of going back to the planet and facing 
the starsoldiers. His shoulder still carried the scar from when 
Sunstar shot him with her Shining Sunset Beam attack. He had never 
before come into contact with Starsoldiers as powerful as these ones 
were. Then again, facing them now and dying is better than running 
away and living. Tanzanite ran a hand through his spiky jet-black hair 
and laughed contemptuously. 

&#147;You are right. I will go down there and oversee Gargantua&#146;s mission. 
Look after the Negative Dimension for me Wong-Lao. I should be back 
soon.&#148;

Tanzanite calmly walked forward as blinding light surrounded his body 
and in a flash, he teleported himself from the Negative Dimension. 
Wong-Lao looked at the marble floor where Tanzanite once stood. Some 
how he got the feeling that this would be the last time he would see 
the dark general&#133;alive. 

**********

2nd Street (Northern road) 8.30 am, Monday

Yai and Keiya were walking down 2nd street towards Keneda high school.  
They were together, hand in hand. There was not that many people 
around and Yai had no problem with it, but Keiya was still a little 
nervous about the whole thing. Neither one of them had ever been in 
this kind of relationship before, but Yai was so calm and cool about 
it. Like it was an everyday, normal thing. This really bothered Keiya, 
because it made her feel like she wasn&#146;t trying hard enough. But she 
really was. She wished she could be as confident about their 
relationship as Yai was, but she just couldn&#146;t do it. Most of this 
stemmed from her relationship with Hikaru. He was the one guy Keiya 
had ever dared to love, and look how that ended&#133; the fact was that she 
couldn&#146;t stand to have her heart broken again. Yai said she would 
stand by her firmly, but what if she actually was affected by any of 
the ridicule they were bound to face. What if Yai couldn&#146;t stand it 
any longer and she left her? What would happen then? Keiya tried to 
shake such thoughts out of her head. Yai would never hurt her like 
that. But still&#133;

Yai looked across the road, and saw someone walking towards them. 
Keiya looked at Yai questioningly, and then turned her head in the 
direction that Yai was facing. She saw a figure walking in their 
direction. Keiya felt worry infuse in her, and pulled away a little 
from Yai&#146;s hand. Yai looked at Keiya, gave her a warm smile to 
reassure her, and then tightened her grip softly. Keiya looked back at 
her. 

&#147;How can she be so calm and open about this? Oh Yai&#133;no. I&#146;ll do this. 
I&#146;ll be strong &#133;for you.&#148;

Keiya smiled back and squeezed Yai&#146;s hand. The chestnut haired girl&#146;s 
smile brightened as she turned back to see who it was that was walking 
towards them. To both their surprise it was&#133;

&#147;Alana!&#148;

Yai beamed. This was the one person who did know about them. Keiya was 
glad too when she saw Alana, and breathed out a sigh of relief. As 
Alana reached them, she saw the two of them holding hands, then looked 
back and forth between them, and smiled with a quiet joy. 

&#147;Should I have to ask what it is that you two did this weekend?&#148; Alana 
laughed happily 

&#147;Yeah. I invited Keiya over on Friday, made dinner for her, and 
somehow, we ended up confessing our feelings for each other. It was 
great. I had no idea that all this time she loved me as well, and 
after we talked for a little while, we found ourselves making out for 
the rest of the night&#133;&#148; Yai nudged at Keiya &#147;Right sweetie&#133;?&#148;

Keiya blushed deeply when Yai said that make out part, but she didn&#146;t 
say anything. She actually enjoyed that bit&#133;The Lilac haired starlet 
then coughed into her fist and turned to Alana. 

&#147;So&#133;Yai told you from before Alana?&#148;

&#147;Yes. I was actually doubtful about Yai&#146;s chances with you, but now 
that I see the two of you share the same feelings for each other, I am 
happy for you. For the both of you.&#148;

&#147;Thanks. It means a lot to me that you&#146;re happy with us being 
together. Thank you.&#148; Keiya smiled. It really did mean a lot to her.

&#147;Sure. You just do right by her! She&#146;s my best friend, you know?&#148;

Keiya faced Yai and grinned. &#147;Don&#146;t worry I intend to&#133;&#148; Keiya quickly 
kissed her chestnut haired angel. Yai pulled back and flashed her a 
wide grin.

&#147;That&#146;s the spirit Keiya! I knew you had the courage to kiss me in 
public! After all, if you&#146;re embarrassed by people seeing us kiss, 
what will you do when it comes to big things like when you announce 
our wedding?&#148;

Keiya and Alana face faulted at Yai&#146;s words.

&#147;W-wedding&#133;?&#148; Keiya stuttered. &#147;Don&#146;t you think you&#146;re jumping the gun 
a little?&#148;

Yai looked serious &#147;No. No way. I already have an eighteen page plan 
on when, where and how it&#146;ll happen. All you need to do is buy the 
most expensive engagement ring you can afford and propose to me.&#148;

Keiya sweat dropped and turned to stone. Marriage? They had only been 
going out for two days for Pete&#146;s sake! Keiya squinted and focussed on 
Yai&#146;s form when she nearly blacked out.

&#147;Yo? Earth to Keiya? Jeez, it was just a joke! I don&#146;t know if you 
know this but there is a new item on the market called a sense of 
humour. We really need to get you one&#133;&#148;

Keiya and Alana looked at each other, and then looked back at Yai who 
had an innocent smile on her face.

&#147;I guess it serves me right for falling in love with Neo-Tokyo&#146;s worst 
comedian.&#148; Keiya thought to herself.

**********

Half an hour later, Alana, Keiya and Yai made there way to Keneda high 
school. As they reached the front gate Alana said her goodbyes and 
when to her class. Yai and Keiya also made their way to class, and as 
usual good old Mr Hinoba was sealed away in a world of paper work and 
reports, blocking everything around him away. Yai sat down on her seat 
and exhaled.  Although she was happy that she and Keiya had found each 
other, more and more attacks were occurring and because of this, the 
tempo of Alana&#146;s training had been turned up a crack. Sometimes life 
had a habit of being so exhausting. Yai sat at her desk sleepily, 
until she observed Shingo walking through the door. She suddenly felt 
a wave of attentiveness sweep over her.  Yai&#146;s brow furrowed and her 
eyes narrowed as she watched him greet his friends in stride, then 
wave at Keiya. When Keiya waved back to Shingo, she turned her 
attentions back towards Yai, who was looking daggers at him. 

&#147;Damn&#133;if looks could kill&#133;&#148;

She had told Yai from the start that she felt nothing but friendship 
for Shingo, but Yai was still very threatened by him. It was pretty 
obvious that Shingo didn&#146;t get this, and he had made frequent attempts 
to go out with Keiya again, much to Yai&#146;s displeasure. She was 
actually more worried about Shingo then anyone else. Yai could snap 
him in two if given half the chance, &#145;Lovestar&#146; or not. Keeping the 
secret and keeping the peace was going to be hard&#133;

Shingo then walked over to Keiya and engaged in casual conversation. 
All through this, Keiya kept throwing pleading glances at Yai, who 
seemed to be watching the two of them with a rising annoyance. Yai 
stared at them while they were talking, watching Shingo&#146;s body 
language, every little move he made, and the way he would check out 
Keiya&#146;s body whilst she wasn&#146;t looking. Any idiot could see that this 
guy was crazy about her. Yai felt a burning jealously stir inside of 
her, and the only thing controlling her actions was the desire not to 
create a scene. Before her thoughts escaped her, she turned away. She 
really had nothing against Shingo, but the thought of him making moves 
on Keiya irritated her. The looks that he gave her&#133;she just didn&#146;t 
like it. Yai crossed her arms and slouched in her chair. 

&#147;I guess I shouldn&#146;t worry about it. I better learn how to cope with 
guys constantly chasing after her. She&#146;s been asked out more times in 
three weeks than I have in a year. Oh well. It&#146;s not like he can steal 
her away from me. She loves me. I wonder where Hisaka and Yumi are? I 
haven&#146;t seen them today. They are usually here before me. Hah, I bet 
they&#146;re faking the flu to spend time with Tetsura and Shinichi. I 
should try that with Keiya sometime.&#148;

As Yai drifted with her thoughts, Mr Hinoba stood and spoke.

&#147;Alright now class. I have reviewed your history exam results and I am 
pleased to say you all did quite well. The topics we have cover were 
rather extensive but you have shown me that you are capable enough to 
move on to bigger things. Now I have created a little work sheet to 
introduce you to our new subject. The Russian revolution.&#148;

The whole class groaned at Mr Hinoba&#146;s enthusiasm over such a boring 
subject. Yai turned away as Mr Hinoba got started. She really didn&#146;t 
have much patience for this sort of thing. Probably one of the reasons 
she needed Alana to Tutor her for a couple of weeks. As she rested her 
head on her slanted arm, she felt a twinge of darkness cross her 
heart. She raised upright and looked around in fear as she felt an 
evil aura descend over her. No. Not now. 

&#147;An attack? Now? Damn those guys have such great timing.&#148; Yai thought 
angrily. She looked towards Keiya, who seemed to be going through the 
same thing.

Perched atop of the northern block of Keneda high school, with his 
dark cape dancing in the mild breeze, stood the dark general 
Tanzanite. He frowned as he remembered this place. It was where 
Sunstar first injured him.

&#147;Blasted Starsoldiers&#133;this is the end for you.&#148; He mumbled

From out of his back he pulled out two cards. He threw them into the 
air and placed his hands together as they halted. He began to mumble 
the dark chant again, spouting word of an unknown language. The second 
card began to emit light, and sparks of electricity surrounded it. A 
thin beam of energy shot from the card and hit the other, which 
remained still. Suddenly the cards made a loud bang and a bright 
flash, and the two cards fused. As the light subsided, the form of a 
huge demon, surrounded by a thick, powerful aura showed it&#146;s self. As 
it&#146;s scarlet eyes opened, it mouthed its name.

&#147;Gargantua.&#148; It said huskily.

Tanzanite laughed evilly. This was his chance.

&#147;Now my minion, I want you to find the talisman in this human school. 
Leave no stone unturned and search everywhere&#133; Eventually, those vile 
Starsoldiers will arrive here. And when they do, I want you to destroy 
them! You hear me? Eliminate them! I want them all dead!&#148;

&#147;Yes sir.&#148; Gargantua responded

&#147;Ah, ha, ha, ha. You&#146;re as weak as we&#146;ve heard!&#148; 

Tanzanite heard a foreign voice call out to him. He didn&#146;t know who it 
was, but the insolence in her voice aggravated a mind already 
teetering on the border of insanity. He turned around abruptly as he 
heard her, and was more that surprised to see who it was that stood 
before him&#133;two girls&#133;

Tanzanite was astounded.

&#147;It&#146;s not possible&#133;it can&#146;t be&#133;&#148;

He looked at the two of them and studied them profusely. One of them 
was fairly tall for a girl, with dark, heavily banged hair, 
occasionally, brushing across her blasting, dark violet eyes. Her 
frame held a muscular femininity, a physically athletic form, yet 
graceful and poised.  Her well-built arms were crossed, and she was 
frowning, almost menacingly at the dark general and his soldier. The 
other was a little shorter, a much more feminine and youthful girl, 
rather lush in form, with graceful curves and a less disciplined 
disposition, but made her none the less threatening.  With a ponytail 
of red-hair quietly waving in the wind behind her, she beamed a 
devilish and shifty smile, fire dancing in her dark eyes&#133; She was 
obviously the one who had spoken to him, as she had the more pleased 
expression on her face. Suddenly the red headed one looked at her 
partner and spoke.

&#147;Well. It looks this guys is a little afraid. I guess I can&#146;t blame 
him. I&#146;d be frightened too if I were about to meet my maker.&#148;

&#147;Enough chatter. Hand over the talismans you have unless you want me 
to rip out you&#146;re spine.&#148; Said the taller girl.

Tanzanite was livid. 

&#147;Who are you&#133;!? You can&#146;t be&#133;&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; The taller girl interrupted &#147;We cant be what? I know exactly 
what you&#146;re thinking. But you are so wrong&#133;we are, and we want those 
Talismans. So you can either hand them over to me now, or I let my 
pyro-freak friend here roast you.&#148;

&#147;What did you call me?&#148; The red head piped up.

&#147;Not now&#133;&#148; said the taller, sweat dropping at her partner&#146;s 
forthrightness.  

Tanzanite watched them. They were so calm, but when around making 
death threats like that&#133;

&#147;Are they&#133;they cant be&#133;how can they be? It&#146;s not possible&#133;I already 
have three of them on my tail and now&#133;&#148;

Tanzanite&#146;s anger erupted. He was in no mood for pretenders.

&#147;Gargantua! You see these little girls over there? They are your 
quarry! Finish them!&#148;

The hulking beast moved in front of Tanzanite and he out an 
earth-shattering roar. His red eyes gleamed as he pounded his chest 
repeatedly. As he stopped he smiled at the two girls&#133;

&#147;Ya know, I think he meant that as a term of affection! Either that 
our friend here believes I&#146;m afraid of him!&#148; The redhead laughed. 

The dark haired girl grew angry. Very angry. &#147;This is you&#146;re last 
chance. Hand them over now or we&#146;ll dismember your little toy here and 
shove its remains down your throat!&#148;

Gargantua called out to her. &#147;You can&#146;t beat me&#133; now. I destroy 
you&#133;yes?&#148;

The dark haired girl sighed. Obviously this man was not going to back 
down without a fight. 

&#147;&#133;Do your thing Pyro.&#148;

The redhead cracked her knuckles. &#147;Ha! I thought you would never ask! 
Lets go you over grown lizard.&#148;

Gargantua screamed and charged at the over confident redhead. With one 
swift move he flung his fist at her. However, this cocky girl was 
cocky for a reason&#133;she caught his fist instantly before it reached 
her, mere centimetres away from her face.  Gargantua looked startled 
as he tried to shake his hand from a powerful grip. The redheaded girl 
smiled innocently as he tried in vain to struggle from her grasp. In a 
fit of rage her threw the other fist at the girl, but she again caught 
it a second time and laughed openly, mockingly.

&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha. What&#146;s wrong big guy? You seem a little ruffled.&#148;

The taller girl sighed as she watched this.

&#147;Damn that girl. She loves humiliating her opponents. It&#146;s like she 
forgets we have a mission&#133;&#148; 

The rage Gargantua began building was overflowing, as he struggled to 
free himself. Suddenly he felt his fingers intertwine with that of the 
redheads, and found himself in a commanding hand lock. The redhead 
grinned as she overpowered the mountain of muscle that was Gargantua. 
Gargantua then felt pressure on his arms and had to lower himself to 
one knee to even it out. Even so, the strength that the redhead 
emitted was too powerful, and full on.  The tall girl turned and 
looked on at Tanzanite, who was staring at this spectacle with 
disbelief.

&#147;Its not&#133;possible&#133;Gargantua is my strongest warrior&#133;how can he be 
overpowered by this girl? No&#133;it&#146;s not possible&#133;this cant be real.&#148;

The tall girl was losing her patience with Tanzanite. She didn&#146;t want 
to wait any longer.

&#147;You there. You seem a little pale in the face. Is it because my 
friend over there is about to kill your minion? Or is it because there 
is nothing you can do to beat us? Do you wish to make it simple&#133;? Hand 
over the Talismans.&#148;

 Tanzanite looked at the girl with shock. There was only one 
option&#133;only one&#133;

&#147;Gargantua! Lets go! Now!&#148; Yelled the dark general.

The taller girls anger was evident. &#147;What!?&#148;

&#147;Shining Sunset Beam!&#148;

Suddenly a thin shot of energy pierced the floor to grab the attention 
of everyone. The tall girl, the redhead, Tanzanite and Gargantua 
turned to the place from which the blast came. They all looked towards 
the door of the stairs and saw Sunstar, the Goddess of Knowledge. 

&#147;You are the one they call Tanzanite! Did you not learn your lesson 
beforehand? What are you doing here?&#148;

Tanzanite stepped back in fear&#133;it was Sunstar&#133;the one who shot a hole 
through his shoulder&#133;

&#147;Gargantua!!! Lets go!!!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll be back&#133;&#148; the titan of muscle murmured as he teleported 
alongside Tanzanite. In a flash, the two were gone. The taller one and 
the redheaded one stepped forward and faced Sunstar, who still hand 
her arm set in firing position.

&#147;Who are you?&#148; the taller called out &#147;You are a magic star soldier are 
you not? What are you doing here&#133;?&#148;

&#147;My exact question to you&#133;&#148; Sunstar replied

The taller girl smiled &#147;We&#146;ll meet again&#133;lets go Pyro.&#148;

The redhead frowned &#147;how many times do I have to tell you, don&#146;t call 
me that!&#148;

 The Dark-haired girl shook her head. &#147;Whatever. We shall see you 
again blonde one.&#148;

After a swift leap the two were gone. As Sunstar&#146;s braided hair blew 
in the breeze, she asked herself a new question&#133;

&#147;Is it possible that there are two new Starsoldiers?&#148;
