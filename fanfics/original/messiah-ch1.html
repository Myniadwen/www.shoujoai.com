<h1>The Messiah Series (part 1 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Date Begun: 15th August 2005
Date Ended: Ongoing 
Genre: Action/Romance/Angst
Albums listened to during the making of this fiction: Shadow Hearts 2 
Soundtrack, Ixnay on the Hombre/Americana/Ignition (Offspring), 
Facelift/Jar of Flies (Alice in Chains), Wiseblood (Corrosion of 
Conformity), Dutty Rock (Sean Paul), etc. 

Author&#39;s Notes: The Messiah Series is the third collaboration between 
Kaiser, Christine and Shadow Bunny. And it&#39;s by far the most significant 
of them all. We all agreed that we wanted something hard and gritty in a 
Anime-flavoured light, something to break away from the soft heroism of 
Last Saga 4 and the simplicity of Circle of One. And this is the end 
result. A story of over 48,000 words. Though we had only planned to make 
it a 20,000 word story, we slogged our guts out and it ended up being 
twice as long. Messiah was originally intended with hand-to-hand battles 
rather than mecha ones. But after an entire week of watching Gundam 
Wing, Gasaraki and Neon Genesis Evangelion (as well as playing Xenogears 
for the first time ever), I convinced Christine and Shadow Bunny to let 
this be a giant robo fiction. In the end it came out as a sort of angsty 
action/light romance story with a particular flavour to it (sort of like 
Xenogears meets Serial Experiments Lain meets RahXephon). So read and 
see what you think. Be warned from now though. This story has a 
selectively mature outlook and detail. It contains violence (physical, 
emotional, psychological and sexual) as well as quotes from the Bible 
and romantic/sexual engagements between women and other women (once 
again I managed to convince Shadow Bunny to hold off on the guy/guy 
stuff... somehow). If any of those ideas put you off then I suggest you 
stay away from Messiah. If you&#39;re mature enough to handle it then read 
onwards. This story can also get a bet complicated and detailed if you 
don&#39;t follow it properly, so to spare some confusion I added an FAQ at 
the end of chapter 15. But if you don&#39;t want to spoil any of the plot 
twists then I suggest you save it till you read every chapter. 

Okay then. The characters &#39;Terry&#39;, &#39;Sophia&#39;, &#39;Rain&#39; and &#39;Edwina&#39; and the 
Meta Suit &#39;Diablos&#39; are the creations and property of Shadow Bunny. The 
characters &#39;Celaph&#39;, &#39;Leena&#39; and &#39;Selena&#39; are the creation and property 
of Christine. All other characters and Meta Suits are the creations and 
property of Kaiser. The three authors of this story reserve joint 
ownership of it. 

If you have any comments (and you&#39;ve read this from a site that doesn&#39;t 
have review capabilities) then you can send them to

Okay then! On with the show!

Chronicle One - because her name is &#39;Yumi Mishima&#39; 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Light pattered through a gap between two curtains that had not been 
opened very often. That light traced itself as a beam across the 
carpeted floor of Yumi&#39;s bedroom. Rolling all the way over to her 
pristinely re-made bed. Of course she herself was not sleeping. In fact, 
that in itself was a task without a steady supply of sleeping pills. But 
the treatments her doctor had been giving her would have suggested 
otherwise. Which was why he cut Yumi off of them.  The time had come for 
her to &#39;work out her insomnia without the use of drugs&#39;. 

If she had parents, they probably would have agreed with him. 

But Yumi couldn&#39;t see it that way. And she never would. Which probably 
meant that she would be this tired for the rest of her life. The door to 
the young woman&#39;s bedroom (adorned with posters that had been dedicated 
to her favourite band, Suicide of Claire) opened. And Yumi walked back 
into the room with a steaming mug of coffee in her hand. She took one 
sip of it, even though coffee wasn&#39;t the best choice of beverage for a 
confirmed insomniac, and then sat down on the swivelling chair aside her 
computer. Yumi put down the coffee mug and sighed, placing her fingers 
to her keyboard. The scene she had left on her monitor came back to life 
with the end of the screen saver. A window popped up showing the 
conformation of the save of the very same thing she had spent nearly 230 
hours downloading. Yumi&#39;s light frown didn&#39;t leave her face. But her 
emotions, quiet as they normally were, leapt at the thought of finally 
having downloaded it. Trigger Mode 890. The newest software in the field 
of AWG (Artificial World Generation). The known concept of Virtual 
Reality had grown much in recent years. No thanks in part to the 
technological heads of Protocol. The idea of forging your own virtual 
world and living it through with the brain visor was a dream come true 
for many. After all, such tech was not even in proper circulation to the 
public yet. But for someone like Yumi, with the hacking skills of a 
demon, it was a matter of find and take. Downloading this illegally 
would get her in trouble if she didn&#39;t watch herself. 

If she had a significant other, he or she probably would have been 
concerned by the idea. 

But Yumi was too good for that. To get the software she had to buy a 
neo-broadband modem, one that would run for the amount of time 
specified. Then she had to hack into the system of the Protocol 
mega-database, break (or rather bend) its numerous firewalls, and then 
download. Of course she couldn&#39;t just rely on that for 200+ hours. The 
Protocol Database was a stringent user of &#39;Security Demons&#39;. Which were 
basically randomly coded security programs to detect criminal activity 
in the server. They &#39;re-spawned&#39; every two and a half days, always with 
a newer code for Yumi to deal with. But as said, she was no amateur in 
that field. Security Demons had a bonus in the fact that they changed 
constantly so they had no solid and consistent method of deletion. But 
because of their randomly generated codes, Security Demons weren&#39;t 
always very detailed. Thus they couldn&#39;t often detect the more secretive 
actions of hackers. And more importantly, Yumi had a program of her own 
to deal with the Security Demons. Her own invention. Something she liked 
to refer to as a &#39;Counter Demon Wall&#39;. With use of that she could hide 
her downloading of Trigger Mode from the Security Demons. 

The end result of that was this. Yumi took a blank CD from her drawer 
and opened the case. And then slotted the CD inside her C-Drive for the 
copying. In no time at all she saved the Trigger Mode software onto the 
CD, and then broke her links with the Protocol database. She was a 
daring hacker, but she wasn&#39;t stupid. You didn&#39;t wanna fuck around with 
an organization that controlled the world for too long. Skill may have 
been one of Yumi&#39;s strong points, but arrogance was not. Once she 
successfully saved the software to the CD, she breathed a sigh of relief 
and grabbed her mug of coffee. The eighteen-year-old took a sip and then 
relaxed peacefully. Now that her connections with the database were 
over, she could rest more easily. It was a dangerous business, hacking 
in the 22nd Century. Even more so when the hacker messed with a global 
force like that Protocol. This year of 2153 had seen the rise of the 
organization. The force that was once the UN had subsided to it long 
ago. It was both a scientific and political organization that acted as 
the world&#39;s first global, non-unilateral government. A representative 
from every country was  sent to join a group known as the Upper Council. 
That group was the highest known authority in the world. They decided on 
many things for all countries in the world, or at least the parts that 
were under Protocol&#39;s jurisdiction. When it came to things like 
agriculture and military force, Protocol&#39;s heavy influence controlled 
everything.   

Yumi leaned back on her chair, thinking about Protocol. It seemed a 
little unbelievable, even in this day and age, that a political faction 
like Protocol could exist. Especially one based on a theocracy. The 
world government was as religious as it was political. Often talking of 
the &#39;end of the world&#39; and on &#39;human redemption&#39;. Of course, Yumi was an 
embittered atheist so she didn&#39;t really know much else about the 
religious aspect of Protocol. Thankfully the group never really 
attempted to force their theocracy on anyone. Even at college, the 
learning of Protocol&#39;s religion, Messiahism, was a completely optional 
lesson. They had learned from the mistakes of previous eras, it seemed. 
Besides. Those living the good life in the world felt... indebted to 
Protocol. 

Because, in some respects, they had restarted the world. 

But rather than dwell on any thoughts of a war that took place nearly 
148 years ago, the Japanese girl sipped the last of her coffee and stood 
upright, stretching out her arms. The girl then strode up to the 
curtains of the windows and pulled them open. She didn&#39;t like opening 
the curtains of her apartment much. Mostly because she wanted her 
privacy, partly because she preferred it dark in her rooms. It was an 
addition to a not necessarily gloomy decor, but it suited Yumi in the 
way she felt about things. 

If she had friends, it might have bothered them.

Yumi was a lonely girl. 

And there were only two things in her life that made it worthwhile. Her 
exploits as a hacker, and her... other. The closest thing that she had 
ever had to a friend. The woman known as Chizuru Matsubana. Even now, 
Yumi could feel her cheeks flowering at the thought of her. Chizuru was 
no ordinary woman, that was for sure. But those beautiful yet lofty 
fair-weather dreams were all she would ever get from the woman. Such 
thoughts further served the Mishima girl&#39;s depression. Yumi sighed once 
more then opened the two windows of her room. Allowing all new fresh air 
to seep in. Whilst looking outwardly into the wonders of the place known 
as Meta Tokyo. A regally grand and bustling offspring of its former 
self. The towering skyscrapers of Neo-Shinjuku could be seen as far away 
as Yumi&#39;s residential district. That was the centre of business when it 
came to Japan. And also the centre of the scientific/technological 
world. All twenty of the Japanese research stations of Protocol were 
stationed around Neo-Shinjuku. And when she looked down to the street 
she could see sweeper androids clearing up the rubbish left in the roads 
by the biological half of the city. Androids were an important part of 
life in this time. The world population was at least 42% lower than what 
it had been 148 years ago. Thus there was that little bastard issue 
called labour shortage for the world to suffer with. Around the time 
that Protocol had risen, the field of AI had seen massive growth. Mostly 
because scientists remaining from the Great War had to push up the speed 
of android development to quell the labour shortage. But also because 
the Great War had shown people just how much they resented participating 
in warfare. Conscription had been one of the tyrants of that particular 
war. Eventually the Protocol group made the jump into android tech. Now, 
more than a century later, androids were as commonplace as sex.

Once Yumi breathed in the freshness of the air that she didn&#39;t often 
admire, there was a subtle chime from the speakers of her computer. A 
bell that indicated that she had a new e-mail. That was strange. When 
she started up her computer, none of her contacts had been online. Yumi 
walked over to her desk and sat down once again to see what it was. She 
placed her hand over her mouse and brought the cursor to an open window 
of her explorer. She clicked on the address bar and then typed in the 
location of chosen e-mail account. The window switched to that same 
site, and the white-haired teen clicked on the icon that held her 
e-mail. Her inbox then appeared. In which she saw the e-mail. Addressed 
to her from someone under the title of &#39;anonymous&#39;. The heading of the 
e-mail said nothing more than &#39;Yumi&#39;.

She stared at it for a moment. It wasn&#39;t junk, her account would have 
deleted it if it was. So who was it from? She wasted absolutely no time 
pondering on that and opened the e-mail. When the window adjusted itself 
she read out the text of it, reciting, &quot;Yumi Mishima. The world is 
subject to a constant cycle of Assimilation, Process and Reaction. The 
engine of the universe to which all things -- biological and 
technological -- are based. At the beginning of the time of the  Seven 
Keys such distinctions were completely foreign to us. As was the concept 
of &#39;distinction&#39;. If all is as destiny plans, that time will come again. 
You can remain as you are no longer.&quot;

End of the e-mail.

Yumi blinked. &quot;What is this? Some kind of riddle?&quot;

No matter was this thing actually was, Yumi knew that she couldn&#39;t 
understand a word of it. In her mindset she just ignored the content and 
focused on the more glaring fact. Whatever moron sent this e-mail, he or 
she knew her name. Her real name. The only person that knew Yumi&#39;s 
e-mail address in the real world was Chizuru. And she wasn&#39;t much of a 
techno-buff in any sort of way. So who was it from? And just how... did 
they know Yumi&#39;s real name?

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

In this world, the importance of the military was known to all. Not 
always as a method of destruction. But as a deterrent of it. That was 
the sentiment that Protocol pushed to separate themselves from the image 
of them as a bunch of unified despots. An image that was frequently 
being shown in the media force of the internet. But there was no 
separation between Protocol and military force. And in the centre of 
Meta-Tokyo, the heartland known as Neo-Shinjuku, the central station of 
the Japanese division of Protocol&#39;s military power existed. 

Protocol&#39;s army had many bases across the world. This was only one of 
them. It was called the Shinrai Complex. A gigantic hexagonal building 
fenced off by nothing more than four long stone walls. Surrounded by a 
layer of grass and trees that sought, in design, to brighten the layout 
of the facility. It was bordered by the business skyscrapers of 
Neo-Shinjuku, dwarfed in height but not influence. In fact, even the 
grassy grounds around the walls of the building were  off limits to 
unauthorized members of the public. In terms of firepower in reserve, 
the Shinrai Complex was the biggest non-armed military base in the 
world, under a square distance of 300 metres by another 345 metres, 
which included both building and layout. It was more a centre for admin 
and direction to the lesser, more-heavily armed bases around Japan. In 
fact the Shinrai Complex possessed only a few hangers for mobile 
weaponry in means of defence. But what it did have was a huge 
underground research facility, which connected to many tunnels 
underneath the city of Meta-Tokyo. One stretched all the way to 
Meta-Tokyo Bay as the primary escape route. The importance of this base 
to the web of military bases across the country was undeniable. Because 
this was the centre point of it all. Which made it easier to understand 
why the Divine Blade, the division of the Holy Protocol Army (which made 
total use of the weapons known as Meta Suits) was stationed primarily at 
the Shinrai Complex. 

In the upper levels of this administrative building was a certain 
office. A richly designed one. It had a desk, and a computer and a large 
window for much light to peer through, naturally. But it also had 
trophies. Along the walls were armaments from bygone eras. The matchlock 
rifles that had been a staple Japanese firearm until the 1800&#39;s. The 
katanas and naginatas that this nation had been famous for. As well as 
pistols, axes, German Zweihander swords and spears. All mounted on the 
walls of that particular office. The reflection of a certain man&#39;s 
dreams, his fascination with the art of warfare. And that of his heart, 
a warrior&#39;s heart chilled by the taint of that which his superiors 
called peace. There was no greater pain than for a soldier to suffer the 
lust for conflict in a world of peace created as a result of conflict. 
That man, the one who suffered that same pain, was standing by the 
bright light of that large office window. 

That man&#39;s name was William Ank Celaph. 

In the Shinrai Complex, he was referred to as Commander Celaph. He was 
not a Japanese national. No, he was born far to the west, in England. 
But after the much publicized terrorist attacks on Meta-Tokyo&#39;s ports 
three months ago, the previous commander of the Japanese division of the 
Holy Protocol Army had &#39;abdicated&#39; his post in a rather swift way. It 
came to the point where the Japanese military truly needed a new, 
charismatic and talented leader. And thus they had sent for William Ank 
Celaph. The man famed for his many successful string of victories 
against the rebels outside of the Meta Cities. Celaph looked out to the 
window to the scene of the many car-packed roads outside of the Shinrai 
Complex. The man of little more than twenty-nine-years brushed his 
blonde bangs out of his eye line, smiling unhappily. Meta-London was his 
home. But this would do for now. Across from Celaph, on his desk, the 
intercom went off. And his secretary, Mitsuko, called to him, 
announcing,

&quot;Commander Celaph, you have been contacted.&quot;

&quot;It must be the Triad of the Inquisition,&quot; He whispered, &quot;please put it 
through, Mitsuko.&quot;

The girl made a confirming noise and did just that. Above the desk, in 
the ceiling, was a compartment. The doors to that compartment separated 
and opened to reveal a video screen. The mechanical gears and pulleys 
holding it up shifted the screen down slowly, so that the screen came 
into a vertical position to be seen. Then the screen turned itself on. 
An image of three shadowed figures, each bathed in darkness but glowing 
with their own individual aura stood silently. Celaph turned around and 
fell to one knee in esteem. It was truly a great honour. One that was 
not new to him but very important. 

&quot;It is good to see you all once again, great sirs.&quot; He exclaimed. 

One of the three holy men, known forever more as the Triad of the 
Inquisition, spoke to Celaph with his biologically morphed voice box 
pouring out a seething and oily voice. &quot;Commander Celaph. The time we 
have prepared for all this time, is finally upon us.&quot;

Celaph&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Do you actually mean to say... that the rebirth 
is finally at hand...?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; One other replied, &quot;...the reunion of Eros and the Thanatos to 
the birth of the Greater One. A Novus Deus after all our waiting. The 
time has come. Which means that nothing can interrupt the process.&quot;

Celaph stood back up. &quot;I see. Is that why you had me stationed in Japan? 
To oversee the reunion?&quot;

&quot;No. We actually felt that your talents would be better issued to the 
destruction of the rebels. We have great reason to believe that 
Chrysalis is now operating out of Meta-Tokyo. They must be stopped once 
and for all.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; The commander mused on the idea, &quot;I see. Defeating them would 
more or less leave EDEN defenceless. Do you wish me to mobilize the 
Divine Blade for that mission? General Naam is a rather difficult man to 
control...but... his skills in piloting Meta Suits are almost flawless. 
The only one who surpasses them... is...&quot;

&quot;Deploy the Divine Blade,&quot; One of the three answered, &quot;Naam shall lead 
them into battle. You shall formulate their pattern of attack. Now. How 
is that one?&quot; 

&quot;You mean the Thanatos? He is a... pistol. His recklessness knows no 
bounds. But then... that recklessness is a result of that amazing tank 
of energy he possesses. I&#39;ve come to believe his significance. I just 
don&#39;t see putting him into battle conditions as a good idea as yet. The 
Raum Meta Suit is ready for him... but... I do not think that his mind 
is rational enough to follow orders on the battlefield.&quot;

The second of the Triad of the Inquisition addressed that. &quot;Contact 
between the Eros and the Thanatos is not pivotal at this point. If he is 
not ready then send him to Ix Nos Babel for the time being. For now, you 
will focus your efforts on suppressing the insurgence of those following 
under the banner of Bartholomeus. You are familiar with his 
granddaughter, are you not?&quot;

Celaph smiled solemnly. &quot;We knew each other... once.&quot;

&quot;Then no one is better suited to this operation than you, Celaph. The 
completion of both the Oriax and the Raum Meta Suits is just the first 
step in the plan. Use of them... might be necessary.&quot;

&quot;Is Chrysalis that powerful? Have we been underestimating the Ark of the 
Luria? Or do you have a different reason for this?&quot;

The middle of the Triad shook his head. &quot;...You needn&#39;t concern yourself 
with that, Celaph. The important thing now is to secure the event to 
come. By destroying those who would interfere with it. That should be 
your primary concern.&quot;

That was enough for Celaph. &quot;Fair enough. But then what of Eros? Should 
we make sure that one is secured as well? Transportation to Ix Nos Babel 
would not take long.&quot;

&quot;We will handle that end,&quot; One of them replied to the English  
commander, &quot;you just concentrate on the rebels. If something should 
happen in that respect, then, all issues concerned will be handed to 
you, Celaph. Do you understand?&quot;

The Englishman nodded. &quot;Yes, sirs. I understand. So. It&#39;s finally 
happening. The reversal of the events of the Seven Keys is finally at 
hand. One can&#39;t help but be... excited.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

It had been an hour or so since Yumi had downloaded the Trigger Mode 
software from the Protocol mainframe. College had been out for the 
summer for the past three weeks. She still had plenty of time before she 
had to get to work on any of her mid-summer projects. It didn&#39;t much 
matter to Yumi; most schoolwork of her own she did with great ease. It 
was never really a challenge. But it was never an annoyance either.  
Putting it off was a matter of convenience. Not for Yumi herself, but 
rather for Chizuru. Who was the person that Yumi was going to meet 
today. 

The white-haired teen had dressed in the best clothes she afforded for 
herself because of her meeting with Chizuru today. A beige brown set of 
shorts and a white top, one which had the phrase &#39;bad girl&#39; on the back. 
Yumi looked down silently and waited for Chizuru to make her appearance. 
They had agreed to meet just outside of Yumi&#39;s apartment. On a side road 
just ten metres down from the door to Yumi&#39;s building. She stood leaning 
against the north wall of a bakery, smelling pleasantly the fragrance of 
freshly cooked bread. One of her club heel sandals tapped the other 
whilst waiting. She didn&#39;t mind waiting for Chizuru, even though there 
were times when she could become impatient. But seeing Chizuru in the 
flesh was a telling reason for her current patience all of itself. There 
were few women in this world or the next that were quite so beautiful. 

Then she heard the phrase &#39;what&#39;s up, Yumi?&#39; from a short distance 
across the road. Yumi&#39;s bright baby blue eyes blinked and she looked 
upwards from her feet. Her normal frown was now replaced with a small 
but heartfelt smile. And that all came from seeing that same girl of her 
dreams. Chizuru Matsubana. Yumi&#39;s cheeks automatically blushed. Just 
from being aware of the girl&#39;s presence. Never before and perhaps never 
again would Yumi be so attracted to a single person. The hacker dared or 
willed herself to look at Chizuru. To look at her long, flawless locks 
of raven black hair, inching all the way down to the crests of her small 
and tight rear end. She forced herself to admire Chizuru&#39;s long flawless 
legs, in their delicate yet athletic posture, and her healthy bouncing 
breasts. What Yumi felt was no more than sheer human attraction at this 
point. But she wasn&#39;t the kind to circumnavigate the reasons for and 
against it. All she was aware of was the beauty of the Matsubana girl. 
So much so that it caused a reaction in Chizuru herself. The long-haired 
female smirked playfully when she came up to the silent Yumi. Chizuru 
then pulled her hand out of her jeans pocket and pressed it against 
Yumi&#39;s forehead, analysing something.

&quot;Have you had too much sun?&quot; She asked rhetorically, &quot;cause if you have, 
maybe we shouldn&#39;t be going out together?&quot;

Yumi blinked, shaking herself out of her reverie. &quot;...Um... no.&quot;

&quot;Well then you can stop staring, Yumi,&quot; Chizuru said with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m 
not that ugly am I? Or is it the opposite?&quot;

Given that Yumi had not ONCE spoken of her feelings (physical) to 
anyone, least of all to Chizuru, it should have struck her alarm bells 
to hear such a comment from the dark-haired woman. But she was far too 
caught up in the sweet, sweet beauty of Chizuru. They were not friends. 
Never once had they called themselves as such. But what they had was a 
shared interest in each other. Yumi was near enough bewitched by 
Chizuru&#39;s beauty. Enough to follow her even into the fiery pits of hell. 
And Chizuru had her own reasons for being around the hacker from time to 
time. She had never specified them. But rather Chizuru had a habit of 
using harmless flirtation to avoid the subject whenever it was brought 
up. 

Times came when Yumi questioned why Chizuru, one of the most popular 
girls at college, would even bother associating herself with one of 
college&#39;s dregs. 

Now was such a time. &quot;...W-why... did you ask to meet me?&quot;

Chizuru&#39;s face went still for a brief moment. Then she pulled a wide 
smile at her current companion. &quot;What kind of question is that, huh? Do 
I really need a reason?&quot;

&quot;I suppose not.&quot; Yumi admitted. 

&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Chizuru tugged a strand of her hair backwards to her ear 
and then said, &quot;I do have an ulterior motive. I need you to do me a 
REALLY big favour. Could you do it for me, Yumi?&quot;

&quot;That depends on what it is.&quot;

&quot;I need you to change something,&quot; The darker haired teen went into the 
back pocket of her jeans, ones which, Yumi noticed, hugged very closely 
to the globes of her ass. Still Chizuru pulled out something. It was an 
ID card, &quot;Could you alter this for me?&quot;

Yumi took the plastic card in her hand and looked it over. &quot;Is that all 
you need me to do?&quot;

&quot;Well, I was hoping, if you&#39;re not too busy with your gloomy anti-social 
life, if you&#39;d agree to come see a movie with me? I just need you to 
tamper with that card a little so that it says I&#39;m 21 rather than 18. 
You&#39;d have to do that with your card too if you wanna come.&quot;

The Mishima girl blinked, astounded. &quot;You... actually... want to... hang 
out with me...?&quot;

&quot;Well duh! I just said so, didn&#39;t I? Don&#39;t act so surprised. You&#39;ve done 
a lot for me since we met during the first term. I guess this is the 
least I can do for you.&quot;

It was then that Yumi&#39;s sudden peak of happiness mellowed out. So 
Chizuru only thought of it as an obligation. A way to repay favours. No 
matter what way Chizuru acted, she still couldn&#39;t see that Yumi felt 
something for her. It was understandable in a ridiculous way. She was a 
typical trendy bimbo in most cases. The only reason she had passed the 
flawlessly difficult entry exams into Meta-Tokyo was because she majored 
in Drama, which couldn&#39;t really be evaluated that way. And since they 
had met... all that existed between them was a system of want help and 
take help. Chizuru needed help on a certain homework problem from one of 
her secondary classes? Yumi was there for her. If ever she needed a 
written essay typed up on a computer then Yumi was the one to pull the 
all-nighter. You could have said that Chizuru was... taking advantage of 
Yumi. And you would have been right. But that little detail didn&#39;t 
really matter... to either of them. Yumi was too caught up in Chizuru&#39;s 
beauty. And young Chizuru was too caught up in herself.

...Or so it seemed. 

Yumi nodded as an acceptance of what Chizuru wanted. Chizuru replied 
with a loud and childish giggle. But if they were going to get into 
whichever movie that the taller girl wanted to see, then they would have 
to get back up to Yumi&#39;s apartment. ID cards were laminated but she had 
a device to change that. The two of them turned around to head back 
around to Yumi&#39;s apartment. But then when they did, they noted that two 
men, both dressed in dark black business suits, were waiting before the 
stoop of Yumi&#39;s apartment building. Both girls became cautious. It was a 
quiet area that Yumi lived in. These men seemed somehow out of place. 
And the focused smiles on their faces showed that they had an agenda. 
Chizuru huddled closer to Yumi while the pair of them walked over to the 
stoop. But before Yumi even set foot on it, one of them stepped ahead, 
stopping her. 

He pulled a smirk, lowering his shades with his fingertips. &quot;Would you 
happen to be a woman by the name of Yumi Mishima?&quot;

A cold and blunt fear suddenly crept up Yumi&#39;s spine. What if this had 
something to do with her illegal downloads from the Protocol mainframe? 
&quot;...W-why do you want to know t-that?&quot;

&quot;Just answer the question,&quot; The second man barked, &quot;are you Yumi 
Mishima?&quot;

&quot;Look, we don&#39;t want any trouble,&quot; Chizuru said hopefully, &quot;can you just 
let us go this time?&quot;

The first of the suits laughed derisively. &quot;This kid thinks that we&#39;re 
with Meta-Tokyo&#39;s constabulary. Hmph. That&#39;s rich. Broads really are 
stupider than they look. Hey there kid, d&#39;you get that from your mom? 
All tits and no brains?&quot;

The sparkling twinkle of anger shot through Chizuru&#39;s eyes in all but a 
flash, however she didn&#39;t act on it. Before she even would have had that 
chance, Yumi stepped ahead of Chizuru and hid the other girl&#39;s ID card. 
&quot;Please leave us alone. If you&#39;re not the police, then-&quot;

The second man growled, and then thrust his fist out. Yumi gasped as he 
grabbed her by the throat, so quickly that she barely caught onto it. 
The taller male sniggered rudely at her face. Watching her cheeks redden 
with the sudden lack of oxygen from the throat. His grip around her neck 
tightened, causing her to writhe, gag, and claw at his thick, muscled 
hand to stop. But he wasn&#39;t stopping. And it became clear that he had no 
intentions to do so, either. 

&quot;You&#39;re coming with us... Yumi Mishima...&quot;

This time Chizuru&#39;s frown was here to stay. &quot;Hey! Let her go!&quot;

Chizuru tried to get to Yumi before she choked, but the first of the 
suits stepped ahead of her, blocking her pass. He then tugged a grin and 
drew his hand up. Each of his fingers curled up into the palm, to form a 
fist. Then he smacked Chizuru across the face in one hard but controlled 
punch. Chizuru yelped and fell backwards, collapsing to the ground, her 
cheek bruising a dark purple. Yumi&#39;s eyes widened with alarm, catching 
sight of that. But no more so than when the tall business suit-dressed 
man stamped his scuffed black shoe into Chizuru&#39;s face, as she lay prone 
over the pavement. &quot;Little bitch. Got something to say now?&quot;

-- ASSIMILATION -- 

Yumi tried to yell at him to stop. She tried. But she could hardly part 
her lips. And it seemed that with each second that passed, the grip of 
the second man was growing tighter. Soon her feet began to rise up off 
the ground, her sandals clicking against the pavement. This man was 
strong enough to lift the teen right off her feet with just one hand. 
Which meant that he was at least using muscle enhancements. Which also 
meant that he was working for Protocol. Only they had that kind of 
performance-enhancing therapy. But Yumi&#39;s concern was never for herself. 
All she did was stare powerlessly at Chizuru. Watching that man step on 
her beautiful face like it was a doormat.  And so, at that point, 
something clicked inside of Yumi. 

-- PROCESS -- 

Her eyes dilated. A sudden action that had nothing to do with the man 
that was choking her. Yumi&#39;s head tilted backwards, almost as if she 
were in a trance. And her large blue eyes suddenly thinned out, their 
previous blue swiftly shifting into a subsequent white. The suit stared 
curiously at the thin white of Yumi&#39;s eyes, but couldn&#39;t figure it out. 
But she was no longer concerned by his actions. In Yumi&#39;s head, the 
scene with herself being choked and Chizuru being kicked around 
vanished. And was replaced by constant flashes. Scenes of a certain 
moment in time buried inside her brain as deep and hidden as any old 
file in a computer system. This images now ran unbidden in Yumi&#39;s mind. 
To a far different location. In her mind she could see a hallway. A 
hallway of a lab. The white walls and chilled air so vivid, as if she 
were there at present. Even deeper... she could see a small girl of no 
more than five or six years of age. Her hair was white like newly fallen 
snow, crying her eyes out in the middle of that corridor. In her hand 
was a teddy bear. The other she used to rub the tears out of her eyes. 
In between her sobs, she muttered &#39;Daddy&#39; over and over again. And 
surrounding her were the bloody, broken corpses of four men. The red of 
their blood was smeared all over the ashen walls of that cold hallway, 
their corpses laying lifelessly in pools of it. Their skulls were broken 
open. The pur&#130;ed matter of their brain tissue, in all its pink and red 
glory, was splattered across the ground. The fragments of the bone of 
their skulls and the scattered remains of their hair dotted the bloody 
excess of their cracked heads. And yet all the same... that white-haired 
girl stood, her frilly dress stained with blood and brain matter, she 
stood crying, murmuring only one word. 

...Daddy...

Then Yumi&#39;s focus returned to the current situation, not the deeply 
suppressed images that dared to be thought of as memories. But the cause 
of them would be all the same. Yumi&#39;s now thin white eyes locked firmly 
on the one holding her by the neck. And a cold, almost chilling aura of 
silver awoke from her. Yumi&#39;s body was surrounded in a silver-flaming 
force that felt as cold as an arctic snowstorm. The coursing but frosty 
flames of silver covered her hands, her head, her legs, her chest, her 
thighs; all of her. All the while her snow-white hair rose up into the 
air, clearly presenting the sudden shift in her expression. The man 
holding her, whose body was now bathed in the glow of Yumi&#39;s silvery 
aura, blinked in alarm.  

-- REACTION --

&quot;Oh, crap!&quot; He expressed, &quot;Her Qi is awake! The biological lock isn&#39;t 
holding! Aaaa-AAAAHHH!&quot;

One flick of Yumi&#39;s eyes and the skull of that man exploded. In a bright 
flash of cold silver force, that man&#39;s head burst open, spraying blood 
and brain tissue over the stoop and over Yumi&#39;s emotionless face. His 
now decapitated body fell backwards, releasing Yumi&#39;s neck from that 
choke hold. It collapsed without motion, spreading the blood from the 
shattered neck outwardly. Yumi remained hovering in the air. And her 
head slowly turned to see the man on top of Chizuru. Both Chizuru and 
that man were silent and shocked. With nothing more than a look, Yumi 
had... killed someone. But in Chizuru&#39;s eyes... their was less in the 
way of shock... and more in the way of worry. Yumi, her body alight with 
those cold silver flames, floated across from the corpse of the dead 
suit to the torso of the living one. She lifted her hand up, as if to 
strike him down, but couldn&#39;t act. Her arm froze when it hit the air. 
Her whole body started to shake. From the tips of her fingers to the 
tips of her toes. The white of her eyes then revered back in blue, the 
wideness of them also returning. Yumi had recovered consciousness. But 
now she was bitterly aware of what she had done. And a haunted look 
framed her face. The cold fire of her manifest Qi soon evaporated into 
nothingness, causing her to fall to the ground. But Yumi&#39;s body still 
shook. She could... feel the blood and bone scraps over her face. As 
well as hear the sound of blood dripping off the edge of the pavement 
and into the drain. 

...Did I... did... I... kill... someone...?

Yumi, stricken by the realization, clasped her head, curling up into a 
fetal position. Her body shook constantly, over and over again, while 
the blood from the dead man stuck to her face. &quot;No... no... it&#39;s not 
true. It&#39;s not true. It&#39;s not true. It&#39;s not true. It&#39;s not true. It&#39;s 
not true. It&#39;s not true. It&#39;s not true. It&#39;s not true. It&#39;s not true. 
It&#39;s... not... true...  it&#39;s not... IT&#39;S NOT TRUE!&quot;

Yumi screamed out a bloodcurdling shriek of terror, one so loud that it 
echoed throughout the block. And then just as easily as that, she lost 
consciousness again. Her body jerked hard. Yumi&#39;s mind was emotionally 
exhausted. Chizuru and the man above her were still speechless. But 
there was someone else around who had seen the whole thing. Someone who 
was not at all surprised by this turn of events. A shadowed figure 
rushed out of the gap between two buildings across the road. His swift 
strides on his brown boots got him across the street quickly. Once he 
was there, the young man jumped up and swung his leg out. The last man 
in black didn&#39;t catch onto this in time. The unknown blonde man kicked 
him hard across the face, hearing him groan hard at the attack. The suit 
toppled over, robbed of his consciousness. And the young man who had 
done that, landed to the pavement. He beamed a stunning smile whilst 
running a hand through his long blonde bangs.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; He said to Chizuru, concerned. 

Chizuru exchanged glances between Yumi and this mystery man, who now 
looked to be western in origin. &quot;...I... I...&quot;

The blonde youth caught onto Chizuru&#39;s wordless state and was going to 
say something to soothe her, until they both noticed that a new flaming 
silver aura surrounded Yumi&#39;s unconscious body. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;What in the...? It&#39;s awakening?!&quot;

Deep below the building known as the Shinrai Complex was a multifaceted 
laboratory. The deep white of the walls and halls and the lab coats give 
this away without doubt. Hundreds of rooms were built in the 
jurisdiction of the lab. Each one used for separated purposes or 
experiments. Some technological, some biological. Over five levels and 
all of them underground, free from the risk of security breaches. Very 
few people other than those in the upper echelons of Protocol knew of 
this place.  Or of the importance of it. Such information was considered 
top secret amongst Protocol personnel. So much so that only a few 
hundred people (92% of those people being the scientists that actually 
worked there) had even heard about it. For secrets, those hidden even 
from lesser-ranked members of Protocol, were aplenty in that place. And 
it was known as the Ochiai Underground Research Facility. 

In the highest level of that underground laboratory, a large research 
room contained a certain something. A Meta Suit. These machines were 
gigantic humanoid-shape mecha. Designed specifically for combat, but 
also adapted for construction purposes. One particular Meta Suit stood 
upright in the large white room of that particular section of the Ochiai 
Underground Research Facility. At a towering height of 65.7 metres, with 
polished white and blue armouring made from the finest titanium that man 
had ever discovered. From its head  came two thick and ear-like antennae 
that extended backwards diagonally. Its face had been sculpted in a 
human-like shape, with the contours of eyes, and those red glass eyes 
were glowing brightly now. It was clearly a Meta Suit like no other. 
Hooked up to many large wires which were also connected, at the ceiling, 
to a net of harnesses that held them in place. The information that was 
gathered from the body of that Meta Suit was fed directly to the 
computers in a separate room via those cables. That room was right next 
to the holding chamber of the Meta Suit. A thick glass pane allowed the 
three scientists inside to observe what was happening to the machine 
armour from there. A given safety. 

One of them huddled by the computer terminals that was being fed 
information from the opposing room. His glasses were illuminated by the 
bright flashes of codes that was shown over the screen. So many at such 
a quick rate. 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it!&quot; He yelled ecstatically, &quot;these readings are off 
the charts! Someone&#39;s Qi is coalescing with the essence of the Oriax! At 
this rate, the suit will achieve activation in less than three minutes!&quot;

The second scientist looked out through the window pane to see the 
status of the Meta Suit they had dubbed as &#39;Oriax&#39;. Its armour was now 
covered with streaks of blue electricity, the sheen of the metal 
growing. The light of its red eyes came alive. And all the cables that 
had been attached to its arms, legs, chest, head and back broke off. 
They dropped from the torso of Oriax, spurting out clear white gases and 
rogue electricity, as well as a green substance in drops which closely 
resembled blood. The doctor pressed his hand into the glass and 
expressed a dazzling smile of wonder.

&quot;It&#39;s incredible...&quot; He said, &quot;it must be the one. The biological lock 
we were told about must be breaking. Now that it is free... it must 
be... acting unintentionally as a beacon. But whoever that person is, 
they must not know that...&quot;

A hard look came to him and he turned around to his colleagues. &quot;Come 
on, quickly now! The P.T.P (Phase Transport Phenomenon) will occur soon! 
Contact Control Room and tell them to deploy at least three Meta Suits 
as quickly as possible! And make sure that they inform Commander Celaph 
about this!&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Above ground, in the upper levels of the Shinrai Complex, was the office 
room of the commander in chief of Protocol&#39;s military affairs in Japan. 
That same man was Commander Celaph. Now gone from the window, he sat at 
the desk he had come to loathe for so long. It was such a place that a 
soldier should never have had to adjust to in his mind. But there was no 
real choice for him in the matter. The Triad of the Inquisition had 
given him his orders. It was a soldier&#39;s duty to follow them. But this 
time he was not the only soldier in that decorated office. Across from 
Celaph and his desk was the very same man that controlled the Divine 
Blade division of the Holy Protocol  Army. The same man, clad in haughty 
red garbs with his chest bearing the golden standard of the lion, that 
had won so many battles against insurgents to the Meta Cities in the 
Eurasia area. The man that was not born in the Meta Cities... but had a 
frightening will to prove himself to those who were with his 
overwhelmingly skilled hand in the art of piloting Meta Suits.

...That man, that infernal warrior, was known as General Naam. 

The tall, strident leader of the Divine Blade Meta Suit forces, who had 
been stationed in Japan only two weeks ago. With a great wide grin and 
his ornamental broadsword strapped to his side, General Naam stood 
before Celaph, saying,

&quot;Commander Celaph, is this true? You wish me to lead the attack against 
Chrysalis...? Are those our orders from the Upper Council?&quot;

Celaph shook his head. &quot;No. Not from the council. These orders come 
directly from the Triad of the Inquisition themselves. Thus you can 
understand why I summoned you from your quarters at such short notice.&quot;

&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; the general said sneakily, &quot;...it makes sense. But I won&#39;t 
pretend to care about the reason. Heh. All I care about is getting a 
second shot at Beatrix and her damned team. They made a FOOL of me in 
that battle at Shiratoo&#39;i, the bastards! This time they will pay with 
their lives!&quot;

Celaph smiled at the fiery Meta Suit warrior. &quot;Do not underestimate that 
woman&#39;s talents as a leader. We both know what she is capable of, do we 
not? Such a situation demands more than brute strength. We need wiles 
and intelligence to stop Chrysalis.&quot;

&quot;I fail to understand just what it is that you&#39;re getting at. What are 
you trying to say to me, Commander Celaph?&quot;

&quot;I have an informant who is following the movements of... a certain 
someone that is fundamental to our ultimate plans. I believe that that 
informant will soon have the details we need to both locate EDEN and 
launch an assault upon it. Just have patience. In the meantime, I want 
you to ready your men for the attack.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough, but,&quot; General Naam suddenly became serious as stone when 
he continued, &quot;I had actually believed that when you called me here, you 
might have had some information about... her...&quot;

Celaph held a hand to his chin. &quot;Are you talking about the one who 
escaped Ix Nos Babel? I had a feeling you would have inquired about her 
at some point.&quot;

&quot;Soldiers don&#39;t often ask favours. When they do it&#39;s often because they 
have something important to handle. That alone should have been enough 
of a warning to it.&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Celaph replied, &quot;but I wouldn&#39;t know much of it, now that I 
am forced to fight with pen and paper. In any case, we still have not 
yet caught up with her. But considering the calibre of the Meta Suit she 
pilots now... that is understandable. She was connected to your family 
somehow, was she not?&quot;

General Naam dragged his fist across his grey beard. &quot;That isn&#39;t really 
important right now. If you haven&#39;t found her then so be it. I&#39;ll take 
up the mission myself once Chrysalis is destroyed. Revenge is a certain 
something I like to carry onto the battlefield, too.&quot;

The commander smiled softly at that, but that smile faded when he heard 
the phone on his desk ring. Celaph lifted the receiver to his ear and 
listened in to what they had to say. His eyes narrowed with 
understanding to the comments being spoken into his ear, then he put 
down the phone. Shortly afterwards a second smile came to his face while 
he chuckled acrimoniously. 

Naam was curious. &quot;What was it?&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh...&quot; The commander leaned back in his chair, &quot;...that was 
the Control Room. It seems that the Oriax has finally awoken...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The cockpit of Oriax was unlike that of any other Meta Suit. Aside from 
the leather seat and the controls around it, it was not metallic. The 
surrounds of the cockpit were like a globular mass of water, fixed 
together to form a barrier that might have looked fragile to the naked 
eye, but acted as security the likes of which no one had ever known. For 
that strange cockpit existed inside a relatively small dimension. One 
that had been miniaturized with Qi manipulations  for the &#39;womb&#39; 
compartment of the Meta Suit. And the whole thing pulsed in rhythm like 
a clockwork heartbeat, every few seconds. Such technology was foreign 
fiction to all but Protocol. Their power manifest by nothing more than 
the existence of this tech.

A wisp of silver flames chilled the innards of that cockpit. And those 
flames formed into the girl known as Yumi Mishima. Teleportation as a 
result of unknown forces moved her through time and space into the 
cockpit of the Meta Suit. She dropped into the seat, her eyes resuming 
that pure white, and her body still burning with cold fire. Inside that 
trance of before, Yumi knew, subconsciously, what to do here. Her small 
hands gripped the control sticks that were built around the seat that 
hovered in that water-sphere womb barrier. In front of her appeared what 
looked to be a video screen. One that showed her what was going on 
around the Meta Suit from the eyes of the Oriax itself. Now she was in 
control. 

Outside the Oriax, in the Ochiai Underground Research Facility, was the 
layout of its holding chamber. In the separate observation room, the 
very same scientists who had informed Control Room of these developments 
were now marvelling at the sight of the Oriax coming to life. No one 
aside from a chosen few could pilot it. This was truly a sign. From 
behind the sheet of metal that acted as a mouthpiece for the Oriax, came 
a loud, bestial and ethereal scream that rumbled throughout that section 
of the research facility. That in itself was a testament to the fact 
that this... Meta Suit... was not completely mechanical. The Oriax 
tilted its large head backwards and &#39;looked&#39; upwards at the ceiling of 
the room it was trapped in. The polished breastplates of its armour shot 
open, one side swinging to the other, which showed the circular 
gemstone-like device in its chest. Acting as a kind of organ. That green 
&#39;heartstone&#39; started glowing. A light so bright that the scientists had 
to look away to keep themselves from being blinded. Oriax released 
another bestial war cry, causing a huge beam of searing, Qi-converted 
energy to shoot outward from its chest. Filling the entire chamber with 
unearthly emerald light. That energy beam burned savagely through the 
roof of the research facility. Everything in its path was burnt to 
cinders. The floors, the furniture, the scientists, the machines, the 
tests. Everything in the path of that beam, that Jupiter Maelstrom, was 
obliterated before knowledge of that obliteration came. It burned all 
the way up to the top level of the compound. There were gasps from the 
nearby people when they saw a towering pillar of light burst up from the 
gardens of the Shinrai Complex and climbed up into the skies above. 

The energy of the beam slowly faded away. With a hole successfully 
created in the ceiling of the chamber, all the way up to the top of the 
complex, Oriax jumped deftly through that hole with all the speed that 
it had been blessed with. The Meta Suit leapt out from the crater-hole 
into the scenes of Meta-Tokyo. All the people close enough to the 
complex could see both the Oriax and the energy blast that had preceded 
it. Waiting for the Oriax above ground were three Meta Suits. Each of 
them hovering in the air from their energy propulsion systems. They were 
combat Meta Suits, a type known as Zagan. They were armed with cannon 
rifles in their metallic, humanoid hands. Their black and brown military 
colours contrasting the white and blue of the taller Oriax. 

One of the pilots of the Zagan yelled out through a com link, saying, 
&quot;Is that the new experimental weapon that the research department was 
building?! I thought the only immediate forces stationed here were those 
of the Divine Blade accompanying General Naam!&quot;

&quot;Idiot!&quot; The second yelled, &quot;Those four-eyed bastards didn&#39;t create that 
thing for military use!&quot;
 
The third one, the one in command, scoffed. &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. We were 
ordered to bring the Meta Suit back down to the Ochiai labs so that&#39;s 
what we&#39;ll do! Move out!&quot;

&quot;...Roger!&quot;

&quot;Roger!&quot;

The three Zagan Meta Suits then charged the Oriax through the air. Their 
speed was far greater than that of land-based Meta Suits. But it did not 
seem to be an issue for the Oriax. As they came at it, they all pulled 
up their rifle cannons and fired continuous blasts at their target. The 
shots from the Zagan suits rained down on the Oriax in a coordinated 
wave that simply engulfed the machine. It was rocked by a series of 
compact explosions that surrounded it in clouds of smoke and flame. The 
Zagan-types fired on and on at the smoke cloud, burying more of their 
rounds into the &#39;enemy&#39; Meta Suit. 

Once a full number of 9,700 blasts had been fired, the Zagans lowered 
their guns and scanned the scene for the result. The suit had to have 
been disabled by all that. But when the smoke faded, they were all 
shocked to see that the Oriax had not even been scratched. It had 
enswathed itself inside a circular shield of emerald energy. One that 
protected it from all of the shots fired by the Zagan&#39;s  rifles. A 
second scream sounded out from the Oriax and it evaporated its shield. 
The white-armoured suit burst forwards with intense speed and grace, 
towards Zagan #1. The Oriax stuck out its hand and thrust it straight 
through the centre of the machine. The iron of the Zagan was no match 
for the titanium of the Oriax. The white suit reacted its hand and 
zoomed away. Subsequently, the first Zagan exploded in a bang of flame 
and metal; its remains falling out of the air. The second Zagan tried in 
vain to shoot down the Oriax. But it was no use. The line of fire now 
had a direct hit. But still the rounds could not pierce the armour of 
such a Meta Suit. Yumi&#39;s mecha put out its right hand to one side. Then 
a scimitar-shaped beam of energy formulated around it. Born of pure Qi 
from the pilot herself. The machine then flew across to Zagan #2. One 
powerful slash came down upon that standard military mecha. Slicing 
right through it. The machine exploded violently once the Gauntlet Blade 
had been dragged out of it. Leaving behind only one Meta Suit.

The pilot was, by now, terrified. &quot;This can&#39;t be... there&#39;s no way a 
Meta Suit can be this strong! It&#39;s just not possible!&quot;

The breastplates on the Oriax opened up again. The energy of the Jupiter 
Maelstrom blast was already gathering up. And it was fired just as 
easily as before. The third Zagan simply melted away within a roiling 
wave of jade Qi-force, one that did not simply shoot down the Zagan, but 
left absolutely no trace of it. The beam burnt right across the skies, 
travelling as far as the Neo-Shibuya district. All the city dwellers 
marvelled at the sparkling green light that brightened and darkened the 
air all at once. The light of the heavens. Once it vanished with the end 
of the beam the Oriax was left screaming its yell over the space of the 
city. It had destroyed three Zagan-types with less than an afterthought. 

From the window of the head office, Celaph and Naam could see the Oriax 
and hear its scream. General Naam was astounded by the sheer power of 
the mecha, but Commander Celaph just grinned, closing his eyes with a 
dirty chuckle. &quot;...For all intensive purposes... this is a setback. But 
one cannot speak of the consequences without first speaking of the 
lesson... as well as the realities of that same situation.&quot;

Naam turned to Celaph. &quot;...What do you mean by that?&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t understand. Because there are very few that actually 
would. The bread of the body has been bitten... and the wine of the 
blood has been sipped. The rebirth of a Novus Deus, a perfect God, will 
soon be at hand.&quot;
