<a href="../original/allgirls-ch57.html">Back to Part 57</a><pre>Nobody knows

Just why we&#39;re here

Could it be fate

Or random circumstance

At the right place

At the right time

Two roads intertwine

And if the universe conspired

To meld our lives

To make us

Fuel and fire

Then know

Where ever you will be

So too shall I be

Close your eyes

Dry your tears

&#39;Coz when nothing seems clear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Weary heart

You&#39;ll be safe here

Remember how we laughed

Until we cried

At the most stupid things

Like we were so high

But love was all that we were on

We belong

And though the world would

Never understand

This unlikely union

And why it still stands

Someday we will be set free.

Pray and believe

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

Save your eyes

From your tears

When everything&#39;s unclear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Wounded heart

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

In my arms

Through the long cold night

Sleep tight

You&#39;ll be safe here

When no one understands

I&#39;ll believe

You&#39;ll be safe,

You&#39;ll be safe

You&#39;ll be safe here

Put your heart in my hands

You&#39;ll be safe here

&quot;Nurse Ana&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here, Ana,&quot; said Nikka Zanders. &quot;Rai&#39;s been so sick, 
it&#39;s a miracle she hasn&#39;t coughed out her spleen yet. I&#39;m sure she could 
use someone like you to, um, see to it that she gets well.&quot;

&quot;Happy to help,&quot; said Ana. A sack of items in one hand and a small 
suitcase in the other, she followed Rai&#39;s younger sister upstairs to her 
girlfriend&#39;s room. Rai had of course taken ill in the early December 
weather, and being something of a recluse, had not told anybody except 
her family, who quarantined her in her room to avoid spreading the 
virus. Nikka had called Ana, knowing the younger girl would want to 
help, and had been expecting her since.

&quot;So what&#39;s in the bags?&quot; she asked, eyeing them.

&quot;Oh, just some stuff. I brought some soup and hot sauce; that usually 
clears me up. And of course orange juice and milk. Does Rai still drink 
grapefruit juice?&quot;

&quot;Uh, I didn&#39;t even know she liked it.&quot;

&quot;I guess not then. I brought some just in case. She needs her vitamins.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Nikka as they mounted the stairs. &quot;Rai eats 
well and exercises a lot. You&#39;ve seen her; she&#39;s practically a jock. And 
it&#39;s not like she hangs around a lot of people. You&#39;re not infected, are 
you?&quot;

&quot;Nope. Must be a winter thing.&quot;

&quot;Winter starts on the twenty-first, Ana.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; The girl gave a goofy grin, and hoisted her bags again. 
&quot;Anyway, aside from the groceries, I also brought this vapor thing. I 
use it all the time when I&#39;m sick; it really helps me breathe. And the 
hot sauce really clears you up.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think my &#145;brother&#39; will like that,&quot; murmured Nikka, &quot;but I&#39;m not 
the one who&#39;s gonna be pouring that stuff down her throat. Heh, your 
funeral. And the suitcase?&quot;

&quot;Oh, um...a change of outfit.&quot;

&quot;Why? You look great today.&quot; Ana blushed shyly and looked away.

&quot;Um...it&#39;s for Rai.&quot;

&quot;Oh, dressing up, eh?&quot; Nikka giggled and poked Ana with her elbow 
several times. &quot;Yeah, I know how it is. &#145;Oh nurse Ana, I need my 
temperature taken again!&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; laughed Lu, slapping Nikka away. They reached the sick girl&#39;s 
room; her sister hung back and crossed her arms.

&quot;Okay, here we are, prince charming&#39;s bedroom. If you get the kissing 
sickness, don&#39;t blame me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in good health. I just got over something, so I&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

&quot;Mm, famous last words.&quot; Nikka left snickering; Ana shrugged, knocked, 
and walked in the room. She found Rai on her bed, still in her pajamas, 
currently sitting up and reading. She smiled and waved quietly, and 
coughed.

&quot;Looks like I came at the right time,&quot; said Ana, relieving herself of 
her baggage. Rai eyed it curiously.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Nurse Ana&#39;s specialty! Be right back&#151;here, have some juice in the 
meantime.&quot;

&quot;I already&#151;&quot; Rai found herself forced to hold two glasses, one yellowy 
and one orange, while Ana left the room. She smelled them suspiciously, 
turned her head to cough, and sipped at each. One orange, one 
grapefruit. So Ana remembered their very first meeting! She remembered 
Rai liked grapefruit! Zanders grinned and finished half the glass, 
loving the bittersweet taste. She put both glasses down, coughed, and 
put her book away. She was curious about Ana: where had she gone, 
anyway?

She came back shortly, but dressed just a wee bit different than before.

Raisa Zanders&#39; eyes bugged out as she stared at Ana Lu, barely squeezed 
into a skimpy, sexy little nurse&#39;s outfit.

&quot;Whoa,&quot; she whispered, &quot;you look good enough to eat in that.&quot;

&quot;Ya think?&quot; she asked, turning around slightly to give herself (and 
Rai!) a better look. Zanders swallowed nervously and started to 
salivate.

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

&quot;Heh, just don&#39;t eat me for real, okay? Now, I&#39;m gonna put a cool rag on 
your head...&quot;

&quot;Mm, that sounds nice.&quot; Rai watched in pleasure as Ana turned around, 
deliberately bent over as far as she could to dip a sponge in a bucket 
she had brought, and caught her breath as the young blonde came back and 
tapped her head with it. The cool water eased her fiery headache; Ana&#39;s 
openly exposed cleavage made Rai heat up in a completely different way. 
She wanted to grab Ana and ravish her, but her illness made her weak, 
and she didn&#39;t want this generous girl to get sick as well.

&quot;Hey, quit!&quot; laughed Ana as she slapped Rai&#39;s wandering hand away. 
Zanders grinned and touched her wrist.

&quot;You gonna take my temperature, Nurse Ana?&quot;

&quot;Oh, brother, that&#39;s what your sister said!&quot;

&quot;My sister? Jeez... I guess I better come up with another line.&quot; Ana 
smiled brightly, told her girl not to worry about it, and sure enough 
brought out a thermometer&#151;and wedged it in between her breasts. She bent 
over, silently inviting Rai to remove it&#151;preferably with her teeth. 
Zanders got the hint and slowly pulled it out, making her girlfriend 
squeak just a little. Then Ana got serious.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna use your kitchen for awhile, is that okay? I need to make you 
soup.&quot; Rai rolled the device in her mouth around so she could talk.

&quot;I hope it&#39;s not chicken noodle soup.&quot;

&quot;Nope, it&#39;s cream of celery. I know you like it, so I bought the 
expensive stuff.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re too kind.&quot;

&quot;Nah, no problem. Anything for my Rai-chan.&quot; Ana ruffled her lover&#39;s 
dark-blue hair, kissed her forehead&#151;&quot;Mm, need to wet that rag again, 
you&#39;re burning up.&quot;&#151;and was gone to make the girl&#39;s dinner. While she 
was away, Rai spat out the thermometer and glanced at it. She made a 
face as she saw the high number.

&quot;Must be Ana&#39;s doing,&quot; she reasoned. &quot;That girl always did make me a 
little warm under the collar.&quot;

.........

Ana came back with the soup steaming hot, a spoon, some crackers, and a 
glass with ice for the juice. Rai was healthy enough to scoot out of bed 
and sit up, so she directed Ana to where her small in-table was and 
placed the food there. She wanted to kiss Ana as thanks, but her 
sickness... So instead, she just expressed her thanks with words and a 
gentle smile.

&quot;No problem. Say, would you like a back rub?&quot;

&quot;Mm, and a neck rub please.&quot; Ana complied and did as Rai requested; 
Zanders moaned softly as the girl she loved gave her tender care. The 
soup was better than she expected&#151;Ana had not microwaved it&#151;and the cool 
juice sent the steaming meal down easily. Rai moaned over how good the 
food was, and worked her hand back so she could touch her dear 
caretaker.

&quot;Mm, what&#39;s in this? It tastes different than the normal brand.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I put some hot sauce in there. It&#39;s pretty good for clearing up the 
sinuses.&quot;

&quot;Hot sauce?&quot; Rai made a face, but sure enough, her nose felt less 
congested again. Shrugging, she dug in again, not caring about the new 
flavor. Ana completed her massage and went over to plug up the vapor 
machine she had brought so Rai&#39;s congestion could be fought seriously. 
Once it was activated, she scooted over to give the girl&#39;s neck and 
shoulders a kiss each, then hugged her from behind as she ate.

&quot;Love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too, Ana.&quot;

&quot;Love is the best medicine,&quot; she said, squeezing her girlfriend&#39;s tummy. 
&quot;And as soon as you get better, I&#39;m gonna love you so much, you&#39;ll never 
get sick again.&quot;

&quot;...That sounds nice,&quot; she purred. Rai eventually finished her soup, 
washed it down, and turned to face her beloved. Ana shirked away as the 
sick girl crept up to her, and nearly fell on the floor as she turned 
around to cough and sneeze.

&quot;Bless you!&quot; she said, handing her a tissue. Rai honked on it several 
times and threw it away. &quot;Ah&#151;don&#39;t forget to wash your hands.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Right.&quot;

&quot;Hey, how about I draw you a hot bath? I bet that&#39;ll help.&quot;

&quot;That would be great. You wanna join me?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I definitely do, but you know I can&#39;t, babe. I&#39;d get sick.&quot;

&quot;Nn-nnh,&quot; she argued as she headed for the door. Rai had her own private 
bathroom, as did her mother (her sister shared). &quot;Not if you&#39;re 
careful.&quot;

&quot;Still, I don&#39;t wanna risk it.&quot; Ana headed for the bathroom and started 
the water, Rai watched her squat down, not knowing whether to stare at 
the girl&#39;s cute protruding rear or her sensual, curvy chest. She settled 
for Ana&#39;s unbound yellowy hair, and buried her face in it to inhale its 
fragrance. Ana giggled and made sure the bath was warm enough, then 
focused back on Rai.

&quot;Hey, you. Take your clothes off.&quot; Rai grinned; Ana yelped. &quot;You 
pervert, you know what I mean!&quot;

&quot;And here I thought I was supposed to be aggressive.&quot; Rai happily 
complied, coughing a few more times as she removed her pajamas. To say 
that Ana ogled the tall girl mercilessly was like saying it was cold 
outside. She dismissed herself to use another bathroom; Rai tested the 
waters and relieved herself in her own latrine while the water filled 
up. Ana came back before long&#151;the tub was full and Rai, though sick, was 
waiting with a seductive stare on her face&#151;and reached out to tickle her 
girlfriend&#39;s breasts.

&quot;You&#39;re so cute,&quot; she crooned. Rai slapped Ana&#39;s hand away and lowered 
herself into the tub; Ana removed her nurse&#39;s outfit, to her 
girlfriend&#39;s delight, and knelt down clad only in white lacy 
undergarments (hosiery included) to &quot;give my patient a sponge bath&quot;. Rai 
was beginning to wish she got sick more often.

&quot;Hey, come on, get in here,&quot; she said playfully. &quot;I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s easier 
to reach all my secret areas if you&#39;re close up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m perfectly fine here!&quot; she exclaimed merrily. Rai managed to laugh 
before she coughed, and submerged completely. Barbs and innuendo aside, 
the bath went well and Rai did indeed feel better once she stepped out 
to dry herself. Ana helped with the girl&#39;s long hair, and couldn&#39;t help 
but squeeze her naked rear (or, once, her womanhood) a few times. By the 
time they were done, Zanders had refused to get dressed and strolled 
into her room with only a towel on, followed by Ana who was hastily 
getting into her nurse&#39;s outfit again. Rai growled seductively and 
grabbed her.

&quot;Ah-ah-ah, what do you think you&#39;re doing, kitten?&quot;

&quot;Um, getting dressed?&quot; Rai grinned and snapped at her ear, taking it 
into her mouth. Ana yelped. &quot;Nuu, not the ear sickness!&quot;

&quot;Silly girl,&quot; she whispered. Rai grabbed and pulled at the nurse&#39;s 
outfit, throwing it onto the ground before she attacked Ana&#39;s 
undergarments. Lu protested the onslaught for the first time in her 
life, and insisted that she not be asked for sexual favors that day.

&quot;Seriously, seriously!&quot; she said, though still laughing. &quot;Rai, baby, I 
can&#39;t, I can&#39;t! God, I want to, babe, honestly I do&#151;I&#39;m so horny I can&#39;t 
even think straight&#151;but if we do, you know I&#39;ll get sick, and I know you 
don&#39;t want that.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m feeling better,&quot; said Rai, and indeed her voice did seem 
stronger. She dropped her towel at last, making Ana&#39;s eyes bulge out in 
surprise despite having seen the same goods not three minutes ago. &quot;As 
you can see, I&#39;m feeling a lot bet&#151;&quot; A vile cough racked through her, 
and Rai crumbled to her bed again so she could at least support herself. 
Ana ran over to hug her and help her in, and sighed wearily as she 
undressed and joined poor Rai in bed.

&quot;I might regret this,&quot; she said, &quot;but maybe it&#39;s for the best. Ya know, 
when I pleasure myself, I usually feel a little better, but only if I 
don&#39;t have a headache.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have one.&quot; Ana smiled and hugged Rai, making sure to give her a 
good grope. Zanders squealed from the attention and nestled her lover&#39;s 
hands deep into her bosom; their lovemaking was only interrupted by the 
occasional cough, sneeze, and demand from Rai&#39;s sister that &quot;you two 
better shut up before I call the police!&quot;

Three days later, Rai was back on her feet.

The next day, Ana came down with a sickness, just as she had thought.

It was time for Nurse Raisa to attend to her patient.
