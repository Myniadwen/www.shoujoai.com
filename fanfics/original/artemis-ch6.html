&quot;Egypt is dead,&quot; the elegant cat-woman took the
shallow cup of cream and drank, licking her lips
sensuously as she blinked golden eyes, &quot;at least to
it&#39;s old gods. Of our pantheon I am one of the few who
remain, if only an echo of what I once was.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re still around, Bast,&quot; Diana
answered the Egyptian cat-goddess seriously, her brown
hair tied back in a ponytail. Her skirt hugged her
slim body, the matching black leather top cupping her
breasts and gently pushing them up.

&quot;There are times,&quot; Bast sighed, her mostly human
features bearing a decidedly feline cast, &quot;I wish I
had followed my kin into oblivion. It can be lonely,
being one of the last.&quot; Her hair fell into her eyes,
the strands the oddest shade of gray.

Diana smiled a very grim little smile, &quot;There are
worse fates.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Bast agreed.

Diana hesitated, &quot;You know about...?&quot;

&quot;I can not assist you, old friend, &quot; Bast sighed as
she shook her head reluctantly. She smiled at her
wryly, &quot;I am barely a ghost compared to the height of
my power, now only the last fragments of cat-worship
still sustain me.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re not still a target,&quot; Diana
reminded her. She smiled grimly, &quot;Just consider it,
please.&quot;

Around them the bar was busy, many of the men and
woman of the community retreating here to escape the
winter chill. Diana and Circe had been serving
customers on and off most of the night, each taking
short breaks to talk with friends or grab a fast bite
to eat.

Circe smiled to herself fondly as she watched her
lover talk to an old friend. Personally the blonde
haired sorceress didn&#39;t think too much of the old
gods, but Diana seemed to feel the need to maintain a
connection to those beings. &#39;And at least she&#39;s
quieter than the Asgardians were,&#39; she mused,
&#39;bezerker gods are always trouble.&#39;

&quot;So how&#39;s the army building going?&quot; Circe asked as
Diana excused herself from her conversation with Bast
and joined her.

&quot;I&#39;m not building an army,&quot; Diana started before the
front doors crashed open.

All eyes turned as the three young women stood in the
doorway, battered and bloody. They seemed like mirror
images of each other, antique robes hanging limply
over their strong bodies as they swayed there weakly.
One gently supported the most wounded of their group
as she looked up to the bar and cried, &quot;Sanctuary!&quot;

Circe took charge instinctively, clapping her hands to
get the attention of the customers even as Diana
rushed to the women&#39;s side. &quot;I would strongly advise
anyone leaving who doesn&#39;t want to get involved with
potentially big trouble,&quot; Circe called out seriously.

In a few moments all the customers were mostly gone,
only one or two people still lingering to help. Dr.
Katherine Delafield looked over the badly wounded
woman with a critical eye, her gray streaked hair tied
back roughly then commented, &quot;If I didn&#39;t know better
I&#39;d say she was attacked by someone using a sword.&quot;

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Diana said bleakly.

&quot;Here,&quot; Elizabeth carried over the medical kit, the
pretty blonde hurrying as much as her dangerously low
dress would allow. Along with her facial scar and back
tattoo a new insignia had been added to her upper arm,
the brightness showing it was new.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Katherine grabbed the kit and began to clean
the injured triplet&#39;s wounds with alcohol, drawing a
hiss of pain from the woman.

&quot;Please save our sister.....&quot; one sister started.

&quot;....without her we would surely die.&quot; the other
mostly unhurt one finished.

&quot;I don&#39;t think the injuries are fatal,&quot; Katherine
replied, frowning at the depth of some of the cuts,
&quot;but a hospital wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea.&quot;

&quot;I kind of doubt they&#39;ll do that,&quot; Elizabeth said
dryly.

&quot;Are they who I think they are?&quot; Circe asked Diana
softly, her whole body tense.

&quot;The Furies,&quot; Diana nodded grimly, &quot;the three spirits
of Vengeance that predated even the gods of Olympus.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Circe looked surprised as she asked
her lover, &quot;I thought that they were created by the
gods?&quot;

Diana smiled bleakly, &quot;Just more lies from Zeus, love.
He may have taken credit for their existence, but they
owe their true allegiance to ancient powers.&quot;

&quot;So why are they here?&quot; Circe scowled.

&quot;I can take a good guess,&quot; Diana dropped her voice
even more as she continued on, &quot;I think they tried to
strike out at Zeus to avenge those that he&#39;s slain, as
they are compelled to do by the powers that they
serve.&quot;

&quot;Three god-like beings going up against Zeus?&quot; Circe
sighed as she tried to imagine it, &quot;They must have
been slaughtered.&quot;

Katherine rose, wiping off her bloody hands as she
looked over to the other two sisters and tiredly said,
&quot;The worst wounds been sealed and I think they&#39;re
clean. Baring unforeseen complications she should be
fine, once she sleeps this off.&quot;

&quot;We thank you for your help....&quot; she bowed.

&quot;.... ask a boon of us at any time, it will be
granted,&quot; the other Fury bowed, too.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Katherine nodded gravely. Under her
breath she muttered, &quot;And to think, I was just here
tonight looking for Hunter....&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t asking what&#39;s going on?&quot; Diana looked at
Katherine curiously.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I really want to know,&quot; Katherine
replied as she headed back towards her table and the
stiff drink that awaited her. Elizabeth hesitated, the
young woman clearly tempted to ask, then she decided
to follow the other woman&#39;s example.

&quot;I&#39;m almost glad that mostly everyone left,&quot; Diana
commented as she and Circe watched the two Furies
carry their sister over to a couch and lay her out
there.

&quot;So what are their names?&quot; Circe asked while they
accompanied them over there.

&quot;They don&#39;t have names, exactly,&quot; Diana answered
honestly, &quot;just descriptions of their functions. One
searches, one judges and finally another punishes the
guilty party.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Circe sighed.

The leader of the Furies left her sister watching over
her wounded sibling and walked to their side, her eyes
grim. &quot;I&#39;m sorry to bring this to your door,&quot; she said
simply.

&quot;You knew about Zeus&#39; oath not to harm this bar or
anyone in it,&quot; Diana sighed, not even making it a
question.

&quot;I am the searcher, the gatherer of wisdom,&quot; the Fury
said frankly, &quot;of course I knew.&quot;

&quot;This could bring on a confrontation with Zeus,&quot; Diana
looked like she was restraining her temper, &quot;there is
no way we&#39;re ready for that.&quot;

The Fury raised her chin in a proud gesture, &quot;We hurt
him, milady, even as he tried to strike our dear
sister down. It will take some time before he ventures
forth from his palace again, even with his greater
abilities.&quot;

Circe put her hand on Diana&#39;s arm to calm her as she
asked, &quot;Will Zeus hold to his oath, with us sheltering
these three in here?&quot;

Grimly Diana shrugged, &quot;Breaking his oath would hurt
him, in his standing among the other Olympians. Most
still remain unaware of his true nature, and he needs
to keep them in the dark for as long as possible.&quot;

&quot;And if he does attack?&quot; the Fury asked, for a moment
looking more like a frightened young woman than a
deity of Vengeance.

&quot;Then we pray that mortal forged sorcerous defenses
can hold up against a god&#39;s might,&quot; Circe said to her
flatly.

Diana put her hand on her lover&#39;s arm, calming her.
&quot;We&#39;ve got some breathing room,&quot; she reminded Circe,
&quot;we&#39;ll just have to wait and see.&quot;</pre>
