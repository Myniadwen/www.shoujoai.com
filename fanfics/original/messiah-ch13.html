Chronicle Thirteen - G. O. D (gamble of destiny) 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Meta Suit hanger of the Kamiyashiki was smaller than Yumi thought it 
would have been. The previous day Tomoko had explained to her that it 
could only contain around five Meta Suits. Six at the very most. And 
that was really the case when Yumi  took a deeper inspection of it. The 
hanger was around eighty metres by another eight  metres long. Just tall 
enough for Meta Suits to be contained. And saying that; there were only 
three suits available for use down there. One of them was obviously the 
Bishamon. Yumi didn&#39;t know the other two. But she spent some time just 
staring at the Bishamon anyway. 

It reminded her so much of Terry.

Back in the old days; Terry was the first person that Yumi could have 
stood up and said with total confidence &#39;you are my friend&#39; to. He had 
helped her evaluate herself. Terry set Yumi on the right path by 
offering his friendship. But what had become of all that now? Terry was 
still alive... somehow... but he couldn&#39;t remember her. That was 
understandable. He had managed to live out a life for 6000 years the 
chances were high that he wouldn&#39;t remember every little detail from his 
earliest days. But it hurt Yumi to think that the one person she called 
a friend was now so close and at the same time so far away. And if it 
wasn&#39;t for Tomoko&#39;s comfort yesterday, Yumi could have imagined herself 
doing something... drastic. The second that Tomoko came into Yumi&#39;s 
thoughts, the Japanese woman sported a bright blush over her pale 
cheeks. She didn&#39;t really understand why but Yumi really liked Tomoko. A 
sexual attraction was a given, there was no question about that. But she 
liked Tomoko as a person too. She seemed like a more serious, courageous 
version of the woman that Yumi though she knew to be &#39;Chizuru 
Matsubana&#39;. Of course that was just an elaborate mask for Chizu Yagata 
to hide behind. But Tomoko... she was different somehow. She was real.

While Yumi thought of Tomoko before the towering presence of the great 
Bishamon Meta Suit, Terry Hennig came strolling by with a spanner in 
hand. The young man caught sight of Yumi looking at his suit and walked 
up to her, saying. &quot;Hey, kid. You okay?&quot;

Yumi&#39;s eyes rolled to the left. &quot;...Terry.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my name,&quot; The blonde youth looked up at his suit, &quot;He&#39;s a 
beauty, isn&#39;t he? Bishamon M-4 has seen me through some rough times. But 
from what I hear from that Doctor Fahlem guy... that Oriax of yours is 
probably ten times greater than this is. Is that true?&quot;

Yumi sighed. &quot;...The Oriax... is... quite powerful.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t be asking you stuff like this. We&#39;ve gotta carry 
out the mission soon. And we&#39;re only a mile or so away from the St. 
Mary&#39;s base at the moment, too. Besides... Tomoko said that you&#39;re under 
a lot of stress so... we shouldn&#39;t bother you too much...&quot;

A tiny smile came from Yumi. &quot;...Tomoko did?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Terry pressed his hand into his hip, &quot;this boss can be... 
difficult sometimes, sure. But she&#39;s got her heart in the right place. 
You don&#39;t find too many people like that these days. But then... she&#39;d 
probably say the same thing about the rest of us. That&#39;s just who she 
is.&quot;

Then another thought came to Yumi&#39;s mind. &quot;...Terry... can I ask you 
something? Please?&quot;

&quot;Shoot.&quot;

&quot;Where do you come from?&quot; Suddenly Yumi was starting to think that the 
Terry she knew and the Terry standing next to her were separate in some 
way. It was something to do with what he said about Tomoko. 

Terry crossed his arms. &quot;Me? I come from Aryahm. I grew up in a family 
that placed a tradition in fighting. My Dad was a soldier. My Mom was a 
soldier. My grandparents were soldiers. That was who we were. From as 
early a time as ever I wanted to be a pilot for Meta Suits. So when I 
turned ten I joined a youth training division for entry into the 
Schutzenreich. In terms of ability and Qi Force I ranked in at a 
D-Grade. And to be a member of the Schutzenreich you need a rank of at 
the very least, C. So I joined a new experimental scheme. A scheme 
called the Sohei Project. It was instigated by the Ministry of 
Metaphysical and Biotechnological Neo-Eugenic Research. By using muscle 
enhancers, brainwave re-writers and shock treatments, all those involved 
in the Sohei Project, including me, were changed into the perfect 
soldiers. Those with Qi-Levels high enough to pilot Meta Suits like 
Bishamon.&quot;

Yumi blinked. &quot;...Where did you find this?&quot;

&quot;Apparently it&#39;s a remake of a model that was damaged shortly after the 
Divine Cataclysm. A woman called Diana Katrianna, the driving force 
behind the Sohei Project, rebuilt this thing and gave it to me as a 
symbol of my new position in the Schutzenreich.&quot;

&quot;So then... what happened...?&quot;

&quot;...Skye happened...&quot; Terry said with a blush and a smile, &quot;I met him 
and we just... fell in love. There was no explanation I could give to 
say that any better. That was just how it was. From the moment I saw 
him... I knew that I wanted to protect and care for him. But there were 
problems just like their always are. He was the grandson of Gustav 
K&#148;hler, leader of the Schutzenreich. And I was commissioned to go 
suppress rebels in Jaankang and the like. So I could never be there for 
him if I went through with the induction. I tried to explain to 
Commander K&#148;hler that I wanted to remain as a soldier for the city&#39;s 
defence... that way I could still be around Skye and fulfil my family&#39;s 
wishes. But found out about my relationship with his grandson. That 
pretty much put the nail in the coffin. He was grooming Skye to be his 
successor so... that kind of &#39;behaviour&#39; wasn&#39;t acceptable to him. So 
Skye and I fled with the Bishamon... and a month later we hooked up with 
Tomoko and the Kamiyashiki.&quot;

&quot;...I see...&quot; Yumi sighed, &quot;...I guess I was wrong...?&quot;

&quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;...Don&#39;t worry about it. I suppose I should go find Tomoko and Doctor 
Fahlem. But... thanks for speaking with me.&quot;

Yumi stepped off the slight elevation of the platform surrounded the 
feet of Bishamon M-4 and while Terry bid her a fond &#39;no problem&#39;. She 
walked off towards the far corner of the Meta Suit Hanger. Terry watched 
her leave and then turned back around. But from the corner of his eye he 
could see a certain someone. Skye K&#148;hler. The young hacker stood with 
his wavy hair swept back behind his ears, staring over at Terry with a 
unstill glassy look in his eyes. Terry turned to him and pulled another 
one of his confident smiles.

&quot;Skye,&quot; He said, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

The eighteen-year-old tightened his fists. &quot;...Please...&quot;

&quot;What? Be careful?&quot; Terry hopped off the platform that the Bishamon was 
on and jogged up to the boy. He placed his hands on Skye&#39;s shoulders and 
gave him another reassuring grin, &quot;Look. I&#39;m never gonna leave you like 
that, okay? I&#39;m not gonna die out there. This will be the first time... 
in months... that you and I have gotten mixed up with the Ashurian 
Empire. I know you&#39;re worried about it. But... I just have this weird 
feeling about... that Yumi girl. I think she&#39;s important. And I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;m the only one who sees it. I mean it&#39;s obvious that the boss is 
hot for her, but... I think she understands it too. We need to help her, 
Skye. I just have this gut feeling about it.&quot;

Skye wrapped his arms around Terry&#39;s neck. &quot;...I... understand...&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m glad,&quot; Terry admitted, &quot;...I have your support in this. &#39;Cause I 
have a feeling that following Yumi on her path is gonna lead us back to 
Aryahm again. And I know that we can&#39;t run from it forever.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

After it being delivered to the compound on the previous day, the Oriax 
was transported to the lower level of the St. Mary&#39;s Base. It stood now 
alongside the imposing length and figure of the Kaiser Halberd. In that 
gigantic underground cave that had been dug underneath the base so many 
years ago. People were scanning it over constantly to attain data from 
it. Over twenty scientists were on the ground level of assess and study 
the details and readings they could obtain from the Meta Suit. It seemed 
almost as important to them as the Kaiser Halberd had been during its 
production phase. It was the Meta Suit that Aratia de Toscana was 
supposed to be guarding during her stay at the St. Mary&#39;s Base. But she 
cared very little for such a thing. Though only Meta Suit that was of 
any importance to her was the model of her own possession, Hanuman. 

And of course... Hanuman wasn&#39;t on Aratia&#39;s mind at this precise moment 
in time. The blonde woman with the elongated hair stood behind one of 
the railings of the upper platform and overlooked the setting down 
below. That of the dozens of scientists working on the formal completion 
of the Kaiser Halberd and assessing the readings of the Oriax. A young 
woman scientist had led her down here upon ushering, one that stood 
beside Aratia with a clipboard clutched between her hands.

&quot;This is it, Miss Toscana,&quot; The young woman said, &quot;this is the place we 
have decided to store the Oriax in. I am... sure you will agree that it 
is a fabulous piece of machinery.&quot;

Aratia sighed, with her elbows perched on the railing. &quot;...A fabulous 
piece of machinery? Well if you wanna put it like that. The thing was a 
bitch to transport since no one can ride it. If we still had that girl 
maybe we could have flown it here instead.&quot;

&quot;I think it is beautiful,&quot; Said the girl scientist, &quot;and to think that 
such a weapon was created more than 6000 years ago. It is more powerful 
than most of the modern Meta Suits. The only one of any comparative 
strength has to be that newer model that the Ministry of Metaphysical 
and Biotechnological Neo-Eugenic Research are working on.&quot;

&quot;A new model?&quot; Aratia said inquisitively, &quot;...Oh, you must mean that 
hyper-expensive thing they&#39;re working on in Aryahm. I was supposed to 
oversee that rather than this old piece of junk but for some reason they 
switched around my mission... blast it. Dah well. Work isn&#39;t the only 
thing on my mind...&quot;

Aratia turned the scientist a lusty smile. &quot;...It&#39;s the same for you, 
right?&quot;

&quot;...Um... well...&quot; 

When the girl went red in the face, Aratia pulled another grin and 
leaned in towards her aggressively. With their faces inches apart and 
the young woman breathing with exceeding pace, Aratia began her charm. 
&quot;...Why is it that doctors and scientists like yourself are so shy? Did 
you ever wonder what it&#39;d be like to just cut loose for once and... be a 
little bit of a bad girl?&quot;

The scientist&#39;s blush deepened and she struggled to look away, knowing 
that Aratia&#39;s lips were less than a few centimetres from her own. &quot;I... 
I... um... I do not believe that this is... a very appropriate...or 
professional... conversation... Miss Toscana. I...&quot;

&quot;...You&#39;re so cute, you know that? Right now I feel like just tearing 
off all of those clothes and...&quot;

An interrupting cough stopped them from going any further than that. 
Both Aratia and the bashful girl scientist looked to their right to see 
a silent Diana Katrianna with a fist to before her lips. The scientist 
girl swallowed the lump in her throat and stepped back, saying; &quot;Um... I 
think I should be going n-now... e-excuse me...&quot;

And a minute later she was gone, exiting through the lift that would 
take her back up to the surface of the compound. Aratia&#39;s shoulders 
sagged when the girl went about her business. &quot;Oh man... she left...&quot;

&quot;Do you really think that kind of behaviour is apt for someone of your 
standing?&quot; Diana asked rhetorically. 

Aratia scowled at her. &quot;And what the hell do you want? I&#39;m stationary 
here like you asked, right? What more do you need?!&quot;

&quot;My goodness, aren&#39;t you rather high strung? You should calm yourself 
sometimes Miss Toscana. A frenzied outlook tends to overlook the smaller 
details in life. That often leads to mistakes.&quot;

&quot;Is this the point where I&#39;m supposed to start caring or understanding 
these little comments of yours?&quot; Growled Aratia, &quot;I&#39;ve spent the past 
day in this goddamn cube and I&#39;m sick of it. And the moment I find a 
single good looking woman in this dump, YOU come around and stop me from 
scoring. What don&#39;t I have to be &#39;high strung&#39; about?&quot;

Diana smiled calmly at her. &quot;...You don&#39;t ever change, do you? But if 
you knew the secrets of the weapon you have been forced to guard... I am 
sure you would rate this mission with a far higher importance than you 
seem to have for it now.&quot;

&quot;And what does that mean?&quot; Asked the soldier. 

&quot;The Oriax is important to us,&quot; Diana affirmed, just as she walked to 
the railing and stared out at the machine, &quot;its power is great but there 
is a lot more to it than what you can see or what you can detect with 
computers. Just the simple thought of the idea that Seraphiel&#39;s original 
nucleus is inside of that mecha... it fills me with pride. Pride that 
such a thing should be uncovered in my lifetime... whether I 
commissioned the act or not.&quot;

Aratia scratched her temple. &quot;...Okay, you&#39;ve lost me now.&quot;

&quot;You do not need to know about those details at this point. I only ask 
you to show a greater respect for the beast we have in our possession. 
You may not see it as anything more than an outdated relic but the Oriax 
is a very important tool for this era. You cannot take it likely. If you 
do... you will end up dead.&quot;

The blonde woman chuckled. &quot;This coming from someone whose never even 
fought in a battle? Thanks for the lecture but I can handle myself 
pretty well in that respect. And for the record-&quot;

Aratia then cut herself off when the alarm bells went off. The set of 
red lamp lights mounted around the walls of the cave suddenly started 
flashing. A siren went off and all the scientists and advisors below 
halted in their actions. Soon afterwards a mechanical voice started 
addressing all people in the St. Mary&#39;s Base through the speakers of the 
intercom. It said monotonously;

&quot;Warning. This base is under attack. Please proceed to the nearest 
shelter. Warning. This base is under attack. Please proceed to the 
nearest shelter. Warning. This base is under attack. Please proceed to 
the nearest shelter. Warning. This base is under attack. Please proceed 
to the nearest shelter.&quot;

And so on.

&quot;We&#39;re under attack?!&quot; Aratia barked in confusion, &quot;By who?&quot;

Diana wasted no time in finding up and walked over (with a surprisingly 
casual stride) to the far wall of that balcony. A computer terminal was 
fixed into the cave wall for people to work from on the move. Diana 
tapped in a few codes while Aratia jogged up to see what was going on. 
The computer screen flashed on and revealed the scene that was taking 
place outside on ground level. A red suit styled in the form of Japanese 
armour was flying towards the northern runway of the compound. A blast 
came from one of its wrist Qi cannons that blasted the front wall of the 
triangular shaped base.

&quot;Hey, that suit... kinda looks like my Hanuman...&quot; But once she got over 
the initial surprise of that, Aratia socked her fist into her palm, &quot;but 
what the hell, yeah? I&#39;ve been looking for a little action anyway! Lets 
see what these bastards can do!&quot;

With that said, Aratia ran off to the lift, obviously to make it to the 
Meta Suit Hanger. But Diana remained as she was. And she just stared at 
the screen before her. With the image of that red Meta Suit on the 
attack. 

Diana&#39;s calm face pulled a small but knowing smile. &quot;The Bishamon M-4. 
That must mean that TH-C4 is here. Excellent. Then that should suggest 
that the woman known as Yumi Mishima won&#39;t be too far behind him. My 
plan is already in motion.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Bishamon M-4 zoomed in towards the St. Mary&#39;s Base from the skies with 
its sword sheathed and its wrist extended outwardly. On the surface of 
the base, the roof, small compartments opened up. And then out from 
those compartments came rather large double-barrel energy cannons. The 
certain defences of the building. After taking a few moments to charge 
themselves for the attack, those cannons started firing in the 
Bishamon&#39;s direction. The suit veered upwards and climbed higher the 
moment that the gunfire was coming in its direction. Bishamon M-4 sailed 
over that gunfire and peeled over into a second descending arc. It 
pushed out its right arm this time and the compartment of its wrist 
opened. A barrel of its own slowly came up from the indentation and 
gathered energy. Seconds later it fired a compressed but extremely 
powerful beam shot in the direction of those roof-blasters. The blast 
from the Bishamon&#39;s Wrist Cannon vaulted down and collided with that 
section of the three-pointed roof. The following explosion destroyed a 
good twenty units of the roof-blasters. Bishamon retracted its Wrist 
Cannon and flew over that now smoking section of the roof and climbed 
upwards again in an arc. Once it reached the pinnacle of that arc, the 
red mecha curved around again. Its shoulder plates of armour were lifted 
from their normal position and the turrets for its Shoulder Gatlings 
came out. The twin Gatlings started firing hundreds of bullets down at 
the roof of the St. Mary&#39;s Base. Triggering off explosions on the places 
which happened to be connected to the electrical systems of the joint. 
Though the place was a mix of scientific production and military 
shipment in theory; its defences weren&#39;t completely elaborate. The 
Gatlings of its shoulders were returned to their concealed position 
under the shoulder armour plates. 

From the innards of the Bishamon&#39;s cockpit, Terry laughed dryly; his 
hands held tightly around the control sticks. &quot;Man, is this it? Is this 
what they&#39;re keeping the Oriax in? Or maybe they&#39;re not taking us 
seriously...&quot;

A set of double-barrel roof-cannons began emerging from the southern 
edge of the triangular base&#39;s roof. Right below the Bishamon itself they 
started gathering energy for a second attack. Terry saw this soon enough 
and commanded his suit to bolt to the right. A swift action which caused 
the Bishamon to avoid a huge rising surge of laser fire. Bright lights 
of haunting emerald cut through the sunny morning sky while the Bishamon 
dodged around them. 

Which elicited another smile from Terry. &quot;...Now that&#39;s more like it!&quot;

While the Bishamon M-4 went at it with the mounted defences of the base, 
a rugged desert-terrain jeep leapt out from the bushes behind the layout 
of the compound. It tumbled to the dust tracks leading into the southern 
end of the runway. Just fifty metres behind the southern end of the St. 
Mary&#39;s Base. Three people were riding inside it. Tomoko (at the wheel), 
Dr. Geist Fahlem (riding aside her) and Yumi (in back). The jeep drove 
straight ahead at the base while Bishamon M-4 provided the perfect 
distraction at the northern end of St. Mary&#39;s.  

Tomoko yelled out to be heard through the wind resistance, which blew at 
her short-hair, &quot;Terry&#39;s got &#39;um good and occupied!&quot;

&quot;Will he be okay on his own!?&quot; Yumi yelled.

&quot;He&#39;ll be fine!&quot; Fahlem assured, &quot;That suit he is in is powerful enough 
to cope with St. Mary&#39;s defences! Now Tomoko! Keep us steady!&quot;

&quot;Gotcha!&quot;

With that said, Fahlem started to pull himself up from the front 
passenger seat of the jeep. His eyes looked through his glasses to the 
large door at the back wall of the base. That was what they would need 
to get through. He stood up while Tomoko drove onwards. And then he put 
both of his hands together to make a sort of triangle-shape between 
them. Geist focused all his mind and power on the space between them. 
And suddenly his body was set aflame with bright sapphire spirit energy. 
Yumi looked on with surprise while Fahlem directed his mind and eyes to 
that door that was in their way. Then he thrust both hands forwards 
whilst yelling; &#39;Shouhaken!&#39; into the air. A burst of Qi force shot from 
his hands in spherical proportion and darted through the particles of 
the air. It rammed into the southern door of the compound and blew 
opened its double-metal existence. Both iron doors were ripped from 
their thick hinges while a cloud of smoke spread out from the blast 
point. Tomoko&#39;s jeep drove straight through that cloud of smoke and 
screeched to a halt once inside the base itself. Fahlem swiftly leapt 
out from the passenger side with his sword in hand. Yumi and Tomoko did 
the same, though the captain of the Kamiyashiki grabbed a pistol she 
happened to have brought with her.  An automatic door in the right wall 
opened and three unarmed security guards came running out of it to 
expect the explosion. Geist rushed forwards with almost inhuman speed 
and swiftly withdrew his blade. With three great yells of &#39;ha!&#39; and 
three subsequent strokes with the sword after each, those three security 
guards went down amidst blood and bloody sight. Fahlem sheathed his 
katana and sighed, then turned back around to see Yumi and Tomoko across 
from him by a computer terminal.

Tomoko watched as Yumi started typing at the keys of the computer. &quot;What 
are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Finding out where the Oriax is,&quot; Yumi told her sharply, &quot;In my old days 
I used to do this sort of thing a lot. We can&#39;t waste time searching 
when Terry is out there risking his life for me. I can do this quickly 
if... I&#39;ve got it!&quot;

Fahlem ran up to the pair of them. &quot;Where is it?&quot;

&quot;Sub floor B3,&quot; Yumi told him, &quot;We can get to it from here - using the 
lift.&quot;

And that was that. Yumi, Tomoko, and Fahlem ran to the lift from the 
computer terminal. All the while they could hear the explosion from the 
Bishamon&#39;s fight with the St Mary&#39;s Base defences up above. The metal 
doors to the lift opened for them a few seconds later. All three ran 
inside and let the doors close behind them. Tomoko then set the lift to 
take them down to sub floor B3, where the Oriax would be. The lift went 
downwards and descended to the lowest level of the base. No more than 
two minutes later the pulleys for the lift reach their lowest ebb and 
the automatic doors for the lift parted for them. Yumi, Tomoko and 
Fahlem ran out into the ground level of sub floor B3. A short distance 
ahead of them was the Oriax. But unfortunately the doors to the lift 
were surrounded by eleven armoured security guards. And each of them 
were armed with laser rifles. Yumi, Fahlem and Tomoko froze in place 
when each of those men aimed their guns at the trio.

&quot;...Ah shit...&quot; Tomoko seethed, &quot;...we&#39;re caught.&quot;

Geist kept a hand on his katana hilt. &quot;Just don&#39;t make any sudden 
moves.&quot;

&quot;Well, well, well!&quot; A female voice called out to the three, &quot;Doctor 
Geist Fahlem. I would never expect you to be the type to associate 
yourself with bounty hunters...&quot;

The group of armed security guards parted down the middle of their line 
of order. Diana Katrianna walked through that opening and stepped up to 
the three intruders with a calm smile that was somewhat of a trademark 
for her. &quot;That is not the kind of conduct I would expect from the future 
successor to Caliph Bahaman.&quot;

Fahlem&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Diana Katrianna...&quot;

&quot;Diana Katrianna?&quot; Yumi mimicked absently, &quot;that&#39;s the woman that was 
behind the Sohei Project...?&quot;

&quot;...The Sohei Project? So you have already heard of me, have you? I am 
honoured,&quot; The tall woman turned her gaze to Yumi. Diana stared at the 
girl for a brief few moments, then waved her hand to the guards, &quot;stand 
down. These three shall be taken into my custody. Go ahead support the 
ground level troops.&quot;

Though they didn&#39;t like it, the eleven guards stationed at the lift 
nodded to Diana&#39;s commands and were dismissed. They all marched to that 
lift and entered it; to take themselves to the upper levels of the 
compound. This left only Diana and the three intruders inside that 
gigantic underground cave. Tomoko reached into her gun holster and aimed 
at the woman. 

&quot;That wasn&#39;t a smart move,&quot; Said Tomoko with a grin, &quot;there&#39;s no one to 
protect you now. Not that I&#39;m not grateful or anything.&quot;

Diana simply smiled at that. &quot;...Shooting me will do you no good. My 
life is not important enough for that to make any difference. I let them 
go so that we could speak without impediment. The Ragnarok System cannot 
detect us here... so we are free to converse.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t come here for tea and a chat!&quot; Tomoko shouted.

Fahlem re-attached his katana to his waist. &quot;Please calm yourself, 
Tomoko. I think we should hear what Diana has to say to us.&quot;

The captain scowled at that. &quot;Are you kidding me?&quot;

&quot;...He&#39;s right...&quot; Yumi agreed, &quot;...please, Tomoko?&quot;

It seemed as if Yumi&#39;s pleas had somewhat of an effect on the 
dark-haired woman. She slotted her gun back into its holster and crossed 
her arms, relenting at that stance. &quot;Alright, alright. I suppose I&#39;m 
being paid for this anyways. Let her talk.&quot;

Diana nodded to the three of them. &quot;Follow me, please.&quot;

The white-coat dressed female turned her back to them and started 
walking. Yumi, Tomoko and Fahlem followed her. The group strode over the 
expanse of that large cave, their footsteps echoing in its vastness. 
They came to a small side room that had been constructed into the very 
face of the cave wall. Diana took out a key from her pocket and slotted 
it into the keyhole of the door. She opened it and entered, leaving the 
door open for the other three to enter. Fahlem and Tomoko did just that. 
But Yumi took one last look at the Oriax before doing so. Once all three 
were inside, Diana closed the door and walked up to one of the tables 
laid out over the room. She pressed her hands down on it then stared at 
the group across from her with another of those chillingly composed 
smiles.

&quot;I am glad you agreed to this,&quot; She said, &quot;It is often hard to speak 
with the people here in the St. Mary&#39;s Base. They are too full of awe 
for me. There are times when it is nice to talk with someone who has an 
objective point of view towards you.&quot;

Geist locked eyes with her. &quot;When did you return from Meshezabel?&quot;

&quot;No more than two days ago,&quot; She answered, &quot;you must have learned about 
the malfunction in the Ragnarok System. I was ordered by Control Central 
to fix it. And though it interfered with my plans... I think it was 
quite... beneficial in the long run.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot; Asked the other scientist.

&quot;I now know that Meshezabel&#39;s defences and protective systems are a lot 
stronger than most people realize. But that in itself is a fact I should 
have known from the beginning, because all those defences are centred 
around the Ragnarok System. Thus revealing Meshezabel&#39;s biggest and only 
true weakness.&quot;

Fahlem&#39;s ebony eyes narrowed at that. &quot;I knew it. You bear nothing more 
than resentment for the Ashurian Empire, just as we do. What are you 
planning, Diana? What do you think you can accomplish? And for what 
reason do you seek to pursue this course?&quot;

&quot;Would it make any great difference if you knew my reasons? You never 
broke any of your ties to the nation of Geshem as you seemed to imply to 
Queen Ashura and the Triad of the Inquisition. I don&#39;t ask you for those 
reasons because they don&#39;t matter. All that matters is that we share a 
common enemy. Is that not so?&quot;

Yumi blinked. &quot;But what does that have to do with the Oriax?&quot;

Diana looked from Fahlem over to Yumi and settled her gaze there. &quot;Yumi 
Mishima, I presume?&quot;

&quot;...Yes...&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; The older woman adjusted her glasses, &quot;you are the pilot of the 
Oriax. A former member of the past Chrysalis and a citizen of the 
legendary Meta Tokyo. Not to mention the slayer of Captain Kraepelin and 
the Eon as well as Freeman Ronove and his Raum Meta Suit. I am most 
honoured to finally meet you.&quot;

Yumi was shocked. &quot;You know all that? Are... you an Ishtar like myself 
and Doctor Fahlem? Is that how you know?!&quot;

&quot;...Ishtar?&quot; Tomoko wondered. 

Diana shook her head at that. &quot;No. I am not an Ishtar. Though like you 
and Geist, I have lived for thousands of years. I am fully aware of the 
legacy of the Astaroth as well as the Novus Deus. Yet there is another 
supernatural force I am privy to. That almighty being; the one known as 
&#39;Seraphiel&#39;.&quot;

The gears were turning in Fahlem&#39;s mind. &quot;...Ah. Now I see. That was why 
you finally commissioned the excavation of the Oriax. I do not know how 
you talked Gustav K&#148;hler into it... and I do not know why the Triad of 
the Inquisition would have allowed it to take place... but it was 
Seraphiel that you were after all along, was it not?&quot;

&quot;Right as always, Doctor,&quot; Diana said with a nod, &quot;The Earth&#39;s Original. 
The being that was shaped of our planet&#39;s life-force. What I do is 
nothing more than that of its own will. All I ask from it is one small 
price. That price shall be paid to me when the time comes.&quot;

Fahlem stared at her. &quot;What is it you want, Diana? The destruction of 
the Ashurian Empire?&quot;

&quot;Please. Once my plans take form such an organization will mean nothing. 
I have already entered stage three of my plans. From now on what will 
happen next depends on you.&quot;

Tomoko frowned. &quot;And what the hell is that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;Exactly as I have said,&quot; Replied the scientist, &quot;now that the Oriax has 
been freed from the ice of South Shidou; all eyes will be on the one you 
call Lune White. She is the focus from now on. And she is with you, 
correct?&quot;

&quot;Lune? What&#39;s so special about Lune?&quot; Asked Tomoko. 

Diana turned her smile back to Yumi. &quot;...I suppose... in a way... you 
could refer to her as Miss Mishima&#39;s... descendant.&quot;

And now Yumi was also beginning to understand what it was that Diana was 
getting at. &quot;...Wait... you mean...?&quot;

&quot;Yes. That girl called Lune White... is this generation&#39;s Eros.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

While Bishamon M-4 continued to battle it out against the laser cannons 
that were mounted on top of the roof of the St. Mary&#39;s Base, one of the 
large metal doors to its front opened slowly. Standing behind those 
doors was the Meta Suit of Aratia de Toscana; the Hanuman. In its hand 
was its weapon. An elongated Energy Naginata. With no more waiting for 
it to give the Hanuman turned on its thrusters and bolted up into the 
air. It flew around in an arc motion and veered towards the attacking 
Bishamon. The steel blade of the Naginata in its hand crackled with an 
electrical energy that had been converted from Aratia&#39;s Qi via the 
Hanuman&#39;s Qi Generator. But rather than attack with that outright, the 
&#39;ear&#39; proportions on the suit reverted backwards to revealed twin Head 
Gatlings. A chain of bullets was unleashed in the Bishamon&#39;s direction. 
When the red mecha destroyed the last of the roof-cannons, it was too 
late to dodge them. The bullets nailed the Bishamon across its torso and 
stomach, leaving it slightly damaged in part from the waist. It quickly 
zoomed upwards to escape the path of fire before anymore damage was 
done.

Once the Bishamon reached a height that the Hanuman&#39;s rapid fire 
capabilities could not reach, Terry looked through his cockpit video 
screen at the one attacking him. &quot;Wait a minute. That suit... kinda 
looks like mine. But how can that be? I thought that Bishamon was a 
custom model.&quot;

Then Terry opened communications with the pilot of Hanuman via a private 
link. &quot;Hey you! Who are you?!&quot;

&quot;A woman you won&#39;t soon forget,&quot; Aratia chuckled from her cockpit, &quot;I am 
Aratia de Toscana!&quot;

Terry mused on that. &quot;...Aratia. I&#39;ve heard of you. You&#39;re a member of 
the Shinjinkai; those three highest ranked Meta Suit pilots in the 
Schutzenreich military. I was wondering when I&#39;d get to tangle with 
someone like you.&quot;

Aratia continued laughing. &quot;You really think you&#39;re up for it?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s like one of my old friend said, whether win or lose, you&#39;ll 
never know until you try!&quot;

The Bishamon swiftly descended towards the Hanuman. The Hanuman twirled 
around its Naginata into a horizontal position to defend against the 
incoming attack. The Bishamon reached behind its back and pulled out the 
sword it had positioned there. It was unsheathed and clashed down upon 
the Naginata with one stroke. The force from the collision between their  
weapons let off thin but forceful ripples through the air. Ones that 
blew back into the Hanuman&#39;s decorative mane of rust-gold hair. 

Terry gazed at video screen in his cockpit.  The readings he was getting 
were pretty intense. &quot;Damn! That girl&#39;s got a Qi-Level of 8,400?!&quot;

There was a sudden push from the Naginata in its double-handed grip. It 
batted the katana of the Bishamon right off and forced the red mecha 
itself to withdraw from that position. Hanuman followed that up with a 
charge. Both metallic hands of the suit gripped the pole of the Energy 
Naginata when it swept around at the Bishamon with a half-circle slice. 
Terry&#39;s suit zoomed backwards from that blow to avoid it. Then launched 
forwards to attempt to slice down upon the now unguarded Hanuman. But 
that blow was forcefully repelled when a spherical Qi shield came into 
being around the body of the Hanuman. The katana couldn&#39;t even dent it. 
Bishamon flew back on the force of the thrusters and circled around 
Hanuman.

&quot;Damnit!&quot; Terry cursed, &quot;A Qi Shield?&quot;

Once again the haughty teen woman Aratia chuckled derisively. &quot;Heh, heh, 
heh. And just what did you expect?&quot;

The shoulder plates on the Bishamon opened up again. The Shoulder 
Gatlings on the mecha came outwards with their power aimed at the shield 
that now surrounded Aratia&#39;s Meta Suit. The rain of bullets began no 
more than a second later and they were fired continuously at the Qi 
Barrier. Those bullets did nothing. Slight indentations were caused when 
the bullets were fired into its presence. But those bullets were pushed 
off it and they plummeted downwards by force of gravity. They couldn&#39;t 
have broken through that shield. The Bishamon soon ended its blasts at 
the shield. The smoking turrets then returned methodically to their 
positions inside the suit. 

Terry frowned. &quot;...Shit. Bullets can&#39;t pierce that thing either, huh?&quot;

There was no warning as the Hanuman regressed its Qi Barrier and rushed 
forwards on its thrusters towards the Bishamon. It prepared its Naginata 
and came at the red mecha with a single blow. One that was so swift that 
Terry could barely pick up on it. The Naginata smashed into the skull of 
the Bishamon itself, instantly cracking the right &#39;eye&#39; of the suit, 
effecting its camera vision. The Bishamon swung its katana back up and 
deflected the incoming second strike. The two weapons clashed with one 
and other again. But the superiority of the Hanuman was shining through 
on this occasion. Once again it took only one push from Aratia&#39;s suit to 
knock the Bishamon out of another weapon lock. And with that opening 
Hanuman delivered one final blow to the chest, striking down with force. 
Flame, electricity and smoke burst up from the damage point, a huge tear 
across the exoskeleton of the Bishamon. And the Terry&#39;s suit plummeted 
out of the sky. It crash landed straight into one of the side walls of 
the St. Mary&#39;s Base, breaking open its stone confides and crushing the 
ground beneath it. Inside the cockpit, Terry groaned, the impact of the 
fall taking its toll on him as well. &quot;Man, that woman is powerful...&quot; 

He tugged at the control sticks to get the Bishamon moving. Although it 
could adjust the position of its legs slightly, it wouldn&#39;t get up from 
the large crater that it had created inside the base&#39;s wall. &quot;...C&#39;mon, 
Bishamon. Don&#39;t quit on me now.&quot;

In the skies above the Bishamon&#39;s crash site was the Hanuman. Inside its 
cockpit Aratia laughed with amusement. &quot;Heh, heh, heh! That wasn&#39;t half 
bad, considering. Not many pilots can last that long against someone 
like me. You should be proud. But now it&#39;s over.&quot;

The Hanuman shifted its Naginata back and tilted its head downwards as 
if it were attempting to dive down. But then the scanners of the Hanuman 
picked up on something. Aratia released one of the control sticks and 
pressed a button on her control panel to bring up the detection. Nestled 
in the forests to the south of the St. Mary&#39;s Base was the great 
battleship; Kamiyashiki. The Hanuman&#39;s readings had confirmed it. And 
the thermal image placed on Aratia&#39;s video screen displayed its 
existence.

Aratia&#39;s smiled widened. &quot;...Ah! The people on that ship must be working 
with that guy. And since the only thing of worth here that anyone should 
know about is the Oriax... that must mean... that the pilot of the 
Oriax, that girl we found in the ice... she must be here. And if she is 
here... then so is the other one. Heh, heh, heh! Oh you cute little 
bastards made one big mistake in coming here! Now I can kill two birds 
with one stone!&quot;

The thrusters on the Hanuman kicked off. And it bolted at the south 
towards the bushes. Terry could see what Aratia was going for but could 
do nothing about it, either. The Bishamon&#39;s Zero Gravity Movement 
capabilities were shot from that last attack. The Hanuman continued on 
regardless and veered over the forests in which the Kamiyashiki had 
hidden itself from view. The Hanuman came to a stop when it was directly 
above the battleship and instantly opened communications with those on 
board. 

&quot;Hear me!&quot; She yelled, &quot;I am Aratia de Toscana! The first of the 
Shinjinkai Combat Team and a soldier of the Ashurian Empire! I know that 
an item of our possession is inside that ship! The girl called Lune 
White! Hand her over immediately or I while destroy that ship myself!&quot;

In the bridge of the Kamiyashiki, Lune stood alone on the platform that 
was usually reserved for its forgone captain. Neela, Suzuhara and Skye; 
the helmsmen and helmswomen of the Kamiyashiki, were all manning their 
computers around the front curve of the room. On the big frontal video 
screen they could see the image of the Hanuman hovering above them with 
that destructive Energy Naginata in hand. Aratia&#39;s declaration went out 
across the entire forest but was heard the loudest on the ship&#39;s bridge. 
Lune looked on fearfully. She had just known such slight freedom after 
years of imprisonment... 

Suzuhara looked up at Lune. &quot;...She... wants you, Lune...&quot;

&quot;...Me?&quot;

Neela shook her head. &quot;We can&#39;t give her to them. Part of our orders in 
this mission was to protect Lune, right?&quot;

&quot;...I know,&quot; Suzuhara said, &quot;...but...&quot;

Lune shook her head, ending their discussion. It was a tough choice for 
her but she couldn&#39;t be so selfish as to sacrifice the Kamiyashiki 
because of her fear of re-imprisonment. &quot;No. It&#39;s okay. Please don&#39;t 
worry about me. I will... accept her offer. I&#39;ll go with her.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Lune is the new Eros?&quot; Yumi asked, dumbfounded. 

Diana nodded to the former Eros with her hands slotted into the pockets 
of her white coat. &quot;Yes. That girl Lune White is the current Eros. Her 
embryo was sent to what is left of the former nation of Xu; the Islands 
of Baan, after the last failed attempt to give birth to a new Novus 
Deus. Somehow it survived the pandemonium caused when Deathcatcher 
instigated the destruction of Xu. Then seventeen years ago it matured 
into its humanoid state. The girl was found by villagers and then taken 
in. When our armies were sent to obtain more test subjects for 
experimentation, that girl was taken. All the way up to Meshezabel. 
However once her readings were analysed it became clear that she was 
more than ordinary. And upon further research it was revealed that she 
was Eros. When she turned five she was shipped to the South Shidou 
Investigate Research Station where she has been ever since. Until you 
escaped with her, that is.&quot;

Yumi turned to Geist. &quot;Did you know about this?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; He said, &quot;It is true. Lune is this generation&#39;s Eros.&quot;

Tomoko spread her hands open. &quot;What the hell are you all talking about? 
What on earth is an Eros?&quot;

Diana continued, stating; &quot;Until now it has not been important. When 
fate was re-written due to the failure of Yumi Mishima to produce the 
Novus Deus, the Anthropos era was not the only concept to be effected. 
That day changed the vocation of the Eros-Thanatos Cycle. Not only was 
it accelerated but it re-wrote the pre-destined hopes of the old race. 
Novus Deus will be born upon the 100th union of the Eros and Thanatos, 
as one of the Tablets of Destiny states, if the 41st union is 
unsuccessful. This means that Lune, assuming that tablet speaks true, 
will give birth to the Novus Deus. There shall be no failure this time.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s insane...&quot; Yumi said, &quot;...how can you... be so sure...?&quot;

The still Diana took off her glasses. &quot;...I assume you know what the 
Heart of the Astaroth is. The fact that you underwent Divine Hibernation 
proves that much. However there is no explanation as to why an Eros like 
you, a descendant of a so-called &#39;God&#39;, can achieve that level. It has 
been theorized that the impurity that killed Novus Deus and gave birth 
to Astaroth is still plaguing the bloodline that you belong to, Miss 
Mishima. In which case, that must be the cause of your ability to 
achieve a Complete Gnosis and become an Ishtar. Knowing that the skill 
of melding with the Heart of Astaroth is a trait belonging only to 
impure members of the bloodline... we performed tests on Lune. And there 
is absolutely no indication that she has the ability to achieve 
symbiosis.&quot;

Fahlem looked on. &quot;...So she is...?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Lune White is the first pure-blooded Eros ever. She is free from 
the taint of the Second Sin. Therefore it is certain that she will give 
birth to a new Novus Deus.&quot;

Yumi&#39;s heart started racing. &quot;...But that means... that...&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Diana already knew what she was saying, &quot;once the Novus Deus is 
born and regains its full power it will attempt to restore humanity to 
its Bio-System state. All human begins shall be fused into a sole 
condition. Under the direction of the Triad of the Inquisition, of 
course. Only those in this plane of existence will be subject to it. 
Which also excludes Caliph Bahaman and the people of Geshem, does it 
not?&quot;

Though Tomoko didn&#39;t understand a single thing that was being said here, 
she knew that it didn&#39;t seem to be a good thing. Though Fahlem had 
another question for Diana, &quot;But what of the Thanatos? Have you located 
him?&quot;

Diana nodded. &quot;Yes. And that&#39;s the biggest point of it all. He was found 
years ago and kept on Meshezabel. When he reached puberty, samples of 
his semen were taken from him. Those semen samples were placed inside 
nano-molecular capsules that were attached to Lune&#39;s ovum more than four 
years ago. Once she reaches her eighteenth birthday those capsules will 
dissolve and her egg will be fertilized almost instantaneously. The 
Triad are taking no risks this time.&quot;

&quot;...We... can&#39;t let this happen!&quot; Argued Yumi, &quot;How do we stop it?&quot;

The older woman addressed Yumi. &quot;...There are only two ways to stop it. 
One would be to remove the nano-capsules inside of the girl before her 
eighteenth birthday. But it would take Meshezablian technology of the 
highest calibre to do that.&quot;

&quot;And the other way?&quot; Asked Tomoko.

&quot;Kill her.&quot;

Shared looks of worry and paranoia crossed the faces of Yumi, Tomoko and 
Fahlem. This whole thing had developed from something bad to something 
worse. But Diana was totally unfazed. She only smiled at the three of 
them. &quot;Quite a sticky situation you find yourselves in, eh?&quot;

&quot;...Why are you so calm about this, Diana?&quot; Geist asked, &quot;The same fate 
will befall you if the Novus Deus is reborn, surely you realize that?&quot;

Again, Diana only smiled that off. &quot;Doctor Fahlem. For one I have 
admired for so long... you do tend to forget things, don&#39;t you? My plan 
involves the birth of the Novus Deus. I want it to arise.&quot;

&quot;And what will you do if it does?&quot; Yumi asked her. 

The scientist looked over to the door. &quot;...You will learn that soon 
enough. I know what you came here for. The Oriax. For you to take it is 
also part of my plan. So it is yours, Yumi Mishima. Beside your Oriax is 
a weapon that I designed myself. The &#39;Kaiser Halberd&#39; it has been 
called. You may take that as well.&quot;

Tomoko still didn&#39;t trust her. &quot;What about this &#39;plan&#39; of yours? Why are 
you helping us?&quot;

&quot;Your objectives and mine are the same right now,&quot; Diana answered, &quot;that 
may change soon... but for now we are not enemies. When we next meet... 
it shall be different. Now go. The Ragnarok System is due to come online 
in less than an hour. If you do not leave by then, the scanners of the 
Gospel Template will trace you. So you must leave.&quot;

That was the thought that got them moving. Though Yumi still thought 
that there was more that Diana was... keeping from them, they could not 
linger here. Yumi, Fahlem and Tomoko exited through the door. Diana 
watched them leave with her cold smile but said nothing. Yumi ran out 
into the cave again with her two companions taking up her rear. Over to 
the Oriax she went. Once she got to its feet she stopped and focused her 
powers. A large golden aura of silver Qi sprung up around her torso. In 
a flash she transported herself from the ground into the watery 
dimensional cockpit. Her body landed in the cockpit&#39;s seat. When she did 
everything came online again. The lights and buttons all alight by her 
presence. In all ways... the Oriax was connected to Yumi. And she was 
connected to the Oriax. The Meta Suit started moving once under Yumi&#39;s 
control and it kneeled down slowly. The Oriax extended its hand out for 
Geist and Tomoko to ride on. &quot;Get on! But hold on tight!&quot;

They both nodded and climbed onto the white metallic hand of the Oriax. 
Once Fahlem and Tomoko were on and were safely holding onto it, the 
Oriax stood upright from its kneeling position. Then Yumi gazed at the 
Kaiser Halberd that Diana had told her about.

Yumi called out to Fahlem from the mouth speakers of the Oriax. &quot;Doctor! 
Should I take that thing?&quot;

&quot;Diana gave it to you!&quot; Fahlem yelled to be heard, &quot;It is your weapon! I 
do not think it is a trap! Just use it with caution until I have a 
chance to analyse it on the Kamiyashiki!&quot;

Yumi nodded to that in the cockpit and the Oriax reached out to grab the 
Kaiser Halberd by its hilt. The moment she did the Elohim Program fused 
in action with the Soul Gear Engine of the suit, giving the Oriax full 
control over its use. And there was no time like the present to use it. 
The Oriax aimed the Kaiser Halberd upwards. The upper-casing of its 
separated in part; disclosing a thick and elongated blade. The 
operations of the Elohim Program worked with both the Soul Gear Engine 
and the Oriax&#39;s connections to Yumi&#39;s mindset. Therefore the Rail Gun 
mode was activated instantly as a reflex action. Black lightning energy 
surrounded the blade between the indentation of the casing. Like static 
crackling between two points of a tuning fork. Then a thunderous and 
earth-splitting beam of pure negative energy burst up from the blade and 
shot upwards. That blast wave of power burned through the roof of the 
cave and smashed its way through each level of the St. Mary&#39;s Base, 
wiping out anything in its way. Just until that beam broke through into 
the outside, ripping upwards from the roof of the compound. 

The Oriax flew upwards by the horsepower of the thrusters. It soared up 
through the hole it had just carved through the base with the Kaiser 
Halberd; until it made it outside. Once the sunlight finally descended 
on the Oriax, Yumi could see the Hanuman Meta Suit. Reflexively, Yumi 
commanded the Oriax to aim the Kaiser Halberd at it. 

&quot;Are you working for the Ashurian Empire?&quot; Yumi asked.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do that if I were you,&quot; A VDU with Aratia&#39;s face from the 
cockpit of the Hanuman appeared on Yumi&#39;s video screen, &quot;you&#39;re Yumi 
Mishima, correct?  You should know that have your friend with me.&quot;

Yumi&#39;s sky blue eyes widened when she saw Lune in the back of Aratia&#39;s 
cockpit. &quot;Lune!&quot;

Aratia laughed at the reaction. &quot;Heh, heh, heh! That&#39;s right. I have the 
girl. If you try to stop me now... she will be killed in the crossfire. 
I&#39;m taking her to Aryahm now. Do with that outdated suit as you please. 
But if you try to follow me... I will kill her. Do you read me, girl?&quot;

Yumi clenched her teeth. She didn&#39;t want to leave Lune with that woman. 
But at the same time she had no choice. Killing them both now would be 
easy. And it would solve the Novus Deus problem once and for all. But 
could she ever live with herself knowing that she killed and innocent 
girl just because of circumstances she wasn&#39;t even aware of? Yumi could 
not do that. The Oriax lowered the Kaiser Halberd. 

&quot;Good girl,&quot; Aratia blew a kiss to the constrained Yumi via their video 
screen communication, &quot;next time we get together I promise to give you a 
good fight. Until then!&quot;

The Hanuman then bolted around and flew off towards the north with its 
thrusters at maximum capacity. Which left a confused Yumi, a damaged 
Bishamon, and a ruined base behind in its wake. Geist held Tomoko so 
that they would not fall from the Oriax&#39;s hand while it flew. He was the 
one thinking hardest about all this. But no matter what way you looked 
at it... the fundamental problem was still the same. Lune was this 
generation&#39;s Eros. But if they couldn&#39;t stop her from giving birth... 
then it was over. But what could they do?
