<a href="../original/chasers-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Kate looked up at Dr. Alexis Jameson, an odd look on her face. &quot;We were 
out on a case last night, a attempted homicide, and there was an android 
there,&quot; she said quietly.

Alexis tried not to show her surprise, but it was hard. The session had 
started out just like the others with Kate, the police officer just 
sitting there silently on the couch. Then she had tensed up, sat forward 
and began to speak.

&quot;Silver, she called herself,&quot; Kate said softly, &quot;she was there taking 
care of the wounded girl. She knelt there on the pavement, rocking her 
friend back and forth, trying to protect her from anything else with her 
own body.&quot;

Kate stopped, and Alexis wanted to prompt her, but she kept quiet. 
Somehow, the dark haired woman just knew that talking to her would cut 
off whatever was happening here. After a few moments, Kate started up 
again.

&quot;I&#39;ve never believed that androids could care,&quot; Kate said softly, &quot;not 
like a real human being.&quot; She smiled to herself wryly, thinking back to 
the android with the little dog, before saying quietly, &quot;Maybe I was 
wrong.&quot;

Alexis quietly said, &quot;And if you are?&quot;

Kate sighed softly, &quot;Then maybe I need to think about why I&#39;m doing 
this.&quot;

Alexis looked at Kate, and knew that she wasn&#39;t ready to talk about this 
any longer. Deciding to try to keep her talking she asked, &quot;What do you 
think of the people you work with?&quot; Kate looked at her thoughtfully for 
a few moments, and Alexis wondered if she was going to answer her at 
all.

Kate puffed out a little breath, &quot;My co-workers?&quot; She smiled slightly, 
looking thoughtful, &quot;Gwen is the boss, and she makes it quite clear 
about that. But she&#39;s also human...&quot;

Kate had been sitting in her office, when she saw Gwen hurry by her 
office in much disarray. Her clothes were messy, her hair unkempt, and 
her face showed signs of crying. Up the hallway she heard the office 
door open and slam shut, and figured Gwen was in there.

After a few moments of silence, Kate ventured up the hallway and firmly 
knocked on the door. &quot;Go &#39;way!&quot; was the shouted reply.

&quot;It&#39;s me, Kate,&quot; Kate answered. There was a few moments of silence, and 
Kate took that as permission to go in. Gwen looked a bit neater, and had 
changed to her suit, but she still looked pretty terrible. Her eyes were 
red rimmed, and bags showed her lack of sleep.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Gwen asked tiredly.

&quot;If you want,&quot; Kate said quietly, &quot;I can cover for you today.&quot; She 
tugged on the chair in front of Gwen&#39;s desk and settled down into it 
smoothly.

Gwen pushed her hair back tiredly, looking down at her desk. &quot;I look 
that bad, do I?&quot; she asked Kate quietly.

&quot;You&#39;ve looked better,&quot; Kate answered diplomatically, getting a smile 
from Gwen. Quietly she asked, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind my asking, what&#39;s 
wrong?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll probably find out from the rumor mill soon enough,&quot; Gwen sighed 
sadly, &quot;my girlfriend is leaving me.&quot;

&quot;... I never really expected her to tell me that.&quot; Kate finished 
quietly, not noticing Alexis&#39; nearly bone pale face.

&#39;Did my leaving Gwen effect her that much?&#39; a badly shaken Alexis found 
herself wondering. &#39;Kate couldn&#39;t know that it&#39;s me that Gwen was 
talking about,&#39; she thought.

&quot;Beth,&quot; Kate paused, and laughed softly, &quot;Beth is just over the top. 
She&#39;s incredible with all the computer stuff, but off work...&quot;

Kate looked at Beth oddly. The petite little redhead had been wearing a 
long coat throughout her shift today, explaining that she was wearing 
her &#39;clubbing&#39; outfit underneath it. Personally, Kate didn&#39;t see the big 
deal, but then again she usually only wore a T-shirt and pants anyway.

&quot;Ready for the unveiling?&quot; Beth asked her with a grin.

Kate shrugged nonchalantly, &quot;Sure.&quot;

Beth opened her coat and Kate nearly sprayed her with a mouthful of 
coffee! Over a black body stocking she was wearing a red corset, 
panties, stockings and boots, along with elbow length red gloves. Still 
coughing on her coffee Kate managed, &quot;You&#39;re going to get arrested!&quot;

Beth grinned and answered eagerly, &quot;You think so?&quot; She paused, taking a 
sexy pose, &quot;You could always keep me here.&quot;

Kate groaned softly, &quot;You know you&#39;re not my type!&quot;

Beth pouted, &quot;You can&#39;t blame a girl for trying.&quot; She pulled her long 
coat around her and headed out with a spring in her step.

A smiling Lynn poked her blonde head in the room to ask Kate, &quot;Was she 
wearing what I think she was wearing?&quot;

Kate shook her head, &quot;Yep.&quot;

There was a long pause in the storytelling, an odd expression appearing 
on Kate&#39;s face. Her eyes had darkened in memory, and she looked down at 
the clasped hands in her lap. &quot;Lynn?&quot; Alexis prompted her gently.

&quot;I&#39;m not ready,&quot; Kate said softly, &quot;to talk about Lynn.&quot;

Alexis really wanted to push, but decided to move along instead. &quot;Don&#39;t 
you have another co-worker?&quot; she asked.

Kate sat there a few moments silently, then said, &quot;Jen is my new 
partner.&quot; A ghost of a smile, &quot;The rookie is always neat, dressed for 
success. Well, except for that one time...

&quot;I can&#39;t believe my mother!&quot; Jen shouted, barging right by the three 
standing and talking.

Kate looked over at her in surprise. Over the past few weeks she had 
gotten used to seeing Jen come in dressed in a perfectly chosen 
pantsuit, makeup, hair combed and looking a bit like a fashion model. 
Even in an emergency, she came in looking good.

But today, Jen actually had hair standing up. Her suit looked all right, 
but it hadn&#39;t been ironed, and looked pulled on hurriedly. Most 
importantly, Jen looked clearly furious.

&quot;What did your mother do?&quot; Gwen asked her tentatively, wondering if she 
was going to have to call the regular police and report a homicide.

&quot;She set me up for a marriage meeting,&quot; Jen bit out.

&quot;What?&quot; Kate blurted.

Jen began to pace, &quot;She tells me were going out to lunch with an old 
friend of hers, and I find myself sitting across from this poor young 
man and his mom. Then the old granny showed up!&quot;

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Beth asked curiously.

Jen smiled grimly, &quot;I finally came out to my mother, that&#39;s what!&quot; With 
that, she dropped her stuff off at her desk and went to the bathroom to 
tidy up.

Sitting there Kate looked at her watch and her eyes widened. She got up 
off the couch, &quot;Looks like I ran over today, Doc.&quot;

Alexis got up as well, &quot;You can stay longer if you want.&quot; Kate shook her 
head as she strode to the door, and Alexis added, &quot;I hope we can talk 
again next time.&quot;

Kate paused at the open office door, her brown hair falling into her 
eyes. There was a slight smile on her face, &quot;Maybe.&quot; With that, she was 
gone.
