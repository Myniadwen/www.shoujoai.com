<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 13 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/chasers-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>The bar was a surprisingly good one for Lowtown, Kate noted as she went 
inside, feeling the patron&#39;s eyes resting on her. It was both a clean 
bar and a bit cozy, a nice dance floor and a few dining tables. There 
was also karaoke, but she could live with that. She had chosen to skip 
wearing her police jacket, though she did wear her pistol under her 
plain black coat. Looking around her she saw that the customers were all 
women, and smiled slightly.

The woman at the bar looked the sandy brown haired woman over, her own 
long blue hair flowing over her shoulders. &quot;Have you got a license for 
that?&quot; she asked, nodding to the barely visible lump in Kate&#39;s jacket.

&#39;Sharp,&#39; Kate thought admiringly as she slid her wallet from her pocket. 
She opened it up discretely, letting the bartender see the badge.

The woman narrowed her cat&#39;s eyes slightly before she asked Kate, &quot;Are 
you here for business or pleasure?&quot;

&quot;Off-duty,&quot; Kate reassured her, &quot;meeting a friend.&quot;

The bartender relaxed a bit as she asked, &quot;What can I get you?&quot;

&quot;Beer in a bottle, please,&quot; Kate smiled. She paid for it, then turned to 
look out at the crowd for her... date. &#39;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing this,&#39; 
she thought.

She came through the doors a few moments later, her long silvery hair 
flowing around her like the summer dress she wore. She moved gracefully, 
but years of experience confirmed to Kate that she was an android. 
Silver actually smiled on seeing Kate, walking over to her side.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you came,&quot; Silver said quietly as she settled into a spot 
beside Kate at the bar.

&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; Kate flushed a bit, drinking a bit more of her beer. 
&quot;How&#39;s Kari?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Much better,&quot; Silver smiled. She looked up at the bartender and asked, 
&quot;Ryouko, could I have my regular, please?&quot;

&quot;Coming right up,&quot; Ryouko smiled, obviously feeling happier that the 
quiet policewoman was here with one of the good customers.

Kate raised her eyebrow at the glass of murky liquid that was set down 
in front of Silver. &quot;What is that?&quot; she asked.

&quot;A mix of alcohol and a kind of synthetic oil,&quot; Silver shrugged, &quot;it 
tastes good and it&#39;s good for my systems.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll stick with my beer,&quot; Kate answered her dryly.

They stood there silently, enjoying their drinks, when Silver finally 
asked, &quot;Why did you decide to call me?&quot;

Kate put her bottle down, and pushed her brown hair back from her face. 
&quot;To be honest, I&#39;m not entirely sure,&quot; she admitted, &quot;I guess I just 
wanted to talk.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s grab a table,&quot; and Silver gently lay her hand on Kate&#39;s arm.

Kate let Silver tug her along, looking over the women around her 
thoughtfully. Her eyes widened and she smiled, realizing they were 
playing early twenty-first century music.

&quot;How can you look into my eyes, like open doors?&quot; the woman&#39;s recorded 
voice sang to them sweetly.

Without really thinking about it, Kate pulled a chair out for Silver, 
pushing it in after she sat down. &quot;Thank you,&quot; the silvery haired girl 
smiled up at her.

Kate cheeks went just a bit red as she said casually, &quot;No problem.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t run into an old-fashioned gentleman very often these days,&quot; 
Silver teased her gently, &quot;it makes a pleasant change of pace.&quot;

&quot;Just consider me as a throw-back,&quot; Kate answered, thinking of her home, 
the machinery stripped of all of it&#39;s A.I.s.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far,&quot; Silver sipped at her drink delicately, looking 
over at Kate with her blue-gray eyes. Quietly, &quot;What would you like to 
talk about?&quot;

&quot;Why,&quot; Kate hesitated, then, &quot;why did you stay there to help Kari?&quot;

Silver blinked, but took the question seriously. &quot;She&#39;s my friend,&quot; she 
said gently, &quot;she has been for years, ever since I first awoke as a 
freewill.&quot;

&#39;A freewill,&#39; Kate thought, &#39;of course.&#39; She drank some of her beer, &quot;I 
haven&#39;t met many freewills on my job.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Silver said dryly.

Kate just had to smile at that.

&quot;You&#39;ve been hurt by an android, haven&#39;t you?&quot; Silver asked her sadly.

Kate looked startled, &quot;How did you ...?&quot;

Silver shrugged, &quot;It pays to be able to read people in my job.&quot; She 
looked across at Kate, her eyes showing concern, &quot;Do you want to talk 
about it?&quot;

&quot;No, I...&quot; Kate flushed, looking down at her beer. &#39;I&#39;ve said more to 
her than I&#39;ve had to my psychiatrist,&#39; Kate thought to herself ruefully, 
and decided not to think about that too much.

&quot;Don&#39;t want to talk about yourself, hmm?&quot; Silver smiled. She looked 
thoughtful, and tapped Kate&#39;s nearly full bottle of beer, &quot;Looks like 
you don&#39;t drink much, either.&quot;

&quot;Well, no,&quot; Kate shrugged.

&quot;Don&#39;t talk, don&#39;t drink,&quot; Silver mused, then she smoothly rose to her 
feet. She offered her hand to Kate, &quot;Do you dance? Promise I&#39;ll let you 
lead.&quot;

Kate blinked at her in surprise, then she smiled back at Silver. &quot;Yes, I 
dance,&quot; Kate grinned, taking Silver&#39;s hand and standing up beside her.

Silver curtsied, Kate bowed, then Silver stepped in close to Kate as 
slower song started up, and they swayed together to the music. It felt 
surprisingly pleasant to Kate, holding Silver against her, gently 
guiding her across the crowded dance floor.

&quot;I think I like this place,&quot; Kate murmured to Silver softly, &quot;but I 
didn&#39;t catch the name when I went inside.&quot;

&quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Silver murmured back, adding, &quot;you do dance well.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kate grinned, and they danced on.

Author&#39;s Notes: heh, a little cameo of my Arisugawa&#39;s Locket series, and 
it&#39;s bartender Ryouko. I may expand on this in the Locket series itself, 
depending on if I feel like it.
