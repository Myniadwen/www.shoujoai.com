<h1>Blood, Sex, and Magik (part 24 of 27)</h1>

<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Jess Drake stood in the back room of Purgatori, the
notorious fetish club, the smell of leather, sweat and
blood nearly choking her as she faced off against a
woman who was all too familiar to her. She tightened
her hand on her wooden cane, readying the weapon while
ignoring Modred and the woman who was bound up to the
wall in a lewd pose.

Coldly Jess said, &quot;Do you think your being a bit too
obvious?&quot;

The elegantly dressed redhead smiled back at her from
where she stood by the door, her one eyebrow raising
slightly as she posed with a casual sort of beauty.
Me&#39;erlyn said swiftly, &quot;I thought it was all rather
elegant, actually.&quot; Her smile grew wider as she asked,
&quot;What, are there no warm greetings for a old friend?&quot;

&quot;How about a kick in the teeth instead, Me&#39;erlyn?&quot;
Jess scowled back, her pose openly hostile. She tossed
a look at the girl who was bound to the wall and
demanded, &quot;And where&#39;s Helen? We both know that&#39;s a
changeling.&quot;

Me&#39;erlyn looked amused, &quot;Well done, Jess. How did you
know?&quot;

&quot;I could smell the distinctive stench,&quot; Jess said
flatly.

At her mistress&#39; silent cue the copy of Helen pulled
herself free of the chains that secured her to the
wall, her body shifting like flowing wax as she did
so. Golden hair went midnight black, red scars on her
body fading away as she filled out, flesh flowing back
onto a thin frame. &quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; she bowed to Me&#39;erlyn
while ignoring Jess, &quot;did I do well?&quot;

&quot;Well enough,&quot; Me&#39;erlyn nodded back to her, &quot;go up
front and tell Sal the truth, please, as well as where
we put the real Helen.&quot; With a flash of smile she
cautioned her servant, &quot;She&#39;ll be angry, so be ready
to duck.&quot;

A faint smile crossed her eerily beautiful face then
the changeling bowed respectfully, &quot;Of course,
m&#39;lady.&quot; She swept out of the room with a unearthly
grace, her gaze only falling on Jess&#39; face a moment,
but the hate in the eyes burned hot.

&quot;Wha&#39; the hell...?&quot; Modred started to groan from where
he lay on the sticky floor nearby. Without even
looking at him Jess kicked out, her foot striking
viciously to the side of his head and making him slump
unconscious.

&quot;Was that really needed?&quot; Me&#39;erlyn asked.

&quot;No, but it sure made me feel better,&quot; Jess growled,
watching Me&#39;erlyn with tense wariness. &quot;And what&#39;s
with that name? It sounds like the sort of thing that
a magic wannabe would choose.&quot;

&quot;So does my birth name,&quot; Me&#39;erlyn said as she closed
the distance between them. Her green eyes glittered
with amusement as she reached out to stroke Jess&#39;
collar, &quot;But I have fond memories of you crying out
Merlin.&quot;

Jess carefully took a half step back to keep some room
between them. &quot;So why all this trouble, Merlin?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;All what?&quot; Merlin asked innocently, seeming just a
disappointed at Jess pulling back.

&quot;You obviously lured me down here,&quot; Jess said to her
flatly. &quot;You confronted Sal with a magic based
problem, one that you knew she couldn&#39;t go in-house
with.&quot; With a slightly regretful smile she said, &quot;Sal
may hate my guts but she knows that I&#39;m principled
enough not to stand for this, so she came to ask for
my help.&quot;

Merlin began to clap her hands dramatically, her eyes
amused as she purred, &quot;Oh well done... did you know it
was a trap before you came?&quot;

&quot;Cut the crap,&quot; Jess&#39; eyes burned for a second with
pure anger as she barked, &quot;what the hell do you want?&quot;
She silently cursed herself, wishing she hadn&#39;t lost
her temper with her. Merlin was quite good at that,
bringing out the emotions that you might want to
hide... like Jess&#39; buried rage at the other mystic and
her one time lover.

&quot;You haven&#39;t changed at all, you&#39;re still the one who
would rage at the gods for their sins, if needed,&quot;
Merlin mused. Shaking her head she said, &quot;I&#39;ve come to
make you an offer, the same one I did for you years
ago.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not interested in helping you take over the
Lady&#39;s organization,&quot; Jess answered, making a cutting
gesture with her hand, &quot;it&#39;s insane to even try.&quot;

&quot;Not necessarily,&quot; Merlin smiled calmly as she reached
out to toy with a whip hanging on the wall, stroking
the leather thoughtfully, &quot;you know the streets better
than most, you can hear all the rumors as well as I.&quot;

Jess nodded reluctantly, acknowledging the point.
There were rumors circulating, a buzz on the streets
that seemed to jump from person to person like a
virus. The Lady was in trouble, her operations being
hit again and again by a demon that seemed immune to
her punishments. The fact that the stories were
exaggerated didn&#39;t matter much, they were still
undermining the image of the Lady Diana&#39;s
invincibility.

&quot;The street level mooks won&#39;t actually act against
her, they aren&#39;t quite that stupid, but their loyalty
to her is wavering,&quot; Merlin smiled, &quot;if a strong
figure swept in to depose the Lady, they&#39;d follow in a
heartbeat.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t think it&#39;ll be that easy,&quot; Jess said
skeptically.

&quot;The Lieutenants with fight hard, their fates are tied
up with the Lady,&quot; Merlin acknowledged, &quot;but I think
we can win.&quot;

&quot;And do you really have that kind of organization
behind you?&quot; Jess asked as she raised an eyebrow in
pure disbelief.

&quot;My round table is nearly complete,&quot; Merlin answered
calmly, not seeming to take offense as she continued,
&quot;it only lacks one thing.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Jess had to ask.

Meeting Jess&#39; eyes Merlin calmly said, &quot;I need an
Arthur.&quot;

For the first time Jess actually looked surprised,
meeting Merlin&#39;s green eyes in disbelief. &quot;You&#39;ve got
to be joking,&quot; she scoffed.

&quot;I&#39;m quite serious,&quot; Merlin smiled, &quot;I&#39;m a organizer,
a planer and tactician, but one thing I&#39;m not is a
charismatic leader.&quot;

&quot;You want a figurehead,&quot; Jess made a face, &quot;even if I
was interested I&#39;d say no to that.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Merlin corrected, &quot;I want a conscience.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Jess blinked.

A warm smile flickered on Merlin&#39;s face then was gone.
&quot;In the past we often talked about what we&#39;d do with
that kind of power,&quot; she said as she met Jess&#39; eyes
earnestly, &quot;about all the good that we could do...&quot;

&quot;You could do,&quot; Jess corrected, &quot;at the time I wasn&#39;t
too interested in that.&quot; Cruelly she added, &quot;I was
mostly concentrating on how good of a lay you were.&quot;

Merlin winced just a bit. &quot;&quot;Fair enough,&quot; she
acknowledged, &quot;but you know my intentions have always
been good.&quot;

&quot;And we both know what the road to hell is paved by,&quot;
Jess answered flatly.

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Merlin acknowledged, &quot;just acquiring the
level of power I have now has involved a lot of moral
compromise and difficult ethical choices. Right and
wrong has become much less clear to me than it was
when we were together years ago.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not qualified to be your conscience,&quot; Jess
thought of all her own ethical compromises, &quot;I&#39;m no
paladin.&quot;

&quot;I disagree,&quot; Merlin smiled fondly. Taking a deep
breath she made her voice business like, &quot;I&#39;m not
asking you to decide now, but please think about it.&quot;

&quot;That I can do,&quot; Jess nodded, taking the card that
Merlin extended to her. Looking down at the still out
cold Modred she asked, &quot;About the names...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re allies,&quot; Merlin said with some discomfort, &quot;but
the related names are just one of those odd
coincidences.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Jess didn&#39;t believe her but didn&#39;t feel like
pressing the point.

Almost as soon as Jess Drake stepped out into the main
club there was a ripple of pure silence, the people
looking at her with a wary sort of awe. Dressed in
leather and lace, fine clothes or rags the customers
pulled back in respect, clearing a route right to the
exit. Their eyes searched Jess questioningly,
wondering what had really happened in that back room,
but no one dared speak as she staked through the club
and out the armored front door.

&quot;Where&#39;s Sal?&quot; Jess asked, seeing the changeling
leaning up against the wall where Sal would normally
been keeping watch.

A bit of blood marked the changeling&#39;s face, but other
than that she seemed unharmed as she used the wall to
support herself. The black haired woman smiled grimly,
&quot;The warrior left to retrieve her lover from the hotel
where m&#39;lady left her ensourced.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;d better not be harmed,&quot; Jess said as she studied
the other figure thoughtfully, &quot;or Sal will beat
Merlin bloody.&quot;

&quot;M&#39;lady is a romantic,&quot; the changeling said coldly,
&quot;she would do no such thing.&quot;

&#39;When I knew Merlin years ago she&#39;d never pull a stunt
like this,&#39; Jess thought. &quot;There&#39;s anger in your eyes
when you look at me,&quot; Jess decided not to be subtle,
&quot;and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because of my past connection
to Merlin.&quot;

&quot;I am her loyal servant,&quot; the changeling drew herself
up in pride as she said grimly, &quot;that is all you need
to know.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; and Jess walked off into the night.</pre>
