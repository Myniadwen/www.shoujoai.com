<a href="../original/angelgift-ch33.html">Back to Part 33</a><pre>Swiftly Allison Tennison pulled on her uniform coat,
the sandy brown haired woman cutting quite a dashing
figure as she hurried from the landing pad to the
Palace on Throneworld. Amara and Kat hurried to keep
up, the three cutting across the nearly deserted
field.

&quot;So, another planning meeting?&quot; Kat asked curiously,
her brown braid bouncing against her back as she
hurried to keep up with her best friend.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Allison nodded, &quot;thankfully we&#39;re just about
done.&quot;

&quot;You hope,&quot; Amara smirked. The black haired woman was
a slim, boyish figure in her uniform, almost looking
like some kind of pirate with her rakish good looks.

&quot;Did you and Roma find some time to be alone
together?&quot; Allison&#39;s voice was teasing as she looked
at Kat.

Kat blushed charmingly, remembering the few hours she
had been able to snatch to be with her android lover.
&quot;We managed, yeah,&quot; she nodded as they passed the
first of many security checks into the palace.

&quot;Nice blush,&quot; Amara drawled.

&quot;And what&#39;s this I hear about you and Laurel D&#39;ken
having meals together in the Sword&#39;s cafeteria?&quot; Kat
shot back quickly.

&quot;She&#39;s nice,&quot; Amara flashed a grin.

&quot;No fighting you two,&quot; Allison fought back a chuckle
as they passed a guard, the main hall looming up ahead
of them.

&quot;Welcome, Captain Tennison,&quot; X&#39;tahn smiled her
greeting, the white furred catgirl waiting by the main
doors. While officially the Queen&#39;s maid she was in
fact a trusted companion and friend, almost a second
mother to Jenna.

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you again, ma&#39;am,&quot; Allison agreed.
She looked curious and asked, &quot;Where&#39;s Milly?&quot;

X&#39;tahn looked faintly amused, &quot;I believe she took a
shuttle up to the Liberty&#39;s Sword to visit Sharin.&quot;

&quot;Well, well,&quot; Kat chuckled, &quot;isn&#39;t that cute?&quot;

&quot;That explains all the pouncing,&quot; Amara agreed.

&quot;I get the feeling I&#39;m missing something,&quot; Allison
sighed as the massive doors swung open soundlessly.

&quot;Pouncing,&quot; X&#39;tahn&#39;s eyes danced with silent laughter,
&quot;is one of our peoples first courting rituals,
Allison.&quot;

&quot;Milly and Sharin?&quot; Allison blinked, then smiled
slightly as she recalled how close the two women were.

&quot;Allison!&quot; The flying hug sent the two women crashing
to the floor, Jenna snuggling close to the other woman
as she purred, &quot;I missed you!&quot;

&quot;I missed you too, love,&quot; Allison laughed as she
wrapped her arms around her curvaceous lover and held
her close.

&quot;Nice to see the love hasn&#39;t gone out of their
relationship,&quot; Kat quipped cheerfully as Allison and
Jenna kissed.

&quot;If that&#39;s what she&#39;s like after they&#39;ve been parted a
few weeks, imagine what&#39;ll happen if they part for a
few months,&quot; Amara noted with amusement.

&quot;Don&#39;t even say that,&quot; Jenna sighed as she pulled back
a bit, sitting in Allison&#39;s lap on the floor. &quot;I
thought I&#39;d go mad as it was.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Allison kissed her again, lingeringly,
then both rose to their feet.

Jenna cuddled close to her as she said, &quot;I understand
the demands of duty, m&#39;love, but that doesn&#39;t mean I
have to like it.&quot;

&quot;Princess, your mother is waiting,&quot; X&#39;tahn said with
carefully hidden amusement.

&quot;Come on, then,&quot; Jenna laughed as she lead them onward
through the massive chamber toward the throne room
itself.

&quot;How are the preparations for the wedding going?&quot;
Amara asked curiously.

&quot;It&#39;s still growing uncontrollably,&quot; Jenna rolled her
eyes as she laughed, &quot;or we&#39;d have had the thing by
now.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a bit of an exaggeration,&quot; X&#39;tahn paused, &quot;but
not by much.&quot;

&quot;And how big of a part do we have in it?&quot; Kat asked
them just a bit nervously.

&quot;The groom,&quot; X&#39;tahn nodded to Allison, &quot;will need a
honor guard.. I assume you&#39;ll both be willing to
help?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Amara answered promptly, Kat nodding
agreement.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Allison smiled, &quot;I may need someone to
stand me up if I faint.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be ready,&quot; Kat clapped her on the shoulder.

Another arch lead them through to the main throne room
itself, where X&#39;tahn bowed gracefully, &quot;M&#39;lady,
they&#39;re here.&quot;

Queen Jen&#39;ai looked up from documents she was
studying, her face lighting up in a gentle smile of
greeting. &quot;Welcome home,&quot; she said then grinned, &quot;and
congratulations on your defense of Showalter,
Captain.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Allison blushed as she looked down.

Jen&#39;ai chuckled softly, &quot;Your modesty becomes you, but
don&#39;t forget to acknowledge your accomplishments.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve been following your exploits eagerly,&quot; X&#39;tahn
added, &quot;and a few of the enemy communications on you,
too.&quot;

&quot;You can tap enemy communication?&quot; Allison asked, eyes
narrowing as she considered the possibilities,

&quot;And what are they saying about us?&quot; Amara asked with
a rakish grin.

Jenna laughed softly at that. &quot;Most of it&#39;s
uncomplimentary,&quot; she revealed, &quot;that damn maverick
being the mildest.&quot; Her voice turned scolding, &quot;I
swear we learned more about the battle from them
rather than your reports.&quot;

&quot;I thought they were good reports,&quot; Allison protested.

&quot;If you like dry reading, yes,&quot; Jen&#39;ai laughed.</pre>
