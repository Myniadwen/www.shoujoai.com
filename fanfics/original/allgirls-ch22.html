&quot;Hello, Mira.&quot; Hug.

&quot;Hello, Blake.&quot; Peck. Smile. &quot;Blake, I have been thinking. The weekend 
is soon and I thought maybe we could have special date.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;d like that.&quot;

&quot;But not just with you: I have a... a friend I&#39;d like you to meet.&quot; That 
was close to the truth&#151;but still distant, bitterly distant; Mira in fact 
was very attracted to her &quot;friend&quot;. Blake still smiled.

&quot;Oh, well, that&#39;s nice. Always good to meet my girlfriend&#39;s buddies. 
Someone from your anime circle?&quot;

&quot;No, somebody new.&quot; Also a half-truth, half because her relationship 
with Usha was only slightly younger than hers with Blake. She smiled 
anyway.

&quot;Ah, good to meet new friends. So where do you have in mind, someplace 
fancy? You know, I&#39;ve got a nice black dress I&#39;d like to pull out 
again&#151;but maybe we shouldn&#39;t go to places like that. Somewhere more 
casual.&quot; Mira silently agreed. Blake knew her well enough to know that 
her girlfriend hated wearing dresses. She liked the look on other girls, 
but she was just far too casual and relaxed for the sophistication of 
evening wear. For funerals and weddings, she might&#39;ve made an exception, 
but...

&quot;You know of any places?&quot;

&quot;What about... Ramon Mickey&#39;s? It&#39;s a step above sit-in restaurants, and 
below the type people wear their Sunday best to, so it works out.&quot;

&quot;Sounds good. Where is it, and what time?&quot; Blake gave her easy-to-follow 
directions (being attention-deficit, she had no other way of getting 
around), and suggested Saturday at 8:00 pm. Mira&#39;s parents didn&#39;t mind 
her going out so late on weekends; Blake&#39;s were more strict, especially 
her mother, but even then they allowed room for freedom. The two of them 
agreed, and hugged and kissed on it.

&quot;I hope I like this friend of yours.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you will.&quot; Mira smiled, totally unaware of, well, everything. 
Blake, on the other hand, felt like for once, her life was going very 
well.

Yet in two hours, everything would change.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re making friends,&quot; said Usha quietly, her hands entwined 
with Blake&#39;s as they sat on the bleachers. &quot;It&#39;s awfully nice of you to 
introduce me. I suppose it&#39;s really just your way of accepting who you 
are and telling other people of it. Do your... other four friends know 
of our relationship?&quot;

&quot;Uh, not yet. I&#39;m waiting for a good time to tell them.&quot; That was an 
understatement: they already knew about Mira, and were happy for her, 
but what would they say if they learned Blake had two girlfriends?

&quot;I guess then, after tonight, you&#39;ll want to tell all your friends. 
You&#39;re starting with this one.&quot; A pause.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said thickly. If only Usha knew. Blake feared her action 
would be incredibly destructive&#151;that one or both of them would get mad 
at her and break up&#151;but she had to have them both in the same room, she 
had to have them together. She couldn&#39;t go on for much longer, flitting 
between the two of them, splitting her heart in two. She had to take one 
or neither; having both would be completely impossible, unless they both 
were open to it and were willing to share. But what were the odds of 
that?

&quot;So where?&quot; asked Usha, combing her fingers into Blake&#39;s autumnal hair.

&quot;Ramon Mickey&#39;s, eight pm, tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Ah. I&#39;ll wear...&quot; Usha leaned forward, and whispered with a faintly 
seductive voice, &quot;a red dress.&quot; Blake turned dark pink.

&quot;I&#39;ve got a nice black one I&#39;ve been meaning to wear,&quot; she managed. Usha 
grinned. Already she was looking forward to the evening of the morrow. 
She knew she would like Blake&#39;s new friend.

............

Ramon Mickey&#39;s: good, but not too good. Social, but not social. High up, 
but just short enough to reach. Maybe a little too fancy to be kept in 
the middle: any restaurant with a fountain and chamber orchestra in it 
wasn&#39;t run-of-the-mill. It was the kind of place people dressed up for, 
though it wasn&#39;t required; the kind that lovers went to and the rich 
described as laid-back; it was a nice place, and big, where people 
minded their affairs unless they saw a friend across from them. Blake 
arrived there first, not quite dressed to kill, but still looking sharp. 
She was ten minutes early and alone.

The table she had reserved for three was deserted. That was okay&#151;after 
all, it was only 7:50. That was partially Gabrielle&#39;s fault, who had 
driven extra quickly so her friend could steal some &quot;smooch time&quot; with 
Mira while waiting (Gab&#39;s words, not hers). Blake had not appreciated 
her close friend butting in like that, but that was her way. Besides, 
the view was exquisite and the music&#151;live from the orchestra, not some 
garbled radio&#151;was pleasant. By the time 7:55 rolled around, she was 
enjoying herself and already knew what she wanted to eat.

&quot;Blake!&quot; She jumped as she felt something tap her shoulder. It was Mira, 
looking quite elegant in spite of her casual attire. She had brought out 
her best pair of creamy-tan khakis to wear, along with a pure-white 
blouse that allowed her arms to go bare. She had braided her 
reddish-orange hair, and allowed a chain, a bracelet, and two clip-on 
earrings to adorn herself. She had no makeup and very little perfume, 
but without the cartoonish shirts she usually wore, she looked all the 
fancier.

&quot;Mira, you look fabulous!&quot;

&quot;I tried my best,&quot; she replied as she hugged Blake. She kissed her ear 
quickly and asked, &quot;So where is Blake&#39;s buddy?&quot;

&quot;Um... late, I guess&#151;or right on time. I checked our table and she&#39;s not 
there.&quot;

&quot;Did you look in the women&#39;s bathroom?&quot; Blake made a face.

&quot;Now that&#39;s an idea. Excuse me.&quot; Mira watched her go and smiled at the 
receptionist, a woman not much older than she who was considerably 
better dressed. She proudly told the woman that she was with her 
girlfriend&#151;in Dutch, for fun&#151;and waited patiently for a few seconds. She 
sighed. Mira grew restless and walked around, looking for their table. 
Having no idea where it was, of course, she quickly became lost.

Blake didn&#39;t find Usha in the bathroom, so she went back to the 
reception area. The woman was there, looking bored and now confused: 
Mira had spoken utter nonsense for all she knew. The lady wasn&#39;t 
important; Blake spotted Usha waiting patiently and greeted her with a 
hug. She had worn a red dress, but it looked so casual that it could&#39;ve 
passed as normal clothes. It really brought out her Indian features; 
Baum was captivated instantly.

Well, here goes nothing. I tried to warn you, but since you insisted, I 
guess we&#39;re in this for the long run. Don&#39;t whine to me if they break 
your heart.

But wouldn&#39;t it be cool if they liked each other?

You perv.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; asked Usha, seeing her girlfriend&#39;s smile. Blake told 
a truth, but not the truth (there was a difference).

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just happy&#151;but where&#39;s that blasted girl? I left her here. 
Maybe she&#39;s in the bathroom.&quot;

&quot;You think I could go before we started? I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d need to when 
I left home, but now...&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;d be really bad manners to introduce you two in the women&#39;s 
bathroom.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but, she may not be in there.&quot; Blake pursed her lips anxiously. 
Considering her streak of good fortune up until then, something ill was 
bound to happen sooner or later. Then again, even if both Mira and Usha 
were in the bathroom, odds were that they would just say hello and walk 
away, or not even see each other.

&quot;Well,&quot; she resolved, &quot;if you gotta go, you gotta go.&quot; Usha left her 
alone with the receptionist, who merely shook her head. Blake grinned 
and told her that she was with both of her girlfriends, speaking 
entirely in Hebrew, which she was fluent in.

After waiting awhile, Blake became impatient and began to search for 
Mira. Hoping against hope she wasn&#39;t in the bathroom, she checked their 
table first. She mentally kicked herself as she realized she had never 
told Mira where their table was, and doubled her efforts in searching. 
She found the poor girl wandering around lost, talking to herself in 
Dutch. Blake nearly laughed as she dove in after her.

&quot;Mira! Over here!&quot; Mira sighed and uttered what sounded like a relieved 
exclamation.

&quot;About time,&quot; she concluded, &quot;I&#39;ve been lost! Where&#39;s our table?&quot;

&quot;Over here.&quot; Blake showed her, and implored her to sit and look at the 
menu. When asked why she would not join, Blake told her that she had 
found the third in their party, and she had came right on time. She 
excused herself and strayed towards the bathroom, leaving Mira to shrug.

Naturally, she missed Usha by that much.

Walking with a debonair stride, Krishnan went searching for Blake, first 
stopping by the reception area, then asking the receptionist herself 
(barring foreign languages). The tired-looking, confused woman showed 
her the table, and to her delight and amazement, she found Mira walking 
around!

&quot;Why, Mira van Dijk! What are you doing here!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Yusha!&quot; She grinned her standard heartwarming grin and took the 
slightly older woman in an embrace. &quot;This is very odd!&quot; she exclaimed. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t expect to see you here! Wherefore art thou?&quot; (She had learned 
the phrase in Madsen&#39;s and Post&#39;s classes)

&quot;I asked first.&quot;

&quot;My... friend and I are here. She is going to introduce me to... 
somebody.&quot;

&quot;Oh? What a funny coincidence. I&#39;m here for the same reason.&quot; Mira 
flashed a look of surprise.

&quot;Yes, funny it is. Would it be funny if our friends knew each other, 
too?!&quot;

&quot;Or were the same person,&quot; muttered the other. A pause awkwardly wedged 
in between them and they took a breath.

&quot;Maybe the four of us could have a meal right here,&quot; suggested Mira at 
length.

&quot;Oh, that would be lovely. Could you please wait here; I&#39;m going to 
fetch my friend.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes, I must look for mine as well.&quot; The two girls split up and 
searched the restaurant. Things became very interesting (and humorous) 
after that. First, Blake came by the table and found neither of her 
friends with her, then got the same reception up front. She bumped into 
Mira around the bathroom, surprised to see her up and about. She sent 
Mira back and looked for Usha; she found her wandering around, looking 
for her. Blake showed Usha the table she had reserved, and would&#39;ve 
bumped into Mira again if she had suddenly not gone up again.

&quot;I swear,&quot; she murmured as she searched for her truant girlfriend, &quot;I 
oughta staple that girl&#39;s butt to the chair.&quot; Usha, meanwhile, ordered 
her drink and found that Mira had merely lost something along the way 
and had been looking for it. She invited Mira to sit, but the poor girl 
(who was so disoriented, she didn&#39;t even recognize her own reserved 
table) only stayed to get a drink before searching for Blake again. Now 
Blake came back, sans Mira, and saying some rather unwholesome things. 
She discovered that her friend had already gotten a drink, so she asked 
for one as well&#151;and left. Usha went up to help her search.

Now Mira came back, and found the table empty. She figured she had been 
up and walking long enough, and vowed to sit until Blake, her friend, 
and Usha were all there. Blake came by later (Mira explained about the 
lost item and was forgiven), and told her girlfriend in a strict but 
gentle voice to STAY PUT. Mira couldn&#39;t help but laugh and promised; 
then, Blake went back for Usha (all the time, her anxiety built). Usha, 
giving up on the search, decided to just sit and wait at the table, and 
was glad to find Mira. The two sat together and waited until at last, 
Blake came by&#151;and surprised all of them.

Blake looked at Mira, then Usha. Mira looked at Usha, then Blake. Usha 
looked at Blake, then Mira. The silence between them was deadly and 
obscene.

&quot;Uh, hi,&quot; managed Blake. &quot;Uh... it... looks like... you found each 
other.&quot; Mira and Usha looked at each other again, and said at the exact 
same time, &quot;This is your friend?&quot;

Then, after realizing what was happening, they said, &quot;Friend? I&#39;m her 
girlfriend!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re her girlfriend? I thought you were my...&quot; They froze again. 
Blake turned red, then white, then green. She just managed to sit before 
she fell.

&quot;Maybe... we should talk,&quot; said Usha quietly. Mira looked upset.

&quot;Yes indeed! What is going on? Blake, you and Yusha? I thought we...&quot;

&quot;I thought I was her...&quot; said Usha, before stopping herself. She paled 
and stated, &quot;Blake was the girl I had a crush on for a year.&quot;

&quot;Now wait a second,&quot; said Blake, but she was cut off by Mira. She said 
something sharp in her own language before turning back to Usha.

&quot;You asked me to be your girlfriend when you already had one? And it was 
Blake? She is my girlfriend!&quot;

&quot;I... I didn&#39;t know!&quot; she replied defensively. &quot;I mean... well... you 
accepted, and you already had her!&quot;

&quot;Blake accepted you too! I asked her first!&quot;

&quot;Girls, please don&#39;t fight, least of all over me...&quot;

&quot;Not now,&quot; stated Usha calmly. She then turned to Mira and, &quot;Mira, 
namaste, but I feel the same way about Blake. And you do too.&quot;

&quot;What is na-mas-te?&quot; she asked. When Usha answered, the words sounded 
very poetic and fluid.

&quot;&#39;The highest in me salutes the highest in you&#39;. It&#39;s a general greeting 
and farewell of Hindu origin, but it can also mean that... I like you.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; interjected Blake. She gawped and asked breathlessly, 
&quot;You mean you two are...&quot;

That part about actions speaking louder than words? All true.

Mira and Usha proved it by nodding, then took each other&#39;s hands and 
kissed, in spite of the crowd and their earlier arguing. Blake looked 
like she had seen a dinosaur.

&quot;Oh my God...&quot; she whispered. Watching Mira and Usha kiss was ten times 
more unreal than believing they actually liked her. She had to admit, 
though, it was turning her on&#151;and she didn&#39;t feel jealous or angry at 
all. She liked Mira. She liked Usha. If they got together, if they liked 
each other, what harm could there possibly, really be?

&quot;Wow,&quot; she whispered when they finished. Both girls grinned at each 
other, and at Blake. They quickly apologized for arguing, and seemed to 
loosen and be less tense. Mira quickly leaned forward and kissed her 
&quot;other&quot; girlfriend once, twice, thrice, making Usha feel exactly the way 
Blake had felt earlier. They were both very dear to her, and now... She 
could not restrain herself. She needed to feel Blake&#39;s lips embracing 
hers. They kissed once, deeply, making Mira&#39;s heart melt. It was like 
the ultimate crossover, like watching anime and reading her favorite 
Terry Pratchett at the same time. She felt unusually happy, not the 
least bit jealous. She loved Blake. She loved Usha.

After awhile, sitting in silence, Blake finally spoke: &quot;This is unreal. 
I never imagined in my wildest dreams&#151;well, maybe my wildest, but 
certainly not in my normal ones, that this would ever happen. It&#39;s 
just... implausible. I think I need some fresh air.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;ll be no more going about for awhile,&quot; said Usha firmly, taking 
her arm before she could leave. &quot;We had enough of that early on; we 
should all have just stayed put and saved the trouble.&quot;

&quot;I thought it was funny,&quot; noted Mira lightly. The other girls gave her 
looks, but not bad ones. Blake took a deep breath and apologized, but 
she still felt flushed. After drinking a quarter-cup of water, she began 
to compose herself. Ordering the grilled salmon and minestrone soup made 
her feel better still. Mira had steak, her favorite; Usha chose a light 
pasta dish and a small cake the three could share later. Once the waiter 
left, there was still an air of awkward silence above them, but at least 
it was not thick or troublesome.

&quot;I think we&#39;re all aware that we each have feelings for one another,&quot; 
Blake said at last. &quot;I like you both, and you both like me, and you both 
like each other. The odds of something like this happening is 
phenomenal, especially considering my bad luck with women in the past. 
Well, call it compensation or karma; it&#39;s happened. I just don&#39;t know if 
a three-way relationship will ever work out. Personally, I don&#39;t want to 
end it with either of you&#151;&quot;

&quot;And I feel the same all the way,&quot; added Mira. She took both their 
hands, and drew them together until all three touched. The gesture was 
universal and warmhearted: it explained everything she knew, and wanted. 
&quot;I like you both. You mean very much to me. I enjoy being with both of 
you. And seeing you two enjoy each other has made me happy in a very 
strange, but very good way. You could say that this weird little Dijk 
just gets off by watching two beautiful women she loves love on each 
other!&quot;

Usha and Blake laughed quietly. Honestly, they felt the same.

&quot;I can&#39;t imagine being without either of you myself,&quot; added Usha. 
&quot;You&#39;re both kind, warmhearted, gorgeous women, each with something 
special that&#151;if I may sound selfish for a moment&#151;has made me a better 
person. I love you both.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re ready for the big &#145;L&#39; word yet,&quot; murmured Blake, 
&quot;but yeah... you&#39;re both a part of my life that I love. But... I mean, 
could this really work out? Could we really, honestly have a three-way 
relationship without getting jealous, or mad, or... stupid? Because I&#39;m 
all three easily.&quot; Mira and Usha both smiled, and leaned in to each kiss 
her cheeks.

&quot;You just saw us arguing like cats, and yet we made up,&quot; noted Mira. 
&quot;Besides, do not all relationships have what you say?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but... three people?&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;ll be different,&quot; shrugged Usha. She took Blake&#39;s hand, then 
Mira&#39;s, and smiled at them both. &quot;In the end, though, there&#39;s only one 
way to find out.&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d say that.&quot; They smiled again, and tentatively, they 
clinked their glasses together and silently vowed to each other to do 
their best: to work as hard as they could to maintain good relations 
with each other, and love each other, and respect each other.

The love triangle made connected, all three points reaching to each 
other: two for every one, one for every two. It was not the end, nor 
even the beginning: everything has beginnings, but very rarely will 
there ever be a real end. It would just... continue.</pre>
