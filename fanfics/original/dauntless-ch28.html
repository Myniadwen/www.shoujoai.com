<p>“Space race: drifting”</p>
<p>We depart from  Hagan 6 quickly and continue on our journey. We depart because we  are in a hurry, and because we do not want to put the generosity of  Aseria’s father to waste. For the life of me, I can’t imagine  why he would want to sponsor us when there’s already a Sindar in  the race, but I suppose it’s the difference between his duty and  his daughter, and as much of an Emperor as he may be, his family will  forever come first. I have been hearing Aseria say that we should  visit her home world once this race is over—once Amy has fulfilled  her promise to Naja, I mean—because she has obligations to fulfill  and people to keep in touch with. There’s also the prospect of  unimaginable treasures hidden throughout her world, buried by earth  and water and time, forgotten by all save a tiny elect. She has  family there, our Aseria, and they are eagerly awaiting her return. I envy her for that.</p>
<p>The <em>Dauntless</em> is traveling through the Hagan system at speeds close to light  itself. I had thought such a concept was beyond the scope of  physics, pushed far into the reaches of science-fantasy stories, with  their warp speeds and hyperdrives, but it turns out that light is not  the absolute; one can exceed it, providing they have the capabilities  and the constitution for it. Breaking such a barrier is an enormous  strain on any vessel: its mass becomes infinite, and speed itself  loses all meaning. I’m not well-versed in Einstein’s theory,  though—I just know that we’re going incredibly fast, and we only  slow down when there’s a risk of collision. Even so, it’s taking  us hours to move from one checkpoint to another, and since I’m not  essential to keep the ship running, I have lots of time on my hands.</p>
<p>I’ve taken to  writing a personal journal during these moments. I’d like to keep  these memories once the journey is over; I feel like I’m going to  learn something from them. I have almost forgotten why I even signed  up. Can you believe it was on a whim? I wanted to explore the  galaxy, to see strange sights, to exercise my skills, find my  fortune, and learn as much as I could, but those early stages seem so  blurry now, compared to the dull monotony of our drifting. I suppose  that’s an unfair statement: it’s never dull here. I guess you  could say we are all “busy doing nothing”, slowly going insane as  our duties run dry and our desires begin to take real shape. I’ve  been studying new languages for the most part, trying to crack the  code of intelligent communication. My old teacher said that it was  “all a matter of the heart”, and once I comprehended the true  intention of any species, I wouldn’t even need to use languages—I  could simply speak in Language itself. Well, that’s what she  taught me. I’m afraid I’m not much closer to understanding what  she meant.</p>
<p>There are so many  mysteries about this alien vessel and her crew, so perhaps I should  occupy myself with cracking them. I’ve begun to lose concern for  the outside world, anyway—these people don’t need me for a <em>race</em>,  and  I’m still a touch uncomfortable with some of the women around  here. They make me feel giddy; their eyes dig beneath the barriers  I’ve erected and touch the secret corner of my being. I don’t  even know why I have these fantasies about other women—I guess it’s  just a bizarre sort of excitement, or a dream I dared to cultivate.  We’re all guilty of imagining ourselves as someone in distress  being saved by a strong, reliable person—or just the opposite, a  strong person in search of one who needs our rescue. Maybe this  unusual sensation I’ve been carrying around inside of me is the  biggest mystery of them all. It’s not wrong to be attracted to a  strong person, but when they’re the same gender as you…</p>
<p>Come on, Riene,  don’t think about that. You’re not on Earth anymore and you’ve  got your freedom. Why are you feeling remorseful now? You’ve  moved past all that; you’ve got the </p>
<p>entire universe to  spread your wings in. But I still feel trapped, and by a cage of my  own design. I let myself out once, when Chandra seduced me, but that  experience frightened me. I let myself surrender to her and it  wasn’t anything like I had hoped. She was the wrong person for me;  I couldn’t even bear to touch her. I want someone who can protect  me and carry me. I want someone who’s not afraid to use a little  force when they make love to me. I want to distance myself as far as  possible from my old life. I want to find someone whose heart I can  understand completely.</p>
<p>I  once thought that  Rebecca could be that person, and I really wanted her to fill that  role. She was strong and independent, but also very kind and warm,  and achingly beautiful to look at. She has this irresistible angelic  aura about her, and yet she can be so ordinary at times that I almost  feel brave enough to approach her, and stroke her face, and lose  myself in her arms. But I still don’t know. Am I infatuated, or  in love? Do I care about Rebecca specifically, or will any body do? If  she and I are “right” for each other, why is it so hard to  approach her? Last night, I took a walk around the ship with Kate,  and we talked for a bit and had dinner together. She was the kind of  person I could find myself in love with, but she was distracted, and  only seemed to tolerate me out of politeness. I couldn’t really  blame her. I’m not that special.</p>
<p>I also scheduled a  date with Satine. I definitely have a crush on her, and she’s much  easier to approach and talk to than Rebecca. I feel so uncomfortable  and awkward when I’m around that woman, but with Satine, I can  really be myself. I can feel open and vulnerable, and even weak, and  she’d still smile at me and pester me with questions. Maybe it’s  her doggish heritage, but she’s interested in just about anything I  can tell her, and the way her tail wags whenever I reveal something  new is just too adorable! She’s a martial artist, you know, and  she could probably hold her own with Lil, but she’s so pretty and  feminine, like a dashing maiden-knight glowing with love. We haven’t  spoken since we first met on Hagan 6, but she’s in my thoughts a  lot, up to the point where I’m distracted from my daily chores. But  like I said, we don’t have anything to do here, so my mind can  afford to wander.</p>
<p>And yet…no matter  how far it goes, or who else I dream about, it always returns to  Rebecca Hill. I just can’t get her out of my mind, no matter what  I do. It’s not as if we’re close, or that we’ve even spoken  that much. I feel dangerously unfamiliar when I’m near her, as if  I’ve left the mind of Riene Latoli and became someone else. But  whenever we do spend time together, things just seem to fall into  place. Even though I really don’t say too much, I feel those words  can be sincere, if not honest, and I genuinely enjoy myself. I’ve  caught her looking my way a few times, but she always casts her face  aside, as if she’s scared or ashamed. Am I making her feel like a  stranger in her own body as well? Should I even consider that she  feels the same undeniable attraction that I do? I really don’t  think anything will come of it, though. She’s spending a lot of  time with Lyara, and they seem to connect well. How could I be  jealous, I have to laugh, when I’ve caressed that rough beauty with  my own eyes more than once! Ahh, such a complicated series of  relationships…</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>I grew up believing  that space was empty, cold, lonely, and vast, and for the longest  time, I had no choice but to trust that. I had merely gazed, and  studied, and read, and imagined—I had never actually experienced  what lies beyond all those atmospheres. Drifting around, </p>
<p>occasionally dodging  an enthusiastic rival, has opened my mind to a new perspective—but  even this is only a fraction of the true knowledge I’ve gleaned  from my adventures. Space is vast, of course, but I don’t feel  anything empty or lonely about it. You may think I only say this  because I’m surrounded by people (who could leave anytime they  wanted), but it’s during my quiet times, when I’m reflecting in  the tub, the bed, or the library, that I feel warmest and most  comfortable.</p>
<p>I recall one  instance where several members of the crew heard music during flight. The <em>Dauntless</em> has a public announcement system and a radio that broadcasts messages  from outside and within, but this instance—and the instances that  have followed since—was completely unlike anything I have ever  heard. There was no melody or tempo or even any familiarity to the  music: it was sporadic and haunting and so, so, so quiet, you had to  hold your breath and be perfectly still. But it was warm, too, and  it made you feel like you were surrounded by life. You could say  that “space” itself is a lie, and that there isn’t <em>nothing</em> out here—it’s full of life. The ancients were right to call them  the Heavens; I’ve gone through experiences during my many moments  of solitary silence that would prove all of science wrong. It is in  planets and worlds where life can flicker out and die; they are not  islands but breaks in continuity, and beyond their borders are  wonders, not some heartless void.</p>
<p>I’ve also learned  a lot about our adversaries during this race, and I’ve also learned  a little about the galaxy in general. Satine Yeriman—“Sati” to  her friends—is one of the nicest, fairest people around, and she’s  a good rival. I really don’t think she cares about winning. To  her, this race is just for fun. I was also surprised to find the  Heavyworld racer was such a gallant man. He looks like a thug, but  he’s as gentle as a rabbit, and he comes to other people’s rescue  without a thought to his own position. The Dead Roses practically  threw themselves at him after he saved them from annihilation! They  also fawned over the young Lord Demise, which isn’t much of a  surprise, considering how rich, precocious, and childishly cute he  is. He’s a bit of a pervert, sure, but you can’t bring yourself  to hate him.</p>
<p>Aseria told me that  same-sex relationships are fairly common on Alfheim, so it didn’t  come as a shock to her when she met Arileth Naiis and his male lover  at the next checkpoint. I tried not to eavesdrop on their  conversation (they spoke in Sindari), but I couldn’t resist the  opportunity to exercise my fluency, or to see if I could pick up any  juicy gossip! Shame on me! Naja also ran into an old “acquaintance”  while we were resting there, and had a spat with her right in front  of everybody. The Elshyrin apparently do not consider the thoughts,  feelings, and opinions of other species when they talk—indeed, they  take great pride in shaking people up—but still, I wish they at  least found a private room to vent all their frustrations. The other  Elshyrin, a desperate-looking woman called Saki Yrhol, had been sent  by Naja’s family to drag her back, and forced Naja to agree that if  her ship didn’t make it in the top four, she could head straight  home. I know that Naja’s reluctant to go back, and as antagonistic  as she is, a part of me wants to help out. Not even she deserves to  do something against her will.</p>
<p>Vimmy was appalled  to discover the <em>Opportune  Rain</em> was one of our sworn opponents, but unlike Saki or the criminals from  Rennai, there was no clear reason for such belligerence. In so many  words (why does that little creature ramble on so much?), she deduced  that they couldn’t be bribed to work against us, so the only  logical conclusion she could offer was that they had struck a  business deal with somebody else, and our delay or destruction had  been included in the contract. The Norgrim can be even more vicious  than the Elshyrin if the benefits </p>
<p>are good enough;  even Vimmy isn’t exclusive, since she’s dabbled in disreputable  services before. She did try to justify the <em>Rain’s</em> aggression, saying that she might’ve done the same if she found a  deal good enough, but then spouted something about virtue and fair  play, and that’s when I left the room. What a load of crap.</p>
<p>I was careful to  watch out for the <em>Backdraft </em>and <em>Die  Fliegende Hollander</em>. We had every reason to fear them  both—one because we had seen far  too much of it, and the other because we have not seen nearly enough.  As race updates come in, the position of the top five competitors  changed constantly, but I never heard so much as a whisper of the <em>Hollander</em>. It was as evasive and ghostly as its legendary counterpart, but  those I talked to about this just shrugged and told me I was thinking  too much.</p>
<p>“It’s really  not surprising, considering you don’t have much to do,” Allegra  told me. She was reclining in the main lounge, flipping through all  the television stations that reached this far. “We’ve all been  forced to wrestle with our thoughts. That’s why ya can’t get too  comfortable, or else they’re liable to catch up with you. Why  don’t’cha help out Becky in the kitchen? I’ve been workin’  out so I don’t turn into a stuffed goose, n’ so I earned this  break.”</p>
<p>“In other words,  make yourself useful or you’ll regret it?” Allegra winked and  tipped her hat.</p>
<p>“Exactly.” I <em>had</em> been looking for an excuse to get close to Rebecca, and working  together in the kitchen sounded like a good idea. Even so, I  discovered I was preparing myself for what felt like an important  event that could only happen once in my life. We had just completed  the hellish Hagan 2 checkpoint (where our brave pilots were forced to  touch down on a volcanic world rich in minerals), so our shelves were  stocked and supplies were abundant. The kitchen was exactly the way  I thought it would be: I didn’t trust myself to be alone with  Rebecca, so I didn’t want us to be the only ones there, but I  didn’t want too many people spying and crowding us—it was  perfectly populated. I was seized by a twinge of grief as I saw  Becky working close together with Lyara, smiling and talking quite  openly, and for a moment I wanted to run off and avoid a  confrontation. But that would be silly; I don’t dislike Lyara, and  I certainly don’t envy any relationship she may have. I had to  remind myself that she was also growing closer to Sharyn, and finicky  fool that I am, I was infatuated with <em>her</em> as well.</p>
<p>“Need any help?”  I asked them softly. I wanted to be friendly, but I felt like I was  butting in on their privacy. Rebecca gave me a cautious expression  that was quickly masked by a watery smile; Lyara’s greeting was  mellower.</p>
<p>“Why not? You  can’t be any worse than Kyrie or Chandra.”</p>
<p>“Chandra’s  actually a splendid cook,” Rebecca pointed out as I donned apron  and gloves, “it’s just that she’s unaccustomed to serving large  crowds. You know, she tried to seduce me when we went on our date. At least my appetite was satisfied.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you two went  out on a date?” I asked teasingly. Both women rolled their eyes.</p>
<p>“I think we all  have, even me,” Lyara muttered. “That woman tries too hard. She  should just focus all her attention on one individual, instead of  spreading herself out like this.”</p>
<p>“Mmn, Chandra  would break down if she tried that,” Rebecca stated as she started  to grill fish and vegetables. “From what my aunt told me, pleasure  units weren’t built for monogamy.”</p>
<p>“Are they really  just robots made to look and act human?” I asked. Neither Rebecca  nor Lyara seemed to know that one, but luckily we had authorities in  the room with us. Eve and Kyrie had been eating together and  exchanging techno-babble pleasantries when they overheard our  conversation and offered their wisdom.</p>
<p>“Actually, only  one out of ten artificial humans is what you might call a machine—an  </p>
<p>engine formed out of  metal and other inorganic materials, and they’re only used for the  harshest tasks, such as exploring worlds with no atmosphere,  collecting data on hazardous planets, zero-g experiments, things like  that. Some are just very advanced cyborgs—people who were born  human but had artificial implants and things like that. I guess I’d  fall into that category.”</p>
<p>“What about  people like Herut and Chandra?”</p>
<p>“They’re unique  examples,” Kyrie said. “From what my grandmother and mother told  me, some artificial humans are actually salvaged embryos. Let’s  say a baby is stillborn, or is miscarried. Sometimes people can take  the base of that entity and enhance it through intricate  bio-mechanical implants. There are also people who…let’s say,  for some reason, are pushed to the brink of death, and only ‘certain  medical procedures’ can help them. I’ve even heard of a few  constructs that have a nano-machine exterior around their basic human  frame.” Lyara stared at Rebecca and me for a moment and flung her  hand over her head, gesturing that this was beyond her understanding.</p>
<p>“This sounds  scary,” I shivered. “So do you think they would fall under any  of these categories?”</p>
<p>“Who knows?”  Eve muttered. “You’d be better off asking them yourself,  although I doubt they’d be willing to talk about it. Personally, I  don’t give a rat’s ass whether you were born as flesh or metal. I’ve learned in my line of work that if it can think and has  feelings, it’s a person.” She sipped at her drink and wouldn’t  say anything else. It was easier interacting with Rebecca now that I  had something darker to think about--probably because it was  difficult noticing her. I do remember smiling at her, though, and  she definitely smiled back, if only to clear away all the rubbish  that had built up. Behind that simple gesture was the ray of  Pandora’s hope.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Pretty  soon we  would be reaching “the point of no return”, when the race  transforms from a playful contest into a serious contest of wills. The  very next checkpoint orbits Hagan’s star, and the other three  are a gauntlet of every intense situation ever conceived: asteroids,  the deep ocean, a frozen world out in the middle of nowhere, and  endless stretches of darkness in between. Naja brought us into this,  but it’s the duty of every crewmember to commit herself to the rest  of the race, and it was well within our right to be prepared. We  docked on the dark side of a small planet just outside Hagan’s  deadly orbit, and spent a few hours resting and gathering our  supplies. We saw a few of our fellow racers, and even befriended a  few—Sati, for example, who actually asked me out on a date. I  didn’t know what to expect when I accepted her proposal, but I  wanted to believe I was prepared for anything.</p>
<p>Have you ever been  so far into the country that no trace of electric light ever reaches  you? And have you ever been that deep when the sun goes out, the  clouds float away, and hundreds of thousands of stars burst like  fireworks frozen in the sky? This is exactly what Sati and I saw as  we drove out in our shuttle, and even with our spacesuits on and our  words garbled by the mechanical transmissions, we couldn’t help but  be blown away by the majestic spectacle. It is fifty times better  with the sun directly behind the planet: everything is lit up as if  it were made exclusively for you. We could not stay outside long,  but that fleeting moment was more than enough to lift our spirits and  give us the focus we needed for the final leg. It had all been </p>
<p>worth it just to see  that. Sati and I didn’t say anything as we got out of our suits  and made our way to the cafeteria; we just looked at each other and  understood. She floated by and gave me a quick kiss on my mouth  before opening the door for me.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of  next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Rebecca: Okay,  let’s see if we can get this straightened out. I have a thing for  Riene and Lyara.</p>
<p>Lyara: And I have a  thing for you and Sharyn.</p>
<p>Riene: I like  Becky, Lyara, Sharyn, Sati, Mink, Yenae, Alala…</p>
<p>Sharyn: Whereas  mine heart yearneth for Allegra and Fuuka.</p>
<p>Kate: Hey, <em>I</em> like Allegra.</p>
<p>Athena: And Fuuka’s  mine.</p>
<p>Mink: Um…I like  Shana…</p>
<p>Alala: Now that I  think about it, Kaori’s really hot!</p>
<p>Yenae: And me…well,  I think everybody knows!</p>
<p>Shana: Even though  our hearts yearn for different people, we all have two things in  common! First, we <em>all</em> like Amy.</p>
<p>Naja: I guess.</p>
<p>Shana: And second,  we’ll be fighting for our lives in the next chapter!</p>
<p>Naja: Yee-haw! And  thank the gods, too! I’m getting tired of this soap opera, crap!</p>
<p>Amy: Please stay  tuned when I fight off all my admirers in, “Space Race: pursued by  an inferno!” Wait, does Derian have a thing for me, too?</p>
<p>Eve: (staring at a  picture of the Jackal) My precioussss…</p>
