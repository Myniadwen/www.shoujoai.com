~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Ouku-Zai Park, Shibuya  

Yoko took a look around while the other members of the White Crow Gang 
got into position. It was a car park. Clear, empty, on the edge of 
Shibuya. It was obvious that this gang came here to settle differences 
on a regular basis. They knew all kinds of shortcuts to this place. It 
helped that it was nearby to an actual grassy park, the perfect place to 
make a quick escape when the time was needed. Jin Han Yung, Liang Ho 
Yung and the rest of the group assembled around a space inside of the 
open-air car park. Yoko walked into the centre of the ring they had 
formed. Jin Han did the same, coming forth. The circle spread outwards, 
to give the two of them more room to fight. But Yoko concentrated on 
Jin.

Jin Han Yung was different from most gang leaders. He was sharp, polite, 
serious and no-nonsense And he did look pretty challenging. Yoko hoped 
for the most that this was true It was a silly idea to follow a bunch of 
Tokyo punks into an isolated, hidden area for a fight in such a 
position, but Yoko felt safe. She felt, accurately, that Jin Han Yong 
was unlike his brother. He was a boy who truly believed in honour, and 
would respect the promises that were made between the two of them. 

Jin spread his legs apart, leaned forward a little, and swung his arms 
in an exotic way, from side to side, up and down, just until his centre. 
Yoko brought up her fists and assumed her stance, to get this thing on 
the road. Though she wanted to enjoy a street fight with a worthy 
fighter, she still had Xiangau to think about. 

&#147;Yah!&#148;

Jin was the first to act. He shot inward for Yoko, pushing out his palm 
to strike. The girl was struck bluntly to the face. She backed up to 
gain some bearing his next action, but he was too fast. Jin threw the 
palm of the other arm straight into the stomach of Yoko, making he lean 
forward. Jin saw that as an opportunity, and acted. He hopped from the 
ground and led with his knee, which hit Yoko around the jaw squarely She 
was flung back by the head, sliding along the stone of the car park. 

&#145;He&#146;s fast&#133;&#146; Yoko thought, rubbing her chin. 

&#147;Hwaaaah!&#148; Jin came in again, this time leading with both arms at his 
side. His palm swiftly shot out from the left. Yoko sidestepped him, 
then spun around his side, her hair and body twirling magnificently. 
Before anyone knew it, she was behind him. That was the speed and 
elegance of her Angel Dance manoeuvre. Yoko crouched to the ground, her 
fingers touching the coolness of the stone floor beneath her. She span 
the front of her body around, her hands alternating positions to make 
way for both of her legs. Jin gasped as both of Yoko&#146;s sandaled feet 
swept him off his. The White Crow Gang grimaced as Jin Han Yong flopped 
to the soft stone floor. Yoko stepped back and waited for him to rise. 
She could have capitalized and attacked while he was on the ground, but 
Yoko thought better of it. Over-zealousness with an enemy whose style 
you were not familiar with wasn&#146;t optional. Nobuo had always taught her 
that. And this form of Kempo, &#145;Kuen Moo style&#146; as Jin called it, was 
unknown to Yoko. 

Jin stood up, and altered his fighting stance before attacking again. 
This time his charge was slower, and his hands were positioned closer to 
his shoulders. It was a tight position to attack from. But Yoko could 
not let that distract her. Jin Han Yung came forward and stepped inside, 
and thrust his fist at Yoko. The girl titled her head to the side, 
avoiding that shot at her, then tilted her head in the opposite 
direction to avoid the second. Before Jin withdrew it, Yoko grabbed his 
left arm, around the wrist, with her right hand. She pulled his arm to 
the side, then curled her leg between Jin&#146;s ankles and hooked her foot 
closely to the back of his. Yoko then pushed at him with her free arm, 
and tugged her leg back. She released his wrist while doing so, and the 
result led to Jin&#146;s back touching the floor once again. 

Jin blinked, looking down at the Yoko&#146;s ankles. From the surprise in his 
eyes, he didn&#146;t really expect to be bested by a woman. At least not by 
Yoko. Maybe it was time for&#133; &#145;that&#146; move. Jin rolled over his side to 
his stomach, then pressed his palms into the ground, tucking his knees 
under his body. Jin Han forced himself upright, turned around, and cast 
a cool smile at his opponent, the brave Yoko. The others in the group 
looked at this and smiled too. The only one whose face remained stoic 
was Liang. Apparently, his pride had been bruised by his defeat. Maybe 
he didn&#146;t want his brother to succeed where he had failed. 

&#147;Here it comes&#133;&#148; One of the surrounding men said.

Another at the side sneered. &#147;Jin Han Yung never fails with it.&#148;

Jin rolled up the elbows of his blue and silver outfit. Slowly at first. 
He cast his eyes at Yoko, who was still and prepared just a few metres 
ahead of him. &#147;You&#146;re a powerful fighter, Yoko. I must admit, I never 
expected that. Nor did I expect to be forced to use this move so early 
on in our fight. But like they say, necessity often makes for strange 
bedfellows.&#148;

&#147;What move&#133;?&#148;

Nobody said anything to answer her question. Jin Han took the time to 
nudge his head. The circle around the two fighters instantly got bigger, 
as the surrounding White Crow Gang backed up on Jin Hang Yung&#146;s command. 
That presented to Yoko that they knew what he was about to do. Jin Han 
stood still for a fleeting instant, then pulled up his hands. They moved 
slowly, and shook, the veins inside them raising as they throbbed with 
the blood that was now rapidly raging. Those spread fingers clenched 
together, and Jin slapped his hands together in front of his face, 
mimicking a man in deep prayer. Jin remained there, in that position, 
his body becoming more and more tense. It shook, his feet, legs, arms 
and head all shook, as the young man gathered power within himself. Yoko 
didn&#146;t know what was coming. It was probably more wise of her to attack 
him now rather than wait, but she was curious as to what would happen. 

&#147;Nggaaaaaaaaaaaaaah&#133;&#148;

Jun Han Yung growled like a focused beast as the trembling of his body 
was replaced by trembling in his hand. Seconds later, his hands pulled 
apart like a clamshell. The tips of his fingers still touched the tips 
of their opposites, including the thumb, forming an upside down diamond 
shape between his hands. A small ball of energy burst to life between 
them. Yoko blinked. What could this be? The ball of energy, a crystal 
blue, swirling and volatile, grew between Jin Han Yung&#146;s hands until it 
almost touched the very corners of them. Waves of dust blew away from 
Jin and through the circled group. There was a bright sheen that passed 
over the ball, and both Yoko and Jin Han knew what that meant. The young 
Chinese man alternated the position of his hands, then pulled them 
around to his right side. In one forceful push he projected both arms 
forward, screaming, 

&#147;Suishoudan!&#148;

Yoko gasped as a crystalline sphere of power came at her. It was too 
fast to avoid, too forceful to block. But she had no choice, that was 
the only way. Yoko stood her ground, crossed her arms over her face and 
defended. A burning sensation attacked her. The energy ball forced 
itself against Yoko&#146;s weaker defences, pressing against her arms with 
its hot, searing energy. It burned magnificently, trails of smoke rising 
from the point of connection. Yoko screamed as the energy scorched her, 
realizing that she should have risked dodging it. But it was too late to 
amend that error. Yoko was forced off her feet and driven straight 
through the crowds, as the cerulean energy ball rammed her with itself. 
Yoko tumbled along the ground, rolling over and over again until she 
stopped, lying in a bruised and burned clump The Suishoudan, the 
&#145;Crystal Shot&#146;, had struck again. Jin Han Yung looked on in disbelief, 
pleased with the effects of the Suishoudan, but confused at how Yoko 
could have managed to block it for that long. She even braved the 
burning of it till it overwhelmed her. What a courageous heart she had. 

Jin Han withdrew his hands, then stood straight, looking over at his 
crew. &#147;Someone. Go help her up.&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Asagawa Training Facility, Tokyo, Japan 

&#147;So&#133; it must be very odd for you to return here after so long.&#148;

Li Ming nodded to Nobuo. It was weird, in some ways. Though all of the 
students had moved on (aside from Yoko) it still felt like it had last 
year. Training with the others to master the teachings that Nobuo had to 
offer. Ever since her Uncle had told Li Ming of her destiny, she had yet 
to experience that kind of warmness again. That was why she was so 
thrilled to be back here after so much time. 

&#147;It is Nobuo-sama,&#148; Li Ming replied. &#147;I just wish some of the old 
students were here.&#148;

Both Li Ming and Nobuo were within the great hall of the Asagawa 
Training Facility. Li Ming had been touring the whole place over again, 
getting re-familiar with the sights, smells and sound of the place she 
once called home. And she had loved doing that, too. It was nice to 
re-connect with something you&#146;ve felt you&#146;ve lost. But, the place did 
have its fair share of changes Something Li Ming did not expect. Yoko 
was probably right about her. It might have been arrogant, but Li Ming 
expected everything to be the same when she returned But it hadn&#146;t. This 
world had been turning, even in her absence Suddenly she didn&#146;t feel 
like she was a part of it anymore And though that hurt, she knew there 
was no one to blame but herself. It was her choice to leave this place, 
hers and no one else&#146;s. 

Nobuo nodded &#147;They have all moved on. They feel that they have learned 
all they can from me. I suppose they may come back one day to show me 
what they learned and what they have improved on. Like you.&#148;

Li Ming nodded back to him. &#147;Yes. I have improved. Of course, it wasn&#146;t 
enough to defeat Yoko. She&#146;s really gotten a lot stronger.&#148;

&#147;Yes, a bit of a firecracker!&#148; Nobuo said in good humour. &#147;But she still 
has a long way to travel. As do you I am sure that the next time you 
face each other, you two will have improved a great deal.&#148; 

The doors at the back of the hall burst open. Nobuo and Li Ming looked 
around and gasped in urgency. Yoko was standing there, her body lit by 
the light of the outside splashing with the darkness of the hall. It 
showed off the results of her journey out to town. The knees of her 
jeans were sheared, revealing her grazed kneecaps. The front of Yoko&#146;s 
Valkyries tee shirt had been torn. But the most strident of injuries 
were the burn marks on her arms. Streaky lines of burned flesh fused in 
part by a radical source of heat. Yoko herself, in her face, looked 
tired. And both Nobuo and Li Ming knew that she had been fighting.

&#147;Yoko?&#148; Li Ming ran to her side, and checked to see if she was okay. 
&#147;Are you alright? What happened out there?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine&#133;&#148; Yoko said irritably. &#147;&#133;I got into a fight&#133; that&#146;s all&#133;&#148;

Nobuo sighed &#147;I think that is rather obvious, Yoko. Explain yourself.&#148;

What could she explain? That she got over-confident and took something 
too far? Yoko reprimanded herself already. She didn&#146;t need it from her 
grandfather or Li Ming. The girl turned her back to them both, with 
Xiangau&#146;s bandage bag still in her hands. &#147;It&#146;s over now. I don&#146;t want 
to think about it.&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

One by one, Yoko removed the dressings on the sleeping Xiangau&#146;s face, 
arms, legs and upper body. She clumped them all together, then tossed 
them in the bin at her bedside. She would have to empty that bin 
tomorrow morning, it was beginning to get a bit full. Now that those old 
bandages were out of the way, Yoko began applying the new, fresher ones 
to Xiangau&#146;s wounds. It was a slow, delicate process, but one that was 
done with great care and attention. Yoko set to work like a beaver 
building a damn, and eventually, she had accomplished her goal. Xiangau 
had almost twenty separate cuts to his body, and Yoko would have to 
change them everyday to keep infection from setting in, but she was 
happy to do it. Besides, it took her mind off other things. Like Jin.

Yoko shook her head. She didn&#146;t want to remember her defeat. But visions 
of it would not go away. And what was worse, was that Yoko could not 
understand why she had lost. She had the advantage. She floored Jin Han 
Yung more than once But he got right back up and resumed his attack. 
That&#133; energy wave&#133; Even now, Yoko could recall it. Even when she didn&#146;t 
want to. That hot streaming ball of energy. Constantly swirling, 
constantly burning. The heat singeing her arms, the force pushing her 
back. That was the terrible ruthlessness of energy waves. It allowed 
even weaker fighters to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. 

A knock came at the door. Somebody wanted to speak with her. &#147;Come in.&#148;

The door slid to one side, revealing Nobuo. Yoko looked away from him 
and back to Xiangau She could tell that he was ashamed by Yoko 
participating in such a frivolous fight Yoko didn&#146;t quite understand it 
herself. She thought that her brother Ryo was supposed to be the 
hot-headed half of the Asagawa-Siblings.  

&#147;Yoko.&#148; Nobuo spoke commandingly. 

She looked back at him, reluctantly. &#147;Yes sir?&#148;

&#147;Come with me.&#148;

She expected to be punished for getting involved in a fight for no 
reason. Something like cleaning the entire training hall by herself, or, 
market duties for a month. But why would she need to go with him to be 
told that? Yoko just shook her head and followed along, standing up and 
trailing after Nobuo as he left the room. She cast one more look at 
Xiangau before leaving, and then followed along. The two walked through 
the wooden floored hallway, before cut into the training garden. The 
stone clearing that Yoko came to every morning to practice her fighting 
techniques. Nobuo walked forward, toward the huge rock in the centre of 
the field. It was like a training dummy, for use with bokuto. Yoko 
didn&#146;t use the bokuto much, mostly because she didn&#146;t like using 
weapons. But it was an aspect of the Asagawa-style that her father 
Tsukasa had always told her to try at. 

But what did this have to do with punishment? &#147;What is this all about,  
Grandfather?&#148;

&#147;Yoko,&#148; He said. &#147;I want you to tell me exactly what happened.&#148;

She might as well have. It wasn&#146;t like it could get her in any more 
trouble &#147;I stepped out of here to get some new bandages for Xiangau I 
got to the market, bought some stuff, then came out. There were some 
guys there, they call themselves the White Crow Gang.&#148;

Nobuo ran a hand through his white beard. &#147;I have heard of them&#133; 
continue.&#148;

&#147;Well, they insulted me, calling me a&#133; I don&#146;t want to repeat it. But 
the point is, I couldn&#146;t let that go, so I punched one of them. Any 
other guy came to me, Liang Ho Yung I defeated him just as easily, but 
then his brother arrived&#133; his name was Jin Han Yung. He said if we had 
one last fight then the whole thing could be settled. At first I was 
winning, but then he pulled off a powerful technique&#133; an energy wave.&#148;

&#147;Well, that explains the burn marks.&#148; Nobuo said. &#147;But what made you 
think that attacking that man was warranted?&#148;

&#147;They insulted me!&#148; Yoko defended. &#147;You would have been angry too, if 
you heard what they called me! I just did what anyone else would!&#148;

Nobuo scowled &#147;Words! Words, Yoko! That was all it was. Just a 
feeble-minded person&#146;s idea of humour. You cannot use your power on 
people because you feel insulted. That&#146;s the kind of recklessness that 
breeds arrogance. You should fight to defend yourself from danger, not 
to create it. That was one of the first things I ever taught you.&#148;

Yoko hung her head lowly.  Now that she thought about it, Nobuo was 
right. It wasn&#146;t like the White Crow Gang could have forced her into 
anything. Maybe she should have held off on attacking them. At least 
until they attacked her first 

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, grandfather.&#148; Yoko said humbly.

&#147;Nevermind,&#148; Nobuo heaved a sigh. &#147;What&#146;s done is done. That is not why 
you are here.&#148; 

&#147;Then why am I here?&#148; She asked. 

Nobuo turned his back to Yoko, turning to the giant rock. &#147;I suspected 
that you had been defeated by an energy wave, as I have told you. I 
really hoped that I would not have to teach you one, being that they can 
be so destructive. But I think you&#146;ve learned a lesson about 
thoughtlessness today. I believe you are ready to learn the ability that 
your father and I fine tuned.&#148;

Yoko blinked &#147;W-What&#146;s that?&#148;

&#147;Watch closely&#133;&#148;

Nobuo pulled back. He stamped his feet to the ground, parting them by 
about half a metre. He gripped his hands into fists, then pulled them 
back to his sides, one after the other. His upper body leaned forward a 
bit, and he addressed Yoko while fixing himself into that assumed 
position of his. &#147;This is the stance Clear your mind, empty it of 
everything, your fears, your doubts, your confidence, even your memories 
of the fight so far. Think of nothing. Make your mind like a pool of 
water. Any pebble-like thought will make ripples that will ruin the 
tranquillity you need for this.&#148;

&#147;I understand.&#148; Yoko said.

Nobuo then shut his eyes. His body with completely and utterly still, 
calm and reserved. It was like he had become a part of the scenery, a 
void leaf in the quiet wind. &#147;Once you have become devoid of all 
emotion, you act.&#148;

Nobuo followed his instruction with action. He opened his fists and 
spread his palms, the fingertips pointing downwards. He drew his hands 
back even further, both turning into vertical positions as they came 
back. Then, in one smooth and continuous motion, Nobuo pushed both arms 
forward and roared.

&#147;Raaaaahhhhhh!&#148;

From his open hands surged a huge wave, a wave of fire, swirling around 
sharply like a drill The penetrating cluster of Chi-produced flames 
ripped through the air and headed sharply for the giant rock, leaving 
sparkling embers in its wake. The sphere of fire energy drilled into the 
stone, streams of flame turning like a wheel around the blast point. 
Yoko&#146;s mouth hung open in awe as the flames died down. They detached in 
falling shards of searing fire, leaving behind the products of their 
endeavour. A twirl-shaped crater had been cut into the face of that 
rock. Cracks spiralled outward from the epicentre, the inside of it 
blackened and smoking. This was the power of the Asagawa-style&#146;s 
trademark move, the Fire Wave. 

Nobuo retracted his still smoking hands. &#147;That is the Fire Wave.&#148;

&#147;H-How&#133; did you do that?&#148; Yoko asked, her eyes and voice showing her 
surprise. She would have never believed that Asagawa-style encompassed 
an energy wave. Let alone one that powerful&#133;

Nobuo began walking toward his chambers. &#147;That will be for you to figure 
out.&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Asagawa Training Facility, Tokyo, Japan 

&#147;Spread legs your legs. Bring your hands to sides. Assume the stance. 
Clear your mind. Make it free of all troubles. Then once your body has 
become devoid of all emotion&#133; Haaaah!&#148;

Yoko spread her legs further apart, shot her arms forward, opening her 
palms. But nothing happened Nothing at all. The most she seemed to be 
able to spark off was a slight puff of smoke. Aside from that, zero! And 
it was beginning to annoy her. Yoko sighed, then stood upright, wiping 
the sweat from her face. She had been practicing this move for over two 
days now, and still nothing. But she had to learn it. 

If nothing else, she would never have a chance against energy wave users 
unless she possessed one herself. And if she perfected something as 
powerful as the Fire Wave, then she would be a force to be reckoned 
with. Even more than that, she had to learn everything that the 
Asagawa-style had to offer. In one fight with Xiangau, Yoko had learn 
not to doubt herself. But it was because of that notion that Yoko had to 
learn this move. She needed confidence in herself, and maybe by learning 
the Fire Wave technique, there was a chance that Yoko could obtain that 
confidence. Though she was a different person to her father, Yoko did 
want to honour his memory by carrying on his style. And to do that, she 
would need to the of the herald of the Asagawa-style, the Fire Wave.

Yoko sighed again, then strode over to the training rock at which Nobuo 
had demonstrated the Fire Wave. She stood in awe of it. Pure, solid 
rock, that now had a twelve-inch deep crater inside it. That was very 
impressive. If you took it from a normal point of view. The energy 
produced by Fire Wave was so riotous that it could carve pure stone. 
There had to be some secret behind the Fire Wave. Something that Yoko 
wasn&#146;t understanding. But what? What could there possibly be that Yoko 
wasn&#146;t comprehending? After all, she was performing the opening gestures 
the exact same way as Nobuo had done two days ago&#133;

The Asagawa-girl backed up and drew in her hands again. She was going to 
learn this move even if it killed her. Just as she was about to attempt 
it again, someone stepped out from the sliding doors leading into the 
shrine innards. It was Li Ming.

&#147;Yoko,&#148; The Chinese woman said. &#147;Take a break.&#148;

Yoko looked over her shoulder. &#147;What is it? I really need the practice 
right now.&#148;

Li Ming smiled She had never known anyone as dedicated to bettering 
herself as Yoko. It was respectable in many ways. And in many ways, Li 
Ming hoped that she could someday look at fighting in that light. Still, 
what was happening now was a little bit more important.

The Chinese woman pointed behind her. &#147;Xiangau is waking up.&#148;

Well that was certainly worth ceasing the training for. Yoko&#146;s smile 
brightened, and she leapt from the rock she was standing by, to the 
inner veranda that Li Ming was standing at. That moment, she ran around 
the bend of the temple, through the wooden doors into the living spaces. 
She passed through the door, then ran inside and followed the corridor 
until she reached her room, the one Xiangau had been sleeping in. With 
Li Ming taking up the rear, Yoko slid open the door to her and went 
inside. 

And sure enough, sitting with his back against the bedpost, was Xiangau. 
His eyes looked red from continuous sleep, his hair was mess and his 
cheeks were flowered, but all in all he was fine. Yoko smile 
brilliantly.

&#147;Xiangau!&#148; She beamed. &#147;You&#146;re awake!&#148;

The young man&#146;s eyes tried to adjust to his surroundings. &#147;Where am I? 
What is&#133; this place&#133;?&#148;

&#147;This is the Asagawa Training Facility! You see, after our match at the 
God of Fighting Grand Championships, I woke up to find you out cold. I 
took you back to the complex, then when you wouldn&#146;t wake up, I decided 
that it was best for me to take you home. And&#133; this place is home.&#148;

&#147;The tournament&#133;?&#148; Xiangau&#146;s head felt hazy. But then, his mind reminded 
him of one little issue&#133; Reinhalt&#133; &#147;No! What about Reinhalt?! Where is 
he?!&#148;

Li Ming shook her head. &#147;What does he have to do with anything? And 
besides, I think you should be thanking Yoko. She didn&#146;t have to take 
you with us. Yet she&#146;s been at your side all this time. Do you realize 
that you have been out of commission for nearly a week?&#148;

Xiangau held a hand to his head. &#147;A&#133; week&#133;? Damn&#133; Mukasa&#133; and Reinhalt&#133; 
all of them are issues&#133; I need to stop Reinhalt&#133;&#148;

Yoko blinked &#147;Stop him from what?&#148;

&#147;I&#133;&#148; Xiangau didn&#146;t know just how to say it, but&#133; &#147;I&#133; I can&#146;t remember&#133;&#148;
