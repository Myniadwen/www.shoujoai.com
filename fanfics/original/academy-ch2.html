<h1>Academy Blues (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/academy-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Last time - The girls (Reika, Trina, Ami, Kismet &amp; Mi&#146;Shari) have 
taken a trip to a festival in a nearby valley to rest and relax, but 
they ended up doing anything but as they confront their own hidden 
fears and pasts, and are physically confronted by a new enemy and a 
strange threat to themselves and all around them as we enter Episode 
2---

A dark figure, garbed in black robes/armor, carrying a huge scythe, 
pulls itself out of the ground.

&#147;What the hell---?&#148; Reika whispers, transfixed by the sight before 
her. As she tried to pull herself together, one of the other girls was 
already on the offensive. &#147;Guide my hands---&#148; Kismet whispers, 
sketching complex symbols in the air as she switches tracks for a more 
offensive powered assault.

&#147;FIRE STRIKE!!&#148;

Kismet shoots off a volley of fire &#147;shots&#148;, each blazing through the 
warm air leaving a red trail in their wake as they blasted across the 
distance between Kismet &amp; the dark creature. Nimbly the creature leaps 
into the air, avoiding the shots as they pass beneath it, landing on 
the ground as the projectiles explode harmlessly behind it. Before 
Kismet can move, the dark creature is upon her, knocking her down with 
one strong swing of it&#146;s free arm crumpling her to the ground.

&#147;MAMA!!&#148; Ami screams, pulling a few arrows from a bow she confiscated 
from a nearby gaming booth to arm the bow. &#147;NO!!&#148; As the creature 
turns towards her it&#146;s riddled by quick volleys of arrows, each 
striking it throughout it&#146;s torso, head, arms and legs in quick 
strikes. As the arrows stop falling a dark shape falls over the 
creature, eclipsing what light fell on it as Trina attacks. Her tail, 
strong and sturdy, whips about and slams into the thing knocking it 
sideways through two tents and onto the ground senseless.

&#147;Oh tin-head!&#148;

As the dark creature looks up, it finds itself surrounded by a vast 
army of Mi&#146;Sharis. &#147;Still want to play with the big girls?&#148; With a 
dark snarl the thing leaps up, swinging it&#146;s scythe wildly, shattering 
illusions as it goes. &#147;Nope. Nuh-uh. Too slow! Come on! You can swing 
better than that!&#148;

As Mi&#146;Shari bounces and dances backwards letting her illusions take 
the brunt of it&#146;s attacks, the shadow creature grows more and more 
frustrated with her avoidance tactics. Suddenly Mi&#146;Shari changes 
directions and rushes straight forward, lashing out with a rapid 
attack of kicks and punches to the head and body to keep it off 
balance as she wails on it hard and fast. As the creature stumbles, 
she grabs it by the scruff of it&#146;s neck armor and turns to Reika, 
&#147;REIKA!!&#148;

Reika, sword at the ready nods, watching as the shadow is thrown 
towards her. She slashes it hard ripping into armor and cloak messing 
it&#146;s &#147;body&#148; up abit as it passes her. With one kick she sends it 
towards Ami, &#147;AMI!&#148;

Ami, hands together, quickly sketches out a few spell words as she 
powers, catching the dark shadow as it stumbles towards her in a power 
blast throwing it forward. &#147;TRINA!&#148;

Trina, floating above the ground looking down casually, takes a brief 
look at the shadow as she takes a deep breath (stoking the energy 
within her being) to power up. With one long exhale, she launches her 
energy attack vaporizing the creature where it stands, blasting a 
giant hole into the ground at the same time, causing the ground to 
shudder under her tremendous attack power.

Their tormentor was nowhere to be found, all his forces laying in ruin 
he didn&#146;t wait for the end.

But while he was gone, he had not forgotten them---

------

From a shadowy place a distance away they watched what transpired back 
at the festival.

&#147;Not bad. Not bad at all.&#148; he remarks, watching the girls gather 
around their injured friend as they caught their collective breathes, 
&#147;These girls are tougher than I thought. They may prove to be as 
worthy a challenge as the original four. Don&#146;t you agree my lord?&#148;

In the darkness of the main chamber, a dark figure with glowing red 
eyes watched.

&#147;We&#146;ll see.&#148;

-----

&#147;Kismet? Kismet--- oh goddess--- Kismet.&#148; Ami whimpered, holding 
Kismet close as she slowly opened her eyes. &#147;Kis---?&#148; (a gentle finger 
pressed to Ami&#146;s lips shushes her, and a gentle kiss brings a smile to 
her lips)

&#147;Yeah! She&#146;s alright!&#148; Mi&#146;Shari cheered, &#147;Now I don&#146;t have to pay her 
medical bills!&#148;

Reika - &#147;---geez, your all heart aintcha&#146;.&#148;

As the three leave Ami/Kismet to talk, Ami blushes, &#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148; she 
whispered, &#147;I---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be.&#148; Kismet assured her, holding her tight. &#147;It was an 
accident. Still---&#148; (looking over Ami&#146;s shoulder at the others) &#147;---I 
don&#146;t think they&#146;re ready to know how close we are yet, lover.&#148;

&#147;That I&#146;d fall in love with my---&#148;

&#147;Shh---&#148; Kismet kisses her again, &#147;---you were precious to me before 
we were lovers, way back when---&#148; (smiles) &#147;---when I used to call you 
daughter, precious lover of mine.&#148;

&#147;Mama---&#148;

&#147;Precious---&#148;

The roar of cheering people catch the two&#146;s attention as they turn, 
amazed that everyone that was still about (and haven&#146;t fled the 
festival ground) were cheering the girls&#146; victory over the darklings.

Mi&#145;shari was soaking in the applause. &#147;Thank you, thank you. Your too 
kind! Thank you! My loving fans! I&#146;m deeply toched!&#148;

&#147;In the head---&#148; Reika hissed beneath her breath, blushing at the 
attention they were getting.

&#147;What a friendly mob of noisy grateful people---&#148; Trina remarks, 
changing back to her humanoid form as she did, &#147;They won&#146;t bite, will 
they?&#148;

Kismet allows Ami to take her away from the crowds to find a silent 
place to sit and talk.

&#147;We did it.&#148; Kismet whispers, holding Ami close as they watch the 
festival from a perch under a huge mallow tree on a hill above the 
festivities. &#147;Did you have any doubt that we could?&#148;

&#147;No. Of course not precious! Just worried, that&#146;s all. Mommy&#146;s got the 
right to be worried.&#148;

&#147;Mama.&#148;

&#147;So I&#146;m a tad naughty. Forgive me!&#148; Kismet admits, resting her head on 
Ami&#146;s shoulder as they watched the people below start the party again. 
&#147;Ami-chan---&#148;

&#147;We did it. I think we can really have a chance of making the cut on 
graduation and ranking high when we leave the Academy. It&#146;d be nice if 
we got there without the youths beaten out of us though---&#148;

&#147;Your so negative at times!&#148; (Kismet takes a stuffed dragon toy out of 
her magic pouch (which she won for Ami as a gift) and begins thumping 
the surprised girl on her head with it) &#147;Cr&egrave;me-May here says &#147;stop 
it&#148;! Stop being such a stick in the mud!&#148;

&#147;Hey! Mama! Cut it out! I&#146;m sorry! I give!&#148;

&#147;Come on now! Smile for mama! Stop being such a stuffy girl and 
smile!&#148;

&#147;OK!! OK!! I give! I give! Have mercy!&#148; (Ami smiles, warming Kismet up 
watching her precious lover grace her with the uplifting presence of 
her happy visage). &#147;Now there&#146;s the girl I fell in love with!&#148; (Kismet 
pushes the stuffed dragon into Ami&#146;s arms with a smirk on her face) 
&#147;Just so you know I&#146;m only stopping because you begged so nicely!&#148;

&#147;Anything for you, my mistress.&#148;

&#147;Oh so NOW I&#146;m your mistress?&#148; (Kismet cuffs Ami lightly) &#147;Mama&#146;s 
enough for you, young lady! I don&#146;t want to have you screaming 
&#147;MISTRESS!!&#148; next time I get hurt. I&#146;ll have a hard enough time 
explaining &#147;MAMA!&#148; to them later.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry---&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be.&#148; (holds Ami&#146;s head up and kisses her) &#147;I don&#146;t regret our 
feelings. But they just won&#146;t understand it--- yet--- maybe one day.&#148;

&#147;I love you---&#148;

The two kiss, holding each other tight as they do.

The party lasts all night, and the girls return early in the morning 
back to the Academy grounds.

------

&#147;What time is it?&#148; Reika growls lazily, rolling over to try and find 
the clock by her bed.

&#147;I&#146;d help you---&#148; Trina moans, &#147;---but a naked girl&#146;s on my back.&#148;

&#147;Your naked too so give me a break. First time we made love was so 
tiring! Let&#146;s do it again---&#147; (looks about in a daze for something) 
&#147;Anyway I guess that&#146;s why the bed feels all fluffy all of the sudden, 
your furry wings and all--- they &#147;unfolded&#148; again in your sleep.&#148; A 
free hand finally hit&#146;s the clock, nearly sending it off the 
nightstand before another hand grabs it and reels it in. &#147;Let&#146;s 
see---&#148; (looks at time) &#147;---OH MY GOD!!!&#148;

&#147;Agh!&#148; Trina yelps, covering her ears with her hands, &#147;Not so loud! 
It&#146;s early and I&#145;m trying to &#147;fold&#148; my wings in peace and---&#148;

&#147;NOT THAT EARLY!!&#148; Reika yells, jumping out of bed, &#147;I have a math 
test this morning!&#148;

&#147;Why teach math in a school of magic?&#148; (Trina sighs, her wings 
disappearing into her back)

&#147;We&#146;re supposed to be well rounded in both the arts of science, maths, 
languages and magics. Mathematics is one of those skills we have to 
learn!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t yell it in my ear then---&#148; Trina sighs, rubbing her ears with 
the open palms of her hands, &#147;The screaming hurts badly.&#148;

-----

&#147;Come back to bed, precious---&#148; Kismet yawns, pulling the sheets back 
up to warm herself.

&#147;I can&#146;t! I&#146;m supposed to be in science class in a little while!&#148;

&#147;Urgh.&#148; (sighs) &#147;I guess I have classes too so I might as well get 
up---&#148; (with a disgusted growl Kismet leaves the warmth of her bed and 
starts foraging for fresh clothes) &#147;---why couldn&#146;t the festival have 
been on a Saturday and gave us a day to recover from the partying?&#148; 
Kismet finds her spell-link in a pile of clothes the two discarded in 
a rush to make love, picking it up she flips open the device and 
speaks into it. &#147;Mi&#146;Shari NamoCatCat.&#148;

Seconds later the link connects, &#147;Yes?&#148; the groggy voice on the other 
end answers.

&#147;Wake up, it&#146;s time for classes.&#148;

&#147;Ah, my clone card can handle school today for me.&#148; Mi&#146;Shari grumbles, 
the sound of her rolling over as she pulls the sheets up obvious to 
Kismet. &#147;Lazy girl. Get up!&#148;

`&#147;I think I&#146;ll sleep in today. Get back in bed, lover, and we&#146;ll---&#148;

&#147;Pretty kitty needs to learn something. Out you go.&#148;

The sound of the tall blonde human pulling Mi&#146;Shari out of bed and 
towards the bathing room was obvious, especially with Mi&#146;Shari 
struggling every step of the way. &#147;I DON&#146;T WANNA! ONE DAY WON&#146;T HURT 
ME ANY!! NO! COME ON! I DON&#146;T WANNA STUDY! I&#146;M TIRED!&#148;

Kismet shuts the link and sighs, &#147;She&#146;ll never learn.&#148;

-----

Reika could almost swear the numbers were mocking her. Laughing at her 
messed up condition.

&#147;Wish I stood in bed with Trinny after all---&#148; she grumbled, juggling 
more and more numbers as she worked to finish her test. &#147;If I get at 
least half right even I&#146;d be surprised.&#148;

------

Ami busies herself with her task, today&#146;s class being simple chemistry 
lessons. She picked up another chemical tube and began to mix it, 
thinking fondly of Kismet and--- &#147;Focus, Ami. Focus.&#148;

&#147;Oh?&#148; Ami suddenly comes back to reality, finishing her mix and 
stirring it with a steady flow of wrist movements to swirl the 
contents together. &#147;Finished. That wasn&#146;t so---&#148;

The resulting explosion knocks everyone backwards onto their butts.

&#147;---bad.&#148; Ami sighs, throwing the blackened and broken test tube into 
the recycling bin. &#147;Sigh.&#148; As she stands up, Ami carefully leans 
against the desk she was working on while somebody retrieves the 
chairs from the far end of the room. &#147;Maybe I should lower my 
expectations to something easier--- bunny girl at a strip club is a 
good start.&#148; With a disappointed huff (and a puff of smoke), Ami goes 
to work cleaning up.

-----

Kismet wasn&#146;t having a good day either.

She lacked focus, and her spells were a little shoddy.

She &#147;curved&#148; a few cannon gun spell-trajectories causing students to 
scatter in a panic.

She couldn&#146;t form a clear &#147;nova shield&#148; without the spell breaking 
from her disoriented state.

And she unintentionally awakened the slow romantic fires between a 
male and female school office worker that&#146;s been simmering over 58 
dates the past nine months one floor beneath her class and they were 
already talking about marriage five minutes after Kismet&#146;s botched 
metallic object attraction spell turned into a romantic attraction 
spell on the two in question. She finally had to be sent to the 
Nurse&#146;s Office to sleep off her tired state.

&#147;Boring.&#148; Kismet sighed. Everyone was in class, she couldn&#146;t reach 
Ami&#146;s mind with her&#146;s because Ami was too focused on studies to let 
Kismet telepathically &#145;touch&#146; her thoughts. Even the nurse was no fun 
because, though she was a lesbian, she was happily married to a 
beautiful woodland nymph (who worked as the school gardener and 
maintained the topiary on campus).

&#147;Maybe there&#146;s something on Vision Net.&#148;(*)

Putting on the headset and laying back, Kismet closes her eyes and 
turns the net on.

A super deformed little girl (green hair), dressed in her school 
uniform and a black cape, stands on top of a typical Japanese school 
building in a dramatic pose while holding a red rose and looking far 
too Tuxedo Kamen-ish for her own good.

&#147;Yaaoooohhhh! NENE!&#148; (chink!) &#147;QUEEN OF EVERYTHING!&#148;

&#145;Oh not this show!&#146; Kismet growls to herself in her thoughts, &#145;I hate 
this show!&#146;

Credits - 2002 by Cherry Blossom Anime. A Daidouji/Kotobuki 
Production.

&#145;Figures they show junk in the Nurse&#146;s Room. Gives you an incentive to 
stop being sick.&#146;

&#147;Today - Episode 2! Nene&#146;s Lovely Girlfriend!&#148;

&#145;God sakes&#146; I&#146;d rather die than sleep through this--- (yawn)--- maybe 
I will sleep through this.&#146;

Somehow Kismet manages to fall asleep with the episode blaring in her 
mind.

Commercial Break

Over the city of Tokyo, the gigantic monster Marth-zilla raged, 
devastating the city by forcing others to do the hard work while she 
talked too much.

(bad voice dubbing) &#147;Look out--- it&#146;s the monster--- Marth-zilla! She 
is--- asking The Rock--- to demonstrate--- how to destroy--- Tokyo---

-----

A few hours later.

&#147;So how was everyone&#146;s day?&#148; Trina asked, looking about the lunch 
table at everyone.

From the looks on their faces, things didn&#146;t go well for any of them.

&#147;That bad, huh?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know--- I could have done without the standing in the hallway 
after I lost my cool after turning in my test and started ranting 
about the numbers mocking me.&#148;

&#147;---something exploded--- three times--- but I finally got the knack 
of making strawberry kool-aid.&#148;

&#147;An essential skill for up and coming Judgments I&#146;m sure.&#148; Kismet 
sighed, &#147;I think we&#146;re going to be invited to the wedding of Craig &amp; 
Elisa in a few weeks. We better go shopping soon for clothes.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t know they were going to get married.&#148; Reika remarked.

&#147;What a difference a screwed up attraction spell will do, eh?&#148;

&#147;---oh---&#148;

Mi&#145;Shari yawns as she pokes at her food nonchalantly. &#147;I hated my 
classes! Everyone kept looking at my tail and asking if I was in heat 
or something because it was standing up all the time.&#148; (phht) &#147;My tail 
does that when I&#146;m stressed, not when I&#146;m---&#148;

Reika - &#147;We get the point, thanks ever so for that bad imagery of you 
I just got in my head.&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s not party again on a Sunday,&#148; Trina puts out, &#147;who&#146;s for that?&#148;

Everyone raises their hands. &#147;We&#146;ll all forget about it the next time 
a party situation comes up.&#148; Mi&#146;shari points out, &#147;You all know that.&#148;

&#147;Then we&#146;ll swear off partying again until next party.&#148; Reika 
counters, &#147;Where&#146;s the wakey-wakey pills we sent for? They should be 
here by now---&#148; (turns to look at a student passing her by looking at 
her oddly) &#147;---take a picture, it&#146;ll last longer.&#148;

Ami, meanwhile, had taken out one of her study books and flipped 
through it while everyone was talking. &#147;Darklings.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148; Reika mumbles, head turning towards Ami in a rather sluggish 
manner. &#147;What---?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s what we fought yesterday. Darklings. It&#146;s here in my Judgment 
guidebook of---&#148;

&#147;Shit!&#148; Mi&#146;shari suddenly snaps, &#147;It&#146;s the Principal! Act normal!&#148;

Everyone looks over at Reika, nearly falling asleep on the table. 
&#147;Easy for you to say.&#148;

Ms. Winters, a young looking (but older than she looks) human stops by 
the girls&#146; table. &#147;So how are things? Doing well? You recovered yet 
from that Darkling mess yesterday because I brought those wakers you 
ordered from the Nurse&#146;s Office.&#148;

&#147;Gee, thanks I---&#148; (Kismet blinks a few times in confusion)

&#147;You&#146;re not the only one who went to the Festival, you know. I saw 
your work, great job. And you made it to class on time too today. 
Excellent even though some of you couldn&#146;t keep awake for the class.&#148;

Everyone&#146;s attention (except Ami&#146;s) turns to Kismet. &#147;What?! 
Embarrassed to pick your friend up at the Nurse&#146;s Office? Sheesh! Some 
friends you are!&#148;

&#147;That reminds me---&#148; (Ms. Winters clears her throat) &#147;---you know 
about the school event, right?&#148;

&#147;What school event?&#148; everyone asks (including people on other tables 
who were listening in) &#147;The 1st Annual Lover&#146;s Valentine Weekend being 
thrown by the school founder.&#148;

&#147;But Valentine&#146;s day is months away!&#148;

&#147;Not on NekoChania (the Neko homeworld) it isn&#146;t. Lover&#146;s Day is 
coming up and the founder want to spread the joys of love to the 
students of the school!&#148;

Kismet &amp; Ami blush, so does Reika &amp; Trina. Everyone then turns towards 
Mi&#146;shari. &#147;WHAT?!? My significant other is in class right now, 
alright? I can&#146;t moon over her on cue so shove it already!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t forget! By the way, your supposed to give a tribute of love to 
the one you devoted your heart to so don&#146;t forget to go gift shopping 
before the weekend!&#148;

&#147;But that&#146;s FIVE days away!&#148;

&#147;Four, you don&#146;t count today because you&#146;ll never get free time with 
classes, and study, and meals and so forth in time to visit the good 
shops before they close today. Remember to do it before Saturday! 
Stock up on &#147;you know what&#148; and be prepared to tribute your lover 
heavily!&#148;

&#147;Dammit!&#148; Reika grumbles, &#147;Isn&#146;t once a year enough?&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t live through TWO Valentine&#146;s Day/White Day style holidays a 
year!&#148; Mi&#146;Shari gripes.

&#147;Kismet? You&#146;ll---&#148;

&#147;Trust in your lover, as I trust in you---&#148; Kismet whispers, gazing 
into Ami&#146;s eyes.

&#147;I heard about these plans in advanced.&#148; Trina remarks as the 
principal leaves.

&#147;You did? Then why didn&#146;t you tell us about it?&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t think they&#146;d go through with it.&#148; (sighs) &#147;It&#146;s like 
Valentine&#146;s Day/White Day but on caffeine and juiced up ten notches. 
It&#146;s when lovers trade gifts (tributes) to show their affections 
towards each other. Lover&#146;s Day started back in Nekochanian history 
when birth rates were low and the government wanted to prod more 
couplings to---&#148;

&#147;This is beginning to sound like a documentary on love! Skip to the 
good stuff!&#148; Kismet hisses.

&#147;Tomorrow the school is opening a big booth for buying tributes of 
love in the school shop. They&#146;ve been planning and stocking up for 
this since Summer break. This is of course for those who are in love 
with someone. People who are still looking---&#148;

&#147;Which isn&#146;t any of us.&#148; Reika remarks, looking about the table, 
&#147;Unless you love life with the golly Amazonian gal is going south.&#148;

&#147;There&#146;s NOTHING wrong with me and Kira! We&#146;re just fine thank you 
ever so!&#148;

&#147;Couldva fooled me since she didn&#146;t show up---&#148;

&#147;What&#146;d I miss?&#148; Kira asks as the tall, 6&#146;1&#148; Amazonian (waves upon 
waves of long golden hair rolling down her shoulders to the small of 
her back) walks in on the girls as they&#146;re talking. &#147;We&#146;re talking 
about Lover&#146;s Day and they think I&#146;m in trouble with you.&#148;

Rika smiles, and kisses Mi&#146;Shari passionately, &#147;Your fine.&#148;

&#147;---I think I&#146;m going to be sick---&#148; Reika whispers, to which Trina 
leans over confused, &#147;Why? That looked cute.&#148;, &#147;Do you know what 
Amazonians are like sexually?&#148;

&#147;No. Is it important?&#148;

&#147;----never mind----&#148;

On their way out of the Dining Area, Kismet makes a strange 
observation. &#147;Well, it could be worst than us just trying to make our 
loves take note of us.&#148;

&#147;How so, Kissy?&#148; Reika asks.

Meanwhile, on Terra (Earth&#146;s Dream Moon) (CCSakura Remastered II)

&#147;PLEASE! Let&#146;s reconsider this! Come on!&#148;

&#147;Let go Sakura! It&#146;s only a box of mac nut chocolates, Tomoyo&#146;s 
favorite chocolate drink mixes, and a bear in a costume with a gushy 
sweet card!! Celebrate &#147;Lover&#146;s Day&#148; like a woman dammit! (I only wish 
Tomoyo wasn&#145;t away on a business trip so you could do this in 
person!)&#148;

&#147;Stop! Please! She&#146;ll think I&#146;m childish! I don&#145;t want to insult her!&#148;

&#147;Sakura Kinomoto let go of me this instant! I---&#148; (chokes) &#147;---GET OFF 
MY BACK!!&#148;

&#147;Please Nina DON&#146;T DO IT!! I&#146;m sorry I said it! I don&#146;t want to be 
childish! I want to be a grown woman! I want to be mature for 
Tomo-chan! DON&#146;T DO THIS!!&#148;

&#147;You want to be an adult? Fine! GROW UP THEN AND GET OFF MY BACK!!&#148;

The two enter the post office, struggling through the door as they 
enter.

&#147;Will she get it on time? Is there enough postage? She won&#146;t be mad, 
right? Right?

&#147;SHE&#146;LL LOVE IT FOR GOD&#146;S SAKE! I&#146;m only pissed you can&#146;t be a woman 
about this!&#148;

(mails off box and finally manages to pry Sakura off her back)

&#147;Next time put it in her hand yourself.&#148;

&#147;But she won&#146;t like it if---&#148;

&#147;I give up already!&#148; (collapses from lack of air) &#147;---roll me over, 
I&#146;m dead---&#148;

------

Back to the Academy as night falls and Kismet walks in on Ami as she 
sits at her desk in the joint room they share, facial expression as if 
she was a million miles away in thought.

&#147;Thinking deep thoughts?&#148;

&#147;No. I&#146;m just thinking about us--- what I can give you for---&#148;

&#147;Anything&#146;s fine with me. You know me already precious---&#148; (sits down 
on bed smiling) &#147;I&#146;m easy to please when you get right down to it.&#148;

Suddenly Ami grows quiet, her voice a whisper, &#147;I didn&#145;t do enough to 
protect you , Meh&#146;ai. I wish I was stronger.&#148;

&#147;Your stronger than you think, precious. We both know in our hearts 
how strong you are.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t do enough. I let that thing hurt you. I felt so angry, but 
more at myself than it--- I---&#147;

&#147;You worry far too much about me for your own good, lover.&#148;

&#147;Not enough if I&#146;m going to be a lover worthy of you. Be able to 
protect you.&#148;

&#147;Flattering me gets you everywhere, especially in bed!&#148; Kismet jokes 
briefly, becoming serious again seconds later. &#147;Listen to you! Your 
far too concerned about your own mother for your own good! I can take 
care of myself, dearest. I didn&#146;t get to be this age if I didn&#146;t know 
a few tricks to protect myself with--- still, there are times I wish I 
could be younger, so I could be a better lover to you too.&#148;

&#147;Meh&#145;ai.&#148;

&#147;Precious.&#148; Both sit and stare for the longest time, uncertain what to 
say. &#147;See?&#147; Kismet finally remarks, breaking the silence, &#147;Now you got 
me all serious mode and stuff! Come on---&#147; (holds her arms out) &#147;Let&#146;s 
just make love and forget about what happened earlier today.&#147;

&#147;I don&#146;t know if---&#147;

&#147;Shhh.&#147; (two fingers gently and firmly hold Ami&#146;s lips as Kismet draws 
near) &#147;It&#146;ll fade in time. Just let me make it all better. I&#146;m good at 
doing things like that, like a mother should for her precious love.&#147;

Ami nods, allowing Kismet to kiss her as she uses a little magic to 
dim the lights.

As she kisses Ami the two begin to remove their clothing---

Reika stares on as the book flaps it&#146;s pages for the umpteenth time.

&#147;Stop staring at me. I&#146;m done, alright? Good night.&#148;

With a slight shake the book jumps off of the desk and back into it&#146;s 
part of the bookshelf, putting itself away until next time it comes 
out for an entry. &#147;Damn uppity book, hate those things---&#148;

&#147;Come to bed, Rei-chan. Burn the book tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;You burn it. Take it down and give it a fry with your breath.&#148; Reika 
glibly comments as she slides into bed, pulling the sheets over 
herself, &#147;That better not be a remark about my morning breath, 
Rei-chan!&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not---&#148; (kisses Trina on the lips) &#147;---good night.&#148;

&#147;Good night. Don&#146;t let the bed bugs bite.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t let your tail &#147;come out&#148; during the night and spank me while 
your at it.&#148;

Trina turns with a genuinely surprised expression on her face, &#147;I said 
I was sorry!&#148;

&#147;Perfectly nice fantasy too, until the tail picked up speed and 
started paddling me too hard.&#148;

&#147;I apologized already! I even made up for that!&#148;

&#147;I did like the way you made up though---&#147; (mischievous grin) &#147;Let&#146;s 
&#145;make up&#146; again tomorrow. Anyway, it still looks awkward going to 
class while walking crooked, people are starting to think we have 
kinky bedroom antics before bed!&#148;

&#147;Hmph!&#148; (Trina huffs her breath rolling over to face Reika) &#147;Straight 
girl/girl lovemaking ISN&#146;T kinky! I mean---&#148; (blinks as Reika motions 
towards her rear) &#147;---oh. They think we do the S&amp;M thing--- oh.&#148; 
(blushes) &#147;I&#146;ll keep from sprouting my tail while sleeping. Promise.&#148;

&#147;Alright---&#148; Reika cuddles up into Trina&#146;s strong arms, and begins to 
nod off, &#147;Goodnight, lover.&#148;

&#147;Goodnight, Rei-chan.&#148;

As Reika falls asleep in the dragon-girl&#146;s arms, she sighs and closes 
her eyes, &#147;My tail just can&#146;t resist your beautiful rear end, that&#146;s 
all. Don&#146;t blame it if your too much in shape for your own good.&#148;

&#147;&#146;eard that.&#148; Reika mutters in her sleep.

&#147;Drats.&#148;

Enhancement notes (Academy Blues Episode 2)

(*) - Vision Net. Sorta like TV for &#147;sleeping&#148;. Since nobody truly 
dreams in the Realm of Dreams, it&#146;s an escape for those who miss 
dreaming (mostly for those who used to be alive and passed over after 
death, or those who want to experience what dreams might be like in 
this psuedo manner.)
