<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 16 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>      &quot;It&#39;s been a few hours and I bet she&#39;ll eat now,&quot; Isaka said, holding a new try of 
food. Tsuru looked up at her.

      &quot;What makes you so sure of that?&quot;

      &quot;Well, she&#39;s a lot like that dog, scared and hurt. When I tried to feed it, it did the 
exact same thing she did and my older sister told me to leave it be. Chances are that girl 
is starving and I doubt she&#39;ll be in the mood to attack us,&quot; Isaka said, heading into the 
room.

      Tsuru looked over at the girl who did seem tired, curled up on the floor. She seemed 
to have given up on escaping. Isaka sat down next to her and the girl didn&#39;t scoot away. 
Instead, she spied the food suspiciously and Isaka happily held out a slice of an apple, 
albeit with bandaged fingers.

      This time, the girl took it, much to Tsuru&#39;s relief. She ate, looking miserable all 
the while. Isaka just smiled and continued to feed the girl. The trouble came when Isaka 
gave her the glass to drink out of. Instead of swallowing, she proceeded to spit it all out 
at the demon.

      Tsuru held in her laughter as Isaka let out a long sigh. &quot;Listen here... I know you 
understand human speech perfectly since you told us to stay away. This is the only glass of 
water you get tonight and if you want to waste it, go ahead. But I highly recommend you 
drink it.

      And the girl did drink it the second time. 

***** 

      &quot;Is there a guest room I can stay at?&quot; Tsuru asked Isaka, leaning against the doorway 
of the demon&#39;s bedroom.

      &quot;Guest room? Surely you jest?&quot; Isaka said, removing some of her clothes. She told 
Tsuru it was because she was going to take a bath, but the blue haired girl was positive 
that it was just to be a tease. &quot;You&#39;re going to spend the night with me, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

      &quot;Sorry Isaka, but no,&quot; Tsuru turned away as the demon pulled her into the room.

      &quot;Come on, Tsuru! When was the last time you got some? You&#39;re abusing you&#39;re body by 
not letting it have what it wants...&quot; Isaka smirked as she ran a finger over Tsuru&#39;s lips. 
She&#39;d recently unbandaged it and &#39;accidentally&#39; reopened the bite wounds.

      Tsuru flinched at the scent of it, trying not to look at the beautiful, half naked 
woman in front of her. She was a weakling and turned towards the demon. Isaka gave her a 
bright smile and proceeded to slip her index finger in Tsuru&#39;s mouth.

      For a second, she forgot why she never liked to drink blood and grabbed her hand to 
suckle on it. Isaka led her to the bed and started to undo the top buttons on Tsuru&#39;s 
jacket. So much for a bath...

      Isaka had withdrawn her fingers and started to place kisses on Tsuru&#39;s neck-

      When screaming from their honored &#39; guest&#39; rang out. Tsuru froze and didn&#39;t hesitate 
to come to her sense and shove the demon away. &quot;What was that?&quot;

      Isaka gave her a furious look, knowing Tsuru was just using the scream as an excuse to 
get out of having sex... and she&#39;d almost had her too!

      Tsuru, still tasting the blood in her mouth, realized that if she stayed in the room 
any longer that she would be tempted to go back into Isaka&#39;s arms. She didn&#39;t want to be her 
little plaything, so...

      &quot;I need to go check it out, Isaka!&quot; Tsuru said with mock worry and quickly dashed out 
of the room.

      &quot;Tsuru! You flipping tease! You can&#39;t leave me like this...!&quot; Isaka whined out, the 
fading sound of Tsuru&#39;s footsteps her only reply.

      The screaming continued, dissolving into sobs and moans. Tsuru slowed down as she 
approached the door and opened it. In the darkness, she could hear the rattling chain and 
the shadowy figure of the girl tossing and turning.

      Was she having a nightmare?

      &quot;Hey, it&#39;s okay, you&#39;re safe...&quot; Tsuru said, trying to soothe the girl. She touched 
her and was rewarded by being clawed at. Tsuru  grabbed the girl into a hug while she was 
pummeled and kicked at.

      After a while, the girl calmed down and just cried against her chest. &quot;I&#39;m not a 
monster...! I&#39;m not a monster!&quot;

      Tsuru quietly rocked her back and forth, startled when she felt another pair of arms 
wrapped around the girl. &quot;Shh, you&#39;re fine,&quot; she heard Isaka say.

      Eventually, the girl settled back down into a restless sleep, being held by the two 
other women. Tsuru&#39;s image of the demon had vastly improved! ...well, until...

      &quot;Gah!&quot; Tsuru almost shouted out in surprise, causing a slight stir from the girl. 
Isaka had proceeded to reach over the silver haired girl to fondle her. &quot;Isaka! What the 
hell are you doing?&quot; she hissed out.

      &quot;I&#39;m still horny, Tsuru! Come on... please?&quot;

      &quot;We are not doing this right next to this girl!&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s not like she&#39;s going to wake up!&quot;

      &quot;But this is her bed!&quot;

      &quot;We can just change the pillows and blanket for her in the morning...&quot;

      &quot;W-wait... why are you - don&#39;t come over here! Stay on your side of the magic circle!&quot;

      How the girl slept through that exchange was beyond Tsuru. 

***** 

      Krystal looked confused. &quot;So that was Tycara when you found her? But she&#39;s so...&quot;

      Isaka shrugged. &quot;It was pretty challenging. Eventually we got her name out of her and 
she started to trust us more. We treated her like a sister and let her out of the room,&quot; the 
demon said, with a happy sigh. &quot;I&#39;m glad at how much she&#39;s grown. It was really sad, all the 
things those people did to her...&quot;

      The exorcist went over and gave her demon a kiss. &quot;But why does Tsuru hate you so 
much? The two of you got along fine when you were taking care of Tycara, right?&quot;

      Isaka&#39;s smile faltered. &quot;Ha... ha... well... Krystal you have to promise you won&#39;t be 
mad!&quot; the demon suddenly exclaimed, taking her lover&#39;s hands into her own. &quot;I love you more 
than anything, okay? So you have to... just don&#39;t get mad... I did... something really bad 
to Tsuru that she still hasn&#39;t gotten over and I still think she shouldn&#39;t be mad, but oh, 
Krystal-!&quot;

      &quot;Just tell me the story...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Tsuru, Tsuru! I made this for you!&quot; The blue haired girl turned to see Tycara jogging 
with a bouquet of flowers.

      &quot;Huh? Oh thanks!&quot; She took them with a blush.

      &quot;Aren&#39;t they pretty? There&#39;s a whole meadow of lilies over there that Isaka showed me 
the other day,&quot; Tycara replied. It had already been a couple of years since they first 
fought the girl, but now she was chipper and happy... if not a bit childish, but Tsuru and 
Isaka didn&#39;t mind.

      Tsuru tried not to blush as the girl linked arms with her. &quot;Do you want to go see?&quot;

      As she allowed herself to be tugged away, she saw Isaka out of the corner of her eye. 
Was it just her or was the demon grinning? 

***** 

      &quot;Tycara was telling me how she wanted to go see the waterfall,&quot; Isaka said 
spontaneously to Tsuru. The two of them were currently out on the patio and Tycara was 
taking a nap inside. &quot;Why don&#39;t you take her tonight?&quot;

      &quot;Alright, are you going to come with us?&quot; Tsuru asked, trying to hide her excitement 
at spending more time with the girl.

      &quot;No, no... I have some stuff to deal with, you know? New demon settlement up in the 
north needs some help setting up trade,&quot; Isaka said, with that same grin. Tsuru knew exactly 
what she was trying to say and couldn&#39;t help but flush at the thought.

      When they went inside, Tycara was now awake, eating a snack. &quot;Hey, do you want to go 
to the waterfall tonight?&quot; Tsuru asked her.

      &quot;I would love to go!&quot;

      And when the sun set, they left the mansion. Isaka winked at Tsuru before she left, 
making the blue haired girl more anxious than before. The two of them had been raising 
Tycara together... with Tsuru fighting off the demon&#39;s advances every day. Luckily they&#39;d 
been so busy with Tycara that Tsuru didn&#39;t have to worry. She hadn&#39;t slept with the demon 
once, so that was good.

      Tsuru just wanted... she just wanted a normal relationship - not one based on physical 
comfort, but one... She looked over at the girl holding her hand, humming quietly. Tycara 
looked over at Tsuru.

      &quot;Huh? Is something on my face?&quot; Tsuru shook her head and they continued to walk.

      Maybe it was a bit weird to like a girl you&#39;ve raised like a little sister. But she 
couldn&#39;t help it - Tycara was sweet and kind and cute and just so... Tsuru wanted to take 
care of her. Maybe she was a little ahead of herself, but she could imagine living the rest 
of her life like this - just spending time with the girl she loved.

      Tycara was everything she wanted and... the girl liked her back, didn&#39;t she? Tsuru was 
sure they could build up a relationship - it would be slow though. And Tsuru was fine with 
that. Just the thought of being with her was alright. Her heart raced faster and they 
finally reached the waterfall. It was beautiful in the moonlight, making Tycara gasp.

      &quot;Oh, thank you for coming with me,&quot; Tycara said to Tsuru. &quot;It&#39;s so pretty!&quot;

      Tsuru nodded, blushing. And it wasn&#39;t the only thing that was pretty... The two of 
them sat down on the rocks nearby, watching the water fall to the river, foaming and 
swirling.

      &quot;Tycara... is there anything you want to do in life?&quot; Tsuru asked suddenly, only 
getting a confused look from the other girl. &quot;I mean, goals and stuff.&quot;

      &quot;Goals? Hmm, well... I guess I want to experience the world more and do things I 
didn&#39;t get to do before I died... and... and I want to help people who are different so they 
aren&#39;t treated badly like I was!&quot; Tsuru said with a smile, still thinking of things. &quot;I want 
to find someone too.&quot;

      &quot;Find someone?&quot;

      Tycara blushed. &quot;You know, find someone to be with, like in those books, the romance 
ones, Isaka has in the library.&quot; The girl gave Tsuru a goofy grin. &quot;She says they aren&#39;t 
hers, but I know she reads them a lot.&quot;

      Tsuru laughed. That would probably explain her silly seduction tactics. What a 
goofball. &quot;I want to find someone too... or well, I guess I already have...&quot;

      Tycara looked over at her. &quot;Really? That&#39;s good. It&#39;s always good to have someone.&quot;

      &quot;I know, I just... hmm, I&#39;m just taking my time. I&#39;m sure the right moment will pop 
up,&quot; Tsuru said, already trying to think of it. When would it be? When would she have the 
courage to tell Tycara how she felt?

      &quot;Well, they sure are a lucky person, Tsuru! She should feel great to have someone like 
you,&quot; Tycara said, still smiling.

      At that moment, Tsuru took a deep breath. Was this is it? She felt a strange build up 
in her chest, just thinking about it and if Tycara... did that mean Tycara liked her? Just a 
bit? Her hope began to build and she opened her mouth-

      Suddenly, Tycara flinched and looked up. &quot;Huh, I just felt a drop of water.&quot;

      Tsuru then felt a drop hit her and the two girls exchanged looks. &quot;I-I guess we should 
get back,&quot; Tsuru stuttered out, trying to swallow all her feelings. The moment... was gone. 
She let out a small sigh as they started to walk back. The rain began to fall more rapidly 
and soon they were jogging through the woods.

      &quot;Hey, Tycara, let&#39;s stay here for a while,&quot; Tsuru said, pulling the silver haired girl 
under the cover of some trees. There was no more water falling on them, but both girls were 
already soaked.

      Tsuru at least had a jacket, but since it had been a nice spring evening, Tycara was 
only in her dress. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s so cold!&quot; she said, grabbing Tsuru&#39;s arm and cuddling close.

      The blue haired girl felt that emotional build up again, but only pulled Tycara 
closer, trying to keep her warm. She was shivering in her arms...

      &quot;Haha, who would have thought it would rain so much?&quot; Tycara asked, looking up at 
Tsuru. Her heart froze in her chest as she looked down at that pretty face and into those 
innocent silver eyes.

      Tycara... was so pretty and even more so being slightly wet. Tsuru could feel her 
petite body flush up against her own. She loved Tycara... so much, just so much. Tsuru knew 
she couldn&#39;t help herself once one of her hands had risen by its own accord to cup the other 
girl&#39;s cheek. There was such a small space between them that it didn&#39;t take long for Tsuru 
to feel those soft lips.

      She shut her eyes and stopped a happy sound from creeping up her throat. For Tsuru, it 
was just right - the kiss was so chaste and innocent, just like Tycara. It was just how she 
wanted it, just how she dreamed of it. Tsuru briefly wondered if she should deepen the kiss 
or let it be or pull away, or... or...? God, she was nervous.

      She finally pulled away, her heart soaring. Tsuru had actually done it - she actually 
bore her feelings to Tycara. She looked expectantly at the younger girl, watching Tycara 
open her silver eyes... and Tsuru felt an odd pressure when she saw the confusion in those 
eyes.

      &quot;Tsuru... I,&quot; Tycara looked away and pursed her lips, trying to think of the words she 
wanted to say. &quot;I&#39;m not... like you and Isaka. I think that stuff is... hmm... icky...&quot;

      The silver haired girl trailed off as Tsuru felt that glimmer of hope die inside her 
chest. All those things she&#39;d thought of - taking care of Tycara and all the things they 
could do in a relationship - all those dreams were gone. It would... never happen now... How 
could it if the girl didn&#39;t even want to be with a girl?

      Why hadn&#39;t she even thought of that possibility? Tsuru just assumed that she would be 
that way because... well she was around them all the time and she thought Tycara liked her 
too and maybe, just maybe, she&#39;d found someone to love and be with and... and...!

      &quot;Oh,&quot; Tsuru choked out, unsure of what to say. &quot;I... didn&#39;t know that.&quot;

      Tycara looked down at the ground. &quot;I just don&#39;t like that kind of stuff.&quot;

      Her words were so innocent, so innocent that they hurt much more than a slap or even 
if Tycara were to cry or to yell at her. It hurt the most because that was what Tsuru loved 
about her... Such cruel, cruel innocence.

      &quot;Maybe we should head back,&quot; Tsuru whispered, looking away. The rain had slowed down, 
but the blue haired girl was happy that her tears blended in with the raindrops.
