We lost the tournament. Ivory gave me a special Valentine&#39;s as 
compensation. Kiki took me shopping. Mother and I spent time in the 
garden. I slept alone, but soundly. That is a graceful way of putting 
the week into perspective.

To lose the tournament was not a heavy blow to me, but not everybody 
else took it with such dignity. Kula threw fits, Yuki crumbled to the 
ground and wept, Corona and Rai expressed their distaste, and the new 
girl, Rozalia, was humbled. This was not to say that Stanton&#39;s team was 
utterly trounced&#151;we actually fared well, and finished in the top five 
overall in our district, which was impressive. I was content with the 
team&#39;s status, and congratulated them on what I felt was a victory. I 
had to explain that victory and winning were not always the same&#151;that 
winning could, in the long run, make things even worse for them all.

&quot;Annie&#39;s right!&quot; exclaimed Ivory, my girlfriend. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t mope 
around like this! We kicked plenty of ass to get where we are, and I&#39;m 
proud of everyone, especially the new girls! If I had more money with 
me, I&#39;d treat you all to a nice dinner!&quot;

&quot;Too bad we&#39;re all broke,&quot; muttered Zane. She had done well, although 
she had received her fair share of bruises and losing fights. Not one of 
us escaped from that tournament undefeated or unscathed, even those who 
I felt were our best. I myself did fairly well, and was beaten good and 
proper by a very worthy opponent whom I respected. Ivory took her own 
defeats as I thought she would&#151;sour at first&#151;but a simple smile from me 
turned her face bright. I wish I could properly express my love to her.

On the way home, I took her hand into mine and brought it close to my 
face. When she asked me what I was doing&#151;&quot;Just looking at you,&quot; I said, 
&quot;one bit at a time.&quot; I then kissed her hand, rough and calloused, 
touching her bruised palm with my lips, here and there. We had kissed 
each other&#39;s hands many times, and I knew this simple gesture would 
bring her little jolts of pleasure. The nerves on our fingers are 
sensitive, so what better place, save the lips, to kiss?

&quot;You are so wonderful,&quot; she sighed. I blushed humbly, and let her cup my 
cheeks. I eagerly accepted her lips and drew her close, Oh my sweet 
Ivory who has been so good to me. I was so glad...

&quot;Hey!&quot; she exclaimed, drawing away suddenly, &quot;let&#39;s go get something to 
eat!!&quot;

I had actually led an idyllic life for my first six years, but times 
changed for the worse, and things became hard on us. My father, a man I 
have not seen recently nor have any intention of seeing ever again, lost 
his job, and subsequently his mind as well. He spiraled into depression, 
which led to his abuse of us, wife and daughter alike. For ten years we 
both weathered his storms&#151;mom took a job just to avoid him, and I was 
encouraged to learn various degrees of martial arts so I could at least 
defend myself&#151;but finally we had enough. My uncle and aunt, good people 
I loved, forced my mother to move in with them, and had my father 
arrested on more counts of domestic violence than I could tally.

Our recovery was Herculean and tedious. I withdrew completely, becoming 
quiet, weak-willed, insecure, and depressed. I lost all my friends, 
except for a few in my karate classes, and was perceived as some Ice 
Queen, distant and cold as the deathly Pluto. I was misunderstood&#151;the 
karate queen that had no friends was surely up to no good, and would 
doubtless become a troublemaker. If only they knew the pain I had went 
through, the poverty and the loneliness, the isolation, the suffocation!

I can confidently say that Ivory Tran, in more than one way, saved my 
life, and for that alone I shall always love her.

&quot;I love you,&quot; I whispered as she bought my dinner. She turned red and 
smiled shyly, a sign that she still enjoyed hearing that.

&quot;I love you too, sweetheart.&quot; We kissed, and I couldn&#39;t help but weep. I 
took her in my arms and cried on her shoulder. Sometimes I&#39;m overwhelmed 
by the way life has treated me, from good to terrible and back again, 
and each day is an improvement over the last. Mother has a new love, one 
whom I adore, and of course there is Ivory, the beautiful wildflower, 
pushing and prying me out of my shell with unlimited patience and 
persistence. It took me by surprise to learn of her infatuation; my 
fragile heart yearned to be loved, even if it was by another girl, and 
so I extended it out for her to receive. Through many troubles, she has 
taken it and cared for it, treating it like a porcelain doll, so 
exquisite and tender.

She didn&#39;t know it yet, but when we took showers together after kendo 
class, I always snuck glances at her body. I loved the way she looked, 
whether naked or clothed, blonde or black-haired, grinning mischievously 
or smiling beatifically. I was attracted to her body and her smile, and 
that all-important aspect called soul&#151;and yes, one could say I even 
lusted for her, though certainly not in the same way she lusted after me 
(yes, I knew about that). I wanted to go further, but that was my 
untested emotions talking, not rationale. Rationale explained that I 
must take Ivory slowly, carefully, descending a little bit deeper every 
moment, until at last we arrived at the very center, unable and 
unwilling to go back.

I loved being with Ivory, of course, but I also loved spending time with 
my family. Lately these days, I have seen less of my aunt and uncle, 
perhaps due to my mother&#39;s deepening relationship with Kiki. I get the 
feeling that mom will eventually move out of that house, into her own 
place (or else Kiki&#39;s), and start her proper life. I&#39;m thinking that 
could happen once I graduate; they don&#39;t seem to be in any hurry in the 
meantime. I don&#39;t talk about these things to either of them when I spend 
time with them, just things here and there that seem to be of interest.

Like when Kiki takes me shopping, &quot;I think your mother might like this.&quot;

&quot;On you or her?&quot; She laughs.

&quot;Well, I guess there&#39;d be no harm in sharing.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s lingerie,&quot; I noted, chuckling. Her smile was so beautiful!

&quot;Well, when you&#39;re our age, more than a few crazy thoughts will pass 
through your head. Do you think I should get this?&quot;

&quot;Umm...well, she&#39;s really more into negligees. I think she&#39;d love a new 
straw hat.&quot;

&quot;And gardening tools too? March is just around the corner.&quot;

&quot;Not according to this weather,&quot; I noted. It was a cold February day, 
almost a week before Valentine&#39;s, which explained why we were out 
shopping. Kiki took me for several obvious reasons: she was not close to 
Ivory, she didn&#39;t want mom to know what we were getting her, she wanted 
my opinion, she wanted to spend time with me... I think she was still 
unsure of things, especially the way I felt about her, so I had to 
remind her how much I liked her, and how great she and mom looked 
together.

&quot;Really,&quot; I said, &quot;you two are awesome. I don&#39;t have any problems at 
all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for bugging you,&quot; she said. &quot;I just think it&#39;s rare for this 
kind of relationship to happen. A woman divorces her husband and takes 
care of her daughter, you don&#39;t expect her to jump into a homosexual 
relationship. It&#39;s even more unusual for the daughter to accept things 
and like them. You&#39;re a really fine young lady to do all that.&quot;

&quot;I just want my mom to be happy,&quot; I answered bashfully. She beamed at 
me, and resumed her shopping, eventually taking something I believed mom 
would like. She also wanted to get me something, and even though I said 
I didn&#39;t want anything, she insisted. I left her to shop in privacy for 
a bit while I scoped out something for Ivory. How does one present a 
Valentine&#39;s gift to a person that they love so deeply, one who has meant 
so much to them? I eventually settled on a silly book called 365 Ways to 
Kiss Your Love, knowing she would put it to good use.

I can&#39;t help but wonder whether my beauty was a curse or a blessing. 
Even strangers tell me how gorgeous I am, singing about my prime 
chocolate hair, my tall athletic frame, my frosty eyes and French-Korean 
features. Would Ivory have fallen in love with me if I were more plain? 
Would it be more difficult for people to spread rumors about me if I 
didn&#39;t look so haughty? I fought to compensate for this affliction, 
choosing humility over pride, consideration and helpfulness for 
selfishness, and grace instead of cruelty. Indeed I would say that the 
latter is my greatest strength, and will remain long after my body 
withers and becomes weak, for it is the heart and its deeds that live, 
and whoever remembers that is indeed wise.
