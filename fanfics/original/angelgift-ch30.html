<a href="../original/angelgift-ch29.html">Back to Part 29</a><pre>Queen Jen&#39;ai smiled from the bridge viewscreen, &quot;It&#39;s
good to have you home, daughter.&quot; The older woman
looked much like Jenna, only her face had a few more
lines and the long black hair was touched with threads
of silver. Dressed in an elegant gown she nearly
glittered sitting there in her chambers, her
expression oddly amused.

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Allison Tennison breathed out, her sandy
brown hair falling into her eyes. Her first instinct
was to stand and salute so she did, with crisp
military precision.

&quot;Captain,&quot; Queen Jen&#39;ai nodded, eyes twinkling with
amusement.

&quot;Mother,&quot; Jenna rose to take Allison&#39;s hand in hers as
she continued, &quot;I&#39;d like to present Allison, my
betrothed.&quot;

You could have heard a pin drop on the bridge as they
waited to hear the Queen&#39;s answer. After a moment she
smiled slightly, &quot;Then I look forward to knowing you
better, Allison. Could you and Jenna please come over
to the flagship?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Allison bowed slightly.

Another flash of a smile and the Queen disconnected,
the silence on the bridge breaking up into a burst of
whispered conversation as both Allison and Jenna sat
back down. Finally Sam C&#39;tarn cut through the sound
with a loud, &quot;Captain, do you want to shift-transit
over?&quot;

&quot;My mother may want some time to prepare,&quot; Jenna
murmured softly from where she sat there beside
Allison.

&quot;No,&quot; Allison said firmly, &quot;we&#39;ll take a shuttle
over.&quot; She smiled a little, &quot;Someone go wake up
Sharin, I want our best pilot on this.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m already awake,&quot; Sharin said irritably as she
emerged from the lift, the tall blonde dressed in her
crisply neat uniform, &quot;from that damn battlestations
alarm. So which shuttle do you want me to use?&quot; Beside
her Milly the catgirl looked around her curiously, her
maid&#39;s uniform hugging the redhead&#39;s body and her tail
lashing side to side.

&quot;Not the combat shuttle,&quot; Amara spoke up with a grin,
&quot;I don&#39;t know if the individual I got it from acquired
it fully legally.&quot;

Allison frowned at the black haired woman, &quot;Gee,
thanks for telling me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to go along as well,&quot; Milly spoke up, &quot;the
princess needs an attendant if this is to be a formal
meeting.&quot;

&quot;Hail Roma and Marilyn, let them know what&#39;s going
on,&quot; Allison said as she got up from the captain&#39;s
seat, offering Jenna a hand even as the lift opened up
again to reveal Commander Laurel D&#39;ken, the blue
haired woman clipping shut her uniform tunic as she
hurried on to the bridge.

&quot;Captain, I&#39;m sorry I....&quot; Laurel started.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Allison gave her a casual wave, &quot;you
mind taking command while I and Jenna are off the
ship?&quot;

&quot;Of course ma&#39;am,&quot; Laurel moved over to take the
captain&#39;s chair. &quot;Do you want us to stay at
battlestations?&quot; she asked.

Allison and Jenna headed for the lifts, Sharin and
Milly right beside them as Allison replied, &quot;Go to
yellow alert, just in case.&quot; At Laurel&#39;s questioning
glance she explained, &quot;You&#39;ve told me Home Fleet
doesn&#39;t usually leave Throne World, so I&#39;d rather
prepare for the worst.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Laurel nodded as the lift doors closed
on Allison.

&quot;Well thought out, love,&quot; Jenna squeezed Allison&#39;s
hand.

&quot;Home Fleet would never leave the Throne during
wartime,&quot; Milly softly fretted, nervously biting at a
fingernail.

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Sharin shook her head as she put a
reassuring hand on Milly&#39;s shoulder, &quot;the fleet will
move out if needed, but it&#39;s very rare. With all the
fleet bases and shipyards there the Throne is a
legitimate target, so protecting it is key.&quot;

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Allison asked Jenna as they
stopped, the lift doors opening up to reveal the large
shuttlebay.

&quot;I&#39;m trying not to guess,&quot; Jenna confessed, &quot;because
we really don&#39;t know enough about what&#39;s going on,
yet.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Allison conceded as they walked by a
row of combat shuttles to one that was being readied
by members of the crew. Normally a ship like Liberty&#39;s
Sword had extra crew to pilot the combat shuttles, as
well as marines for planetary operations, but with
them understaffed the vessels remained unused....

Midshipman Valentee Fai saluted as she said, &quot;Shuttle
prepped and ready to go, Captain.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Allison returned the salute gravely,
trying not to feel amused by the oddness of the
situation. This midshipman was probably better trained
than she was, but there wasn&#39;t much Allison could do
about it.

As the maintenance crew left the shuttlebay Sharin
grabbed the pilot&#39;s seat, Milly plopping herself in
the co-pilot&#39;s chair, even as Allison and Jenna took
the two seats behind them. At a touch to the controls
the shuttle smoothly rose as the protective force
screen over the bay doors disappeared, the air rushing
out of the chamber as they smoothly exited into the
void of space. &#147;Moving at half max. speed,&#148; Sharin
murmured as they moved across the distance to the
flagship.

&#148;So what can I expect?&#148; Allison asked softly.

Jenna took her lover&#39;s hand and squeezed gently, &#147;No
formal reception, thankfully. Mother usually doesn&#39;t
go for that kind of thing.&#148;

&#147;Good,&#148; Allison smiled, &#147;I&#39;m nervous enough as it is.&#148;

&#147;Join the club,&#148; Sharin muttered under her breath.

&#147;Eh?&#148; Milly blinked.

A grim smile tugged on Sharin&#39;s lips as she reminded
her, &#147;I am the Questor that was sent to retrieve
Jenna, I rather suspect the Queen is going to want to
know why it took me so long, at least.&#148;

&#147;You&#39;re toast, as the Earthers might say,&#148; Milly
smirked.

&#147;Thanks so much for all your sympathy,&#148; Sharin rolled
her eyes as the massive ship grew in their front view.

The flagship was a `Preserver&#39; class Star Destroyer,
the sort that was usually saved purely for Home Fleet
due to the massive cost of building the great ships.
Armed with all the latest in weapons and protective
shields they could absorb an incredible amount of
damage as well as strike out with devastating force.

&#147;We&#39;re being hailed,&#148; Milly noted, bringing to up on
the screen.

&#147;Liberty Sword shuttle, proceed to bay number two,&#148;
the blue haired young woman smiled slightly as she
continued, &#147;and welcome home, Princess.&#148;

&#147;It&#39;s good to be back,&#148; Jenna said to her cheerfully
before the other woman disconnected. Seeing Allison&#39;s
questioning look she quietly explained, &#147;When I was
younger I was so often aboard the flagship with my
mother that the crew almost adopted me. It&#39;s become
something of a tradition, it seems.&#148;

The docking bay they entered was larger by more than a
third than Liberty&#39;s Sword, loaded up with the latest
combat shuttles, fighters and other kinds of light
armored craft. &#147;Wow,&#148; Sharin purred at seeing the
lethal vessels, her eyes twinkling, &#147;I&#39;d give my right
arm to pilot one.&#148;

Milly shook her head, &quot;Bloodthirsty savage.&quot;

&quot;And proud of it,&quot; Sharin shrugged as they got up to
leave the shuttle.

Outside they were met by a lieutenant-commander who
promptly led them out of the bay to the lifts, staying
silent as they traveled. He dropped them off at a set
of main doors and smiled slightly, &quot;X&#39;tahn left word
you were to enter immediately.&quot;

Allison managed to keep her voice steady, &quot;Thank you.&quot;
Once he left she exchanged looks with everyone, then
said, &quot;Well, let&#39;s go.&quot;

The doors swung open smoothly to reveal an opulent
chamber, decorated in a style to suit royalty but none
of them noticed, focused instead on the regal woman
who gracefully rose from her throne. &quot;Mother,&quot; Jenna
smiled as she raced forward to be enfolded in a gentle
embrace.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; the white haired catgirl smiled at the
other three as they approached the throne, &quot;I am the
Queen&#39;s personal servant, X&#39;tahn.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an honor,&quot; Allison smiled, still watching mother
and daughter talking together quietly.

&quot;You are the one,&quot; X&#39;tahn murmured as she circled
Allison, &quot;I can sense Jenna&#39;s energies around her.&quot;
She frowned, &quot;But I never expected her to fall for
such a handsome man.&quot;

Both Sharin and Milly had to fight back their giggles
as Allison said with as much dignity as she could
muster, &quot;I&#39;m a woman.&quot;

&quot;Ah, oops?&quot; X&#39;tahn blushed.

Queen Jen&#39;ai finally looked over the three of them,
her gaze resting finally on Allison. &quot;Welcome,&quot; her
eyes twinkled in amusement, &quot;future daughter-in-law.&quot;

&quot;You accept my choice?&#39; Jenna breathed out.

&quot;I have heard a great deal about her from captains of
other vessels you&#39;ve encountered as well as the
sentinel station you saved,&quot; Jen&#39;ai said, &quot;they all
speak highly of you.&quot;

Allison cleared her throat, fighting back nervousness
as she pointed out, &quot;I also had a good crew helping
me.&quot;

&quot;Modest, too,&quot; Jen&#39;ai actually looked impish.</pre>
