<h1>Journey's End (part 12 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/journend-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>&quot;And on tonight&#39;s show we&#39;ll be talking with Nicole
Richards,&quot; the hostess smiled as she walked across the
view of the camera while still staying in front of the
studio audience, &quot;the recently publicly outed romance
author.&quot; She smiled, long black hair falling across
her shoulders as she said, &quot;Welcome... to Arts Scene.&quot;

Nicole took a deep breath as she sat by the host&#39;s big
desk, her red hair carefully styled and her clothes
crisp. This interview was part of Max&#39;s promotions
push, booked not long before her ex-girlfriend had
outed her and it was far too late to back out now.
Normally a local arts show like this wouldn&#39;t even
worry her, but this wasn&#39;t a normal situation.

&quot;Welcome, Ms. Richards,&quot; the hostess smiled warmly as
she settled catlike behind the desk while the viewers
at home all saw the opening credits run by, &quot;I wish
that we had met earlier today. I&#39;m Tiffany Edwards.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you, Miss Edwards,&quot; Nicole shook the
offered hand gently, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t able to get
to the studio early.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s quite all right,&quot; Tiffany smiled back before
adding, &quot;would it be unprofessional for me to say I
like your books?&quot;

Nicole smiled back, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t think so.&quot;

The producer&#39;s voice came on in the busy studio as he
coolly counted down, &quot;We&#39;re on in five... four.....
three... two...&quot;

On cue Tiffany smile turned professional, her eyes
still twinkling slightly as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sure many
of our viewers are aware of my first guest, the
popular romance author Nicole Richards. Beginning with
&#39;Quest for Love&#39; and leading up to &#39;Love&#39;s Trial&#39;
she&#39;s written over ten books, all featuring the
enchanting character Sharon Grey.&quot;

There was a dramatic pause as several of her covers
flashed by on the studio displays as well as tv
screens of home viewers. All tended to have a similar
theme, of course: the brown haired main character,
usually dressed in a low cut gown, and a handsome man
of various types and nationalities. &#39;Hokey,&#39; Nicole
thought, &#39;but they work.&#39;

&quot;The latest Sharon Grey novel is coming out in only a
few months,&quot; Tiffany chuckled, carefully pitching it
so viewers could hear as she continued, &quot;but speaking
of coming out, Nicole Richards has recently been
compelled to do so.&quot;

&#39;Who didn&#39;t see that joke coming?&#39; Nicole thought to
herself as she did her best not to roll her eyes at
that comment.

&quot;Ms. Richards,&quot; Tiffany looked over at Nicole, &quot;will
Sharon be coming out as a lesbian in the latest novel
in the series?&quot;

Nicole had to restrain her first impulse, to answer
yes knowing that her editor, not to mention the public
relations people, would have a fit. &quot;Sharon has been
straight throughout the series,&quot; she said evenly, &quot;I
doubt that&#39;ll change now.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Tiffany flashed an impish smile. She tilted
her head to the side, &quot;So what can you tell us about
the plot for the latest novel?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a secret,&quot; Nicole smiled back.

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Tiffany asked engagingly.

Nicole felt the gentle amusement of the crowd and felt
oddly comforted. &quot;I won&#39;t give away too many details,&quot;
she said, &quot;but after various trials Sharon decides to
return home, only to run into something unexpected.&quot;

&quot;Or someone?&quot; Tiffany asked teasingly, but Nicole kept
silent. Changing the subject she said, &quot;There&#39;s been
some trouble over your decision to conceal your
lesbianism, correct?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I concealed it,&quot; Nicole answered
mildly.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Tiffany raised a delicate eyebrow.

&quot;While I never stated my sexuality outright,&quot; Nicole
conceded the point, &quot;I was careful in my author&#39;s
biography not to claim to be straight. The only
mention of my relationships have been referring to my
partner, which is usually taken as code for a same-sex
companion.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a subtlety that may have escaped many of your
fans,&quot; Tiffany noted, &quot;considering some of the
articles I&#39;ve seen.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Nicole admitted, &quot;I know there is a bit
of controversy on-line. A few of the more conservative
book stores have stopped carrying my novels and I
understand that several religious organizations have
put me on their ban lists.&quot;

&quot;And how does that make you feel?&quot; Tiffany asked
gently.

&quot;Sorry for them,&quot; Nicole answered her promptly. She
flashed a smile towards the audience as she continued,
&quot;They&#39;re going to miss my new book!&quot;

There was quiet laughter from the audience, and even
Tiffany chuckled softly. The producer signaled her and
Tiffany said formally, &quot;Thank you for appearing today,
Nicole.&quot; Turning back to the audience she said
brightly, &quot;Stay tuned to our next segment, where we&#39;ll
be talking to a local filmmaker who&#39;s been challenging
taboos with his &#39;Blood, sex and magik&#39; series.&quot;

Nicole sighed in relief as she was gently ushered off
the stage by a assistant, a young man leading her
right towards the producer. &quot;Nicely done,&quot; Mr. Griffin
nodded crisply, &quot;wonder if you&#39;d like to appear
again?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Nicole blinked, mildly surprised.

Griffin smiled slightly, &quot;You had good chemistry with
Tiff and the audience, the bosses like that.&quot; He
paused, &quot;Not to mention that Tiff told me she likes
you. If we have another topic we can call you in on,
would you like to?&quot;

Nicole thought about it a moment then nodded, &quot;You
know, I&#39;d like that.&quot;

A few moment&#39;s later she was outside, Rachel waiting
patiently where she had illegally parked her car in
front of Virgin Megastore. &quot;Get in,&quot; the black haired
young woman waved wildly as she called, &quot;before I get
ticketed.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to come out and meet me,&quot; Nicole
smiled in honest pleasure as she climbed into the
passenger&#39;s side.

&quot;Not a problem,&quot; Rachel said to her teasingly, &quot;if I
wasn&#39;t here you could have been mobbed by your
fangirls.&quot;

&quot;Like that&#39;ll happen,&quot; Nicole shook her head.

Rachel actually laughed, &quot;Wanna bet? I&#39;ve already
stumbled across two on-line shrines to you.&quot; She
looked a bit sheepish as she continued, &quot;I never got
the chance to apologize for Lynn following me up to
Journey&#39;s End....&quot;

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Nicole flashed a smile at her
friend. They cruised up Robson street, passing the
posh stores and Starbucks, &quot;Instead of going back to
your apartment, do you think you could take me to the
airport?&quot;

Rachel chuckled softly, &quot;Eager to get back to your
ghostly girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Nicole answered Rachel honestly, her mouth
forming the words without her thinking about it, &quot;I&#39;m
in love.&quot;

Rachel chuckled as they drove, circling Denman Street
then going up Davie towards Granville. &quot;So you&#39;ve
finally admitted it,&quot; she said as they passed
apartments and quaint houses. A pause, &quot;Have you told
her yet?&quot;

&quot;And what makes you think I haven&#39;t?&quot; Nicole asked.

&quot;I know you,&quot; was Rachel&#39;s dry answer.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Nicole sighed. She looked out as they
rose Granville street past Granville Island, &quot;No, not
in so many words.&quot;

&quot;If you care for her as much as I think you do,&quot;
Rachel looked over to say to Nicole, &quot;then make sure
to tell her soon.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Nicole promised, her face going pale. She
jabbed Rachel firmly in the arm, &quot;Now keep an eye on
the road!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve driven in Vancouver for years,&quot; Rachel casually
weaved them through traffic, cutting off another car
to loud honks, &quot;we&#39;re fine.&quot;

&quot;Oh god,&quot; Nicole groaned, covering her face with her
hands.</pre>
