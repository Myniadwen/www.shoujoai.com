<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Jenn exited the washroom, relieved to find she had not started to bleed, 
yet. The tampon turned out to be easier to use then she thought, 
however, Jessica was probably right about this being one hell of a week. 
She stared down at the pills and decided to go down to the cafeteria for 
some water to help wash them down. She crept silently through the halls, 
down the back stairs, which lead directly into the cafeteria dinning 
hall and wove her way through the tables till she found a water cooler 
against one of the walls. She proceeded to pull a little paper cup off 
the side and filled it. Taking two pills from the bottle she popped them 
into her mouth and downed the entire cup. She made a face at the awful 
chalky taste of the pills while crumbling up the cup and dropped it in a 
nearby garbage pail then began to move towards the lobby when she 
noticed sounds coming from that room. She cautiously pushed through the 
double doors to find Natalie lying stretched out on one of the many 
couches, with the television on. 

&quot;Natalie, you&#39;re up too?&quot; Jenn remarked while approaching the couch to 
see that Much Music was playing Cory Heart&#39;s Sunglasses at Night video.

Natalie stretched and sat up straight, &quot;Yeah, I can&#39;t sleep. How about 
you? Your time?&quot; She asked nodding at the box in the girl&#39;s hands. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenn moved around the couch and sat at the opposite end, &quot;I 
forgot how much of a pain it is.&quot; She grumbled, placing the pills in the 
box and setting both on the coffee table, &quot;What about you? Why are you 
up so late?&quot;

&quot;Too much on my mind.&quot; Natalie admitted with a sigh, &quot;Say, how are your 
friends doing? The ones from Eastern?&quot; She inquired genuinely concerned. 

&quot;Oh Tanya and Cherilyn?&quot; Jenn said with a shrug, &quot;They are doing 
alright, I guess. The headmistress scolded Tanya a bit for entering the 
woods, but that was about all.&quot;

&quot;She got off lucky then&quot; Natalie remarked bluntly, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I 
should consider her lucky or stupid, sorry to say.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jenn agreed, remembering that day in the woods and a shudder ran 
across her spine.

&quot;Things sure have been busy this week.&quot; Natalie stated as she glanced 
out of the window, reminiscing about the passed events, &quot;Hard to believe 
that Halloween is almost here. After those woods I don&#39;t think there 
will be much that will scare me any more.&quot;

&quot;No kidding.&quot; Jenn remarked with a nervous laugh, &quot;By the way, you and 
Kima were amazing.&quot; She exclaimed excitedly, &quot;I don&#39;t think I told you 
that. I can&#39;t believe you two took on that man all on your own.&quot; 

Natalie&#39;s face grew long with despair, &quot;She is something else alright.&quot; 
There was a strain in her voice.

&quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; Jenn asked moving a little closer to the 
girl, &quot;You want to talk about it?&quot;

&quot;It... I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; Natalie stammered, she had been milling 
over her thoughts for hours before Jenn arrived and still could not sort 
things out for herself. 

&quot;Girl problems?&quot; Jenn probed already knowing the answer.

&quot;You could say that.&quot; Natalie replied with a sigh.

&quot;Seems to be going around.&quot; Jenn remarked dismally, turning to glance up 
at the ceiling, &quot;I always thought I&#39;d just have a problem finding one 
girl. This is beyond belief.&quot; She shook her head ever so slowly, &quot;Do 
straight people have this kind of trouble?&quot; 

&quot;Kim still giving you troubles?&quot; Natalie raised, a worried look upon her 
face. 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Jenn lightly closed her eyes and leaned her head on the 
back of the couch, &quot;My memories keep confusing me. I don&#39;t know what I 
feel anymore. I didn&#39;t even know I&#39;d kissed a girl until a couple of 
days ago.&quot; She rubbed her forehead in frustration, &quot;It is maddening. Why 
can&#39;t I remember anything clearly?&quot; 

&quot;At least your first kiss was worth remembering.&quot; Natalie muttered and 
curled her legs up under herself. 

Jenn rolled her head on the back of the couch to look at Natalie, &quot;What 
about that Alyson girl?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Natalie set her elbows on the arm of the couch and buried her face in 
them, &quot;I... I don&#39;t know... The one girl I want to kiss and I haven&#39;t 
got the courage to yet.&quot; The memory of Alyson discovering herself and 
Kima together entered her mind and she let out a depressed sigh. &quot;Now I 
think she hates me even more.&quot; She mumbled into the crook of her arm.

&quot;You lived with her for a while, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Jenn pried interested to 
learn more about her new housemates. 

&quot;Only for a few months.&quot; Natalie admitted, &quot;We curled up in the same 
bed, but nothing more. She never showed me much affection. The most she 
did was give me a necklace and it was only to protect me from evil.&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; Jenn stared back up at the ceiling, her eyes lightly closed, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

Natalie glazed over at Jenn, &quot;Tell me something?&quot; 

&quot;Hmmm?&quot; Jenn sleepily replied. 

&quot;Why did you call Kim&#39;s reflection Kima?&quot; Natalie questioned, wanting 
learn more about what Kim&#39;s past and friends. 

Jenn&#39;s eye fluttered open and she stared up at the ceiling. Thoughts 
rushing through her head, &quot;Why did I call her that?&quot; She muttered more 
to herself then anything else. 

&quot;I&#39;m starting to discover that I know very little about Kim or Kima.&quot; 
Natalie explained gloomily, &quot;I&#39;ve spend a year searching for the girl 
and I never knew the nightmares she lived with.&quot; She sat up, not letting 
her eyes off of Jenn, &quot;Never mind the fact that she had a girlfriend.&quot;	

Startled, Jenn sat up straight to face Natalie, &quot;We weren&#39;t... that 
is...&quot; She blushed deeply. 

Natalie eyed Jenn, watching the girl nervously play with the hem of her 
pyjama shirt, &quot;You don&#39;t have to tell me you if you don&#39;t want too, but 
don&#39;t tell me that you two did not have some kind of relationship 
going.&quot;

Jenn let out a deep sigh, she knew when she had been caught, &quot;We were 
young, maybe eleven or twelve.&quot; She finally admitted, &quot;I didn&#39;t remember 
it until we entered that forest. I guess that was when I gave her the 
nickname. I just remembered it when I say her reflection. I don&#39;t know 
why.&quot; 

Natalie patted the girl on the shoulder, &quot;It will all come to you when 
you are ready.&quot; She explained softly. 

All of a sudden the front doors to the dorm opened and a cool breeze 
rushed through the room. Natalie and Jenn turned around on the couch to 
see who could be visiting at such a late hour. There in the foyer stood 
a darkly clad person in a long cloak, the hood pulled far over its head 
so Jenn and Natalie were not able to see the person&#39;s face. 

Natalie was the first to spring to her feet, throwing daggers ready in 
hand behind her back, &quot;Who are you?&quot; She demanded of the shadowy figure, 
&quot;How did you get in here? The doors are locked after eleven.&quot; 

The figure turned its head to face Natalie, &quot;There is no need to be 
hostile.&quot; A bare arm emerged from under the folds of the cloak, an arm 
covered in dark flame tattoo that started from somewhere under the cloak 
and wrapped it&#39;s way up to the person&#39;s fingers. Carefully, as to not 
cause any more distress, the person pulled the hood off to reveal a 
young girl in her early teens, with ragged brown hair cut just below her 
ears, which encircled a small round face. The same flame tattoo circled 
the girl&#39;s right eye in blackness, making her one yellow eyes all the 
more vibrant, while a bright blue eye stared from her left eye. &quot;I&#39;m 
only looking for my sister.&quot; She stated with a light smile, &quot;Would one 
of you happen to know where I could find Aigneis?&quot;
