<h1>All Girls School (part 40 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch39.html">Back to Part 39</a><pre>Blake Baum grinned as she ran up to one of her two girlfriends, Usha 
Krishnan, who had watched the soccer team practice from the bleachers, 
as she had many times before. In years past, her observations had been 
secret, perhaps because she was unsure of herself when it came to 
adoration. She had known she liked Blake since almost the beginning, but 
thankfully she could now be more public about her support&#151;and her love. 
Blake was sweaty but she kissed her anyway.

&quot;You&#39;re going to knock them down in the homecoming meet,&quot; she said. 
Blake shrugged.

&quot;Well, me and the others. Zane and Katt are carrying this team; I&#39;m just 
working according to Leena&#39;s ideas.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so cute when you&#39;re humble.&quot; She grinned and scooted over so her 
girlfriend could sit next to her. They clasped hands and shared several 
kisses (Alexis Walker gave a rude wolf whistle before hiding away). 
Blake giggled once she was freed, and rubbed her nose against her 
girlfriend&#39;s. Of all the things circumstance had given her, to share the 
hearts of both Mira and Usha&#151;from out of nowhere! It had been her due, 
she reasoned: she had gone on long enough without romance. Usha returned 
the smile, but it was pale, far away, nestled in thought.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; asked Blake. Krishnan sighed and looked away.

&quot;It&#39;s Mira. We had another fight.&quot; Blake rolled her eyes glumly.

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Do you wanna be a poet and write

Do you wanna be an actor up in lights

Do you wanna be a soldier and fight for love

Do you wanna travel the world

Do you wanna be a diver for pearls

Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above

Be anyone you want to be

Bring to life your fantasies

But I want something in return

I want you to burn burn for me baby

Like a candle in my night

Oh burn

Burn for me

Burn for me

Are you gonna be a gambler and deal

Are you gonna be a doctor and heal

Or go to heaven and touch God&#39;s face

Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps

Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps

Or an angel

Under grace

I&#39;ll lay down on your bed of coals

Offer up my heart and soul

But in return

I want you to burn

Burn for me baby

Like a candle in my night

Oh burn burn for me burn for me

Yeah

Ooh

I want you to burn baby ooh

Laugh for me

Cry for me

Pray for me

Lie for me

Live for me

Die for me

I want you to burn

Burn for me baby

Like a candle in my night

Oh burn burn for me burn for me

Yeah

Ah yeah

I want you to burn

I want you to burn for me baby

Ohh yeah

&quot;The Election Results&quot;

&quot;What is with you two?&quot; she asked, making a wild gesture. Usha shrank 
into her own pity.

&quot;Blake, it was not my fault. We were merely having a private debate and 
she... oh! Sometimes that girl can be so stubborn, so impossible! I only 
presented what I believed to be a strong opinion, but she didn&#39;t have to 
get so upset over it!&quot;

&quot;You sound pretty upset yourself,&quot; murmured Blake. Usha gave her a look, 
but she held her ground. &quot;Look, I&#39;m just telling you the truth, sweets. 
You can get just as temperamental as Mira; you hardly ever back down 
from a debate. It&#39;s like a light goes on in your head, and you can&#39;t 
stop until the other party sees how wrong they were, or at least how 
misled.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not&#151;&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s exactly the problem,&quot; emphasized Blake, giving her girlfriend&#39;s 
hand a squeeze. &quot;It&#39;s been my unhappy observation these past few months. 
Now I realize the election is tomorrow, and we&#39;ll have a new junior 
class president in 24 hours, and you&#39;re supposed to be arguing. But 
sweetness, you can&#39;t have a good relationship with anybody if all you do 
is bicker over the silliest thing.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t&#151;&quot; Usha stopped herself as she realized she had been pouting, 
and took a cleansing breath. &quot;Forgive me,&quot; she muttered, and continued 
in her standard tone of civility. &quot;It was not a silly thing. Mira 
believed in it; that&#39;s why she argued for it. I did not see the 
importance, and I... well, yes, looking back on it, I&#39;m afraid I 
stressed my feelings far too tightly. I behaved very inappropriately, 
but the blame is not all mine.&quot;

&quot;Usha.&quot; Blake shook her head and touched her girlfriend&#39;s pale-brown 
skin, the glow of tough love in her blackish eyes. &quot;You love Mira. Don&#39;t 
put any blame on her if it&#39;s not due.&quot;

&quot;But it is&#151;&quot;

&quot;Usha.&quot;

&quot;Blake...&quot; The poor girl shook her head, unable to win and unwilling to 
admit defeat. She hung her head and sighed. Blake decided she needed 
some love, and went in to kiss her cheek.

&quot;Maybe you better tell me what got you two so riled up. Then I&#39;ll 
understand as well.&quot; Usha smiled warmly.

&quot;A fine idea. I keep telling you, Blake, you should be in the senate or 
congress.&quot;

&quot;Nah, it&#39;s not my style. I&#39;d get impeached after a week due to not being 
able to focus. And speaking of which, before my train of thought 
derails, the situation?&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

......

&quot;So tell me again about this new campaign promise of yours. I hear 
you&#39;re telling people you&#39;ll open up a new club if you&#39;re elected.&quot;

&quot;I hope so.&quot; Mira fiddled with her lunch and Usha&#39;s hand at the same 
time, liking one considerably more than the other. The rib meat, if it 
could be called that, tasted more like somebody had poured watered-down 
expired barbecue sauce on a sheet of beef-flavored cardboard. There were 
more nutrients in Mira&#39;s sneakers than in the meal; she stuck to the 
corn and the brownie, and turned her nose against the inferior beef. Not 
even if she were starving...

&quot;Go ahead, don&#39;t be so picky,&quot; Usha prodded, noticing her girlfriend&#39;s 
reactions. &quot;It&#39;s not like it&#39;s deadly.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s insulting. Pity, though; a good waste of money too. You want?&quot;

&quot;Uh, I&#39;m trying to avoid meat altogether.&quot;

&quot;Bah! I have a Vegan girlfriend!&quot; Mira coughed and shoved her lunch tray 
away. Usha gave her a sad smile and kissed her cheek.

&quot;I&#39;m not that bad, am I?&quot;

&quot;Joking.&quot; Mira&#39;s soft smile convinced her, and with an ahem, she vouched 
for her idea. &quot;I want to start a club centered around love for Japanese 
animation. I could include many people, myself being president, and I 
can have meetings whenever it is convenient. I don&#39;t think I am... 
abusing? Is that the right word? Oh&#151;abusing my power. It&#39;s very small.&quot; 
Usha mulled over it for a second.

&quot;Japanese animation... That&#39;s the, uh, ominay you like, right?&quot;

&quot;It is anime,&quot; Mira corrected coolly, &quot;and yes it is. I&#39;ve already 
started a petition and had many people sign it. Miss Marbel will have to 
recognize it once I&#39;m president.&quot; Usha gave an unreadable look. Mira 
knew for a fact that she was not the only one who wanted an anime club; 
many, many women at the school, student and faculty alike (Ms. Keeping, 
for example), had wanted an official place to discuss, view, and immerse 
themselves in their love. Usha had been largely unaware of this ideal, 
since she ran with the people who saw themselves as &quot;above&quot; childish 
things like that.

&quot;Mira, one way or the other, I hope your dream comes true. But if I&#39;m 
elected, I can&#39;t promise condoning that. It&#39;s just not something that 
interests me. I&#39;m more likely to focus on the Homecoming Festival, the 
Winter Social, Prom, and things like that. If you want to start a club, 
keep that petition and speak with the Headmistress. I&#39;m sorry; I can&#39;t 
bother myself with something like that. No offense.

&quot;But it does offend me!&quot; argued van Dijk, looking hurt. &quot;Yusha, you are 
my girlfriend and I love you, and I had hoped we could share many 
interests together. We already do, but I&#39;d like to show you more. Don&#39;t 
you think you could at least give it some thought?&quot;

&quot;But that is not one of my promises.&quot; Usha gave her a gentle stare and 
took her hand. The softness of those fingers was euphoric.

&quot;It could be.&quot;

&quot;Ah. But it&#39;s so late. Tomorrow is the election; you&#39;ve got your 
promises and speeches, and I have mine. I cannot change my mind so late. 
Mira, honestly, if you win, all the better for your cause, and if you 
don&#39;t, you can still try and&#151;&quot;

&quot;Usha, please, for me.&quot; She squeezed her hand, her eyes begging. 
Krishnan shook her head.

&quot;I can commit to very few actions I did not promise to embark upon. I 
could grant you the power to start one, if necessary, but I won&#39;t be the 
one to do it myself.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess I&#39;ll have to win.&quot; Mira gave her a nasty look, snorted, 
and got up from the table. Feeling insulted, Usha dashed after her, 
making a scene in front of the entire cafeteria.

&quot;Don&#39;t be so certain of yourself, Mira! I respected you greatly because, 
let&#39;s face it, you&#39;re an amateur doing the job of a professional! If you 
did win, how long do you seriously think you can hold office? Huh? How 
long before you&#39;re overwhelmed?&quot; Mira whirled around, now visibly angry, 
her face vivid.

&quot;You think I am stupid, don&#39;t you? That I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m doing! You 
may as well say it; you&#39;ve never taken me seriously since I began this!&quot;

&quot;I have so! I liked you and respected you because&#151;&quot;

&quot;Because silly girl who never had any experience now shows that she 
knows a few things, right? Am I right?&quot; Usha froze, half sad and half 
furious. She put her hands on her hips and rubbed her eyes.

&quot;Mira, no&#151;no. I liked you because you gave me a challenge; you made me 
go outside my own expertise and work harder. None of my previous rivals 
have ever done that before, and... why are you getting so worked up 
about this?&quot; Mira practically spat at Usha as she answered.

&quot;Because maybe you need to get your stupid butt off your throne and let 
somebody new take over.&quot; She stormed away furiously, pushing a few 
people aside and nearly getting detention from several irate teachers. 
Usha growled and whispered a very quiet curse, and excused herself in 
front of those who had observed. She took a deep breath, returned to her 
table, and disposed of her tray. Out of kindness, she took Mira&#39;s, and 
left the lunchroom in a hurry.

......

&quot;Jeez,&quot; sighed Blake, &quot;you can be a real bitch sometimes.&quot; Usha&#39;s calm 
face exploded in shock.

&quot;Excuse me!!!&quot;

&quot;Honey, it&#39;s true, okay? Look, I still don&#39;t know you very well, but I 
already know you have a hard time hearing the truth, at least when it&#39;s 
offensive.&quot;

&quot;How dare you&#151;&quot;

&quot;Listen!!&quot; Blake snorted, calmed down, and apologized. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m 
sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to snap at you. But you can really be testy at 
times, Ush. You hardly ever listen to people&#39;s opinions if they oppose 
yours, and if something offends you, especially if it&#39;s true, you go 
crazy. Maybe Mira&#39;s right&#151;maybe you should be replaced for awhile, 
because honestly, you don&#39;t strike me as the kind of politician you 
should be.&quot;

Usha growled at her, squeezing her brows tight, but Blake had said 
everything with honesty and love; she cared for Usha very deeply, and 
Mira, and she knew they could be better. Usha slowly, reluctantly 
accepted her girlfriend&#39;s words, sagged, calmed, and fell into Blake&#39;s 
arms, moaning in shame. She had been terrible, and one-sided, and 
stupid, and stubborn, and everything else. She had been a horrible 
hypocrite, and begged for forgiveness. Blake hugged her and kissed her 
forehead.

&quot;Look, honey, I love you and I forgive you, but you need to apologize to 
Mira too. And you need to forgive her. Please, god Usha, don&#39;t make this 
a big deal. Does it really matter to you who gets elected? Does it 
really matter to Mira who starts her club, and when? Does it? Is all 
this nonsense worth fighting each other, when you know you love each 
other?&quot; Usha sniffled, wiping her tears away as she smiled sadly and 
shook her head.

&quot;No... it&#39;s not.&quot;

&quot;Then will you apologize to Mira, please, and forgive her? And do it in 
person, not over the phone?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I will.&quot;

&quot;Will you kiss and make up?&quot; Usha gave a crooked laugh.

&quot;Yes, I certainly will. Oh, Blake, you&#39;re so wonderful... so very 
wonderful...&quot;

&quot;Bah.&quot; She returned Usha&#39;s embrace humbly, absorbing the tears and 
compliments. Usha kissed her below the ear, on the cheek, across the jaw 
and up to the mouth, where she stayed a very long time, expressing 
passion and relief and love in the warm embrace. Blake felt herself 
soaring as her hands held her girlfriend&#39;s shoulder blades, traveled to 
the small of her back, combed her long hair, caressed her face. The two 
grinned and shared several tender kisses, and rubbed noses softly.

&quot;Sometimes I miss you,&quot; whispered Usha.

&quot;How so? You see me every day.&quot;

&quot;I mean... I miss this. I&#39;ve been working so hard, I&#39;ve not had time to 
be intimate with you... or with Mira. I think that&#39;s the problem. I&#39;m 
not proving to her how deeply I cherish her. I think I&#39;m getting a 
little scared.&quot;

&quot;That you&#39;ll lose her? Nonsense, Usha. Mira loves you; she tells me all 
the time. I should be the one to be worried; I&#39;ve seen you two together. 
I&#39;m surprised you haven&#39;t left me and gone off with each other!&quot;

&quot;I would never&#151;we would never do that!&quot; she insisted. Usha took her 
girlfriend&#39;s hands and kissed them, fingers and knuckles and wrist, and 
kissed her salty palms slowly, delicately, making sure Blake could feel 
every part of her mouth. She inhaled sharply and gave a sigh of love.

&quot;What would we ever do without you, beautiful Blakie?&quot; whispered 
Krishnan, placing her girlfriend&#39;s hand on her cheek. &quot;You&#39;re our glue, 
lovely. You keep us all together. Mira and I would be terrible to each 
other&#151;or... maybe... I&#39;d just be terrible to her, if it weren&#39;t for you. 
I know I definitely need you in my life, Blake, to keep my head from 
getting too big. And Mira needs you too, sweetness; I&#39;ve seen how much 
happier she gets with you around. You look so darling together...&quot;

&quot;And you and I look pretty hot ourselves,&quot; she admitted slyly. Usha 
giggled, gave Blake a fierce hug, and an even fiercer smooch. Baum 
laughed and held her girlfriend by the waist, grinning for love and 
sighing happily. &quot;Eh... sorry. I worry over nothing. Tell you what&#151;you 
apologize to Mira, make out for awhile, and all three of us will go out 
on a really romantic date. How&#39;s about that? And who cares who wins, 
we&#39;ll all still love each other.&quot; Usha smiled warmly, kissed her deeply, 
and nuzzled her neck.

&quot;As always, your wisdom exceeds my own. Hence why I need you. All right, 
I&#39;ll do it. Before we go, um... do you think the two of us could spend a 
little more time together, in private?&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot; Usha gave a glowing smile.

&quot;And can we take a shower together, since you&#39;re so smelly?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no thanks. Just follow me into the locker room and no peeking.&quot;

&quot;Aww, why not?&quot; Usha smiled playfully and drummed her fingers on her 
girlfriend&#39;s arm, but Blake wasn&#39;t as spunky.

&quot;Eh, I don&#39;t like my body. It&#39;s really not very great. Please don&#39;t 
look; I&#39;m very self-conscious.&quot;

&quot;Oh... but I think you are very beautiful. And... sexy.&quot; Usha grinned 
and blushed; Blake just blushed. She whistled and wiggled out of her 
girlfriend&#39;s grip.

&quot;Uh, yeah. Anyway, don&#39;t peek. And don&#39;t join me in the shower. When I&#39;m 
ready for it, I want you and Mira with me, all three of us together.&quot;

&quot;As you wish.&quot; Krishnan smiled and locked hands with Blake, and followed 
her into the locker room, where they parted briefly so Baum could 
undress, shower, and change into a fresh pair of clothes. They discussed 
the date in the meantime, and how well Mira and Usha could 
&quot;congratulate&quot; each other once one of them won the election.

.........

Jocelyn made her way through the bleachers, sidling past legs and 
bodies, as she and Erica looked for a seat. The auditorium was already 
crowded, but they had asked for it after stopping several times for 
personal conversation. Eventually they sat, Jocelyn feeling what she 
believed to be very early signs of her pregnancy, though it was really 
just the ice cream settling. Erica wedged herself in a little more, gave 
a meek smile, and pulled her friend in and combed her dark brown hair, 
playing with the curls at the end.

First-year, sophomore, junior, and senior class presidents would be 
announced soon, and the wait and anticipation (or lack thereof with the 
indifferent students) would finally be over. Some people there actually 
cared who was going to run their class, but even those who did not were 
interested to see where the Mira v. Usha campaign would go. Headmistress 
Marbel came into sight a few minutes later, not settling very many 
people with her presence. She held a hand up and got the silence she 
wanted, though still not from everyone.

&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; she began, &quot;and thank you all for coming. I will keep 
this short, since no doubt you look forward to returning to class.&quot; 
Naturally, people both laughed and groaned at this. She grinned, fully 
self-aware, and called out, &quot;So without further ado, let me first call 
out the candidates from each of the classes.&quot; Eight girls came out, most 
of whom were familiar with the audience before them, though some were 
strangers who had came from nowhere and were now making a good 
impression.

&quot;First, the fresher class: in a slightly skewed vote, we have... Sheila 
Creed winning over Kera Knight!&quot; The audience applauded, some more 
polite than enthusiastic. Kera congratulated Sheila, and sat down, very 
dignified. &quot;For the sophomores, a rather one-sided victory: Rita 
Holloway wins decisively over Mina Sharve!&quot; Again, applause. Some people 
obviously liked Holloway; poor Sharve had barely gotten 15 of the vote. 
The Headmistress gave an anxious smile as she flipped the pages around, 
getting to the &quot;main event&quot;; that is, who would take the junior class 
crown.

&quot;And now the junior class,&quot; she said with obvious flair. &quot;In what has 
been the closest election race in Stanton&#39;s history, and perhaps the 
most unlikely, I am pleased to announce that in the race between Usha 
Krishnan and Mira van Dijk, the winner... achieving presidency by only 
one percent of the vote...&quot;

&quot;Get to it already!&quot; shouted someone. Marbel gave the girl a catty 
smirk.

&quot;All right, all right. The winner, by a fraction... Usha Krishnan!&quot;

The crowd either cheered or jeered, depending on who they liked, and 
there was hardly a stunned face in the crowd. Some people swore that the 
underdog Mira would upset Usha and gain the title, while others were 
stunned that Krishnan kept her streak. Either way, the reaction was 
something to remember. Both Mira and Usha looked surprised, and while 
Mira did seem upset for a little while, she got over her pride, clapped, 
and walked over to shake Usha&#39;s hand. Usha would give her speech later.

&quot;Well,&quot; said Marbel once things settled, &quot;that&#39;s a tough act to follow, 
but since brevity is the soul of wit, I&#39;ll be brief and say for the 
senior class, Tabitha Jamison has narrowly won against Janice Isner.&quot; 
The crowd applauded weakly, and calmed for the speeches of their new 
presidents. Sheila, Rita, and Tabitha delivered forgettable Thank-You 
and I&#39;ll-Do-My-Best monologues, but it was Usha&#39;s that stood out. She 
came to the podium, cleared her throat, and chuckled.

&quot;Wow. I honestly thought Mira would win. Lord knows she deserves it.&quot;

&quot;Abdicate!&quot; screamed a girl. Usha laughed merrily.

&quot;Oh, I would, but I was chosen to this task, though I must profess, I 
think it&#39;s because I have a record for reliable service. If I had came 
into this fresh as my friend and rival Mira had, there is no doubt in my 
mind that she would have beaten me soundly. Headmistress Marbel, might I 
ask an unusual and unprecedented favor of you?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;May I please, if it&#39;s possible at all, allow Mira to be my 
vice-president? She is very capable,&quot; she continued through murmurs of 
disbelief, &quot;and I must say that since the race was so close, having 
someone like her working alongside me would improve the school and the 
junior class. She is a very dear friend of mine, and with one other 
exception, I would have nobody else beside me. The honor is hers anyway, 
but since I was chosen, I would like her to have this rank.&quot; Mira was 
aghast and stunned, and couldn&#39;t speak even to mutter in her own 
language. Headmistress Marbel was touched and surprised as well, and 
after considering it (weathering chants of &quot;Do it!&quot;, &quot;Let her!&quot;, and &quot;We 
want Mira!&quot;), she nodded her head.

&quot;Since you didn&#39;t nominate a vice-president in the first place&#151;perhaps 
the two of you conspired to fill in the gap should either of you win?&#151;I 
really don&#39;t see the harm in it. It is unprecedented,&quot; she continued 
through the cheers and applause, &quot;but some precedents were made to be 
broken. As Headmistress of Elizabeth Cady Stanton Public High School for 
Girls, it is my honor to dub you President, Usha Krishnan, and upon your 
request, Mira van Dijk as Vice-President.&quot;

Mira squealed and bounced as she was called over, and could barely 
restrain herself as Marbel gave her the titles, responsibilities, and 
powers of her position. Once they were both official, she gave Usha a 
tight bear hug and twirled her around in the air, and in front of the 
entire assembly of students, teachers, and friends, Mira kissed Usha 
right on the mouth.

Jocelyn Elizabeth McKeough said, &quot;Oh my.&quot;

Blake Freda Baum blushed as Gabrielle jabbed her in the ribs.

Ana Lu sneezed.

&quot;Take care,&quot; said Rai.</pre>
