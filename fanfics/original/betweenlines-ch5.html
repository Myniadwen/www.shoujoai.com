<a href="../original/betweenlines-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The night passed by quickly in my stirfilled sleep. I awake to a dim 
Sunday morning sky. The breeze is cool, I can tell by my opened window. 
My clock reads 9:31. With a sigh, I take a seat on my bed, head in 
hands.

I try to sort out everything that had happened. About the party, my 
blackout, and Karen. Speaking of which, I dont know when she&#39;s gonna be 
here. Might as well get ready and just wait.

I make a quick change from yesterday&#39;s clothing into a pair of jeans and 
a T-shirt. I leave my bedroom and quickly make my way down stairs. 
Grandpa was probably at church, as he was every Sunday morning, and Dad 
was probably at the diner, his usual routine. I take a quick look about 
the house, no one was home, then take a seat at the kitchen table.

&quot;How did this happen...?&quot; I think aloud. I dont even remember taking a 
drink, or talking to anyone but my friends. I sigh and lay my head on 
the table. The knock on the door rouses me from my depressed heap.

I briskly jog to the front door, which I open to see the familiar pretty 
face of Karen Tanimoto. &quot;Gi&#39; Morning.&quot; she says cheerfully, her charming 
smile on her tan face.

&quot;What&#39;s so &#39;gi&#39; about it?&quot; I say downly as I grab the keys to the house 
and step out the door, &quot;Let&#39;s go. Grandpa wont be back until after 
Noon.&quot;

Karen nods and leads me to her car. She is nice enough to open the 
passenger door for me and I slide into the seat. Karen takes the seat in 
the driver&#39;s seat and the car quickly pulls out of my drive. &quot;I was able 
to schedule an appointment last night. Dr. Tann.&quot;

&quot;Thanks&quot; I say offhandedly, staring doreward down the road.

Karen glances at me, her brown eyes skimming over my face comfortingly. 
Her face returns to the road and her right arm reaches over to pat my 
shoulder, &quot;You&#39;ll be fine, Alexia.&quot;

I take no comfort in her statment, nor do I respond. The car ride to the 
doctor&#39;s officer was silent and my comrade slides into a open parking 
space. The two of us exit the automobile and Karen, with her arm around 
my shoulders, takes me into the building. We walk up to the counter and 
Karen speaks with the receptionist. After a few paper signings, the 
woman at the counter says that the doctor will se me and I&#39;m lead to the 
back.

The receptionist takes me to a empty room where she leaves me to wait 
for the doctor to come and see me. The wait in the empty room seemed 
like hours and the smooth jazz that came through the speakers got quite 
annoying. Finally, Dr. Tann entered the room.

His smile was warm as he looked at me, &quot;Good morning, Miss...&quot; he 
glanced at his papers, &quot;Laugh-a-yeet?&quot;

&quot;LaFayette.&quot; I correct him and he nods with a apology.

The seemingly foreign doctor sets his papers aside and looks at me, &quot;So, 
you&#39;re friend told me about why you&#39;re here and I&#39;m very glad you came. 
Most teens your age dont come to a doctor. Things that could have been 
prevented go bad.&quot; He shakes his head then looks back into my eyes, &quot;If 
you&#39;ll change into this gown, we&#39;ll get down to business.&quot;

The tests take at least an hour, including the waiting for the results 
and I sit in the testing room, starring at the pale yellow walls 
blankly. The wait lasted for what seemed like decades. After a while, 
the doctor enters the room.

His eyes skim over me blankly. He appears completely emotionless and I 
stare at him the same way, awaiting the results of the tests. Dr. Tann 
takes a seat across from me and holds the papers in front of him. I 
catch a glance of his lips curling under his beard as he reads the 
papers, &quot;In the case of Alexia LaFayette, you proved negative for any 
case of Sexually Transmitted Diseases.&quot;

After he reads the results of my STD tests, I simply stare at him for a 
moment. My mind sorts out the information that I&#39;d just recieved and 
finally sends the right signals to my body. A smile comes over my face 
and I stand looking at the doctor, &quot;I&#39;m okay?&quot; I ask exubrantly and the 
man nods his head, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Is all I can say as I head for the door 
to tell my waiting friend.

I come upon the door to the waiting room and see Karen sitting in the 
empty room, bent over a magazine. The open the door and her head shoots 
up, looking at me. A smile comes across my face as I walk towards her, 
&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; I say as she stands to welcome me, &quot;I&#39;m alright. The tests 
came back and I&#39;m okay.&quot;

Karen shares my joy and walks towards me. Before I can do anything, I&#39;m 
wrapped in her arms, in a tight embrace. &quot;I told you.&quot; She says as she 
hugs me tightly. Karen seems to sense my discomfort and lets me out of 
the hug as we both notice Dr. Tann coming over to see us.

He smiles at us as he walks over, &quot;I guess you&#39;ve heard the good news?&quot; 
He says while cleaning his glasses, &quot;You&#39;re girlfriend is going to be 
just fine. As for the topic of pregnancy, all I want her to do is watch 
for any symptoms. If anything comes up then I want you to come right 
over here and see me.&quot; He turs to leave but before he does, he adds a 
quick statement, &quot;I dont think she&#39;ll have to come to me again.&quot; With 
that, the doctor walks off.

Karen turns back to me with a wide smile, &quot;Hear that?&quot;

I nod exuberantly, &quot;Sure did!&quot;

&quot;Yep.&quot; Her arm wraps around my shoulder again and she walks me out 
towards the car, &quot;Also, it appears as though we&#39;re dating.&quot; she laughs 
as we come upon her car and we slide back into our past positions.

&quot;He said &#39;girlfriend,&#39; didnt he?&quot; Karen nods and I chuckle but the 
familiar blush comes over my cheeks. The car starts up and we pull out 
onto the street.

&quot;We got time before you&#39;re gramps gets back.&quot; Karen motions toward the 
clock: 10:44, &quot;How about we stop for a bite to eat. My treat.&quot;

I take the chance to fill my empty stomach and Karen takes us to her 
favorite fast food place. She orders for the both of us and she pulls 
into a empty parking spot a distance from the other cars. My oriental 
friend hands me my food, a cheesburger and fries, and says, &quot;Dig in.&quot;

Karen immediatly starts on her burger but I hold back some. A thought 
had been on my mind since leaving the doctor&#39;s office and I didnt want 
to ponder it any longer, &quot;Karen?&quot; I succeed in getting her attention, 
&quot;Why... Why did you do this?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; She asks as she lays down her cheesburger, looking at me.

&quot;Why&#39;d you take me to the doctor? Why have you helped me so much?&quot;

Karen looks away and shakes her head, &quot;I dont know.&quot; she says quickly, 
&quot;It just felt like the right thing to do.&quot;

I nod slowly and look back at my food, &quot;Alright...&quot; I say and take a fry 
and quickly put it in my mouth.

For awhile, the car is silent. Karen appears thoughtful and barely 
finishes her meal. After a few moments she turns to me again, &quot;Alexia, 
you want to know why I did all this for you?&quot; I bite my lower lip and 
look at her with a slow nod, &quot;I... I did this because...&quot; She sighs, 
&quot;Ever since I met you in the grocery store, I&#39;ve been thinking about 
you. I dont know why but I have. Then I saw you in that car crash and I 
carried you out. I think I fell in love with you right there. You&#39;re 
just so... cute and I love the way you carry yourself. I know it&#39;s wierd 
but... that&#39;s how I feel.&quot;

I look out the window after Karen&#39;s statement is through. The whole 
thing caught me completly by suprise. I&#39;d been thinking about Karen in 
the same way. When I first saw her, I was... attracted to her. She&#39;s 
beautiful and the more I talk to her the more I love her personality. 
All my emotions are so confusing. I&#39;d never thought I could feel this 
way about another female but... I sigh and look back at Karen. &quot;Karen. 
I-I know how you feel. I think I feel just like you do.&quot; I cant think of 
anything else to say but the words are useless as Karen leans over to me 
and, before I can do anything, our lips are locked in a kiss. I stare at 
her in disbeleif then slowly fall into the sign of emotion.

Karen pulls away after a few seconds of the kiss and stares at me. Her 
gaze digs to my bone and I cant help but smile. Her eyes seem to flutter 
as the same smile crosses her face, &quot;You feel the same?&quot; She asked me, 
as if in disbeleif. I slowly nod, my hair annoyingly falling into my 
face and I push it away. Karen smirks and laughs, &quot;You&#39;re so cute.&quot; She 
says as she kisses me gently once more, &quot;I didnt even know you were... 
into girls.&quot;

&quot;Me niether.&quot; I say gently and look foreward, &quot;but I&#39;m glad I am.&quot; I 
lean back in my seat and stretch, &quot;It&#39;s strange, really. I hardly know 
you...&quot;

&quot;Well, now we have time to get to know eachother.&quot; Karen was starting 
the car. The automobile pulled out of the parking spot and slowly drove 
down the road. Before I could even ask where we were going, she pulled 
into the local park and was stepping out of the car. I followed, &quot;Come 
on.&quot; She urged as she led me to a empty park bench. Karen took a seat 
and patted the spot next to her.

I sit hesitantly, &quot;What are we doing, Karen?&quot; I ask, staring at her 
akwardly.

&quot;Getting to know eachother.&quot; She said offhandedly, &quot;I&#39;m Karen Taka 
Tanimoto.&quot; She said with a slight laugh.

I smile at her strangly. Karen was proving to be... quite the strange 
woman. After a few seconds, Karen nods to me as if telling me to do the 
same, &quot;I&#39;m Alexa Jewel LaFayette.&quot; I smile to her.

&quot;I&#39;m twenty-one years old and work at Steven&#39;s Wine and Dine.&quot;

I give the same information, &quot;I&#39;m seventeen years old and go to Escort 
High School, I&#39;m a Senior. Where&#39;d you go to school, Kar?&quot;

Karen shakes her head, &quot;Escort.&quot; She shrugs, acting slightly strange.

&quot;Really? I&#39;ve never seen your picture on the graduation wall...&quot;

&quot;What makes you think I graduated...&quot; Karen&#39;s smile disappears and she 
looks at the ground shyly.

I look at her, &quot;Oh... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; I look at her sympathetically. I&#39;d 
never thought that Karen was a drop out.

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; She looks back at me and stands, &quot;I get along. Now tell me, 
little girl, is there anything interesting I should know about you 
before we officially start dating.&quot;

I blush at the statment. &#39;dating.&#39; I hadnt been &#39;dating&#39; since Joey and 
I&#39;d never dated a girl. I swallow quietly, &quot;Not that I know of.&quot; I say 
and smile up at the woman.

Gently, Karen takes me by the hand and stands me up with her, &quot;Good, 
then we can get started.&quot; She laughs and smiles, a white toothy smile. A 
stand up on my toes and kiss her, my first act of love to this girl, &quot;I 
can get used to this.&quot; She says with a wry smirk, &quot;I suppose I should 
take you home now.&quot;

I take Karen&#39;s hand and look at her watch and swallow once more, &quot;Yeah, 
you&#39;d better. Gramps&#39;ll be home any minute and I dont want him asking me 
where I was.&quot;

Karen nods understanding and walks me back to her car. The car starts 
without trouble and she slowly starts making her way back to my house, 
&quot;You know, we can always just say you hung out with your friends.&quot; She 
says and glances at me.

I shake my head, &quot;No.&quot; I smile, &quot;I&#39;m kind of grounded.&quot; A light blush 
comes over my cheeks at home childish I sound.

Karen obviously thinks so too and begins to laugh, &quot;Aw, were you being 
naughty, little girl.&quot; I pout and say nothing, Karen chuckles, &quot;Just 
kidding. No need to get that look on your face. Heh, I&#39;ve only known 
your for a few days and I can already read your face. You&#39;re very easy 
to ready, Alexa.&quot;

I scratch my head, thinking about the comment as we pull into the 
driveway of my house. I step out of the car and Karen smiles at me, &quot;How 
about I pick you up after school tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;What about my car?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll bring you to school too.&quot;

A smile comes across my lips and I nod, &quot;Alright. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow 
then.&quot;

&quot;You bet. See-ya, Alexa.&quot;

I wave to my new girlfriend as she pulls out of the driveway and turn 
around with the same smile on my face. I walk to my house and walk in, 
nobody was home. Plopping down on the couch, I sigh. It was gonna be fun 
having a girlfriend...
