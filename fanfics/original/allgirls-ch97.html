Than falling out of darkness still to see

Without a premonition, could you tell me where we stand?

I&#39;d hate to lose this light before we land

And when I feel like I can feel once again

Let me stay awhile, soak it in awhile

If we can hold on, we can fix what is wrong

Buy a little time for this head of mine

Haven for us

&quot;Wet Cement&quot;

&quot;...That was good. That was really...really good. It feels so good...to 
be here again.&quot; Sigh.

&quot;I never thought I would miss you so much...or need you so bad...or be 
so happy with you around. Go on, you can say it. I did something 
idiotic.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;re you talkin&#39; about? We both did something stupid. We&#39;re both at 
fault here. Just...gimme time to blame meself, too. I let you go, after 
all.&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I...abandoned you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, for the love o&#39; yer young life, and who can blame ya for that?&quot; 
Pause. &quot;Do you think...this time it&#39;s for good?&quot;

&quot;Mm, I hope so, my sweet Gabrielle. How foolish I was to give you up 
like that! I can&#39;t believe it! You must think I am the worst person 
ever.&quot;

&quot;But if I thought that, precious Lilian, I wouldn&#39;t have made sweet 
passionate love to you just now.&quot; Laughter. The albino drew her beloved 
up and drank deep the sweet love-nectar of her girlfriend&#39;s mouth, 
feeling soft, salty skin soaked light with sweat. They sighed and moaned 
softly, then rested, bare skin against bare skin, red hair meshing 
faintly with silvery locks. &quot;I&#39;m so glad,&quot; Gabrielle said quietly, &quot;that 
we both came to our senses.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s strange that we broke up not long after my 
birthday, and got back together not long after yours?&quot;

&quot;...Oh yeah, I never thought of it like that.&quot; Lilian smiled sadly.

&quot;By the way, Happy Birthday, sweet one. I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t come to your 
party...and I&#39;m so sorry I dumped you. Do you forgive me?&quot; O&#39;Shannon 
smiled sweetly.

&quot;Of course. Don&#39;t worry about me party; me other friends couldn&#39;t make 
it as well. I had a quiet one. And didn&#39;t I say that I didn&#39;t blame you 
for our separation? Ramona was a catch, to be sure. I&#39;d still like to 
meet her some day. And let&#39;s not forget I gave you up without a fight, 
so like I said, again, we&#39;re both at fault, love.&quot; Lilian smiled 
dreamily, her fingers amidst a sea of reddish bliss as she combed 
through her lover&#39;s hair.

&quot;Gabrielle, meine schatzie, love of my life... I lost you and my sanity; 
I gave them up; I sold them off for my selfishness. Thank God I got them 
both back!&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; she whispered, &quot;don&#39;t cry, Lil. Don&#39;t cry.&quot; Kisses against moist 
sobbing skin, smiles and gentle stares, love after love: &quot;Let&#39;s put it 
behind us now. The fact of the matter is that we&#39;re both sorry, and 
we&#39;ve both forgiven each other, and we&#39;re back together again, to stay! 
Let&#39;s not mix up cement that&#39;s just been laid.&quot; Lilian gave her lover a 
confused look, though in that dark room, it was hard to see.

&quot;Wha? Cement?&quot;

&quot;Oh, some analogy I heard somebody say; I don&#39;t know how to word it. But 
the idea is that our relationship is back to the way it&#39;s supposed to 
be, and we should just be glad of it. Don&#39;t let sleeping dogs lie, I 
suppose.&quot; Lilian chuckled faintly and caressed her lover&#39;s beautiful 
skin, two white hands going everywhere, stopping at last at her lips.

&quot;I think you have the expression wrong, but I know what you&#39;re saying. 
Let&#39;s let the cement dry, then, if that&#39;s the case.&quot;

&quot;Oh, but cement takes a long time to dry.&quot;

&quot;Ja, but when it&#39;s done, it&#39;s worth it. So strong, so firm!&quot; She hissed 
lustfully and squeezed Gabrielle&#39;s arms, wriggling her latent muscles. 
The redhead laughed and tickled Lilian: it was the first chapter of a 
brand-new story for them, or else a revision of an old one, a favorite, 
one they loved very much and only got better with the improvement.

......

When Abi Cerio agreed to give Janna Raulson a second chance, she 
compared their relationship to wet cement as well. Raulson didn&#39;t expect 
Abi to agree to another date, especially since she had sworn harshly 
against the younger woman the last time her heart had been broken, but 
desperation, curiosity, and strange convenience made many minds forget 
past woes, or at worst, look at them as being &quot;not that bad&quot;. Such was 
their case: Abi offered, and Janna accepted.

&quot;This relationship is like wet cement, dear,&quot; Abi told her on their 
date. &quot;Initially, it&#39;s all mixed up, but cement needs to be mixed up in 
order to be cement. Likewise, no relationship is without its quirks. Now 
once we&#39;ve gotten over the fact that our relationship is going to be 
strange, we can move on to actually making something solid. Typically 
cement is put into a square, as you see on the sidewalk, but let&#39;s 
pretend ours is more like...a sphere, or something.&quot;

&quot;Why a sphere?&quot;

&quot;When cement dries, it has to take some kind of shape,&quot; Abi told her. 
&quot;Cement can&#39;t stay wet and muddy forever; otherwise it&#39;s no good. And 
the same with any relationship: it has to be formed into something. And 
of course, once it&#39;s formed into that, it&#39;s very hard to make it into 
something else, at least not without great effort and pains. I&#39;m just 
saying let&#39;s make it a sphere because that&#39;s the first nice thing that 
came into my head.&quot;

&quot;...Oh. I think I understand.&quot; Abi gave her new (or old) girlfriend a 
smile, then a friendly peck on the cheek.

&quot;That&#39;s good. Well, to finish the analogy, once cement is dry, it&#39;s very 
strong, right? Not easily broken. And when any relationship finds its 
shape and solidifies, it can stand up to a whole lot. It&#39;s not 
invincible by any means, but certainly strong.&quot;

&quot;And you know,&quot; added Janna, &quot;if cement is removed from the sidewalk, 
it&#39;s a very difficult process, and I&#39;m sure it hurts.&quot; Abi made a face; 
Janna got the feeling she had screwed up.

&quot;Mm...you could...say it like that. It sounds like you understand in any 
case. So, Miss Raulson, where would you like to go on our new date? I&#39;ve 
got some places in mind, but I&#39;d love to hear your input.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m game for anything,&quot; Janna said with a gesture, &quot;as long as it&#39;s 
nowhere near a casino. You know me and my gambling.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, really. Well, since you&#39;re so poor, I&#39;ll restrain myself when it 
comes to dinner. I&#39;m on a diet anyway.&quot;

......

It was nice to get out once in awhile&#151;Em was beginning to think she 
actually lived in the school science lab&#151;and being with her fellow 
instructors was a plus. But the real fun of the day was Sarah, her new 
girlfriend (technically speaking), and what a sweet, refreshing woman 
she was! She had the brains of Dr. Andrews without the acidic core, the 
personality of Andeira Torvald without the flakiness, the cheer of Janna 
Raulson without the bad habits, and to her delight, she was unavoidably 
drawn to &quot;wild&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; women, and who was wilder than Miss McGowen 
herself?

&quot;I dunno why we ever broke up,&quot; she stated to her friends (she and Sarah 
went double-dating with Elsie Post and Chef Vee, a couple far too 
sickeningly sweet for their own good). &quot;We&#39;re practically perfect for 
each other. I suppose some things merit multiple discoveries. You can&#39;t 
tell everything there is about anything unless you&#39;ve given it another 
look.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Sarah with a laugh; &quot;you&#39;ve &#145;examined&#39; me several times 
all over, Professor.&quot; The two of them laughed, and Elspeth and Sonia 
might&#39;ve blushed if they didn&#39;t have stories to tell. It was actually 
more like a strange fairy tale: they had been friends for years, but 
doomed to always run into the wrong kind of love situation. Elspeth 
hopelessly pined over her old teacher, and Sonia...well, it was best not 
to dig that up again. They were fortunate to have their eyes opened, to 
realize how great it would be to see each other&#151;not only as friends, but 
lovers as well&#151;and to be able to put all their past dealings behind 
them.

&quot;So your cement is just about dried,&quot; Sarah told them. She explained the 
analogy, but they didn&#39;t quite get it.

&quot;Well, we&#39;re still taking things day by day,&quot; answered Elspeth. &quot;But I&#39;m 
sure we&#39;ve got the right idea, this time at least. I know I&#39;ve made the 
right choice.&quot; She and Sonia stared dreamily into each other&#39;s eyes, and 
made a spectacle of kissing each other and giggling. Everyone at Stanton 
had long ago given up on cooing over the two, saying how badly they 
needed this love in their life, and how great they were together: now, 
they were just sickening. They didn&#39;t need to get a room, they needed a 
whole country to themselves.

&quot;This is gonna take awhile,&quot; Emma murmured to her date. &quot;You want to go 
to the bathroom? I feel like puking my lungs out.&quot;

&quot;Oh hush, they&#39;re so darling together,&quot; Sarah hissed, slapping her&#151;but 
in truth, even she had gotten tired of the two. Well...as long as they 
were happy, she could tolerate it. Their cement was in no danger of 
breaking: Sonia was clingy and Elspeth was desperate. She and Emma 
exchanged a glance, all but forgotten by their acquaintances, and knew 
they&#39;d have to ride out the rest of the evening by themselves.

&quot;Check please,&quot; said McGowen, raising her hand.

......

Even though they were officially back together again, Blake and Usha 
were both so busy that they rarely had time to spend with each other. 
Usha was straining with all her activities (President of the Junior 
Class, member of the debate team, member of the Gay and Straight 
Alliance, President of the Death Cult of Bush), so all her free time was 
focused on homework and sleeping&#151;frankly about all she could spare. 
Blake might&#39;ve felt left out if she didn&#39;t have her own agenda; being on 
track and the soccer team debilitated her schedule as well.

Whenever they could spare moments together, they went and pored over 
their schedules, seeking out a long stretch of free time where they 
would have each other to themselves for a whole day, at least. With 
Spring Break now over, this was hard to do, but they managed to find 
holes. There was a special field trip planned early in April, and they 
also had a few weekends to steal, but those wouldn&#39;t come up until after 
all the games were over. In the meantime, they would have to be content 
with these short meetings and every class they took together. They 
hardly had any time at all, even to spend the night together, and they 
were usually too exhausted to &quot;attend&quot; to each other.

&quot;We gotta get new lives,&quot; Blake moaned with a smile. Usha agreed.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have opportunities like this in the future, though, 
so we have to take them. By the way, when&#39;s your first game?&quot;

&quot;Uh...I think it&#39;s later this week.&quot;

&quot;You think? You&#39;re in it, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she said, digging her finger inside her ear to scratch it. &quot;But 
I don&#39;t pay attention to all that. You know me, I&#39;m all over the place.&quot;

&quot;Well, you show lots of focus on the field...and in bed,&quot; muttered 
Krishnan shyly. Blake beamed.

&quot;That&#39;s because I have two very wonderful things to keep my mind on! 
What&#39;s better than the greatest game on Earth and the sexiest woman 
alive?&quot;

&quot;Oh, stop,&quot; said Usha, chuckling softly. They shared a rare embrace and 
went back to work. Usha would be at Blake&#39;s game, no question about 
that, and every other one after that, even if it wasn&#39;t important. She 
used to obsess over the women&#39;s soccer team for practical reasons, but 
now that she was in love with one of the players, she had a whole other 
reason for going. Besides, who else was going to greet Blake in the 
locker room and &quot;help&quot; her wash up?

&quot;So, in conclusion,&quot; Blake pointed, &quot;this field trip&#39;s our best bet. 
Hmm. I&#39;m gonna have to talk to Gab and Lil sometime later. I&#39;ve got an 
idea, maybe some way for all of us to get together again, like we did 
before autumn.&quot;

&quot;You mean that swimming pool incident?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Lil&#39;s got an indoor pool at her estate, but I don&#39;t know if 
she&#39;ll let us use it. I mean, I&#39;m pretty sure; I just haven&#39;t asked her 
permission. Chances are good, though.&quot; Usha thought it was a good idea, 
and as the lunch bell rang to separate them, she promised to dress extra 
nice for that day. Blake couldn&#39;t help but stare at her as she left, but 
she didn&#39;t focus on Usha&#39;s shapely rear end&#151;rather, her hair: so long, 
silky, black as tar and scented so deliciously! It felt even better 
matted against her chest during the night as they made love...

&quot;Whoa!&quot; she exclaimed, snapping out of her daydream. She noticed the 
cafeteria clock, telling her she was already late for her next class. 
Rubbing her head she muttered, &quot;I gotta stop doing that!&quot;, and ran off 
before she got in real trouble.

......

Nomi Nakatori woke up, worry already creasing her face. It was that same 
fantasy of hers, all over again. She was with Amina, and the two 
were...engaged with each other, though at a level far more passionate 
than they had ever reached in real life. And Nomi, Nomi herself, had 
Amina&#39;s panties off and was...gorging herself on the other girl&#39;s 
private area! She took a deep breath and covered her face, an attempt to 
bring herself back into the living world. If it had been a dream, she 
might not have been so worried, because she couldn&#39;t control those. But 
a fantasy was pure wishful imagination, and those she could make by 
herself.

&quot;I&#39;m not gay,&quot; she whispered, doubting her words. &quot;...Am I?&quot; She knew 
she had to talk to somebody, and there was only one person in the whole 
house she was comfortable with: her own mother. Rising out of bed and 
throwing a robe on, she waddled through the dark house and came into the 
kitchen, knowing her mother would be there making breakfast. The smell 
of bacon and faint morning perfume drew her in, and she tried to smile 
as her eyes met those of her mother&#39;s.

&quot;Morning, dear,&quot; said the senior Nakatori, pouring milk in a glass.

&quot;Hey mom. Uh, listen, can I talk to you for a moment?&quot; Her mother 
smiled, stopped everything she was doing, and sat down, two glasses in 
hand.

&quot;I&#39;m at your disposal. What&#39;s on your mind?&quot;

&quot;Uh...well, you know my friend Amina, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and I know her mother too.&quot; That was putting it lightly; the two 
had slept together once, during a &quot;shared weak moment&quot;.

&quot;Well, uh, I kind of...have something delicate to ask you about that.&quot; 
Her mother was a patient woman, so she kept her tongue and listened for 
the big one. Nomi took a deep breath, wanting to word this just right. 
&quot;Mom, do you think...having sexual thoughts about...other girls makes me 
gay?&quot; Mrs. Nakatori smiled softly. Having been in this situation before, 
she had wrestled with the question herself, so she knew what her 
daughter felt and what she needed to hear.

&quot;Well, let me put it this way. If you&#39;re tempted to steal something&#151;say, 
a book from the store&#151;that&#39;s not entirely wrong, but if you actually go 
and do it, it is. Everybody&#39;s tempted, dear, even the Lord Himself was. 
But it&#39;s the act of following that temptation and doing it, such as 
stealing the book, that makes a person a thief. I know it&#39;s a bad 
analogy, but you get what I&#39;m saying, don&#39;t you? In other words, you&#39;re 
not entirely gay unless you act upon it. It&#39;s hard to control our 
thoughts, so don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing anything wrong.&quot;

Nomi smiled at her mother&#39;s wisdom and thanked her. She was afraid that 
her mother would think her a homosexual&#151;or worse, in love with Amina&#151;but 
instead the woman went an entirely different path and didn&#39;t assume a 
single thing. Of course she suspected, what with her daughter and Amina 
being so close, but she knew better to pry into such affairs, as much as 
she didn&#39;t want her daughter doing the same. Nomi might have stayed at 
that table longer and talked with her mother some more, but Papa 
Nakatori came in, yawning and mumbling, and Nomi wanted nothing to do 
with him, so she left.

.........
Is love so important?

Yes. Love is everything.

Then why are people alone and lonely?

I don&#39;t know. I guess they haven&#39;t found the right person yet.

Perhaps they never will...

No. That&#39;s not true. Everyone will find the one destined for them. 
Everyone needs someone to anchor them to this insane place.

What if you find your anchor, only to realize it belongs to another 
boat?

Then you drift away... To the land of memories.

Land of memories?

The place where only happiness exists. A marvelous land that holds 
wonders beyond any man has ever imagined. It is a place to forget, a 
place where no sadness will creep into your soul.

It must be a wonderful place...

Do you wish to go there?

No. I don&#39;t belong there.

So where do you belong?

By her side.

She doesn&#39;t even want you there.

I know.

It must be painful, living like this, watching her with someone else.

Whoever said I was living? ...I&#39;m merely alive.

&quot;But even that&#39;s not much,&quot; mumbled Alexis Walker, looking over her 
words. Truly, these written words were an expression of herself, not 
just the character she was writing about. But at least the character was 
a work of fiction, something that had never lived and would never know 
the level of pain she spoke of. Alexis did know all that pain; she wrote 
from harsh experience. She had found a love and lost it, and so went 
crawling into her story, fingers numbly ticking away at the keyboard, to 
express her new sorrow. In the end, the character would be so overcome 
by grief that she would kill herself, and nobody would be around to 
comfort her, to pick up her broken body, or even to mourn her. She would 
just lie there for the buzzards to pick clean, her soul swirling into 
the bleak vortex of everlasting sorrow, the woman&#39;s own personal 
Hell&#151;for what was heaven without her?

Alexis finished the chapter, sat back, and read it carefully. She didn&#39;t 
even know if she was going to finish it. What was the point, really? 
Nobody ever read her stuff, and if they did, they sure wouldn&#39;t like it. 
Much like herself...

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she murmured, grumbling with a weariness beyond her years. &quot;What 
fool would want me? Let&#39;s face it. Nobody cares for me. Nobody gives a 
shit if I live or die. I&#39;ve got nobody on my side anyway; why bother 
living at all?&quot; She had asked herself that question several times, and 
each time came very close to suicide, but every time she had been 
spared, though not by the actions of others. She had to save herself; 
nobody was ever around to convince her not to die. If only that weren&#39;t 
so! If there was even one soul alive that could talk to her, tell her 
she was worth something, keep her there by their love, then she knew she 
would no longer be miserable. She would&#39;ve at last found her anchor, and 
would drift no more.

&quot;But small chance of that happening.&quot;

Alexis masturbated until she fell asleep, but what point was there in 
that? It was just a brief, brief pleasure amidst a world full of pain, 
populated by people too stupid, too selfish, too inconsiderate and too 
ugly to be anything else. What kind of a God could make such things 
anyway? Then again, if evolution were true, some people merely looked 
human on the outside, but were little more than protozoa on the inside. 
And if there was a God, then He had truly lost His mind, if ever He had 
one to begin with. If something went wrong, look to the creator, and oh 
how wrong the world was!

There seemed no point in living in a world run by a mad, sadistic, 
lying, hypocritical God, nor in a place where every human being cared 
only for himself, or herself, and never for one another. There was no 
such thing as a kind soul or a caring person, or somebody good enough to 
step in and stop the madness. Alexis knew; she had looked, hard. She 
went all over the place trying to find that one special someone, and had 
failed. There was nobody like that in Stanton, and what few friends she 
had were becoming more and more distant, and less receptive of her. Her 
roommates were all right, but they were hardly around, and her family...

It was best not to think about it.

The thing that bothered X the most was the churches she had been to. One 
church all but lynched her when they found out she was a homosexual; 
another seemed cool until they required a membership of her. Oh, yes, 
she just had to join the little nonsense cult in order to benefit from 
everything. She hit the road that very minute and didn&#39;t look back, no 
matter how many people insisted that she had been misinformed. Two more 
churches didn&#39;t seem to care for her at all&#151;the people either ignored 
her, strayed from her completely, or gave her disapproving looks&#151;and the 
one church she thought she&#39;d be welcomed in, a Unitarian, was just too 
strange for her to bear. And if God could not help her, then nobody 
could.

&quot;So what&#39;s the point in living,&quot; she said, &quot;if nobody cares and you 
won&#39;t be missed anyway? I dunno. I always managed to convince myself I 
had a purpose, but it was really just that damn story I was making. If I 
ever finished the bitch, I&#39;d be done with it all, not much else to do 
except end it. Yeah, like Shelly.&quot; (Shelly was the girl in her story 
that was going to kill herself out of grief) The similarity was 
striking. X wondered what it would be like to die&#151;endless suffering or 
endless bliss, but she could handle either one.

After all, what was Hell? Life without God? She had that now. Absolute 
agony? As if she didn&#39;t feel that every day. Darkness, loneliness, 
sorrow? Check, check, check. Well. Hell sounded a lot like life on 
Earth. And if by some cosmic mistake (which now she could count on 
since, hey, God was just a big screw-up anyway) she landed in Heaven, 
all the better, right? She could just walk up and punch that egomaniacal 
deity in His holy face, maybe break a few ribs in the process. What 
could He do that He hadn&#39;t already done anyway? Killing her would be a 
blessing; it would be farewell to this cruel life!

&quot;Goodbye cruel world,&quot; she mused to herself, chuckling a little. Of all 
the suicide-related clich&eacute;s! There was no way she was going to end her 
life like that. If she was going to die, she&#39;d probably leave no note so 
that whoever found her body, if anyone, would be mystified for days, 
maybe their whole life. Why, they would ask, is this thing here in my 
way? And then kick it aside&#151;yeah, yeah, that sounded about right.

Alexis went to the kitchen, opened the drawer, and drew out a knife.

Why wait, she reasoned, as she embraced the warm flower.

............

Alexis Walker knew she wasn&#39;t dead because she smelled that familiar 
hospital stink, and could feel IV needles in her arms, and could hear 
the steady pulse of the machine that measured her heart rate, and could 
feel slight dizziness and pain in her abdomen&#151;but why was she alive? Had 
she failed somehow? Oh yes, that made a lot of sense; she couldn&#39;t even 
die right. But if she was here in this hospital, then...did somebody 
care for her? Or was this some sick afterlife?

&quot;Are we awake?&quot; came a doctor&#39;s voice. Alexis&#39; vision was blurry, so she 
couldn&#39;t quite see the doctor. She closed her eyes and played it by ear.

&quot;Fuck,&quot; she mumbled, nearly drooling it out.

&quot;I see we are,&quot; he mumbled. &quot;Well, you&#39;re past the critical phase, 
although you&#39;ve lost a lot of blood. Yet somehow you pulled through, 
probably because you didn&#39;t retract the knife from your body.&quot;

&quot;...Whuh?&quot; she mumbled.

&quot;You don&#39;t know? It acted as a kind of plug for your blood. Oh, it 
penetrated, all right, but you didn&#39;t bleed profusely. We should also be 
thankful you didn&#39;t hit any organs; otherwise you&#39;d still be in surgery. 
Can you move your arm?&quot; X could barely move her eyes, and that didn&#39;t do 
her a bit of good anyway. She found out she could flop her arm around a 
little, but she couldn&#39;t grasp anything: he wanted her to sign some 
papers. She smiled just a little at the thought of it; she would most 
likely put an &quot;X&quot; on the paper. The smile turned into a laugh, and she 
managed to scrawl the letter onto the paper.

&quot;Well,&quot; came another voice, &quot;you seem to be in good spirits. That&#39;s 
either very nice or very disturbing. What happened, the knife just 
suddenly jumped out of the drawer and hit you?&quot; Alexis recognized that 
voice, and before a faintness took over her, she looked up, cleared her 
vision, and smiled.

&quot;Your visitor,&quot; explained the doctor. &quot;I&#39;ll leave you two alone.&quot; Alexis 
swallowed, mumbling for water, and was given a glass. Wow! That did 
wonders! No wonder she couldn&#39;t speak, her mouth was dry.

&quot;Carly,&quot; she whispered hoarsely, &quot;to what do I owe this visit?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d say about a thousand dollars,&quot; said the woman, Carlisle &quot;Wrench&quot; 
Renchina. Alexis suddenly felt ill, and not from the surgery she must&#39;ve 
gotten.

&quot;A thousand bucks? Bullshit!&quot;

&quot;I got a bargain because I put my medical insurance in up with yours, 
plus I donated some of my blood. We&#39;re the same type, you know.&quot; To 
prove it, she weakly flexed her arm, showing a proud bandage over her 
bicep. &quot;And let me tell you, X,&quot; she continued, &quot;it hurt like Hell. I 
won&#39;t be able to go into work tomorrow because of it. It&#39;s a miracle I&#39;m 
even sitting up, let alone talking to you.&quot; She did look a little dizzy, 
but not so much that she couldn&#39;t smile and show off her bravado.

Alexis felt her heart suddenly lighten as the situation became clear to 
her. Once she passed out, she must&#39;ve been lying there on the kitchen 
floor for who-knows how long, until one of her roommates (clearly Carly) 
came in, saw the mess, called an ambulance, and had X rushed off to the 
hospital. That she had stayed behind to give blood and visit her 
roommate was even more touching, so X gave her plenty of room to be mad.

&quot;What in the hell were you thinking, X?&quot; she asked, ruffling the younger 
woman&#39;s hair. &quot;Suicide? That&#39;s not you. Come on, you freak me out just 
by saying it; I never thought you&#39;d go through with it. Damn it, woman, 
don&#39;t you ever do something like that again or I&#39;ll really kill you.&quot;

&quot;God, I&#39;m sorry, I just&#151;&quot;

&quot;You just weren&#39;t thinking!&quot; she spat, not bothering to hide her tears. 
&quot;You just didn&#39;t think at all, you stupid fat moronic bitch! How could 
you? You&#39;re so...selfish and ignorant. Damn. Don&#39;t you ever do that 
again, I swear. You owe me for this one, Walker.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m...sorry,&quot; she grumbled weakly, and she meant it. &quot;You 
didn&#39;t...deserve any of this. I&#39;m sorry I...dumped all this shit on 
you.&quot;

&quot;You better be damn well sorry about it, fool!&quot; Carly was now openly 
weeping, taking Alexis&#39; hand to her face and caressing it, making it 
wetter by the moment. &quot;Don&#39;t you...ever...do anything like that again. 
Don&#39;t you ever, okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ll make it up to you.&quot;

&quot;How?! You don&#39;t have a job, you barely do anything around the house, 
and your grades are...&quot; Carly choked up, collapsed, and wept more, not 
bothering to hide any emotions. For anyone who didn&#39;t know her, she was 
a tough girl with a tough job, reliable and strong, and as good as any 
man at anything. But Carly was feminine and soft when people weren&#39;t 
looking&#151;strangers, anyway&#151;and had as much wide a range of emotions as 
anyone else did. She reached over and took Carly&#39;s hair into her 
fingers, so depressed and yet so elated at the same time.

So, despite everything she believed, there really was somebody that 
cared for her.

&quot;Let me work for you,&quot; said X, her voice stronger now. &quot;Let me be hired 
on as one of your mechanics. I&#39;ll let you have ninety percent of all of 
my paychecks until we&#39;re square again.&quot;

&quot;Damn right you&#39;ll give me your paychecks!&quot; managed Carly through sobs. 
She cleared up a little, wiped her face, and looked at Alexis seriously. 
&quot;You really want to work in my garage?&quot;

&quot;I figure it&#39;s the best way to pay you back.&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah, and you do know more about bikes than anyone I know. Well, 
I&#39;ll think about it, but for the moment, you rest up. I gotta go and 
call in to tell my pals I&#39;m not gonna be in today.&quot; She leaned in and 
kissed Alexis on the cheek, then stood and wobbled her way to the door. 
Before she left, she turned around and added, &quot;Oh, and X? If you 
ever...need to talk to somebody, or you&#39;re feeling really 
depressed...come to me, okay? Don&#39;t kill yourself. You know my office is 
always open.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re always so busy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m never that busy,&quot; she managed, tearing up again. &quot;Not that much, 
you idiot! So just...promise me you&#39;ll come and talk to me if you need 
to, okay?&quot; Alexis promised she would, and watched Carly leave the room. 
A great burden seemed lifted off her chest&#151;maybe the near-death 
experience cleared her head, or she had really died and was now reborn 
in a much better world&#151;and for the first time in ages she smiled without 
needing a reason for it.

When Carly came back, Alexis learned that her theory was right, but she 
had only been unconscious for about fifteen minutes, maybe less.

The operation, however, took several hours. Carly never left the 
hospital in that time.

She was released three days later, after signing more papers than she 
cared to count.

And in spite of everything she had already done, Carly attended to 
Alexis very lovingly for the next few days, at least until she hired her 
on as one of her grease monkeys. After that, well...Alexis figured she 
deserved the roasting. But at least now she knew that Carly did it out 
of love.

Epilogue

Alexis got off lucky. One of her roommates was a true friend, a selfless 
individual with a big heart and a loving demeanor. She had been saved 
from death, but many others are not so lucky. Many who feel as X 
felt&#151;that they are unloved, uncared-for, and unimportant, do not have 
such happy endings. Many good people die out of grief and despair, and 
some are even doomed to die and die again. As one who has felt the touch 
of despondency several times before, I urge all of you to not let this 
go if you see the signs. Show people you love them, show them you care. 
Sit next to the person who&#39;s all by themselves. Talk to people who don&#39;t 
have anybody to talk to. Be a listener when people need to talk, and a 
friend when they are lonely. So many people need love in the world, and 
yet so few ever receive it. Just something to think about.</pre>
