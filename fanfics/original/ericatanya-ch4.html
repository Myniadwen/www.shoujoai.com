<h1>Erica and Tanya: or You Ought to Be in Pictures! (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/ericatanya-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The cellphone&#39;s shrill beep startled Tanya so badly that she nearly spit 
out her cup of morning coffee. The blonde grabbed it before it could do 
any more damage and hit receive, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Would you mind telling me if you&#39;re planning to take up with a 
notorious lesbian?&quot; the irritable female voice demanded.

Tanya blinked a few times, trying to register that before tentatively 
asking, &quot;Brit?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Brit your loyal agent,&quot; Tanya could almost hear her agent&#39;s scowl 
as she continued, &quot;Now could you please tell me what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;I only got up a little while ago Brit,&quot; Tanya tried to be patient, &quot;and 
I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Brit cursed softly. A calming breath and she continued on in 
more even tones, &quot;You&#39;re on the front page of the National Examiner, and 
I quote,&quot; she took a breath, &quot;Erica Simmons seen at lesbian club with 
girlfriend Tanya Clark.&quot;

&quot;Former lesbian club,&quot; Tanya could feel a headache coming on as she 
continued, &quot;and we just had dinner together.&quot;

&quot;Well, the papers are drawing their own conclusions,&quot; Brit said. &quot;I 
should get started on damage control. and if any reporter calls you I 
want you to deny....&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Tanya said firmly.

Brit sounded surprised, &quot;No?&quot;

&quot;I am not denying that I know Erica or that we&#39;re friends, Brit,&quot; Tanya 
said. She paused, &quot;God, I hope she hasn&#39;t seen that paper yet, I&#39;d 
better call her....&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Brit sounded just a bit confused as she said, &quot;so what do you 
want me to tell the news media?&quot;

&quot;That Erica and I are friends,&quot; Tanya sighed, &quot;and that two friends can 
go out to dinner without there being romance involved.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; and Brit hung up.

Tanya dialed a number she had started to use more regularly, waiting as 
it rang. &quot;You muckraking sons of bitches better leave Tanya alone or 
I&#39;ll...&quot; Erica snarled out.

&quot;Erica, it&#39;s me,&quot; Tanya quickly cut the threat short, wondering what 
Erica had been having to deal with this morning.

&quot;Tanya, I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Erica sighed. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize that you&#39;d be 
targeted like this, or I never would have....&quot; she trailed off.

&quot;I&#39;m a big girl Erica,&quot; Tanya drank more of her coffee, &quot;and wasn&#39;t I 
the one who mentioned the tabloids pairing us up to you?&quot;

Erica paused, &quot;Good point.&quot;

Tanya felt herself smiling slightly, &quot;So what were you going to do to 
that reporter you were threatening, anyway?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t want to know,&quot; Erica sighed softly. More tentatively she 
said, &quot;If you need to distance yourself from me, I&#39;ll understand.&quot;

&quot;My agent suggested that,&quot; Tanya sighed, &quot;I told her no.&quot; She smiled 
wryly, &quot;First time I&#39;ve done that in a while, must have been a shock.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; and Tanya could almost hear the warm smile that Erica had on 
her face. &quot;The good news is,&quot; she said seriously, &quot;the next big scandal 
will bump us off the tabloids.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s waiting for the scandal that will drive us nuts,&quot; Tanya agreed. 
She frowned as her phone beeped, &quot;I&#39;ve got Simon trying to call me.&quot;

&quot;Put him through,&quot; Erica sounded amused as she continued, &quot;let&#39;s hear 
what pearls of wisdom our director has to offer.&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Simon sounded warmly amused as he said, &quot;if you&#39;re going to 
do something to generate publicity for my film, you should tell me 
first.&quot;

&quot;We didn&#39;t....&quot; Tanya started.

&quot;Don&#39;t mind him,&quot; Erica said wearily, &quot;that&#39;s just Simon&#39;s idea of 
humor.&quot; She dropped her voice to a growl, &quot;At least it better be.&quot;

&quot;I hope this won&#39;t hurt the film,&quot; Tanya offered tentatively.

Simon actually laughed aloud at that. &quot;Dearest, I have several 
distributors that are talking to me about the film,&quot; he sounded jubilant 
as he continued, &quot;distributors who wouldn&#39;t have even talked to me 
before this hit!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so happy for you,&quot; Erica said dryly, &quot;but personally I&#39;m more 
worried about the damage this could do to Tanya&#39;s career.&quot;

&quot;Hm. Point,&quot; Simon sighed. He brightened, &quot;But Erica has managed to 
weather this sort of thing before, there&#39;s no reason Tanya couldn&#39;t.&quot;

Tanya made a face, &quot;Erica is an out lesbian, and pardon my bluntness but 
she&#39;s so notorious that she&#39;s actually made that work for her.&quot; She 
munched a cookie, &quot;I&#39;m just her straight friend who got tarred with the 
same brush.&quot;

&quot;Notorious?&quot; Erica echoed with a laugh, &quot;I&#39;m complimented.&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d like that,&quot; Tanya said, finishing off another cookie.

&quot;You know....&quot; Simon mused aloud, &quot;I think there might be a way to turn 
this to our advantage.&quot; Briskly he asked, &quot;Can you two be at my office 
with your agents later today?&quot;

&quot;Simon, what are you thinking?&quot; Erica asked suspiciously.

&quot;I&#39;ll explain this afternoon,&quot; Simon&#39;s voice had a happy bounce to it as 
he added, &quot;see you both then!&quot; With that he just hung up.

&quot;I hate it when he does that,&quot; Tanya sighed.

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Erica agreed. They talked a few more minutes before 
she sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll see you at Simon&#39;s place, all right?&quot;

&quot;See you there,&quot; Tanya said before she hung up.

Later that afternoon Brit met Tanya at the downtown office building. The 
redheaded business woman had a sour look on her face as she growled, 
&quot;Who does he think he is?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s the director,&quot; Tanya shrugged philosophically, &quot;that means he&#39;s an 
temperamental, eccentric drama queen. However, he&#39;s also good at what he 
does, so....&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Brit agreed. The two women walked inside, nodding to the 
guard in the lobby. The elevator took them upstairs, and they walked 
down the hall to where they could hear a loud conversation going on.

&quot;Simon, you have got to be kidding me,&quot; Erica growled.

&quot;Now let&#39;s wait until Tanya gets here,&quot; Simon sounded soothing.

Brit and Tanya exchanged a look, then Tanya knocked loudly before going 
inside. Simon sat behind his desk, four chairs set out in front of it. 
Erica sat in one, a older man sitting in the other, the remaining two 
clearly for them.

&quot;Max,&quot; Simon nodded towards the sitting man, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Tanya 
and her agent, Ms. Brittany Alexander.&quot;

&quot;Brit,&quot; she corrected him firmly. She waved Tanya to a seat before 
sitting down and asking, &quot;All right, what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;This is going to be lovely,&quot; Erica covered her face with her hand.

Tanya raised her eyebrow at Erica, then turned back to Simon. He smiled 
bravely, &quot;You see, this controversy could be turned to our advantage.&quot; 
Simon looked between Tanya and Erica, &quot;What I&#39;m proposing is that you 
two pose as girlfriends until the debut.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Tanya blurted.

&quot;It&#39;s not my idea,&quot; Erica quickly said.

Brit frowned, &quot;That would be career suicide for my client.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Simon said, &quot;not if the two publicly make it clear it was a 
performance.&quot; He grinned evilly, &quot;I think at the night of the opening.&quot;

&quot;It would certainly put one over on the tabloids, wouldn&#39;t it,&quot; Tanya 
murmured to herself thoughtfully.</pre>
