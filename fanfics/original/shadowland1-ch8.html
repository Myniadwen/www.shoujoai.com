Blood Soaked Feelings

Jenn carried the redhead down to the nurse&#39;s office and was surprised 
when the nurse did not even bat an eye at the bleeding girl in her arms 
or her own torn clothes and believed her entirely when she told the 
nurse that Kimberly only fell. The nurse led the two girls into her 
office and left them alone. Jenn gently set Kimberly onto one of the 
beds then quickly closed the curtain around the bed. She grabbed a first 
aid kit and bandages then returned to Kim&#39;s side. 

Thoughts rushed through Jenn&#39;s head while she stared down at the girl 
before her. &#39;What have I gotten myself into this time?&#39; She stopped for 
a moment with the first aid kit held closely to her chest, struggling 
with the feelings within her heart. She shook her head it can&#39;t be 
possible. There&#39;s no way that Kimberly could ever have feelings for her, 
so why was she even thinking about it?

 &quot;Friends.&quot; She stated aloud, &quot;I&#39;ll just be her friend. Everyone needs a 
friend, right?&quot; Confident that she had convinced herself, Jenn sat down 
next to the bed and opened the kit and stopped again. She thought back 
to that boy holding Kim. Hurt welled up in her heart as she remembered 
watching the girl of her dreams kiss a boy. It felt as if someone had 
ripped out her heart and thrown it to the wolves. She could still feel 
the sharp pang jabbed through her chest, clenching her chest she tried 
hard to force the agony away.

Jenn gazed down at the sleeping form of the girl who just rescued her, 
confused, as to why did she get between the two of them? She could have 
just turned around. She could have not got involved, except that there 
was something about that boy that felt wrong. Her eyes fell on the blood 
smeared down the front of Kim&#39;s shirt, then her attention moved to the 
crimson that had transferred on her own shirt while carrying the girl. 
It was real, she could smell it and feel it against her skin, and it 
could not be a dream? Or if it were it would be the most vivid one she 
had ever had.

She leaned over Kimberly and waved a hand in front of the girl&#39;s face. 
&quot;Hey, you going to wake up?&quot; She inquired softly. There was no answer. 
Jenn swallowed hard as her gaze shifted back to the blood. It was not 
like she was afraid of blood, far from it. It was more like she felt 
embarrassed to take the girl&#39;s shirt off so she could bandage her 
wounds. She laughed to herself then pulled off the girl&#39;s blazer before 
grabbed a pair of scissors to cut away at Kimberly&#39;s shirt, starting 
from the holes Lauren had left. 

Her hands moved swiftly as they stripped off Kimberly&#39;s shirt and tie, 
then bra and began to clean up the blood with a damp cloth. She was 
amazed to see that the bleeding had stopped all on its own, but this 
allowed her to concentrate more on bandaging and cleaning up without 
worrying about having to call a hospital. She tenderly dabbed the damp 
cloth at Kimberly&#39;s soft white skin. Trying hard to keep her mind on the 
task at hand however she could not take her eyes off how beautiful the 
girl looked. More then once she found herself struggling with the need 
to kiss the girl; wondering if that would wake her up like in those 
fairy tales. Jenn quickly shook the thought from her mind and returned 
to bandaging the wound. 

After some struggling Jenn finally managed to satisfactorily wrap up 
Kimberly&#39;s shoulder and chest. She found herself stopping at one point, 
scanning the girl&#39;s arms. They were covered in cut marks, some fresh and 
other partly healed. Not deep enough to kill, nevertheless they still 
looked rather painful and there was a large bruise on her side that 
looked very recent too. She turned her gaze back to Kim&#39;s sleeping face 
and wondered just what was going through the girl&#39;s mind. Was she 
sleeping peacefully or being haunted by something that Jenn could not 
comprehend. Jenn finished off the last of the bandages, fastening them 
in place, then she gently laid the girl back in the bed and pulled the 
covers close to the her chin. 

Jenn turned to leave, however seeing Kimberly lying so defenceless like 
that made it very hard. She told the nurse that she would be right back 
and to tell Kimberly if she woke up. She found a pair of extra uniforms 
in the Gym locker room, changed out of her blood soaked clothes and made 
sure she grabbed some for Kimberly as well. She then took the stairs two 
at a time back up to the roof in search of her book bag. She found it 
undamaged at the far end of the roof. She quickly scooped it up and ran 
as quickly as she could back down to Kimberly&#39;s side.
