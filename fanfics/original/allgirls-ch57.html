&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Vai whispered. &quot;I&#39;m strapped for cash, and I don&#39;t have 
anything nice to wear.&quot;

&quot;You know that won&#39;t be a problem. Remember last time?&quot;

&quot;Avi, I can&#39;t ask you to&#151;&quot;

&quot;Nonsense. You&#39;re the first real friend I&#39;ve made here&#151;well, that wasn&#39;t 
a guy, anyway. You&#39;ve helped me a lot. We understand each other to a 
degree. This is my way of repaying you.&quot;

&quot;Avi...even so, my schedule might conflict with it.&quot;

&quot;Do you have work?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I just started. I can&#39;t not show up.&quot; Rohani sighed.

&quot;That sucks. Are you sure you can&#39;t make it, or possibly ask them to let 
you off?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my first day.&quot; There was a pause.

&quot;Yeah, okay.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry. I actually do wanna come, but you know...no money. 
And a job. Probably a crappy one.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Well, maybe we can get together sometime later. Ethan says he&#39;s 
been looking around for a boyfriend for you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, god.&quot;

&quot;No, really.&quot; Avelina chuckled. Vai groaned.

&quot;Whatever. I gotta go. Sorry.&quot;

&quot;Mm, if you gotta do it...&quot; Click. She frowned and shook her head. Well, 
so much for that, and Ethan was going to be disappointed, too. They both 
liked Vai, and had wanted her to be at the Winter Social. Avelina 
flipped through the phone book and searched for the only other two 
people she genuinely called friends, Farrah and Kula. Calling Vai was 
one thing&#151;the two had become reasonably close since the play and were 
comfortable visiting and calling each other&#151;but Avelina was more shy 
around her other friends. Regardless, Ethan would be proud of her 
initiative.

The first Friday of every December&#151;in this case, the third day of the 
month&#151;was the day of the Winter Social, a sort of casual dance near the 
end of the semester for all participating school groups. Not only would 
the girls from Stanton be there, but many others from the surrounding 
districts. It would sort of be like Prom, only not nearly as formal, and 
would include things like a live band, food (of course), and even a few 
brief games and contests. Most everyone was coming, unless something 
dire kept them from participating, such as a job or sharp lack of 
finances.

A twisted ankle kept Blake Baum away from the fun, and being grounded 
had forced Mira van Dijk to stay home, so Usha was all by herself. The 
flock of girls she paraded around with were all spread out, dancing or 
talking idly, leaving her to her own devices. She had slowly been fazed 
out of the group since word got out that she was a lesbian, and things 
only got worse when she had the gall to acquire two girlfriends. She 
tried not showing how depressed and lonely she was as she made her way 
around the room, searching for a familiar or friendly face.

Erica and Jocelyn came in fashionably late, one bearing a more 
noticeable girth. McKeough&#39;s baby was due in April; her pregnancy would 
be in full bloom come the new year. She looked happy and carefree, 
though, and rather adorable with the shy Fox sister supporting her. 
Alisha had driven them in exchange for a date; Erica had miraculously 
found a young woman desperate enough to take her wild sister on. A 
gambling pool had already started over how long the two would stay 
together (both Erica and Jocelyn had wagered &quot;just this one night&quot;).

Ana and Rai, who were taking a break from slow dancing, wandered around 
together to socialize. They had each worn something nice but not too 
flashy: Rai actually opted for a dress, but still looked masculine in 
spite of it. They found Alexandra Blair and Corona Marcos chatting 
happily off in a secluded corner and joined them.

&quot;Hey, you two! How&#39;re things going?&quot;

&quot;Pretty good, pretty good. You two on good terms now?&quot;

&quot;Yup, couldn&#39;t be better!&quot;

&quot;Rai, any words?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happy,&quot; she said with a smile. Ana pointed at the two.

&quot;So tell me, I&#39;ve been observing you two in art class for like a month, 
and I think I saw you getting real close around that big protest, if ya 
know what I mean. So are you two, like, together or something?&quot;

&quot;You mean like...tonight or...?&quot;

&quot;Well...together.&quot; The two girls looked at each other.

&quot;Um, I guess. I know we&#39;re definitely together tonight.&quot;

&quot;So like you&#39;re dating?&quot; They shrugged.

&quot;I guess.&quot;

&quot;Awright, sweet! I thought so! I was hoping you two&#39;d get together!&quot;

&quot;Hey, we didn&#39;t say anything,&quot; said Blair wryly. She grinned and took 
Corona&#39;s arm, wrapping it around her body. Marcos winked and waved 
farewell; the two went off to dance or kiss or screw or smoke; Ana 
didn&#39;t see them. She turned to Rai and gave a crooked smile.

&quot;I think they make a really beautiful couple.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so now you&#39;re an advocate of lesbian relationships? I thought you 
were only interested in men and boyish girls like me.&quot;

&quot;Well, um...&quot; Ana grinned, stammered, blushed, &quot;Uh, ya see, well...&quot;

&quot;Come on.&quot; Rai smiled and picked Ana back up in her arms, leading her to 
the dance floor. &quot;I&#39;ve embarrassed you long enough. I&#39;ll just be content 
if you say you&#39;re in love with me.&quot;

&quot;You know I am.&quot; Rai whispered gently in her ear.

&quot;I wanna hear you say it.&quot; Ana nearly melted.

&quot;I&#39;m in love with you, Raisa.&quot; Zanders licked Ana&#39;s ear.

&quot;God,&quot; she purred, &quot;I love it when you use my full name.&quot; Ana laughed 
giddily and felt her body grow warmer from the attention her girlfriend 
was giving it. Her girlfriend. What an unlikely concept. Rai was 100 
female, initial appearances aside, and not only was she okay with that, 
she actually liked it. Ana had been nervous over the &quot;gay vibes&quot; she had 
gotten when she was first around Zanders, but any long amount of time 
spent with anybody, and affections would doubtless grow. Besides, 
underneath that cool exterior, Rai was a sweet creampuff&#151;a dork, even, 
but a loveable one&#151;and that&#39;s what made Ana&#39;s affections so strong.

Bernadette Marbel watched the young crowd have fun and let out her fifth 
sigh of loneliness that evening. It wasn&#39;t the absence of her darling 
Sapphire that plagued her&#151;after forty years of love and friendship, a 
bit of time apart did the couple well&#151;it was the loneliness of having 
someone, yet being unable to express it publicly. Marbel loved her wife 
quietly and compassionately, yet neither were in a good position to 
reveal their relationship. If word got out that the Headmistress was a 
lesbian, and had been married to a woman for quite some time... Or 
vice-versa, if Sapphire herself had her secret revealed...

Small wonder she was depressed. It was as if she knew the cure to 
cancer, but was forced to keep it a secret. Only the closest and most 
trustworthy teachers knew about the couple, which was not very many. 
Marbel wanted to take center stage and bare her soul; she wanted so 
badly to dance with Joanna in public, just once. Hang their shared sexes 
and their late middle age, she wanted people to know and she wasn&#39;t 
afraid. But their jobs, oh their jobs, they would both be lost and 
decades of work would be for naught!

&quot;You don&#39;t look like you&#39;re having a good time,&quot; said a kind voice next 
to her. Deep in thought and sadness, Bernadette had not noticed her 
guest. She turned around and smiled, noticing the young head chef of the 
school smiling at her. In spite of Chef Verela&#39;s height, she hardly 
intimidated anyone since she was so meek and awkward around everyone 
(versus Doc Andrews, who used her height to her advantage). Marbel 
welcomed her and tried cheering up.

&quot;I&#39;m just thinking.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Do you want to be alone?&quot;

&quot;No, dear, I&#39;m alone enough as it is. Would you mind keeping me 
company?&quot; Verela smiled meekly. Of course she would; she wanted little 
more. And who could blame her for seeking the Headmistress&#39; company? Who 
else deserved more respect, more admiration, more&#151;dare she hope&#151;love? 
She stood next to the older woman, wrung her hands out of habit, and 
observed the girls and their good times.

&quot;There are so many lives and stories out there,&quot; she mused. &quot;Sometimes 
it boggles me how much development, time, energy, and thought can go 
into the life of a single person. It&#39;s like there are a hundred novels 
out there, each one different, both in style and length. Each one is far 
more complex than any writer can make it out to be; a single life could 
take a whole library to tell. And yet they&#39;re all here, in this one 
combined story: one novel meeting another novel, each one anxiously 
turning the pages, afraid to go forward and sometimes, afraid to stay.&quot; 
Not apologizing for rambling, she looked to Marbel for a reaction. The 
Headmistress raised her eyebrows.

&quot;What a perception.&quot;

&quot;One thinks many thoughts in the kitchen. The mind wanders even at the 
pinnacle of focus. Miss Marbel, may I ask you a daring question, now 
that I have your attention and we know each other a little better now?&quot;

&quot;Well, I can hardly say that, but go on.&quot;

&quot;You at least know my perception a bit.&quot; Marbel nodded; Sonia asked her 
question, though with considerable bashfulness. &quot;Would you...be 
completely against...the idea of sharing a dance...with someone here?&quot;

&quot;Well, no, but it&#39;d have to be a brief one. I&#39;m afraid I must chaperone 
these girls. We don&#39;t want the Homecoming incident to repeat itself.&quot; 
Sonia agreed mutely, but she had the feeling that things would be more 
peaceful.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you have anything to worry over. I thought I saw those 
two girls, Kula and Ush&#151;excuse me, Miss Nanahara and Miss Krishnan 
engaged in peaceful conversation.&quot;

&quot;What, those two?&quot;

&quot;I recognized them. They seemed to be talking normally, no strife 
involved.&quot; Marbel let out an amazed &quot;Huh&quot;, crossed her arms, and scanned 
the dance floor for the two supposed enemies. She spotted them over by 
the punch bowl, talking as Sonia had described. She chewed her lip.

&quot;I hope that girl can restrain herself. I don&#39;t want any more 
festivities ruined.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Usha I&#39;m worried about,&quot; muttered Sonia. &quot;From what I gathered, 
Kula can control herself if the situation&#39;s right, but all Miss Krishnan 
has to do is say something offensive and everything&#39;s ruined. Tsk...a 
sensitive person shouldn&#39;t be around either one of them.&quot; She clucked 
her tongue, crossed her arms, and turned to Marbel again. &quot;Miss,&quot; she 
said tentatively, &quot;about my question: might I have the honor of being 
the only person you share a dance with? I mean, of course, if you&#39;re 
against it, I&#39;ll just return to the sandwiches and see to it they&#39;re 
replenished.&quot; Marbel shook her head and smiled at the younger woman. 
Sonia was offering to pull them both away from their jobs so they could 
attempt to have some fun, and since it would only be one harmless dance, 
Bernadette reasoned, why not?

&quot;No, I think we both need a break. I would love to&#151;and you can call me 
Bernie, Sonia. I was never a...very formal person in private.&quot;

That&#39;s understating things.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Kula waved as peacefully as she could when she approached Usha. 
She didn&#39;t want to send the wrong message&#151;she wasn&#39;t in a violent mood 
that evening. &quot;Where are your girlfriends?&quot;

&quot;Oh...Blake twisted her ankle, in a football game we played on her 
birthday. You know, during the holiday.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot;

&quot;And Mira&#39;s home, grounded, because of some bad grades she was getting.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. You aren&#39;t helping her?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m not going to help her until she learns to help herself.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a good way to look at things.&quot; Kula grinned and stepped a little 
closer. Usha darted to the side to give someone access to the punch bowl 
she had been hovering around and folded her hands neatly. Talking with 
Kula was as difficult and awkward as walking on thin ice. Her diplomacy 
skills would be tested to their limits for sure.

&quot;So how are you? Do you have a date?&quot;

&quot;Nah, I couldn&#39;t find any guys with enough balls, and I haven&#39;t seen a 
girl here who&#39;s interesting enough.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re...bisexual?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that a problem?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; she smiled. &quot;Actually, there&#39;s this group that meets 
after school, a support group, that caters to gay, straight, and 
bisexual people. I&#39;m sort of the residing leader over it.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So I&#39;m not invited.&quot;

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t say that; I&#39;m just wondering if it&#39;s something you&#39;d be 
interested in.&quot; The Hawaiian native shrugged indifferently.

&quot;Uh, maybe. Hey, uh, I know it&#39;s late, but I wanna apologize again for 
what I did. I was just pissed off, at my breakin&#39; point, ya know? I got 
a whole lotta nonsense goin&#39; on in my life, and the last thing I needed 
at the time was some goody-good makin&#39; me feel worse. I&#39;m real sorry.&quot;

&quot;Apology accepted,&quot; she said formally. &quot;I forgive you.&quot;

&quot;Yeh... You know, it was tough on me. I had to leave the greatest place 
in the world to rot in this hell-hole, and for what, so my parents could 
have more money? I got uprooted, lost all my friends, I don&#39;t know 
anyone here or even where here is... I just got a lotta crap on my 
shoulders, and I guess I unloaded on you. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; The poor girl 
looked close to tears there for a second, and Usha began to understand 
her a little. She smiled bashfully.

&quot;Well, I also have to apologize. For...what was it you called me? A 
pompous asshole? Well, I have to apologize for that.&quot;

&quot;I dunno if those were the words I used, but...okay.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just that, I have a lot of ideas and a lot of opinions, and I feel 
that if I don&#39;t express those, I&#39;m just wasting my time.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I ain&#39;t got nothin&#39; against opinions, just those people who think 
they&#39;re better. And you sure were sounding that way for a long time. 
Hopefully I knocked some sense into ya.&quot; She grinned and took a false 
swing, meant for a jest, but all it did was unsettle Usha more.

&quot;Um...I think it would&#39;ve been more affective for you to use your words, 
not your fists.&quot;

&quot;Hey, lord knows I tried. People like you sometimes gotta be shown a 
little bit of violence. You don&#39;t listen.&quot;

&quot;But violence isn&#39;t the ans&#151;&quot;

&quot;The answer, I know. But if I tried talking, you&#39;d just work your way 
around me and continue to blab about how right you are and how wrong 
everyone else is. You wouldn&#39;t listen.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m different now,&quot; she blurted&#151;but she had to really consider if what 
she said was true. She took a breath and added humbly, &quot;Or...I&#39;m trying. 
I&#39;m trying very hard. Yes you&#39;re right, I&#39;ve been pompous and selfish, 
and maybe even a little too self-righteous. I can&#39;t be a very affective 
diplomat if all I do is try and make people see things my way. You&#39;re 
right; I shouldn&#39;t be like that. But you know, seven years of doing that 
is hard to break.&quot;

&quot;Well...maybe I should keep tabs on you.&quot; Usha nodded.

&quot;Perhaps. You know, Kula, in a strange way, you&#39;ve been more of a friend 
than most of my real friends have. At least you&#39;re not shy about telling 
me what&#39;s wrong and how I should fix it. Some of them can only say Yes, 
you&#39;re right, and one can tire of that.&quot;

&quot;So just drop those assholes and think for yourself&#151;oops, maybe you 
shouldn&#39;t do that either.&quot; She chuckled and elbowed Usha knowingly; 
finally gleaning a laugh from the older girl.

&quot;It would be hard of me to abandon friends...but then again, my own 
actions, with Blake and Mira, are pretty much doing the job for me. Soon 
I&#39;ll have isolated myself from them. Being attracted to women, or two 
women, isn&#39;t exactly a wise career move, but I can&#39;t help it.&quot;

&quot;How sweet.&quot; Kula crossed her arms, bored, and looked over to where 
everyone was dancing and having a good time. She motioned to the crowd, 
and grinned. &quot;Hey, wanna dance? I&#39;ve won prizes before; I&#39;m really good. 
You may be a pompous asshole, Krishnan, but I bet you can glide like 
butter.&quot;

&quot;Umm...&quot; She blushed and found herself dragged onto the floor. Kula took 
her in a dance pose and began, and true enough, she performed well 
enough for the both of them. Usha lost her mind on that floor, and was 
glad for it.

&quot;See?&quot; said Sonia to Bernadette, motioning to the two girls. &quot;They&#39;re 
doing fine. What did I say?&quot;

&quot;I thought you had the same doubts like me.&quot;

&quot;But I did say they wouldn&#39;t start anything disastrous.&quot;

&quot;The same doubts, Sonia.&quot; Verela grinned shyly, and laughed just a 
little.

&quot;Well, they&#39;re doing fine now. Hopefully they can behave themselves in 
the future. And at least the other usual suspects are doing well.&quot; 
Marbel nodded, admitting that Sonia was right. Ivory Tran, a common face 
in the detention room, had barely squealed since arriving with her 
troupe, and the once-Furious Hail seemed at peace. Alexis Walker wasn&#39;t 
even present, and although Zane Klein was engaged in a fierce smack-talk 
session with her rival Petra, it didn&#39;t look like things would escalate. 
It seemed the Winter Social would go without a hitch.

Then Marbel noticed it, what she had speculated on for months, perhaps 
years. A lot of the teachers had female companions with them, and a lot 
of them were dancing together&#151;rather intimately, at that. Madsen and 
Keeping didn&#39;t even bother to hide their relationship. McGowen and 
Raulson held hands like lovers. Johansson and Dr. Andrews were clearly 
showing signs of affection, however uncertain. Cerio had an older 
girlfriend; Keys and Post looked like they were together; even Leena 
looked to be overly-familiar with a woman, and a student no less! Marbel 
wanted to squeal in shock.

&quot;What?&quot; said Sonia, noticing the change in the older woman&#39;s face. &quot;What 
is it? You&#39;re looking around a lot. You&#39;re really vigilant, you know. 
Relax, Miss Marb&#151;excuse me, Bernie. Relax.&quot; She grinned sweetly and 
dared to put her hands on the Headmistress in a familiar way. Marbel 
felt tingly from the touch, something that she honestly had not felt in 
years. She felt warm. She felt nervous, even, but it was just a dance, 
and Sonia was being polite. Or were those enchanting green eyes really 
sparkling for her?

&quot;I&#39;ve just...noticed some things that never occurred to me before,&quot; she 
answered shakily. Sonia nodded.

&quot;Oh. You certainly are observant and thoughtful. Traits I like.&quot; 
Bernadette blinked, staring at Sonia in wonder. Okay, the woman is 
clearly infatuated with me and has decided to test the waters. I ought 
to tell her I&#39;m married, and to a woman no less. Of course, if that&#39;s 
the case, I may as well blurt it to the whole state while I&#39;m at it.

Instead, she said, &quot;I am glad I possess a few things of value.&quot;

&quot;No, many things.&quot; Their eyes met and fastened like links of a chain. 
Sonia crept closer. Marbel felt suffocated. She swallowed. The song 
ended.

&quot;My time is up,&quot; she said weakly. &quot;I must return to my post, and you 
yours. Pity we couldn&#39;t continue this.&quot; Oh, and did I say that out loud? 
Well, she is grinning, so I suppose I did. Bad idea, Bernie&#151;you know 
better than this. You&#39;re married, for heaven&#39;s sake! And she&#39;s a 
teacher! And you&#39;re old enough to be her mother!

Marbel found herself smiling craftily when she was alone, though.

&quot;Could you imagine the scandal?&quot; she asked herself.

To her surprise, Usha found herself enjoying the time with Kula. Maybe 
it was the odd realization that a girl who had hated her more than a 
month ago was now dancing peacefully with her, and they had actually 
been getting along before then! Maybe it was just loneliness. Her life 
had been a steady progression of stress, chaos, and accomplishment, but 
her two girlfriends had shown her how to loosen up and be a human again. 
Their absence left a vacuum, and now it was being filled by a very 
unlikely person. Perhaps, though, she was enjoying herself because Kula 
was being so very gentle with her...

&quot;Ya havin&#39; fun, asshole?&quot; she asked, grinning merrily. Usha didn&#39;t like 
being called such vulgar names, but even she knew when the younger girl 
was teasing.

&quot;I do, though I could do without the profanity.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry. Yeah, you don&#39;t deserve it now. You&#39;ve definitely improved. 
But I still don&#39;t like ya very much.&quot;

&quot;Then why dance with me?&quot;

&quot;I dunno, cuz&#39; I&#39;m lonely? And there ain&#39;t nobody else who&#39;s got the 
guts to do this with me. Least I know you can be tough when you need 
to.&quot;

&quot;Oh. But on the other hand, I&#39;ve noticed, you can be gentle when you 
need to.&quot;

&quot;A quality I don&#39;t let out often, granted,&quot; she said casually. &quot;My last 
two familiar dates, boy and gel respectively, both blew their minds when 
they learned I was complex. One thought I was nasty, the other thought I 
was sweet. Exposure to the opposite sent them packing. Least you know I 
got both. Does that bother you?&quot;

&quot;I think complexity is a necessity,&quot; she replied. &quot;Besides, after 
spending a few minutes with Miss Kogure, you seem almost normal.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; Kula laughed out loud, knowing exactly what her dance partner 
was talking about. Yuki had a tendency to be rather...schizophrenic at 
times.

And they danced the night away, they all danced the night away...

Bernadette Marbel volunteered to drive Sonia home, since her ride had 
become rather occupied with other forces. Usha Krishnan took Kula home, 
not wanting the poor girl to skate her way to her front yard, especially 
in the early December weather. There was a stiff silence in both cars, 
although it was not uncomfortable or unpleasant. Marbel felt she had 
connected with somebody special. Usha felt she and Kula had finally come 
to terms with each other, or were starting to anyway. They each groaned 
as they passed Christmas decorations set up well before their time. They 
all breathed uneasily, feeling chilly and uncertain, like they had all 
passed dangerous borders.

I shouldn&#39;t have said such things to the Headmistress.

I shouldn&#39;t have been so intimate with Sonia.

What is going to become of my relationship with Kula now?

Will Usha think I&#39;m just a weirdo from here on out?

Sonia lived by herself. She asked Marbel to come in. Bernie accepted.

&quot;Ya wanna nightcap before ya turn in?&quot; asked Kula. Usha nodded her head.

Marbel dropped her guard and watched Sonia illuminate her house. She 
orchestrated the kitchen to fix a snack and a drink for both of them, 
but was also able to pay attention to her guest as they chatted. Marbel 
opened up by complimenting the house, then Verela&#39;s cooking skills. 
Sonia smiled bashfully and took the praise like a true pro, then 
presented the dish for her guest. Marbel took the half-sandwich and the 
alcohol with a nod of thanks.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you like, so forgive me if it&#39;s not to your taste,&quot; 
warned the younger woman. Bernadette nibbled the sandwich and sipped the 
drink carefully, and found the two tastes complimented each other well. 
They were fair alone, but probably meant to be best enjoyed as a pair.

&quot;Good,&quot; she smiled. Sonia&#39;s grin clearly showed how pleased she was. 
Marbel kept watch on the younger woman as she sat and undressed a 
little&#151;enough, but not too much. She kicked off her own shoes and joined 
Verela on her loveseat.

I shouldn&#39;t be doing this, reasoned the older woman, having a deeper 
drought.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;cha like,&quot; said Kula as she handed Usha her drink, 
&quot;so forgive me if ya don&#39;t like it. I&#39;m not supposed to have beer, so... 
Oh, and that don&#39;t have any caffeine in it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; So Kula understood how sodas conflicted with late hours. 
She wouldn&#39;t force Usha to stay awake by giving her a sugary drink. It 
was hot green tea mixed with milk, so Krishnan would definitely want to 
be in bed when she arrived home. She smiled and thanked Kula.

&quot;You definitely have more dimensions than I thought,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I 
have to admit, you seemed brutish despite your appearance for a long 
time. Then I see why a lot of people would think you&#39;re, emm, cute. 
You&#39;ve got quite a kind nature.&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t tell anyone,&quot; said the girl playfully. Usha whispered out a 
laugh and promised to keep the secret. She put down the tea and observed 
Kula approaching her. It was very sudden. Their eyes met. Tensions 
coiled. They touched. Usha felt herself being kissed, on her lips, by a 
girl who had beaten her not that long ago. Her eyes flared open in 
surprise before they slowly closed in alien pleasure.

Marbel&#39;s fingers lightly grazed Sonia&#39;s hand, and became inflamed when 
they rose to her face. She heard warnings go off and ignored them; she 
could feel Sonia&#39;s pulse skyrocket as she touched her gently, gently, 
with such gentle care. The woman&#39;s chest was visibly pitter-patting from 
the nervous dance of her heart. She hissed and gave in as Bernadette 
kissed her fully, deeply, passionately. They accepted each other&#39;s 
embrace and fell into the loveseat, knowing nothing save the feel of 
each other&#39;s silky lips.

Joanna Sapphire Langston-Marbel, said the woman&#39;s conscience, but the 
love of her life was gone while this sweet siren was succumbing to her 
caress. Sonia was needy but never greedy; she cherished each kiss and 
every touch as if it were the first, or the last. She was a silent one, 
too, never moaning or panting like certain pornographic heroines&#151;she 
simply kissed, and breathed, and gently smiled or laughed in pleasure. 
Then she removed her outer shirt.

Usha felt Kula&#39;s tongue slide through her lips, and she welcomed it 
hungrily.

Marbel grabbed Sonia and pulled her close, feeling the girl&#39;s 
unimpressive brassiere and naked skin against her clothes.

Usha pulled back, shocked at what she had just done. Faintly, she 
remembered from some long-forgotten life, there had been two other women 
who loved her, who really loved her.

Marbel sat up and stopped. Sonia could tell she had went too far.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t.&quot;

They each left the individual houses, never aware that a similar 
scenario was playing out elsewhere.

Kula and Sonia were left alone and cold.

They were all gonna carry that weight a long time.</pre>
