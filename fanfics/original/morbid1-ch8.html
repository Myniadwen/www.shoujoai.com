The clouds began to gather in intercity, drifted into town and spiral 
above the rooftops, as the patrons of The Raven&#39;s Keep murmured to each 
other over their drinks. The winds outside began to pick up to a furious 
pace, rattling the window shutters and causing the awning to flutter 
about wildly. 

Charles cautiously approached one of the windows and peered outside, 
&quot;What a tremendous day this is turning out to be.&quot; He nervously took a 
sip of his new martini, &quot;I wonder if Samuel is still out there trying to 
paint the trees?&quot; He muttered dryly, &quot;How that man can paint with a stub 
for hands is beyond me.&quot; He stated turning his back to the window. 

&quot;That is not very nice.&quot; Elizabeth gave the actor a hostile scowl, 
&quot;Samuel is a very good painter. You should not put him down for his...&quot; 
She paused trying to find a polite way to describe their friend&#39;s 
uniqueness. 

&quot;Disfigured appearance?&quot; Charles concluded her statement, yet again 
sipping his drink, &quot;I was not putting the man down. I was just stating 
how amazing well that man can work. I would have quiet after losing the 
right eye, but not our Samuel. Nor did he when that circus tiger took 
both his hands.  Knowing the man he probably will not come in until the 
rain start to run his colours again.&quot; He shook his head in stupefied 
amazement. 

The air abruptly filled with the sounds of barking dogs and the door 
hastily burst open. Samuel rushing into the caf&eacute;, slamming the door shut 
behind him and pushed a chair up against it. He had a wild look to his 
eyes and was panting heavily as he stared at the door in fearfulness. 

&quot;Why Samuel! We were just talking about you!&quot; Elizabeth chimed, getting 
up to give the man a hug when she noticed the tattered condition of his 
clothes and stopped in mid step, &quot;What happened to you?&quot; She asked 
aghast at the sight of her friend as she rushed to the man&#39;s side, &quot;Your 
back... it is all cut up.&quot; She noted walking around the man in stunned 
bewilderment. 

The sound of the barking grew ever so louder and the door began to 
rattle as the sounds of claws could be heard scratching against the 
wooden surface, &quot;Poodles.&quot; Samuel mumbled as he backed away from the 
door with fear filling his one good eye, &quot;Tens of circus poodles... all 
trying to eat me...&quot; His eye widened as something banged at the door at 
deafening rate and with such force that it shook at its hinges. 

&quot;Poodles?&quot; Charles said with a chuckle, &quot;You have to be joking dear 
man.&quot; He turned to look out the window to see what he could see, &quot;Why 
would poodles want to eat y-&quot; The window was suddenly smashed open as a 
large furry arm reached in and grabbed Charles around the neck. His 
terrified screams filled the room as a ferocious black bear started to 
pull Charles through the window. 

&quot;No - You - Do - Not!&quot; Elizabeth grabbed the actor by the legs and begun 
a vicious game of tug-a-war with the bear over a broken window. Shards 
of glass gauging large slash marks across Charles&#39;s chest and poured 
blood down the wall. Many of the patrons screamed in panic and tried to 
flee to the back of the caf&eacute; when a swirling green light appeared on the 
ceiling creating a large vortex of green luminosity and darkness. One by 
one the people found themselves becoming mesmerized by the patterns of 
light and drew closer to it. 

*****

Jamie cowered in the corner of her room. She realized too late that 
something had gone horribly wrong. She had not cast a spell to return 
her lover; she had opened a door to death itself. A pit of light and 
darkness had appeared twisting in the centre of her room. A long dark 
green translucent tentacle arose from the edge of the hole and slithered 
towards her, followed by several others. She was too frightened to 
scream so just curled up in her corner where she was trembling in dread 
as the tendrils of terror came closer. One touched her foot and she 
pulled it back, trying hard to pull herself into the cracks in her 
bedroom walls. 

Quickly, a tentacle took her by the ankle, pulled her off the ground and 
hung her upside down. The others rose up on all sides of the girl and 
eyeballs floated to it surface to stare upon her, almost as if they were 
looking her over with strange curiosity. Jamie gave one of the tentacles 
a wry smile and wave. The creature seemed provoked by this movement and 
attacked the girl, tickling her relentlessly under the arms pits, 
causing her to squeal out in laughter.

*****

&quot;I said let. Him! Go!!!&quot; Elizabeth growled in rage. She gave one final 
mighty heave and pulled Charles free of the bear&#39;s grasp, causing the 
two of them to tumble to the ground. The bear was about to continue 
after its prey when it noticed the vortex on the ceiling and started to 
back away. It turned and ran off down the road with the poodles close 
behind it. Elizabeth rolled out from under the actor&#39;s body, &quot;Charles? 
Charles are you all right?&quot; She turned the man over to find the bear&#39;s 
claws had horribly mauled his chest and glass fragments from of the 
window jutted out of the gaping wound. She choked on her own vomit as 
she looked at the foot long slash marks that covered her friend&#39;s upper 
torso exposing his ribs, even his throat had been torn open, &quot;It is not 
fair.&quot; Elizabeth cried collapsing next to the actor pounding at the 
floor in frustration, &quot;It is just not fair.&quot;

Samuel tentatively approached the woman, &quot;Beth, we need to get out of 
here.&quot; He said anxiously, while he trying to avert his eyes from the 
corpse of his friend, &quot;We must flee before we join Charles.&quot; 

&quot;How could you just leave him?&quot; Elizabeth wailed as she reached out to 
touch Charles&#39;s pale blood splattered cheeks, &quot;He was a good man. 
Probably the only man that I really loved, for he was family and you 
just want to leave him here?&quot; She turned her angry eyes on the painter.

&quot;That is not what I mean.&quot; Samuel nervously peered over his shoulder at 
the spiralling hole above them and then to the growing number of people 
being drawn in by the light, &quot;I&#39;m just terrified of what might come 
through that thing if we don&#39;t hurry.&quot; He gingerly looped his hook hand 
around her arm and cautiously started to pull her to her feet.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not leaving.&quot; Beth stubbornly stated as she tore her arm out 
of Samuel grasp and plopping lifelessly back down to the floor, 
&quot;Besides, we can&#39;t leave without Jamie. She went to her room a moment 
ago. She will be even more alone then she already is if we just run off 
without her.&quot;

&quot;Fine then.&quot; Samuel uttered, shaking his head in doubt that the young 
lady was still alive, &quot;We will first find Jamie and then we can get out 
of here.&quot; He helped Beth to her feet again and the two started to skirt 
around the edge of the caf&eacute;, trying hard to avert their eyes from the 
swirling lights. Samuel made the mistake of looking into the vortex just 
as a mass of a green tar-like substance began to emerge forming a 
massive blob hanging from the ceiling that took up a large portion of 
the room. Many glowing eyes filled the blob and floated to its surface. 
A couple of eyes caught Samuel&#39;s gaze and they all rushed to one side to 
stare down upon the man with intense interest. He became petrified with 
fear as he found himself staring into the eyes of such a terrifying 
creature. Finding Samuel&#39;s fear filled eyes of no interest the creature 
turned all hundred or so of its eyes to look upon Charles&#39;s corpse. It 
reached out one of its tentacles and touched the man&#39;s forehead. Slowly, 
Charles&#39;s eyes began to open and he sat upright. 

&quot;Oh my... what happened to me?&quot; He asked in a daze, rubbing his head, &quot;I 
have got to stay away from those martinis&quot; He muttered shaking the fog 
from his head then looking down at his blood soaked body, &quot;What happened 
to my tux!?! This was the most expensive suit I could afford in all of 
Paris.&quot; He exclaimed as he tried to wipe some of the blood of the front 
of the suit, not seeming to notices his ribs where showing through the 
ribbons of cloth, then he reached up to touch his neck and his fingers 
sunk into the opening, &quot;Where is my tie!?!&quot; He exclaimed in shock. 
Quickly he started to search the ground for his tie, oblivious to the 
monstrous creature that hovered behind him. 

&quot;Charles!!!&quot; Beth cried out, delighted to see your friend moving again, 
&quot;Charles, your alive!!!&quot; She left Samuel&#39;s side in an attempt to reach 
her friend. The creature&#39;s eye&#39;s suddenly reeled around to face the 
woman, yet she seemed ignorant of the fact that the creature was paying 
any attention to her. Samuel suddenly snapped free of his terror and 
sprung towards the woman. He planted the stub of his hand against Beth&#39;s 
back and pushed her to the ground. At that very moment a large tentacle, 
the thickness of a tree trunk, shot out from the middle of the monster&#39;s 
body, it hit the patchwork artist squarely in the chest and crushing him 
against the shelving behind the caf&eacute; bar, sending bottles of alcohol 
crashing down from their spots on the shelf. Crimson spat forth from his 
open mouth, as ever one of his ribs was simultaneously broke under the 
force of the blow, puncturing both of his lungs, instantly killing the 
man. 

Victoria watched in horror from her hiding spot under the bar as the 
creature released Samuel, letting his lifeless body fall to the 
glass-covered floor in a heap. It then swung the grotesquely large limb 
covered with glowing eyes at the other frightened patrons knocking them 
around like a kitten playing with defenceless mice.

****

Jamie grabbed one of the tentacles in her hand sinking her teeth into 
the fowl thing. It let out an ear piercingly shrill wail and released 
its grasp on the girl. Freed from the terrible wrath of the tentacles 
she fell to the ground in a heap. Quickly she sprung to her feet, 
fumbled with the latch on the door, flung it open the door and fled down 
the hall. The tentacles swiftly noticed their pry has escaped and 
regained their composure to make chase. Jamie took a quick peek behind 
her to see that they were indeed gaining on her. She quickened her pace 
in hopes to avoid another round of tickling. She turned to face forwards 
again to found herself at the end of the hall and about to crash into a 
very large window. She had no time to stop herself as she collided with 
the window, sending shards of glass twinkling to the street below 
followed closely by her own body, hitting the ground with a sickening 
thud. 

She tried to move only to find that her right arm was twisted in an 
unnatural position, one of her legs was broken in several places and the 
other badly sprained at the very least. Just then there was a crash as 
the blob creature tossed yet another body through the front door. She 
turned her head to see a carriage coming down the road. The driver madly 
steered the horses to avoided the flying body only to come trampling 
towards our poor writer. She didn&#39;t even have time to conceive what was 
about to happen to her as the driver unknowingly rolled over the girl, 
the wheels of the carriage severing her head from her body at the neck 
ending the tragic writer&#39;s life of suffering.
