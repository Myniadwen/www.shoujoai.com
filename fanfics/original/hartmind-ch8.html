<h1>In My Heart and In My Mind (part 8 of 28)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Star awoke the next morning with the rising of the sun, which 
immediately told her that it was somewhere around six in the morning. A 
glace at the black hands of a silver alarm clock next to her bed that 
affirmed her assumption and gave her the more accurate time of 
six-thirty. 

With a leisurely stretch she pulled off the blankets and swung her feet 
over the edge of the bed, which was still too big for her and she found 
her feet floated a good few centimetres off the ground when she sat upon 
its edge. Carefully she reached a foot down to pick up a soft purple 
slipper with the tip of her toe and place it on her foot before 
retrieving the other in a similar manner. Before considering getting out 
of bed she took a deep breath and searched internally for any signs of 
Samantha. To her relief she could still feel the girl&#39;s presence near 
her. Sam was deep asleep, lost within some kind of dream. A sensation of 
restlessness and mild sense of tension coming from the girl and she 
figured that Sam must be having a nightmare of sorts. For a brief second 
she considered closing her eyes to find out if she could see Sam&#39;s 
dreams but quickly vanquished the thought, not wanting to intrude upon 
the girl&#39;s inner thoughts. It was one thing to be linked emotionally, 
but it would be another to walk through someone&#39;s dreams. She decided 
that if Sam&#39;s emotions became more agitated to the point of fear or 
despair she would wake her up, but until they she would allow Sam to 
sleep and surprise her with a visit. 

Quickly she hopped out of her bed, careful not to make a sound, not 
wanting to awaken her mother. Although it was Sunday she intended to 
allow her mother to sleep a little longer. Her mother worked long nights 
to support them and usually did not get up until mid afternoon, about 
the time that Star would be arriving home from school, so Star had 
learned to quietly go about her morning routine without disturbing her 
mother. Seeing as today was her birthday she also knew that her mom 
would have something planned for later in the evening, a special 
mother/daughter time with a few movies and maybe some pizza, so she was 
content with having a quiet morning alone.

In a silent haste she moved about her room, searching for what to wear 
for her morning journey. She was sure visiting hours did not start for 
some time yet, but that gave her time to find Samantha&#39;s room and maybe 
even visit the gift shop for a moment to get her something small. She 
then recalled that they both shared the same birth date and her mind 
filled with many anxious worries. She knew very little about the girl 
and yet she wanted to get her the perfect gift. She chewed on her lower 
lip as she stared at the many dresses in her closet and contemplated 
what to wear. Her heart raced as she picked through the many outfits. 
She tried to calm it down, reminding herself that Sam already had a 
girlfriend, but that did not seem the help matters much. The fact that 
Sam did in fact have an interest in girls meant that there was a slim 
chance for her to get close to the girl. Sam had already said that she 
had not yet confessed her feelings to the girl she loves so there was 
still a chance. 

She halted abruptly, her hand upon a black dress with lace trim. What 
had she been thinking? Was she actually considering stealing Sam&#39;s heart 
before it could be given away? A wave of guilt circled in the pit of her 
stomach and she suddenly felt miserable. Was she this desperately 
lonely? This was not like her at all, she should be glad to just have a 
friend so what was wrong with her? She nodded firmly to herself, she 
would settle with just being friends, after all no one really knew what 
the future would bring for them, not even her psychic powers could tell 
her that. At this moment Samantha was in need of a kind shoulder and not 
more complications. Star decided it would be best to lock her own 
feelings away for now and wait to see what happens in the weeks ahead. 
For all she knew Samantha would find her weird and not wish to have 
anything to do with her after the days end. This thought made Star feel 
all the more miserable and she nervously tucked her long black hair 
behind her ear, causing her to catch a glimpse of herself in the mirror 
over her dresser. 

Her hair hung in long strains over her shoulders and around her face. 
The hair she had only recently tucked behind her ear had already fallen 
back in her face, obscuring her soft pale face from the world. Crystal 
blue eyes shone out from behind a veil of hair at her reflection and she 
hesitantly pushed her hair off to the side again, allowing half her face 
to be visible again. 

&#39;You are beautiful&#39; She heard Samantha&#39;s words ring out in her mind and 
they made her flush. Sam thought she was beautiful, all her life she had 
only heard those words from her mother. Her father, however, felt she 
was a monster, a demon child that should be vanquished from the world. 
She frowned at the thought of her father and shook the worries from her 
mind, he was long gone and she should not worry herself about him any 
longer. Today she was sixteen; she could get a learner&#39;s permit now and 
was legally able to live on her own, if she truly wanted too, which she 
didn&#39;t. She was a highschooler now and that meant a chance at a new life 
for her, or at least she hoped, and Samantha&#39;s appearance in her life 
proved it. She had to leave the past behind her and get on with her life 
and at this moment Sam needed her so she planned to be there for the 
girl, no matter what. 

With a new sense of belonging in the world Star pulled a long black 
dress from her closet and held it up to her body. The dress was fancier 
then her usually attire of plain dark skirts and t-shirts. The hem was 
ruffled with several rows of black lace along the trim. The sleeves were 
crafted of the same lace while the body was a shimmering silk that felt 
good against her skin. It was a dress her mother had bought her for her 
birthday last year and she had yet to find the right occasion to wear 
it, until now that is. It felt too pretty for her to wear and yet, on 
that day, she felt it was perfect. She carefully placed the dress across 
her bed and proceeded to pull off her nightgown then gather the rest of 
her clothes together, a pair of black nylons and a small black lace 
chocker with a tiny silver star sown on the middle, another gift from 
her mother. Then she turned to the few shoes that lay at the bottom of 
her closet and stopped. Among the shoes a pair of shiny leather Mary 
Jane&#39;s leapt to Star&#39;s attention. A cousin of her&#39;s had given her the 
Mary Jane&#39;s thinking that they would suit Star. Since then they stayed 
in the back of the closet, awaiting their chance to shine. She knelt 
down and pulled the shoes out from under a pair of runners and wiped off 
some of the dust that had built up upon their surface. The way the 
morning&#39;s sunlight shone off the shoes brought a smile to her face and 
she quickly began to get dressed, excited about the day ahead. 

Her hand touched the doorknob to her room and she abruptly stopped. She 
felt something watching her and she cautiously turned around to see whom 
it could be. Sitting upon her nightstand, staring at her with its big 
round eyes was her birthday gift. The strange toad that Samantha had 
mentioned also having. Something about the toy drew her across the room 
and she picked it up from the table. She could feel a dull tingling 
feeling in the tips of her fingers and a strange sensation fill her 
heart. Could this small toy really be her connection to Sam? She did not 
know, but part of her worried that if she left the toy behind she might 
loss that connection. Quickly she grabbed a small handbag off the closet 
knob and stuffed the creature inside before slinging the strap over her 
head and heading out the door.
