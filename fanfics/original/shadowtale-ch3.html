<h1>A Shadowlander's Tale: One's Purpose (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowtale-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Kai stood upon the rooftop, once again staring out upon the world below, 
&#145;What am I going to do?&#39; She pondered, &#145;How can I out run death? It is 
impossible.&#39;She fell backwards, grabbed onto the fence to keep her 
balance and looked up to see a black raven landed upon the top of the 
fence, &quot;Hey there birdy. Do you know how I can keep my promise with 
Anita?&quot; She asked the feathered creature. The raven looked down at Kai 
and when there eyes met Kai felt a familiar feeling drift through her 
mind. She cocked her head at the bird. There was something about it that 
she remember, &quot;Bre...nna...&quot; She muttered in a dazed stat as she found 
herself being drawn into the black eyes of the bird. 

&quot;Get Back Here!!!&quot; A voice yelled out causing the raven to abruptly look 
up and release its hold on Kai. Kai followed the bird&#39;s gaze to the far 
ends of the roof where she saw Mary roughly holding Ashley by the arm 
and pulling her closer. 

Kai shook her head as she pushed off the fence and began to stroll 
towards the disturbance. The raven took flight and landed gently upon 
Kai&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I was never into all this destiny stuff anyway.&quot; Kai 
told the bird as she reached up and scratched it on the side of the 
head, &quot;If I&#39;m going to die then it is going to be on my terms.&quot; The 
raven cawed in response, &quot;You will help me right, Poe?&quot; Again the raven 
cawed in response and Kai grinned maliciously. She could feel something 
boiling inside of her. She didn&#39;t understand what was coming over her 
but the sight of Mary wildly wrenching such a frail looking child around 
inflamed Kai to no end. She clenched her fist at her side as she 
approached the two girls, &quot;Afternoon girls,&quot; She greeted them with a sly 
grin, &quot;Nice day for a walk, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Mary turned to scowl at Kai, &quot;You are either very brave or very stupid.&quot; 
She affirmed coldly. 

&quot;Actually,&quot; Kai smiled at Poe, who in turn looked down at her then back 
at Mary and cawed. Kai faced Mary once again. This time there was an 
intensified glare,  &quot;I have a date with death and decided to let you 
come along for the ride.&quot; Her grin broadened and she could feel her 
canine&#39;s twitching and ached lightly. 

Mary pushed Ashley to the ground, &quot;If that is the case, then...&quot; She 
lifted her right hand to her face and the wrist suddenly wrenched 
backwards and twisted around on it&#39;s own. Bones cracked and joints 
snapped as her hand grew in length and shape. Fingers becoming long 
jagged claws and tiny spikes appeared along her arm. 

Kai simply grinned at the girl, &quot;I see now. Your just a Dream Ghoul. 
Trying to feed off a poor innocent frail girl.&quot; She shook her head in 
shame, &quot;And here I thought you were more then that. You are the lowest 
form of creature in this world.&quot; She proclaimed, snarling at Mary.

&quot;Why you little!&quot; Mary leapt at Kai with blood in her eyes. 

&quot;Poe.&quot; Kai nodded at Mary and the bird sprung from Kai&#39;s shoulder and 
flew at Mary. 

&quot;You think you can stop me with such a lame trick?&quot; Mary batted at the 
bird as it pecked and scratched at her. She didn&#39;t notice Kai rush at 
her from the side until she felt Kai&#39;s fist hit her hard in the face. 
Mary quickly turned and slashed at Kai. Two of her claws tore through 
Kai&#39;s shirt and pieced the soft flesh of the girl&#39;s stomach. 

Kai dropped to the ground clenching her wound as blood poured out on to 
the concrete. Kai lifted her hand to her face. It was red with blood. 
Her blood. She raised her head to see Poe swooping at Mary keeping her 
from ascending upon its wounded master. Kai&#39;s eyes became blurry and an 
image of Anita&#39;s sad face floated in front of her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kai 
mumbled reaching out for the image, &quot;I was foolish. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She was 
about to let death take her when a new more intense pain shot through 
her entire body. She screamed out in anguish as fire raced through her 
veins. She could feel the bones in her back and shoulder blades crack 
and shift. She clenched her eyes shut and curled up in a ball wishing 
nothing more then for the pain to stop. Tears rolled down her cheeks and 
dripped into the pool of blood below her. Kai opened her eyes to see 
drops of blackness swirling in a river of red. She focussed upon her 
refection in the blood to see black tears were streaming from her eyes 
as if she was wearing mascara. The tears began to flow together and form 
black tattoos around her eyes creating several curled triangles the 
spread out across her face. Suddenly another wave of pain rushed through 
her back and she could hear her shirt tearing. Kai placed her hands on 
the ground to steady herself and arched her back. She stared at the 
ground as a great shadow formed over her. 

Mary swatted at the bird to the ground. Satisfied that it wasn&#39;t going 
to continue its attack she turned to face Kai once again only to be 
surprised to see Kai raising to her feet. Three pairs of massive 
feathered wings spread out behind the girl blocking out the sun. Kai 
raised her right arm to shoulder leave and black ink started to run out 
from under her short sleeve. It spread across the girl&#39;s arm like wild 
fire created a flame like tattoo designs that wrapped around the girl&#39;s 
entire arm stopping at the back of her hand. Mary staggered back 
realizing that she was not facing any ordinary girl. Fear filled her 
eyes as Kai began to approach her. Kai clenched her fist and the tattoos 
leapt to life. Flames crawled across the girl&#39;s skin burning the hem of 
the sleeve but not flesh. Kai suddenly lunged at Mary.

Marie leapt up into the air just as Kai&#39;s hand brushed passed her hair. 
She landed on the corner of the chain link fence and crouched with her 
feet under her, knees to either side and elbows upon her thighs, &quot;I 
see.&quot; Marie stated with a grin, &quot;So that is where you were hiding. I 
thought at first you were this ashen girl.&quot; She nodded down towards 
Ashley, whom was now getting to her feet, &quot;I see I was mistaken. Now 
that you&#39;ve revealed yourself let us continue this hunt on another day.&quot; 
She stood to her full height and leaned backwards until she fell off the 
roof. 

&quot;WAIT!!!&quot; Kai ran to the fence in time to see the girl flip over in mid 
air and land gently upon her feet then casually walk away. 

&quot;What the hell was that all about?&quot; Kai exclaimed in astonishment. She 
looked down at the marking upon her hand. The flames had died down but 
the tattoos were clearly etched into her skin. &quot;What is going on 
here...?&quot; She turned her hand over in amazement of what she was seeing. 
She looked down to find that the wound upon her stomach had completely 
healed. She turned to Ashley who was smiling up at her. 

&quot;What is going on up there?&quot; Call a voice from the stair well. 

&quot;Crap!&quot; Kai searched around for a means of escape when she looked up at 
her wings. The sounds of people rushing up the stairs began to increase 
in numbers. Deciding there was no other choice Kai ran across the roof 
and jumped into the air. Her foot touched the top of the chain linked 
fence and she pushed off of it soaring high into the air. She looked 
down to see some teachers burst out onto the roof and run over the 
Ashley&#39;s side. Then she noticed Poe flutter into the air and land upon 
the stair well entrance where a short haired girl sat. She was dressed 
in a white dress shirt, v-neck sleeveless sweater, black neck tie and 
slacks. Poe jumped up on the girl&#39;s shoulder and she pet the animal 
before looking up at Kai and waved. 

&quot;Brenna?&quot; Kai muttered to her self. She felt she knew this girl and 
wanted to ask her questions, but seeing as the teachers were now looking 
up at her she decided it would be best to flee for now and figure things 
out later.
