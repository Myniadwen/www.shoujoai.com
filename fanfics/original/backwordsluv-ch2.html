<h1>Backwards Words for Love (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/silverferret.html">silverferretfox</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/backwordsluv-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	I was in a state of shock. Did she just truly say what I thought 
she did? I stood there staring at her, my mouth hanging open. She waited 
expectantly, but when I still didn&#39;t say anything, she started to 
fidget.
	&quot;Cenin?&quot; she asked. I still couldn&#39;t get my body to move, let 
alone say anything. For a few seconds, I began wondering if she meant 
that in the troll lingo, but then I remembered what she said before she 
said that... that she...
	Oh my god... Did she really say that? Maybe she misunderstood, or 
maybe I misunderstood. Maybe she didn&#39;t mean it as I thought she did. 
But what if she did?
	She shifted from foot to foot. I guess she took my silence as a 
human. She took it as rejection. Her beautiful green eyes started to 
tear up.
	&quot;You pox ridden, slime covered, dung smelling, detestable rat! You 
must find my presence grandly amusing! Since I feel the opposite, surely 
it is only logical for me to leave! You disgust me!&quot;
	I think I dropped my heart when she said that. I couldn&#39;t feel it 
beating in my chest anymore. My chest felt hollow, and burned. It felt 
like I was dying.
	&quot;Na&#39;... Na&#39;nal?&quot; She had been about to turn away when I called to 
her. And when I saw the tears streaming down her face, it suddenly 
clicked. She meant the second half as a troll. She loves me as a human, 
and hates me as a troll. &quot;You hate me like a troll.&quot;
	I couldn&#39;t stop the smile that slowly split my face. I saw her 
eyes widen as I smiled.
	&quot;You&#39;re as contemptible as a drowned dog filled with maggots, your 
bloated carcass an unsightly thing washed up on shore.&quot;
	My smile only grew bigger, even though I was still partially 
getting over the initial human reaction of heartbreak.
	&quot;And you are the most vile thing I have ever lay eyes upon. I 
would die before inviting you to join me as I travel as far away from 
here as I can. Your mucus colored skin and sulfur smelling breath 
sickens me. Your presence is an insult.&quot;
	&quot;Do you hate me... like a troll?&quot; she finally asked, her wide 
green eyes filled with a new spark.
	&quot;As you love me as a human.&quot; I replied. Her eyes lit up, and she 
bound over the shards and into my arms. I almost fell over, my knees 
still weak.
	My life, it seemed, was turning more into a fairytale then I ever 
thought it would. I never thought I would run into elves or fairies, or 
trolls for that matter. I never thought I would cross the invisible 
bounds of reason and venture into a new world. I never thought, and this 
one still really blows my mind away, that I would fall in love with an 
elf troll girl, let alone she would love me in return.
	... Come to think of it though, exchanging insults as a way of 
expressing ones love for another... Bah, that still throws me for a 
loop. But, when I finally figured out she meant she loved me as a human, 
I was dancing like a pro in my head. Yet, funny thing. AFTER all this 
initial happy, happy, joy, joy stuff... it registered that ... I had to 
figure out how to court... a troll. Heaven help me.
	How on earth! ... do you court a troll? Really now. I know they 
throw insults back and forth, but how would you honestly court a troll? 
Any thoughts? Ideas? Or have I really got it wrong and they don&#39;t 
actually court at all? Thirty seconds after my imaginative Lord of the 
Dance streak, I came crashing back to reality with two hundred pounds of 
questions and no one to give me answers. 
	Talk about a deer in the headlights. I was that darn deer twice in 
the span of five minutes. And, not only that, I still didn&#39;t know if 
Na&#39;nal would come with me or not. Oh, and if I could get the caravan 
agree to take her. But, as twisted as fate can get, Gren came over. The 
smirk on her face was kind of irking.
	&quot;Well, well, it seems things went better then I&#39;d hoped.&quot;
	I wasn&#39;t able to control the blush that stained my cheeks. Na&#39;nal 
however, grinned at her from ear to ear.
	&quot;Horrible. It went horrible.&quot;
	At least Gren had been around Na&#39;nal enough to know what she 
meant. She only smiled before turning her attention to me.
	&quot;We leave in six days. If you&#39;re still wanting to tag along, be 
ready by daybreak.&quot;
	Na&#39;nal turned to me in panic, her arms tightening around my neck.
	&quot;You&#39;re leaving?!&quot;
	&quot;Yes, my feet aren&#39;t ready to settle down yet. They still yearn 
for travel.&quot;
	&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?!&quot;
	&quot;I was going to. Actually,&quot; I think my blush returned. &quot;I was, uh, 
going to ask if you wanted to come with me. If you wanted to, I mean.&quot; 
Her eyes widened. &quot;I mean, uh, well, you&#39;re doing so well and all with 
learning about human ways, and uh, I thought maybe...&quot;
	&quot;Could I really?&quot; She locked eyes with me. &quot;Would you really take 
me with you?&quot;
	I smiled, pulling her closer.
	&quot;Of course I would.&quot; I paused a moment. &quot;I&#39;m saying this as a 
human, okay?&quot; I turned my gaze back to her green orbs. &quot;Your presence 
would be greatly welcome. It would make me really happy, if you came 
with me while I travel.&quot; I wanted to place my forehead on hers and just 
hold her close, but I restrained myself, my blush returning.
	Is it really possible to fall in love with someone in such a short 
time span? And then decide to ask them along as you continue on your 
journey? Does love really happen this fast? Or did I bump my head 
somewhere? I always thought love would never be this easy. ... Actually, 
wait a sec. That&#39;s not right. Easy is a lie. It was damned hard! 
Especially with that whole hate is love and vice versa. It got really 
hard from there. Just the first, &#39;I love you&#39; thing, went easy. After 
that? Well.... Lets just say that after that we ended up hitting one too 
many pot holes. ... Well, more like ditches, roadblocks, sudden dead 
ends, bottomless pits, and....
	Err, okay, back up. We as in &#39;our relationship&#39; didn&#39;t hit that 
many snags. We just hit... err, &#39;life&#39; would be putting it too simple. 
Remember that whole journey thing I mentioned? Weeellllll .... My darn 
feet led us into a few adventures that we could have been just dandy 
avoiding. Um, but that all comes later down the road. Back to Gren 
watching impishly as Na&#39;nal and I talked.
	&quot;I, speaking as a human, want to come with you,&quot; answered Na&#39;nal. 
&quot;Please?&quot;
	My whole face got red. When did she learn the word please?! AND, 
how to use it so expertly with those puppy dog eyes?! Darn it Gren!
	&quot;Y-you can come.&quot;
	She squealed, burying her face between her arm and my neck.
	&quot;So I should tell the others we have one more along for the ride?&quot; 
Gren&#39;s remark snapped me out of my dazed state.
	&quot;P-please, if you would. I&#39;ll make sure we&#39;re ready to head out 
when you are.&quot;
	Gren smirked again, her arms crossed over her modest chest.
	&quot;About that jar.&quot;
	I looked at her blankly.
	&quot;Jar?&quot;
	She guffawed.
	&quot;Yes, the jar you broke.&quot;
	I followed her gaze.
	&quot;Aw jeeze! I broke it?! I&#39;m sorry! Um, what do I need to do in 
return?&quot;
	Gren laughed, then shook her head.
	&quot;No, don&#39;t worry about it. You&#39;ve been working hard enough as it 
is. Just finish moving the rest.&quot;
	&quot;Are you sure?&quot;
	&quot;Yes. I have to be off, now. I was supposed to be back at camp a 
while ago to help with preparations. You might want to finish letting 
people know that you&#39;re leaving, take care of any loose ends.&quot;
	&quot;Thanks Gren. I do have a few things I can think of.&quot; She grinned, 
waving as she trotted off. I turned my gaze back to Na&#39;nal. &quot;Well, I 
need to finish moving these jars, but after I&#39;m done, we can go start 
getting your things ready.&quot;
	&quot;Okay. I&#39;ll wait over on the bench.&quot;
	With her watching, and after the excitement of current events, I 
got the rest of the jars moved in two thirds the time it took me to move 
the first few. Everything after that, went like clockwork. We went and 
got organized and packed, we talked to everyone we needed to, and then 
we went to bed early and rose the sixth day and headed out.
	Now, that was just the story of how we met. And also, as I 
mentioned before, lets you know, and hopefully understand, that when I&#39;m 
insulting my beloved, I&#39;m actually complimenting her. But, that isn&#39;t 
the end of the story.
	You see, things really started to happen after that. A lot of 
things. It wasn&#39;t shortly after we left that we ran into our first 
pothole. After the first pothole, a dozen more seemed to follow. Really, 
when we finally thought we were through with one incident, the next came 
up to bite us in the butt. I still swear to this day that Trer&#39;mon had a 
hand in all of it. He, of course, denies it. As if I believe him. He is 
a fairy after all. They only tell you the whole truth when it suits 
them... Which is really whenever they feel like being nice. Really nice.
	But, anyway, it&#39;s easier to continue from where I left off, after 
I met Na&#39;nal. Everything happened so quickly after that, it wouldn&#39;t 
make sense to jump around all over the place trying to tell you in a 
jumbled mess. So, I&#39;ll just tell you as they came. Though, I must admit 
I did skip a few earlier adventures, but, though they were exciting, 
they weren&#39;t as life altering as when I met Na&#39;nal.
	There you have it. She&#39;s my everything in life, and I&#39;m not afraid 
to say so. Even though I had adventures before I met her, the adventure 
of meeting her is always where I feel like it REALLY started. Sometimes 
I get teased. People saying, &quot;was there ever really a time for you 
BEFORE, she entered the picture?&quot;. I always laugh and tell them it just 
didn&#39;t seem like much without her in it. Grant it, I was a nervous wreck 
for a while because I didn&#39;t know how to proceed with things. Really, 
courting a troll, is ... something else. I still don&#39;t think I ever got 
it right. I barely taught her how to be human enough that we managed 
alright. Either way, our time with the caravan helped tremendously.
	While we were with the caravan, she learned how to do a great deal 
of things. She can actually cook a good meal now. Forgive me, but trolls 
must have sandpaper for tongues, because all of their food, be it taste 
or texture or sight, can make even the most strong stomached hurl. It 
was the hardest thing in the world, trying to figure out whether to 
insult her as a troll or a human when I ate her first few attempts at 
cooking. I know that it sounds horrible of me to say that, and I&#39;m 
sorry, but, if you had eaten any of it, you would understand completely.
	She also turned out to have a knack for finding and mixing herbs. 
She has quite a variety she carries around in case of emergencies, such 
as for wounds, poisons, and illness and such. The healer riding with the 
caravan took Na&#39;nal under her wing and taught her a great deal of 
things, herbs being only one of them. Lets just say, when I come home 
all banged up, she knows how to put me back together.
	My sweet Na&#39;nal cannot sew. We&#39;ve tried the venue many times, and 
in the end, she&#39;s too impatient, and adoringly clumsy. I&#39;m afraid 
everything she attempts to make... really isn&#39;t anything but a mess, an 
unidentifiable mesh of string and cloth. There were also several times I 
had to comfort her for the many pricks on her fingers. Now days, if 
something needs mending or sewn, she gives it to me and walks off in a 
huff.
	She has learned some patience with animals, but she still needs to 
be reminded now and again. Her patience for animals is often very short. 
I can&#39;t count how many times she&#39;s gone of screaming curses at horses, 
dogs, mules.... Not muttered curses, no. I&#39;m talking full blown, fist 
shaking, red in the face, top of the voice, screaming. When she gets to 
that point, everyone knows to call for me. I&#39;m the only one who can get 
her to calm down. The last person who tried to calm her almost got his 
teeth knocked out.
	The last two skills my Na&#39;nal has, this isn&#39;t to say she can&#39;t do 
other things, but I have to admit these are my favorite, are her skills 
in dance and the flute. I cannot help but brag. Na&#39;nal&#39;s dancing, is 
enthralling. She&#39;s beautiful. Once she got the hang of it, she soared 
with it. I do not know how she manages to leave her unsteady feet 
behind, but when she dances, gone is my clumsy Na&#39;nal, and out is her 
graceful fluid side. Her dance is breathtaking. Her flute playing? I 
always get lost to her music. Though she cannot sing, and she&#39;s a little 
too clumsy with her hands to play a stringed instrument, she plays the 
flute like she&#39;s played it all her life. Yes, of all that she can do, I 
love it most when she dances or plays. Though I must admit, it&#39;s also 
really nice to know that if I&#39;m broken, she knows how to fix me.
	The first trial we were to face, however, was a simple split of 
the road. Sounds rather funny that a simple split in the road would be 
our first adventure. But let me explain better what happened. We had 
stopped at the split to consider which way to take, all knowing that if 
we went right, our travel time would be cut tremendously, and we could 
make it to the next town by sunset. However...
	&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; I asked, Na&#39;nal a few steps behind me. Moen, 
the caravan leader, Gren, and a woman named Collense, were eyeing both 
paths warily.
	&quot;We&#39;re trying to decide which way to go,&quot; answered Gren, looking 
up from the map the three of them were looking at.
	&quot;But didn&#39;t you tell me the right one is shorter?&quot;
	&quot;Yes, but there have been rumors going about that people using the 
right one haven&#39;t been returning.&quot;
	&quot;Not returning?&quot;
	Moen nodded.
	&quot;Yes. There are no sure reports, because supposedly all who have 
gone in, haven&#39;t come out. But, there is something in there keeping them 
from coming back. It&#39;s just, no one knows what it is.&quot;
	I eyed the dense trees towering over the well worn road.
	&quot;So, in other words, it would probably be wise to take the longer 
route?&quot;
	Gren shrugged.
	&quot;Pretty much.&quot;
	A high pitched shriek made all of us jump. A woman came racing 
around the bend on the road to the right. She ran towards us blindly, 
her gaze locked on the road behind her. Moen and Collense jumped out of 
the way, letting the woman run headlong into me. We both fell to the 
ground. The woman screamed louder, blood running into her eyes from a 
gash on her forehead. I sat up and put my hands on her shoulders, 
pushing her slightly away so I could look at her face to face.
	&quot;Hey, hey, HEY!&quot; My shout made her stop screaming and actually 
look at me, her jaw hanging open in shock. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;
	&quot;I-I-I-I....&quot;
	I sighed softly, relaxing my grip slightly on her shoulders.
	&quot;Are you alright?&quot; I asked again. She whimpered, but slowly 
nodded, tears coursing down her face. &quot;What happened?&quot;
	&quot;Ambushed! Giant, things! So fast! We tried to run, to escape! 
But-but...&quot; she let out a shuddering gasp. &quot;They got them all! All of 
them! I&#39;m the only one...! I&#39;m the only one that...!&quot; She broke down 
into sobs, hands covering her face. I frowned, looking up at Moen and 
the others crowded around us.
	&quot;Will you look after her?&quot;
	Moen&#39;s frown deepened.
	&quot;Why? What are you going to do?&quot;
	I gently passed the sobbing woman to Gren. I stood up, brushing 
off the seat of my pants.
	&quot;I&#39;m going to go see what attacked her.&quot;
	&quot;Are you stupid? Obviously her caravan couldn&#39;t handle it. What do 
you think you can do?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m just going to take a look.&quot;
	&quot;People don&#39;t go take a look unless they plan on pursuing the 
matter.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s not safe to leave things as they are. What if another 
caravan goes in there unknowingly?&quot;
	&quot;So?&quot;
	&quot;So, I need to see what&#39;s in there so I can pass the word or put 
up a sign. We can&#39;t let anyone else wander in there without letting them 
know something&#39;s in there.&quot;
	&quot;Of course we can. We already know something&#39;s in there. She&#39;s 
proof enough for that.&quot; She jerked a thumb at the woman. I shook my 
head.
	&quot;That isn&#39;t enough to go by. People will still go in, thinking 
it&#39;s just a ruse.&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s their problem.&quot;
	I smirked.
	&quot;It is at the moment, but things could get worse, you know.&quot;
	I gripped my sword and checked to make sure nothing extra or noisy 
was weighing me down. Moen grabbed my arm.
	&quot;You&#39;re not a bad fighter, but I don&#39;t think you can handle this, 
and I&#39;m not sending any of my women in there with you, either.&quot;
	I shrugged, slipping out of her grip.
	&quot;Listen, I&#39;m going in whether you like it or not. If I&#39;m not back 
before dusk, leave.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but glance at Na&#39;nal, who was 
currently bent over the women to check her wounds. I lowered my voice. 
&quot;If I don&#39;t come back, please take care of Na&#39;nal.&quot;
	&quot;Can I really not talk you out of it?&quot;
	I grinned crookedly.
	&quot;&#39;fraid I can be as stubborn as a mule sometimes. This just 
happens to be one of them.&quot; I looked towards the road. &quot;Hope to see you 
soon.&quot;
	I squared my shoulders and continued down the road to the right. I 
could feel the worried gazes on my back. There was a short outcry from 
Na&#39;nal, but it was silenced shortly by Moen and Gren, who held her back. 
I entered the wall of trees, and entered into silence, turning the bend 
and leaving all of them behind.
	The silence was the first thing I noticed. It was dead silent, 
even the wind not daring to stir the trees. I&#39;m glad I learned how to 
make my steps silent, so at least I might have the advantage of 
surprise. There weren&#39;t any animals either. Nothing moved, not even a 
stray bird in a tree. It felt empty, haunted. There was no life 
anywhere.
	It wasn&#39;t for a long while that I finally noticed the webbing. At 
first, it was only here and there, little bits clinging from one tree to 
the next, or covering a little bit of this bush or that shrub. The 
farther I went, though, the more I began seeing, till all the trees were 
covered with thick white webbing. I pulled my sword out, my skin 
crawling. I could feel eyes on me, following me, but not a single sound 
greeted me.
	The hair on the back of my neck rose, and I instinctively ducked 
and rolled away. A swishing sound greeted my ears, a slight breeze 
rustling my hair as a long scaly tail whipped over my head. I came to a 
crouch a couple yards away, coming face to face, for the first time, the 
creatures that plagued this path. I nearly jumped out of my skin.
	Hovering before me was a monster I hadn&#39;t seen before. It had a 
long snake like tail, the torso and head of a man, four legs and 
mandibles of a spider. Its nose was only a couple of holes where the 
nose should be, and his eyes were small and elongated. It&#39;s scales from 
the tail also ran up its back to end in a V shape between its eyes.
	It struck again, moving so swiftly I couldn&#39;t avoid it completely. 
A simple tap on my shoulder sent my flying into a tree. I sat for half a 
breath in shock. How on earth could such an awkward built creature be so 
agile? Let alone, how could it be so strong, too?
	I had to act fast when it came again. I jumped behind a tree and 
avoided its third attack. The tree wasn&#39;t so lucky. There was a nice 
sized hole where the spidery leg made contact.
	&quot;Crap.&quot;
	The next few moments were a blur. I don&#39;t really know what 
happened, and I think instinct had a lot to do with my survival. The 
next thing I knew, the monster was standing above me and my blade sunk 
deep into its chest. I learned something else about the monster, and I 
learned it the hard way. No, it wasn&#39;t the webbing it could shoot from 
its mouth, though that wasn&#39;t exactly fun either. No, this was a lot 
more painful lesson to learn, one learned a little late.
	As the purple blood seeped from the now dead monster, it fell, 
quite well, all over me. Down my sword, onto my hands, dripping onto my 
clothes face, and torso. I was fine for the first few seconds, pushing 
the dead husk starting to curl off of me. Suddenly, I was on fire. My 
skin burned, and my clothes hissed as they slowly began to be eaten 
away. Everywhere the blood had fallen, was being burned. I ground my 
teeth. Acid.
	&quot;Damn thing!&quot; I cursed to myself. I was about to rip my sleeve to 
wipe off the blood, when the hiss of a second creature made me leap away 
from my first kill. I swallowed hard. I was surrounded by the monsters, 
all varying in size, but none as big as the one I had killed. &quot;Damn pox 
ridden, pieces of...&quot;  I growled, then launched myself at the closest 
one.
	What else could I do? But, curse me for being stupid enough to see 
what the heck was causing all those disappearances. I should have left 
it well enough alone. This is why Trer&#39;mon always teases me. Sometimes I 
wish I had the power to go back and slap my past self. I would knock 
some sense into my dense little head.
	My quick attack worked. I took the first one by surprise, killing 
it swiftly before dashing away to try and take on the next two. I took 
the fight into the trees, leaping into the nearest one. They could climb 
as well, but they couldn&#39;t leap from tree to tree as swiftly as I could. 
I used that too my advantage, striking those left on the ground quickly, 
then jumping away to strike one coming out of a tree to get me. I still 
couldn&#39;t avoid all the attacks though. I was still tossed about like a 
rag doll, and blood soon splattered my entire being, burning my flesh 
ever so slowly.
	I lost track of time in that mad dash for survival. I had to keep 
moving so fast and rely so much on my instincts, I didn&#39;t get a chance 
to register what all was happening. It was only a stroke of luck, and 
the blessings of having lived with the wildcats, that I made it through. 
I was the last thing standing. Their dead bodies were lying scattered 
around me, curled up in fetal positions. I was barely standing myself. I 
looked like I went through a blender.
	I waited for a while, to see if any others might jump out at me. 
None did. I felt exhausted, and my skin burned where the blood acid 
touched. There was too much blood acid covering me to have any luck 
wiping it off. I looked around, my sword still ready in my hand. I had 
to bear the pain, and it did take my mind off other wounds I might have. 
I was too afraid to assess my situation until I knew someone was there 
to take care of me. I figured I would go into shock and end up dead 
because I wasn&#39;t close enough for someone to help me.
	I heard a soft moan. I swiveled around, my sword at ready. Nothing 
moved. The moan came again. Slowly, I made my way toward the source. I 
parted the webbing with the tip of my sword, and gasped.
	A man lay captured within the webbing. He was in a cocoon, very 
much alive. I scanned the rest of the area and found similar cocoons. 
I immediately began searching the webbing in hopes of life. Some 
revealed dried husks of people or animals, sometimes birds, their 
wrinkled dry skin flaking away in the wind. Yet, there were still many 
filled with people and animals that were alive. I began freeing them as 
quickly as I could.
	&quot;Cenin.&quot;
	The voice took me completely by surprise. I whirled around to have 
Trer&#39;mon staring at me from the tip of my sword. I blinked, then quickly 
pulled away my sword.
	&quot;Trer&#39;mon! What are you doing here?!&quot;
	He gazed around.
	&quot;I was going to ask you the same.&quot;
	I felt a tingle run down my spine.
	&quot;Trer&#39;mon, we have to free everyone and get them out of here as 
fast as possible. I don&#39;t like the feel of this place.&quot; I gently 
fingered the web. &quot;And, a fairy magic show of flames might help clear 
this place up. I don&#39;t want them coming back.&quot;
	He watched me, then looked at the fallen monsters.
	&quot;They&#39;re demons. They shouldn&#39;t even be here. How they escaped 
their domain is beyond me. However, you are correct. Nothing must 
remain, not even their corpses.&quot; He looked at me worriedly.
	&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. You start ridding us of the bodies, and I&#39;ll finish 
freeing those trapped in the webbing.&quot;
	&quot;The demons venom will wear off, but not very fast. If you want 
haste, I&#39;m afraid the going will be unavoidably slow.&quot;
	I gazed at the group I had already freed.
	&quot;Maybe so, but I wont leave them behind.&quot; I quickly went back to 
work, Trer&#39;mon wandering off to start ridding us of the demons&#39; husks. 
We worked silently and efficiently for a time. I had finally gotten all 
the people out, and Trer&#39;mon had begun burning the webbing. He let out a 
whistle.
	&quot;I&#39;m glad we&#39;re taking care of this!&quot; he called. &quot;There are egg 
sacks here! Much longer and they would have hatched!&quot;
	I shivered. Such a thing was not appealing at all. Having to deal 
with them once was enough for me. To this day they sometimes haunt my 
dreams.
	A high pitched inhuman screech made both of us stop dead in our 
tracks. We turned at the same time. Looming at the edge of a bend in the 
road, was the largest, ugliest, and meanest looking demon of them all. 
It had hair and scales everywhere. It&#39;s abdomen was twice as large as 
the others, and its whole body a third longer. There were obvious swells 
in the chest area, making this the first female one I had seen. It was 
staring hard at Trer&#39;mon, who was currently burning one of the said egg 
sacks.
	I moved an instant before the demon did. I dashed forward, picking 
up a rock. I stepped between Trer&#39;mon and it, then threw the rock as 
hard as I could. My aim was true, striking the demon square in the head. 
A deep gash bled from above her eye, making her pause in her ballistic 
rush. It screeched again, and fighting off my frozen panic, I pivoted 
and took off as fast as I could down the path. I ran away from Trer&#39;mon 
and away from the helpless people I had rescued.
	Now, what hadn&#39;t occurred to me at the time, was which way down 
the path I was running. If I had, I would have chosen a better 
direction. You see, I took off down the road TOWARDS the caravan, and my 
dear Na&#39;nal. I was leading the danger right to them. I, however, was 
about as blind as a bat in daylight, by that time. I was half delirious 
from being tossed about and being bled on by acid. I didn&#39;t realize my 
mistake at all... until I rounded that last bend, and there they were, 
in all their glory, sitting right in the middle of the road where I had 
left them. 
	What luck.
	By this time, miss spider snake thingy, saw all the nice little 
flies just waiting for the picking, and was getting ready to have a 
hay-day. I was such an idiot.
	Miss spider thing veered off and went for the next available 
target, which just so happened to be Moen. She, bless her soul, was fast 
enough to draw her weapon and get in a quick slice, making the demon 
turn away. The demon moved on to Gren, who, by this time, was armed and 
ready as well. Collense tried to come up behind it, but it spun around 
and knocked her back several yards.
	Me? I had stopped running completely and was stupidly watching 
everything unfold. My sword hung limp in my hand, and I just stood there 
and gawked. The others were getting desperate to hold off the demon, and 
I just couldn&#39;t tear my eyes away. I watched in silent awe as they got 
flung this way and that, sometimes managing a lucky strike, but I didn&#39;t 
do a thing to help them, even when the other women grabbed weapons to 
help retaliate.
	Na&#39;nal&#39;s scream was what finally brought me to my senses.
	The demon had bowled over the others and finally came face to face 
with a target it knew it could easily overtake. Na&#39;nal was cowering 
against one of the wagon wheels, her eyes as wide as saucers. It moved 
swiftly, coming to a stop just in front of her. The others were 
shouting, trying to gather themselves to aid her. The demon ignored 
them, knocking the few that were close away with its tail. It hissed, 
its tail slithering across the dirt. The demon actually managed a 
horrific version of a smirk. 
	As battered and sore as I was, rage filled me, giving me strength 
when I should have none left. The demon cocked its head, twisting it to 
the side, before thrusting its head forward again, mouth gaping. 	
Na&#39;nal&#39;s scream filled the forest.
