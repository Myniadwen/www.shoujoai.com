<p>VOLUME SEVEN: NO PLACE LIKE  IT</p>
<p>“Hallow’s Point:  where Eve rests her head”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Derian Kazcada had been  merely a foot soldier, so his failure was expected. Rose Gillian was  a rogue, and her betrayal was inevitable. But Professor Hill had <em>potential</em>, even with his madness; his was a genius no rule  could contain. But perhaps it was this very madness that led to his  ruin. No, there was something ingrained even deeper into his mind  which caused him to turn. Professor Hill had the unmistakably human  quality of <em>passion</em>, that irrational drive that leads so many  to ruin. Even if his goal had been pure, he was still led astray—by  his experiments, his daughter, his lust for knowledge; it didn’t  matter. In the end, he was nothing more than a hound that had  followed the wrong scent.</p>
<p>There were far more useful  dogs at Origin’s disposal. The Fog Ninjas had been an ingenious  creation, an invincible and overwhelming force that would spread  everywhere, giving Origin more knowledge and power. The Ozmund  Company was already being drawn into their arms, and soon the UCM  would follow; it was growing corrupt and would easily be swayed.  Boole had mastered them all, persuading the weaker brood to his  ideals, carefully crafting traps and half-truths to seduce and  ensnare the unwary. Of the weak, he used and threw away as need  dictated, only expressing a mild disappointment if they failed him.  But even this was pathetic: one day, very soon now, he would  disregard even the most glaring mistakes, chalking them up to human  error, results of passion and poor planning, and would then move to  the next stage without giving a moment’s pause. Disappointment  would be as separated from his mind as love and hatred; it was  useless to keep clinging to it. One day he would learn. One day, he  would be perfect.</p>
<p>A trivial but pressing  matter engaged his thoughts for a time: who was he going to trust the  Fog Ninjas to? Certainly nobody that had shown any sign of dissent or  independence. People like the Jackal and Changera had their uses, but  they were not as loyal to Origin as Kazcada or Professor Hill. That  woman from the races, Asara, craved power, but she was merely a child  playing in a sandbox. Lord Demise might be a more fitting candidate,  but he would certainly refuse; he already had an indestructible army.  The Dutchman, perhaps? But Barbarossa had a power that could rival  Boole’s, perhaps even Origin’s. Keeping him around was dangerous;  he would not follow the bait they were dangling before him forever.  Boole knew he could not trust the latest recruit to their care…but  thinking about him created a new path of possibilities. Who else,  save the Dutchman himself, would be best suited to assassinate that  group of women?</p>
<p>“Ferocious,” he  called. A tall, muscular man armed with eight swords stepped out of  the darkness, grinning dangerously. “I have a job for you. Go to  the station orbiting Silvanus and seek out the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em>.  Origin has stated they have outlived their usefulness. Use any means  necessary to kill them.”</p>
<p>“Heheheh, so these  people are a threat to the boss, eh? I wonder what kinda freaks they  are. Hey—DO THEY PLAY WITH FIRE, MAN? CAN THEY STAND THE HEAT?! ARE  THEY PACKING A KITCHEN SINK?! I can’t WAIT to rip off their little  heads and go BOWLING WITH THEIR SKULLS!! No, wait a second, I’ve  got a better idea! I’ll just throw them into batter and make  biscuits out of them! GET READY LADIES, CUZ’ HERE COMES THE GRAVY!!  AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!!!! …Uh, crap, my zipper’s  stuck. HELP A POOR GUY OUT, WILL YA MAN?!”</p>
<p>“Just leave,” Boole  grumbled. He forced himself to regain control of his disgusting  emotions as Ferocious slipped back into the darkness.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>It didn’t take Aseria  long to find Silvanus and Hallow’s Point; she had visited the area  before on several business trips. Even the Sindar race knew about the  exceptional mechanic that lived there in the station, although Aseria  had never met her personally. Lil didn’t care to go, so Aseria  would be on her own for this journey. She would have some company,  though: Herut and Kyrie were itching to meet the famous Wrench, and  Eve was going too, of course. The rest of the crew was split on the  decision, but most of them elected to stay behind or explore other  areas, citing that lately, every time they left the ship, something  disastrous happened.</p>
<p>“Duh! That’s what  adventures are all about,” Kyrie snorted. Oh well. A handful of  intrepid women disembarked and registered for their visit to the  station. Unlike the last one they visited, this satellite colony had  artificial gravity, and in fact, most stations did; that last one was  a luxury design that intentionally gave its residents and visitors  the sensation of weightlessness. It was quickly decided that Eve  would lead the way, since she spent a portion of her life here, but  that had been so long ago that she barely recognized the place.</p>
<p>It was true that Hallow’s  Point had changed since that “Human Front” space pirate attack  several years earlier. Construction had worked around the clock to  patch up holes, rebuild businesses, cut off areas beyond repair, and  clean up the messes. The sections that had suffered the worst under  the pirates’ rage were completely unrecognizable: none of the old  shops were around anymore, including a few places Eve had frequented,  and mourned for. Hallow’s Point was more like a city than an  enclosed space station: the metropolis stretched all the way around  inside the satellite, layers of skyscrapers intermingling with parks,  lakes, houses, roads, stadiums, schools, hospitals— all the  comforts of surface life.</p>
<p>“You know, before I came  here, I didn’t have anything,” Eve mentioned. Even though  everything had changed, she still had a nostalgic look in her eye.  This had been the only real home she ever knew; even back on Gaea,  she never felt like she really “belonged”. “Believe it or not,  I was a Senator’s daughter. But I got sick and tired of that life,  so I ran away and drifted for awhile. My father and stepmother  disowned me soon after, not that I really cared. I ended up here  after I heard how tourists came to Silvanus before reaching the  Helios System. Maybe I wanted to find out what they saw in the world  I left behind— you know, get an outsider’s perspective. I didn’t  have a job, so I was strapped for about a month, but then I found the  Wrench’s garage. I just stepped into this diner for something to  eat, saw a ‘help wanted’ ad, and got my foot in the door.”</p>
<p>“So you got the job on  the spot?” Kyrie asked. Eve nodded.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Weird, huh? I  guess the old grease monkey saw something in me. Anyway, that’s how  I became such a wizard with machines. I was forced to leave when  these space pirates calling themselves ‘the Human Front’  attacked, and I haven’t been back here since.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“No reason,” she  answered, stuffing her hands in her pockets. “I’ve been sort of  busy. You know, people were after me cuz’ of my skills, I had a few  jobs here and there, and then there’s my stint with you guys. I  suppose you could say I was just procrastinating; I dunno. Anyway,  that attack took away my legs and my eye, which is where these  prosthetics come in, but that’s also where I found my Zeta.”</p>
<p>“You mean that battle  android you left behind?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I really miss  that guy. I mean, I guess it was for the best that I left him behind.  He wouldn’t have been very free on the Dauntless.” Kyrie smiled  sweetly and scurried so she could walk by Eve’s side.</p>
<p>“You really love your  machines, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Of course. If you work  with them long enough, you form a bond. Sometimes you even share a  piece of your soul with them.”</p>
<p>“I totally agree!” she  grinned. “It’s the same with my inventions!”</p>
<p>“So where is this  garage?” Aseria asked, feeling uncomfortable with the current  subject. Kyrie turned around and stuck her tongue out at her.</p>
<p>“You in some kind of  hurry, elf girl? Eve and I are bonding here!” Kasberry smirked.</p>
<p>“If you think I’m  something else, you should see the Wrench. But to answer your  question, Aseria, it’s right next to a place called Jesse’s  diner, just a few blocks down this road. She shares a place with her  husband. Bring in something for repairs or a tune-up, and your meal’s  half-off. Business was pretty good back when I was here. They’ve  got kids, too, Lenora and Ashton— real great folks.” Eve  neglected to tell them that these people were the closest to a real  family she ever got, largely because it was embarrassing, but also  because she was still thinking about what Director Astor had told  her, and she didn’t want to get her hopes up.</p>
<p>Eve felt stupid when she  learned she had led everyone the long way around. The docking bay and  her destination were closer than she remembered, but this made sense  considering the attack and the convenience of having a mechanic’s  shop and diner so close to port. After kicking herself for a moment,  Eve proudly presented the only place in the galaxy she had ever felt  welcome: Jesse’s Diner and The Wrench Garage. The two businesses  were directly connected to one another, so patrons having their  vehicles looked at would be able to sit back and have some lunch  while they waited. Eve was amazed they were still in good shape  considering the intensity of the attack, but it <em>had</em> been five  years ago; surely to goodness Jesse and Carly would be able to  restore their home by then.</p>
<p>“Do they live here?”  Herut asked.</p>
<p>“Nah, there’s a  residence above the diner. I’m pretty sure Len and Ash have already  moved out, but who knows?” Eve led the small group into the diner,  which was so sparse that everyone could almost have a table to  herself. But it was also clean and well-kept, and the atmosphere  seemed happy without being overpowering. Sweet jazz and blues drifted  out of a device built to replicate something called a “jukebox”,  and the pungent aroma of cooking food was the delicious groom to a  melodious bride. The head chef was reading a newspaper behind the  counter, and looked up with a warm smile to greet his guests.</p>
<p>“Hey there, come on in!  If you’ve got…WHOA! Holy cow! Is that you, Evita?”</p>
<p>“Hey,” she saluted  coolly. “Been a long time, old man.” Jesse laughed out loud and  dashed against her, throwing his arms around and squeezing her  firmly.</p>
<p>“It really is you! I’m  so happy! Carlisle’s gonna flip when she hears about this! God, the  kids are gonna go nuts! What are you doing here? When did you get  back? Are you all right? You look fantastic!”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she  chuckled. “I see you’re as friendly as ever, Jess. So how have  you been?”</p>
<p>“Uh, well, generally,  it’s been pretty good here, but we sure have missed you. So where  have you been all this time?”</p>
<p>“Just here and there,”  she gestured. “I came back to see if the old bat was still kicking.  From the looks of things, you pulled out of that attack without any  problems.”</p>
<p>“You know Carly,” he  grinned. “She only lost it when she heard you left us. You  should’ve seen the look on her face. We were all really worried.”</p>
<p>“Sorry I put you through  all that shit,” she sighed remorsefully. “I didn’t mean to. I  just thought those people were after me, and I didn’t want to get  you involved anymore. It turned out I did have a price on my head,  but not anymore. Hey, is your wife in? I’m gonna go give her a  heart attack.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she’d  appreciate it,” he laughed. “She’s in the back tinkering on a  bike for some famous racer. Hey, while you’re here, how about a  round for your friends on the house?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do  that,” Fuuka tittered. Jesse’s glowing smile tore right through  her defenses.</p>
<p>“Sure I do! Consider it  a welcoming gift from me to you! Please, have a seat. Eve, what’ll  you have?”</p>
<p>“I’m thinking I could  go for a grilled tuna and bacon. Could I have some cornbread too,  instead of fries?”</p>
<p>“Sure. It should be  ready by the time you ladies are through with your reunion.” There  was a doorway and an antechamber that led from the diner to the  garage; the aroma of food wafted with the odor of grease and oil as  Eve, Herut, and Kyrie made the transition. The garage had sights,  smells, and sounds akin to its brother, but it was dirtier and even  more colorful here: there were piles of scrap carefully organized  against one side of the wall, and on the other was a large board  covered with various tools, each arranged in an order only the Wrench  understood. Usually, it would be noisy with the sound of tinkering,  cursing, hammering, bargaining, and laughing, but now it was  tranquil, almost scary. Somewhere in this world of metal, rubber,  lubricant, and machinery was a famous mechanic, Eve’s mentor and  possible mother, the foul-mouthed, golden-hearted Wrench. They  noticed a pair of legs sticking out from underneath a three-wheel  motorcycle, the jeans beaten up and ripped, saturated with years of  labor. A grease-stained hand waved at them, brandishing a  screwdriver.</p>
<p>“I don’t take  walk-ins. I work by appointment only. Go back to the front office and  ask the girl there to schedule a meeting.”</p>
<p>“Is that any way to  treat your protégé, you old grease monkey?!” The woman banged her  head against the bike in surprise, cursed wildly, and rolled out,  staring up with soot-stained goggles. She snapped them off, rubbed  her hands, and jumped to her feet— not only alive, but very well  from the looks of it. Carly was just as sexy and spry as she had been  three decades ago, so five more years weren’t going to change her  vigor. Even so, her face flushed with emotion as she recognized the  woman standing before her; tears formed in her eyes as she laughed  out loud.</p>
<p>“<em>Mi Dios</em>, if it  isn’t the prodigal herself! I’ll be a god-damned monkey’s  uncle! How in all the nine Hells are you, ya stubborn little punk?!  And who are you calling old? Come here and gimme a hug!!”</p>
<p>“URK!” Carly was  stronger than she looked; Eve nearly passed out from the wrenching  embrace. “Okay, okay, I missed you too, ya lummox! Now lemme go  before my head pops!” Carly laughed and gave her former student a  kiss on the cheek, ruffling her hair like an old buddy.</p>
<p>“Hey, you can’t blame  me for getting excited! I haven’t heard from you in years, Evita!  You owe me big time for all those nights I sat up worrying about you.  Never mind— you can fill me in on the sob stories later. How are <em>you</em> doing? You just took off with that Z-95 of yours without  saying a word. I heard you went to the hospital after that disaster;  it seems you got some new legs. Pretty snazzy!”</p>
<p>“They do come in handy,”  she murmured.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll bet! So  where have you been? What brings you out this far? I’ll slug you if  I found out you came all this way just for repairs!”</p>
<p>“No, no, it’s nothing  like that. I just wanted to see how you were.”</p>
<p>“What, so you didn’t  think I’d make it? God-damn it, woman, who d’ya think you’re  talking to? I’ve survived worse than a little crossfire and a few  explosions. Hell, I barely even got a scratch! It’s you I was  worried about! Never mind; I’m babbling. So who are these people?  Wait— Evita!” Carly raised her eyebrow craftily and ribbed her  protégé slyly. “Can it be? Do you actually have <em>friends</em>?”  Eve had to meditate on that one. She hadn’t really noticed it  before, but she was growing closer to these people— not just to  Herut and Kyrie, but everyone, even those she thought she could never  relate to. She realized she really did make friends during those five  years.</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah,” she  murmured bashfully. “This is Herut and Kyrie, and there are more in  the diner.” Carly leaned over to grin at the two ladies, who were  feeling a little starstruck.</p>
<p>“If I didn’t see it, I  wouldn’t believe it: our little Evita really has friends. Now  that’s something. She was so freakin’ antisocial back in the day  that I was afraid she’d never find anybody to hang out with. But I  guess I was worried for nothing. So d’ya have a girlfriend too?”</p>
<p>Now Eve had to think about  her relationship with the Jackal, but it didn‘t take nearly as  long. In that brief moment, she finally came to a decision regarding  her feelings.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“No? Jeez, that’s a  shame. But you’re young; you shouldn’t have to settle down  anytime soon. Hell, I didn’t get married until I was thirty! So  you’re…Herut, right?” She vigorously shook the petite woman’s  hand, and Herut blushed from the attention. “Uh, correct me if I’m  wrong, but you’re an M&amp;R unit, right?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yes ma’am, that’s  correct.”</p>
<p>“Call me Carly,” she  insisted. “I’ve always wanted to meet a real M&amp;R. How would  you like to work for me for a few years?”</p>
<p>“Um, thanks, but I’ll  have to pass for now. M-maybe later.”</p>
<p>“Aw, hell. Sucks for me.  And you’re Kyrie? Wait— don’t tell me. Oh my god! Kyrie <em>Lastgear</em>?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah. You’ve  heard of me?” Carly cackled and slapped Kyrie’s back.</p>
<p>“<em>Heard</em> of you? Your mother and I went to school together! We cheated,  partied, and seduced our way through high school and college! Damn!  So you’re Kyrshe’s kid, huh? How the  hell is the old demoness, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Well, before I left  Vulcannis, mom told me she was experimenting with sound waves and  seismic activity. I think she wanted to make a machine that either  prevented earthquakes, or caused them.”</p>
<p>“Knowing her, it could  be both!” she laughed. “So what about you? Interested in working  for me? I’d love to talk shop with a Lastgear again! It’ll be  just like the old days!” Eve rolled her eyes and pulled the two  women away from each other.</p>
<p>“Honestly, Wrench, you  can be such a dork sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I appreciate good  talent when I see it. I hired <em>you</em>, didn’t I? Anyway, why  don’t you let me finish working on this bike? I can spare you more  time after that. Ask Jesse to bring the kids over; they’ll be glad  to see you again. Len’s in my office and Ash is in the kitchen. Oh,  before I forget…” She led them over to a corner in her garage,  where a large figure was covered by a white sheet. Carly unfurled the  sheet carefully, coughing as a layer of dust was upset. Reclining  beneath the blanket was none other than Eve’s Executioner-class  battle android, the Z-95 nicknamed “Zeta”. She covered her mouth  in amazement and almost cried.</p>
<p>“We found him wandering  around here about a year ago,” Carly said. “The poor guy actually  made it all the way out here because he figured this was where he  could find you. I’ve never seen so much devotion in a machine  before, but I guess this proves how good you’ve become. <em>I’m</em> certainly impressed! Anyway, the kids and I tinkered with him a bit  and cleaned him up. He still responds to your voice, so whenever  you’re ready, just fire him up. Don’t look so pale!” she  exclaimed, laughing at Kyrie and Herut. “He’s perfectly safe. I  took out all his ammunition. Zeta’s more like a puppy than a killer  robot anyway.” She touched the machine’s head affectionately, her  face glowing with love as Eve’s had, and gingerly resumed her work  on the bike as Eve approached her old friend.</p>
<p>“Zeta? Do you still  remember me?” The robot whirred to life, its limbs moving as  fluidly as water as it stood up and “stretched”. It glanced down  at Eve and, amazingly, waved its hand.</p>
<p>[Hello, Evie! It’s been  a long time since we’ve seen each other. I looked everywhere for  you! I’m glad to see you’re all right.]</p>
<p>“He’s <em>glad</em>?”  Herut grimaced. Kyrie shrugged.</p>
<p>“Sorry I made you worry  like that,” Eve said, grinning warmly as she caressed his cold  metallic face. “I wanted to go on a journey and I couldn’t bring  you with me.”</p>
<p>[I understand. Have you  come back here to stay? Mr. and Mrs. Migelo would be very happy if  you did, and of course, Len and Ash would love it as well.]</p>
<p>“Nah, this is just a pit  stop. I wanted to see how everybody was doing, and there’s  something I want to talk about with Carly. I never expected to run  into you, though!”</p>
<p>[Me neither! Forgive me  for disobeying your request and running off like that, but I was  concerned about you. I heard rumors that the military put a price on  your head, and I thought…well…]</p>
<p>“Don’t worry!” she  laughed, clear and pure for the first time in ages. “I spoke with  the Director and she canceled it. It turns out they wanted my  services in the worst way possible. I guess that’s what I get for  learning under the best.”</p>
<p>[It’s true that Mrs.  Migelo has no known rival outside of Demise Industries, so I can see  why the military would want you to work for them, but I’m happy you  decided to strike out on your own. Mrs. Migelo would be proud to hear  of that.] Eve grinned as color and life returned to her face; she was  like another person. The look of pure joy in her eyes was  unmistakable: she really was more comfortable around machines than  people.</p>
<p>“Damn it,” Carly  grunted as she emerged from the bike, “I told you a thousand times,  Zeta, just call me Carly. I hate formal titles.”</p>
<p>[Oh, please excuse me,  Mrs. Migelo. Are you finished with your job?]</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she sighed,  wiping the sweat from her brow. Carly loosened her stiff joints and  stretched, popping the air from her bones. For a woman in her  mid-fifties, she was in terrific shape, and if age affected anything,  it was her dark hair, which was slowly graying. She had given up  smoking cigars twenty-seven years earlier, which obviously  contributed to her longevity, and she also led a happy, active life,  full of love and excitement.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna take a  shower now. Once we all have some lunch, we’ll catch up on old  times. Feel free to stick around for a few days!” Eve turned around  and waved at her.</p>
<p>“Uh, hey, Carly? Can you  and I have a private chat later?”</p>
<p>“Whatever you gotta say,  you can say in front of my family. I don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“Please? Just the two of  us?” Carly sighed and shoved her hands in her pockets.</p>
<p>“Well, okay, if that’s  what you want. Anyway, try to take better care of Zeta from now on,  all right? The poor guy’s lost without you.”</p>
<p>[Very funny,] he replied  indignantly.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Ashton and Lenore didn’t  live with their parents, as Eve figured, but they did work for them:  the son in the kitchen with dad, ands the daughter working reception  for mom. They tackled Eve and hugged her until her face turned blue,  and yammered at her until her ears were ready to pop. The three had  been very close in the brief time Eve worked there, since they were  all mostly the same age, and up until her arrival on the <em>Dauntless</em>,  she had considered them her only friends. When she introduced them to  Fuuka, Aseria, Herut, and Kyrie, the siblings received them with the  same affection they showed Eve, and they also asked what kind of ship  they had used to get there.</p>
<p>“Uh, it’s hard to  say,” Herut pointed out. “She’s very…special. It’s not  something from this galaxy.”</p>
<p>“You don’t see that  very often,” Jesse noted. “So who’s the Captain?”</p>
<p>“There is no Captain,”  Aseria replied. “We do as we please.”</p>
<p>“Then who owns the  ship?”</p>
<p>“The legendary Dr.  Miracle,” she answered sarcastically. It was a good thing nobody  was carrying any dishes or glasses, or they would’ve dropped them.</p>
<p>“Are you <em>serious</em>?”  Aseria blinked at them and laughed.</p>
<p>“Don’t let the rumors  fool you. She’s really just a normal woman.”</p>
<p>“…I knew that.”  Carly smiled at her beloved.</p>
<p>“Once we’re finished  eating, you should take me to see your ship, and introduce me to Dr.  Miracle as well.”</p>
<p>“You’ll only be  disappointed,” Aseria warned her.</p>
<p>“Nah, I’m sure she’s  cool.”</p>
<p>“She’s certainly brave  for one so frail,” Fuuka admitted. She had totally fallen in love  with Jesse’s cooking, and begged him for several of his recipes.  “Mmm, oh Mr. Migelo, this is the second-tastiest thing I’ve ever  put in my mouth!”</p>
<p>“What’s the best?”  Kyrie asked. Fuuka smiled, well, foxily.</p>
<p>“Athena.”</p>
<p>“I walked right into  that one,” Kyrie grumbled.</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah,” Eve  coughed. “Anyway, after I show you around, we can talk in private,  so try not to geek out so much when you see our ship.”</p>
<p>“No guarantees,” Carly  grinned. Sure enough, once dinner was finished and Carly was shown to  the docking station, she went ballistic as she saw the <em>Dauntless</em>,  and insisted on a grand tour.</p>
<p>“I’ve died and gone to  heaven,” she crooned. Eve hung back, choosing to stay far away from  her mentor’s spastic glee— even though she could fully understand  her reaction— and located Dr. Miracle, who had recently got back  from touring the rest of the station. Carly liked her from the start,  and greeted her with a rough slap on the back, which Amy took  gracefully. Two hours later, however, she overstayed her welcome, and  had to be dragged back to her garage; there was no way she would’ve  left this treasure on her own.</p>
<p>For their private  conversation, Carly led Eve into her office, which was just as  colorful and disorganized as her garage. A plaque hung proudly on the  wall, proclaiming her mechanic’s license “for exceptional talent  and skill”, and right next to it was a photograph of the old Squad  Reliable team, with Carly on the far right, an aggressive smile on  her young face. Amidst the scattered papers, oil-crusted toolboxes,  file drawers filthy with rust, and various knickknacks thrown around,  the object with the most prominence was a picture of Carly’s  family: husband, son, daughter, and Eve the pupil glowering on the  side. She remembered having that photo taken; she hadn’t been happy  about it at the time. The Wrench once told her she considered all her  students part of the family. Is that what Astor meant?</p>
<p>“So what’d ya want to  talk to me about?” she said, pulling up two chairs. Eve let out a  small laugh as she glanced at the room.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you ever going  to clean this place up? It’s as dirty as your mind.”</p>
<p>“Maybe, but why risk  ruining the ambiance?”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you  were part of the exploration movement,” she sighed, glancing at the  photo of Squad Reliable. “You look really young in this photo.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m still young,  ya little punk!”</p>
<p>“Yeah yeah, sure sure. I  actually met the Director of the UCM. Is it true you two know each  other?”</p>
<p>“You mean little Claes?  Sure, we go way back! She was the Admiral’s granddaughter, and an  even bigger brat than you are! It’s scary how much she’s grown up  since then. So what’d you ladies talk about? I hope she didn’t  reveal any dark secrets of mine.”</p>
<p>“Oh, she might have let  a few slip,” Eve said, matching her mentor’s smug expression  perfectly. But her face soon changed, and she became somber and  hushed. “That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about.”</p>
<p>“Oh god, here we go.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing like  that,” she said with a timid smile. “The Director…sort  of…implied that…you were my mother. I mean, you told me that you  see all of your students as family, so…is that what she meant, or…”  Carly sighed forlornly, ran her hand over her face, and glanced at  the floor, her eyes glowing with melancholy.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Evita,”  she whispered. “I meant to tell you before, but…I kept putting it  off. The time never seemed right. What Claes said is true, honey. I’m  sorry I never got around to telling you.” Eve felt tears forming in  her one good eye, and her heart skipped a beat as the news hit her  like a wrecking ball. Incredible!</p>
<p>“So you’re really my  mother?” she whispered, weeping. Carlisle nodded her head. Eve was  glad she was seated; otherwise, she would’ve collapsed.  “That’s…wow, I don’t know what to say. But that means that  Ash and Len…”</p>
<p>“Your half-brother and  half-sister,” she replied. Eve shuddered and let the tears flow.  She covered her mouth, gasping with fright and indescribable  happiness.</p>
<p>“I have a family,” she  squeaked, slowly crumpling. “I really have a family. I have a  brother…a sister…a real mother…and…I suppose…that would  make Jesse my stepfather, wouldn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I guess it would,”  Carly answered softly. She knelt down and took Eve in her arms,  holding her until she could compose herself. Kasberry didn’t  remember ever crying this much; it felt good to release all those  pent-up feelings. When she finally descended from her glorious  height, Eve looked into the eyes of her mentor— her mother— and  decided to pose the next question that had been nagging her.</p>
<p>“Okay, wait, something  doesn’t make sense. Why would a woman like you ever hook up with a  douchebag like my fa…like Senator Kasberry?”</p>
<p>“Honey, that was almost  thirty years ago,” Carly sighed. “I was a different person back  then. I was stupid and selfish. Heh, you could even call me a slut.  In my defense, your father wasn’t nearly the man he is now when I  first met him, but when I got pregnant and had you, he changed  completely. Being the compassionate rich brat he was, he figured a  woman like me would be an unfit mother, and since he also wanted to  avoid the scandal, he used his money and influence to push me outta  the picture and marry some highbred bitch so he could raise you  legitimately. I fought tooth and nail, and I had some of my friends  there with me, but…well, I don’t have to tell you what the  outcome was. For what it’s worth, I didn’t give up the battle  until the very end, when I was forced to leave you behind and start a  new life. God, do I ever regret that. I guess hiring you as my  assistant was just my way of making up for lost time. I hope you can  forgive me, Evita honey.”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry about  that,” Eve murmured, trembling with bittersweet emotion. “That  man’s scum. I hated him for years. The sad part is that I nearly  turned into him. But I finally got outta there and made my way into  the world. I guess fate drew me to this place.”</p>
<p>“Fate, huh? I normally  don’t believe in that shit, but maybe you’re right.” Eve smiled  and wiped her face dry.</p>
<p>“Yeah. So now I have a  family. It’s difficult to wrap my mind around.”</p>
<p>“Give it time,” Carly  said, caressing her long-lost daughter’s hair. “Stay here as long  as you like. It’s your home now.” Eve nodded slowly; the hole  that had been in her heart all her life was now healed, and she felt  cleaner and happier than ever before; her wildest fantasy had come  true. She finally had a place where she belonged.</p>

<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>While the Migelos and the  crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> were working the lunch rush together,  the battle android Zeta stood guard outside, patiently waiting for  his master to return. He knew he didn’t belong in that diner; his  place was in the garage or on the battlefield, not socializing with  humans. But Eve understood him and even loved him; the entire Migelo  family felt the same, and Zeta wondered, with his limited capacity  for imagination, if they shared a bond that went past master and  pupil. Now that he thought about it, the resemblance between Eve and  Mrs. Migelo <em>was</em> rather striking…</p>
<p>Most of the customers that  came into Jesse’s Diner or The Wrench Garage didn’t even notice  Zeta laying hidden in the pile of scrap metal between the two  buildings, so he could safely keep watch without intimidating anyone  or frightening people away. All of the patrons were ordinary folk  anyway, but he had to remain wary for the occasional intruder; it was  part of his programming now. One of the men approaching the twin  establishments set off an alarm, and Zeta carefully studied him,  judging whether he would be a threat or not.</p>
<p>He was very tall and quite  muscular, and bald as an egg. He wore eight swords around his body:  one at each hip, four on his back, and one strapped to each leg. But  most disturbing of all was his choice of dress— that is, <em>A</em> dress, a pink dress with white polka-dots. Transvestites didn’t  usually register as threats, but the eight swords clinched it: Zeta  would not allow weapons into the building. He broke free from his  confines and confronted the strange man.</p>
<p>[Halt. Weapons are not  permitted beyond this point. Please leave them behind if you have any  business here. This is an area of peace and harmony.]</p>
<p>“Wow, a talking tin  man!” the man shouted. “I HAVEN’T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT SINCE  MY TOASTER CAME TO LIFE AND I SMASHED HIS ROTTEN RUSTY BRAINS APART!!  WHAT A DISCOVERY! Hey, wait a second! I don’t listen to rusty old  coppers like you! Heck, I don’t listen to coppers at all! SO YOU  WANT ME TO GET RIDDA MY BABIES?! THEN YOU’D BETTER HAVE A DAYCARE!!  AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Uh, no, wait— that wasn’t a good line.  Let me try again. SO YOU WANT ME TO GET RIDDA MY— ”</p>
<p>BOOM!!</p>
<p>Zeta punched the man in  the head, sending him flying backwards. He whirled gracefully in the  air, landed on his feet, and rubbed his sore temple.</p>
<p>“HEY, DON’T INTERRUPT  ME WHEN I’M MAKING MY THREATS! It’s impolite. NOW FACE THE WRATH  OF MY TEDDY BEAR! AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Uh, crap, I did it again.  Darn my awful lines! DARN THEM ALL TO HECK!!!” The man lunged at  Zeta, drawing four of his swords, two for each hand. In the  nanoseconds before contact, Zeta didn’t think anybody could fight  with four swords at once, yet he felt the blades sinking through his  hard metallic shell, piercing through to the other side; another cut  his right hand off at the wrist, then at the elbow, then at the  shoulder: three strokes in the blink of an eye. The ferocious  cross-dresser kicked Zeta, yelled in pain (comically jumping up and  down as he nursed his bruised toes), and thrust his arm out to smash  whatever was in his way, which just happened to be a plaster swan  advertising a nightclub. Seeing what he did, the man suddenly went  into a hysterical panic.</p>
<p>“OH MY GOD!! I MURDERED  A HELPLESS DUCKY! WHAT A MONSTER I’VE TURNED OUT TO BE! DID YOU SEE  WHAT I JUST DID, CUPCAKE? AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!” He plowed  right into Zeta, all four swords whirling like the blades of a  blender, and not even a Z-95 Executioner-class battle android could  withstand that brutal punishment for very long. Zeta’s body was  flying apart, piece by piece, stabbed and hacked by the man’s  unbelievable power, until finally, his main power units gave out  under the aggression. Eve, Carly, and the others ran out to see what  the commotion was, just in time to witness Zeta’s demise, and  Ferocious’s triumph. He looked up at them and stretched his mouth  out in a sinister grin.</p>
<p>“There was a farmer who  had a dog and <em>BINGO</em> WAS HIS NAME-O! Hey, that was a pretty  good one! NOW DIE SWEETLY, EVERYBODY! AAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!”  In spite of his comical appearance and twisted mind, Ferocious had  earned his name in battle: he was faster, nimbler, and more powerful  than any normal living creature should be. His swords were a hair  away from cutting everyone into tiny chunks when Zeta’s auxiliary  power brought him back to life, and with a dismembered arm, he  grabbed Ferocious by the hem of his dress, threw him back, and  smothered him with his body.</p>
<p>“Zeta!!” Eve called  out to him— master, maker, programmer, precious friend. Zeta stared  at her for a moment, a tender expression almost flashing in his red  eyes.</p>
<p>[Forgive me once again,  Evie, but this is the only way I can protect you. I’m sorry. I just  want you to know that…in the brief time I spent with you…I really  believed I was happiest. Self-destruct sequence activated. T-minus  ten seconds and counting. Advising all non-combatants to seek  shelter. Goodbye, my friend.]</p>
<p>Her screaming and  Ferocious’s struggling meant nothing now. Zeta ran as far away as  he could, and perished in a brilliant blast of fire, shrapnel, and  smoke. Ferocious was thrown back hard, slamming into an empty  building and crashing through a wall. He was burned, bruised, and  bleeding, but still alive; his was made of sterner stuff. As he stood  and brushed himself off, entertaining fantasies of revenge, he  noticed his dress had caught fire, and the strap had broken, so now  his naked chest was exposed.</p>
<p>“EEK!!” he squealed,  covering his shame. “My dress! My beautiful dress! RUINED BY THE  FLAMES OF MY BIRTHDAY CAKE! THE WISH, SHE BACKFIRES!! BUT I’LL BE  BACK— just as soon as I find a tailor. Eep!” And then he picked  himself up and ran fairly for his life.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Eve had once again fallen  into a depression as everyone helped recover the pieces of her brave  friend, but at least now she had a good family and good friends to  fall back on. Sadness and isolation were not so unbearable anymore.  When they gathered as many of the pieces as they could find, ruined  and burned beyond repair, they buried Zeta behind Carly’s garage,  and even prayed for him. Eve silently carved an epitaph and laid  flowers at the tombstone before turning away to rejoin her family,  and to enjoy the chance at life Zeta had given her:</p>
<p align="center">Here lies a  Z-95 Executioner-class battle android</p>
<p align="center">ZETA, MY  FRIEND</p>
<p align="center">He had  thoughts, he had feelings</p>
<p align="center">Therefore, he  was a Person</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Over dinner that night,  Eve announced that she would be leaving in the afternoon tomorrow.  Her family expressed great sorrow and urged her to stay, but Carly  stood up and supported her daughter, because she knew her heart  better than anyone.</p>
<p>“You’re still young,  so of course you shouldn’t be tied down. See the world— see all  the worlds. Fall in love. Break some hearts. Discover your calling in  life— all that mushy crap. And feel free to come back whenever you  need a place to rest your head. There are people who love you very  strongly here, Evita, and don’t you dare forget about it.”</p>
<p>“I won’t,” she  smiled, kissing her mother on the forehead. She embraced brother and  sister both, and hugged Jesse as all daughters should hug their  fathers: unconditionally. “But there’s more to it than that. I  want to find out the truth behind Origin, and who that man was. Once  I have all this settled out, I’m coming back, all right? Just keep  a room open for me.”</p>
<p>“Take your time,”  Carly whispered, giving Eve one last squeeze. “Now get outta here!  You won’t be doing any good staring at our pretty faces! You’re  heading into ugly territory now, kid! Take care, and for heaven’s  sake, find yourself a decent girlfriend! <em>Vian con Dios!</em> But <em>Jesus y Maria</em>,” she muttered to herself, “I can’t  believe my own flesh and blood’s a dyke. She must get that from her  father!”</p>
<p>“I love you too, you old  battle axe!” Eve cried out. Smiling, she turned around and headed  back to the <em>Dauntless</em>.</p>
<p><em>From the bottom of my  heart, I love you…</em></p>
<p><em>Mother.</em></p>
