Elizabeth pushed her way against the flow of people, their pitchforks 
and hatches gleaming against the flickering torches. She clenched the 
little book close to herself in fear that one of them may try to steal 
it from her. She needed the book; needed to stop these people before 
they got to Jamie, needed to put things right and she had a feeling that 
this book was the key to returning everything back to normal. She could 
hear a voice in her head telling her exactly what she must do. She had a 
feeling that it was the book itself that was guiding her way, but did 
not feel any alarm over this fact. After all she just watched as one of 
her friends come back to life after being torn apart by a circus bear 
and another get crushed to a pulp by a giant blob of goo filled with a 
thousand floating eyes. A talking book did seem to fit right in with the 
rest of the insanity and the idea that it might be leading her towards 
misfortune never crossed her mind. 

She finally managed broke through the last mass of bodies to find 
herself in the town square. It was completely devoid of human life as 
the mob dispersed in every direction in search of inhuman things to feed 
their blood lust. Elizabeth glanced down at the book in her hands. It 
trembled with every step she took and she could feel its energy racing 
through her body, filling her mind with the answers that she so dearly 
sought. The book would help her right all the wrongs of the past day. 
Everything would be right. Jamie would be sitting with her while sipping 
a tea with Charles joking about how much of a cute boy Jamie was turning 
out to be. Samuel would come to their rescue and scold the actor for 
treating such fine ladies as themselves in such a rude manner. It would 
be perfect. 

She could feel that she was close to where the book wished to be. She 
was nearing the centre of town and the book began to tremble 
uncontrollably in her hands so much that she needed to hold onto it with 
all her might or it would leap from her arms. As she approached a gazebo 
in the middle of the town park she peered up into the sky. Thick clouds 
gathered overhead, leaving only a circular break in the centre that 
showed a black starry sky and a full moon above. The moon made the 
clouds look like a large dark tunnel in the sky. The twinkling stars 
beaconing Elizabeth to come closer. 

Tentatively she stepped up the stairs of the gazebo. With each footstep 
she felt the wooden floorboards quiver beneath her feet. The gazebo 
itself was charged with energy, the same energy as the book. A mystical 
force grabbed hold of the book and tore it from Elizabeth&#39;s hands. The 
book spiralled through the air and came to a stop in the middle of the 
gazebo, where it hovered several feet above the ground, its cover flung 
open and the pages quickly flipped as if some heavy wind was wiping 
passed it. Abruptly the book stopped on a page and Elizabeth&#39;s eyes 
widened with excitement. This had to be it, the answer to her worries 
were there before her. Everything would turn back to normal and the sun 
would once again shine upon the town. Any remaining fears that she might 
had held vanished at that moment and Elizabeth found herself being drawn 
to the book. She placed her hands upon the pages and was overwhelmed by 
a force washed over her body and mind. She looked upon the glowing words 
before her and began to recite.  

*****

Burnwell wove his way through the main street of Holland-Greystoke 
Township, dragging Charles behind him. &quot;Can... we.... slow down?&quot; 
Charles panted; running was making him exhausted. 

The butler stopped at another intersection and glanced about. Everywhere 
he turned he could see the flickering lights of torches, &quot;Not now!&quot; 
Charles demanded, his panic was growing to a point of hysteria and he 
had a feeling they were running in circles. He usually sent one of the 
servants to town for items and now found himself very lost. &quot;We cannot 
stop with this mad mob on our tail.&quot; He explained anxiously searching 
for the right road to go down. 

&quot;Maybe we can try to talk to them?&quot; Charles offered brightly, &quot;They are 
reasonable people. They will understand that we have done no wrong.&quot; 

&quot;Did you not see the look in their eyes?&quot; Burnwell snapped in 
aggravation, &quot;They are probably being controlled by those circus freaks 
of Morbray&#39;s.&quot; Burnwell muttered in frustration of the situation.

&quot;What is your problem with circuses all of a sudden.&quot; Charles inquired 
perplexed by the man&#39;s strange temperament, &quot;You have been acting rather 
peculiarly since we met today.&quot; 

&quot;This has been a rather peculiar day.&quot; Burnwell remarked simply. 

&quot;There they are!!!&quot; Someone suddenly called out and quicker then 
Burnwell could think the streets filled with angry faces alight by 
flickering torches. 

Burnwell put up his hands in defence, &quot;Now now, why do we not talk this 
over in an intelligent manner.&quot; He offered timidly.

&quot;Now you want to talk to them?&quot; Charles glanced nervously at the way the 
townsfolk pointed sharp implements in their direction, &quot;I do not think 
they wish to have tea, Victor.&quot;

The butler quickly scanned the area as he backed out of range of a 
farmer&#39;s pitchfork, &quot;This would not be a problem if it was not so dark.&quot; 
Burnwell scowled, &quot;I cannot even see where the manor is from here.&quot; He 
frantically stated as he searched the horizon for some sign of the 
building.

Charles moved in closer to the butler as the mob assembled around them, 
&quot;Is that all?&quot; He inquired in disbelief, &quot;It is just down the road to 
the left.&quot; He noted pointing passed one of the smaller gatherings of 
people. 

&quot;Now if we could only get passed them unharmed.&quot; Burnwell stated getting 
increasingly more agitated. 

&quot;Die monster!!!&quot; One of the people cried out and hurled a small hatchet 
at the couple. The blade hit Charles hard in the right shoulder with 
enough force to send the thin actor spinning about and tumble to the 
ground like a rag doll. 

&quot;CHARLES!!!&quot; Burnwell cried out at the sudden death of his lover. 

Charles staggered to his feet, the hatchet jutting violently out of his 
shoulder, &quot;That... really.... hurt...&quot; He declared grabbing the axe and 
wrenching it free of his flesh, causing many of the crowd to back up a 
step or two. He starred at the murderous device unhappily, &quot;That was not 
very nice.&quot; He remarked then glanced at his suit and poked his hand 
through the long slash mark in the fabric, &quot;Now I need to find another 
tailor.&quot;  He muttered displease with the notion and turning on the mob, 
&quot;Do you have any idea how much trouble I went through to get this suit?&quot; 
He inquired angrily, the axe clenched tightly in his hand.

Burnwell staggered backwards, &quot;Ch....Charles?!?&quot; He stammered noticing 
that the actor was not bleeding. The torches shone their light across 
Charles face and for the first time Burnwell noticed the deathly 
appearance of his friend. His face had paled greatly and his eyes held a 
dead look to them. If it was not for the fact that the man was moving 
Burnwell would have thought the man to be ready for the grave, &quot;Wha... 
what ha... happened to you?&quot; The butler shakily inquired, trying to keep 
his knees from knocking in fright. 

Charles cocked his head at the butler, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; He replied 
curiously, taking a step closer to the butler only to have the man 
stumble out of his reach and fall over a stack of barrels &quot;Is there 
something wrong?&quot; He inquired, confused by his lover&#39;s actions. Then 
glanced around to see that even the mob was taken aback by the actor&#39;s 
appearance, or was it the axe Charles was not sure.

The Butler swallowed hard, &quot;Y... you are... dead...&quot; He noted for the 
first time. 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Charles turned the hatchet over in his hands as he 
continued to approach his ex-boyfriend, &quot;I am very much alive. Alive 
enough to remember how you treated me the other day,&quot; He stated with a 
sneer.  The mob parted to give way for the two men as Burnwell crawled 
over the barrels in an attempt to gain some distance between himself and 
his, now psychotic looking, boyfriend.

&quot;N... now Cha... Charles d.. Dear...&quot; The butler stammered, not taking 
his eyes off the gleaming hatchet in the actor&#39;s hands, &quot;I thought we 
went over this.&quot; 

&quot;Oh we did.&quot; Charles agreed, &quot;But you never let me finish. Now that I am 
partly dead I do not have to put up with your attitude problems.&quot; He 
stated bluntly, tapping the blunt end of the hatched upon his palm. &quot;And 
I do not have to worry about these fool&#39;s weapons for I know they will 
have little effect on me.&quot; He grinned maniacally at the mob and raised 
the axe over his head while twirling it madly, &quot;How many of you wish to 
find out if they will return from the dead as I have?&quot; He remarked with 
a menacing glare at the crowd. 

As quickly as they appeared the mob vanished down the streets with 
Charles laughter following at their heels. The sight of his lover wildly 
welding an axe over his head caused Burnwell&#39;s to scramble to his feet 
and flee down another road. Charles stopped laughing and turned his gaze 
on the butler. 

&quot;Now Victor you should not run that way.&quot; Charles stated and gave chase. 

Victor Burnwell turned a corner to find himself facing a rather large 
wall, a dead end. He spun around to see Charles come skidding around the 
corner. &quot;Now Charles do not do anything hasty.&quot; Burnwell said weakly as 
the man approached him, the axe still in his hand. 

&quot;Hasty?&quot; Charles inquired curiously, &quot;Like the way you tossed me away? 
That kind of hast?&quot; He asked eagerly. 

&quot;I am truly sorry.&quot; The butler replied weakly, tears were beginning to 
form in his eyes and he dropped to his knees, &quot;I am Sorrrrrryyyy!!!&quot; He 
cried, clenching at the front of Charles&#39;s tux, &quot;I was rash and curt to 
you, but I regretted ever bit of what I said the moment I cooled down.&quot; 

Charles grabbed the butler by the arm and pulled him to his feet, &quot;Will 
you get to your feet? There is no need to grovel.&quot; 

&quot;Please!!! Do not kill me!!!&quot; Burnwell cried out with his eyes tightly 
clenched shut and his hands clasped together in prayer, &quot;I will be 
good!!! I swear I will never treat you badly again just let me live...&quot; 
He sobbed pitifully.  

&quot;Victor, Will you calm down!&quot; Charles snapped at the butler, &quot;Get a hold 
of yourself. I am not really going to hurt you. It was all an act.&quot; He 
stated, hauling the butler to his feet.

Burnwell opened his eyes to see Charles standing before him, a satisfied 
grin upon his face, &quot;An act?&quot; He asked nervously, a slightly dumbfounded 
expression drawn across his face. &quot;You mean you were just acting the 
whole time?&quot; 

&quot;Not a bad show if I must say so myself, &quot;Charles boosted, setting the 
axe upon his wounded shoulder, &quot;and I never thought I was much for 
improvisational acting myself.&quot; The actor remarked with a chuckle, &quot;And 
you should have seen the way you were grovelling. You really thought I 
was going to kill you.&quot;  His laughter echoed off the walls.

Burnwell let out a sign of relief, &quot;You really had me scared there.&quot; He 
remarked with a nervous chuckle, &quot;I really thought you were dead for a 
moment there. How did you do that trick with the hatch?&quot; He inquired, 
curiously glancing at the ghastly gash in the man&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;What trick?&quot; Charles&#39;s smile broadened, &quot;I was only partly acting.&quot; 
Charles stated bluntly, and then leaned in close to the butler, &quot;I 
really am dead.&quot; He explained nonchalantly, &quot;And I am still angry with 
you for yesterday.&quot; 

The butler simply stared into his lover dead eyes, &quot;B... but.... 
how...?&quot; He stammered in bewilderment.

&quot;I cannot really remember.&quot; Charles replied with a shrug and tossed the 
hatched to the side of the road, &quot;Shall we get to the manor, my love?&quot; 
He took the butlers hand and steered the rather stunned man towards the 
Holland Manor.

*****

Amanda lay in the tub with her eye lightly closed; so much had changed 
in such little time. Discovering that she had been dead for months, that 
her parents would probably never want anything to do with her anymore, 
that she would never be able to live a normal life again. Yet as she lay 
within the warm water within the walls of Castle Greystoke she felt 
relaxed, as if none of the worries could pass beyond those grey 
stonewalls. She opened her eye and stood up. Water poured from her long 
hair and down her back. She began to wring the water from her hair and 
reached for a brush to remove the last of the muck when there was a 
knock at the door. 

&quot;Hello?&quot; Amanda sat back down in the water and covered her chest with 
her arms. 

&quot;Lady Amanda, it is I, Anita.&quot; Anita&#39;s voice drifted from beyond the 
door, &quot;Lady Maria requested that I help you, my lady.&quot; 

Amanda relaxed and lay back in the tub, &quot;Come in Anita.&quot; She called out 
to the maid as she rested her head against the curve at the back of the 
tub. 

Anita entered the room with a towel in her hand, &quot;How is your bath, my 
lady?&quot; Anita inquired as she closed the door behind her and hung the 
towel upon a hook, &quot;Is the water alright, my lady?&quot; 

&quot;It is fine.&quot; Amanda sat up and glanced up at the young maid. She 
noticed that Anita did not flinch away when Amanda looked at the maid, 
unlike the other servants, &quot;You really do not fine us monstrous?&quot; She 
inquired curiously. 

Anita violently shook her head and gazed upon the noble girl&#39;s face, 
&quot;No, My lady!&quot; She replied quickly, her eyes showing no sign of 
betrayal. They held firmly upon Amanda&#39;s and did not flicker away, &quot;I 
think you are beautiful. Almost as beautiful as Lady Maria.&quot; She stated 
with a smile

Amanda cocked her head and gave the maid a peculiar glance, &quot;You do?&quot; 
She inquired leerily, &quot;Why not? We are dead after all.&quot; She looked at 
her pale hands, &quot;Sort of...&quot; 

Maria picked up the brush and knelt beside the tub, &quot;I admit I was 
scared when I first heard of Maria being brought back to life, but I was 
ever so sad when I heard of her death that having her back was like a 
dream come true.&quot; She replied with a slight blush then held the brush 
out, &quot;Would you allow for me to brush your hair?&quot; She inquired shyly. 

Amanda shrank in the tub, &quot;There may still be blood and such.&quot; She 
replied timidly. 

Anita smiled at the girl, &quot;Cannot be as bad as Lady Maria&#39;s was and I 
cleaned out ever bit with as much care as I will yours.&quot; She stated with 
a nod of her head. 

&quot;Al...all right...&quot; Nervously agreed as she Amanda turned in the tub so 
her back was facing the girl. 

Anita gently lifted Amanda&#39;s hair over the edge of the tub and ran her 
fingers through it to remove some of the tangles, &quot;You have lovely hair, 
my lady.&quot; Anita commented as she began to run the brush Amanda&#39;s wavy 
locks. 

Amanda blushed lightly, &quot;My mother never let anyone cut it so it is way 
too long.&quot; She commented curling her legs up in front of herself and 
hugging her knees, &quot;Guess I can never see mother again.&quot; She mumbled 
into her knees. 

Anita stroked the girl&#39;s head with her hand, &quot;I am sorry, my lady.&quot; She 
replied softly. 

Amanda leaned back enjoying the feeling of Anita&#39;s delicate fingers 
through her hair. She forced herself to think of something else to get 
her mind off the feeling, &quot;Do you have a family?&quot; She inquired, trying 
to make conversation. 

Anita stopped in mid stroke, &quot;No.&quot; Anita replied simply, her face long. 

Amanda turned in the tub to look upon the maid&#39;s sad face, &quot;Nope?&quot; She 
asked, eager to learn more, &quot;Do you not miss them?&quot; 

&quot;I was left here when I was only a babe.&quot; Anita replied with a quivered 
smile, &quot;You do not wish to hear of my story, my lady.&quot; She stated, 
shaking the sadness from her mind. 

Amanda slowly shook her head, &quot;I do.&quot; She stated assuredly, setting her 
hand upon Anita&#39;s, &quot;I wish to learn about everyone in my new home. 
Including those that are so dear and close to Maria.&quot; 

&quot;I am no such thing.&quot; Anita remarked modestly, bowing her head. 

&quot;I see the way the two of you look at each other.&quot; Amanda stated 
bluntly, &quot;I saw the way your eyes saddened when you learned of Jamie. I 
can tell your heart ached must worse then my own upon seeing those two 
together. You have lived with her a very long time, have you not?&quot; 

Anita jumped to her feet, &quot;You are wrong, my lady.&quot; She protested 
vigorously, &quot;I am just a simple maid. I could never-&quot; 

&quot;But you do.&quot; Amanda noted, &quot;I can see it in your eyes even now. You do 
not need to hide it from me.&quot; 

Anita sank to the floor, &quot;I do not...&quot; Tears filled her eyes, &quot;I can 
not...&quot; 

Amanda stepped out of the tub and knelt beside the girl, &quot;I am sorry.&quot; 
She wrapped an arm around Anita, &quot;I did not mean to pry.&quot; 

&quot;I love her, my lady.&quot; Anita shakily admitted, &quot;Lady Clara gave her to 
me long ago. She is supposed to be mine and we would be together 
forever.&quot; She sobbed. 

Amanda pulled the crying maid into her arms, &quot;I know.&quot; She frowned, &quot;I 
wish I had a maid like you. Maybe then my life would not have been such 
a nightmare.&quot; 

Anita sniffled and glanced up at Amanda, &quot;Why would you want such a 
disgraceful maid such as I?&quot; She inquired, &quot;I bet you had many maids 
adoring you at your home.&quot; 

Amanda shook her head, &quot;When I was little I made a mistake.&quot; She 
explained miserably, &quot;It is true, my mother also placed a young maid in 
my care. She was sweet and kind to me and I loved her dearly, however 
when I was twelve I did something that I would regret from that day 
onwards.&quot; 

Anita sat up and dabbed at her tears with the edge of her apron, &quot;What 
was that, my lady?&quot; 

Amanda pulling her knees in close to her body and let out a deep sigh, 
&quot;I kissed her.&quot; She stated gloomily, &quot; And the very next day she was 
found to be missing. All that was left behind was a letter explaining to 
my parents what I had done. I was forbidden to be alone with any of the 
young maids ever again.&quot; 

&quot;My Lord!&quot; Anita was shocked by what she heard. &quot;How appalling, I would 
never tell Lady Maria secrets or leave her side. She is dear to me and I 
would do anything to keep her safe. Even from her own parents.&quot; She set 
her hand upon Amanda&#39;s, &quot;Nor would I let anyone harm you, my Lady 
Amanda.&quot; 

Amanda looked into Anita&#39;s eyes, &quot;You are not lying to me? Trying to 
comfort me?&quot; She inquired searching her eyes for any hint of falsehood 
in the maid&#39;s mind, only to fine sincerity in those eyes. 

&quot;I live to serve my lady Maria.&quot; Anita admitted boldly, &quot;And if you 
allow it I would like to serve you as well.&quot; She stated with flushed 
cheeks.

Amanda blinked at the maid in disbelief, &quot;Y... you would?&quot; She blushed 
brightly at the offer, &quot;But...&quot; She placed a hand over her eye only to 
have Anita pull it away. 

&quot;You have no need to hide yourself from me.&quot; Anita assured the girl, 
never letting her eyes weaver from Amanda&#39;s.

&quot;But would you even considering kissing me?&quot; She inquired in a voice no 
more then a whisper. 

Anita let go of the girl&#39;s hand and nervously licked her lips. It has 
been long since she tasted Maria&#39;s lips and she had to admit that she 
longed for one for months. Aside from Amanda&#39;s wounded eye she was quite 
beautiful. Anita swallowed realizing her offer to be Amanda&#39;s servant 
had been taken differently then she intended, or had it? She slowly 
nodded, &quot;If that is your wish of me.&quot; Anita replied softly, her heart 
jack hammering in her chest. 

&quot;I&#39;ve always longed for a true kiss.&quot; Amanda remarked, looking away in 
shame of her request, &quot;You only have to kiss me if that is your so 
desire. I do not wish to force you.&quot; 

Anita quivered with the need, just a taste she thought. She would not be 
betraying her feeling for Lady Maria now would she? She glanced over 
Amanda&#39;s nude form, almost for the first time. The girl&#39;s long, damp, 
hair clung to her in waves over her body, keeping prying eyes from 
getting no more then a glimpse at her slightly exposed skin. The amount 
that Anita could see was enough to send her heart racing as her eyes 
traced the girl&#39;s long smooth arms and legs. She had only see Maria and 
a few of the other servants undressed till this day and the sight of 
such a fair lady sitting nude before her was making Anita feel weak. Her 
heart was only for Lady Maria and yet Lady Maria&#39;s heart was not her&#39;s 
in return. She spent much of the day trying to accept this and now she 
found herself with that feeling rising inside of her again. If she take 
Lady Amanda&#39;s request of a kiss did that mean she no longer loved Lady 
Maria? She could not face the thought of that. 

&quot;Anita?&quot; Amanda could see the battle going on behind the young girl&#39;s 
eyes. She set a hand upon the maid&#39;s cheek, &quot;You do not need to make a 
decision. It was a pathetic request from a lonely girl.&quot; 

Anita looked deep into Amanda&#39;s light green eye. She could see concern 
upon the girl&#39;s face; Amanda did not look to be any intent of harm in 
the girl. No there was something else in that eye. The same look of her 
mistress that very morning, back when Lady Maria thought she would 
forever be alone and shunned for being a monster. Now Lady Maria had 
Jamie, but who could be there for Lady Amanda. Would there be another 
half dead girl in Amanda&#39;s future? Anita did not think so, &quot;It is not a 
pathetic request.&quot; She finally said in but a whisper. 

Amanda did not quite hear what the maid had said and needed to lean in 
closer to the girl, &quot;What was that?&quot; She inquired, not letting her gaze 
free of Anita&#39;s. 

Anita&#39;s lips quivered at their closeness. She could feel Amanda&#39;s breath 
upon her flesh and could no longer resist. She moved quickly, not 
wanting to allow regret or worry to set in again. She placed her lips 
lightly against Amanda&#39;s in a gentle kiss. As sudden as it was Anita 
pulled away in shock of what she did, &quot;I... I am sorry, my la-&quot; She was 
cut off by Amanda returning the kiss, this time much deeper. Warmth 
washed over Anita like nothing before. She could feel Amanda&#39;s hand run 
across her cheek and around the back of her neck. She was so overwhelmed 
by the feel that she let it take over her mind and wrapped her arms 
around Amanda&#39;s neck in a passionate embrace. 

Amanda could feel Anita&#39;s tongue enter her mouth and let her own circle 
around the girl&#39;s. She never thought a kiss could feel so good and so 
warm, it felt as if her entire body had been hungering for this very 
moment all of her life. She gently leaned the maid back and lay atop of 
the girl, never breaking from the kiss. Anita&#39;s finger softly caressed 
her back and butt in ways that sent shivers through Amanda&#39;s entire 
being. She never wanted the moment to end when she felt one of Anita&#39;s 
hands sliding along her stomach and between her legs. Abruptly she cut 
off the kiss and sat up. 

&quot;I... I am sorry...&quot; Amanda was suddenly overcome by a fear. She wanted 
this all of her life and yet this was not how she wanted it to be. 

&quot;My Lady?&quot; Anita watched the girl curiously, &quot;Did I hurt you, My Lady?&quot; 
She asked with concern in her brown eyes. 

Amanda gave the girl a nervous smile, &quot;N... no...&quot; She rubbed at her 
eyes and tucked a lock of hair behind her ear, &quot;I... I just do not know 
if... if I am ready for...&quot; Her eyes darted around the room as she tried 
to piece her confused mind together. 

Anita stood to her feet, picked up the towel off this hook and place it 
over Amanda&#39;s shoulder, &quot;It is alright, My Lady.&quot; She assured the girl, 
&quot;I was afraid the first time Lady Maria did that to me.&quot; She explained 
gently. 

When Amanda looked up there were tears in her eyes, &quot;Did... did it 
hurt?&quot; She inquired tearfully. 

Anita gave the girl a smile, &quot;A little.&quot; She admitted then leaned close 
to Amanda&#39;s ear, &quot;But it was the best thing that happened to me and I 
felt so warm and happy for weeks afterwards.&quot; She picked up the brush 
and knelt behind the girl, &quot;It would an honour be to be the first one to 
do the same with you.&quot; She remarked while running the brush through 
Amanda&#39;s hair. 

Amanda curled her legs up close as she let the maid brush her hair. 
Meanwhile her mind was deep in thought. Reflections of Maria and Anita 
in her mind, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She muttered softly. 

&quot;Anything, my lady.&quot; Anita stated as she gently stroked the girl&#39;s hair, 
&quot;Anything...&quot; 

*****

Victoria brushed a lock of hair over her ear as she tried hard to ignore 
the increasing pace of the winds. She cursed as the winds tried to pull 
the wooden plank out of her hands before she could nail it in place. She 
felt as if nothing was going right for her and she sensed that this 
would be the end of The Raven&#39;s Keep. She did not admit it to anyone 
else but the caf&eacute; had already fallen in the red and the damages to the 
building was not going to help matters, however she was not willing to 
just give up. Running a caf&eacute; was her childhood dream and she was not 
going to let it go until the bitter end. Summoning ever ounce of her 
strength she shoved the piece of wood snug in place with the others and 
was about to drive a nail through the wood when a large furry hand came 
out from behind her and held the piece of wood for her.  

&quot;Let me offer you a hand, Madam.&quot; A deep voice offered from behind 
Victoria.

Victoria starred up at the pair of clawed hands that assisted her then 
glanced around to find herself gazing into a furry wolf like face. The 
first instinct that Victoria had was to run; however as she watched the 
creature it did not seem to have any malice intent in its heart. The 
wolf seemed to ignore her stares as it picked up another piece of wood 
and placed it below the next, then glanced down at her with its bright 
yellow eyes and it ear flicked in a curious manner. 

&quot;I am ready, Ma&#39;am.&quot; The wolf remarked with a slight growl. 

&quot;Th.... thank you...&quot; Victoria stammered, snapping out of her daze to 
quickly nail the boards in place. Only when the window was completely 
covered did Victoria take a step back to get a better look at the 
monster that stood before her. It must have stood over twelve feet tall 
with shoulders wider then two men and dark grey fur that had been 
brushed neatly, &quot;Y... y... you are a werewolf...&quot; 

&quot;Do not let Jacob&#39;s appearance alarm you, young lady.&quot; Came another 
voice from the shadows. Victoria turned to see Morbius standing upon the 
caf&eacute; steps, his cane held firmly in front of him. There were several 
other odd characters standing about the streets, &quot;The name is Morbius 
Morbray and I&#39;m a ringmaster for a local circus.&quot; He explained with a 
smile and a bow. &quot;We were happening by when we spotted that you were in 
a bit of a fix and thought you could use a hand.&quot; 

&quot;Th.... that was very... kind of you...&quot; Victoria continued to stammer 
as she watched Mr. Titter approach the werewolf and together they begin 
to repair the doorframe. 

&quot;We can have this all fixed in but a moment.&quot; Mr. Titter states with a 
giggle and started to juggle pieces of plywood over his head. 

&quot;We can handle things here.&quot; Jacob stated with a grin, or what Victoria 
believed must have been a grin, if a wolf could smile that is. &quot;You have 
other business to take care of inside.&quot; He continued snatching a piece 
of wood from the clown as it nearly hit him in the muzzle.  

&quot;Other business?&quot; Victoria inquired, completely baffled by what she was 
seeing. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Morbius took the hammer from Victoria&#39;s hands and passed it to 
one of the other circus folk, then took the woman by the hand and 
started to lead her into the caf&eacute;, &quot;We have much to talk about. You 
would not have some tea to drink while we converse now would you?&quot; He 
inquired taking a quick look at his watch, &quot;We seemed to have missed our 
tea time.&quot;

 &quot;Uhhhh... yes... I can make you some.&quot; Victoria offered with a nervous 
smile. 

&quot;We were afraid you would never ask.&quot; Morbius stated with a wide grin, 
&quot;That is awfully nice of you.&quot; And before Victoria was aware of what had 
occurred she found herself being host to a horde of the strangest 
creatures in existence.
