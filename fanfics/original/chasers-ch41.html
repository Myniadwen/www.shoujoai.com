<a href="../original/chasers-ch40.html">Back to Part 40</a><pre>Jennifer Grayson blinked at the packages on her desk,
all wrapped fairly inexpertly in festive designs.
Hanging up her coat the stylishly dressed blonde
walked over to look at them thoughtfully, noting that
there were four of them, from Gwen, Beth, Kate and
Julie.

&#39;Glad I dropped off my gifts in the other&#39;s offices
already,&#39; Jen thought with amusement, gently picking
up and turning over the packages. She was tempted to
just open them now, but she firmly held back, deciding
it was best to wait.

Beth Harris stuck her head in the door, the little
redhead wearing the cutest little Santa hat. &quot;Hey
Jen,&quot; she said cheerfully, &quot;Merry Christmas.&quot;

&quot;Merry Christmas,&quot; Jen repeated with a laugh. She
looked at her thoughtfully, &quot;I haven&#39;t checked in with
my computer, any trouble yet?&quot;

&quot;Yet?&quot; Beth chuckled. She smiled as she perched on the
corner of Jen&#39;s desk, her mini-skirt ridding up a bit,
&quot;Well, Kate&#39;s left a message she&#39;ll be in a bit
later,&quot; she relayed, &quot;but other than that I think
we&#39;re good.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Jen logged on, quickly calling up the active
case hierarchy on her screen. As she read she asked,
&quot;Any problems with the regular police services?&quot;

&quot;Couple of reports on minor android incidents,&quot; Beth
said, &quot;we&#39;re keeping an eye on them.&quot;

&quot;We as in, our computer wizzes Beth and Julie?&quot; Jen
smiled slightly as she teased, &quot;Or we as in, you and
Gwen?&quot;

A pink tint colored Beth&#39;s cheeks. &quot;We as in me and
Julie, thank you,&quot; she said with as much dignity as
she could muster.

Jen looked at her with gentle amusement then said
reassuringly, &quot;If you and Gwen are trying to keep this
quiet, that&#39;s fine. I won&#39;t bring it up again.&quot;

Beth smiled back a bit self-mockingly, &quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m
just... not used to this.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Jen looked curious.

Beth looked thoughtful as she admitted, &quot;I&#39;ve been a
flirt, and I know I dated around a lot... but this
feels like something more.&quot;

&quot;And I think you two are good for each other,&quot; Jen
said cheerfully.

&quot;I think so, too,&quot; Beth laughed. She looked at Jen
thoughtfully, &quot;So, when are you going to do something
about Kate?&quot;

Jen grinned, &quot;Trust me, I&#39;m trying.&quot;

A soft rap on the door and they both looked up to see
Gwen Musashi standing there, a faintly amused look on
her face. The elegantly dressed, poised woman looked a
bit odd wearing a red and white Santa hat, but it
really was cute. &quot;Don&#39;t ask,&quot; she said firmly as both
Beth and Jen looked ready to question the hat.

&quot;I&#39;ll get it out of you later,&quot; Beth warned.

&quot;I don&#39;t doubt it,&quot; Gwen chuckled. She looked at Jen
thoughtfully, &quot;Are you visiting your family this
Christmas?&quot;

&quot;As much as I&#39;d like to avoid it, yes,&quot; Jen sighed.

&quot;You&#39;re still having problems with your family?&quot; Beth
asked sympathetically. She frowned in memory, &quot;You
came out to them recently, is that it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a problem, but not in the way that you think,&quot;
Jen sighed.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Gwen asked as Beth looked on curiously.

&quot;Mother&#39;s back to arranging these marriage meetings,&quot;
Jen groaned, &quot;this time with suitable women!&quot; She
looked up with a pained expression, &quot;I&#39;m almost scared
to go home, wondering what sort of dog she&#39;s going to
try to hook me up with next!&quot;

Beth looked at her blankly a moment, then began to
laugh, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she wiped at her eyes, &quot;I was just
imagining what some of those meetings must be like.&quot;
Even Gwen was fighting back a smile, her eyes
twinkling.

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Jen sighed. She smiled faintly, &quot;So
where did Kate go, anyway?&quot;

&quot;She had an appointment,&quot; Gwen said calmly, &quot;then said
she&#39;d check in with a contact in Lowtown. She should
be back in a few hours.&quot;

Unaware that she was a topic of conversation Kate
Williams bolted up from the comfortable chair, then
the sandy haired woman restlessly paced across the
room. &quot;What is this?&quot; she demanded fiercely, &quot;Why do
you have to keep asking me these stupid questions?&quot;

Dr. Alexis Jameson remained seated, the black haired
woman looking up at her calmly. &quot;Because like most
police officers you&#39;d rather be doing the
questioning,&quot; she said mildly, &quot;repeating the question
seems to be the only way to get a straight answer out
of you.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Kate conceded, her lips twisted in a
uncomfortable smile. She stood by the windows, her
back visibly tense as she looked out at the gray
towers of the city, the color matching the clouds
above them.

&quot;How do you think your parent&#39;s death,&quot; Alexis
repeated the question to Kate gently, &quot;has influenced
your life?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t trust intelligent machines or artificial
intelligences,&quot; Kate finally conceded reluctantly.
After Alexis prompted her Kate continued, &quot;Machines
can go wrong so damn easily... they save the same
flaws as their builders. And because of that, people
can get hurt.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re scared of being hurt?&quot; Alexis suggested.

&quot;I am not scared!&quot; Kate nearly shouted, eyes flashing.

&quot;That&#39;s a strongly defensive reaction, Kate,&quot; she
said, Alexis trying to keep her tone
non-confrontational and soothing.

&quot;I&#39;m not scared,&quot; Kate repeated a bit more quietly,
&quot;at least, not for myself. But I don&#39;t think I could
bear to lose another loved one to some damn machine&#39;s
error.&quot;

Alexis had to fight down her obvious jubilation at
that comment, knowing a breakthrough when she saw it.
Deciding now was not the time to push her she shifted
to generalities, giving Kate a bit of time to catch
her emotional breath.

&quot;You&#39;d make a good cop,&quot; Kate sighed as she got ready
to go a little while later.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Alexis asked with a smile.

&quot;You have the questioning techniques down pat,&quot; Kate
grinned and Alexis laughed. &quot;Oh,&quot; Kate rummaged
through a shoulder bag she had brought, &quot;here.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t need to...&quot; Alexis looked at the rather
badly wrapped gift Kate had given her.

&quot;It didn&#39;t cost much, trust me,&quot; Kate said dryly. A
sudden smile appeared, &quot;I just saw it and instantly
thought of you.&quot;

After Kate had gone Alexis sat down, glad that the
mercurial woman was the last appointment on her
calendar that day. She smiled as she turned the gift
over in her hands, considering if she should go to the
party Christa and the others from the Android rights
movement were organizing, or maybe drop in to see her
family.

&quot;Oh what the hell,&quot; she muttered, giving into
temptation Alexis tore at the wrapping, getting a bit
of tape on her hands as she opened the gift.

The mug was a simple one, a bit old fashioned, and
there was writing on the side. &#39;You don&#39;t have to be
crazy to work here,&#39; it said simply, &#39;but it helps.&#39;
Alexis began to laugh as she set it down, right dead
center of her desk.

&quot;That woman,&quot; Alexis shook her head smiling, &quot;will be
the death of me.&quot;

Probably well aware of the mirth her gift was causing
Kate finished off her last errand, dropping off a gift
for Silver, too. Technically she shouldn&#39;t have done
it on work time, but she figured Gwen would forgive
her that.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Silver murmured, cradling the
crystal figure thoughtfully. She looked up at Kate,
the nearly archetypal tough cop and added, &quot;Not what I
expected.&quot;

Kate smiled back, &quot;I try to surprise people, if I
can.&quot;

&quot;Would you like to come in?&quot; Silver asked, looking at
Kate with a thoughtful expression.

Kate shook her head no regretfully, &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m still
on the clock for work right now.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;Do
you have plans for tonight?&quot;

Silver smiled, reaching out to touch Kate&#39;s arm, &quot;No,
I was only going to see Kari and she&#39;s off with her
family tonight.&quot; Teasingly, &quot;What&#39;s the offer?&quot;

Kate chuckled, &quot;Dinner, maybe dancing?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Silver smiled.
