<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 20 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Jenn sat upon the toilet, deep in thought. She was sure that she had 
seen something in the way Jessica and Kris were looked at each other, 
but was not sure if it was her imagination. Something inside of her 
boiled over the idea of Jessica going near her Kris, she tried to shake 
the idea from her mind. She did not think that Kris would do anything of 
the sort, but she did not trust Jessica. Sure the girl was kinds and 
helpful, yet sometimes she came across as very sexual. Jenn was not sure 
if she could trust Jessica with Kris and she grinded her teeth as the 
image of the two of them snuggling flickered through her mind. She shook 
her head again. She was not the jealous type so why was she acting this 
way. Her mind turned to May and the way the girl would treat anyone who 
showed an interest in Jenn. Was she reacting the same way as May would? 
She was only thinking of what was right for Kris... wasn&#39;t she?	

She groaned in pain as she dug in one of the shopping bags that she 
brought with her and opened a new box of tampons. The cramps had been 
steadily increasing in intensity and it was putting Jenn in an even 
fouler mood.  She inserted the tampon with more ease then that morning, 
pulled up her panties and fixed her skirt before flushing the toilet and 
exiting the stall. She found Tanya sitting on the counter with her legs 
swinging back and forth, &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting.&quot; Jenn apologized as 
she crossed the room to drop the remains of the tampon in the garbage 
and wash her hands.  

&quot;No problem.&quot; Tanya remarked, &quot;How are you feeling?&quot; She inquired deeply 
concerned. 

Jenn glanced into the mirror to see May&#39;s face staring back at her with 
a bloody stained grin. Jenn staggered backwards in shock only to see 
that it was her own face that was staring back at her. 

&quot;You alright?&quot; Tanya inquired, jumping off the counter to look into the 
mirror, &quot;Did you see something?&quot; 

Jenn blinked at her reflection, lightly touched one of the cuts on her 
face and wincing in pain, &quot;Is that really me?&quot; She asked staring at the 
thin trails of blood upon her face. She pulled her blouse open to see 
more claw marks across her chest, &quot;I look like a nightmare.&quot; She noted 
uneasily, her mind jumped to Kris and thought of how the girl would 
think of all these cuts and she let out a deep sigh.

&quot;Nothing a little water won&#39;t clear up.&quot; Tanya assured grabbing a paper 
towel and soaking it in the sink, &quot;Here.&quot; 

Jenn turned to face her friend, allowing the girl to dab at the wounds. 
&quot;Ouch!&quot; She recoiled. 

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Tanya flinched back, &quot;Maybe you should do it. I&#39;m no good at 
this kind of thing.&quot; She admitted guiltily. 

&quot;Thanks for trying.&quot; Jenn turned on the faucet and splashed water upon 
her face, clenching her teeth against the way the water stung against 
her skin. She reached out blindly in search of the paper towels to have 
Tanya hand her a couple. 

&quot;Here.&quot; Tanya offered placing the dry towels in the girl&#39;s hands. 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Jenn dabbed at her face and peeked at herself in the mirror to 
find that most of the cuts were superficial and washed away leaving a 
few marks here and there, the remaining ones looking as if a crow had 
attacked her. She unbuttoned her blouse and dabbed at the last few 
scratched, glad that she had chosen to wear a black shirt instead of 
white, before tossing out the paper towel. &quot;Let&#39;s go Tanya.&quot; Jenn 
commanded popping a few painkillers in her mouth, filling a paper cup 
with water and downing it. She picked up her shopping bags and her 
jacket before heading out of the washroom

Tanya sprung to her friend side, &quot;Coming.&quot; She replied and fell into 
step beside Jenn. Together they entered the lobby and headed for the 
doors out of the dorm.

&quot;Where do you think you are going?&quot; Kris demanded from near the office 
door as Jenn strolled passed her.						

&quot;Tanya asked for my help with Cherilyn.&quot; Jenn explained simply, &quot;Tanya, 
did you get your forms signed?&quot; She asked her friend.

&quot;Y... yes...&quot; Tanya answer and pulled out the pink paper from her back 
pocket.

&quot;Do you think that is a good idea?&quot; Kris stated even more concerned for 
the girl after seeing the stat she just came out of, &quot;Amy should be down 
soon. You should let her look you over first.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; Jenn replied bluntly and with an edge that Kris had not hear 
aimed at her before. Kris flinched at Jenn&#39;s tone causing Jenn to 
reconsider her tone, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I worried you, but I can&#39;t just sit 
around here.&quot; 

&quot;But-&quot; Kris was about to protest when there was a crashing sound from 
inside the office that made her spin around to face it. Jessica had 
pulled the blinds shut so no one could see what she was up to and this 
was adding to Kris&#39;s anxiety. Why did her Aunt have to leave her in 
charge at a time like this?

&quot;Good luck with your new position.&quot; Jenn scoop up her other shopping 
bags near the couches, and then pushed through the doors without waiting 
for Kris&#39;s reply, &quot;I&#39;ll see you later.&quot;

Tanya gave Kris a hard glare as she passed the girl and she followed 
after Jenn.

&quot;Why does this always have to happen to me?&quot; Kris muttered in distress.

&quot;Kris?&quot; Kima approached the girl cautiously. 

&quot;What is it?&quot; Kris snapped, quickly regretting her actions when she saw 
the hurt look on the redhead&#39;s face, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She rubbed her head, 
&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to snap.&quot; 

Kima shook her head and smiled, &quot;It&#39;s alright. Things have been 
stressful after all.&quot; She then turned to glace at the office, &quot;I&#39;m just 
worried about Jessica. Is she going to be alright?&quot;

&quot;That is what I am going to find out.&quot; Kris replied hopefully as she 
crossed the lobby, &quot;You keep an eye on Penny in case she finally wake 
up.&quot; She stated to Kima, who was already heading back to the girl&#39;s 
side. Kris stopped at the office door and let out a sign, this was 
turning out to be quite the morning. She knew that the morning&#39;s silence 
was too good to be true. Everything had to come apart sooner or later, 
but did it all have to be at once? 

&quot;Jessie?&quot; Kris asked the door softly then followed with a light knock. 

&quot;Go away!&quot; Jessica demanded from behind the door. 

&quot;No!&quot; Kris replied, &quot;I am not leaving you. You told me that you would be 
there for me and I&#39;m telling you the same.&quot; No answer came from within 
the office. 

Amy came down the stairs at that moment and glanced around the nearly 
empty room, &quot;Where is everyone?&quot; She inquired with bewildered concern. 

&quot;Amy!!&quot; Kris rushed over to the doctor, &quot;I am so glad to see you.&quot; 

&quot;What is wrong now?&quot; Amy had a feeling she knew; she had noted the 
moment she arrived that there was something going on between Kris and 
Jessica and the fact that Jessica was nowhere in sight only meant only 
one thing. &quot;Let me guess. It is Jessie?&quot; 

Kris nodded, &quot;Aunt Missy lost it all of a sudden and told Jessie that 
she was not leaving and that she was being removed as Dorm Head and 
well...&quot; 

Amy shook her head in dismay, &quot;That is what I was fearing. I should have 
known.&quot; She muttered as she followed Kris to the office door. 

&quot;What?&quot; Kris inquired curiously. 

&quot;It was about time for Missy to have an explosion.&quot; Amy remarked with a 
sign, &quot;You girls are not the only ones with problems at this school. I 
sometimes wonder why Missy was given charge of the Western Dorms 
considering how attached she gets to you girls.&quot; She explained then 
stopped at the office door, placed a hand upon the door and closed her 
eyes. A deep sensation of guilt, shame and disgust permeated from beyond 
the door causing Amy frown profoundly. She glanced up at Kris who was 
standing apprehensive over her. She forgot how tall Kris was in 
comparison and she was taken a back by the girl for a moment and needed 
to centre herself before speaking, &quot;Are you ready for what you may see 
behind this door?&quot; She inquired, searching Kris&#39;s eyes for any sign of 
hesitation. 

Kris gave a firm nod, &quot;She has been watching over me so much since I got 
here.&quot; Kris explained anxiously, &quot;I want to return the favour. I want be 
there for her.&quot; 

&quot;You have to want more then to just be there for her.&quot; Amy explained 
hesitantly, &quot;You need to want to help her with every part of your heart 
because Jessica&#39;s issues are darker then many of the girls here. She may 
not look it but there is a shattered soul within the strong facade.&quot; 

&quot;What happened to her?&quot; Kris asked with concerned curiosity. 

Amy turned to the door, &quot;That is for her to tell you.&quot; She touched the 
doorknob lightly and it clicked, &quot;When we enter I want you to do exactly 
what I say. I do not know how far she has crumbled but things could be 
rather bad.&quot; With that she opened the door and upon stepping within the 
tiny office a wave of darkness rushed passed them. Amy easily throw off 
the feelings at they tried to cling to her heart, Kris however was 
doubled over in agony as the darkness tried to eat at her already 
weakened soul. 

&quot;Hold together.&quot; Amy demanded coolly, &quot;You said you wanted to be there 
for Jessica and if you can&#39;t fight passed the emotions that haunt her 
then what use will you be.&quot;

Kris clenched her teeth, &quot;Get away from me!!!&quot; She screamed and tossed 
the darkness off of her heart and mind. 

&quot;Are you going to be alright?&quot; Amy asked slightly concerned for the 
girl. 

&quot;I fought my way through the Wood more then once.&quot; Kris reminded as she 
straightened up again, &quot;I will not allow anything to keep me from 
helping my friends.&quot; She explained boldly. 

&quot;Good.&quot; Amy nodded, She turned on a small flashlight that she kept in 
her pocket and shone it around the room.

There was water all over the floor and broken glass scattered about, the 
sight of which sent Kris&#39;s heart racing in panic. All she could see was 
the image of Jenn lying on the ground with a shard of glass in her hand 
and pools of blood spewing forth from her wrists. She quickly glanced 
around the gloom to make sure none of her sisters were about. The circle 
of light finally came across Jessica shaking in the corner.

&quot;Jessie!!&quot; Kris carefully moved around the mess until she was at the 
girl&#39;s side. Jessica seemed to shrink away from Kris as if she did not 
know who she was, her eyes held a vacant look to them. Kris scanned the 
girl to see that there was a bottle of rubbing alcohol lying at the 
girl&#39;s feet and she was rubbing at her arms while rocking in place and 
mumbling under her breath. Her nails had already ripped away some of the 
skin from her forearm causing beads of blood to form on her skin and 
droplets to mix with the water and alcohol at their feet. Kris picked up 
the bottle and stared at it uneasily. 

Amy seemed to know what Kris was thinking, &quot;She would not drink it so do 
not worry.&quot; She remarked setting her bag on the counter and digging 
through it. 

&quot;Then what did she do?&quot; Kris glanced around the mess, &quot;What was she 
thinking?&quot; She inquired glancing into her friend&#39;s eyes, which were 
glazed over and not even aware of their presence. 

Amy pulled out a needle and knelt next to Jessica, &quot;She was trying to 
clean herself.&quot; She stated taking the girl&#39;s arm with no resistance and 
plunging the needle into her arm, &quot;She sometimes thinks she is dirty and 
tries to scrub the dirt clean.&quot; 

Kris suddenly recalled the girl&#39;s very words in their room. &#39;No one 
could ever love someone as dirty as me.&#39; She did not understand what 
Jessica was meaning until now. Her heart stirred as she tried to fathom 
what could have happened to her friend to cause her to be so troubled. 

Amy dropped the needle back in the bag. &quot;Help me get her out of here.&quot; 
She asked taking one of Jessica&#39;s arms, what ever it was that Amy had 
given Jessica seemed to be already taking effect because she did not 
resist as Kris helped Amy carry the girl out of the office and to a 
couch. 

&quot;Is she alright?&quot; Kima asked quietly, noticing that Jessica was drifting 
off to sleep. 

&quot;She will be fine.&quot; Amy replied, gently setting the girl&#39;s head upon the 
cushions, &quot;She is strong. She has lived this long without anyone and now 
that she has people who cares for her she will surely get better.&quot; Amy 
beamed down at Kris.

&quot;Wha?&quot; Kris blushed at what Amy was issuing. 

Amy patted Kris on the shoulder; &quot;Jessie has been talking about you 
since your first appearance. I am glad to see you show the same concern 
for her. I just hope that Jenn is able to handle the heart break.&quot; 

&quot;I could even tell she loves you the moment I met her.&quot; Kima remarked 
with a smile. 

Kris found herself speechless.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; Kima stated, &quot;I will not tell anyone.&quot;

Kris lowered her head and gazed upon Jessica&#39;s sleeping face, &quot;What am I 
to do?&quot; She inquired, unsure of how to handle the situation. 

&quot;You&#39;ll think of something.&quot; Amy glanced around the room then at the 
office, &quot;Maybe I will stick around for a bit. The office needs a 
cleaning and I should be here when these two wake up.&quot; She explained, &quot;I 
need to get a crutch for Alyson first, and some more bandages for 
Jessica, but will be back quickly.&quot; She turned to Kris, &quot;Is that alright 
with you?&quot; 

Kris nodded, not able to take her eyes off of Jessica, &quot;Thank you for 
everything.&quot; She said gratefully. 

&quot;Not a problem.&quot; Amy said with a smiled then quickly raced out of the 
dorm in search of the things she would need.
