<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 3 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Kris opened her eyes and looked up at the sky. The memories of her 
elementary school days fresh in her mind. Clouds could be seen slowly 
moving across a perfectly blue sky. The kind of weather that she enjoyed 
curling up under a tree with Jenn. Kris looked down at the flower on her 
lap and remembered where she was. It was no longer the past and Jenn 
would no longer be at her side. Kris&#39;s heart felt weak and she needed to 
use the corner of the bench to help herself stand. Only when she was 
certain her legs were not going to give out on her, did she continue her 
journey down the road. 

It did not take her long to reach her destination. Kris found herself 
walking alongside a large cemetery. As the entrance appeared in the 
distance Kris could feel herself begin to tremble. It had been such a 
long time since she had visited this place. Something about cemeteries 
held a calming feeling to them. She felt at peace amongst the headstones 
and would go for long walks with Jenn on cool autumns nights. Kris 
entered through the grand gateway and started down the many paths. There 
was a time when she and Jenn would get lost in the winding paths. They 
would walk around the graves until the sun went down. Kris smiled as she 
remembered the many autumns that were spent here.

She wove her way through the cemetery until she came to a stop at a 
small gravestone. She knelt and brushed some of the dirt off the stone. 
Upon the headstone was a inscription. &#145;Jennifer Halley - 1974 ~ 1990.  
She will always be remembered as our beloved daughter.&#39; 

Kris reached out and traced the letters with her finger, &quot;Hello there. 
Been a while hasn&#39;t it?&quot; She mumbled, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m sorry I have been 
away so long. I really didn&#39;t mean to... I....&quot; Tears filled her eyes as 
she clenched onto the flower tighter, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; She let out a 
short sob. She could no longer keep herself from crying. She clenched 
her stomach as a wave of tears overflowed and splashed against the 
inside of her sunglasses, before rolling to the earth. She sat with her 
back against the headstone, pulled out a small notebook and began to 
write.

She was told it would be best for her to start writing her feelings down 
instead of letting them build up inside of her. At first she found this 
a stupid idea, however over time she found herself turning more and more 
to her little notebook whenever she was upset and alone. Kris wrote 
quickly and without any concern for who would read it. Words spilled out 
over the pages in a jumble of unconscious thought. 

	&quot;Death, a world of silence and tranquillity. No worries to think 
of or problems to ponder. I think of these things here amongst the 
headstones. Time slowly passing by as I sit among the dead in their 
trouble less slumber, I consider joining them.

	Before me lies my lost love, Blanketed by mother earth. I feel the 
cold steel press hard upon my wrist, the pain must be stopped, the 
sorrow must no longer be, Death seems the only way, I shall soon sleep 
an endless slumber.

	But the evil within fights me, rips at my mind and soul, Killing 
the sanity That hides deep inside, smashing my head hard to regain some 
control, I&#39;ve already lost some time ago, When I Lost Her...&quot;

They were out celebrating Jennifer&#39;s 16th birthday. The air was cool and 
the wind played with the girls&#39; hair. The two had just left the evening 
matinee and decided to enjoy the fresh air before calling it a night. 
Jennifer wore a long flowing white summer dress that danced in the wind. 
Kris was always mesmerized by Jennifer&#39;s sheer grace and beauty. 
Jennifer smiled at the way Kris would watch her move. She always found 
it amusing the way Kris would silently take in every detail of her. Kris 
could never understand what this girl saw in her. Her looks paled in 
comparison to Jenn&#39;s. Dressed in black slacks and a white silk top that 
were to big for her and covered up any form of feminine body that Kris 
might have. Jennifer laced her hands behind her back, leaned over, and 
kissed Kris softly on the lips. Kris felt her arms move uncontrollably 
as they encircled the girl and pulled her tight into her embrace, 
deepening the kiss.

&quot;It&#39;s getting late,&quot; Jenn said as she pulled away from the kiss, &quot;I 
should get home before mom gets upset. You know how much she worries.&quot; 
She fixed Kris&#39;s collar as she spoke.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kris was saddened by the thought of the evening ending so early, 
all the same it was a school night after all, &quot;We don&#39;t want to worry 
mom, now do we?&quot; Kris felt closer to Jenn&#39;s mother than her own. While 
she didn&#39;t really care what her own mother was thinking she would never 
go against Jenn&#39;s mom. 

Jenn looked around and pointed at a small park across the road, &quot;Why 
don&#39;t we cut through the park. We can catch the bus faster on the other 
side.&quot; Jenn started to pull Kris towards the park. 

Kris looked up at the sky. It was getting really dark and something 
about the park frightened her, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She ventured pulling on 
Jenn&#39;s hand, &quot;Maybe we should just catch the bus at the mall.&quot;

&quot;You always worry to much.&quot; Jenn answered, &quot;and you did say you would do 
whatever I wanted to today.&quot; She continued with a grin. She loved to 
walk hand in hand through the park and felt it would be a perfect end to 
the day. 

&quot;Well...&quot; Kris tried to think of a way to protest, however one look into 
those eyes and she was lost. She was never very good at arguing with the 
girl she had given her heart to at such a young age, &quot;If you insist.&quot; 
Kris let herself be pulled along the park path, only pretending to 
protest. The two girls laughed as they playfully teased each other.

They didn&#39;t get very deep into the park when a group of boys stepped out 
of the shadows. One of them grabbed for Jennifer. Kris was quick to pull 
her out of his reach. Everything became a blur as one of the boys landed 
a blow to Kris&#39;s side. She heard her lover scream out as another blow 
struck Kris again, this time with a bat. The pain didn&#39;t matter. All she 
cared about was getting to Jennifer, when again she was struck in the 
back of the neck and she fell to the ground as darkness washed over her.

Kris was awakened by raindrops pelting her face. She slowly rose to find 
that most of her clothes had been torn and only one sleeve of her blouse 
still remained intact. Nevertheless she didn&#39;t care about that. The 
first thing that came to her mind was Jenn; she prayed that her love was 
unharmed. They could beat Kris until there was nothing left, but there 
would be no reason left to live for if her love was no longer standing 
at her side. Kris got to her feet with the aid of a nearby tree (which 
was odd in itself because she remembered being knocked down on the 
pavement, but she didn&#39;t bother with that.); she stumbled around the 
park, ignoring the pain in her ribs and the blood that was trickling 
down the side of her now swollen right eye.

&quot;Just let her be all right, let her have escaped unharmed, that is all I 
ask,&quot; However Kris&#39;s wish fell on deaf ears as she soon stumbled upon 
the limp form of her love lying broken near the roots of an old willow 
tree. Kris knew right away that there was no hope, but couldn&#39;t, 
wouldn&#39;t, let go of the faint chance she was wrong, and Jennifer was 
just peacefully sleeping under the stars.

Kris dropped to her knees upon reaching the other girl&#39;s side. Shakily 
she reached out and touched Jennifer&#39;s soft cheek. It was cold. &quot;Jenny, 
Hey Princess it is time to wake up.&quot; But there came no answer.

&quot;No no no no,&quot; Kris began to say over and over again. She pulled the 
limp lifeless figure that was once her lover&#39;s body into her arms and 
began to rock back and forth. All the physical pain she had felt before 
was replaced by a sorrow that she couldn&#39;t control and finally Kris let 
out an anguished scream.
