<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 39 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch38.html">Back to Part 38</a><pre>      &quot;So this whole entire time, we were running around thinking the world was going to end 
while you were completely in control of everything?&quot; Abby&#39;s statement basically summed up 
the whole conversation.

      &quot;Yep,&quot; Tsuru said, nodding. &quot;When the power of the Demon Lord first entered my body it 
was pretty easy to wrestle with it and gain control of myself. At first, I planned to merely 
reject it and spit in the face of Hoshi&#39;s offer.&quot;

      Speaking of which, the three sisters were asleep in separate rooms, exhausted from 
both the curse and their actions against the despairing souls. Carmilla calmly stirred her 
tea, a slight pout on her face. So far, Tsuru had eyes for no one but Krystal...

      &quot;But what made you change your mind?&quot; Erin asked.

      &quot;Well, along with the power, I got some of the memories of the other Demon Lords. I 
realized that if I cast out the entity in my body, Hoshi would run off and we&#39;d never find 
her again. I figured that I could end this madness by simply playing the part.&quot;

      Isaka spoke up. &quot;So you kicking the crap out of me was just you &#39;playing the part&#39;?&quot;

      Tsuru just smiled fondly, before continuing on without answering her question. &quot;I had 
to keep up the act unless I wanted Hoshi to catch on... but I didn&#39;t realize that the curse 
made her totally obedient until much later. I decided that I was going to use Krystal and 
her power to help me purify those lost souls.&quot;

      Josh let out a slight laugh. &quot;Of course... any exorcist would love a chance to take 
care of such a source of evil.&quot;

      Krystal giggled as well. &quot;I thought she was totally taken over by the Demon Lord until 
after I defeated Hoshi. She then explained it all to me and asked me to help her.&quot;

      Tsuru let out a sigh. &quot;It was so stressful being such a jerk. I had to count on Hoshi 
getting frantic when Krystal tried to bring her to terms about her sisters and by the time 
she was knocked out, I was able to get a chance to tell Krystal the truth. In reality, I was 
being watched the whole time by those souls in the pit... they got excited once I began to 
release them, so they were too distracted to notice what I was telling Krystal.&quot;

      Everyone in the group took a moment to contemplate it all. Faye adjusted her baseball 
cap. &quot;Well, you all had us duped... and we worked into your plan perfectly.&quot;

      Eveon sighed. &quot;Well it&#39;s nice that this is all over... so do you still have the power 
of the Demon Lord, or...?&quot;

      Tsuru shrugged. &quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m in complete control so I think it&#39;s better for me to 
hold on to it. If I release the Demon Lord&#39;s power out into the world, someone evil may come 
along to try and use it. It&#39;s safe with me.&quot;

      Isaka snorted. &quot;Yeah, right. You probably just want to keep it so you can kick the 
crap out of me...&quot;

      Tsuru smiled. &quot;Of course. I was finally able to beat you-&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, well you were practically having an asthma attack in the pit.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s because I used up all my energy breaking the seal... and I still put up a good 
fight.&quot;

      &quot;Demon Lord... bah, Tsuru you are like a flipping smorgasbord of magical creatures. 
Why don&#39;t you fuse with a harpy and get yourself some wings while you&#39;re at it?&quot;

      &quot;...did you just change the subject because you couldn&#39;t think of a good comeback?&quot;

      &quot;Shut it, Tsuru. Why don&#39;t you go cuddle up with Carmilla instead of bothering me?&quot;

      Tsuru turned and looked at said vampire who only gave her a toothy grin. A moment of 
silence passed before Tsuru said, &quot;I&#39;m good, thanks.&quot;

      Carmilla dropped her head in disappointment and Seth awkwardly patted her on the back.

      Abby got up suddenly and stretched. &quot;Well, I think me and Sakura are going to go check 
in on those girls... we&#39;ll go see Hina first.&quot; The angel beside her got up as well.

      Erin and Faye exchanged glances before the red head said, &quot;Then we&#39;ll go see Tsuk-&quot;

      &quot;Wait a second!&quot;

      &quot;No you&#39;re not!&quot;

      &quot;Like we&#39;re going to let you!&quot;

      The three respective simultaneous cries from Krystal, Tsuru and Isaka stopped Faye&#39;s 
words in her mouth. Tsuru cleared her throat and spoke. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to 
let the two of you go check up on a sleeping teenaged girl.&quot;

      Erin gave her a confused look. &quot;Why? We&#39;re just going to offer our support.&quot;

      Tsuru continued on with the utmost seriousness. &quot;It&#39;s your support that we&#39;re all 
worried about - I mean, it was good for me but I don&#39;t think it will be good for Tsuki.&quot;

      Erin flushed a bright red and covered her face. Faye let out a long sigh. &quot;You have 
one three way with a girl and they all turn against you.&quot;

      Josh and Bakra exchanged awkward looks as Mina pulled Eveon off the couch. &quot;We&#39;ll go 
see how she is then,&quot; the ebony haired girl said, tugging her girlfriend along for the ride. 
She didn&#39;t like the way Carmilla had been eyeing her again.

      &quot;I think it&#39;s best if I go see Hoshi,&quot; Krystal said, getting up. &quot;She&#39;ll probably more 
comfortable around me...&quot; Isaka quickly followed her out of the room. She still hadn&#39;t had a 
chance to be alone with Krystal yet...

      The remaining people in the room sat in a comfortable silence before Josh got up. &quot;I 
guess we can all relax now...&quot; He turned to Bakra and motioned to the hallway. &quot;Hey, do you 
want to go practice some swordplay?&quot;

      Bakra stood up and stretched. &quot;Yep, sounds like a blast.&quot;

      The two men exited the living room as Tsuru looked confused. &quot;Swordplay? Why would 
they want to go do that right after fighting a huge battle?&quot;

      Seth ruffled his hair. &quot;They&#39;re not really sword fighting...&quot;

      Tycara looked up at him. &quot;Then... what are they doing?&quot;

      He patted his girlfriend on the head as Carmilla giggled. Tsuru turned bright red when 
she caught on to what Seth was saying. It was then that Faye and Erin exchanged glances 
before getting up as well.

      &quot;You know,&quot; Faye said, walking over to Tsuru. &quot;We never exactly finished what we 
started.&quot;

      Tsuru averted her eyes to the ground. &quot;Uh... did we...? I guess we did get 
interrupted...&quot;

      Erin giggled and leaned in to whisper into her ear. &quot;If you ever want to finish, we 
don&#39;t mind.&quot;

      As the pair made their leave, they weren&#39;t oblivious to the death glare they were 
receiving from Carmilla. The vampire was now stirring her tea not to dissolve sugar, but 
rather to calm her anger. She leveled her gaze on a flustered Tsuru. &quot;What was that all 
about?&quot;

      The ebony haired woman flinched. &quot;Nothing - nothing you need to concern yourself 
with.&quot;

      Tycara got up and pulled Seth with her. &quot;Seth, I&#39;m pretty much sixteen now! So...!&quot;

      Seth laughed and peeked over at the still brooding vampire. Tycara didn&#39;t always 
understand what was going on, but she did know that it was best to leave the tense living 
room. &quot;Yes, yes you are! And the two of us are going to go do age-appropriate, non-sword 
fighting, family friendly activities!&quot;

      The couple quickly extricated themselves from the room, leaving Tsuru behind to deal 
with a certain vampire. Carmilla sipped at the tea calmly before setting it down. She 
scooted over on the couch to be closer to the armchair Tsuru was sitting in. The Demon Lord 
hesitantly tried to scoot away, but alas, there was little space to scoot in a one person 
seat.

      Carmilla stared at her, trying to think of the right words. If she referred to Tsuru 
as her &#39;knight, the young woman would think she was trying to own her. If she complimented 
her on how utterly beautiful she was, Tsuru would think she was being a pervert. If she got 
mad about a supposed three way, Tsuru would think her too clingy.

      The vampire racked her brain for the correct way to start a conversation that would 
eventually lead to Tsuru falling in love with her and the two of them living together 
forever and doing romantic things, like... like... Carmilla would think of that later - 
right now it was time for seduction!

      Which she happened to suck at horribly when it came to Tsuru. It was then that the 
young woman met her gaze, a blush on her cheeks from the intensity of Carmilla&#39;s stare. 
&quot;...is there... uh... something wrong...?&quot;

      The vampire pursed her lips. &quot;Besides you not falling head over heels for me?&quot;

      Tsuru sighed and rolled her eyes as the vampire inwardly cursed herself. Of course she 
said something stupid, didn&#39;t she always.

      &quot;I&#39;m not some silly little thing that you can make fall in love with you,&quot; Tsuru said, 
unhappy. &quot;We&#39;ve been over this for years. You&#39;re even more unchangeable than Isaka. It&#39;s 
always the same thing - my knight, dear little Tsuru, my love. It&#39;s just...&quot;

      Carmilla flopped back against the couch. &quot;Ah! This is so infuriating!&quot;

      Tsuru was taken aback from her outburst, but said nothing more.

      &quot;Krystal is a beautiful girl and she&#39;s kind and she&#39;s got a nice body and she seems 
very pure and her legs look so-&quot;

      Tsuru let out a slight cough. Carmilla suddenly remembered why she started such a 
conversation. &quot;I&#39;m not... her. I can see why you like her so much and it&#39;s so hard to know 
that I&#39;m nothing like what you want.&quot;

      The Demon Lord shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s not something we can help. If I don&#39;t like you-&quot;

      &quot;Oh, just you wait!&quot; The vampire shot up from the couch. &quot;I&#39;m never going to give you 
up!&quot;

      Tsuru ruffled her hair. &quot;But you don&#39;t know anything about me, besides the fact that 
you think I&#39;m beautiful-&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re strong, kind and merciless. You think things through and try your hardest not 
to be bound by emotions that would otherwise blind the masses. You allow your heart to cut a 
path for you and your mind to tell it when to stop.&quot; The vampire grinned at her. &quot;I find all 
those qualities a lot more attractive than your body.&quot;

      Tsuru attempted to back away as Carmilla stepped closer. Unfortunately, she was still 
in the comfy armchair and could only sink deeper into its cushions. &quot;W...wait a second, 
we&#39;ve never really spoken so how could you...?&quot;

      &quot;Oh, I came to the conclusion myself after stalking you for hundreds of years. I went 
through the trouble of harassing every one you came in contact with to tell me about you...&quot; 
Tsuru closed her eyes and sighed. Only Carmilla would do something as crazy as that.

      The vampire stopped in front of the chair, but presumptuously put her hands on the 
armrests and leaned in. &quot;I find it funny that you sit here and accuse me of not knowing you, 
when you don&#39;t know a thing about me.&quot;

      Tsuru knew she was stuck - she could violently try to overpower Carmilla... but that 
wouldn&#39;t be too nice. &quot;Tell me, Tsuru. Did you ever stop to consider what I&#39;m like as a 
person?&quot;

      &quot;No - you&#39;re just the crazy vampire who turned my life upside down because you wanted 
to screw me. Thanks to you, I was even more vulnerable to Isaka and her... seduction...&quot; 
Tsuru murmured out the last word in embarrassment. &quot;And now you&#39;re no longer an evil vampire 
lord but you&#39;re still so persistent.&quot;

      Carmilla leaned in closer and Tsuru could foresee her future. The woman in front of 
her was going to take advantage of their awkward closeness and lounge all over her 
seductively. &quot;Carmilla, I-I... I think I should go.&quot;

      Tsuru stood up, trying to push Carmilla away, but she was steadfast. &quot;Hey! You&#39; 
haven&#39;t finished listening to me! You never listen to me Tsuru. You always preach about me 
not understand you, but when have you ever given me a chance?&quot;

      &quot;Carmilla, it&#39;s just-&quot; At that moment, Tsuru stepped forward and Carmilla began to 
fall backwards. She yanked on Tsuru&#39;s arm and they tumbled to the floor, a mess of limbs. 
The vampire held her head and let out a groan. &quot;Oh, Carmilla, are you okay?&quot;

      She gave a stiff nod before looking up at Tsuru with a smile. &quot;Yes... but I never 
thought you&#39;d be the one on top of me...&quot;

      Tsuru sighed for the nth time that day, but let out a yelp as their positions suddenly 
switched. Carmilla was hovering over her with a wide grin. &quot;I like this much better,&quot; the 
vampire cooed. &quot;Now, Tsuru... after tripping me-&quot;

      &quot;It... it was an accident! I&#39;m really sorry!&quot;

      &quot;...anyways, after tripping me and never giving me a chance to speak, I think you need 
to make up for it.&quot; She cupped Tsuru&#39;s cheek delicately. &quot;Take me out on a date?&quot;

      Tsuru stared before making coherent speak. &quot;A... wha...?&quot;

      &quot;A date - you know, going out together. We could be like humans and go to the mall! 
Doesn&#39;t that sound like fun?&quot;

      Tsuru started to sit up. &quot;But what if I-&quot;

      She was immediately tackled down on the ground, Carmilla completely violating her 
personal space. &quot;If you don&#39;t agree, then I will have no choice but to latch myself to you 
and constantly touch you inappropriately for the rest of the day, if not week.&quot;

      Tsuru let out a whimper. There was nothing quite like having a parasite fall in love 
with you...
