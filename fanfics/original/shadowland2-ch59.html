<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch58.html">Back to Part 58</a><pre>&quot;Hold together Kim.&quot; Jenn whispered to the steadily fading girl at her 
feet, &quot;You can&#39;t leave me now. Not when I haven&#39;t been able to tell you 
how I feel about you.&quot; 

Kim&#39;s eyes slowly opened and she reached out towards Jenn, &quot;Jenn... I&#39;m 
sorry...&quot; Her voice was hollow and distant, yet Jenn could still hear 
the sadness in her tone. 

Jenn grabbed for the girl&#39;s hand only to have it pass through her own. 
She stared in disbelief at her hands, it was as if Kim was nothing more 
then a ghost, &quot;N... no...&quot; Jenn glanced down at Kim&#39;s face, which had 
now vanishing to a point that Jenn could clearly see the red carpet 
below the girl&#39;s head. Trembling Jenn tried to touch the girl&#39;s face 
only to find her fingers pass through the girl&#39;s cheek, &quot;You can&#39;t die. 
Not now. Not ever.&quot; Tears tumbled over Jenn&#39;s cheeks as she watched her 
friend disappear before her very eyes. 

Kim gave a weak smile, &quot;I don&#39;t belong here.&quot; She stated softly then 
glanced over at her twin, &quot;She&#39;s the real me. She&#39;s the one that you 
meet all those years ago, the one that kissed you. Not me. I am 
nothing.&quot; 

&quot;Stop talking like that.&quot; Jenn demanded, sorrowfully, &quot;You&#39;re the one 
who came to my rescue. The one who saved me from that nightmarish world 
and you&#39;re the one I want to get to know more.&quot;

Kim slowly shook her head, &quot;She saved you. She showed me the way to you 
that first time and pushed me to do the right thing when I was about to 
give up.&quot; She remarked tiredly, glancing over to her double and reaching 
out towards her, &quot;She fought off the monsters in the night. She is the 
one you have been falling for. Not me.&quot; 

&quot;Stop talking like that.&quot; Jenn wiped at her tears with the sleeve of her 
shirt, &quot;Stop acting like this is the end. Jessica will save you. When 
she comes back we can all have dinner together and forget all of this 
ever happened.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d like that...&quot; Kim smiled weakly and then winced in pain. 

&quot;Kim?!?&quot; Jenn frantically tried to find a way to comfort the girl, &quot;Hang 
in there. Everything will be all right you will see. Just don&#39;t give 
up.&quot; 

&quot;I.. I wish I w... was as strong as Kima.&quot; Kim stated through a haze of 
pain, &quot;Th... that I... I could stop being so weak.&quot; She rolled her head 
over to gaze up at Jenn and raised a hand to touch the girl&#39;s face, 
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry I... push... ed you away and ca... called you 
disgusting. Y... you are n... not disgusting.... Y... you are the most 
beautiful girl I&#39;ve ever met.&quot; Tears fell through Kim&#39;s face, leaving 
small damp droplets on the carpet, &quot;I... I wish I was the one that ki... 
kissed you.&quot; She stated thinly, then slowly her hand dropped to her side 
and she lightly closed her eyes. 

Jenn nervously scanned the girl, &quot;Kim!?!&quot; She frantically tried to touch 
the girl only to have her hands pass right through Kim&#39;s body, &quot;KIM!?!&quot; 
Kim quickly faded away leaving only the stain from her tears behind, 
&quot;NO!!! NOOOOOOOO!!!&quot; Jenn dropped upon the spot where Kim once lay and 
let out a mournful sob. 

Abruptly a powerful wind started to circle around Jenn causing her hair 
to flip wildly about. Jenn sat up to see a glowing silhouette where Kim 
once lay and she could feel Kim&#39;s presence all around her. She could 
almost smell Kim&#39;s hair upon the air as it twirled around her, and then, 
all at once, the winds picked up in speed and shot off in every 
direction, sending waves of emotion across the Academy. 

Without warning the many students of Whispering Hills were filled with 
an intense and overwhelming sense of sadness and pain. Even though most 
of them had not known Kimberly they felt as her presence faded away 
causing several girls to suddenly break into uncontrolled bouts of sobs. 
Everyone knew someone important had just died somewhere in their home 
and they fell silent as they prayed for Kim&#39;s soul to find its way home. 

Jenn let out a howl of anguish as she clawed at the ground where Kim 
once lay. Amy rushed to the girl&#39;s aid, pulling Jenn into her arms and 
trying to sooth her pains. Natalie huddled into Alyson as she tried to 
hide her own tears. Misty and Cherilyn ran down the stairs just as Kris 
burst through the front doors and Tanya through the cafeteria doors. 

They all stopped the moment they saw Jenn crying in Amy&#39;s arms, somehow 
everyone knew what had happened and just wished it were not true. A 
deafening silence fell over the Western Dorm as everyone held their 
breath, waiting for Kim to reappear and give them that timid little 
smile of her&#39;s. The minutes passed by as they all began to realize the 
reality of their situation. Kim was gone and she would never return. Now 
they could only wait and hope that their other friends would return to 
them. Their prays falling upon Jessica in hopes that she would able to 
overcome her fears and pull the girls out of their dreams or there would 
be several more vacant beds in the Western Dorm that night.
