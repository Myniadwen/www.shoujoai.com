<a href="../original/hartmind-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>After a time Samantha slowly pulled herself into a seated position and 
looked up at the nurse, &quot;Thank you for staying with me.&quot; 

&quot;My pleasure.&quot; The nurse returned politely, &quot;It is not everyday that I 
get to comfort a pretty girl like yourself.&quot; She leaned in close to the 
girl and whispered into her ear, &quot;There are mostly creepy old men here 
and I&#39;d prefer to be comforting you then them.&quot;

Samantha let out a soft giggle and smiled. &quot;Can I go to the bathroom?&quot; 
She inquired shyly. 

The nurse nodded and pointed to the corner of the room, &quot;It is right 
over there.&quot; 

Sam carefully crawled out of the bed and gingerly set a foot upon the 
ground, testing to see how steady her legs were, if her arm suddenly did 
not want to work what would she do if the same happened with her legs. 
The thought terrified her, never being able to run through fields 
anymore, never being able to ride her bike through the forest paths. 

&quot;Do you need any help?&quot; Janis inquired, watching as the girl wobbly 
walked around the bed.

&quot;N... no...&quot; Sam replied as she used the bed to help steady herself. She 
found herself slightly off balance but could walk all right and let out 
a sigh of relief. She took a step forward to discover that her arm was 
still attached to something. The doctors had stripped her of most of the 
monitors, but she still had an IV attached to her left arm. Cautiously 
she reached out to grab hold of the pole and using it like a crutch as 
she moved towards the washroom. The moment she closed the door she 
leaned against it and let herself sink to the ground. 

((Sam?)) Star worriedly inquired, ((Are you alright?))

((I don&#39;t know)) Samantha replied, curling her legs up close to her 
body, trying to keep her emotions under control, ((I&#39;m all alone.))

((Not entirely.)) Star corrected the girl, ((I&#39;m still with you.)) 

Sam shook her head ruefully, ((I still don&#39;t even know who you are.)) 
Samantha noted, ((Don&#39;t you have to sleep or something? I mean are you 
going to be inside of my head all the time?))

((It looks that way. Maybe it will help if I tell you more about myself. 
Let&#39;s see...)) Star thought to herself for a moment, ((I just turned 
sixteen today. I love stuffed animals and 80&#39;s music and video games 
and...)) 

Sam let out a small laugh, ((That is not what I meant)) She remarked 
with an amused smile upon her face. 

Star let out a sigh, ((I bet your smile is beautiful. I wish I could see 
it.))

Sam flushed, ((I&#39;m far from beautiful.)) She remarked miserably. 

((Let me be the judge of that.)) Star suddenly demanded, ((Go to a 
mirror.))

Sam&#39;s heart began to race uncontrollably, ((You can see what I see?)) 
She inquired worriedly, staring down at the pale blue hospital gown that 
covered her upper body to mid calf.

((Only when I close my eyes.)) Star assured the girl, ((Why don&#39;t you 
try it first. Close your eyes and take a look.)) She offered. 

A crooked smile crossed Sam&#39;s face, ((Really? You don&#39;t mind?)) She 
inquired nervously. 

Star shrugged, ((It&#39;s not like I walk around naked all the time or 
something.)) Star stated with a small laugh, ((I&#39;m just sitting in bed 
in my nightgown so there isn&#39;t much for you to see, but give it a try.)) 

(A... Alright...)) Samantha agreed, then took a deep breath before 
lightly closing her eyes. For a moment she only saw darkness, then a 
moment later an image began to come into view. Before her she saw a long 
bed come into focus. It was covered in a large soft looking comforter 
with images of cats printed upon its surface. Under the surface of the 
blanket she could make out of form of legs and she saw two arms clad in 
a pink flannel nightgown. Slowly she began to feel the warmth of the 
comforter and the softness of the flannel against her skin. She took in 
a deep breath to catch a soft scent of flowery shampoo along with 
something else she could not quiet explain, however the feeling calmed 
Sam&#39;s anxiety and she found her mind finally slowing down in pace. 

((You smell wonderful.)) She breathed softly and suddenly she felt a 
heat rise up around her that she figured must have been Star blushing in 
embarrassment. 

((It is only shampoo.)) Star nervously explained, ((I just had a bath 
before going to bed and my hair is still wet.)) She stated as she 
anxiously ran a hand through her hair and Sam could feel the cool, damp, 
feeling of it running through her fingers. 

Sam quickly opened her eyes and shook her head, almost expecting to feel 
damp hair against her head, ((That was strange.)) She said as the sense 
of Star lingered ever so slightly before slowly fading away. 

((I... I didn&#39;t exp...expect that...)) Star admitted with a pant. 

((Are you alright?)) Sam inquired worried, ((You sound out of breath.))

((I&#39;m fine.)) Star took a long breath and let it out, ((It felt as if 
you were a part of me for a moment there that when you left it felt as 
if you were pulling me with you.)) 

Sam rubbed the back of her neck in embarrassment, ((I&#39;m sorry, this is 
all new to me.)) Sam reminded the girl. 

((This is a first for me too.)) Star explained, ((Occasionally I fall in 
touch with someone near me, but nothing like this. I&#39;m almost afraid to 
try myself.))

((You still want to try?)) Sam squirmed into the corner of the washroom, 
now that she knew it was more then just seeing, but everything else as 
well, the thought of allowing the girl further into her mind scared her.

((Don&#39;t be scared.)) Star soothed, ((I will not hurt you, or poke around 
in your mind if that is what you are worried about.))

((You promise?)) Sam asked, suddenly feeling vulnerable. 

((I promise.)) Star agreed with a nod of her head that Sam felt, ((So 
can I finally see the face of the girl I&#39;m sharing minds with?)) She 
inquired interestedly. 

Sam glanced up at a mirror that hung over a small sink next to a towel, 
((Promise you won&#39;t laugh?)) She asked nervously. 

((Now why would I laugh?)) Star returned, ((I have a cousin that wears 
tones of white make up and thousands of piercing and I&#39;ve never laughed 
at her, in fact I find her quiet interesting.))

Sam made a small smirk, ((I know someone like that, but that is far from 
what I look like... I&#39;m just plain as hell.)) 

((Will you let me have my own opinion for once and show me your face?)) 
She demanded with a chuckle and a shake of her head, ((Are you always 
like this?))

((Like what?)) Sam asked curiously. 

((No self esteem what so ever.)) Star bluntly stated. 

Sam winced, ((Yeah... I guess that would be me...)) She stared up at the 
mirror again and took a hold of the edge of the sink; ((Well since you 
insist...)) She hauled herself to her feet and took a deep breath as she 
set her eyes upon the mirror. ((Take a look quickly before I change my 
mind.))

((Alright.))

Sam was not sure what she was waiting for when suddenly she felt 
something pass through her and she could sense Star within her as ever 
part of her body began to lightly tingle. It felt as if she was in a 
strong embrace and it made Sam&#39;s heart race. She suddenly became 
light-headed and needed to hold onto the sink in order to keep her 
balance, but her hand slipped on the porcelain sink and she tumbled to 
the floor with a heavy thud.  

((Sam? Are you alright?)) Star inquired uneasily. 

((I...)) She could feel warm tears build up behind her eyes and quickly 
wiped them away, ((I feel dizzy...)) She explained as she tried to catch 
her breath. 

((Inhale slowly, take long deep breathes.)) Star instructed. 

Sam did as she was told and slowly her head began to clear, but her 
limbs felt weak and she struggled to get to a seated position again.

&quot;Samantha!?!&quot; Janis&#39;s voice drifted from beyond the door, &quot;Samantha are 
you alright?&quot; 

She tried to call out to the woman, but could not find her voice. She 
heard the woman scramble around behind the door then it slowly opened, 
knocking her over again. 

&quot;Samantha...Sam?!?&quot; The nurse knelt next to Sam and looked into the 
girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;What happened?&quot; 

&quot;I... I fell...&quot; She said in a weak tired voice. 

&quot;Did you hit your head?&quot; The nurse anxiously inquired. 

Sam slowly shook her head as the nurse helped her to her feet and over 
to the bed. 

&quot;You should rest up and don&#39;t try so hard.&quot; The nurse urged as she 
helped the girl back into bed, &quot;If you need anything just call for me 
with that button.&quot; She explained as she handed a small square devise to 
the girl, &quot;It operates the bed as well so if you don&#39;t feel comfortable 
you can adjust it.&quot; 

Sam smiled at the nurse, &quot;Thank you.&quot; 

Janis ran her hand across the girl&#39;s cheek and returned the smile, 
&quot;Anytime, now you rest up and I&#39;ll be right down the hall if you need 
me.&quot; 

Sam slowly nodded as she watched the nurse slowly leave the room. 

((Star?)) Sam reached out with her mind, afraid that she might have lost 
her friend.

((I&#39;m right here.)) Star replied tensely and Sam was almost certain she 
could sense that the girl has been crying a moment ago, ((A... are you 
alright?))

((What happened?)) Sam inquired, ((I thought I almost lost you.))

((So did I...I&#39;m sorry.)) Star apologized, ((That was my fault. I should 
have warned you about that. I assumed you knew that could happen when 
you get too close to an extreme emotional source or have something pass 
through your body.))

((This is all new too me.)) Sam stated weakly, ((Until today I&#39;d only 
had small things happen with animals and sometimes knew when it 
rained.))

((I&#39;m sorry.)) Star repeated woefully. 

Sam was certain this time that she tasted tears upon her lips and a vice 
upon her heart, ((Are you crying?))

((I&#39;m sorry...)) Star sniffled, ((I finally find a friend and I nearly 
kill her. I&#39;m so stupid.)) 

((You consider me a friend?)) Sam inquired perplexedly, ((You barely 
know me.))

((Do you know how hard it is to find friends when everyone considers you 
a freak.)) Star inquired miserably, ((My mom was forced to move to a new 
town because me and I don&#39;t know anyone in this town, accept for my 
cousin, but she has to be friends because she is family. Just when I 
find another kindred spirit I mess up completely.)) 

Sam shook her head, ((You did not mess up. You... did you call me a 
&quot;Kindred Spirit&quot;)) 

Star flushed, ((Well, yeah... that is what you are... aren&#39;t you? I&#39;ve 
never met another psychic soul like yours and it feels like we were 
destine to meet... I mean... that is...)) Star became increasingly 
flustered with every other word, ((Geez, you must think I&#39;m stupid.))

Sam smiled, ((It does feel that way doesn&#39;t it.)) She agreed. ((I can&#39;t 
explain it, but I am glad we met. I don&#39;t know how I would have handled 
today without you.))

Star let out a sigh of relief, ((Glad to be of help.))

Sam let out a yawn and glanced around herself, ((I wish I had my journal 
because I would love to write all this down. It has been one hell of a 
day.)) She stated sleepily, ((Trish would never believe it if I told 
her.)) 

((Who is Trish?)) Star asked, trying to make conversation. 

((A friend... or I hope she is still my friend after the way I acted 
today.)) Sam said miserably as she recalled the events before ending up 
in the hospital and pulled the pillow around her head, ((God, I&#39;m such 
an idiot.))

((It can&#39;t be that bad.)) Star insisted, ((What happened?)) 

Sam let go of the pillow and stared up at the ceiling overhead, square 
tiles of dry wall formed the ceiling and there was a long florescent 
lamp over her head that illuminated her bed with its soft glow. She 
starred at the light as she tried to consider how to word what had 
happened to her earlier, ((It was all because of that stupid toy and 
that device.)) She suddenly recalled the Meephit and then sat up to find 
the toy lying upon the blankets to her side. Gingerly she picked up the 
stuffed toy and turned it over in her hands. The psychic calculator that 
lived within its chest was no longer there and then she remembered it 
was in her back pocket when she fell. She began searching for her 
clothes to find the gadget laying upon the night table to her left, its 
display blinking as if it were trying to get her attention. 

((What the hell?)) Sam picked up the toy to find still blinked the same 
message from when she was hit upon the head, ((How did this thing know I 
was in danger?)) She asked curiously. 

((What thing?)) Star inquired curiously, ((What are you talking about?))

((That Meephit. Before my mother hit me it started beeping away and told 
me to run away.)) She explained in a bewildered tone. 

((That toy that my mother got me when I met you?)) Star inquired, ((I 
felt there was something strange about it, but I don&#39;t believe it can 
really tell the future.)) 

Sam rubbed her head, ((I didn&#39;t believe it either, but when I asked it 
if someone loved me it told me that my best friend did.))

((It did?)) Star puzzled over this idea, ((Did it use her name?))

Sam shook her head, ((Not exactly, but it said that she was waiting 
upstairs and knew that I was going to have dinner with her.))

((So what did you do?)) 

Sam let out a deep sigh, ((I ran...))

((Why? Are you afraid of lesbians?)) Star inquired seriously. 

Sam could sense an edge to the girl&#39;s voice and a tension building up 
inside of her. ((N... no...)) Sam shook her head and rubbed at her eyes, 
((I have no problem with her being gay... I just...)) Her thoughts began 
to tremble as she tried to explain what it was that she feared more then 
anything else. 

((What is it? You can tell me.)) Star insisted soothingly, ((I won&#39;t 
make fun of you. I sort of know how you feel... I fell in love with my 
best friend and it freaked me out. I could not get her out of my mind 
and that scared me more then this psychic stuff.))

Sam became startled by what she was hearing, &quot;You like girls&quot; She 
exclaimed before realizing she was speaking aloud. 

A nurse peeked through the window of the room and opened the door, &quot;Is 
everything alright in here?&quot; The woman inquired. 

Sam nodded, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I was just...&quot; She glanced around herself till 
her eyes feel upon the toad and held it up, &quot;I was just talking to my 
toad is all.&quot; She explained sheepishly. 

&quot;Oh... Alright...&quot; The nurse gave her a peculiar look before slipping 
back out of the room and let the door softly close behind her. 

Sam dropped her head in her hands, ((She is going to think I&#39;m a 
child.)) Sam stated dismally. She was answered with only silence, 
((Star... Are you there?)) She held a hand close to her chest as she 
realized how stupid she was for reacting the way she did. Somewhere she 
could feel Star&#39;s heart beating wildly and the sensation of intense 
fear. 

((Star... I&#39;m sorry... I...)) Sam let out a deep sigh and ran a hand 
over her face, ((I&#39;m so stupid.)) Now she could feel her own heart 
racing and tears threatened to burst forth from her eyes yet again, 
((Please don&#39;t leave me... I&#39;m sorry... I... I&#39;m scared Star...)) She 
stammered as her thoughts tumbled over itself, ((I... I... think I l... 
love Trish and it scares the hell out of me.)) She finally admitted and 
with this admittance a steady flow of words began to uncontrollably 
tumble from her lips, ((I love the feeling of her close to me and the 
way she plays with my feet, I love the way she comforts me when I&#39;m 
upset and how she always seems to know when I need a hug. I&#39;m so used to 
being hated that I&#39;m scared of the thought that someone could love 
someone like me. I&#39;m afraid to loss her and I don&#39;t know what to do.)) 
She buried her face into the pillow and let out a tired sob. 

Sam suddenly felt Star&#39;s warmth wash over her and she imagined the girl 
curled up behind her, arms wrapped around her body and holding her 
tightly. 

((You don&#39;t have to be afraid anymore.)) Star soothed, ((I&#39;m here for 
you and I will never leave your side.))

((But what if our link is broken.)) Sam worried, ((Then what will I 
do.))

((Then I&#39;ll come searching for you in person.)) Star insisted, ((I will 
not stop until I find you.))

((But we could me far apart.)) Sam remarked, ((I could be in another 
country for all we know.))

Sam could feel Star smile, ((We are much closer then you think.))

((How can you be certain?)) Sam said uneasily. 

((Fine, where do you live?)) Star inquired. 

((Whetshones.)) Sam answered, scared that this would only verify her 
worries. 

((WHETSHONES!?!)) Star exclaimed in surprised, ((Oh gee! This is great! 
We just moved here a little while ago. Maybe I&#39;ll see you in the 
morning. What hospital are you staying at?))

((Ummm... Uhhh...)) Sam found herself shocked by this sudden turn of 
events. The possibility that Star could visit her in the morning both 
excited and scared her. She glanced down upon the plastic bracelet that 
hung around her wrist to find the hospital&#39;s name printed along with her 
other information, ((St. Michelle&#39;s...)) 

((I know where that is. I&#39;ll come to see you.)) Star insisted with such 
excitement that even Sam could feel the rush, ((You get some sleep and 
I&#39;ll see you soon.))

((A... alright...)) Sam agreed, but feared she would never be able to 
sleep now. 

((Sam...)) Star&#39;s voice rose up in Sam&#39;s head after a few moments of 
silence, ((I&#39;m glad we met.))

((So am I.)) Sam awaited another reply, but had a feeling that Star had 
fallen fast asleep for she could feel a relaxing sensation fill her mind 
and heart. She wondered if this would be how she spends the rest of her 
life, forever sharing her heart and soul with another. Part of her found 
the idea comforting, never to be alone again, but she worried that soon 
she would get on Star&#39;s nerves and the girl would not want to be around 
her any longer. She tried to force those thoughts from her mind and get 
some sleep, even if it was restless.
