**************************
	&quot;It&#39;s still raining,&quot; Kara said softly.

	&quot;And I&#39;m more comfortable here,&quot; Mitsuko added with a smile.

	Kara returned the smile and sat on the sofa next to her. She 
settled in and pulled Mitsuko close. &quot;You&#39;re a minx, you know that?&quot; 
Kara joked. &quot;It&#39;s one of your many qualities I love.&quot;

	&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mitsuko cooed. &quot;You&#39;re chest is so warm, can I sleep 
here?&quot;

	Kara chuckled a bit, &quot;You know I love having your head on my 
chest.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ll remember that ... &quot; Mitsuko said, yawning. &quot;G&#39;night.&quot;

	&quot;Night, love.&quot; Kara whispered. &#39;How&#39;d I ever manage without her?&#39; 
She mused silently. &#39;She&#39;s like an angel on earth.&#39; &quot;I love you 
Mitsuko.&quot; She whispered, stroking Mitsuko&#39;s hair.

	&quot;Ditto,&quot; Mitsuko said in her sleep. &quot;Always.&quot;

	Kara smiled wistfully and turned the table lamp off. &#39;Good thing I 
dimmed the lights earlier.&#39; She thought, closing her eyes. &#39;Sweet 
dreams&#39;

----------------------------------

	&quot;Keia Ordelain is energetic, friendly, and very reliable. Her 
deep-set, dark-red eyes are like two rubies, displaying several layers 
of emotion. Her silky, oak-brown hair is worn in a style that reminds 
people of a waterfall. She is tall, at a leggy 5&#39;10&quot;. Her skin is smooth 
and light-colored. She has the long-fingered hands of a musician. Her 
wardrobe is complicated, with many outfits that are coordinated hues of 
green, blue, red, gold, and black,&quot; a smaller-looking girl described the 
woman next to her.

	Keia had her head lowered, embarrassed at the amount of detail in 
the description. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she murmured softly. She took her seat, 
hiding her face for the entirety of the class. The bell chimed about 
after an hour, and the students fled the large room.

	&quot;Hey Keia, what&#39;s up?&quot; Kara called, catching up with her. &quot;I heard 
the introduction you had. From my point of view, the proverbial nail was 
hit on the proverbial head.&quot; Kara smiled, then burst into a fit of 
giggles. &quot;You should have seen your face! Man, you were BEET-red girl!&quot;

	Keia said something that couldn&#39;t be heard and then looked at her 
long-time friend. &quot;You would laugh,&quot; She replied demurely. &quot;Maybe I 
should have that girl give YOU an introduction. She went a little too 
into detail.&quot;

	&quot;Whatever,&quot; Kara said, her laughing finally over. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t 
bee embarrassed, it was all true.&quot;

	&quot;I bet,&quot; Keia replied sarcastically.

	Keia and Kara made their way through the crowded hallway of the 
community college. They chatted animatedly about how weird the day had 
been so far. Keia still, slightly flushed from each mention of the 
detailed introduction from the class they just finished. In the student 
lounge, they bought some food and nabbed the last table to eat and do 
some work they had been given. They both had the next hour free for 
study, so they chatted and did some of the smaller projects the 
accumulated. Keia finished her day&#39;s assignments and decided to take the 
rest of the free period to relax. She had just closed her eyes and laid 
her head back when Kara tapped her arm.

	&quot;Hey Keia, looked behind you,&quot; Kara said pointing to the table 
directly behind them. &quot;That&#39;s Jura isn&#39;t it?&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Keia said, turning in her chair. &quot;If you think 
she&#39;s here, then you must be ...&quot; The sentence dropped with Keia&#39;s jaw.

	There, like Kara said, sat Jura Chanein. The peaceful woman Keia 
had been in love with for months. She had eyes of the deepest 
emerald-green. Her amber-colored hair is long, silky, curly, and worn in 
a style that makes people think of a comet&#39;s trail. She is a lithe 5&#39;6, 
and has a highly feminine build. Her skin is a tanned and smooth. She 
has a strong chin and small feet. Her form-fitting wardrobe is always 
impeccable, and consists of many shades of red, yellow, green, and 
brown.

	&quot;Um ... Keia?&quot; Kara whispered, &quot;you might want to pick up your 
jaw.&quot;

	&quot;R ... right,&quot; Keia managed. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize she had enrolled 
here.&quot;

	Seeing them, Jura waved and rose from the table. She walked over 
and gave a beautiful, radiant smile. &quot;Hey you!&quot; She beamed. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
know you two went to this college! Is Mitsuko here too?&quot;

	&quot;I wish she was,&quot; Kara said truthfully. &quot;My day would be a load 
better if she was enrolled.&quot;

	&quot;Hi ... Jura,&quot; Keia stuttered without embarrassing herself. &quot;It&#39;s 
good ... to see you! When did you enroll?&quot;

	&quot;Three months ago,&quot; Jura replied, sitting next to Keia. &quot;I started 
today. What about you two?&quot;

	&quot;I enrolled a year ago, and have been attending for nine months.&quot; 
Kara replied, taking a drink of her soda.

	&quot;Same as you,&quot; Keia replied quietly. &quot;I&#39;m having a good day too.&quot;

	&quot;Oh good!&quot; Jura exclaimed. &quot;What classes do you have later?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ve got Business Politics and Advanced Trig,&quot; Kara said with a 
sigh. &quot;Long three hours for me.&quot;

	&quot;I have Advanced English for Writers and Orchestra,&quot; Keia replied. 
&quot;Being a music and English major isn&#39;t a picnic these days.&quot;

	&quot;Hey, I&#39;ve got those classes too!&quot; Jura exclaimed happily. &quot;We can 
sit together, and we&#39;ll walk to the dorms together afterwards!&quot;

	&quot;Ye ... yeah,&quot; Keia replied hesitantly. &#39;Oh no! I&#39;m going to make 
a fool of myself!&#39;

	&quot;Have fun you two!&quot; Kara teased. &quot;I&#39;m off, see you after class!&quot;

	The two classes passed agonizingly slow for Keia. Whenever the 
professors had stopped lecturing, Jura sat and talked to Keia. Keia was 
rigid with fear for the full three hours, constantly examining her words 
before saying them, to keep herself from making any embarrassing 
comments. At the end of their last class, Keia and Jura headed toward 
the campus courtyard to meet up with Kara. They found the older girl 
waiting for them, on the hood of her old car.

	&quot;You still drive this old thing huh?&quot; Jura asked, barely able to 
contain her mirth.

	&quot;Unfortunately for me and Mitsuko, she does,&quot; Keia groaned. &quot;I 
still think you need to get a newer car Kara.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t need a new car when this one runs perfectly fine,&quot; Kara 
said defensively. &quot;Besides, who else gives you a ride?&quot;

	Keia moaned in defeat. &quot;I&#39;ll never convince you that this thing is 
an eyesore, and that the seats are torture on a person&#39;s ass,&quot; she 
sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll be doomed to ride in a car with seats that nearly kill the 
nerve endings in my ass until I can buy a car of my own.&quot;

	&quot;Cheer up Keia,&quot; Jura said hugging the tall girl, causing a blush 
to color her cheeks. &quot;At least my butt will be sore with yours.&quot;

	Keia chuckled nervously. &quot;Heh, that&#39;s a little comforting,&quot; she 
admitted. &#39;But ... I&#39;ll be dying of blood loss if she stays this close 
to me,&#39; she groaned inwardly. &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it ...&quot;

	Jura just held onto Keia and smiled as if today were the best day 
of her life. &quot;Okay! Let&#39;s get going!&quot; she exclaimed, dragging Keia into 
the death trap of a car. &quot;On to the dorm building!&quot;

	The car ride was peaceful and eventless. Keia was miserable, 
considering that she was getting to the point if she got any redder, 
she&#39;d have fainted. Then there was the teasing Kara was dishing out, 
coupled with the most painful car seat in existence on earth. &#39;Goddess 
... if this was any worse ... I&#39;d be fleeing the country by midnight,&#39; 
she thought mournfully. 

        &quot;Keia, do you need ointment for that rash on you&#39;re face?&quot; Kara 
asked, teasing Keia yet again. &quot;I&#39;m sure we can find something for 
shyness!&quot; Kara then broke down into a massive fit of laughter.
        
        &quot;Kara, now that wasn&#39;t nice,&quot; Jura scolded. &quot;Keia, you don&#39;t 
have a rash do you?&quot;
        
        Keia looked like a deer caught in the headlights. &quot;I ... um ... 
that is ... I ... well ... no,&quot; Keia stammered. &quot;It&#39;s just ... I ... I&#39;m 
...&quot;
        
        &quot;We&#39;ll, trip&#39;s over,&quot; Kara said, her laughter subsided. &quot;I&#39;ll 
leave you two to do whatever, just as long as it&#39;s outside my car. 
Later!&quot;
        
        &quot;Kara, wait,&quot; Keia started, but was waved off. &quot;Jura ... I ... I 
have to ... to um ... um, go. See you later okay?&quot;
        
        &quot;I guess so,&quot; Jura said, lacking the earlier enthusiasm. &quot;Can I 
come by later?&quot;
        
        &quot;I ... um guess so,&quot; Keia said, her face still flushed. &quot;It&#39;s 
building 4, second floor, room 215. I&#39;ll leave the spare key in the same 
place my mom had hers.&quot;
        
        &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll stop by sometime.&quot; Jura said, walking away sadly. 
&quot;I&#39;ll see you.&quot;
        
        &quot;Bye Jura,&quot; Keia said softly. &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;

----------------------------------




	Keia sat at the desk in her dorm room and sighed ruefully. &#39;I knew 
that I&#39;d hate myself after that.&#39; She sighed for what seemed like the 
billionth time and let her head slam lightly against the desk. &#39;Why&#39;d I 
act so damned stupid!?&#39; Her thoughts made her mood far worse than it had 
started. She wanted to take some blunt object and let a complete 
stranger pummel her to death. &quot;I&#39;m such an idiot.&quot; She finally said out 
loud.

	&quot;How are you an idiot?&quot; A soft, airy voice asked from behind her.

	&#39;Shit!&#39; Keia&#39;s mind scrambled to come up with a coherent and 
somewhat believable reply. &quot;I&#39;m an idiot, plain and simple,&quot; was all 
that came to her. &#39;Damn... That&#39;s a smooth reply. Way to go, Keia!&#39;

	&quot;You sure are a magician with words, Keia.&quot; The voice said, 
laughing and moving closer. &quot;I&#39;m still curious as to why you&#39;ve 
barricaded yourself up here, when you could be having fun somewhere with 
me. We haven&#39;t really hung out much lately. I was hoping that we could 
go shopping or something.&quot;

	The voice&#39;s source grew nearer and Keia tensed visibly. &#39;Oh ... 
what am I gonna do now!? She&#39;s only a few feet away and I&#39;m still as 
jumpy as I was when I made a fool of myself!&#39; &quot;Umm ... I ... uh ... that 
is ... well ... I have to study!&quot; Keia said, hurriedly grabbing her 
textbooks from her schoolbag. &quot;I&#39;m already falling behind and my 
teachers are on my case about my grades,&quot; Keia said, trying to hide her 
obviously tomato-red face. &quot;I&#39;ll catch up with you tomorrow. Okay, 
Jura?&quot;

	&quot;Okay ...&quot; Jura replied, her voice heavy with disappointment. 
&quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow. Oh, and Keia?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, Jura?&quot; Kei said, still hiding her face.

	&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re an idiot,&quot; Jura said softly. &quot;I think you&#39;re 
less of an idiot than any other person I know. I thought you&#39;d like to 
hear that.&quot;

	&#39;Oh goddess ...&#39; Keia felt a pang in her chest, and berated 
herself yet again. &#39;I can&#39;t let her leave feeling like that.&#39; &quot;Jura, 
wait!  Please ... wait.&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Keia?&quot; Jura looked up at her hopefully.

	&quot;I&#39;m ... not really good at being articulate. That&#39;s why I&#39;m an 
idiot. And I&#39;m not really behind on my homework. I ... I made that up.&quot; 
Keia admitted hesitantly.

	&quot;Why?&quot; Jura asked simply.

	&quot;Because ... because I&#39;m ... not really sure Jura,&quot; Keia replied 
truthfully. &quot;I do like hanging out with you, but lately ... I don&#39;t know 
what&#39;s going on with me.&quot;

	&quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot; Jura asked bluntly. &quot;I&#39;m here if 
you do.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m ... not sure about now, but I can talk later,&quot; came Keia&#39;s 
reply. &quot;I do feel like going to a small caf&#130; near the mall, though. Care 
to join me?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Jura answered, smiling.

----------------------------------




	The caf&#130;&#39;s door chimed as the two girls entered. Keia and Jura 
walked towards an empty table when they were spotted by Mitsuko.

	&quot;Keia, Jura, over here!&quot; Mitsuko called. &quot;What brings you two 
here?&quot;

	&quot;Ah, Mitsuko!&quot; Jura said beaming. &quot;We came for the chocolate pie 
and a soda. Is Kara here with you?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m right behind ya,&quot; Kara&#39;s voice said from behind, &quot;and 
you&#39;re blocking my path.&quot; Kara patted Jura&#39;s arm and gave her a big 
grin. &quot;You two finally out on a date?&quot;

	Keia suddenly froze and started sputtering nervously. &quot;Uh ... a 
... uh ... a ... d ... d ... date!?&quot; she stammered. &quot;N ... n ... not 
that! We ...  were .. we ... uh ...&quot;

	&quot;No, not a date,&quot; Jura said, laying a hand on Keia&#39;s shoulder to 
calm her. &quot;We just came to spend some time catching up while having a 
good piece of pie, and maybe a soda or two.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sure,&quot; Kara said, grinning ferally. &quot;You wanna join me and 
Mitsuko? I&#39;m sure the four of us can have some fun on a nice evening 
like this.&quot;

	&quot;It&#39;ll be a blast,&quot; Mitsuko said, enchanted. &quot;We can do lots of 
thing together!&quot;

	&quot;I ... uh ... ah, what the hell,&quot; Keia said, caving. &quot;What do you 
say Jura?&quot;

	&quot;Why not?&quot; Jura said, her smile growing. &quot;We can spend a few hours 
together, then we&#39;ll head back to the dorms.&quot;

	&quot;Why not share a room with Keia tonight?&quot; Kara said, her smirk 
growing as well. &quot;It&#39;ll be easier for you two to get caught up that way, 
right?&quot;

	&quot;What a good idea!&quot; Jura exclaimed jubilantly. &quot;We&#39;ll have so much 
fun!&quot;

	&quot;Yeah ...&quot; Keia agreed weakly. She sat next to Kara, on the 
opposite side of Mitsuko. &quot;Kara,&quot; she whispered sharply, &quot;you know how I 
feel about her. Why are you doing this to me!? Tonight is going to be 
torture!&quot;

	Kara was still grinning ferally. &quot;C&#39;mon Keia,&quot; she whispered back, 
&quot;you&#39;ll thank me later. This will solve everything!&quot;

	&quot;Thanks,&quot; Keia gritted. &quot;I&#39;ll pay you back somehow.&quot;

	&quot;No payment needed,&quot; Kara whistled. &quot;We&#39;re the best of pals. What 
are best friends for?&quot;

	&quot;Putting people through living hell,&quot; Keia muttered under her 
breath. &#39;I&#39;m going to hate myself after this night is over,&#39; Keia 
thought, her head dropping.

	Two hours later, an exhausted Jura and Keia came to the door of 
Keia&#39;s dorm room. &#39;Now, into the night of living hell,&#39; Keia mused 
sadly, and pulled out her key. &quot;You&#39;re welcome to use anything you 
need,&quot; she said, walking into the kitchen to grab some drinks &quot;The tub 
and hygiene products are included in that,&quot; she mended. &quot;You have any 
night clothes?&quot;

	&quot;I was thinking of using one of your triple extra-large t-shirts,&quot; 
Jura called back. &quot;Do you mind?&quot;

	&quot;No, not at all,&quot; Keia replied. &quot;You need anything else?&quot;

        &#39;Shower, night-shirt, am I missing anything?&#39; Jura listed it all 
in her mind. &#39;I can say I want something else, but should I?&#39; &quot;Nope, 
that should be everything,&quot; she replied. &quot;Are you taking a shower soon?&quot;
        
        &quot;Yeah, if you want to first, go ahead,&quot; Keia replied, walking 
into the living area with a plate of cookies and a two-liter of Hawaiian 
Punch. &quot;I like fruity beverages, hope you don&#39;t mid it,&quot; she said 
sheepishly.
        
        &quot;Not an issue,&quot; Jura replied with a smile. &quot;I love Hawaiian 
Punch.&quot;
        
        &quot;Okay, then,&quot; Keia said, setting the refreshments down. &quot;What 
about the shower, you want it first?&quot;
        
        &quot;You go ahead,&quot; Jura answered. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a burden.&quot;
        
        &quot;You&#39;re no such thing!&quot; Keia admonished. &quot;You sure, it&#39;s yours 
if you want it.&quot;
        
        &quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Jura replied. &quot;I&#39;ll wait till you&#39;re done. Then 
we can talk until the sun rises, okay?&quot;
        
        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Keia says with a chuckle. &quot;I&#39;ll be out in a bit, okay?&quot;
        
        &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Jura replied, with a teasing shove. &quot;Off with you, 
get that grime out of you hair, you look awful.&quot; Jura grinned and waved 
Keia off. &#39;Okay, I guess it&#39;s now or never.&#39; Jura sat occupied by her 
thoughts for a few moments. After a brisk nod, she rose and strode over 
to Keia&#39;s bathroom. &#39;If I don&#39;t do this tonight, I&#39;ll never do it.&#39; Her 
resolve strengthened, she opened the door. She tiptoed over the floor, 
pulling her clothes off silently. Approaching the running shower, she 
took a deep breath. &#39;Here goes ...&#39; She pulled the shower curtain back, 
and stepped into the tub silently. She opened her eyes and laid a hand 
on Keia&#39;s shoulder timidly. &quot;Keia, I need you to know something.&quot;
        
        &#39;Oh Goddess! She&#39;s in the shower!&#39; &quot;Yes Jura?&quot; Keia squeaked.
        
        &quot;This should say it all,&quot; Jura replied, turning Keia around and 
placing her lips on Keia&#39;s firmly. The kiss was electrifying, for them 
both. The water of the shower fell on them, but they couldn&#39;t have cared 
less. After a minute, which felt like ten to them, they parted. Keia&#39;s 
breath was deep and ragged. Jura&#39;s was lighter, but coming in short 
gasps. Their arousal was apparent, and they knew what they wanted,
        
        &quot;You have no idea how much I wanted that,&quot; Keia panted. &quot;Jura, 
what&#39;s gotten into you?&quot;
        
        &quot;Love,&quot; Jura replied simply. &quot;Love has gotten into me. I&#39;ve 
loved you for ages Keia. You&#39;ve been in my dreams since I met you and I 
need you.&quot;
        
        &quot;I&#39;ve been blind, haven&#39;t I?&quot; Keia asked with a slight chuckle. 
&quot;Where do we go from here?&quot;
        
        &quot;I have an idea, but we&#39;ll need to shower again afterwards,&quot; 
Jura replied, her voice lowered. Kissing Keia again, Jura let her hands 
roam the taller woman&#39;s body. Her left hand grasped the cheek of Keia&#39;s 
ass, while the right flicked Keia&#39;s hardening nipples. Kneading Keia&#39;s 
firm, round breasts with her right hand and her ass with her left, Jura 
reduced Keia&#39;s coherent speech into moans. Breaking the kiss, Jura&#39;s 
lips moved downward onto Keia&#39;s neck and collarbone. She stopped her 
hands long enough to turn the water off, so they could clean up later.
        
        &quot;Jura, goddess,&quot; Keia moaned. &quot;I, ohhhhhhhhhhhhh!&quot;
        
        &quot;Shush, enjoy this,&quot; Jura replied in-between kisses. &quot;Tonight&#39;s 
purely an expression of my love for you Keia.&quot;
        
        &quot;I love you Jura,&quot; Keia said huskily. &quot;That&#39;s the truth.&quot;
        
        Jura smiled and kissed the hollow of Keia&#39;s neck, dragging her 
tongue over the flesh. She kissed back up the side of her neck and took 
the lobe of Keia&#39;s ear into her mouth and nibbled it gently, eliciting a 
small purr from Keia&#39;s throat. She then kissed her way down Keia&#39;s neck, 
back to her collarbone. She planted a light kiss in the center and 
brought her left hand back up to Keia&#39;s breasts. Using the index finger 
and thumb on both hands, she tweaked Keia&#39;s aroused nipples. Keia&#39;s head 
lulled, and she moaned deeply.
        
        &quot;Goddess Jura,&quot; Keia purred, &quot;please don&#39;t stop.&quot;
        
        &quot;I don&#39;t plan to,&quot; Jura replied stepping out of the tub and 
bringing Keia with her, &quot;but we need more space and support.&quot; She then 
began to lay Keia on the floor taking her lips once more in a fiery 
passion. Breaking the kiss Jura moved down to Keia&#39;s breasts. She kissed 
one nub lightly, then repeated the kiss on the other. She licked around 
the areola, eliciting another set of moans from Keia. Using her hand to 
tweak the right nipple, while teasing the left with her tongue, Jura had 
Keia moaning and begging for more.
        
        &quot;Jura,&quot; Keia panted, &quot;please ... don&#39;t tease me.&quot;
        
        Smiling wickedly, Jura continued her slow torture on Keia&#39;s 
round orbs of flesh. She repeatedly licked and nipped at the hard nubs 
in the center, bringing several small whimpers from Keia. She finally 
stopped her torture, and began her decent to Keia&#39;s center. Planting 
light kisses on her abdomen, Jura moved downward. She paused for a 
second to give a small, teasing lick in Keia&#39;s navel, and then continued 
on slowly. She reached the small, trim patch of brown at Keia nexus, and 
drew her fingers through it slowly. Keia&#39;s musk of arousal, filled 
Jura&#39;s nostrils and she loved it. Planting a kiss above Keia&#39;s swollen 
and protruding clit, Jura parted her nether lips, drawing a small moan 
and shudder from Keia.
        
        &quot;Please,&quot; Keia gasped, running her hand over Jura&#39;s head, 
&quot;please ... I need you, Jura.&quot;
        
        Hearing Keia&#39;s plea, Jura lowered her lips to Keia&#39;s awaiting 
pussy, causing Keia to push forward to increase the contact. Jura parted 
her swollen, pink lips and let her tongue flick out slowly over Keia&#39;s 
throbbing clit once. She slid the tip up and down Keia&#39;s slit, drawing a 
loud moan and a quick thrust of her hips from the writhing girl beneath 
her. She used the fingers holding Keia&#39;s pussy lips open to part them 
even further, snaking her tongue into the dripping hole. Jura used her 
tongue to probe the soft, moist flesh of Keia&#39;s cunt, making her buck 
and grind her hips against Jura&#39;s mouth to maximize the stimulation. 
Keia&#39;s right hand was tangled in Jura&#39;s hair, holding her head in place. 
Jura&#39;s tongue swirled around inside of Keia&#39;s pussy, pushing her closer 
and closer to the brink of her explosion. Jura savored the taste of 
Keia&#39;s juices, enjoying every second of it.
        
        &quot;JurAAAAA!&quot; Keia cried. &quot;You&#39;re ... driving ... me ...ohhhhhhhhh 
...&quot;
        
        Jura pulled her tongue out and flicked it over Keia&#39;s clit 
experimentally. Seeing the pleasant reaction, Jura then kissed the tiny 
nub softly. She heard a throaty, guttural moan from Keia, and became 
fascinated with the small bundle of nerves. She flicked her tongue over 
it again, then placed her lips back on it and sucked softly.
        
        &quot;THERE!&quot; Keia moaned. &quot;Don&#39;t ... ohhhhhhh ... stop doing 
THAAAAAT!&quot; Keia writhed under Jura&#39;s expert ministrations. She bucked 
her hips and grasped Jura&#39;s head in-between her thighs. &quot;Ohhhhhhh 
GODDESS that feels gooooooooood!&quot;
        
        Jura kept sucking on Keia&#39;s sensitive clit, and drew her right 
index finger up her slick and sensitive pussy lips. She parted them, and 
probed the moist outer folds slowly. She pushed past Keia&#39;s outer lips 
slowly, and deeper into the flesh of Keia&#39;s pussy. Sucking on her clit 
and slowly thrusting a finger in and out of Keia&#39;s pussy, Jura was 
sending Keia closer and closer to a massive orgasm.
        
        &quot;JURA!&quot; Keia gasped at the penetration. &quot;Ohhhhhhhhh GODDSSSSSSS. 
DON&quot;T YOU DARE STOP!&quot; Keia thrust her hips against Jura&#39;s hand, matching 
the pace and rhythm of the thrusts. &quot;I&#39;m getting close,&quot; she panted. She 
closed her eyes, feeling the intense pressure building in her gut like a 
tsunami. She panted and thrust herself on Jura&#39;s fingers harder. She 
grunted and let a primal growl escape at Jura&#39;s addition of her middle 
finger and the flick of the tongue over her clit. &quot;I&#39;m gonna ... 
ohhhhhhhhh GODDESS ... I&#39;m gonna cum!&quot; Keia screeched as her climax tore 
through her. At her peak, sigil of flame glowed a bright red on her 
forehead while a faint glow of the same hue enveloped her body at the.

	Jura&#39;s hand became drenched with Keia&#39;s release. She lapped up 
what she could, licking Keia&#39;s pussy and thighs clean. Keia&#39;s spasming 
stopped, and with them, the flow of juices and the fading of the sigil 
and aura. Jura then lifted her hand to her mouth and repeated the 
cleaning process. &quot;Mmmmm ... that was good. How do you feel?&quot;

	Keia&#39;s eyes were rolled back in their sockets and her breathing 
was short and ragged. &quot;That ... was ... that was unbelievable!&quot; she 
proclaimed. &quot;I&#39;ve never had an orgasm like that!&quot;

	Jura laughed lightly. &quot;You okay now? That should have been 
exhausting!&quot;

	&quot;It was,&quot; Keia replied, glowing, &quot;but I&#39;ve still got some energy 
left in me.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sure you do,&quot; Jura said smiling. &quot;C&#39;mon we&#39;d better clean 
up.&quot;

	&quot;Not just yet,&quot; Keia said, smiling mischievously. &quot;You&#39;ve been 
kind enough to me, and you&#39;re MY guest. What kind of hostess doesn&#39;t 
return the favor!?&quot; Keia made her move quickly, pinning Jura to the 
floor by her wrists. &quot;It&#39;s your turn, and fair play&#39;s fair play.&quot;

	Jura feigned distress, barely fighting Keia&#39;s restraining hands. 
She wiggled against her experimentally, pleased with the resulting 
stimulation. She was already wet and she wanted Keia to return the 
torture she had given her.

	Keia was grinning like the Cheshire cat, and she dove for Jura&#39;s 
lips hungrily. Jura returned the kiss, giving Keia the same fiery 
passion she was getting. Keia broke the kiss moving down to kiss Jura&#39;s 
chin then the base of her jaw, up to her ear, blowing in it gently, and 
causing a small quiver in Jura&#39;s body. Keia drew her teeth over the 
lobe, listening to the purr rising from Jura&#39;s throat. She released 
Jura&#39;s ear and kissed her way down to the hollow at the base of Jura&#39;s 
neck, giving it the same treatment as Jura&#39;s ear. Moving on, Keia place 
a triad of long kisses on Jura&#39;s collarbone, then dragged her tongue 
down do the firm orbs of flesh that rose and fell sharply with each 
ragged breath. She raked her nails over the flesh gently, cause Jura to 
shudder and grunt.

	&quot;This ... is payback ... isn&#39;t it?&quot; Jura hissed. &quot;You ... vixen!&quot;

	&quot;You bet,&quot; Keia growled primally, flicking her tongue over Jura&#39;s 
left nipple, and pinching the right with her fingers. Jura writhed 
lifting her hands to Keia&#39;s head, raking her nails through her scalp. 
Keia, nibbled on the nipple in her lips, flicking her tongue over it 
after each. She took her mouth off and mirrored her actions on the right 
nipple. She kneaded the left with her hand, drawing her thumb over the 
nipple several times. She pushed the two breasts together and gave the 
nipples a final kiss, releasing the orbs after. She then repositioned 
herself and began her trail of kisses down Jura&#39;s abdomen.

        Mimicking all of Jura&#39;s earlier actions, she finally reached the 
patch of short amber hair above Jura&#39;s core. Keia inhaled Jura&#39;s scent, 
savoring the musky quality. She rubbed her right palm over the soft 
patch, using her left to part Jura&#39;s thighs. She lowered her head, 
inhaling the scent once more, then placed a soft, promising kiss on 
Jura&#39;s swollen clit.
        
        Jura pushed her hips forward to meet Keia&#39;s mouth, moaning 
expectantly. Keia granted herself the pleasure of using her tongue to 
part Jura&#39;s engorged pussy lips, savoring the sweet taste of Jura&#39;s 
wetness. Wrapping her long arms around Jura&#39;s pelvic area, Keia used 
them to hold Jura against her mouth and tongue. Keia folded her tongue, 
then pushed it into Jura&#39;s pussy. She raked the tip of her tongue over 
the moist flesh experimentally, and all Jura did was clamp her thighs, 
and moan incoherently.
        
        &quot;Mmmmm ... ohhhhhhhh ... ahhhhhhhhh ... GODS your GOOD!&quot; Jura 
panted throatily. &quot;THERE, lick there ... aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh that&#39;s it 
... ooooooooh.&quot;
        
        As the pressure in Jura&#39;s gut built, a faint ice-blue glow 
surrounded her, and a small crystalline sigil began to glow dimly on her 
forehead. Keia continued her pleasing ministrations, unaware of this. 
Keia pulled her tounge out of Jura&#39;s slick pussy, clamping her lips down 
on Jura&#39;s clit and sucking madly. Jura bucked her hips and guttural 
moans grew deeper. Keia unwrapped her left arm, and used her long, 
tapering fingers on Jura&#39;s labia. She drew her nails over the soft, 
sensitive flesh a few times, then plunged her first two fingers deep 
into Jura&#39;s slick core. Jura dug her nails into Keia&#39;s scalp, thrusting 
into her hand as much as Keia would allow. Jura&#39;s orgasm hit her hard 
and fast, sending spasms through her lithe figure, and soaking Keia&#39;s 
chins and hand. As Jura&#39;s climax faded slowly, so did the glow of her 
aura and sigil. Keia released Jura and sat on her knees.
        
        &quot;Keia ... goddess&#39;,&quot; Jura panted. &quot;No words can describe that 
orgasm.&quot;
        
        &quot;There is more, for the both of us,&quot; Keia purred throatily. 
&quot;Think you can survive another orgasm, with enough energy to shower and 
dress?&quot;
        
        &quot;I&#39;ll manage,&quot; Jura laughed, &quot;as long as it&#39;s your fault I&#39;m 
drained.&quot;
        
        Keia laughed too, moving herself over Jura straddling her 
pelvis. &quot;This is the first time I&#39;ve done this, so ...&quot; Keia admitted. 
She lowered her still wet pussy until it touched the slick lips of 
Jura&#39;s. She thrust her hips forward slowly, causing friction between 
their clits. Jura released a cry of lust and pure rapture. They fell 
into rhythm quickly, thrusting their hips against each other lustfully. 
They were moaning and grunting, both of them building towards the 
largest and most satisfying orgasms of their lives. As their soared into 
the realms of pure pleasure, the bright aura of fire around Keia, and 
the brighter aura of ice around Jura mingled. They created a new, more 
substantial aura of a deep, clear emerald. Their sigils glowed brighter 
than they had during the first orgasm, and they quickly filled the room 
with their power and lust.
        
        &quot;Jura ... I&#39;m ... I&#39;m about to ... GODDESS I&#39;M GONNA CUM!&quot; Keia 
shrieked, thrusting madly against Jura.
        
        &quot;GODDESS&#39; I&#39;M CUMMING TOO!!!!!!!!&quot; Jura wailed with her release.
        
        As their orgasms ripped through their bodies, the room was 
filled with the bright glow the emerald aura. They collapsed against 
floor and each other after their orgasms subsided. Their sigils and 
auras didn&#39;t fade away, but dimmed to a calm red, and placid blue. They 
lay on the floor, complete sated and sexually exhausted. They kissed 
lightly after resting for a moment.
        
        &quot;Jura, that was amazing,&quot; Keia exclaimed in a whisper. &quot;I&#39;ve 
never felt this happy. I love you so much.&quot;
        
        &quot;Amazing isn&#39;t the word love,&quot; Jura whispered back. &quot;Happy 
doesn&#39;t cover it either. And I love you just as much.&quot;
        
        &quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Keia said, smiling wistfully. &quot;Let&#39;s take our 
shower and mop up the evidence of tonight off of the floor.&quot;
        
        &quot;Will you bathe me? I&#39;m exhausted,&quot; Jura whined. &quot;I don&#39; think I 
can even walk.&quot;
        Keia laughed and hefted her lanky self onto her feet. &quot;I warned 
you didn&#39;t I? You&#39;ll listen for now on won&#39;t you.&quot; Keia stated lovingly. 
She pulled Jura&#39;s drained form off of the floor and held her close. 
&quot;Now, we&#39;ll work together to clean ourselves and our mess.&quot;
        
--------------------------------------

	Three floors up from Keia&#39;s room, Kara and Mitsuko lay holding 
each other on Kara&#39;s couch. They were watching a DVD, and eating popcorn 
from a large bowl on the floor. Mitsuko sighed wistfully and Kara kissed 
the back of her neck. Kara inhaled the scent of jasmine and rosemary 
from Mitsuko&#39;s hair and smiled.

	&quot;I wonder what Jura and Keia are doing?&quot; Mitsuko pondered to her 
girlfriend. &quot;They haven&#39;t called, and it&#39;s been over 40 minutes.&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m sure they found something to keep them busy,&quot; Kara mused 
playfully.

	&quot;You eechi!&quot; Mitsuko cooed with a laugh.

	As they wrestled on the couch, the sigils of wind and water lit up 
dimly and went unnoticed on their foreheads. They felt a slight tingle 
and the stopped moving, looking at each other carefully.

	&quot;You felt that too?&quot; Mitsuko whispered.

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kara breathed. &quot;What was it?&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Mitsuko said in reply.
