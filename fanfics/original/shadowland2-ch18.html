<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 18 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Natalie sat on the ground in front of her bed with her head rested upon 
the mattress, her jacket tossed upon the desk chair, Madonna&#39;s voice 
poured out of the CD player and a dagger slowly spun between her 
fingers. She scanned the yellowish marks that cut across her the flesh 
of her arms, a simple scratch now, but a constant reminder how much 
Kimberly had endeared over the last while. Her mind returned to the 
first time she had met Alyson. 

(Because we are the same.)

Those were the only words that Natalie ever got out of Alyson about her 
own wounds. Natalie should have known there was much more for the girl 
was always waking up with bruises and cuts all over here body. Natalie 
has always wondered who Alyson could have been linked too, however every 
time she tried to bring up the subject Alyson would find some way to 
avoid the question. Now Natalie felt so stupid, she had seen the way the 
Alyson reacted around her brother and always dismissed it as nothing. 
Now that she thought about it she was not sure if it was love or fear 
that Alyson showed for her brother. Natalie was so deep in her thoughts 
that she did not notice as Kimberly crept into the room until the girl 
had spoke. 

&quot;Natalie?&quot; The redhead softly probed. 

Natalie blinked up at her friend, &quot;Kim?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kim apologized as she nervously fiddled with the hem of her 
skirt, &quot;You didn&#39;t answer and I was worried so...&quot; She gazed down at her 
toes, unable to look at her friend for some unknown reason. 

&quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; Natalie said and patted the ground next to her, &quot;Have a 
seat.&quot; 

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Kim asked as she gingerly tucked her skirt under herself 
then sat down with her knees curled up close to her chest.

&quot;I guess so....&quot; Natalie could not get over how much different Kim and 
Kima were, not just the fact that Kim had long hair and Kima cut hers 
short, but ever since the incident with the woods Kim seemed to be 
shying away from Natalie, more so when her twin was hanging around. 
Natalie wondered what had happened to Kim to change her so much; in the 
past she would curl up next to Natalie under a tree and cuddle into her. 
The woods only showed a fraction of the girl&#39;s nightmares. What else 
could be haunting her mind? Not even Kima was willing to talk much about 
the past. Natalie&#39;s mind raced as she tired to think of what to say to 
this girl whom used to be her closest, no, her only friend. Just as she 
was about to get the courage to speak the CD player switched tracks and 
Madonna started to sing &quot;Promise to try&quot; and Kim&#39;s head rose ever so 
slightly and entire body froze in place. &quot;What is it?&quot; Natalie inquired 
aware that something had set Kim on edge. 

Kim clenched her knees tightly to her chest, &quot;Could you turn it off?&quot; 
She mumbled into her knees.

Natalie was startled by the request, she was almost sure she heard the 
girl wrong, &quot;Turn it off?&quot; She inquired slightly confused, Natalie was 
almost certain that Madonna was the girl&#39;s favourite singer before she 
vanished. She had not really been paying much attention to the music, it 
was just background because the silence was maddening.  

Kim set her chin upon her knees, &quot;It&#39;s just reminds me... of Lauren....&quot; 
She explained in a thin voice 

&quot;Lauren?&quot; Natalie inquired, she had to think for a moment, the name rung 
a bell for some reason. 

&quot;She saved me when I ran away.&quot; Kim stated weakly.

Natalie suddenly remembered Kima mentioning something about Lauren that 
the girl had died... Natalie turned to the stereo as Madonna&#39;s voice 
drifted through the room. 

&#39;Will she see me cry when I stumble and fall
Does she hear my voice in the night when I call
Wipe away all your te-.&#39;

Quickly Natalie did as she was requested and switched the player off, 
plunging the room into complete silence. She never realized before just 
how depressing that song really was until that moment and felt ashamed 
for not realizing that it was affecting her friend. Natalie turned to 
see the muscles in Kim&#39;s shoulders began to relax ever so slightly. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Kim muttered softly, &quot;I came to cheer you up and I can&#39;t 
even do that.&quot; 

&quot;Lauren must have been someone very special to you.&quot; Natalie noted. 

Tears filled Kim&#39;s eyes, &quot;I miss her so much.&quot; She sobbed, &quot;Every time I 
sleep I keep hoping that she will be next to me in the morning. Smiling 
down at me. Wrapping her arms around me to keep me warm.&quot; Kim shuddered 
against the sobs.  

Natalie knelt beside the girl, reached out to touch her upon the head, 
only to have her slightly cringe away and hug her knees even tighter. 
Natalie simple sat down beside the girl not wanting to distress the girl 
anymore, &quot;What happened to her? Where have you been all this time? Kima 
told me she died, but nothing more.&quot; 

Kim leaned her head back against the bed, &quot;I don&#39;t know where we were. 
It was like here, but wasn&#39;t at the same time.&quot; Kim explained thinking 
back to the day she ran away, &quot;I remember finding my parents...&quot; She 
shook the bloody image from her head, not wanting to think about that. 

&quot;I saw them too.&quot; Natalie admitted, &quot;I went to your house right after 
school. I was really looking forward to that sleep over.&quot; She remarked 
with a weak grin. 

&quot;Kima... killed him...&quot; Kim stated dismally, rubbing at her forehead 
with the palm of her hand, &quot;He... was angry about you sleeping over and 
hit mommy... hard...&quot; Tears rolled down her face and she sobbed, 
&quot;Sh...she hit her head on a table... and didn&#39;t... move...&quot; She grabbed 
Natalie&#39;s sleeve and let out a tired wail, &quot;He came after me and... 
Kima... she....&quot;

&quot;Shhhhh...&quot; Natalie soothed her friend, &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; 

&quot;No! It isn&#39;t.&quot; Kim mumbled through the sobs, &quot;I&#39;m scared Nat...&quot; She 
looked Natalie in the eyes, there was an intense fear in those eyes, 
&quot;I&#39;m afraid she may kill someone again.&quot;
