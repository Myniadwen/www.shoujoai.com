<p>Director: Okay, quiet on the set, people. We’re on in  thirty. If the contestants would take their place…uh-huh. And the  host… All right, good. We’re clear to go. Cue the theme song.  Cameras rolling in three…two…one.</p>
<p>Emcee: Wuuuhelcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the  galaxy’s FAAAYYY-VORITE game show! This is a show that pulls out  ALL the stops to create the most THRILLING, most EXCITING, most  EEE-LECTRIFYING game show ever! We even have our very own LIVE studio  audience!

<p>Audience: YOU BET!</p>
<p>Emcee: Are you ready to cheer our fabulous contestants  on to victory?!</p>
<p>Audience: YOU BET!</p>
<p>Emcee: Are you ready to see them put everything on the  line for the sake of glory and riches?!</p>
<p>Audience: YOU BET!</p>
<p>Emcee: All right! That’s what I like to hear! Ladies  and gentlemen, studio audience, viewers at home and around the  galaxy, and our brave contestants! ARE WE READY TO PLAY?!?!?</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“YOU BET YOUR LIFE!!: the deadly fun galactic  game show!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Emcee: All RIGHT! Let’s get this game started! But  first, let’s make introductions! As always, I am your fabulous  host, Emcee Etcher!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Thank you, thank you! Our contestants for  today hail from all OVER the galaxy! First off, let’s give a warm  welcome to ASERIA TOLAN, who comes ALL the way from Alfheim! Aseria  is the daughter of Valorien, Emperor of the Sindarin Empire, and one  of the wealthiest and most influential people in the galaxy! Great to  have you with us, Aseria!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>Aseria: Hey, what the hell is going on?!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Next, we have the lovely SHANA SUING, hailing  from Epitaph! She’s a cute young woman with an astounding IQ and a  lot of devotion to her family, especially her younger brother Alan.  Let’s give her a hand, shall we?</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>Shana: Where are we? How did we get here? One minute  we’re on our ship, and the next…</p>
<p>MC Etcher: I’m sorry, Shana, but all questions must be  held until the end of the show. Moving along, our next daring  contestant is a fabulous winged woman from New London! It’s REBECCA  HILL! Her aunt is the famous bounty hunter Shandra Hill, while her  father is a renowned geneticist and professor! Let’s hope these  skills have passed onto her!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>Rebecca: Wow, this is really screwed up right here.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Our next contestant hails from Onogoro, an  idyllic world where Kitsune have made their home. She loves anime,  healing the sick, and a certain Usagin warrior who— JUST—  couldn’t be with us today! Let’s say hello to FUUKA FUJIWARA!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>Fuuka: I think I’ve seen something like this before.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: And finally, our fifth contestant is a  prudent, cautious, jittery little thing from a planet whose name I  can’t say out loud for fear that I might get sued!</p>
<p>Audience: (laughter)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Don’t let her size and bald head fool you!  Put your hands together for the wild card of the group, VIMMY  FONESTER!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>Vimmy: Have we been kidnapped, or abducted, oh please, I  couldn’t suffer another probing, I do hope I’ll be all right,  listen you, mister Emcee, I can pay whatever ransom you want, I’ve  got more money than you can imagine, perhaps we can strike a d—</p>
<p>MC Etcher: All questions must be saved until the end of  the program, Vimmy! Now that introductions are made, it’s time to  play…</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: The rules of the game are very simple! The  five of you must cooperate by answering questions that I ask! They’ll  range from multiple choice, fill in the blank, guess who, and true or  false, and maybe a few special bonus rounds if we have enough time!  Won’t that be super?</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: There is a twist, however. I know what you’re  thinking! “Emcee Etcher, we already have more money and prizes than  we can ever HOPE to possess! What could you possibly give us that  we’d want?” A fair question, my friends. The answer is simple: we  have not one but TWO things that every person simply CAN’T go  without! The first is, of course, the truth!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: And the second… Well, we can’t just give  you the truth for free, now can we? I mean, all participants have to  pay some kind of fee, right? And for this game show, the stakes are  as high as they come! For some you wager money, for others, your  belongings! But only on this game show…WHAT ARE THEY BETTING,  STUDIO AUDIENCE?!</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: That’s right, ladies and gentlemen! Your  lives are literally on the line! If you cannot answer a certain  amount of questions by the end of the program, you’ll lose your  lives! Won’t that be a hoot? However, if you win, then yours truly  will be forced to let you go free, and I’ll face TOTAL ANNIHILATION  instead!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>Rebecca: Yup, completely screwed up.</p>
<p>Shana: Do we have to?</p>
<p>MC Etcher: OH, I’m SORRY, but frankly, you either take  your chances or we TAKE YOUR LIVES! But don’t worry: the odds are  on your side! Surely between the five of you, you can answer enough  questions to survive— plus, you might walk away with some real  knowledge! But I wouldn’t count on it! None of our other  contestants ever made it, did they, studio audience?</p>
<p>Audience: (laughing)</p>
<p>Fuuka: I think you just contradicted yourself.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: I did? Really?</p>
<p>(crickets chirping)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Oh well! Now that we know the stakes, let’s  get this game started! But first, let’s have a word from our  sponsors so our contestants can prepare. They’re going to need it!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>MC Etcher: AND WE’RE BACK! Welcome back to “You Bet  Your Life”, the rip-roaring HILL-ARIOUS game show where you put  YOUR life on the line!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: We’re just about to begin the first round  of questions and answers! Contestants, are you ready?</p>
<p>Rebecca: Do we have a choice?</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Wonderful! Let the games begin! Contestants,  good luck!</p>
<p>(suspenseful theme music plays)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: During the reign of King Solomon,  macro-organic entities called the Ifrit were created to mimic the  appearance and ability of the Angels, but they proved to be a poor  imitation. WHAT symbol of King Solomon are they bound to obey?</p>
<p>Fuuka: Um, oh dear. This was never in any anime.</p>
<p>Vimmy: Of course it wasn’t, I don’t even know what  the heck he’s talking about, and really, how DID we come to be in  this strange place, ah, Mr. Etcher, how much time do we have to  answer?</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Thirty seconds.</p>
<p>Vimmy: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear…</p>
<p>Aseria: I think I know this one. Rachel’s an Ifrit,  isn’t she? Doesn’t Amy have something that controls her?</p>
<p>Fuuka: Yes, she does! I remember seeing it! It was a  ring! Mr. Etcher, our answer is “ring”!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Are you sure? Is that your decision? Well,  you’d be ABSOLUTELY…CORRECT! Yes, the Ring of Solomon can control  any genie, Ifrit, djinn, or other macro-organic creature! Our  contestants score!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: The game’s off to a great start, folks.  Let’s move on to the next question. …Speaking of the Ifrit, they  were gradually wiped out or released over the eons, and now only a  handful remain. How many genies are there left in the universe?</p>
<p><strong>A: 1B: 5C: 20D: 50</strong></p>
<p>Shana: Um, Aseria, do you know?</p>
<p>Aseria: How the hell would I know that? You’re the one  with the perfect memory here!</p>
<p>Shana: I don’t think I ever remember hearing anybody  say this!</p>
<p>Fuuka: Look, if none of us knows for sure, let’s just  guess.</p>
<p>Rebecca: But you know what will happen if we get too  many questions wrong! This freak-show lounge lizard is serious!</p>
<p>Vimmy: Listen, we don’t have to guess them all, but  let’s go for a likely answer here, we know that Rachel’s a genie,  I think our answer should be “A: one”.</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>Audience: Aww…</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ooooh, I’m SORRY, that’s incorrect! Care  to try again?</p>
<p>Vimmy: Blast, ah, make it “C: twenty!”</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Whoa, twenty? We’d be in trouble in there  were that many wandering around! While there were twenty-four to  begin with, I’m afraid that the correct answer is “B: five”.  There are only five genies in existence right now!</p>
<p>Rebecca: Way to go, Vimmy.</p>
<p>Aseria: Yeah, now we have another reason to hate you.</p>
<p>Vimmy: But how was I supposed to know, Amy’s the  expert, not me, I don’t know the first thing about Ifrit, I thought  they were just legend until rec—</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Uhh, let’s move on to our next question,  all right? …The deranged cross-dressing killer Ferocious is  regarded as the galaxy’s second-best assassin, after Barbarossa.  Before he went OUTTA CONTROL, which alias did he go by?</p>
<p>Aseria: …No idea.</p>
<p>Rebecca: Johnny?</p>
<p>Fuuka: Musashi Miyamoto?</p>
<p>Shana: Trick question!</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: OH, I’m sorry! Before his mind got  completely warped by Origin, Ferocious was best known as Siegfried,  son of Sigmund, legendary defender of Chihuahua! Since his father was  able to wield eight swords at once, it only stands to reason that  Siegfried would be able to do the same!</p>
<p>Aseria: Yeah, like we would really know that!</p>
<p>Rebecca: Although I think I remember Sati telling me  about that legend before.</p>
<p>Aseria: Oh yeah? Well why didn’t you say so AT THE  BEGINNING?!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Our contestants aren’t doing so well, and  the stress is taking its toll. Let’s see if we can’t SHAKE THINGS  UP a little with this next question! …Name the exploration squad  that legendary Lennethium discoverer participated in. You’ll even  get bonus points if you can name all thirteen crewmembers!</p>
<p>Shana: This one’s easy! They were called Squad  Reliable, and their team consisted of Lenneth Coral, of course,  Carlisle Renchina, Shiho Tsukei, Ivy Stellway, Ellen Astor, Dulcine  Dutore, Wendy Laval, Chelsea McGowan, Raven Bronson, Trina Mack,  Clarissa Astor, the Follower, and Mika Johansson.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Like a bolt from the blue, our contestants  have just gained some SERIOUS ground with that one! I bet they’re  glad to have little Shana with them!</p>
<p>Shana: Hee-hee-hee, all right!!</p>
<p>Rebecca: Yeah, you really saved our bacon, Shan.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: All right, let’s move on to the next  question! Name the two main factions involved in Gaea’s last war!</p>
<p>Vimmy: Oh, oh, I definitely know this one, I promise I  do, ladies, I heard it from a merchant friend of mine who was  acquainted with some of the survivors of that war, Mr. Etcher, it was  Blue Flower and Mimir!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: COMPLETELY CORRECT! Yes, before Gaea was the  peaceful and diverse planet we all know and love, it was a war-torn  shell overrun with large armored monstrosities called Gigantes who  fought each other over possession of the planet! But thanks to the <em>Pax Terran</em> and the hard work of millions of people, Gaea is  safe from all civil war!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Next question! …What question are we on?</p>
<p>Shana: Six!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: CORRECT! This is the sixth question!  Excellent memory!</p>
<p>Shana: Tee heehee.</p>
<p>Aseria: Urgh, this is an insult.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Now get ready for a hard one! …Name the  three relics of Avalon that are supposed to bring perfect harmony.  I’ll give you a hint! Sharyn was looking for them!</p>
<p>Fuuka: Um, Shana, I hate to keep asking you if you know  all these, but…well, my memory seems to have escaped me! Ah! Mr.  Etcher, I know one was the Standard of Andvari.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ahuh…</p>
<p>Aseria: The other was the Claiohm Solais, or the Sword  of Light. I’ll never forget THAT.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ahuh…</p>
<p>Rebecca: And I know that Kyrie will never shut up about  how she lost the Breath of Vulcan!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: ALL ANSWERS ARE CORRECT! That’s right:  these three mystical items are said to bring prosperity and fortune  to whoever possesses them! Unfortunately, two of the three were  destroyed, while a green-skinned sex fiend possesses the last one.  How kooky is that?!</p>
<p>Audience: (laughter)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: It looks like you’re finally picking up  steam here, contestants! But we still have a lot of questions to  answer, and plenty of truths to uncover, so LET’S MOVE ON! …Which  species first introduced faster-than-light travel, powered by  hyperdrive fuel, to the Gaeans, thus propelling them into space?</p>
<p>Shana: That’s silly, you already asked that! …Sort  of. Anyway, it’s the Mer-folk.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Correct! Another point for our brave  heroines! …Excluding the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em>, how many  people have been permitted to land on Venus?</p>
<p>Rebecca: Um, two?</p>
<p>Vimmy: Seven!</p>
<p>Aseria: None! No, wait— just one!</p>
<p>Shana: Darn it, Amy never told us. Um, uh…eleven!</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>Audience: Aww…</p>
<p>MC Etcher: I am sorry, ladies, but those were some  AWESOME guesses! The correct answer is “six”! Oris Pendragon,  Elijah, Enoch, two men from Gaea whom history has forgotten—  although we believe one was a Pendragon— and Barbarossa the first.</p>
<p>Fuuka: More people we don’t know!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: That is kind of the point of this game. We  give you the truth and YOU give us your lives!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Well, it looks like it’s time for a  commercial break, but don’t you go anywhere! When we come back: do  these five contestants have what it takes to survive? Can they answer  any more questions, or have they met their match? And what about the  lightning round? All this and more in the next segment of…</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Welcome back to even more CUH-RAYZEE antics  and SHOCKING moments of truth! It’s a quest for knowledge at the  expense of the lives of FIVE CONTESTANTS! All this and more on the  galaxy’s FAY-VORITE game show…</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Is everybody ready to play the next round?</p>
<p>Audience: YOU BET!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: And what about our contestants, are they  ready to put their lives ON THE LINE for fabulous truth?!</p>
<p>Aseria: Uh…I guess. I mean, if we have to…</p>
<p>Fuuka: I don’t understand why we’re talking this way  and not using quotes like normal.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ahahaha, easy with the “fourth-wall humor”  there, Doc! Okay, let’s keep going! We’ve got a lot of truths to  cover and not much time! But before we move onto the next round, our  executive producer is telling me it’s time for…</p>
<p>Everybody: THE LIGHTNING ROUND!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Yes, it’s the lightning round! Questions  are going to come at you LEFT AND RIGHT! Guess correctly and you win!  But one false move could be the end! Are you ready to play?  WONDERFUL! Let’s open the shutters and let loose those fiery-hot  questions! First, who originally created the <em>Dauntless</em>?</p>
<p>Rebecca: Wasn’t it some race beyond the galaxy?</p>
<p>Vimmy: No, my race did, or at least we will be, once we  start buying the rights, I tell you, we’ll make a fortune with our  superior knockoffs!</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: SO…VERY…SORRY, everyone! The answer we’re  looking for is “Numenoreans”. Believe it or not, Oris’s people  made the <em>Dauntless</em>, or at least its designs. A friendly  ancient race beyond our galaxy visited Gaea right before the last Ice  Age, taking the plans and leaving something behind! What was it?  Gosh, even I don’t know! Humans, perhaps? But who cares, let’s  move on, shall we? Where was the most recent Space Race held?</p>
<p>Shana: Centania! And we came in third place!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Correct-a-mundo! Who is the CURRENT Angel of  Death?</p>
<p>Aseria: I won’t forget that name! She tried to kill MY  Lillith— I mean, my <em>Lillianne</em>! Her name is Grave but her  real name is Arine Laval!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! Thanatos, the previous  Angel of Death, gave his powers to Laval and went into retirement!!  It might also be interesting to know that Miss Laval is the  clone-daughter of famous Squad Reliable crewmember, Wendy Laval!!  Who’d a-thunk it?! Moving on, what lost language is Marsa Rosemont  and Oris Pendragon fluent in?</p>
<p>Rebecca: Um…</p>
<p>Shana: Don’t look at me!</p>
<p>Aseria: Swahili?</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ohh, I’m sorry! The correct answer is “Old  Solar”! This is the language everyone in the Solar System spoke  before the Tower of Babel was built, including the ancient Martians,  the modern Venusians, most Numenorenas, AND EVEN the Sulvites! Next  question! Captain Barbarossa, aka Hendrick van der Decken, has been  alive for HOW long?</p>
<p>Vimmy: A thousand years!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: CORRECT! Being cursed into a life of  immortality can do that to ya! And now for our final lightning round  question! Not counting Rachel, how many women were originally a  crewmember of the Dauntless?</p>
<p>Fuuka: I remember this one! It was fifty-seven!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: COMPLETELY CORRECT! Among those you lost were  Changera the Doppelganger! What a great lightning round that was!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Now it’s time for a segment I like to call…</p>
<p>Everybody: GUESS WHAT!!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: That’s right! Just as the title indicates,  you will be shown a pixilated photograph of a mysterious person you  may have heard something about. It’ll be up to YOU to guess who or  what that person is BEFORE the picture clears up! Win and you  advance! Lose, and…well, I just hope you’ve got good life  insurance!</p>
<p>Audience: (laughter)</p>
<p>(a blurry picture is shown)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: All right, let’s play! So what is this? You  get five guesses and only one hint! You’ve definitely heard about  him, but he was using a different name! Can you guess?</p>
<p>Fuuka: Um…it looks like one of the Angels from <em>Evangelion</em>, but I’m not sure which… Nope, can’t think of  anything.</p>
<p>Vimmy: Drat, I’ve never seen this before, it’s too  blurry, I’d warrant it’s the Regent of our race, but I don’t  think he’d be that hard to identify, let’s see now, umm, nope, I  have no idea.</p>
<p>Rebecca: Is it…my father?</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Oooh, I’m sorry! The correct answer is  “Boole, Origin’s right-hand man”. You once heard about him  during the Space Race, but he was using the name “Nemo Nephale”!</p>
<p>Shana: Darn it, I knew there was something fishy about  that name…</p>
<p>(another blurry picture shows)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Second chance! You’ve definitely seen his  children all over the place!</p>
<p>Fuuka: It looks like a Fog Ninja.</p>
<p>DING!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Close enough! This is actually the MASTER Fog  Ninja, the enormous, all-powerful father of them all! He’s big as a  mountain and meaner than a volcano! But kill him and all the others  will disappear forever!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: All RIGHT! Last one! You’ve seen this  lordly executive’s nephew show the universe a thing or two during  the race. WHO IS…this man?</p>
<p>(the final blurry picture shows)</p>
<p>Aseria: I can recognize him already! He and my father  were once business associates! That’s Lord Maoska Demise of Demise  Industries!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: COMPLETELY CORRECT! What a FAN-TABULOUS round  that was! Now it’s time for another commercial break, but when we  come back, it’s time to GUESS WHO I AM! …Uh, no, not who <em>I</em> am! You already know that one!</p>
<p>Audience: (dead silent)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: …………Uh, right. Anyway, don’t you  touch that dial! We’ll be back before you can say…</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>MC Etcher: And we’re back! And not a moment too soon!  My producers are telling me that if I don’t hurry up, I’m going  to lose my head! And from the looks of that guillotine standing over  in the corner, they could be serious!</p>
<p>Audience: (laughter)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Let’s not disappoint them, okay? In this  round, you only have to guess who ONE person is, and you even get a  set of hints along the way! The sooner you guess who it is, the MORE  points you’ll be able to get! However, if you can’t guess even at  the very end, one of us will be that much closer…to a beheading!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>Shana: Is that studio audience even real?</p>
<p>Aseria: Kid, none of this is real.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Let’s get right down to it! Um, Miss Hill,  could you please step forward? You’re going to be our special  participant!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>Rebecca: Do I have to?</p>
<p>Audience: (laughter)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: I’m afraid so. It’s a ratings thing.</p>
<p>Rebecca: Oh, all right. I guess if I have to… So bring  it on!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: I like your spirit! The first hint is,  “nobody knows what I really look like”. Oooh, not off to a great  start, are we? If nobody knows what this thing looks like, how will  YOU know? Maybe this might help: “I’m related to royalty”.  Think about Kings, Queens, Emperors, that sort of thing. Still  nothing? Next hint! “I have amazing powers.” They can do things  no normal creature can! That might not mean much to YOUR crew…I  mean, you DO have someone in your team that’s died like…five  times.</p>
<p>Aseria: Hey!!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Still nothing? Not even a guess? Okay, next  hint! “I’m fluent in many languages”. It looks like no matter  where they go, they know exactly what everyone’s talking about!  This is one character that doesn’t need an interpreter! Oh, and it  looks like she’s ready to guess! What’s your answer, Rebecca?</p>
<p>Rebecca: Um…Riene Latoli?</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>Audience: Aww…</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ugh, no, I’m SO SORRY. Really, does Riene  LOOK like she has super powers? And come on, you’ve seen her…naked!  If that’s not her true form, I don’t know WHAT COULD BE!</p>
<p>Rebecca: Jeez, sorry! It’s just that the language  thing threw me off.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Fair enough. Here are a few more hints to  help you out! “I’m great at deception”. Wow, you really thought  this was Riene? Heheh, won’t she have a few words for you when you  see her again?</p>
<p>Audience: (laughter)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: But seriously, you can’t trust a word they  say— or even their appearance! Next hint! “I look young, but I’m  really older than all modern civilizations”. Could this possibly be  a cutie who’s really an old hag? How about one more hint to help  you out? “I’m a leader who does things their own way”. No  matter what’s going on, this person just HAS to be in charge! Does  that remind you of someone you might know? Wow, she’s ready for  another answer!</p>
<p>Rebecca: Um…is it Changera?</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>Audience: Aww…</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Oooh, good try! Being great at deception AND  not knowing what she looks like were dead giveaways, but everyone  KNOWS the Doppelgangers don’t have any other special powers— why,  they can only see properly in infrared light! And Changera’s only  25, for Pete’s sake! But that was a good try! Now we’ll see if  you can’t get it right with the next hint! “I do my best work  through other people’s efforts”. So what they’re saying is that  they’re smart enough to make other people do the dirty work FOR  them. Sounds like a sinister character to me! Next: “you don’t  know me, but I know you”. Doesn’t that sound scary!! Apparently  the two of you are acquainted, but you don’t know it yet! Well,  we’re down to the last hint, and so far, our beautiful contestant  hasn’t been faring too well! Any words for her, Dr. Fujiwara?</p>
<p>Fuuka: Uh, yeah, is this person real, or are you just  making it up?</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ahahaha, I think it’s better if I ask the  questions here, sweetheart.</p>
<p>Audience: (laughter)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: But yes, they are very real. Rebecca Hill…are  you ready for the final hint? “I never do the same thing twice”.  Sounds like someone who just doesn’t like consistency! No matter  what they do, it’s got to be new! So, do you have any ideas? This  is your last guess!!</p>
<p>Rebecca: Um, uh…I, uh…I think it’s…uhh, Rachel  the genie!</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>Audience: Aww…</p>
<p>MC Etcher: SO…VERY…CLOSE…and yet there’s no  cigar. I’m SORRY— the correct answer is “Origin”! Yes! Origin  is all this and more! Thank you so much for playing, Miss Hill—  you’ve been a TERRIFIC sport!</p>
<p>Rebecca: Yeah, whatever… (grumbling)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>MC Etcher: OKAY! There’s just two more segments to go  in this game before the grand finale! Don’t screw up or you’ll  regret it! …That’s what she said!</p>
<p>Audience: (dead silent)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: ……Time to play!! Speaking of Origin, just  what is it?</p>
<p><strong>A: an ancient Gaean anime B: where something begins  C: Rachel in disguise D: member of a forgotten race</strong></p>
<p>Fuuka: Well, thanks to Becky-chan, we know it’s not  “C”, so…“A”?</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>Vimmy: Honestly, Fuuka, this is no time for your  obsession, it’s serious here, I would have said “D”, even  though “B” is technically correct, I’m sure there’s a Gaean  anime called <em>Origin</em> but I just don’t think that’s the  answer he was looking for.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Vimmy is correct! The answer is “D: member  of a forgotten race”! Of course, if we knew what that race WAS,  maybe we wouldn’t be in this predicament! Next question: Who  composed the Tome of Treasures?</p>
<p><strong>A: Al Gore B: millions of adventurers and researchers  C: Evil Lord Gary D: founder of Phobos and Ares Academies</strong></p>
<p>Shana: Bwah? I’m going to say “B” since it sounds  the least ridiculous.</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ooh, wrong answer! But not entirely! Although  the Tome consists of materials gathered by millions of adventurers  and researchers, it was the founder of Phobos and Ares Academies who  actually brought it all together! I suppose half credit is still  credit after all! Next question! Ten is what?</p>
<p><strong>A: a number B: the Roman equivalent of “X” C: a  state D: all the above</strong></p>
<p>Fuuka: The answer is “D: all the above”!</p>
<p>DING!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Correct! Ten is a number, the Roman  equivalent of X, AND a state! Get it? Ten is “C”! Tennessee!</p>
<p>Audience: (dead silent)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: ……Hoo, tough crowd!</p>
<p>Shana: Gosh, Fuji-san, how’d you know THAT question?</p>
<p>Fuuka: Oh, I had a weird teacher who always made that  joke when it came time to take tests. He always made sure that the  tenth question was answered by “C” so that everyone would get at  least one point.</p>
<p>Aseria: I don’t get it.</p>
<p>Fuuka: That’s okay, nobody did.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Moving on! What famous magician first  proposed manipulating fog to create a limitless army of loyal drones?</p>
<p><strong>A: Houdini B: Merlin C: Aleazar Kazima D: Saruman</strong></p>
<p>Aseria: Now I know this one. It’s “C: Aleazar  Kazima”. I met him on a distant world on the edge of our galaxy  when I was a child. He was rather gifted for a human.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: That is correct! Although he never lived to  see his ingenious idea come to fruition, someone eventually found a  way to create loyal drones from fog! And what an army THAT would be!  Next question: Changer’s lover’s name is what?</p>
<p><strong>A: Shift B: Turner C: Sexually Ambiguous Troll D:  Morphina</strong></p>
<p>Vimmy: Now how are we supposed to know that, I’m sure  all Doppelgangers have pun-names, look at it, Change, Shift, Turn,  Morph, very droll, but we don’t know her, I never once paid  attention to her, mmm-hmm, poor people, you know.</p>
<p>Shana: Yeah, she never told us. …I’m going with “A:  Shift”.</p>
<p>BZZT!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: I’m sorry, the correct answer is “C”!  …Just kidding! It’s “D”! Apparently, Changera fit right in on  the Sapphic Cruise ship!</p>
<p>Everyone: (dead silent)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Whew, is that guillotine getting closer, or  is it just me? Let’s move on to the final multiple choice question!  Franklin Hill was researching what when he injected his daughter with  a wing-growing serum?</p>
<p><strong>A: Origin B: birds C: angels D: crystal meth</strong></p>
<p>Rebecca: ……Oh God, I wish I knew. Was it… “A:  Origin”?</p>
<p>DING!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Completely correct! Professor Hill was  researching Origin— perhaps as a way to help it, perhaps as a way  to destroy it, maybe even…to transfer Origin into a person’s  body!</p>
<p>Rebecca: WTF!! Are you saying that <em>I</em> could  be…ah…NO WAY! THAT’S FREAKING IMPOSSIBLE!!</p>
<p>Aseria: Ahh— my ears. Ow.</p>
<p>Fuuka: Mine, too. Listen, Becky, I’m sure your father  wasn’t looking into THAT. I mean, there’s no doubt that the man  was a little insane, but still! He’d never…</p>
<p>Vimmy: I’m not sure how you can say that since you  know he was responsible for Athena’s condition, he put her through  quite a lot, indeed, and for what purpose, maybe he DID want to put  Origin into a person’s body, and that training process would’ve  given him the best, yes, hmm, perhaps his daughter was just another  test subject, it sounds perfectly reasonable, yes, not a model parent  he—</p>
<p>Rebecca: Vimmy— shut…the (bleep)…up! Or I will  KILL you!</p>
<p>Vimmy: Meep.</p>
<p>Rebecca: ………I need to be alone for awhile.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Uh…yeah. Listen, maybe we SHOULD take a  commercial break! But when we come back, get ready for the FINAL  SEGMENT!! Everything’s on the line for the last barrage of  questions! WHAT new bombshells will be revealed as our brave heroines  face total destruction?! Will they survive? Will I? Only one way to  find out! Stay tuned for the conclusion of today’s edition of…</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Wuuuuuuuuuhelcome back to THE FINAL segment  of today’s program! We’ve seen our five ASTOUNDING contestants  run the gauntlet, and they’ve uncovered the truth to more questions  than ANY previous contestant! You might even say that they’re OUTTA  CON-TROL! But there’s one last round left, folks! The fate of their  lives depends on how they do in the final round! Oh, and it also  looks as if Miss Hill has composed herself over the commercial break!  Miss Hill, are YOU ready to play?</p>
<p>Rebecca: You’re going down, (bleep)!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: AAALL RIIIIIIGHT!!! Let’s play…</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: True or false: Until recently, Gaea’s moon  has always been a barren, lifeless world.</p>
<p>Shana: Easy! True!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: I’m sorry, but the answer is “false”!  Eons ago, the Moon was a lush, vibrant world full of life, but most  of its citizens sacrificed their humanity in exchange for a perfect,  clean, immortal existence! They disregarded normal practices and  destroyed half the vegetation! The remaining few fought to keep their  half healthy, but in the end, it proved too much for them to handle.  How about that, folks?</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Let’s see what the next question says! True  or false: Numenor and Atlantis are completely fictional countries.</p>
<p>Fuuka: Um, false!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Abso-tively correct! And on top of that,  they’re the exact same country! Of course, thousands of years ago,  they were totally DE-STROYED by sinking into the sea, and very few  remnants of those years still remain. It seems like you’re picking  up steam! True or false: Venus is a blasted wasteland unfit for  civilization.</p>
<p>Vimmy: That’s easy, we’ve all been there, we know  what it looks like, the answer is false, it’s Heaven in space, I  wonder how much it would cost to buy that world, but if I need to  have <em>permission</em> to go there, it would be rather ticklish  buying a copyright, oh dear…</p>
<p>MC Etcher: …Um, yeah. Actually, it’s a trick  question! Venus IS completely ravaged by the WORST this galaxy has to  offer, UNLESS you’re invited by beings that…well, for lack of a  better term, <em>consist</em> of that world. It’s all complicated,  trust me, but the POINT GOES TO YOU ANYWAAAAAAAAAY!!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>Fuuka: Ow, not again. Doesn’t this guy ever shut up?</p>
<p>Rebecca: We can <em>make </em>him shut up. Hee-hee.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Ahahahaaa, we’re having fun, aren’t we?  True or false: Oris Pendragon is the last survivor of Numenor.</p>
<p>Fuuka: That’s true, Emcee!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: And that it is! Although many Numenoreans had  descendants, Oris is the only <em>original</em> inhabitant of that  land! Next question! True or false: The founder of Phobos and Ares  Academies was kicked out due to misusing information and researching  catastrophic weapons.</p>
<p>Aseria: And this is the same person who assembled the  Tome of Treasures? I’m going to say “false”. It doesn’t sound  like something an educator would do.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: OH! I am sorry, but THE ANSWER IS TRUE!!  Although his real name has been lost to all memory, this dangerous  and brilliant man goes by another name! I’ll bet you know what I’m  talking about! That’s right, he’s BOOLE! The very same man who  hired Derian Kazcada, the Jackal, AND Changera to completely  obliterate your sorry selves! So don’t underestimate this guy,  because he’s got a WHOLE LOTTA weapons in his arsenal! Only two  more to go before we tally up the score and see who’s living and  who’s going to have a FATAL reception!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: True or false: The Fog Ninjas all come from  one massive, enormously powerful source. Wow, that’s a gimme!</p>
<p>Shana: Yeah, you already told us that! It’s true!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Pretty easy, no? And here’s the last one!  Are you ready? Am I? True or false: You all have seen Origin before.</p>
<p>Rebecca: ……Hey, what are you all looking at me for?!  I’m not Origin!! The answer’s false!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Incorrect! You HAVE seen Origin before, with  your very eyes! And what’s more, you’ve seen Origin on SEVERAL  occasions! But I can’t tell you who or what it is, since even <em>I</em> don’t know!</p>
<p>Audience: (laughter)</p>
<p>Rebecca: Me hate you.</p>
<p>MC Etcher: Hahaha, I know. Well, folks, we’ve had a  WONDERFUL game, haven’t we? Some big questions were finally  answered, and our contestants learned a lot about themselves! …Maybe  TOO much! But now it’s time to tally up the points! How many did  you get right? How many did you get wrong? Which one of us will face  complete extinction? Only ONE WAY to find out! Drum roll, please!</p>
<p>(drum roll)</p>
<p>(cymbal crash)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: IT’S A TIE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>Aseria, Rebecca, Shana, Fuuka, and Vimmy: WHAT THE  (bleep)!!!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: This is UNPRECEDENTED, folks! But we can’t  go around killing both parties, can we? …Hold on, let me ask my  producer. (Psst, Merv! What do we do in case of a tie? …Ahuh. …All  right, I get it. Okay, I guess that works. Thanks!) Okay! My producer  has told me that in the event of a tie, we’re to have…A SUDDEN  DEATH QUESTION!!!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: The Sudden Death Question is very simple! I  ask you one question and give you no hints! You all have to agree on  a single answer! If you win, YOU LIVE! But if you lose, it’s time  to FEAR the Reaper! Are you ready?</p>
<p>Aseria: Do your worst! We’re not afraid, right?</p>
<p>Vimmy: Urgh, speak for yourself, oh, my nerves, my  digestion, my poor heart, it can’t take the strain…</p>
<p>Aseria: We’re ready!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: For the grand prize of life itself,  HERE…IT…COMES!</p>
<p>(drum roll)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: What was John Milton’s name for the lair of  demons in <em>Paradise Lost</em>?</p>
<p>Aseria: Um…</p>
<p>Rebecca: Uh…</p>
<p>Shana: Hmm…</p>
<p>Vimmy: Oh dear…</p>
<p>Fuuka: …I know! I heard about this on <em>Chrono  Crusade</em>! The answer is…Pandaemonium!</p>
<p>DING-DING-DING!!!</p>
<p>MC Etcher: CONGRATULATIONS, YOU’VE WON THE GAME!!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheering and applause)</p>
<p>Aseria: Wow, Fuuka’s otaku spirit actually saved the  day.</p>
<p>Vimmy: I knew you could do it, Doctor Fujiwara, I just  knew it, I always had confidence in you, brilliant play, maybe I  should brush up on those animated programs you love, it seems they  really come in handy—</p>
<p>Shana: I know, you rock, Fuji-san!</p>
<p>Rebecca: Yeah, you saved our (bleep), doc!</p>
<p>Fuuka: Oh! Th-thank you s-so much! I’m so happy, I…I  don’t know what to do!</p>
<p>(celebratory theme music plays)</p>
<p>MC Etcher: And there you have it, folks! These five  ASTOUNDING contestants have done the impossible and proved themselves  worthy of living! They put their lives on the line and won them back  IN STYLE! Of course, that means that this is the FINAL episode, since  in just a few minutes, I am going to meet a terrifying demise! But  it’s been fun, everybody! Thank you, brave contestants! Thank you,  studio audience! And thank you, viewers from AROUND the galaxy! I  hope you enjoyed watching…</p>
<p>Everyone: YOU…BET…YOUR…LIFE!!</p>
<p>Audience: (cheers and applause as the theme song plays)</p>
<p>(the host walks over to the guillotine, puts his head  through the hole, and pulls on the cord with a big grin)</p>
<p>Aseria: …Let us never speak of this again.</p>
<p>All: Agreed!</p>
