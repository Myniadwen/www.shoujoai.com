<p align="justify"><strong>Isabella&rsquo;s   POV</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I felt the   warm heat of the sun surrounding me as I began to feel myself aroused   from my peaceful sleep. I opened my eyes slowly and the sound of small   birds singing cheerfully, greeting me. As I felt wide awake now, somehow   feeling refreshed and found myself on my bed. <strong><em>&lsquo;How did I get   here?&rsquo; </em></strong>I thought to myself but still daren&rsquo;t to get up from   the position that I was laying in. I was feeling comfortable on my bed   after such a long while. Then, remembering that Elila was here last   night, I looked around my room, from the side of my bed to the balcony&rsquo;s   window. She wasn&rsquo;t there. Did she leave as soon as I slept?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Taking a sigh,   I stretch my body as much as I could and somehow smiled giddily from   thinking of the night before&hellip;.on how Elila came and cheered me up   in such a weird way&hellip;.yet undeniably unique. I chuckled lightly thinking   again of how she was as an adorable baby wolf. <strong><em>&lsquo;Oh yes, Wolfie   suits her so well,&rsquo; </em></strong>I thought cheekily even after thinking   how she punished me with such torture that I was out of breath! Then   I think of how delicate and caring she could be&hellip;..how warm her body   warms my entire being. I blushed at that thought, wondering if Elila   ever thought that the situation was a little too intimate. And then,   I began to think on how easily aroused Elila could be by just looking   at me &ndash; I being helpless beneath her. Wearing such a thin material   of a white night gown, I should have the decency to realize on how obvious   it would show my upper body, but no. I somehow knew at that point of   time that Elila is too aroused seeing me that way, I looked at her glowing   eyes that show the sign of hunger and such lust. I should feel terrified   at that point of time, but no&hellip;I was thinking of how she would just   claim me with the state we were both in. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking   that it was a much better situation to claim me, rather than in the   lockers room earlier yesterday. And that was why, I didn&rsquo;t back down   last night for I myself found it oh-so-sexy of being claim&hellip;like that.   Then, realizing of what I just thought, I blushed furiously and covered   my face with a pillow and groaned with embarrassment. Yet my body seems   to be tingling with delight of those naughty thoughts of mine and somehow   screaming to me that they yearn for her touch. Not Melvin&rsquo;s&hellip;&hellip;but   Elila&rsquo;s. <strong><em>&lsquo;Oh God, is this the sign of mating? Am I in season   or something?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought confusingly, comparing myself with   a female wild cat<strong><em>. &lsquo;Or is this just lust of wanting to be touch   for the first time?&rsquo; </em></strong>Confusions run wildly in my mind.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Suddenly, from   a near distance I hear the sound of my mobile phone ringing. I groaned   lazily and rolled over to the side, remembering that I left my phone   on the floor. Looking at the floor to search for the phone, I found   it just where I left it last night yet I didn&rsquo;t pick the phone up   as I was a little too lazy so I checked the Caller ID. I rolled my eyes   seeing that the caller is Melvin. I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to talk   to him since our fight last night&hellip;or the guiltiness of thinking about   intimacy with another person rather than with him just now, but yet   apart of me feared that if I don&rsquo;t answer his call, he would hurt   me again. <strong><em>&lsquo;Should I or should I not answer his call?&rsquo;</em></strong> I questioned myself slowly&hellip;.debating the reasons on what will happen   if I pick up or not. Finally, I got off the bed and ignore the ringing   as I went to my bathroom and stripped off and took a hot shower. But   then my body was still warm that was given to me by Elila&rsquo;s very own   body so I turned the temperature to a warmer heat and enjoyed a satisfying   long shower. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Finally, leaving   the bathroom while drying my hair with a towel, my phone was still ringing   and I realized that Melvin was still trying to get me, but I ignored   it and continued humming softly while checking on my wardrobe, wondering   what to wear for today. Making up my mind, I pulled out a soft yellow   cardigan which has a V-shape collar and a 3rd quarter of   sleeves and matched it with faded blue comfortable jeans. I make up   my mind that I have no such mood to go out today like I always do so   I wish to dress up something comfortable and stay home with my family.   Singing lightly while dressing up, I combed my still wet hair and walked   out of the room while ignoring the continuous ringing of my phone and   went downstairs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">As I reached   downstairs, I went to look for my parents and found them in the living   room. My father was as usual, reading his favourite book while my mother   was looking through some pictures in a photo album. I happily greeted   hello and went over to my father to kiss him on the cheek and particularly   hop over to my mother and sat beside her, snuggling like a little kitten,   enjoying my mother&rsquo;s warmness. I felt my mother smiled warmly, slightly   amused of my behaviour. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Why dear,   you seem to be happy about something? Are you going out today?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;No mum,   I just want to spend time with you both. Would that be alright?&rdquo;</strong> I asked pouting slightly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I could see   my parents raising their eyebrows in surprise. Usually during the weekends,   I always seem to go out without failure. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Well,   that&rsquo;s nice dear. Why don&rsquo;t you have your breakfast first then we   could do something together?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Sure   dad!&rdquo;</strong> I said happily and jumped off the sofa and walk to the kitchen.   As I was there, little did I know that my parents were talking about   me in the living room.&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>In the Living   Room&hellip;.</strong>&nbsp;
  &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Isabella   seems to be in such a good mood today,&rdquo; </strong> said the father with a soft smile.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;yet   a little puzzling. I wonder what she could be so happy about?&rdquo; </strong> the mother said suspiciously.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Oh, perhaps   it must be that Elila came over last night to her bedroom,&rdquo;</strong> he   said confidently as he remembered last night, hearing cries of laughter   and unmistakably heard two female voices from his daughter&rsquo;s room.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila?   When did this happen? I thought they were   &lsquo;separated?&rdquo;</strong> the mother said in surprise.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t   worry. I think it was not really that long and possibly they are starting   back their friendship again.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">The mother   grows silent by this thought. Since she first heard of her daughter&rsquo;s   future partner was already destined to be with someone like Elila Savage,   good girl yet not entirely human, let&rsquo;s just say she slowly accepts   it yet fears for her daughter&rsquo;s protection as well. It saddens her   a little when she had seen Isabella trying so hard to go against that   destiny and try forcing herself to date with a boy like Melvin. Hmm,   a good boy yet she felt there is something amiss. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Do you   think&hellip;.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Hmmm&hellip;.?&rdquo;</strong> asked the father questioningly to his wife.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Do you   think that our only daughter would choose her destiny with Elila? Or   would they just be&hellip;friends?&rdquo;</strong> she asked hesitantly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">The father   thought about this. He knew that giving his only child to a member of   a powerful clan as its mate is a huge thing as from what he learns about   the protectors and also another new-born protectors in this city that   is The Savage clan, Isabella would be the first in the history to be   claim as a human mate with one of theirs. As he thirsts for history,   he has been learning with awe of these families that have been keeping   this city from harm for 70 over years&hellip;during the time of his grandfather   and also during the time where these magical families moved to this   city with a duty to protect. Of course, as both families are equally   good yet different in so many ways, the battle between these two have   been going on for years till the time of peace came that happens 17   years ago where the love between a Savage male and a healer female fell   in love, and that was none other than Jacques Savage and Selena Falcon,   Elila&rsquo;s own parents. The first forbidden love between the two clans   and the first to love another outside their own clans as it was such   a law to find a partner in their very own clan, as for the blood must   always be pure. Even being a Savage, and their instincts and soul always   reveal to whom is their true mate, it has always been in from their   very own clan; if not in this city yet probably their cousins&rsquo; clans   from another city that have been descended directly from the original   Savage clan centuries ago as the number of clans becomes bigger and   bigger over the years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">But, William   Brooke always ponders why Elila Savage herself has a different mate   than the others? Such like her very own father Jacques Savage whose   true mate is Selena Falcon, different than him? What are God&rsquo;s plans   in this? Would Elila&rsquo;s descendants would be the ones that take different   mates in the future? Such a hard thing to answer something so complicated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Darling?&rdquo;</strong> asked the mother worriedly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">William jerked   slightly from his serious thoughts and realized that he hasn&rsquo;t answered   his wife&rsquo;s questions. His thoughts wonder again of her questions.   The important question is, whatever happens in the future would he accept   this? Finally, relaxing a little he opens his book again to continue   his reading.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Time   will tell dear&hellip;that it should be wise to wait and see.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
