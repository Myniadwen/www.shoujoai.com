The guy nods. &quot;Yup, that I am,&quot; he said with a smirk then turns back to 
his opponent

The man with white hair grits his teeth and walks towards the dojo. A 
shock goes through his brain as a message process to him mentally and he 
sighs.

&quot;Another day boy...&quot; the man said with a smile and vanishes

The guy standing in front of Asuka quickly turns around to the girls.

&quot;Hurry, we should bring her to the shrine&quot; he said

&quot;But-&quot; said Asuka till the guy brings up a hand to halt her

&quot;Your answers will be answered there,&quot; he replied &quot;Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll help 
carry your friend over there,&quot;

-2 days later-

Mion grimaces as she occupies a wooden chair next to the bed Sayuri was 
currently resting in for recovery.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry...&quot; she mutters &quot;Please.. Please wake up...&quot; Both of her 
hand clenches Sayuri&#39;s right hand tightly as a tear drops on Sayuri&#39;s 
hand.

*Twitch*

Sayuri slowly begins to open her eyes as she feels liquid falling on her 
hand.  Turning her head to her right and with her vision still a tad bit 
blurry, she notices a blonde staring back at her.

&quot;M..ion?&quot; Sayuri said hoarsely

&quot;Oh my god.. You&#39;re okay...&quot; she said barely higher than a whisper. 
Sighing with relief, she gently leans her forehead on her friend&#39;s 
shoulder while she still holds onto Sayuri&#145;s hand. &quot;You&#39;re awake...&quot;

Sayuri smiles weakly and strokes the back of Mion&#39;s head lightly. &quot;I&#39;m 
okay... hey... look at me,&quot;

Mion obeys and lifts her face up to her friend. Her heart beat quicken 
as she notices her face is only a mere inch from her friend. Mion 
blushes.

Not noticing her friend&#39;s actions, Sayuri uses her left hand and wipes 
Mion&#39;s tears away from her cheek. &quot;Don&#39;t cry.. I&#39;m fine now. Have u been 
here the whole time?&quot;

She nods, her cheeks growing more red by the second because of Sayuri&#145;s 
touch. &quot;The whole time.. For the past two days. That&#39;s how long you were 
out.&quot; she said nervously as Sayuri stares her straight in the eyes.

&quot;I see... you&#39;re okay right?&quot; she said and adds &quot; Oh- How about Asuka?&quot;

Mion shakes her head &quot;She&#39;s okay,&quot; she said &quot;Asuka just left a few 
seconds ago to get some apples to peel. I guess she thought you&#39;d wake 
up today... She was right then if she did.&quot;

&quot;I see.. So where are we then? I don&#39;t recognize this room,&quot; Sayuri 
turns her head and uses her eyes to glance around the room

Mion inhales as she finally breaks away from Sayuri&#39;s eye contact. 
&quot;We&#39;re at a shrine....&quot;

&quot;Shrine?&quot;

&quot;Ah, I see you&#39;re awake now,&quot; a male voice interrupted.

Mion quickly leans herself back into her seat. Sayuri faces to the door 
to see Asuka enter into the room with a guy around their age. Sayuri 
stares at the stranger and studies him. He had short brown hair with 
yellow highlights and was taller than Asuka by 5 inches.

&quot;This is..?&quot; Sayuri asks

&quot;My name is Ren,&quot; he said with a smile &quot;I see you&#39;ve protect our 
Priestess here so I really thank you. If it wasn&#39;t for you, I would&#39;ve 
been too late to rescue her. That&#39;d be really bad&quot;

&quot;Priestess?&quot; Sayuri murmurs, not understanding the situation.

&quot;When you were unconscious, Ren appeared right after. The man that 
attacked us, however, disappeared after a couple of seconds.&quot; Asuka said 
&quot;For the Priestess on the other hand... its going to a be story but..&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay, go on,&quot; Sayuri said sitting up straight

&quot;Are you okay though? You did break quite a few ribs,&quot; Asuka commented

&quot;Iie, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Sayuri said

&quot;Well first off then, we&#39;re at the shrine of Heaven. The one located in 
our town of course.&quot; she said &quot;And unexpectedly...&quot;

-Flash back-

The girls and Ren had just finish climbing the stairs. Ren walks to a 
black haired man dressed in a yukata and hands him Sayuri, who in return 
walks off into the shrine.

&quot;Wait!&quot; Mion cries out, and steps forward to run after her injured 
friend. Mion stops when she hears someone cry out a stop command. 
Confused, she turns to the side to see a miko walking towards them.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, your friend is in very good care. My husband is very good 
doctor, I trust he&#39;ll be able to help. Now, I know you both must been 
pretty riled up but please follow me into the shrine so that we may 
talk.&quot; With that said, the miko walks into the shrine leaving the girls 
no choice but to follow with Ren behind them.

&quot;Now do you know the of the legend that circulates around this town?&quot; 
the miko asks

The girls shake their head.

&quot;We know there&#39;s something to deal with a fight between heaven and hell 
but we&#39;re not sure more than that.&quot; Asuka said

The miko nods in return and faces a large statue with a dragon circling 
a phoenix. &quot;Well then I shall tell u so that it may help you guys 
understand the situation. You see, centuries ago in this town... Mankind 
tried to summon a great power to themselves so that they may separate 
themselves from being ruled by either Heaven and Hell. But.. They made a 
grave error. Unknowingly to humans, the ruler of the underworld knew 
mankind would want to possess power, so he had encaged deep within the 
Earth his strongest demon. He decided that in return, to give humans 
power, they will unleash the demon. So when mankind tried to summon the 
spell to grant themselves power they had bestowed upon Earth the most 
powerful demon from Hell, as well as being granted the power they had 
wanted. But because they have unlocked such a monster, the thing went 
and demolished everything on Earth. However, the bad events had not 
stopped there.. The power granted to humans had consumed them so much 
that they began to attack one another.&quot;

Ren sighs, &quot;Humans always want power..&quot; he comments.

The miko shot him a look to tell him to be quiet and continues, &quot;So as 
this happened, the ruler of the underworld sent his 7 demon masters on 
Earth to help start a new era. But of course, heaven opposed such 
catastrophe, so the ruler of heaven sent his 7 angel masters to Earth to 
help the humans. But alas, the most strongest demon was still too strong 
with the combination of the 7 other demons.&quot; She grows quiet.

&quot;Well? Then what happens?&quot; Asuka asks

&quot;That&#39;s the most troubling part to be honest. The legend tends to get 
fuzzy from there. All we know is that heaven in the end won by sealing 
the monster in some kind of ritual using two priestesses. One was a 
angel master and the other was a demon master. Of course, they were part 
of the groups fighting against one another. Afterwards, human kind 
returned back to normal. We&#39;re not exactly sure how they had beaten the 
monster or how they were sealed. What we do know is that the people had 
burned every text containing spells that could open the portal. They 
also engraved on the sealed demon&#39;s wall, how to defeat the monster in 
case it is unleashed.&quot;

&quot;Then.. You mentioned a second ago about two priestesses... I thought 
heaven and hell were against each other. Why would they be willing to 
help each other?&quot;

&quot;That part... is unknown as well I&#39;m afraid.&quot; the miko said

&quot;I see...&quot; Asuka said to herself then turns to the miko &quot;So what does 
this have to do with me?&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s because you&#39;re one out of the two to unlock and seal the 
demon. One of the Seven guardians of Heaven are Ren, my husband, and 
myself.&quot;

-End of Flashback-

&quot;So you&#39;re ... a priestess?&quot; Sayuri asks

Asuka nods, &quot;But my powers, unfortunately, isn&#39;t able to be unlocked 
until tomorrow. Inori, the miko here, is going to perform the ritual to 
do that tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;I see.. so then.. That means so far 4 of you are gathered. Are you 
going to look for the others?&quot; Sayuri asks

Asuka shrugs. &quot;Inori said that I would be able to sense the others but.. 
I don&#39;t sense anything. So we figured that they haven&#39;t awaked yet or 
either they&#39;re in some other country far away.&quot;

&quot;Eh? Awakened? So how are they suppose to wake up anyway?&quot;

&quot;Well... we all have a character mark on our forehead that says a 
certain characteristic. Unless we perform a strong act that is the 
characteristic on our foreheads, it won&#39;t awaken.&quot; Ren replied &quot;Though 
after the first time it appears, it&#39;ll appear on your upper chest. A 
little under the collar.&quot;

&quot;I see.. So what&#39;s everyone&#39;s mark?&quot; Sayuri asks

Ren points his thumb to himself. &quot;Well you see the angels and demons are 
categorized differently. We the angels have the 7 Heavenly Virtues. 
Meanwhile the other group have the 7 Deadly Sins. I am Justice, Inori is 
Charity, her husband Yuhi is Prudence, and Asuka is Hope. The ones we 
have left is Faith, Fortitude and Temperance. For the demons, there is 
Pride, Greed, Envy, Wrath, Lust, Gluttony and Sloth. Pretty interesting 
in my opinion?&quot; he said with a smile

&quot;I see...&quot; Sayuri mutters &quot;That&#39;s a lot to take in one day...&quot;

Mion nods. &quot;Well two days had passed so we&#39;re okay with it but since u 
just woke up its better that u rest for the time being if u want to let 
all this information soak in.&quot;

Sayuri shakes her head. &quot;No, I&#39;d really like to get out of bed. I feel 
so lazy laying in this bed... I think it&#39;s better if I start moving.&quot; 
Sayuri turns herself and swings her legs off the edge of the bed. Taking 
in a deep breath, she stands up onto her feet. &quot;How about you show me 
around the shrine?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Mion said and glances over at Asuka &quot;Want to come?&quot;

Asuka shakes her head, knowing her friend would want some peaceful time 
with Sayuri. &quot;I want to talk to Inori a bit more so I&#39;ll meet up with 
you guys later.&quot;

The two friends nod and leave the room.

Outside, Sayuri stumbles a bit and grits her teeth as pain shot up her 
back. Mion quickly ducks under Sayuri&#39;s arm and places it around her 
shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;ll help you walk,&quot; Mion said, her face growing hot &quot;They have a 
really large pond here. It&#39;s really beautiful at night.&quot;

&quot;Really? Can you take me there?&quot;

Inori watches the two girls as she stands at the walkway leading to the 
shrine. A hand gently places itself on her shoulder and she turns around 
to see her husband Yuhi smiling at her.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; he asks, &quot;You seem deep in thought.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m okay.. It&#39;s just... that girl Mion is with.&quot;

Yuhi stares at her in surprise and looks over at the girls who are 
marveling at the shrine&#145;s pond. &quot;Eh? What about her?&quot; he asks

&quot;For a normal girl... she healed quite quickly after receiving such a 
powerful blow,&quot; she said

&quot;Ah? That&#39;s true..&quot; Yuhi mutters &quot;Do you think she might be... one of 
us? After all, the guardians are the only ones who possess powers to 
heal faster than regular humans.&quot;</pre>
