<h1>Girl Talk</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fayeaz.html">Faye Aznable</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;So...you two have... never...?&quot; She frowned, running her fingers
through the long blue hair of the girl laying down next to her. They had
had the day alone together, for the most part. Or at least until the 
children got home from school, and their loved ones came back from the 
day out they very much needed. The two girls spent the day like any two 
girls would, having pillow fights, and talking, and the like. But now, 
they were laying down, their bodies tangled together, still tired from 
the last fight, and talking about things neither of their lovers would 
want the other girl knowing. 

&quot;I just get so scared, Rei, I don&#39;t understand it.&quot; Faye whimpered 
softly, frowning. &quot;I know he probably wants to more then anything, I 
feel terrible, I&#39;d like to too... But... Every time... I keep thinking 
about... Da-Da-Dante... It was so long ago, It&#39;s so foolish of me. 
but...&quot; She sighed, and stopped talking for a minute. She needed to 
control herself. She could feel herself trembling and she knew Rei 
could, too. 


Rei sighed, snuggling with the girl in her arms. &quot;We need to figure out 
a way for you to clear your mind, Faye... You&#39;re not supposed to be 
thinking about anything! Or if anything, we have to get you to think 
about Keith...&quot;

&quot;Oh. And how are we going to do that... Practice?&quot; She smirked. Even in 
the worst times, and the serious of conversations, she couldn&#39;t help 
but be bitchy, sarcastic Faye. 

&quot;Practice...?&quot; She thought for a second, and then looked down at Faye. 
She really was a beautiful person, She had all the right curves, that 
any girl would kill for, and that any man would love to be with. She 
could barely imagine how on earth Keith had the self control to not try
to be with her every night, but she could understand that he&#39;d just 
want her to be happy, without having to think of such terrible things. 
&quot;Practice... Now... That isn&#39;t such a terrible idea.&quot; She smirked, and
leaned down and kissed Faye deeply. She could feel Faye gasp and start 
to push her away, but Rei used one of her hands to hold down one of 
Faye&#39;s hands, and the other to start unbuttoning her shirt. 

Finally, Faye was able to over-power her, pushing her face away from 
hers. She used her free hand to now cover herself, since her whole 
chest was exposed. &quot;Rei... What are you doing?! We can&#39;t do this! We&#39;re
both girls! And...And you&#39;re married to my brother! And I have Keith! 
This is insane, Re-&quot; Her words were cut off by another kiss from the 
girl next to her, who slid her hand past her arms and started groping 
her chest softly. Faye closed her eyes, purring gently, not completely 
sure how to relax. &quot;Rei... You shouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Shhh... Just because we&#39;re both girls doesn&#39;t stop us from doing 
anything... And trust me, if Keith knows what I&#39;m doing for him right 
now, he&#39;ll thank me! Don&#39;t worry, Faye... I&#39;m just trying to make you 
feel better about yourself and about Keith and about all of this. Just 
let me help you, you trust me, right?&quot; She pushed Faye onto her back 
gently, kissing her again softly, and starting to pull off the rest of 
her clothes. One she pushed Faye&#39;s shirt, shorts, and underwear off the
side of the bed, she paused for a bit too look down at the beautiful 
body underneath her. Sure, it was scarred, but Faye was still one of 
the most beautiful people she&#39;s ever seen. She leaned down, kissing 
Faye on the lips softly, and then kissed her cheek, kissing down her 
neck down to her chest slowly. She kissed Faye up and down her collar 
bone slowly, making sure her lips brushed against the girl&#39;s skin so 
delicately that she shivered gently each time Rei kissed her. 

Faye trembled gently, and couldn&#39;t help but admit that she was getting 
turned on by such a treatment. There was still a thought in the back of
her mind that thought this was wrong, somehow, but it was in the very, 
very back of her mind, and all she could thinking about now were the 
lips grazing over her naked body slowly. She had her eyes closed, but 
she could picture vividly in her mind everything that Rei was doing to 
her. She purred gently when Rei&#39;s moist lips kissed her hard nipples 
softly, and then squirmed, gasping lightly as Rei blew on it slightly, 
making Faye shiver slightly. Rei was obviously trying to tease her and 
Faye was teased. The only response she could make to any of this was 
gasping gently, purring, and even moaning softly when Rei had managed 
the find the one way to flick her tongue that would hit one of Faye&#39;s 
most sensitive nerves. She pressed her legs together slightly, feeling 
the wetness in the area between her legs increase with each flick of 
Rei&#39;s tongue. 

Rei grinned, sucking gently and flicking her tongue even more 
rapidly, amused and turned on by Faye&#39;s gentle, surprised moans. She 
had one arm wrapped around Faye delicately, and the other, she had used
her hand to massage Faye&#39;s other breast roughly. She giggled to herself
slightly as Faye&#39;s moans increased upon this action, thinking to 
herself. Mnn. So you like it rough, don&#39;t you, Faye? She smiled, and 
started to nibble on Faye&#39;s nipple slightly, and gently pitch the 
other. She knew when Faye cried out that she had done something right, 
and continued to do so, and felt Faye&#39;s body squirm in pleasure 
underneath her. She shifted lightly, positioning herself so Faye&#39;s knee
was pressing in between her legs, so each time the girl below her 
squirmed, Rei could get her own little reward for it. She suckled 
Faye&#39;s nipple just a little harder, and then girl underneath her 
squirmed, Faye&#39;s soft skin rubbing against Rei&#39;s clitoris softly, 
making her give a slight purr of her own. But then, Rei shifted again 
slightly, crawling backwards slowly, and kissing down Faye&#39;s stomach. 
She could feel Faye start breathing heavily, getting slightly nervous 
and pushing her legs together slightly. She frowned gently, and kissed 
in the mouth southern region she could that Rei&#39;s bushed together legs 
weren&#39;t blocking off. &quot;Faye... Please... Don&#39;t worry about anything... 
This won&#39;t hurt a bit, please, don&#39;t be afraid.. Trust me, Faye...Trust
me, I&#39;m not going to hurt you in any way... This&#39;ll be the best feeling
of your life, I promise...&quot; 

She pushed Faye&#39;s legs apart gently, so gently that Faye&#39;s legs 
wouldn&#39;t have moved, if Faye didn&#39;t move them slightly on her own, and 
then she paused, to take a look at what was in front of her. She used 
two of her fingers to hold the &quot;lips&quot; in between Faye&#39;s legs. There was
a small patch of blue hair on top, and then inside the rest glistened 
slightly, from Faye&#39;s excitement. &quot;You really wanted this, didn&#39;t you?&quot;
She blew onto it gently, feeling Faye&#39;s body tremble and moan gently. 
Rei smiled gently, sliding one of her hands to the tight little hole 
in between Faye&#39;s legs, putting two of her fingers together and then 
sliding them inside of Faye slowly. She could feel the inner walls 
close around her fingers, and she started sliding back and forth. There
was a certain warmth, and of course, everything was very wet. She heard
Faye gasp loudly, and almost scream out, and she smiled, pleased with 
such a response. She leaned her head in slowly, starting to lick the 
small numb of skin on the very top of the slit in, and she heard Faye 
scream again, smiling, and continuing to flicker her tongue over it, 
just as she did with Faye&#39;s nipple, just gently, at first, the same 
with her fingers. She pushed them in and out at a slow pace, purring to
herself and intoxicated by Faye&#39;s scent. She started to move her tongue
faster, and pump her fingers out of Faye harder, going deeper into her 
each time.

The feeling was so intense. Faye gripped onto the covers on the bed so 
tightly, that her fingernails were almost ripping holes in it. She got 
louder with every movement of Rei&#39;s tongue and fingers, she screamed 
out in pleasure, squirming. There were times when the feeling got too 
intense and she wanted to shut her legs quickly, but she forced herself
not to, and each time Rei knew how she felt and went just a little 
gentler. But she felt this way a lot, considering that would only be
for a few moments when Rei would progress to her former speed, and even
a little bit above that. Faye&#39;s body started to stiffen up, and she
knew this wouldn&#39;t last much longer. She took deep breaths, it was
almost like she was gasping repeatedly, as she just froze, the feeling
of insane pleasure flowing out to the rest of her body, until she just 
screamed out loud, her whole body shaking as she finally orgasmed.

Rei grinned, sliding her fingers out of Faye slowly, and then lapping 
up all the juices she could. She lifted herself up slowly, crawling 
over to the side of Faye, and laying down next to her, giggling softly.
She wrapped an arm around Faye&#39;s waist, and lifted one arm up, gently 
massaging her breast softly, just because she could. &quot;Now wasn&#39;t that 
fun, Faye?&quot; She purred into Faye&#39;s ear, giggling. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to
do it with Keith?&quot; She just looked down at the panting girl next to 
her, understanding how worn out she was, and not exactly expecting a 
response. She snuggled against Faye softly, thinking about how much she
herself was turned on. She could most certainly take care of it 
herself, or wait for Alex to come home, but who she really wanted to 
was Faye. She kissed Faye&#39;s cheek softly, watching her chest rise and 
fall slowly, still having the taste of Faye in her mouth, and wondering
what it would feel like for Faye&#39;s tongue to be flicking over her own 
clitoris. She blushed, and turned herself on even more so, closing her 
eyes and laying back a bit, but then quickly opened her eyes again when
she felt Faye roll over on top of her.

Faye had finally caught her breath, and let the passion and desire take
over. She rolled on top of Faye and then kissed her deeply, tasting 
herself on Rei&#39;s lips, and purring gently. She reached behind her and 
started unzipping Rei&#39;s dress, and pulling it off of her quickly. She 
wanted Rei as badly as Rei wanted her, and this new raw passion was 
awoken inside of her now. She pulled Rei&#39;s panties off and undid her 
bra all at the same time, smirking. She undressed her completely and 
then smiled, looking down at Rei&#39;s naked body. She grinned, and then 
leaned down and kissed Rei passionately, purring gently and then 
reaching down and massaging Rei&#39;s breast softly, pinching her nipple 
and twisting it in between her fingers. She broke the kiss, smiling 
at Rei softly and then leaning her head down and kissing Rei&#39;s other 
nipple softly. 

Rei purred gently, closing her eyes and getting even more turned on. 
She loved every sloppy movement from the girl above her. She was so 
inexperienced, but the sloppiness, nervous quickness of it all was even
more erotic for her. She moaned gently, reaching her hand behind Faye&#39;s
head and running her fingers though her hair slowly. She smiled softly 
at Faye once she stopped and lifted her head up, and then kissed her 
softly. 

Faye smiled, and took Rei&#39;s hands in hers and pulled her up so she was 
sitting up, and grinned at her. She sat down in front of Rei and pushed
Rei&#39;s legs apart slowly, spreading her own legs. She shifted herself, 
raising one of Rei&#39;s legs so it was over her own, and then she propped 
up one of her legs on Rei&#39;s sliding closer to her, so the area between 
her leg&#39;s touched Rei&#39;s. She grinned, shivering a bit when she could 
feel Rei&#39;s skin brush against her own, and then smiled, pressing 
herself against Rei even more so, and shifting her hips up and down 
slowly, so she continued to grind against the purple-haired girl 
in front of her. She tilted her head back, moaning gently, and then 
wrapped her arms around Rei tightly. 

Rei gasped gently, barely understanding what was happening. This was 
new to her, Faye acting like that, and the new position she was now 
locked in. She wrapped her arms around Faye, and started to move her 
hips opposite of Faye&#39;s moments, trembling and moaning softly. The 
wetness from the two girls acted as a lubrication for such moments, 
but Rei still shifted herself so she was pushing harder against Faye, 
and Faye harder against her, moaning. She quickened her pace and Faye 
did as well, and the two girls moth tilted their heads back slightly, 
moaning. 

Faye pressed her whole body against Rei&#39;s, rubbing her nipples against 
Rei&#39;s and moaning even more so. She raised her head back up again, and 
then smiled at Rei, kissing her deeply, and sliding her tongue into her
mouth slowly, and almost wrestling with her tongue and moaned, though 
it was now muffled. And then, after a minute or two of the kiss, Faye 
broken it, and started kissing Rei&#39;s neck repeatedly, licking, kissing 
and suckling on her neck softly. She moaned into Rei&#39;s skin loudly as 
she kissed her, echoing Rei&#39;s own loud screams. The two girls moved 
themselves up and down against each other as hard as they could, and 
then they screamed out loudly, and Faye pressed her lips against Rei&#39;s 
as passionately and deeply as she could, and then the two girls 
orgasmed, together, at the same time, making each other all wet. 

Rei kept her hold onto the girl in her arms, and then collapsed, 
shifting her legs so she wasn&#39;t tangled with Faye anymore, and curled 
up slightly, panting heavily. She could feel Faye&#39;s chest raise up and 
down against her own and knew she was panting just as hard as she was. 
She kissed Faye deeply, and smiled, snuggling against her gently and 
grinning. &quot;Th...that was... in...insane... and amazing... Fa-Faye...
Yo...you were great...&quot; 

Faye giggled softly, purring into Rei&#39;s ear and whispering softly. &quot;And
so were you, Rei..&quot; She panted softly, and then smiled, nibbling on her
ear lobe softly. &quot;Though... I still think we&#39;re going to have to 
practice just a little bit more another day...&quot; She giggled softly and 
winked at Rei when she pulled her head back to look at her. Rei smirked
softly.

&quot;Oh, of course.. You&#39;re going to need a lot of practice... Every night, 
even!&quot;

&quot;Oooo!&quot; Faye giggled, and then kissed Rei passionately, and then 
finally, the two girls curled up together and fell asleep.

------

A week or so later.

Keith looked down at the girl underneath him. His fianc&eacute;e. He could 
barely believe this was happening, they&#39;d been together for a long time
now, but he never thought he&#39;d ever be able to do this with her. He 
never thought she&#39;d be comfortable enough with her.. But now she was, 
and he stared down at her body as he pumped herself in and out of her. 
He watched every movement of her body, the way her mouth twitched 
slightly as she moaned, and the way her breasts bounced up and down 
with each of her movements. He was almost hypnotized by the sight of 
the girl underneath him.

Faye kept her eyes closed, moaning loudly. &quot;Ooohh.. Reiiiiii~!!&quot;

&quot;... WHAT THE SHIT?!&quot;
