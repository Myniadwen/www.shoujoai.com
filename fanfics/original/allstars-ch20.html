Terra had a lot to do today, and she didn&#39;t need to be distracted by 
locker room mischief, so she delayed the shower and went straight home 
after practice. Lucky for her, Leena decided to cut their training 
early- but that only meant Terra would have to come back every day 
instead. This new arrangement would probably cut into her social life, 
as well as her Tae Kwon Do classes, but she would get plenty of friends 
and exercise playing soccer, so maybe it was for the best. After 
cleaning her body and mind in her shower, Terra took her time picking 
out a change of clothes, but she was interrupted when her cell phone 
went off. She was still in her bathrobe when she answered it.

&quot;Hello.&quot;

&quot;Um, Terra?&quot; Terra paused for a moment. That voice sounded incredibly 
familiar.

&quot;Speaking.&quot;

&quot;Uh...how have you been?&quot; It was on the edge of her mind...

&quot;Good,&quot; she answered cautiously. The girl on the other end laughed 
softly.

&quot;Just good? Come on, tell me what&#39;s happened. It&#39;s been awhile.&quot;

And then it hit her like a slap to the face.

&quot;...Mayu?&quot;

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;Get By with a Little Help from My Friends&quot;

 

&quot;It has been awhile,&quot; Terra said as her friends sat down together. 
Michael, Mayu, Nick, Tom, Dan... She thought she had lost them all when 
she transferred schools (well, not Nick: he also went to Carnegie, but 
their schedules kept them apart most of the time), but here they were, 
sitting down for lunch like nothing had changed. Terra was still 
uncomfortable around two of her closest friends- they had 
unintentionally embarrassed her one way or the other- but she tried to 
let bygones be bygones and cheer up for their sake.

&quot;Only a year by my count,&quot; Nick said. He cast an offended glance at 
Terra and rudely added, &quot;You know, some people should try and get in 
touch more often.&quot;

&quot;I was trying out for the soccer team! That took up almost all the time 
I had! Besides, I was making new friends to replace some of you goons.&quot;

&quot;Like who?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not naming names,&quot; she insisted sharply. He snorted and threw his 
hands in the air.

&quot;Probably Mike or Mayu!&quot;

&quot;No, I like them. Uh, not like that, you two.&quot;

&quot;No implications made,&quot; he said, smiling feebly. He had a girlfriend and 
Terra knew it- she had learned that the hard way. &quot;So just what kind of 
trouble have you been up to, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, did you ever get that comic finished?&quot; Tom asked.

&quot;Uh, one at a time, guys. First of all, I just got finished telling you 
I barely have any time on my hands.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got time to make new friends,&quot; Nick pouted.

&quot;Say Nicholas, are you on the men&#39;s soccer team? No, you&#39;re not. You&#39;re 
not on any electives, are you? I am on a team, and I do interact with 
other people.&quot;

&quot;It is the natural order of things,&quot; Dan admitted. &quot;She&#39;s just the kind 
of person who can make friends by bumping into a group like that.&quot;

&quot;A lot of bumping was done,&quot; she admitted skittishly. &quot;But seriously, 
I&#39;m glad to see you all, and I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve neglected you, Nick.&quot;

&quot;Bah, no big. We&#39;ve known each other for years; it&#39;s no wonder you&#39;re 
out looking for fresh meat. Anybody would get tired of me after awhile.&quot;

&quot;Well spoken,&quot; Michael noted.

&quot;So about the comic,&quot; Tom said. Terra sighed wistfully.

&quot;Again with the schedule. I was really hoping you&#39;d take care of some of 
it for me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got a lot of sketches and concept pieces if you&#39;d like,&quot; he said, 
reaching for his backpack. Terra glowed as she took a peek at them: the 
world they had envisioned together was slowly coming to life. She had 
been neglectful of it (and most of her other creative outlets) ever 
since the new semester began, but now she felt like she could squeeze it 
into her life again, if only for the weekends.

&quot;Sweet! Um, hold on a sec. Hi!&quot; Somebody Terra recognized was 
approaching their table.

&quot;Oh, hallo! Iz cute Terra come with many friends.&quot;

&quot;Guys, this is my teammate, Nadia Khovansky. She&#39;s from Russia! Isn&#39;t 
that cool?&quot; They waved at her, and Nick took a picture for his album. 
&quot;Nadia, this is Michael, Mayu my best friend, Nick- he goes to school 
with us- Tom, and Dan, my old high school friends. Can you believe they 
came all this way just to see me!&quot;

&quot;No, muzt be very good friends. Terra is lucky ducky.&quot;

&quot;She certainly is, to hang out at a place like this,&quot; Dan said. The fact 
that the Lily Club was infested with women, most of them lesbians, 
certainly didn&#39;t escape his eye.

&quot;Actually, I don&#39;t come here that often,&quot; she corrected. &quot;I mostly hang 
out at work. Oh yeah- I got me this killer job! It&#39;s like the best out 
there! I mean, I might transfer to Mirage after a few years...&quot;

&quot;Explanation, please!&quot; Michael exclaimed. Terra laughed and told them 
all about game night, Parody, Robin, Freya&#39;s offer, and how awesome her 
life was turning out.

&quot;It&#39;s about friggin&#39; time, too,&quot; Tom said, raising the glass Nadia gave 
him. &quot;After all the hell you were put through, it&#39;s good to hear you&#39;re 
finally doing so well.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t call my life perfect,&quot; she admitted pleasantly, &quot;but it is a 
helluva lot better. And who knows, I might start dating after awhile.&quot;

&quot;Someone from the team?&quot; Dan said quietly. Terra slapped him, making him 
choke on his drink. Mayu helped him cough it out and gave him some of 
her water. &quot;The hell was that for?&quot; he grumbled.

&quot;Are you suggesting I&#39;m a lesbian?!&quot;

&quot;I meant the boy&#39;s team! I thought you assumed that too!&quot;

&quot;We all know what happens when you assume,&quot; Tom muttered.

&quot;May as well tell him if you&#39;ve found love in your own locker room,&quot; 
Nick suggested. Terra glared but couldn&#39;t entirely deny it: her 
bisexuality was starting to blossom without mom or dad to disapprove. 
She was certainly curious, at any rate.

&quot;There isn&#39;t anybody I really like,&quot; she mumbled, picking at her food. 
&quot;Not like that. I mean, I found this martial artist I like, and I got a 
friend that likes video games and all, but nobody special.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s cool,&quot; Michael assured her. &quot;Dating people casually seems to 
suit you more. You shouldn&#39;t be in any rush. TRUST me.&quot;

&quot;Regrets?&quot; Terra giggled. &quot;You had your chance, Mikey.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot;

&quot;And you had yours,&quot; Nick said to Terra. She focused her wrath upon him 
and stepped on his foot.

&quot;Darn it, does everybody know about that?! Mayu, what did you tell 
them?!&quot; Mayu Takeya, who had been unusually quiet up to that point, 
suddenly flinched and tried not to look too guilty.

&quot;I-I didn&#39;t tell them anything, Thuy, I swear it! Word just gets around, 
you know.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like we&#39;re gonna alienate you for it,&quot; Tom muttered. &quot;I&#39;m in a 
same-sex relationship right now, and everybody&#39;s cool with it.&quot; They all 
agreed and nodded their heads, each one under the impression that at 
some point, a little curiosity is a healthy thing. Terra&#39;s Sapphic 
inquisitiveness was nothing to be ashamed of.

&quot;Holy crap, seriously? I thought you liked girls.&quot;

&quot;I also thought there were nine planets in the solar system.&quot;

&quot;There are,&quot; Michael insisted. &quot;Those astronomers don&#39;t know what 
they&#39;re doing.&quot;

&quot;Guys, subject change! It&#39;s okay if Thuy wants to date a girl, right? 
And it&#39;s perfectly all right if Mayu wants to try seducing her later 
tonight.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?!&quot; they both shrieked. Dan feigned guilt.

&quot;Whoops, they found me out! Scratch that plan.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to... Thuy, you seriously don&#39;t think that... Guys, it 
was just ONE KISS, okay?! God, why do you have to push things like 
that?!&quot;

&quot;Because it&#39;d be boring if we talked about politics and the weather,&quot; 
Nick muttered.

&quot;Or fashion trends,&quot; Tom added.

&quot;Or video games and anime all the time!&quot; Michael exclaimed. Everyone 
suddenly gave him a frigid stare, as if he had defiled their most 
treasured possession. &quot;Oh, come on, don&#39;t give me that look. We&#39;re not 
nerds. We all have real lives outside of that stuff.&quot;

&quot;Speak for yourself!&quot; Terra scoffed. &quot;When I graduate, I&#39;ve got a sweet 
graphics designing job lined up for me! I could actually introduce you 
to Freya if you wanted me too.&quot;

&quot;How about we meet all the team members?&quot; Dan suggested. &quot;Your friends 
are our friends, right?&quot;

&quot;I dunno about that, man,&quot; Nick muttered. &quot;I&#39;m not looking forward to 
seeing the people who are replacing us. Thuy probably has a boyfriend 
and a girlfriend lined up, too, and she&#39;s not telling us.&quot;

&quot;Conspiracy!&quot; Michael exclaimed, feigning shock. Terra laughed 
venomously.

&quot;Okay, everybody, seriously. New topic! I&#39;ve got a practice meeting 
tomorrow after school, so maybe I can show you around. There&#39;s this 
thing on Tuesday, but only Mayu can go since boys aren&#39;t allowed.&quot;

&quot;A clubhouse thing?&quot; She hesitated, thinking back to the...revealing 
episode from last week.

&quot;Something like that. But you&#39;re totally welcome to come to Parody on 
Wednesday night for video game tournaments.&quot;

&quot;Bah, we all have classes those days,&quot; Tom muttered- &quot;which probably 
means we&#39;ll have to skip.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d really do that for me?&quot; she squealed.

&quot;Duh! Of course we would!&quot;

&quot;You guys are the best friends ever!&quot; she exclaimed. Mayu sighed deeply.

&quot;Check please.&quot;

 

- Elisa Berkeley, British/Irish, 129 lbs (58.5 kg), left 
midfielder/reserve-

 

&quot;You&#39;re early!&quot; Gardenia exclaimed as she saw Felicity and Nadia coming 
in through the front door. They were both worn-out from practice, and 
you can bet that if this were any other job, they probably wouldn&#39;t have 
been able to come in.

&quot;The Coach let us out,&quot; Felicity explained as she headed to the employee 
break room. &quot;There&#39;s going to be a schedule change, so we&#39;ll have to get 
a new shift.&quot;

&quot;I was afraid something would have to give,&quot; she observed. &quot;I don&#39;t see 
how anybody could go to school, handle a job, and then practice for nine 
hours straight over the weekend...and waking up at 5 a.m. to do it, too! 
So what days do you need off?&quot;

&quot;Weekdays, if you could. We&#39;ll be meeting for a few hours every day, but 
our weekends are clear.&quot;

&quot;That should work out,&quot; Gardenia replied. &quot;Would you mind coming in 
before the noon rush and leaving sometime around nine? That&#39;s just ten 
hours a day.&quot;

&quot;Sounds fair, long as you can keep us occupied.&quot;

&quot;Now where do you think you work at?&quot; she grinned impishly. &quot;So how&#39;s 
practice going?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Felicity answered curtly before secluding herself in her job. 
Gardenia sighed impatiently and turned to Nadia. Felicity was slowly 
making progress, but...

&quot;Hey Nadia, how&#39;s practice going for you?&quot;

&quot;Only had two chances so far to play with people. Waz not good way to 
see how team iz going. We have all kinds of the skill to be seen 
playing, so must be hard job for Coach. Have seen many sexies with naked 
in shower!&quot;

&quot;Always a perk,&quot; she chuckled. A few customers came in to liven the 
place up, and among them were Terra&#39;s group, Robin, and Odessa. &quot;Hey 
there! It&#39;s not often I see you slacking off, Robs! Odessa must&#39;ve 
seduced you away.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing like that,&quot; she replied stuffily. &quot;We just happened to 
have the same destination.&quot;

&quot;Ah, that song again. So what brings you here? I know Dess won&#39;t have to 
clock in for awhile, but can you be away from your employees for so 
long?&quot;

&quot;The shoe&#39;s been put on the other foot,&quot; she joked, poking Gardenia in 
the arm. &quot;Fausta just got back from practice and took over. Terra&#39;s 
taking the day off, but she&#39;ll be fine on her own for awhile. I had to 
arrange their schedules because of those meetings.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, same here. What about you, Dess? You have to change any 
schedules?&quot;

&quot;No, not really. I only have one woman from the team working for me, and 
she was taking weekends anyway. So what&#39;s today&#39;s specialty?&quot;

&quot;Grilled ham and cheese in a crescent roll, with miso soup and truffles. 
It really hits the spot.&quot;

&quot;Are you on the menu?&quot; she grinned. Gardenia groaned to humor her.

&quot;Never heard that one before. So what about you, Robs?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll have the special, a mocha latte, and a Gardenia sundae,&quot; she said 
casually.

&quot;In that order?&quot; Nadia grinned; Felicity rolled her eyes.

&quot;Uh, yes, if it&#39;s not too much trouble. But seriously, do you think you 
and I could discuss something in private, Dee?&quot;

&quot;Sure, whenever you like. Um, this is a conversation and not something 
else, right?&quot;

&quot;What else could it be?&quot; she answered stoically. Odessa snickered.

&quot;Was your mind in the gutter, Gardenia?&quot;

&quot;Nah, only up Robin&#39;s skirt. ...Wow, that came out really wrong. Okay, a 
serious conversation, right? Just say the word and we can go to my 
office.&quot;

&quot;After lunch.&quot; She looked up at her best friend and smirked, deciding to 
relieve her tension. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;re not in trouble.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s a load off. So we all have someone from the team working 
for us, huh?&quot;

&quot;A coincidental connection?&quot; Odessa wondered. &quot;When is the first 
practice game? Kasumi&#39;s told me a little about it, and I&#39;m anxious to 
see it.&quot;

&quot;Ask the Odd Couple over there,&quot; Gardenia said, indicating Velur and 
Khovansky. Nadia was trying to get Felicity to warm up to her, and as 
always, she was having very little success. Odessa waved them over and 
presented her question.

&quot;Coach iz saying we might be having first game on last Saturday this 
month. Iz not giving us plenty of time for practice.&quot;

&quot;The team is looking a little amateurish,&quot; Felicity admitted. &quot;I don&#39;t 
want to suggest that any of us will be carrying the newcomers around, 
but- &quot;

&quot;All right, all right, I just wanted to know when it was,&quot; Odessa 
interrupted. &quot;So the last Saturday of this month, huh? One more for the 
ledger! Do you two know Kasumi Beckett?&quot;

&quot;Da, very sexy!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s actually my roommate.&quot;

&quot;A sexy roommate, huh?&quot;

&quot;Now whose mind is in the gutter?&quot; Gardenia grinned.

&quot;Whaaat? I just like the idea of two beautiful women living together, is 
all. So are you two a couple?&quot;

&quot;Who?!&quot; Felicity blurted, turning pale all of a sudden. &quot;You mean me and 
Kasumi or...us?&quot;

&quot;Kittiez not my girlfriend,&quot; Nadia giggled.

Unfortunately, they both thought.

&quot;I actually think to be dating someone else on team,&quot; Nadia admitted, 
her voice gentle and sincere. She was referring to Elisa; she didn&#39;t 
think of her as a girlfriend yet, but it was certainly possible...so 
long as her Nana approved.

Now there&#39;s a thought. Elisa and me, together? So warm and yummy! But 
I&#39;ve only been in one serious relationship. Would she stay with me if 
she found out what kind of life I&#39;ve led?

&quot;Oh, really? Who?&quot; Now that she was giving it some serious thought, 
Nadia blushed. Elisa was beautiful, charming, talented, sophisticated, 
gentle, considerate, sweet, compassionate...and yes, she suffered from a 
poor self-image, but Nadia struggled with this as well, and she fancied 
they could go through it together.

&quot;Eleeza,&quot; she whispered, grinning warmly.

&quot;Woo, sounds hot,&quot; Odessa sang, &quot;even though I don&#39;t know who that is.&quot;

&quot;So what about your people, Robs? Are they shacking up with anybody?&quot; 
Robin washed her meal down with the soup before answering.

&quot;You have a one-track mind, don&#39;t you Dee? But if you really must know, 
I have no idea. I think Terra&#39;s just trying to settle in, but Fausta 
might be dating. I&#39;m a little more concerned with my own business.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t your employees your friends?&quot;

&quot;I date them,&quot; she indicated. Everyone laughed except Felicity.

&quot;That&#39;s good enough! I&#39;ve met Fausta, but which one&#39;s Terra?&quot;

&quot;The cute Vietnamese girl with the anime shirt. You&#39;ve seen her!&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. She&#39;s got a great ass!&quot;

&quot;A one-track mind,&quot; Robin muttered. Gardenia pouted.

&quot;Well she does. And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve glanced at it too.&quot;

&quot;Sorry to burst your perverted bubble. Anyway, I&#39;m done here. If you&#39;d 
be so kind as to lead me to your office, milady.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Uh, after you, princess.&quot; Robin beamed and followed Gardenia, 
giving her a friendly shove along the way. Nadia blew out a sigh and 
looked at Odessa, who had tried to mind her own affairs.

&quot;They are like this every day?&quot;

&quot;Flirtatious, aren&#39;t they?&quot; she remarked. &quot;So, is your friend single?&quot;

&quot;Maybe. Kittiez never tellz me anything.&quot;

&quot;Then I guess there&#39;s no harm in asking her out!&quot; she concluded as she 
got up and headed towards the kitchen. Nadia smiled sadly as she watched 
Odessa make a pass at Felicity, and hoped that her friend would one day 
come out of her shell and open up to people.

Because if Felicity could, there was hope for Nadia yet.

 

Meanwhile...

 

&quot;A threesome with Odessa?! Robin, you&#39;ve got the dirtiest mind of us 
all!&quot;

&quot;I try,&quot; she beamed.

 

- Fausta Nazario, Italian, 139 lbs (63 kg), sweeper-

 

&quot;Pick up, babushka,&quot; Nadia hissed impatiently. &quot;I only get a 
fifteen-minute break. I don&#39;t want to waste it.&quot; Her grandmother finally 
answered the phone, although from the sound of things, she was 
rather...preoccupied.

&quot;Nadia! So good to hear from you again- and very unexpected!&quot;

&quot;Um...am I interrupting anything, Nana?&quot;

&quot;No, no, of course not, dear! Nothing&#39;s as important as my family!&quot; 
Nadia pursed her lips in irritation.

&quot;It&#39;s another &#39;friend&#39; of yours, isn&#39;t it?&quot; The older woman giggled 
perversely.

&quot;Is she too loud? I can gag her if you&#39;d like. She won&#39;t mind!&quot;

&quot;Ugh, didn&#39;t need to hear that,&quot; Nadia grumbled. Nana sounded slightly 
hurt.

&quot;Whaaaat? We&#39;re not doing anything wrong. I&#39;m still young and 
attractive, Nadia dear! It&#39;s not like I&#39;m a decrepit old mummy with a 
leather face and brittle bones! But I digress; what can your Nana do for 
you today?&quot;

&quot;Talk to me privately and stop being so perverted!&quot; Nana laughed and 
took her phone to the kitchen, where she locked the door and calmed down 
from her romping.

&quot;Mission accomplished!&quot; she gushed. &quot;But Inez will be most fussy when I 
return. I hope for your sake this is an emergency, Nadia!&quot;

&quot;TRUST me, babushka, I would NOT call you like this if it weren&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Oho, well then, I&#39;m all ears.&quot; Nadia took a shaky breath and let it out 
slowly.

&quot;I think I&#39;m in love again, Nana. I mean, I know I told you this before, 
but...I think I&#39;m ready to introduce you to somebody.&quot;

&quot;That was fast,&quot; she remarked. &quot;So what kind of person is she?&quot;

&quot;Oh, she&#39;s the best, Nana,&quot; Nadia sighed. &quot;She&#39;s so pretty and warm 
and...very wise. And she speaks Russian fluently.&quot;

&quot;Ah, she&#39;s got some advantages already! You know, I don&#39;t like it when I 
need an interpreter to talk to your girlfriends!&quot;

&quot;It was only one time, babushka, and my English has gotten better. Umm, 
doesn&#39;t this Inez woman speak English?&quot;

&quot;Spanish,&quot; she corrected. &quot;Now that I can manage. I was always good at 
acquainting myself with- &quot;

&quot;With a new tongue, I know, I&#39;ve only heard it a zillion times. So when 
would you like to meet her?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;This friend of mine!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you mean &#39;girlfriend&#39;? And what&#39;s her name?&quot;

&quot;Eleeza. Ugh! Eh...LEE...sa. There!&quot;

&quot;Ah, such a beautiful name! Well, if Inez can stop pawing at your Nana 
for a few minutes, I can come over and meet her sometime tomorrow 
evening. We can make a dinner-date out of it- my treat!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s very generous of you, Nana,&quot; Nadia said lovingly.

&quot;Well, it has been awhile since you&#39;ve had a girlfriend. So how many 
times have you seen her naked?&quot;

&quot;Good-bye, Nana,&quot; Nadia said, not in the mood to deal with her 
grandmother&#39;s mischief. &quot;I have to get back to work! I love you. I&#39;ll 
see you tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just for reference, Nadia! She doesn&#39;t have any blemishes or 
unsightly birth ma- &quot;

Click. Whew. Now the only problem left was explaining all this to Elisa. 
After all, she wasn&#39;t Nadia&#39;s girlfriend yet.

 

Elisa Berkeley was one of the lucky few that had the weekends off work. 
It wasn&#39;t that the library was closed; she just worked the other five 
days of the week and took the rest off. Somehow she managed to squeeze 
school and soccer practice into her schedule (it&#39;s amazing how much 
homework you can finish in a library), and even spared a little time for 
her friends. Tuesday and Wednesday were coming soon, each with different 
promises and possibilities, and she wondered if she would spend that 
time with Nadia again. She was a horrible dancer and a mediocre gamer at 
best, but being with Nadia made even the most embarrassing moments 
easier to bear. She seemed a little ditzy at first, but Elisa couldn&#39;t 
deny that there was a mature side to her new friend as well- a deep, 
profound feeling of loss, regret, wisdom, and joy achieved in spite of 
sorrow.

&quot;You silly fool,&quot; she berated herself, &quot;stop fantasizing already. Don&#39;t 
you have enough problems to worry about? You&#39;re bad enough at the game; 
don&#39;t think you can juggle a relationship. I mean, what would she see in 
me?&quot;

The phone rang. &quot;Hello, Berkeley and Threal&#39;s apartment, Berkeley 
speaking.&quot;

It was Nadia, dear Nadia. &quot;Hallo pretty Eleeza! You are not buzy at 
library job, yes?&quot;

&quot;N-no, I&#39;m just relaxing at home. I&#39;m still a little sore from practice 
today.&quot;

&quot;Come to Lily and I rub shoulders. Eleeza turn into soft, happy 
noodlez!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s very kind of you,&quot; she giggled.

&quot;I am being serious, you know,&quot; she said. &quot;I would like to see you. You 
can be here soon, da? Come here and we go on date! Tomorrow I show you 
my Nana, silly babushka wantz to see you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re introducing me to your family?&quot; she said carefully. Elisa could 
understand Russian; she didn&#39;t know why Nadia tried this hard for her.

&quot;Da, yes, she really wants to see you!&quot;

&quot;Um, all right, but whatever for?&quot; There came an uncomfortable silence 
where Nadia prepared herself. It had been a long time since she gave her 
heart to anyone, and something as significant and sacred as that cannot 
be treated lightly. She had to have the deepest sincerity and reverence 
for the moment. Nadia decided to reveal her feelings in Russian, the 
only way she could faithfully express them.

&quot;[She wants to meet you because she always wants to meet my 
girlfriends...and I want you to be my girlfriend.]&quot;

Now the silence turned to Elisa and waited for her reaction. The purity 
of Nadia&#39;s words came through, all right, and she was honestly 
flattered. To think that there was someone out there- someone who 
mattered- who felt that way towards her, and wanted to share a part of 
their life with her- HER! Elisa wasn&#39;t just quiet with awe, she was 
speechless. Nadia was the one who had to break the silence.

&quot;Are...you there? Eleeza?&quot;

&quot;I...I&#39;m here,&quot; she croaked, finally able to breathe again. &quot;I&#39;m just a 
little stunned, is all. I&#39;ve never really...I mean, I&#39;ve had boyfriends- 
here and there- and you&#39;re not the first girl I&#39;ve actually kissed, 
but...I mean, it&#39;s never come to that with me, and...um...am I rambling 
again?&quot;

&quot;A little,&quot; she laughed, &quot;but iz very cute. Nana will love you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, good, good, I hope so. I mean, I would never dream of intentionally 
offending her- I mean, I&#39;d do my very best not to offend her at 
all...um...are you sure I&#39;m not rambling?&quot;

&quot;Just say you will be here,&quot; she whispered warmly. Elisa took a deep, 
bracing breath.

&quot;What time?&quot;

&quot;Six please. Nana will treat us to supper tomorrow and give you...what 
is word? Iz big one. Ach, I forgot. She will see if you are okay for 
being my girlfriend. [An examination.]&quot;

&quot;An examination?&quot;

&quot;Da, that iz word! Iz very big.&quot;

&quot;Why would she...oh, wait, do you mean...um, to see if I&#39;d be a proper 
g...girlfriend for you?&quot; It was difficult to coax out, but once Elisa 
said it- girlfriend- she felt a little relieved.

&quot;Da, and do not worry, Nana doez this to all girlfriend I had. Iz, how 
you say, standard procedure? She asks question and looks at you for long 
time. Very sharp eyez on old babushka.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see. So...if I pass, I get to be your...your girlfriend, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and if you fail, sucks for you, okay?&quot;

&quot;Sounds fair, I suppose,&quot; she sighed. &quot;But don&#39;t get your hopes up, 
Nadia. I&#39;m nothing special.&quot;

&quot;You have good chance,&quot; she giggled. &quot;So we will meet today at six in 
Lily, and I give you pretty massage- &quot;

&quot;- that turns me into a noodle. Sounds like a plan!&quot;

&quot;Kisses,&quot; Nadia sang as she hung up. Her heart was hammering for a long 
time after.
