Daneira unbuckled the belt surrounding her waist, putting it and her 
sword down against the straw bed she would (hopefully) be sleeping on 
later. Her hands reached for the chest as she crouched down to open it, 
thankfully it was not locked. The half-cylinder lid opened with a just a 
fragile touch, and Daneira marvelled at the goods that had been 
entrusted to her. Inside the chest was an Iron Claw, a sort of rope with 
a metal three-pointed hook attached to it, a tool for climbing. There 
was also a bottle of Hilburn tonic, and a set of three maps. 

One of those maps was of the entire world of Asgarth, giving a brief 
overview of each of its three countries, the populated Wingard, the 
deserted wilderness of Naragard and the sparsely charted, monster filled 
land of Marrengard. The second map was of Wingard as a whole, and the 
third map of the surrounding area. Daneira was most grateful for those 
maps, so far she had been getting by only through word of mouth These 
maps would help her greatly, as Wingard was no easy land to travel 
across 

Wingard, the largest and most cherished country in Asgarth, was divided 
into six regions. One was Hilburn, the region that Daneira was presently 
in. The second was Branwen, the largest of all regions of Wingard. The 
third was Highdorn, an icy wasteland to the northeast. The forth was 
Maakenbrood, a vile swampy marshland to the far east. The fifth was 
Asmondell, which was south of Branwen and home to the largest city in 
the world, Mir Khan. The sixth and final region was Thanadoria, a 
tropical forest area, and home to the majority of Wingard&#146;s human 
populous. As soon as business was taken care of in this village, she 
planned to move on to Branwen 

But as Daneira looked deeper into the chest, she saw that there was 
something there that just did not seem normal. Or, more accurately, two 
things. One was an oval shaped gemstone; something that Daneira guessed 
was ancient crystallized dragon blood. The second was an unusually 
shaped piece of metal. It was a rod, with two spikes protruding out from 
its tip. It was inscribed with some very strange writing on it as well 
These words were;
 
&#147;Hyke mir nador kami li lo&#146;ther nol mor.&#148; 

Daneira had no idea what those words meant, but the language sounded 
ancient. It this were an ancient artefact then it would fetch a great 
deal of money from a travelling merchant. Still, it did beg the 
question, why would someone leave a precious thing like this to her? And 
what&#146;s more, Daneira couldn&#146;t get the strange feeling of... familiarity 
out of her head when she saw this item. How would she know about 
something like this when she had never seen it before in her life? 
Nothing seemed to be answerable now. The young dragon huntress took the 
items from the chest and placed them on her bed. Then, just as Daneira 
was about to spread herself over the bed, she heard a most chilling 
sound.

Her ears were alert and her eyes were wide as a screeching, piercing 
roar could be heard, ringing around the room like a bat&#146;s echo in a 
cave. In that very instant, Daneira stood up, grabbing her sword and 
rushing for the door. She knew that scream quite well. It was the scream 
of a teenage flame dragon on the prowl. 

Daneira strapped on her sword belt and ran down the stairs as fast as 
she could, the once joyous and haughty sound of male laughter was now 
silenced for the more appropriate sound of gasps amid silence. Daneira 
noticed them not and ran out of the inn, through the double revolving 
doors. Her feet touched the cobblestone road, and her head revolved 
around to see a sight she had not seen in the last two months. In the 
middle of the large road, shrieking and bellowing, thrashing its titanic 
head was the preying flame dragon, the very same one that had been 
attacking Hillwick. 

Daneira studied the flame dragon bit by bit. Its massive head was 
elongated and drawn out into the shape of a snout, on occasion releasing 
a gust of smoky air from its cavernous nostrils. Its long set of jagged 
teeth looked sharp and tearing, as piercing as any sword created by the 
greatest blacksmith. Its rigid skin was stern and oily, a very blunt 
red, giving it away for what it indeed was, a flame dragon. Its wings, 
though retracted, were mighty, Daneira mused upon the idea that it could 
reach as far as Highdorn in only a day&#146;s flight. Like most northern 
dragons, it had a powerful set of arms, three talon-like fingers, as 
polished as ivory, made up its rending claws, and its tail thrashed 
around the cobblestone ground, smashing into the abandoned hey carts and 
stalls of street. The townsmen had all disappeared into her homes, 
taking shelter from the beast. Though the odd scream from a frightened 
wife or infant could still be heard.

The flame dragon roared once more, its anger sending chills of fear and 
thrill down Daneira&#146;s spine. This was it. The time was right to finish 
off the dragon, making sure that it could never harm anyone again. The 
dragon huntress drew her sword, her eyes locked on the dragon. Its 
attention seemed to be focused on the corpse of a townsman it had just 
killed. With its long mouth, it snapped up its newly created meal and 
bellowed once more with satisfaction from tasting man-meat. 

&#147;I have to get it out of the village!&#148; Daneira yelled. 

The brunette ran around the side street of the inn, through the thin 
alley and toward the back of the building. She quickly observed 
something that could get her up to the roof of the building, a ladder, 
and then ran to retrieve it. Daneira sheathed her blade and held the 
long ladder with both hands, dragging it from its position on the floor 
to rest it against the back wall of the inn. Another of the dragon&#146;s 
shrieks could be heard, alongside the pounding sound of footsteps. 
Daneira realized that it was on the move, so swiftly began climbing the 
rungs of the ladder, inching higher and higher up the wooden tool. 
Eventually she reached the top of the roof, and climbed off the ladder, 
giving her a better view of the situation. The dragon was moving slowly 
down the street, each step it took left behind the large sound of 
thumping. Daneira un-sheathed her sword once more, and ran across the 
roof of the inn, jumping over the gaps between each house and building. 
Soon she was side by side with the hulking flame dragon once more.  

&#147;I have to wound it.&#148; Daneira mumbled to herself. &#147;I have to scare it 
away from the village. Then I am free to fight it in any way I choose.&#148;

A surge of adrenalin rushed through Daneira, as she stepped backwards, 
and readied herself The swordswoman than ran forward, screaming a 
terrifying war cry, and leapt off the edge of the roof. Daneira grabbed 
her sword by both hands and aimed it downwards, as she descended towards 
the head of the flame dragon. In one lethal swipe, Daneira slashed at 
the beast&#146;s head, slicing right along the skull, through the thin black 
eye and along the jaw. 

The dragon shrieked with fury and pain, as steel cut through its dark 
right eye, blinding it from one side. Blood splattered across Daneira&#146;s 
leather and metal armour, and she fell clumsily into a thrashed hey cart 
with a thump. 

The dragon clasped at the side of its sliced face and continued to 
scream, and in its outright anger, opened its wide jaws. Though 
Daneira&#146;s senses had been rattled by the fall, she could easily smell 
that fiendish stink of sulphur.  And she knew what that meant. Daneira 
gasped, and jumped out of the cart as best she could, diving into one of 
the streets that offshoot from the main one. A second later, a huge gust 
of searing hot fire blew out from the flame dragon&#146;s mouth, straight 
down the street for at least thirty meters ahead. The fire set the 
neighbouring hey carts alight, and burned the butcher shop at the end of 
the road. A huge fire rose up from the remains, the surrounding shops 
then caught fire and in a short few seconds, the inferno began to 
spread. The consumers inside the shops ran out as fast as they could, 
screaming and shouting, their flesh singed by the raw heat of the dragon 
fire. The dragon itself opened its massive wings, the lizard-flesh 
extending with ease. It began flapping its wings, creating a huge gust, 
which blew embers and fire across the village, into other streets. 
Daneira&#146;s ponytail blew back in the wind, the force of the dragon&#146;s 
wings were so powerful that she could barely move forward. 

After giving another cry, the dragon flew upwards, launching itself into 
the now warm air. It screamed once more as it hovered over the town, 
then flew away to the northwest Daneira watched it escape with regretful 
eyes. The beast had gotten away. But there was something more urgent 
that needed to be taken care of and that was the fire that was rising in 
Hillwick. Daneira didn&#146;t even think to sheath her sword, as she ran out 
of the alley and back into the main road, which was now littered with 
fire. The brunette dashed along the road; keeping her mouth closed to 
protect her throat from the smoke, staying as close to the buildings as 
she possibly could. She reached the inn, and stormed in, to see that 
most of the men had remained as they were, hiding inside. 

&#147;Quick!&#148; Daneira yelled. &#147;The village is on fire! You have to get to the 
village well and put out the fire as quickly as you can!&#148;

The men nodded in agreement, and all erupted out the inn doors to get to 
the well. Daneira did not follow them, she instead ran up the stairs, 
towards her bedroom, and kicked open the door with authority. She 
scrambled to the bed, and grabbed the Iron Claw that had been given to 
her as a gift by the townsfolk. It would definitely be useful In her 
haste, Daneira did not notice that the town bells were ringing, probably 
as a sign of emergency. She just ran out the door and down the stairs 
again, sheathing her sword and tying the Iron Claw around her waist. 
Daneira left the inn, and circled around to the stable, to Harmony. The 
poor horse had been shocked by the events, and was now bucking and 
wailing inside the stable, probably from the heat. When it saw Daneira, 
Harmony calmed down, but was still restless. Daneira kicked open the 
ramshackle gate of the stable, and undid the knot that was tying 
Harmony&#146;s reins to the wall. In seconds it was free, and Daneira quickly 
mounted her steed, riding out of the stable and back into the main 
street. While the townsfolk did their best to put out the fire, Daneira 
rode out of the village, toward the northeast. It was the direction that 
dragon had left in. She and the dragon had some unfinished business to 
attend to.

**********

Nephalie sighed at that at monotonous sound of horse hooves clicking 
against the ground and cartwheels rolling along to the beat. The journey 
from the east seaport was longer than she had expected it to be. And at 
the current speed that the cart was moving, it seemed like she would 
never reach the town of Thyne. The state of Branwen was not far from 
their first stop, Hillwick village, but it was going to be very 
difficult to reach Branwen from their current position. Not that she was 
in any hurry to reach the destination. But she did not have any desire 
to travel in such rough conditions With such company. Nephalie looked 
over at the female guard who had been accompanying her inside this horse 
drawn cart. She was a typical guard, armed with a long spear and a short 
dagger at her waist, wearing Branwen style armour. Though she was not 
looking, Nephalie could feel the guard eying her up and down, observing 
her smooth long legs and innocent body, rationing her lust on simple 
glimpses of Nephalie&#146;s oblivious seductiveness. 

Those lusty stares made Nephalie uncomfortable, but her demeanour did 
not show this. By now she had become accustomed to such stares, and 
furthermore, she was not ignorant of her own beauty. The mysterious 
Nephalie was defined as angelic at the least, long braided blonde hair 
framing her face so sweetly, a curvy and desirable body to match it, and 
innocence that children would have trouble emulating. But what made 
Nephalie so alluring was the peculiarity of her. There was a spiritual 
air of gentleness and latent power surrounding her. But the strangeness 
was not merely spiritual. Physically she was... different to other 
women. Her eyes were tinted with a very rare eye colour, gold, and her 
ears were pointed, in the same way that you expect to see an elf&#146;s ears. 
But unlike an elf, she was clearly mortal There was something about 
Nephalie that made her special... different. 

The guard suddenly spoke. &#147;I trust you feel comfortable.&#148;

&#147;I... I feel fine.&#148; Nephalie replied. 

&#147;Good.&#148; The guard grinned. &#147;I would not want Celesbe to think that I&#146;m 
not taking adequate care of you. You have to be one of the most sought 
after women under her influence. I cannot believe that she went to so 
much effort to seize you... but from the looks of you... I can 
understand her lust.&#148;

Nephalie said nothing. The guard didn&#146;t take that in a negative way, and 
smiled as a new idea came to her mind. Without saying anything, the 
female guard placed her spear to one side, moving over to Nephalie, who 
was sitting in the corner of the indoor carriage. The guard moved up to 
the young girl, tossing her eyes over that wondrous body once more. 

&#147;You are so beautiful...&#148; She crooned. 

Nephalie looked out the window of the cart as the guard moved against 
her. In seconds she could feel the female guard&#146;s lips gently kissing 
the tender flesh of her neck. But Nephalie said nothing against it, just 
looking out with blank, almost soulless eyes. 

After a moment, she spoke. &#147;I am not your property.&#148;

&#147;I know that...&#148; The guard said, drawing back. &#147;You belong to Celesbe 
You are just another puppet for the Slave Guild. But even slaves can 
keep secrets And even slaves need to enjoy the many pleasures of the 
flesh&#133;&#148;

The guard was just about to lean into Nephalie&#146;s neck once more, until 
she heard the distinct sound of a roar. Both Nephalie and the guard 
looked up in alertness, as the roar was repeated, this time much louder, 
as if something was closing in on the carriage. The carriage came to 
stop, the horse in front began screaming with frustration, and the guard 
realized that there might be a problem. The female guard grabbed her 
spear, and then opened the door to the outside.

&#147;Stay in here.&#148; She said sternly to Nephalie. The young slave girl just 
nodded. The guard stepped out of the carriage to inspect the problem. It 
was not long before Nephalie heard a scream. It was not that of the 
guard, but rather that of the driver, but in seconds, the guard&#146;s death 
cry could be heard along the winds. Nephalie stuck her head out of the 
carriage&#146;s open window to see what might be happening, and gasped in 
alarm as she saw the killer, in all its glory. 

A huge flame dragon, loomed over the road, the driver&#146;s corpse beneath 
its right foot, and the guard&#146;s torso between it powerful lined jaws. It 
had been blinded on one side of its face, darkening blood seeped out of 
its closed eye, but that did nothing to quell its appetite. Nephalie 
looked on in horror as the flame dragon gobbled up the guard in one 
swift motion. It then looked downwards at the driver, who was murmuring 
and groaning to herself. In a second fast motion, the dragon tore the 
upper body of the driver in half, munching down on the much sought after 
delicacy of dragons, human meat. While the dragon devoured its meal, 
Nephalie scrambled out of the carriage and ran for her life. Though she 
was breaking orders by running away, it was apparent that she didn&#146;t 
have much choice. The dragon looked up from what was left of the 
driver&#146;s bloody remains, and watched Nephalie run in the opposite 
direction. 

It released one of those powerful roars once more, separating its wide 
jaws, and let loose a burning ball of dragon fire in her direction. 
Nephalie looked back as she ran, seeing that she was about to be burned 
alive by that ball of flames. But just when the end seemed at hand, a 
flash of an image dove into her, and that flash was a person. The two 
tumbled out of the line of fire, into the thick bushes in the forest 
surrounding the roadside. Nephalie&#146;s body rolled into the dirt, a 
slightly larger body cradling her own. With the dragon&#146;s roars in the 
background, Nephalie looked up at the person whom had saved her. It was 
woman, a taller woman, maybe a few years older than she was. The taller 
woman shook her head a bit, obviously to shake off the effects of the 
dive, then looked down at Nephalie with concerned eyes.

&#147;Are you unharmed?&#148; The black-haired heroine asked. 

Nephalie nodded, unable to say anything. The brunette smiled, then 
looked back into the main road as the dragon bellowed another scream. 
She quickly dismounted her position on Nephalie, and then helped the 
slightly shorter girl up to her feet. 

&#147;Listen.&#148; Started the brunette. &#147;If that dragon kills me, run through 
the forest toward the southeast. There&#146;s a village nearby called 
Hillwick It is in a bit of a state but you&#146;ll be safer there. Do you 
understand me?&#148;

Nephalie just nodded, still unable to speak. The brunette patted 
Nephalie on the shoulder, then drew her sword and ran out into the main 
road. Nephalie did not follow, but moved to the edge of the concealing 
bushes and trees to watch what would become of this courageous woman. 
She smiled arrogantly, as the flame dragon loomed across, a slight gap 
separating them from each other. 

&#147;So!&#148; The girl said to the dragon, her head looking up. &#147;You thought 
you&#146;d slaughter another innocent girl to enhance your already numerous 
tally, eh? I can guess that you did not assume you&#146;d run in to me when 
you tried this!&#148;

Nephalie blinked. Was that woman insane? How could she just stand there 
like that when a huge dragon was about to feast upon her too? All she 
had to defend herself was a sword. What could that one girl do? Nephalie 
was about to get her answer. The dragon roared with fury, its scream 
echoing across the surrounding forestland. The black-haired woman 
charged at the beast, both hands wrapped around the hilt of her sword, 
dashing across the dirt path with no fear or uncertainty. The dragon 
opened its wide jaws once more and spewed a fresh batch of its burning 
hot breath. The brunette dove to the left with all her body, rolling out 
of the stream of the fire. She rolled back up onto her feet, and charged 
at the dragon once more. In retaliation, the dragon hurled another blast 
of flames in her direction. Like before, the swordswoman dove to the 
side, but this time the right, tumbling across the dusty road etched 
into the forest. 

The dragon screamed with frustration, and blew another stream of 
singeing fire at the woman She did not dive to any side this time, she 
rolled forward, her sword arm extended during the roll. Neither Nephalie 
nor the dragon had realized that she had been baiting it into a better 
position. Now the girl was directly below the dragon, to close to hit 
with fire and too far down to attack with it claws. The brunette yelled 
a fierce war cry, gripped her sword tightly, and then thrust the blade 
into the skin, muscle and bone of the dragon&#146;s right leg. 

The mammoth creature cried out as sharp steel tore through the matter of 
its leg and ripped back out, slightly hindering its ability to walk. The 
dragon continued to howl like a dying banshee, while the brunette ran 
through the gap of its legs. But she did not count on the furious 
thrashing of the tail, and gasped as the long body part knocked her off 
her feet. The girl collapsed to the ground, dropping her sword from the 
sudden shock. The dragon ambled its body around, realizing that the girl 
had ran between its own legs, and then roared menacingly at the downed 
fighter. His mouth snapped open like before, a typhoon of flames 
shooting out of its mouth The girl seemed to act on nothing but 
instinct, as she tumbled out of the way, rolling as fast as she seemed 
to be able to do. The girl looked up and turned her gaze to the newly 
erected fire. It cut her off from her sword, which made her defenceless 

Nephalie began to worry that the girl who saved her was in trouble, and 
thought about running out there to help her. But she knew full well that 
she would do more harm than good. Nephalie remained as she was, poised 
on the ground in the bushes, watching this all happen before her 
frightened eyes. 

The girl battling the dragon darted her eyes back and forth between the 
sword, blocked by fire, and the dragon, who was slowly moving closer to 
her. She seemed to have no time to think, so simply acted, and ran back 
towards the carriage that Nephalie had been travelling in, just a bit 
further up the road. The dragon followed as best it could, its leg 
wounded from the woman&#146;s previous assault. The girl stopped as she 
reached the carriage and the two dead bodies lying next to it. In her 
haste, she quickly grabbed the spear that the guard had been carrying, 
taking it up in one swoop. The girl looked back and saw the dragon 
towering over her, and then flipped forward to avoid the surge of fire 
that was about to come. The dragon acted in such a way, breathing more 
of its vile flame breath, razing the poor carriage with venomous fury. 
It went up in flames, destroying anything and everything that was inside 
it. But the girl still showed no fear, and drew back the arm holding the 
spear. With a might thrust, she flung the spear at the dragon, which 
pierced the somewhat fragile tissue of its right wing. 

Nephalie could tell that spears were not the girl&#146;s strong point, as the 
throw was awkwardly aimed, but it did its job. The dragon screamed 
another fearsome scream as the spear was embedded in its wing, taking 
its focus off the girl it was pursuing The brunette took the 
opportunity, and ran hard back to her blade, now that the dragon was not 
in the way. She didn&#146;t stop running, just swiftly ran by, leaned down, 
grabbed the sword and ran back around, without stopping. Her feet slid 
against the dusty ground, and for a small instant, she had to get her 
breath back. The distance between herself and the dragon began to 
decline again as it turned around to chase the girl, still relentless in 
its desire for her blood. The girl stood defiantly, gasping for breath, 
then threw caution to the wind and charged the fiend for a second time. 
The dragon screeched again, perhaps out of irritation from this girl&#146;s 
obstinate attitude and breathed more burning fire. The brunette ran 
around the path of the flames, and then ran back into position, still 
charging at the dragon. She stopped as she reached that position between 
its legs again, and then attacked the leg she had previously stabbed. 
This blow was much fiercer than the last, and it cut through the thick 
leg with ruthless aggression The woman rolled to the right to escape the 
incoming fall, as the dragon found it could no longer balance its weight 
on the injured leg. It crashed into the ground, whipping up a gust of 
dirty dust and screaming a black howl of what some might call, 
realization of defeat.

The girl ran around the downed body of the dragon and screamed once 
more, heaving her sword into the air. She aimed the tip of her blade 
downwards, toward the neck of the beast, and poised herself to strike. 

&#147;Feel the agony of those you&#146;ve destroyed!&#148;

The magnificent steel blade was thrust downwards, till it pieced the 
rough hide of the dragon&#146;s neck, stabbing through its trachea. The 
dragon gurgled a bloody roar, choking on its own blood. The girl ripped 
her blade free of the dragon&#146;s neck as its writhing body fell limp. She 
backed up, dropped the sword, and collapsed to the ground, her energy 
spent. Nephalie&#146;s golden eyes looked at this in worry, and ran out of 
the bushes to help the tired warrior. She ran as fast as she could, and 
then crouched down to inspect the girl&#146;s condition. 

Nephalie held a hand to her head, and slotted her arm under the 
brunette&#146;s neck, pulling the other girl upwards from the waist. She was 
awake, but severely tired

&#147;Are you hurt?&#148; Nephalie asked caringly.

The brunette shook her head slowly. &#147;...No, but you should not worry 
about me.&#148;

&#147;But you just saved my life&#133;&#148;

The brunette coughed. &#147;I... couldn&#146;t save the other two though... 
because of my carelessness... I should not have assumed that the dragon 
would retreat to its lair...&#148;

Truth be told, Nephalie didn&#146;t really know what to make of that, so just 
avoided the issue by introducing herself.  &#147;My name is Nephalie M&#146;dale&#148;

&#147;...Daneira Midland.&#148; Daneira replied tiredly. &#147;Nice to make your 
acquaintance, miss M&#146;dale.&#148;

And so, on that day, the dragon huntress, Daneira Midland, met the slave 
girl, Nephalie M&#146;dale. Though it seemed like their meeting was by 
chance, it was fate that had brought them together.
