<a href="../original/angelgift-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>        Allison stumbled down the hallway towards the bedroom she 
shared with Jenna, all the while rubbing at her eyes and feeling 
oddly grateful that the evening was finally coming to an end. Not 
that she minded having Amara and all of the others here, but it did 
get just a bit tiring. She pushed open the bedroom door, stepped 
inside, then froze.

        The room was dark, the only light coming from a few carefully 
placed candles. From the shadows Jenna appeared, her long black hair 
flowing gracefully down her back. Her body, all of it so generously 
proportioned, was barely covered by a nearly transparent garment that 
very probably should have been illegal.

        &quot;You...&quot; Allison&#39;s face was oddly pale, her short brown hair 
having suddenly developed a cowlick, &quot;I.. I mean, you..&quot;

        Jenna frowned cutely, &quot;You&#39;re not ready for bed yet.&quot; With a 
determined expression Jenna advanced on the mildly stunned Allison.

        Allison&#39;s eyes widened as they accidentally fixed on the 
bouncing breasts approaching her. She tried to step back, her feet 
tangling up as she fell backwards with a cry. &quot;Owee,&quot; she whimpered, 
rubbing at the back of her head.

        Jenna knelt down, the scent of her perfume wafting over the 
dazed girl. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked softly, reaching out to 
stroke Allison&#39;s hair back to check if she was injured.

        &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Allison managed, a blush coloring her 
cheeks.

        Jenna knelt there, gazing into Allison&#39;s eyes, amusement and 
some deeper emotion visible in them. &quot;Your shyness is so charming,&quot; 
she murmured softly, &quot;back home, there are those who would be taking 
full advantage of me right now.&quot;

        Allison blushed fiercely, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t!&quot; She hesitated a few 
moments before finally saying softly, &quot;I like you, Jenna.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Jenna answered her softly. She took a breath, &quot;If 
you truly don&#39;t want to be engaged to me, I won&#39;t hold you to it any 
longer. I had hoped, but...&quot;

        Allison looked at her, feeling an odd moment of loss. For 
weeks she had been telling herself she had to get out of this 
situation, and now that she was being offered a way out she 
hesitated. She looked searchingly into Jenna&#39;s eyes, feeling the 
caring and warmth in them.

        &quot;I like you,&quot; Allison repeated hesitantly. She smiled, 
reaching out to cup the beautiful dark haired woman&#39;s face, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know if I love you, but.. give me a bit of time.&quot;

        Jenna sat there a moment, then tears glistened on her cheeks. 
Not saying a word she threw her arms around the startled Allison, 
sending both of them thumping back to the floor. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she 
laughed, pressing her lips to the startled young woman&#39;s.

        Allison lay there in stunned shock for a moment, then she 
found her arms wrapping around the other woman, returning the kiss 
tentatively. They drew back, and Allison smiled goofily as she softly 
murmured, &quot;Wow.&quot;

        Jenna chuckled softly, rising to her feet and gently pulling 
Allison up beside her. She slid her arm into Allison&#39;s, &quot;Let&#39;s go to 
bed.&quot;

        Allison gulped, &quot;Right.&quot;

        Milly looked up from where she was curled up in one of the 
living room chairs, keeping an eye on where the soundly sleeping 
Amara lay on the couch. Sharin smiled slightly, her blonde hair 
flowing around her face, fully dressed unlike the night gown clad 
Milly.

        &quot;Where are you going?&quot; the catgirl asked. Milly looked up at 
her anxiously, worried that the tall warrior might be leaving them, 
returning to the Empire maybe.

        &quot;Just taking off for a few hours,&quot; Sharin answered. She felt 
an odd moment of surprise that the redhead cared, then stopped 
herself firmly. &#39;She&#39;s Jenna&#39;s bodyguard, too,&#39; she reminded 
herself, &#39;Milly&#39;s probably just concerned about that.&#39;

        &quot;Too bad,&quot; Milly sniffed, trying to reestablish her reserve 
around the other woman. She frowned, her curiosity getting the better 
of her, &quot;Where are you going?&quot;

        &quot;Going out looking for a fight,&quot; Sharin admitted.

        &quot;You Questers,&quot; Milly smiled, &quot;always seeking the action.&quot;

        Surprisingly Sharin grinned back, &quot;This coming from the 
catgirl who has to open up every container in the kitchen whenever 
she goes in there.&quot;

        Milly flicked her cat&#39;s ears back then forward, &quot;Someone 
might have put something interesting in them while I was gone.&quot;

        Sharin laughed, reaching out to ruffle the red hair 
gently, &quot;See you later.&quot;

        Milly&#39;s cheeks went red as she purred a moment, then tried to 
bast at the retreating hand. Recovering her composure she 
managed, &quot;Be careful.&quot;

        Sharin smiled back, &quot;Always do.&quot; She visibly summoned up her 
power, and then disappeared into the night.

        Milly watched her go, her eyes dark. &#39;What in the world is 
coming over me?&#39; she wondered, watching the tall blonde shrink into 
the dark skies.

        Walked on the sidewalk Kat looked up in surprise. Changing 
the subject she asked her companion, &quot;Is that Sharin?&quot;

        &quot;It looks like it,&quot; Roma agreed, the disguised android 
narrowing her eyes slightly. She looked over at Kat, refusing to give 
up the topic, &quot;Love?&quot;

        &quot;Love,&quot; Kat sighed, her long brown hair flowing in a rough 
braid. She looked over at the woman beside her, the short red-gold 
hair falling into golden eyes, and asked, &quot;So what do you want to 
know about it?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I understand the concept,&quot; Roma admitted, 
feeling that odd sensation again under Kat&#39;s gaze. &quot;I did some 
research at the shop, but it didn&#39;t seem to clarify things very 
much,&quot; she noted with a frown.

        &quot;Which books were you reading?&quot; Kat asked curiously.

        &quot;I was looking through the erotica section,&quot; Roma answered 
her matter of factly.

        Kat blinked. &quot;Those sort of books might give you the wrong 
idea about human love,&quot; she said, trying her best not to laugh.

        &quot;Oh, good,&quot; Roma smiled, &quot;it all seemed rather.. messy.&quot;

        That made Kat chuckle softly, &quot;It can be messy in real life, 
too.&quot;

        Roma hesitated, &quot;Have you ever been in love?&quot;

        &quot;Once or twice,&quot; Kat admitted. She looked up at the night 
shy, &quot;I went into this little shop, made my way to the back, and then 
she looked up at me and smiled... pow! That was it.&quot;

        &quot;What happened?&quot; Roma asked, wondering who this mystery woman 
was. She felt a odd irritation, an emotion she thought she recognized 
as jealousy.

        Kat was silent, &quot;I eventually figured out Allison was 
straight.&quot; She smiled ruefully, &quot;Or now that Jenna&#39;s come along, that 
I&#39;m not her type.&quot;

        Roma blinked at her in surprise before softly murmuring, &quot;It 
seems that everyone has fallen for Allison.&quot;

        &quot;Is that why you were asking about Love,&quot; Kat looked over at 
her curiously, &quot;have you fallen for the irresistible Allison&#39;s charm?&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Roma shook her head slightly, &quot;but I&#39;ve begun to 
feel... oddly, around someone else.&quot;
