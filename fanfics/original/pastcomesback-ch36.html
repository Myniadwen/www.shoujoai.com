<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch35.html">Back to Part 35</a><pre>      &quot;That arm of hers,&quot; Faye growled out. &quot;So annoying!&quot;

      Erin would agree if she wasn&#39;t so busy trying to find a way to attack Tsuki. Faye had 
been trying with her ribbons, but Tsuki counteracted each time by shredding them with a 
combination of light and dark energy. Erin&#39;s golem was taking seal after seal after seal and 
it was starting to wear her down.

      &quot;Can&#39;t your... power of love or something break through her attacks?&quot;

      &quot;It should, it&#39;s just not working well since her magic attacks are out of this world.&quot; 
As if on cue, Erin&#39;s golem had to intercept another blast for them. Tsuki only smiled, seal 
and markings all around her. The symbols on her arm were aglow, allowing her to activate 
almost a limitless amount of attacks.

      &quot;She&#39;s trying to wear us out...&quot; Faye murmured before looking over at Erin.

      &quot;Can you cover me?&quot; The snake goddess asked. &quot;I have a plan, but I wish I had thought 
of it sooner...&quot;

      Erin sent her golem into the ground and Faye used her ribbons to erect a barrier in 
front of them. &quot;She may be able to block all our attacks, but if they&#39;re coming from 
different directions...&quot; The green haired woman sighed and began to concentrate.

      Faye, even though curious about what her lover had planned, focus on keeping them out 
of harms way. Her barrier should be alright... It was then that the red head watched a golem 
snake pop out of the ground, trying to take a bit at Tsuki. It was half the size of Erin&#39;s 
regular golem... and the another snake of the same size came out from behind the brunette.

      Tsuki easily destroyed them, but the snakes only split in half and returned to the 
ground. They jumped out again, four of them, smaller, from different directions. Tsuki took 
them out, but suddenly realized the predicament she was in as the snakes split.

      &quot;Of course,&quot; Faye murmured. &quot;Tsuki can&#39;t make a barrier to protect herself from 
attacks beneath her, so...&quot; She turned to Erin. &quot;You are such a sly girl!&quot;

      &quot;Please, Faye, I need to focus. This is really harder than it looks,&quot; the other girl 
said, crouched on the ground, eyes still shut.

      By now, Tsuki&#39;s attacks stopped because she was too focused on the golems - now the 
size of the Posh-Posh - all leaping at her. One sunk its fangs into her ankle and she 
tripped. Tsuki quickly tried to summon up an attack, but Faye bound her arms with her 
ribbons and pulled. Tsuki started to scream as energy racked her frame and Erin let out a 
deep breath, tired.

      All of her golems formed back into one large snake, curling around the now passed out 
girl.

      Carmilla and Bakra weren&#39;t having an easy time either. The demon ground his teeth as a 
knife nicked his shoulder. It was too hard to get close to her and she was too fast. If they 
tried to grab her spirit threads to pull her off balance, she would merely make them 
dissipate. Carmilla&#39;s shadow beasts were only really good shields and even if the vampire 
tried to surprise her, she dodged away instantly.

      &quot;Eveon&#39;s waiting by the gate, right?&quot; Carmilla suddenly asked him.

      &quot;Uh, yeah... why?&quot;

      &quot;Well, I think I&#39;m going to need her blood to heal me after this attack,&quot; she 
murmured, her usual playful demeanor gone. Without further ado, she climbed atop a shadow 
beast and charged at the little girl.

      &quot;Wait a second!&quot; Bakra cried out, but he could only run behind her. She was going to 
be killed in a manner of seconds if she charged in blindly.

      He watched as Hina mercilessly threw her weapons and Carmilla&#39;s beast disappeared from 
the stress of the attacks. The vampire landed on her feet, trying to land a blow, but Hina 
dodged and stabbed her.

      That was when Bakra understood Carmilla&#39;s real purpose. It was hard to defeat the 
sisters one-on-one because they were skilled with that kind of combat. However... if 
something spontaneous were to happen, it was another story. Carmilla desperately bit down on 
Hina&#39;s arm and the blonde girl, obviously frightened, started stabbing the vampire to make 
her let go.

      Before she could bury her knife into Carmilla&#39;s back a third time, Bakra grabbed Hina 
in a headlock. Really, if Faye hadn&#39;t told him he wasn&#39;t allowed to kill the girls, he would 
have sliced and diced her. Hina began to struggle, but he didn&#39;t relieve any of the 
pressure. Carmilla let go and fell to the ground from her injuries while Bakra let out a 
groan. Hina had just buried her knife in his thigh. Just peachy.

      When she finally went limp, he carefully released her. Faye and Erin came over with an 
unconscious Tsuki in tow. Bakra sat down on the ground, looking at the knife. &quot;Remind me why 
we don&#39;t kill these girls?&quot;

      &quot;Because they&#39;re brainwashed,&quot; Faye said, checking to see if Hina was really 
unconscious. Erin helped Carmilla up.

      &quot;Are you alright?&quot; she asked and the vampire groaned.

      &quot;No, but I just need to feed to get better,&quot; Carmilla replied.

      Erin giggled. &quot;I see... so this was all just to get to eat Eveon?&quot;

      &quot;No!&quot; The vampire yelled before letting out a slight scream. &quot;Ah! My back... my 
back...&quot;

      It was then that Josh and Sakura arrived. &quot;Oh boy,&quot; the young man said, kneeling down 
next to Bakra. &quot;I&#39;m glad you all seem to be okay, but... what a mess.&quot;

      Sakura crouched down as well. &quot;Something doesn&#39;t... something doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot;

      Faye nodded. &quot;Yeah, you can tell too? Something&#39;s not right with these girls.&quot;

      Josh went over to Tsuki and undid Faye&#39;s ribbons. When he started removing the girl&#39;s 
robes, he could feel curious stares on his back. &quot;Hey - we&#39;ve already established that I 
like guys - I&#39;m doing this for the sake of these poor girls.&quot;

      He turned her over on her back and let his hand glow with holy energy. &quot;Like I thought 
- a spell that binds them to the Demon Lord. If they succumb to this, then they have to obey 
him.&quot;

      Faye let out a sigh. &quot;No wonder. Hoshi must have been making them succumb to the 
spell...&quot;

      Josh placed his hand on Tsuki&#39;s back and let his holy energy pour through her. As the 
curse broke, she let out a scream before passing out.

      &quot;That... that sounds painful,&quot; Erin murmured.

      Josh shrugged. &quot;Eh, they&#39;re already unconscious.&quot;

      &quot;But she still screamed,&quot; Sakura pointed out as the young man went over to Hina and 
repeated the process. She screamed as well.

      &quot;Whatever, they should be fine now, but they will remember everything from when they 
were under the spell. They&#39;ll be pretty disillusioned when they wake up.&quot;

      Sakura looked over at Bakra. &quot;Here, let me heal you,&quot; she said and the demon nodded.

      &quot;Oh, thanks. I really- GAH!&quot; The angel mercilessly pulled out the knife before setting 
to work.

      Erin helped Carmilla up and said, &quot;I think I&#39;m going to take her back since she needs 
blood. Plus... I think I spent a lot of my energy fighting Tsuki. I don&#39;t think I will be 
much help from here on out...&quot;

      Faye looked disappointed, but she knew Erin was right. Bakra stood up, putting some 
weight on his healed leg. &quot;I&#39;m still okay, so I can go on.&quot;

      Sakura looked between all of them. &quot;So... that leaves the four of us?&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;...does she have to?&quot;

      &quot;Mina, she injured herself in order to win, so I think she deserves it,&quot; Erin said 
softly, trying to coax Mina out of her anger.

      &quot;Yeah, but she left a hickey the last time!&quot;

      Eveon sighed and turned to Carmilla. &quot;You so owe me for this...&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re such a sweet girl and-&quot; Carmilla winced. It hurt to talk. The bloody vampire 
leaned forward and bit into Eveon. The blonde girl grimaced upon first contact, but 
eventually closed her eyes and let it be. Carmilla needed it to heal, so she didn&#39;t mind so 
much.

      &quot;Just turn around and don&#39;t look then,&quot; Erin said, forcing Mina to sit a little 
further away.

      Abby was trying not to laugh, but turned her attention back to Tycara, asleep in 
Seth&#39;s lap. &quot;You know, in a few more days, I&#39;m sure you guys can be normal again.&quot;

      The young man grinned. &quot;I know. It&#39;s pretty exciting.&quot;

      &quot;Yep, now me and Sakura don&#39;t have to spy on you anymore to make sure you aren&#39;t 
molesting our daughter.&quot;

      &quot;You... you spy on me?&quot; An awkward silence followed, but Seth broke it. &quot;Those girls 
look a lot more harmless asleep, don&#39;t they?&quot;

      Abby looked down at the two girls, Tsuki and Hina, unconscious on the ground. &quot;Yeah, 
and apparently they won&#39;t be psycho killers anymore, so that&#39;s always nice. Although sisters 
that screw around with each other...&quot;

      The mother started to laugh quietly to herself. &quot;Abby,&quot; Seth said in a scolding tone. 
&quot;They&#39;re probably going to be traumatized when they wake up so try to hold back on the 
jokes.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ll try, but pretty sisters doing each other? Just imagine how weird their puberty 
talks must have been.&quot;  

***** 

      Hoshi was about to sheathe her sword, until a voice interrupted her. &quot;You are right 
about one thing.&quot;

      Krystal confidently stood up and said, &quot;We both use holy power so it&#39;s hard to harm 
one another.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re still awake? I thought I knocked you out,&quot; the silver haired woman mused, 
pointing her sword at Krystal. &quot;Aren&#39;t you tired?&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m really good at channeling holy energy,&quot; she said, getting in a fighting stance. 
&quot;Even if it&#39;s not my own.&quot;

      Her makeshift weapon and her body began to glow with holy power as Hoshi figured out 
what happened. Krystal provoked her in order to absorb her attack. &quot;You are a sly, sly 
girl,&quot; Hoshi murmured, a bit unnerved.

      &quot;You gave me a bit of a recharge, so thanks. But you&#39;re the one who is going to lose 
today.&quot; Krystal began to charge up her wooden weapon. &quot;Since you use dark energy, I can 
still hurt you.&quot;

      With that, Krystal dashed forward, but Hoshi easily blocked her. &quot;Even so - if you 
can&#39;t hit me, it doesn&#39;t make a difference!&quot; The blonde barely avoided a slash.

      Krystal said nothing and tried to attack again. Hoshi blocked with her sword before 
swinging her sheathe at the blonde. It caught her in the side, but Krystal only grinned. &quot;If 
we&#39;re this close, I don&#39;t think I could miss.&quot;

      It was then that Hoshi noticed the build-up of power in her opponent. &quot;Flare Art: Holy 
Fire!&quot; A conglomeration of white flames formed around them, but Hoshi didn&#39;t have enough 
time to get away. Krystal backed off and watched as the fire dispersed.

      Hoshi was trying to stand up, using her sword as a crutch. &quot;No... I&#39;m not going to 
lose... I have to...&quot; She got up and charged at Krystal. The blonde easily side stepped her. 
&quot;I have to protect them... Who&#39;s going to protect them?&quot;

      Hoshi whirled around, but Krystal struck her blade so hard that it flew off to the 
side. &quot;It&#39;s over, Hoshi.&quot;

      &quot;No, it&#39;s not! I have to... I have to... I love them so much...!&quot; The woman faltered 
and Krystal caught her as she fell. &quot;Who&#39;s... going to guide them...? Keep them safe...?&quot;

      Hoshi continued to babble and as she cried on Krystal&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I need to... do it 
for them. They need me...&quot;

      Krystal fell to her knees, holding the older woman close. It was... very sad, in a 
way, to see someone so destroyed by their own good intentions. She ran a hand through her 
silver hair with a sigh. &quot;I&#39;m the only one,&quot; Hoshi sobbed out. &quot;I have to...!&quot;

      &quot;You don&#39;t have to do anything, anymore.&quot; Krystal reached into the collar of Hoshi&#39;s 
robes and places her hand on her back. It was pulsing with dark energy.

      Hoshi started to struggle. &quot;No, no, no! You can&#39;t-&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;ll be free, so don&#39;t worry.&quot;

      &quot;No, then I will have to...&quot; She stared at Krystal, her gold hazel eyes dancing with 
worry. &quot;I will have to think.&quot;

      Krystal gave her a small smile. &quot;It will be alright. I promise.&quot; With that, she poured 
holy energy into the curse and Hoshi screamed. After what seemed like eternity, the spell 
broke and the woman passed out.

      Krystal let out a sigh and cradled her close to her chest. After a while, she decided 
it was time to leave. She needed to get herself and Hoshi out of here as soon as possible.

      &quot;I figured you would win.&quot; Krystal looked up to the door opposite of the one she 
needed to escape to. &quot;I was a little worried that Hoshi would beat you, but I guess I 
worried for nothing,&quot; Tsuru said, walking over to her.

      Krystal shot to her feet and picked up Hoshi&#39;s sword. This was just great - as soon as 
she beat one enemy another appeared. She still had energy left, so she could at least 
stall...

      Tsuru held up her hands. &quot;I&#39;m not here to fight you, Krystal, I just want to talk to 
you.&quot;

      &quot;If it&#39;s about being your Bride, then you can forget about it. I won&#39;t hesitate to 
attack you.&quot;

      Tsuru shook her head and continued approaching her. &quot;I know that. But now I need your 
help with releasing the souls.&quot;

      Krystal swallowed uncomfortably. &quot;I&#39;m not going to help you.&quot;

      Tsuru stared at her for a moment with her dual colored eyes. &quot;I think I can change 
your mind.&quot;
