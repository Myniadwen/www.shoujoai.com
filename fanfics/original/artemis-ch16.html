<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 16 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/artemis-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Circe groaned softly, the blonde beauty rolling over
on the bed only to roll right off the edge and hit the
floor with a soft thump. &quot;Owee,&quot; she winced, rubbing
her butt and looking around her sleepily.

&quot;You always do that,&quot; Diana looked amused, the tawny
haired lady peering down at her lover with amusement
from the other side of the bed.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be morning without it,&quot; Circe admitted
goodnaturedly, getting up in just her nightie and
stretching out sleepily.

Diana watched her with admiring eyes as her voice
dropped to a purr, &quot;I suppose you couldn&#39;t just come
back to bed?&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Circe smirked then wiggled her bottom
seductively.

&quot;Don&#39;t tease,&quot; Diana blushed.

Circe turned around, sauntering back to the bed as her
eyes darkened with excitement. &quot;I suppose we could get
up later,&quot; she purred, climbing back onto the bed and
sliding up to rest at Athena&#39;s side.

&quot;Athena can always open up for us today,&quot; Diana
murmured as they kissed, bodies sliding together
warmly.

A few moments later a nightie flew away from the bed
to land on the lamp nearby, soon followed by all of
Diana&#39;s nightwear.

Meanwhile Athena was just finishing off her morning
jog, the tall blonde haired warrior coming to a stop
outside the apartments with a fluid, almost feline
grace. She used her kep and went inside, nodding
greetings to people she knew as she walked to the
stairs, then with a deep breath she proceeded to run
up them.

&quot;You are disgustingly healthy, you know that?&quot; Madoka
complained, the black haired Asian woman yawning
tiredly.

&quot;You should join me one morning,&quot; Athena smiled back
cheerfully, &quot;a ten mile jog is very invigorating.&quot;

Madoka shuddered visibly. &quot;Hell no,&quot; she said. Her
eyes brightened a bit, &quot;Are Diana and Circe supposed
to be working?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Why?&quot; Athena asked as she headed towards her
suite.

&quot;They aren&#39;t up, and I heard...&quot; Madoka smirked.

Athena chuckled, &quot;Guess I&#39;m opening today.&quot;

&quot;Would you like a hand?&quot; Madoka offered to help, her
expression just a bit more than the usual degree of
friendly.

&quot;Oh, I should be fine,&quot; Athena unlocked her door as
she added, &quot;excuse me, but I need to go get changed.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Madoka said with a disapointed sigh as Athena
disappeared from sigh. &quot;Damn that girl is fine,&quot; she
muttered under her breath as she headed back to her
own suite, &quot;too bad she&#39;s such a cold fish.&quot;

Athena had to fight back a smile as she disrobed and
hurried to the suite&#39;s shower. &#39;Wonder what she&#39;d
think if she knew I could hear that?&#39; the goddess
thought with a laugh as she stripped off her undies
and climbed inside.

A brutal blast of icy cold water brought out a cry of
surprise from Athena, but she stood the cold blast for
a few more moments before gradually turning the heat
back up. Lathering up her body she scrubbed all the
sweat away, then grabbed the shampoo bottle and washed
her hair. Humming softly and satisfied she was clean
Athena left the shower, toweling herself off with her
favorite fuzzy one.

With a spring in her step Athena headed back
downstairs, leaving the old apartment building behind
the Daughters and heading to the club itself. For such
a center of power the place looked remarkably normal,
a converted building that housed one of the most
unusual clubs in the whole city.

Athena unlocked the front doors, feeling faintly glad
that the place&#39;s defenses were now keyed to her, too.
If she had been considered a hostile force by the
mystical barriers that protected the whole group of
buildings she would have been blasted into a greasy
smear on the sidewalk. The overhead lights came on
with a flick of a switch and she looked around,
figuring what she would have to do first.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Descent nodded not long after as the raven
haired demoness walked in, her leather one piece
garment hugging her body like a second skin.

&quot;You&#39;re really going for that whole sexy bartender
vibe, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Athena asked, looking amused.

&quot;Think I should tone it down?&quot; Descent actually smiled
slightly.

&quot;Hey, whatever gets you tips,&quot; Athena shrugged.

&quot;Don&#39;t encourage her,&quot; Sam growled, the priest&#39;s
sleeves rolled up as she helped with cleaning the
tables and putting out chairs.

&quot;I understand you have some fans, too,&quot; Athena pointed
out as she and Descent wiggled the kegs of beer in
place.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Descent looked amused.

Sam actually blushed a bit. &quot;The lady just likes
uniforms,&quot; she said in her defense, &quot;I saw her going
after a off duty cop, too.&quot;

&quot;If you say so,&quot; Athena smiled sweetly, fighting back
her amusement at how bashful the priest looked..

Descent hooked up the keg and tested it, then they got
the second one in place. For a demonic warrior with a
mission to destroy evil she was a pretty good
bartender, and was gradually becoming a friend to the
bar&#39;s owners, too.

&quot;So where are Circe and Diana?&quot; Sam asked curiously,
reaching up to wipe the sweat from her brow.

&quot;They&#39;re,&quot; Athena&#39;s eyes twinkled impishly as she
paused dramatically then said, &quot;sleeping in, so to
speak.&quot;

Descent chuckled warmly, &quot;Good for them.&quot;

Sam chuckled softly, &quot;I noticed that Circe was getting
a bit irritable, maybe this will get her in a better
mood.&quot;

&quot;Heh, knowing Diana she should be in a much better
mood,&quot; Athena grinned.

&quot;Who would be in a better mood?&quot; Circe asked as she
and Diana come in through the front door, freshly
showered and with a happy glow around them both.

&quot;I&#39;m hoping Jess Drake might be in a better mood,&quot; Sam
improvised fast, &quot;I heard that she and Alice were
together again.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hope, even without the drinking she&#39;s been a
bear lately,&quot; Diana said as she walked over to check
over the bar.

&quot;Thanks for opening up for us,&quot; Circe actually blushed
a bit, &quot;I don&#39;t know why we slept in like that.&quot;

&quot;Everyone needs to sleep in now and then,&quot; Athena said
with a nod, not letting on that she knew what they had
been doing this morning.

&quot;Right,&quot; Diana gave her a slightly suspicious look.

&quot;So,&quot; Descent changed the subject smoothly, &quot;is that
changeling singer coming in again? Her Tori Amos
impression was incredible.&quot;

&quot;I was, wasn&#39;t it? Selene&#39;s doing some part time work
at Purgatori, but she promised to be in again,&quot; Circe
said.

&quot;Purgatori....&quot; Sam frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t like what I&#39;m
hearing about that place.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Diana admitted, &quot;but there&#39;s not much we
can actually fo about it.&quot;

&quot;Anyone who actually calls herself Me&#39;erlyn is
obviously a poser,&quot; Circe said with a firm nod of her
head.

&quot;Hope you&#39;re right,&quot; Descent said.

&quot;All right, time to open,&quot; Diana said briskly.</pre>
