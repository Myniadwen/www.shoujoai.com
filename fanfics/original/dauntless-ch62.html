<p>“Voyage to Venus: knockin’ on heaven’s door”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The Acherons, upon learning of their next destination:</p>
<p>“<em>Venus</em>? Are you cracked? That place is a  living Hell! It’s even worse than the Necropolis if you can believe  it.”</p>
<p>“The surface is hotter than Mercury, the atmosphere  is clogged with fatal gas— not to mention we’d be crushed  instantly once we flew in— there’s no life, no water, and no way  we’ll set near it, let alone land!”</p>
<p>“Whatever business you think you have on there will  just have to wait until people have advanced enough to colonize it.  You couldn’t pay us enough to go there.”</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, nobody’s ever landed on  Venus, have they? I mean, even Mercury’s been explored by people.  You’d think that with the proper equipment, we <em>could</em> technically go there…”</p>
<p>“Regardless, <em>I’m</em> not going there. What’s  so important about this wasteland, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Your arguments are very sound,” Amy replied  patiently. “But whether or not you want to go, we are going.”</p>
<p>“It’s suicide,” Kayleigh hissed, breaking away  from her demure personality. “We’d have a better chance of flying  back through that asteroid field in Lennethium drive.”</p>
<p>“But we <em>are</em> going.”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you been listening to us?! We don’t have  the technology with us to survive on that world! If you really need  to go, ask Kyrie to make you a suit— and leave the rest of us out  of it!”</p>
<p>“I won’t need a suit. I’m to go naked. And we are  going there, even if I have to go on my own.”</p>
<p>“Are you even <em>listening</em> to yourself? There’s  a fine line between being brave and being stupid, and you’ve  crossed over it, sister! If you land there without any clothes on,  you’ll burn to a cinder if you don’t get squashed or die of  monoxide poisoning first! Damn right you’re going on your own!”</p>
<p>“No, you’re not going at all! None of us are!”  The sisters took the controls and jerked them until the <em>Dauntless</em> veered away from the Morning Star back to Earth’s moon. Amy grabbed  their wrists firmly, and stared at them with fiery determination. She  apparently knew what she was getting into, but even so…</p>
<p>“Please turn back. I have to go there. I’m not  asking you to come with me; I just need you to land. I’ll give you  the proper coordinates and everything: you just need to touch down.  And please, have some faith in me. That’s all I’m asking.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to get all of us killed for nothing,  you know,” they grumbled.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you care about the crew so much,” she  grinned, “but we’ll be all right. <em>I’ll </em>be all right.  It’s not the first time I’ve been there.”</p>
<p>“So you keep saying, but there’s no proof.” Amy  put the knuckle of her index finger in her mouth and bit down on it,  like she had a secret and didn’t want to reveal it. She had proof  right there with her, but she knew that nobody would believe it.  Eventually, however, the Acheron sisters finally gave into her  nagging demands, if only because they believed in her. After all,  Miracle was one of the few people who treated them like individuals,  not a two-headed monster.</p>
<p>“Oh, all right, let’s see those coordinates.  Really, now: this is the stupidest thing we’ve ever done. You sure  you don’t at least want a spacesuit? That can protect you for a few  hours at least.”</p>
<p>“No thank you. I appreciate this, you know.” She  gave them an endearing smile and limped away, presumably to undress  and go along with her insane plans. Teleah watched her go with a  forlorn sigh, while Kayleigh numbly guided the <em>Dauntless</em> back  to Venus. In a matter of moments, they would pierce her thick  atmosphere and be on the deadly surface, saying goodbye to their  friend, leader, and benefactor as she walked right into the Inferno.  It was by far the worst thing they had ever done.</p>
<p>“Wait!” they cried as they thrust everything into  automatic. “We’re coming with you!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Kyrie Lastgear made a face when she heard the news, and  surprised a few people when she stated that Venus was not “her kind  of place”. Everyone just assumed she liked all of that  fire-and-brimstone; Kyrie laughed and corrected their error. Venus  had no life and no raw materials for construction, so why should she  be interested in it? It made as much sense as saying she liked the  desert simply because it was hot. When faced with the problem of  making a spacesuit to combat the deadly Venusian elements, Kyrie  showed several prototypes, two of which proved very effective against  toxic fumes, heavy pressure, and intense heat. When asked when she  had made them, Kyrie simply said, “Awhile back. It’s just that  nobody <em>noticed</em>. Can’t I have secret projects now and again?</p>
<p>“So Amy’s really determined to go there, is she?  Well, it’s official! There are people in the crew crazier than I  am! She’d be better off swan-diving into an active volcano! And you  say she’s going naked? Ha! She certainly has strange tastes! It’s  always the one you least suspect, right?”</p>
<p>“And I was so close to admiring her for her guts,”  Lil muttered. “Just when you think you can like someone, they do  something totally idiotic like this!”</p>
<p>“Come on, everyone,” Rachel said, hovering above  them lazily. “She must have a reason for doing this. Look, I know  better than most that my master’s not all there, but she’s not  stupid.”</p>
<p>“That’s it!” Kyrie exclaimed, banging her head  against something as she jumped. She yanked her horns out and said,  “She’s going to use you to shield herself down there! Of course!  Why didn’t I think of that before? But why go there naked? Damn,  that’s the stumper.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going,” Rachel stated. “Master ordered  me to stay behind. Besides, I think I’m forbidden to go.”</p>
<p>“Scratch that idea,” Lil sighed. “Well, I’m  certainly not following her to find out— but I am curious. Maybe  until we get to the docking ramp. Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I suppose it’s as good a time as any to test these  suits,” Kyrie gestured. Meanwhile, in another part of the ship,  Rebecca and Riene were reuniting when they heard the news. They had  barely been given enough time to hug— admittedly, a new and  refreshing action for them— when Mink came in with the  announcement. The fact that the stone-faced Yun looked visibly  concerned was enough to stir them away from their happy meeting.</p>
<p>“Is she really serious? I mean, Amy’s really going  along with it?”</p>
<p>“She’s heading for the docking ramp as we speak—  probably undressing, too.”</p>
<p>“This doesn’t make any sense,” Riene hissed as  she clutched her head. “Nobody’s ever set foot on Venus for a  reason. And to go naked… Just what is she thinking?!”</p>
<p>“Is anybody else going with her?” Rebecca asked.  Mink nodded.</p>
<p>“The Acheron sisters decided to come with her, and I  hear Kyrie, Valti, and Lillianne are going as well. Rachel with stay  behind, but I think I’ll go, too. Something tells me that I  should.”</p>
<p>“Do you have a death wish?!” Riene exclaimed.</p>
<p>“No, she’s right,” Rebecca murmured as she sat  up. Her wings fluttered with alien strength as she walked down the  hallway, following Mink with a stunned Riene in tow. “I can’t  explain it, but something tells me we need to go there— we need to  follow her. I know it’s going to be risky, but it’s like I can’t  resist. I don’t want to. It’s something deep inside, like my soul  is talking to me, or I’m being called by a higher power.”</p>
<p>“Risky?!” Riene screamed. “Becky, you’ll be  killed! You’ll all be killed! This is insanity!!” She grabbed  Rebecca’s arm, and Hill looked back at her, bolder and more  beautiful than she had ever been. It stunned Riene, and she let her  go.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Riene, but I want to go with them.  I…can’t explain why I feel this way, but…it’s like going out  to swim when the waves are so rough that you’re afraid of stepping  into the water. And yet those are the best times for swimming. I’m  going. I…I’ll talk to you later.” The White Angel of the <em>Dauntless</em> turned a corner and was gone, her lustrous hair and  pure wings leaving behind a trace of longing in Riene’s heart. She  reached out for Rebecca, because she loved her and she feared for  her, but could not move.</p>
<p>“No…Becky, wait,” she whispered hoarsely. There  was no use calling her back; she was determined to see this through,  even to the end. Thoughts of what her life would be life without  Rebecca haunted Riene’s thoughts, and with a determined push, she  broke away from her paralysis and ran after the woman she loved. No  matter what happened now, they would share the same fate.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Rebecca was not the only person who felt compelled to  visit Helios 2. Aseria was actually at the ramp before Amy, her bare  black skin almost glowing as the <em>Dauntless</em> fell through the  deadly Venusian atmosphere. Sharyn soon followed, smiling proudly,  awaiting this new adventure— and Lyara was by her side, of course,  a little shy as she starting undressing with her lover. There was  also Allegra and Kate, Fuuka and Athena, Shana, Herut, and Eve, and  even an enthusiastic Naja.</p>
<p>“So, you all just couldn’t resist! Any excuse to  get naked, right?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s because Amy has worked her way into  our hearts,” Athena said, smiling at Fuuka. Valti laughed as she  and Vimmy joined the group.</p>
<p>“So, it’s finally come down to an orgy! Arms, don’t  fail me now!” She started to undress, proud of her naked body  (having six arms puts a lot of things into perspective). Brignor  laughed at their reaction and said, “I’m only kidding! Look, it’s  not that I don’t have any faith in you, Amy— it’s just that I’m  wondering why we aren’t wearing any clothes. That’s normally  Chandra’s shtick.”</p>
<p>“Well excuse me for enjoying myself,” Chandra  snorted.</p>
<p>“It’s simple,” Amy replied as she disrobed. “It’s  very warm down there. And we won’t need them.” She even unraveled  her hair, removed her glasses, disposed of her cane, and took off the  bandages from her foot. Fuuka was about to admonish her, but Athena  held her back, silencing her. Mink and Rebecca soon arrived, and  Riene after them (which made Hill enormously happy). A few faces  turned red as they noticed all the bare skin, but once Amy offered  her childish explanation, it seemed like the best, and the only,  thing to do, even if there were a few doubts remaining. Rebecca and  Riene were particularly sketchy about undressing in front of  everyone— and each other— but all that nudity became fairly  comforting after a time. It was one thing to be naked before a group  of people in their clothes; it was entirely different sharing one’s  nudity with others. There was much less to be shamed about, and even  a little to be thankful for.</p>
<p>“You know,” Riene smiled as she spared a glimpse at  Rebecca, “your wings are very pretty. I mean…you’re very pretty  in general, but…”</p>
<p>“Um, thank you,” she replied, not daring to turn  around, lest she lose control. “I, um…I like them, too.” Soon  the only people missing were Rachel, Yenae, and Alala— and the  latter arrived just before the ship touched down on the harsh  surface. The Felinis was marching proudly, determined to follow Amy  into this dangerous journey, her hair combed and her fur washed and  scented. Her eyes were as determined as Miracle’s, and though she  was afraid of what was to come, she put a brave face on and stared at  the crew with a righteous passion as she crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“You’re not going anywhere without me.”</p>
<p>“I was hoping you’d come!” Amy exclaimed. She  actually looked beautiful now that she wasn’t wearing such a  humdrum outfit. Many people are improved by the clothes they wear;  Amy actually seemed improved by her nudity, even though her body was  hardly enviable. Alala smiled…well, cattily.</p>
<p>“I can’t just sit by and watch my friends risk life  and limb without me. So are we all going swimming or something?”</p>
<p>“You could say that,” Amy replied mysteriously.  Several people were confused by this statement and raised concern.</p>
<p>“Wait, swimming? On <em>Venus</em>? Okay, now I <em>know</em> she’s cracked.”</p>
<p>“So leave,” Valti said, giving Kyrie a shove. “More  naked goodness for us.” Kyrie grumbled at her ex-lover and decided  to stay just to spite her. Alala was about to lift her shirt off when  her stalker arrived, her timing as excellent as ever, and purred at  all the bare skin before her.</p>
<p>“Oh my, are we finally having an orgy?”</p>
<p>“See, see?!” Valti flailed. “It’s not just me!  You’re all thinking it— I’m actually saying it!!” Yenae  smiled for joy as she glomped her “fuzzy bums”; Alala turned red  and quickly covered herself up.</p>
<p>“You stay here!! I don’t need your lecherous paws  all over me!”</p>
<p>“Silly girl!” she sang. “Do you think I’m just  going to stay behind and let my huggy kitten go off into certain  doom? Of course not! I’m going with you!” And with that, she  began to undress, exposing beautiful roasted-umber skin and gorgeous  tattoos enveloping her lithe, muscular body. It was enough to make  Chandra jealous; Alala tried not to stare.</p>
<p>“Wh…why are you always following me around?!” she  stammered. “Urgh, you are <em>the most</em> annoying…”</p>
<p>“So you <em>don’t</em> want me to come with you, even  though I’m perfectly willing to risk my life? Or don’t you <em>believe</em> that I love you?”</p>
<p>“That…” She froze in anger and dragged the  mischievous imp away so they could talk in private. “This is not  the time or the place to discuss this! I’m going because I believe  in Amy, and she believes in me. You’re only going because— ”</p>
<p>“For the same reasons?” she said rhetorically. She  smiled warmly at Alala, and let the last of her clothes drop,  entrancing her with her love and beauty. Alala felt herself  suffocating; it was almost impossible to resist her now. “I’m  going because I believe in <em>you</em>, Alala. Because I love <em>you</em>.  That’s why I’m with you all the time. Even if you turn and walk  away, I will never stop loving you. Even if you really are heading  for your death, I will never stop following you. Even if you never  believe me, I…” She couldn’t say any more; her tears were  getting in the way, and she was shaking.</p>
<p>So Alala decided to do something she had yearned to do  for months, and held her.</p>
<p>“I love you too,” she whispered. Their eyes met and  she smiled through tears of her own. “I love you! And I’m sorry  it took me so long to— ”</p>
<p>She was silenced with a kiss that had been delayed far  too long.</p>
<p>“We can save the sweet nothings for later, darling.  Right now, we have an adventure before us. After that, we shall have  all the time we want to catch up.”</p>
<p>“But I want you right now,” Alala whispered,  staring hungrily into her eyes. Yenae laughed and helped undress her,  kissing until the Felinis was sated.</p>
<p>“I promise to be all the sweeter when we return.”  Alala nodded; they were ready.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, lovebirds!” Kate shouted as the duo  returned, their tails and hands entwined. Alala turned red and  screamed at her; Yenae just laughed and said how proud she was. Once  they amassed next to their companions, twenty-three nude women ready  to face their deadliest challenge yet— many of them conflicted with  their uncertainty, yet ready to follow Amy even into the gates of  Hell— the <em>Dauntless</em> landed, and they prepared themselves.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The hatch opened, a gust of air blew into the ship…</p>
<p>And their world was unmade.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>The first sensation they remembered was the crash of  waves against a shore.</p>
<p>The experience of stepping into this alien world was  very much like being born: first you have to shut your eyes because  the light is so powerful, and then your skin tingles and pricks up as  an entirely new environment wraps itself around you. Soon you can  listen to the noise, or the music, the world has to offer, but your  eyes are still shut, tears streaking out as you strain, with  unyielding desire, to see what you have spent so much of your  “pre-life” reaching for. While this is going on, the sensations  divide themselves, and become sharper and easier to recognize; if  they did not, if they came at you all at once, it would be agony, far  more unbearable than the worst pains.</p>
<p>First of all, the sounds: waves against the shore, a  volcanic and cacophonous harmony of roaring foam and churning wind  and water approaching, thrashing itself against solid surface, guided  by forces beyond control or comprehension— each lap, splash, and  wave acting wholly on the planet’s shifting moods: calm or fierce,  tranquil or upset, loving or merciless. Following this, an even  greater division of sensations as the crash of water becomes distinct  from the song of birds— or perhaps it should be said that they were  flying creatures, for a great many of them made songs sharply  contrasting the shrill, chirruping flute.</p>
<p>It sounded like there were chimes rushing in the air,  hand-crafted glass and metal tinkling against itself in the breeze,  or the somber noise of brass and bronze striking, bells tolling, and  the great laughter of wind that whirled as the creatures who made  these songs— creatures who could fly but were certainly not birds—  soared as kings and queens in the most startling world yet. But oh,  the song of the birds! Can you still hear it? Can you ever remember a  song that made you weep more openly, a melody that paralyzed you with  its sweetness, a <em>Gloria</em> that surpassed all of time, and space,  and left you breathless? Can you hear them? Can you remember?</p>
<p>And now, Venus delivered her rich perfumes and her  gentle breezes. It was a hot world, certainly, and one could tell  just by standing there that clothes were really unnecessary, but the  warmth was neither stifling nor intolerable: you felt like you could  live in it and shun the shade for all your years. The breeze was also  warm, but more like a perfume wafting across the sea, carrying salt  and spices and fragrances so far removed from anything else  discovered that you could almost mistake them for colors, or images,  or even a quiet undertone to the Venusian symphony. There was also a  twinge of fruit, unmistakable in the aromatic air, and of living  creatures— perhaps the birds, perhaps the other creatures that  flew— and of strange plants and flowers come from afar.</p>
<p>It was a spectacular way to be introduced to the  Morning Star. Having everything thrown at them at once would be  overpowering, even if everything were beautiful. They could endure  the filth of other worlds; they could not endure this beauty for long  unless they were guided into it gradually. Not for nothing were they  blinded by their own tears and sensational awe. But now their vision  returned to them, allowing pictures to fill in for the songs, and the  perfumes, and the warmth that seemed to rise up from the very ground  and the sea and the air and the golden ceiling above.</p>
<p>They could not see the sun. As far as the eye could  tell, from distant glimmering white horizon to the rich, almost  orange apex of sky above, the world was clothed in gold, gold, gold,  beautiful juicy bullion as soft as liquid and as majestic as  creation. It made sense when you understood that Venus’s atmosphere  was much thicker than the Earth, that they had a veil to protect them  from the overwhelming embrace of Deep Heaven, and that no outsider—  or Venusian— could see past this barrier. There was no sun because  it cast its unfiltered light everywhere. And now their curiosity  drove them to see what in all the world made that harmonic glittering  sound— of bells and chimes and metal— and they looked up,  squinting in the golden morning, first observing the birds whose song  they had recognized, and then the object of their desires, deep  crimson and golden-orange creatures with scales and membrane, horns  and great flailing whiskers, hands and feet webbed and clawed, tails  long, sleek, and muscular, and eyes dark, deep with wisdom,  penetrating and somber. They realized they were dragons.</p>
<p>Now their thoughts turned to more earthly matters.  Their vessel was forgotten behind them, stretched out on an empty,  flat plane that seemed like it was designated only for that purpose.  Below them, the ground was as firm and golden-green as you could hope  for, with some heathery growth and plants that were like seaweed,  like palms, like pines— and a ziggurat. But before they could  notice this, they had to take the ocean into account, for it was  their welcoming committee, a sea wilder and greater than any body  they had seen, the waves furious like a squall’s, ever-shifting and  rolling, an aquatic countryside that was never the same shape twice.  Beyond it, far on the outer edge of the utmost horizon, a few people  swore they saw islands— or perhaps there were just whales, for the  tiny silvery shapes faded if you stared at them long enough,  vanishing with the roaring sea.</p>
<p>Many of the birds (and the dragons) made the island  they had landed on their home. The dragons were, not surprisingly,  hardly bigger than the birds; some you could fit in the palm of your  hand. When they flew, they sounded like wind chimes; one or two of  the longer ones were coiled around the trees, sleeping like a snake  might. Having the slightest glimpse of the island gave way to even  greater curiosity, for now the crew put their full attention to the  ziggurat. They realized their error in judgment as they looked upon  it, for no hand made this save the hand that made the world. They  were rocks, long tall rectangular rocks carved with uncanny  precision, a massive stairway fit for a giant that reached up, up,  up, up into the auric sky.</p>
<p>Normally words are quite slow, and by the time you  finish reading them, hours or days or centuries may have already  passed. This time, however, the words run too quickly: it took nearly  an hour for the crew to absorb and understand everything around them.  Never mind the sheer, petrifying beauty of this radical environment:  they were also stricken dumb by how greatly mistaken all their  preconceived notions had been, and how a Hell like the one they read  about could ever be anything like this. None of them dared to move,  or even to speak, lest they break the exquisite design around them  and show themselves as an affront to everything sacred and pure. So  they just stood there, full of awe, their mouths open and their eyes  bursting with tears— never tiring, never ceasing to be amazed.</p>
<p>It was Miracle, of all people, who finally spoke.</p>
<p>“Behold, Perelandra, the Living Paradise.” She  faced her friends with wind-whipped hair, glowing with golden light  from the atmosphere above them. She knew exactly what was going  through their minds: she knew they needed an explanation. “Protected  since its ascension eons ago by a Craft far more powerful than the  glory of Atlantis and Alfheim, accessible only to those who are  permitted to come, she is a Heaven disguised as a Hell, the ultimate  safeguard for her people until the time comes for her barrier to  break, for Deep Heaven to penetrate her virginal shell, for  Perelandrians to fully rise into the Field of Arbol and make  themselves known, when all may walk upon her islands and swim of her  seas. That is the truth of the grand deception— that none may come  here or see Perelandra for what she is without Her consent. Only a  select few have been given this privilege before. This is my second.”</p>
<p>She descended toward the nearby ocean, standing upright  for the first time since anyone could remember, temporarily freed  from her curse now that she was in a world that had transcended pain  and suffering. Her heel still bled— splotches of red puddles  trickled to the rich surface— but it seeped so thinly that Miracle  hardly noticed. Like Aphrodite wading back into the foam from whence  she sprang, Miracle stepped into the heavenly ocean, bent down, and—  to everyone’s surprise— drank from the abundant waters. The group  was still petrified with awe, but a few of them snapped out of their  daze and ran into the shore, acutely thirsty. Herut reached them  first, bent down, took a sip…</p>
<p>“It’s good,” she exclaimed aloud. Everyone  followed her example but remained silent; they still wanted to absorb  everything and make it a part of themselves. Not only were the waters  of Venus potable, but delicious and refreshing, better than the  purest, coldest spring water. One felt energized and strangely  satisfied after a few draughts, as if they had eaten a magnificent  banquet that fulfilled both body and soul.</p>
<p>“Wow, it <em>is</em> good,” Aseria stated. She had  dined on the fanciest morsels, the rarest delicacies, and the most  expensive and hard-to-make dishes in all the galaxy, yet now she knew  she would only be eating dust ever after, and would forever thirst  for this water. She took another drink, but had to force herself to  stop, or else she would burst. A few of the others had better  discipline; Mink stopped after only one mouthful, and Valti satisfied  with just three sips.</p>
<p>“Now I know why this planet is so well-protected,”  Riene stated. “If people knew about this place, they would launch  an invasion and slaughter one another for this water.” She looked  over to get a response from Rebecca, temporarily forgetting their  nudity. Their eyes met, wandered around…and suddenly they realized  that their lack of clothing was the least of their concerns. It might  be hard to imagine, but nakedness no longer concerned them, probably  because it felt so natural to be that way in a world like this. The  original Father and Mother knew no shame in their paradise; why  should there be any here? Even so, they learned quite a lot about  each other. As they stared and smiled, they both thought the exact  same thing:</p>
<p><em>Wow, so that’s her </em><em><u>natural</u></em><em> hair color!</em></p>
<p>“Perelandra has far more to offer than water,” Amy  said, now crouching by the shore. She reached her hand out and  half-sang, half-called for something. At first, nobody could notice  any change in the sea, but those who had sharper eyes spotted a  shockwave, or a splash, soaring through the wild waves, ripples  foaming and churning in its wake. A large silvery-black object was  swimming through the water, powerful like a torpedo but graceful as a  dolphin, coming to a gentle halt and poking a large, bullet-shaped  head out of the sea, a spark of animal intelligence in its huge,  glassy eyes. It looked like a fish, but was as large as a manatee,  and its back was flat and round, like a tadpole. The others stared at  it warily, but only because it was an alien creature, and all living  beings are cautious of that which is different.</p>
<p>The fish meant no harm and allowed Amy to ride it. It  suddenly occurred to everyone that this made a great deal of sense,  and that if you wanted to get anywhere on Venus, you would have to  summon a fish and ride upon it, or else swim and hope for the best.  Herut, the one nearest to Amy, stood up and peered over the  bluish-whitish-gold horizon, searching for the dots of land she had  spotted earlier. She screwed up her eyes, cringed, stood on her toes,  and even asked mink to hold her on her shoulders— but she couldn’t  see anything.</p>
<p>“What are you looking for?” Mink said.</p>
<p>“I thought I saw some land in the distance. Must’ve  been my imagination.”</p>
<p>“It’s not your imagination,” Miracle said.  “Perelandra has Fixed Land, which we’re on right now, and  Shifting Lands, which is what you saw. This area is forbidden to the  natives, but there’s another Fixed Land that I have come all this  way to visit. The Shifting Lands— ”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, wait! Back up a second! Are you saying  that <em>people</em> live here?”</p>
<p>“Not on this land,” she explained patiently. “On  the Shifting Islands. They’re forbidden to come here, or at least  to sleep here. Like I was saying, the Shifting Lands— ”</p>
<p>“But you also mentioned somewhere you came to visit.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right: the Holy Mountain of Aphallin.  In a way, it was the reason I started this voyage in the first place.  Anyway, the Shifting Lands ride on the w— ”</p>
<p>“But why didn’t you just go here at the  beginning?!” the Acherons demanded. “Why did we run around half  the galaxy when we could’ve just come here instead?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t the answer obvious?” she snickered. “First  of all, nobody wanted to come here. I told you right from the  beginning that we would go anywhere you pleased, and we have.  Secondly, I wasn’t allowed to come until just recently. In fact, I  might be a little early.”</p>
<p>“A little early?! For what?”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain it later…if I can. Now— before  I’m interrupted again— the Shifting Lands— ”</p>
<p>“This is crazy,” Naja gushed as she fell to the  ground. Everyone else looked just as exhausted. Amy sighed in  frustration.</p>
<p>“You know what? I’ll let you find out for  yourselves. If you’ll excuse me, I’ll be heading off to Aphallin  now, but you’re all free to do as you please. I would recommend,  however, that you spend the night on the Shifting Islands. I’ll see  you later.”</p>
<p>“But…” Amy either didn’t hear or chose to  ignore her crew; in any case, she mounted the fish, kicked its sides,  and hung on as it swam through the ocean, as fast as a car, fading  and disappearing into a tiny speck in the ocean. She was gone.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t help us much,” Naja grumbled. She  took another drink and decided to try her luck, moving to the shore  and calling a fish. This time, a whole school swam up to her, their  sleek, bulbous heads enthusiastic and wise, eager to bear their  masters wherever they chose. Naja was a little overwhelmed and picked  the furthest one away from her, reasoning that it would not have to  cram through its excitable siblings. She had to swim a little, and  climbing on the fish was harder than Amy made it look, but eventually  she mounted it and rode off into the horizon— a frightening through  since nobody knew where anything was. They quickly decided to stay  together as a team and followed the Elshyrin’s example.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” Riene sighed as she approached the large  fish. Everyone had already ridden off, leaving just her. It wasn’t  as if she didn’t want to go exploring— hearing about these  Shifting Islands aroused a desire that surpassed hunger and thirst  and even love— it’s just that…well, she was afraid she would  drown. Oh, that fish certainly looked large enough and sturdy enough  to support her, but should she lose her grip, or fall, or be cast  aside if it turned sharply… And she had no idea where the closest  shore <em>was</em>. She put her bare feet in the water, felt revived,  and approached the school. There were still plenty of fish left in  the sea; it was almost as if they were floating there to give her a <em>choice</em>. She wondered if it was possible to discern the  steadiest among them when one of her companions rode back, straddling  her steed with perfect grace. It was Rebecca.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I forgot,” she said with an  apologetic smile. “You’re not very comfortable around the water,  are you? Here, hop on with me. I’ll hold onto you so you don’t  fall off. These wings give me really great balance!”</p>
<p>“Uh…I appreciate it,” she stammered. Rebecca  helped her mount the beast, their hands clasping tightly, their faces  aglow with scarlet, golden light, and told her how to hold on with  her hands and legs. It was not unlike riding a horse, which Riene had  a great deal of skill with. She felt her entire body exploding with  renewed joy and excitement as Rebecca clutched onto her shoulders—  and then timidly put her arms around her naked waist— and clung  tight. It would have been a sexual act were it not for the purity of  Venus, the delights they had succumbed to earlier, and the  peculiarity of their situation. Riene leaned back, into Rebecca’s  safe care, and smiled brightly as they sailed off together, powered  by strong fins and strong wings.</p>
<p>Riding on the fish gave everyone time to reflect on  what they had seen. Shana felt despair, for she knew she was unworthy  of replicating this ethereal utopia onto canvas, even with her skill.  She would ache at the very memory of it ever after, and would always  be yearning to return, even if only to catch one more glimpse. But  she knew it was her task to replicate these worlds, even though she  may fail, and show them to Alan. Surely Venus would be her very last,  though: there would be no point in painting now that she came across  perfection. Mink, too, was in a hopeless daze: she had barely even  moved since her arrival. Joff was a beautiful, enchanting paradise,  unspoiled by the outer civilizations and untouched by modern  technology, but it seemed ugly and coarse now: she despaired  returning home for fear of drawing a comparison.</p>
<p>Aseria was not one for weeping, but now she couldn’t  stop, and had to drag her black arm across her face every few  seconds. Alfheim, too, was a utopia, and in her life she had visited  worlds that took her breath away and brought her to her knees, but  never— not even in her most fantastic dreams— had she imagined  such a place as this ever existed. She felt a surge run through her  blood, in and out of her skin and around her bones until it  penetrated every cell in her body and shot out of her like rays of  light from the sun. She looked over at her distant cousin and  wondered if Lyara was feeling the same— that in some unexplainable  way, they had at last come to a world that resembled their Home, the  Undying Lands of the True West, where elves were said to first  originate. The sea had always made Aseria feel melancholy, and now it  was all around her. But then she finally sighted the Shifting Islands  Amy spoke about, and forgot all about these feelings. Here was  something that surpassed them all.</p>
<p>If their first arrival to Venus had brought silent awe  and majesty, their approach to the Shifting Islands drew this out and  strengthened it until it was no longer a mere feeling, but a way of  living— a thought, an ideal, a real, tangible object they could  take in their hands and squeeze. The shore lapped against the  shifting land, and the fish strayed close to the shore, indicating  that they could all swim from here on. Fuuka was the first; she had  never felt healthier in all her life: not when she met Athena, not  before she came down with her terminal illness, not even when she  made love. An energy burst through her and, if it did not tear her  apart first, it gave her the sensation of floating, gracefully  soaring into the thrilling air and falling back down again upon soft,  springy, heathery surface, laughing and giggling as she rolled  around.</p>
<p>“Whoa!” Athena cried out as she tried to join her  lover, and fell flat on her face. But if there was any pain, it was  only with her pride: the fall was as pleasant and enjoyable as  collapsing on pillows. She laughed as well, in spite of her hardcore  stoicism, and pounced on Fuuka so they could play and wrestle. Valti  had a slightly better time of it, since having four extra limbs gave  her improved balance. She lasted all of two steps before stumbling;  Naja decided to crawl along the ground, and got considerably further.  She made it to a tree and used it to climb back up to her feet.</p>
<p>“What’s up with this place?” she wondered, too  content to curse. Everyone tentatively followed them, but they all  met the same fate: they all stumbled and fell, and laughed as they  bounced and worked their way up again. There was no doubt now that  these were Shifting Islands, for their surface was not a constant  like the surfaces of many other worlds, but rolling, pitching,  swerving, and undulating, like the sea. Walking on it was very much  like trying to cross one of those “Moonwalk” rides. The surface  was just as unstable and shaky, with only the slightest bit of  firmness there that kept you from slipping through. Treading it took  careful timing and delicate grace, but if you fell, you just met a  pleasant end, and with the warm weather, the pungent perfumes, and  the thrilling freedom of nudity, you saw little reason to get back up  again— perhaps only so you could wobble around and fall.</p>
<p>Rebecca cheated; she managed to prevent herself from  stumbling by using her wings. It was the first time anybody saw her  exercise her newfound skill, and more than a few were jealous. This  made her feel better about her situation, more proud of her  “deformity”. Up until now, she had been struggling to merely  accept them; now she was slowly embracing her new self. They might  have been father’s only gift, but they were a greater treasure than  she could ask for. She wondered if, one day, she would be able to  really fly with them.</p>
<p>“I get it now!” Lillianne shouted, in response to  Naja’s question. It had taken her awhile to guess the secret behind  the islands’ strange behavior, largely due to adjusting herself to  its movements. When she acquired some semblance of balance, Lil could  glance out over the ocean and spot another Shifting Island, and  easily deduce its behavior. The island they first landed on was  indeed fixed; these rolled and moved with the waves, so that if the  ocean was calm, then the islands took a fairly flat appearance, and  if there was a storm…</p>
<p>“They’re not tethered down to the ground,” she  noted. “That’s unbelievable. I mean, I’ve been to a few gas  worlds where they have floating continents, and I’ve been on ships  in the ocean…but this is completely different. It’s like  spreading a giant towel over the water and then trying to walk on it.  No wonder we keep falling.”</p>
<p>“At least it doesn’t hurt,” Shana said. She had  already tried to determine what was underneath the soil, and  discovered a layer of tough, interwoven fibers that kept everything  afloat. The Acherons had swam out to see what was underneath, and  described it as “something a jellyfish would have”. Sacks of  membrane were stuffed underneath, acting as flotation devices; this,  combined with the fiber, kept the islands afloat on the endless seas.  But even the islands did not keep their shape for long: sometimes the  wind and the waves saw fit to break them apart, or to mesh them  together, so that an island one day would be a continent the next,  and vice-versa. It was a wild and unpredictable world but still  Paradise by any definition.</p>
<p>“Oh!” Aseria exclaimed as she sat up. “What’s  that smell?”</p>
<p>“Which one?”</p>
<p>“It’s so distinct from the others. It smells like  food…but I really can’t be sure anymore. Even the water and the  air smell different here.”</p>
<p>“Should we really be eating so soon?” Mink  wondered. “Drinking without food is different than eating without  drink.”</p>
<p>“I know, and…I don’t feel particularly hungry,  but…oh, I just want to look, I want to <em>see</em>…” She  wandered off aimlessly in search of whatever could be giving off that  wonderful aroma, stumbling and slipping every so often. A few of the  others followed, especially Fuuka, whose nose was perhaps the  sharpest and could pick out the smell most distinctively. She  remembered a dream of hers where she came across a secret garden, by  herself, and was allowed into the gate, on the condition that she  pick only one fruit. The garden was lush and teeming with choice  delicacies that would make Kings grovel and Queens prostrate, but she  resisted them all, focusing on a single, spherical blossom that  glowed like a tiny sun. The dream ended as she touched the fruit and  was changed; into what, she never knew. But she felt she recognized  that smell, and followed it aggressively, even bending down to run on  all fours.</p>
<p>As Athena and the others followed (as best they could),  they found themselves running into a grove that contained fruit of a  very glassy, opaque nature. The trees were rather smallish, so if you  weren’t watching where you were going, and if it was a level field,  you’d run right into the fruit. They picked their way through  delicately; Kyrie reached up, with her scientist’s inquisitiveness,  and plucked one of the fruits, but it burst as soon as she touched  it, exploding into a gooey, translucent liquid that was not unlike  soapy water. After smelling and tasting it, she decided it was unfit  for consumption, and wondered what it was for. When Eve accidentally  stumbled into a bushel and got her face all wet, it was decided that  these were bubble-trees, and that running through a grove of them was  better and more exciting than a shower.</p>
<p>It felt like hours before anybody could start seriously  walking: hours of bent knees, arms stretched out, carefully watching  the contours of the environment and anticipating a sudden curve or  slope. During those hours, they went from tree to tree, grasping and  being splashed in the process, or falling and lying in the sun,  growing more ignorant about their state of undress. They might have  mastered their legs sooner, were it not for the joy of falling and  the comfort of the ground below them; indeed, a handful chose not to  move at all, but rather stayed behind, basking and drinking, content  with little else. But even rich water requires food, and eventually  everyone had to try their legs. Those who worked hardest were finally  able to catch up to those who had better balance (Alala, Yenae,  Valti, Rebecca, and especially the smaller ladies), and when they  did, they discovered the source of the pleasant aroma that had been  drifting through Venus like the music of dragons’ flight.</p>
<p>The trees had slender bark, as curvy as the islands  they were planted on, and yet they were more erect than any of the  visitors, for they stood firm upon the thin ground and seemed as  deeply-rooted as mountains. At first their fruit looked like grapes,  for they were perfectly round and clustered close together; however,  each orb was the size of an orange, and glowed like the sun. If you  listened very closely, you could hear the music getting just a little  quieter and a little more solemn around them— or maybe it was just  a trick of the wind. In any case, it was impossible to get to them  without climbing, so Athena volunteered. It wasn’t until she got a  good footing that she remembered she had left her sword behind.</p>
<p>“Let me try,” Rebecca said. She jumped as high as  she could, and, straining, flapped her wings furiously, staying  airborne for a few seconds before returning to the ground. As she  tried this again, Naja slithered up impatiently and took a huge  cluster in her hands. Normally she would have devoured the whole  thing— the whole tree if it were possible— but something buried  deep into her soul told her to refrain from greed, if only just this  once. She picked off several golden orbs and tossed them to her  companions, taking only one for herself. The rind seemed hard, and at  first, nobody knew how they could eat them— but then Allegra  accidentally slipped her finger through the skin, penetrating deep,  and soon everyone began to eat.</p>
<p>They had meant to extract the smallest experimental  nibble, but the first taste put all their caution away. It was,  naturally, a taste, just as everything else had been an image or a  sound or a scent, but then it was so different from every other taste  that it seemed formal and stiff to say <em>taste</em> at all. It was  more like a discovery, something unheard, beyond all reckoning or  language. That everyone got her own unique reaction to the fruit  proved its power. You couldn’t generalize it because everyone’s  response was radically different, and yet they all reached the same  conclusion. If the water would draw people to battle, a single taste  of this fruit would cause genocide and betrayal. Before anyone could  render speech or thought to it, the fruit was gone, every bit  devoured with meticulous care; they did not want to miss a single  speck. Several were about to reach for another, but they stopped  themselves, just as Naja had stopped.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t be right,” Eve said, pulling herself  away from a cluster. “There is such a thing as too much goodness.  It’s just like the water. We should move on for something else.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I agree,”  Lil said. She looked to Aseria, who had been weighing a second gourd  with deep thought and care. Even Naja had refused a second helping;  the Sindar put it away reluctantly.</p>
<p>“I should never have come to this place,” she  murmured mournfully. “Now I think I will not want to leave, not  even for all the galaxy. And yet…I do believe I must. It’s going  to be painful, see, because we’ll be moving out of goodness into  filth. Everything outside of this golden dome is in such <em>ruins</em>.  There can no longer be any beauty for me.”</p>
<p>“Snap out of it,” Yenae said, giving her a gentle  kick. “Stand up and be a woman about it! There’s good and then  there’s Good. I for one have things to look forward to when we  leave! I’m going to explore a bit of this place, see what kind of  people they have. Don’t sit there moping when we’ve got  perfection all around us. Alala?” The Felinis had climbed another  tree and was bringing down something that looked like nuts, or beans,  or some small fruit that was vaguely familiar. She gave one to Yenae  and another to Aseria; when she ate it, she stood up again, and was  content. This must’ve been “ordinary” Venusian fare, the kind  you might say a special blessing over, while the golden gourds  required a benediction or meditation.</p>
<p>“Might want to reconsider,” she said, looking at  the horizon. The Venus that Earth natives knew and the Venus they  were walking on right now had at least one thing in common: they both  revolved in the same direction. The western sky was darkening very  quickly, and with no electricity, no fire, no stars, and no moon, it  would grow pitch black soon. A few of the girls were afraid, but  Shana at least looked like she was prepared.</p>
<p>“I think as long as we stay here, we shouldn’t have  anything to worry about. I haven’t seen any dangerous animals—  those dragons looked harmless to me— and we won’t have to worry  about getting cold. I can see now why Amy said we should spend the  night here! I wouldn’t want to walk or sleep on that awful hard  ground if I could help it.”</p>
<p>“But it was just morning a few…” Kyrie stopped  herself and reconsidered what she was saying. Without any clear  direction where the sun was, it was impossible to tell the time, so  it very well may have been late afternoon, or even early evening,  when they first arrived. Even if that were not so, they had spent a  lot of time drinking in the Venusian world, and riding on the fish,  and learning how to walk, and eating.</p>
<p>“I know, we thought that Venus’s daily cycle was  243 Earth-days long, which is actually longer than its year.”</p>
<p>“But a lot of our preconceptions about this planet  were proven wrong today.”</p>
<p>“We’re on a world where anything is possible.”</p>
<p>“A bit unnerving, but also very exciting.” The  Acherons smiled and nodded at each other. Night came sooner than  anyone expected, and it was darker and deeper than they had imagined.  If you have ever been so deep in a cave, when they turn the lights  out for a moment, where you can’t tell if your eyes are shut or  open, you can understand the depth of blackness that surrounded them.  But the waves were still rolling, the perfumes were still drifting in  the sky, and the soft coo and purr of birds and dragons— along with  the night-call of other animal life— were still crying, and that  made their rest all the more settling. Even so, nobody could be  blamed for clinging to someone throughout the night.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>All this time Amy Blithe Miracle had been making her  way to the Holy Mountain Aphallin, the only other Fixed Land on Venus  and the only one of its kind the natives could dwell upon. She was on  a journey that was nearly three years in the making, now facing a  future that could either lead to its conclusion, or its indefinite  continuation. She never told anyone the true purpose of her mission—  out of shame, neglect, or necessity— but now, three years after it  first began, she would come here to see the next stage, what she was  expected to do, and what possibilities would come of it. Venus was,  after all, the place where she received her wound that would not  heal, and on Venus, she hoped, a cure could finally be found.</p>
<p>She knew her way to Aphallin well; she had underwent  excruciating pain to visit that sanctuary, and any moment that causes  you that sort of agony is not something you can easily forget. Her  heel had been the least of her worries, although back then, the wound  was fresh and the pain closer to her heart. Now she could bear it,  with some difficulty, and now that she was within the sphere of  Venus, the burden was even easier. But body and soul had been torn  apart during her first journey; now she could pick her way through as  an experienced veteran, one who knew the twists and turns and  potential dangers still in her way. She could, essentially, arrive  without too much difficulty— without too much, but not without  none.</p>
<p>She was not on her way to the mountain just to see the  mountain itself, or anything else the island might hold for her.  Perhaps she also knew that merely healing her injury was not the true  purpose for her return, although she could certainly hope it would be  added. Miracle had been suffering for three years and exploring half  the galaxy for a better reason than that: she was going to keep an  appointment, not with a native but another outsider, specifically a  man: the oldest, wisest, most powerful, and most important man  living, though only a small number would recognize his name and  office.</p>
<p>Yet even this was not the true reason for her voyage.  Merely meeting a man, or even adding him to her crew, would not be  enough. She could only guess what her return would yield, what her  meeting would enable her to accomplish. Perhaps his assistance, or  guidance; perhaps a tool, or some information; perhaps merely an  answer. She had only met him once and he had rebuked her harshly—  but he had also sent her out on her long, arduous journey. Yes, she  was going to meet the very person responsible for all this, in a  sense. But of course he would not have been responsible if <em>she</em> were not; the two of them began everything together, and would  hopefully end it as well.</p>
<p>Long ago she had been instructed to visit this  seemingly-hostile world, and was guaranteed safe arrival— but  little else. She had been given no sense of direction and no clear  purpose, until a voice called out to her several weeks later, almost  imperceptible above the ocean’s roar and her own doubts, telling  her to look to the wide open sea. From there she drifted, as she  drifted now, hopelessly lost yet compelled to obey— desiring  obedience. She had not been told what to look for but could not  mistake it once she saw it: a great piercing mountain straddling the  only other solid piece of Venusian land, a peak that seemed  inaccessible but was easier to climb than she thought. There, inside  a grand cavern that was illuminated by fire from below and glowing  crystalline formations above, she had supped upon the inner fruits  and met the man to whom she had been destined to see. She had  bestowed to him a gift, and in return, he had sent her on her  journey. The injury she had sustained during her mother’s accident  remained, even to this very day.</p>
<p>“So that I may not forget,” she sighed, clasping  her ankle as her steed took a break. He had been swimming for hours—  for a day and a night— and needed to rest his fins. Miracle  wondered if she could summon another fish and resume her travels. She  knew there were Mer-folk beneath the waves, as far removed from other  Mer-folk as the natives of this world were from other humans.  Director Astor’s wife was a descendant of that race; so was Sharyn  and her people, if she wasn’t mistaken. The green skin and majestic  innocence (so regal and austere as opposed to the sweet, stupefying  innocence of children) were giveaways; their sexuality was proof that  the lineage was long and winding. No proper Perelandrian dabbled like  Sharyn— or her father.</p>
<p>Another fish came and took over the work of its  brother. Miracle slept lightly while it was still dark, clutching the  fish with her limbs, and woke as a wave slapped her face, refreshing  and alarming her. She stopped to visit a few lonely Shifting Islands  and pick fruit for her journey, only taking as much as she could hold  (since she obviously didn’t have any pockets). She yearned to get  another glimpse of the beautiful, wise natives, but knew her journey  would take her away from them, and was content simply to be back. The  last stage of her journey was coming: she would soon keep her  appointment with the man, and after that…</p>
<p>“Probably not a good idea to think too much about the  future,” she reasoned. Even if this man were to help her, she could  not foresee how: he was no ordinary creature. Miracle had a faint  idea where he came from and what his purpose was, because he had  given her Solomon’s Ring, the only article she wore, and entrusted  one of the last free Djinni to her care. Possessing such an item  indicated he must’ve been as ancient as history itself, at the very  least, though Amy believed he reached even further than that, back  beyond the rise of the oldest civilizations, long before pagan gods  roamed the world, before the construction of the UCM, before space  travel was even possible. And in truth, this is what she had truly  been sent out to see: not a man, but an age.</p>
<p>For the tales of Plato and Tolkien were not entirely  fictional. Once upon a time, there <em>had</em> been a real Atlantis, a  real Numenor, a continent of wisdom, learning, and majesty eons  before the oldest known country, that rose into power and sank in the  sea back when the Earth was very young, just before the final Ice Age  that wiped Midgard clean. The man she had been sent out to meet was  the very last survivor of the Numenorean disaster, the last to cross  the sea and set foot in merry Middle-Earth, the student of  Ar-Pharazon the Golden, the proudest and most powerful king of  Numenor. His name was Oris and he had been given the office of  Pendragon.</p>
<p>He had been the very first— passing it to  Cassibelaun, who gave it to Uther, who gave it to Arthur. And now,  through a succession of over two-hundred Pendragons, he was the very  last. This was the man Miracle was going to meet.</p>
<p>Her successor.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>It took Miracle two days and three fish to arrive at  the island, but it would probably take her another day to arrive at  the appointed designation. First she had to make it to shore and  carefully avoid the small, kangaroo-like mice scurrying along the  sand, sniffling and hopping and gathering grains for their homes. She  found a very familiar vine and snatched a cluster of grapes, resting  and regaining her strength for the final leg of her journey. When she  first arrived here, she had spent countless days resting and eating—  partially because she was exhausted and wounded from scraping around,  partially because she knew she would need the strength of the planet  for her voyage. Now she only paused for an hour. She respectfully  buried the stems and the seeds and resumed her travels, wondering if  she would see any native pilgrims here.</p>
<p>Explaining and describing her long trek would take more  pages than I would like to devote, and it mainly consisted of  walking, limping, climbing, squeezing through crevasses and openings,  stopping to rest, some sleep, and fleeting moments where she  encountered Venusian animal life. She remembered one particularly  engrossing animal wandering the caverns where she met the Pendragon:  large, segmented, long skinny legs, mandibles, a narrow, curved  head…she had been frightened of the giant centipede-like creature,  but there was no reason for it. Why <em>should</em> she be afraid of  something if it had more legs than she did? It had meant no harm and  was merely passing through, digging more tunnels and searching for  the strange mushrooms that no other animal could consume. It had  actually looked fairly beautiful in the bluish-red light.</p>
<p>Miracle was thrilled to tearful paralysis as she  stopped and listened to a familiar song. She didn’t dare move, and  though she was not tired, she sat down and waited for another friend  to appear. Describing this animal took a bit more work, because it  had the legs and size of a horse, but was really more like a fawn,  and its head was shaped like a tapir’s, yet it made a noise even  more beautiful than the birds or the dragons. She recognized the song  but only saw a glimpse of the creature before it scampered away. They  were very shy creatures and usually lived in the caverns, but perhaps  they lived in the jungles, too. She picked herself up, wincing as  another gush of blood trickled out her foot, and moved on.</p>
<p>Gradually she found the mountain she had been looking  for, picking through trees and crushing beneath her pale rosy flowers  that were like violets, or carnations, or lilies, silken and frail to  the touch, and the only place in the world where her injury would go  unnoticed. She found she had to climb again and set herself to it,  using frail, wobbly fingers and frail, bruised knees to hoist herself  up a rock face. Only an athlete could have done this on any other  world; the climb seemed impossible but was actually enjoyable the  higher you got up. Amy remembered falling once, onto the red flowers,  and was startled when she couldn’t tell if she had been bleeding or  merely covered with petals. Now, though, she was an experienced  woman, albeit still clumsy, and only had a few scratches to show for  her ascent. A native would’ve made it look as easy as walking: she  knew; she had seen them do it. Too bad there weren’t any around.</p>
<p>There was a passage in the mountain that led directly  to the room where she had first met the Pendragon. Amy had been dizzy  with anxiety on her first trip, and was not much improved now,  although she had also been relishing this. It was very much like  preparing to meet someone important, who you know is good, but also  very powerful. Amy imagined this was what Dorothy and her friends  felt like when they went to see the Wizard, except this Wizard was  real, and incredibly ancient, and very, very dangerous.</p>
<p>The passage went on for about half a mile, Amy leaving  a scarlet trail to follow later. As she approached the end of the  path, she could see the glow of the great cavern, hallway of Kings  and Queens, from which the first Male and Female of this world  reigned, with all of their descendents. She hoped in vain to see at  least one of them there, but knew that only one man would be there  now— that is, if she wasn’t too early. He <em>did</em> say to  arrive in three years’ time, and if anything, Wizards are punctual  to a fault. As she stepped out of the passage into the cavern, she  heard singing, and knew she had come to the final stage of her  journey.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to describe what sort of song  this was, what it was about, what the lyrics were (if any), how long  it had been going on, and when it would end. Amy assumed it wouldn’t  be long, though: the singer was none other than the Pendragon, his  back to her, his arms upraised, his long flowing hair weaving and  bobbing with his subtle gestures, his shadow flickering in six  different spots, cast by the light of crystals above. She stood  watching him, transfixed, for an uncertain period of time; then, he  stopped singing and turned his head a little.</p>
<p>“Pray, be seated, for you have come before the  appointed hour, yet I would not turn you away, Mirari.” Amy obeyed  and hugged her knees to her chest as the Pendragon finished his song.  She was quickly absorbed into the beautiful, enchanting melody— as  beyond the mundane glory of the horse-fawn as it had been beyond the  birds and the dragons, and they a choir, and they the voice of one.  He sang and chanted in a voice that had been lost to the ages, in a  language long extinct, perhaps one even Riene would never comprehend  (though Merovians might). Amy could pick out a few repeated words and  some phrases she recognized from her years studying under Professor  Nimrod, but the rest was garbled: wonderfully garbled, though. It was  like saying rhythm and harmony itself had words, and you could  understand them if you listened well enough. The voice was never the  same twice; it never followed any pattern; you felt like you could  listen to it for the rest of your life. Amy felt herself fall away  from time and space, and wondered if this was what death felt like.  It was surely the most spiritual experience of her life.</p>
<p>The Pendragon stopped exactly when he meant to, lowered  his arms, and completely turned around to face his visitor. He wore  clothes, such as his office dictated, but seemed no more ashamed or  concerned with Amy’s nudity than she was. The robes could possibly  be described as greenish, and yellow, red, lavender, white— or a  myriad of other colors that didn’t have names or descriptions— it  was almost like a Rorschach test, whatever you wanted it to be at  whatever time, but never really anything: a design of a Craft wrought  long, long ago. His solemn reddish-pink face was easily human enough,  though his ears were triangular, cloven in two to form a “Y”, and  his nose was long, pointed, and it slanted down, so it looked more  like an eagle’s beak. He had a small pointed silvery-grey beard,  flowing hair, and a cap the same color as his robe. The man was  enormous, well over two meters, and his eyes flashed with a charity  that might be confused with animal ferocity. To his right (Amy’s  left) was a deep chasm that led to further levels down, all the way  to the world’s center; to his right was a grove, and out from that  grove sprang a tree that was more real than anything Amy had yet  seen.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, only took a few seconds to  observe, and when it was over, the Pendragon spoke: “The one  thousand and ninety-five days of Tellus have passed, and the Silent  Planet has performed three revolutions around her center Arbol,  blessed life-giver and protector, just as I have decreed. And here  you stand before me once again, Mirari, in defiance of the odds, a  living homage to your wondrous name. When last we met, words were  exchanged and instructions were given, and I had contempt for your  ways, but now I welcome you, dear successor, and dearer for the honor  you have which no one else may claim. Tell me, Mirari, do you believe  yourself close to accomplishing that which I, acting on behalf of  powers greater than my own, set you out to achieve?”</p>
<p>“I do, Lord Pendragon,” she replied with a bow. “I  have gathered acquaintances to help in my endeavors, and I believe I  have penetrated a number of their hearts. It has been the most  difficult thing I ever did, and subsequently, the most rewarding. We  have also acquired many of the tools necessary to combat our common  enemy.”</p>
<p>“But certainly, by no means, do you have them all,”  he said, a look of disquieting humor in his eyes. Amy shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, Lord. I beg your pardon, but for what purpose  was I instructed to return here, three years ago? What good might you  do for me?”</p>
<p>“A sufficient amount, I believe, if I do not perform  too little. My Arts alone are insufficient weapons against the  Origin. Yet fear not; we have time yet, as long as your journey  remains incomplete. Do we not?” His eyes became even sharper, and  though he did not smile, he certainly seemed pleased at some dark  joke in the back of his mind.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she whispered. “But again, Lord, I ask  you: what good will you do for us?” The Pendragon did not answer at  first. Instead, he stretched his hand out, towards the tree that had  amazed Amy, and carefully pinched off the tiniest twig, whispering  something to heal its new wound. The twig began to grow almost  immediately, slowly turning into a stick and then into a small  branch, until it was as tall as the Pendragon himself, nearly a tree  in its own right, and in bloom, too. It seemed like the perfect staff  for a Wizard such as himself.</p>
<p>“I?” he said, his voice deep and penetrating. “I  will accompany you. It has been foretold that my successor walks with  you, she who will continue this holy office. I mean to do some small  good for your company before I pass this mantle and retire from this  world.” Amy was overjoyed; she didn’t expect that degree of  assistance. However, she was a little concerned for her crew. She had  no doubt they would not get along with their new companion.</p>
<p>“A word, Lord Pendragon,” she said as they returned  to the surface. “You may want to exercise discretion and prudence  once we leave the sphere of Perelandra. The world has changed much  since your departure.”</p>
<p>“No, I do not believe it has,” he stated, stepping  out into the golden sunlight. He glanced at Amy, peering past all of  her crude matter into the eternal glory of mind and soul, and clasped  the head of his living staff. “It has not changed, Mirari. Not what  you would call <em>changed</em>.”</p>

<p>Amy didn’t know it, but she spent days wrapped under  the Pendragon’s song-spell, never even realizing it. During her  lengthy absence, the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> experienced two  very startling sensations and one rather mundane one. First, they  began to worry about their companion, and a few wondered if they  should go out to find her, but they reasoned it would be completely  impossible, given the terrain, and that Amy would probably go looking  for them whenever she was ready to leave. Second, they met a native—  only one, a man, too heartbreaking and noble to describe. Even  Chandra was reduced to tears as she felt an unusual longing for him—  not merely sexual, but spiritual as well. Sharyn was the most  affected, however, for she thought she was kin to them. He had green  skin and a wholesome sense of naïveté that can be found in certain  animals— not an ignorance but pure innocence, a literal sinless  soul.</p>
<p>The third sensation, and by far the most jarring, was  the spell the planet had been weaving over them. Ever since their  arrival, the women had felt a strong libido building up within them.  This was not the crude, indiscriminate frivolity Chandra expressed,  nor even the loving sensuality that a number of them were accustomed  to. This was Venus descended to drive the world mad, an animal thirst  and an angelic hunger to know one another in perfect intimacy, love  in its barest form (or close enough). They say “to drive mad”  because it only seemed indiscriminate. Those already in love felt it  first: Fuuka and Athena, Kate and Allegra, Yenae and Alala, Sharyn  and Lyara…</p>
<p>“It’s strange,” Allegra said, “but it doesn’t  feel wrong or unnatural at all. It feels like something that’s  always been there, and we’ve either ignored it or taken too little  of it. Katherine, what do you think?”</p>
<p>“I think we should try and be as private as lovers,”  she replied, smiling beautifully. She took Allegra by the hand and  they found a fish to ride on; together they made it to the ship,  chose a room, and consummated their union. Others weren’t quite as  patient: Athena tackled Fuuka and nearly made love to her in front of  everybody, and only managed to hold herself off long enough to find a  secluded spot. Lyara and Sharyn followed Kate’s example, obviously,  but Lillianne and Aseria, both baffled by the feelings bombarding  them, headed inland. Even the twins succumbed to Venus’s spell as  Kyrie and Valti fought over them.</p>
<p>“Teleah’s my kind of girl! Kayleigh’s more your  style anyway!”</p>
<p>“I saw them first! I’m not sharing them with you,  you know!”</p>
<p>“This is either the worst day of our life, or the  best,” Kay sighed to her sister. Teleah smiled.</p>
<p>“Let’s make it our best and find a room. Did  somebody say ‘foursome’?”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be a threesome?” Herut muttered.  Shana was cuddling especially close to her, though, and lately her  resistance had been fading. Alala and Yenae took one look at each  other, silently deciding to keep the promise they made earlier, and  ran for the shore.</p>
<p>“This is getting indecent,” Eve complained. Mink  laughed quietly.</p>
<p>“But <em>decent</em> is exactly what it’s becoming.  Even I feel it.” Kasberry smiled softly at the taller woman and  leaned her head against her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Yeah, me too. I guess being sentimental once in  awhile won’t hurt.”</p>
<p>“No, it won’t.” Mink leaned over and kissed Eve;  I’m not at liberty to discuss what happened after. It seemed that  everyone was falling under Venus’s spell, except for Vimmy, who had  already returned to the ship, muttering about how unworthy she was of  remaining there, and Chandra, who also went back alone. Eventually,  everyone decided to return to the ship, whether to make love or just  to prepare themselves for liftoff. They each sensed that it was  almost time for them to leave, even though they still hadn’t heard  from Amy. It was just a feeling they had, like intuition: Miracle  would be returning any minute now. Rebecca and Riene were the last to  board the ship, but only because Latoli still had a fear of drowning,  even after everything she had seen. The spell of Venus was hitting  them the hardest, and being naked in each other’s company was  practically an invitation. The decision was up to them now.</p>
<p>“That was quite an adventure, wasn’t it?” Riene  said at last, smiling feebly. She mentally kicked herself for  trivializing such an important event; she may as well say that birth  or marriage or graduation was as important as getting the mail. “I’m  sorry I doubted you,” she remedied, giving Rebecca an honest smile.  At least she was brave enough now to look her in the eye.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be,” she replied warmly. “It  did sound like a crazy idea. Anyway, I’m glad you came. This is one  of those things we’ll look back on fondly.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. Um, Becky…” Riene didn’t know how to  respond to the magic circulating around her, because she had never  really been in love before, not to this degree, and it was a little  frightening. But she also knew she wanted this, more than anything,  and if the entire planet was behind her as support, how could she go  wrong? She was sure that Rebecca wanted this, too. Why else come to  her, of all people, after her tribulation with her father? She wanted  to throw away her questions and inhibitions for once and take that  plunge, even if she hit rock bottom. Surely the brief flight would be  worth all her troubles.</p>
<p>“Yes…Riene?” Rebecca whispered. Her mouth opened  partially as the two women drew closer. Their eyes met and the warmth  from their bare bodies rose and splashed. They felt cool skin as they  touched each other’s shoulders— then lowered their hands to the  waist. How strong Riene felt, how graceful Rebecca was! They  instantly knew that they were meant for each other as they leaned  closer still, hearts pounding in their bodies, the entire world  cheering for them as their lips came within a hair’s breadth of  each other, a fleeting touch…</p>
<p>“Honey, I’m home!!”</p>
<p>And just like that, the spell was broken. They parted  from each other, flustered and fumbling, as Amy Miracle stood in the  doorway with the Pendragon in tow.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Once everyone got dressed and came to their senses,  Teleah and Kayleigh Acheron returned to the bridge, feeling numb all  over from their experiences— both past and recent. They still had  the stink of two lovers around them, even after showering, but they  certainly felt no shame for their actions, although they wished, not  for the first time, that they were two people with their own body  instead of sharing just one. They dutifully lifted the <em>Dauntless </em>from Venus’s clutches and steered her away, back into the cold,  numbing humility of space. Amy Miracle joined them shortly,  disheveled and dowdy as ever.</p>
<p>“Well, Doctor, what’s our next destination?” they  asked her. Miracle took a deep breath and shook her head.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I don’t know.”</p>
