<h1>All Girls School (part 91 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch90.html">Back to Part 90</a><pre>&quot;Broken Flowers&quot;

Mirrors are flat, mirrors are cold, mirrors are cruel&#151;they only show the 
truth. They cannot discriminate, nor can they flatter or worsen the 
view. They simply show what is. To break one is not to incur seven years 
of wrath, but to break the truth itself. To look into one is not to see 
deep levels or deep truths, but merely to see that which is seeing, to 
view what is viewing, to know that there is somebody else there. A 
mirror has no value without a viewer...but will a viewer have value 
without a mirror?

They are cold and cruel and flat, and they speak no lies, nor do their 
eyes gaze perversely. They simply see all&#151;that is, whatever the viewer 
is seeing. They are deadly and silent, they reflect, but very seldom are 
they reflected upon. Love is no mirror, for it is wavy; its shape 
changes like the shape of clouds. Love can be hot with passion, generous 
with care, selfless and deceitful. When two lovers stand before it 
naked, arms and hands wound around one another&#39;s bodies (should they 
decide to avert their gaze and observe what they look like while in the 
throws of passion), they can deceive themselves, but the mirror carries 
with it no such thing. It only carries the truth, and the truth was...

&quot;We look pretty hot,&quot; observed Alisha, grinning at herself and her 
sister in the mirror. Erica had to admit, her sister was right. But she 
didn&#39;t look for a long time; her gaze was focused on her sibling, away 
from the mirror. Their foreplay lasted until they believed the water was 
warm enough. They were going to shower together.

&quot;You know, it&#39;s odd we started this whole thing by looking in a mirror.&quot; 
Steam, water, skin, lotion: an equation for a forbidden tryst of 
siblings. Erica&#39;s hands burned with pleasure as they caressed her older 
sister&#39;s wet breasts, and she carefully traced her own fingers over 
those nipples of hers, shocked and amazed that she was actually doing 
it. The young woman was throttled by lust. She wanted her sister.

&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; she asked. Then Alisha, and back again, like a tennis 
match.

&quot;You looked like you were...reflecting on something.&quot; Erica snorted at 
the pun, but the look in her sibling&#39;s face was serious. She had meant 
to use that choice of words, yes, but meant it without her usual humor. 
In other words, there was something on their minds.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she answered, touching the older girl&#39;s chest with lighter 
pressure, &quot;I was. I&#39;m thinking about a lot. It&#39;s difficult to sort 
things out, even in a quiet moment. Your body is distracting me...&quot; She 
came very close and put her naked skin next to her sister&#39;s, needing the 
contact like she needed food and water. Her hands felt along the older 
girl&#39;s waist, tickling her hips&#151;she wanted to penetrate her sister, to 
slowly fuck her with beautiful sweetness, to get her to climax once or 
twice, until she yelled out Erica, Erica, having no control over her own 
voice.

&quot;I don&#39;t mean it, babe,&quot; said Alisha, humorously. She held her sister 
and patiently waited for her fingers to work their magic. &quot;Ugh. Slower 
please. I&#39;ve got some things on my mind too. Have you noticed Chef Vee 
lately?&quot;

&quot;You mean Miss Verala?&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; she sighed, somehow managing to stand in spite of the probing. 
Her sister was...blinding her. The passionate rage was deadly. &quot;She 
doesn&#39;t...look herself. I tried...talking to her... She just gave me a 
fake smile and...the usual Thursday slop. You think she had a nervous 
breakdown?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s too young to be facing a midlife crisis. What 
about...heartbreak?&quot; A hiss, plus a gasp. Oh!! Erica had...

&quot;UUUGGHHHK!!!&quot;

&quot;Heartbreak can shatter even the most wonderful resolve.&quot;

&quot;AAH! ERR...I...CAAAA...&quot;

&quot;It damns us, like a chain, dragging us into some dark pit with no way 
out.&quot;

&quot;Uh...uh...uh...Erica... F...f-fuck meee...!&quot;

&quot;It tears us apart at a level science and medicine does not understand. 
It leaves us for dead.&quot;

&quot;Yes-yes-yes-yeaaaaaAAAAAHHHH!!!!!&quot; Silence. Only the water, and Erica&#39;s 
words, existed.

&quot;Judging upon that, it&#39;s no wonder people say that love hurts. Maybe I 
shouldn&#39;t love you then.&quot; Alisha looked down as her sister knelt, 
kissing her taut tummy before developing further, towards the patch of 
dark-red fur governing her sex. The elder Fox swallowed, shivering. What 
was going to happen?

&quot;Ricki...?&quot; Erica looked up and smiled sweetly.

&quot;You know I&#39;m only kidding. Love is only that potent because it&#39;s the 
most powerful thing in the world. Don&#39;t worry, I love you in the good 
sense.&quot; As if to prove it, she willingly buried her face in her own 
sister&#39;s crotch, giving her great oral pleasure for slow, seething 
moments. Alisha felt like fainting.
Chef Sonia Verela

Speed&#151;the heart breaks at a great speed, especially one so na&iuml;ve to the 
pain of love&#39;s bitter half. Sonia Verela had given her heart totally to 
Bernadette Marbel, in spite of their age and occupational differences. 
She would&#39;ve been the older woman&#39;s lover for all her life...but guilt 
was a terrible choking chain, wrapped so deep around lady Marbel&#39;s neck 
that the only way to get it off would be to admit everything. She loved 
Sonia, but that love could never be. She was meant for her Joanna, her 
wife and longtime lover, and Sonia, delicate and kind, did not deserve 
to be shared.

Figuratively speaking, it was like Bernadette had shot an arrow in 
Sonia&#39;s chest. First she drew back&#151;&quot;Sonia, I have a confession&quot;&#151;and 
barely waited for enough time to aim before she let the missile fly. Now 
a mirror may only shatter when one wishes to destroy the truth, but a 
heart can shatter because of the truth, so its destruction is far easier 
and more gruesome. Sonia felt her world turn to ruin as she heard the 
truth from her lover&#39;s lips&#151;and then she slapped her lover, so fierce 
and strong that her hand burned, and Marbel&#39;s face turned dark red.

&quot;MONSTER!!&quot; she called her, yelling at the top of her lungs. She 
wept&#151;&quot;LIAR!!&quot;&#151;and screamed, and might have actually beaten the older 
woman with her bare hands. She was too angry to fight, so she just 
slapped, striking the woman she had admired again and again, calling her 
names that no person, no matter what sin they had committed, should be 
called. Bernadette let the young woman do as she pleased, and offered no 
words in her defense, not even an apology. What good would it do? Sonia 
had honestly loved her, and now, she was destroyed.

That was the reason why she was now so despondent, and for better or 
worse, neither of the Fox sisters would learn the truth.
Fox Sister&#39;s Bedroom

Gone was the foreplay; Alisha and Erica were having sex, and that was 
that. They had moved from the bathroom shortly after drying each other 
off and scampered, quite naked, to their room. Erica squealed wildly as 
she and her sister tumbled onto the mattress and sheets, only their bare 
skin covering them, and wrestled and played until sex stormed in and 
took over their minds. Alisha wanted to drive her sister wild as payment 
for the awesome oral sex in the shower (among other things), and to say 
she fucked the young lady&#39;s brains out was like saying space was big.

Eventually the fiends stopped and caught their breath. In the back of 
their minds, they knew what they were doing was wrong, but it was like a 
drug, addictive and potentially lethal. It was one thing for the two of 
them to know, but if chance their parents or friends figured out... It 
couldn&#39;t go on for long. They both knew that, even Alisha. She had hoped 
to live the rest of her years as a lover to her beautiful little sister, 
but this was clearly impossible. Besides, Erica still stared at Jocelyn 
longingly, and Alisha...

&quot;Miss Madsen and Miss Keeping aren&#39;t seeing each other now,&quot; she said 
idly. Erica looked down at her sister, naked and angelic.

&quot;Oh? Why not?&quot;

&quot;Who knows? I just know that because I saw them with other women.&quot;

&quot;So? Maybe they&#39;re just friends.&quot;

&quot;Sneaking off into the bathroom together for long periods of time?&quot;

&quot;...Oh.&quot;
Stanton Teacher&#39;s Lounge

&quot;May I sit here?&quot; Abigail Keeping looked up and noticed her former lover 
standing there. She scooted over to make room.

&quot;Sure, sure, be my guest. But this isn&#39;t your lunch hour, is it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the only time of day I can talk to you, and we need to talk.&quot; Abby 
nodded her head thoughtfully.

&quot;Yes, we do. Would you like to start?&quot;

&quot;I would.&quot; A pause. Hitomi played with her food idly. Abby was patiently 
silent. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I blew up at you the other day, when you suggested we 
should see other people. I just thought...you didn&#39;t love me anymore, 
and had found someone else. I know now that this isn&#39;t true. I still 
want to believe that we have a future together.&quot;

&quot;But...?&quot; Hitomi grinned.

&quot;I, uh, met someone. We&#39;re dating now.&quot;

&quot;Really. And what&#39;s he like?&quot;

&quot;She is quite nice, thank you.&quot; Abby chuckled.

&quot;You are such a lesbian.&quot;

&quot;Oh stop it, you&#39;re no better than I am.&quot;

&quot;As a matter of fact,&quot; she said coyly, &quot;I am no better. I&#39;m seeing a 
lovely young lady right now, or did I tell you that?&quot;

&quot;No, this is news to me.&quot; Hitomi smiled, wanting to show her former 
lover that she no longer carried any hostility towards her. &quot;So are you 
two...happy?&quot;

&quot;Hmm, yes, a bit. We&#39;ve not dated much, but she is a very sweet woman. 
What about yours?&quot;

&quot;An interesting case,&quot; replied Madsen mysteriously.

&quot;Oh? Anyone I know?&quot; A nod.

&quot;Sammy, to be exact. From here.&quot; Abby&#39;s eyes widened.

&quot;Samantha O&#39;Brien?! You mean that goofy Latin teacher who looks like a 
gypsy fortune teller?&quot;

&quot;Yes, her, though please don&#39;t call her goofy. She&#39;s really another 
person when she&#39;s not in school&#151;very humorous and enjoyable. I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;ve ever laughed so much in my life.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so she&#39;s jolly.&quot; Then a whisper, one conspirator to another: &quot;(So, 
is it true she doesn&#39;t shave her legs or armpits?)&quot;

&quot;Abigail!! Really!&quot;

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s just something I heard.&quot; A pause. Hitomi sighed.

&quot;I talked to her about it. She just says, &#145;Why bother? Nobody cares 
anyway.&#39; After I...proved her wrong, she got straight to work. Now she 
looks rather lovely.&quot;

&quot;Does she now.&quot; Hitomi smiled. She wouldn&#39;t dare say anything else, not 
unless Abby showed a few of her own cards. When prodded, Keeping just 
curled her lips and calmly stated, &quot;Oh, you know, she&#39;s a woman 
enthralled with history. Quite a sexiful character. The girl&#39;s poor as a 
monk due to her habit, but at least it doesn&#39;t affect her physical 
health like your smoking did.&quot; Hitomi gave her ex-lover a dirty look for 
that last remark, but let it slide. After all, she knew who Abby was 
dating.

&quot;It&#39;s Janna Raulson, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;I guess reading all that Agatha Christie really pays off.&quot; Hitomi 
grinned and laughed quietly&#151;not at Abby&#39;s choice in women, but the sheer 
weirdness of it all. &quot;Well,&quot; said Keeping once she was filled in on the 
joke, &quot;at least we&#39;re acting civil to each other again. I&#39;m glad of 
that.&quot;

&quot;Yes indeed. Oh, I guess I should come clean and say that I slept with 
dear Janna once, a few days ago. Don&#39;t worry, her garden&#39;s still got 
plenty of, uh...flowers to it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m flattered,&quot; Abby said coyly. She and Madsen smiled&#151;apparently they 
were both now okay with each other having a new girlfriend. But other 
people...
Elspeth Post&#39;s Drama Class

While Rozalia and Mira were busy trading barbs and, on occasion, 
actually performing according to script, Hero couldn&#39;t help but eye 
Ayanna, her former love interest. Sure they had split due to Hero&#39;s 
obedience to her religion, but somehow that didn&#39;t stop the young woman 
from thinking about her ex. She found herself wrestling with conflict 
again, as if it were an angel encountering her in the desert, soon to 
brand her &quot;Israel&quot;, my struggle. And struggle she did indeed: despite 
what she said, Hero could not totally part with her feelings.

I have to be honest with myself, she reasoned. As devoted as I am, or 
rather I&#39;d like to be, I just can&#39;t forget about her. What should I do? 
I still love her! I still want to be her girlfriend! Is there some 
problem with me, or is this what God really wants? I wish I knew more 
about homosexuality, like why I&#39;m attracted to her even though I know 
it&#39;s wrong. I don&#39;t get it. Am I struggling with a temptation or just 
denying myself a happiness? Is this truly God&#39;s will? I wish I could 
talk to somebody about this.

&quot;Hero, you idiot,&quot; she murmured to herself, &quot;of course there&#39;s a person 
you can talk to about this. Don&#39;t be so stupid.&quot; She took a deep breath, 
looked up into the rafters, and nodded to herself.

She approached Ayanna.

&quot;Hey.&quot;

&quot;Oh, hey Hero. How&#39;re you doing?&quot;

&quot;Uh, can we talk? In private?&quot;

&quot;Sure, I guess.&quot; Ayanna walked away&#151;she really didn&#39;t have anything to 
do for awhile. Rozalia saw them go, and kept peeking even though she was 
in a scene. She didn&#39;t hear their conversation, not that she needed to. 
The two former lovers&#151;the &quot;fairy set&quot;, people had once called them&#151;were 
now in a world all their own.

But how can one sew up the fabric of a jagged relationship, especially 
if they were the one that had ripped it apart?

&quot;So what&#39;s this about?&quot; Ayanna asked. It was a good way to start things 
off.

&quot;Uh, listen...I know we&#39;ve got something going on here in class, so I&#39;ll 
make this short. I&#39;m having...second thoughts about breaking up with 
you.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Really.&quot; Ayanna crossed her arms. Not necessarily a good sign.

&quot;Yeah... I&#39;m really confused. I still care for you...I&#39;m 
still...attracted to you, and I know I shouldn&#39;t be.&quot;

&quot;So what do you want me to do?&quot;

&quot;Just listen, all right? I&#39;m not exactly going through a stable period 
right now. I mean, I wanna follow God, but I just don&#39;t...want to 
abandon you. I wish there was some way we could be a couple and 
still...&quot;

&quot;Look, I don&#39;t know what you want,&quot; she told Hero. &quot;What you&#39;re 
saying... It&#39;s one of the reasons I never fell for that Christian stuff. 
They&#39;re not too keen on homosexuality, and that&#39;s part of who I am. I 
know you accept me for that; you just don&#39;t want to accept yourself as 
that. Look...I don&#39;t think we can get back together, if that&#39;s what 
you&#39;re saying. I&#39;ve got a girlfriend, and...well, she&#39;s not...like that. 
I mean, it&#39;s not like you stuffed religion into my face every day or 
anything, it&#39;s just that... She&#39;s not really...concerned about that.&quot;

&quot;...Ah. A girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, a cheerleader, name&#39;s Orlha. She&#39;s nice.&quot; Hero had never heard of 
her. Maybe Yuki would know. She hung her head, feeling disappointed.

&quot;Well, uh, y&#39;know, it&#39;s your decision. I just wanted to say...I miss 
you, and this is a really trying time in my life. I&#39;m pulled in like 
seventeen different directions.&quot; Ayanna could tell that Hero needed her 
attention and love, and even though she was confident that they would 
not get back into a relationship, she wanted to at least show her some 
affection. She drew her ex-girlfriend into a hug, which was happily 
returned. She even kissed her, on the cheek, just faintly.

&quot;OH, GET A ROOM, YOU TWO!!!&quot; The girls jerked around and saw Rozalia 
glaring at them. They retorted with a weird look, and retreated 
elsewhere. For Hero, it was back to her mental and spiritual war with 
herself; for Ayanna, her sexy new girlfriend awaited. Something told 
her, though, that this was not the last of the matter.
Fox Sister&#39;s Bedroom

Their sexual edge dulled at last, the Fox sisters dressed. Ironically, 
they both agreed to go on a double-date with two other people...and they 
would switch dates as soon as they got there. It all started, 
unbelievably, by a suggestion from Alisha. She wanted to go out, maybe 
to a nice restaurant or have a picnic if the weather improved, and 
suggested that Gabrielle and Olivia go with them. Why?

&quot;I just thought of them, that&#39;s all,&quot; she said in response to Erica&#39;s 
inquiry. The younger Fox sister smiled.

&quot;You know, I kinda have a crush on Gabrielle anyway. I hear she&#39;s single 
now that she and Lilian split. Maybe we could...start something 
together.&quot;

&quot;Here&#39;s hoping,&quot; replied her sister. &quot;As for me, I&#39;m gonna go after that 
foxy goddess Olivia. God, she&#39;s hot! I have no idea why a woman like her 
wouldn&#39;t have a girlfriend, unless she&#39;s straight. But that doesn&#39;t 
explain the lack of a boyfriend. I mean, a person would have to be crazy 
to pass her up!&quot;

&quot;You think they&#39;d really like to go on a double date? Hey, don&#39;t forget 
the last time we did something like this. Amina and I didn&#39;t hit it off 
at all, and all the while you and Nomi were giving each other tonsil 
inspections.&quot;

&quot;Hey, what can I say, I charm easily. And you know, I bet it won&#39;t 
happen again. Five dollars says that Gabrielle&#39;s all over you come the 
end of the date.&quot; Erica blushed faintly, shoved her sister with gentle 
care, and put the finishing touches on her hair. To be honest, she had 
not been on a &quot;real&quot; date ever since the day she realized she was gay. 
Oh sure, there was Amina, Jocelyn, and her sister, but none of those 
really counted. Amina was straight (although now she had doubts). 
Jocelyn was her best friend (though they had been lovers for awhile). 
And Alisha was her sister.

Oh yeah, my grandkids are gonna give me strange looks, she thought. 
...Uh, that is, if I do have grandkids. ...Heh...

The Fox sisters had no idea that Gabrielle and Olivia were playacting as 
lovers.

Gabrielle and Olivia had no idea the Fox sisters were involved with each 
other.

The double-date was scheduled, set, and ready to go.

......

&quot;You sure about this?&quot;

&quot;Sure I&#39;m sure!&quot; replied Olivia, smiling brightly. &quot;You need to get out 
more, and I need...also...to get out more.&quot; She grinned and nudged her 
friend. &quot;And hey, if this doesn&#39;t work out, we still have each other to 
fall back on.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. Reliable Livvie...&quot; The girls smiled and exchanged 
a kiss, just in time to hear Alisha whistling lewdly. Their dates had 
apparently practiced their entrances before, or else this was simply one 
of their better ones. Alisha immediately gravitated towards Olivia, 
talking and smiling and flirting shamelessly. Gabrielle felt like a 
ghost as her best friend and lover was taken away, and only noticed 
Erica when she turned around and realized a pretty girl was standing 
there, all alone.

&quot;So, uh...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, um...&quot;

&quot;Ya wanna...come sit with me?&quot;

&quot;Sure, it&#39;d be great.&quot; They smiled, but didn&#39;t take hands. Olivia had 
her fingers locked with Alisha&#39;s already, and looked like she was having 
a great time. Although this was not some great big scheme of Alisha Fox, 
she had unknowingly dated the person that was just about perfect for 
her. Olivia was everything she was looking for in a lover: serious, 
generous, eloquent, polite, basically an all-around &quot;good&quot; girl who was 
unquestionably beautiful. And Olivia was in a good position too: Alisha 
was plainly aggressive and just a little bit wild, plus she was 
talkative, attentive, and a redhead at heart, just her type.

Dinner was hardly the main attraction. Alisha and Olivia stole the show, 
engaging in conversations so full of life and vibrancy that even &quot;Gabby&quot; 
O&#39;Shannon found herself tongue-tied. Now Erica was quiet by nature, but 
to hear silence from Gabrielle&#39;s mouth was downright disturbing. And yet 
Fox the elder and Johnson continued, becoming so absorbed with each 
other that they barely paid attention to the food, much less their 
counterparts.

&quot;I guess they clicked,&quot; Gabrielle muttered to her date.

&quot;Yeah. So, uh, I hear you and Lilian were an item.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; The Irish girl sighed with deep nostalgia, the kind only a 
forlorn lover would emit. She snapped out of her reverie and noted, &quot;I 
hear you and Jocelyn McKeough were together too. What happened to that? 
Ya looked like a cute couple!&quot;

&quot;She...said it wasn&#39;t working out. A best friends sort of deal.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I dunno, best friends often make the best lovers.&quot; She smiled and 
looked at Olivia, but the dark-skinned girl hadn&#39;t heard a word. She was 
too drawn to Alisha, that wild and crazy girl with a heart of...well, 
maybe not gold, but definitely some valuable metal. Gabrielle tilted her 
head and drained her Sprite.

&quot;Something on your mind?&quot; asked Erica.

&quot;Meh. Lotsa things. I&#39;m sorry, me heart&#39;s not into this date.&quot;

&quot;...Mine also,&quot; Erica admitted. &quot;I mean, no offense, I have a crush on 
you, but somehow I don&#39;t feel like being...romantic. I&#39;m not sure if 
we&#39;ll click.&quot;

&quot;Yah...&quot; Gabrielle grinned, which always made any situation better, and 
decided to keep the rest of her opinions to herself as she let her best 
friend and her date&#39;s sister go at it. They only really stopped once the 
check came, which was split into four. Time had went too quick for 
Alisha and Olivia (&quot;More like &#145;Olishia&#39;,&quot; Gabrielle had remarked), too 
slow for the others. Gabrielle felt like going home, curling up in her 
bed, and remaining motionless for days, like a baby refusing to leave 
its womb. Maybe she was just a coward, afraid to keep her hands on a 
woman she loved&#151;or somebody that loved her. It was just like with 
Lilian, a girl so right for her and yet she gave her away without a 
fight.

God, I&#39;m so stupid...

Erica was the last to leave the restaurant. Olivia was taking Alisha to 
her house for awhile&#151;for what ends nobody wanted to know&#151;and so their 
respective dates would be left to their own affairs. Alisha was honestly 
hoping that her sister would get the idea and follow Gabrielle home for 
&quot;a similar night of extended romance&quot;, but the idea was far out of 
Erica&#39;s mind. She just wanted to go home. First Amina, then Jocelyn, now 
her own sister. She felt like she was cursed.

It won&#39;t happen again, eh? Five dollars says that Gabrielle&#39;s all over 
me come the end of the date, huh? Well you better pay up, sister! (Sigh) 
I&#39;m such a moron. God, why am I even moping? I should just give up and 
concentrate on my studies. Hopefully I can go the rest of the school 
year without feeling sick every time I see two girls displaying 
affection!

Gabrielle was kind enough to drive Erica home. They did decide to share 
a goodnight kiss, but felt no chemistry at all. &quot;I guess we didn&#39;t click 
after all,&quot; Erica had said sheepishly. Gabrielle admitted she was right, 
and said maybe it was best that they be friends. Friends. Oh, you&#39;re 
just a friend to me, Erica. You&#39;re just a friend. Um...it&#39;s nice that 
you like me like that, but I think maybe we should just be friends. Just 
be friends. Just friends, Erica. That&#39;s all.

&quot;Night.&quot;

&quot;Night.&quot; Gabrielle went inside and strolled up to her room. Mother and 
Father were in their room watching TV; she made as little noise as 
possible as she closed her door, locked it, and fell on her bed, utterly 
drained of...well, everything. Everything that defined her was gone. 
Misery didn&#39;t suit her, not even at her worst moments, but exceptions 
could always be made.

As if God in Heaven was answering her sorrow, her cell phone rang. She 
answered it.

&quot;Hello?&quot; A pause. &quot;......Lilian?&quot;</pre>
