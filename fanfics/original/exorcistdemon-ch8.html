<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>      When Abby opened the door later that night and saw Seth standing there with some 
luggage, she surprised him by saying, &quot;Finally, there&#39;s a man here. We can actually get some 
testosterone in this house.&quot; He walked inside awkwardly. &quot;A lot of things have happened in 
the last few hours; don&#39;t ask; I&#39;m sure Krystal will tell you all about it.&quot;

      Abby handed him the key and shoved him down the hall to find his girlfriend&#39;s room. He 
just figured that he wouldn&#39;t question the woman and just ask Krystal himself. His 
girlfriend had quickly told him what had happened. All Seth got out of the conversation was 
a) something to do with lesbian schoolgirls and b) the demon was a small child. He was 
pretty sure he misheard that part...

      Seth finally came upon the correct door and used the key on it. With his luck, he&#39;d 
likely enter into a stereotypical awkward situation that had to do with lesbianism and his 
girlfriend. He braced himself for it as he opened the door and-

      Well, Krystal looked up from the book she was reading and smiled at him. He let out a 
sigh of relief as she came over and gave him a nice, big hug. &quot;Seth! I&#39;m so happy you could 
make it.&quot; He smiled and gave her a sweet little kiss. &quot;Of course... except that was the 
weirdest phone call I&#39;ve ever had.&quot;

      She blushed and put a hand over her mouth. &quot;Well, I already told you about the two 
friends,&quot; he just nodded as she continued. &quot;...but the demon followed me back to my 
apartment to... uh, attack me...&quot; She blushed and he had to stifle a laugh.

      &quot;I sure hope you took care of the demon... I don&#39;t want to share my girlfriend.&quot; 
Krystal just laughed and led him by the hand to where Isaka was asleep. As a five year old, 
Isaka found herself to be much more tired than normal. How did little kids get so much 
energy? She wasn&#39;t quite sure, for she was exhausted in her tiny body. At least she had 
succeeded in getting Eveon and Mina together... definite plus.

      Of course, she had come up with the perfect plan to escape the soul prison... Isaka 
just needed to get away from Krystal to enact it. Right now, she was having a vivid dream 
of... well, something a little too racy and superfluous. That is... until she was woken up 
by soft warm hands stroking her hair and shaking her head.

      Isaka leaned into the warm touch, reveling in Krystal&#39;s gentleness. Of course, her 
eyes snapped open when she heard a man&#39;s voice. &quot;Yeah, she sure is cute for a demon out to 
ravage virgins...!&quot; Seth kept running his hands through her long brown hair and Krystal just 
laughed. &quot;I know; the soul prison has never done this before...&quot;

      Seth wasn&#39;t an exorcist like his girlfriend, but he did have a few chance encounters 
with some of the demons. He had finally got a license for a gun a while back and had to use 
it on a particularly bad demon. He had seen her use the soul prison before and most of the 
demons transformed into mini monsters, but not this one... at least he didn&#39;t consider Isaka 
a mini monster until a searing pain went through his hand.

      &quot;AAAAAAAGGGGHHHHHH!!!!&quot; Seth let out a scream (a manly one) as Isaka bit down on one 
of his hands. Krystal let out a shriek and tried to pry the little demon off of his hand. 
However, her vicious fangs dug into his flesh and she refused to let go. The demon was so 
infuriated that this... this... boy... would come to take away her Krystal.

      The exorcist tried to pull on her jaw and lift up her head, but nothing was working. 
She finally became alarmed as blood started to pool out of her mouth. Krystal concentrated 
some holy energy in her hand and delivered to Isaka something akin to a taser.

      The mini demon let out a yelp and released Seth&#39;s poor mangled hand from her vicious 
mouth of doom. &quot;Damn it!&quot; He hissed out and cradled it to his chest. &quot;Oh my God... Isaka! 
How could you do that?&quot; The exorcist didn&#39;t wait for a reply from the demon and instead 
dragged her boyfriend off to the bathroom.

      Isaka pouted and wiped the blood off of her mouth. That would show him... 
unfortunately it seemed like Krystal was pissed off at her. Then again, she did try to 
permanently disable her boyfriend... 

***** 

      After going on a frantic search for a first aid kit and discovering that Abby was a 
registered nurse, Krystal was pooped. Abby had disinfected, bandaged and provided pills for 
Seth&#39;s injury. He was embarrassed to have been nearly killed by a five year old, demon or 
not. &quot;Well, at least you don&#39;t have to worry about me being tempted. Can&#39;t do much with 
this,&quot; He waved his bandaged hand back and forth and they both laughed.

      It was an inside joke for them to make up excuses to not have sex, since Krystal 
practiced abstinence. Some would think that Seth lived a tough life because of it, but he 
loved his girlfriend. &quot;...and no special time for me in the bathroom later.&quot; She threw a 
pillow at him and they burst out in laughter again.

      It was at this time that Krystal noticed Isaka was no where to be found. She looked 
around the room twice, checked the bathroom and even looked in the closet. She let out an 
exasperated sigh and collapsed on the bed next to Seth. &quot;I can&#39;t find Isaka, but I&#39;ll worry 
about it tomorrow...&quot; Seth nodded in agreement and turned off the light.

      They huddled together and soon fell asleep. 

***** 

      When Mina awoke the next morning, she woke up rather disorientated and confused. The 
reason... well, where was Eveon? Her own question was answered as a wonderful smell wafted 
through the vent. She lazily stumbled out of bed and eyed the clock. It was 7 a.m. Mina 
continued her journey to find Eveon and her ears registered the sound of sizzling. Her 
stomach growled.

      When Mina finally entered the kitchen, she was greeted by the sight of Eveon already 
dressed, her hair up in a ponytail. She was working religiously on an omelet and barely 
noticed Mina&#39;s presence. When she did notice her out of the corner of her eye, she jumped a 
bit. &quot;Mina! I didn&#39;t see you there...&quot; Eveon rubbed her head awkwardly because she was sure 
that was obvious.

      The other girl just laughed and sat down at the table as Eveon finished cooking. &quot;You 
may be really good at baking, Mina, but you&#39;ll never be able to master my cooking,&quot; said 
Eveon as she set down the plate and a glass of orange juice in front of Mina. She took off 
her apron and hung it up on the hook on the pantry before sitting down next to Mina to enjoy 
her omelet. Mina hungrily dug in and giggled happily at the taste.

      &quot;You rock at cooking,&quot; she said as she laid her head on Eveon&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Why did you 
get up so early? It&#39;s Sunday morning.&quot;

      Eveon just blushed and started eating. &quot;...well, you bake me stuff all the time so...&quot; 
They continued eating in comfortable silence, until they felt like they were being watched. 
They turned around simultaneously to see Abby just smiling at them from the doorway. &quot;I 
can&#39;t help but say that it&#39;s just... heart warming.&quot;

      The two girls blushed and Abby just moved over to the kitchen and started cooking 
something else. Seth, Krystal and Isaka would want something to eat pretty soon, so... As 
she set about cooking, the little demon walked back into the house, with a huge grin on her 
face.

      Isaka began to waltz in, until she realized that there were people in the kitchen. Her 
grin soon returned to her five year old face when she saw Mina and Eveon sitting next to 
each other, hands entwined under the table (only possible because Mina was left handed). She 
promptly climbed up a chair and sat down.

      &quot;I&#39;m happy that you two are together. At least I accom... accompli...&quot; Isaka frowned 
and tried to find a different word. &quot;...complete something.&quot; Eveon tried not to giggle at 
her speech impediment and Mina just pinched Isaka&#39;s cheek out of adoration.

      As if on cue, Abby finished her cooking and started to prepare the dish. &quot;You&#39;re a 
lucky little demon... I just finished this batch and you get to have the first bite.&quot; She 
pushed the plate in front of Isaka, who just eyed it with interest. There were bite size 
pieces of dough slightly yellow and misshapen. Abby poured a white, creamy sauce over it 
before explaining. &quot;It&#39;s like icing. Go ahead, my late husband taught this to me. It&#39;s 
commonly eaten somewhere in Asia; I don&#39;t remember what place...&quot;

      Isaka popped one of the pieces into her mouth and reveled in the sweet taste. It was 
like doughnut holes... but so much better! She started to gobble them down and never before 
had she felt so content. Not only had she set her plan to get her body (and Krystal), she 
had just eaten a delicious breakfast. Her five year old body desired more, but her stomach 
was full. She delicately licked the icing off of her fingers as she skipped merrily to 
Krystal&#39;s room.

      Eveon and Mina exchanged confused glances, but put their empty dishes in the sink. The 
blonde girl started to peer over at her mother&#39;s cooking and Abby sighed, &quot;Eveon... I know 
why you want to eat these dough pieces with the icing so badly...&quot;

      She just looked up at her mother in surprise, as did Mina. &quot;Of course. It&#39;s because 
the icing is reminding you of fluids from Mina&#39;s-&quot; Abby couldn&#39;t finish her perverse joke as 
she dodged the chair Eveon threw at her. &quot;Don&#39;t be like that, Eveon! I&#39;ll buy you a truck 
for your sixteenth birthday to make up for it!&quot;

      Eveon started hoisting up the table as Mina fainted from embarrassment.
