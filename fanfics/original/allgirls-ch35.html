The pools would only be open for one last day before autumn&#39;s chill took 
control and forced it closed, so of course nearly everyone would be at 
one or another. Janine, Blake, Victoria, Olivia, and Gabrielle decided 
to make a day of it and planned to go to the nearest one available, and 
invited as many of their friends as they believed could fit inside. 
Blake brought Mira and Usha, who had been working hard because of their 
campaigning and needed a break; Janine and Victoria brought May and 
June, even though the younger twin protested due to her handicap; Olivia 
would&#39;ve brought Ayanna, but she was off on a date, and Gabrielle 
brought Lilian, although it took a great deal of coercion to convince 
the pale recluse to come.

The girls took two cars, seating five each, and more than enough 
equipment to spend, it seemed, several days at the beach. They sang and 
talked along the way, or else complained about somebody&#39;s driving, or 
life and school in general. It was a glorious Saturday morning, just a 
few hours before noon, and since they were coming as early as the pool 
could open, few people were there and so crowding wasn&#39;t an issue. They 
arrived and each paid a small fee before tearing in. Lilian already had 
shades and a parasol out; the sun glared up above.

&quot;What a day!&quot; exclaimed Gabrielle, her face as bright as the sky. She 
gave Lilian her glowing smile, and it was returned meekly. &quot;Well, can&#39;t 
swim in our clothes. Gotta change&#151;and no peeking, any of you!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my line,&quot; muttered Blake, who had not taken her meds. Usha was 
worried, of course, about work and duty, but Mira brought her back to 
earth with her gay nature and exuberance. The campaign could wait, she 
sang; now was the time to enjoy their youth and the warm weather, while 
both lasted! Usha could not easily relax, but since she was forbidden to 
bring anything except what she&#39;d need, she could do nothing about it and 
resigned herself. She walked into the changing room with both her 
girlfriends, and promised herself to refrain from a premature glance at 
their nudity as they changed.

It had been years since June Tramble went swimming, and being confined 
to a wheelchair for most of her day, she was vehemently against coming 
at all. Her legs would not function, and at best all she could do was 
lay around or paddle with her arms, but her sister and Victoria were 
very convincing. Since it had been years since she swam, it was 
difficult getting into a swimsuit with unresponsive legs; Olivia gave 
the girl an understanding look of empathy as she struggled with her own 
lameness. She actually wanted to help June, knowing what it felt like to 
favor one set of limbs over the other, but she didn&#39;t want to impose and 
besides, that&#39;s what sisters were for. She changed alone and tried not 
to stare at too much skin.

&quot;This is tough for me,&quot; she whispered to Janine as the other girl took 
off her clothes and set them in a bag. Olivia motioned towards a group 
of attractive women in the corner, who seemed oblivious to her. &quot;Looking 
at girls dress and undress sends me so many mixed signals. You&#39;ve felt 
like this before, haven&#39;t you Jean?&quot;

&quot;No, can&#39;t say I have.&quot;

&quot;You mean you&#39;ve never felt... difficult when you&#39;re around women?&quot;

&quot;Nope. Just men.&quot; She smiled shyly and slipped the bottom of her bikini 
through her legs, then stretched her arms and chest for the top. It 
covered her conservatively, and it was a good color to match her 
Chinese-Filipino roots. She had more swimsuits than Olivia had pants; 
she just chose that bikini in the hopes of attracting a new boyfriend. 
Olivia cleared her throat and undressed shyly.

&quot;There was that one time.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; A frozen pause strung between them, 
chilling the locker room. Olivia knew she had struck a tender chord.

&quot;But that one time hasn&#39;t made you think about&#151;&quot;

&quot;I said,&quot; she emphasized curtly, standing to give the mostly-nude woman 
a firm glare, &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot; Olivia shyly apologized, 
and dressed into her one-piece in silence. She stared at the lockers in 
hopes of not catching a glimpse of some forbidden patch of womanly 
nakedness, and had to fight herself sometimes whenever an attractive one 
passed. She froze and rubbed her face. Maybe coming here really wasn&#39;t 
such a good idea...

&quot;You okay?&quot; said a mousy voice behind her. Olivia knew it was 
Victoria&#39;s, but as she didn&#39;t know the condition of her friend&#39;s state 
of dress, she just shook her head.

&quot;No, not particularly. I&#39;m having... thoughts and feelings.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s really true...&quot; Victoria sat down next to her, dressed in 
swimming regalia and a towel, and covered her hand in a friendly motion. 
&quot;You really don&#39;t know. Maybe it was a good thing we ended it when we 
did. I&#39;m sorry I caused you so much confusion already, but I had no idea 
the results would carry on this far.&quot;

&quot;Apology accepted,&quot; she said, not knowing what else to say. She turned 
to look at her friend, her ex, and squeezed the hand, attempting a 
smile. &quot;We both messed up, but at least now we&#39;re starting to heal. It 
was so painful for me to be awkward around you, Vic. I hated it, but how 
else was I supposed to cope? I can only be grateful we didn&#39;t get far... 
intimately, I mean. I really am glad we&#39;re starting to treat each other 
like friends again, even though it took a long time.&quot; She nodded.

&quot;It did.&quot; And quiet. Girls chatted. Olivia saw Gabrielle and Lilian 
undressing, backs to each other, one taking shy glances at the other 
from time to time. She managed a smirk. Okay, it was plainly obvious 
they liked each other--only that crazy Irish girl could convince a 
hermit albino to come out and socialize in the sun. And she was just 
Gabrielle&#39;s type, too. Olivia knew better than to push them closer; they 
would come together like lines on the letter &quot;Y&quot;, and merge&#151;

She shoved that thought out of her head. Not good to be thinking like 
that when her best friend had been with her cousin not long ago!

&quot;You ready?&quot; she said, giving Grissom a beautiful smile. Victoria 
flashed all her teeth as she grinned.

&quot;Yeah! I&#39;m gonna dive in!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take the slide. I&#39;m not much for running since&#151;&quot;

&quot;Last one in&#39;s a rotten egg!&quot; Blake had screamed and dove off, Mira 
chasing after her with Usha laughing and lagging behind. Olivia was not 
always the most fun member of the bunch, but hey, summer was nearly 
over, so why not? She picked up her towel and sunblock and dashed out 
after her friends. Poor Lilian was still dressing, but at least 
Gabrielle was still there and as badly as she wanted to go swim, she 
would not leave Lilian, at least until the girl had a shield of sunblock 
on.

&quot;Can I turn around now?&quot; she asked, clad in a dark-green bikini that was 
more cute than sexy. Lilian whispered a yes, and blushed rather loudly 
as she hid her face. Gabrielle&#39;s eyes bulged out, and she nearly drooled 
right on the spot: Lilian was beyond hot in her royal blue and gold 
one-piece, the kind that clung in several nice key spots and left just 
enough to the imagination, making it all the more attractive. She 
swallowed and stammered as she held aloft a bottle.

&quot;W...wow! Ye look great. Y...y&#39;need some help with this lotion, like on 
your back?&quot;

&quot;Mm, I guess,&quot; whispered Nachtheim. She turned around and lowered her 
shoulder straps, exposing a gorgeous field of pale skin and small lumps 
of bone poking out on the spine and shoulders. Gabrielle&#39;s heart 
shivered in her windpipe. Her stomach performed gymnastics. She shivered 
like she had just bathed in ice, and tried oh so desperately not to have 
a nosebleed or any other embarrassing action as she rubbed the lotion on 
her palms and spread it out.

Lilian gave a little shriek when the cold hands touched her, then sighed 
and gave a little coo of pleasure. Nobody had touched her bare back, not 
even Hitomi Madsen (she touched it through the shirt), least of all with 
the nervous care Gabrielle was giving her. It soothed and relaxed her 
better than a masseuse, and of course, it was over well before she could 
really get into it. Gabrielle had to fight to stop.

&quot;I think you can do the rest yourself,&quot; she croaked, and got up to 
leave. Feeling as if she had offended her friend somehow, Lilian took 
her arm and stopped her.

&quot;Wait. Should I not do yours?&quot; Gabrielle froze, turned around, and 
scratched her neck as she smiled in a way that would&#39;ve made anime-lover 
Mira proud.

&quot;Um... uh, yeah, I guess!&quot; She chuckled nervously and sat back down. 
Then she laid on her stomach, and very gingerly, unclasped her top, 
exposing everything save her rear. If Gabrielle had felt aroused by 
looking at Lilian, Miss Nachtheim nearly crumbled as she stared (hard) 
at the nearly-nude young woman below her. With careful, trembling hands, 
she rubbed the lotion across O&#39;Shannon&#39;s shoulders, up and down her 
back, and even took care across her neck. It felt like they were acting 
out a Penthouse letter, but... they didn&#39;t care! It was bliss long 
overdue; no lover had ever been so kind and careful.

Lilian forced herself to stop too. She even hooked the bikini top back 
on. Gabrielle smiled sheepishly and thanked her, but then a dreadful, 
terrible, thick and tricky pause held their mouths and feet. They sat 
together on the changing-room bench, clad only in swimsuits and just 
returned from superior pleasure. They both remembered the time Lilian 
wished Gabrielle had not had a girlfriend. Gabrielle remembered just how 
happy she felt with Lilian; Lilian slowly began to understood what Miss 
Madsen had said to her when they broke up.

The two women slowly, irresistibly drew closer to each other, hearts 
nearly exploding with nervousness and anticipation, throats contracting, 
breath gone, eyes shutting and mouths inching closer and closer to&#151;

&quot;GABRIELLE!!! GET YOUR LAZY IRISH ASS OUT HERE!!!!&quot;

Talk about bad timing.

&quot;Janine sounds pissed,&quot; said O&#39;Shannon flatly. Lilian nodded her head.

&quot;She did not mention me.&quot;

&quot;HEY GAB!! IS LIL IN THERE WITH YOU? TELL HER TO GET HER LAZY KRAUT ASS 
OUT HERE AS WELL!!!&quot;

Lilian Nachtheim could not prevent the laughter that came out. Well, she 
reasoned, the squeaky wheel gets the grease. She and Gabrielle grinned 
at each other, the moment lost but replaced with warmth&#151;and then, with 
the sweet smile still on her face, Gabrielle leaned forward smoothly, 
and did what she had wanted to do for a long time: that is, she kissed 
Lilian Nachtheim on the lips, briefly but firmly, and loved it. Her 
emerald-island eyes sparkled with new love and excitement as she 
withdrew.

&quot;Whew... just in case we don&#39;t get the chance later on. C&#39;mon, Janine 
can get real messy when she&#39;s pissed.&quot; Lilian felt Gabrielle&#39;s hand 
clasp over hers, and felt her feet padding across tile and later sandy 
concrete, and she felt the hateful glare of the sun pierce her sensitive 
eyes and skin, despite precautions&#151;she felt it all, but it was all 
Second, it was all left down, away from the one far greater feeling that 
dominated her like nothing else had. She felt light and free and in 
love; Cloud Nine had nothing on her.

Once Gabrielle screamed at Janine for the verbal abuse, and after she 
got a few approving wolf-whistles from some handsome men gathered round 
the deep end, the last pool party finally started with a splash&#151;yes, pun 
intended. Lilian hated the sun and had to shield her face with a big 
white towel in spite of the dark sunglasses and extra-strength sun 
lotion covering every square centimeter of her body. She crawled 
underneath a large umbrella, and stayed in the safe shade to enjoy the 
heat and fresh air. Several of the girls, people she was beginning to 
consider friends (or better, heh), tried egging her to come and swim, 
but no, too bright outside. She was perfectly happy in the shade.

June Tramble had agreed to come, and after being wheeled out, she 
allowed her sister to lift her onto a lawn chair that could sprawl out 
for her to lie on. She did just that, enjoying the ghostly feeling of 
her legs freed from that mechanical device, and would&#39;ve kicked them in 
pleasure if...... Well, they were free, anyway, and absorbing some 
healthy rays. She could flip herself over just fine, and rotated about 
every thirty minutes until something of a faint red formed on her body. 
Lilian wanted to talk to her, but she was in the middle of the sun, and 
that large umbrella wasn&#39;t going anywhere.

Eventually, after losing a wrestling match with the &quot;Queen of the 
Sharks&quot; (Blake), Victoria pulled herself out of the water and struck up 
a conversation with the handicapped woman. June liked the companionship 
and thanked the younger girl for her kindness, and spoke about anything 
that pleased her, or else nothing and just listened. They both had a lot 
to talk about, and once in awhile, May or Janine (or both) would come 
out and join them. Blake seemed content with wrestling people, and since 
her disorder was in full swing by that time, she was even more fierce 
and unpredictable. Mira loved fighting her, and laughed or coughed out 
water too much to care that she was losing. Usha pleaded to be spared, 
but (according to Blake), &quot;No hot Hindu bureaucrat can escape the 
unstoppable force of... The Queen of the Sharks!&quot;, and of course she did 
not.

Most of those handsome, single men by the deep end enjoyed watching the 
girls play and wrestle and (sometimes) kiss, even though they only had a 
chance with Janine, May, June, or perhaps Olivia. May and Janine 
actually went over to them and exchanged flirtations; June got stuck 
with Victoria, but it wasn&#39;t a bad sentence. After awhile, Olivia got 
out and joined Lilian, and the two had a brief conversation while 
Gabrielle was on her tenth rematch with Blake.

&quot;You like her, don&#39;t you?&quot; she asked, referring to said Irish redhead. 
Lilian could conceal her faint blush better in the shade, but Olivia 
still saw it. She smiled. &quot;Ah, you do. Oh, it&#39;s all right by me. Gab&#39;s 
wild on the outside, but she&#39;s really sweet and gentle. She could use a 
woman like you around. Her last few girlfriends have... not exactly been 
good for her. And that&#39;s saying a lot, since her most recent one was my 
cousin.&quot;

&quot;Your cousin?&quot;

&quot;Ayanna Montgomery. They didn&#39;t last very long from what I heard, but 
they&#39;re not compatible at all. It was more of a fling. The thing about 
Gab is that for all her cheer and sociability, she&#39;s really shy and 
sensitive when it comes to things like romance. She&#39;s still searching. 
Every girlfriend in her past has given her something of what she&#39;s 
wanted, but not everything. I&#39;m not trying to hook you two up or 
anything, mind you,&quot; she remedied with a quick gesture, &quot;I&#39;m sure you 
can do that on your own. I&#39;m just saying... well... it would make her 
happy, that&#39;s all. And I know she likes you. Just mentioning your name 
in public gets her face all red.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Lilian grinned and shook her head bashfully. Olivia, for all 
her confusion about her sexuality, couldn&#39;t help but think the albino 
looked awfully cute. Yup, she and Gab were meant for each other, no 
question about it. It was only a matter of time&#151;and speaking of which, 
Blake finally lost her &quot;title&quot; after the combined efforts of half the 
girls toppled her. Gabrielle was already whooping and screaming over 
such a silly victory as she emerged from the water, dripping and nearly 
nude, face beaming with beauty.

&quot;Well, she&#39;s in a good mood,&quot; observed Johnson. She touched Lilian&#39;s 
hand briefly and gave a rare smile of total joy. &quot;Good luck, but since 
you won&#39;t need it, good day. Bye.&quot; She winked and slipped back in the 
water, unable to jump due to her leg. Gabrielle walked closer, soaking 
but very happy.

&quot;Whoo! Didja see me, Lil?! Was that cool or what?!&quot;

&quot;I saw, very awesome!&quot; exclaimed Nachtheim happily. Gabrielle let out a 
sigh of victory, put her hands on her hips

(looking, Lilian had to admit, a little sexy), and slapped her bare 
tummy.

&quot;Good times. Aw, you should&#39;ve been in there with us! Come on, just a 
few minutes in the water! I swear that&#39;s all I&#39;ll ever ask for! Ya won&#39;t 
crisp up, I promise! Just a few minutes!&quot; Lilian giggled at the 
attention she was now getting, and since it was true that a few minutes 
out in the sun wouldn&#39;t hurt her, she agreed and allowed Gabrielle, the 
girl she officially had a crush on, to help her up, and in. But Lilian 
pushed first.

June also got in, with her sister&#39;s help, and paddled around with her 
arms, enjoying the sensation of standing, if only by the aid of the 
water. She had not stood so high since before the accident, and now that 
she was up and roaming around, people could really see the resemblance 
between the twins. June was a bit shorter and lighter than her older 
sister, and she had long rich dark-chocolate hair instead of her 
sister&#39;s shorter cut, but they were otherwise the same. If they had both 
cut their hair and evened out the tiny weight difference, one could 
scarcely believe they were even twins&#151;rather, two copies of the same 
person.

&quot;Keep trying,&quot; said May, cheering her sister on as she wiggled her 
useless legs around. June had tried to keep her muscles stimulated to 
avoid fatigue and entropy, mostly because she still had some hope that 
technology or time could heal her disability. Doctors had recommended 
she attempt an exercise regardless, and logically, a little swim 
would&#39;ve been perfect. Caving into her sister&#39;s pleas was not June&#39;s 
style, but she could not argue with medical advice. Besides, she badly 
needed the tan, because she was getting pale. Well, they both were.

She actually laughed as her legs touched the bottom of the pool and gave 
way. June fell into the water and burst back out, merry or drunk on 
foolishness, or maybe happy that she came along, because usually her 
handicap depressed her. When she surfaced and clung to the side of the 
pool for dear life, she beamed at her sister and her friends, her new 
friends who liked her and accepted her, who had wanted her to come 
because she was May&#39;s sister, and May was Janine&#39;s friend, and they were 
both classmates anyway. She looked at Olivia and Victoria, whom she 
liked the best for different reasons, and while Olivia smiled and shied 
away, Victoria did not.

She winked. June blushed. Then she slipped and fell under, and came out 
snickering again. Yup, probably drunk. What a day.

.........

Gabrielle lay out sunning and conversing with Lilian; Janine and May 
were with the young men, hopeless and giddy. Blake had given up 
wrestling and resorted to lounging around the shallow end with Mira and 
Usha, trying to get the scoop on their campaigns while relaying soccer 
news. June was still in the pool; Victoria and Olivia were helping her 
glide across the waters. Johnson understood Tramble&#39;s condition to a 
degree due to her mild cerebral palsy, so the two naturally became 
friends by the end of the day, but Vicki (observed many) was flirting 
with her.

Oh, not outright, but only the most clueless observer could miss it. She 
touched and smiled at June in a manner that was more than friendly, and 
encouraged her well past the point of sorority. She found ways, both to 
be discreetly intimate and warm, without seeming too aggressive if June 
felt uncomfortable. The younger twin loved the attention; May observed 
it for a little while during a few lulls, but had no opinion either way, 
except relief that her sister had more friends.

&quot;So, what, are you all like lesbians or something?&quot; asked one of the 
men, who had seen his fair share of same-sex flirtations that day. 
Janine turned red and chuckled.

&quot;Wha? Oh, no, not all of us. Just... just a few of us. I&#39;m certainly not 
gay, and neither is my friend here, and we&#39;re both definitely single.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; The men became more interested and edged closer. One of 
them cheered wildly as Blake, Usha, and Mira embraced each other in the 
water and shared a steamy three-way kiss, successfully embarrassing 
Bautista and Tramble.

&quot;PDA, Blake!&quot; screamed the younger girl. &quot;Save some of that for later! 
God,&quot; she muttered to herself and her company, &quot;sometimes they can get 
so horny.&quot;

&quot;Looks like they&#39;re not the only ones,&quot; said one of the men May liked. 
She looked over where he was pointing, and spotted Gabrielle and Lilian 
openly flirting with each other. It was so appalling, it was cute. Both 
girls rolled their eyes.

&quot;I have a feeling she won&#39;t stop yapping the entire trip home,&quot; murmured 
Janine. She gave May a look and said, &quot;Consider yourself lucky she&#39;s not 
in your car. We don&#39;t call her Blabrielle for nothing, and she never 
stops whenever she gets a new girlfriend. But... I have to admit,&quot; and 
here she became soft and loving, &quot;they do look nice together, and I&#39;m 
glad Gabrielle found someone a little more... down to earth. Her last 
three were just not her.&quot;

&quot;So that cute redhead over there&#39;s gay?&quot; said the man. Janine nodded her 
head.

&quot;Oh yeah. About as Sapphic as they come.&quot;

When all the girls were finally ready to leave, they divided in two and 
stuffed themselves in the cars.

But Gabrielle had a little announcement first.

Everyone knew what she was going to say, but they were happy for her 
anyway.

............

Ayanna Montgomery didn&#39;t go swimming because she had a date with Hero 
Love. Much like Gabrielle, her ex-girlfriend, Ayanna met Hero in phys ed 
class, and knew her loosely through reputation. She was wild and 
outrageous like Furious Hail, but was really just a big lump of 
sweetness with a heart of gold and a surprising extension of friends, 
buddies, pals, and lackeys. Ayanna liked Hero, but was probably more 
attracted to her name than her personality, at least at first.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it a weird name?&quot; she asked one rainy day when Leena kept 
everyone indoors. Hero shrugged indifferently.

&quot;Nah, not really. I was named after a priestess of Aphrodite, so I guess 
the name&#39;s Greek. Hero was also the name of a female character in 
Shakespeare&#39;s Much Ado About Nothing.&quot;

&quot;Ah, that&#39;s cool. Well, I guess if you&#39;re comfortable with it...&quot; 
Leena&#39;s whistle had interrupted them and got them back on schedule, but 
by the end of the day, Ayanna had promised to go out with Hero, bringing 
her cousin for the ride&#151;and at the end of that venture, she was high on 
fun and boiling with attraction towards the pale, curvy woman. They made 
out right in the club and went home laughing. Their date was calmer: a 
few moments in a bookstore, a few at a diner, a walk, some hand-holding, 
a few stories... Ayanna loved her stories and even read a few to Hero, 
or rather, those she was comfortable with. T&#39;would not do for her to 
reveal the more R-rated things she had made on their first date!

Hero had dyed her hair blonde for the moment, with gold stripes going 
down randomly, so maybe that was why Ayanna found her attractive. Or 
maybe she was a free spirit and not as meek as Gabrielle could be. 
Perhaps she was more free with her sexuality; she had dated men and 
women, and could say she brought experience into the relationship. But 
no, it was really her irresponsibility, her recklessness, her nights out 
and her poor grades that Ayanna really loved, and why? Because it 
brought Hero down on a new level, one that proved to Ayanna that the 
best of everyone really was not that great; that, in truth, there is 
more to lament than to praise, and every day was a struggle for 
everyone, especially Hero.

She went to church twice a week. The inner turmoil inside of her was 
staggering. The last time Ayanna had checked, many places of worship did 
not look kindly to same-sex love, at least not the kind she was 
interested in, and Hero did not bother to hide her relationship with 
Ayanna (nor her wild dress, but the church overlooked that). She was 
admirable for that, but still, to be openly bisexual and a member of an 
organized religion was risky business, and Hero knew that every step was 
crossed upon eggshells and thin ice.

Their date ended with a hug and a kiss, and a promise for next time. The 
next day was Sunday. Autumn was closing in. The air was getting colder. 
It broke out into a bad rain the following morning, forcing Ayanna to 
carry an umbrella as she joined Hero. Their greeting, a warm kiss 
underneath the same parasol, did not go unnoticed before the steps of 
the chapel. The holy cross stood high above them, but whether in a smile 
or a glare Ayanna could not tell. She held Hero&#39;s hand for most of the 
service.</pre>
