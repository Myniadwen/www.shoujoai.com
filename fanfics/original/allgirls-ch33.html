any limited edition Astro Boy figurines, so I told him, &#39;Don&#39;t give me 
that, man! I&#39;ll punch you in the face!&#39;&quot;

Pause. Farrah gave Ivory a look of disbelief.

&quot;&#39;I&#39;ll punch you in the face&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; She snickered. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Ivory, if you were going to cause trouble, you could&#39;ve used a better 
line at least&#151;like, &#39;Don&#39;t toy with me, toy-seller!&#39;, or &#39;Hey, I think 
your Baby Drink-n-Wets need changing!&#39;&quot;

&quot;Oh! Or how about, &#39;I&#39;ll lock you up, Phil Locke!&#39; Huh?&quot; Farrah snorted 
and rolled her eyes as she left the cafeteria, but Ivory kept talking. 
&quot;Oh, wait! I&#39;ve got a good one! &#39;Better pick up your toys, mister! Cuz&#39; 
if you don&#39;t, somebody will trip on them and fall down the stairs and 
hurt themselves! Then you&#39;ll feel bad! ...Toy-seller!&#39;&quot;

&quot;Idiot,&quot; murmured Farrah.

Do you wanna be a poet and write

Do you wanna be an actor up in lights

Do you wanna be a soldier and fight for love

Do you wanna travel the world

Do you wanna be a diver for pearls

Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above

Be anyone you want to be

Bring to life your fantasies

But I want something in return

I want you to burn burn for me baby

Like a candle in my night

Oh burn

Or go to heaven and touch God&#39;s face

Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps

Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps

Or an angel

Under grace

I&#39;ll lay down on your bed of coals

Offer up my heart and soul

But in return

I want you to burn

Burn for me baby

Olivia Johnson was walking from Miss Madsen&#39;s class to her next, with 
Zane Klein at her side. She had been assigned to study and report on the 
taller woman, as she had with nearly half the class since the first 
week. Olivia could easily say she knew most of the girls pretty well, 
although she did not like every single one. Zane was a give-or-take, 
hit-or-miss kind of person, really more man than woman, more porcupine 
than platypus, more hexagon than quadrangle (she thought with a 
threatening headache).

Klein was French and German, but could speak perfect &quot;Americanese&quot;, and 
rarely slipped into either of her accents unless she wanted to. She was 
nearly as tall as the school doctor, and was quite heavy and muscular, 
weighing in at a very masculine eight-score and five pounds, most of 
that gained from her days as a jock. She was far from a musclehead, 
though: the woman had a sharp, if not eccentric sense of design, and was 
skilled enough to construct her own apparel, which included what she 
wore that day.

Olivia could identify with the woman&#39;s impatience. Though lost in 
thought a lot herself, she hated it when people ignored her, were 
unaware of her presence, were oblivious to her overwhelming self. She 
had given up trying to be polite two years ago, and had paid for it 
dearly with much scorn and rumors that would follow her beyond college. 
Her crankiness could sometimes be attested to insomnia, which Olivia 
also had on occasion; she was also not a math person, and in fact hated 
school in general, except for biology and particularly anatomy. Just 
writing down Zane&#39;s vital stats took up several pages; there was a lot 
about her, not just the muscular surface or the crazed smile.

Aintzane asked Olivia out on a date. Olivia was flustered.

They had gotten acquainted at that club not long ago, that club where 
her cousin left with that other girl, plumpish and wild; that club where 
the new goalie was found being fondled and snogged by Lex Walker; that 
club where Miss Johnson had tried to have fun, but with her weak leg and 
all, and Zane&#39;s inattentiveness, and such loud music&#151;not her style. She 
ended up slipping out and going to Shakenstein&#39;s.

And now Zane was asking her out, one woman to another, rather openly but 
not with much enthusiasm or interest. She asked only because she was 
bored and she wanted female company, and surely Olivia had more going 
for her than a timid dance step. She was restless, that&#39;s all; she 
didn&#39;t ask out of a yearlong crush or because she simply thought Olivia 
was hot (which she was, and she did); it was just a distraction from 
mundanity.

Johnson shrugged and accepted. What could she lose? It wasn&#39;t as if she 
had any hot prospects. But first things first: acquaintanceship had to 
be attained, or rather, statistics gathered for the report. Aintzane 
Rikke Klein. Only a year her senior and already taller, stronger, and 
more popular. Captain of Stanton&#39;s Badgers. Redhead (like most of her 
friends). Athletic, abstract-thinking, generous, quick to learn and slow 
to think. Multilingual; she was a star in Torvald&#39;s class. Insomniac. 
Chocoholic, to the point of being dangerous and obsessive. Handsome.

Liked goldfish, had three as pets. Played banjo. Sailed during the 
summer, walked during spring and winter, performed in an amateur 
Bluegrass band in the autumn. Read all kinds of books. Gave her 
virginity away two years earlier. Had four lovers, all women. Had a 
long-standing rivalry with Petra Rominostikov, Rodgerson&#39;s MVP. Took 
Literature, History, PE, Sciences, Languages, and Math (spitefully). 
Made her own clothes. Could become emotional. Thoughtful.

&quot;Do you want to go prancing in a leafy glade?&quot; she asked randomly during 
lunch. Olivia spat out her drink and choked on her laughter, even though 
it had been more sudden than funny. Zane rubbed her back and cackled. 
&quot;Ah, I love spit takes.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve... done better...&quot; managed Liv. She composed herself and asked, 
&quot;So where do you want to take me on this soiree? Movies and dinner? 
Bowling? Some other campy place?&quot; Zane nestled her jaw inside the 
knuckles of her fist, resting her elbow on the table as her oak-wood 
eyes sparkled with interest.

&quot;Ya ever been sailing, Liv? I go out on the sea every summer and take a 
whole month just cruising, but there&#39;s a place where I can rent small 
yachts and run along a lake or river.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;d be an awful long drive,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;considering how far 
the nearest body of water is. Sounds like a weekend thing.&quot; She saw the 
look of disappointment on Klein&#39;s face, and smiled apologetically as she 
remedied herself. &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t mean disinterest, I&#39;m just saying it 
doesn&#39;t sound like a first-date kind of thing, but the idea is 
refreshing.&quot;

&quot;Would you suggest something?&quot; she asked. &quot;My idea of a normal date is 
to go down to some wide-open space and just play, or else see if my 
dates can appreciate music. There&#39;s a free concert, I think, somewhere 
off downtown, where that tiny little strip of greenery is.&quot;

&quot;That does sound like more my style,&quot; admitted Liv. She smiled and 
accepted, and since they were on the subject, she figured she could talk 
about her own past romance. &quot;My last date, see,&quot; she began, &quot;was 
everything I mentioned: movie, bowling, dinner, not in order. Complete 
waste of time, and a bore. It was not through those actions that we 
split up, though; rather, she ended it with me. Said it was too awkward 
thinking these things about a friend. We&#39;ve been unreceptive to each 
other ever since.&quot;

&quot;Anyone I know?&quot; asked Zane, intrigued. Olivia nodded.

&quot;Mm, Victoria Grissom, that smallish girl in our class. She was sweet, 
and she knew how to cheer me up, but... she was definitely not my type. 
I think she really has a crush on Janine, which is odd since Janine&#39;s 
straight.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re not?&quot; Zane was giving her a charming smile, but it had no 
penetrating effect. Olivia regarded it with indifference.

&quot;I&#39;m rather not sure. Vicki was my first and only. I&#39;ve kissed girls, 
mostly my four friends, and once Ayanna, my cousin, but I do find myself 
inconceivably drawn to men. They have a charm about them, some do, that 
we women do not.&quot;

&quot;I think girls got all the charm,&quot; said Zane proudly, with a hint of 
seduction in her voice. Olivia shrugged again and fixed her glasses.

&quot;Homosexuals always did confound me. I don&#39;t entirely see the sense of 
being attracted to one&#39;s own gender. Men and women are just easier&#151;if 
for nothing else, reproduction. They protrude, we retract, the pieces 
fit perfectly, like key and lock.&quot;

&quot;Bad imagery,&quot; muttered Zane, looking away towards the crowd. She yawned 
once, twice, three times, a magnificent and politely closed gape that 
impressed Olivia. She looked more horse than human, more satyr than 
nymph, more plastic than cardboard (the headache returned). Zane saw the 
placid look on her face and gave her a soft jab.

&quot;Hey. You bored?&quot;

&quot;I usually am. So little acts as a surprise to me these days. What 
really surprises me is when people act like people, when humans act more 
Human. I swear, there have to be some sub-species of Man around that are 
still stuck in missing-link evolution, too ugly and stupid and stubborn 
to evolve. Either there are very few Humans and many sub-humans, or else 
there are very few Above-Humans, the evolved form of Homo sapien, 
whatever comes next, on a subtler scale. People are just... 
unbelievable.&quot;

Sip. Zane crossed her eyes.

Finally, somebody who made sense!

............

&quot;Uh-oh.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; When Farrah stopped, the girl behind her stopped. She shivered 
in the presence of Stanton, the school she had been transferred to.

&quot;My Lesbian Senses are tingling.&quot;

&quot;Grow up. Don&#39;t act like such a homophobe.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t say much else about a school named after a suffrage leader for 
women&#39;s rights.&quot;

&quot;Elizabeth Cady Stanton wasn&#39;t a lesbian. You&#39;re just paranoid.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m cautious, and unreceptive, not paranoid or homophobic. There&#39;s a 
big difference.&quot; The other girl rolled her eyes.

&quot;Go stick your head in a lake. Come on, you don&#39;t want to be transferred 
again, do you?&quot; Farrah mumbled, hoisted her pack, and followed the other 
girl into the school. That had been her first thoughts on the first day 
of her arrival, and even though it was closing in on mid-September, her 
thoughts hadn&#39;t changed much. Her observations had led her to nearly 
proving her &quot;fears&quot;, or rather her instinct: Stanton was full, or nearly 
full, of lesbians, dykes, bisexuals, gays, homosexuals, Sapphics, and 
every other name and label she could believe, with some rare happy 
exceptions here and there.

The only person who she was happy to see who was not an exception was 
her old pal, Ivory Tran, the only lesbian she knew and loved (it was 
pure sorority love). She and Ivory had went to the same school before 
and had been expelled due to different reasons: one for starting a 
fight, the other for getting involved in the same fight. Farrah had led 
a moderately innocent life until she stepped in to help her friend win 
that battle, but as she usually discovered was the case, good deeds 
never went unpunished.

Farrah wasn&#39;t homophobic, she was just anti-homosexual. She had a 
boyfriend the same age as her, Tristan Reaves, and was more than content 
playing for that particular &quot;side&quot;. At best, she was semi-tolerant of 
the views expressed and believed by the female public of her new school, 
but definitely spoke up about her own view when she could (especially if 
somebody flirted with her). She was careful with her words, though, 
meticulously careful, except in the company of great friends where she 
could speak her heart without fear of reprisal.

Having known and loved Ivory nearly all her life, in spite of spats and 
spits and differences between romantic pursuits, Farrah often vouched 
for her, stood up for her, and understood her better than most people. 
She was Ivory&#39;s interpreter, her more careful and considerate side, the 
diplomat, the rubber. She had no self-esteem of her own, so Ivory filled 
in for that and more; she was Farrah&#39;s cheerleader and encouraged her 
lifestyle with dear Tristan, showing interest and happiness at each 
different interval and milestone. She knew better than to think Farrah a 
potential Sapphic&#151;she would sooner sprout a horse&#39;s body and turn into a 
centaur.

During her friend&#39;s many flings and swings, Farrah had stood to the 
sidelines with Tristan, begging him to be patient with Ivory as she 
cavorted around and slept in nearly every other bed from here to there 
(though in truth, Miss Tran was more flirtatious than she was 
salacious). She had stayed by him, all the while trying to persuade her 
gay friend to at least find one woman and settle with her, at least for 
more than a year, like she had with Tristan. She would even help her, 
for crying out loud, if Ivory ever found someone she wanted to be with 
for so &quot;long&quot;.

So true to her word, when Miss Tran became hopelessly infatuated with 
Miss Yi, Miss Kwong helped the two mesh. It was difficult, largely 
because Ivory had a reputation and it usually preceded her, and even in 
their new school, few had not heard of Tran&#39;s &quot;legendary&quot; status (she 
was a novice next to Alexandra Blair and Aintzane Klein, though). 
Ancelin seemed na&iuml;ve of it, and looked like she would warm up to Ivory, 
as long as the poor stupid girl didn&#39;t go and make an ass of herself, 
which sometimes she did.

Farrah usually just shook her head whenever that happened and wondered 
how long she could put up with it all. Really, Ivory only had herself to 
blame.

Well, of course, Ancelin did eventually find out about Ivory&#39;s lewd 
past, and distanced herself considerably.

&quot;Understandable,&quot; Farrah had said as Ivory relayed the news. &quot;There&#39;s 
some good in this, though. You know this Ancelin is a moral person 
because she doesn&#39;t just jump all over you when she hears you&#39;re, well, 
a slut.&quot;

&quot;A flirt,&quot; insisted Ivory. She had admitted to being a slut before, but 
now it seemed a matter of injury, not pride. Farrah decided to give it 
to her.

&quot;Well, a flirt then. She doesn&#39;t like the idea of anybody advancing on 
her that&#39;s been so... around the block. She&#39;s probably the type who&#39;d 
like her first lover, man or woman, to be as inexperienced as her&#151;to 
grow together and learn, to build from mistakes and so on, a beautiful 
experience in general. Now there&#39;s nothing wrong with a person who knows 
what they&#39;re doing, but you know a little too well. And you&#39;re not 
exactly good at keeping relationships either, even those you like. 
Something or other causes them to break off. This girl, Ancelin, do you 
know if she&#39;s had somebody break her heart?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, her dad,&quot; said Ivory seriously. &quot;He physically abused her and her 
mother for ten years. Eventually they just moved away, filed for divorce 
and his arrest, and lived with relatives, her mother&#39;s brother I think. 
That part really broke my heart, too: her mom&#39;s a really wonderful lady. 
She liked me almost from the start.&quot; (Farrah wanted to make a snarky 
comment, but thought better and stayed quiet) Ivory resumed after having 
a thought, &quot;So you think she believes I&#39;ll end up breaking her heart, 
since it&#39;s been in my history?&quot;

&quot;No doubt. I know I would. If you really want her in your life, Ive, 
you&#39;ve got to earn her trust. Once she&#39;s cooled down and ready to look 
past your shadiness, you should go very slow and make her know you&#39;re 
not about to hurt her. Look, I know that&#39;s the last thing you wanna do, 
but she doesn&#39;t. So take it easy. No second-date tongue kiss, no 
third-date groping, and by all means, no fifth-date sex.&quot; Ivory cursed 
mildly, but Farrah was right--her friend moved too hastily and wanted 
pleasure too quickly. If a relationship was a full course meal, Ivory 
was a vacuum that sucked it all in; she never once tasted anything.

&quot;But what do I do?&quot; asked Ivory, sounding hurt. &quot;She doesn&#39;t look like 
she&#39;ll calm down any second. And... I miss her.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s good. You obviously care about her more than anyone else 
you&#39;ve been with. You&#39;ve told me enough times; believe me, I could make 
your case for you. Just give it some more time. And try not to be too 
forward with her until then. I&#39;ve seen your little declarations of love 
and how you stalk that poor woman, and I must say, I&#39;m tired of cleaning 
up your messes. Marbel has yelled at me enough times.&quot; Ivory moaned 
painfully, and hung her head in shame.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry I put you through all that, Fare. You&#39;re better than a 
sister. I promise you, someday I&#39;ll make it all up to you.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to,&quot; sighed Kwong wearily, as if she regretted saying it 
already. &quot;What I do I do because we go back a long way, and I love you, 
and I&#39;d probably be a boring old stooge without you.&quot; Ivory lightened at 
this, and managed her usual impish smirk.

&quot;Farrah,&quot; she said cattily, &quot;you&#39;re a boring old stooge anyway. But 
you&#39;re the coolest, prettiest, smartest, most wonderful stooge in the 
world, with the possible exception of Curly. Badoom-chi! Rimshot!&quot;

&quot;Oh...&quot; Farrah rolled her eyes and groaned. &quot;You really are a 
poopy-head, Ive.&quot;

&quot;Nah, I&#39;m more of an asshole. But at least I admit it. Hey, want my 
pudding?&quot; She offered Farrah her last cup, and she took her friend&#39;s 
offer gratefully.

&quot;Just consider this your payment and we&#39;re even,&quot; she pointed as she dug 
in. After a few bites, she changed the subject to something more casual, 
less dramatic. &quot;So tell me about your day yesterday. You said something 
about a bad experience?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I went to the toy store yesterday to pick up a limited edition 
Astro Boy figure I heard was in. I looked all over the place, and of 
course, I couldn&#39;t find any, so I went up to the nearest clerk, a real 
pimply-faced kid named Phillip Locke, and told him what I was looking 
for.&quot;

&quot;Oh boy.&quot; Without enthusiasm, Farrah finished her dessert and awaited 
the rest of the story, knowing it wouldn&#39;t turn out well.
