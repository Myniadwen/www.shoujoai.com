Aintzane Klein took a big breath, smoothed her neck-length curly red 
hair, and made sure she was presentable. So...the day had finally 
arrived! In mere moments, the senior class of Stanton High School would 
be graduating, concluding one phase of life and starting the next. 
Frankly, she was a little nervous. Sure, it was a day she had looked 
forward to for a long time, but now that it was here... In the pit of 
her stomach, she felt nostalgic. Would she miss Stanton? Of course. She 
had attended all four years, and felt like the place was her home in a 
sense. Now, in just a few short hours, she would be released into the 
world, a fully-grown woman, along with at least a hundred other girls 
her age, some of whom she would never see again.

She looked around to see everyone&#39;s reactions. A lot of her classmates 
were just chatting normally, like this day was any other. A few stood 
quietly, arms crossed with impatience. Some sat down, already tired of 
standing. A few were already hugging and crying. Zane noticed several 
talking to their boyfriends...and several others who clearly expressed 
interest in other girls. Quite an assortment they had there...and then 
she saw Vai, talking with Avelina, looking peaceful. Vai, so beautiful, 
so out of her reach, like all the other girls. Zane sighed wearily and 
wished this whole debacle was over.

And then, to her surprise, it started. As the orchestra tuned up and the 
choir began to hum their first notes, the students filed out, each one 
reaching her seat, arranged alphabetically. Zane was glad she was 
sitting close to Vai, although one other girl separated them. She could 
see the older girl relax, ease up, and smile eagerly. She deserved this 
moment, having been held back a grade. Zane wanted to talk to her, say 
something, but the ceremony (and three shushing classmates) silenced her 
before she could get much out.

&quot;Vai,&quot; she said, &quot;good luck.&quot;

The valedictorian for the senior class was a woman named Miranda Street. 
May noticed June sink in disappointment and clasped her hand in support; 
Avelina blew out some steam. She had personally tutored Miranda in 
calculus, and this was the thanks she got? Of course, even if she had 
made the top honors, she probably would&#39;ve just frozen, standing on that 
podium in front of all those people. Maybe Avelina and June dodged a 
bullet, because Miranda looked a little nervous and giddy up there. Her 
speech was lame and forgettable; it Bernadette Marbel, the Headmistress, 
who made the biggest impact.

&quot;Good afternoon,&quot; she said, and every student sitting there before her 
replied back: &quot;Good afternoon.&quot; Marbel and Madsen, quietly sitting with 
the other faculty, smiled with pride. &quot;It has been my high honor,&quot; 
continued the Head, &quot;to oversee these fine young ladies for the past 
four years. We have all grown together: academically, socially, 
physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and morally. Time,&quot; she 
said dramaticall; &quot;time is something that is given to us all, to invest 
as we see fit. Over the course of four years, these young ladies, now 
full-fledged women, have demonstrated their capacities for greatness 
again and again. Every one of them deserves praise.

&quot;But, as the great rock star George Harrison once sang, all things must 
pass. Just as these women graduated from grade school to reach middle 
school, and then from there to reach high school, so too will they now 
ascend even higher, attaining levels our humble services could never 
give them. I ask you, what will you make of your future? Do not feel 
ashamed if you have no plans. Oftentimes what we have planned and what 
actually happens will greatly differ. It is not our foresight or our 
ambitions we must exercise, but our adaptability, our willingness to 
bend and adjust, the very will to persevere. I am sure, whatever the 
circumstances, the world will be in very good hands when these young 
women go out into it. I am proud of them all.

&quot;We will now begin handing out the diplomas, certifying a satisfactory 
completion of our school&#39;s curriculum. I ask for family and friends to 
please restrain your applause and admiration until the very end; then, 
join as one and congratulate them all. No one woman here is more or less 
worthy than the greatest praise than the other.&quot; As Sir Edward Elgar&#39;s 
&quot;Pomp and Circumstance&quot; rose up to a stirring crescendo, she smiled, 
nodded to Janet Keys and Andeira Torvald, and one by one, announced the 
names of the graduates, starting first with Felicia Abner. As Ms. Marbel 
went down the list, a few people in the large crowd could not contain 
themselves and burst out, whistling and cheering. Marbel expected this 
reaction and did not frown upon it; rather, she smiled.

&quot;Alisha Fox!&quot; she said. Somewhere in the crowd, Erica whistled loudly 
and clapped her hands, giving her sister a lone standing ovation. Alisha 
walked up to Andeira Torvald, hugged the woman, received her diploma, 
and shook hands with Marbel. A few more students later...

&quot;Aintzane Rikke Klein!&quot; The crowd was mostly silent; Zane felt awkward 
walking up, but she got a supportive smile from Mrs. Keys and a warm 
grin from the Head.

&quot;Vairocana Knox!&quot; Another silent reception; Vai sighed glumly. Oh well. 
She didn&#39;t expect a roaring crowd. Her mothers, bursting with pride, 
held hands and snapped photos madly.

&quot;Lilian Nachtheim!&quot; Gabrielle roared as loud as she could, making a few 
teachers chuckle. Lilian waved quietly and walked up, hugging Torvald 
and Marbel&#39;s hand. She even bent down to embrace Madsen, who whispered 
her support in the young woman&#39;s ear.

&quot;Kathlyn Parkin!&quot; The whole soccer team, even the seniors, stood up and 
screamed her name&#151;&quot;Go, Katt!&quot; Parkin grinned shyly and accepted her 
diploma at long last, and took the time to hug Leena. Marbel gave her a 
warm smile and her final blessings, fully confident that the two women 
would lead happy lives.

&quot;Avelina Marcella Rohani!&quot; Ethan fought to stand and cheer; her parents 
sat with him, adding to his voice. Even Ethan&#39;s adopted mother came 
along, supporting her son and his beloved. Avelina blushed once she was 
on the stage, but took her diploma with grace and sat back down.

&quot;May Romia Tramble!&quot; A quiet howl erupted from where Janine and the 
others sat; May just smiled humbly and waited for her sister to be 
called.

&quot;June Rhea Tramble!&quot; A second howl came from Janine&#39;s area, and the 
crowd lightly applauded as June wheeled up, took her diploma, and 
wheeled back down, ecstatic beyond words.

&quot;Alexis Walker!&quot; A tepid spattering of applause followed. X didn&#39;t care; 
she knew the person who cared for her the most was out there, beaming 
with pride. For this moment alone, she was glad, and actually wept a 
little as she dismissed herself and went back to her seat. And 
finally...

&quot;Raisa Lanceten Zanders!&quot; Ana Lu shouted at the top of her lungs; Rai 
giggled and waved in her girlfriend&#39;s general direction. Since her name 
was so far down the alphabet, she figured she was the very last to 
receive her diploma&#151;but two more came after her, Harriet Zephyr and Beth 
Zworykin (no relation to the &quot;television man&quot;). At last, once all the 
girls were seated, Marbel bade them to stand and move their tassels.

&quot;Friends, family, beloved ones, everyone...I am proud to present to you 
the Class of 2005! Class...you are dismissed!&quot; And with that, the women 
threw their caps into the air, finally ready to take that next amazing 
step into life.

............

Avelina got tackled by her parents and Ethan almost instantly. She 
screamed and laughed for joy, feeling heavenly heights well beyond the 
limits of Cloud Nine, and kissed them all madly. The two lovebirds were 
soon joined by Carlisle Renchina, who came as promised to see her 
friends take that great big leap. She had already expressed her 
happiness to Rai and Alexis; now it was their turn.

&quot;So what next?&quot; she asked them. The two looked at each other and smiled.

&quot;Um...marriage!&quot;

&quot;Avi!&quot; She giggled and waved politely.

&quot;Just kidding. It&#39;s still too early for that. Actually, I was thinking 
about enrolling in a local college. I finally feel like my days of being 
a rolling stone are over. It&#39;s time I gathered some moss!&quot; Carly gave 
Ethan a puzzled stare; he just smiled and said he&#39;d explain it later. 
They were later joined by X, Ana, and Rai, who all shared one great big 
hug and countless photos.

&quot;What about you two?&quot; asked Ana, who thought X and the Wrench were a 
couple. The two mechanics traded a glance.

&quot;I&#39;m taking milady out to dinner tonight. Maybe I could give some of you 
a lift on our way home. Where do you all live?&quot; They all gave her four 
different responses, none of which sounded that appealing. She stared 
back and crooned, &quot;It&#39;s your future! I see...a cab ride! Get yourselves 
a nice apartment, kids, and move out of the sticks. Zanders, Lu, you 
ladies take care. Rohani, Nick, I wish you both the best.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Carly. Thanks for everything. See you soon?&quot;

&quot;As soon as soon is,&quot; she replied vaguely. Taking Alexis into her arm, 
she walked away, pointing to the younger woman. &quot;Now you see that? 
Respect! Respect for one&#39;s elders and one&#39;s debtors. It shows 
character.&quot;

&quot;I have character,&quot; X argued. Carly grinned.

&quot;Just because you are a character, that doesn&#39;t mean you have any.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; said Rai, Ana clinging onto her, &quot;you two up for some lunch? I&#39;m 
taking Ana out to Applebee&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Sounds nice. Ethan, why don&#39;t we take that car?&quot; He chuckled and gave 
her a soft kiss.

&quot;Of course, of course. Do you two have a ride?&quot;

&quot;Naturally. Just follow us, all right?&quot;

&quot;&#39;Kay. Let me tell Avelina&#39;s parents first.&quot; Ana and Rai followed them, 
smiling all the way. When they finally made it out to the parking lot, 
Ana was mildly surprised that Rai no longer had her car. Instead, she 
opted for a motorcycle, something that instantly seemed to suit her 
masculine aura. Ana whistled and hopped on, embracing her lover from 
behind.

&quot;Cool,&quot; she regarded. Rai smiled.

&quot;Thanks, but it&#39;s not mine.&quot;

&quot;Whose motorcycle is this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a chopper, babe.&quot;

&quot;Whose chopper is this?&quot;

&quot;Ned&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s Ned?&quot;

&quot;Ned&#39;s dead, baby,&quot; said Rai as she started the chopper up. &quot;Ned&#39;s 
dead.&quot; Ana shook her head in confusion, shrugged, and held on tight as 
she and her girlfriend rode off into the horizon.

Ned wasn&#39;t really dead.

......

Alisha Fox had been through a lot, but it was now safe to say that she 
liked her life. She and her sister were on good terms again, she had a 
wonderful girlfriend, she was now graduated and already had a promising 
career ahead of her...life was definitely nice. The celebration they all 
shared that day was mild but fun, the Fox sisters trading barbs as usual 
and Olivia soaking it all up. She was glad to be away from her friends 
for once: those tittering little girls were really starting to influence 
her in a bad way. Alisha and Erica weren&#39;t that different, but at least 
they were new, and Olivia could look at them differently, particularly 
the elder sister.

The trio went home for the evening, and were soon joined by Jocelyn, 
Allie, and Corona: the perfect recipe for a wild sleepover. What the 
girls did there was not suitable for written records, but it was safe to 
say that they all had fun and grew closer in love. Erica spent the night 
making sweet love to Jocelyn, the girl of her dreams, and finally felt 
like the two of them would have a real, honest chance at a relationship. 
Alisha and Olivia shared a bed as well, but opted to skip sex. Just 
being in each other&#39;s arms was sufficient.

&quot;I am so lucky,&quot; Olivia whispered, &quot;to have a sweetheart like you as a 
girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...yeah? You should see me when I get pissy.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve seen you pissy. I still love you. It&#39;s cute in a way.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Really? Well what about your dark side?&quot;

&quot;Mmm,&quot; purred Johnson, &quot;that&#39;s a story for another time, beautiful.&quot; 
Alisha laughed and snuggled closer, feeling happiness and sleepiness 
overwhelm her much as the loving arms of her girlfriend enveloped her 
and rocked her slowly into slumber.

......

May felt she owed Janine for skipping out on their first night spent as 
lovers, so she stayed in bed the whole time until Janine woke up. What 
an experience! It was one thing to spend the whole night naked, and 
another to spend it with her friend by her side, but to curl up with 
that heavenly scent and that magical touch of bare womanly skin...oh, it 
made her dizzy! She smiled sweetly as she and Janine woke up, and shared 
several timid kisses before crawling out to freshen up.

Most of their day was spent in leisure, watching movies or playing 
games. They didn&#39;t even stop to eat; they both microwaved a big bowl of 
popcorn and shared it as they blew through yet another romantic comedy 
film. The only real break in their activities came when May hopped out 
to get the mail. Her eighteenth birthday was just around the corner, so 
she was expecting cards and presents any day now (naturally, Janine had 
already given May her &quot;present&quot;). She toddled back inside the house, 
shutting the door with her foot as she sorted through the mail. It was 
mostly junk, but one letter stood out to her.

&quot;Oh my goodness,&quot; she whispered breathlessly, feeling her body lift with 
delight. It was from one of the colleges she had applied for, the one 
she had her heart set on! Janine walked over as her girlfriend numbly 
tore it open and folded the letter out. A few suspenseful seconds passed 
as she read it...and then finally squealed, jumping for joy.

&quot;I got in! I got accepted! I&#39;m going to college! YAAHH!!!&quot; Janine hopped 
up and down as well, overjoyed for her girlfriend. She knew how 
important this was, and was glad that May got into the one she wanted. 
The two kissed passionately for awhile, sharing quiet smiles 
together...but May gradually became distant.

&quot;Wait,&quot; she whispered, suddenly feeling her heart sink. &quot;Wait. There&#39;s 
bad news too. Janine...this was the college I wanted to go to, more than 
any one, but...well, it&#39;s two states over. I&#39;m going...to have to move.&quot;

The full scope of May&#39;s words didn&#39;t sink in until later.

Oh no.

May was going to have to move, to another state.

&quot;Oh,&quot; managed Janine, feeling crushed. Sure she was glad that her 
girlfriend got accepted to the college of her choice, but...this would 
now separate them. &quot;May...you know, it won&#39;t be so bad. You&#39;re only two 
years ahead of me. It won&#39;t be that long before we can...be together 
again.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s going to be so tough,&quot; said May, her voice thick with emotion. &quot;We 
just got together, and now this. I mean...I&#39;m overwhelmed, and I want to 
enroll, but&#151;&quot;

&quot;No, honey, no buts,&quot; said Janine, taking her hand as she scooted 
closer. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;ll be fine. This is the opportunity of 
a lifetime! I am so...happy for you!&quot; She leaned in to kiss May&#39;s cheek, 
and boldly moved to her lips, sucking their sweet taste in 
greedily&#151;knowing that in just a few short weeks, the love of her life 
would be gone. She tried to grin, for May&#39;s sake, as she added, 
&quot;Besides, it&#39;s only two years, and we can see each other over the winter 
and summer holidays. And we&#39;ll keep in touch, right?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; she croaked, nearly on the verge of tears. She laughed out of 
sadness and kissed Janine&#39;s hands. &quot;Yeah. Two years. We can wait that 
long. And we&#39;ll certainly communicate. Yeah...it won&#39;t be so bad. I 
think we need to have a talk, though.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed. Janine suddenly realized there was something 
missing&#151;and before it was too late, she wanted to fill that in, to make 
up for the loss. &quot;...I&#39;m in love with you,&quot; she announced. May stared at 
her, first in amazement, then in love.

&quot;Then we really need to talk!&quot; she exclaimed. The two shared a giggle, 
scooted close, took hands, and looked once again into each other&#39;s 
eyes&#151;together.

......

Kathlyn Parkin packed the last of her boxes in the car, took a deep 
breath, and looked at her old run-down house for the last time. Her 
brother Matt was now a permanent resident of his friend&#39;s house, leaving 
Mom and Dad to take care of things on their own. Kathlyn was overjoyed 
with her newfound freedom: with her eighteenth birthday and graduation 
now just memories, there was nothing holding her back from the life she 
yearned for. After double-checking everything, she hopped into the car 
she borrowed from her older brother and drove off, swearing to never set 
foot inside that destructive place again.

It didn&#39;t take her long to find the familiar apartment complex. Her 
hands shook with excitement as she turned the ignition off, opened the 
door, dashed out (forgetting everything else), and burst into the main 
door. In spite of her weak lungs, she vaulted up the stairs and made her 
way to the abode of her love, her life, her savior and her sweetheart, 
and knocked. The smile on Leena&#39;s face was priceless as she welcomed 
Kathlyn into her arms.

&quot;I&#39;m home!&quot; she exclaimed, meaning every word.

......

June smiled up at Victoria as they met in the park, but young Grissom 
was not so enthusiastic. She shied away when June tried to kiss her, and 
kneaded her hands anxiously. The young woman clearly had things on her 
mind, and with a heavy heart, she knelt down, took June&#39;s hand, and 
looked her in the eye.

&quot;Sweetie, what&#39;s the matter?&quot; asked Tramble. Victoria knew this was 
going to be hard for both of them, but she had to be true to her heart. 
She could no longer deny her real feelings. She had to be honest.

&quot;June,&quot; she squeaked sadly, &quot;I...I&#39;m breaking up with you.&quot;

......

The faculty of Stanton gathered together at a local Chili&#39;s to celebrate 
the passing of one year and the prospect of another. As they all sat 
around the table, laughing and chatting, Bernadette Marbel couldn&#39;t help 
but smile with pride. So many wonderful women here, each dedicated to 
mentoring the world&#39;s future leaders and workers, every one of them a 
cherished part of her life. There was Hitomi and Abigail, affianced and 
beaming; there was Janna and Abi, timidly testing the waters of their 
own relationship, and Janet Keys, her dear friend and advisor, taking 
time to relax and unwind.

Over in the corner were Elspeth and Sonia, holding hands and flirting as 
always. There was Emma and Sarah, talking politics with Dr. Andrews; and 
Samantha, dear woman, who was now at peace with herself and her new path 
in life. Leena was there too, laughing with the others, sparing Marbel 
glimpses of gratitude and thanks. Finally, there was Andeira, the person 
whom Bernadette felt the most satisfaction towards. The brave woman was 
sacrificing her own chance at a new life to resume this one, selflessly 
trudging on despite whatever might be thrown in her direction. She loved 
them all, and as soon as she could, stood to toast them and the year 
that had passed.

&quot;I want to thank you all for continuing your excellent work this year,&quot; 
she began. &quot;Stanton&#39;s school for girls would never function without you. 
You are the true heroes of today&#39;s world, spreading the greatest tools 
our future leaders can have to shape the world into a better place. I 
salute you all.&quot; They all raised their glasses and drank; she resumed, 
less formally.

&quot;I must admit, I&#39;m glad those crazy seniors are out of our hair!&quot; The 
whole bunch laughed and applauded; some even whistled. &quot;But of course, 
we&#39;ll have a whole new batch of first-year students coming shortly, so 
don&#39;t think you&#39;re all getting off easily! I want to see all of you 
working our students hard, pushing them to new levels, preparing them 
for the world outside of school. Take this summer vacation well, my 
friends,&quot; she advised them. &quot;We only have two and a half months to rest 
up before we do it all over again.&quot;

EXEUNT Once upon a time you dressed so fine

You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn&#39;t you?

People&#39;d call, say, &quot;Beware doll, you&#39;re bound to fall&quot;

You thought they were all kiddin&#39; you

You used to laugh about

Everybody that was hangin&#39; out

Now you don&#39;t talk so loud

Now you don&#39;t seem so proud

About having to be scrounging for your next meal.

How does it feel

How does it feel

To be without a home

Like a complete unknown

Like a rolling stone?

You&#39;ve gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely

But you know you only used to get juiced in it

And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street

And now you find out you&#39;re gonna have to get used to it

You said you&#39;d never compromise

With the mystery tramp, but now you realize

He&#39;s not selling any alibis

As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes

And ask him do you want to make a deal?

How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

Like a complete unknown

Like a rolling stone?

You never turned around to see the frowns on the jugglers and the clowns

When they all come down and did tricks for you

You never understood that it ain&#39;t no good

You shouldn&#39;t let other people get your kicks for you

You used to ride on the chrome horse with your diplomat

Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat

Ain&#39;t it hard when you discover that

He really wasn&#39;t where it&#39;s at

After he took from you everything he could steal.

How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

Like a complete unknown

Like a rolling stone?

Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people

They&#39;re drinkin&#39;, thinkin&#39; that they got it made

Exchanging all kinds of precious gifts and things

But you&#39;d better lift your diamond ring, you&#39;d better pawn it babe

You used to be so amused

At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used

Go to him now, he calls you, you can&#39;t refuse

When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose

You&#39;re invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

How does it feel

How does it feel

To be on your own

With no direction home

Like a complete unknown

Like a rolling stone?
