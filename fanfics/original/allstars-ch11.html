12:34 pm

 

As Shiki Araya climbed down the stepladder, she gazed up at the small, 
homely decoration, a trifling contribution she wanted to make to remind 
the team of who they were and what they were made up of- and to remind 
her of home, a little. Inside the new locker room designated for 
Carnegie&#39;s women soccer players, high up on one of the bare walls, Shiki 
had nailed thirteen small boards, with the names of each player 
hand-painted on, and several more for the Coach and staff. From right to 
left, they read, in the order they were first recruited:

FAUSTA NAZARIO

ELISA BERKELEY

LAUREN OFDENSEN

FELICITY VELUR

NADIA KHOVANSKY

TERRA TU

AMY NGUYEN

SHANNON THREAL

KASUMI BECKETT

ARINA ESSYLT

JENNIFER ANDRE

ALICE HAWTHORNE

FREYA VON HOHENHEIM, MANAGER

KATHLYN PARKIN-KATAJISTO, MARIA MAETHERS, ARAYA SHIKI, STAFF

LEENA PARKIN-KATAJISTO, COACH

&quot;Perfect,&quot; she smiled. &quot;And there&#39;s plenty of room for more. We still 
have four days left before the semester starts.&quot; She looked outside at 
the gloomy rain, glad she had worn an older outfit today. Shiki didn&#39;t 
think anybody would be rushing to the field or the gymnasium, so 
everyone was more or less free for the day, and she wanted to spend her 
morning giving the locker room a little more atmosphere. Freya and Maria 
were off somewhere else; Shiki tried to contain her senseless envy. Even 
after all these years of being Hohenheim-dono&#39;s trusted caretaker, 
bodyguard, and lover, she still had to remind herself that sometimes, 
Maria needed some time alone with Freya as well.

Sometimes.

&quot;I hope they&#39;re doing well,&quot; she murmured, fearful of the nasty weather. 
The torrential downpour didn&#39;t look like it was about to stop anytime 
soon. Shiki picked up her umbrella and winced as she ran back out into 
the storm.

Let me follow

 

&quot;Saturday Night Movie&quot;

 

&quot;Yes, Nana, I&#39;m doing well. It&#39;s a beautiful school, and very peaceful, 
but I was surprised to learn they had this kind of night-life. ...Yes, 
you&#39;d certainly love it as well! ...No, I&#39;m sure there are plenty of 
ladies here who would love to meet you. It&#39;s not just us children, 
babushka. ...Oh, only sometimes. I can take that tone now, you know. 
...Somebody I like? Nana, please, it&#39;s barely been a week and you&#39;re 
trying to hook me up with someone? ...You&#39;re right, I guess. Love and 
God are both mysterious; you can&#39;t figure them out. They strike hard and 
leave you senseless, but once you&#39;re smitten, with love or religion, 
it&#39;s like you&#39;re on fire. ...No, those are not your words! They&#39;re an 
original creation! ...Oh, stop pestering me, Nana, I&#39;m just trying to 
get settled in! I&#39;ll meet someone when I&#39;m good and ready.

&quot;...Of course she&#39;d give me her blessing. I can only hope that she found 
true love as well. ...If you&#39;re going to be that persistent, then I may 
as well tease you, if only to shut you up! ...All right, whatever you 
say, Nana. Actually, there is somebody I like, and she&#39;s even on the 
same team. ...No, I have not seen her in the showers yet! What a 
perverted babushka you are! Oh- my break is almost over. I can&#39;t make 
calls while I&#39;m on the clock, unless it&#39;s an emergency. ...Nana, that is 
not an emergency. ...Yes, of course I&#39;ll introduce you to her, Nana, 
but...well, I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;s really interested. ...Honestly now, 
get with the times, Nana! Things don&#39;t work out that way anymore. I&#39;m 
going to go clock back in now, Nana, so I&#39;ll call you later. ...Yes, she 
is beautiful. ...No, she... There&#39;s something weighing her down, Nana, I 
can tell. Just being her friend for now is good enough. ...Nana, really. 
Okay, I&#39;m really hanging up now. Go tease women your own age. Who knows, 
you might get lucky! ...Okay, goodbye, and take care. ...I love you too, 
babushka.&quot;

Nadia Khovansky put her cell phone back in her vest pocket. That 
grandmother of hers was such a handful... But she had to smirk 
defiantly: the resemblance between their personalities was striking. As 
she lifted herself out of the beanbag chair and sauntered out of the 
employee rec room, Nadia made sure to give her favorite coworker a 
cheerful smile and a friendly wave, hoping that her efforts would 
finally have some effect. The results were sparkling: Felicity Velur 
actually made eye contact with her and nodded.

&quot;Someone&#39;s in a good mood,&quot; Gardenia noted, saying what Felicity could 
not.

&quot;Uh, mostly. I&#39;ve been talking to my Nana; she wants to be seeing what I 
do here, like spy almost. I love babushka very much, but she iz like old 
horse sometimes.&quot;

&quot;A nag?&quot; Gardenia chuckled. &quot;At least you and your grandmother are 
close, Nads. Mine pretty much disowned the whole family. Anyway, let&#39;s 
forget about familial dysfunctions for awhile and concentrate on 
something fun.&quot;

&quot;What iz that saying mean?&quot; Nadia said.

&quot;Family problems,&quot; Felicity informed her. Nadia chirped.

&quot;Ah, thanks, angry kittiez! Please not use big Enklish words for me. So 
what iz this fun you talk of?&quot;

&quot;Ah, an excellent question,&quot; Gardenia pointed zestfully. &quot;Today is 
Saturday, and that means the Lily Club will be presenting her 
world-famous Saturday night double feature film festival! You two 
haven&#39;t been here for very long, so you&#39;re probably wondering what all 
the fuss is about.&quot; Nadia and Felicity exchanged a look of questioning.

&quot;No, not really. We haven&#39;t heard anything about it until now.&quot;

&quot;Buzy with football work,&quot; Nadia added. Gardenia looked flush.

&quot;Uh, oh yeah, I forgot you two were on the team now. Anyway, around the 
time I bought this place and turned it into the sanctuary we all know 
and love, I decided to host a double-feature on Saturday nights free to 
the public. Usually, my first movie is a mainstream favorite, and I 
never show anything R-rated. But the second one is...uh...well, let&#39;s 
just say that there&#39;s a reason I host it later.&quot;

&quot;Ah, goodie, sweet flower lady lovez naughty movies!&quot; Felicity turned 
pale as she dared to imagine it- fearful and yet eager to learn more.

&quot;But you don&#39;t really play anything racy, do you? Not to the public.&quot;

&quot;But of course I do,&quot; she replied casually, as if it were the simplest 
thing in the world. &quot;That&#39;s why they&#39;re the second feature. Don&#39;t act so 
uptight! Only a few devoted people stick around anyway, and I always 
make an announcement regarding the switch. If someone watches something 
and gets pissed off, it&#39;s their own damn fault.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, no room for foolz here!&quot; Nadia grinned. Gardenia chuckled and 
agreed with her, leaving Felicity to marinate in her curiosity. A 
mainstream feature open to the public, followed by a raunchier movie 
later on...and given the reputation of the Lily Club and her brazen 
manager, that could only entail one thing. Even though she knew she 
wouldn&#39;t be allowed (or be able) to stick around for the second program 
(her work shift coincidentally ran over the showing of the first film), 
Felicity was dying to know what the selection would be.

&quot;So just what are you playing?&quot;

&quot;Well, if you had read our fliers, you&#39;d know,&quot; Gardenia said. She was 
kind enough to present one, and tapped the message firmly. &quot;Time to get 
involved in your job, Felicity. I like you and I want you to be happy, 
but that&#39;s a two-way street. If you&#39;re not involved, there&#39;s no point in 
you staying here. Here, keep this- and invite your friends! I&#39;d love to 
see all the hot babes you suckered into the team.&quot;

&quot;There are many sexiez,&quot; Nadia admitted as Felicity scanned the Lily 
Club&#39;s weekly bulletin. Sure enough, there was a segment on the Saturday 
films: the first would be the camp classic Batman the Movie, but the 
second selection startled her. Felicity stared just to be sure: she 
owned a film with that exact same title.

No mistaking it. The Rio Rasmovanok classic, Sappho&#39;s Diner.

&quot;Awesome!!&quot; Nadia screamed. &quot;I love Rio Rasmovanok films!&quot; She babbled 
in Russian for at least two minutes straight, then calmed down with a 
nervous titter as she realized what she was doing. &quot;Oops, sorry. I, uh, 
just said that I love her work, but I have never seen her filmz before, 
so I will stay here to watch it.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful!&quot; Gardenia exclaimed. &quot;What about you, Felicity? You think 
you might be able to stay?&quot; That was a terrible question to ask her. It 
had taken every drop of courage for Felicity to buy that movie from the 
erotica store, and she nearly had a heart attack watching it the first 
time in her old house, with her strict father just a few steps away. She 
hadn&#39;t had the time to watch it leisurely, or without her headphones, 
what with soccer try-outs...and of course, there was soccer to consider. 
No doubt Leena would expect them all to be there early Sunday morning 
for additional practice.

&quot;Um, no, I can&#39;t. I&#39;ve got practice.&quot;

&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Gardenia balked. &quot;Have you taken a look outside? It&#39;s 
raining pitchforks and panhandles! There&#39;s no way you&#39;d have practice!&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t,&quot; Nadia said, her words a death-knell to Felicity. &quot;Coach 
Leena said that with weather, we will not have meeting, but she will be 
in gym for what she callz &#39;Q and A.&#39; Kittiez,&quot; she squeaked, nudging her 
coworker with her shoulder, &quot;are you so being angry that you play with 
the hooks? Or are you having church appointment?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she grunted, pushing Nadia away, &quot;I don&#39;t, but...I just can&#39;t stay 
that late.&quot;

&quot;Any particular reason?&quot; Gardenia said. Felicity threw her hands up and 
stormed off.

&quot;Would you just butt out?! I&#39;ve got work to do! There&#39;s a line forming.&quot;

&quot;Oh, shit,&quot; Gardenia groaned, &quot;I forgot all about that! D&#39;ohh! Nadia, be 
a friend and help us out, and be sure to pass out those fliers! I want 
this place packed for tonight! Say, do you two wanna borrow some 
costumes for the show?&quot;

&quot;Ooh, we get to be dressing up for make-believe?! Is called cosplay, da? 
Me too, me too, sounds fun, sounds fun!&quot;

&quot;Excellent! Hey kitties, what about you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m busy!&quot; she bellowed. Gardenia smacked herself in the head, sighed, 
and gave Nadia an expression of defeat.

&quot;Good lord, when will that woman loosen up?&quot;

 

- Alice Hawthorne, 23, 6&#39;4&quot; (1.93 m), right midfielder-

 

Nadia and Gardenia soon went back to work: waiting on tables, serving 
drinks, cooking the meals, cleaning the place, passing out fliers, and 
chatting with the customers. Felicity was as hardworking, serious, and 
focused as ever, and while Nadia wanted to try and cheer her up, the 
time wasn&#39;t right yet. She was still a little sore about being pushed 
too far, and she had a lot of impatient women to look after (and at 
least three or four curious men). Nadia dove right in and helped 
shoulder half the burden, infecting everyone with her sweet smile and 
bouncy charm.

&quot;I come gifting bearz for all!&quot; she sang as she dispensed meals all 
around. &quot;Yes, straight from angry kittiez cooking to table! Will you be 
staying for filmz tonight? We have great sexiez for you all! Have you 
been hearing of Rio Rasmovanok? Nyet? She is great revolutionary film 
Director from my homeland! Stay and watch! First film iz costing no 
money for public, and second iz for adult who stay up past midnight. No, 
iz not pornography! Rio Rasmovanok would never make pornography! Her 
films are sexiez that make you think.&quot; There was a lot more that Nadia 
wanted to say, but her English was still limited, and she couldn&#39;t 
properly describe the films without slipping into her native tongue. 
Felicity, meanwhile, was left to tend the counter by herself, which was 
perfectly fine with her- nobody would distract her that way. She tried 
behaving a little better around the general public, but it was hard for 
her to be so uplifting; she couldn&#39;t understand how Gardenia and Nadia 
pulled it off. Maybe they were from Saturn or something.

Once she got back from lunch, Felicity noticed something had changed 
about the Lily Club: there were more familiar people lounging around. 
She remembered their faces from the games and the meetings, but she 
couldn&#39;t place all their names yet. She knew Freya- she was the gorgeous 
blonde with the slow, noble gait, led by a feisty fashion designer- and 
she recognized Alice easily enough, since she towered over the crowd. 
There was a Hispanic woman gossiping next to Maria, and a casual-looking 
woman following her, dressed in mechanic&#39;s overalls and a cap, smiling 
idly as she waited for her chance to sneak into the conversation. She 
didn&#39;t yet realize the futility of her actions: the two fashion moguls 
were off in another world, and she, fresh from her job as a maintenance 
specialist, was the quintessential round peg in a square hole.

&quot;Hello!&quot; the Hispanic woman exclaimed as she noticed Felicity. &quot;I 
thought I recognized you! We&#39;re on the team together, but I&#39;m not sure 
that we&#39;ve really met. Do you work here?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yes. I&#39;ve, uh, got my name on my badge.&quot;

&quot;Tell me anyway,&quot; she insisted, giving Felicity a rather sultry stare. 
Velur suddenly felt very hot under the collar, and stiffly extended her 
hand. What she felt from the woman&#39;s touch was like nothing she had 
experienced before: youth and uninhibited passion, mixed with a fiery 
bravery and boundless self-expression. Felicity was a little canary 
trapped in a cold, tiny cage, meeting a majestic macaw for the first 
time. Like so many people who met Valencia Durante, she was captivated 
at once.

&quot;Felicity Velur.&quot;

&quot;Valencia Durante, and we all know Lauren, Freya, and Alice,&quot; she 
trilled, rolling her Rs fluidly. &quot;So what&#39;s good for today, Felicity?&quot; 
Freya and her companion laughed crudely as Valencia leaned forward, 
flirtatiously exposing her gorgeous toasted skin, her eyes fixed on 
Felicity&#39;s, wondering if she would dare to look down. Velur couldn&#39;t 
help sneaking a quick peek, but forced her eyes upward until they were 
locked on Valencia&#39;s eyebrows. It wouldn&#39;t be proper of her to...

&quot;Um, well, we don&#39;t have any specials going on, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re 
asking, and...uh...if you&#39;re asking what I like, that&#39;s only a matter of 
opinion. Oh, um, wait.&quot; She was glad to get an excuse to move away; she 
clawed for the fliers and gave a handful to her guests. &quot;Uh, if you&#39;re 
all interested, there&#39;s going to be some movies showing later today. 
Uh...I guess all the information is right there.&quot;

&quot;Aw, sweet!&quot; the woman in overalls shouted. &quot;You&#39;re showing the old 
Batman movie? Hahah, I am definitely there! What about you, babe?&quot; 
Valencia shrugged indifferently.

&quot;Meh, those sorts of movies really aren&#39;t my thing. It sounds so 
corny...but I&#39;ll probably watch the other one. What about you, Felicity? 
Are you going to stay?&quot;

&quot;Well, um, my shift overlaps with the Batman movie, so I don&#39;t have much 
choice...but I&#39;ll probably leave before the other one starts.&quot;

&quot;Aww, that&#39;s too bad! You should stay! Do you have any previous 
engagements?&quot; Valencia was so beautiful and warm, nothing at all like 
that irritating brat Nadia-

I just wish I could look at her once and be honest with her.

- and she wove such a convincing proposal. Felicity swallowed hard, 
pondering over the situation gravely. She and this stunning beauty 
sitting in the dark together, watching a searing, erotic movie crafted 
lovingly by a real artist... She wanted to say she did have other plans, 
because her father would be expecting that, and regardless of the 
weather or the turnout, he would want her to practice. In fact, he was 
even against this job of hers, and it took all of her courage just to 
hold out for this final hope, this last grasp at a slippery straw, her 
ultimate redemption back into the embrace of real people and real 
friends... Deep down, Felicity knew she didn&#39;t want to refuse...but...

&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; she answered numbly, &quot;but I probably shouldn&#39;t stay up that 
late anyway. You know, with practice.&quot;

&quot;Practice doesn&#39;t start until later, Velur,&quot; Lauren mumbled. She grinned 
at Gardenia and offered to buy her date some lunch, but it was obvious 
that Valencia was interested in someone else.

&quot;She&#39;s right. Besides, it&#39;s a Saturday night, and like this flier says, 
it&#39;s the last chance you&#39;ll probably get to stay up that late. Why don&#39;t 
you take it?&quot;

&quot;Look, why are you bothering me so much about it?&quot; Felicity grumbled. &quot;I 
said I couldn&#39;t make it. Isn&#39;t that good enough?&quot;

&quot;But- &quot;

&quot;Let her do what she wants,&quot; Freya said as she perched on a stool. She 
smiled brightly at Felicity, which nearly drove the poor girl&#39;s hormones 
off the edge. Being hit on by Valencia had been astonishing enough; 
Freya&#39;s personality nearly fried her brain. But the way she stared into 
Felicity&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t suggest playfulness so much as empathy. &quot;If it 
genuinely makes her uncomfortable, let&#39;s not push her. We&#39;ve only just 
started as a team, so we can&#39;t expect everyone to be friends right off. 
But you are going to be our friend, Felicity, given enough time.&quot;

&quot;Uh, sure. So can I get you all anything else?&quot;

&quot;How about some Sex on the Beach?&quot; Valencia purred. Felicity grimaced in 
terror; the others laughed at her expression.

&quot;Not much of a bartender, huh?&quot; Lauren grinned. Gardenia came by with 
their orders just then, and gently took over for her poor employee.

&quot;Lay off, everyone, she&#39;s new. Felicity, a Sex on the Beach is just a 
cocktail made of vodka, peach schnapps, cranberry juice, and orange 
juice.&quot;

&quot;Although in a place like this, that term could be applied literally,&quot; 
Lauren muttered foxily. She winked at Valencia, but her actions went 
unnoticed: the Hispanic woman watched as Gardenia taught her employee 
how to make the drink, even though she wouldn&#39;t be able to legally sell 
it for two years, then turned her focus to Felicity, who never allowed 
her gaze to linger in one place for very long. If only she could figure 
out what was going on inside that tortured princess&#39;s mind...

Mmm, cheesecake! Damn this regiment I&#39;m on!

Yes, if only she knew...

 

- Shannon Threal, 19, 5&#39;7&quot; (x m), sweeper-

 

Felicity was concerned that Gardenia would expect her employees to work 
during the movie, and while she did ask them to perform a few chores, 
she gave them the rest of the evening off and told them they were free 
to stay. Nadia, being the social butterfly she was, quickly cozied up to 
Alice, yet another tortured soul she desired to bring into the light. 
Freya rested her head on Maria&#39;s lap as her lifelong friend softly 
caressed her golden tresses, and Lauren tried, in vain, to seduce 
Valencia away. She eventually gave up, shrugging casually, and decided 
to retire gracefully by picking up more treats for her friends. The word 
&quot;loser&quot; just wasn&#39;t in her dictionary.

As for Felicity? She took Gardenia up on her offer and left early, 
though the rain was still coming down hard. She drove back to her 
apartment, her clothes sprayed, and went inside to dry off. She 
considered it a peculiar twist of fate to have Kasumi Beckett as a 
roommate, but the arrangement worked out: they both kept to themselves 
and got along fairly well, although they were still very awkward with 
their personal feelings. One could say that while they both desired to 
take that definitive step, they were each trapped by a different 
obstacle that stood a certain distance away from their total freedom.

&quot;You&#39;re home early,&quot; Kasumi greeted. She was already in her bedclothes- 
a t-shirt and boxer shorts that showed off her strong legs- and was 
munching on some popcorn as she read a Burst Angel manga.

&quot;Well, Gardenia let us go home early.&quot;

&quot;Oh. You didn&#39;t want to stay for the movie?&quot;

&quot;You knew about that?&quot; Kasumi grunted and pointed to her desk.

&quot;Mm-hmm, Odessa gave me a flier today.&quot;

&quot;So why aren&#39;t you going?&quot;

&quot;Meh, I just decided to stay home and veg out. Sides, the weather&#39;s 
brutal. So why&#39;d you bail?&quot;

&quot;I just didn&#39;t want to stay there,&quot; Felicity sighed. She went to her 
small room, undressed, put her pajamas on, and went back to grab a late 
snack. Maybe spending some time with her roommate would be the best 
thing for her. Before heading to the kitchen, Felicity opened the top 
drawer of her dresser, where she kept her delicates, and shuffled 
through them to pull out an old friend. She stared at its beautiful art 
design, a cheerful diner brimming with a large cast of colorful 
characters, and felt her heart race as she touched it, memories of her 
private viewing flowing back into her mind. She took the video with her 
into the den, and stood numbly in the passage, watching as Kasumi laid 
there, peaceful and beautiful.

&quot;Umm...you know, it&#39;s strange,&quot; she murmured, hiding the film behind her 
back. &quot;They were showing the old Adam West Batman and a movie I already 
owned.&quot; Kasumi looked up at her, impressed and surprised. Felicity was 
so timid and private; she wasn&#39;t expecting this outburst.

&quot;Oh? You have a copy of Sappho&#39;s Diner?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot; She timorously showed her roommate the video, and Kasumi 
scooted closer, gingerly reaching out for it.

&quot;Can I see?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; She took it and read the back, then smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen it 
before. Is it any good?&quot;

&quot;Uh...yeah, I guess.&quot;

It only changed my life.

&quot;Cool. D&#39;you think we could watch it together? I could make some more 
popcorn if you want.&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Kasumi rolled up off the floor and walked to the cabinet, where 
she pulled out a large bowl and two bags of popcorn.

&quot;It&#39;s no trouble,&quot; she said, smiling gently, &quot;and since you missed it, 
and I want to see it, and I don&#39;t have the heart to send you away, and 
I&#39;m sort of...in the mood for some company, I just figured... Anyway, 
this is really good popcorn. Do you want the couch or the chair?&quot;

We can both share the couch.

Kasumi had never opened up like this before. She must&#39;ve been in a very 
friendly mood. Felicity had never been this open, either. She must&#39;ve 
been desperate for a change.

I wish I could have seen this with Valencia and Nadia.

&quot;Um, we can both take the couch,&quot; she blurted. &quot;I mean, if you don&#39;t 
mind.&quot;

&quot;It would be easier to hold our popcorn on the armrests,&quot; Kasumi 
figured. She couldn&#39;t help but feel a warmth growing inside of her as 
she sat down next to her roommate, a bowl for each of them, and turned 
the lights off so they could watch the movie. She had a crush on the 
younger woman, but she didn&#39;t want to feel guilty about it. She wanted 
to like Felicity...and she really wanted Felicity to like her back.

It really was a good movie.
