<p>VOLUME EIGHT: THE FIELD OF ARBOL</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Distant Pluto: the homeworld of Dr. Miracle”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Ever since the crew drew lots to determine which of  their cooks would cover which shifts, Kate Shepherd had gotten a  little grumpier every day. She was unlucky enough to draw the  earliest shift, and that meant she had to wake up before anyone else  and get the kitchen ready. Although she had grown more competent when  it came to culinary works, she never meant to cook for large crowds  and <em>never</em> liked getting up before nine, not even when she had  been on the run. At least she was in good company: although Allegra  did not share her bed yet, she did pitch in with the chores, and  greeted Kate warmly when she entered the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Hello there! You look like you could use a  pick-me-up.”</p>
<p>“Several,” she groaned. After splashing her face  with cold water and eating an energy bar, she felt a little better,  and started preparing dishes. Fortunately for her, most of the other  women shared he sleeping habits, so there were not many people who  actually came to breakfast. In fact, the dining room was completely  abandoned except for the two cooks and two guests who were chatting  quietly. Kate was surprised when she recognized them.</p>
<p>“Hey! Riene, Rebecca, hi! I haven’t seen you two in  ages! How have you been? I thought you two left the ship and eloped!”</p>
<p>“Nothing as dramatic as that,” Riene chuckled. “We  just needed some time to…well, to think things over. There were a  lot of things that we needed to clear out and put into the open.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” That didn’t really answer anything, but…  “Well, it’s good to see you again. What’ll you have?”</p>
<p>“I’d really like some toast, eggs, bacon, and a  cantaloupe.”</p>
<p>“Can you make me blueberry waffles?” Rebecca said.</p>
<p>“Can I make you waffles!” Allegra replied starkly.  “Hon, you just sit back and watch a master at work. Waffles are my  specialty!”</p>
<p>“Allegra certainly knows her way around southern  American Earth cuisine,” Kate replied. She winked at her  girlfriend; Allegra kissed her cheek softly, revitalizing the  muscular woman. Rebecca blushed at their public display of affection,  and smiled.</p>
<p>“So do you two ladies need to get caught up on  current events? We’re headin’ to the Helios system if ya didn’t  know.”</p>
<p>“It would be nice if we knew what was going on. We  mostly stayed in my room and talked. I mean, we ate and took baths,  too— I mean, not <em>together</em>, of course— I mean, we certainly <em>ate</em> together, but— ”</p>
<p>“I think they know what you mean, Becky,” Riene  smiled, squeezing her hand. Kate noticed that the two women were a  lot more open and personal with each other, a trait they had skirted  around for far too long. She was overjoyed that they were finally  connecting, even on such a small level. But then again, if there was  hope for <em>her</em>, then there was hope for anybody! Allegra and  Kate alternated their reports, briefly going over the worlds they had  visited and the people they met ever since that terrible ordeal with  Rebecca’s father.</p>
<p>“So there’s been a trend,” Riene noted once they  concluded. “You’ve been making your way to everybody’s  homeworld, and now you’re going to Pluto, which is where Amy was  born. I’m a natural Tellurian, you know, and if I’m not mistaken,  you and Eve are, too.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, honey. It’ll be nice seeing the  Earth again. Do you have family there”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she sighed forlornly. “I’m a little  anxious about it. They’re…well, they’re not bad people, but I  can’t help but feel suffocated when I’m around them. They weren’t  very supportive of my decision to go into space.”</p>
<p>“Traditionalists?” Kate said.</p>
<p>“In the purest sense,” she chuckled darkly. “What  about you, Allegra?”</p>
<p>“Just two kids,” she murmured wistfully. Everyone  looked surprised except Kate, who already knew.</p>
<p>“Really? I had no idea you were a mother.”</p>
<p>“Yup, but not a very fit one. I mean, when my husband  passed on, I couldn’t provide for them. I just…left them  somewhere and tried to…uh…well, I don’t really wanna talk about  it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to open up old  wounds.”</p>
<p>“It was another time and another life,” she  replied, approaching them with their meal. “Welp, as the French  say, ‘<em>bon appetit</em>’! Becky, I gotta say this before the  day’s over: your wings are gorgeous! Ya almost look like an angel!”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she smiled feebly. “I like them too.”  She and Riene held hands for a moment, then focused on their  breakfast. Kate and Allegra exchanged a hopeful expression before  returning to work. Rush hour was upon them.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Thanks to decades of advancement in space exploration  technology, areas like the Oort Cloud and the Kuiper Belt were no  more dangerous than flecks of dust. The <em>Dauntless</em> pierced  through the Helios System’s barriers in a few days and soon spotted  Pluto, that distant, frozen, bizarre world of mystery. Early in the  twenty-first century, a debate had risen concerning Pluto’s status  in the immense system— whether it could actually be called a planet  or not— but even after half a millennium, pundits still  affectionately classified it as the ninth major heavenly body from  the sun. Amy Miracle simply called it her Home.</p>
<p>Of course, because it was a dead hunk of rock and ice  with no breathable atmosphere, life could not normally exist there.  Colonists had to construct artificial domes in order to contain and  sustain civilization, and even then, the only people that lived there  were miners, construction workers, a handful of scientists, and a  small civilian population. Pluto was simply too far away from the  other planets to justify creating a real culture there, but somehow  they had gotten by. Amy had not seen her home since a few months  before the voyage began, so it would be nice to rest there before  journeying to Earth.</p>
<p>“My father is a Kuiper Belt researcher, and up until  three years ago, my mother conducted reports alongside him. I managed  to get hold of them and tell them we were coming, so we should be  expecting a warm welcome.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any other family?” Rebecca asked. Amy  smiled sadly.</p>
<p>“An aunt on my father’s side, but she never  married, and a second cousin I only met a few times. My mother is an  only child, and all of my grandparents have passed on. I had a little  brother once, but he didn’t…make it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“It was a long time ago,” she beamed. “I was  barely a child myself. You know, I was really afraid for them when I  went off to college. It wasn’t like on Earth, where distance isn’t  such a problem: there’s a large chunk of space between Pluto and  Mars. But that was the closest school I could find.”</p>
<p>“What about the other planets? Helios has…uh, nine,  right?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm, but the four largest are gas worlds. There  are outposts on some of the moons, but nothing you could call a  civilization. Helios is simply too large for people to be so far away  from each other.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, I’d heard it was one of the biggest. So have  you ever been to Gaea?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid not,” she laughed. “Can you  imagine, a human never setting foot on Earth? I have visited the  moon, though— I mean Selene, the Earth’s moon. And I’ve been to  Venus.”</p>
<p>“That’s impossible,” Riene muttered. “No living  creature has ever set foot there.”</p>
<p>“That’s not really true, although I can’t prove  it. You’ll just have to believe me.”</p>
<p>“Oh? So what was it like?”</p>
<p>“You might get the chance to see,” she answered  mysteriously. Riene rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Whatever. I think I’ll go with you to see what  Pluto is like. It’s about time I get off the ship and stretch my  legs. Are you coming, Becky?”</p>
<p>“If you can accommodate me,” she answered.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t be a problem. Their house is a little  small, but most of us should fit.”</p>
<p>“If they have something against lesbians, I’m  staying here,” Kate grunted.</p>
<p>“Oh no, of course not. They may be religious but  they’re not discourteous.”</p>
<p>“Hmph, really? My experience says otherwise.” Amy  smiled at her lovingly.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate you had such a bad experience,  but not all religious people are like that. They’ll be glad to have  you in their house.”</p>
<p>“I hope so,” she muttered. Since Pluto was so  small, there was only one spaceport, and Amy begged the Acheron  sisters to behave themselves as they descended. Nobody wanted a  repeat of last time.</p>
<p>“But isn’t this ship already registered? It should  still be in their system.”</p>
<p>“No, I acquired it after I left Pluto— on Venus,  actually.”</p>
<p>“Sure, why not?” Riene shrugged doubtfully. Once  the <em>Dauntless</em> was docked and officially recorded in the  Plutonian system, Amy stepped out first and led the way. Since her  father was a researcher, the Miracles lived very close to the  spaceport; the crew wouldn’t even need to rent a cab.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“You’re right: it is a small house.” Rebecca’s  comment drew a smile from Amy; she couldn’t help but agree.</p>
<p>“The only people who live there are my parents, so  it’s not like they need anything bigger. Come on— we might be  able to make it there for lunch! Mother makes an excellent soup and  pasta.”</p>
<p>“Not so fast, you’ll strain yourself,” Fuuka  sighed. She knew her warning would go unheeded: Amy was too excited  to pay attention to her injury. Her cane barely even touched the  ground as she crossed the artificial turf and garden, knocking at the  front door. A plain-looking woman in her mid-fifties greeted them,  shoving her head through the door to stare questionably. She had  vague but kind eyes, her hair was more grey than brown, and she had  several age marks that, while certainly unflattering, made her look  mature and wise. She had a breathy, distant voice, and her eyes  shifted as she squinted at her visitors.</p>
<p>“Umm…excuse me, but I don’t believe we were  expecting visitors today.”</p>
<p>“Why not ask your husband?” Amy said patiently. The  woman turned her head and called for him; a slightly younger man came  to the door, smiling honestly. He took his wife’s hand and led her  away from the door.</p>
<p>“Mona, do you remember the call we received three  days ago? It said we should be expecting somebody.”</p>
<p>“I do!” she exclaimed, smiling brightly. She  returned to her guests and flung the door open. “I’m sorry, I  must’ve been too busy to remember. Come in, and welcome! Well,  there certainly are a lot of you, but whoever you are, we’re glad  to have you!”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” her husband replied. He gave Amy a warm  hug and kissed her forehead. “Did you have a safe journey?”</p>
<p>“Nope, not at all!” she grinned. “But it was  certainly a <em>good</em> one.”</p>
<p>“Ah, good, those are the best. Come on in, everybody:  don’t be shy. I’m afraid we didn’t expect this large a crowd,  so lunch might be delayed.”</p>
<p>“Uh, don’t worry about it.” Unlike the jilted  woman that had greeted them, Amy’s father— for these were her  parents— still had a youthful expression, though his face was also  grave and careful, and he had a full, flowing beard, reminiscent of  the kings of old. He had quite a powerful build but was very gentle  around his two “special ladies”; his wife came in and extended as  much hospitality as she could.</p>
<p>“Is this everybody? What a size! Darling, did I put  something in the oven?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you have a casserole going. I’m going to help  you out later, so don’t worry about not having enough.”</p>
<p>“I can always count on you,” she beamed. She turned  to Amy and smiled at her— not as a mother, but as a woman who is  meeting someone they can only remember from a dream. “Pardon me,  but who did you say you were again?”</p>
<p>“Look in Section 1, file 2,” she answered  patiently, pointing to a large computer terminal. Amy’s mother  slowly clicked the proper file, and lit up as information about her  daughter came to life before her eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s right! Amy!” The two women embraced,  now officially reunited. “I’m so sorry, darling: it’s been such  a long time since I’ve seen you! Goodness, you’ve changed! You’re  so thin, dear— and you still have that injury.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I’ve been doing all right. I made several  new friends.”</p>
<p>“I can see that! Well, this is a change! You used to  be so boy-crazy when you were young. Is that right, dear?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but she only had one serious boyfriend— that  Ozmund fellow. Fine man.”</p>
<p>“That’s right!” she exclaimed, slapping her palms  together. “I almost forgot! Oh, Amy, I <em>liked</em> him. But it’s  great to see you finally made some lady friends. And they’re all so  different! You must’ve combed the entire galaxy to find them!”</p>
<p>“Sort of,” she giggled. She could feel the stares  of her crew, so she decided to explain what was going on. “About  three years ago, my mother and I were in an accident together. I  escaped all right, but she suffered from partial memory loss. We  decided to record everything we could in that computer over there,”  she gestured, “so she wouldn’t forget.”</p>
<p>“That’s awful,” Fuuka whispered.</p>
<p>“It isn’t so bad!” Mrs. Miracle smiled. Mother  and daughter had the same cheerful expression, but she clearly  inherited her father’s willpower and integrity. “As long as I  have this computer and my husband to help me, I get along fine.  Besides, I haven’t seen Amy in awhile, so you can’t blame me for  not recognizing her.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you introduce us to everybody?” her  father suggested. “Lunch won’t be for awhile, and I’d like to  know where you found these ladies.”</p>
<p>“Oh, of course.” First, her parents: Marshall and  Mona Miracle. Presenting the crew was a more daunting task, however,  but her mother faithfully wrote everything down in her computer so  she wouldn’t forget.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a beautiful one!” she said to  Rebecca. “You have such radiant wings. You’re almost like a  dove!”</p>
<p>“Maybe more like an angel,” she murmured wryly.</p>
<p>“Oh no, don’t be silly,” Mona replied seriously.  “Angels look nothing like their pop culture depictions. People with  wings and <em>angels</em> are two completely different beings. I should  know; I’ve seen two.”</p>
<p>“You’ve seen angels?” Mona nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>“Not in their true forms, of course, but even I could  never forget an experience like that. Real angels are more like  macro-organic entities composed of a material that is beyond all  scope of perception and measurement. They are…oh, how can I put  this best? It’s difficult to describe unless you’ve seen them  yourself, and that’s very difficult to do since they exist outside  of time and space. Our time and their time moves so differently that  they appear distorted to us people, if they appear at all. But you  can tell if you’re quiet and if you look in the right spot. Just  don’t expect them to follow <em>our</em> whims.”</p>
<p>“The lady’s a basket-case,” Naja grumbled.  “There’s no such thing as angels. It’s just a fairy tale for  children.”</p>
<p>“Most fairy tales have a deep root in reality,”  Marshall answered. His face had that look which suggested perfect  seriousness, the kind a doctor might have when proposing a risky  operation. “But maybe we should be moving on.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Amy said. It was some time before she  wrapped everything up: father and mother interrupted frequently to  ask everyone a few questions, mostly about their origin and their  relationship with their daughter. At last the whole crew had been  called, and the Miracles felt weary, but relieved.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget us, little lady!” called a  familiar, masculine voice from across the house. Amy instantly knew  who it was and hobbled as fast as she could to the source.</p>
<p>“KYLE!!!” She crashed into him and they laughed; it  was the young founder and CEO of the Ozmund company.</p>
<p>“Her lover, right?” Sharyn whispered.</p>
<p>“Apparently so,” Athena shrugged. Mona Miracle  looked confused for a moment.</p>
<p>“Amy, did you get married to someone while you were  away?”</p>
<p>“No, mother!” she laughed, still clinging to her  friend. “This is Kyle, remember? Goodness sakes, mom, how could you  forget him so easily if he’s been here this whole time?”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she groaned sheepishly. “All these  people and names confused me.”</p>
<p>“You’re like two peas in a pod!” Kyle exclaimed.  Poor Amy grumbled helplessly. Marshall smiled and put his hand on  Kyle’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“He and his sister decided to pay us a visit during  their vacation. They’ve also been kind enough to help your mother  while I was at work.”</p>
<p>“That was sweet of you!” she grinned.</p>
<p>“Meh, t’weren’t nothing. I’m used to caring for  you Miracle women.”</p>
<p>“Not very nice,” she mumbled again. Mona laughed  beautifully, without restraint or inhibition.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, that’s right. Kyle’s your lover, isn’t  he? Didn’t you say you’d get married to him?”</p>
<p>“We’re sort of putting that on hold, mother,” Amy  said as she separated from her friend. “You might want to take a  closer look at our files. So Keiko’s here, too?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, helping your dad out. You already know about  this, but I’d better warn the rest of you: don’t eat anything  Keiko offers you. That woman should not be anywhere <em>near</em> a  kitchen.”</p>
<p>“I heard that!” she exclaimed. “I am getting  better, you know!”</p>
<p>“Show me some proof, Keiko!” he called back. A  discomforting silence followed; Mona Miracle stood up and excused  herself so she could tend to the kitchen.</p>
<p>“Why don’t the rest of you make yourselves at  home?” Marshall suggested as he joined his wife. “Lunch should be  ready soon. Amy, you’re free to do as you please.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to discuss something with Keiko and Kyle  before I join you,” she said. Her father gave her leave and she  promised to return once her conversation was over. Those that had  been on New Avalon when Amy made her startling revelation had a  suspicious feeling that this wasn’t just a “friendly”  get-together.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Do you need any help, Mrs. Miracle?” Mink, Kate,  Fuuka, and Chandra decided to go into the kitchen to see if they  could be of any use, and Amy’s mother smiled warmly at their  kindness.</p>
<p>“No, I can manage. My husband and I usually don’t  eat that much. Wait— are you guests?”</p>
<p>“Yes ma’am, we came here with your daughter.”</p>
<p>“That’s right!” she exclaimed as her face lit up.  “Oh, I’m so sorry, I’ve already forgotten! There were just so  many of you— and now it looks as though there won’t be enough.”</p>
<p>“That’s why we’re here, ma’am,” Mink replied.  Mona beamed and welcomed their assistance, and in no time at all she  had made four new friends. They quickly figured out where Amy learned  most of her tolerance and love from: despite how unique they were  (both in appearance and character), Mona Miracle thought nothing of  it, and treated them all like close friends. Kitsune, Yun,  Heavyworlder, pleasure unit…it made no difference to her. She  wasn’t even bothered by their sexuality.</p>
<p>“A fox and a rabbit? How sweet! Oh yes, I remember  her. She looks very strong and trustworthy. And Kate, that nice lady  from the south is your… Hmm, you know, I always liked southerners.  I actually had the pleasure of working alongside a few back in my  youth. What about you two?”</p>
<p>“I’m…single,” Mink replied.</p>
<p>“Nothing wrong with that,” Mona gestured. “You’re  all still very young. Perhaps it’s best if you enjoy these moments  by yourself. And what about you, dear? I forgot what a pleasure unit  does, but I’m sure you’re quite popular.”</p>
<p>“Um, yes, in some circles. I actually…” Chandra  stuttered and froze; she was still struggling with what Amy had told  her several weeks ago. “We’re designed for sexual pleasure,  ma’am. Apparently I was made to give this to women only.”</p>
<p>“That’s a strange occupation,” she said  curiously. “I mean, I know sometimes a lady needs some ‘me time’,  but don’t you ever feel like you could act that way with just one  person?”</p>
<p>“That’s the problem, ma’am. Your daughter  suggested I’d be incapable of loving just one person, and now I’m  afraid she’s right. I’ve been this way for so long, and I’ve  enjoyed it so much that I never stopped to really <em>think</em> about  what I was doing.”</p>
<p>“Well, you don’t strike me as a bad person,” Mona  replied softly. “And it seems my daughter really cares about you.  She wouldn’t have bothered otherwise. Have you ever <em>tried</em> to  focus your attention on just one person?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I could!” she insisted, almost  cutting her finger off with the knife. She sucked on the scratch and  got a band-aid from Fuuka. “For one, I don’t feel that way about  anybody. I’m in lust with just about everybody on the ship, but I  could never see myself staying with them any longer than necessary.  Second of all, even if I try, my instincts will just go haywire  whenever I see another pretty face. I’m incapable of commitment.”  Chandra was startled to feel tears rolling down her face: she didn’t  think she was remorseful enough, or even human enough for them. But  what really surprised her was when Mona took her in her arms and held  her. She had never felt such pure love before— love without reason  or question, without rules or boundaries, without definition or  identification. Chandra shuddered and let the tears go.</p>
<p>“If you want it, you can have it. It’s as simple as  that. But you must work for it. Whenever you love someone, you will  always face adversity. And when that happens, you have two options:  either quit on them, or love them even more. And I love my husband  and daughter more than anything.”</p>
<p>“But it’s not that simple,” she murmured. Mona  grinned.</p>
<p>“It’s only like that because you want it to be  complicated. But real love isn’t hard to figure out. I may not  remember everything very clearly, but I do know my daughter had to  learn that lesson the hard way. You may not believe this, but she  used to have difficulty loving people— at least in <em>that</em> way.  I remember…yes, at one point, she was a little bit like you. It  seemed like she had a different boyfriend every week, and…you know,  I think she lost her virginity when she was very young— as an  impulse, not as an act of love. Now if she had given it to Kyle, I  wouldn’t have been so upset. She only changed her ways when she  went to college on Mars. That was before I got that nasty knock on  the head. Anyway, judging from the letters I saved, she stopped being  so frivolous and became serious about her relationships. But I never  recall her loving people with such strength and conviction  until…well, it might have been the last time she visited, before  she started her journey. Amy moved from sex to romance to love; she  was changed again and again, and she suffered, but she grew  stronger.”</p>
<p>Everyone had stopped cooking, resulting in complete  silence. They didn’t mean to eavesdrop, of course, but they were in  close quarters with Mother Miracle, and they were more than curious  about their friend’s history. They couldn’t help it.</p>
<p>“I…never knew,” Chandra croaked.</p>
<p>“None of us did,” Mink replied, tasting her stew.  “Amy’s too humble to talk about herself.”</p>
<p>“Just as I figured, the key to happiness is sacrifice  and suffering,” Kate murmured. Fuuka silently nodded in agreement.  Chandra groaned.</p>
<p>“Just perfect.”</p>
<p>“But only if you want it,” Mona said, letting her  go. “Now please, let’s talk about something more pleasant. Why  don’t you girls tell me something about yourselves? Amy never had  that many lady-friends.”</p>
<p>“Something <em>pleasant</em>? About <em>us</em>?” Kate  turned to stare grimly at Fuuka. The Kitsune shrugged helplessly.</p>
<p>“I guess that means I’ll start,” Mink said.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“So how is everything going?” Kyle began. “Aside  from that time at the Race, it’s been a long time since we’ve  seen you.”</p>
<p>“A lot has happened since then,” Amy said. She  removed her glasses, rubbed her eyes, and sat back as Keiko untied  her braids. “To be honest, I never knew adventures could be so  taxing. It’s thanks to all my friends that I was able to make it  this far. I’m amazed so many of them decided to stay with me.”</p>
<p>“What can we say, you’re an attractive person.”</p>
<p>“Only sometimes,” she smiled. “I’m sure many of  them are in it for the treasures and the thrills. Speaking of which,  we’ve amassed quite a few. And…we’ve run into people that work  for <em>them</em>.”</p>
<p>“Besides that Pyrosian, you mean.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Lyara, that fair-skinned elf, said that someone  she knew on Avatar was on their side, and Rebecca— that  white-haired woman with wings— her father was working for them as  well. They also have entities composed of fog, assuming the shape of  stealth warriors.”</p>
<p>“We’ve heard reports of their existence,” Kyle  said. “I actually fought a handful. I’m assuming they were  scouting for company secrets.”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, whatever became of your space  pirate problem? Did you go ahead and invite that person you mentioned  to help you?” Kyle crossed his arms and made a face.</p>
<p>“I had a gut feeling it would only lead to trouble,  so we decided to refuse his offer and hold back on development. It  might hurt business, but it also might work for the better in the  long run.”</p>
<p>“I already told you what Lord Demise and Clarissa  said, right?” Keiko said. Amy nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s a difficult situation you’re in, but I’m  sure you’ll do the right thing. Anyway, we’ll be heading to Gaea  soon, and then we’ll be going to our <em>real</em> destination.”</p>
<p>“Venus,” Keiko whispered. “Is it time?”</p>
<p>“Not for awhile. I’m calculating we’ll make at  least one major stop before we reach Gaea, and since so many of our  crew were born there, we might stay for awhile. I’m sure it’ll be  time once we arrive.”</p>
<p>“Do ya think anybody will come with you?” Kyle  murmured. “I mean, the general consensus is that Venus is a living  Hell. In all the centuries we’ve been exploring and colonizing, not  one single person has ever set foot there— as far as society is  concerned, anyway.”</p>
<p>“I certainly won’t force them,” she replied. A  cheerful smile spread on her face as she said, “Don’t worry! I  managed by myself before, right?”</p>
<p>“But that was before you received your injury,”  Keiko indicated.</p>
<p>“Wounds don’t mean anything there,” she replied  serenely. “Once I get used to the terrain again, I’ll be walking  normally. It’ll be a good chance to exercise my legs for once!”</p>
<p>“Well, we can’t stop you,” Kyle grunted. “Just  be careful, all right? You have a tendency to get into trouble.”</p>
<p>“I’ve learned <em>that</em> the hard way,” she  chuckled feebly.</p>
<p>“And what do you think you’ll do once you leave  Venus? Will it be <em>that</em> time yet?”</p>
<p>“No…there’s still a few pieces missing. I feel a  little awful about lying to them, but if they knew what they were  really getting those treasures for, do you think they’d still  follow my selfish whims? Especially if they knew how dangerous they  were?”</p>
<p>“We certainly would,” Keiko answered, smiling  warmly. “It’s just a pity we can’t be pulled away even for  that. As far as the rest of society is concerned, it’s business as  usual.”</p>
<p>“Whatever you can give me is wonderful enough. I’m  surprised you managed to take <em>this</em> much time off. Really, I  can’t thank you enough for helping my mother.”</p>
<p>“Hey, no sweat!” Kyle grinned, rubbing his hair  sheepishly. “If everything goes well, she might just end up being  our mother-in-law!”</p>
<p>“Speaking of which,” Amy squeaked, fluffing her  hair freely. She blushed and played with her fingers. “Uh, look, I  know we made a promise, but…you know…it’s been a whole year  since we…uh, you know…so I was wondering if…”</p>
<p>“You mean you wanna get <em>laid</em>?” Kyle blurted.  Amy’s face glowed red, and she nodded enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“I know we made a promise, but I’m <em>really— </em>”</p>
<p>“You’re something else, ya know that!” he  laughed. Kyle ruffled her hair and kissed the poor woman’s  forehead. “Right now, I’d rather have that casserole your mother  made.”</p>
<p>“I figured you’d say that,” she squeaked in  defeat. “You’re right, of course: we should keep to our word.  Still.” Kyle laughed again and Keiko ribbed her.</p>
<p>“Don’t look so glum, sweetie. Why not experiment  with one of your new friends?”</p>
<p>“Hey, I put women on that ship so I <em>wouldn’t</em> be tempted! Don’t encourage me to do <em>that</em> again!”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she giggled. “I was just teasing you  anyway. Oh, but speaking of casseroles, do you smell that?” The  trio put their noses to the air and hummed for joy.</p>
<p>“Mmm, that’s a good smell. See, Keiko, that’s how  the experts do it.”</p>
<p>“I really have gotten better,” she grumbled.</p>
<p>“I’ll believe it when I taste it!” he said,  rising to his feet. They made their way to the kitchen, announcing  they had finished their conversation. Amy got a lot of peculiar looks  when she emerged, especially since she wasn’t wearing her glasses  or her hair in braids, but her mother claimed it was an improvement.</p>
<p>“You look mature and more ladylike. Why did you ever  wear those pigtails in the first place?”</p>
<p>“Because you liked them so much,” she answered  stiffly. Mona was stricken and apologized.</p>
<p>“Looks like I need to read that profile more.”</p>
<p>“Like I said,” Kyle murmured. Amy grumbled and  wished people would stop picking on her.</p>
<p>“All right, it’s time to eat,” Marshall  announced. Things calmed down a little and the Ozmunds took seats  around the Miracle family table. Marshall gestured for Amy’s  crewmembers and said, “Come here, don’t be shy! You’re our  honored guests! Make yourselves at home! I hear four of you ladies  helped make this meal. Tell me a bit about yourselves.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>For a self-proclaimed prodigal, Amy Miracle didn’t  stay at her parents’ house very long. She gave herself a full day  and a half to rest there and catch up with her family and friends,  then declared that “it would be best if I left soon. Wouldn’t  want to test my crew’s patience, now!”</p>
<p>“Don’t say that,” Lil grumbled. “At least you <em>have</em> family, and they seem pretty nice. You should stay for as  long as you like.”</p>
<p>“I really do have to be on my way,” she replied  firmly. Her father agreed; he seemed to know his daughter’s  schedule better than her crew.</p>
<p>“We have no right to keep her here. Our daughter’s  future is elsewhere; we are merely a means to that end. The time for  her to rest shall come soon, but for right now, she will follow the  path of the drifter, as shall you all.”</p>
<p>“That’s profound,” Kyrie murmured.</p>
<p>“So just where will this path take us, drifter?”  Aseria asked her. Amy fixed her glasses and clumsily tried to redo  her braids.</p>
<p>“Earth will be our first major destination, then we  push on to Venus. I do not think the other planets will hold anything  of interest for us.”</p>
<p>“We could visit my old alma mater on Mars,” Alala  suggested.</p>
<p>“Or we could go to the Moon,” Riene said. Both  women had private reasons for deviating the course and would not  explain themselves. Amy suggested it would be a “possibility”,  and prepared for the departure, but her hair delayed her.</p>
<p>“Honestly, now,” Chandra sighed as she volunteered  for the honors (styling hair, whether it be her own or a lover’s,  was evidently in her dossier as well). “I don’t even know why you  bother. Either keep them braided or keep them loose.”</p>
<p>“I’d really prefer to keep them loose,” Amy  confessed. “You know, it’s funny. My mother fussed about my hair  when I was young. She said it looked better all braided up in  pigtails. I never liked it; I always thought it was childish. I only  started wearing it like this after her accident. I felt that…it  would help her remember me easier. I’m afraid now it’s become a  habit.”</p>
<p>“Is that a fact,” she murmured (Mink smiled as she  overheard this. So, even the humble could not resist talking about  themselves!). “And your glasses?”</p>
<p>“<em>Reading </em>glasses,” she chuckled. “I don’t  really need them. Another habit. Besides, I don’t really look the  part of a doctor without them.”</p>
<p>“So you can be vain! Well, your outfit  notwithstanding.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>“I’d have to agree!” her mother called. “If you  can’t dress yourself properly, dear, at least come over here and  say goodbye! Your pleasure friend can play with you later!”  Everybody snickered at Mona’s unintentional slip, except for Amy,  of course. Nobody saw or heard what she did around her parents, but  they assumed it was heartwarming. She merely waved at the Ozmunds,  presuming she would see them much sooner than her relatives. Mona and  Marshall waved at them until the <em>Dauntless</em> was less than a  speck in the dark sky; she tried not to weep too much.</p>
<p>“They were such lovely girls, weren’t they? I’m  glad we had a chance to meet. Oh, darling, don’t ever let me forget  them!”</p>
<p>“Just keep to your studies,” he pointed. Then, he  smiled warmly at Kyle, and drew closer to him. Already Marshall  thought of him as a son-in-law; he seemed the person most capable of  caring for his scatterbrained offspring. “So there she goes, and no  telling when either of us will see her again. You will protect her  when you can, right?”</p>
<p>“You can count on me, sir,” he swore. Marshall  smiled and clapped his shoulder.</p>
<p>“I know I can, son.”</p>
<p>“Son?! It’s a little too early to be calling me  that!” He rubbed his neck bashfully, and soon the Ozmund twins made  their departure. Now began the long time of waiting for Marshall and  Mona: like a fruit with a very thick shell, and the joy of their next  meeting with their daughter was its sweet, but the rind was thick,  thick with more time than any of them could measure.</p>
