Kimagure Gakuen

&quot;I hope you&#39;ll like it too. I&#39;m sure a couple of people will 
badmouth the school to you but I wouldn&#39;t listen to those guys. 
We&#39;ll have to miss the first period so I can show you around the 
school grounds. Come on, quick now.&quot;

Yui gripped the handle of her book bag and daintily followed 
after her class superior, Haruko, keeping up as she led through 
the gates of Kimagure Gakuen. The following half-hour was spent 
with Haruko, touring all over the school. The newest student was 
shown all the ropes around the place. How to get to all of her 
classes, the people to avoid, the people best to make friends 
with. Most important of all; Yui was shown the full layout of 
the school. The four main buildings were divided up into 
departments which were further divided by each separate 
classroom within them. Those four subdivisions were Humanities 
(History, Sociology, Psychology), Fundamentals (English, Math, 
etc) Sciences (Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Geology) and last 
but not least, Computers and Media. Which was where Kimagure 
Gakuen seemed to shine most. By the time that Haruko went 
through half the tour, they were walking along the stone path 
that curled around the circular main garden that adorned the 
front half of the school. Haruko spouted gabs and gabs of 
information about Kimagure. Mostly about the teachers and which 
of them were the most capable. Sometimes there was talk about 
the founding fathers of the school. And though Yui really didn&#39;t 
want to seem rude; she doubted that she needed to be told about 
any of that to settle into this school. But Haruko was the class 
rep; she would surely know best. And there was the added benefit 
of Haruko&#39;s cuteness, something Yui had no qualms in enjoying 
from a little distance. Haruko marched forwards and pointed at 
each little detail that she believed Yui needed to know about. 
While Yui herself just sort of nodded along, not really taking 
any notice on Haruko&#39;s part. 

But her mind re-focused on something else. Yui kept walking 
behind Haruko, but her mind abruptly became alert. A tremble 
passed down her spine. Her senses suddenly began kick starting. 
And she knew what that meant. Yui&#39;s normally innocent face 
darkened with a frown. There was another Shinobi nearby. But she 
couldn&#39;t look around. That would give her away. Haruko kept 
talking in front of Yui. While the younger woman kept up the 
pace, she remained cautious. And that caution was more than 
warranted. A dark spark set in through Yui&#39;s mind which meant 
immediate danger. Acting on reflex, Yui took the initiative and 
ran ahead into Haruko. The class rep gave off a feminine yelp as 
Yui tumbled into her. What she could not have seen was the 
blurred flash of a weapon that whizzed straight by the two of 
them and spiked the cold stone of the ground. Yui&#39;s head tilted 
upwards as she lay on top of the startled Haruko. She looked up 
to one of the surrounding department buildings. High in that 
sunny, bluish sky; upon the highest point of the roof of the 
humanities department... was the shadow of a figure. He stood up 
with his arms crossed, his feet planted firmly on the railing of 
that building. There was no denying that he was a shinobi. And 
then Yui shot another serious look behind her. She saw a 
shuriken lodged into the ground. That was what that ninja had 
attacked with. Yui was furious. It was one thing to attack her, 
but do it in front of an innocent girl like that? Who did that 
bastard think he was messing with? The unknown ninja stood up 
above; watching Yui. Then jumped backwards. Right out of sight. 
But by this time, Yui wasn&#39;t the only one whom had lost her 
patience. 

&quot;Yui-san!&quot; Haruko bellowed, &quot;What is the matter with you?! Get 
off me!&quot;

&quot;Oh... uh... sorry...&quot;

Yui gave an awkward glance back down at her class rep. She 
peeled off the girl, standing upright. Haruko did the same and 
dusted herself off, patting off some of the dust that had been 
pressed into her short school skirt. 

&quot;Honestly...&quot; Haruko said with a huff, smoothing out her rumpled 
blue skirt, &quot;...What on earth did you do that for?&quot;

Yui nervously ran a hand through the back of her auburn hair, 
again blushing. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry, Haruko-san. I guess I must have 
slipped on something while we were walking. But could you excuse 
me for a moment? I have to use the restroom.&quot;

And with that last comment, Yui turned on her heels and sprinted 
away from Haruko down the long stone path that surrounded the 
grassy front gardens of this elite but un-hostile school. Haruko 
blinked. Had she even told Yui where the bathrooms were? 
Nonetheless, Yui dashed around the corner of the Humanities 
department building and opened her book bag. The green-eyed girl 
pulled out something. A facial mask. One that was enough to 
cover her face and nose flawlessly. While the remaining length 
was allowed to flow down her back like a scarf long enough to 
touch the ankles. Yui&#39;s expression darkened. Her sweet eyes 
thinned out into harsh ones. Her brown furrowed. And a grim 
scowl crossed her face. It was almost as if the sweet girl of 
Hazumaru Yui was... vanishing away for another persona...

She tied the facial mask around her mouth and nose, leaving the 
upper half of her face to view. Luckily she had brought most of 
her gear with her in the thought of having to deal with 
something like this. 

&quot;You might be able to frighten Hazumaru Yui...&quot; A shadowy 
chuckle escaped the girl&#39;s full pink lips as the mask settled 
over her face. &quot;But lets just see how you handle Shiki...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Shinrin Jinja

The Shinrin Jinja was not like other temples in Tokyo. Nor was 
it like any other ancient  building to have existed there. While 
the surrounding city; flooded with rampant technology and blunt 
westernisation, was relentlessly busy and public, Shinrin was 
quiet. Silent. It was adorned with adjoining gardens of freshly 
trimmed green grass and romantic cherry blossom tress. A large 
stone path cut straight through the centre of the front gardens 
and ran around the entire complex of the shrine. And a new 
measure of keeping outsiders away; was an elongated metal fence 
built of black-painted grates which had been forked into the 
soil of the outer gardens. With the combination of the security 
fence, the inner and outer gardens, the Shinrin Jinja was a 
gigantic yet archaic complex. It would take a normal person 
about fifteen minutes to reach the shrine doors from the shrine 
gates. The Shinrin Jinja had been built in the very centre of 
Tokyo. From an outside perspective, it was a beautiful home of 
spirit and soul. In itself; it was the centre of the Honshu 
Island&#39;s real power.  

It was no coincidence that this happened to be the very home of 
the Mizuryu Clan. 

Deep within its main halls and chambers, which had been solidly 
built with 17th Century Japanese architecture in mind; stood the 
guards and followers of the Mizuryu Clan. One of the four major 
ninja clans in all of Japan. The group that were under the 
direct command of Mizuryu Hirotsugu, the Honshu Koga.  They 
supported his power and held strong against the rising influence 
of the other three Koga. It was no secret that the Honshu Koga 
had the Lion&#39;s Share of the power base in this country. But 
those who worked for him were unwilling to lose that power to 
the other three Koga. Doing so would mean forfeiting their own 
power.

Towards the back of the innards of the Shinrin Jinja, was a 
sizeable room. Full of space and calmness. It was known as the 
Room of Fates. Aside from some great surrounding statues of 
ancient spiritual gods and the flame torches that kept the room 
alight, nothing else was there to decorate it. Even though 
decisions were made in that room that would determine the fate 
of millions of Japanese offspring. Right now it contained two 
people. Or more specifically, two shinobi. 

Setsuki leaned back on the frame of the left wall and curled his 
rosy pink lips into a knowing smile. &quot;Tell me, friend. Has 
Zanmaru-san gone to kill the girl? Like Yagami-sama has 
ordered?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot;  The younger Shinobi, standing to the centre of the room, 
kneeled downwards and ran a hand through his short blonde hair. 
Across his face was a Kabuki Cat Mask, &quot;He has. And knowing him; 
his zealousness is sure to get the job done. But... I am 
concerned. This action seems somewhat heavy handed. Sending one 
of us, The Six Orochi, to a high school to take down some rogue 
kunoichi? I don&#39;t think this girl is that big of an issue.&quot;

&quot;Well, she obviously holds sway in Hirotsugu-sama&#39;s mind,&quot; 
Setsuki pulled his left arm upwards while his back supported him 
against the wall. With him came a colourful red rose. He held it 
to his nostrils and absorbed the clear scent. Wonderful, &quot;We can 
only assume that our input is essential to our Lord&#39;s plans. And 
time is not on our side. After all... there are only five of us 
just as yet. The Sixth Orochi has not arrived. When that Shinobi 
comes... then we can begin. Then we can start everything that 
Hirotsugu-sama has shaped for us. But I suspect that does not 
concern you in this subject.&quot;

&#39;Cat Mask&#39; looked over at Setsuki, his brow furrowing. &quot;...What 
do you mean by that?&quot;

&quot;Just that... your concern is not for the success of 
Zanmaru-san. But more for the safety of your younger sibling. I 
believe that she attends Kimagure Gakuen, does she not?&quot;

Which was true. Something that Cat Mask could not and would not 
deny. It was probably the main reason that he didn&#39;t want the 
Mizuryu Clan or the Six Orochi anywhere near the school his 
sister attended. &quot;How did you know?&quot;

Setsuki slipped his soft sapphire eyes shut, cracking a smile. 
&quot;Emotions are like the scent of a rose, my friend. A lack of 
familiarity makes them hard to detect. But an affinity for the 
smell allows for quick knowledge. It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve never had a 
will to protect something special to me. But you must realize. 
Hirotsugu-sama will not tolerate this kind of compassion from 
you. We forsook that right when we all became members of the Six 
Orochi.&quot;

Cat Mask looked away from Setsuki. &quot;I know that. Emotions like 
caring and concern are useless to shinobi. Much less an Orochi 
like myself. But I can&#39;t turn my back on my flesh and blood, 
Setsuki-san. Doing so would make me devoid of my own humanity.&quot;

To that, Setsuki smiled again. &quot;You youngsters. You&#39;re too 
expressive. But I&#39;ll give you a hand in this case. Zanmaru-san 
can be counted on to overdo it. His blood thirst knows no 
bounds. So I&#39;ll head to Kimagure Gakuen to keep an eye on him.&quot;

Cat Mask nodded, smiling back. &quot;Thank you. I&#39;ll repay the favour 
someday.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve no need,&quot; Setsuki pushed himself off the wall he was 
leaning on and then walked forwards a little, his sandaled feet 
peering from the long length of his white and blue stripe 
hakama. He swiftly pulled his right hand up and made the 
two-fingered sign of the Shinobi. Right before a chorus of wind 
echoed around him. Cat Mask looked on at the slightly older 
fighter as a fierce wind overtook him. It surrounded Setsuki&#39;s 
body completely, allowing his long ponytail of jet black hair to 
rise upwards. That wind twirled sharply into itself; and 
vanished upwards. Setsuki disappeared. But left behind one last 
comment of his to ring in the echoing halls of Shinrin Jinja.

&quot;To be honest, my dear friend, I am intrigued by the severity 
with which Hirotsugu-sama wishes to see this girl dead. Such a 
kunoichi must be powerful. And I am looking forward to seeing 
that power for myself...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kimagure Gakuen

Zanmaru slid to a stop high above the school, standing silently 
on the stone paved roof of the humanities department. His 
mission today was to kill the girl whom had come to Tokyo from 
Morioka. And she was bound to show up at some point in time. 
Then he would slice her in two. The psychotic man walked up to 
the very edge of the building and pressed his foot into the 
metal safety railing that had been etched around it. He looked 
downwards to the main courtyard of the school without climbing 
the railing. The front of the school was deserted now. Everyone 
had made it to classes. Which would make it easier to take out 
the kunoichi.

A woman he was soon going to meet.

&quot;So, Hirotsugu-yarou wants me dead so badly he&#39;s willing to 
litter a school with his filthy shinobi bodyguards, eh? You 
couldn&#39;t have written &#39;scum&#39; anymore clearly over your face if 
you even tried.&quot;

Zanmaru shifted around at the sound of another voice. A female 
voice. His feet swung him around on their balls to see the girl. 
She stood across from him, besides one of the compact doors that 
lead inwards to the main building. As the wind picked up; her 
dark sandy brown hair soon flocked with it. As did the lengthy 
trail of her facial wrappings. But she had not donned the 
clothing of a shinobi. She stood in the garbs of a schoolgirl of 
Kimagure Gakuen. Not very smart. But they knew she had enrolled 
in this school anyway.

Zanmaru smiled behind his own facial wrappings, letting his thin 
arms lower to his waist. &quot;Not bad. You had the skill to sneak up 
on me. Without detection. But you wasted a great opportunity to 
strike me down with that childish bravado of yours. And that is 
a mistake that will cost you dearly, I assure you.&quot;

The girl made the two-fingered sign of the shinobi. &quot;I don&#39;t 
need sneak attacks to take out a scumbag like you. So what&#39;s 
your aim? Why bother attacking two defenceless girls like that?&quot;

Zanmaru smirked. &quot;Target practice. And a lure. I was sure that 
if you found those girls dead then you would come after me, 
miss...&quot;

&quot;In this form, you can refer to me as...&quot; The girl&#39;s eyes 
darkened, &quot;...Shiki...&quot;

Again, Zanmaru just smiled to this, not really taking her intent 
seriously. After all; he had a mission to fulfil here as well. 
The psycho-ninja lowered his hands all the way to a small pocket 
compartment at the side of his left thigh. Etched into the 
fabric of his garbs. His eyes thinned out as his finger hooked 
into something under the flap of the pocket. A shuriken. There 
was a flash of alertness within those darkening eyes of Shiki; 
but she didn&#39;t move a inch from her current position. Then 
Zanmaru acted. 

His whole body shifted forwards as he flung a sharp metal 
shuriken at Shiki. But it was no ordinary attack. While it 
swerved through the air, the shuriken exploded with a bright 
golden electrical energy. Writhing over its jagged edges. Shiki 
blinked furiously. This buffoon knew about Compound Ninjutsu 
techniques? Regardless; Shiki bounded to one side of the attack 
and slid opposite, her trainers grinding into the stone of the 
ground, waking the dust and friction. The shuriken lodged into 
the ground at the point at which Shiki once stood. Making 
Zanmaru watch her intently. 

&quot;You are very skilful when it comes to avoiding attacks,&quot; He 
yelled, the wind blowing once again behind the two of them, 
&quot;There aren&#39;t many ninja who can navigate their way around my 
Shuri-Rai (Shuri-Thunder) technique that easily. No wonder 
Hirotsugu-sama wants you dead.&quot;

Shiki stood upright. She was a lot more concerned with what 
Zanmaru had just done. &quot;...You must be one of the head cronies 
of the Honshu Koga. And that&#39;s how you know Compound Ninjutsu. 
The art of combining two sub-styles of Ninjutsu to produce even 
more devastating attacks. Like fusing the Weapon-based style of 
Shuri-jutsu (Art of Shuriken) with the Elementally Chi-based 
style of Inabikari-jutsu (Art of Lighting). Hirotsugu-yarou was 
the one who revolutionized that art.&quot;

Zanmaru smirked again, reaching back to both of his thighs. And 
the shuriken pockets that were made into them. &quot;Well now. You&#39;ve 
been doing your homework, haven&#39;t you? You have completely 
changed from that feeble girl I saw before.&quot;

&quot;...Yui-san is a weakling,&quot; Shiki replied, &quot;I am what you should 
be worried about.&quot;

And then Zanmaru deftly crouched forwards, spreading his feet 
apart. &quot;You give me your true name freely? Aren&#39;t you afraid 
that I&#39;ll reveal your real identity to Hirotsugu-sama?&quot;

Again, Shiki made that two-fingered sign of the shinobi. &quot;No. 
Because in just a few moments; the only ones you&#39;ll be 
whispering my name to... are the spirits.&quot;

&quot;Mighty sure of yourself, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Zanmaru then flung both 
arms forwards, throwing two electrically charged Shuriken at 
Shiki, &quot;Double Shuri-Rai Attack!&quot; 

That same move again. Shiki scowled at Zanmaru and jumped 
upwards. Her body moved like speedy blur; right up into the 
sunny skies above Kimagure Gakuen. The Shuri-Rai both went 
straight under her; through into the metal railing that was hung 
around the other side of this building&#39;s roof. Zanmaru scowled 
back at her. She was quick on her feet. Just like Cat Mask and 
Yagami. Not to worry. There was more to Zanmaru than just the 
throwing of regular shuriken. A secret he would soon share with 
Shiki. The psychotic ninja looked upward into the skies; keeping 
his eye trained on the younger girl. While his hand roped around 
to his back. To that gigantic curved-edge shuriken strapped to 
it. One that he had lovingly dubbed, Gyakusatsu (Slaughter).

&quot;Fool!&quot; He screamed to her, &quot;Do you think that jumping into the 
air will save you from my next assault? I am Zanmaru! The 
Lightning Shinobi! Master of the Art of Shuriken and Second of 
the Six Orochi! You shall die in the name of Hirotsugu-sama!&quot;

While midair, Shiki vaulted backwards. Her nimble body flipped 
through the air; over and over again; till it landed foot-first 
on the metal railing on the other side of the roof. Shiki 
mounted the railing in a crouched position; leaving one hand 
free while the other grabbed the steel. Whatever Zanmaru had 
planned; she was ready and willing to cope with it. The older 
man braced himself and pulled out that large shuriken he had 
strapped to his back. It was huge; and was over a metre in 
length from one opposite tip to the other. He pulled out the 
magnificent death star and held it in front of him from the 
small hole in its centre. Zanmaru grinned from behind his 
mouthpiece and shifted his body downwards; bracing all strength 
into the power of the throw. Shiki took note. But also of the 
bright golden glow that was surrounding Zanmaru&#39;s giant 
shuriken. Looked like he was capable of pushing his natural Chi 
element, electricity, into the weapon. Zanmaru then gave a 
fierce war cry as he swung his electrified shuriken around 
himself and then straight at Shiki. The charged-up death star 
moved like its natural lightning straight for the kunoichi. 
Shiki snorted at the attack and did the same as before. She 
jumped straight upwards in a brilliant blur of movement. 

The Kyoudai Shuri-Rai (Enormous Shuri-Thunder) technique was 
avoided. The large weapon ripped open the metal grid of the 
opposite railing, slicing through it; well out of Shiki&#39;s way. 
Not quite the result that Zanmaru was expecting; Shiki was sure 
of that much. While leaping upwards; Shiki looked down at the 
older shinobi. &quot;That wasn&#39;t your trump card, was it!? If it was 
then you&#39;ve signed your own death warrant by challenging me, 
Zanmaru-san!&quot;

Though Shiki couldn&#39;t hear it, Zanmaru was chuckling. &quot;Heh, heh, 
heh. Overconfidence. The downfall of the weak. You haven&#39;t even 
seen my true power yet, little girl. But now it&#39;s time to reveal 
it all. The Second Orochi cannot be defeated!&quot;

Zanmaru thrust both feet downwards and took a deep breath. He 
brought his hands together and performed a series of katas with 
both. His eyes slipped shut through the entire process. But it 
bore results. The Gyakusatsu, which had now been flung a good 
fifty metres away, was the centre of the action. It stopped its 
spinning midair and froze. Then that spinning resumed at an even 
faster rate. But in Zanmaru&#39;s direction. The Giant Shuriken 
altered its direction and returned to where it came from. It 
then span past the far metal railing then climbed upwards. Which 
put it in a direct course for Shiki. The brown-haired girl 
didn&#39;t notice this until it was too late. The rapidly spinning 
weapon came up in a speedy motion. The girl grunted as it sliced 
open the fabric over the arm of her school shirt, cutting open 
her arm. She gripped the wound swiftly and begun plummeting back 
down to earth from the loss of momentum of her jump. While the 
Lightning Shinobi; Zanmaru, grinned like a madman from behind 
his mouthpiece. The spinning giant shuriken stopped in the air 
again, hanging above in position, more than ready for Zanmaru&#39;s 
next command. 

Shiki managed to regain her composure, landing on the stone 
floor of the roof. She slipped one of her eyes closed while 
keeping the other on Zanmaru. &quot;...N-Not bad. You&#39;re a little 
better than I expected. I didn&#39;t think you could... control the 
Kyoudai Shuri-Rai as well as cast it.&quot;

Zanmaru giggled evilly. &quot;Imprudent girl. Did you actually 
believe that you could challenge a member of the Six Orochi and 
live? There are none who can. Your fate is death. By my hand. 
Those who stand against Hirotsugu-sama can expect nothing less.&quot;

And so Zanmaru began his next set of hand commands for the 
frozen-in-air Gyakusatsu. He looked up at it. The weapon soon 
began spinning again. It swung around in path and rotated 
backwards towards Shiki. The younger woman looked up as the 
giant shuriken descended at her from a diagonal angle. She 
actually had underestimated this man. But even so... she was 
more than a match for Zanmaru. While Gyakusatsu plummeted at 
her; Shiki stood upright but focused her attentions on Zanmaru; 
not the shuriken. She remained still and silent. Just until she 
brought up her hands. 

Zanmaru scowled. &quot;Fledgling kunoichi! If you had sense you&#39;d try 
to dodge the attack!&quot;

Shiki pressed all of her attention into her hands; ignoring 
Zanmaru&#39;s comments. Not that he wasn&#39;t an important component in 
what she was intending. Shiki flashed her hands around in a 
series of actions that emulated the katas that Zanmaru had 
performed. But her work was much faster and much more exotic. 
Her hands moved in a blur; pressing from one hand pose to the 
other; until both hands were clasped together in the 
double-handed sign of the shinobi; her thin fingers interlocked. 
The Gyakusatsu came zooming down in about a metre&#39;s distance; 
ready to kill the girl. 

Of course, Shiki had other plans... &quot;Shunhenkou!&quot;

A puff of spiritual smoke enveloped both Shiki and Zanmaru. But 
the results were something else altogether. Zanmaru blinked as 
he waved away the smoke. He looked across from him and saw 
Shiki; standing in the exact same position he had been in. He 
was confused; very much so, until it lost its meaning. The vivid 
chime of spinning metal rang in his ears. Before he could even 
realize it, the Gyakusatsu same straight down at him. The older 
man coughed up a geyser of blood into his mouthpiece. The giant 
shuriken impaled him with one of its four points; straight 
through the stomach. And so the Lightning Shinobi felt the taste 
of his own attack. The electric charge from the weapon shocked 
his body senseless. His head jerked wildly from both the pain of 
the blood-oozing wound and the pain of the vivid electrocution. 
Once it had taken its toll; Zanmaru fell backwards; with his own 
shuriken lodged in his abdomen. He collapsed to the ground in a 
heap. Alive; but stunned and mortally wounded. 

Shiki lowered her hands and walked up to the downed ninja. He 
had over estimated himself after all. And Shiki didn&#39;t even have 
to use any of her own weapons to kill him. The girl went over to 
Zanmaru and crouched downwards, looking him in the eye.

&quot;...Looks like you fell prey to your own powers.&quot; She spoke. 

Zanmaru coughed again, spurting blood through the dark purple 
wrappings around his mouthpiece. &quot;...How... did you...?&quot;

&quot;Switch our positions?&quot; Shiki replied, &quot;It&#39;s called Shunhenkou 
(Instant Alteration). It&#39;s a  Contemporary Art invented by your 
master, the Honshu Koga. It allows the user to switch places 
with the target. If used fast enough.&quot;

Though it was a struggle, Zanmaru managed to laugh groggily. 
&quot;...Heh, heh, heh... I see. You clever bitch... you&#39;ve been 
trained in... Mizuryu style.... Ninjutsu... no wonder... 
Hirotsugu-sama wants you... eliminated...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no chance of that,&quot; Shiki answered, looking down at the 
dying man, &quot;Because your Lord is going to fall to me. This is 
why I came to Tokyo. To kill the Honshu Koga.&quot;

Zanmaru was just about to make another comment in reply to that. 
But he didn&#39;t get the chance to do so. The second his lips 
parted from behind his mouthpiece, a streak of power came down 
across his neck in a flash. A gush of blood spurted across the 
stone ground of the roof as the attack hacked off the shinobi&#39;s 
head in one clean stroke. The decapitated head of Zanmaru rolled 
away with open, bloodshot eyes, while Shiki looked up urgently. 
There was another shinobi standing across from her. Atop the 
metal railing of the roof. A young man, dressed in a white and 
blue hakama, with an unsheathed katana at his hand. He possessed 
somewhat feminine looks, with long jet black hair tied back into 
a low-hanging ponytail. His large and healthy black eyes looked 
down upon Shiki from the metal railing. He had been the one to 
finish off Zanmaru. 

Shiki eyed him cautiously. &quot;...Who the hell are you?&quot;

&quot;Kugure Setsuki,&quot; The youthful man took a bow, &quot;At your 
service.&quot;

That wasn&#39;t enough for Shiki, though. &quot;You must be one of the 
&#39;Six Orochi&#39; I keep hearing about. Nobody else could kill 
someone else that easily.&quot;

To that, Setsuki nodded; sheathing his katana in the sheath at 
the side of his waist. &quot;You are correct. I am the Third Orochi. 
But that man you just defeated was a failure. We had a feeling 
that things would not go well for him. So to spare him prolonged 
agony by bleeding to death; I put him out of his misery. It is 
best that way.&quot;

Shiki stood upright. &quot;I see. So that&#39;s all you&#39;ve come for?&quot;

&quot;Quite the little fireball, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Setsuki replied, 
chuckling, &quot;Fresh from your battle with Zanmaru-san and yet you 
are willing to challenge me. But the spilling of blood is not my 
true intention today. All that I wanted was to see the power of 
the girl that Hirotsugu-sama wishes to see dead so badly. And I 
am pleased with what I&#39;ve seen so far. Zanmaru-san was clearly 
no match for you. You are as deadly as you are beautiful.&quot;

Great, now one of the Six Orochi was hitting on her. &quot;...I&#39;m 
going to kill that Lord of yours.&quot;

&quot;We shall see, my dear,&quot; A circular wind began to surrounded the 
charismatic Setsuki, enfolding him with storm and leaves. Soon
