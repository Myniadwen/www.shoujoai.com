<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Cherilyn awoke from yet another nightmare; she had several throughout 
the night. Each increasingly more intense then the other and all having 
to do with the Western Wood in one form or another and she was glad to 
see that the sun had finally rose. She got out of bed and pulled open 
the curtains to let the warm sun&#39;s warm light in and stood still with 
her eyes closed, bathing in the calming light.  However, today even the 
morning&#39;s shining sun didn&#39;t seem to wash away her worries, nothing felt 
right since escaping that forest. 

She felt something was not right with her surroundings. Anxiously she 
inspected the area for anything that was out of place and noticed 
something lying upon her desk. As she approached the desk she felt 
uneasiness fill her heart. Atop the desk was a large yellow manila 
envelope with her name neatly scrawled across the front in a tight 
calligraphy script. She was certain that the envelope had not been there 
when she had last awoken from her nightmares and there was only one 
person who used such a fancy handwriting in the school, Headmistress 
Sophia, and this fact did not set easily upon Cherilyn&#39;s mind. She 
glanced around to see her small roommate was still soundly sleeping in 
her nightshirt with her blankets partly kicked off the bed. Cherilyn 
warily reached out to touch the envelope; the butterflies in her stomach 
escaping from their cage and were wreaking havoc on her nerves. She 
apprehensively licked her lips as she picked up the envelope by the 
corner when there was a light knocking at the door that caused her to 
jump and recoil from the paper. 

&quot;Wh... who is it?&quot; Cherilyn asked trying hard to hide her tension, her 
eyes unable to leave the letter.

The bedroom door opened and Tanya quickly entered, &quot;Cherilyn!!!&quot; She 
exclaimed with such excitement that it forced Cherilyn to turn around 
and face her friend, &quot;You will not believe what just happened.&quot; She was 
waving a large yellow envelope exactly like the one Cherilyn had just 
found, &quot;I&#39;m being transferred!&quot; She rejoiced. 

Panic filled Cherilyn&#39;s eyes, she spun around, snatched up her envelope 
and tore it open in one swift movement. Inside she found a single piece 
of pink paper with her photo on the right hand corner and along the top 
of the page were the words &#39;Notice of Transfer to Western Wing&#39;.

&quot;NOOOO!!!&quot; Cherilyn screamed out and collapsed to the ground trembling. 
Cherilyn&#39;s roommate sat bolt up right at the sound and searched for what 
had awoken her.

Tanya rushed to Cherilyn and dropped to the girl&#39;s side, &quot;Cherilyn, are 
you alright?&quot; She inquired anxiously, &quot;What happened?&quot; Shakily Cherilyn 
handed Tanya the notice with her face buried in her hand. Tanya only 
smiled at the page, &quot;This is great. Maybe we can room together.&quot; She 
said unhesitatingly.

&quot;I... I don&#39;t belong... there...&quot; Cherilyn quivered as her worst fears 
were coming true. She feared this day from the moment she realized she 
had feelings for Tanya. She knew that entering those woods marked her 
for sure, she could feel it on her skin and it made her feel filthy. Now 
she was being signalled out and set to the one place she didn&#39;t belong, 
the Western Wings. 

&quot;There is nothing wrong with the West Wing.&quot; Tanya assured her friend, 
&quot;Jenn and Kris are already there. It will be gre-&quot; 

&quot;No it won&#39;t!&quot; Cherilyn snapped, cutting the girl off, &quot;This is all your 
fault.&quot; Her voice rose to a point of hysteria as she clenched her arms 
around herself tightly. That was right, it was Tanya who wanted to be 
transferred and not her. She turned her angry eyes on Tanya, &quot;If you had 
not gone running off into that damned forest then none of this would 
have happened. I don&#39;t want to leave here. I don&#39;t want to go to that 
place. The girls there are creepy and I don&#39;t belong there.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Tanya stared at Cherilyn, bewildered by her friend&#39;s outburst.

Cherilyn sharply stood to her feet, &quot;Why can&#39;t you understand this?&quot; She 
screamed hysterically, &quot;Why do you always have to think about yourself? 
Why can&#39;t you think of me for once? What I want?&quot;

&quot;I... I thought...&quot; Tanya stammered, &quot;I thought you... you wanted to be 
with everyone? Don&#39;t you want to be with me?&quot; She inquired, crawling 
backwards on the ground to get out of range of her friend&#39;s fury.

&quot;Yes, but not there!&quot; Cherilyn gestured violently out the window at the 
Western Dorms off in the distance, &quot;And not with those girls!&quot; She cried 
out, waving her hands madly about frantically, &quot;They are sick and 
perverted crazy people that don&#39;t belong in the world.&quot;

Tanya&#39;s brow knitted in disapproval of her friend&#39;s outburst, &quot;Those 
girls are my friends.&quot; She declared softly, a fury burning lightly in 
the back of Tanya&#39;s mind. Tanya was one of the few from the Eastern 
dorms that treated the Western Dorm girls with any level of respect. She 
knew Cherilyn disliked the Western Dorm but this was the first she had 
heard her friend refer to those girls in such a hateful manner. Tanya 
abruptly sprung to her feet and glared at Cherilyn with anger filled 
eyes, &quot;And I am one of them.&quot; She declared proudly, &quot;If you think that 
my friends and I are sick and demented then I don&#39;t want to be around 
you anymore.&quot; She shouted then stormed out of the room.

Cherilyn was taken back by Tanya&#39;s rage. Tanya had never shown any sign 
of anger before and now Cherilyn was watching as her friend was running 
away from her. &quot;Tanya!?!&quot; Cherilyn called out finally finding her legs 
and tried to chase after her friend to have the door slammed in her 
face. She punched at the door in frustration. Why did she always find 
herself having doors slammed in her face?

Her roommate perched upon the edge of her bed, watching Cherilyn slid 
down the door in defeat, &quot;You just can&#39;t win now can you?&quot; The roommate 
said nonchalantly. 

&quot;Shut up!!!&quot; Cherilyn yelled and tossed a housecoat at the girl who 
dodged it gracefully by somersaulting backwards across her bed. 

&quot;Don&#39;t go yelling at me.&quot; The girl said irately as she stood to her feet 
and walking over to pick up the notice off the ground, &quot;You decided to 
go into those woods after her. You knew what you were getting into.&quot; She 
handed the paper over to Cherilyn, &quot;Now you have to deal with the 
outcome.&quot;

Cherilyn took the paper and let out a deep, disappointed sigh.
