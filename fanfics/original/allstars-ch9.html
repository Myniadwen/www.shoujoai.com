11:07 am

            One of Leena&#39;s biggest concerns was that nobody would show 
up for try-outs over the weekend, and that interest would die down in 
the last two days before school started.  She may have been overly 
worried--after all, there were sufficient players in the team--but it 
was her job to look out for these girls and guide them; she wasn&#39;t sure 
how far the current lineup would progress.  She decided that since it 
didn&#39;t seem likely anybody else would volunteer, she would organize the 
team into positions and begin training.  Of course, she would keep an 
eye out for newcomers, but her faith only went so far, and she was 
prepared to go ahead with the women she had right now.  Still, should 
anything happen to them...

            &quot;Honey?  You don&#39;t look so well.&quot;  All of Leena&#39;s troubles 
seemed to unwind as she gazed into her wife&#39;s angelic face.  Kathlyn was 
a blessing from heaven, and there was no way Leena could&#39;ve made it this 
far without her.  She tried to smile for her sake.

            &quot;I know, I&#39;ve been spacing out.  I&#39;m just worried.&quot;

            &quot;We have four days left, silly,&quot; Kathlyn giggled.  &quot;That&#39;s 
plenty of time to find some reserves.  Some of the girls have even taken 
a proactive step and gone out looking for volunteers.  Lauren, Freya, 
and Terra have been a big help.  Now stop frowning; you&#39;re too pretty 
for that.  We don&#39;t have to bite our nails until Tuesday, remember?  
TUESDAY.&quot;  Leena&#39;s grin broadened, and she snuggled into Kathlyn&#39;s arms, 
feeling blessed to be married to such a wonderful woman.

            &quot;You&#39;re right, I&#39;m sorry.  Let&#39;s try to enjoy ourselves 
until then.  The team won&#39;t function if their Coach&#39;s morale is low.&quot;  
Kathlyn smiled and stroked her lover&#39;s cheek, trailing her hand down 
until it rested atop her chest.

            &quot;Maybe we should give it a boost, then.&quot;

            &quot;But the try-outs are three hours away!&quot; she giggled.  &quot;What 
do you have in mind, little kitten?&quot;  Kathlyn leaned in until her lips 
were almost touching Leena&#39;s ear.  Her voice sunk seductive and low.

            &quot;Just close your eyes and let it happen.&quot;

You complete my fate

The world unwinds inside of me

You complete my fate

The halo crawls away

You repeat my fate

Rewinding all we can

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Come and save me

You complete my fate

The heavens stroll inside of me

You repeat my fate

Revealing who we are

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Fill me up

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Let me follow

&quot;Positions&quot;

            &quot;Darn it, I&#39;m going to be late!&quot;

            Maria Maethers checked her watch again, cringed, and shifted 
her papers from one hand to the other, basically fidgeting in a vain 
attempt to kill time.  Helping Freya organize the team and gather 
players had been tougher than she had anticipated, and designing all 
their uniforms (And I still don&#39;t even have their measurements, she 
grumbled) had kept her up almost all night.  Now she was paying for her 
delinquency by being at the tail end of a long line of procrastinators 
waiting to buy their books.  It felt like somebody had tripped her on 
purpose, making her spill an armful of university merchandise, and 
kicked her when she was down.

            &quot;Hindsight is always 20/20,&quot; she muttered as she pulled out 
her design sketches.  Too bad she had spent all night completing them; 
she could use something like this to distract her.  The line moved a few 
steps and she shuffled along, studying and scribbling in some additional 
thoughts.  A handful of people shared her impatience, including the 
person standing behind her.

            &quot;Mi Dios, there&#39;s always a line.  At this rate, if the 
bookstore doesn&#39;t close before I get there, they might run out!&quot;

            &quot;I hear ya, sister!&quot;  Maria answered.  She cheered up as she 
saw what her neighbor was wearing:  she had on baggy red pants that hung 
just low enough to reveal a blue thong, and two shirts, a light 
long-sleeved black shirt underneath a white tank top with some rather 
exquisite lozenge patterns.  Her hair was quite long, and had an 
arresting red hue that seemed almost black in the stale halogen 
lighting.  Her eyes shimmered amber, sometimes flickering to match her 
hair, and she had the body of a model:  athletic, thin, and feminine, 
with great expressive eyes and a pouty mouth, all radiating off a 
creamy-bronze skin as soft and silky as butter.  But words are slow:  
all of this was absorbed instantly by an experienced fashion designer.

            &quot;Ohmygod, I love your outfit!&quot; both women exclaimed at the 
same time.  They laughed at themselves and began to chatter about their 
hobby.

            &quot;I make almost all of my own clothes, and right now I&#39;m 
contracted by an influential European family.&quot;

            &quot;Wow, really?  I&#39;ve actually been working very close for a 
major designer in Bilbao for seven years.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, cool!  I&#39;ve been to Spain several times:  wonderful 
country.  Have you ever been to Germany?&quot;

            &quot;Once or twice, but I never stayed long.  So what do you 
like to do?

            &quot;Well, mostly design...but I also like to use my friends as 
dress-up dolls!  I&#39;ve really been getting into some medical texts, 
though:  my best friend has a very serious internal condition, and I 
want to see if I can help her in any way.  What about you?&quot;

            &quot;Hmm, me?  I&#39;m into drawing, reading, shopping, music, 
movies, physics, exploring...&quot;

            &quot;Wow, you&#39;re a real Renaissance woman!  What kind of music 
do you like?&quot;

            &quot;Pretty much all kinds.  I actually compose a little, too, 
and I even play the violin.&quot;

            &quot;Awesome!  I&#39;ve dabbled in this graphic arts program, too, 
but mostly I just focus on my clothes.  I&#39;m Maria Maethers, by the way,&quot; 
she announced.  The kindred spirits shook hands.

Behind the beautiful face lies a beautiful mind

Awakening two worlds through perception and experience

The sun shines brighter because of her smile

Valencia Durante

            &quot;Is that your portfolio?&quot; Valencia said, indicating the 
sketchbook Maria had been studying.  She grinned and showed it to her.

            &quot;It&#39;s one of them.  Take a look and tell me what you think.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, thanks!  Here,&quot; she said, digging through her 
belongings, &quot;you can have mine.&quot;  The two designers continued to move up 
the line, but they were mostly absorbed by the works of the other.  
Maria was impressed:  Valencia loved throwing around white, blue, green, 
black, and red, in no particular order, and turning them into something 
attractive, functional, and comfortable, utilizing layers, color 
schemes, and patterns to work her magic.  Valencia, on the other hand, 
was amazed at Maria&#39;s very unusual but very cute choices.  She obviously 
leaned towards cosplay, sexy lingerie, gothic/Lolita, and kimonos.  
Something else within the portfolio caught Maria&#39;s attention, and she 
stared at it intently, long enough for the line to move again.

            &quot;Is this...an Adrien F&eacute;lix?&quot;

            &quot;Yup.&quot;  Her mouth nearly came unhinged.

            &quot;Are you telling me you know Adrien F&eacute;lix?!&quot;

            &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said casually.  Maria squealed and grabbed 
Valencia&#39;s shoulders.

            &quot;Ohmygod, Val, you HAVE to introduce me to him!  I&#39;ve been 
wanting to meet F&eacute;lix for years!!  The guy&#39;s a genius--please, I have to 
meet him!&quot;

            &quot;Settle down, beautiful,&quot; Valencia chuckled.  &quot;There&#39;s no 
way a woman like me could refuse you.  Jefe would love you.  Oh, say, 
who&#39;s this in the picture?  She&#39;s gorgeous!&quot;  Valencia was pointing to a 
photograph that had been taken for Freya&#39;s prom.

            &quot;Yeah, isn&#39;t she sexy?  That&#39;s Freya, my best friend.&quot;

            &quot;Freya?!&quot; Valencia shrieked.  &quot;Do you mean Freya von 
Hohenheim?!  Mi Dios, now you have to introduce me to somebody!  I can&#39;t 
believe you know her!&quot;

            &quot;Well, yeah,&quot; she chuckled humbly, &quot;we&#39;ve been friends since 
kindergarten.  &quot;Say, let&#39;s make a double-date!  You bring F&eacute;lix and I&#39;ll 
bring Freya!  How&#39;s that sound?&quot;

            &quot;Great!!  That would be excellent--and I&#39;m sure Jefe would 
like to see your friend as well.  Ach, would you look at that, the 
line&#39;s moved so far while we were talking.&quot;  Maria turned around, and 
sure enough, she had been so absorbed with her new friend that she had 
forgotten where she was and what she was doing.

            &quot;Yeah.  Good thing we&#39;re the last two.  I just wish somebody 
had told us.&quot;

            &quot;I know, people are much more self-absorbed in America.&quot;

            &quot;You said it,&quot; Maria sighed.  When they caught up to the end 
of the line, they were relieved to see it was so short, and the store 
still open from the looks of it.  The two women exchanged light 
pleasantries while they waited for their turn.  Valencia was surprised 
to hear about Maria&#39;s homosexuality, but it was a pleasant surprise:  
she had hoped her new friend swung that way.  Vaguely she wondered if 
Maria had ever tried to seduce Lady von Hohenheim herself, or if she 
would be interested in directing those charms...elsewhere.  She went 
into the store weighing these ideas in her mind, and showed her list of 
required texts to the clerk.  Along with fashion design, Valencia also 
chose Science, English, Sociology, and something that fascinated Maria:

            &quot;Advanced geometry?&quot;  She shrugged nonchalantly.

            &quot;I&#39;ve always had a knack for it.  Besides, I&#39;ve based a lot 
of my designs on geometric patterns.&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, I could tell!  Hmm, I never thought of it that way.  
Maybe you can give me a few pointers later.&quot;

            &quot;Before or after the double-date?&quot; she grinned slyly.  Maria 
could tell just by looking into Valencia&#39;s amber eyes that she was 
interested in her, and not just as a friend or design consultant:  there 
was a flicker of sexuality brimming in those tawny orbs; Maria was 
excited just by imagining it.  Once they were finished gathering their 
books, they programmed each other&#39;s numbers into their phones, and waved 
goodbye until next time.

--Terra Tu, 19, 5&#39;4&quot; (5&#39;4&quot; (1.62 m), no position--

            Leena, Kathlyn, and Freya all came to the try-outs that 
afternoon with four things in mind:  one, the disorganized team would be 
arranged into set positions that were pliable at need; two, today would 
mark the unofficial beginning of training; three, while additions would 
certainly be welcome, the established team would receive more focus; and 
finally, it would rain over the weekend, lowering the chances of any 
newcomers arriving.  They would have to seize this opportunity while it 
was still available.

            &quot;Has everyone met everybody else?&quot; Leena said as the 
thirteen girls trudged onto the field, a variety of emotions cascading 
together.  Since Arina, Alice, and Jennifer had just been added, the 
consensus was No.  &quot;Take some time out to greet each other while you&#39;re 
warming up.  I realize this might be a little early, but I want to get 
as much practice in as I can.  The purpose of today&#39;s session will be to 
explain the basic mechanics of soccer for those of you who don&#39;t know, 
and to put you into your positions.  First of all, let&#39;s go over a brief 
history and explanation of the game.  This may seem pointless for you 
veterans, but remember that everyone was a beginner at one point, and 
every bit of information counts.

            &quot;Soccer, also known as football, began as a modern 
professional sport in the United Kingdom in 1885, and rose in America in 
1967, although historians believe it might have been played in ancient 
times.  It&#39;s the most popular sport in the world, which is probably why 
Ms. Rosewood proposed it for our university&#39;s first athletic team.  
There are two opposing teams of eleven players who attempt to score in 
the opponent&#39;s goal by kicking or knocking the ball with any part of the 
body, except the hands and arms.  A standard soccer field measures 115 
by 75 yards, the goal is eight yards wide and eight feet tall, and there 
are two forty-five minute halves.  Right now, we have eleven players, 
but I&#39;m hoping to acquire more in case we need to make a substitute:  
there cannot be more than three switches per game, so I&#39;m hoping we can 
find at least three more players.

            &quot;Now that we have the boring part over with,&quot; she grinned, 
&quot;it&#39;s time for me to assign your positions.  I&#39;m going to start with the 
experienced players first, based on my observations, then I&#39;ll go around 
and squeeze in the beginners.  I&#39;m going to rely on you vets to get the 
others up to speed, now.  Lauren, I&#39;m going to put you as the goalkeeper 
for now, since it looks like you know how to catch well.  Fausta, I want 
you to be my sweeper.  I realize that you were also vying for that 
position, Miss Threal, but Fausta&#39;s got an edge when it comes to 
anticipating mistakes and filling in for the others.  You&#39;re going to be 
our stopper; it&#39;s a fairly similar job, anyway.  You, Lauren, and Fausta 
will be our last line of defense, so I&#39;m counting on you.

            &quot;For the defensive midfielders, I&#39;ve selected Nadia and 
Jennifer.  You both have excellent control and stamina, and you&#39;re able 
to manage quick counterattacks.  Felicity, I&#39;ve assigned you the role of 
the forward, and Kasumi, you&#39;re the striker.  These two are offensive 
positions, and you&#39;re tailor-made for them.  Amy, Terra, based on your 
performances, I&#39;ve decided to assign you as left and right back, 
respectively.  Your task will be to cover your side of the field and 
either slow down or stop the opponent&#39;s progress.  That means you&#39;re 
going to have to sync up with Fausta and Shannon; I hope you&#39;re up to 
the task.  Elisa, Alice, I&#39;m still not comfortable giving you two an 
assigned position, but unless we find more players, you&#39;re going to be 
my left and right midfielders.  The only thing you need to concentrate 
on is passing to Felicity and Kasumi.  You&#39;ll be right in the middle of 
the action, though, so you&#39;d better stay sharp.  Arina will work 
alongside Freya, Kathlyn, Shiki, and Maria as a member of the staff.  
Their job will be to work on strategy, assist me, handle medical issues, 
and do other miscellaneous tasks.

            &quot;Now none of these assignments are absolute, mind you; it&#39;s 
just my way of keeping things organized, so if you&#39;re put somewhere you 
feel uncomfortable, don&#39;t be afraid to speak up.  With that said, I hope 
you&#39;ve all brought something you can practice in, because we&#39;re going to 
be starting our drills.  Lauren, Kathlyn has your gloves, so make sure 
you put them on.  The rest of you, get to your assigned positions.  
Arina, Shiki, would you be kind enough to help me out here on the 
field?&quot;

            &quot;Certainly,&quot; they replied.  &quot;It would be our pleasure.&quot;

            &quot;Great.  Maria, when do you think you&#39;ll have their uniforms 
ready?&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;ve got several designs you can go over, but I&#39;ll need 
their measurements soon.  Here.&quot;  She gave Leena several sketches she 
had colored in, and waited for a response.  Freya leaned over to see 
what insidious creations her best friend had made this time, and was 
stunned to find out they were all quite decent-looking.

            &quot;Wha?!  No yukatas or frilly dresses, Maria?  Not even a 
three-piece gothic-Lolita?&quot;

            &quot;Don&#39;t be absurd!&quot; she exclaimed, sounding offended.  &quot;Fun 
is fun and work is work, Frey-Frey.  These warriors have to be stylish, 
magnificent, and comfortable with what they&#39;re wearing.  If they don&#39;t 
take pride in their uniforms, they won&#39;t win any games!&quot;  Shiki looked 
over Leena&#39;s shoulder as well, morbidly curious about what the surprise 
was.  She didn&#39;t expect her longtime rival to take this project so 
seriously--that was Freya&#39;s job.  She was floored by the results.

            &quot;Maria, I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this in a positive way, 
but you&#39;ve really outdone yourself!  They&#39;re all amazing!  You must have 
been sober to make these!&quot;

            &quot;Hardy-har, it&#39;s nothing but sweat, tears, and toil.  You 
might want to try it sometime!&quot;

            &quot;Shiki does sweat, a lot,&quot; Freya squeaked, glowing sweetly.  
Shiki&#39;s entire face turned purple and she thrust the portfolio back into 
Leena&#39;s arms.

            &quot;I approve them all,&quot; she said sharply.  &quot;Good work, Maria.  
Perhaps if you can take their measurements without turning it into an 
orgy, I just might apologize for making fun of you.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, wow, what an incentive!  You&#39;d better be prepared to 
eat those words, Araya-chan!  I don&#39;t mix business with pleasure unless 
it&#39;s with my Frey-Frey!&quot;  She piled onto the fragile blonde like a heavy 
blanket, making her stumble and giggle.  Not everyone was taking this 
day so lightly:  Fausta and Shannon were scoffing and rolling their 
eyes, impatient for the practice to start.

            &quot;We came to play, not have fun!&quot; Jen shouted ironically.  
She grinned at Nadia, flashing a thumbs-up.  The Russian didn&#39;t get the 
joke and asked Felicity to explain it.

            &quot;Never mind, just focus.  They&#39;re all being silly.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, silly is fun, but even with playing, we need focus.  Iz 
that what Jenny meant?&quot;

            &quot;Sort of,&quot; she answered.  Leena decided that it would be 
best if the players voted for their own uniforms, and gave the portfolio 
back before jogging out onto the field.  Amy, Terra, Elisa, and Alice 
were unfamiliar with their positions, so they needed to be shown where 
to stand on the field.  Once everyone was in position, Leena, Arina, and 
Shiki started the very first drills.

--Kasumi Beckett, 20, 5&#39;8&quot; (1.72 m), striker--

            It didn&#39;t take Freya long to realize she didn&#39;t need to 
pretend to be cheerful around Arina.  Both narcissistic and 
self-loathing, Arina came off as rather twisted at first, and her 
demure, thoughtful way of observing the world and speaking her thoughts 
made her seem detached from human interests.  But regardless of her 
demeanor, she was very astute and saw straight through Freya&#39;s guise, 
even though she mainly focused on the game.  When she came back to 
gather some water bottles, Freya tried waving and smiling at her, and 
while Arina returned the gestures, her eyes had the look of one who 
could see through the ruse we all put up when we&#39;re with other people, 
and Freya was smart enough to realize this.  She fluffed her golden hair 
to make herself look busy, and tried starting a conversation.

            &quot;So what do you think of the team so far?  We have quite a 
number of talented people with us, and they&#39;re all very beautiful, too.&quot;

            &quot;Really?  I hadn&#39;t noticed that yet.  It takes me longer to 
realize that sort of thing.&quot;

            &quot;I didn&#39;t just mean on the outside,&quot; she smiled.  Arina 
nodded dimly.

            &quot;Neither did I.  If you want me to answer your first 
question, I&#39;ll need more time to study.  It&#39;s more difficult to measure 
a group.&quot;  She ended her thoughts and put her focus back on the game.  
Freya sighed and scooted closer to Maria, and touched her hand.

            &quot;It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve seen Shiki enjoying 
herself this much,&quot; she commented.  Araya certainly looked like she was 
having fun:  her face was lit up with pure joy as she helped pass, kick, 
and dribble the ball to the players.  She stepped in whenever one of the 
novices fell short, offering a helping hand or an encouraging word.  Out 
of all four of the amateurs, Elisa was, amazingly, able to bounce back 
the fastest, even though she was just as quick to note how sloppy her 
playing was.

            &quot;I really should have been able to get that pass,&quot; she said 
bashfully.  She slapped her cheeks and took a deep breath.  &quot;All right, 
it&#39;s time for me to wake up.  I can do better, Araya-san.&quot;

            &quot;I know you can.  Ah, please excuse me, it seems I&#39;m needed 
again.&quot;  Elisa smiled sweetly as Shiki ran over to tend to Alice; she 
had slipped on the grass and was now sprawled out in all her gangly 
glory.  Leena sighed and decided to move on to offensive practice.

            &quot;Beckett, Velur, heads up!  I want you both to try and 
score.  Defense, hang back and give them a few free kicks.  Lauren, you 
work your magic.&quot;

            &quot;I am all over it,&quot; she grinned, squatting down like a 
shortstop anticipating a line drive.  Kasumi came in first, charging 
like a bull and firing a net-shattering blast right past Lauren, who 
just stared in awe.  Beckett smirked arrogantly and gestured for the 
ball.

            &quot;Spacing out there, baseball girl?&quot;

            &quot;Hell no!  You just sent a freakin&#39; missile my way, that&#39;s 
all!  Felicity, why don&#39;t you try it?  You look pretty ladylike to me!&quot;

            &quot;Was that supposed to be a compliment?&quot; she grumbled as 
Lauren tossed her the ball.  But Velur didn&#39;t let up:  she sent the ball 
blurring past Lauren with as much strength and precision as Kasumi.  The 
two offensive players silently exchanged a high-five, while Lauren was 
left to grumble.  She tossed the ball to Leena and pouted.

            &quot;Show a little more restraint, you two,&quot; she warned them.  
&quot;Lauren&#39;s not nearly as experienced as you are.  She needs to learn how 
to catch, and showing off won&#39;t help.  From now on, go easy on her until 
she&#39;s found her groove.&quot;

            &quot;I don&#39;t need nobody pampering me,&quot; Lauren grumbled, wiping 
her nose.  Leena tossed Amy the ball and gave the hotheaded goalie a 
sagacious stare.

            &quot;Eventually, Lauren, you will need to learn how to catch 
those hardballs.  The other strikers and forwards will employ those 
exact same techniques to score, and if you can&#39;t keep up, you won&#39;t be 
any good to the team.&quot;  Lauren frowned but gave Leena a &quot;yes ma&#39;am&quot;, 
then clapped her hands and asked for another barrage.  Amy and Terra had 
much fiercer kicks, but there was less control behind them, and Lauren 
caught them with less difficulty.  Nadia and Jen were in line next, and 
Lauren proved herself once more SYMBOL 8212 \f &quot;Times New Roman&quot; \s 
12but only because Nadia held back too much.

            &quot;So what was that?&quot; Leena questioned firmly.  Nadia was 
clearly confused.

            &quot;You say be gentle, make sure Laurie catchez shots, da?&quot;

            &quot;I didn&#39;t say let her catch them, I just said to go easy.  
Try again.&quot;  Nadia sighed and made another attempt, and while Lauren did 
catch it, she had to put up a lot more effort.

            &quot;Khovansky&#39;s not too shabby aftah all,&quot; Shannon noticed.  
&quot;She may be a goof and a ditz, but she&#39;s got talent, I&#39;ll give hah that.  
Are we next, Coach?&quot;

            &quot;No, gimme a minute,&quot; Lauren gasped.  &quot;That last one really 
wiped me out.&quot;

            &quot;It&#39;s because you have a flair for the dramatic,&quot; Fausta 
said airily.  Lauren glared at her, and Fausta glared right back.  &quot;This 
isn&#39;t Hollywood, Ofdensen.  You don&#39;t need to give a performance every 
time you catch the ball.&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;m not giving a fucking performance, ghibli,&quot; she growled, 
throwing in the new nickname Felicity had coined.  The name had spread 
and almost everybody used it (everybody that rubbed Fausta the wrong 
way, anyway), which only helped increase the tension and anger.

            &quot;Really?&quot; she sang venomously.  &quot;Khovansky&#39;s not a bad 
offensive player, but it wasn&#39;t as if she put everything she had into 
that attack, either--unlike you.&quot;

            &quot;All right, that&#39;s enough.  Don&#39;t make me dump this water on 
you.&quot;  Leena tapped the bottle on Fausta&#39;s head and threw another one to 
Lauren.  &quot;Remember, ladies, this is only a warm-up exercise, not a game, 
so let&#39;s not take things so seriously.&quot;

            &quot;If we do that, we may as well not take anything seriously,&quot; 
Fausta countered.  Lauren growled to herself as she slurped her water 
down.  She had hoped that everyone on the team could at least fake being 
civil and concentrate on their goal, but...urgh, why did Fausta have to 
be so fanatical?  She continued blowing out hot air, slowly scalding 
Leena&#39;s saintly patience:  &quot;Football might be a game, Coach, but if we 
don&#39;t play this game seriously, we&#39;ll lose every time.&quot;

            &quot;I understand what you&#39;re saying,&quot; Leena said gently, 
looking into Fausta&#39;s piercing blue eyes, &quot;but you also have to keep in 
mind that about half the team is made up of people who&#39;ve never even 
played.  I saw something special in them, so I want to give them a 
chance.  Fausta, I want you on this team--we need that aggressive, 
indomitable spirit of yours--but if you can&#39;t give them some mercy, I 
will remove you.  Now I don&#39;t expect you two to shake hands, but don&#39;t 
start anymore meaningless arguments.  Take two laps around the field.&quot;

            &quot;Fine,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry for wasting everybody&#39;s 
time.  Ofdensen, if you can catch at least twenty more balls today, I&#39;ll 
apologize for my comment. Don&#39;t let me down.&quot;  She grinned  
sarcastically and jogged off, pacing herself like a natural.  Lauren 
rubbed her face until it was red.  What a character.

            &quot;Why are all the hot ones complete bitches?  Uh, present 
company excluded, you three!&quot;  Amy and Terra giggled shyly, while 
Shannon just rolled her eyes.  She didn&#39;t like it when other girls 
flirted with her.  It stirred negative sentiment.

            The drills continued without any serious interruption for 
about thirty more minutes before everyone was given a break.  The 
newcomers were huffing and puffing and smothering themselves with 
towels, while the vets were coming alive, ready and raring for some more 
action.  Leena plopped down on the coach&#39;s bench and gave her wife a 
weary smile; Kathlyn wordlessly walked behind her and massaged her 
shoulders.

            &quot;I&#39;m worried about Ofdensen,&quot; she confided.  &quot;She&#39;s a heck 
of a goalkeeper, don&#39;t get me wrong, but she only caught half the balls 
that came her way.  I&#39;m glad she and Fausta patched up--not that I&#39;m 
expecting anything to come from that--but what I&#39;m really concerned 
about is her dedication.  She still isn&#39;t putting her whole heart into 
it.&quot;

            &quot;I noticed that as well,&quot; Arina said as she mopped her face 
and neck.  She hadn&#39;t worked up this much of a sweat since she was in 
middle school.  &quot;Baseball was the only sport she took seriously.  To 
her, all this is just for fun.  She dove madly for that ball because she 
was showing off, and she&#39;s only making such a fuss because Miss Nazario 
was upset.  If you&#39;d like my opinion...&quot;  She waited for an answer, but 
Leena didn&#39;t look to her:  she looked at her wife.

            &quot;Well, you heard her, Katt.  What do you think?  Should we 
start looking for a replacement goalie?  We can&#39;t use anybody else on 
the team, that&#39;s for certain.&quot;

            &quot;I could fill in for her if you want,&quot; Kasumi offered.  
Leena kindly declined her offer.

            &quot;Thanks, but you&#39;re much better off where you are right now.  
I can&#39;t put the entire burden on Felicity&#39;s shoulders.  Besides, if 
Lauren takes your place, her attitude probably won&#39;t change.  I&#39;m afraid 
that currently, she&#39;s the best we have.&quot;


            &quot;Maybe not,&quot; Maria said suddenly, jumping out of her seat.  
&quot;I met someone earlier today who just might make the cut.  I could call 
her and have her come over here if you want.&quot;

            &quot;Who is it?&quot; Freya asked.  Maria smiled bashfully.

            &quot;Well...she&#39;s not a football player, or any other kind of 
player--but I think it could work out!  C&#39;mon, whaddya say, Coach?  
We&#39;ve got nothing to lose by asking her.&quot;

            &quot;Unless she declines,&quot; Leena shrugged, &quot;but give it a shot 
if you want.  It&#39;s all right by me.&quot;  Maria grinned and snapped out her 
phone; she had the woman&#39;s number up in no time.  It only took two rings 
for her to answer.

            &quot;Hey, Val, it&#39;s Maria!  How would you like to bump up that 
meeting with Freya by a few days?&quot;

--Amy Nguyen, 18, 5&#39;11&quot; (1.8 m), right back--

            Nobody knew what to expect when the grayish-black Ferrari 
F430 Spider rolled onto the parking lot and a stunning Spanish woman 
emerged, but needless to say, more than a few hearts were bewitched and 
several eyes began to linger.  Maria shot her arm up in the air and 
welcomed the woman onto the soccer field, introducing her as Valencia 
Durante, fellow fashion guru.

            &quot;Just &#39;Val&#39; is fine,&quot; she chirped.  &quot;So which one of you 
beautiful women is Freya von Hohenheim?  I thought I would be able to 
see her from afar, but it seems I was blinded by several other radiant 
faces.&quot;

            &quot;Sweet,&quot; Lauren laughed.  &quot;I love her already, Maria.  
Where&#39;d ya find her?&quot;

            &quot;We met in the bookstore line.  Freya&#39;s that uber-sexy 
blonde over there, talking to that snot-nosed Japanese laundry maid.  
I&#39;ll introduce you two later, but right now, could you do me a favor?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, sure, what?&quot;  Valencia&#39;s eyes kept staring as Maria led 
her onto the field and put her in the goalie&#39;s box.  She took all of her 
friend&#39;s paraphernalia and advised her to remove her purple high-heel 
shoes (gushing over how tragic it would be if they got a stain); 
Valencia did as instructed, but seemed puzzled.

            &quot;Interesting,&quot; Arina whispered as she gazed at them.  
&quot;Apparently, there&#39;s been a coup, and you&#39;re being routed.&quot;

            &quot;So?&quot; Lauren snorted.  &quot;Not as if I care.  I told everyone 
before that I&#39;m only here for fun.  She can be the god-damned goalie if 
she wants.  That&#39;ll get me away from the ghibli.&quot;  Arina sincerely 
smiled at her friend for a moment.

            &quot;I suppose even nonchalance can be a virtue.&quot;

            While Arina was trying to stir up some jealousy, Valencia&#39;s 
thoughts were racing as she tried wrapping her mind around what was 
happening.  Freya von Hohenheim was standing on the sidelines, waving 
and cheering as if she were an old friend, while the rest of the team 
looked on with varying degrees of interest.  Maria had explained to her 
new friend what she wanted, and at first, Valencia thought she was 
crazy.  She had absolutely no futebal experience whatsoever, and in 
spite of Jefe&#39;s assurances, she knew she wasn&#39;t up to the task.

            But oh, if I do join them, I&#39;ll be around all these 
beautiful women!  And if it&#39;s true that Freya von Hohenheim is the 
manager...

            &quot;Hey, uh, Miss Val, are you ready?&quot;  Valencia broke away 
from her thoughts and doubts, noticing a cute girl smiling back at her.  
She didn&#39;t know any names yet, so all she could do was nod.  Jennifer 
Andre, trying to dismiss her own reservations, launched a fairly good 
shot at the goal, yelling out &quot;here it comes!&quot;  Valencia shrieked and 
jerked out of the way--and Lauren laughed.

            &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she gasped, &quot;that was rude of me.  
She just has this really cute scream.&quot;  Arina sighed forlornly.

            &quot;How I envy you sometimes.&quot;  Jen gave Valencia a sweet smile 
and asked if she wanted to try again, perhaps without shutting her eyes 
or moving out of the way.

            &quot;Not so rough!&quot; Maria exclaimed.  &quot;That&#39;s an Adrien F&eacute;lix 
she&#39;s wearing!&quot;  Valencia waved at Jen and encouraged her to take 
another shot.

            &quot;Don&#39;t worry, this is an older shirt.  I mean, I wouldn&#39;t be 
so stupid as to wear one of my better outfits.  Let&#39;s try that again.&quot;

            &quot;Are you sure?&quot;  Val nodded and Jen delivered another kick.  
This time, she was ready for it, and jerked to the side like a graceful 
hawk, easily catching the checkered sphere.  Lauren clapped and even 
cheered.

            &quot;Bravo, bravo!  There&#39;s hope for her yet.&quot;

            &quot;Ignorance is such bliss,&quot; Arina sighed to herself.  Jen 
tried another shot--and another--and another--and they were all captured 
with pinpoint accuracy.  Some of the girls had to wash their faces or 
pinch themselves, just to make sure they weren&#39;t imagining things.  
Felicity took over for Jen, juggled the ball in the air, and stared at 
her target.  She, too, had noticed Valencia&#39;s sex appeal, but forced it 
back into her mind so she could concentrate on the game.  She putted two 
practice shots before bringing out the heavy artillery, and of the five 
fierce attacks she unleashed, Valencia caught an astounding three (but 
the other two were within a millimeter&#39;s breadth).

            &quot;Do you have anything to say now?&quot; Arina asked, a slight 
smirk of arrogance gracing her beauty.  Lauren laughed, reclined on the 
ground, and folded her hands, smiling peacefully.

            &quot;Um, does &#39;I think I&#39;m in love&#39; count?  Or were you 
expecting me to say something more like, &#39;Oh shit, she&#39;s better than me, 
I&#39;m mad now!&#39;&quot;

            &quot;Actually, I was hoping you would not say anything at all,&quot; 
she grinned.  Lauren snorted.

            &quot;You&#39;re such a pill.  Hell, if she gets to be on the team, 
I&#39;m asking that princess out on a date!  I mean, who the fuck cares if 
she gets to be the goalie?&quot;

            &quot;You&#39;re not even worried that you&#39;ll be cut?&quot;  Lauren 
cherished that sliver of concern on Essylt&#39;s impenetrable expression, 
almost as much as the caress of a lover.

            &quot;Now why would I feel that way?  Hey, Coach!  So what&#39;s the 
verdict?&quot;  Luckily, Leena hadn&#39;t heard their earlier exchange, because 
she might have added a few strict comments of her own.  She called 
Valencia to her side and had a few words with her, then gathered the 
whole team together and put her hand on the young woman&#39;s shoulder.

            &quot;Ladies, it is an honor and a privilege to welcome Valencia 
Durante to the team.  I guess our practice session today turned out 
better than I hoped.&quot;  The ladies were given leave to crowd around 
Valencia and welcome her (Ah, to be surrounded by beauties!  Paradise!), 
and though her thoughts were mainly focused on their attention, in the 
back of her mind, she was reeling.

            I hope that boss of mine isn&#39;t expecting me to owe him 
anything...although I probably should thank him.  I just hope none of 
these other women was the goalie.

           

Lauren finally approached Valencia when the crowds had gone, asking for 
a moment of her time.
