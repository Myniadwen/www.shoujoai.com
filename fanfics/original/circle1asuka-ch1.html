Author&#39;s Notes: This is the Circle of One. The second co-write between 
Kaiser Ryouga 2, Christine, and Shadow Bunny. But unlike the Last Saga 
4, we have fewer restraints here. But we decided from the beginning that 
this was not going to be a hardcore, over-the-top fiction about the fate 
of the world. But rather a story on a far smaller scale, determining the 
fates of the people involved rather than the land of the people 
involved. Thus it has a more &#39;personal&#39; feel to it, the thing we were 
aiming for most of all. A few things of notice, however. This story is 
based in 1800&#39;s Japan. Towards the declining era of the Tokugawa era. 
Thus it is a historical sword-and-samurai story. As with all historical 
stories, it is bound to have a few inaccuracies, something we don&#39;t mind 
admitting. All information used in the background of the story was taken 
from The Samurai Archives for posterity. There are some aspects of this 
story that are completely fictional, and others that aren&#39;t, issues that 
we will explain at the end of the story. And for good measure, let it be 
known that this fiction contains shoujo-ai (girl/girl lovin&#39;). If you 
can&#39;t hack that, then I suggest you look no further.

Alrighty then! The characters &#39;Hayate&#39; and &#39;Masahito&#39; are the creations 
and property of Shadow Bunny. The character &#39;Nanase&#39; is the creation and 
property of Christine. All other characters are the creations and 
property of Kaiser Ryouga 2. The three authors of this story reserve 
joint ownership of it. If you have any comments (good or constructive)

Slash One: The Silent Stranger of the South

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ 

Bunsei 1 (1819) 

It was the first year of Bunsei.

Or at least the first official year. Once again that which had been 
night fell to the presence of the sun. Dropping below sight and becoming 
a new day. To pave the way forward for a return to work and status. The 
grassland were soon enough awash with attendance of the male hyakushou, 
the farmers. Hacking with their makeshift scythes into the wheat, 
cultivating the land for the production of rice. One koku to each small 
pasture was more than enough for these men. Being that they had the 
consideration for their superiors in mind. The hot sun of the south 
beamed down of those scraggily-dressed workers, their faces creasing 
with the effort and matted with the sweat produced. These men would 
return to their wives and daughters as soon as the sun reached its peak, 
to rejuvenate themselves with small portions of food before they headed 
out for the afternoon labour. 

It was a tiring work, farming. 

One that had to be undertaken for the preservation of Nippon&#39;s future. 
Her life was precious to all. Perhaps that made it easier to understand 
how farmers held more prestige in the eyes of the public here than 
everywhere else. Being lower-borne was a consequence of fate. But the 
farming communities across the land were the backbone of its success. 
Such a thing at least allowed them small amounts of respect in a public 
majority. Not overtly so... but... enough to sustain a content existence 
on the fields for most common folk. 

But not everywhere.

And most certainly not in Hyuga.

Above the long stretch of farming lands and shacks was a large rise of 
stone. Like a hillock. One that had been forged into the highway by the 
breath and steel of the Gods. And in the face of that stone hillock was 
the path that entered the northern highway. From here on in the hill 
sloped downwards. And in the horizon, the small Joukamachi of Natsumura 
could be seen. A solitary figure strode softly down the tracks leading 
to Natsumura Village. That person&#39;s body was obscured in the length of a 
cloak, one that stretched from the shoulders down to the small feet that 
walked along the highway on a small pair of waraji. On this stranger&#39;s 
head was a straw-basin hat that obscured the traveller&#39;s face from 
sight. But not the long flow of hair that stretched down the back of 
that person cloak. Hair of a chestnut brown, tied into an elongated and 
loose ponytail 

The stranger looked to the left of their shoulder and saw farmers hard 
at work on the fields. Beyond them were the rather mountainous hills 
that overlooked the other han of the Hyuga domain. It was strange to 
think that over 200 years ago such a peaceful country as this was 
embroiled in the bloody fires of war. Tokugawa rule had done much to 
bring sanity and peace back to the countryside. But with all forms of 
peace came their price. An indifference to the suffering of others, 
those of the lower-borne, and a stringent system of control over the 
lives of the people, even the those of the many daimyo aligned with the 
shogunate. 

What was the cost of Nippon&#39;s peace? 

While the people here believed themselves to be building a future for 
their children and their grandchildren, they were stuck in status. 
Paralysed by the will of the Edo power-base. 

But then the traveller&#39;s head returned leisurely back to the pass. And 
they made their way down the dusty stone highway until, fifteen minutes 
later, that stranger was surrounded by the sights, sounds and smells of 
the small and quaint Natsumura Village. Women buzzed around the dirt 
tracks of the village, doing odd jobs. Be it fetching water from the 
nearby well or carrying bundles of washed clothing for their families. 
Some stood at the stalls of the markets, exchanging their rice, if not 
ryo, for goods. Natsumura Village, and all its wooden buildings, covered 
no more than half a mile of territory. But it was a domain with a high 
percentage of rice production, even if the lands owed to the han were 
small with comparison to others. Because of this, the small but lavish 
castle of this han&#39;s daimyo, Satou Genpachiro, left little to be 
desired. 

The samurai of the daimyo dotted the streets of the village. All of them 
possessed of the daisho and garbed in informal blue kimono. While the 
city of Edo had the doshin and the yoriki as their chief constabulary, 
the vast extent of many han of the land, from north to south, east to 
west, had the castle samurai for that job. It was a common and 
unshakable custom. But not a particularly welcomed one. 

A display of that situation was just now taking place.

&quot;Stupid commoner! How dare you not pay me the proper respect I&#39;m owed?&quot;

The stranger halted in their pass through the streets of Natsumura, and 
turned to see two of the castle samurai stationed in the village. They 
stood aggressively before two people. A young man, a farm hand, and an 
even younger woman beside him. The farmer boy was on the floor, his 
kimono covered in dirt. While one of the two castle samurai stood above 
him, leaning from the waist and arm pulled inward, as if to draw one of 
his blades. The young girl, who could have been no more than eighteen or 
nineteen years of age, kneeled down to the downed man&#39;s side and held 
him protectively.

&quot;Please, sir!&quot; She yelled desperately, &quot;forgive my brother! Farm work 
has been harder and harden in the han since last year! He is just tired 
and confused! Oh please won&#39;t you pardon him? Just this once?&quot;

The brother of the girl, Takahiro, frowned. &quot;Shut up, Nanase! I won&#39;t 
have you making any excuses for me! Are you really content to sit and 
bow at the feet of these Tokugawa-boot-licking pigs? I&#39;ll not have it!&quot;

The first of the castle samurai scowled and withdrew the second of his 
blades, the smaller and lighter wakizashi, causing a unified gasp from 
the commoners around who watched this all take place. &quot;You loud-mouthed 
peasant scum! Do you even know who I am? I am the chief warden of 
Katsubana-jo! I cater directly to Lord Satou himself! And you refuse to 
pay me the proper respect? Such arrogance is intolerable! Know your 
ignorance!&quot;

The one called Nanase shrieked in fear as the castle samurai brought up 
his blade to strike down her brother. The swift blade came downwards in 
that instant. But there was a severe flash of momentum in the 
split-second action. A blurred image of a warrior thrust itself in 
between the castle samurai and the brother and sister. The clash of 
steel meeting steel was then heard throughout the vicinity. And when the 
dust at the sandals of all were settled, Takahiro was unharmed. The two 
violent swordsman serving Lord Satou stood silently in confusion as 
another made their appearance. One swift enough to deflect the slash. It 
was the stranger in the straw-basin hat. 

With a drawn katana in hand, the stranger spoke to the castle samurai 
with a surprisingly light tone of voice. &quot;That is enough. You have every 
right to carry out Kirisutogomen upon this man after the comments he 
just made. But would you do so before the eyes of his innocent sister? 
Before the eyes of these common folk? Your duty is to defend the daimyo 
and set good example for those below your station, is it not? Then with 
all do respect, please display your eminence with mercy. Such a thing 
would contradict the claims of this man... and prevent a needless 
bloodshed, which, considering the severe expressions of the people 
around us; is something preferred.&quot;

The second of the castle samurai sneered. Not only was this person 
armed, but also well spoken. &quot;...Who are you? You bare arms, do you not? 
State your name and business here!&quot;

The cloaked stranger lowered their sword and sheathed it swiftly, 
revealing, if only for a brief moment, the fact that they wore the 
daisho in full. &quot;...I have not come here for a fight. I am merely a 
bystander. But I would appreciate it if nothing more were said of this 
matter. Even if it means losing face...&quot;

The first castle samurai growled and lifted his blade upwards to provoke 
the stranger But when he did, the tip of his blade fell off. Takahiro, 
Nanase, and the two swordsmen looked on in disbelief. This stranger had 
hacked straight through the blade with no more than a sole stroke. The 
looks of arrogance on the faces of the two warriors then changed into 
ones of shock and horror. The stranger noticed this, but from the tone 
of voice used, did not seem to relish such a display of their own power. 

&quot;Like I said,&quot; claimed the stranger, &quot;I do not wish for a fight So 
please forgive the incursion of indignity by this man... on this 
occasion We needn&#39;t carry this out any further.&quot;

The looks in their eyes suggested that this wasn&#39;t quite over yet, but 
it was foreshadowed by their following act. The two men rushed away, 
back into the direction of Katsubana-jo, the castle of the town. The 
villagers around were all stunned by this. Kirisutogomen was not a 
common act here, but it did happen from time to time. And on none of 
occasions did a castle samurai back down from the blade of a passer-by. 
But while the townsfolk went back to their everyday business, Nanase 
breathed a sigh of relief. Takahiro smiled and stood up from the ground, 
bowing to the stranger who had saved his life from the two swordsmen. 

Nanase was the first to address the traveller, however. &quot;Thank you so 
much, sir&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not often the castle bushi turn tail and run like that,&quot; Takahiro 
added, &quot;you must be quite a swordsman to resist such an attack, too. The 
samurai of Hyuga are famed across the land for being experts in street 
swordsmanship. But compared to you... so just who are you, sir?&quot;

The stranger lifted the straw hat from their head. And when Nanase and 
Takahiro saw the face of the one who had aided them, they both gasped. 
Not only was this person younger than Takahiro, that &#39;person&#39;... was 
female. &quot;...I am Shinmyouji Hinata of the Ennoichi Clan.&quot;

Takahiro&#39;s smile transformed swiftly into a scowl. &quot;A woman? A woman who 
bears the daisho? Is this a joke?&quot;

The wide green eyes of the woman known as &#39;Hinata&#39; were closed in an 
intrinsic understanding of this man&#39;s point of view. She didn&#39;t agree 
with it. But things on mainland Nippon were never quite as simple as 
they were for her back home. A fact that her teachers never 
underestimated when they spoke of it. Not even... her. Hinata rested her 
straw hat back on her head and addressed the feisty Takahiro. 

&quot;I do not expect you to understand in any case,&quot; Claimed Hinata, &quot;but do 
you wish me to explain?&quot;

Takahiro scowled at that again. &quot;Save it. I have no need for your 
explanations. What madness has befallen Nippon? To allow women such as 
yourself the right to bear arms and honest, hardworking men like myself 
denied?&quot;

Hinata smiled. The Tokugawa didn&#39;t &#39;allow&#39; the adoption of the daisho to 
women, either. At least not outside the defence of the home. But a man 
such as this would never see the situation for what it was. Takahiro was 
still unwilling to listen to or even thank Hinata, and turned away from 
her in that moment, snorting. 

&quot;I&#39;m going home, Nanase,&quot; He told his sister, &quot;Are you coming?&quot;

Nanase shook her head with a frown. &quot;I wish to thank Miss Shinmyouji.&quot;

Takahiro shook his head in exasperation. &quot;Do as you wish.&quot;

He then stomped off down the dirt tracks of the village. Towards his 
home on the edge of town. Both Hinata and Nanase watched him stalk off, 
but Nanase was the one most concerned. She was sure that fiery temper of 
her brother&#39;s was going to get him in trouble one day. But she could now 
at least amend his mistakes. Nanase turned to Hinata and bowed politely 
to her brother&#39;s saviour. 

&quot;Many thanks for what you did,&quot; Said the girl, &quot;and forgive my brother&#39;s 
rudeness. He really is under a lot of pressure. All the work on the land 
is getting to him. But... I must admit... it seems odd that a woman like 
myself carries swords.&quot;

Hinata nodded. &quot;I know. These lands are very set in their ways when it 
comes to this. And you needn&#39;t thank me. I did what anyone else would do 
in the given situation. Now... I need to find an Inn for the night.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Nanase immediately kneeled down at the sandaled feet of Hinata, 
prostrating herself upon the dusty ground, &quot;please, do not say such a 
thing! I beg you to except a token of my thanks! Please spend the night 
with my brother and I at our home! We do not have much in the way of 
food but I assure you, we will prepare something good for you to partake 
of! Please, Miss Shinmyouji, please stay with us.&quot;

Well Hinata couldn&#39;t say that she didn&#39;t like the thought of saving some 
of her money (what little she had anyway). &quot;...I do not think I would be 
very welcome at your home. Surely Takahiro would protest?&quot;

&quot;Do not concern yourself with my brother,&quot; Nanase put forth, &quot;the deed 
to our Father&#39;s home was left in his name. But even he would not refuse 
if he knew how important it was for me to do this. Please, Miss 
Shinmyouji&quot;

Hinata backed down in the end. Refusing her offer to stay would be rude 
now. And if it meant saving more ryo for her journey then she would have 
to do so. The female samurai kneeled herself and placed a hand on 
Nanase&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Arise. If it means this much to you, then, I would 
be very honoured if you would allow me to board with you for the night.&quot;

The cute and innocent smile on Nanase&#39;s face widened when she raised her 
head It meant a lot to her for Hinata to understand her gratitude. Even 
though her brother was a headstrong man, she loved him with her whole 
heart and soul. Hinata&#39;s saving of him put Nanase in her debt. And she 
felt it was her duty to repay part of that debt.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ 

&quot;As I said before, we do not have much. But please feel free to treat my 
home as if it were your own.&quot;

At the centre of the small eating quarters of Nanase and Takahiro&#39;s home 
there was a small wooden table. Upon that table were a pair of worn 
chopsticks and a steaming bowl of rice. Just enough to fill the bowl to 
its rim. Topping off that bowl were a few wild peppers that had been 
cooked in oil. It was a small amount of food for anyone of Edo or Kyoto 
life. But in the famine-stricken regions to the far north and south, 
such a meal was considered large. Hinata bobbed her head with thanks to 
the beautiful young woman Nanase, whom had prepared this for her. Then 
she assumed the seiza and separated the sticks. Hinata plucked out a 
portion of the rise and ate. Nanase looked to see her reaction. A small 
smile was tugged from the quiet Hinata&#39;s lips. Indicating to the other 
girl that her cooking was up to snuff. While she ate, the brown-haired 
samurai looked around this small three-part home she was now in. This 
place was surprising well kept and furnished. The floors were smooth 
polished boards, and the structure of the building was firm on wood. It 
was quite unlike the ramshackle homes of other peasantry. But there was 
one thing that Hinata took deep notice of. Across from them on the other 
side of the room was a little stone shrine which held up two swords. A 
sheathed katana and a sheathed wakizashi. They looked to be of a fine 
make. More than just a piece of ornamental paraphernalia. It took a 
moment for Nanase to realize that Hinata was staring at the two swords 
while she ate.

But the cook soon caught on. &quot;Are you wondering about those?&quot;

&quot;...Yes,&quot; Hinata affirmed, &quot;are they...?&quot;

&quot;Battle swords? Uh huh. They belonged to my Father. And also his Father. 
In fact, those two swords, Gouken and Goutetsu, have been passed down my 
family for generations. You see they belonged to our ancestors. Who 
fought in the Sekigahara battle more than 200 years ago. The swords were 
then handed down our family for years. Until the famine in the north 
forced us to flee to the south. However after the leave, my grandfather 
was discovered to have been born a bastard. Which meant that he could 
not wield our family&#39;s swords. Our family line was expelled But the 
legitimate line died out eventually. It left the swords in our hands, 
but... we are still forbidden by tradition to use them.&quot;

Hinata finished chewing on one batch of rice. &quot;I see. So you belong to a 
samurai family, do you?&quot;

&quot;Well, we used to,&quot; Nanase replied, &quot;when our bloodline was declared 
illegitimate we were forced into poverty. And since no one of that 
lineage was left to us, my brother and I have no real choice but to live 
like this. Now we are forbidden to even use our own family name.&quot;

It was a story that Hinata understood. And it explained things. Like the 
finesse of their home. Or how someone as articulate and mannerly as 
Nanase and Takahiro could live amongst the peasantry so seamlessly. The 
famines and the heavy taxation on the land and its people had done much 
to cause tragedies such as these. While the Hyuga region was doing 
fairly well for itself, other places were not so lucky. A new layer of 
discontent and anger was boiling inside the people. Fuelling energetic 
young men like Takahiro to take a stand. Ever since the Hitotsubashi 
line of the Tokugawa had inherited control over the shogunate, that 
rabid entity of ire had been growing. A unified voice, particularly in 
the south, was taking shape. One that called for greater understanding 
of the plight of the hyakushou, more lenient levels of taxation, better 
freedom of movement, and an end to the rising levels of corruption rife 
in the heart of the bakufu. Nippon was reaching a new age One where the 
former firm strength of shogunate was beginning to unravel. People were 
looking towards Kyoto and the Emperor now. They were a silent and covert 
force But Hinata knew in her heart that they were a force that was 
deeply prevalent in society. 

But she also knew that Nanase was not concerned with those details. Her 
mind was firmly set on the safety of her brother. As it was, family was 
the only thing left in the world that remained truly precious. 

...In any case. 

&quot;This rice is delicious.&quot; Hinata complimented.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ 

To the northeast of the Natsumura village residential area was the small 
but beautiful castle known as Katsubana-jo. The castle from which this 
han&#39;s daimyo, Satou Genpachiro, ran the business of the region. Along 
the short and sturdy ishigaki of the outer courtyard, stood the castle 
guards of famed repute in the village. Beneath the protection of the 
swords and fire sticks of over eighty foot guards, the daimyo was 
considered untouchable in the han. At least from the peasants 

In the keep of the castle, the central building of the compound, was the 
meeting hall where the daimyo himself would speak with his advisors and 
those who wished to have audience with him. Katsubana-jo&#39;s meeting hall 
was of the same extravagant style as the rest of the castle. Full of 
poetic wall scrolls on life and the teachings of Zen. It was generally 
known that Lord Satou was an incompetent swordsman, but his zealous 
admiration of the art didn&#39;t seem to be fazed by it. In this day and 
age, the daimyo had little need even to study combat techniques. Such 
was the strength of the Bakufu&#39;s enforced peace. Satou sat on the small 
oak relief chair at the head of the hall, while his eight most loyal 
retainers sat by the walls in the seiza, four to the left and four to 
the right. Satou tapped his fan against his knee whilst watching the two 
other men in that room. The two samurai who had threatened to kill the 
young man Takahiro in the village. They both kneeled before their master 
loyally. In their hearts they knew what was about to happen here.

Satou&#39;s eyes rolled down to the prone men just five metres ahead of his 
feet &quot;Let me comprehend this. An unknown swordsman interfered with the 
implementation of my laws and you allowed that said man to walk away on 
two able legs?&quot;

The second castle guard lowered his head. &quot;...I am sorry, milord. It was 
wrong of us to flee.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Agreed the first, the castle warden, &quot;I apologize, sir&quot;

Satou frowned menacingly at the pair of them. &quot;What pathetic, disloyal 
bushi have I nourished in the confides of my own castle, to allow their 
lord to be debased in public like this?&quot;

&quot;We have no excuse,&quot; Claimed the first swordsman, &quot;but the skills of 
that samurai were of such a fine calibre... I do believe we would have 
met with defeat if we were to...&quot;

Then he silenced himself, knowing what he had just revealed. And that 
was the end of that. The surrounding retainers stared at the two with 
anger and pity, while Satou looked away with a pompous snort. With one 
slap of his knee by the closed fan, the daimyo had cast his verdict upon 
the two. &quot;You both have displeased me. Ascend to Buddha&#39;s grace if you 
wish to assuage my anger.&quot;

The look of sadness and understanding was mirrored on the faces of the 
failed bushi They knew what they had to do now. The first one nodded to 
the lord and withdrew the wakizashi of his arms. He held his sword in a 
two-handed grip, poised before his torso with the tip of the blade 
pressing against his lower stomach. The castle warden grit his teeth and 
thrust the blade inwards. It stabbed through his kimono and into his 
belly. Blood now began darkening the blue material of his bodily 
clothing But it was merely a superficial wound. The look of agony on the 
face of the nameless warden grew when he slowly dragged the sharp edge 
of the blade across the stretch of his stomach, gradually increasing the 
length of the wound and blood-flow from said wound. Inch by inch he 
sliced open his own belly, ripping apart flesh on the edge of cold 
steel. Until it was no more. Blood gushed downwards from the folds of 
the warden&#39;s kimono, seeping onto the mat he kneeled on. Eventually his 
eyes became bloodshot. And the weakness of his grip on his sword became 
evident from the shaking of his hands. He coughed up shots of blood 
which splattered over his chest and the floor. Moments later he toppled 
over before the sight of the lord and his eight retainers, as well as 
the fellow samurai beside him.

Lord Satou&#39;s gaze turned to him, also. And the second samurai, stunned 
by the death and courage of the first, knew his task. He breathed a deep 
breath and withdrew his katana from its sheath. Like the one before him 
he stabbed himself with a shallow blow on one side of his stomach. And 
following that he dragged the blade across In one bloody, painful and 
faintly ritualistic act, the second man took his life Only to have his 
lifeless upper torso collapse into a pool of his own blood. 

Lord Satou rolled his eyes once more. It was not the first time he had 
had his men perform sokotsu-shi via seppuku in the name of his public 
honour, and it would not be the last. His indifference was quite telling 
of the fact. &quot;So. Tell me. Was what they spoke of true? Was this 
nameless warrior as skilled as they seem to have suggested?&quot;

One of his loyal retainers nodded, answering. &quot;Yes, sir. The man is of a 
small build but was rather quick according to our eyewitness accounts. 
It has been merely a few hours since the altercation but some of our 
sources suggest that the people have been rather vocal about it.&quot;

&quot;Confounded fools,&quot; Satou sneered, &quot;like lost sheep they scuttle to the 
heels of anyone akin to the shepherd. They already have that blasted 
Kagami boy fuelling their imagination. Now another seeks to assume the 
same position?! Tell me, who is this interloper?&quot;

&quot;That is unknown, sir,&quot; Remarked one of the other retainers, &quot;this man 
appears to be a mere ronin. But the circumstances behind that fate are 
as yet a mystery to us. All we know about him is that he is skilled. 
Perhaps more so than Kagami Hayate is.&quot;

Lord Satou growled under his breath. &quot;Is that so? Well then. Like any 
other problematic brigand, I will have to make an example of him. 
Assemble a small group of men. No more than four or five. Then send them 
out to the village. Once this ronin is spotted I want him killed in that 
instant.&quot;

It was an understood order. The people were in need of a light to guide 
them throughout what they believed to be darkness. If insurrection was 
to be prevented then that light had to be snuffed out before anyone was 
aroused by it. Meanwhile, the lord had other issues to attend to.

Satou, confidently ignoring the warm corpses that were now spreading 
their blood all over the floor of his meeting hall, slapped his thigh 
with his fan and spoke up again. &quot;Regardless of that. How goes the 
plan?&quot;

Another of the retainers answered him. &quot;All is well, sir. No one 
suspects a thing The strengthening of rice production has increased 
significantly since last year&#39;s harvests. The value of that surplus will 
be magnified once the rice is sold to the struggling regions around us.&quot;

&quot;Perfect,&quot; Claimed the daimyo, &quot;those vile, bastard chonin are good for 
something at least. An excess of 5,500 koku would certainly improve my 
standing as a daimyo of the bakuhan... by why let the shogunate loot our 
coffers with a higher tansen in result of that? The amount of ryo to be 
generated from this endeavour would go towards the strengthening of the 
han as well as my house. As long as we keep our wits about us...&quot;

&quot;However, sir,&quot; When another of the eight retainers addressed him, Satou 
turned to his left and heard the continuation of what he wanted to say, 
&quot;we must be very alert now. One of our spies in the capital have 
discovered that a ninja has been deployed to Hyuga. Seemingly with the 
purpose of investigating the unrest of the villagers. While this may or 
may not be true, it should stand to notice that the supposed shadow is 
of the Kakatsuki Ninja Group.&quot;

A chorus of whispers emanated from the mouths of the seven other 
retainers. Lord Satou slapped his leg with his fan again to silence 
them. Then questioned the comment &quot;Do you mean the blood descendants of 
the remnant ninja forces of Iga?&quot;

The retainer nodded. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

Satou mused on this new detail. The Kakatsuki Ninja Group were the 
progeny of the Iga ninja power-base. The one that was so ruthlessly 
smashed by the legendary Oda Nobunaga. Rumours had been rife that the 
shogunate now used the Kakatsuki Ninja Teams in secret to help maintain 
the force of the bakuhan through reconnaissance Now it seemed that those 
rumours were quite true. But Satou just smiled, plucking at one end of 
his thin moustache. &quot;You all needn&#39;t worry. If the bakufu has levied the 
mobilization of a shinobi to investigate Natsumura, we will simply have 
to step up our efforts. And if that ninja happens to discover 
something... they will have to be disposed of...&quot;

His sight then turned to the south of the room, as did the sight of the 
retainers. They all looked to the door which was slid open to allow some 
other person in. A samurai. Fully dressed in the kamishimo, but owning 
only one lengthened sword, a nodachi called the Izata, this man 
chuckled. His head lowered with the action which caused his gigantic 
mane of smog-green spiky hair to thrash behind him. Though the looks of 
disgust on the faces of the retainers proved that he was not well liked, 
the smouldering emerald aura about the person of the samurai clearly 
showed his strength. This man was Minagawa Ryouichi. But he was better 
known to people by the nickname of &#39;Teppo Satsujin-hannin&#39;. The Gun 
Murderer. And he was now the current Yojimbo of Lord Satou himself. 

&quot;Heh, heh, heh,&quot; Laughed the sneaky Satou, &quot;the Shogun may illustrate 
his dominance over the other daimyo with his thousand eyes... but if 
worst comes to worst... I&#39;ll just have to pluck out one of those eyes.&quot;
