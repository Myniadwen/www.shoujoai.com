as she was walking out the door, &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be gone
too long.&quot;

Lisa smiled back, the black haired woman nodding
respectfully to the senior maid. &quot;Everything should be
fine,&quot; she said to her reassuringly, &quot;enjoy your night
out.&quot;

&quot;Keep an eye on Laur&#39;ien,&quot; Elise cautioned the two of
them, &quot;I still don&#39;t quite trust her, bodyguard or
no.&quot;

&quot;We will,&quot; Chris promised, the smaller brunette waving
as Elise left.

Elise walked from the home, feeling a small flash of
guilt as she left. She was loyal to the Duchess, and
always would be, but she also knew how much Jantha
would disapprove of where she was going to today.
Traveling down the streets she made her way from the
wealthier section of town to the merchant&#39;s quarter,
eventually reaching a middle class home.

&quot;Yes?&quot; the voice asked as Elise knocked.

&quot;All are made equal,&quot; Elise answered with the secret
phrase.

&quot;About time you got here,&quot; the redhead smiled as she
swung open the front door. &quot;Most of the others have
arrived,&quot; she said.

&quot;Sorry, Terri,&quot; Elise said and followed Terri in, &quot;I
had to finish cleaning up after a diplomatic meeting
in the mistress&#39; home.&quot;

&quot;Better not mention it to the others,&quot; Terri said as
they walked through the front hallway, &quot;or they&#39;re
going to want a detailed report.&quot; They entered a large
sitting room where several other ladies waited,
several of them calling greetings as they came in.

The Countess Hazan stood off to one side, the tall
black haired woman dressed as usual in her men&#39;s
trousers and a simple blouse, while Ra&#39;hel longed
beside her lover dressed in a skirt that was
reminiscent of her days as a street walker. Celia,
called by some the merchant queen, fidgeted in a chair
nearby the fire, her brown hair shimmering in the
candle light. Terri made the final member of their
band, representing many of the younger noblewomen who
chafed under their parent&#39;s strict rule.

&quot;Thank you all for coming,&quot; Hazan said calmly, &quot;I call
this meeting of the leaders of the Guild of
Gentlewomen to order.&quot;

&quot;The first item of business is recruiting,&quot; Ra&#39;hel
spoke up with a wry smile, &quot;as you can see I&#39;ve been
busy with the street walkers and high class
courtesans. They&#39;re getting very angry over their
treatment of late, especially by the new recruits in
the Queens Guard, I think if we help them, they&#39;ll
help us.&quot;

&quot;But how much of a help will they be?&quot; Celia frowned.
Her own vision of the Guild of Gentlewoman had never
included such common women as prostitutes or hire
swords, and she was dubious about bringing them in.

&quot;Just for blackmail purposes alone they&#39;ll be a great
help to us,&quot; Terri noted cynically. She flashed a
wicked smile as she added, &quot;I&#39;m sure my noble mother
would be shocked to know of my dear father&#39;s
activities.&quot;

&quot;Terri,&quot; Celia frown disapprovingly at the younger
woman

&quot;I&#39;ve been carefully feeling out the servants of
several noble houses,&quot; Elise jumped in to draw Celia&#39;s
attention away from Terri and smiled as she said, &quot;I
think I&#39;ve got several convinced to join our cause.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Hazan flashed a confident smile, &quot;they&#39;ll be a
good source of information.&quot;

Elise winced, wondering if that was a barb aimed at
her. She was a member of the Guild but had told Hazan
directly that she would not reveal secrets of her
mistress&#39; house nor try to influence her. Hazan seemed
to accept that, but Elise still wondered if she really
meant it.

Celia said a bit stiffly, &quot;The business women of the
city are behind us, and I&#39;ve got contacts recruiting
among the wagoners coming in to the kingdom.&quot;

&quot;How are we doing for total numbers?&quot; Terri asked
curiously.

&quot;It&#39;s hard to determine a exact number,&quot; Hazan
admitted before saying, &quot;I&#39;d say we have a few hundred
committed members, possibly more if we get a charter
from the queen.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the rub,&quot; Elise admitted, &quot;without a charter
we cannot sit in on the councils of our kingdom&#39;s
rulers or influence policy.&quot;

&quot;Has there been any progress on that?&quot; Celia asked
pointedly, looking from Elise over to Hazan and
Ra&#39;hel.

&quot;The Queen has agreed in principle to granting us a
charter,&quot; Hazan said to them with a triumphant grin
then became more serious as she added, &quot;but she warns
there&#39;ll be a great deal of hardship to be faced.&quot;

&quot;As in?&quot; Terri blinked.

&quot;Many husbands and fathers will be quite upset by this
and may try to take it out on the daughters and wives
involved,&quot; Ra&#39;hel said dryly, &quot;we&#39;d best be ready to
support each other when that happens.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Celia nodded, knowing how her own
husband was like to react. She smiled wryly, &quot;Wonder
if I should hire a bodyguard after the announcement is
made?&quot;

&quot;I can think of a few cute lady hire swords,&quot; Terri
smirked.

Celia sniffed, &quot;I don&#39;t go that way, child.&quot;

Terri grinned back, &quot;Your loss.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go THAT far,&quot; Elise said, &quot;but I would be
wary, none the less.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Celia nodded. She looked to Hazan
respectfully, &quot;When will the Queen make the
announcement?&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow,&quot; Hazan said, &quot;we should start spreading the
word to our high level supports. Just don&#39;t tell them
to spread the word yet.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ra&#39;hel asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t quite trust the word of a noble,&quot; Hazan
admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t want to risk disappointing our
friends if she has lied.&quot;

&quot;Her word is her bond,&quot; even Terri sounded surprised
that Hazan might think the Queen had lied to them.

&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean her advisors might not force her to
go back on her word,&quot; Elise had to reluctantly add.

&quot;True,&quot; Celia said with a frown. She rose from her
seat gracefully, &quot;But either way, I think we&#39;re done
for tonight?&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; Hazan said with a polite
nod as Celia left.

Ra&#39;hel also got up, her skirts swirling around her
long legs. &quot;We&#39;d be best going too, m&#39;love,&quot; she said.

&quot;Excuse me for a moment,&quot; Hazan said, gesturing for
Terri and Ra&#39;hel to leave.

Terri frowned but nodded, &quot;Don&#39;t take too long,
ma&#39;am.&quot;

Elise met Hazan&#39;s gaze calmly once the other women
left, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Did you bring up the possibility of the Queen
changing her mind intentionally?&quot; Hazan asked,
swirling her drink around in it&#39;s cup.

&quot;I won&#39;t discuss what goes on in my mistress&#39; house,&quot;
Elise met her eyes defiantly, &quot;but I can say that she
has not so advised the Queen.&quot; A wry smile, &quot;The
Duchess may dislike you, but she doesn&#39;t oppose our
cause.&quot;

Hazan relaxed a little, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;I mentioned it because her advisors likely think this
is a dangerous move for her to make,&quot; Elise relaxed a
bit as she continued, &quot;we both know it&#39;s a gamble,
especially with everything else that&#39;s going on.&quot;

&quot;War, quite possibly,&quot; Hazan agreed. &quot;I had to pledge
our support for that, in exchange for our chance to
become a recognized guild.&quot;

&quot;Celia will be most upset when she finds out you
promised that,&quot; Elise predicted.

&quot;I&#39;ll cross that bridge when we come to it,&quot; Hazan
said with a shrug. She picked up her coat, &quot;Thank
you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Elise sighed as Hazan quietly left.

Terri rushed back in once Hazan was gone, hurrying to
Elise as she asked, &quot;She didn&#39;t try to pressure
you...?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Elise quickly reassured her.

&quot;Thank goodness,&quot; Terri took Elise&#39;s hands in hers as
she said, &quot;I couldn&#39;t bear it if she mistreated you.&quot;

&quot;Terri,&quot; Elise smiled shyly, squeezing her hands in
hers.

A blush colored Terri&#39;s cheeks, the younger woman
looking into Elise&#39;s eyes. &quot;You know,&quot; she said to her
quietly, &quot;I actually ask that tonight&#39;s meeting be
held in my father&#39;s home in the city.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Elise asked, though she suspected she knew why.

&quot;I wanted to see you outside our meetings,&quot; Terri
smiled, &quot;the few times I&#39;ve talked to you, I&#39;ve found
you most charming.&quot;

Elise hesitated a moment, then nodded slightly. &quot;I&#39;m
not expected back til later,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;d love to
stay and talk a bit.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Terri squeezed her hand gently again.</pre>
