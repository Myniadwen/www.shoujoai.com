<h1>All Girls School (part 104 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch103.html">Back to Part 103</a><pre>Long ago in a distant land, I, Aku, the shape-shifting master of 
darkness, unleashed an unspeakable evil! But a foolish samurai warrior, 
wielding a magic sword, stepped forth to oppose me! Before the final 
blow was struck, I tore open a portal in time, and flung him into the 
future, where my evil is law! Now the fool seeks to return to the past, 
and undo the future that is Aku!

&quot;Samurai Yuki&quot;

Cicadas pierced the silent early day like needles, their whistling 
rhythmically weaving in a slow tempo. Above, the gray sky yawned, its 
sun obscured by dusty clouds; below, the world shivered itself out of 
the cold, grassy dew dripping down to sprinkle small beetles. A small 
lizard scurried across, looking for holes to burrow in until the day 
grew warmer; dragonflies soared safely above his grasp, their own eyes 
seeking shelter from the weary first hours of the day. This was a 
tranquility not meant to be disturbed&#151;and yet of all places, Yuki and 
Aku chose to fight here.

Yuki sailed backwards through the air, suffering a mighty swipe from 
Aku&#39;s claws, and skidded to a rough stop upon the grass that had only 
just woken up. Dust from the earth gathered and slowly settled; Aku 
laughed as Yuki laid there, motionless and powerless to get up.

&quot;Once again, samurai, your foolish attempts to destroy me are wasted!&quot; 
growled the black demon. He loomed over Yuki like an obelisk, blocking 
out the pale sun&#151;and grinned. &quot;This time, there will be a price to be 
paid for your efforts. I shall destroy you here and now, and make known 
my unquestioned domination throughout the land!&quot; Aku transformed his 
claw into a very long, very sharp spear, and lunged it at Yuki with the 
might of a thunderbolt. That last blow had taken a heavy toll on the 
ronin, but Yuki was in no way completely defenseless. Gritting her 
teeth, she rolled to the side at the last second, ignored her pain as 
she swung her sword, and struck a gash across Aku&#39;s deadly tendril. The 
black mass was cleaved in two, the smaller part sailing off and 
vanishing in smoke. Needless to say, Aku wasn&#39;t too pleased.

&quot;As long as there exists even a fiber of strength left in my body, Aku,&quot; 
Yuki declared boldly, &quot;I shall not submit to defeat!&quot; Aku growled with 
hate, and even though he had never seen a better opportunity to 
exterminate this bothersome pest, Yuki didn&#39;t look like she was going to 
back down without a fight.

&quot;You overestimate your skills, samurai,&quot; muttered Aku, his voice dark. 
&quot;But I am feeling generous after all. If it weren&#39;t for more pressing 
matters, I would engage you to the death. But remember, my strength 
increases every day.&quot;

&quot;Twice the pride, double the fall,&quot; Yuki retorted. Aku snarled and took 
one last swipe; he slashed Yuki&#39;s chest, but Yuki cut Aku&#39;s arm. The two 
enemies yowled in pain, and the dark wizard retreated back into the hole 
he emerged from. Yuki stood watch for a moment, waiting for complete 
solidarity, and with a heavy effort, sheathed her sword&#151;and stumbled. 
That last battle had taken more out of her than she thought she had. Of 
course, Aku had been wounded as well, so maybe postponing their 
so-called epic struggle was the wise thing to do.

Somehow, Yuki trudged her way to a local village and found an inn where 
she could rest up, patch her wounds, and reformulate her strategy. So, 
even after everything she had been through, Aku still had a few tricks 
up his evil sleeves, and enough fight in him to challenge her. She had 
to wonder if what he said was true: was he really becoming stronger day 
by day? If that was true, then as Aku surpassed his own powers, so too 
would Yuki. She would just have to become stronger, last longer, and 
have the truer heart. But within her weary psyche, she knew that this 
could never be enough.

She could not kill Aku by herself. She would need help.

The only person Yuki trusted was the Scotsman, but he came and went as 
he pleased, and their meetings always seemed to be more coincidental 
than planned. She then wondered if she could recruit new friends to help 
in her struggle, but that was a risky venture. Would she dare show her 
face so publicly, advertise her cause, and hope for the best? The legend 
of Samurai Yuki might be enough to draw a few noble-hearted allies, but 
would it also be enough to pay them? Yuki didn&#39;t want to trudge back to 
all those towns and people who owed her a debt, either, so it looked 
like she only had that one other option.

There weren&#39;t any towns or cities in the world that were completely 
devoid of Aku&#39;s influence, but there were plenty that were secretly in 
opposition to his movement. Yuki knew of at least three off the bat, and 
one of those was only a few days&#39; journey from where she was. There 
didn&#39;t seem to be a point in hurrying there, so she hiked the whole way, 
packing food and skins of water for her long trip. The sun and the moon 
wheeled gradually across the sky along the way; the daytime star turned 
from a soupy white color to a bright, merry yellow by the time Yuki 
arrived in the new town, and the moon smiled that same crescent grin she 
was so familiar with.

Unfortunately, she had no idea where to begin looking. Somehow, fortune 
was with her that day.

......

&quot;Tell me one more time,&quot; sighed the dark-skinned limping woman to her 
companions: &quot;Why exactly are we here?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve already told you a gazillion times, Liv,&quot; sighed the only blonde 
in the bunch. &quot;We know you&#39;re new to this group, but that doesn&#39;t excuse 
you from forgetting our quest.&quot;

&quot;I just want to make sure I understand all this,&quot; she replied, straining 
to keep her civility. Blondie pinched her lips together in annoyance&#151;her 
comrades would have to do the talking for her.

&quot;Basically, we&#39;re looking for warriors to help with our little 
problems,&quot; spoke the brunette of the group. &quot;You know how Alexis and I 
set out together to find like souls for this task, and we came across 
you and Rozy. But we need a fifth, as our last battle attested.&quot;

&quot;And you think we&#39;ll find this fifth here in this run-down city?&quot; asked 
Liv. The brunette shrugged.

&quot;It&#39;s as good a place as any.&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s just nice.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be in such a sour mood,&quot; Blondie reprimanded. &quot;We both came along 
willingly, didn&#39;t we? And we&#39;ve both proved ourselves in battle. After 
that last injury you sustained, we&#39;re going to need this fifth player 
more than ever.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so I&#39;m useless?&quot;

&quot;No, Liv,&quot; said the fourth member of their bunch, a laid-back woman, 
slightly heavyset, with hazy eyes and dark hair. &quot;We always put stock 
and value in something. You&#39;re our demolitions girl. That leg won&#39;t 
hinder you at all while you&#39;re setting explosives and firing rocket 
launchers, now will it?&quot;

&quot;It might,&quot; she bit back. Blondie and Brunette exchanged a weary look. 
Not even two days on the road together, and already there was friction. 
If the fifth warrior they were hoping for was anything like this crew...

&quot;Excuse me, ladies,&quot; came a polite voice across from them. The four 
girls looked over and noticed somebody was hailing them. White gi, black 
hair tied in a topknot, a straw hat, a sword at her side and 
old-fashioned wooden sandals over her feet... Why, if they didn&#39;t know 
any better, they&#39;d say she matched the description of...

&quot;Yes, us?&quot;

&quot;Pardon me,&quot; said the woman, bowing politely, &quot;but I was wondering if 
the four of you would know where I can find honorable mercenaries for 
some work.&quot; The women looked at each other in shock, all of them 
thinking the same thing. Blondie chuckled and rubbed her chin.

&quot;The river of fate cuts a strange and winding path,&quot; she mused. Turning 
to the stranger, she returned the bow. &quot;My dear friend, it seems that 
destiny has favored our meeting, for we are also in need of strong 
warriors. Perhaps we could help each other out.&quot;

Samurai Yuki hadn&#39;t counted on it being that easy. But then again, she 
had spent a few days and nights here. So her father had been right: 
patience really was a virtue.

&quot;I would be honored,&quot; she told them. &quot;Let me introduce mys&#151;&quot;

&quot;Samurai Yuki, right?&quot; asked the heavyset woman. &quot;Yeah, we know all 
about you. What a strange stroke of fortune that we ran into you! Now 
those alien troublemakers won&#39;t stand a chance against us! The name&#39;s 
Alexis,&quot; she said, extending for hand. &quot;My specialty is knives and bad 
jokes.&quot;

&quot;Forgive her,&quot; said the blonde, smiling politely. &quot;She&#39;s an attention 
freak. I&#39;m Rozalia, the elected leader of this band.&quot;

&quot;Ancelin,&quot; nodded the brunette simply. She bowed just as politely as 
Yuki had.

&quot;(Annie here won&#39;t admit it,) whispered Rozalia, &quot;(but her specialty is 
spy crap and sex!)&quot; Everyone heard it, including Ancelin, who blushed 
furiously (the others just laughed). Yuki turned red too, but decided to 
press on and ignore it.

&quot;And...this lady?&quot;

&quot;Olivia,&quot; said she, bowing awkwardly. &quot;The demolitions expert. Don&#39;t let 
the dour attitude and the limp throw you off; I&#39;m pretty handy in a 
fight.&quot; Yuki smiled and told them all how honored she was to be in their 
company, and so thankful that they could assist with each other&#39;s needs. 
They didn&#39;t stay in town very long: now that everyone had what they were 
looking for, it was back to life on the road. While they were traveling, 
the four girls explained to Yuki their dilemma.

&quot;Y&#39;see, awhile back, an alien attack force landed in Ancelin and 
Alexis&#39;s village. They did some damage, took some people captive, and 
set up a system of martial law. Annie and Alex escaped and came to Liv 
and I for help. Being the gracious experts we were&#151;and let&#39;s face it, 
who hasn&#39;t felt the sting of those oppressive beasts&#151;we set ourselves 
into helping them. One huge fight later, and we realize we need a fifth. 
That&#39;s where you came in.&quot;

&quot;And there&#39;s no need to tell us your story, Lady Yuki,&quot; said Ancelin 
with a smile. &quot;We already know of it. Whatever we can do, the four of us 
will help you destroy Aku&#151;even if it means we will not exist in this 
future. It&#39;s better to never live than to suffer through this dystopia.&quot; 
Everyone was in agreement on that, and even though Yuki had never 
considered that kind of consequence before&#151;destroying Aku here, and in 
the past, would no doubt change this future radically&#151;she resigned 
herself to her destiny.

.........

The celestial gears continued to crank, from night to day and back 
again, as the team of five traveled far to the realm of the oppressed. 
In that time, each of them shared stories of their lives as villagers, 
mercenaries, warriors, and experts. It was pleasant, in an unusual way, 
that such a mismatched team could be assembled like that: a woman with a 
knack for leadership, a sensual French-Korean spy, an expert 
knife-thrower and fighter, a demolitions master, and now the samurai, 
Yuki. It was common knowledge that disasters had a way of bringing 
unlikely people together, and what was more disastrous than an alien 
force invading one&#39;s home&#151;except for the omnipresence of Aku?

The village where Ancelin and Alexis were born and raised in was heavily 
guarded: first by thick vegetation, steep cliffs, a raging river, and 
enough natural traps and trails to throw anybody off. The second level 
of protection was colder; the alien forces stood vigil over the gates, 
long jagged spears in their hands. With the combined efforts of the 
five, they weren&#39;t there long.

&quot;Hurry!&quot; Ancelin hissed, &quot;Before more of them show up! We must keep our 
stealth as long as possible.&quot; She didn&#39;t want the whole army bearing 
down on them if she could help it, so that&#39;s why she encouraged everyone 
to be quick and quiet. The team shifted their way behind huts and 
houses, shacks and silos, sneaking and slithering across thick shadows 
gracefully; their destination was the building that held all the 
hostages the aliens had taken. To Yuki, who had seen her fair share of 
odd creatures, they looked little different than blue squid-creatures, 
half their bodies vaguely human and the other half decidedly aquatic. 
They reminded her a bit of the Triceraquin.

&quot;There,&quot; whispered Alexis, indicating a nondescript building. To house 
the hostages somewhere obvious would be like placing searchlights and 
neon signs around for any rebellious punk to come sniffing around. Yuki 
frowned.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Trust me, I know,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I saw my best friend being taken in 
there, and I&#39;m getting her out. Stay here.&quot; Everyone was squatted down 
behind a leafy overgrowth, but even in that awkward position, Alexis was 
able to slip a dagger out of concealment and throw it with perfect 
accuracy. The alien standing guard to the building was dead and gone 
before he even tumbled to the ground. She went ahead first, another 
knife already in her hand and waiting to be tossed, and beckoned for the 
others to follow her to the building. They arrived without incident, and 
Olivia immediately started to work.

&quot;Yuki, Rozy, Alexis, cover me please,&quot; she ordered, kneeling down to 
start construction on a crude bomb. The blast would no doubt attract all 
kinds of attention, but they knew they wouldn&#39;t get very far without a 
fight. They just needed to get there. Whether the guards were lazy, 
sloppy, or otherwise incompetent, they didn&#39;t show their faces until 
Olivia had rigged the bomb and detonated it, blowing down the door. The 
girls (and the hostages inside) all coughed and waved the smoke away, 
glad that nothing else had been splintered.

&quot;You couldn&#39;t&#151;cough, cough&#151;just pick the lock?!&quot; managed Ancelin.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m no&#151;COUGH!&#151;locksmith! Get these people out of here! 
Let&#39;s&#151;cough!&#151;let&#39;s go!&quot; She and the others ushered the hostages out, 
barely registering the chorus of thanks that came with it. Yuki was the 
first to step back outside, and skidded to a halt as she was also the 
first to notice they now had company. And the aliens were not happy at 
all.

&quot;Get them!&quot; shouted a fierce-looking one. Yuki bravely stared down the 
two-dozen or so squid monsters, swinging her sword with epicurean grace 
if any of them got close enough. But there were so many&#151;they outnumbered 
her&#151;she started being smacked and smashed by their tentacles, and more 
importantly, she began to realize that more were coming to aid their 
comrades, and these had weapons. But Samurai Yuki wouldn&#39;t quit yet, not 
until she was dead or victorious. Not until then, and not a moment 
sooner.

But of course she had help. Rozalia took the hostages and led them out 
of the town, taking Ancelin to cover her. Alexis and Olivia were at 
Yuki&#39;s side once their friends made haste, a blaster and a bandolier of 
knives between them. Three of the squid-creatures surrounded Olivia 
first, and in spite of her gamy leg, she rolled between them, planting 
explosive devices on their tentacles. A wobbly jump backwards and a 
press of the detonation later, and three explosions came to her 
satisfaction.

Thwick&#151;thwick&#151;went the knives, and poom-boom went the bodies as Alexis 
knocked down more enemies. Four from behind; duck-turn-slash, and 
another was gone. Lean-kneel-roll-spin-whirl-slash, another gone. 
Thwick, another, and slice! Skin broke open and a trickle of blood came 
out as her shoulder was torn. The monster laughed at her pain. She 
screamed at it and rammed it with her favorite dagger.

Yuki was like a farmer, the squid her harvest, and the sword her sickle. 
The creatures, once so numerous and threatening, declined slowly with 
every swipe of her blade. Tentacles fell off and exploded; bodies were 
torn asunder, their mechanical innards protruding like intestines before 
a spark hit their oil and destroyed them. Yuki was struck down too, and 
tumbled to the floor as brief flashes of pain embraced her body, but all 
she needed to do was strengthen her resolve and glare all the harder.

While these three girls were having all their fun, Ancelin and Rozalia 
managed to finally get the hostages to safety, and armed them with crude 
weapons just in case. They each then turned around to assist their 
friends, but except for a few strays, the battle was practically over by 
the time they arrived. Still, it was satisfying to see them join the 
fray, and even more satisfying to let out a cry of victory. If any of 
the squid-monsters survived this royal thrashing, they soon turned the 
proverbial tail and ran (slithered?) for their lives.

Their cheers, however, were short-lived. A black shadow soon crossed 
their paths, one they all knew. Uh-oh.

&quot;So!&quot; barked Aku, &quot;It seems that every time I extend my arm of darkness, 
one tiny little candle is there to repel it. But here I have five! Has 
the samurai come to realize that she cannot defeat me on her own, or 
does she believe that the extra numbers will avail her? It matters not!&quot; 
he proclaimed, the deep wicked bass voice of his booming. &quot;For, whether 
they come to me in small or great numbers, by droves or legions, I will 
exterminate them all. It has happened before, but with this final act, I 
will make certain that it will not happen again!&quot; And then he cackled, a 
most foul noise.

Yuki flared with righteous anger.

&quot;Aku! If you wish to be destroyed, then continue this rampage! For now I 
have brought four worthy comrades to assist in your downfall. Together, 
we shall be more than a match for you!&quot;

&quot;(The samurai&#39;s cracked!)&quot; murmured Alexis to Ancelin. The brunette just 
smirked.

&quot;(At least she has a high opinion of us,)&quot; came the reply. Aku bleated 
angrily, and attacked, transforming into a terrible crab-monster. Yuki 
dove free, her samurai agility making her light as a flea. The others 
scattered clumsily; Alexis and Olivia attempted to take the monster down 
with their weapons, but of course they proved ineffective. Aku laughed 
at their efforts and swiped at them with his enormous black arm. The 
distraction gave Yuki a fraction of free time, and she took full 
advantage as she rushed at Aku sword-first. He jerked around in 
annoyance, flashed his eyes, and shot beams of heat through his pupils. 
Yuki curved her sword in an arc to deflect the blasts and came in for 
the kill; she and Aku traded blows, claw and sword, for a few quick 
rounds before the samurai was repulsed.

&quot;You see!&quot; laughed Aku. &quot;I grow stronger! And to think that the samurai 
would believe herself safer with even more stooges at her side!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t call us stooges,&quot; Ancelin snarled. She pulled a Something from 
underneath her clothes&#151;a rose-shaped sword, it looked to be&#151;and drove it 
deep into Aku&#39;s billowing body. He snorted and turned around to regard 
the...well, the thorn in his side.

&quot;What is this?&quot; he murmured, more perplexed than in pain. He tugged at 
the object, but it stubbornly clung to him, like a burr or barnacle. 
&quot;Insolent mass of metal trickery!&quot; he cursed, now spitting and raving, 
anything to get the object out. &quot;What foolishness is this?!&quot; Now he was 
enraged; his eyes lit up to burn the interlopers who had came between 
him and his prey. But the girls had seen this attack before, and came 
prepared for it.

As the beam dashed for them, Rozalia quickly held up the largest mirror 
she could carry, perhaps brought from some house, or else hidden on her 
person. The reflective glass performed its purpose beautifully, and shot 
the blast back at Aku, blinding and burning him for awhile. As he 
screamed, Ancelin suddenly threw a whole barrage of her sticky 
rose-swords at Aku, and for good measure, Alexis and Olivia resumed 
their futile attack as well. If nothing else, this distracted Aku for a 
long time&#151;long enough for Yuki to recover, jump up, and rip up the demon 
like he was a Christmas present.

The scream he made was quite delicious.

&quot;NO!!!&quot; he roared. &quot;I WILL NOT LOSE LIKE THIS! I will have victory! I 
shall annihilate you, samurai, and everything you hold dear! Do you hear 
me?! Victory!!&quot;

&quot;Victory, yes,&quot; stated Yuki sharply, holding her blade like a true 
empress. &quot;But not yours.&quot; All five girls attacked at once, but Yuki 
clearly got the most results. After all, when one uses the Bane of Evil 
against the very embodiment of evil itself, one does not expect anything 
less than results. Aku yelled out in pain and anger, but all the horrid 
emotions in the world could no longer save him. At last, at long last, 
Yuki and her friends&#151;the entire world&#151;was honored with the delight of 
witnessing the shogun of sorrow, the deliverer of darkness, the minister 
of malice (and so on), crumble and implode upon himself in a flash of 
light.

And that, as they say, is that.

But one more thing needed to be done.

......

There were no words that could express Yuki&#39;s infinite gratitude towards 
her friends. After resting up for the rest of the day, the five met up 
again for one last time, each of them embracing the other. They took 
special care of the heroic samurai, heaping her with love and quiet 
praises&#151;but they knew they had to say goodbye. After all, there was 
still a future that needed to be saved, and only one person could do it. 
Thankfully at least, there was one less obstacle in her way, and so with 
a last farewell, Yuki left behind her greatest friends, and perhaps for 
the last time, took her feet to the road in pursuit of a way back home.
