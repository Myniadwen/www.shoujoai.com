<h1>Chronicles of Azion: Lover's Chance (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ghosteternity.html">Ghost of Eternity</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/azion-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>	Jenna shifted her staff to her other hand and yawned. She hoped 
they&#39;d be stopping soon (her feet hurt and she was hungry). She looked 
over at Raven and couldn&#39;t help but smile. The beautiful girl beside her 
cut a handsome figure even in her traveling clothes (of course she could 
be wearing burlap and Jenna wouldn&#39;t care). As her eyes traced over her 
figure and fell upon her face, Jenna smiled as she remembered their 
first kiss.
	It had completely thrown her off guard; so much so that when Raven 
had asked her to come with her she had jumped at the chance. Yes, she 
was certainly in love.
	But even with all this they hadn&#39;t really talked about that 
afternoon. To be honest Jenna didn&#39;t really know what terms she and 
Raven were on: Friends? More than friends? Dare she say it... a couple?
	Her train of thought was interrupted when she noticed Raven had 
stopped a few feet behind her to peruse a map. Jenna turned and jogged 
back. &quot;Lost?&quot;
	Raven nodded. &quot;Yes. For the life of me I can&#39;t remember which way 
to go. If we&#39;re going to Leranon the sunset should be in front of us. 
But you see? It&#39;s behind us and I can&#39;t figure out where we got lost.&quot;
	Jenna&#39;s eyes widened as she suddenly processed what Raven had 
said. &quot;Leranon? The Elven city? We&#39;re going there??&quot;
	The other girl grinned at Jenna&#39;s excitement. &quot;We&#39;re going to 
visit my friends and my sister and brother in law.&quot;
	The novice snatched the map out of her hands and mumbled, &quot;Ok, 
which way do we go...?&quot;
	As she watched her, Raven took a moment to reflect on all that had 
happened. She certainly hadn&#39;t expected Jenna to actually come with her. 
Not that she minded of course, but still...
	She wasn&#39;t sure how she&#39;d fallen so quickly for the novice, but 
she undoubtedly was in love. But she wasn&#39;t certain if she could let 
herself feel that way. Ciege&#39;s rejection was still fresh in her mind, 
and she wasn&#39;t convinced she was ready to open her heart again. And what 
with her Power being as unstable as it was... what if she had another 
attack and Jenna got hurt? She hoped that would never happen.
	&quot;Aha!&quot; Jenna looked up at Raven, her brown eyes gleaming. &quot;You 
were holding the map upside down, silly! Look!&quot; she turned the map 
around and Raven saw that they had been going in the right direction. 
She blushed and Jenna giggled as she handed the map back to the elf.
	&quot;Well, uh... let&#39;s go then. The forest is just over this hill.&quot;
----------
(Flashback)
	Raven swallowed as she watched Ciege sitting on the balcony. His 
grey-blue eyes gazed at the night sky and she felt her knees grow weak. 
She took a deep breath and walked into the moonlight. &quot;Ciege?&quot;
	The Elven prince turned and smiled at her. &quot;Hello Raven. To what 
do I owe this honor?&quot; he stood up and strode toward her.
	Raven took an unsteady step back, and then forced herself forward 
knowing she had to say something. &quot;I...I wanted to speak to you.&quot;
	&quot;What about?&quot;
	The speech she&#39;d prepared flew out the window and she stood there, 
not knowing what she was going to say. After a few tense moments 
everything she&#39;d wanted to say for months tumbled out all at once.
	&quot;Ciege from the moment I saw you I knew that you were the one and 
when you stood up to the king and you saved me from his assassins I 
thought that maybe you cared for me too and you&#39;ve been there for me 
through this entire mess and I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that I 
love you. I love you.&quot; Raven finished and exhaled; a great weight 
finally off her shoulders.
      Ciege hadn&#39;t moved or said one thing during her whole tirade; just 
keeping his eyes fixed on her the entire time. His silence made her very 
nervous and she finally said timidly, &quot;Ciege?&quot;
      	He sighed and turned away. When he looked back, Raven saw 
his eyes and knew what he was going to say. In that moment her heart 
shattered.
      &quot;I&#39;m sorry Raven. I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t see you that way. Please 
understand that I hold you in the highest respect but...&quot; he sighed once 
again, and then cupped her face in his hands looking her square in the 
eyes. &quot;You deserve someone who can love you for who you truly are, who 
loves you no matter what.&quot;
      &quot;So that kiss,&quot; Raven whispered brokenly, &quot;at Tek&#39;s funeral. Was 
that... pity?&quot;
      &quot;Yes. I&#39;m so sorry Raven.&quot;
      Raven gently pulled away from him and sniffled. &quot;I understand. 
I&#39;ll go now.&quot; And before he said another word Raven bowed and fled down 
the corridor trying to muffle her sobs...
      ----------
      Jenna threw herself onto the soft bed and laughed. &quot;Wow! This 
place is amazing! And I haven&#39;t even seen the rest of the city yet!&quot;
      Raven chuckled as she watched Jenna stand up and go to the balcony 
to stare out at the glittering city before her. She put down their packs 
and leaned against the wall, smiling. Jenna looked about excitedly, the 
light from the torches enhancing her profile. Those beautiful eyes 
sparkled and Raven caught her breath as she suddenly remembered the last 
time she&#39;d been a on a balcony with someone she loved. This time, there 
won&#39;t be any tears, she decided. She felt like laughing, screaming and 
crying all at once. She knew now what she had to do and closed her eyes; 
letting her emotions go. When they opened they burned with a soft blue 
fire.
      Jenna suddenly felt eyes watching her, and she turned. The sight 
before her was beautiful. Raven leaned against the wall, her arms 
crossed and the shadows enhancing the contours of her face. Her eyes now 
glowed electric blue, though it was different that the attack in the 
inn. Suddenly Jenna felt a little afraid, clutching at the rail of the 
balcony for support.
      &quot;Don&#39;t be afraid.&quot; Raven&#39;s voice was low and sweet; it sang with a 
sensuality that made Jenna grip the railing even harder as she felt her 
knees weaken. She and the elf were now face-to-face and she ran a hand 
through Jenna&#39;s hair, removing her cap. &quot;I won&#39;t hurt you. 
Just...stay...perfectly...still.&quot; She leaned forward and slowly, gently, 
and tenderly kissed her.
      The novice gasped as she felt a rush of heat wash over her right 
down to her toes and back again. She wound her arms around Raven&#39;s neck 
and deepened the kiss; her head swimming with love and desire. Her heart 
began to pound against her ribs and she sensed that Raven&#39;s was too.
      Raven smiled and pulled Jenna closer. Just a little bit longer... 
then a moment later she pulled away, smiling. Jenna&#39;s eyes opened and 
she blinked a few times as if to collect her wits about her.
      *If that&#39;s what it&#39;s like every time we kiss, I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll 
ever be able to keep my hands off of you.*
      Jenna started. Raven had spoken to her, but her lips hadn&#39;t moved. 
&quot;Wait, how can you hear&#151;&quot;
      *You can read my thoughts now. It&#39;s called a bond. Tek, Belle and 
I shared one, and so does Belle and her husband.* Raven replied, 
blushing.
      Suddenly the nature of the bond dawned on Jenna, and she looked 
incredulously at the other girl. &quot;You mean...&quot;
      &quot;Yes. I... was afraid to say it but... I love you Jenna.&quot; Raven 
whispered. &quot;I never want to leave your side.&quot; 
      Jenna laid her head on Raven&#39;s shoulder as she fought the tears of 
joy in her voice. &quot;Do you mean it? Because the feeling is definitely 
mutual.&quot;
      &quot;Of course I do,&quot; Raven murmured into the other girl&#39;s hair, &quot;I 
love you. And I promise I&#39;ll never leave you.&quot;
      The two held each other, each listening to the other&#39;s breathing 
as the stars and torches twinkled. In that moment Raven swore with every 
bone in her body that she would always be with Jenna...
      No matter what happened.
