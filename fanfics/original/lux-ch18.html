<B><P>Episode XVIII:  Hearts in Ice</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Was greed ever satisfied?  Was selfishness ever sated?  Did any human truly know when to quit while they were ahead?  The task of granting the “humble” wish of Ezra Price had finally been completed--with her unnatural powers of granting wishes, the creature known as the Ice Djinn had fulfilled the task given to her by the man who freed her from her crystal prison.  And with that completion, the second half of her ultimate destiny would soon be fulfilled, and she would return to the chilly climes to be imprisoned once again, waiting for the next starving, selfish savior to release her once again for their own means.</P>
<P>&#9;Had Aisuna the heart, she would have wept bitterly over her never-ending fate, but the ability to shed tears, or even know what feelings were at all, had been lost eons ago in the cold of eternal winter.  Now she was an apathetic, stoic, empty shell, a creature who no longer bothered to care about anything, whether it be the fate of the world or who loved her, or even if she would die.  She would welcome death, even fire if necessary, to escape her damning existence, but it seemed as if the powers that controlled the universe took perverse pleasure in punishing her eternally, keeping her a slave in the form of a goddess.</P>
<P>&#9;And so, once her task was complete, Aisuna left Price Empires as quietly as she had entered into it, ascending to the rooftop so she could fly away unnoticed.  However, one man followed her, a man so tenacious and smitten with her that he had never been away from her sight, even when she offered the world no sight to begin with.  He was a crazed fellow, completely obsessed with Aisuna and literally stumbling over her at times.  The people of that world and many other worlds in the galaxy knew him as the Informer, but only a tiny minority knew him by his true name, Glavius.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;“My dear!  Surely you will not leave me behind!”  Aisuna frowned and did not bother to turn around.  She knew who was coming, and why he was chasing her even now, but she wanted nothing to do with him.  She had been “loved” before by many people, men and women alike, and they had all promised her their hearts and souls and dedication, and always failed in the end.  Death claimed some, the frozen lands she was trapped in took others, and weariness, boredom, and inconsistency claimed the rest.  This Glavius would be no different from them.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>It is not my concern whether or not you follow me, creature,</I>” she whispered in her otherworldly voice.  “<I>If you find that you must follow me or else perish, that is your concern only.  I have nothing but to return to the northern lands, and to my prison of ice.  Do as you wish.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“I only wish to accompany you, my lady,” he replied warmly.  “Please, permit me to stay at your side.  You have been my entire life, Aisuna, and--”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I have heard your declarations before, creature,</I>” she interrupted swiftly.  “<I>They begin to tire me.  I doubt their strength.  If you wish to accompany me, you may do so, but you will die in the end.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“Hopefully, not by your hands,” he muttered playfully.  Aisuna barely even blinked, keeping her face as hard and cold as a glacier.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>No… not unless somebody wished for your death.  I will be leaving you now, creature.</I>”  And just like that, Aisuna took to the skies, leaving the Informer behind to watch her trail.  Of course, he was not one to just stand there and watch his life’s obsession fly away from him.  Quickly, he summoned his secret bird familiar, a very large owl that he mounted whenever he needed to travel great distances in a short time.  He quickly caught up with Aisuna, who did not seem to be in any hurry to arrive at her destination.</P>
<P>&#9;“Hello there!” he shouted happily as he caught up with her.  Aisuna looked over at him for only a second, completely uninterested.  She would normally give him credit for being so persistent, but many more potential lovers had overcome similar obstacles, and their bones had been turned into dust ages ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;After a few minutes of flying side-by-side in silence, Glavius decided to strike up a conversation with the Ice Djinn.  In all the weeks that he had watched over her and protected her from being used by the wrong people, he had tried speaking to her many times before, but rarely got any response.  Aisuna never smiled and barely even noticed that he was there at all.  He figured that twenty-four millenniums worth of life would jade anybody into such a careless automaton, but he really didn’t ask for much more than a friendly response, just one.</P>
<P>&#9;“Well, since we’ll be traveling together, why don’t we get to know each other?  I’m afraid that I’ve already told you about myself, but what about you, my dear?  What sort of things do you like?”</P>

<P>Sadly, she only gave him silence.</P>

<P>&#9;“My dear Aisuna, I am only trying to make our moments together more wholesome,” he smiled, adjusting his thick glasses.  “Believe me when I tell you that my attraction towards you is far beyond the physical level.  Your beauty ensnares me only so much; it is the rest of you, your sheer mystique, that spurns my heart and my wonder.  What sort of woman comes across the powers of granting wishes?!  I wish to know everything about you, Aisuna, even though I know more about you than any other creature in this life.”</P>

<P>Again, silence.</P>

<P>&#9;“You break my heart, beautiful Aisuna,” he sighed sadly.  “I wish only to love you.  Ever since I was old enough to read, I have dreamt of meeting you, the legendary Ice Djinn, a woman who grants wishes, lives eternally, and has, no doubt, an infinite well of passion bubbling inside of her soul.”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I have lost all meaning of love and compassion ages ago,</I>” she said suddenly, at long last.  Glavius’ face lit up in a broad smile.</P>
<P>&#9;“Ahh, thank you for speaking back!  That one sentence truly made these past five minutes worth it, though I disbelieve what you say!  Well now, I <I>know</I> you <I>want</I> to use that cistern of love--”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I told you, mortal, I have no more love within me.  It was lost, long ago, in the depths of the pure crystal blanket that is my prison.  Speak no more of it.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“Only on one condition,” he replied.  Her bluish-black eyes darted towards him.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I make no conditions, mortal.  Grant my request.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“Only if you call me by my name, dearest Aisuna!”  Glavius chuckled as if he had told a joke that only he understood, adjusting his glasses so they wouldn’t fall off in the breeze.  Aisuna stared at him for a very long time, a small trace of irritation and anger behind the face of snow.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I do not need to honor any requests…  But if you are going to be persistent about it, then I shall call you Glavius out of courtesy.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“Thank you, my precious,” he sighed happily, bowing humbly as if a great weight had finally been freed from his shoulders.  “Thank you, dear goddess, for calling me Glavius.  That one act alone has filled my heart with joy.”  Aisuna kept her silence, as usual, and continued to fly forward.  Glavius didn’t care, though.  He was living out his dreams, all of them, and it didn’t matter that she was being quiet or unresponsive.  His love for her ran too deep to be bothered by such things.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Since Aisuna was not a full-blooded goddess, she was forced to set down upon the surface of the earth and rest her weary body.  Glavius’ owl was mighty and strong, but it too needed its rest, and so they both flapped down onto a small, temperate island somewhere in the upper regions of the world, though nowhere near the icy climate that Aisuna was used to.  Glavius left his owl to hunt on its own as he followed the stunning lady around the island.  She preferred no company at all, but since he insisted on coming along, she allowed him to stay.</P>
<P>&#9;Aisuna walked off alone, putting a temporary distance between herself and Glavius, but the wise man did not stray too far before catching up to her.  He came across her standing on the very edge of a cape, at least a kilometer above the surface of the crashing waves.  There was a hypnotic beauty about her, about the porcelain-pale skin of hers that had traces of blue around it, a muscular body that never strayed from its feminine roots, a pair of wings that had sprouted out so she could fly, and a face that wore a million expressions without ever needing to change once.</P>
<P>&#9;There was no telling what she thought of during that time.  Maybe it was about whoever her new master would be, and what sort of greedy possession they would ask of her.  Maybe it was a long-lost lover, who perished and turned into dust, rendering her heart stony.  Perhaps it was her own fate, granted with power and life yet doomed to be a slave to others, fulfilling their own wishes instead of her own.  Perhaps she wished that somebody would care about <I>her</I> for once, instead of their own selves.</P>
<P>&#9;“Beautiful,” said Glavius quietly as he made his presence known to the demi-goddess.  Aisuna turned around to see him smiling at her.  “Of course, I’m not just referring to you.  This view is very magnificent, don’t you agree?”  As usual, Aisuna did not answer him at first, but she decided to at least feign politeness for the time, and turned around to admire the scenery.  The Informer was right, of course.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>…Yes, actually.  I… never get the chance to really admire something so simple as a view of the ocean, nor of the sky or the sun.  But this will not last.  Once I am rested, I shall return to my prison, and you will most likely die of frost.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“I wouldn’t underestimate my durability,” he chuckled as he lowered his face, though not in an act of humility.  “I can endure more than you might not think.  And if I am not mistaken, there are people who will want to use your powers again, very soon.  I’ll gamble that neither one of us will remain in the north for long.”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I hope you <U>are</U> mistaken, Glavius,</I>” she sighed sadly, and for the first time in a very long while, she displayed a trace of emotion.  “<I>I would rather be trapped forever than in the confines of a greedy person.  I detest that, though I have no say in it.  It is as simple as myself being freed by a person strong enough, or clever enough, to journey to the north and release me.  When that happens, I have no choice but to grant their wishes.  It is that simple.</I>”  Amazed at just how much she was opening up to him, Glavius slowly walked towards her, giving her a sad smile as he admired her rugged beauty.</P>
<P>&#9;“I understand that much.  It really is a pity, Aisuna.  I suppose that only death can free you?”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>Yes… but who would kill an Ice Djinn?  If I am to believe anything you say, you would never inflict harm upon me, not even to put me out of my misery.  There are far too many selfish people in this world for any of them to kill me, and besides, I am a demi-goddess.  Do you think there exists a person with the <U>strength</U> to destroy me?</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“I’m sure they’re somewhere around this world,” he muttered, waving his hand lazily.  “But lady Aisuna, I assure you that I am neither greedy nor selfish, unless you consider wanting to be in your presence a selfish act.  You are literally my entire life personified into a sentient creature, Aisuna.  Why would I ask for anything more than you yourself?”  Aisuna actually let out a chuckle, and a very depressed smile, and shook her head at the foolish, wise man.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>Glavius…  That is one wish that I will never be able to grant.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“Darn.  So much for my plans for this evening.  Ha!”  She hummed out softly and returned his smile, though she did not know why.  For some strange reason, Aisuna felt as if she could truly believe this eccentric but gentle man when he spoke of his desires.  He honestly wanted nothing but her, and would give up everything else--literally everything, even his own life--all for her sake.  She sensed his honesty and his pure intentions, though she was still doubtful.  This man had proven himself so far, but how would he fare on the rest of the journey?</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I am sorry.  I cannot love a mortal.  There is a line that separates you and I, Glavius, a line of age and agelessness that cannot be crossed.  Your life, no matter how long it may be, will be like a flash of light to me.  Even if I returned your love a thousand times over, you would still die and I would still be alone.  The more I loved you, the more I would lose upon your death.  It is that simple.</I>”</P>

<P>Now, it was his turn to say nothing.</P>

<P>&#9;Glavius had not expected Aisuna to sound so grieving and mournful.  It was obvious that she had once loved as he had, a fiery flaming passion that ignored the gaping boundary of mortality and immortality, and though that love had shaken the heavens and defied the stars themselves, it ended in death for one and everlasting, painful life for the other.  Glavius <I>knew</I> that Aisuna was really capable of love; the fact of the matter was that she did not <I>want</I> to be capable of it, for fear of falling so far from such a high plateau.</P>
<P>&#9;“My dear woman…”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I have stayed here too long,</I>” she stated flatly, her voice regaining its strength.  “<I>I must leave at once.  Glavius, will you follow me even though you know what will happen?  I cannot avoid my destiny, but you may.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“It doesn’t matter,” he shrugged.  “I have spent my entire life for the simple purpose of discovering you and being at your side for as long as I can.  There <I>is</I> no other destiny for me.  Even if it is for a short time, I would like to be near you, at least to protect you from those who would take advantage of your power.  Consider me your companion for life, my dear.”  She let out a sigh, knowing that not even she could dissuade him and his ideals, so with a reluctant heart, she allowed him to continue following close by.</P>
<P>&#9;The happiness he expressed was almost enough to warm even her heart.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">----------</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Slowly, Glavius felt the chill of the northern world gnaw at his flesh and clothes as he and Aisuna flew closer and closer to her icy home.  He was oftentimes forced to shield himself from a bitter storm that stabbed at him, and snowflakes that fell into his hair were more like razors.  The world was growing colder and colder, and the distance longer and longer towards her frozen palace of crystal, but Glavius endured, because he saw that Aisuna was enduring as well.  She had looked weak and even vulnerable in the warm office building and the temperate island, but now that the cold was surrounding her once again, she began to resemble the goddess that Glavius had been yearning for all his life.</P>
<P>&#9;It only took a single look back to warm his heart, though.  Once, when he felt that he would fall into the merciless cold ocean below, he let out a little squeak and clutched tighter to his owl.  Aisuna glanced back at him, probably startled by the sudden shout, but her gaze lasted for more than a brief moment.  Her bluish-black eyes laid on him for a bit longer, almost as if she were making sure that he was okay.  If Glavius had more of an imagination and wasn’t so concerned with clinging onto his familiar, he would’ve thought that she was actually <I>concerned</I> about him.</P>
<P>&#9;The journey was endless, but so was his dedication.  Aisuna finally gave him the credit he deserved, because any ordinary man would have given up or died by that point.  Glavius certainly was a lot tougher than he looked, and absolutely adamant about his word.  He surprised Aisuna by sticking to such a promise, and even when the threat of cold and ice and death hugged him constantly, he kept his smile and watched Aisuna always, admiring her beauty and strength.  She had to give him credit, but reminded herself not to love him.  It would just end in tragedy, anyway.  She did allow him to be near her, though, which seemed sufficient for the eccentric Informer.</P>
<P>&#9;Finally, after several frosty days and nights of flying, Glavius’ loyal owl familiar gave way and collapsed into a dead heap.  By that time, though, the Informer had already sensed that something was amiss, and guided his owl down to the surface, onto the very edge of the northern world.  It was there where his owl finally froze to death, and so they both took a brief moment to rest and pay their respects.  Aisuna seemed content to just watch as Glavius carefully buried his longtime companion in the snow.  Such love for a creature like that had to be admired; not just any man would go through that trouble, especially in such inclement weather.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>Glavius…</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“This was the best thing that could have happened to him,” said the Informer, speaking easily above the calm drift of snow.  “If he did not die from the weather, he would have died from a broken heart, for I would never see him again if I chose to follow you.  This loyal companion knew this all along, and decided that he would help me completely fulfill my lifelong wish, going so far as to sacrifice his own brilliant life so that I may follow you to this land.  I am not worthy of being his companion; I could never be so great, so great as this simple, humble, noble owl.  I will miss him as dearly as if he were my own brother.”</P>
<P>&#9;He kept silent after that, for a very long time, and Aisuna knew that only she would be able to console him.  Several ghosts of frozen breath came out of his mouth and nose as he stood there, seemingly unaffected by the cold, standing and staring and quietly lamenting his recent loss.  Aisuna, her crystal heart melted just slightly from his poetic eulogy, actually took a step forward and placed her hand on his shoulder.  It was warm, even in the snow, but it was a warmth she liked.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>We should move on, Glavius.  My--<U>our</U> destiny awaits.</I>”  He quietly nodded his head, the significance of what she had just said lost on him as he thought of his perished companion.  It was still a long way away from the true north polarity of the world, and even though Aisuna claimed to have no love in her stony heart, she was not so cruel as to force Glavius to trudge through the snow on foot, even though he started out by doing this.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>Here, I will carry you so you will not need to walk the rest of the way.</I>”  She picked him up, putting one arm underneath his legs and another beneath his back, and lifted him up off the ground.  Glavius gave her a warm smile as she carried him into the sky, and reveled in the simplicity of her cool touch and the close proximity of her face.  He had never been so touched by the woman before, nor had he ever been that close, so it was a blissful experience for him.  He even noticed Aisuna looking down at him from time to time--usually by reflex, but at times, she returned his smile faintly.</P>
<P>&#9;He was so entranced with her that he didn’t even notice the cold, nor the distance traveled.  In no time at all, she descended and placed him on the ground, near a cave.  She puffed out a deep and weary breath as the burden was lightened; Glavius began shivering terribly.  He had boasted of how resilient he was to the cold, but now that he was actually surrounded by it, his claims were not so valid.</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>Enter,</I>” said Aisuna, pointing to the mouth of the cave.  He did, and found a small hot springs hidden inside, just large enough for three people.  The insides of the cave warmed him up a bit, and he slowly stopped shivering.</P>
<P>&#9;“Ah, I didn’t know there were any hot springs up here!” he exclaimed.  Aisuna quietly nodded her head, and wandered over to dip her feet inside the water.  She winced slightly as the heat overwhelmed her, but Glavius seemed to feel right at home as he soaked his own feet.  Aisuna gave him a simple smile, not a particularly happy one but not one of sadness either, and began removing her sparse clothes like it was nothing.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Needless to say, Glavius was given a rare treat that day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;“Oh my,” he whispered, chuckling softly as he stared at the demi-goddess’ naked body.  The truly interesting part was not her nakedness, though, but the fact that she wasn’t shamed in the least.  Aisuna gradually descended into the hot water, grimacing in pain as it washed over her, and with a struggle, she invited her companion in.  He stiffly smiled, and shed all his clothes off as well.  She didn’t seem particularly surprised or ashamed as he did; she just allowed him to sink in.</P>
<P>&#9;“…This is heaven,” he moaned softly as he sprawled his arms over the side.  “I could be in here for days.  I hardly ever experience this kind of luxury anymore.”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>I discovered this right before my last hibernation,</I>” she told him, her voice somewhat pleasant and friendly, versus the harsh and cold sound it usually made.  “<I>I detested it because of the heat, but I always kept it in mind should I decide to save somebody from freezing.  You should be grateful, Glavius, for I could have left you to die.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“I <I>am</I> grateful, my beauty,” he sang quietly.  “Eternally and infinitely.  I was right; you <I>do</I> care about me.”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>Perhaps,</I>” she replied emptily.  “<I>At any rate, I will allow you to live here.  You will find food very hard to find, but if you are honest about being at my side, then I will welcome you here.  Perhaps… Glavius… my destiny can wait for a few moments more.</I>”</P>
<P>&#9;“I hope so,” he replied warmly.  “There is much that this Informer does not know about you.”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>Perhaps I should teach you, then…</I>”  Aisuna gave him another smile, and reclined back into the pool, recalling the pieces of her life she was most comfortable telling others about.  She left out sections, of course, but Glavius nevertheless seemed absorbed in her.  They talked long and late, so late that they were forced to rise out of the pool or else turn into raisins, and yet had barely scratched the surface of the Ice Djinn’s past and personals.  She did not need to sleep, and though he vowed to stay awake for as long as necessary, he ended up drifting away into slumber in several hours.</P>
<P>&#9;Wanting to be present when he woke up, Aisuna rested his head in her lap, and watched him sleep the whole night through.</P>
