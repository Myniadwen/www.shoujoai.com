<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/throughdeath-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>      &quot;Love is permeating throughout this house! I can feel it!&quot; Erin loved Faye to death, 
but sometimes... her lover was a bit eccentric. Faye was smiling like a goofball, adjusting 
the baseball cap on her head. &quot;I think Abby and the Living Inferno are k-i-s-s-i-n-g!&quot; Erin 
laughed a bit. Even if Abby was going to die, at least she found someone to spend her last 
moments with.

      &quot;That&#39;s good, but do you think we should leave?&quot; Erin asked, only to find herself 
pulled onto the couch by Faye. &quot;Nah... don&#39;t you want to see what he looks like?&quot; The snake 
goddess shrugged, now sitting comfortably on Faye&#39;s lap. The red head grinned. &quot;Seeing other 
people in love makes me wanna whisk you away somewhere...&quot; Erin giggled as Faye started to 
nip at her neck.

      They kissed, but pulled away when they heard someone. They looked over the couch into 
the kitchen, where Abby had just walked into. She opened a cupboard and got a glass out. 
Erin had to stifle a laugh, seeing how Abby was only wearing a t-shirt and panties. The 
young mother turned and saw them, almost cropping the glass out of shock.

      &quot;Jesus-! Can a woman not walk around half naked in her own home anymore?!&quot; Abby asked, 
looking a bit miffed. &quot;Sorry Abby, we just came to check up on you,&quot; Erin said, watching as 
the blonde woman filled the glass with water. Both goddesses got up and walked over to her. 
&quot;You know... at this rate, you can go clubbing with us sometime!&quot; Faye said, laughing. Abby 
still looked 23, much to her dismay.

      &quot;Yeah, yeah. Just wait - you&#39;re going to be changing my diapers tomorrow if this keeps 
up.&quot; She began to drink the water, but started to notice the devious look on Faye&#39;s face. 
&quot;Alright, what is it, Miss Goddess of Love?&quot; It was Erin who answered. &quot;Oh, we&#39;re just 
curious as to what the Living Inferno looks like.&quot;

      Abby spurted the water out in surprise and stared at them. &quot;What? How did you... did 
Eveon tell you?&quot; Faye shook her head laughing. &quot;Nope! It just so happens that I, being the 
goddess that I am, have the ability to know a person&#39;s love. Yours happens to be the Living 
Inferno and I know you two must have... you know.&quot; Faye was grinning like the Cheshire cat 
while Erin started peering up the stairs. &quot;Yeah, where is he Abby? We just want to say 
congrats.&quot;

      &quot;He... he&#39;s sleeping!&quot; Abby said hurriedly, trying to think of an excuse. She loved 
Sakura to death, but... she was never going to live down the lesbian jokes. Abby had to 
wonder if this was karma. Faye was giving her a strange look. &quot;Abby... the Living Inferno&#39;s 
real name is Sakura?&quot;

      The blonde mother&#39;s eye started to twitch. &quot;How do you know that Faye?&quot; The love 
goddess shrugged. &quot;Hey, I can also see their name too so... You can&#39;t hide true love from 
me!&quot; Faye said triumphantly and her enthusiasm was starting to give Abby a headache.

      &quot;Hey... isn&#39;t Sakura a girl&#39;s name...?&quot; Erin murmured absent mindedly. Faye and her 
exchanged looks. Then, they both looked over at Abby who was now red in the face. There was 
a moment of silence before both goddesses said, &quot;No way!&quot;

      Abby could have bashed her head into the counter. Why couldn&#39;t they have come later 
when she was ready to introduce Sakura? Her thoughts were interrupted as all three heard 
someone come down the stairs. &quot;...Abby? Are you okay?&quot;

      Faye and Erin turned at the sound of the lilting voice. Sakura gave them a nod of 
acknowledgement, completely forgetting that she wasn&#39;t wearing her armor. The two goddesses 
exchanged looks again. &quot;...You... you&#39;re a girl?&quot; Erin asked and watched as Sakura turned 
bright red upon realizing why they were staring.

      &quot;...yes...&quot; Sakura murmured, going over to where Abby was. The blonde mother held her 
hand and said, &quot;Alright, this is Sakura and yes, we&#39;re in love and yes, she is the Living 
Inferno.&quot; Erin smiled. &quot;I&#39;m so happy for you two... but it&#39;s kind of weird. We&#39;ve known 
Sakura for a while now, but it feels like we&#39;re just meeting her.&quot;

      Faye adjusted her baseball cap, thinking hard. &quot;Wait... if you&#39;re the Living 
Inferno... what happened to your raspy voice?&quot; Sakura tilted her head in confusion, while 
Erin and Abby realized what she meant. &quot;That&#39;s right. After you took off your armor, your 
voice changed...&quot; Abby murmured. Sakura nodded and started going back up the stairs.

      They all watched her silently. Faye turned to Abby smiling deviously. &quot;Soooo... I 
never took you for a lesbian, but it goes to show that love comes in all forms!&quot; Erin gave 
Faye a slight pinch. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t tease her. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s hard for her... Abby, it must be 
strange, seeing as you had Terry and now...&quot;

      Abby shrugged. &quot;Yeah, but like Faye said, it&#39;s love. But it was awkward still... I 
don&#39;t know, once you love someone it&#39;s easier to look past that stuff.&quot; Faye suddenly leaned 
closer and said, &quot;Do you need some tips? You can&#39;t teach an old dog new tricks, they say, 
but in your case, I&#39;m sure we can help out.&quot; Abby gave her a dead panned look. &quot;Oh really? 
Lesbian love advice?&quot;

      There was a moment of silence. &quot;...alright...&quot; Abby said with a sigh, absent mindedly 
ruffling her hair. &quot;Okay, first off, you can&#39;t do the same things you did with your husband 
with her,&quot; Faye said. Erin blushed at her unabashed girlfriend, not actually believing she 
was doing this. &quot;Wow, I never knew that,&quot; Abby said rolling her eyes.

      &quot;Second, who&#39;s more dominant?&quot; Abby just stared at her, slightly flustered. &quot;I... I 
don&#39;t know! We only did it once. I mean, she&#39;s a bit more pushy, but-&quot; Faye interrupted her. 
&quot;Alright, Sakura&#39;s dominant,&quot; Abby made a face at that, but said nothing. &quot;Third, how much 
experience do you guys have?&quot; The blonde mother was a bit nervous about answering for 
Sakura.

      &quot;Well, I had Terry for a good six years, but Sakura... I think her only time before 
me, she... was raped,&quot; Both Erin and Faye grimaced at this. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s horrible,&quot; the snake 
goddess murmured, but her girlfriend continued in her crash course of lesbian love. &quot;If 
that&#39;s the case, she must like it real gentle. What you have to understand, Abby, is that 
while there may be a more dominant partner, a homosexual relationship doesn&#39;t have to be 
constrained to such parameters.&quot;

      Abby took a sip of her water, her expression denoting confusion. &quot;What I mean, is that 
anything in the relationship is more about mutual understanding and equality. When you two 
make love, be sure to pay attention to what she likes and exploit. Sakura seems like she 
loves cuddle time so that should be your starting point.&quot;

      The young mother sighed. &quot;I could have figured that out myself, but thank you, Faye.&quot; 
The love goddess and said, &quot;Oh, were you asking for different positions or something? I know 
Erin likes it really rough, but I&#39;d be willing to share some of the strategies I use-&quot;

      Thankfully for Erin and Abby, Sakura had finally come back downstairs. The angel was 
holding all the pieces of her damaged armor, along with the cloak. She dropped it in a messy 
pile before finding the armor mouthpiece. &quot;This piece,&quot; she said, before delicately putting 
it on, &quot;changes my voice.&quot; True to her words, her feminine voice changed to a raspy one upon 
donning the armor.

      After removing it again, Sakura noticed the strange expression on everyone&#39;s faces. 
&quot;Did I miss something?&quot; She asked, walking over to Abby. They said nothing. Erin was hiding 
her face in her hand, Faye was smiling sheepishly and Abby was looking away, blushing. The 
angel walked over to her lover, delicately grabbing the blonde&#39;s face.

      They made direct eye contact and Abby felt a shiver go down her spine as those red 
eyes pierced through her own. Then she realized that Sakura was trying to find the answer to 
her question. Crap. It was obvious when she found it, for Sakura turned bright red and 
grabbed her warm cheeks out of embarrassment. Faye and Erin exchanged glances. &quot;You know,&quot; 
Erin murmured and Faye finished her sentence. &quot;I think we have some business to go attend 
to!&quot;

      The two goddesses started out the door, Faye giving Abby a suggestive thumbs up, while 
Erin gave her an apologetic expression. The blonde mother watched them leave and realized 
she was going to have a helluva couple of days. Her attention soon turned to Sakura when the 
white haired woman grasped her hand and began to suckle on her fingertips.

      &quot;I... I do like to be cuddled...&quot; Sakura murmured. Abby could have died of 
embarrassment if her lover didn&#39;t start dragging her back upstairs. 

***** 

      &quot;I am in the middle of dominating my beautiful, wonderful exorcist and you say this is 
important?!&quot; Faye held the phone a few inches away from her ear as Isaka started to rant. 
When it seemed the demon ran out of words to complain with, the goddess began to speak. 
&quot;Look, I just thought you would like to know that the Living Inferno and Abby are together, 
but... the Living Inferno is a girl.&quot;

      There was silence on the other end. Faye guessed it was sinking in... &quot;What?! But 
isn&#39;t Abby... I didn&#39;t think Abby was... you know... man, my gaydar totally failed me.&quot; Faye 
giggled. &quot;Yeah, Erin and I were going to head over later this evening. You and Krystal going 
to do the same?&quot; The demon let out a sigh. &quot;Yes, yes, yes...&quot; Faye looked over at her 
bathroom, seeing Erin come out. &quot;Faye... do I really have to wear this...?&quot; Erin asked 
shyly, feeling awkward in the lingerie her girlfriend picked out.

      Faye just nodded and hurriedly said over the phone. &quot;Sorry Isaka, I gotta go. Erin&#39;s 
all dressed up and... see ya tonight!&quot; The demon flinched as Faye hung up. Isaka grumbled to 
herself before setting the phone down. &quot;What did Faye call for?&quot;

      Isaka turned at the voice to see her lover lounging on the bed. Her and Krystal had 
been getting down to business when the phone rang, startling them and resulting in Isaka 
falling off the bed. &quot;Oh, I&#39;ll tell you later,&quot; the demon murmured, sliding back onto the 
bed. &quot;So... where were we?&quot;

      Krystal giggled and pulled her closer. &quot;Well, according to you, you were the middle of 
dominating me.&quot; Isaka nuzzled into her neck happily. &quot;You got that right. We have a few 
hours until we should head over to Abby&#39;s...&quot; She grinned deviously. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t have 
anything planned, my sweet little exorcist.&quot;

      Krystal just sighed. &quot;Isaka, you&#39;re taking this role playing thing a little too 
seriously... I mean, I understand you wanting me to wear my exorcist outfit and you wanting 
to be dominant for this, but...&quot; Isaka pouted. &quot;B-b-b-but! Ever since I found out you were a 
girl, do you know how long I wanted to do this? To be the demon that taints and corrupts the 
innocent little exorcist?&quot;

      The blonde girl gave her a quick kiss. &quot;Okay, my sultry little demon. Please don&#39;t 
hurt me...!&quot; Krystal said in a mock fear voice. &quot;...Oh, trust me, I&#39;m not going to hurt you 
at all, my dear exorcist...&quot; Krystal would have giggled some more at Isaka&#39;s performance if 
she wasn&#39;t swiftly cut off with a kiss.
