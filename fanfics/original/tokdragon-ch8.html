Asagawa Training Facility, Tokyo, Japan 

Yoko strained the wet towel in her hands, over the bowl. It dripped 
slowly, while the material twisted in Yoko&#146;s hands. For the most part, 
it couldn&#146;t be too damp. She took it from the bowl to the forehead of 
Xiangau, who slept upon one of the spare bed chambers of the Asagawa 
Training Hall. His fever was higher than ever. But at least his sleep 
was not as restless as before. When Xiangau had been taken to the 
medical bay in Kakuri Isle, they could barely keep him from shivering. 
Even in that tropical climate, his limbs shook, as though he had been 
caught in the middle of some huge freezing snowstorm. That was two days 
ago. When the whole group of fighters had been sent back to Japan, Yoko 
immediately took Xiangau home with her. 

It was strange The two of them had been fighting so hard against each 
other in the finals of the God of Fighting Grand Championships. Yoko 
still had the bruises to prove it. There really needed to be no caring 
between the two of them. And although Xiangau&#146;s current condition was 
not her making, Yoko felt responsible for him. In truth, she respected 
him. She valued who and what he was. And she felt that there was so much 
to be learned from him. And so much for Xiangau to learn from the 
Asagawa Training Facility. Maybe it was forward thinking of her to 
assume that Xiangau would even want to stay here for a while, but Yoko 
did plan on asking him when he awoke. 

The brunette took her hand to his mane of silver, soft hair, and smiled. 
She actually liked Xiangau.  He was so different from the men Yoko had 
met in her life. He was dedicated to fighting, proving to be something 
that he himself could be satisfied with. Yoko could tell that Xiangau 
had forsaken a lot in his life to get to his current level It was 
probably why he was so isolated. A man like that must have felt no need 
for friends. Which was one of the reasons that Yoko was doubtful that he 
would stay here with her and the other students. 

&#147;Wow. You&#146;ve hardly left his side.&#148;

Yoko looked back at the doorway to see who that was. &#147;Jun?&#148;

&#147;&#133;Don&#146;t get attached to him, Yoko.&#148; Jun said quietly. &#147;A guy like 
that&#146;ll ship out as soon as he&#146;s up and running. He just seems too much 
of a&#133; loner to want us as friends.&#148; 

Yoko shook her head. &#147;That doesn&#146;t mean I can&#146;t take care of him until 
he gets better. I can&#146;t just let him suffer. Not when I can do something 
about it. Think, Jun. You and I haven&#146;t known each other that long. That 
doesn&#146;t change the fact that you&#146;re my friend. And I wouldn&#146;t let that 
stand in the way of helping you in this situation.&#148;

&#147;I suppose,&#148; Jun said, her arms crossing. &#147;But he&#146;s a different person 
than me, Yoko. He barely said three words to us on Kakuri Island. All 
I&#146;m saying is, just don&#146;t expect him to be supremely grateful for all 
that you&#146;re doing for him.&#148;

Yoko nodded, smiling. Jun was just looking out for her. &#147;Thanks, Jun. 
Where are Li Ming and grandfather? Are they in the main hall?&#148;

&#147;Li Ming&#146;s catching up with all the folks here.&#148; Jun replied. &#147;I think 
they all really missed her. I knew the two of you knew each other 
before. Inside this cute little package is a cute big brain, right?&#148;

Yoko giggled lightly. &#147;I suppose so!&#148;

&#147;Well, I&#146;ll ignore that for now. But Nobuo is in the main hall, and he 
does want to you to come there. I think he wants to review what happened 
on Kakuri Island.&#148;

&#147;To be honest, I&#146;m not all that sure myself. I know there was more to 
that tournament than just a little bit of fighting. Just tell my 
grandfather that I&#146;ll come see him in a minute, okay? I&#146;ll be there 
after I take care of the last of Xiangau&#146;s cuts.&#148;

Jun shrugged &#147;Okay.&#148;

As Jun exited, Yoko turned back to Xiangau. She spread the bangs from 
his forehead, so they wouldn&#146;t be dampened by the cloth. Which was when 
she noticed the plaster on his cheek. It was becoming red. The girl 
carefully pulled it from his face, then tossed it to the garbage bin by 
the other side of the bed. His wounds were taking their time in healing. 

&#145;I have to buy some new dressings for him.&#146; Yoko thought. &#145;That means 
I&#146;ll have to go out to the market&#133;&#146;

It would delay meeting with Nobuo at the great hall, but he would 
understand, right? Xiangau&#146;s welfare came first. Yoko readjusted the wet 
cloth at his forehead, then stood upright, grabbed her wallet from her 
bedside cabinet, then made a paced dash for the door.

Kashrus Underground Base, Sea of Japan 

Reinhalt sighed as the doctors continued their meaningless study and 
watch over the Stone Egg. The item remained inside the small glass 
cylinder in the centre of the laboratory For the most part, everything 
had gone to plan. The Stone Egg was revived, and beating like the heart 
of an animal. The tournament was successful, and this all made life much 
easier for Reinhalt. Once these tests had been completed, and the Stone 
Egg was primed for departure to China, his finances would get a bonus 
the likes of which this world had never seen. Soon, soon.

&#147;How much longer?&#148; Reinhalt asked, &#147;Until the tests are complete?&#148;

The scientist at Reinhalt&#146;s side was before a computer. Every few 
seconds he tapped new codes or information into it, while his eyes 
looked through the glass cylinder towards the Stone Egg. 

He responded to his leader, saying,  &#147;It will take at least two weeks to 
fully understand what we have in our hands. This item is unlike anything 
I have ever seen. From the analysis we have conducted, the outer shell 
is made up of nothing more than 89% stone, 2.3% Sulphur and 3.7% 
limestone.&#148;

&#147;What about the remaining 5%?&#148; Reinhalt questioned

&#147;That, we do not know. It completely goes beyond anything we have ever 
known. All we know is that material is carbon based. Aside from that&#133; we 
know nothing. But that is the least of the mystery. The Stone Egg exudes 
a mild radiation. It is harmless, but the long term effects&#133; we cannot 
tell. The waves of this radiation come not from the shell, but the 
innards of the Egg. Something is inside of it&#133; but what?&#148;

Reinhalt&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;It&#146;s your duty to find out is inside of it.&#148;

&#147;You are not suggesting that we&#133; open it?&#148; The scientist yelled. 

&#147;Why not?&#148; Reinhalt retorted. 

&#147;Because the radiation inside it might have been worn down by the shell 
of the Egg. That means that the inside could be a great deal more 
dangerous than the outside. I suggest that we extract some of its 
innards via microscopic probes The less we withdraw, the more chance we 
have at completing this, which is the better option for all of us.&#148;

Reinhalt scowled. His plans weren&#146;t going exactly as wanted, but 
precautions were necessary. If anything, the manpower used for analysing 
the Stone Egg could be reflected into his pay out. When he handed it 
over to &#145;that man&#146; &#133;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Yoi shakai Marketplace, Tokyo, Japan

Yoko strolled quickly through the market place. It was hard to believe 
that it was a weekday. The market was almost empty. The stalls had been 
shut down, the shops were mostly closed, and the marketplace itself was 
completely barren. As Yoko walked through the blank area, her head 
turned from side to side to see if there was any place that might be 
open. There was only one. Down at the end of the market square, on the 
edge of the district. Any further would lead into Shibuya. Yoko 
quickened her pace. For some reason, she really didn&#146;t want to keep 
Xiangau waiting for a change in dressings. He was still asleep, but Yoko 
felt responsible for him. A feeling that probably wouldn&#146;t go away until 
he was awake. 

Yoko walked through the market square and to the open shop. Yoko knew 
full well that is was the chemist. They were a well priced store, and 
the owner knew Yoko fairly well, so there would be no confusion here. 
The last thing she needed was for someone to ask her what the dressings 
were for. Yoko came to the door and stepped in, the bell above the door 
ringing to signal her entrance. The only thing was, that the owner of 
the store was not the only one in the shop. Two young men, both around 
19 in age, bumped past Yoko on their way out. They were quick and 
gormless, ad is they were hiding a secret. She was troubled by their 
sly, rough behaviour, but ignored this and walked over to the counter. 
The dressings she needed for Xiangau were on a shelf, and she snagged 
them on the way there. 

&#147;Good morning, Mr. Namuya.&#148; Yoko greeted him. &#147;I&#146;d like these please.&#148;

Mr. Namuya had a chilled look in his eye. Yoko noticed it. She didn&#146;t 
like it one bit. &#147;Is something wrong, sir?&#148;

Mr. Namuya shook his head. &#147;N-No&#133; It&#146;s fine, Yoko. What can I do for 
you?&#148;

&#147;Just these few dressings please.&#148;

Mr. Namuya nodded, then grabbed the items that Yoko had placed on the 
counter. He knew the prices already, so simply fetched a blue plastic 
and put them inside it for her Yoko went into the back pocket of her 
blue jeans and withdrew some paper yen. Yoko handed Mr. Namuya the 
money. He went into the cash register, handed her the receipt, then 
scuttled into the backroom of the shop. Yoko was strangely curious about 
his behaviour. He hadn&#146;t so much as said goodbye. 

&#145;Does it have something to do with those thugs?&#146; Yoko wondered. 

It didn&#146;t matter. Even though she liked Mr. Namuya, she wasn&#146;t going to 
try and investigate this. At least not now. Not with Xiangau in her 
need. Yoko took the plastic bag, then walked outside into market square. 
But it wasn&#146;t quite so barren as it was before. The moment she stepped 
through the door, and felt the cooling morning air, she realized that 
she was not alone. On the outside, surrounding the door into the 
chemist, were five thugs. Two of them were the ones that had bumped into 
Yoko. All their eyes were on her. Yoko lowered her own dark eyes and 
tried to ignore their looks. Less of contempt, and more of attraction. 
And Yoko had never been comfortable with the attention of men. All her 
life, despite her exotic feminine looks, she had been regarded as a 
tomboy. She didn&#146;t regard herself as beautiful. But the lusty glares she 
was receiving from these men seemed to speak differently. 

Yoko observed the five of them in short bursts. They were all tall, 
scruffily-dressed, their hair tousled and their eyes thin with intent. 
The one in the centre, was slightly shorter, a little younger-looking 
than the rest, but he seemed to have some sort of influence over them. 
From his immature smile, she doubted that he was the head honcho, but he 
looked to be a big player in this group.

&#147;Could you let me through please?&#148; Yoko asked politely

One of the men walked up to Yoko and grinned. &#147;What&#146;s your rush, honey? 
We got all the time in the world. Lets get to know each other better. I 
have nice little place downtown. Wanna swing by it?&#148;

&#147;It sounds like a wonderful offer,&#148; Yoko intended to hide her sarcasm, 
but it wasn&#146;t convincingly done. &#147;But I think I should be going home 
now.&#148;

Yoko began walking forward, till one grabbed her arm, saying. &#147;What&#146;s 
your rush? Stay with us. The White Crow Gang could use a few more 
whores! Ha, ha, ha, ha!&#148;

Yoko&#146;s eyes turned stone cold. &#147;&#133;What did you call me&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Heh, heh, heh! You heard what I- AAH!&#148;

The thug that had a grip around Yoko&#146;s arm leg go promptly. Nobody even 
saw what happened. One second he had his dirty hands on the girl, the 
next, his head was jerking back, stumbling over his feet and falling to 
the stone ground. When the youngest of the group saw the fearless Yoko&#146;s 
hand, which was retracting from a fist, he knew that  she had punched 
him. So fast that none of them had even seen it. 

Yoko&#146;s hard eyes rolled over to the rest of them. &#147;I don&#146;t wanna hurt 
anyone. So please just leave me alone.&#148;

The youngest of these scruffs walked forward. &#147;So. You&#146;re a fighter, 
huh? That was a fast punch for such a cute little girl. It was 
impressive But I can&#146;t let you get away with that. Y&#146;see, we of the 
White Crow Gang always get our way. Anybody who denies us what we want&#133; 
we lets say it ain&#146;t acceptable.&#148; 

There was no way out of this. &#147;You&#146;d take your fist to me?&#148;

&#147;Yup.&#148; The boy cracked his knuckles, &#147;Sorry. The last thing we wanna do 
is mess up that pretty little face of yours. But rules are rules, 
y&#146;know?&#148;

Yoko sighed She absolutely hated dealing with Tokyo gangs. So arrogant 
and rude.  And she wasn&#146;t exactly dressed for a fight, She was wearing 
only a tee shirt of her favourite band, the Valkyries, a pair of blue 
jeans and some wood-finish sandals. And even more than that, Xiangau was 
waiting. But if she could just beat this guy, maybe the others would 
disperse and leave her be. She had to take that assumption. Yoko dropped 
the bag to the ground slowly, then focused on the young man who was 
watching her. 

&#147;What&#146;s your name?&#148; Yoko asked 

&#147;Liang Ho Yung&#133;&#148; He replied. &#147;Second in command of the entire White Crow 
Gang.&#148;

So, this man was Chinese in origin. That wave of Chinese immigration had 
not been an underestimation It didn&#146;t matter though. Yoko just had to 
get past this man to get back to Xiangau and the Asagawa Training 
Facility. Yoko pulled up her fists and watched Liang&#146;s movements as he 
stepped around her. The others got into a circle surrounding the two of 
them. The man who Yoko had punched, however, was out cold. Yoko 
continued to watch the other man as he came closer She had to end this 
thing quickly, so that she could be on her way.  Giving a little yell, 
Liang charged her. Yoko stood her ground as her came within striking 
range. Liang tried to punch her. Yoko swiftly ducked under it and 
reversed her body in spin, drawing her leg out. In a vicious flash of 
movement, the flat heel of her sandaled foot slapped Liang&#146;s cheek. He 
growled with frustration, being forced away from the girl. Liang 
clutched his cheek with both hands. He was bruised, already. Yoko stood 
up and gave him a blank look. This was a meaningless fight. And Liang Ho 
Yung would end up getting hurt if it continued

&#147;Just stand aside,&#148; Yoko asked desperately, &#147;Please?&#148;

The boy had a furious look in his eye. &#147;Why you! How dare you? You&#146;ll 
pay for that!&#148;

He ran forwards for Yoko. As soon as he reached her, he crouched down 
and swept his leg under her feet. Yoko was too concerned with his safety 
to have noticed that, so fell backwards, her back roughly touching to 
the ground. Liang sneered, then vaulted upwards, jumping above Yoko. In 
midair, he reversed his position and began descending, projecting both 
of his hands in a claw-like shape, yelling, 

&#147;Raven Attacking Worm!&#148;

Yoko sighed She saw that coming a mile away. The girl rolled away, and 
Liang Ho Yung&#146;s palms both touched the arena floor, getting grazed. He 
looked up, then over to Yoko. Who had already managed to stand and 
resume a fighting stance. 

&#145;Impossible!&#146; Liang thought sharply. &#145;How could she have dodged the 
R.A.W? That is my most powerful attack&#133;!&#146; 

Liang continued thinking, then ran for Yoko again. His guard had not bee 
brought up during his stride. Yoko could see that Liang Ho Yung was 
inexperienced. He left so many openings and left everything unguarded. 
And he was the second in command of this group? Yoko sidestepped as 
Liang attempted a punch,  then through one of her own. She nailed him, 
right in the side of his stomach, making Liang Ho Yung cough and wheeze. 
Yoko rose right up, whereas Liang fell to his knees, wrapping his hands 
around his stomach The rest of the group of five began to back up as 
Yoko turned her attentions on them.

&#147;Does anyone else want to try me? Or can I go home?&#148;

&#147;Hold&#133;&#148;

That was not spoken by one of the five. The Asagawa-girl looked over to 
her left. Three additional men stepped up to the plate. But unlike the 
careless thugs that Yoko had tangled with, these three were somehow 
dignified. Especially the one at the centre. His hair was of a strident 
blonde, obviously dyed, and looked to be about a couple years older than 
Yoko was. His was fully clad in a rich Chinese fighting uniform, of navy 
blue and polished silver. Though the other members of the White Crow 
Gang were rough and scraggy street punks, the attire that this boy was 
in seemed to say that he was a serious player. And in fact, Yoko could 
sense a strength inside him that far transcended that of the others. He 
was a real fighter, not like the fragile Liang Ho Yung. The three other 
members of the White Crow Gang came up and surveyed that damaged done to 
the group. Two were down, though Liang&#146;s defeat seemed to attribute more 
concern to them. 

The man at the head of the three looked over at Yoko. &#147;This is your 
doing?&#148;

&#147;They started this.&#148; Yoko defended. &#147;All I wanted was to go home. But 
they grabbed me and&#133;&#148;

The dyed blonde boy shook his head. &#147;I understand. Forgive Liang. My 
brother is a bit impulsive when it comes to fighting.&#148;

&#147;Brother?&#148; Yoko questioned. &#147;He&#146;s your brother?&#148;

He nodded, the proceeded introduce himself. &#147;Yes. My name is Jin Han 
Yung. I am the leader of the White Crow Gang and successor of Kuen Moo 
school of Kempo. I would like to apologize for my brother. He is very 
difficult. But I want to resolve this situation, also.&#148;

Yoko gave him a questioning look. &#147;How?&#148;

&#147;One last fight,&#148; Jin offered, making a gesture with his hand. &#147;With me. 
If I win, you pardon my brother and we say no more of this. If you win, 
we will follow our gang&#146;s code and owe you a debt, to be repaid at any 
time you wish.&#148;

In truth, Yoko just wanted to go home. But, in a way, she was very 
curious about Jin&#146;s strength. A little battle with him wouldn&#146;t take too 
long, would it? Yoko decided to agree. Though it was strange, her 
fighting spirit was thrilled to great lengths at the possibility of 
getting a good challenge It was like it was in her blood.

&#147;Okay&#133; let&#146;s do it.&#148;
