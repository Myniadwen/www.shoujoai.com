<h1>The Student and the Goddess (part 12 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>      Erin was aware of a warm surface. And it was comfy. She languidly moved closer to it, 
not minding the hand stroking her head or the hand caressing her waist. Nope, she didn&#39;t 
mind it at all. She nuzzled into the warmth and started to awake when she heard a slight 
giggle. She opened her eyes, not quite sure what she was looking at.

      As she pulled away reluctantly from the warmth, Erin almost fell off the couch and 
onto the floor. Somehow, sometime, Faye had returned. And she was sitting on the couch. Only 
problem was for the last who knows how long, Erin had been asleep... and she&#39;d just so 
happened to somehow be asleep, sitting in Faye&#39;s lap with her head nuzzling up against the 
crook of the flower shop owner&#39;s neck.

      &quot;Ah, you&#39;re awake.&quot; Erin tried to move off, but Faye was quite strong. &quot;Sorry if I 
startled you. You were sleeping and I didn&#39;t want to bother you!&quot; That didn&#39;t explain how 
they ended up in a compromising position, but she really didn&#39;t want to ask the red head how 
that happened.

      &quot;Are you starting you remember stuff?&quot; Faye asked, taking the hand stroking Erin&#39;s 
head and using it to adjust the blue baseball cap on her head. &quot;K-kind of. It&#39;s not really 
making sense, but... I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll figure it out.&quot;

      Faye smiled. &quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; Erin let out a sigh of content as Faye&#39;s hand went back to 
stroking her head and playing with her tresses. &quot;Well, aren&#39;t you easy to please?&quot; She 
blushed at the red head&#39;s comment, but said nothing. They sat there for awhile, watching a 
few shows until Faye got up.

      Erin let out a squeal as she was picked up by the other woman. Faye in no way seemed 
to be athletic (the hat only made her look tomboyish) so Erin was surprised that she was 
lifted with such ease. &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking that the guest bed probably isn&#39;t too great for 
you... you can share my bed instead!&quot; Somehow, the dark haired girl had a bad feeling about 
this...

      Faye diligently carried her to what was presumably her bedroom. Erin had been 
expecting a typical room, maybe a bed with a nice colorful duvet and a desk, or something... 
Of course, Faye just had to have something crazy. When they entered, the first thing Erin 
noticed was the bed. Practically the whole room was the bed... alright, maybe only half.

      It was a canopy style bed, but it was covered in what Erin could only presume was silk 
sheets and fluffy pillows. There was a white furry blanket covering it all and the elegance 
was astounding. The room looked out of this world... it was more like a palace bedroom. Had 
they entered a dimensional rift?

      Erin looked up to see Faye smiling at her. A little voice in the back of her head 
pointed out that the bed looked like something akin to a love nest. Great. Ever since she 
remembered the lesbian couple, she&#39;d been starting to wonder about Faye. And THIS definitely 
crossed the line. Of course, she was praying quietly that she was wrong.

      Faye set her down and let out a sigh. &quot;It&#39;s pretty awesome; I know. You&#39;ll probably 
have a nice rest tonight, but...&quot; She put her hands on Erin&#39;s shoulders and started to guide 
towards another door in the room. The dark haired girl thought Faye&#39;s hands were a little 
too close to her chest. &quot;You should take a bath first. You&#39;ll feel lots better.&quot;

      Erin took a peek at the bathroom and nearly fainted. There was an extravagant bathroom 
to accentuate the extravagant bedroom. It looked more like a Roman bathhouse than an actual 
bathroom. The bath wasn&#39;t too big, but it made Erin wonder how all of this fit into Faye&#39;s 
one-story house.

      She turned around to look at the red head. &quot;H-how...?&quot; Faye just giggled and squeezed 
her shoulders. &quot;It&#39;s a guilty pleasure... but you look really pale...&quot; She let one hand 
caress Erin&#39;s cheek. &quot;Do you want me to help you?&quot;

      It took Erin a minute to realize what kind of &#39;help&#39; she was offering. &quot;N-no! I can 
bathe myself-&quot; Faye cut her off. &quot;Are you sure? You&#39;re still unwell...&quot;

      &quot;No! Nononono! I&#39;m fine.&quot;

      &quot;Really? It would just be easier for the both of us. I mean; there&#39;s room in there-&quot;

      &quot;Thanks, but I&#39;m good!&quot; Erin shut the door before Faye could say anything else. She 
wanted to collapse, but reminded herself that if she didn&#39;t hurry up with her bath, Faye 
would use it as an excuse to come in. She didn&#39;t want that. Erin let out a sigh as she took 
off her clothes. Just then, she wondered if Faye had dressed her... She gulped and blushed. 
No matter who it was, it was always awkward to think of who was dressing you and-

      She froze in the middle of taking of the white camisole beneath the shirt. Hadn&#39;t 
someone dressed her the night she was kidnapped? Was she kidnapped at night? Erin took off 
the piece of clothing before removing her shorts and underwear.

      Yes, yes, yes! That was right! The lesbian couple were dressing her because she got 
drunk because she was surrounded by lesbian couples and... and... She remembered somebody - 
a friend - opened a bottle of champagne and drunk herself into submission.

      Erin frowned. Her memories were starting to sound more like a drunken night at a frat 
party. How did she even know what a frat party was in the first place? She none too 
gracefully entered the bath and sighed. It felt nice... very nice... She would question 
Faye&#39;s living arrangements later.

      There was a tray with soap and shampoo conveniently nearby. As she washed herself, 
Erin tried to rack her brain. She could remember people, but not the names. She&#39;d been 
kidnapped once, saved by lesbians, taken to a house with more lesbians, then she was dressed 
by the girls who saved her and then she was kidnapped again.

      Oh, yeah, and she had some champagne with a crazy older friend whose name she couldn&#39;t 
remember. At least the bath was wonderful. Screw the fact that Faye managed to freak her out 
- the older girl was a kind hostess and she had an amazing house.

      Erin snapped out of her reverie as she heard a voice. &quot;You seem to be enjoying 
yourself.&quot; She turned around to see Faye sitting on the edge, her feet dangling in the bath. 
Erin struggled to find a way to conceal herself (it didn&#39;t help that she could feel those 
teal eyes staring) but she could only cross her arms over her chest and wish the water 
wasn&#39;t so clear.

      Faye just giggled. &quot;You don&#39;t need to hide. I had to dress you when I first found 
you...&quot; Erin just let out a squeak, her face bright red. &quot;What are you doing in here?&quot;

      The red head patted a stack of towels next to her. &quot;Since you ran into the bathroom 
like that, you forgot to take a towel with you,&quot; Faye said, smiling, as though it wasn&#39;t 
strange at all for her to be there. &quot;I brought some.&quot;

      Erin just nodded dumbly. &quot;Th-thank you... um... Faye? C-can you stop looking...?&quot; The 
red head laughed some more, before getting up. &quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t help it. Naughty me.&quot; Erin 
felt like the tub was a boiling pot. She wanted to get out and grab a towel, but then she 
would be stark naked in front of Faye. Talk about frying pan and into the fire.

      The red head turned around and Erin thought it was her chance to get out. However, her 
luck just got worse as Faye took off her hat and removed her t-shirt. The first thing Erin 
noticed was that Faye&#39;s hair was a mess. It must have quite some length because it was kept 
up in a messy bun with a myriad of clips and pins and barrettes.

      The second thing Erin noticed was that Faye took off her shirt. And was taking off her 
bra. &quot;Wh-what are you doing?&quot; The red head just looked over her shoulder. &quot;Hmm? Well I&#39;m 
already in here so why not? I mean, We can take care of each other since we can wash each 
other&#39;s hair and other things we can&#39;t reach.&quot;

      Erin was as red as a lobster. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re alright? You look like you got a 
fever...&quot; Regardless of Faye&#39;s worried expression and tone, Erin could see that glint in her 
eyes that said Faye knew exactly what was wrong. &quot;No... I&#39;m good... I-I already washed my 
hair so, uh... hahahaha.&quot;

      Erin looked away for a second and when she looked back, Faye was naked except for the 
panties she was about to pull down. Thank goodness the red head had her back to Erin. At 
that point, the dark haired girl scrambled out of the bath and quickly covered herself with 
a towel. If she kept waiting, she&#39;d probably find herself in a nude embrace with Faye. She 
flushed at the thought.

      &quot;Are you leaving already?&quot; Erin didn&#39;t turn around when Faye spoke. &quot;Um, yeah... You 
know, pr-privacy and all. I don&#39;t want to disturb you...&quot; She heard Faye walk up behind her. 
&quot;Really? Too bad... Oh and you don&#39;t have to be so shy. You can look if you want; we&#39;re both 
girls.&quot;

      Faye wrapped her arms around Erin&#39;s shoulders playfully. Seeing as Faye was taller, 
she stooped a bit and rested her head on Erin&#39;s shoulder to look at her. &quot;You&#39;re really 
red... I can cool down the bath if you have a fever.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m fine... really... I promise...?&quot; Erin murmured, now trying to find a way out of 
the predicament. She slipped out of Faye&#39;s grasp. &quot;I-I&#39;ll just go now...&quot; She put her hand 
on the door handle and started to go out. &quot;Suit yourself; it would have been fun.&quot;

      Erin shut the door and didn&#39;t even want to think about what kind of &#39;fun&#39; Faye was 
talking about. It gave her an uneasy feeling, but... somehow, it felt like this had happened 
before. She walked over to the bed to see two sets of clothes laid out. She figured they 
were supposed to be improvised pajamas and she grabbed the smaller set. Faye was a little 
bigger than her, so...

      She dressed herself before sitting on the bed. It was even comfier than it looked... 
and she had yet to go under the covers! Erin started drying her hair and grabbed the brush 
off Faye&#39;s desk. She really, really disliked how long her hair had become. She was pretty 
sure it wasn&#39;t this long a week ago. Even thought she could barely remember that week... or 
that month.

      Just when she was done dealing with her mass of locks, Faye emerged from the bathroom 
and Erin looked away awkwardly. Go figure that the towel Faye was using was just a tad bit 
too small... She continued to look away as Faye nonchalantly dropped the towel and got 
dressed. &quot;You&#39;re quite a bashful person, Erin.&quot;

      She only blushed. &quot;It&#39;s just... kind of weird. I don&#39;t want to be caught staring at 
you or something.&quot;

      &quot;I wouldn&#39;t mind.&quot;

      At that moment Erin turned around in shock to look at Faye. All she had on was a 
t-shirt and panties. The red head giggled at her expression. &quot;Really. It&#39;s alright. There&#39;s 
nothing wrong with two girls admiring each other.&quot;

      Oh yes there was, at least if one girl thought the other one had questionable motives. 
Faye sat down on the bed next to her, drying her extremely long hair. It was a lot thicker 
than Erin&#39;s and at least went down to her butt. How Faye kept it all tucked under a hat was 
beyond her...

      &quot;Oh, Erin? Can you do me a favor?&quot; Erin gulped, but nodded. Faye was kind enough so 
there wasn&#39;t any reason to be rude. &quot;Can you brush my hair? It&#39;s really hard to do myself, 
so...&quot; Erin just smiled. &quot;Of course... you&#39;ve been really nice to me so far so why not?&quot;

      Faye smiled mischievously before getting up and sitting down in between Erin&#39;s thighs. 
The dark haired girl held back a sigh. Go figure. She started to run the brush through 
Faye&#39;s hair and reveled in how wonderful it was. However, something bothered her.

      She was quite sure that Faye&#39;s hair color was natural, even if the shade itself was 
unusual. Then again, she was the one with the dark green hair... so Erin really shouldn&#39;t be 
talking. It was hard to brush the ends of Faye&#39;s hair seeing how the two of them were 
positioned, but she managed.

      When Erin finished, Faye got up happily and push Erin down on the bed. &quot;Alright! Why 
don&#39;t we get some sleep?&quot; She walked over to the wall to shut off the lights while Erin 
crawled on the bed before getting under the covers.

      As everything went dark, Erin reveled in how wonderful the sheets felt. She no longer 
thought it was silk - it had to be something better. It wasn&#39;t too hot, but instead it felt 
nice and cool against her skin. The bed was big, so she barely felt Faye enter it.

      But of course, even though there was enough room for the two of them to be spread out, 
Faye somehow managed to grab Erin by the waist and pull her up flush against her chest. Erin 
awkwardly found her hands splayed on Faye&#39;s back, her face buried in the crook of her neck. 
Her red hair smelled wonderful.

      &quot;Hee hee. You&#39;re blushing, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Erin said nothing in regards to that comment. 
Instead she sighed happily as a hand started to stroke her head and another rubbed her lower 
back. Whenever Faye did that, Erin no longer felt scared of her. She didn&#39;t understand. Not 
one bit.

      &quot;Do I make you that nervous?&quot; Erin took a breath before answering. &quot;...yes... I 
mean... kind of.&quot;

      Faye just laughed in the dark before nipping at her ear. &quot;Good. That&#39;s what I 
expected...&quot; Erin let out a small yelp, but let Faye hold her. It felt strange, but nice. 
Very nice. Even better than the sheets around her body...

      In no time at all, Erin fell asleep, unconsciously nuzzling into Faye&#39;s neck. The red 
head let out a sigh. &quot;Some things never change.&quot;
