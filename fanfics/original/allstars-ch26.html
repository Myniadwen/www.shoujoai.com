7:25 am

 

Emma-Jean Kafu erupted out of her bed with a violent start, and tumbled 
out to fall on the floor-her alarm was in perfect working order, it 
seemed. Injured and droopy, she considered whether or not to sleep on 
the hard floor, risking deafness as she endured the alarm&#39;s drilling 
sound. Regrettably, she could barely keep her eyes open, and so climbed 
up to the small table in her room and slapped the machine with all her 
might, silencing it. The door opened not two seconds later, finally 
snapping her out of her blurry funk. She glared and spat acid at the 
intruder, but her emotions were wasted: it was May, dear beloved May, 
her adopted sister and one of the few people she could never be angry 
at.

&quot;Well, good morning, sunshine!&quot; she exclaimed. Wiping strands of dark 
amber hair from her face, Emma-Jean muttered and forced herself to stand 
up.

&quot;Shut up, May. God, I have the weirdest sense of deja vu. What time is 
it?&quot;

&quot;You should know, you set that alarm. C&#39;mon, you don&#39;t wanna be late for 
your first day at school, do you?&quot;

&quot;First day?&quot; That&#39;s right, she was in college now. How could she forget 
something like that? But then Emma-Jean looked at her calendar and 
glared at her sister. It was last day of August, which meant she had 
been at school this semester for two weeks now. &quot;You nut-bar, it&#39;s 
Friday! Tomorrow&#39;s the...crap!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the what now?&quot; May said. Combining willpower and stubborn 
fortitude, Emma-Jean vaulted out of the floor and dashed into the 
bathroom, wanting to get all the hot water before it was gone. May 
knocked on the door in an attempt to conclude their aborted 
conversation. &quot;What were you saying now?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t pretend you don&#39;t know, ding-dong! Tomorrow&#39;s that practice game! 
Zafe and all the others will be there!&quot;

&quot;Practice game for what?&quot;

&quot;You chowder-head, read my freakin&#39; calendar! The soccer game! Anolis is 
going up against that new school- uhh, darn, I forgot which one!&quot;

&quot;Carnegie,&quot; May suggested as she peeked at her sister&#39;s notes.

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the one! Hey, stop pretending you don&#39;t know!&quot; May giggled 
and apologized. So, Anolis versus Carnegie, eh...

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;Meet the Competition&quot;

 

Leena asked for a congratulatory round of applause as Freya Hohenheim 
gently stepped onto the field, supported by her faithful duet. Everyone 
clapped as she smiled and thanked them for their support; they were 
happy to have their manager back and in good health (well, nearly all of 
them. Fleur rolled her eyes and only struck her palms together for 
show).

&quot;Sorry for worrying you all!&quot; she exclaimed, waving in the air. &quot;As you 
can see, I&#39;m all right now. Luckily, I didn&#39;t slip into a coma or 
anything, and once I get some exercise, I&#39;ll feel ev- &quot;

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!&quot; Shiki exclaimed, guiding her mistress to the bench. 
&quot;You only got released yesterday, and you weren&#39;t even able to walk 
until this morning! Do you want to put all your hard work to waste and 
collapse again?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just a little stroll, Araya-chan,&quot; Freya muttered offensively. 
&quot;Sierra never said I had to lay down all day doing nothing. Or do you 
want me to atrophy?&quot;

&quot;No, milady, of course not! You&#39;re just not strong enough, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;And how do you propose I become stronger? By resting?&quot;

&quot;All right, you two, that&#39;s enough,&quot; Maria said, bringing them together 
and smiling. &quot;The important thing is that our dear manager is fine and 
we can get back to the game.&quot;

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s absolutely right!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;So tell me what&#39;s 
happened in my absence. I hope you haven&#39;t collapsed without me holding 
you up.&quot;

&quot;They managed,&quot; Leena chuckled. The team looked offended that Freya 
could think so poorly of them, even though they knew she was kidding.

&quot;I feel like we&#39;ve gotten a lot better,&quot; Alice murmured. &quot;Or most of us, 
anyway.&quot;

&quot;Have you been working very hard?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve tried,&quot; Fausta sighed. &quot;But between work and school, it&#39;s been 
hard. Anolis may very well kick our asses tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;This from the woman who refused to back down from a challenge?&quot; Fleur 
sang tartly.

&quot;You don&#39;t even have the right to complain seeing as you&#39;re still 
hobbling along.&quot; Fleur snorted and stomped her bad foot against the 
ground.

&quot;Hmph! For your information, I can walk quite sufficiently now. I just 
can&#39;t run, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;re still down a player?&quot; Freya said. Leena sighed.

&quot;It can&#39;t be helped. At least we have plenty of reserves, although I&#39;m 
skittish about sending Essylt in. No offense, Essylt.&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; she nodded. &quot;But I&#39;ll do my best for Fleur&#39;s sake.&quot; She 
smiled eerily and waved at the vainglorious brunette, who rolled her 
eyes.

&quot;Still am having one more day before big next game,&quot; Nadia said. &quot;After 
school now, plenty of time for having practice. Is like, what you say, 
stuffing big before test.&quot;

&quot;Cramming,&quot; Jennifer corrected. &quot;Ugh, don&#39;t remind me about tests, 
either. I&#39;ve got a big one on Monday.&quot;

&quot;Cramming&#39;s always worked for me before,&quot; Valencia said, clapping extra 
loud to rouse herself. &quot;Let&#39;s just see where this takes us. I&#39;m going to 
run a few laps and then practice catching. Kasumi, Felicity, don&#39;t hold 
back!&quot; She winked at the former and jogged off, with several other girls 
following. Fausta sighed and massaged her face; Leena touched her 
shoulder empathetically.

&quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;We are getting better,&quot; she confessed, feeling slightly flustered in 
the presence of a woman she admired, &quot;but we&#39;re still not good enough. 
I&#39;ve seen Anolis in action once, and it was enough to draw concern.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re forgetting that we&#39;re the underdog here,&quot; Arina said. &quot;Anolis 
has a record of playing well only against teams it believes are their 
equals, particularly their rival Triskelion. I doubt they&#39;ve even heard 
of us. Do you really believe they&#39;ll bring their A-game to an obscure 
field like ours?&quot; Fausta lit up as she realized the team psychologist 
was right.

&quot;Wow, I never thought of it like that. If we put up the illusion that 
we&#39;re as mediocre as our reputation describes, they&#39;ll get sloppy. But 
don&#39;t forget that Julius Caesar feared Cassius, who &#39;had a lean and 
hungry look&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Good point. It will be a very interesting match.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got to offer,&quot; she sighed. Fausta then snorted 
and smiled at Leena in defeat. &quot;I guess I should quit my bitching and 
get to it.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t hurt,&quot; she smiled. After everyone circled the field a few 
times, they assumed their positions and began their drills. Shannon 
immediately suggested that she and Fausta help Valencia with her task, 
since it would bring more variety with the shots. Durante thought it was 
a great idea and asked that they revolve one after the other, each one 
making a shot she would likely use in a real situation.

&quot;Pretty lady needz help with something too?&quot; Nadia offered. Elisa nodded 
shyly and asked for help with driving the ball down the field. Freya 
threw them one from the cage and the two girls batted the ball back and 
forth between them as they traveled towards the other goal, where Lauren 
was doing pull-ups. She cheered for them and let the ball sail by.

&quot;You two look totally sexy out there, I mean it. Here, see if Valencia&#39;s 
ready for ya.&quot; They drove it back to their own goal and shot the ball 
before Durante could react. However, she obeyed her instincts and jumped 
after it, catching it on her arms.

&quot;Wonderful!&quot; Terra exclaimed. &quot;You&#39;re really getting better!&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m still getting wiped out too soon,&quot; Val said, breathing hard as 
she threw the ball back. She called time and asked for a towel and some 
water. Meanwhile, Arina and Alice ran laps together, and they encouraged 
Amy to join them.

&quot;We&#39;ll bring all the A&#39;s together and confuse people,&quot; Essylt giggled. 
Amy didn&#39;t catch on for a few seconds, then rolled her eyes. She 
preferred practicing by herself and didn&#39;t pay much mind to anyone else 
until Leena called her out.

&quot;Nguyen, is there a problem? This isn&#39;t foosball. Pair up with someone 
and run through the drills. Here- go with Ofdensen. She looks lonely.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, Coach!&quot; Lauren called. She grinned at Amy but didn&#39;t get quite 
the reaction she was hoping for. &quot;So, uh, whaddya have in mind? I mean, 
you could try kicking and I could try catching if you want.&quot;

&quot;S-sure.&quot; Leena sent Jennifer to join them, and with Fleur walking 
around retrieving stray balls with Freya, everyone was doing something 
to keep herself occupied. Leena made sure that everyone ran through at 
least four different drills before the end of the day: she didn&#39;t want 
them neglecting anything. They were all weary when she blew the whistle 
and dismissed them, asking them to show up at the field tomorrow morning 
at 6:30 as they had for their first practice game.

&quot;So make sure you get plenty of rest beforehand. Remember to keep to 
your diets, also! I don&#39;t want anybody drinking anything but water or 
milk until the practice games are over! That includes sports drinks: I 
don&#39;t trust them.&quot;

&quot;Blech, milk,&quot; Nadia grimaced.

&quot;You mean we can&#39;t even have tea? Or juice?&quot; Jen wailed.

&quot;No caffeine. Hot green tea is fine. Juice is okay, too, so long as it 
doesn&#39;t have unnatural sugars. Keep everyone accountable, and good 
practice today! Make me proud tomorrow, team.&quot; Fausta gave Leena a 
fairly confident nod, even though she still had her doubts about the 
team&#39;s abilities. No matter how anybody else played tomorrow, she would 
give it everything she got. Somehow she would redeem herself, even if 
she was the only one that knew it.

 

- Felicity Velur, Hobbies: watching &quot;House&quot;, collecting iPod songs; 
forward-

 

Shannon Threal made an exception today and showered with the others, but 
only enough to wash off her sweat, and only because she had work later. 
The deli she worked at would be rough today: not only because it was a 
Friday and closing in on dinnertime, but because the rumor mill was 
saying that the team from Anolis University would be coming into town 
today, and with them, more devoted fans and followers than you could 
count. No doubt some of the others would be inundated as well; it would 
be difficult getting off work early.

&quot;I&#39;m heah,&quot; she said to her manager, a tall wiry man with hard eyes and 
dark stubble. He grinned sickly and, instead of barking at her, pointed 
at everything he expected her to handle for the day. Here, take this 
order; we need that lettuce chopped up; the grill needs cleaning; ask 
Barney to take his break; put the cash drawer in the vault; fill up the 
soda syrup. He was deathly quiet, and therefore, the best manager you 
could ask for. It wasn&#39;t a glamorous job and the pay was debatable, but 
it kept her busy, she could wear fairly nice clothes, and she could have 
as many free lunches and leftovers as she could handle.

Like anyone who works at a place long enough, Shannon had her familiar 
customers she recognized and even a few she could address by name. 
Jennifer paid her a visit and hung around to chat and eat, and Elisa 
came by as well (with Nadia in tow), offering a sweet smile. She even 
spotted Kathlyn coming by to get lunch for two.

&quot;Prr Gardnna,&quot; Jen mumbled between bites. &quot;Uff we- scuse&#39; me- keep this 
up, she&#39;ll be out of business. Maybe we should make this our new hangout 
spot instead.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know we had one, officially,&quot; Elisa replied.

&quot;Try some othah place,&quot; Shannon said snappishly. &quot;I don&#39;t want all yah 
lesbo-cooties in my place. It&#39;s bad enough we sheah the same field and 
showah room.&quot;

&quot;You are not to liking us?&quot; Nadia whimpered. Shannon grunted and thrust 
her lunch into her arms.

&quot;I ain&#39;t comf&#39;table with it, is all. Most of ya seem like okay people, 
with a few glarin&#39; exceptions.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a lesbian,&quot; Jen defended. &quot;Terra&#39;s not either, I don&#39;t think.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see how you&#39;d know,&quot; Elisa said. She excused herself suddenly 
and stepped aside: a handful of other girls were streaming towards the 
counter. Nadia waved at them: she loved messing with strangers&#39; minds by 
acting friendly to them.

&quot;So what&#39;s good here?&quot; said the one at the front of the line. She peered 
at the menu closely, juggling with the myriad of possibilities. &quot;Please 
tell me you&#39;ve got a vegetarian meal. Meat makes me so sick.&quot;

&quot;Beef iz bad,&quot; Nadia agreed. The woman had a vivid handmade tunic on 
with colors of red, blue, white, gold, and green stitched into the 
fabric, woven as tiny lozenges that ultimately created the image of a 
motherly sun embracing a silent, expressionless Earth. She also had a 
headband, moccasins, and a long skirt, all made by her hands, all 
pointing to her affinity with the earth.

&quot;We just got a meatless menu, ovah there,&quot; Shannon pointed. Since we all 
know that &quot;vegetarian&quot; usually doesn&#39;t mean &quot;salads only&quot;, the menu 
offered a creative variety of dishes that were surprisingly popular: 
mushroom lasagna, curry rice, grilled cheese and tomato soup, various 
flavors of ramen, sushi, and Greek pizza, just to name a few.

&quot;Oh wow, you guys are on the ball! That&#39;s pretty metropolitan for an 
out-of-the-way burg like this. Uh, Voirrey, what do you want?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be happy splitting whatever you get,&quot; answered the woman directly 
behind her. She was dressed like a girl fresh out of Wall Street, black 
blouse and hosiery, a womanly tie and designer perfume. The two girls 
couldn&#39;t be more opposite and yet they seemed inseparable.

&quot;Cheapskate,&quot; snorted Nature girl. &quot;That&#39;s another one you owe me. Well, 
I know how you hate olives, so I&#39;ll have two slices of Greek pizza!&quot;

&quot;Ass,&quot; Voirrey murmured.

&quot;Comin&#39; right up,&quot; Shannon smiled, amused by their bickering. She cooked 
half the orders and rang up the other half according to her schedule, 
but for a few hectic minutes every day, she did both.

&quot;What&#39;s the holdup, you two?&quot; she heard an antsy voice say. Shannon 
hated impatient customers and couldn&#39;t help feeling angered: she was 
only one person, after all, and the line was growing dangerously long. 
&quot;Why can&#39;t you two ever agree on something as simple as food?&quot;

&quot;Different people have different tastes, Ash,&quot; Nature Girl retorted.

&quot;You&#39;re certainly one to talk about disagreeing,&quot; Voirrey added. Ash 
pouted.

&quot;Sonata and I have very similar tastes, I&#39;ll have you know. Oh crap, 
there&#39;s only one person working there!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, for a few minutes,&quot; Shannon called. &quot;I gotta handle both fronts 
for awhile since there&#39;s a gap between coworkers.&quot;

&quot;Sorry I sounded impatient! Now why did you two have to go and ask for 
something complicated like Gree- &quot;

&quot;Two slices,&quot; Shannon said, presenting them in individual boxes. 
Voirrey&#39;s companion paid for them and stuck her tongue out; Voirrey left 
a tip for Shannon&#39;s troubles.

&quot;Maybe should all be coming to Lily for meal,&quot; Nadia remarked as she saw 
the line increasing. Shannon&#39;s coworker (along with her manager) was 
nowhere in sight and the poor woman was rushing just to keep up with 
demand. This was not a job for wimps and Shannon had to continuously 
demonstrate how tough she was. She barely spoke, unless to yell about 
&quot;being swamped&quot;, and was always on the move.

&quot;What&#39;s Lily?&quot; Nature Girl asked. Nadia explained the basic concept of 
the Lily Club, and she lit up with a grin. &quot;Wow, cool, yeah! Wish we 
knew about that before! Rey and I just stopped ay the first place we 
could find! We don&#39;t know our way around very well.&quot;

&quot;Are you new to town?&quot; Elisa said. They all were, she replied: Voirrey, 
Ashandra (one called her Ash), Sonata, and herself, little Paola.

&quot;A lot of us came here to watch the game,&quot; she explained.

&quot;And there&#39;s more than our little group. I think...uh, Tamarit and 
Reekau are in the line, somewhere. I know they followed us here- uh, 
yep, there&#39;s Tam now. She sees us. Hi! And you know that if Reekau&#39;s 
here, those girlfriends of his aren&#39;t far behind.&quot;

&quot;Erase the plural!&quot; screamed a young lady near the head of the line. The 
crowd turned to glance at her and she shrank under their collective 
stares.

&quot;That would be Emma-Jean,&quot; Sonata said. &quot;I should correct myself: she&#39;s 
just a friend who happens to be a girl. But it&#39;s much more fun to tease 
her about it.&quot;

&quot;Is it really,&quot; Ashandra wondered. A beautiful, tomboyish woman was now 
at the head of the line, paying for two meals. She volunteered to help 
Shannon, and though she wasn&#39;t an employee, Threal was in no position to 
object.

&quot;Thanks!&quot; she exclaimed, wiping her face with a hand cloth. &quot;My asshole 
of a coworker&#39;s late, as always! He always manages to sneak in once the 
crowd&#39;s thinned out! I&#39;m Shannon, by the way.&quot;

&quot;Lothella,&quot; she smiled. Emma-Jean pointed at her as she donned an apron.

&quot;There she goes again, acting all girly! I swear, she&#39;s always losing 
her head like this! One day it&#39;ll just roll off, mark my words!&quot;

&quot;Hi, honey!&quot; Lothella waved, smiling gaily. Emma-Jean waved in an 
embarrassed manner. Nadia peered at the young woman closely, as if the 
two knew each other, but were separated by a great distance and the 
memory was difficult to grasp.

&quot;Have I been...seeing you elsewhere?&quot; she asked.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so.&quot;

&quot;I know you have been familiar. Iz like looking at person I knew.&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;ve only met three people with Russian accents, and they were 
either guys or really old people...but you do seem kind of familiar, 
I&#39;ll give you that.&quot;

&quot;So which side are you all rooting for?&quot; Elisa asked. The girls glanced 
at one another warily.

&quot;That&#39;s sort of...difficult to say. We&#39;re all here to watch Anolis- &quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just that we have different reasons,&quot; Sonata said mysteriously. 
Paola nodded.

&quot;Yeah. Some of us are from Anolis, and some...well, they&#39;re sort of our 
enemies.&quot;

&quot;Enemies?!&quot; All the girls from Carnegie and half of the newcomers 
squealed; they were equally surprised by this statement.

&quot;I think you mean your rivals, honey,&quot; Voirrey corrected. She smiled 
slyly and slapped Paola on the rear. &quot;I know it sounds a little clich&eacute;, 
but Paola and I are lovers who happen to be on rival teams.&quot;

&quot;Ah, sorta like Romeo and Juliet,&quot; Shannon exclaimed.

&quot;Uh, something like that. Ash and Sonata are in the same boat. Actually, 
a lot of people from Anolis and Triskelion are a couple.&quot;

&quot;Not us!&quot; Emma-Jean exclaimed proudly. She looked over at Lothella, who 
was humming merrily and looking perfectly at ease in the kitchen. She 
groaned. &quot;God, could she be any more femme?! And you call yourself a 
lesbian!&quot;

&quot;What can I say, I despise being conventional!&quot; she chirped. Jennifer 
laughed; she was starting to like these people, even though they would 
be cheering for her rivals.

&quot;Maybe we could give you guys a tour of the campus while you&#39;re here. Is 
this everyone that&#39;s in your group?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, we came in droves,&quot; Ash replied. &quot;This may be a practice game, 
but we love our teams and we support them no matter where we go. 
Besides, some of us are...friends of the players.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s sweet that you came all this way to cheer for them!&quot; Jen 
exclaimed. Ash coughed.

&quot;Uh, yeah. There&#39;s also people from Triskelion, of course, here to see 
how Anolis plays, as well as tailgaters like Emma-Jean and Sister 
Kanagawa who mooched a ride.&quot;

&quot;With my girlfriend,&quot; Emma-Jean reminded them.

&quot;Oh, cool. I don&#39;t think Carnegie will get that kind of following for 
awhile.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s still a young school,&quot; Sonata said. &quot;Things like this take awhile 
to catch on. Here, let&#39;s see what kind of delicacy the &#39;Headless 
horsewoman&#39; made for us.&quot; Lothella took deep offense to that and wailed.

&quot;Guys, seriously, quit using that name! It&#39;s just a coincidence!&quot; Sonata 
grinned as everyone took their meals and sat down. Lothella was finally 
relieved as Shannon&#39;s partner arrived, and of course, he didn&#39;t receive 
so much as a glare from the manager.

&quot;So what about you all?&quot; Paola said as Voirrey picked off the olives 
from her pizza. &quot;Are you Carnegie regulars or just roadies with nothing 
better to do?&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;re students,&quot; Jen said. &quot;We&#39;ve really been looking forward to 
this game.&quot;

&quot;Why? It&#39;s just for practice. You&#39;ll have plenty of those.&quot;

&quot;Apparently the Chairman of our board of directors made a wager with the 
Dean,&quot; Elisa said. &quot;He proposed that the team plays three practice games 
to justify their existence here, and if they can&#39;t win two, they have to 
be disbanded.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s bull crap!&quot; Paola snorted. &quot;What kind of ass does this guy think 
he is?&quot;

&quot;Mr. Fitzgerald was against team from beginning, or so people have been 
saying,&quot; Nadia told her. &quot;School had surplus budget and wanted money for 
extra...extra...um, sorry, very big word.&quot;

&quot;Extracurricular,&quot; Jen said.

&quot;Yes, right, bingo! So many people say what they want to use surplus 
for, and Miss Rosewood says she will have the football team. They voted 
for hers instead of Mr. Fitzgerald&#39;s music hall.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t they have both?&quot;

&quot;The budget was only big enough for one,&quot; Jen answered.

&quot;Oh. Well, can&#39;t this Fitzgerald guy just do a fundraiser and get the 
money himself?&quot;

&quot;Obviously not, or he wouldn&#39;t be using his energies to get rid of us,&quot; 
Elisa said.

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; Paola relented. &quot;How many of these games has Carnegie won 
so far?&quot;

&quot;One out of three. This next one could make or break us.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she grimaced. &quot;Oh, gosh. Well, shoot. I really hope they make it. 
I mean, I&#39;ll still be rooting for my friends, but...yeah, I&#39;ll be 
cheering for you guys, too, for what it&#39;s worth. Something like that 
shouldn&#39;t happen. You shouldn&#39;t have to hinge your entire career on just 
one game. It&#39;s stupid.&quot;

&quot;Most of us thought the same,&quot; Jen said. She then nodded to Shannon and 
added, &quot;But some of us understood why it was necessary for our 
development. We&#39;d never improve quickly enough if we were told to &#39;take 
our time and get used to it gradually&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Sounding like Arina!&quot; Nadia grinned. Jen chuckled as she drank her 
water.

&quot;Yeah, I do, don&#39;t I? So about that tour.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to bother,&quot; Sonata assured them. &quot;We won&#39;t be staying 
here very long anyway.&quot;

 

- Nadia Khovansky, Hobbies: drawing, making friends; defensive 
midfielder-

 

Amy Nguyen&#39;s soccer training may have been over, but she still had a 
martial arts class to attend, and as usual, Terra was coming with her. 
She brought Fausta along to fulfill a &quot;certain promise&quot;, and Fleur 
decided to tag along as well, since she heard there was a jogging track 
and she wanted to exercise her foot.

&quot;Y-you sh-sh-shouldn&#39;t p-press yours-self,&quot; Amy murmured.

&quot;I should,&quot; she replied stiffly. &quot;It needs movement. There&#39;s no...way 
I&#39;ll be able to make it for tomorrow, but if we lose, I don&#39;t want to 
sit on the sidelines twice. Besides, it&#39;s out of its cast, see?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your body,&quot; Fausta muttered. The gi she wore was very comfortable 
but not all that stylish; she had wanted something a little closer to 
her own tastes. Terra decided not to admonish her as she started warming 
up; Amy stretched alone while Fleur started pacing.

&quot;Come over here and join us, Amy,&quot; Terra offered, smiling gently. 
&quot;Fausta and I won&#39;t bite.&quot;

&quot;Let her do as she will.&quot;

&quot;Is that your answer to everything?&quot; she muttered. Fausta grunted as she 
revolved her right shoulder. Even after all this time healing, it still 
hurt to move...

&quot;I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s polite to interfere in people&#39;s business. So 
will you be teaching me, or do we have an instructor?&quot;

&quot;I can teach you if you like. I&#39;m not like a master or anything...&quot;

&quot;I suppose it&#39;ll be good enough,&quot; she sighed, rotating her good arm. 
Terra snorted at her.

God, what a bitch! Why does she act like that, even at work? Does she 
think she owns the world or something?

&quot;Something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Nah. What would you like to work on first?&quot;

&quot;My legs,&quot; said Fausta. &quot;And don&#39;t do anything that will put strain on 
this arm.&quot;

&quot;Right, so no grappling or flips, I take it.&quot; Fausta gave her an even 
stare which, hidden behind, held an inferno of impatience.

&quot;Obviously.&quot;

Bona fide asshole, she sighed as she demonstrated some basic moves. 
Still, she&#39;s really tough, and amazingly tenacious. And...yeah, 
drop-dead gorgeous, too. Hell, she even smells nice! Tsk...damn it, why 
is she wearing perfume to a dojo?

&quot;You sure nothing&#39;s wrong? You&#39;re making faces.&quot;

&quot;These are difficult moves to pull off,&quot; she covered. &quot;Let&#39;s see you try 
them and not wince.&quot;

&quot;Did you just talk back to me?&quot; she said sharply. Terra turned red, but 
Fausta laughed. &quot;And here I thought you were just a quiet little dork 
like Granveldt. So tell me something about yourself.&quot;

Holy Buddha in Nirvana, did I just...break the ice with her? Is that all 
it really takes?

&quot;Watch it, you oaf!&quot; Terra&#39;s revelation was broken as Fleur nearly fell 
over, stumbling against the mat and catching herself in Amy&#39;s clutches. 
Another student had crashed into her after being shoved away from a 
match.

&quot;Sorry there,&quot; he laughed, offering a kind hand. &quot;We got carried away. 
Are you two all right?&quot; Amy nodded stiffly, but Fleur, safely caught in 
her arms, was shaking and perspiring. Her face was pale, and her eyes 
burned.

&quot;It hurts,&quot; she said hoarsely, clinging to Amy like a child. &quot;God damn 
it all, it hurts like Hell. You made it worse. Don&#39;t just stand there, 
call an ambulance.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, did I really hurt you?&quot; Fleur kicked the poor man in the face 
when he bent down to check, but this caused her to howl loud enough to 
jar everyone in the dojo. She had stumbled in a way that strained her 
bad foot, twisting it and putting a great deal of pressure on it very 
suddenly. The dojo&#39;s medic cleared a path and examined it, tenderly 
removing Fleur&#39;s shoe and stocking. He sighed with relief as he noticed 
the bruise.

&quot;It&#39;s not too bad. The pain will wear off soon. How long have you had 
this?&quot;

&quot;Almost a week,&quot; she grumbled, too awash with pain to snap or shout. The 
medic whistled.

&quot;Your recovery is incredible. Most sprained ankles take twice as long to 
look this good.&quot;

&quot;Happy days. It feels like my bone broke through skin,&quot; Fleur cursed, 
gnashing her teeth. The medic smiled faintly.

&quot;You&#39;re perfectly fine, miss. Just take some Advil and rest easy. You&#39;re 
actually rather fortunate! If Miss Nguyen hadn&#39;t caught you, we would 
have called that ambulance.&quot; Fleur nodded weakly, an animal too injured 
to fight back.

&quot;Thanks. You already got your hug, so don&#39;t expect anything else. Let me 
sit down. Ow- SHIT!!!&quot;

&quot;So she&#39;s not in any danger?&quot; the young man said. The medic shook his 
head.

&quot;She should be perfectly fine early next week, at the rate her wound is 
going. You&#39;d think a woman that frail-looking would be hurt worse.&quot;

&quot;It amazes us too, sir,&quot; Fausta said. Amy laid Fleur down on a bench and 
offered to get her something, for which she sighed stuffily.

&quot;Just get some damned Tylenol, an ice pack, and a glass of water. I&#39;m 
fine.&quot;

&quot;Are y-you s-s-sure?&quot; Fleur nodded furiously and Amy was on her way. The 
young man visited her to apologize, but a single glare sent him 
scampering.

&quot;I really didn&#39;t mean to,&quot; he muttered, scratching his hair. He was a 
good-looking sweet young man, maybe a little too thin, but in great 
shape. He had his shirt off and his skin was glistening; Terra almost 
had a nosebleed when she first saw him, and even Fausta was impressed. 
He walked over to them with his student in tow, bowing apologetically.

&quot;I&#39;m real sorry about your friend. We didn&#39;t mean to get carried away. I 
was just caught off guard, and she&#39;s getting stronger.&quot;

&quot;No long-term harm done,&quot; Fausta said.

&quot;So are you two regulars?&quot; the girl asked. &quot;We&#39;re sort of new, so I 
guess we&#39;re not used to the place.&quot;

&quot;This one&#39;s the only veteran,&quot; Nazario said as she pointed to Terra. 
&quot;Her and the girl who caught our little princess.&quot;

&quot;Oh, cool. I&#39;m Dorian and this is Amika. We&#39;re visiting the area with 
our friends and thought we&#39;d take a look around. I, uh, hope you don&#39;t 
mind us crashing your dojo.&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Terra smiled. She introduced herself, Fausta, Amy, and 
Fleur. It turned out that Dorian was a fairly accomplished martial 
artist, and Amika was his friend and student. They both came to watch 
Anolis&#39;s practice game, along with a much larger group of friends. 
Nobody had the heart to tell them that they were on Carnegie&#39;s team; 
they felt it would ruin the newfound friendship. They practiced and 
chatted together, though Amika and Amy stayed out of most of the 
conversation, naturally gravitating towards exercise or else Fleur&#39;s 
needs.

&quot;She&#39;s a wonderful gymnast,&quot; Dorian remarked fondly. &quot;One day she&#39;ll be 
better than me.&quot;

&quot;Is she your girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Nah,&quot; he laughed humbly, &quot;just a good friend. She&#39;s got someone and so 
do I.&quot;

Rats, Terra grumbled.

&quot;So what do you guys do for fun?&quot;

&quot;I like video games and anime whenever I&#39;m not at the dojo.&quot;

&quot;I prefer real art, like opera and Thin Man films, as well as fashion 
and history.&quot;

&quot;Cool. And those two?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re not very...interactive,&quot; Fausta murmured. &quot;As far as I can 
tell, though, Amy&#39;s a nice girl, just not comfortable around people.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been there,&quot; he said somberly. &quot;And...uh, Fleur, was it? What 
about her?&quot; Fausta chuckled.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say she deserved that, but...&quot;

&quot;Come on now, it can&#39;t be that bad! Miss Amy seems to like her.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s just taking care of her. That was no lover&#39;s embrace you saw 
earlier. Come to think of it, I don&#39;t believe Fleur loves anybody, not 
even herself.&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot; Amika said. Fausta gave her a solemn, romantic smile.

&quot;Well...hmm, that&#39;s hard to say. It&#39;s not easy to get on my good side, 
but a few people here and there have figured out the trick. I guess you 
could say I only like people who have a definite goal in mind, and put 
forth all their energies into reaching it- and once they do, they work 
hard to keep it. People of great passion and intensity.&quot;

&quot;Like yourself, in other words,&quot; Terra pointed out. Fausta shrugged.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong in finding comfort in familiar territory.&quot;

&quot;So you two are basically like fire and ice,&quot; Dorian said, meaning 
Fausta and Fleur. She raised an eyebrow.

&quot;That&#39;s...one interpretation. But even an Ice Queen has a few redeemable 
traits. Fleur...I&#39;m not so sure of.&quot; Luckily, Miss Lacroix could not 
overhear their conversation: she was more concerned with her foot. Amy 
was giving up a lot of her time in caring for her, and she was actually 
a pretty decent nurse. Fleur was like an animal now, and Amy was good 
with animals.

&quot;Any b-better?&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s feeling fine now,&quot; she replied. &quot;The pills helped. You know, 
you&#39;re not so bad at this. Had any experience with broken ankles 
before?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, m-m-mostly on d-dogs and cats.&quot;

&quot;Oh? A karate veterinarian, eh?&quot;

&quot;It k-k-keeps me f-focused...and I alw-ways liked anim-m-mals.&quot;

&quot;It shows,&quot; she replied courteously. &quot;Of course, now I&#39;m definitely out 
of the game. Won&#39;t Leena be disappointed.&quot; Amy didn&#39;t catch the sarcasm 
and nodded.

&quot;Mm-hmm, it&#39;ll b-be difficult on Al-lice and Ar-r-rina. B-but you&#39;ll 
g-get well s-s-soon.&quot; Fleur smiled flatly, and decided to put Amy in the 
&quot;people I don&#39;t dislike&quot; category, which had a very sparse population 
and was normally difficult to get into.

 

- Lauren Ofdensen, Hobbies: baseball, Adult Swim, Utena; goalie/reserve-

 

Lauren was starting to wish her work schedule was a little more 
consistent. She hadn&#39;t bothered to shower in anticipation of spending 
several hours immersed in automobile humours, and instead, she was asked 
to be the receptionist for the day. So now here she was, a little smelly 
and a little dirty- not to mention a little bored- wishing she had known 
about this earlier. But her day wasn&#39;t completely without its perks. 
Jackie brought in some Krispy Kreme and gave her the crullers; she got 
to read, study, and watch TV so long as she didn&#39;t have a customer; and 
best of all, she got to look at all the pretty faces that came her way. 
The one that surprised her the most was Felicity&#39;s.

&quot;Hey!&quot; she grinned. &quot;Fancy running into you here, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, how coincidental I should meet a maintenance technician in a 
mechanic&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant, dipweed. So what&#39;s an upscale babe like you 
doing in a dump like this?&quot;

&quot;Just a standard checkup. I do it every six months whether it needs it 
or not.&quot; Lauren humbly shirked and shook her head.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not a gynecologist, but I&#39;ll see what I can do...&quot;

&quot;My car, Lauren! I just need some people to look at my car!!&quot;

&quot;Relax, Felicia,&quot; she sang. &quot;I&#39;m just shittin&#39; with ya. God! So what&#39;s 
the make and model?&quot;

&quot;A 2012 Honda Acura, cobalt blue. There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with 
it; I just like making sure of that.&quot;

&quot;Hmm, you take good care of your vehicle. Come on over here and fill out 
the paperwork. So whaddya think about the game, huh? Are we gonna win or 
what?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she murmured. Lauren made a meaningless gesture and 
leaned forward. Felicity had an enchanting scent that hinted at her 
upper-class status, something Lauren could never approach. In fact, the 
only way they were able to interact was due to the game. But that sort 
of thing never mattered to her: she hated the idea of a &quot;social barrier&quot; 
and thrived to leap over that wall as often as possible.

&quot;So you wanna hang out sometime? Not like a date, I mean, unless that&#39;s 
your thing. Just chill together.&quot;

&quot;No thanks. There, finished.&quot; Lauren wearily glanced at the document and 
pointed to a chair.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you park your kiester and chat? It&#39;s lonely and boring here.&quot;

&quot;I have other things to do.&quot;

&quot;So...what, you gonna walk there?&quot; she snorted. &quot;It&#39;ll take at least an 
hour for us to look it over- more if we find something wrong. Come on, 
sit down, relax! Tell me something about yourself.&quot;

&quot;No thanks. I don&#39;t live very far anyway.&quot;

&quot;Shit, girl, what&#39;s your hurry? You don&#39;t got work, unless you changed 
your schedule around, and it&#39;s too early to sleep. There&#39;s a Fazoli&#39;s 
nearby if you want supper, and if it&#39;s me, just come on out and say it. 
You got a hot date?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m just busy.&quot; Lauren rolled her eyes and decided to give up. If 
Felicity was going to be that way, fine.

&quot;All right, god! I&#39;m only trying to be nice here. I may not care about 
the game, but you all seem okay. I guess I&#39;ll stay outta your way from 
now on. God!&quot; Felicity turned around to leave, but had to wait for two 
more people to come through the door. Lauren&#39;s failure put her in a bad 
mood, and not even two pretty faces could cure her at once. She tried, 
though, bless her.

&quot;Hi, sorry to bother you. We&#39;re from out of state and our car&#39;s sort of 
in disrepair from the journey. Do you think you could, uh...see what&#39;s 
wrong with it?&quot;

&quot;Sure, no prob. You&#39;re not in any hurry, are you?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no. We&#39;re here for the soccer game.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Which one?&quot;

&quot;Carnegie and Anolis.&quot;

&quot;No way!&quot; Lauren grinned (abstaining from casual foul language in front 
of strangers). &quot;You hear that, Felicity? We finally got fans!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re probably here for Anolis.&quot; She smiled dryly at them. They were 
older women- not quite Leena&#39;s age, but certainly close. &quot;Are you 
alums?&quot;

&quot;We actually work for the university,&quot; said the eldest. According to the 
paperwork they filled out, her name was Zafe; her companion was Salin, 
and since the two were not relatives, Lauren thought...well, it wasn&#39;t 
anything entirely wholesome, I can guarantee that. &quot;We&#39;re sort of bound 
by employee standards to attend.&quot;

&quot;You mean you have to go?&quot;

&quot;Uh, more or less,&quot; Zafe smiled. &quot;Are you two students?&quot;

&quot;Yes. We&#39;re sort of obliged to attend as well.&quot;

&quot;Ah. Has Carnegie been around very long? I&#39;ve never even heard of it, 
let alone it had a team.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a real small school, and it&#39;s pretty new,&quot; Lauren said. &quot;I think 
they&#39;ve only been around for three years, but they teach a whole bunch 
of unique classes. The team actually got started early this month.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re that new?&quot; Salin said. &quot;Why in the world is a beginner team 
being asked to practice with us? It doesn&#39;t sound fair.&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean, lady. Our esteemed Chairman made the call. He 
made some retarded bet with the Dean. Nothing good can come from it.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should have words with this man,&quot; Salin murmured. Lauren could 
already tell that these were good people, not like her. They were 
looking out for the team and cared more for its well-being than she did. 
She decided to slip them an employee discount.

&quot;The game&#39;s today, and they can&#39;t back out now,&quot; Felicity reasoned.

&quot;Yes, but- don&#39;t take this the wrong way- it&#39;s a bad idea to send an 
inexperienced team against Anolis. There&#39;s nothing sporting about it.&quot;

&quot;The Chairman did it on purpose,&quot; Lauren grumbled. &quot;He doesn&#39;t want us 
to win.&quot;

&quot;And your Headmaster agreed?&quot;

&quot;Apparently she thought it would be good for us to play a challenging 
team.&quot;

&quot;A challenge I can understand, but...&quot; Zafe cut herself off before she 
could say anything rude, not that it bothered Lauren or Felicity. One 
was used to more cutting barbs; the other barely cared at all. &quot;Anyway, 
thanks for listening to our opinions.&quot;

&quot;No, thank you for humoring us,&quot; Lauren grinned. &quot;You seem like pretty 
cool people. It&#39;s too bad our two schools have to be enemies right now.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Salin proclaimed dramatically, &quot;if only we had met under 
different circumstances, we could have been friends!!&quot; She laughed and 
asked their names. Lauren then eyed Felicity suspiciously: she had stuck 
around long after saying she would leave.

&quot;I thought you were busy, Felicia. What happened to that?&quot;

&quot;I...I just got distracted,&quot; she muttered, gathering her belongings and 
trying to hide her red face. She desperately yearned for human contact 
but couldn&#39;t afford any distractions now, not before the big game. 
Practice or not, it mattered to her: she was determined to prove herself 
even if she had to be cut away from all humanity. Lauren shouted that 
she would call Felicity about her car, then sighed and turned her focus 
to Zafe and Salin.

&quot;You two wanna hang out with me? I&#39;m so bored, I&#39;m about ready to read 
the store magazines.&quot;

&quot;How much time did you say it&#39;d take?&quot; Lauren shrugged.

&quot;Usually about an hour to figure out what&#39;s wrong. After that, who 
knows.&quot;

&quot;I saw a Fazoli&#39;s not too far away,&quot; Salin said. &quot;I could grab some 
lunch and we could eat it here.&quot;

&quot;Aw, sweet! You&#39;d seriously do that?&quot; The older woman smiled and Lauren 
clapped for joy. Zafe smiled warmly as she got their orders and left. 
Lauren was still stricken and shook her head in amazement. It took a lot 
to impress her. &quot;Dude, I gotta say, that&#39;s one awesome lady. Please tell 
me she&#39;s single.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Zafe laughed. &quot;But she&#39;s with a good person- and me too, before 
you get any ideas.&quot;

&quot;Hey, a girl&#39;s gotta try, right?&quot;

 

- Terra Tu, Hobbies: comics, anime, RPGs, Tae Kwon Do; left back-

 

After taking a few extra hours to rest and prepare themselves, 
Carnegie&#39;s fledgling soccer team returned to their &quot;holy ground&quot; for one 
last pep talk from the Coach. Nerves were frayed, stomachs churned, 
pulses soared, palms perspired, and prayers were muttered. Unlike 
Laudendale, which had been an equal match for them, Anolis played at the 
national level and was reputed to be one of the best. Even veterans like 
Shannon, Fausta, Felicity, and Kasumi understood their talent, and if 
they weren&#39;t certain of their victory...

&quot;Come on, everyone, there&#39;s no reason for us to give up now!&quot; Maria and 
Shiki were standing before them in lieu of their mistress, who was still 
more or less bound to a wheelchair. &quot;We may be up against a superior 
opponent, but that&#39;s no excuse to play sloppy! Give them an inch and 
they&#39;ll walk all over us!&quot;

&quot;Our best bet would be to take advantage of their assumptions toward 
us,&quot; Arina murmured thoughtfully. &quot;From what I&#39;ve gathered, Anolis 
believes we&#39;re inferior and inexperienced. If we can blitz them in the 
opening minutes, we&#39;ll have an excellent chance to score, but we have to 
play like we mean it. After that, it&#39;s a matter of attrition.&quot;

&quot;And our ability to catch their power drives,&quot; Valencia said, nervously 
ribbing Lauren.

&quot;I know you&#39;ll all do fine,&quot; Leena said. &quot;You may be inexperienced, but 
you still have your strengths. Just don&#39;t get carried away and think the 
fate of the world rests on this match. We still have one game left if we 
don&#39;t do well, so let&#39;s not beat ourselves up.&quot;

&quot;Too bad I can&#39;t help,&quot; Fleur sighed, sounding anything but remorseful. 
Amy still gave her the benefit of the doubt, even if nobody else did.

&quot;Y-you&#39;ll get b-better s-s-soon. J-just take care of th-th-that f-foot. 
W-wish us l-l-luck.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; she said dismissively. The team took a deep collective 
breath and walked out of the locker room, but Fleur clung onto Amy&#39;s arm 
and pulled her back. She kissed her quickly on the mouth and smirked. 
&quot;Extra luck for you.&quot;

&quot;Th...thanks,&quot; Amy whispered. She felt like her whole body had turned 
red as she followed her teammates. Maria and Shiki helped carry Fleur to 
the bench, where she was asked to help Kathlyn with staff duties. The 
team saw two remarkable sights awaiting them on the field. One was 
Freya, beautiful and golden, gingerly standing out of her wheelchair and 
waving a Carnegie pennant. The other was their opponents.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; Jen whispered.

&quot;Sonuva bitch,&quot; Shannon hissed.

&quot;Aw, shit,&quot; Kasumi groaned.

&quot;This certainly complicates things,&quot; Fausta murmured. Tamarit, Ashandra, 
Voirrey, Lothella, and Amika were stretching on the field as Zafe and 
Salin gave them some final directions.

&quot;They&#39;re on the team?!&quot; Elisa squealed.

&quot;They&#39;re on the team?!&quot; Dorian gawked.

&quot;What a revolting development,&quot; Lauren sighed.
