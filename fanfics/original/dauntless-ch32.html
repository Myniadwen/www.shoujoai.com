<body>
<p>There is no night  and day in space, only meaningless time and clocks kept around to  observe the immeasurable hours. Out of a lifelong adherence to the  rituals of slumber, most of the crew chose the later hours to rest,  but many were just as free to sleep during the “day”, while  others crashed at random intervals, never knowing when they might be  jolted awake or knocked out. The majority of the crew was in their  rooms, snoozing or getting ready to, and the ship was relatively  quiet: the Space Race and the events following it had tuckered  everybody out. The Acheron twins had put the <em>Dauntless</em> on autopilot, choosing a long, barren course to coast their vessel  through until they woke up or somebody chose to assume control  (usually someone assertive, like Naja or Aseria). Things were  generally at peace for the moment. Nothing was going on and the crew  was glad to have it that way.</p>
<p>Rachel the Ifritah  was the only person onboard who did not require sleep, and while she  did take rests, it was more of an action she performed than a  necessity: it was like cooking, or climbing stairs for her. She was  removed from her activity by a strange force, as if a fellow  macro-organism was tugging her skin. She sat up refreshed, flew down  from Amy’s ceiling, and hovered in the air as she meditated on this  development. What happened next was odd, but you must remember that  this is a Jinniyah, and they as unstable and unpredictable as all the  legends claim.</p>
<p>She shouted out  loud—not in a particularly painful voice, for Amy was jolted and  not deafened—waking the entire crew, regardless of their nocturnal  condition. No degree of chaos or order could protect anyone as  Rachel inhaled sharply, threw her limbs out, lit up with white fire,  and painlessly removed every living creature from the <em>Dauntless</em> as it floated through the depths of the heavens. The unusual effects  of this freak occurrence knocked everyone unconscious.</p>
<p>Aseria Tolan was  the first to wake from the darkness. She felt groggy and  lightheaded, and was sporting a mild headache, but she usually felt  that way after coming out of slumber, especially if her night had  been wild. She wasn’t injured, which seemed remarkable after  everything she had been put through, but she was also no longer  aboard the <em>Dauntless</em>. The ground beneath her was flat, dry, dusty, and barren, and she  jumped with a start as it dawned on her that she had been thrust onto  an alien world. As she squinted in the midday sun, she noticed she  was not the only victim of Rachel’s mischief: Allegra had been  thrown here with her, and she was beginning to wake as well. But  that was the extent of her blessings. Aside from this charming,  mysterious woman who was a virtual stranger to her, Aseria had no  other company: indeed, not a soul could be seen for miles. She  realized, with a sinking stomach, that she was lost on a strange  world, and would have to survive in the wilderness until her  companions came to find her.</p>
<p><strong>Voyage of the  “Dauntless”</strong></p>
<p>VOLUME FIVE: IN  SEARCH OF FRIENDS</p>
<p>“Separated and  Lost on a Strange World: oh no!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well I’ll be  hornswaggled,” Allegra sighed as Aseria explained what had  happened—or at least what she could gather. According to her  testimony, Rachel must’ve suddenly gone berserk, and the  uncontrollable surge of power that shot out of her being sent the  crew plummeting into this strange world. Aseria had scouted the  horizon while Allegra came to, but found nothing save a desolate,  lonely savanna, though there was plenty of evidence that life could  exist on this world, if it couldn’t thrive. Tough, thistly bushes  were grouped in uneven clusters, and scraggly trees broke through the  flat land to provide distant shade and fruit. Allegra’s eyes could  only see so far, but Aseria spotted a mountain in the far distance,  and she also noticed a herd of animals galloping several kilometers  away. It was still and dull in the immediate vicinity, though, and  not even Aseria could sense her allies, not even when she attempted  to call forth Sindarin magic.</p>
<p>“It  certainly  beats the desert,” Allegra commented, taking a moment to observe  her feral surroundings. “It’s not half-bad out here, y’know. I could do  for a nice drink and a bath, but all things considered, we  got off lucky.”</p>
<p>“Do you really  call this situation ‘lucky’?” Aseria asked bitterly. “We’re  lost on an alien world, there’s no sign of our friends, there’s  no food or water anywhere, we’re exposed to the elements out here  in the open, there’s probably a hundred savage animals roaming  around, Iluvatar only <em>knows</em> which planet we’ve been sent to, and—before I forget—our ship  may be on the other side of the universe for all we know! How can  you call this ‘lucky’?!”</p>
<p>“Because we ain’t  dead, that’s why,” Allegra huffed, backing down from the  infuriated elf. “And if you’d just hold your horses, I could  prob’ly fix half o’ those worries in a jiff. Land sakes, you  sure are uppity for an elf! I thought all you people were in touch  with nature or something.”</p>
<p>“Nature and a  civilization that forms a symbiotic, respectful relationship with  it,” she corrected stiffly. She gestured towards the veldt and  turned purple with anger. “But <em>this</em> isn’t nature or civilization! It’s just a lot of dead nothing as  far as the eye can see! And to make things worse, as far as I know,  we might be the only people on this whole planet! Our friends—“</p>
<p>“If that’s so,  then we’re definitely in luck,” Allegra replied enthusiastically. “That means they’re either back at the <em>Dauntless</em>,  scratchin’ their heads and wonderin’ what happened to us, or  they’ve been thrown to a world where they can find a spaceport. Lord have mercy, woman, if you’d just stop fussin’ for two  seconds, you’d be a much happier person!”</p>
<p>“This coming from  the brooding gunslinger.”</p>
<p>“I  don’t have  time to brood now,” Allegra replied as she searched her person.  Spending several years as a drifter on Earth gave rise to several  practices that were now coming in handy: she had carried a knapsack  with her when she went to bed, out of habit, and now that sack was  still with her, along with her trademark Whitworth rifle and enough  ammunition to last for half a month. She completely emptied it and  separated the items into categories, muttering to herself as Aseria  watched keenly. Among Allegra’s belongings were a flint and  tinder, a compass, a pocket-watch, a hammer and nails, a hatchet, a  Swiss army knife, a few flares, binoculars, a compact mirror, a  skillet and fork, a blanket, some rations, and equipment to extract  juice from cacti. Aseria didn’t want to admit it, but she was  impressed.</p>
<p>“Looks like we’re  in business!” exclaimed the gunslinger. She split one of her  ration bars in half and gave a piece to Aseria. “We’d better eat  now, since there’s no telling when we’ll have the chance.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,”  she murmured. The bar was tasteless but fulfilling, not unlike  Sindarin waybread. “You’re right. Our first course of action  should be to find some food, and water to go </p>
<p>with it.”</p>
<p>“Look for fruits  first,” Allegra instructed. “The juice’ll hold us if we can’t  find water right away. I can cook just about anything, and I’ve  got my gun for huntin’. I’m really more worried about findin’  the others, if any of em’ came with us.”</p>
<p>“You should leave  that part to me,” Aseria stated quietly as she sat back down. She  didn’t like the state of affairs she was in, or even the company,  but she could adjust, given the situation. She would just have to  force herself to get along with Allegra until they could get some  help. After finding a suitable place to recline, Aseria arched her  head back, unbuttoned her shirt, and cast it aside, exposing her  beautiful black skin. Allegra stared questionably as she also  removed a white choker Lillianne had given her, and the brassiere  that concealed her bosom. She blushed modestly and focused on her  work, but couldn’t help asking questions.</p>
<p>“Um, pardon me  for askin’ a potentially stupid question, but what in Sam Hill are  you doing? I hope you aren’t thinkin’ of gettin’ a <em>tan</em>,  especially with your complexion!”</p>
<p>“No, of course  not, don’t be ridiculous,” she stated sharply. Aseria was now  unfastening her ceremonial belt, and wriggled out of her dress like a  snake shedding its skin. Her stockings and shoes came off next,  exposing twelve cute toes (all elves have one more digit than humans  do, including Lyara), and soon there was nothing left but her  panties, which followed suit after a bit of struggle. Sweat was  trickling down Aseria’s obsidian body, but fear of overheating  wasn’t the reason why she had stripped down.</p>
<p>“I need to absorb  the sun’s energy in order to perform the correct spells,” she  explained, giving Allegra a professional stare. “Tell me, how much  do you know about magic?”</p>
<p>“Just what I saw  at the carnival.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll try  and make this lesson easy to digest. Elves such as the Valar and the  Sindar—that is, the races that Lyara and I belong to—can control  the Arcanum to their will, providing they have a sufficient external  and internal source. In other words, if I wanted to cast a spell to  guide our friends to our location, which is what I’m preparing for,  I would have two basic options in terms of drawing the necessary  energy: I could either use my own life-force, which would be a bad  idea in our situation, or I could borrow some from the elements and  infuse myself with it. Since I’ve deduced that the best way to  attract our comrades would be to cast several large light spells at  intervals of, say, every hour or so, I’m going to need to infuse  myself with the sun’s light. Does that make sense?”</p>
<p>“Sorta,”  Allegra paled. “So what you’re saying is that you’re kinda  like a solar-powered magician, right?”</p>
<p>“No, you  misinterpreted my meaning. Casting a water spell would be easy,  since my body’s composition is mostly water anyway, but casting  several consecutively would mean I would have to infuse myself with  that element—like bathing or drinking. Starting a little fire  would also be simple, since I could just use my own body heat, but  producing a massive blaze would mean…well, ‘befriending’ Kyrie  Lastgear. Oh, don’t give me that look; it’s very simple once you  understand. If you’re uncomfortable with my body, I promise I’ll  get dressed around dusk.”</p>
<p>“Not like I’ve  never seen a naked woman before,” she muttered. “Although I will  admit, that color of yours is unusual. I mean, not that it’s bad  or nothin’—shoot, I think you and Sharyn both look mighty fine. Anyway, I’m babblin’, and I’m also hungry. I’ll get a fire  going soon, then I’ll go out and hunt. Can I trust you to stay  here and keep watch over my things?” Aseria raised a thin, pale  sapphire eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I don’t have  to be still to absorb the sunlight, if that’s what you mean—or is  it that you </p>
<p>don’t trust me? I’m not a thief, Allegra.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean  it like that, either!” she insisted. “I’m just worried that if  we leave this place unattended, we’ll never find it again, and I  can’t lug all this stuff around while I’m huntin’.”</p>
<p>“Point taken,”  Aseria smiled. “I’ll stay here and keep watch over things. Here, take the watch with you at least, and come back here in two  hours. If I don’t see you, I’ll throw a little light in the air,  and if I still don’t see you, I’ll probably have to avenge you.” Allegra grinned and slapped Aseria’s naked shoulder.</p>
<p>“Aw, shoot,  that’s mighty sweet of ya, but don’t you underestimate me! Remember, you were mouthin’ off like a lil’ city girl when we  first got here! It’s <em>you</em> that might need avenging.”</p>
<p>“I’m not as  delicate as I look,” she vowed. The two women smiled at each other  one more time before Allegra wandered off, hoping that they could  ride this trial through safely.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Allegra van  Landingham had plenty of time to think as she wandered around in  search of game. Back home on Earth, she was usually trapped by her  own thoughts as she drifted from town to town, trying to stay one  step ahead of the law—the prey escaping predators, now turned  predator herself. Back then, she had no choice about her lifestyle;  it was the same here as well. She didn’t know why she wanted to  live so badly—everything she ever loved had been taken away from  her—she just knew that deep down, the thirst for life had taken  control, and for good or ill, she would devote herself to seeing  where this path would take her. Allegra briefly broke out of her  inner diatribe as she noticed a group of roebucks grazing in the  distance, and set her rights on a small one, adding a silencer so she  wouldn’t attract the wrong kind of attention.</p>
<p>These  animals had  never come into contact with guns before, so when one of them fell,  the others jerked to attention and perked their ears up. They  couldn’t see, hear, or smell any predators, and seeing their  brethren perish so suddenly puzzled them. They decided to make a  break for it, leaving Allegra’s prize behind as they galloped away.  Lady van Landingham approached the dead roebuck carefully, placed  her hand on its neck, and caressed its fur thoughtfully before  lifting it. Despite its petite size, the animal was brutally heavy,  and Allegra was forced to rest every few minutes as she carried it on  her shoulders. For awhile, she focused on returning to camp, hoping  that she could find her way back. She didn’t really trust Aseria,  but she didn’t think the dark-skinned elf would leave her behind,  either. It was a very odd relationship.</p>
<p>Thoughts of her  family crept into her mind as she settled down for a longer reprieve.  Allegra had never spoken of them to anyone; it was emotionally  difficult for her to pull those memories out. She preferred acting  cheerful and sophisticated, sometimes even a little reckless; it was  better than succumbing to the aching loneliness and depraved insanity  again. Part of the reason she was forced into the life of a wanderer  was <em>because</em> she had fallen into that dark pit of despair; she closed her eyes and  shed tears of frustration and sorrow as the ghosts of the men she had  killed during that bleak period came back to haunt her. This was her  curse: she was condemned to remember them for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>“Welp, time to  move on!” she exclaimed shakily, picking herself up and slinging  the roebuck over her shoulders again. Staying on the move helped  diminish the nightmares and kept </p>
<p>her mind steady. She tried thinking about what she was going to do when she got back  to camp, how she was going to cook this thing, what Aseria would  say—whether she was still naked or not—and wondered how effective  that magic of hers was. But inevitably, her thoughts also wandered  to the man she had loved, the children she had conceived with him,  the horror of his death, and the frightening person she became  shortly after. She also thought about Kate—that strong, sweet, shy  woman who shared a similarly grim history. Just by looking into her  eyes, Allegra could tell that this was a kindred spirit—this was a  woman who could identify with her, and share sympathy with her—and  wished she had been stuck with her instead of Aseria.</p>
<p>“I could probably  count on Kate to rescue me,” she muttered as the strain of the  roebuck dragged her down. She set her trophy on the ground, took a  breather, and smiled with relief as she saw the outline of the camp,  the smoke from the fire she had started, and a beautiful,  bare-skinned elf glowing with an ethereal radiance.</p>
<p>“Hey, naked girl! Get that rear end of yours over here and help me haul in supper! I  swear, you’ve got some nerve takin’ a nap while I’ve been  bustin’ my back!”</p>
<p>“So how’s your  magic comin’ along?”</p>
<p>“I should be  ready to open myself to the Arcanum fairly soon. You know, you’re  a pretty good cook.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. Eat as  much as you want: we’ve got plenty of food now, but it’ll spoil  quickly. Uh, say, you wouldn’t happen to have the ability to magic  up some water, would you?”</p>
<p>“You’re  thinking  of your circus magicians again,” Aseria pointed sharply. “There’s a  world of difference between their childish tricks and  the Craft of the Arcanum. It’s like comparing a child’s crayon  drawing to a masterpiece.”</p>
<p>“Awright, I get  the idea,” she pouted. “You don’t have to rub it in. I’m  just saying that we’ll be gettin’ thirsty shortly.”</p>
<p>“That will not be  a problem,” Aseria said quietly. During the meal, she couldn’t  help but notice how similar their manners were, and was impressed  that someone like Allegra could stay dainty and ladylike with a messy  meal like this. The Empress herself would be hard-pressed to surpass  van Landingham as she picked at the meat with perfect elegance and  civility. Aseria smiled and resumed eating, savoring every bite as  if it would be her last.</p>
<p>“So you found  some water?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a stream  not too far away. I took a walk while you were out hunting and came  across it by chance. I also found a small pond we could use as a  bath.”</p>
<p>“I hope it ain’t  filled with frogs and algae,” Allegra grumbled. Aseria laughed.</p>
<p>“Not algae, at  least. There were a few dragonflies and fish, too. Don’t be so  finicky.”</p>
<p>“I don’t like  frogs,” she stated. Aseria laughed and threw her bones away. No  doubt that scavengers and flies would be crowding the campsite  shortly, since they couldn’t take the rest of their dinner with  them, so they would have to find a new encampment.</p>
<p>“Do you mind  sharing a bath with an elvish princess at least?”</p>
<p>“I can’t see  the harm in it,” Allegra answered quietly. “I’ve shared that  sauna with some of the others.”</p>
<p>“All right. We  should probably walk there. I don’t want to get in the water while  I’m still digesting. It’s only two kilometers in that  direction.” Allegra peered into the distance and saw a blurry  green spot resting on the horizon. She couldn’t figure out what it  was, so she just had to take Aseria for her word. She packed as much  meat as she could, and together the two </p>
<p>women headed out.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Since Aseria was  still naked, and apparently comfortable walking in that state, she  merely stepped into the pond without pause. Allegra, who always  prided herself on her modesty, was much more timid as she took her  clothes off and jumped in. Of course, this only helped draw more  attention to her, and Aseria caught herself admiring the lady’s  figure. She certainly had a graceful body, but it was also fit and  lean, and her hands and feet were politely calloused from years of  handling firearms and wandering from town to town. Her skin glowed  tan, cheeks flushing as she distanced herself from the elf. Aseria  smiled to herself and wondered if it would ever be possible to seduce  this prude. She turned around to expose her naked back and tied her  long cerulean hair up, unveiling her shoulders and nape.</p>
<p>“Be a dear and  wash my back, please. I’m afraid I can’t reach.”</p>
<p>“Uh, I ain’t  got no sponge or nothin’.” Aseria giggled.</p>
<p>“That’s  okay,  just use your bare hands. I’ll count it as a massage.” Aseria  wanted to see how embarrassed that statement made her companion, but  she left it up to her imagination instead, and waited patiently.  Allegra certainly turned red—she had never given massages before,  least of all to another woman—and she struggled over the  implications. She didn’t know much about Lady Tolan, but she did  know that this woman was hardly innocent. “What’s wrong?” she  called as Allegra hesitated. “Do I intimidate you? Perhaps I  should wash you first to break the ice.”</p>
<p>“Um, I dunno  about that…”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” she  chirped as she turned around. Allegra made a face and looked away;  her companion giggled seductively, waded towards her, and made a  circling gesture with her finger, indicating that van Landingham  should turn around. “Unless you want me to wash those beautiful  breasts of yours first.”</p>
<p>“Um, no, that’s  okay, I can handle those! I mean, if you’re set on doing <em>something</em>,  ya may as well wash where I can’t reach! B-but no funny business,  okay? I’m not that type of lady.”</p>
<p>“Oh, what a  pity,” she sighed as she massaged Allegra’s bare back. Aseria  thought this was the sexiest part of a woman’s body, and made no  effort to hide her lust whenever she made love to her sister or  Lillianne. She was incredibly tempted to kiss Allegra’s shoulders,  reach around to graze her breasts, bend down to caress her bottom,  and slide her fingers over her enticing womanhood, but miraculously  restrained herself.</p>
<p>“Making love to  another woman is such a beautiful, exciting experience, especially if  it’s someone you trust--or someone really sexy!! You should try  it sometime!”</p>
<p>“No thanks,”  Allegra barked. “I’m finished with love! I just wanna spend the  rest of my life doing good.”</p>
<p>“That sounds  noble, but depressing,” she hissed erotically. “Why not try  sharing your heart with someone? Your life could be so much more  fulfilling.” Allegra pushed the dark-skinned elf away and sulked.</p>
<p>“Even if I wanted  to, I could never find someone nice enough to take me in. My  hands’re too dirty to hold anyone. I wouldn’t fall in love with  a woman, anyway.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Why not? What  if you met the right one? Why should you let something like gender  keep you from opening your heart? If a man and a woman have the  exact same qualities, why should you discriminate between them?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s  immoral and disgusting, that’s why! I mean…” She hugged  herself coldly and sunk into the water, shaking with doubt. “I  didn’t mean it to sound like that. I’m not a homophobe, Aseria;  I just don’t think it’s right for me. Hell, I don’t know what  I’m saying. I’m just not cut out for love. And while we’re on  the subject, how in Sam Hill did you meet up with an ornery woman  like Lil?” Aseria’s seductive aura mellowed slowly, until all  that was left was a faint, warm glow—not quite love, but just as  deep and disturbing.</p>
<p>“I found her,”  she answered vaguely. Allegra made a face.</p>
<p>“You <em>found</em> her?”</p>
<p>“Yes. She needed  someone to rescue her, and I was there to save her. Somehow, it  seemed like destiny. I really can’t explain it any better.”</p>
<p>“I don’t  believe in that nonsense,” she scoffed. “So if you love her so  much, why’re you flirtin’ with me?”</p>
<p>“I’m not in  love with Lillianne,” Aseria whispered eerily. “She’s just  important to me. We have a bond—a connection. Ours is a free  relationship. Well, she seems to think <em>she’s</em> free, in any case. She behaves like a slut, but expects me to be  faithful only to her. If she saw me making a pass at you, why…she’d  rip you apart!”</p>
<p>“Possessive  much?” Allegra grimaced. Aseria nodded forlornly.</p>
<p>“I wish that  selfish Mun would just let me make love to somebody else. Aria and  Naja are great, but my heart isn’t trapped in a cage. You know, we  could—“</p>
<p>“Nope, outta the  question! Not even if I <em>was</em> a dyke!”</p>
<p>“What’s a  dyke?” she asked innocently. Allegra cringed and told her to never  mind. She later relented and washed Aseria’s back, and there was  no effort on the elf’s part to make it anything other than a  friendly gesture.</p>
<p>As night fell, she  got dressed and started casting light spells, sending brilliant  flares into the inky sky every hour until sleep overcame her. Allegra strengthened their fire, then laid next to her companion,  pulling her blanket over them both so they wouldn’t freeze. She  probably would never be Aseria’s friend, but for the time being,  she had to keep and care for this woman, because she was the only  thing standing between sanity and oblivion. Before surrendering to  the night, Allegra wondered if she could bring herself to fall in  love again—or if anybody could love her in return.</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of  next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Aseria: Hey  Allegra, since Naja and Lil aren’t here, what say you and I have  some HLS to pass the time?</p>
<p>Allegra: BWUH? Please tell me you’re jokin’, hon!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aseria: No, I’m  serious! You may pretend to be a lady, but I know you’re really  wild, and I bet you’re curious, too! Don’t be afraid; it’s  actually very pleasurable!</p>
<p>Allegra: wails  Get me outta here!</p>
<p>Aseria: giggles I  never noticed how cute your bum was! Come on, let’s do the  horizontal tango!</p>
<p>Allegra: In the  next chapter, I spend so much time tryin’ to get away from this  horny toad that we ain’t even mentioned! Who else is trying to  survive in this harsh world? Find out in “The Flawed Couple: someone please come to rescue us!”</p>
<p>Aseria: GRAB!  Whee, you’re mine now! purr</p>
<p>Allegra: whines  Where’s a crowbar when ya need one?</p>
