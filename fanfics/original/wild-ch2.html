<a href="../original/wild-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Their picnic lunch by the waterfall ended all too soon
for Carmen Henderson, the redhead finishing up her
bowl of salad with reluctance. Across from her Diana
seemed equally unwilling for the meeting to end, the
glossy black haired woman gracefully plucking sliced
bits of tomato from her salad and eating them.

&quot;I never get over how beautiful it is out here,&quot;
Carmen murmured as she looked away from Diana&#39;s hazel
eyes, &quot;and I miss it when I stay away too long.&quot;

Diana smiled slightly, &quot;You come out here often,
then?&quot;

&quot;Whenever I can,&quot; Carmen said ruefully as she looked
out past the waterfall at the glowing sun... a sun
that was falling alarmingly towards the horizon. &quot;I&#39;m
sorry,&quot; she sighed as she began to pack up the food,
&quot;I think I&#39;d better start getting back to my camp,
it&#39;s going to be dark soon.&quot;

Diana put the slid on her salad, then gathered
together some of the other containers to hand to
Carmen. &quot;I&#39;ll follow you back,&quot; she offered as Carmen
efficiently packed, &quot;it isn&#39;t safe to be walking out
in the woods after dark.&quot;

Oddly feeling a sudden need to stand up for herself,
Carmen said wryly, &quot;I have done this before, you
know.&quot;

Diana just smiled, seemingly unoffended, &quot;And normally
I wouldn&#39;t be worried, but...&quot; She hesitated, almost
as if she didn&#39;t want to say it and then continued,
&quot;Something has stirred up the local wolves, as you
saw.&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; Carmen said quietly, thinking of the
wolf she had seen earlier that day.

&quot;Most of the time,&quot; Diana surprised her by picking up
the backpack and slinging it over her shoulder, &quot;a
wolf wouldn&#39;t bother you, but something has riled them
up... I&#39;m finding it hard to guess what they&#39;ll do.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Carmen smiled as she tried to grab her
pack, &quot;but you don&#39;t have to...&quot;

Diana set off at a brisk pace, Carmen hurrying to
catch up. &quot;I still owe you for yesterday&#39;s and today&#39;s
lunch,&quot; Diana said cheerfully as they headed down the
trail in the evening sun, &quot;consider this a first
installment.&quot;

&quot;If I get this kind of service from giving some
lunches,&quot; Carmen chuckled as she trotted along behind
her, &quot;what will I get for giving you dinner?&quot;

Diana looked back at her with sparkling eyes, &quot;You&#39;ll
just have to try that and find out.&quot;

&quot;Oh ho,&quot; Carmen laughed.

Diana turned to offer her hand as they clambered over
a fallen tree trunk, firmly helping tug Carmen over
without making her lose her balance. &quot;There&#39;s some
loose earth,&quot; she cautioned as her hand lingered in
Carmen&#39;s

Carmen smiled in gratitude, &quot;Thanks.&quot; Holding Diana&#39;s
hand she looked into those hazel eyes and felt her
heart skip a beat as she realized exactly why she had
been joking with her so much. &#39;She&#39;s beautiful,&#39; she
realized, &#39;and I&#39; attracted to her.&#39;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Diana asked, noticing Carmen&#39;s
faintly stunned look.

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Carmen answered, a faint blush coloring
her cheeks.

To Carmen&#39;s great disappointment Diana finally let go
of her hand as she said, &quot;The sunset is nearly here,
it&#39;ll be dark soon.&quot;

All around them the setting sun tinted the trees a
gorgeous looking red, the shadows long all around
them. &quot;It&#39;s a good hour yet from camp,&quot; Carmen said as
they continued on, &quot;I guess I should have been
watching the clock more.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for keeping you so long,&quot; Diana looked at
her apologetically.

Carmen smiled back reassuringly, &quot;It was worth it.&quot;

Diana seemed to search her eyes for some hidden
meaning then smiled, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

They walked on as the sunlight fully faded away, the
bright glow of the day being replaced by twilight.
Diana led the way, picking her way along the path with
a remarkable show of skill, her hazel eyes seemingly
able to pick out fine details in the growing darkness.

&quot;Did you hear that?&quot; Carmen asked, the soft sound in
the distance causing her to tense.

Diana stood oddly still, her long black hair gently
stirred be the breeze, then quietly she swore.
&quot;They&#39;re coming,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;What?&quot; Carmen blurted, feeling a sudden increase in
tension.

The night that had seemed so pleasant before was now
becoming frightening, the inky darkness concealing so
much from her eyes. There was the sound of breaking
branches, a few barks then off in the distance.. then
a wolf howled.

&quot;You have got to be kidding me,&quot; Carmen said weakly,
feeling a moment of dread.

&quot;Stay behind me,&quot; Diana ordered her softly, even as
the gray furred shapes slid from the darkness up the
trail. There were three wolves, the alpha female from
before and two others, smaller but clearly powerful,
all growling softly.

&quot;We&#39;ve got to run...,&quot; Carmen managed to weakly say.

&quot;No!&quot; Diana raised her voice slightly, the wolves
watching them warily as they began to circle. &quot;That
would just trigger their instinct to chase you,&quot; she
said quietly, &quot;and there&#39;s no way you could beat
them.&quot;

Before Carmen could try to form a reply the smallest
of the three wolves grew restless and charged, body
flowing across the uneven ground towards them. Carmen
jerked backward, her voice soft as she tried to make
herself smaller....

...then Diana moved.

With an almost inhuman speed she put herself squarely
in the path of the wolf, growling low in her throat.
It clearly wasn&#39;t expecting something like that and it
jerked to a stop, making a soft questioning noise.
Remarkably she barked, her voice crisp in the night
air, then made other wolf-like noises in the back of
her throat.

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; Carmen whispered, watching in some awe as
the woman held a barking conversation with the young
wolf. &#39;She said she was studying wolves but I never
expected this,&#39; she thought, biting back a hysterical
laugh.

&quot;Don&#39;t move,&quot; Diana asked Carmen as she walked towards
the alpha wolf.

Carmen whimpered softly as the younger wolves all
backed off a bit, but still staying close enough to
keep an eye on her. Silently Diana approached the pack
leader and knelt, her hazel eyes meeting that of the
wolf, and an deep yet unspoken communication seemed to
pass between them.

The alpha stood still, then her form seemed to blur
for a moment before a older woman stood where it once
was. Her long black hair was tangled, her body nude as
she stood in the moon light, looking at Diana
thoughtfully. &quot;This one is yours?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;Yes mother, she is,&quot; Diana had a gentle respect in
her voice, her head bent submissively. A pause and in
a much more annoyed voice she added, &quot;What did I tell
you about hunting humans, mother? You know it causes
nothing but trouble.&quot;

The woman looked sullen as she complained, &quot;But in
such a place as this, they would never find the
remains.&quot;

&quot;Yes they would,&quot; Diana looked like she had a headache
as she rubbed between her eyes, &quot;just take my word for
it, mother.&quot;

The other woman turned, walking to where the other two
wolves had retreated once they knew they weren&#39;t
eating anything here. &quot;All right,&quot; she said, &quot;I will
leave this one be, little wolf.&quot; With that she shifted
again and three wolves bounded off into the darkness.

&quot;You&#39;re a werewolf?!&quot; Carmen squeaked.

Diana looked at her with a wry smile, &quot;Sorry, no.&quot;

&quot;Eh?!&quot; Carmen asked as her train of thought derailed.

&quot;My mother is a were,&quot; Diana explained as she walked
over, steadying Carmen with a gentle touch, &quot;I was
born human. She took care of me until it became clear
I couldn&#39;t change, then made her way to a human city
and dropped me off at a orphanage.&quot;

Carmen looked at her blankly a moment, swayed
slightly... then fell over in a dead faint.

Smoothly Diana caught her, hoisting the stunned young
woman in her arms. &quot;I do this to all the girls,&quot; Diana
sighed, starting off on the final push to the camp.
