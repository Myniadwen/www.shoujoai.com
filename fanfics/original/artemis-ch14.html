<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 14 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/artemis-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The three Furies bowed as one, the warrior women&#39;s
expressions a mix of determined and respectful. &quot;We
must go,&quot; the Searcher said simply, &quot;it&#39;s past time.&quot;

&quot;Zeus hates the three of you for hurting him,&quot; Diana
frowned as the tawny haired huntress said, &quot;he&#39;ll try
to kill you the first chance he gets.&quot;

&quot;He can try,&quot; the Judge answered calmly. Softening her
tone just a bit she said, &quot;Vengeance fought him alone,
as has been our custom, but we&#39;ve learned from our
error. When next we face Zeus, he will battle three.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re right love,&quot; Circe told her lover softly as
the blonde sorceress continued, &quot;and in truth there is
great power in threes, too. Zeus will not find
battling them easily.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for your shelter,&quot; Vengeance bowed, her
usually cold eyes softened a bit, &quot;we will not forget
the debt we owe you.&quot;

With that the three unearthly warriors left, striding
through the jostling crowd in the bar and then out the
front door before simply disappearing. Few in the
crowd noticed, and those that did knew enough of the
supernatural not to comment on it.

Diana sighed, &quot;We could have used their help if Zeus
ever hit us again.&quot;

From where she was polishing the bar nearby Descent
shook her head wryly, her long and glossy black hair
flowing over near bone pale skin. &quot;I still can&#39;t get
over it,&quot; she said with amusement, &quot;gods walk among
us.&quot;

&quot;Where did you think gods went to once they were no
longer worshipped?&quot; Circe smirked. A bit more
seriously she asked, &quot;How is Sam handling it?&quot;

Sister Samantha Theresa was a Templar and a soldier of
God who had taken refuge in the bar along with Descent
a few weeks ago. After they had both recovered from
their various injuries they had adopted the bar as
their headquarters, working part time and promising
not to bring their crusade into the bar itself.

Descent shook her head, &quot;She&#39;s not. Instead she&#39;s
decided that you&#39;re merely extremely powerful beings
who think they&#39;re the old gods.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s an awfully thin rationalization,&quot; Diana
blinked.

Athena returned from where she had been delivering a
round of drinks, the blonde athlete scowling slightly.
&quot;Well, whatever gets you through the day,&quot; she said,
having overhead at least some of the conversation.

&quot;You look happy,&quot; Circe blinked.

&quot;I found out one of my students is being hassled on
campus,&quot; Athena said to her shortly, &quot;and I may have
to take steps.&quot;

&quot;As in?&quot; Diana raised a worried eyebrow. Despite
Athena&#39;s wisdom she was known to have a temper, and
she might be considering something rash.

&quot;Nothing like that,&quot; Athena waved it off, &quot;I&#39;m
considering a formal complaint, tho. I know they have
anti-discrimination policies, they&#39;re just not
enforcing them.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the situation?&quot; Circe asked curiously.

&quot;She&#39;s one of yours, actually,&quot; Athena noted, &quot;Shannon
Mcgee.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Circe straightened up in alarm, her eyes
narrowing in anger. Shannon was a member of her circle
of mystics as well as a good woman, and the idea of
her being in some kind of trouble concerned her
greatly.

&quot;Shannon&#39;s being hassled over her being a druid,&quot;
Athena explained, &quot;despite the freedom of religion
provisions at the university. So I expect I&#39;ll have to
dust off my lawyer cap and go down there to do
battle.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a lawyer, too?&quot; Descent looked curious.

&quot;If it involves using knowledge of information I can
do it,&quot; Athena calmly explained, &quot;it&#39;s one of my godly
gifts.&quot;

&quot;Do you want me to magic up a license?&quot; Circe offered
grimly.

&quot;No, I plan to take the exam this afternoon,&quot; Athena
said, &quot;I&#39;ll pass, of course. However, are you willing
to be an expert if I need one?&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Circe answered promptly.

&quot;Wish I could send someone with you two,&quot; Diana sighed
softly, &quot;I don&#39;t want to think of the kind of trouble
you could get into on your own.&quot;

&quot;What trouble could we get into?&quot; Athena asked
innocently.

Diana shuddered, &quot;The mind boggles.&quot;

A young man&#39;s bitter complaints soon became known as
he strode up, long black hair flowing over his back.
&quot;Would somebody please stop that crazy lady?&quot; he
bitched, &quot;She groped my girlfriend then grabbed my
ass!&quot;

&quot;Lead the way,&quot; Diana sighed, leaving her lover and
sister behind to attend to business. They hurried over
to the corner table then Diana bit back a groan, &quot;Her
again.&quot;

Liliandra smiled cheerfully as she juggled beer
bottles, sitting cross-legged on top of the table. her
blonde hair and glasses made her look deceptively
normal, but to Diana&#39;s perceptions she seemed to
shimmer with chaotic energies.

&quot;Hey, back already?&quot; Liliandra smirked.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Diana asked, rolling her
eyes. Dropping her voice a bit she added, &quot;I thought
Loki said you couldn&#39;t come here any more.&quot;

&quot;Dad is such a worry wart,&quot; Liliandra shrugged
casually, &quot;he&#39;s always scared I&#39;m going to trigger
Ragnarok early.&quot; She looked Diana up and down boldly,
&quot;You still seeing Circe?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Diana flushed faintly.

Liliandra pouted, &quot;Too bad.&quot;

Diana fought back a headache, &quot;I can see why Loki
thinks you&#39;re more trouble than Hel, Fenris and the
Midguard Serpent combined.&quot;

&quot;Dad said that?&quot; Liliandra raised her eyebrows in
pleasant surprise, &quot;I&#39;m touched.&quot;

Diana groaned, quickly trying to think of how to
reason with what amounted to a chaos goddess.
Ultimately deciding it was a waste of time she gave
up. &quot;Try not to make too much of a spectacle of
yourself?&quot; she asked instead.

&quot;Would I do that?&quot; Liliandra batted her eyes
innocently.

Diana looked around for a familiar face then smiled
when she saw her in the crowd and called, &quot;Hey,
Amaterasu!&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Amaterasu answered, the redhead carrying her
cup of sake over with her. She seemed to glow with a
regal power, her eyes touched with a gentle kind of
mirth.

&quot;Meet Liliandra,&quot; Diana gestured. Dropping her voice a
bit, &quot;You mind keeping her out of trouble for a
while?&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; Amaterasu looked amused by the hungry
look in the other woman&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Susanoo isn&#39;t going to mind, right?&quot; Diana remembered
to asked.

Amaterasu shrugged casually as she answered, &quot;We&#39;re
estranged now anyway.&quot; She sat down at Liliandra&#39;s
table and smiled at the other goddess, &quot;So, come here
often?&quot;

Liliandra laughed, &quot;As much as I can.&quot;

&#39;Good, they should keep each other out of trouble at
least,&#39; Diana thought as she headed back up to the
bar. &quot;Where are Athena and Circe?&quot; she asked Descent
curiously.

&quot;They already left,&quot; Descent said dryly. She actually
smiled slightly, &quot;I think Athena&#39;s exact words were
that they&#39;d better go before you decided to chaperone
them.&quot;

&quot;Great,&quot; Diana scowled.

&quot;I talked Sam into going with them,&quot; Descent added,
&quot;that should help.&quot;

&quot;Hope so,&quot; Diana sighed.</pre>
