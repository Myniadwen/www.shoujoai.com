<h1>The Exorcist and the Demon (part 1 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      As the young man walked along the central street, he tried to avoid the odd glances of 
the other pedestrians. In this small town, it would seem rather odd to see a young man clad 
in all white with a scarf covering his face and makeshift turban hiding his head. The only 
things they could see were his blue eyes and the fingers barely exposed by his gloves. 
Perhaps it was better that way; he was blushing from head to toe, but no one could tell 
through his attire.

      Exactly what was he doing, walking through a small town with a pack on his back and a 
long object bundled up in cloth? He was an exorcist, a person who vanquishes evil demons, 
spirits and performs the occasional funeral rites for pet rabbits. He was well aware that 
his profession wasn&#39;t the grandest of them all. That and his outfit blinded people on a 
sunny day. Still ignoring the strange looks of passerby&#39;s and overhearing a child asking his 
mother if the young man was a leper, the exorcist pulled out a piece of paper with an 
address on it.

      What our wonderful exorcist didn&#39;t know was that he was about to get the job of a 
lifetime. 

***** 

      &quot;Thank you for coming.&quot; As soon as he had knocked on the door, a woman had ushered him 
in. He took a brief look around the house and realized that it was just like any other 
suburban house: antiques, picture frames and the occasional magazine. He was practically 
shoved into the couch by the distraught woman. He quickly looked at all the people in the 
room. There was the woman and a few men there.

      One of the men stepped forward and shook his hand. &quot;I&#39;m Matt Lamet and this is my 
wife, Melanie.&quot; The woman briefly nodded before sitting down herself. &quot;The priest 
recommended calling up an exorcist such as yourself. We&#39;re sorry we didn&#39;t have enough time 
to give you the details.&quot;

      The young man gave a nod to the priest and just shook his head at Matt. &quot;No, no. I 
completely understand. I&#39;m here to help.&quot; The young man&#39;s voice was lilting, soft and 
everyone in the room found it strange.

      &quot;...Don&#39;t you want to take off that scarf? It&#39;s so hot today,&quot; Melanie said and went 
over to remove some of the exorcist&#39;s clothing, but he just shied away. &quot;No, no, no. It&#39;s 
fine. I&#39;m wearing this because I have to keep my identity a secret. Not all demons and 
spirits are evil; therefore I don&#39;t kill every single one. I keep my professional and 
private life separate.&quot; Everyone in the room regarded him with strange suspicion, but they 
said nothing.

      Another man in the room started to speak. &quot;The problem is, there&#39;s a demon that lives 
near here. We&#39;re not sure what its motives are, but sometimes it... well, it attacks young 
girls in their sleep.&quot; The man next to him nodded. &quot;It got both our daughters!&quot;

      The exorcist looked over at the priest. &quot;What happened to the girls? How old were 
they?&quot; The priest gave a sympathetic look to the men before answering. &quot;The demon does this 
occasionally and the girls tend to be around 17 when it happens. It infiltrates their dreams 
and... taints them, for lack of a better term. The result is that they become uninterested 
in all men.&quot;

      No one could see the confused expression on the exorcist&#39;s face. &quot;Wait. They just 
don&#39;t like other guys anymore except for the demon?&quot; Everyone in the room flinched. &quot;We... 
don&#39;t wish to talk about it. The afflicted girls are currently... living a normal life,&quot; 
said the priest.

      &quot;Is that the problem? If so, I can just go mediate with the demon-&quot; The exorcist&#39;s 
words were interrupted by Matt. &quot;No. The demon did something treacherous yesterday and 
that&#39;s why we called you on such short notice.&quot;

      He walked over to a coffee table and gave a picture frame to the exorcist. The picture 
was that of a cute young girl, probably 14. She had bright blue eyes and short, wild black 
hair. Regardless, her clothes denoted a very feminine and clean cut girl.

      &quot;Our daughter, Mina, was kidnapped by the demon. She&#39;s only 14 and we don&#39;t know what 
the demon wants with her.&quot; Matt wrapped an arm around the distraught Melanie. The exorcist 
set down the frame. &quot;I see. I will prepare tonight and set out tomorrow.&quot; He stood up and 
thanked them all for their time before going out the door.  

***** 

      It was at the bed and breakfast that he met her... the second little girl that would 
lead him down a path of... well, &#39;complications&#39; would be the best word. The owner of the 
place, Abby Kasaguri, led him to one of the free rooms and explained the rules. He was 
getting free room as payment for his services. &quot;I hope you rescue Mina, for my daughter&#39;s 
sake,&quot; said Abby.

      &quot;What? But Mina is the daughter of...&quot; The exorcist was cut off as Abby shook her 
head. &quot;No, my daughter is best friends with Mina. She&#39;s been worried sick ever since she 
disappeared.&quot; As the woman walked off, the exorcist entered the room and thought nothing 
more of Abby&#39;s daughter. 

***** 

      When the exorcist saw the blonde 14 year old girl at his door, he knew she was the 
total antithesis of Mina Lamet. Her only girlish features were her cute face and long blonde 
hair tied up with a ribbon. Otherwise her developing curves were covered by slightly baggy 
shirt with a strange pattern and torn up jeans. This girl was none other Eveon Kasaguri, 
Mina&#39;s one and only best friend.

      &quot;You&#39;re supposed to save Mina, right?&quot; she asked, as though surprised he was in the 
room. &quot;Why aren&#39;t you going to the forest right now?!&quot; The young girl&#39;s tone was almost 
turning into something of a shriek.

      &quot;Look, I can&#39;t rush in blindly if I want to save-&quot; The exorcist&#39;s words were cut off 
as she got angrier. &quot;My best friend is being held captive by demon that could be doing 
THINGS to her. THINGS! You do realize that if you don&#39;t get your rear in gear that this will 
be the second night that she&#39;s being held captive?&quot;

      The young man could only back up out of fear. Talk about a young spitfire... &quot;I knew 
this was a bad idea! Mr. Lamet should have listened to me...&quot; As suddenly as she had shown 
up, Eveon turned around and left his room in a huff. It wasn&#39;t even sunset yet and the 
exorcist could already feel trouble on the horizon. He had just gotten told off by a 14 year 
old.

      ...that was pathetic. 

***** 

      &quot;I can&#39;t believe that guy...&quot; Eveon murmured to herself as she started putting items 
in her backpack. If no one was going to confront that demon then she was going to do it 
herself! She put some food in her pack, along with a compass, some water and a map of the 
forest. How could everyone just wait? Who knew what could be happening to Mina...?

      Eveon put on her hiking boots and grabbed her flashlight. She would save her best 
friend... she would do it because no one else dared to. She grabbed the photo album that 
Mina had given to her last year. Since then, she had filled it up with all of the pictures 
they had taken together. As she flipped through the pages, she pulled out one of her fondest 
pictures. Mina had set the self timer on the camera and practically shoved Eveon in front of 
it, before intimately wrapping her arms around the blonde&#39;s neck.

      Thus the embarrassing picture showed a blushing Eveon with a beautiful Mina embracing 
her. Eveon stuck in her pocket, knowing it would crinkle. No matter; when she brought back 
Mina, they could just make more copies of it.

      She slipped out of the window and started her silent trek towards the woods. Once she 
got in there, she could turn on her flashlight without being noticed and-

      Her thoughts were cut off as a gloved hand clasped over her mouth and another wrapped 
around her waist. She struggled and over the sound of her muffled shrieks she heard, &quot;Calm 
down, it&#39;s just me, the exorcist.&quot; Her eyes widened at his soft voice and he let her go 
before promptly grabbing her wrist and bringing her back to the bed and breakfast.

      &quot;What are you doing out here?&quot; she asked him and he said, &quot;I could ask you the same.&quot; 
She lowered her head in frustration as he dragged her back into his room.

      &quot;You&#39;re going to stay here with me so you don&#39;t pull another stunt like that.&quot; Eveon 
opened her mouth to ask how he&#39;d known and he just smiled beneath the scarf. &quot;I could see 
through the window.&quot;

      The blonde hung her head and took off her backpack. &quot;You better not do anything to me, 
you creeper. My mommy can paralyze a healthy man in one hit!&quot; The exorcist raised up his 
hands to defend himself.

      &quot;Hey! I-I-I&#39;m not like that! I&#39;m all about purity and dating people your own age!&quot; 
Eveon just laughed at his antics and sat on one of the beds. Luckily, his room had two in 
it... &quot;Hey, Mr. Exorcist. What is your name, anyhow?&quot;

      The young man clad in all white just gave her a curious look with his blue eyes. 
&quot;...Just call me exorcist or whatever. I keep my personal and professional life separate, so 
it&#39;s reasonable for me not to tell you my name.&quot;

      The young girl crossed her arms defiantly. &quot;Whatever. You better save Mina tomorrow!&quot; 
He just nodded and spied the photo sticking out of her pocket. &quot;What&#39;s that,&quot; he asked.

      Eveon blushed and gave it to him to look at. He let his eyes take in the intimate pose 
of the two girls before letting out a sigh. &quot;You two are really close, huh?&quot; Eveon looked 
down at the ground solemnly. &quot;...yeah... it&#39;s... it&#39;s my fault she got kidnapped.&quot;

      His head perked up as she said that. Her eyes darted from him back to the floor. 
&quot;Mina&#39;s been acting strange for the last couple of weeks. Every time she looked at me, she 
was happy, but she always had this strange expression in her eyes,&quot; she took a deep breath 
and continued, &quot;On the day she was kidnapped, a boy from school asked me out. I told him I 
would think about it and I met up with Mina after school. She asked me if I wanted to go out 
to eat or something and then I told her about the boy. She looked really upset and I didn&#39;t 
know why. We got into an argument about him and then she ran off into the woods crying. I 
was really pissed at her so I... so I...&quot;

      The exorcist placed a comforting hand on her head. &quot;I just let her go. When she hadn&#39;t 
come back an hour later, I searched and I searched and I searched... They found her backpack 
in the forest and we knew the demon got her.&quot;

      The exorcist stood up and gave her a smile she couldn&#39;t see. &quot;Tomorrow, we&#39;ll go to 
the demon&#39;s lair and rescue her.&quot; Eveon let out a scoff at his words. &quot;Hah... what can we... 
We?&quot; She gave him a look of disbelief.

      &quot;That&#39;s right, Eveon. Together, we&#39;ll rescue Mina. She&#39;ll be so much more relieved if 
she sees a familiar face, huh?&quot; The young girl was teary eyed and started to laugh. &quot;What 
can we do? I&#39;m just a little girl and you&#39;re a scrawny boy!&quot;

      He blushed and looked down at himself. Sure, he wasn&#39;t that tall, but still! He let 
out a debilitating sigh and went to the bathroom. &quot;I&#39;ve got some organizing to do... get 
some rest Eveon.&quot; The blonde girl continued to laugh at him, but she settled into one of the 
beds nonetheless, her laughter dying out. The exorcist looked through his manuscripts and 
packed his bag as to prepare for tomorrow. He was most likely dealing with a demon that 
seduced young girls. Sounded simple enough...

      An hour passed and he peeked at Eveon to see the girl was sound asleep. He pulled the 
covers over her still form and turned out a lamp. The young man slinked towards the bathroom 
and closed to door. Letting out a sigh, he began to remove the turban and scarf.

      Fine, blonde hair tumbled down as it was released from its bondage and the scarf 
revealed soft features. The discarded cloth was soon joined by a shirt. As the chest 
bandages were undone, breasts spilled out and soon discarded pants revealed smooth legs and 
a hint of curvy hips.

      In front of the mirror stood a young woman, barely 19 and very beautiful. Beneath her 
clothing were subtle curves, long blonde hair and beautiful face. This was why she kept her 
personal and professional life separate. Krystal was a 19 year old college student (her 
profession had her taking online classes) with a vast amount of holy power. As such, she 
devoted her abilities to helping people.

      She started the shower and sighed as she stretched. By dressing as man and trying to 
disguise her voice, it made it easier to defeat demons. Demons, like people, were attracted 
to her beauty and her modesty led to her covering up. It was then that she realized that 
male demons wouldn&#39;t try to seduce her and the female demons who tried would utterly fail.

      Her plan was foolproof. As she stepped into the shower, she went over in her head the 
plan to rescue Mina. They would go in there, try to negotiate with the demon and if that 
didn&#39;t work... there would probably be a fight.
