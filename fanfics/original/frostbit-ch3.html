<h1>Frost Bitten (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/frostbit-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Some weeks later Sharon scooted across her office on
her old fashioned office chair, the wheels squeaking
loudly as she smoothly grabbed at the ringing phone
from her desk. &quot;Yes?&quot; the brown haired professor
asked.

&quot;It&#39;s just me hon,&quot; Liz answered and Sharon could
almost imagine the black haired woman&#39;s warm smile.
They had moved in together some months back but it
still felt like they were some kind of newlyweds,
especially with their recent decision to come out to
their friends.

&quot;Hi, love,&quot; Sharon smiled back, happy to hear her
voice then she asked, &quot;so what&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Just calling to give you a heads up,&quot; Liz sounded
amused as she continued on, &quot;I just got a call from
Olivia asking about Tam.&quot;

&quot;Tam?&quot; Sharon blinked, thinking about the fourth young
woman who had joined them on a little winter&#39;s holiday
recently.

&quot;She was asking for Tam&#39;s home phone number, that sort
of thing,&quot; Liz explained, &quot;but I didn&#39;t have them
handy, so I bet Olivia will call you up next.&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Sharon said thoughtfully, &quot;but I wonder
why...?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll know soon enough,&quot; Liz chuckled, &quot;I&#39;ll see you
tonight.&quot;

&quot;Bye,&quot; Sharon hung up, the phone ringing a few seconds
later. &quot;Hello?&quot; Sharon asked, feeling reasonably
certain who it was.

&quot;Sharon, hi,&quot; Olivia said, not sounding happy at all.
She continued grimly, &quot;Since your line was busy I
guess Liz was calling?&quot;

Sharon had to smile, knowing how predictable they all
were in a way. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she confirmed, &quot;she mentioned
you were looking for Tam&#39;s number?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am,&quot; Olivia softly agreed. She hesitated for a
few seconds then asked, &quot;Maybe you could give me some
advice?&quot;

Her eyebrows went up in honest surprise when Sharon
heard that. Olivia, in her experience, was supremely
self confident and almost never asked for assistance
or advice from anyone. &quot;How can I help?&quot; she asked.

&quot;You remember when we got snowed in up at your
grandmother&#39;s cabin,&quot; Olivia said, &quot;Tam and I... well,
we slept together.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Sharon felt herself grin.

&quot;Tam told you?!&quot; Olivia burst out.

&quot;No,&quot; Sharon answered her honestly, &quot;it was obvious
from the way you two were with each other all week.&quot;
She smiled thoughtfully, &quot;The only time you left her
side was to break up with your boytoy, from what I
recall.&quot;

&quot;I... hadn&#39;t thought about that,&quot; Olivia admitted.

&quot;So what happened?&quot; Sharon asked eagerly.

&quot;We had three nights of absolutely mind-blowing sex,&quot;
Olivia almost sounded like she wanted to cry as she
said, &quot;then I said good-bye, figuring that was going
to be it.&quot; Weakly she added, &quot;But I can&#39;t get her out
of my mind!&quot;

Sharon shook her head grimly, thinking of a nearly
tearful call she had gotten from Tam just last week,
asking for advice on how to handle an unnamed woman,
most probably Olivia. She had encouraged Tam to take
the first step, but obviously she hadn&#39;t yet.

&quot;What do you think I should do?&quot; Olivia asked softly.

&quot;I guess I have to ask how serious you are about her,&quot;
Sharon said after a moment&#39;s though. &quot;Is this just a
temporary obsession or are you really interested in
her?&quot;

&quot;The sex was incredible,&quot; Olivia admitted, &quot;but I
think I enjoyed being with her, talking together
almost as much.&quot;

&quot;Tam is the sort of girl you don&#39;t play around with,&quot;
Sharon cautioned her as she casually thumped her foot
against her wooden desk, &quot;you&#39;re going to have to
change your ways if you want her, my wild friend.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not as wild as you might think,&quot; Olivia said a
bit wryly, &quot;I think you and Liz liked to exaggerate my
reputation in your minds.&quot;

&quot;This from the woman who tried to get me and Liz into
bed at different times,&quot; Sharon said with a wicked
smile.

&quot;You two compared notes, huh?&quot; Olivia sounded wounded,
&quot;It was back in college, it shouldn&#39;t count now that
we&#39;re out in the real world.&quot;

Sharon just laughed. Getting back to the subject she
asked Olivia seriously, &quot;What do you want to do about
Tam?&quot;

&quot;What I want to do I can&#39;t say over the phone,&quot; Olivia
replied. She took a deep breath, &quot;Once you give me her
number I&#39;ll ask Tam out to lunch and tell her how I
feel... and find out if she even wants to take me on.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t break any confidences,&quot; Sharon chose her
words very carefully, &quot;but I&#39;m pretty certain Tam
would want to hear from you.&quot;

There was a break, then finally a very relieved
sounding Olivia said, &quot;Thanks, Sharon.&quot; A bit more
briskly she continued, &quot;I&#39;d better get off the line, I
have a phone call to make.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Sharon said sincerely. She grinned and
added, &quot;And phone me once you talk to Tam, I want to
hear how this turns out.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Olivia signed off.

Sitting in the office of her high class boutique
Olivia put down the phone, the lovely blonde looking
sleek dressed in her usual business wear. Getting up
she strolled out into the store, looking at the women
circulating between the racks, her three employees
helping customers find the fashions they wanted or
guiding them to what would suit them.

With a smile Olivia strode back into her office,
sitting behind her desk and taking a steadying breath.
&#39;You can do this,&#39; she thought, and began to dial...
only to have the phone ring under her hand, making her
jump. &quot;Yes?&quot; Olivia asked, trying to keep any
nervousness out of her voice.

&quot;Olivia,&quot; that oh-so familiar midwest accent almost
made her bones melt, &quot;it&#39;s Tam.&quot;

&quot;I was just about to call you,&quot; Olivia couldn&#39;t
believe she was admitting that.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Tam confessed, &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to get
the nerve up to call you, too.&quot;

Olivia felt herself relax a bit, hearing the sweet
nervousness that came across in Tam&#39;s voice. &quot;I&#39;m glad
you called,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I think,&quot; she hesitated,
not too sure if it was a good idea to admit it so
soon, &quot;I missed you.&quot;

&quot;Oh me too!&quot; Tam blurted and Olivia could feel a goofy
smile of relief spreading over her face. &quot;I&#39;m coming
out there for a work meeting in a few days,&quot; Tam said
a bit bashfully, &quot;I was hoping we could talk.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to see you too,&quot; Olivia agreed. She took a
steadying breath, &quot;Those nights up at the cabin.. they
were more than a one night stand for me.&quot;

&quot;I wanted it to be more that too,&quot; Tam confessed,
&quot;that&#39;s why it was so hard to say good-bye to you,
that last day.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Olivia asked.

&quot;Long distance relationships aren&#39;t easy,&quot; Tam
murmured, &quot;but I want to get to know you better,
Olivia.&quot; A second break, &quot;And there&#39;s always positions
open for a professor who&#39;s been published as much as I
have.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d move to be with me?&quot; Olivia asked softly,
surprised.

&quot;If it was serious enough, yes,&quot; Tam answered
honestly.

&quot;You know,&quot; Olivia murmured thoughtfully, &quot;opening
another branch of my boutique out in your town would
require a great deal of my personal attention.&quot; She
smiled as she heard a happy sigh from the other end,
&quot;We can work things out, I think.&quot;

&quot;What days are you free next week,&quot; Tam asked eagerly,
&quot;I&#39;ll take you out to dinner.&quot;

Olivia leaned forward in her chair happily, &quot;I&#39;ll show
you the best restaurants.....&quot;

End.

Authors Notes: After the second episode of this story
it occurred to me that things were still unresolved in
several ways, with Tam and Olivia&#39;s fate left up in
the air, Being remarkably obsessive I decided to add
another chapter, dealing with them as well as touching
on Sharon and Liz&#39;s situation.</pre>
