<a href="../original/champions-ch52.html">Back to Part 52</a><pre>[...] And I saw a beast coming out of the sea.  He had ten horns and 
seven heads, with ten crowns on his horns, and on each head a 
blasphemous name.  [...] The dragon gave the beast his power and his 
throne and great authority.  One of the heads of the beast seemed to 
have had a fatal wound, but the fatal wound had been healed.  The whole 
world was astonished and followed the beast. &#150;Revelations 13: 1-4

----------

&quot;Are you ready?&quot; asked Kali, extending her hand.  Lyn nodded timidly and 
took it.  She had came this far, so for better or for worse, she would 
see it through to the end.  Carefully, the two waded their way through 
the waters again, drenching their clothes in the crystalline water.  
They began to ascend the spire, that zenith from which the water flowed, 
presumably to the top where the ritual would take place.  But no sooner 
had Lyn began her ascent did a voice cry out, one she thought would 
never haunt her ears again.

&quot;WAIT!!  Hold it!  Stop!!&quot;

It was Mora Johsen, the Cobra, that miserable creature Lyn hated, yet at 
the same time, understood and even loved to a degree.  She halted as 
requested, turned to ascertain the truth, and revealed her greatest 
scowl.  Not only Lyn, but the whole gang was here.  Kali leaped down 
from the spire, Lyn coming after her, and grinned maliciously at those 
who had come to witness this event.

&quot;You&#39;re too late.  There will be no stopping our bonding ritual.  Once 
my sister and I fuse our bodies together in perfect harmony, the world 
will be under our thumb.  We will bring about an age of order and reason 
again, where death shall cleanse and where life shall renew again.  This 
woman is mine.  You have no hope of stopping us.&quot;

Mora Johsen smiled.  She loved it when people said something was 
impossible.

&quot;We&#39;ll see about that.  But first, I wanna have a word with Lyn!  Hey, 
Bloodbane!  Get your stupid ugly ass down here now!&quot;  There was no need 
to egg the silver-haired woman on like that; she willingly came of her 
own accord, scowling with restrained fury.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing here, woman?&quot; she spat, as venomous as 
any snake.  More looked at her with indignity.

&quot;You don&#39;t know?  I&#39;ve come to pull you away from this freak and slap 
some sense into you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a little late.  Kali&#39;s my sister and I&#39;m going to bond with 
her.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s with all the rubbish all of a sudden?  Has she gotten you 
brainwashed?&quot;

&quot;This is just the path I&#39;ve chosen, Mora.  You can&#39;t force me to do 
anything else.&quot;

&quot;Like hell I can!&quot; she screamed.  &quot;Do you even know what you&#39;re saying?!  
&#39;Bond with her&#39;?  Do you even know what that means?  You&#39;re full of it!&quot;

&quot;(Quite the diplomat, isn&#39;t she?)&quot; muttered Kristen.  Xianq muffled her 
laughter.

&quot;Why are you doing this, Kathlyn?&quot; Mora asked, her voice more calm now.  
&quot;This woman is a perfect stranger.  You&#39;ve never even met her until she 
came around.  Lyn, this woman is a killer.  She put Rin, Kailin, 
Marissa, and Sanaa out of commission, and nearly did the same to 
Setsuka.  What do you think she&#39;ll do next?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, and I don&#39;t care.  I don&#39;t expect you to understand me, 
either.&quot;

&quot;Understand you?  What&#39;s to understand?  You might be a little nuts 
yourself, but I&#39;d never figure you to be the type to team up with a 
psycho!&quot;

&quot;I am still here, you know,&quot; Kali interrupted.  Xianq hissed at her and 
urged the two women to continue their issue resolution.

&quot;You just don&#39;t get it,&quot; Lyn continued, crossing her arms.  &quot;I grew up 
without a family, without even a home.  I don&#39;t know where I cam from, 
and I don&#39;t know how I got here.  For all I know, I really could be this 
woman&#39;s relative.  I do admit that she&#39;s psychotic, and dangerous, and 
even repulsive, but damn it, Mora, she&#39;s the closest thing to family 
I&#39;ve had.  Nobody else has ever cared for me as much as her.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re damn wrong about that,&quot; spat the Cobra, fighting a losing battle 
with her tears.  &quot;I don&#39;t know about anyone else, but you and I sure as 
hell connected.  Sure, I hated your guts, and I couldn&#39;t stand your 
attitude.  You wanna know why?  Because it reminded me of myself, of how 
miserable and selfish I was.  I was looking right into a mirror every 
time I saw your face, and I hated what I saw.  Fighting you was a way of 
fighting myself; hating you was a way of hating who I used to be.  
And...during all those peaceful moments when we were good to each other, 
I felt love, because...I could look at myself and see something new 
there.  Something nice.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re breaking my heart,&quot; grumbled Lyn, heavy on the sarcasm.  &quot;If 
you&#39;d be so kind as to get away from my sight, I&#39;ve got some unfinished 
business to take care of.  I&#39;ll kill you after that, unless you think 
you can beat me now.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think, Lyn, I know.  And if I have to knock some sense into 
you, then so help me God, I&#39;ll do it!&quot;  The two women met with great 
speed; their fight was nigh unwatchable.  This was not the graceful, 
stylized motions of two veteran warriors who could take their time, 
study their opponents, and come up with a solution to every problem&#151;no, 
these were just two brutes destroying one another, lashing at each other 
with whatever they had, like senseless bison dueling over a mate.  It 
was impossible for either woman to take an advantage:  Mora had very 
thick skin and could survive a bullet wound at point-blank range; Lyn 
was scarred more, but every drop of blood produced another tiny weapon 
for her arsenal.

Like any good sister would, Kali soon realized she&#39;d have to step in if 
she wanted to tip the scales.  She jumped forth, but was tackled 
suddenly by Kristen, who had to use all of the strength at her disposal 
to restrain the vile woman.  With her briefly out of the picture, Mora 
and Lyn could resume their fight without hindrance; the battle was so 
bloody that even the most desensitized person had to look away at times.  
Both sides seemed evenly-matched; there&#39;d be no end, unless it was 
brought about by exhaustion.  This even became clear to the combatants, 
who (in spite of their bruises, cuts, and wounds) knew it would now be a 
battle of stamina and will, not merely ego.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have come here,&quot; Lyn growled, a trail of blood forming on 
her chin.  &quot;It would&#39;ve been best if you had not gotten your nose in 
this at all.  Who knows&#151;I might have been inclined to spare you if you 
had.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s too late for that now,&quot; Mora stated.  &quot;I&#39;m here, and I&#39;m not 
leaving without you.  Damn it, Lyn, you get on my nerves, I hate your 
guts, and I can&#39;t stand the sight of you, but somehow I still manage to 
love you.  I won&#39;t give up!&quot;

&quot;Stirring speeches went out ten years ago.  I hope you won&#39;t make any 
more!&quot;  Instead of talking, Mora let her actions speak for her and 
slugged Kathlyn right in her jaw.  She dove quickly and grabbed the 
woman before she could fall, embracing her with all her strength.  Lyn 
tried to fight back, but Mora&#39;s hug was strong, as strong as her 
determination.

&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; she said, again and again, &quot;I won&#39;t give up, I won&#39;t.  I&#39;m 
taking you back with me.  Why are you even here, Lyn?  Why?  Do you need 
somewhere to belong that badly?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t even know the half of it,&quot; she growled.  Mora suddenly roared 
back with all her fury, shocking her rival.

&quot;YOU STUPID BITCH, DO YOU REALLY THINK YOU&#39;RE THE ONLY ONE WHO&#39;S LIKE 
THAT!!  I went through the same Hell, okay?  That&#39;s how we&#39;re able to 
connect, because we know what the other woman&#39;s been through!  And 
now...&quot;  Mora couldn&#39;t stop it:  she was crying.  She was actually 
crying for Kathlyn Shival now.  &quot;Now you went and ran away, like what we 
felt didn&#39;t matter at all.  You went and...followed this psychopath you 
didn&#39;t even know, believing some shit she spouted just to get you out 
here and perform this stupid ritual...and I come all this way, because I 
still felt like you mattered to me!  And...and...th-this is how you 
repay me, damn you...  Damn you...&quot;

Mora had crumbled, all her strength gone.  The sudden burst of emotion 
had drained her; she was defeated by her own self.  And Kathlyn was with 
her, surprised to find her arms around this beast, caressing her gently, 
as if she believed she really mattered to someone.  The stone that had 
formed around her heart was melting away; she had never felt something 
like this before, not even from those who claimed they cared.  Mora had 
done all this and more, and...

&quot;I love you,&quot; she wept, her voice weary and worn-out.  &quot;I love you, 
Kathlyn.  I love you.  I want you back.  I want you back.  
Please...please don&#39;t go away.  Don&#39;t leave me alone.  I need you with 
me.  Please, Lyn...&quot;

&quot;Just shut up, stupid,&quot; moaned Lyn, combing through her rival&#39;s hair.  
&quot;Shut up and let me think.  God in heaven, for once, let me think for 
myself!  ...And the same goes for you!&quot; she roared suddenly, pointing to 
Kali.  &quot;You stay quiet!  I can&#39;t be a slave to anyone&#39;s thoughts 
anymore.  I have to do this on my own.  Now...&quot;

She took a deep breath, helped Mora stand, and embraced her.

&quot;Idiot,&quot; she said with a smile.

Kali screamed as they kissed.

&quot;This is the path I choose,&quot; she said, more or less indicating Mora 
(having one&#39;s arms wrapped around another person&#39;s neck is indication 
enough).  &quot;Not because of any previous connection, but because she has 
shown me more caring and kindness and loyalty than any other person I&#39;ve 
met.  Besides, I could never be with anyone who wasn&#39;t my equal, and who 
but the Cobra can withstand me in battle?&quot;

&quot;Celine,&quot; Kali whispered, &quot;no...&quot;

&quot;As for you,&quot; spat the venomous Bloodbane, &quot;I don&#39;t know what came over 
me when I volunteered to go with you!  I thought I didn&#39;t care about who 
you were because I held out some desperate shred of hope that somebody 
would be nice to me, but how deluded could I get?  Mora&#39;s right&#151;you&#39;re 
nothing more than a soulless monster, a killing machine, a psychopathic 
murderer who lusts after her own flesh and blood!  I could never be 
around someone that&#39;s killed so many without good reason!&quot;

&quot;Celine,&quot; begged the goddess, &quot;they&#39;re just people.  They die all the 
time.  Somebody has to keep them in check, or they&#39;ll live forever.  I 
was just&#151;&quot;

&quot;Stop it!  My name isn&#39;t Celine; I am Kathlyn Shival, known by no other 
name, and I will not be your cohort any more.  This is the path I 
choose.&quot;

And then, she said the most sensible thing anybody ever heard.

&quot;Let&#39;s go home, Mora.&quot;

Together they walked, hand in hand, and slowly, the rest of the ensemble 
followed them.  The last thread seemed wound up nicely, but Kali 
wouldn&#39;t have any of it.  She summoned up all her rage and strength, and 
threw Kristen off her back with a mighty burst of energy.  The team 
snapped into action; Kali&#39;s weapon was out first, hurtling towards the 
one who had forced her beloved sister to become a traitor.  Mora saw the 
energy-snake and, fearing it was meant for Lyn, shoved the younger woman 
out of the way.  Her brave deed did not go without a price; the weapon 
sliced off her arm at the elbow, producing blood and a horrifying wail 
in its wake.

&quot;MORA!!!!!&quot;  Lyn rushed back in spite of the gruesome scene and touched 
her friend.  Johsen winced and clutched her arm.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s nothing.  I can regenerate my limbs.  It shouldn&#39;t 
take long.&quot;  Lyn turned pale, wishing more than ever to embrace this 
woman, to make up for her foolishness&#151;anything, if it was for Mora.  
Perhaps then, maybe, she began to feel the first twinges of love&#151;love at 
last returned, and to the least-likely person.  Kali, for her part, 
growled and went in to finish the job.

&quot;Oh no you don&#39;t!!&quot; shouted...Xianq Shou??  Mora couldn&#39;t believe her 
eyes as she saw sprightly little Bubblegum Black jump out from the 
crowd, run towards her foe...

&quot;Xianq, don&#39;t be a fool!!!&quot;



...and before I could say a word to stop her, one of the few people left 
in the world that I could call Friend was approaching this monster, and 
fighting her.

I had never seen anything like it, and I&#39;ve seen enough fights to make 
me sick with boredom.  This was like looking at color for the first 
time.  I had never dreamed that my friend, hyperactive little Beeg, 
could be so ruthless in battle.  I guess all those times of having her 
face wiped on the floor sent her nerves into Hell, and stoked her fury 
into vengeance.  She wanted to prove that she was worth a damn; she 
didn&#39;t want us saving her measly scrawny hide.  I could barely look as 
she locked horns with the monster.  This was not little Bubblegum Black.  
This was something else, something monstrous, and I watched it happen.

I couldn&#39;t believe it.  I had heard stories about how this demoness 
could kill; about how little effort it took her to decimate the people 
around her.  It was that weapon and her own freakish design, wrought 
from corpses by a madman insane with grief.  She was a perfect weapon, 
the true goddess of death, and one of my few friends was handling her 
the old-fashioned way, fluent like a poet bent on annihilation, savage 
and uncontrollable.  There was no way that Bubblegum Black would lose 
this fight:  she had her honor at stake now, not just the lives of so 
many people.  And she fought like a woman possessed by some demon.  The 
pink little gumwad projectiles I once thought were so useless proved to 
be her edge in this fight.  She matched Kali&#39;s ruthlessness and exceeded 
it with her own.

She was unstoppable.  Kali could break that wad apart and there&#39;d still 
be enough to smack her with.  She could snap at one pink whip and 
there&#39;d be two; she could cut two bullets and there&#39;d be four; she could 
slash at my friend&#39;s solid defenses and make them twice as strong as 
before.  That curse of hers, those little pink blobs of goo, they had 
been so damned worthless in my eyes.  After all, she had her ass kicked 
enough times to humiliate anyone.  But here she was, wasting our foe, 
burying her in attacks too gruesome to describe otherwise.  It was the 
happiest day of my life.

I tried focusing on my arm.  It felt like a surgeon had inserted a hot 
coal into my flesh, and was about to seal my amputated limb back on with 
a blowtorch.  Lyn helped me stand as she watched the battle with vague 
eyes, bless her.  I wanted to take her and love her right there; I 
wanted to best her, to beat her, and to have her beat me too.  The smell 
of blood and sex was overwhelming.  I cringed in pain, but I could 
handle it.  I&#39;m part-reptile, whether I like it or not.  I get all the 
curses and all the blessings.  When you cut the arm off a reptile, they 
don&#39;t hold much of a grudge.  They hate you for a minute, and then they 
grow that limb right back and bite your legs off.  I&#39;ve grown limbs back 
before; I can take the pain.

I cringe again.  Kali was knocked down.  Sweet little Beeg has a fire in 
her that no flood could ever put out.  She&#39;s vile.  I can hear the flesh 
break and the bones snap as she jumps on Kali&#39;s wasted body and pummels 
her.  But Kali fights back, and I think she breaks one of my friend&#39;s 
ribs as she shoves her off.  That weapon of hers snaps; Bubblegum Black 
must&#39;ve devoured a whole bag of sugar just to get enough juice to power 
up that pink weapon of hers.  It&#39;s amazing how much there is to it.  I 
have to wonder if it&#39;ll ever end.  They&#39;re at it again.  They don&#39;t want 
to stop.  It&#39;s a matter of honor and pride now, one woman fighting for 
her dignity and the other for a lost cause.  My remaining hand grasps 
the sweaty, slimy palm of my enemy, my lover, and she squeezes back.  I 
want her.  She looks like she slept in a tomb.

I see no end to the fighting.  Bubblegum Black looks terrible.  She&#39;s 
been messed up real bad&#151;the price you pay for fighting any fight.  Kali 
roughed her up good, but she&#39;s the worse for wear.  I&#39;ve gotten hit with 
that pink slab of goo before, and it sure isn&#39;t an experience I&#39;d put on 
anybody except my real enemies.  It looks like she got buried underneath 
solid concrete.  Beeg&#39;s body is bruised and her face is almost red with 
blood, but I can tell that she&#39;s still hale, still strong, still 
gorgeous all over.  If Steve doesn&#39;t take her and turn her into a woman 
when all this is over, I&#39;m gonna clobber him.  The fight goes on, but I 
think we all know who the winner is.  I wish my arm&#39;d grow back sooner.  
I don&#39;t want to stay like this longer than I have to.

Kali&#39;s knocked back again, but she gets on her feet.  The woman is 
terrible.  You&#39;d believe she was made out of mud from the look of her.  
Even Lyn can see there&#39;s no relation between the two; this is a monster, 
a spawn of the devil, something that shouldn&#39;t have lived in the first 
place.  She looks like she wants to continue...and then, the shadow 
comes.  It&#39;s not Amielle&#151;I can see her clutching Alicia&#39;s hand firmly as 
they watch the battle&#151;it&#39;s something else, something twisted, something 
much, much worse.  The shadow takes a hold of Kali and pins her with 
powerful arms.  They drive their mouth into her neck and start to chew, 
like a perverse rat.  Everyone&#39;s on edge.  My arm refuses to come out.  
We all know that shadow, but what the hell is she doing here?

Kamaguchi, you slimeball bitch, what are you doing now?

Our worst nightmares are eclipsed by something much more real and 
savage.  The creature before us is neither woman nor organic, but 
something gruesome instead, dredged up from the intestines of hate.  The 
sky becomes dark.  Something terrible is happening, I can feel it in the 
air.  Kali screams as if she&#39;s never known pain before this moment.  I 
actually feel sorry for the monster.  Even she shouldn&#39;t be in this 
situation.  She&#39;s too good for it.  I want to shut out the horror, but 
my eyes stay open, some evil magic keeping their lids wide.  I wept for 
fear.  Lyn, God bless her, shows character I am unworthy of being around 
and goes after Kali, thinking she can redeem the creature.  Kali 
understands what her false sister is doing, and even though she&#39;s been 
betrayed, some measure of human kindness still exists in that woman, and 
she shoves Lyn away from her, saving her from Yohko&#39;s death-trap.

The doctor absorbs Kali into her body, and we never see her again.  I&#39;ve 
never been scared so witless before in all my life, and I&#39;ve seen things 
that would twist people&#39;s minds.  Most of our number can&#39;t seem to draw 
away from the carnal show; Joyce seems like she can understand it, that 
little child of nightmares.  My skin crawls like there&#39;s a family of 
roaches buried beneath it.  Kamaguchi speaks, but it&#39;s not her voice.

&quot;What POWER!!!  I&#39;ve never felt anything like this in all my life!  This 
was definitely the vessel of the gods, the fabled Merkavah, the one I&#39;ve 
been looking for to store all my wisdom and strength in.  Yes...yes...  
Combined with all the best traits of the two species, and now this body, 
I can achieve what I have set out to do ever since my brother&#39;s death!  
Take one last look at this face, you devils!  It&#39;ll be the last time you 
ever see it!  What shall replace her will be too beautiful and perfect 
to bear!&quot;

Nonsense, I know, but it compels us.  Then something happens that none 
of us would&#39;ve ever suspected:  Yohko&#39;s body shifts, it changes, it 
mutates, like it&#39;s made out of putty.  I can&#39;t move.  The terror 
paralyzes me.  Even the pain in my arm has died.  I&#39;m all out of 
fright-tears; I can barely cling to the woman I fought for.  Doctor 
Kamaguchi becomes something else, something so vile that to call it a 
demon would be an insult to demons everywhere.  A nightmare made real 
wouldn&#39;t be able to stand up before this thing, this horrible 
abomination.  I feel like retching.  It&#39;s everything we&#39;ve ever feared 
and dreaded, made real and personal.  It was you.  It was me.  It was 
man and woman, weak and strong, love and hate, darkness and light.  It 
was everything.  Everything.  And I knew we had to kill it.

Omni.  It called itself Omni.

The name had a ring to it.

 
To be continued...
