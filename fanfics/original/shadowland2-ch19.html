<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Alyson drowsily opened an eye to see Amy kneeling over her, ripping her 
shirt off, &quot;W... wh...?&quot; She found it hard to speak, her head hurt and 
she felt in a daze. She tried to move when a pain shot through her 
entire body and she let out a small scream. 

&quot;Hold still!&quot; Amy commanded pushing the girl back to the ground, then 
tearing a piece of medical tape off of a roll with her teeth, &quot;This will 
hurt!&quot; She explained with the tape still between her teeth. Without 
another warning she wrenched Alyson&#39;s arm around and the girl&#39;s body 
writhed in anguish. Quickly Amy went back to work, she placed a splint 
on the girl&#39;s arms and wrapped it with the tape up as tightly as she 
dared. She had already stopped the bleeding from the knife wounds in 
Alyson&#39;s leg, and the arm turned out to be not as bad as she first 
thought. If Amy had not known Alyson she would have insisted that they 
send the girl to a hospital, but that could be the worst thing for the 
girl right now and Amy knew it. Plus there was the fact that Alyson 
seemed to heal a lot faster then anyone else at the Academy, Sort of 
like Natalie. She paused for a moment before tearing off another strip 
of tape and wrapping up the girl&#39;s arm, &quot;Can you sit up?&quot; Amy inquired, 
hoping that the girl could hear her through the pain. 

&quot;I... think... so...&quot; Alyson panted as she used her good arm to prop 
herself up and for the first time noticed her clothes lay in tattered 
remains around her, the left leg of her pants had been cut away all the 
way up to the hip and her shirt was hanging by one sleeve. Alyson froze 
in place at the sight and started to tremble. 

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Amy asked as she continued to wrap the girl&#39;s arm 
up. 

Alyson gazed up at Amy with fear in her eyes, &quot;Y... you... know...&quot; She 
stammered as she wrapped an arm around her body. 

Amy tore the tape off the roll and dropped it in the bag, &quot;I&#39;ve always 
known.&quot; She explained simply, &quot;About you and that brother of yours.&quot;

Alyson&#39;s lowered her head, &quot;Then... are you... going to throw me out?&quot; 
Alyson asked, her mind no longer on the pain.

&quot;Nonsense.&quot; Amy exclaimed fastening the last of the bandages in place 
and pulling out a piece of cloth from her bag and turning it into a 
makeshift sling, &quot;You have as much a right to be here as any of the 
other girls.&quot; She stated placing the sling over the girl&#39;s head and 
under her arm.

Alyson&#39;s eyes dropped to the ground, no longer able to look Amy in the 
eyes, &quot;But I&#39;m not a girl.&quot; Alyson explained softly. 

Amy took Alyson&#39;s face between her hands and forced Alyson to look her 
in the eyes, &quot;I am the doctor here and you are a girl.&quot; She stated 
bluntly, &quot;I know how it seems, but you are not a boy. Do you understand 
me?&quot; She asked sternly. 

&quot;Then Brother is right.&quot; Alyson remarked, &quot;I&#39;m just a monster.&quot; She 
began to slump to the ground when Amy caught her and straightened the 
girl up. 

&quot;You are no monster.&quot; Amy declared, shaking the girl slightly, &quot;I have 
seen the way the other girls look at you. They would love to look as 
good as you do.&quot; She placed a hand under the girl&#39;s chin and looked her 
in the eyes, &quot;You are beautiful.&quot;

&quot;But Brother...&quot; Alyson began to speak only to have Amy place a hand 
over her mouth. 

&quot;I would not trust that man if my life depended on it.&quot; Amy stated 
coldly, &quot;He is the true monster. He did this to you.&quot; She explained 
flatly, pointing at Alyson&#39;s arm.

&quot;Drake loves me.&quot; Alyson stated boldly, yet there was a slight amount of 
doubt in her eyes.

Amy frowned, &quot;I know all about his form of love and you can live without 
it.&quot; She packed up her things, &quot;I hope you are smart enough not to 
return to him.&quot; She remarked as she got to her feet, &quot;Anyway, you have 
Natalie now.&quot;

&quot;Nat...&quot; Alyson lowered her head as she remembered that last time they 
had spoke to each other was in anger, &quot;She will hate me if she ever 
found out.&quot; She stated miserably. 

Amy started towards the door, &quot;I think you do not give that girl enough 
credit.&quot; She explained, &quot;You should really try to talk to her. She was 
rather torn up when she saw you laying here.&quot; 

Alyson staggered to her feet, &quot;She was here?!?&quot; She used the bedpost to 
gain balance, &quot;What does she know?&quot; 

Amy glanced over at Alyson, &quot;Only that she thinks she is to blame for 
your wounds.&quot; Amy replied with a sigh, &quot;She really does love you.&quot; Amy 
turned the doorknob; &quot;You might want to try to let her in for once.&quot; 
With that she disappeared from the room leaving Alyson to sink into her 
bed and mill over her thoughts.
