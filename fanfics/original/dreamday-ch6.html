<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 6 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Mr. Gish carried a desk over his head and set it down next to Kris&#39;s, 
&quot;There you go.&quot; He said, smiling at Jennifer, then at Kris. The two 
girls stuck closely together after their first meeting in the washroom 
and Mr. Gish decided it would be best for the two of them to sit side by 
side. It was almost as if the teacher knew something that they didn&#39;t. 
After school was over, Jennifer followed Kris closely as she showed her 
new friend around the school. After a quick tour they returned to their 
class to gather their jackets and shoes before leaving the school. 

&quot;Ummm... do you live nearby?&quot; Jenn finally got up the strength to ask. 
She had not said much of a word all day long. She simply sat at her desk 
with her arms crossed over her stomach and her eyes low. 

Kris grabbed her jacket, &quot;Only a few blocks away.&quot; She replied, then 
started to look for the cubby hole where her outdoor shoes were kept, &quot;I 
like to walk around before going home.&quot; Anything to delay facing the 
fury of her mother, because she knew by now the school would have called 
to tell her about Kris&#39;s &quot;outbursts&quot;. Kris dropped her shoes to the 
ground and pulled off her indoor shoes. 

&quot;Oh,&quot; Jenn grabbed her own shoes, &quot;My mom doesn&#39;t like me being late. 
She worries a lot.&quot; 

&quot;My mother could not care if I was dead.&quot; Kris said bluntly, &quot;Sometimes 
I wish I was...&quot; She stopped herself to late, &quot;I mean...&quot; Kris tried to 
recover herself. 

&quot;I know what you mean.&quot; Jenn looked out the door. 

Kris stepped into her shoes, &quot;You do?&quot; She was now curious. 

Jenn turned to Kris and forced herself to smile, &quot;Can I walk with you 
for a bit?&quot; She asked. 

Kris gave the girl an odd look, &quot;I guess... I&#39;m not going anywhere 
special.&quot; She said grabbing her school bag. 

&quot;That is alright.&quot; Jenn said still smiling. The two girls pushed through 
the door out into the blazing sun. They squinted against the glare. 

&quot;Hey Kris!!!&quot; Tanya came running across the tarmac (a strip of asphalt 
that was laid out between the west exit of the school and a string of 
portables.) She was dressed in a green t-shirt and skirt with her hair 
cleanly cut short, &quot;Where have you been?&quot; She asked looking from Kris to 
Jenn, &quot;Who&#39;s the new girl?&quot; She nodded towards Jenn.

Kris nervously ran a hand through her hair, &quot;This is Jenn.&quot; She said, 
&quot;Sorry about lunch... I just... wanted to be alone.&quot; She lowered her 
head. Tanya had been her closest friend since she moved to the area two 
years ago. Usually Kris spent recess and lunch with the girl, however 
today she wanted to be along and then Jenn showed up. She didn&#39;t know 
how to tell her friend.

Tanya eyes Kris closely, &quot;Is that true?&quot; 

Kris looked at the ground, &quot;I...&quot; She hated lying to Tanya like that, 
but the girl tended to get jealous when other girls showed any interest 
in her. Everyone knew that Tanya, as did a few other girls in school, 
had a huge crush on Kris.

Tanya turned her attention on Jennifer, &quot;So you are Jenn. When did you 
move to Rose Vil?&quot; She inquired, &quot;What do you think of Kris?&quot; 

&quot;Tanya leave her alone.&quot; Kris said walking away from the girl, &quot;She is 
not like that.&quot; 

&quot;How can you be sure?&quot; Tanya blocked Jenn from following Kris, &quot;Maybe 
she has not found out all about you yet?&quot; 

Kris spun around and slammed Tanya against the brick wall, &quot;Will you 
shut up!?!&quot; She snarled. She sometimes wished that Tanya would keep her 
big mouth shut. Besides Tanya only a few others knew about Kris&#39;s 
budding interest in girls. Only Tanya seemed to truly understand which 
is why she told the girl, but now she was beginning to regret it. 

&quot;Why did you lie to me then?&quot; Tanya asked with hurt in her eyes, &quot;I 
thought we were close.&quot; 

Kris let go of her friend, &quot;We are... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kris looked around to 
see that Jenn was intensely watching the two girls causing Kris to step 
back from Tanya. She turned back to her friend, &quot;I was just showing 
Jennifer around the school, alright. I knew you would take it the wrong 
way... sorry I lied to you.&quot;

Tanya looked down as she brushed her shirt off, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She 
turned and ran away. 

&quot;Tanya wait!&quot; Kris called out. She started to run then remembered Jenn 
and turned to her, &quot;I&#39;ll be just one second.&quot; She darted after her 
friend without waiting for Jennifer&#39;s reply. 

Between the two friends Kris was the faster and had been part of track 
and gymnastics for years now. Kris saw her friend running across the 
front lawn towards the sidewalk. Kris ran along the side of the school. 
Jumping a small hedge and landed on the sidewalk that led from the 
street to the main doors. It didn&#39;t take her long to intercept Tanya, 
&quot;Will you stop!&quot; Kris yelled as she grabbed the girl by the arm. When 
she turned Tanya around the girl was frantically wiping away tears from 
her eyes. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Tanya said through the tears, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to... I 
didn&#39;t...&quot; 

Kris rubbed the back of her neck. She hated when this happened. Why did 
girl&#39;s have to take an interest in her when she hated herself so much. 
She wished there was a way around all of this. She sat down on a rail 
that ran along the front of the schools property, &quot;No, I&#39;m sorry. I 
shouldn&#39;t have lied.&quot;

&quot;I.. I...&quot; Tanya fell to her knees and grabbed at the sleeve of Kris&#39;s 
jacket, &quot;I&#39;m so confused. I don&#39;t know why I feel this way. You hate me, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;  

&quot;No,&quot; Kris held her friend, &quot;I don&#39;t hate you. I just...&quot; She had to 
think for a moment, &quot;I just don&#39;t feel the same way...&quot; The truth was 
she liked Tanya. A lot. Just not in the same way as she did for other 
girls. Kris saw Tanya more as a close friend she could pal around with. 
Not the type of girl she would fall in love with. She looked over her 
shoulder to see Jenn was standing at the corner of the school watching 
them. Kris turned back to Tanya. She didn&#39;t understand falling in love, 
but she thought she was starting to understand a little more. She stood 
up and pulled her friend to her feet, &quot;I don&#39;t hate you. How could I 
hate my best friend?&quot; She asked with a smile. 

&quot;Am I really your best friend?&quot; Tanya said letting herself be pulled to 
her feet.

&quot;Silly,&quot; Kris shook her head, &quot;We have been friends since grade two. Of 
course you are my best friend.&quot;

Tanya forced herself to smile, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I don&#39;t know what 
happened.&quot; She wiped the last remaining tears away. 

&quot;I&#39;ll see you at recess tomorrow, for sure, alright?&quot; Kris asked giving 
the girl a warm smile. 

Tanya forced herself to smile back, &quot;Okay.&quot; She then turned and walked 
away from Kris. 

Kris watched her friend cross the street before turning around to see 
Jennifer was still waiting where Kris had left her. She quickly ran back 
to Jenn, who was playing with the hem of her dress. 

&quot;Is your friend okay?&quot; Jenn asked wide eyed in curiosity. 

&quot;Tanya will be fine.&quot; Kris took one last look over her shoulder. She 
could see Tanya far in the distance as she disappeared around a corner, 
&#39;I hope she will.&#39; Kris thought to herself, than turned around and 
started across the tarmac. 

Jenn followed closely behind her friend, &quot;Are you okay?&quot; She asked with 
a note of concern in her voice. 

&quot;I&#39;ll live... I always do...&quot; Kris said with a sigh. She cut between two 
portables across a small field until she reached a sidewalk that cut 
along behind a row of houses. Kris would spend hours treading the many 
paths that spider web around the neighborhood. She would keep her eyes 
on her feet and just watch as the pavement rolled along under her. She 
was told the paths existed so kids could get to school easily without 
having to walk around all the houses. She didn&#39;t really care about the 
reason for their existence only that they gave her something interesting 
to do in order to stay away from home. 

Jenn continued to keep pace with Kris. Not uttering so much as a word. 
Occasionally Kris would find herself looking up at the girl. She could 
not find her voice to talk, so she simply stared wondering why this girl 
would follow her. It was like something just stole her ability to speak. 
Jenn didn&#39;t seem to mind the silence. She treaded on beside her new 
friend whilst watching the scenery pass by. Kris suddenly realized that 
she didn&#39;t even know which way this girl lived or if she was leading her 
in the entirely wrong direction, &quot;W...&quot; Kris tried to force herself to 
talk &quot;Where do you live?&quot; She finally managed to stutter.

&quot;Wauls Court.&quot; Jenn said not taking her eyes off the many trees that 
surrounded the paths. 

&quot;Wauls?&quot; Kris blinked, &quot;That is only two blocks from my place.&quot; Kris 
cheered inside at her fortune. 

&quot;Really?&quot; Jenn exclaimed excited by the idea of living so close to her 
new friend, &quot;That is great.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Kris said, a tiny smile escaped the corner of her mouth. Things 
seemed to be looking up for her for once. As she raised her head higher 
she noticed the path divided and she knew that this would be the point 
Jenn would be departing her side, &quot;This is your turn.&quot; She said half 
heartedly. 

&quot;It is?&quot; Jenn looked around and noticed that they had come upon a long 
road. Not far away she recognized the entrance to her street. She turned 
around and blinked at the path, &quot;I didn&#39;t know you could get to school 
this way.&quot; She said in astonishment. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kris replied looking back at the ground, &quot;The paths can take you 
anywhere.&quot; She shyly looked at the girl, &quot;I can show you a few of the 
short cuts sometime. If you like..&quot; She trailed off shyly.

&quot;Would you?&quot; Jenn clapped her hands together, &quot;That would be great.&quot; She 
did a little hop in the direction of her home, &quot;I&#39;ll see you at school 
tomorrow, kay?&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Kris gave the girl a small wave. 

&quot;See you Kris!&quot; Jenn waved back, than turned and ran towards her street. 

Kris stood very still as she watched Jenn bounce across the street. Kris 
could feel her heart pounding at the way the girl&#39;s long hair bounced 
along behind her. Jenn turned around once more to wave again before 
disappearing down the road. Kris took a long deep breath and told her 
heart to slow down. It didn&#39;t seem to work. The more she tried to stop 
it the more she though of the reasons why her heart was acting that way. 
The tiny smile broke out into a grin and she ran along the path towards 
her home. Before long the girl entered a small complex of two floor 
houses all set together in groups of six, three on either side of the 
other. Out front of each house one could see a small fenced off yards. 

Kris circled around the first block on the far corner. Until she reached 
the back door of her house where she carefully pulled her key out of her 
pocket and warily inserted the key in the door. She took a deep breath 
before turning the key and letting herself into the small house. At 
first Kris did not enter the building. Instead she just stood perfectly 
still and listened to the sounds from within it&#39;s walls. Just as she was 
about to step beyond the threshold a voice called out from the bawls of 
the house. 

&quot;Kris is that you?&quot; Her mothers voice echoed from the kitchen which was 
to the right of the door she was now closing. 

&quot;Yes mom.&quot; Kris spoke softly. Almost afraid to let her voice be heard. 

Her mother came around the corner from the kitchen.  The woman was short 
and very thin with long straight bleach blonde hair that ran down her 
entire back. Her face was wrinkled from stress lines and her eye had a 
deep set quality to them. She wore a pair of tight jeans and a brown 
shirt that showed how thin the woman was. A beer mug was in hand, which 
she was currently in the process of drying with a blue striped hand 
towel, &quot;How was school honey?&quot; Her mother asked cheerfully. 

This was always a tricky question. Kris never knew exactly how to answer 
for her mother always told her she never wanted to hear about Kris 
crying in school and yet she also told her never to lie. So Kris just 
stood like a deer in headlights. Her mind reeling over the question and 
the many answers she could give. She could feel her hand begin to betray 
her so she quickly hide them behind her back, &quot;It was alright.&quot; She 
finally managed to voice. Almost the moment she said the words she 
wished she could take them back. Her mother&#39;s eyes never left her&#39;s. 
They felt like they were burrowing into Kris&#39;s soul. 

&quot;Is that so?&quot; The woman slowly put the mug down on the counter and set 
the table cloth next to it, &quot;That is not what I heard from your 
principal.&quot; 

Kris began to back up. She was almost positive none of the other 
teachers had seen her break down and was confident that Mr. Gish would 
not have told on her, &quot;I... I just...&quot; How did her mother always seem to 
know when she slipped up. Kris tried to find a way to escape, however 
knew it was already to late.

&quot;So are you telling me that you lied to me?&quot; Kris could hear the strain 
in her mothers voice. It was like the woman was trying to restrain 
herself, &quot;I try so hard to give you everything you need and you always 
have to be so difficult.&quot; Her mother was now grinding her teeth and 
clenching her fist on the counter. 

&quot;Bu-&quot; Kris was about to protest when her mother suddenly threw the mug 
against the wall over Kris&#39;s head with such force that it made a hole in 
the drywall before toppling to the ground and shattering. Kris cringed 
against the sound of the glass. 

&quot;What is wrong with you?&quot; Her mother hissed as she approached the girl, 
&quot;You are no longer a child. Why do you have to keep giving me so many 
problems?&quot; The woman&#39;s voice rose with each question causing Kris to 
cringe further and further against the wall, &quot;All I ask for is a normal 
child. Lord why couldn&#39;t you have given me that?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Kris whispered. 

&quot;Your sorry?&quot; Her mother closed in on her, &quot;Your sorry?&quot; She struck out 
at the child and hit her across the cheek, &quot;You should have thought 
about that before making a fool out of me. I&#39;m tired of moving all the 
time so this is going to have to stop. Understood!&quot; She emphasized her 
statement by knocking Kris&#39;s head into the wall. She than grabbed the 
girl by the arm and hauled her to her feet, &quot;You are coming with me.&quot; 
She shook Kris as she dragged her down the hall than up the stairs to 
her room. 

As they reached the top of the stairs Kris&#39;s little sister stepped out 
of her room. Even though the girl was two years Kris&#39;s younger she 
looked almost Kris&#39;s age. She had long blonde hair, just like her 
mother, and wore small pink rimmed glasses. She blinked at the couple as 
they approached her, &quot;Mommy are you alright?&quot; She asked then looked down 
at Kris, who was trying
hard to stand properly, &quot;Is Kris in trouble?&quot; She inquired with her big 
green eyes. 

&quot;Get back in your room, Rebecca.&quot; Her mother commanded, &quot;Do your 
homework.&quot;

The girl didn&#39;t wait to be told a second time, &quot;Okay.&quot; She said turning 
around and slowly closing her door again. She stopped for a moment to 
take one last look at her older sister. The two girls exchanged a 
knowing glance. Kris nodded at her sister and gave the girl a weak smile 
before seeing the girl close her door. 

Their mother opened the door to Kris&#39;s room and tossed her to the 
ground. It was a small room with only a single bed, a tiny dresser and a 
desk with a overhead lamp. The woman grabbed the desk chair and pulled 
it out, than seized the girl by the arm and dropped her in the chair. 
She grabbed a pad of paper off of one of the desk shelves and a pencil. 

&quot;I want you to write &#39;I will never cry again&#39; five, no make it, eight 
thousand times.&quot; She slammed the pencil down on the pad and pushed 
Kris&#39;s head down over the desk, &quot;and I don&#39;t want to see you cheating or 
it will be ten thousand.&quot; She let go of the girl and stormed out of the 
room slamming the door behind her. 

Kris stared at the paper in front of her. She picked up the pencil and 
set the tip on the paper when she hear her mothers voice ring out inside 
of her head, &quot;Never EVER lie.&quot; Kris felt her hand begin to tremble. How 
could she possibly write something that she knew would be a lie? She 
couldn&#39;t just stop crying when she wasn&#39;t even aware of what caused her 
to cry in the first place. Her head began to hurt. A tear fell onto the 
paper. Followed closely by another and another. Kris buried her
hands in her face and let out a tired sob.
