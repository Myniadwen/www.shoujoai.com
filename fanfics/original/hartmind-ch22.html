<a href="../original/hartmind-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Summer came quickly and Sam was feeling more anxious with every passing 
day. Jasmine said she would help them, but even with an adult at their 
side she feared the worst. Only a week after school let out Star arrived 
in town and Beth, along with her mother, went to help them move it. Beth 
spent many summer days with Star, making sure she was all right and 
making her feel at home, leaving Trish with the chore of keeping Sam&#39;s 
mind off the girl. Trish kept at Sam&#39;s side the every day of the summer, 
trying hard to keep the girl busy and her mind off the fact that Star 
had moved in just down the street. Sam struggled with the urge to just 
pass by the house, just a peek, anything to get a look at the girl, to 
know that she was alright, but everyone insisted that she stay far away, 
for the summer at the very least, and Sam agreed, but that did not mean 
she did not want to see the girl. The fact that Star was in town made 
her long to see the girl more and more with each passing day and it was 
making Sam very impassionate. 

&quot;Can&#39;t I see her? Just once?&quot; She pleaded with the girls as they watched 
movies in the sub-basement living room. 

&quot;No!&quot; Trish replied firmly, crossing her arms to show that was the end 
of the subject. 

&quot;Just a small peek. I haven&#39;t seen her in such a long time. I just want 
to hear her voice, something.&quot; 

Beth let out a sigh, they had been through this several times that 
summer already and she felt sorry for the girl, &quot;You&#39;ll be able to see 
her at school.&quot; She reminded the girl, &quot;You just have to wait another 
month. You have come this far, can&#39;t you wait just a little longer?&quot; 

Sam let out a disgruntled sigh of defeat realizing she could not get the 
girl&#39;s to budge on the situation and turned back to the movie. 

Trish was like a hawk over Sam, never letting her eyes off the girl. She 
kept reminding Sam that they had to be careful and do as they planed or 
things could come out horribly, but all Sam could think about was 
finally being able to hold Star in her arms. She knew the girls were 
correct, but that did not stop her from longing to be with Star for 
real. She struggled with her urge to see the girl and prepared for the 
day that she would finally see Star in person. She was not even sure 
what she would say to the girl. It would not be a simple conversation 
that was for certain and as the August month crawled on passed she 
started to doubt their plans and worry that Star would reject her. She 
became so lost in her worries that before long Labour Day was upon them 
and that meant that she would finally get to see Star. 

Sam lay in her bed the night before the first day of school thinking, 
her mind filled with memories of that day she spent with Star and 
worrying over the fact that the day of her friend&#39;s death was coming 
closer by every minute, D-day was nearly upon her. She began to wonder 
where the word originated from and what it meant. &quot;Do or Die Day&quot; seemed 
the most appropriate to her and made her feel eve more miserable as she 
considered the fact that they could fail to save Star entirely, or even 
be killed themselves. She shook the thought from her mind as she tried 
to get some form of sleep that night. 

Trish and her rode to school early in the morning, so they could find 
their homerooms and class schedules, while Beth promised to take Star to 
school on the first day, to help her get acquainted with the school and 
not be so alone. They entered the building and pushed through the crowds 
on their way to the gym, where the class listings would be posted. Trish 
bounced around happily with news that they were in the same homeroom 
together. 

&quot;This is great.&quot; She squealed, &quot;We can go to class together, with Beth!&quot; 

Sam smiled back at the girl, trying hard to share the girl&#39;s enthusiasm 
however her eyes were too busy scanning the crowds for Beth and Star. 
She spotted Beth behind a couple of other girls, her dark appearance 
making her stand out in the crowd, and beside her she could see the top 
of black hair, &quot;There they are.&quot; She breathed, feeling her hands 
trembling as she tried to point the two girls out. 

Trish spun around and smiled at the sight of her girlfriend, then the 
crowd parted and she got a good look at Star for the first time, 
&quot;Awwww...&quot; She cooed, &quot;She&#39;s so cute.&quot; She exclaimed, &quot;So much prettier 
then her photos.&quot; She glanced up at Sam to see the girl was still 
starring at Star, a dreamy look in her eyes, and pulled on the sleeve of 
Sam&#39;s shirt, &quot;Alright lover girl, you&#39;ve seen her now lets get out of 
here before she sees the way you are starring at her.&quot; She commanded as 
she pulled the girl towards the rear exit of the gym. 

&quot;But... but...&quot; Sam half protested, not letting her eyes off Star. 

Trish pushed through the double doors and let them close behind them, 
and then turned to Sam, &quot;You have to control yourself.&quot; She reminded the 
girl, &quot;You can&#39;t just walk up to her and start talking with her. She 
doesn&#39;t know who you are yet, remember?&quot; 

Sam let out a sigh and nodded in agreement, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. You must think 
I&#39;m stupid for acting like this.&quot; 

Trish shook her head and smiled at her friend, &quot;It is kind of cute. If 
this all works out we are going to have some stories to talk about when 
we are older, aren&#39;t we?&quot; 

Sam gave half a smile, &quot;That is for sure.&quot; She agreed. Deciding to not 
confront Star just yet the two of them worked their way around the back 
of the school on their way to their homeroom. The bell suddenly rang 
announcing the start of the day and they rushed hastened their pace. The 
first day was never anything special. They visited their homeroom to get 
acquainted with their homeroom teacher, acquired their class schedules, 
which Sam and Trish noticed they had the same lunch hour as well as 
several of the same classes this year around, and be assigned lockers, 
and then go to their first days classes to get a list of materials they 
would need for the coming year. They arrived at homeroom to find Beth 
waiting in the room. 

Trish rushed over to the girl, &quot;Beth! I can&#39;t believe we have homeroom 
together.&quot; Squealed in delight.

Beth nodded and glanced around in embarrassment of her girlfriend&#39;s 
display of enthusiasm, &quot;It would appear so.&quot; She said happily, &quot;You want 
to share lockers?&quot; She offered with a grin. 

Trish frowned slightly and glanced at Sam who waved a hand to the girl, 
&quot;Share lockers with your girlfriend.&quot; She insisted, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine on my 
own.&quot; 

Trish gave Sam a quick hug, &quot;You&#39;re the best.&quot; She exclaimed and kissed 
the girl on the cheek. 

Sam flushed lightly, &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; She looked at Beth, &quot;I saw you with 
Star. How is she doing?&quot; 

Beth frowned slightly, &quot;She is scared. The whole new school thing and 
all of that. I told her I would take care of things here quickly and 
meet her at her homeroom as soon as I can.&quot; 

Sam smiled, &quot;Thanks for watching over her.&quot; 

Beth returned the smile, &quot;I would have done it no matter what.&quot; She 
state clearly, &quot;I told you she is like my little sister. I just hope we 
can keep her safe.&quot; She said with a frown. 

Trish looked at the schedule the girl held in her hand, &quot;Do you want me 
to pick up your material lists while you are with her?&quot; She offered 
politely. 

Beth gave the girl a surprised look, &quot;Would you be willing to do that 
for me?&quot; She inquired uneasily. 

Trish took the girl&#39;s schedule from her hand to look at it closer, 
comparing it to her own, &quot;Sure, we have some of the same classes so 
hitting up a couple of other classes will be alright. I&#39;ll tell the 
teachers you are helping a niner and they will understand.&quot; 

Beth hugged the girl, &quot;You are a dear you know that?&quot; 

Trish returned the hug, &quot;Anything for my love.&quot; She broke free of the 
hug and signalled to Sam, &quot;You coming with me?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Sam shrugged, &quot;Why not.&quot; She glanced at Beth one last time as they were 
leaving the room, &quot;Give Star a hug for me will you?&quot; 

Beth nodded, &quot;Will do.&quot; 

&quot;Later love.&quot; Trish said with a wave and blew a kiss at the girl and the 
two of them went on their way.
