<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/champions-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Battle Diva Rumble

The Battle Diva&#39;s Temple loomed ahead, but half the minds were focused 
on the past. BK Power, Siren, and G-Force were all thinking about the 
people they had met and infatuated over during the tournament, most 
notably Sally, who had gained her first real girlfriend since coming out 
to her parents. Merry Lynn Weathers, the woman with rancor. She was an 
enormous figure, easily dwarfing even some men, and had enough of a bulk 
to outfight them too. But she was goofy and casual, and gregarious to a 
point, even cute despite her appearance and name. Sally hoped they would 
see each other again, but for the moment, she was long overdue for a 
break.

Despite the girls-only rule of the Battle Divas, Thunder-Claw was riding 
with them&#151;if for no other reason, to bid a proper farewell to Sally and 
Xianq, two people he considered closest among friends. He also wanted to 
explore the temple and acquaint himself with the other Divas, but 
considering how solitary a few of them were, one task would be easier 
than the other. Father Jacob drove; the van was quiet in spite of its 
chatty passengers.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you,&quot; muttered Cobra to Siren during one uneventful 
mile. &quot;You&#39;re still pining over that wacko. From the way you go about 
it, you&#39;d think you wanted her to win!&quot;

&quot;Well, she certainly seemed capable,&quot; she noted. &quot;I did fight her, after 
all.&quot;

&quot;She looked like she was gonna kill you, and everyone else she went up 
against.&quot;

&quot;Probably just adrenaline.&quot;

&quot;Alyssa, the woman was a freak, plain and simple. Don&#39;t make excuses, 
especially for strangers, especially if they&#39;re psychotic.&quot;

&quot;How can you tell Pandora was a psycho?&quot; asked Father Jacob. &quot;In my 
mind, she seemed just as odd as any of the other fighters, including you 
all.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but we know when to restrain ourselves. And what was the deal 
with that roulette machine?&quot;

&quot;It might just remain a mystery,&quot; mused the old man. The road to the 
temple was long and barren, but they did make it, though it was evening 
when they arrived (and they had left early in the morning, the day after 
the tournament ended). The girls and the two men got out to stretch, 
feeling relieved to be back home again. Thunder-Claw graciously helped 
carry the luggage, even though Kris told him she could easily handle it 
all.

&quot;You can have mine!&quot; exclaimed G-Force merrily, so he took it. Learning 
about her preference in romantic pursuits was a surprise, especially 
considering how long the two had known each other. TC recalled being 
shot down mercifully after asking the blonde on a date, and now he 
thought he knew why. Maybe if he had been born a woman instead...

Well, not even then. G-Force was wild about older women, and though he 
had two years on her, it didn&#39;t seem like enough. Rancor had a whopping 
seven.

The team was allowed a peaceful rest that night, with everybody having 
their own room since the temple was so spacious. Each tried to dream 
about something, particularly loved ones; Siren just could not put 
Pandora out of her mind, no matter how hard she tried. Was it because 
the woman was tall, strong, and dressed sharp, albeit unusually? Was it 
because she respected her as a fighter, or maybe looked up to her? Was 
it just because she was &quot;weird&quot;, or &quot;forbidden territory&quot;, or for that 
matter, a woman in general? Regardless, Siren couldn&#39;t help but 
fantasize about Pandora the Gambler, and wondered when, if ever, she 
would see her again.

She wouldn&#39;t have long to wait.

Father Jacob rose with the sun, as he always did, and even though he 
usually trained his girls to exercise discipline and thus rise with the 
dawn as well, he figured he could give them a break since they had 
worked so hard the day before. He let them sleep as they willed, and 
personally vowed to take them all on a vacation, perhaps in a few days. 
The experience they had gotten from the tournament outweighed the money 
they won (in more ways than one), but they had new finances anyway, and 
plenty of ways to spend them. He would have to talk with Xianq about 
that later...

Everyone rose within the hour, most of them having been conditioned to 
wake at dawn regardless of the previous day&#39;s activity, and met in a 
large earthy dining room for some breakfast. They were just finishing 
the last bits of their meal when Father Jacob came running into the 
kitchen, looking stricken.

&quot;There are some familiar visitors outside, and they look quite hostile! 
We should go see what they want!&quot; Knowing him not one to be easily 
scared, the Divas took his advice, dropped their forks, and scurried out 
onto the foothills of the temple, none thankfully dressed in their 
nightgowns (though Cobra did complain about not being able to take a 
shower yet). A few sharp eyes recognized their visitors; some hairs 
stood on end as they all came into view. Sure enough, each one was a 
familiar face, and they numbered six in all.

Bloodbane. Wrath. Sanaa. Pandora the Gambler. Alia, the Harmonious 
Killer. Pride. These were the &quot;visitors&quot;, and it was plain by looking at 
the company they kept that this would be no warm social call; it was 
going to be a battle. Siren grimaced as she noticed the outstanding 
Gambler, recalling her desire to meet her again. Well, she had her wish, 
and then some.

&quot;I have to wonder what your lot is doing working together!&quot; exclaimed 
Cobra. &quot;Surely you&#39;re not all with that doctor?&quot;

&quot;For the time being, we are allies,&quot; snorted Wrath, muscular and 
vengeful. &quot;Many of us stake a claim in this battle, whether to soothe 
past wounds or to avenge prior defeats. Some simply wish to conclude a 
business!&quot;

&quot;And some,&quot; noted Bloodbane as she waved her ethereal hair from her 
face, &quot;have had no choice in the matter.&quot; She nodded once to Sanaa. 
Pandora, who appeared to be leading the villainous troupe, stepped 
forward.

&quot;Well now that the rules of the tournament no longer apply here, I can 
kill you all to my heart&#39;s content. The hard part will be deciding who 
dies first!&quot;

&quot;(See!)&quot; hissed Cobra as she nudged Siren. Alyssa just grunted.

&quot;I&#39;d rather spend my time with more important things,&quot; sighed Pride, 
&quot;but how could I pass up the chance to finish what I started&#151;eh, blue 
girl?&quot; He swaggered and grinned; G-Force cringed.

&quot;I shall just have my fun,&quot; said Alia, swinging her cane over her 
shoulders. &quot;Time to avenge my interrupted glee back at that burning 
village. A little six-on-six does seem to titter my tats.&quot; The two teams 
of six glared, and squared off against each other; apparently they 
really were going to fight! And so soon after arriving home!

&quot;What a disaster,&quot; sighed Thunder-Claw, &quot;but I guess it can&#39;t be 
avoided. En guarde!&quot;

Bloodbane found herself against Cobra once the dust settled. She was 
quick and had eerie powers, but was absolutely no match for the older 
woman. Cobra moved like an ice cube over grease, easily avoiding the 
slower, clumsier blood-weapons that the silver-haired woman thrust at 
her. Though fully human on the outside, with perhaps just a shade of 
green to her skin during battle mode, Mora Johsen fought like a true 
snake, quickly and wisely. She slithered and struck; she grasped 
Bloodbane tightly and squeezed, and when the woman forced more of her 
blood to form weapons, Cobra distanced herself and watched for an 
attack. Bloodbane quickly raised a large sword and rushed...

Siren found herself once again the bearer of Pandora&#39;s wrath, but this 
time was different: the Gambler&#39;s fate chose flamethrowers for her, and 
soon two columns of fire ejaculated from her bandoliers. Pandora laughed 
with sick glee as she slowly wheeled around, aiming the fiery spray at 
Siren wherever she went. The woman tried to fight back with waves of 
spirit energy, but apparently they were incinerated, so hot was the 
Gambler&#39;s blast. She figured she would have to get in close and fight 
with her bare hands, but...Pandora. It was Pandora. She could not... She 
could not help but feel...drawn to her. The woman was trying to kill 
her, for reasons still unknown, and yet...

Thunder-Claw was up against Sanaa, and how he wished he had been pitted 
against Bloodbane again! The battle between Rancor and the mysterious 
warrior underscored her talent; he had to push himself in every possible 
way just to survive another heartbeat. What a ferocious attacker! Sanaa 
moved like she was made out of water, and blasted him with such 
precision that he actually had to erect several lightning fields to 
absorb the blows. A few stray shots nicked his skin. The wound he got 
from that bullet awhile back started to sing in misery as it recalled 
previous pains; he hoped he wouldn&#39;t get hit in the same area twice! The 
man couldn&#39;t even stop; Sanaa was relentless, and just when he thought 
he had a clear shot...

BK Power buckled under the might of Wrath. She had fought him before and 
had lost, and now he seemed ready to finish the job. No matter what she 
threw at him&#151;including many things she literally picked up and tossed&#151;he 
seemed to take it in stride and come back even more powerful. It was as 
if he absorbed everyone&#39;s powers and added them to his own, which 
might&#39;ve explained his name. Kris found herself getting pummeled again, 
even at her highest level of power; Wrath was completely silent as he 
stood over her defeated body, lifting a boulder thrice his size with 
little effort, preparing to smash her into pulp.

Alia and Pride were an odd mix, but they combined their forces against 
Bubblegum Black and G-Force, whom they owed grudges towards. G-Force 
could easily fling Alia around with her influence over gravity, but 
every time she even glanced at Pride, she felt...insufficient, 
incompetent, unable to do anything. She felt utterly worthless and 
shamed, and the longer his presence affected her, the weaker she became, 
until she felt like giving up so...badly. Bubblegum Black was of course 
burdened down by that time; Alia could really deliver in the punishment 
category. She had Black on the ground, and scalpel in hand, giggled and 
murmured about how well she was going to enjoy the dissection.

&quot;Cobra! Rescue Power! The two of you gang up on the Gambler! I&#39;ll handle 
Pride and Wrath; the rest of you focus on Sanaa and Alia!&quot;

It was Father Jacob, who decided enough was enough, time to get in the 
fight and coach his team. He had fought all of the Divas before and had 
beaten them all, even BK Power, and knew how they operated. Only Cobra 
seemed to be excelling; everyone else was in a tough fight. Mora slapped 
Bloodbane away and rushed to rescue her comrades, leaving the 
middle-aged priest to charge into the fight. He stared down Bloodbane 
and produced a small firearm from his coat.

&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he stated as he shot her. Bloodbane screamed&#151;not from the 
pain, but from the insidious amount of precious blood she was losing&#151;and 
knelt down on the floor to recover herself. Pochanski then faced Wrath 
and Pride, and stood before them as a man of God, believing faith to be 
the only cure against such scum.

&quot;Your vengeance and conceited nature are no match against the will of 
the Lord!&quot; he screamed. &quot;You, Wrath, I destroy you with peace! You 
cannot avenge what has not been dealt! I give you no wound! Go, and 
writhe in the ground like a useless worm!&quot; Wrath snarled, but since 
Pochanski was only holding his hands out and shouting, there was no 
attack to draw his power from. And that stare...that fiery, iron-hard 
stare...it was even worse than his Master&#39;s. Whoever he was, that man 
knew what he was doing; he had seen Heaven and Hell and knew how to 
handle each.

&quot;Bah!&quot; Powerless, Wrath stormed away. Pride just smiled and tossed his 
hair.

&quot;And you, Pride! You come before a simple man who is humble, who is a 
servant! A servant! A man who works selflessly for others! Your powers 
are ineffective against me! Go back to the hole you were expelled from!&quot;

Pride hated being beaten.

Especially by an old geezer.

Especially if the old geezer did nothing but talk.

&quot;...Feh! I didn&#39;t want to be here anyway!&quot; And he too retreated. Father 
Jacob took a sigh, cleared his throat, and smiled. &quot;Well, it seems as if 
there is still a bit of pluck in me yet, thank the Lord. Now for the 
others!&quot; By that time, most of the girls who had been caught in deadly 
plights were now rescued, and as the villains fled (or were put out of 
service), they started to form together and cooperate. Sanaa had been 
winning until she found herself surrounded, but since she had no reason 
to be in the fight, other than a few inescapable debts, she decided to 
run and fight another day. She took Bloodbane with her.

&quot;Just you two left,&quot; muttered Thunder-Claw ferociously. Alia was still 
grinning, but Pandora looked upset. If Alia was able to help her, she&#39;d 
still have a chance, but if the wicked Killer were destroyed, she just 
might have to spin her wheel again&#151;just this once, to test her fate 
again.

&quot;Two is enough,&quot; she replied. The girls surrounded her on all sides; 
Thunder-Claw glared at Alia. They circled each other for a few minutes, 
staring at one another like hungry jackals, each one ready to kill. Alia 
leaped out first, singing brilliantly, and struck TC in the face, 
scarring his forehead&#151;but that was her mistake. No sooner did his blood 
start to drip down did Thunder-Claw power up for a fatal blow. Alia was 
suddenly struck with a sphere of lightning, point-blank range, directly 
in the ribcage. The blast instantly caused her heart to explode, along 
with most of her chest, and sent her hurling backwards as she screamed 
one last dirge and was gone at last.

Soma von Zomren, alias Pandora, cursed.

&quot;Shit.&quot;

She spun her wheel again. It landed on &quot;Retreat&quot;. So, luck was still 
with her...

&quot;I value my life more important than I value revenge,&quot; she muttered. The 
bandoliers shot out a cloud of thick fog, protecting her retreat. Once 
everyone could see and breathe again, she was long gone, and except for 
Alia&#39;s charred body, they were alone again. The girls plopped down on 
the ground, each of them exhausted, and even Father Jacob seemed a 
little winded. He managed to limp over to the heaving Thunder-Claw and 
pat him on the back.

&quot;Well done, lad. I think that is one death we can all justify.&quot;

A chorus of &quot;Amen&quot; echoed.

&quot;Now,&quot; he added with a sad chuckle, &quot;we shall need a vacation even 
more!&quot;

&quot;Here, here,&quot; said Mora. She pointed to the smoldering corpse nearby and 
asked, &quot;So what do we do with her? I&#39;m not sure we should bury her, but 
I don&#39;t want to leave it out for the vultures to pick clean. Shall we 
burn it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Pochanski. &quot;Villainous as she was, even she does not deserve 
such a fate. Surely this woman had a soul before it was twisted, so we 
must respect that. If nobody volunteers, I shall bury her, but I will 
not mark the grave.&quot; Everyone chipped in, of course, and by the time it 
was afternoon, Alia&#39;s body was in the ground and everyone was tired, 
starving, and sweating considerably.

And even though Siren hated her for it, Xianq Shou said it best:

&quot;What a way to start the day, huh?&quot;

----------

To be concluded.

G-Force: Wow, what a fight. Remind me to never get on Thunder-Claw&#39;s bad 
side!

Father Jacob: Will do. Well, it&#39;s about time everybody has their 
vacation, so I guess it&#39;s up to me to decide where we go. Sally, do you 
think your friend would like to come along?

G-Force: I hope so. Gosh, I miss her already! I guess it&#39;s love...

Father Jacob: Maybe. In the last chapter of the &quot;Battle Diva Saga&quot;, the 
girls each head out on a well-deserved rest&#151;and not just the Divas, but 
everyone else. Sort of.

G-Force: For those of you who have been patient, THERE WILL BE SHOUJO-AI 
IN THE NEXT CHAPTER, GUARANTEED!

Father Jacob: xx Caps lock abuse...

G-Force: Uh, whoops Sowwy...

Father Jacob: Next time, &quot;Even Superheroes Need a Vacation!&quot;

G-Force: Ain&#39;t that the truth...</pre>
