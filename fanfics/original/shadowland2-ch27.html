<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 27 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>Kimberly slowly awoke and stretched, &quot;Natalie?&quot; She scanned her 
surroundings to find herself sitting in the middle of grey cement floor 
with no sign of any walls around her. She quickly pulled the blanket 
around herself for protection, &quot;No... no... She muttered to herself as 
she searched for some sign of an exit from this new nightmare. Curling 
up into a ball Kimberly tightly closed her eyes, &quot;Please go away.&quot; She 
pleaded, &quot;Leave me alone. I just want to be left alone.&quot; 

No one responded, not even a noise could be heard in the darkness. 
Silence embraced the little girl as she huddled under the blankets with 
the scent of Natalie to keep her company. Something about that smell 
gave Kimberly a small amount of strength it felt as if Natalie was there 
with her in some way and this make her feel not as alone.

Slowly she uncurled, but kept the blanket held tight around her 
shoulders. Again she scanned her surroundings; still there was nothing 
to see. She glanced up into the darkness and noticed something off in 
the distance. High above her she could see a small square of light like 
that of a window. Excited to see any sign of escape Kimberly got to her 
feet and started towards the light. 

She was so busy watching the window that she did not notice the stairs 
that had appeared before her until she stubbed her foot on a step and 
stumbled over them. &quot;Oww!!!&quot; She cried out as she sat upon the stairs 
nursing her throbbing foot. She set a hand upon the black step, &quot;Why do 
you always show up when I&#39;m not looking?&quot; She asked the step in 
frustration. Standing to her feet Kim pulled the blanket around herself 
once again before ascending the dark stairs, cautious to make sure that 
none of them were going to disappear beneath her feet. 

After a time she finally reached the top to discover they lead directly 
to the small square of floor and across the floor was the window she saw 
before. Excitedly she ran across the room until she stood before the 
window and peek within. Kimberly was surprised to find herself looking 
into washroom. She glanced around and noticed that Jenn was in the room 
with her two friends, Tanya and Cherilyn. The girls seemed to be 
distressed by something Jenn was staring at. Kim moved to the other side 
of the window, straining to get a glimpse at what could be holding her 
friend&#39;s attention. The moment she spotted May her heart shank like a 
rock into the darkest depths of the sea as she recalled her last 
encounter with the demon girl. 

Kim shook her head in disbelief, there was no way that could be the same 
girl she encountered in Jenn&#39;s dreams. She saw the Sisters of Death take 
her with her own two eyes and she was sure of it. There was no way May 
could come back, could she? Or was that just another nightmare? Kim&#39;s 
fears quickly turned to concern for Jenn. She needed to find a way into 
that room even if it put herself in danger. &quot;JENNN!!!&quot; She screamed as 
she began to pound frantically at the window, &quot;JENN!! I&#39;m over here!!!&quot; 
She punched at the window with all her might, however all her shouts 
seemed to go unheard for none of the girl paid any attention to her.

&quot;M... may...?&quot; Jenn swallowed hard as her mind reeled over what she was 
seeing, &quot;I was told you died.&quot; She stated in dismay. 

Tanya waved her hand before Jenn&#39;s face, &quot;Jenn?&quot; She snapped her fingers 
in front of the girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;Come on snap out of it.&quot; she pleaded, 
however Jenn did not seem to respond to Tanya&#39;s presence. It was as if 
she was somewhere else. 

May shook her head, &quot;That is what they want you to believe.&quot; She 
explained bleakly, &quot;Haven&#39;t you figured it out yet Jennifer?&quot; She 
inquired gently. 

Jenn rubbed her head in bewilderment, &quot;Why? Why would they lie to me?&quot; 

&quot;Tanya...&quot; Cherilyn glanced at her friend with worry in her eyes, &quot;Is 
she really talking to May?&quot; She inquired, terrified by the very thought 
that there could be a ghost in the room. 

&quot;Because,&quot; May grinned at Tanya, &quot;They want to keep you in this dream. 
Keep you from me.&quot; She held out a hand to Jenn, &quot;We belong together. 
Can&#39;t you feel it?&quot;

&quot;This another dream?&quot; Jenn inquired in confusion, &quot;They told me that the 
other place was just a dream.&quot;

&quot;This is reality!&quot; Tanya cried out, &quot;Why can&#39;t you hear me? Jenn listen 
to me. Don&#39;t listen to her.&quot; 

Jenn&#39;s wrists twitched with increasing intensity, &quot;This can&#39;t be a 
dream. It&#39;s too real.&quot; She clenched her wrist in an attempt to keep the 
tingling feeling down, however the feeling was getting unbearable and 
she had to fight with the urge to tear the bandages from her arm and 
scratch at the stitches.

&quot;Good.&quot; Tanya smiled in the direction Jenn was looking, hoping that May 
could see her delight, &quot;She is fighting back.&quot;

&quot;I know it&#39;s hard too believe.&quot; May stated then offered her hand to 
Jenn, &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll show you the way home.&quot; She offered with a smile, 
&quot;Just come with me and I&#39;ll take all the pain away.&quot; 

*****

&quot;NOOOO!!!&quot; Kimberly screamed at the top of her lungs, &quot;Don&#39;t go with 
her!!!&quot; She cried out in frantically. She backed away from the window 
and turned to find a desk chair standing not far from her. Without 
considering where the chair came from Kim grabbed the chair and tossed 
it at the window. The chair spiralled through the air as if it were 
flying through mud, pin wheeling slowly through the air ends over end. 
The moment its legs struck the window it exploded in a flurry of rainbow 
coloured glass and feathers. The glass spiralled through the air and 
quickly formed a face that smiled at Kim. 

&quot;Get out!!&quot; The glass face commanded, &quot;Leave here feeble speck.&quot;  

Abruptly Kimberly was thrown off her feet and plummeted over the dark 
edge of the room. Her arms flailed about wildly as she fell through the 
air. Suddenly she woke up to found herself sitting upon the floor in 
front of Natalie&#39;s bed. Panicky Kim sprung to her feet and fled from 
down the hall.

&quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot; Tanya stepped away from her friend, &quot;May is 
dead. She can&#39;t be here.&quot; She remarked while searching the room for any 
sign of her ghost friend, trying desperately to convince herself that 
this was not really happening. However the more she listened to Jenn 
talk to the apparition the greater her worries for her friend became.

Jenn watched May sceptically, &quot;Why should I believe you?&quot; She inquired 
with as much calm as she could muster. She was unsure if May was telling 
the truth or not, but her wrist were telling her not to believe 
everything she heard. 

Tanya looked into her friend in the eyes, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t believe her.&quot; 
She stated coldly grabbing the girl by the shoulders, &quot;Why can&#39;t you 
hear me?&quot; 

May pushed Tanya out of the way as she moved in closer to Jenn, causing 
the girl to fall against the counter, &quot;I know it&#39;s hard to believe.&quot; May 
stated softly. 

Tanya got back to her feet and glared at the emptiness in front of Jenn, 
&quot;It&#39;s May alright.&quot; She snarled, &quot;She never liked me much and I can say 
I never liked you either, Bitch.&quot; She swung at where she thought May 
must be only to stumble into a stall. 

&quot;Even I was a little confused at first.&quot; May continued not even stunned 
by Tanya&#39;s attempts, &quot;It is true that I killed myself.&quot; She said as she 
raised her hands to show Jenn the deep cuts in her flesh, &quot;Same as you.&quot; 

Jenn shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m not dead.&quot; Jenn replied. 

Tanya was startled by what she was hearing, &quot;No... This can&#39;t be 
happening.&quot; 

&quot;Tanya...&quot; Cherilyn backed into the corner of the room, her eyes round 
with fear, &quot;I&#39;m scared.&quot;

&quot;Well not yet you aren&#39;t.&quot; May said, &quot;We are currently laying in a 
hospital and if you don&#39;t remember your body soon you will most 
certainly die.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you.&quot; Jenn protested, &quot;What if you are just trying to 
trick me?&quot; 

May stared at the girl with hurt in her eyes, &quot;Why would I try to hurt 
you? I&#39;m your friend. &quot; 

Jenn glanced down at her wrists, &quot;So if I go with you then I&#39;ll live?&quot; 
She inquired sceptically, &quot;Why should I believe that I&#39;m in the 
hospital?&quot;  

Tanya frantically glanced from Jenn to where she figured May was 
standing while backing towards Cherilyn, &quot;We need to find Kris...&quot; She 
stated anxiously.

&quot;Why would I lie to you?&quot; May replied, &quot;What am I to tell your mother 
when I don&#39;t come back with you? Hmmm?&quot; 

&quot;My mom...&quot;

&quot;Quickly!!&quot; Tanya grabbed Cherilyn by the hand and pulled her out of the 
washroom.

Kris and Natalie rushed towards the Eastern Dorms. Just as they were 
approaching the building they spotted Kai running in the same direction. 

&quot;Kai!!&quot; Kris called out to her little sister. 

Kai stopped in her tracks to watch the two girls approaching her, &quot;Kris! 
Did you feel that?&quot; She asked.

Kris stop in front of her sister, &quot;Feel what? Where have you been?&quot; She 
probed her sister. 

&quot;With Aunts Missy and Sophia.&quot; Kai explained then pointed at the upper 
floors of the Eastern Dorm, &quot;There was a wave of emotion coming from 
within that building. It hit me so hard I was knocked out of my chair.&quot;

&quot;I can feel it.&quot; Natalie remarked with a shudder, glancing up at the 
building, &quot;Where are the Head Mistresses, anyways?&quot; She inquired 
anxiously.

&quot;Aunt Sophia is trying to keep Aunt Melissa from leaving.&quot; Kai explained 
restlessly, &quot;So far she has managed to keep her at the house but it 
doesn&#39;t look good.&quot;  

&quot;Missy is leaving?&quot; Natalie was stunned by this news, &quot;How can she just 
abandon us?&quot; 

&quot;She claimed it had something to do with you.&quot; Kris explained in dismay, 
&quot;Something about you and Alyson.&quot; 

&quot;She just showed me the truth.&quot; Natalie remarked in confusion, &quot;Why 
would that make her leave?&quot; 

&quot;She wanted to tell you everything early, but wasn&#39;t allowed to so she 
blames herself for your suffering.&quot; Kai stated nervously staring at the 
building, &quot;A dark force is building up inside there and it is hungry. It 
wants someone in there and is ripping its way to her.&quot; 

&quot;Why do these things keep happening to us?&quot; Natalie asked in 
frustration, &quot;Can&#39;t we even have one day&#39;s rest?&quot;  

Suddenly the front doors of the building burst open and Tanya and 
Cherilyn came flying out of the building directly at the girls, 
&quot;KRIS!!!&quot; Tanya cried out in relief, &quot;We were going to call for you.&quot; 

&quot;What is wrong?&quot; Kris rushed over to her friend&#39;s side. 

Tanya shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; She remarked shakily, &quot;Jenn... 
she....&quot; 

Cherilyn stepped in, &quot;She is standing in the washroom. It&#39;s like she 
lost her mind.&quot; She quickly explained, &quot;She keeps talking to herself and 
will not snap out of it.&quot;

&quot;Talking to herself?&quot; Kris seemed confused. 

Tanya took a deep breath and swallowed, &quot;Not to herself... She&#39;s talking 
to May...&quot;
