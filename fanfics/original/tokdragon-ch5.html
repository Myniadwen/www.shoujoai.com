Pool Room 1A, Kakuri Isle complex

&#147;So that was how it happened, huh?&#148;

Yoko nodded &#147;Yes. I led him to the edge of the ring and I pushed him off 
using the new technique I developed.&#148;

Jun giggled like a child, kicking her legs in the water. Normally she 
didn&#146;t like swimming in a public swimming bath, nor did she like wearing 
a bikini while doing so, but this was different somehow. She and Yoko 
were the only two here. And they both had a reason to celebrate. They 
had both one all three of their matches, and made it into the thicket of 
this tournament. And so far, it hadn&#146;t been too much of a stretch. At 
least not for Jun. Yoko was sitting on the edge of the pool, watching 
the clear water ripple and Jun swim. She didn&#146;t feel much like swimming 
herself, her ribs were still a little bit sore from Ryoma&#146;s Rairyuuken 
technique. 

Jun ran a hand through her wet ginger hair. &#147;New move, huh? I can&#146;t wait 
to see it.&#148;

&#147;What do you mean?&#148; Yoko asked gently.

&#147;Well&#133;&#148; Jun&#146;s green eyes lowered to the water of the pool she was wading 
in. &#147;We both made it into the Semi-Finals, right? There&#146;s a good chance 
that we&#146;ll end up fighting each other. Unless we lose to either of the 
other two who qualified.&#148; 

Yoko closed the book she was reading. &#147;Who did qualify?&#148;

&#147;One guy called Xiangau,&#148; Jun continued, &#147;And another girl called Li 
Ming.&#148;

Yoko felt her heart jerk. &#147;&#133;Li Ming&#133;&#148;

&#147;Huh? Do you know her, Yoko?&#148;

How could she say no? She did know Li Ming. Probably better than anyone 
else. But that was so long ago. The days they spent training and 
practicing in the Asagawa Training Facility were fun, but Li Ming had 
turned her back on that. On Yoko. Maybe that was the reason Yoko was so 
desperate to learn the secret that Li Ming was carrying What was it that 
would make someone cast away their friends and home without qualm?

Jun gave Yoko a puzzled look, because she said nothing in return. &#147;Yoko? 
Is everything okay?&#148;

&#147;Yes&#133;&#148; Yoko shook her head.  &#147;I&#146;m fine, Jun.&#148; 

&#147;You better be! We&#146;ve still got a lot of work on our hands before this 
thing is over.&#148; 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Reinhalt&#146;s Room, Kakuri Isle complex 

Reinhalt sat calmly on his polished pine chair, a glass of brandy in one 
hand, and a smile on his face. Things were going so well with the 
tournament so far. It had already been made to the Semi-Finals without 
any sort of hiccup. Miss Keiko opened the door to Reinhalt&#146;s richly 
decorated room, with her trademark clipboard and frown. 

&#147;Mr Schwarzluft,&#148; She said as she entered, &#147;I have the data you 
requested.&#148;

Reinhalt took a sip of brandy before answering back. &#147;Good. Give it out 
to me.&#148;

&#147;Very well.&#148;

Miss Keiko pulled one of the papers from her clipboard and handed it to 
Reinhalt. The blonde man tossed his hair, took a sip of brandy, and 
grabbed the sheet of paper with his free hand.  He took a quick gander, 
the information on it interesting him&#133;

--------------

&#147;So these four are the finalists for the tournament, are they?&#148; 

Miss Keiko nodded to her employer. &#147;Yes sir. Yoko, Xiangau and Li Ming, 
the three Children of Gaia we managed to track down, all made it to the 
Semi-Finals I have been told that the Stone Egg is reacting to the Gaia 
power that is emitted when the three were fighting.&#148;

&#147;Good&#133;&#148; Reinhalt sipped some more brandy &#147;We were unsuccessful in 
finding the other five Children of Gaia, but the energy being given off 
by fighters we have should be enough. Soon, all I have worked for will 
be mine&#133;&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The following morning, Luncheon Hall, Kakuri Isle

The day after After getting so rest under her belt, and a bit of time to 
reflect and think, Yoko felt refreshed and strengthened. But nothing 
made her feel more energized than a good meal. And especially breakfast. 
It woke her up, got her active, and kept her that way. The digs for her 
dining break this time, were far more gorgeous than the dining room at 
the Asagawa Training Facility. The Luncheon Hall of the Kakuri Isle 
complex was beautiful. Crystal chandeliers,  rich white crockery and 
silverware, hand-woven throw-overs  for twenty circular tables seating 
four, this place was amazing. 

But, very quiet. Only two people were at the table eating, that was 
herself, and Xiangau. They were both sitting on a four-seater table, in 
a sea of other tables, and the silence between them was so 
uncomfortable, she felt as though she would burst. Every time she tried 
to open up conversation between the two of them, Xiangau either ignore 
her, or froze her out with a one word answer. It was obvious that he was 
not much of a conversationalist. But what could she really do? Maybe 
there was good reason not to try and be friends. They might be fighting 
each other later on, and in a couple of days time they&#146;d probably never 
see each other again anyway. 

&#147;How do you like the island?&#148; Yoko asked, attempting to break the 
tension.

Xiangau kept eating. &#147;It&#146;s fine.&#148;

&#145;Geez, what an isolated guy.&#146; Yoko thought. &#145;Where&#146;s Jun?&#146;   

Bang on time &#147;Hey, Yoko!&#148;

The girl of the spoken name shifted on her chair to look over at the 
encroaching Jun. Her arrival couldn&#146;t have been more welcomed. Without a 
third word, the redhead Judo girl took a seat next to Yoko by the chair, 
across from Xiangau 

Jun grinned at the set up of food waiting for her. &#147;Ooh! This all looks 
so gorgeous! Better than that slop I ate yesterday morning. I guess 
there are some perks for being a semi-finalist!&#148;

Yoko looked over at her friend. &#147;Where were you?&#148;

&#147;Training!&#148; She replied, snagging a croissant. &#147;The good gyms are all 
empty now that the other 28 participants have been eliminated. Now I can 
train without a bunch of sweaty beef heads around me&#148;

It was then that Jun noticed Xiangau. She stopped gathering her food 
together as she looked at him, silent and stern, eating is breakfast 
like a soulless android. &#147;Hey&#133; you&#146;re Xiangau, aren&#146;t you?&#148;

The man was slow to reply, as usual. &#147;I have no name. Xiangau is just a 
given. If you want to address me by that, then go ahead.&#148;

&#147;I hear you&#146;re pretty tough,&#148; Jun said with a smile. &#147;You must have had 
one hell of a teacher&#148;

Xiangau simply shrugged his shoulders. &#147;Possibly.&#148;

Yoko and Jun looked at each other. The expressions on their faces both 
indicated that they were equally puzzled by Xiangau&#146;s behaviour. He 
seemed so cold and distant, like he didn&#146;t even want to be here. Someone 
who made it into the tournament&#146;s semi-finals should have been more 
happy, right? Well not this guy, it seemed. Well it didn&#146;t matter at all 
to Jun. She had her mind on only one thing, and that was winning the God 
of Fighting title. The money was a bonus, but that title was what she 
was after. The two girls and the young man went back to their meals. 
Moment&#146;s later, a fourth figure appeared from the door at the far side 
of the room. Yoko was the only one who looked at that person. And 
instantly wished that she hadn&#146;t.

Li Ming.

The Asagawa-girl went back to her plate, looking away from her old 
&#145;friend&#146;. She still couldn&#146;t believe how much Li Ming had changed over 
these years. She used to be such a nice, quiet girl, maybe a little 
pessimistic, but still likeable. Now she was like a whole new person. So 
different the silent girl whom had been sent to the Asagawa Training 
Facility as a child. So different to the woman that Yoko had known&#133;

&#147;Hey!&#148; Jun finally looked up at the girl. &#147;You&#146;re the other 
semi-finalist, Li Ming, right?&#148;

The Chinese woman walked around the table, and sat on the remaining 
seat, the one next to Xiangau (who hadn&#146;t batted so much as an eyelash 
at her). Once she sat, she threw a gaze in Yoko&#146;s direction, and then 
took it over to Jun. 

Li Ming nodded &#147;Yes, I am. I look forward to the following matches.&#148;

&#147;Me too&#133;&#148; Jun uttered with a grin. &#147;I&#146;ll be counting that prize money in 
no time&#133;&#148;

&#147;We shall see.&#148; 

Li Ming began eating the food on the plate before her and the whole 
group ate. With Jun at the helm, some light conversation began, but 
mostly between herself and Li Ming. Xiangau was as quiet as possible, 
just like he always was, and Yoko had silenced herself as soon as Li 
Ming made her appearance. It was strange, but she really didn&#146;t 
understand how to act around Li Ming anymore. A good while after they 
ate, the door at the side of the room opened up again. All looked up, 
aside from Xiangau, and they were graced with the presence of Reinhalt 
Schwarzluft&#146;s private secretary, Miss Keiko. Miss Keiko walked over to 
the dining table that the four semi-finalists were sitting at, her 
clipboard in hand. Once she was there she placed a glass jug (with three 
pieces of paper inside it) on the table. 

&#147;Here,&#148; She said mildly. &#147;These will decide who will fight who in the 
semi-final match later on today. Take one out and read the number you 
receive. This will decide who you will face.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll go first.&#148; Jun offered She reached into the jar, titled her head 
to the left and withdrew one of the four folded pieces of paper. She 
opened it, then recited her number. &#147;I&#146;m No.4.&#148; 

Yoko was the second person to draw out a piece of paper. Hers was, &#147;No 
1.&#148;

Li Ming drew the last note. &#147;Looks like I&#146;m No. 2.&#148;

Miss Keiko nodded, knowing what the following matches would be. She took 
out a pen and began writing on her clipboard, then turned back to the 
seated group. &#147;Alright then. The Semi-Finals matches are as follows. 
Round one, is between Li Ming and Yoko Asagawa,&#148;

Yoko and Li Ming both looked at each other. It looked like current 
differences would be resolved via their fists. Miss Keiko continued.

&#147;And that automatically makes the second round between Jun Magami and 
Xiangau. The Semi-Finals will begin in three hours, in the semi finals 
ring of the island. Be ready, and feel free to train until it is time to 
fight.&#148;

Miss Keiko then left the room. Leaving the remaining to muse over the 
fights between them that were to come.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Semi Finals Arena, Kakuri Isle 

Yoko, Jun, Li Ming and Xiangau all waited around the Semi Final ring. It 
was 11.00, the designated time for the first match, which was to be Yoko 
vs. Li Ming. Jun wished Yoko luck on the sidelines, but Yoko didn&#146;t take 
much notice. She was too focused on her opponent to think of anything 
else. The Asagawa-girl walked up the pathway around to the steps that 
led up to the ring floor. Li Ming was already waiting for her as she got 
there. Yoko looked on at her. 

She had no trouble separating the old Li Ming from the new one. The old 
Li Ming had some caring light behind her eyes. Those eyes managed to 
uplift Yoko in some of her most trying times. The eyes of the new Li 
Ming had no light. They were cold, harsh and unforgiving Even while 
fighting to this moment, Yoko hoped that  she might find out why Li Ming 
had changed so much. But now she realized one thing; it didn&#146;t matter. 

&#145;She&#146;s made her choice&#133;&#146; Yoko tightened her fists, spread her legs, and 
got into a fighting stance, her eyes still on her opponent. &#145;The Li Ming 
I knew is gone&#133; that woman over there is not my Li Ming&#133; not my friend 
anymore&#133; no more&#133;&#146;  
 
Li Ming cast an unreadable face before getting ready. She pulled her 
left  arm up into the air, pressed the other one downwards, palm open. 
Her legs were apart but not wide, and her body swung gracefully from 
side to side with a small sway. For this event,  Li Ming had dressed in 
her Chinese battle dress, a long red and gold one, split at the waist 
downwards. As the two faced off, the flames of their energy appeared to 
anyone with spiritual intuition. Like Xiangau. With his calculating eye, 
he looked at their energy from the sidelines. Yoko&#146;s body burned with a 
bright blue, while Li Ming emanated flames of light purple. He could see 
their strength. And strangely enough, he felt a connection to that 
power. Something bound him to both Yoko and Li Ming, though he couldn&#146;t 
quite place the feeling. Or even why he had it. 

Li Ming spoke on the arena floor. &#147;Let the best girl win.&#148;

Yoko narrowed her eyes. &#147;She intends to.&#148;

That was it. Yoko ran forward, stepping carefully, watching Li Ming with 
calm eyes, then made her move. Li Ming pulled up her arm and blocked 
Yoko&#146;s following punch. A second came at her, that Li Ming sidestepped, 
Yoko&#146;s body shifting forwards. Li Ming dodged around to her side, then 
kicked. Yoko winced when Li Ming landed her blow, and hopped away to get 
a better view of her 

Yoko had actually forgotten how fast Li Ming was. She was so agile with 
such a limber body that hitting her would be hard. Maybe even harder 
than it was with Ryoma Taneda But what weaknesses did she have before? 
Yoko did remember that Li Ming had a hard time throwing energy waves, so 
stuck with Chi-infusion. Maybe keeping her at a distance would lure Li 
Ming out. That way Yoko wouldn&#146;t have to chase her and waste her energy. 
She could counter Li Ming&#146;s strikes and work from there.

Yoko moved back a few steps, and remained still. She grimaced, frowned, 
groaned and let her fists shake, gathering energy. Though it appeared 
she was gathering energy for a wave, it was intended for something else&#133; 
and Li Ming took the bait. An urgent look passed across her face, and Li 
Ming ran forward, charging Yoko. Li Ming lunged in and threw a palm 
strike in Yoko&#146;s direction Within a split second, Yoko grinned, then 
lulled her upper body backwards, below the attack. Her body span around 
quickly, her leg extended, and Li Ming groaned as Yoko&#146;s taped foot 
nailed her in the face. The Chinese woman stumbled away, while Yoko got 
back into a standing position, regaining her momentum She followed a 
shocked Li Ming, and landed a searing punch to her jaw, then drew back 
her other fist. Yoko thrust a second punch into Li Ming&#146;s stomach, that 
made the older girl gasp with its strength. Yoko grinned a second time, 
withdrew her hand from the other girl&#146;s gut, then jumped away, putting 
some distance between the two of them. 

Li Ming looked up at Yoko. She had improved.

&#147;I&#146;m still stronger than you, Li Ming.&#148; Yoko said confidently. 

&#147;That doesn&#146;t mean you have an advantage over me&#133; strength isn&#146;t 
everything. You need more than that to win this fight, Yoko. And I have 
to be the one to win it.&#148;

With a groan in her throat, Li Ming pulled herself up from the slumped 
position she had previously been in, then clutched her right fist. After 
waiting a moment, she stuck out the middle and index fingers of that 
hand. Li Ming looked over at Yoko, pulled back that hand, then ran 
forwards. Yoko was alert. She knew that Li Ming had to be up to 
something, by the fact that Li Ming was attacking her via an outright 
charge, and waited for the girl to reach her. When the Chinese brunette 
got close, Yoko tried to punch her. Li Ming swiftly swerved to the side 
and projected her hand at Yoko. She pressed the tips of her two fingers 
against Yoko&#146;s shoulder. Yoko winced in pain. The marble-eyed girl 
grabbed her shoulder, out of reflex, and vaulted backwards before Li 
Ming got the opportunity to strike again Yoko stopped moving when she 
felt herself at a comfortable distance, but lowered herself to one knee, 
feeling pains in her upper leg and chest, beneath her bosom 

&#147;What&#146;s happening&#133;?&#148; Yoko said to herself. &#147;It feels like I was struck 
in three places&#133;&#148;

Over by the side of the ring, Xiangau was watching intently. &#147;Hmm&#133; the 
Three Point Blow.&#148;

Jun looked over at him. &#147;The what?&#148;

&#147;The Three Point Blow,&#148; Xiangau repeated. Normally he was a quiet person 
but when it came to martial arts he was more than willing to speak, &#147;It 
is a trademark move of the Hao-Mo-Lai denomination of Kung Fu. By 
striking a specific nerve in the body, the user can triple the damage 
done. It&#146;s a special ability because it doesn&#146;t require Chi-infusion.&#148;

That made Jun worry. &#147;That means Li Ming can use that move throughout 
the entire match with out running out of energy&#133;?&#148;

Xiangau just nodded. While in the ring, Yoko was stunned. She had never 
seen Li Ming use an ability like that before. And what was worse, was 
that it could happen again and again. What could she do to avoid 
something like that? With Li Ming&#146;s speed advantage, it would be a 
nightmare avoiding it for long. 

Li Ming sighed reluctantly, pushing her left foot forward. She clutched 
both her fists again, and shot out the index and middle fingers on both 
hands, preparing to use the Three Point Blow on her adversary once 
again. It was the technique she used to take out the other people she 
had fought in this tournament, and it looked like Yoko would fall to it 
as well.

&#147;I have to proceed, Yoko,&#148; Li Ming said. &#147;I cannot let you win.&#148;

Now Yoko actually started doubting herself. What could she do to fight 
against something that could knock her out three times as quickly? Li 
Ming came at a worried Yoko again, steam rolling in with strong 
determination. She raised her nimble hands and darted at Yoko. The girl 
struggled to avoid each stab-like strike, one after the other. Li Ming 
kept thrusting and darting, till, she landed a blow on Yoko&#146;s upper arm. 
Yoko grunted, and winced all the same, and through the confusion she was 
hit again in the ribcage. Yoko ambled back with the sensation of being 
hit in so many places, while Li Ming watched her move backwards. To her, 
the fight had already been won.

Yoko fell to her knees again. Her legs, head, chest and ribs all felt 
sore. And she had only been hit by Li Ming&#146;s Three Point Blow on three 
separate occasions She had to do something quick or she&#146;d be 
overwhelmed. 

&#147;Two more,&#148; Li Ming said. &#147;Two more hits with the Three Point Blow and 
this is over.&#148;

The younger girl just barely got back up to her feet in a standing 
position. There was a bruise on her arm. It looked like the Three Point 
Blow had done its damage there more than once. Li Ming was right. Just a 
couple more shots by that technique of hers would end this. There had to 
be something that Yoko could do to fight against that ability. Li Ming 
shot off from her standing position into a run, straight for Yoko The 
Chinese woman narrowed down on the Asagawa-girl, though she didn&#146;t move 
a muscle.

&#147;Yoko!&#148; Jun cried from the sidelines. &#147;Get out of her way!&#148; 

But she didn&#146;t move a muscle. That was until Li Ming thrust her hand at 
her. Yoko&#146;s eyes glinted as she dodged the move, then cried out as her 
fist exploded with bright orange flames. Both Xiangau and Li Ming were 
surprised by the sudden projection of Chi, but Li Ming was the one who 
felt it first hand, in the form of a brutal punch. Yoko&#146;s flame covered 
fist collided with the ribs of the Chinese opponent, and a flash of 
light passed through the scene. The force of the punch pushed circling 
wave of dust away from the two of them. Li Ming coughed up spittle and 
felt her air being stolen from her lungs. Yoko quickly pulled her fist 
back and hopped in place, swinging her leg Li Ming was struck in the 
ribs by Yoko&#146;s kick, and pushed back, out of striking range. Yoko still 
moved backwards, despite that, and brought her guard back up. 

&#147;Alright, Yoko!&#148; Jun cried happily. &#147;Keep it up!&#148;

Xiangau watched on, bathing in his thoughts. &#145;Impressive. She had been 
gathering energy right through this altercation. But that cannot protect 
her forever&#133;&#146;

Li Ming was even more concerned. &#145;Damn&#133; I had no idea that Yoko had some 
Chi-infusion techniques&#133; under her belt. Did Nobuo teach her that? I 
suppose it doesn&#146;t matter. I cannot let Reinhalt get his hands on Yoko. 
I have to defeat her to protect her&#133;&#146;

&#147;Get ready, Yoko!&#148; Li Ming yelled. &#147;To witness the power of Hao-Mo-Lai 
style!&#148;

Yoko kept her guard up and her doubts down as Li Ming straightened 
herself out. The Asagawa Fist technique was still only experimental, 
there was no way she could rely on it, but for now it was the only 
special ability she had that was of use in this situation. Li Ming was 
so fast that hitting her with an energy wave just couldn&#146;t happen. The 
Asagawa Fist was quite possibly the only thing that could help her win. 
The Chinese woman across the ring stood firm. She narrowed her eyes and 
gripped her feet to the ground, her limbs shaking with momentum. Her 
breath grew quick, her hair thrashing in the wind. And before long, both 
Yoko and Xiangau could see Li Ming&#146;s amethyst spiritual power rise up 
around her. 

&#147;Ha!&#148; Li Ming yelled, crossing her arms over her body. She pulled them 
back to her sides, and a dark flash surrounded her body. By the time her 
body eased, Yoko was confused as to what Yoko had done. It seemed like 
she had done nothing at all. Until, that is, Yoko looked around. And 
realized that there were more than two people in that ring now. 

Yoko&#146;s head rolled from side to side. And she could not believe what she 
was seeing. Li Ming in four places. One in front, one at her right, one 
on her left and one behind. She looked at the three behind and at her 
sides. They resembled her, but were clearly made from Li Ming&#146;s 
Chi-flow, which was limited. Their purple, willowy and hollow 
appearances proved that. Over at the side of the ring, Jun was shocked, 
bamboozled, and mightily confused. 

&#147;What the hell?&#148; She uttered, &#147;Did Li Ming just&#133; copy herself?&#148;

Xiangau crossed his arms. &#147;The Shadow Fake technique. They are just 
illusions Fragile Chi projections created by merging the power of the 
mind with that of one&#146;s Chi-flow. They can&#146;t even hurt her&#148;

&#147;So why did Li Ming bother to create them?&#148; Jun asked

Xiangau kept his eye on the ring. &#147;You&#146;ll see.&#148;

It was hard, but Yoko circled her body around to keep her eyes on all of 
the Li Ming doubles Each of them looked poised to strike. 

&#147;There would be no way to counter all their attacks.&#148; Yoko said to 
herself.  &#147;And if they use the Three Point Blow&#133;&#148;

They didn&#146;t wait for Yoko to think of the outcome. Three of the shadow 
copies ran forward at Yoko, all preparing for attack. As they came at 
her collectively, Yoko jumped into the air with the utmost speed, 
souring above the clamouring group of copies. But when she did that, the 
real Li Ming came out of nowhere and landed a Three Point Blow to the 
arm, mid-air. Yoko gasped and was landed back to ground level, her feet 
stumbling, feeling the effects of Li Ming&#146;s technique. But when she 
looked over at Li Ming and her shadow copies, she realized that they 
were wavering. As was Li Ming. Her breath was growing hard, her chest 
rising and falling, sweat running down her cheeks. 

&#145;The move must be putting enormous strain on Li Ming&#146;s energy...&#146; Yoko 
thought privately.  

The Japanese girl pulled her fists back up, and narrowed down on Li 
Ming. She closed her eyes, and concentrated. By reflex, Yoko was 
compelled to fight against the shadow copies But she had to risk the 
assumption that they would not be able to hit her. She wouldn&#146;t look or 
sense for them, she would keep her eyes shut and use something else. 

Li Ming watched Yoko. She had closed her eyes. &#147;She probably thinks she 
can sense only me, if she doesn&#146;t look at the shadow copies. But she&#146;ll 
sense them anyway. I&#146;m sorry, Yoko But I have to win this fight&#133;&#148;

All four charged Yoko, the shadow copied Li Ming&#146;s and Li Ming herself 
But Yoko remained still as statue. They all gathered around her, and Li 
Ming drew back her hand for the final Three Point Blow. As expected, 
Yoko did attack. There was a flash of action between all parties 
concerned, but ended just as quickly. From the outside of the arena, 
both Jun and Xiangau were shocked to see what had taken place. A 
weakened Li Ming flopped limply off the foot of a tense Yoko.  She 
nailed the real Li Ming, with one sharp roundhouse kick. Li Ming 
blinked, sighed, then passed out, falling in a lifeless heap on the 
ground. The shadow copies all dissolved along with the sleeping Li 
Ming&#146;s concentration. She was defeated.

The intercom came back on. &#147;Winner&#133; Yoko Asagawa.&#148;

Xiangau smiled at Yoko. He was actually impressed. &#147;She ignored the 
shadow copies. She tricked the Chinese woman into believing that she 
would tell the difference via her senses, which would not have worked, 
but instead she must have deduced the real one via the wind resistance 
between their bodies. Tricking the user of a confusion technique like 
the Shadow Fake&#133; very impressive.&#148;

For the first time in years, a fighter was re-kindling his fighting 
spirit. Defeating Jun was that much more of an importance for him. Over 
in the ring, Yoko ran over to the downed Li Ming. She got on her knees, 
and wrapped her worried hands around the back of Li Ming&#146;s head and her 
neck. 

&#147;Li Ming! Li Ming!&#148; Yoko cried concernedly,  &#147;I&#146;m sorry! Please be 
okay&#133;&#148;

Jun walked over from the edge and climbed into the ring. She made her 
way over to Yoko and Li Ming, crouching down to get a better look at the 
damage. It looked like she fainted due to the strain of the Shadow Fake. 
What would make someone go to such lengths to win a fight?

&#147;Yoko.&#148; Jun turned to her. &#147;Take Li Ming back to the complex. I think 
she&#146;ll be okay if she gets some  rest.&#148;

Yoko looked back. &#147;But&#133; what about you? Your fight is next&#133;&#148;

&#147;Hey! This is Jun Magami you&#146;re talking to! I can handle myself without 
a cheerleader. You don&#146;t worry about a thing. As soon as I beat that 
Xiangau guy,  I&#146;ll catch up with you two.&#148;

In moments, the sleeping Li Ming was being carried back to the complex. 
Jun watched as Yoko (assisted by some of the KAIGA Group personnel) took 
Li Ming back toward the safety of the Kakuri Isle complex. In next to 
nothing, they were gone, vanishing into the thickets of wood that the 
dirt path pass through into. The red-haired girl tossed some of that 
hair over her ear, then casually looked over at her opponent, Xiangau He 
had already jumped onto the platform for action. She hadn&#146;t seen him in 
action yet, but it seemed that he was fairly skilled. After all, though 
the match with Li Ming and Yoko, he was offering play-by-play for all 
the nitty-gritty techniques on display. If this man was well versed in 
martial arts, there was no telling what his level of skill was.

Jun, this time dressed in her full fledged fighting outfit, pale blue Gi 
with sheared armholes, a black belt around the waist and two Japanese 
geta sandals on her feet. She pushed her legs apart, kept her hands and 
limbs loose, watching Xiangau firmly. 

&#145;He&#146;s fairly bulky,&#146; Jun thought slowly, &#145;That&#146;s exactly what I was 
expecting from the guys in this tournament. But I have to be cautious. 
If Xiangau made it this far, he&#146;s probably going to be a bit of a 
challenge.&#146;

&#147;Lets get this over with.&#148;  Jun said commandingly 

Xiangau did not do as Jun did, by assuming a fighting position. Instead 
he remained as he had been before, cold and still, reserved and calm. It 
looked like arrogance in some respects, for someone to not even put up 
their guard, but to Jun, it was Xiangau&#146;s way of being just a teeny bit 
overconfident. But there was a glint in Xiangau&#146;s eye that put that 
notion into question Jun remained blissfully ignorant of that glint as 
she ran at him, making the first move. Jun growled fiercely and thrust 
her fist at him, straight from her stride 

However Xiangau was not the least bit intimidated by Jun&#146;s fierce 
charging attack. And shortly, Jun would learn why.
