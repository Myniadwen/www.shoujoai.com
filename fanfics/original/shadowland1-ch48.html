Raggedy Terrors

Natalie took a step backwards, &quot;Was it just me or did the forest just 
close up around us?&quot; She asked nervously. She turned around to find she 
was entirely alone, &quot;Hello?.&quot; Her mind reeled as she tried to piece 
together what exactly happened and how she was going to get back to her 
friends. She felt a cool breeze brush against the back of her legs 
causing her to spin around. Suddenly she was no longer surrounded by 
trees as four long white walls rose up around her, two long massive 
walls and two shorter ones creating a very thin rectangular room, the 
width of which could not have been over ten feet, while the length 
spanned five times that. A roof was the last thing to slide into place, 
blocking out the last of the sun. Natalie spun around as the room 
started to take on more personality. Windows began to open up here and 
there and a long patio window formed on the far wall as the walls 
themselves turned a stained yellow and a hallway, merely a few feet in 
width, opened up in the corner of one of the smaller walls. Then, slowly 
furniture started to appear, melting out of the ground. A sofa, night 
table, television first materialize in the centre of the room. A small 
kitchen formed next to the hallway behind her and lastly long curtains 
rolled out from the ceiling covering all the windows. 

Natalie stood in amazement as the room came to life; soon she realized 
that she was standing in the mobile home that she used to live in with 
her mother. She had forgotten all about the place and ran to the patio 
window to see a long wooden porch extended along the entire length of 
the home. A barbeque could be seen against the rail where Natalie 
remembered enjoying roasted hotdogs that her uncle used to make, her 
mouth watering at the thought of the taste. A small plastic jungle gym 
sat down in the yard with grass growing around it due to it never being 
moved. Other mobile homes could be seen lined up along a dirt road and 
she suddenly remembered that Kimberly used to live just down the street 
and they would spend time together every now and then. Natalie smiled at 
the sights and memories, Placing her hand upon the patio door&#39;s handle 
to step outside when the suddenly television snapped to life and the 
room filled with the distinct sounds of Raggedy Ann and Andy: A Musical 
Adventure. She remembered the songs so clearly for she and her cousins 
would watch it every time they came over to visit during the autumn 
season. 

Natalie crept around the living room to get a closer look and as she 
suspected there was that same old raggedy camel singing about how sad he 
was. Natalie watched for a moment when a sense of dread began to 
overflow her mind. She glanced around in search of what could have 
caused this uneasy feeling, however there was no one about. Not even the 
usual sounds could be heard, no neighbour&#39;s barking dog, cars driving 
by, or even children playing outside. Still she felt something was 
watching her. Then the volume on the TV started to rise until all she 
could hear were the sounds from the show. When she turned back to see 
what was happening Raggedy Ann and Andy were up against a giant sea of 
toffee. The sight of the monstrous blob made Natalie take a step away 
from the TV, almost as if the creature could see Natalie&#39;s movements it 
turned and watched her. Its big eyes stared out of the television gazing 
directly at Natalie, causing the girl to creep backwards even further 
away. She found she could not take her eyes off the TV as the blob moved 
closer and closer to the screen. Never did it once take its eyes off of 
the girl. It pressed up against the glass of the tub and Natalie was 
almost certain she could hear it tapping on the surface, trying to break 
out. Bits started to ooze out of the side of the tub and run down the 
screen as the creature pushed harder upon the glass. It let out a 
gurgled cry of frustration as it tried to break free of it&#146;s confides. 
Further and further Natalie backed until she was up against the fridge 
in the corner of the kitchen. Her legs felt weak and she fumbled for the 
daggers she usually kept in her sleeves, trying desperately to find 
something to defend herself from that hideous abomination that was 
seeping from the television.

&quot;Naaatttalieeee...&quot; The creature hissed, still watching her.

Natalie tried to ignore the sound as she discovered that none of her 
throwing daggers where upon her person. She opened her jacket and 
searched the inner pockets; even her arm-mounted blade was missing. She 
could hear drops of the blob hitting the ground as she frantically 
searched her jacket. With a sigh of frustration she hit her head upon 
the fridge, feeling something warm and wet coat her hand and slowly 
turning around to find bloody handprints had appeared across the 
refrigerator. Her eyes moved to her feet where more blood had formed at 
her feet, pools of it seeping out of the floorboards in the shape of a 
human body. Abruptly her mind was filled with images of torn limbs and a 
shadow slowly creeping up upon her. Fear swelled inside of her heart as 
the memory of that dreadful night started to form inside her head, a 
night filled with murder and rape, her rape. She shook her head and 
screamed out as the nightmare took on a clearer form in her mind and 
then her eyes spotted something atop of the fridge, a set of kitchen 
knives. Hope rose in her heart at the gleam of those silver blades and 
she jumped to her feet and reached out for the knives, grabbing the one 
with the largest handle. Holding the blade in hand she felt confidence 
move through her fingertips as she scanned her surroundings once again, 
read to take on any adversary head on. That small ounce of hope and 
courage sunk to the pit of Natalie&#39;s stomach when her eyes set upon what 
was standing before her. 

&quot;Hello again Cousin.&quot; A tall figure hissed. Natalie found it hard to not 
let the knife slip from her hand. The man before her was tall and wore a 
black cloak with hood pulled over his head leaving only half his face 
visible. The lower portion of the cloak seemed to become more shadow 
than solid and parts of it melded with the shadows around his feet. He 
tilted his head and smiled at the girl, &quot;You remember me, little girl?&quot; 
He said with a grin that sent Natalie&#39;s heart racing in terror. 

&quot;G... get away from me!!!&quot; Natalie screamed, waving the knife in an out 
stretched arm, &quot;Leave me alone!&quot; 

&quot;When I first saw you the other day I didn&#39;t realize it was you.&quot; The 
man placed a hand upon his chin, &quot;Strange coincidence, wouldn&#39;t you 
say?&quot;

&quot;I killed you, Akaime!&quot; Natalie snarled, &quot;You are dead. How many times 
does it take for you to stay dead?&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;m like a bad penny that keeps cropping up.&quot; Akaime admitted 
with a sly grin, &quot;This time I am not sure how I came back, maybe it was 
thanks to my new friends.&quot; He pulled off his hood revealing that a 
porcelain mask concealed the upper left side of his face, concealing his 
cheekbone to the top of his head. A glowing red eye could be seen from a 
narrow slit in the mask that was off centre on his face. When he turned 
his head it became apparent that the parts the mask only covered the 
front portion of his face and what was behind the mask was entirely 
missing. Natalie could see a large hole in the side of the man&#39;s head 
allowing Nat to peer deep inside of him, which seemed almost hollow. As 
if his flesh was nothing more then a shroud covering darkness. Then 
Natalie realized that the mask was not hiding the hole, his skin was 
concealing the mask and had been torn away leaving it hanging in places, 
revealing his true nature to be seen. Another smaller hole could be seen 
in the side of his neck. He tapped the mask with a finger, &quot;I still need 
to repay you for this little pain you caused me.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Natalie shook her head in disbelief, &quot;This can&#39;t be happening, 
this can&#39;t-be-happening!!!&quot; Suddenly Natalie realized that this was the 
same man that was chasing Kim and Jenn through the alleys. At a distance 
he appeared to be just another shadow and now that she knew who it was 
beneath that hood she was not sure she could have fought him off so 
easily again.

&quot;Oh trust me it is.&quot; Akaime said with a sinister smile, &quot;And in this 
place I&#39;m not the weakling I was before.&quot; He quickly knelt to the 
ground, placing a hand upon the floor. Flames burst from his fingertips 
creating a circle upon the carpet that filled in and began to grow in 
size. Natalie watched in fear as the flames begin to take on a new 
shape. The fire didn&#39;t seem to actually burn the floor as it grew in 
size; it more twisted and took on the likeness of a clear membrane that 
rose to the roof of the building. The blazes appeared as if it was being 
projected upon the surface of some kind of skin stretched over a 
writhing creature and something unexplainably vile began to move beneath 
its surface. Teeth could be seen shifting and snapping to free itself 
from its confines. Natalie pressed up against the wall to distance 
herself from the creature before her. A smell of something sickening 
burning filled the air that made Natalie want to throw up. The cocoon 
broke open to reveal a large set of jagged teeth; the rest of the 
membrane formed itself into a monolithic dog with flames leaping off its 
body like ragged fur. Natalie did not move as the dog leapt forward and 
charged at her. Suddenly she screamed and tossed the knife at the 
creature before breaking into a run down the hall. The creature was so 
big that its shoulder got stuck on the wall as it snapped viciously at 
the girl&#39;s heels. 

&quot;You can&#39;t escape me!&quot; Akaime called out after the girl, &quot;You will be 
mine. Along with all your friends.&quot; His maniacal laughter could be heard 
throughout the house.  

Natalie burst out of the mobile home and jumped a fence, hoping that she 
could find her friends before that monster did.
