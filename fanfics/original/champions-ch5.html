&quot;This whole thing started when I was born,&quot; said Kailin, kicking the 
dirt on the ground. &quot;I guess like you, I was born with my power. The 
proper term is pyro-something, pyro-kinna, I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Pyrokinetic,&quot; offered Rin.

&quot;Right, pyrokinetic. I wasn&#39;t exactly in control of my power, I never 
was. I used to set fire to everything, even myself. It just flared up, 
excuse the pun, so often that I thought I was cursed.&quot;

&quot;I can imagine that,&quot; murmured Rin. Kailin cast her face down, tapping 
her feet on the ground.

&quot;Now, of course, as you&#39;ve seen, I have better control. I can make it do 
almost anything, and it usually appears on command. Of course, I&#39;m still 
not that good, and the fire is always going to be the master until I 
learn how to extinguish it. All I can do now is make the flames go lower 
and smaller, and stamp it out with something. Or let my target worry 
about it.&quot; She giggled, aiming a big cute smile at Rin&#39;s direction. Rin 
smiled placidly and asked her to continue.

&quot;Obviously, that&#39;s not the end of my story. You know those guys who were 
after me? They were part of a military group that...uh...I guess you 
could say they wanted to test me out and see how they could get my 
power.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s greed for ya,&quot; muttered Rin, herself scratching in the 
dirt as the last of the sushi was finished. &quot;But your parents didn&#39;t 
just let you go, did they? I mean, they would&#39;ve fought back or 
something, right?&quot;

&quot;Mm, they did,&quot; said Kailin softly, her voice embraced by sadness. &quot;They 
were killed right in front of me, and I couldn&#39;t even use my powers to 
save myself.&quot; Rin gave Kailin a sad, somewhat understanding look and 
placed her hand on the younger girl&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know. You don&#39;t have to say anything else.&quot; Kailin 
looked up and gave the older woman a little smile.

&quot;Well, I did escape, and I rescued BaoBao in the process. They were 
doing all kinds of terrible things to her, and I just couldn&#39;t leave 
that place without her, so we escaped together and fought them off. I&#39;ve 
been running for awhile now, but this is the first time they&#39;ve actually 
stopped me. Good thing I was able to ward them off.&quot;

&quot;...Yeah. But nine against one&#151;you must&#39;ve gotten your power under 
control in a hurry.&quot;

&quot;I had help,&quot; she admitted shyly. Kailin quickly pulled out a sling that 
had been on her back and dug through it. She fished out an apple and 
held it to Rin. &quot;Split one?&quot;

&quot;Sure. Oh, is this another excuse to see me cut things?&quot; Both girls 
grinned, and without needing any more hints, Rin stood up and cleaved 
the apple neatly in half as she threw it in the air. She caught both 
pieces and handed one to Kailin. When she ate it, she relaxed and found 
that the taste was perfect for after sushi.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m the chopper and masher, and you&#39;re the roaster. So what kinda 
help did you have?&quot;

&quot;I studied under a monk who specialized in dealing with fire,&quot; she 
explained. &quot;After my parents were killed and I escaped, I was aimless, 
and wandered everywhere. I kept setting things on fire by accident, and 
I could never stay anywhere for long without being noticed. Then my 
master, a man named Xiao, discovered me by accident&#151;meaning I sorta set 
something of his on fire while he was in town. He wasn&#39;t mad or 
anything&#151;actually, he looked kinda happy. He took me in and taught me 
how to control my powers, to an extent at least. I&#39;ve been seeing him 
for a year, and he says I&#39;m just beginning.&quot;

&quot;Huh, some beginning. You kicked ass and looked bored doing it. But I 
know how that is. So yours is a story of revenge and tragedy, eh? It 
seems my path might&#39;ve brought me here for a reason, since I really 
don&#39;t know where I&#39;m going. I&#39;ve been wandering around for months and 
the longest I&#39;ve ever stayed in one place was this shack a few miles 
back, for a week. That was Hell.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, your path might&#39;ve brought you here?&quot; Rin devoured 
half of her apple, tossed the seeds away, and wiped her dripping mouth 
with her sleeve. She stood and took one more bite before throwing the 
core in some tall grass.

&quot;I don&#39;t have a purpose; I guess I&#39;m just going around saving people. 
And here I met somebody who didn&#39;t need saving, but it looks like I 
might have work yet! I&#39;m sorry, I shouldn&#39;t assume, but do you, like, 
need my help or something?&quot;

&quot;You mean you&#39;ll help me?!&quot; Kailin bolted upright, flinging poor BaoBao 
and her sling to the dirt as she squealed. &quot;Oh, thankyou thankyou 
thankyou! I&#39;ve been looking for some friends and I was afraid my powers 
would scare everyone away! I&#39;m so glad,&quot; (she exclaimed, hugging Rin 
suddenly,) &quot;that I&#39;m not the only one like this! So you&#39;ll really help 
me, huh?&quot;

&quot;Uh, I guess I could.&quot;

&quot;Thank you!&quot; Kailin gave poor Rin a big kiss on the cheek; she was 
shoved away as lightly as Rin could manage.

&quot;Hey-hey, okay okay! No PDA, please; you&#39;re not my type.&quot; Kailin 
giggled, even though she had been tossed to the ground.

&quot;Hee-hee, ya don&#39;t like girls, huh?&quot;

&quot;I dunno. If you&#39;re finished, we should leave.&quot; Blink, blink.

&quot;Now?&quot; Rin shrugged.

&quot;If you want revenge, I&#39;m not waiting for winter. C&#39;mon, and leave that 
panda behind.&quot;

&quot;But Captain Cuddles is my partner! She and I go everywhere together!&quot; 
Rin snorted and gave the poor younger girl a rather harsh glare.

&quot;Lose the bear!&quot;

Kailin pouted, whimpered, and sniveled sadly. BaoBao squeaked. Rin 
rolled her eyes.

Two hours later, with Hsu Kai Lin riding piggyback and BaoBao in the 
sling, Rin just had to wonder how far her kindness could go before it 
ran out.

&quot;You okay back there?&quot; she grumbled for the third time. Kailin had her 
legs squeezed around Rin&#39;s waist and her arms draped over her chest, 
precariously close to her twin feminine treasures. A girl who could lift 
a small car wouldn&#39;t feel the weight of the two smallish creatures on 
her back, but the humiliation of having to hoist them at all was a 
burden enough. Kailin slapped Rin&#39;s shoulders playfully, and kicked her 
hips as if she were a horse.

&quot;It&#39;s so bumpy! And Captain Cuddles is hungry.&quot;

&quot;So feed her a bug. You can walk, you know!&quot;

&quot;Oh but...you go a lot faster than I do.&quot; Rin clenched her teeth, 
wishing that she had not been cursed with such fabulous strength (and 
not for the first time either).

&quot;I&#39;d go a lot faster if I had my bike,&quot; she grumbled. Kailin didn&#39;t hear 
her; she was starting to sing, and BaoBao decided that it was going to 
be a duet. Rin never did like music.

.........

There was only one good thing about being kidnapped by a wicked military 
branch bent on acquiring unnatural powers for their own use, and that 
was knowing exactly where their location was in the event a prisoner 
suddenly escaped and declared vengeance. Such was Kailin&#39;s case: 
although she had been drugged during the trip into the base, she had 
been wide awake running away from it, and the thrill of escape had 
imprinted in her mind its exact location. Of course, Rin didn&#39;t go there 
immediately; she went in search of her motorbike first, so that she 
wouldn&#39;t have to lug her new &quot;partners&quot; all the way herself. Besides, it 
was just cooler that way.

&quot;How ya like it?&quot; she yelled. Poor Kailin had never gone so fast without 
a seatbelt or a steel frame surrounding her, so she clutched onto Rin 
like a vice. BaoBao had been rudely stuffed into the sling and told 
harshly not to move (she was given some of the apple to keep her busy), 
but Kailin couldn&#39;t help but check on her poor &quot;baby&quot; every time the 
chopper went over a bump.

&quot;It&#39;s really fast!&quot; she screamed. Rin couldn&#39;t help but grin as she gave 
the chopper more gas and sped up, making her poor charge scream in 
terror. She wasn&#39;t cruel enough to perform any stunts; she just liked 
going fast. Now if only Kailin didn&#39;t squeeze so hard...

With Kailin&#39;s guidance, Rin made it to the base where she had been taken 
to. Kailin remembered it like one would remember a severe trauma, and 
clung tighter to Rin&#39;s body as she looked away and composed herself. Rin 
lifted the visor of her helmet and whistled: the base was huge, 
well-protected, and difficult to get into. Parts of it looked to have 
been through fires, perhaps courtesy of Kailin&#39;s handiwork. She squealed 
and forced herself to look at it, and remained tense.

&quot;The guards have doubled,&quot; she said thickly. Rin just sat there, 
eventually parking her bike off somewhere where it would remain 
concealed. She picked out her sword and told Kailin sharply to keep her 
sling with the bike and close it tight.

&quot;If you value your panda&#39;s safety, you&#39;ll do as I say. This is no place 
for her, or for us for that matter. You ready?&quot; Kailin looked frightened 
but nodded her head. She quickly tied a mask over her face and took 
several breaths to prepare herself. Rin swung her sword through the air 
a few times and crept back to the base, her partner in tow. BaoBao would 
have to take care of herself; she was given the rest of the food in 
hopes that she wouldn&#39;t wander off. Things were going to get ugly.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; said Rin, walking up to the four armed guards in front, 
&quot;we&#39;ve come here on urgent business and were wondering if we could&#151;&quot; The 
four instantly trained their weapons on her, nearly opening fire on the 
spot. She finished her statement bluntly: &quot;...Pass. Guess not.&quot; She 
revealed her sword in a flash and swung it twice, cleaving the guns 
apart. Two kicks sent half the force flying away; one grabbed her only 
to be flung away, and the other was picked up and hurled backwards. Rin 
quickly bolted around, aiming the point of her sword in his direction.

&quot;Don&#39;t move.&quot; She turned and followed Kailin inside, not surprised at 
all that an alarm was welcoming them inside. A wall of fire suddenly 
burst out from the ground, nearly scorching Rin as she tripped and 
skidded to a halt.

&quot;Get down!&quot; shouted Kailin. A flurry of bullets pounded themselves 
against the wall of flames, disintegrating like little shooting stars. 
Kailin raised one arm and sent fireballs soaring up to meet the 
automatic guns perched on the ceiling; explosions dotted the metal sky. 
She cringed and put all effort into lowering the fires, but the 
automatic sprinkler system doused them for her. Kailin made a loud 
groaning sound as her clothes started to get wet.

&quot;Great! Just great!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t just stand there, move it!&quot; Rin grabbed Kailin&#39;s arm and jerked 
her away, nearly breaking it off as she ran at top speed, shouting half 
the time: &quot;Where do I go? Which way do I turn?&quot;

&quot;Let go of my arm, let go of my arm!&quot; screamed her partner. Rin tumbled 
to a halt and released Kailin, whose complaints increased as she tried 
to get the feeling back in her arm. Rin came over to apologize and was 
pushed away.

&quot;Darn it, you nearly ripped it from its socket! Please be careful next 
time!&quot;

&quot;Well I couldn&#39;t just let you stand there like a fool! Why weren&#39;t you 
moving? What made you stop? If we&#39;re found out here, we may as well give 
up!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my clothes,&quot; sulked Kailin, standing up to shake herself dry. Rin 
gawked.

&quot;Your clothes?! Kailin, there are more important things to worry about 
than your stupid clothes!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t understand! I can&#39;t get them wet! Whenever I&#39;m around water, 
my power nearly dies on me! I have to concentrate twice as hard for half 
the affect!&quot;

&quot;Are you saying...that you can&#39;t use your powers?&quot; Rin forced her mouth 
shut as she ran her palm over her face, paced around, and sputtered. 
&quot;Well. This is nice.&quot;

&quot;I can still use my powers,&quot; Kailin assured her, &quot;just not very well.&quot; 
To prove it, she made a stressed face, and with a grunt, managed to 
ignite a small burst of fire from her palm before it quivered away. 
&quot;See?&quot;

&quot;Well, dry off quickly, I&#39;ll need your power&#151;shit!!&quot; Rin forced Kailin 
behind a doorway as she heard the sound of approaching footsteps. She 
forced her hand over Kailin&#39;s mouth and waited for them to subside. 
Kailin&#39;s breathing became louder, and she whimpered a little. Rin tried 
relaxing her grip, which surely must&#39;ve been painful. Finally, there was 
silence, and she released her partner.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she gasped, &quot;but next time, don&#39;t&#151;&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. Let&#39;s go, quickly now! Lead the way!&quot; The two partners 
sprinted off into another hallway, swerving this way and that as Kailin 
led them to where she believed the main sources of power were. Shutting 
down the facility was not her intention: she wanted to destroy it, and 
if possible, rescue the other &quot;experiment&quot; that she had befriended 
during her time there. Rin thought it best to look for the prisoner and 
see if they would join them; Kailin didn&#39;t want to split up and was in 
no mood to argue, so she traveled the base relying totally on her memory 
of the ghastly place. They turned one corner Kailin recognized, and saw 
the doorway into the lab. They also saw the two dozen guards waiting for 
them.

&quot;Oh, crap,&quot; said Rin. They opened fire. Rin jerked Kailin into her arms 
and ran back into the hallway, narrowly missing a holey end. &quot;Okay, so 
that was a bad idea!&quot; she yelled as she ran, Kailin moaning and yelping. 
&quot;Now whadda we do, huh? You&#39;re the one who knows this place the best!&quot;

&quot;Put...me...down...first!&quot; Rin skidded to a halt, found a spot to hide 
in, and released her partner, who had to pant just to breathe again. 
Takamatsu rolled her eyes.

&quot;And I&#39;m the one that did all the running.&quot;

&quot;Oh...knock it...off. I didn&#39;t...know...they&#39;d be...there.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but they knew that we&#39;d be there, so now what?&quot; Kailin slowly 
caught her breath, peeled off her dress, and tried to air it out. Rin 
respectfully gave her some privacy and watched out for any of the 
surrounding enemy.

&quot;There are too many in that direction for us to handle,&quot; she said, 
pointing where they had came from. &quot;And I don&#39;t wanna blow this place up 
until we&#39;ve freed my friend. Here, step back.&quot; She waved her hand and 
spat out a small fireball which to warm herself by. Rin didn&#39;t possess 
anything to make it stronger, so she helped air out Kailin&#39;s dress in 
the meantime.

&quot;Splitting up is no good,&quot; she surmised, &quot;and the only other option I 
know of is if we take them out little by little. But that might take us 
all day, and we&#39;re sure to be found out before long.&quot;

&quot;Right. Oh, wait a minute!&quot; As she hugged herself, Kailin looked up at 
the water pipes, then over to where they converged with the gas pipes 
that kept the place lit. She smiled as an embarrassingly simple solution 
came to her. &quot;Rin, can you jump up and tear those sprinklers out without 
setting them off?&quot;

&quot;Probably.&quot; She tried it and managed to just barely flick it off. Kailin 
called forth a little flame, no bigger than a match&#39;s fire, and held it 
up to the sprinkler. Nothing came from it. She sent the fire away and 
gave Rin a smile.

&quot;Oh, I see what you want to do,&quot; she said: &quot;You want me to break the 
sprinklers so they won&#39;t get you wet again, then we can go nuts on these 
fellas.&quot;

&quot;Well, no, not exactly. Once you tear out enough sprinklers, I want you 
to cut open those gas pipes you see. I seriously think we should free my 
friend, and after that, I can just make a little flick and the whole 
place will go down in flames.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and us with it. Besides, if those guards open fire&#151;&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to cut the pipes after we rescue her, dummy. Just make 
sure to break any sprinkler you see.&quot;

&quot;Well that puts us right where we started! What about those guards?&quot; 
Kailin looked back where they had came from, picking up the sound of 
approaching footsteps, and looked to her right. The hallway in that 
direction led into darkness.

&quot;Take out the sprinklers in this hallway. Hurry. We&#39;ll make our stand 
here. Don&#39;t worry, I think I&#39;m dry enough.&quot;

&quot;You think you are?!&quot; Rin made a face and groaned like she had never 
groaned before. &quot;Oh, great! Well, this isn&#39;t exactly the way I planned 
on dying, but whatever! May as well go down fighting. I don&#39;t like this 
one bit, but let&#39;s try your plan anyway. What&#39;s the worst that could 
happen, death?&quot; She grinned, and was off in a flash, slashing and 
breaking sprinklers all down the hallway. She turned around and sped by 
again, making sure to get the ones she missed before returning to 
Kailin&#39;s side. The whole process took exactly sixty-one seconds.

&quot;By the way,&quot; she said, &quot;they&#39;ll be here any second.&quot; Kailin grinned 
wickedly, spouting fire from her palms and the soles of her feet. Two 
fireballs shot out and surrounded her like the molecules of an atom. A 
wall of heat sprang up before her. Rin cracked her fingers and neck as 
she pulled out her sword. The footsteps came closer and louder and then, 
they became totally silent. It was now thirty against two.

The fireballs shot out as the wall grew, shielding the two girls from 
bullets just as Kailin&#39;s firepower struck back. Men yelped and shrieked 
as they were torched and burned; a few ignored the blasts and continued 
firing. Rin snarled, not wanting to lose the battle to a kid, and swung 
her sword as one of the strong bullets ripped its way past the wall. It 
cleaved the shell in half, sending both split sides falling harmlessly 
to the floor.

&quot;These guys are starting to piss me off!&quot; she shouted. Rin slammed her 
fist against the metal wall around them, shaking the entire section of 
the building. A few more crashes tore the metal siding off; she ripped 
it down and held it in front of her like a shield as she tackled the 
guards head-on. Rin plowed three of them down and hurled her new weapon 
so hard that it split several of the guards in two before it embedded 
itself into the wall. She screamed and went berserk, slicing down bodies 
in a massive orgy of bloody violence.

&quot;...Wow,&quot; said Kailin. She shook herself to her senses and joined Rin in 
the fray, hands and feet aflame. Each punch and kick was literally 
fire-powered, sending hot searing pain to everything it touched, 
courtesy of her Master Xiao&#39;s training. Between the two of them, the 
thirty guards dwindled rapidly, until none were left to stop them. 
Neither girl was breathing hard, having been well-instructed by martial 
artists. They turned around, smiled, and clasped hands.

&quot;Well done. But we&#39;ve not won yet; let&#39;s go.&quot; Rin hoisted Kailin on her 
back since the younger girl had no hope of keeping up, and together they 
ran back to the lab, destroying sprinklers as they went. If they were 
stopped, it was never by a massive crowd, and so the fights did not last 
long. Kailin tried her best not to get wet; Rin did her best to 
eliminate the sprinklers so they&#39;d stand a better chance of turning the 
whole place into a crater.

The lab was unguarded, but it boasted a steel security door so thick 
that even Rin couldn&#39;t knock it down. She was about to cut a huge hole 
in it with her sword, but Kailin stopped her, reached for the keypad, 
and typed in seven numbers. The door easily opened and allowed them 
entrance.

&quot;Where force fails, reason prevails,&quot; said the younger girl cheerfully. 
Noticing her friend&#39;s look, she giggled and added, &quot;I learned the code 
after hearing the scientists enter it in a few times. The buttons all 
have musical tones; for this one, it&#39;s D-E-A-D-C-A-B.&quot;

&quot;Dead cab?&quot; Kailin shrugged and led Rin into the lab. They split up 
temporarily and searched the whole place, but didn&#39;t find anyone or even 
anything, except a small letter that had been placed by an anonymous 
person. Kailin picked it up and read it.

&quot;&#145;To whom it may concern, this individual is now rightful property of TL 
courtesy of MT. Please do not look for us as you will never find us, 
although I do not doubt you will hear of us in the future. Respectfully, 
MT.&#39; It looks like somebody beat us here.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ve no purpose in staying, c&#39;mon!&quot; Rin quickly picked Kailin in 
her arms and rushed out to where the gas pipes had been, keeping in mind 
that she had to step over bodies and corpses along the way. She found 
one of the pipes and sliced it open with her sword, hearing the hiss of 
the escaping vapor.

&quot;Better leave soon. Kailin, I&#39;m going to go out through these walls. I&#39;m 
going to cut them down with my sword. Hang on and don&#39;t use your power 
until I tell you.&quot;

&quot;Okay!&quot; Rin sprinted off, faster than even Kailin could bear, and 
stopped only to cut three fast scars on the wall before them. She kicked 
down the wounded plaster and metal and traversed into the next room, 
where four or five guards were stationed on lunch break. Rin tossed 
Kailin into their mix, and created another hole while her partner easily 
disposed of the obstacle. In this way they proceeded, directly through 
the base, one wall at a time. Rin was a little more than halfway through 
when she told Kailin to turn around and fire.

Here goes nothing, she sighed, and squeezed off one single firebolt. 
Odd, really, that a single gesture would avenge countless years of 
torment, misery, and pain&#151;that one single flick of her fingers could 
dispense justice, that it could destroy evil, that it could put so many 
souls to rest and see to it that no one else was affected. This thought, 
like the fireball, was there and gone in a flash. Rin had knocked down 
three more walls before the sparks hit the gas leak and ignited.

&quot;Hang on!&quot; she screamed. Rin Takamatsu kept her sword out, but rarely 
used it as she put all of her power in running forward. She smashed 
every wall with her shoulders or a kick, breaking it just enough to let 
the two of them pass through. Kailin screamed as the rubble fell around 
her, but her ride was too quick to be buried. Even at that speed, 
though, she wasn&#39;t going fast enough: the fire was gaining, increasing 
in power, and the two girls were still not close to the exit.

&quot;I&#39;m sure gonna...feel this in the morning!&quot; grunted Rin as she forced 
her way through another wall. Alarms, guards, and guns were now the 
least of their worries: the flames were at their heels, and each wall 
was another delay. Soon, Rin could no longer afford to stop; she kept 
right on going, no matter how much it hurt or how loud her partner 
screamed.

&quot;Kailin!&quot; she screamed as the heat surrounded them slowly. &quot;A little 
help, won&#39;t you? Try to keep those fires down!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re too strong! I can&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Yes you can! Come on!&quot; Kailin stared hard at the charging fire in spite 
of its brightness, and put forth all her effort in staving them off. The 
wildfire somehow obeyed, and kept itself from creeping forward until the 
two girls were far away, running right out of the building and into safe 
clearing. Kailin didn&#39;t need anyone telling her to turn the heat back 
on, and with a bright flash, the military base that had caused her so 
much pain ended up being little more than rubble and ruin.

.........

Rin woke up before Kailin did, left a note, and wandered away. But she 
didn&#39;t get very far before she was stopped. Kailin stood before her, 
still in her pajamas with her arms crossed, looking annoyed and 
insulted. Rin just stood there passively, feeling a little guilty. Her 
partner held up the letter.

&quot;And what, pray tell, is this? Abandoning me so soon, eh? After all 
we&#39;ve been through?&quot;

&quot;Well, I just thought...&quot;

&quot;Wro-ong!&quot; she sang, pointing a finger at Takamatsu. &quot;See, you helped me 
out, but now my tale of revenge is complete! I avenged my parents and 
myself, but what do you think I&#39;ll do now? Like you, I have nowhere to 
go, so we may as well stick together and try to find another adventure 
to get mixed up in. Besides, I think I could find my friend if I stuck 
with you.&quot;

&quot;Kailin...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not gonna be talked out of this,&quot; she said, wiggling her finger. &quot;I 
think it would make a whole lot of sense for us to travel together. We 
kicked some tail back there at that base, didn&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;Well, yes.&quot;

&quot;And we both feel a lot more comfortable in each other&#39;s company, 
right?&quot; Rin had to admit it, she had a point.

&quot;Okay, fine. You have it your way. If there&#39;s no way I can convince you 
to leave, I guess there&#39;s no harm in you coming along. But you&#39;ll have 
to fend for yourself, and...you have to keep that panda away from me.&quot;

&quot;What an awful thing to say!&quot; she shrieked, holding BaoBao close. The 
panda made a cute growl and dug its stubby nose deep into Kailin&#39;s neck, 
forcing her to giggle. &quot;You just have to...get to know her better&#151;ack!&quot; 
Rin rolled her eyes as the two of them played with each other, and 
hoisted her pack up on her shoulders as she turned around.

&quot;If you&#39;re coming, you ought to come now. I have no business staying 
here.&quot;

&quot;Hey, wait! I&#39;m coming, just wait! Hold...still...Captain...Cuddles! 
There!&quot; Kailin managed to stuff the squirming panda cub in her sling, 
and trotted off after Rin, perhaps to another adventure or perhaps to 
nowhere at all; it didn&#39;t matter. The Ronin had now begun anew, and with 
each beginning there must surely be endless possibilities.

----------

The day is saved...but for how long?

Tune in next time when a familiar face finds out that revenge is never 
free, and the price is always too high to pay.

Which of her allies are friends, and which are foes in disguise?

All this and more in the next chapter, &quot;Desecration&quot;. Don&#39;t you dare 
miss it!
