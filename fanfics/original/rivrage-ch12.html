<a href="../original/rivrage-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>&#147;Hey! I think she&#146;s coming around!&#148;

Very slowly, Ayane&#146;s tired eyes opened up. The last thing she 
remembered was fighting Zanga. Now she was at a completely different 
place to Mizube Ai Park. White walls, bright light up on the ceiling. 
This place was a hospital. That damn Zanga had put her in hospital. It 
was now obvious to Ayane that she was laid up in bed. Her ribs hurt a 
lot, and her fists felt sore. But rather than worry about the pain, 
Ayane took a look around her. The first thing she saw was that 
heartbreaking look of worry on the face of Rinako.

Her beautiful, angelic Rinako.

Ayane&#146;s normally strong voice sounded weaker than she expected it 
would be. &#147;R-Rinako...&#148;  

Rinako was sitting next to Ayane&#146;s bed. She was the one who brought 
Ayane here. That battle with Zanga happened yesterday. And the 
defeated SBA leader got the distinct feeling that Rinako had been 
there with her all night. Rinako&#146;s eyes brightened as a little of 
Ayane&#146;s light came back to her. It made everything better to know that 
her love would pull through. With that bright smile still attached to 
her face, the Ikatsuji girl slipped her hand under the covers of 
Ayane&#146;s bed sheets, and linked hands with her girlfriend. 

&#147;How are you feeling?&#148; Rinako asked tenderly. &#147;Are you okay?&#148;

Ayane struggled to speak. &#147;I... I am... holding up. It&#146;ll... take more 
than... this to k-keep me down...&#148;

Rinako ran a hand through her locks of white hair. &#147;Try not to say too 
much, sweetie. I&#146;m glad you&#146;re feeling better.&#148;

Ayane managed to nod and then she looked over at the room itself. She 
and Rinako were not alone. Minato, Natsumi, Izumi and Mishizu where 
standing around the room, watching Ayane with mixed emotions. Ayane 
was stunned. Why had they all come here?

&#147;You all...&#148; Ayane mumbled tiredly. &#147;Why are you...?&#148;

Natsumi, with Minato on her arm, winked at Ayane. &#147;Hey, we couldn&#146;t 
just leave you here on your own. We wouldn&#146;t have felt right without 
coming to see you anyways. What kind of friends would we be?&#148;

Ayane smiled faintly. &#147;My... friends...&#148;

Izumi walked closer to the bed and took a seat on a small chair next 
to it. She was stunned by Ayane&#146;s defeat. The only person that had 
ever beaten Ayane in a fight was Rinako. But this Zanga broke that 
trend in a quick ten-minute match. This guy was a much bigger problem 
then he first seemed. 

Izumi looked over to her friend. &#147;You hang in there, Ayane. And don&#146;t 
worry about the gang. I&#146;ll take care of &#145;um until you get back to full 
health.&#148;

Ayane nodded. &#147;T-Thank you... Izumi...&#148;

Just then, a thought came to the white-haired girl&#146;s head. Her head 
turned back over to Rinako. &#147;Does... does my mother know how I am?&#148;

Rinako shook her head. &#147;I was gonna call her, but when the doctors 
told me that you would be okay, I decided to wait and see how you felt 
about it after you woke up. So do you want me to call her?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Ayane tried to shake her head to confirm it. &#147;I don&#146;t want her 
to worry... about me.&#148;

Rinako started stroking Ayane&#146;s cheek with her free hand. &#147;How could 
she not worry, sweetie? You know she does have a right to know about 
the well being of her daughter. I know I would be angry if I didn&#146;t 
know how you were doing.&#148;

Another smile was released from Ayane. &#147;But... I think that&#146;s... a 
little different.&#148;

Just then the door slammed closed. Mishizu was gone. Natsumi, Minato 
and Rinako were confused as to why she would just leave like that, but 
Ayane and Izumi had a fairly good idea why. Instantly, Izumi was on 
her feet, walking to the door.

She just briefly looked back at Ayane. &#147;I just quickly need to... grab 
a cup of coffee. I&#146;ll be back in a sec.&#148;

And Izumi was gone. It took the absence of Izumi and Mishizu for 
Rinako to realize what she needed to do. 

And so she looked over to Natsumi and Minato. &#147;Could you leave me and 
Ayane alone for a little while? We need to talk.&#148;

Natsumi and Minato both nodded, and walked out of the room. Then a 
more serious expression came to Rinako&#146;s face. Her honey brown eyes 
darted back to Ayane very quickly. 

&#147;Ayane.&#148; Rinako said chidingly. &#147;Why didn&#146;t you tell me that you were 
going to fight that guy? Why did you go there alone?&#148;

&#147;I wasn&#146;t alone...&#148; Ayane responded. &#147;Izumi was with me.&#148;

Rinako&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;That isn&#146;t even funny, Ayane. Why didn&#146;t you 
tell me? I would have been there...&#148;

&#147;I did not... want to worry you.&#148; Ayane struggled. &#147;Plus, you had 
so... much to think about... with your sister and... I just...&#148;

Rinako&#146;s stare softened. Ayane did it for her. &#147;I understand. You did 
this to protect me. That&#146;s just like you. But don&#146;t worry.&#148; Rinako&#146;s 
gaze then darkened harshly. &#147;I&#146;ll destroy that man for what he&#146;s done 
to you... I&#146;ll rip him apart...&#148;

It wasn&#146;t that simple. Not anymore. Ayane knew this. She had 
experienced Zanga&#146;s power first hand, and this fighter could not be 
underestimated by any length. 

&#147;Don&#146;t be... careless, Rinako.&#148; Ayane tightened the grip she had on 
Rinako&#146;s hand. &#147;He is... much stronger than... you think. While I was 
fighting... I tried to identify his style... it&#146;s... the thing... your 
father warned us of.&#148;

Rinako&#146;s eyes shot open. &#147;You mean Seiryoku o tsukaihatasu ken? The 
&#145;Burn out&#146; style? But I thought that fighting art died out years 
ago...&#148; 

&#147;Genzo was wrong.&#148; Ayane managed.

Rinako thought about that. Burn out style was legendary. Rumour has it 
that humanity was taught the style by demons thousands of years ago. 
In truth, it was a fighting art invented by Chinese assassins that 
emigrated to Japan in 1867. It was deadly, but so rare that many 
martial artists had never heard of it. The only reason that Genzo had 
known about it was because of a battle he had with one of its 
practitioners. A man named Ietsuna Minamoto. The battle was fierce and 
it left Genzo with a permanent scar over his back. Though it was a 
draw, Genzo knew Seiryoku o tsukaihatasu ken would be a threat to Rai 
shou en ken in the future. It seemed as if that time was coming.

&#147;Rinako...&#148; Ayane fought to get this out. &#147;Please don&#146;t fight him. 
I... I&#146;ve felt his power... he is dangerous...&#148;

She honestly couldn&#146;t answer that. Rinako had to make Zanga pay for 
what he did. But she didn&#146;t want to worry Ayane, either. This was 
getting more complicated than it needed to be. Still, things would 
happen when they happened. What mattered to Rinako now was Ayane. The 
amethyst-haired girl continued to run her fingers through Ayane&#146;s 
hair, still holding her hand softly under the covers.

**********

&#147;Mishizu...?&#148;

The young genius rubbed her eyes free of her tears. Izumi was a short 
distance behind her. It wouldn&#146;t do Mishizu any good to be caught 
crying like this in front of Izumi. 

Izumi herself had a concerned expression. She was honestly worried 
about Mishizu. It seemed like she was having trouble in hiding her 
feelings more and more these days. Izumi did feel the same way. There 
were times where she just wanted to grab Mishizu and shower the girl 
with undying love. But it was a little harder for Mishizu to deal with 
her feelings for Rinako. 

When Rinako was with Keiji, Mishizu could argue that the only reason 
they were not together was because of Rinako&#146;s sexuality. Now that it 
was revealed that Rinako *did* have attractions to other girls, that 
theory was out the window. Which also meant that the real reason that 
Mishizu and Rinako were not together was simply because Rinako was not 
attracted to the diamond-eyed genius. 

Though Izumi didn&#146;t know this for sure, she was fairly certain that 
this was the case. This threw even Izumi for a loop. Ayane was in love 
with Rinako? At first, she thought it was some kind of joke, but then 
she looked at the two of them. They were mad for each other. You could 
see it in their eyes. And, unfortunately, so did Mishizu.

Izumi doubted the idea that she was the right person to do this, 
but... &#147;So... Ayane and Rinako, huh?&#148;

&#147;...&#148; Mishizu would say nothing to respond. 

Regardless... &#147;I... I&#146;m sorry, Mishizu.&#148;

Suddenly that sadness within the Yakagi girl became anger. Izumi went 
out of her way to taunt and insult her feelings for Rinako, and now 
she&#146;s trying to console her?

&#147;For what?&#148; Mishizu said that with utter scorn. &#147;I thought you enjoyed 
watching me suffer.&#148;

Izumi knew it was the heartbreak saying that, but it still hurt. The 
situation was nothing like that. &#147;That&#146;s not true!&#148;

Mishizu&#146;s diamond eyes shot back at Izumi, tears staining them. &#147;It&#146;s 
not?&#148; She said sarcastically. &#147;What happened to &#145;did you really think 
she could see anything in you&#146;...? Remember that, Izumi?&#148;

She remembered that. Izumi&#146;s long indigo blue hair obscured her eyes 
as she hung her head lowly. &#147;I... didn&#146;t mean to upset you. I 
wasn&#146;t... trying to hurt...&#148;

Mishizu just turned back around and rested her hand on the white wall 
of the hospital hallway. Dealing with Izumi&#146;s mixed up mind was not on 
her agenda. From the girl&#146;s frustration, Izumi could tell that was 
handling this the wrong way.

&#147;Look.&#148; Izumi began. &#147;I-I&#146;m seriously sorry about saying all that 
stuff. And I&#146;m sorry about Rinako. I... know what it&#146;s like to have 
feelings for someone who doesn&#146;t love me back. I understand.&#148;

For once, Mishizu just managed to forget Izumi&#146;s position as second in 
command of the SBA and looked at her as a sympathetic soul. Some one 
who could understand. Fresh tears ran her eyes as her unrequited love 
came back to mind. 

&#147;Why doesn&#146;t she love me?&#148; Mishizu said in strain. &#147;Why can she not 
see how much I really care for her...?&#148;

Izumi looked away with a sad ironic smile. &#147;Yeah. Why can&#146;t she see?&#148;

Just then, a resolution set into Mishizu. What if Rinako knew about 
her feelings? Maybe there was a chance, a hope that it would get 
through to Rinako and make her see that Mishizu was the one. It had to 
work. Rinako had to know how she felt. The Yakagi-girl wiped the tears 
from her eyes and walked towards Ayane&#146;s room. 

Izumi noticed that change in Mishizu and held her arm to prevent her 
from going anywhere. &#147;What are you doing?&#148; Then it hit Izumi. &#147;You&#146;re 
going to tell her how you feel, aren&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;...&#148;

&#147;Well?&#148; Izumi asked desperately. &#147;Are you?&#148;

Though it was tough, Mishizu managed to speak. &#147;...Yes...&#148;

And though they were in a public place, Izumi&#39;s voice rose. &#147;Why?!&#148;

&#147;Because I have to.&#148; Mishizu&#146;s voice was almost blank...

&#147;Do you?!&#148;

Mishizu looked back at Izumi with heartbroken eyes. &#147;Yes. I do.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll wreck your friendship with her if you do this.&#148; Izumi said 
directly. &#147;She won&#146;t say anything back.&#148;

A tear fell down Mishizu&#146;s eye. She accepted that too. &#147;I know.&#148;

&#147;So then why?!&#148; Izumi asked angrily. 

&#147;Because I just don&#146;t care anymore.&#148; Mishizu tugged her arm free of 
Izumi&#146;s grip and made another slow walk for the door to Ayane&#146;s room, 
until Izumi again held her back.

&#147;Don&#146;t!!&#148; Izumi nearly screamed, restraining Mishizu frantically  

Mishizu looked blankly at Izumi. Why was she holding her back? What 
did this have to do with her? &#147;Why shouldn&#146;t I?&#148;

&#147;Because Rinako could never love you the way I can!&#148;

**********

Wham. Bang. The sounds of a heavy bag receiving the worst torture of 
its career. Kicks, palm strikes, punches, mid-knees, elbow rushes. 
Rinako Ikatsuji dispersed all that and much more on that poor heavy 
bag. In actual fact Rinako wanted to be by her Ayane&#146;s side, the idea 
of her alone in that hospital room was infuriating but what angered 
Rinako the most was that man.

Zanga. 

That bastard had hospitalised her love. He came out of nowhere, 
challenged Ayane and then did all that to her. Then he had the nerve 
to tell Rinako that she was next. 

It seemed like Rinako&#146;s anger increased every time she hit the heavy 
bag in her private training space. Mishizu was on the other side of 
the room, and it was about a day after Rinako and the others had 
visited Ayane. 

Following a good night&#146;s rest, Mishizu managed to keep her cool and 
not reveal her true feelings. After that episode with Izumi, she tried 
hard not to think too much about it. 

What Izumi said to her...

The young genius shook her head. More importantly than that, Mishizu 
was worried about Rinako. It was natural to be angry, and Rinako was 
the kind of woman that could get very angry, very easily. 

But this was different somehow. Usually when Rinako got mad, she would 
be all over the place and blow up at anything that came within three 
miles of her. Right now, she was extremely focused and resolute. Her 
determination was firm, but foreboding... almost dark. 

Not just that, but Mishizu was worried about Rinako&#146;s chances against 
Zanga. Fair enough, she was stronger than Ayane was, but Ayane wasn&#146;t 
exactly a pushover. Anybody who could take down the leader of the 
Spring Breeze Assassins had to be more than average. 

&#147;Rinako...&#148; Mishizu said concerned. &#147;Are you alright?&#148;

Rinako threw one final punch to complete her training. &#147;I&#146;m fine, 
Mishizu. Don&#146;t you worry about me. Worry about that damn Zanga when I 
get my hands on him.&#148;

&#147;Are you sure you want to do this? This guy must be very skilled.&#148;

Rinako&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;You don&#146;t think I can beat him?&#148;

&#147;I did not say that.&#148; Mishizu assured. &#147;But you can&#146;t ignore the power 
that it must have taken to do that to Ayane. He must be very 
physically powerful.&#148;

Tresses of Rinako&#146;s hair fell past her eyes. &#147;I&#146;m not afraid of him. 
I&#146;ve never felt this angry in my life. Not even when Ayane left me. I 
have to make him pay for this.&#148;

Just then, one of the Cross Blade Lancers walked through the door to 
Rinako&#146;s private training area with a piece of paper in her hand. She 
ran up to Rinako and presented it to her.

&#147;Here, boss.&#148; The girl said. &#147;This note came for you. From some gang 
called the Kyoto New Force Strikers.&#148;

Rinako gripped onto it. It was from him. &#147;Thanks, Nanako. You can go 
now.&#148;

The young girl nodded and ran back out through the door, shutting it 
as she left. Mishizu walked up to Rinako, who was now reading this 
note to herself. 

&#147;What does it say?&#148; She asked.

Rinako finished reading the note and scrunched it up. &#147;It was from 
them. They&#146;ve challenged me to a match with Zanga a week from now. 
They also want Tomeishuu as a prize for winning the fight.&#148;

&#147;What!?&#148; Mishizu yelled. &#147;You&#146;re not going to take up that offer, are 
you?&#148;

Rinako yelled back. &#147;I&#146;m gonna fight him, Mishizu!&#148; She barked. &#147;I&#146;m 
gonna fight him, and sure as hell I&#146;m gonna win! He can&#146;t get away 
with what he did to Ayane! I&#146;ll beat him... I swear it...&#148;

**********

&#147;Hey... Natsumi...&#148;

Minato wriggled around a bit. Her Natsumi held her on the sheets of 
her bed. It wasn&#146;t any extremely romantic or sexual, just two people 
cuddling each other. But right now, Minato could not relax. And 
Natsumi noticed this.

&#147;What&#146;s up, Minato?&#148; The miko asked.

Minato snuggled up a bit to get closer to Natsumi. &#147;I&#146;m really 
worried, Natsumi.&#148;

&#147;About Ayane?&#148; She questioned. &#147;She a tough girl. She&#146;ll be okay.&#148;

&#147;Not about Ayane, Rinako.&#148; Minato corrected. &#147;Ever since she came back 
from the hospital room she&#146;s been really focused on that guy and his 
gang.&#148;

Natsumi&#146;s eyebrows rose up. &#147;But isn&#146;t that a good thing? If she&#146;s 
well versed in all the guy&#146;s moves then she&#146;ll be in a good position 
to fight him.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, but... she seems so relentless, so driven. It&#146;s not like her. 
The Rinako I know is always in three corners of the world at every 
time. She isn&#146;t this... decided. It&#146;s like something&#146;s changed inside 
her, really quickly...&#148;

Natsumi was suddenly aware. She had suspicions that Rinako was the 
legendary &#145;Seal Child&#146;, descendant of the man who originally sealed up 
Aerolust. And saying that, Natsumi also got the feeling that the 
Aerolust might have possessed Zanga as well.

&#147;Are you sure about that?&#148; Natsumi asked. &#147;Why are you so certain 
she&#146;s changed somehow?&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t explain how I know, I just do, and that&#146;s all. I know it 
sounds weird, but I can... feel it.&#148;

**********

&#147;Alright you guys.&#148; Izumi said. &#147;I&#146;ve seen Ayane and she&#146;s pretty 
beaten up. But she&#146;ll be okay soon. I know she&#146;ll be back to her old 
self soon enough. Until then, as second in command of the Spring 
Breeze Assassins, I&#146;m taking control as leader.&#148;

The other members of the Spring Breeze Assassins all murmured between 
them. This was the first time in three months that the whole gang had 
been called together for an emergency meeting. The defeat of their 
leader Ayane was a great blow to the majority of the members. It 
wasn&#146;t so much that Ayane had been beaten; after all, she hadn&#146;t won a 
fight with Rinako in years (A/N During the duel of control, 23rd of 
every month. See chapter one). The real shock was that an outsider had 
beaten Ayane. To the majority, it was shocking, to the minority, it 
presented a great opportunity to usurp leadership. Izumi was a good 
fighter but not as powerful as Ayane. With her out of the way, 
internal radicals like Konoko felt that the time was right to make a 
move. 

The entire gang of the Spring Breeze Assassins (minus Ayane) were 
present at the rear of the sports hall, the training facility for 
Tomeishuu High&#146;s students. It was the only place this number of people 
could get together without looking suspicious. 

One of the girls spoke out to Izumi. &#147;Is this guy really as strong as 
people are saying?&#148;

Izumi nodded. &#147;Well, he put the boss in hospital. That should be 
enough proof of his strength.&#148;

Another of the girls spoke up. &#147;So what are we gonna do? Should we 
just sit back and let that jerk get away with it?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Izumi said calmly. &#147;This isn&#146;t our problem anymore. Ikatsuji and 
the Cross Blade Lancers are gonna see this through. And I know it 
sounds crazy, but... if it means getting rid of this guy, we might 
have to think about helping them.&#148;   

The whole group began murmuring again. Help the CBL? After all the 
battles fought between them? Even so, some girls did like the idea. As 
of the past three weeks, many people had been questioning the need to 
continue the war. Though they remained silent about their feelings, it 
was a fast growing view. But there were still some who wanted to keep 
the Spring Breeze Assassins and the Cross Blade Lancers at odds with 
each other.

Konoko happened to be one of them. &#147;I say Ayane&#146;s defeat has turned 
you soft, Wakabashi. I don&#146;t think you can handle control over the 
group.&#148;

Izumi looked over to Konoko. That idiot. &#147;Oh, shut the hell up, 
Konoko. We all know how much you wanna prove yourself to be something 
sweet, but you&#146;re just a small fry with a big mouth.&#148;

&#147;Oh yeah?&#148; Konoko jabbed. &#147;Both me and Ayane fought this guy, yet I 
was able to walk away. Ayane on the other hand, she wound up in an 
infirmary. Maybe my skills have surpassed the great and noble leader, 
eh?&#148;

That was it. Izumi stepped off the bench she was standing on the 
address the group, and walked over the young insurrectionist, staring 
her firmly in the eye.

&#147;I don&#146;t know who you think you are, Konoko.&#148; Izumi said hatefully. 
&#147;But if you don&#146;t like the way this gang is run, then gather up your 
crap and get the hell out. &#145;Cause we don&#146;t have no time for 
loudmouthed idiots like you.&#148;

Konoko piped up. &#147;Is that so? Well I think-&#147;

Instantly, Izumi, who grabbed her by the collar and shoved her up 
against the back of the sports hall wall, cut off Konoko. Izumi 
scowled scornfully at this girl. Ayane wasn&#146;t just her boss; she was 
Izumi&#146;s best friend. And having this punk run her mouth off was just 
too much to tolerate.

&#147;I&#146;ve had it up to here with you, Konoko. I swear, if we had the time 
for it, I&#146;d kick you out of the gang and beat your head around this 
school for sport games. But lucky for you we have bigger things to 
worry about. So do yourself a favour. Pull your head out of your ass 
and keep that sky-swallowing mouth of yours shut. Understand?&#148;

Konoko just nodded. She was ready to take Izumi on but when she looked 
over at the rest of the SBA girls, they all seemed to agree with 
Izumi. The last thing she needed was to get kicked out of the gang. 
That would make her vulnerable to everybody. Throwing Konoko one last 
scowl, Izumi relinquished her grip and walked back over to the rest of 
the group. 

&#147;So. This is the plan. In six days, Ikatsuji is gonna fight Zanga for 
control of Tomeishuu. Whether she wins or loses, we can&#146;t let three 
newbies rule us. We&#146;ll have to find a way to get rid of this gang, 
even if it means helping the CBL. Agreed?&#148;

The rest of the group nodded and yelled in acceptance of that. Even 
though the Cross Blade Lancers were their bitter rivals, this was more 
important than simple rivalry. This was about Tomeishuu pride. There 
was no way they could let a bunch of outsiders claim dominion over 
*their* school. Soon afterwards, gang dispersed. It was lunchtime 
after all classes would start again soon. As soon as everyone left, 
Izumi sat down on the bench she used before. It was tough as a leader. 
Ayane could be one crabby, anti-social nag when she wanted to, but it 
was understandable when you alone had to lead something. Hopefully, 
Izumi wouldn&#146;t have to put up with leadership for too long.

&#147;I hope this business is over and done with soon.&#148; She said under her 
breath. But she was not alone.

Another woman spoke to Izumi from behind. &#147;You really won&#146;t be able to 
defeat us you know.&#148;

Izumi swung around. It was that new girl, Shizuku Makuryu. &#147;You? What 
the heck are you talking about?&#148;

Shizuku bowed. &#147;Allow me to introduce myself. I am called Shizuku 
Makuryu. I&#146;m sure you already know who I am, but not whom I affiliate 
with. I am the third member of the Kyoto New Force Strikers.&#148;

Izumi&#146;s face twisted into anger. &#147;And you have the nerve to show your 
miserable face here? You arrogant little-&#147;

&#147;Formalities,&#148; Shizuku chipped in with, &#147;Mean nothing to us now. It&#146;s 
obvious that Ikatsuji cannot defeat Zanga. Look at what he did to the 
Yosukube woman. Make no mistake. We will rip through each and every 
one of you. Even if we need to do so one by one. Then this school will 
be ours. And all of the gangs in Tokyo will tremble at our name 
because we did the impossible. Seizing control of this place.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re nuts!&#148; Izumi shouted. &#147;You really think you can take on the 
SBA *and* the CBL? You&#146;re dreaming, honey.&#148;

With a quick smile, Shizuku tossed her forest green hair over her 
shoulders and cracked her firm knuckles by both hands. &#147;So, you think 
we are a bunch of amateurs, do you? Well how about a small sparring 
session between the two of us? Just for fun.&#148;

Izumi grinned. She wasn&#146;t Zanga but a small one on one with this 
Shizuku girl felt like pay back for what he did to Ayane. Quickly, she 
stood up from the bench and walked over to the other girl, then 
stopped. Izumi&#146;s slender arms took on an exotic stance, something 
traditional of Tai Chi fighters, and her eyes locked down on Shizuku.

&#147;You&#146;re on.&#148; 

Shizuku just smiled. {A Japanese-borne who fights with a Chinese 
style. Just like Zanga. Heh... unfortunately for her, she does not 
have my power...}

Just then, Mishizu walked around the side of the Gyms. She had a 
Tennis class that ran rather long, and she had just gotten out. To her 
surprise, she saw Izumi about to do battle with Shizuku. The last 
thing she wanted to do right now was to break up a fight but she had 
to talk to Izumi. After what she had said to Mishizu yesterday, 
everything that Izumi had done to her started to make sense. The way 
she acted, the things she said. They were all a part of Izumi&#146;s 
feelings for Mishizu.

The two girls ran in on each other, both raising their fists to 
strike. But Izumi could only blink as Shizuku&#146;s true power was 
revealed. As the navy-haired girl threw her hand out in a palm strike, 
Shizuku swerved to the side, and buried her fist into the core of 
Izumi&#146;s stomach. Izumi gasped sharply, almost urgently, as the breath 
she had, vanished. But that was not all.

Izumi froze, and feet suddenly became as wobbly as jelly. With a 
disturbed yell, she toppled onto the ground, realizing that she did 
not have the ability to stand under her own power. 

The midnight-eyed girl looked upwards at an amused Shizuku. &#147;W-What 
did you do to me?!&#148;

&#147;That was a skill of my fighting style, &#145;Shinkei saki hason ken&#146; 
(Nerve point break fist). That skilful technique you just felt was my 
&#145;Mahi-ouda&#146; (Paralyse blow). It discharges some of my Ki into certain 
parts of the nervous system, disabling specific abilities, such as the 
power to stand. I don&#146;t usually use moves like that on an amateur but 
I think you need to be put in your place.&#148;      

Izumi scowled hatefully at Shizuku as she walked away, laughing 
recklessly. &#147;I&#146;ll get you for this, Makuryu...&#148; Izumi seethed that out 
with contempt. &#147;I&#146;ll get you!&#148; 

&#147;Izumi!&#148;

The heart of the girl in question twanged. She knew exactly whose 
voice that belonged to. Mishizu. And not surprisingly, Mishizu was 
running up to her. Izumi looked away. Not only was it humiliating to 
have suffered such a quick defeat at Shizuku&#146;s hands, but also now 
Mishizu was here. After confessing her love to the girl yesterday, 
Izumi was thrown by the way Mishizu had no answer for her. There was 
no way she could face this.

Mishizu crouched down and inspected Izumi&#146;s legs upon reaching her. 
&#147;Izumi, are you alright? What did she do to you?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148; Izumi said dejectedly. &#147;Just leave me alone.&#148;

Mishizu took no notice of Izumi&#146;s demands and started a gentle probing 
of Izumi&#146;s right leg with the tips of her fingers. She was studying to 
be a nurse in her future, so this kind of thing was something she had 
to work at some day. 

Izumi stared hard at the genius. &#147;What are you doing...?&#148;

&#147;Whatever that girl did, it wasn&#146;t permanent. But you might not be 
able to walk around very quickly for the next few hours. There is only 
so much I can do, really.&#148;

Izumi completely ignored what Mishizu just said. &#147;You&#39;re helping me? 
Even though I&#39;m an SBA? Even after what I said?&#148;

Mishizu said nothing. 

&#147;...Even though you don&#39;t feel the same way?&#148;

&#147;Please stop talking!&#148; Mishizu stressed &#147;You might cause an injury if 
you push yourself too hard.&#148;

However Izumi was undeterred. &#147;Why are you looking after me?&#148;

&#147;I don&#39;t know! Please stop it, Izumi.&#148;

&#147;Why? So you can ignore what I said to you? How I feel? For god&#39;s 
sake, Mishizu, just tell me how you feel about me. I&#39;m not a little 
girl who&#39;ll go crying in her daddy&#39;s lap just because she didn&#39;t get 
what she wants.&#148; 

This was the one thing Mishizu regretted. Izumi&#146;s feelings. She didn&#146;t 
mind that Izumi loved her like that, but she felt so foolish for 
scolding Rinako about being blind to love, when she was doing the same 
thing. 

&#147;...I don&#39;t have feelings for you.&#148; Mishizu admitted. &#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;...So then what are you doing here, looking after me?&#148;

Mishizu smiled a little. Even though she was in a Tennis class, she 
could here Izumi declarations from the inside of the Gyms. Although, 
she didn&#146;t know that it was Izumi was speaking. &#147;I heard the way you 
rallied the SBA. It was impressive.&#148;

&#147;It was?&#148;

&#147;Of course.&#148; Mishizu said. &#147;You are not exactly a demagogue but you 
moved them well enough. That&#39;s worthy of some credit.&#148;

&#147;It&#39;s something you would have done if you needed to.&#148; Izumi 
responded. 

&#147;Maybe so. I assume I was just thrown by seeing another side to you.&#148;

Izumi chuckled a little. &#147;Wow.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;We&#39;re being nice to each other. It&#39;s a bit of a stretch for us.&#148;

Mishizu nodded. That was true. Considering the history between them, 
to be able to talk like this was confusion. But Izumi&#146;s feelings 
changed everything. &#147;I suppose it is.&#148;

&#147;So...&#148; Izumi began. &#147;What&#39;s next?&#148;

&#147;...This.&#148;

Mishizu stopped working on Izumi&#146;s leg for a brief second, and shifted 
over to her face. With an innocent smile of hers, she place the most 
gentle and faint of angel-like kisses on Izumi&#146;s cheek. Not only was 
Izumi startled but also a sensation that rivalled fire danced in her 
heart. Mishizu pulled back, still smiling. It was weird but all the 
bad blood of the past between the two of them was fading very quickly.   

Izumi&#146;s cheeks were red as all hell. &#147;W-What was that for...?&#148;

&#147;That was for stopping me from telling Rinako how I felt about her the 
other day. I risked my friendship with her because of that and you 
stopped me from hurting myself even more. Thank you, Izumi.&#148;

&#147;S-Sure...so... are you saying that you&#39;re over Rinako?&#148;

Mishizu&#146;s diamond-eyes became distant. &#147;I&#39;m not sure. I still love her 
and part of me always will. But I know that her heart doesn&#39;t belong 
to me. And I am not going to chase after a false hope anymore. All it 
will do is cause me more pain. I finally see that was what you were 
trying to tell me, these past two years.&#148;

Izumi forgot her jumpiness to confirm that. &#147;I&#39;m glad you see that.&#148;

&#147;Well, thank you. For it all.&#148;
